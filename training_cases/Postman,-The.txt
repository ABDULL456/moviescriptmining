76 BALL 
The Postman grabs the wrench, starts working one of the last two rusted bolts. As it starts to give... 
THE POSTMAN It's going to take a second.    I got my stuff bolted in. 
BANDITS 
The Lead Bandit takes a cautious step back. 
LEAD BANDIT Put some buckshot through it, Martin. Just to hurry him up. 
HULKING BANDIT I only got three shells left. 
LEAD BANDIT So use his gun. 
The Hulking Bandit picks up the carbine and aims. CLICK. It isn't loaded. The Hulking Bandit tosses the gun aside, pulls a knife from his boot. Grimly, he begins to climb. 
76 BALL 
Cramped, The Postman's busy at the base of the ball, trying to unscrew the last remaining bolt. It won't budge. 
LADDER 
The Hulking Bandit has only a few more rungs to go. 
76 BALL 
No good.   Time's up.   The Postman starts rocking the pole. 
LADDER 
The Hulking Bandit has reached the opening -- feels the rocking motion. Hangs on.

76 BALL 
Knife in hand, the Hulking Bandit looks inside. At that instant, The Postman rocks the pole one more time. The rusty bolt is not enough to keep the ball's full weight in place. It pops. The ball is frozen for an instant before going with the pole's tilt. 
LADDER 
The 76 ball drops off the pole, rolling over the Hulking Bandit's back and down the ladder's incline. The other Bandits dive clear as the 76 ball hurtles past. 
THE POSTMAN 
whips head over heels as the ball speeds away. 
FIELD 
The 76 ball launches off a dirt berm, but soon comes to a stop as it slams into an old utility pole and bursts apart. Fighting the vertigo, The Postman staggers to his feet. 
THE POSTMAN Bill! 
Bill bolts from the station as the Lead Bandit raises the RIFLE and FIRES at The Postman. 
Losing balance, The Postman lands on his butt just before a bullet splinters the utility pole above his head. Wobbly, he tries to gather his packs. The Bandits charge, quickly closing the ground, but Bill is there first. 
Holding as much as he can, The Postman heaves himself over Bill's back. As the mule gallops away, the Lead Bandit aims the rifle. He's got The Postman in his sights. 
He's about to fire when -- Bandit #20 stands up INTO the SHOT. He's got a fistful of cigarettes in each hand and he's laughing like a hyena! 
BANDIT #20 We're rich! 
9    EXT. OVERLOOK HILL (IDAHO) - DAY                             9 
The Postman sits on a rock, holding Bill's halter so the mule must face him. They are in the midst of an argument. 
THE POSTMAN It's true, we haven't done this in a while, but it's like riding a bicycle. Now, open your mouth. 
The Postman pries his mouth open. Taking a toothbrush, he tends to Bill's teeth, then gives him an appraising look. BILL BRAYS. 
THE POSTMAN I know the rule. It's my rule! Avoid civilization at all costs. But we gotta eat, don't we? (as BILL BRAYS again) What are you so worried about, Bill? All you gotta do is stand there. I'm the one with all the lines. 
The Postman leads the mule down the hill toward the town far below. Making his case all the while -- even as BILL BRAYS in protest. 
10   EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE (IDAHO) - DAY                            10 
A patch of mud. In the center of the square fifty townspeople stand before a plank stage where The Postman wraps up a performance of MacBeth. He plays it with a mis-remembered gusto the people enjoy. Children especially are enamored. A heavily-muscled man, WOODY, lingers on the fringe of the crowd -- watching The Postman with inscrutable intensity. 
THE POSTMAN They said, 'Fear not, MacBeth, 'til Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane'! 
He looks off stage for someone, but no one appears. 
THE POSTMAN I said, Birnam Wood comes to Dunsinane! 
Bill trots on-stage. Covered with twigs, BILL is Birnam Wood. He BRAYS lustily. The audience laughs in delight. The children clap. Only Woody seems unaffected. 
(CONTINUED) 
10   CONTINUED:                                                     10 
The Postman grabs two wooden swords -- he knows it's going well. 
THE POSTMAN Arm, arm yourselves! If the witch's words are true, there'll be no running or hiding here! 
Shaking off the twigs, Bill takes one of the swords in his mouth. The two of them dash back and forth pretending to fight off an imaginary attack. Finally, The Postman looks out at the audience, remembers the words the best he can. 
THE POSTMAN Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and the day after that. Out brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player that struts his hour upon the stage and is heard no more. It's a tale told by a moron. Full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. (waves sword) But blow, wind! Come wrack! At least we'll die with the harness off our back! 
The audience erupts in applause. But Woody stands still as stone. The Postman takes a bow. Even Bill does a cross-legged dip. Knowing when to quit, he steps off the stage to many hearty handshakes. 
Woody watches his every move. MRS. THOMPSON, one of the town's leaders, steps up. She's accompanied by crotchety old CURMUDGEON LARRY. 
MRS. THOMPSON The children have never heard Shakespeare before. 
THE POSTMAN (grinning) They still haven't. 
BETHLEHEM I want pure blood. Someone like... 
Bethlehem notes the Boy, turns to see the object of his attention, and spots The Postman leaving out the front gate. 
BETHLEHEM That man. 
Idaho and another soldier are on it. The Postman tries to back away as the two dismount and come toward him. 
THE POSTMAN You don't understand... 
But Idaho and the soldier aren't programmed for explanations -- they grab him. 
IDAHO You were required to show yourself. 
THE POSTMAN But, I'm not with these people. I'm just passing through. I -- 
Idaho silences him with a rifle butt to the head. Everything falls OUT OF FOCUS 
IDAHO (O.S.) Take the mule. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
11   EXT. HOLNIST TRAINING CAMP (WESTERN IDAHO) - DAY             11 
Spread out in the valley is General Bethlehem's Holnist Expeditionary Force. A five hundred-man army enjoying all the comforts a bivouac can offer. 
19 head-shaved CONSCRIPTS, including Woody and The Postman, are held in a cramped, barbed wired pen. They watch as three more are shoved inside. One of them is Bandit #20. He and The Postman come face to face, recognize each other. 
BANDIT #20 Hi. 
THE POSTMAN (astonished) Hi? 
The Postman steps toward him, Bandit #20 backs off quickly. 
BANDIT #20 Well... I mean, we know each other, kind of... 
THE POSTMAN Kind of. 
BANDIT #20 (looking around) Wow! 
THE POSTMAN So what did you guys do with my cigarettes? 
BANDIT #20 We traded them for a woman. 
THE POSTMAN Wonderful.   What happened to your partners? 
BANDIT #20 They traded me to the Holnists. 
GUARD (O.S.) Ten hut! 
General Bethlehem approaches on horseback. Colonel Getty follows behind. Bethlehem looks his new recruits over. Dismounting, he enters the pen and walks among them. 
(CONTINUED) 
11   CONTINUED:                                                      11 
BETHLEHEM Welcome, gentlemen, to your new life. You have been born again as soldiers in the army of the United Clans of Holn. The strong have been sapped by the whimpering propaganda of the weak. Men, strong men, have been denied their destiny. You men have been saved from that fate. Redemption is within your grasp. 
He starts down the line, looking the men over. He stops in front of a GANGLY RECRUIT. The Postman is alongside. 
BETHLEHEM You. What did you do before you were given this opportunity? 
GANGLY RECRUIT I had a shovel. I digged holes. 
Bethlehem regards him benevolently. 
BETHLEHEM You digged holes... Well, now you're going to fill them. (turns to Postman) And you? 
THE POSTMAN Me? 
BETHLEHEM Is there any question in anyone's mind that I was talking to you? Yes, you. You look like a dangerous man. Are you? 
THE POSTMAN I'm just a performer. Shakespeare. Stuff like that. 
BETHLEHEM Shakespeare? 
THE POSTMAN He was a writer. He -- 
BETHLEHEM I know who Shakespeare was... 'Cry "Havoc!" and let slip the dogs of war.' 
(CONTINUED) 
11   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               11 
Bethlehem says the lines boldly, encourages his men to clap for him. He looks at The Postman expectantly. Finally... 
THE POSTMAN I, um, you want a line? 
Bethlehem nods.     The Postman thinks a moment... 
THE POSTMAN 'To be or not to be: That is the question.' 
Bethlehem looks at his men as if to say, "Is this all this guy's got?" Bethlehem eyes The Postman; he wants a contest. 
BETHLEHEM 'We few, we happy few, we band of brothers.' 
The Holnists clap, they know their General can best this guy. 
THE POSTMAN (gaining confidence) 'Now is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of York.' 
Bethlehem claps The Postman on the back. 
BETHLEHEM You're pretty good. You're also a fighter. I see it in your eyes. 
The Postman doesn't answer. Hesitant, he doesn't want to get into any more trouble than he's already in. 
BETHLEHEM Don't you agree? Come on, a man's got to speak his mind. 
Bethlehem sounds sincere.    He seems like a good guy. 
At the mention of this name, the RECRUITS shout as one. 
RECRUITS God rest his soul! 
THE POSTMAN (low) May he burn in hell. 
Getty looks over at him. He heard him. The Postman swallows hard. Getty stares hard. Then he turns away. He's not going to bust him on it. 
BETHLEHEM These are the laws that we live by. The eight is our symbol. Each man will bear it with pride. 
Bethlehem nods at Idaho who pushes up his own sleeve to reveal the branded 8. 
BETHLEHEM Only then will you be part of the clan. Sit down, gentlemen. 
The men move to sit in one of the three rows. Only then does it become apparent that there are 18 men and only 17 chairs. One SLOW RECRUIT is left standing. It doesn't take him long to realize that he's in trouble. 
BETHLEHEM Law One. You will obey orders without question. (to Slow Recruit) I told you to sit. 
SLOW RECRUIT (scared) There weren't enough chairs. 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED:                                                        14 
BETHLEHEM I didn't specify chairs. You could've sat down on the ground. 
The Slow Recruit moves to do so. 
BETHLEHEM You disobeyed a direct order.    You broke Law One. 
Idaho and another soldier step up beside the Slow Recruit. 
BETHLEHEM Law Two.   Punishment shall be swift. 
They hustle the Recruit to the tree. Idaho unslings a coil of rope, throws it over a tree limb. They quickly slip a loop over the Slow Recruit's ankles and haul him upside down into the air. 
BETHLEHEM Law Three: Mercy is for the weak. Four: Terror will defeat reason. Five: Your allegiance is to the clan. Six: Justice can be dictated. Law Seven. Any clansman may challenge for leadership of the clan. Does any man here wish to challenge me? 
There are no takers. 
BETHLEHEM On your feet! 
The conscripts stand like jackknives snapping open. 
Without a word, without a look -- Bethlehem reaches out and draws a sword from a sheath that Getty holds. Bethlehem steps to the Slow Recruit -- who slowly twists around. 
BETHLEHEM Law Eight: There is only one penalty: Death. 
Bethlehem raises the sword. 
SLOW RECRUIT Please, I'm begging you. 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 14 
THE POSTMAN 
As the sword finds its mark.     Bethlehem looks at him, but addresses all. 
BETHLEHEM You will get out of this army what you put into it. Work and you'll be fed. Fight and you'll be respected. Die and you'll be remembered. It's up to you. 
Bethlehem turns and walks away.     Getty following behind. The Postman watches as they go.     Idaho steps up to him. 
IDAHO You thinking of challenging for leadership of the clan? 
THE POSTMAN No, sir.   I'm a follower not a leader. 
IDAHO You see Colonel Getty? Always following the General? He's the only man who ever challenged. Fight lasted six seconds, but the General didn't kill him. He cut off his tongue and he cut off his balls and old Getty's been following him like a dog ever since. 
The Postman looks back to see Bethlehem and Getty disappear into the gloom. Idaho grins, likes how this affects a new man. 
The Postman moves on.     Idaho stops Woody as he passes. 
IDAHO The General don't see it, but I say you got some nigger in you. 
Woody clenches his jaw, but wisely doesn't answer. 
15   EXT. PLAINS - DAY                                                 15 
Rain as the army moves. Boots suck at the mud. War wagons heave out of ruts. A monster gun is mounted on an old John Deere semi, pulled by a team of ten horses. The conscripts fill the middle ranks, each bearing a heavy pack. 
(CONTINUED) 
15   CONTINUED:                                                      15 
Marching beside Woody, The Postman stares blankly ahead. The cry to halt. The conscripts unsling their packs, catch their breath. Idaho pulls The Postman out of line. 
IDAHO The General would like a word with you, Shakespeare. 
16   INT. GENERAL BETHLEHEM'S TENT - DAY                             16 
Bethlehem stands before a painter's easel, palette in hand. He's got a mirror set up so he can see his reflection. He's doing a self-portrait in the tradition of the great Dutch Masters -- but it's a dismal failure. 
He continues painting even as Idaho leads The Postman in. Idaho salutes, steps back. For a moment, The Postman doesn't quite know what to do. 
BETHLEHEM (re: the book and binoculars on the table) They're yours. A solitary man, aren't you? Binoculars. To watch life from a distance. And Shakespeare. To read about it instead of living it. 
Bethlehem wants an answer.    The Postman clears his throat. 
THE POSTMAN No offense, General, but you seem to have read some Shakespeare yourself. 
BETHLEHEM If he wishes to rise above mere thuggery, a military commandeer must be classically educated. Philosophy, history. Even a sense of the dramatic. (a beat) Do you know what I did before the war? Do you think I was in the army? I sold copying machines. I was a salesman. The talent to lead men and devise and execute a battle plan were locked away inside me. 
(CONTINUED) 
16   CONTINUED:                                                     16 
He picks up Finding A Way to Win by Nathan Holn.     A 20- year-old self-help book. 
Bandit #20 can't contain his giggling, so Idaho backhands the sound out of him -- then looks back to The Postman. 
Grim The Postman starts forward, looks from the rotten bridge to the water and back again as he moves. 
All eyes on him as he starts across... 
20   EXT. BRIDGE - DAY                                              20 
The Postman steps lightly. Far below, the river rages. A knotty plank starts to crack underfoot. Scooting off it, he takes a last look around. Continues across to... 
21   EXT. WEST RIDGE - DAY                                          21 
The soldiers greet him -- unholy smiles on their ugly mugs. They point him ahead, prod him forward toward a trail of wet blood which leads deeper into the thicket. 
Stooping, The Postman enters. The soldiers split off and track along with him on either side of the thicket. 
22   EXT. THICKET - DAY                                              22 
Thorns catch and tear at his clothes as The Postman pushes his way through. He freezes. Ahead, sprawled and twisted, the mauled, bloody corpse of a Holnist soldier. 
SOLDIER (O.S.) Why are you stopping? 
THE POSTMAN I found him. 
SOLDIER (O.S.) He alive? 
Clearly he is not. 
THE POSTMAN Yeah. 
SOLDIER (O.S.) Bring him out. 
The Postman heaves the corpse onto his back. Rising, steadying himself, he looks back over his shoulders at a GUTTURAL GROWL. He hurries forward. 
ARMY 
Everyone stares across the river, straining to see as The Postman emerges with the corpse on his back. 
ON BRIDGE 
The Postman starts across, hampered by his burden.   He pauses, at his feet, the cracked, knotty plank. 
IDAHO (across river) Hurry up! You still got a lion to bag! 
The Postman decides, deliberately steps on the PLANK. CRACK. The Postman and the corpse drop thirty feet down, disappear in the river below. 
The corpse surfaces first, floats in the water. 
Then The Postman. Farther down the river. Swimming downstream with powerful strokes. Between his efforts and the current, he's being quickly swept away from the Holnists. 
As Bethlehem's eyes narrow in fury. 
(CONTINUED) 
22   CONTINUED:                                                     22 
A RIFLE BARKS a SHELL BACK after The Postman, but he disappears around a bend in the river. 
Bethlehem signals to two soldiers. They start running along the east ridge toward the riverbend. 
Two more start across the bridge to the west -- moving with military precision. 
Bethlehem wheels toward the conscripts, points out Woody. 
BETHLEHEM In the water. Come back without him and you and another man will die in his place. 
Woody dives in the water. Bethlehem looks to Idaho who dives in as well. Conscripts buzz with nervous excitement. 
CONSCRIPTS Go!   Go! 
BANDIT #20 (caught up) I'll get him, sir. 
He takes off running across the bridge. 
23   EXT. RIVER - DAY                                               23 
A fallen tree spans the river. As The Postman is swept beneath, he reaches up and catches hold. Pulling himself out of the water, he scrambles for the west shore. He disappears into the woods as two soldiers appear. 
They catch hold of the tree, look to the west banking, see footprints in the mud where The Postman pulled himself out. They start after him. 
24   EXT. CLEARING - WOODS - DAY                                    24 
Clothes in tatters, his lungs ready to burst, The Postman stops. He takes cover as the two soldiers run past. 
Breathing hard, The Postman steps out, starts across the clearing. He's halfway when Bandit #20 steps out from the trees. They look at each other for a moment. 
THE POSTMAN Just let me go. I don't want to be part of your army. 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:                                                    24 
Bandit #20 hesitates for a moment, then breaks into a grin. 
BANDIT #20 My army.   I like the sound of that. 
The Postman gestures with his knife. 
THE POSTMAN Don't -- 
BANDIT #20 I got him!   Over -- 
The Postman lunges, digs into Bandit #20's gut.   He blinks in surprise, then sags to the ground. 
The Postman takes a step back. A shadow falls over him. It's Woody. Staring down at The Postman. They can hear others approaching from the river. 
WOODY They sent me to kill you. 
THE POSTMAN Come with me. 
His hair growing back nicely, The Postman has reached the proverbial fork in the road. He considers his two options: "Pine View -- 32 miles." Or "Ridgemont -- 220 miles." He looks the two roads over, thinks. 
THE POSTMAN Well, that's easy. 
29   EXT. GATES (PINE VIEW, OREGON) - DUSK                           29 
The town is protected by a tall, long palisade.     Like Ft. Apache. All is dark as The Postman approaches. 
THE POSTMAN Greetings, Pine View, Oregon! 
TWO SENTRIES appears from the gate house.    They aim arrows. 
SENTRY #1 Just head back the way you came. Pine View ain't buying, ain't listening and don't give charity. 
A moment of truth is here.    Finally, with authority: 
THE POSTMAN Civilian, I'm on official business. I demand entry into the town of Pine View. 
SENTRY #2 What the hell are you talking about? 
THE POSTMAN I'm through talking to you, buddy boy! Now get somebody with authority to open this gate! 
More silhouettes appear on the palisade.     One is SHERIFF BRISCOE, a big, no-nonsense man. 
BRISCOE I'm Sheriff Briscoe. Who the hell are you? 
THE POSTMAN I'm a representative of the United States Government -- 
An uproar.    He makes himself heard above it.

29   CONTINUED:                                                      29 
THE POSTMAN Authorized by order 417 of the restored Congress to reestablish a communication route to Idaho and lower Oregon. Now open that damn gate! 
BRISCOE What does that mean in English? 
THE POSTMAN I'm your postman! 
There's a silent hush. 
BRISCOE (to someone on wall) Hand me your gun. 
THE POSTMAN Understand that tampering with or obstructing the mail is a federal offense. Furthermore, the Bolin Act requires you to provide all mail carriers with sanctuary and nourishment. (starting forward) Now open that damn gate! 
BRISCOE You got three seconds to get your ass outta here. 
THE POSTMAN Is Jerry the contractor here? 
Briscoe pumps his shotgun, aims it at The Postman. 
THE POSTMAN Wait! I'm going to get something out of my bag. 
The Postman dumps the pack over, frantically shuffles through the letters. 
BRISCOE One! 
THE POSTMAN Paul Davis!   124 Vernon Street! 
BRISCOE Never heard of him. Two!

BRISCOE Three! 
He fumbles for the last letter.       Briscoe takes aim. 
THE POSTMAN Irene March!   478 River Road! 
There's an absolute stunned silence.      Like a switch was thrown. 
30   EXT. INSIDE GATES - DAY                                          30 
The crowd parts as everyone turns to look back at IRENE MARCH. Mrs. March, in her late 50s, is blind, her eyes clouded by cataracts. In disbelief... 
MRS. MARCH Did he say my name? 
The sense of hope is palpable as the gates are swung back. Two TOWNIES hurry Mrs. March out to meet The Postman. They're followed by a throng. As he sees she's blind... 
THE POSTMAN Oh, no... 
Too late now. They stop Mrs. March in front of him.        She stares off just to his left, a little afraid. 
MRS. MARCH I'm Irene March. 
THE POSTMAN (uncomfortable) I have a letter for you. 
He presses it into her hands, but she won't take it. 
MRS. MARCH Would you read it? 
THE POSTMAN I'm sure it's personal. 
MRS. MARCH Please.   Someone has to.

The Postman has little choice.     As he opens the envelope... 
THE POSTMAN We're delivering the old stock piles, but I'll accept all new correspondence as well. 
TOWNIE Just read it, will ya? 
But these people won't be denied.       Finally...

THE POSTMAN His name is, uh... Richard Starkey. From Maine. He has a saying. 'Things are getting better, getting better all the time.' 
There's warm applause at that.    Several people try the expression out on each other. 
MAN #3 He a Democrat or a Republican? 
THE POSTMAN Parties are over with. The individual is what counts. You vote for the best man. 
Ellen sets a steaming bowl of stew in front of The Postman. Famished, he digs in. 
MAN #4 What about Europe? Any word? 
The Postman tries to speak through a mouthful of food. 
THE POSTMAN Lady Di's in charge. Sixty years old and she still kicks ass. 
WOMAN #3 Is Nathan Holn still alive? 
THE POSTMAN (smiles at irony) He died. Skin cancer. 
That's sure good news to everyone.       But... 
WOMAN #4 And the Holnists? They're still out there. What's the government going to do about them? 
The Postman looks at the desperate faces -- he'd rather get back to his meal -- but this may be the most important question of all. He doesn't want to lie. 
THE POSTMAN The government's just getting started. You're on your own for at least eighteen months.

A clamor of Holnist questions. 
ELLEN Be quiet, everyone! Can't we just let this man eat? 
The people nod and The Postman finally gets to eat. He catches sight of Briscoe watching him from the door. After a moment, Briscoe leaves. 
36   INT. FOSTER'S FREEZE - LATER                                   36 
A band plays an odd array of instruments. There's dancing. The Postman sits behind four empty bowls. People watch him eat like it was a religious experience. He pushes back the fifth bowl. 
THE POSTMAN Never thought I'd hear myself say this, but I can't eat anymore. 
He's cut off by the sight of a silent, little boy.    The kid's looking up, staring intently at something. 
THE POSTMAN What? 
The boy just stares. 
THE POSTMAN (re:   the cap) This? 
The boy nods. The Postman shakes his head and smiles to himself. He takes off the cap, sets it on the kid's head. 
THE POSTMAN Almost fits. 
The boy's eyes go wide with wonder. His stock's gone up 1000%. Before he can rush off to impress his friends, ELLEN -- his mother -- steps over and gently chides him. 
ELLEN That's not a toy, honey. That's very important. Give it back.

The boy carefully removes the cap, hands it back to The Postman. Ellen smiles gratefully and gently guides her son away. 
The Postman shrugs, turns to find Abby, the pretty woman we saw at the Pine View gates. She smiles at The Postman. 
ABBY Would you like to dance? 
THE POSTMAN I don't know if I can, I think I'm still on duty. 
He laughs.    Abby says nothing. 
THE POSTMAN It's been a long time. 
Abby holds out her hand like a promise. 
ABBY All you got to do is hold on. 
DANCE FLOOR 
Abby and The Postman dance.          She keeps looking him over. 
THE POSTMAN Is something wrong? 
ABBY How tall are you? 
THE POSTMAN About six feet. 
ABBY Are you smart? 
THE POSTMAN Smarter than some I guess.       Why? 
ABBY Just wondering. Did you ever have the bad mumps? 
The Postman smiles.    She's odd, but beautiful. 
THE POSTMAN Never had the bad mumps. 
(CONTINUED) 
The Holnist army rides out. Overcome by grief, tied at the wrists, Abby stumbles behind one of the wagons. 
52   EXT. BURNT-OUT POST OFFICE - NIGHT                            52 
Before the smoking ruins, Ford pulls on a blue shirt, his homemade postal flag on the shoulder. As Briscoe steps up, Ford shows him a bundle of singed, but intact letters. 
FORD I managed to save these. 
BRISCOE (re: shirt) Take that thing off, Johnny.    You want to die, too? 
Ford shoves the letters in a makeshift bag, then climbs onto his waiting pony. 
FORD I'm headed south. With the mail. 
BRISCOE (grabs harness) Don't be a damn fool. 
FORD What kind should I be?... Haw! 
Ford digs his heels into the pony and is off in a flash doing damn near a buck seventy-five. 
53   INT. MOVIE THEATER (BENNING, OREGON) - DAY                    53 
Mail call. The Postman stands in front of the torn screen. Hoping for glory by association, the smiling Mayor stands beside him. The ragged people of Benning clamor in front. Kids smile up at him as he calls out names: 
THE POSTMAN Rachel Clark! (as she's there) Charlie Sykes! (as he's there) Graham Druitt! 
VOICE G.D. died last winter of flu. 
The Postman nods, sticks the letter back in his bag. 
THE POSTMAN That's it for now, folks. There'll be more once a real system is in place. 
(CONTINUED) 
53   CONTINUED:                                                      53 
As usual, The Postman is assaulted with questions. 
MAN Tell us about President Starkey! 
WOMAN What about New York City?   Did they survive the plague? 
THE POSTMAN Survive? They got Broadway up and running again. There's a kid doing Andrew Lloyd Webber like you wouldn't believe. 
An older woman sheds a happy tear -- this is wonderful news. 
MAN #3 How much is it to mail a letter? 
THE POSTMAN (smiles) A buck seventy-five. 
MAN #3 That sounds awful cheap. 
THE POSTMAN The catch is the only currency recognized are silver American coins minted before 1964 and two dollar bills. Look for Thomas Jefferson. Of course, food is always acceptable as barter. 
The moment is split by a SIREN. 
54   EXT. BENNING, OREGON - DAY                                      54 
A long double-line of Holnist Cavalry stand in formation in front of the city walls made from stacks of crushed cars. On top, a SKINNY SENTRY CRANKS the SIREN while a CHUBBY SENTRY watches. 
Bethlehem rides through them with Abby in tow -- her wrists tied by a rope which is looped around the pommel of Bethlehem's saddle. Her face is bruised, her bottom lip split. Bethlehem reins up, puzzled by the apparent stall. 
(CONTINUED)

GIBBS (rides up; salutes) They won't open the gates, sir. 
BETHLEHEM What? 
GIBBS They say they got a representative of the restored United States in there. They say this army is illegal. They say -- 
The Chubby Sentry answers from the top of the palisade. 
CHUBBY SENTRY Drop dead and go to hell! 
The Chubby Sentry disappears back behind cover. Bethlehem remains controlled, but his manner becomes deadly. 
BETHLEHEM The Romans had an expression they used to scare their children. 'Hannibal ad portas!' -- Hannibal is at the gates. Do you know who Hannibal was? (as she doesn't answer) Of course not. A pretty girl like you wouldn't know a thing. (to Getty) Colonel Getty, get some men up there and open that gate. 
55   EXT. INSIDE GATES - DAY                                     55 
The Mayor hurries over, The Postman following reluctantly behind. The Mayor spots the Sentries up on the parapet. 
MAYOR What the hell are you doing?! Open the gates! 
SKINNY SENTRY Government's restored! We don't have to take their crap anymore! 
56   EXT. PALISADE GATES (BENNING) - DAY                         56 
Two Holnists scale the gates. They're near the top when the Skinny Sentry appears. He FIRES an ARROW. Hit through the shoulder, one Holnist falls. The other jumps. 
57   EXT. PARAPET - INSIDE WALLS - DAY                               57 
Chubby and Skinny duck down behind the safety of the walls, trading high-fives. 
58   EXT. PALISADE GATES (BENNING) - DAY                             58 
Bethlehem orders his men to pull back. He shakes his head, a quiet rage building. But he knows there's no military threat here. It's going to be a massacre. 
59   EXT. PARAPET - INSIDE WALLS - DAY                               59 
Climbing an inside ladder, the Mayor slams the Chubby Sentry against the wall. 
MAYOR Idiots! 
CITIZEN #1 (realizing; scared) They're gonna kill us all. 
The Mayor peers out through an observation hole.   The Postman and several others join him. 
64   CONTINUED:                                                         64 
The Holnist FIRES first. We don't see the hit. Just watch as The Postman FIRES an answering ROUND. The Holnist goes down. 
The Postman reins up alongside the wagon. Grunting with pain, he reaches down, takes Abby's arm and swings her up behind him. Then digs his heels in for all he's worth. 
More Holnists come on the run. They FIRE. The HORSE SNORTS in pain. He's hit. But The Postman urges him on, heading into the woods. 
Bethlehem snaps off the arrow shaft and shouts: 
BETHLEHEM Colonel Getty! 
65   EXT. WOODLAND ROAD - DAY                                           65 
Abby is concerned as the horse slows to a trot. 
ABBY We can't stop now. They'll be coming after us. 
The Postman's head lolls forward. She feels something on her hand, pulls it back smeared with blood. The Postman's shot in the belly. 
The horse is failing.       Near death. 
We hear the sound of PURSUING CAVALRY. Abby urges the horse off the road. When the thicket grows too dense, Abby jumps down. She catches The Postman as he slides off, easing him to the ground. 
THE POSTMAN (disoriented) Abby... 
Abby shushes him. She pulls on the horse's bridle to force him farther along. But it's no good, the wounded horse goes down on its knees. 
And five RIDERS THUNDER past.       Fooled.   All but the SIXTH, who pulls up to listen. 
In the deep b.g., flames lick at the billowing black smoke. The town is burning. 
The HORSE WHINNIES: in its death throes.        Abby panics, tries to quiet the horse.

The Sixth Soldier has heard the suffering horse. He draws his rifle from the saddle boot and starts into the thicket. 
ON ABBY AND POSTMAN 
The Postman lies unconscious on the ground. Abby sits beside him, rifle in hand. The Sixth Soldier appears. 
ABBY Don't move. 
He hesitates at first. Then dismounts and moves toward her. Abby cocks the rifle. 
SIXTH SOLDIER If you'd had a bullet, you'd a used it by now. 
Moving closer still, he doesn't see the BRANCH pulled back in The Postman's hand until it SNAPS hard into his face. 
He stumbles back. 
ABBY You're right. 
Abby dashes out, rifle in hand. She swings for the bleachers. The butt catches the side of the Sixth Soldier's head. He falls hard. 
The Postman's eyes flutter. Dazed, he watches as Abby pilfers through the Soldier's gear. She takes everything of value: a knife, bullets, a canteen. His eyes flutter closed. 
66   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                              66 
Snowflakes swirl. Abby lays a sapling travois beside The Postman. He groans as she rolls him onto it, tucks a blanket around him. Using all the strength God gave her, Abby lifts one end, gets it high enough to hitch it to the Sixth Soldier's horse. As Abby leads the horse away... 
67   EXT. WOOD ROAD - DAY                                          67 
The snow has increased. A Holnist patrol moves down the road, disappears around a bend. A beat.

67   CONTINUED:                                                       67 
Abby appears, leading the horse and travois.   She crosses the road and disappears into the woods. 
A moment later, she reappears with a pine branch which she uses to brush at the snow, obscuring their tracks. 
68   EXT. CASCADE MOUNTAINS (OREGON) - DAY                            68 
Riding into a blizzard, Abby leads the way up a zigzag path. A valley opens up below. The unconscious Postman lies bundled on the travois. 
69   EXT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                        69 
A little square shape just visible beyond a creek.     Abby leads the horse and travois-bound Postman to it. 
70   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                        70 
One room. Dirt floor. The WINDOWS RATTLE in the WIND. Snow falls through a hole in the roof. The wooden DOOR BURSTS back and Abby enters. Half-frozen, she leads the horse and the travois right inside. 
71   INT. HUNTING SHACK - NIGHT                                       71 
A fire has been lit. 
The Postman lies unconscious, his shirt open as Abby washes around his wound. She pulls the shirt back to clean his chest. The material falls away and Abby stops short. There -- high on his biceps -- a branded "8." She stares in disbelief.

72   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                         72 
The Postman lies on a cot below the window.    He's conscious, but pale as a ghost. 
Abby brings him a bowl of soup. Very thin soup.       Stirring it with a spoon, The Postman smiles at Abby. 
THE POSTMAN Thank you. 
She turns her back on him without a word.   The Postman tries an exchange just the same.

72   CONTINUED:                                                      72 
Abby starts putting on layer after layer of clothing. 
ABBY I'm going to check the pass. 
THE POSTMAN Why are you in such a hurry to get out of here? I can think of worse places. And worse company to -- 
And with the SLAM of the DOOR she is gone.

A few flakes of snow have begun to drift down. The Postman sits at the window -- starts to play tic-tac-toe in the frost. But then it dawns on him: 
THE POSTMAN You can't play tic-tac-toe with yourself. 
79   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                                 79 
Disoriented, Abby stops to take stock of her surround- ings. But she can't make anything out -- the snowfall is too thick. 
80   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                         80 
The fire is dying. The food untouched. The Postman sits in bed staring anxiously out the window. The snow has turned into a blizzard. He runs Abby's red ribbon through his hands. 
81   EXT. WOODS - DAY                                             81 
Abby trudges along heavily. She stumbles as the ice covering the stream breaks beneath her feet. 
ABBY Help! 
82   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                     82 
The Postman hears her call. 
83   EXT. HUNTING SHACK - DAY                                     83 
The door opens and out steps The Postman. In pain, he staggers around the back of the cabin -- in search of her. 
84   EXT. STREAM - DAY                                            84 
Abby looks up, sees him coming. The Postman collapses across from her. Both prone, they're also nearly nose-to- nose. 
THE POSTMAN I can't help you. 
Finally, he pulls himself to his knees. She does the same. They climb each other to a standing position. Arm- in-arm, they start for the cabin. 
85   INT. HUNTING SHACK - DUSK                                    85 
Abby sits huddled in blankets. The fire is blazing. The Postman steps over, sets the once-again-hot bowl of stew before her. 
She considers the food a moment. 
ABBY I told you that's all there was. 
THE POSTMAN That's why you should have it. 
ABBY I knew you could walk. 
THE POSTMAN You're weird, you know that? 
86   INT. HUNTING SHACK - NIGHT                                    86 
The Postman lies in bed, stares through the hole in the roof. A full moon is on the rise. Abby lies in her own makeshift bed, also awake. After a long silence: 
THE POSTMAN We walked on the moon once, Abby. 
ABBY So?    What good is that now? 
THE POSTMAN Obviously you've forgotten Tang and microwave ovens. (a beat) Your face looks pretty. 
Abby looks up. 
THE POSTMAN Not so bruised. 
ABBY Look, there's something you'd better know. You're going to find out soon enough. I'm pregnant. (a long beat) It's Michael's baby. You're just the body father. 
THE POSTMAN How do you know it's mine and not Bethlehem's? 
ABBY He tried with me almost every night. He couldn't do it. So he beat me. Said it was my fault.

Then, he catches his reflection in the water.       Tangled beard. Matted hair. Is that him? 
He suddenly starts sharpening the knife with renewed vigor. We get a sense he's not going to use it on the fish. 
HANDS 
plunge into the water, pull splashfuls up. We START ON The Postman's back, then ARC AROUND as he washes his face. He's just finished shaving off his beard with the hunting knife. He's nicked-up, but it's a definite improvement and he smiles in satisfaction -- until he sees -- 
Abby, reflected in the water. 
THE POSTMAN Abby. 
The Postman whips around to see her standing there.

They come around the corner to where seven young recruits wait. They're joined by another twenty carriers. 
FORD More recruits? 
RED Seven of them. They're coming from everywhere. 
Ford looks them over in satisfaction. 
CHUBBY Did you get a letter or didn't you? 
Ford smiles, reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a creased sheet of paper. Chubby grins. 
FORD Gather 'round, everybody. Got another letter here. Came in last night. 
Buzzing with excitement, the carriers gather around Ford. 
SOUTH END OF BOULEVARD 
Ponytail leads Abby and The Postman. They come up in the back of the crowd. Flanked by Red and Chubby, Ford stands on the hood of a car, letter in hand. The Postman taps a clueless YOUNG CARRIER on the back. 
THE POSTMAN What's all this? 
YOUNG CARRIER Postman sent Ford another letter. He's gonna read it. 
FORD (reading) 'Hello, all postal carriers.' 
CARRIERS (a ritual) Hello!

FORD I'm here in Minneapolis with President Starkey, but my thoughts are with you. Remember, nothing worth doing can be done overnight. Keep your chins up and do your best not to get shot. Signed, The Postman. 
A buzz goes through the crowd.       Ponytail looks over. 
PONYTAIL His letters are always kind of short. 
Abby and The Postman exchange a look. 
FORD (looks up) Hold on now. There's a P.S... Anybody know what P.S. stands for? 
The Postman raises his hand. Ford looks his way. His mouth drops as he realizes. In silence, he walks over to The Postman. They embrace and all the weight Ford's been carrying on his young shoulders suddenly falls to The Postman. The kid nearly collapses. 
CHUBBY Holy shit... 
RED That would be H.S., Chubby. 
CHUBBY I seen him once when I lived in Benning. It's The Postman! 
Word goes through the crowd like a wave. 
The Postman takes the letter, reads. 
THE POSTMAN P.S.   Ford knows what to do. 
Ford shrugs sheepishly. 
FORD Guess you want to talk about this? 
The Postman takes Ford by the elbow. They disappear into the tent. The carriers just staring after them, awestruck.

The Postman and Ford. 
THE POSTMAN President Starkey? Minneapolis? Ford knows what to do? 
FORD I thought you were dead. 
THE POSTMAN So? I'm not making the connection. What's all this then? 
FORD I lied. I told people you were in contact with me. 
THE POSTMAN Why? 
FORD Because I didn't want it to end. 
THE POSTMAN I don't know how long I can stay, Ford. President Starkey will send word one day and I'll have to move on. Understand? 
FORD Sure. But you'll stay till he sends word? Right? 
The Postman can't answer, just turns and walks out of the tent. 
93   EXT. TENT - DAY                                                 93 
As The Postman exits, Chubby leads the carriers in a salute. The Postman actually turns a moment to see if someone else is standing behind him. 
He looks back, sees the young, shining faces.

THE POSTMAN Aw, don't do that. Hands down. 
Their hands go down in one crisp military move. The Postman looks at Abby, to Ford as he exits the tent.         The kid is craving reassurance. 
Realizing, Bethlehem turns the face from side-to-side. 
BETHLEHEM Who the hell are you? 
CARRIER (PRISONER) Carrier Twelve. United States, um, Postal Service. 
Getty sets some of the Carrier's anti-Holnist propaganda onto Bethlehem's field table. Bethlehem picks it up. 
It's hard to say what he's thinking.      Finally: 
BETHLEHEM I want the camp struck at dawn. We're moving north. 
GIBBS Yes, sir. 
Bethlehem looks back to Carrier Twelve. 
BETHLEHEM (chilling) You spelled tyranny wrong. 
100   EXT. RV CAMP - DAWN                                           100 
Ten letter carriers are on horseback. Among them, Red and Ponytail. Ford and The Postman are also on horses. Each rider salutes The Postman, then gets a sheaf of anti- Holnist propaganda from Ford. 
THE POSTMAN I wish they'd stop saluting. 
It's annoying him. As Chubby rides up. The Postman catches his right wrist as he attempts to salute. So Chubby salutes with the left hand instead. As they line up: 
THE POSTMAN Just stay safe and remember. The mailman's more important than the mail. 
CHUBBY Boy, he's smart. 
The sun just peeks up over the horizon. At that signal, the carriers thunder off, the ground trembling under them. The look on their faces. The glory of it all. They're alive! The Postman hesitates, watches after them a moment. 
THE POSTMAN What the hell? 
Urging his horse forward, he rides after them. With them. And then, like an exploding firework, each postman shoots off in a separate direction. Headed for all points of the compass and some in between. 
101   EXT. OREGON HAMLET - DAY                                      101 
The Postman looks down on the gathered crowd from his horse and smiles. 
THE POSTMAN For President Starkey and the First Congress of the Restored United States, I officially declare Postal Station 10... What's the name of this town? 
YOUNG LEADER We never named it. 
THE POSTMAN (thinks; smiles) I officially declare Postal Station 10 in Elvis, Oregon, open for business! 
102   EXT. TOWN (SOMEWHERE IN OREGON) - DAY                         102 
An eye-blink of a town. Ponytail stands on a crate reading names and handing letters to the grateful people massed around her. 
103   EXT. TOWN (IDAHO BORDER) - DAY                                103

104   EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT                                          104 
The moon hangs low over an interstate. A rider is silhouetted by the silvery orb, looking like some post- apocalyptic Don Quixote. It's The Postman. 
105   EXT. FARMHOUSE/COUNTRY ROAD - DAY                             105 
Seen FROM the porch, a rider gallops hard on the road beyond. 
A LITTLE BOY comes rushing out, letter in hand. The boy pulls up short; realizes the rider is already too far gone. The boy's shoulders sag; he's crushed. 
LITTLE BOY I missed him. 
It's an almost psychic moment as the rider reins up in the distance and turns back around. A frozen beat and he starts galloping back down the road. 
Fearless, the boy holds out the letter. The rider closes; it's The Postman. The boy stretches out as far as he can. Without breaking stride, The Postman leans out of the saddle, snatches the letter as he passes. 
The boy watches after him -- knows what he's going to be when he grows up. 
106   EXT. PINE VIEW GATES - DAY                                    106 
Sheriff Briscoe huffs and puffs his big frame up the ladder and onto the top of the palisade. 
BRISCOE Phil, this better not be another of your U.F.O.'s. 
He looks where the sentry points. The Postman waits at the gate, behind him on horseback: Ford and Abby.

THE POSTMAN I'm back!   And I got mail. 
BRISCOE (amazed) I'll be damned. 
107   EXT. PINE VIEW STREETS - DAY                                    107 
The Postman rides with Briscoe, hurrying to stay alongside him. Half the town jogs along behind them. 
FORD Bethlehem is offering a 1000 pounds of gold to whoever brings you in. Dead or alive. 
THE POSTMAN Thank God it wasn't a carton of cigarettes. 
BRISCOE I'd have shot you myself. 
108   EXT. PINE VIEW STREETS - NIGHT                                  108 
Pine View is throwing a party. It's in full swing. A couple of guitars. A banjo and a trombone. Everyone dances. 
The Postman walks with Briscoe, sees Mrs. March as her letter is read to her. Catches a glimpse of Abby dancing with Ford. He seems, for the first time, truly happy. For that matter, so does Briscoe. 
BRISCOE Things are getting better. Getting better all the time. (a beat) I don't know who you are, but I do know I was wrong about you. 
The Postman smiles, reaches in his bag for an envelope. 
THE POSTMAN Got a letter for you, Sheriff. 
THE POSTMAN That makes five. All on Southern routes. 
112   EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY                                        112 
Five dead mail carriers have been laid out on the asphalt. Bethlehem walks the line, looking for his elusive arch- enemy. 
BETHLEHEM No.  No. Not him. No. (looks to soldiers) Children. I want a man and you bring me children! 
113   EXT. OREGON ROAD - DAY                                       113 
A beautiful day. Ponytail rounds a bend at a lope -- and then -- her eyes widen in terror. She jerks the reins; the horse rears in protest. 
Ahead: the truck stop. The five mail carriers hang upside down from the roof's overhang. A macabre sight. 
POV THROUGH RIFLE SCOPE 
SIGHTING ON Ponytail. A hand comes INTO FRAME and brings the rifle barrel down. It's -- 
GIBBS AND HOLNIST SHARPSHOOTER 
GIBBS Not yet. General wants the message to get back. 
114   EXT. RV. CAMP - NIGHT                                        114 
PAN UP FROM The Postman's dusty boots TO his grimly determined face as he strides through camp and stops at Old George's trailer. 
He moves OUT OF FRAME, revealing -- Abby and Ponytail in the b.g. 
115   INT. OLD GEORGE'S TRAILER - NIGHT                               115 
As usual, Old George is hunkered down before his short wave. He looks as the door opens and The Postman enters. 
THE POSTMAN Tell me about the other stuff you know... 
George crosses the trailer, opens a cabinet. Inside: twenty odd guns plus the parts for several more. The CROW CAWS. 
116   EXT. ELVIS, OREGON - DAY                                        116 
Quiet. An old flag ruffles outside the post office -- the only new structure in town. Old George sweeps the porch as a patrol of ten Holnist soldiers ride into town. George makes no move to flee as they near. As they rein up across from him he just smiles and continues sweeping. 
Sensing it, the Holnist officer looks up. There, on the roof, stands The Postman. Ford and Briscoe flank him -- along with twenty mailmen and locals, armed with guns, bows and rocks. 
As the soldiers raise their rifles, the roofies OPEN FIRE. George whips up a sawed-off SHOTGUN. BOOM! Caught in the storm, the ten soldiers go down. 
Grim, The Postman looks to Ford as the locals cheer. George resumes sweeping. The mailmen climb down to strip the weapons off the dead. 
THE POSTMAN Ford, I want you to get rid of the bodies. I don't want these people blamed for what we did. 
Ford nods. 
117   EXT. HOLNIST ARMY CAMP - NIGHT                                  117 
Two sentries guard the east. They peer into the gloom at the sound of a WAGON APPROACHING. It sounds like it's coming fast. 
SENTRY Halt!   Identify yourself!

WAGON 
tearing along. Ford at the reins, urging the horses to all possible speed.  Then he stands, leaps to the ground. 
SENTRIES 
They raise their rifles as the riderless wagon looms out of the night. They each get off a SHOT before being forced to dive out of the way. The wagon continues on, down to... 
HOLNIST CAMP 
A soldier finally grabs hold of one of the halters and brings the wagon to a stop. Half-dressed, Bethlehem steps up. A tarp covers the back upon which is written... 
BETHLEHEM (reading) Postage due... 
Bethlehem yanks away the tarp to reveal the 10 dead Holnist soldiers. The men around Bethlehem exchange looks, can't believe it. Bethlehem bellows in rage. 
118   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                             118 
Ford, hidden in the woods, smiles at the sound. 
119   EXT. HOLNIST CAMP - NIGHT                                      119 
Bethlehem steps forward and shouts his challenge into the night. 
BETHLEHEM You want a war? I'll give you a war. I was born for it! 
120   EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                             120 
Bethlehem's words reach Ford, his smile fades. He's just a scared boy. He kicks his horse into a gallop and rides away. 
CUT TO: 
121   EXT. SMALL AIRFIELD - DAY                                    121 
In the fog, the sound of hollow HOOF BEATS. The Postman rides past the shapes of airplanes. Standing silent. Forever grounded. The ghosts of the past. 
122   EXT. RV CAMP - DAY                                           122 
Ford is swearing in four new recruits. 
ON FORD AND RECRUITS 
As they repeat after him we realize they've changed the oath a bit. 
FORD/RECRUITS Neither snow, nor heat, nor gloom of night. Through bandit's hell, through fire fight. Through flood and plague we cannot fail. No Holnist trash will stop the mail. 
THE POSTMAN 
riding his weary mount into town, saddlebags bulging with mail. He pauses by the new recruits long enough to hear the words they're saying. 
BETHLEHEM You think you can ride? (as the Carrier nods) Then today's your lucky day. 
124   INT. RV PARK - AIRSTREAM - DAY                                  124

Ford and Chubby watch and wait as The Postman goes to the boy's side. 
BLOODIED CARRIER Bethlehem says... 
The Postman motions it's okay as the Carrier struggles. 
BLOODIED CARRIER ... he's... headed north. He's gonna kill ten people in every town. Then burn it to the ground. For what you did... 
The Postman is puzzled.    But Ford knows what and why. 
BLOODIED CARRIER He said to tell you Pine View's on his way. He said he'd wait there, but not for long. (breaking down) I was so scared, sir... I thought they were going to kill me, too... I wish they would have... 
125   EXT. RISE ABOVE PINE VIEW - DAY                                  125 
The Postman poised on a rise that affords a view of the gruesome spectacle below. 
POSTMAN'S POV 
Pine View in flames. The big John Deere gun has blown several gaps into the palisade. Bethlehem watches as his army sacks the town. The people have been rounded up. The selection of the ten has begun. 
126   EXT. RISE ABOVE PINE VIEW - DAY                                  126 
The Postman wheels his horse around. But Ford, Ponytail, Chubby and Luke are standing in his way. 
FORD What are you going to do? 
THE POSTMAN I'm going to stop this. 
FORD You can't.

THE POSTMAN Get out of my way, Ford. All of you. 
FORD (shaking his head) They'll kill you. 
The Postman starts to ride through them.      Luke, Chubby and Ponytail move their horses to block. 
Ford maneuvers his horse in close and grabs The Postman's harness. 
THE POSTMAN Goddamnit -- 
The Postman jumps off his horse. Ford tackles him. The Postman shoves him away, continues on. Luke and Chubby pounce on him. With Ford's help, they hold him down. 
FORD You can't help them! 
THE POSTMAN There's still time, Ford! 
The Postman struggles.      They're genuinely having trouble holding him down. 
PONYTAIL (re: The Postman) You're hurting him. 
But there's no let-up. 
FORD No, this is all my doing.    I went against your orders. 
There's a moment of shocked surprise. 
FORD The Holnists we killed. You told me to bury them. But I didn't. I sent Bethlehem the bodies. 
THE POSTMAN Why? 
FORD Because Bethlehem has to know that we're not going to stop.

THE POSTMAN God damn you, Ford. Those people down there are dying because of us. Because of what we did. 
FORD Bullshit. They're dying because of Bethlehem. They're dying because this is a shitty world. And if we're ever going to change it, then somebody might have to die. If I could make it be me down there I would. But I can't. 
A terrible SCREAM gives them all pause. 
127   EXT. PINE VIEW - DAY                                             127 
Down below -- Holnist soldiers hold back a screaming mother as her 10-year-old boy is pulled into the line. 
Sheriff Briscoe is among the ten, he puts his hand on the boy's shoulder -- the picture of grace under pressure.

A moment of stunned silence. 
PONYTAIL What Ford did was wrong. But it doesn't change anything for any of us. Does it? 
(CONTINUED) 
FORD Who's the other letter to? 
THE POSTMAN Bethlehem. I'm taking it to him in the morning. 
FORD What does it say? 
THE POSTMAN Mail's private. You know that. 
FORD What does it say? 
THE POSTMAN (stops; turns) It says it's over. It says we quit.

FORD It says you quit. What about the oath? 
THE POSTMAN Tell me something, Ford. How much mail can a dead postman deliver? It's over. 
The Postman starts to walk away again. 
FORD Then I'll take it. 
THE POSTMAN I can't trust you. 
Ford gathers courage and confronts The Postman. 
FORD If this is the end. If this is the last piece of mail that ever gets delivered. I'll take it. 
THE POSTMAN Whoever takes this letter probably dies for it. 
Ford thrusts out his hand. 
FORD I'm still a postman. You owe it to me... I owe it to me. 
The Postman hesitates, studies the intense young man. Gives him the letter. 
138   EXT. R.V. CAMP - STABLE AREA - DAY                               138 
The Postman is packing bags onto a horse as Abby approaches. 
THE POSTMAN I'm going to St. Rose, Abby. And I'm taking you with me. I know you don't want to hear it, but that's my child inside you. I want to see it born somewhere safe. I have a right to that, Abby. Whether you like it or not. 
Abby walks away. The Postman rests his head on his pack for a moment. Heavy.

The CLICK of a GUN causes The Postman to lift his head and see Luke standing there. 
THE POSTMAN Thought I recognized you. 
LUKE General Bethlehem said... (raises the pistol) ... You should be on your knees when I do it. 
THE POSTMAN I don't give a damn what that asshole said. 
LUKE The general is a great man. 
THE POSTMAN The general is a fucking lunatic. 
The Postman steps forward. Stops when the barrel of the pistol is right against his own chest. 
THE POSTMAN You don't own a thought in that goddamn head of yours, do you? (a beat) You want to see a man? 
The Postman turns to watch as Ford starts out of camp. 
THE POSTMAN That's a man. 
The Postman turns, sees Luke's face fraught with confusion and emotion. 
THE POSTMAN You don't understand, do you? You never will until you can think for yourself and be willing to pay the price for it. 
Luke stares back into The Postman's eyes.      A frozen beat. 
THE POSTMAN You ready? 
ABBY (O.S.) Yes.

Some carriers drop their uniforms into a bonfire. 
The Postman and Abby ride up on the ridge above the RV camp. They pause to look back one last time. Across the way, on the other side, Ford is doing the same thing. As though he senses it, Ford stops and looks back. 
Ford raises his hand, salutes. Slowly, The Postman brings up his own hand. But he doesn't salute. He waves. Good- bye. As Ford turns away, so does The Postman.

A sign prohibits pedestrians, horses and bicycles. The Postman and Abby ride by. The Postman no longer wears his uniform. Their gear is packed behind their saddles. 
As a family of transients begin to rise from where they're camped in the breakdown lane: 
THE POSTMAN We can't help you. We're just as lost as you are. 
A wild-haired SQUATTER steps out on the porch as Abby and The Postman ride by. He waves hello with a .45. 
SQUATTER Howdy. Welcome to sunny California. 
THE POSTMAN (re: the town) What happened here? 
SQUATTER Little accident. The ground started to shake big time and the Hanford nuclear plant went... (motions an explosion) ... 'Poof.' Destroyed everything for miles. But the sunsets are beautiful. 
THE POSTMAN You ever hear of a city called St. Rose? 
SQUATTER Friend, I've never heard of St. Shit. 
The Squatter laughs and laughs -- like it was the funniest thing in the world. The Postman and Abby exchange a look, continue on their way. 
SQUATTER Hey, don't go! I got Monopoly in the house! Boardwalk, Park Place and the Reading Railroad!

The useless towers cutting across a valley.      Rain beats down, as The Postman and Abby trudge along. 
Up ahead, a rail-road tunnel promises shelter from the storm. 
THE POSTMAN (re: the tunnel) We can rest in there. 
Abby is quick to agree. 
Out of the corner of his eye, The Postman catches a blur of movement. 
He turns his head quickly, but he's barely in time to see a wooden basket, attached to one of the high wires, swing from a distant tower. There's a sentry inside it. 
The basketed sentry whistles away at 40 mph, heading straight for an adjacent tower. In a matter of seconds, he's lost from view. 
The Postman looks back at Abby.       She's shivering. 
THE POSTMAN Did you see that? 
ABBY (shaking her head) I'm hungry, Postman. 
The Postman guides her toward the train tunnel.

A town settled between spans of a steel truss bridge. The Columbia River rushes far below. A sentry spots Abby and The Postman approaching, blows a whistle. 
GUARD Set the rifle on the ground. 
THE POSTMAN This old thing? It isn't even loaded. Where are we? 
The BRIDGE CITY MAYOR, a middle-aged retro-hippie, steps up. 
B.C. MAYOR You're in Bridge City. Where we don't allow guns. 
The Postman sets down the carbine.    The Guard steps over to scoop it up. 
B.C. MAYOR Sentry said you were coming. 
The Postman stares at the Mayor a beat. 
THE POSTMAN I know you.     You're famous. 
B.C. MAYOR I was once. Not anymore. (beat) Are you looking to cross?

As they stand, show themselves. 
THE POSTMAN Yes.

The Postman and Abby gasp as the Mayor opens the lid to reveal: 20 well-oiled rifles and 15 pistols with ammo. The Postman blinks over at the Mayor. 
B.C. MAYOR Fact that we don't allow 'em doesn't mean we don't have 'em. We're not stupid, after all. 
THE POSTMAN I'm sorry I've brought this on you. 
B.C. MAYOR No need to be sorry. Long as we get our mail on time. 
PONYTAIL (O.S.) Ready for duty, sir. 
The Postman looks over to see Ponytail, Drew and Chubby ride up. Like him, they are back in uniform.

The Mayor is in the b.g. helping one of the sentries prepare the basket for travel. 
ABBY This is hard for me. (beat) Michael was the best man I ever knew. I never thought there'd be another man I could love the way I loved him. (searching for the words) I don't know why I've been so blessed. And I've tried to find a way to be thankful, but I swear, if I lose you... 
Her eyes start to tear and he takes her in his arms.

He starts to speak.    She stops him, taking his hand. 
ABBY When you come back, we'll be waiting here for you. So you can take us to St. Rose. 
The Postman lets go of her hand and starts for the basket. 
The Mayor gestures to the line of towers extending into the distance. 
B.C. MAYOR There's three good-sized towns up that way. Enough folks to be a big help to you. If you can convince them to come. 
As The Postman steps into the basket, he makes the mistake of looking over the edge. It's a long, long way down. 
B.C. MAYOR A lot higher than it looks, huh? 
The Postman looks at the contraption with more than a little trepidation. The Mayor grins. 
B.C. MAYOR Don't tell anybody, but I like to ride the damn thing just for the hell of it. Being a city official has its perks. 
He winks and as he reaches for the release pin.     The Postman's hand meets his there.

Bethlehem and The Postman riding toward each other. They meet when The Postman is almost three-quarters of the way over to the Holnists' side. 
BETHLEHEM AND POSTMAN 
As they come face-to-face. 
BETHLEHEM My little shipping clerk. 
THE POSTMAN We're both a couple of frauds. You know it; I know it. 
Bethlehem sneers. 
BETHLEHEM Great men are made by other great men. Patton had Rommel. Grant had Lee. But I get you. 
THE   POSTMAN You're no fucking   general. You're a copying machine   salesman. You're not even a   good painter. 
BETHLEHEM Are you trying to goad me into a fight? 
THE POSTMAN Wouldn't it be great if wars could be fought just by the assholes who started them? We could settle this thing right here. You and me. 
BETHLEHEM Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. 
THE POSTMAN It does in your army. 
The Postman kicks his horse up into a gallop, and rides up the Holnist line. No one, least of all Bethlehem, is sure what's going on. 
THE POSTMAN I invoke law seven of the Laws of Eight! Any man may challenge for leadership of the clan!

BETHLEHEM What? 
The Postman wheels his horse around. 
THE POSTMAN I challenge you. 
Bethlehem is caught completely by surprise, but recovers. 
BETHLEHEM You're not a Holnist. You're not a member of the clan. You don't have the right. 
The Postman rolls up his sleeve. He rides the Holnist lines displaying his brand for all to see. The Holnists murmur amongst themselves. 
THE POSTMAN I have every right. I invoke law seven! 
Bethlehem can't believe his eyes. 
THE POSTMAN I challenge for leadership of the clan! 
The seed of doubt is planted. Is Bethlehem violating one of the Laws of Eight? The men look at one another. Gibbs looks to Getty. Bethlehem looks from The Postman's tattoo to his face. 
BETHLEHEM Where do I know you from? 
THE POSTMAN 'Cry Havoc! And let slip the dogs of war.' Remember that? 
BETHLEHEM Shakespeare. The one who didn't want to fight. 
THE POSTMAN I should've found a way to kill you then. But you seemed so strong. 
BETHLEHEM Law seven it is. (to all) This war is settled here! 
(CONTINUED)

As The Postman nods in agreement. 
They take their positions -- and without a word -- they kick their horses into a charge. Coming straight for each other like medieval jousters. 
Bethlehem reaches for his sword.    But before it clears the scabbard, The Postman lunges. 
The horses collide.    Bethlehem and The Postman hit the ground hard. 
Holnists and Carriers alike begin to move forward for a better look. 
The fight is fierce. Bloody. The Postman and Bethlehem are at each other like coiled snakes. 
It's more of a fight than any of the Holnists -- especially Getty -- expected. The spectators pull in tighter. 
Both combatants have taken a beating -- and still, they fight on -- trading bloody, raw-knuckled punches. 
One of Bethlehem's connects. The Postman loses his footing, hits the ground -- knocking his head on a rock with a resounding CRACK. Dazed, he's slow to rise. 
It's just the moment Bethlehem needs, he straddles the fallen Postman, reaches for his knife with one hand -- grabs The Postman's throat with the other. 
BETHLEHEM I study people. I know your problem. Do you know why you can't fight? 
The Postman can't answer. 
BETHLEHEM You have nothing to fight for. You don't care about anything. You don't value anything. You don't believe in anything. That's what makes me better. 
The Postman grabs Bethlehem's knife-hand -- using all his remaining strength to keep him at bay. 
THE POSTMAN (barely audible) I believe in the United States Postal Service. 
(CONTINUED) 
165   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                 165 
The Postman lets go of Bethlehem's hands, grabs his belt and pulls him over. As they roll to their feet, The Postman club-fists Bethlehem on the side of the head. 
THE POSTMAN Neither snow... (wham!) Nor rain... (wham!) Nor heat... (wham!) Nor gloom of night... (wham!) Will stay this courier from the swift completion of his appointed rounds... 
Bethlehem reels, stumbling back. The Postman pounces on top of him, begins to strangle him. Bethlehem tries to pry the fingers from his throat, but can't. He's going to die. 
The Postman is urged on. By both sides. Holnists. Carriers. Ford. Even Holnist Luke. He looks up at the faces -- and finally lets Bethlehem go. The General gasps for breath. 
As Ponytail and Chubby move forward to untie Ford, The Postman looks to both sides.

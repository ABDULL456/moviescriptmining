MEMENTO - Shooting Script 
FADE IN: 
1    INT. DERELICT HOUSE - DAY <>	1 
A POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH, clasped between finger and thumb: a crude, crime scene flash picture of a MAN'S BODY lying on a decaying wooden floor, a BLOODY MESS where his head should be. 
The image in the photo starts to FADE as we SUPER TITLES. The hand holding the photo suddenly FANS it in a rapid FLAPPING motion, then holds it still. The image fades more, and again the picture is FANNED. 
As TITLES END the image fades to nothing. The hand holding the photo FLAPS it again, then places it at the front of a POLAROID CAMERA. 
The camera SUCKS the blank picture up, then the FLASH BURSTS. 
The Polaroid camera is lowered, revealing the sweaty, heavy- breathing face of LEONARD (mid-30's). There are droplets of blood across his face. Leonard stares, satisfied, at something on the ground in front of him. There is WET BLOOD on his BLUE SHIRT and BEIGE SUIT. His hand opens and catches a HANDGUN which leaps up into his grasp. 
Still staring, he crouches down and pulls a BODY off the floor by the wet hair of its BLOODY HEAD. He slowly inserts the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth should be. 
Leonard FLINCHES. A DEAFENING ROAR as wet red leaps off his face and suit and head, with a SPASM, reassembles itself into the face of TEDDY (40's, moustache) and we-

Close on Leonard's eyes. He rolls them to one side, then turns his head. 
LEONARD (V.O.) So where are you? 
Leonard lifts his head. He is lying on a queen-sized bed. 
LEONARD (cont'd) You're in some motel room.

3    EXT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY <>		   3 
A late model Jaguar bumps across some railroad tracks and approaches a large, clearly abandoned DERELICT BUILDING. Leonard is driving. He wears a BEIGE SUIT and BLUE SHIRT (no blood). Next to him is TEDDY. Leonard stops the car next to a PICKUP TRUCK sitting Outside the derelict building. Leonard kills the engine, staring at the pickup. 
LEONARD Looks like somebody's home. 
Teddy looks from Leonard to the pickup and back. 
TEDDY That thing's been here for years. 
Leonard gets out of the Jaguar and moves to the pickup. He inspects it with a methodical, practiced eye. Teddy follows. 
LEONARD I think you're wrong. These tracks aren't	* more than a few days old. 
Leonard opens the door of the pickup and searches the interior. On the dirty vinyl of the passenger seat he finds	* six BULLETS. Leonard picks two of them up and studies them.	* He drops them onto the dashboard then SHUTS the door.		* 
LEONARD (cont'd) Let's take a look inside. 
Leonard walks towards the house, patting his jacket pockets. Teddy leans on the pickup, uneasy, watching Leonard. 
4    INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY <>			4 
Leonard stands in the dimly-lit, decaying former hallway. He pulls a stack of POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS out of his pocket and leafs through them as Teddy starts walking towards him. 
Leonard finds a photo showing Teddy with a shit-eating grin standing in front of the pickup truck. On the broad white strip beneath the photo is handwritten: 
"TEDDY GAMMELL TEL. 555 0134" 
Leonard flips the photo over. On the white strip on the back, in the same small handwriting.

"HE IS THE ONE" 
"KILL HIM" 
LEONARD (V.0.)			* I've finally found him. How long have I		* been looking?					* 
Leonard stuffs the Polaroids back into his pocket, reaches around to the back of his waistband and draws a HANDGUN, keeping it out of Teddy's line of sight. Teddy enters, wary. 
TEDDY Find anything? Didn't think so, let's go, yeah? 
Leonard neither replies nor turns around. Teddy, worried, affects a casual air, shrugging dismissively, 
TEDDY (cont'd) Fuck this. 
Teddy turns and heads for the door. Leonard LEAPS on him, pistol-whipping him furiously as he shouts: 
LEONARD YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID! YOU BEG FORGIVENESS, THEN YOU PAY! 
Teddy is down. Leonard DRAGS him back, deeper into the dark house. Leonard is in a frenzy. He dumps Teddy at the end of the hall and stands over him. Teddy SPITS BLOOD. 
TEDDY You don't have a clue, you freak. 
Leonard crouches down and grabs Teddy by the lapels. 
LEONARD Beg my forgiveness! Beg my wife's forgiveness before I blow your brains out! 
TEDDY Leonard, you don't have a clue what's going on. You don't even know my name. 
LEONARD (triumphant smile) Teddy!

LEONARD I got a lead on a place. 
Leonard checks the note, then hands it to Teddy. 
TEDDY (surprised at the note) What the hell you want to go there for? 
LEONARD You know it? 
TEDDY Yeah, it's just this fucked-up building.		    * Why are we going there? 
LEONARD (smiling) I don't remember. 
9    EXT. CONTINUOUS - DERELICT BUILDING - DAY <>9 
The Jaguar crosses the railroad tracks and approaches the DERELICT BUILDING. Leonard stops the car next to the PICKUP TRUCK and kills the engine, staring at the pickup. 
LEONARD Looks like somebody's home. 
10   INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE##	   10 
Leonard, wearing BOXERS and PLAID WORK SHIRT, takes the GIDEON BIBLE out off the open bedside table drawer. 
LEONARD (V.0.) Nothing except the Gideon Bible. 
He leafs through a couple off pages, then DROPS the Bible back into the drawer and shuts it. He notices a MESSAGE written on the back off his hand: 
"REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS" 
LEONARD (cont'd) Sammy Jankis had the same problem. He			  * tried writing himself notes. Lots of			   * notes. But he'd get confused. 
Leonard licks his thumb, and rubs at the writing. To Leonard's surprise, IT DOES NOT EVEN SMUDGE. 
He notices his bare legs. There is a NOTE taped to his RIGHT THIGH with a handwritten message:

Leonard pulls the note off, studying it carefully.

Close on the Polaroid of Teddy. Leonard flips it over. On the back are the messages: 
"DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES" 
"HE IS THE ONE" 
Leonard writes another message beneath these two: 
"KILL HIM" 
He sticks the photo of Teddy BETWEEN HIS TEETH as he holds his HANDGUN up and checks that it is loaded. He sticks the GUN in the back of his waistband, the PHOTO in his jacket pocket, slings the POLAROID CAMERA over his shoulder. 
12   EXT. DISCOUNT INN - DAY <>			   12 * 
Leonard leaves room 304 and heads to the office. He pauses just outside the glass door, breathing, psyching himself up. 
13   INT. DISCOUNT INN OFFICE - DAY <>		 13 * 
Leonard enters , confident, smiling at the man behind the desk, BURT (fat, sweaty, 40's). Burt smiles back. 
BURT Hiya. 
LEONARD I'm Mr. Shelby from 304. 
BURT What can I do for you, Leonard? 
LEONARD I'm sorry... um... ? 
BURT Burt. 
LEONARD Burt, I'm not sure, but I may have asked you to hold my calls - (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99

BURT You don't know? 
LEONARD I think I may have. I'm not good on the phone. 
BURT (nods) You said you like to look people in the eye when you talk to them. Don't you remember? 
LEONARD That's the thing. I have this condition. 
BURT Condition? 
LEONARD I have no memory. 
BURT Amnesia? 
LEONARD No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation. So if I seem strange or rude, that's probably... 
He notices that Burt is staring at him as if he were an exotic insect. 
LEONARD (cont'd) I've told you this before, haven't I? 
BURT (nods) I don't mean to mess with you. It's just so weird. You don't remember me at all, and we talked a bunch of times. 
Leonard shrugs. 
Leonard looks down. The waiter hands him a BROWN ENVELOPE and a MOTEL ROOM KEY (DISCOUNT INN, ROOM 304). On the envelope is a handwritten message: 
"FOR LEONARD, FROM NATALIE" 
Leonard looks at his Polaroid photograph of the outside of the Discount Inn motel. There is an address written beneath it (7254 Lincoln Street).							    * 
LEONARD Thanks. Lincoln Street? 
The Waiter glances at his Polaroid. 
WAITER You wanna go east on sixth. (points) Just keep straight, all the way out of town, then take a right.

Leonard drives, consulting his Polaroid photos. 
20   EXT. DISCOUNT INN ROOM 304 - DAY <>	    20 * 
Leonard, BROWN ENVELOPE in hand, finds the door to room 304. 
21   INT. DISCOUNT INN ROOM 304 - DAY <>	    21 * 
Leonard enters, looks around as if for the first time. An anonymous motel room, except that tacked to one wall is a HAND-DRAWN CHART showing the layout of some streets, and stuck to the edges of the chart are POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS, with ARROWS DRAWN from each photograph to a spot on the map. 
Leonard inspects the photos. Some are buildings, some are people. All have the HANDWRITTEN NOTES on the broad white strip underneath the image. 
Leonard gets Polaroids out of his pocket. The first one is of the Discount Inn. He STICKS it onto an already-squashed lump    * of blue tack at the end of an ARROW drawn from a location on the outskirts of town. 
The second photo is a blurred shot of a Brunette turning in a doorway. The name NATALIE is written under the picture. Leonard flips it over. On the back are two handwritten messages. The first one has been completely scribbled over, but the other one reads: 
"SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY" 
Leonard nods, then sticks the photo to the chart. He steps back looking over the Polaroids one by one: Natalie, Burt, Discount Inn, Teddy.							    * 
Leonard sits at the desk and opens the BROWN ENVELOPE. He takes out a photocopy of a CAR REGISTRATION and a DRIVER'S LICENSE. Both are in the name of JOHN EDWARD GAMMELL, but	  * when Leonard looks at the picture on the license, he recognizes the face. Leonard moves back to his wall chart, finds the Polaroid of Teddy and compares it to the license photo. 
LEONARD (V.O.) This guy told me his name was Teddy. 
He turns the photo over and examines the white stop on the back. It says only: 
"DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES"

Leonard smiles. He goes to the phone and dials the number on the Polaroid. A couple of rings, then it's answered. 
TEDDY Yup? 
LEONARD Mr Gammell? 
TEDDY Lenny, is that you? 
LEONARD John Gammell? 
TEDDY Lenny, it's Teddy. Look, stay there, okay? I'm gonna be right over. 
LEONARD I'll be waiting.							   * 
Leonard hangs up, thinking. He looks at the writing on the back of his hand, then pulls back his sleeve to reveal the words: 
"THE FACTS:" 
Leonard removes his jacket, then starts pulling off his shirt. 
He has WRITING TATTOOED ALL OVER HIS CHEST, STOMACH AND ARMS. MESSAGES in different styles of writing, some CRUDE, some ELABORATE. The messages run in all directions, some UPSIDE- DOWN, some BACKWARDS. Leonard examines his tattoos, methodically. From Leonard's POV, the most striking is an upside-down tattoo on his BELLY which says: 
"PHOTOGPAPH: HOUSE, CAR, FRIEND, FOE" 
On one FOREARM it says: 
"THE FACTS: 
FACT 1. MALE 
FACT 2. WHITE" 
On the other FOREARM: 
"FACT 3. FIRST NAME: JOHN OR JAMES 
FACT 4. LASTNAME: G-------"

Leonard pulls down his trousers. On his right THIGH, crudely- lettered: 
"FACT 5. DRUG DEALER" 
And immediately below this, in elegant, neat lettering: 
"FACT 6. CAR LICENSE NUMBER: SG13 7IU"					 * 
Leonard takes out the REGISTRATION DOCUMENT and examines it. Holding the photo of Teddy and the registration document, Leonard checks off his TATTOOED FACTS: 
LEONARD (cont'd) (under his breath) White... male. First name... John. Last name... G for Gammell. Drugs. License			  * plate. (checks document against tattoo on thigh) SG... 13... 7... IU. It's him. It's			    * actually him. 
Leonard looks coldly at Teddy's smiling image. 
LEONARD (cont'd) I found you, you fuck. 
Leonard turns the photo face down, takes a pen and writes: 
LEONARD Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me. 
BURT Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway. 
LEONARD You don't have to be that honest, Burt. 
BURT Leonard. 
Leonard turns. Burt grins. 
BURT (cont'd) Always get a receipt. 
LEONARD I'm gonna write that down. 
Leonard fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket. There is a message on it which he reads. It says: 
"CITY GRILL, MAIN ST. THURSDAY, 1:00PM MEET NATALIE FOR INFO" 
Leonard looks up at Burt. 
LEONARD (cont'd) What time is it? 
35   EXT. ROAD - DAY <>					 35 
The Jaguar speeds along. 36   EXT. THE CITY GRILL ON MAIN STREET - DAY <> 36 
Leonard checks the restaurant name against the note. He gets out his Polaroids, FLIPPING through them until he finds the one of Natalie.

Leonard walks through the restaurant, checking the patrons. He makes eye contact with Natalie, but walks past her table. She sighs and grabs the back of his jacket.

Leonard (in boxers, bandaged arm) SHAVES his thigh, talking	* on the phone. 
LEONARD I'd just become an investigator when I came across Sammy. Mr Samuel R. Jankis - strangest case ever. Guy's 58, semi- retired accountant. He and his wife had been in this car accident... nothing too serious, but he's acting funny - he can't get a handle on what's going on. 
39   INT. A DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE##    39 
A DOCTOR examines SAMMY'S head. SAMMY'S WIFE looks on. 
LEONARD(V.O.) The doctors find some possible damaqe to the hippocampus, nothing conclusive. But Sammy can't remember anything for more than a couple minutes. He can't work, can't do shit, medical bills pile up, his wife calls the insurance company and I get sent in. 
40   INT. JANKIS HOUSE - MESSY SUBURBAN LIVING ROOM - DAY ##BLACK 40 AND WHITE SEQUENCE## 
SAMMY sits smoking, smiling at Leonard (CHEAP SUIT and TIE). 
LEONARD (V.0.) My first big claims investigation - I really check into it. Sammy can think just fine, but he can't make any new memories, he can only remember things for a few minutes. 
Sammy watches a commercial on T.V.

40   CONTINUED:							 40 
LEONARD (V.0.) (CONT'D) He'd watch T.V., but anything longer than a couple of minutes was too confusing, he couldn't remember how it began. He liked commercials. They were short. 
Sammy rolls a small GLASS BOTTLE between the palms of his hands. Mrs. Jankis rolls up her sleeve. Leonard watches as Sammy takes a SYRINGE and pushes the needle through the rubber of the bottle. The label is marked "INSULIN". 
LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd) The crazy part was that this guy who couldn't follow the plot of "Green Acres" could do the most complicated things as long as he had learned them before the accident... 
Sammy INVERTS the bottle and syringe, DRAWS the insulin into the syringe, withdraws the needle, holds it up to check for bubbles, TAPPING it delicately. 
LEONARD (V.0.) (CONT'D) ... and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing. 
Sammy wipes a spot on Mrs. Jankis' arm with a swab, then gently PINCHES the skin and confidently INSERTS the needle.	* Mrs Jankis winces.							 * 
MRS JANKIS						    * Gentle.							  * 
Sammy looks up, worried. Mrs Jankis smiles at him. Sammy pushes * the plunger, withdraws the needle and presses the swab against  * the skin, lookinq into Mrs Jankis' eyes and smiling back.	  * 
41   INT. JANKIS HOUSE FRONT HALL - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE	    41 SEQUENCE## 
Mrs. Jankis opens the front door to Leonard. Leonard shakes hands with Sammy, who smiles at him in apparent recognition. 
LEONARD (V.0.) The doctors assure me that there's a real condition called Korsokoff's syndrome; short-term memory loss, rare but legit. But every time I see him I catch a look of recognition. Just a slight look, but he says he can't remember me at all. (MORE) (CONTINUED)

Leonard's Jaguar pulls up at a red light. Suddenly Teddy is BANGING on the window. 
TEDDY Lenny! I thought you'd gone for good. What brings you back? 
Leonard looks at Teddy, sizing him up. 
LEONARD Unfinished business. What made you think I wasn't coming back? 
TEDDY You said you were leaving town. 
LEONARD (V.O.) Some of the objects were electrified, They'd give him a small shock.

LEONARD They kept repeating the test, always with the same objects electrified. The point was to see if he could learn to avoid the electrified objects. Not by memory, but by instinct. 
50   INT. NATALIE'S BEDROOM: MESSY, CHEAPLY BUT ABUNDANTLY	   50 FURNISHED - MORNING <> 
Leonard opens his eyes, naked in bed. He looks around, confused. With a START, he realizes that someone else is in the bed: a BRUNETTE with her back to him. 
Leonard leans right over her to get a look at her face. It is NATALIE. The BRUISE on her eye and the MARK on her lip are worse than before. 
She OPENS her eyes and is startled by the sight of Leonard's hovering face. 
LEONARD Sorry. It's only me. 
Leonard FLOPS down. Natalie wakes up fully and relaxes. 
NATALIE Sleep okay? 
LEONARD Yeah. You? 
Natalie shrugs. She looks at her bedside clock. (CONTINUED) MEMENTO Blue Revisions - 8/27/99

She gets out of bed, wearing pajamas. Leonard swings his legs out of the bed and realizes that he is wearing trousers and socks. He looks at his tattoos, as if he has never seen them before. 
NATALIE (cont'd) Pretty weird. 
She is smiling at him in the mirror. Leonard smiles, shrugs. 
LEONARD Useful. You never write a phone number on your hand? 
NATALIE							  * (through mirror)						    * I should be able to talk to my friend			  * about the license plate today.				    *

NATALIE							  * (smiles)							  * John G's license plate number. You have			* it tattooed on your thigh.					   * 
Natalie leaves the room. Leonard pulls down his trousers to	* reveal two tattoos:							* 
"FACT 5: DRUG DEALER"							   * 
"FACT 6: LICENSE PLATE NUMBER SG13 1NU"					* 
Leonard runs his finger over fact 6, then pulls his trousers    * up and looks around the room. He spots his suit jacket		* hanging over the back of a chair. He checks the pockets, pulls out his Polaroids, flips through them: a Jaguar, the Discount Inn, Natalie. He flips Natalie's picture over and looks at the back. There are two messages, but the first one has been completely scribbled over. The other one reads: 
"HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE, SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY" 
Leonard stuffs the photos back into his pocket, grabs a white shirt of f the chair and pulls it on. Natalie comes back in and starts to apply her makeup.

Leonard shakes his head and reaches for the note. Natalie grabs his lapel and pulls him down to her, kissing him gently on the mouth. 
NATALIE (cont'd) I think you will. 
LEONARD (smiles) I'm sorry. 
Leonard heads for the door.

Leonard looks around, trying to think. Teddy KNOCKS harder. The Man in the closet BUMPS and GROANS. Leonard reaches into his pocket and pulls out some Polaroids. 
LEONARD (cont'd) Just a minute! 
He finds the one of Teddy, then sticks them back into his pocket. He OPENS the door to Teddy and grins.

Teddy brushes past him into the room.

Teddy SLUMPS into a chair. Leonard tries to smile. There is a faint GRUNTING and BUMPING from inside the closet. Teddy notices the noise and grins. 
TEDDY (cont'd) I get it - amorous neighbors. 
LEONARD Why are you here? 
TEDDY (surprised) You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes. 
Leonard thinks, then moves to the CLOSET and OPENS the door. Teddy looks in DISBELIEF at the Man in the closet. 
TEDDY (cont'd) Who the fuck is that? 
LEONARD You don't know him? 
TEDDY No! Should I? 
Leonard shrugs. 
TEDDY (cont'd) Is this John G.?

TEDDY Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?

DODD (confused) What? 
LEONARD Who did this to you? 
DODD You did. 
Leonard replaces the gag and SHUTS the closet. 
TEDDY I'm not gonna help you kill this guy, if that's what - 
LEONARD No. No, just let me think for a minute. 
Leonard moves to the dresser and starts methodically emptying his pockets. He pulls a Polaroid out of his inside jacket pocket. 
LEONARD (cont'd) Here we go. 
The Polaroid shows Dodd sitting on the bed, BOUND, GAGGED and BLEEDING. The name Dodd is written below the picture. Leonard flips it over. On the back it says: 
"GET RID OF HIM, THEN ASK NATALIE" 
Teddy looks at the photo over Leonard's shoulder. 
TEDDY Natalie? Natalie who? 
LEONARD Why?

LEONARD We can't just walk him out tied up and bleeding. 
TEDDY How'd ya get him in here in the first place? 
LEONARD I don't know. 
Leonard looks around the room for inspiration. 
Leonard hangs up. 
76   INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - DAY <>    76 
Leonard sits on the toilet, grasping an empty VODKA BOTTLE by the neck. He notices the bottle in his hands as if for the first time. 
LEONARD (V.O.) Don't feel drunk. 
Leonard looks up from the VODKA BOTTLE, sighs, rubs his face, then stands up. He SNIFFS at his armpit. 
He puts the empty bottle on the counter by the sink, then wearily UNDRESSES. 
Leonard, NAKED, looks in the mirror, then RUNS THE SHOWER then steps under it, shutting the PEBBLED PLASTIC STALL DOOR. 
Leonard SHOWERS. He turns the water off, then hears the DOOR BEING UNLOCKED. Leonard freezes, standing in the SHOWER STALL, NAKED and DRIPPING. Through the distortion of the PEBBLED PLASTIC DOOR, Leonard sees a FIGURE enter the bathroom and start pissing into the toilet. The distorted Figure turns and approaches the shower stall, becoming clearer as it gets closer, then YANKS the door open. It is Dodd (WITHOUT INJURIES). He is SHOCKED to see the naked Leonard. Leonard BURSTS out of the shower stall, SMASHING Dodd against the wall. 
Dodd STRUGGLES around, grabbing at the SLIPPERY, naked Leonard. Dodd PUSHES against Leonard, SLASMMING him into the sink. 
Leonard has his arms around Dodd's neck. Leonard SMASHES Dodd's head sideways into the wall, HARD. 
Dodd SLUMPS to the floor. Leonard exhales. Dodd puts a FIST in Leonard's crotch, then GRABS his neck as he doubles over. Dodd uses Leonard to pull himself off the floor then PUNCHES the side of his head and pushes him HARD, Leonard FLAILING wildly, GRABBING THE EMPTY VODKA BOTTLE from by the sink as he falls back into the bedroom. Dodd reaches into his INSIDE POCKET. 
77   INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY <>		   77 
Leonard STUMBLES in, naked, from the bathroom, swings around, HITTING Dodd square in the face with the empty vodka bottle, which does not break. 
Dodd lies still on the floor, bleeding, his hand still in his inside jacket pocket. Leonard stands above him, naked, dripping wet, catching his breath. 
There is a KNOCK at the door. 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Housekeeping.

LEONARD Not just now! 
Leonard listens to the maid withdraw her key. Leonard SEARCHES Dodd, finding his GUN in his inside pocket. Leonard examines the weapon, then starts to search the room. Leonard finds an overnight bag at the bottom of the closet. Inside it there are some clothes, spare ammunition, a large hunting knife, and a roll of SILVER ELECTRICAL TAPE. 
Leonard WRAPS the electrical tape around Dodd's wrists, then across his mouth. Leonard finishes taping up Dodd, then sits him on the edge of the bed. Leonard takes a POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of the bloody, taped-up Dodd. 
Leonard shoves Dodd into the closet, takes out a NOTE and consults it, then writes "DODD" on the white strip on the front of the photograph. He flips the picture over and writes on the strip on the back, in smaller writing: 
"GET RID OF HIM, ASK NATALIE" 
Leonard dresses, puts the Polaroid into the inside pocket of his jacket. He looks again at the note. It says: 
"DODD, MOUNTCREST INN ON 5TH STREET, ROOM 6"				* 
"PUT HIM ONTO TEDDY OR JUST GET RID OF HIM FOR NATALIE" 
Leonard picks the stack of Polaroids out of his outside jacket pocket. He flips through them until he finds the one of Teddy, then picks up the phone and dials Teddy's number. The phone is answered:

He places the BOOK on the fire. He reaches into the bag, produces a BRA and a HAIRBRUSH. He puts the bra on the fire, then pulls some BLACK HAIR out of the hairbrush. He holds a few strands out above the fire until they shrivel up in the heat. He does this with a larger clump and it produces a SMALL FLAME so he DROPS it into the fire. 
LEONARD (V.O.) Probably tried this before. Probably burned truckloads of your stuff. Can't remember to forget you. 
He DROPS the brush onto the fire, pulls a GREEN ALARM CLOCK out of the bag and adds it to the fire. Once the bag is EMPTY, Leonard places it on the fire. He sits looking at the flames.

He flips Teddy's picture over, like a croupier turning a card at blackjack. On the back it says:

LEONARD (V.O.) She told me about life with Sammy, how she'd treated him. It had got to the point where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house, then stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember where he'd hidden the stuff. She wasn't a cruel person, she just wanted her old Sammy back. 
The tearful Mrs. Jankis gives Leonard a determined look. 
MRS. JANKIS Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking - 
LEONARD Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is "faking" anything, just that his condition can't be shown - 
MRS. JANKIS I'm not interested in the company position, Mr. Shelby. I want to know your honest opinion about Sammy.

Leonard shrugs. 
NATALIE (cont'd) Well, it seems like Jimmy knows you. He told me about you. Said you were staying over at the Discount. Then, just this			  * evening, this cop comes in here looking			* for you. Looking for a guy who couldn't remember stuff, who'd forget how he got here or where he was going. I told him we get a lot of guys like that in here. 
Leonard does not find this funny.

Leonard examines it, PUZZLED. All that is visible is AN ARM,    * lying on a floor. Leonard reaches into the other pocket and	* pulls out his POLAROIDS, flicking through them until he finds the one of Teddy. He flips it over and checks the back: 
"DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES" 
Leonard reacts with amused RELIEF. 
LEONARD (under his breath) Sneaky fuck. "Bad Cop". Had me going. 
Leonard puts his jacket back on, checks the other pockets. He finds a BEER MAT for a local bar named FERDY'S. There is a message written on it: 
"COME BY AFTERWARDS, NATALIE" 
Leonard sticks it back in his pocket. He PEEKS through the curtains. Teddy is sitting by the door, waiting. Leonard looks around, NOTICES a window set high in the wall above the padded bench in the cubicle. Leonard CLIMBS on the bench, OPENS the window and SQUEEZES himself through.

Leonard lowers the camera and takes out a pen, resting the picture against the truck, about to write on the white strip beneath the developing picture. 
LEONARD (cont'd) I'm sorry - is it Officer, or Lieutenant Gammell? 
Teddy coughs and looks at the picture.

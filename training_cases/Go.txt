EXT. A DITCH - NIGHT 
A light rain and crickets CHIRPING. Somewhere in the night, DANCE MUSIC is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a beat. 
Water trickles out of a jagged pipe. Splashing up mud, the riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached beer cans, spent condoms and an old Spin magazine. 
The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a woman. Face up, breathing. Dead grass caught in her braids. Her name is RONNA MARTIN. She's eighteen and bleeding. 
Bleeding a lot. 
She tries to         push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles. Her legs are         useless. Despite it all, there's a smile of perverse joy         to her face, like she's just remembered the punchline to         a favorite joke. 
CLAIRE (V.O.) You know what I like best about Christmas? The surprises.

Pitch black. We hear an ENGINE and ROAD NOISE. 
CLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D) It's like, you get this box, and you're sure you know what's in it. 
SPARKS. A cigarette lighter flares. 
We're in the trunk of a car with SIMON BAINES (22), a skinny Brit with surfer hair. He looks around, realizes where he is. Panicked, he starts POUNDING and KICKING. 
CLAIRE (V.O., CONT'D) You shake it, you weigh it, and you're totally convinced you have it pegged. No doubt in your mind. 
The lighter goes out. It's black again.

We keep tight on CLAIRE MONTGOMERY (19) as she talks to an unseen guest. Christmas lights blink behind her. 
CLAIRE (CONT'd) But then you open it up, and it's something completely different. Bing! Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like you and me here. 
She takes a sip of coffee, smiles. She has a bewitching smile. 
CLAIRE I'm not saying this is anything it's not. But c'mon. This time yesterday, who'dda thunk it?

A cash drawer slides shut. 
On the far side of the checkout stand, a STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN counts food stamps. Her eyes are sunken, black. She's got a screaming BABY on her arm and two rambunctious BOYS in the cart. They're wearing pajamas and raincoats. 
It's five a.m. and the store is almost empty. 
Containers of frozen orange juice spin endlessly on the conveyor belt. Ronna Martin -- the girl in the ditch -- is bagging groceries. 
RONNA Paper or plastic? 
She wears a green apron with a red "Yule Save More" button.

RONNA Paper or plastic? 
She's been working for fourteen hours, and it shows. Her intonation doesn't change at all. 
RONNA Paper or plastic? 
STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN Both. 
Finally satisfied she has all her stamps, the Woman starts looking through the receipt. In the cart, the boys knock gum from the stand. 
STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN You didn't double my coupons. 
RONNA They're at the bottom. In red. Where it says, double coupons. 
She finishes one bag and starts another. The Woman is watching her carefully. 
STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN You can't do that. You can't put bleach in the same bag as food. It's poison. 
Ronna fishes out the bleach and makes a big show of wrapping it in a plastic bag. 
STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN Don't think you're something you're not. I used to have your job. 
Ronna puts the bag in the cart. Looks her dead in the eye. 
RONNA Look how far it got you. 
5   INT. SUPERMARKET AISLE - DAY                                                   5 
Ronna pulls off her apron as she heads for the back. In the BACKGROUND, the Stringy Haired Woman is bitching to an overweight STORE MANAGER. 
MANNIE (17) pulls his arm back through with the orange juice.                    * He's on break with Ronna and Claire.                                             * VOICE ON INTERCOM                                         * Repeat, cashier to the front.                                       * All eyes look up to the voice of God. 
CLAIRE One of us has to go. 
MANNIE                                                    * Dead celebrities?                                                   * RONNA                                                     * Loser goes up. Steve McQueen.                                       * She rips open a case of Snapple, taking one.                                     * CLAIRE M...M... 
Mannie is checking out a small printed rave invite. 
In a flash of inspiration... 
CLAIRE Michael Landon. 
MANNIE Lucille Ball.

We MOVE CLOCKWISE with a rapid, snooze-you-lose pace. 
RONNA Burt Lancaster. (to Mannie, re: invite) Can you drive? 
CLAIRE L...L... 
MANNIE If you don't mind The Beast. 
RONNA I love The Beast. 
CLAIRE Lane Staley. (off reaction) Alice in Chains.

Claire just stands there confused, mouthing "X...X..." Mannie scoops a fingerful of whipped cream from a tub. 
CLAIRE You can't say Malcolm X. 
RONNA He's famous, he's dead. 
MANNIE That's like a rule or something. Nothing starts with X. 
He puts the tub back on the shelf. 
RONNA That's not my problem. 
MANNIE (to Claire) You can challenge. 
CLAIRE Okay, I challenge. Give me one dead celebrity that starts with X. 
RONNA This is bullshit. I am not working the                                * fucking register. 
She's winning no sympathy. Mannie starts to audibly CLICK the countdown. Ronna shoots him a withering look. 
RONNA X...X...There is one. I know I thought of one before. 
A jug of milk suddenly shifts to the side, revealing the bulbous face of the Manager, looking through from the store side. 
SWITTERMAN Break was over four minutes ago. Who's up front? 
Claire looks at Mannie. Mannie looks at Ronna. Resigned to martyrdom... 
RONNA I am.

10   INT. SUPERMARKET / CHECKOUT LANE - DAY                                  10 
Ronna rips off a receipt, handing it to a CLUTCHY OLD WOMAN. Starts scanning someone else's groceries. Mannie is digging out returns from under Ronna's checkstand. He suddenly looks up. 
MANNIE Xerxes. 
RONNA What? 
MANNIE Xerxes. Some dead pharaoh guy. Starts with X. 
RONNA That wasn't it. I never heard of fucking "Xerxes." 
MANNIE Pharaoh coulda saved your ass. 
Mannie pushes his cart down to the next checkstand. 
VOICE (O.S.) There's an opera about him. 
Ronna looks up at the customer, a handsome college guy (ADAM). He's cute in that fresh-scrubbed, Midwestern way. 
RONNA Both of you chill the fuck out. It's just once. When Simon gets back, we can still overpay for quarters if it makes you feel all warm and happy. But this is my deal, so just sit back and watch. 
Mannie and Claire remain unconvinced. Ronna reaches for the keys, CRANKING the ignition even though Mannie's driving. The ENGINE purrs. 
RONNA (CONT'd) Besides, Todd likes me. This won't be any problem. 
A BUZZER sounds. 
12   EXT. DOORSTEP - NIGHT                                                     12 
Ronna stands by the intercom of a two-story walkup in Hollywood. Waiting, she looks back to the street, where The Beast sits idle at the curb. 
INTERCOM VOICE Speak! 
RONNA Todd! It's Ronna Martin. You know me through Simon. 
A long pause. 
INTERCOM VOICE Yeah? 
RONNA Can I come up? 
Another long pause. Ronna looks back at The Beast, embarrassed. Finally the door BUZZES and a latch CLICKS open. Stairs lead up. 
She motions back "five minutes" to The Beast.

Three out of four lights are burned out in the hallway. 
A few feet ahead of Ronna, a door stands partly ajar. A weird red-and-green light spills out through the crack, along with an Alice in Chains SONG. 
14   INT. APARTMENT / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                     14 
Ronna pushes the door open from the hallway. 
RONNA Todd? 
Shades drawn, the room is completely insulated from reality. The light bulbs have been markered over, casting eerie pools of red and green light. Broken CD's dangle off a tiny Christmas tree by the stereo. Slacker seasonalism. 
GAINES (O.S.) Don't let the cat out. 
Ronna closes the door behind her. 
TODD GAINES emerges from the darkened bedroom, tying the string on a pair of sweat pants. That's all he's wearing. 
RONNA I didn't wake you up, did I? 
GAINES Nah. 
He settles into an overstuffed couch and lights a Marlboro. Adjusts himself in the crotch. Motions for her to take a chair. She's more nervous than she wants to let on. 
GAINES I thought you were still buying quarters off Simon. Least what Simon pretends are quarters. 
RONNA I keep him honest. 
GAINES At that level you're supposed to pinch. It's the economics of it.

IN THE BACKGROUND 
A WOMAN with a ballerina's body comes out of the bedroom. She tucks an unrealistically large breast down into her tight top. 
GAINES You leaving? 
She leans over the back of the sofa for quick, tonguey kiss. In a sneak attack, she shoves a Santa's hat down to his ears. He bats the white pom out of his eyes. 
GAINES Be good. 
The woman is out the door without a word. Gaines looks back over at Ronna, not the least bit self-conscious about the hat. 
GAINES I take it this is not a social call. 
RONNA I need a favor. 
GAINES A favor? Wow. I didn't know we were such good friends, Ronna. Because if we were, you would know I give head before I give favors. I don't even give my best friends head, so the chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim. (beat) You might try just telling me what you want to buy. 
RONNA Twenty hits of ecstacy. 
He takes a deep drag on the cigarette, looking at her. Blows the smoke out. He picks up a remote control. Aims it at the stereo. 
CLOSE UP 
The volume meter, climbing fast. Out of the green, into the red. The MUSIC is deafening. 
ON GAINES 
On top of Ronna, face in her ear. His hand wraps around her head, holding her tight. We can't HEAR what he's saying. Ronna's eyes betray her fear.

He backs off. She looks confused. 
He nods. Do it. 
The MUSIC still BLARING, she stands and slowly unbuttons her shirt. Takes it off -- very self-consciously. Pulls her t- shirt off over her head. Just her bra underneath. He motions for her to turn around. She does, then back. 
Her hands are shaking. She holds them together. 
Gaines aims the remote at the stereo. The MUSIC retreats. 
Adam steps away from the door. 
Ronna backs her way out the door, never taking her eyes off them. The door CLOSES. 
A BEAT. Adam and Zack await the fury. Burke looks back to the hallway. 
28   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT (NORMAL)                                             28 
A white guy with dreadlocks comes out of a locked door. His name is LOOP. 
LOOP Man, I don't know what happened, it's like the machine just ate the tape. 
He cracks a videotape against the doorframe, pulling out the innards.

29   EXT/INT. THE BEAST ON STREET - NIGHT                                     29 
The car is parked on the side of another residential street. 
RONNA I think it was Simon they were after. He deals all the time out of the store. I mean, he makes change out of the fucking register. 
MANNIE They didn't know who was dealing, just that it was someone at the store? 
RONNA They were fishing. I bit. 
Ronna's PAGER goes off with a shrill BEEPING. She checks the number. 
RONNA It's Claire. She paged me while I was in there. 
MANNIE We go back to Todd. Tell him they didn't show up, whatever. And then just swap the pills for Claire. 
RONNA We can't. 
MANNIE Why not? 
RONNA They're gone. I flushed them. 
MANNIE Oh shit. 
RONNA Think of something. I need a hundred bucks or 20 hits of X. 
A long silent beat as both put on their thinking caps. Mannie tries to beat down a smile that curls the edges of his lips. He clenches his jaw, trying to keep it in.

RONNA What?! 
She turns his chin to hold his eyes to the light. They're wild and dilated. And his smile resurfaces despite his best efforts. 
RONNA You took one, didn't you? Fuck you, Mannie! How could you do this to me? I need you now. 
He sits quietly, a scolded dog. 
RONNA Drive. 
MANNIE Where? 
RONNA Just drive. I have an idea. 
30   INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT                                                 30 
A sign over the entrance reads "Yule Save More." Christmas MUSAK blares "Jingle Bell Rock" overhead. 
The automatic doors slide open to reveal Ronna and Mannie, who split up. We follow Ronna, who is now wearing Mannie's black trench coat. The store is almost empty, with STOCKMEN beginning to unload palettes. 
Ronna turns down an aisle marked "Soap/Shampoo/Drugs." 
31   INT. AT THE MANAGER'S COUNTER - NIGHT                                    31 
Mannie scans his hand on a UPC register, watching the laser on his fingers, listening to it BWOOP. He smiles broadly at an idle REGISTER WOMAN, who doesn't even look up. He then ducks down behind the counter. 
A CRAPPY CD PLAYER spins away. He presses the "| " button, then cranks the volume dial all the way up. 
The opening FLOURISHES of a Latinized Christmas classic BLAST through the PA system.

A COUPON-WIELDING WOMAN looks up, confused, but proceeds to push her cart around the end of the row. 
Ronna looks both ways. She's alone. 
She starts grabbing boxes off the shelf and shoving them into the pockets of Mannie's coat. Cold medicine. Allergy medicine. Every pill she can find. 
SWITTERMAN 
comes ROARING by behind her, heading for the front. She tries to duck away, but he's too steamed to even notice her. 
Ronna does a quick check to see if she got everything. Hurrying down the aisle, she swipes a bottle of Evian. 
35   INT. END OF ANOTHER AISLE - NIGHT                                       35 TM The two stockboys give a wide-eyed, Spielberg           stare...

He gestures like he's going to click on the CD player, but instead points it at her. 
GAINES Are you a virgin? 
CLAIRE What? 
GAINES C'mon, Claire. Answer the question. Answer the question, Claire. 
She doesn't say anything. Gaines laughs his ass off. 
CLAIRE Breakfast Club. I get it. 
GAINES Look at me. I want to show you something. 
She looks back over at him. He slowly undoes the drawstring to his sweat pants. Starts to reach inside. Claire watches, revolted and disbelieving. A beat. 
GAINES I'm kidding! 
His hand reaches between the cushions of the couch, where he pulls out a 9mm handgun. 
GAINES I'm not kidding. Where the fuck are they, Claire? 
The gun pointed at her, Claire is losing her shit. Her face squeezes tight, like her head's being sucked through a tiny hole. Just when she's about to pop... 
The BUZZER sounds. 
Saved by the bell. 
Gaines pushes the TALK button on the intercom. 
GAINES Speak!

Smiling, Gaines hits the DOOR button. Claire collects her wits.

RONNA Don't say anything. And try not to look so stoned.

40   INT. GAINES' APARTMENT - NIGHT                                         40 
Gaines sits pensively on the edge of the couch, then smiles warmly. 
GAINES That's no problem. These things happen, I understand that. 
Claire smiles, relieved. Mannie stands behind Ronna, his gaze carefully fixed on the wall. 
GAINES (CONT'd) Let me just fill out a return slip here, and I'll have the manager give you a refund. 
RONNA Todd, I'm trying to explain what happened. They had already gotten stuff from somewhere else. It was just a case of miscommunication, I thought... 
Ronna's VOICE fades to nothing as we PUSH IN on Mannie. 
A SIAMESE CAT 
lays down on a table in front of him, staring at him. 
HUXLEY [SUBTITLES ONLY] I can hear your thoughts. 
Mannie squints, looks around. He and the cat are alone in the room. 
HUXLEY [SUBTITLES] Xiang Kai-Shek. Famous Chinese ruler guy. Starts with X.

Mannie smiles. 
MANNIE [SUBTITLES] No. "C" Chiang Kai-Shek. 
The cat curls itself. 
HUXLEY [SUBTITLES] You're going to die. 
Mannie snaps back, eyes panicked. 
It's a few minutes later. Everyone's in different places, different moods. Mannie hasn't moved at all. 
GAINES (handing back cash) I'm keeping fifty. Call it interest. 
RONNA That's fine. Todd, I'm really sorry about all this. 
Ronna steers Mannie towards the door, trying to keep his back to Todd. But at the last moment... 
GAINES Hey Ronna. 
A beat. Todd shakes the pill bottle. 
GAINES I just gave you a favor. 
MUSIC builds throughout. 
Standing at the dresser, Gaines cracks open Ronna's bottle. Pills spill out on a plate. He counts them, pushing them aside in groups with a card. Stops. Picks one up. Looks at it more closely... 
Pulls open a drawer full of socks. Digs out the wide-mouthed bottle. Shakes out a pill.

Flicks on a desk lamp. Looks at both pills in his hand, comparing... 
Fuck. 
He flips over the card on the dresser. Mary Xmas. The invite Claire gave him. 
With a sudden RAGE, he WINGS the plate against the far wall. It SHATTERS. 
The music EXPLODES and we're... 
48   INT. WAREHOUSE / MARY XMAS SUPAFEST - NIGHT                                48 
A grinding, sweating sea of humanity. In the mosh pit, SKINHEADS and coked-up POSEURS run in blind circles. A stringy- haired EYELINER BOY crashes into 
RONNA 
who had her own groove going. She shoves him back into the wheel, a foot on his ass. 
Claire, behind her, YELLS something in her ear. We can't hear a thing. Ronna downs the rest of her drink, hands Claire the cup. That's not what Claire meant -- she's a little pissed -- but Ronna is oblivious. 
Both hands free, Ronna pushes her way deeper into the eye of the storm. She adjusts her holly crown. She's sky high and loving every minute of it.

The line to get in is longer still, snaking down the wall. Fila Guy is talking to a friend in a SPIDER MARINE shirt. 
FILA GUY This girl inside. She and her friend have it. 
SPIDER MARINE Ecstasy? The real shit?

Sweating hard, Mannie is pressed back against a pole, shirt over his head. Two nose-ringed RIOT GRRRLS are drawing a Christmas tree on his chest and stomach with a fat magic marker. 
Looking over at the entrance, he watches some GAPSTERS move past the BOUNCERS. And behind them, 
TODD GAINES. 
Mannie's drugged eyes go wide with panic. He hunches down. Gaines starts looking around the edge of the crowd. 
Mannie works his way into the mob. 
STROBES fire overhead. 
Ronna dances on, oblivious... Gaines circles, searching... Mannie fights his way through the outer ring of MOSHERS... 
Through the crowd, we see Gaines looking in... Mannie grabs Ronna... She smiles, tries to kiss him... 
He YELLS in her ear. He has to repeat himself... She looks back over her shoulder... A space in the crowd... 
She sees Gaines. He sees her. 
The MUSIC STOPS. Dead silence. 
Ronna and Gaines trade stares for what feels like an eternity, until suddenly... 
The MUSIC BLASTS back, harder than ever. Like a shot, Ronna and Mannie are out of there. Gaines plows through the crowd, coming after them. 
51   EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY - NIGHT                                             51 
A side door BLASTS open, Ronna dragging Mannie by the wrist. They race down the alley. A burly BOUNCER shouts after them:

BOUNCER HEY!! (re: sign on door) NO EXIT!! 
The Bouncer is blindsided by Gaines, who charges after Ronna. 
52   EXT. DIFFERENT ALLEY - NIGHT                                              52 
Ronna pulls Mannie into a covered doorway, a niche set off from the alley. They hide back in the shadows as 
GAINES 
races past. Ronna kneels down to Mannie, who's hunched over his knees sweating and shaking. 
RONNA What's wrong? Mannie? 
She puts a hand on his sweating forehead.         His cheeks. 
RONNA Jesus. You're burning up. 
MANNIE I can't feel my hands. 
RONNA Listen to me. We're going to find Claire and get out of here. 
She COUGHS as she laughs, spitting out some blood. We PULL BACK, rising higher until we slowly 
FADE OUT.

Offscreen, a SOAP OPERA plays. Simon is on the phone, a well- worn employee list in his hands. 
SIMON (ON PHONE) No, no. Donde Miguel?                                             * Claire leans against the wall beside him, skeptical but amused. She turns a box of cookies over in her hands, reading the ingredients. 
SIMON (ON PHONE) Jalisco? (to Claire) Where is Jalisco? 
CLAIRE Mexico. 
Fuck. Simon hangs up the phone without saying goodbye. He continues down the list. 
CLAIRE Simon, no one is going to take your shift. 
Ronna comes around the corner, zombie-tired. She heads to her locker. Simon watches her, an idea forming.

A cigarette lighter. The flame finally catches and we see Simon. He feels around, touching the ceiling, the walls, the floor. He's locked in the trunk of a car. 
SIMON Shit. Shit! 
He starts kicking, hyperventilating. The lighter goes out.

Simon keeps KICKING. 
SIMON Fucking let me out of here! 
The lighter burns his thumb. He switches hands. Listens for a second. The car isn't driving anymore. 
He tries to catch his breath, but keeps getting more panicked. A key SCRAPES in the lock. 
The trunk lid opens a crack. Bright daylight spills in. 
Simon KICKS the lid and pops up, ready to swing a tire iron. 
THREE MEN 
back off, laughing. We are... 
60   EXT. SIDE OF INTERSTATE - DAY                                             60 
TINY Mo'fuckin Jack-in-the-box. 
TINY (19) is not black, but thinks he is. 
Simon climbs out of the trunk and does a face-plant in the gravel. He's shit-faced drunk. 
MARCUS Dude, you passed out before we left L.A. 
MARCUS (24) was a tailback at UCLA, and still has the build. He is black, and has no confusion over this matter. 
Simon is about to reply when he suddenly HEAVES. Everyone backs away. Tiny takes the tire iron, puts it to the side of the trunk. He starts cranking it while HUMMING "Pop Goes the Weasel," ending with... 
TINY Pop! Goes the asshole.

A massive land yacht from the pre-Embargo era. SINGH (23) is driving, nursing a beer. Marcus reads a magazine. Tiny talks from the enormous back seat, where Simon is recuperating. 
TINY So this chick, she's bobbing up and down on my dick like she's fucking Marilyn Chambers. 
SINGH She actually found your dick? 
TINY (ignoring) Then she starts going around the ouside-- you know, painting the tree--when WHACK! It hits her in the eye. And her contact, it's like stuck on my dick. 
TINY Six months!

63   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                                               63 
We hear slot machines CHIMING in the distance. Marcus picks a gold card up from the counter. 
MARCUS (reading) Todd Gaines. The drug dealer. 
SIMON He gets a discount. He let me use it. He's a good guy. 
MARCUS He's the good drug dealer. I get confused. 
SIMON We'll pay cash anyway. This is just to get the room. 
The Desk Woman returns with their keys. 
SIMON Could you answer a question... (checks nametag) ...Rachel? Hypothetically, do you think a man could make love to a woman for 14 hours without ever achieving climax? 
DESK WOMAN I think my manager would be better able to answer that question. Would you like me to call him over? 
SIMON No. Not necessary. 
DESK WOMAN Great then. Welcome to the Riviera. 
Simon walks away with Marcus.

Doubled over, Tiny BANGS on the bathroom door. Singh emerges, pale and sweating. He steps over Tiny, who crawls in. Hanging up his clothes, Marcus waves away the smell. 
Singh MOANS, lying down on a bed. 
MARCUS Did I tell you not to eat the shrimp? 
SINGH I have something for you. Where did I put it? Oh, it's right here. 
He gives him the finger. Simon is on the phone by the window. 
SIMON (over action) Todd, it's Simon. What's up?...I'm in Vegas, we just got here. What was the name of the place you said we should go...The Crazy Horse. What are you doing tonight? 
Marcus neatly unfolds his clothes, hanging them up in the closet. 
SIMON (on phone) You're going to a wedding?...What is it, a rave? 
From the wall, KNOCKING. Simon and Marcus look to a door by the window. 
SIMON (on phone) No, I know Claire...Are you going to fuck her? 
Simon points at the KNOCKING door. Marcus finally opens it to reveal a 12 year-old BOY in the adjoining hotel room. 
BOY Who are you? 
MARCUS This is our room. 
Simon leans around to look.

Simon and Marcus are fully macked out. Marcus adjusts the shoulders of his bright yellow jacket. 
SIMON Did I mention how much I like your jacket? 
MARCUS No. 
SIMON There's a reason. 
The elevator bell BINGS.

Simon finds Marcus at a blackjack table. 
SIMON Let me borrow some money. 
MARCUS Where's your money? 
SIMON I lost it 
The DEALER is waiting for Marcus to play. He takes a card, bust. 
MARCUS We've been here five minutes. 
SIMON I was playing this game at a hundred dollar table and I didn't understand it, but now I do. I think I figured out how to beat it. 
MARCUS Let me see your wallet.

Seething, Marcus joins Simon in line for a cab. A white Ferrari pulls up to the curb beside them. The FERRARI MAN tosses the keys at Marcus, who can't help but catch them. 
FERRARI MAN Keep it close and there's an extra ten bucks for you. 
He slips Marcus a five as he rushes into the casino. A beat. Simon is cracking up. As we REVERSE, we see the valets are wearing the same yellow sportcoat as Marcus. 
MARCUS Get in. Get in the car. Get in. 
76   INT. THE FERRARI / DRIVING ON FREEWAY - NIGHT                            76 
Top off, wind whipping. Marcus downshifts, letting the engine RACE as he passes another sports car. The STEREO is blasting. 
Pale and dazed, Simon tries to light a cigarette. It blows out of his fingers. It was his last. He adjusts himself in his seat, uncomfortable. 
SIMON (shouting over noise) Question. When you're doing tantra, you hold it in at the end, right?

MARCUS No. Never. Redirect the energy, but you never hold it in. Haven't you ever gotten blue balls? Hurts like a bitch. 
SIMON (nodding) Sort of a dull ache. 
MARCUS Exactly. 
Marcus looks over to Simon, who is trying to get his breath. 
77   INT. FERRARI / DRIVING DOWNTOWN - LATER                                  77 
Empty intersections, no traffic to speak of. Marcus is looking for a cross-street. They're lost. 
MARCUS See if there's a map. 
Simon goes through the glove compartment. Amid the condoms and parking tickets, he finds one. 
SIMON Orange County. 
He throws it out. He tries to shut the compartment, but it's caught on something. He reaches in... 
SIMON Holy shit. 
Marcus looks over. Simon gently pulls out a 9mm Baretta. Fascinated, he turns it over in his hands. Marcus tries to keep an eye on the road. 
MARCUS Don't point it at me! 
SIMON How do I know if it's loaded? 
MARCUS First, you stop pointing it at me. 
Simon aims the other way, out the window. As they drive through an intersection, they pass a car full of LOCALS.

Simon throws the gun to the floor. Marcus flinches, expecting it to go off. It doesn't. He checks the rear-view mirror. No trouble. Simon picks up the gun again. 
SIMON I've never held a real gun before. It's heavier than I thought. 
MARCUS Great, put it back. 
SIMON I want to know if it's loaded. How do I... 
He starts pulling and pushing on it, trying to get the clip out. He's not going to stop until he does it or shoots himself trying. 
MARCUS Hold the wheel. 
Marcus removes the clip, hands it over. Simon counts the bullets. 
SIMON I hold ten men's lives in my hand. 
MARCUS It's a nine millimeter. It doesn't have stopping power. 
SIMON Right. For that you'd need Magnum Force.

At a pull-up payphone, Marcus is looking through the map in the phone book. Simon is still fondling the gun. 
SIMON This is why I came here. This is America. I'm serious. You want to take one symbol for all of America, it's not the flag or the hawk...

The curtain parts, letting the women through. From the darkened space beyond, a giant BOUNCER steps out -- massive even compared to Marcus. He's sucking on a lollipop. 
VIC JR. I need a major credit card. 
Marcus looks to Simon, who hands over the gold card. Vic Jr. reads them the boilerplate... 
VIC JR. This is a gentlemen's club. You are expected to behave as gentlemen. I will be giving you one rule. If you break this rule, I will break your arm. Are we clear? 
MARCUS Yes. 
VIC JR. The ladies can touch you. You cannot touch them. At any point, for any reason. Is this clear? 
SIMON Crystal.

A mirrored ball spins overhead, stars racing across the black paneling. Holly nudges Simon into his chair. He and Marcus sit back to back. 
As the champage POPS, we move into a series of overlapping shots: 
Noelle licks the foam from Holly's fingers. Holly rubs the bottle against herself, pours. Noelle and Holly dance together, a tinsel ribbon around them. 
Simon adjusts himself in the crotch. 
Noelle lights a cigar for Marcus as Holly dances alone. Holly lifts her miniskirt to reveal a g-string. Simon cranes his neck back, banging heads with Marcus.

Noelle takes a puff off the cigar. Holly straddles Simon, rubs against him. He shudders. His hands start to rise. She gently pushes them back down. 
Marcus whispers something to Noelle. 
Noelle comes up behind Holly, moving with her as she rubs against Simon. Marcus turns to watch. 
Enraptured, Simon watches the four-armed woman on top of him. 
His fingers start to twitch. 
Noelle kisses the edge of Holly's neck. Simon's hands rise, reach... Holly MOANS... 
And suddenly... 
Simon grabs Noelle's ass. 
It's Heaven. 
NOELLE (yelling) Hands! Hands! 
Noelle and Holly both get off him. Holly kicks his leg. From behind the curtain, Vic Jr. charges in. He heads straight for Marcus. 
NOELLE The other one! 
Simon tumbles off his chair, scrambling. 
VIC JR. What the fuck did I tell you! 
He kicks Simon in the ass. 
MARCUS Yo. Yo! He fucked up, he lost control.

Vic Jr. kicks Simon again. 
MARCUS Enough! Stop kicking him. (no effect) I said to fucking stop kicking him. 
Vic Jr. turns on Marcus. A beat. He shoves him, hard. 
MARCUS I'm not trying to throw down here. 
VIC JR. (another shove) You think you can kick my ass? 
MARCUS I don't want to try. 
Vic Jr. WHACKS Marcus, an old-fashioned bitch slap. A beat. Marcus tries to keep the rage down. Feels his nose bleeding. 
He backs away, but Vic Jr. keeps coming. Suddenly... 
A GUNSHOT. 
SCREAMS. 
For a beat, no one's sure what happened. We look around to Marcus. Vic Jr. Holly. Noelle. Then finally Simon. 
He just fired. The gun is steady in his hand. 
Marcus checks his shirt. A spray of blood. 
Vic Jr. checks his arm. It's bleeding.

She half-listens as Ronna and Simon have their discussion at the lockers, then at the time clock. 
Simon follows Ronna out into the alley. 
Claire takes a seat atop a crappy console TV, eating an oatmeal cookie. The VOICES on the soap opera seem familiar.

Loop -- the white dreadlocked guy -- retapes a transmitter on his thigh. A wire runs up to a microphone on his chest.

At the refrigerator section, both Adam and Zack reach for orange juice. Both back off. Adam motions, after you. 
ADAM So, Zack. Do you know who your girlfriend's fucking? 
He over-articulates, as if speaking for a Learn English Now! tape. Zack does likewise. Their animosity is palpable. 
ZACK No, Adam. I do not. I have suspicions. Mostly former boyfriends who keep calling. 
ADAM What a coincidence. I have the exact same problem with my girlfriend. In fact, I think she's been sleeping around on me, too. 
ZACK Isn't it ironic. 
ADAM Don't you think? (beat) Maybe I should start checking for socks, too. 
Zack's glare could strip paint. 
As Adam and Zack head for the front, we REVERSE to find Mannie and Claire, who have been watching the spat while restocking. 
CLAIRE Gay men are so hot. It's tragic.

Zack pushes the cart past the checkstands, looking at each CASHIER -- they're all female. Adam is starting to panic. In near whispers... 
ADAM He's not here. What are we supposed to do? He's not here. 
ZACK We're going to ask. You're going to ask. 
ADAM Why me? 
ZACK You look more wholesome. Just improv. 
He steers the cart into Ronna's checkstand, where she's waiting on a Clutchy Old Woman who eyes everything suspiciously. Zack pulls out his cell phone, fake dials. 
ADAM Who are you calling? 
ZACK Nobody. I'm giving you an opening. 
129   INT. CAR IN PARKING LOT - DAY                                         129

ADAM He wasn't there. The British guy, he wasn't there.

BURKE This chick... (checks notebook) Ronna. You think she can score?

Burke is watching through binoculars. Adam, Zack and Loop are in the car with him. 
BURKE Now they're both going. What's up with that? 
132A INT. VENICE HOUSE / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT                                   132A 
Adam and Zack stand around as Burke gets the house ready, moving furniture and poofing pillows, as if it's remotely believable. 
ZACK So if she gets the stuff, what, you arrest her? 
BURKE We try to bring her over. (beat) See, we arrest her and then what? One crack whore off the street. So we cut her a deal. She helps us get this guy. We cut him a deal. He helps us get the guy above him. It's just like what happened with you. 
ZACK So, sooner or later, everybody's working for The Man.

ADAM Huh. (beat; another; then suddenly) Wow, I can't believe I forgot this. I saw your girlfriend this morning, and she asked me to tell you that she couldn't make your plans tonight.

135   EXT. A TINY HOUSE IN CULVER CITY - NIGHT                                135 
Zack hits the alarm for his red Miata, which BWOOPS. He and Adam walk to the door, hostility simmering. 
A prefab Nativity scene glows beside the front door. Adam pushes the doorbell, which CHIMES "Hark Ye Herald Angels Sing." Horrified, Zack turns to leave. Adam stops him. 
136   INT. LIVING / DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                       136 
Too tall for the room, a Christmas tree leans back in a corner. The rest of the living room is dominated by a giant leather sofa pit. 
Bored, Adam lifts a plate to check the imprint. He sets it down, straightening it. Now it's out of alignment with the other plates. He looks around casually. No one's watching. 
Circling the table, he fixes all the plates and moves silverware to its proper position.

Burke's wife IRENE is mashing potatoes with considerable zeal. Adam leans in, sees her dedication and tries to duck out. But she saw him. 
IRENE Yes? Hi? 
ADAM Sorry. Phone. Messages. Check? 
IRENE Here. 
She points. He sheepishly crosses to get it. While he's dialing, Irene starts in with the electric mixer. Butter. Milk. Salt. Adam doesn't know where to look while he's listening to his messages. 
He suddenly smiles. Irene notices and stops mixing. 
ADAM (re: phone) They're singing Christmas carols. My family. Minnesota, they do that. 
She leans close to listen. Smiles. She continues to lean close -- uncomfortably close -- for a long beat.

We hear a toilet FLUSH. Zack emerges from the bathroom to find Burke stark naked, rubbing his hands over his body. 
ZACK Sorry. 
BURKE No, stay for a sec. 
Burke sprays more cologne on his hand. 
BURKE Smell this. What does it smell like? 
Zack shakes his head, doesn't know.

ZACK Really. 
BURKE I get this for a quarter what that stuff costs. 
ZACK It's nice. 
BURKE Here. 
He sprays some on Zack's hands, who didn't want it. While Burke turns to get some underwear, Zack tries to rub it off on the bedspread. 
BURKE (re: bedspread) It's down. So is the liner. 
ZACK It is soft. 
BURKE Get on. 
ZACK That's okay. 
Burke pushes Zack back flat the bed. 
BURKE Did you hear that? 
ZACK Hear what? 
BURKE Exactly. Individually wrapped springs. Top quality. 
Burke climbs onto the bed beside him. 
BURKE I could be doing aerobics over here and you wouldn't feel it.

ADAM Jimmy? 
ZACK Jimmy. Jimmy. 
They both stand for a moment, bewildered. It's their turn at the register. Adam sets the bottle down. 
A doorbell RINGS. 
143   INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT                                 143 
An apartment door opens to reveal a chubby girl in sweats (SANDRA) with a cordless phone and giant bowl of popcorn. She drops the former into the latter. 
ADAM Is Jimmy here? 
SANDRA Oh my God. Oh. My God. 
She's thrilled and disbelieving at the same time. She fishes the phone out of the bowl.

SANDRA (to phone) I'll call you back. (to them) Jimmy's not here. He went to this thing. Let me find it. 
She can't decide whether to close the door on them or not, so she only shuts it halfway. She pokes her head out the door again. 
SANDRA You do know, don't you? 
ZACK We know. 
SANDRA I take no responsibilty. I was only an innocent bystander. But there was once where you missed each other by three minutes. It was so exciting. 
She finds what she was looking for on the back of the door. Peels off a printed card. 
SANDRA It's some sort of rave thing. 
ZACK (takes card) Mary Xmas Supafest. 
SANDRA He left an hour ago. 
Adam and Zack head back down the hall. She calls out after them. 
SANDRA You're not going to kill him, are you? The little shit owes me rent.

ADAM I know. 
ZACK Mediocre at best. And the sounds he made, God. It was like having sex with Nell. 
Adam imitates the MOAN. 
ZACK Somewhere off Greenland, hunchback whales were beaching themselves. 
ADAM And the ear thing. Hello, I have Q-Tips. That's really not necessary. 
ZACK The only thing I will give him credit for is the oral. 
ADAM What do you mean? He was terrible. At some point I just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique. I had to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up.

ZACK When was that? 
ADAM October, maybe?

Before he can start to piss, he notices something strange. He looks down at his crotch.

Zack throws away the last of the towels as Adam approaches. 
With a finger to his lips, Adam holds out a mess of tape and wires, all connected to a battery pack. It's the microphone he was wearing. 
ZACK Holy sh... 
He stops himself. Adam throws the bundle as far as he can. They keep their voices low anyway. 
ZACK They wouldn't have been listening all this time. 
ADAM Hello, they could have been recording it. Everything we said could be on tape somewhere. They would know we did it. 
A beat. 
ZACK (an idea) What if we were just running lines? For a scene? 
Adam won't even dignify that with an answer. A long moment, just the BUZZ of the lights overhead. With an almost eerie calm...

The Supafest is still RAGING in the distance. Adam digs through the trunk of the convertible, frantically rearranging the junk inside. He keeps looking around the lid, waiting for someone to sneak up on them. 
Zack watches Adam's fruitless arranging efforts. 
ZACK Stop. Okay, stop! 
ADAM What? 
ZACK It's a Miata. 
All Adam's effort, he's made enough room for a pizza. Maybe. 
ZACK We'll put her in the passenger seat. 
ADAM Where will I...Or you... 
ZACK In the passenger seat. Holding her up. 
Adam shudders at the thought. 
With a flashlight, Zack jumps down into the ditch. He nudges Ronna's body with his foot. She's dead alright. 
He rolls the body over, grabbing under her arms. He tries to hoist her up, but she's too heavy and the ditch is too deep.

Frustrated, Zack tries again to lug the body out. He can't do it by himself. Meanwhile, Adam is starting to hyperventilate, tears swelling. 
ZACK Okay, listen to me... 
ADAM She's dead. 
ZACK She's not dead. 
ADAM She's dead. I hit her and I killed her. 
He looks around, expecting someone to walk up and see them. 
ZACK No you didn't, okay? This is all just make-believe. This is a scene. She's just acting dead. And you're just acting scared. 
Adam laughs to himself, still crying. 
ZACK See, there's the lights, and there's the camera. Watch your blocking. (pointing) There's Michelle in wardrobe, say "Hi, Michelle!"

Laying the paper flat, he tears off the bottom corner of the page and starts reading like a kid, his whole body leaning over the table. 
At the door, Claire comes in, shaking the rain out of her hair. After a beat, she does it again, as if she doesn't remember doing it the first time. She's tired and wired, all nerves and raw edges. There's static only she can feel. 
She looks right past Gaines, out to the rain on the street. He watches her, but doesn't try to catch her eye. The Jamaican WAITER walks past her with a pot of coffee. 
WAITER Anywhere you want. 
CLAIRE I'm meeting people. 
He doesn't care. Claire takes a seat at the table in front of her, but it's not to her liking. Then a booth. She plays with the salt shakers. Bad. 
It's only now that she sees Gaines watching her. At first she doesn't recognize him. Then a light goes on. She climbs over the booth and into his, facing him. 
CLAIRE Hey. 
GAINES Hey. 
CLAIRE We're twins. 
She turns over his hand, compares it to hers. They both have the same ink stamp on the back. He's busted, no way to talk himself out. 
The Waiter comes with coffee, refills Gaines' cup. 
Claire overturns the cup in front of her. The Waiter fills it. She overturns a second cup, points to it. A big weird smile. Reluctantly, the Waiter fills that too. Then leaves. 
CLAIRE I'll pay you back for breakfast. (leaning closer) Don't worry. I'm not really that hungry.

Halfway into getting her coat off, Claire has second thoughts, but continues nonetheless. Gaines is taken off-balance, his private space violated.

CLAIRE What do you have against The Family Circus? 
GAINES It's evil. 
CLAIRE Besides that. 
GAINES Okay. Location mostly. Bottom right corner, just waiting there to suck. It's the last thing you read, and it spoils everything you read before it. 
CLAIRE You could just not read it.

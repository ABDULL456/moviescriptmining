INT. ARCADE WORLD -- ELECTRONIC DARKNESS 
We don't know if it's night or day.  It's just black. 
And maybe...maybe intermittent SPARKS racing by.  So quick we barely perceive them.  Like the sparks you imagine when your eyes are closed. 
BREATHING, 
slow and hollow, filling up the entire world.  It's eerie as hell.  A feeling of utter loneliness. 
And now the breathing recedes, fading into the darkness.  Whatever it was...it's gone now. 
MAIN CREDITS ROLL. 
We hear CELLOS.  Four of them.  Weaving an intricate melody. 
And now the visuals.  BRIGHTLY COLORED SHAPES spinning in.  Equally intricate, matching the music.  They grow and flourish, like flowers opening up in time lapse photography. 
FRACTALS... 
is what they're called.  The visual manifestation of geometric formulas. The Mandelbrot Set.  The Julia Set.  Each mathematic form made up of progressively smaller forms and on into infinity. 
Glorious and beautiful.  Forms folding in upon themselves and regenerating. 
This is creation we're witnessing. 
This is life in the making. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY 
AN EYE 
For a brief moment we still hear the CELLOS.  And in the eye, the last of the fractals are spinning away, leaving us with the iris.  A nice blue one.  This is ALEX MANNING'S eye. 
ALEX (V.O.) Time.  That's all I ever think about anymore.  It's like there's never enough of it, you know? 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY 
This is a flashback, in case you're wondering.  We'll continue to hear Alex's VOICE as we move through the house in slow motion.  Everything is very bright and dreamlike. 
Right now we're moving with the camera, slowly moving down a long hallway. At the end of the hallway is an open door. 
We stop at the doorway.  We're afraid to go in. 
ALEX (V.O.) It's strange.  When the future's in front of you, it seems to go on forever.  I mean, you never really get there.  It's always one step ahead of you.  It's like there's no present. There's no "now".  As soon as you think, "I'm here", the moment's already gone.  Either everything's in the future, or it's in the past. (beat) There's no "now". 
MAN (V.O.) So where are you then? 
ALEX (V.O.) I'm in the past. 
We move through the doorway. 
INT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY 
Everything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlight streaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases. Everything looks perfect. 
Then we move further in, and over to the right.  There's something on the floor, curled up in the entranceway to the bathroom.  Halfway in, halfway out. 
It's a woman's body.  She's wearing a dress, her legs awkwardly bent.  We can't see her face from this angle. But in her limp hand is a gun.  And all around that hand, speckling the pristine white tile of the bathroom and the carpeting beyond, is BLOOD. 
A shrill BELL shatters the moment. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  COUNSELOR'S OFFICE -- DAY 
The bell continues.  It's a school bell signaling the end of the period. 
ON ALEX 
as we see her for the first time, startled.  She's seventeen and pretty, though in a simple way.  Her eyes are the most striking.  Deep.  Intense. If Alex has a problem, it's the fact that she thinks too much, and it's reflected in her eyes. 
Across from her is MR. WEAVER, a high-school guidance counselor and that was his voice we heard with Alex's. He's unexceptional, middle-aged, incapable of really hearing what Alex has to say.  This is his office we're in. Typical "SAY NO TO DRUGS" teen propaganda decorate the room. Fun. 
As the BELL dies we hear the army of FOOTSTEPS outside, students milling in the halls. 
GREG So tell me you're okay, then. 
ALEX I'm okay. 
GREG (smiles) Good.   Cause I'd freak if you weren't. 
Greg leans over and kisses Alex.  The rest of the group launches into exaggerated GROANS, with Benz and Stilts fluttering their eyes and making "smooching faces" at each other.  The kiss is over and everyone LAUGHS. 
Things are okay now. 
GREG (to Alex) Hey...watch this... 
Greg pulls an old Polaroid camera from his backpack.  He leans in close to her and holds the camera at arm's length, aiming it back at them.  FLASH! And the moment's captured forever. 
Greg pulls the Polaroid out and peels off the backing. Before the picture even develops, he begins rubbing his fingers over it, manipulating the emulsion. 
NICK (engrossed in his game again) You making another one, Greg? 
GREG Sure.  Practice. 
BENZ Lemme see... 
Greg pulls some papers from his backpack and slides them over to Benz. The papers are color xeroxes of Polaroid blow-ups.  Greg has messed with them, creating swirling, psychedelic patterns with the images.  Stilts and Laurie lean in. 
STILTS Cool. 
GREG (still working) See, when the emulsion's still warm you can move it around... (stops) There. 
Greg holds up the Polaroid for Alex to see. 
POLAROID 
Greg and Alex are side by side, grinning...all around them the world has spun into strange colors.  It's an odd effect. 
Greg drops the photo in his shirt pocket and pats it. 
GREG Safe keeping. 
Meanwhile, Nick's pocket video game emits an EXPLOSION NOISE. 
NICK Shit.  I'm out. 
He sets the game down, dejected. 
BENZ You guys going to Dante's after school? 
GREG I don't know. 
BENZ Check it out... 
Benz pulls a flyer from inside his coat.  It's an ad for a new game called "ARCADE", featuring a pair of evil eyes and glowing hands coming out of a circuit board.  The tag at the bottom reads, "COMING THIS FALL.  REALITY WILL NEVER BE THE SAME". 
NICK (excited) That's the new Slip-Stream game. Those guys are good.  It's supposed to be interactive. Graphics are unbelievable. 
BENZ Yeah?  They were handing these out at Dante's.  Test marketing it or something. Gonna have a demonstration today. 
STILTS Cool. 
LAURIE Can you say anything but "cool"? 
STILTS Of course I can.  I can say all sorts of things... 
GREG (annoyed) Guys... 
Benz pulls back the flyer and looks at it again. 
BENZ So how 'bout it? 
NICK I'm game... (to Greg) Greg? 
Greg turns to Alex. 
GREG Come on.  We'll hit Dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner. 
ALEX And then keep on driving? 
GREG Sure.  Never come back.  Disappear forever. 
LAURIE (nodding) I could go for that. 
Alex laughs.  Laurie took the words right out of her mouth. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- DAY 
Difford draws closer and indicates the machine behind him with a nod. 
DIFFORD (smooth as silk) We're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product.  We think it's going to be a big seller.  But you're the people that make it happen.  You're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at.  It's your opinion that's going to make or break us. 
NICK So what's so different about Arcade? You guys've been talking about it for months. 
Difford turns to Nick and salutes him. 
DIFFORD A man after my own heart.  Straight to the point. (to everyone) What's different about ARCADE is the way it reacts.  It responds like a human does.  It learns.  It adapts. Each time you play, it changes its strategy. 
NICK That's impossible. 
DIFFORD (taking the bait) Is it?  Why don't you see for your self? 
Difford reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a quarter.  He tosses it at... 
NICK 
who snags it out of mid-air and grins. 
GREG Go for it, Nick. 
Difford steps aside and waves Nick to the machine.  The rest of the kids crowd around. 
ARCADE 
isn't just your typical video game.  First of all there are three screens...front, left, and right...which provide a panoramic view while playing.  Second, the player wears "data gloves" (which provide an actual sensation of touch) and stereoscopic goggles which in turn are wired directly into the machine.  The results give the user the feeling that he/she has actually entered the video game universe. 
Difford thinks he has a hit on his hands, and his excitement shows. 
DIFFORD (indicating equipment) The CyberGloves are keyed into the game's response mechanism.  You'll be able to pick things up inside the world...tools, weapons ... it'll feel like they're really in your hands... 
Nick pulls on the gloves, securing them with velcro straps. 
DIFFORD (continuing) The goggles heighten the experience. When we said "Reality will never be the same", we weren't kidding. 
Difford places the goggles on Nick's face.  Then he points to the control board, which features two joy-sticks and a large RED BUTTON labeled "ESCAPE". 
NICK (skeptical) "Escape"? 
DIFFORD In case things get too intense.  It automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather.  Things can get pretty wild... 
BENZ (scoffing) Nick won't need it. 
DIFFORD You're good, eh? 
NICK (grins) The best. 
Nick winks at Alex and Greg. 
NICK (to Difford) So what's the scenario?  Am I saving a princess?  Fighting Zombies? 
DIFFORD It changes.  There are eleven levels. Each one is a different layer of the ARCADE universe.  The concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... ARCADE's brain. 
NICK So how do I start? 
DIFFORD The game will guide you. 
Nick turns back to the machine and pops the quarter into the coin slot. He punches the "START" button on the top of one of the joy-sticks. 
Immediately the screens come to life.  Darkness with shooting stars of light racing back and forth. 
ON SCREEN 
A three-dimensional computer-generated FACE appears out of the darkness, spinning in from far away and coming to rest. 
ARCADE I AM ARCADE. (breathing) YOU WANT TO PLAY GAMES?  YOU PICKED THE WRONG MACHINE. 
The crowd of kids is suitably impressed.  Even Alex is amused. So far, so good. 
ARCADE WHAT'S YOUR NAME? 
NICK Nick. 
ARCADE (almost contemptuous) NICK.  KISS REALITY GOODBYE. 
SUDDENLY, 
A LIGHTBEAM above the video screen illuminates Nick's face. 
LAURIE (concerned) What's it doing?! 
DIFFORD Memorizing Nick's features.  Watch. 
ON SCREEN 
GREG'S FACE 
As a smile slowly creeps across it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DANTE'S INFERNO - LATER 
At the front of The Inferno, Difford and two SLIP-STREAM HELPERS are unpacking cardboard boxes.  The KIDS have clustered around them, momentarily forgetting the ARCADE machine. 
Difford pulls cut a handful of game cartridges as well as goggles which dangle over his arm. 
DIFFORD Here's what we're going to do.  What I'm holding are the home versions of ARCADE, the prototypes... 
This is met with an enthusiastic response from the kids. 
DIFFORD (continuing) In a month or so we're planning on releasing ARCADE in both versions, but we're still fine tuning, and that's where you guys luck out.  So what we'll do is have you register with us, and then we're going to loan these out to you for a week or so.  The only thing you have to do in return is answer some marketing questions. Sound fair? 
The kids can't line up fast enough. 
OUR GROUP 
is right up front, with Nick and Alex being the first two in line. 
Difford winks at Nick. 
DIFFORD So what do you think? 
NICK Sign me up. 
Alex is glancing around now.  She sees Benz, Stilts, and Laurie, but not Greg. 
ALEX Where's Greg? 
Laurie jerks her thumb back at the ARCADE machine. 
LAURIE He's still working on the game. 
And Alex finds Greg for a moment, spotting him over the heads of the other kids. 
ON GREG 
His face is a mirror of Nick's...sweat pouring down, grinning from ear to ear.  It's addictive as hell.  SIGHTS and SOUNDS rush past us on the three screens, racing at incredible speeds. 
And now, from within the game, we hear a strange sound...a SCREAM of sorts, halfway between a shriek and a sonic boom. 
ARCADE TIME'S UP, FRIEND. 
The SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM reaches a nightmarish pitch and suddenly the screens EXPLODE WITH LIGHT. 
AT THE FRONT OF THE INFERNO... 
everyone turns in response.  It's as if someone set off a flashbulb. 
ALEX 
pushes her way back through the kids, making her way to the ARCADE machine. 
ARCADE 
Greg is nowhere to be found.  In fact, the CyberGloves and goggles are dangling from the control board, abandoned. 
Alex turns to a nearby KID. 
ALEX Where's Greg? 
The kid shrugs. 
KID Don't know.  I think I saw him walk out, but I'm not sure... 
Alex isn't listening anymore.  She's staring at the floor of the ARCADE machine. 
GREG'S POLAROID 
is on the floor...the photo of Greg and Alex which he manipulated. 
Alex picks it up, glancing around.  She scans the faces of the crowd and she doesn't see Greg anywhere.  She turns away. 
ON SCREEN 
A video figure is lying on the computer-generated ground. It sits up, brushing dust from itself, and looks around. It faces us.  Only the image isn't of Nick anymore.  It's VIDEO GREG now. 
UP FRONT, 
Alex has re-joined her friends.  The four of them are now clutching ARCADE home versions in their arms, CyberGloves and all.  They look like kids on Christmas Day. 
ALEX Dad...Dad... 
Jim stirs, though barely.  He turns a sleepy face towards her, looking gray and lifeless. 
JIM Yeah? 
ALEX Did Greg call, Dad? 
Jim shakes his head and sinks back into the couch. 
From Alex's attitude, it's obvious that this scene has played itself out many times before. 
ALEX You should go to bed, Dad. 
Jim waves a tired hand, dismissing her. 
JIM ...am in bed... 
ALEX (standing back up) Yeah. 
She turns and grabs a comforter that's bunched up at the end of the couch, spreading it over her father. 
ON THE T.V. 
We're getting a de-saturated view of carnage...some sort of war going on in some far-off land. 
Alex grabs the remote and flicks the t.v. off, plunging the room into darkness. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  ALEX'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
STATIC. 
Late-night t.v. static, filling up the entire screen. 
WE PULL BACK, 
revealing a television...and further back until we see Alex crouched behind it in silhouette.  She's fiddling with wires back there and... 
BLINK! Suddenly the SLIP-STREAM logo appears on the t.v. screen with nifty computer graphics.  She's just hooked up the home version of ARCADE.  Alex moves back to the front of the set. 
ALEX'S ROOM 
is her haven, a virtual library, filled with books which she loses herself in.  They're stacked everywhere. 
And puzzles too.  Half-assembled jig-saws.  Intricate things.  An Escher print.  The descendants of Rubik's Cube. Boxes within boxes.  This is Alex's life, what she retreats to. 
A PHOTO 
of Alex and her MOTHER sits by her bed, neglected and collecting dust. We'll see her later. 
CANDLES 
or what's left of them, have dripped and spread across her night table. 
ALEX 
sits at the foot of her bed, facing her television. Slowly, she draws on the CyberGloves, testing her fingers. Next, she pulls on the goggles. Instead of a control panel, the home version has a control box, complete with joy-stick and a mini "ESCAPE" button. 
Alex fingers the "START" button on top of the joy-stick. 
THE SCREEN 
goes black, black with intermittent sparks.  And the BREATHING begins. 
ARCADE'S FACE 
appears in the black, a pin-point at first, spinning round and round and growing larger.  It comes to a rest, eyes glowing. 
ARCADE (malevolent) HELLO, ALEX. 
Alex jumps back, dropping the control box.  ARCADE continues to BREATHE. 
ALEX How ... 
A thing BEAM OF LIGHT shoots from the ARCADE terminal, playing over Alex's face. 
ARCADE KISS REALITY GOODBYE. 
ON SCREEN 
ARCADE'S face spins away, to be replaced by a pixel-rendered image of Alex, dressed in battle gear. 
Video Alex sets her thrasher on the ground and mounts it. 
NICK (O.S.) (filtered) Hey, kid. 
Alex clutches the phone, still shaking. 
ALEX Nick... 
NICK  (O.S.) (filtered) Have you played the game yet?  It's incredible!  I was just... 
ALEX (cutting him off) Listen to me!  Greg never came home. I think the game has something to do with it. 
NICK (O.S.) (filtered) What the hell are you talking about? 
Alex continues to watch the television screen, almost mesmerized by the flickering sparks.  Her eyes begin to glaze over... 
NICK (O.S.) (filtered) You there?  Hello? 
Alex snaps out of it, tearing her gaze from the screen 
ALEX I have to talk to you. 
NICK (O.S.) (filtered) We are talking... 
ALEX No, in person.  Now. 
NICK (O.S.) (filtered) It's twelve-thirty! 
ALEX I'm coming over. 
Alex quickly hangs up the phone and moves back to the television.  She reaches for the control box and hits the "OFF" switch. 
Nothing happens.  Sparks continue to shoot across the screen. 
Alex tries it again.  Same result. 
ALEX Shit... 
Again and again she hits the button, but nothing is happening. 
Alex reaches behind the t.v., grabs hold of the electrical cords, and YANKS. 
The fucking cord won't come out! 
And then she hears it, an ELECTRONIC WHISPER, both seductive and horrific. 
ARCADE ALEX... 
With all her might, Alex pulls on the cords. POP!  They fling out of the t.v. and the screen goes dead. 
Alex sits back against the wall for a moment, catching her breath and trying to calm the rising hysteria within her. 
ALEX (to herself) Okay...don't think about it... (deep breath) Okay. 
Alex stands up, grabbing her coat off the bed. 
INT.  MANNING HOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Alex comes down the stairs, heading for the front door. Only she stops for a moment...noticing the LIGHT. 
ON THE COUCH, 
her father is once again bathed in the blue light of the television. STATIC WHISPERS, the same as before, are coming from the set. 
Alex looks at her father.  He hasn't moved.  And yet, the t.v. is on once again. 
THE SCREEN 
Blue static.  Unexceptional.  And a face?  Someone in the static? 
Alex draws closer to the screen.  She can hear SOMETHING now, other than static whispers.  Sounds kind of like a VOICE... 
THE SCREEN 
A definite, ghostly FACE is there.  It turns, looks at Alex (us) and it's Greg. 
GREG (on screen, strange) Alex... 
Alex jerks and SNAPS off the t.v., spooked as hell.  She stands in the darkness and all but runs out of the house. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  MANNING HOUSE - NIGHT 
Alex races to the Skylark and fumbles with the keys. Finally she gets it right, guns the gas, and rips out of the driveway. 
A STREETLIGHT 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  BENZ' HOUSE -- DAY 
Nick sits in the passenger seat of Greg's car, glancing across the street at... 
ALEX 
She's standing on the front porch of Benz' house, talking with his MOM. Mom is currently shaking her head.  Alex turns away and heads back towards Nick.  She comes around the Skylark and pulls open her door. 
NICK Well? 
ALEX She thought Benz was at school. 
Alex remains calm.  She sits for a moment, staring ahead. Finally she puts the key in the ignition. 
NICK Where to now? 
ALEX Laurie's. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  LAURIE'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Alex pulls the Skylark into Laurie's driveway.  The house is run down. You wouldn't want to live here.  Above, the sky has clouded over.  It looks like it's going to get nasty. 
ALEX Come on. 
Nick follows Alex to the front door and Alex hits the buzzer. 
ALEX (to herself) Laurie...answer...come on... 
Alex tries the buzzer again.  Persistently. 
ALEX Shit. 
Alex looks close to cracking.  There's a desperation in her face. 
ALEX This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what? 
NICK It doesn't necessarily mean she's... 
ALEX (cutting him off) Let's go around back. 
Before Nick can stop her, Alex is running around to the back. 
EXT.  LAURIE'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- DAY 
The backyard is in a sorry state, with junk strewn everywhere.  There's a cannibalized car, piles of scrap wood, and a swing-set that's hopelessly rusted. 
Alex winds her way to the back porch and a set of dusty glass doors.  She steps up and clears a spot to look through. 
ALEX (visibly relieved) She's here! 
Nick joins her at the window, peering inside. 
THEIR P.O.V. 
They are looking into a cluttered living room, dark except for the light that's issuing from the television.  The television faces away from us, but we can see Laurie, siting in front of it, mesmerized. 
LAURIE 
She looks like shit.  Wan, with sunken eyes and mussed up hair.  Mascara has run down her cheeks, and even now, tears are trickling from her eyes. Yet despite this, there's a dazed smile on her face.  We can't hear her, but she seems to be talking to the television. 
ALEX 
steps back a moment, concerned. 
ALEX It is the game. 
She taps on the window. 
ALEX Laurie! 
INSIDE, 
Laurie continues to watch the screen, oblivious to the rest of the world. 
Alex TAPS the harder, using her fist now. 
ALEX (louder) LAURIE! 
Nick joins Alex now, and the two of them are banging on the glass. There's no way in hell Laurie wouldn't be able to hear them. 
Alex steps back from the window again, panicking. 
Alex drops the remote, stunned. 
ALEX Oh God...  He's in the cable system! He's out of the game! 
Nick's eyes find the cable wire extending from the wall and into the t.v. Sure enough, SPARKS are crackling down that wire and into the wall. 
ARCADE LAUGHS and it's the most awful sound we've ever heard. 
LAURIE 
is convulsing now, and tiny SPARKS are racing around her eyes. 
Alex sees her and SCREAMS, clutching her hands to her ears in an attempt to block out the deafening ROAR. 
NICK 
moves without thinking, picking up a nearby chair and SLAMMING it into the television.  It EXPLODES glass, sparks, and smoke. 
The HUMMING stops altogether, quiet now.  And then, from everywhere at once... 
ARCADE SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. 
With a final ROAR, the energy behind the walls whips around and around, then rushes away. 
OUTSIDE, 
Nick catches a quick glimpse of SPARKS racing across the telephone wires suspended above the back yard. 
Total silence for a moment.  Alex and Nick are too stunned to speak.  Then Alex looks at Laurie. 
LAURIE 
lies on the ground, unconscious.  Glass scattered all around her. 
ALEX Laurie... 
Alex drops to her side, trying to find a pulse...anything. 
NICK Is she breathing? 
Alex nods. 
NICK Then leave her. 
ALEX We can't... 
NICK We'll call 911.  Look around Alex.  We broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here! 
Alex glances around.  The room is a mess.  All the outlet are singed.  And now she notices that everything electronic...t.v., clock, thermostat...all of them have exploded open. 
NICK (continuing) I believe you now.  I don't know what the fuck just happened, but it did. Now let's get the hell out of here. 
Alex slowly rises, reluctant to leave Laurie's side. 
ALEX Where do we go? 
NICK My house.  I want to try something. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  NICK'S HOUSE -- DAY 
As Alex and Nick pull up, the streetlights BUZZ on and off even though it's still daylight.  This doesn't escape Nick's notice. 
Alex parks the car and the two of them jump out. 
NICK Around back. 
EXT. NICK'S BACKYARD -- DAY 
Nick leads Alex to a cellar door and down inside. 
INT. NICK'S CELLAR -- DAY 
Rear the doorway is an old, paint-caked fuse box.  Nick pries it open and begins unscrewing fuses. 
NICK I'm not taking any chances. 
Nick steps back. 
NICK Okay.  I'm going inside.  If I'm not back out in, say, two minutes, you get the hell out of here. 
Alex nods.  She lifts her digital watch up and sets her timer with a BEEP. 
ALEX Meet you by the car. 
RECEPTIONIST May I help you? 
ALEX We need to see Mr. Difford. 
RECEPTIONIST I see.  And do you have an appointment? 
NICK No, but it's important and if you'd... 
RECEPTIONIST (cutting him off) I'm sorry, but if you don't have an appointment, I won't be able to help you. If you'd like, you can call his office from our courtesy phone outside and schedule one ... 
Nick reaches across the desk and snags the receptionist by his shirt, jerking him forward. 
NICK (menacing) If Difford's not out here it one minute we're calling the news and informing them that your fucking games are whispering in our ears and telling us to commit suicide. I'm talking public relations nightmare here, buddy.  Satanism, virgin sacrifices, backward messages, the whole bit. 
The receptionist glances at Alex who puts on a stern face and nods. 
Nick releases his grip.  The receptionist smooths out his shirt and smiles. 
RECEPTIONIST One moment please... (punches in extension) Rachel, would you be kind enough to tell Mr. Difford that we have a situation in the lobby which requires his immediate attention? (beat) Thank-you. 
The receptionist clasps his hands together and looks back up. 
RECEPTIONIST (continuing) Mr. Difford will be right with you. 
ALEX Why thank-you. 
Alex and Nick move away from the reception desk, having caused quite a scene.  The rest of the VISITORS watch them with curiosity. 
ALEX Virgin sacrifices? 
NICK (shrugs) Drives 'em crazy every time. 
Nick casts his eyes over the walls where graphics from various SLIP-STREAM games are displayed.  He stops on one display in particular, a triptych of sorts featuring the haunting face of ARCADE. 
BING! 
Alex and Nick turn at the sound, just in time to see Difford exiting an elevator and briskly making his way towards them. 
DIFFORD Nick, Alex, how are we today? 
ALEX How'd you know it was us? 
DIFFORD Security camera. (points to one) Pulled your files before I came down. Be careful what you say, kids ... I know where you live. 
Difford laughs and claps Nick on the back. 
DIFFORD (continuing) Now what seems to be the problem? 
ALEX It's the game, ARCADE. 
DIFFORD You don't like it? 
NICK That's gotta be the understatement of the century.  It's killing people. 
Beat.  Difford looks from Alex to Nick, and back again. His smile fades from his face. 
DIFFORD If this is a joke, I'm not laughing. 
ALEX Neither are we.  Something's wrong with the game, Mr. Difford. 
DIFFORD (clearing his throat) Why don't we take this into my office. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DIFFORD'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Difford closes the doors behind him.  He stares and Alex and Nick for a moment, assessing, calculating risks... 
DIFFORD Talk to me. 
ALEX There's something wrong with ARCADE. The game's alive somehow... 
At this Difford breaks into a smile.  Nick sees this and acts quickly to save the situation. 
NICK What Alex is trying to say is that it "seems" like it's alive. 
ALEX No I'm not... 
NICK (freezing her with a stare) We're not getting very far into the levels and we kind of thought maybe we could talk to a programmer, learn some tricks and stuff... (beat) I mean, you don't want us kids running around school saying your game's too hard, right? 
DIFFORD (relieved) That's what this is all about? Tricks? Sure, I'd be happy to introduce you to ARCADE's programmer. 
Alex has caught on.  She shuts up for the moment. 
DIFFORD (continuing) Tell you what, I'll take you down to our R&D labs right now. 
ALEX But how can it change every time? 
ALBERT It's the game's logic core.  We actually patterned it after human brainwaves.  I mean, there's a personality in there. That's what makes it so incredible. 
NICK How the hell did you do that? 
ALBERT Well, we're veering into classified info here, but I'll tell you that it involved a donor.  He was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening. 
At this, a chill runs down Alex's spine. 
ALEX Dead? 
ALBERT Well, brain-dead anyway.  Coma patient. It's really not all that important. 
ALEX Maybe he's not dead. 
ALBERT He? 
ALEX The donor.  Maybe he's alive inside the game. 
ALBERT (laughs) And maybe you've been taking too many drugs. 
Nick glances at the helmet again. 
NICK Could you play ARCADE with that? 
ALBERT Well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype. 
Nick nods and smiles, offering his hand. 
NICK Thanks, Albert.  Think you could print up those schematics? 
ALBERT Sure. 
Albert moves back to the computer console.  Meanwhile, Nick pulls Alex aside. 
NICK (quietly) Go outside, get your car, and meet me out front with the engine running. And make it quick, okay? 
ALEX What are you going to do? 
NICK Get that helmet.  If we're going to play ARCADE, I want every advantage possible. 
ACROSS THE LAB, 
Albert is oblivious to their conversation. 
Alex backs towards the lab doors, turns, and opens them.

INT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAY 
Alex makes her way quickly down the hall, turning a corner and passing a SECURITY GUARD.  She waves at him, her smile fading as soon as she's passed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. R&D LAB - DAY 
Albert is just pulling the last printed copy of the schematics from a laser printer.  He turns and hands them to Nick. 
ALBERT Here you go.  Happy hunting. 
Nick takes the schematics and tucks them inside his jacket. 
NICK Thanks again. 
And with that, Nick pulls back his fist and punches Albert square in the face. 
Albert goes down, more stunned than hurt, and Nick springs into action. He scoops up the CyberHelmet in his free hand, kicks open the doors, and tosses his skateboard into the hallway... 
INT. SLIP-STREAM HALLWAY - DAY 
Nick leaps on the board and starts pumping his foot like a bandit, picking up speed like mad... 
He's racing down the hallway, maneuvering between startled EMPLOYEES.  And here comes a MAN with a mail cart... 
WHOOSH!  Nick zips by him.  And now an ALARM is ringing. 
NICK Shit... 
INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY - DAY 
Nick comes SCREECHING around the corner, narrowly missing a collision with two SECURITY GUARDS. 
GUARD #1 That's him! 
NICK Jesus Christ! 
ALEX I can't believe you made it! 
Nick climbs into the front seat next to Alex, and for a second, he's pretty close to her.  He kisses her on the cheek...caught up in the moment.  Then he sinks back, catching his breath. 
ALEX You got the schematics? 
NICK Everything. 
Neither one speaks for a moment as the mood dampens once again.  Driving. Wind whipping Alex's hair around.  She stares at the road ahead. 
ALEX So where do we play the game, Nick? 
Nick doesn't answer at first.  For a second there, he'd managed to forget everything. 
NICK I've been thinking about that. (beat) ARCADE's like a virus, so it seems like the place to hit him would be where the virus started.  You know, like his point of origin? 
ALEX (grim) Dante's Inferno. 
NICK Yeah. (deep breath) The Inferno. 
OVERHEAD, 
as we watch Alex's Skylark speed away from us.  Shadows are creeping across the landscape now.  Streetlights are flickering, sputtering on. 
And night is falling. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT 
Sweeping down from the sky, we follow The Skylark.  As Alex and Nick near The Inferno, streetlights blink off in succession... progressive darkness working its way towards their destination. 
DANTE'S INFERNO 
We move past the painted walls, the various demons illuminated by moonlight. 
Alex and Nick rush to the front door.  It's gated.  Inside, The Inferno is totally dark.  Shadows. 
ALEX The windows are barred... (thinking) There's a skylight.  We can get in through the roof. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  DANTE'S INFERNO ROOF - NIGHT 
Alex and Nick creep over the roof, and sure enough, there's a skylight in the center, caked with grime. 
Nick stands and plants his foot through the skylight.  It SHATTERS, raining down glass into the darkness below. 
Nick pulls off his belt and hooks it around one of the iron sash bars. Gripping the belt, he lowers himself down. After a moment, he disappears from view. 
Alex leans over the skylight.  She can't see a thing. 
ALEX Nick... (beat) Nick! 
For the longest moment there's no response.  Then... 
NICK (O.S.) (from below) Okay, your turn. 
Alex climbs over and grasps the belt tightly, lowering herself down into The Inferno. 
INT.  DANTE'S INFERNO -- NIGHT 
Alex dangles from the skylight, a good eight feet from the floor. 
ALEX (warily) Are you there? 
HER P.O.V. 
The Inferno is a world of threatening shapes and shadows. And Nick is nowhere to be seen. 
Alex steels herself and drops to the floor. 
She stands, a bit shaky, and cautiously moves around a cluster of video games. 
NICK 
is standing on the other side, staring at a game screen which pulses with a DIM LIGHT. 
Alex approaches, putting a hand on his shoulder.  He turns. 
NICK Alex... 
ALEX You didn't hear me? 
NICK No.  If you're smart, you run like hell. 
Alex grabs a second quarter and shoves it in the coin slot. 
ALEX I'm going. 
Nick stares at her a moment, then nods tiredly.  She reaches for the second pair of CyberGloves and pulls them on. 
NICK You don't get it, do you? 
ALEX (strapping on goggles) What? 
NICK I don't want anything to happen to you.  I care about you. 
ALEX I already have a boyfriend, Nick. 
NICK I know. (beat) It sucks. 
The two of them stand there a moment, looking at one another.  After a moment, Nick laughs tiredly. 
NICK What can I say? (pulls on the CyberHelmet) Tough being a hero, isn't it? 
Nick reaches out for the joy-stick and hits the "START" button. 
NICK (grim) Here goes nothing. 
As before, the screen comes to life.  Darkness and sparks. Then we hear the BREATHING. 
ARCADE'S FACE 
spins into view, grinning at Alex and Nick. 
ARCADE NICK.  ALEX.  I MISSED YOU SO MUCH. ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE HERE. 
ALEX Fuck-you. 
ARCADE ANY TIME. 
ALEX We know what you are. 
ARCADE A HEARTLESS MONSTER, OF COURSE. (incredibly evil) OH SAVE ME, ALEX, SAVE ME FROM MYSELF. 
ARCADE laughs and it's not a sound you'd want to hear twice. 
THE LIGHTBEAM 
clicks on, playing over their faces and analyzing their features. 
ON SCREEN 
ARCADE'S face spins away and computer-generated versions of Alex and Nick appear.  As before, they are suited up in video game armor, each carrying a thrasher board. 
ARCADE KISS REALITY GOODBYE. 
The video versions of Nick and Alex hop onto their thrasher boards and the world around them curls in upon itself. 
The process is similar to what we've seen before, but even more extreme. LIGHTS and SOUNDS are pouring out of the ARCADE machine in almost unbearable intensities.  It seems as if the "real" world is going to be shaken apart. 
NICK (over noise) Hold on! 
ARCADE SEE YOU ON THE OTHER SIDE. 
ANOTHER FLASH OF LIGHT AND... 
Alex and Nick disappear from the real world completely. Their equipment, gloves and goggles, fall to the floor, empty.  They've been physically sucked inside the game! 
The light from the screen dies down now and everything is oddly quiet. 
ON SCREEN 
BOOM!  Suddenly a circuit grid is rushing up to meet them! 
(Note:  As we move through each level, video legends will appear on the screen as title cards, enhancing the effect that we are actually inside a video game.) 
The words "LEVEL ONE -- BLOOD RED SKY" flash across the screen and we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  LEVEL ONE, THE PLAINS -- DAY 
Alex and Nick slam into the ground like twin meteors, splashing up water and muck. 
THE RED SKY 
crackles with LIGHTNING.  Smoke obscures everything. Alex and Nick pull themselves up, a bit dazed. 
NICK And we've still got time left.  This was a piece of cake. 
ALEX Yeah, that's what worries me. 
She steps through the doorway and disappears.  Nick follows. 
We hold on the empty doorway.  Hold for a moment, and then... 
We hear a distant, high-pitched RINGING.  It's grating, seeping inside our brains and mucking around in there.  On the horizon there is a quick FLASH OF LIGHT. 
Something is coming. 
CUT TO: 
The words "LEVEL TWO -- DEADLANDS" 
EXT.  LEVEL TWO, SALT FLATS -- DAY 
Alex and Nick are cruising along salt flats.  Sporadic pools of water and strange ROARING sounds in the mist.  So far so good. Nick glances at his wrist display.  His "STRENGTH" only has a few blocks left. 
NICK Hey, my strength's low.  Look out for Fireflies. 
ALEX There... 
She points North.  A small BALL OF LIGHT is streaking across the sky, just above the watery plains. 
Alex and Nick swerve towards it, gaining ground.  As they near it, Nick swings out his hand, scooping the Firefly up. As soon as he touches it, it bursts like a bubble. 
NICK Shit... 
ALEX Check your read-out. 
Nick does.  His "STRENGTH" is back to normal again. 
NICK You're right.  It worked. 
Nick and Alex slow their boards to a stop, stepping off them. 
ALEX (pointing) There's another... 
She sweeps left and scoops the second Firefly out of the sky.  Off in the distance we can hear that RINGING again, just at the edge of our vision. Alex and Nick don't hear it yet. 
Nick is glancing down at his schematic of Level Two. 
NICK According to this, the doorway should be somewhere around here... 
THEIR P.O.V. 
The salt flats have gradually diminished, replaced by more and more water. Ahead of them, there's no longer anything solid to stand on...just water, muck, and strange reeds poking through the mist. 
Alex's wrist display begins to BEEP.  She glances down. 
WRIST DISPLAY 
Only one block of time remains and it's pulsing on and off. The RINGING is a little louder now. 
ALEX (worried) Our time's up. 
NICK What?!  There's nothing here! 
ALEX Look around... 
The two of them stumble through the water, not even sure of what they're looking for. 
NICK (starting to panic) I don't see the doorway! 
Alex and Nick's wrist displays are BEEPING like crazy now. The beeps come closer and closer until they meld into one piercing high-pitched TONE. 
JUST THEN, 
the RINGING turns into the SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM of the Screamer.  A burst of light on the horizon shatters the sky. 
NICK What the fuck is that?! 
ALEX Screamer. 
ALEX 
plunges into the marsh-like water, waist-high, and it's then that she sees a glow emanating from beneath the water. She dives forward... 
BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE BRACKISH WATER 
Alex swims towards the GLOW.  Ahead of her, the depths drop off sharply, perhaps some hundred feet or so. 
HER P.O.V. 
Nick heaves himself up into a standing position and looks around.  They are on the top of a massive dune. 
THEIR THRASHER BOARDS 
now looks like snowboards.  It doesn't take Nick long to figure out what to do. 
NICK We can take the dunes down like a ski slope. Pretend you're on a snowboard. 
ALEX (snapping down her visor) Never been on a snowboard. 
Nick steps on the board and edges it over the crest of the dune.  He begins to slide down, slowly picking up speed. 
A SERIES OF SHOTS... 
...as Alex and Nick negotiate the dunes.  They glide over the sand gracefully, cutting back left and right to keep their speed down, sweeping in wide arcs... 
Under any other circumstances, they'd be having the time of their lives. Alex has adjusted to the environment quickly, at ease of the Thrasherboard. 
LATER -- 
The dunes gradually level out.  Alex and Nick slow to a stop. Alex flips up her visor.  Her face is covered with grime now, hardened. 
ALEX I guess we're walking from here on out. 
They pick up their boards and walk. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  LEVEL THREE, DESERT -- LATER 
Alex and Nick have been walking for a long time.  Nick is silent, just staring straight ahead at the endless sand. He looks wasted.  Zoned out. His face is beaded with sweat. 
Once again, their wrist displays begin to BEEP. 
ALEX (almost a whisper) Time's up. 
Nick starts to LAUGH, sinking to his knees. 
NICK We're fucked.  That's it. 
Alex pulls on Nick's arm, forcing him to his feet. 
ALEX Get up, Nick... 
Nick isn't going anywhere fast.  Alex tries to drag him forward, but she slips in the sand. 
ALEX GET UP!!! 
And then, from off in the distance... 
VOICE (O.S.) (far away) Alex...help me... 
Alex turns.  She focuses on the horizon and sees a tiny speck.  She taps a control on her helmet and her view is magnified. 
ALEX'S P.O.V. 
Benz is up ahead. buried up to his waist in the blue sand and sinking quickly.  He waves his hands for help. and clutched in one of them is the second key. 
ALEX It's Benz!!! 
Alex breaks into a run, and after a moment, Nick follows. He's walking, though...in no hurry to reach Benz. 
ON BENZ 
The desert is swallowing him up.  Only his head and arms remain.  He's in a state of total panic. 
BENZ (terrified) Get me out of here!  Oh God!!! 
ALEX 
is running at top speed, half-stumbling across the dunes. Her wrist-display is BEEPING furiously. 
BENZ 
His head starts to disappear beneath the sand and his cries are choked off. 
ALEX Benz! 
Alex reaches the spot and now, only Benz' clutched fist remains.  The hand opens and the gold key falls onto the sand. 
Alex DIVES for Benz' hand, but it sinks just before she can reach it.  She SCREAMS and claws at the sand, trying to find him.  She digs and digs, but all she finds is more sand.  With each second she becomes more frantic. 
Finally Alex stops, noticing the key and idly picking it up. 
THE SAND 
the mirror shows her own reflection, rushing closer.  Her wrist display indicates that time is up with a prolonged BEEP and her own reflection vanishes.  It's the Screamer in her reflection's place.  Only it's rocketing towards her in the mirror.  It's in front of her this time, instead of behind her. 
Rock and a fucking hard place.  Light streaks or Screamers? 
It's really no choice at all.  Her guts says "Screamer". 
Alex leaps and SMASHES into the mirror at full speed.  The world is filled with SHATTERING GLASS and a shower of infinite reflections and then we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  LEVEL SEVEN, PIER -- DAY 
The sound of SHATTERING GLASS carried through as Alex EXPLODES out of the sky.  And it's the sky itself that seems to be shattering... 
Title reads "LEVEL SEVEN -- SEA OF DARKNESS" 
ALEX 
continues her fall.  She lands hard.  No blue desert sand to cushion her here.  It takes her a moment to rise... 
Alex is on a slat-board pier extending out into a sea of black water.  The shore is completely desolate with the exception of the pier.  Storms clouds have gathered above, and if you've seen a storm blowing in on the open sea, you know what it looks like... 
...the and of the world.  A strange and scary yellow/green sky presses down on us.  It's a hurricane sky.  The calm before the storm. 
ON THE HORIZON, 
TWO CITIES can be seen.  Techno-cityscapes, angular and metallic-looking, towers jutting up from the sea like knives. 
AT THE END OF THE PIERS 
are two boats.  Standing in them are two pale-faced, cloaked FIGURES. Like Charon, the boatman on the river Styx. 
Somewhere off in the distance, the RINGING can be distinctly heard now. But Alex is preoccupied now.  As she moves down the pier, recognition dawns on her. 
It's Laurie and Stilts.  They are dressed completely in black, hair slicked back and eyes empty.  White-faced Gothic harlequins.  Each is holding a wooden staff, staring into space. 
ALEX Guys!  Oh my God... 
Alex rushes forward, excited, but as she sees their faces excitement fades.  A chill wind picks up and the sea laps at the pier like a metronome, lulling the world into stillness. 
ALEX (unsure) Laurie?  Stilts? 
Neither of them acknowledges Alex with their eyes. 
STILTS (like ARCADE) You may ask one of us a question. One tells the truth, and the other lies. Who you ask, remains your discretion. But if the answer is wrong, the questioner dies. 
Laurie motions to the techno-cities behind her. 
LAURIE (like ARCADE) One of these cities, is the place you seek. The Teller of Truths will take you there. But the City of Lies, is dark and bleak. And death is certain if you enter, beware. 
STILTS I am The Liar.  Where should I take you? 
LAURIE I am the Truth Teller.  Where should I take you? 
Alex stares at them a moment, utterly confused.  The sky above darkens, and the wind picks up.  She looks to the horizon, from one city to another, then back at her friends. 
ALEX (horrified) What did he do to you? 
LAURIE Is that your question? 
ALEX (realizing) Wait!  No!  That's not it! 
BEEP! BEEP! BEEP!  Alex doesn't even need to look at her wrist display anymore.  She begins to pace on the end of the pier, nervously glancing at the horizon.  And yes, there's the FLASH followed by the SHRIEK/SONIC BOOM. 
ALEX (to herself) Think!  I want to go to the City of Truth, and the Truth Teller is from there...but which one is which?  The liar...think! 
LAURIE You have no time.  What is your question? 
ALEX (snapping back) I'm thinking! 
LAURIE You have no time. 
THE SCREAMER 
is visible now, arms opening to engulf Alex.  Talk about pressure. 
ALEX (she stops pacing) The liar...Truth Teller...liar...liar... 
Alex rushes over to Stilts. 
ALEX Liar.  Did you come from the city on the left, or the city on the right? 
STILTS (pointing) I came from the city on the left. 
ALEX (grins) But you always lie, so you didn't come from there.  That means the city on the left must be the City of Truth. 
She fingers the throttle and the cycle ROARS to life.  It rockets off the incline and down into the tunnels. 
A SERIES OF SHOTS 
as Alex maneuvers the cycle through a forest of concrete. It's a harrowing ride, as her headlight reveals little of what's up ahead.  Somewhere above the tunnels, the Screamer has arrived.  In the course of the chase, it's SHRIEK will become louder and louder as it draws closer, locating Alex. 
ANOTHER CYCLE 
appears out of side tunnels and a chase is on.  The RIDER is dressed in black with glowing death's head masks. 
BOY (to Alex) Dark Riders!  If they touch us, we're dead! 
The tunnels get narrower and narrower, as Alex keeps pushing the limit off the bike. 
Rider #1 tries to cut Alex off, charging forward and ramming her bike... 
Alex almost loses it, but finds balance once again, sweeping left and up the side of a circular tunnel... 
RIDER #1 
bites it.  His cycle careens into the wall and EXPLODES in a shower of GREEN LIGHT.  The death's head tumbles away, spinning end over end.  The Screamer BLASTS over the remains of the Rider, having entered the tunnels. 
TWO MORE RIDERS APPEARS 
gaining on Alex.  Rider #2 pulls a staff from his back and thrusts it forward like a lance.  CHINK!  The staff hits Alex's rear wheel, nearly throwing her.  The rider pulls off a gloved and reaches a glowing, skeletal hand towards them.  Death touch.  The boy SCREAMS in terror. 
UP AHEAD, 
a wall is rushing to meet them.  Alex jams the breaks and slides/skids sideways, cutting right at the last possible moment... 
WHAM!!!  Rider #2 slams into the end wall, not able to negotiate the turn. Another EXPLOSION of green and the second death's head comes tumbling away. 
Alex looks back.  There should be one Rider left, only now their are three!  Alex guns the bike and cuts sharply to the right... 
NEW TUNNEL -- 
Alex SCREECHES to a stop, having found yet another fork. The tunnel branches off into two directions.  Two neon signs with arrows point in opposite directions. 
NEON SIGNS 
They read, "THIS WAY" and "THAT WAY". Alex checks her wrist display.  Not much time left. 
ALEX Which way? 
BOY (pointing) That way. 
Alex backs up the cycle and heads down the tunnel marked "THIS WAY" instead. 
ALEX Sorry. 
THE TUNNEL 
It narrows almost immediately.  Alex hears a ROAR, glances behind her, and sees four death's head RIDERS on her tail. She makes another turn... 
AHEAD, 
is a crumbling brick wall with the words "WRONG WAY" painted in blood-red. 
BOY (screaming) It's the wrong way! 
ALEX (over the noise) In this world, wrong is right! 
SUDDENLY, 
the tunnel behind them flares with light, shaking like an earthquake.  The Screamer has found them. 
A KEY 
hangs out from the wall, sort of like the brass ring on a merry-go-round. Alex snags it as she sweeps by. 
THE SCREAMER 
rockets around the corner, twisting down the narrow tunnel. 
Alex grinds the motorcycle forward for all it's worth, and the Screamer is literally breathing down her neck.  She turns corner after corner, faster and faster, scraping the bike into the scum-covered walls and shooting out showers of SPARKS.  If she takes one second too long to negotiate a turn, pauses for even an instant, the Screamer will be on them... 
A CLAWED HAND 
lashes out and tears away the cycle's tail-pipe.  Another hand takes out a chunk of the seat... 
THE BOY 
is WAILING, curling low to avoid the Screamer's claws... 
AHEAD, 
ALEX Mom? (uncomprehending) You're alive... 
ALEX'S MOTHER Of course I am. 
ALEX But I don't understand... 
ALEX'S MOTHER I miss you so much, Alex.  I want so much to be with you... 
Tears are running freely down Alex's face now. 
ALEX'S MOTHER (continuing) I love you, Alex.  I never wanted to leave. You know that, don't you? 
ALEX (nodding) Yes...but...how did you... 
Her mother looks ecstatic.  And now there are tears in her eyes.  Joy, reunion...it's unclear which. 
ALEX'S MOTHER Magic.  We'll be together again. (beat) I know you don't believe in an afterlife, but there is one.  Heaven is real. 
Alex looks around her.  It's all too much to take in.  Her mother.  Back in her own home.  Sunlight is streaming in, bathing everything around her in gold and the moment is crystallized.  A still-life.  Forever. 
ALEX Is...is that where we are?  Did I die? 
ALEX'S MOTHER Not yet, honey... 
Her mother stands and Alex sees that she is holding a gun...no, the gun, in her hands.  She raises at Alex. 
ALEX'S MOTHER (continuing) ...but I can fix that. 
Alex has no time to respond.  A still-born scream is frozen in her throat. A split-second of realization.  And then her mother FIRES the gun... 
CRACK!  The bullet hits Alex square in the forehead, snapping her head back as an are of blood and brain matter trail outward.  The world spins to a stop, like a record player running down. 
Alex is killed instantly.  Her body collapse, head thumping unceremoniously against the carpeted floor. 
HER EYES 
open and fixed on infinity.  No life here.  Seems hard to believe that there ever was. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LEVEL NINE, THE NIGHT ROOM -- 
ON ALEX'S FACE 
There is no bullet-hole in her forehead, but her eyes are just as lifeless. 
THE PEANUT GALLERY 
Row after row of frozen faces.  Are they aware that Alex has died?  Is there consciousness inside those skulls? 
ON ARCADE 
as he crouches over Alex's body.  A smile creeps across his face. 
ARCADE OH ALEX.  SO SORRY.  BUT DON'T YOU WORRY, I'LL BRING YOU BACK IN THE GAME.  MAYBE I'LL EVEN GIVE YOU HEAVEN. 
He laughs. 
ALEX'S BODY 
begins to decompose in front of us, skin sinking in and shriveling up.  In moments, she's just a husk. 
ARCADE rears back, and is about to turn away, when something catches his eye.  He hears a tiny BEEPING. 
ALEX'S WRIST MONITOR 
Remember the stylized symbol of a woman?  The one that said "FREE LIFE" beneath it?  Well it disappears now. 
There's a sudden FLASH behind ARCADE and he spins around.. 
ANOTHER ALEX 
is standing behind him. and she's got the heart/sword in her hands! 
ALEX Guess what, ass-hole?  You forgot about my free life!!! 
She DIVES forward, thrusting the sword with all her might. It sinks into ARCADE'S chest and she pushes further, burying it up to the hilt. 
ARCADE lets loose the most terribly SCREAM we've ever heard.  It literally shakes world. 
THE SWORD 
is glowing like molten lava.  The heart-shaped hilt burns into the monster's chest, spreading crackling fire over his entire body.  His body is immersed fire now, vibrating like mad and suddenly... 
...ARCADE EXPLODES IN A FIREBALL OF GREEN LIGHT AND...

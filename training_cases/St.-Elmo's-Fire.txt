LESLIE Not everybody got recruited out of school into international banking, 'moneybags.' 
ALEC Besides... My mom and dad gave us this car. I think I was conceived in the back seat. 
KEVIN It's still sticky. 
WENDY Oh, God. Wait 'til my father hears the car is totalled. 
BILLY I'm gonna get you a new car, Wendy. Everyone screams in disbelief as they go into St. Elmo's. Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin holds the door open, but no one thanks him. 
KEVIN You're welcome. You're welcome. A young, burned-out UNDERGRAD (CLAYTON) follows. 
KEVIN You're not welcome, Clayton. How's school? 
CLAYTON Baroque. Thank you very much. How's life after school?

ALEC Wally! You let undergrad punks at our tables??? 
WALLY Relax, Alec... they've only been there ten minutes. 
ALEC Yeah, well, we've been here for four years. Alec, Leslie, Jules, Wendy, Kevin and Billy (still with sax around his neck) take their usual chairs as Kirbo drops off a large pitcher of beer. 
BILLY Hey, I need a real drink. Kirbo is long gone. Kevin pours. 
KEVIN Waiters are like cops. Never around when you need one. Kevin and Alec begin bouncing quarters from the edge of a table into their beers -- obviously some ritual.

KIRBO And having the right girl smile at you. She has the whitest teeth I've ever seen. "RHAPSODY IN BLUE" fills the room. Kevin begins gathering up his endless pieces of paper, notes, etc. 
KEVIN If you think I'm going to live through another year of finding poorly written, unmailed love scratchings around this apartment. 
KIRBO I found her again. It's fate. It's true love. I have her hospital schedule! 
KEVIN Love is just an illusion created by lawyer-types like yourself to perpetuate another illusion called marriage to create the reality of divorce and the illusory need for divorce lawyers. Did you know there are more people in law school right now than there are lawyers on the planet? 
KIRBO You're just bitter, 'cause you haven't had sex for a long time.

.LESLIE I did all the mechanicals for one of our senior architects and I think he's going to promote me to the design staff. Kevin is fighting with a ridiculous wine opener. 
KEVIN Maybe you could design a corkscrew that actually works. Everything in this apartment comes from Scandinavia. They don't even have wine in Scandinavia. Naturally Leslie opens it in a flash. 
KEVIN Do you think my attachment to Alec is unnatural? 
LESLIE No, I think mine is. We've only just started to live together and he's already pushing for 'the wedding.'

LESLIE You must have been in love, once. You like hot peppers? 
KEVIN Doesn't Alec hate them? 
LESLIE Insurrection... Now, come on, Kevin, you must have been in love with somebody, sometime... 
KEVIN Once, in junior high. I played guitar in a group and fellin love with our singer who did 'We've Only Just Begun' as sweet as Karen Carpenter. I got high on cheap champagne and pledged my love. Next day she ran off with the bass player named Rocky and I traded my guitar in for a battered Underwood typewriter.

DALE And here's the worst of all... When I first decided to be a doctor, I thought it was because I wanted to serve people. But now, well, I'm beginning to get this funny feeling that what medicine's really all about is money... You want some coffee? 
MIRBO It's money, isn't it? That's what you're trying to tell me. It's 'cause I don't have any money! Thank you for being so honest. He gets up and leaves.

ALEC On June first. Leslie will do me the long-awaited honor of becoming my bride. You're all invited. Everyone rushes to Leslie, who is stunned.

ALEC What'd you tell her?... Little buddy... little traitor. Huh, what'd you tell her? 
LESLIE He told me nothing. It was just a hunch... until now. Alec filled with guilt and remorse becomes angrier. Alec realizes that everybody in the house is watching him. He must save face. 
ALEC Leslie, I want you out of the apartment tonight. Alec marches out the door. The place is a wreck. 
Kirbo drives frantically. As snowflakes begin to hit the windshield, he grabs for the windshield wiper. Not knowing how it works, he forces it the wrong way. The handle comes off in his hand.

LESLIE Alec was the first. There were other guys, in high school, boys -- but he was the first love of my life. I always wondered if Alec and I hadn't ended up in the same dorm -- well, I guess I would have just found someone else. And so would he. 
KEVIN Alec had the luck of geography. Whatever we say about Alec we'll regret tomorrow. 
LESLIE What do you think about our relationship. as an outsider? 
KEVIN Oooo -- dangerous question. 
(BIG SLUG) Sometimes I think I just hang around with you and Alec 'cause. well, since he introduced me to you...

S It is tomorrow. There is a mad moment of hesitation and then Kevin and Leslie smash into each other's arms. 
KEVIN I love you... I've always loved you. They kiss madly, passionately. They fall to the floor in a frenzy. Leslie pulls Kevin's hair. 
KEVIN Aaaaah. Ouch... (as she stops) No. I love it. I love it!!! Leslie grabs onto the large throw rug as they roll around the floor. Somehow as they roll and turn, the rug gets wrapped around them. Leslie tears at his shirt, as he yanks her sweater off. Kevin fights madly with the back of Leslie's bra. He is going berserk trying to find the clasp. 
LESLIE No... it's in front. With a flick of her hand she undoes her bra and opens up the wonders of paradise to her old buddy. They kiss madly again as they roll in the rug.

MR. BEAMISH Good... so you like the car? 
WENDY It's a great car, Dad, but I can't keep it. I don't feel right about driving a car like that and working with people who can't afford to eat. She finds the keys and hands them to him. 
MR. BEAMISH Keep the car... you and Howie are going to need it. 
WENDY I'm giving Howie back, too.

ALEC No more albums! That's it... Get your clothes and give me the keys. Leslie reluctantly hands him the keys and moves toward the bedroom closet slowly.

KEVIN I'm sure I'll be back doing obits tomorrow. 
LESLIE Oh, no. You're going to really attract some attention with this... 
(LAUGHING) Did somebody actually say 'I believe in the golden rule, whoever's got the gold makes the rule'? 
KEVIN Sort of. Leslie, I couldn't write anything of any meaning until you. He kisses her warmly. 
LESLIE Kevin. He aggressively gets on top of her, and feeling the excitement and the champagne kisses her madly. The front door opens and Jules appears breathless. 
JULES Don't you two ever use a bed? Leaving the door wide open, she races through the apart- ment. Kevin continues to madly attack Leslie when Ron, carrying packages, arrives at his door across the hall. He and Kevin exchange a look as-Ron goes inside. 
LESLIE Let me show Jules your piece.

LESLIE I'm sorry to bother you here. It's Jules. After she left for work this morning, the finance company came and took away all her furniture, her Jeep, everything they could get their hands on... I couldn't reach her so I finally went over to her office. Alec -- she was fired three weeks ago! All this time, she's been pretending to go to work every day , and pretending to be still having this affair with her boss. And she's been doing a lot of coke .. Well, anyway, I confronted her at the apartment, and at first she denied everything, but then she went crazy -- and now she's locked herself in the apartment and she won't let me back in... I'm really worried about her. Alec hesitates angrily.

161 INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY 161 
ALEC Jules, remember my junior year when I went cold turkey on cigarettes? You sat up with me all night in the commons room feeding me emergency carrots...? No answer. 
LESLIE Jules, if you don't let us in, we're going to have to call the police. There is a beat and then Jules speaks from the depths of hell. 
JULES (O.S.) I'll throw myself out the window before they get through the door. 
LESLIE Not my greatest ploy. 
ALEC Jules, remember the time I flunked art history and I was trying to drink myself to death... Kevin and Kirbo come dashing up the stairs breathlessly. 
KIRBO How is she? 
ALEC After all I've done for you. 
KEVIN I feel I've done a lot for you, too, Al... so pull me up and we'll call it even. 
ALEC What you did for me was take the woman I was going to marry. The woman he was going to marry arrives frantically onto their landing. She struggles with Alec. 
LESLIE Alec, stop it right now! Below them, Billy and Kirbo pull up in a Chevron tow truck. Billy, wearing Chevron coveralls, jumps out with an acetylene torch in hand, shouting.

KIRBO Hey! Help. Kevin goes down the fire escape to help him, leaving Alec and Leslie alone. Leslie kneels by the window with her hands on the iron bars and speaks to Jules. 
LESLIE Oh, my God. Jules, please, it's so cold. 
ALEC Very noble how you ran up here to save your lover. 
LESLIE He's not my lover. Jules, listen...

LESLIE I have never lied to you once since the day I met you... you cocky shithead.

170 CONTINUED: 170 Alec knows it's the truth. 
LESLIE Hang on, Jules. We all love you. She has been holding onto the bars with her bare-hands, but the bitter cold makes her wince as she removes her hands. Alec is overwhelmed with feelings as he takes her hands and holds them to his mouth, breathing warm breath onto them. Much emotion passes between them. 
LESLIE Your breath, your breath is so sweet. 
ALEC. Leslie, I'm sorry. I'm so profoundly sorry. Kirbo and Kevin arrive. Billy races down the alley. 
KIRBO Blowtorch, anyone? 
ALEC Give it to me.

SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN: INT. ANTEROOM CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD 
Two telephone operators sit at switchboard busy plugging in and out answering calls. 
1ST OPERATOR This is the Morning Post... The City Room? Just a moment, I'll connect you. (plugs in call) 
2ND OPERATOR Morning Post... Sports Department? Just a moment -- (plugs in call) 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to disclose the rest of the anteroom. To Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it again from the city room which stretches on beyond switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock. 
CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY 
as he bends over paper. We catch a glimpse of the squares of a crossword puzzle. 
MED. SHOT 
as a reporter comes out of the City Room, clanging gate to behind him. The office boy looks up. 
OFFICE BOY What's a seven-letter word for --? 
REPORTER Don't ask me! If I knew any seven- letter words, I'd be something better than a reporter! 
He catches a glimpse of the far elevator going down. 
REPORTER Hey! Down! Down! 
MED. SHOT ELEVATORS 
as reporter runs in to the closed elevator door and pounds on it. It comes back, the door opens, and he gets in. The door closes, as elevator goes down. The near elevator comes up and discharges Hildy Johnson and Bruce Baldwin. Bruce carries an umbrella and wears a raincoat. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT TABLE 
office boy looking over his puzzle as Hildy and Bruce come into the scene. 
HILDY (with a smile) Hello, Skinny. Remember me? 
OFFICE BOY (looks up; then a glowing smile) Hildy Johnson! 
CLOSE SHOT SWITCHBOARD 
Hildy approaches the switchboard. 
HILDY (to operator) Hello, Maisie. 
The first operator looks up. 
MAISIE Hello -- Hildy! You coming back? 
HILDY No, just visiting. Tell me, is the lord of the universe in today? 
MAISIE He is -- and in a very bad humor. I think somebody stole one of his crown jewels. Shall I announce you? 
HILDY No, never mind -- I'll blow my own trumpet. 
THREE SHOT BRUCE, HILDY AND OPERATOR 
Hildy turns to Bruce. 
HILDY I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you. 
BRUCE Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you. 
We hear a giggle off scene. 
CLOSE SHOT OFFICE BOY 
He looks towards Bruce and Hildy and giggles. 
TWO SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY 
HILDY What did you say, Bruce? 
Bruce, embarrassed, looks at the office boy, then looks back at Hildy as they turn toward second gate leading into City Room. 
BRUCE I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you. 
HILDY Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling. 
BRUCE (grimly) I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you? 
HILDY My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it. 
BRUCE I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here. 
HILDY I'll come a-running, pardner. 
She starts to push open the iron-grilled gate leading into the City Room. Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it for her. Hildy smiles. 
HILDY Thanks, Bruce. 
She kisses his cheek and walks through. He looks after her. The office boy whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares after Hildy. 
MEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOM 
Hildy starts to walk through City Room. 
TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY 
as she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk, because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor. The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of: "Hildy!" "Hello, Hildy", etc., from the men as Hildy goes straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own greetings: "Jim!" "Hi, good-looking!" "Laura" "Hullo, Pop" "Nan!" "Eddie!" "Hello, Mac" "Pete!" "Frank" "Oscar!", and gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him as she goes by. He turns around: "Say, who did that?" As he sees Hildy: "Hello, Hildy!" Hildy: "Hi, Jake." She passes a middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back. 
HILDY Hello, Beatrice. How's "Advice to the Lovelorn"? 
BEATRICE (looking up) Hildy! I'll be a monkey's uncle! What are you doing here? 
HILDY Point of information -- what does a girl say on meeting her divorced husband? OR: (What does a girl do, etc.) 
BEATRICE (illustrating) My advice is duck and cross with your right. 
Hildy moves on. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER to the end of the room where she pauses before the frosted glass partition which separates Walter Burns' office from the rest of the City Room. 
INT. BURNS' OFFICE LONG SHOT 
BURNS (growling) I notice you still remember it. 
HILDY I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you. 
BURNS You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it. 
HILDY Done what? 
BURNS Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted. 
HILDY Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for. 
BURNS Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change. 
HILDY I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker. 
BURNS Now, that's a nice thing to say. 
HILDY Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works? 
BURNS Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
HILDY A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write: (she gestures above to indicate sky- writing) 'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it. 
BURNS Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up. 
HILDY What home? 
WALTER What home? Don't you remember the home I promised you? 
HILDY Oh, yes -- we were to have it right after our honeymoon -- honeymoon! 
BURNS Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did. 
HILDY All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you? 
BURNS Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story. 
HILDY Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm -- 
BURNS Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again. 
HILDY What?!! 
BURNS I haven't any hard feelings. 
HILDY Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for? 
BURNS (rising, reaching for his hat) Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything. 
HILDY (also rising) I have a lunch date. I just want -- 
BURNS You can break it, can't you? 
HILDY No, I can't. 
BURNS Sure you can. Come on. 
DIFFERENT ANGLE 
HILDY Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss. 
BURNS What do you mean by that? 
HILDY Just what I said. That's what I -- 
BURNS You mean you're not coming back to work here? 
HILDY That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I -- 
BURNS (still interrupting) You've had a better offer, eh? 
HILDY You bet I've got a better offer. 
BURNS Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for -- 
HILDY I know, Walter, but I -- 
BURNS (ignoring her) What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg -- 
HILDY You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced! 
BURNS Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering. 
HILDY Listen, Walter -- 
BURNS (going right on) I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us. 
HILDY Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter. 
WIDER ANGLE 
BURNS It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything. 
HILDY (indignantly) I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you! 
BURNS Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you! 
HILDY (speechless) You -- you -- 
She grabs something and chucks it at him. He ducks. The phone rings. 
BURNS (to Hildy) You're losing your eye. You used to be able to pitch better than that. (he reaches for phone) Hello... Yeah... What? Sweeney? Well, what can I do for you? 
CLOSE SHOT DUFFY 
seated at his desk, talking into phone. 
DUFFY What's the matter with you? Are you drunk? This is Duffy, not Sweeney! 
CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY 
Burns into phone: 
BURNS Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to. (he hangs up) How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day. 
HILDY What's the matter? 
BURNS Sweeney. 
HILDY Dead? 
BURNS Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby! 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY 
BURNS Then what does he want with you? 
HILDY (laughing) Now you got me. 
BURNS Nothing personal. I was just asking. 
At the door, Burns walks ahead, opens door and walks out. 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BURNS' OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS 
BURNS After all -- 
He stops as he realizes she's not there. The door opens. Hildy comes out. 
HILDY You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me. 
BURNS (incredulous) No kidding? 
INT. CITY ROOM FULL SHOT 
Reporters conversing. They stop as Hildy and Burns enter scene. 
TRUCKING SHOT 
as Hildy follows Burns through the City Room. This time, in contrast to Hildy's original walk through the room, the groups are silent as they watch the two. 
HILDY (trying to keep pace) And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady. 
BURNS (over his shoulder) What for? 
HILDY (shouting) And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her! 
BURNS (stops) Oh, I'm sorry. 
Burns, at this point, has reached the switchboard. He says, under his breath, to Maisie: 
BURNS (under his breath) Have Duffy call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes. 
Hildy, a little out of breath, catches up with him. At the iron gate that opens into anteroom Hildy jumps ahead, opens the gate and holds it for Burns. 
HILDY Allow me. 
BURNS (walking right through) Thanks. 
Hildy follows him out. 
INT. ANTEROOM MED. SHOT 
as Hildy follows Burns in. Bruce is sitting on the bench. On the end of a bench sits an old, grizzled Western Union "boy". Ignoring Bruce, Burns strides over to the "boy", seizes his hand, shakes it and says: 
BURNS I can see right away my wife picked out the right husband for herself. 
CLOSE SHOT BRUCE 
Hildy behind him. Bruce registers amazement at this. 
CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER 
The messenger is more amazed than Bruce as Burns keeps pumping his hand vigorously. 
MESSENGER There must be some mistake. I'm already married. 
BURNS (you never saw a more surprised man) Already married! (turning to Hildy o.s.) Hildy, why didn't you tell me? 
CLOSEUP HILDY 
She shakes her head at Burns' antics, but can't help smiling nevertheless. 
MEDIUM SHOT BURNS AND MESSENGER 
BURNS (again seizing messenger's hand) Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin! 
MESSENGER But my name -- 
BRUCE (as he enters scene) Mr. Burns! 
Burns turns slightly but doesn't release messenger's hand. 
BURNS Yeah? You'll have to excuse me -- I'm busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin here. Just leave your card with the boy. 
CLOSE SHOT BRUCE AND BURNS 
Bruce takes hold of Burns' coat and shakes it to get his attention. Burns turns on him: 
BURNS I'm very sorry, but I'm busy! Look -- (he points o.s.) -- there's the boy. Take your card and leave it with him. 
He turns away again. Bruce, determinedly, takes hold of his sleeve and pulls at it. 
BRUCE Mr. Burns -- 
BURNS (wheeling around) I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin! 
BRUCE I'm Bruce Baldwin! 
MEDIUM SHOT 
Burns, still pumping the dazed messenger's hand, stops at this, drops hand, and turns to Bruce: 
BURNS You're Bruce Baldwin? 
BRUCE Yes! 
BURNS (accusing to messenger) Then who are you? 
MESSENGER (falteringly) My name's Pete Davis. 
BURNS Pete Davis! Well, Mr. Davis, this is no concern of yours and after this I'll thank you to keep out of my affairs! 
The messenger isn't quite sure what he's done but he slinks back to his seat as Burns turns to Bruce. 
CLOSEUP HILDY 
She is beginning to get sore, but reluctantly again she is compelled to smile at Walter's behavior. 
CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND BRUCE 
BURNS (reaches for Bruce's hand but grabs the umbrella and begins shaking the handle up and down) This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake. 
BRUCE (he tries to shift the umbrella, calling Burns' attention to it, and offers his hand instead) 
BURNS Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related -- 
BRUCE (completely unnerved by this time, and you can't quite blame him) Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all. 
BURNS You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man. 
BRUCE (this is the final crusher) Oh. 
She kisses him, kisses her hand and pats it to Burns' cheek. 
HILDY So long, husbands. 
She goes. 
TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY 
leaving. She weaves just a bit. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO MEN 
They look after her. 
BRUCE (smiling a little) I never knew Hildy to be so determined before. 
BURNS You haven't seen anything yet. 
Bruce turns to look at Burns -- they look at each other. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG - DAY CLOSE SHOT AT TELEPHONE 
It is ringing. A hand comes in to take the phone. CAMERA DRAWS BACK A LITTLE to show Endicott taking the phone. He has an eye shade over his eyes and five cards in his other hand. 
ENDICOTT (into phone) Criminal Courts Press Room... This is Endicott... No, nothing new on the Williams case yet boss. Well, you bet I'm here plugging away every minute. (hangs up and studies his cards) Up a dime. 
CAMERA PANS SLOWLY to reveal the other players as they speak. Playing are reporters Murphy, Endicott, Wilson, Schwartz and McCue. 
MURPHY (dropping his cards) By me. 
WILSON (also dropping) Droparoo. 
Schwartz knocks on table and drops cards. 
MCCUE (reluctantly) I'll call. 
ENDICOTT Three sixes. Is that any good? 
HILDY'S VOICE It sure looks good from here. 
The boys all look up toward sound of Hildy's voice. 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY JOHNSON 
framed in the doorway. She is carrying a bag and has changed her costume to a tailored travelling suit. She grins and comes into the room. 
MED. SHOT REPORTERS 
They are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene. There are ad libs of "Hildy!" "Where'd you come from?" "Holy Mackeral, Hildy Johnson!", etc. Hildy raises her hand for silence. 
HILDY One at a time, boys. 
She enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk, takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the corner, comes back to desk and opens the travelling bag. All through the above action she is talking rapidly. 
HILDY No, I'm not back for good. I'm just covering the Earl Williams story for Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack of something but will be all right by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up with Walter Burns -- far from it! As a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight for Albany and I'll be married tomorrow morning. The lucky man is Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in the insurance business -- and when I say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are there any other questions? 
Hildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag, looks at the stockings she is wearing, sees she has a run and takes a fresh pair out of the bag. She sits down and begins to put on the new stockings. 
ENDICOTT (grinning) Well, that about covers everything. 
HILDY Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun? 
MURPHY If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes. 
MCCUE It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job. (waving his hand toward Wilson) Take it away, Fred Wilson! 
WILSON Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding. (gesturing toward Schwartz) Come in, Dave Schwartz. 
SCHWARTZ His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all. 
HILDY Thanks, boys. That's all I want to know. 
Hildy gets up, rolls the pair of stockings she has just discarded into a ball, crosses to Bensinger's desk and puts the stockings in a drawer. 
ENDICOTT Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk. 
HILDY I know, I just want to give him a thrill. 
Hildy crosses back to desk and sits down. 
HILDY All right, boys, now that everything is settled, deal me in. 
Hildy glances toward clock on wall. The hands show 2:45 PM. 
INSERT: CLOCK - Hands pointing to 2:45 PM. 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY 
She picks up phone nearest her on desk and starts to dial, picking up cards dealt her with one hand. 
HILDY (into phone) Hello, this is Hildy Johnson. Get me Walter Burns. (she studies her cards -- then, into phone) Hello, Walter. How's the old double- crosser? 
CLOSE SHOT WALTER BURNS 
Telephone at his ear. 
BURNS Hello, my fine-feathered friend. Thought I might be hearing from you. What have you got to report? 
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT and we see that Burns is stripped to the waist. A doctor is applying a stethoscope to his chest. We HOLD the picture a second: Burns listening intently on the phone and the doctor listening intently to his chest. 
BURNS (into phone) Going all right, eh? 
DOCTOR (nodding) Fine. 
Doctor suddenly realizes what he's said and looks up. 
BURNS (putting hand over mouthpiece of phone) Doctor, will you please keep quiet a minute? How do you expect me to get any work done? 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bruce, who has some papers in front of him at the desk. Bruce grins. 
DOCTOR How do you expect me to get anywhere if you're going to keep on that phone? If you'll just give me two minutes more -- 
BURNS (into phone) Well, they haven't finished with me yet but I'm hoping to get my shirt back. Oh, no. I'm in the pink of condition. They found two new dimples. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRESS ROOM - CRIMINAL COURTS BLDG. CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT TELEPHONE 
cards in her other hand. 
HILDY How about that check? All right, Mr. Burns, but remember, no checkee -- no story. Well, as soon as they decide whether you live or not will you have that new man of mine call me up? Yes, sir. (she hangs up) All right, boys. Up a dime. 
ENDICOTT'S VOICE Right back at you. 
MED. SHOT 
INT. WALTER BURNS' OFFICE MED. SHOT 
The doctor has gone. Burns is adjusting his shirt. Bruce is sitting at the desk. 
BRUCE I don't know. This makes me feel funny. 
TWO SHOT 
BURNS Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to. 
BRUCE I feel I ought to take care of her. 
BURNS Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent. 
BRUCE Well, I'm independent, too. 
BURNS Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries? 
BRUCE Well, of course, if you put it that way. 
BURNS (everything he has on the ball) And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too. 
BRUCE I'm beginning to realize that. 
BURNS And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone. 
BRUCE (a lump in his throat) Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you. 
BURNS No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over. 
He turns away, wipes his eyes, and sneaks a glance to see how that goes over. It goes over big -- Bruce hurriedly wipes a tear away. 
MED. SHOT 
as Duffy comes into the room. He advances toward the desk. 
DUFFY (placing check on desk) Here's that certified check, Walter. (sotto voce) I drew out my wife's savings, and if this isn't back by 5:30 I'm a ruined man! 
BURNS (also sotto voce) Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five. (louder) Thanks, Duffy. Stick around. (picking up check he rises) 
He walks over to Bruce. 
BURNS Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything. 
BRUCE (also rising) Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you. 
CLOSEUP DUFFY 
He reacts to this sweetly solemn thought. 
BURNS AND BRUCE 
CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM as Burns walks Bruce toward door, his arm around him. 
BRUCE Well, she'll know some day. 
BURNS That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute. 
He releases Bruce, runs back and gets umbrella and brings it to him. 
BURNS Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again. 
BRUCE Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story. 
They are at the door. Burns opens the door for Bruce. 
SHOT FEATURING LOUIS 
Louis is sitting at a desk, apparently engrossed in a newspaper. He is all alert, however. Bruce and Burns come into the scene talking. 
BURNS Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man. 
BRUCE (embarrassed) Thanks a lot. 
They pass Louis. He looks up. 
BRUCE AND BURNS 
Bruce, still embarrassed, looks down. Burns turns and signals to Louis. 
CLOSE SHOT LOUIS 
watching. 
CLOSE SHOT BURNS 
Burns points to Bruce's back. 
CLOSE SHOT LOUIS 
Louis nods. 
BRUCE AND BURNS 
BURNS Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you? 
BRUCE Oh, sure. (he extends his hand) Well, thanks for everything. 
BURNS Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long. 
BRUCE So long. 
He turns and goes. Burns watches him. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Bruce is going out, his back toward Camera. Burns watches. Louis comes between Burns and Bruce and follows Bruce out as we see Bruce going toward outer door. 
CLOSEUP BURNS 
He rubs his hands in glee as he starts back for his office. 
INT. PRESS ROOM SHOT FEATURING HILDY 
She is raking in a pot. 
HILDY I don't know why you boys are so good to me. 
MCCUE (throwing cards down) Your poker's improved a lot, Hildy. Lend me two bucks, will you? 
HILDY Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps. 
There is a whirr and crash from the gallows. They start. 
BENSINGER AT WINDOW 
BENSINGER I wish they'd stop that practicing. 
COP Come on! 
He whistles. 
COP (to mob) Beat it! 
CLOSE SHOT THREE 
as they go through crowd. The look on poor Bruce's face, muddy anyhow, is something. Suddenly, Bruce cries: 
BRUCE My hat! 
COP Get his hat, somebody. 
CLOSEUP BRUCE'S HAT 
lying top up, in a puddle. Hand reaches in and picks it up. 
CLOSE SHOT THREE 
as hat is passed to cop, who jams it down on Bruce's head. Another takem from Bruce. 
INT. COUNTY JAIL MED. CLOSE SHOT 
at the door of Earl Williams' cell. Hildy sits on a stool at the door, pencil and copy paper in hand. Earl Williams sits at the edge of his cot, facing Hildy. There is a bouquet of roses in a water pitcher by the cot. Our first impression of Williams is that he's a rational, well-poised citizen. It is only under Hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals himself. 
WILLIAMS I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else. 
HILDY (puzzled and worried) You didn't mean to kill that policeman? 
WILLIAMS Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs. 
HILDY What are your beliefs, Earl? 
WILLIAMS They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things. 
HILDY How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl? 
WILLIAMS I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense. 
HILDY (writing) "Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer. 
WILLIAMS It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense? 
CLOSEUP HILDY 
HILDY (thoughtfully) Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl. 
WILLIAM'S VOICE Just use things for what they were meant, that's all. 
HILDY Sure. (she studies him a moment) What's the purpose of a gun, Earl? 
CLOSEUP WILLIAMS 
WILLIAMS A gun? (he thinks -- then a revealing smile breaks out) Why -- to shoot, of course. 
MED. CLOSE TWO SHOT 
HILDY Is that how you came to shoot the policeman? 
WILLIAMS Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it? 
HILDY (writing) Very simple, Earl. 
WILLIAMS There's nothing crazy about that, is there? 
HILDY No, Earl, not at all. (she indicates the flowers) Who sent you the flowers, Earl? 
WILLIAMS (reverently) Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person. 
HILDY (pointing to picture pinned on wall) Isn't that her picture? 
WILLIAMS (turning toward it) Yes. Isn't she beautiful? 
INSERT: PICTURE OF MOLLIE 
HILDY'S VOICE If you should be pardoned, are you figuring on marrying Mollie? 
EARL'S VOICE Oh, no, she's much too good for me. 
HARTMAN'S VOICE How'd you get in here? 
MEDIUM SHOT 
Sheriff Hartman has come into the scene. Hildy turns toward him. 
HILDY Same way you did. (pointing) Through that gate. 
HARTMAN I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission. 
HILDY All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say. 
HARTMAN Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams? 
HILDY Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it -- 
HARTMAN (beaming) Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too. (turning toward Williams) 'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling? 
WILLIAMS Fine, thanks, Sheriff. 
HARTMAN That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you? 
WILLIAMS I won't. 
HARTMAN (to Hildy) Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging? 
HILDY (in a low voice so Williams won't overhear) No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight. 
HARTMAN (just as loud as ever) You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy. 
HILDY That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later. 
WILLIAMS Don't forget about production for use. 
HILDY I won't, Earl. (she goes) 
INT. PRESS ROOM GROUP SHOT POKER GAME - NIGHT 
The game is on. Bensinger, at his desk, is reading a book. The electric lights have been switched on. 
MURPHY (raking in a pot) Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around. 
ENDICOTT Who's this guy she's gonna marry? 
WILSON Baldwin -- his name is. 
SCHWARTZ I give that marriage six months. 
ENDICOTT What's the use? I can't win a pot. 
CLOSE SHOT WILSON AT PHONE 
WILSON (into phone) Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right. (he covers transmitter) 
MED. SHOT TAKING DOOR 
WILSON (to others) Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself. 
SCHWARTZ What's he want? 
WILSON Wants Hildy -- and sounds very excited. 
Hildy comes back. Looks at them and stares contemptuously. 
HILDY Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better. 
WILSON Phone for you, Hildy. 
HILDY (going toward it) Who is it? 
WILSON Oh, some insurance man. Are you in? 
HILDY (grabbing phone) Give me that! 
CLOSEUP HILDY 
HILDY (into phone) Hello! Hello! Bruce?... what?... Where are you?... You're where?... How did that happen?... (she listens unbelievingly a second) I'll be right over! 
MED. SHOT 
as Hildy hangs up and darts out of room. The others watch in amazement. 
MURPHY Boy, did you see her go? 
ENDICOTT Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub. 
WILSON I told you Baldwin was in trouble. 
MCCUE Probably went out without his hankie and wants Mamma to wipe his nose. 
SCHWARTZ I still give that marriage six months. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER 
at phone. 
BENSINGER Hello, baby, get me the Sheriff's offico, will you... Hello, Sheriff Hartman?... This is Bensinger. How about that favor? You know what: once and for all, will you hang this guy at five A.M. instead of seven? It won't hurt you and we can make the City Edition. 
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE CLOSE SHOT SHERIFF HARTMAN 
at phone. 
HARTMAN (indignantly) Once and for all, I'm not going to hang anybody except at the legal hour... What? Don't threaten me, Bensinger! I'm not afraid of any newspapers. Yeah?... Oh, shut up! (he hangs up; an afterthought -- he calls up operator) And, operator, I told you not to disturb me! I don't care who calls -- I don't want to be disturbed again till I tell you! (he hangs up -- turns to somebody o.s. and speaks) How do you like that, Dr. Egelhoffer? Want me to hang williams at their convenience! 
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A MED. GROUP SHOT, showing Williams, Sheriff Hartman and Dr. Egelhoffer. They are the only occupants of room. Williams is seated facing a large standing searchlight. 
EGELHOFFER The newspapers! Sheriff, they're the scum of modern civilization. 
HARTMAN You said it! 
EGELHOFFER They're always after me for interviews. 
HARTMAN Me, too. 
EGELHOFFER (fencing) Of course, I sort of promised them I would give out a statement when I got through here. You don't mind? 
HARTMAN (not liking it) Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me. 
EGELHOFFER (he'll bargain) We'll have to satisfy them. What would you say to giving them a joint interview? I could give them some of the psychological aspects of the case and you could give them the legal aspects. 
HARTMAN (he buys) A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor. 
EGELHOFFER Yes, shaking hands. I don't take a very good picture, though. 
HARTMAN It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing. 
EGELHOFFER Yes, I suppose so. It all helps. 
WILLIAMS (just a spectator up to now) Are you gentlemen all through with me? 
EGELHOFFER Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you were here. No, Mr. Williams, we still have some questions for you. Sheriff, will you kindly extinguish the lights? 
The Sheriff puts out the lights and the Doctor switches on the searchlight, which shines in Williams' face. 
EGELHOFFER You know you are to be executed, Mr. Williams. Who do you feel is responsible for that? 
WILLIAMS The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe. 
EGELHOFFER I see. You realize, however, that you committed a crime? 
CLOSEUP WILLIAMS 
WILLIAMS In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. POLICE CELL CLOSEUP BRUCE 
BRUCE I'm innocent. I didn't do anything. I never stole a watch in my life. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to show us Bruce in police cell. Hildy outside. A police lieutenant with her in b.g. 
HILDY I know you didn't, Bruce. 
She whirls on lieutenant. 
HILDY (to lieutenant) Let him out of here, Lieutenant. 
LIEUTENANT (conciliatingly) But, Hildy, I can't. He's accused of stealing a watch. And they found the watch on him. 
HILDY And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames? 
LIEUTENANT Now, Hildy -- 
HILDY Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out? 
LIEUTENANT I can't. 
HILDY All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it! 
LIEUTENANT Now, Hildy, don't be hasty! I can't let him out. 
HILDY You can let him out on bail, can't you? 
INT. SHERIFF HARTMAN'S OFFICE MED. SHOT 
WILLIAMS I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued. 
HARTMAN Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor. 
EGELHOFFER Just one thing more. I'd like to reenact the crime, Mr. Williams. May I have your gun, please, Sheriff? 
Hartman starts to take gun out, hesitates. 
HARTMAN I don't know -- 
EGELHOFFER (insistently) Come, come, Sheriff, lightning doesn't strike in the same place twice. Nothing's going to happen. 
Hartman hands him the gun. 
EGELHOFFER Now, the Sheriff will be Mollie Malloy, in whose room you were. You will be Earl Williams. And I will be the policeman. Follow me, Mr. Williams? 
WILLIAMS Yes, sir. 
Egelhoffer hands the gun to Williams and then backs up a few paces. 
EGELHOFFER So -- now I say to you: 'Earl Williams, you are under arrest!' and you point your gun at me. 
WILLIAMS (hesitantly) Well, it wasn't exactly that way -- 
EGELHOFFER (insistently) Point the gun at me! 
Williams does so. 
EGELHOFFER Then what did you do? 
Williams hesitates for a moment and then pulls the trigger. Hartman promptly dives under the desk as Egelhoffer topples over. 
WILLIAMS (pathetically) Now can I go, please? 
There is a loud banging on the door and a voice calling: 
VOICE Hey, Sheriff! Open up! What happened? 
Williams, alarmed by voice, turns and starts toward window. 
INT. PRESS ROOM MED. GROUP SHOT 
Hildy is now wearing her hat and gloves. She picks up her bag and starts for the door. 
ENDICOTT Goodbye, Yonson. 
MCCUE So long, Hildy. 
MURPHY Send us a postcard, kid. 
SCHWARTZ Who'll keep the lamp in the window for you. 
BENSINGER Goodbye, Hildy. 
Hildy has crossed to doorway, the CAMERA TRUCKING WITH HER. She turns and faces the room to make a last bravura speech. 
HILDY Well, goodbye, you wage-slaves. When you're crawling up fire escapes, getting kicked out of front doors, and eating Christmas dinners in one- armed joints, don't forget your pal, Hildy Johnson! And, remember, my husband sells insurance! 
She turns and starts on a bit of verse: 
HILDY "It takes a heap o' livin' to make a house a home." 
She is interrupted by a terrific fusillade of shots in the courtyard. A roar of excited voices comes up. For a tense second, everyone is motionless. There is another volley of shots. Wilson, Endicott and Murphy jump for the window. 
CLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW 
VOICES FROM COURTYARD Get the riot guns! Spread out, you fellows! Etc. 
WILSON There's a jail-break! 
MURPHY (at window, simultaneously) Cooley! What's the matter What's happened? 
VOICES FROM YARD Watch the gate! He's probably trying the gate! 
Outside, a siren begins to wail. 
ENDICOTT (out the window) Who got away? Who was it? 
VOICE OUTSIDE Earl... Williams!!! 
THE REPORTERS Who? Who'd he say? Earl Williams! It was Earl Williams! He got away! Etc. 
SHOT AT DESK 
MCCUE Holy ---! Gimme that telephone! (works hook frantically) Hurry! Hurry up! This is important! 
MED. SHOT TAKING IN DOOR 
Searchlights hit the windows, sweeping from direction of the jail. Hildy stands paralyzed, her bundle in her hand. There is another rifle volley. Two windowpanes crash into the room. Some plaster falls. Gongs sound above the siren. The boys are jumping for their telephones. Another windowpane goes. 
MCCUE (screaming) Look out! 
CLOSE SHOT AT WINDOW 
MURPHY (out the window) Look out where you're aiming, will you? 
A QUICK MONTAGE 
of reporters at their various phones follows: "Gimme the desk!" "Flash!" "Earl Williams just escaped!" "Don't know yet -- call you back.", etc., are shouted into the phones by Schwartz, Wilson, McCue, Endicott, Bensinger and Murphy. After each man communicates with his paper, he dashes for the door. 
MEDIUM SHOT 
The last of the reporters is gone. 
CLOSE SHOT - HILDY 
Her bag, almost unnoticed, falls to the floor. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER as she moves back into the room, absently grabbing and trailing a chair. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
HILDY Ahhh -- 
She lets go of the chair and takes one of the telephones. 
HILDY Morning Post?... Get me Walter Burns -- quick! Hildy Johnson calling. 
Very calmly she sits on the long table, her back against the wall and waits. 
CLOSEUP - HILDY 
HILDY Walter?... Hildy. Earl Williams just escaped from the County Jail. Yep... yep... yep... don't worry! I'm on the job! 
She hangs up. 
MEDIUM SHOT 
He hangs up and exits. 
MURPHY (to Hildy) Any dope yet on how he got out? 
HILDY From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him. 
HARTMAN I'm very disappointed in you, Hildy Johnson. 
He turns and exits. 
CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE NEAR HILDY'S PHONE 
taking in Hildy and Murphy. 
MURPHY How do you suppose Williams got that gun? 
As Hildy shrugs, there is another flurry of machine-gun fire. Murphy leaves precipitately. Hildy, alone at last, picks up the phone. 
HILDY (into phone) Give me Walter Burns -- quick -- 
She lays down the telephone receiver and crosses to the door which she closes, then returns to the phone. 
HILDY (picking up phone) Walter, listen. I've got the inside story on how Williams got the gun and escaped. 
INT. WALTER BURNS' OFFICE - DAY CLOSE SHOT - BURNS 
at his desk, telephone to his ear. 
BURNS Exclusive? That's great. 
INT. PRESS ROOM - DAY CLOSE SHOT - HILDY 
HILDY It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley. 
INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS 
BURNS Never mind that. What's the story? 
INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY 
HILDY Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money! 
INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS 
BURNS You'll get it. Now what's the story? (he raises his hand) I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave. 
INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY 
HILDY Wait a minute. Your mother's alive. 
INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS 
BURNS I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?! 
INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY 
HILDY Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime -- 
She starts to giggle at the thought. 
HILDY Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman! 
INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS 
BURNS (laughing) No kidding, Hildy. (suspiciously) Say, this isn't a rib? 
INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY 
HILDY No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover. 
INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT - BURNS 
BURNS That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes. 
INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT - HILDY 
HILDY It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band. 
INT. BURNS' OFFICE CLOSE SHOT BURNS 
BURNS Hold on a minute. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK disclosing Louis and a blonde sitting on a divan in Walter's office. Burns' beckons the blonde: 
BURNS (his hand carefully over receiver of phone) Come here. There's a guy waiting in a taxi in front of the Criminal Courts building. His name is Bruce Baldwin. Can you do your stuff? 
BLONDE I've never flopped on you, have I? 
BURNS Then scram! You've got about two minutes. 
She exits. 
BURNS (into phone) Sorry to keep you waiting. How much was it again? Four hundred and fifty dollars? Hang on a second. 
He puts his hand over the phone again and beckons to Louis. 
BURNS (to Louis) I need four hundred and fifty dollars in counterfeit money. You know where I can get it? 
LOUIS It's awful funny -- I happen to have some on me. 
BURNS (into phone) It's coming right over. I'm sending it over with Louis. Thanks for the story and good luck on your honeymoon. 
INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT HILDY AT TELEPHONE 
HILDY Keep the thanks, but just see that the money gets here! 
She hangs up. The door opens and McCue enters and crosses to his phone. 
MCCUE Hello, Hildy. I thought you were gone. 
HILDY I thought so, too. 
Hildy takes a look at the clock, rises and begins to pace up and down, pounding her hands together. 
CLOSE SHOT MCCUE AT PHONE 
MCCUE (into phone) McCue speaking. Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, eight-sixty-one and a half South State Street, colored, gave birth to a pickaninny in a patrol wagon with Sheriff Hartman's special Rifle Squad acting as nurses. Well -- Phoebe was walking along the street when all of a sudden she began -- that's right. So the police coaxed her into the patrol wagon and they started a race with the stork. When the pickaninny was born the Rifle Squad examined him carefully to see if it was Earl Williams who they knew was hiding somewhere. 
MED. SHOT 
Hildy is still pacing. McCue laughs at his own joke. 
MCCUE (to Hildy) Did you get that, Hildy? 
HILDY No -- what? 
Hildy's phone rings. She answers. 
HARTMAN (pleadingly) I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night. 
MAYOR Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours? (gesturing) Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it? 
HARTMAN (with dignity) If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years. 
They come to the door of the Sheriff's office. Hartman opens door and the Mayor enters, Hartman following. 
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Hartman closes door and turns to Mayor, who faces him portentously. 
MAYOR Pete, you're through! 
HARTMAN (stunned) What do you mean -- through? 
MAYOR I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make. 
HARTMAN (David to Jonathan) Fred! 
MAYOR Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side. 
HARTMAN Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature. 
MAYOR I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete. 
HARTMAN Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister. 
MAYOR (wavering and desperate) If there was any way out... 
As a phone rings: 
HARTMAN There is a way out. I've got Williams surrounded, haven't I? What more do you want? (into phone) Hello... Yes... Hello! (wildly) Four hundred suppers! Nothing doing! This is a man-hunt -- not a banquet!... The twelve dollars includes everything!! 
He hangs up. 
HARTMAN That gives you an idea of what I'm up against! 
MAYOR (hotly) We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'. 
Sheriff winces. 
MAYOR Williams ain't a Red, and you know it! 
HARTMAN Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around -- 
MAYOR I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em? 
HARTMAN But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away. 
A knock on the door. 
MAYOR What do you mean he can't get away?! He got away, didn't he? 
Knocking louder. 
MAYOR Who's out there? 
VOICE OUTSIDE (PINKUS) Is Sheriff Hartman in there? 
Sheriff starts for door. 
HARTMAN (relieved) Ah! For me! 
MED. SHOT TAKING IN DOOR 
Sheriff opens the door. A small, very colorless and ineffectual man named Pinkus is there. 
HARTMAN (as he opens door, disclosing Pinkus) I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me? 
PINKUS (coming in) You're certainly a hard fellow to find, Sheriff. 
MAYOR (annoyed) What do you want? 
PINKUS (taking a document from his pocket and proffering it to Sheriff) I'm a messenger at the State House. This is from the Governor. 
MAYOR What's from the Governor? 
PINKUS The reprieve for Earl Williams. 
HARTMAN (stunned) For who? 
PINKUS (amiably) Earl Williams. The reprieve. 
MAYOR W-wait a minute. 
Getting his bearings. 
HARTMAN (bursting forth) The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago! 
MAYOR And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you. (to Pinkus) Who else knows about this? 
The Sheriff, with shaking hands, opens and begins to read the thing. 
PINKUS They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing. 
MAYOR (to Sheriff) Get the Governor on the phone! 
PINKUS (helpfully) You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now. 
MAYOR Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan! 
HARTMAN (thrusting the document at the Mayor) Read it! Insane, he says. (shaking a finger in Pinkus' face) He knows very well that Williams ain't insane! 
PINKUS Yeah. But I -- 
MAYOR (interrupting) Pure politics! 
HARTMAN An attempt to ruin us! 
The phone rings. Hartman starts for it. 
MAYOR (reading) Dementia praecox Oh-h-h! 
HARTMAN We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em? 
MAYOR Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you. 
HARTMAN Ah, Fred -- (into phone) Hello... this is Hartman -- 
MAYOR (apoplectic) And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now! 
HARTMAN (from the phone) Sssh. Wait, Fred. (excitedly, into phone) What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses! 
MAYOR What is it? 
HARTMAN They got him! (back to phone) Wait a minute -- hold the wire. (to the Mayor) They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house. 
HILDY (wheeling towards door) Louie! 
She drops the phone and hurries towards him. 
HILDY Have you got my dough? 
LOUIS Oh, sure. The boss sent me over with it. Four hundred dollars, wasn't it? 
HILDY Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks! 
LOUIS All right, all right. You can't blame a guy for tryin', can you? 
HILDY Come on with that money! 
LOUIS First you got to sign a receipt. (he pulls out a receipt) 
HILDY Where's the money? 
LOUIS Keep your shirt on. I got it -- right here. (he picks out money and counts) One hundred -- two hundred -- three hundred -- four hundred -- and fifty. Now sign. 
HILDY (grabs money and signs) Here! 
LOUIS Thanks. So long, Hildy! 
HILDY (grabbing him) So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet? 
LOUIS Huh? 
HILDY None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life! 
LOUIS Now don't get excited, Hildy! I don't know what you're talking about -- but is this Mr. Baldwin's wallet? 
He takes Bruce's wallet out. 
HILDY (grabbing it) You know it is! 
LOUIS I didn't frisk him. He must have dropped it in Burns' office. I didn't know whose it was. 
HILDY No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you? 
LOUIS (surprised) What -- already? Why, the dame left only a minute before I did! 
He suddenly realizes what he's said and sprints for the door. Hildy chucks something at him. It just misses as he ducks out of the door. 
MED. SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE 
Hildy casts a savage look after the departed Louie, takes another look at the clock and grabs a phone and starts to dial. 
HILDY (into phone) 27th Precinct Station House? 
Hildy stops short, arrested by a sound from the open window. She turns and sees Earl Williams, looking more inoffensive and exhausted than ever, indeed on the verge of collapse. He carries a large revolver. The search-lights that have been playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again. 
WILLIAMS (pointing gun at her) Drop that phone -- 
Hildy drops the phone back on the hook. 
WILLIAMS (supporting himself by holding on to edge of desk) You're not going to phone anybody where I am. 
HILDY (bracing herself) Put down that gun, Earl. 
He advances steadily toward Hildy, the gun aimed at her. 
HILDY You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use". 
WILLIAMS Yes -- that's right. Production for use. 
Hildy starts walking toward him, slowly. 
HILDY Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you? 
WILLIAMS Don't move! 
Hildy stops. 
WILLIAMS Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here. 
HILDY Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody. 
WILLIAMS No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone. 
Hildy sneaks another step forward. 
HILDY Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview. 
WILLIAMS What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody. 
HILDY I don't blame you, Earl. (another step forward) If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either. 
WILLIAMS (suddenly) Keep away! 
He points the gun at Hildy, pulls the trigger and we hear a faint "click!" 
WILLIAMS (weakly) I guess I used all the shells. 
CLOSE TWO SHOT 
He drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for support. Hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side of the desk for support. And at this moment she looks more tired than he does. She looks at Earl and breathes heavily. 
HILDY Earl, you must never do that again. 
WILLIAMS Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this. 
HILDY (more her old self now) Well, maybe you think I could! 
CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she retrieves the gun and jams it in her purse, jumps to the windows, pulls down the shades. 
EARL'S VOICE I'm not afraid to die. I was tellin' the fella that when he handed me the gun. 
Hildy crosses swiftly to the door, locks it and puts out the lights, so that they are visible only faintly in the light from the areaway. 
HILDY Don't talk too loud. 
WILLIAMS (babbling on as she moves about) Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you? 
HILDY Sure I do, Earl. 
Hildy is looking around for a hiding place for him. 
WILLIAMS I wish they'd take me back and hang me. I done my best. 
He abruptly crumples and falls to the floor. Hildy stands for a second, desperate. Then she picks him up and half carries, half drags him over toward a chair and places him in it. Then she makes a quick dash for her phone. 
HILDY (into phone) Hello... Gimme Walter Burns -- quick! 
Another phone there rings. Hildy answers it, propping the receiver of her own phone between ear and shoulder. 
CLOSEUP HILDY AT PHONE 
There is further and louder pounding on the door. Earl gets in the desk. Hildy and Mollie pull the roll-top down over him. 
HILDY (calling) I'm coming! (to Earl) Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe. 
MOLLIE (to Earl) I'll be right here. I won't leave you. 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR 
ENDICOTT (giving door a terrific kick) Hey! 
INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MOLLIE 
HILDY (to Mollie) Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted! 
MOLLIE What's the idea? 
HILDY Never mind! Just play dead. 
Hildy rapidly unbuttons Mollie's waist and throws it back. The kicking at the door continues. 
MED. SHOT 
Hildy rushes over to windows and pulls up the shades. Mollie is lying quietly on the floor with her eyes closed. Hildy rushes over to water cooler and gets a paper cup full of water. She throws the water in Mollie's face. 
MOLLIE (spluttering) Hey -- 
HILDY (fiercely) Shut up, you! 
Hildy crosses swiftly to the door. 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR 
The door opens in Endicott's face and there is Miss Johnson, quite cool. 
ENDICOTT Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know. 
HILDY Run down and get some smelling salts, will you? 
WILSON Smelling salts! What's going on here? 
They catch sight of Mollie, stretched out on the floor. 
ENDICOTT Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her? 
HILDY (as Endicott and Wilson enter room) Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to. 
INT. PRESS ROOM MED. SHOT 
Mollie is shaking her head. 
ENDICOTT She looks as though she's going to come to. 
HILDY Give me a hand with her, will you? 
ENDICOTT Okay. (lifting Mollie) Up you go, Mollie. 
Hildy and Endicott lift Mollie and seat her in a chair. Wilson crosses to his phone. 
CLOSE SHOT WILSON AT PHONE 
WILSON (into Phone) City Desk. 
MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Taking in Hildy, Wilson and Mollie and Endicott. 
ENDICOTT She'll be all right. (crosses to his phone) The Desk. 
WILSON (into phone) Well, they surrounded the house, all right, only they forgot to tell Williams, and he wasn't there. 
MED. LONG SHOT TAKING IN DOOR 
Murphy comes in. 
MURPHY (seeing Hildy, who has been fastening Mollie's blouse) Hildy, I thought you were gone -- 
HILDY Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could. 
MURPHY Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear. 
Murphy crosses to his phone. McCue comes in. 
MCCUE (panting) What a chase! 
ENDICOTT (into phone) No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back. 
He hangs up. 
WILSON (into phone) Okay, later. 
He hangs up. 
MURPHY (into phone) Murphy talking. 
Schwartz comes in. 
HILDY Any news? 
SCHWARTZ Yeah. I was never so tired in my life. 
He picks up his phone. 
MCCUE (into phone) Where? Harrison Street Station? All right, connect me. 
SCHWARTZ (into phone) Schwartz calling... Out with Hartman's deputies. I'm in a drugstore. You can't call me back because I'm going right on with them. 
He hangs up -- puts his feet on the desk. 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND MOLLIE 
HILDY Are you all right, now? 
MOLLIE Yeah, I'm feelin' fine. 
MED. SHOT GROUP 
MURPHY Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life. 
MCCUE (turning from phone) Yeah, hold the line. Hey, this looks good. An old lady just called the detective bureau and claims Williams is hiding in her cellar. Well - we've looked every other place. Want to go out on it? 
ENDICOTT Aw, nuts with chasing around any more. I spent a dollar-forty on taxis already. 
SCHWARTZ I say we don't go out any more. Let Earl Williams come to us. 
CLOSEUP HILDY 
HILDY A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT HILDY 
at typewriter, smoke rising from her cigarette. As the CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS we see a fairly disheveled Hildy typing away furiously. 
BURNS' VOICE (Into phone) "The Blackest cesspool in American city life!" Hold on Duffy, I'll see if she's got any more. 
Burns comes into the scene, tears a page out of Hildy's typewriter. She inserts another one without noticing. 
MED. SHOT 
Burns goes back to the phone as Hildy continues to type furiously. 
BURNS (into phone) Duffy -- Duffy! (clicking the phone furiously) Operator! Operator! Get me Duffy back. Somebody cut us off! 
ANOTHER ANGLE FAVORING DOOR 
as Bruce Baldwin enters. 
BRUCE Hildy! 
BURNS What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy! (suddenly, into phone) Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that? 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY 
typing away madly. Bruce comes into the scene. 
BRUCE Hildy! 
HILDY (looking up, very casually) Hello, Bruce... 
She resumes her typing, then suddenly realizes the situation and jumps up. 
HILDY BRUCE!! How'd you get out? 
BRUCE (the hands-off attitude) Not through any help of yours, Hildy. 
HILDY Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam -- 
BURNS' VOICE Hildy! 
MED. SHOT 
As Hildy turns toward his voice, Burns, still with the phone in his hand, keeps talking to her. 
BURNS For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story! 
HILDY (resignedly) Okay, Walter. (sits down at her typewriter again) 
CLOSE TWO SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY 
Hildy begins typing again. 
BRUCE I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail... (desperately) I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station! 
HILDY (she barely stops typing) We'll explain the whole thing to them. (resumes typing) 
BRUCE I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours. 
HILDY Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that. (calling o.s. to Walter) Walter! 
CLOSE SHOT BURNS 
BURNS (into phone) Take the President's speech and run it on the funny page... (turns to Hildy, o.s.) What is it, Hildy? 
HILDY'S VOICE What was the name of the Mayor's first wife? 
BURNS You mean the one who drank so much? Tillie! 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY AND BRUCE 
HILDY Thanks. (she types furiously) 
CLOSE SHOT THE DESK 
Its top opens slowly and Williams' head sticks out. 
CLOSEUP BURNS INCLUDING DESK IN B.G 
BURNS (screaming) Get back in there, you mock turtle! 
The desk-top falls, the fugitive disappearing within. 
CLOSEUP BRUCE 
turning around toward Burns. 
BRUCE Did you say anything, Mister Burns? 
CLOSEUP BURNS 
covering up, fast. 
BURNS No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office. (indicating phone in his hand) 
MED. CLOSE SHOT BRUCE AND HILDY 
BRUCE (to Burns) Oh. (turns to Hildy) I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you. 
HILDY Oh, she was here. 
BRUCE Where'd she go? 
HILDY Out some place. 
She types away. Bruce grabs her and stops her. 
BRUCE Hildy! Where's mother? 
HILDY Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went. 
BRUCE Did you give her the money? 
HILDY No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly. 
BRUCE Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars. 
HILDY Oh, yes. Here it is. 
She gets the wallet. Burns comes into the scene and pulls another page out of her machine. 
HILDY Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars. 
BRUCE (drily) Thank you. 
CLOSEUP BURNS 
HILDY (looking up suddenly) Where's Bruce? 
BURNS Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets. 
HILDY What tickets? 
BURNS Railroad tickets. 
HILDY Is he coming back here? 
BURNS Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you? 
MED. SHOT 
as Burns leaves Hildy and goes over to desk and picks up his phone again. 
BURNS (into phone) Duffy! 
EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER 
Finding the door locked, he knocks. 
INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT MED. CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY 
as another knock comes, they take it big. 
HILDY (calling) Who is it? 
EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER 
BENSINGER What's the idea of locking this? 
INT. PRESS ROOM - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY 
HILDY That's Bensinger. That's his desk. 
BURNS (whispering) What's his name? 
The door knob is rattled violently. 
HILDY Bensinger -- of the Tribune. 
EXT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOOR - NIGHT CLOSE SHOT BENSINGER 
BENSINGER Open this door! 
INT. PRESS ROOM CLOSE SHOT BURNS 
He starts for the door. 
BURNS I'll handle him. 
CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HIM to the door. 
BURNS The Tribune, eh? Watch me! 
He opens the door. 
AT DOOR 
BENSINGER (as he comes in) Ain't you got any more sense than to -- (sees Burns and is overcome) Oh, h-hello, Mr. Burns. Why, quite an honor having you come over here. 
BURNS (casually) Hello, Bensinger. 
BENSINGER Excuse me, I just want to -- 
He starts for the desk. Hildy's typing goes on, coming in over the scene. 
BURNS (starting for the desk, suddenly blocking his path) Quite a coincidence, my running into you tonight. Isn't it, Hildy? 
HILDY'S VOICE Yeh. 
BENSINGER How do you mean? 
CLOSEUP BURNS AND BENSINGER 
BURNS I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy. 
BENSINGER (essaying a pleasantry) Nothing -- ah -- detrimental, I hope. 
BURNS I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning. 
BENSINGER (deeply moved) Oh, did you -- care for the poem, Mr. Burns? 
BURNS (startled) The poem?... The poem was great! 
BENSINGER (blinking at these words) Remember the ending? (and he recites) " -- and all is well, outside his cell, But in his heart he hears the hangman Calling and the gallows falling And his white-haired mother's tears..." 
BURNS (overcome) Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me? 
BENSINGER What? 
MEDIUM SHOT 
taking in table, Hildy typing there. 
BURNS (to Bensinger) We need somebody like you. All we've got now are a lot of low-brows. Like Johnson here. 
He starts shoving Bensinger away from the desk, toward the table. 
BENSINGER Seriously, Mr. Burns? 
Clinging to him, Burns takes him to the phone. 
BURNS (into phone) Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you. (looking up at Bensinger) Mervyn, isn't it? 
BENSINGER No. Roy. Roy V. 
BURNS (with a little laugh at his own forgetfulness) Of course! (into phone) Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff. (to Bensinger) How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy? 
BENSINGER Seventy-five. 
BURNS I'll give you a hundred and a by- line. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
as Burns continues. 
BURNS (into phone) Let him have everything he wants. (puts down the receiver; turns to Bensinger) Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man. (acting it out) He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay! 
BENSINGER Sort of a Jack London style? 
TRUCKING SHOT 
BURNS Exactly! 
Leads him hurriedly to the door. 
LOUIE What do you mean, I handed her? The patrol wagon was on the wrong side of the street. 
BURNS Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station. 
CLOSEUP - LOUIE 
LOUIE I don't think she's talking much... You know what I mean? 
He winks reassuringly. 
BACK TO GROUP 
HILDY (paralyzed) Don't tell me -- was she killed? 
BURNS (hopefully) Was she? Did you notice? 
LOUIE Say, me with a gun on my hip and a kidnapped old lady on my hands, I should stick around asking questions from a lot of cops! You know what I mean? 
Hildy sinks into a chair. 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY IN THE CHAIR 
HILDY Dead... dead! That's the end! 
Burns comes into scene to her. 
BURNS It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be. 
HILDY (wildly) What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him? 
BURNS If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything. (whacking her on the shoulder) Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here? 
HILDY I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back! 
She buries her face in her hands. 
BURNS Look at me, Hildy -- 
HILDY (springing up) I'm looking at you -- you murderer! 
BURNS If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper! 
HILDY (calling off to Louie) Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out! 
MED. SHOT GROUP 
The Post phone rings. 
BURNS (grabbing Hildy) You stay here. I'll find out everything. 
LOUIE (to Hildy) Western an' Thirty-fourth. 
Hildy jumps for the outside phone on the desk. 
TWO SHOT INCLUDING BURNS AT PHONE AND HILDY AT PHONE 
BURNS (into phone) Hello -- hello... 
HILDY (into phone) Gimme Western four-five-five-seven. 
BURNS (guarded) Who? (wildly) Hello, Butch! Where are you? 
HILDY (into phone) Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room. 
BURNS (into phone) What are you doing there? Haven't you even started? 
HILDY (into phone) Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup? 
BURNS (into phone) Oh, for -- (yelling) H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen! 
HILDY (into phone) Nobody? (jiggles hook) Morningside three-one-two-four. 
BURNS (into phone) I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now! 
HILDY (into phone) Is this the Community Hospital? 
BURNS (howling into phone) I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through? 
HILDY (into phone) Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --? 
BURNS (into phone, drowning out Hildy) Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here! (indicates up to where) Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello? (turning, as he hangs up) I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em! (into Post phone) Duffy! (to the universe) Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation! (screaming into phone) Duffy!! 
HILDY Shut up, will you? (into phone) You sure? Nobody? 
BURNS (into phone) Duffy!!!! (listening) (into phone) Duffy!!!! (listening) Well, where is Duffy? (throwing receiver to desk) Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease. (turning) Louie. 
MED. SHOT GROUP 
BURNS (to Louie) It's up to you. 
LOUIE (loyally) Anything you want, Boss. 
BURNS Beat it out and get hold of some guys. 
LOUIE Who do you want? 
BURNS (starting for the door, followed by Louie) Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them. (confidentially) We've got to get this desk out of here. 
He unlocks the door. 
LOUIE You know me. The shirt off my back. 
BURNS You got plenty of money? 
LOUIE Sure, boss. 
BURNS I mean real money -- not counterfeit! 
LOUIE I always have both. 
He goes out. 
BURNS (calling after him) And don't bump into anything. 
He relocks the door. 
HILDY Lafayette two-one-hundred. 
BURNS (turning from door) That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it. (bitterly) Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this? 
CLOSE SHOT HILDY AT PHONE, TAKING IN DESK 
Burns steps into scene. 
BURNS (confidentially) If Louie doesn't come back in five minutes we'll get it out alone. There's millions of ways. We can start a fire and get the firemen to carry it out in the confusion. 
He crosses to the desk and inspects it. 
BURNS What is it? Here! 
She tosses the gun to Walter, but one of the deputies intercepts the throw. 
HARTMAN Gimme that. 
He takes the gun from the deputy. 
CLOSER SHOT 
The Sheriff stands frozen, staring at the gun. 
HARTMAN (to Hildy) Where'd you get this? 
HILDY I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to. 
HARTMAN Not this gun! 
Burns comes into scene. 
BURNS (easily) I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself. 
HARTMAN Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with! 
REPORTERS AD LIB What? What's that? Etc... 
BURNS (advancing on Sheriff) Are you trying to make me out a liar? 
MURPHY (bitterly at Hildy) It's the last time I ever trust a woman, Hildy. 
SCHWARTZ Maybe Williams was gonna be her best man. 
WILSON That's pretty rotten, Hildy. Crossing your own pals. 
HARTMAN (shoving up to Hildy; trembling) Where is Earl Williams? Where you got him? 
BURNS (sympathetically) You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman. 
HARTMAN I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is. 
HILDY He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer. 
HARTMAN (outraged) What? 
HILDY With a bag of marshmallows. 
The Sheriff stands silent -- then hastily turns. 
MED. SHOT GROUP AROUND HILDY 
REPORTERS AD LIB Come on, Hildy. Where is he?... This is a sweet trick, Hildy... I thought we were friends... Etc. (to Sheriff) Look here, Pete! What about Mister Burns?... Ask the Master Mind! What's he doing over here? 
HARTMAN (grabbing Burns' arm) Speak up! What do you know about this. 
BURNS (gently but firmly disengaging his hand) My dear Hartman! 
He moves casually to a post before the desk and maintains it. 
MURPHY Can that! Where is he? 
BURNS (to Sheriff) The Morning Post is not obstructing justice or hiding criminals. You ought to know that. 
HARTMAN No? Well -- (turning to Hildy) Johnson, you're under arrest. (turning to Burns) You, too, Burns. 
BURNS (calmly) Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing? 
HARTMAN I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this. 
BURNS You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff. 
HARTMAN We'll just start by impounding the Post property. (pointing to Bensinger's desk, addressing Hildy) Is that your desk? 
HILDY (jumping) No! 
BURNS (almost simultaneously) Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here. 
HARTMAN Oh, you do, eh? (to deputies) All right, boys. Confiscate that desk. 
Several of the deputies start toward the desk. 
BURNS (trying to intercept deputies) Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars. 
HARTMAN You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that. (to deputies) All right, boys. Take it. 
BURNS I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense. (to deputy nearest him) And you'll be an accessory! 
HARTMAN We'll take a chance on that, Burns. (to deputies) Go ahead, boys. (the deputies continue toward the desk) 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS ROOM - NIGHT MED. SHOT 
Flanked by two policemen, Mrs. Baldwin, dishevelled, with her hat over one ear, is marching toward the Press Room, bound for vengeance. Bruce, considerably upset, is with her. As they reach the door to the Press Room, Mrs. Baldwin stops. 
MRS. BALDWIN You wait outside, Bruce. 
BRUCE But, mother -- 
MRS. BALDWIN (firmly) No! You'll weaken when you see that little Jezebel! I'm going to tell her what I think of her! 
She plumps her hat down more firmly on her head and marches into the Press Room followed by the two policemen. Bruce remains outside the door. 
INT. PRESS ROOM 
Taking in door as it opens and Mrs. Baldwin, followed by the policemen, comes in. 
HILDY (leaping forward) Mother! 
MRS. BALDWIN (pointing out Burns to the officers) That man there! 
HILDY (hugging Mrs. Baldwin) Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me. 
Mrs. Baldwin indignantly shakes her off. 
HARTMAN What's the idea here? 
POLICEMAN This lady claims she was kidnapped. 
HARTMAN What? 
MRS. BALDWIN They dragged me all the way down the stairs -- 
HARTMAN Just a minute. Did -- did -- (points to Burns) -- this man have anything to do with it? 
MRS. BALDWIN He was the one in charge of everything! He told them to kidnap me! 
BURNS (amazed) Are you referring to me, Madam? 
MRS. BALDWIN You know you did! 
HILDY Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you? 
BURNS Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun. 
HILDY In a way. 
BURNS (laughs) I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy. 
HILDY We've certainly been in some swell jams. 
BURNS Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary? 
HILDY Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews! 
BURNS Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we? 
HILDY (laughing) We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week. 
BURNS In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach. 
HILDY Don't remind me. That's how we happened to -- 
She breaks off. There is a moment's pause. 
BURNS Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee. 
HILDY That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours. 
BURNS (glancing at the clock) Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself. 
HILDY Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter. 
BURNS Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning. 
HILDY Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter -- 
BURNS He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour? 
HILDY I don't know what to do, Walter. 
BURNS Flip a coin. 
HILDY All right. (takes coin from her bag) Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready? 
CLOSEUP BURNS 
gazing nervously at the hand holding the coin. 
BURNS Ready. 
CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY 
She flips and catches the coin. She holds it tightly clasped in her hand, afraid to look. They stare at each other a second. 
BURNS (nervously) Well -- what is it? 
HILDY (almost breaking) What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it! 
She puts the coin away without looking at it. Burns rushes to her, tries to take her in his arms. 
BURNS Hildy! 
HILDY (furiously) Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you! 
BURNS (softly) Then why are you doing it? 
HILDY Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!

CAMERA DRAWS BACK FURTHER to the by-line -- 
By Hildegarde Johnson. 
CAMERA DRAWS BACK STILL FURTHER to disclose Burns and Hildy looking at paper on Burns' desk. 
BURNS (enthusiastically) The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy! 
HILDY (grimly) Thanks. 
BURNS And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy! 
HILDY Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter. 
BURNS What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany. 
HILDY No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming. 
CLOSEUP BURNS 
BURNS Where'd you wire him? 
HILDY On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it? 
BURNS Sure. 
MED. SHOT 
HILDY It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open? 
BURNS Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns. 
HILDY Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
White flowers are scattered among the Well seeded grasses. An idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer... the figure is reading a book. ON THE SOUNDTRACK: In the distance, growing louder..over the Gentle clip clop of an approaching cart and horse can be heard the HUMMING OF A DEEP VOICE to the tune of "The Road Goes Ever On and On..." 
SUDDENLY! The figure in the grass sits up...looking straight at camera is a handsome young HOBBIT, with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes. This is FRODO BAGGINS...his EYES alight with EXCITEMENT! Tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth, Frodo runs off.

EXT. SHIRE LANE -- DAY 
The cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped figure in Grey.

HILL. . .JUMPING OVER LOGS... DODGING TREE BRANCHES. 
ANGLE ON: 
The shambling OLD PONY snorts and rears as... SUDDENLY FRODO appears on a bank above the cart. 
FRODO You're late. 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF glowers at the young Hobbit... 
GANDALF A Wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins, nor is he early. He arrives precisely when he means to. 
They look at each other a moment..then both start laughing as FRODO'S face breaks into a smile and he leaps on to the front seat of the cart. 
FRODO It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf! 
Next to Gandalf, we see how small Hobbits are...Frodo is 3 foot 6 inches tall. 
GANDALF You didn't think I'd miss your Uncle Bilbo's birthday? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS -- DAY 
Wide on: The cart rattles past a FIELD LUPIN being tended by 
HOBBITS. 
FRODO What news of the outside world? Tell me everything! 
ANGLE ON: 
Gandalf looks down at Frodo, a twinkle in his eye. 
GANDALF What, everything? Far too eager and curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural... 
Wide on: The cart rattles over a Stone bridge towards a Busy Hobbit Marketplace. 
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT'D) Well, what can I tell you? Life in the wide world goes on much as if it has past age. Full of its own comings and goings, scarcely even aware of the existence of Hobbits... 
Close on: Gandalf as he surveys the peaceful scene before him. 
GANDALF (CONT'D) ...for which I am very thankful. 
ANGLE ON: 
Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon Inn...towards... Wide on: The party field. Where scOrcs of Hobbits are busy preparing for the big night. 
GANDALF (CONT'D) Ah, the long expected party. So, how is the old rascal? I hear it's going to be a Party of Special Magnificence. 
FRODO You know Bilbo...he's got he whole place in an uproar. 
GANDALF Oh, well...that should please him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FRODO Half the Shire's been invited... 
Bilbo disappears into the kitchen as Gandalf looks around..enjoying the familiarity of Bag End...he turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam. He groans. 
BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D) I was expecting you some time last week. Not that it matters, you come and go as you please, always have done, always will. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BILBO (O.S.) (CONT'D) You've caught me a bit unprepared, I'm afraid...we've only got cold chicken, bit of pickle, some cheese here...ooh, no, that might be a little risky... 
Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner...it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, Gandalf smiles to himself. 
BILBO (CONT'D) Er, we've got raspberry jam and apple tart...got some custard somewhere. Not much for Afters, I'm afraid. Oh no...we're alright...I've just found some sponge cake. Nice little snack. Hope it's enough. (comes into view) I could do you some eggs if you like? 
Bilbo jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as Gandalf mysteriously appears behind him. 
GANDALF Just tea, thank you. 
BILBO Oh..right.     You don't mind if...? 
GANDALF No, not at all. Go ahead. A sudden loud knock on the front door. 
MRS. SACKVILLE BAGGINS (O.S.) 
Bilbo Baggins, you open this door..I know you're in there. 
BILBO I'm not home. 
Gandalf watches, amused as Bilbo tries to hide. 
BILBO (CONT'D) I've got to get away from these confounded relatives, hanging on the bell all day, never giving me a moment's peace. I want to see mountains again...mountains, Gandalf... and then find somewhere quiet where I can finish my book...Oh, Tea! 
GANDALF So, you mean to go through with your plan, then? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILBO Yes, yes...it's all inhand.   All the arrangements are made. 
GANDALF Frodo suspects something. 
BILBO 'Course he does, he's a Baggins...not some block headed Bracegirdle from Hardbottle! 
GANDALF You will tell him, won't you? 
BILBO Yes, yes. 
GANDALF He's very fond of you. 
BILBO I know. He'd probably come with me if I asked him. I think, in his heart, Frodo's still in love with the Shire, the woods and the fields... little rivers. Bilbo stands gazing out of the kitchen window. 
BILBO (CONT'D) I am old, Gandalf... Bilbo looks at Gandalf sadly... 
BILBO (CONT'D) I know I don't look it, but I'm beginning to feel it in my heart. 
CLOSE ON: 
Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket...gripping a small, unseen object. 
BILBO (CONT'D) I feel thin...sort of stretched, like butter scraped over too much bread. I need a holiday...a very long holiday and I don't expect I shall return...in fact, I mean not to. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BAG END -- EVENING 
Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch. Below them, final preparations are being made on the Party field. Bilbo strikes a match and lights his pipe. 
BILBO Old Toby, the finest weed in Southfarthing! 
Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the Center of Bilbo's smoke ring. 
BILBO (CONT'D) Ohhhh, (smiles) Gandalf my old friend...this will be a night to remember! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON -- NIGHT 
BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above Hobbiton...in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches. TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down from the branches...evaporating just above the up turned faces of the delighted party-goers 144 Hobbits, feasting and drinking Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories. Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff... Bilbo is greeting visitors. Frodo and SAM sit at a table drinking ale...Frodo notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit, Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away. 
FRODO Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance. 
SAM (horrified) I think I'll just have myself another ale. 
FRODO Oh, no you don't. Go on. 
Sam goes to drain his glass... suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers. 
ANGLE ON: SAM'S HORRIFIED FACE 
as he is Swept away.   Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer. 
ANGLE ON: 
Bilbo instantly vanishes. The party explodes into an uproar... the crowd leaps to its feet. 
ANGLE ON: FRODO 
staring at the empty stool in disbelief. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BAG END -- NIGHT 
The party is still in an excited uproar... some 50 yards away as we pan across a moonlit lane to the front door of Bag End. Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand. 
INT. BAG END -- NIGHT 
The door quietly closes...Bilbo materializes as he pulls a plain gold ring off his finger. Bilbo laughs as he tosses the ring in the air, then places it in his pocket. 
ANGLE ON: 
Bilbo emerges from the passage, carrying a walking stick. He finds Gandalf looming over him. 
GANDALF I suppose you think that was terribly clever? 
BILBO Come on, Gandalf!   Did you see their faces? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GANDALF There are many magic rings in the world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them should be used lightly. 
BILBO It was just a bit of fun.   Oh, you're probably right as usual. 
GANDALF You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you? 
BILBO I'm leaving everything to him. 
GANDALF What about this ring of yours?   Is that staying too? 
Close on: Bilbo...he gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece. 
BILBO Yes, yes, it's in an envelope...over there on the mantelpiece. Gandalf frowns at the empty mantelpiece...Bilbo suddenly feels his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise. 
BILBO (CONT'D) No, wait. It's here in my pocket. Isn't that...isn't' that odd now? Yet, after all, why not? Why shouldn't I keep it? 
GANDALF I think you should leave the Ring behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard? 
BILBO Well, no...and yes. Now it comes to it, I don't feel like parting with it. It's mine. I found it. It came to me! 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN. 
GANDALF There's no need to get angry. 
BILBO Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault! It's mine. My own, my precious. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GANDALF Precious? It's been called that before, but not by you. 
BILBO So? What business is it of yours what I do with my own things? Bilbo's voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed. 
GANDALF I think you've had that ring quite long enough. 
BILBO You want it for yourself! 
Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room 
GANDALF Bilbo Baggins do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks! Bilbo cowers from Gandalf, disarmed by his power...a frightened Hobbit. Gandalf's expression softens. 
GANDALF (CONT'D) I am not trying to rob you. I am trying to help you. Sobbing, Bilbo runs to Gandalf and hugs him. 
GANDALF (CONT'D) All you long years we've been friends...trust me as you once did. Let it go! 
BILBO You're right, Gandalf...the ring must go to Frodo. 
Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door. 
BILBO (CONT'D) It's late, the road is long... yes, it is time. 
GANDALF Bilbo? 
BILBO Hmmm? 
(CONTINUED)

Bilbo hesitates...reaches into his pocket.

INT. CITADEL CHAMBER, MINAS TIRITH -- NIGHT

DISSOLVE TO:

GANDALF (CONT'D) ring...it is precious to me, though I buy it with great pain... 
CLOSE ON: ELVISH LETTERING MARKS ON THE FADED OLD DOCUMENT

A large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for Frodo. Frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his Assailant. Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight. Paranoia blazes in his eyes. His clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling. Hair and beard much longer an unkempt. 
GANDALF (urgent whisper) Is it secret? Is it safe? 
GANDALF (V.O.) I don't know how long they tortured him...but amidst the endless screams and inane babble, they discerned two words.

GANDALF You cannot offer me this ring. 
FRODO I'm giving it to you! 
GANDALF Don't tempt me, Frodo. I dare not take it, not even to keep it safe. 
CLOSE ON: THE RING IN FRODO'S HAND... 
GANDALF Understand, Frodo...I would use this Ring from a desire to do good...but through me, it would wield a power too great and terrible to imagine. 
FRODO But it cannot stay in the Shire!

FRODO And the ring will be safe there?

CUT TO: 
INT. BAG END LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Frodo is preparing to leave.

FRODO Remember what Bilbo used to say...it's a dangerous business... 
Frodo and Sam continue their journey. 
BILBO (V.O.) ... it's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out your door...you step onto the road, and if you don't keep your feet, there's not knowing where you might be swept off to.

EXT. ISENGARD VALLEY -- DAY 
Gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of Fangorn. Nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant Misty Mountains, the tall black tower of Orthanc is clearly visible 
EXT. ISENGARD VALLEY -- DAY 
Gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of ISENGARD...a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains. 
SARUMAN (V.O.) Smoke rises once more from the mountain of doom...the shadow takes shape in the darkness of Mordor; the hour grows late...and Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard seeking my counsel... 
The strange tower of Orthanc...hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian...rises up in the center of the Isengard Circle. Gandalf arrives at the foot of the Orthanc Stairs. 
ANGLE ON: SARUMAN, THE WHITE WIZARD

SARUMAN Are you sure of this? 
GANDALF Beyond any doubt. 
SARUMAN So the ring of power has been found? 
GANDALF All these long years it was in the Shire, under my very nose. 
SARUMAN And yet you did not have the wit to see it! Your love of the Halfling's leaf has clearly slowed your mind. 
GANDALF We still have time...time enough to counter Sauron...if we act quickly. 
SARUMAN Time?   What time do you think we have? 
CUT TO: 
INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER -- DAY 
Saruman and Gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SARUMAN Sauron has regained much of his former strength. He cannot yet take physical form...but his spirit has lost none of its potency. Concealed within his fortress, the lord of Mordor sees all. His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth, and flesh. You know of what I speak, Gandalf...a great Eye, lidless, wreathed in flame. 
GANDALF (softly) The eye of Sauron. 
SARUMAN He is gathering all evil to him. 
SARUMAN (CONT'D) Very soon he will have summoned an army great enough to launch an assault upon Middle earth. 
GANDALF You know this? How? 
SARUMAN I have seen it. 
Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth... 
GANDALF A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman. 
Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir. 
SARUMAN Why?   Why should we fear to use it? 
GANDALF They are not all accounted for, the lost seeing-stones...we do not know who else may be watching. Gandalf throws the cloth back over the Palantir. 
FLASH IMAGE: A FIERY EYE! 
Saruman sits upon his throne.

SARUMAN The hour is later than you think. Sauron's forces are already moving...the Nine have left Minas Morgul. 
PIPPIN That was close. 
Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly. 
MERRY (groaning) Ow...I think I've broken something. 
Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle, out from his back pocket. 
MERRY (CONT'D) Oh. 
SAM (turning on Merry and Pippin) Trust a Brandybuck and a Took. 
MERRY What? That was just a detour...a shortcut. 
SAM A shortcut to what? 
Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road. 
PIPPIN (excited) Mushrooms! 
CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. He realizes they are on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind... 
SUDDENLY... THE SOUND OF HORSES HOOVES... 
FRODO I think we should get off the road. 
A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. 
FRODO (CONT'D) (more urgency) Get off the road! 
Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES is close... A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes ! Frodo freezes in terror. The RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits very still with his head bowed, listening. From inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent; his head turning from side to side. 
CLOSE ON: FRODO 
Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods. 
CLOSE ON: FRODO 
He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. The SOUND OF SNIFFING intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to side like a bird of party. 
CLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT... 
QUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS!   AND EVIL DARK TOWER...A GREAT EYE...A 
BURST OF FLAME. 
ANGLE ON:   SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN 
SAM Frodo? 
Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly slumps...as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MERRY What was that? 
Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand. 
EXT. FERRY LANE -- NIGHT 
Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the trees...slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. 
SAM Anything? 
FRODO Nothing. 
PIPPIN What is going on? 
Merry moves past pippin, toward Frodo, watching intently...Sam keeps looking around nervously. 
MERRY The Black rider was looking for something...or someone...Frodo? 
SAM Get down! 
The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline. The Four Hobbits... sprawled on the ground, holding their breath. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs. 
FRODO I have to leave the Shire...Sam and I must get to Bree. 
Merry looks at his friend...realizing Frodo is in deep trouble. 
MERRY Right...Buckleberry Ferry...follow me ! 
The Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of the forest TOWARD THEM! 
MERRY (CONT'D) There's another one!! Frodo, this way! ! 
The Hobbits run   THE RINGWRAITH SHRIEKS! 
QUICK CUTS: 
BUTTERBUR Underhill?     Hmmmm. 
FRODO We're friends of Gandalf the Grey...can you tell him we've arrived? BUTTERBUR frowns... 
BUTTERBUR (Puzzled) Gandalf...Gandalf...Oh... (recognition) Oh yes! I remember...elderly chap...big grey beard...pointy hat? Frodo nods with relief...Butterbur shakes his head. 
BUTTERBUR (CONT'D) Not seen him for six months. Frodo is shocked. 
SAM (worried whisper) What do we do now? 
INT. PRANCING PONY INN -- NIGHT 
Wide on: the noise, smokey Inn. It is dimly lit, cheifly from a blazing log fire...and crowded with a mixture of BIG FOLK, LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs. Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin are sitting at a table against the wall... clearly trying to remain Quiet and inconspicuous... Sam can't help himself...he keeps casting nervous glances around. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FRODO Sam, he'll be here.    He'll come. 
Merry ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very large mug of beer. 
PIPPIN What's that? 
MERRY This, my friend, is a pint. 
PIPPIN It comes in pints?    I'm getting one! 
Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar. 
SAM You've had a whole half already. Merry watches Pippin go. 
A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance at Frodo, then quickly look away. 
SAM (CONT'D) (tense) That fellow's done nothing but stare at you since we've arrived. 
Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur... 
FRODO Excuse me, that man in the corner, who is he? 
BUTTERBUR He's one of them Rangers; they're dangerous folk they are, wandering the wilds. What his right name is, I never heard, but round here he's known as Strider. 
FRODO (to himself) Strider. 
BENEATH TABLE: FRODO'S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE RING. 
CLOSE ON: FRODO 
Sweat runs down his brow.   The Strange hum of the Ring spills into the Soundtrack. 
"Baggins...Baggins..." a creepy whisper seems to fill Frodo's head...sound that dissolves into Pippin's loud voice: 
PIPPIN Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins...he's over there... 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN 
sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals.   Frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar. 
PIPPIN (loudly) Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin once removed, on his mother's side and my third cousin twice removed on his father's side...if you follow me. 
Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer. 
FRODO Pippin! 
PIPPIN Steady on, Frodo! 
Pippin pushes Frodo away...he stumbles backwards, and falls to the floor. At that instant, the Inn goes silent and all the attention turns to Frodo... 
CLOSE ON: 
The ring...in agonizing Slow motion we watch as it seems to hang in the air for a split second...then crashes down onto his out stretched finger. FRODO VANISHES! There is a sharp intake of breath...followed by total silence. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BREE COUNTRYSIDE -- NIGHT 
The RINGWRAITHS turn sharply in their saddles...Instantly aware that the ring is being worn. They spur their horses towards the distant lights of Bree. 
INT. "PRANCING PONY" INN -- NIGHT 
Sam looks sick; Pippin instantly sobers, realizing his folly; the brooding stranger frowns...and the inn erupts into excited babble. 
IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD: 
ANGLE ON: 
FRODO: as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of the ring: THE EXCITED CROWD ARE suddenly moving in slow motion...distorted voices...a weird photographic negative quality. FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow motion background. He suddenly clutches his head as he is hit with quick images...of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE EYE, wreathed in flames. 
VOICE OF SAURON 
There is no life here in the void...only cold...only death... FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately pulling the ring from his finger. FRODO MATERIALIZES into the real world. AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the table and Grabs Frodo by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHETWOOD FOREST -- DAY 
ANGLE ON: 
STRIDER, MERRY, PIPPIN, AND FRODO march through a gloomy, overgrown forest. Sam follows at the read leading "Bill", a scrawny pony, who is laden with supplies. 
FRODO Where are you taking us? 
STRIDER Into the wild. 
Frodo watches uneasily as Strider moves off into the cover of the trees... 
MERRY (whispered aside) How do, we know this Strider is a friend of Gandalf? 
FRODO We have no choice but to trust him. 
STRIDER But where is he leading us? 
ANGLE ON: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Strider stops, casts a glance back at Sam. 
STRIDER (CONT'D) To Rivendell, Master Gamgee...to the house of Elrond. 
SAM looks excited. 
SAM Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell! We're going to see the Elves! 
Strider leads the Hobbits through the gloom of the forest. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MIDGEWATER MOORS -- DAY 
Aerial on: Strider leading Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin across the windswept moors. The hobbits suddenly stop and unstrap their knapsacks. 
STRIDER Gentlemen, we do not stop until nightfall. 
PIPPIN What about breakfast? 
STRIDER You've already had it. 
PIPPIN We've had one, yes...but what about Second Breakfast? 
Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking his head. 
MERRY I don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip. 
PIPPIN What about Elvenses, Luncheon, Afternoon Tea, dinner...he knows about them, doesn't he? 
MERRY I wouldn't count on it. 
An apple is thrown to Merry, who deftly catches it.   Another, aimed at Pippin, catches him on the forehead. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MERRY (CONT'D) (exasperated) Pippin! 
The hobbits trudge through rain, looking tired, hungry, and miserable. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER -- NIGHT 
Saruman stands over the Palantir, his hands cupping the massive eye. 
SARUMAN (whisper) The power of Isengard is at your command, Sauron, Lord of the Earth. 
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: BLACK SPEECH FILLS THE ROOM...ADMIST THE 
HARSH, GUTTURAL WORDS THE VOICE OF SARUMAN EMERGES. 
SARUMAN Build me an army worth of Mordor. 
INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER -- NIGHT 
Saruman is seated as his ORC OVERSEER approaches. 
ORC OVERSEER What orders from Mordor, my Lord. What does the eye command? 
SARUMAN We have work to do. 
CUT TO: 
ARWEN Noro lim, Asfaloth! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FORD OF BRUINEN -- DAY 
CRANE DOWN: As the White Horse races towards Camera, to Reveal the wide river Bruinen in the foreground. 
Without hesitation, the white horse leaps into the shallow water and thunders across the Ford. The 9 Ringwraiths pull up short of the Ford, clearly nervous of the water. The white horse reaches the other side...Arwen pulls up and turns to defiantly face the Ringwraiths from across the Ford. 
WITCH KING Give up the Halfling, she-elf! She draws her sword and yells at the Witch King. 
ARWEN (yelling) If you want him, come and claim him. 
THE WITCH KING SCREECHES ANGRILY, draws his sword, and leads the Ringwraiths across the Ford. The water starts flowing faster...a distant rumble can be heard. Arwen waits until they are halfway across: she suddenly stands in the saddle arms raised! 
ARWEN (CONT'D) (Elvish) Non o Chithaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin Briunen Dan in Ulaer! (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ARWEN (CONT'D) Nin o Chitaeglir, lasto Beth daer: Rimmo nin Bruinen Dan in Ulaer! 
THE GROUND SUDDENLY TREMBLES...A MIGHTY ROAR FILLS THE AIR! 
Frodo looks up weakly...to see a vast torrent of Water flooding down the river towards the ford...as if a dam had burst! The Foaming water seems to form the shape of Dancing white horses with frothing manes! The Ringwraiths scream in terror as they are swallowed up in the deluge. Their Piercing cries are drowned in the roaring of the river as it carries them away! CLOSE ON: FRODO as he loses consciousness... 
ARWEN (upset) No, no...Frodo, no!     Frodo, don't give in...not now! 
Arwen gathers the small Hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away. 
INT. FRODO'S DELIRIUM -- DAY 
DELIRIOUS IMAGES AND SOUNDS.... 
ARWEN (V.O.) What grace is given me, let it pass to him. Let him be spared. Save him. 
IMAGE: A BRIGHT LIGHT suddenly flares...Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, gasping. 
FRODO (frightened) Where am I? 
A FAMILIAR VOICE cuts through the swirl of sound. 
GANDALF (O.S.) You are in the House of Elrond, and it is ten o'clock in the morning on October the twenty-fourth, if you want to know. 
INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM -- DAY 
Frodo's eyes flicker Open He is lying in bed next to an Open Window...Dappled sunlight plays on richly carved timbers...the sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the Vista of Fir Trees. 
FRODO (weak relief) Gandalf! 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF IS SITTING NEXT TO FRODO'S BED... 
softly puffing on his pipe.    He smiles at Frodo. 
GANDALF Yes, I'm here and you're lucky to be here, too. A few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid. You have some strength in you, my dear Hobbit. 
Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly... 
FRODO What happened, Gandalf?    Why didn't you meet us? 
GANDALF I'm sorry Frodo. 
Close on: Gandalf... troubled.   His eyes drift away. 
GANDALF (CONT'D) I was delayed. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ORTHANC SUMMIT -- NIGHT 
SARUMAN stands over Gandalf, gloating... 
SARUMAN Get up! So much for the power of the Ring or embrace your own destruction! 
With the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing to the floor. 
GANDALF There is only one Lord of the Ring. Only one who can bend it to his will...and he does not share power. 
SUDDENLY! GANDALF lurches to his feet and Throws himself off the Tower! Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from Isengard...on the Back of a GIANT EAGLE. 
SARUMAN (chilling) So you have chosen death! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SKIES OVER MOUNTAINS--DAWN 
Gwaihir the Eagle soars majestically over the mountains, carrying Gandalf towards the dawn. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM--RIVENDELL 
Frodo raises himself up and looks at Gandalf. 
BOROMIR It is a gift...a gift to the foes of Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor, held the forces of Mordor at bay...by the blood of our people are your lands kept safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy...let us use it against him! 
STRIDER You cannot wield it. None of us can. The one ring answers to Sauron alone...it has no other master. Boromir turns and looks at Strider, coolly. 
BOROMIR And what would a ranger know of this matter? 
Strider says nothing and Boromir turns away dismissively. LEGOLAS stands... 
LEGOLAS This is no mere Ranger. He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. You owe him your allegiance. 
Frodo looks at Strider questioningly...Boromir turns sharply. 
BOROMIR (quiet disbelief) Aragorn? This is Isildur's heir? 
LEGOLAS And heir to the throne of Gondor. 
ARAGORN (Elvish: with subtitles) Havo dad, Legolas...Sit down, Legolas.. 
BOROMIR Gondor needs no king. 
GANDALF Aragorn is right...we cannot use it. 
ELROND You have only one choice..the ring must be destroyed. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears. Gimli suddenly stands, excited. 
GIMLI Then...what are we waiting for? 
Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring...unharmed! Frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps in this chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him with concern. 
ELROND The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin, by any craft that we 
ELROND (CONT'D) here possess. The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom...only there can it be unmade. It must be taken deep into Mordor, and cast back into the fiery chasm from whence it came. One of you must do this. 
Stunned silence...the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice 
BOROMIR One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black gates are guarded by more than just Orcs. There is evil there that does not sleep and the Great Eye is ever watchful. It is a barren wasteland, riddled with fire and ash and dust...the very air you breathe is a poisonous fume. Not with ten thousand men could you do this. It is folly. 
LEGOLAS Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said? The ring must be destroyed. 
GIMLI And I suppose you think you're the one to do it? 
BOROMIR And if we fail, what then? What happens when Sauron takes back what is his? 
Gimli leaps to his feet! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
GIMLI I will be dead before I see the Ring in the hands of an Elf! A STORM OF ARGUMENT erupts around the room. CLOSE ON: FRODO...sound disappears as he watches in slow 
motion...the angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory fingers, his eyes move across to the ring...the hum grows louder in his head. 
GIMLI (CONT'D) (shouting) Never trust an Elf! 
CLOSE ON: THE RING fills the screen...streams of blood flow across the surface... flames flicker within the Gold Band. 
GANDALF Do you not understand? While we    bicker among ourselves, Sauron's power   grows! No one will escape it. You will   all be destroyed, your homes burnt and   your families put to the sword! 
CLOSE ON: FRODO...breathing rapidly, Caught in the grip of his hideous vision. With a huge effort or will, Frodo tears his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands...he speaks in a strong, clear voice. 
FRODO I will take it...I will take it...I will take the Ring to Mordor. 
Sudden silence...Frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces. 
FRODO (CONT'D) (quietly) Though...I do not know the way. Gandalf rises to his feet. 
GANDALF I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins, as long as it is yours to bear. 
ARAGORN If, by my life or death, I can protect you, I will. (kneels before Frodo) ...you have my sword. Aragorn steps forward...followed by Legolas and Gimli. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
LEGOLAS And you have my bow. 
GIMLI And my axe. 
Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo. 
BOROMIR You carry the fate of us all, little one. 
Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf. 
BOROMIR (CONT'D) If this is indeed the will of the Council, then Gondor will see it done. 
MERRY Quite good, Pippin. 
PIPPIN Thanks. 
CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf.... 
GIMLI If anyone were to ask for my opinion, which I note they have not, I would say we are taking the long way round. Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines of Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give us a royal welcome. Gandalf clearly thinks that is a bad idea. 
GANDALF No, Gimli. I would not take the road through Moria unless I had no other choice. 
Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying smoke in the wind. 
SAM What is that? 
GIMLI Nothing...it's just a wisp of a cloud. 
BOROMIR (worried) It's moving fast...against the wind. 
LEGOLAS Crebain from Dunland! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ARAGORN (urgently) Hide! 
BOROMIR Merry..Pippin...Sam...take cover! WIDE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what little cover 
there is...as a regiment of Large crows fly low overhead at Great speed, wheeling and circling above. As their dark shadow passes over the fellowship, a single harsh croak is heard...and the crows suddenly wheel away, back towards the south. Gandalf staggers to his feet. 
GANDALF (worried) Spies of Saruman.    The passage South is being watched. 
Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others...gesturing towards a high mountain pass. 
GANDALF (CONT'D) We must take the pass of Caradhras! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE -- DAY 
ANGLE ON: 
The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. CLOSE ON: Frodo slips on some shale...as he scrambles to his feet, the Ring falls on the ground... CLOSE ON: the ring gleaming in the snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain...he stands, the ring dangling before his eyes. He seems to grow in stature, as if absorbing its power. Aragorn warily approaches Boromir...Boromir is motionless...he stares at the ring, as if transfixed. 
ARAGORN Boromir? 
BOROMIR It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing...such a little thing. 
ARAGORN (quietly) Boromir...give the ring to Frodo. ARAGORN'S HAND moves to his sword hilt. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Ring's POV...looking up at Boromir's face. The strange hum vibrates on the soundtrack. CLOSE ON: a Weird beatific smile lights up Boromir's face...The HUM grows to a Deafening roar! Boromir suddenly snaps out of his trance and hands the ring back to Frodo. 
BOROMIR (lightly) As you wish. I care not. 
Boromir smiles at Frodo, ruffling his hair. CLOSE ON: ARAGON unhands his sword. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ISENGARD -- DAY 
Following the crows as they race deeper and deeper, passing a vista of Industry, Hundreds of Orcs and writhing Birthsacks...flying past Saruman, who stands upon a wooden Gantry. CLOSE ON: Saruman, listening to the Cries of the crows. 
SARUMAN So, Gandalf...you try to lead them over Caradhras. And if that fails...where then will you go? THE FELLOWSHIP struggles through the snow. 
SARUMAN (V.O.) (CONT'D) If the mountain defeats you, will you risk a more dangerous road? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PASS OF CARADHRAS -- DAY 
THE FELLOWSHIP are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up towards the PASS OF CARADHRAS. Legolas the Elf moves lightly across the top of the snow...he suddenly pauses. Saruman's voice sweeps by in the wind. 
LEGOLAS (urgent) There is a fell voice in the air. 
GANDALF It's Saruman. 
THUNDER RUMBLES...ROCK and Shale fall from above. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ARAGORN (urgently) He's trying to bring down the mountain. Gandalf! We must turn back! 
GANDALF No! 
GANDALF RAISES HIS STAFF...HE CHANTS INTO THE WIND. 
They fall silent. A low rolling boom rises from the depths below...growing louder...BOOM...BOOM...as if the caverns of Moria were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts nearby...Answering horns ... running feet...harsh cries... Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt... 
SAM (worried) Mr. Frodo! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword...and stares at its glowing blade! 
LEGOLAS Orcs ! 
ARAGORN (to the hobbits) Get back! Stay close to Gandalf. 
Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in his eyes. 
BOROMIR They have a cave troll! 
Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb. 
GIMLI (yelling) Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in Moria who still draws breath! 
BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in 2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits! Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn...who stumbles backwards...the huge club descends for the killing blow...suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back, spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall...a sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels over...Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it too, drops. 
SAM I think I'm getting the hang of this. 
The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest with his spear. 
FRODO Aragorn!   Aragorn! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and slammed against the wall. 
ARAGORN (shocked yell) Frodo!! 
The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee, bringing him down...Merry and Pippin jump on him...Legolas fires an arrow...and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor...Frodo appears to be dead. Close on: Gandalf, Aragorn, Hobbits looking horrified... Suddenly Frodo coughs...takes a huge breath. 
SAM He's alive! 
FRODO I'm alright. I'm not hurt. 
ARAGORN You should be dead. That spear would've skewered a wild boar! 
GANDALF I think there's more to this hobbit than meets the eye. 
Frodo open his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest.   The Troll Spear did not pierce the mithril." 
GIMLI Mithril! You are full of surprises, Master Baggins. 
BOOM. BOOM. BOOM     the sound of the drums rings out again! Gandalf turns to the others. 
GANDALF To the bridge of Khazad-dum!

GANDALF This way!

They hurry towards a distant door...as Goblins start scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches! Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army that's rushing toward them! SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills the air! A fiery light dances down the hallway... the pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. They back Fearfully away from the approaching beast...melting into the darkness. 
BOROMIR What is this new devilry? 
A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall..the ground shakes...an unearthly sound rumbles... 
GANDALF (quietly) A Balrog..a demon of the ancient world! This foe is beyond any of you! (urgent yell) Run! Quickly! 
CUT TO: 
INT. STAIRWAY OF KHASAD-DUM, MORIA -- DAY 
The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40 foot man-beast, with a mane of flames! In one hand is a blade...like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a WHIP of many thongs. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway...Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff. Close on: Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned. 
GANDALF Lead them on, Aragorn.   The bridge is near. 
Aragorn hesitates...Gandalf looks at him. 
GANDALF (CONT'D) Do as I say; swords are no more use here. 
THE FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up Frodo..leaping across a gaping chasm. A NARROW BRIDGE, spanning a bottomless pit...Gandalf yells to the others: Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm. 
GIMLI Nobody tosses a dwarf! The BALROG smashes through the wall and spreads its vast wings. (MORE) 
CONTINUED: 
The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES. Deadly arrows aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the Elvish captain steps forward... he looks at Gimli with disdain. 
HALDIR The dwarf breathes so loud we could have shot him in the dark. 
ARAGORN (Elvish: with subtitles) Haldir of Lorien, we come here for your help. We need your protection. 
GIMLI Aragorn! These woods are perilous. We should go back. 
HALDIR You have entered the realm of the Lady of the Wood. You cannot go back. 
Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo. 
HALDIR (CONT'D) Come, she is waiting. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LOTHLORIEN HILLTOP -- DAY 
Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top.   They look with wonderment at the vista spread before them. 
Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees, taller than any others...Nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a Beautiful City. It Gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun..green, gold, and silver. To the east of Caras Galadhon, the Woods of Lorien run down the pale gleam of Anduin, the great river. Beyond the River, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The Sun that lies on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CELEBORN'S CHAMBER, CARAS GALADHON -- NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP 
step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the might Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty. Celeborn looks hard at Aragorn... 
CELEBORN Eight there are, yet nine there were set out from Rivendell. Tell me, where is Gandalf, for I much desire to speak with him. 
Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn. 
GALADRIEL (V.O.) (softly aloud) ...he has fallen into shadow. Galadriel looks to Aragorn. 
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) The Quest stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to the ruin of all...Yet hope remains while the company is true. 
Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam. 
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go now and rest for you are weary with sorrow and much toil. Galadriel's eyes turn to Frodo...her voice fades. 
GALADRIEL (CONT'D) Tonight you will sleep in peace. (whispered v/o) Welcome, Frodo of the Shire... CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at GALADRIEL. SUDDEN INSERT: GALADRIEL as she is on the other 
side... Powerful, divine...no longer of this world..a Piercing white light surrounds her.

CUT TO: 
EXT. CARAS GALADHON LAWN -- NIGHT 
Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL SINGING drifts down from the trees above. 
LEGOLAS (sadly) A lament for Gandalf... 
MERRY What do they say about him? 
LEGOLAS I have not the heart to tell you. For me, the grief is still too near. Boromir is sitting alone...Aragorn approaches him. 
ARAGORN Take some rest..these borders are well protected. 
Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face. Aragorn kneels down beside him. 
BOROMIR I will find no rest here. I heard her voice inside my head...she spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor, and she said to me: "Even now, there 
BOROMIR (CONT'D) is hope left. But I cannot see it...it is long since we had any hope. 
CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair. 
BOROMIR (CONT'D) My father is a noble man, but his rule is failing and our..our people lose faith. He looks to me to make things right...and I would do it, I would see the glory of Gondor restored. Have you ever seen it, Aragorn? The White Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, its banners caught high in the morning breeze...have you ever been called home by the clear ringing of silver trumpets? 
ARAGORN I have seen the white city..long ago. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes heart, 
BOROMIR One day our paths will lead us there, and the tower guards shall take up the call "the Lords of Gondor have returned." 
Aragorn returns Boromir's smile...betraying his disquiet sadness only when Boromir looks away. 
CUT TO: 
LATER.... 
The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Gimli is snoring loudly. CLOSE ON: BARE FEET tread soundlessly across the lawn. CLOSE ON: Frodo's eyes flicker open...as if by instinct. GALADRIEL, her White dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her...as if drawn by an invisible force. 
GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT'D) May it be a light for you in dark places, when all other lights go out. 
EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY 
The boats pass into the great river Anduin. The Three Elven boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees slowly give way to a brown and withered land. 
EXT. FOREST -- DAY 
The Uruk forces are running through the trees with deadly purpose. 
EXT. RIVER ANDUIN -- DAY 
A flock of birds circle high above, Black against the pale sky. Aragorn watches them with concern. 
EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN--DAWN 
The Three Elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge in the Pre-dawn light. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly paddling in the stern. 
ARAGORN (quietly) Frodo. 
Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Wide on: Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300 foot pinnacles on either side of the river...carved images of Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power and majesty. 
ARAGORN (CONT'D) The Argonath... 
Close on: Aragorn...strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself. 
ARAGORN (CONT'D) (deeply moved) Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old...my kin. 
The fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes them through the narrow gap between the Statues' feet. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Wide on: Craning up past the statues vast crumbling heads, to reveal a large lake only a mile down river... 
EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL -- DAY 
ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP 
As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded shore. 
ARAGORN We cross the lake at nightfall, hide the boats and continue on foot..we approach Mordor from the North. 
GIMLI (gloomy) Oh, yes, just a simple matter of finding our way through Emyn Muil, an impassable labyrinth of razor sharp rocks. And after that gets even better...a festering, stinking marshland, far as the eye can see. 
ARAGORN That is our Road...I suggest you take some rest and recover your strength, Master Dwarf. 
GIMLI (indignant) Recover my... 
Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency. 
LEGOLAS We should leave now. 
ARAGORN No. Orcs patrol the Eastern shore. We must wait for cover of darkness. 
LEGOLAS It is not the Eastern shore that worries me. 
Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest... 
LEGOLAS (CONT'D) A shadow and a threat has been growing in my mind. Something draws near, I can feel it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means. Sam has slumped asleep...Merry dumps a small pile of kindling at Gimli's feet... 
MERRY Where's Frodo? 
Sam sits up with a start...Aragorn's head snaps round..his eyes fly to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed. CLOSE ON: ARAGORN.... as he realizes Boromir has gone! 
EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN -- DAY 
Frodo is walking beneath the trees...lost in thought. His feet hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab...his eyes follow an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the summit of Amon Hen...the seeing seat. A CRACKLING SOUND! Frodo freezes.... 
BOROMIR (quietly) None of us should wander alone; you least of all. So much depends on you...Frodo? 
Frodo turns slowly...he stares at Boromir, tense, cautious. 
BOROMIR (CONT'D) I know why you seek solitude. You suffer, I see it day by day. Are you sure you do not suffer needlessly? 
Frodo stands silent for a moment..the murmur of the Wind in the trees and the distant roar of the falls of Rauros can be heard 
BOROMIR (CONT'D) Let me help you. There are other ways, Frodo..other paths that we might take. 
FRODO I know what you would say, and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart. 
BOROMIR Warning?   Against what? 
Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, he pulls himself up. 
ARAGORN (CONT'D) (yells) Run! Run!! 
Frodo backs away into the trees...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto Amon Hen behind Aragorn! 
Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman... he brings two down with his sword...leaping into the ruins as others close in on him. Frodo scrambles down the hillside, away from the fight. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Despite his bravery, he is quickly surrounded... SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow. Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his might axe. 
EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE -- DAY 
Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heave feet thunder down behind him. 
SAM Mr. Frodo! 
Sam looks around for Frodo. CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his URUKS. 
LURTZ Find the Halflings ... find the halflings! 
Frodo stumbles and falls...quickly he crawls behind a tree...above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the forest rings out. 
MERRY (O.S.) (urgent whisper) Frodo! 
Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few feet away. 
MERRY (CONT'D) Hide here, quick! 
PIPPIN Come on... 
Frodo looks at his friends... slowly shakes his head, a great sadness in his eyes... 
PIPPIN (CONT'D) What's he doing? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Merry's eyes meet Frodo's.        Understanding. 
MERRY (softly) He's leaving. 
PIPPIN No! 
Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo...Merry grabs at his arm. 
MERRY Pippin! 
THE ECHO OF BOROMIR'S HORN reaches Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli...they are battling their way down the Slopes towards the lake. 
LEGOLAS The horn of Gondor! 
ARAGORN Boromir! 
Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling URUK-HAI in his path...while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear guard action. MANY URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he tries to protect Merry and Pippin... 
BOROMIR Run!   Run! 
Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another arrow...and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI. 
MERRY & PIPPIN Aaaaagh!      Boromir! Boromir! 
Lurtz aims his bow at Boromir's heart... suddenly Aragorn charges at him, smashing the Bow with his sword. They lock into a deadly battle. Aragorn cuts Lurtz down and races towards Boromir, who lies slumped against a tree...URUK-HAI arrows sticking out of his chest. At least 20 dead URUK-HAI lie heaped around Boromir. His horn lies at his feet...Cloven in two. 
BOROMIR (painful gasp) They took the little ones... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) BOROMIR (CONT'D) Aragorn quickly tries to staunch the flow of Blood from Boromir's shoulder. 
BOROMIR (CONT'D) (panicked) Frodo...where is Frodo? 
ARAGORN I let Frodo go. 
Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze. 
BOROMIR Then you did what I could not.   I tried to take the ring from him. 
ARAGORN The ring is beyond our reach now. 
BOROMIR Forgive me, I did not see..I have failed you all. 
ARAGORN No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You have kept your honor. Aragorn tries to bind Boromir's wound. 
BOROMIR Leave it! It is over...the world of Men will fall and all will come to darkness and my city to ruin..Aragorn.. 
ARAGORN I do not know what strength is in my blood, but I swear to you... I will not let the White City fall, nor your people fail... 
BOROMIR Our people...our people... 
Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand.   Boromir's fingers tighten around the hilt. 
BOROMIR (CONT'D) I would have followed you, my brother...my captain, my King. Aragorn lays Boromir down. He is dead. 
ARAGORN Be at peace, son of Gondor. Aragorn bends and Kisses Boromir's forehead. (MORE)

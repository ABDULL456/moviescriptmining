THE SANDLOT KIDS 
Written by

A FADED KODACHROME PHOTO 
Of the 9 best (11-year-old) buddies that ever lived. On a makeshift baseball diamond - a sandlot... circa 1962: 
SCOTTY SMALLS, studious-looking; ALAN "YEAH-YEAH" McCLENNAN, little, hyper; HAMILTON "HAM" PORTER, tubby with a huge smile; KENNY DeNUNEZ, handsome bean pole; TOMMY "REPEAT" TIMMONS and his brother TIMMY; BERTRAM GROVER WEEKS, wearing inch- thick horn rims; JEFF "SQUINTS" PALLEDOROUS, a transistor radio plug wedged in his ear; and BENNY RODRIGUEZ, leaning on Scotty's shoulder, sporting the world's all-time hottest sneakers... P.F. Flyers. 
One palm up, together like the 9 musketeers they're holding forward a baseball... with a mysterious smudge. 
NARRATOR Everyone's got that one summer when they were a kid... a summer so perfect, that it stays with them forever. It stays caught in time, like Camelot. pause That summer is like a book with a million blank pages that you get to fill with the greatest story you could ever dream up. (BEAT) This is a story about a legend. And for us, that summer was the one when the legend got made. 
WE CLOSE IN TIGHT on the black smudge, which becomes: 
A SERIES OF B&W PHOTOS & STOCK FOOTAGE 
GEORGE WASHINGTON crossing the Delaware. DANIEL BOONE in frontier buckskins. ABE LINCOLN giving the Gettysburg address. FREDERICK DOUGLAS orating from a podium. SITTING BULL in his splendor. THE WRIGHT BROTHERS at Kitty Hawk - this photo blends to news reel stock footage of the actual launch. The following also blend to stock: JOE LOUIS clobbering MAX SCHMELLING. JESSE OWENS in the '32 olympics. ALBERT EINSTEIN scrawling on a chalkboard. CHARLES LINDBERG and his Spirit of St. Louis land in Paris. As the waiting throngs cheer WILDLY: 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) Everybody sometime in their life has met a real live hero. (MORE) 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) They're not exactly a dime a dozen, but there's plenty of people who've done real great things. But hardly anyone has ever met a certified Legend, because most of them are dead before they get voted one. 
CHUCK YEAGER in the X-1 breaking the sound barrier. MACARTHUR stepping ashore, pipe clenched. JIM THORPE playing football. ELVIS PRESELY on stage in hep-cat duds. NEIL ARMSTRONG setting foot on the moon. 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) So, to actually be there at the moment one gets made... well, forget about it. It never happens. Almost never... To understand how it all got started, you have to go back... 
WE PULL BACK FROM THE MOON - like a baseball in the sky. 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) ...to the all-time, hands down, complete and undisputed Legend that ever lived. 
A BASEBALL in someone's hand. WE PULL BACK FROM IT. 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) In any language, in any country, in any world. The Sultan of Swat. The King of Clout. The Great Bambino. You have to go back to... 
BABE RUTH is holding the baseball. 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) ...The Babe. (BEAT) There's never been anyone greater than The Babe. And when he called his famous full count homerun in the 1932 world series, he made sure he'd live forever. 
THE BABE 
hits a homerun. Settles into his signature, locomotive basepath chug. 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) And it's a good thing he became immortal, because without him, what happened that summer, absolutely never (MORE) 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) would've happened. Weird thing was, before I moved to the neighborhood, I had no idea who he was. And he played a game I knew nothing about. 
SLO-MO - THE BABE'S CLEATS 
send up chalky dust at each STEP. His foot hits home plate - taking us 30 years into the future. The Babe's antiquated leather cleat becomes... 
EXT. DODGER STADIUM - 1962 - DAY - STOCK 
...the cleat of basepath speedster MAURY WILLS. 
NARRATOR Fourteen years later, after The Babe was gone, there was another guy who had something to do with the legend getting made too. A guy who set a record that summer that was so awesome, some people still don't believe it. 
WILLS TAKES OFF, STEALING 3RD 
so fast that no one knows he's gone. The Pitcher fires to rd. The 3rd BASEMAN gloves the dirt. The UMPIRE wings the air. 
UMPIRE Safe! 
WILLS' CLEAT becomes 
THE P.F. FLYER SNEAKER of... 
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND - 1962 - DAY 
...BENNY RODRIGUEZ, as he steps up to the plate. 
THE PITCHER 
fires. 
BENNY 
cranks one deep to right. He tears around the bases like lightning (this kid is real fast). He rounds 3rd. The ball comes in home - cutting him off. He's caught in a pickle. FROM 
BEHIND THE CHAIN-LINK BACKSTOP 
YEAH-YEAH, HAM, DeNUNEZ, REPEAT, TIMMY, BERTRAM and SQUINTS come unglued and crowd the basepath. 
HAM PICKLE! 
BENNY 
pickles the CATCHER and 3RD BASEMAN. He feints n' rubba-legs them out of position. He sprints for home. Safe! Just as he crosses home plate 
SQUINTS 
pulls his transistor radio ear plug out. 
SQUINTS Thirty-one! Maury Wills just stole number thirty-one! 
remains undercover, but he's bustin' to join in. 
THE GANG 
never notices him. As they work: 
HAM Fifth grade's history, man. A hundred days, man. A Hundred days of baseball. All Day, everyday, as much as we can. That's the best. 
TIMMY We got all summer. 
REPEAT We got all summer. 
BENNY Let's play. 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-Yeah... let's play. 
The guys round up in the infield. As they play catch, they spread farther and farther apart... until they've each taken up the position they most like to play. They fit the paltry little diamond; scrappy, happy kids. 
EXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK 
Tract homes - everybody's got a different thing going in the front yard. The guys (sans Timmons') split up toward their homes - slappin' gloves, "so-longing" for the night. 
NARRATOR Everyone but the Timmons twins lived on my new block. 
FROM HIS DRIVEWAY 
Scotty, shuttling moving boxes to his garage, watches them go. 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) They lived in a house by the sandlot and had the world's greatest tree house, because their dad was a contractor. 
FROM BENNY'S PORCH 
Benny is the last to go in. He sees Scotty watching. So, he nods... just a little. 
THE BLOCK 
clears to empty. The street lamps arc on, drawing soft white circles on the sidewalks. FROM THIS HEIGHT, they look like baseballs dotting the neighborhood. 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) Even before I knew any of them I envied that tree house... 
INT. BENNY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
A shrine to the pastime. Pennants, magazine pictures, game programs, baseball cards, a whole section of Maury Wills, radiating from a picture of Wills caught in a pickle. 
NARRATOR ...later, it would become second only to Cape Canaveral as a command post for history. (BEAT) When I moved in that summer, I'd never played baseball, but it wasn't too tough figuring out who these guys' heroes were. So, after a week of watching... I figured baseball seemed like the best way to get in with them. 
BENNY'S 
in bed, oiling his glove, staring out his window at Scotty's house. Taped to his footboard is the most important picture of all... a picture of The Babe. 
INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Jr. Chemistry set. Heath Kit gadgets. An unbelievable Erector Set contraption with little motors and stuff. An autographed picture of Mr. Wizard. Scotty's pj'd at his erector set table, bothered and unhappy. This stuff is too damn easy for him. He whips on a last bolt and connects the itty-bitty motor. SWITCHES ON 
THE CONTRAPTION 
a tiny scoopelvator snatches up a white marble. Drops it on a roller coaster track. The marble whips around corners and 
loop-da-loops... lands in a mini-catapult. Another motor draws it back via a winding string. Boy Scout camping-knife scissors ratchet in - snip the string - the catapult fires. 
THE MARBLE 
leaps a little green fence and WONK! Ouuuhhh! beans 
HIS MOTHER (HAVING JUST COME IN) 
right in the forehead. 
BEDROOM 
Scotty winces at the shot. 
SCOTTY Sorry, Mom. 
MOM I thought we agreed we'd take this apart... and not spend so much time in here. 
SCOTTY (FEELING LOW) I know - but it's just nighttime. 
MOM Scotty, have you made any friends yet? 
SCOTTY No. 
MOM Why not, honey? 
SCOTTY 'Cause I'm still "new." 
MOM Honey, I don't want you sitting in here all summer fiddling with this stuff, like you did last summer... and the one before that. (BEAT) Scotty, look at me. I know you're smart, and I'm proud of you. But you have to get outside, you have to... play. 
She sits across from him, trying to get through. 
MOM (CONT'D) I want you to get out in the fresh air and make friends. Run around and scrape your knees. Get dirty. Climb trees and hop fences. Get in trouble for crying out loud. (BEAT) Not too much, but some. You have my permission. Now how many mothers do you think say that to their sons? 
SCOTTY None mothers I guess. 
MOM I want you to make friends this summer, Scotty. Lots of them. 
SCOTTY I know, but I don't - I'm no good at anything. Face it, Mom, I'm just an EGGHEAD - 
MOM - and you'll always be just an egghead with an attitude like that. So promise me, alright? 
Mom comes in behind Scotty. 
MOM Bill, can't you take a break and teach him now? 
SCOTTY Mom, it's okay - (NOBODY'S LISTENING) 
BILL Honey, I said I would and I will. I'm just under the gun here, ya know? 
SCOTTY Mom, really - 
MOM - How long could it take? You can't spare a half hour to show him? 
Bill drops his pen. Checks his watch. A lost battle here. 
BILL (ANNOYED) Fine. Alright. I'll get my glove. Come on. 
Bill exits past them. Scotty's been "Mom-embarrassed." She looks at him: 
MOM (CLUELESS) There. See. Told you so. 
Scotty shuffles out back, shaking his head. 
EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 
Bill slides his hand into his glove. He warms up the cradle, POPPING the "hardball" into the palm. 
SCOTTY 
stands ready to "learn" on the other side of the yard. Appropriately pitiful in "trout" cap and toy glove. 
BACKYARD 
BILL Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where it goes. Okay? 
SCOTTY Yeah, okay, I think so. 
Bill throws one to Scotty. The toy glove goes up to the right. The ball sails by to the left. 
SCOTTY (CONT'D) Darn. Sorry. 
Bill's a little amazed at that one. He checks his watch. 
BILL That's alright, just throw it back. 
Scotty eagerly retrieves it. Turns to throw - deja vu - he runs over, hands Bill the ball. 
SCOTTY Here. 
He runs back across the yard. Turns 'round again. Holds his glove up stiffly. 
SCOTTY (CONT'D) Okay. I'm ready. 
Bill cannot believe this. Checks his watch again. 
BILL Keep your eye on the ball. Put the glove up where the ball goes. 
He throws again. The ball bounces off the toy glove - breaks the webbing. 
SCOTTY Darn. My glove got - 
BILL - not bad. Right side at least. Now, just throw it back this time. 
SCOTTY But my glove - 
Bill's looking at his watch again. Scotty fetches the ball - gulps - "flips" it back. 
BILL (DISBELIEF) Oh, my God. 
EXT. THE BLOCK - SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Benny comes out of his house. From the sidewalk 
BENNY'S POV 
up the side of Scotty's house into the backyard. He can see Scotty. Only Scotty. Standing there game as hell, trying to catch balls that seem to be coming too fast. The ball comes. Scotty ducks. The ball hits the block wall behind him, caroming back toward where we assume Bill is throwing from. 
BENNY'S 
drawing the wrong conclusion. 
EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 
Scotty's still game. Bill's at ropes end. Check his watch again. 
BILL Alright, Scott, listen, this one's gonna come right at you, easy, okay? 
SCOTTY 'Kay. 
BILL Just keep your eye on the ball and put your glove up. You'll catch it. 
SCOTTY Okay. 
BILL 
throws. 
THE BALL 
comes slowly forward. 
EXT. REAR OF FIVE & DIME - DAY 
Benny and Scotty come upon the gang (all their mouths are full a' bazooka) as Ham's chompin' on a candy cigar doing a BABE IMITATION: 
HAM Hey! Check me out! I'm the Great Bambino! 
The gang laughs. 
SCOTTY (OVER EAGER) Who's that? 
The gang stifles. They're none-to-pleased. Ham sees why. The new kid... "flipper." Eight pairs of eyes burn holes in his little soul. 
HAM What?... (BEYOND HIM) What did he say? 
BERTRAM Were you born in a barn, man? 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, what planet are you from? 
SQUINTS You never heard of The Sultan of Swat?! 
DENUNEZ The Titan of Terror! 
TIMMY The Colossus of Clout! 
REPEAT The Colossus of Clout! 
BENNY (even he's amazed) The King of Krash! 
NARRATOR I had no idea who they were talking about. But there was no way I could let them know that... so, I lied. 
SCOTTY Oh! The Great Bambino! Of course. I thought you said The Great Bambi. 
HAM (SHIVERING) That wimpy deer? 
SCOTTY Ah, yeah - I guess. Sorry. 
The gang goes SILENT. They spit - they're tough. Scotty dribbles - he's wimpy. 
BENNY (W/MOUHTFUL) So, Scott, this is Ken DeNunez; Alan McClennan, we call him Yeah-Yeah; Hamilton Porter, we call him Ham; Tommy and Timmy Timmons, Bertram Grover Weeks, and Mike "Squints" Palledorus. (TO GANG) He's Scott Smalls. 
SCOTTY Hi. 
The gang just stares. 
BENNY He's gonna play with us. He makes nine. Now we got a team. 
EXT. SANDLOT - DAY 
The pack follows Benny onto the diamond. Scotty trails after them. 
BERTRAM Why'd you bring him for, Benny? 
BENNY 'Cause there's eight of us, and he makes nine. 
BERTRAM Yeah, so would my sister, but I didn't bring her! 
BENNY With nine Guys we got a whole team. 
HAM No, with Elswenger we had a whole team, and Elswenger could throw! 
DENUNEZ He ain't game, Benny. He can't throw for nothin'. 
Scotty drifts off by himself. He can hear what's exchanged. 
TIMMY Benny, you already play all the empty positions since Elswenger moved to Arizona. 
BENNY And now I get to rotate 8 positions instead of 7. I need the practice. 
SQUINTS No you don't. It's stupid, Benny. The kid's an L-7 weenie. 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, Oscar Mayer even. 
BENNY Oh yeah, Squints, and you're Willie freakin' Mays. You catch like a dork - anybody ever bust your chops about that? 
SQUINTS (PALTRY EXCUSE) No, but I'm - ya know, I'm - 
BENNY - and you run like a duck, Yeah- Yeah. 
YEAH-YEAH (IT'S TRUE) 'Kay-'kay... But I'm - 
BENNY - part-a the game. 
SQUINTS (DEFENSIVE) Right. 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah. 
BENNY How come he don't get to be? 
Nobody's got an answer for that one. Base up you blockheads.) 
THE GANG 
hits the field. Their suspicious glares aren't lost on 
SCOTTY 
standing off by himself, kinda lost. Benny comes over. 
BENNY (CONT'D) You take right field, Smalls. 
gives him a "Thumbs Up." The significance of this is only outweighed by his sudden fear, when... 
SCOTTY 
glimpses something. 
SCOTTY'S POV 
of some great, lumbering thing moving past a crack in those green fiberglass panels. 
EXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK 
In good spirits, the guys break off to their houses. 
SCOTTY & BENNY 
split up in the middle of the street between their homes. 
SCOTTY Thanks. 
Already at his door, Benny just raises his glove in answer. 
SCOTTY (CONT'D) Wait, here - your glove. 
BENNY Keep it. 
INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Scotty opens a new writing tablet, and titles the page: "Baseball Stuff to Remember." He writes: "1. The Great Bambino?" He hasn't got a clue. 
EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY 
Benny coaches Scotty. Correct batting stance and swing. Benny thumb-flicks bottle caps at Scotty from a coffee can full. They're tough to hit. But soon Scotty's tagging every one of them. 
THE SUN SETS. 
EXT. SANDLOT - DAY 
DeNunez fires - fastball. CRUNCH! 
SCOTTY 
tags it. The ball sails over 
SQUINTS' 
Head in center. From left field 
BENNY 
gives Scotty another "Thumbs Up." The kid's in. 
EXT. SANDLOT - DAY - LATER 
Squints arrives with a box of baseball cards. 
NARRATOR Everyday, first thing, we'd all pick a card from what we called "The Dugout." 
Squints shakes it up. Everybody picks one. 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) It was just a shoe box, but whoever we picked, we got to be when it was our ups. One day, when Ham took his pick a little too seriously, the guys let me in on the world's most terrifying secret... 
BENNY Bingo! Maury Wills! 
SCOTTY Mickey Mou - ah, Mantle. 
YEAH-YEAH Say hey, Willie Mays. 
DENUNEZ Stan Musial. 
TIMMY Lou Brock. 
REPEAT Lou Brock - I mean, Luis Aparicio. 
BERTRAM Frank Robinson. 
SQUINTS Oh... Bob Uecker. 
HAM Hank Aaron. I'm up. 
EXT. SANDLOT - DAY - MINUTES LATER 
The gang "peppers" 
HAM 
(at home plate) mercilessly. 
DENUNEZ 
pitches - strike. Pitches again - strike. Delivers and 
HAM 
takes a Ruthian cut at it. CONNECTS to deep right. 
SCOTTY 
tracks it. 
Ham's brought personal s'mores supplies. 
HAM Wanna s'more? 
SCOTTY Some more of what? 
HAM No. You wanna s'more? 
SCOTTY I haven't had anything yet, so how can I have any more of nothing? 
HAM You kill me Smalls. Look, these are s'mores stuff. Pay attention: (CONCOCTING) First you take the graham - you put the chocolate on the graham, Hershey's of course - you hold the chocolate on the graham while you roast the mallow- 
He does. The mallow flames to life. 
HAM (CONT'D) -then when the mallow's flamin', ya stuff it on the chocolate and cover it with the other end. (BEAT) Then, you scarf. 
Ham does. The junk squirts half way down his shirt. 
HAM (CONT'D) (BARELY INTELLIGIBLE) Kinda messy... Good though. 
Squints turns the lantern down low... 
SQUINTS Alright, listen up. (TO SCOTTY) First time DeNunez heard this story he FAINTED - 
DENUNEZ - Bull, Squints! 
BENNY You did, man. 
DeNunez shuts up. It's true. 
SQUINTS When Yeah-Yeah heard it he peed his pants. 
YEAH-YEAH Shut up, Squints - did not! 
HAM You did, man. 
SQUINTS And when The Ham heard it he barfed up two bags of marshmallows. 
HAM Liar! It was only one. 
SQUINTS So stay away from the door... you might fall out. And don't sit on your sleeping bag... you could shit your pants. (SOLEMN) Now, quiet... 
Absolute silence. Kid-reverence equals fright. 
SQUINTS (CONT'D) The legend of The Beast goes back a long time... before any of us could pick up a baseball. Back to a place called Mertle's Acres. 
DREAMY DISSOLVE TO: 
THE STORY OF THE BEAST: 
EXT. "MERTLE'S ACRES" - DAY 
A legendary place... benefitting from years of kid- embellishment: a gothic, scrapyard fortress oddly designed to keep something in not out. 
SQUINTS (V.O.) The Beast belongs to Mr. Mertle, the guy that used to own Mertle's Acres Junkyard. And nobody's ever seen him since the day it happened... 
INT. MERTLE'S ACRES - DAY 
Blurbling pockets of super-heated muck. 
BURNED-OUT SHELLS 
of twisted vehicles - strewn carcasses. A battlefield. 
OLD APPLIANCES 
that form tortured faces in the shadowy recesses. 
SQUINTS (V.O.) Mertle's Acres was a bitchin' place, that had everything you could ever imagine. 
OTHER STUFF 
like savaged shopping carts. A school bus graveyard. Scrap motorbikes. Cargo ship buoy balls. The gutted shell of a fighter plane. 
SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D) And the stuff was worth a fortune. So, one day Mr. Mertle got him this new pup from the pound. They were glad to get rid of him, on account of while he'd been there, he'd killed three dogs bigger than he was. (BEAT) That was exactly what Mr. Mertle figured he needed to protect his junkyard, 'cause people kept stealing stuff at night, when he wasn't around. 
WE DRIFT THROUGH 
a maze of dark, grimy junk-passageways. 
SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D) So he bought The Beast, and set him loose in Mertle's Acres. 
SOMETHING LOPES BY 
at the end of a passage. (NOTE: We never fully see The Beast.) 
SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D) The Beast was still just a pup of six months, but he already weighed a 150 pounds... and he kept gettin' bigger. 
A TRASH BAG 
full of meat hits the ground - disappears. SLIFFTHT! It spits back INTO FRAME... empty and tattered. 
SQUINTS (V.O.) (CONT'D) He threw The Beast a trash bag full of meat every night, and just left him alone. All alone in the whole place by himself... to grow. 
AN EYEBALL 
among a pile of broken headlights. As big as the headlights. 
FLEETING GLIMPSES OF MORE STUFF 
INT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ham drools mallow goop. His hands are fisted tight... 'mallows squirt out twixt his clenched fingers. 
REPEAT & TIMMY 
have their pillows 'round their heads like bonnets. 
DENUNEZ & YEAH-YEAH 
stare and shake. 
BERTRAM'S 
eyes are shut tight, his bottom lip shudders. 
BENNY 
gulps. 
SCOTTY'S 
sitting shattered. He checks his pants to see if he's peed them. His mallow's a briquette. It SPUTTERS and flames out. 
SQUINTS 
is proud of his story prowess. 
SQUINTS And so... The Beast sits there under that lean-to, dreaming about the time when he can break the chain and get out... dreaming of the time when he can chase and kill again. 
THE GANG 
BERTRAM See, man. That's why you can't go over there. Nobody ever has. Nobody ever will. 
HAM One kid did, but nobody ever seen him again. 
DENUNEZ That ain't true - 
HAM - yeah it is! He got eaten! 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah - that kid who went to get his kite... what was his name? 
DENUNEZ "Boogers" Fleming? 
TIMMY No. It was that guy with the warts on his face. 
REPEAT Davy "The Toad." 
TIMMY That's what I said. 
Solemnity spreads among them. Kid-reverence. 
SQUINTS Davy "The Toad" Stodenrous. 
BERTRAM Yeah, The Toad... 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, poor Toad. 
SCOTTY (WEAK) Nuh-uh... none of that's true. You guys are just - 
SQUINTS - oh, yeah?... Come here. Stick your head out the window and look down. 
Scotty goes slowly... He sticks his head out guillotinely, through the small square opening. 
EXT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Scotty's head comes out turtle-like. The tree house overhangs the common wall. 
HE LOOKS DOWN INTO 
Mr. Mertle's backyard and SEES an old footed bathtub filled with murky water. A steel pole, cemented into the center of the yard. A tow chain, snaking away from the pole and vanishing under the lean-to. Dust rises and falls from 'neath the lean-to. 
SCOTTY 
hears the ORGANIC EXHAUST that accompanies the dust... rising and falling... in POWERFUL EXHALATIONS. 
INT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Scotty pulls his head back, scared shitless. 
SCOTTY (HUSHED) He's down there! 
SQUINTS You bet he is. 
HAM Whatever goes over that fence... stays there. 
SQUINTS It becomes the property of The Beast... Forever. 
EXT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
(NOTE: Same as Sc. 54) FROM THE SANDLOT... a FULL MOON hangs ominously over the tree house; a glowing little box of debate in the scary night. 
NARRATOR I learned that more than a 150 baseballs had gone over that fence... and not one of them was ever seen again. Even when some brave kid worked up enough courage to peek over the fence. (MORE) 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) (BEAT) Because, when they went over, they vanished. (BEAT) I knew it was true, because when I looked down in there, I didn't see a single... solitary... one. 
EXT. FIVE & DIME - MORNING 
Squints and Yeah-Yeah come out of the store in a big hurry, with a new baseball in a box. They stop momentarily - open it and chuck the box. Yeah-Yeah rams his mouth full of 'zooka WHILE 
Heads are scratched. Chins are rubbed. Thoughts are thunk. 
TIMMY Most likely. 
SCOTTY Hey, guys? Has anyone ever really seen The Beast? 
THE GANG STOPS 
except Scotty, he goes forward - turns back. 
SQUINTS Look, Smalls. You ever seen King Kong for real? In person, I mean? 
SCOTTY No. But - 
SQUINTS - well, he's real right? 
SCOTTY Yeah, a'course. 
SQUINTS And he's still out there somewhere right? 
SCOTTY Yeah. 
SQUINTS See, there's just somethings that are. Ya know, stuff that it's better not to talk about... 'cause thinkin' about it just makes it worse. (BEAT) Nobody has to see The Beast to know he's there. 
SCOTTY (HORRIFIED THOUGHT) You don't think that The Beast is really... 
Motionless silence. No one's ever considered this. They suddenly realize where they are: 
EXT. MR. MERTLE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Denial kicks in as they carry on: 
GANG King Kong? Naw! God is that stupid! No stinkin' way! Oh boy, had me feelin' like a douf there for a minute! Whew, what a relief! 
EXT. THE SANDLOT ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 
FROM THIS HEIGHT WE SEE them round the corner, and carry on past the sandlot. Little debating specks, far away from us, and the cares of the world. 
HAM Hey, who d'ya think'd win in a fight, King Kong or Godzilla? 
GANG Godzilla. King Kong. 'Zilla! Kong! 'ZILLA! KONG! 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, wait a sec, maybe they'll do a movie someday and we'll find out. 
GANG Yeah. That would be cool. I'd see that. Kong would kick his ass. No way, 'Zilla's got that fire breath stuff, he'd fry the monkey! 
EXT. DODGER STADIUM - ESTABLISHING - 1962 - DAY 
The gang heads toward hallowed halls. 
INT. DODGER STADIUM - TUNNEL - DAY 
Footsteps echo as the gang walks along, alone, in awe. 
EXT. DODGER STADIUM - INFIELD - DAY 
The '62 DODGERS (and our gang's Home Team) are taking batting practice. 
THE GANG 
and a bunch of kids at the infield railing. Autograph signing. Benny sticks his glove through the crowd up to a certain player. 
NARRATOR Besides The Great Bambino, who I still had no clue about, Benny had one living hero. 
MAURY WILLS 
autographs Benny's glove. Hands it back to... 
INT. BENNY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
...Benny who's suddenly here watching a baseball game. The gang's with him. 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, here he comes. He's gonna steal second. 
BENNY Naw he ain't, not yet. 
TELEVISION - STOCK '62 DODGER GAME 
Maury Wills on 1st. Taunting the pitcher. Big lead off. 
NARRATOR A guy that would break the stolen bases record that year that had stood for as many years as there were baseball's lost to The Beast. 
THE GANG 
can't wait for Wills to go. 
GANG He's gonna go, Benny. Here he goes, man. Right now, watch, watch. There, there! 
BENNY 
leans forward seriously. 
BENNY No... not yet. 
TELEVISION - STOCK '62 DODGER GAME 
Maury Wills gets ready to steal. 
NARRATOR Maury Wills became a hero for what he did. 
gawk; an inside the park home run. 
BENNY (TO CATCHER) That's one. Get used to it. 
HIGH ABOVE FIELD, A SERIES OF ECU'S OF 
the gang belting shot after shot. Rounding base after base. Crossing home. 
EXT. VACANT LOT - DAY 
(Bob B. Soxx & The Blue Jeans "Zip-A-Dee-Do-Dah" scene.) The guys strut along, air-batting, mime-catching. Benny RIPS a momentous victory slide. 
EXT. CARNIVAL - NIGHT 
The gang comes down the midway and stops at a ticket booth for a ride we don't yet see. As they buy their tickets: 
BENNY Crack! Boom! Outta here! You see the looks on their faces? Did ya? It was like, "Duh... so that's how you play baseball." 
BERTRAM Crap! I almost forgot. Chaw! 
He holds up a pounch of chewin' 'baccy. 
THE GANG 
gathers 'round. 
BERTRAM (CONT'D) I was savin' it for a good time. 
SCOTTY What is it? 
HAM Geez, Smalls... I s'pose you don't who The Babe is either. It's chaw. Plug. Wad. Chewing Tobacco! 
Bertram passes it around. Everybody sniffs. 
SCOTTY Whadda you do with it? 
HAM You're killin' me, Smalls. You chew it, of course. 
DENUNEZ All the pros do. 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, gives ya tons of energy. 
TIMMY Let's dip. 
REPEAT Let's dip. 
Bertram pinches a too-huge wad. Stuffs it in his mouth. The bag goes around. All cud up. 
BENNY Smooth. 
HAM Juicy. 
SQUINTS Tangy. 
SCOTTY Kinda tastes like an ashtray smells. 
DENUNEZ Supposed to. 
SQUINTS Let's ride. 
The gang gets on the ride: THE ANTI-GRAV! 
EXT. CARNIVAL - ABOARD ANTI-GRAV - NIGHT 
As they ride, and spin round and round and round... the brown glop falls from their mouths. They all watch 
BERTRAM 
who turns salmon... yellow... green. Then, presumably 
EXT. ANTI-GRAV - NIGHT 
yawns breakfast, lunch, and dinner like a firehose. At least that's what WE HEAR as the ride spins vertical - that, and a host of blood curddling SCREAMS from vom-victims. As the RIDERS DISEMBARK 
A BARF CHAIN REACTION 
ensues. They all running SCREAMING from the ride and lose it. 
EXT. THE SANDLOT ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 
The gang wobbles, MOANING as they go. Ham is strangely unaffected he unpockets a fistful of some digusting glorp: 
The guys lose it. WE DRIFT off them and their predicament to 
THE HOLE 
in the green fiberglass fence. An EYEBALL - big, bloodshot and amused. GUTTURAL PANTING... The Beast is LAUGHING at them. 
EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Scotty's cod belly white and jelly fish limp, from a long bout of the chuckies. 
Bill tosses his luggage in the car trunk. Scotty's mom leans out the driver's window. 
MOM I'll be back in an hour, Scotty, I'm taking Dad to the airport. 
SCOTTY (STILL WOOZY) 'Kay. Where you goin'? 
BILL Chicago, on business for a week. Listen, Scott, while I'm gone, you're the man of the house. Understand? 
dermis flays. The string-wound innards fly into 
YEAH-YEAH'S GLOVE 
in left field. The cowhide "figure 8's" lay there in 
THE INFIELD 
like huge swatted moths. The guys gather 'round. 
BERTRAM Bitchin'. 
BENNY Naw, it ain't. 
SQUINTS C'mon, Benny, maybe two, three guys in history have ever busted the guts out of a ball. That's what the omen was. 
GANG Truly. Sure. Absolutely. Yeah-yeah, Benny. It must be so. 
BENNY All's it means is that we can't play no more. It's only noon, and I just blew the whole day for us. 
DENUNEZ No, you didn't. It's the most amazing thing I ever seen. 
BENNY Anybody got any money? (NO ANSWER) Then it ain't okay, 'cause now we can't play no more. 
SCOTTY Yeah, we can. 
BENNY What, you got 98 extra cents just layin' around at home, Smalls? 
SCOTTY No, but I got a ball. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BILL'S DEN - DAY 
A BASEBALL on a silver pedestal (Bill's baseball). Scotty's HAND ENTERS FRAME. His indecisive FINGERS almost touch the ball... then, SNATCH! 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY 
Scotty dashes across the schoolyard. 
SCOTTY (out of breath) I got it! Let's play! 
He tosses the ball to 
BENNY 
who catches it. 
BENNY Bitchin'. Your ball, your ups. 
Benny hands Scotty the bat, heads to right field, leaving 
SCOTTY 
alone at home plate with Ham (the catcher). 
BENNY 
tosses DeNunez the ball on his way by. 
DENUNEZ 
almost misses it. He rounds up, throws to 
BERTRAM 
at 1st. Bertram throws to 
TIMMY 
at 2nd. Timmy almost drops it. There's a smudge on the ball. Timmy tosses to 
REPEAT 
at 3rd. Repeat fires to 
YEAH-YEAH 
in left. The ball caroms off Yeah-Yeah's glove, comes down fast! Yeah-Yeah barehands it. Safe. He launches to 
SQUINTS 
in center. It's gonna be short! Squints sprints - Willy Mays basket catch. He throws to DeNunez. 
SCOTTY 
digs in. 
HAM Batter up! 
DENUNEZ 
fires. Scotty swings - WHIFF. Again - whif. Once more... 
BOOM! Goodnight, Irene! Scotty drops the bat. Trots for first base in "home run" fashion. 
BENNY 
backpeddles. 
REPEAT You're dead as a doornail, Smalls. 
TIMMY Nice knowing you. 
REPEAT Nice knowing - 
TIMMY - shut up, Tommy. (STUNNED) Smalls, you mean to tell me you went home and swiped a ball that was signed by Babe Ruth, and brought it out here and actually played with it? 
REPEAT And actually played with it?! 
SCOTTY Yeah, but I was gonna put it back. 
SQUINTS But it was signed by Babe Ruth! 
SCOTTY Well, who is she?! 
HAM What?! What?! (OVERCOME) What did he say?! 
DENUNEZ The Sultan of Swat! 
BERTRAM The King of Krash! 
REPEAT/TIMMY The Colossus of Clout! 
GANG BABE RUTH! 
HAM (for good measure) The Great Bambino! 
SCOTTY (that did it) OH, MY GOD! THAT'S THE SAME GUY?! 
BENNY Yeah. Smalls, Babe Ruth is the greatest baseball player that ever lived. People say he was less than a God, but more than a man. Ya know... like Hercules or somethin'. (BEAT) The ball that you just aced to The Beast is worth... well, more than your whole life. 
Scotty falls to his knees. Grabs his stomach. 
SCOTTY I don't feel so good. 
They all step back, expecting the worst. Then, they fan him with their baseball caps. 
SCOTTY (CONT'D) (HEARTFELT) We gotta get that ball back. 
BENNY When does your old man get home from work? 
SCOTTY He's gone on business for a week. 
BENNY Okay, we need 98 cents. So, everybody spread out and find some soda bottles and cash 'em in. We need a new baseball. 
CUT TO: 
A BRAND NEW BASEBALL 
Benny's hand signs B A B E R U T H across the leather in ridiculous chicken scrawl. 
EXT. FIVE & DIME - DAY 
Forgery in progress. Benny does the honors. 
DENUNEZ I dunno, Benny-man. 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, it's pretty crappy. 
SQUINTS He ain't gonna buy that, Benny. It doesn't look anything like the Babe's signature. 
BENNY It doesn't matter what it looks like. His mom's never gonna know the difference. This'll just buy us some time, ya dorks. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BILL'S DEN - DAY 
Scotty's HAND ENTERS FRAME. Little anxious FINGERS wrapped around the phony "Babe Ruth" baseball. The second the ball is back on its pedestal: 
MOM (O.S.) Scotty? 
DEN 
Scotty whips 'round like he's been slapped by a wet mackerel - Mom's in the doorway. 
SCOTTY Huh?! 
MOM Honey, what are you doing in here? 
SCOTTY Ah... just looking at Bill's - I mean Dad's baseball. 
Scotty hurries away from the "autographed" ball. 
MOM You know he doesn't like you touching his things. 
SCOTTY Yeah, I know. Sorry, Mom. 
MOM Has he ever told you about that ball? 
SCOTTY Uh - no, not really, I don't think so - no, he hasn't at all - I don't know _anything_ about it. 
MOM It's signed by Babe Ruth... 
Sweet mother of - Mom knows! Scotty may collapse. 
MOM (CONT'D) ...the greatest baseball player that ever lived. 
SCOTTY Um... really? 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - DAY 
and shove the pipe under the green fiberglass. HORRIBLE SOUNDS ERUPT from the Badlands. Dust mushrooms over the fence. The pipe draws under in FEROCIOUS JERKS. Gone. Moments. The pole sails back over the fence - bounces on the asphalt with ANGRY CLANGS. 'Tis pretzel'd. 
INT. TREE HOUSE - DAY 
Bertram arrives. Hands "it" over. How embarrassing: 
BERTRAM It ain't mine. I told you, it's my little sister's! 
A Cootie Toy. They 
ASSEMBLE THE INSECT 
putting a hunk of chewed 'zooka on each Cootie foot. Attach it to a plastic parachute - ah-ha! Genius. An airborne assault! 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - DAY 
Squints indicates "go." 
INT./EXT. TREE HOUSE - THE BADLANDS - DAY 
THE GANG 
DRIFTS THE 
COOTIE N' CHUTE 
out the tree house window. It floats silently toward the baseball. The Cootie lands right on the Babe Ruth. The gum sticks. 
THE GANG 
hauls it in. 
THE BALL 
slowly rises. Suddenly 
THE BEAST'S JAWS 
erupt from 'neath the lean-to and CHOMP the Cootie whole. The string snaps. 
THE GANG 
pulls up the frayed end. 
INT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Now a War Room. Map of the Badlands: crazed trajectories, distances to The Beast, etc. Coffee can PBX system. Cardboard periscope. X's on a calendar counting down "Bill's Return." The new retreival system: 
THREE EUREKA CANISTER VACS 
all connected. Ham's catcher's mask bolted to the end pipe for ball securing. 
EXT. TREE HOUSE - OVER THE BADLANDS - NIGHT 
Toy flashlights and BSOA lanterns hang from the structure, semi-illuminating the Badlands. 
OUT THE WINDOW 
goes the vacuumtraption, 30 feet of wobbly pipe. 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - NIGHT 
Squints directs the operation, looking 
THROUGH THE CARDBOARD PERISCOPE 
WE SEE the vacupipe-mask... 12 inches from the baseball. 
SQUINTS (O.S.) (coffee can muffled) A-okay. Roger, affirmative. Initiate retreival suction. 
INT. TREE HOUSE - DAY 
They throw eureka switch one. WEOHH! 
EXT. THE BADLANDS - NIGHT 
The baseball moves itty-bittily. 
INT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
They throw eureka switch two. WEEOOOHHH! 
EXT. BADLANDS - NIGHT 
THE BASEBALL moves a lot! 
INT. TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
They throw eureka switch three! RRRWWEEEOOOHHH! 
EXT. THE BADLANDS - NIGHT 
The baseball leaps from the ground - sticks in the catcher's mask collection basket. 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - MR. MERTLE'S FENCE - NIGHT 
SQUINTS (O.S.) We have suction! Pull it up! PULL IT UP! 
YEAH-YEAH Hey-hey, don't blame me! I didn't hit the ball over there, man! 
Silence. Yeah-Yeah considers. 
YEAH-YEAH (CONT'D) Yeah-yeah, okay. But if I say pull me up, you guys better PULL ME UP! 
Benny takes Yeah-Yeah aside. Hands him all over Ham's catcher's gear. 
BENNY Here. Put these on. 
YEAH-YEAH Wha -? Why? Whadda I need All this stuff for Benny? I mean, why a mask and a gonad Protector? 
BENNY Oh, ah, nuthin', ya know, just For, ah... Altitude leveling And stuff. Put it on. 
Benny hurries off as Timmy and Repeat approach with a frightening looking harnass assembly. Yeah-Yeah backs away: 
TIMMY Don't worry. We're professionals. 
REPEAT Our Dad's a contractor. 
EXT./INT. OVER THE BADLANDS - INSIDE THE TREE HOUSE - DAY 
HAM'S 
strapped in at the tricycle winch. 
YEAH-YEAH'S 
dangling over the lean-to. 
YEAH-YEAH (into can phone) Okay-okay, I'm right over it. Let me down - slow! 
HAM 
lets go. Oops. WHIZZZZ! 
YEAH-YEAH 
plummets. 
YEAH-YEAH (CONT'D) Ahhhh! Stop! STOP! 
HAM 
back-cranks. 
YEAH-YEAH 
comes to a twirling halt four feet off the ground. 
YEAH-YEAH'S POV 
into the lean-to. Blackness and dust. 
YEAH-YEAH (CONT'D) 'Kay-'kay, tip me, hurry up. I'm gettin' the woollies. 
Yeah-Yeah reaches... Gets it! 
YEAH-YEAH (CONT'D) Okay get me outta here! 
HAM 
struggles. 
HAM HELP! I'M LOSIN' HIM! 
YEAH-YEAH 
looks down from the guys on the tree house - back to level - "4 foot" eye-level with: THE BEAST'S MOUTH! 
YEAH-YEAH (QUAKING) H - h - help! Help! HELP-HELP- HELP! (TRYING ANYTHING) Hail Mary Father who art star light twinkle twinkle hey diddle diddle - 
INSIDE THE TREE HOUSE 
hands crank the trike wheel. Yeah-Yeah's to window level in seconds. He's got the ball! 
THE BEAST'S JAWS 
leap into view. 
THE TOW CHAIN 
goes taut. The jaws abruptly disappear. 
EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY 
The Beast's shadowy form RUSTLES contentedly under the lean- to. Yeah-Yeah dropped the ball. 
EXT. TIMMONS' BACKYARD - DAY 
Yeah-Yeah's shattered. Balling. The guys sniff. Oh no, bad news. He shoves them away: 
YEAH-YEAH Yeah-yeah, I did it! SO WHAT?! You jerks, I told you to pull me back faster! (starin' them down) You - you penises. 
Yeah-Yeah waddles away. The guys rush to hold the fence door up for him. He goes through stiff-legged (can't bend over). 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY 
Yeah-Yeah heads across the field... waddle-waddle. 
ERECTOR CONTRAPTION 
wrenching it viciously. 
THE STRUCTURE 
comes tumbling down - bending into flimsy knots as it CRASHES! 
EXT. TIMMONS' BACKYARD - DAY 
Scotty stands alone on the tree house roof... staring down into the Badlands. A little, wrecked shell of a kid, who is now dead meat. The guys look up at him sorrowfully. 
NARRATOR My life was over. Just as Bill had finally warmed up to me, and asked me to be the man of the house, I had to knock a priceless chunk of history into the clutches of a monster. Great. 
END THE BIG MONTAGE. 
EXT. THE BLOCK - DUSK 
The gang, minus Timmy and Repeat, shuffle along home without a word exchanged. 
FROM HIS PORCH 
Benny watches a dejected Scotty slowly head inside across the street. 
INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Scotty stares up at the ceiling in oceans of worry. 
INT. BENNY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
The room is dark. Benny's in bed. He clicks on a "baseball- bat" flashlight. Shines the beam toward his footboard... illuminating the photo of The Babe. 
BENNY We can't get it back, Babe. (BEAT) I'm sorry. 
Suddenly, a RACKET from inside Benny's closet. A bright LIGHT GOES ON in there. Then, smoke comes out. 
Benny jumps up on his bed - flattens against the wall. Hasn't done this in years: 
BENNY (CONT'D) M - M - Mom?... 
The closet door CREAKS open... by itself. Everything inside is oddly devoid of color. 
BENNY (CONT'D) Who's there?! 
BABE RUTH steps out of the closet. He exists in the only way any kid from 1962 has ever seen him: BLACK & WHITE. 
THE BABE Now don't go peeing your pants or nuthin', I'm just here to give ya a hand. 
The Great Bambino PUFFS on a massive stogie... the source of all the smoke. 
BENNY B - B - But, you're... 
THE BABE ...dead? Legends never die, kid. 
Benny comes off the wall. The enormous Ruth towers over him. 
BENNY You're really him. You're The Babe. The Sultan of Swat. The King - 
THE BABE - of Krash and a hundred other dopey names. Forget about that, we ain't got much time. I'm here 'cause you're in some kinda pickle, right? 
BENNY Yeah. 
THE BABE A baseball with my John Hancock on it went over a fence, and you can't get it back. Right? 
BENNY Yeah, right. 
THE BABE (clear and simple) Then just hop over there and get it. There ya go. Problem solved. (tips his cap) See ya, kid. 
The Babe turns to go back to wherever he came from. Benny grabs his arm - shocked that he actually feels something "real." 
BENNY Wait! I can't. 
THE BABE Can't what? 
BENNY Go into that backyard. 
THE BABE Why not? 
BENNY There's a Beast back there. 
THE BABE What kind? 
BENNY A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one kid already. 
THE BABE Is that a fact? Listen to me, kid. (MORE) 
THE BABE (CONT'D) Everybody gets one chance to do something great. Most people either never take the chance 'cause they're too scared, or they don't recognize it when it spits on their shoes. (BEAT) This is your "big chance," and ya shouldn't let it go by. (PAUSE) Remember those cards you got the other day? 
BENNY Sure, yeah, five Maury Wills all in the same pack. 
THE BABE What're the odds on that? 
BENNY About a zillion to one. 
THE BABE More even. Someone's tellin' you somethin', kid. And if I was you... I'd listen. 
BENNY Yeah, but what? 
THE BABE You're the one with the rubba legs. Figure it out. (BEAT) You gotta do what your heart tells you, else you'll spend the rest of your life wishin' you had. 
widen, focusing. 
WAR BREAKS OUT! 
Benny goes for the ball. 
THE BEAST'S 
knotted muscles quaver and UNCOIL. 
BENNY'S 
P.F. Flyers leave behind tiny dust roosters. 
THE BEAST'S 
claws dig deep furrows. FOG BANKS of dust spread out behind it. Forelegs gallop at flared, over-anxious angles. 
BENNY 
leaves scrambling footprints. He slides - grabs the ball - "Pops-Up" Maury Wills fashion - heads back for the fence. The ball slips from Benny's fingers. Re-grabs it - shoves the ball in his teeth, freeing his hands for the leap up the fence. 
THE BEAST 
gains. SHNAPP! Jaws SHUT like a tripped bear trap. 
BENNY 
springs off the ground. He's on the fence. 
THE BEAST 
reaches chain's end - it goes taught. Breaks! The two foot length still attached to The Beast's neck bullwhips - the chain catches Benny in the butt. 
BENNY YOWWWWW! 
He vaults over the fence. 
EXT. SANDLOT - DAY 
The gang looks up. A great shadow envelopes them. 
THE BEAST IS LOOSE! 
The guys turn to stone. Benny takes off. 
BENNY OOOOH SSSSHIT! 
The Beast tears by the guys after Benny. The two vanish out of the sandlot. 
SCOTTY What're we waitin' for?! Let's go after 'em! 
EXT. SIDEWALK - NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
Benny runs. The Beast is gaining. In its wake: dichondra lawns RIPPED to shreds. Scotty and the guys make tracks a block behind. 
EXT. FIVE & DIME - DAY 
On display: Pinwheels, Mailbox Propellers and Puddle-Jumpers. Benny flies by. The Beast follows. As they pass, contact: the whirly-gigs take off! 
INT. CAR - TRAVELING - DAY 
A MOTHER drives. In the passenger seat, her TODDLER fingers a "scooter-pie" in marshmallowy strings. 
TODDLER (BEAMING) Mommy, mommy - wook! Ah, ah - goggy! (BEAT) Big goggy. 
The Mother looks out the passenger window. 
ON THE SIDEWALK 
Benny and The Beast run even. Then pull ahead. 
EXT. "SNELGROVE'S" ICE CREAM - DAY 
Gag per storyboards - t.b.d. 
EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY 
Benny's cookin'. The Beast follows - TRASHCANS SCATTER like bowling pins. 
Scotty and the guys follow. All slow to check out the garbage bins... so many crushed beer cans. 
Benny darts in the rear entrance to a "random" building. The Beast tears after him - KNOCKING the door off its hinges. 
INT. BOYS CLUB AUDITORIUM - DAY 
ON THE MOVIE SCREEN Kong does battle with T Rex. 
BENNY 
comes sliding AT US across the waxed stage floor - from under the movie screen. He slides off the stage - into midair - lands on his feet. Splits up the aisle between the rows of folding chairs and blasts out the door. 
KIDS' HEADS 
turn to watch him. KONG ROARS! They look back at 
THE MOVIE SCREEN 
where, just as Kong proclaims himself king over the dead T Rex, 
The gang's GASPING for BREATH. And then, unbelievably 
BENNY & THE BEAST 
Are coming right at them! They race across the sandlot. Kill- anxious beast-drool splashes the seat of Benny's pants. 
THE BEAST'S 
muscles flex. 
BENNY 
just runs. He runs as if a big dog was chasing him. He lurches a step - RIP! A pants pocket flaps from an incisor. 
BENNY LOOK OUT! 
He lays down the world's all-time most perfect SLIDE. He careens toward the bottom of 
MR. MERTLE'S FENCE 
hits it and, defying gravity, RUNS STRAIGHT UP THE GREEN FIBERGLASS PANELS! 
BENNY 
jets upward, leaving smashed green fiberglass footsteps - standing out from the fence 90 degrees - the Donald O'Connor "Singin' In The Rain" trick! 
THE BEAST 
sucks air - ROARS - EXPLODES from the ground - soars, gaping maw first, right for 
BENNY 
who pushes off the top of the fence. 
THE BEAST 
GNASHES up at Benny's heels - misses by an inch. He plummets toward the Badlands. Then, the unspeakable happens, 
BENNY 
DROPS 
THE BABE RUTH AUTOGRAPH 
and comes tumbling down after the ball. 
BENNY (CONT'D) Oh noooooo! 
EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY 
Benny HITS the dirt with a gut twisting THUD! Dust everywhere. 
EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY 
The gang climbs the fence. They look down into 
EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY 
where, when the dust clears, they see 
BENNY 
holding the Babe Ruth Autograph up high like a trophy. 
BENNY I GOT IT! 
THE GANG 
hops down and races over. Suddenly, from the 
FENCETOP 
His shirt snagged: 
SCOTTY Help him! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Help him! 
THE BEAST 
is hanging from the fence. His chain has caught. He struggles - choking to death - right below Scotty. 
THE GANG 
petrifies where they stand. 
SCOTTY 
tears his shirt loose. Scrambles to where The Beast hangs. Tries to lift the tow chain free - too heavy! He'll die in seconds. 
SCOTTY Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can let him off! (DESPERATE) COME ON! 
NOBODY 
moves. They wanna but they can't! 
SCOTTY 
goes for broke. He reaches out and puts his hand on The Beast's head. 
SCOTTY (CONT'D) (CONTACT) Easy. Easy, boy. 
INT. MR. MERTLE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Fairly spartan, except for one room, where it seems that Mr. Mertle spends most of his time. He leads Benny and Scotty INTO 
THE BASEBALL ROOM 
Mr. Mertle sits at a table. Benny and Scotty stare at the tabletop. 
It holds a scale model Baseball Diamond: green felt field and little bases, outfield wall and miniature player figures. A picture on the wall of Mr. Mertle and Babe Ruth. 
SCOTTY You knew Babe Ruth? 
MR. MERTLE Yeah. And he knew me too. (BEAT) They never let us play together, but we were friends. Good friends. He was almost as great a hitter as I was. But, he'd of told you he was better. 
The picture is signed: "To Thelonius Johnson Mertle, the second greatest slugger I ever saw... Babe Ruth." 
A baseball game on the RADIO. As each play is CALLED, Mr. Mertle's hands deftly put his tiny players in the correct positions. Mr. Mertle is blind. 
MR. MERTLE (CONT'D) (HOLDING BALL) This the one that went over my fence? 
BENNY Yeah. 
Mr. Mertle brushes his fingers over the leather. 
MR. MERTLE This is an old ball, boys. Really old. (BEAT) Hercules gave it a good chewing, didn't he? 
SCOTTY (WEAK) Yes, sir. 
MR. MERTLE You sound upset, son - what's wrong? 
SCOTTY Well, you see... that ball belongs to my stepdad... and, uh - it was signed by Babe Ruth. 
Mr. Mertle shakes his head... hands the ball to Scotty. 
MR. MERTLE Hmm. Well, I'm sure your dad will understand. 
SCOTTY I don't think so. 
On the RADIO, Wills steals second. 
MR. MERTLE (TO BENNY) Son, move Maury Wills to second base for me, will ya? 
Benny moves the little figure to second base. 
MR. MERTLE (CONT'D) If he steals third that'll be number (TO SCOTTY) Helluva pickle you're in, boy. 
SCOTTY Yes, sir... 
Mr. Mertle retrieves something from a glass case. A baseball. 
MR. MERTLE I'll make you a deal. If you boys come over once a week and talk baseball with me, I'll trade you balls. 
BENNY Well, that's really nice of you... but this ball really is signed by The Babe. 
MR. MERTLE (CHUCKLES) This one really is too... and all the rest of the '27 Yankees. 
He hands his baseball to Scotty... Benny stares at it in disbelief. 
BENNY Oh my God - Murderers' Row. 
As they ogle the ball: 
BENNY (CONT'D) (AWED) Lou Gehrig... 
SCOTTY Babe Ruth. 
MR. MERTLE (SMILING) They're all there. 
Scotty hands Mr. Mertle the chewed up Babe Ruth ball. Shakes his hand. 
SCOTTY Deal. 
On the RADIO, Maury Wills steals 3rd for his 100th stolen base. Scotty notices the wall clock: 
EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Mom's car is in the driveway. Scotty goes up the walkway slowly. Benny just behind him. The gang lingers at the sidewalk. Scotty sets one foot on the 
PORCH 
and Bill comes out. He looks none-too-pleased. He towers over Scotty. The gang hangs their heads. 
BILL This better be good. 
Benny unpockets a little felt bag. Hands it to Scotty. He holds the bag up to a perplexed Bill, who opens it. He looks from Scotty to Benny and back again. Then... 
...stares down at the "Murderers' Row" ball. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SCOTTY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY 
A BASEBALL sailing through the air. SMACK! it's caught in a brand new glove. Scotty's new glove. Scotty snap throws the ball back to Bill. He and Scotty are having a great game of catch. 
NARRATOR It was weird that Benny said Babe Ruth was like the Hercules of baseball, and then The Beast's name turned out to be Hercules. (BEAT) It was also strange that Mr. Mertle had a Murderers' Row ball to replace the one signed by The Babe. 
Bill and Scotty smile as they fire the cowhide back and forth. 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) Some people might say that it was all a coincidence... but looking back at it now, it seems like everything was connected, just like me and Benny. (BEAT) It was like we were a part of the same myth as The Babe... the Myth of Baseball.

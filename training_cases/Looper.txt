Production draft 
EXT. EDGE OF CORN FIELDS - DAY 
A pocket watch. Open. Ticking. Swinging from a chain. Held by a young man named JOE in a clearing beside a Kansas corn field. Sky pregnant with rain. Waiting. He checks the watch, removes his earbud headphones, stands. Without much ceremony a BLOODIED MAN in a suit appears from thin air, kneeling before the young man. Hands and feet tied. Burlap sack over his head. Muffled screams, gagged. With no hesitation Joe raises a squat gun and blows the man apart with a single cough of a shot. 
LATER Joe loads the corpse into the flatbed of his truck. Cuts open the back of the body's jacket, revealing FOUR bars of gold taped to the dead man's back. Joe takes them. 
EXT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY 
Massive, in the middle of nowhere. Black smoke. 
JOE (V.O.) Time travel has not yet been invented. But twenty five years from now it will be. Once the technology exists, it will be relatively cheap and available to the public at large. And so. It will be instantly outlawed, used only in secret by the largest criminal organizations. And then only for a very specific purpose. Joe drives up and parks his truck, removes the wrapped corpse from the flatbed. 
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) It's nearly impossible to dispose of a body in the future. I'm told. Tagging techniques, whatnot. So when these future criminal organizations in the future need someone gone, they use specialized assassins in our present, called loopers. 
INT. INDUSTRIAL PLANT - DAY 
Cavernous and empty. Joe carries the body to an iron hatch, opens it, and dumps him in. 
JOE (V.O.) And so. Thirty years from now. My employers in the future nab the target, they zap him back to me, their looper. And I do the necessaries. So the target has vanished from the future, and I've just disposed of a body that technically does not exist. Clean. The body slides down a long chute. Vanishes in a little flare of angry red fire. 
EXT. DINER - DAY 
A sidecar roadside diner in the middle of nowhere. Joe's truck in front. 
INT. DINER 
Nearly empty, Joe at a booth listening to headphones. A waitress sets down coffee. Her bright red name tag: BEATRIX. 
BEATRIX Bon jour, Joe. 
JOE Bon jour, Beatrix. 
BEATRIX How's the French? 
JOE Slow. How's the coffee? 
BEATRIX Burnt. Cream in the coffee. White clouds boil deep down. 
EXT. FARMLAND ROAD - DAY 
Joe's truck zooms from the flat fields towards a mid sized city on the horizon. 
INT. PAWN SHOP - DAY 
Grungy, heavily fortified. Joe enters and puts his gun in a basket labeled âLOOPERS - BLUNDERBUSSESâ Slips down a narrow passage, which ends at a steel wall with a protruding duct taped camera and microphone. 
JOE Two, Jedd. 
Joe fishes the two gold bars from his jacket. A small narrow slot slides open in the wall, and gnarled old hands take the gold bars. It slides shut again. In the background the front door to the pawn shop dings open. The slot slides open and Jedd's hands push a wad of cash. Joe pockets it, and backs around Dale, another Looper. 
DALE Hey Joe. Be at the Belle tonight? 
JOE Yup. Dale hands four gold bars through the slot as Joe retrieves his gun and exits. 
DALE Four, Jedd. 
INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON 
High ceilings, big clean windows overlooking a sooty city. Joe finishes smoothing out an oriental rug and scoots a coffee table in place over it. Puts a bebop LP on a turntable. 
JOE We'll stick backstage, just meeting up. In and out. 
BIG CRAIG Packing your blunderbusses? 
JOE Hardly. Right Seth? 
SETH Hardly. I'm with Joe. Big Craig pats them down, waves them in. 
INT. BACKSTAGE 
A claustrophobic maze of twisty halls and passages. DANGEROUS MEN and half naked SHOW GIRLS weave through. Joe expertly navigates the turns, going someplace. Seth struggles to keep up. 
SETH So are we - hey - Joe has vanished. Seth stops meekly, butted by passing men. 
INT. BORDELLO ENTRANCE 
An ornate parlor, LACY WOMEN entertaining men. A velvet curtained doorway leads to back rooms. Joe lingers by the entrance, watching one girl in particular, SUZIE. Bold dark eye makeup. A BIG MAN leads her off through the curtains. Joe's eyes drop. Pained. A fat MADAME doesn't look up from her ledger. 
MADAME No loopers on Wednesday, Joe. Gat Men only. 
JOE So I've read. He ducks out. 
INT. BACKSTAGE 
Joe plods. Dale, the Looper from the pawn shop, passes fast. Curious, Joe follows. They pass Seth, who tails after them. 
SETH Hey, Joe. We leaving? Cuz, what- Joe? And Seth loses them again, butted back by passing men. 
INT. STEEP STAIRS 
A starkly lit steep stairwell leads down. Five or six young loopers gather at the top. Joe and Dale join them. 
JOE What? 
DALE Zach. In there right now, with Abe. Dale makes a quarter float above his palm. Joe rolls his eyes. 
JOE For what? 
DALE He closed his loop. This lands heavily on Joe. 
JOE No shit? The door at the bottom of the stairs opens, and ZACH, another looper, steps out. An OLDER MAN'S HAND pats his shoulder then retracts into the door. The loopers watch him in awe. 
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) There's a reason we're called loopers. 
EXT. ABANDONED LOT - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
Zach stands waiting, checking his wristwatch, gun in hand. Obviously performing a similar ritual to Joe's. 
JOE (V.O.) Time travel in the future is so illegal, that when we sign up for this job we agree to a very specific proviso. 
Zach raises his gun. 
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) If our employers in the future get busted up by the law, their first priority is going to be erasing any trace of their relationship with us ever existing. A flash of light, and a HOG TIED MAN with a sack over his head kneels in front of Zach. Zach fires, and the man's chest explodes. 
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) So. If they're busted, and if we're still alive 30 years from now, they'll find our older self and zap him back to us, like any other job. Zach rips open the back of the corpse's jacket, revealing several dozen gold bars taped to his back. 
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) This is called closing your loop. Zach freezes. Looks at the shape of the corpse's face through the sack. 
JOE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And you get paid out a mythic amount of money, and you get a handshake and get released from your contract. Enjoy the next 30 years. 
INT. STEEP STAIRS 
Zach reaches the top of the stairs, a grin on his face. 
JOE (V.O.) This job doesn't tend to attract the most forward thinking people. 
ZACH So are we celebrating? At the bottom of the stairs, a skinny young thug in ratty jeans. This is KID BLUE. 
Joe spins from the door. Considers briefly. 
JOE I can't do anything for you Seth. Seth crumples to his knees, grasping Joe's hand. 
SETH No! You gotta hide me! Joe, hide me, please Christ please Joe please hide me tell em something to buy time and I'll leave please- 
POUND POUND POUND. 
JOE Hold on! Watching Seth, Joe's face breaks in a moment of decision. He flips the lights on, and briskly pulls back his oriental rug. A FLOOR SAFE with a touch pad. He enters a code, opens it. Wide and deeper than you'd expect, lined with gold bars. Big enough for a man. Seth scrambles in. Joe takes one last look at Seth's frightened, grateful face, framed by the gold bars, then closes the safe and smooths the oriental rug. POUND POUND POUND- Joe opens the door. Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the apartment with over-eager purpose. One gat man stays outside, the other casually sits at Joe's kitchen table. Kid Blue gets in Joe's face. 
KID BLUE That took awhile. 
JOE You think it's easy looking this good? 
KID BLUE Tye's going to watch your apartment while we go have a talk with Abe. Joe grabs a jacket. 
JOE There's coffee in the tin. 
TYE Thank you. 
EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - DAWN - ESTABLISHING 
INT. STEEP STAIRS 
Kid Blue leads Joe down the stairs and into the door at their base. 
INT. WAITING ROOM 
Dingy with a few benches. In one wall three steep stairs lead to a high door. Kid Blue knocks. Muffled voice from 
WITHIN: 
ABE (O.S.) Two minutes. 
LATER Joe and Kid Blue on benches, facing each other. The Kid stares daggers and spins his gun. Joe tries his best not to engage. 
KID BLUE You know why they call that pea shooter a blunderbuss? Cuz it's impossible to hit anything farther than 15 feet, and impossible to miss anything closer. A gun for fuck up turkeys. Not like a gat. A gat has range. Accuracy. His gun spinning gets fancier. His gun meaner looking than Joe's blunderbuss, long and slim and chrome. 
JOE Alright, cut it out Kid. You're gonna blow your foot off again. The Kid almost snaps back, but then grins. 
KID BLUE You're right, it'd be real easy for it to accidentally go off. He clicks the safety off. Joe shifts uncomfortably. 
JOE C'mon. 
KID BLUE Don't disrespect a gat man, Looper. Joe stifles a chuckle. In a flash, the Kid stands and pistol-whips him across the face. Joe falls back. The Kid raises his gun at Joe. Frozen in that tableau a moment, the Kid savors his victory. Lowers his gun. 
ABE (O.S.) What the hell is going on out there- The high door swings open fast, SMACKING Kid Blue hard on the side of the head. His gun goes off, firing into the wall. Out of nowhere three gat men burst into the room, guns drawn. ABE, a sallow man in his 50s, appears in the high doorway. 
KID BLUE S'alright, s'alright. Humiliated, the Kid tries to stand, but falls over again. After a moment everyone realizes what's happened, and the tension breaks. 
ABE Alright. Joe. Joe climbs into the doorway. Kid Blue stands shakily. 
ABE (CONT'D) You didn't shoot your other foot off, didja kid? The door closes, and the gat men laugh at the Kid. 
INT. ABE'S OFFICE 
Cluttered, with a big desk. Joe sits, Abe hands him a handkerchief for the ugly gash on his cheek. 
ABE My great grandfather always told my grandfather, men's like spiders. It's the little ones you gotta be careful of. 
JOE Dunno I agree with that. 
ABE Oh yeah? Well. What the fuck did my great grandfather know. 
JOE (V.O.) This man is from the future. He was sent back here by the mob, a one way ticket, to run the Loopers. That's low effort even for Abe, so to pass the time he recruited some real muscle, the Gat Men. Now he runs the city. Any other city, that'd be impressive. Abe settles in his chair. Regards Joe. 
ABE How can you kids stand those chokers? This, the cravats. 
INT. SUZIE'S BEDROOM - LATER 
Suzie naked at the mirror. She goes to Joe, lying on the bed, distant. 
JOE I can't remember my mother's face. I remember her touching my hair. Like this. He takes Suzie's hand strokes it over his hair. She smiles briefly, tired, then takes her hand away and puts drops in his eyes. 
JOE (CONT'D) Do you want to go overseas? 
SUZIE Do I want to go overseas? With you? Now? 
JOE Soon, maybe. 
SUZIE Baby that's sweet. You're a sweet boy. You gotta be careful, it's easy to think you know someone once you been like this. What's in here is services rendered. 
JOE Is that how it aughta be? 
SUZIE What, in nature? 
(BEAT) You know I get this a lot. Especially young guys. I must have wife eyes or something. His face clouds. 
INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Joe gets home. Empty, quiet. Everything in place. He goes to the rug, pulls it aside. Opens the safe. All the gold, and nothing else. One bar juts from the side, knocked out of place. He pushes it back, and when he lifts his fingers they have a bright smear of fresh red blood. 
EXT. CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT 
A hunched figure sprints through an abandoned lot towards a train yard. It is a 55 YEAR OLD SETH. He limps up to a razor-wire fence bordering the train yard. Surveys the sharp wire, rips the lining from his jacket and wraps first his left hand then his right. But stops. On the palm of his right hand, a WEATHERED SCAR. Clearly carved in the shape of an arrow, pointing down to his wrist. Old Seth squints at it, confused. He pulls back his sleeve, revealing his clean bare forearm. Then his face changes. Because his arm is no longer bare. Suddenly, out of nowhere, more intricate scarring has appeared down its length. The scars spell out clearly: âBE AT 75 WIRE STREET IN 15 
MINUTESÂ Old Seth's breath returns, jagged. He pulls his sleeve up and hoists himself up the fence, climbing fast. He reaches the top, gets a good grasp on the wire to hoist himself over... and stops again. His right hand is missing a finger. The ring finger is just gone, its stump worn with age. Old Seth stares. And now his middle finger is gone as well. A freight train whistle moans. The cars, open and inviting, leading out of town. Behind him, the city. Terror and indecision seizes his chest, so much so that it takes a moment for him to realize the sound of his breathing has changed to a ragged whistle. 
He lifts his hand, now with just two fingers, to his face... and the smooth scarred hole where his nose used to be. 
EXT. CITY STREETS 
The train yard far in the distance. Old Seth RUNNING back into town. He looks down at his right hand, fingerless now but for his thumb. He speeds up, desperate. Cuts through an alley. And has no right hand, just a stump. 
OLD SETH No no no no no! A bell-like DING. Old Seth spins, sees a WEDDING BAND lying on the sidewalk. He picks it up with the four remaining fingers on his left hand, stuffs it in his pocket, sobbing. Bursts out of the alleyway, limping now, straight into the street and into the headlights of an oncoming car. The car screeches to a halt, and its harsh white light shows Old Seth's missing right ear, and deep scars down his face. 
IN THE CAR Old Seth throws open the drivers side door and throws out the DRIVER. Jams on the gas. Speeding through the streets, hands slipping on the wheel. His pant leg crumples. Empty boot tangling with the pedals. 
EXT. WIRE STREET 
The car hits a pole. Out climbs what's left of Old Seth, his face mangled, missing a foot, one arm gone to the elbow. Street sign - WIRE STREET. The numbers, 45. He runs. Howling, missing his tongue. Arm totally gone. Then falls as his leg goes to the knees. And he's crawling, an animal form, bellowing wordlessly. Makes it to an iron street-side door. 75. And with his one arm, slams it. Slumps against it, heaving. After a long moment it swings open. 
With no hesitation, a BLAST from the darkened doorway, and Old Seth's head mists open. He slumps to the pavement. Kid Blue steps from the doorway, drags the body inside. Deep in the dark doorway we glimpse a DOCTOR in a surgical frock smeared with bright red blood. The door SLAMS. 
INT. JOE'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Joe wakes with a start. 
EXT. CORN FIELD 
Joe's pocket watch at 2:29, ticking away. He takes his stance. Earbud headphones, the drone of French lessons. A hog-tied MAN with a sack on his head appears kneeling before Joe. Joe raises his gun without hesitation and shoots the man in the chest. Walks to the body, flips it. The man's hands, tied and purplish. Joe hesitates. Puts his hand next to them. Similar. He flips the man onto his back, stares long and hard at the shape of the man's face under the cloth sack. Tears it off. An older Asian man's face, frozen in terror. Joe smirks, the spell broken. His face hardens. 
INT. PLANT - DAY 
Joe watches the Asian man's body slide down the hatch and vanish in a puff of distant fire. 
BEGIN MONTAGE: 1. Joe in the club, drinking, watching more loopers celebrate. 2. Joe in the field, he shoots a hog-tied man. 3. Joe in his floor safe, setting more gold bars. 4. Joe in the field, BANG. 5. Joe in the club, watching Suzie with her red hair. 6. Joe in the field, BANG. 7. In the plant, a body sliding into the fire. 8. Joe in the field, BANG. BANG. BANG. His face more determined with each shot. 
EXT. CORN FIELD - DAY 
Our montage comes to an end suddenly and all is silent. Joe in the corn field, in his stance, ready to draw. But nothing happens. Silence. Joe checks his watch, confused. 2:30 and change. Waits. Watching the blank space where the man is supposed to appear. Hand on his gun. Breathing shallow. Something is wrong. 2:32. An eternity. Then, there he is. But different. Not kneeling. On his side, so he flops over and has to straighten himself. The man's hands are UNTIED. Holy shit. Joe raises his gun, scared. Time slows. Finger tightens on the trigger. Then he sees: the man has NO SACK ON HIS HEAD. And the face that stares back at Joe is his own. 57 YEAR OLD JOE. His eyes fixed on Joe. And for just one split second, Joe's face slackens, and his finger eases on the trigger. It's all the hesitation Old Joe needs. He throws his body into a spin. Joe snaps out of it, and PULLS THE TRIGGER. The shot catches Old Joe square in the back, and the impact blows him forward. But instead of blood beneath his torn jacket's back, we see the layered gold bars spill out. They caught the blast. In what seems like one fluid motion Old Joe's fingers grab one of the bars, he spins again, throwing handfuls of dirt and the bar back towards Joe. Joe flinches, again just for a moment, and when his eyes focus again and his arm steadies the gun it's too late. Old Joe is on top of him, with a heavy blow knocking the gun aside, and with an even heavier one swinging down on Joe's head, a fist and then 
THE CORN FIELD, HOURS LATER Joe wakes. Blood caked on his face. Headphones beside him, still squawking French lessons. Sits up. 
JOE Oh god. Gold bars scattered in the dirt. But no Old Joe. And no truck. Joe staggers to his feet, shaky. Head thick. But realizing. 
Loud and dark. Joe shotguns eye drops right out in the open, dances like a madman. 
INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY 
Joe's apartment, unpacked and lived in. Joe smokes. In a NOOK behind a wall panel - stacks of CASH. 
EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY 
Cloudy and cold. Joe wanders alone. Buffeted by strangers. 
EXT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT 
Music pumping, Joe deadened at a table, in another world. Beside him a YOUNG PUNK makes a glass float using his TK power, then shatters the glass. Red liquid goes everywhere. 
INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY 
Joe takes money from the stacks in the nook, which have grown drastically low. LATER - sets a hypo down in the ashtray. 
INT. PARIS BODEGA - DAY 
A GUN in the face of the shop's OWNER. Held by Joe. Several years older now, in his mid thirties. Dressed in a suit, surrounded by fellow GANGSTERS. Now part of their gang. 
EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT 
A shoot-out between rival gangs. Joe's guns blaze. A remorseless killer. Blasting away, cold and skillful. Smashing up shops that won't pay protection. He's muscle. 
INT. PARIS GANG HEADQUARTERS 
A dingy dark hallway. Distant thumping bass indicates it's maybe behind a club. The hall is lined with French Gangster, all similarly dressed. Reminiscent of the Gat Men. It takes us a moment to recognize Joe among them. In his EARLY 40s now. His face a hard weathered mask. A soldier. (Note - it is here we transition from the actor playing Young Joe to the one playing Old Joe.) 
EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY 
Snow on the ground. 
INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT 
Old Joe high as a kite, in an all out brawl. Punched to the ground. Laughing his ass off. A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around. Old Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his WIFE for the first time. Long red hair (reminiscent of but NOT Suzie.) In a green dress. She flees the fighting, towards the exit. 
âSORTIE.â Transfixed and high, Old Joe follows her. Puts his hand on her shoulder. She turns, looks him over. Flips him off. Leaves. Old Joe watches her go. In love. 
INT. PARIS CAFE - DAY 
Old Joe hits on his future Wife, she tells him to fuck off. 
INT. PARIS BEDROOM - DAY 
Old Joe in bed with his future Wife. They kiss. 
EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY 
Old Joe shoots up a storefront with his gang. 
INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY 
Old Joe's future wife yells at him, holding his gun holsters accusingly. She throws them across the room. LATER - He holds her in bed, both of them troubled. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Old Joe driving. Deep in thought. His future Wife beside him, her hand on his. He hits the brakes. 
EXT. FRENCH BEACH / HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS 
The car screeches to a halt on a beach side road. Old Joe gets out, runs across the beach to the water, pulling his gun out of its holster. He fires it out to sea till its empty, then throws the gun into the ocean. He runs back to his Wife, standing on the beach. They kiss. They fall to the sand, and kiss. 
EXT. FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 
A cottage in the country. 
Joe wakes slowly, pained. Lying alone in an abandoned lot on the outskirts of town. Slowly he takes stock of himself. Nothing broken. A tight bandage on his ear. A mournful train whistle, and he turns. Through a chain link fence, the train yard. He was put here for a reason. A man and a young boy in rags hop onto an empty cargo car, heading out of town. Joe watches the boy, his eyes angry. Stands shakily. And walks away from the train yard. Something like a HELICOPTER sweeps overhead, a spotlight zigzagging the area. Joe ducks into shadows, heading towards the city. 
INT. LA BELLE AURORE BACKSTAGE 
A swarm of activity, Gat Men rushing in and out. 
ABE (PRE-LAP) He ain't dumb like the last, we gotta get lucky now. Cover the roads out of town. Sweep the streets, pull in his social circle, pound the pavement. 
INT. ABE'S DEN 
Map spread on a table. Gat men gathered around Abe. 
GAT MAN 3 He'll hop a train. Fast and untraceable. 
ABE Maybe. Sweep the train yard. Every second that passes is bad, go. 
INT. ABE'S OFFICE 
Kid Blue slumps in a chair, holding a rag to a wound on his head. Eyes wet from crying. Abe storms in. 
ABE Stupid little shit. 
KID BLUE I can't hear you Abe leans in next to his ear and shouts 
ABE Well that's what happens when you fire a gat in a steel box you stupid little shit. 
KID BLUE I can fix this. I can find him. 
ABE Go home and let the grown ups work. Kid Blue. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
More helicopters sweep the streets, searchlights blazing. Cars with Gat Men circle slowly, shining spotlights themselves. Joe leaps from the shadows, ducks behind a dumpster. Barely avoiding the light. He won't last long out here. 
JOE Where would I go if I were me. 
He sprints into an alleyway, but Gat Men are coming down the other side with flashlights. Goes back the way he came, turns a corner. 
EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT 
Joe finds himself in front of a familiar BRIGHT RED GARAGE. Seth's apartment. Three stories up, Seth's darkened window. He looks up at it, hesitant but desperate. 
INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT 
A window shatters inward, punched through by a wrapped fist. A big reading hall, empty and dark. The broken window opens, Old Joe slides in. Weaves his way past the reading tables, finds what he's looking for at a desk. A suspended sheet of thin plastic turns out to be a computer. Checking his hand, he inputs the number. Navigates menus and windows, information flashing, searching. 
EXT. LA BELLE AURORE - NIGHT 
Gat Men in cars and helicopters patrol the streets. Kid Blue sits on the curb, smoking a cigarette. Seething at his bandaged hand. Deep in thought. His eyes lift. An idea. 
EXT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The familiar red garage. And three stories up, Seth's lit window. Kid Blue pulls a small caliber gun from a holster concealed on his boot, enters the building. 
INT. PUBLIC LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Old Joe finishes printing several large documents that look like maps. He folds them up, pockets them. Dashes to the window, starts to heft himself up - And stops. On his hand, a smooth aged scar. Of an arrow. Pointing to his wrist. Old Joe's breath catches. He pulls down his sleeve, revealing âBâ then âEâ Then âA then âTâ... He bares his arm, reading the entire message. 
INT. SETH'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The peephole screen on the inside of Seth's apartment door. Kid Blue manipulating a device, a shower of sparks blows the screen out momentarily, and the door swings open. Kid Blue storms in, his gun drawn, sweeping through the apartment with over-eager purpose. Empty. He deflates. Thinks. Goes to the peephole screen, touches it and a menu comes up. A little manipulating, and the image is rewinding. An empty hall, scanning back half an hour. Then: young Joe. Kid Blue stops scanning, hits âPLAY'. Joe feels around the door jam, retrieves a key, and enters the apartment. Kid Blue exhales. Well Joe was here. Taps the screen again, it goes back to a live feed, and he's about to step away when his eye catches something. He pushes a square on the screen, and the view changes. To a live feed from a camera in the ceiling of the apartment. Excited, Kid rewinds this half an hour. On the screen: Joe enters the apartment. Rifles around a little, then sits at the table. Head in his hands. Staring into space. Then goes to a kitchen drawer, opens it, gets something. Goes to the front door, takes something off the wall, briskly exits. Kid Blue stops the screen. He goes and sits where Joe sat. Stares where Joe stared. The kitchen counter. A blender, sink. Can labeled âCOFFEE.â Kid goes to the kitchen drawer Joe opened, pulls it open. It's full of knives. Kid goes finally to the door, looks at the wall. A small rack for keys, several hanging and one empty hook. Kid Blue stares into space, trying to put these pieces together. Lights a cigarette. 
EXT. CORN FIELD - DAWN - ESTABLISHING 
The sun rises over a flat endless field of corn stalks. 
EXT. CORN FIELD 
OLD JOE (CONT'D) No? Well you'll get there eventually. Obviously. 
JOE I don't care what you're here for, whatever you think you're going to get from me. More time or whatever you want. I can't let you walk away from this diner alive. Because the next 30 years of my 
LIFE- 
OLD JOE JOE I'm sorry to cut off - sorry -are mine they're not yours to cut off this spiel you've they're not yours anymore you been practicing all night, can say anything you want but but I need you to need you to you're not walking outta here listen. Listen. alive 
OLD JOE You know what the voice of god sounds like? See now good you're confused now but you're listening. I hope the voice of god sounds like an old man speaking French. Old men speaking French sound like primeval trees in a strong wind, just irrefutable. Wise, strong, gentle, all these things in harmony, complimentary. At once. Old men speaking French. Young men speaking French sound, without exception, like weenies. Fact. You ever hear a Frenchman under 40 try to sound threatening? It's hilarious. English is a tight t- shirt, flatters the young. Rat a tat tat. French is a double breasted suit. Young man can put it on, but it always feels like he's putting something on. Some things, you just need the years. It's my favorite language. 
JOE I've got a life ahead of me that's mine and I'm not giving it up for you or anybody 
OLD JOE Well you know what you have to do then why don't you take your little gun out from between your knees and do it. One in the head, two in the heart. Boy. It's all âanybodyâ and âneverâ and then you show up here and think you can talk me into dying. Well bullshit we both know you're not going to kill me. Christ you ordered eggs. Old Joe downs two aspirin. Takes a breath. 
OLD JOE (CONT'D) I know why you couldn't pull that trigger. When you're tasked to do the unthinkable, your mind, it'll do anything it can to stop you. Only way is you gotta know why you're doing it, in your bones, so you can say it out loud to someone without apologizing. Or you gotta cut yourself off, go numb. But that'll kill you, down the line. 
(BEAT) It's hard to make eye contact with you. It's too strange. 
JOE Your face looks backwards. 
OLD JOE Yeah, that helps actually. That little twist of unfamiliar. 
(BEAT) You're not winning some pissing contest by looking me in the eye, you didn't know what I looked like until yesterday, it makes sense that it's easier for you. 
JOE I wasn't trying to. Do you know what's going to happen? Have you already done all this, right now, as me? 
OLD JOE No not - exactly - I don't want to talk about time travel shit, because we'll start talking about it and then we'll be here all day making diagrams with straws. It doesn't matter. 
JOE When I hurt myself now, it changes your body. Do my actions change your memories? 
OLD JOE It doesn't matter because I don't know how it works. Nobody knows how it works. Time travel was an accident, thirty years from now the smartest men in the world know exactly one thing about it that you don't: they know to be scared to death of it. 
(BEAT) My memory is cloudy, there's a cloud. It's a, it starts clear then gets cloudy as it goes back.. Goddammit hand me those. Straws. Joe passes him two. 
OLD JOE (CONT'D) And the salt. No, the pepper. The pepper. Old Joe sets two straws about a foot apart, parallel, and pours pepper between them, thus: 
OLD JOE (CONT'D) Ok, the span between the straws is a timeline of the next 30 years. 
THIS (the left straw) is the present moment, right now. 
AND THIS (the right straw) is the moment thirty years from now when I was sent back. The machine is tuned to a fixed time, you know that, 30 some years, it's not adjustable. 
JOE What's the pepper? 
OLD JOE The pepper is a sort of fog. See my memories start clear here, (at the right straw) but as they go back they get cloudier, until they're totally obscured. It's like a fog. Because my memories aren't really memories, they're one possible eventuality now, and they grow clearer or cloudier as they become more or less likely. But then they get to the present moment (the left straw) And they're instantly clear again. Like a wall of fog moving forward with the present moment. I can remember what you do after you do it. He pushes the left straw slowly towards the right, and it pushes the pepper with it. 
JOE So you can 
OLD JOE And it hurts. 
JOE So when we're apart you can remember what I do. After I do it. 
OLD JOE Uh huh. But Beatrix brings their food, two identical plates. Old Joe awkwardly clears away the pepper and straws. 
OLD JOE (CONT'D) This is a precise description of a fuzzy mechanism. Time travel fucks everything, my brain and body try to catch up. It's messy. That's why it's dangerous. And it hurts. All I know I know two things for sure. I know what's happening in my head. And I know that you're still going to meet her. 
JOE Who? Old Joe takes a worn double of Joe's POCKET WATCH from his pocket, clicks it open. We don't see inside it, but he stares at it intently. 
JOE (CONT'D) This is a woman, what? I'm going to fall in love with? 
OLD JOE She's gonna save your life. Old Joe makes eye contact with Joe, for maybe the first time, and holds it. Unexpectedly naked on his face is the deepest sort of grief. Deep and unrelenting. Joe can't look at it, he breaks off his gaze. The grief is too much for Old Joe to swallow back down, so he turns it into anger. 
OLD JOE (CONT'D) For a long time at the beginning she thought we'd have a baby. She would have been a good mother. She wanted that so much. And now I'm saying sorry to a picture. 
JOE She's. How is she, you said save my life. 
OLD JOE Your life. Let's look. At your life. You're a killer and a junkie. And a fucking child mentality, âMy life,â âwhat's mine.â Save your life, you're asking how? The question is why. Why would someone waste themselves on you, give up the good life they had, sacrifice a good life to love you. 
OLD JOE It's been thirty years for me, so it's hard to remember. When you stole Seth's bike you stripped out the security tracker. Right? Joe's fearful face says âno.' Old Joe draws his gat. 
OLD JOE (CONT'D) Make it to the field, you can lose them in the field. Go east and hop 
A TRAIN Joe punches Old Joe square in the jaw, and he goes down. His papers and gun fall. The diner door EXPLODES. 
JOE I've got him! He's here! A GAT MAN barrels in, his gat blazing. Joe scrambles but Old Joe gets the gat. With an expert shot Old Joe puts the Gat Man down, but there are two more behind him. Pinned behind a booth, Old Joe returns fire, glass breaking and chaos. Joe grabs at the papers, Old Joe grabs them first and yanks. Leaving Joe with a torn-off top sheet. Joe scrambles away, down the length of the diner behind the booths, back to their table, as the Gat Men and Old Joe have their fire fight. Joe's blunderbuss on the ground beneath the table. He scoops it up. Turns, and fires at Old Joe. 
OLD JOE Shit. Joe's blunderbuss hacks another shot, and the window behind Old Joe explodes. Old Joe makes his break, sprints for the broken window, jumps... 
EXT. BACK OF DINER - MORNING 
...and hits the dusty parking lot running. Towards the corn. 
EXT. FRONT OF DINER 
Kid Blue squats on his haunches with four more Gat Men, their guns trained on the diner door. Three Gat Men burst out, followed by Joe. 
DINER GAT MAN The back, he's running! 
JOE Around back! 
They all run around back, where Old Joe is halfway to the corn but not there yet. The seven Gat Men and Kid Blue and Joe fire their guns after him while running but they're too far away (and they're running) so nothing hits. Joe blasts at the old man blindly, sprinting with all his might, eyes streaming tears in the dust. When Old Joe hits the wall of corn he seems to vanish. Four of the Gat Men follow him in, while the remaining pursuers slow to a stop, doubled over, panting. Defeated. It takes a few seconds for Kid Blue to realize that Joe is there with them. It takes another second for Joe to realize that the dynamic has changed. He turns and runs back towards the diner, Kid Blue and the Gat men in pursuit. One of the Gat Men fires. 
KID BLUE Alive! No, alive! Joe makes it to the Slat Bike, jumps on, hits the ignition. 
CLICK. 
JOE No fuck no fucking piece of shit CLICK CLICK. The Kid and the Gats closing in, and just the moment that Kid Blue lays his hands on the back of the bike the engine turns over with a ROAR. The back of the bike kicks up, heat and air blasts from the open slats beneath, blowing Kid Blue back on his ass. The bike HOVERS a few feet off the ground. Joe roars off into the corn. The Kid is on his feet running back to the Gat Men. 
KID BLUE The tracker! Get the tracker! 
EXT. CORN FIELD 
Joe riding at full speed through the thick corn stalks. He BAILS, snapping through corn stalks and rolling to a painful stop. The bike ZOOMS onward through the stalks, quickly out of sight. Pained, Joe lies still, breathing hard. Pulls Old Joe's torn paper from his pocket. On one side, the number Old Joe scribbled: 1027363259 He flips it over. It's a map. Mostly of empty farm land, bisected by a bold highway and scattered farm houses. One of them is CIRCLED IN BLACK. 
SARA 
EXT. FIELD - DAWN 
A bare field of churned chocolatey earth. Near its edge juts the dead stump of an old tree. A YOUNG WOMAN in work clothes named SARA chops away at the trunk with a large axe. Over and over, splintering it apart. Endless plains of corn surround the field. In the near distance, a two story farm house with an adjacent barn. Sara focused on her work as the sun rises. 
EXT. CORN FIELD - EARLY MORNING 
Sara fiddles with a garbage can sized DEVICE, and with a crackle of mechanic thrusters it floats up and over the corn fields, spraying something chemical. 
INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING 
Sara makes coffee. 
EXT. FARM HOUSE PORCH - EARLY MORNING 
She sits on a rocking chair, and mimes smoking an invisible cigarette. Our first good look at her face. Clear and beautiful, but it has been here for awhile. The morning light changes from steel blue to pale white. Rocking gently, fake smoking and drinking coffee. Not going anywhere. 
INT. FARM HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING 
Blinds drawn, dark. A FIGURE lies in bed. Sara steps in, puts her hand on the sleeping figure's foot. 
SARA C'mon baby. Time to get up. 
INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING 
Cooking eggs. The front door bangs. She looks up. 
INT. FARM HOUSE FOYER 
The screen door bangs in the wind. Sara inspects it. The latch is broken. She sighs. Then freezes. 
Joe slumped over unconscious where we left him, in the corn. Sara's shout wakes him with a start. Sweating, pasty. Disoriented. Something is wrong with him. In a flash of panic he parts the corn stalks, sees Sarah backing away from the barn. The dark hulking figure of a man pursues her slowly but steadily. 
JOE 
SHIT His hand goes to his holster but his gun has fallen out, he scrambles in the dirt for it. 
EXT. FRONT LAWN 
Sara backing up still, shotgun leveled. The man, still in darkness, comes towards her. 
SARA You stop right there, you stop! She fires her gun in the air. The man pauses, but then continues towards her. She trips on a root, FALLS. 
INT. 2ND STORY BEDROOM - NIGHT 
From a CHILD'S POV - We run across a darkened bedroom to the WINDOW. A child's hand smacks the glass, and framed through the pane, through the unseen child's eyes, this is what we 
SEE: Sara on the ground, fumbling the gun. In trouble. The DARK MAN, advancing towards her menacingly. At the last moment, from the corn fields, JOE runs into the light and steps directly between them, shouts, his gun raised at the Dark Man. And the Dark Man STOPS. 
EXT. FRONT LAWN - CONTINUOUS 
Joe's gun leveled, face set. But the porch light on the man's face: it is not Old Joe. It is a man in his 30s, filthy, with down's syndrome. A greasy sign around his neck: âPLEASE HELP MUWTE FOOD $ GOD 
BLESS YOUÂ Joe lowers his gun, face melting. 
SARA Jee sus. (to the MUTE VAGRANT) Hey, hey. I'm going to get you 
SOME FOOD- But the man scampers off, leaving his sign. 
SARA (CONT'D) ...great. 
EXT. SECOND STORY BEDROOM WINDOW 
The child, in darkness, watching. He recedes into the bedroom, his hand slipping off the glass. 
EXT. FRONT LAWN 
Sara stands, picks up the sign, calls after the MUTE. 
SARA Hey you forgot your greasy goddamn hobo sign oh for godssakes. (turns to Joe) Alright, what are you? Joe turns away from her quickly, but doubles over, crumpling to a heap on the grass. Sara checks his face. 
SARA (CONT'D) Hey. Look at - hey. The fuck- ehh. Joe PUKES. She steps away. Takes a moment. Breathes. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - MOMENTS LATER 
She drags Joe up onto the porch, under the light. 
SARA Hey. Up here, at the light. Hey. Sara SLAPS HIM. Hard. His eyes snap open. He sees her face. She feels his head. Checks his eyes. Cherry red and veined, swollen under the lids. 
JOE 
(TOTALLY GONE) My head... splitting apart... time eventualities, he said- 
SARA How long since you dropped? 
JOE 
DROPPED Sara mimes an eye dropper. 
SARA Dropped, or what the kids call it. 
JOE A day. 
SARA One day. Wow. She leans back on her haunches, looks at him, deep in thought. Deciding what to do. Joe lies prone, shaking, sweating. 
JOE Thirsty. I can't feel my legs 
SARA You're withdrawing from a synthetic barbiturate. It's a quick punch but it's this bad a day in, without care you might not make it through the night. Sara looks at his shoes. Beneath the caked mud, fine leather. Her eyes linger on his gun. They turn cold. 
INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL 
Underground. We move through it. 
INT. RUNOFF ROOM 
Cavernous space beneath a high street grating, damp and cold. Old Joe sits on the ground, methodically cleaning and loading his gun. He finishes. Places the gun on top of his folded, torn maps. Closes his eyes. Sees: 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY) 
A bank of fog clears, revealing Sara's face looking down at us. She slaps us hard. 
SARA Hey. 
INT. RUNOFF ROOM 
Old Joe touches his temple. Head aching. Remembering. 
OLD JOE The first time I saw her face. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY) 
Sara's face. SLAP! 
SARA Hey. 
INT. RUNOFF ROOM 
OLD JOE No. No no. His POCKET WATCH sits open in front of him. He picks it up. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT (OLD JOE MEMORY) 
Sara's face. SLAP! 
INT. RUNOFF ROOM 
Old Joe holds his pocket watch tight like a talisman. Fingers dug deep in his head. 
OLD JOE No. The first time I saw her face. 
INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT 
A fist comes straight at us. SMACK! We reel back, revealing: the Paris club, crowded and rowdy. A piece of Old Joe's life that we've seen before. Joe (mid 40s) lies on the ground, lip bloodied, laughing hysterically at a YOUNG PUNK who has just hit him. A bar fight blossoms in slow motion all around. Joe looks up, sees the woman who will be his Wife for the first time. In her green dress. Whisps of fog drift into frame. 
INT. RUNOFF ROOM 
Inside Old Joe's pocket watch, a picture. Of his WIFE. The sun breaks in through the grate above. Old Joe closes the pocket watch, holds in tight. Then he stands and picks up the gun and goes. 
CUT TO: A child stands in a massive doorway with blinding white light beaming through. JOE'S FACE - wrecked, but his eyes flutter. Blink. 
INT. BARN - MORNING 
Joe lies on the cot. Blinks. The barn doors, the morning sun rising through. If the child was there, he's gone now. 
INT. FARMHOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING 
Cid draws at the kitchen table. Sara enters. 
SARA Morning monkey. 
CID The man's up. Sara stiffens, looks out the window. 
CID (CONT'D) Is he staying here now? 
SARA No. 
A WALL OF LEAVES Fingers part the green, and Old Joe peers through the dense foliage. 
HEY- And without hesitating Sara hefts the shotgun and SHOOTS HIM. BLAST! Rips his shirt open bloody, blows him back screaming. 
EXT. PARK 
Old Joe STOPS in his tracks, children running around him. His hand goes to his temple. 
EXT. BARN - DAY (OLD JOE MEMORY) 
Fog clears from Sara blasting us with her shotgun. 
EXT. PARK 
Old Joe's hand runs from his temple to his neck. Feels a new but old scar, just a little divot behind his ear. 
INT. BARN 
Sara drags Joe in by the foot. She heaves the barn door closed. In the lamp lit dark Joe rolls and groans in the dirt. 
SARA Who are you? She shoves the shotgun barrel in his face, a rush of fury 
SARA (CONT'D) You're right I'm not a killer but I am fine with how a blast of rock salt to your face won't kill you. Who are you and what are you here for? Who are you? Joe breathes hard, bleeding in the dirt with a shotgun in his nose. But he forces calm. A beat. Then he starts talking. 
JOE Time travel hasn't been invented yet. But in thirty years it will be. 
EXT. PARK - DAY 
A suburban park. On its far end, a birthday party. The YOUNG BOY in the bright jacket we saw run out of the house earlier sits alone under a tree. Old Joe approaches him. 
OLD JOE Hi. Daniel, right? I'm Chad's father. Aren't you going to come over? We're doing cake. 
DANIEL It's ice cream cake and I can't eat ice cream. Cause of the milk. 
OLD JOE Well you should join the party even if you don't have cake. You have a birthday coming up? 
DANIEL In July. We were gonna go to the lake but I don't think we are now. 
OLD JOE I'm sorry. Old Joe leaves, walks across the grass. Having trouble breathing. 
INT. BARN 
Sara sits. Joe weakly talks, the end of a long explanation. 
JOE I can't go back to the city and find him cause Abe, the boss, all his men are going to search the streets 24/7 till they turn up me or... him. All I have is this map. And that he's coming here. Sara stands. Paces away. Deep in thought. 
SARA A Looper. 
JOE Yeah. Did you know about Loopers, what we do 
SARA I've heard stories. So he's coming here to murder me and my son because he thinks we might be this Rainmaker. And once he kills the Rainmaker, what happens? 
JOE I think... he thinks, the instant the rainmaker dies, he'll never have been sent back, so he'll just vanish, and be back with his wife. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET 
The same track home Old Joe studied from the trees earlier. Daniel trots towards it, coming home from the birthday party. 
INT. BARN 
SARA Who is he? The guy you let run? Just some random guy from the future? 
JOE Yeah. Someone. You know what these numbers mean. 
EXT. SUBURBAN HOME BACK YARD - DAY 
Well tended by someone who loves growing things. Laurels, ivy on trellises, flowers and trees. Daniel comes through the side gate. Lifts the back door matt, revealing a dusty key. 
INT. BARN 
JOE If I'm out here and you're in the house we're gonna need some way to communicate. 
SARA There's a dinner bell down by the barn, ring that if someone's coming, I'll hear it. 
JOE Dinner bell. We need walkies, or buzzers. 
SARA Dunno what we've got but I'll look. She spots Cid at the screen door, watching them. 
SARA (CONT'D) Cid. She goes to take him inside. 
JOE Got any ammo for that shotgun? That isn't a seasoning? 
INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
Sara leads Cid back into the house. 
SARA How's the maths coming? 
CID I wanna help the man. 
SARA Help him what? 
CID I could help him with my toys. 
SARA Baby. Listen. I need you to stay away from that man. Okay? Let him- 
HEY Cid squirms out of her grasp, bats her away with a light but angry slap. She grabs his arm harder. 
SARA (CONT'D) Let him do his thing, but you stay with me. 
CID Is he not good? 
SARA Well we're gonna see what he is. But you stick with me. Yeah? 
INT. DRAINAGE TUNNEL - EVENING 
Old Joe's little hide-out. He violently washes his hands in a trench of water. Slumps back, eyes blood red. Streaks of tears down his face. Reddish light fading to blue through the grating high above. Runs fingers across his forehead, spreading cooling water. His eyes close. His breathing shallows. In one hand he holds his pocket watch. He places the other on the gat. The map beneath it. Daniel's map location CROSSED OUT. Two others remaining. And the missing corner, edge torn. CLOSE ON Old Joe's face. Slipping to sleep. Then from nowhere a CHILD'S HAND enters frame and rests on his forehead. Old Joe's eyes gasp open with terror 
EXT. PORCH - NIGHT 
but it's Joe who wakes up with a start. Slumped against the steps, gun in hand. Cid's hand on his forehead. Cid steps back quickly, puts his finger to his lips. Shhh. 
INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER - NIGHT 
Cid leads Joe inside, beckoning him to follow. 
INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN 
Dark. Cid leads Joe to the kitchen table. Laid out on it: an arrangement of toys. With the deliberateness of a man at work Cid clicks on a flashlight and sets it on the table. Works on several toys, cracking open cases, pulling out wires. Hands moving fast. Joe sits, watching Cid. 
CID Hand me that Phillips. Joe hands him the screwdriver. Cid keeps working. 
CID (CONT'D) Tell me if you hear her coming. 
JOE What are we doing here? 
CID Commundication. He pushes a button on a small plastic box in his hands, and an identical one next to Joe lights up. The way Joe looks at Cid changes slightly. 
CID (CONT'D) But I need to make it stronger. 
JOE How do you do that? 
CID Bigger battery. Joe idly fingers a toy. 
JOE Smart. 
CID Do you kill people? Joe half laughs. Cid keeps working, his face in shadows. 
SARA What? 
JOE You said you were his mom. 
SARA Uh huh. 
JOE He told me you're not. This hits Sara hard. She resumes chopping to cover it. 
SARA He said that? 
JOE If he's not your son who is he? 
SARA 
(SHARP) He's my son. 
(BEAT) I had Cid when I was twenty two. But I didn't want to give up my life. In the city. The word âcityâ has weight for her. Implies volumes. 
SARA (CONT'D) So I dropped Cid with my mom, here. And my sister. And they saw how I was living and they took him. My sister raised him here, she loved him. He called her mom. 
JOE How'd she get killed? When Sara's eyes hit him they're daggers. 
JOE (CONT'D) Cid told me. You have to talk to him about it. Icy silence from Sara, and an odd stare. 
SARA I told you one thing, I told you to stay away from my son. 
JOE He asked about my gun. You think this is going to go away if you don't talk to him about it but it's just gonna grow 
SARA Stay out of it. Stay the fuck away from my son. 
She goes back to chopping. Joe lingers, then leaves. She hacks away. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - EARLY MORNING 
Sara sits with coffee, looking out at the fields. Deep in thought. She takes a drag from her pretend cigarette. 
EXT. CHEAP APARTMENT BUILDING - EARLY MORNING 
A motel style building. Gat Men in cars pass occasionally with spotlights and radios, but the activity has calmed. Old Joe slips around a corner. Staying hid. Checks the address on the map. 12 Talbott Dr, #205. Makes a break for stairs leading to the 2nd level. But just at that moment a car pulls into the building's lot. Old Joe ducks under the stairs. Holding his breath. The car parks. Door slams. Footsteps. A WOMAN. Slumping exhausted, up the stairs. And through the slatted steps Old Joe sees her face flash by. It is Suzie, the girl from Abe's brothel. Old Joe's face, pure disbelief. He recognizes her instantly. It can't be. He gingerly steps half a foot out. Looking up he can see the apartment doors above. Suzie walks down the landing. Towards apartment 205. Jesus it can't be. Then she passes it. Keeps walking. Old Joe's eyes, relieved. She stops at the next door over, knocks. It opens, vaguely indistinct conversation between her and the girl that answers. 
SUZIE Sorry, I know I promised five, you know how it gets. 
GIRL NEIGHBOR Don't worry sugar. She was no problem. Gat men searched through here, lookin for god knows... Suzie disappears into the apartment. Re-emerges, holding a sleeping 6 year old girl. She whispers goodbye to the neighbor and walks back to APARTMENT 205. She enters. 
Old Joe, frozen. Gun in his hand. Face numbly: âYou have to be shitting me.â He climbs the stairs. On the 2nd story landing. To 205. Breath held, back against the wall. Peeks in the window. On the couch, Suzie holding her daughter. Head in her lap. Stroking her hair. Suzie's back is to us, and with her long red hair down, she is eerily reminiscent of Old Joe's wife. Old Joe watches them for a long time. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT PORCH - DAY 
Joe sits, watching the corn. It rustles in the wind. Hand on his blunderbuss. Beside it, his frog buzzer. The tension is constant. And it's a long, long day. 
INT. FARMHOUSE HALLWAY - LATER 
Sara vacuums while Cid plays with toy trucks. 
INT. FARMHOUSE LAUNDRY ROOM - LATER 
In the basement, bare concrete. Sara empties the dryer. 
INT. CID'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Sara sits on the floor with Cid, putting numbered tiles on a plastic multiplication table. 
SARA Where does 56 go? Good. 21. 
CID How long can you not sleep? 
SARA I don't know, awhile. That's a good question. Where's it go. Good, there. 32. 
Cid stands, balls his fists, SCREAMING at her. Sara pushes back away from him. Maybe a cloud passed over the sun. The room darkens. And we see it now, in her eyes: Sara is afraid. She bolts out of the room. 
EXT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY 
Sara walks fast down the hall 
INT. SARA'S BEDROOM 
Not slowing, through her bedroom 
INT. SARA'S CLOSET 
Into her walk-in closet, to a huge steel safe tucked in back. She opens the safe with trembling hands. And climbs inside. 
INT. SAFE 
Closes the heavy door. Turns on a small LED light. And waits. Cid's screams distant but not lessening. 
EXT. BARN - CONTINUOUS 
Cid's screams from the house, clear as day. Joe paces in front of the barn. Turns his head back towards the house, not sure what to think. The screams stop. Joe turns uneasily back to the swaying corn. 
INT. CID'S BEDROOM 
The math game scattered, numbered tiles everywhere. Cid lies face down on the bed, cried out. Sara enters quietly. Sits on the bed beside him. Strokes his hair. He folds into her, and they're holding each other tight. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY 
A Gat Man named CANADY strolls out of a donut shop, coffee in hand, and gets in his car. 
INT. CANADY'S CAR 
Canady starts the car up, starts driving. 
Somehow not seeing Kid Blue crouched clear as day in the passenger side foot-well. 
KID BLUE Hey Can. Can. Canady sees him, jumps and yelps. The sedan swerves, scrapes to a stop against a parked car. Coffee everywhere. 
CANADY Jesus, fuckin Kid Blue what the 
FUCK 
KID BLUE Pull into that alley. 
CANADY You get the fuck outta 
KID BLUE You don't wanna be seen with me Canady, pull in the alley. Canady glares at him, but pulls the car into a narrow alley, parks it. 
CANADY The fuck are you still doing in town, Abe wants you dead man 
KID BLUE All Abe wants right now is the looper. Unless he got him last night? 
CANADY Jssshhh. No we didn't get him. Spotted and lost him. West End, near Whore's Alley. 
KID BLUE Whore's Alley? 
CANADY That area, Mott & Talbott, little working girl colony. 
KID BLUE (has a thought) Whore's Alley.. 
CANADY You shoulda left town man. 
KID BLUE I'm gonna bring him in, get right with Abe. 
CANADY Yeah, maybe you bring him the looper, but short of that Abe don't get right with priced men. 
KID BLUE I got a price? 
The car screeches to a stop, and Old Joe runs to the sea. THROWS his gun in the ocean. Above the waters, the sun breaks the clouds. Rain falls. He runs back to her. Falls on her. Kissing her. He holds her face like the most precious thing in the world. 
OLD JOE Anything. 
INT. CHURCH - EVENING 
Rain beats against stained glass. Old Joe kneeling in a pew. Fists clenched as if in prayer. He stands, stumbles out. 
EXT. LA BELLE AURORE SIDE ENTRANCE - EVENING 
Oddly quiet. Old Joe walks down the sidewalk towards the side entrance to the theater. Face uncovered. In plain sight. Not caring. Stops 30 feet shy of the entrance, at a street garbage can. He draws his gun and leans over to drop it into the can. He lets it dangle from his fingers above the trash can. His pocket watch, hanging open from its chain. The picture of his Wife inside. Spinning. His gun slowly slipping from his grasp. 
With each spin of the watch, the photo of his Wife appears cloudier. Blurred. Indistinct. Gun on the tips of his fingers, about to fall. Then the photo is nearly gone. 
OLD JOE'S EYES. 
INT. PARIS CLUB - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Old Joe staggering to his feet from a fight. We've seen this before, it's the IDENTICAL SCENE to the previous flashback. But when he sees his Wife for the first time, whisps of FOG grow, blotting out the scene. Deep in the fog are other backgrounds - a street, a house - and unfamiliar faces. Other eventualities, clouding this one as it becomes less likely Old Joe will meet his wife and have this memory. Erasing it. 
OLD JOE'S EYES. 
INT. PARIS APARTMENT - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
Old Joe in bed with his wife. Baby crying outside. Her face. Then, whisps of FOG thickens, obscuring them. 
OLD JOE'S EYES. 
EXT. FRENCH BEACH - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
The thrown gun splashes in the sea, and Old Joe turns back to the beach. But where his Wife was in the previous memory, now there is the FOG. A wall of it, massive, reaching to the sky. Old Joe dwarfed against it. Caught between the roiling waves and this wall of nothingness falling towards him. 
OLD JOE'S EYES. The gun on his fingertips. About to fall. A moment of decision. 
INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Sara lies in bed. Eyes wide open. Still and quiet in the dark. Her hand moves over her bare leg. Slides across the sheets. Finds the Frog Buzzer lying next to her. A moment of hesitation. Then she pushes it. Silence. Her eyes go to the window. A long beat. Then sound: a door opening in the house below. 
Quick footsteps approaching. Her eyes follow them. The door flies open. Joe, gun in hand, buzzer in the other. His eyes adjust to the dark. 
JOE What? Closes the door, kisses him. The adrenaline in his head doesn't know where to go. 
SARA Don't wake Cid. She pulls him to the bed, lifting his shirt off. The rain starts to fall against the windows. 
LATER Lying beside each other. Joe still stunned. Sara smokes a real cigarette, taking a deep joyful drag. She sets the lighter on her palm. It floats about a foot in the air, spinning, then drops. 
JOE That's pretty good. 
SARA In the city, young guys would hit on me by floating fucking quarters, I wouldn't tell âem I was TK but I'd keep their quarters down. One guy busted a blood vessel in his eye trying to get it up. 
(BEAT) He's you. Your loop. You lied to me. She doesn't seem angry but deeply curious. Joe sits up. 
SARA (CONT'D) But you protected Cid. And I know you're not lying that you're gonna kill this guy, your own self. Even though he's protecting your future. 
JOE He's protecting his future. Not mine. A beat. 
SARA When I came back, after my sister died. Cid was sitting on the porch, I remember seeing him for the first time, in two years. 
(MORE) 
SARA (CONT'D) Saw him on the porch. I drove up crying and I had been at a party in the city when I got the call, I was wearing this ridiculous party dress. All my ridiculous shit. I don't know if he remembered me, but he looked at me. I abandoned him. I abandoned my baby. 
(BEAT) Maybe I can't be a mother to him, is that something I can't get back. When he looked at me then, on the porch, he was mine again, he was my son. I seen so many men in the city, who I look in their eyes and they're lost. Whether he loves me back or not I'm gonna love my son I said. And he's never gonna get lost. Joe sitting up still, Sara lying beside him, maybe crying. He touches her hair. 
INT. APARTMENT 205 - EARLY MORNING 
A DOOR FRAME - kicked open with all the violence in the world. Old Joe sweeps into the small apartment, gun drawn. Suzie cooking in a robe, opens her mouth to scream. 
JESSE We're going now. We're gonna go to my truck, you're gonna CREAK. Cid on the stairs, sleepy eyed. Jesse, purely on instinct, spins and draws on Cid. Cid's POV - Jesse's gun, snapping like a snake, barrel leveled at him. Cid makes a strange shouting noise, falls back. Everything slows down. 
INT. APARTMENT 205 
Old Joe pushes the door open. Blackness within. 
INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM 
The room darkens. As if the sun passed behind a cloud. Jesse realizes it's a kid. Lowers his gun. But Cid is mid- scream, falling back, his foot misses the step and he tumbles down the stairs. Confused, terrified, falling. Joe runs into the foyer, to catch Cid. Sara runs behind him. The room is very dark now. Knick-knacks around the room rattle, then LIFT INTO THE AIR. All of them. Floating. Spinning. Sara's LIGHTER, on the coffee table: it RISES into the air. 
INT. APARTMENT 205 
Old Joe readies his gun, staring into the blackness. But his eyes lower. He touches his temple. Remembering. 
INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (OLD JOE'S MEMORIES) 
Fog clears - Joe is almost to Cid, who is still tumbling, nearly at the bottom of the stairs. 
INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER / LIVING ROOM (NORMAL) 
But just before he reaches him, Sara shoves Joe from behind. Shoving him TOWARDS THE FRONT DOOR. He's confused but her face is set. Cid hits the hardwood floor of the foyer, face contorted with rage now, hand raised to Jesse, palm outstretched. Screaming. His scream louder than it should be. 
Bigger things in the living room RISE OFF THE GROUND. Chairs. The couch. And Jesse. He rises five feet in the air, terrified. Sara pulls Joe through the front door, and he looks back and sees Jesse suspended in the air and Cid on the ground screaming like an animal, and just as they cross the threshold, Jesse explodes in a bright red fan of blood. 
INT. APARTMENT 205 
Old Joe's face. Remembering. 
INT. FARMHOUSE FOYER (OLD JOE MEMORY) 
Frozen in a tableau - Cid screaming, raw power. Jesse EXPLODING. A bright red fan. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH 
Joe and Sara fall out and down the stairs. The front door and windows EXPLODE in a burst of splinters and glass. 
INT. APARTMENT 205 
Old Joe's eyes lift. Realizing. 
OLD JOE The Rainmaker. A bare bulb hanging from the ceiling turns on. A six year old girl's room. But the only person in it is Kid Blue. He shoots Old Joe with a blue tazer. Old Joe hits the ground, mouth foaming, paralyzed. Knowing the answer now, knowing the who and the how but helpless and defeated. Kid Blue kicks him in the face. 
CID 
INT. ABE'S OFFICE 
A Gat Man circles a spot on the map in red ink, Sara's farm. 
GAT MAN 1 He's there. Lost his signal five minutes ago, right after he sent word he had him. Joe. Abe slumps in a chair, taking oxygen from a tank. 
ABE Call everyone, every Gat Man in the city, call âem here. Gather em all up here first. No mistakes this time. We're gonna take an army to that farm, all at once, and sweep it like hellfire. Now. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING 
From a high vantage point. Cars, bikes, Gat Men on foot, all heading towards the club. An army, all meeting at the Belle Aurore. Massing to attack. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING 
Moments after the blast. Joe and Sara lie in the dirt. Jesse's TRUCK parked nearby. Joe stirs first. Stands shakily. The front door jam is splintered. Windows broken. He goes inside. Sara gets up, staggers in after him. 
SARA Cid! Cid! 
JOE (O.S.) Cid! 
EXT. BACK OF FARMHOUSE 
Joe bursts out of the screen door, holding his Blunderbuss and wiping off Jesse's gat. Bloody Cid-sized footprints lead out the screen door and streak across the lawn, into the corn. Sara comes out after Joe, sees him heading for the corn. 
Old Joe weaves his way through the backstage area, chucking grenades in front of him, then unloading his automatic rifle into the smoky aftermath. And with a mixture of dumb luck and skill from years of being gangland muscle takes out Gat Man after Gat Man. The corridors are tight, twisty. Old Joe uses that. Throwing grenades. Blasting away. Purging. Killing everyone he lays eyes on. Wiping them out. All the bad guys. It's horrible. Men maimed, bleeding and crying, dying the way people actually die from gunshots. Old Joe forges on, deeper. 
INT. ABE'S OFFICE 
Empty. Old Joe kicks the door open. Takes it in, the office. Hammer on the desk. He reloads a gun. Eyes find the door to Abe's inner den. 
INT. ABE'S DEN 
Abe and two Gat Men, guns out, crouched behind the table. Watching the door. A display screen shows Old Joe on the other side. Abe, eyes dull. Shouts at the door 
ABE Joe. Guess I put the gun in that kid's hand, huh Joe. Guess everything comes back around. Like your goddamn ties. 
INT. ABE'S OFFICE 
Old Joe. Breathing hard. Reloaded. Closes the gun. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 
Joe breaks out of the corn, panting. He steps out into the middle of the highway. Storm clouds on the horizon. He cleans and readies his Blunderbuss. 
INT. COAT CHECK - LATER 
Kid Blue's eyes flutter open. He lifts himself painfully. Checks his chest. Most of the shot caught his shoulder, his chest is grazed. The Gat Men in the hall. Big Craig. All dead. 
INT. BACKSTAGE 
Kid Blue wanders the smoky halls. Dead and dying men. 
INT. ABE'S DEN 
Abe, shot once in the head, twice in the chest. Kid Blue stands over them. Stunned. Tears well in his eyes. Then on the wall, he sees the map. The farm circled in red. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN - MORNING 
Clothes and boxes piled in the back of Jesse's truck. Sara loads one last bundle. Calls to Cid, in the front seat. 
SARA Ok baby, we're going. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 
Joe waits. Then, a CLOUD OF DUST on the distant highway. He tenses. The cloud gets closer. It is a truck. An armored truck. Joe squints. It's the ARMORED TRUCK that Kid Blue loaded his gold bricks into. The front windshield blown in. The truck stops fifty feet away, and Old Joe steps out. He throws a gold bar, which lands in the dusty highway between them. 
OLD JOE Bon jour. You take this truck, you take your money, and you go live your life. No one's coming after you. I fixed it. 
JOE And you go kill the boy. That's how you fix it. 
OLD JOE That's how. You got your life back, you better think right now about what that's worth to you. 
JOE My life? Your life. Becoming you. 
Joe raises his Blunderbuss and FIRES. Too far away, the shot scatters. The old man flinches, backs away. Joe walks forward towards Old Joe, stepping over the gold. 
OLD JOE Stupid little shit! You let him live, he's gonna take away everything that's yours, everything that's mine! You seen what the boy's gonna become. 
JOE I haven't seen that yet. Joe fires again, close enough now to draw blood off Old Joe's chest and knock him back. Out of nowhere a SLAT BIKE careens around the van, which has until now blocked our line of sight down the highway. Kid Blue. The bike clips Joe's leg, sending him spinning violently to the dusty pavement. The bike shoots off down the highway, a cloud of dust in its wake. It takes a hundred yards for the Kid to pull it to a stop and spin it around. Joe is hurt bad. He grapples for his blunderbuss. Kid Blue guns the engine, gat in hand. Levels it, steady as a rock. Joe shoots at the Kid, but he's out of range, the gun fires scattershot. Kid Blue fires, a bullet hits dangerously close to Joe. Panicked, Joe begins firing at the pavement around him, round after fiery round. Kicking up dust. Lots of dust. Raising a cloud. KID BLUE'S POV - zooming towards Joe, now obscured in a cloud of dust and smoke. He fires his gat into the cloud, tries to slow the bike but can't in time. In the dust cloud Joe hears the bike roaring down upon him. He covers up and when he feels the bike roaring past blindly FIRES his buss. A moment later the bike emerges from the dust cloud. Without a driver. It skids, crashes. When the dust clears away Joe lies still, arms over his head. 
Besides him, the broken remains of Kid Blue. Painfully, Joe raises himself. Then realizes: Old Joe is gone. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE FRONT LAWN 
Sara starts the truck up. 
SARA Here we go. Give it a wave goodbye. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD 
They roll down the dirt road that leads to the highway. At the far end of it, at a distance but walking towards them, is the dark figure of Old Joe. Gun in hand. Sara hesitates a minute, then guns it. Straight for him.

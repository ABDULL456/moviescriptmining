1 EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT 1 
From a distance and through the trees we see a raging hell fire engulfing a small two story house. It burns and burns. Out of nowhere a man bursts through a second story window, lands hard and rolls to smother his burning clothes. He crawls away and staggers up and for a moment looks as if he might run back into the flames. But the heat is unbearable. He runs toward us then past us through black shadows. We cannot see his face, 
1A EXT. WINDOW - EARLY MORNING (WINTER 1930S) 1A 
Glass in a weathered window glitters with early morning sun. A rock shatters one of the remaining glass panes! 
2 EXT. YARD - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 2 
The rock thrower, TOM ( 10) is hightailing it away from an isolated Appalachian SHACK as the door bangs open, a shotgun barrel appears, and a chicken comes SQUAWKING out from under the porch! Thinking he's sure to be shot, Tom runs into the old barn! 
3 INT. BUSH'S BARN - EARLY MORNING/CONTINUOUS 3 
Panting in terror, Tom is hunkered down in strips of light, trying to see through the cracks. There is a loud SNORT and the huge face of some kind of beast suddenly appears at his shoulder. Tom jumps, panicked, just as a SHADOWY FIGURE creeps into the barn and levels a glinting shotgun at him! Tom freezes, bends over, and throws up! When Tom looks up, a ray of light reveals the half face of a fierce gray bearded man, FELIX BUSH. He is holding out a handkerchief to the boy. Shaking hard, Tom hesitates then takes it and wipes his mouth. Bush pushes open the door and gives Tom a sad look that the boy will never forget before waving him away. 
4 EXT. BUSH'S BARN - MORNING 4 
Looking back over his shoulder, Tom runs for the road. Two of his BUDDIES are already kicking up dust. BUSH (72) steps into the sun and watches the boy run off with a look of muted anger, sadness, and something much deeper. 
5 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 5 
Bush enters the barn to check on his companion. MULE is older than Bush in mule years and just as gray. He wears an old mule blanket everywhere to keep out the cold. He fidgets nervously from all the excitement. Bush comforts him. 
BUS H Just a boy, that's all. 
6 SERIES: 6 7 Bush rips down an old faded sign at the road and posts a 7 fresh one:'No Damn Trespassing/Beware of Mule'. Bush checks the road in both directions. All clear for now. 8 Bush splits firewood with powerful cleaving strokes. Mule 8 dozes in the shade. Bush sees a Model-T approach and turn into his road, right past his new sign. He glances at his shotgun leaning against the shack. The Model-T comes to a shaky stop. A MAN climbs out, sees Bush swinging the axe and approaches with trepidation. 
HORTON Mornin', sir. 
BUSH Hard life if you can't read.. 
HORTON Pardon? I'm uh, Reverend Gus Horton, sir, how you doing? Bush stops his swing and turns and stares coldly at Horton. 
BUSH Don't need saving, preacher. 
HORTON Uh, well, Mr. Wiley Starke has passed on, sir. His funeral is tomorrow and I thought you might want to know since.. 
BUSH 
(SOFTLY) What got him? 
HORTON Just got old, sir. 
BUSH Yeah, well.. Bush returns to chopping wood. Feeling awkward, Horton hesitates, starts for his car, stops. 
HORTON Mr. Starke told me that you and him ran away from home when you were 6 years old. Is that true? 
BUSH I talked him into it. Bush doesn't turn, just keeps chopping. 
HORTON Well.. anyway.. I.. alright.. Horton shrugs, get in his car, and leaves. Bush strikes the log hard and a cleaved piece goes flying. 
BUSH Bout time for me to get low. 
HORTON Get what? 
BUSH Down to business Bush reaches into his overalls and puts a balled-up wad of MONEY on the pew. Horton's eyes bulge. 
BUSH Need a funeral. Horton looks up from the money. 
HORTON For who? 
BUSH Me. Buddy peers around from the vestibule, listening, curious as hell, until Kathryn pulls him back. 
HORTON For you? (off Bush's impatient nod) You want to buy a funeral for you? 
BUSH Am I not talking right? 
HORTON No, yes, I'm sorry. Are you sick sir? 
BUSH Everybody dies. 
HORTON True, but.. 
BUSH I don't take care of my bones it won't get done, will it? 
HORTON All right, I see. Well the church can help you get your affairs in order, arrange a service.. Horton glances at the strange wad of money again. 
BUSH What would you say? 
HORTON About what? 
BUS H Me. 
HORTON A eulogy? I.. don't know. What do you want me to say? 
BUSH Say what you'd say right now to my face. 
HORTON Well. I uh, I don't know much about you, Mr. Bush. I mean, I've heard stories but.. 
BUSH What stories? Bush leans in and stares into Horton. It feels like everything in the world stops dead. Buddy peeks in again, this time Kathryn peeks too. 
HORTON Just stories.. (off Bush's intense look) .you know, people talking. 
BUSH What kind of stories? Say one. 
HORTON Sir.. my mother used to say that gossip is the devil's radio.. 
(UNFORTUNATE ASIDE) .not that she didn't play that radio at full volume now and then, bless her heart, but.. (back to business) .what matters when you come to the end of your life is that you're ready for the next one. Have you made peace with God, sir? 
BUS H I paid. Horton has no idea what Bush means. He looks at the money, back at Bush. 
HORTON Well.. you can't buy forgiveness, Mr. Bush. It's free. But you do have to ask for it. 
BUSH Nothing in this world is free, preacher. 
Bush abruptly grabs his money and starts out. His hand bangs into the pew and the money FALLS. Buddy stares wild-eyed at the big wad of money then drops back into the vestibule. Bush storms past Buddy, Kathryn and the baby like a hot wind. 
20A EXT. CHURCH - DAY 20A 
(DISTANTLY HOPEFUL) Is there a body? 
BUDDY No, the old man did the beating. Never seen anything like it. 
FRANK Social event of the year and I missed it. Frank lowers the paper so just his eyes appear. He has no southern accent and doesn't look small town. 
FRANK Read the paper today? (off Buddy's no) Something strange is happening in the world right now. 
BUDDY What? 
FRANK People are dying in bunches. (off Buddy's look) Everywhere. But here. He puts the paper down and studies his socks. 
FRANK I wonder what the odds are of a funeral home going broke? I mean you have a business everybody on earth needs, you can't make that work, it's got to be you right? And yet.. I don't know.. what do you do when people won't die? 
BUDDY Well.. 
FRANK Onethingabout Chicago, people knowhowto die; they drown, get runover,shot, whatever it takes. 
BUDDY We get it done down here, we're just not in a hurry about it. 
FRANK It's them or us. Frank sighs and stares forlornly out at a casket. 
BUDDY 
(QUIETLY) I might know someone who is looking for a funeral. Frank's eyes crawl over to him. 
25 OMITTED 25 
30 EXT./INT. FRONTAGE ROAD/FRANK'S CAR - DAY 30 
The Quinn Funeral Home Packard Hearse makes it way down the road. Frank drives as Buddy searches ahead. 
FRANK How much did he have? 
BUDDY It was all wadded up. 
FRANK Ooo, hermit money. That's good. Buddy sees Bush's signs. 
BUDDY There it is.. 
31 INT/EXT. FRANK'S CAR/FRONTAGE ROAD - DAY 31 
They stop at Bush's sign: 'No Damn Trespassing." Frank squints up at the old shack and doesn't like what he sees at all. Buddy opens his door but Frank doesn't. 
BUDDY What are you doing? 
FRANK You've been wanting a shot at sales.. 
BUDDY But.. 
FRANK As of right now, you're on commission. (off Buddy's look) Remember; foot in the door, establish trust, and drop the hammer. Buddy hesitates, crawls out, and eyes the shack. 
BUDDY I'd feel better if you'd go too. 
FRANK No doubt but if you don't do this by yourself, you won't know if you're any good. And you'll never be any good if you don't know you are. Go get him! 
32 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 32 
BUDDY There's two sides to every story. As Bush puts some rabbit on Buddy's old yellowed plate.. 
BUSH People say that. But they don't mean it. They think what they think and they don't want to know anything else. 
BUDDY Yes, sir, but I think people are so scared of what they don't know that they make things up to feel better about it. 
BUSH Like life after dying. Heaven. 
BUDDY 
(THINKS) I hope that part's true, don't you? 
(BEAT) But I don't think we know the actual truth about much of anything. I know I don't. I'm just guessing most of the time. Bush gives Buddy a closer look and motions for him to try the rabbit. Fearing the worst, Buddy bends into the steam, takes a cautious bites and mutters with shocked surprise.. 
BUDDY Lord, that's good.. 
BUS H You boys been coming out here to throw rocks through my window for 20-30 years. 
BUDDY I never.. 
BUSH Ya'll know lots of stories about me? 
BUDDY 
(SQUIRMS) Yes, sir, I guess, but.. 
BUSH Tell one. 
BUDDY I'd rather not. Bush eases forward, his eyes slit. The old Bush is back. 
BUSH I rather you did. 
BUDDY (startled/leans back) Well. When I was kid I heard you killed some men in a fist fight. 
BUSH Is that all? Bush leans back stone-faced. In the silence, Buddy looks over again at the wondrous carving of the mule on the window sill, at the big ears and long face that are being born from the rough block. It makes him smile. But when he glances back, Bush is staring a hole through him. 
BUS H What's your name again? 
BUDDY Buddy Robinson, sir. 
BUS H Well, if I need you -- I know where you are. It sounds almost like a threat. It shorts Buddy out. He stops eating and realizes that Bush has taken another turn and that he's been dismissed. 
34 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 34 
Buddy heads to the hearse, glancing back over his shoulder. As he recalls his encounter, he stops, looking back at the shack. The old legend has gotten deep under his skin. 
35 OMITTED 35 
35A EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD 35A 
The morning sun breaks over the mountains. 
36 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - MORNING 36 
Bush is on the porch, straining boiled herbs, grass, and bark into a jar. There is something not right with him and he knows it. While the medicine cools he looks out across the mountain and draws a deep breath. 
37 EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MORNING 37 
FRANK Whatever you want, flowers.. 
BUSH No. 
FRANK Burial plot.. 
BUSH Got it. 
FRANK A service? 
BUSH Party. 
FRANK A what? 
BUSH A party. 
BUDDY What kind of party? 
BUSH Funeral party. Stumped for once in his life, Frank looks at Buddy. Then years of honed instincts surge back to life. 
FRANK We can do that. 
42 INT. FUNERAL HOME/OFFICE - DAY 42 
As they come back into the office.. 
BUSH And I want to be there. Frank goes behind his desk. Buddy and Bush start to sit.. 
FRANK You will be, I guarantee it. 
BUSH I want to be there now. 
BUDDY You want to be at your funeral.. party.. alive? (off Bush's nod) But.. it's not a funeral if you're not, you know, deceased.. 
FRANK Hold on now, it's a detail, we can look at it. 
BUDDY Pretty big detail. 
Frank cuts Buddy a look then smiles at Bush. 
FRANK So you'd like to have a funeral party while you're alive so you can go? 
BUSH Yes or no? 
FRANK Yes. Buddy is lost. 
FRANK Buddy, get some paper. We need to make of list of who Mr. Bush wants to invite.. As Buddy starts to get up. 
BUSH Sit down. Buddy sits right down. 
BUSH I want everybody to come who's got a story to tell about me. 
FRANK Say again. 
BUDDY That probably covers 4 counties.. Bush shoots him a look. Frank shoots him a look. Buddy thinks about how great an outdoor life would be. 
BUSH Then I want 4 counties worth of people at the party. 
Bush stands in front of a full length mirror. He has on a decent black suit, pinned to be hemmed, and a plain white shirt, open at the collar. It is a startling change. But we still can't tell what he is thinking. Buddy is staring at him with honest disbelief. Frank is quietly trying to get Mr. Feldman to lower the price for the suit. He looks over and double-takes Bush. 
FRANK Son of a bitch, it's almost worth it. 
BUSH 
(TO BUDDY) What do you think? 
BUDDY I wouldn't know you, sir. 
BUSH Maybe the Devil won't either. Might work out. 
(TO FRANK) Where's the shoes? 
FRANK Well, normally people don't wear shoes in a casket so.. (off Bush's scowl) .what are you, about a 10D? 
54 INT. FELDMAN'S CLOTHING STORE - MOMENTS LATER 54 
Buddy stands beside Frank who is still trying to get a deal on the clothes. Bush walks up with two pairs of pants and two new shirts, puts them on the counter, gives Frank a hard look, and walks away. Frank looks down at the clothes, over at Buddy. 
FRANK Pretty optimistic taking a change of clothes to the grave. (calls over his shoulder) How you set for underwear? 
BUSH (O.S.) Don't wear none. 
FRANK One question too many. 
55 OMIT 55 
56 INT. HEARSE - DAY 56 
Everyone is back in the hearse. Something is eating at Frank. 
FRANK I don't mean to be nosey but uh.. how do you know Mattie? 
BUSH She's a peach. Frank and Buddy cut Bush a look. He looks ahead. 
BUSH We had a go. Frank nearly drives off the road. 
57 INT. FUNERAL HOME/ FRANK'S ROOM - NIGHT 57 
Late night Poker. Cigarette smoke drifts into the air. Frank, Carl, Rev. Horton, Mattie, and RAY, a banker, are at the table. Ray has the untouchable presence of someone privileged which appears to be driving Frank up a tree tonight. Horton gathers up his winnings. 
HORTON "The Lord loves a cheerful giver.." 
MATTIE Oh please.. you think the Lord's taking sides in a poker game in a funeral home? Horton shrugs and points to the divine evidence. 
FRANK If He is, the Divine's cheating. 
RAY Exactly. 
FRANK Don't agree with me Ray, it makes me doubt myself. 
Ray sighs and studies his perfectly cut nails. 
RAY I would have turned down your loan if you were my own dear mother, Frank. 
FRANK You made my point and don't even know it. 
HORTON Amen. 
FRANK Let's play some cards. 
RAY Oh for God's sake, face it Frank, you're broke. This is not about cards. It's a declaration meant to embarrass Frank in front of everyone. Frank feels their eyes on him as he starts to pull off his watch. Ray waves it off. 
RAY Please. I've won that 4 times already. 
FRANK It's who has it last that counts. 
CARL Say what you want but if there hadn't been anybody there the other day he would've killed me. And I guarantee you it wouldn't have been his first time. It sounds true and everyone is quiet except Mattie. 
MATTIE Everybody knows you started it. (off his glare) Don't look at me like that. I remember when you were born. You were the sweetest little boy. What is wrong with you? Momentarily shamed, Carl's face softens and we can see a better man there. He struggles to hold on to it but.. 
CARL I made a mistake. But there's a line.. and he crossed it.. and everybody knows that too. Ya'll go on and have a party with the devil for his money but I'll dance on his grave someday. Carl snatches his few dollars up and heads out. 
HORTON You kind of hate to admit it when it comes to Carl but he's got a point. You don't know what Bush is doing. What if he just wants to get everybody in one place so he can turn his shotgun on them? 
MATTIE He wouldn't.. 
HORTON I looked in his eyes. The truth is nobody knows what he's capable of. Maybe even he doesn't know. She looks into him. Frank starts to deal the cards. 
RAY Go ahead and lay your watch down, Frank. But I am going to keep it this time, alright, on principle. 
FRANK I got an idea. Let's try something different. 
(TO RAY) The cards in your sock? Leave'em there. Everyone freezes. Ray shakes his head. 
RAY What are you trying to pull now? 
FRANK You really think you're that good that nobody sees? 
RAY Sees what? 
FRANK You cheat at everything you do. Even at the bank, you loan people just enough to get'em deeper in so you can foreclose on them. 
RAY You are a pathetic man. And a goddamn.. 
FRANK Am I? Then stand up and roll down your socks. (a deep dark look) Stand up or I'll stand you up. Ray looks around the table and suddenly realizes that he is irreversibly exposed and alone. The sound of Frank's chair scraping the floor makes him jerk up. 
He walks out, trying to find his old confident rhythm and failing. Everyone sits in uneasy silence. 
58 INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 58 
Horton waves and walks out, leaving the door open. Frank walks Mattie to the door, helping with her coat, trying to work up his nerve to say.. 
FRANK I'll walk you home. 
MATTIE No. Thank you. 
FRANK 
(HURT) You sure? (off her firm nod) You're not going to play anymore, are you? 
MATTIE Oh, I don't know. Thank you for inviting me though. 
FRANK I'm sorry about the..we don't always fight, okay, we do, but he's had that coming for.. 
ANNOUNCER Okay. Now I have to say that you don't look quite like you do on the posters. 
BUSH I got pruned. 
ANNOUNCER Well, you're a bit of a local legend, sir. I was a little nervous about our interview. I've heard some pretty wild stories.. 
BUSH Like what? 
ANNOUNCER Well uh, just.. from what I understand, you want everyone who has a story about you to come and tell it. Is that right? 
BUSH You come and tell yours. 
ANNOUNCER Thank you. Now how long have you been living out there by yourself? 
64 INT. MATTIE DARROW HOUSE - NIGHT/CONTINUOUS 64 
Mattie is cutting the stems of some lovely yellow flowers and arranging them in a vase. 
BUSH (O.S.) 40 some years. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) 40 years with nobody to talk to? 
BUSH (O.S.) First 38 are the hardest. 
Mattie grins. 
65 INT. WCGM - CONTINUOUS 65 
ANNOUNCER But why would you do that, Mr. Bush, shut yourself off like that? Frank isn't happy with this but Buddy wants to hear. 
BUSH Come to the funeral and maybe you'll find out. 
ANNOUNCER You heard it here on WCGM, folks, find out the answer to the mystery February 16.. 
BUSH One more thing, boy. FRANK and Buddy tense. What's this? 
66 INT. DARROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 6 6 
Mattie tenses at the sound in Bush's voice. 
BUSH (O.S.) Gonna be a drawing. 
ANNOUNCER (O.S.) What kind of drawing, sir? 
BUSH You buy a ticket for $5.00 The day of the funeral we draw names. Then when I die, the winner gets my place, 300 acres of timber that hasn't been touched in 40 years. Mattie accidentally cuts a bloom off of a flower. 
67 INT. WCGM - SAME 67 
Dead air. The kid, Frank, and Buddy are all staring at Bush. 
ANNOUNCER For 5 dollars? 
BUSH Send it to the Quinn Funeral Home. Frank's eyes light up like fiery pinwheels and he almost yelps! Buddy looks oddly perplexed and sad. 
ANNOUNCER You heard him! If you want a chance to win 300 acres of virgin timber worth thousands and thousands of dollars, send 5 dollars along with your name and address to.. (off Frank waving and pointing to himself) Frank Quinn at Quinn Funeral Home. As the Announcer begins a song, Bush moves his head in time with the music. Frank and Buddy rush into the control booth. 
FRANK 
72 EXT. BUSH'S LAND - DAY/LATER 72 
Mattie and Bush walks side by side through the last of the glimmering light and shadows beneath the trees. It is a chilly and Mattie's cheeks are flushed. She is enchanted by the place. Bush tries to hide how winded he is.. 
MATTIE It really is beautiful. Probably looked like this everywhere a hundred years ago. 
BUSH You leave things alone, they know what to do. 
MATTIE Like you? 
BUSH No, Ma'am. I don't know what to do about anything much. 
MATTIE You've been alone a long time. 
BUSH Some people are more suited to it than others, I reckon. 
46A. 
MATTIE That's funny cause I never thought that it'd suit you. I knew you wouldn't be like anybody else but.. no one to talk to, no one to.. be with.. never. He looks into her then looks away at something. 
BUSH How you sleeping these days, girl? 
MATTIE How am I what? 
BUSH You sleep good? 
MATTIE No, not lately. How'd you know? He veers off the path and pulls up a plant and brings it back to her. 
BUSH Chamomile, it's good when the nights get long. Helps you nod off. She takes it and smiles up at him. 
BUSH Want to go on a ways? 
MATTIE Yes. 
BUSH Would you stay for supper? 
MATTIE I don't want to be any trouble. 
BUSH A supper guest every 30-40 years is not much trouble, Girl. 
MATTIE Alright then. He holds out his arm. 
BUSH Better stay close, some big old wild cats been eating my chickens.. She looks around and takes his arm. 
BUSH .or maybe it was me.. She snorts and slaps his arm but doesn't let go.. 
73 OMITTED 73 
74 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - NIGHT 74 
They enter the dark room together. Bush lights a lantern, gets a chair from a corner and holds it out for her. She sits and watches him check a cast iron pot on the warm stove and put a log on the fire. She notices the beautiful table. 
MATTIE You always were good with your hands. He puts a glass of tea in front of her and sits down. 
BUSH You still play the piano? 
MATTIE I teach a few girls. 
86 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 86 
Frank is hopelessly lost in a sea of envelopes. The phone is ringing off the hook, there are full sacks around him, and some Reporter is trying to take a picture through the front window. Frank scowls and lowers the blinds. 
87 EXT. MATTIE'S HOUSE - DAY 87 
Frank is at Mattie's door entranced by the troubled but beautiful piano music coming from inside. It stops abruptly when he knocks. In seconds, Mattie appears. 
FRANK Hey Mattie. He looks almost boyish and bashful as he drinks her in. 
FRANK Was that you? It was really.. 
MATTIE This is a surprise. 
FRANK Yeah, sorry. He stands, loving the view, forgetting why he is here. She waits it out as long as she can, not sure how she feels about this adoring look. 
MATTIE Was there something you..? 
FRANK Uh, yeah.. Help! 
MATTIE What? 
FRANK I'm up to my ears with this funeral and I thought, you know, we haven't had time to talk much lately so maybe you'd like to come over and rip open envelopes with me and 
MATTIE I'm sorry, I have lessons all afternoon. I have to get back in. 
FRANK Oh, okay, I just.. 
MATTIE Sorry. She slips back inside. Frank stares at the door. 
88 INT. MATTIE`S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 88 
Mattie leans against the door with her eyes closed. There is no student at the piano. 
89 OMITTED 89/90 89 
91 EXT. CHURCH/SOUTHERN ILLINOIS - AFTERNOON 91 
The hearse is parked in front of a beautiful white board church. 
91A INT. HEARSE - AFTERNOON 91A 
Close on Bush and Buddy. 
BUSH Don't say nothing. 
BUDDY To who? 
BUSH You can say "hi". Bush gets out. Buddy sighs, mimes "Hi" and gets out. 
92 INT. ILLINOIS CHURCH ENTRY - AFTERNOON 92 
Buddy quietly creeps in through the front door, looks back over his shoulder, scowls, and enters the church. 93 He stops and looks around, awed by the beautifully serene 93 sanctuary. Now he sees a tall BLACK MAN (70) come out of an office door behind the pulpit, walk up the aisle, glancing out the window at the driveway, and then at Buddy. 
BUDDY Hi. 
CHARLIE Hello. Buddy is out of words that he is allowed to say. He glances at the door but Bush is not coming in. 
CHARLIE Don't you dare.. 
BUSH I built my own jail and put myself in it! And I stayed in it for 40 goddamn years! No wife, no kids, no friends! That's not enough? 
CHARLIE You know it isn't. 
BUSH (tears welling up) Well. Why don't you come and say that then, Charlie? Hell, say it all! I don't care. 
CHARLIE Not on your life. The air is so heavy you can't breathe it. Bush suddenly gets up and leaves. Buddy starts to follow. Charlie puts his hand on him to stay. They sit in silence a moment. 
CHARLIE How much do you know about him? 
BUDDY Almost nothing, sir. I just work at the funeral home. 
CHARLIE Do you know he built this church? 
BUDDY No?! 
(LOOKING AROUND) How's a man like him make something like this? I mean, I know he's a good carpenter but this is.. 
CHARLIE Magic? (off Buddy's look) Maybe it's the best of him, maybe he put his soul into it, I don't know. 
BUDDY What ya'll were talking about.. what did he do? Who was he supposed to tell? 
CHARLIE 
(THINKS) For him and God to know I guess. I wish I'd never been put between them, that's for sure. 
(BEAT) I will tell you that he showed up here half dead. I had just started preaching. Over the next 4 years we built this. 
BUDDY Are you coming to the funeral? Charlie sighs and looks around. 94A Omitted 94A 
95 INT. HEARSE/MOVING/PMP - NIGHT 95 
Buddy and Bush are both lost in thought. Finally.. 
BUDDY Can I ask you something? 
BUSH Do you have to? 
BUDDY Yes. What are we doing? Since the day you came into the funeral home, I don't think anything has happened that you didn't want to happen. I just don't know where it's going. 
BUSH There's a whole lot of things that you don't know. Like what a dog dreams. You can make up a story about him chasing rabbits but you don't know if there's rabbits in there or not. And he can't tell you, can he? 
BUDDY Not unless he's a very special dog. They snort together. 
BUSH People don't say what they mean either so you don't really know any more about them then you do about that dog's dream. 
BUDDY But what..? 
BUSH 
(LOOKING AWAY) That time you left my house I saw you stop and look back. You wanted to know what could make somebody like me. (off Buddy's uneasy look) Well here you are, son, here you are. 
96 INT. FUNERAL HOME - EVENING 9 6 
Frank is putting money into a casket. He checks his watch. 
FRANK The cut's not bad but how's the head? He moves his finger across Buddy's eyes. 
FRANK Follow it. He looks him over carefully. He's had experience. 
FRANK Dizzy? Double vision? Nauseous? (off Buddy's no) You'll be okay. Did you see who it was? 
BUDDY No. I was putting the money in.. heard glass breaking.. locked up the casket quick and.. boom.. 
FRANK You did good. 
BUDDY Doesn't feel good. 
108 INT. DARROW HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - LATER 108 
Mattie sits beside a fire, knitting a baby blanket by an oil lamp. All at once the lights sputter on, the radio lights up, warms, and begins to PLAY, as a KNOCK at the door.. 
109 INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR/DARROW HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 109 
Mattie pulls the door open. Bush is standing there soaking wet, breathing hard, holding his shotgun. She draws back reflexively. He looks into her. 
BUSH Please, Ma'am. 
110 INT. DARROW HOUSE/BEDROOM - NIGHT 110 
Bush stands with a towel around him, shivering. Mattie opens a dresser drawer. Inside the drawer, is the carefully arranged tableau of a watch, a ring, a stethoscope, and some clothes. She hates to disturb the drawer but pulls out a pair of black pants and a white shirt, lays them on the bed, and walks out. 
111 INT. DARROW HOME/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 111 
Mattie steps from the kitchen with a steaming mug as Bush comes down the stairs in clothes that are too loose. Still shivering, Bush steps uneasily in front of the fire. Mattie hands him the hot mug. He looks uneasily at the yellow flowers on the table nearby. 
BUSH Thank you. 
MATTIE What are you doing here? Burned through, a log falls in the fire. Bush jerks oddly and moves away. 
BUSH Can I sit a minute? She stares at him then nods at a chair. She keeps standing behind the other chair. He bends over the mug and seems to lock up inside. 
BUSH You want to know why I have your sister's picture on my wall? 
MATTIE I'm not stupid, Felix. No, I take that back. How long was it going on? She was already married when I met you. Were you just making up to me to get to her? Bush is so still he looks like a gargoyle. 
MATTIE If you're not going to talk, leave. 
BUSH Can you help who you love? Mattie's face tells us that she has asked herself that question many times. 
BUSH I've had 40 years to think about it and I still don't know. 
MATTIE I don't know either, so.. Slowly the gargoyle unfolds. His eyes drill into her. 
BUSH I want to tell you how it was. If you don't want me to, I'll go. Mattie sighs from down deep in her shoes then comes around and sits down. 
MATTIE Don't lie to me. When did you take up with her? 
BUSH I came to see you and she was there, hanging clothes on the line with your mama. Bush stares out the window so hard, Mattie turns to see what he is looking at.. 
BUSH She turned around.. (as Mattie turns back) .and.. I promise you that I did not know that I had a heart till right then. 
Tears well up in Mattie's eyes. 
FRANK Well, think about it, we could.. 
BUSH Don't know that I'm doing it. 
FRANK What?! 
BUSH Thinking to call it off. 
FRANK You can't! 
BUSH Damn well can if I want to. 
FRANK No no no, it's in motion! 
BUSH If I say no, it's no. Send the money back. 
FRANK You're killing me! I bought things, hired people.. promised money, everybody in town is hoping to.. 
BUSH I care about this town as much as they care about me. 
FRANK It's what you said you wanted and I've busted my ass for you. So why don't you want it anymore? You owe me that. 
BUSH 
(LONG BEAT) It was the end of the line, tell it all, get out of jail party. But I guess I ain't got the goddamn guts to open my own mouth and I can't get nobody to talk for me so the hell with it. And to hell with me. Bush grabs his shotgun and goes. Frank sits, stunned. 
115 INT. BUDDY'S HOUSE-EARLY MORNING 115 
Buddy sits at the breakfast table, holding his son. He opens and closes his eyes, checking out his vision. Kathryn, at the stove, sees him out of the corner of her eye. 
KATHRYN Are you having trouble seeing? 
BUDDY I see you're mad. 
KATHRYN I'm not mad. I'm concerned She shoves the skillet off the burner and comes to him. 
BUDDY 
(SQUINTS UP) No, you're mad. She tenderly touches his head. 
KATHRYN If I could get my hands on whoever did this, you'd see mad. 
FRANK (O.S.) Buddy! You up?! Frank rushes in, lifts a phantom hat to Kathryn, scrapes up a chair, pulls on the baby's toe, and looks at Buddy. 
FRANK Trouble. 
BUDDY What's the matter? 
FRANK Bush is pulling out. 
BUDDY What? 
FRANK What happened yesterday? 
BUDDY I told you, we went up to Illinois and met a preacher. 
FRANK But what happened? 
FRANK Reverend Jackson? (Charlie looks at hearse) Frank Quinn, Quinn funeral home. 
CHARLIE How'd you find me? Frank just smiles, takes off his hat, and offers his hand. Charlie gives him a long look and reluctantly motions him in. 
Frank enters, noting the clean simple home of man with an orderly mind. Charlie motions for Frank to sit down. 
CHARLIE I was going to play some dominos this afternoon. But something told me to stay home. I should have played dominos. Is he out there? 
FRANK Bush? No, sir. 
CHARLIE You sure? 
FRANK Pretty sure. 
CHARLIE Did you check the back? Frank snorts, liking Charlie immediately. 
FRANK You told Bush that you wouldn't come to the funeral? 
CHARLIE If he got that, why are you here? 
FRANK To help you rethink it. 
CHARLIE I don't need any help. 
FRANK Have you rethought it? (off Charlie's look) So there is a need. 
(BEAT) First off, Bush doesn't know I'm here. 
CHARLIE I wouldn't be so sure about that. (off Frank's look) He's got a way of making people do what he wants them to. Frank squirms, knows it true. 
CHARLIE Is he really a hermit? Frank whistles and takes Bush's poster out of his coat. Charlie jerks at the picture of the wild man. 
FRANK He came to see me after he'd been here, wants to call the party off. 
CHARLIE I don't care. 
FRANK Said he'd meant it to be a.. end of the line, tell it all, get out of jail funeral but that he didn't have the guts to open his mouth and he couldn't get anybody to talk for him. You know anything about that part? (off Charlie's sigh) At first he said he wanted everybody to come who had a story about him. But he didn't want to hear their bullshit stories, did he? Pardon my language. He wants to tell one, doesn't he? 
CHARLIE About time. 
FRANKFRANK Whatever he did, it's been locked up in him for 40 years and he can't get it out. (off Charlie's look) I think he told you. You may be the only person he told. And now he wants you to tell it for him. 
CHARLIE Because he won't. 
FRANK Or can't. 
CHARLIE Or won't. 
FRANK Or can't. 
(BEAT) At least he wants the truth to come out, give him that. 
CHARLIE 
(LONG STARE) I'll think about it. 
FRANK Is there a boarding house around here? 
BUSH Well.. what do you want to do? Buddy looks back at Bush. 
BUDDY I don't.. (realizing just then) I want to make this funeral for you if you want it. 
BUSH (a long look) Hell. Do it if you can. 
(BEAT) I guess for everyone like me, there's one like you, son. I about forgot that. Buddy holds out his hand to help Bush up but Bush forces himself up on his own and walks out.

130 INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE/SOUTHERN ILLINOIS - EVENING 130 
Charlie sits at his desk, staring blankly at his crooked stamp. Suddenly Fate in the form of Frank Quinn looms at the window. Charlie knows he is there but he won't look at him. 
131 INT. BUDDY'S HOUSE/BEDROOM- DAWN 131 
Buddy, Kathryn, and the baby are sleeping soundly. There is a SCRATCHING NOISE. Buddy sits up, grabs a baseball bat and falls back asleep. The scratching starts again. He opens his eyes, surprised to see the bat in his hand. He hears the scratching. He looks around, sees something at the window. He slides to the floor, crawls on his knees, and looks out. Frank is standing there, scratching on the screen. Behind him is Charlie, looking very unhappy about standing in the near dark in a small southern town, scratching on a screen. Buddy realizes what he is seeing and starts to smile. 
132 EXT. BUDDY'S HOUSE - DAWN 132 
Frank, Buddy, and Charlie are on the porch, watching the world come to life. Charlie looks as if he is hoping for some kind of sign from above. 
BUDDY I'm glad you decided to come, sir. 
CHARLIE Free will is not all that it's cracked up to be. 
BUDDY 
(AT FRANK) Did you take the money out of the casket? 
FRANK Yeah. 
BUDDY Why didn't you tell me?! 
FRANK I forgot. 
BUDDY You forgot?! Where is it? 
FRANK In the hearse, under the floorboards. Charlie remembers that Frank said he wasn't coming back and gives him a look. Buddy is giving Frank the same look. 
FRANK What? Nobody steals a hearse. Now all we got to do is take the Reverend here to Bush and.. 
BUDDY I forgot to tell you, Mr. Bush already said he would do it. 
FRANK You're shittin' me?! Charlie gets up and starts walking away.. 
CHARLIE Where can I catch a train? 
FRANK You can't leave you just got here. 
CHARLIE Watch and learn. 
FRANK Hold on.. 
CHARLIE Where's the station? 
133 EXT - BUSH'S LAND/ROAD - MORNING 133 A tractor pulling a trailer with a big old honking generator on it, a truck loaded with equipment and workers for the big event rumbles down a dirt road. The Quinn Funeral home hearse completes the unlikely parade. 
143 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 143 
The generator is working! And standing on the flat bed truck, which is now a stage, an ANNOUNCER introduces a hot blue grass group The crowd is huge now and listens as the group kicks off a song. Behind the stage Frank is collecting money from the boys who are selling the raffle tickets, making them turn their pockets inside out. The generator makes a strange noise, Frank eyeballs it, and it labors on. Buddy walks up, nudges Frank, and nods out at the huge crowd. Can you believe this?! Charlie walks up and says something that we cannot hear. 
144 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 144 
Pacing the cage, Bush peeks out the window. 
BUSH You asked for it you old ornery sonofabitch, now what are you gonna do? 
145 INT. BUSH'S BARN - DAY 145 
Frank, Buddy, and Charlie enter the barn and see Mule hitched to the wagon. On the back of the wagon is a simple and rustically elegant casket with the initials FB carved into the center board. It sobers them all. 
146 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/GULLY - DAY 146 
Carl, Gary, and Theman hide and watch Frank, Buddy and Charlie walk Mule and the wagon away from the barn and down the road. Carl eyes Bush's shack and starts for it. 
GARY Hey, hey, where you going? He said the woods.. 
CARL Closer. 
And he takes off. 
THEMAN He's crazy! 
147 OMITTED 147 
148 OMIT 148 
149 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 149 
The bluegrass fiddle player nods to the others to quickly end the song. Now we see why. Frank, Buddy, and Charlie have brought the wagon with the coffin into the field. Everyone quiets, remembering why they are here. They park the wagon behind the hearse. Frank and Charlie walk toward the stage. Buddy peels away. Frank calls after him to come with them to the stage but Buddy waves them away. He wants no part of that. He sees Kathryn and Horton threading their way through the crowd and moves toward them instead. Frank and Charlie climb the makeshift stairs up to the stage. Charlie sits down on a folding chair while Frank goes to the big microphone and stares with satisfaction at the huge Depression-era Woodstock crowd. 
FRANK Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen. I'm Frank Quinn of Quinn Funeral Home. Welcome to the live funeral party of Mr. Felix Bush! People don't know whether to clap or not. Some do and the rest of them pick it up. Buddy gets to Kathryn and hugs her and the baby. 
BUDDY Where's Mattie? 
KATHRYN She wouldn't come. I don't.. 
FRANK I've done some things in my life, but never this. Bet you haven't either, bet no one has. 
(MORE) 
FRANK (CONT'D) (winks back at Charlie) We try to make things predictable and safe but if we don't risk everything to get what we want, we don't want it enough. 
150 OMIT 150 
151 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - CONTINUOUS 151 
Frank finds Buddy in the crowd. 
FRANK The person who made all of this happen for us doesn't like the spotlight but Buddy Robinson is the heart of Quinn Funeral Home and I'm proud to know him. Buddy is embarrassed and moved. Kathryn's eyes soften. 
152 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 152 
Carl is sloshing gasoline onto the back porch while Gary and Theman keep nervous watch at the farendof porch. Suddenly Carl feels a shotgun's cold metal on his neck and the 45 being ripped from his belt and thrown to the ground. 
163 EXT. BURNING HOUSE - NIGHT 163 
A man on fire bursts through the second story window of a burning house. He lands hard and rolls across the yard to smother the flames. With his clothes still smoking, he unbelievably tries to run back into the hell. But the fire is too hot and he cannot. He screams like a mad man and runs into the trees.. 
164 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - DAY 164 
The crowd is motionless. Nothing is moving. It is as if the whole world has stopped. Frank, Buddy, and Kathryn are frozen. Bush and Mattie are looking into each other, one anguished soul to another. 
BUSH I don't know how I got out the window. 
(BEAT) 
(MORE) 
BUSH (CONT'D) No matter how many times I play it in my mind, I can't remember jumping. I thought I killed him, but maybe he pushed me, I don't know... (lost as ever..) I swear to you, if I left her in there.. everything I know about myself is a lie. But that don't matter. 
(BEAT) I didn't get her out, Little Bit, I didn't. I'm sorry. 
165 INT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 165 
Bush sits on the edge his bed. His face is drawn and haunted. The door open and closes. He doesn't look up. Mattie sits down beside him. Tears are streaming down her face. She lays her head gently on his shoulder. 
MATTIE Oh, Felix.. He sniffs her hair and tenderly touches it. 
BUSH Wonder if her hair would be white? 
166 EXT. BUSH'S LAND/FIELD - END OF DAY/MONTAGE 166 
A MAN chooses a winning raffle ticket from a wire cage. A poor YOUNG COUPLE with SEVERAL CHILDREN win the raffle! The promise of a new and better life begins for them. The big funeral party breaks up people wind their way home. The big old honking generator coughs off. Mule is lead back to the barn. The equipment is disassembled and loaded back on the truck. The microphone stands alone on the stage. He got it said. 
167 EXT. BUSH'S SHACK - DAY 167 
Buddy, Frank, Horton, Charlie, and Kathryn and the baby wait outside, giving Bush and Mattie time. Buddy takes the baby and holds it close. 
Finally Mattie and Bush come out of the shack and walk down to the others. No one knows what to say. Finally.. 
BUDDY How you doing, sir? 
BUSH Just fair, son. 
HORTON Carl said Ray paid them to set the fire. Paid them to break into the funeral home too. 
FRANK Can't stop pulling Aces out of his ass, can he? 
HORTON Spend his money on lawyers now. You know how thrifty they are. Frank motions to Buddy and they go to Bush. Buddy is still holding the baby, Bush looks tenderly at Buddy and the baby. 
BUSH What's his name? 
BUDDY Larry, Lawrence, after my dad, sir. 
BUSH He ain't gonna throw rocks at me, is he? 
BUDDY Not if knows what's good for him. 
BUSH You boys did good. Real good. Let's settle up. 
BUDDY We don't have to do that now. You get some rest.

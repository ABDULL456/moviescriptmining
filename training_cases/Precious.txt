A line at a time, the following quote appears over a black screen.

FADE IN: 
1   EXT HARLEM STREET ­ DAY                                          1 
A COLD WIND blows a bright red scarf tangled high on a street lamp. 
An iron waste bin is blown sideways into an intersection. A stray dog investigates it briefly, urinates and then moves on. 
A book bag drops onto the pavement. 
Visible from the waist down, a LARGE YOUNG WOMAN in a disintegrating leather jacket turns the waste bin upright and then maneuvers it onto the sidewalk. 
Once finished, her thick hands wipe each other until they stop abruptly. 
Here, for the first time, we see her PLUMP, YOUTHFUL, VACANT AFRICAN AMERICAN FACE. It is 16-YEAR-OLD PRECIOUS JONES. Something inside the bin has caught her attention. 
Precious gazes down upon a soiled and tattered paperback book as the breath from her nostrils steams. The title of the book staring back up at her is unintelligible. 
She pushes debris aside to get to it. 
The book plunges deeper into the trash, as if trying to flee. 
The sound of an ONCOMING CAR approaches. 
Precious pins the book against the bottom of the bin as the sounds of the oncoming car close in. 
Precious finally comes up with the book. Its title is still unintelligible. When she flips it over, however, the letters on the cover, which are facing us now, make sense. They read CRYSTAL STAIR: SELECTED WORKS BY LANGSTON HUGHES.

1   CONTINUED:                                                    1 The car sounds incredibly close. 
Precious looks sharply to her left. 
AN EERIE SKID precedes an eerier THUD! Precious, almost hit, falls back on to the pavement as her book skips across the intersection and down into a drain. 
She lays on the sidewalk pressed against the base of the street lamp with her eyes closed. 
The car reverses, skids, stops for a sec, shifts and SCREECHES off. 
The garbage bin, overturned yet again, rocks side to side until settling, to a stop. 
An ambulance eases up to the intersection. 
When the stoplight changes, the ambulance motors past Precious in no hurry. A moment later, its sirens BLARE and it speeds off into the distance. 
The stray dog returns, re-investigates the garbage bin, and turns to Precious. He licks her face. Tom Cruise walks up to her. 
Precious' still vacant eyes finally open to see Tom, and the red scarf falling from the street lamp towards her. Tom gives her a hand up. 
TOM (flirtatious) What's your name girl? 
Precious blushes. 
TOM What's your name? 
Precious still blushing, looks on the ground. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) My name is Precious Jones. I wanna take tap dance lessons. Mama said we can't afford it. 
A SCHOOL BELL RINGS. 
2A. 
R2   INT. INTERMEDIATE SCHOOL 111/HALLWAY - DAY                  R2 
The end of a final wave of students head to class. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Plus she say who wanna see me dancing anyway. I goes to I.S. 111. In Harlem. New York. Today I was almost late. That'd a been a problem. 
Precious scurries behind them donning the red scarf and lugging her book bag. 
3   INT. CLASSROOM ­ DAY                                             3 
Precious sits in the last row behind 26 children half her size, 3 years younger and mostly African American. Noise and projectiles fill the air. 
MR. WICHER -A FRAIL MAN IN A BOW TIE AND TWEED COAT, stands at the head of the class trying to establish order. 
Precious gathers her belongings. The other children watch every move in silence. When she reaches the front of the class ... 
PRECIOUS You gonna be okay Mr. Wicher? 
MR. WICHER (forcing a smile) Of course Precious. Thank you. 
An unconvinced Precious grins sadly as Mrs. Lichenstein motions for Precious to step out ahead of her. 
Mr. Wicher looks abandoned. The door closing behind Precious might as well be to a prison cell block. Noise inside the classroom returns immediately. 
R4   INT. SCHOOL CORRIDOR - DAY                                   R4 
Precious heads off down the wide hallway in silence. 
R5   INT. MRS. LICHENSTEIN'S OFFICE ­ DAY                         R5 
Precious waits among plants, plaques, pictures and file cabinets while Mrs. Lichenstein sits across from her reading from a file. 
Mrs. Lichenstein closes the file and sets it on the desk between them. 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN Are you pregnant? You're sixteen, still in junior high school and pregnant with your second child. Correct Claireece? Claireece are you pregnant again? 
Precious stares at the file without responding. 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN Do you have any thoughts about your situation? 
Precious shrugs her shoulders. 
(CONTINUED) 
R5   CONTINUED:                                               R5 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Claireece? 
Precious doesn't respond. 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN (beat) Claireece, I'm talking to you. 
Precious doesn't respond. 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN Claireece?! 
PRECIOUS Am I in trouble? 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN What? 
PRECIOUS Am I in trouble? 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN ...No. 
PRECIOUS (beat) Then I don't want to miss no more of maff class. 
Precious starts to rise. 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN (firmly) Sit down Claireece. 
Precious sits and sighs. 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN (beat) You know what I think? I think we should have a parent-teacher conference - me, you and your mom. 
PRECIOUS My muver is busy. 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN Well maybe I could arrange to come to your house. 
(CONTINUED) 
R5   CONTINUED: (2)                                               R5 PRECIOUS My muver wouldn't like that. 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN Well then Claireece, I'm afraid I'm going to have to suspend you. 
PRECIOUS For what? 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN You're pregnant. 
PRECIOUS That ain't fair. I ain' done nuffin! I doose my work. I ain' in no trouble. My grades is good... 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN Your attitude is one of total uncooperation and that won't help a thing... 
PRECIOUS (V.O.)                     MRS. LICHENSTEIN Now I heard everything. Nosy        I'm not the enemy here. If ass white bitch mad 'cause          h there's something going on at she can't come over my house.        ome that you would like to I don't be coming to this           talk about, you should feel bitch's house in Weschesser.        free to do so here. If you I'll be damned. I done heard        find that the added stress of everything. White bitch wanna       caring for your child is visit. Then I thought about         affecting your concentration, Mr. Wicher all alone up             that would be helpful to against the fools in his maff       know. class ... 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN Now according to our records, your mother also looks after the child. Is that correct? 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) No kids on her pictures. Maybe she jealous. I still don't say nuffin. 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN Are you in contact with the father? (beat) Is he at all involved in your child's care? 
No answer. 
(CONTINUED) 
R5   CONTINUED: (3)                                             R5 MRS. LICHENSTEIN Fine! If that's the way you wanna play it, we can do this all day. 
The hand on Precious' lap makes a fist. 
MARY Tell them assholes to stop ringing my bell. 
Here is our first good look at Mary. She wares way too much make up. 
Precious wipes her hands and heads for the door though Mary sits much closer to it. 
(CONTINUED) 
13   CONTINUED:                                                13 PRECIOUS (V.O.) No one ever ring the bell but crack addicts. I hates crack addicts. Give the ghetto a bad name. 
Precious presses TALK on the intercom. 
PRECIOUS Stop ringing the goddam buzzer motherfucker! 
Precious heads back to the dishes until ... 
ANNNT! The buzzer again. 
Precious returns to the intercom. 
PRECIOUS Stop ringing the goddam buzzer. 
ANNNT! 
PRECIOUS Stop it! 
ANNNT! 
PRECIOUS Stop it! 
MARY Press LISTEN stupid. 
Precious sighs and presses LISTEN. 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) It's Sondra Lichenstein for Claireece and Ms. Mary Johnston. 
Precious' face goes blank. Mary looks alarmed and mutes the television. 
MARY Who that Precious? 
PRECIOUS White bitch from school. 
14   EXT. 444 LENOX AVE. - NIGHT                                  14 
Mrs. Lichenstein stands by the buzzer bundled up. THUMPING RAP MUSIC FROM A CAR passes behind her. 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED:                                                14 She bounces lightly to the beat. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Lord, where is crack addicts when you need 'em... 
15   INT. 444 LENOX AVE. - NIGHT                               15 
Precious and Mary still try to sort this out. 
MARY What she want? 
PRECIOUS I don't know. 
MARY Ask her stupid. 
Precious presses TALK. 
PRECIOUS What you want? 
Precious presses LISTEN. 
MRS. LICHENSTEIN (O.S.) I want to talk to you about your education. 
MARY Eighty-six that bitch. 
Precious looks unsure. 
16   EXT. 444 LENOX AVE. - NIGHT                               16 
A young man exits the building smoking a cigarette. Mrs. Lichenstein puts her hands together, dramatically pleads for a smoke and gets one. 
She puts it in her mouth and lights hers to his. Bouncing to stay warm, she nods in gratitude as the man walks off. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) This bitch crazy. 'Sides, my muver don't want to get cut off welfare and that's what Mrs. Lichenstein comin' to visit result in. It's hard to believe a hoe dis retarded sposed to educate somebody. 
17   INT. 444 LENOX AVE. - NIGHT                                 17 
Precious presses TALK. 
PRECIOUS Git outa here Mrs. Lichenstein 'fore I kick your ass. 
ANNNT! 
Precious presses LISTEN. 
MARY Where you going? 
DUNK, CLINK, CLONK, CLANK -Precious opens 4 locks with swift precision. 
MARY You hear me talking to you?! 
Precious leaves slamming the door behind her. 
24   EXT. 444 LENOX AVE. -DAY                                  24 
We track with Precious as she exits her building. RUBY, A DARK-SKINNED HEAVY-SET LITTLE GIRL WITH A "NATURAL" HAIRSTYLE WHO COULD EASILY PASS FOR A YOUNGER PRECIOUS, trails Precious. A naked blond armless Barbie doll dangles by it's hair from Ruby's hand. 
RUBY Precious when we gon' play? 
PRECIOUS (without turning around) Ain' you s'posed to be in school? 
RUBY You said we was gon' play. 
PRECIOUS See, thas jus exackly why we ain' gon' be playin'. I never said nuffin like it. 
RUBY Why not? 
PRECIOUS Cause you a mess. Look at ya' -no style, no friends, no mama, no daddy. 
RUBY So?! I ain' the only one. 
Precious stops abruptly and turns around. 
PRECIOUS What you say?! 
RUBY ...nuffin. 
PRECIOUS Thas what I thought. 
Precious heads away into the distance. 
RUBY I check in wif you tomorrow Precious. 
PRECIOUS (O.S.) You do that. 
25   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            25 
Precious walks gazing upward. 
Street lamps pass beneath the sky as autumn leaves fall from nowhere. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) I'm lookin' up. Lookin' out for a piano to fall, a desk, couch, TV, Mama maybe? Always somethin' in the way. Alternative. I'm gon' see all about it. 
BOY'S VOICE Watch where you goin' Orca! 
Precious looks down to find three skinny boys, each much smaller than she, taunting her. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Then my mind come back down to Earf. 
2ND BOY Shut up fool, she gon' eat you. 
The boys burst out in laughter slapping hands and grabbing their crotches. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Boyz always been little things that laff and grab they selves -cept for when I's real big and pregnant wif my first baby. Then boyz don't say nuffin. They stand out the way real quiet like I'm Queen of England... 
Pointing at her leggings, the boys erupt some more. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Still, I wonder...what could I wear that boyz don't laff? 
Precious crashes to the ground. The boys look surprised a moment and then howl harder than ever. 
PRECIOUS I always be fallin like that when my mind be wanderin. Mama say I gonna fall to my death one day. Wonder what that be like? 
(CONTINUED) 
25   CONTINUED:                                                25 The boys continue to taunt her from above. Precious stares into space as if they aren't there. 
CUT TO: 
26   INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY                                      26 
Precious in Black leotards, fishnet stockings and patent leather shoes tap dancing away. She finishes her number as Tom Cruise walks into frame clapping. Tom gives her a hug and a friendly lick on the ear. 
27   EXT. STREET - PRESENT - DAY                                  27 
Precious continues to stare into space as a dog licks on her ear. 
28   EXT. 125TH STREET - DAY                                      28 
Precious walks amongst a crowd of people and stops to stare at the Hotel Theresa, a beautiful pre-war building. 
29   INT. HOTEL THERESA - DAY                                     29 
Precious enters the lobby. An older black man in a blue uniform sits in a chair reading the Daily News through thick glasses. 
He doesn't move, react, speak to or look at Precious as she passes him. 
CORNROWS Yup. The only other thing we need right now is income verification. Are you currently receiving AFDC? 
PRECIOUS No...My muver get AFDC for me and my daughter. 
CORNROWS Oh, you've had amniocentesis? 
PRECIOUS Huh? 
CORNROWS You said your mother has custody of you and your daughter? 
(CONTINUED) 
31   CONTINUED: (3)                                            31 PRECIOUS Not this baby! I got another one 'sides this coming. 
CORNROWS Oh I see. Your mother has custody of you and your daughter so you're on her budget. 
Precious nods. 
CORNROWS Okay, well I need a copy of your mother's budget and a current phone or utilities bill, okay? 
PRECIOUS I got to go get all that now? 
CORNROWS No, relax. We're just gonna give you a few tests -test your reading and math level, see where to place you. 
PRECIOUS What's the difference? 
CORNROWS Well, to enter G.E.D. classes a student should be able to read on an eighth-grade level. They should score 8.0 or better on the TABE reading test. 
PRECIOUS I was in ninfe grade at I.S. Ill. 
CORNROWS (smiling) Then you should have no problem. 
Precious doesn't look as convinced.

32   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY                                       32 
ECU - SHEET OF PAPER 
Precious neatly writes CLAIREECE P. JONES on the top of the page.

32   CONTINUED:                                                32 Precious sits alone behind a smattering of empty desks in a bright classroom. 
She looks over her test, exhales and starts to write. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
33   INT. CLASSROOM - LATER                                    33 
A TICKING CLOCK accompanies ...

...tapping feet 
...sweat 
...giant letters 
...tapping thumb 
...tapping pencil 
...frowns 
...giant numbers 
...eraser shreds 
...sighs 
BZZZPFFT! 
Precious looks up sharply. 
A square fluorescent light in the ceiling blinks and buzzes as if struggling to stay alive. 
We tilt down from the blinking light to find that we are in a different place ... 
34   INT. DIFFERENT CLASSROOM - DAY                            34 
A YOUNGER PRECIOUS with uncombed hair sits with her back to us in a bright pink dress. She is at the very back of the classroom. 
(CONTINUED) 
34   CONTINUED:                                                34 The many children seated in front of her are all blurs that gradually fade into darkness while raising their hands. 
Finally, she closes the door. 
PRECIOUS MA! !! 
No answer. 
PRECIOUS MA! !! 
MARY (0. S. ) What?! 
PRECIOUS I need some money. 
MARY (0. S. ) For what? 
(CONTINUED) 
39   CONTINUED:                                                   39 PRECIOUS Sumthin' to eat. My head hurt. 
MARY (0. S. ) (beat) How much you need? 
PRECIOUS Five dollars. 
MARY (O.S.) (beat) Come and git it then. 
The air changes. Time stands still. 
A look that is both childlike and gray comes over Precious' face. 
40   INT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY                                    40 
Large panties fall to the floor from beneath the sheets. Mary's knees widen beneath the covers. 
41   INT. 444 LENOX AVE. KITCHEN - DAY                            41 
A frozen Precious stares across the apartment for a brief eternity. 
Finally, she dashes for the front door, throws open the locks and bolts out of the apartment slamming the door behind her. 
MARY (O.S.) Where you going?! 
42   EXT. STREET - DAY                                            42 
Precious walks briskly. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) The other day I cried, felt stupid. Guess what...Fuck that other day. Thas why God or whoever make new days. Still hungry tho. 
Precious stops and looks up at something. 
Before her stands a fast food restaurant with a giant sign atop it that says KICKIN FRIED CHICKEN. 
Precious looks around, takes a deep breath and steps inside. 
43   INT. KICKIN FRIED CHICKEN - DAY                             43 
Precious approaches the counter with a strained "nonchalance". 
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN IN A HAIR-NET waits behind the register. 
Precious sets her notebook and pencil down on the nearest table. 
WOMAN What you want baby? 
PRECIOUS Give me a basket please. 
WOMAN Sides? 
Precious' eyes wander from the fry bin all the way over to a refrigerator towards the back. 
PRECIOUS Ain't sure. still thinkin'. Watchin' the weight you know. 
The woman chuckles and then leaves for the chicken. 
The digital clock on the wall reads 8:53. 
Precious whirls around to see A YOUNG MAN CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH spraying the door with glass cleaner and then wiping it from the bottom up. 
Precious turns back around to find her server selecting pieces of chicken from a huge tray with large silver tongs. 
The clock on the wall reads 8:54. 
Precious turns to the door again to find the young man still cleaning it. 
Precious turns back around to see her server returning with a basket of chicken. 
PRECIOUS Potato salad! Thas it. 
The woman nods, sets the chicken on the counter and heads back towards the refrigerator in one fluid motion. 
(CONTINUED) 
43   CONTINUED:                                                43 The young man wipes the top of the front door and looks to be about finished. 
MS. RAIN This is it. 
Ms. Rain looks at her watch, beckons Precious with one arm and disappears inside. 
MS. RAIN (O.S) Time's a wastin'. 
(CONTINUED) 
B49   CONTINUED: (2)                                           B49 Precious still doesn't move. 
Ms. Rain appears again. 
MS. RAIN You in or you out? This door closes in thirty seconds. 
Ms. Rain disappears again. 
Precious' feet finally transport her into the bright doorway. Its blinding light envelopes her completely. 
50    INT. CLASSROOM -DAY                                          50 
Ms. Rain's desk sits before six smaller ones situated in a semi-circle. Four of them are occupied by girls roughly Precious' age: 
RHONDA JOHNSON -AFRICAN AMERICAN, STOCKY AND EVEN TALLER THAN PRECIOUS, RITA ROMERO -LATIN DESCENT, MEDIUM BUILD, FRIENDLY FACE AND DRESSED ENTIRELY IN BLACK, JERMAINE HICKS WIRY, LEAN, SEATED AND DRESSED LIKE A BOY and CONSUELO MONTENEGRO - LATIN DESCENT, PETITE GLOWING AND GORGEOUS. She twirls her hair incessantly with slender painted fingertips. 
A seventh desk sits well apart from the others back beneath the windows. 
The girls all stare up at Precious blankly as she enters the room. Precious looks to be in a mild state of shock as she gazes around from the girls to Ms. Rain to the clouds outside the windows. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) First thing I wonder is where is everybody -the boyz, the noises ...this feel like a Sunday school or crazy house...or something like bof' but different. Smell different too. 
Precious' eyes land on the lone desk in the rear of the room. 
MS. RAIN (O.S.) Have a seat. 
Precious looks from the distant desk to one up front and then back to the distant desk. 
She sits with the other girls delicately, as if she were a visitor in a complete stranger's home. 
(CONTINUED) 
50   CONTINUED:                                                50 Ms. Rain finishes marking the roll sheet, places the cap on her pen and holds up a notebook identical to the one Precious left at the Kickin Fried Chicken. 
MS. RAIN Does everyone have her notebook? 
Precious sucks her teeth in self-disgust as she looks around to find that all the other girls have theirs. 
JO ANN ROGERS -CAREFREE, CUTE AND SMUG, then breezes into the room with an air of insubordination. 
MS. RAIN It's 9:07. Jo Ann you're late. 
Jo Ann points into her mouth, which is full. 
JO ANN (chewing) I had to. Most important meal of the... 
MS. RAIN Starting tomorrow, this door will be locked at 9:00. 
Jo Ann rolls her eyes and sits beside Precious. 
MS. RAIN Class, today we have some new people so let's just... 
JO ANN Ooh! Hold up! wait up! Hold up! I found something! 
MS. RAIN I beg your pardon Jo Ann! 
JO ANN 2000 'pologies Miz Rain but I jus' want to say, do anyone need an extra notebook I foun' in the chicken place? 
PRECIOUS It's mine! 
JO ANN Okay hoe. I found your Cadillac too. It's parked out front.

50   CONTINUED: (2)                                            50 Jo Ann rolls her eyes. 
PRECIOUS I leff it! I did! I leff it at the Kickin Fried Chicken on Lenox tween one-two-seven and one-two-six this morning. 
JO ANN ...Alright girl, I was just fuckin' with you. 
Jo Ann returns the notebook to Precious. 
MS. RAIN Mind your mouth in here Jo Ann. 
JO ANN What I say?! 
MS. RAIN Just watch the language. 
Jo Ann shrugs her shoulders, looks down and then turns her eyes to Precious' stomach. 
JO ANN (quietly) When you due? 
Precious looks down and shrugs her shoulders. 
PRECIOUS What do you want me to say? 
MS. WEISS Whatever comes to mind when you think about your home. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Seem like inquiring white bitches always want to know. 
PRECIOUS I wish I had a TV in my room. 
MS. WEISS (beat) Is that all? 
PRECIOUS No... My muver is a like a whale person for the couch. She says I eat alla time, but then she always makin' me eat... and then call me a fat mess.... She says apartment is little because of me.

MS. WEISS Of course. I want to learn more about your father anyway. 
PRECIOUS I don't know much more than you do Miz White...

59   INT. 444 LENOX AVE. APT. - DAY                               59 
TOOSIE, A WOMAN IN HER LATE 50'S RADIATING A TOUGHNESS OF PRIOR GENERATIONS, enters the apartment in a business-like manner with MONGO, A SMALL, DISTRACTED AND OBVIOUSLY HANDICAPPED CHILD. Toosie has a bag of groceries in her other arm. 
Precious watches TV beside her mother. Both appear as if they've just woken up. Mary attempts to put on her wig and make up. 
Toosie gives Mongo to Mary, whose eyes never leave the television, and then hands the groceries to Precious, who takes them directly to the kitchen as Toosie leaves without a word. 
PRECIOUS (O.S.) Mongo? 
MS. WEISS (O.S.) Excuse me? 
PRECIOUS (O.S.) Mongo? Thas short for Mongoloid. She got Down Sinder. 
MS. WEISS (O.S.) You mean she has Down Syndrome? 
PRECIOUS (O.S.) Alla dat. 
The child seems only mildly aware of what is going on. 
The DOORBELL rings again. Precious opens the door. A HISPANIC WOMAN IN HER THIRTIES with an attache case enters. 
As the woman steps inside, we see that Mary has finished tidying herself. 
Mary and the woman exchange small talk while Precious listens. Mary has never seemed so congenial. 
PRECIOUS (O.S.) My grandmuver Toosie, brangs Little Mongo over on days social worker come so it look like Mongo live wif us. Then my mama get the check 'n food stamps for me 'n Little Mongo. But it's my baby. Little Mongo is money for me, not her! 
60   INT. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                       60 
Precious continues speaking to Ms. Weiss from the couch. 
PRECIOUS ...Sometimes I see vampires too. They come for me sometimes and they say that I am one of them. They say, "Precious, you belong wif us." 
MS. WEISS How do you respond to them? 
PRECIOUS I say, "Check wif my muver." After that, they just look at me and go down through the floor. The family downstairs is vampires so that's where they should go. 
Ms. Weiss looks up from her clipboard and over her glasses. 
Precious reflects a moment and then looks up. 
PRECIOUS I'm going to the doctor now too. It's nice. Miz Rain, she fall out when she finded out that I ain' been to no doctor. Whole class scream 'preenatal' at me. They don't know I had my first baby on the kitchen floor wif my muver kicking me upside my head. I mean, who would believe? 
Precious snickers reminiscently a moment and then turns to Ms. Weiss. 
PRECIOUS Them the kind of thangs you mean when you say talk about whatever come into my mind? 
Ms. Weiss looks up and nods through a perplexed daze. 
We close in on Precious writing as we hear her whisper the following. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Listen Baby, Muver love you. Muver not dumb. Listen: 
PRECIOUS (CONT'D)             PRECIOUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) (in a whisper)                 Thas the alphabet. Twenty-six ABCDEFGHIJKLPMN                   letters in all. Them letters O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z.          make up words. Them words everything. 
Precious looks up from her page gazing in an otherworldly way. 
One by one, the other girls stop what they're doing and stare at Precious curiously. 
Their eyes turn downward in unison. 
CLOSE ON Precious' legs. 
A gush of water pours down between them as if it were a tidal wave. 
67   INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                          67 
SILENT MONTAGE 
...The wheels of a speeding gurney waggle to remain straight. 
...Fluorescent lights stream by overhead. 
...Name tags dangle from the chests of attendants pushing the gurney. 
One we see belongs to a handsome African American Male nurse, JOHN MCFADDEN. He is constantly looking down with a reassuring smile. 
...Covered in sweat, Precious screams without our hearing a sound. 
68   EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                          68

PRECIOUS (V.O.) His name Abdul Jamal Louis Jones. He healthy. His muver love him. 
John, the nurse who helped gurney Precious in, again stares down warmly at her. This time with Abdul in her arms. 
69A   INT. HOSPITAL BEDROOM - NIGHT                             69A 
Precious sleeps peacefully. It is still raining outside. Ms. Rain crochets in the corner. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN 
70    INT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                        70 
We are close on Precious. Her eyes focus intently and occasionally dart up and down. 
Nurse John is doing the same thing. 
His hands lay on top of Precious' with their palms touching. 
We glimpse both of their searching eyes again. 
Suddenly, Precious whips her hands over and SLAPS the back of John's before he can pull them away. 
PRECIOUS I win. 
JOHN That hurt girl. 
PRECIOUS Get to X-Ray. 
JOHN (leaving) Maybe I will. 
PRECIOUS You gon have to if you don't practice. 
JOHN Alright. 
(CONTINUED)

The girls from class ogle him from another part of the room as he leaves and then nudge and bicker with each other for pole position to hold Abdul. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Dear Miz Rain, All the years I sit in class I never learn, but now I got baby again by my fahver. 
Behind the girls, Precious sits up in bed writing in her journal. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) I wish I had a boyfriend like other girls and then I'd feel right that I have to quit school. I love my baby but want school too. 
Precious closes her book. Jo Ann backs away from the others, takes the notebook and then leaves. 
Rhonda returns Abdul to Precious. The remaining girls embrace Precious one at a time and then file out of the room. 
71   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY                                         71 
Precious rides holding Abdul. 
MS. RAIN (V.O.) You could go further than your mother. You could get your G.E.D. and go to college. You could do anything Precious but you have to believe it. Love, Blu Rain. 
82    EXT. 444 LENOX AVE. - DAY                                 82

84   INT. 444 LENOX AVE. STAIRWELL - DAY                          84 
Precious climbs the stairs growing short of breath holding Abdul, her bags and her coat folded over one arm. 
Once on the landing, she searches for her keys while trying to balance Abdul and everything else. 
After turning several locks, she pushes into the apartment... 
85   INT. 444 LENOX AVE. - CONTINUOUS                             85 
...looks up and ducks. 
MARY Bitch!!! 
CRASH!!! A flying vase barely misses Precious and Abdul and then shatters against the wall. 
Abdul WAILS. 
PRECIOUS MAMA! ! ! 
SMASH! A plant comes next. 
Precious barely dodges that one too and she drops everything but Abdul. 
PRECIOUS MAMA! ! ! 
MARY (O.S.) YOU RUIN MY LIFE YOU FAT LITTLE SLUT!!! 
Mary charges into frame to ram Precious and Abdul like a bull. 
Precious sidesteps the charge as Mary leaves a huge indentation in the wall knocking over a side table and a potted plant in the process. She grabs her shoulder in pain. 
Precious backs away around the living room to flee. 
Mary hurls what's left of the plant at Precious from down on the floor.

85   CONTINUED:                                                 85 Precious turns her back to shield Abdul. The pot strikes her in the back. ABDUL SCREAMS louder. Dirt covers Precious. 
PRECIOUS STOP IT MAMA! YOU GON CRAZY?!!! 
As Mary gets to her feet ... 
MARY FIRST YOU STEAL MY HUSBAND, THEN YOU GET ME CUT OFF THE WELFARE YOU STUPID-MOUTH BITCH!

Tears well in Precious' eyes. 
PRECIOUS SHUT UP MOMMA! I NOT STUPID! I AM NOT STUPID! DON'T SAY THAT! 
Mary GROWLS and charges Precious again. 
Precious turns the TV over between them. Electrical sparks fly as it hits the floor. There is a banging at the door. 
NEIGHBOR (O.S.) Mary, leave that chile alone. Stop beating that girl Mary. 
Mary trips and crashes down on top of the overturned television. 
Precious dashes out of the apartment with only Abdul as Mary struggles to get up. 
MARY I'M GON KILL YOU PIG! 
PRECIOUS I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DIDN'T ALREADY. YOU CRAZY BITCH!

The girls nod and leave.

MS. RAIN Before this day is up, you will have a place to live Precious. 
Ms. Rain suspends her frustration with a brief smile as she waits for the other end of the line to pick up. 
104   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY                                     104 
Jo Ann saunters in. 
The other girls are writing already. 
Rhonda is at the head of the class displaying unusually good posture. 
RHONDA (looking at her watch) Jo Ann, you late. 
JO ANN You ain't the teacher. 
RHONDA I am today. Miz Rain busy wif Precious. 
JO ANN (thrilled) Alright!!! (concerned) How Precious? 
105   INT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY                                  105 
Ms. Rain hangs up the phone. 
She looks tired. 
PRECIOUS They have ...something. It's an immediate opening and it's in Queens. 
Precious looks concerned. 
PRECIOUS Queens? 
MS. RAIN Yeah. Queens ...What do you think? 
PRECIOUS (beat) I don't really know Queens. 
MS. RAIN Me either. You should stay in Harlem...long as we can anyway.

106   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                       106 
Precious exits the girls bathroom carrying Abdul. She sports a new sweat suit. 
She pauses before entering Each One Teach One Reception Area and observes Ms. Rain speaking on the phone for a moment. Suzanne, the school's administrator stands by. 
MS. RAIN ...C-L-A-I-R-E-E ... 
WOMAN'S VOICE Hey Precious. 
Precious jumps and turns around to find Cornrows passing by. 
PRECIOUS Hi Miss Lisa. 
CORNROWS (still moving) How you been? 
PRECIOUS Good. How you been? 
CORNROWS I don't know... I went to see that movie Barfly last night... That piece of shit was depressin...Cute kid. 
Precious still looks confused.

The ladies lounge around the living room. Ms. Rain and Katherine hold glasses of wine. Precious still looks as if she's trying to keep up. 
KATHERINE ...Ask yourself. Just ask yourself; if Ronald McDonald were running the show and the price of hamburgers skyrocketed, wouldn't you be suspicious? 
MS. RAIN I just think you should finish the book. 
KATHERINE Who's gonna read it? 
MS. RAIN Nobody if you don't write it. Precious writes everyday. You should try it. 
KATHERINE What do you write about Precious? 
PRECIOUS I don't know. Stuff in my life. Abdul.

110   CONTINUED:                                                  110 (beat) How come y'all don't like McDonalds? 
MS. RAIN Katherine was just drawing a comparison so that her point could be more easily understood... 
PRECIOUS (V.O.)                        MS. RAIN Together, these homo ladies        It's called an analogy. For talk like TV channels I don't      example, my uncle Clayton watch. I'm glad Abdul here to      used to smoke like a chimney listen in on 'em tho cause I       and drink like a fish before know they smart.                   he got saved. 
An Etta James tune begins ... 
CUT TO: 
Ms. Rain and Katherine, high from the wine, spin each other lazily in a playful dance. 
Precious sits watching carefully. She lifts and smells the gardenias from the table. 
Precious starts to pour a bottle of wine into her glass. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Mama say homos is bad peoples ... 
A hand intercepts the bottle. It is Ms. Rain's. She then pours it into her own glass and takes the bottle with her as she returns to Katherine. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) ...But homos not who rape me, homos not who let me sit up in school 16 years and learn nuffin and homos not sell crack to peoples in Harlem. I wonder what Oprah have to say about that? 
Ms. Rain looks over to Precious.

112    INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY                          112 
Streamers hang from the walls. Various handwritten versions of "Congratulations Precious", obviously written by the girls, stretch across the blackboard in uneven-sized letters. Precious stands beside Ms. Rain holding a small trophy and a check. The other girls flank them standing very straight. All wear big grins. 
FLASHPWOOWF! 
Nurse John, without his uniform, has just taken a picture of everyone. 
The girls go straight for the cookies and punch waiting atop an orange tablecloth on Ms. Rain's desk. They begin a Soul Train Line and dance around the desk as Nurse John approaches Ms. Rain to converse. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) After I settle in halfway house, I work my hardest to memorize letter sounds, write in journal and read smaller and fatter books. Then I find out Mayor's office give me Literacy Award and check for progress. Everybody at the party, Nurse John, Cornrows and the staff stop in too, but they need to get back to they desks before too long. Whole operation can't stop just cause Miss Precious get a trophy. Even Ms. Katherine shows. 
John discreetly beckons Precious over to the side as she blows into a noisemaker. Both she and John dance in high spirits.

It is a leather bound journal with blank pages. Precious flips through it. 
PRECIOUS You talk to us girls in the class when we be working out problems and thangs and stuff, right? 
Ms. Rain speaks to Precious while picking up around the room. 
MS. RAIN Mm hm... 
PRECIOUS Well, who do you talk to? 
Caught off guard, Ms. Rain looks at Precious curiously. 
PRECIOUS (quickly) Or you probably don't have no problems so... 
MS. RAIN Everybody has those Precious.

PRECIOUS (sitting) Me? I never... 
Precious stops as Ms. Rain looks away as if gathering her thoughts. 
Finally... 
MS. RAIN Last night I had a conversation with my mother, and that never happens cause our relationship is.... complicated. We don't speak, and when we do, it always ends in a fight about my filthy misguided existence. Most times I feel terrible for days afterwards wondering whether all the hateful things she said are true. Those days I just feel like...like... 
PRECIOUS Nuffin? 
MS. RAIN ...Yeah. I didn't feel so bad this time though. (beat) Cause this time I thought about how strong you've had to be and then I decided that I had nothing to be ashamed of and that my mother was wrong about me, my dad and 5 or 6 hundred other things. You ask if you can help me? Baby, you already have. 
PRECIOUS ...For real? 
MS. RAIN That's the for real, hope to die if I'm lying truth. Now shouldn't you be out the door?

Ms. Rain motions to the other end of a long folding table. Precious takes hold of it and they carry it across the room together. 
As we watch from a distance... 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Some folks got a light around them that shine for other peoples. I think maybe some of them was in a long tunnel before. And in that tunnel, maybe the only light they had was one that was inside of them and then -even long after they escaped that tunnel, they still be shining for everybody else. Thas Miz Rain to me. 
115   INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE: PRECIOUS' ROOM - DAY                115 
Precious' trophy sits on the windowsill beneath a thin a layer of dust. 
A stack of books sit on her bureau. 
Colorful letters and numbers hang on the wall. Beneath them hang postcards featuring Zora Neal Hurston, Alice Walker, Maya Angelou and Oprah Winfrey. 
Abdul sleeps in his crib. 
Precious makes her bed. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) In a book I read, a lady escaped to a 1/2 way house. And the lady, she asked the people there just what a 1/2 way house was. They tole her, you is 1/2 way between the life you had and the life you want to have ...Thas nice. That also mean I can't stay here forever and that there is still a ways to go. It be something to get apartment of my own. 
116    EXT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE PARK GROUNDS - DAY                116 
A larger Abdul steps towards us with Precious behind him wearing a cotton dress that looks vaguely like one Ms. Rain might wear. 
MARY We never did what you got to do to get it. 
PRECIOUS He never been wif you? 
MARY Yeah...but not like faggots, in the ass and all, so I know. 
Precious is speechless. It looks as if some of her anger has suddenly been displaced with pity.

Mary looks up delicately. 
MARY You welcome back home. 
PRECIOUS I'm home here. (beat) I better go see 'bout Abdul and do homework. 
Mary doesn't move as Precious leaves. 
Mary sits staring at the floor at the far side of the room. 
121   INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE: PRECIOUS' ROOM - DAY                121 
Precious enters, takes Abdul from his crib, holds him closely and sits on her bed. 
Moments later, a TAPPING on the window draws her attention. 
Precious rises to find Tom Cruise hurling pebbles up at her window in a leather jacket. 
A MOTORCYCLE sits a few feet away from him. 
He beckons her. 
She stares down at him with solemn eyes. 
Tom finally mounts his bike and vanishes into thin air while revving its engine. 
Mary then crosses the frame where he was. 
Precious turns to Abdul and kisses him on the head.

122   EXT. STREET - DAY                                           122 
Precious walks over the crest of a hill deep in thought with her hands in her pockets. The constant HUM of the city seems lower than usual as Precious' FOOTSTEPS make the most prominent sound.

123   INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY                         123 
Ms. Rain stands before the blackboard with a piece of chalk in her hand pointing to the word "unrelenting", which is written behind her. 
Consuelo is missing and TWO NEW GIRLS, AISHA, INDIAN AND FROM GUYANA AND BUNNY, VERY THIN WITH BAD TEETH have joined the class. 
MS. RAIN Rita, what do I mean when the author describes her protagonist's circumstances as "unrelenting"? 
RITA I don't know Miz Rain. 
MS. RAIN C'mon Rita, think about the question before you just give up like that... 
Ms. Rain's voice trails off as we find Precious lost in thought. 
124   INT. CLINIC - DAY                                          124 
Precious waits in a small gray office. 
A FEMALE COUNSELOR WITH SYMPATHETIC EYES carrying a file sits across from her. 
Her eyes say everything. 
The counselor places a hand on top of Precious'. 
125   INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY                         125

MS. RAIN Because you love her...as much as she loves you. 
Precious looks to her side and finds Rita smiling reassuringly through her crooked teeth. 
MS. RAIN Now the rest of the world can judge you, cheat you, beat you, dismiss you and abandon you all it wants but we won't let you give up and that's the only thing that matters. Some people have less than that on their side and still manage to keep going. (beat) It's up to you. 
Precious thinks a long moment, wipes her face and exhales. She doesn't move for what seems like ages. 
The whole class watches her until Ms. Rain motions for them to continue working. Finally, Precious takes hold of her pen, opens her journal, sighs deeply and starts to write again. 
126   EXT. PARK - DAY                                           126 
Our young ladies and Ms. Rain are seated around a picnic table eating, laughing, talking and writing in their journals all at the same time. Precious has found friends. 
As we watch Rhonda ...

127   INT. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                   127 
Ms. Weiss speaks from behind her desk as Precious sits on the couch beside her backpack looking bored. 
MS. WEISS ...You know you can use your notebook between sessions Claireece. 
PRECIOUS I do. 
MS. WEISS I mean you can use it specifically for trying to recover certain early memories. 
Precious nods mechanically. 
(CONTINUED) 
127   CONTINUED:                                               127 PRECIOUS (V.O.) Tired of this lady asking me questions. Miz Rain say talk anyway but Miz Weiss just a spy for the State who write reports on me undercover. Reports go in file. File say what I could get, where I could go and if I could get cut off and kicked out of Advancement House. 
MS. WEISS (beat) What are you thinking? 
PRECIOUS Nothing. 
MS. WEISS Oh I doubt that Claireece. It seems like you're always thinking about something. 
PRECIOUS I don't know. It's sort of hot in here I guess. 
MS. WEISS It is, isn't it? As a matter of fact, I'm going to get myself something to drink. Would you like something to drink Claireece? 
PRECIOUS A soda sounds nice ...please. 
MS. WEISS What kind? 
PRECIOUS I don't care. 
MS. WEISS Oh c'mon, you must. 
PRECIOUS Orange. 
MS. WEISS Okee Dokee. 
Ms. Weiss collects some change, grins at Precious and then steps out of the room leaving her purse open on the desk. 
(CONTINUED) 
127   CONTINUED: (2)                                             127 MS. WEISS Back in a jiffy. 
The moment the door closes, Precious dashes across the room for the file cabinet behind Ms. Weiss' desk. 
Precious searches the drawers in the cabinet and rifles through the files. 
128   EXT. HALLWAY - DAY                                          128 
Ms. Weiss inserts several pieces of change into a vending machine and presses a button. A can of Soda CLUNKS down through the bowels of the machine. 
129   OFFICE                                                      129

133   INT. ADVANCEMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - DAY                       133 
Precious hurries into a room carrying Abdul. The sign on the door says "DAYCARE". 
Precious dashes out of the room alone. 
WOMAN'S (0.S.) And don't be coming back late for his bad ass neither. 
134   EXT STREET - DAY                                           134 
Precious marches to school with her bookbag and red scarf. She clearly has a lot on her mind. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Miz Weiss just part of the gang but definitely not cool. And social worker look at me like I am ugly freak who did something to make my own life like it is. I guess I am trying to figure out just what has happened to me while Miz Weiss just hell bent on making me go wipe old people's asses. 
Precious crosses the street. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Got to sort dis out quick tho 'fore Abdul's next birthday -coming up fast. 
135   INT. HOTEL THERESA CLASSROOM - DAY                         135 
The whole class writes until Ms. Rain looks at her watch and... 
(CONTINUED) 
135   CONTINUED:                                               135 MS. RAIN Time is up. Does anyone want to share? 
The only hand up belongs to Precious'. 
MS. RAIN Okay Precious. 
PRECIOUS I don't really want to read all I wrote, I jus' wanna kinda say what it is I'm writing about and how it came about. 
AISHA What happened? 
PRECIOUS Well, to make a long story short, the counselor at Advancement House quizzing me about Mama and Daddy etc., etc. But it's really about workfare. She want to send me out as home attendant. 
RHONDA How you know? 
PRECIOUS Cause I stole my file from Advancement House and read it. 
The class GASPS. 
JO ANN Next time get mine's too. 
PRECIOUS All this 'What you wanna be?' And 'You can talk to me.' They ain' no motherfucking therapists on our side, they just flunkies for the 'fare. I wanna work, but not for no motherfucking welfare check in Central Park -displacing brothers and sisters who really got jobs cleaning up 'cause I'm there working for free. 
Jermaine speaks while slouched in her chair with her feet crossed and arms folded. 
(CONTINUED) 
135   CONTINUED: (2)                                         135 JERMAINE And what kinda shit is it for someone like Precious to have quit school before she get her G.E.D. to work at some live-in job for some old-ass crackers. She'll never make a rise she get stuck in some shit like that! 
MS. RAIN Sit up straight Jermaine and watch your language. Both of you. Please. 
Jermaine reluctantly sits up. 
MS. RAIN Now I see your points, but is stealing... 
PRECIOUS Miz Rain, If I didn't steal that file I wouldn't know what I was facing! 
MS. RAIN You read the whole thing by yourself? 
PRECIOUS Yeah...basically. 
JO ANN Rhonda home attend. Say old bitch would ring a bell when she want Rhonda in the night! 
JERMAINE Rhonda used to have to go all the way out to Brighton Beach where she work for them people. 
PRECIOUS The people had her there all day and night - 'on call' they call it. But you only get pay for 8 hours so that's 8 X $6.37 (referring to her notebook) = $50.96 a day, but then you is not really getting that much cause you is working more than eight hours a day. You is working 24 hours a day and 50.96 divided by 24 is... 
(CONTINUED) 
135   CONTINUED: (3)                                         135 (referring to her notebook) $2.12 by my count. 
JO ANN Rhonda say old bitch would ring a bell - a actual bell -when she want Rhonda in the night! 
PRECIOUS Home attendants usually work six days a week. I would only see Abdul on Sundays? When would I go to school? (beat) Am I gonna hafta go be home attendant like Rhonda was? 
MS. RAIN No! So stop worrying about it. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. Trust me -no, trust yourself. My concern now is that if this Ms. Weiss is someone you're working with and can't trust, she's out! We gotta find somebody else. 
PRECIOUS (beat) Well, I just write in my notebook till I get wif some kinda therapist I can trust. Actually that always help me more than talking to her. Plus, I'm going to start going to meetings wif Rita for insect survivors. 
140    CONTINUED:                                                    140 RITA (to Precious) Do you want another hot chocolate? 
Precious smiles and shakes her head no. Rita gets up. Precious watches her go as Miriam and Lisa chat. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) Rita ask me do I want another hot chocolate. I do but I don't want to be greedy, even if her boyfriend do give her money. 
Precious looks around at all of the other girls. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) I'm alive inside. A bird is my heart. Mama and Daddy didn't win. I'm winning. I'm drinking hot chocolate on the Upper West Side with girls - all kind who love me. How does a stranger meet me and love me? 
Rita returns with two cups of hot chocolate.       She gives one to Precious. 
Precious thanks Rita with her eyes. 
FADE OUT 
FADE IN 
R141   EXT. MRS. WEISS'S WAITING AREA - DAY                         R141 
Precious, wearing her new scarf and glasses, sits in the waiting room holding a book in her hands. Abdul plays among the little children in the kids area behind her. Crumpled wrapping paper lays beside her. The book's first page reads: 
CONGRATULATIONS PRECIOUS! I'M SO PROUD OF YOU YET AGAIN. 
LOVE, MS. RAIN 
Sheila and Ruby walk in and sit down beside Precious. Ruby has a black eye. They sit in silence for a few moments, waiting for their turn. 
SECRETARY (O.S.) Sheila Hewitt, Ms. Rubenstein is ready for you. 
(CONTINUED) 
107A. R141   CONTINUED:                                              R141 SHEILA (To Ruby) Go on back there! 
RUBY But there are no kids there I can play with. 
SHEILA Do you want me to knock your other eye out! Just sit there and shut up then! I'm going to talk to this lady before my shit gets cut off! 
Sheila heads up the stairs toward the offices. Precious closes her book. Its cover reads: Chrystal Stair: Selected Works by Langston Hughes. 
SECRETARY (O.S.) Clareece Precious Jones!   Mrs. Weiss is ready for you. 
Precious stands up and looks down at Ruby, sulking in her chair. She leans down, gives her a big hug and tenderly fixes Ruby's hair. 
Precious walks off toward the stairs, but stops when she passes a mirror hanging on the wall. Within the reflection, she sees her true self for the first time. 
(CONTINUED) 
R141   CONTINUED: (2)                                        R141 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) One day Miz Rain ask us to write about our ideal self...I wrote that I would be light skinned and small wif wavy swing-job hair. 
She heads up the stairs toward the offices. 
PRECIOUS (V.O.) (beat) Miz Rain read all that and then say I am beautiful like I am. I never believe her before but somehow, today, this moment -can't say why, I do. Just now...The inside I thought was so beautiful is a black girl too. 
(CONTINUED) 
R141   CONTINUED: (3)                                          R141 Precious turns around to find that Ruby has grabbed her arm. She then reaches up and hugs Precious tightly. 
Through the embrace, Precious finds herself facing the many mirrors on display by the old man on the folding chair. In her reflections, she sees the skinny white girl who she has frequently imagined herself as gradually transform into the real Precious one by one. 
142    EXT. STREET - DAY                                        142 
We tilt down upon a stately pre-war building bathed in stark wintry light. 
MS. WEISS (O.S.) Perhaps we should begin by talking a little bit about the abuse. 
143    INT. CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                   143 
Mary looks worse than ever. Her hair and clothing are disastrous. She rocks somewhat anxiously on the edge of her seat like a desperate salesman looking to close a deal. 
MARY 'Buse? 
MS. WEISS Yes Ms. Johnston. Abuse. 
MARY There was no drugs in ma house! No drugs! 'Cause Precious know damn well I whoop her ass bright blue if she bring some drugs in ma... 
MS. WEISS I'm referring to inappropriate acts of a physical and sexual nature involving Precious. 
MARY Why'nt you say dat? Dat?! Okay. When it first start? 
MS. WEISS Yes. According to Precious' files she has had two children by your boyfriend, the late Carl Kenwood Jones, who is also her father? 
(CONTINUED) 
143   CONTINUED:                                               143 You've been calling here saying you want to be reunited with your daughter and grandson and that you want them to come home. Well I think you'd better explain just what happened in that home. 
Precious waits nervously. 
MARY ...Well, I, Precious b'long at home cause I'm a good mother. She had everything. I done tole her that. Pink 'n white baby carriage, little pink bootie socks, dresses; everything I put on her pink. Precious, she so smiling and healthy. A day don't go by I don't throw her wheeling in the air. I take her up and down 125th Street. Me 'n Carl loved Precious. I dreamed of the day we was gonna you know, git married, git house wif grass, color TV's in all the rooms. Precious, She born about the same time as Miz West son that got kilt. You remember him don't you Precious?

THE CROODS

SEQ. 75 - PROLOGUE 
FADE IN: 
A cave painting of the Dreamworks logo. Push past the moon to the sun. Bright. Beautiful. The sun DISSOLVES TO: 
Cave paintings of a family of cavemen -- we will come to know them as The Croods. 
EEP (V.O.) With every sun comes a new day. A new beginning. A hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday. 
The Croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for food. Scared. Fast. 
The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks. 
EEP (V.O.) But not for me. My name's Eep. This, is my family, the Croods. If you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads - we're cavemen. Most days we spend in our cave, in the dark. Night after night, day after day. Yep. Home sweet home. When we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world. And I struggled to survive my family. 
The Croods are chased by beasts across the desert. They escape from creatures up trees. They hide behind rocks. 
EEP (V.O.) We were the last ones around. There used to be neighbors. The Gorts, smashed by a mammoth. The Horks, swallowed by a sand snake. The Erfs, mosquito bite. Throgs, common cold. And, the Croods. That's us. The Croods made it... 
Grug protects his family from a GIANT BEAR OWL. 
EEP (V.O.) Because of my Dad. He was strong... and he followed the rules. 
A shadow falls across their feet and Grug ushers his family home. 
EEP (V.O.) ... the ones painted on the cave walls. Anything new is bad, curiosity is bad, going out at night is bad. Basically, anything fun is bad. Welcome to my world. 
They all run back into the cave where Grug slams the rock door closed. 
SLOWLY LIGHT ON CAVE PAINTINGS COMES UP AGAIN. But this time the light casts an ominous tone. 
EEP (V.O.) But this is a story about how all that changed in an instant. 
RAPID SHOTS OF THE GREAT SPLIT CUTTING THROUGH THE LAND. HEADED TOWARDS CROOD VALLEY. 
SHOTS OF CATACLYSM. CUT FASTER AND FASTER UNTIL... 
EEP (V.O.) Because what we didn't know, was that our world was about to come to an end. And there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that. 
CAVEMAN HANDS PRESS against the rock wall. They PUSH. A BLINDING LIGHT FLOODS the screen. 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 100 - MEET THE CROODS A HUGE CAVEMAN, GRUG, RUSHES forward, screaming, growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a THREAT DISPLAY. He BLINKS in the bright morning light. He LIFTS and HURLS a large boulder. 
GRUG Raaaaar grooooOOOOoooowwwll ERF ERF Glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh! 
As suddenly as he began, Grug stops. Panting, he waits for the echoes of his outburst to fade. 
Grug TURNS to the cave entrance, he prepares to BELLOW a signal, but before any sound escapes his lips-- 
A CAVE GIRL, EEP, bursts from the cave. 
GRUG (CONT'D) You're supposed to wait for my signal Eep. Eep? 
Eep scares a pack of nearby Liyotes away. They pounce on Grug briefly before scampering off. Eep spreads out on an overhanging rock. She BASKS IN THE SUN. 
EEP We've been in that cave forever. 
GRUG Three days is not forever. 
EEP It is with this family. 
GRUG Eep would you come down here? You're being so dramatic. 
EEP Heads. 
Gran FACE-PLANTS, her head buried in the sand. Only her tail is showing. 
GRUG Tails. Thunk's in. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Positions. 
The family fades back and splits up. They get into fighting/running position. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Ok. Thunk. Go. Come on Thunk. 
Thunk BREAKS COVER. He dashes into the open, SNATCHES the egg. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Hah! Way to go. Take it to the cave! 
Thunk PASSES Grug and makes a bee-line for Crood Canyon. 
A Gerf bird smashes Thunk and steals the egg back. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Oooh! 
GRUG (CONT'D) Release the baby. 
Eep and Sandy MOVE IN on the bird. Sandy NIPS at its heels while UGGA CLIMBS up onto its head. She PULLS the egg from its beak. 
Down range, TRIP GERBILS SURFACE. They STRETCH their shared tail across the Ramu's path like an arresting cable on a carrier. 
Ugga RISES to THROW the egg to Grug - the gerbils WRAP their tail around the Ramu like a bola. The Ramu GOES DOWN hard. Ugga and the egg ROLL forward. The Trip Gerbils SNATCH up the egg and make off with it. 
UGGA Get um Mom! Do it for the Croods! 
Gran's cane HOOKS the gerbils in the middle of their tail and WHIPS them up and over her shoulder. 
ON GRAN 
DRIBBLING the egg down-range with her cane like a hockey player. LIYOTES POP UP from behind hoodoos. They SWARM in behind her. 
The Liyotes TRIP Gran. They steal the egg, and HIT THE GAS. They are INCREDIBLY FAST. 
GRAN Old lady down! Eep, avenge me. 
ON EEP 
Crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on the blocks - she has the Liyotes in her sights. Eep LAUNCHES. 
Eep runs after the Liyote with the egg, cutting him off in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg into the air. Eep leaps into the air taking back the egg. 
EEP Thanks! 
A bunch of Jackrobats see Eep and swarm around her. She loses her footing and throws the egg to Grug. 
GRUG Eep! 
EEP Heads Up! 
Grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small cave. Thunk following close behind accidentally trips over the tail of a sleeping Bear Owl knocking Grug to the ground and fumbling the egg once again. 
Thunk catches the egg just as the Girelephant bears down on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks. The family members meet up as they begin their long run back to the cave. 
An entire swarm of animals chase the Croods as they head back to their cave. 
The Bear Owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the chase. 
Grug protecting his family from the BearOwl tosses each family member onto the Girelephant's back. 
Grug dodges the BearOwl's attack and uses him as a launching pad to get himself safely on the Girelephant. 
Thunk is happy to see Dad is safe. 
THUNK Oh hey Dad, can we eat now? 
GRUG How can she not like the cave? It's so cozy. 
UGGA It is a little, dark, Grug. 
GRUG It's not that dark. 
Grug is finished with his bath. 
GRUG (CONT'D) (LOSING PATIENCE) Eep! Eep? 
Eep begins to climb down the wall outside when she hears a sound in the distance. Curious, she begins to climb even higher. Grug leaves the cave, searching for her. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Come on, I gotta close the cave... 
ON GRUG exiting the cave... Grug sees that Eep is at the very top. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Eep! 
Eep continues to climb. EEP Okay, okay! 
GRUG Come on. 
Behind Grug, the Bear Owl appears up the canyon. It SPOTS Grug and the open cave and RACES to attack. Grug sees the BearOwl in full attack mode. 
GRUG (CONT'D) EEP! COME DOWN!! 
Grug throws a rock which momentarily stuns the creature, allowing Eep to JUMP DOWN and DART into the cave. Grug barely gets the cave closed in time. 
GRUG (CONT'D) SIGH 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 210 - BEDTIME STORY 
The Bear Owl PUSHES his paw through the narrow opening, and FEELS around for the Croods. The Croods are like mice in this world. 
GRUG That was too close! 
EEP I was watching. I was fine. 
GRUG What were you doing up there, Eep? 
EEP I don't know. 
GRUG What were you looking for? 
EEP Nothing. 
GRUG Well then why did you go up there? 
EEP (ANNOYED) I don't know. GRUG Why don't you know? Stop looking for things. Fear keeps us alive Eep. Never not be afraid. 
Eep climbs up on a ledge and curls up in the corner where a tiny spot of light seeps in. 
EEP (TO HERSELF) What's the point of all this? 
GRUG Hmmm? What was that? 
EEP (a little louder) I mean, why are we here? What are we doing this for? 
CROODS GROAN 
GRUG No one said survival was fun. 
EEP Nothing is fun. 
GRUG Hmm? Would you come down here. Eep? 
No answer. Grug CLIMBS up. Ugga PULLS Grug back down. 
UGGA Grug. Off. 
The Croods sleep peacefully in their pile. Except Eep, who tosses restlessly on her LEDGE. Outside, we hear the ROARS and HOWLS of prehistoric creatures fighting. 
But then, SILENCE. 
And then cutting through the primordial night is a MUSICAL SOUND. Unsettling. Unearthly. Eep creeps around her sleeping family and cautiously approaches the "door" to peer outside, when suddenly-- 
WHOOSH! A bright light blazes through the gaps around the boulder door, bathing Eep in an OTHER-WORLDLY GLOW. She chases the flash of light around the cave trying to catch it in her hands. 
Eep presses her face against the cold boulder, trying to get a look at what is outside, but she can't get more than a blurred glimpse of the canyon beyond - and the disappearing light. 
Desperate to see more, Eep braces her back against the cave and PUSHES the plug rock with her legs. Slowly, she shifts the rock, careful not to wake her father. It takes all of her strength, but she manages to move it just enough for her to BARELY SQUEEZE out. 
EXT. CROOD CANYON - CONTINUOUS 
Eep stands outside at night for the first time ever. Her heart races. The hot night wind blows against her face and through her hair. The forbidden sensation is exhilarating. The canyon beyond is quickly swallowing the light - it will be gone in another few seconds. With one of her hands pressed tightly to the cave `door', she steels herself. 
Eep LETS GO and DASHES after the light, SCRAMBLING through the SANDSTONE NARROWS, bounding from side to side. As she disappears into the darkness of the canyon, we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CANYON 
The light ahead is growing brighter. Eep is closing on it. In her excitement, she missteps and SNAPS a stick underfoot. 
It was barely audible. Eep instinctively FREEZES. 
A huge SHADOW of a TUSKED CREATURE is cast on the wall above her. Eep throws a rock at the shadow. 
She POWERS STRAIGHT UP the stone wall with unexpected speed. 
The Creature RUNS. Eep tops the wall and... 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 550 - CLOSE ENCOUNTERS 
EXT. ROCK ARCH - NIGHT 
Eep steps into a small clearing. Stuck in the ground, is a TORCH. As far as Eep knows, this is the thing she was following. Eep crouches down and cautiously approaches. 
REVERSE ANGLE - Eep can feel the heat from the fire on the palms of her hands and her face. TENSE. EXCITING. 
But camouflaged against the rock wall behind her, something MOVES. A WARTHOG CREATURE stands upright and creeps up behind her. 
Eep reaches out to TOUCH the flame. The torch blows away from her. The wind has changed direction. The breeze at her back, Eep smells the Creature behind her. On her face, awe turns to determination as she wheels and grabs the creature. She THROWS and FLIPS it over her shoulder. It hits the torch, knocking it to the ground. Eep jumps back, GRABBING a good-sized rock - she's poised to bash the Creature's brains in. 
CREATURE Nuh! Nuh! 
The Creature defensively raises its arms, hands in front of its face. 
GUY No! 
Hands? Eep GASPS, shocked to see HUMAN HANDS attached to this monstrosity. 
The Creature slowly puts his hands to the sides of his grotesque head, and RAISES its mask. It's a boy... he's BEAUTIFUL! This is GUY. 
EEP Augh! 
Eep LEAPS BACK a few paces, DROPPING the rock on Guy's foot. 
GUY AAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHH! 
EEP Shhh! 
Eep moves swiftly to silence him. She POUNCES on him and TWISTS his head sideways. Guy is SUFFOCATING. He feels around for a stick and BASHES Eep in the side of the head. 
EEP (CONT'D) Ow! 
GUY (GASPING) Air. 
EEP ...You talk. 
EEP (to the flame) Hi, fire. 
GUY (LAUGHING) It's not alive. EEP But you said it was dying. 
GUY Uh sorry,-- 
EEP It comes from where you come from? 
GUY No. I make it. 
Eep BALLS her fist, GRABBING Guy tightly by the hair. 
EEP Make some for me. 
GUY Ow. Okay, it doesn't come out of me. 
EEP Make. MAKE! MAKE IT! 
Eep SQUEEZES Guy like a tube of toothpaste. 
GUY You do this a lot. 
Something CRACKS. Eep DROPS Guy - he's broken. 
EEP Are you dead? Can I have your fire if you're dead? 
Belt RUBS two flat rocks together and places them on Guy's chest like defibrillator paddles. Guy BOLTS upright. 
GUY Hey, those are cold! 
BELT Squirf! 
GUY You think? Listening shells, activate. 
Belt AND Guy use shells to LISTEN to the ground. 
GUY (CONT'D) I concur. Tiger girl, we need to leave immediately. He tries to pull her by the arm. She stays put like an anchor. 
EEP I don't even know you. 
GUY (pained, rushed) Ow. I'm Guy. 
EEP Guy? 
GUY And this is Belt. Cook, conversationalist, navigator, also keeps my pants up. 
BELT Hhiiyaa! Yaaa! 
EEP What are "pants up?" 
GUY Who are you? 
EEP Eep. 
GUY (cutting her off) Let me clarify, Eep. The world is ending. 
EEP What? 
GUY I'm calling it... (VERY DRAMATIC) The... End. 
BELT Da da daaaaa. 
EEP How do you know? 
Guy and Belt both do gestures to accompany the Da da daaaa. It seems very important to them. 
GUY I've seen it. It's coming this way. First, the Earth is going to shake. Then it breaks open. Everything falls in. Fire. Lava. I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but Aaaaaaaugh. Believe me, everything we're standing on, all this right here, will be gone. 
Again with the gestures. It's a little weird to Eep. 
GUY (CONT'D) We've got to get to high ground. I know a mountain, that way-- 
EEP No. He was nice. 
GRUG What!? Excuse me? He? 
EEP Oh. Well, I thought he was a warthog, but then he turned into a boy. 
GRAN Strange. Usually it's the reverse. 
Grug RAISES an eyebrow. 
THUNK Eep's got a boy hog! Eep's got a boy hog! 
Eep ELBOWS Thunk in the back of his head. 
EEP There was a boy. Watch, okay. I'm gonna call him. 
Eep pulls out the SHELL. She BLOWS into the shell - the sound ALARMS the Croods. 
They SMACK the shell from Eep's hand and SMASH it with their rocks. 
Eep is incredulous. The dust clears - the panting Croods are satisfied the object is gone. EEP (CONT'D) What is wrong with you? 
GRUG It was dangerous. 
EEP (VERY ANGRY) It was beautiful. You want to see dangerous? Here. 
She pelts Thunk with a rock. 
THUNK Owww! My sniffer! 
GRUG Okay Eep, that's it. We're going back to the cave and you're going to stay in there until you're older than... her! 
EEP What!? You can't keep me inside forever! 
Eep throws a tantrum of epic proportion. She SLAMS a rock on the ground. It SHATTERS to dust. 
CREAK! A strange GROAN is heard from under the ground. Then a small amount of sand falls from up above. A crack starts to splinter under their feet. 
EEP (CONT'D) He said this would happen. 
Then BOOM! The ground starts to SHAKE! 
GRUG Get to the cave! GO! 
The Croods RACE through the CANYON NARROWS, fighting their way through falling boulders and shifting ground, heading towards the safety of their cave. 
The Croods see the cave entrance. The canyon walls above their home start to crack. Grug sees that the falling rock will crush the cave. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Look out! Stop! 
Grug leaps and tackles his family, protecting them from the mass of rocks crashing down. The top of the canyon collapses and the Crood's cave is destroyed. Everything is engulfed by dust. The earth settles. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
SEQ. 710 - CROSSING OVER 
The dust clears a bit - the Croods are in a tight ball, covered by Grug. Grug stands, all Croods were sheltered and safe under his mighty arms. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Is everyone okay? 
UGGA Yes. Grug, the cave, it's gone. 
Grug looks back to Crood cave. It is gone. 
GRUG No. 
Grug searches the rubble for any sign that the cave might still be there. He finds one handprint, split in two. 
He carefully fits them back together. Emotional, he lowers his head. 
As Eep steps forward, a shaft of light filtering through the dusty veil from the wreckage crosses her face-- 
Grug BARELY catches Sandy by her leg. Grug PULLS her back like a dog on a leash. 
GRUG No, no! Come back, Sandy! 
Sandy has a MOUSEPHANT in her mouth. Grug knocks it from Sandy's mouth. A gaggle of mousephants run out from the bush and scurry away. 
GRUG (CONT'D) (TENSE WHISPER) We can't be out in the open like this. We need a cave. Now step where I step. 
They start moving. 
GRUG (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) Okay. Stay quiet. Hopefully nothing big knows we're here yet. PULL BACK - a huge colorful predator, THE MACAWNIVORE senses something. He SITS UP and STALKS OFF. 
ON THE CROODS moving fitfully through the strange forest. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay. Wait. Okay. 
The Croods cautiously move in fits and stops through the middle of this thick, pre-historic rainforest. 
THUNK (RAMBLING) So Dad, just to be clear, are we looking for the exact same cave? (MORE) THUNK (CONT'D) If it was me, I'm just throwing this out there, if it was me choosing the cave, I would go with a smaller cave. 
As they trek, strange creatures (BEAR PEARS, PUNCH MONKEYS) watch these foreigners. 
In the front of the line, Grug is freaked out. But in the back Eep is taking in the wonders. They pass through a curtain of hefty hanging pears. After they pass the "pears" all turn to watch the Croods. 
A leaf FLUTTERS down. 
GRUG Wait. 
Eep and Grug LOOK UP. 
WE PULL BACK TO REVEAL THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY PUNCH MONKEYS. 
THUNK Dad? 
GRUG I'll take care of this. 
Grug launches into his Threat Display - 
GRUG (CONT'D) WWAAAAaaarrgghhaarrraaaarrgghhh!! 
He flails his arms around and jumps about in front of the nearest Punch Monkey. No reaction from the Punch Monkey. Grug stops, confused... The Punch Monkey now breaks into a BROAD GRIN... Then hauls off and - THUD - Punches Grug in the face! Grug reels back, surprised - turns... Right into another Punch Monkey. It winds up and - THUD! - it hits Grug - Grug reels back - into another Monkey - THUD! - 
THUNK Alright dad, go get `em! Oh, oh, now you got em-- Now they're really hitting you. Dad I got it, just stop running into their fists. 
Gran joins in and punches Grug in the nose. 
GRAN Hah, I'm loving this. 
UGGA Grug, when you're done, we should get going. 
Wide shot: Grug is being bounced back and forth like a pinball from one punch Monkey to the next. The Punch Monkeys are whooping and hollering - this is great fun! The Punch Monkeys let go of Grug and begin running away for no apparent reason. 
Grug staggers backwards into the family. 
GRUG That's right! You can't get past this! 
CHUNKY ROOOAR! 
A colorful 'bush' rears up - it's not a bush, it's a MACAWNIVORE! The Croods react, terrified 
Grug throws a rock at it. The Macawnivore catches the rock and SPRINGS! - 
CROODS GASPS 
GRUG Climb! Climb! Climb! 
Grug pushes and forces the Croods up a huge tree then as it steps away-- it is actually a giant animal. 
GRUG'S POV: A cave! GRUG (CONT'D) CAVE! GO! GO! 
The Croods jump off the bird leg in hopes of getting to the cave. 
GUY Cavemen! Stand back! They're practically animals. See their bony, sloping foreheads? 
EEP Oh... yeah! 
GUY The huge primitive teeth? 
EEP Er... yeah... 
GUY The excessive body hair? Oh, that one's got a tail... 
EEP Uhhh... yeah... 
Guy PULLS his knife. GUY Close your eyes. I'm going to have to take their lives. 
EEP (slapping the knife away) No. It won't help. (EMBARRASSED) They're my family. 
GUY What? 
Eep nods toward Thunk. 
THUNK Ah, the sun is in his hands! 
The Croods keep circling. 
EEP No. No. It's "fire." 
UGGA Where did it come from? 
EEP (PROUDLY) He made it. 
Grug grabs him and squeezes him tight. 
GRUG Make some for me! 
EEP It doesn't come out of him. 
GRUG Make. Make it. 
POP! Guy's ribs are cracked for the second time. 
GUY You know, you're a lot like your daughter. 
Guy falls in a heap. 
EEP Great, now he's broken. 
UGGA (O.S.) Oh, it's a baby sun. Grug turns to see Ugga, Thunk, Gran and Sandy are now sitting very close around the fire, transfixed. 
GRUG Whoa! Stay back. We don't know what it wants. 
As Grug moves around the circle, picking up sitting Croods and placing them a safe distance from the fire, he talks to them like a kindergarten teacher: 
GRUG (CONT'D) Now we'll all sit here, and wait for the sun to come back. And tomorrow we'll find a new cave, and pretend today never happened. (MORE) GRUG (CONT'D) (looks at the fire) Isn't this fun, Eep? 
Grug looks around to see that Eep is kneeling beside Guy. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Eep, don't touch him. Goodness knows where he's been. 
Suddenly, behind Grug, Sandy ATTACKS the torch. She shakes it with her teeth, EMBERS FLY EVERYWHERE. 
THUNK Dad, Sandy's hurting fire. 
Grug reaches down and scoops up Sandy. (NOTE: From this point, Grug will hold onto Sandy, no matter how much she struggles, kicks and bites.) 
GRUG Sandy! No! Fire is not a play thing! 
UGGA Aww, what a cute little guy. 
GRUG Hey, stay back. 
The Croods snatch at the embers as they dance in the air around them. 
The giant ear of corn explodes blasting Gran off frame who slams into Thunk. The speeding ear picks up Ugga, Grug. 
ON EEP AND GUY 
EEP They're not so scary once you get to know them. 
Eep and Guy are HIT by the speeding corn. 
GUY Who are you people? 
UGGA Oh, I'm sorry. We're the Croooooods! And you are? 
GUY Uh, Guy. 
CROODS (WAVING) Hi, Guy. 
The speeding ear CRASHES into a lone tree, sending Guy and the Croods sprawling across the tundra. The flying ears ROCKET SKYWARD and BURST like colorful fireworks. 
THUNK Wow! Looks like magic. And smells like food. 
Popcorn kernels RAIN DOWN upon the Croods. They are BURIED. 
GRUG Don't eat it, it's new. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
SEQ. 1425 - THE GOAL IS SET 
The Croods burst out of a mountain of popcorn. 
CROODS Still alive! 
ON THE BASE OF THE POPCORN PILE 
GUY (0.S.) Come on, keep eating. 
BELT Squirf! 
Guy BURROWS out the side of the popcorn pile like a prisoner escaping Alcatraz. 
GUY gasping for air (checks to see if he's been SPOTTED) 
EEP Hey, where's Guy? 
Guy RUNS for the mountain. Eep POUNCES on Guy like a tiger. 
GUY No! 
EEP Going somewhere? 
GUY The mountain? High ground? End of the world, remember? 
EEP That already happened. It destroyed our cave. 
GUY (STRUGGLING) Noooo. That was just the beginning of the end. The end of the end is still coming. 
GRUG (as if to a dog) Eep. Drop it. 
Eep SETS him down. Guy BOLTS but discovers Eep hasn't let go of his hand. Guy is YANKED backwards like he's been tied to a piling. 
EEP We can't let him go! What if we don't find a cave before sunset? What if it takes a few days? What if the birds come back? 
BEAT. 
GRAN We need his fire, dummy! 
WHOOSH! Grug grabs Guy and throws him in a log. 
GRUG Fine. You're staying with us till we find a cave. 
Grug hoists Guy in the log onto his shoulder. 
EEP (CONT'D) Stop shoving, or I will pull out your tongue! 
GRUG Do you want me to turn this family around? Do you?! Because I will turn this family around so fast! 
The camera slowly pulls out from the family in chaos as they walk across the burned out landscape. 
X-DISS TO: The Croods are traveling across the dry land. The camera has pulled out from the family as they travel. Family chaos continues. 
THUNK Dad, I gotta go! 
GRUG Come on, you can hold it. 
THUNK I don't think so. 
THUNK MOANS 
THUNK (CONT'D) (NEAR TEARS) I gotta go really bad. 
Thunk starts to HOP WITH HIS KNEES GLUED TO EACH OTHER. 
GRUG (RELINQUISHING) Go behind one of those lumpy things and make it fast. 
THUNK Ow! Something bit me! 
GRAN (LOUD) I don't blame it. 
UGGA Maybe we should have stopped for water. 
X-DISS TO: 
A Liyote turns to watch the Croods as they travel. 
EEP Dad, can I take a turn carrying him? 
GRUG No. 
EEP How about now? 
GRUG No. 
EEP Now? GRUG No. 
EEP NOW?!?! 
GRUG NO! 
EEP (even louder) NOW?!?! 
GRUG I can do this all day long. No, no, no, and still no. 
X-DISS TO: 
Oh yeah, more traveling. Now we are in the Turkeyfish hunting grounds. The camera is so far away the Croods are only a speck in the frame. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
Grug, exhausted, in the foreground with family chaos over his shoulder. 
GRAN I'm not dying on an empty stomach. 
UGGA Grug, we're all pretty tired. 
THUNK I'm pretty dizzy, so I'm just going to lay down for a minute. 
GRUG We'll eat when we get there. 
GRAN It's taking too long! I'm grabbing a snack. 
Gran jumps up and tries to grab Belt. Belt pulls a bone knife and defends himself. 
GUY No. No. No. Don't do that. He will cut you. That's not food, he's a pet. My pet. 
Grug grudgingly DROPS the log. 
GUY (CONT'D) Now, kick it away. 
Grug BARELY NUDGES it. 
GUY (CONT'D) Farther. 
Grug KICKS it a quarter-mile. 
GUY (CONT'D) Really?! 
GRUG Okay, smart, Guy... now what? 
Guy SMILES. 
HARD CUT TO: 
EXT. CORAL FIELDS - LATER 
Everyone is now wearing "shoes" -- some made of leaves, sponges and some are actually fish! 
Ugga and Gran wobble on their new shoes. 
Thunk is covering his eyes, too afraid to look down. Thunk looks down at his horrifying fish shoes. They blink at him. 
THUNK Ahhhh! Good fish. 
Eep is covering her eyes. 
GUY Okay. Now you can look. 
Eep peers down at her new boots. 
EEP Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhh! I love them! Where are my feet!? GUY They're still there! 
EEP Oh, okay. 
Eep slips, and falls into Guy's arms. 
GUY Whoa. You're really (GETTING CRUSHED) ... heavy. 
EEP Really? Thank you! 
Grug walks over as the two fall to the ground. 
GRUG Hey, wait. Whoa. Whoa. WHOA!! 
GUY (SWEATING) Okay! She's up. I'm good. We're good... 
GRAN These shoes are great! Where do you get these ideas? 
GUY Ah ha. 
On cue, Belt produces a piece of chalk. 
Guy stands Thunk against a wall. Guy stands next to him. Belt OUTLINES them. Guy excitedly gestures to the silhouettes. 
GUY (CONT'D) I'm calling it, a brain. I'm pretty sure it's where ideas come from. 
THUNK Dad. I don't have a brain. 
GRUG We've gotten along just fine without brains till now. Cavemen don't need brains. We have these. Heeya! Haha! (balls his mighty fists) That's what I'm talking about! Ideas are for weaklings. Grug punches at the air in front of Guy making him wince. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Now, let's get to that mountain. 
Ugga and Eep notice each other's shoes. 
UGGA/EEP Oh wow. I love those! 
THUNK Good fish. Don't eat my feet. 
GRUG (FRUSTRATED) Eep, looks dangerous. 
EEP Oh dad, you say that about everything. 
Eep goes to jump in the water. Guy STOPS her. 
GUY Careful. 
EEP Oh really? Okay. 
Guy CANNONBALLS. Then SURFACES. 
Eep tentatively HOPS in. Guy STEADIES her. Then shows her how to move her arms in a swimming motion. 
Guy SUPPORTS Eep by holding one hand under her tummy. She begins to SWIM. 
Gran and Ugga SMILE mischievously - a positive vibe is building. 
The Croods ALL JUMP at once. 
Grug is left alone. Belt uses Grug's arm as a diving platform. Gran, Sandy and Belt are doing synchronized swimming. Then Grug sees Eep and Guy SURFACE - Eep is on Guy's shoulders! This is too much for Grug! 
GRUG Augh! No no no! Not cool. Not cool. Not cool. 
Grug DIVES IN to put a stop to any potential shenanigans. 
Grug's huge tidal wave SWAMPS Guy and Eep. Grug SINKS to the bottom. 
ON GRUG laying on the bottom. His family SWIMS above him on the tails of Fishcats, confident and free and buoyant. 
A lone bubble escapes Grug's nose, like oil oozing from a sunken wreck. He's feeling mighty extraneous. 
Grug sees the Macawnivore swimming towards him. Grug swims for his life. Ends in a big splash. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
SEQ. 1725 - MAZE 
PAN UP TO THE ENTRANCES TO THE MAZE 
GUY So the bear says, "Your cave?" I've been dumping my bones here since last week. 
GRAN Last week, haha. That's a funny story! 
GUY It's not a story! It's a joke. 
GRAN What's a joke? 
GUY You know, just making something up... to make you laugh. 
GRAN Hah, I don't get it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TUFA MAZE - AFTERNOON 
The Croods stand motionless before an open plain, deeply sculpted with meandering grooves which form a massive MAZE. 
Guy is handing out SHELLS to the Croods. 
GUY Here you go, one for you, and this ones for you. 
THUNK Thanks. 
Grug is annoyed by everyone blowing their shells. 
GRUG Okay. Okay. That's enough. I don't see why the kids need their own shells. 
GUY So if anyone gets in trouble, we can call the others. 
GRUG Wait-- you're saying we should split up? 
Ugga and Gran pass unharmed through the flower grove - the colors and smells are overpoweringly vibrant. 
Eep surprises Guy and Belt in their hideaway as the two of them continue to throw flowers over the edge and onto Eep's path. 
EEP You dropped these. 
Guy slips and falls onto a huge lilypad. He smiles up at Eep. 
They share a moment before Eep shyly vanishes again. 
Grug finds himself back at the entrance of the maze. He grumbles and enters a different tunnel. 
ON THE MAZE EXIT - 
Guy appears at the exit and puts his hand up to the setting sun that kisses the top of the mountain. Guy is amazed that he and Eep are both doing the same thing. He is smitten. Guy goes over to Eep. 
Guy takes her hand. GUY Come with me. 
Eep and Guy turn to each other, just as Thunk emerges and tosses a rock for the Croco-Pup to fetch. 
THUNK Here boy, catch! 
A shell note signals Ugga, Gran and Sandy's arrival. There is an obvious change in the ladies. 
THUNK (CONT'D) Gran? 
Ugga removes her hat to reveal her new look. 
EEP Mom? 
BELT (APPROVING) Raaah raaah. 
A loud shell blast interrupts. It is followed by two others. 
UGGA Grug? 
Grug lets out another blow on his horn. 
UGGA (CONT'D) I'll go get him. 
ON GRUG still stuck in the maze. He holds his head in defeat, and TOSSES the shell down. 
TRUCK-IN on Grug. 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 1175 - UNDER THE STARS 
PAN UP a giant redwood tree. The Croods are gathered in a cozy crook of the tree. 
Belt mixes drinks while Gran relaxes in a hammock. Thunk is playing with his new pet. 
THUNK Good boy. Whose my good boy? You need a name, you want a name? I'm going to call you - Douglas. Look at him. Can you do tricks? Roll over. Come on Douglas, roll over. 
Douglas ROLLS OVER, right OFF the tree. 
THUNK (CONT'D) Good boy Douglas! 
Belt POURS a drink for Gran. Sandy takes Gran her drink as she spins over to her on her starfish shoes. 
GRAN I was in love once. He was a hunter, I was a gatherer. It was quite a scandal. We fed each other berries. We danced. (MORE) GRAN (CONT'D) Then my father smashed him with a rock and traded me to your Grandfather. 
SANDY/THUNK/EEP Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! 
BELT Ha ha ha ha. 
PAN DOWN TO TREE BASE 
Ugga and Grug approach. They hear the LAUGHING coming from high above. Grug peers up and sees the SWINGING HAMMOCKS, torch lights. 
GRUG (PANIC) Croods! Come get down here! 
Thousands of birds fly overhead darkening the sky. 
The shell boat hits the shore. The Croods step out onto land. 
An explosion goes off on a nearby mountain. A PLUME of magma BURSTS from the water in the distance. 
Grug looks around for shelter and spots a cave. 
GRUG Cave! Everyone inside. Come on! Hurry up, let's go. Go, go. 
The Croods don't want to move. 
EEP No. 
UGGA (GENTLY) No more caves, Grug. 
GRUG What? 
GRAN We're gonna jump on the sun and ride it to Tomorrow with Guy. 
GRUG Wait, so you're all going to do this? 
Silence from the Croods answers his question. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Thunk? 
THUNK Sorry, dad. 
Thunk joins the others. It's the last straw. 
EEP You have to stop worrying for all of us. GRUG It's my job to worry. It's my job to follow the rules. 
EEP The rules don't work out here. 
GRUG They kept us alive. 
EEP That wasn't living, that was just, not dying. There's a difference. 
GRUG Ugga, everyone, you have to listen to me. 
Ugga doesn't move. 
EEP We would be dead if we listened you. 
Grug is STUNNED. 
EEP (CONT'D) We have to follow Guy now. 
Grug slowly turns around to face Guy. He is smoldering. 
GRUG Guy? 
UGGA Guy, run. 
Grug lunges toward Guy, SCREAMING. 
GRUG AAAAAAAAAAUGHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! 
Grug ATTACKS Guy - they fall down an embankment. 
CUT TO: 
SEQ. 2100 - TAR PIT 
Grug CHASES Guy across a TREMBLING landscape. 
GUY This is pointless. We're running out of time. Everything is collapsing. You're being irrational and counterproductive. 
GRUG Big words anger me. Keep talking. 
GUY Countermeasures. 
SEQ. 2250 - GRUG & GUY ESCAPE 
We are tracking with the MACAWNIVORE. Suddenly, the big cat stops. His eyebrows raise. 
MACAWNIVORE'S POV - a FEMALE MACAWNIVORE PUPPET. 
BELT TA-DAAAAA 
GRUG Wow. 
GUY Yeah, I know. But he's doing the best with what he has. Let's go. 
Grug and Guy are holding bones connected to the puppet. Belt SIGNALS to Guy. 
GUY (CONT'D) There he is. Belt, I want romance, drama, sincerity. Move me. 
Belt makes music, which grabs the Macawnivore's attention. 
GUY (CONT'D) Okay he sees us! Belt plays a little melodramatic tune. 
Grug halfheartedly moves the bones he's holding. 
GUY (CONT'D) That's our cue. Now work it! 
The puppet starts shaking its tail. 
GUY (CONT'D) He's not coming over. I don't think our puppet looks scared enough. 
GRUG Scared? I'll show you scared. Hand me those acting sticks! 
Grug shakes the puppet and makes a frightening sound of terror. 
Suddenly, the Macawnivore leaps forward and jumps on the puppet. He grabs it and pulls it up out of the tar, bringing Grug and Guy along with it. 
Grug and Guy hang on to the bones of the puppet frame. 
The Macawnivore shakes the puppet, pulling it out of the tar along with Grug and Guy. 
GUY Hold on! 
The puppet breaks apart, the Macawnivcore turns to Grug and Guy. He is not pleased. 
BELT Da da daaaaaa... 
The Macawnivore dashes towards the pair. They try to run from him. The Macawnivore's paws slip slowly backwards into the nearby tar--he's stuck. The tar snaps him back and throws him far from Grug and Guy. 
Belt blows a whistle signalling a field goal! 
GRUG Yes. You did it! 
Grug PATS Guy on the back. Grug realizes his hand is stuck to Guy's back. 
The Croods come running to help them. UGGA Grug. 
THUNK Dad! 
Grug and Guy TURN to see the rest of the Croods. Grug waves to the family with Guy stuck to his hand. 
GUY Hey, we're okay! 
The family stops to take this in. 
GUY (CONT'D) Yeah, we're okay. 
The ground shakes violently. Meteors stream across the sky. 
GUY (CONT'D) Grug. Your call. 
Grug knows his answer. 
GRUG Take us to Tomorrow. 
GUY Heh. That's a joke, right? 
GRUG What's a joke? 
Grug's comment freaks Guy out. ANOTHER ANGLE shows Grug with a twinkle in his eye. 
Belt puts on his helmet for safety. With a titanic effort, he HURLS Guy in to the void. 
The Croods wait an eternity. Then - a HORN SOUNDS. 
UGGA He made it... He made it... 
GRUG Okay, Thunk. Your turn. 
THUNK You're not coming, are you? 
GRUG When you make it, so will I. 
Grug HURLS Thunk. 
Ugga KISSES Grug. She whispers in his ear. 
UGGA You did good. 
SANDY Daddy. 
Grug wipes a tear from Ugga's eye. Then lifts her above his head. He HURLS her across. 
GRUG Gran. 
Gran is next in line. 
GRAN No mush, just throw me. 
Grug LIFTS her above his head. 
GRAN (CONT'D) Wait. You surprised me today. Lunkhead. 
Grug SMILES and throws her next. 
GRAN (CONT'D) (landing on the other side) Still alive!!! 
Another TREMBLER. MORE cliff FALLS away. Now the distance is even greater. 
Eep is next in line. 
GRUG Time to go. 
EEP No. I have too much to say to you. I need to fix everything and I don't have time. 
GRUG I can fix it. 
Grug embraces Eep. 
EEP This works good. What do you call it? 
GRUG I was thinking of calling it a Hug. (clears his throat) (MORE) GRUG (CONT'D) Because it rhymes with Grug. But you can change it if you want. 
EEP No. I like a "Hug." 
A BEAT. 
GRUG I love you. 
Eep takes in the full effect of her dad's words. 
EEP I... 
The ground begins to shake and break apart around them. 
EEP (CONT'D) Dad, I'm scared. 
As the cage flies, above the fiery landscape, Grug sees Douglas, sitting forlornly with the shell still in his mouth. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Douglas? 
Grug doesn't even debate it, he runs back for the little monstrosity. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Hey, I know that guy. 
Grug JUMPS out of the cage and rushes over to grab the gerbils. Then Grug notices a familiar Liyote hiding under a nearby rock. He GRABS the Liyote. Grug sees the TRIP-GERBILS stranded as well. Grug TWIRLS the Trip- Gerbils around his neck like a scarf. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Get up! 
A ROAR BUILDS behind Grug - the pyroclastic flow is SPEEDING closer. 
Grug CATCHES UP to the lumbering blimp-cage. He PUSHES it to go faster. 
GRUG (CONT'D) Hold on. 
The pyroclastic cloud BLASTS up the narrow passage. Finally, with Grug's strength, the cage CLEARS the edge of the cliff. 
The CLOUD HITS them all, SWALLOWING the Cage like a speck. 
CUT TO: 
SQ 3000 REUNITED - 05.16.2012 
EXT. "TOMORROW" 
ON EEP 
Standing at the edge of the cliff alone, BLOWING her shell horn. Behind her, Sandy HOWLS. Gran puts a comforting arm around her grandchildren, even she has a tear in her eye. 
The ground begins to shake softly. 
GUY It's not safe here. 
GRAN I'll tell her. 
Gran walks up to Eep. Eep continues to blow her shell horn. Eep and Gran share a moment. Eep breaks into tears. Gran looks at her shell horn and BLOWS it loudly. Eep is happily surprised. 
The whole family, even Guy, steps up next to Eep and begins BLOWING their shell horns. 
It's clear from Eep's expression she has no intention of budging. 
EEP I never got to tell him. 
Ugga appeals to Eep. 
UGGA Eep, if your Dad were here, he would tell YOU TO-- 
GRUG (O.S.) GET OUT OF THE WAY!!! 
THUNK Wow, you sound just like him. 
Ugga looks up. Guy LOOKS UP. Everyone looks up! 
GRUG (O.S.) GET OUT OF THE WAY!!! 
SANDY Daddy! EEP He did it! 
GUY He's riding the Sun... but not very well. Everybody out of the way! 
Grug CRASHES near the family. They run to meet him. 
THUNK Dad! 
UGGA Grug! 
GRUG Ahhh! Where's the danger? Who blew their shell? 
But all Grug sees is his astonished family staring back at him.

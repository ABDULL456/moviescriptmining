FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS 
FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS 
by 
Terry Gilliam & Toy Grisoni 
BLACK SCREEN 
A desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters singing "My Favorite Things." A series of sepia images of anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after another on the screen. 
In the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing: 
TITLE: "He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain Of being a man." Dr. Johnson 
The VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE: 
DUKE (V/O) We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. 
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! 
A red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black screen. 
EXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY 
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! 
THE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred miles an hour.  THE STONES' "Sympathy For the Devil" blares. 
AT THE WHEEL 
STRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL, BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD. 
BESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO. 
The music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam. 
DUKE (V/O) I remember saying something like: "I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe you should drive..." 
GONZO starts shaving. 
DUKE (V/O) Suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car... 
Close on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES! 
AAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! 
DUKE (V/O) ... and a voice was screaming: Holy Jesus!  What are these goddamn animals? 
CUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR - 
DUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere. GONZO casually looks over... 
GONZO What are you yelling about? 
DUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench makes GONZO nick his face with his razor. 
DUKE Never mind.  It's your turn to drive. 
DUKE (V/O) No point mentioning these bats.  I thought.  The poor bastard will see them soon enough. 
DUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats, frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles through the impressive stash. 
DUKE (V/O) We had two bags of grass, seventy- five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi- colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls. 
DUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives back into the car. 
DUKE (V/O) Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. 
THE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground, weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A BAT? 
DUKE (roaring over the road noise) THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY UNDERSTAND -- 
The HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking. 
DUKE (yells) CAN YOU HEAR ME? 
The HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs into the back seat. 
DUKE That's good.  Because I want you to have all the background.  This is a very ominous assignment -- with overtones of extreme personal danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism! This is important, goddamnit!  This is a true story!... (WHACKS the BACK OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT with his fist) 
The CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out. 
GONZO (screams) Keep your hands off my fucking neck! 
The HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS HIM BACK DOWN. 
DUKE (V/O) Our vibrations were getting nasty -- but why?  Was there no communication in this car?  Had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts? 
The HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC. 
DUKE (to HITCHHIKER) I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I think he's probably Samoan.  But it doesn't matter, does it?  Are you prejudiced? 
HITCHHIKER Hell, no! 
DUKE I didn't think so.  Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I forgot all about this beer.  You want one? (HITCHHIKER shakes his head) How about some ether? 
HITCHHIKER What? 
DUKE Never mind.  Let's get right to the heart of this thing.  Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel... 
INT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY 
A uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They are the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS. 
DUKE (V/O) ... in the patio section, of course, drinking Singapore Slings with mescal on the side, hiding from the brutish realities of this foul year of Our Lord, 1971. 
The DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and shades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank top undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious conversation. 
DUKE I'm telling you, the Salazar story is getting too complicated.  The weasels have started closing in. 
The DWARF sneers. 
DWARF Perhaps this is the call you've been waiting for all this time, sir... 
DUKE lifts the receiver -- listens... 
DUKE Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... 
DUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A MOVIE SPY. 
DWARF That was headquarters.  They want me to go to Las Vegas at once and make contact with a Portuguese photographer named Lacerda.  He'll have the details.  All I have to do is check into my sound proof suite and he'll seek me out. 
GONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table! 
GONZO God hell!  I think I see the pattern!  This one sounds like real trouble!  You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over.  As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine.  And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts... (GONZO tucks his khaki undershirt into his white bellbottoms -- he means business!) This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves. 
DUKE Why not?  If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right. 
DUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them with the (very large) check in his hand. 
They sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF. 
DUKE I tell you, my man.  This is the American Dream in action!  We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end. 
GONZO Indeed.  We must do it.  What kind of story is this? 
EXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY 
DUKE and GONZO emerge. 
DUKE The Mint 400!  The richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune- buggies in the history of organized sport! (handing parking ticket to Valet) -- a fantastic spectacle in honor of some fatback grossero who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel in the heart of downtown Vegas... at least that's what the press release says. 
Her face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING... 
DUKE (shouts) NO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING YET! 
The FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS. DEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE. 
GONZO I can handle this.  This man has a bad heart, but I have plenty of medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo. Prepare our suite at once.  We'll be in the bar. 
GONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks back -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green jowls and fangs. 
INT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY 
The bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme. DUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the wall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone... 
GONZO (to the bartender) Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side. (opens the envelope) Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor? 
DUKE Lacerda? 
DUKE (V/O) I couldn't remember.  The name rang a bell, but I couldn't concentrate. Terrible things were happening all around us... 
DUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY onto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low. 
DUKE Order some golf shoes.  Otherwise, we'll never get out of this place alive.  It's impossible to walk in this muck -- no footing at all... 
DUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared. 
DUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER. 
DUKE (V/O) I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo.  And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things!  It won't be long before they tear us to shreds! 
GONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER. 
GONZO If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators. 
GONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying... as he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to keep him in his line of vision. 
GONZO I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda.  I told him I knew what he was up to... (GONZO rallies -- turns fierce) He says he's a photographer!  But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked!  He knows we're onto him! 
DUKE But what about our room?  And the golf shoes? 
A GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at them, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS. 
DUKE (CONT'D) (grabbing GONZO trying to hold him still) Holy shit!  Look at that bunch over there!  They've spotted us! 
Cut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing next to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality. GONZO is sitting in his original position. 
GONZO (downs his drink -- gets up) That's the press table.  Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with.  You handle that, and I'll check on the room. 
DUKE No, no.  Don't leave me! 
Black screen. 
INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK 
A TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK, protesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous BELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on the floor next to DUKE. 
BELL BOY Four club sandwiches, four shrimp cocktails. 
DUKE There's a big... machine in the sky... some kind of electric snake... 
DUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon sign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million colored lights. 
BELL BOY ... a quart of rum... 
DUKE ... coming straight at us. 
GONZO Shoot it. 
DUKE Not yet.  I want to study its habits. 
BELL BOY ... and nine fresh grapefruit. 
DUNE BUGGY DRIVER Where's the damn race? 
DUKE Beats me.  We're just good patriotic Americans like yourself. 
DUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN.  In response, the PASSENGER #2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his grip on an automatic weapon. 
DUNE BUGGY DRIVER (suspiciously) What outfit you fellas with? 
DUKE The sporting press.  We're friendlies.  Hired geeks. 
The DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks. 
DUKE If you want a good chase, you should get after that skunk from CBS News up ahead in the black jeep. He's the man responsible for that book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON. 
DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1 HOT DAMN! 
DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A black jeep, you say? 
And they ROAR away. 
DUKE Take me back to the pits. 
LACERDA No, no -- we have to go on.  We need total coverage. 
DUKE gets out of the Bronco. 
DUKE You're fired. 
After a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust. 
DUKE (V/O) It was time.  I felt, for an Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole scene.  The race was definitely under way.  I had witnessed the start; I was sure of that much. But what now? 
EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT 
MUSIC PUMPS OUT.  CRUISING IN THE RED SHARK IN VEGAS.  THE SKY SWIRLS WITH MILLIONS OF NEON LIGHTS CHASING EACH OTHER IN BAROQUE PATTERNS ACROSS GIGANTIC HOTEL SIGNS.  PSYCHEDELIC LIGHT SHOWS TO LURE AND DERANGE THE INNOCENT.  CITY OF LOST SOULS. 
DUKE Turn up the radio!  Turn up the tape machine!  Roll the windows down.  Let's taste this cool desert wind!  Aaah, yes!  This is what it's all about! 
DUKE, beer in hand, drives -- a big smile for the world. GONZO scans The Vegas Visitor. 
DUKE (V/O) Total control now.  Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people! 
GONZO How about "Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?" "Hot Slots," that sounds heavy.  Twenty-nine cent hotdogs... 
DUKE Look, what are we doing here?  Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job? 
GONZO To do the job, of course.  Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars! 
The Shark hits a bump. 
GONZO As your attorney I advise you to drive over to the Tropicana and pick up on Guy Lombardo.  He's in the Blue Room with his Royal Canadians. 
They hit another bump. 
DUKE Why? 
GONZO Why what? 
CUT to wide shot.  They are DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES in a large casino parking lot, bumping over the dividers. 
DUKE Why should I pay out my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse. I don't know about you, but in my line of business it's important to be Hep. 
EXT. DESERT ROOM HOTEL - NIGHT 
TWO BIG SCREAMING FACES. 
DOORMAN #1 What the hell are you doing?! 
DOORMAN #2 You can't park here! 
DUKE Why not?  Is this not a reasonable place to park? 
EXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT 
Into the GLARING, CHASING LIGHTS of the entrance canopy steps DUKE in EC/U holding a KLEENEX SOAKED IN ETHER TO HIS NOSE. 
DUKE (V/O) Ah, devil ether.  It makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel... total loss of all basic motor skills; blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue -- (throws away kleenex) The mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column.  Which is interesting, because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it. 
DUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care- taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug. 
DUKE (V/O) You approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there, you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there, everything goes wrong. 
THE ETHER KICKS IN: 
DUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES, GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets. 
DUKE (V/O) Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on?  Then you hear yourself mumbling. 
DUKE (mumbling) Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My name is Brinks; I was born... Born? 
GONZO Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep. 
The ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES. 
DUKE (V/O) Ether is the perfect drug for Las Vegas.  In this town they love a drunk.  Fresh meat.  So they put us through the turnstiles and turned us loose inside. 
INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT 
Flames shoot up from below the casino.  Above, a HIGH WIRE ACT with FOUR MUZZLED WOLVERINES, SIX NYMPHET SISTERS FROM SAN DIEGO, TWO SILVER PAINTED POLACK BROTHERS, and THREE KOREAN KITTENS. 
The WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air.  TWO POLACKS swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly locked in a death battle. 
All plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES and SLOT MACHINES.  No one looks up.  The GAMBLERS REMAIN INTENT ON THE SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL, THE TURN OF THE CARD, THE ROLL OF A DICE. 
DUKE (V/O) Bazooko Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war. This was the Sixth Reich. 
Something causes DUKE to look down.  A dwarf carrying drinks on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to move out of the way. 
DUKE (V/O CONT'D) A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth but, nobody should be asked to handle this trip. 
GONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths. One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume.  A FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE. 
FAIRGROUND BARKER Stand in front of this fantastic machine, my friend.  For just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200 hundred feet tall on a screen above downtown Las Vegas. 
On a TV monitor a 200 FOOT HIGH DRUNKARD looms over the Las Vegas skyline screaming OBSCENITIES. 
FAIRGROUND BARKER 99 cents more for a voice message. Say whatever you want, fella. They'll hear you, don't worry about that.  Remember, you'll be 200 feet tall! 
ANOTHER BARKER Step right up!  Shoot the pasties off the nipples of this ten-foot bull-dyke and win a cotton candy goat! 
INT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT 
DUKE and GONZO sit on the revolving platform.  GONZO stares -- glassy eyed -- coming apart. 
GONZO I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me.  I think I'm getting The Fear. 
DUKE Nonsense.  We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve. 
GONZO That's what gives me The Fear. 
DUKE Look over there.  Two women fucking a Polar Bear. 
GONZO Please, don't tell me those things... Not now. (signals the waitress for two Wild Turkeys) This is my last drink.  How much money can you lend me? 
DUKE Not much.  Why? 
GONZO I have to go. 
DUKE GO? 
GONZO Yes.  Leave the country.  Tonight. 
DUKE Calm down.  You'll be straight in a few hours. 
DUKE locks the door.  The suite is crowded with ROOM SERVICE GOODIES.  DUKE turns to see GONZO staring at two hotel room keys.  EVERYTHING STOPS. 
GONZO Where did this one come from? 
DUKE snatches a key. 
DUKE That's Lacerda's room. 
GONZO smiles a slow smile... 
GONZO Yeah... I thought we might need it... 
DUKE What for? 
GONZO snatches the key back. 
GONZO Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose. 
DUKE No, we should leave the poor bastard alone.  I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason. 
GONZO Don't kid yourself.  That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous.  He's watching us like a hawk. 
DUKE He told me he was turning in early... 
GONZO utters an anguished cry -- slaps the wall with both hands. 
GONZO That dirty bastard!  I knew it! He's got hold of my woman! 
DUKE (laughing) That little blonde groupie with the film crew?  You think he sodomized her? 
GONZO That's right, laugh about it!  You goddamn honkies are all the same! 
GONZO SLASHES A GRAPEFRUIT with a HUGE RAZOR SHARP HUNTING KNIFE.  DUKE blanches. 
DUKE Where'd you get that knife? 
GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- MANIACAL. 
GONZO Room service sent it up.  I wanted something to cut the limes. 
GONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS! 
DUKE What limes? 
GONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS! 
GONZO They didn't have any.  They don't grow in the desert. 
SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE! 
GONZO That dirty toad bastard!  I knew I should have taken him out when I had the chance.  Now he has her. 
SLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO SLASHES INSANELY! 
DUKE watches -- straight-faced. 
DUKE (V/O) I remember the girl.  We'd had a problem with her in the elevator a few hours earlier: my attention had made a fool of himself. 
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK) 
An elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF LACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW. 
DUKE and GONZO stagger in. 
LACERDA drops his smile.  He's standing beside the BLONDE TV REPORTER.  A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her. 
BLONDE TV REPORTER (to Gonzo) You must be a rider.  What class are you in? 
GONZO Class?  What the fuck do you mean? 
BLONDE TV REPORTER What do you ride?  We're filming the race for a TV series -- maybe we can use you. 
He walks to the bathroom and opens the door. 
INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Submerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub. Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The shower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over the sink. 
DUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED UP WHITE BLOTTER. 
DUKE You ate ALL THIS ACID? 
No answer. 
DUKE (turning down the volume) You evil son of a bitch.  You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble. 
GONZO Music!  Turn it up.  Put that tape on. 
DUKE What tape? 
GONZO Jefferson Airplane. "White Rabbit." I want a rising sound. 
DUKE You're doomed.  I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub. 
GONZO I dig my own graves.  Green water and the White Rabbit.  Put it on. 
DUKE OK.  But do me one last favor, will you.  Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow.  I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day. 
He switches on the tape. "WHITE RABBIT" begins to build. 
GONZO (coolly) Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off? 
DUKE How about a check? 
GONZO Whatever's right. 
DUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and leaves, closing the door behind him. 
INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
DUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted. Suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom. 
GONZO (V/O) Help!  You bastard!  I need help! 
DUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering. 
DUKE Shit, he's killing himself! 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
DUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio with the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its mounts. 
GONZO (snarling) I want that fucking radio! 
DUKE GRABS THE RADIO. 
DUKE Don't touch it!  Get back in that tub! 
GONZO Back the tape up.  I need it again! Let it roll!  Just as high as the fucker can go!  And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME! 
DUKE stares down at GONZO. 
DUKE Not me.  It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it! 
GONZO BULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this. 
HIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE. 
DUKE Jesus. 
GONZO Do it!  I want to get HIGHER! 
DUKE considers this.  He's had enough. 
INT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Still in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty. 
DUKE (V/O) I decided to eat only half at first. Good thinking.  But I spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red Pendleton shirt. 
DUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in slow-motion. 
MUSICIAN What's the trouble? 
DUKE (also in slow-motion) Well, all this white stuff on my sleeve is LSD. 
The MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A long pause. 
Cut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean- cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror. We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side... sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room. 
DUKE (V/O) With a bit of luck his life was ruined -- forever thinking that just behind some narrow door in all his favorite bars, men in red Pendleton shirts are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never know. 
INT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT 
The STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking lost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a TV white noise snowstorm. 
INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
DUKE sits staring at the TV. 
DUKE (V/O) Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. (he gets up, pours himself a drink) Has it been five years?  Six?  It seems like a lifetime -- the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of.  But no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world.  Whatever it meant. 
DUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in. 
EXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE 
We are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN. 
DUKE (V/O) THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION, AT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE SPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT, THAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I THINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T NEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY prevail.  We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave... 
DUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. 
DUKE (V/O) So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark -- that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back. 
The memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas. Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi shouting "WOODSTOCK ÜBER ALLES!" 
INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
DUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again. 
INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN 
A harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking like shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay. 
DUKE (V/O) The decision to flee came suddenly. Or maybe not. 
DUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile. 
BELL BOY Room service! 
The BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES. 
DUKE (V/O) Maybe I'd planned it all along -- subconsciously waiting for the right moment.  The bill was a factor, I think.  Because I had no money to pay for it. 
DUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING. 
DUKE (V/O) Our room service tabs had been running somewhere between $29 and $36 per hour, for forty-eight consecutive hours.  Incredible. How could it happen? 
DUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED LUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room -- empty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed... 
DUKE (V/O) But by the time I asked this question, there was no one around to answer. 
DUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside. 
DUKE (V/O) My attorney was gone.  He must have sensed trouble. 
CLERK What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles.  When we knew he was right here in the hotel. 
DUKE You did the right thing.  Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo. 
CLERK Tell me.  When will the doctor be awake? 
DUKE (tenses) Awake?  What do you mean? 
DUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer. 
CLERK (uncomfortably) Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him.  Nothing unusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand. 
DUKE Of course.  But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast.  He's a very crude man. 
DUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK. 
CLERK But he will be available?  Perhaps later this morning? 
DUKE Look.  That telegram was all scrambled.  It was actually from Thompson, not to him.  Western Union must have gotten the names reversed.  I have to get going.  I have to get out to the track. 
CLERK There's no hurry!  The race is over! 
DUKE (taking off) Not for me. 
He waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away. 
CLERK Let's have lunch! 
DUKE Righto! 
EXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY 
DUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas. 
A "YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS" sign flashes past. 
Bob Dylan plays: "Memphis Blues Again -- "Aaww, Mama, can this really by the end...?" 
A sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles. 
DUKE (V/O) Jesus, bad waves of paranoia, madness, fear and loathing -- intolerable vibrations in this place.  Get out!  The weasels were closing in.  I could smell the ugly brutes.  Flee! 
DUKE drives fast. 
DUKE Do me one last favor Lord: just give me five more high-speed hours before you bring the hammer down; just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off of this horrible desert. 
A sign flashes "YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE." 
A patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing. 
DUKE (CONT'D) You evil bastard!  This is your work!  You'd better take care of me, Lord... because if you don't you're going to have me on your hands. 
The patrol car screams after the RED SHARK. 
DUKE (V/O) Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a Highway Traffic Cop.  Your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side.  This is wrong. 
DUKE floors the gas pedal. 
DUKE (V/O) It arouses contempt in the cop heart. 
THE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY. 
DUKE (V/O) Make the bastard chase you.  He will follow.  But he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you're about to turn right. 
DUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph. 
DUKE (V/O) This is to let him know you're looking for a proper place to pull off and talk. 
AN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25. 
DUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes. 
DUKE They've nailed me!  I'm trapped in some stinking desert crossroads called Baker.  I don't have much time.  The fuckers are closing in. They'll hunt me down like a beast! 
INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY 
GONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican Day of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons. 
GONZO Who?  You sound a little paranoid. 
EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY 
DUKE screams -- sweat pouring. 
DUKE You bastard!  I need a lawyer immediately! 
INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY 
GONZO What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram? 
EXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY 
DUKE What?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in trouble.  You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that?  When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred! 
INT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY 
GONZO You're supposed to be in Vegas.  We have a suite at the Flamingo.  I was just about to leave for the airport. 
INT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY 
DUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket. 
GONZO'S VOICE You brainless scumbag!  You're supposed to be covering the National District Attorney's conference!  I made all the reservations... rented a white Cadillac convertible... the whole thing is arranged!  What the hell are you doing out there in the middle of the fucking desert? 
DUKE stares at the telegram. 
DUKE Never mind.  It's all a big joke. I'm actually sitting beside the pool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking from a portable phone.  Some dwarf brought it out from the casino.  I have total credit!  Can you grasp that? (shouts) Don't come anywhere near this place! Foreigners aren't welcome here! 
DUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone. 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
C/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun. 
DUKE (V/O) Well.  This is how the world works. 
C/U An IGUANA basks in the sun. 
DUKE (V/O) All energy flows according to the whims of the Great Magnet. 
C/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert dirt. 
DUKE (V/O) What a fool I was to defy Him. 
The IGUANA sits unfazed. 
DUKE (V/O) Never cross the Great Magnet.  I understood this now... (another blast from the gun) ... and with understanding came a sense of almost terminal relief. 
DUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the thuds of the explosions echo away. 
EXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY 
The RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas. 
DUKE (V/O) I had to get rid of The Shark.  Too many people might recognize it... ...especially the Vegas Police. (tight C/U of DUKE) Luckily, my credit card was still technically valid. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
DUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE WHITE WHALE. 
DUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top. 
DUKE (V/O) This was a superior machine -- ten grand worth of gimmicks and high price special effects.  The rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamited pond.  The dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters that I would never understand. 
DUKE You degenerate pig! 
GONZO It can't be helped.  This is Lucy. (laughing distractedly) You know--like "Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds." 
LUCY eyes DUKE venomously. 
GONZO Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit! Remember what happened at the airport!  No more of that, okay? 
LUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his arm round her shoulder. 
GONZO Lucy... this is my client.  This is Mr. Duke, the famous journalist. He's paying for this suite, Lucy. He's on our side. 
DUKE flops onto the sofa. 
GONZO Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves artists. 
DUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of artwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face. 
GONZO Lucy paints portraits of Barbra Streisand. 
LUCY I drew these from TV. 
GONZO Fantastic.  She came all the way down here from Montana just to give these portraits to Barbra.  We're going over to the Americana Hotel tonight to meet her backstage... 
DUKE's voice rises above GONZO. 
DUKE (V/O) I desperately needed peace, rest, sanctuary.  I hadn't counted on this.  Finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship. 
DUKE Well, I guess they brought the car round by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF OUT OF THE TRUNK. 
DUKE fixes GONZO hard. 
GONZO Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF. (to LUCY) Now, we'll be right back.  Don't answer the phone if it rings. 
LUCY (makes one-fingered Jesus freak sign) God bless. 
INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY 
DUKE collars GONZO -- serious. 
DUKE WELL?  What are your plans? 
GONZO Plans? 
DUKE Lucy. 
GONZO (struggling to focus) Shit.  I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. (he shrugs) You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink. 
DUKE Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention. 
GONZO stares uneasily at DUKE. 
GONZO Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months.  It's terrible. 
DUKE She's perfect for this gig.  These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her.  We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own. 
GONZO's face twitches badly. 
GONZO Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff. 
DUKE It's straight economics.  This girl is a god-send.  Shit, she can make us a grand a day. 
GONZO NO!  Stop talking like that. 
DUKE I figure she can do about four at a time.  Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day.  Maybe three. 
GONZO You filthy bastard.  I should cave your fucking head in. 
DUKE In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member. 
GONZO starts crying. 
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (crackling and booming over the lousy sound system) On behalf of the prosecuting attorneys of this county, I welcome you to the Third National DA's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. 
The EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman type -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads: NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. "If You Don't Know, Come To Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach." 
A BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod dress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be WITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around 20 REDNECKS. 
A dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room. 
At the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A. 
GONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT, CRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge. 
GONZO (lowers his voice) I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this.  Not hundreds of them! 
DUKE They're actually nice people when you get to know them. 
GONZO Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood! 
DUKE Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited. 
GONZO This is a fucking nightmare. 
DUKE Right.  Sure as hell some dope- dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops. 
COP IN BACK SSSSHHH! 
DR. BLUMQUIST -- a "drug expert" -- takes the stage. 
DR. BLUMQUIST We must come to terms with the Drug Culture in the country... country... country... 
The sound systems echoes. 
DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D) The reefer butt is called a "roach," because it resembles a cockroach... cockroach... cockroach... 
GONZO (whispers) What the fuck are these people talking about?  You'd have to be crazy on acid to think a joint looked like a goddamn cockroach! 
DUKE (V/O) It was clear that we had stumbled into a prehistoric gathering. 
DR. BLUMQUIST Now, there are four states of being in the cannabis, or marijuana, society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and Square.  The square is seldom if ever cool.  He is not "with it," that is, he doesn't know "what's happening." But if he manages to figure it out, he moves up a notch to "hip." 
DUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief. 
DR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D) And if he can bring himself to approve of what is happening, he becomes "groovy." After that, with much luck and perseverance, he can rise to the rank of "cool." A cool guy... cool guy... cool guy... 
COP IN BACK Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the anthropologist, Margaret Mead's strange behavior of late might possibly be explained by a private marijuana addiction? 
DR. BLUMQUIST I really don't know, but at her age, if she did smoke grass, she'd have one hell of a trip! 
Roars of laughter. 
GONZO I know a hell of a lot better ways to waste my time than listening to this bullshit. 
He stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and plunges down the aisle to the door. 
COP IN BACK Down in front! 
GONZO Fuck you!  I have to get out!  I don't belong here! 
COP IN BACK Good riddance! 
He stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to the stage. 
The lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER MADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk. 
FILM NARRATOR KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE MAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be able to see his eyes because of Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will be white from inner tension... 
DUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF who necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him. 
FILM NARRATOR ... and his pants will be crusted with semen from constantly jacking off when he can't find a rape victim... 
DUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness, he gets up, hand over mouth. 
DA Veterans?!!!? 
Agog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes the glass -- faster and faster... 
GONZO Yeh.  The big guy used to be a major in the Marines. 
DA A major! 
GONZO We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house. 
DA Naw!  Not a major. 
GONZO He wanted the pineal gland. 
DA Really? 
GONZO That's how he got so big.  When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy. 
DUKE Usually, it's whole families. During the night.  Most of them don't even wake up until they feel their heads going -- and then, of course, it's too late. 
The glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand. 
DUKE (CONT'D) Happens every day. 
DUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile. 
DUKE (CONT'D) Three more rums.  Plenty of ice. Maybe a handful of lime chunks. 
WAITRESS Are you guys with the police convention upstairs? 
DA We sure are, Miss. 
WAITRESS I thought so.  I never heard that kind of talk around here before. Jesus Christ!  How do you guys stand that kind of work? 
GONZO (grinning) We like it.  It's groovy. 
The WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO. 
DUKE What's wrong with you?  Hell, somebody has to do it. 
GONZO Hurry up with those drinks.  We're thirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine a Bloody Mary. 
DA (whacks his fist on the bar) Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later.  Mostly Atlanta.  But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance.  They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe. 
GONZO (with a conspiratorial nod) You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum. 
DA What do you mean by that? 
GONZO You know what I mean.  We've done it before and we can damn well do it again! 
DUKE Cut their goddamn heads off.  Every one of them.  That's what we're doing in California. 
DA (stupefied) WHAT? 
GONZO Sure.  It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line. 
DUKE We keep it quiet.  It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs.  Not with the press around. 
DA (recovering slightly) Hell, no.  We'd never hear the goddamn end of it. 
DUKE Dobermans don't talk. 
DA What? 
GONZO Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps. 
DUKE They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs. 
DA God almighty! (muttering in a daze) I don't think I should tell my wife about this.  She'd never understand. You know how women are. 
DUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back. 
GONZO She really flipped over you.  The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself. (laughing again) I guess she figures you won.  That phone message wasn't for me, was it? 
A look of stunned realization from DUKE... 
INT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY 
LUCY is on the witness stand. 
LUCY Yessir, those two men in the dock are the ones who gave me the LSD and took me to the hotel. 
A doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate. 
LUCY I don't know for sure what they done to me, but I remember it was horrible. 
JUDGE Twenty years... and Double Castration! 
The JUDGE bangs his gavel. 
INT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY 
DUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase. 
GONZO Wait!  You can't leave me alone in this snake pit.  This room is in my name. 
DUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried. 
GONZO OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her.  I'll get her off our backs. You're right.  She's my problem. 
DUKE It's gone too far. 
GONZO Relax.  Let me handle this. (dials the PHONE, snaps angrily at DUKE) You'd make a piss-poor lawyer. ...Room 1600, please. (to DUKE) As your attorney, I advise you not to worry. (nods towards bathroom) Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit. 
DUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a label: "DRINK ME." 
DUKE What is this? 
GONZO You won't need much.  Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome. 
DUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle. 
DUKE Adrenochrome... 
GONZO (into PHONE) Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got your message...what?  Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out... 
DUKE (V/O) I remember thinking, "Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid." 
DUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies it -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE... 
GONZO (to PHONE) But here's the problem.  That bastard cashed a bad check downstairs and gave you as a reference.  They'll be looking for both of you.  Yeah, I know, but you can't judge a book by its cover, Lucy.  Some people are just basically rotten... Anyway, the last thing you want to do is call this hotel again; they'll trace the call and put you straight behind bars... no, I'm moving to the Tropicana right away.  I have to go, they've got the phone tapped. Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but it's all over now... OH MY GOD! THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN! (throws the PHONE down; shouts) No!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent! It was Duke!  I swear to God! (MORE) 
GONZO (CONT'D) (stomps the PHONE; moans) No, I don't know where she is. You'll never catch Lucy!  She's gone!  I swear, I don't know where she is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME! (slams the PHONE down) 
GONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. 
GONZO Well.  That's that.  She's probably stuffing herself down the incinerator about now.  That's the last we should be hearing from Lucy. (fumbling with the hash pipe) Where's the opium? 
DUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM... 
DUKE (V/O) I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies.  But the room was quiet again. 
DUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE. 
DUKE Where'd you get this? 
GONZO Never mind, it's absolutely pure. 
DUKE Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body! 
GONZO turns to smile at DUKE. 
GONZO I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me.  He's one of these Satanism freaks.  He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life. (laughs -- struts round DUKE -- eyes bright with expectation) I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on. 
INT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 
Darkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- "Put the lime in the coconut and mix em all up..." 
DUKE (V/O) What kind of rat-bastard psychotic would play that song -- right now, at this moment? 
DUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies, awkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been there days -- months. 
DUKE (V/O) When I came to the general back alley ambiance of the suite was so rotten, so incredibly foul.  How long had I been lying there?  Hours? Days?  Months?  All these signs of violence.  What had happened? 
DUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving whisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere, pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered on a shattered mirror. 
DUKE (V/O) There was evidence in this room of excessive consumption of almost every type of drug known to civilized man since 1544 AD. 
DUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet -- HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape. 
DUKE (V/O) But what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds?  Would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries?  These puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau?  Maybe so, but then why all this booze?  And these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a hard yellow crust... 
DUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires. 
DUKE (V/O) These were not the hoof prints of your normal god-fearing junkie.  It was too savage, too aggressive. 
QUICK FLASHBACK: 
GONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER: 
BACK IN THE ROOM: 
DUKE stares at the smashed mirror. 
DUKE (V/O) Grim memories and bad flashbacks. 
In the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN VOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS. 
DUKE unzips and pisses.  THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE MAGNUM .357! 
DUKE (V/O) Something ugly had happened.  I was sure of it... 
DUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN. 
The SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door. 
DUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out of the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF... sleeping on the sofa. 
The ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock. 
A hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is muffling her screams with an ice bag. 
MAID Please... please... I'm only the maid.  I didn't mean nothin!... 
DUKE (jumps up from the bed, flashing his press badge) YOU'RE UNDER ARREST! 
GONZO (to DUKE) She must have used a pass key.  I was polishing my shoes in the closet when I noticed her sneaking in-so I took her. 
DUKE shakes his head. 
DUKE (barks at the MAID) What made you do it?  Who paid you off? 
MAID Nobody.  I'm the maid! 
GONZO You're lying!  You were after the evidence.  Who put you up to this -- the manager? 
MAID I don't know what you're talking about! 
GONZO Bullshit!  You're just as much a part of it as they are! 
MAID Part of what? 
DUKE The dope ring.  You must know what's going on in this hotel.  Why do you think we're here? 
MAID (blubbering) I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention.  I swear!  All I wanted to do was clean up the room.  I don't know anything about dope! 
The trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS. 
DUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut! 
A GASP from the surly SHOPPERS. 
DUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat flies everywhere. 
SHOPPER #1 Hey!  Is that your car? 
DUKE Sure is. 
SMASH!  Coconut fragments fly. 
DUKE Any of you folks want the milk? We're after the meat.  This is honest coconut essence.  Real meat. 
SMASH! 
SHOPPER #2 Meat, hell!  Look what you're doing to that car! 
GONZO Fuck the car.  They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio. 
SMASH! 
DUKE Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry! 
SHOPPER #3 Someone should stop them! 
SMASH! 
DUKE You poor fools don't understand, do you?  This car is the property of the World Bank!  That money goes to ITALY! 
SHOPPER #3 Somebody should call the police! 
GONZO Police?  Are you people crazy? 
GONZO confronts the CROWD, hammer in one hand, a coconut in the other. 
GONZO (CONT'D) You folks every heard of ole Patrick Henry?  Know what he said?! 
Silence -- the CROWD uncomprehending of this STONE DEGENERATE. 
GONZO (CONT'D) (ROARS) GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH! 
GONZO brings the hammer down on the hood.  CLANG! 
A gasp from the CROWD.  Getting ugly. 
GONZO (CONT'D) In Samoa we LOVE THE CONSTITUTION! 
SHOPPER #3 Bullshit. 
The CROWD move in. 
SHOPPER #1 Call the goddamn police! 
GONZO SWINGS THE HAMMER.  CLANG! 
SHOPPER #4 Look what they've done to that beautiful car! 
DUKE jumps in behind the wheel. 
DUKE This crowd is not rational.  They can't relate to us.  Let's go! 
A final CLANG!  GONZO jumps in. 
DUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD. 
DUKE You people voted for Hubert Humphrey! You killed Jesus! 
They swerve round and through the CROWD. 
GONZO What are you doing?  You were supposed to turn back there! 
DUKE (V/O) We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help.  The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it. 
DUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. 
GONZO Jesus Christ!!! 
There, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her paintings under her arm -- looking lost.  SHE LOOKS UP WITH A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION... 
DUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS OFF. 
EXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY 
THE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.  GONZO looks wildly around. 
GONZO Goddamnit!  We're lost!  What are we doing out here on this godforsaken road? 
GONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT RUNWAY. 
GONZO The airport is over there! 
DUKE Never missed a plane yet. 
DUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING, HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the RUNWAY. 
GONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He throws a worried look at DUKE. 
DUKE I'll drop you right next to the plane. 
They SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET ENGINE SCREAM. 
GONZO No!  I can't get out!  They'll crucify me.  I'll have to take the blame! 
DUKE (irritatedly) Ridiculous!  Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up.  You never saw me before.  Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles.  I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate.  You ready? 
GONZO Why not?  But for Christ's sake, just do it fast! 
EXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY 
DUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE. 
DUKE watches him go -- RELENTS. 
DUKE Hey! 
GONZO stops -- turns. 
DUKE Don't take any guff from those swine.  Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People. 
GONZO Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once... 
GONZO pauses. 
GONZO Probably good advice, if you have shit for brains. 
GONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS. 
DUKE (V/O) There he goes -- one of God's own prototypes -- a high powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production.  Too weird to live and too rare to die. 
DUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND.

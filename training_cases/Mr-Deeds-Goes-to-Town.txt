MR DEEDS GOES TO TOWN 
Written by Robert previous hit Riskin 
based on a story by Clarence Budington Kelland 
FADE IN 
EXTERIOR - MONTAGE 
1. Quick shots of a car speeding around curves in a mountainous region. The car jumps a bridge, hurtles into space, crashes in a fireball. Followed by newsboys hawking special editions, people on streetcorners buying and reading newspapers with a succession of banner headlines: 
"MARTIN W. SEMPLE, FINANCIER, DIES IN ITALY," 
"CIVIC LEADER KILLED IN AUTO ACCIDENT," 
"DISCLOSURE OF BANKER'S WILL AWAITED" and finally "SEMPLE HEIR AS YET UNKNOWN" 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INTERIOR - EDITOR'S OFFICE, DAILY MAIL 
2. CLOSE SHOT 
of Mac, the editor, at his desk, barking into the telephone. 
MAC 
Say listen, Corny, who do you think you're talking to? If the Semple attorneys don't know who the heir is, who does? 
(listens) 
Aw, come on Corny, I've done you a lot of favors. What do you say - who's getting the Semple dough? 
CUT TO: 
INTERIOR - CEDAR'S PRIVATE OFFICE 
3. CLOSE SHOT 
Of Cornelius Cobb - a hardened ex-newspaperman, customarily impatient, grouchy and nervous - victim of the New York tempo. His friends call him "Corny." 
COBB 
(on the phone) 
You're asking the wrong guy, Mac. I'm only a press agent. 
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK GRADUALLY TO REVEAL a plush law office, leather chairs and shelves of books. Arthur Cedar, attorney, briskly enters scene and seats himself at his desk. Cedar is in the neighborhood of fifty - grey-templed - dignified - sharp. Cobb is using the phone on his desk. Cedar glances at him. 
CEDAR 
Newspaperman? 
COBB 
(covering mouthpiece - confidentially) 
Wants to know who the heir is. 
CEDAR 
(firmly) 
Hang up. 
COBB 
(returning to the phone) 
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney 
CEDAR 
(more firmly) 
Hang up. 
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK FURTHER TO REVEAL another attorney at one end of the desk, reviewing a pile of papers. 
COBB 
(continuing) 
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days. 
(hangs up the phone) 
Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers. 
CEDAR 
(barely glancing up) 
I'm not interested in the newspapers. 
COBB 
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks. 
CEDAR 
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him. 
COBB 
(resignedly) 
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in. 
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A FULL SHOT as two men rush in with a flurry of excitement. One of them is Anderson, an obsequious employee of Cedar's. With him is another lawyer, one of the Cedar brothers. 
ANDERSON 
We located him, Mr. Cedar! We found out where he is. 
CEDAR 
Good! 
FIRST BROTHER 
Yes, John, we got him. 
ANDERSON 
Here's the report: Longfellow Deeds, single, 28, lives in Mandrake Falls, Vermont. 
CEDAR 
(glancing at the report) 
Thank heaven. 
FIRST BROTHER 
Better wire him right away, John. 
CEDAR 
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb. 
He pushes a button on the intercom. 
VOICE 
Yes? 
CEDAR 
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont. 
VOICE 
(skeptically) 
Where? 
CEDAR 
Mandrake Falls. 
(begins to spell as scene fades) 
M-A-N 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A STATION 
4. MEDIUM SHOT 
It is a pleasantly rural scene - with just a handful of local characters scattered about. At one end of the platform - some mail - newspapers - and a few pieces of freight are being loaded. Cedar, Cobb and Anderson stand in front of a welcome sign. The three obviously are out of their element here - obviously "City folks." 
Over their shoulders. We hear Cobb's voice as he reads: 
COBB'S VOICE 
Welcome to Mandrake Falls - 
Where the scenery enthralls - 
Where no hardship e'er befalls - 
Welcome to Mandrake Falls. 
5. MEDIUM SHOT 
Cobb and Cedar exchange glances. 
COBB 
That's pretty. 
CEDAR 
Are you sure this is the town he lives in? 
ANDERSON 
Yes sir, Mr. Cedar. This is the town all right. 
CEDAR 
Well, I dropped everything at the office - I hope it's not a wild goose chase. 
ANDERSON 
No, sir. We checked it thoroughly. He lives here all right. 
COBB 
Ah! I spy a native. Let's ask him. 
CAMERA MOVES WITH THEM as they cross to a small, one-story old brick building, covered with ivy. This is the ticket and freight office combined. In front of it is a very old man, a stoop- 
shouldered rail agent with a face of a million wrinkles - puttering around some packages. 
CEDAR 
(as they approach) 
Good morning. 
AGENT 
(glances up) 
Isn't it a lovely sentiment? 
COBB 
(flatly) 
Yeah. 
A dog enters, racing toward the door, scratching at it and whining. 
MRS. MEREDITH 
(as she heads toward the door) 
Here he is now. 
She opens the door and goes out, with the dog racing ahead. 
COBB 
(to Cedar - sotto voce) 
I suggest you break it to him gently. He's liable to keel over from the shock. 
Mrs. Meredith re-appears. We hear her voice as she comes through the doorway. 
MRS. MEREDITH 
They've been waiting a long while. 
Longfellow Deeds trails behind her. 
LONGFELLOW 
Who are they? 
MRS. MEREDITH 
I don't know. 
CEDAR 
(standing - formally) 
Mr. Longfellow Deeds? 
LONGFELLOW 
Yes. 
CEDAR 
How do you do. 
LONGFELLOW 
(shaking hands) 
How do you do. 
CEDAR 
(extending card) 
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. 
13. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP 
Featuring Cobb. He watches Longfellow who is glancing at the card. 
LONGFELLOW 
(reads to himself) 
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. 
(looks up; smiles) 
Budington must feel like an awful stranger, hmm? 
Cobb's eyes pop at the nifty.[1] 
CEDAR 
Mr. Cornelius Cobb and Mr. Anderson. 
They exchange greetings. Longfellow gestures to chairs. 
LONGFELLOW 
You gentlemen make yourselves comfortable. 
COBB AND ANDERSON 
Thanks. 
14. MEDIUM SHOT 
Longfellow crosses to his tuba near a chair. He takes a mouthpiece out of his pocket. 
LONGFELLOW 
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters. 
(he blows a note) 
What can I do for you gentlemen? 
MRS. MEREDITH 
You gentlemen going to stay for lunch? 
CEDAR 
(right to the point; ignoring her) 
I'd like to ask you a few questions. 
LONGFELLOW 
All right. 
Longfellow looks at them strangely and sits down beside his tuba. 
CEDAR 
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds? 
LONGFELLOW 
Yes. 
CEDAR 
Are your parents living? 
LONGFELLOW 
Why, no. 
CEDAR 
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you? 
LONGFELLOW 
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know. 
CEDAR 
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy. 
LONGFELLOW 
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to 
While he speaks, he has been adjusting the tuba between his legs and now sucks on the mouthpiece, preparatory to playing. 
CEDAR 
I have good news for you, sir. Mr. Semple left a large fortune when he died. He left it all to you, Mr. Deeds. Deducting the taxes, it amounts to something in the neighborhood of $20,000,000. 
15. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW 
His lips are over the mouthpiece of the tuba. His only reaction to the startling news is to lift his eyes in Cedar's direction. 
16. GROUP SHOT 
MRS. MEREDITH 
How about lunch? Are the gentlemen going to stay - or not? 
LONGFELLOW 
Of course they're going to stay. 
(to the gentlemen) 
She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top? 
(to Mrs. Meredith) 
Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel. 
Mrs. Meredith leaves. Cobb and Cedar have watched this by-play, open-mouthed, and are now even more astounded to see Longfellow blow into his tuba. 
17. CLOSER SHOT - THE THREE 
CEDAR 
(over the noise of the tuba) 
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! $20,000,000! 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. $20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it? 
COBB 
Oh, it'll do in a pinch. 
LONGFELLOW 
(impressed) 
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it. 
He resumes his 'Oom-pahs.' 
18. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND COBB 
Staring, unbelievingly. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AN ALCOVE 
19. FULL SHOT 
The three men sit around a table, having lunch. By Longfellow's side is, as expected, the tuba. 
CEDAR 
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer. 
LONGFELLOW 
Of train approaching. 
27. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND COBB 
The band has already begun and is now in the midst of "For He's A Jolly Good Fellow." 
At this moment, as he looks off, a startled expression comes into Cobb's eyes. He grabs Cedar by the arm - who glances in the direction he points. 
COBB 
Look! 
CEDAR 
What? 
COBB 
That tuba player! 
28. MEDIUM SHOT - THE BAND 
With Longfellow, in his customary position, blowing on his tuba. 
CONTINUATION SCENE 27 
Cedar and Cobb stare, wide-eyed, as the song is finished. 
COBB 
Well, now I've seen everything. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STATION 
29. LONG SHOT 
In the b.g. is the train with Longfellow standing on the observation platform, clutching his tuba. On either side of him is Cedar and Cobb. In the f.g. the crowd yells its farewell. Several of them stuff baskets of fruit into his hands. The band plays "Auld Lang Syne." 
30. CLOSE SHOT 
Over Longfellow and Cobb's shoulders. As the train begins pulling out. Longfellow smiles wanly and waves. 
LONGFELLOW 
Goodbye, Mrs. Meredith! Goodbye, Jim! Bye, Buddy! Goodbye, everybody! 
(a pause) 
Gosh, I've got a lot of friends. 
Cobb looks up into Longfellow's face - affected by the scene. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. TRAIN DRAWING ROOM 
31. FULL SHOT 
Longfellow is slumped in his seat, his legs sprawled out, his eyes ceilingward - in deep thought. Cobb sits across from him. Cedar enters, hangs up his coat, hat and cane. 
COBB 
(opening a snifter - generously) 
Have a drink? 
LONGFELLOW 
(distractedly) 
No, thanks. 
Cobb and Cedar exchange a look. 
CEDAR 
Will you have a cigar? 
LONGFELLOW 
No, thank you. 
Cedar sits down. 
CEDAR 
(breaking the silence) 
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me. 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh, I wasn't worried about that. 
CEDAR 
No? 
LONGFELLOW 
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band. 
Cobb has just finished taking a drink and can't help but nearly spit it out. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN 
32. LONG SHOT (STOCK) 
The 20th Century crossing the Harlem River. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
33. ANOTHER STOCK SHOT 
Of the 20th Century going under the street level on Park Avenue. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
34. CLOSE SHOT OF OFFICE DOOR 
Upon which we read: "CEDAR, CEDAR & BUDINGTON - ENTRANCE." CAMERA PULLS BACK to take in Cedar, who opens the door and walks through. 
INT. GENERAL OFFICE 
35. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT 
With Cedar as he strides across the room - in business-like fashion. He comes to a door marked "PRIVATE OFFICES." He pushes this door opens and disappears. 
MAN'S VOICE 
(as Cedar passes by) 
Hello, John. Where have you been? 
CEDAR 
(as he walks briskly) 
I've been fishing. 
In the background is typical office hub-bub. 
CEDAR 
(to a secretary as he passes) 
Good morning, Celia. 
SECRETARY 
Good morning, Mr. Cedar. 
A chorus of "Good Morning, Mr. Cedar!" issues from the clerks. A secretary looks up. 
INT. PRIVATE OFFICES 
36. CLOSE TRUCKING SHOT 
With Cedar - as he passes through the room - arriving at a door marked "JOHN CEDAR, PRIVATE." He goes through the door. 
INT. CEDAR'S PRIVATE OFFICES - ANTEROOM 
37. FULL SHOT 
Cedar breezes in and speaks to a secretary. 
CEDAR 
Good morning. Where are they? 
SECRETARY 
Waiting for you in the other office. 
He strides across the room to still another door marked "PRIVATE" and he disappears. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CEDAR'S PRIVATE OFFICE 
38. FULL SHOT 
A group of associates sit around in large leather chairs, as Cedar barges in. 
CEDAR 
(beaming) 
Good morning. Hello, boys. 
The men come to life. Some rise - others lean forward. Two of them are brothers of Cedar - tall and athletic. The third is a small, frightened-looking man. He is Budington. 
MEN 
(ad lib) 
Hello, John. 
What happened? 
Well, what's he like? 
CEDAR 
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child. 
BUDINGTON 
John 
CEDAR 
Close that door. 
(into dictograph) 
Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please? 
FIRST BROTHER 
Come on, John. What happened? 
CEDAR 
MAC 
Uh-huh. 
BABE 
(casually, as she starts away) 
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow. 
47. MEDIUM SHOT 
As Babe crosses to door. 
MAC 
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do? 
BABE 
(at door) 
Have lunch. 
She exits. Mac's face lights up happily. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. RESIDENCE 
48. LONG SHOT 
Of a large, imposing-looking residence. 
INT. LONGFELLOW'S BEDROOM 
49. MEDIUM SHOT 
Longfellow stands awkwardly between two tailors - who chalk and pin a suit on him. After a few seconds of silence: 
LONGFELLOW 
It's the first time I ever had a suit made on purpose. 
The tailors smile accommodatingly as CAMERA PULLS BACK and we discover that both Cedar and Cobb are present. Cobb is slumped in a chair, and Cedar is carefully putting some papers away in a portfolio. 
CEDAR 
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something. 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet. 
CEDAR 
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds. 
LONGFELLOW 
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too? 
CEDAR 
Yes. That is to say 
LONGFELLOW 
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost? 
CEDAR 
(too quickly) 
Oh - nothing. No extra charge. 
LONGFELLOW 
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it? 
CEDAR 
(generously) 
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates. 
LONGFELLOW 
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet. 
50. WIDER ANGLE 
As a butler stands in the doorway. 
BUTLER 
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir. 
LONGFELLOW 
They are? I forgot all about them. 
(to Cobb) 
What do you think they want? 
CEDAR 
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on. 
COBB 
(rising) 
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down. 
LONGFELLOW 
Thanks 
(suddenly) 
Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason? 
COBB 
Jim Mason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is. 
(reaches into his pocket and reads) 
"Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow." 
LONGFELLOW 
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur. 
COBB 
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur. 
LONGFELLOW 
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was. 
CEDAR 
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds. 
LONGFELLOW 
Huh? 
CEDAR 
I mean, about the Power of Attorney. 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh, yes. Yes, I will. 
Cobb has stalled long enough to hear Longfellow's decision before he goes out of the room. 
LONGFELLOW 
I'll give it a lot of thought. There was a fellow named Winslow here a little while ago, wanted to handle my affairs for nothing too. It puzzles me why these people all want to work for nothing. It isn't natural. So I guess I'd better think about it some more. 
51. MEDIUM SHOT 
Longfellow, Cedar and the two tailors. 
TAILOR 
That's that. 
LONGFELLOW 
You go to an awful lot of work to keep a fellow warm, don't you? 
TAILOR 
Yes, sir. 
A butler enters again. 
BUTLER 
A Mr. Hallor to see you sir. 
CEDAR 
(quickly) 
Did you say Hallor? 
BUTLER 
Yes, sir. 
CEDAR 
Well, don't let him in. 
LONGFELLOW 
Why not? Who is he? 
CEDAR 
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate. 
(to butler) 
Tell him to see me at my office. 
LONGFELLOW 
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him. 
(to butler) 
Send him in. 
The butler disappears. 
CEDAR 
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds. 
(to Cobb) 
I'm Chairman. 
COBB 
(dryly) 
Happy voyage. 
DOUGLAS 
Right here, Mr. Deeds. 
57. WIDER ANGLE 
As Longfellow is led to the president's chair. Douglas sits next to him. 
DOUGLAS 
Now, the next order of business is the reading of the Secretary's minutes . 
A VOICE 
Move we dispense with it. 
ANOTHER VOICE 
Second. 
DOUGLAS 
All in favor? 
CHORUS OF VOICES 
Aye! 
Longfellow looks his surprise. 
DOUGLAS 
I think they can be dispensed with. We're ready now for the reading of the Treasurer's report. 
A VOICE 
Move we dispense with it. 
ANOTHER VOICE 
Second. 
DOUGLAS 
All in favor? 
CHORUS OF VOICES 
Aye! 
DOUGLAS 
Quite right! Now, gentlemen, the next business will be 
58. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Featuring Longfellow, as he interrupts: 
LONGFELLOW 
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do? 
DOUGLAS 
Why, the Chairman presides at the meetings. 
LONGFELLOW 
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it. 
There is an uncomfortable shuffle. For a few minutes, no one speaks. From the rear, a tall man rises. 
59. CLOSE SHOT 
Featuring treasurer. 
TREASURER 
The treasurer reports a deficit of $180,000 for the current year. 
60. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW 
He is stunned. 
LONGFELLOW 
A deficit! You mean we've lost that much? 
61. WIDER ANGLE 
To include all at table. 
DOUGLAS 
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted for profit. 
LONGFELLOW 
It isn't? What is it conducted for? 
DOUGLAS 
Why, it's an artistic institution 
LONGFELLOW 
We own an opera house, don't we? 
A VOICE 
We do. 
LONGFELLOW 
And we give shows? 
DOUGLAS 
We provide opera. 
LONGFELLOW 
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets? 
VOICE 
Of course. 
LONGFELLOW 
And it doesn't pay? 
DOUGLAS 
That's impossible. The opera has never paid. 
LONGFELLOW 
(conclusively) 
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows. 
Cobb smiles. The directors are stumped. 
62. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Featuring Douglas and Longfellow. 
DOUGLAS 
The wrong kind! There isn't any wrong or right kind. Opera is opera! 
LONGFELLOW 
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the $180,000 coming from? 
DOUGLAS 
Well, we were rather expecting it to come from you. 
LONGFELLOW 
Me?! 
DOUGLAS 
Naturally. 
LONGFELLOW 
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that . 
He is suddenly startled. His ears prick up. 
63. SHOT OF DIRECTORS 
They all stare at Longfellow. Over scene comes the low wailing cry of a siren, which increases in volume as it gets closer to the building. 
64. MEDIUM SHOT 
Longfellow jumps up. 
LONGFELLOW 
Hey, a fire engine! 
He rushes to the window and peers out. The others stare unbelievably. The shriek of the siren finally dies down. Longfellow turns back. 
LONGFELLOW 
(admiringly) 
Gee, that was a pip![4] 
(as he goes back to his seat) 
We expect we're going to have one like that in Mandrake Falls pretty soon  with a siren, too. 
There is a pause while he gets seated. 
LONGFELLOW 
Now, where were we? 
65. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT TABLE 
DOUGLAS 
You see, Mr. Deeds, the opera is not conducted like any ordinary business. 
LONGFELLOW 
Why not? 
DOUGLAS 
Because it just isn't a business, that's all! 
Beautiful. 
LONGFELLOW 
Only common sense. 
71. MED. SHOT 
Cedar has been most uncomfortable through the scene, but now suavely assumes an admiring attitude. 
CEDAR 
(a forced smile) 
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds. 
(holds out his hand) 
Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair. 
LONGFELLOW 
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them. 
CEDAR 
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine. 
(picks up his hat) 
If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir. 
Longfellow shakes his hand. Cedar exits. Longfellow stares after him disgustedly, wiping his hands with his handkerchief. 
LONGFELLOW 
Even his hands are oily. 
Walter has entered and holds up a coat for Longfellow. 
COBB 
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment? 
LONGFELLOW 
Entertainment? 
72. CLOSE TWO SHOT 
COBB 
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender? 
LONGFELLOW 
What're you talking about? 
COBB 
Women! Ever heard of 'em? 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh. 
COBB 
Name your poison and I'll supply it. 
LONGFELLOW 
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time. 
COBB 
Okay, you're the boss. 
(as he goes) 
When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you! 
73. MED. SHOT 
As Cobb exits. Longfellow turns to Walter, the valet. 
LONGFELLOW 
He talks about women as if they were cattle. 
WALTER 
Every man to his taste, sir. 
LONGFELLOW 
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true? 
WALTER 
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time. 
LONGFELLOW 
Twenty! What did he do with them? 
WALTER 
That was something I was never able to find out, sir. 
WIPE OFF TO: 
EXT. CORRIDOR 
74. MED. SHOT 
Longfellow, exiting his bedroom, wearing a coat and hat. He comes to the top of a grand staircase, looks around slyly and sees that no one is watching. He slides down the bannister and touches the statue at the bottom for good luck. 
He starts for the door. When he gets there he finds his way barred by two husky-looking mugs. He looks up surprised. 
FIRST BODYGUARD 
Hey, you going out? 
LONGFELLOW 
Why yes. Isn't that all right? 
2ND BODYGUARD 
No. Don't ever want to go out without telling us. 
LONGFELLOW 
Who are you? 
BODYGUARDS 
We're your bodyguards. 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh, yeah. 
2ND BODYGUARD 
Yeah, Mr. Cobb said stick to your tail no matter what. 
LONGFELLOW 
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what. 
FIRST BODYGUARD 
Sorry, mister. Orders is orders. 
LONGFELLOW 
Is that so? 
2ND BODYGUARD 
Yes, sir. We gotta get you up in the morning - and we gotta put you to bed at night. 
FIRST BODYGUARD 
Only it's all right. No matter what we see - we don't see nuttin', see? 
LONGFELLOW 
(smiling) 
That's going to be fun. 
2ND BODYGUARD 
Some people like it. 
Longfellow glances around the room thoughtfully, then continues: 
LONGFELLOW 
Uh, will you do something for me before we go out? 
FIRST BODYGUARD 
Sure! 
The first bodyguard eagerly takes out a pistol. The second bodyguard slaps it away. 
2ND BODYGUARD 
(to first bodyguard) 
Put that away, slug! 
(to Longfellow) 
At your service! 
LONGFELLOW 
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me? 
2ND BODYGUARD 
Certainly. 
FIRST BODYGUARD 
With pleasure. 
The two bodyguards accommodatingly enter a closet. The moment they are gone, Longfellow closes the door calmly and turns the key. 
BODYGUARDS 
(ad-lib) 
Hey, hey! We're your bodyguards. You can't do this! 
Longfellow whistles as he exits. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE 
75. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Featuring Longfellow. 
LONGFELLOW 
(vaguely) 
That ought to be fun. 
MORROW 
Fun? Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever. 
(to someone off) 
Boy! Boy! My headpiece! 
He exits from the scene. CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. 
MORROW

Oh, Tempora! Oh, Moeraes! Oh, Bacchus![8] 
He bumps into a woman, who glares at him. 
WOMAN 
Oh, you're drunk.

Oh, you're right.

LONGFELLOW

I guess if we go with him, we'll see things, huh? 
She looks up at his face, amazed at his innocence. 
BABE 
Yes, I guess we will. 
FADE OUT: 
INT. MAC'S OFFICE 
106. MED. SHOT 
Mac is reading the story, eyes sparkling. Babe is sprawled in a chair, doing tricks with a coin. 
MAC 
(reads) 
"'I play the tuba to help me think.' This is one of the many startling statements made by Longfellow Deeds - New York's new Cinderella Man - who went out last night to prove that his uncle, the late M.W. Semple - from whom he inherited $20,000,000 - was a rank amateur in the art of 'standing the town on its cauliflower ear' . . . "[9] 
He looks up. 
MAC 
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational! 
BABE 
It took some high-powered acting, believe me. 
MAC 
Did it? 
BABE 
I was the world's sweetest ingenue. 
MAC 
Is he really that big a sap? 
107. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO 
Favoring Babe. 
BABE 
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one. 
MAC 
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this? 
BABE 
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune. 
She covers the coin with palm of other hand, and the coin disappears. But Mac is too excited to pay any attention. 
MAC 
How'd you get the picture? 
BABE 
Had the boys follow us. 
MAC 
Marvelous! 
(reads again) 
"At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'" 
(laughs) 
Beautiful! What happened after that? 
BABE 
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me. 
MAC 
When're you going to see him again? 
BABE 
Tonight, maybe. 
(looks at her watch) 
I'll phone him at noon. 
(explaining) 
Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson. 
108. MED. SHOT - THE TWO 
Favoring Mac. 
MAC 
(laughing) 
You're a genius, Babe - a genius! 
BABE 
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around. 
MAC 
(all excited) 
Good! Good! Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy. 
(starts for her) 
Babe, I could kiss you! 
109. WIDER ANGLE 
BABE 
(sidestepping) 
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay. 
MAC 
Sure. 
BABE 
With pay! 
She is out the door. 
MAC 
(yelling after her) 
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.

Walter leans over the bed violently, shaking Longfellow, who is lost in drunken sleep. 
WALTER 
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late! 
LONGFELLOW 
(without budging - without opening his eyes) 
You're Walter, aren't you? 
WALTER 
Yes, sir. 
LONGFELLOW 
I just wanted to make sure. 
111. CLOSE SHOT - WALTER 
He smiles.

If you'll permit me to say so, sir, you were out on quite a bender last night, sir.

136. CLOSE SHOT AT DESK 
As secretary's voice comes over dictograph: 
CEDAR 
Yes? 
SECRETARY'S VOICE 
Mr. and Mrs. Semple are still waiting. 
CEDAR 
(irritated) 
I can't help it. Let them wait! 
He snaps the dictograph off. 
137. MED. SHOT GROUP 
FIRST BROTHER 
Those people have been in to see me every day this week. 
2ND BROTHER 
Who are they ? 
CEDAR 
(dismissing it) 
Relatives of old man Semple. 
FIRST BROTHER 
They keep insisting they should have some nuisance value. 
CEDAR 
Nuisance value? 
FIRST BROTHER 
They say if it hadn't been for Deeds, they'd have gotten all the money. 
CEDAR 
(suddenly) 
Nuisance value. 
(thinks a minutes - crosses to door) 
Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have! 
(opens door) 
Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do? 
The others all stand around - as the Semples enter. 
MRS. SEMPLE 
We've been trying to 
138. MED. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR AND THE SEMPLES 
CEDAR 
(smoothly cutting her off) 
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting. How are you, sir? I don't know what my secretary could 
have been thinking to keep you waiting this long. 
(to one of his brothers) 
Will you bring the chairs? Quickly. Will you have a cigar, Mr. Semple? 
MR. SEMPLE 
Thanks. 
Semple takes the cigar - rather flabbergasted at all the sudden attention showered upon him.

EXT. ROOF OF TALL BUILDING - NIGHT 
139. MED. SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND BABE 
From over their shoulders, looking down on the lights and teeming activity of Times Square. 
BABE 
There's Times Square. 
LONGFELLOW 
You can almost spit on it, can't you? 
BABE 
Why don't you try? 
He does try. The wind blows it back on him. She laughs, takes out a handkerchief and wipes it off his coat. 
BABE 
(as she wipes) 
Oh! It's breezy up here. 
He doesn't say anything right away. 
BABE 
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you? 
LONGFELLOW 
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you? 
A guilty look spreads over Babe's face. 
BABE 
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know. 
LONGFELLOW 
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while? 
An awkward pause. 
BABE 
Shall we go? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - NIGHT

142. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW AND BABE 
BABE 
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal. 
LONGFELLOW 
What's that? 
BABE 
You said I was a lady in distress. 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh, that 
BABE 
What did you mean by that? 
LONGFELLOW 
Nothing 
There is a pause. 
LONGFELLOW 
Have you got a - are you - uh - engaged or anything? 
143. CLOSEUP - BABE 
The corners of her mouth go up in sympathetic amusement. 
BABE 
No. Are you? 
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE 
No. 
BABE 
You don't go out with girls very much, do you? 
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE 
I haven't. 
BABE 
Why not? 
144. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO 
Favoring Longfellow. 
LONGFELLOW 
Several feet away from her Mabel Dawson stands in front of an easel, working silently on a painting. She dabs at it and turning, pauses a moment to watch Babe, who at the moment rests her forehead on the typewriter carriage. 
MABEL 
(softly) 
What's the matter, hon? 
BABE 
(quickly) 
Nothing. 
Babe is too much absorbed to hear this. Getting no response, Mabel turns and studies her for a few seconds. 
MABEL 
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you. 
BABE 
No. It's nothing. 
MABEL 
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew. 
BABE 
(murmuring) 
Don't be ridiculous. 
She again resumes her typing. Mabel crosses to her and looks over her shoulder. 
MABEL 
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us. 
BABE 
(jumping up) 
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me. 
Babe lights a cigarette. Mabel studies her. 
MABEL 
(quietly) 
Uh-huh. I think I can tell you. 
The phone bell rings. Mabel picks it up. 
158. CLOSE SHOT AT PHONE 
MABEL

Hello . . .

Yes, she's here. Who wants her? 
(listens) 
Who?

Oh, yes. Yes, just a moment.

It's him - whatcha-ma-call-him - the "Cinderella Man." The "Cinderella Man"! 
Babe grabs the phone.

BABE 
Well, that's very nice. Thank you. 
CONTINUATION SCENE 161 
LONGFELLOW 
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem.

It's about you. 
(listens) 
Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.

Will I see you soon?

MABEL 
(knowingly) 
Uh-huh. 
BABE 
I'm crucifying him. 
MABEL 
People have been crucified before. 
BABE 
Why? Why do we have to do it? 
MABEL 
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you? 
BABE 
Yeah, then what? 
MABEL 
(shrugging) 
Search me. Ask the Gypsies. 
BABE 
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms. 
MABEL 
The guy's balmy. 
I'm just dying to see the "Cinderella Man." 
CAMERA MOVES SWIFTLY among groups of people picking out vignettes of conversation. Longfellow is the hot topic. 
A husband and a wife whispering: 
A HUSBAND 
Shh! - he may hear you. 
A WIFE 
Even if he heard you, he wouldn't understand. 
A man and a woman gossiping: 
A MAN 
I hear he still believes in Santa Claus. 
A WOMAN 
Will he be Santa Claus? That's what I want to know. 
Another man holding forth to two elegantly-dressed women: 
ANOTHER MAN 
Have you all got your slippers ready for the "Cinderella Man"? 
WOMEN

Yes, I have. 
Everybody laughs. 
FIRST WOMAN 
With $20,000,000, he doesn't have to have looks!

INT. MABEL'S BEDROOM 
168. FULL SHOT 
Babe is listlessly packing her few things in a small handbag. She slowly and meticulously folds a silken undergarment, wrapping it in tissue. Her eyes have a distant look. Mabel watches her, concerned. There is a long pause before either of them speaks. 
MABEL 
(breaking the silence) 
You're a fool, Babe. 
BABE 
I just couldn't stand seeing him again. 
MABEL 
Running away is no solution. 
169. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO 
Babe is unresponsive. 
MABEL 
(after a pause) 
What'll I tell him if he calls up? 
BABE 
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place. 
MABEL 
You're acting like a school girl. 
BABE 
(suddenly - tensely) 
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime. 
(softly) 
At least I can save him that . 
They are suddenly startled by the boisterous entrance of Bob and Frank, whose voices are heard as they barge in. 
170. MEDIUM SHOT 
Babe, not wishing to explain to them, hides her bag - and follows Mabel to greet them in the living room.

The boys cross to a table and drop their cameras. 
BOB AND FRANK 
Say, where is everybody? Come on, Babe - the artillery's ready. 
Mabel enters. Babe stands in doorway. 
MABEL 
(by way of greeting) 
It's those two sore spots again. 
BOB 
You shoulda been down to the office today, Babe. 
FRANK 
Yeah. Mac threw Cobb out again. 
BOB 
Boy, was he burning. 
FRANK 
(reaching for a bottle) 
Just one little drink - and then we're ready to shoot. 
MABEL 
(grabbing it away) 
Just a minute. No, you don't. 
BABE 
We're not going out tonight. 
BOB 
Thought you had a date with him.

Frank, Bob and Mabel. 
FRANK 
Say, what's the matter with her now 
MABEL 
You wouldn't know if I drew you a diagram. Now, run along and peddle your little tin-types. 
BOB 
What is this? Throwing us out of here's getting to be a regular habit. 
There is a knock on the door. They all look up. 
174. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR 
As Mabel opens the door slightly. We see Longfellow. Mabel's eyes open in surprise. 
LONGFELLOW 
Is Mary Dawson here? I'm Longfellow Deeds. 
175. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND FRANK 
They stand - stupefied. 
176. CLOSE SHOT - MABEL 
She waves her hand back of her, for them to hide.

Oh! Oh, yes, of course. Longfellow Deeds. Come in. Step in, please. 
177. CLOSE SHOT - BOB AND FRANK 
They duck behind the sofa, CAMERA PANNING WITH THEM. 
178. FULL SHOT 
Longfellow enters. Mabel closes the door behind him, watching him speculatively. Longfellow turns to Mabel. 
LONGFELLOW 
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you? 
MABEL 
(flustered) 
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time. 
LONGFELLOW 
Is she home? 
There is a long pause. Both lost in their own thoughts. 
LONGFELLOW 
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me. 
BABE 
No, I don't mind. 
LONGFELLOW 
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl. 
BABE 
A girl? 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl 
with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it. 
(smiling) 
She was beautiful. 
(then moodily) 
I haven't married 'cause I've been kinda waiting. You know, my mother and father were a great couple. I thought I might have the same kind of luck. I've always hoped that some day that imaginary girl would turn out to be real. 
They have arrived back at the front steps of Babe's home. 
LONGFELLOW 
Well, here we are again. 
BABE 
Yes, here we are again. 
(after a pause) 
Good night. 
LONGFELLOW

Mary - I - excuse me 
190. CLOSE TWO SHOT 
Favoring Babe. She cuts him off, her voice shaking. 
BABE 
Goodbye, darling. Don't let anybody hurt you again - ever. They can't anyway. You're much too real. You go back to Mandrake Falls. That's where you belong - goodbye!

LONGFELLOW

She stops and turns. He walks up close to her. 
192. CLOSER SHOT - THE TWO 
LONGFELLOW 
You know the poem I told you about? It's finished. 
His hand goes to his breast pocket - and then slowly is withdrawn - without bringing out the poem. 
LONGFELLOW 
Would you like to read it? It's to you. 
BABE 
(scarcely audible) 
Yes, of course. 
He now takes the poem out. The paper is folded. He hands it to her and she slowly unfolds it. Just as she is about to read Longfellow lays a hand on her arm. 
LONGFELLOW 
(a little frightened) 
You don't have to say anything, Mary. You can tell me tomorrow what you think. 
She looks into his eyes, but does not respond. Then she holds the paper up and begins reading. Longfellow watches her anxiously. 
193. CLOSEUP - BABE 
Reading softly: 
BABE 
"I tramped the earth with hopeless beat - Searching in vain for a glimpse of you. Then heaven thrust you at my very feet, A lovely angel - too lovely to woo." 
The last words come with difficulty. Babe's eyes are slowly welling up. 
194. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO 
Babe continues reading: 
BABE 
"My dream has been answered, but my life's just as bleak, 
I'm handcuffed and speechless in your presence divine - 
For my heart longs to cry out, if it only would speak, 
'I love you, my angel - be mine, be mine.' " 
Her voice is choked when she finishes. She does not look up until she refolds the paper. He stands close to her, waiting expectantly. Finally, she glances up. Her cheeks are moist, and her face clouded. Impulsively, she throws her arms around his neck, kissing him. 
BABE 
Oh, darling! 
Longfellow's arms encircle her and for a few moments they remain in an emotional embrace. 
LONGFELLOW 
(huskily) 
You don't have to say anything now. I'll wait till tomorrow - till I hear from you. 
195. CLOSEUP - BABE 
Her eyes are beset with fears. She loves him - but knows how hopeless it all is. She slowly starts freeing herself from his embrace. 
196. MED. CLOSE SHOT - THE TWO 
As Babe, weeping softly, frees herself from his embrace. 
Longfellow gives a yelp of joy and leaps down the steps. He trips over a garbage pail and bumps into passersby, making a racket as he zigzags down the street and out of scene.

As he speaks, CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal Babe near a window, peering out moodily. Mac crosses over to her side. 
MAC 
What's bothering you, huh? 
BABE 
(after a pause) 
Last night he proposed to me. 
MAC 
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him? 
BABE 
Yes. 
MAC

Why, Babe - that's terrific!

Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh?

What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he 
BABE 
(bitterly) 
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it? 
MAC 
(suddenly) 
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you? 
Babe's silence is eloquent. 
MAC 
Well, I'll be 
Longfellow watches him pityingly. 
FARMER 
Sorry. I didn't know what I was doing. 
The rest of it seems to come out of him effortfully - his voice breaking. 
FARMER 
Losing your farm after twenty years' work - seeing your kids go hungry - a game little wife saying "Everything's going to be all right."

Standing there in the bread lines. It killed me to take a handout.

I ain't used to it.

Go ahead and do what you want with me, mister.

Yes? 
FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF 
Sheriff's office. 
(shows paper) 
We've got a warrant to take you into custody. 
LONGFELLOW 
(without moving) 
A what? 
FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF 
A warrant for your arrest. You'll have to come along with us. 
Cobb enters. 
COBB 
What's up? What do you mugs want? 
FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF 
I don't know nothing, buddy. All I know is the Sheriff gives me an insanity warrant to execute. 
COBB 
Insanity! Who's says he's insane? 
They all turn to Charlie, who comes forward. 
CHARLIE 
The complainant is a relative of the late Martin Semple. The charges are that Mr. Deeds is insane and incapable of handling the Estate. 
COBB 
Oh, somebody got panic-stricken about his giving his dough away, eh? 
(to sheriff) 
Where do you think you're going to take him? 
FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF 
To the County Hospital. 
CHARLIE 
Of course, that's only temporary. A hearing will follow immediately. 
242. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW 
As he speaks quietly. 
LONGFELLOW 
That's fine. Just because I want to give this money to people who need it, they think I'm crazy. 
(cynically) 
That's marvelous. That makes everything complete. 
243. WIDER ANGLE 
To include group. 
FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF 
Let's get going! 
COBB 
Wait a minute! Not so fast. We're going to get a lawyer. I'll call Cedar. 
LONGFELLOW 
(thoroughly disillusioned) 
No, don't bother. 
CHARLIE 
As a matter of fact, I'm from Mr. Cedar's office. He represents the complainant. 
COBB 
Oh. 
Longfellow glances up at him and smiles bitterly. 
FIRST DEPUTY SHERIFF 
Well, let's go. We're wasting a lot of time. 
He goes to one side of Longfellow, and his partner to the other. They take Longfellow by the arms. He glances down casually and, suddenly, violently pushes the deputies away from him. They are thrown backward; their eyes widen in surprise. 
LONGFELLOW 
(calmly rising) 
All right, I'll go. But get your hands off me! 
244. MEDIUM SHOT 
Longfellow starts to walk forward, accompanied by Cobb - and the two deputies and Charlie fall in behind them. 
THE SHERIFFS 
(ad-lib) 
Make way! Make way! 
245. CLOSE SHOTS OF CLERKS 
To be intercut with above scene. They stare, petrified, and mumble to each other. 
246. MEDIUM SHOT 
Of the farmers and other applicants. The line has fallen out and they stand in a bunch, staring pathetically and hopelessly at the departing group. 
247. CLOSEUP OF THE FARMER 
Who stands in f.g. of bunch. What is taking place has slowly penetrated his befuddled brain. The disappointment he feared is here. His body imperceptibly sags, his eyes dim - all hope having gone out of them.

INT. CORRIDOR OF HOSPITAL 
248. MEDIUM SHOT 
A guard sits at a desk near a door, talking on the telephone. 
GUARD 
(on phone) 
Yes, most everybody in town has been here to see him. Yes, sir. I won't. Goodbye 
Babe rounds the corner quickly, heading for the door. The guard hurriedly hangs up and stands to block her. 
GUARD 
Sorry, lady 
(recognizes her) 
Oh, it's you again. 
BABE 
Oh, please! I've got to see him. 
GUARD 
Now listen, sister, for the fourteenth and last time he don't want to see nobody. 
BABE 
(pleading) 
Will you just give him my name? 
GUARD 
(confidentially) 
Listen, toots, just between us, there ain't a thing in the world the matter with that guy till I mention your name, then he goes haywire! 
Babe winces under the blow. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
249. MEDIUM SHOT 
Longfellow is seated by the far wall, peering moodily out the window. Cobb paces about. Suddenly, he wheels on Longfellow. 
COBB 
269. PANNING SHOT OF SPECTATORS 
CEDAR'S VOICE 
I have before me a series of articles written by a newspaper woman who was an eye-witness to his conduct ever since he came to New York. 
CAMERA STOPS on Babe and Mac. Cedar's voice goes on: 
CEDAR 
She tells how, in the midst of a normal conversation, he would suddenly begin playing his tuba. She tells of his attacks upon several of our eminent writers - for no apparent reason. In fact, there are many instances not recorded in these articles in which Mr. Deeds satisfied an unnatural desire to smash people up without provocation. 
270. MED. SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM 
CEDAR 
I, myself, unable to keep pace with his mental quirks, and constantly fearful of assault, turned down an opportunity to represent him as his attorney. This newspaper woman, whom we have subpoenaed to testify, tells how he tied up traffic for an hour feeding doughnuts to a poor horse. And by his own statement, waiting for that horse to ask for a cup of coffee. 
There is laughter in the courtroom - which quickly subsides when the Judge pounds his gavel. 
CEDAR 
We have photographs to substantiate this little episode, and other photographs showing Mr. Deeds jumping upon a fire engine. This scarcely sounds like the action of a man in whom the disposition of twenty million dollars may safely be entrusted. This writer of these articles - a woman whose intelligence and integrity in the newspaper world is unquestioned - held him in such contempt that she quite aptly named him "The Cinderella Man." 
271. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW 
CEDAR'S VOICE 
We have witnesses here from Mandrake Falls, his own home town, who will tell of his conduct throughout his lifetime, proving that his derangement is neither recent nor a temporary one. 
Longfellow's interest is only slightly aroused. He lifts his eyes in a casual glance around him. 
272. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Featuring Cedar. 
CEDAR 
We have others who will tell of his unusual behavior when he invited the great leaders of the musical world to his home, and then proceeded to forcibly eject them. Only recently when he was in the County Hospital for observation, he not only refused to be examined by these gentlemen, the state psychiatrists, but he actually made a violent attack upon them. 
273. CLOSE SHOT - THE JUDGE 
As Cedar continues talking, CAMERA PULLS BACK to WIDER SHOT. 
CEDAR 
In these times, with the country incapacitated by economic ailments, and endangered with an undercurrent of social unrest, the promulgation of such a weird, fantastic and impractical plan as contemplated by the defendant, is capable of fomenting a disturbance from which the country may not soon recover. It is our duty to stop it! Our government is fully aware of its difficulties and can pull itself out of its economic rut without the assistance of Mr. Deeds, or any other crackpot. 
274. MED. PANNING SHOT 
Of farmers, the Swede and others. 
CEDAR'S VOICE 
His attempted action must therefore be attributed to a diseased mind afflicted with hallucinations of grandeur, and obsessed with an insane desire to become a public benefactor. 
275. CLOSE SHOT AT FRONT OF COURTROOM 
Featuring Cedar. 
CEDAR 
(suddenly) 
Your Honor, at this time, we would like to call our first witness: Miss Louise - Babe - Bennett. 
276. FULL SHOT 
There is a mild stir, and all wait expectantly for Babe to appear. 
CLERK 
Miss Bennett, please. 
Babe, eyes on Longfellow, slowly walks to the stand. 
277. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW 
He has his face averted and doesn't look at her. 
278. MEDIUM SHOT 
Babe continues to rivet her eyes on Longfellow, as she is sworn in. 
CLERK 
Raise your right hand, please. 
She does so. 
CLERK 
Do you solemnly swear the testimony you may give before this court to be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? 
BABE 
I do. 
CLERK 
State your right name, please. 
BABE 
Louise Bennett. 
CLERK 
Take the stand. 
279. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND 
As Cedar steps up to question Babe. Judge in f.g. 
CEDAR 
Miss Bennett, are you employed by the Morning Mail? 
There is no answer. Babe continues to stare off at Longfellow, hoping he will look up. Cedar speaks to her again: 
CEDAR 
I must ask you to direct your attention to me. 
But Babe's attention remains focused on Longfellow. 
BABE 
(appealing to Judge) 
Your Honor, this is ridiculous! 
JUDGE 
Please answer the questions. 
BABE 
(wildly) 
The whole hearing's ridiculous! That man's no more insane than you are. 
The suddenness of her outbreak is startling. The Judge pounds his gavel. 
280. WIDER ANGLE - FRONT OF COURTROOM 
The Judge pounding his gavel. 
JUDGE 
Miss Bennett please! 
CEDAR 
This is outrageous! 
BABE 
(rising to stand) 
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him! 
CEDAR 
Your Honor! 
The Judge pounds his gavel throughout her speech. 
JUDGE 
(highly) 
Young lady, another outburst like that and I shall hold you in contempt! We're not interested in your opinion of the merits of this case. You're here to testify. Sit down and answer the questions. Proceed. 
Cedar beams victoriously. 
CEDAR 
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail? 
BABE 
(sharply) 
No! 
Cedar's eyes widen in surprise. There is a light stir. 
CEDAR 
(threateningly) 
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail? 
BABE 
(irritably) 
No! I resigned last week! 
281. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW 
As Cedar proceeds without interruption. 
CEDAR'S VOICE 
Well, prior to that time - were you employed by the Morning Mail? 
BABE'S VOICE 
(laconically) 
Yes. 
282. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND - BABE AND CEDAR 
CEDAR 
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds? 
BABE 
Yes. 
CEDAR 
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him? 
Since he was born. 
AMY 
Yes. Elsie Taggart was the midwife. 
JANE 
He was a seven-months baby. 
CEDAR 
Thank you, that's fine. Do you see him very often? 
The two old ladies have their whispered conference again. 
JANE 
Most every day. 
AMY 
Sometimes twice. 
JUDGE 
(irascibly) 
Must we have the echo? 
CEDAR 
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds? 
The two old ladies consult each other once more. 
JANE 
They think he's pixilated. 
AMY 
Oh yes, pixilated. 
JUDGE 
(leaning forward) 
He's what? 
CEDAR 
(concerned) 
What was that you said he was? 
JANE 
Pixilated. 
AMY 
Uh-huh. 
CEDAR 
(patiently) 
Now, that's a rather strange word to use, Miss Jane. Can you tell the court exactly what it means? 
While the two ladies go into a huddle: 
293. CLOSE SHOT - PSYCHIATRISTS 
As one of them speaks up. 
PSYCHIATRIST 
Perhaps I can explain, Your Honor. The word pixilated is an early American expression - derived from the word 'pixies,' meaning elves. They would say, 'The pixies had got him,' as we nowadays would say a man is 'balmy.' 
294. MEDIUM SHOT 
The Judge nods his understanding. The Falkner sisters nod in pleasant agreement. Cedar sighs victoriously. 
CEDAR 
Is that correct? 
JANE 
Uh-huh. 
AMY 
Uh-huh. 
JUDGE 
Now tell me, why does everyone think he's - uh - pixilated? Does he do peculiar things? 
295. MED. SHOT TOWARD WITNESS STAND 
JANE 
(after conferring with Amy) 
He walks in the rain, without his hat, and talks to himself. 
AMY 
Sometimes he whistles. 
JANE 
And sings. 
CEDAR 
Anything else? 
JANE 
Recently he gave Chuck Dillon a thumping. 
AMY 
Blacked his eye. 
CEDAR 
And why? 
JANE 
For no reason, I guess. He always does it. We always run into the house when we see him coming. 
AMY 
Never can tell what he's going to do. 
JANE 
He sure is pixilated. 
AMY 
Oh, yes - he's pixilated all right. 
CEDAR 
Thank you, ladies. That's all. 
Cedar beams. The old ladies leave to resume their seats.

WAITER 
I'm a waiter. He kept pressing me to point out the celebrities, and so help me Hannah I'm coming out of the kitchen a coupla minutes later and there he is moppin' up the floors with them. I never figured he was a guy looking for trouble.

BODYGUARD 
We was hired as his bodyguard, see? Well, the first crack out of the box, he throws us in a room and locks the door, see? Now, if a thing like that gets around in our profession, we'd get the bird - see? So I says to my partner, "Let's quit this guy, he's nuts!" 
WIPE OFF TO:

A Cockney cabman. 
CABMAN 
I'm very fond of Clara, sir. She's a nice 'orse. And when this bloke 'ere started feedin' 'er doughnuts, I yelled down to him, "Mind what you're doin' down there! Mind what you're doing'!" Of course I wouldn't mind, sir, but Clara won't eat nothin' but doughnuts, now. 
WIPE OFF TO: 
301. WIDE SHOT[13] 
Of one of the photographers (Bob) and enlarged photographs of Longfellow's antics. 
BAILIFF'S VOICE 
Come to order. 
CEDAR 
Your Honor, I wish to call your attention to these exhibits. Mr. Davis, do you recognize these reproductions? 
BOB 
Sure, they're good enlargements. Where'd you have them made? 
CEDAR 
Did you make the originals of them? 
You both concur? 
EXPERTS 
(ad-lib) 
Oh, positively. 
The Judge emerges from his consultation with his experts and addresses Longfellow. 
JUDGE 
Mr. Deeds, in view of the extensive testimony and your continued silence and upon recommendation of the doctors, the Court considers it advisable for your own safety that you be committed to an institution as prescribed by law. You need medical attention, Mr. Deeds. 
(shrugs) 
Perhaps in a little while 
Suddenly the air is rent with the shrill voice of Babe. 
BABE 
No! No! No! Wait a minute! 
All are startled and look up. Babe runs right to the Judge. 
BABE 
You can't do it! You've got to make him talk. 
CEDAR'S VOICE 
Your Honor, I object! 
She turns directly to Longfellow - leaning over close to him. 
315. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW 
BABE 
(pleading softly) 
Oh, darling, please. I know everything I've done. I know how horrible I've been. No matter what happens, if you never see me again, do this for me. 
JUDGE'S VOICE 
Miss Bennett, please! 
BABE 
(frantically) 
You said I could speak! You said I could have my say if I were rational. I'm rational. Please, let me take the witness chair. 
316. WIDER ANGLE 
BABE 
He must be made to defend himself before you arrive at a decision. 
JUDGE 
Very well. Take the stand. 
Babe goes up to the witness stand and sits down. 
BABE 
Oh, thank you! 
CEDAR 
(shouting) 
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object. 
JUDGE 
Let her speak. 
BABE 
I know why he won't defend himself! That has a bearing on the case, hasn't it? He's been hurt! He's been hurt by everybody's he met since he came here, principally by me. He's been the victim of every conniving crook in town. The newspapers pounced on him - made him a target for their feeble humor. 
317. CLOSE SHOT - BABE 
BABE 
I was smarter than the rest of them! I got closer to him so I could laugh louder. Why shouldn't he keep quiet? Every time he said anything it was twisted around to sound imbecilic. 
318. CLOSEUP - BABE 
As she continues. 
BABE 
He can thank me for it! I handed the gang a grand laugh. This is a fitting climax to my sense of humor. 
319. WIDER ANGLE 
As Cedar protests. 
CEDAR 
But Your Honor - this is preposterous! 
The Judge waves him down with a dismissing gesture of his hand. 
BABE 
Certainly I wrote those articles. I was going to get a raise - and a month's vacation! But I stopped writing them when I found out what he was all about! When I realized how real he was. 
320. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW 
As Babe's voice continues: 
BABE'S VOICE 
He could never fit in with our distorted viewpoint because he's honest and sincere - and good. If that man is crazy, Your Honor, the rest of us belong in straight-jackets. 
321. MED. SHOT 
Cedar jumps up. 
CEDAR 
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him. 
BABE 
What's that got to do with it? 
CEDAR 
(shouting) 
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you? 
BABE 
(shouting back) 
What's that got to do with it? 
CEDAR 
(louder) 
You are , aren't you? 
BABE 
(just as loud) 
Yes!!! 
322. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW 
To be intercut during her speech. At first he merely glances up at her speculatively. Finally, he begins to show some interest. 
323. MED. SHOT FRONT OF COURTROOM 
Cedar turns to the Judge. 
CEDAR 
Your Honor, her testimony is of no value. Why shouldn't she defend him? It's a tribute to American womanhood - the instinct to protect the weak. I'm not saying that nobody likes the boy. I cherish a fond affection for him myself. But that doesn't mean to say 
In the middle of his speech, Mac - the editor - appears at his elbow. 
MAC 
When the windbag here gets through, Your Honor, I'd like to verify what Miss Bennett said. I'm her editor. When she quit her job, she told me what a swell fellow this man was. And anything Babe Bennett says is okay with me. 
JUDGE 
If you have anything to say, you will take the stand. 
MAC 
I've already said it, Your Honor. I just thought I'd like to get my two cents in. 
As he starts to go, CAMERA PANNING WITH HIM, he passes Longfellow. He nudges him. 
MAC 
Don't be a sucker, pal. Stand up and speak your piece. 
He disappears to his seat. 
COBB 
Your Honor, I've got a couple of cents I'd like to put in 
JUDGE 
Sit down! 
COBB 
I've been with this man ever since he came to New York 
324. MED. SHOT 
Shooting toward the Judge. He pounds his gavel, interrupting Cobb. 
JUDGE 
Sit down! There will be no further interruptions. 
Almost simultaneously with the Judge's speech, the farmer, somewhere in the audience, rises to his feet. 
FARMER 
How about us, Mr. Deeds! 
325. MED. SHOT 
Shooting toward audience. As the farmer finishes, a dozen others are on their feet. 
CROWD 
(ad-lib) 
Yes! What about us, Mr. Deeds! 
You're not going to leave us out in the cold! 
The Judge clears his throat in embarrassment. Several women giggle. The Judge sternly pounds his gavel. 
343. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW 
LONGFELLOW 
It's likely to happen to anybody. Just the other morning I read in the paper about Mr. Cedar's own son - about how he got drunk and insisted on driving a taxi-cab, while the driver sat inside. Isn't that so, Mr. Cedar? Isn't that so , Mr. Cedar? 
344. MED. SHOT OF COURTROOM 
All eyes have turned to Cedar. 
345. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR 
His eyes are beginning to blaze angrily. 
CEDAR 
Your Honor, I object. 
JUDGE 
Proceed. 
346. MEDIUM SHOT 
LONGFELLOW 
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them? 
JUDGE 
Not at all. 
Longfellow turns. Everybody stretches to get a better look at them. 
LONGFELLOW 
Jane, who owns the house you live in? 
347. CLOSE SHOT - THE SISTERS 
The girls consult with each other. 
JANE 
Why, you own it, Longfellow. 
AMY 
Yes, you own it. 
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE 
Do you pay any rent? 
JANE 
(after conferring with Amy) 
No, we don't pay any rent. 
AMY 
Good heavens, no! We never pay rent. 
348. WIDER ANGLE 
As Longfellow continues questioning: 
LONGFELLOW 
Are you happy there? 
JANE 
Oh, yes. 
AMY 
Yes, indeed. 
LONGFELLOW 
Now, Jane, a little while ago you said I was pixilated. Do you still think so? 
JANE 
(after the usual conference) 
Why, you've always been pixilated, Longfellow. 
AMY 
Always. 
LONGFELLOW 
(smiling) 
That's fine. I guess maybe I am. 
(seriously) 
Now tell me something, Jane. Who else in Mandrake Falls is pixilated? 
Jane turns to her sister and this time they go into a prolonged huddle. It is apparently a difficult thing to figure out. Finally they come out of it. 
JANE 
Why, everybody in Mandrake Falls in pixilated - except us. 
AMY 
Uh-huh. 
349. MED. SHOT OF SPECTATORS 
There is an outburst of laughter which the Judge quickly quells with his gavel. 
350. MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE 
LONGFELLOW 
Now, just one more question. Do you see the Judge here? He's a nice man, isn't he? 
JANE & AMY 
Uh-huh. 
LONGFELLOW 
Do you think he's pixilated? 
JANE 
(quickly) 
Oh, yes. 
AMY 
Yes, indeedy. 
There is more laughter. More pounding of the judiciary gavel. 
351. CLOSE SHOT - CEDAR 
He feels his case slowly crumbling. 
352. CLOSE SHOT - BABE 
She can scarcely conceal her elation. 
353. MED. SHOT - FRONT OF COURTROOM 
JUDGE 
Mr. Deeds, you haven't yet touched upon a most important thing. This rather fantastic idea of yours to want to give away your entire fortune. It is, to say the least, most uncommon. 
LONGFELLOW 
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor. 
CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSER SHOT, featuring Longfellow and Judge, as former continues: 
LONGFELLOW 
Suppose you were living in a small town and getting along fine, and suddenly somebody dropped $20,000,000 in your lap. Supposing you discovered that all that money was messing up your life, was bringing a lot of vultures around your neck, and making you lose faith in everybody. You'd be a little worried, wouldn't you? You'd feel that you had a hot potato in your hand, and you'd want to drop it. I guess Dr. Von Holler would say you were riding on 
(points to chart) 
those bottom waves, 'cause you wanted to drop something that was burning your fingers. 
354. MEDIUM SHOT 
Cedar springs to his feet. 
CEDAR 
(shouting) 
If this man is permitted to carry out his plan, repercussions will be felt that will rock the foundations of our entire governmental system! 
The Judge has pounded him into silence. 
JUDGE 
Please, Mr. Cedar! 
(to Longfellow) 
Proceed. 
355. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT WITNESS STAND 
LONGFELLOW 
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers. 
356. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Farmers in audience, as Longfellow's voice continues: 
LONGFELLOW'S VOICE 
It's like the road out in front of my house. It's on a steep hill. Every day I watch the cars climbing up. Some go lickety-split up that hill on high 
357. FULL SHOT 
LONGFELLOW 
some have to shift into second - and some sputter and shake and slip back to the bottom again. Same cars - same gasoline - yet some make it and some don't. And I say the fellows who can make the hill on high should stop once in a while and help those who can't. 
358. MEDIUM SHOT 
LONGFELLOW 
(making his point) 
That's all I'm trying to do with this money. Help the fellows who can't make the hill on high. 
359. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW 
LONGFELLOW 
(hotly)

IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT 
Written by Robert previous hit Riskin 
based on a story by Samuel Hopkins Adams 
The HARBOR at Miami Beach fades in, providing quick views of yachts, aquaplanes, and luxurious ship-craft lying at anchor in the calm, tranquil waters of tropical Florida. This dissolves to the NAME PLATE on the side of a yacht, reading "ELSPETH II," and this in turn to a YACHT CORRIDOR where a steward is standing in front of a cabin door, near a small collapsible table upon which there is a tray of steaming food. He lifts lids and examines the contents. A heavy-set sailor stands guard near the cabin door.[1] 
STEWARD 
Fine! Fine! She ought to like this. 
(to the guard) 
Open the door. 
GUARD 
(without moving) 
Who's gonna take it in to her? You? 
STEWARD 
Oh, no. 
(turning) 
Mullison! Come on! 
The view widens to include Mullison, a waiter. His eye is decorated with a "shiner." 
MULLISON 
Not me, sir. She threw a ketchup bottle at me this morning. 
STEWARD 
Well, orders are orders! Somebody's gotta take it in. 
(he turns to someone else) 
Fredericks! 
The view moves to another waiter, who has a patch of bandage on his face. 
FREDERICKS 
Before I bring her another meal, I'll be put off the ship first. 
STEWARD'S VOICE 
Henri! 
The view moves over to a Frenchman. 
HENRI 
(vehemently) 
No, Monsieur. When I leave the Ritz you do not say I have to wait on crazy womans. 
The view moves back to include the Steward and the others grouped around him. 
ANOTHER WAITER (A COCKNEY) 
My wife was an angel compared to this one, sir. And I walked out on her . 
GUARD 
(impatiently) 
Come on! Make up your mind! 
A petty officer approaches. He is blustering and officious, but the type that is feeble and ineffective. His name is Lacey. 
LACEY 
(talking quicklystaccato) 
What's up? What's up? 
There is a fairly close picture of the GROUP featuring Lacey and the Steward. 
STEWARD 
These pigs! They're afraid to take her food in. 
LACEY 
That's ridiculous! Afraid of a mere girl! 
(he wheels on the steward) 
Why didn't you do it yourself? 
STEWARD 
(more afraid than the othersstammering) 
WhyIwell, I never thought about 
LACEY 
(shoving him aside) 
I never heard of such a thing! Afraid of a mere girl. 
(moving to the tray) 
I'll take it in myself. 
They all stand around and watch him, much relieved. He picks up the tray and starts toward the door of the cabin. 
LACEY 
(as he walksmuttering) 
Can't get a thing done unless you do it yourself. 
(as he approaches the door) 
Open the door. 
We see him at the CABIN DOOR as the guard quickly and gingerly unlocks it. 
LACEY 
Afraid of a mere girl! Ridiculous. 
Lacey stalks in bravely, the tray held majestically in front of him, while the steward and waiters form a circle around the door, waiting expectantly. There is a short pause, following which Lacey comes hurling out backwards and lands on his back, the tray of food scattering all over him. The steward quickly bangs the door shut and turns the key as the waiters stare silently. 
The scene dissolves to the MAIN DECK of the yacht, first affording a close view of a pair of well-shod masculine feet, as they pace agitatedly back and forth. Then as the scene draws back, the possessor of the pacing feet is discovered to be Alexander Andrews, immaculately groomed in yachting clothes. In front of him stands a uniformed Captain, but Andrews, brows wrinkled, deep in thought, continues his pacing. 
ANDREWS 
(murmuring to himself) 
On a hunger strike, huh? 
(a grunt) 
When'd she eat last? 
CAPTAIN 
She hasn't had a thing yesterdayor today. 
ANDREWS 
Been sending her meals in regularly? 
CAPTAIN 
Yessir. She refuses them all. 
ANDREWS 
(snappily) 
Why didn't you jam it down her throat? 
CAPTAIN 
It's not quite that simple. 
(he shakes his head) 
I've dealt with prisoners in my time, but this one 
ANDREWS 
Absurd! 
(muttering) 
All this fuss over a snip of a girl. 
(suddenly) 
I'm going down to see her myself. 
He leaves with determination, followed by the Captain, and both are then seen walking in the direction of the cabin, Andrews grim. 
CAPTAIN 
This is dangerous business, Mr. Andrews. After all, kidnapping is no child's play. 
But Andrews ignores him and merely stares grimly forward. They arrive in front of the cabin door, where Lacey is brushing himself off, and where a couple of waiters are picking up the last pieces of the broken dishes. 
(muttering) 
Most humiliating thing ever happened to me. 
(shuddering) 
A bunch of gorillas shoving me in a car! That crowd outside the justice of the peacemust have thought I was a criminalor something. 
A close view of ANDREWS intercuts with part of Ellie's speech. At the end of her speech he smacks his lips, enjoying the food with too great a relish. Then the two are seen together. 
ELLIE 
(after a pausestrongly) 
Where are you taking me? 
ANDREWS 
(carelessly) 
South America. 
ELLIE 
(aghast) 
South America! 
ANDREWS 
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard. 
ELLIE 
(threateningly) 
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat. 
ANDREWS 
(buttering bread) 
In that event, we won't need so many supplies. 
ELLIE 
(exasperated) 
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married! 
ANDREWS 
I'll get it annulled. 
ELLIE 
You'll never do it! You can't do it! 
ANDREWS 
(now seen close as he speaks between snatches of food) 
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do itif I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were. 
(he smacks his lips) 
Mmmmmm. This filet mignon is divine! 
ELLIE 
(seen with her father) 
What've you got against King Westley? 
ANDREWS 
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all. 
ELLIE 
You only met him once . 
ANDREWS 
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup? 
ELLIE 
You talk as if he were a gigoloor something. 
ANDREWS 
(risingreaching for ketchup) 
Never mindI'll get it myself. 
(he falls back in his chair) 
Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks. 
ELLIE 
(seen closer now, with Andrews) 
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan. 
ANDREWS 
You're going to finance him, I suppose. 
ELLIE 
Why not? Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business menparticularly if you're a shining example. 
He grins, not at all offended, knowing she doesn't mean it. 
ELLIE 
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing. 
ANDREWS 
(unequivocally) 
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to. 
ELLIE 
(strongly) 
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember. 
(screaming) 
I'm sick of it! 
And as Andrews ignores her, she starts moving around the table toward him.Next she appears sitting on the edge of Andrews' chair, and she throws her arm around his shoulder. 
ELLIE 
(pleading sweetly) 
Aw, listen, Dad. Let's not fight like this any more. I know you're worried about meand want me to be happy. And I love you for it. But please try to understand. You're not being fair, darling. This isn't just a crazy impulse of mine. King and I talked about it a lot before we decided to get married. Lookwhy can't we give it a triallet's sayfor a year or so. If it's wrong, King and I will be the first to know it. We can get a divorce, can't we? Now, be a dear, and let me off the boat. Keeping me prisoner like this is so silly. 
Andrews has been listening silently throughout the speech, giving no indication of his feelings in the matter. 
ANDREWS 
(unimpressed) 
You'll be set free when the marriage is annulled. 
A close-up of ELLIE, her eyes blazing angrily, shows her slowly edging away from her father, while he continues. 
ANDREWS' VOICE 
(carelessly) 
So there's no use being a stubborn idiot. 
ELLIE 
(hissing) 
I come from a long line of stubborn idiots! 
ANDREWS 
(again seen with her; calmly) 
A time will come when you'll thank me for this. 
ELLIE 
(wildly) 
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you! 
ANDREWS 
Please don't shout. 
ELLIE 
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to. 
ANDREWS 
(reaching for it) 
Okay. 
And much to her surprise, he sighs deeply and relaxes to his former position, shutting his eyes. She glares at him crushingly. 
The scene dissolves to another view of the BUS, disclosing the driver, and suddenly the bus comes to a stop. 
DRIVER 
(sticking his head in to face the passengers) 
Rest station! Ten minutes! 
The view draws back as some of the passengers rise. The men stretch their legs, and the women straighten out their skirts. A close view of Peter and Ellie then shows her rising. Peter accommodatingly shoves his feet aside for her to pass, and Ellie starts up the aisle. But she suddenly stops; looks back, first at her bag and then at Peter; decides to take her bag with her, and returns to take it. She reaches for it on the rack, Peter watching her, amused. 
The scene dissolves to the outside of the REST STATION with several passengers walking briskly back and forth. The place is dimly lit by one or two lamp-posts, and Peter can be seen leaning against one of these posts, smoking a cigarette. The scene moving in, a close view of Peter shows him stealing a glance in the direction of Ellie. And a view, from his angle, reveals Ellie in the shadow of the bus, her bag at her feet. She slowly turns her head toward Peter and then quickly averts it. 
PETER (seen close) speculates about her. He glances around the place, and the scene moves about, following his gaze. It takes in the other passengers, all obviously poor and uncultured. The moving view reaches Ellie. The contrast is perceptible. Thereupon, we see Peter reacting with comprehension: No doubt about it! She doesn't belong with these passengers. Then suddenly he sees something which startles him, and we see what it is: Directly in back of her, the young hoodlum passenger slyly lifts her overnight bag from the ground and starts running with it. Ellie is oblivious of his actions. PETER springs forward. 
Ellie sees Peter coming toward her and is perceptibly startled. But Peter whizzes by her, and this amazes her even more. She shrugs her shoulders, perplexed, and resumes her smoking. In a few seconds Peter returns, puffing breathlessly. 
PETER 
He got away. I suddenly found myself in the middle of the brush and not a sign of the skunk. 
ELLIE (seen close with PETER) doesn't know what he's talking about. She looks at him, puzzled. 
ELLIE 
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested. 
PETER 
(taken aback) 
Wellof all thewell 
(hard) 
Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone. 
At this, Ellie wheels around and stares at the spot where her bag had been. 
ELLIE 
Oh, my heavens! It's gone! 
PETER 
(sarcastically) 
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually. 
ELLIE 
What happened? 
PETER 
That cadaverous-looking yegg[2] who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run! 
ELLIE 
What am I going to do now? 
PETER 
Don't tell me your ticket was in it? 
ELLIE 
(opening her purse) 
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it. 
PETER 
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville. 
ELLIE 
Why, noI 
(catching herself) 
Yes . . . I guess I will. 
PETER 
(starting out) 
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean. 
ELLIE 
(quickly) 
No. I'd rather you didn't. 
PETER 
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name? 
ELLIE 
I don't want it reported! 
PETER 
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that 
ELLIE 
(hotly) 
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported! 
(she starts away) 
Please stay out of my affairs! I want to be left alone. 
(with which she disappears from the scene) 
A close-up of PETER shows him glaring after her. 
PETER 
(mumbling) 
Why, you ungrateful brat! 
The scene dissolves to the BUS, where all the passengers are scattering back to their seats; Peter is already seated, when Ellie arrives. A close view then shows her standing uncertainly for a moment, speculating whether to cross over his legs to get her place by the window. Peter feels her presence by his side and glances up. She tosses her head and plants herself in the seat in front of him, vacated by the young man who stole her bag. Peter takes the affront with a shrug and slides over gratefully to the coveted spot near the window. 
The scene dissolves to a close view of Ellie and a recently arrived fat man next to her. She has her head thrown back in an effort to sleep, but the fat man, his hands clasped over his protruding stomach, snores disgustingly, and the rumble of the flying bus accompanies him. Suddenly the bus careens, the fat man falls against Ellie, and she awakens with a start and pushes him back. The fat man's snoring goes on uninterrupted, and Ellie relaxes again; but in a few seconds the procedure is repeated, and Ellie is beside herself. She looks around for somewhere to flee. 
PETER, seated in back of her, in his customary slumped position, opens his eyes slightly. It is apparent he has been watching her for some time, for he grins at her discomfiture. Ellie's head turns in his direction and the grin leaves Peter's face. He shuts his eyes and pretends to be asleep. Ellie glances at Peter to make certain he is asleep. The fat man falls against her again and it is all she can stand. She starts to rise. Peter sees her coming and deliberately puts his hand on the seat next to him, still pretending to be asleep. Just as Ellie starts to sit, she notices his hand and is embarrassed. Gingerly she picks up his limp hand and places it on his knee. She then slides into the seat, sighing with relief, whereupon Peter opens his eyes and is amused. Slowly his head turnsand he scrutinizes her, soberly and appraisingly. Ellie slowly turns her head for a glimpse of Peterand is startled to find him gazing at her. She turns forward, her jaw set forbiddingly. 
The scene dissolves to the view of a ROAD. It is dawn, and in the distance, against the horizon, the bus, a mere speck, makes its lone way over the deserted country. This dissolves to a large SIGN, reading "JACKSONVILLE," and then into the BUS affording a close view of ELLIE and PETER. They are both asleep, her head resting comfortably on his shoulder, Peter's topcoat thrown over her. Then the view draws back. The bus is empty except for Ellie and Peter, the last few passengers are just leaving. 
PETER's eyes slowly open. He looks down at the head on his shoulder and grins. With a sigh, he shuts his eyes again and resumes his slumber. Next, at the front of the bus, the DRIVER stands staring at Peter and Ellie in this intimate position and his mouth twists knowingly. 
DRIVER 
(murmuring) 
Oh, yeah? 
ELLIE stirs, squirms a little uncomfortably and with a sleepy grunt shifts her position. Just as she settles down, her eyes open. She stares out of the window with unseeing eyes, and then closes them 
dreamily, giving the impression that, still half conscious, she is trying to recall where she is. Apparently she does, for her eyes suddenly snap open and she lifts her head. Finally (in a scene including Peter), Ellie realizes that she has been sleeping on his shoulder, whereupon she straightens up, embarrassed. 
ELLIE 
Oh, I'm sorry 
(feebly smiling) 
Silly, isn't it? 
She looks around, and her finding herself alone with Peter adds to her embarrassment. 
ELLIE 
Everybody's gone. 
She lifts her arms to adjust her hat and becomes conscious of his coat over her which slips. She stares at it thoughtfully for a momentthen at Peter. 
ELLIE 
(realizing that he put it there) 
Oh, thank you. 
(she hands him his coat; ill at ease) 
We're in Jacksonville, aren't we? 
PETER 
Yes. 
ELLIE 
(nervously) 
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away? 
PETER 
I hated to wake you up. 
ELLIE 
(bluffing it through) 
Will you please tell me what you're raving about! 
PETER 
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York. 
ELLIE 
You must have me confused with 
PETER 
(interrupting) 
Quit kidding! It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley. 
He pulls a newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her. Ellie glances at the headline hurriedly. 
PETER 
(while she reads) 
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony. 
ELLIE 
(looking up at him) 
I didn't ask for your advice. 
(she hands the paper back) 
PETER 
That's right. You didn't. 
ELLIE 
You're not going to notify my father, are you? 
PETER 
(looking at her squarely) 
What for? 
ELLIE 
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
(a disdainful expression crosses his face) 
PETER 
I never thought of that. 
ELLIE 
(frantically) 
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York. 
PETER 
(furious) 
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me. 
He turns his back on her and leaves. A close-up of ELLIE shows her staring after him, her eyes blazing angrily. 
In a TELEGRAPH OFFICE, Peter addresses a girl operator as he drops a telegram on the counter, which she reads. 
PETER 
(brusquely) 
You send telegrams here? 
OPERATOR 
(recognizing him apparently, sarcastically) 
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you? 
(reading) 
To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is" 
(looking up excitedly) 
No, do you really? 
PETER 
(impatiently) 
Go on. Go on send the telegram. 
OPERATOR 
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof" 
PETER 
Mush. Mush. 
OPERATOR 
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60. 
PETER 
Send it collect. 
OPERATOR 
Collect? 
Peter 
(firmly) 
Collect. 
As the clerk takes the wire from him, scene fades out. 
Part Three 
The BUS TERMINAL fades in. It is night now, and the rain comes down in torrents. People scurry around to get into the buses as the voice of an announcer is heard: 
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE 
Bus for blah-blah-blah-blahCharlestonblah-blah-blahand all points North to New York! 
This dissolves to the interior of a BUS, which is practically filled. Peter is in his seat, reading a magazine, while Ellie enters hurriedly from the rear door and starts forward. As she approaches Peter, she hesitates a second, and deliberately passes him, plunking herself into a seat in the opposite aisle. Peter turns just as she gets seated. He glances at her indifferently. 
A close view shows Ellie seated next to a man who sits reading a newspaper which covers his face. Her eyes are fixed forward, her lips set adamantly. A close-up of the MAN next to Ellie makes it plain that he is a typical drummer.[3] At the moment he is absorbed in a serial story, but suddenly he becomes aware of something at his feet, and without lowering the newspaper, his gaze slowly shifts downward. At this, the view moves down until it reaches Ellie's trim ankles. Her feet beat a regular tattoo on the floor; her extreme agitation is evident. The view moves back slowly, taking in Ellie's shapely leg as far as the knee. Then we see ELLIE and the DRUMMER as his gaze is still fixed on her leg. Slowly his face breaks into a lascivious grin, he lowers his paper, and turns for a scrutiny of her face. What he sees apparently delights him, for he drops his paper completelyand smiles broadly. 
DRUMMER 
Hi, sisterAll alone? My name's Shapeley. 
(Ellie favors him with a devastating look which is wasted on the drummer) 
Might as well get acquainted. It's gonna be a long tripgets tiresome later on. Specially for somebody like you. You look like you got class. 
(he surveys her from head to foot) 
Yessir! With a capital K. 
(he chuckles at his own sally) 
And I'm a guy that knows class when he sees it, believe you me. 
A close-up of ELLIE, as Shapeley's voice continues, shows her glancing back at Peter, expecting him to come to her rescue. 
SHAPELEY'S VOICE 
Ask any of the boys. They'll tell you. Shapeley sure knows how to pick 'em. Yessir. Shapeley's the name, and that's the way I like 'em. 
Ellie again looks toward Peter. But PETER seems to have found something of unusual interest in his magazine . . . and we again see the harassed ELLIE and the irrepressible SHAPELEY, who continues. 
SHAPELEY 
You made no mistake sitting next to me. 
(confidentially) 
Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about. 
(he pulls out a cigar, and continuesawed by the recollection) 
Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck. 
(he lights his cigar, takes a vigorous puff, and turns to her again) 
What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much. 
ELLIE 
(intending to freeze him) 
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
(this however only brings a guffaw from the drummer) 
Here, boy! 
Peter snatches the purse out of her hand and takes the money out. Ellie stares at him dumbfounded. 
PETER 
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going? 
ELLIE 
(vehemently) 
That's none of your business. 
PETER 
(with finality) 
You're on a budget from now on. 
(he flings her purse back at her and pockets the money) 
ELLIE 
Now, just a minuteyou can't 
PETER 
Shut up! 
He returns to his magazine, leaving her staring at him petulantly as the scene fades out. 
Part Four 
SOMEWHERE ON THE ROAD at night. This is apparently on the outskirts of a town. Two local policemen and our bus driver stand in the foreground near a police booth. The rain sweeps across their faces as they talk. The passengers in the bus, which stands in the background, stick their heads out, trying to hear what is going on. 
FIRST POLICEMAN 
You won't be able to pass till morning. 
SECOND POLICEMAN 
Not even then, if this keeps up. 
Peter approaches the group and is then seen with the officers and the driver. 
PETER 
What's up? 
FIRST POLICEMAN 
Bridge washed outaround Dawson. 
DRIVER 
Looks like we can't go through till morning. 
SECOND POLICEMAN 
(his only contribution) 
Not even then, if this keeps up. 
FIRST POLICEMAN 
Any of your passengers want a place to sleepthere's an auto camp up yonder a piece. 
PETER 
(interested) 
Yeah? Where? 
FIRST POLICEMAN 
(pointing) 
Up yonder. See the lights? 
PETER 
Yeah. 
FIRST POLICEMAN 
That's it. Dyke's Auto Camp. 
PETER 
Thanks. 
He dashes toward the bus. Then he appears at the side door of the bus. 
PETER 
(calling) 
Hey, Brat! 
(he is about to enter when he sees Ellie) 
The view moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step. 
ELLIE 
(haughtily) 
Are you talking to me! 
PETER 
Yeah. Come onwe're stopping here for the night. 
He disappears inside the bus through the side door. With an independent toss of her head, Ellie turns and also enters the bus, but through the rear door. 
The scene dissolves to DYKE'S AUTO CAMP. Ellie stands alone on the porch of a small bungalow, sheltered from the rain. Over her head is a sign reading: 
OFFICE-Dyke Auto Co.P. D. Dyke, Prop. 
She looks about her restlessly, giving the impression that she has been waiting for someone. Suddenly she is attracted by something and gazes in its direction. Then, as seen by Ellie in a long view, there appears, about twenty yards away, a small cabin, lighted on the inside; and from it Peter emerges accompanied by a manpresumably Mr. Dyke. We cannot hear what is being said; from their movements, however, it is apparent that an exchange of money is taking place. Dyke waves his hand in departure and starts toward Ellie. At the same time, Peter calls to her: 
PETER 
(shouting) 
Hey! Come on! We're all set. 
(saying which he enters the cabin) 
Ellie hesitates a moment, then starts toward the cabin. Now she is hurrying across the open space. En route she passes Dyke. 
DYKE 
(as they pass) 
Good evening. Hope you and your husband rest comfortably. 
Ellie keeps on running, but suddenly she stops dead and looks back at Dyke, following which a close-up of ELLIE shows her eyes opening wide with astonishment. Her impulse is to call Dyke back, to make him repeat what he saidto make certain she heard him correctly. But Dyke is gone, and she turns and glances thoughtfully in the direction of the cabin. Then slowly the corners of her mouth screw up in an attitude of cynicism. So that's it, is it! He has given her no previous evidence of being "on the make"; yet now, with the first opportunity. Her thoughts, however, are interrupted by Peter's voice: 
PETER'S VOICE 
Well, Bratwhat do you say! 
As she doesn't stir, there appears a close-up view of PETER standing in the doorway of the cabin, looking toward Ellie. 
PETER 
(impatiently) 
Come on! Come on! What are you going to do? 
Stand there all night? 
(he disappears inside) 
For a long moment, ELLIE is lost in speculation as to how to proceed. Then, tossing her head defiantly, with her lips set grimly, she starts toward the cabin until she reaches it, stops in the doorway and peers in. As she does this, there is a view of the inside of the CABIN, as seen by her at the door. Except for two cots on either side of the room, a few sticks of cane furniture, a small table upon which stands an oil burner for cooking, the place is barren. At the moment Peter is attaching a clothes line across the center of the room. His suitcase is already open. And now Ellie steps inside, surveying the place contemptuously. But Peter, with his back to her, is oblivious of her presence; and as he works, he hums his favorite melody. Ellie finally breaks the silence. 
ELLIE 
(sarcastically) 
Darn clever, these Armenians. 
PETER 
(seen close as he turns) 
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift. 
(but he finishes his hammering and turns to his suitcase) 
ELLIE 
(seen with Peter) 
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband. 
PETER 
(carelessly) 
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs. 
(the matter-of-fact way in which he says this causes her eyebrows to lift) 
ELLIE 
Oh, you did? What am I expected to doleap for joy? 
Do you mind putting out the light? 
PETER 
Not at all. 
(he leans over and snaps it off) 
The room is thrown into darkness except for a stream of light coming in the window from the night-light outside the camp. Visible are Peter's face and arms as he stares ceilingward, while on Ellie's side all we can see of her is her silhouette, except for such times as she gets in direct line with the window. There are glimpses of her as she moves around in the process of undressing, and we see, or rather sense, her dress dropping to the floor. She now stands in her chemise; this being white silk, it stands out more prominently against the darkness. She picks up the pajamas and backs into a corner, following which a close-up of her head and shoulders shows her glancing apprehensively toward Peter's side of the room; and holding the pajamas in front of her with one hand, with the other she slips the strap off her shoulders. She flings her "slip" over the blanket. 
PETER, on his side of the room, looks toward the blanket, and reacts to the "slip" coming into sight. Then other undergarments join the "slip" on the blanket. 
PETER 
(hoarsely) 
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho? 
(a pause) 
It's tough enough as it is. 
ELLIE'S VOICE 
Oh, excuse me. 
(and we see the underthings flipped off the blanket.) 
Ellie's side of the room appears, showing her crawling quickly into bed, pulling the covers over her and glancing apprehensively in Peter's directionfollowing which a close view shows PETER being very conscious of her proximity. The situation is delicate and dangerous; the room is atingle with sex. He turns his gaze toward the blanket. The view moves to the BLANKET, remaining on it a moment. It is a frail barrier. The view then moves back to Peter, whose eyes are still on the blanket, his face expressionless. A close view of ELLIE, next shows that she, too, has her eyes glued on the blanket, a little fearfully. She turns her head and gazes at the ceiling for a moment. Then suddenly her eyes widenand she sits up abruptly. 
ELLIE 
(seriously) 
Oh, by the waywhat's your name? 
PETER 
(seen close; turning his head toward her) 
What's that? 
ELLIE 
(both sides of the blanket coming into view) 
Who are you? 
PETER 
Who, me? Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face. 
ELLIE 
(interrupting) 
You've got a name, haven't you? 
PETER 
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne. 
ELLIE 
Peter Warne? I don't like it. 
PETER 
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning. 
ELLIE 
(flopping back on her pillow as she mumbles) 
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne . . . 
PETER 
The pleasure is all mine. 
There is silence between them for a few seconds. 
PETER 
I've been thinking about you. 
ELLIE'S VOICE 
Yes? 
PETER 
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed. 
Ellie doesn't like the implication, and glares in his direction as Peter's voice continues: 
PETER'S VOICE 
(meaningly) 
I'll bet you're in an awful hurry to get back to New York, aren't you? 
ELLIE 
(hard) 
Goodnight, Mr. Warne. 
(she turns over) 
PETER 
Goodnight. 
He also turns his head toward the wall, and the scene fades out. 
Part Five 
A long view of the SKY, in the early morning, fades in. In the dim distance there is a speck, which, as it comes nearer, turns out to be an airplane. The drone of its motors becomes louder and louder. Then the view cuts to the CONTROL COCKPIT of the PLANE revealing TWO PILOTS. 
FIRST PILOT 
(shouting to other) 
The old man's screwy! 
SECOND PILOT 
(who can't hear him) 
What's 'at? 
FIRST PILOT 
(louder) 
I said, the old man's screwy! 
SECOND PILOT 
(nodding his head in agreement) 
Yeah! 
FIRST PILOT 
(cupping his mouth) 
The dame's too smart for him. 
SECOND PILOT 
(nodding again, then leaning over) 
How'd you like to be married to a wild cat like that? 
The First Pilot grimaces in disgust, grabs his nose between his fingers, and goes through the motion of ducking under water. And as they both laugh, the scene cuts to the CABIN of the plane, a privately built plane which has all the equipment of a passenger ship. Andrews and one of his secretaries, a conservative-appearing man of middle age, lean over a table. This being a closed cabin, the roar of the motors scarcely interferes with the dialogue. 
SECRETARY 
Here's another wire, sir. This one's from Charleston. 
(as there is a close view of the two) 
"Checking every northbound train. Also assigned twenty operatives to watch main highways. No success yet. Will continue to do everything possible." Signed: Lovington Detective Agency, Charleston. 
ANDREWS 
Any others? 
SECRETARY 
Yessir. 
(holding up stack of wires) 
There's a report here from every State along the East coast. Want to hear them? 
ANDREWS 
(impatiently) 
What do they say? 
SECRETARY 
They're practically all the same, sir. 
(he shrugs his shoulders to indicate there is no news) 
(dignifiedly) 
Where'd you say the showersand thingswere? 
(Peter turns; when he sees her he laughs) 
PETER 
(appraisingly) 
Heyyou're little, aren't you? 
ELLIE 
Where is the shower? 
PETER 
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it. 
ELLIE 
(leaving haughtily) 
I'll find it myself. 
She slams the door viciously, but Peter rushes over to the window to watch her; and as viewed by him, Ellie appears next walking to the showers outside the cabin. She holds her head high and struggles valiantly to maintain as much dignity as she can muster under the circumstances. Then in the cabin, at the window, Peter watching Ellie, chuckles at her, shaking his head in amusement. He starts toward the table, and the scene cuts to a moving view outside 
the cabins, with Ellie walking past several cottages on her way to the showers. Several people stop to stare at her until she reaches her destination. There are two wooden shacks adjoining, each having a sign on them; one reads, "ShowersMen"the other, "ShowersWomen." In front of the women's shower there are several unappetizing-looking fat women waiting, and with them is a small girl. Ellie crosses over to the women's shower and disappears inside, the waiting women staring at her, puzzled. A moment elapses and Ellie backs out, being pushed by a woman, part of whose naked body is visible, and whose voice is heard in protest: 
WOMAN 
Can't a body have some privacy around here? 
The women who are waiting chuckle at Ellie's embarrassment as she stands aside. They certainly are making a monkey out of her decorum. The little girl keeps eyeing Ellie, fascinated. 
LITTLE GIRL 
(pointing) 
Don't she look funny, Mama? 
Ellie, wheeling on the little girl, crushes her with a devastating look, so that the little girl cringes against her mother's skirt. Ellie goes to the end of the line to await her turn, following which close-ups show the LITTLE GIRL slowly turning her head to look at Ellie, and ELLIE noticing the little girl staring at her, whereupon Ellie sticks her tongue out at her. And, in a scene which includes both, the little girl retaliates by sticking her tongue out also. 
This dissolves to a view of ELLIE coming out of the showers. At the same time Shapeley comes out of the men's shower, and upon seeing Ellie, his face lights up. 
SHAPELEY 
Hello, sister. 
Ellie ignores him, and walks toward her cabin. But Shapeley falls into step with her. 
SHAPELEY 
Sorry about last night. Didn't know you were married to that guy. Shoulda told me about it right off. 
(he chuckles) 
There I was, gettin' myself all primed for a killin', and you turn out to be an old married woman. 
The scene cuts to the door of PETER'S CABIN as Peter comes out, stands in the doorway, and is surprised to see Ellie and Shapeley, who are then seen (from his angle) talking. Thereupon PETER is seen again as his lip curls up a little jealously; he returns to the cabin, following which we again see Ellie and Shapeley walking. He notices the robe she is wearing, and he looks down toward her feet, the view moving down to show Ellie's legs and feet. The pajama legs are seen protruding below the robe, the cuffs of which she has turned up. Then the view moving back up to Ellie and Shapeley, he lifts her robe playfully. 
SHAPELEY 
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir. 
ELLIE 
(stoppingher eyes blazing) 
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours. 
SHAPELEY 
(startled) 
SorryI didn't mean to 
ELLIE 
(sharply) 
Get out! 
SHAPELEY 
Okay. I was just trying to make conversation. 
Ellie leaves him abruptly, and the scene cuts to the CABIN, where Peter is now busy setting the small table. Ellie enters after a moment, while Peter has his back to the door. 
PETER 
(without turning) 
High time you got back. 
ELLIE 
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files. 
She disappears behind the blanket, following which we see Peter's side of the cabin, while Ellie's voice continues from behind the blanket. 
ELLIE'S VOICE 
We must come back to this place often. You meet the nicest people! 
Her head bobs up over the blanket now and again as she dresses. 
ELLIE 
I saw the little Pussinfoos girl. She's turned out quite a charming creature. 
Peter ignores her chatter, except for an annoyed glance once in a while. 
ELLIE 
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute? 
PETER 
Hurry up and get dressed. 
ELLIE 
(sticking her head over blanket) 
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends? 
PETER 
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummerwe'd have been through with breakfast by this time. 
A close view shows ELLIE in the process of buttoning her dress. She looks up, having recognized a tinge of jealousy in his voice, which intrigues her. She starts to the other side of the blanket. Then we see her joining Peter in his part of the cabin. 
ELLIE 
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to. 
PETER 
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime. 
(setting a plate for her) 
Come on, sit down. 
ELLIE 
Thank you. 
(sitting down to the table; referring to the food) 
My, my! Scrambled eggs. 
PETER 
Egg. One eggdoughnutsblack coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints? 
ELLIE 
(cheerily) 
Nope. No complaints. 
PETER 
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint. 
ELLIE 
("sweetly") 
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this. 
PETER 
(gruffly) 
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning? 
ELLIE 
Must be the Spring. 
PETER 
I thought maybeuh"believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories. 
ELLIE 
PETER'S VOICE 
(from behind blanket) 
I hope Aunt Betty has a boy, don't you? She's always wanted a boy. I think we'll stop over in Wilkes-Barre this trip, darling. Give the family a treat. 
A close view shows Ellie and the detective. They have been staring at each other. 
ELLIE 
(very sweet, calling to Peter) 
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart. 
PETER'S VOICE 
Whome? 
(appearing from behind the blankets; pleasantly) 
Want to see me? 
DETECTIVE 
(who hasn't taken his eyes off Ellie) 
What's your name? 
ELLIE 
(innocently) 
Are you addressing me? 
DETECTIVE 
Yeah. What's your name? 
PETER 
(stepping in front of him) 
Hey, wait a minute! You're talking to my wife! You can't walk in here andwhat do you want, anyway? 
DETECTIVE 
We're looking for somebody. 
PETER 
Well, look your head offbut don't come bustin' in here. This isn't a public park. 
While Peter has been speaking, the second detective and Dyke have entered. They walk over to Peter, the First Detective, and Ellie. 
PETER 
I got a good mind to sock you right in the nose. 
FIRST DETECTIVE 
Take it easy, son. Take it easy. 
SECOND DETECTIVE 
(crowding forward) 
What's up? 
The Second Detective's eyes fall on Ellie and he stops to stare at her suspiciously. He takes a photograph out of his pocket which he inspects. 
DYKE 
(explains) 
These men are detectives, Mr. Warne. 
PETER 
(shouting) 
I wouldn't care if they were the whole police department. They can't come in here and start shooting questions at my wife! 
ELLIE 
(appearing very domestic) 
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question. 
PETER 
(turning on her; very sarcastic) 
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument? 
ELLIE 
(sharply; entering into the spirit of the pretense) 
Well, you don't have to lose your temper! 
PETER 
(mimicking her) 
You don't have to lose your temper! 
(in his own voice) 
That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance[7] when that big Swede made a pass at you 
ELLIE 
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times! 
The two detectives and Dyke are seen watching the other two, who are now out of sight. 
PETER'S VOICE 
(screaming) 
Oh, no! I saw him! He kept pawing you all over the dance floor! 
ELLIE'S VOICE 
He didn't! You were drunk! 
PETER 
(now seen with Ellie) 
Oh, so now I was drunk! 
ELLIE 
Well, you were! 
PETER 
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him. 
ELLIE 
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested! 
PETER 
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man! Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family! 
ELLIE 
(starting to cry) 
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute. 
Ellie goes over to her cot, and starts picking up her hat and things, whereupon Dyke, very much affected, turns to the detectives. 
DYKE 
Now look what you've done! 
FIRST DETECTIVE 
(apologetically) 
Sorry, Mr. Warne. But you see, we're supposed to check up on everybody. 
SECOND DETECTIVE 
We're looking for a girl by the name of Ellen Andrews. You knowthe daughter of the big Wall Street mug. 
A close-up of ELLIE appears as their voices are heard. 
FIRST DETECTIVE'S VOICE 
Your wife sure looks like her. Don't she, Mac? 
SECOND DETECTIVE'S VOICE 
She sure does. 
PETER 
(the entire group coming into view) 
Well, I hope you find her. 
(to Ellie) 
Quit bawling! Quit bawling! 
Some of the out of town papers may not have a picture of her. Herewire this to themI want it to break right away. 
As he hands the picture to Brown, the view moves in to a close-up of the PICTURE which dissolves to a close-up of the same picture in a newspaper, and as the view draws slowly back we see the headline over it, which reads 
"DAUGHTER OF BANKER DISAPPEARS 
TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD" 
The view then draws back to reveal SHAPELEY reading the newspaper. He stares long and absorbedly at the picture. Then slowly he turns his head toward the rear of the bus, and the view following his gaze passes a group of men singing "The Man On the Flying Trapeze." They are huddled together, and accompanied by a man who plays a guitar. Then the view continues moving until it reaches Peter and Ellie who join in the song, and a close-up of ELLIE shows her eyes sparkling as she sings gaily. 
SHAPELEY looks back at Ellie, and apparently comes to the conclusion that his suspicions are correct, for he quickly folds the newspaper, casting a surreptitious glance around to make certain he is not being watched. A diabolical smirk spreads over his face. 
A full view of the interior of the bus shows most of the occupants joining in the fun, singing. They seem unmindful of the discomfiture caused by the rocking of the bus, which throws them against each other. Then the view draws in to a front seat in which sit a woman and a small boy of ten. The woman's face is haggard and she sways 
uncertainly, her eyes half closed. Her small son's frightened face peers up at her. 
BOY 
(in a trembling voice) 
What'sa matter, Ma? Don't you feel all right? 
The woman struggles valiantly to recover her composure. She presses her son's small hand in a feeble effort at assurance. 
A close view of Ellie and Peter shows ELLIE singing more boisterously than the rest, doing the comical song with exaggerated gestures. But suddenly her face clouds, at something she sees. 
ELLIE 
(touching Peter's arm) 
Peter! 
(as he turns) 
There's something the matter with that woman. She looks ill. 
Peter follows her gaze, whereupon we see the WOMAN. Her head rolls weakly, a pained expression on her face. 
ELLIE 
(again seen with Peter; sympathetically) 
I better go over and see her. 
PETER 
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old womana trip like this. 
ELLIE 
(worried) 
Yes. 
We see the other passengers around Ellie and Peter enjoying themselves. One of them pokes her. 
MAN 
Hey, Galli-Curci,[9] come onget onto it! 
(poking Peter) 
You, too, McCormack. 
Ellie and Peter snap into it; they are just in time for the long wail which precedes the chorus: 
ELLIE AND PETER 
(singing) 
"O-o-o-ohHe flies through the air with the 
greatest of ease 
This daring young man on the flying trapeze" 
At this the scene cuts to the ROAD. The bus is caught in a muddy road, full of ruts, and at the moment wavers dangerously at an angle. The left front wheel is stuck in a deep hole, and the engine roars and clatters as the driver feeds the gas. Finally the bus moves forward, extricating the wheel; but just as it does, the right front wheel falls into another mud hole on the other side, and this time the bus seems hopelessly stuck, a close-up of the RIGHT WHEEL showing it revolving desperately, but in vain. The mud splashes in all directions, and the wheel seems to sink deeper and deeper. Thereupon this view cuts to the inside of the BUS. The bus 
is tilted over at an extreme angle, which has thrown Ellie into a corner on the floor, where she now crouches in an undignified position. She looks like a turtle, her head being invisible. 
ELLIE 
(sticking her head out) 
Thank the man for me, Peter. This is the first comfortable position I've had all night. 
Peter, amused, is assisting her to her feet. The guitarist has continued his playing uninterrupted, and as Peter lifts Ellie, he sings: 
PETER 
(singing) 
"She flies through the air with the greatest of ease. 
This darin' young maid on the flying trapeze 
(grunting) 
Her movements are gracefulall men does she please" 
A close view of the WOMAN and the LITTLE BOY now shows the latter terrifiedly watching his mother, whose head sags wearily. Finally she topples forward in a swoon. 
BOY 
(with a moan) 
Ma! Ma! What'sa matter with you? 
(tears stream down his cheeks) 
Somebody help me! Somethin's happened to her! 
The music stops abruptly. Everyone looks up, startled. Ellie starts forward, followed by Peter. Passengers closely group around the woman and chatter. "She's fainted. Look how pale she is." 
Peter and Ellie step up. 
PETER. 
Get some water, somebody. 
(to the boy) 
Let me get in here, son. 
Ellie goes out of sight to get water. The boy cries audibly, terror-stricken, but gets out of Peter's way, and Peter lifts the woman up and stretches her across the seat. Ellie comes back with water which she silently hands to Peter, who administers to the woman and when she slowly opens her eyes, makes her drink the water. The woman looks around, bewildered. 
PETER 
(consolingly) 
That's better. You're all right now. Just took a little nose-dive, that's all. 
He assists her in sitting up. The boy's wailing is heard, and he now rushes over and throws his arms around his mother. 
BOY 
(crying) 
Maoh, gee, Ma! 
His mother clings to him, but still feeling faint, her head sways. Peter looks up at Ellie and gives her a sign to sit down beside the woman. ELLIE sits down beside her. Peter takes the boy by the shoulders. 
PETER 
Come on, son. Better give your mother a chance to snap out of it. 
(as the boy emits a heart-breaking sob) 
It's all right, son. She'll be okay in a couple of minutes. 
He leads the boy away, while Ellie places her arm around the woman. 
ELLIE 
You'd better rest. It's been a hard trip, hasn't it? 
The scene cuts to a close view of SHAPELEY who has his eye peeled on Peter, watching him, and we next see Peter and the boy, who is still sobbing quietly. They are now standing away from the other passengers. 
BOY 
We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday. 
PETER 
What happened to your money? 
BOY 
Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much. 
(with a new outburst) 
We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkand if we didn't go, she might lose it. 
PETER 
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody? 
BOY 
I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess. 
Peter reaches into his pocket for a bill, just as Ellie approaches them. 
ELLIE 
She'll be all right, soon's she gets something to eat. 
Peter has extracted a single bill and dips in his pocket for a smaller one. Before he can find anything, however, Ellie takes the one he has in his hand and gives it to the boy. 
(suddenly) 
Do you pack a gat?[11] 
A close view of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly. 
SHAPELEY 
Huh? 
PETER 
A gat! A gat! 
(feeling him) 
Got any fireworks on you? 
SHAPELEY 
(weakly) 
Whyno 
PETER 
(carelessly) 
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them. 
(Shapeley is beginning to realize he is in for something he hadn't bargained for, and stares speechlessly at Peter, who continues blandly) 
Expect a little trouble up North. May have to shoot it out with cops. 
The perspiration starts appearing on Shapeley's brow (as we see him in a close-up). Peter's voice continues: 
PETER'S VOICE 
(with emphasis) 
If you come through all right, your five G's are in the bag. Maybe more. I'll talk to the "Killer"see that he takes care of you. 
SHAPELEY 
(finally finding his voice) 
The Killer? 
PETER 
(seen with Shapeley; watching the latter to gauge the effect of his words) 
Yeahthe "big boy"the Boss of the outfit. 
SHAPELEY 
(shakily) 
You're not kidnapping her, are you? 
PETER 
(tough) 
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you? 
(contemptuously) 
Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers. 
SHAPELEY 
(stammering) 
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, seeand 
PETER 
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow? 
SHAPELEY 
(raising his voice, pleadingly) 
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with 
PETER 
(gripping his arm) 
Sh-sh-sh! Soft pedal, you mug!before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it! 
(low and menacingly) 
Now listen, you're in this thingand you're staying in! Get me? You know too much. 
SHAPELEY 
(frightened out of his wits) 
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't. 
PETER 
Yeah ?How do I know? 
(he reaches into his coat threateningly) 
I gotta good mind to plug you. 
(arguing with himself) 
I shouldn't take any chances on you. 
SHAPELEY 
(breaking down) 
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut. 
PETER. 
Yeah? 
(he glares at Shapeley a moment silently, as if making up his mind) 
What's your name? 
SHAPELEY 
Oscar Shapeley. 
PETER 
Where do you live? 
SHAPELEY 
Orange, New Jersey. 
PETER 
Got a couple of kids, huh? 
SHAPELEY 
Yeah. Just babies. 
PETER 
You love them, don't you? 
SHAPELEY 
(sensing the threat; horrified) 
Oh, gee, Misteryou wouldn'tyou ain't thinkin' about 
PETER 
(threateningly) 
You'll keep your trap shut, all right. 
SHAPELEY 
(quickly) 
SuresureI'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister. 
PETER 
If you don'tEver hear of Bugs Dooley? 
SHAPELEY 
No. 
PETER 
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the 
river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out. 
(Shapeley can't stand much more of this. He is ready to keel over) 
SHAPELEY 
Gee! That musta been terrible. 
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding. 
ELLIE 
(another silence before she speaks again) 
My uncleMother's brotherhad four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back." 
PETER 
I don't think there's a "piggy-back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider. 
ELLIE 
That's silly. 
PETER 
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxationa warm heartand a loving nature. 
ELLIE 
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose. 
PETER 
Not a one. 
ELLIE 
You're prejudiced. 
PETER 
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instancea natural "piggy-backer." 
(contemptuously) 
Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family? 
(turning) 
Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he 
In his excitement he wheels around to speak to her, forgetting that as he turns she goes with him. Not finding her at his right, he swings around to his left. Naturally he takes Ellie with himand realizing his mistake he mutters: 
PETER 
Aw, nuts! 
He proceeds on his way, walking faster than before. They continue this way silently for some time. Finally Ellie breaks the silence. 
ELLIE 
(persistently) 
My father was a great "piggy-backer." 
Peter raises his eyes heavenward in thorough disgust, then calmly hands his suitcase to her. 
PETER 
Hold this a minute. 
Ellie takes the suitcase from him, and his hand now free, he delivers a resounding smack on her backside, so that Ellie lets out a yelp. 
PETER 
(taking the suitcase) 
Thank you. 
The scene dissolves to the edge of a cow PASTURE, at night, and Ellie and Peter are revealed climbing under a barbed wire fence, following which the scene dissolves to a HAYSTACK, in front. Peter sets his bag down and surveys the layout, Ellie watching him. 
PETER 
(to himself) 
This looks like the best spot. 
ELLIE 
We're not going to sleep out here, are we? 
PETER 
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it. 
And he busies himself laying out a bed for her, pulling hay from the stack and spreading it out on the ground. Ellie wanders aim-lessly and then moves to a rock, where she sits and watches Peter. 
ELLIE 
(after a pause; coyly) 
Peter 
PETER 
(as a close view shows him still arranging her bed; grumbling) 
What? 
ELLIE'S VOICE 
I'm hungry. 
PETER 
(without looking up) 
Just your imagination. 
ELLIE 
(seen at the rock, while Peter is out of sight) 
No, it isn't. I'm hungry andand scared. 
PETER'S VOICE 
You can't be hungry and scared at the same time. 
ELLIE 
(insisting) 
Well, I am. 
PETER 
(as both he and Ellie are seen in their respective places) 
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you. 
ELLIE 
(argumentatively) 
Not if you're more hungry than scared. 
PETER 
(impatiently) 
All right. You win. Let's forget it. 
ELLIE 
(after a pause) 
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry. 
PETER 
(tearing his hair; screaming) 
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you! 
This brings silence, and he goes on building a bed for her. Then a close-up of Ellie shows her watching him. Her eyes soften. A very definite interest in him is slowly but surely blossoming, and the fact that he is making her bed adds to the intimacy of the scene. A close view of PETER shows him concentrating on his task, but he pauses a moment and turns to glance at her. It is a devouring look, which he quickly dispels by working more feverishly on her bed. 
PETER 
(muttering while he works) 
If I had any sense, I'd have been in New York by this time. 
(he emphasizes his feelings by yanking viciously at the hay as both of them are now seen) 
Taking a married woman back to her husband. Hunh! What a prize sucker I turned out to be. 
(He has her bed ready; without glancing at her) 
Come onyour bed's all ready. 
She, watches him a moment, then rising slowly, starts toward Peter. Then she stands over her bed, surveying it speculatively. 
ELLIE 
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled. 
PETER 
(sharply) 
Well, take them off. 
ELLIE 
(shocked) 
(after a pause) 
Nothing you'd give two cents for. 
ELLIE 
(seen close) 
Try me. 
PETER'S VOICE 
I just want to be let alone, that's all. Life's swell if you don't try too hard. Most people want to get a strangle-hold on it. They're not living. They're just feverish. 
(now appearing with her) 
If they didn't get themselves all balled up with a lot of manufactured values, they'd find what they want. Peace and calm. When you get right down to it, what's all the shootin' for, will you tell me? After all, you can only eat three meals a day, only sleep in one bed 
(looking up) 
Right now, that hay feels pretty good to you, doesn't it? Sure it does. 'Cause you were tiredand it's the only thing around. 
ELLIE 
You sound like a hobo. 
PETER 
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter? 
ELLIE 
Doesn't sound very exciting. 
PETER, seen close, looks at her for a long time before speaking: 
PETER 
I guess not. I'd have given odds it wouldn't mean anything to you. 
(he goes over and flops down on his own side of hay) 
There were moments when I had hopes. When Iaw, I'm wasting timeYou're destined to be a dope the rest of your life. 
(contemptuously) 
I pity you. Goodnight. 
He turns over with a finality that precludes any further discussion, following which a close-up of ELLIE reveals that her eyes are wide open, staring thoughtfully up at the sky. The scene fades out slowly. 
Part Seven 
A ROAD fades in. It is day now, and Peter and Ellie are trundling along. Ellie limps, and wears an unhappy expression on her face. 
ELLIE 
What are you thinking about? 
PETER 
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you. 
ELLIE 
(pleased) 
Really? 
PETER 
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy. 
ELLIE 
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing? 
PETER 
Hitch-hiking. 
ELLIE 
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking 
(strongly) 
where does the hitching come in? 
PETER 
(amused at her) 
A little early yet. No cars out yet. 
She spies a rock and heads for it. Then we see her seated on the rock. 
ELLIE 
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come. 
(Peter comes over, sets his bag down, and prepares to wait) 
Got a toothpick? 
PETER 
No. But I've got a penknife. 
(he extracts one from his pocket which he snaps open) 
ELLIE 
Hayin my teeth. 
She points to her front teeth, and Peter flicks the hay out of her teeth. 
PETER 
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast. 
ELLIE 
Needn't rub it in. 
(Peter takes a carrot out of his coat pocket and starts nibbling on it; Ellie looks up at this) 
What're you eating? 
PETER 
Carrots. 
ELLIE 
Raw? 
PETER 
Uh-huh. Want one? 
ELLIE 
(emphatically) 
No!! 
(as Peter smacks his lips with satisfaction) 
It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat. 
PETER 
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you. 
(he takes a bite) 
Best thing in the world for youcarrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught megoodnight! 
ELLIE 
I hate the horrid stuff. 
While she speaks a car roars by at terrific speed. Peter and Ellie both jump up. 
PETER 
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away. 
(Ellie goes back to her rock, despondently) 
ELLIE 
What if nobody stops for us? 
PETER 
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them. 
ELLIE 
You're an expert, I suppose. 
PETER 
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail." 
ELLIE 
There's no end to your accomplishments. 
As life's corners I . . . 
PETER 
(giving up) 
All right, let it go. 
DANKER 
(completing his last line) 
. . . turn." 
The scene dissolves to the front of a LUNCH WAGON on a deserted road, and Danker's car drives into the scene and stops. Then we see Danker turning to Ellie and Peter. 
DANKER 
How about a bite to eat? 
ELLIE 
(quickly) 
Why, I think that would be 
PETER 
(stopping her) 
No, thanks. We're not hungry. 
DANKER 
(sentimentally) 
Oh, I see, young people in love are never hungry. 
PETER 
No. 
DANKER 
(singing as he leaves them) 
"Young people in love 
Are very seldom hungry. 
People in love 
Are very seldom hungry . . ." 
When he is out of sight, Peter glares at Ellie. 
PETER 
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?[13] 
ELLIE 
(defiantly) 
Why not? I'm hungry. 
PETER 
Eat a carrot. 
ELLIE 
Never! 
(she starts out of car) 
I'm going in and ask him 
PETER 
(grabbing her arm) 
If you do, I'll break your neck. 
She looks up at his glowering face, realizes he means it, and wilts under his dominant gaze. 
PETER 
Let's get out and stretch our legs. 
Peter gets out, followed by Ellie, and they walk away from the car. Both are silent. At the DOOR of the LUNCH WAGON, then, Danker comes out and looks around furtively. Ellie and Peter, as seen by him, appear, walking away, following which the view moves over to the Ford and drops down to a close-up of Peter's suitcase. Now Danker looks about quickly and starts toward his car. He springs into the car, steps on the starter, and is off. 
ELLIE and PETER hear the motor. They wheel around, and their eyes widen in surprise. 
PETER 
Hey! 
He flings his coat at Ellie and dashes after the Ford. He is then seen running after it when the car turns around a bend in the road. Peter continues the pursuit. This scene wiping off, the FORD now makes its appearance around the bend, and as it approaches, Peter is seen at the wheel. He looks like he's just been through a fight. And as Peter rides in, Ellie comes running toward him. 
ELLIE 
(a note of great relief in her voice) 
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right? 
PETER 
Come onget in. 
ELLIE 
(noticing a gash in his cheek) 
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on 
PETER 
(impatiently) 
Come on! come on! 
(at this she runs around to get in the other side) 
ELLIE 
(as she runs) 
What happened? 
PETER 
(as we see them closer) 
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket! 
(by this time she is in the car) 
ELLIE 
What'd you give him for the car? 
PETER 
A black eye. 
(thereupon the car moves out of sight) 
A close view shows Peter and Ellie driving along in the Ford. Peter looks ahead, uncommunicatively. Ellie glances up at him, and it is plain that something's on her mind. 
ELLIE 
(a little self-consciously) 
Lookuhhow are theuhcarrots holding out? Any left? 
Peter glances at her. He knows what a concession this is on her part, and he smiles sympathetically. 
PETER 
(tenderly) 
You don't have to eat the carrots. 
(as she looks her surprise) 
Just passed a pond with some ducks in it. 
ELLIE 
(with a cry of joy) 
Darling! 
She reaches up and kisses his cheek, and Peter beams happily. 
PETER 
(looking worried) 
Haven't much gas left in this thing. Got to start promoting some. 
(throwing her his coat) 
Better take the things out of the pocket of that coat. Ought to be good for ten gallons. 
The scene fades out. 
Part Eight 
(softening) 
What's the thousand bucks for? 
PETER 
To tear down the Walls of Jericho. 
GORDON 
What! 
PETER 
Never mind . . . Listensuppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled. 
GORDON 
Huh? 
PETER 
That she's going to marry somebody else. 
GORDON 
You're drunk. 
PETER 
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you? 
GORDON 
If it's on the level. 
PETER 
Well, I got it, Joe. 
GORDON 
Who's she gonna marry? 
PETER 
(taking out the story from his pocket) 
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours. 
GORDON 
(skeptically) 
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk. 
PETER 
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail! 
GORDON 
I'd put you there myself. 
PETER 
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either. 
GORDON 
Who's the guy she's gonna marry? 
PETER 
I am, Joe. 
GORDON 
(his eyes widening) 
You! 
PETER 
Yeah. 
GORDON 
Now I know you're drunk. 
(he grabs his hat) 
I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more. 
PETER 
(running after Gordon as the latter starts out) 
For heaven's sake, Joestop being an editor for just a minute. 
(he grabs his arm) 
We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level. 
Gordon is affected by the sincere note in Peter's voice. 
PETER 
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute. 
(hoarsely) 
I'm in love with her, Joe. 
GORDON 
Well, I'll be 
PETER 
Listen, Palyou've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone. 
(self-consciously) 
A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he? 
While Peter has been speaking Gordon stares into space thoughtfully. 
GORDON 
What a story! 
(picturing it) 
On her way to join her husband, Ellen Andrews falls in love with 
(alertgrabbing paper out of Peter's hand) 
Lemme see that a minute. 
He moves to his desk excitedly, and Peter, a gleam of hope in his eyes, joins him, following which the scene cuts to the SHACK of the camp owner and wife in the early morning. The owner is suddenly startled out of his sleep by the voice of his wife calling, "zeke! zeke!" He looks up, just as she rushes into the room. 
WIFE 
I told you! I told you, you couldn't trust him! He's gone! 
OWNER 
Who? 
WIFE 
That feller last night, that's who! He was gonna stay a week, huh? Well, he's skipped. Took the car with him, too. We wouldn't have known a thing about it until morning if I hadn't took that magnesia. 
(pulling at him) 
Come on, get up, don't lay there. Let's do something about it. 
Thereupon the scene cuts to the AUTO CAMP CABIN affording a close view of ELLIE tossing restlessly in her sleep. Suddenly there is a loud banging on the door, and Ellie, startled, awakens. The pounding continuing, Ellie looks around, frightened. The door suddenly bursts open, and the owner and wife enter. They both glance over at Peter's side. 
WIFE 
See that. They're gone! 
OWNER 
(timidly) 
Looks like it, don't it? 
(suddenly he sees Ellie) 
Here's the woman, ma. 
WIFE 
(full of fightglaring at Ellie) 
Oh!! 
ELLIE 
(in a close view at Ellie's Bed as the owner and his wife come up to her; timidlysitting up) 
What's the matter? 
WIFE 
Where's your husband, young lady 
With King Westley in it. He's waiting at the church. Big tears streaming down his face. His bride hasn't shown up. Old Man Andrews is there, 
too. Laughing his head off. Everything exaggerated. You knowNow snap into it! 
(he bangs up the receiver, and grabs the second phone, speaking into it impatiently) 
Yeah. Yeah. What is it? 
A close view of GORDON, as he listens, shows his eyes widening with amazement. 
GORDON 
What!Ellen Andrews! You're crazy! 
This cuts to a TELEPHONE BOOTH where a reporter is seen speaking excitedly. 
REPORTER 
Yeah. She just phoned her father from an auto camp to come and get her. He's getting a police escort. Westley's going along, too. She's been traveling by bus. The moment she read that her father and Westley made up, she phoned in. 
Back in GORDON'S OFFICE Gordon is seen still at the phone. 
GORDON 
You sure that's right! Say, you haven't been drinking, have you! Okaygrab a carand stay with them. 
(he hangs up the receiver and grabs the first phone) 
Put Hank on. 
(shouting) 
Agnes! 
(as the secretary hurries in) 
Get me a doctor. I'm about to have a nervous breakdown. 
(she stares at him dumbly as he speaks into the phone) 
Hankforget everything I just told you. I was just having a nightmare! 
(he hangs upand turns to Agnes) 
Call up the police department! Tell 'em to find Peter Warne. Send out a general alarm. I want the dirty crook pinched. 
He picks up Peter's story and flings it viciously into the wastebasket. 
AGNES 
(starting out) 
Yessir. 
(two re-write men come in, passing Agnes) 
MEN 
You want us? 
GORDON 
(wheeling around) 
Yeah. Shove everything off the front page. Ellen Andrews just phoned her fathershe's coming home. The moment she heard the old man withdrew his objections, she gave herself up. Spread it all over the place. Here's your lead: "Love Triumphant!" Step on it! 
MEN 
(leaving) 
Yessir. 
Gordon goes to his desk, mumbling to himself. His eye lights on the waste basket containing Peter's story, and he is about to kick it when he stops. He stares at it thoughtfully, reaches down, lifts it outruns through it hastilyand then stares into space, deep in thought. 
The scene dissolves to an open ROAD, in the morning, as Peter flies over it in his Ford. He beams happily. He passes a gasoline truck and waves cheerily to the driver. This dissolves to a close-up of an AUTO SIREN accompanied by a prolonged wail, then to a ROAD, that morning, as four motorcycles, two abreast, speed forward, followed by a luxurious limousine, which in turn is trailed by a car filled with reporters. Next, in the LIMOUSINE, Andrews is seen in the back seat. He is accompanied by King WestleyHendersonLovington, and a police inspector. 
HENDERSON 
I knew she was safe. 
LOVINGTON 
(sighing) 
Certainly gave us a run for our money. 
(but Andrews is too overwhelmed with joy to listen to any of this) 
ANDREWS 
(anxiously) 
Can't you get them to go any faster? 
(at this the Inspector leans over to talk to chauffeur) 
This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing. 
PETER 
(singing) 
"I found a million dollar baby" 
He is interrupted by the song of a meadowlark, whistling its strange melody. Peter listens to it a second time, then answers its call by imitating it. The meadowlark whistles again, and peter is highly amused. 
PETER 
(waving his handto the meadowlark) 
Okay, pal. Be seein' you. 
Just then the sound of sirens is heard in the distance. Peter glances back, and as the sirens come nearer, he pulls over to the side of the road. There follows a full view of the ROAD, with peter in the foreground at the side as the police cavalcade whizzes by accompanied by the shrieking sirens. Thereupon PETER (seen close) gets an idea. 
PETER 
(to his Ford) 
Come on, Dobbin, old boy. We got a police escort. 
He applies the gas and shoots out of sight, following which a full view of the road shows Peter's car trying to catch up with the parade. It outdistances him, however, and we see PETER in the Ford pressing his body forward to help the car make time. His foot pushes the accelerator down to the floor. But the police cars are now out of sight, and Peter gives up. 
PETER 
(seen close; to the carwith exaggerated dramatics) 
Dobbin, me lad. You failed muh. I'm afraid you're gittin' old. 
Thereupon the scene dissolves to a small town ROAD, where at the door of a Sheriff's office a policeman is standing on guard. The reporters hang around in front of him. Several yokels look on. The limousine and motor cycles are at the curb. And now, in a closer view, at the DOOR the policeman on guard steps aside as the door opens and Ellie, her father, and King Westley emerge. King has his arm around her. The moment they appear in the doorway, cameras click and several reporters surround them. 
REPORTERS 
Will you make a statement Miss Andrews? Was it an exciting experience? How did you travel? 
ANDREWS 
(brushing them aside) 
Later, boys, later. See her at home. 
They cross the sidewalkto the waiting limousine, as cameras click. 
The scene dissolves to a ROAD, with Peter still driving. He is, however, as before, in excellent form, and is singing lustily. Suddenly, however, his eyes widen and he pulls on his brake; the car screeches and moansand comes to a stop. 
PETER 
Take it easy, Dobbin. Remember your blood pressure. 
We find Peter directly in front of a slow moving freight train. Several hoboes stick their heads out of a car, and Peter waves to them. The hoboes look puzzled for a minute and then wave back. The view then swings over to an opening between the cars affording a flash of the police parade on the other side, apparently on its way back. 
PETER amuses himself by talking to an old flagman. 
PETER 
Better get that toy train out of here. I'm in a hurry. 
The Flagman grins at him in reply. By this time the last car is in sight, and Peter gets all set to move. He stops, however, to wave to a couple of brakemen on the rear platform. 
In the meantime, the motorcycles have started forward, and the sirens begin their low, moaning wail. Peter, attracted, turns, and over Peter's shoulder we see the parade starting. As the limousine 
passes, we get a glimpse of the inside. Ellie lies back on King Westley's shoulder. He has his arm around her as they pass out of sight. Thereupon a close view of PETER shows him reacting to what he saw. He turns his head quickly to stare at the disappearing car, a look of astonishment and bewilderment in his eyes. Slowly he turns his head forward, staring ahead of him blankly; he can't quite make it out. Then gradually the significance of it all strikes himand his mouth curls up bitterly. 
The scene wiping off, a series of NEWSPAPER HEADLINES come into view: 
"ELLEN ANDREWS RETURNS HOME." 
"MARRIAGE HALTED BY FATHER TO BE RESUMED" 
"ELLEN ANDREWS AND AVIATOR TO HAVE CHURCH WEDDING" 
"LOVE TRIUMPHS AGAIN" 
"PARENTAL OBJECTION REMOVED IN FAVOR OF LOVERS" 
"CANNOT THWART LOVE SAYS FATHER OF ELLEN ANDREWS" 
"GLAD TO BE HOME SAYS ELLEN" 
This dissolves to the anteroom of a NEWSPAPER OFFICE. The place is alive with activity, and copies of newspapers are lying around, bearing headlines relating to the Andrews story. Peter, a bewildered, stunned expression on his face, enters and crosses funereally toward Gordon's office. Several people standing around look up. 
PEOPLE 
Hi, PeteDidya see this? Ellen Andrews is back. Gonna marry that Westley guy after allWhat a dame! What a dame! 
Peter pays no attention to any of this. He reaches Gordon's door, which is open. He walks directly past Agnes and enters the office. She looks up at him, puzzled. Then in GORDON'S OFFICE, Peter walks to Gordon's desk and lays the roll of bills on it. Agnes enters, watching him anxiously. 
AGNES 
Gordon's out back some place. 
KING 
(taking his handrising) 
Yes, sir. 
ANDREWS 
(dismissing him) 
Fine. I'll see you at the reception. 
He withdraws his hand, which he looks at disgustedlythe result of a jellyfish handshake. 
KING 
Oh, by the way, Mr Andrews, I thought of a great stunt for the reception. 
(as Andrews looks at him quizzically) 
I'm going to land on the lawn in an autogyro.[14] What do you think of that! 
A close view of ANDREWS shows him staring off at King in complete disgust. 
ANDREWS 
You thought that up all by yourself, huh? 
KING 
(unabashed) 
Why, it'll make all the front pages. A spectacular thing like that 
ANDREWS 
(hard) 
Personally, I think it's stupid! 
(humoring a child) 
But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object. 
KING 
Oh, no. She'll be crazy about it. Well, see you later. I'm going out on the lawn and arrange for landing space. 
(holding out his hand) 
Goodbye. 
(but Andrews turns his back on him) 
ANDREWS 
We've done that already. 
KING 
(smiling) 
Yes, of course. 
He turns and leaves; Andrews watching him go, shaking his head sadly. 
ANDREWS 
Autogyro! I hope he breaks his leg. 
Andrews starts out, and the scene cuts to the HALLWAY as Andrews enters from the study. A maid coming down the stairs, he calls to her: 
ANDREWS 
OhMary 
MARY 
Yes, sir? 
ANDREWS 
How is she? 
MARY 
(hesitantly) 
Whyuhshe's all right, sir. 
ANDREWS 
What's the matter? Anything wrong? 
MARY 
Oh, no, sir. No different than 
ANDREWS 
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh? 
MARY 
Yessir. If you'll excuse me, sirshe sent me for a drink. 
(she leaves) 
Andrews stands a moment thoughtfully and then starts up the stairs, following which the scene dissolves to the UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR in front of Ellie's door. Andrews enters and knocks several times. Receiving no response, he gingerly opens the door. 
Next Andrews enters ELLIE'S BEDROOM and looks around. The view swings around the room, following his gaze. It focuses on Ellie, who reclines on a sofa, in her bridal outfit, her head resting on the back. She stares moodily, unhappily up at the ceiling. The view then expanding to include both father and daughter, Andrews is seen staring at her a moment sympathetically. He senses something is wrong. 
ANDREWS 
(after a pause) 
Ellie 
ELLIE 
(jumping up with a start) 
Oh, hello, Dad. 
ANDREWS 
(a close view as he goes over to her) 
I knocked several times. 
ELLIE 
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming. 
(to hide her confusion, she reaches for a cigarette) 
ANDREWS 
(with forced lightness) 
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull. 
ELLIE 
(in a faraway voice) 
Stunt? 
ANDREWS 
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro. 
ELLIE 
Oh, yes. I heard. 
ANDREWS 
(noting her listlessness) 
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too. 
As he continues talking, the view moves with Ellie, who wanders over to a window overlooking the lawn and stares out, lost in thought. 
ANDREWS' VOICE 
(he goes over the Ellie) 
You look lovely. Are you pleased with the gown? 
(as Ellie does not seem to hear him, he becomes worried) 
Ellie! 
ELLIE 
(turning and looking at him blankly) 
Huh? 
(it just penetrates) 
Ohthe gown 
(distantly) 
Yes, it's beautiful. 
ANDREWS 
(she shrugs futilely) 
ANDREWS 
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off? 
ELLIE 
No, I'll go through with it. 
ANDREWS 
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why 
ELLIE 
It doesn't matter. 
(tired) 
I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to youmade your life so miserableand mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember. 
A close-up of ANDREWS shows him watching Ellie, as her voice continues. 
ELLIE'S VOICE 
I've got to settle down. It really doesn't matter howor whereor with whom. 
ANDREWS 
(seriouslyimpressed) 
You've changed, Ellie. 
ELLIE 
(seen with Andrews; sighing) 
Yes, I guess I have. 
(sincerely) 
I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous. 
(she shrugs resignedly) 
Besides, what difference does it make? 
(inaudibly) 
I'll never see Peter again. 
ANDREWS 
Is that his name? 
ELLIE 
Yes. Peter Warne. 
She starts to walk away when she is attracted by her father's surprise at the mention of the name. 
ANDREWS 
Peter Warne! 
(his hand has instinctively gone to his inside pocket) 
ELLIE 
(noticing this) 
Why? Do you know him? 
(but Andrews withdraws his hand. Apparently he has changed his mind) 
ANDREWS 
(evasively) 
Oh, nono. 
ELLIE 
(suddenly anxious) 
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad? 
ANDREWS 
(obviously guilty) 
Why, no . . . Don't be silly. 
ELLIE 
Oh, please, Dad 
She has reached into his pocket and has extracted a letter, which she hurriedly opens and reads, following which we see a LETTER in Peter's handwriting. It is addressed to: "Alexander Andrews, 11 Wall Street." It reads: 
"Dear Sir: 
I should like to have a talk with you about a financial matter in connection with your daughter. 
Peter Warne." 
Ellie is then seen reading and re-reading the note. Her face clouds and then slowly changes to an expression of complete disillusionment. 
ELLIE 
(her voice strident) 
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward. 
ANDREWS 
(taking the note from her) 
I'm sorry you read it. 
ELLIE 
Are you going to see him? 
ANDREWS 
I suppose so. 
ELLIE 
(hard) 
Certainly! Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets. 
She paces agitatedly, Andrews watching her silently. He knows what an awful blow to her pride this must be. Mary now enters with a cocktail tray which she sets on the table. 
ELLIE 
Thanks, Mary. That's just what I need. 
(she pours herself a cocktail) 
MARY 
Mr. King Westley is on his way up. 
ELLIE 
FineFine! Have him come in. 
ANDREWS 
(mumbling) 
I'll be going. 
(he goes out behind Mary) 
Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters. 
ELLIE 
(upon seeing him) 
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King. 
A close view of the Two shows King taking her in his arms. 
KING 
How are you, Ellie? 
(he gives her a kiss, which she accepts perfunctorilybut he insists upon being ardent) 
Are you happy? 
ELLIE 
(releasing herself) 
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity. 
(handing him a drink) 
Here you are, King. Let's drink. 
(she holds her glass out) 
Let's drink to us .

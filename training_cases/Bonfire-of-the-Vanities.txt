Cars and people caught in the same frantic ballet of shining lights as we RACE UP the avenue, and the voice of Peter Fallow speaks to us... PETER (V.O.) Yes. We're getting closer. Can you feel it. Can you see it? The heat. The brilliance. Moving fast into the heart of it. Buzz. Buzz. Can you feel the buzz? The city is pulling you in. The city of light. The city of diabolical promise. The city of answered prayers. 4      OMITTED                                                    4 thru                                                              thru A11A   EXT.

pulls up. A male and female aide -- both carrying walkie-talkies -- rush to open the door. They pry PETER FALLOW from the back seat. He is wearing a tuxedo and dark glasses. He is very drunk, disheveled and cheerful beyond his means. CONTINUE IN ONE SHOT as... TWO AIDES 
try to lead Fallow into the building. Fallow is clutch- ing a whiskey decanter and a seltzer bottle. He leans heavily on the aides, stumbles and can barely stay on his feet.

approaches. The aides flag it down and throw Fallow onto the cart. The cart carries him past the garbage con- tainer into a long tunnel-like corridor. 
FALLOW 
sways on the cart, trying to mix a drink for himself -- he pulls a glass out of one pocket and some ice cubes out of another pocket. But he is physically incompetent. 
FEMALE AIDE jumps onto the cart and tries to hold him up.   The male aide runs alongside the cart. 
VARIOUS WAITERS in black tie carry covered silver trays as they trot through the tunnel. VARIOUS BUSBOYS 
come running in the other way, pushing carts filled with dirty dishes and glasses. CART 
comes to the end of the tunnel and jerks to a halt. Fallow loses his balance and sprays the female aide with soda water. MALE AIDE pulls Fallow off the cart and continues to lead him through a dark, red-lit area. Several security guards run to meet them. The guards and the aide now escort Fallow through the area. A FEW PHOTOGRAPHERS 
pop out of nowhere, trying to get a picture. The guards push them away and lead Fallow into a lighted corridor. 
FOREIGN DIPLOMAT 
and his wife and daughter join the entourage as they head for an elevator. The diplomat offers Fallow a pen and a book to autograph. 
FOURTH MAN Bid eight and a half. And then I want you to work hard on this, see what's happening with the escrow, do they forfeit or no? FIFTH    MAN This Goldman order    really fucked things up. And the     banks are calling it 73. Why     are they pissing on us like    that? (CONTINUED)

Please call me at the office. I have to speak to you. RAWLIE THORPE comes running up to Sherman. RAWLIE Gene's on from London.    Let's go! Let's go! SHERMAN Calm down, Rawlie. Let's not get over-excited. RAWLIE Yes, Sherman.    Sorry. 
SHERMAN Calm. Cool. Colated. Let's not lose our composure over a few hundred million dollars.

Sherman and several men are seated at attention facing an Adam bowfront cabinet. The cabinet is richly painted with scenes of bucolic splendor and ornate borders. On top of this museum piece, a black plastic SPEAKER over which the voice of Gene Lopwitz is addressing his inferiors. GENE (V.O.) But what the hell is this crazy Giscard deal going to cost us, Sherman? SHERMAN I need six hundred million to buy up the bonds... GENE (V.O.) (on speaker) Jesus. You want us to sit on six hundred million dollars worth of French government bonds?! 
SHERMAN I'm confident on this, Gene.   It's a real sleeping beauty. A THROTTLED ROAR comes out of the SPEAKER. RAWLIE Where are you, Gene? 
GENE (V.O.) Tottenham Park. At a cricket match. Somebody's just hit the hell out of the ball. The ball's kind of dead, though. RAWLIE Who's playing? 
GENE (V.O.) Don't get technical on me, Rawlie. Bunch of nice young men in white flannel pants. 
SHERMAN What do you say, Gene.   Are we in or out? (CONTINUED)

SHERMAN Bernard Sachs is already in for                        * three hundred million. Does that make you feel better? GENE (V.O.) (on speaker) Sherman, you're going to make me an old man. 
SHERMAN A rich old man, Gene.   A rich old man. Another ROAR of the CROWD comes over the SPEAKERS. GENE (V.O.) (on speaker) What was that? Oh. It's over. Is it over? The game's over. Well. That's that, I guess. SHERMAN I guess you had to be there. Eh, Gene? (CONTINUED)

SHERMAN At ease, gentlemen. The meeting breaks up. 
36    ANGLE - SHERMAN                                             36 moving through the bond trading room to his desk.                 * 
PETER (V.O.) The roar enveloped him. Music to his ears. The sound of educated young white men baying for money on the bond market. Six hundred million in his hands. Six million off the top for Pierce & Pierce. One point seven million for Sherman. All in a day's work. He was there. At the top -- impervious, untouchable, insulated by wealth and power. A great height from which to view the rest of the poor world. A great height from which to fall. 36A   ANGLE - FAX MACHINE                                         36A   * SPITTING OUT the message: "Sherman, Arriving New York             * on the Concorde tonight.

The sky is a labyrinth of planes taking off and landing. 38    INT. INTERNATIONAL ARRIVALS - MARIA - NIGHT                 38 
comes out of the customs area into the lobby. She is a vision -- young, beautiful, ultra-chic in her big- shouldered electric blue Norma Kamali type jacket, her miniskirt, her lizard shoes. The sweaty hordes of panting tourists all seem to part like the Red Sea as Maria passes through them, followed by a porter and a trolley full of luggage. 
39    ANGLE - SHERMAN                                             39

Maria leans toward Sherman and presses her foot down on the accelerator. The car jerks into motion. 
SHERMAN Maria! MARIA Drive, Sherman. Just drive. 
57   EXT. MERCEDES - NIGHT                                          57 leaps across the intersection and continues down the boulevard.

SHERMAN I just don't want to do anything stupid. If we keep our heads, we'll be perfectly fine. MARIA Christ. We're in the middle of a goddamn war zone and you're worried about doing the right thing. Look! There! 
59   EXT. STREET - SIGN                                             59 reads "895 EAST GEO. WASH. BRIDGE." And just beyond the sign, a ramp leading up to the expressway. 
MARIA (O.S.) There! George Washington Bridge, you see it?! 
60   INT. MERCEDES - ANGLE THROUGH WINDSHIELD - SHERMAN AND         60 MARIA - NIGHT As Sherman pulls toward the ramp. Another pothole jolts the car. Maria's luggage flies forward, hitting Sherman in the back of his neck. At the same time, Maria sees something in the road ahead of them. (CONTINUED)

Sherman hits the brake.      The CAR stalls and comes to a SCREECHING halt. 
MARIA It's a body. SHERMAN It looks like... 
MARIA It's an animal. 
SHERMAN I think it's a... MARIA Is it dead? SHERMAN It's a wheel, that's all.   It's a tire. MARIA It's a dead tire! SHERMAN Calm down, Maria. Please. It's a tire and some ash cans or something. Sherman starts to get out of the car. MARIA What are you doing?! 
SHERMAN Well, I can't drive around it, can I? 
MARIA You're going to move it? SHERMAN Yes. That's exactly what I'm going to do. MARIA For God's sake, be careful of your shoes.

But he can't see them. He can only hear them and feel their vibration. He stands there a moment, taking in the strangeness of the place and of his own situation -- the tire, Maria, his wife, his life. A little chill of lone- liness hits him. He shakes it off and walks to the tire -- a simple, inevitable move toward a destiny he could never have imagined. 62   ANGLE - TIRE                                                     62

MARIA (O.S.) Sherman! He turns, tire in his hands and sees... 63   HIS POV - TWO FIGURES                                            63 walking toward him. One big, young, powerfully built (ROLAND AUBURN). He looks dangerous. The other slight, hesitant, a few steps behind the first one (HENRY LAMB). They are both black. ROLAND Yo!   Need some help? 64   QUICK CUTS - SCENE                                               64 Sherman is standing there holding the tire.      The two young men are moving steadily toward him. ROLAND What happened, man? You need some help? SHERMAN No thanks. Hi. No, I don't think so. No. Thank you very much. Sherman is confused. He doesn't move. Maria gets behind the wheel of the car. Roland reaches slowly into his jacket pocket. He smiles and keeps moving toward Sherman. Sherman sees the hand moving out of the jacket pocket. He is still frozen. Maria BLOWS the HORN. Sherman wakes up finally. 
SHERMAN Excuse me.   I have to go. (CONTINUED) 
64   CONTINUED:                                                   64 He starts to move toward the car, still carrying the tire. Roland steps in front of him. They both keep moving. 
ROLAND Where you going with that tire? 
SHERMAN Oh. Is this yours? Here.    You take it. Sherman pushes the tire toward Roland. Roland pushes it back at him. Sherman throws up his arms. The tire bounces off his arms and knocks Roland down. SHERMAN Oh. Sorry.   I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... 65   ANGLE - MARIA                                                65 HONKS the HORN again and drives the car toward Sherman. 66   ANGLE - SHERMAN                                              66 
turns toward the car, and bumps into Henry.     They both fall down. 67   ANGLE - ROLAND                                               67 
gets to his feet and moves toward the car. 68   ANGLE - MARIA                                                68 opens the car door for Sherman. MARIA Sherman, get in this car.

KRAMER I see.   Well... 
BACON Now, on judgment day, I am your safety valve. Because when it blows -- and it will, my friend -- how grateful you will be that I am on your side -- the one nigger who can control the steam and save your lily white ass from being burned off the face of the earth so to speak. (CONTINUED)

No response. SHERMAN Have you ever thought, I mean, what if we moved out of New York? What do you think? JUDY About what? (CONTINUED)

SHERMAN My father did it. JDUY You are not your father. PETER FALLOW (V.O.) She knew how to hurt a guy. No. He was nothing like his father. His father, the lion of Dunning, Sponget and Leach. His father, who took the subway to work every day of his life. His father, who still believed in principals and ethics, whose repeated lessons concerning duty, debt and responsibility had whistled through his son's head. No. Sherman McCoy was nothing like his father. 102   EXT. BEACH HOUSE - PORCH - DAY                                102 
Sherman and Judy are having drinks with Sherman's FATHER and MOTHER. Over the following, Campbell is tugging at Judy's sleeve, asking repeatedly, "But what does he do? What does Daddy do?!" To which, Judy replies, "He sells bonds." Sherman is, at the same time, searching through a newspaper for any news of the accident. MRS. McCOY (MOTHER) ... And she said to me, 'I like my older customers best of all. They're the only ones who drink anymore.' 
Everyone laughs. MRS. McCOY 'My older customers!' 
MR. McCOY (FATHER) She thought you were twenty-five. (to Judy) All of a sudden I'm married to a white ribbon. (CONTINUED)

CAMPBELL But what's a bond? 
MRS. McCOY (delighted) Oh, yes, Sherman, do explain it. 
MR. McCOY Yes. Your mother and I really want to hear this, Sherman. SHERMAN A bond is a way of lending   people money.  Let's say you want   to build a road or a hospital   and you need a lot of money. Well,    you issue a bond... CAMPBELL Do you build roads? 
SHERMAN No, I don't actually build them... MR. McCOY I think you're in over your head. More laughter. 
JUDY Here. Let me try. Darling, Daddy doesn't build roads or hospitals or anything, really. Daddy just handles the bonds for the people who raise the money. CAMPBELL That's what he said. Bonds. 
JUDY Yes. See, just imagine that a bond is a slice of cake. Now you didn't bake that cake, but every time you hand somebody a slice of that cake, a little bit comes off, little crumbs fall off. And you're allowed to keep those crumbs. (CONTINUED) 
102   CONTINUED:    (2)                                         102 SHERMAN Crumbs?   Really... 
MR. McCOY (pointedly) And many a man has sold his soul for those little crumbs. 
JUDY (enjoying this) Yes. And that's what Daddy does. He passes somebody else's cake around and picks up the crumbs. But you have to imagine a lot of crumbs. And a great golden cake. And a lot of golden crumbs. And you have to imagine Daddy running around picking up every little golden crumb he can get his hands on. That's what Daddy does. SHERMAN Well, you can call them crumbs if you want to... JUDY That's the best I can do.   Excuse me.

SHERMAN But suppose the other fellow comes                       * forward. I swear there was another one. He was big...                               * 
KILLIAN I believe you. It was a set-up. They were going to take you off. Sounds to me like he's got good reasons not to come forward. You just sit tight. That's what you do.

But I didn't come here to... I mean, I want to pre-empt this whole situation. I don't want it to go any further. KILLIAN What does that mean? 
SHERMAN It means I want to take the initiative. I want to go to the police with Maria -- Mrs. Ruskin -- and just tell them exactly what happened. I mean, I don't know about the law, but I feel morally certain that we did what was right -- in the situation we were in. And I don't see... KILLIAN Ayyyy! You Wall Street honchos are real gamblers. Ayyy! Whaddaya whaddaya! They would devour you. They would eat you up. SHERMAN But why? KILLIAN Forget it's already a political football. Forget the T.V. and Reverend Bacon and Weiss has an election coming up. Forget that and remember that when you work in the D.A.'s office and every day you prosecute people with names like Tiffany Latour and Sancho Rodriguez and Chong Wong and Shabazz Kazan Tamali, you are dying to get your hands on a nice white couple like you and Mrs. Ruskin. Biscuit city, ehhh! You open your mouth and they will arrest you. And they will make a big show out of arresting you. And it will be very unpleasant.

KILLIAN That is guaranteed. Believe me, you do not want to be arrested in the South Bronx. (picks up the phone) Yeah. Oh. Put him on. Yeah? I'll hold. (to Sherman) I need to talk to your friend, Mrs. Ruskin, too. SHERMAN I understand you went to Yale. 
KILLIAN Yeah.     You, too. Huh? SHERMAN What did you think of it? KILLIAN It was okay. As law schools go. They give you the scholarly view. You know. It's terrific for anything you want to do -- as long as it doesn't involve real people. (into phone) Hey, Andruitti, you guinea, how are you? Yeah. Well, I'm sitting here with Sherman McCoy. Yeah. That's right. Well, I don't know if he needs a lawyer. What do you think? (winks at Sherman and smiles) Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. (smile fades) So what does that mean? Okay. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

PETER Mrs. Ruskin? MARIA Yes? 
PETER My name is Peter Fallow. I just wanted to offer my sympathy. MARIA (through tears) How very kind. Did you know Arthur? PETER Ah, well, yes. I was actually quite close to him when he died. MARIA I've reprobated myself over and over again for being away...

Maria turns and looks at him -- hard and cold. 
MARIA Sherman would never tell you that. 
PETER I was hoping you might tell me exactly what happened that night. 
MARIA Look, Mr.... Mr.... PETER Fallow. MARIA ... Peckerhead. I am here for my husband's funeral. Understand? Now go away. Disappear. Disintegrate. She gets into the car.

Killian lets the tape fast forward.        Then... SHERMAN (V.O.) (on tape) I suppose we could still go to the police. We could get a very talented lawyer... 
MARIA (V.O.) (on tape) And put our heads right into the horse's mouth? I'm the one who was driving the car. Don't you think I'm the one who should make the decision? And I say, no. No, Sherman.

KILLIAN No. It's an illegal      tape. Totally illegal. The guy who      did this could go to jail for     this. Now if this were your tape,     it would be legal. But it's not. 
SHERMAN What do you mean, 'my tape'? 
KILLIAN Well, if you were wired and you recorded your own conversation that would be okay. But there is no way that this tape can be used as evidence in a court of law. 
SHERMAN Then what good is it?

JUDGE I'll tell you what justice is not. Justice is not the will of the few and it's not the will of the many. Justice is not politics. Justice is the law. And the law is man's feeble attempt to set down the principles of decency. Decency! And decency is not a deal. Or an angle, or a contract, or a hustle or a campaign or a trick or a bid for sympathy. Decency is not the beast that bays for money, power, dominion, position, votes and blood! Decency is what your mother taught you! Decency is in your bones! Do I make myself clear! Now go home.

ARCHIVE TELEVISION FOOTAGE 
It's Election Day 1997. Up and down the country, the PEOPLE OF BRITAIN, people of all shapes and sizes and denominations, black and white, young and old, are going to the Polls. 
Everyone, that is, except the people that live in... 
EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY 
The most instantly recognisable Palace in the world. 
The Royal Standard, (the flag of heraldic lions and symbolic harp-strings that signals the Monarch's presence), flutters on the roof. 
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM DAY 
We're in a state room at Buckingham Palace. A TV plays in the corner.. 
COMMENTARY ..here's Tony Blair, just 43 years old, arriving at the polling station of his constituency in Sedgefield.." 
QUEEN ELIZABETH II, wearing formal robes of the Garter, is posing for an official portrait by an elderly black PORTRAIT ARTIST, (representative, one assumes, of one of the many Charities of which she is patron).. 
ELIZABETH Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford? 
ARTIST 
(proudly dabbing palette) Yes, Ma'am. I was there when they opened. First in line. Seven o'clock. 
COMMENTARY 
If he wins, he'll be the youngest Prime Minister in almost two hundred years.." 
He straightens.. 
ARTIST And I don't mind telling you, it wasn't for Mr Blair. 
ELIZABETH Not a moderniser, then? 
ARTIST Certainly not. We're in danger of losing too much that's good about this country as it is. 
TV COMMENTARY "The only questions that still remain: how big will his landslide be? And how extensive, how sweeping will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in?" 
ELIZABETH Hmm. 
The QUEEN watches as he paints.. 
ELIZABETH I rather envy you being able to vote. (a beat) Not the actual ticking of the box, although, I suppose, it would be nice to experience that ONCE. (a beat) But the sheer joy of being partial. 
ARTIST Yes.. 
The ARTIST squints as he scrutinises the canvass.. 
ARTIST One forgets that as Sovereign, you are not entitled to vote. 
ELIZABETH No. 
ARTIST Still, you won't catch me feeling sorry for you. You might not be allowed to vote, Ma'am.. (a beat) But it IS your Government. 
ELIZABETH Yes. 
The QUEEN raises her eyebrow.. 
ELIZABETH I suppose that is some consolation. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
The QUEEN's face. Fast asleep. It's shortly before 8.00 am. Daylight filters through the curtains. As does something else.. 
The QUEEN's face puckers in distaste.. 
ELIZABETH Oh. I'm not sure I like the sound of that. (a beat) Have we sent him a protocol sheet? 
EXT. MALL - DAY

The motorcade sweeps into the grand, inner quadrangle of Buckingham Palace, and stops at the King's door. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Three secret service BODYGUARDS leap out and open the car doors. TONY looks out at the palace.. 
TONY Funny, I'm actually rather nervous. 
HERIE hy? You've met her often enough before. 
TONY I know. But never one to one. And never as Prime Minister. 
CHERIE Remember, you're a man that's just been elected by the whole country. T TONY Yes. But she's still, y'know.. 
TONY looks up at the vast palace in front of him.. 
TONY The Queen. 
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CORRIDOR/STAIRCASE - DAY 
A uniformed EQUERRY leads TONY and CHERIE through corridors, and up a grand staircase.. 
EQUERRY When we reach the audience room, I will knock. We will not wait to be called, we will go straight inside. Standing by the door, we bow. From the neck. I will introduce you. The Queen will extend her hand, you go to her, bow again, then shake her hand. 
TONY shoots his cuffs, `Right', clears his throat. 
QUERRY (cont'd) Couple of other things. It's `Ma'am' as in ham, not Ma'am as in farm. 
TONY Yes.. 
EQUERRY And when you're in the Presence, at no point must you show your back. 
TONY The `Presence'? 
EQUERRY Yes, Sir. That's what it's called, when you're in her Majesty's company. 
TONY turns, shoots a look at CHERIE, who sticks her fingers down her throat. TONY smiles back.. 
The EQUERRY reaches a grand door, and knocks gently. Without waiting for a reply, he enters.. 
CHERIE is left in the corridor. Alone. She stares at a liveried FOOTMAN. 
He stares back. No life behind his eyes. CHERIE takes a seat on a chair. Eyes widen to herself. 
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - AUDIENCE ROOM - DAY 
TONY and the EQUERRY enter, and gently bow their heads. The EQUERRY then straightens, and announces..

he QUEEN's FACE in close-up. Her eyes flicker as she watches something intently. 
e REVERSE ANGLE to see: a half-open door. SILHOUETTES inside. The sound of male voices. Whispering. Speaking softly. 
It's the moment the BOYS are being told. We make out the SILHOUETTES hugging. The sound of tears. Soft voices. CHARLES repeatedly kissing his SONS. 
ur CAMERA stays on the QUEEN's FACE. A distant flicker of pain at the unrestrained intimacy and affection between them. 
Presently, the door opens, and a red-eyed PRINCE CHARLES emerges. 
C 
CHARLES They're going to go back to sleep. (clears his throat, speaks with difficulty) Well, try anyway. 
The QUEEN goes up to CHARLES and stiffly, poignantly, tries to touch him. But cannot. Is unable. She withdraws her hand. 
CHARLES (reading the message) My Private Secretary's office has found a travel agency open in New York that will sell me a flight to Paris with an hour's stop over in Manchester. 
CHARLES contains himself with difficulty.. 
CHARLES Perhaps now you might consider whether it's still an extravagance to bring back the mother of the future King of England in one of our planes? 
ELIZABETH (after a long pause) All right. 
HARLES's eyes burn. He turns, and walks out. 
The QUEEN is left alone. She stares for a moment, then leaves, passing a FOOTMAN. 
ELIZABETH (to FOOTMAN) I don't want the boys to see the news and get upset. First thing tomorrow morning, I want the radio taken out of their bedroom, and the television taken out of the nursery. 
The FOOTMAN bows.. 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - QUEEN'S BEDCHAMBER - VERY EARLY DAWN 
The QUEEN sits in bed, writing her diary, in a bedchamber where the decor is unchanged in a hundred years.. O utside, the sound of bird-song. The first rays of light. 
The DUKE OF EDINBURGH sticks his head around the corner. He looks at the QUEEN.. 
PRINCE PHILIP Well, well, well.

ALASTAIR shoots a mischievous look.. 
ALASTAIR Ask her if SHE greased the brakes.

he QUEEN, PRINCE PHILIP and the QUEEN MOTHER sit in silence at the table, eating breakfast, stoically listening to radio coverage, soberly flicking through newspapers.. 
The QUEEN is the only one who is fully dressed, (the others in bathrobes), and she wears black. She is reading "The Sunday Times". 
All around them the QUEEN's (elderly) MAIDS perform the choreography of service as the radio coverage continues. One MAID pours tea. Another brings fresh toast. 
Also present is the rather smarter VALET and MAID belonging to the PRINCE of WALES, and his separate HOUSEHOLD. They have a separate, (and more stylish), uniform of their own. T hey set CHARLES's place and his breakfast, (nuts, grains, healthy food).

TONY Is it your intention to make some kind of appearance. Or statement? 
ELIZABETH Certainly not. 
INT. BALMORAL - QUEEN'S STUDY - DAY 
The QUEEN's face, bristling at the suggestion. (WE INTERCUT AS NECESSARY).. 
ELIZABETH No member of the Royal family will speak publicly about this. It is a private matter and we would all appreciate it if it could be respected as such. 
TONY I see. 
TONY straightens, taken aback.. 
TONY I don't suppose anyone has had time to think about the funeral yet? 
ELIZABETH We've spoken to the Spencer family, and it's their wish.. (a beat) ..their express wish, that it should be a private funeral. With a memorial service to follow in a month, or so.

JANVRIN watches the broadcast on television, surrounded by several MEMBERS OF STAFF - MAIDS, COOKS, VALETS, FOOTMEN, all craning their necks, watching the television in the Private Secretary's room.. 
Our camera stays on JANVRIN's face, as TONY's speech continues.. 
TONY (ON TV) They liked her, they loved her, they regarded her as one of the people. She was the people's princess, and that is how she will stay, how she will remain in our hearts and memories forever.." J ANVRIN's eyes roll privately..

Two and a half-hours on whether she should be carried in a hearse or a gun-carriage. (taps head, "Nuts") Anyway, raves in the press. 
ALASTAIR dumps the papers on the desk.. 
ALASTAIR This lot call you "The Nation's Mourner in Chief", this lot say you're "The only person who has correctly judged the mood of the country". Even the "Mail".. (disdainfully holding the paper between finger and thumb) ..was impressed. 
ALASTAIR drops the papers on TONY's desk. 
JANVRIN Indeed, and the Lord Chamberlain was at pains to stress the spirit of the occasion will be quite different. a beat) For example, in place of four hundred soldiers marching behind the coffin, the suggestion is that four hundred representatives from the Princess's various charities march behind the coffin. 
ELIZABETH I see.. 
The QUEEN MOTHER's eyes widen..

The QUEEN looks ashen. The QUEEN MOTHER is pouring herself a drink.. 
ELIZABETH (cont'd) Wa..was there anything else? 
JANVRIN o, Ma'am.

he QUEEN looks up.. 
ELIZABETH W hat flowers?

TONY comes back to take the dirty plates.. 
TONY But spare me the whole.."off with their heads" thing.

CHERIE "The case for reform is simple and obvious. It is in principle wrong and absurd that people should wield power on the basis of birth, not merit or election." (a beat) YOUR words, not mine. 
TONY is momentarily thrown.. 
TONY Well, maybe now I've grown up. a beat) It's unimaginable this country being a republic. Certainly in her lifetime. 
CHERIE Why? 
TONY Because...no would would wear it. (can't help laughing at the idea) No one WANTS it. (gestures) It's just...daft. 
TONY heads for the door.. 
HERIE It's not a mother thing, is it? 
TONY turns.. 
CHERIE Think about it. If she were still alive, wouldn't Hazel be exactly the same age? Whenever you talk about your mother, you mention her stoicism. Her frugality. Her sense of duty. The fact she was brought up in the way. Well c'mon..? (a beat) Who does THAT sound like?

ELIZABETH Yes, perfectly, thank you. I'm so sorry to waste your time.. 
HEAD GHILIE We'll come out straightaway. 
ELIZABETH Oh, will you? You are kind. Thank you. a beat) I'll wait by the car. 
The QUEEN hangs up. Puts the phone away, then opens the Land Rover's door. 
EXT. HIGHLANDS - RIVER DEE - DAY 
The QUEEN gingerly climbs out of the Land Rover, and walks across the stones to the river bank, getting her shoes wet. 
EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY 
The QUEEN sits on a stone by the stranded Land Rover. She sits in silence.. 
othing but the sound of running water, wind in the trees, and birdsong. 
Ah, that's good. 
he QUEEN closes her eyes. All around her, silence except for the sounds of the great outdoors. 
Privacy at last. The first moment of silence in what feels like months. The QUEEN breathes deeply. It's all been a bit much. 
o time to think. 
ne shock after another. 
veryone shouting. 
ll far too dramatic. 
ome to think of it, this is the first time she's been able to.. 
Suddenly, almost imperceptibly, we notice her shoulders are shaking. Not dramatically, but enough to suggest what is happening. The QUEEN - away from the world - is crying. W e only see her back. Presently, she reaches into her jacket pocket, produces a handkerchief, and dabs her eyes. Gradually, she composes herself. 
That's better. 
on't want to make a fuss. 
he GILLIES will be here soon. 
The QUEEN takes a deep breath. That's better. 
resently the sound of rustling leaves, and the unmistakable sense that she is being watched. Strange.. 
The QUEEN turns to have a look, then almost drops the cup.. 
Standing in front of her, no more than twenty yards, is the STAG. 
The QUEEN freezes, hardly dare breathe. It is enormous. His antlers are bigger and more dramatic than she could have imagined. 
MOURNER 1 (ON TV) Hamburg. 
TV INTERVIEWER (ON TV) Hamburg, Germany? 
OURNER 1 (ON TV) Well, I just had to be here. She was such a wonderful woman.. P RINCE PHILIP What? 
MOURNER 2 (ON TV) She was an angel.. 
PRINCE PHILIP ...and a hysteric. 
MOURNER 3 (ON TV) o compassionate, and caring.. 
PRINCE PHILIP Oh, please.. 
PHILIP indicates the television.. 
PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd) Sleeping in the streets and pulling out their hair for someone they never knew? 
He shoots a quizzical look.. 
PRINCE PHILIP And they think we're mad? 
PHILIP turns to the QUEEN.. 
PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd) Have you seen the latest funeral guest list? 
ELIZABETH No. 
PRINCE PHILIP I suggest you keep it that way. A chorus line of soap stars and homosexuals. (a beat) (MORE) 
PRINCE PHILIP(cont'd) Apparently Elton John is going to be singing. 
The QUEEN's eyes close. It's agony. 
PRINCE PHILIP That'll be a first for Westminster Abbey. 
The QUEEN stares distractedly at the television.. 
PRINCE PHILIP Condolence books are now being signed in our embassies in every major city in the world. a beat) And in London alone the number has reached forty. 
fter a beat.. 
PRINCE PHILIP stares at the CROWDS of MOURNERS on the television) This reminds me of one of those films. A few of us in a Fort. Hordes of Zulus outside. 
P silence. The TELEVISION coverage continues.. 
RINCE PHILIP So it's VITAL you hold firm. Stick to your guns. You wait. They will come to their senses soon. a beat) They HAVE to. 
PHILIP climbs into bed beside the QUEEN.. 
PRINCE PHILIP C'mon, move over, Cabbage. 
The QUEEN stares at the TV. Staring at a modern Britain, a modern world she no longer understands. 
EXT. HIGHLANDS - NIGHT 
A bright, full moon. The unmistakable silhouette of THE STAG walks slowly across the blue-white orb - until he reaches a river.. 
There, he stops, and bellows imperiously into the night. 
ADE TO BLACK: 
INT. DOWNING STREET - BEDROOM - DAY 
The following morning. 
6.30 am. TONY watches from his bed. The pastel-coloured set of `GOOD MORNING TV'. The hosts, a MAN and WOMAN in their forties, sit on a sofa. The MAN turns to the camera.. T ELEVISION PRESENTER It's six o'clock. Time for a look at the morning's newspapers. Jenny.. 
WE CUT TO: a smiling woman in her thirties, who sits at a coffee table which is covered in newspapers.. 
JENNY Good morning. Well if you thought yesterday's headlines for the Royals couldn't get any worse - think again. 
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - QUEEN'S BEDROOOM - DAY 
TONY takes a breath. Knows this won't be easy.

The QUEEN stares. 
ELIZABETH (cont'd) Swift prosecution of these matters, he felt, might, just might avert disaster. E 
XT. BALMORAL GROUNDS - DAY 
he QUEEN and QUEEN MOTHER walk through the grounds: stout, resolute, waterproofs, rain. A glorious Scottish summer. Distant rumbles of thunder...

ELIZABETH I have. 
UEEN MOTHER And to Robert Fellowes. 
ELIZABETH To him too. 
UEEN MOTHER And..? 
ELIZABETH (cont'd) It seems they both agree with him. 
A silence. 
QUEEN MOTHER I see. 
he QUEEN stares. Then.. 
ELIZABETH Something's happened. There's been a change...a shift of values.. 
The QUEEN looks up.. 
ELIZABETH (cont'd) When you no longer understand your people, isn't it time to hand over to the next generation? 
QUEEN MOTHER Certainly not! Remember the oath you took 
ELIZABETH "I declare that my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service." 
QUEEN MOTHER Your WHOLE life. That's a commitment to God as well as your people. 
ELIZABETH But if my actions are damaging the crown? 
QUEEN MOTHER Damaging them? My dear, you are the greatest asset this institution has. One of the greatest it has EVER had. The problem will come when you leave, but that's not for you to worry about - and certainly not today. 
TONY sits with his feet up, doing his boxes, signing papers, and half watching television at the same time. 
ON SCREEN: the QUEEN and the Royals doing their photo-call. The voice of the NEWS READER at Channel Four.. 
NEWS READER (ON T.V.) We are just getting some pictures now from Balmoral. These are rather historic shots. Clearly the Queen has responded to criticism that the Royal Family is not engaged.. T TONY looks up. Breathes a sigh of relief.. 
TONY (to himself) Thank God for that. 
From the kitchen: CHERIE's voice.. 
CHERIE (cont'd) It's fish-fingers. Want any? 
TONY Be right there. 
TONY finishes signing the papers. Turns off the TV. Walks into the kitchen. We hear CHERIE's voice as the door closes.. 
CHERIE I'm afraid they're a bit burned. 
FADE TO BLACK 
EXT. BALMORAL - DAY 
The PIPER SERGEANT walks around the castle perimeter playing the bag-pipes.

The QUEEN comes downstairs to the first landing where bags are being brought out of the rooms by MAIDS and VALETS P RINCE PHILIP Where are the boys? Have they already left? 
ELIZABETH Yes. They left for London after breakfast. With Charles. 
HILIP shakes his head.. 
PRINCE PHILIP It's not right, you know 
ELIZABETH Yes, but further discussion is no longer helpful either. 
The QUEEN heads downstairs.   PHILIP follows... 
PRINCE PHILIP Oh, well. I suppose it gives the ghillies time to find a new stag for the boys now theirs has been shot. 
ELIZABETH What? 
The QUEEN momentarily stiffens.. 
PRINCE PHILIP Haven't you heard? It wandered onto one of the neighbouring estates where it was shot by one of the commercial guests. 
ELIZABETH Really..? 
The blood has drained from her face.. 
ELIZABETH (cont'd) Which estate? 
EXT. BALMORAL - COURTYARD - DAY 
The QUEEN, pulling an old Barbour over her black dress, emerges into a courtyard where the royal cars are being loaded with bags for the trip.

They drive out of the Balmoral Estate. 
INT. DOWNING STREET - BLAIR OFFICE - DAY 
TONY sits at his desk working on his speech. A knock on the door. ALASTAIR CAMPBELL enters..

The QUEEN's face. She staring out of the window, dying a thousand deaths inside, on her way to RAF NORTHOLT in London. She is aboard the private jet belonging to the Queen's Flight, sitting opposite her is the QUEEN MOTHER 
n the table in between them are all the morning's NEWSPAPERS with their humiliating headlines. 
A shadow passes across her. The sound of a clearing throat. The QUEEN looks up. It's ROBIN JANVRIN. She snaps out of it. E ELIZABETH Yes, Robin.. 
She puts on her glasses. Composure returns. Professional again. 
JANVRIN I've done a draft of your television address. 
ELIZABETH Thank you. 
ANVRIN puts it down. He notices all the NEWSPAPERS. 
ELIZABETH (cont'd) Was there anything else? 
JANVRIN opens his mouth, wants to say something to comfort her..but realises it would be inappropriate. 
JANVRIN No, Ma'am. Landing in fifteen minutes.

The CAR carrying the QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP sweeps into the MALL.

A SECRETARY walks in.. 
SECRETARY I've got a copy of the Queen's speech. 
She passes it over to ALASTAIR.. 
SECRETARY Shall I give Tony a copy? 
LASTAIR Let me have a look at it first. 
ALASTAIR starts reading it.. 
INT. CAR - SAME TIME - ARCHIVE / RECONSTITUTED ARCHIVE 
The QUEEN and PHILIP stare out of the car. For the first time, they get an idea of the actual size and scale of the CROWDS.. 
PRINCE PHILIP (jaw drops) Good God.. 
The QUEEN stares in fear and disbelief at the people lining the MALL. In places, the CROWDS are standing twenty deep. 
he FACES are reflected in the car windows. Are they hostile? Are they people she understands? Camera flashlights pop. 
NT. DOWNING STREET - ALASTAIR'S OFFICE - SAME TIME 
ALASTAIR makes a change to the Queen's speech. We CLOSE on the text as he writes, inserting... 
"..speaking as a Grandmother".. 
In the background, on TV: we see the QUEEN's car pulls up. The doors open, the QUEEN gets out.. 
Unaware her words are being edited by her Government. 
T EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY - LIVE 
he QUEEN steps out into the crowds.. 
INT. DOWNING STREET - MONITORING ROOM - DAY

ELIZABETH Right 
DIRECTOR And you'll be at the front of the six o'clock news on all the channels 
ELIZABETH I see. 
The QUEEN is led over to where the DIRECTOR has placed a chair and table in front of the cameras and lights.. 
FLOOR MANAGER (calling out) Ten seconds, everyone.. 
The QUEEN sits at her desk. Final touches from hair and make- up. The MALL is clearly visible. The QUEEN holds the speech in front of her.. 
DIRECTOR (cont'd) Five, four.. 
We close on the QUEEN's face, and.. 
ELIZABETH Since last Saturday's dreadful news we have seen, throughout Britain and the world, an overwhelming expression of sadness at Diana's death.. 
WATCHING FROM THE WINGS: 
PRINCE PHILIP and PRINCE CHARLES watch. PHILIP clenches his jaw muscles in irritation. I 
NT. CHINESE ROOM - SAME TIME 
he QUEEN continues.. 
ELIZABETH We have all been trying in our different ways to cope. The initial shock is often succeeded by a mixture of other feelings. Disbelief, incomprehension, anger and concern for those who remain. 
INT. DOWNING STREET - SAME TIME 
TONY and CHERIE BLAIR watch from their apartment.. 
ELIZABETH (ON TV) We have all felt these emotions in these last few days. So what I say to you now, as your Queen and as a grandmother, I say from my heart... 
TONY flinches in sympathy as she says the line. CHERIE notices this, then.. 
CHERIE "Heart"? What "heart". She doesn't mean a word of this. 
TONY That's not the point. What she's doing is extraordinary. (points to the TV) That's how you survive. 
CHERIE turns, and stares.. 
CHERIE Listen to you! A week ago you were the great moderniser, making speeches about the "People's Princess", now you've gone weak at the knees. 
TONY bristles with irritation.. 
CHERIE I don't know why I'm surprised. In the end, all Labour Prime Ministers go ga- ga for her Maj. 
ELIZABETH (ON TV) I hope that tomorrow we can all, wherever we are, join in expressing our grief at Diana's loss, and gratitude for her all-too-short life. 
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM - SAME TIME 
The QUEEN draws to a close. Her face is inscrutable. The DIRECTOR prepares his CREW to wind up.. 
ELIZABETH (cont'd) May those who died rest in peace and may we, each and every one of us.. 
CLOSE-UP OF THE QUEEN: 
ELIZABETH (cont'd) ..thank God for someone who made many, many people happy. 
The QUEEN holds her expression for the camera. Then.. 
DIRECTOR (calls out) And we're out..! 
The QUEEN's face relaxes. As does everyone in the room. A huge, collective breathing out. D IRECTOR (cont'd) Thank you, your Majesty. 
But the QUEEN doesn't acknowledge him. She removes her clip- mike, and hands it to the DIRECTOR.. 
..then walks over to a waiting PRINCE PHILIP, who protectively extends an arm. The QUEEN and PRINCE PHILIP leave the room. People are left staring awkwardly at one another.. 
OVER THIS: we FADE IN the sound of a haunting, elegiac hymn.. 
INT. WESTMINSTER ABBEY - DAY 
TONY (cont'd) And the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I spoke to the Prime Minister of Malawi, who was saying how much he appreciated your tough stance on Nigeria. 
Silence. 
TONY I meant to tell you at the time but you were being monopolised rather. 
ilence. 
TONY I imagine those occasions are quite difficult. Twenty-four heads of Government each clamouring for a private audience.. 
Silence. TONY takes a deep breath, then.. 
TONY Also, we haven't had a chance to speak since THAT week. And I wanted to offer my apologies.. 
The QUEEN looks up.. 
ELIZABETH Whatever for? 
TONY In case you'd felt `manhandled' or `managed' in any way. 
ELIZABETH Not at all. 
beat. 
ELIZABETH I don't think I shall ever understand what happened this summer. 
TONY The circumstances were exceptional, Ma'am. And in the end, you showed great personal strength, courage, and humility.   E ELIZABETH ou're confusing humility with humiliation. 
TONY That's not true. 
ELIZABETH You didn't hear what they were saying in the Mall that Friday. 
TONY I still believe History will show it was a good week for you. 
ELIZABETH And an even better one for you, Mr Blair. 
TONY But there are fifty-two weeks in a year, Ma'am. And two and a half thousand in a half century. 
The QUEEN looks up. Thrown by his compliment.. 
TONY And when people come to assess your legacy, no one will remember those few days. 
ELIZABETH Really? 
ELIZABETH You don't feel that what respect or affection people might once have had for.. 
She wants to say `Me', but instead says.. 
ELIZABETH ..this institution has been diminished? 
TONY Not at all. 
pause.. 
ELIZABETH I gather some of your closest advisors were less fulsome in their support.. 
TONY One or two. But as a leader one has...a different perspective. a beat) I could never have added my voice to the chorus. 
ELIZABETH You're very kind. 
The QUEEN looks at TONY, raises an eyebrow.. 
ELIZABETH But let's also not forget the more pragmatic reason. 
TONY Which is? 
ELIZABETH That without me there to distract everyone, it'd suddenly become embarrassingly clear how much unchecked power the British Prime Minister actually has. 
TONY looks up.. 
ELIZABETH If fifty years of doing MY job has taught me anything, it is that the people doing YOURS generally prefer me with all my faults to some kind of meddling President.. (a beat) Just look at the French. 
The QUEEN opens her handbag, and takes out her reading glasses..            E ELIZABETH (cont'd) I suppose we'd better get on with the business in hand..

1   EXT. THE OCEAN - DAY                                              1 
CLOSE ON a beautiful 40-YEAR-OLD WOMAN at the helm of a powerful SPEEDBOAT -- her hair tossed back by the wind, her mouth in a euphoric grin. 
FADE OUT.

MATT (V.O.) My missionary ancestors came to the islands and told the Hawaiians to put on clothes, work hard, believe in Christ, and stop surfing and hula dancing. They made business deals along the way -- buying an island, or marrying a princess and inheriting her land. Now their descendants wear bikinis and running shorts, play beach volleyball and surf, and take up hula dancing. Hawai'i has always been a place of contradiction. 
3   EXT. HONOLULU - DAY                                               3 
VARIOUS SHOTS of Honolulu begin a pattern of montages to be interspersed throughout the film. 
MATT (V.O.) My friends on the mainland think just because I live in Hawai'i, I live in paradise. Like a permanent vacation -- we're all just out here drinking mai- tais, shaking our hips, and catching waves. Are they nuts? How can they possibly think our families are less screwed up, our heart attacks and cancers less fatal, our grief less devastating? Hell, I haven't been on a surfboard in fifteen years.

We ZOOM BACK from a panorama of Honolulu to find 50-year-old MATT KING seated amid DOCUMENTS atop a makeshift desk -- he has brought his work with him.

MATT (V.O.) For the last 23 days, I've been living in a "paradise" of IVs and urine bags and endotracheal tubes and six-month- old US magazines. Paradise. Paradise can go fuck itself. 
Matt looks up at the WOMAN we saw in the speedboat, now lying stiffly on an upright HOSPITAL BED, her head cocked to one side, a feeding tube in her nose, a ventilator in her trachea, IVs in her arm. 
MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D) This is Elizabeth King, my wife. Twenty-three days ago she was launched from a powerboat during a race and hit her head, almost drowned. Now she's in a coma that scores 5 on the Glasgow scale and 3 on the Rancho Los Amigos scale, scores showing an extremely severe coma. Liz is very competitive. Whatever she does, she does to the fullest. 
5   INT. NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                                     5 
Matt is getting the current DIAGNOSIS. 
NEUROLOGIST She reacts non-purposefully to stimuli in a non-specific manner, but occasionally her responses are specific, though inconsistent. Her reflexes are primitive and often the same, regardless of stimuli presented... 
MATT (V.O.) It was exactly what Elizabeth used to accuse me of. 
6   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                            6 
Matt continues to observe her. 
MATT (V.O.) Twenty-three days in a coma, and any day now the doctors will give me their final verdict if she's going to come out of it or not. Then I have a decision to make. Wait, that's wrong. Liz has a living will. (MORE)

His CELLPHONE RINGS. 
MATT (CONT'D) Hi, Noe, what's up? 
NOE (ON PHONE) Matt, you have a call from Scottie's teacher. She says it's urgent. 
MATT Yeah, sure. Put her on. 
7   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY                              7 
A SCRAPBOOK shows PHOTOS OF ELIZABETH lying in her hospital bed. The compositions are odd, the ANGLES uncomfortably CLOSE. 
WIDE -- 
Matt confers with fifth-grade teacher MS. Hayashi and school counselor MRS. THULL. 
MS. HAYASHI We just don't think these photographs are appropriate for Scottie to be sharing with her classmates. Some of them went home quite disturbed, and we got some angry calls from parents. 
MATT Yeah, she's sort of been going to town with the whole picture-taking thing, but I had no idea -- 
MS. HAYASHI I can't tell you how my heart goes out to you and your family, but Scottie just hasn't been herself. Principal Cruz agrees with us that it maybe would be better for Scottie to remain at home with you during this difficult time. 
MATT Home. See, I would think that sticking to her normal routine would be the best thing for her -- you know, keep her occupied. I wouldn't really know how to...

And her sister's away at school on the Big Island. I don't think Scottie would really want to hang out with me when she could be with her friends and people like you who specialize in children. 
MRS. THULL Mr. King, we see this every day -- children acting out at school when something's wrong at home. And your family is facing a devastating crisis. Have you been engaging Scottie in really talking about what's going on? Encouraging her to express her feelings? That's crucial. 
MATT (No) Oh, yeah.   Yeah.   Absolutely. 
SCOTTIE (O.S.) (singing) This shit is bananas. B-a-n-a-n-a-s. This shit is bananas. 
They look over to see -- 
SCOTTIE I'm starving. And I'm thirsty.          I want a soda. 
He takes Scottie by the hand and sits her down in a chair next to the bed. 
MATT We're not leaving until you talk to her. I'll even give you privacy. Recite her the alphabet for all I care. What do you want to drink? 
SCOTTIE Sprite. 
MATT OK, Sprite. Diet Sprite? 
SCOTTIE Not diet.    Regular.   Do you think I'm fat? 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 9    CONTINUED: (2)                                                       9 
MATT No, you're not fat. 
SCOTTIE I'm not the model. 
MATT It's just that all that sugar makes you cranky. 
SCOTTIE I'm not cranky! 
MATT Okay.     I'll be right back.    Talk. 
10   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                          10 
As Matt steps out into the hallway, he passes NURSE JOY. 
NURSE JOY Mr. King, how are you? 
MATT Fine, Joy, fine.     And you? 
NURSE JOY I see your picture in the paper today. Have you made your decision yet? 
MATT My decision? 
NURSE JOY Your family. About your big land. 
The other NURSE nudges Joy to be more polite. 
NURSE JOY (CONT'D) What?     Me and Mr. King, we're like this. 
MATT Well, it's not really my decision. It's my whole family's decision. And furthermore... (mock scolding) ... mind your own business, young lady. 
As he turns away to continue down the hall -- 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft      4/11/10 Draft 10   CONTINUED:                                                               10 
MATT (V.O) (CONT'D) The whole goddamned state is following my decision on who's going to buy 35,000 acres on Kaua'i my family has owned since the 1860s. My cousins and I meet in six days to approve a buyer. Ever since my father died nine years ago, I'm the sole trustee, the controlling trustee, so I hold all the cards. Why does so much have to depend on me -- my wife, my daughters, my family's land? I just want to hide. 
11   INT. HOSPITAL GIFT SHOP - DAY                                            11 
A POSTCARD shows a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL in a bikini straddling a surfboard, laughing as she's splashed. 
Barely containing his rage, Matt stares at postcard before grabbing ALL THE POSTCARDS in that rack. 
AT THE COUNTER -- 
About to pay for the postcards and two SODAS, Matt notices a HEADLINE atop a stack of NEWSPAPERS: "Activists Continue Protest of Kaua'i Sale." 
SHOPKEEPER Hey, they all the same cards.      You like buy all the same cards? 
MATT These are inappropriate for a hospital gift shop. This girl is underage. Why do you sell postcards like this? This is a hospital. These aren't get-well cards. 
The SHOPKEEPER blinks at the man weirdly accosting her. 
SHOPKEEPER You like buy all the cards?       Or you want I put them back? 
MATT (pulling out his wallet) Never mind. Yes, I'm buying them.          And these two sodas. 
As she rings him up --

SHOPKEEPER Okay, you buy underage girl all for yourself. 
In the lobby just outside the store, he drops the stack of postcards into the GARBAGE. 
12   INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWAY - DAY                                        12 
Forgoing the elevator -- perhaps to squeeze in a little exercise -- Matt trudges upstairs. 
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.) I don't care about the backstory, Mr. King. My daughter comes home from school in tears. 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 17   CONTINUED:                                                           17 
MATT Yeah, no, I get it.    I'm very sorry. 
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.) Scottie should be the one who's sorry. I want her to come over and apologize to Lani, and I don't ever want her to write to my daughter again. 
LANI (DISTANT O.S.) She can in a good way. 
BARB HIGGINS (O.S.) If she doesn't apologize, I'm going to tell the headmaster. You can't buy your way out of this. 
Matt draws a long exasperated breath, as if everything else weren't enough already. 
MATT (V.O.) See what I mean? Everybody sees me as the rich guy, the inheritor. People resent us. I resent us. Even our last name -- King. How irritating. 
18   INT. MATT'S CAR - DAY                                                18 
Matt drives Scottie. 
MATT You need to say you're sorry, and you need to mean it. No dicking around. I have a ton of work to do tonight. Do you have any idea how behind I am? You made her cry. Why would you want to be so mean to someone? 
SCOTTIE (irritated) I don't know! 
MATT Is that what you text all the time, nasty things? 
SCOTTIE No. 
MATT Well, what then? 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 18   CONTINUED:                                                          18 
SCOTTIE I write them with Reina. They make her laugh, and then she shows Megan and Brooke, and they laugh too. 
MATT I should have known Reina had something to do with it. I don't want you hanging out with her. 
SCOTTIE Wait, I told Reina she could visit me in the hospital since I'm not in school anymore. Can she? 
MATT We'll make a deal. You apologize to this girl, and you talk to your mother, and then we'll see about Reina dropping by the hospital. Okay? 
Something outside the window catches Scottie's attention. 
SCOTTIE Dorks! 
Matt looks to see -- 
SIX FAMILY MEMBERS, walking on the sidewalk with KAYAKS, wearing T-SHIRTS reading "Melnick Family Reunion." 
SCOTTIE (CONT'D) Dorks! 
MATT Scottie, knock it off! 
Scottie sits back in her seat, laughing. Matt glances in his rearview mirror to see a TEENAGE SON taking off his T-shirt and throwing it to the ground. 
19   EXT. LANI'S HOUSE - KAIMUKI - LATE AFTERNOON                        19 
The car drives down a block of MODEST HOMES. 
SCOTTIE Her house is down there on the corner. 
MATT You've been here before? 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft    4/11/10 Draft 19   CONTINUED:                                                           19 
SCOTTIE Yea-uh. She invites me to her birthday, like, every year. 
MATT So you guys are actually friends? 
SCOTTIE Until last year's party, when she locked me out of the house and I had to sit outside all day while everybody was inside. She thought she was so great, but then I became friends with Reina and Brooke and got popular. 
MATT (processing) What? 
20   EXT. LANI'S FRONT PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON                             20 
BARB HIGGINS answers the door. 
BARB HIGGINS Thank you for coming by. 
21   INT. LANI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                       21 
As Matt and Scottie are shown inside, they remove their shoes. 
VERY CLOSE ON MATT -- 
MATT (V O.) (CONT'D) I just want to be a normal guy.

25   INT. MATT'S LAW OFFICE - DAY                                      25 
Matt eats a SACK LUNCH at his desk. His window has a grand view of DOWNTOWN. We glimpse his Punahou, college and law school DIPLOMAS. 
MATT (V.O.) Unlike a lot of my cousins, I haven't touched my share of the trust money. Like my father before me, I live only on the income from my law practice. I don't want my daughters growing up entitled and spoiled. And I agree with my father -- you give your children enough money to do something but not enough to do nothing. 
Matt's secretary NOE cracks open his door. 
NOE Mr. King, your cousins are here. 
26   INT. LAW OFFICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                             26 
Matt enters the room to find SEVEN COUSINS waiting to greet him. From their casual clothing and shaggy hair, an observer might hardly suspect their status. 
MATT (V.O.) Not only am I the sole but I'm a commercial real estate and transactional attorney, so the most involved of my cousins have been meeting with me regularly to analyze the bids -- Cousin Dave, Cousin Hal, Cousin Six, Cousin Wink, Cousin Lisa, Cousin Connie and Cousin Stan, both of whom oppose the sale entirely. Don't be fooled by appearances. In Hawai'i some of the most powerful people look like bums and stuntmen. 
LATER -- 
Matt and his cousins stand above the conference table, looking at blueprints and architectural drawings. 
MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D) The proposals are virtually the same -- hotels, shopping centers, condos and golf courses. 3000 new jobs in the first five years. Support letters from the construction industry and unions.

(CONT'D) A Chicago group is offering half a billion dollars, but we're leaning toward a lower bid from a guy named Don Holitzer. He's actually from Kaua'i and made a fortune in Silicon Valley. Cousin Hugh is pushing us in that direction, and I say why not? 
CLOSE ON MATT, nodding along but highly distracted, the sound of Liz's VENTILATOR growing louder in his brain. 
We CUT TO ARTIST'S RENDERINGS of comatose Elizabeth -- wide, closer, closer still, closer.

28   INT. FAMILY CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY                                   28 
Matt sits across from old family friend DR. SAM JOHNSTON. 
DR. JOHNSTON Bad news, Matt. Dr. Chun, Dr. Mueller and I -- we believe her condition,                            * which we call a multi-factorial anoxic                        * encephalopathy, is deteriorating. We                          * see no eye movement, no pupillary                             * response, basically no brainstem                              * reflexes whatsoever. The machines                             * could keep her going, but her quality                         * of life would be... very poor.                                * Basically what you see now. She'll never be like she was, Matt. Never.                           * We know that now. 
Matt sits very still. 
DR. JOHNSTON (CONT'D) I can't tell you how sorry I am to have to tell you this. And you have your daughters. There's just nothing we can do. 
MATT So... if we do go ahead and take her off the machines -- 
DR. JOHNSTON Not if, Matt. When. I have a legal obligation. You know that.

MATT How long will she last? 
DR. JOHNSTON Hard to say. Could be a few days. Could be two weeks. But for planning purposes, you should work off the shortest possible scenario. I know I need to get the ball rolling on organ donations right away. 
Organ donation?     Forgot about that one. 
DR. JOHNSTON (CONT'D) Elizabeth has so many friends, a big life. Last time I was at your house, must have been 200 people. If you're going to let people know to say goodbye, which is fairly typical protocol in these situations, start now. By the time the last day comes, they feel more ready, as ready as they can feel. I'm so sorry, Matt. 
29   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                         29 
His mind spinning, Matt prepares to look at the corpse-to-be. When he opens the door and pulls back the curtain, he finds -- 
30   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     30 
-- friends MARK AND KAI MITCHELL up for a visit. They're playing MUSIC for Elizabeth on a mini-boombox, and Kai is APPLYING MAKE-UP to Liz's face. 
After cheery greetings -- 
MATT What're you doing? 
KAI Oh, she's been looking a little pale lately all cooped up in here, and I just know she'd be mortified if no one had thought to help her out with some lipstick and blush. I know she'll grill me. 
Matt and Mark exchange a look -- "Girls." 
MARK And of course Kai's getting her all caught up on all the latest gossip.

SCOTTIE Just because her hand moved, it doesn't mean anything, Troy. Mom twitches at weird times.   When you cut off a chicken's head, it runs all around, but it's still a dead chicken.

Scottie pushes back from the table and takes off toward the pool. Matt follows, not even gracing Troy with a final look. 
34    EXT. OCEAN OUTRIGGER POOL - CONTINUOUS                               34 
Matt catches up to Scottie. 
MATT Hey, sport, don't pay any attention to that guy. That guy's a dope. 
SCOTTIE I hate him. 
MATT Yeah. 
SCOTTIE I didn't mean to say dead chicken. I don't want Mom to die. 
MATT I know, I know. Hey, let's get out of here. Let's go do something crazy. Like let's drive to the airport and hop over to the Big Island and surprise your sister. What do you say? 
SCOTTIE Right now? 
MATT It'll be fun. She's not expecting us or anything. And we bring her home. I think she should be here with us, don't you? Don't you miss her? I miss her. 
SCOTTIE Yeah, I'm out of school.       She should be too!

Matt and Scottie look out the window at THE BIG ISLAND coming into view. 
MATT (V.O.) Somehow it feels natural to find a daughter of mine on a different island. A family seems exactly like an archipelago -- all part of the same geographic expression but still islands -- separate and alone, always drifting slowly apart.

Matt knocks on a door.     An exhausted Scottie slouches against a wall. 
The DORM SUPERVISOR appears in a nightgown.          The TV is on in the background. 
MATT Hi, sorry to bother you.       I'm Matt King. 
DORM SUPERVISOR Yes, hello, Mr. King. 
MATT I've come to pick up my daughter, Alexandra. 
DORM SUPERVISOR Did you call Administration? 
MATT No, I didn't. It's sort of an emergency.

Scottie runs down the hall, excited by the idea of surprising her sister. 
-- where Matt places Alex on her bed, takes off her shoes, covers her with a blanket, and watches this tsunami of a girl at rest. 
48   INT. KING KITCHEN - DAY                                               48 
At the stove, Matt dishes out SCRAMBLED EGGS.         Scottie sits in the kitchen nook. 
MATT (V.O.) And Scottie, how can I protect her from... me?

As he brings her plate over -- 
SCOTTIE I don't like eggs. 
MATT Why didn't you say so before I made them? 
SCOTTIE I thought they were for you. 
Alex trudges in and pulls a Coca-Cola out of the fridge. 
MATT Good morning. (no answer) Does Mom let you have Coke for breakfast? 
ALEXANDRA I'm pretty sure it's after eleven. 
Now that we get a closer look, we might recognize Alexandra from the postcards at the hospital. We also see a resemblance to her mother. 
MATT How are you feeling? 
Shrugging, she plops down near Scottie. 
MATT (CONT'D) Hungover, huh? Why am I not surprised? I don't know where to start, and we probably shouldn't in front of Scottie. 
SCOTTIE I don't mind. 
MATT I thought you were supposed to be getting your act together. 
ALEXANDRA I have gotten my act together. I was just drinking. I've been doing really well, but nobody ever seems to notice my grades are better, and how I was in that stupid play you guys didn't bother to see. Do you even remember the name of it? 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 48   CONTINUED: (2)                                                      48 
It's on the tip of his tongue. 
ALEXANDRA (CONT'D) That's what I thought. So what if I got drunk on the ONE night you happened to drop in? So the fuck what? 
MATT Hey, hey, hey. Watch your language in front of Scottie. 
SCOTTIE I'm okay. 
MATT (sitting with them) Anyway, it's good to see you.      Welcome home. Want some eggs? 
ALEXANDRA How long do I have to stay? 
MATT We'll discuss that. 
ALEXANDRA (getting up) I'm going swimming. 
MATT Then I'll join you. 
ALEXANDRA Good times. 
49   EXT. KING SWIMMING POOL - DAY                                       49 
Matt walks out the patio doors. Seated on the steps of the shallow end, Alexandra is on her cellphone. 
ALEXANDRA (into phone) I gotta go. I'll see you later. (to Matt) The pool's really dirty. What day does the pool guy come? 
Matt notices all the floating leaves and insects. 
MATT He comes... you know, I don't know what day he comes. 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants             PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 49   CONTINUED:                                                               49 
ALEXANDRA Awesome. 
Matt grabs a POLE to skim the surface of the water. 
ALEXANDRA (CONT'D) Sid's coming over. 
MATT Who's Sid? 
ALEXANDRA A really good friend from Punahou.         We were in school together for years. 
ALEXANDRA I can't drop it. 
MATT You have to. 
ALEXANDRA You really don't have a clue, do you? Dad, she was cheating on you. 
Whoa. 
ALEXANDRA (CONT'D) That's what we fought about. When I was home at Christmas, I caught her with some guy. It made me sick to see her near you. I went back to school thinking that was it, I was done with her. I was going to call and tell you everything. But then the accident happened, and I was waiting until she woke up, I guess. And you, you didn't even suspect. Right? (off his silence) That disgusted me too. You're always so busy. 
MATT Caught her with some guy?    What does that mean? 
ALEXANDRA Brandy and I were on our way to swim in the Black Point pool, and suddenly I see Mom and some douchebag walk into a house. His house, I guess. 
MATT Just a guy? It could have been anybody. 
ALEXANDRA He had his hand on her ass.      It was gross. 
MATT You're sure it was her. (off her nod) Then what? 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 50   CONTINUED: (2)                                                       50 
ALEXANDRA Then nothing. She went into the house. A few days later I told her I knew what she was doing. 
MATT And? 
ALEXANDRA First she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. Like I'm blind. Then she got super-mad and started yelling at me and denied it. That's when I decided I didn't want anything more to do with her. 
MATT Who is he? 
ALEXANDRA I don't know. Some guy. 
MATT What did he look like? 
ALEXANDRA Dark hair. 
Matt stands up, walks in a little circle -- he literally does not know which way to turn. Then he knows. 
MATT Watch Scottie. 
51   EXT. KING HOUSE - DAY                                                51

MATT Hello!    It's me, Matt! 
MARK AND KAI appear at the top of the stairs looking as though they haven't been downstairs all day. 
KAI Oh, hey, Matt. 
MATT You guys weren't sleeping, were you? 
As they come downstairs -- 
KAI No, we were just fighting. Come on in. Want a drink? Want some coffee? 
MATT (shaking his head) What were you fighting about? 
MARK Stupid. 
KAI It's not stupid. He wants us to throw parties and have people over, which we do, of course, but who ends up doing all the work? Me. 
MARK It's work that's totally unnecessary. You don't have to do anything. Nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a new outfit and think of some goddamn theme cocktail. We can just invite people over last minute and drink whatever we have and hang out. It's more fun that way, anyway. 
As they continue their argument, Matt is struck by the pettiness of everyday life. He at once pities it, is impatient with it, and longs for it. 
MARK (CONT'D) You know what? We can talk about it later. Matt didn't come over to hear us squabble. 
ALEXANDRA Dad, this is Sid. 
MATT (sizing him up) Hello, Sid. 
Lanky and odd, a permanent smirk on his face, SID rises from his lounge chair.

SID `Sup, bro? 
As they shake hands, Sid pulls Matt into a man-hug and thumps him on the back. 
MATT Don't ever do that to me again. (to Alexandra) Get ready, okay? We're going to Grandma and Grandpa's. (to Scottie) Auntie Esther will come over to watch you. 
ALEXANDRA Sid's coming with us, okay? 
MATT Sid, this week, what's going on, is a real family matter. You understand. (to Alexandra) Sid's not going to be interested in meeting your grandparents. He'll be bored stiff. 
ALEXANDRA Dad, I told you he was going to be with me. I'll be a lot more civil with him around. 
SID (arms wide, shrugging) What can I say? 
58   EXT. KING HOUSE - DAY                                                  58 
Matt approaches the car with Alexandra and the interloper. 
MATT Does he know what we're doing? 
ALEXANDRA He knows everything. 
SID Dude, your wife is dying and then you find out she's been stepping out on you? That's harsh.

Matt watches retired military man SCOTT THORSON (70s) mumble as he sits at a table glancing over DOCUMENTS. 
Sid is splayed out on a nearby lounge chair. Alex seated at his feet. Every so often a PET PARROT squawks loudly. 
SCOTT THORSON This is like reading Korean. 
MATT Scott, I'll be happy to walk you through it. 
SCOTT THORSON (tossing the papers) Jibber-jabber. 
MATT It's an advanced directive -- basically her instructions on what medical procedures she wants or, in this case, does not want. No prolonged mechanical ventilation, no -- 
SCOTT THORSON I know goddamn well what it says. Says she doesn't want everyone waiting around while she spoils like milk. Says if the doctors can't do squat, she'd just as soon get on with it. 
He stares off into space. 
ALEXANDRA Gramps, are you okay? 
SCOTT THORSON Elizabeth had the good sense to write this thing here. Always a thoughtful girl. A strong girl. A hell of a lot stronger than her brother. Barry whines his way through life. Might even be a homosexual, for all I know. 
MATT Yeah, Scott, I don't think so. 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants         PINK Shooting Draft    4/11/10 Draft 59   CONTINUED:                                                            59 
SCOTT THORSON And she's stronger than you, Matt. She lived more in a year than you did in a decade, sitting in your office, hoarding all your cash. All that money you refuse to use -- what the hell good is it? And now you and your family are cashing in your chips -- what the hell for? Maybe if you'd let my baby have her own boat and bought her some safe equipment or let her go on those shopping sprees women like, maybe she wouldn't have gone in for those thrill sports. Maybe if you'd provided more thrills at home. 
ALEXANDRA Grandpa. 
SCOTT THORSON And you, Alexandra. Putting your poor mother through hell when all she was trying to do was instill some sense and drive in you. Shame on you. You should try to be more like her. She's a good girl. She's a good girl. 
The old man climbs to his feet and takes a few steps away. Hands on hips, he looks up as though gauging the weather. Then he clears his throat, wipes his face with his sleeve, turns back. 
SCOTT THORSON (CONT'D) You all want a drink? 
As he wanders away toward the kitchen -- 
LATER -- 
Scott returns pushing a little DRINK-CART. Behind him trails his wife ALICE. An Alzheimer's victim, Alice is a sweet woman, alert but unable to grasp or recall. 
ALICE Oh, do we have guests? 
MATT (kissing her) Hi, Alice. Good to see you.       It's me, Matt. 
ALEXANDRA You suck, Sid. 
SID Speaking of retarded, do you ever feel bad for wishing a retarded person or an old person would just hurry up? Sometimes I wait for them to cross the street, and I'm like, come on already! But then I feel bad. 
Rather than lashing out again at Sid, Matt turns around and lowers his head into one hand, squeezing his temples. It's all getting to be too much for him.

MATT (O.S.) Been doing any surfing over there on the Big Island? 
ALEXANDRA (O.S.) I haven't surfed in years. 
MATT (O.S.) Yeah, how come? You were so good. 
ALEXANDRA (O.S.) At first I stopped because I got my period and didn't know how to use a tampon. 
SID (O.S.) Didn't want to attract sharks, huh? 
ALEXANDRA (O.S.) So I wouldn't go for, you know, five days or so, and then I guess I just stopped. 
MATT (O.S.) Why didn't you ask Mom to show you or teach you or whatever?

ALEXANDRA (O.S.) I didn't even tell her I got my period for like a year. She was always pushing me to look older and act older, so I just... 
SID (O.S.) Even I know how to use a tampon. 
ALEXANDRA (O.S.) The first time I got my period I thought I shit my pants. 
SID (O.S.) Ew, maybe you did! 
ALEXANDRA (O.S.) Sid, shut up. 
MATT (O.S.) Are you sure he knows what's going on with our family? Because he sure doesn't act like it.

ALEXANDRA Do you know anything about him? Like what he does or if he's married? 
MATT Just his name.   Brian Speer. 
ALEXANDRA Why didn't you ask Kai and Mark? 
MATT I just didn't. 
ALEXANDRA Why not? 
MATT I didn't want to get into it. 
ALEXANDRA We'll google him later.    Okay, there it is. Stop.

ALEXANDRA Well, I can't say for sure he lives there. That's just where I saw them. 
Alex shoots him a look, then stamps out the butt on the bottom of her shoe. 
MATT (CONT'D) You could at least smoke lights.       Like Sid. 
ALEXANDRA I could. 
MATT Just got off the phone with Dr. Johnston. They did what they had to do a couple hours ago. They've moved her to another floor. They say she seems comfortable, still breathing on her own. She's doing okay.

MATT (CONT'D) So how are you doing, Alex? 
ALEXANDRA What do you mean? You mean considering Mom's... circling the drain? 
MATT No, I mean other than that. In general. You haven't been using, have you? 
ALEXANDRA No, Jesus, I'm not using. 
MATT Not at all? I smell pot all the time on Sid. 
ALEXANDRA That's Sid. 
MATT So you just stopped?   Really? 
ALEXANDRA Look, Dad, it's no big deal. Kids do drugs and they stop. Unless they're like super-ghetto. And you sent me to boarding school, remember? I couldn't get anything anymore. So no, I'm not doing any drugs. But I still think they're fun. Okay, maybe a little pot once in a while. 
MATT And a little drinking. 
She can't deny that. 
MATT (CONT'D) Why are you being so honest? 
ALEXANDRA Mom's dying. 
MATT Yeah, well, I'm proud of you.

ALEXANDRA Not much to be proud of. 
MATT Yeah, there is. We shipped you off. Let them handle it. And now you're here, helping with Scottie, helping me. Thanks. 
ALEXANDRA You want to know what really pisses me off? That she wouldn't end it. Not even when she knew she was busted. How are we supposed to feel about that? 
MATT I guess she really liked him. 
ALEXANDRA So how are we going to find this guy, Sherlock? 
MATT Right. Well, why don't you two take Scottie to the beach? I'm going to call around a little. We're on an island, for Christ's sake. Everything's just one degree of separation. 
ALEXANDRA (getting up) We'll find him.

Matt notices LUMPS OF SAND stuffed into Scottie's bikini top. 
MATT Hey, what's in your suit?

ALEXANDRA I don't know. Take them out, stupid. 
SID Yeah, Scottie. Honestly.       Big boobs look kind of fatty. 
Scowling, Scottie gets up and starts pulling the sand out of her suit as she stomps toward the water. 
ALEXANDRA Any luck? 
MATT The hotels were a dead end, but I took another shot with his office. He's definitely in Hanalei renting a house somewhere -- probably one of those cottages around the bay. Who wants to go for a walk? 
SID Sounds good. 
MATT Were you there?    Have you seen any of those movies? 
SCOTTIE No. 
ALEXANDRA You've got to watch her with     the internet. And Reina's dad.       Scottie, Reina is a fucked-up ho-bag,     and you need to stay away from her.      Do you want to end up like me? 
SCOTTIE Yes.

SCOTTIE No. 
ALEXANDRA Well, Reina's going to be a meth-head, and she's going to get used by stupid guys. She's a twat. Say it. 
SCOTTIE She's a twat. (running across the room) Twat, twat, twat, twat! 
MATT Stop that! (to Alexandra) I don't get it. I don't know what to do... these things she does. What goes on in her head? You weren't like that. 
ALEXANDRA It'll go away. 
MATT I'm not so sure. I mean, look how you kids talk in front of me. It's like you don't respect authority. 
Alex looks at him -- authority?

A sheepish look on his face, Matt takes a seat on the edge of the bed. 
MATT I don't, uh... I haven't been sleeping very much lately. 
SID Understandable. 
MATT I'm worried about my daughters. I'm worried there's something wrong with them. 
SID I used to do some messed-up shit when I was a kid. Still do. It's going to get worse after your wife dies. 
MATT What does Alex really think about this stuff that's going on? What does she say? 
SID She doesn't. 
MATT What do you mean? I thought she talks to you all the time. 
SID We don't really talk about our like "issues." We just, I don't know, we deal with our shit by talking about other stuff and having a good time. 
MATT What would you do if you were me? How would you handle my daughters? How would you handle... the situation of this guy we're trying to find? 
Matt can't believe what he just asked, but he's desperate for clues from even the unlikeliest source.

SID I told you what I'd do -- I'd lay his nuts on a dresser and hit `em with a spiked bat. With the daughters, I don't know. I'd take them on a trip. Or no, I'd buy `em a bunch of shit. Like with all the money you're going to get when you sell the land -- you're going to make stupid money, right? -- dude, you could buy them anything. 
Matt questions his sanity at having asked Sid any advice. 
MATT Do you want some of it?   Some money? 
SID Sure. 
MATT If I gave you a lot of money right now, tonight, would you leave? 
SID Why would I leave? 
Matt watches the little boys flop into the surf.        Mrs. Speer follows, wading in up to her calves. 
Matt stands to look whether Brian is coming down to the beach too. No such luck. 
MATT (CONT'D) (to Alex) I'll be right back. 
Matt gets to his feet, brushes off sand, and walks casually toward Mrs. Speer, maintaining a comfortable distance. Alexandra watches. 
IN THE SURF -- 
Matt takes up a casual stance near Mrs. Speer and pretends to look out at the water, just hanging out. Mrs. Speer continues to keep a watchful eye on her boisterous boys. 
MATT (CONT'D) Looks like you got yourself a handful with those two. 
JULIE Yeah. 
MATT Must keep you pretty busy. 
JULIE They're pretty non-stop, but they're at a really fun age. 
MATT How old are they? 
JULIE SPEER Eight and ten.

MATT Yeah, I'm just getting my girls out of town for a couple days. Their, uh, their mother is in the hospital, so I thought I'd give them a little break. 
JULIE Oh, no. 
MATT She'll be fine. 
JULIE What's wrong? If you don't mind my asking. 
MATT Just a little boating accident.       Hit her head a little too hard. 
Does Julie recognize any of this, or even recognize him? Doesn't seem like it. 
JULIE A sailboat? Or one with a motor? 
MATT (laughs, then --) One with a motor. 
She's actually sort of charming, this Julie Speer. 
JULIE Well, good luck with that. I wish her well. Skylar, don't go so far!

That hangs there a moment.      Matt suppresses the sudden desire to spill the beans. 
MATT No, can't say as I do. 
JULIE Oh, I just assumed, since he's been -- 
SCOTTIE Dad!     Dad, come here!   Something bit me! 
Matt looks over to see Scottie very agitated about something. 
MATT Excuse me.     Nice talking to you. 
JULIE You too.    Take care. 
COUSIN HUGH He's letting this brother-in-law in the cottage handle the transactions. A lot of them, anyway. Big score for that guy. 
It takes a moment for this stone to drop to the bottom of Matt's well. 
MATT What's he like? 
COUSIN HUGH Who?

MATT Brian Speer -- what else do you know about him? 
COUSIN HUGH Not much. He's lucky. The bugga's lucky. His sister is married to the guy. Son-of-a-bitch is going to make a shitload of money on commissions. 
MATT Not if we don't go with that bid. 
Cousin Hugh's eyes emerge momentarily from their drunken fog to give Matt a firm, steely warning. 
COUSIN HUGH We all want Don. You do too, Matt. You've said as much. 
MATT No, I know. You're right. Okay. Well. Good to see you, Hugh. 
COUSIN HUGH You too. 
MATT See you at the meeting. 
COUSIN HUGH I'll be there. 
TRACK TO THE TABLE firmly on MATT'S FACE as he processes this horrifying news delivered so casually. 
AT THE TABLE -- 
Matt takes a seat. Scottie and Sid eat fried appetizers. Alexandra just sits watching the musicians. 
SID This place rocks. 
SCOTTIE Totally. 
ALEXANDRA We ordered you mahi.

MATT (low) Great. 
The music grows more frenetic. 
Matt looks around the room, alienated from everything -- from the fried food and the tourists, from the umbrellas in the drinks, from his daughters enjoying the music and this cretin called Sid. 
Why can't a nuclear bomb blow the whole island up right now? 
108   EXT. THE ROAD BY THE BAY - SUNSET                                 108 
The light is swiftly fading, and our heroes are little more than SILHOUETTES as they walk back to the hotel. 
Sid and Scottie talk and laugh together.      Alex walks with her father. 
MATT So, guess what. Turns out Brian Speer is connected to Don Holitzer. 
ALEXANDRA Who's Don Holitzer? 
MATT The guy we're going to sell to. And that woman today at the beach. That was his wife. 
ALEXANDRA Whose wife? (then --) The hottie with the hat? You sure? (off his nod) So he's married. Nice. Why didn't you say anything? 
MATT It's him I want to talk to, not her.       I know where their cottage is. 
ALEXANDRA You do? So let's do it right now. Let's go knock on his door. 
MATT That's what I'm saying. 
Alexandra quietly exults. 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants          PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 108    CONTINUED:                                                          108 
MATT (CONT'D) Don't do that. Don't be excited.        This isn't fun. 
ALEXANDRA Well, it's what we came here to do. 
MATT So you to talk to his wife while I talk to him. And figure out some way to distract Scottie and their kids. 
ALEXANDRA Got it.    Sid, come here! 
ALEXANDRA Do you need help? 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 109   CONTINUED: (3)                                                  109 
JULIE (over her shoulder) No, no, I got it. 
Alex is glad to keep her ringside seat for the moment.       All buckle their mental seatbelts. 
MATT Elizabeth is dying. Oh, wait. Fuck you. And she's dying. We unhooked her from the machines this morning. She'll be dead in a few days. 
ALEXANDRA We're not here to hurt you. We just thought she'd want you to know. 
As they've plotted, Alex and Matt study Brian's paralyzed face. They exchange a glance, then look back at him. 
ALEXANDRA (CONT'D) This is him? Why would she go for him? 
MATT Beats me.    Well, he's very articulate. 
BRIAN SPEER I can't... I'm sorry. I never thought it would come to this. 
ALEXANDRA You're sorry my mom's going to die? You're sorry you fucked her? You're sorry you fucked over my dad? 
BRIAN SPEER I'm sorry for all of it. 
MATT Look, pal, like she said, I'm not here to wreck your life. I just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital. I don't know how long you're planning on being here, but I'm sure you can think of an excuse to leave. 
ALEXANDRA You must be good at that. 
MATT You can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want. Do you hear what I'm saying? 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants      PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 109   CONTINUED: (4)                                                 109 
Brian seems deeply lost in his own thoughts.     Then -- 
BRIAN SPEER Okay, look, I can't have you here.     You understand. 
Julie returns with wine for Matt and a soda for Alex. 
JULIE Here we go. (noticing) Everyone's so serious. Please don't tell me you're talking about business. 
ALEXANDRA We're talking about love. 
JULIE That's nice. Brian, call the boys in for dinner. 
BRIAN SPEER They're fine. Let them play a while longer. 
They all stand there a moment. Matt's unsure how to play this out. He shoots a quick panicked look at Alex, who scrambles to keep the ball rolling. 
ALEXANDRA Awesome cottage you're renting. 
MATT Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location. I used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental. Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian built it back in the 20s. Haven't been inside in years. 
JULIE Come on.   We'll give you a tour. 
ALEXANDRA Or, Brian, maybe you could give my dad a little walk down memory lane, and Julie and I can chat out here. 
MATT Yeah, I'd like that, if you don't mind. Just a quick look. 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft    4/11/10 Draft 109   CONTINUED: (5)                                                    109 
BRIAN SPEER Sure.    But it's not like I live here. 
Matt walks up to the door, making a point to let Brian open it for him. 
110   INT. HANALEI BAY COTTAGE - NIGHT                                  110 
Brian sweeps his hand around the room. 
BRIAN SPEER Here it is. 
MATT How did you meet?    I'm curious. 
For a moment Brian looks tricked, as if Matt really did just want a tour of the house. 
BRIAN SPEER I can't do this. 
MATT Neither can I.    How did you meet? 
BRIAN SPEER I thought you said you came here just to tell me. 
MATT I changed my mind. And I can't very well ask her the details. How'd you meet? 
SID Was he sorry? I hope he was sorry, man. You could have told his wife, and you didn't. I hope he knows how lucky he is. I would have told her everything. She deserves to know. Or else she's going to be a dumb bitch the rest of her life. 
ALEXANDRA Sid. 
SID I'm just saying. 
MATT No need to get creepy. Anyway, doesn't matter. That's all behind us. 
ALEXANDRA Yeah, the one we have to worry about telling things to now is Scottie. 
MATT I've asked Dr. Johnston to help us break the news tomorrow. 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 112   CONTINUED:                                                       112 
They turn to look at little Scottie, dead to the world in the window seat. 
113   INT. HOSPICE HALLWAY - DAY                                       113 
Matt and the kids walk slowly through this different, calmer wing of the hospital looking for the right room-number. 
Finally they find it and push open the door into -- 
114   INT. HOSPICE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                   114 
While still a hospital room, there is no medical equipment present. Bucolic colorful paintings on the wall are intended to be uplifting. But unlike the expansive view outside Elizabeth's ICU window, here the window looks out partially at a CINDER-BLOCK WALL. 
Sid and the Kings are greeted by DR. JOHNSTON and grief counselor DR. HERMAN, who affects a comforting smile. 
DR. JOHNSTON Hello, everyone. Matt. (off their greetings) This is Dr. Herman, whom I told you about. She works with us in counseling. 
DR. HERMAN (locking eyes with all) Hello, everyone. Hello. Hi.      Hello. 
The two professionals allow the Kings to turn their attention to Elizabeth, who now lies with no machines at all. Around her BALLOONS droop, FLOWERS wilt, get-well CARDS lie in a pile. Elizabeth too is wilting and drooping. Her skin is pasty, and her cheeks are hollow. 
SCOTTIE How come Mom isn't on any more machines? Is she getting better? 
The adults exchange glances.     Dr. Herman approaches Scottie. 
DR. HERMAN You must be Scottie. (off her nod --) Scottie, I have a present for you. 
Dr. Herman hands her a little squeaky RUBBER OCTOPUS she pulls from her pocket. 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants           PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 114   CONTINUED:                                                          114 
DR. HERMAN (CONT'D) That's right. It's an octopus. Such a funny creature with its eight legs. But did you know octopi are actually extremely intelligent, like dogs and cats? They have unique personalities, and just like us they have a lot of defense mechanisms. I'm sure you know about the ink sac. She uses ink to confuse her predators. She can camouflage herself. She can emit poison, and some can mimic more dangerous creatures, like the eel. I keep her to remind me of our defense mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage, our poison, all the things we use to keep away hurt. The reason Dr. Johnston invited me here today is to meet you, Scottie. I've heard a lot about you. 
SCOTTIE Like what? 
DR. HERMAN I've heard that you're a wonderful and unique and spirited girl. 
Dr. Herman shoots a look at Matt before continuing. 
DR. HERMAN (CONT'D) And I've heard your mom's not doing too well and that she's going to die very soon. 
All watch Scottie react to this news. 
SCOTTIE Dad, is that true? 
MATT Yes, Scottie. It's true. 
DR. HERMAN You're going to have to be a very brave girl right now, and you're surrounded by people who love you. I came to meet you and tell you that if you ever want to talk about what you're feeling, I would like to talk to you too. I can help you face what's going on without all the silly defense mechanisms that work for an octopus but not for us.

DR. JOHNSTON Okay.    Thank you, Dr. Herman. 
Dr. Herman looks at everyone with great sincerity before leaving. Scottie is left holding the octopus. She drops it, and it squeaks a little. 
ALEXANDRA What the fuck was that? 
DR. JOHNSTON Yes, well, they say she's very good one- on-one. 
SCOTTIE So Mom's going to die for sure? 
DR. JOHNSTON Yes. We worked really hard with her, but three other doctors and I agree she's in what we call an irreversible coma. Do you know what that means? 
SCOTTIE It means she doesn't have a brain anymore. 
DR. JOHNSTON Not exactly, but... yes, that's the general idea. So we're doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that ever happened. That's why she's not attached to the machines anymore. 
ALEXANDRA It's for the best, Scottie. Look at her. She's not happy like this. 
MATT She wasn't even driving! Her boat, someone else's boat -- it wouldn't have made any difference. You're not going to blame me for this. 
SCOTT THORSON Sure, sure, quibble about the details. She was a faithful, devoted wife. She deserved more. 
Why fight it? 
MATT You're right. She deserved more. 
SID For Christ's sake, take it easy on the man. 
Scott turns to Sid like he's about to pop him again. 
ALEXANDRA My father has been doing a really amazing job under the circumstances. 
His point made, Scott looks at Matt and the girls and shuffles to Elizabeth's bedside, puts his hands on Alice's shoulder.

ALICE Are we ready to go? 
BARRY THORSON No, Mom.    Not yet. 
MATT (gesturing toward the door) Girls, Sid. 
Matt, Sid and the girls quietly go into -- 
116   INT. HOSPICE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                  116 
-- where they take a few steps away. 
SID Man, that guy's a prick.       Was he always like that? 
MATT Yep. 
Scottie has stayed behind to peek through a crack in the door. Noticing, the others join her. 
THROUGH THE DOOR -- 
As Barry and Alice remain seated, their backs to us, Scott stands above his daughter, touching her arm, eyes closed. 
SID Is he praying? 
MATT No. 
SCOTT THORSON (opening his eyes) Say goodbye to Elizabeth, Alice. 
ALICE Oh.     Goodbye, Elizabeth. 
The old man puts his hand over his mouth and squeezes his eyes shut. Then he opens his eyes and places a hand on her forehead, smooths her hair back. 
WIDE -- 
Matt and his daughters watch without moving.

117   INT. KING HOUSE - MATT'S STUDY - NIGHT                             117 
Matt sits at his desk lost in thought. The only sound is the tick-tock of an old clock reading 3:20. Then he gets up and starts pacing, shooting occasional glances at the BLUEPRINTS and RENDERINGS atop his desk. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
118   EXT. HIGHWAY OUTSIDE KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY - DAY             118 
Matt turns off the highway and into a long driveway. 
119   INT. KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY HOUSE - DAY                       119 
Matt opens all front doors and lanai doors, letting air into the old place. He notices old PHOTOS OF KING ANCESTORS. 
120   EXT. KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY - DAY                             120 
Matt walks around the property alone, taking it in and thinking. Like everywhere in Hawai'i, the nature here is powerful -- TREES, BIRDS, SPIDERWEBS. 
121   EXT. KING FAMILY SHARED PROPERTY HOUSE - DAY                       121 
Matt plops heavily into a chair on the lanai. 
WIDER -- Matt alone. 
DISSOLVE TO -- 
He rises to help her find a spot to put the flowers.        She nods to the girls. 
JULIE I know we just met, but I was thinking about you guys these past few days, and I knew your mom was here. I don't know. I just felt I should stop by.

MATT You remember Alex. This is Scottie. Sid. This is Mrs. Speer. 
JULIE Julie. 
SCOTTIE Were you friends with my mom? 
JULIE No, we never met.   But I know a lot about her. 
As they now do often, Matt and Alex exchange a look. 
MATT Well, we appreciate your coming by. The flowers are lovely. 
SID (heading to the door) Scottie, Alex. Let's go to the cafeteria. 
The girls follow Sid's prompt, leaving Matt alone with Julie, standing, a dying woman between them. 
MATT I, uh, I'm not sure how much you know about my wife's condition, but she's going to die very soon. Any minute, really. That's sort of why we're all here. 
JULIE I know. That's why I came. Because I know. I came because my husband wouldn't. And that just didn't seem right. I thought someone from my family should come. 
Wow. 
MATT I'm sorry I came to your house like that. Just barged in on you. 
JULIE It's all right. I assume you're angry. Of course you are. I'm angry too. 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants     PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 123   CONTINUED: (2)                                                123 
MATT So he told you, huh? 
JULIE After you left that night, he was acting really weird. Then I started smelling it all over him. I'd already smelled it. 
MATT You're a woman. 
JULIE I finally got it out of him. We've been going crazy ever since. Not easy with the kids around. It's all something I never could have imagined. And then your family's decision about the land. I think you're doing the right thing, but Brian is -- well, it's all so complicated and confusing. 
MATT I know. 
JULIE Brian told me everything. Well, how can I ever know it's everything? When did you find out? Have you known for a while? 
MATT Just a few days ago. 
JULIE I'm angry, but I'm just so sorry.    I can't imagine what you're going through. Do you mind if I say something to her? 
Matt is unsure but what else can he do?   Julie approaches the bed. 
JULIE (CONT'D) Elizabeth, I'm Julie. Brian's wife. I just want to say I forgive you. I forgive you for trying to take Brian. I forgive you for almost destroying my family. I have to forgive you. Even though I want to hate you. 
(CONTINUED) The Descendants     PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 123   CONTINUED: (3)                                                 123 
MATT Okay. All right. That's enough, Julie. I think... I think that's enough. 
Matt walks to the door and opens it. Alex and Sid -- who've clearly had their ears against the door -- scamper away, unnoticed by Matt and Julie. 
MATT (CONT'D) He didn't love her. Just so you know. He didn't really love her. 
JULIE That's why I'm here. 
Julie heads to the door. At the door, she looks at Matt. Matt looks at her. She leaves. 
Matt is left alone with his wife, and he realizes suddenly that this is his moment. 
He walks to the bed, takes her hand, rubs his palm over her hair. He says something to her as though silently praying, then realizes he should say it aloud. 
He presses his lips to hers and puts his hand on her stomach. 
MATT Goodbye, Elizabeth. Goodbye, my love, my friend, my pain, my joy. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. 
124   INT. HOSPICE HALLWAY - DAY                                     124 
The door to Elizabeth's room opens, and Alexandra emerges, a far-away sadness on her face. She walks slowly toward -- 
A NEARBY WAITING AREA 
-- where Matt sits with Scottie and Sid. Matt and Sid rise to comfort her, but she's not in the mood. She allows them each to hug her briefly before turning to Scottie.

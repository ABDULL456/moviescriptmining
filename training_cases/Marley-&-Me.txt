In response to the crowd, they kiss. Standing right by them is SEBASTIAN -- tall, good looking, rugged type --John's best man.

SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) You got it. Leaf or something. 
JOHN 
(DUBIOUS) A leaf. On my forehead. 
SEBASTIAN Yeah, it musta had some sap on it. They pass a cluster of CO EDS who laugh at John. 
SEBASTIAN (O.S.) (CONT'D) And then there's Jenny. 
4 PHOTOS OF JENNY Looking, indeed, very cool, very put together. 
SEBASTIAN (O.S.) Studious, hard-working, quiet.

JOHN Um, okay, see now I don't wanna get out of the car. 
JENNY

ARNIE KLEIN -- fifties, never smiles, flowered shirts -- the editor of the Sun-Sentinel of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, is flipping through John's portfolio. 
JOHN Yes, sir, I got a Mitchy. (off Arnie's look) 
(MORE) 
14 CONTINUED: 
JOHN (CONT'D) Like a Pulitzer, but for western Michigan. 
ARNIE A Mitchy. Min-hmm. So, tell me, why did you want to leave the estimable - (he flips to a story, reads 
THE HEADING) - Kalamazoo Gazette? 
JOHN Well, as you know, Sebastian and I were in college together, and he was always talking about South Florida... mostly about the women of South Florida, but anyway, after my wife and I got married we thought it might be nice to come 
DOWN HERE-- 
JOHN You like the quote about the speed bumps? 
17 CONTINUED: 
JENNY 
(LOOKS) "If they save even one life--" 
JOHN -"it would be worth it. And with that, Janet Dickerson's mother's eyes filled with tears." 
(THEN) That one just felt exactly right, y'know? 
JENNY Yeah, no, it's good. What happened to the Desert Storm piece? 
JOHN That's it. The injured girl's dad's in Kuwait. What, that's not in there? 
JENNY (looks at the article) Uhhhh... they must've cut it... And they kinda misspelled your name. John Egan... 
JOHN What-- you're kidding-- He reaches for the paper, but she holds it away. 
JENNY Forget it. It's good, John. It's got facts, some color. It's a solid piece. 
JOHN Thanks. I'm almost done with yours. This idea of voting machines sounds 
REALLY EFFICIENT-- 
JENNY Well, except on the other page I talk about what could happen-- He goes back to reading. She sips her coffee. 
JOHN Oh, it continues... An awkward moment as he now searches for the new page, has to fold back the paper. No escaping the fact that ie article is longer and more important than his. She finally gets up... 
17 CONTINUED: (2) 
JENNY You know what? The rest is just okay, really pretty boring... 
JOHN No, no, I'm enjoying it... He tortures himself and keeps reading. She moves to the sink, starts to rinse out her cup... 
JOHN (CONT'D) Wow, they really gave you a lot of space, didn't they? She sets the cup on the counter, looks at the WILTED PLANT on the sill. 
JENNY Damn. I killed another one. How am I ever going to take care of a kid, I can't even keep a plant alive? John looks up from the paper. "Kid?" She comes gives him a kiss. 
JENNY (CONT'D) I'll see you later, Mr. Gorgan. She headsout, leaving John staring terrified at the plant. 
SEBASTIAN (V.0.) A kid, huh... 
18 EXT. SUN-SENTINEL OFFICE - DAY 
Sebastian and John fill up at the coffee pot, start to move through the office throughout... 
SEBASTIAN Well, what'd you expect? You bought a house, man. A house with a mare room... 
JOHN What's wrong with a spare room? 
SEBASTIAN It's empty, John. That's what's wrong with it. And you know what else is empty? Her womb. 
18 CONTINUED: 
JOHN I'm starting to worry that we're already at Step Six. 
SEBASTIAN What? 
JOHN You know Jenny, she's got her whole life organized and planned out... Sebastian smiles at a secretary, turns back to John. 
SEBASTIAN You want my advice? Get her a PuPPYâ¢ 
JOHN A puppy. 
SEBASTIAN Something other than you she has to take care of. (points at him) You have a kid, you're a dad. You're not you anymore. You have a dog, you're a master. You're still a guy. With a life. 
JOHN And a dog... 
SEBASTIAN Whatever, man. You're still free. You've stopped the clock. 
JOHN What clock? 
SEBASTIAN Okay... you know in movies when there's, like, a bomb and it's ticking down, ten seconds left, and there's some guy with a wire cutter going, "red wire... blue wire... which one do I cut?" And the guy finally just makes a wild-assed guess and SNIP. Silence. The world is saved. 
JOHN Okay... is the bomb strapped to a dog... because I'm not sure I'm 
FOLLOWING-- 
18 CONTINUED: (2) 18 
SEBASTIAN John, you buy this dog, you're saving your world. Because that ticking you hear, is not a bomb, it's her biological clock. John looks back at him. 
JOHN Huh. 
JENNY Of course he is. I can't wait to see him. 
JOHN Just him? 
JENNY Jealous? 
JOHN I'm not the one sleeping in a box. 
JENNY I love you. I'll see you Friday. 
30 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 30 
John, dressed to go out, is setting down Marley in his wooden box on the garage floor. 
JOHN I'll see you in the morning, okay? Marley looks at him with a heartbreaking expression. John hesitates. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Aw, come on, don't. You'll be fine, alright. And tomorrow, we're gonna tear it up. I'm thinking kibble, park, chew toy, the whole nine yards. Okay? we good? Marley doesn't-look so good, looks kind of sad. John turns and gets out of there. 
31 EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT 31 
John gets into his car. He can hear WHIMPERING. 
JOHN Big day tomorrow! Rest up, pal! He listens a beat; Marley quiets down. He gets in his car. 
32 INT. BAR - NIGHT 32 
Journalist hang out.'John and Sebastian at the bar. Many know Sebastian, he's constantly nodding at people throughout: 
SEBASTIAN So I'm there in this cave, right? Blindfolded. And I can feel the machine guns, there's like nine of 'em around me... and they tie me to a chair and then Escobar comes in and says-- are you ready? 
(SPANISH ACCENT) I read your piece on Kadahfi, And I think you captured his narcissism just right. 
(LAUGHS) Can you believe that? 
JOHN Some of it. 
SEBASTIAN Man, I wish you could've been there. 
JOHN Yeah, but then I wouldn't have been able to do the piece on the water main break at the library. That would have sucked. 
SEBASTIAN (hand on John's shoulder) Your time will come, amigo. 
JOHN I'll drink to that-- They toast with their beers, Sebastian clocks John looking at his watch. 
SEBASTIAN You gotta be somewhere? 
JOHN Oh. No, it's the puppy. It's his first 
NIGHT ALONE-- 
SEBASTIAN You got adoc? 
32 CONTINUED: 
JOHN Marley. A little lab. Like you said. Remember? The bomb... 
SEBASTIAN Oh, right. Smart move. You'll see. (slaps him on the back) You've just preserved your quiet way of life for at least another two years. 
33 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD -- NIGHT 
John pulls up, gets out of his car. Halfway down the block, we see a POLICE CAR, lights flashing, two OFFICERS talking to a COUPLE. Another NEIGHBOR, in his robe, stands in the street watching... 
NEIGHBOR Millers got robbed again. (then, turns to John) And that mutt of yours hasn't shut up since you left. John looks towards the garage where we hear WHIMPERING. 
34 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - GARAGE - NIGHT 34 
The door opens and the puppy gets excited-- 
JOHN No no... I just wanted you to know I'm back. The puppy whimpers and he goes over to him, reaches into the box and pets him... 
JOHN (CONT'D) Buddy, you really gotta chill, okay? Yeah, I know, good to see you, too. But I'm just inside the house, I'll see you in the morning. Big day tomorrow. Get some sleep. 
35 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - KITCHEN - NIGHT 35 
John gulps orange juice from the bottle. Leaves a quarter- inch, puts it back in the fridge. And now we hear BARKING from the Garage. 
36 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BATHROOM - NIGHT 36 
Water running. John swallows some preventative aspirin, picks some nachos off his shirt. He turns off the water. And we hear WAILING and KEENING coming from the garage. 
37 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - BEDROOM - NIGHT 37 
John has his head buried under the pillows AS THE WAILING AND KEENING GO ON. AND ON. AND ON. Finally, John can't take it anymore. He sits up, pulls earplugs out of his ears. 
38 INT. GARAGE - NIGHT 
JENNY (CONT'D) Does thunder scare you, Mister? Hm? He licks her face, snuggles into her. She gives him the Pluto stuffed animal. She hugs him... 
JENNY (CONT'D) Look at us. She looks up at John and smiles. He returns the smile. Mission accomplished. 
48 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 48 
As Marley bursts out of the back bedroom with one of Jenny's bras in his mouth. 
JENNY Marley, no! Jenny chases him into the kitchen, past John who holds up the newspaper... 
JOHN He gave me an extra paragraph... Marley bursts through the back screen door... 
49 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - BACKYARD - DAY 49 
A seemingly continuous shot, except that it's now A SIX MONTH OLD MARLEY who comes through the screen into the backyard now clutching a set of curtains in his mouth, still attached to the rod, and it's now JOHN who stumbles through the broken wire mesh to chase after him... 
JOHN Marley, no! John chases him across the backyard. Marley goes under the fence and John starts to go over into... 
50 EXT. THE NEIGHBOR'S BACKYARD - DAY 
And now it's a NINE MONTH OLD MARLEY who comes up from under the fence clutching a THANKSGIVING TURKEY in his mouth. And now it's Jenny AND John who go over the fence chasing him... 
JOHN Marley, no! They wave to the NEIGHBOR standing on his patio watching. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Hi, Tom-- Sorry... 
JENNY Happy Thanksgiving... Marley goes through a hedge and out onto... 
51 EXT. STREET - DAY 51 
Where Marley emerges into FRAME a FULL GROWN DOG, rapidly pulling Jenny by the leash along the intercoastal waterway. We track with him until a WOMAN WALKING A POODLE IS NOW IN FRAME and Marley gets the two women entangled as he starts humping the smaller dog... 
JENNY Marley, no! 
52 INT. SUN-SENTINEL - ARNIE'S OFFICE - DAY 
John sits across from Arnie. He looks thrown: 
JOHN I don't understand, why me? 
ARNIE I'm in a bind, John. 
JOHN But I'm a reporter, not a columnist. 
ARNIE It's a step up. 
JOHN Yeah, but it's a step away from what I wanna do. 
ARNIE It's also better pay, you set your own hours, pick your own topics... 
(MORE) 
52 CONTINUED: 
ARNIE (CONT'D) and it's only temporary, just until I find someone permanent. 
JOHN What happened to Jerry? 
ARNIE You may have noticed that in every other column, he went on about The Pie Palace? 
JOHN I really haven't read his-- 
ARNIE Turns out he's been getting free meals in exchange for mentioning the joint. It's also why he became such a fat ass. John nods. Oh. 
ARNIE (CONT'D) Anyway, it's twice a week. And like I said, it's only until I can find someone else to replace him. Then you're back on, uh... whatever beat you were on. 
53 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 53 
John pulls up, gets out of the car. His neighbors, The year-old GIRL -- short blue hair, pierced eyebrow -- and her MOM -- in a nurses uniform -- unload groceries from the car. 
GIRL Your dog's funny. 
JOHN 
(PAUSES) Uh, thanks. 
GIRL He tried to eat one of our tires. 
JOHN Yeah, well, dogs need rubber. Little known fact, helps the digestive tract... 
GIRL Right. Along with the occasional black Converse high top which I'd still love to get back by the way. 
53 CONTINUED: 
JOHN I'll do what I can. 
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D) Rein in that dog! All right, everyone, line up again. Demonstration. Mr. Grogan? Pay attention. She takes the leash from John and efficiently guides him into line with the other dogs. 
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D) It's a simple question of confidence in one's own authority. Shall I demonstrate a simple walk? 
JOHN Be my guest. 
MS. KORNBLUT Class? Even an unruly dog wants to obey his leader. Marley? Heel. And she steps off confidently - but Marley is a bit more confident than she is. He lunges, she pulls, he falls back on his hind legs, then barrels up and lurches forward. Ms. Kornblut half-stumbles, half rockets across the park. She manages to turn Marley around, and the whole process begins again as they make their way back to the line. Her face is flushed with embarrassment, anger, and exertion, but Marley, jowls frothing, is having a ball. It's like a walking tug-of-war. With difficulty, Ms. Kornblut manages to return Marley to John, but not before, as a coup-de-grace, he starts humping her leg enthusiastically. She struggles, he knocks her down, and then he buries his face in her crotch and humps her knee. John and Jenny rush over. John restrains Marley; Jenny helps up Mrs. Kornblut. She's livid. 
MS. KORNBLUT (CONT'D) That's it! He's out! 
JOHN He usually just does this with poodles. (looking at her bad perm) Maybe it's the hair. 
MS. KORNBLUT He's a bad influence on the others. Leg-humping is a virus. Once it takes hold in a group - he has to go! 
58 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - DAY 
As they follow Marley back into the house. 
JOHN Well, that was fun. (to the dog) Congratulations, Marley. You flunked obedience school. 
JENNY You know, John, there is something else we can do-- 
JOHN (looks at her) No, no, I'm not doing that to him. 
JENNY It's painless. And he'll be a lot more comfortable. It'll calm him down. 
JOHN Yeah, you know why he'll be calmer? Because he'll have nothing to look forward to. 
JENNY What're you talking about? There are plenty of other things that'll make him 
HAPPY-- 
JOHN That's where you're wrong. Trust me, Jen: I know. I'm a guy. And yeah, lots of things make us happy, but the only thing we really look forward to is sex. Runner up: the possibility of sex. 
JENNY Oh, Please. Every book says he'll live 
LONGER-- 
JOHN It'll just feel longer. 
JENNY John, he's out of control. It's the right thing to do. John sighs, looks at Marley who's now humping the stuffed "goofy" that Jenny gave him as a puppy. 
59 INT. JENNY'S CAR - DAY 
Jenny at the wheel. John in the passenger seat. Marley in the back, his front paws balanced on the center console. 
JOHN It won't be so bad, buddy. You'll see. Sex is overrated. Marley looks-at him. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Okay, I'm lying, and I think you know that... so maybe the best thing is to just not talk about it. Jenny cuts him a look. He lowers his voice. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Poor son-of-a-bitch. A guilty John cracks the window just a bit and Marley begins listing to starboard, leaning against John to catch a whiff of the outdoor smells. Marley crawls onto John's lap... 
JOHN (CONT'D) Oh, okay, you wanna sit up here... Marley now jams his nose into the small opening, snorting to catch the fresh air 
JOHN (CONT'D) Least I can do. John lowers the window and Marley gets his whole snout out. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Here you go... John lowers the window again and now Marley sticks his whole head out, ears flapping behind him, tongue hanging out like he's drunk. 
JOHN (CONT'D) He's so happy. He has no idea what's about to happen to him. Jenny looks over as Marley hooks his paws over the half open window so that his neck and upper shoulders now hang out of the car. 
JENNY He's making me nervous. 
59 CONTINUED: 
JOHN He's fine. He just wants a little 
FRESH-- Suddenly Marley slides his front legs out the window until his front armpits are resting on the glass. 
JENNY John, grab him! Before John can do anything, Marley is off his lap and scrambling out the window of the moving car. 
JOHN He's onto our evil plan, and he's making a break for it! But now his butt is up in the air, his hind legs clawing for a foothold... 
60 EXT. INTERCOASTAL WATERWAY BRIDGE - SAME 
As Jenny slows down in heavy traffic, John lunges out the window after Marley, grabs the end of his tail with one hand so that Marley dangles upside down, outside the car, by his tail... He trots along the pavement with his front paws... 
61 INT. CAR - SANE 
Jenny gets the car stopped, HORNS HONKING BEHIND THEM. 
JOHN Uh, little help here... John's stuck. He can't pull the dog back in the window and he can't open the door. He can't let go as angry drivers behind them are now starting to swerve around them. John hangs on for dear life... 
JENNY I got him! 
62 EXT. BRIDGE - SAME 
JOHN I can probably live with a few leaks. 
JENNY Really? Because a leak can turn into something bigger... and that can be a big responsibility. 
JOHN I know. 
JENNY I was just thinking that we might want everything fixed before we went to the next step. 
JOHN Well, we've already fixed Marley. Literally. 
(CONTINU ED) 
Marley & He Shooting Draft 65 
65 CONTINUED: (2) 
JENNY You're serious about this? 
JOHN I think so. JENNY t an And you know we're not talking abou actual roof here. 
JOHN Yeah, I got that. She looks back at him, finally nods. They are. Then.. 
JENNY Okay. Maybe, instead of tying to have a baby, we should stop trying to not have one. 
JOHN If I'm following you correctly -- and I think I am -- this is the part where we go home and get it on, right? 
JENNY Bingo. 
66 INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
him. As Jenny pushes John back onto the bed, starts kissing Things getting hot and heavy quickly. As they kiss... 
JENNY Honey? 
JOHN Yeah... 
JENNY Did you eat some kibble? 
JOHN What? And now they part and we see MARLEY'S HUGE FACE RESTING ON THE SIDE OF THE BED, watching, panting up a storm. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Marley-- get out of here! 
SHOOTING DRAFT 
MARLEY & ME 66 
66 CONTINUED: 
JENNY 
KNOW it's fine, he's a dog, he doesn't what he's looking at. 
JOHN 
RESENTS Oh, he knows, and trust me, he the hell out of me right now. Go on, Marley! Get out! But Marley jumps up on the bed, tries to climb on both of 
THEM-- 
JENNY Marley! And now they both start laughing as the dog tries to lick their faces... 
67 INT. ARNIE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Silence. Arnie reads John's column, his face dead serious. 
ARNIE This is even funnier than the last one. 
JOHN Thank you, sir. 
ARNIE You're good, Gorgan. And not just the dog stuff. The piece on the women of Boca last week. What'd you call them? 
JOHN Boccahontis. 
ARNIE Hilarious. John nods, starts for the door... 
ARNIE (CONT'D) Is it true what you wrote? You and the wife are trying to have a kid? 
JOHN Well, we're not really trying. 
ARNIE How's that work? 
JOHN Excuse me? 
SHOOTING DRAFT 
MARLEY & ME 67 
JOHN (to the dog) So. This is us not trying. The bathroom door opens and Jenny walks out in a tiny, silky two-piece thing... 
JENNY Hey, Sailor. She walks into the bedroom. John looks back at Marley as he follows her into the bedroom. 
JOHN Catch you later, buddy. And closes the door on the dog. 
73 INT. BAR - NIGHT 73 
John and Sebastian sit at the bar. 
73 CONTINUED: 73 
SEBASTIAN So the puppy wasn't enough? 
JOHN Well, technically, we're not trying. But you know Jenny. 
SEBASTIAN But things are good right now, just as they are, right? 
JOHN Yeah, things are really good. 
SEBASTIAN So why change it up with a kid? I mean, have you already forgotten my little cautionary tale... 
JOHN The bomb, right? 
SEBASTIAN Yes. The bomb. And just so we're clear, the countdown sequence has been reactivated. By you. 
JOHN Well, it's been a few months and nothing's happened. Which actually makes me wonder if-- 
BARTENDER Mr. Grogan? The BARTENDER sets a PHONE down in front of John. 
BARTENDER (CONT'D) Phone call. I loved that thing you did on your dog watching you and your wife have sex? Really funny stuff... 
JOHN 
(EMBARRASSED) Thanks... 
BARTENDER Seriously, man, your stuff is classic. 
JOHN Well, it's just temporary, but thanks. John cuts a look at Sebastian, picks up the phone. 
73 CONTINUED: (2) 73 
JOHN (CONT'D) Hello. 
JENNY (PHONE) I just wanted to let you know that there's a naked blonde in your bed. 
JOHN Oh. Why don't you two get started and I'll be there as soon as I can. 
JENNY Very funny. Can you come home? I'll make it worth your while. 
JOHN Oh. Alright then. I'll see what I can do. He hangs up. Looks at Sebastian. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Uh, I'm sorry, man, but I gotta jam. I forgot, I had this thing, I gotta deal 
WITH-- 
SEBASTIAN She's calling you home, isn't she? 
JOHN Yeah. See you later. John starts out of the bar. Sebastian calls after him. 
SEBASTIAN Tick tick tick! 
74 INT. 345 CHURCHILL - NIGHT 
Romantic Music on the stereo. John comes in, wearily, absently pets Marley. He goes into the bedroom. The bathroom door is open. John sits down on the bed. 
JOHN You know, this baby thing. I been thinking maybe we should take a break. You know? Obviously, it's not happening. Maybe that's nature's way of saying it's not good timing. No sound from Jenny. He struggles on. 
74 CONTINUED: 
JOHN (CONT'D) Maybe this is a sign that we're not ready for this. I mean, have we really thought this through? Because-- 
BEHIND He looks up to see Jenny at the bathroom door. From her back she brings out a home pregnancy test strip. 
JENNY I'm pregnant. 
JOHN (PAUSE, then) Great. Wow, that's... great. 
JENNY But you just said 
JOHN Yeah, no, I mean-- okay, this is definitely awkward now, but... 
JENNY You wanna start over? 
JOHN Can I? 
JOHN He made me! Go! Jenny lurches for Marley, going for his collar, and John leaps at him from behind. Marley skitters away. Ah, a game! He wags his tail, prances, sticks his rear in the air and his puts his head to the ground. John feints, tries to maneuver Marley back into Jenny. Jenny finally grabs him from behind. John pries open his mouth. Nothing. He reaches inside, looks up at Jenny. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Uh-oh. 
77 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - BACKYARD - MORNING 
John grimaces in the morning sun as he watches Marley poop. He takes a hose and squirts at the deposit until it runs into the lawn. Nothing. 
JENNY (O.S.) Dr. Jay's sending over a laxative. 
JOHN Yay. 
78 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - BACKYARD - DAY 
John hoses through Marley's huge orange iridescent poops. 
JOHN Man, you gotta lay off the mangoes. 
(A SIGH) You know, years ago, when I pictured my life, somehow standing in my backyard hosing down dog crap in search of my bride's swallowed and recycled ass- kissing gift just didn't spring to mind. 
(SUDDENLY EXCITED) Aha! Jackpot! 
79 INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Carefully, Jenny lifts the shiny necklace out of a glass filled with bleach. 
JENNY I think it's shinier than before. Amazing. 
JOHN Yeah. He did us a favor. And I only threw up eight times. 
JENNY My hero. 
80 INT. OB/GYN OFFICE - EXAMINING ROOM - DAY 
The NURSE arranges the gown on Jenny. 
NURSE How's that crazy dog of yours? (smiles at John) I'm a big fan. 
JOHN Thank you. 
NURSE The heartbeat'll be very fast, like a little train. That's normal. 
Shooting Draft  56. 
MARLEY & ME 
80 CONTINUED: 
JOHN Is it too soon to tell the sex? Not that I care. He can be any sex he wants. Male, female, we don't care. Unambiguous genitalia, if we had our druthers, but whatever... 
NURSE Shhhhh... hang on... She listens for a moment with a little microphone hooked up to a speaker. Nothing. 
NURSE (CONT'D) Sometimes you,can't hear it, depending on how the baby is lying.- You're ten weeks, right? 
JENNY Next Monday, yes. 
NURSE Might be a little early for that. Let's go right to the sonogram. Did you bring your blank tape? 
JOHN (waving it, smiling) Ready to roll. 
NURSE Let's get a good picture first. It'll be on the monitor there. The Nurse begins running the instrument around Jenny's stomach. John and Jenny peer at the computer screen. 
NURSE (CONT'D) 
(NEUTRAL) Hmmm. This one doesn't seem to be picking up anything. Excuse me, I'll be just a minute... She leaves. Jenny and John smile at each other, but inside each of them, a small pinpoint of fear starts to expand. We wait for a few moments. A pressured silence. And then... smiles down at DR. SHERMAN comes in, followed by the nurse, Jenny. 
DR. SHERMAN Hi, guys. Let's have a look at your baby, shall we?

DR. SHERMAN (CONT'D) (he takes the instrument) All right, there we go. Good. Now, look over there. Much better resolution, right? Jenny and John, holding hands, look at the computer screen. They see a sac, which, with a click of the mouse, Dr. Sherman expands and expands. But it's empty. Jenny tries to smile. 
JENNY Is there anything in there? 
DR. SHERMAN Not what you'd expect to see at ten weeks. 
JENNY Not quite ten weeks. Dr. Sherman looks at them directly. Kindly: 
DR. SHERMAN Jenny, I'm sorry, but there's no heartbeat. John and Jenny are still, silent.

JOHN It's okay. 
JENNY Ow! Suddenly, A GROWL. They turn to see Marley glaring at John. 
JOHN It's okay. I'm not hurting her. Jenny MOANS again and now Marley's eyes narrow. He takes a step towards John. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Please don't scream, honey. He'll kill me. 
JENNY You put the car seat in this weekend, right? They won't let us take the baby home without the car seat installed. 
JOHN Like I'd forget that. 
105 INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 105

JOHN (CONT'D) No, don't lick it, eat it! Destroy it! You can chew through drywall, man! I know you can do this! Marley catches on. He starts shredding the box.

JENNY Hello, Marley... She crouches down, gives him a kiss, rubs his back. And that's when we hear a small, birdlike chirp and the dog freezes. Where'd that come from? We hear the coo again and this time Marley lifts one paw in the air like a bird dog, and points in the direction of the car seat that we now see sitting on the bed... 
GIRL At work... 
JOHN Jenny'll call her... 
125 CONTINUED: Marley sniffs at the ground, growling more and more intensely. We hear SHOUTING, "He went that way" as several neighbors take off running. Marley lifts his head and he, too, bolts into the night--- 
JOHN (CONT'D) Marley! NO! But he's gone and John has to stay with the girl. We hear SIRENS as she slides down the car and sits down on the ground. John sits down beside her, holding onto her... 
JOHN (CONT'D) All this time we've been living here, I never got your name. 
GIRL Lisa. 
JOHN Well, you're gonna be alright, Lisa, the police are on the way... John looks off, wondering where Marley is... 
126 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - LATER 126 
A crime scene. Jenny, clutching the baby, stands on the porch watching as an AMBULANCE pulls away. John, now in shorts and a T-shirt, comes jogging up the walk. 
JOHN I can't find him anywhere. 
JENNY Maybe we should get in the car, drive around. 
JOHN I'll get the keys... John's coming into the house when a police cruiser pulls to the curb in front of the house. A POLICEMAN gets out of the driver's side, then opens the back and leads Marley out. He bounds up the walk to the two of them who greet him... 
JENNY Marley! 
JOHN Where were you? 
126 CONTINUED: 126 
OFFICER We found him outside the 76 station on Radford. He had the guy cornered in the men's room. 
JENNY So you caught the guy? 
OFFICER 
NO-- 
(INDICATES MARLEY) jig caught the guy. He also gnawed the barrel of my shotgun, and ate half my radio mic. They look at Marley wagging his tail, panting. 
OFFICER (CONT'D) Anyway, the neighbors all said he belonged here, but none of them wanted to drive him, so... 
JOHN Thanks for bringing him home.

JOHN (CONT'D) Marley! 
128 INT. BOCA RATON HOUSE - DAY 128 
A REALTOR is showing a COUPLE around the large, empty, new house. She points out the designer kitchen that looks out onto the patio and pool, a huge yellow lab now leaping in. A moment later, we see John, clutching Patrick, enter the backyard, try to haul Marley out of the pool. He gives up, heads for the house, opens the back door and peers inside. 
JOHN Hi. The Realtor smiles awkwardly at him. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Can I see a set-up, please? 
REALTOR Certainly. (looks at the baby) First home? 
JOHN No, we live up in West Palm, over on Churchill? 
REALTOR Ooooh. Well, I think you'd find this neighborhood to be quite a pleasant change. And now Marley bolts past him into the house, tracking wet footprints all over the floor, jumps up onto the REALTOR.

JOHN Yeah. 
LISA well, I don't blame you. I just thought I'd come over and say-- But Marley comes running over and she crouches down to greet him. She hugs him a while... 
LISA (CONT'D) I'm gonna miss you. John watches as she holds on to him a bit longer, thanking him as well. John turns away, starts back for the van to give her a moment. She stands up. 
LISA (CONT'D) Where you moving to? 
JOHN Boca. 
LISA Huh. 
JOHN Huh... what? 
LISA Nothing. I just... never pictured, you know, a guy like you moving to Boca.

LISA Actually, a paramedic named Josh saved my life. 
JOHN Right. Well, take care, Lisa. Oh, 
WAIT-- He reaches into a moving box, pulls out a chewed-up black Converse. 
JOHN (CONT'D) I believe this belongs to you.

Marley lifts his head, perks up his ears and listens. Please don't bark, dog. Please don't bark. BEEP BEEP- And Marley BARKS, bolts out of the room...

BEHIND THEM A blonde Boca Trophy wife, with a poodle on a jeweled leash, shrieks excitedly as she meets up with another woman, same type, with another small fluffy'dog. The little dogs yip. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to underneath the table to Marley who has spotted the poodles and is now locked and loaded. 
ON JOHN AND JENNY As suddenly their table suddenly leaps away from them and starts moving down the sidewalk, crashing into other tables, banging-into waiters with trays, making a terrible NOISE as it scrapes over the faux Italian paving stones. The four Grogans sit facing each other across, their drinks suddenly in their laps. Marley is pulling the table, like a dog with a sled, towards the now-terrified small dogs. He is chugging forward with every ounce of rippling muscle he has. 
JENNY (CONT'D) Marley! John hurries after the dog; Jenny stays with the boys. 
Marley & He Shooting Draft  94.

There's a florist kiosk in the center of the plaza; Marley- and-table take out most of the merchandise. Security guards look around wildly. It's pandemonium, but Marley is in heaven. He makes a circuit of the entire plaz a, one poor poodle runs for her life. Finally, back where Marley started, the terrified toy poodle leaps into Jenny's arms. Marley tries to brake - 
JOHN Marley, no! - and suddenly, he is jerked back. John has tackled the table Marley's dragging. Marley YELPS and lands on his bac k, then quickly rights himself, tail wagging, the happiest dog in the world. Everyone surrounding them on the plaza has frozen silent. They all stare at Marley and the Grogans. The poodle jumps out of her arms and runs to its distraught owner. Jenny's head is in her hands, her shoulders heaving... 
JOHN (CONT'D) Jen, you okay? 
(NO ANSWER) Jenny? And she slowly looks up, LAUGHING UNCONTROLLABLY, her whole body racking, tears in her eyes. Her LAUGHTER BECOMES-- --A BABY CRYING and we now go to...

ON THE TOBOGGAN Flying down the hill. Marley is much heavier than the kids, and they sail past the place where the kids stopped, through the woods, barely missing trees and low-hanging branches, 
TOWARDS: 
JENNY John! The creek! The toboggan bumps over the crest of a small hill and sails through the air, landing with a crash on the iced-over creek. John and Marley tumble into a snow bank on the opposite side. A moment. But then Marley jumps up and wriggles in delight. John painfully unfolds himself, checks for injuries. Marley comes up and romps with him. 
JOHN Hey... wanna do it again? 
JENNY John! 
182 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - NIGHT 182 
John shuts off all of the lights, heads upstairs. We follow him up the stairs. He stops near the top, peers through the bannister into... 
183 PATRICK'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 183 From the low angle of the stairs, Patrick lies on his side, sleeping. And then we see Marley's head rise and reveal itself as Marley lifts it to look at John standing there. He'd been laying there on the bed behind Patrick. He looks at John, knows he's not supposed to be there, but... 
JOHN That's alright, pal. I won't tell. 
(THEN) We kicked ass down that hill, didn't we? John smiles at him and continues up to bed. 
184 EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - AFTERNOON 184 
Early Spring. The snow has melted. Marley, still as a statue, sits at the side of the road, waiting. Suddenly, he stands up and starts to wag his tail.

PATRICK Hey, boy. We HOLD WIDE ON THEIR BACKS as the boys start up the road towards home, Marley bounding between them, nipping at Patrick's backpack. 
185 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DUSK 
John pulls up as the boys now throw a football back and forth while Marley leaps into the air, trying to intercept it. John gets out of the car, claps his hands, holds them up... 
JOHN Hit me, I'm open! Patrick throws the ball to John who catches it, mocks stiff- arms his way to the front steps with the boys now hanging off him as he gives the play-by-play... 
JOHN (CONT'D) My God, look at Grogan-- two three- hundred pound linemen literally hanging off him, but he won't be denied! And now Marley jumps on them. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Ohhh, out of nowhere, a brutal hit from the Strong Safety and the unthinkable happens... GROGAN GOES DOWN... And he collapses with the boys at the foot of the. steps, Marley all over them, licking whatever faces he can get. Colleen comes out the front door, stands at the top of the steps... 
COLLEEN Mommy says dinner and take off your shoes. 
JOHN Alright... c'mon guys... They all get up, start up the steps. Marley follows, takes one step when his hind legs buckle. John looks back at him. 
185 CONTINUED: 
JOHN (CONT'D) You okay, boy? C'mon... Marley tries the second step and again his legs give out. He looks up at them... 
CONOR What's wrong with him, Daddy? 
PATRICK 
(QUICKLY) Nothing's wrong. He's just tired. Right, Dad? John sees the way Patrick is looking at him, knows he's protecting his little brother. 
JOHN That's right. Football just took it out of him. C'mon, let's give him a hand. And now the three of them go to Marley, help him up the stairs. 
186 INT. PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER - EDITOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
John sits across from the editor.

STORY-- 
JOHN I'm pretty sure I don't mention myself--

DR. PLATT Mr. Grogan-- 
JOHN I'll tell you what it's based on: regular dogs. (getting worked up) Lady, we are so far from 'regular", you have no idea. 
(INDICATES MARLEY) My guy here... He once ate an entire answering machine, and digested it. Then went back and ate the phone for dessert. So don't give me numbers like "one percent," because you don't know him. But I do, and I'll see him in the morning. We TRACK WITH JOHN as he storms out of the exam room, walks down the hall, goes through waiting room, then he PASSES US as he goes out into the dark parking lot, walks to his car and stops. We stay BEHIND HIM as he leans with one hand on his car, and doesn't move. 
198 INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Jenny's sitting at the table looking through a thick album when John comes in. She looks up at him expectantly. 
JOHN We're just gonna have to wait and see. If he makes it through the night, I think we'll be alright. He notices the album. 
JOHN (CONT'D) What're you looking at? 
JENNY Your old columns. He's in a lot of 'em. 
198 CONTINUED: John rotates the album for a better look. 
JOHN You saved these? 
JENNY Every one. He looks up at her. 
JENNY (CONT'D) Even on the crappiest day, when the boys were driving me nuts and the laundry wasn't done and a hundred other things were hard, I knew I had this. (taps the book) Five minutes of you. Sometimes they were funny and sometimes they were sad, or silly or whatever, but they were all you. And for those five minutes, you made me feel better. She gets up, comes over to him, leans down and kisses his head. Then, as she starts out... 
JENNY (CONT'D) You should read them. They're pretty great. 
199 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAWN

Loft. Downtown. Full of unpacked boxes. A mattress on the floor. Expensive electronics sit atop their cartons. John follows Sebastian on a "tour." 
JOHN Nice place. How long you been here? 
SEBASTIAN Two years, little more. Sebastian sees John looking at all of the unpacked boxes. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I'm in and out of town so much I really haven't had a chance to settle in. I hired a decorator, but she and I got into a thing and it got messy-- 
JOHN Right. 
SEBASTIAN Beer? 
JOHN I can't, I still got one more interview to do. 
A Sebastian opens the fridge revealing nothing but beer and hunk of Parmesan. 
SEBASTIAN What's the piece again? 
JOHN 
U.N. 
SEBASTIAN Right, you told me that. So you're down in Philly now, huh? 
JOHN Just outside. More space for the kids. 
A John and Jenny find Marley lying peacefully in front of the dying fire. 
JOHN I guess I could move his bed down here. John sits down beside Marley. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Man. He's always slept with us. Now he can't even make it upstairs. 
JENNY He looks pretty comfortable to me. 
(THEN) I'll go get his bed. 
JOHN Hey Jen? why don't you grab a blanket for me, too. She nods, starts back up the stairs. John grabs a pillow from the couch and lays down beside Marley. 
JOHN (CONT'D) This is a good spot. I may never sleep upstairs again. 
JENNY (O.S.) Hey. Scooch over. He looks up and see that Jenny's brought a blanket. She lies down with them. John puts his arm around them both. Marley's tail begins gently pounding the floor. 
207 CONTINUED: 
JENNY (CONT'D) Just like old times. 
THUMP. THUMP. 
208 INT. PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER - DAY 
John sits across from his editor. 
JOHN It'd be twice a week. Six hundred words. 
EDITOR And what's the subject? 
JOHN Everyday stuff. The stuff we all go through. But funnier. 
EDITOR I don't get it. I thought you came here to be a reporter. 
JOHN I did, but I think we both know that isn't me. I'm a columnist. A good one. A SECRETARY sticks her head in the office... 
SECRETARY John-- your wife's on the phone. She says it's important... 
JOHN I'll be right there. (to the editor) Think about it. 
209 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY 
Jenny on the phone, looking out into the backyard. 
JENNY I can't get him back inside. He's lying out there in cold... and he won't move... 
210 EXT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DAY 
Late afternoon. John's car pulls up. 
211 INT. PENNSYLVANIA HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 211 
Jenny and Patrick are sitting on the floor. Marley is lying on the dining room floor, breathing heavily. 
JENNY Patrick came home and we got him here. Dr. Platt said if he's comfortable, leave him here for a while and see. But he's no better. John kneels down by Marley, who looks at him but doesn't wag his tail or lick his hand. He runs his hand over his coat - then over his stomach, the dog flinches. 
JOHN I'm taking him in. The kids all come into the room, Colleen carrying a stuffed sheep. 
COLLEEN Is he sick again? 
JOHN Yeah, he is, honey. But I'm going to take him to the hospital and they'll try to make him better. Conor bends down, nuzzles Marley's face. 
CONOR Get better, Mar. 
COLLEEN You can take Lamby, okay? (she puts the stuffed animal next to him) But don't chew her other ear off. Patrick leans down, hugs Marley tightly and whispers right in 
HIS EAR: 
PATRICK Goodbye. When he looks up at his father, John can see that Patrick's crying, that he knows what the other two don't. 
212 EXT. VET'S - NIGHT 212 
John lifts Marley out of the car. Marley seems a little more alert. 
212 CONTINUED: 
JOHN You wanna walk? He sets him down gingerly. Hesitantly, Marley walks over to the tree that countless dogs have peed on, sniffs it, then looks around. John looks around, too. It's a crisp spring night in Pennsylvania. Takes a breath... 
JOHN (CONT'D) Nice night, huh? Marley looks around, then looks at John. There's something in his expression. John nods, knows what he's saying. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Okay, boy. (as Marley moves close) Okay. John, his heart breaking, bends down to carry Marley up the front steps of the clinic. 
213 INT. VET WAITING ROOM - LATER 
John stands as Dr. Platt comes out...

1    EXT. ACADEMY FIELD - DOMINICAN REPUBLIC - DAY 
A high angle looking out over a well-manicured baseball field carved out of a tropical jungle. A game is currently in progress. 
A1   ON THE FIELD 
Wearing KANSAS CITY KNIGHTS uniforms, mostly Black and dark- skinned Dominicans as well as several lighter-skinned Venezuelans (17-22 years old) are set in their positions, poised for the next pitch. 
CLOSE ON the pitcher, MIGUEL SANTOS (aka AZÚCAR/SUGAR - 19, lean, Black and handsome). Sweat drips down his face in the oppressive midday heat. He steadies his glove and ball at his chest, peeking over at the RUNNER on first base. Miguel lifts his leg high into the air, rears back his right arm, and FIRES the ball toward the plate. 
THUD! A cloud of dust pops off the CATCHER'S mitt as the ball slams inside. 
UMPIRE Strike three! 
The BATTER lowers his head, helpless in the face of Miguel's overpowering fastball. 
FROM THE DUGOUT, Miguel's TEAMMATES CHEER him on. HEAD COACH REYES (dark-skinned, 30s) nods approvingly, CLAPS. 
BEHIND THE HOMEPLATE BACKSTOP, a dozen rookie players also in Kansas City uniforms cheer for their team. Two YOUNG PLAYERS clocking Miguel's pitches look at each others' radar guns, which read 92 and 93 MPH. 
As the next batter steps up to the plate, Miguel's catcher, JOSE (18), taps his index finger on his thigh, calling for an outside fastball. 
The next pitch is popped up on the infield between first and home. Miguel locates the ball, points to the sky, but Jose and first baseman, PEDRO BERROA, nearly collide, as the ball lands between them and the runners reach base safely. 
B1   FROM THE OBSERVATION TOWER, the ACADEMY'S DIRECTOR, LEANDRO                 B1 ALVAREZ (light-skinned, late 50s) and several other COACHES and SCOUTS jot down notes on their clipboards. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   2. 
C1   ON THE FIELD, Miguel glares at Pedro, who averts his eyes, and     C1 kicks the dirt. 
Miguel looks in for the sign from Jose, nods, and delivers a tight fastball that sends the batter stumbling backwards to the dirt. 
Some players LAUGH and heckle the batter. Others point angry fingers at Miguel, who greets the batter back to the plate with a friendly, but authoritative, grin. 
He sends in the next pitch and the batter swings right through it, getting nothing but air. 
2    INT. ACADEMY DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                   2 
The TEAM (about 35 young men) gather around several tables for their standard baked chicken and rice lunch. The mood is friendly and playful as players tease each other across the tables. Miguel, sitting with his friends MARCOS (2nd base) and ALFONSO (3rd Base), works on a second helping of dessert. 
MARCOS Check out Sugar... Puts on twenty pounds in two months; now he's going for twenty more. 
MIGUEL (mouth full of food) All muscle, baby. Rock solid. 
For some NEW PLAYERS, distinguishable in the sea of BLUE uniforms by their BLACK "tryout" jerseys and ragged sneakers, it is their first healthy meal, and they eat as if it were their last.   One of them, SALVADOR (Black, scrawny, 17) holds his plate up to his mouth, shovelling food down his throat. 
PEDRO Slow down, kid, it ain't going nowhere. 
A few of the guys LAUGH. 
MIGUEL (to Pedro) If you hustled half as much as him, maybe you'd be hungry too. 
The other guys "ohhhh" Miguel's insult, as Salvador and Miguel exchange subtle grins.

3   INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - SAME DAY                                  3 
Kids crowd around in a circle, repeating after the animated English instructor, SEÑOR SANCHEZ, who goes over some English BASEBALL TERMS in the center. As he repeats the terms, he enthusiastically pantomimes the meanings of each. 
SANCHEZ Fly ball. 
CLASS Fly ball. 
SANCHEZ Line drive. 
CLASS Line drive. 
SANCHEZ Ground ball. 
CLASS Ground ball. 
SANCHEZ Home run! 
CLASS Hone rone! 
CLOSE ON Miguel, repeating the strange words. 
4   INT. RECREATION ROOM - SAME NIGHT                                  4 
It's dark, and most of the team sits around an old TV set watching the climactic final scene of Field of Dreams dubbed in Spanish. Kevin Costner asks his father to play catch in a voice that sounds nothing like Kevin Costner. 
Miguel passes through the room, and we follow him out of the rec room down a hall, and into... 
5   THE WEIGHT ROOM                                                    5 
...where he sits down at the bench press, lowers his head in thought. TRACK IN CLOSE as he crosses himself, mouths a prayer, then leans back onto the bench. 
TRACK OUT as he lifts the bar, and begins a set of presses. 
FADE OUT. 
Misses badly again. JUMP CUTS take us through a half-dozen more bad curve attempts, as other players take notice and gather around, some laughing, until... 
...finally a perfect curve twists dramatically through the air, landing centered in Jose's mitt. 
The other players erupt in amazement, while Miguel stares straight ahead. After a beat, he smiles wide.

9     INT. ACADEMY CLASSROOM - DAY                                       9 
Sr. Sanchez stands in front of a chalkboard, reading off lines of a scripted ENGLISH DIALOGUE for the class to repeat. The class' version of the words are jumbled and incomprehensible. 
SANCHEZ I want to talk to you. 
CLASS I want talk to you. 
SANCHEZ Your performance in the mound is not as good as last year. What is the problem? 
CLASS Your performance in the mound is not good as last year. What is problem? 
SANCHEZ I don't know. Maybe my mechanic. 
CLASS I don't know. Maybe mechanic. 
SANCHEZ I want to give you a chance.   It is up to you... 
CLOSE ON Miguel focused on the baseball in his hand. He practices his knuckle curve grip, not participating in the lesson. 
CLASS I want to give you a chance.   Is up to you... 
10    EXT. BASEBALL ACADEMY - MORNING                                   10 
Miguel walks down a dirt road with his duffel bag. He exits past the gate, waving goodbye to the SECURITY GUARD. 
A10   Beyond the manicured lawns and landscaped gardens of the          A10 Academy, Miguel passes through the overgrown, undeveloped land where neighborhood CHILDREN play among grazing goats. He continues down the dirt road towards a paved highway in the distance, as bachata music fuels the sound track, and carries over the following...

11    INT. MOVING BUS - DAY                                              11 
Thick stalks of sugarcane race through the frame. CLOSE ON Miguel staring out the bus window. On his way home, he passes... 
A11   --half-clothed children flying a homemade kite.                    A11 
B11   --a truck of bananas barrelling by with a boy perched on top.      B11 
C11   --an old man sitting by the street, looking straight at Miguel. C11 
D11   --flaming sugarcane alongside the road.                            D11 
E11   --three children wedged between their parents on a motorbike.      E11 
F11   --the tall, wheezing smokestack of the Cristobal Colon sugar       F11 refinery. 
12    EXT. STREET - SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS -   DAY                         12 
Miguel hops off the bus with his duffel, climbs the pedestrian walkway passing over dozens of rusty railroad cars used for transporting sugarcane to the refinery. We PAN Miguel across the bridge, revealing burning smokestacks in the distance. 
13    EXT. SIDE STREET - MINUTES LATER                                   13 
Modest homes line the neighborhood, fashioned from corrugated tin, painted in bold colors, no two houses alike. A skinny pig roams a barren lot. A group of WOMEN with their hair in curlers sit on crates around a dominoes table. They wave their hellos to Miguel, who smiles back. 
Local KIDS play stickball in a trash-strewn clearing with makeshift mitts fashioned from old milk cartons or cardboard. They see Miguel and rush toward him as he paces up the block, SHOUTING his name. 
As Miguel approaches home, he makes eye contact with a girl, ERICA (15), buying water from a delivery truck. She smiles. 
With the kids still clamoring around Miguel, he stops, unzips his duffel and hands out some used baseballs. The kids grab the balls, then run off to play. 
Miguel approaches Erica.   She puts down her water bucket, gives Miguel a hug. 
MIGUEL How are you, sis? 
ERICA Any news about the States? 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   9. 
MIGUEL Is that all you have to say? 
Miguel helps Erica with the water bucket and walks with her towards their home - a small wooden construction with peeling paint and a rusted aluminum roof. On the lot next to their house, the cinder-block frame of their future home dwarfs the others on the block. 
14   INT. MIGUEL'S HOME - NIGHT                                         14 
Miguel and Erica enter the house, where their brother LUIS (7) watches an enormous television, which feels incongruous in the middle of the tiny, dilapidated home. The reception is still crappy, though. 
Miguel's grandmother, ABUELA, sits upright on her mattress in the corner of the room. 
MIGUEL Hello, Abuela. You're looking beautiful. 
She smiles big at her oldest grandson, opens her arms for a hug. Erica sits at the kitchen table, where her schoolbooks lay open. 
MIGUEL What's up my people?   How's the TV? 
LUIS Erica won't let me watch baseball. 
ERICA Not during American Idol, anyway. 
Miguel's mother, CARMEN (late 30s) emerges from behind a hanging bed sheet, which acts as a "wall" separating two rooms. 
Miguel, Sofia, JAVIER (Black, 22) JAMIE (Black, 26) and ALEXANDRA (one of Sofia's friends) hang out by the malecón (waterside), drinking rum and dancing to merengue that blasts out the open doors of a nearby car. The mood is festive. 
JAVIER (mid-story) I liked her, but she asked me to cut my hair. I thought about it. She was cute, but... I liked my hair more. 
SOFIA I liked it too, Javi. 
MIGUEL Then why'd you cut it last week? 
JAVIER I thought it was time for a new look. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      13. 
MIGUEL Or a new girl. 
Sofia punches Miguel in the arm. 
MIGUEL Watch it, baby, that's a million-dollar arm you're messing with. 
JAVIER He's right!    All hail the golden arm. 
Javier and the girls drunkenly salute Miguel's arm, pretend to dust dirt away, but Jaime doesn't play along. He looks on, a little jealous. 
JAIME You call that flabby rubberband an arm? 
JAVIER Oooh... 
MIGUEL This flabby rubberband can throw 95. What can yours do? 
JAIME I threw 98 in double-A Portland. 
MIGUEL 98? Then why you washing windshields now? I saw you try and bumrush Javy at the stoplight last week. 
Everyone cracks up laughing, including Jaime, as Miguel grabs Sofia, and leads her in a dance. 
His smile fading, Jaime looks out over the water.   Miguel notices this. Hold. 
EXT. SAN PEDRO TOWN - MORNING Various Sunday morning images establishing Miguel's hometown: 
--A dewey mist covers an empty baseball field, surrounded by acres of tall sugarcane. 
--Women hang laundry on the line to dry. 
--A rooster walks alone through a graveyard. 
--People spill out of church into the road. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   14. 
--MIDDLE-AGED MEN drink beer in the dugout during a softball game. 
21   EXT. EMPTY LOT FIELD - DAY                                        21 
A makeshift diamond is overrun with weeds, ditches, stones, and trash for bases. Donkeys graze in the outfield, unphased by the LITTLE KIDS (10-14 years old) playing around them. 
A YOUNG PITCHER fires in a fastball that BEANS the YOUNG HITTER in the back. 
IN THE BLEACHERS, TWO MIDDLE-AGED MEN drink beer and occasionally heckle the kids. 
HECKLER #1 You're supposed to aim for the head! 
Nearby, Miguel sits beside his old coach, FRANK (early 40s), watching the kids play. One of the local SHOE SHINE BOYS cleans Miguel's shoes with an old toothbrush as Frank cracks open a beer. Frank points out one of the kids on the field. 
FRANK I like this one. Good bat speed. Only twelve years old, out here four, five hours everyday. His mom tells me he's missing school. I say, yeah, but... have you seen his swing? 
They laugh. 
FRANK I'm showing his older brother to the Yankees on Monday. 
Miguel nods, a hint of disappointment in his eyes. 
FRANK (seeing this) They don't know what they missed with you. It's cool though. They'll be knocking on your door, offering millions when you turn into a superstar. You'll see... 
Miguel nods, appreciating the vote of confidence. 
MIGUEL Have you been to New York? 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   15. 
FRANK (nodding) Nothing like playing for a crowd of New Yorkers. They're even louder than Dominicans. 
MIGUEL What's the city like? 
FRANK It's great. But you need to get to Kansas City before you start thinking about New York. Know what I mean? 
MIGUEL You hear anything about spring training yet? 
FRANK Yep. 
Frank sips his beer. 
MIGUEL And? 
Frank shrugs, as Miguel's sister calls out from the street-- 
ERICA Miguel, Luis! Dinner is ready! 
MIGUEL You'd tell me if you knew. 
She kisses him on the forehead. 
A SERIES OF JUMPCUTS present a variety of family and friends introducing themselves to Miguel. 
UNCLE ANGEL Miguelito! You gonna remember your uncle Angel when you're all big and famous? Don't forget your family, kid. Never forget where you came from. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
COUSIN LUPE Lupe! Cousin Lupe! Remember that time we went skinny-dipping at the Malecón? 
MIGUEL When? 
JUMP CUT TO: 
COUSING FELIPE You were eight years old! Hated the goats so much. You would cry and cry and cry and cry. What a baby you were. Do you remember? 
JUMP CUT TO: 
MIGUEL What's your name? 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07        25. 
AUNT LOLA Lola!   Your aunt Lola! 
JUMP CUT TO: 
UNCLE JEFFE Uncle Jeffe! 
JUMP CUT TO: 
NEIGHBOR ANA Your neighbor Ana. I grew up around the corner from here. 
Ana lays a juicy kiss on Miguel.   He smiles. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
FRANK Don't give me any shit, kid.      I taught you everything you know. 
Miguel gives Frank a big hug. 
FRANK I'm damn proud of you, kid.    Your father would be, too. 
MIGUEL Thanks.    I owe it all to you. 
FRANK Not all.   Just forty percent. 
Miguel smiles, as Frank leans close. 
FRANK I spent the best years of my life playing in the States. Life gives you a lot of opportunities, but baseball only gives you one. Enjoy every minute of it. 
Miguel nods. 
FRANK How's your new curve? 
MIGUEL It's pretty sweet. 
FRANK Good.   Here... 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   26. 
Frank hands Miguel a pen. 
MIGUEL What's this for? 
FRANK Your autograph. 
Miguel seems puzzled, but searches for something to write on. 
FRANK I'm kidding, you arrogant prick. It's so you can write your family... and me, too... if you feel like it. 
Miguel gives Frank another hug. 
46   INT. MIGUEL'S HOME - LATER                                      46 
Miguel dances salsa with Sofia, and then switches partners, dances with Carmen. 
As he dances close with his mother, he catches a glimpse of Erica standing with some friends off to the side. 
47   EXT. CONSTRUCTION LOT - LATER THAT NIGHT                        47 
Miguel and Erica stand in silhouette, isolated from the party raging outside. Miguel sands one of the legs of the dining table. 
MIGUEL Where's your boyfriend? 
ERICA Which one? 
MIGUEL I don't know; the ugly one. 
ERICA Hector? 
MIGUEL Okay, where's Hector? 
ERICA (shrugs, then) Some other party. 
MIGUEL So what about the good-looking one? 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      27. 
Miguel sends in the next one, and... 
...the HITTER checks his swing, but goes too far. 
UMPIRE Two! 
IN THE DUGOUT Marcos gets to his feet, clapping for encouragement. 
Miguel nods to Orlando, delivers again... 
CRACK! The ball is smoked toward Brad Johnson at second base. He leaps out, body fully extended, and makes a fantastic catch. But he's not done yet... 
The runner at second is too far off the bag, so Brad hops to his feet, and fires a laser beam to second, finishing off one of the sweetest double-plays you'll ever see. 
Miguel pumps his fist into the air, and the team runs to... 
67   THE DUGOUT                                                         67 
Marcos and Julio are the first to greet Miguel with high-fives. Orlando, Ed, and Jorge, coming off the field, follow in suit. Miguel awaits Brad's return to the dugout and high-fives him too, but they soon return to their segregated places on opposite ends of the bench. 
68   INT. CLUBHOUSE - DAY                                               68 
Most of the players are gone or heading out when Miguel approaches his catcher, Orlando, a few lockers away. 
MIGUEL Where did you learn English so good? 
ORLANDO Back home in Caracas. 
MIGUEL Like in high school, or something? 
ORLANDO Yeah, but it's still hard though. People talk fast. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   36. 
Miguel agrees, as an ASSISTANT COACH finishes handing out checks to the remaining players. 
Miguel sits on the bench near his locker, opens his envelope to find... 
INSERT:   a check for $502.18. 
He SMILES. 
69   INT. CLASSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                                    69 
The ENGLISH INSTRUCTOR goes over baseball related vocabulary off- screen, while Miguel glances through his "English for Baseball Players" notebook. 
He finds a page with pictures of different foods along with their English names. He looks at all the foods, stops at an image of a fried egg. He circles the word "egg." 
The instructor finishes up class, and the exhausted Latino players get up to leave. Marcos stands, leans over to Miguel. 
MARCOS C'mon.    Let's grab some dinner. 
MIGUEL Nah, I'm gonna stay and work out a little. I'll catch up later. 
70   INT. WEIGHT ROOM - NIGHT                                           70 
Miguel does bicep curls alone in the weight room, when... 
...Brad Johnson enters. They exchange hello gestures, and proceed to workout on opposite sides of the room. After finishing his set, Miguel turns to Brad. 
MIGUEL (struggling in English) Good catch. 
BRAD Thanks... I got lucky. 
They continue with their respective routines. 
71   INT. WESTERN UNION - NIGHT                                         71 
CLOSE ON Miguel's hands counting out seven fifty-dollar bills. 
He approaches the CLERK behind thick, bullet-proof glass, and slides the money and routing slip through a retractable tray. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07       37. 
He smiles BIG at the clerk.      Proud. 
72    INT. ALL NIGHT DINER - NIGHT                                            72 
The usual waitress hovers over Miguel, alone at the usual booth. 
WAITRESS French toast, right? 
MIGUEL No...   Egg.    Egg, please. 
WAITRESS Eggs. No problem. How would you like'm? 
Miguel stares at her. 
MIGUEL Yes. 
WAITRESS Um, okay, uh... Scrambled?       Over easy? Sunny side up? 
A beat... He didn't count on this part.      He thinks hard, pressure mounting. 
MIGUEL (giving up, embarrassed) French toast. 
WAITRESS No eggs?   You sure? 
JORGE Thank you.   This is Miguel. 
Orlando whistles to Jorge from a taxi. 
JORGE I go now.    Take care of my friend. 
Jorge waves goodbye to the Higgins, pats Miguel on the back, and hops in a cab with Orlando and Ed. 
Awkward beat, as Miguel, Earl, and Helen stand in silence. 
77   EXT/INT. HIGGINS CAR - DAY                                         77 
Earl and Helen ramble on in English, while Miguel spaces out the back window at the passing corn stalks, which are strikingly similar to the sugar cane stalks back home. 
HELEN We've had Dominicans, Venezuelan boys, a Colombian, one from Panama, blacks and some Americans. Mostly Spanish boys, though. Johan Santana, Mendy Lopez and Ramon Martinez all stayed with us. Years ago. 
EARL Last year we had this boy, Junior Sanchez. Nice boy. Decent with the glove, but couldn't bunt to save his life. 
HELEN Two-for-twelve in sacrifice situations. 
EARL Cost the team at least two victories.

HELEN Oh, that's being generous!   I'd say four or five. 
78    INT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - DAY                                         78

HELEN Put your things down.   I'll show you around. 
79    INT. KITCHEN                                                         79 
HELEN This is the kitchen. Help yourself to whatever you'd like. You can make a list of special foods you like to eat and put it here. 
Helen points to a grocery list tucked under a broccoli magnet. 
HELEN Oh, and over here, this drawer is a little funny. 
She pulls open the silverware drawer. 
HELEN You have to be careful or... 
She pulls it a little too far and it falls off its rail.    Miguel nods. 
80    INT. WASHER/DRYER ROOM                                               80 
HELEN This is the washer and the dryer. For your clothes. You put the soap in this one. Sopa. 
Miguel looks at her, confused.   Did she just say "soup"? 
HELEN (CONT'D) The other one's just hot air. Caliente. 
A80   INT. STAIRCASE                                                    A80

Miguel smiles, understanding.

Earl and Helen break down the rules for Miguel at the table. 
EARL No drinking. No cervezas in the casa. No chicas in the bedroom. 
HELEN I already told him that one. 
EARL Okay.     What about quiet time? 
HELEN Right. There's no real curfew, but you must be quiet after ten. 
EARL Diez. (holding index finger to mouth) Shhhh... after diez. 
MIGUEL Ten.     Okay. 
HELEN Si! That's all we ask. It's our job to keep you healthy and focused on baseball. 
EARL And we take pride in that. 
Miguel smiles.

MICHAEL This is good old-fashioned American home cooking, Miguel. Welcome to America. 
MIGUEL I like.   Thank you. 
EARL Well, very good, Miguel. De nada to you, mi amigo. De nada to you. 
Anne smiles at Miguel, a little embarrassed by her grandpa. Miguel smiles back, then gets back to his meatloaf. 
87   INT. BRIDGETOWN SWING CLUBHOUSE - DAY                               87 
The team's CLUBHOUSE MANAGER (19, redheaded freckle face), hands out schedules to a handful of returning players. 
CLUBBY If you guys ever need tickets for family or friends, just let me know two days ahead of time. Thursday's opener is already sold out, but I saved one row, so you need to speak up now... 
Miguel enters the room, looking for his locker.    The Clubby takes notice. 
CLUBBY Santos - you're over there. 
Clubby points Miguel in the right direction, where he finds his locker and several pressed jerseys waiting for him. Miguel takes his practice jersey, sits down in front of the locker, as... 
BRAD (O.S.) (in bad Spanish) Que pasa, hermano? 
Brad pats Miguel on the back.    Miguel is excited to see a familiar face. 
MIGUEL (in bad English) What up, Flaco? 
BRAD Dude, I was totally psyched when I saw your name on the squad. Good times. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     47. 
MIGUEL Yeah, okay. 
Brad finds his locker, and they both suit up. 
88   INT/EXT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - MINUTES LATER                      88 
We follow Miguel through the tunnel, which leads out to the... 
89   BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK FIELD                                   89 
A stunning little park that sits at the Mississippi River's edge, underneath the Crescent Bridge. A dozen scattered players warm up on the lush green grass. 
A wide-eyed Miguel steps onto the field for the first time and takes it all in. Hold. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
90   INT. WESTLAND MALL - DAY                                           90 
Miguel and Jorge stroll through the mall. Miguel notes the steady barrage of discount signs, plastic jewelry kiosks, and product samples. 
91   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - MINUTES LATER                              91 
Miguel follows Jorge through the men's section when a rack of Hanes underwear catches his eye. He turns a package over. 
INSERT: in a little corner of the package Miguel reads, "MADE IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC". 
He checks the price tag. 
JORGE C'mon, bro, let's find you a suit. 
MIGUEL I can't afford a suit. 
JORGE I didn't say buy a suit. I said find a suit. So when you make it big, you'll already know what looks good. 
92   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE SUIT SECTION - NOT MUCH LATER                92 
Miguel emerges from the dressing room in a white suit and electric blue collared shirt. 
JORGE Hot damn!   That's what's up! 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07       48. 
MIGUEL You like it? 
JORGE I love it!   You look like an all-star, bro. 
Miguel admires himself in the mirror. 
JORGE (in a fake announcer voice, in English) "Starting pitcher for American League... from Kansas City... Miguel... 'Sugar'... Santos." 
Jorge fakes massive crowd applause.   Miguel laughs. 
MIGUEL What about you, man?   You try one. 
Jorge shrugs, smiles. 
JORGE Me?   Nah... I'm all washed up. 
MIGUEL C'mon... 
Jorge gets distracted by a pack of TEENAGE GIRLS cruising by. They smile at the players, who smile back. 
MIGUEL Very nice. 
JORGE Dude. You have no idea. Just wait till we go to Big Muddy's. 
MIGUEL Big Muddy's? 
As Miguel and Jorge carve and twist with their partners, several local bar PATRONS begin to take notice of their fancy footwork. But Miguel might be dancing too well for one DRUNK JACKASS in particular, who... 
...wanders over, gets in Miguel's face. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     52. 
JACKASS (barely audible) Careful, Paco. This ain't the jungle. 
Miguel stares him down. A few clubbers in the immediate vicinity stop dancing, observe. Jorge steps between them, and... 
...apparently, drunken egos speak the same language everywhere because Jorge and the Jackass start jawing back and forth in their native tongues. Both seem to be understanding the other, though the MUSIC is too loud to hear anything specific. 
Brad and the Venezuelans run over to break it up before anything serious starts. They all hustle out to... 
102   EXT. BIG MUDDY'S PARKING LOT - NIGHT                              102 
The Latin players spill out into the brisk night air with Brad and the Swing's designated hitter, JEFF ELKS. 
They all pile into Brad's car, as a few locals stand near the club's entrance, watching them go. 
103   EXT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - NIGHT                                    103 
The car pulls up near the house and Miguel stumbles out, as the wild bunch inside HOOT and HOLLER. 
The car backs down the road and the players' voices fade out with the hum of the engine. 
An upstairs light goes on. Miguel looks up to the Higgins' bedroom where Helen's silhouetted figure lingers in the window. He tiptoes inside. 
The sound of a CHURCH CHOIR fades in, and carries over to... 
104   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                                 104 
With the exception of Miguel, the all-white congregation sings hymns about Jesus and the Lord. He tries to suppress a yawn when he sees Anne Higgins singing in the choir. She notices him as she sings. A smile. 
Miguel perks up. 
105   EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY                                     105 
CHURCHGOERS flood out of the church after the service.    Anne walks alongside Miguel. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   53. 
ANNE How'd you like the service? (off his blank stare) Our church? Hope it wasn't too boring for you. Did you go to church in the Dominican Republic? 
He shakes his head. 
MIGUEL I am sorry.    I do not understand. 
ANNE S'okay. You understand more than a lot of folks around here I bet. 
He nods, still unsure. 
ANNE So listen, me and some friends   are hanging out later. You should    stop by my house after the game. It's    gonna be super chill. Grandma can take    you there, but here... 
She stops a random CHURCHGOER... 
ANNE Can I borrow a pen real quick? 
The churchgoer hands over a pen, and Anne writes her address on Miguel's forearm. 
ANNE After the game. My house...     Good luck, tonight. 
Anne runs off.   Miguel looks after her, mystified. 
106   INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON                             106 
Half-uniformed players hang out, eating sandwiches, passing around a PLAYBOY magazine, signing souvenir baseballs, and talking at full volume. Hip-hop BLASTS from a stereo, competing with an old DUKES OF HAZARD rerun on the TV. HARDY, the Bridgetown Swing mascot, passes through with his enormous monkey head under one arm. 
Miguel sits at his locker, psyching himself up for his first start. He touches Luis' drawing, which is taped to the inside of his locker. Closes his eyes, takes a deep breath. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      54. 
107   EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                    107 
ON THE MOUND. Miguel opens his eyes, as the LEAD-OFF HITTER steps into the batter's box. He takes a moment, crosses himself. Play ball. 
Miguel nods to his catcher, Orlando, then fires in the first pitch high for a ball. 
When he gets the ball back, he looks to the stands, where... 
...Earl, Helen, Michael, and Hilary sit uncomfortably close to the field in choice box seats. 
He takes a nervous breath, fires in the second pitch.      Ball two. Same for the third. And forth. 
The batter jogs to first, and the crowd GRUMBLES. 
108   INT. RADIO ANNOUNCERS' BOOTH                                        108 
Jack Jefferies does his thing on the mic. 
JACK JEFFERIES Santos, apparently feeling the butterflies on his first professional outing. Hailing all the way from the Dominican Republic, Santos wowed the club with his power during Spring Training. But he's off to a rocky start tonight. 
109   ON THE MOUND                                                        109 
Jorge comes over from third base as the batter walks to first. 
JORGE Relax, Sugar. It's the same game we played back home. That's all it is. Just a game, man. So relax. Let's have some fun. Okay? 
Miguel puts his ear to the door again, but can't hear anything, so he returns to the desk, begins carving again. 
134   EXT/INT. MOVING BUS - DAY                                         134 
Orlando and Ed play a spirited game of Casino on a Gatorade jug in the aisle while Miguel, Jorge and Brad chat about movies. 
BRAD Did you ever see "Y Tu Mama Tambien"? 
MIGUEL Y tu mama what? 
BRAD Y Tu Mama Tambien... It's Mexican. 
Jorge laughs, shakes his head. 
MIGUEL No, I don't know this. 
BRAD What are your favorite movies? 
JORGE Terminator. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    64. 
MIGUEL I like Matrisse. 
JORGE Oh, Matrisse. Very strong. 
BRAD Matrisse?   What's that? 
MIGUEL He doesn't know Matrisse? 
JORGE You don't know The Matrisse? 
BRAD The Mattress? I don't know. (turns to Jeff, beside him) Dude, do you know a movie called The Mattress? 
JEFF The Mattress? 
JORGE With Keanu...? 
JEFF Keanu Reeves? 
BRAD Oh, shit!   The MATRIX!! 
MIGUEL Matrisse! 
BRAD Yeah, yeah, the Matrix is badass.   I was like, Mattress? What? 
135   INT. MIGUEL'S BEDROOM - DUSK                                        135 
He finishes   up a birthday card to his sister Erica, encloses it in a padded   envelope along with the wooden etching he carved earlier - a   pendant with a cornstalk design. The NYC calendar on the wall   in the background indicates we are now in JUNE. 
When he's done, he goes to his duffel, pulls out his English language workbook. 
Miguel sits on his bed, opens the book. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07     65. 
136   EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - DAY                             136 
A batter swings and misses for strike three.    The catcher throws the ball around the horn. 
Miguel steps off the mound, grabs the rosin bag for traction, gets the ball back. 
His next pitch is hit on the ground toward the first base line, where the first baseman makes a nice back-handed play... 
Miguel sprints over to cover the bag, receives the toss, but... 
OUCH! 
...the RUNNER storms into Miguel before he has time to pull his foot off the bag, knocking them both hard to the ground.   The runner is called out, but Miguel is slow getting to his feet. 
Stu and the TRAINER run out to check on him. Jorge rushes over from third, and Orlando also comes to help translate. 
STU Nice play, kid.     How's your foot? 
JORGE You okay? 
Miguel nods, but he's limping back to the mound. 
STU Take it easy. Don't force it.     How's it feel? 
ORLANDO (translating) Don't push it. Does it hurt? 
MIGUEL I'm okay. 
STU Let him toss a few warm-ups. 
The umpire grants Miguel a few "test" pitches. 
Visibly shaken, Miguel sets up for a warm-up pitch, breathes deeply, and delivers. He lands gingerly on his right ankle, makes a face. 
Stu and the trainer exchange glances. Miguel notices this, as he sets up for another pitch. The trainer shakes his head, no. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07       66. 
STU All right, kid.     Give it a rest. 
As Stu reaches for the ball, Miguel pulls it away. 
Anne looks down at her feet, uncomfortable. 
ANNE Sorry, I just...      Sorry. 
Miguel looks on, confused, as she stands.   They lock eyes for an awkward beat. 
ANNE I should help clean up... 
On her way back inside... 
ANNE We have another meeting Thursday...    If you can come. 
Miguel nods. Anne leaves him on the porch alone.     He looks out over the corn fields. 
139   INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - DAY                                          139 
Miguel enters the near-empty room limping on his blue boot, finds Jorge wearing street clothes and packing up personal things from his locker. Miguel knows immediately what's happened. 
They make eye contact from across the locker room.   Nobody moves. After a beat... 
JORGE I had a good run. 
MIGUEL What happened? 
JORGE It's over. 
MIGUEL Why? 
JORGE You know the drill. I'm not playing well, so they'll bring up somebody who is. 
MIGUEL What about your knee? You just need some more time... You're recovering. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   70. 
JORGE Sugar... 
Miguel relents. 
MIGUEL When do you leave? 
JORGE They want me to fly back tonight. 
MIGUEL Tonight?! 
JORGE But I'm not going back... 
A beat as Miguel lets this sink in. 
JORGE I gotta cousin in New York. 
MIGUEL You're going to New York? 
JORGE Where else? There's no work back home. My bonus won't last forever... 
Miguel looks off.    Jorge senses his anxiety. 
JORGE Relax Sugar, I'll see you at Yankee Stadium someday... when the Knights come to town. I'll be in the front row, getting drunk, and cheering the loudest. 
Miguel smiles. 
JORGE Not for you though. Yankee fans are crazy. I can't take the risk... I'll call you. 
A beat as Miguel looks at Jorge with concern.    Jorge shakes it off. 
JORGE You worry too much, Sugar. I'll be okay. I mean, it's just a game, right? 
Miguel nods. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   71. 
140    INT. SOFIA'S HOUSE (DOMINICAN REPUBLIC) - NIGHT                   140 
A140   Sofia on the phone. We INTERCUT between her and Miguel IN HIS A140 BEDROOM, his injured ankle elevated on a pillow. 
SOFIA How'd you play tonight? 
MIGUEL (hesitant) Good, good. 
SOFIA I bet you have lots of groupies waiting for you after your games. 
MIGUEL I have a few. 
SOFIA A few? 
MIGUEL Just kidding. I mean I would, but none of these white girls speak Spanish. Marcos plays in Arizona. Lots of Mexicans; everyone speaks Spanish. He has like fifteen girlfriends. 
SOFIA Shut up! 
MIGUEL He's probably lying though. 
SOFIA I bet he's lying. 
A beat, as Miguel shifts gears... 
MIGUEL Jorge went to New York. 
SOFIA To the Yankees? 
Miguel sits, gets back to work on the drawer.    Anne looks at him for a second, then exits. 
Miguel glances out the window, watches Anne climb into a pickup truck idling in the driveway. Anne and Miguel make brief eye contact before the truck speeds away, a trail of dust following it into the distance. 
A146   EXT. CORN FIELDS - DUSK                                           A146 
Miguel walks down a path in the middle of the Higgins' corn field. He finds a cob of corn, removes the leaves, and examines the kernels up close. 
ZOOM IN to ECU of a single kernel. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    75. 
Miguel stares at the raw corn with strange fascination. 
FADE OUT. 
147   INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE - DAY                                        147 
Miguel walks in without crutches, looking healthy. He pounds a few players hello, then freezes upon seeing Brad's empty locker. 
Stu approaches Miguel... 
STU There was an injury to the Wichita right-fielder. They called up Brad this morning... He left you this... 
Stu hands Miguel an old paperback book. 
INSERT: a Spanish-language version of Roberto Clemente's biography. Miguel opens to the first page, where Brad has inscribed a note, "See you in Kansas City, Mamañema!" 
Miguel smiles, bittersweet, when a familiar VOICE calls out... 
SALVADOR Yo!   Sugar! 
Miguel turns around to find Salvador Torres (the once scrawny kid from the Academy) running at him. They hug. 
MIGUEL Holy shit!     How'd you get here? 
SALVADOR On a airplane, motherfucker. 
Miguel playfully flips Salvador's cap bill down over his face for being a smartass. 
STU Great, you guys know each other. Sal's our new middle-relief man. Throws a nasty cutter. You could learn a thing or two from him, Santos... 
MIGUEL Okay. 
Stu walks back towards the coaches' office. 
SALVADOR What he say? 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    76. 
MIGUEL (not sure himself) Don't worry about it... Good to see you. 
SALVADOR Good to see you, too, Sugar. (a beat) I'm a little nervous. 
MIGUEL Look, just remember... it's the same game we played back home. Same rules, different place. Just have fun. It's only a game. 
148    EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - NIGHT                           148 
CLOSE ON Miguel swearing at himself, clearly not following his own advice. 
A RUNNER circles the bases after hitting a homerun. 
JACK JEFFERIES (V.O.) Santos allows his second homerun of the game.   First night off the DL, and not looking so sharp. 
The SCOREBOARD indicates the Swing losing 5-2 in the 4th. 
Miguel glances out of the corner of his eye to... 
THE DUGOUT 
...Stu is scribbling on his scorecard. 
MIGUEL quickly sets up for his next pitch, but Stu is on his way out to the mound. Miguel glances back to the bullpen, where Salvador is warming up. 
Stu signals for Salvador to come in, and we follow Miguel off the field to scattered applause. 
A148   IN THE RADIO BOOTH Jack Jefferies continues his play-by-play ofA148 the game. 
JACK JEFFERIES Sutton makes the call to pull Santos here in the 4th, bringing in rookie reliever, Salvador Torres for his Bridgetown debut. 
B148   IN THE DUGOUT.   Miguel sits on the bench, throws a towel over    B148 his head. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07       77. 
ON THE MOUND.   Salvador warms up, looking a little freaked. 
Players and fans marvel over Sal's unorthodox, side-armed delivery. His form is reminiscent of A's legend, Dennis Eckersly, but without the grace. 
MIGUEL peaks through his towel at the action... 
ON THE FIELD.   Salvador takes a deep breath, delivers his first pitch... 
UMPIRE Strike! 
Salvador seems to relax.    Winds up his next pitch, and... 
...the ball appears to zig-zag across the plate, freezing the hitter in confusion. 
Jeff Elks instructs Miguel, alone, in the small room with a flickering fluorescent light. 
JEFF Listen, your first time, take a half. Okay? No more. You gotta ease into it. Half. 
Miguel nods. 
JEFF And anyone finds these, you didn't get them from me, okay? 
Before Miguel can respond, Salvador enters with his dirty laundry. Miguel hides the pills. 
SALVADOR What's up? 
JEFF What's up, Sal? 
Jeff heads out.    Miguel resumes folding his clothes. 
SALVADOR Did you hear I made player of the week? 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      81. 
MIGUEL You told me last night. 
Salvador examines his detergent options from the dispenser machine. 
SALVADOR Which one do you use? 
Miguel eyes the bleach.    Can't help himself. 
MIGUEL That one. 
SALVADOR Thanks. 
Salvador inserts coins into the machine, pulls the bleach lever. 
159    INT. SWING CLUBHOUSE BATHROOM STALL - THE NEXT EVENING             159 
Miguel pops two pills.    Exits out into the... 
160    SWING CLUBHOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                       160 
...where Salvador undresses out of his bleach-stained street clothes. Miguel walks past without acknowledging him. 
161    EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                   161 
THE CAMERA eerily floats toward and around Miguel on the mound. He stares down the HITTER, totally focused. He touches his cross, whispers a prayer to himself. 
Winds up, throws, and... 
THUD! 
...a cloud of dust pops off the catcher's mitt, just like the old days. Miguel's "stuff" is back. And he knows it. 
A161   IN THE STANDS. Earl and Helen settle into their box seats          A161 eating caramel corn and cola. 
B161   RADIO ANNOUNCERS BOOTH.    Jack Jefferies at the mic...            B161 
JACK JEFFERIES Miguel Santos appears to be in top form tonight, striking out two of three in the first. I don't want to jinx it, but this sure looks like the Santos we knew earlier this season. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    82. 
C161   IN THE DUGOUT. There's an intensity we haven't seen before in C161 Miguel. We get the sense he's treating this game like it could be his last. 
162    ON THE MOUND - 2ND INNING                                           162 
CLOSE ON MIGUEL.    Sweating more than he should at this point in the game, but... 
...who cares? He continues to dominate opposing hitters, striking out two more in the 2nd. 
A162   IN THE STANDS.   Earl and Helen CHEER for their Miguel.           A162 
163    IN THE DUGOUT - LATER THAT NIGHT                                    163 
Still sweating, Miguel is now shifting his jaw back-and-forth. The SOUND FADES LOW, as he stares onto the field, sees... 
...the teams changing sides between innings, everyone moving in subtle SLOW-MOTION (36 fps). 
Stu approaches Miguel, puts his hand on his shoulder. We see him mouth the words, "You okay?", but NO SOUND comes out. 
Miguel nods, yes. 
164    BACK ON THE FIELD - 5TH INNING                                      164 
And back in real time (24 fps). Miguel fires his first pitch over the head of his catcher and all the way to the backstop. Orlando motions for him to calm down. 
The next pitch is closer, but still high. 
And the next pitch BEANS the hitter in the thigh. 
Miguel swears at himself, tries hard to calm down, but his heart is racing. 
A164   IN THE RADIO BOOTH                                                A164 
JACK JEFFERIES Top of the fifth and Santos is showing some control issues. Not sure what's going on down there, but he seems to be talking to himself. 
B164   ON THE MOUND, Orlando runs out to Miguel.                         B164 
ORLANDO Don't worry about it. You're all good. Just relax. Throw strikes. They can't touch you. Just throw strikes. 
PLAY 3: A reliever warms up in the foreground. Miguel stares ahead, deadpan, while the others chat and spit chewing tobacco. 
PLAY 4: A new reliever warms up, then runs out onto the field, leaving only two others with Miguel. 
PLAY 5: Miguel stares ahead, while the crowd does the "Chicken Dance" behind him. 
PLAY 6: The fans leap to their feet in applause. The two relievers high-five. Miguel CLAPS, going through the motions. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07         86. 
PLAY 7: Miguel chews and spits sunflower seed shells as the fans sing along to "Take Me Out to the Ball Game." 
PLAY 8: Another reliever runs out onto the field, leaving only Miguel and one other guy. 
PLAY 9:   Miguel is finally warming up, ready to enter the game, but... 
...the fans leap to their feet, CHEERING victoriously. Game over. The only other reliever grabs his jacket, and heads out onto the field. 
As the players and fans   head for the exits, Miguel remains on the bullpen mound for a   beat. He nods to himself, oddly at peace with the moment.    Miguel steps off the mound and we PAN with him, as he crosses   frame, and makes the long walk to the dugout. Hold. 
170   INT. MIGUEL'S BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON                                170 
Miguel grabs a slip of paper from his nightstand. His large duffel bag is packed full in front of him. On the wall, his NYC calendar is turned to AUGUST. 
He goes to the phone.   Dials... 
After a long beat he hangs up. 
171   INT. HIGGINS FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING                            171 
Helen walks in to find Miguel washing the dishes in the sink. 
HELEN Oh, honey, you don't have to do that. 
MIGUEL (his English better than ever) No problem. I want to help. 
HELEN Well, thank you, Miguel. 
Helen grabs a dish towel.      They do the dishes together in silence. After a beat... 
MIGUEL Thank you, Helen. 
Helen smiles, pats Miguel on the back.     HOLD. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   87. 
172   EXT. BRIDGETOWN SWING BALL PARK - EARLY MORNING                   172 
Earl drops off Miguel near the team bus, as players and coaches load their gear in, and get on. 
Miguel cautiously approaches the bus, sees Salvador, hesitates... 
MIGUEL I forgot something in the clubhouse. I'll be right back. 
As Miguel turns, Salvador grabs his bag, which is still on his shoulder. 
SALVADOR Here, I'll load your bag. 
Miguel grips his bag tighter and the two of them lock eyes. Salvador senses his intensity, releases the bag. Miguel backs away with Salvador looking on. 
ED Where's he going? 
SALVADOR Bathroom. 
AT THE CLUBHOUSE ENTRANCE Miguel turns back to the bus, sees... 
...Salvador eyeing him from the open bus window.   Sal raises his hand, very subtly waves goodbye. 
Miguel continues on his way. 
173   EXT. BURLINGTON BUS DEPOT - MINUTES LATER                         173 
A local taxi pulls up, and Miguel hops out with his duffel bag.

Miguel steps on, moves past the other PASSENGERS, finds an empty seat towards the back. He sits down, catches his breath, and whispers a prayer to himself. When he's done, he looks across the aisle, where an OLD LADY is staring at him. 
He shoots her a cautious smile. 
175   INT. MOVING BUS - DAY/EVENING                                     175 
Miguel stares, wide-eyed, out the window at the shifting landscapes, daytime into evening... 
--cornstalks. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07    88. 
--bridges and rivers. 
--city lights. 
He sleeps against the window, his Clemente book open on his lap.

From the New Jersey turnpike, Miguel sees the approaching Manhattan skyline in the early morning light. He sits up straight, looks attentively at the city emerging in the distance. 
SECURITY GUARD (in English) You wanta see the inside, you gotta buy a ticket, pal. 
MIGUEL (jumping down) Sorry. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   91.

With his duffel on his lap, Miguel sits on a bench overlooking a a community baseball field, where local KIDS play for fun. He stares off blankly, preoccupied with other things.

Miguel sidesteps a nodding JUNKY on his way to the front desk, approaches the toothless Russian clerk, NIKOLAI (late 50s). 
MIGUEL One room. 
NIKOLAI For how long? 
MIGUEL I don't know. 
NIKOLAI Two hundred a week.   First week in advance. 
As Miguel tries to piece together what was just said, he notices a rack of condoms beside a set of long distance calling cards on the front desk. The name of the calling card is ALÓ MAMÁ! 
NIKOLAI Two hundred now. 
Miguel reaches for the calling card. 
MIGUEL This also please.

Miguel turns on the light to find a small bed in the corner of the room. There's also a desk with a phone. Miguel puts down his duffel and sits at the desk. He examines the calling card for a beat, then goes to the window, looks out. Hold.

Miguel strolls by various stores and restaurants. He passes outside a WOODEN CABINET STORE, where 5-6 Dominican men, ranging in age from 20 to 50 years old, make furniture in the shop. He stops for a beat, watching the men work.

Miguel approaches a man, OSVALDO (late 50s), who works at his desk on the computer. 
MIGUEL You speak Spanish? 
OSVALDO Of course. 
MIGUEL Is this your place? 
OSVALDO Yeah.    Can I help you? 
Miguel glances around at the various wooden furniture items for sale. 
MIGUEL I like your work. 
OSVALDO Thanks.    What are you looking for? 
MIGUEL Oh, no, I mean... I don't know. I was passing by and thought maybe you might need some help. I know how to make furniture, and-- 
OSVALDO --I don't have any work right now. Sorry. 
MIGUEL Right.    Okay, thanks for your time. 
Osvaldo gets back to his computer, but Miguel lingers... 
MIGUEL Do you know any other places like this where I might find work? 
OSVALDO Have you checked the classifieds?

Miguel sips soda from a straw as he leafs through the classifieds in a Spanish-language daily. 
INSERT: Various employment ads, requiring experience, fluency in English, working papers, etc. 
Miguel glances up, stares out the window. Rafael, the busboy from the other day, wipes down the table next to Miguel. 
RAFAEL If you leave a number, I'll give it to him next time he comes through.

MIGUEL (into phone) Erica? 
A194   We INTERCUT between Miguel and his home in the Dominican         A194 Republic. 
RAFAEL It's okay. I'd rather watch soccer though... Have you found him yet? 
MIGUEL Not yet. 
RAFAEL He'll be through sooner or later. 
MIGUEL How long have you worked here? 
RAFAEL Two years. 
MIGUEL Do you have family here? 
RAFAEL No. My wife and kids are still in Mexico.

Loud, overexaggerated SEX SOUNDS filter in from another room, while Miguel reads the last page of the Clemente biography. After a beat, he closes the book, listens. 
200   INT. WOODEN CABINET SHOP - EARLY EVENING                          200 
Two EMPLOYEES say goodbye to Osvaldo as Miguel enters the shop. Miguel approaches Osvaldo, who is sanding a table. 
MIGUEL Hi, um, do you remember me? 
OSVALDO Yeah, but, sorry, I still don't have a job for you. 
MIGUEL That's okay. I already found one. I'm actually just trying to make a coffee table, and I'd like to buy some wood and supplies. 
OSVALDO I don't really sell raw materials... 
Miguel hesitates. 
MIGUEL I just moved here, you know, and I don't have a space to work. Do you think I could do some work for you, help you clean up or whatever you need, in exchange for using your shop? You don't have to pay me. 
Osvaldo sizes up Miguel's unusual request. 
OSVALDO Somebody paying you for the table? 
MIGUEL No. It's a gift for my mom.   Something I like to do. 
OSVALDO How old are you? 
MIGUEL Twenty. 
OSVALDO Who taught you to make tables? 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   98. 
MIGUEL My dad.     He was a carpenter in San Pedro. 
OSVALDO Is that where you're from? 
MIGUEL Yeah. 
OSVALDO I grew up in Santiago.    What are you doing in New York? 
MIGUEL I came to work. I used to play baseball. 
Osvaldo nods, understanding. 
OSVALDO The whole world plays baseball. My son's sixteen. Won't touch a piece of wood that's not a bat. I never cared for the game, myself. Too slow. 
Miguel laughs. 
OSVALDO Your mom still in San Pedro? 
MIGUEL Yeah.    With my sister and brother. 
OSVALDO So, you're telling me that you want to make a table for your mom, then mail it back to her in the Dominican? 
Miguel nods.   Osvaldo smiles, finally warming up. 
OSVALDO What's your name? 
MIGUEL Miguel. 
They shake hands. 
OSVALDO Osvaldo.

Miguel hesitates, unsure where to begin.      Osvaldo senses his discomfort with the question. 
OSVALDO Do you have any family here? 
MIGUEL (shaking his head) But I'm okay... I have some money saved, a couple friends. I'll go home to visit soon. 
Osvaldo doesn't quite buy it, but nods anyway. 
MIGUEL Do you know a place called Ukraine? 
208   INT. PARADISE HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                                     208 
Miguel attempts to slip past Nikolai, who is currently checking in another GUEST, but... 
NIKOLAI Hey!   You owe money.   Full week! 
MIGUEL I know.    I have tomorrow.   No problem. 
NIKOLAI Yes, problem. You pay tomorrow or you have big problem. 
Miguel continues up the stairs.

Unable to sleep, Miguel lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, when he overhears a commotion from across the hall. 
After a beat, he hears a door open and SLAM SHUT. 
He goes to the door, listens close.     It's quiet, until... 
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK 
Miguel flinches.    Then slowly cracks open the door to find... 
...Raquel standing before him with a small leather duffel bag. 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07   103. 
RAQUEL (handing him the bag) Love, keep this in your room for me. Just a few hours. Til morning. I'll be back. 
She forces the bag into his hands, kisses him on the cheek, and retreats into her own room. 
Miguel closes the door, still holding the bag. He sets it on his bed, stares at it. After a few beats, he grabs it, stuffs it under the bed, out of sight. 
He sits down at the desk, stares at the bed, when he hears SHOUTING from the hall. Again, he goes to the door, listens. 
Another MAN POUNDS on Raquel's door, SCREAMING in Ukrainian, while Nikolai YELLS at the man in English, though Miguel can't make out exactly what's going on. The shouting intensifies until a SCUFFLE breaks out. A woman SCREAMS. Miguel reaches for the door handle, but stops himself. 
He steps into his BATHROOM, shuts the door, sits on the toilet. The muffled SHOUTING continues. Miguel waits. 
FADE OUT. 
210   INT. MIGUEL'S ROOM - LATER                                        210 
Now quiet, Miguel stares at the mysterious bag on his bed, then heads for the door with his packed duffel over his shoulder. He puts his ear to the door, then exits, leaving the other bag behind. 
211   INT. PARADISE HOTEL HALLWAY                                       211

Miguel dials his calling card number into the phone, listens... 
MIGUEL Frank... It's Miguel. 
We hold on Miguel, though we can hear Frank's muffled voice through the receiver. 
FRANK (O.S.) Jesus, Miguel, what the hell happened? 
Official Shooting Script as of 10/22/07      104. 
MIGUEL Sorry for calling late.    I'm in New York. 
FRANK (O.S.) I heard. You're making me look bad. What are you doing there? 
MIGUEL I got a job, but I don't know if I'm going to stay... 
FRANK (O.S.) Where you gonna go? The season's over... Your visa's expired. 
MIGUEL I know, but I thought maybe I could... 
A beat, as Miguel drifts off. 
FRANK I can talk to Alvarez... But I don't know. Nobody's happy about this. 
Miguel bites his lip.   A police SIREN flies by. 
MIGUEL I know.   Sorry. 
FRANK (O.S.) Look, Miguel-- 
Miguel hangs up the phone.

Miguel, Osvaldo, and his wife, ESTELLA, eat dinner at the table. The music continues under the following scene... 
OSVALDO I did some research and I got a new favorite player now. 
MIGUEL Okay, good. 
OSVALDO Vic Power.    You know him? 
Miguel shakes his head, no. 
OSVALDO You ought to. Greatest Puerto Rican first baseman ever. But that's not why he's my favorite player... Back when he first arrived, 1951, 52, he was playing in the minors. Little Rock, Arkansas. So the story goes, one day before a game, Vic stops into this diner for lunch. Hadn't been here long, so he knew very little English. Didn't even notice the "whites only" sign hanging in the window. And Vic was Black. I looked him up on Google. I mean Black like you. So he sits down at the counter and the little waitress comes up to big Vic and says, "I'm sorry, we don't serve colored people." 
Osvaldo pauses for dramatic effect, as Miguel and Estella eagerly await what comes next. 
OSVALDO So he leans close to the waitress, tells her in his best English, "That's okay, I don't eat colored people." 
After a beat, Estella laughs, but Miguel is unsure.   Osvaldo does his best to explain the joke in Spanish.

CARMEN I got the photos you sent, but you'll have to send more. 
MIGUEL Okay, mom, but you know it would be a lot easier if you opened an email account. 
CARMEN Email? I don't even know how to use the TV! 
Miguel smiles. 
MIGUEL I'm making a new table for you.    It's going to be real nice. 
CARMEN I'm sure I'll love it.     Thank you. 
MIGUEL How's Erica? 
CARMEN She's good. Got a job at the factory. Just part-time, though, so she can keep up with school. 
Miguel removes the phone from his ear for a beat. 
MIGUEL And Luis? 
CARMEN He's pitching now. You should see him, Miguel, got an arm like his brother. 
MIGUEL Yeah, but can he throw a knuckle curve? 
Carmen laughs.    After a beat... 
MIGUEL I miss you, mom. But, I'm working hard. I'll be home soon. Give everyone a hug for me.

ALONE IN THE DARK 
Written by

FADE IN: 
EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 
A dense forest on a dark, misty night. 
YOUNG EDWARD CARNBY (age 10), small, thin, and terrified, runs for his life. The forest is pitch black. Young Edward ducks between trees, under branches, not stopping for anything, GASPING for breath. He doesn't turn to look behind him. He just runs as fast as he can. 
P.O.V. CREATURE: Tomething chases Young Edward through the dark forest. Its P.O.V. is skewed, inhuman. It is gaining on him. 
As Young Edward runs, beams of light become visible through the closely packed trees. Something is up ahead, something bright. Edward runs towards it. 
Young Edward bursts out into a clearing in the woods, running towards the bright light. 
P.O.V. CREATURE: 
The light stops whatever is chasing Young Edward at the edge of the forest. What is making the light isn't visible, only Young Edward's silhouette running towards the blinding light. 
EXT. FOREST - LATER THAT NIGHT 1A                                                                    1A SUPER: 20 YEARS AGO 
The beams of a dozen flashlights cut through the mist of the dark forest. A dozen uniformed DEPUTIES move through the forest, shining their flashlights around, searching. 
The trees tower over them. A low fog hangs in the air. The flashlight beams can barely penetrate it. 
EXT. ORPHANAGE - NIGHT                                           2 
A large and stately old house stands on the edge of town. A small, dense forest stretches out behind it. 
The sign on the front reads: OUR LADY OF PERPETUAL LIGHT ORPHANAGE. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Several patrol cars are parked along the Orphanage's gravel driveway. DEPUTIES mill around the front lawn. 
Another patrol car pulls up. Out of it steps the SHERIFF (late 40s). DEPUTY ADAMS (mid-30s) approaches him. 
SHERIFF What's going on, Adams? 
DEPUTY ADAMS Twenty kids live at this orphanage, Sheriff. All twenty have gone missing. 
SISTER CLARA (mid-40s), an anxious-looking nun, stands on the front porch, wrapped in a shawl. She speaks with two DEPUTIES. The Sheriff walks up and listens in. 
SISTER CLARA After the power went out, I went to check on the children. But their beds were empty. Every one of them. They just disappeared... 
EXT. FOREST - LATER The Deputies sweep through the forest with their flashlights. The trees are close together, blocking out the moonlight. A thick mist hangs in the trees. 
As Deputy Adams moves through the forest, he sees a bright light streaming through the trees up ahead. 
EXT. FOREST CLEARING 3A                                                                   3A Deputy Adams comes through the trees and emerges into a clearing in the woods. 
He sees a Shed in the clearing up ahead. A bright light is posted over the Shed's front entrance. EXT. SHED - MOMENTS LATER                                        4 Deputy Adams shines his flashlight around the outside of the Shed. 
He sees that the door is open just a crack. On the door is a sign marked: DANGER, along with the symbol for ELECTRICITY. 
INT. SHED - MOMENTS LATER Deputy Adams enters the Shed. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The Shed is small, packed with electrical equipment, power cables, and various implements for repairing power lines. 
Deputy Adams sweeps through the Shed with his flashlight. 
He approaches a large transformer module that sits at the back of the Shed. It HUMS and CRACKLES with electricity. 
There's a LOW SHUFFLING sound. Deputy Adams stops. 
He carefully peers around behind the transformer. The space is too small for a full-size person. 
But sitting on the ground behind the transformer is Young Edward. He clutches himself, shivering, frightened. 
EXT. ORPHANAGE The Sheriff stands with his Deputies. His walkie-talkie CRACKLES to life. 
DEPUTY ADAMS (ON THE WALKIE-TALKIE) Sheriff! I found one! White, male, about ten years old. Looks to be unharmed. He's in a utility shed maybe half a mile from the orphanage. 
CABBIE Get the fuck outta here! 
Beat. 
CABBIE (CONT'D) What does that mean exactly? 
CARNBY I'm an effective solution to unusual problems. 
Carnby turns to look out the back windshield. Pinkerton's taxi is still following from a few cars back. 
CARNBY (CONT'D) Speaking of which, that taxi's been following us since the airport. 
CABBIE No shit? Want me to lose him? 
CARNBY If you can... 
The Cabbie GUNS the motor and speeds off. 
13CC EXT. CITY STREETS                                            13CC Carnby's taxi accelerates down the street, pulling away from Pinkerton's taxi. 
As soon as it's evident that they are on to him, Pinkerton's taxi speeds up to give chase. 
The two taxis rocket down the streets, swerving past cars, SCREECHING around corners. 
Carnby's taxi speeds down the streets, narrowly avoiding collisions with other cars and PEDESTRIANS. 
Pinkerton just plows through whatever's in his way, SMASHING past other cars, forcing Pedestrians to jump out of the way. 
Pinkerton accelerates and tries to force Carnby's taxi off the road. The taxi's GRIND against one another. 
Carnby's taxi SCREECHES around a corner, speeding into a side street that leads to the Market Street. 
EXT. MARKET STREET 13D                                                                    13D A busy street crowded with PEDESTRIANS, open shops, and produce stalls. 
Carnby's taxi races down the busy Market Street, followed by Pinkerton. 
They swerve and SCREECH down the Street, cutting off other cars, and narrowly avoiding Pedestrians. 
But then Pinkerton's taxi ZOOMS up beside Carnby's taxi and BUMPS into it with a GRINDING CRUSH of metal. 
Not stopping, Pinkerton's taxi continues to GRIND into Carnby's taxi. The momentum pushes Carnby's taxi around sideways. 
Pinkerton's taxi then SLAMS Carnby's sideways taxi into a parked car with a CRUSH of metal and SHATTERING glass. 
There's a moment as Carnby, trapped inside the CRUSHED taxi and Pinkerton, flooring the accelerator to add more pressure, exchange a look. Pinkerton's expression is fierce. 
Pinkerton gears the taxi into reverse, backing up in order to smash into Carnby's taxi again. 
The Cabbie is trapped by the crushed front of the taxi. His face is covered with a spiderweb of deep cuts. The Cabbie struggles to get loose. 
CABBIE I'm trapped, man! 
CARNBY I'll draw him away... 
As Pinkerton's taxi backs up, it CRASHES into a Van driving by, knocking it over onto its side and spilling the contents of the Van onto the street. 
This gives Carnby the brief moment he needs to extract himself from the crushed taxi. He wrenches himself out the window, just in time to see Pinkerton's taxi accelerating towards him. 
Carnby bolts away from the crushed taxi and the trapped Cabbie. 
Pinkerton immediately swerves his taxi, aiming it right for the running Carnby. Pinkerton's taxi rockets towards him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Carnby leaps out of the way as Pinkerton's taxi CRASHES into the side of a Building, narrowly missing him. Pinkerton's taxi is CRUMPLED in a CRASH of metal and glass. 
Carnby narrowly avoids being crushed between the taxi and the building. With fluid grace, Carnby rolls to safety, landing on his feet. With a quick look back over his shoulder at Pinkerton in his crumpled taxi, Carnby runs. 
Pinkerton steps out of his taxi, seemingly unhurt by the crash. He looks around, but can't see Carnby anywhere on the street. 
Pinkerton runs for an iron-wrought staircase that leads up to a Pedestrian Bridge that hangs over the Street. 
At the top of the Pedestrian Bridge, Pinkerton looks up and down the street. 
He spots Carnby, running through the crowd of Pedestrians. 
Pinkerton leaps off the Pedestrian Bridge, arcing through the air with superhuman force. 
Pinkerton TACKLES the running Carnby to the ground, SLAMMING into him with a tremendous impact. 
But Carnby is quick. He takes the hit and spins Pinkerton around with a martial-arts kick. The kick sends Pinkerton CRASHING through the front window of a Bakery. 
The computer runs an analysis of the symbols carved into the artifact. The symbols flash by. The computer BEEPS, ready. It has isolated the origins of the symbols. They are ABKANI.

CONTINUED: 
Carnby looks over at a photo tacked to the corkboard next to the work station. The photo is of Carnby and Aline. 
INT. MUSEUM/ALINE'S OFFICE 26B                                                                    26B The Office is cluttered with books, maps, diagrams, and strange artifacts. Along one wall are several ceiling-high shelving units, each containing rows of drawers. The drawers hold artifacts from the Museum's collection. 
Aline inspects the stone tablet. She speaks into a tape recorder, like a coroner recording an autopsy. 
ALINE The pictograms are late-period Abkani. It seems to be some sort of... prophecy. Shadows that make ghosts of men. The world of light consumed by darkness. This is the first indication I've ever seen that the Abkani had a myth about the end of the world. 
EXT. SHIP DECK 26C                                                                    26C Captain Chernick approaches Hudgens at the container. The First Mate and Crewman Barnes stand quietly behind them. 
CAPTAIN CHERNICK If the container's made of gold, whatever's inside must be worth a fortune. 
HUDGENS You have no idea... 
Chernick pulls out a pistol. 
CAPTAIN CHERNICK But I'm looking forward to finding out. 
Chernick smacks Hudgens across the face with his pistol. Hudgens gives Chernick a grim look. 
HUDGENS I suppose one should not be surprised when mercenaries act mercenary. 
rewman Barnes grabs Hudgens and twists his arms behind his back, incapacitating him. The First Mate pulls out a revolver and points it right at Hudgens' face. 
Captain Chernick wedges a crowbar into the container's lock. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HUDGENS (CONT'D) You're making a terrible mistake. 
CAPTAIN CHERNICK The only mistake would be letting you walk out with whatever's in there. Barnes... 
Crewman Barnes SMASHES Hudgens' head against the container. Hudgens is dazed from the blow. 
CAPTAIN CHERNICK (CONT'D) Throw him in there. 
Crewman Barnes throws the dazed Hudgens into a Storage Room built onto the Deck. He slams the thick metal door closed. The door has a small, glass-covered peephole built into it. 
Chernick pries open the lock with the crowbar. Chernick hands the First Mate the crowbar and he jams it into the handle of the door, wedging it closed. 
INT. SHIP STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS Hudgens struggles to his feet. He BANGS on the door, trying to pull it open. 
HUDGENS Captain! Don't open it! 
EXT. SHIP DECK - CONTINUOUS The First Mate and Crewman Barnes watch in fasciation as Captain Chernick prepares to open the gold container. C APTAIN CHERNICK Let's see what all the fuss is about... 
He opens the container. 
With a deep SIGH, the vacuum of dry air escapes. 
INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - AT THAT MOMENT Carnby sits in front of his computer. He scans through screens of information relating to Abkani civilization. 
Carnby suddenly winces in intense pain. He clutches his head, staggering to his feet. He knocks over a desk lamp and a chair as he stumbles back. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Grabbing his head and trying to shake off the pain, Carnby collapses unconscious to the floor. He is out cold. 
On the work station, the lynchpin artifact starts to glow. 
INT. JOHN'S HOUSE/BEDROOM - AT THAT MOMENT JOHN HOUGHTON (early 30s) lies asleep in his bed next to his wife, LINDA HOUGHTON (early 30s). 
Suddenly, John opens his eyes. 
John quietly sits up and gets out of bed. Linda is woken up, but just barely. John walks out of the room. 
LINDA John? 
Linda rolls over and falls back asleep. 
EXT. JOHN'S HOUSE - NIGHT John exits the house. He walks down the front path and out into the night. 
INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - AT THAT MOMENT Carnby lies unconscious on the floor.

INT. SHIP DECK - CONTINUOUS 
Hudgens steps out of the Storage Room. He looks around the Deck. Mist blows in off the water. The night is quiet. 
Bodies lie everywhere, Captain Chernick, the First Mate, Crewman Barnes, the other Crewmen. Their weapons lie next to their slashed, ripped open bodies. 
Bullet holes are pocked around the Deck. Streaks of blood are smeared everywhere. Shell casings and corpses are all that remain of the battle. 
Tense, carefully looking around, Hudgens walks up to the empty gold container. 
He reaches into it, pressing a concealed panel at the back of the container. 
The panel opens, revealing a small artifact. The artifact is a thin hollow cylinder with a thick little protrusion on one end. It is covered in Abkani symbols. 
Hudgens takes out the artifact. He turns it around in his hand. He looks pleased. 
SCENE 47 OMITTED 
INT. BUREAU 713/HALLWAY - NIGHT Everything in Bureau 713's Headquarters looks sleek and high- tech. There are no windows anywhere. 
COMMANDER BURKE (late 30s) strides purposefully down the hallway. He is confident to the point of arrogance. 
His second-in-command, AGENT MILES (mid-30s), driven and efficient, hurries to keep up. 
BURKE his better be good, Miles. 
AGENT MILES Sir, we're getting some strange readings in the control room. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BURKE his is Bureau 713. "Strange" doesn't even crack my radar. Now what's the situation? 
AGENT MILES Well, sir, normal levels of paranormal activity range from three to five... 
BURKE condescending) Yes Miles. And what level are the sensors picking up now? 
Burke and Miles arrive at the Control Room. Burke nods to two BUREAU GUARDS standing at the entrance. 
AGENT MILES We don't know. 
Burke stops and looks at Agent Miles for the first time. 
AGENT MILES (CONT'D) They only go up to 50. 
Agent Miles opens the door to the Control Room. INT. BUREAU 713 HEADQUARTERS/CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS Inside the Control Room, the banks of monitors and sensors are all lit up. Streams of data flow across the monitors. 
Burke and Miles stand at the doorway. 
AGENT "KRASH" KRASHINSKY (mid-30s), a cool and collected female tech-geek, scans through data on the monitors. She always wears a headset. 
BURKE What are we looking at, Krashinsky? 
KRASH Electromagnetics off the scale, Commander. 
AGENT YONEK, a Control Room techie, adjusts the sensors. 
AGENT YONEK Recalibrating sensors now, sir. 
Burke looks concerned for the first time. 
INT. ORPHANAGE/DEN - NIGHT   - TWENTY YEARS AGO Young Edward (age 10) walks through the Den. The lights are all out. The Den is musty, but clean. 
A sliver of light glows from underneath the doorway to Sister Clara's bedroom. Young Edward KNOCKS softly on the door. 
Sister Clara opens the door. She wears her nightgown. 
SISTER CLARA Still having trouble sleeping, Edward? You can't stay up all night, you know. 
YOUNG EDWARD Sister, something's happened. 
SISTER CLARA What is it, Edward? 
YOUNG EDWARD They're not gone anymore. The others are back. 
SCENE 51 AND 52 INCORPORATED INTO SCENE 50 INT. ORPHANAGE/CHILDREN'S ROOM - NIGHT - TWENTY YEARS AGO Sister Clara throws open the door to one of the children's bedrooms. Ten beds are lined up along the wall. All ten of them have CHILDREN asleep in them. 
On the work station is a stack of the Orphanage's worn-out old file folders. Each file matches a name on the list. 
The database finishes processing. It has found a match. A MISSING PERSON REPORT flashes onscreen. It's the final name of the list. Carnby makes a note next to the name. 
Carnby hits PRINT and the report comes out of the printer. He adds it to a small stack of similar reports. 
Each report has a photo of a missing Orphan, both MALE and FEMALE. One of the photos is of John Houghton. 
Sixteen are missing. Three are unaccounted for. 
EXT. RESTAURANT PATIO - DAY The outdoor patio of a downtown Restaurant. Carnby sits with a coffee and a cherry pie at a table for two. 
AGENT PAUL FISCHER (mid-50s), precise but friendly, approaches the table and sits down across from Carnby. 
FISCHER Why did I agree to this? 
A WAITER walks up. He puts down a plate of pecan pie in front of Fischer. The Waiter smiles and walks away. 
CARNBY I ordered for you, Fischer. It's pecan. 
Fischer gives Carnby a smirk. 
FISCHER You've got a good memory, Carnby. 
Fischer takes a bite of the pecan pie. 
Fischer pulls out a file and slides it across the table. Carnby opens the file. Inside it are photos and reports on the three remaining Orphans from Carnby's list. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
FISCHER (CONT'D) I tracked down the three you asked about. They all disappeared last night. Same story. No suitcase. No car. Just up and walked out in the middle of the night. 
CARNBY That means all nineteen are missing. 
FISCHER I ran full cross-references. Nothing much in common between them. Except they all grew up in the same orphanage. Your orphanage. What's going on, Carnby? 
CARNBY That's what I'm trying to find out. 
Carnby gets up to leave. He picks up the file. 
CARNBY (CONT'D) Thanks Fischer. It's good to know I've still got friends at 713. 
SCENE 59 OMITTED 
EXT. MUSEUM - DUSK As the sun sets, the streetlights around the Museum all come on in unison, bathing the area in a warm glow. 
The lights are all on in the Museum. 
INT. MUSEUM/ALINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT Aline sits at her desk, notes spread out in front of her. The notes show various Abkani symbols. She writes down comments in the margins. 
The phone RINGS. Aline answers it. 
ALINE Hello? 
HUDGENS (ON THE PHONE) Did a shipment arrive for me today? 
ALINE It's a fascinating piece, Dr. Hudgens. I started decoding the pictograms and... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HUDGENS (ON THE PHONE) (interrupting) Who told you to do that? That crate was not to be opened. 
ALINE I was only going to catalogue it for you. 
HUDGENS (ON THE PHONE) It's not your place to question my instructions, Ms. Cedrac. Leave the tablet alone. I'll catalogue it myself when I get back. 
ALINE But, Dr. Hudgens, I was just... 
But Hudgens has already hung up. Aline looks at the receiver, frustrated. She hangs up the phone. 
She looks up, tilting her head to hear FOOTSTEPS approaching. 
The Guard KNOCKS on the open door. 
GUARD There's... somebody here to see you. 
INT. MUSEUM/MAIN HALL - DUSK Aline exits quickly out of a service door, looking anxious. The Guard scurries after her. 
Carnby stands in front of the Security Desk. 
INT. MUSEUM/MAIN HALL The lights flicker. Large shadows are cast through the area by the remaining, dim lights. 
The Guard sits at the Security Desk, talking on the phone. The security monitors are all out. G UARD (INTO PHONE) I don't care if nothing's wrong with the grid. Something's definitely wrong with our power. Get someone down here, pronto. 
The Guard hangs up the phone. 
There's a WHOOSH of movement behind him. The Guard turns to the sound. Silence. 
He flicks on his flashlight, shining the beam into the dark corners of the area. Nothing is there. 
Something CLATTERS in another room. The Guard quickly turns to the sound of the movement. 
INT. MUSEUM/HALLWAY 65A                                                                    65A Carnby and Aline walk down the Hallway. Framed art hangs from the walls. Small sculptures sit on pedestals along the way. 
The overhead lights in the Hallway emit only a low glow, flickering sporadically. 
Aline leads the way with a flashlight. They come up to a door to a second Hallway. 
The hairs on the back of Carnby's neck rise up. He touches the back of his neck, spooked. Aline notices. 
ALINE What is it? 
CARNBY Hairs on the back of my neck just stood up. 
Aline gets it. 
Carnby pulls out his PARA-METER. It's an old, battered device. The display lights up as Carnby turns it on. The para- meter immediately picks up some readings. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ALINE How come every time you show up, my life gets complicated? 
CARNBY I could ask you the same thing. 
Carnby listens at the door. Carnby nods to Aline as he opens the door. Nothing is there. 
65B                                                                    65B INT. MUSEUM/CERAMICS ROOM 
The Guard enters the Ceramics Room. The overhead lights give off only low glows, flickering sporadically. 
The display cases and large sculptures give off long shadows. 
The Guard walks through the room, shining his flashlight around. He can't see anything out of the ordinary. 
A WHOOSH of movement slips past the Guard. He turns quickly. Nothing. 
He shines his flashlight around, looking for anything out of the ordinary. He stands with his back to a display case. 
From out of the shadows behind the display case, a long, segmented tail emerges. 
The tail is covered in hard, dark scales. At the end of the tail is a sharp spike. 
The tail suddenly flicks at the Guard, piercing him through the back of the head and out his mouth. The tail's spike glistens with fresh blood. 
The Guard's flashlight CLATTERS to the floor. The bulb BREAKS. 
The tail withdraws from the Guard. The Guard's body falls to the ground, dead. 
INT. MUSEUM/HALLWAY 2 65C                                                                    65C Aline leads the way with the flashlight, followed by Carnby. The Hallway is only faintly lit. 
From up ahead, they hear a CLATTERING sound. 
Carnby reaches into his holster and pulls out his revolver. Aline hands him the flashlight without a word.

SCENES 66 TO 68 OMITTED 
INT. MUSEUM/CERAMICS ROOM Aline and Carnby quietly come out a service door that leads to the Ceramics Room. They conceal themselves behind a pair of columns, scanning the area before they step out. 
The lights are dim, with long shadows stretching out through the area. 
Aline is about to speak, but Carnby puts a finger to his mouth and shakes his head, no. 
The dead body of the Guard lies in a pool of blood on the ground. There seems to be no one else around. 
But then, silently, moving with a fluid grace, a XENOMORPH CREATURE emerges out of the shadows. 
The xenomorph creature is huge, terrifying. It is seven feet tall, covered in thick, dark scales. It stands on two legs, with long, powerful arms that end in razor-sharp claws and a segmented, spiked tail poised behind it. 
Carnby reloads his revolver. He has it ready. 
But then the CRASHING stops. Aline and Carnby listen. Everything is quiet. 
The sound of HELICOPTERS can be faintly heard in the distance. 
Carnby listens against the door. 
ALINE (CONT'D) What do you think? 
Carnby nods to her. Aline unlocks the door. 
INT. MUSEUM/HALLWAY 2 - CONTINUOUS 
Carnby steps out of the Storage Room, revolver ready. The Hallway is empty. 
Aline steps out behind him. She motions to the double-doors at the end of the Hallway. 
ALINE Those doors lead to the front entrance. 
Carnby hands Aline the flashlight. He grips his revolver. 
Carnby and Aline move down the Hallway towards the double- doors. As they move, they listen intently. The only thing they can hear is the sound of their FOOTSTEPS. 
SCENES 69D To 69G OMITTED 
SCENE 69H NOW SCENE 69C 
SCENES 70 TO 82 OMITTED 
INT. MUSEUM/MAIN HALL Aline and Carnby quietly open the double-doors leading into the Main Hall. 
The lights are dim. Moonlight streams in through the skylight above them. 
Aline shines the flashlight around. She hears a WHOOSH of movement behind her and shines the flashlight towards it. 
The sound of a quickly approaching HELICOPTER can be heard in the distance. 
The double-doors BURST open as an invisible creature SMASHES through them. 
It chases after them, knocking everything in its path out of the way 
Carnby and Aline run. 
Up ahead of them, the second invisible creature comes CRASHING through the display cases, heading right for them. 
Carnby and Aline are trapped between the two invisible creatures. They have nowhere to run. 
The sound of a HELICOPTER rises up overhead. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Suddenly, powerful spotlights switch on, shining bright blue beams through the skylight. Another set of spotlight beams shine through the high windows lining the Main Hall. 
EXT. MUSEUM - CONTINUOUS 
A sleek black Bureau 713 helicopter hovers over the building. A pair of spotlights shine beams down through the skylight. 
INT. MUSEUM/MAIN HALL - CONTINUOUS In a hail of shattered glass, AGENTS BARR (male), CHEUNG (female), and MARKO (male) burst through the skylight, rappelling down on zip-lines from the hovering helicopter. 
They each carry a sleek, high-tech assault rifle with a lamp mounted on the top. They all wear full Bureau 713 combat gear, body armor with a headset comm-link and a helmet with a dark visor mounted on it. 
The creatures HISS in reaction and scramble out of the spotlights from the helicopter. 
The Agents immediately open FIRE. Their bullets glow with a pulse of yellow light as they streak through the air. 
All Carnby and Aline can see is the Agents shooting glowing bullets into the unnaturally long shadows. 
But the SQUEAL of one of the creatures shows that the Agents' bullets have found their target. 
As the glowing bullets hit the creature, it momentarily flashes visible, then invisible again. 
The two invisible creatures scatter, slipping away into the shadows. 
The Agents cut their zip-lines, dropping to the ground. 
As they land, they all flip on their rifle-mounted lamps. The bright blue beams cut through the darkness. 
Their movements are precise, controlled. They all have their rifles out, scanning the area. 
Agent Barr has a high-tech scanning device attached to his rifle. It is an updated version of Carnby's para-meter that monitors the electromagnetic energy in the vicinity. It is used to detect the presence of the xenomorph creatures. 
CARNBY I'll catch up. 
Agent Miles escorts Aline out of the Museum. 
Burke and Carnby regard one another. 
BURKE Why am I still looking at you? 
CARNBY I need to know what those things are. 
BURKE That information's classified. If you were still an agent, you'd already know. But since you're not, stay out of my way. 
Burke turns to stride away. Carnby grabs his arm. Burke turns back, annoyed. 
CARNBY I'm asking nicely. 
Burke grabs Carnby's arm, trying to twist it away. But Carnby's fast enough to slip out of Burke's hold. 
Now angry, Burke grabs Carnby by the collar, shoving him against a stone column. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
But Carnby deftly twists out of Burke's grip and shoves him up against the same stone column. 
In the struggle, Carnby's hand flicks into Burke's pocket. 
Agent Barr intervenes, pulling Carnby away. Burke straightens himself out, trying not to look rattled. 
BURKE Get him out of here! 
Carnby shrugs off Agent Barr and walks away. 
CARNBY You're right, Commander. I guess I have gone soft. 
As Carnby walks off, he looks down in his hand. He has lifted Burke's I-D card out of his pocket.

SCENE 90 NOW SCENE 91A 
EXT. MUSEUM - LATER The front of the Museum has been completely blocked off. There is lots of activity, as BUREAU AGENTS mill around. 
Aline sits in the back of a 713 Emergency Medical Vehicle. A 713 MEDIC finishes dressing the cuts on her arm. 
Carnby approaches her. Aline nods to the Medic and gets up to join Carnby. They speak quietly. 
ALINE I want to finish studying those artifacts. 
CARNBY I need to find out what's happened to John and the others. Stay in contact. We'll meet up later. 
INT. MUSEUM/MAIN HALL 91A                                                                    91A Burke oversees a team of AGENTS in biohazard suits as they sweep the scene, running scans of the area on high-tech hand- held devices. Photos are snapped by another AGENT. 
Agent Miles escorts Aline over to Burke. Burke is distracted by the scanning device he is holding. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ALINE Commander, I need to get to my office. 
BURKE The museum's quarantined until we're done. 
ALINE At least let me pack up my work. There's priceless artifacts in there. If they get damaged... 
Burke looks up at Aline. He gives a minute nod to Miles. 
BURKE If you notice anything out of the ordinary, let me know immediately. 
Aline looks around at the Agents scanning the destruction caused by the creatures. 
ALINE I don't think I want to know your definition of out of the ordinary. 
SCENE 91B IS NOW SCENE 103A 
SCENES 92 TO 102 OMITTED 
INT. FISCHER'S LAB - NIGHT The Lab is full of sleek, high-tech lab equipment and state of the art computers. The room is lit with a HUMMING fluorescent light. Surgical equipment and various pieces of high-tech machinery BUZZ by an autopsy slab. Surgical tools are laid out on a table. 
Pinkerton's body is laid out on the slab, face-down. 
Fischer stands over Pinkerton's body. He holds a high-tech hand-held scanning device. The scanner is connected to a large monitor on a dolly next to the slab. 
AGENT MILES (CONT'D) Commander Burke wants to see you. 
116A INT. HUDGENS' LABORATORY                                          116A 
Hudgens walks through a dank cement room. Various pieces of scientific equipment sit in a corner. Shelves are lined with ancient artifacts, small sculptures, and masks. 
Hudgens stops at a work station and pauses. A look of pain crosses his face. He winces, holding it in. He steadies himself. 
At the other side of the Lab is a large recess in the space. The opening is covered by thick cage bars covered in gold. The cage appears to be empty. 
But suddenly, an invisible creature SLAMS into the bars of the cage, trying to lunge at Hudgens. 
As it hits the bars, fingers of electricity jolt through it, making it visible for a split second. 
Hudgens watches calmly. He goes to a small dial built into the wall beside the cage. Hudgens turns up the dial. 
In the cage, jagged bolts of electricity jolt around the invisible creature. It SQUEALS and HISSES from the electricity. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Finally, the creature collapses and fades visible. The creature is unconscious, but still alive. 
Hudgens turns the dial back down. 
Hudgens picks up a hypodermic syringe from a counter next to the cage. 
He injects the syringe into the creature's neck, between two of its scales. He withdraws a syringe-full of the creature's black, sticky blood. 
He goes back to the work station, rolling up the sleeve of his shirt. His arm is pocked with injection marks. 
Hudgens ties off his arm, preps a vein, and injects himself with the syringe of creature's blood. He closes his eyes, feeling the substance flow into him. 
SCENE 116B NOW SCENE 119B 
EXT. CARNBY'S BUILDING - DAY Aline walks up to an imposing, slightly decrepit-looking old brick building in a bad area of town. 
She goes to press the buzzer, but the box is broken, the wires limply hanging out. 
She KNOCKS on the door. No answer. 
She stops, annoyed. But then a slight, involuntary smile comes across her face. 
Aline fishes in her purse and pulls out a set of keys. She finds the key she's looking for and slips it into the lock on the front door. 
She pauses for a moment, then turns the key. 
SCENE 118 OMITTED 
INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - CONTINUOUS Aline enters the Loft. She looks around. 
LINE Edward? 
Aline closes the door behind her. She takes another few steps into the Loft. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She spots Carnby's discarded trench-coat on the floor. She walks up and picks it up with two fingers. 
ALINE (CONT'D) I see nothing's changed... 
Aline hangs the coat on a hook. She enters the Loft proper, looking around. 
ALINE (CONT'D) Edward? 
Aline stops. She sees Carnby lying on his bed, asleep. She smiles. He looks peaceful. 
Aline sees the lynchpin artifact sitting in the lab area. She unpacks her bag, taking out three items wrapped in cloth. She places the three items next to the lynchpin artifact. 
She looks over at Carnby, sleeping in his bed. 
Aline kicks off her shoes and walks over to the bed. 
She climbs onto the bed, careful not to disturb Carnby. He stirs a little, but he doesn't wake up. Aline lies down next to Carnby on the bed. She notices the new scars and bruises along his back. 
Aline lays her head on a pillow. Their faces lie close together. She watches Carnby sleep. 
Aline leans over and gives Carnby the lightest of kisses. He doesn't wake up. 
ALINE (CONT'D) Sweet dreams... 
Fischer is PUNCHED in the face, hard. He is stunned. 
Fischer is hurled over the couch. He lands heavily on a glass coffee table, SHATTERING the glass tabletop. 
The impact knocks his revolver out of his hands. 
Fischer lies dazed in the broken glass. He looks up at his attacker. 
It's Hudgens, standing over him. 
Hudgens SLAMS his fist into Fischer's face. Fischer is now only semi-conscious. 
Hudgens pulls out a long, thin spinal-worm. Its many clawed feet and razor-sharp jaws snap away, its segmented, scaled body writhing in his grip. 
HUDGENS If you can't beat us, Fischer, join us. 
Hudgens grabs Fischer by his hair and pulls his head back, forcing his mouth open. 
CUT TO: 
We follow the spinal-worm as it enters Fischer's mouth, slipping down his throat. 
We continue to follow the spinal-worm as it makes its way through Fischer's body, weaving through the twists and turns of his digestive system and internal organs. 
The spinal-worm tears through layers of Fischer's insides, finally making its way to his spine. The spinal-worm then wraps itself around Fischer's spine, its tiny clawed feet grabbing hold and attaching themselves along its length. 
We move up Fischer's spinal cord to his brain. The spinal- worm seems to be causing synapses to fire in chaotic bursts. We travel through Fischer's brain and out of his eyes. 
CUT TO: 
Fischer's expression is now calm. Hudgens regards Fischer, looking pleased with himself. 
119H INT. FOREST - NIGHT - TWENTY YEARS AGO                        119H P.O.V. CREATURE: 
Something chases Young Edward as he runs for his life through the misty, dark forest. He runs towards a light up ahead. 
SCENE 119I OMITTED 
119J INT. SHED - NIGHT - TWENTY YEARS AGO                          119J Young Edward enters the Shed, closing the door behind him. 
The small Shed is cluttered with equipment for repairing power lines. A large transformer module sits at the back of the Shed. It HUMS and CRACKLES with electricity. 
Something compels Young Edward to move closer towards the transformer and reach out a trembling hand. He places his hand against the transformer's front grill. 
With a sudden SNAP and FLASH, electricity courses through Young Edward. Jagged fingers of blue light jolt around him. 
SCENES 120 TO 123 OMITTED 
INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - NIGHT It's night. The Loft is dark. Carnby and Aline are fast asleep on the bed, lying next to one another. 
Carnby wakes up with a start. He tries to get his bearings. Carnby looks surprised to see Aline lying next to him. 
He quietly gets out of bed, letting her sleep. He pulls on a fresh shirt. 
Carnby pads over to the lab area and turns on a desk light. He sees the wrapped items Aline placed on his work station. 
Carnby unwraps the items. They are the three Abkani artifacts from the Museum. 
Carnby picks up the lynchpin artifact, turning it around. Something catches his eye. Carnby fiddles with the artifact. 
Suddenly, the artifact telescopes out. Instead of one thick ring, it is now three successively smaller rings, one piled on the other, with a common hollow middle. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Carnby picks up the large ring artifact. He slots it into place on the telescoped lynchpin artifact. Next, Carnby slots in the medium and small rings into place. 
The four pieces fit together perfectly, creating a cylindrical device with a small, round opening in the bottom. 
INT. CARNBY'S LOFT - LATER 
Carnby cooks omelettes in the Kitchen area of the Loft. The ingredients are spread out on the counter. 
Aline wakes up. She sits up in the bed and looks around. 
ALINE Something smells amazing. 
Aline trots over to the Kitchen area as Carnby serves up the omelettes. Aline gives him a look. 
ALINE (CONT'D) I love omelettes. 
CARNBY I know. 
The Female Orphans jumps away, into the shadows. Aline scrambles to her feet, the revolver ready. But the Female Orphans has disappeared. 
Aline runs over to Carnby. He grabs a shotgun from the weapons cabinet and loads it. 
ALINE That looked like John. 
CARNBY It is. The other two are from the orphanage as well. 
Carnby pumps the shotgun. Carnby and Aline creep forward into the darkness of the Loft. They listen. 
Suddenly, John lunges at him, his teeth bared. 
Carnby SMASHES John across the head with the shotgun. But John keeps coming, SLAMMING him against the wall. Carnby breaks John's hold and swivel-kicks him out of the way. John skitters off into the shadows. 
The Female Orphan leaps out at Aline, trying to tear into her with her teeth. 
Carnby grabs a pipe leaning against the wall and runs for Aline. 
The Male Orphan lunges out at Carnby. He SMASHES the Male Orphan across the face with the pipe. 
Aline struggles with the Female Orphan. Carnby turns to see John rising up behind her, about to strike. C arnby reacts instinctively. He FIRES, shooting John in the chest with a shotgun BLAST. John flails back, dead. 
The Male Orphan jumps out at Carnby. Now working on instinct, Carnby spins and jams the pipe into his gut, impaling him. The Male Orphan stumbles to the ground and dies. 
Aline gets away from the Female Orphan. As the Female Orphan lunges at her again, Aline FIRES, shooting her three times in the chest. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
But it's only the third bullet, the one that hits the Female Orphan dead center in the chest that takes her down. The Female Orphan falls back, dead. 
Aline comes up to Carnby. He stands over John's corpse. 
ALINE You had no choice. 
CARNBY Something's controlling them. 
ALINE How many are there altogether? 
CARNBY Twenty. Including me. 
The para-meter starts BEEPING again, louder and more frenetic. The lights start to flicker, fading up and down. 
Carnby unzips the duffle-bag. It's full of 713 equipment given to him by Fischer. Carnby loads an assault rifle with 713 magazines. He loads a pistol with the glowing bullets. 
Carnby throws Aline the pistol. She catches it in mid-air. She checks it like a pro. 
Aline and Carnby stand together, guns drawn, ready. 
There's a moment of quiet. They listen. 
The lights in the Loft flicker. The scanner BEEPS. 
Something SMASHES into the Loft's front door. 
Carnby grabs the para-meter. It BEEPS more insistently. 
The front door BURSTS open, knocked right off its hinges by the invisible creature crashing through it. 
P.O.V. CREATURE: 
The invisible xenomorph creature's skewed, inhuman P.O.V. as it looks across the Loft, searching. It locates Carnby and Aline and heads directly for them. A ll that is visible of the creature's trajectory is furniture being knocked aside as the creature rushes towards them. 
The creature SMASHES right through a glass-topped work table, SHATTERING it. Papers whirl around in its wake. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
Aline and Carnby stand their ground, facing the on-coming creature as it lunges towards them. 
Carnby and Aline leap out of the way at the last moment. Rolling away in opposite directions, they simultaneously OPEN FIRE. Their glowing bullets hit the creature dead on. 
The creature SQUEALS, flashing visible from the multiple impacts. Their glowing bullets pierce the creature and it tumbles to the ground, dead. 
The creature's invisible corpse lies motionless. Broken furniture and shattered glass is everywhere. 
Carnby's para-meter is quiet, the readings subsiding with the creature's death. The lights stop flickering. 
CARNBY (CONT'D) We'd better get out of here. 
Suddenly, all the lights in the Loft go out in unison. All the computer monitors also go dark. 
The last creature goes down in a hail of glowing bullets. The Agents strafe the creature's corpse to make sure it's dead. 
Agent Barr and Carnby exchange a look between them. Barr clearly respects Carnby's abilities. 
The Loft is still dark. Barr's rifle-mounted scanner no longer registers any creatures. 
AGENT BARR We're clear, sir. 
Burke looks around at the remains of the battle. The Loft is totally trashed. A small fire burns in the Upper Level. 
BURKE Love what you've done with the place, Carnby. 
Miles runs a hand-held scanning device over John's corpse. The scanner BEEPS, indicating the presence of a spinal-worm. 
AGENT MILES Sir, this one's infected too! 
Agent Turner scans the Female Orphan's corpse. His scanning device BEEPS. She has a spinal-worm too. 
AGENT TURNER Got another one here! 
Burke immediately turns his weapon to Carnby. The red laser- sight makes a glowing dot on Carnby's chest. 
Taking their cue from Burke, the other Agents in his unit all train their weapons on Carnby. Several glowing red dots hover on his chest. 
BURKE Drop your weapon and get down on the ground. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
ALINE What are you doing? 
BURKE He's been infected with some kind of organism. He could be under its control. 
Aline turns to Carnby. 
CARNBY It's true. I've got one inside me. But it's not controlling me. 
BURKE You'll excuse me if I don't take your word for it. Now drop your weapon. 
Carnby holds his weapon at his side. He doesn't drop it. But he doesn't move either. 
Aline steps in between Carnby and the Agents. The red dots are now trained on her chest. 
AGENT TURNER Get out of the way! 
The Agents try to get a clear shot around Aline. 
ALINE He's not one of them. 
URKE If I've got to shoot through you to get to him, I'll do it. 
Carnby looks up at the lights. They are still dark. 
CARNBY Why are the lights still out? 
Barr consults his scanner. It isn't registering anything. 
AGENT BARR Scanner's clear. 
AGENT MILES (INTO COMM-LINK) Krash? 
KRASH (ON THE COMM-LINK) Negative. 
(CONTINUED) 
67A. CONTINUED: (4) 
BURKE Forget to pay your power bill, Carnby? 
An Agent standing at the other end of the Loft hears something SHUFFLING behind him. He turns to look. 
Something grabs the Agent, SLAMS him back against the wall, and rips out his neck. 
It's another ORPHAN, with the same fierce, gaunt look and clear irises. 
Burke turns away from Carnby for a moment, trying to figure out what's happening. 
Carnby suddenly lifts his weapon and points it at Burke. Burke sees this, but before he can react, Carnby FIRES. 
Carnby's bullet WHIZZES past Burke and hits an ORPHAN dead center in the gut, sending him flailing back, dead. The Orphan was about to pounce on Burke. 
There's a moment as Burke and Carnby look at one another. Burke realizes Carnby just saved his life. 
rash swivels in her chair, processing data, making adjustments to sensors, and checking out the information scrolling across the bank of monitors. She wears a head-set. 
KRASH We're practically off the scale, Commander. This is unprecedented. Should I initiate Contingency Nine-Alpha? 
BURKE (ON THE COMM-LINK) The military? We don't have time to wait for them to mobilize. 
KRASH Is that a negative, Commander? 
134B EXT. MINE                                                     134B 
Burke leads Carnby, Aline, and Miles to the Entrance Hall. 
BURKE (INTO COMM-LINK) No. Initiate Nine-Alpha on my authority. But I won't hold my breath. By the time this clears Defense Council, we'll be dead or drinking... 
INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT Rusty construction vehicles, detritus, and rubble lie discarded throughout the Hall. Several shafts have been dug into the mountain. Narrow paths lead up the slope. 
AGENTS scurry around, setting up the defense system. The main position is set up just inside the entrance to the Hall. 
Burke and Miles enter, followed by Aline and Carnby. 
AGENT MILES We've got three perimeters of flash- mines. Gatling guns are set to electromagnetic motion tracking. And every available agent in the vicinity is here. But Commander... 
BURKE I know, Miles. But back-up won't make it before sunrise. 
Several raised Platforms stand in the middle of the Hall. 
On one Platform, Agent Turner helps two AGENTS unload a large gold-plated generator from the back of a Humvee. 
AGENT TURNER Generator will be on-line shortly, sir. 
Burke nods to Turner as he and the others walk by. Carnby and Aline get into step with Burke and Miles. 
ALINE It looks like you're going to war. 
BURKE We are. The highest xeno concentration on record is closing in on this location. This could be our chance to wipe them out once and for all. 
A Tunnel, carved directly into the rock wall of the Mine, leads off into darkness. Carnby stares down at the Tunnel. 
CARNBY We need to go down there. 
BURKE What? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CARNBY They're coming here for a reason. Until we know what they're after, we're never really going to be able to stop them. 
Agent Miles consults his hand-held para-meter. 
AGENT MILES Something's definitely down there, sir. But there's too much interference to get a clear reading from here. 
Miles looks at Burke expectantly. Carnby and Aline watch him as well. Burke looks conflicted. 
BURKE Goddamn it. Miles, you're in charge of perimeter defense. Nothing gets in or out until we find out what's down there. 
135A EXT. MINE                                                      135A Batteries of flash-mines (mines that explode with a burst of blinding light) set to electromagnetic sensors are being positioned in wide perimeters around the Entrance Hall. 
Automatic gatling guns loaded with chains of glowing bullets are set up at key points around the area. The gatling guns are mounted on swiveling robotic bases, able to automatically turn to face on-coming targets. 
AGENT FEENSTRA (mid-30s) tests the motion sensor on one of the gatling guns with her hand. The gun swivels accurately to match the movement of her hand. 
Agent Feenstra nods to the two AGENTS standing behind the gatling gun. They tinker with its guidance system. 
SCENE 136 OMITTED INT. MINE TUNNEL Carnby and Aline walk carefully down a pitch black tunnel, illuminated only by their lights. 
Along with them are Commander Burke, and Agents Barr, Cheung and Marko. They each carry assault rifles with lamps mounted on them. Their visors are down. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ALINE I've been thinking about something. The Abkani prophecy. The shadows that make ghosts of men... 
CARNBY Every culture has a story about the end of the world. 
ALINE But not every story starts to come true. 
Agent Barr carries a hand-held para-meter. It's picking up high electromagnetic readings. 
AGENT BARR It's definitely this way, sir. 
They pass by various pieces of mining equipment, long since discarded. Thick dust and cobwebs hang off the equipment. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Jagged bolts of lightning and RUMBLING THUNDER echo around them. The sound of HISSING comes up around them. 
Suddenly, one by one, creatures start fading into visibility behind them. More and more creatures appear, fading visible, until there are dozens of xenomorph creatures stretching down the mountain-side. 
Hudgens looks back at his creature army. He lets an evil smile slip across his face. 
All at once, the creatures start leaping down the mountainside. As they run, they all start fading invisible. 
INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL Dozens of Agents in full combat gear are in position. They are armed, tense, and ready. 
Suddenly, the scanner on Agent Miles' rifle starts to BEEP. At first, the BEEPS are spread apart. Then the BEEPS sound in rapid succession, faster and faster. 
AGENT MILES Incoming! 
INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL/GENERATOR PLATFORM Agent Miles runs up to Agent Turner. He is still tinkering with the generator. The spotlights are still off. 
AGENT MILES Where the hell are the lights? 
AGENT TURNER The generator's not coming on-line. They must be disrupting it. 
INT. SHAFT Burke, and Agents Barr and Cheung lower themselves down the Shaft on zip-lines. They descend quickly and smoothly. 
Carnby and Aline have to take the long way down. They carefully climb down the rungs of the ancient wooden ladder built into the Shaft. 
Carnby steps down on a weak rung and it starts to give way. When Aline steps down on it moments later, it breaks. 
line starts to fall, but Carnby is there to catch her.

As Burke descends, he speaks into his comm-link. 
AGENT MILES (ON THE COMM-LINK) We've got incoming! What are your orders? 
BURKE (INTO COMM-LINK) Hold tight, Miles. Once we retrieve Marko we're coming back up. Whatever's down here is going to have to wait. 
There is a LOW RUMBLING sound above them. 
149A INT. TUNNEL CHAMBER                                            149A 
Small rock fragments shower down into the open mouth of the Shaft. There's a CREAKING sound. 
The collapsed floor has triggered a trap. 
In the ceiling directly above the Shaft, a heavy, round stone column suddenly breaks loose. More rock fragments rain down into the Shaft. 
49B INT. SHAFT                                                     149B 
Everyone presses against the Shaft walls to avoid the falling rocks. 
The stone column drops into the Shaft with a thunderous CRASH. It fits perfectly. 
The column starts sliding down the Shaft towards them. 
SCENES 150 AND 151 INCORPORATED INTO SCENE 149 
EXT. MINE In the distance, a bright flash goes off. Then another. And another. The flashes light up the landscape. The inhuman SQUEALS of the creatures can be heard in the distance. 
The helicopters all take off, hovering up into the air above the Mine. 
152A INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL                                        152A 
Agent Miles and the Agents in position watch the horizon. Dozens of flashes go off in the distance. 
AGENT MILES (INTO COMM-LINK) They've hit the outer perimeter.

Miles' scanner is reading off the scale. It BEEPS at a frenetic pace, registering dozens of approaching creatures. 
KRASH (ON THE COMM-LINK) Electromagnetics around the mine are off the scale. 
Krash's voice starts to DISTORT with STATIC. 
AGENT MILES (INTO COMM-LINK) Krash? Report! Krash? 
BURKE (INTO COMM-LINK) (CONT'D) Krash? Are you reading me? Miles? 
AGENT MILES (ON THE COMM-LINK) Can't get through to Krash either. Too much interference. 
URKE (INTO COMM-LINK) Use the second perimeter as your firing mark. I'll be there as soon as I find a way out. 
In the sand near Barr and Cheung, something moves. 
54A INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL                                      154A 
Agent Miles and the other Agents watch the perimeter. 
AGENT MILES Hold your fire until they're at the second perimeter. 
The flash-mine detonations are now much closer. 
AGENT MILES (CONT'D) Fire! 
The Agents OPEN FIRE, letting loose a barrage of glowing bullets. Streaks of light fill the night. 
80A. 
EXT. MINE The THUNDERING GUNFIRE of the rotating gatling guns fills the air. Thousands of glowing bullets streak through the night. 
The hovering helicopters open FIRE with their side-mounted gatling guns. 
The on-rushing creatures SQUEAL and flash visible as the gatling guns cut into them with waves of glowing bullets. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
But Agent Miles' scanner continues to BEEP frenetically. More and more creatures continue to rush towards them. 
The automatic, ground-mounted gatling guns start running out of ammunition. The sound of GUNFIRE is replaced by the HIGH- PITCHED WHINE of the turbines rotating without bullets. 
The helicopters continue to lay down suppressing FIRE, but they are also running out of ammo. 
155A INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL                                       155A 
Agent Miles and the other Agents in the Hall continue to FIRE away into the night. 
HELICOPTER PILOT (ON THE COMM-LINK) Ammo running low! How many of these goddamn things are there? 
Agent Miles' scanner registers that waves of the creatures are still quickly approaching them. 
INT. SAND CHAMBER Cheung tests her injured ankle. She can walk with a limp. 
Something moves through the sand towards Aline. Carnby looks over at the last moment. 
CARNBY Aline! 
With a loud SQUEAL, a SAND WORM bursts out of the sand in front of Aline. At the end of its elongated body, a pair of snapping jaws fold out, lined with razor-sharp teeth. 
Aline scrambles back and falls down. Her rifle is out of reach. 
Another sand worm bursts out of the sand, diving for Carnby. But he is quick on the draw. He SHOOTS the sand worm before it can bite him. The bullets BLOW APART the sand worm's head. 
The sand on the Chamber floor comes alive with movement as sand worms burrow towards them. 
Agents Barr and Cheung OPEN FIRE on the sand worms. Aline fumbles for her flashlight, shining it at the sand worm. It recoils from the light and HISSES at her. The sand worm's jaws fold open, revealing its razor-sharp teeth. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The sand worm tries to dodge the light. It snaps at Aline with its jaws and lunges at her. 
She grabs it by the torso, just under the snapping jaws. The sand worm struggles, trying to bite Aline. She can barely hold it away from her. Her grip starts to loosen. 
The sand worm's snapping jaws are almost at Aline's face. She strains to hold it away. 
With the sound of a GUNSHOT, the sand worm's head explodes. It flops to one side, dead. 
Carnby stands behind it, his gun smoking from the shot. 
A sand worm bursts out and chomps down on Cheung's bad foot. She SCREAMS. 
Barr SHOOTS the worm that bit Cheung. Cheung falls back, her body seizing up from its poisonous bite. 
Cheung's body contorts. Barr grabs her as Cheung's head reels back and her body goes limp. She's dead. 
Burke turns, his face grim. He OPENS FIRE on the sand worms. With precision and intensity, he FIRES controlled bursts at any movement under the sand. 
(CONTINUED)

The grenades all EXPLODE. Fischer and Turner are instantly killed. 
The explosion ignites the generator. It EXPLODES in a crescendo of flame and sparks.

159A INT. MINE ENTRANCE HALL                                       159A The spotlights are extinguished. Agent Miles and the remaining Agents turn on their rifle-mounted lamps. 
Miles' scanner registers dozens of signals approaching. A gent Miles OPENS FIRE, sending a stream of glowing bullets at the approaching creatures. 
GUNFIRE rings out all around. Glowing bullets streak through the dark night in all directions. Nearby, an Agent SCREAMS. 
The 713 defenses have become chaotic, uncontrolled. Glowing bullets fly everywhere. The SQUEALS of injured creatures mingle with the SCREAMS of dying Agents. The constant RATTLE of automatic GUNFIRE fills the night. 
INT. SAND CHAMBER arr and Carnby lay Cheung and Marko's bodies to one side of the Chamber, their faces covered with their vests. 
Burke paces back and forth, screaming into his comm-link. 
BURKE (INTO COMM-LINK) Miles! Re-route those `copters! Pull all agents back into the mine! Set formation in teams of three! Miles! 
But all that he can hear through the comm-link is GUNFIRE and the occasional SCREAM. 
BURKE (CONT'D) Goddamn it! 
Carnby approaches Burke carefully. Burke looks furious. C CARNBY We'll find a way out. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Burke signals to Barr. They sweep through the Sand Chamber, exploring it with their lamps. 
Carnby approaches Aline. She is standing over one of the sand worm corpses. Its head has been blown off, but its torso is intact. Carnby turns the sand worm's body over with his boot. 
CARNBY (CONT'D) It's just like the organism Fischer took out of Pinkerton. 
ALINE Maybe this is what they look like when they grow outside a human host? 
Burke stops at a dark recess carved into the Sand Chamber. The recess is thick with cobwebs and dust. 
Burke cleans the cobwebs away. He stops, surprised at what he sees in the recess behind the cobwebs. 
BURKE I think you'd better see this.

Suddenly, an invisible creature grabs the first Agent from behind a rusty piece of machinery. The creature throws the Agent into the air. He lands heavily, stunned. 
Before the Agent can get to his feet, three invisible creatures pounce, tearing him to shreds. 
rom behind his position, Miles SHOOTS at the creatures with glowing bullets, scattering them. 
The second Agent stands behind a piece of machinery, tense, rifle ready. She hears a WHOOSH of movement nearby. She turns, but can't see anything. 
She hears a SHUFFLING sound above her. She looks up. The creature is above her, on top of the machinery. 
The Agent tries to SHOOT, but the creature's tail SNAPS at her, impaling her with its tail-spike. 
Agent Miles and Agent Feenstra SHOOT at the creature with precise BURSTS of glowing bullets.

The creature leaps at them. Miles and Feenstra hold their positions, RIDDLING the creature with glowing bullets. 
A creature leaps out at Feenstra. She hears the WHOOSH of movement at the last moment and swivels, FIRING in the direction of the creature. 
ut she's SLAMMED off her feet. Feenstra gets a deep GASH in her thigh from the creature's spiked tail. 
AGENT MILES Feenstra! 
The creature pounces. But Feenstra is fast enough. She BLOWS AWAY the creature with a BURST of glowing bullets. 
SCENE 116A OMITTED 
INT. SAND CHAMBER Aline, Carnby, Burke, and Barr stand in front of the dark recess in the Sand Chamber. The recess is completely sealed up by a solid concrete wall. A line comes up to the concrete wall, running her hands along its flat surface. It is obviously not Abkani. 
ALINE The Abkani didn't put this here. 
CONTINUED: 
Each basin has a small metal tag on it. Carnby wipes the layer of dust off one of the metal tags. 
The tag reads: E. CARNBY. 
CARNBY This is where it happened. 
Aline steps up next to Carnby. 
ALINE 
Who did this to you? 
Burke and Barr continue to explore the room with their rifle- 
mounted lamps. Barr finds a pair of huge metal hangar doors. 
AGENT BARR Commander... 
Carnby, Burke, and Aline approach Barr at the hangar doors. 
Next to the hangar doors is a control panel. Barr pulls the front off the control panel, revealing a rusted hand-crank. 
Barr pulls on the hand-crank. It won't give. Carnby joins him and, together, they strain to move the hand-crank. The hand- crank CLANKS into the open position. 
An old mechanism is engaged. The hangar doors slide open, revealing another doorway behind them. But this one is clearly not part of the Lab. 
It is an ancient, solid gold door, carved with Abkani symbols. The gold door is built into a wall of rough rock. It looks like the Lab was built right around the gold door. 
In the center of the door is a small cylindrical opening. A line uses her flashlight to read the symbols on the door. One symbol is prominent among the others: the DARK SPIRIT. 
ALINE Edward, look... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Aline reaches into her pack and takes out the Abkani device. It is the exact size of the cylindrical opening in the door. The same DARK SPIRIT pictogram is engraved on the lynchpin. 
CARNBY So it's a key. 
Burke surveys the room with a grim expression. 
BURKE 
I say we got two options. One, we open this door, deal with whatever's on the other side. ALINE The pictograms carved here make it pretty clear that's a bad idea. 
BURKE Two, we set enough C-4 to bury this place. Keep whatever's in there, down here for good. 
Carnby stares at the gold door. 
CARNBY The answers I've been looking for my whole life could be in there. 
ALINE Some doors are locked for a reason. 
Carnby looks away from the gold door. 
CARNBY Barr... how much C-4 you got left? 
Barr pulls open his pack, revealing several packages of C-4. 
AGENT BARR Enough to blow this place to... 
Barr is cut off by a bullet hitting him in the head. 
Blood spurts out as Barr collapses to the ground, dead. 
Hudgens stands behind them, carrying two pistols. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
HUDGENS I'm afraid I can't allow that. 
Before they can react, Hudgens presses a pistol to Aline's throat. He points the other pistol at Burke and Carnby. 
HUDGENS (CONT'D) Now drop your weapons and back away. 
Carnby and Burke drop their guns and step back. Carnby glares 
at Hudgens.

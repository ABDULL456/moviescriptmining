INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING 
A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs. 
Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style. 
It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion. 
YOUNG MAN No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit. 
YOUNG WOMAN You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous. 
YOUNG MAN I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but  
YOUNG WOMAN  but you forget about it in a day or two - 
YOUNG MAN  yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun. 
YOUNG WOMAN When you go on like this, you know what you sound like? 
YOUNG MAN I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like. 
YOUNG WOMAN You sound like a duck. (imitates a duck) Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack... 
YOUNG MAN Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again. 
YOUNG WOMAN After tonight. 
The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth. 
YOUNG MAN (with a smile) Correct. I got all tonight to quack. 
A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee. 
WAITRESS Can I get anybody anymore coffee? 
YOUNG WOMAN Oh yes, thank you. 
The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man lights up another cigarette. 
YOUNG MAN I'm doin' fine. 
The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke. 
The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee. 
The Young Man goes right back into it. 
YOUNG MAN I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier!  Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: "We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er." 
YOUNG WOMAN Did it work? 
YOUNG MAN Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger. 
YOUNG WOMAN Did they hurt the little girl? 
YOUNG MAN I don't know. There probably never was a little girl  the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone. 
YOUNG WOMAN You wanna rob banks? 
YOUNG MAN I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'. 
YOUNG WOMAN So you don't want to be a bank robber? 
YOUNG MAN Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty. 
YOUNG WOMAN And no more liquor stores? 
YOUNG MAN What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: "Empty out the register," and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em. 
YOUNG WOMAN I'm not gonna kill anybody. 
YOUNG MAN I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it. 
YOUNG WOMAN Well, what else is there, day jobs? 
YOUNG MAN (laughing) Not this life. 
YOUNG WOMAN Well what then? 
He calls to the Waitress. 
YOUNG MAN Garcon! Coffee! 
Then looks to his girl. 
VINCENT Royale with Cheese. 
JULES (repeating) Royale with Cheese. What'd they call a Big Mac? 
VINCENT Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac. 
JULES Le Big Mac. What do they call a Whopper? 
VINCENT I dunno, I didn't go into a Burger King.  But you know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup? 
JULES What? 
VINCENT Mayonnaise. 
JULES Goddamn! 
VINCENT I seen 'em do it. And I don't mean a little bit on the side of the plate, they fuckin' drown 'em in it. 
JULES Uuccch! 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHEVY (TRUNK)  MORNING 
The trunk of the Chevy OPENS UP, Jules and Vincent reach inside, taking out two .45 Automatics, loading and cocking them. 
JULES We should have shotguns for this kind of deal. 
VINCENT How many up there? 
JULES Three or four. 
VINCENT Counting our guy? 
JULES I'm not sure. 
VINCENT So there could be five guys up there? 
JULES It's possible. 
VINCENT We should have fuckin' shotguns. 
They CLOSE the trunk. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING COURTYARD  MORNING 
Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building. 
We TRACK alongside. 
VINCENT What's her name? 
JULES Mia. 
VINCENT How did Marsellus and her meet? 
JULES I dunno, however people meet people. She usta be an actress. 
VINCENT She ever do anything I woulda saw? 
JULES I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot. 
VINCENT What's a pilot? 
JULES Well, you know the shows on TV? 
VINCENT I don't watch TV. 
JULES Yes, but you're aware that there's an invention called television, and on that invention they show shows? 
VINCENT Yeah. 
JULES Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing. 
They enter the apartment building. 
INT. RECEPTION AREA (APARTMENT BUILDING)  MORNING 
Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait for the elevator. 
JULES You remember Antwan Rockamora? Half- black, half-Samoan, usta call him Tony Rocky Horror. 
VINCENT Yeah maybe, fat right? 
JULES I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat. He's got a weight problem.  What's the nigger gonna do, he's Samoan. 
VINCENT I think I know who you mean, what about him? 
JULES Well, Marsellus fucked his ass up good.  And word around the campfire, it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife. 
The elevator arrives, the men step inside. 
INT. ELEVATOR  MORNING 
VINCENT What'd he do, fuck her? 
JULES No no no no no no no, nothin' that bad. 
VINCENT Well what then? 
Brett SCREAMS, breaking into a SHAKING/TREMBLING SPASM in the chair. 
JULES Does-he-look-like-a-bitch?! 
BRETT (in agony) No. 
JULES Then why did you try to fuck 'im like a bitch?! 
BRETT (in spasm) I didn't. 
Now in a lower voice. 
JULES Yes ya did Brett. Ya tried ta fuck 'im.  You ever read the Bible, Brett? 
BRETT (in spasm) Yes. 
JULES There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.  Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." 
The two men EMPTY their guns at the same time on the sitting Brett. 
AGAINST BLACK, TITLE CARD: 
"VINCENT VEGA AND MARSELLUS WALLACE'S WIFE" 
FADE IN: 
MEDIUM SHOT  BUTCH COOLIDGE 
We FADE UP on BUTCH COOLIDGE, a white, 26-year-old prizefighter.  Butch sits at a table wearing a red and blue high school athletic jacket. Talking to him OFF SCREEN is everybody's boss MARSELLUS WALLACE. The black man sounds like a cross between a gangster and a king. 
MARSELLUS (O.S.) I think you're gonna find  when all this shit is over and done  I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker. Thing is Butch, right now you got ability. But painful as it may be, ability don't last. Now that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life, but it's a fact of life your ass is gonna hafta git realistic about. This business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers who thought their ass aged like wine.  Besides, even if you went all the way, what would you be? Feather-weight champion of the world. Who gives a shit? I doubt you can even get a credit card based on that. 
A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front of Butch. Butch picks it up. 
MARSELLUS (O.S.) Now the night of the fight, you may fell a slight sting, that's pride fuckin' wit ya.  Fuck pride! Pride only hurts, it never helps. Fight through that shit. 'Cause a year from now, when you're kickin' it in the Caribbean you're gonna say, "Marsellus Wallace was right." 
BUTCH I got no problem with that. 
MARSELLUS (O.S.) In the fifth, your ass goes down. 
Butch nods his head: "yes." 
MARSELLUS (O.S.) Say it! 
BUTCH In the fifth, my ass goes down. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR (MOVING)  DAY 
Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. From the car radio, ROCKABILLY MUSIC PLAYS. The b.g. is a COLORFUL PROCESS SHOT. 
EXT. SALLY LEROY'S  DAY 
Sally LeRoy's is a large topless bar by LAX that Marsellus owns. 
Vincent's classic Malibu WHIPS into the near empty parking lot and parks next to a white Honda Civic. 
Vince knocks on the door. The front entrance is unlocked, revealing the Dapper Dan fellow on the inside: ENGLISH DAVE. Dave isn't really English, he's a young black man from Baldwin Park, who has run a few clubs for Marsellus, including Sally LeRoy's. 
ENGLISH DAVE Vincent Vega, our man in Amsterdam, git your ass on in here. 
Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene between Vincent and Jules, steps inside. English Dave SLAMS the door in our faces. 
INT. SALLY LEROY'S  DAY 
The spacious club is empty this time of day. English Dave crosses to the bar, and Vince follows. 
VINCENT Where's the big man? 
ENGLISH DAVE He's over there, finishing up some business. 
VINCENT'S POV: Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with his back to us. The huge figure is the infamous and as of yet still UNSEEN Marsellus. 
ENGLISH DAVE (O.S.) Hang back for a second or two, and when you see the white boy leave, go on over.  In the meanwhile, can I make you an espresso? 
VINCENT How 'bout a cup of just plain lo' American? 
ENGLISH DAVE Comin' up. I hear you're taking Mia out tomorrow? 
VINCENT At Marsellus' request. 
ENGLISH DAVE Have you met Mia? 
VINCENT Not yet. 
English Dave smiles to himself. 
VINCENT What's so funny? 
ENGLISH DAVE Not a goddamn thing. 
VINCENT Look, I'm not a idiot. She's the big man's fuckin' wife. I'm gonna sit across a table, chew my food with my mouth closed, laugh at her jokes and that's all I'm gonna do. 
English Dave puts Vince's coffee in front of him. 
ENGLISH DAVE My name's Paul, and this is between y'all. 
Butch bellies up to the bar next to Vincent, drinking his cup of "Plain ol' American." 
BUTCH (to English Dave) Can I get a pack'a Red Apples? 
LANCE Still got your Malibu? 
VINCENT You know what some fucker did to it the other day? 
LANCE What? 
VINCENT Fuckin' keyed it. 
LANCE Oh man, that's fucked up. 
VINCENT Tell me about it. I had the goddamn thing in storage three years. It's out five fuckin' days  five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucks with it. 
LANCE They should be fuckin' killed. No trial, no jury, straight to execution. 
As he cooks his heroin... 
VINCENT I just wish I caught 'em doin' it, ya know?  Oh man, I'd give anything to catch 'em doin' it. It'a been worth his doin' it, if I coulda just caught 'em, you know what I mean? 
LANCE It's chicken shit. You don't fuck another man's vehicle. 
CLOSEUP  THE NEEDLE 
Going into Vincent's vein. 
CLOSEUP  BLOOD 
Spurting back into the syringe, mixing with the heroin. 
CLOSEUP  VINCENT'S THUMB 
Pushing down on the plunger. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE  NIGHT 
Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door 
CLOSEUP  NOTE 
The Note reads: 
"Hi Vincent, I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside and make yourself a drink.  Mia" 
MIA (V.O.) Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. The door's open. Come inside and make yourself a drink. 
FADE TO WHITE 
Music in. 
FADE TO: 
INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
Vincent enters on the background. 
VINCENT Hello? 
INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM  NIGHT 
MIA, Marcellus' beautiful young wife. Video screens are in the background. Dusty Springfield is singing "SON OF A PREACHER MAN". 
Mia's mouth comes toward a microphone. 
MIA (into microphone) Vincent. 
INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
Vincent turns. 
MIA (over intercom) Vincent. I'm on the intercom. 
INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM  NIGHT 
MIA (into microphone) It's on the wall by the two African fellas. 
INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
MIA (over intercom) To your right. 
Vincent walks. 
MIA ...warm. Warmer. Disco. 
Vincent finds the intercom on the wall. 
VINCENT Hello. 
MIA (over intercom) Push the button if you want to talk. 
VINCENT (into intercom) Hello. 
INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / DRESSING ROOM  NIGHT 
MIA (into microphone) Go make yourself a drink., and I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail. 
INT. MARCELLUS' HOUSE / LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
MIA (over intercom) The bar's by the fireplace. 
VINCENT (into intercom) Okay. (licks lips) 
MIA Whaddya think? 
VINCENT It's like a wax museum with a pulse rate. 
Vincent takes out his pouch of tobacco and begins rolling himself a smoke. 
After a second of watching him  
MIA What are you doing? 
VINCENT Rollin' a smoke. 
MIA Here? 
VINCENT It's just tobacco. 
MIA Oh. Well in that case, will you roll me one, cowboy? 
As he finishes licking it  
VINCENT You can have this one, cowgirl. 
He hands her the rolled smoke. She takes it, putting it to her lips. Out of nowhere appears a Zippo lighter in Vincent's hand. He lights it. 
MIA Thanks. 
VINCENT Think nothing of it. 
He begins rolling one for himself. 
As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds. 
Back to Mia and Vincent. 
MIA Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam. 
VINCENT Sure did. I heard you did a pilot. 
MIA That was my fifteen minutes. 
VINCENT What was it? 
MIA It was show about a team of female secret agents called "Fox Force Five." 
VINCENT What? 
MIA "Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in there's one... two ... three... four... five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show "Baton Rouge," she was the leader. A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me.  We all had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex... 
VINCENT What was your specialty? 
MIA Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist  when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke. 
VINCENT Do you remember any of the jokes? 
MIA Well I only got the chance to say one, 'cause we only did one show. 
VINCENT Tell me. 
MIA No. It's really corny. 
VINCENT C'mon, don't be that way. 
MIA No. You won't like it and I'll be embarrassed. 
VINCENT You told it in front of fifty million people and you can't tell it to me? I promise I won't laugh. 
MIA (laughing) That's what I'm afraid of. 
VINCENT That's not what I meant and you know it. 
MIA You're quite the silver tongue devil, aren't you? 
VINCENT I meant I wouldn't laugh at you. 
MIA That's not what you said Vince. Well now I'm definitely not gonna tell ya, 'cause it's been built up too much. 
VINCENT What a gyp. 
Buddy comes back with the drinks. Mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake. 
MIA Yummy! 
VINCENT Can I have a sip of that? I'd like to know what a five-dollar shake tastes like. 
MIA Be my guest. 
She slides the shake over to him. 
MIA You can use my straw, I don't have kooties. 
Vincent smiles. 
VINCENT Yeah, but maybe I do. 
MIA Kooties I can handle. 
He takes a sip. 
VINCENT Goddamn! That's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake. 
MIA Told ya. 
MIA Let me help you Bashful, did it involve the F-word? 
VINCENT No. They just said Rocky Horror gave you a foot massage. 
MIA And...? 
VINCENT No and, that's it. 
MIA You heard Marsellus threw Rocky Horror out of a four-story window because he massaged my feet? 
VINCENT Yeah. 
MIA And you believed that? 
VINCENT At the time I was told, it seemed reasonable. 
MIA Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable? 
VINCENT No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you. 
MIA A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else. 
VINCENT But did it happen? 
MIA The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once  at my wedding  then never again.  The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle. 
CUT TO: 
ED SULLIVAN AND MARILYN MONROE STAND ON STAGE 
ED SULLIVAN (into microphone) Ladies and gentlemen, now the moment you've all been waiting for, the worldfamous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest. 
Patrons cheer. 
Ed Sullivan is with Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy. 
ED SULLIVAN ...One lucky couple will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding. 
Marilyn holds the trophy. 
ED SULLIVAN ...Now, who will be our first contestants? 
Mia holds her hand. 
MIA Right here. 
Vincent reacts. 
MIA I wanna dance. 
VINCENT No, no, no no, no, no, no, no. 
MIA (overlapping) No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss, told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted, Now, I want to dance. I want to win. I want that trophy. 
VINCENT (sighs) All right. 
MIA So, dance good. 
VINCENT All right, you asked for it. 
Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor, toward Ed Sullivan. 
ED SULLIVAN (into microphone) Let's hear it for our first contestants. 
Patrons cheer. 
Vincent and Mia walk up to the microphone. 
ED SULLIVAN Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening. Young lady, what is your name? 
MIA (into microphone) Missus Mia Wallace. 
ED SULLIVAN (into microphone) And, uh, how 'bout your fella here? 
MIA (into microphone) Vincent Vega. 
ED SULLIVAN (into microphone) All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away! 
Mia and Vincent dance to Chuck Berry's "YOU NEVER CAN TELL". They make hand movements as they dance. 
INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOME  NIGHT 
The front door FLINGS open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango- style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the previous scene. They finish their little dance, laughing. 
Then... 
The two just stand face to face looking at each other. 
VINCENT Was than an uncomfortable silence? 
MIA I don't know what that was. (pause) Music and drinks! 
Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove. 
VINCENT I'm gonna take a piss. 
MIA That was a little bit more information than I needed to know, but go right ahead. 
Vincent shuffles off to the john. 
Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It feels good. 
Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up. 
JODY (O.S.) Lance! The phone's ringing! 
LANCE (calling back) I can hear it! 
JODY (O.S.) I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call this late! 
LANCE (by the phone) I told 'em and that's what I'm gonna tell this fuckin' asshole right now! (he answers the phone) Hello, do you know how late it is? You're not supposed to be callin' me this fuckin' late. 
BACK TO: 
VINCENT IN THE MALIBU 
Vincent is still driving like a stripe-assed ape, clutching the phone to his ear. WE CUT BACK AND FORTH during the conversation. 
VINCENT Lance, this is Vincent, I'm in big fuckin' trouble man, I'm on my way to your place. 
LANCE Whoa, hold you horses man, what's the problem? 
VINCENT You still got an adrenaline shot? 
LANCE (dawning on him) Maybe. 
VINCENT I need it man, I got a chick she's fuckin'  Doing on me. 
LANCE Don't bring her here!  I'm not even fuckin' joking with you, don't you be bringing some fucked up pooh-butt to my house! 
VINCENT No choice. 
LANCE She's ODin'? 
VINCENT Yeah. She's dyin'. 
LANCE Then bite the fuckin' bullet, take 'er to a hospital and call a lawyer! 
VINCENT Negative. 
LANCE She ain't my fuckin' problem, you fucked her up, you deal with it  are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone? 
VINCENT Sorry. 
LANCE I don't know you, who is this, don't come here, I'm hangin' up. 
VINCENT Too late, I'm already here. 
At that moment inside Lance's house, WE HEAR VINCENT's Malibu coming up the street. Lance hangs up the phone, goes to his curtains and YANKS the cord. The curtains open with a WHOOSH in time to see Vincent's Malibu DRIVING UP on his front lawn and CRASHING into his house. The window Lance is looking out of SHATTERS from the impact. 
JODY (O.S.) What the hell was that? 
Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front lawn. 
EXT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT 
Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out. 
LANCE Have you lost your mind?! You crashed your car in my fuckin' house! You talk about drug shit on a cellular fuckin' phone  
VINCENT If you're through havin' your little hissy fit, this chick is dyin', get your needle and git it now! 
LANCE Are you deaf? You're not bringin' that fucked up bitch in my house! 
VINCENT This fucked up bitch is Marsellus Wallace's wife. Now if she fuckin' croaks on me, I'm a grease spot. But before he turns me into a bar soap, I'm gonna be forced to tell 'im about how you coulda saved her life, but instead you let her die on your front lawn. 
INT. LANCE'S HOUSE  NIGHT 
WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom. 
Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on it. 
We follow HANDHELD behind her as she opens the door, walking through the hall into the living room. 
JODY It's only one-thirty in the goddamn mornin'! What the fuck's goin' on out here? 
As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of the room. 
From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing. 
JODY Who's she? 
Lance looks up at Jody. 
LANCE Get that black box in the bedroom I have with the adrenaline shot. 
JODY What's wrong with her? 
VINCENT She's ODing on us. 
JODY Well get her the hell outta here! 
LANCE AND VINCENT (in stereo) Get the fuckin' shot! 
JODY Don't yell and me! 
She angrily turns and disappears into the bedroom looking for the shot. 
WE MOVE into the room with the two men. 
VINCENT (to Lance) You two are a match made in heaven. 
LANCE Look, just keep talkin' to her, okay? While she's gettin' the shot, I gotta get a medical book. 
LANCE It's ready, I'll tell you what to do. 
VINCENT You're gonna give her the shot. 
LANCE No, you're gonna give her the shot. 
VINCENT I've never does this before. 
LANCE I've never done this before either, and I ain't starting now. You brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot. The day I bring an ODing bitch to your place, then I gotta give her the shot. 
Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic marker in her hand. 
JODY Got it. 
Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is. 
VINCENT Okay, what do I do? 
LANCE Well, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart. But she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. So what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion. 
Lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "The Shape" killing its victims in "HALLOWEEN". 
VINCENT I gotta stab her? 
LANCE If you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard. 
Then once you do, push down on the plunger. 
VINCENT What happens after that? 
LANCE I'm curious about that myself. 
VINCENT This ain't a fuckin' joke man! 
LANCE She's supposed to come out of it like  (snaps his fingers)  that. 
Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion. 
He looks down on Mia. 
Mia is fading fast. Soon nothing will help her. 
Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this. 
VINCENT Count to three. 
Lance, on this knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect. 
LANCE One... 
RED DOT on Mia's body. 
Needle raised ready to strike. 
LANCE (O.S.) ...two... 
Jody's face is alive with anticipation. 
NEEDLE in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike. 
LANCE (O.S.) ...three! 
The needle leaves frame, THRUSTING down hard. 
Vincent brings the needle down hard, STABBING Mia in the chest. 
Mia's head is JOLTED from the impact. 
The syringe plunger is pushed down, PUMPING the adrenaline out through the needle. 
Mia's eyes POP WIDE OPEN and she lets out a HELLISH cry of the banshee. She BOLTS UP in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest  SCREAMING. 
Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in front of Mia, JUMP BACK, scared to death. 
Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of air. 
The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright. 
LANCE If you're okay, say something. 
Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice. 
MIA Something. 
Vincent and Lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and shaking from how close to death Mia came. 
JODY Anybody want a beer? 
CUT TO: 
INT. VINCENT'S MALIBU (MOVING)  NIGHT 
Vincent is behind the wheel driving Mia home. No one says anything, both are still too shaken. 
EXT. FRONT OF MARSELLUS WALLACE'S HOUSE  NIGHT 
The Malibu pulls up to the front. Mia gets out without saying a word (still in a daze) and begins walking down the walkway toward her front door. 
VINCENT (O.S.) Mia! 
She turns around. 
As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, empty locker room. 
FADE TO BLACK 
TITLE CARD: 
"THE GOLD WATCH" 
We hear over the black and white title: 
SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.)  Well Dan, that had to be the bloodiest and, hands-down, the most brutal fight this city has ever seen. 
The SOUND of chaos in the b.g. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. ALLEY (RAINING)  NIGHT 
A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. The sky is PISSIN' DOWN RAIN. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from inside. 
SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.) ...Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a victorious boxer vacate the ring. Do you think he knew Willis was dead? 
SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.) My guess would be yes, Richard. I could see from my position here, the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing. I think any man would've left the ring that fast. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING)  NIGHT 
Inside the taxi, behind the wheel, is a female cabbie named ESMARELDA VILLALOBOS. A young woman, with Spanish looks, sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a white styrofoam cup. 
The Sportscasters continue their coverage. 
SPORTSCASTER #1 (O.S.) Do you feel this ring death tragedy will have an effect on the world of boxing? 
SPORTSCASTER #2 (O.S.) Oh Dan, a tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundation. But it's of paramount importance that during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the W.B.A. remain firmly fixed on the  
CLICK  Esmarelda shuts off the radio. 
She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see: 
EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)  NIGHT 
A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium- side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to the dumpster below. 
ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight. 
Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and throws it to the ground. 
INT. TAXI (PARKED / RAINING)  NIGHT 
Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door. 
Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through the rearview mirror: 
ESMARELDA (Spanish accent) Are you the man I was supposed to pick up? 
BUTCH If you're the cab I called, I'm the guy you're supposed to pick up. 
ESMARELDA Where to? 
BUTCH Outta here. 
The ignition key is TWISTED. The engine ROARS to life. 
The meter is FLIPPED on. 
Esmarelda's bare foot STOMPS on the gas pedal. 
EXT. BOXING AUDITORIUM (RAINING)  NIGHT 
The cab WHIPS out of the alley, FISH-TAILING on the wet pavement in front of the auditorium at a rapid pace. 
INT. WILLIS LOCKER ROOM (AUDITORIUM)  NIGHT 
Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave takes time to adjust his suit and tie. Mia is standing by the door. She sees Vincent with English Dave. 
VINCENT Mia. How you doin'? 
MIA Great. I never thanked you for the dinner. 
In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table  dead. 
His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body. 
The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big. 
Mia sits in a chair at the far end of the room. 
Marsellus looks up, sees English Dave and walks over to him. 
MARSELLUS (O.S.) What'cha got? 
ENGLISH DAVE He booked. 
MARSELLUS (O.S.) I'm prepared to scour the earth for this motherfucker. If Butch goes to Indo China, I want a nigger hidin' in a bowl of rice, ready to pop a cap in his ass. 
ENGLISH DAVE I'll take care of it. 
INT. CAB (MOVING / RAINING)  NIGHT 
Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off. 
Fabienne SCREAMS and backs into a corner, Butch picks up the motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall. 
Fabienne SCREAMS IN HORROR. 
Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm. 
BUTCH (to Fabienne) No! It's not your fault. (he approached her) You left it at the apartment. 
He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor. 
He touches her hand, she flinches. 
BUTCH If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff. I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was my watch, I should've told you. You ain't a mind reader. 
He kisses her hand. Then rises. 
Fabienne is still sniffling. 
Butch goes to the closet. 
FABIENNE I'm sorry. 
Butch puts on his high school jacket. 
BUTCH Don't be. It just means I won't be able to eat breakfast with you. 
FABIENNE Why does it mean that? 
BUTCH Because I'm going back to my apartment to get my watch. 
FABIENNE Won't the gangsters be looking for you there? 
BUTCH That's what I'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, I'll split. 
Rising from the floor. 
FABIENNE I was so dreadful. I saw your watch, I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry. 
Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face. 
BUTCH Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you. (pause) I love you, remember? (he digs some money out of his wallet) Now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast. 
FABIENNE Don't go. 
BUTCH I'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie. 
FABIENNE Blueberry pie. 
BUTCH Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay?  Okay? 
FABIENNE Okay. 
He kisses her once more and heads for the door. 
BUTCH Bye-bye, sugar pop. 
FABIENNE Bye. 
BUTCH I'm gonna take your Honda. 
FABIENNE Okay. 
And with that, he's out the door. 
Fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her. 
INT. HONDA (MOVING)  DAY 
Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street. 
BUTCH Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget it. "Bedside table  on the kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch." 
EXT. CITY STREET  DAY 
The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it. 
CUT TO: 
A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow pointing at one hour. 
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER  DAY 
Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door. 
EXT. ALLEY  DAY 
Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out. 
EXT. STREET  BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY 
Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside. Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home. 
Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information. 
Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard. 
Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice. 
EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY 
Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment building. Once again, everything appears normal  the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door  nothing appears disturbed. 
DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?" 
Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. He STOMPS on the gas pedal. 
The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour. 
Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk. 
Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside. 
PEDESTRIAN Jesus, are you okay? 
Butch look at him, spaced-out. 
BUTCH I guess. 
Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS gather around the body. 
GAWKER #1 (to the others) He's dead! He's dead! 
This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to. 
TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage. 
The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet. 
GAWKER #2 If you need a witness in court, I'll be glad to help. He was a drunken maniac. He hit you and crashed into that car. 
MARSELLUS (still incoherent) Who? 
GAWKER #2 (pointing at Butch) Him. 
Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge down the street, looking a shambles. 
MARSELLUS Well, I'll be damned. 
The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back away. 
Marsellus starts moving toward Butch. 
Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward him. 
BUTCH Sacre bleu. 
Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild. 
He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, screaming. 
LOOKY-LOO WOMAN Oh my God, I've been shot! 
That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here. 
Marsellus RUNS after him. 
The CROWD looks agape. 
Butch is in a mad, limping RUN. 
The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run. 
Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP". 
INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP  DAY 
MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch RACES into his world. 
MAYNARD Can I help you wit' somethin'? 
BUTCH Shut up! 
Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door. 
MAYNARD Now you just wait one goddamn minute 
Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist in Marsellus' face. 
The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man FALLS FLAT on his back. 
Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by. 
Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in the face. 
Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger. 
BUTCH So you like chasing people, huh? 
He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound.  Butch then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter. 
BUTCH Well guess what, big man, you caught me  
MAYNARD (O.S.)  hold it right there, godammit! 
Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pumpaction shotgun, aimed at the two men. 
BUTCH Look mister, this ain't any of your business  
MAYNARD  I'm makin' it my business! Now toss that gun! 
Butch does. 
MAYNARD Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter. 
ZED Wanna do it here? 
MAYNARD Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room. 
Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old room. 
Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty. 
As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room. 
MAYNARD (to The Gimp) Up! 
The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on the ceiling. 
MAYNARD Keep an eye on this one. 
The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air. 
Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy. 
From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and: 
MAYNARD (O.S.) Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in 'em! 
We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus. 
ZED (O.S.) You wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I like to fight! 
Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free. 
The Gimp is laughing wildly. 
The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free. 
The Gimp slaps his knee laughing In the back room, we hear: 
MAYNARD (O.S.) That's it... that's it boy, you're goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like that... that's good. (grunting faster) Stay still... stay still goddamn ya! Zed goddammit, git over here and hold 'em! 
Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt. 
The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen. 
THE GIMP Huhng? 
The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts. 
Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash attached to the hook, Butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains. 
INT. PAWNSHOP  DAY 
Butch sneaks to the door. 
On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with Marsellus. 
Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in with. 
He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots what he's been looking for: 
A Samurai sword. 
It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Kenstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business. 
INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM  DAY 
Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon. 
Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to Russell's old room. 
INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM  DAY 
Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions. 
Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse. 
Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch. 
Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up behind him with the sword. 
Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen. 
BUTCH Hey hillbilly. 
Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword. 
Butch SCREAMS... with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed. 
Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock. 
Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES. 
Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, which lies within reach. 
Butch's eyes follow Zed's. 
BUTCH You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up. 
Zed's hand inches toward the weapon. 
Butch GRIPS the sword tighter. 
Zed studies Butch. 
Butch realizes that this is not the way to get her on the bike. He turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her hand. 
BUTCH I'm sorry, baby-love. 
FABIENNE (crying) You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts. 
BUTCH I'm sorry I worried you, sweetie. Everything's fine. Hey, how was breakfast? 
FABIENNE (waterworks drying a little) It was good  
BUTCH  did you get the blueberry pancakes? 
FABIENNE No, they didn't have blueberry pancakes, I had to get buttermilk  are you sure you're okay? 
BUTCH Baby-love, from the moment I left you, this has been without a doubt the single weirdest day of my entire life. Climb on an' I'll tell ya about it. 
Fabienne does climb on. Butch STARTS her up. 
FABIENNE Butch, whose motorcycle is this? 
BUTCH It's a chopper. 
FABIENNE Whose chopper is this? 
BUTCH Zed's. 
FABIENNE Who's Zed? 
BUTCH Zed's dead, baby, Zed's dead. 
And with that, the two lovebirds PEEL AWAY on Grace, as the SONG on the BOOM BOX RISES. 
FADE TO BLACK 
TITLE CARD: 
"JULES VINCENT JIMMIE & THE WOLF" 
TITLE DISAPPEARS. 
Over black, we can HEAR in the distance, men talking. 
JULES (O.S.) You ever read the Bible, Brett? 
BRETT (O.S.) Yes! 
JULES (O.S.) There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men..." 
FADE UP: 
INT. BATHROOM  DAY 
We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly CLUTCHING his huge silver .357 Magnum. 
JULES (O.S.) "...blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherded the weak through the valley of darkness. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." 
BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM! 
The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door. 
Then he listens to them talk. 
VINCENT (O.S.) Friend of yours? 
JULES (O.S.) Yeah, Marvin-Vincent-Vincent-Marvin. 
Waiting for them isn't the smartest move. Bursting out the door and blowing them all away while they're fuckin' around is the way to go. 
INT. APARTMENT  DAY 
The bathroom door BURSTS OPEN and the Fourth Man CHARGES out, silver Magnum raised, FIRING SIX BOOMING SHOTS from his hand cannon. 
FOURTH MAN Die... die... die... die...! 
DOLLY INTO Fourth Man, same as before. 
He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion crosses his face. 
TWO SHOT  JULES AND VINCENT 
Standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man. 
FOURTH MAN I don't understand  
The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD. 
The two men lower their guns. Jules, obviously shaken, sits down in a chair. Vincent, after a moment of respect, shrugs it off. 
Then heads toward Marvin in the corner. 
VINCENT Why the fuck didn't you tell us about that guy in the bathroom? Slip your mind?  Forget he was in there with a goddamn hand cannon? 
JULES (to himself) We should be fuckin' dead right now. (pause) Did you see that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him. 
VINCENT 
JULES We should be fuckin' dead! 
VINCENT Yeah, we were lucky. 
Jules rises, moving toward Vincent. 
Jules takes out a cellular phone and starts punching digits. 
VINCENT Who ya callin'? 
JULES A buddy of mine in Toluca Lake. 
VINCENT Where's Toluca Lake. 
JULES On the other side of the hill, by Burbank Studios. If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we're gonna go. I ain't got any other partners in 818. (into phone) Jimmie! How you doin' man, it's Jules. (pause) Listen up man, me an' my homeboy are in some serious shit. We're in a car we gotta get off the road, pronto! I need to use your garage for a couple hours. 
INT. JIMMIE'S BATHROOM  DAY 
Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands while Vincent stands behind him. 
JULES We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie's situation. He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door. 
VINCENT If he kicks us out, whadda we do? 
JULES Well, we ain't leavin' 'til we made a couple phone calls. But I never want it to reach that pitch. Jimmie's my friend and you don't bust in your friend's house and start tellin' 'im what's what. 
Jules rises and dries his hands. Vincent takes his place at the sink. 
VINCENT Just tell 'im not to be abusive. He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin. 
JULES Put yourself in his position. It's eight o'clock in the morning. He just woke up, he wasn't prepared for this shit. Don't forget who's doin' who a favor. 
Vincent finishes, then dries his hands on a white towel. 
VINCENT If the price of that favor is I gotta take shit, he can stick his favor straight up his ass. 
When Vincent is finished drying his hands, the towel is stained with red. 
JULES What the fuck did you just do to his towel? 
VINCENT I was just dryin' my hands. 
JULES You're supposed to wash 'em first. 
VINCENT You watched me wash 'em. 
JULES I watched you get 'em wet. 
VINCENT I washed 'em. Blood's real hard to get off. Maybe if he had some Lava, I coulda done a better job. 
JULES I used the same soap you did and when I dried my hands, the towel didn't look like a fuckin' Maxie pad. Look, fuck it, alright. Who cares? But it's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a boil. If he were to come in here and see that towel like that... I'm tellin' you Vincent, you best be cool. 'Cause if I gotta get in to it with Jimmie on account of you... Look, I ain't threatenin' you, I respect you an' all, just don't put me in that position. 
JULES Jules, you ask me nice like that, no problem. He's your friend, you handle him. 
INT. JIMMIE'S KITCHEN  MORNING 
Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug of coffee. Jules, Vincent and JIMMIE DIMMICK, a young man in his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe. 
JULES Goddamn Jimmie, this is some serious gourmet shit. Me an' Vincent woulda been satisfied with freeze-dried Tasters Choice. You spring this gourmet fuckin' shit on us. What flavor is this? 
JIMMIE Knock it off, Julie. 
JULES What? 
JIMMIE I'm not a cobb or corn, so you can stop butterin' me up. I don't need you to tell me how good my coffee is. I'm the one who buys it, I know how fuckin' good it is.  When Bonnie goes shoppin;, she buys shit.  I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it. But what's on my mind at this moment isn't the coffee in my kitchen, it's the dead nigger in my garage. 
JULES Jimmie  
JIMMIE  I'm talkin'. Now let me ask you a question, Jules. When you drove in here, did you notice a sign out front that said, "Dead nigger storage?" 
Jules starts to "Jimmie" him  
JIMMIE  answer to question. Did you see a sign out in front of my house that said, "Dead nigger storage?" 
JULES (playing along) Naw man, I didn't. 
JIMMIE You know why you didn't see that sign? 
JULES Why? 
JIMMIE 'Cause storin' dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business! 
Jules starts to "Jimmie" him. 
JIMMIE  I ain't through! Now don't you understand that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced. No marriage counselor, no trial separation  fuckin' divorced. And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced. The last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit was gonna be the last time me an' Bonnie talked about this shit. Now I wanna help ya out Julie, I really do. But I ain't gonna lose my wife doin' it. 
JULES Jimmie  
JIMMIE  don't fuckin' Jimmie me, man, I can't be Jimmied. There's nothin' you can say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Now she's workin' the graveyard shift at the hospital. She'll be comin' home in less than an hour and a half. Make your phone calls, talk to your people, than get the fuck out of my house. 
JULES That's all we want. We don't wanna fuck up your shit. We just need to call our people to bring us in. 
JIMMIE Then I suggest you get to it. Phone's in my bedroom. 
INT. MARSELLUS WALLACE'S DINING ROOM  MORNING 
Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone. 
MARSELLUS ...well, say she comes home. Whaddya think she'll do? (pause) No fuckin' shit she'll freak. That ain't no kinda answer. You know 'er, I don't.  How bad, a lot or a little? 
INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM  MORNING 
Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone. 
JULES You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is. If she comes home from a hard day's work and finds a bunch of gangsters doin' a bunch of gangsta' shit in her kitchen, ain't no tellin' what she's apt to do. 
MARSELLUS I've grasped that, Jules. All I'm doin' is contemplating the "ifs." 
INT. KITCHEN  MORNING 
Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee. 
THE WOLF Thank you, Jimmie. 
He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three men the plan of action. 
THE WOLF Okay first thing, you two. (meaning Jules and Vincent) Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleansers and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct? 
JIMMIE Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink. 
THE WOLF Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there.  Wipe down the upholstery  now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off it. Give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.  But the windows are a different story.  Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal.  Jimmie  lead the way, boys  get to work. 
The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen. 
VINCENT (calling after him) A "please" would be nice. 
The Wolf stops and turns around. 
THE WOLF Come again? 
VINCENT I said a "please" would be nice. 
The Wolf takes a step toward him. 
THE WOLF Set is straight, Buster. I'm not here to say "please."I'm here to tell you want to do. And if self- preservation is an instinct you possess, you better fuckin' do it and do it quick. I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck gentlemen. 
JULES It ain't that way, Mr. Wolf. Your help is definitely appreciated. 
VINCENT I don't mean any disrespect. I just don't like people barkin' orders at me. 
THE WOLF If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor. I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you want to get out of this. So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car. 
INT. JIMMIE'S BEDROOM  MORNING 
Jimmie's gathering all the bedspreads, quilts and linen he has. 
The Wolf is on the phone. 
THE WOLF (into phone) It's a 1974 Chevy Nova. (pause) White. (pause) Nothin', except for the mess inside. (pause) About twenty minutes. (pause) Nobody who'll be missed. (pause) You're a good man, Joe. See ya soon. (he looks at Jimmie) How we comin', Jimmie? 
Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen. 
JIMMIE Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand somethin'  
THE WOLF  Winston, Jimmie  please, Winston. 
JIMMIE You gotta understand something, Winston. I want to help you guys out and all, but that's my best linen. It was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny, and they ain't with us anymore  
THE WOLF  let me ask you a question, if you don't mind? 
JIMMIE Sure. 
THE WOLF Were you Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny millionaires? 
JIMMIE No. 
THE WOLF Well, your Uncle Marsellus is. And I'm positive if Uncle Conrad and Aunt Ginny were millionaires, they would've furnished you with a whole bedroom set, which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do. (takes out a roll of bills) I like oak myself, that's what's in my bedroom. How 'bout you Jimmie, you an oak man? 
JIMMIE Oak's nice. 
INT. GARAGE  MORNING 
Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain. 
Both are twice as bloody as they were before. 
JULES I will never forgive your ass for this shit. This is some fucked-up repugnant shit! 
VINCENT Did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits he's wrong, he's immediately forgiven for all wrong-doings? 
JULES Man, get outta my face with that shit! The motherfucker who said that never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull with his fingers on account of your dumb ass. 
VINCENT I got a threshold, Jules. I got a threshold for the abuse I'll take. And you're crossin' it. I'm a race car and you got me in the red. Redline 7000, that's where you are. Just know, it's fuckin' dangerous to be drivin' a race car when it's in the red. It could blow. 
JULES You're gettin' ready to blow? I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker! Every time my fingers touch brain I'm "SUPERFLY T.N.T," I'm the "GUNS OF NAVARONE." I'm what Jimmie Walker usta talk about. In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back?  You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail. We're tradin'. I'm washin' windows and you're pickin' up this nigger's skull. 
INT. CHEVY NOVA  MORNING 
The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads and quilts. Believe it or not, what looked like a portable slaughterhouse can actually pass for a non-descript vehicle. 
The Wolf circles the car examining it. 
Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job they've done. 
THE WOLF Fine job, gentlemen. We may get out of this yet. 
JIMMIE I can't believe that's the same car. 
THE WOLF Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet. Phase one is complete, clean the car, which moves us right along to phase two, clean you two. 
EXT. JIMMIE'S BACKYARD  MORNING 
Jules and Vincent stand side by side in their black suits, covered in blood, in Jimmie's backyard. Jimmie holds a plastic Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one of those guns nozzles attached. 
THE WOLF Strip. 
VINCENT All the way? 
THE WOLF To your bare ass. 
WINSTON (painfully) It's your future: I see... a cab ride. (dropping the act) Sorry guys, move out of the sticks. (to Raquel) Say goodbye, Raquel. 
RAQUEL Goodbye, Raquel. 
WINSTON I'll see you two around, and stay outta trouble, you crazy kids. 
Winston turns to leave. 
JULES Mr. Wolf. 
He turns around. 
JULES I was a pleasure watchin' you work. 
The Wolf smiles. 
WINSTON Call me Winston. 
He turns and banters with Raquel as they get in the Porsche. 
WINSTON You hear that, young lady? Respect. You could lean a lot from those two fine specimens. Respect for one's elders shows character. 
RAQUEL I have character. 
WINSTON Just because you are a character doesn't mean you have character. 
RAQUEL Oh you're so funny, oh you're so funny. 
The Porsche SHOOTS OFF down the road. 
The two men left alone look at each other. 
JULES Wanna share a cab? 
VINCENT You know I could go for some breakfast.  Want to have breakfast with me? 
JULES Sure. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING 
Jules and Vincent sit at a booth. In front of Vincent is a big stack of pancakes and sausages, which he eats with gusto. Jules, on the other hand, just has a cup of coffee and a muffin. He seems far away in thought. The Waitress pours a refill for both men, 
VINCENT Thanks a bunch. (to Jules, who's nursing his coffee) Want a sausage? 
JULES Naw, I don't eat pork. 
VINCENT Are you Jewish? 
JULES I ain't Jewish man, I just don't dig on swine. 
VINCENT Why not? 
JULES They're filthy animals. I don't eat filthy animals. 
VINCENT Sausages taste good. Pork chops taste good. 
JULES A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie.  I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces. 
VINCENT How about dogs? Dogs eat their own feces. 
JULES I don't eat dog either. 
VINCENT Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal? 
JULES I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way. 
VINCENT So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal? 
JULES We'd have to be talkin' 'bout one motherfuckin' charmin' pig. It'd have to be the Cary Grant of pigs. 
The two men laugh. 
VINCENT Good for you. Lighten up a little. You been sittin' there all quiet. 
JULES I just been sittin' here thinkin'. 
VINCENT (mouthful of food) About what? 
JULES The miracle we witnessed. 
VINCENT The miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence. 
JULES Do you know that a miracle is? 
VINCENT An act of God. 
JULES What's an act of God? 
VINCENT I guess it's when God makes the impossible possible. And I'm sorry Jules, but I don't think what happened this morning qualifies. 
JULES Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved. 
VINCENT But why? 
JULES That's what's fuckin' wit' me! I don't know why. But I can't go back to sleep. 
VINCENT So you're serious, you're really gonna quit? 
JULES The life, most definitely. 
Vincent takes a bite of food. Jules takes a sip of coffee In the b.g., we see a PATRON call the Waitress. 
PUMPKIN In the bag. 
Jules DROPS his wallet in the bag. Using his gun as a pointer, Pumpkin points to the briefcase. 
PUMPKIN What's in that? 
JULES My boss' dirty laundry. 
PUMPKIN You boss makes you do his laundry? 
JULES When he wants it clean. 
PUMPKIN Sounds like a shit job. 
JULES Funny, I've been thinkin' the same thing. 
PUMPKIN Open it up. 
Jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase. 
JULES 'Fraid I can't do that. 
Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the hammer. 
PUMPKIN I didn't hear you. 
JULES Yes, you did. 
This exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but Honey Bunny senses something's wrong. 
HONEY BUNNY What's goin' on? 
PUMPKIN Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst. 
HONEY BUNNY Shoot 'em in the face! 
JULES I don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had gun pointed at me. 
PUMPKIN You don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last. 
MANAGER (on the ground) Quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! Give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here. 
JULES Keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business! 
PUMPKIN I'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, I'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. Clear? One... 
PUMPKIN ...two... three. 
JULES You win. 
Jules raises his hand off the briefcase. 
JULES It's all yours, Ringo. 
PUMPKIN Open it. 
Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across the room, can't see shit. 
HONEY BUNNY What is it? What is it? 
PUMPKIN (softly) Is that what I think it is? 
Jules nods his head: "yes." 
PUMPKIN It's beautiful. 
Jules nods his head: "yes." 
HONEY BUNNY Goddammit, what is it? 
Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case. 
Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 hand under Pumpkin's chin. 
Honey Bunny freaks out, waving her gun in Jules' direction. 
HONEY BUNNY Let him go! Let him go! I'll blow your fuckin' head off! I'll kill ya! I'll kill ya! You're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad! 
JULES (to Pumpkin) Tell that bitch to be cool! Say, bitch be cool! Say, bitch be cool! 
PUMPKIN Chill out, honey! 
HONEY BUNNY Let him go! 
JULES (softly) Tell her it's gonna be okay. 
PUMPKIN I'm gonna be okay. 
JULES Promise her. 
PUMPKIN I promise. 
JULES Tell her to chill. 
PUMPKIN Just chill out. 
JULES What's her name? 
PUMPKIN Yolanda. 
Whenever Jules talks to Yolanda, he never looks at her, only at Pumpkin.

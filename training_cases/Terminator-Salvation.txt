LONGVIEW STATE CORRECTIONAL FACILITY, TEXAS, 2003. 
FADE IN ON: 
INT.   DEATH ROW/CELL - DAWN 
START TIGHT ON MARCUS WRIGHT. He's an intense, powerful man, 20's-30's, his head shaven. Marcus stares INTO CAMERA with a resigned expression. We hear the voice of a PRIEST: 
PRIEST Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art beside me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me... 
CAMERA PULLS BACK, straight up. MARCUS lies in his cot, staring at the ceiling. He's smoking a CIGARETTE. This OVERHEAD ANGLE reveals a PRIEST with a BIBLE, in a folding chair beside him. A CHESS SET, stacks of BOOKS, WRITING MATERIALS in the cell. TWO GUARDS wait, shackles in hand. 
MARCUS has no interest in scripture. He blows a cloud of SMOKE which drifts in the direction of the PRIEST, who blinks and shuts his bible. 
One of the GUARDS unlocks the cell door for-- 
DR. SERENA KOGAN. She's in her 30's-50's, brilliant, attractive, but thin and pale, a scarf tied around her head. She carries a CLIPBOARD. The PRIEST backs off to give her some privacy with Marcus. 
SERENA Marcus-- I'm Doctor Serena Kogan, I'm with Project Angel. You consented to donate your body to science... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS Yeah, I'm pretty much done with it. 
SERENA You've been chosen for our research. 
MARCUS Chosen?    Lucky me. 
SERENA We just need a couple of signatures... 
Marcus sits up, she passes him the clipboard and pen-- he notes that her hands are SHAKING. 
MARCUS You don't need to be scared. 
SERENA I'm not.    It's nerve degeneration. 
MARCUS looks up from the form, takes in the scarf covering her sparse hair. 
MARCUS Cancer? 
SERENA (NODS) You're not the only one with a death sentence. 
MARCUS meets her eyes.      She studies him a beat. 
SERENA (cont'd) What you're doing is important, Marcus. Our work is still highly experimental... but you may be helping people in ways you can't begin to imagine. 
MARCUS I'm a regular hero. 
With that sarcastic comment, he SIGNS HIS NAME-- we see the words "PROJECT ANGEL" at the top of DENSE TYPE on the form. 
SERENA takes the clipboard, starts to rise.         She touches his hand for a moment. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SERENA Thank you.     And... I'm sorry. 
MARCUS No one lives forever. 
THE GUARD sees SERENA out. 
INT.   DEATH ROW/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
LOW ANGLE - MARCUS' CHAINED ANKLES clank as the GUARDS lead him down the corridor, past PRISONERS in their cells; some avert their eyes, others give a nod or raise a fist. 
PRIEST (V.O.) Marcus, this is your last opportunity to make a confession... 
MARCUS stares straight ahead, taking deep, steady breaths, struggling not to succumb to fear. 
PRIEST (V.O.) (cont'd) Is there nothing you would say to Officer Martinez' family? 
INT.   DEATH ROW/EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT 
CLOSE - BUCKLES TIGHTEN... AN ALCOHOL SWAB on MARCUS' FOREARM... A NEEDLE punctures his skin. 
BOY (CASUALLY) Terminators-- T-400s.   What is this stuff? 
THE BOY unfolds the paper scraps in the LANTERN LIGHT-- 
ANGLE ON PAPER SCRAPS - the WOMAN'S FACE from the poster, a fragment of a MODEL'S PHOTO from a MAGAZINE AD, a painting of a FEMALE FACE from a PAPERBACK COVER. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
THE BOY looks puzzled, intrigued by the pictures. But with sudden speed, MARCUS GRABS THE BOY'S GUN HAND and wrenches it hard-- it FIRES into the air. MARCUS gets control of the gun, wraps one arm around the boy's throat. 
MARCUS If I'm not in hell, where am I?! 
BOY (CHOKING) Texas! 
The NOISE of a SHOTGUN PUMPING close behind MARCUS-- 
MARCUS spins to face his attacker, pressing the handgun into the boy's cheek. He's face to face with-- 
A GIRL, a couple of years younger than the BOY, training the shotgun at Marcus' head-- she looks ready to shoot. 
GIRL Let him go! 
MARCUS First put down the shotgun. 
THE GIRL shakes her head angrily.   She wears an aged, beloved BASEBALL CAP with a STAR on it. 
BOY Do what he says. 
GIRL He'll kill us both! 
MARCUS I don't wanna kill anyone. 
BOY Do it, Star. Put it down. 
She shakes her head slightly, aiming carefully at Marcus' head, just a few feet away, a slight smile on her face. 
GIRL There was only one bullet in that gun. 
MARCUS hooks his foot around the oil lantern and deftly-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
--BOOTS IT at the GIRL. BURNING OIL spills across her leg, she cries out and fumbles the shotgun. MARCUS tosses the BOY at her, the two of them SPRAWL on the ground, the shotgun falling to one side-- 
MARCUS quickly snatches up the shotgun. 
Using SNOW, the BOY helps the GIRL extinguish the flames from her clothing. 
MARCUS stands over the kids with a gun in each hand.   He struggles to control anger, speaks quietly. 
MARCUS I don't like it when people point guns at me. 
GIRL It wasn't loaded. 
MARCUS quickly checks the chambers of both the shotgun and handgun-- indeed, both are empty. 
MARCUS You took on a guy like me with one bullet and an empty shotgun? (studies them admiringly) Pretty stupid. 
He shoves the handgun in his belt, puts the shotgun down and kneels to pick up fallen scraps of paper-- a few have caught FIRE and are incinerated. 
THE BOY and GIRL get to their feet, stare at Marcus. 
GIRL Can I have my gun back? 
MARCUS shrugs, gestures for her to pick it up.   He still looks at the PICTURES in his hands. 
GIRL (cont'd) Where'd you get those? 
MARCUS In the city. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
BOY (steps away from him) The city? Oh man. That place is red hot. 
MARCUS (a small smile) Seemed kinda dead to me. 
BOY No-- radiation. 
A SPOTLIGHT appears in the distance-- a ROVING HUNTER-KILLER moving in their direction. 
Quickly, automatically, the kids dive for cover behind a WALL OF DEBRIS. MARCUS looks toward the LIGHT, unaware of danger. 
ONE AEROSTAT patrols the area. It's a surveillance drone the size of a softball, shiny steel, an inset camera lens with a RED GLOW. It flies in a geometric pattern, hovering every few seconds before continuing on. It vanishes around the corner of the fast-food joint, moving in the direction of the motel. STAR has been timing its moves. 
STAR Now! 
KYLE and STAR dash for the fast-food entrance, MARCUS just behind. They round the doorway and-- 
INT.   FAST FOOD JOINT - DAY 
--drop down inside behind an upended table in what was once a taco place, remnants of Mexican decor. 
THROUGH A DIRTY WINDOW, they see the AEROSTAT buzz past, flying its pattern. It moves on without spotting them, then takes off in a new direction. 
KYLE and STAR set to searching the place, something they've done many times. They go through trash cans, check behind the counters and in the kitchen. MARCUS gets up, still looking out the windows. 
MARCUS That flying grapefruit, what was it? 
KYLE Aerostat-- one of Skynet's eyes. They patrol places like this, looking for survivors. 
STAR Yes! 
She's come up with some UNOPENED PACKETS OF CONDIMENTS from a bag of TRASH. KYLE trots over. 
KYLE Any red ones? 
She nods excitedly, hands him a packet.    He tears it open, sucks down the contents eagerly. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KYLE (cont'd) Mm.    Ketchup. 
STAR discards one packet, sucks at another-- and immediately makes a pained face and tosses the packet aside. 
STAR Yuk! 
MARCUS picks up the packet, looks at it. 
MARCUS Jalape√±o sauce. 
STAR and KYLE pause in their eating, stare at him. 
STAR You can read. 
MARCUS shrugs modestly. 
KYLE So can I. (off Star's look) Well, sort of... a little. 
With obvious reluctance, STAR holds a packet of mustard toward Marcus. 
STAR Want some? 
Marcus gallantly waves it away. 
MARCUS No thanks.     Not hungry. 
KYLE Never heard anyone say that before. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   ABANDONED MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
ANGLE IN MIRROR - MARCUS stares at his own reflection in a cracked MIRROR. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS I look the same. 
STAR closes tattered curtains, plops on the bare bed, ready for sleep. The room's a mess, GRAFFITI here and there, trash scattered about; they're not the first squatters who've been here. THE GUNS and STAR'S WATCH lie on a dresser. 
KYLE sits before the TV-- he's scratching STICK FIGURES onto the screen with a rusted POCKETKNIFE. One is clearly meant to be him; the smaller one, wearing a baseball cap, is Star. 
KYLE You ever watch television? 
MARCUS Oh yeah. Was about all I ever had to look forward to in the joint. 
STAR (YAWNING) What's a joint? 
MARCUS (BLINKS) Prison. Spent half my life there. 
KYLE I remember TV a little.   Cartoons. It was great. 
KYLE plops on the bed next to STAR, who's already out. MARCUS studies them. 
MARCUS She your sister? 
KYLE We oughta find a place to hole up for the day... 
MARCUS pounds on the TANKER-- a deep echo. 
MARCUS Damn it.    Empty. 
KYLE sniffs the air. 
KYLE You smell that? 
STAR sniffs the air herself, eyes going wide. 
STAR Food! 
They both hop out of the Jeep, running toward the GARAGE, each carrying their unloaded GUNS. 
HIGH ANGLE - from BEHIND THE RUSTING SIGN, an AEROSTAT appears, aimed at the kids, LIGHTS BLINKING. 
INT.   SERVICE STATION - DAWN 
KYLE and STAR slither under a partially open GARAGE DOOR. The space is dark, SMOKE-FILLED... STRIPS OF DRIED MEAT hang from the hydraulic lift. The two youths look amazed and delighted. Kyle shoves the gun into his waistband, moves to the closest strip and PEELS OFF A PIECE, takes a tentative bite, then gnaws ravenously. Star leans the shotgun against the wall and follows suit. 
MARCUS lifts the garage door and enters, DAWN LIGHT streaming in behind him. 
MARCUS What is this? 
KYLE (mouth full) Who cares? 
Marcus squints at something in the darkness.   He takes a step forward, then grabs Star's arm. 
MARCUS Spit it out! 
STAR (CHEWING) It's good! 
Now KYLE reacts to what Marcus saw, GAGS and SPITS out meat. He's staring at-- 
--a dried, severed HUMAN HAND, resting on a GRILLE in the sunken SERVICE PIT, where a CHARCOAL FIRE smolders. 
Star sees it too, turns and RETCHES, just as-- 
--three animal-like CANNIBALS emerge from the back of the garage-- two burly, ugly, unshaven MEN and a wild-eyed, unhealthy-looking WOMAN with matted hair. We'll call them PIG, BULL and COW. PIG grabs the SHOTGUN, BULL grabs KYLE and yanks the HANDGUN from his waistband. 
COW grabs STAR, shoves her into the center of the garage, beside Kyle and Bull. Bull tosses the handgun to COW who keeps it trained on the kids, sizing them up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
COW Not much meat on `em. 
PIG eyes Marcus, points the shotgun in his face. 
PIG This one's fi-i-ine-- 
MARCUS raises two fingers like a peace sign-- then shoves them into the barrels of the shotgun. PIG snorts and PULLS THE TRIGGER-- CLICK. 
MARCUS Oops. 
MARCUS yanks the gun away and tosses it aside, HEAD-BUTTS Pig, who staggers backward, BLOOD SPRAYING from his nose. 
COW points the unloaded HANDGUN at Marcus-- CLICK CLICK. 
KYLE and STAR get free of BULL and dash for the exit, they're out of there in a flash. 
BULL CHARGES MARCUS, who dodges him, grabs the man and-- 
--HURLS HIM HEAD FIRST into the CHARCOAL PIT-- his BODY SIZZLES against the coals, he SCREAMS and WRITHES. 
COW picks up an AXE with two hands and SWINGS it at MARCUS who GRABS the HANDLE with one hand and YANKS it away. 
COW knows she's met her match, turns and flees, heading out the way Kyle and Star went. 
MARCUS advances on PIG and BULL, brandishing the AXE. Pig squirms back across the floor, wiping BLOOD from his face. 
PIG We didn't kill `em! I swear to God, they was dead already, we wasn't gonna let `em rot-- 
BULL has scrambled out of the coal pit, but is in too much pain to rise. 
BULL Go `head, take as much as you want, we're on the same side here-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Marcus looks ready to finish them off-- but reacts to CRIES from outside, a loud MECHANICAL RUMBLE. 
A PAIR OF A-10 WARTHOGS-- the same colorful ground attack aircraft we saw in the first battle-- ROAR PAST on either side of the transport. 
THE CRIPPLED HARVESTER topples off the side of the transport, still clutching MARCUS and-- 
--CATCHES on an ENGINE POD, the creature and Marcus both suspended in the air. THE HARVESTER ROASTS in the ENGINE BLAST, its CPU finally dies. Marcus is suspended below the engine, the steel limb RELEASES HIM, he has to cling to it now, to keep from falling. 
The HUNTER-KILLERS peel out in pursuit of the two Resistance planes. 
A DOGFIGHT ensues between the much larger, more heavily armored H-Ks, and the smaller, more maneuverable WARTHOGS. CANNON FIRE CATCHES an H-K but has no effect. The H-Ks' BLUE PLASMA PULSES barely miss the planes, which loop and bank. 
An AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE STREAKS from a WARTHOG and BLASTS the ENGINE of an H-K. AN EXPLOSION, the thing starts flying erratically, heading downward and-- 
--CRASHING to earth in a glorious FIREBALL. 
EXT.   AERIAL & RIVER - DAY 
The planes are nearing a RIVER, bordered by sickly TREES. On the far banks, even from above, we see ominous MILITARY FORTIFICATIONS-- CONCRETE BUNKERS, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS, etc. 
MARCUS meanwhile, is trying to climb up the dead Harvester, avoid the ENGINE BLAST and find a handhold on the transport. 
THE A-10 that shot down the H-K comes around for another pass at the transport, but-- 
--ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUNS at the far side of the river let out a VOLLEY of BLUE PLASMA-FIRE. The BURSTS arc toward the A-10, which swerves and climbs, but-- 
--PLASMA FIRE destroys a wing, the A-10 SPINS out of control. 
THE OTHER A-10 breaks off its dogfight with its H-K and speeds away from the river. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS is tantalizingly close to the upper lip of the transport, he reaches out and-- 
--THE FRIED HARVESTER suddenly dislodges from the ENGINE POD, taking Marcus with it, into FREEFALL. 
WITH MARCUS, plummeting downward toward earth, a hundred feet below, the transport continuing on its way above, crossing the river. 
MARCUS' POV - the ground and treetops getting closer. At the last moment, his continuing forward momentum takes him OVER THE RIVER and-- 
MARCUS and the DEAD HARVESTER HIT THE WATER, hard, vanishing below the surface with enormous SPLASHES. 
The surviving H-K and the TRANSPORT continue across the river into Skynet territory, vanishing in the distance. 
CAMERA MOVES to FIND a PARACHUTE, drifting earthward on the unfortified side of the river. 
EXT.   RIVERBANK - DUSK 
HOLD ON LAPPING WATER for a beat.      Then-- 
--MARCUS breaks the surface, staggering toward shore, he drops to his knees in the shallows. 
WAKES APPEAR behind him. Hearing the water stir, Marcus turns to see numerous DARK SHAPES moving rapidly in on him, from different directions, FLASHES OF METAL visible beneath the surface. These are HYDROBOTS-- AQUATIC TERMINATORS-- but we don't get a good look at them (yet) and Marcus isn't sticking around. He scrambles for the riverbank and makes his way into the leafless trees. 
EXT.   TREES - EVENING 
MARCUS moves past the trunks of bare trees, pauses, looks over the water in the direction the transport took. 
BLAIR (O.S.) Yo!   Up here! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLAIR WILLIAMS, the helmeted pilot who ejected, hangs from the tangled remains of her parachute, caught in the trees about fifteen feet in the air above Marcus. 
MARCUS moves closer.    Blair struggles to saw through her lines with a KNIFE. 
BLAIR (cont'd) Who are you-- 
The LINES suddenly SNAP, Blair FALLS from the tree. 
Marcus' reflexes are fast as ever, he's beneath her in an instant and CATCHES HER. He holds her in his arms: 
MARCUS Name's Marcus. 
BLAIR You can put me down now, Marcus. 
He does so. Blair pulls off her helmet, her hair is short. She's in her 20s, pretty, petite but strong, a no-nonsense, battle-hardened member of the Resistance. She pulls a COMPASS from her flight suit, consults it briefly as she orients herself. 
BLAIR (cont'd) I've got an ELT, but I can't call for a rescue here. There's an outpost a few miles upriver-- not my favorite people in the world, but it's safe. Let's move. 
Blair is already moving, Marcus hesitates, then points across the water. 
MARCUS I'm heading that way. 
BLAIR (cont'd) Levels are tolerable now, but just. We can't spend the night here. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
They start moving again.   Marcus pauses, listens: 
MARCUS What was that? 
BLAIR I didn't hear anything-- 
Now they both hear an eerie HOWL, changing in pitch-- like a coyote on crack. More than one picks up the CHORUS. 
BLAIR (cont'd) Skindogs. 
She pulls a SIDEARM, holds it at the ready as she starts running, away from the direction of the noise. Marcus keeps up at her side, looking behind them. 
WITH THE DOGS 
We don't get a good look at them, but there's a pack of large BEASTS moving quickly through the undergrowth, gaining on the fleeing humans. 
BLAIR sees they won't outrun them. She spins, FIRES in the direction of the approaching PACK. Suddenly it's quiet-- the animals fan out, forming a circle around Blair and Marcus. 
MARCUS They're surrounding us. 
QUICK SHOTS of MUTANT EYES, glowing in the dark-- ENLARGED TEETH-- DARK, MASSIVE FORMS moving through the brush. 
BLAIR They're smart. And they don't scare easy. 
After a few tense beats, from the foliage-- 
A SKINDOG leaps at BLAIR from behind-- it's hideous, the size of a Great Dane, hairless, with veiny, wrinkled skin and long, catlike CLAWS. Before Blair can react, MARCUS leaps between her and the dog, grabs the slavering creature by the throat. It SNAPS its ELONGATED TEETH at him, but he manages to BREAK its neck and hurl it toward-- 
TWO MORE SKINDOGS moving in for an attack. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
BLAIR FIRES a few SHOTS at the encroaching pack, we hear a few YELPS-- 
MARCUS protects her, effortlessly tosses a few more SKINDOGS aside, ignoring vicious bites and scratches. 
The other SKINDOGS turn on dead and injured pack members, begin TEARING INTO THEM. There's an opening now, the two humans make a run for it. 
BLAIR catches her breath, looking him over, seriously impressed by his strength and calm. 
BLAIR (cont'd) You saved my ass. Thanks. 
MARCUS shrugs, turns back to see the feeding frenzy. 
MARCUS Dog eat dog world. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.   NORMAL FOREST - NIGHT 
It's darker now, the moon is down. MARCUS and BLAIR move gingerly-- she TRIPS, he catches her before she falls. 
BLAIR Thanks. 
BLAIR sighs, yawns, sits against a tree. 
BLAIR (cont'd) It's not far, but we'll never get across the mine field at night. Might as well STAF till morning. 
MARCUS nods, sits a few feet away from her. 
BLAIR (cont'd) C'mere, it's cold. I don't bite. 
MARCUS slides toward her, she nestles against him. 
MARCUS Staf?   What's that mean? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BLAIR It's a resistance term.    Sit tight and fuck. 
Soon they're kissing passionately.      But MARCUS pulls away, rolls onto his back. 
BLAIR (cont'd) You holding out for lipstick? Lingerie? Or am I not your... type? 
MARCUS I'm not gay. In prison, I thought about puss-- women all the time. But now... it's not working. Who knows, all those years on ice... 
BLAIR Maybe it's just gonna take some time. Before you're completely thawed out. 
INT.   OUTPOST/BARRACKS & COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY 
DARK. We hear BABIES CRYING from nearby, FUMBLING in the dark, muttered CURSES-- then a MATCH lights a CANDLE. BARNES, 20-ish, good-looking and cocky, yawns and sneers, annoyed at being awakened. TWO WOMEN share his mattress. 
BARNES Somebody feed those things! 
MORRISON Start up the generator, Barnes. 
MORRISON is bearded, long-haired, bleary-eyed, a middle-aged man in charge here. He sits up in bed, also beside A COUPLE OF WOMEN. This place has become an underground crash pad, communal living for about a dozen people-- Morrison and Barnes the only men, four or five WOMEN and quite a few CHILDREN of varying age. 
BARNES grunts, yanks the blanket off his bedmates, who CRY OUT in protest. He wraps it around himself, carries the candle as he steps around other SLEEPING FIGURES, makes his way toward a METAL STAIRCASE winding downward. Moments later, we hear a GAS ENGINE start up-- LIGHTS flicker on. 
The place is pretty grimy and run-down, but it was once a military environment. There's a BANK OF TV MONITORS against one wall, which COME TO LIFE. A couple of the WOMEN move toward the adjacent NURSERY AREA to tend to the babies-- one of them, LISA, moves to the TV MONITORS. She squints at one. 
LISA We got company! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ON A SCREEN 
MARCUS and BLAIR in the exact positions we last saw them, looking exhausted. They CRY OUT, unheard. 
EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - DAY 
BARNES pokes his head up from a concealed TRAPDOOR thirty yards from BLAIR and MARCUS, who are hoarse from shouting. 
BARNES Blair? Good to see you. (off her glare) What's the password? 
BLAIR Eat shit and die, Barnes! 
BARNES Close enough. Who's your friend? 
BLAIR Could you get us outta here please? 
BARNES Kinda dumb-ass, wandering around in a mine field. 
BLAIR You didn't maintain the perimeter! Where are your sentries? 
BARNES It's too early for that military crap. 
BARNES consults a MAP, turning it to orient himself. 
BARNES (cont'd) OK, if you keep walking straight you're gonna get blown all to hell... turn to your left and take, oh... five steps. 
BLAIR and MARCUS obey, moving cautiously. 
BARNES (cont'd) OK, face me now. Three steps. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
They do as told. 
BARNES (cont'd) Almost home. Turn to your right and take another five steps... 
They slowly pace five steps.      On the fifth one, there's a CLICK beneath Marcus' foot-- 
A horrified moment of eye contact between him and Blair-- she DIVES TO THE GROUND, away from him as-- 
BOOM!   MARCUS is thrown through the air by the EXPLOSION-- 
MARCUS' BODY lands a few feet from the trap door. 
INT.    OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - DAY 
Frantic action-- the unconscious MARCUS is carried down a corridor from the open trap door by BARNES, MORRISON and a couple of women, NANCY and LISA. BLAIR, bleeding from shrapnel injuries, assists. She yells at BARNES: 
BLAIR You goddamn idiot! 
BARNES He was takin' bigger steps! 
MORRISON Son of a bitch is heavy. 
INT.    OUTPOST/INFIRMARY - DAY 
MARCUS is deposited gingerly on a METAL TABLE in this crude MEDICAL AREA. Numerous INFANTS and TODDLERS about. 
JANE, a doctor, moves toward MARCUS with scissors and other medical tools, cuts away a tattered pants leg, the shreds of his sneaker. She stops and stares, palpates a BLACKENED LEG briefly. She looks up in alarm. 
JANE He stepped on a Claymore? This guy oughta be in a hundred pieces... 
(CONTINUED)

(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
KID It's awake! 
INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - DAY 
BLAIR is first to reach the edge of the silo, horrified at the sight of the dangling MARCUS. BARNES keeps the RPG trained on him, they shout over each other. 
MARCUS Get me the hell down from here! 
BARNES Shut up!   I told you to shut up! 
BLAIR Leave him alone! (turning away from him) Marcus, I'm so sorry... 
MORRISON and the OTHERS join them, eyes fixed on Marcus. 
BARNES It keeps talkin' at me. God this thing gives me the creeps. 
MARCUS Why are you doing this?    What is this place? 
MORRISON We're trying to-- 
NANCY (over him) Don't say anything!     It's probably uplinked to Skynet. 
Morrison puts a hand on her arm. 
MORRISON Then it's already too late. (to Marcus) This used to be an ICBM silo, we're just trying to stay alive here. Your turn-- where'd you come from? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS Corpus Christi. It's in Texas.     Or it was. 
BARNES (AMAZED) It sounds completely human... it really could pass. 
JANE Didn't John Connor say they'd start building things like this? 
MORRISON Not yet-- not for years. (to Marcus) So, you're programmed with false memories, a human history-- 
MARCUS What are you talking about? 
MORRISON You can skip the act, we know what you are. 
NANCY Why are you even speaking to it?! 
BARNES She's right, let's just waste the damn thing-- 
NANCY It'll kill us all if we give it a CHANCE-- 
During the above, other KIDS and ADULTS IN BG AD LIB-- "Kill it," "Goddamn robot," etc.-- increasing mob anger, until-- 
MARCUS I'm a man! 
His impassioned CRY silences the onlookers.       He speaks more quietly, desperately: 
MARCUS (cont'd) Even if I never been treated like one. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) MARCUS (cont'd) Year after year after year on death row, I just wanted it to end! I cut my own wrists. But they nursed me back to health, `cause that wouldn't be fair, they needed to kill me themselves. For Chrissake, you all want me dead so bad-- just do it. (a scream) Do it! 
His CRY ECHOES through the silo. The CHILDREN cower behind the adults. BLAIR is genuinely moved by his plight. 
BARNES hefts the RPG, looks toward MORRISON-- "should I?" Morrison seems torn, about to give the order-- 
LISA rushes in from the communications area, breathless, amazed by her own news: 
LISA Regional got through to CLA-- they want us to rig a video feed. (gesturing at Marcus) He wants to see him. 
MORRISON Who does? 
LISA John Connor. 
They all seem astonished-- this has gone right to the top. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   OUTPOST/COMMUNICATIONS AREA - DAY 
MARCUS sits impatiently in a wooden chair, facing a VIDEO CAMERA and a MICROPHONE. BARNES trains an RPG at his head while MORRISON finishes PADLOCKING HEAVY CHAINS to the BOLTS in Marcus' arms and legs-- these attach to a nearby STEEL POST. BLAIR stands nearby. LISA fumbles nervously with the TRANSMITTER, plugging in wires. 
MARCUS So this guy is what, like king of the world, or what's left of it? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CONNOR (cont'd) Kate, why did I become leader of the Resistance? 
KATE Because people trust you... you give them faith-- 
CONNOR No. Because I knew I would be, I was told. I know when and where the major battles are going to take place. I know I'm going to send my own father back through time to save my mother-- even though I haven't met him yet. Christ, I even know the year I'm going to die... 
KATE JOHN-- 
CONNOR So how could I not know about this?! 
He BANGS HIS FIST on the table atop the PAPERS. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR & LAUNCH TUBE - DAY 
MARCUS is marched down the corridor to the launch tube, Frankenstein-like, MORRISON holding the chains, keeping a safe distance from him, while BARNES keeps the RPG trained at Marcus' head. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Marcus shuffles awkwardly, the bolts hampering his ankles. It's reminiscent of his death walk at film's opening. 
MARCUS Feels like I been here before... what are you gonna do to me? 
MORRISON Nothing. Los Angeles is sending a chopper-- seems you're some kind of VIP. 
They reach the edge of the SILO PIT-- a long drop, smooth walls, a long METAL LADDER leading down into darkness. MARCUS pauses by the ladder, holds up his bolted arms questioningly-- "now what?" 
At a look from Morrison, he and Barnes BODY-CHECK MARCUS at once, sending him flying over the edge-- 
MARCUS FALLS the thirty feet or so, strikes the concrete FLOOR of the launch tube with a sickening THUD, the CHAINS clattering down around him. 
MARCUS is stunned, barely conscious as the LADDER is PULLED UPWARD. It's like the bottom of a well, twenty feet in diameter, sheer concrete walls, the floor BLACKENED from a rocket blast. 
ANGLE UP - his captors look down at him for a moment, then move out of view. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   TRANSPORT - NIGHT 
CAMERA MOVES past the PRISONERS, a couple dozen total... An HISPANIC COUPLE huddle against one wall, whispering to each other IN SPANISH... COW rocks in despair, head in her hands, BULL and PIG mutter to each other nearby... an OLDER WOMAN prays, going through rosary beads... FIND STAR and KYLE. She's watching as KYLE uses his pocket knife to CARVE an image in the wall of the transport. He looks up. 
KYLE We're stopping. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The BACK PANEL rolls upward. CONTROL ROBOTS-- reminiscent of the treaded T-1s but without the heavy weaponry-- flank a path from the rear of the transport towards BRIGHT LIGHT up a RAMP a short distance away. 
THE PRISONERS instinctively move away from the robots, moving to the front of the container... until ZZZAP! BLUE ENERGY crackles across the floor. THE PRISONERS CRY OUT in pain at the electrified surface, and dash toward the opening at the rear, leaping out of the container. 
LOW ANGLE, as the prisoners run by, we hold a moment on Kyle's graffiti-- it's the STICK FIGURE IMAGES of KYLE and STAR we saw before, they both hold hands with a LARGER STICK FIGURE who stands between them, meant to be MARCUS. 
INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT 
THE CONTAINER has stopped in a large subterranean space. There are numerous FUTURISTIC VEHICLES here-- hydrogen CARS, three-wheeled ATVs, electric BUSES. CONTROL `BOTS closest to the container start to close in on the huddling PRISONERS. 
A ROBOT BUMPS into BULL, sending another JOLT OF ELECTRICITY through his body, like a cattle prod. Everyone gets the picture, starts hurrying down the line, the ROBOTS closing around them. 
COW looks around nervously, clearly freaking out.   Spotting a gap between the robots, she bolts-- 
--a ROBOT SWIVELS and CUTS HER DOWN with an ENERGY BLAST. She lies still, SMOKE rising from her body. 
The other PRISONERS pick up the pace. 
STAR I'm scared. 
KYLE (hugging her) Whatever happens, we stick together. 
The LIGHT emanates from FROSTED WINDOWS at the top of the RAMP, through which we make out the SILHOUETTES of human figures. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GLASS DOORS part ahead of the prisoners-- a stark white, sterile environment beyond. THE ROBOTS stop here. THE PRISONERS disappear inside... and the DOORS CLOSE. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT 
BARNES remains on guard duty with the RPG, propped up on some cushions, a LANTERN by his side-- it's pretty late, the generator's shut down. He's reading an old, yellowed COMIC BOOK, he has a small stack at his side. 
MARCUS You think they'll buy that? 
BLAIR Worth a shot. (looking at him) Marcus, Command wants to take you apart, cut open your head. One thing I know, you're alive-- and you've got a right to live. 
THE BUZZING SAW BLADE sound-bridges to: 
EXT.   FOREST CLEARING - NIGHT 
THE WHIR OF CHOPPER BLADES. A SPOTLIGHT shines over the low growth in the minefield as a BLACKHAWK HELICOPTER circles, coming in for a landing. WEAPONS RACKS are jury-rigged beside the spotlight, the chopper bristles with AUTOMATED CANNONS, MISSILES and NAPALM TANKS. 
THE SPOTLIGHT picks out the CONCRETE and STEEL CAP of the LAUNCH TUBE. 
INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT 
THE SAW finishes cutting the BOLT between Marcus' legs; his arms are already free. The BUZZING cuts out, but now they hear the CHOPPER LANDING directly overhead. 
BLAIR They're already here for you-- 
MARCUS slides the BOLTS out of his legs, freeing himself from the chains. 
BLAIR (cont'd) Hide in the forest, then aim west for open country-- 
MARCUS I'm heading across the river. 
BLAIR No human being can survive there-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS I'm not human, remember? 
BLAIR You're gonna try and save those kids. 
MARCUS It's the only thing I can think of that makes any sense... 
BLAIR Marcus, for all you know, they're dead already-- 
MARCUS For all I know, they're the reason I'm back from the dead. 
BLAIR studies him a moment, no changing his mind. But she admires him. She starts up the ladder, MARCUS following. 
BARNES is still passed out as BLAIR and MARCUS ascend to the platform around the pit. They move to the sliding door-- 
BLAIR starts to open it, but sees a LIGHT and hears VOICES and FOOTSTEPS at the far end, SLIDES IT SHUT again. 
BLAIR Damn it, we're too late-- 
MARCUS Where's that go? 
MARCUS points to a LARGE VENTILATION FAN behind STEEL GRATING, eight feet above them, on the far side of the pit. It's not running, but there's no way to get through it. 
BLAIR Should lead out, but there's no way past the fan-- 
MARCUS is already picking up the RPG-- but he points it backwards, has no idea how to shoot it-- 
BLAIR grins, grabs the RPG from him-- then braces herself, takes aim and FIRES-- 
KABOOM!   The EXPLOSION rips OPEN the GRATE, destroys the FAN. 
INT.   OUTPOST/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
MORRISON escorts a pair of powerful UNIFORMED SOLDIERS armed with HIGH-TECH RIFLES with explosive shells-- they react to the EXPLOSION beyond the closed door-- and break into a run, the soldiers readying their weapons. 
INT.   OUTPOST/LAUNCH TUBE - NIGHT 
MARCUS and BLAIR have moved around the narrow walkway to the far end of the pit, beneath the SMOKING HOLE. Blair thinks of something, pulls a small DEVICE from her flight suit, the size of a pack of cigarettes, holds it toward Marcus. 
BLAIR Here. My ELT-- emergency locator transmitter. If you find the camp, activate it like this. It could really help the Resistance. 
She indicates a button.     MARCUS takes the device-- 
--then grabs her, KISSES HER hard on the mouth-- she's startled-- it felt very human. 
MARCUS Thank you. 
MARCUS grabs the sharp, still smoking STEEL projecting from the hole and pulls himself upward as-- 
THE DOOR SLIDES OPEN and the SOLDIERS open FIRE at MARCUS-- 
BLAIR hits the deck as EXPLOSIVE SHELLS tear HOLES in the CONCRETE-- 
--SHRAPNEL hits MARCUS in the back, he's thrown into the ventilation shaft-- 
INT.   VENTILATION SHAFT - NIGHT 
MARCUS emerges, the FLAMES still visible on the other side of the river, behind him. He doesn't look back, as he moves into Skynet turf. This side of the river isn't wooded, everything has a concrete, industrial feel. Marcus is a mess, both clothing and skin are shredded and charred. 
He nearly bumps into a SKELETAL STEEL TERMINATOR, which emerges from behind a concrete wall. The terminator trains its PLASMA RIFLE on MARCUS, scans him, RED EYES glowing... (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
TERMINATOR'S POV - RED FILTER, MARCUS' FORM is TARGETED. READ-OUTS on the side, the HIGHLIGHTED WORDS "NON-ORGANIC - DO NOT TERMINATE." 
THE TERMINATOR turns from MARCUS, no longer interested, moving off on its preprogrammed patrol. 
MARCUS moves up a sloping, CONCRETE EMBANKMENT.   At the top of the rise, he sees, spread out before him-- 
EXT.   SKYNET TERRITORY - DAY 
--a hideous industrial sprawl, OPEN GAS FLAMES, SMOKING FACTORIES, rumbling VEHICLES, H-Ks, TERMINATOR TROOPS on patrol. Nothing green, a GREY HAZE hangs over the landscape. 
After a moment, MARCUS shakes his head and gamely soldiers on, moving along the edge of the elevated embankment. 
EXT.   SKYNET PERIPHERY - DAY 
MARCUS moves past banks of ANTI-AIRCRAFT guns and MISSILE LAUNCHERS, interspersed with slowly rotating RADAR TRACKING DISHES-- the first line of defense. From this fortress-like wall he descends into the nightmarish environment beyond. 
MARCUS reacts to a CAWING SOUND above, looks up to see-- 
--A CROW perching on an overhead WIRE.   A second later-- 
ZAP! A BLUE PLASMA PULSE blasts the thing to smithereens, a few BLACK FEATHERS drift down as-- 
--a T-400 (same mask-like face we saw earlier) lowers its plasma weapon and strolls on. Target practice. 
MARCUS stays out of the way of the TERMINATOR LEGIONS patrolling near the riverside. 
EXT.   DEMOLITION SITE - DAY 
MARCUS heads inland, past the ruins of a CHURCH-- WALLS with the remains of stained glass WINDOWS, STATUES OF SAINTS. Hearing RUMBLING NOISES, Marcus hurries out of the way as-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A WALL collapses, pushed down by an automated SKYNET BULLDOZER. This gigantic, self-operated construction machine has a swivelling CAMERA HEAD instead of a cab. Its giant TREADS roll over the STONE STATUES, crushing them to dust. 
EXT.   CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 
MARCUS keeps moving into Skynet's turf. The demolition gives way to massive CONSTRUCTION, as the robots remake the human world in their own image. 
CONSTRUCTION ROBOTS erect a low-slung STEEL FRAME structure, automated CRANES and SUPPLY TRUCKS about. These robots are oversized versions of the steel terminators we know, but with multiple limbs bearing WELDING TOOLS, and TREADS instead of legs. Marcus watches as BEAMS are quickly welded into place by telescoping steel arms. 
EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY 
MARCUS continues into the completed robot city. Skynet's ARCHITECTURE is featureless, bland, purely practical: single- story, windowless CONCRETE or STEEL structures with massive open DOORWAYS to accommodate their largest machines. A RED GLOW emanates from the interiors, the robots' preferred lighting scheme. No sidewalks or signs, just thick GRIDS of POWER LINES and PIPES overhead. Constant NOISE of BUZZING POWER, RATTLING MACHINES, etc. 
MARCUS steps inside one of these buildings-- 
INT.   TERMINATOR FACTORY - DAY 
This TERMINATOR ASSEMBLY PLANT is an intricate, multi-leveled clockwork maze of moving CONVEYORS and INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS. 
ELECTRONICS and HYDRAULICS are ROBOTICALLY SOLDERED in place. STEEL PRESSES stamp out TERMINATOR PARTS-- TORSOS, FACE PLATES, SPINAL COLUMNS, LIMBS. 
Partially-completed PARTS are moved by CONVEYOR to ASSEMBLY STATIONS, where LIMBS and HEADS are JOINED to TORSOS, elaborate OPERATIONS carried out by INDUSTRIAL ROBOTS, like the ones in present-day factories. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SYNTHETIC SKIN is SPRAYED OVER a METAL ENDOSKELETON in precise amounts, building up to create human features... this is a T-400. 
An INDUSTRIAL ROBOT ARM picks up a CPU from a DRY-ICE CONTAINER. The CPU features the distinctive, linked rectangles familiar from the earlier films. The arm lifts this gingerly to a TERMINATOR SKELETON and INSERTS IT into the STEEL SKULL, SCREWING A SEAL over the hole. 
THE RED EYES flicker to life, and THE ARMATURE releases the TERMINATOR, which moves away under its own power. It removes a PLASMA WEAPON from a WALL RACK, moving past-- 
--the dumbfounded MARCUS. 
THE TERMINATOR joins a dozen identical robots, who ride on a treaded SKYNET TANK with a PLASMA CANNON and FLAMETHROWER. There are numerous TANKS here, awaiting deployment. 
EXT.   SKYNET STREET - DAY 
Rounding a corner on a straight, narrow street, MARCUS sees all the ROBOTS and SMALL VEHICLES clearing into small NICHES built into the walls on either side, as if clearing a path for him. It takes him a moment to realize it's not him they're responding to-- a RUMBLE BUILDS... 
A convoy of GIGANTIC SKYNET TRUCKS-- a half-dozen modified SEMIS now driven by CPUS-- bear down on MARCUS at extremely high speed. They carry construction supplies: massive STEEL BEAMS, CONCRETE PIPES, etc. And there's barely inches of clearance on either side. 
These things aren't slowing down. There's nowhere for Marcus to duck out of the way. He has no choice but to RUN, as fast as he can, the lead vehicle gaining on him rapidly. 
MARCUS THROWS HIMSELF to the concrete in the middle of the street, pressing his body flat as the LEAD TRUCK passes over him, the wheels missing him by inches. 
MARCUS Your family. You lost them? 
Jeremy nods and SMILES, looking at him once more. 
MARCUS (cont'd) Why are you smiling? 
JEREMY `Cause I feel good. The interface recognizes negative emotions-- rage, grief, despair-- and stimulates positive endorphins in response. Thank God, life would be pretty unbearable otherwise, don't you think? 
EXT.   PARK - DUSK 
They've left the main street now, driving down a WOODED PATH leading to the "facility." There are lawns, fountains, etc. Marcus SLAMS ON the brakes, then clutches Jeremy by the throat-- the man looks more annoyed than frightened. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS Tell me everything.   How did you people get here? 
JEREMY Most of us worked at NASA or DARPA. I was an engineer on Project Angel-- 
Marcus drags the man from the cart by his throat, squeezing harder. 
MARCUS Angel-- what is it? 
JEREMY Advanced Nexus of Genetic and Electronic Life-forms... A-N-G-E-L. You can stop choking me, it's not like I need to breathe. 
Marcus releases him, but remains in his face.       Jeremy takes a moment to recover his composure. 
JEREMY (cont'd) We replaced the body's hydrocarbons with plastinated compounds while maintaining cellular structure-- analog neural impulses were converted to wireless digital signals, controlling the micro-tech chassis-- 
MARCUS English! 
JEREMY (sighs, slowly) The goal was a superior support system for the human brain-- to go anywhere, do anything-- explore deep space, the bottom of the sea. I specialized in optics. 
He taps his own eye with an audible CLICK, not flinching. Marcus takes a couple steps away, looking at his own hands. 
Jeremy points to nearby BUILDINGS, a little peevish. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JEREMY (cont'd) The facility is just ahead. I'll let them know you're coming. 
So saying, he's back in the cart, pulling away in a hurry.   A moment later, Marcus moves off amongst the trees. 
Nearing the complex, Marcus reacts to BIRDSONG above.   He looks up, stops as he sees-- 
--a TINY SPEAKER, concealed amongst the LEAVES. 
MARCUS moves to this tree, touches it-- the bark feels unnatural. He RAPS it with his FIST-- it sounds hollow, made of FIBERGLAS. He fingers a LEAF, tries to bend it-- PLASTIC. 
He crouches, studying the GRASS. After a moment, he finds a SEAM in the pristine lawn. He starts to peel it up... it's ASTROTURF. Beneath it is SANDY DIRT. 
Marcus KEEPS PEELING the plastic covering back... more dirt-- and BITS OF BONE. As he continues to uncover the ground we see recognizable CHUNKS of SKULLS, LEGBONES, etc. 
By now he's rolled back a few square yards, numb with horror. Marcus moves on toward the complex with new determination, trying to stay out of sight. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   LABORATORY - NIGHT 
ON THE MONITORS above the long row of chambers-- colorful 3-D IMAGES of the prisoner's BRAINS are being constructed, like PET scans. DENSE DIGITAL READ-OUTS BELOW, as data is analyzed. (Levels of seratonin, endorphins, etc.) Beside these are BARCODES and small INSET PHOTOS taken within the chamber, the subjects looking frightened. 
IN THE OPERATING THEATER, the LASERS are still now, their grisly work done for the moment, awaiting the next batch. 
An ENGINEER, a nice-looking, well-built young man in loose black clothing, moves down the row of chambers, studying results. He speaks into a subtle HEAD-SET: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ENGINEER 32578 - acceptable. 32579 - no, insufficient neural capacity. 32580 - eh, this one shouldn't have even been brought here... 
As he speaks, the BARCODES on the monitors in question turn either RED or GREEN in response to his judgments. 
He reaches KYLE'S CHAMBER, we see Kyle's anguished FACE on the monitor photograph. 
ENGINEER (cont'd) 32581 looks good... 
Kyle gets a GREEN BARCODE, the engineer is on to Star, he strokes his chin. 
ENGINEER (cont'd) 32582... hm, borderline. May not be emotionally compatible. Pass. 
On STAR'S MONITOR-- RED BARCODE. 
EXT.   UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
We see now that Connor's on board a NUCLEAR ATTACK SUB, with TWO MORE SUBS moving in tandem behind it. 
HOLD ON the LEAD SUB and MOVE IN ON the STENCILLED NAME as it PASSES CAMERA: "LOS ANGELES SSN-688." 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.   REPAIR LAB - DAY 
START ON MARCUS' DAMAGED LEG. It has been DETACHED from his body, halfway down the thigh. Elaborate CIRCUITS are exposed, as SURGICAL MACHINES perform repairs with LASERS, MECHANICAL ARMS replacing damaged parts. 
NEARBY, MARCUS opens his eyes, coming to. He's CLAMPED onto an elaborate, mobile SURGICAL TABLE, the stump exposed. His body and head are secured within its framework. MORE MACHINES swiftly repair the damage to his chest and shoulder. 
MARCUS twitches, freaking out, struggling in his bonds-- 
THE DETACHED LEG twitches as well. 
SERENA Calm down, Marcus.   It's all right. 
SERENA is on the other side of a GLASS PANEL, operating computer controls. This is an automated surgical environment, the work on Marcus carried out by various MACHINES and MICROTOOLS-- busy HYDRAULIC ARMS, LASERS, etc. 
MARCUS Like fuck it is. I'm sick of being your guinea pig, what are you doing to me now?! (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SERENA Repairing you. 
MARCUS You all work for Skynet! 
SERENA Please. Skynet works for us. It's only a program-- a tool, a means to an end. 
MARCUS The end of the world. 
SERENA Its sole purpose is to protect humanity. 
MARCUS lets out a horrified, bitter laugh. 
SERENA (cont'd) Listen to me. Skynet was designed to detect threats, make projections and implement solutions. As soon as it came on line, it factored in war, disease, environmental destruction-- and calculated a high probability of total human extinction within two hundred years. The human race was doomed... unless we were transformed. 
THE SURGICAL TABLE swivels, bringing MARCUS into alignment with the repaired leg. In moments it's reattached, the plastic skin thermosealed at the joint. 
MARCUS Into-- this? A brain in a box? 
SERENA Skynet had access to the entire defense web-- including Project Angel. It determined hybrids were the only path to salvation. 
MARCUS Destroying the human race in order to save it. 
THE LASER TOOLS and HYDRAULIC ARMS now move on their ceiling racks, coming close to MARCUS' FACE. The TABLE INVERTS, exposing the back of his head. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MARCUS (cont'd) What are you doing? 
SERENA When the resistance attacked our installation, we were forced to self-destruct. We would have taken you with us, but we thought you were in a permanent coma... 
THE LASERS start cutting into the back of Marcus' head, BURNING through the plastic SKIN. MARCUS lets out a CRY of rage, strains at his bonds. 
SERENA (cont'd) Your interface was never installed. 
CLOSE as the HYDRAULIC ARM attaches to the back of Marcus' head and removes a section of STEEL SKULL... 
REVEALING THE SURFACE of a HUMAN BRAIN, gray matter enmeshed in WIRES and CIRCUITRY beneath a clear PLASTIC CASING, in a bath of pale reddish LIQUID. Tiny NEURAL SPARKS fire. 
MARCUS No, stop... I don't want it! You're dead inside, all of you! 
SERENA We're immortal. No sane person would choose to live in pain, forever. Soon you'll understand. 
CLOSE as an elaborate ELECTRONIC INTERFACE MODULE is fixed at the base of Marcus' exposed brain. 
ON MARCUS' FACE - his expression of agony vanishes, his features become peaceful. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT 
MARCUS is dressed in fresh clothes, his damage repaired-- and he seems more at ease than we've yet seen him. He walks beside SERENA, who wears a small EARPIECE, a high-tech cellphone device. They smile as they pass other HYBRIDS on the late shift. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SERENA How are you feeling, Marcus? 
MARCUS I'm not sure I know how to describe it. 
SERENA It's called happiness. You've been angry all your life. You don't know what it's like to feel... a part of something. 
SERENA has moved to a COMPUTER TERMINAL, one of a few here. 
SERENA (cont'd) Display recent arrivals for processing. 
IMAGES begin to appear on the screen-- small inset PHOTOS, each with a BARCODE. They quickly fill the screen. MARCUS leans forward, squinting. 
ON SCREEN - dozens of FACES, PHOTOS taken inside the TUBES, mostly looking terrified. 
MARCUS shakes his head. 
SERENA (cont'd) Next page... 
ON SCREEN - a new SET OF FACES appears one by one on the screen. This time, STAR and KYLE are among them, next to each other. 
MARCUS That's them. 
MARCUS touches the screen, two fingers, one on each of the kid's faces. THEIR IMAGES expand to fill the screen, side by side, KYLE on the left. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KYLE'S IMAGE, the date 10.16.18... the time, 22:19:23.      The word, in green: PROCESSED. 
SERENA smiles. 
SERENA Good news. He'll soon be part of the network-- you'll be able to connect with him. 
Move to STAR'S IMAGE.       10.15.18... 22:20:49... and the word, in red: TERMINATED. 
SERENA (cont'd) I'm sorry about the girl, Marcus. She didn't suffer. 
Marcus takes this in, his face shows pain. Then SERENA grasps his hand-- in moments, he's smiling. 
MARCUS Of course.     I... I understand. 
Suddenly the building SHAKES, the sound of a distant EXPLOSION. SERENA releases MARCUS, listens in her earpiece. 
MARCUS (cont'd) What is it? 
SERENA I don't know-- I have to go.    Will you be all right? (off his smile and nod) Of course you will. 
She touches him once more and moves off, leaving him alone here. We'll hear other far off EXPLOSIONS from time to time during the following. MARCUS stares at-- 
HIS FRIENDS' FACES, which slowly FADE TO BLACK, replaced by his own REFLECTION. Seeing his own face, his smile vanishes. 
MARCUS is going through a terrible internal struggle, the interface fighting his own natural emotions. He backs away from the machine, looks around at the brains, all the lives destroyed. 
Hurrying past the wall of brains, he moves a hand to the base of his skull... with an ANGRY CRY-- (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
--his FINGERS dig into the plastic skin at the back of his HEAD-- 
MARCUS grits his teeth, this is incredibly hard to do, but-- 
--he RIPS THE INTERFACE MODULE from his skull-- CONNECTIONS SPARK, we glimpse STEEL SKULL and the encased BRAIN beneath. 
MARCUS hurls the DEVICE to the floor, its elaborate CIRCUITRY SHATTERS. He reels with momentary anguish at what he's just given up-- then he moves out of there with determination. 
EXT.   OFFICE PARK FACILITY - NIGHT 
FIRE and SMOKE in the distance, VEHICLES MOVING fast amidst the destruction. It looks like the place is under attack. 
MARCUS moves purposefully across the campus-- suddenly HEADLIGHTS illuminate him. He dives out of the way as-- 
A FUTURISTIC ATV roars past at high speed.   It's followed moments later by a massive SKYNET TANK. 
MARCUS scrambles to his feet, continues on his way. 
INT.   TIME DISPLACEMENT CHAMBER - NIGHT 
THE PHYSICIST is SLAMMED against a wall. He never loses his unperturbed expression as MARCUS manhandles him. THE CLOCK reads 01:05. 
MARCUS I need to go back! 
PHYSICIST The wormholing fluctuates, right now it's oscillating between three and six hours-- 
MARCUS What do I do? 
PHYSICIST Just breach the sphere. But you could materialize anywhere in a mile radius-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THE MAN'S MOUTH twists and grimaces, making ELECTRONIC STATIC from the FRIED VOICEBOX. MARCUS is taken by surprise when-- 
--THE DECAPITATED BODY lunges at him, knocks the LASER from his grasp. After a brief STRUGGLE, MARCUS spins the engineer's HEAD to face his body. He grabs the INTERFACE at the base of his neck. 
MARCUS (cont'd) I pull this off and you'll be in a world of pain! 
THE ENGINEER'S FACE suddenly shows fear-- his body FREEZES. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MARCUS (cont'd) Last chance. Let them out. 
AT A CONTROL TERMINAL, the one-handed, headless BODY taps keys and controls. MARCUS holds the Engineer's HEAD so that he can see over his own shoulder. Moments later-- 
--the MACHINE HUM winds down. THE MONITORS flash the word "ABORT," the PANELS begin to OPEN. 
MARCUS addresses the HEAD in his hand. 
MARCUS (cont'd) I'm gonna need your clothes. 
THE HEADLESS BODY begins to unbutton its shirt. 
MOMENTS LATER - CLOSE as KYLE'S TRAY slides out of his CHAMBER. The RESTRAINTS retract automatically. He sits up, looking toward-- 
--STAR, on the next tray.   She hasn't moved, her eyes closed. 
KYLE No! 
He climbs off his tray, takes her in his arms.    She starts awake. 
STAR What? 
Around them, the dozen OTHER PRISONERS are getting to their feet, surprised at their sudden freedom. 
MARCUS approaches KYLE, buttoning his new shirt. 
KYLE Marcus! 
The two kids hurry to him, Marcus hands Star her BASEBALL CAP, rescued from the trash. As she puts it on: 
STAR I knew you'd come. 
THE PRISONERS are already on the move, frantically dashing out of the lab ahead of our heros. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
MARCUS We've gotta get out of here. 
He leads the kids out the way he came, passing... 
THE ENGINEER, in underwear, sitting in a corner, cradling his head in his lap. His remaining hand strokes his interface, his eyes closed in a blissful expression. 
INT.   UNDERGROUND GARAGE - NIGHT 
THE PRISONERS smash the GLASS DOORS off their hinges, and charge past-- 
THE CONTROL ROBOTS, which are now coming to life. ELECTRIC BURSTS drop a couple of slow-moving ESCAPEES as they dash into the garage and make for-- 
--ANY AVAILABLE VEHICLE. Former PRISONERS hijack BUSES, HYDROGEN CARS. Pure chaos, it feels like a prison riot. 
MARCUS, STAR and KYLE weave amidst the robots and humans. 
MARCUS Stay down! 
KYLE and STAR take cover behind a concrete post just as-- 
--PLASMA BURSTS explode around them. 
SKELETAL TERMINATORS armed with PLASMA RIFLES are pouring in through the OPENING GARAGE GATE. 
A STOLEN BUS heads for the exit, KNOCKING a couple of TERMINATORS aside and SMASHING through the rising GATE, clearing a path for others to follow. 
A SKELETAL TERMINATOR sets its sights on a MOVING HYDROGEN CAR, which follows the bus-- 
TERMINATOR POV - RED FILTER, HIGHLIGHTING BULL, the DRIVER. "TARGET ACQUIRED - TERMINATE." 
THE TERMINATOR SHOOTS HIS RIFLE through the car's windshield-- it EXPLODES, close to KYLE and STAR, the building SHAKES. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
--THE TANK APPEARS, moving swiftly around a corner, GUN TURRET SWIVELING at them. 
AS IT FIRES, MARCUS SWERVES onto a LAWN and-- 
--CRASHES THROUGH a PICTURE WINDOW. 
INT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT 
A handsome HYBRID COUPLE, in pajamas in front of a BIG SCREEN TV. They turn and react as the ATV skitters through the room and down a hallway. The ATV is followed a moment later by-- 
--THE TANK, which TAKES OUT THE ENTIRE WALL, BARRELLING through the living room and BURYING the HYBRIDS in RUBBLE. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS takes the ATV UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. 
THE TANK keeps SMASHING through the house, as its TURRET SWIVELS upward and BLASTS AWAY. 
UPSTAIRS - THE PLASMA BLAST COMES THROUGH the FLOOR, just missing the ATV as it rockets through a MASTER BEDROOM, toward a BALCONY. 
DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK tears through an upscale RECREATION ROOM, splintering a POOL TABLE, smashing through PINBALL MACHINES. 
UPSTAIRS - MARCUS takes the ATV straight out onto the BALCONY, THROUGH THE RAILING and INTO THE AIR. 
DOWNSTAIRS - THE TANK BLASTS THROUGH a KITCHEN and BATHROOM on its way out the other side of the house. 
EXT.   LUXURY HOME/BACK YARD - NIGHT 
THE ATV JUST CLEARS an enormous SWIMMING POOL, landing hard on the far deck and moving on, fast. 
THE TANK SMASHES THROUGH THE BACK WALL and-- 
--TAKES A NOSEDIVE into the pool, out of commission. 
INT.   LUXURY HOME - NIGHT 
THE RUBBLE in the living room shifts and the HYBRID COUPLE extract themselves, taking in their destroyed home with placid expressions. 
EXT.   RESIDENTIAL SIDESTREET - NIGHT 
A moment's breather. Marcus slows the vehicle, which WOBBLES and SMOKES from all it's been through. He looks around. 
KYLE Where are we going? 
MARCUS There. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He points toward the COAST, we see a MARINA in the distance, a BOAT moored at a DOCK. 
MARCUS steers the ATV down a slope toward the shoreline. 
EXT.   COASTLINE/DOCK - NIGHT/DAWN 
MARCUS, KYLE and STAR leap off the ATV and sprint for a MOTORBOAT. Kyle carries the rifle now. 
As they near the boat, MARCUS reacts to the sight of-- 
--RED EYES FLICKERING in the darkness at the END OF THE DOCK, the BLUE GLOW of a RIFLE CHARGING. 
MARCUS leaps in front of KYLE and STAR shielding them with his BODY. The PLASMA BLAST envelops him, MARCUS is blown-- 
--INTO THE WATER. KYLE and STAR are flattened by the force of the blast, lie motionless on the dock. Their PLASMA RIFLE lies a few feet away. 
THE SKELETAL TERMINATOR who shot Marcus moves swiftly down the dock, its PLASMA RIFLE trained on the water now. It moves past Kyle and Star, who remain motionless on the ground, and goes to the edge of the dock-- 
--BLAM! STAR snatches up their own PLASMA WEAPON, and BLASTS the thing in the back, knocking it INTO THE WATER, which is only a few feet deep here. As it rises, SHE FIRES again, taking the Terminator's head off. It goes under. 
THE SKY is beginning to LIGHTEN now as, a moment later, MARCUS EMERGES. As he climbs from the shallow water back onto the dock, Kyle and Star stare at him with astonishment. 
Seeing their expressions, he checks himself for damage-- there's METAL exposed at his shoulder, arm and hand, his FACE partially TORN AWAY, ONE EYE MISSING. He tries to speak, but can only manage an ELECTRONIC CROAK. 
Kyle and Star back away from him. 
KYLE He's not real. 
Marcus shakes his head, starts to move toward them.   STAR raises the rifle, points it at him. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
STAR Don't come any closer! 
MARCUS (cont'd) No! 
SLO-MO:   seeing Marcus, Serena reaches into her coat-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS moves at the same time, to grab his PLASMA RIFLE-- 
SERENA leaps off the ladder, aiming a small, powerful PLASMA WEAPON. 
SERENA fires first-- 
BLAM! THE PLASMA BLAST catches MARCUS in the shoulder and BLOWS his GUN ARM clean off. His PLASMA RIFLE discharges, BLOWING a HOLE in the side of the sub, near the floor-- WATER gushes in like a FIREHOSE. 
LEAVE SLO-MO. Spun around by the force of the blast, MARCUS lands on his back, SPARKS and SEVERED CABLES protruding from his damaged shoulder. An ALARM KLAXON SOUNDS. 
PRISONERS and DOCTORS SCREAM and scramble for cover-- 
CONNOR steps in front of KATE to shield her, they back away through the WATER BLAST, CONNOR FIRING at SERENA-- 
SERENA takes numerous HITS from the EXPLOSIVE BULLETS, which take off PIECES of her, but she keeps coming, FIRES again-- 
--HITTING CONNOR in the lower abdomen. He's thrown backward, KATE cries out and throws herself on top of him. His gun has gone flying. 
SERENA turns her attention to MARCUS, standing over him, plasma weapon aimed point-blank at his head. 
SERENA Why, Marcus? You were immortal... 
MARCUS manages a smile as he shakes his head. 
MARCUS No one lives forever. 
BLAM! MULTIPLE PLASMA BLASTS from behind RIDDLE SERENA'S TORSO, the BLUE PULSES burning right through her-- her HEAD takes a hit, the STEEL is RUPTURED. 
THE PLASMA WEAPON flies out of her arms, she COLLAPSES. 
TIGHT ON HER FACE, as she turns to see who got her-- 
There's no one there.    But ON THE FLOOR lies-- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
--MARCUS' SEVERED ARM, still holding his PLASMA RIFLE.     The hand RELEASES the weapon. 
SERENA'S HEAD tilts, her eyes go blank-- she's dead. 
MEDICAL PERSONNEL are doing what they can to help CONNOR, blood at his lips, KATE and KYLE at his side. 
CONNOR This... this can't happen... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
UNDERWATER - DAY 
THE SUBMARINE "LOS ANGELES" moves TOWARD CAMERA as it slowly SINKS deeper beneath the water's surface. We see a makeshift STEEL PATCH welded near the hatch. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.   SUBMARINE/CORRIDOR - DAY 
MARCUS waits outside the entrance to the SICKBAY. He's cleaned up a bit, wears fresh clothes (one sleeve pinned up). He seems weary, wrung out, his systems damaged. He'll move stiffly through the following scene, like a stroke victim. 
STAR sits beside him, a hand on his arm.   BLAIR approaches from down the corridor. 
BLAIR Marcus... I need to head back to my unit. 
MARCUS nods, keeps his head bowed. 
BLAIR (cont'd) What about you? 
His voice is still WEAK. 
MARCUS I have no idea. I should be dead... 
STAR But you're alive. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARCUS (a half-smile) So to speak. 
BLAIR We've been ordered not to talk about it-- the hybrids, everything about that place is top secret...

"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY" 
Screenplay by 
Emma Thompson 
Based on the novel by 
Jane Austen 
EXT. OPEN ROADS - NIGHT - TITLE SEQUENCE 
A series of traveling shots. A well-dressed, pompous-looking individual (JOHN DASHWOOD, 35) is making an urgent journey on horseback. He looks anxious. 
EXT. NORLAND PARK - ENGLAND - MARCH 1800 - NIGHT 
Silence. Norland Park, a large country house built in the early part of the eighteenth century, lies in the moonlit parkland. 
INT. NORLAND PARK - MR DASHWOOD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
In the dim light shed by candles we see a bed in which a MAN (MR DASHWOOD, 52) lies his skin waxy, his breathing laboured. Around him two silhouettes move and murmur, their clothing susurrating in the deathly hush. DOCTORS. A WOMAN (MRS DASHWOOD, 50) sits by his side, holding his hand, her eyes never leaving his face. 
MR DASHWOOD (urgent) Is John not yet arrived? 
MRS DASHWOOD We expect him at any moment, dearest. 
MR DASHWOOD looks anguished. 
MR DASHWOOD The girls--I have left so little. 
MRS DASHWOOD Shh, hush, Henry. 
MR DASHWOOD Elinor will try to look after you all, but make sure she finds a good husband. The men are such noodles hereabouts, little wonder none has pleased her. 
They smile at each other. MRS DASHWOOD is just managing to conceal her fear and grief 
MRS DASHWOOD But Marianne is sure to find her storybook hero. 
MR DASHWOOD A romantic poet with flashing eyes and empty pockets? 
MRS DASHWOOD As long as she loves him, whoever he is. 
MR DASHWOOD Margaret will go to sea and become a pirate so we need not concern ourselves with her. 
MRS DASHWOOD tries to laugh but it emerges as a sob. An older MANSERVANT (THOMAS) now enters, anxiety written on every feature. 
THOMAS Your son is arrived from London, sir. 
MR DASHWOOD squeezes his wife's hand. 
MR DASHWOOD Let me speak to John alone. 
She nods quickly and he smiles at her with infinite tenderness. 
MR DASHWOOD Ah, my dear. How happy you have made me. 
MRS DASHWOOD makes a superhuman effort and smiles back. She allows THOMAS to help her out. She passes JOHN DASHWOOD as he enters, presses his hand, but cannot speak. JOHN takes her place by the bed. 
JOHN Father... 
MR DASHWOOD summons his last ounces of energy and starts to whisper with desperate intensity. 
MR DASHWOOD John you will find out soon enough from my will that the estate of Norland was left to me in such a way as prevents me from dividing it between my families. 
JOHN blinks. He cannot quite take it in. 
JOHN Calm yourself, Father. This is not good for you. 
But MR DASHWOOD continues with even greater determination. 
MR DASHWOOD Norland in its entirety is therefore yours by law and I am happy for you and Fanny. 
JOHN looks torn between genuine distress and unexpected delight. 
MR DASHWOOD But your stepmother my wife and daughters are left with only five hundred pounds a year, barely enough to live on and nothing for the girls' dowries. You must help them. 
JOHN's face is a picture of conflicting emotions. Behind them is the ominous rustling of parchments. 
JOHN Of course 
MR DASHWOOD You must promise to do this. 
A brief moment of sincerity overcomes JOHN's natural hypocrisy. 
JOHN I promise, Father, I promise. 
MR DASHWOOD seems relieved. Suddenly his breathing changes. JOHN looks alarmed. He rises and we hear him going to find the DOCTOR. 
JOHN Come! Come quickly! 
But it is we who share the dying man's last words. 
MR DASHWOOD Help them. 
EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - LONDON - DAY 
ELINOR (V.O.) Won't you come out, dearest? We haven't seen you all day. Mamma is very concerned. 
More silence. EDWARD thinks hard. He makes a decision. 
INT. NORLAND PARK - LIBRARY - DAY 
EDWARD walks in loudly. 
EDWARD Oh, Miss Dashwood! Excuse me I was wondering do you by any chance have such a thing as a reliable atlas? 
ELINOR looks up at him in astonishment. 
ELINOR I believe so. 
EDWARD Excellent. I wish to check the position of the Nile. 
EDWARD appears to be utterly sincere. 
EDWARD My sister says it is in South America. 
From under the table we hear a snort. ELINOR looks at him in realisation. 
ELINOR Oh! No, no indeed. She is quite wrong. For I believe it is in--in Belgium. 
EDWARD Belgium? Surely not. You must be thinking of the Volga. 
MARGARET (from under the table) The Volga? 
ELINOR Of course. The Volga, which, as you know, starts in... 
EDWARD Vladivostok, and ends in... 
ELINOR St Albans. 
EDWARD Indeed. Where the coffee beans come from. 
They are having such a good time that it is rather a pity the game is stopped by the appearance from under the table of MARGARET who reveals herself to be a disheveled girl of eleven. She hauls the atlas up and plonks it in front of EDWARD. 
MARGARET The source of the Nile is in Abyssinia. 
EDWARD Is it? Good heavens. How do you do. Edward Ferrars. 
MARGARET Margaret Dashwood. 
EDWARD shakes MARGARET's hand solemnly and looks over her head at ELINOR. They smile at each other, a connection made. 
INT. NORLAND PARK - DRAWING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY 
JOHN is reading a newspaper. MRS DASHWOOD sits across from FANNY, who thumbs through a fashion-plate magazine. ELINOR is at a desk by the window writing a letter we see the words 'of course we should like to leave as soon as possible'. Suddenly she hears a commotion outside. MARGARET runs past the window brandishing a stick. EDWARD follows, and proceeds to teach her the first principles of sword-fighting. They feint and parry, EDWARD serious and without a hint of condescension, MARGARET concentrating furiously. EDWARD suddenly turns, as though feeling ELINOR's gaze. She smiles but looks away quickly. 
INT. NORLAND PARK - VELVET ROOM - ANOTHER DAY 
EDWARD comes into the doorway and sees ELINOR who is listening to MARIANNE playing a concerto. ELINOR stands in a graceful, rather sad attitude, her back to us. Suddenly she senses EDWARD behind her and turns. He is about to turn away, embarrassed to have been caught admiring her, when he sees she has been weeping. Hastily she tries to dry her eyes. He comes forward and offers her a handkerchief, which she takes with a grateful smile. We notice his monogram in the corner: ECF. 
ELINOR (apologetic) That was my father's favourite. 
EDWARD nods kindly. 
ELINOR Thank you so much for your help with Margaret, Mr Ferrars. She is a changed girl since your arrival. 
EDWARD Not at all. I enjoy her company. 
ELINOR Has she shown you her tree-house? 
EDWARD Not yet. Would you do me the honour, Miss Dashwood? It is very fine out. 
ELINOR With pleasure. 
They start to walk out of shot, still talking. 
ELINOR Margaret has always wanted to travel. 
EDWARD I know. She is heading an expedition to China shortly. I am to go as her servant but only on the understanding that I will be very badly treated. 
ELINOR What will your duties be? 
EDWARD Sword-fighting, administering rum and swabbing. 
ELINOR Ah. 
CAM tilts up to find MRS DASHWOOD on the middle landing of the staircase, smiling down at them. CAM tilts up yet further to find FANNY on the landing above, watching EDWARD and ELINOR with a face like a prune. 
EXT. NORLAND PARK - GARDENS - DAY 
EDWARD and ELINOR are still talking as they walk arm in arm in the late afternoon sun. 
EDWARD All I want--all I have ever wanted is the quiet of a private life but my mother is determined to see me distinguished. 
ELINOR As? 
EDWARD She hardly knows. Any fine figure will suit a great orator, a leading politician, even a barrister would serve, but only on the condition that I drive my own barouche and dine in the first circles. 
His tone is light but there is an underlying bitterness to it. 
ELINOR And what do you wish for? 
MARIANNE The more I know of the world, the more I am convinced that I shall never see a man whom I can truly love. 
MRS DASHWOOD You require so much! 
MARIANNE I do not! I require only what any young woman of taste should a man who sings well, dances admirably, rides bravely, reads with passion and whose tastes agree in every point with my own. 
INT. NORLAND PARK - ELINOR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ELINOR is in bed, deep in thought. MARIANNE enters in her nightclothes, carrying a book of poetry. She reads, teasingly. 
MARIANNE Is love a fancy, or a feeling? No It is immortal as immaculate truth 'Tis not a blossom shed as soon as Youth Drops from the stem of life for it will grow In barren regions, where no waters flow Nor ray of promise cheats the pensive gloom-- 
She jumps onto the bed. ELINOR smiles somewhat suspiciously. 
MARIANNE What a pity it is that Edward has no passion for reading. 
ELINOR It was you who asked him to read and then you made him nervous. 
MARIANNE Me? 
ELINOR But your behaviour to him in all other respects is perfectly cordial so I must assume that you like him in spite of his deficiencies. 
MARIANNE (trying hard) I think him everything that is amiable and worthy. 
ELINOR Praise indeed! 
MARIANNE But he shall have my unanswering devotion when you tell me he is to be my brother. 
ELINOR is greatly taken aback and does not know how to reply. Suddenly MARIANNE hugs her passionately. 
MARIANNE How shall I do without you? 
ELINOR Do without me? 
MARIANNE pulls away, her eyes full of tears. 
MARIANNE I am sure you will be very happy. But you must promise not to live too far away. 
ELINOR Marianne, there is no question of that is, there is no under standing between... 
ELINOR trails off. MARIANNE looks at her keenly. 
MARIANNE Do you love him? 
The bold clarity of this question discomforts ELINOR. 
ELINOR I do not attempt to deny that I think very highly of him that I greatly esteem that I like him. 
MARIANNE Esteem him! Like him! Use those insipid words again and I shall leave the room this instant! 
This makes ELINOR laugh in spite of her discomfort. 
ELINOR Very well. Forgive me. Believe my feelings to be stronger than I have declared but further than that you must not believe. 
MARIANNE is flummoxed but she rallies swiftly and picks up her book again. 
MARIANNE 'Is love a fancy or a feeling?' Or a Ferrars? 
ELINOR Go to bed! 
ELINOR blushes in good earnest. MARIANNE goes to the door. 
MARIANNE (imitating Elinor) 'I do not attempt to deny that I think highly of him greatly esteem him! Like him!' 
And she is gone, leaving ELINOR both agitated and amused. 
INT. NORLAND PARK - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY 
FANNY is standing by the window looking out. We see her POV of ELINOR and EDWARD walking in the garden. 
MRS DASHWOOD enters, pauses for a moment and then joins FANNY at the window. FANNY pretends not to have been watching but MRS DASHWOOD looks down at the lovers and then smiles sweetly at her. 
MRS DASHWOOD We are all so happy that you chose to invite Edward to Norland. He is a dear boy and we are all very fond of him. 
FANNY does a bit of quick thinking. 
FANNY We have great hopes for him. Much is expected of him by our mother with regard to his profession 
MRS DASHWOOD Naturally. 
FANNY And in marriage. She is determined that both he and Robert will marry well. 
MRS DASHWOOD Of course. But I hope she desires them to marry for love, first and foremost? I have always felt that, contrary to common wisdom, true affection is by far the most valuable dowry. 
FANNY Love is all very well, but unfortunately we cannot always rely on the heart to lead us in the most suitable directions. 
FANNY lowers her voice confidingly. 
FANNY You see, my dear Mrs Dashwood, Edward is entirely the kind of compassionate person upon whom penniless women can prey--and having entered into any kind of understanding, he would never go back on his word. He is quite simply incapable of doing so. But it would lead to his ruin. I worry for him so, Mrs Dashwood. My mother has always made it perfectly plain that she will withdraw all financial support from Edward, should he choose to plant his affections in less... exalted ground than he deserves. 
It is impossible for MRS DASHWOOD not to get the point. She is appalled and furious. 
MRS DASHWOOD I understand you perfectly. 
She sweeps off. 
EDWARD Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. 
FANNY drags EDWARD off, leaving ELINOR to gaze sadly after them. 
INT. THE LADIES' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - RAIN - EVE 
The DASHWOODS are on their way. The mood is very sombre. 
MARGARET Edward promised he would bring the atlas to Barton for me. 
MARIANNE looks at ELINOR, pleased. 
MARIANNE Did he? Well, I will wager he will do so in less than a fortnight! 
MRS DASHWOOD looks at ELINOR with satisfaction. 
EXT. THE LADIES' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - EVE 
The carriage rolls on. 
MARGARET (V.O.) Are we there yet? 
EXT. ROAD TO AND FROM BARTON COTTAGE - DAY 
In comparison to Norland, Barton Cottage has the air of a damp shoebox. it sits low and bleak in the grey lonely countryside. 
From one side we can see the DASHWOODS' carriage drawing up at the gate. From the other, a much grander vehicle, from which loud whooping can be heard, is approaching. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN PATH - DAY 
As the exhausted DASHWOODS alight, they converge with a ruddy- complexioned MAN in a redingote (SIR JOHN MIDDLETON) and a rotund, equally roseate LADY (MRS JENNINGS) who have fallen over each other in their haste to get out of their carriage. 
MRS DASHWOOD Sir John! 
SIR JOHN clasps her hands and starts to help her up the path, followed by ELINOR, MARIANNE and MARGARET, who is clearly fascinated by his bouncy companion. 
SIR JOHN Dear ladies, dear ladies, upon my word, here you are, here you are, here you are! 
MRS DASHWOOD Sir John, your extraordinary kindness-- 
SIR JOHN Oh, none of that, hush, please, none of that, but here is my dear mamma- in-law Mrs Jennings. 
MRS JENNINGS Was the journey tolerable, you poor souls? 
SIR JOHN Why did you not come up to the Park first and take your ease? We saw you pass--Like many people who live rather lonely lives together. 
SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS talk incessantly, interrupt each other all the time and never listen. 
MRS JENNINGS --but I would not wait for you to come to us, I made John call for the carriage-- 
SIR JOHN She would not wait, you know. 
MRS JENNINGS --as we get so little company. 
They reach the front door and BETSY's smiling welcome. In the confusion of milling people and THOMAS carrying the lighter luggage, MARIANNE contrives to slip into the house alone. We follow her but hear the conversation continuing in V.O. MARIANNE looks about the parlour, where a dismal fire is smoking. She starts up the stairs, expressionless. 
MRS JENNINGS (V.O.) But I feel as if I know you already-- delightful creatures! 
SIR JOHN (V.O.) Delightful! And you know you are to dine at Barton Park every day. 
MRS DASHWOOD (V.O.) Oh, but dear Sir John, we cannot-- 
SIR JOHN (V.O.) Oh, no no no no no no no, I shall not brook refusals. I am quite deaf to 'em, you know-- 
MRS JENNINGS (V.O.) --deaf-- 
MARIANNE enters a small bedroom. She sits on the bed. Then she goes to the window and opens it. Voices float up. 
SIR JOHN (V.O.) But I insist! 
ELINOR (V.O.) Let us only settle in for a few days, Sir John, and thank you-- 
SIR JOHN (V.O.) Oh, no thankings, no, please, can't bear 'em, embarrassing, you know-- 
MARIANNE closes the window and crosses the corridor to another bed room--similarly stark. She sighs and turns back down the stairs. 
SIR JOHN (V.O.) We will send game and fruit as a matter of course-- 
MRS JENNINGS (V.O.) --fruit and game-- 
SIR JOHN (V.O.) --and the carriage is at your beck and call-- 
MARIANNE joins the group, who are now in the parlour. 
MRS JENNINGS --call--and here is Miss Marianne! 
SIR JOHN Where did you disappear to? 
MRS JENNINGS I declare you are the loveliest girl I ever set eyes on! Cannot you get them married, Mrs Dashwood? You must not leave it too long! 
SIR JOHN But, alas, there are no smart young men hereabouts to woo them-- 
MRS JENNINGS --not a beau for miles! 
The strain of exhibiting joy and gratitude is beginning to tell on MRS DASHWOOD who is sagging visibly. 
MRS JENNINGS Give us a clue, Miss Dashwood--is he in uniform? 
ELINOR starts to change the subject, but MARGARET interrupts her. 
MARGARET He has no profession! 
SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS turn on her with screams of delight. ELINOR, MARIANNE and MRS DASHWOOD look at each other helplessly. 
SIR JOHN No profession! A gentleman, then! 
MARIANNE (with daggers) Margaret, you know perfectly well there is no such person. 
MARGARET There is! There is! And his name begins with an F! 
ELINOR looks hard at her plate. 
MRS DASHWOOD Margaret! 
MRS DASHWOOD is appalled at her youngest's relish for such a vulgar game. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are cock-a-hoop. 
SIR JOHN F indeed! A very promising letter. Let me--F, F, Fo, Fa... Upon my word, but I cannot think of a single name beginning with F-- 
MRS JENNINGS Forrest? Foster? Frost? Foggarty? 
MARIANNE suddenly stands up. SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are so surprised they stop talking. Everyone stares at MARIANNE. 
MARIANNE (controlled fury) Sir John, might I play your pianoforte? 
SIR JOHN Of course, yes--my goodness. We do not stand on ceremony here, my dear. 
For once, ELINOR is grateful for her sister's rudeness as everyone rises and follows MARIANNE out. 
EXT. BARTON PARK - FRONT STEPS - EVE 
A soldierly MAN of about forty (COLONEL BRANDON) is dismounting from his horse. From within we hear MARIANNE's song begin. His head snaps up to the windows. An expression of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes. 
INT. BARTON PARK - MUSIC ROOM - EVE 
Everyone watches MARIANNE as she plays and sings. Behind them we see BRANDON entering. But he stays in the shadow of the door and no one notices him. CLOSE on his face. He gazes at MARIANNE with an unfathomable look of grief and longing. He breathes in deeply. Suddenly, ELINOR feels his presence and looks around at him. After a few moments, she turns back, slightly puzzled. The song finishes. Everyone claps. The MAN ventures out into the light and SIR JOHN springs from his seat. 
SIR JOHN Brandon! Where have you been? Come, come and meet our beautiful new neighbours! 
MRS JENNINGS What a pity you are late, Colonel! You have missed the most delightful singing! 
BRANDON bows to the company and smiles slightly. 
COLONEL BRANDON A great pity, indeed. 
ELINOR looks at him, even more puzzled. 
SIR JOHN Mrs Dashwood, may I present my dear friend Colonel Brandon? We served together in the East Indies and I assure you there is no better fellow on earth-- 
MARGARET Have you really been to the East Indies, Colonel? 
COLONEL BRANDON I have. 
MARGARET What is it like? 
MARGARET is quivering with fascination. 
SIR JOHN Like? Hot. 
But COLONEL BRANDON knows what MARGARET wants to hear. 
COLONEL BRANDON (mysteriously) The air is full of spices. 
MARGARET smiles with satisfaction. 
SIR JOHN Come, Miss Dashwood--it is your turn to entertain us! 
ELINOR Oh no, Sir John, I do not-- 
SIR JOHN --and I think we can all guess what key you will sing in! 
SIR JOHN and MRS JENNINGS are bursting with their new joke. 
SIR JOHN/MRS JENNINGS F major! 
They fall about. 
INT. SIR JOHN'S CARRIAGE - NIGHT 
The DASHWOODS are returning home. A row is in progress. 
MARIANNE (to Margaret) As for you, you have no right, no right at all, to parade your ignorant assumptions-- 
MARGARET They are not assumptions. You told me. 
ELINOR stares at MARIANNE. MARIANNE colours and attacks MARGARET again. 
MARIANNE I told you nothing-- 
MARGARET They'll meet him when he comes, anyway. 
MARIANNE That is not the point. You do not speak of such things before strangers-- 
BRANDON looks at MRS JENNINGS warningly but she ignores him. 
MRS JENNINGS I'll trow you know quite as many melancholy tunes as Miss Marianne! 
Her tone is so knowing that MARIANNE frowns uncomfortably. 
MRS JENNINGS Come! Let us see you both side by side! 
MARIANNE rises impatiently. 
MARIANNE I do not know any duets. Forgive me, Colonel. 
She moves away. MRS JENNINGS chuckles. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - LATE AFTERNOON 
The DASHWOODS returning. MARIANNE is taking her bonnet off so furiously that she simply gets the knot tighter and tighter. Despite them selves, ELINOR and MRS DASHWOOD are amused. 
MARIANNE Oh! Are we never to have a moment's peace? The rent here may be low but I think we have it on very hard terms. 
ELINOR Mrs Jennings is a wealthy woman with a married daughter--she has nothing to do but marry off everyone else's. 
BETSY pokes her head out from the dining room. 
BETSY There's a parcel arrived for you, Miss Dashwood! 
MARGARET A parcel! 
They all crowd into the dining room to find a large package on the table, which MARGARET is permitted to open. In the meantime ELINOR comes to the rescue with the bonnet and MARIANNE stands shifting like a spirited mare as ELINOR patiently unravels the knot. 
MARIANNE It is too ridiculous! When is a man to be safe from such wit if age and infirmity do not protect him? 
ELINOR Infirmity! 
MRS DASHWOOD If Colonel Brandon is infirm, then I am at death's door. 
ELINOR It is a miracle your life has extended this far... 
MARIANNE Did you not hear him complain of a rheumatism in his shoulder? 
ELINOR A slight ache' I believe was his phrase... 
MARIANNE smiles and ELINOR laughs at her. Then MARGARET opens the parcel to reveal--her atlas. The atmosphere alters immediately as MRS DASHWOOD and MARIANNE look at ELINOR in consternation. 
MARGARET But Edward said he would bring it himself. 
There is a letter on top of the atlas. CLOSE on the address 'To the Dashwoods'. MRS DASHWOOD picks it up, looks at ELINOR, and opens 
MRS DASHWOOD 'Dear Mrs Dashwood, Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne and Captain Margaret-- it gives me great pleasure to restore this atlas to its rightful owner. Alas, business in London does not permit me to accompany it, although this is likely to hurt me far more than it hurts you. For the present my memories of your kindness must be enough to sustain me, and I remain your devoted servant always. E. C. Ferrars.' 
A silence greets this brief epistle. ELINOR struggles to contain her bitter disappointment. 
MARGARET But why hasn't he come? 
MRS DASHWOOD He says he is busy, dear. 
MARGARET He said he'd come. 
MARGARET is genuinely upset. ELINOR quietly hangs up MARIANNE's bonnet. 
MARGARET Why hasn't he come? 
MRS DASHWOOD looks beseechingly at MARIANNE, who nods and grasps MARGARET's hand. 
MARIANNE I am taking you for a walk. 
MARGARET No! I've been a walk. 
MARIANNE You need another. 
MARGARET It is going to rain. 
MARIANNE shoves her bonnet back on and drags MARGARET out. 
MARIANNE It is not going to rain. 
MARGARET You always say that and then it always does. 
We hear the front door slam behind them. There is a short silence. 
MRS DASHWOOD I fear Mrs Jennings is a bad influence. 
She approaches ELINOR. 
MRS DASHWOOD You must miss him, Elinor. 
ELINOR looks very directly at her mother. 
ELINOR We are not engaged, Mamma. 
MRS DASHWOOD But he loves you, dearest, of that I am certain. 
ELINOR looks down. She speaks slowly, choosing her words with care. 
ELINOR I am by no means assured of his regard for me. 
MARIANNE Do not be alarmed, Mamma. 
The STRANGER deposits MARIANNE on the sofa. They look straight into each other's eyes. Electric. 
THE STRANGER I can assure you it is not serious. I took the liberty of feeling the bone and it is perfectly sound. 
ELINOR raises her eyebrows at MARIANNE, who blushes to her roots. 
MRS DASHWOOD Sir, I cannot even begin to thank you. 
THE STRANGER Please do not think of it. I'm honoured of be of service. 
MRS DASHWOOD Will you not be seated? 
THE STRANGER Pray excuse me--I have no desire to leave a water mark! But permit me to call tomorrow afternoon and inquire after the patient? 
MRS DASHWOOD We shall look forward to it! 
He turns to MARIANNE and smiles. She smiles back gloriously. He bows, and sweeps out of the room. 
MARIANNE (hissing) His name! His name! 
MRS DASHWOOD silences her with a gesture and follows him out with all the solicitous charm she can command while MARGARET pokes her head around the door to watch. ELINOR is removing MARIANNE's boot and trying not to laugh at her. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY 
MRS DASHWOOD calls out after him. 
MRS DASHWOOD Please tell us to whom we are so much obliged? 
The STRANGER mounts Bedivere and turns to her. 
THE STRANGER John Willoughby of Allenham--your servant, ma'am! 
And he gallops off into the mist--we almost expect Bedivere to sprout wings. CLOSE on MRS DASHWOOD's excited expression. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
MRS DASHWOOD runs back into the parlour, jittering with excitement and anxiety. 
MARIANNE Mr John Willoughby of Allenham! 
MRS DASHWOOD What an impressive gentleman! 
MARIANNE He lifted me as if I weighed no more than a dried leaf! 
ELINOR Is he human? 
MARIANNE hits ELINOR. MRS DASHWOOD tends to her ankle. 
MRS DASHWOOD Tell me if I hurt you. 
ELINOR (regarding Marianne's ecstatic expression) She feels no pain, Mamma. Margaret, ask Betsy to make up a cold compress, please. 
MARGARET (leaving reluctantly) Did you see him? He expressed himself well, did he not? 
MRS DASHWOOD With great decorum and honour. 
MARIANNE And spirit and wit and feeling. 
ELINOR And economy--ten words at most. 
From below stairs we can hear MARGARET wailing Wait for me! 
MARIANNE And he is to come tomorrow! 
ELINOR You must change, Marianne--you will catch a cold. 
MARIANNE What care I for colds when there is such a man? 
ELINOR You will care very much when your nose swells up. 
MARIANNE You are right. Help me, Elinor. 
MARGARET comes back with the bandages. 
MARGARET What has happened? 
ELINOR We have decided to give you to the Gypsies. 
ELINOR and MARIANNE go upstairs. MARGARET whispers to MRS DASHWOOD. 
MARGARET Will they be married before Edward and Elinor, do you think, Mamma? 
MRS DASHWOOD Margaret, you are worse than Mrs Jennings. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - MORNING 
The rain has cleared. SIR JOHN's horse munches grass contentedly by the side of the road. 
SIR JOHN (V.O.) Mr Willoughby is well worth catching, Miss Dashwood--Miss Marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself! 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - MORNING 
The DASHWOODS are having a frustrating time winkling information about WILLOUGHBY out of SIR JOHN, who is in turn only anxious to protect BRANDON's interest. MARIANNE has her bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience. 
MR PALMER regards his wife with a less than enchanted expression. 
MR PALMER Nothing like. 
CHARLOTTE (laughing gaily) Why, Mr Palmer! Do you know you are quite rude today? He is to be an MP, you know, Mrs Dashwood, and it is very fatiguing for him for he is forced to make everybody like him-- he says it is quite shocking-- 
MRS PALMER I never said anything so irrational. Don't palm all your abuses of the language upon me. 
MRS JENNINGS (to Mrs Dashwood) Mr Palmer is so droll--he is always out of humour. 
MR PALMER does indeed have the air of a man under siege. WILLOUGH BY suddenly appears in his curricle. MARIANNE waves to him with a radiant smile. MRS JENNINGS nudges CHARLOTTE and points to MARIANNE. 
MRS JENNINGS Here he is! Now you shall see, Charlotte. 
WILLOUGHBY drives up as close to MARIANNE as possible, making her laugh. 
MRS JENNINGS How now, Mr Willoughby! You must greet my daughter Charlotte, and Mr Palmer-- 
WILLOUGHBY How do you do? 
MRS JENNINGS And my little cousin, Miss Lucy Steele. 
WILLOUGHBY Welcome to our party, Miss Steele! 
LUCY bobs demurely. WILLOUGHBY inclines his head politely, leaps from the curricle and hands MARIANNE in. MRS JENNINGS coos and chuckles at them. CHARLOTTE nudges ELINOR. 
CHARLOTTE I know Mr Willoughby extremely well-- not that I ever spoke to him but I have seen him forever in town. Your sister is monstrous lucky to get him. Mamma says Colonel Brandon is in love with her as well, which is a very great compliment for he hardly ever falls in love with anyone. 
ELINOR smiles politely. WILLOUGHBY moves the curricle out to the front of the drive. CHARLOTTE points after them and laughs with MRS JENNINGS. LUCY edges up beside ELINOR. 
LUCY May I beg a seat beside you, Miss Dashwood? I have so longed to make your better acquaintance! I have heard nothing but the highest praise for you. 
ELINOR is relieved to change the subject. 
ELINOR I would be delighted. But Sir John and Mrs Jennings are too excessive in their compliments. I am sure to disappoint. 
LUCY No, for it was from quite another source that I heard you praised and one not at all inclined to exaggeration. 
LUCY speaks in a knowing, confidential undertone, as though not wanting anyone else to hear. At that moment a HORSEMAN thunders up the drive towards them. Everyone turns to face the new arrival. 
SIR JOHN What can this be? 
It is a MESSENGER who has obviously had a long, hard ride. He asks for COLONEL BRANDON and hands him a letter, which BRANDON tears open. MRS JENNINGS is puce with suppressed curiosity. 
COLONEL BRANDON My horse! Quickly! 
SIR JOHN What is the matter, Brandon? 
COLONEL BRANDON I must away to London. 
SIR JOHN No! Impossible! 
Everyone gathers round BRANDON, who is, naturally, mortified. A SERVANT brings up the COLONEL's horse. 
COLONEL BRANDON Imperative. 
There is a murmur of disappointment from the party. SIR JOHN is embarrassed and protests again. 
SIR JOHN But Brandon, we are all assembled. We cannot picnic at Delaford without our host! Go up to town tomorrow. 
WILLOUGHBY Or wait till we return and start then--you would not be six hours later. 
COLONEL BRANDON I cannot afford to lose one minute. 
As he speaks, he is mounting his horse. His grave urgency silences all protest and he gallops off, leaving everyone stunned and, of course, deeply curious. Then they all start to talk at once. LUCY is still next to ELINOR. 
LUCY Oh, Miss Dashwood, I cannot bear it! Just when I was to have the opportunity of speaking with you. 
EXT. MEADOW NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY 
Having been denied their trip, the DASHWOODS and WILLOUGHBY have set out an impromptu picnic. WILLOUGHBY is wandering restlessly about. 
The weather is sublime. 
WILLOUGHBY Frailty, thy name is Brandon! 
MARIANNE There are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. I think he wrote the letter himself as a trick for getting out of it. 
MRS DASHWOOD (indulgently) You are a very wicked pair, Colonel Brandon will be sadly missed. 
WILLOUGHBY Why? When he is the kind of man that everyone speaks well of and no one wants to talk to. 
MARIANNE Exactly! 
ELINOR Nonsense. 
MRS DASHWOOD Colonel Brandon is very highly esteemed at the Park. 
WILLOUGHBY Which is enough censure in itself. 
ELINOR (half laughing) Really, Willoughby! 
WILLOUGHBY (imitating Mrs Jennings perfectly) Come, come, Mr Impudence--I know you and your wicked ways--oh! 
He gives a little shriek and waddles about the garden doing her walk. He comes up to ELINOR and puts his head on her shoulder. 
MRS DASHWOOD What is wrong, my dearest? 
MARIANNE shakes her head and waves them away. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
ELINOR, MARGARET and MRS DASHWOOD enter to find WILLOUGHBY standing in a frozen attitude by the fireplace. 
MRS DASHWOOD Willoughby! What is the matter? 
WILLOUGHBY I--forgive me, Mrs Dashwood. I am sent--that is to say, Lady Allen has exercised the privilege of riches upon a dependent cousin and is sending me to London. 
He cannot look any of them in the eye. 
MRS DASHWOOD When--this morning? 
WILLOUGHBY Almost this moment. 
MRS DASHWOOD How very disappointing! But your business will not detain you from us for long, I hope? 
WILLOUGHBY You are very kind--but I have no idea of returning immediately to Devonshire. I am seldom invited to Allenham more than once a year. 
MRS DASHWOOD For shame, Willoughby! Can you wait for an invitation from Barton Cottage? 
WILLOUGHBY My engagements at present are of such a nature--that is--I dare not flatter myself-- 
The atmosphere is thick with tension. WILLOUGHBY flicks a glance at the three WOMEN staring at him in mute astonishment. 
WILLOUGHBY It is folly to linger in this manner. I will not torment myself further. 
He rushes past them and out of the cottage. They follow him to the door. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - FRONT DOOR - DAY 
The DASHWOODS cluster round the door. 
MARGARET Willoughby, come back! 
She is silenced by ELINOR as WILLOUGHBY seizes Bedivere's reins from THOMAS, mounts up and rides off at a furious pace. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
They all rush back into the parlour. 
ELINOR Meg, dearest, please ask Betsy to make a cup of hot tea for Marianne. 
MARGARET nods dumbly and goes. MRS DASHWOOD has her arms around MARIANNE. 
MRS DASHWOOD What is wrong, my love? 
MARIANNE Nothing! Please do not ask me questions! 
MARIANNE struggles free. 
MARIANNE Please let me be! 
She runs off upstairs and we hear her bedroom door slamming. There is a moment of stunned silence. 
ELINOR They must have quarreled. 
MRS DASHWOOD That is unlikely. Perhaps this--Lady Allen--disapproves of his regard for Marianne and has invented an excuse to send him away? 
ELINOR Then why did he not say as much? It is not like Willoughby to be secretive. Did he think Marianne was richer than she is? 
MRS DASHWOOD How could he? 
She gestures to the room and then looks at ELINOR with a frown. 
MRS DASHWOOD What is it you suspect him of? 
ELINOR I can hardly tell you. But why was his manner so guilty? 
MRS DASHWOOD What are you saying, Elinor? That he has been acting a part to your sister for all this time? 
MRS DASHWOOD is getting defensive. ELINOR pauses to think. 
ELINOR No, he loves her, I am sure. 
MRS DASHWOOD Of course he loves her! 
ELINOR But has he left her with any assurance of his return? Cannot you ask her if he has proposed? 
MRS DASHWOOD Certainly not. I cannot force a confidence from Marianne and nor must you. We must trust her to confide in us in her own time. 
ELINOR (shaking her head) There was something so underhand in the manner of his leaving. 
MRS DASHWOOD You are resolved, then, to think the worst of him. 
ELINOR Not resolved-- 
MRS DASHWOOD (cold) I prefer to give him the benefit of my good opinion. He deserves no less. From all of us. 
She stalks out of the room and starts up the stairs. ELINOR follows her. 
ELINOR Mamma, I am very fond of Willoughby-- 
MARIANNE looks out of the window. 
MARIANNE Yes, you are right. 
She sits down with a rueful smile. Suddenly a much louder rap is heard and they both jump. We hear a bustling downstairs. MARIANNE can hardly breathe. She goes to the drawing-room door, opens it, goes out, comes back in. We hear a MAN's voice. 
MARIANNE Oh, Elinor! It is Willoughby, indeed it is! 
She turns and almost throws herself into the arms of COLONEL BRANDON. 
MARIANNE Oh! Excuse me, Colonel-- 
She leaves the room hastily. ELINOR is so ashamed of MARIANNE's rudeness that she does not at first notice BRANDON's mood of tense distress. 
ELINOR Colonel Brandon, what a pleasure to see you! Have you been in London all this while? 
COLONEL BRANDON I have. How is your dear mother? 
ELINOR Very well, thank you. 
Silence. 
ELINOR Colonel, is there anything-- 
But BRANDON interrupts her. 
COLONEL BRANDON Forgive me, Miss Dashwood, but I have heard reports through town... is it impossible to--but I could have no chance of succeeding--indeed I hardly know what to do. Tell me once and for all, is everything finally resolved between your sister and Mr Willoughby? 
ELINOR is torn between discomfiture and compassion. 
ELINOR Colonel, though neither one has informed me of their under standing, I have no doubt of their mutual affection. 
BRANDON stands very still. 
COLONEL BRANDON Thank you, Miss Dashwood. To your sister I wish all imaginable happiness. To Mr Willoughby, that he... may endeavour to deserve her. 
His tone is heavy with some bitter meaning. 
ELINOR What do you mean? 
But he recollects himself. 
COLONEL BRANDON Forgive me, I--forgive me. 
He bows and leaves abruptly. ELINOR is deeply troubled. 
EXT. GREENWICH ARCADE - LONDON - DAY 
The PALMERS, MRS JENNINGS, JOHN, FANNY, LUCY, ELINOR and MARIANNE are walking through the arcade. Additional wealth has evidently encouraged FANNY sartorially and she sprouts as much fruit and feathers as a market stall. LUCY is holding ELINOR's arm in a pinionlike grip. MRS JENNINGS is gossiping with CHARLOTTE. 
MARIANNE's good looks are heightened by her feverish expectation of seeing WILLOUGHBY at every step, and many young men raise their hats to her and turn as she passes. 
MARIANNE Where is dear Edward, John? We expect to see him daily. 
FANNY stiffens. LUCY's sharp eyes dart hither and thither. MRS JENNINGS senses gossip. ELINOR steels herself. 
MRS JENNINGS And who is 'dear Edward'? 
CHARLOTTE Who indeed? 
FANNY smiles glacially. 
FANNY My brother, Mrs Jennings--Edward Ferrars. 
MRS JENNINGS looks at ELINOR in sly triumph. 
MRS JENNINGS Indeed! Is that Ferrars with an F? 
She and CHARLOTTE chuckle to each other. LUCY looks at ELINOR. 
INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - HALL - EVE 
MRS JENNINGS, LUCY, ELINOR and MARIANNE return from their outing. MARIANNE immediately assails PIGEON. 
MARIANNE Are there any messages, Pigeon? 
PIGEON No, ma'am. 
MARIANNE No message at all? No cards? 
PIGEON (affronted) None, ma am. 
MARIANNE sighs with disappointment and starts up the stairs. MRS JENNINGS looks archly at ELINOR. 
MRS JENNINGS I note you do not inquire for your messages, Miss Dashwood! 
ELINOR No, for I do not expect any, Mrs Jennings. I have very little acquaintance in town. 
And she follows MARIANNE firmly upstairs. LUCY watches her go, and MRS JENNINGS chuckles and turns to her. 
MRS JENNINGS She is as sly as you, Lucy! 
INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ELINOR wakes up. The flickering of a candle has disturbed her. She sits up in bed and sees MARIANNE sitting at the desk in her nightgown, writing another letter. 
WILLOUGHBY (stiff) How do you do, Miss Dashwood? 
ELINOR does not know quite how to respond. 
ELINOR I am well, thank you, Mr Willoughby. 
She looks about for MARIANNE, instinctively wanting to keep her away from WILLOUGHBY. 
WILLOUGHBY How is your--family? 
ELINOR (cold) We are all extremely well, Mr Willoughby--thank you for your kind inquiry. 
WILLOUGHBY is shamed into silence. Then he sees MARIANNE. At the same moment the music pauses. MARIANNE looks up. In the brief moment of relative quiet, her great cry rings across the room. 
MARIANNE Willoughby! 
Everyone turns to look as MARIANNE rushes towards him with both arms outstretched, her face luminous with joy. As the noise of the room builds again and PEOPLE change their partners, we are aware that many are surreptitiously watching. MARIANNE reaches him but WILLOUGHBY stands with his arms frozen at his side. MARIANNE gives a little confused laugh. 
MARIANNE Good God, Willoughby! Will you nor shake hands with me? 
WILLOUGHBY looks extremely uncomfortable and glances towards a group of very smart PEOPLE who are watching him closely. Central to this group is a SOPHISTICATED WOMAN who frowns at him proprietorially. 
WILLOUGHBY shakes MARIANNE's hand briefly. Behind her, MRS JENNINGS is giving an animated commentary to FANNY and JOHN, while LUCY whispers in ROBERT's ear as they go past to join the set. 
WILLOUGHBY (strangled) How do you do, Miss Marianne? 
MARIANNE Willoughby, what is the matter? Why have you not come to see me? Were you not in London? Have you nor received my letters? 
WILLOUGHBY is sweating with tension. 
WILLOUGHBY Yes, I had the pleasure of receiving the information which you were so good as to send me. 
MARIANNE (piteously) For heaven's sake, Willoughby, tell me what is wrong! 
WILLOUGHBY Thank you--I am most obliged. If you will excuse me, I must return to my party. 
He bows, white to the teeth, and walks away to join the SOPHISTICATED WOMAN. 
MARIANNE Willoughby! 
He is drawn away by his PARTY, some of whom look back at MARIANNE with a mixture of curiosity and condescension. MARIANNE almost sinks to her knees. ELINOR supports her. 
ELINOR Marianne! Come away! 
MARIANNE Go to him, Elinor--force him to come to me. 
MRS JENNINGS has come up, full of concern. 
ELINOR Dearest, do not betray what you feel to everyone present! This is not the place for explanations-- 
MRS JENNINGS Come along, dear. 
They almost have to drag MARIANNE away. MRS JENNINGS turns back to the DASHWOOD party. FANNY and JOHN have practically imploded with embarrassment and are distancing themselves as much as possible from the source. LUCY and ROBERT are dancing nearby. 
MRS JENNINGS Will you come, Lucy? 
LUCY Oh, are we leaving so soon? 
ROBERT If I might be so bold, Mrs Jennings, it would be our pleasure to escort your young charge home. 
LUCY How very kind! 
MRS JENNINGS That is very handsome-- 
She rushes off to follow MARIANNE and ELINOR. We stay for a moment with LUCY and ROBERT who have left the set. 
ROBERT She actually sent him messages during the night? 
CAM rises to show the DASHWOODS exiting past the whispering, sneering faces of the CROWD. 
INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
MARIANNE sits scribbling a letter at the desk. 
ELINOR Marianne, please tell me-- 
MARIANNE Do not ask me questions! 
ELINOR You have no confidence in me. 
MARIANNE This reproach from you! You, who confide in no one. 
ELINOR I have nothing to tell. 
MARIANNE Nor I. We have neither of us anything to tell. I because I conceal nothing and you because you communicate nothing. 
INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY 
A silent breakfast. MARIANNE is red-eyed from crying and limp from lack of sleep. MRS JENNINGS is dressed to go out, pulling on her gloves and bustling as usual. PIGEON enters with a letter on a salver. He offers it to MARIANNE. She seizes it and runs out of the room. MRS JENNINGS chuckles. 
MRS JENNINGS There now! Lovers' quarrels are swift to heal! That letter will do the trick, mark my word. 
She goes to the door. 
MRS JENNINGS I must be off. I hope he won't keep her waiting much longer, Miss Dashwood. It hurts to see her looking so forlorn. 
ELINOR is seated at a desk writing a letter. There is a sudden rap at the front door. Footsteps are heard and as she turns, the maid enters with COLONEL BRANDON. ELINOR rises to greet him. 
ELINOR Thank you for coming, Colonel. 
He bows. ELINOR is on edge. BRANDON looks haggard with concern. 
COLONEL BRANDON How does your sister? 
ELINOR I must get her home as quickly as possible. The Palmers can take us as far as Cleveland, which is but a day from Barton-- 
COLONEL BRANDON Then permit me to accompany you and take you straight on from Cleveland to Barton myself. 
ELINOR takes his hands gratefully. 
ELINOR I confess that is precisely what I had hoped for. Marianne suffers cruelly, and what pains me most is how hard she tries to justify Mr Willoughby. But you know her disposition. 
After a moment BRANDON nods. He seems unable to remain still or calm and finds it difficult to begin speaking. 
COLONEL BRANDON Perhaps I--my regard for you all-- Miss Dashwood, will you allow me to prove it by relating some circumstances which nothing but an earnest desire of being useful-- 
ELINOR You have something to tell me of Mr Willoughby. 
COLONEL BRANDON (nods) When I quitted Barton last--but I must go further back. A short account of myself will be necessary. No doubt... no doubt Mrs Jennings has apprised you of certain events in my past--the sad outcome of my connection with a young woman named Eliza. 
ELINOR nods. 
COLONEL BRANDON What is not commonly known is that twenty years ago, Eliza bore an illegitimate child. The father, whoever he was, abandoned them. 
This is strong stuff. ELINOR's concern deepens. 
COLONEL BRANDON As she lay dying, she begged me to look after the child. Eliza died in my arms, broken, wasted away--ah! Miss Dashwood, such a subject-- untouched for so many years--it is dangerous... 
He paces about, barely able to conceal his distress. 
COLONEL BRANDON I had failed Eliza in every other way--I could not refuse her now. I took the child--Beth is her name-- and placed her with a family where I could be sure she would be well looked after. I saw her whenever I could. I saw that she was headstrong like her mother--and, God forgive me, I indulged her, I allowed her too much freedom. Almost a year ago, she disappeared. 
ELINOR Disappeared! 
COLONEL BRANDON I instigated a search but for eight months I was left to imagine the worst. At last, on the day of the Delaford picnic, I received the first news her. She was with child... and the blackguard who had-- 
BRANDON stops and looks straight at ELINOR. 
ELINOR Good God. Do you mean--Willoughby? 
BRANDON nods. ELINOR drops into a chair, utterly shocked. 
COLONEL BRANDON Before I could return to confront him, Lady Allen learned of his behaviour and turned him from the house. He beat a hasty retreat to London-- 
ELINOR Yes! He left us that morning, without any explanation! 
COLONEL BRANDON Lady Allen had annulled his legacy. He was left with next to nothing, and in danger of losing all that remained to his debtors-- 
ELINOR --and so abandoned Marianne for Miss Grey and her fifty thousand pounds. 
BRANDON is silent. ELINOR is breathless. 
ELINOR Have you seen Mr Willoughby since you learned...? 
BRANDON (nodding) We met by appointment, he to defend, I to punish his conduct. 
ELINOR stares at him, aghast. 
BRANDON We returned unwounded, so the meeting never got abroad. 
ELINOR nods and is silent for a moment. 
ELINOR Is Beth still in town? 
COLONEL BRANDON She has chosen to go into the country for her confinement. Such has been the unhappy resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter, and so imperfectly have I discharged my trust. 
A pause. 
COLONEL BRANDON I would not have burdened you, Miss Dashwood, had I not from my heart believed it might, in time, lessen your sister's regrets. 
BRANDON moves to the door and then stops. He turns to her and speaks with effort. 
COLONEL BRANDON I have described Mr Willoughby as the worst of libertines--but I have since learned from Lady Allen that he did mean to propose that day. Therefore I cannot deny that his intentions towards Marianne were honourable, and I feel certain he would have married her, had it not been for--for the money. 
She looks up at BRANDON. Silence. 
INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
MARIANNE is sitting on the bed staring into space. ELINOR is kneeling by her, holding her hands. 
ELINOR Dearest, was I right to tell you? 
MARIANNE Of course. 
ELINOR Whatever his past actions, whatever his present course, at least you may be certain that he loved you. 
MARIANNE But not enough. Not enough. 
INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - STUDY - DAY 
ELINOR sits alone with her head in her hands. Suddenly MRS JENNINGS hustles in looking pleased. 
LUCY jumps in like a shot. 
LUCY In that case perhaps you might escort me back to your sister's house, Mr Ferrars? 
There is an extremely awkward pause. 
EDWARD I would be honoured. Goodbye, Miss Dashwood, Miss Marianne. 
He shakes hands with ELINOR and with MARIANNE, who is silent with dismay. LUCY takes EDWARD's arm and looks up at him proprietorially. 
After a stiff bow and a muttered farewell from EDWARD, they leave. MARIANNE looks at her sister in astonishment. 
MARIANNE Why did you not urge him to stay? 
ELINOR He must have had his reasons for going. 
MARIANNE His reason was no doubt your coldness. If I were Edward I would assume you did not care for me at all. 
EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY 
A tranquil afternoon... 
INT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY 
LUCY is sitting with FANNY, who is doing some pointless basketwork. LUCY hands FANNY rushes. 
LUCY Poor Miss Marianne looked very badly t'other day. When I think of her, deserted and abandoned, it frightens me to think I shall never marry. 
FANNY Nonsense. You will marry far better than either of the Dashwood girls. 
LUCY How can that possibly be? 
FANNY You have ten times their sense and looks. 
LUCY But I have no dowry. 
FANNY There are qualities which will always make up for that, and you have them in abundance. It would not surprise me if you were to marry far and away beyond your expectations. 
LUCY I wish it might be so. There is a young man-- 
FANNY Ah ha! I am glad to hear of it. Is he of good breeding and fortune? 
LUCY Oh both--but his family would certainly oppose the match. 
FANNY Tush! They will allow it as soon as they see you, my dear. 
LUCY It is a very great secret. I have told no one in the world for fear of discovery. 
FANNY looks up, curious to know more. 
FANNY My dear, I am the soul of discretion. 
LUCY If I dared tell... 
FANNY I can assure you I am as silent as the grave. 
LUCY leans forward to whisper in FANNY's ear. 
EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - DAY 
We hold a long shot of the house for a moment of silence. Then from inside comes an almost inhumanly loud shriek. 
FANNY (V.O.) Viper in my bosom! 
EXT. JOHN AND FANNY'S TOWN HOUSE - BACK GARDEN - DAY 
FANNY is trying to drag LUCY out of the house. ROBERT and JOHN are trying to reason with her. FANNY loses her grip and falls backwards. LUCY flings herself into ROBERT's arms. ROBERT falls over. 
EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY 
MRS JENNINGS is running as fast as her fat little legs will carry her. 
EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BERKELEY STREET - DAY 
MRS JENNINGS pants up the front steps. 
INT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 
ELINOR and MARIANNE are packing. Their mood is gloomy and uncommunicative. MRS JENNINGS explodes into the room fighting for breath. 
MRS JENNINGS Oh, my dears! What a commotion! Mr Edward Ferrars--the very one I used to joke you about, Miss Dashwood-- has been engaged these five years to Lucy Steele! 
MARIANNE lets out a gasp. She looks at ELINOR, who nods at her in swift confirmation. 
MRS JENNINGS Poor Mr Ferrars! His mother, who by all accounts is very proud, demanded that he break the engagement on pain of disinheritance. But he has refused to break his promise to Lucy. He has stood by her, good man, and is cut off without a penny! She has settled it all irrevocably upon Mr Robert. But I cannot stop, I must go to Lucy. Your sister-in-law scolded her like any fury--drove her to hysterics. 
She leaves the room, still rabbiting on. There is a silence. 
MARIANNE How long have you known? 
ELINOR Since the evening Mrs Jennings offered to take us to London. 
MARIANNE Why did you not tell me? 
ELINOR Lucy told me in the strictest confidence. 
ELINOR Yes. He means it as testimony of his concern for--for the cruel situation in which you find yourselves. 
Now EDWARD sits--in shock. 
EDWARD Colonel Brandon give me a parish? Can it be possible? 
ELINOR The unkindness of your family has made you astonished to find friendship elsewhere. 
EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of growing comprehension. 
EDWARD No. Not to find it in you. I cannot be ignorant that to you--to your goodness--I owe it all. I feel it. I would express it if I could, but, as you know, I am no orator. 
ELINOR You are very much mistaken. I assure you that you owe it almost entirely to your own merit--I have had no hand in it. 
But EDWARD clearly believes she has been instrumental in the offer. He frowns slightly before speaking with rather an effort. 
EDWARD Colonel Brandon must be a man of great worth and respect ability. 
ELINOR finds some relief in saying at least one thing that she truly means. 
ELINOR He is the kindest and best of men. 
This makes EDWARD seem even more depressed. He sits silent for a moment but then rouses himself to action. 
EDWARD May I enquire why the Colonel did not tell me himself? 
ELINOR I think he felt it would be better coming from... a friend. 
EDWARD looks at ELINOR, his eyes full of sadness. 
EDWARD Your friendship has been the most important of my life. 
ELINOR You will always have it. 
EDWARD Forgive me. 
ELINOR Mr Ferrars, you honour your promises-- that is more important than anything else. I wish you--both--very happy. 
They rise. She curtsies. He bows. 
EDWARD Goodbye, Miss Dashwood. 
EDWARD leaves silently. ELINOR stands stock-still in the middle of the room. 
EXT. MRS JENNINGS'S HOUSE - DAY 
The PALMERS' carriage stands outside the house. COLONEL BRANDON helps MARIANNE in beside ELINOR before mounting his horse to ride alongside. MRS JENNINGS waves goodbye from the steps. The carriage moves off. MRS JENNINGS blows her nose, looks up and down the street in search of gossip and goes back indoors with a sigh. 
INT. THE PALMERS' CARRIAGE - ON THE ROAD - DAY 
MARIANNE is sitting back in her seat with her eyes closed. She does not look well. MR PALMER is behind his newspaper. 
CHARLOTTE What a stroke of luck for Lucy and Edward to find a parish so close to Barton! You will all be able to meet very often. That will cheer you up, Miss Marianne. I do declare I have never disliked a person so much as I do Mr Willoughby, for your sake. Insufferable man! To think we can see his insufferable house from the top of our hill! 
CLOSE on MARIANNE's eyes slowly opening. 
CHARLOTTE I shall ask Jackson to plant some very tall trees. 
MR PALMER (from behind the paper) You will do nothing of the sort. 
EXT. THE PALMERS' CARRIAGE - OPEN ROAD - DAY 
The carriage bowls along, with BRANDON riding next to it. 
CHARLOTTE (V.O.) I hear Miss Grey's bridal gown was everything of the finest--made in Paris, no less. I should have liked to see it, although I dare say it was a sorry affair, scalloped with ruffles--but what do the French know about fashion? 
EXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - AFTERNOON 
The carriage stands outside the PALMER residence, a resplendent affair with a great deal of land. BRANDON is helping MARIANNE and ELINOR out of the carriage. 
CHARLOTTE (V.O.) I am resolved never to mention Mr Willoughby's name again, and furthermore I shall tell everyone I meet what a good-for nothing he is. 
MR PALMER (V.O.) Be quiet. 
ELINOR and MARIANNE stand on the steps as the PALMERS debauch from the carriage amid a welter of SERVANTS. 
ELINOR (sotto voce) I do not think she drew breath from the moment we left London. It is my fault--I should have found some other way of getting home. 
MARIANNE There was no other way you said so yourself. 
ELINOR We shall be home soon enough. Mamma will comfort you, dearest. 
MARIANNE I am stiff from sitting so long. Will you tell Charlotte that I am going for a stroll? ELINOR glances at the sky in concern. 
ELINOR I think it is going to rain. 
MARIANNE No, no, it will not rain. 
ELINOR cannot help but smile at this return of the old MARIANNE. 
ELINOR You always say that and then it always does. 
MARIANNE I will keep to the garden, near the house. 
MARIANNE walks off. ELINOR watches her go anxiously. 
INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY 
CHARLOTTE is handing ELINOR a cup of tea. ELINOR turns back to look out of the window. She freezes. 
EXT. CLEVELAND - GARDEN - DAY 
ELINOR's POV of BRANDON walking up to the house with MARIANNE cradled in his arms. It is like seeing Willoughby's ghost. 
INT. CLEVELAND - HALL - DAY 
Everyone rushes out of the drawing room as the COLONEL enters with MARIANNE. He is exhausted and soaked. MARIANNE is dumb with cold and fatigue. 
COLONEL BRANDON She is not hurt--but we must get her warm! 
ELINOR and MR PALMER take MARIANNE from BRANDON and go upstairs, with CHARLOTTE in pursuit. 
EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT - RAIN 
The great house sits in darkness. A sense of foreboding. 
INT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
ELINOR is in her nightgown, knocking at a door. MR PALMER answers in his nightshirt, astonished to have been summoned out of bed. 
ELINOR I think Marianne may need a doctor. 
INT. CLEVELAND - BREAKFAST ROOM - DAY 
MR PALMER and CHARLOTTE are sitting at the breakfast table. BRANDON is pacing. The rain has stopped. 
CHARLOTTE You'll wear yourself out, Colonel! Do not worry! A day or two in bed will soon set her to rights! 
MR PALMER You can rely upon Harris, Colonel. I have never found a better physician. 
Enter ELINOR with DR HARRIS. 
COLONEL BRANDON (urgent) What is your diagnosis? 
DR HARRIS It is an infectious fever that has taken far more serious hold than I would have expected in one so young. I would recommend the hasty removal of your child, Mr Palmer-- 
CHARLOTTE runs out of the room screaming. 
CHARLOTTE Mrs Bunting! Mrs Bunting! 
EXT. CLEVELAND - FRONT STEPS - DAY 
CHARLOTTE is getting into their carriage with MRS BUNTING and BABY THOMAS. MR PALMER is on the steps with ELINOR. He takes her hand and looks at her with real sympathy. 
MR PALMER My dear Miss Dashwood, I am more sorry than I can say. If you would prefer me to stay I am at your service. 
ELINOR is touched to find this warm heart beneath his frosty exterior. 
ELINOR Mr Palmer, that is very kind. But Colonel Brandon and Dr Harris will look after us. Thank you for everything you have done. 
MR PALMER nods, presses her hand, and walks down the steps to the carriage. 
INT. CLEVELAND - DRAWING ROOM - DAY 
BRANDON sits head in hands. His ghosts have come to haunt him. 
INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - DAY 
MARIANNE is tossing and turning in the bed. DR HARRIS is trying to take her pulse. He looks up at ELINOR, who is watching anxiously. 
DR HARRIS She is not doing as well as I would like. 
INT. CLEVELAND - UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - DAY 
ELINOR exits the bedroom to find BRANDON outside. She jumps. 
COLONEL BRANDON What can I do? 
ELINOR Colonel, you have done so much already. 
COLONEL BRANDON Give me an occupation, Miss Dashwood, or I shall run mad. He is dangerously quiet. 
ELINOR She would be easier if her mother were here. 
COLONEL BRANDON Of course. Barton is but eight hours away. If I make no stop, you may see us early tomorrow morning. 
He takes ELINOR's hand and kisses it. 
COLONEL BRANDON In your hands I know she will be safe. 
EXT. CLEVELAND - DRIVE - EVE 
BRANDON mounts his horse, turns to look at the house for a moment, and then spurs it violently forward. 
INT. CLEVELAND - ELINOR AND MARIANNE'S BEDROOM - EVE 
ELINOR is by the window, having watched BRANDON's departure. DR HARRIS is by MARIANNE's side. He turns to ELINOR. 
DR HARRIS Double the number of drops and I will return as soon as I can. 
EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT 
MARIANNE Colonel Brandon. 
BRANDON turns back, his eyes full of tears. MARIANNE looks at him for a moment. Then, very quietly: 
MARIANNE Thank you. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN AND SURROUNDINGS - DAY 
The cottage nestles in the first buds of spring. A piece of rope hangs down from the branches of a tree in the garden. It starts to wave about wildly and we see MARGARET emerging and climbing down. She has built herself a new tree-house. 
COLONEL BRANDON (V.O.) What though the sea with waves continuall Doe eate the earth, it is no more at all. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
MARIANNE is on the sofa by the window. She is pale, convalescent and calm. Different somehow. She listens intently as BRANDON reads her the poem. 
COLONEL BRANDON Nor is the earth the lesse, or loseth aught. For whatsoever from one place doth fall, Is with the tide unto another brought... 
We move back to find MRS DASHWOOD and ELINOR at the other end of the room, sewing peacefully. 
MRS. DASHWOOD He certainly is nor so dashing as Willoughby but he has a far more pleasing countenance. There was always a something, if you remember, in Willoughby's eyes at times which I did not like. 
ELINOR listens patiently as her mother rewrites history. We cut back to BRANDON as he finishes reading. 
COLONEL BRANDON 'For there is nothing lost, but may be found, if sought... 
He looks up at MARIANNE. A soul-breathing glance. She smiles as he closes the book. 
MARIANNE Shall we continue tomorrow? 
COLONEL BRANDON No--for I must away. 
MARIANNE Away? Where? 
COLONEL BRANDON (teasing) That I cannot tell you. It is a secret. 
He rises to leave. 
MARIANNE (impulsive) But you will not stay away long? 
CLOSE on BRANDON's reaction.

ELINOR and MARIANNE are out on a walk. They go very slowly, MARIANNE leaning on ELINOR's arm. Their mood is loving, companion able. 
EXT. DOWNS NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY 
ELINOR and MARIANNE walk on. Suddenly, MARIANNE stops. 
MARIANNE There. 
She indicates a spot on the ground but ELINOR can see nothing and is momentarily alarmed. MARIANNE gazes at the ground and breathes in deeply. 
MARIANNE There I fell, and there I first saw Willoughby. 
ELINOR Poor Willoughby. He will always regret you. 
MARIANNE But does it follow that, had he chosen me, he would have been content? 
ELINOR looks at MARIANNE, surprised. 
MARIANNE He would have had a wife he loved but no money--and might soon have learned to rank the demands of his pocket-book far above the demands of his heart. 
ELINOR regards MARIANNE admiringly. MARIANNE smiles sadly. 
MARIANNE If his present regrets are half as painful as mine, he will suffer enough. 
ELINOR Do you compare your conduct with his? 
MARIANNE No. I compare it with what it ought to have been. I compare it with yours. 
ELINOR Our situations were very different. 
MARIANNE My illness has made me consider the past. I saw in my own behaviour nothing but imprudence--and worse. I was insolent and unjust to everyone-- 
ELINOR tries to stem the flow but MARIANNE continues. 
MARIANNE --but you--you I wronged above all. Only I knew your heart and its sorrows but even then I was never a grain more compassionate. I brought my illness upon myself--I wanted to destroy myself. And had I succeeded, what misery should I have caused you? 
ELINOR embraces her. They stand with their arms round one another in silence for a moment. Then MARIANNE breaks away and speaks with great good humour and energy. 
MARIANNE I shall mend my ways! I shall no longer worry others nor torture myself. I am determined to enter on a course of serious study---Colonel Brandon has promised me the run of his library and I shall read at least six hours a day. By the end of the year I expect to have improved my learning a very great deal. 
EXT. ROAD NEAR BARTON COTTAGE - DAY 
THOMAS is sitting on the back of a local wagon, holding a basket of food. 
He jumps off near the cottage and waves a cheery farewell to the DRIVER. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
CLOSE on the accounts book, covered in blots and crossed-out sums. Pull up to reveal MARIANNE labouring over it. Her sickness has left her slightly short-sighted and she uses a pince-nez that makes her look like an owl. 
ELINOR is sewing and MRS DASHWOOD is snoozing. MARGARET goes up and looks over MARIANNE's shoulder. She frowns at the spider's web of ink. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
They carry the piano into the parlour and to the DASHWOODS' joyful astonishment it fits perfectly. MRS DASHWOOD reads out the letter that has accompanied it. 
MRS DASHWOOD 'At last I have found a small enough instrument to fir the parlour. I expect to follow it in a day or two, by which time I expect you to have learned the enclosed. Your devoted friend, Christopher Brandon.' 
MRS DASHWOOD hands MARIANNE the letter and a broadsheet song. 
MARGARET He must like you very much, Marianne. 
MARIANNE It is not just for me! It is for all of us. 
All the same, she looks conscious of the truth. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN - DAY 
MARGARET is up her tree. ELINOR is pulling weeds. MRS DASHWOOD is sitting on a stool working on MARGARET's dress and listening to the strains of the new song which MARIANNE is singing in the cottage. All of a sudden, MRS DASHWOOD rises, shielding her eyes with her hand. She walks down to the gate, looking out. 
MRS DASHWOOD Here is Colonel Brandon! Marianne! 
The piano stops. MARIANNE comes out and they all gather at the gate to watch for the rider.

Their POV of a HORSEMAN in the distance. 
EXT. BARTON COTTAGE - GARDEN GATE - DAY 
ELINOR I do not think it is the Colonel. 
MRS DASHWOOD It must be. He said he would arrive today. You must play him the new song, Marianne. 
Suddenly there is a yell from MARGARET's tree. 
MARGARET Edward! 
MARGARET practically throws herself out of the tree onto the grass. 
MARGARET It is Edward! 
The women look at each other in complete consternation. 
MRS DASHWOOD Calm. We must be calm. 
INT. BARTON COTTAGE - PARLOUR - DAY 
Tense silence reigns. Everyone tries to busy themselves. BETSY enters. 
BETSY Mr Ferrars for you, ma'am. 
EDWARD follows her in, looking white and agitated. 
MRS DASHWOOD (rising) Edward! What a pleasure to see you. 
EDWARD Mrs Dashwood. Miss Marianne. Margaret. Miss Dashwood. I hope I find you all well. 
He bows formally to each of them, lingering on ELINOR, who is looking firmly at her lap. He looks anxious. 
MARIANNE Thank you, Edward, we are all very well. 
There is a pause while they all search for an appropriate remark. Finally MARGARET decides to have a go at polite conversation. 
MARGARET We have been enjoying very fine weather. 
MARIANNE looks at her incredulously. 
MARGARET Well, we have. 
EDWARD I am glad of it. The... the roads were very dry. 
MRS DASHWOOD decides to bite the bullet. 
MRS DASHWOOD (giving him her hand) May I wish you great joy, Edward. 
He takes her hand somewhat confusedly and accepts her offer of a seat. There is an awful silence. MARIANNE tries to help. 
MARIANNE I hope you have left Mrs Ferrars well? 
EDWARD Tolerably, thank you. 
There is another bone-crunching pause. 
EDWARD I--But EDWARD cannot seem to find any words. 
MRS DASHWOOD Is Mrs Ferrars at the new parish? 
EDWARD looks extremely confused. 
EDWARD No--my mother is in town. 
He plucks up the courage to look at ELINOR again and is evidently not much comforted by what he sees. 
MRS DASHWOOD I meant to enquire after Mrs Edward Ferrars. 
EDWARD colours. He hesitates.

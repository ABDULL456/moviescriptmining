VALERIE But he trusts you, Hafiz.. 
The temperature in the car drops a hundred degrees. 
HAFIZ How do you know my name? 
HAFIZ's brain does 0-60 in 0.06 Seconds. He flips open the glove box. Nothing there. 
VALERIE Your car was swept an hour ago. (He goes for the door.) Do not get out. If you get out of this car I can't protect you. 
HAFIZ STOPS DEAD. LOOKS IN THE REARVIEW: A black car, 50 yards behind. He grabs her arm. 
HAFIZ Who are you? 
VALERIE Let go of my arm Hafiz. NOW. 
HAFIZ                            VALERIE Who the fuck are you?           NOW! 
He releases her arm. She holds his gaze. Breathing hard. 
VALERIE Listen carefully. Your uncle is in business with Abu Domar Khan- 
HAFIZ                          VALERIE (Shaking his head            His company provides Khan smiling)                     with shipping, money That's bullshit.                laundering and contraband components. 
VALERIE Khan has made contact with a terror organisation via an aid agency in Pakistan. They are seeking materials to build a weapon. 
HAFIZ Fuck you. 
VALERIE (She fixes him) Your brother is in Kalutara jail in Colombo facing execution for trafficking. We can help him. 
HAFIZ                          VALERIE Bullshit. You can't help him.   We can help him. Hafiz. Listen to me. Listen. 
VALERIE You have to think straight here Hafiz. Because I promise you one thing... Right now, you have no idea what we can and cannot do. 
Hafiz looks in the rear view. At the floor. Deep inside something stirred. She saw it.. 
VALERIE We need information about your uncle. Contacts. Shipments. If you help us, we help you. If you don't, your brother dies and tomorrow you're sitting next to your uncle in a cell in Thailand and it won't be me asking the questions. 
Hafiz closes his eyes, head back. She watches him closely. 
VALERIE You will get a call at 8am. You'll be asked if you need a cleaner. You want her to come three mornings per week. Do you understand? I said DO YOU UNDERSTAND? 
INT. GEORGETOWN BAR. NIGHT.

SUE So after like six hours, he finally manages to stand up on the snowboard, and the instructor lets go of him and he just plummets.. (Laughter) I swear to god, he can't turn, slow down, for like four hundred yards. 
BILL And yet I'm incredible in bed.

STEVE So what do you do Valerie? 
VALERIE I work in Venture Capital. Brewster Jennings, here in Georgetown. 
STEVE Cool. So like net startups..? 
VALERIE Right. Retail and consumer.. Basically we create pooled investment vehicles.. 
STEVE Sounds high risk.. 
VALERIE I guess. But you know..high risk, high return. Pretty boring actually. So what do you do? 
JOE arrives back to the table with a tray of drinks. 
JOE                            DIANA They're out of Corona. I got    Me and Steve won't fly on the a Rolling Rock.                 same plane. We won't even get the same train together.

FLASHBACK -- THE RECEPTION. 1997. 
VALERIE I'm an energy consultant for a firm in Brussels. 
JOE And do you enjoy your work?

JOE (Sighs) OK. I'll work from home this morning. 
VALERIE Are you sure- 
JOE Relax. Me `n Spongebob are on it. 
The kids start fighting. She picks up her bag. 
JOE                            VALERIE Break it up. Trevor don't hit    We're having supper with the your sister.                     Mitchells Tuesday. But if you want to skip it they know you're busy- 
JOE I promise to behave. 
She stops. Melts. Kisses him. 
SAMANTHA I promise to behave. 
JOE See. We're all gonna be on our best behavior. 
She closes the front door. Joe looks momentarily marooned. He begins picking up soft toys off the floor.

An agent walks six analysts through a crowded open plan office. People squeezed in cubbyholes. Papers everywhere. 
CPD AGENT (CONT'D) We're the fastest growing division in the Agency, which sounds cool but means you may have to share a desk. Work like hell for years you may get your own cubbyhole. And if you're a workaholic, they make you boss, and you get- 
He knocks on a door. Opens it. Valerie comes bursting out. 
CPD AGENT Bad time? 
We follow Valerie into THE NEXT OFFICE-- where her colleague, Ali, 30s, Indian, is on the phone. 
VALERIE Hafiz hired a cleaner. 
ALI (Into phone) Gotta go. Kuala Lumpur just went live.

She takes them through a full whiteboard. 
VALERIE The shipment arrives in Joburg on the 21st. It's put in an unmarked container and shipped to the free trade zone in Dubai. Our asset meets there with the buyer on the 23rd. 
She tosses a spark gap to one of her team. 
VALERIE Dr Forster and his team at Los Alamos have altered the impedence timings of the spark gaps by a fraction of a nanosecond. Basically, they won't know it doesn't work til it doesn't work. 
ALI Can we put a wire on the asset? 
The door at the back opens. The Deputy of CPD enters with the Chief. Everybody sits up. Valerie continues.. 
VALERIE Too dangerous. This network has avoided detection for years. Expect meticulous operational security and counter surveillance. Any questions? 
They disperse. The deputy director of CDP buttonholes her.. 
DEPUTY CPD Val. The chief wants to see you. 
INT. CORRIDOR. LANGLEY. DAY.

VALERIE What about the Dubai op? 
BILL Mike says you got a hunch on the buyer. 
VALERIE Manucher Vaziri. Syrian National. Based out of Karachi. On a wire picked up in Cairo he talks about componentry from a known source in Pakistan he's moving to an unnamed Gulf state.. 
BILL Iraq? 
VALERIE Vaziri's devoutly Shia. Iraq's controlled by the Sunni. Saddam's Sunni. There's no way this is Iraq. 
BILL They're all good Muslims right? 
VALERIE And Martin Luther King and the KKK are both Christian. 
BILL Great job. From Monday, I need you both eyes on Iraq.

CNN is on in the background, low. State of the Union Address, 2002. Joe, working on something, recording voice notes, half- watching the President over his papers. 
PRESIDENT V/O (ON CNN) They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred.. 
ACROSS THE ROOM -- beneath a wall of well-thumbed tomes, two year old twins, TREVOR and SAMANTHA are lost in play. Trevor hauls in the flex of a globe lamp on a top shelf. 
PRESIDENT They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic. 
CRASH! -- Joe turns as the shelf GIVES WAY, and an avalanche of books and keepsakes buries his kids. Hollers. Tears. 
JOE (Rushes over) Hey hey hey. Everybody OK? Let's take a look at you. Four arms. Four legs. No broken bones. 
He lugs them out. The front door opens. It's Heather the babysitter. 
HEATHER Hey kids! Joe I'm sorry I'm late.

VALERIE It pays the rent. 
INT. BASEMENT, LANGLEY. DAY. 
Valerie leads Joe into a windowless room. MIKE. Five or six analysts. Agents from CIA and State Department. 
VALERIE This is Joe Wilson. Joe, this is Mike, the Deputy Chief of CPD. (They shake) I'll leave you guys to it. 
Businesslike, Valerie leaves. Joe sits. Silence. 
MIKE Mr Wilson, what can you tell us about Yellowcake? 
Joe looks around the room. Clears his throat. 
JOE I believe it's a concentrate obtained from uranium ore used to create fissile material for weapons programs. But I'm not a scientist. 
MIKE What about Niger? 
JOE The UN Human Development Index ranks Niger the number one Least Liveable country in the world. I started my Foreign Service there. As Ambassador to Gabon, I travelled back many times. Then as director of Africa policy for the NSC under President Clinton, I frequently visited, often met with Prime Minister Mayaki. I know the former foreign minister. I know the Minister of Mines. 
MIKE The Office of the Vice President has received a report concerning a memorandum of sale between the governments of Niger and Iraq for the purchase of five hundred tons of Yellowcake Uranium ore.. (He fixes Joe) (MORE) 
MIKE (cont'd) I don't have to tell you how serious this allegation is. 
JOE WILSON No Sir, you don't. 
He leans forward. 
MIKE This is a request from the Vice President. Can you help us?

INT. HOTEL ROOM, NAIMEY. DAY 
A tiny, hot cell. A sign on the bathroom door. "RED HOT SHOVER". Turns the ceiling fan on. Loud grinding.

JOE So it would seem. 
MINISTER So tell me. How can Niger help its old friend, America? 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, DIRECTORATE OF INTELLIGENCE. DAY. 
Several analysts sit around a table, including the LEAD ANALYST, PAUL. Two of them are the guys who were bad-mouthing Valerie. Another is JOE TURNER, a dough-faced offical from WINPAC (Weapons Intelligence Non Proliferaton and Control). 
JOE I can save the CIA some air fare here. There isn't a snowflakes chance in hell this thing happened. 
VALERIE Say who? 
JOE Says me. 
VALERIE What if you're wrong? One guy says it's true. It's not true. Lots of guys say it's true, it's still not true. It's intelligence. It's slow. Painstaking. But it works. Checks and balances. 
JOE What am I, a check or a balance? 
VALERIE Probably neither. You're a teeny tiny weeny cog in a giant machine. But you did your job. You should feel good. They count on that. That's why they don't pay you. 
JOE I'm not feeling that 007 right now. 
She puts her arms around his neck. Kisses him sexily. 
VALERIE I can get the kids to make you a medal, if it'll help. 
JOE Us double oh's are more about the gratuitous sex. 
VALERIE I'll see what I can do. 
They start making out.

TELEVISION FOOTAGE OF A PRESS CONFERENCE. 
JOURNALIST Mr. President, in your speeches now you rarely talk or mention Osama bin Laden. Why is that? 
INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE. DAY 
VALERIE leans over an analyst's desk as together they study photographs of a Syrian man in his sixties on the analysts screen.. The TV is on in the corner of the computer screen.. 
PRESIDENT ON TV The idea of focusing on one person indicates people don't understand the scope of the mission. Terror is bigger than one person. So I just don't spend that much time on him, Kelly, to be honest with you... 
Valerie looks up and stops. ACROSS THE FLOOR SCOOTER LIBBY, his assistant and TWO AIDES, walk past. Heads turn. 
VALERIE Why is the OVP here? 
INT. MIKE'S OFFICE. DAY. 
The Deputy director hears a knock. It's Valerie. 
VALERIE Mike. The Vice President's men are here. 
MIKE What the fuck? 
INT. BRIEFING ROOM. DAY. 
No windows. A lone analyst sits sweating bullets. LIBBY, spectacles on, thick folder open on his knee.. 
LIBBY My name is I. Lewis Libby. I'm the Chief of Staff to The Vice President. You are? 
ANALYST Dave. I'm an analyst. In non- proliferation. 
LIBBY What can you tell the Vice President about aluminium tubes? 
INT. CIA MESS HALL, 2ND FLOOR, LANGLEY. DAY 
Valerie and Mike queue up in the mess with JIM PAVITT, 52 the Deputy Director of the CIA. 
PAVITT Relax Mike. The Veep's just dotting the i's. 
MIKE Bullshit Jim. The only time a Vice President comes to Langley is to cut a fucking ribbon. 
PAVITT Look. Cheney doesn't trust us. This shit with Dick goes back thirty years. It'll blow over. (He turns to Valerie) Where are we on Iraq? 
VALERIE Behind the curve Sir. Most of the intel is outdated. We don't have a single operative or asset in the country. 
PAVITT What about geo-satellite imaging? 
VALERIE With respect sir, you can't look at this problem from space and make a call. 
PAVITT So talk to the defectors. 
VALERIE The defectors are unreliable. Most are supplied through a former asset the agency's had on a burn notice since `95. It's a racket. They walk in and get paid to say whatever the Pentagon wants to hear. 
PAVITT So we're blind. 
VALERIE We need sources we can rely on. We need to get in close. 
VALERIE So you're not Doctor Fallari. 
PROFESSOR AZIZ Madam. I've never even heard of this man. 
VALERIE You were not lead engineer at the Osirak nuclear installation outside Tikrit. You were never captured by the Mukhbarat escaping to Syria. You didn't spend three years in the Abu Dhan jail. 
PROFESSOR AZIZ This is absurd. 
VALERIE You weren't tortured. Broken. You didn't finally escape and arrive here in Cairo with nothing. 
PROFESSOR AZIZ No. 
VALERIE Dr. Al Fallari had two daughters. They were taken by Uday Hussein's private guard. He never saw them again. 
He stares at the floor. 
VALERIE That didn't happen. They never existed. 
He remains motionless. Valerie watches him closely. 
VALERIE I need names. Of your colleagues in the weapons programmes. The lives of hundreds of thousands of your people may depend upon it. 
He looks up at Valerie tears in his eyes 
VALERIE I know Tarif. I know what happened. 
He walks over to the window. SLOWLY he takes off his jacket. His shirt, pulls it off over his head and turns his back to her. He's been mutilated and burned all up his back. Slowly he turns. Deep scars. Burns. 
PROFESSOR You know nothing. 
EXT. CAIRO STREET. DUSK. 
Sunset. Traders are packing up. Valerie hurries into -- 
INT. SAFE HOUSE. CAIRO. DUSK. 
..up some rickety stairs and unlocks a graffiti covered door. Inside she takes out the notepad, her heart beating fast. On the page, A LIST OF NAMES. 
She pulls a ruggedized laptop from under the bed and pushes the plug into a bare wires socket. It fizzes. She starts to type the names into the computer.

MIKE at his desk. His secretary pops her head round the door. 
SECRETARY They're back. 
INT. BRIEFING ROOM. DAY. 
An analyst sits opposite Scooter Libby. He's so nervous he can barely open his eyes. 
ANALYST 1 The Iraqis were trying to buy the tubes off the internet. They spent three million dollars weather- proofing the tubes. Plus the tubes are roughly twice too long. Now you could argue that that's to disguise them, you could saw them in half. That's sixty thousand tubes. (Mimes sawing) I mean whew. Saddam's gonna get the mother of all blisters.. 
Laughs. Libby stares, unsmiling. Keeps sawing. Wishing to God he'd never started. 
OUTSIDE. 
The door opens and the analyst, white as a sheet, comes out. A couple of colleagues are waiting outside. 
ANALYST 2 How was it? 
ANALYST 1 Don't make jokes. 
ANALYST 1 drifts his way back to his desk. ANALYST 2 swallows, and disappears into the `interrogation' room. 
INT. BATHROOM. DAY. 
PAUL, the chief analyst, comes out of the stall. ANALYST 2 is there, throwing up in the sink. 
ANALYST 2 He thinks I don't know how serious it is.. weeks and weeks of fifteen hour days, we've gone back over and over it. 
PAUL OK. I'll handle this. 
CUT TO: 
Scooter listens patiently to PAUL, the chief analyst. 
PAUL And so apart from all the scepticism surrounding the specification, the analysis from the IAEA which I believe is numbered in the report.. (Stops. Changes tack) Mr Libby. Energy department nuclear scientists are among the most boring people on the planet. They can talk about gas centrifuges until you want to jump out of a window. And maybe once every ten years someone comes along and says "so, tell me about gas centrifuges". That's literally the only time you should listen to these guys. If they say an aluminium tube is not for a gas centrifuge it's like a fish talking about water. We've been over this data with you now five, six times. And... We don't really know how you want us to play this.. 
TACTICAL COMMANDER Say we drop in a light weight tac team outside the city. 
BILL You get through the checkpoints and roadblocks. You show up in my bedroom in the dead of the night with an armed tac team ask me to help out Uncle Sam? I'm going to react unpredictably. 
TACTICAL COMMANDER What about forcible extraction of two or three of the main targets? 
VALERIE No. We've got 29 names. I want to get to them all. 
TACTICAL     COMMANDER How? You can't use     the inspectors. You can't use tac.     The wall's too high Val. What are     you going to do. Train a mouse? 
VALERIE Maybe.

JOE It's three forty five.. 
VALERIE I gotta go. I have to be at the airport in forty five minutes. 
Joe, still half-asleep, catches up. 
JOE Well...how long this time? I mean... Do we need childcare for tomorrow- 
VALERIE I left a post-it by the lamp. Its all on the post-it. 
JOE Right. Its on the post-it. 
VALERIE I didn't want to wake you. (Senses something) Are you OK? 
JOE We've been leaving post-its for each other for months now.. we talk via Post-It. That fridge is like a dead letter drop. (Stops. Laughs) Jesus. Listen to me!. I sound like an old... Some- (He bangs the door) I don't know where you go. Who you meet. If you're in some jail, or lying in some ditch in Jordan, Beirut. And if you go missing, I can't tell anyone because you were never there. I'd never know what happened. I don't know where you go. 
VALERIE I'm going to Cleveland. 
He stops. Thunder-robbed. 
VALERIE I'll be home tonight. (Then) It's on the Post-It. 
She kisses him. They look at one another. 
JOE Have a nice day. 
She shuts the door, leaving Joe alone. He walks through to the kitchen, looks at the fridge, one by one he takes all the notes off, then, deliberately, drops them in the bin.

SAWSAN 1989. I attended a medical convention over there. Before that, in `83, he came here for an engineering conference. Twice in twenty five years. We try to stay in contact. It's difficult. 
VALERIE Would you like to go back and see him? 
SAWSAN holds her gaze. 
SAWSAN You want me to become a spy. 
Valerie and Ali enter the revolving doors and follow her at a distance across the shiny beige and gold marble floors. 
By the the check in desk for the Gulf Air flight to Baghdad stand TWO MOUSTACHIOED MEN in dark suits. 
Valerie and Ali have stopped in a electronic goods store. 
ALI Mukhbarat. Watching the flight desk on this side.

Sawsan reaches the desk and is stopped by the two men.

FRED It's a pretext! 50% of Americans think Saddam blew up the Towers- 
The table erupts in discussion, leaving Joe marooned. Valerie spots it instantly, as he broods. 
DIANA He's a threat. You can't tell me he's not a threat. 
LISA He's mad. Like Hitler. If we'd stopped Hitler in the thirties- 
Joe sits there. Fuming. 
FRED He's not Hitler. He's Saddam. We put him there. Why? It suited us. He's our fault. Always was. 
Right on cue, Joe rounds on the hapless FRED. 
JOE WILSON Have you met him? Fred. Have you met Saddam? Have you looked him in the eye? Did he threaten you? Did he threaten to kill you? You don't know Saddam. You don't know what you're talking about. 
Joe gets up. Joe walks out.

INT. UNIVERSITY OF BOSTON FRANKLIN THEATER. NIGHT. 
APPLAUSE. Joe sits on stage with three academic types. In the hundred seater auditorium, just a couple dozen or so students. 
PROFESSOR Ambassador Wilson is the last American diplomat to meet with Saddam Hussein. In 1990, when Saddam threatened to execute anyone sheltering foreigners, Wilson appeared at a press conference wearing a noose around his neck, declaring, "If the choice is to allow Americans to be taken hostage or be executed, I will bring my own fucking rope." Saddam backed down and Wilson evacuated several thousand. He came home and was taken to the Oval Office where the President introduced him to the War Cabinet as an American hero. 
JOE That's not quite true. It wasn't the Oval Office it was the Roosevelt Room. 
Laughter. 
INT. CORRIDOR. CPD. LANGLEY. DAY 
Valerie walks with MIKE and ALI, briefing him. 
VALERIE Sawsan's brother worked with five hundred scientists at the Safa factory. In `91 it was blanket bombed by B52s. Hussein Kamel, Saddam's son in law, kept the scientists together, threatening to kill them if they tried to leave. But sanctions destroyed the economy, and when Kamel was executed in `95, the team just drifted apart. They're all say the same thing Mike. Everyone. 
BACK TO: 
THE AUDITORIUM. 
A nervous history major stands. 
STUDENT Does Saddam pose an imminent threat to National Security? 
JOE I haven't seen the intelligence. I'm not qualified to comment. We have intelligence services working hard to assess just this. But I have met Saddam. I've looked him in the eye, so I can tell you what I saw. During a particularly vicious period of bloodletting in the late eighties, Saddam was asked by his foreign minister why he had executed a certain official who had been a loyal supporter. He said he would rather kill a friend in error than allow an enemy to live. For me, that is the mark of a monster.

INT. PRESS BRIEFING ROOM. DAY. 
Fleischer, on defence, before a packed house, buzzing. Everyone has Joe's article. 
MR. FLEISCHER: Look. There's zero, nada, nothing, new here. The President's statement in the State of the Union was much broader than the Niger question. 
JOURNALIST Is the President's statement correct? 
FLEISCHER: Yes, I see nothing that goes broader that would indicate that there was no basis to the President's broader statement. But specifically on the yellow cake, the yellow cake for Niger, we've acknowledged that that information did turn out to be a forgery. 
JOURNALIST 2 The President's statement was accurate?

CNN The U.S. military death toll in Iraq exceeded 2,000 this week, and the president's approval ratings are at the lowest point since he took office in 2001. 
MSNBC At a news conference, special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald declined to comment about Rove's involvement.

JOE WILSON How many of you know who put it in? (No hands.) How many of you know my wife's name? (Everyone in the hall.) How do you know one and not the other? (MORE) 
JOE WILSON (cont'd) How did the question move from "Why are we going to war?" to "Who is that man's wife". I asked the first question. Someone else asked the second. It worked. Its still working. Because we still don't know the truth. But you all know my wife's name. 
INT. TAXI (MOVING). DAY. 
Valerie sits in the back of a cab, looking out of the window. 
JOE WILSON V/O Public officials swear an oath to uphold the constitution. That is their duty. They must be kept to their oath. That is yours. This offense wasn't committed against me. Nor against my wife...

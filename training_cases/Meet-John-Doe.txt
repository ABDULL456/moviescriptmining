MEET JOHN DOE 
Written by Robert Riskin 
based on a story by Richard Connell and Robert Presnell 
Ext. Bulletin Office - Sidewalk. 
Close-up: Of a time-worn plaque against the side of a building. It reads: 
THE BULLETIN 
"A free press for a free people." 
While we read this, a pair of hands come in holding pneumatic chisel which immediately attacks the sign. As the lettering is being obliterated, 
Dissolve to: Close-up: A new plaque on which the lettering has been changed to: 
THE NEW BULLETIN 
"A streamlined newspaper for a streamlined era." 
Cut to: Int. Bulletin outer office. Full shot: Of a mid-western newspaper office. 
Med. shot: At a door at which a sign-painter works. He is painting HENRY CONNELL's name on the door. It opens and a flip office boy emerges. The painter has to wait until the door closes in order to resume his work. 
Full shot: Of the outer office. The activity of the office seems to suddenly cease, as all eyes are centered on the office boy. 
Med. shotpanning: With the office boywho has a small sheet of paper in his hand. He walks jauntily to a desk, refers to his paper, points his finger to a woman, emits a short whistle through his teeth, runs a finger across his throat and jerks his thumb toward managing editor's office. The woman stares starkly at him while her immediate neighbors look on with sympathy. The office boy now goes through the same procedure with several other people. All watch him, terror written in their eyes. 
Med. shot: Toward CONNELL's office door where painter works. It opens and three people emerge. Two men and a girl. The girl is young and pretty. All three look dourful. The painter again has to wait for the door to shut before resuming his work. The two men exit. The girl suddenly stops. 
Close shot: Of the girl. Her name is ANN MITCHELL. She stands, thinking, and then suddenly, impulsively, wheels around. Camera pans with her as she returns to CONNELL's office door, flings it open and disappears. The painter remains poised with his brush, waiting for the door to swing back. There is a slight flash of resentment in his eyes. 
Int. CONNELL's office. Full shot: CONNELL is behind his desk on which is a tray of sandwiches and a glass of milk, half gone. Near him sits POP DWYER, another veteran newspaperman. ANN crosses to CONNELL's desk. 
CONNELL 
(on phone) 
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay. 
ANN 
(supplicatingly) 
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . . 
Secretary enters. (Her name is Mattie.) 
SECRETARY 
More good luck telegrams. 
ANN 
Well, you know how it is, I, I've just got to keep working. See? 
CONNELL 
Sorry, sister. I was sent down here to clean house. I told yuh I can't use your column any more. It's lavender and old lace![1] 
(flicks dictograph button) 
MATTIE 
(over dictograph) 
Yeah? 
CONNELL 
Send those other people in. 
MATTIE 
(over dictograph) 
Okay. 
ANN 
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say. 
CONNELL 
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammersstart arguments. 
ANN 
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please. 
She can get no further, for several people enter. They are cowed and frightened. ANN hesitates a moment, then, there being nothing for her to do, she starts to exit. She is stopped by CONNELL's voice. 
CONNELL 
All right, come in, come in! Come in! 
(to Ann) 
Cashier's got your check. 
(back to others) 
Who are these people? Gibbs, Frowley, Cunningham, Jiles 
(to Ann at door) 
Hey, you, sister! 
Ann turns. 
CONNELL 
Don't forget to get out your last column before you pick up your check! 
ANN's eyes flash angrily as she exits. 
Int. Outer Office. Med. shot: ANN storms out. The painter again has to wait for the door to swing back to him. 
Int. ANN's office. Full shot: ANN enters her office and paces around, furious. A man in alpaca sleeve-bands enters. His name is JOE. 
JOE 
You're a couple o' sticks[2] shy in your column, Ann. 
ANN 
(ignores him, muttering . . .) 
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paperand forty heads are chopped off! 
JOE 
Did you get it, too? 
ANN 
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down! 
JOE 
Before you do, Ann, perhaps you'd better finish this column. 
ANN 
Yeah. Lavender and old lace! 
Suddenly she stops pacing. Her eyes widen as a fiendish idea strikes her. 
ANN 
Wait, Joewait! 
She flops down in front of her typewriter. 
ANN 
(muttering) 
Wants fireworks, huh? Okay! 
She begins to pound furiously, her jaw set. 
Close-up: Of ANN. Eyes flashing as she types. 
Close-up: Of JOE, watching her. The wild look in her eye and the unnatural speed of her typing causes him to stare dumbly at her. 
Med. shot: ANN bangs away madly. Finally she finishes. She whips the sheet out of the typewriter, hands it to JOE. 
ANN 
Here. 
As JOE takes it, ANN begins to empty the drawers of her desk. 
SECRETARY 
What? 
MAYOR 
Out the window! Something just flew by! 
SECRETARY 
I didn't see anything. 
MAYOR 
(semi-hysterical) 
Well, don't stand there, you idiot. Go and look. Open the window. Oh, why did he have to pick on my building? 
The SECRETARY, telephone in hand, peers out window. 
MAYOR 
Is there a crowd in the street? 
SECRETARY 
No, sir. 
MAYOR 
Then he may be caught on a ledge! Look again! 
SECRETARY 
I think it must have been a sea-gull. 
MAYOR 
A sea-gull? What's a sea-gull doing around the city hall? That's a bad omen, isn't it? 
(picks up Mrs. Brewster's phone) 
SECRETARY 
Oh, n-no, sir. The sea-gull is a lovely bird. 
MAYOR 
(into telephone) 
I-it's all right, Mrs. Brewster. It was just a sea-gull. 
(catches himself) 
Er. nothing's happened yet! No, I'm watching. Don't worry. Ju-just leave it all to me! 
The SECRETARY holds out another phone. The MAYOR drops MRS. BREWSTER's phone again, and her voice is still heard. 
MAYOR 
(into Spencer's phone) 
Spencer, I'll call you back. 
Secretary has gotten CONNELL on the phonehands phone to MAYOR. 
MAYOR 
Hello! Connell! This is 
(to Secretary) 
What are you doing? 
(back to phone) 
This is the Mayor. 
Int. CONNELL's office: Full shot: CONNELL is on the phone. POP DWYER is draped in a chair nearby. 
CONNELL 
Yes, Mayor Lovett! How many times are you gonna call me? I've got everybody and his brother and sister out looking for him. Did you see the box I'm running? 
He picks up the front page of the Bulletin; we see a four column box on the front page. 
CONNELL 
(reading) 
"An appeal to John Doe. 'Think it over, John. Life can be beautiful,' says Mayor. 'If you need a job, apply to the editor of this paper . . .'" " and so forth and so forth . . . Okay, Mayor. I'll let you know as soon as I have something! What? . . . Well, pull down the blinds! 
(he hangs up) 
The door opens and a man enters. His name is BEANY. Walks fast, talks fast and accomplishes nothing. Outside, we see the painter trying once more to get his sign painted. He reaches inand pulls the door to. 
BEANY 
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way. 
CONNELL 
Where is she? 
BEANY 
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that? 
CONNELL 
(controlling his patience) 
Did you find her? 
BEANY 
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean! 
CONNELL 
(barking) 
Go out and find her! 
BEANY 
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . . 
CONNELL picks up telephone. 
CONNELL 
Hello! . . . Yeh? 
BEANY 
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her. 
BEANY exits, knocking over an ash-stand. 
CONNELL 
(into phone) 
Holy smokes, Commissioner. You've had twenty-four hours! Okay, Hawkshaw, grab a pencil. Here it is again. She's about five foot five, brown eyes, light chestnut hair and as fine a pair of legs as . 
The door opens, ANN stands thereCONNELL sees her. 
CONNELL 
(into phonestaring at Ann) 
. . . ever walked into this office. 
Med. shot: At door. The sign painter is slowly beginning to lose patience. He again reaches inpulls the door shutglaring at ANN. 
Close-up: Of ANN. 
ANN 
(innocently) 
Did you want to see me? 
Wider shot: CONNELL, without moving, stares at her. 
CONNELL 
(quietlysizzling) 
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day. 
ANN 
I remember, distinctly, being fired. 
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do? He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river! But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why? Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard. 
CONNELL 
So? 
Full shot: Of the whole group. BEANY grins in admiration. CONNELL has leaned back in his chair, his eyes glued on ANN. 
ANN 
So! So he writes me a letter and I dig him up. He pours out his soul to me, and from now on we quote: "I protest, by John Doe." He protests against all the evils in the world; the greed, the lust, the hate, the fear, all of man's inhumanity to man. 
Arguments will start. Should he commit suicide or should he not! People will write in pleading with him. But no! No, sir! John Doe will remain adamant! On Christmas Eve, hot or cold, he goes! See? 
She finishes, takes a deep breathawed, and at the same time proud of her accomplishment. 
Close shot: Of CONNELL. He just stares at ANN. 
CONNELL 
(after a pausequietly) 
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve? 
ANN 
John Doe. 
CONNELL 
(loses controlscreams) 
What John Doe? 
ANN 
(screams right back) 
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead! 
There is silence for a moment. 
CONNELL 
(breaking silencespeaks with a controlled patience) 
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it? 
ANN 
(nodding) 
Well, you're catching on. 
CONNELL 
Who, for instance? 
ANN 
Anybody! Er, erBeany'll do! 
Close-up: BEANY. He is petrified. 
BEANY 
Why sureWho? Me? Jump off aOh, no! Any time but Christmas. I'm superstitious. 
Full shot: BEANY backs away from themand when he gets to the doormakes a dash for it. 
Int. Outer office: Med. shot: At door. As BEANY comes dashing out, he almost upsets the painter from the stool. When the door is shut, the name of "Connell" which he has been printing is all smudged over. The painter stares at it, helplessly for a second, and thenunable to stand it any more, rises, throws his brush violently to the floorafter completely smearing the sign himself. 
Full shot: 
CONNELL 
(sighing) 
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babiesbut stay out o' newspaper business! 
POP 
Better get that story in, Hank, it's getting late. 
ANN 
(to CONNELL) 
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place. 
CONNELL 
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman. 
He crosses to his desk just as NED enters from the back door. 
NED 
Look, Chief! Look what the Chronicle is running on John Doe. They say it's a fake! 
CONNELL turns sharply. 
Close-up: Of ANN. She was just about giving up, when she hears thisand her eyes brighten alertly. 
Med. shot: At CONNELL's desk. CONNELLreading the paperbecomes incensed. 
CONNELL 
Why, the no-goodlow-down 
(reading) 
"John Doe story amateur journalism. It's palpably phoney. It's a wonder anyone is taking it seriously." What do yuh think of those guys! 
ANN has walked into scene while CONNELL is reading. 
ANN 
That's fine! That's fine! Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this! 
CONNELL 
(doesn't like Ned hearing all this) 
That's all, Ned. Thank you. 
NED 
All right. 
NED, puzzled, exits. CONNELL comes away from his desk and walks around. 
CONNELL 
(fighting spirit) 
"Amateur journalism", huh? Why, the bunch of sophomores! I can teach them more about 
But he is interrupted by the front door being flung open. On the threshold stands BEANY. 
BEANY 
Hey, boss. Get a load of this. 
CONNELL 
(joins him in the doorway) 
What? 
BEANY 
Look! 
Med. shot: Over their shoulders. In the outer office are a large group of derelict-looking men. Some standingsome sittingsome leaning. It looks like the lobby of a flophouse had been transplanted. 
Close shot: Beany and Connell. 
CONNELL 
What do they want? 
BEANY 
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter. 
Med. shot: POP and ANN have walked over and also peer out. 
CONNELL 
(amused, turns) 
Oh, they all wrote the letter? 
ANN pushes CONNELL asidetalks to BEANY. 
Med. shot: To include the rest of them. They have their eyes glued on his face. ANN is very much interested. 
CONNELL 
How about family? Got any family? 
TALL CHAP 
(after a pause) 
No. 
CONNELL 
Oh, just traveling through, huh? 
TALL CHAP 
Yeah. Me and a friend of mine. He's outside. 
CONNELL nods to the others to join him in a huddle. He crosses to a corner. They follow. 
Close three shot: They speak in subdued voices. 
CONNELL 
Looks all right 
ANN 
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American! 
CONNELL 
I wish he had a family, though. 
POP 
Be less complicated without a family. 
ANN 
Look at that face. It's wonderful. They'll believe him . Come on. 
Close-up: Of TALL CHAP. He is a strange, bewildered figure. He knows he is being appraised, but doesn't know why. He fingers his hat nervously and looks around the room. Suddenly he is attracted by something. 
Close-up: Of tray of sandwiches on CONNELL's desk. 
Close-up: Of TALL CHAP. He swallows hard. His eyes stare at the sandwiches hungrily. 
Med. shot: Over his shoulder. Shooting toward the huddling group. It breaks up. They walk toward him. 
Med. shot: Another angle. 
CONNELL 
What's your name? 
TALL CHAP 
Willoughby. John Willoughby, Long John Willoughby they called me in baseball. 
ANN 
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money? 
JOHN 
Yeah, maybe. 
NOTE: Henceforth in this script he shall be referred to as JOHN DOE. 
ANN 
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letterand stick by it? 
JOHN 
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe. 
There is an appraising pause, and CONNELL again signals them to join him in a huddle. They exit to their corner. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. His eyes immediately go to the sandwiches. 
Close-up: Of tray, with sandwiches and milk, on desk. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. His eyes riveted on tray. He glances, speculatively, over toward them and then back to the tray. 
Med. shot: Of the huddled group. 
ANN 
That's our man. He's made to order. 
CONNELL 
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line. 
ANN 
(it's significant to her) 
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you. 
Suddenly, they are startled by a loud thud: they all look around sharply. 
ANN 
He's fainted! Get some water quickly! 
As all three rush to him. 
CONNELL 
Hurry up, Pop. 
ANN 
Oh. 
CONNELL 
(to John) 
Right here. Sit down. 
JOHN 
Huh? 
ANN 
Are you all right? 
JOHN 
Yeah, I'm all right. 
Dissolve to: Int. ANN's office. Close-up: Of JOHNsitting at ANN's desk, just completing a mealand still eating voraciously. 
Camera draws back and we find another bindle-stiff sitting beside JOHN, packing food away in silence. He is the friend JOHN referred to. He is much older and goes by the name of COLONEL. 
Camera continues to pull back revealing ANN who sits nearby, watching them sympathetically. 
Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL. They continue eating. JOHN glances up and catches ANN's eye. He smiles self-consciously. 
Close-up: Of ANN. She, too, smiles warmly. 
Med. shot: They continue to eat silently. 
ANN 
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you? 
COLONEL 
Say, all this John Doe business is batty, if yuh ask me. 
ANN 
Well, nobody asked yuh. 
COLONEL 
Trying to improve the world by jumping off buildings. You couldn't improve the world if the building jumped on you! 
JOHN 
(to Ann) 
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people. 
ANN 
He likes you well enough to stick around. 
BEANY 
Okay, fellas. 
Three bruisers stand in the doorway. 
BEANY 
Now, lemme see. You sit outside the door. Nobody comes in, see. You two fellas sit in here. 
As they reach for chairs, 
Cut to: Med. shot: JOHN is pleased as his gaze wanders around the room. 
JOHN 
Hey, pretty nifty, huh? 
COLONEL 
You ain't gonna get me to stay here. 
JOHN 
Sure, you are. 
COLONEL 
No, sir. That spot under the bridge where we slept last night's good enough for me. 
While he speaks, JOHN has managed to get a glimpse of himself in a mirroradmiring his new suit. 
BELL HOP 
Hey, what'll I do with this baggage? 
BEANY 
Aw, stick 'em in the bedroom. 
COLONEL 
Gimme mine. I ain't staying! You know we were headed for the Columbia River country before all this John Doe business came up. You remember that, don't yuh? 
JOHN 
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did. 
COLONEL 
Aw, Long John . . . I tell youit's no good. You're gonna get used to a lotta stuff that's gonna wreck you. Why, that fifty bucks in your pocket's beginning to show up on you already. And don't pull that on me neither! 
(as John brings out harmonica) 
JOHN 
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this. 
Wider shot: As BEANY enters scene with box of cigars. 
BEANY 
Here's some cigars the boss sent up. Have one. 
JOHN's eyes light up. 
JOHN 
Hey, cigars! 
He grabs one and stuffs it in his mouth. 
BEANY 
(to Colonel) 
Help yourself. 
COLONEL 
Naw. 
JOHN flops into a luxurious chairand immediately ANGELFACE holds a light up for his cigar. JOHN looks up, pleased. 
JOHN 
Say, I'll bet yuh even the Major Leaguers don't rate an outfit like this. 
ANGELFACE 
(hands him a newspaper) 
Here. Make yourself comfortable. 
(turns to the Colonel) 
Paper? 
COLONEL 
(sharply) 
I don't read no papers and I don't listen to radios either. I know the world's been shaved by a drunken barber and I don't have to read it. 
ANGELFACE backs away, puzzled. 
COLONEL 
(crosses to John) 
I've seen guys like you go under before. Guys that never had a worry. Then they got ahold of some dough and went goofy. The first thing that happens to a guy 
BEANY 
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom? 
JOHN 
No. 
BEANY beckons to him to follow, which JOHN does with great interest. 
Int. bedroom: Full shot: As BEANY and JOHN puff luxuriously on their cigars and examine the room. 
COLONEL 
(in doorway) 
The first thing that happens to a guy like thathe starts wantin' to go into restaurants and sit at a table and eat saladsand cup cakesand tea 
(disgusted) 
Boy, what that kinda food does to your system! 
JOHN pushes on the bed and is impressed with its softness. 
COLONEL 
The next thing the dope wants is a room. Yessir, a room with steam heat! And curtains and rugs 
and 'fore you know it, he's all softened up and he can't sleep 'less he has a bed. 
Close-up: Of BEANY. He stares, bewildered, at the COLONEL. 
Wider shot: JOHN turns and crosses to window. 
JOHN 
(as he goes) 
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me. 
COLONEL 
I seen plenty of fellers start out with fifty bucks and wind up with a bank account! 
BEANY 
(can't stand it any more) 
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway? 
COLONEL 
(ignoring him) 
And let me tell you, Long John. When you become a guy with a bank account, they got you. Yessir, they got you! 
BEANY 
Who's got him? 
COLONEL 
The heelots! 
JOHN hangs up. 
The COLONEL has just reached the door when it flies open and Ann comes in with photographer EDDIEshe sees JOHN all dressed up. 
ANN 
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town! 
EDDIE 
All set, Ann? 
ANN 
(coming out of it) 
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go. 
(she backs away) 
Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures. 
JOHN 
Action? 
ANN 
Um-hum. 
JOHN winds up in pitching posehis left leg lifted up high. 
EDDIE 
That's good. 
ANN 
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof. 
EDDIE 
Oh. 
ANN 
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better. 
Close shot: She combs his hairstraightens his tieetc. He inhales the fragrance of her hair and likes itwinks to the others. She poses JOHN's face and looks it over. 
ANN 
You know, he's got a nice face, hasn't he? 
ANGELFACE 
Yehhe's pretty. 
JOHN gives him a look and starts to get up slowly. 
ANN 
Here. Sit down! 
(to ANGELFACE) 
Quiet, egghead! 
(back to JOHN) 
All right, now, a serious expression. 
JOHN 
(laughing) 
Can't. I'm feeling too good. 
ANN 
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization. 
JOHN 
With all of it? 
ANN 
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now. 
JOHN 
Oh, crabby guy, huh? 
He tries scowling. 
ANN 
Yeah. No, no! 
(laughing) 
No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world! 
(the men laugh) 
JOHN 
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think 
ANN 
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest. 
JOHN 
Against what? 
ANN 
Against anything. Just protest. 
JOHN 
(laughing) 
You got me. 
ANN 
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do? 
JOHN 
(advances toward her) 
Oh, yuh did, huh? 
ANN 
Yes! 
JOHN 
Why can't you call right, you bone-headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot-bellied 
ANN 
Grab it, Eddie, grab it! 
Eddie takes the picture. 
A Montage: Of Newspaper inserts featuring John Doe's picture. 
"I protest against collapse of decency in the world." 
"I protest against corruption in local politics." 
"I protest against civic heads being in league with crime." 
"I protest against state relief being used as political football." 
"I protest against County Hospitals shutting out the needy." 
"I protest against all the brutality and slaughter in the world." 
Close-up: Superimposed over all of the above is a circulation chartshowing the circulation of the Bulletin in a constant rise. 
Dissolve to: Int. GOVERNOR's study: Med. shot: The GOVERNOR paces furiously. In front of him are several associates. 
GOVERNOR 
I don't care whose picture they're publishing. I still say that this John Doe person is a myth. And you can quote me on that. And I'm going to insist on his being produced for questioning. You know as well as I do that this whole thing is being engineered by a vicious man with a vicious purposeMr. D. B. Norton. 
As he finishes saying this, Dissolve to: Ext. D. B.'s estate: 
That's only the beginning. You play your cards right and you'll never have to worry about money again. Oh, I knew it. 
ANN'S eyes brighten with excitement. They are interrupted by the arrival of TED SHELDON, in uniform. 
D. B. 
(to TED) 
Hello. Whenever there's a pretty woman around, er 
(laughing) 
This is my nephew, Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell. 
ANN 
How do you do. 
TED 
How do you do! 
D. B. 
All right, Casanova. I'll give you a break. See that Miss Mitchell gets a car to take her home. 
TED 
Always reading my mind, aren't you? 
ANN 
(laughing) 
Thank you very much for everything. 
D. B. 
And, Miss MitchellI think from now on you'd better work directly with me. 
ANN 
Yes, sir. 
They exit. D. B. walks to the door, a pleased expression on his face. 
Close-up: Of D. B. His face wreathed in a victorious smile. 
Fade-out. 
Fade-in: Int. ANN's living room: Close shot: Of ANN. She sits at a typewriter reading something she has written. Suddenly, impulsively, she yanks the sheet out of the machine and flings it to the floor. As she rises, camera pulls back. We find the floor littered with previously unsuccessful attempts to get the speech written. For a moment, ANN paces agitatedly, until she is interrupted by a commotion. 
Med. Shot: At door. ANN's two sisters, IRENE and ELLEN, aged nine and elevenand dressed in their sleeping pajamas, dash in, squealing mischievously. Camera pans with them as they rush to ANN and leap on her. 
ANN 
Oh! Hey! Oh, hey! I thought you were asleep! 
ELLEN 
We just wanted to say good night, Sis. 
They embrace and kiss her. 
ANN 
Oh, oh! Oh, you little brats! You're just stalling. I said good night! 
Med. shot: At door. ANN'S MOTHER appears in the doorway. She is a prim little womanher clothes have a touch of the Victorian about themher hair is done up in old-fashioned style, her throat is modestly covered in lace. 
MOTHER 
(above the din) 
Come, come, come, children. It's past your bedtime. 
ELLEN 
Oh, all right. 
MOTHER 
Go on! 
ELLEN 
Come on, Pooch! Come on, come on. 
MOTHER 
Now, keep Pooch off the bed. 
The CHILDREN exit, squealing. ANN'S MOTHER goes to ANN's desk and searches for something. 
ANN 
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right. 
MOTHER 
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever. 
ANN 
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for? 
MOTHER 
Your purse. I need ten dollars. 
ANN 
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day. 
MOTHER 
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the houseand then this morning the Community Chest[7] lady came around and 
ANN 
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for? 
MOTHER 
The Websters. 
ANN 
The Websters! 
MOTHER 
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor 
ANN 
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves? 
MOTHER 
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now. 
ANN 
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away. 
Her MOTHER looks up, surprised at her tone. 
MRS. MITCHELL 
Oh, Ann, dear! 
Close-up: ANN realizes she has spoken sharply to her MOTHER and immediately regrets it. Her face softens. 
Med. shot: As ANN crosses to her MOTHERand places an arm around her shoulder, tenderly. 
ANN 
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies! 
MOTHER 
Do you mean the speech you're writing? 
ANN 
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell! I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good! 
MOTHER 
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen. 
ANN 
What? 
LUG 
What's the score, Angelface? 
ANGELFACE 
Three to twoour favor. 
LUG 
Gee, that's great! 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He has heard this and grins mischievously. He starts winding up for another pitch. 
Close-up: Of MIKE. He looks around mischievously, then turns to JOHN. 
MIKE 
You've got swell form. Must have been a pretty good pitcher. 
Wider shot: JOHN is just receiving the ball. 
JOHN 
Pretty good? Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game! 
MIKE 
Nineteen! 
JOHN 
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what? I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up. 
MIKE 
(picks up newspapersighing) 
That's too bad. 
JOHN 
What do you mean, too bad? 
MIKE 
(pretending distraction) 
Huh? Oh, that you'll never be able to play again. 
JOHN 
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a 
MIKE 
(interrupting carelessly) 
Well, you know how they are in baseballif a guy's mixed up in a racket 
JOHN 
(walking over) 
Racket? What do you mean? 
MIKE 
Well, I was just thinking about this John Doe business. Why, as soon as it comes out it's all a fake, you'll be washed up in baseball, won't you? 
JOHN 
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh! 
MIKE 
And another thing, what about all the kids in the country, the kids that idolize ball players? What are they gonna think about you? 
(shakes his head) 
Close shot: Of the COLONEL. He has dropped his gloveflopped into a chairand has taken out his ocarina. 
JOHN'S VOICE 
Hey, did you hear that, Colonel? 
The COLONEL nods, disinterestedly, and begins to play. 
Wider shot: JOHN ponders his dilemma for a second. 
JOHN 
I gotta figure some way out of this thing! 
COLONEL 
The elevators are still runnin'. 
MIKE 
(carelessly) 
I know one way you can do it. 
JOHN 
How? 
MIKE 
Well, when you get up on the radio, all you have to do is say the whole thing's a frame-up. Make you a hero sure as you're born! 
John thinks this over, but something troubles him. 
JOHN 
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed? 
MIKE 
Well, that's a cinch. I know somebody that'll give you five thousand dollars just to get up on the radio and tell the truth. 
COLONEL 
(eyes popping) 
Five thousand dollars? 
MIKE 
Yeah. Five thousand dollars. And he gets it right away. You don't have to wait till Christmas. 
COLONEL 
Look out, Long John! They're closing in on you! 
JOHN 
(ignores COLONEL) 
Say, who's putting up this dough? 
MIKE 
Feller runs the Chronicle . 
(takes it out of his pocket) 
Here's the speech you makeand it's all written out for you. 
JOHN takes it. 
Close-up: Of the COLONEL. 
COLONEL 
(eyes heaven-ward) 
Five thousand dollars! Holy mackerel! I can see the heelots comin'. The whole army of them! 
MIKE 
It's on the level. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. 
Dissolve to: Int. broadcasting station: 
Close shot: TELEPHONE OPERATORS. 
1ST GIRL 
No, I'm sorry. Tickets for the broadcast are all gone. Phone the Bulletin. 
2ND GIRL 
All right. I need one more. 
ANN 
Go right ahead. 
While there is this confusion, the COLONEL pushes in and stands in the doorway. 
COLONEL 
How're you doin'? 
CONNELL 
(calls to Beany outside) 
All right, Beanybring 'em in! 
While CONNELL speaks, two MIDGETS push the COLONEL out of the way and enter the room. The COLONEL glances downand nearly jumps out of his skin. BEANY follows them in. 
COLONEL 
Holy smoke! A half a heelot! 
BEANY 
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people. 
CONNELL 
Okay. Get them up. 
BEANY lifts them and places them, one on each of JOHN's arms. The flashlights go off. 
ANN 
This is ridiculous, Mr. Connell! Come on, give him a chance. The man's on the air! 
While she speaks, she tries to shove the photographers out. 
BOY MIDGET 
(to girl midget) 
Come on, Snooksyou better bail out. 
GIRL MIDGET 
(coquettishly) 
Goodbye, Mr. Doe! 
BEANY lifts her offand ANN pushes them all outjust as the STAGE MANAGER reappears. 
STAGE MANAGER 
Better get ready. One minute to go! 
Two shot: JOHN and ANN. ANN turns quickly to JOHN. 
ANN 
Wow! One minute to go, and the score is nothing to nothing! Now, please, John, you won't let me down, will you? Will you? 'Course you won't. If you'll just think of yourself as the real John Doe. 
Listen. Everything in that speech are things a certain man believed in. He was my father, John. And when he talked, people listened. They'll listen to you, too. 
Funnyyou know what my mother said the other night? She said to look into your eyesthat I'd see Father there. 
STAGE MANAGER 
Heywhat do you say? 
ANN 
Okay! We're coming. Come on! 
ANN 
Now, listen, John. You're a pitcher. Now, get in there and pitch! 
(kisses his cheek) 
Good luck. 
For a moment he just stares at her, under a spell. Then, turning, he exits. After a second of watching him, ANN follows. 
STUDIO OFFICIAL 
Give him room, let him through. Come on. 
Int. broadcasting stage: Med. shot: Camera retreats in front of JOHN and the official, as they leave the office and proceed to the microphones. Everyone stares curiously at JOHNwhispering to each other. 
Med. shot: Shooting through glass partition, toward control booth. We see the two men at the board. They glance nervously at their watchesthen at the clock on the wall. 
Close shot: Of ANN. She has taken a position at a table near the mike. Next to her sits CONNELL. ANN watches JOHN with intense interest. 
The COLONEL has followed JOHN up to the microphone. 
COLONEL 
(to John) 
Hey. Let's get out o' here. There's the door right there. 
M.C. 
Hey, what're you doing here? 
COLONEL 
That's what I'd like to know! 
M.C. 
Come on, out. Out. 
JOHN 
Say, he's a friend of mine. 
ANN 
(at John's elbow) 
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you. 
JOHN starts to follow ANN away from mike. ANN leads him back to mike again. 
ANN 
No, Johnover here. 
2ND M.C. 
Stand by. 
Med. shot: At door. The COLONEL surreptitiously tries the door, to see that it opens readily. Standing near him is BEANY and the others. 
Med. shot: Group around SPENCER. They wait expectantly. Their eyes sparkling with excitement. 
SPENCER 
Phone the Chronicle . Tell 'em to start getting those extras out. 
Med. shot: Toward control booth. The man with the earphones on has his hand up ready to give the signal. He listens a moment, then abruptly drops his hand. 
Close-up: The man near the announcer throws his hand up as a signal to someone off scene. 
Med. shot: An orchestra in a corner. The conductor waves his batonand the orchestra blasts out a dramatic fanfare. 
Close shot: ANNOUNCER and JOHN. ANNOUNCER holds his script up and the moment the music stops he speaks dramatically. 
ANNOUNCER 
(rapid-fire) 
And good evening, ladies and gentlemen. This is Kenneth Frye, speaking for the New Bulletin . Tonight we give you something entirely new and different. Standing beside me is the young man who has declared publicly that on Christmas Eve he intends to commit suicide, giving as his reasonquote: "I protest against the state of civilization." End quote. Ladies and gentlemen, the New Bulletin takes pleasure in presenting the man who is fast becoming the most talked-of person in the whole country, JOHN DOE! 
The man next to him waves his handthere is an outburst of music. 
A flash: Of ANNshe looks at JOHN intently. 
Med. shot: Group around BEANY. They all applaud, except for MIKE and the COLONEL. MIKE, with his hand hanging down, nudges the COLONEL. 
Close shot: Of their hands meeting and we see the envelope change hands. Camera pans up to the COLONEL's face which is twisted into a miserable grimace. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He glances around, uncertainly. 
Close shot: Of MIKE and the COLONEL. MIKE elbows the COLONEL to throw his signal. The COLONEL looks toward JOHN and nods his head. 
Close shot: Of JOHN. He catches the COLONEL'S signal and quickly his hand goes to his pocket. Just as he is about to bring it out, his hand pauses. He turns and looks at ANN. 
Close-up: Of ANN. A warm, pleading look in her eyes. 
Med. shot: Around JOHN. He is still staring at ANN, when the ANNOUNCER reaches over and nudges himpointing to the mike. JOHN snaps out of itturns his face to the mikepushes the paper back in his pocketand starts reading ANN'S speech. 
Now, you can't be a stranger to any guy that's on your own team. So tear down the fence that separates you, tear down the fence and you'll tear down a lot of hates and prejudices! Tear down all the fences in the country and you'll really have teamwork! 
Med. shot: Around BEANY and the LUGS. They, too, are interested. 
JOHN'S VOICE 
I know a lot of you are saying to yourselves: "He's asking for a miracle to happen. He's expecting people to change all of a sudden." Well, you're wrong. It's no miracle. It's no miracle because I see it happen once every year. And so do you. At Christmas time! There's something swell about the spirit of Christmas, to see what it does to people, all kinds of people . . . 
Close-up: Of ANN. Her eyes go from JOHN to the audienceas she watches their reaction. 
Full shot: Shooting toward audience over JOHN's shoulder. 
JOHN 
Now, why can't that spirit, that same warm Christmas spirit last the whole year round? Gosh, if it ever did, if each and every John Doe would make that spirit last three hundred and sixty-five days out of the year, we'd develop such a strength, we'd create such a tidal wave of good will, that no human force could stand against it. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He has become visibly affected by the speech himself. 
JOHN 
Yes, sir, my friends, the meek can only inherit the earth when the John Does start loving their neighbors. You'd better start right now. Don't wait till the game is called on account of darkness! Wake up, John Doe! You're the hope of the world! 
He has finishedbut does not move. He drops his head to conceal the moisture in his eyes. 
Close-up: Of ANN. She, too, remains seated. Her moist eyes riveted on JOHN. 
Med. long shot: Of Audience. There is no outburst of applause. All continue to stare forward, emotionally touched. 
Med. shot: Of ANN. She runs over to John. 
ANN 
John! You were wonderful! 
Med. shot: Of the audience. They too realize it is overand gradually they rise and applaud him wildly, and the radio station rings with cheers. 
Med. shot: JOHN and ANN. JOHN stares at ANN, then turns to COLONEL. 
JOHN 
(as he reaches COLONEL) 
Let's get out of here. 
They exit through the door at which the COLONEL has been on guard. 
COLONEL 
Now you're talking! 
Med. shot: At side door. The COLONEL opens it, and a little crowd of autograph hounds wait for JOHN. 
COLONEL 
Gangway, you heelots! 
They push their way to a taxi waiting at the curb. 
Close-up: Of ANN. She stares at them leaving, follows and tries to stop them, but her efforts are unsuccessful. 
Dissolve to: Ext. under a bridge: Med. shot: JOHN and the COLONEL are in a secluded spot. The lights of the city can be seen in the distance. The COLONEL is building a fire. 
COLONEL 
I knew you'd wake up sooner or later! Boy, am I glad we got out of that mess. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He reaches around and pulls his pitcher's glove out of his back pocket, and starts pounding his fist into it. 
JOHN 
I had that five thousand bucks sewed up! Could have been on my way to old Doc Brown! 
(imitates Ann) 
"You're a pitcher, John," she said, "Now go in there and pitch! 
(self-beratingly) 
What a sucker! 
Wider shot: To include the COLONEL, who has quite a mound of twigs built, under which he lights a match. 
COLONEL 
Yeah, she's a heelot just like the rest of them. It's lucky you got away from her. 
JOHN 
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh? Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . . 
COLONEL 
Tear down all the fences. Why, if you tore one picket off of your neighbor's fence he'd sue you! 
JOHN 
Five thousand bucks! I had it right in my hand! 
Dissolve to: Int. D.B.'s study: Close-up: D.B. on telephone. 
D.B. 
What do you mean, he ran away? Well, go after him! Find him! That man is terrific! 
Dissolve to: Ext. a box car (process). Close shot: Of JOHN and the COLONEL. They play a duet on their instruments. 
Fade out: 
Fade in: Ext. a small town streetday: Med. shot: As JOHN and the COLONEL come from around a corner. Camera pans with them as they enter "Dan's Beanery". 
Int. DAN's Beanery: Full shot: They enter and flop down on stools. Half a dozen other customers are present. 
Med. shot: Kids dancing to phonograph. 
COLONEL 
Jitterbugs.[9] 
Close shot: JOHN and the COLONEL. 
JOHN 
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left? 
COLONEL 
Four bits. 
JOHN 
Better make it doughnuts, huh? 
COLONEL 
Yeh. 
DAN 
What'll it be, gents? 
JOHN 
Have you got a coupla steaks about that big and about that thick? 
(measuring) 
COLONEL 
Er, yeh, with hash-brown potatoes and tomatoes andand apple pie and ice cream and coffee 
DAN 
And doughnuts! I know. Hey, Ma! Sinkers, a pair! 
MA'S VOICE 
Sinkers, a pair, coming up. 
COLONEL 
Glad he took the "T" out of that. 
JOHN 
(sees something offnudges the Colonel) 
Hey look! 
Long shot: Shooting from their view through the store window. In the street outside, a delivery wagon is passing. On its side is a sign reading "JOIN THE JOHN DOE CLUB". 
Int. DAN's beanery: Close-up: JOHN and the COLONEL. 
COLONEL 
Join the John Doe Club. 
Med. shot: Around BERT. He looks over at JOHN, hesitates a moment, and then speaks. 
BERT 
Well, er, the reason we wanted to tell you this, Mr. Doe, was to give you an idea what you started. And from where I'm sitting, I don't see any sense in your jumping off any building. 
GROUP 
No! 
SOURPUSS 
No! 
BERT 
Well, thank you for listening. Goodbye, Mr. Doe. You're a wonderful man and it strikes me you can be mighty useful walking around for a while. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. Deeply touched. Shifts awkwardly, unable to say anything. 
Med. shot: As D. B. and ANN watch his face to see the effect. 
GROUP 
Well, goodbye. 
SOURPUSS 
Goodbye Mr. Doe. 
BERT has turned to go, and the rest follow suit. They all shuffle silently out. 
Med. shot: Of an old couple who remain looking up at JOHN, as those around them leave. The old lady takes the old man's arm and starts toward JOHN. Camera pans with them until they reach him. 
OLD LADY 
I'm Mrs. Delaney, Mr. Doe . . . and God bless you, my boy. 
(she gently kisses his hand) 
The two OLD PEOPLE leave. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He swallows a lump in his throat. He watches the old people until they have left, then with a quick glance at his handand self-consciously in front of the others, stuffs his hand into his pocket. 
Full shot: As they all watch him, without speaking. JOHN runs his hand through his hair, stealing a fleeting glance at the others, and grins awkwardly. 
Close shot: Of D. B. as he signals to the MAYOR and the SHERIFF, who have remained, to leave. 
Med. shot: Of the MAYOR and the SHERIFF, who receive the signal and discreetly exit. 
Full shot: They wait for JOHN to speak, but JOHN begins walking around, profoundly thoughtful. 
Close-up: Of the COLONEL watching him, concerned. 
Two shot: Of D. B. and ANN. Their eyes glued on him, expectantly. 
Full shot: JOHN still paces, disturbed by clashing emotions. He stops, glances at the door, a soft, thoughtful expression in his eyes. Then, as his thought shifts, he runs his left hand over his pitching arm. 
JOHN 
Gee, whizI'm all mixed upI don't get it. Look, all those swell people think I'm gonna jump off a building or something. 
He looks toward the door. 
JOHN 
I never had any such idea. Gosh! A fella'd have to be a mighty fine example himself to go around telling other people how toSay, look, what happened the other night was on account of Miss Mitchell, here. She wrote the stuff. 
ANN walks over to JOHN. 
Two shot: ANN and JOHN. She faces him, looking up into his face. 
ANN 
Don't you see what a wonderful thing this can be? 
(softly) 
But we need you , John. 
Close-up: Of the COLONEL. He stares at JOHN, sees him weakening, and grimaces disgustedly. 
Wider shot: The COLONEL watches JOHN as he continues to turn it over in his mind. 
COLONEL 
(suddenly) 
You're hooked! I can see that right now. 
They all look up, startled. 
COLONEL 
They got you. Well, I'm through. 
(crosses to doorstops, turns) 
For three years I've been trying to get you up to the Columbia River country. First, it was your glass arm. Then it was the radio. And now it's the John Doe clubs. Well, I ain't waiting another minute. 
He opens the door and when he sees the townspeople still gathered outside, he yells to them. 
COLONEL 
Gangway, you heelots! 
He pushes his way out. 
JOHN 
(calling) 
Hey, Colonel! Wait a minute! 
He starts after the COLONEL, but when he gets to the door, the townspeople surge toward him and block his way. 
JOHN 
Hey, Colonel! 
CROWD 
Oh, please, Mr. Doe 
Close-up: Of JOHN. 
JOHN 
(calling futilely) 
Hey, Colonel! 
He tries to peer over the heads of the townspeople who go on chattering. There is a trapped look on JOHN's face. 
Two shot: D. B. and ANN. They exchange victorious glances: 
Dissolve to: Int. office of headquarters. Close shot: Of large map of the U.S. over the top of which we read: "John Doe Clubs." There are a dozen pegs scattered over the map, indicating where the clubs are. We hear D. B.'s voice. 
Camera draws back and we find D. B. talking to a group of men in front of him. 
D. B. 
I want you personally to go along with John Doe and Miss Mitchell and handle the press and the radio. 
CHARLIE 
(an experienced promoter) 
Me? 
D. B. 
Yes. I don't want to take any chances. And Johnson? 
JOHNSON 
Yes. D. B. 
D. B. 
Your crew will do the mop up job. They'll follow John Doe into every town, see that the clubs are properly organized and the charters issued. 
CHARLIE 
Right. 
D. B. 
There are only eight flags up there now. I want to see that map covered before we get through! 
Med. shot: D. B. is still speaking as camera moves down to the map again, which constantly remains a background for the montage following. As the montage proceeds, pegs begin to appear in abundance on the map. 
A montage: Accompanied by a fanfare of music. 
1. Flashes of banners reading: 
He'll be ready on time. He's packing now. 
CHARLIE 
Ah, good! 
(crosses to Ann) 
Did you see his picture on the cover of Time ? 
ANN 
Yeah. 
CHARLIE drops the magazine on the desk in front of her. ANN glances at it, unenthusiastically. CHARLIE goes to a table where there are several bottles of coca-cola and starts to pour himself a drink. 
CHARLIE 
I gotta give you credit, Annie-girl. I've handled a good many big promotions in my time . . . everything from the world's fair to a channel swimmer, but this one has certainly got me spinning. And now a John Doe Convention! Wow! Say! If you could only get him to jump off the City Hall roof on Christmas Eve, I'd guarantee you half a million people there. 
ANN 
Charlie! 
ANN is lost in troubled thought. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE 
Huh? 
ANN 
(nods toward door) 
What do you make of him? 
Two shot: CHARLIE and ANN. 
CHARLIE 
Who, Johnny-boy? 
ANN nods. 
CHARLIE 
Well, I don't know what angle you want, but I'll give it to you quick. Number one, he's got great yokel appeal; but he's a nice guy. Number two, he's beginning to believe he really wrote that original suicide letter that you made up. Number three, he thinks that you're Joan of Arc or something! 
Close-up: Of ANN. This is definitely troublesome to her. 
ANN 
(hoarsely) 
Yeah, I know. 
Wider shot: ANN walks awaypacing perturbedly. 
CHARLIE 
Number four, well, you know what number four is. He's nuts about you. Yeah, it's running out of his ears. 
ANN runs her hand through her hair. Suddenly she wheels around to CHARLIE. 
ANN 
You left out number five. We're all heels, me especially. 
She returns to her packing. CHARLIE watches her a second. 
CHARLIE 
Holy smoke! 
They are interrupted by a knock on the door. 
ANN 
(calling) 
Come in. 
JOHN enters, carrying a suitcase. 
JOHN 
I'm all packed. 
CHARLIE 
(starts out) 
Good. I'll go and get Beany-boy. 
JOHN 
(kidding him) 
Okay, Charlie-boy! 
CHARLIE 
Huh? 
(laughing)[10] 
CHARLIE winks good-naturedly and exits. JOHN turns to ANN, who concentrates on her packing. 
Med. shot: He looks at ANN with great interest, and walks toward her, camera panning with him. ANN feels him coming, but does not turn. 
JOHN 
(after a pause) 
Can I help you pack? 
ANN 
No, thank you. 
JOHN wanders over to a chair and sits on the edgewatching her. 
Close-up: Of ANN. She is conscious of his eyes on her and fumbles with her packing. Finally she turns. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He stares at her, a warm smile on his face. 
Close-up: Of ANN. She becomes self-conscious and resumes her packing. 
Med. shot: JOHN. 
JOHN 
Do you care if I sit down out here? 
ANN 
No. 
A broad smile appears on JOHN'S face. 
JOHN 
(laughing) 
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you. 
ANN 
About me? 
JOHN 
(laughing) 
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father. 
Close-up: Of ANN. The fact that he has seen himself in the image of her father disturbs her. She turns slowly. 
Two shot: JOHN clears his throat nervously. 
JOHN 
There was, there was something I was trying to stop you from doing. So, er, so I got up out of bed and I walked right through the wall here, right straight into your room. 
(laughing) 
You know how dreams are. 
ANN stares at himfearful of the trend his dream is taking. 
JOHN 
And there you were in bed. 
(quickly apologizing) 
MRS. MITCHELL 
You mean you'd like me to do it, huh? 
JOHN 
Well, I was thinking thatYeah, you know, sort of break the ice. 
Close-up of MOTHER. She doesn't know how she can, with her present strained relationship with ANN, but JOHN's sincerity touches her. 
MOTHER 
Of course I will, John. 
Two shot: JOHN's face lights up, gratefully. 
JOHN 
Gee whiz! Thank you, Mrs. Mitchell. 
(grabs her hand) 
Gee, you'reuhyou're okay! 
He exits from scenebut almost immediately he is back. He plants a kiss on her cheek and goes. 
Cut to: Ext. sidewalk. Front of ANN's apartment. Med. Shot: An automobile stands at the curb, in front of which is BEANY. Also waiting, are four motorcycle policeman. 
BEANY 
(to the other men) 
This John Doe meeting is gonna be one of the biggest things that ever happened. 
As JOHN appears in the doorway of the apartment house, he pretends to throw a baseball at them. 
BEANY 
Why, they're coming from all over; trains, box cars, wagons 
(sees JOHN) 
look out! 
Med. Shot: Reverse angle. As BEANY holds the door open for JOHN. 
JOHN 
Hello, bodyguards! Hey, had your dinner yet? 
BODYGUARD 
Not yet. 
JOHN 
Well, look. No. Go ahead and have your dinner. I'll 
He is about to enter the car when a voice from off-scene stops him. 
CONNELL'S VOICE 
Wait a minute, John. 
Camera pans over to a taxicab which has just driven in. CONNELL hands the driver a bill and walks, rather unsteadily toward JOHN. 
Med. shot: Around BEANY's car. CONNELL ambles into the scene. 
JOHN 
Hello, Mr. Connell. 
CONNELL 
Hiyah, John. 
(broad wink) 
John, I want to have a little talk with you. 
(lurchesJohn holds him up) 
What's the matterare you falling? Come here. 
Takes his arm to lead him off. 
BEANY 
(protesting) 
Hey, Boss. 
CONNELL 
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet. 
(to John) 
Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight? 
JOHN 
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way. 
CONNELL 
(wisely) 
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk. 
BEANY 
(protesting) 
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute. 
CONNELL 
(shooing him away) 
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street. 
He points in the general direction and again takes JOHN's arm. JOHN watches him, rather amused to see CONNELL off his milk diet, and allows himself to be led away. 
Wipe to: Int. a barroom. Close shot: In a corner booth, JOHN and CONNELL sit, close together, drinks in front of them. JOHN's drink has remained untouched. CONNELL is just taking a long swig. From off-scene we hear the strains of an old-fashioned torch ballad, coming from an automatic piano. 
CONNELL 
(after a pause) 
You're a nice guy, John. I like you. You're gentle. I like gentle people. Me? I'm hardhard and tough. 
(shakes his headdisparagingly) 
I got no use for hard people. Gotta be gentle to suit me. Like you, for instance. 
JOHN smiles, amused at him. CONNELL starts to light his cigarette, which is bent. He hold the match up, but it never reaches the tip of the bent cigarette. He puffs, satisfied. 
CONNELL 
Yep, I'm hard. But you want to know something? I've got a weakness. You'd never guess that, would you? Well, I have. Want to know what it is? 
JOHN nods. 
CONNELL 
The Star Spangled Banner. 
(looks directly at John) 
Screwy, huh? 
(turns back to his glass) 
Well, maybe it is. But play the "Star Spangled Banner"and I'm a sucker for it. It always gets me right here 
(thumps his diaphragm) 
You know what I mean? 
Close-up: Of JOHN. His face has become serious. 
JOHN 
Yeah. 
(points to back of neck) 
It gets me right back here. 
Two shot: JOHN and CONNELL. CONNELL speculates about this with his head cocked. 
CONNELL 
Oh, back there, huh? 
Two shot: JOHN and CONNELL. 
CONNELL 
(emphatically) 
I'm not talking about his grandfather's pet poodle! 
CONNELL again makes an effort to light his bent cigaretteand again is unsuccessful. 
JOHN 
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs. 
CONNELL 
(sarcastically) 
Yeah? 
(suddenly) 
Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you? 
JOHN 
Sure. 
CONNELL 
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I. 
Close-up: Of CONNELL. 
CONNELL 
(sincerely) 
It's a beautiful miracle. A miracle that could only happen right here in the good old U.S.A. And I think it's terrific! What do you think of that! Me! Hard-boiled Connell! I think it's plenty terrific! 
Two shot: John is rather pleased to hear him say this. 
CONNELL 
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh? 
JOHN 
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea. 
CONNELL 
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does! 
(snorting) 
Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight! 
JOHN 
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff. 
CONNELL 
(cynically) 
They can't, huh? 
(then barking) 
Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. His jaw stiffens, angrily. 
CONNELL'S VOICE 
And get a big bonus for doing them, too. A mink coat and a diamond bracelet. 
JOHN glares at him, his rage mounting. 
Close-up: Of CONNELL. Unaware of JOHN's wrath. 
CONNELL 
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold-grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen! 
JOHN 
(in an outraged outcry) 
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd 
Simultaneously his hand comes in and grabs the startled CONNELL violently by his shirt front, lifting him out of his seat. Camera pulls back to include JOHNwho towers over CONNELL. 
Wider shot: JOHN is still holding CONNELL, glaring down at him, enraged, when BEANY runs into the scene. 
BEANY 
(holding out the envelope) 
Hey, Boss! Here's the speech, Boss. 
Suddenly he sees what's happening, and stares open-mouthed. 
BEANY 
Hey! 
Med. shot: As JOHN pushes CONNELL back into the seat, snatches the envelope from BEANY, and exits. 
CONNELL 
Go on and read it, John, and then start socking! 
Wider shot: As JOHN exits from place. BEANY suddenly realizes he has goneand chases after him. 
BEANY 
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe! 
CONNELL 
. . . Tubby? 
BEANY'S VOICE 
Yes, sir? 
CONNELL 
Better bring me a glass of milk. 
Close-up: Of CONNELL. He stares at his unlighted cigarettegrimaces unhappily. 
CONNELL 
(mumbling) 
I'm smoking too much. 
He grinds out the unlighted cigarette in the tray. 
Dissolve to: Int. D. B.'s dining room. Close shot: Of D. B., who is at head of table, talking on phone. 
D. B. 
(into telephone) 
. . . Yes, Charlie? You've got everything all set? Fine! Has John Doe been taken care of? Good! How many people do you think will be there? 
A pleased expression comes over his face. 
D. B. 
Fifteen thousand? Oh my, that's fine. Now, listen, Charlie, as soon as John Doe stops talking about me, I want you to start that demonstration. And make it a big one, you understand? 
As D. B. hangs up. 
Wider shot: Including TED SHELDON. 
TED 
Don't worry about that, D. B. My boys are there. They'll take care of it. 
D. B. 
(into telephone) 
What? yes, I'll be there fifteen minutes after I get your call. 
Camera draws back as he speaks. We see that dinner has been concluded. His listeners, besides TED and ANN, are half a dozen distinguished looking men, some with cigars stuck in their mouths, others sip from champagne glasses. ANN sits to D. B.'s right. 
Cut to: Int. foyer: Med. shot: At D. B.'s front door. A butler is opening the door for JOHN. 
BUTLER 
Is there anything wrong? 
JOHN 
(after a pause) 
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine! So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh? 
(turns toward D. B.) 
You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shotyou forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body! 
D. B. 
Now, hold on a minute, young man! Hold on! That's rather big talk! I started the John Doe clubs with my money and I'll decide whether or not they're being properly used! 
JOHN 
No you won't! You're through deciding anything! 
D. B. cannot believe his ears. 
JOHN 
And what's more, I'm going down to that convention and I'm gonna tell those people exactly what you and all your fine-feathered friends here are trying to cook up for them! 
He looks up at ANNand starts tearing the speech in his hand. 
JOHN 
(strongly) 
And I'll say it in my own words this time. 
He flings the torn paper toward ANNand starts out. 
HAMMETT AND OTHERS 
Stop him, somebody! He'll ruin us, D. B.! 
Med. shot: At Door. As JOHN reaches it, TED steps up in front of him. 
TED 
(menacingly) 
Wait a minute, young fellermy uncle wants to talk to you. 
D. B. walks up to JOHN. 
D. B. 
Listen to me, my son! Before you lose your head completely, may I remind you that I picked you up out of the gutter and I can throw you right back there again! You've got a nerve accusing people of things! These gentlemen and I know what's the best for the John Does of America, regardless of what tramps like you think! 
Get off that righteous horse of yours and come to your senses. You're the fake! We believe in what we're doing! You're the one that was paid the thirty pieces of silver! Have you forgotten that? Well, I haven't! 
You're a fake, John Doe, and I can prove it! You're the big hero that's supposed to jump off tall buildings and things! Do you remember? What do you suppose your precious John Does will say when they find out that you never had any intention of doing it? That you were being paid to say so? You're lucky if they don't run you out of the country! 
Why, with the newspapers and the radio stations that these gentlemen control, we can kill the John Doe movement deader than a doornail, and we'll do it, too, the moment you step out of line! Now, if you still want to go to that convention and shoot your trap off, you go ahead and do it! 
Full shot: D. B. leaves JOHN and returns to his chair. JOHN stares at him, unbelievingly. 
Close shot: of JOHN. 
JOHN 
(after a pause) 
Do you mean to tell me you'd try to kill the John Doe movement if you can't use it to get what you want? 
D. B.'S VOICE 
You bet your bottom dollar we would! 
JOHN 
(cynically) 
Well, that certainly is a new low. I guess I've seen everything now. 
Wider shot: As JOHN's lips curl up contemptuously and he steps up to the table. 
JOHN 
(throwing his hat on the table) 
You sit there back of your big cigars and think of deliberately killing an idea that's made millions of people a little bit happier! An idea that's brought thousands of them here from all over the country, by bus and by freight, in jallopies and on footso they could pass on to each other their own simple little experiences. 
Close-up: Of ANN. Her eyes light up happily. 
JOHN'S VOICE 
Why, look, I'm just a mug and I know it. But I'm beginning to understand a lot of things. Why, your type's old as history. If you can't lay your dirty fingers on a decent idea and twist it and squeeze it and stuff it into your own pocket, you slap it down! Like dogs, if you can't eat something, you bury it! 
Close-up: Of JOHN. His voice is pleading. 
JOHN 
Why, this is the one worthwhile thing that's come along. People are finally finding out that the guy next door isn't a bad egg. That's simple, isn't it? And yet a thing like that's got a chance of spreading till it touches every last doggone human being in the worldand you talk about killing it! 
Full shot: They listen to himunmoved. 
JOHN 
Why, when this fire dies down, what's going to be left? More misery, more hunger and more hate. And what's to prevent that from starting all over again? Nobody knows the answer to that one, and certainly not you, with those slimy, bolloxed-up theories you've got! The John Doe idea may be the answer, though! It may be the one thing capable of saving this cockeyed world! Yet you sit back there on your fat hulks and tell me you'll kill it if you can't use it! 
Well, you go ahead and try! You couldn't do it in a million years, with all your radio stations and all your power! Because it's bigger than whether I'm a fake! It's bigger than your ambitions! And it's bigger than all the bracelets and fur coats in the world! 
Wider shot: ANN runs to JOHN. 
ANN 
(sincerely) 
You bet it is, John! 
JOHN starts to exit. 
Med. shot: Shooting toward door. 
JOHN 
(turning to them) 
And that's exactly what I'm going down there to tell those people! 
As JOHN reaches door, TED SHELDON jumps in front of him. 
Close shot: 
TED 
Wait a minute, you ungrateful rat! My Uncle's been too good to 
While he speaks, JOHN looks down at the fist clutching his shirt, and then, with a suddenness that startles TED, he steps aside and clips TED on the jaw. TED's knees buckle and he goes down. JOHN exits. 
Wider shot: As several men rush to TED's assistance. D. B. does not move. 
MAN 
He's getting away! 
ANN 
John! 
Ext. entrance to D. B.'s house: Med. shot: As JOHN hurries out. He goes by half a dozen members of TED SHELDON's motorcycle troops who wait around to escort D. B. to the convention. 
Int. Dining room: Full shot: The room is full of commotion. ANN is running out of the room, going after JOHN. Several men bend over TED. D. B. glares toward door, his face hardening. HAMMETT is barking at him. 
D. B. reaches under the table, lifts up two phones. Hands one to HAMMETT. 
D. B. 
Get the Bulletin ! 
He, himself, dials the other phone. 
ANN 
John! 
BARRINGTON 
I've always told you, D. B. you're playing with dynamite! 
D. B. 
(calling to men) 
Don't let that girl get away! 
The butler rushes out. 
WESTON 
Listen . . . John Does . . . 
(weakly) 
You're the hope of the world . . . 
As if in challenge to that statement, the tomato flies in and strikes him on the forehead. It seems to stun him. He remains motionless, staring before him with sightless eyes. The red smear of the tomato trickles down his face. 
Med. shot: Of the COLONEL, amidst the crowd. He sees JOHN hit and winces. Then, setting his jaw, he pushes people violently aside, trying to reach JOHN. 
Med. shot: On platform, JOHN stares futilely before him. The COLONEL reaches his side and glancing sympathetically up at his face, starts to lead him off the platform. A squadron of policemen also rush to his rescue and precede JOHN and the COLONEL. 
Trucking shot: Down the aisleas police disperse the crowd who boo and threaten JOHN from the sidelines. 
Close shot: Of JOHN. He is oblivious of the jeering, shouting moband of the wet newspapers flung in his direction. 
Med. shot: At dug-out exitas the police finally manage to get him safely out of the park. 
Med. shot: ANNOUNCER's booth. 
JOHN B. HUGHES 
The police finally manage to get him out of the park! If that boy isn't hurt, it'll be a miracle! 
Int.: Police station. Med. shot: ANN and her mother sit on a bench. A policeman is in the background. ANN stares into space. Her mother has an arm around her. 
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE 
Ladies and gentlemen, this certainly looks like the end of the John Doe movement. 
A policeman snaps the radio off. 
CONNELL 
(lifts glass of milk) 
Well, boys, you can chalk up another one to the Pontius Pilates. 
Two shot: ANN and her mother. 
ANN 
(sobbing) 
I should have been there. I could have helped him. 
(desolately) 
He was so all alone! 
Her MOTHER draws ANN consolingly to her, and lays her head on her breast. 
Dissolve to: 
Ext.: A highway. Med. shot: Of BERT's car on the way home. 
Int.: Car. Close shot: BERT and SOURPUSS. They both look depressed. After a silence, SOURPUSS speaks. 
SOURPUSS 
(throatily) 
A lot of us are going to be mighty ashamed of ourselves after tonight. We certainly didn't give that man much of a chance. 
They lapse again into silence. BERT stares grimly at the road. 
Dissolve to: Ext.: Clearing under the bridge. Close-up: Of JOHN. He sits on a rock, his head bent low, tears streaming shamelessly down his cheeks. Camera draws back and we find the COLONEL before the fire, boiling water in a small tin pan. 
COLONEL'S VOICE 
Have some more coffee, Long John? 
JOHN 
No, thanks, Colonel. 
JOHN lifts his eyes skyward, stares profoundly, a curious expression over his face. 
Dissolve to: A Montage. Long shot: Of JOHN, a lonely figure, walking dejectedly. As he walks, faces begin to appear one by one, to taunt him. Their accusing voices are heard. 
WOMAN'S VOICE 
Faker! 
MAN'S VOICE 
Racketeer! 
2ND VOICE 
Liar! 
3RD VOICE 
Cheat! 
4TH VOICE 
Imposter! 
5TH VOICE 
Why don't you jump! 
GIRL'S VOICE 
Christmas Eve at midnight! 
(she laughs, sneeringly) 
Dissolve to: Another shot: Of JOHN walking, his expression immobile. Over the shot appear several scenes through which JOHN has lived: 
1. BERT shaking hands with him, saying: 
BERT 
You're a wonderful man, Mr. Doe. 
2. MRS. DELANEY kissing his hand and saying: 
MRS. DELANEY 
May God bless you, my boy. 
3. ANN in Broadcasting Station, kissing him: 
ANN 
Now, get in there and pitch! 
4. D. B. issuing his tirade at JOHN: 
D. B. 
You're a fake, John Doe, and I can prove it! You're the big hero that's supposed to jump off tall buildings and things. You remember? What do you suppose your precious John Does will say when they find out that you never had any intention of doing itthat you were being paid to say so? 
5. Again the girl who laughed appears: 
GIRL 
Christmas Eve at midnight? 
And again she laughs sneeringly. 
Dissolve to: Ext.: City Hall towernight. Long shot: It is a picturesque scene of the City Hall outlined in silhouette against the sky. A peaceful mantle of snow silently descends upon it. Over the shot we hear the plaintive voices of children singing "Holy Night." 
Dissolve to: Ext.: Outside of D. B.'s house: Med. shot: Outside D. B.'s Studythrough window. A group of eight young carolers sing "Holy Night." It is a continuation of the music from previous scene. 
Cut to: Int. D. B.'s study. Med. shot: In the dimly lit room, we see the lonely figure of D. B., as he stands near a window staring out, meditatively. The voices of the children singing Christmas carols are faintly heard. 
Close-up: Of D. B. He peers into the night, enveloped by disturbing thoughts. After a moment, he takes out his watch and glances at it. Then, as if annoyed by his own apprehension, he shoves it violently back into his pocket. 
Camera retreats in front of him as he crosses, determinedly, to a humidor, takes a cigar and shoves it into his mouth. Just as he is about to light it, he becomes aware of the signing, and cocks his head, listening. 
Wider shot: As he drops the match and the unlighted cigarand starts toward door. Just then the BUTLER comes through. 
BUTLER 
Merry Christmas, sir. 
D. B. 
Oh. Merry Christmas. 
D. B. hands him a bill and nods toward the children. The BUTLER exits. 
Close-up: Of D. B. Staring out into space moodily. We hear the voices of the children saying, "Thank you, sir! Merry Christmas!" D. B.'s mouth screws up, unhappily. It is far from a "merry" Christmas. It is a very lonely, conscience-stricken one. 
Dissolve to: Int.: Police station. Med. shot: A SERGEANT sits in front of his desk. Opposite him is a POLICEMAN. Their rummy game has been interrupted by a phone call which the SERGEANT is now answering. 
SERGEANT 
Who? John Doe? Is that screwball still around? 
(laughing) 
This is as far as the elevator goes. We've got to walk up to the tower. 
He indicates the stairway. 
Cut to: Wider shot: As they cross to stairway, silently. 
Dissolve to: Ext.: City Hall roof. Full shot: The men enter. They glance around searchinglyand then slowly move toward the edge of the parapet. 
Closer shot: The men look obviously self-conscious. No one speaks for a while. 
BENNETT 
(breaking the silence) 
That tramp is probably full of Christmas cheer and asleep in some flop house. 
There is again silence. After a few minutes, the MAYOR speaks. 
MAYOR 
Let's go. I've got to decorate my tree. 
Cut to: Int.: Corridor14th floor. Med. shot: Outside Men's Washroom. JOHN comes out, and as camera pans with him he proceeds to letter chute next to elevator. We see that it is the top of the chute, and from the elevator being there, we know it is the 14th floor. JOHN drops the letter into the chute. 
Ext.: City Hall roof. Full shot: The place is silent except for occasional scraping of feet as several of the men move around. They continually refer to their watches. Finally, D. B. gives up impatiently. 
D. B. 
Well, I give up. I don't know what gave us the idea that hehe'd attempt anything like this. 
WESTON 
I guess you're right. I'm afraid the joke's on us. Let's go. 
D. B. 
I hope nobody finds out we've been here. 
They all start to exit, when suddenly D. B. stops. He puts his hand out, and they all stop to listen. They hear footsteps, and back into the shadows. 
Med. shot: Shooting toward stairs. JOHN appears around the bend and mounts the last few steps. 
Med. shot: Of the huddled group. They watch breathlessly. In the darkness, their eyes dominate the scene. 
Med. shot: Over their shoulders. As JOHN, expressionless, his cigarette in his hand, crosses to the parapet, and looks out. He takes a puff of his cigarette and exhales the smoke. 
Med. shot: Of the huddled group. The MAYOR is for stepping forward, but D. B. with an extended hand stops him, indicating for them to wait and see what happens. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He takes the envelope out of his pocket and examines it. 
Close shot: Of the group. Their eyes glued on him tensely. 
Close shot: Of JOHN. He stares at the envelope. 
Insert: Of envelope. On it is written: "TO JOHN DOES EVERYWHERE". 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He replaces the envelope in his pocket. 
Int.: Tower. Close shot: The group. Their eyes riveted on JOHN. They feel the moment has come. Several of them glance toward D. B. 
Wider shot: To include them all, and JOHN. He drops his cigarette on the ground, and bending over, crushes it with his foot. Just as he straightens out again, D. B. speaks. 
D. B. 
(restrained voice) 
I wouldn't do that if I were you, John. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. As he turns sharply, startled. He stares blankly at the five people. 
Med. shot: Of the group. They move slightly forward and stop. 
D. B. 
It'll do you no good. 
Close-up: Of JOHN. He continues to stare at them, strangely. 
Wider shot: To include them all. 
D. B. 
The Mayor has policemen downstairs with instructions to remove all marks of identification you may have on your person. You'll be buried in Potter's Field[12] and you will have accomplished nothing. 
Close shot: Of JOHN. After a moment, he speaks. 
JOHN 
(in a sepulchral voice) 
I've taken care of that. I've already mailed a copy of this letter to Mr. Connell. 
Med. shot: Of the group. Amazed that he thought of this. They feel themselves helpless. D. B. tries taking an authoritative tone. 
D. B. 
(his throat is dry) 
John, why don't you forget this foolishness? 
He steps forward as he speaks. 
JOHN 
(quicklythreateningly) 
Stop right where you are, Mr. Norton, if you don't want to go overboard with me. 
Close-up: Of JOHN's face. His eyes have a wild, maniacal look in them. 
Close-up: Of D. B. He stares into JOHN's eyes and a terrified expression covers his face. 
Wider shot: As D. B. instinctively backs up. 
JOHN 
(throatily) 
I'm glad you gentlemen are here. You've killed the John Doe movement, all right, but you're going to see it born all over again. Now, take a good look, Mr. Norton. 
Int.: Landing to tower. Med. shot: As ANN practically has to pull herself up to the last step. Her face is wet from fever and exhaustion. 
ANN 
(an outcry) 
John! 
Int.: Tower. Full shot: As everyone, startled by the outcry, turns. ANN staggers into scene. 
ANN 
(crying) 
John! 
She rushes and throws her arms around him. 
ANN 
(muffled sobs) 
Oh, John, darling. No! No! 
Close shot: JOHN and ANN. He stares down at her, blankly. ANN clutches him, her head buried in his shoulder. 
ANN 
(muffled sobs) 
I won't let you. I love you, darling. 
Med. shot: Of the group. They remain motionless, watching. 
Close shot: JOHN and ANN. She emits wracking sobs, then lifts her eyes up to him. 
ANN 
(in a desperate plea) 
John. Please, John, listen to me. We'll start all over again, just you and I. It isn't too late. The John Doe movement isn't dead yet. 
Suddenly she becomes conscious of the others present, and she turns her head. 
Camera pans over to what she sees. The group of men watching, silently. 
Camera pans back to ANN. Her eyes widen slowly. She looks from them to JOHN and back again, and her face takes on an excited, breathless look, as the reason for their being there becomes comprehensible to her. 
ANN 
(excitedly) 
See, John! It isn't dead, or they wouldn't be here! It's alive in them . They kept it alive. By being afraid of it. That's why they came up here. 
Close shot: ANN and JOHN. He continues to stand with his hands at his sides, looking at her, while she clings to him desperately. While she speaks, he turns his face from her and stares at the men.

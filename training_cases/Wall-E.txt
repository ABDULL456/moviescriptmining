WALL-E 
Written by 
Andrew Stanton & Pete Docter 
EXT. SPACE 
FADE IN: 
Stars. The upbeat show tune, Put On Your Sunday Clothes, plays. 
"Out there, there's a world outside of Yonkers..." 
More stars. Distant galaxies, constellations, nebulas... A single planet. Drab and brown. Moving towards it. Pushing through its polluted atmosphere. 
"...Close your eyes and see it glisten..." 
EXT. PLANET'S SURFACE - CONTINUOUS 
A range of mountains takes form in the haze. Moving closer. The mountains are piles of TRASH. The entire surface is nothing but waste. 
"...We're gonna find adventure in the evening air..." 
A silhouetted city in the distance. What looks like skyscrapers turns into trash. Thousands of neatly stacked CUBES OF TRASH, stories high. Rows and rows of stacked cubes, like city avenues. They go on for miles. 
EXT. AVENUE OF TRASH 
"...Beneath your parasol the world is all a smile..." 
Something moving on the ground far below. A figure at the foot of a trash heap. A SMALL SERVICE ROBOT diligently cubing trash. Rusted, ancient. Cute. Every inch of him engineered for trash compacting. 
Mini-shovel hands collect junk. Scoop it into his open chassis. His front plate closes slowly, compressing waste. A faded label on his corroded chest plate: "Waste Allocation Loader - Earth Class" (WALL-E) 
Wall-E spits out a cube of trash. Stacks it with the others. 
Something catches his eye. Tugs on a piece of metal stuck in the stack. A hubcap. The sun reflects off it. Wall-E checks the sky. 
ON TRASH HEAP HORIZON 
The sun sets through the smoggy haze. 
"...And we won't come back until we've kissed a girl --" 
He places the hubcap in his compactor. Presses a button on his chest. The song stops playing. The end of a work day. 
Wall-E attaches a lunch cooler to his back. Whistles for his pet COCKROACH. The insect hops on his shoulder. They motor down from the top of a GIANT TRASH TOWER. 
EXT. AVENUES OF TRASH - DUSK 
Wall-E travels alone. Traverses miles of desolate waste. Oblivious to roving storms of toxic weather. 
Passes haunting structures buried within the trash. Buildings, highways, entire cities... Everything branded with the SAME COMPANY LOGO. "Buy N Large" "BNL" stores, restaurants, banks...transportation! The corporation ran every aspect of life. There's even a BNL LOGO on Wall-E's chest plate. 
CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER Wall-E drives over. Headline: "TOO MUCH TRASH!! Earth Covered!!" The deck: "BNL CEO Declares Global Emergency!" A photo of the BNL CEO giving a weak smile. 
Wall-E's old treads are threadbare. Practically falling apart. Cause a bumpy ride for his cockroach. He passes the remains of other RUSTED WALL-E UNITS. Fancies one with NEWER TREADS than his own... 
EXT. DESERTED STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
Wall-E now sports the newer treads. Rolls past a SERIES OF HOLOGRAPHIC BILLBOARDS. The solar-powered ads still activate when he passes them. 
BILLBOARD ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (Ad #1: BNL logo over trash) Too much garbage in your face? (Ad #2: starliner in space) There's plenty of space out in space! (Ad #3: starliners take off from Earth) BNL starliners leaving each day. (Ad #4: WALL-E units wave goodbye) We'll clean up the mess while you're away. 
EXT. EDGE OF THE CITY 
The morning sun. Wall-E fully exposed in its light. His front panel splayed out like a tanning shield. A solar collector. 
His CHARGE METER chimes full. Solar panels fold away into hiding. Wall-E, now awake, collects his lunch cooler. Heads off to work. ...and accidentally runs over the cockroach. Horrified, Wall-E reverses. 
Reveals the FLATTENED INSECT under his tread. The cockroach simply pops back to life. No biggie. Ready to go. Relieved, Wall-E resumes their commute. 
EXT. WALL-E'S WORK SITE - THAT MORNING 
A SERIES OF "WALL-E AT WORK" MOMENTS: 
- CU of Wall-E's hands digging into garbage. CU of trash being scooped into his chest compactor. A cube lands by the cockroach. 
- Wall-E discovers a BRA in the garbage. Unsure what it's for. Tries placing it over his eyes, like glasses. Tosses it in his cooler. 
- Wall-E finds a set of CAR KEYS. Presses the remote lock. Somewhere in the distance a CAR ALARM CHIRPS. 
- Plays with a paddle ball. The ball keeps smacking him in the face. He doesn't like it. 
- Wall-E discovers a DIAMOND RING in a JEWEL CASE. Throws out the ring. Keeps the case. The jewel case drops into the cooler, then... ...A RUBBER DUCKY... ...A BOBBLE HEAD DOLL... ...An OLD BOOT... ...A TROPHY... 
- Wall-E finds a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Activates it. FOAM blasts in his face. It's tossed far, far away from his cooler. 
- Wall-E's shovel hand strikes something solid. Faces a REFRIGERATOR much larger than himself. Now what? 
- CU on fridge door. A WELDING BEAM moves down its center. It emits from between Wall-E's SPLIT BINOCULAR EYES. 
The door falls apart in two pieces. Reveals... 
...a SMALL PLANT 
in its early stage of growth. Wall-E is entranced. Carefully, he extracts the section of earth around it. 
CLOSE ON IGLOO COOLER 
Wall-E gently places the plant inside the old boot. Dusts dirt off the leaves. 
EXT. TRUCK - DUSK 
Robot and faithful cockroach return home. Wall-E stops short of the threshold. Stares at the ground. Continues staring. 
A RED DOT 
quivers on the dirt. A single laser point of light. Wall-E moves to touch it... 
...The dot races along the ground. 
Wall-E drops his Igloo. Chases after the dot. 
EXT. EMPTY BAY 
The dot leads Wall-E deep into the polluted expanse. He is so fixated on it he doesn't notice 
MANY LASER POINTS 
coming from every direction. All racing into the valley over the contour of the terrain. Triangulating towards a center. 
Wall-E's dot suddenly stops. Slowly he reaches for it. Can't grab it. Just light. ALL THE DOTS converge in front of him. The ground shakes. Wall-E becomes confused. 
Doesn't see above him. The SUN growing brighter behind the cloud cover. A noise. Building. 
Rocket engines. Wall-E senses he should look to the sky. 
Now THREE SUNS are descending on him. 
Wall-E runs for it. An enormous COLUMN OF FIRE blocks his path. A second column of fire. A third. Trapped. 
...A HAND. 
She lets the insect crawl up her arm. Wiggles into her workings. It tickles. 
EVE [Giggles] 
Wall-E relaxes. CHUCKLES privately. 
Eve sonically picks up Wall-E's location. Locks onto him. 
Arm converts to laser cannon. Fires rapidly. Quick glimpses of Wall-E dodging the blasts. Trash piles are systematically obliterated around him. 
Wall-E now exposed. Nowhere to hide. Boxes himself up. Shakes uncontrollably. Eve holds her fire. 
EVE (electronic hums) [Identify yourself.] 
She slowly approaches Wall-E's box. Keeps her gun trained on him. 
EVE (electronic hums) [Repeat. Identify yourself.] 
Wall-E peeks out from his box. Doesn't understand a thing she says. Doesn't care. Can't believe she's real. The cockroach climbs down her gun arm. Jumps onto his master. 
Eve scans Wall-E. A RED LIGHT appears on her chest. Buzzes "negative". He's not what she's looking for. She retracts her gun arm. Hovers off. Wall-E watches her go. Lovestruck. 
WALL-E [Sigh.] 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ABANDONED BNL SUPERSTORE - NEXT DAY 
LOUIS ARMSTRONG'S "LA VIE EN ROSE" PLAYS 
Eve scans through the market. Wall-E follows from a safe distance. A stray puppy-dog. 
Eve glances over at him. Wall-E panics. Bumps into a RACK OF SHOPPING CARTS. Creates an avalanche. 
They chase him down a flight of stairs. Wall-E reaches the exit doors. Won't open! Carts pig pile on top of him. 
EXT. BNL REFINERY - NIGHT 
Wall-E perched on the roof. Patiently watches Eve fly. She scans the ground below her, like a searchlight. 
Eve comes in for a landing below. Shuts down for the night. Wall-E waits. Quietly sneaks down the refinery fire escape. Accidentally trips. Tumbles to the ground. Eve doesn't wake. Wall-E creeps up to her. Opens his arms wide... ...and measures her. Turns to a pile of trash. Splits open his eyes. Begins welding something... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BNL REFINERY - NEXT MORNING 
Eve powers up again. Does a double take. A TRASH SCULPTURE OF EVE stands in front of her. She hovers away, unimpressed. Doesn't notice Wall-E hiding behind a PILE OF PIPES. Wall-E kicks the pipes in frustration. They roll on top of him. 
SONG ENDS 
MONTAGE OF EVE SEARCHING 
- Scans a car engine. Negative. Slams the hood shut. 
- Scans a Port-A-Potty. Negative. Slams the door shut. 
- Scans an Apollo capsule. Negative. Slams the hatch shut. 
- Scans a FREIGHTER HOLD. 
Negative. Slams the lid shut. 
EXT. DERELICT SHIPYARD - DUSK 
EVE (hums) [Hey watch it! Don't come any closer!] 
She draws her gun on him. Doesn't understand the danger. The sandstorm rushes up behind her. Too late. Wall-E collapses into a box. The storm hits full force. Eve is instantly lost, disoriented. 
EVE Wall-E? Wall-E? 
WALL-E'S HAND appears out of the dust. Calmly takes Eve's hand. 
INT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER 
The back door lowers. A rush of wind and sand. Wall-E pulls Eve inside. Closes the door. She coughs up dust. 
Wall-E hits a switch... Strings of CHRISTMAS LIGHTS fill the space. His racks of oddities painted in colored light. 
An air of enchantment. Eve is taken aback. 
WALL-E (beeps) [Come on in.] 
She drifts through the sea of knickknacks. Becomes spooked by a SINGING BILLY BASS FISH. Threatens to shoot it, but Wall-E calms her down. He is compelled to show her everything. Hands her an eggbeater... ...bubble wrap (so infectious to pop)... ...a lightbulb (lights when she holds it)... ...the Rubik's Cube (she solves it immediately)... ...his Hello Dolly tape. Curious, she begins unspooling the tape. 
WALL-E (loud beeps) [My tape!!] 
He grabs it back. Protective. Inserts it carefully into the VCR. Please still work. The movie eventually appears on the TV. Plays a clip of POYSC. Wall-E is relieved. 
WALL-E (beeps) [What do you think?] 
Mimics the dancing for Eve. Encourages her to try. She clumsily hops up and down. Makes dents in the floor. Rattles everything. Wall-E politely stops her. 
WALL-E (beeps) [How `bout we try a different move?] 
Spins in a circle. Arms out. Eve copies. Spins faster, and faster... Too fast. Accidentally strikes Wall-E. He flies into the shelves. 
Eve helps him up from the mess. Wall-E's LEFT BINOCULAR EYE falls off. Dangles from two wires. Eve GASPS with concern. Wall-E placates her. 
WALL-E (beeps) [It's fine.] 
Feels his way to the rack of shelves. Rotates them until... ...SPARE WALL-E PARTS appear. Replaces his broken eye with a new one. Eve is relieved. 
She eyes his LIGHTER COLLECTION. Flicks open a Zippo. Ignites a FLAME. Wall-E freezes. He had no idea it could do that. Moves closer to inspect it... 
ON WALL-E 
It's the closest he's ever been to Eve. She remains focused on the lighter. Wall-E stares up at her. ...The tiny flame flickering between them... ...The Hello Dolly video plays IOTAM in the background... Suddenly, he is moved to express his love. Musters the courage to open his fingers... ...Timidly reaches his hand out to hers... 
-- Eve turns and looks at him. 
Wall-E instantly chokes. Pulls his hand back. Eve becomes intrigued with the TV. Scans the image of the lovers singing IOTAM... Wall-E watches her. His infatuation still palpable. Then he remembers... 
WALL-E Ee-vah! 
He rushes to his shelves. Eve watches him rummage through junk. A drum falls down on his head. She giggles, charmed by it all. Something about Wall-E... 
She is drawn back to the lovers on TV... ...then the lit Zippo lighter in her hand. A tap on her shoulder. She turns to find Wall-E holding something. 
The plant. 
Eve immediately locks onto it. 
Drops the lighter. In a flash... ...her chest opens... ...a TRACTOR BEAM snatches the plant away... ...stores it inside her... Then she shuts down completely. Only a SINGLE GREEN LIGHT pulsing on her chest. 
Wall-E is stunned. What'd I do? Waves his hand in front of her face. 
WALL-E Ee-vah? 
Knocks on her chest plate. No response. Wall-E panics. Gently shakes her. 
BASE OF RECON SHIP 
The engines blast a WALL OF SMOKE. Preparation for launch... 
INT. RECON SHIP 
Eve is secured into a slot. Joins a ROW OF OTHER EVE PROBES. All dormant. Only Eve flashes a GREEN LIGHT. The CAMERA DRIFTS BACK out a window... 
OUTSIDE THE SHIP 
...where Wall-E steadily climbs up the side. The ship's engines ignite. Wall-E clamps his hands tight to a metal support. The rocket takes off into space. 
EXT. TOP OF HILL 
The cockroach watches his master go. 
EXT. RECON SHIP 
The spaceship roars through the sky. Wall-E tightens his grip, battling the G's. He looks ahead. SCREAMS. 
HUNDREDS OF BNL SATELLITES 
litter the outer atmosphere. The ship bursts through the layer. 
EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS 
The recon ship breaks free of the planet. Its boosters shut down. Wall-E takes in the sudden QUIETNESS OF SPACE. Looks back at his planet. 
WALL-E Oooh... 
Weightlessness takes effect. Wall-E almost floats away. Grabs hold of the ship. Knocks on a WINDOW near Eve. 
WALL-E E-vah! 
No response. She remains shut down. Wall-E points out at the stars. It is the most spectacular light show possible. And Wall-E has a front row seat. 
MONTAGE OF CELESTIAL SPECTACLES 
- The ship flies past the MOON. A BILLBOARD stands next to the abandoned APOLLO MOON ROVER. "BNL Outlet Coming Soon." 
- The ship passes by the SUN. Wall-E pops open his solar panels. 
Instantly recharges. 
- The ship cruises alongside SATURN'S OUTER RINGS. Wall-E runs his hand through the tiny particles of ice. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. RECON SHIP - DAYS LATER 
A DUMBBELL NEBULA slowly twists in space. Wall-E is mesmerized by it. Leads his eye to a LIGHT, growing in the distance ahead. A planet? No. A starliner. Gigantic in size. 
The "AXIOM". 
The now tiny recon ship heads straight for it. 
INT. DOCKING BAY 
TWO TUG-ROCKETS guide the ship in. It locks into GIANT BRACES fixed on the deck. The impact knocks Wall-E off. He lands in the scaffolding of the front brace. 
Suddenly the entire dock comes to life. Robotic arms and service robots of all types appear. ...Rise from the floor... ..Lower from the ceiling... It's a cacophony of automation. They all attend to the ship. 
EVE 
and four other probes slide out of the ship's side. Suspended in a horizontal rack. Wall-E is surprised to find her facing him. She remains shut down. Just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them. 
ON M-O'S DISPLAY 
Reads: "FOREIGN CONTAMINANT" 
The tracks lead to the elevator. M-O's neurosis takes over. Must clean dirt. He makes a radical decision and... ...jumps off his line. Starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail. 
INT. ELEVATOR 
Gopher waits patiently as the floors pass. Wall-E hidden behind the transport. Peeks at Eve. Pets her blank faceplate. 
WALL-E (quiet beeps) [It'll be okay, Eve.] 
The ELEVATOR DOORS suddenly open. 
INT. ROBOT SERVICE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS 
DOZENS OF ROBOTS speed along a multi-lane passageway. All following glowing lines on the floor. Wall-E's head whipsaws back and forth. Tries to process it all. Doesn't notice Gopher's transport merge into traffic... ...without him! 
Wall-E shrinks from the high-speed traffic. Timidly attempts to merge. Sticks out one tread... -- Instantly causes a ROBOT PILE-UP. Wall-E boxes up. Guns it. Weaves across all the lines on the floor. Bounces off robots like bumper cars. 
Barely able to navigate the chaos. Takes refuge in the middle of an INTERSECTION. Scans for Eve... 
ON WALL-E'S POV DISPLAY 
...a PAINT-BOT paints a wall sign... ...A GARBAGE-BOT dumps trash into a wall chute... ...Down the hall, Eve's transport glides up a ramp... 
WALL-E EE-VAH! 
Wall-E chases after them. 
INT. UPPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Wall-E flies up the ramp. Nearly collides with a merging HOVER CHAIR. It blocks his way. Wall-E gains alongside it, and discovers 
A HUMAN PASSENGER 
sitting, reclined, in the chair. He is large, round and soft - like a big baby. Wears a red, BNL jumpsuit. The chair seems to be steering itself. Guided by floor lines, just like the robots. Speaker headrests block his peripheral vision. A HOLOGRAPHIC SCREEN floats inches in front of his face. He converses with a SECOND PASSENGER on screen: 
PASSENGER #1 Well, I've been in my cabin all morning so let's hover over to the driving range and hit a few virtual balls into space. 
PASSENGER #2 (ON SCREEN) Nah, we did that yesterday. I don't want to do that. 
PASSENGER #1 Well then what do you want to do? 
ON WALL-E 
He looks over his shoulder. Passenger #2 is floating right next to them. Isolated in his own hover chair. Also in a red jumpsuit. Also a big baby. 
PASSENGER #2 I don't know. Something. 
Both humans are totally unaware of the other's presence. They all exit the hallway. Merge into the... 
ECONOMY CLASS COURTYARD 
Wall-E is in awe. Hundreds of floors of GUEST ROOMS rise on all sides. THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS fill the giant space. All reclined and riding on hover chairs. MULTIPLE FLOOR LINES guide their chairs in all directions. 
Humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes. Absolutely no reason to ever get up. No purpose. Every one of them engrossed in their video screens. Cocooned in virtual worlds. Over-developed fingers tap ARMREST KEYPADS. The controls allow them to steer... ...order food... ...play games... ...and most of all... 
...CHAT MINDLESSLY with other passengers: 
The CHATTER is deafening. No one notices Wall-E at all. He drives into the endless human traffic. 
MISC. FEMALE PASSENGER Bot, over here! 
A DRINK-BOT floats over to a passenger. Puts a fresh drink in her open hand. Wall-E flows with the traffic into a LARGE TUNNEL. 
AUTOPILOT Sir -- 
CAPTAIN Coffee. 
Wall-E hides under the console just in time. 
The Captain reaches for his coffee. Makes a minimal effort. Easier to adjust his chairback slowly forward... ...almost there...and...he grabs the coffee. 
AUTOPILOT Sir, the annual -- 
The Captain gives Auto the hand. Sips his coffee. 
CAPTAIN Protocol, Auto. First things first. (to the room) Computer, status report. 
His chair automatically arcs along the console. SPECIFIC PANELS light up as he passes. 
CAPTAIN                       SHIP'S COMPUTER (sips coffee)                   Unchanged...unchanged... Mechanical systems?...Reactor      unchanged...unchanged... core temperature?...Passenger      unchanged...unchanged... count?...Regenerative food         unchanged... buffet?...Jacuzzi Ph balance... Atmospheric conditions...laundry service volume... 
ON WALL-E 
He eyes Eve on the transport across the room. Has to get to her. But Auto is right above him. Can't move. 
AUTOPILOT Captain... 
Auto calls up a screen on the console. Displays the recon-ship and a flashing positive probe. Waits patiently for the Captain to notice. Finally, the Captain turns... 
CAPTAIN Okay, Auto. 
AUTOPILOT Sir, the annual reconnaissance has -- 
...but then notices the time. 
CAPTAIN (disappointed sigh) Auto, why didn't you wake me for the morning announcements? 
He slingshots his chair to the Lido Deck side of the bridge. Wall-E nearly collides with him. 
Ducks back under the console. 
CAPTAIN Honestly, it's the one thing I get to do on this ship. 
Grabs a large dial. TIME OF DAY ICONS surround it. Cranks it from mid-day back to sunrise. 
OUT ON LIDO DECK 
- The FAKE NOON SUN reverses at high speed to a SUNRISE. - Passengers' LUNCH CUPS switch to BREAKFAST CUPS. - Poolside passengers' umbrella-bots close up. 
An ANNOUNCEMENT WHISTLE BLOWS over the intercom. A SECTION OF SKY DOME becomes a JUMBOTRON SCREEN. Displays a live video feed of the Captain. The image also shows up on every passenger's CHAIR SCREEN. 
CAPTAIN (ON INTERCOM) (unmotivated) Well, good morning everybody, and welcome to day 255,642 aboard the Axiom. As always, weather's a balmy 72 degrees and sunny, and -- Oh, hey, I see the ship's log is showing that today is our 700th anniversary of our five year cruise. Well, I'm sure our forefathers would be proud to know that 700 years later we'd be... (deflates) ...doing the exact same thing...they were doing... 
Cut to VARIOUS ASPECTS OF AXIOM LIVING. The listening passengers look just as bored as the Captain. 
CAPTAIN (INTERCOM) (snaps out of ennui) SO! Be sure next mealtime to ask for your free... (hard to pronounce) ...septuacentennial cupcake -- in a cup. Also today we have, uh...uh...Hey, Auto, what's that flashing button? (mic feedback whine) 
BACK ON THE BRIDGE 
The Captain stares at a FLASHING BUTTON on the console. It bears the same PLANT ICON as Eve's display. 
AUTOPILOT (O.S.) Captain? 
The Captain turns to Auto. For the first time he notices Eve. Finally. Auto hovers over her. Salutes. 
AUTOPILOT Probe One has returned positive. 
CAPTAIN Positive? 
EVE (hushed; angry) [Wall-E, what are you doing here?! You can't be here! You're going to get me in trouble!...] 
Makes a flurry of clandestine gestures at him. Wall-E just stares at her. Smitten. 
WALL-E (swoons) Ee-vah... 
ON THE CAPTAIN 
He manages to turn to the FIRST PAGE OF INSTRUCTIONS. 
CAPTAIN (reads aloud) Well, let's open her up. Step One. Voice command, "Confirm Acquisition." 
SHIP'S COMPUTER Confirm Acquisition. 
The bridge suddenly jumps to life. Green lights flash. A LARGE DEVICE appears from the ceiling... ...Scans the entire room... ...Identifies Eve... ...Rides along the ceiling rails... ...Stations itself directly above Eve... ...Arms unfold. Position her... ...A VOICE ARM swings into the Captain's face: 
SHIP'S COMPUTER Voice authorization required. 
CAPTAIN ...Uh... 
SHIP'S COMPUTER Accepted. 
A BUTTON-PUSHING ARM lowers. Presses a sequence of buttons on Eve... Her chest lights up. The doors open. The Captain winces... 
...and nothing is inside. 
CAPTAIN Where's the thingie? 
AUTOPILOT Plant. 
CAPTAIN Plant. Right. Right. Where is it? (checks manual) Maybe we missed a step. Show me how you change the text again... 
Auto and the Captain turn away. Re-read the manual. Eve is stunned. Searches her chest cavity for the plant. Then she remembers... 
EVE Plant! Wall-E... (turns on him) Wall-E! 
Wall-E flinches. Surprised by her anger. Eve opens Wall-E's chest. Empty. Picks him up. Scans the floor. Nothing. 
WALL-E Ee-vah? 
EVE (angry electronics) [Find it!] PLANT! 
Wall-E scared of her. Starts searching. 
CAPTAIN (O.S.) Why don't you scan her to be sure. 
Eve jumps back to attention. Auto slides up to her. Scans her chest cavity. 
AUTOPILOT Contains no specimen. Probe's memory is faulty. 
CAPTAIN So, then...we're NOT going to Earth? 
AUTOPILOT (shakes his wheel) Negative. 
CAPTAIN So, uh, I guess things go back to normal, huh? 
AUTOPILOT Correct, Captain. 
CAPTAIN (privately relieved) Well, false alarm! 
SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) False alarm. 
Instantly the plant retrieval device retracts. Exits back into the ceiling. The shades rise. Lights go back on. 
CAPTAIN The probe must be defective. Gopher, send her to the Repair Ward. 
The orderly-arms now start on Wall-E. He escapes before they can place a defect boot on him. Races through the ward. Wall-E runs smack into a defective BEAUTICIAN-BOT. 
BEAUTICIAN-BOT (pre-recorded) Just a trim? Uh huh. 
She paints Wall-E's face with hideous looking make-up. Holds up a mirror. Wall-E gasps. 
BEAUTICIAN-BOT You look gorgeous. 
Wall-E is snatched up by an orderly-arm. Placed in an empty force field pen. Sits between a PAINT-BOT and VACU-BOT: ...The broken paint-bot flings paint at Wall-E... ...The vacu-bot sneezes dust in his face... Across the way a MASSAGE-BOT flails wildly. Orderly-arms restrain him with an ENERGY STRAIGHTJACKET. 
Eve slides past Wall-E. Carried by an orderly-arm. Brought into the "DIAGNOSTICS" ROOM. The frosted glass doors shut. 
WALL-E Ee-vah! 
INT. DIAGNOSTICS ROOM 
Orderly-arms run diagnostics on a few reject robots: 
- An UMBRELLA-BOT flips open and overextends. The orderly-arms struggle to close it. 
- A DEFIBRILLATOR-BOT shocks a CRASH-TEST-DUMMY. It bursts into flames. 
Eve is awoken from "sleep" mode. A series of tests begin. Eve is annoyed but calm. It's all routine. An orderly-arm easily detaches her gun arm. 
OUT IN THE REPAIR WARD 
Wall-E stares at the frosted glass doors. Can only make out EVE'S SILHOUETTE. To him, her arm is being ripped off. 
WALL-E Ee-vah! 
BACK INSIDE WITH EVE 
The orderly-arm tests Eve's circuitry. Her insides light up. It tickles. 
EVE (Giggles) 
Next to her the UMBRELLA-BOT's mechanism SCREECHES. 
OUTSIDE WITH WALL-E 
Wall-E watches in horror. It looks as if Eve is being tortured. Mistakes the screeching for her screams. Wall-E struggles to free himself. 
INSIDE WITH EVE 
She is washed and scrubbed. A CIRCULAR BUFFER cleans between her head and body. It feels good. 
BACK ON WALL-E 
It looks as if Eve is being beheaded. He needs to stop the torture. Wall-E fires his CUTTING LASER at his pen's force field. The barrier shorts out. Wall-E tumbles to the floor. Lands on his "Play" button. POYSC blares across the ward. The Rejects all stop and stare. 
WALL-E EEEEEEVAAAAHH!! 
Wall-E races to the diagnostics room. Crashes right through the glass doors. Finds Eve surrounded by orderly-arms. Grabs Eve's separated gun arm. Points it at the orderly-arms. 
WALL-E (angry beeps) [Let her go, or I'll shoot!] 
His hands tremble, Don Knotts-style. Doesn't realize... 
...he's holding the gun backwards. 
Eve slowly reaches for the weapon. 
EVE ("Put the gun down...") Wall-E... 
An orderly lunges at him. Wall-E panics. Shoots! The gun fires backwards. It blasts through the repair ward. 
She can see the DOCKING BAY below her. Just under the bay doors... 
...a row of EMERGENCY ESCAPE PODS. 
Eve gets an idea. Grabs Wall-E and flies down the hallway... 
INSIDE AXIOM ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 
Eve and Wall-E ride in uncomfortable silence. Their "WANTED" IMAGE plays on an elevator screen. 
SHIP'S COMPUTER (SCREEN) Caution: Rogue robots. 
Wall-E points to it. 
WALL-E (beeps) [Hey look! We're on TV -- !] 
Eve aims her gun at the screen. Blows it to pieces. Wall-E shrinks into a box. Never mind. 
INT. ESCAPE POD BAY/OVER HALLWAY 
Dark. The elevator chimes. Eve and Wall-E step out. Rows of NUMBERED BAY DOORS line the hallway. Eve approaches "Bay #1". She and Wall-E enter... 
INT. ESCAPE POD BAY #1 - CONTINUOUS 
Eve navigates the dark. Approaches a freestanding CONSOLE. Fiddles with some buttons. 
ON WALL-E 
He glances down at EVE'S HAND. Privately intertwines his fingers. Maybe now is the right moment... 
WALL-E (quiet) Ee-vah...? 
FLASH! Banks of controls light up around them. 
AN ESCAPE POD 
is revealed at the end of the room. Its hatch automatically opens. Bathes the room with light from its lit interior. Eve turns to Wall-E: 
EVE Earth. 
She points to an OVERHEAD SCREEN. It displays coordinates to Earth. 
EVE Earth. 
She gestures for Wall-E to enter the pod. He happily complies. Jumps up on one of the seats. Pats the seat next to him. Aren't you coming? 
Eve remains at the threshold. Shakes her head. Points to her chest. Makes her PLANT SYMBOL glow. 
EVE Directive. 
...She's not going. 
This changes everything. Wall-E races out of the pod. Boxes up. 
WALL-E (beeps) [Then I'm not going either.] 
Eve shakes her head. 
EVE (gentle, but firm) Wall-E. 
Carries his box back into the pod. Exits. Wall-E follows her right back out. Drives behind the console. You can't make me. Eve sighs. 
EVE (frustrated) Wall-E. 
The hallway elevator CHIMES. They both look up. Someone is coming. 
SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) Ten seconds till self-destruct... 
Wall-E panics. Looks for a means of escape. Spots the hatch. Grabs the pod's FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Shoots himself to the door. 
SHIP'S COMPUTER Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... 
Pulls on the EMERGENCY EXIT LEVER. The hatch won't open! 
ON EVE 
She races through space after him. Suddenly, in the distance, the POD EXPLODES. 
Eve is gut-punched. 
EVE No, no, no... 
She flies towards the debris field, when -- 
Wall-E whizzes right past her. 
WALL-E Ee-vaaaaaah! 
He holds the FIRE EXTINGUISHER. Uses it as a form of propulsion. Eve is consumed with relief. Chases after him. 
ON WALL-E 
He points the extinguisher the other way. Attempts to fly back over to her. It's hard to steer... 
...They rocket right past each other again... 
WALL-E (beeps) [Stay there! I'll come to you!] 
Eve waits. Wall-E finally has the hang of steering. Fires short bursts. Very slowly...makes his way...to Eve. Gets extinguisher foam in her face. She giggles. 
WALL-E ("Look what I've got") Ee-vah... 
He opens his compactor door. Pulls out the PLANT, still in the boot. 
EVE (Gasp!) 
ON EVE'S DISPLAY POV 
...Sensors zero in on the plant... ...Confirm its authenticity... ...A MAP OF THE AXIOM appears... ...Draws directions to the bridge... ...A command flashes: "DELIVER TO AXIOM SUPERIOR"... 
Eve is ecstatic. She snaps the plant up with her tractor beam. Seals it safely in her chest. Then scoops up Wall-E in her arms. Spins him around. 
EVE Wall-E! (Laughs) 
Wall-E can't believe his luck. Rests his head on her shoulder. Bliss. 
Eve stops spinning. Leans her head against his. A tiny ARC OF ELECTRICITY passes between them. A "thank you" kiss. 
Wall-E's METER spikes. He floats circles in space. 
WALL-E (swoons) 
EVE (hums) [Come on. Time's a wastin'.] 
She reaches for his hand. Wall-E shakes his head. Holds up his extinguisher instead. 
WALL-E (beeps) [I can fly myself.] 
Kicks on the extinguisher. Spins in a pirouette... ...and flies away. Eve giggles. Chases after him. 
BING CROSBY'S "STARDUST" PLAYS 
HIS FOOT 
It's tapping in time to the music. His gaze drifts over to the plant in his hands. He lifts it up. Makes the boot dance. 
CAPTAIN ...You made it somehow, eh little guy? You didn't give up, did you? 
As if in response, the plant wilts slightly. A leaf drops. 
CAPTAIN (Gasp!) Oh no, no -- (remembers) Wait a minute. 
The Captain urgently hovers across the room. Eve left alone. Her recorded memories continue playing... 
...The clip changes to It Only Takes a Moment. 
Eve recognizes the music. Watches the lovers on screen hold hands. Something familiar about the gesture... Looks at her own hands. Slowly, she interlocks her fingers... ...Eve's eyes go wide. This is what Wall-E was trying to say to her. 
Her memories continue on the screen: ...a tap on the shoulder... ...Wall-E presents her the plant -- ...The screen goes BLACK! 
Then... 
...SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE initiates. 
Wall-E's vigil for Eve plays out: ...protecting her from the rain... ...the sun...the sandstorm... ...keeping watch night and day... ...trying to jump start her heart... 
ON EVE 
Amazed at Wall-E's selfless dedication to her. Realizes the meaning of Wall-E's love. 
EVE (soft) Wall-E... 
She looks at her hands again. 
MATCH CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF WALL-E'S HANDS 
Still waiting between the towel racks. Rehearses holding out his hand to Eve. 
WALL-E Ee-vah... Ee-VAH...? EEE-vah... (gives up; beeps) [I'll never get it right.] 
Becomes impatient. Sneaks his way over to the GARBAGE CHUTE. Sticks his head in. 
WALL-E EE-VAHH?! 
No answer. The chute has an endless drop. Wall-E climbs in. 
Holds himself spread eagle to stay in place. Carefully inches his way up to the Captain's quarters... 
OUT ON THE UPPER DECK 
A monorail pulls up. M-O steps off. Still hot on Wall-E's trail. Scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby. Then notices Wall-E's FRESH TRACKS... 
...leading to the trash chute. 
M-O (beeps) [Ah-hah! Gotcha!] 
BACK IN THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS 
The Captain at his wet bar. Waters the plant in the sink. 
CAPTAIN There you go little guy. You came a long way for a drink of water... Just needed someone to look after you, that's all -- 
He is struck with a notion. Stares out the window at space for a beat. Sees HIS REFLECTION holding the plant. Glances at his EARTH GLOBE. 
CAPTAIN (to himself) We have to go back. 
Activates his chair's call button. 
The CEO races out of the room. The message cuts out. 
Auto turns to face the Captain. The Captain shakes his head in disgust. 
AUTOPILOT Now, the plant. 
CAPTAIN No, wait a minute. Computer, when was that message sent to the Axiom? 
The paused image on the holo-screen highlights. Data begins to calculate on the screen. We see YEARS SCROLL RAPIDLY BACKWARDS. It stops on "2110". 
SHIP'S COMPUTER Message received in the year 2110. 
CAPTAIN That's -- that's nearly 700 years ago!! Auto, things have changed! We've got to go back! 
AUTOPILOT Sir, orders are: "Do not return to Earth". 
CAPTAIN But life is sustainable now! Look at this plant, green and growing! It's living proof he was wrong. 
AUTOPILOT Irrelevant, Captain. 
CAPTAIN What?! It's completely relevant! (points out to space) Out there is our home! Home, Auto! And it's in trouble! I can't just sit here and...and...do nothing! That's all I've done! That's all anyone on this blasted ship has ever done...NOTHING!! 
AUTOPILOT On the Axiom you will survive. 
CAPTAIN I DON'T WANT TO SURVIVE! I WANT TO LIVE! 
AUTOPILOT Must follow my directive. 
CAPTAIN DAAAARGH!! 
The Captain turns away in frustration. His eyes catch sight of the CAPTAIN PORTRAITS. Notices AUTO in every one of them. Looking over all their shoulders. A little closer every generation. The Captain slowly looks over his shoulder... ...and Auto is right behind him. The Captain looks at the plant in his lap. His countenance grows determined. He rights his hat... ...turns to face Auto... ...and gives the most authoritative order of his career: 
CAPTAIN I'm the Captain of the Axiom. We are going home today! 
Auto slides into his face. Makes the Captain flinch. No more Mr. Nice Robot. Auto emits an ELECTRONIC COMMAND. 
GOPHER 
shoots out of a pneumatic tube. Salutes Auto. Eve immediately remembers him from the Pod Bay. She BEEPS a warning to the Captain. 
CAPTAIN Gopher? 
Gopher activates his suspension beam. 
Snatches the plant away from the Captain. 
CAPTAIN Hey! That's my plant. This is mutiny! (to Eve) Eve, arrest him! 
Eve draws her GUN ARM. Points it at Gopher. The robot raises his epaulet arms. Don't shoot! She opens her chest cavity. Motions for Gopher to put the plant inside her. 
CAPTAIN Eve, you are to put this plant straight in the Holo-detector. 
Gopher slowly advances towards Eve. But then tosses the plant across the room... 
...down the TRASH CHUTE. 
CAPTAIN No! 
EVE (hums) [Oh no!] 
It's over. The plant is gone. But in that frozen moment... 
ON TRASH CHUTE 
...THE PLANT suddenly reappears. Rises like a ghost, up from the chute. Wall-E's head follows. Unawares of the plant resting on his head. 
A steward moves down the hall. Siren wailing. Scans for rogue robots. Eve and Wall-E's "Warning" image on his display screen. He stops in front of... 
A YELLOW LINE 
painted haphazardly on the floor. Follows it to a STORAGE CLOSET door. 
STEWARD Wrong. 
The steward opens the closet. Inside, a PAINT-BOT hides his head in the corner. The yellow line leads straight to his rear brush. The Steward apprehends him with his SUSPENSION BEAM. 
Suddenly, everything begins to shake. The steward looks around, confused. A JET ENGINE NOISE builds. Seems to be coming from... 
...the hallway TRASH CHUTE. 
Eve, Wall-E & M-O burst out from it. The paint-bot recognizes Wall-E. Beeps the POYSC song. Our savior has arrived! The steward's alarm goes haywire. 
ON STEWARD'S POV DISPLAY 
He takes a snapshot: Eve, holding Wall-E, holding the plant... 
...and Eve is aiming her gun straight at camera. 
ANGLE ON STORAGE CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER 
The terrified steward is thrown in. 
STEWARD Please hold. We are currently having technical difficul -- ! 
Eve locks the door on him. The trio take off down the hall. The freed paint-bot gives chase. Cheers POYSC as he follows. Wall-E, only half-functioning, gets an idea. Presses his PLAY BUTTON. POYSC BLARES through the hallway. 
ON VARIOUS HALLWAYS 
REJECTS come out of hiding as they hear the music. Parade after Eve and Wall-E. Hum POYSC. All following the pied piper. 
ON SCREENS AROUND THE AXIOM 
Eve and Wall-E's "Wanted" image instantly circulates. Alarms sound. Alert screens pop up around the sleeping ship. 
SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue robots... 
INT. BRIDGE 
Auto observes the same "Wanted" image. 
AUTO Not possible. 
Raises a screen showing a DECK PLAN OF THE AXIOM. It highlights Eve and Wall-E's location. Auto activates every steward on the Axiom. 
ON VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE AXIOM - NIGHT 
Stewards eject from their wall stations. Like ATMs jumping to life. Race in the direction of Eve. Carelessly knock over stray passengers in their way. 
SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) ...Caution: Rogue Robots... 
BACK ON THE BRIDGE 
Auto watches the deck plan display. Monitors the progress of all the stewards. The CAMERA DROPS THROUGH THE FLOOR, down to... 
THE CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS 
The Captain, still trapped. Rams his hover chair against the locked elevator door. Has no effect. 
CAPTAIN (hoarse; exhausted) Mutinyyy...Mute...neee...This is your last chance...Auto...You hear me?...Stupid...wheel... 
SHIP'S COMPUTER (V.O.) ...Caution: Rogue robots...Caution: Rogue robots... 
AUTO Not possible. 
CAPTAIN (ON SCREEN) That's right! The plant! Oh, you want it? Come and get it, Blinky! 
AUTO No. 
INT. CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - SAME 
The Captain   hovers in front of Eve's memory screen. It projects   a STILL IMAGE OF WALL-E HOLDING THE PLANT. The Captain   blocks the camera's view of Wall-E. Pretends to   be holding the projected plant himself. 
CAPTAIN Ha ha! 
HEARS AUTO coming. Turns off the vid-com. 
Yanks his bundle of wires out of the wall. The room goes dark again. 
CLOSE ON CEILING 
The aperture opens. Auto lowers into the dark. Cautiously searches the empty room... 
AUTO Captain? Captain...? 
ON AUTO'S POV 
PANS across the portraits of other captains... ...past our present Captain... ...The eyes in the portrait dart nervously... -- wait a minute. 
The Captain lunges at him. Grabs Auto by the steering wheel. Hangs onto it like Cap'n Ahab in a gale. His lower extremities of no use. 
AUTO Let go. Let go. 
Auto panics. Zips back up through the hole in the ceiling. The Captain gets stuck between floors... 
CAPTAIN What too heavy for ya, huh?! 
UP ON THE BRIDGE 
...Auto tries to pull free. The Captain won't let go. Auto ends up yanking him through. The Captain rides Auto like a bucking bronco. Auto swings violently back and forth. 
CAPTAIN You're not getting away from me, one-eye! -- OOF! -- Is that all you got?! 
Gopher drops out of his pneumatic tube. Sees the Captain fighting Auto. Charges at the Captain... 
...who kicks him straight out the window... 
ON LIDO DECK 
Gopher plummets... ...his SHADOW growing over the POOL... ...and smashes in a heap on the cement. The end. 
ON WALL-E AND EVE 
We PAN OVER the smoking wreckage of the stewards. The massage-bot floats above it all. Pants like a wild beast. One steward still twitches. The massage-bot crushes him with one blow. 
Eve grabs Wall-E and the plant. They take off for the Concourse Level. M-O and the Rejects follow behind. 
ON THE BRIDGE 
CAPTAIN That's it!...A little closer! Must..press...button. 
The Captain reaches his one free hand out for... ...the HOLO-DETECTOR BUTTON. 
CAPTAIN Gotcha! Ha ha! 
His hand slams down hard on it. KLAXONS sound all over the ship. 
VARIOUS ANGLES AROUND THE AXIOM 
ON LIDO DECK 
The holo-detector begins to lower back into the floor... Wall-E is still hanging onto it. Barely functioning. He uses all his strength... 
...and wedges himself under the UPPER LIP of the detector. 
Stops it from disappearing into the floor. The pressure squeezes Wall-E into a box. 
ON BRIDGE 
The holo-detector button buzzes and flashes. Something's wrong. Auto calls up a LIDO DECK SECURITY CAMERA VIEW. Discovers Wall-E wedged in the device. 
AUTO No. 
Auto presses down on the "off" button. 
ON WALL-E 
The holo-detector's hydraulics fight against him. Wall-E desperately fights to hold it up. Begins slowly to expand himself... 
...and push the holo-detector back up!! 
ON BRIDGE 
The Captain watches Wall-E's heroic rise on screen. Auto flips out his TASER. Jams it into the "off" button. Short circuits it. 
CAPTAIN NO!! 
BACK ON WALL-E 
The holo-detector reverses full force. Crushes Wall-E. We can't tell if he survived the crush. 
Eve calls out for him. Trapped, holding up the monorail car above the passengers. 
BACK ON BRIDGE 
The Captain watches Wall-E being crushed. That's it. He braces his arms against the floor... 
...and rises up on HIS OWN TWO FEET... 
ON JUMBOTRON SCREEN 
The passengers collectively GASP. Their Captain is standing... ...and walking himself up the railing... ...towards Auto! They CHEER! 
ON BRIDGE 
Auto hears the distant cheering. Wonders what's up. 
CAPTAIN (O.S.) Auto! 
Auto whips around. Shocked to see the Captain standing (albeit wobbly). Finds himself face to face with him. Auto flips out his TASER. Rushes at him. The Captain grabs it. They wrestle. The taser ARCS in the Captain's face. He flinches. Looks up. Sees a CONTROL PANEL high up on Auto's column... 
...and smirks. 
The Captain looks Auto in the eye. Raises a finger up to the control panel... ...to the "AUTOPILOT" BUTTON... ...and flicks the switch to "MANUAL". 
CAPTAIN (grits his teeth) Auto, you are relieved of duty. 
AUTO Noo -- 
Auto is instantly turned off. The Captain smiles triumphantly. Grabs the wheel with both hands. Makes the ship level again. 
ON LIDO DECK 
The passengers all spill across the deck. Shaken but OK. Eve sets the monorail down. Rockets over to the holo-detector. 
A RED DOT 
appears on the ground. The cockroach watches the dot run down the hillside. The ground begins to shake. Daylight dims. The insect looks to the sky. 
ON CLOUD COVER 
A DARK PATCH grows behind the clouds. Blots out the sunlight. The Axiom's keel breaks through. Its shadow swallows up the entire landscape. 
The cockroach senses his master's return. HUNDREDS OF RED DOTS rush past him. He eagerly chases after them. 
ON AXIOM 
The city-size starliner lowers gracefully from the sky. Pushes back the clouds to the horizon. 
EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF BAY - AXIOM PORT 
The CIRCLE OF DOTS triangulate over the abandoned berth. Converge over the port's LANDING SHAFT. Thousands of feet deep. The ship's keel descends into it. The earth shudders. Trash towers tumble in the distance. 
...Then all is quiet. 
ON BELLY OF THE AXIOM 
A ROW OF GIANT DOORS open on the side of the ship. MULTIPLE GANGWAYS automatically extend. Connect with BUILT-IN TERMINALS on the port. 
The Captain walks out gingerly. Holding the boot w/ plant. The other passengers step out on their own legs. Wobble like toddlers. They squint up at the harsh sunlight. A commotion is heard from the back. Somebody trying to push through. 
EVE 
appears out of the crowd. Cradles a BOXED UP WALL-E in her arms. 
M-O and the Rejects follow behind her. They rush across the gangway. 
The cockroach meets up with Eve. Climbs up onto Wall-E. Doesn't understand why his master isn't responding. Eve urgently scans the landscape. Locks on to WALL-E'S TRUCK in the distance. She takes to the air. M-O and the Rejects chase after her down the gangway. 
M-O (beeps) [Eve! Wait!] 
The Captain respectfully removes his hat. Good luck, friend. 
INT. WALL-E'S TRUCK 
The interior is dark and still. Suddenly the junk jingles and clinks as the back door opens. Eve flies inside with Wall-E. Sets him on the floor. 
She scans the rotating shelves at high speed. Grabs a CAR JACK. Ratchets up Wall-E's crushed body... 
QUICK SHOTS 
...SPARE PARTS being grabbed by Eve... ...Frantically installs the new parts into Wall-E... ...Her arms a blur of precision in motion... ...Replaces his damaged CIRCUIT BOARD. The final piece... ...She opens his new solar panels... 
...and BLASTS a hole in the ceiling with her gun. 
OUT ON THE EMPTY BAY 
The rejects stop. See the roof of Wall-E's truck explode. Oh no. 
BACK IN THE TRUCK 
A shaft of sunlight beams down on Wall-E. Eve holds her breath, watches... Waits... 
...Beep... ...Beep... 
WALL-E (O.S.) (Apple "reboot" SFX) 
Wall-E's meter fully charges. His head slowly rises from his box. Blinks. The cockroach hops with joy. Eve is relieved. 
...She holds out her hand to him.

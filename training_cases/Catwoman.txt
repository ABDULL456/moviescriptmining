FADE IN ON: 
INT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT 
START ON THE FACE of A GOLDEN CAT STATUE. This is the cat- god BAST, lithe, noble, beautiful. CAMERA MOVES to reveal the statue is 50 feet tall, dominating this space. Other images of CATS -- hieroglyphics, ceramics -- abound, as do -- REAL CATS, hundreds of them, slinking in the shadows on ramps cut into the sandstone walls of this Egyptian temple. At Bast's feet, EIGHT ACOLYTES in GOWNS kneel in a semi- circle around a flaming BRAZIER. Some of the women WEEP, others PRAY or stare stoically ahead. From outside, we now hear DISTANT SCREAMS, the sounds of MARAUDERS. There's a RHYTHMIC BANGING at the massive BRONZE TEMPLE DOORS. 
EXT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT 
THE TEMPLE is an impressive place of worship -- tapered columns and an ornate Egyptian facade -- at the apex of a hilltop VILLAGE, in FLAMES, under ATTACK by a PERSIAN ARMY. 
SUPERIMPOSE:   "496 B.C." 
WHAM! THE STEEL PRONG of a mounted BATTERING RAM swings into the ornate DOORS of the temple. PERSIAN SOLDIERS operate the brutal siege engine, SLAM the doors again and again. 
INT. TEMPLE OF BAST - NIGHT 
The HIGH PRIESTESS wears a special HOODED WHITE GOWN that mostly conceals her face. She moves from one ACOLYTE to the next, pours a DARK LIQUID from a bejeweled decanter into golden goblets, then pours one for herself. She raises her goblet toward BAST, as do the others -- they drink in unison. 
HIGH ANGLE as the GOBLETS CLATTER to the floor and the WOMEN SLUMP to the ground... dead. PULL BACK -- we're watching this from the PERSPECTIVE of an EGYPTIAN MAU CAT -- slim, elegant, dark-spotted gray and black fur, a SCARAB MARK on its head. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THE MAU lets out a CRY... which prompts an eerie, growing CHORUS of MEOWS and HOWLS from the other CATS. THE CATS emerge from the hiding places en masse, leaping from niches, converging on the bodies. The MAU leads the way, moves to the high priestess and puts its mouth to hers... ON THE TEMPLE DOORS - at last they BUCKLE and swing open. THE SOLDIERS, bearing TORCHES and SWORDS, storm inside. They grab anything of value, SMASH and DEFACE everything else. At the foot of BAST lie nine ROBES... but there's no sign of the women who wore them. SOLDIERS slash the robes with their swords anyway, then snatch up the goblets for booty. An unearthly CRY -- half-human, half-feline -- from somewhere high above the rampaging soldiers. They freeze, looking around frantically. More EERIE CRIES echo off the walls, from all directions. The SOLDIERS raise their weapons, clustering defensively. From out of the shadows above them, DARK HUMAN FORMS suddenly leap down with impossible agility. STAY ON THE FACE OF BAST, peering down impassively. The torch-cast SHADOWS of the violence below play upon the statue's golden surface... FLAILING SWORDS, the swift SILHOUETTES of NAKED WOMEN. We hear the GUTTURAL CRIES of the soldiers, clearly outmatched in this mortal combat. MOVE TO THE CATS, perched above the fray, looking downward as they pace the temple's ledges and ramps excitedly. THE MAU takes a final look at its handiwork, then leaps up, slinks through a crevice at the roof, and emerges on -- 
CUT TO: 
A ROOFTOP 
We hear the modern SOUNDS of passing AUTO TRAFFIC.    CAMERA ROTATES to reveal -- 
EXT. EDNA'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
THE MAU settles by a SATELLITE DISH, looking down on a present-day suburban street, a busy main drag. MARSHLAND and WATER are visible not far away, light RAIN FALLS. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SUPERIMPOSE:        "2500 YEARS LATER." 
The MAU watches as, ACROSS THE STREET, a BUS pulls away from the curb to reveal a WOMAN in a HOODED WHITE PONCHO -- the outfit recalls the high priestess of Bast. The HOOD is thrown back, revealing PATIENCE PRICE, 25-35, attractive but inclined to conceal her looks -- hair over her face, baggy clothes under her poncho. She's cautious, eager to please, to do what's expected of her -- a bit of a doormat. Patience looks up from an address scribbled on a scrap of paper, and straight toward the cat on the roof -- almost as if she'd sensed its presence. She smiles. THE MAU holds her gaze for a beat, then slinks out of sight. 
EXT. EDNA'S HOME - DAY 
An eccentric, ramshackle home amongst neat, well-kept houses. PATIENCE moves to the front door, RINGS. As she waits, she notes the lawn GRASS grown high, CLIMBING CAT SCULPTURES on the shingles. A SIGN by the door: "FELINE RESCUE SOCIETY." EDNA POWERS opens the door on a chain. She's 50-70, a former academic, intelligent, charming, but quite intimidating. 
EDNA 
Yes? 
PATIENCE 
Hi, Edna Powers? (off her nod) I'm Patience Price, I called about adopting a cat? I saw your flyer at my vet's office -- 
EDNA 
Oh yes, do come inside. EDNA undoes the chain, opens the door for her. 
INT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
PATIENCE, out of her poncho, fills out a questionnaire on a clipboard. Numerous CATS roam the premises. Feline artwork and curios, scratching posts, furry toys... cat paradise. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
... Ma'am? EDNA is putting out DRY CAT FOOD in numerous BOWLS. 
EDNA 
You may call me Edna. 
PATIENCE 
Edna. Some of these questions are... kind of personal. Do you really need to know how many, um, partners I've had in the past year? 
EDNA 
I'm not interested in your love life. But I do want to know what sort of home environment you're offering, your degree of commitment... 
PATIENCE 
Guess I wouldn't need the cat if... Patience forces a laugh, fills in a ZERO and passes the clipboard to EDNA. The woman puts down the cat food, slips on the reading glasses she wears on a chain around her neck. 
EDNA 
The application is mostly a formality.   I have a sense about people. 
Cats see things we don't.   Our secret selves -- our souls. 
PATIENCE 
Mm.   Do you have any Band-Aids? 
CUT TO: 
INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
CAMERA MOVES THROUGH this modest, neat studio apartment, PAST a BULLETIN BOARD with numerous PHOTOS. One or two show a YOUNG PATIENCE, there's a picture of a LITTLE GIRL between TWO SMILING PARENTS on a ROLLER COASTER. Mostly, though, they're snapshots of a chubby TABBY CAT, from kitten hood to old age. Suddenly, MIDNIGHT LUNGES INTO FRAME, attacking a picture of FATSO, ripping it from the bulletin board. KEEP MOVING PAST WINDOWS facing on the street and an adjacent BUILDING across an alley -- it's a corner apartment on the second floor. CAMERA HOLDS ON A TV, where a classic OLD MOVIE like Now, Voyager plays. At a key, romantic moment, 
CUT TO COMMERCIAL -- 
LAUREL AVENAL strides TOWARD CAMERA -- statuesque, perfect, a supermodel. We hear the VOICE of GEORGES AVENAL: 
GEORGES (V.O.) 
You know who you are. You know what you're after. A MALE MODEL steps INTO FRAME, reaches for her -- 
GEORGES (V.O.) 
You know you're too good for any man... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Laurel raises an eyebrow haughtily and SLAPS his face.     She moves past the male model to -- -- GEORGES AVENAL. He's Laurel's husband and the company C.E.O., handsome and charismatic. LAUREL falls into his arms. He caresses her, deeply in love. Georges WINKS. 
GEORGES 
... almost. CUT TO a PRODUCT SHOT of a JAR OF CREAM, the name "BEAUNIQUE" and the AVENAL LOGO. 
GEORGES (V.O.) 
Beaunique by Avenal. You know you want it. CLOSE ON LAUREL as she tosses her hair back, Gilda-style, with a seductive pout. She purses her lips in a kiss. REVERSE ANGLE -- PATIENCE watches with a curled lip, on the couch in a T-shirt and shorts, EATING CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM directly from a pint carton, a dark smear around her mouth. Suddenly, MIDNIGHT POUNCES at the SPOON OF ICE CREAM. Patience jerks back, startled, raises the spoon out of reach. 
PATIENCE 
No -- this is mine! MIDNIGHT doesn't back off, jumping repeatedly at the spoon, climbing over Patience, getting a rear PAW in the open pint. 
PATIENCE 
Oh, gross, you -- just take it. Patience offers the cat the half-empty pint. As MIDNIGHT digs in happily, burying his head in the container -- 
LIGHTS COME ON in the apartment across the way. PATIENCE hesitates only an instant, sticks the spoon in her mouth, CLICKS OFF the TV and flips off a LAMP by the sofa. THROUGH THE WINDOW, A HANDSOME MAN -- his name is TOM LONE -- crosses past. PATIENCE sighs in the dark, moving for a better view.      This voyeurism is a guilty habit. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LONE checks his mail, loosens his tie, unbuttons his shirt. 
PATIENCE 
Welcome home, sweetie. How was work today...? (male voice) Same old same old. All I wanna do is get out of this shirt and give you a big old hug... LONE is distracted, reading his mail, shirt still on. MIDNIGHT, meanwhile, pulls her head out of the ice cream and leaps onto the windowsill -- she looks first at Lone, then at Patience, who looks around her. 
PATIENCE 
Down in front... Come on, you, off with the shirt. Instead, LONE is moving out of view.    PATIENCE moves in the same direction, into her BATHROOM. 
INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
THE BATHROOM WINDOW faces into Lone's bedroom. He starts to unbutton his shirt, glances casually out the window -- PATIENCE immediately ducks out of sight.     A moment later, she rises slowly to peek out again -- THE WINDOW is DARK, LONE has turned off THE LIGHT. PATIENCE flips ON THE LIGHT, studies her face in the mirror. 
PATIENCE 
Lame, lame, lame. She wipes a bit of chocolate from the corner of her mouth. She tries a seductive pout, a la Laurel, gives her hair a seductive toss -- it winds up in her eyes and mouth. ON PATIENCE'S WINDOW -- from across the alley, we see PATIENCE before her mirror, brushing her hair. PULL BACK to reveal we're watching with TOM LONE, who spies on Patience through his own window, lights off. He SIGHS. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AVENAL HQ - SHOWROOM - DAY 
MOVING CAMERA delivers an assault on the senses: MIRRORS, oversized versions of the BEAUTY PRODUCTS, charts of COLOR CHOICES, shelves upon shelves of slickly-packaged COSMETICS. Prominent is a DISPLAY for BEAUNIQUE. HIP MUSIC in BG. AVENAL GIRLS, perfectly coiffed and made-up Barbie dolls, busily paint the faces of CLIENTS, women of all ages and backgrounds, in high-tech MAKE-UP CHAIRS that resemble torture devices. PATIENCE crosses through, pausing to take off her sneakers and pull on a pair of high heels. SALLY -- an Avenal girl in a prim outfit, working on a matronly CUSTOMER -- looks up to greet PATIENCE. We now see Patience has a small SCRATCH on her cheek, poorly covered with makeup. 
SALLY 
Look what the cat dragged in. 
PATIENCE 
(touching her cheek) I know, I know, I'm late -- Midnight thought there was a mouse in my pillow. 
SALLY 
This is why I only sleep with my own species. Lunch at Joey's? PATIENCE nods and waves as she hurries through a set of doors to an ELEVATOR BANK. 
INT. AVENAL HQ - ACCOUNTING BULLPEN - DAY 
OVERHEAD ANGLE on a rat's maze of office cubicles, peopled with ACCOUNTING STAFF. FIND PATIENCE tapping at her terminal, sipping COFFEE. It's a grim little space, enlivened by a GARFIELD toy, some New Yorker cartoons. PATIENCE seems bored by the drone work -- then she cocks her head at something on the screen, leans closer. She double- checks DATA in the print-outs. Something doesn't tally. ON SCREEN -- among a long list of figures, we see "YP-3" highlighted, followed by a series of numbers. PATIENCE gets up quickly with the printouts, she spills a few drops of COFFEE on her white blouse. She dabs at these distractedly as she moves through the bullpen toward a glassed-in office. She knocks on the open door, where we see the name "D. BERGER - ACCOUNTING." 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
Dave, I was just going over the first quarter expenses. Our lab fees for this one additive -- YP-3 -- have gone through the roof. BERGER, a balding, bespectacled accountant, looks up as Patience moves around his desk to show him some figures. 
PATIENCE 
Look at this, an overage of eight hundred percent on "extruded pellets" alone -- I'm not even sure what that is -- 
You can afford some peroxide, can't you?    Do something about this mousy hair. GEORGES runs a hand distastefully through her frizzy hair, then takes a moment to study her. 
GEORGES 
Stain on your blouse, run in your pantyhose -- and that color's awful on you. (fingering her outfit) Do you own an iron? Show me your hands. Shaking, Patience extends her hands. Georges inspects her trembling fingers. He seems saddened, clucks his tongue. 
GEORGES 
A nail-biter... my my, you really are the "before" picture, aren't you? 
LAUREL 
I could give her the number for my manicurist -- 
GEORGES 
(waving Laurel off) What's your name? 
PATIENCE 
Patience... 
GEORGES 
I haven't got all day -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
No, my name's Patience, Patience Price.   I'm in accounting. 
GEORGES 
I'm afraid that's no excuse. Regardless of your position, you do represent Avenal Beauty. I simply can't allow that to continue. 
PATIENCE 
Wait.   You're not -- firing me? 
GEORGES 
I have no choice. All we have to sell is an image -- and you are not it. You've got to go. DING! The DOOR OPENS. Patience stares at the man in disbelief, then bolts out into the SHOWROOM. STAY WITH GEORGES, LAUREL and ANGEL as the doors close. 
LAUREL 
Poor girl. GEORGES studies Laurel's face a moment, leans closer, amazed. 
GEORGES 
Is that a pimple? 
INT. JOEY'S DINER - DAY 
A retro place, PATIENCE and SALLY sit in a booth over SALADS and SODAS. Sally leans across the table, fixing Patience's make-up -- her mascara's run from crying, her nose is red. An open MAKE-UP POUCH rests between them. 
PATIENCE 
I try, Sally, I really do. I read Vogue, I wear uncomfortable shoes... I've been a female all my life, you'd think I'd be better at it by now. 
SALLY 
Watch the frown lines, you'll need a lift before you're forty. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
He's right, I'm not even presentable enough to be an accountant. Maybe the church needs a new bell- ringer. 
SALLY 
Look, he was just in a bad mood.   Sales are down, his marriage is on the rocks -- 
PATIENCE 
How do you know that? 
SALLY 
I have an enquiring mind. This is "Nympho," very hot, I snagged it from the showroom... She opens a tube of LIPSTICK, starts applying it expertly to Patience's lips as she speaks. 
SALLY 
Laurel's losing her looks, she's dumber than her cockapoo -- buzz is, Georges is trading her in for next year's model. All I'm saying is, by now he's probably forgotten about canning you. 
PATIENCE 
I don't care.    No way am I going back there. 
SALLY 
Shut up, you'll smear... voila, now suck your finger. Patience puts her finger in her mouth, pulls it out with a pop, to keep the lipstick off her teeth. She studies the residue on her finger. 
PATIENCE 
I can't believe we put this stuff on our mouths. Grease, acid and ground-up fish scales... who knows what they put in our mascara... 
SALLY 
GEORGES 
Impossible, this has to be an error.     Are you responsible for this data? 
BERGER 
Well, actually Patience Price brought the matter to my attention -- 
GEORGES 
Yes, yes, I'm familiar with Ms. Price. Obviously her bookkeeping is as sloppy as her appearance. 
BERGER 
Sir, she's a very reliable employee -- 
GEORGES 
I've heard enough, Berger. In the future, double- check your figures before you waste my time -- and then put it in a memo. 
WITH BERGER 
BERGER 
(on phone) In all fairness, Mr. Avenal, I think -- 
BEEP. He's talking to a dial tone.      Berger hangs up, frustrated and chagrined. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY 
START on a JEWELRY DISPLAY, a ritzy DIAMOND NECKLACE. SALLY's face appears in the window, beaming. 
SALLY 
Wow... sorry, Patience, I just found a new best friend. PATIENCE, beside her, WHISTLES appreciatively, then moves on. 
PATIENCE 
I'm sick of drooling over things I'll never have. The two are WINDOW-SHOPPING, passing a SHOE STORE, boots and high-heels... A WESTERNWEAR SHOP, belt buckles, WHIPS... 
SALLY 
Oh, you're a ray of sunshine. Tell you what, let me take you clubbing this weekend -- 
PATIENCE 
I'm not sure I'm fit to be seen in public. 
SALLY 
You will be in that dress.   I've had my eye on it for weeks. SALLY points at a MANNEQUIN in the window of a trendy boutique, garbed in a dramatic, sexy outfit -- a short bodice, a tiny skirt, plenty of plastic skin showing. 
PATIENCE 
Sally, that is not a dress, it's a rumor of a dress. It's barely forensic evidence of a dress. 
SALLY 
It's a genuine Gaultier knock-off -- 
PATIENCE 
It's not me. 
SALLY 
But don't you ever wanna be somebody else? 
PATIENCE 
I just wish I could be ten years old again -- it didn't matter what I wore as long as I could climb a tree in it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SALLY 
Your tomboy days are over. 
PATIENCE 
That's my bus, Sal, see you later. PATIENCE trots toward a BUS, SALLY calls after her. 
SALLY 
This weekend, Patience. I swear, I'm gonna make you have fun if it kills you... As Sally moves on, CAMERA LINGERS ON the window of A LINGERIE STORE, scantily-clad MANNEQUINS, including one in BLACK UNDIES and a CAT MASK. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BERGER'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
DAVE BERGER, the accountant, dressed casually, gets out of a CAB and heads into his modest home. 
INT. BERGER'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
Berger SNIFFS the air quizzically as he lets himself in. He moves toward the KITCHEN. In the kitchen DOORWAY, he fumbles for a LIGHT SWITCH, flicks it on and -- 
EXT. BERGER'S TOWNHOUSE - NIGHT 
KA-BOOM!     The WINDOWS BLOW OUT with a HUGE EXPLOSION. ACROSS THE STREET, a BLACK MERCEDES pulls from the curb, HEADLIGHTS OFF, and ACCELERATES away. 
NEIGHBOR 
Edna, your cats have been using my garden as a litter box again. 
EDNA 
(gravely) You can't change their nature. The neighbor scowls and returns to her weeding. As EDNA bends down for her newspaper, she hears a MEOW and sees -- -- Midnight licking a HAND, which protrudes from under a bush. Edna GASPS, moves closer, crouching to get a better look. It's PATIENCE, sound asleep, body twisted sideways in an unnatural position. Quietly: 
EDNA 
Hello...? 
Patience starts awake, looking around, confused. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
EDNA 
What are you doing in my hedge? Patience rolls out from under the bushes, crouches on her haunches now, a panicky look in her eyes. Leaves and dirt cling to her clothes. She has no idea how she got here. 
INT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
PATIENCE is wrapped in a BLANKET, sitting on the couch, MIDNIGHT nuzzling her, as EDNA brings her a cup of TEA.      Edna picks up a CLIPBOARD from a coffee table. 
EDNA 
Your name is Patience Price, you live on South 87th. (beat) You love chocolate -- you're afraid of heights? Any of this ring a bell? Patience nods slowly, puts her face in her hands. 
PATIENCE 
I... it's coming back to me. But last night... it's just... it's like a dream. 
EDNA 
(chiding) You said in your application that you don't drink or take drugs. 
PATIENCE 
(rising) I don't. I think... something must have happened. I need to... 
EDNA 
You need to rest. Patience takes a few steps from the couch and lets the blanket slip from her shoulders. 
EDNA 
Oh my God... Edna stares at PATIENCE'S BACK. The fabric of her dress is torn, the skin discolored beneath with a hint of dried blood -- and we make out the marks left by a TIRE TREAD. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
EDNA 
You're in no condition to -- EDNA moves beside Patience and GRABS HER by the wrist -- ON PATIENCE'S HAND, the fingers CURL and FIVE SHARP CAT CLAWS (SPFX) emerge from her fingertips -- only for an instant. EDNA blinks at this, PATIENCE whirls on her with an abrupt and frightening HISS -- CLOSE, Patience's pupils become ELLIPTICAL for a blink, flecked with GOLD, then -- She yanks her hand away quickly, immediately looks contrite, and a bit dazed from the momentary transformation. 
PATIENCE 
Sorry, you -- you startled me... look, Edna, thanks for everything, but -- I just want to get home and take a bath. Edna nods, unnerved. PATIENCE picks MIDNIGHT up in her arms and hurries out the door. Edna stares after her, a disturbing thought forming. 
INT. EDNA'S HOME - OFFICE - DAY 
EDNA moves purposefully to a FILE CABINET in this cluttered, book-lined room and opens a drawer. She thumbs past many years' worth of scholarly research, finally pulling a thick, dog-eared MANILA FILE from near the back. She moves to her desk, slips on reading glasses and opens the folder -- ANGLE ON FILE -- an old, thick type-written SCHOLARLY PAPER entitled "MYTHS OF FELIGYNY, by E. POWERS Ph.D." She puts this aside, revealing a WOODCUT of an AFRICAN Catwoman in leopard skin, surrounded by cats. Next, an ASIAN CATWOMAN, a print of a 19th Century watercolor. She wears a Chinese- style MASK, close-fitting robes, a long tail. Both illustrations show the women with CLAWS and ELLIPTICAL 
PUPILS. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 
PATIENCE stares at her dirty face in the MIRROR, still reeling from the events of the previous night. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Behind her, THE BATHTUB RUNS, almost filled. She moves to the edge of the tub, starting to undo her ragged clothes, stares down at -- THE RIPPLING WATER.     She blinks, her expression far away -- 
FLASHBACK - INT. PATIENCE'S HEAD 
A vertiginous PLUNGE from the bridge toward DARK WATER -- 
INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY (PRESENT) 
PATIENCE starts, shaking off this momentary vision. She dips a finger in the water, jerks back -- much as a cat might. She shakes drops off her hand, repelled by the water. 
INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
There's KNOCKING at the door. The PHONE IS RINGING, a MACHINE picks up. We hear RUNNING WATER from beyond the closed bathroom door. 
PATIENCE (V.O.) 
This is Patience, you can leave a message if you want... 
BEEP. 
INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY 
PATIENCE turns off the TAPS, in the quiet she hears EDNA'S VOICE on her answering machine. 
EDNA (V.O.) 
PATIENCE 
I guess not... 
LONE 
Then -- bye, now. He sounds disappointed. As the door shuts, Patience clutches her hair, makes a SOUND of frustration, almost like a MEOW. 
INT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY 
PATIENCE flings open the door, calls after Lone: 
PATIENCE 
I want you... He turns, startled. Patience has a sultry, come-hither look in her eye, her VOICE has a lower, sexier tone. 
LONE 
Excuse me? She shudders. The sexy expression turns to one of shock and anxiety -- what has she done? Then, vamping: 
PATIENCE 
I want you, um, to forgive me.   For hitting you like that. 
LONE 
No need -- woman living alone, you can't take any chances. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE nods unsurely, starts to retreat into the apartment. LONE thinks, calls out to her. 
LONE 
Listen, I was gonna grab a cup of coffee... 
CUT TO: 
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
LONE and PATIENCE move from a COUNTER with COFFEE CUPS in hand. Patience has cleaned up, dressed a little sexier than usual -- she looks good. 
PATIENCE 
So, did you always want to be a policeman? (beat, rolling her eyes) God, listen to me, Conversation 101. 
LONE 
(a laugh) Hey, we gotta start somewhere. Actually, when I was a kid, I wanted to be a rock star. They take seats at a small table. 
LONE 
I was kind of a delinquent back then, got into some trouble. There was a cop who helped me out. Made a difference. I figured... maybe I could do the same. 
PATIENCE 
Plus you can still get into trouble. 
LONE 
Right, but for the good guys... So what do you do? When you're not dumpster diving or cleaning chimneys, I mean. 
PATIENCE 
Accounting.   That is, I used to, I just lost my job. 
LONE 
I'm sorry. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
Don't be, it was pretty dull.   I guess when you get down to it, I'm pretty dull. Patience realizes she's not making for a great first date. 
PATIENCE 
Let me start over. It's just... I never got into any trouble or anything -- 
LONE 
Come on, never? 
PATIENCE 
Well, when I was little, but -- after I lost my folks I... I guess I turned into sort of a scaredy- ca -- um, pretty risk-averse. 
LONE 
That's not a bad thing.   It's a pretty dangerous world. 
PATIENCE 
Sometimes I just wish I was less of a wimp. 
LONE 
You're not afraid to admit you're afraid -- that takes guts. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
CATWOMAN strutting confidently down the narrow GUARDRAIL between the two directions of SPEEDING TRAFFIC. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She could be out for an evening stroll, ignoring the SCREECHING BRAKES, HORNS, and STARTLED DRIVERS. She gives them a wave without bothering to look over her shoulder. 
EXT. TENEMENT ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
A CHICKEN-WIRE DOOR explodes open and a FLOCK OF PIGEONS ROCKETS OUT of a COOP AT CAMERA. CATWOMAN emerges in a CLOUD OF FEATHERS, brushing a few stray ones off her outfit, with a cat-that-ate-the-canary smile. She cocks her head, listening in different directions for a new source of amusement -- snippets of VOICES, MUSIC, PLUMBING SFX, passing VEHICLES... it's like tuning a radio. Then she picks up a distant TINKLE of breaking GLASS -- 
INT. JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT 
Dimly lit, an older, discount place. THIEF #1 methodically breaks DISPLAY CASES with a wrapped hammer, snatches up the contents -- necklaces, rings, etc. -- stuffing them into a 
BAG. 
As he moves, a SHADOWY FIGURE -- CATWOMAN -- moves with him, looking over his shoulder, close enough to touch but unseen. Each time he turns his head, she has just slinked out of his view -- her timing is impeccable. THIEF #2, with a SHOTGUN, stands guard over a blindfolded, bound-and-gagged NIGHT WATCHMAN. CATWOMAN appears on the periphery of his vision, but when he turns his head she's disappeared behind a case -- she emerges on the other side just before he turns back. THIEF #3 is at work on a LOCKED STEEL CASE of DRAWERS with a BLOWTORCH and TOOLS. CATWOMAN STEPS LIGHTLY across the CASE above him, he looks up -- but there's nobody there. He returns to his work, gets the CASE open and pulls out a DRAWER revealing a RACK full of glittering DIAMONDS. 
CATWOMAN (O.S.) 
Oooh, pretty. THE THREE THIEVES spin, looking around -- 
THIEF #1 
Up there! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
THIEF #2 aims his SHOTGUN at -- CATWOMAN, perched on a narrow LEDGE at the ceiling moulding. She VAULTS down just as he FIRES, a SPRAY OF PLASTER. THIEF #2 pumps his shotgun, looking around frantically. 
THIEF #2 
What the hell was that?! CATWOMAN springs out from behind a DISPLAY CASE, gives Thief #2 a roundhouse KICK in the head that sends the man into a wall, knocking him cold. THIEF #1 pulls a HANDGUN, but the END OF THE WHIP wraps around it in a flash, yanks it from his hand. CATWOMAN SNAPS HER WHIP at Thief #1 and Thief #3, backing them into a corner. As she passes the tied-up GUARD, she uses her claws to SLASH his ropes. In time with WHIP CRACKS 
CATWOMAN 
You boys -- thought you could just barge -- in here and take -- all these beautiful things -- that don't belong to you... The guard quickly tears off his GAG and BLINDFOLD, untying his own feet, then picks up the fallen handgun and trains it on the thieves. We hear POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING. CATWOMAN meanwhile swiftly gathers up fallen jewels, sweeping them into the swag bag. She pauses for a moment, thoughtful. 
CATWOMAN 
(to herself) What a lovely idea. 
With lightning speed, she vanishes out the back with the bag. THE GUARD, totally focused on the thieves, doesn't even register she's gone. THIEF #3 points -- 
THIEF #3 
Hey... 
EXT. JEWELRY STORE ALLEY - NIGHT 
CATWOMAN bounds out the exit, leaps atop BOXES, onto a window A/C UNIT, which totters with her weight, just as -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AN UNMARKED SEDAN screeches to a halt, and TOM LONE leaps out, GUN ready. He trains it on CATWOMAN -- 
LONE 
Freeze! CATWOMAN freezes. She blinks down at LONE, he's got a clean shot at her. She cocks her head, licks her lips. 
CATWOMAN 
You are cute. LONE blinks at this uncommon response to a pointed weapon, continues to play it by the book. 
LONE 
I'm a police officer! 
CATWOMAN 
Bet you look sweet in uniform.   And such a big gun... 
LONE 
I, I -- Come down here, now! 
CATWOMAN 
Obviously you don't know much about cats.   I come when I want, not when I'm told. With that, she SPRINGS to the rooftop -- the force of her leap knocks the A/C free of the window, LONE has to dive out of the way as it CRASHES to the ground. 
EXT. ROOFTOPS/CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
CATWOMAN, silhouetted against the sky, is having a great time, leaping from building to building, scrambling across rooftops. POLICE SIRENS recede in the distance. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. ZOO - DAWN 
THE SUN is rising. PAN OVER a couple of GLITTERING JEWELS in the dirt. FIND CATWOMAN in the GOLDEN MORNING LIGHT, curled against what looks like a TIGER-SKIN PILLOW. She stirs and groans in her sleep, like someone waking with a hangover. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She blinks and frowns at the SUNLIGHT. Where am I? She sits up and realizes -- she was sleeping against the belly of the BENGAL TIGER, lying on his side in his sunken ENCLOSURE. CATWOMAN SHRIEKS and leaps to her feet, terrified, yanks OFF HER MASK. With the daylight, she's back to being plain old PATIENCE. She looks down in shock at her revealing outfit; the swag bag is looped into the whip around her waist. She's awakened the TIGER. Patience lets out another frightened CRY as he eyes her, no longer recognizing her as a friend. The tiger GROWLS, gets to his feet menacingly, starts moving in for the kill. PATIENCE scrambles for a heavily LATCHED DOOR, which she frantically wrestles to open, getting through and SLAMMING IT just as the TIGER LUNGES -- 
How many have there been? 
EDNA 
No one can be sure. I've found references scattered through history, but catwomen tend to lead solitary, secretive lives. Hard to blame them, it seems most were murder victims. PATIENCE has heard enough.     She rises, freaked out. 
PATIENCE 
I was murdered? Why would anybody kill me? No, I never did anything to... I don't want to break the rules! She moves out of the room, Edna follows. 
INT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
PATIENCE paces, EDNA looks on sympathetically. 
PATIENCE 
She's like some demon, possessing me in the night, but -- but I can keep it under control during the day -- 
EDNA 
Well, cats do sleep most of the day -- 
PATIENCE 
When she takes over -- it's like, she just does whatever she feels like, she doesn't care what people think -- 
EDNA 
Is that so bad? 
PATIENCE 
You don't understand -- I'm afraid she's going to hurt someone -- or get me killed. Again. PATIENCE is near tears.     EDNA puts her arms around her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
There's got to be a way to make it stop.   Some kind of, I don't know, garlic or wolfsbane or something... 
EDNA 
(thinking) A domestic cat can return to its natural state effortlessly. But once a cat's gone feral, it can never be tamed. 
PATIENCE 
Okay... that isn't helping. EDNA pulls back, looks Patience in the eye. 
EDNA 
Relax a little, learn to live with your inner cat. Even love her -- she has many admirable qualities -- integrate her into your life. If you accept the darker impulses, try to channel them -- maybe she'll come to be domesticated -- 
PATIENCE 
No. I'm going to fight her.   I'm stronger than she is -- 
EDNA 
But you're only fighting yourself -- 
PATIENCE 
-- and I'm going to win. Patience heads out the door.     Edna shakes her head; Patience isn't getting it. 
EXT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY 
POLICE TAPE across the entrance to the storefront. PATIENCE approaches warily, looking around to make sure no one's watching, nervous as hell. She sees an elderly JEWELER and a UNIFORM COP through the window. Patience withdraws a PAPER BAG from under her coat. She drops this beyond the police tape, KNOCKS on the door and RUNS. THE JEWELER comes out, looks down on the ground. He picks up the bag -- and sees the word "SORRY!" written on the paper. Opening the bag, he finds -- THE DIAMONDS AND JEWELS that Catwoman stole. 
EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - ALLEY - DAY 
PATIENCE comes out of a back door of her building with a GARBAGE BAG, still looking around nervously, moving toward the dumpster in the alley. She tosses in the bag -- ANGLE IN DUMPSTER, the BAG spills open to reveal pieces of the CATWOMAN OUTFIT. PATIENCE moves back for the door -- 
LONE (O.S.) 
We've got to stop meeting like this. She spins to see TOM LONE approaching from his sedan, parked in a LOT off the alley. PATIENCE is wary of him now, but he seems casual, smiling. She glances at the dumpster anxiously, he follows her sight-line, snooping as always. 
LONE 
Doing some spring cleaning? 
PATIENCE 
Emptying the catbox, actually. LONE quickly takes a step back from the dumpster. 
LONE 
So -- that was a... surprising message you left for me. 
PATIENCE 
(embarrassed) Oh, well, uh -- musta been my cold medication talking. She sniffles and coughs unconvincingly. 
LONE 
Well anyway, if you still wanted to get together -- maybe we could get a bite to eat Friday night? PATIENCE pretends to think it over. 
PATIENCE 
Yeah, maybe... 
INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
PATIENCE is sitting up in bed, reading a BIOCHEMISTRY TEXT, PRINT-OUTS and RESEARCH MATERIAL around her.   She YAWNS, squirms -- something is coming over her. Her eyes pop open. 
PATIENCE 
No.   Oh no, not again. SPASMS wrack her body, her back arches, she keeps fighting it, clenching her fists, struggling for control. ON HER HANDS, her own CLAWS are drawing BLOOD from her palms. 
EXT. PATIENCE'S BUILDING - ALLEY - NIGHT 
A GLOVED HAND grips the edge of the DUMPSTER -- then CATWOMAN vaults over the side, lands on her haunches, ready to rumble. Her outfit has a banana peel stuck to it. She wrinkles her nose, plucks this off, CLUCKING her tongue. She turns to MIDNIGHT, prowling nearby. 
CATWOMAN 
That girl has got to go. She glances up toward Lone's WINDOW -- lets out a sexy GROWL -- and SPRINGS UP the fire escape. 
INT. LONE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
CATWOMAN SCRATCHES at the window... the place is DARK, no response. She PUNCHES out a pane of glass and slithers in. 
CATWOMAN 
Boy, you don't know what you're missing... She moves through the dimly lit, Spartan environment, able to see easily in the dark. She runs a CLAW over the strings of a GUITAR, finds a discarded button-down SHIRT, slips it on. She narrows her eyes when she finds a FRAMED PHOTO -- CLOSE -- TOM LONE with his arm around a pretty GIRL.    Letting out a GROWL, CATWOMAN slashes out the girl's face. IN THE BATHROOM, she opens the medicine chest, picks up men's toiletries. Finding a bottle of COLOGNE, she sprays it in the air and sniffs, then makes a face, looking at the bottle 
CLOSE ON BOTTLE -- "MACHISMO... by AVENAL." 
CATWOMAN 
Avenal... 
MOVE IN ON CATWOMAN'S FACE. 
INT. CATWOMAN'S HEAD (MEMORY MONTAGE) 
Impressionistic POV FLASHBACKS, V.O.s overlapping, echoing, repeating... all snippets of previously heard dialogue. POV -- GEORGES AVENAL, chewing Patience out in the ELEVATOR.

CONTINUED: 
EDNA (V.O.) 
Most catwomen were murder victims... 
PATIENCE (V.O.) 
I was murdered? POV -- the MERCEDES COMING AT CAMERA. This time we follow through on the moment of IMPACT -- CAMERA FLIES THROUGH THE AIR, HITTING the ground hard. 
PATIENCE (V.O.) 
Why would anybody kill me? 
BERGER (V.O.) 
... YP-3... YP-3... 
POV -- from PATIENCE, lying on the street. HER BLURRING VISION drifts toward the MERCEDES, a SILHOUETTED FIGURE behind the wheel, seen from behind. 
BERGER (V.O.) 
Avenal went ballistic... POV -- ANGEL comes out of the car, LOOMS over Patience. 
GEORGES (V.O.) 
I have no choice. POV -- GEORGES on the elevator, staring INTO CAMERA.    ANGEL is right behind him, looking menacing as usual. 
GEORGES 
You've got to go. 
INT. LONE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
SMASH!   CATWOMAN throws the COLOGNE BOTTLE against the wall. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AVENAL MANSION - NIGHT 
A sprawling MANSION,    dark for the night, an "A" in iron scroll-work over the    gate. FIND a SECURITY CAMERA, trained on the area in front    of a ten-foot WALL. MIDNIGHT suddenly leaps onto the wall,    blocking and batting at the CAMERA LENS. 
WIDER, CATWOMAN, now out of the camera's view, LEAPS up the side of the wall and lands on all fours atop it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
AT THE SIDE OF THE MANSION -- CATWOMAN scrambles up a trellis toward a second-story window. She leaps to the ledge, crouches, peering in. CLOSE as a razor-sharp CLAW emerges and CUTS a CIRCLE into a 
PANE OF GLASS. 
INT. AVENAL MANSION - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The CIRCLE OF GLASS pops out and lands on soft CARPET. CATWOMAN reaches her arm in, unlatches the window, and swings inside into the darkness. CATWOMAN moves stealthily, crouching, senses alert. 
HER POV - CATVISION 
The dark hallway GLOWS.   An amplified NOISE from a distance... SNORING. 
ON CATWOMAN'S HANDS 
Her NAILS emerge from her gloved fingertips, ready to rumble. CATWOMAN rounds a corner toward a large formal staircase that wraps around a huge chandelier. She nears a door which is slightly ajar, pushes it open silently and enters -- 
LAUREL 
(thinking frantically) He never comes home anymore -- I, I know he's got a box for the ballet Friday night -- 
CATWOMAN 
I can't wait that long.    I want him now. 
LAUREL 
I swear I don't know where he is, he's left me! Oh God, my career is in the toilet, my whole life is over -- go ahead, tear me to pieces -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LAUREL is beginning to get hysterical. Catwoman lets out a frustrated GROWL and lets go of her, this is useless. She starts for the door, Laurel sniffs back tears then follows. 
LAUREL 
Wait... try the factory. I think that's where he meets Drano, his new mistress. 
CATWOMAN 
I'll check it out. 
LAUREL 
What do you want with him, anyway? 
CATWOMAN 
It's personal. 
LAUREL 
Are you going to kill him? 
CATWOMAN 
Depends on my mood. 
LAUREL 
I'll pay you to kill him. 
CATWOMAN 
(surprised, impressed) And here I thought you were just some brain-dead mannequin -- 
LAUREL 
I'll even give you a lift, if you'll let me watch - 
CATWOMAN 
Sorry, I work alone. But I like your attitude. 
Catwoman disappears into the night.       LAUREL looks after her admiringly. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AVENAL FACTORY - GEORGES' OFFICE - NIGHT 
MOOD MUSIC plays, GEORGES is    on the sofa, in a silk robe, beside DRINA. Drinks are on     hand, Georges is attempting to neck with her. She pays him     no mind, a remote in hand, rewinding a VIDEO that plays    on a plasma SCREEN. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ON TV, IMAGES OF DRINA dissolve into each other quickly -- she DANCES IN A BALL-GOWN, CHAIRS a CORPORATE BOARD MEETING, finally pulls into the winners' circle in a FORMULA RACE CAR, pulls off her helmet and shakes her hair out. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) 
Discover the fountain of youth... in a jar. Beaunique by Avenal. DRINA hits pause, wrinkles her nose. 
DRINA 
I look fat. 
GEORGES 
We'll shoot another. Georges moves in on Drina, as the CAMERA discreetly pans to the WINDOW over the factory. 
INT. AVENAL FACTORY - NIGHT 
A small crew of NIGHT WORKERS wearing JUMPERS and PAPER MASKS tend the elaborate industrial MACHINERY, it's DEAFENING here. SWIRLING GOO the color of HUMAN SKIN PUMPS through PLASTIC PIPES into a huge SEALED VAT. RAINBOWS of NAIL POLISHES squirt out of NOZZLES into BOTTLES. LIPSTICK STICKS screw down into their TUBES and are CAPPED on 
CONVEYOR BELTS. 
OVERHEAD, amidst DUCTING and PIPES, CATWOMAN is on the move. HER CLAWS rake across a row of RUBBER TUBES, which spray multi-colored FLUIDS. 
HER GLOVED HANDS spin hydraulic VALVES. HER BOOT kicks a CONVEYOR BELT WHEEL, twisting it sideways -- the BELT JAMS, SMOKE rises from the clogged gears. A PANEL slides open over a bank of SWITCHES and WHACK-IT buttons. Her gloved fingers start HITTING THEM at random. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WITH A WORKER DRONE, CLICKING a hand counter by rote as CASES of neatly-packed jars of NAIL POLISH pass by his station. The man is half-asleep. A CASE COMES BY, a bit crooked on the belt, which is beginning to VIBRATE... The next CASE is missing half its bottles. An ALARM BLEEPS, RED LIGHTS FLASHING in b.g. The next CASE is filled with BROKEN GLASS, DRENCHED in NAIL POLISH -- it gets his attention. He THROWS LEVERS to stop the belt. WIDER, THE FACTORY is in CHAOS. STEAM     shoots out of PRESSURE TUBES, COLORED LIQUIDS bubble    out of overflowing TANKS, FACE POWDER sprays into the air    from a disconnected HOSE. WORKERS dash about frantically,     SHOUTING and PANICKED. 
INT. AVENAL FACTORY - GEORGES' OFFICE - NIGHT 
THE CHAOS in the factory is clearly visible through the window, but GEORGES can't hear a thing -- he and DRINA are groping each other on the couch now. A nearby INTERCOM is BUZZING, Georges finally pushes a talk button, angry. 
Ivan Nevski -- His head tilts back -- she's face-to-face with a CORPSE, he's been shot a couple of times in the chest. He's bluish, eyes glazed -- very dead. 
CATWOMAN 
(annoyed) You're no help. She SNIFFS the air, turns toward -- -- a SMOLDERING FIRE in the FIREPLACE. Catwoman moves toward this, studies the ASHES and BURNED PAPERS, then reaches in and snatches out -- -- the REMAINS of a TEXTBOOK.     The cover reads "YERSINIA 
PESTIS - A NATURAL HISTORY." 
The book is hot to the touch, she DROPS it, studies it. 
CATWOMAN 
Yersinia Pestis... YP... A SINGED NEWS CLIPPING protrudes from between the pages, she plucks this out. CLOSE -- "BUSINESSMAN DENIES TERRORIST LINK," with a PHOTO of XAVIER BARTOK, his name in the caption below. CATWOMAN is reading, absorbed, when -- THE FRONT DOOR swings open -- A UNIFORM COP and a LANDLADY with a ring of keys step inside -- 
LANDLADY 
Dr. Nevski, are you all -- aah! They see CATWOMAN. She HISSES, bolts for the window and vanishes while the COP still fumbles for his gun.

Lush vegetation and tropical sunlight through walls of netting in this immense camouflage tent.

CAMERA MOVES PAST racks of AIR-TO-AIR MISSILES, RPGs, a JET FIGHTER and a large military CARGO CHOPPER. XAVIER BARTOK, a well-dressed, heavyset man with a CIGAR in his mouth, accompanied by a couple of BODYGUARDS, is showing off a crate of AUTOMATIC WEAPONS to a couple of REBELS in combat fatigues. They speak in rapid SPANISH, examining the guns, sighting them, etc. XAVIER excuses himself to answer a ringing CELL PHONE.       He speaks with a vague European ACCENT. 
XAVIER (V.O.) 
(on phone) Acquisitions -- 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. AVENAL FACTORY - DAY 
WESLEY is on his cell phone on the main FACTORY FLOOR. The place is a WRECK, as WORKERS clean up the mess Catwoman made. 
WESLEY (V.O.) 
(on phone) This is supply. There's been a slight complication, my employer wishes to move up the exchange -- tomorrow night. 
XAVIER 
(snorts) Impossible -- there are issues of transport, available funds -- 
WESLEY 
We're willing to adjust the price. But if you can't pick up the goods tomorrow, we'll have to take our business elsewhere. 
XAVIER 
This isn't your first 'complication.' WESLEY unlocks a door to -- 
EXT. LOADING DOCK - DAY 
A FREIGHT ELEVATOR rises to reveal MANY CANISTERS of 
YP-3.

WESLEY waves to ANGEL at the controls of a FORKLIFT -- Angel still has dried flecks of MAKE-UP on his skin. He pulls forward, ready to load the YP-3 into a waiting TRUCK. 
WESLEY (V.O.) 
(on phone) It'll be eliminated, like the others.   We just don't want to take any chances. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PATIENCE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
ON TV, AN ARTIST'S RENDITION of CATWOMAN, made to look far more menacing and mean. 
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) 
Catwoman has struck again -- FOOTAGE of a sheet-covered CORPSE being wheeled out of Nevski's duplex. A BANNER: "CRIME BREAK," a LOCAL NEWS LOGO. 
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) 
This costumed criminal has now added murder to her resume of mischief and mayhem... REVERSE ANGLE -- PATIENCE, sprawled on the couch in baggy sweat-clothes, reacts to this with a stunned expression. ON TV, "NEWS VIDEO" of SANDY from the club. 
SANDY (V.O.) 
-- she attacked us for no reason! And her outfit, I mean, that whole S & M thing is so 90s -- THE DOORBELL RINGS, PATIENCE moves to answer, attention still on the TV. She throws the door open quickly -- 
TOM LONE takes a step backward, hands up defensively. 
LONE 
Just me -- 
PATIENCE 
Oh my God.   Our date... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Well, she is interesting, isn't she?     Kind of a... colorful character? 
LONE 
She's a thief and a killer. 
PATIENCE 
(heatedly) I don't believe that. (covering) I mean -- whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty? LONE seems a little taken aback at her vehemence. Just then, a JAPANESE WAITER places a HUGE TRAY OF SUSHI between them. 
PATIENCE 
Guess I went a little crazy ordering. 
LONE 
It's refreshing. A lot of women won't let a man see them eat. 
PATIENCE 
Right, then we go home and binge on Haagan-Dazs. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
During the following, Lone meticulously mixes soy sauce and wasabi, uses chopsticks, etc. Patience simply peels the fish off the rice and pops it in her mouth, as if eating potato chips, then licking her fingers like a cat licking its paw. 
LONE 
You do hide things, don't you. You may seem all sweet and shy, but you've got a secret wild side. 
PATIENCE 
Women in general, you mean. 
LONE 
Right.  Women in general... (watching her reaction) You know, I actually saw Catwoman the other night. From a distance. Goofy costume. 
PATIENCE 
Really?     I heard it was... sexy. 
LONE 
In a way. 
PATIENCE 
So it could be sexier... with what, maybe a wide belt? 
LONE 
Why so interested? 
PATIENCE 
You brought it up. LONE studies her for a few seconds. He seems on the verge of saying something important. But instead: 
LONE 
You want that toro? LONE is already reaching for another piece of sushi -- with lightning reflexes, PATIENCE grabs his hand to stop him -- he looks up at her, surprised. She backs off with a smile: 
PATIENCE 
No no, it's yours. She eyes the fish hungrily as he eats it. 
EXT. RIVERSIDE AREA - DAY 
LONE and PATIENCE walk close together, near the water. 
LONE 
Gonna have to get back to the station, I'm working nights. 
PATIENCE 
Catwoman again? 
LONE 
Afraid so. But I have a feeling she'll be in custody within the week. 
PATIENCE 
(alarmed) Why do you say that? 
LONE 
Individuals who feel compelled to act out through an animal alter-ego -- bats, birds, bugs, there have been a number of cases in other cities -- they catch themselves. Take too many risks, think they can play with the cops. See, they like to be watched... He's staring right at her now.     Patience looks away. HER POV -- THE SUN GETTING LOW, vanishing behind a cloud. CLOSE, PATIENCE'S PUPILS become ELLIPTICAL for a blink. LONE pauses, standing close. 
LONE 
Sorry.   Seems like all I can do is talk about work. PATIENCE spins on him, a glint in her eye. 
PATIENCE 
So stop talking. So saying, she throws her arm around his neck, the other around his back, pulls him close for a KISS. Lone takes only a moment to respond -- it's a good one -- until -- CLOSE ON LONE'S BACK as her CLAWS involuntarily emerge, tearing right through his shirt and an inch down his back -- 
(CONTINUED)

PATIENCE (O.S.) 
Edna, it worked. I think... I think I've beaten her. I'm Patience again. I've won. 
EDNA 
Oh, I'm so glad... Edna looks terribly relieved as she throws aside the bolt and begins to open the cellar door. But before she can -- -- THE DOOR FLIES OPEN, knocking her off her feet.        A FIGURE STREAKS PAST. We hear her voice as she retreats: 
CATWOMAN 
Sucker. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT 
A BALLET in progress -- "Giselle." Lithe DANCERS spin gracefully across the stage, a rustic village setting. FIND a HIGH BOX to one side. GEORGES and DRINA, in formal clothes. GEORGES is absorbed in the performance, DRINA looks bored, wrinkles her nose. 
DRINA 
What is this about? 
GEORGES 
Ssh. (impatient whisper) Giselle is mistreated by a cruel prince and kills herself. Later, the souls of betrayed women come back from the grave for revenge. DRINA makes a SNORING NOISE, puts on a WALKMAN, and is soon bobbing her head to faint ROCK MUSIC. 
EXT. CITY STREET - CONCERT HALL - NIGHT 
BALLET MUSIC CONTINUES OVER. A CITY BUS passes, an AD FOR AVENAL on the side -- it's been VANDALIZED, CLAW MARKS across the length of it. CRANE UP to find CATWOMAN crouched on the roof of the bus. She leaps off from the still-moving bus -- -- onto the ROOF of a TAXI passing the other way -- -- and finally landing at the curb near -- A classical-looking CONCERT HALL, FOUNTAINS in front. CATWOMAN creeps amongst bushes, approaching the building. Numerous COPS patrol the entrance -- no way to get past them. 
CATWOMAN creeps around the perimeter, looking for another way in. By the curb she spots -- ANGEL, alone, near a parked LIMOUSINE, lighting a cigarette. 
CATWOMAN 
Those things'll kill you. She SMACKS the cigarette out of his hand, BOOTS him into the BUSHES and leaps on top of him. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
IN THE BUSHES, CATWOMAN straddles ANGEL, bangs his head against a cement curb. 
CATWOMAN 
YP-3 -- the plague -- what's it for? 
ANGEL 
I have no idea what you're -- BANG!   She whams his head again. 
CATWOMAN 
Tell me about Xavier Bartok. 
ANGEL 
How do you know -- She BANGS his head again. 
CATWOMAN 
I'm asking the questions. 
ANGEL 
I -- I can't tell you -- She bares her CLAWS over his eyes. 
CATWOMAN 
Then it's time to brush up on your Braille. 
ANGEL 
No, no, not my eyes!      Xavier, he's the one who's buying the stuff! 
CATWOMAN 
When? 
ANGEL 
The deal goes down tomorrow night -- at the Avenal offices -- 
CATWOMAN 
Wrong.   Your boss won't live to see it. She BANGS his head hard again, ANGEL loses consciousness. 
CATWOMAN 
Thanks for your help. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CATWOMAN moves around the side of the building, keeping low, ducking behind parked cars. Fewer COPS here, but the place looks impregnable, no way to scale the walls. She tries an EMERGENCY DOOR -- locked, no good. She hisses in frustration, starts to move on when -- THE DOOR OPENS behind her.     CATWOMAN spins to see -- LAUREL, her face hidden with dark glasses and a wide-brimmed hat. She gestures frantically. Catwoman darts inside. 
INT. CONCERT HALL - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
LAUREL whips off the hat and glasses, gives a girly hug to Catwoman, who pulls back immediately. 
LAUREL 
I knew you'd come. Laurel leads Catwoman through this basement boiler room. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LONE 
(shakes his head sadly) One thing you learn in this line of work -- you never really know anybody, not completely. (professional tone) You're being charged with vandalism, burglary and the murder of Doctor Ivan Nevski -- 
PATIENCE 
He was dead when... um, Ivan who? (a beat, floundering) You, you have no proof that I -- what are you doing? LONE is unbuttoning his shirt.     He pulls down one side to reveal his shoulder. 
LONE 
These scratches were inflicted last night by Catwoman. Forensics also tested this scratch -- He turns around to show the claw-mark she left when they kissed. He turns to face her, rebuttoning his shirt. 
LONE 
They were made by the same implement. 
PATIENCE 
So this whole time, you've been flirting, buying me dinner, acting like you were interested -- I was a suspect? It was just some cat and mouse thing? LONE's a little offended, his tone becomes more aggrieved: 
LONE 
No, not at first -- I really bought the act, vulnerable girl all alone in the big city -- 
PATIENCE 
Sorry if I don't fit into your damsel in distress fantasy. 
LONE 
That's not what -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
Real people are a little more complicated. 
LONE 
Look, I didn't want to believe it, but -- 
PATIENCE 
I guess a strong woman can be intimidating to a certain kind of man -- 
LONE 
Did you really think I wasn't gonna recognize you in a little mask? I'm not blind. 
PATIENCE 
So if they don't need rescuing, you better lock them up yourself -- They're now talking over each other, sounding just like bickering lovers. LONE glances at the mirror, embarrassed; they're obviously being watched. Through his teeth: 
LONE 
Knock it off. (flat, Sgt. Friday) It'll go a lot easier on you if you just confess now. 
PATIENCE 
I've been doing some investigating of my own. A real crime. Georges Avenal is stockpiling YP-3, a variant of black plague bacteria -- 
LONE 
Oh yes, your little hobby.   Please, Patience -- 
PATIENCE 
It's a bioweapon! Ivan Nevski developed it, they must've killed him to keep it a secret -- 
LONE 
So now you've constructed a paranoid fantasy with your former boss at the center. A disgruntled employee -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE 
The deal's going down tonight, they're meeting an arms dealer named Xavier Bartok at the Avenal offices -- 
LONE 
You're hallucinating. Georges Avenal is world famous, worth millions, a respected businessman -- why in God's name would he get involved in arms trafficking? 
PATIENCE 
I don't know!    Why don't you ask him? 
LONE 
Enough.   Are you denying you're Catwoman? 
PATIENCE 
(looks away from him) It doesn't matter what I say.   You'll make me whoever you want me to be. LONE looks at her for a moment, then exits, leaving Patience to study her own defiant expression in the mirror. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She hits a SPEED-DIAL button, we hear a phone RINGING as she PEELS off the CAT MASK -- and a WIG... it's LAUREL AVENAL. We hear XAVIER'S VOICE: 
XAVIER (V.O.) (FILTER) 
Are we on? 
LAUREL 
Oh honey, we are so on. 
INT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
CHAOS, PARAMEDICS, COPS, a FORENSICS TEAM photographing George's corpse. Nearby, other COPS bag the HANDGUN. TOM LONE is here, on his cell phone, heading for the exit. 
LONE 
(on phone) Yeah, we got a couple dozen witnesses, it was Catwoman. Looks like it might be the same weapon that killed Nevski... 
EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
LONE moves outside, past FILM TRUCKS outside this urban church, still on the phone. 
LONE 
(on phone) Nah, couldn't have been Price after all, musta been a lab error. You better cut her loose right away or she's gonna have a hell of a lawsuit on her hands... yeah, be there soon, I just gotta tie up a couple loose ends. He climbs in his sedan and moves off. 
EXT. AVENAL HQ - NIGHT 
LONE'S SEDAN pulls up near the entrance to the office tower. As he gets out, he hears a CHOPPER coming in overhead and looks up to see -- The AVENAL BEAUTY sign high above, a TWIN-ROTOR CHOPPER approaching the helipad. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LONE moves toward the showroom entrance, tries the door -- locked. He sees the entrance to the PARKING GARAGE, moves down the ramp. 
EXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - NIGHT 
THE MILITARY CARGO CHOPPER touches down. XAVIER and FOUR MERCENARIES emerge. Two mercs carry ALUMINUM SUITCASES, all are armed with AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. In addition to chopper SOUNDS, there's a WHISTLING WIND up here and the WHITE NOISE ROAR of A.C. DUCTS. LAUREL, still in the cat suit but without the mask, is waiting. XAVIER approaches, a small BRIEFCASE in hand. Laurel's manner is cold, professional, all business -- she couldn't be more different from the victimized female we met up here at the outset. 
XAVIER 
Your husband? 
LAUREL 
He won't be a problem.    Ever again.   And I'm not even a suspect. She gestures to her outfit.       Xavier nods. 
XAVIER 
American women. I'm always impressed. 
LAUREL 
Let's do some business. They head down the stairs. CAMERA MOVES, off the roof, to the roof of an adjacent, lower SKYSCRAPER -- and finds -- 
EXT. SKYSCRAPER ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
THE REAL CATWOMAN. She paces, breathing hard, steeling herself for something, looking toward the Avenal building. A WINDOW WASHER RIG hangs halfway down the building, but it's quite a distance from this roof edge. 
CATWOMAN 
I can do this... right? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She's addressing MIDNIGHT, who non-commitally licks a paw. CATWOMAN moves to the far end of the roof and sprints toward the edge, leaps for all she's worth -- CATWOMAN sails through the air in a perfect arc, toward the window-washer rig... but she's going to fall short and plunge twenty stories. At the last second, she pulls out her whip and snaps it out around -- -- the cables of the rig. CATWOMAN SLAMS HARD against the side of the building, dangling from the whip. 
CATWOMAN 
Ow. She struggles to pull herself upward. 
INT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE - NIGHT 
An ALUMINUM SUITCASE opens -- STACKS of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. WIDER, WESLEY handles the suitcase. He starts to count the stacks of money, testing random bills with a COUNTERFEIT PEN. Meanwhile, Xavier's MERCS are moving aside the LADDERS and PAINT CANS. One yanks down the frilly DRAPERIES to reveal -- CANISTERS OF YP-3, dozens of them in a cutout portion of wall, more than we've seen before. Laurel's been hiding them here all along. Xavier opens his briefcase -- there's a TESTING KIT inside. 
XAVIER 
May I? 
So saying, XAVIER plucks a WHITE ROSE from an arrangement. He seals it into a clear PLASTIC CONTAINER, moves to a random canister, and attaches a NOZZLE tightly to the VALVE. Cautiously, he releases a small amount of PRESSURIZED LIQUID into the container. CLOSE -- as the MIST makes contact with the ROSE, the PETALS turn PINK, then RED BLOTCHES appear. Abruptly, the petals BLACKEN, WITHER and ULCERATE. The flower is a shriveled mess in seconds. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
XAVIER 
Nice. XAVIER carefully removes the nozzle, nodding appreciatively at the canisters. 
XAVIER 
Avenal should think about getting out of cosmetics altogether -- chemical weapons are a growth industry. THE MERCS, with slightly nervous looks, begin carefully moving the canisters out of the penthouse, up the stairs to the helicopter. THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN -- it's ANGEL. 
ANGEL 
Look what I found. He lifts the semi-conscious LONE from the floor -- the man's been bound, gagged and blindfolded with DUCT TAPE, there's a bruise on his head. ANGEL flashes LONE'S BADGE. 
EXT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE GARDEN - NIGHT 
WESLEY and ANGEL have emerged from the penthouse, alarmed, just as LAUREL and XAVIER nearly trip over the groaning 
MERCENARY #2. 
XAVIER 
What the hell --? Xavier takes the man's AUTOMATIC WEAPON, he and Laurel hurry up to the helipad. 
EXT. AVENAL HQ - HELIPAD - NIGHT 
LAUREL and XAVIER reach the top of the stairs, followed by WESLEY and ANGEL, just as -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CATWOMAN leaps down to the penthouse level from the helipad. The group is stunned to see the injured men. MERCENARY #1 is crawling out from behind the A.C. DUCT. LAUREL angrily grabs a MACHINE GUN from the dazed MERCENARY #3. To Xavier: 
LAUREL 
Where did you find these clowns?! MERCENARY #4 and ANGEL scout the helipad's perimeter, guns at the ready. WESLEY nervously backs toward the stairs. 
WESLEY 
If it's all right with you, Laurel, I'd just as soon be going... Xavier is looking around frantically. 
XAVIER 
These are good soldiers.    It would take a team of men -- 
LAUREL 
(realizing) Or one woman. 
CATWOMAN (O.S.) 
Look what I found! All spin to see -- CATWOMAN standing at the edge of the helipad, above the sheer drop, holding THE TWO SUITCASES out to either side of her. She has a lit CIGAR clenched between her teeth. Behind her, the SKY is LIGHTENING with approaching dawn. ALL GUNS are trained on Catwoman, except Laurel's. 
LAUREL 
Don't shoot, you idiots!    She'll drop the money-- They don't lower their guns.        Catwoman narrows her eyes, speaks around the cigar. 
CATWOMAN 
Henchmen, Laurel? How tacky. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She jerks one of the cases -- the latch has been loosened, it POPS OPEN and CASH GOES FLYING into the wind -- DRIFTING from the rooftop to the city streets below. LAUREL reacts in agony. 
LAUREL 
No, please-- don't do that again! CATWOMAN drops the emptied case and pulls the cigar from her mouth with a distasteful expression. Eying Laurel: 
CATWOMAN 
Don't you hate it when somebody shows up at a party wearing the same dress? LAUREL advances on Catwoman. 
LAUREL 
Let's face it -- we're alike, you and me. Catwoman ignores her, shouts to XAVIER and his men: 
CATWOMAN 
You guys gotta be careful with this YP-3 stuff. It's a living thing, you know, a bacteria. If it gets too hot -- it dies. XAVIER looks from Catwoman to the FUEL pooling on the helipad, putting two and two together. He jerks his head at his mercs -- they start backing away toward the stairs. LAUREL is still focused on the money. 
LAUREL 
Let's split the rest of the money -- and there's more where that came from -- 
CATWOMAN 
Tempting offer... We would make a pretty good team. Beyond the law, fighting the yoke of male oppression, sisters under the skin... LAUREL nods hopefully.     CATWOMAN looks thoughtfully at the cigar in her hand. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CATWOMAN 
Nah, I still have to live with myself. So saying, she flicks the LIT CIGAR to the helipad -- IGNITING the spreading pool of gasoline -- XAVIER ET AL. sprint to LEAP OFF THE HELIPAD or CHARGE DOWN THE STAIRS as -- THE HELICOPTER EXPLODES in a glorious FIREBALL. LAUREL is thrown across the helipad by the BLAST, showered with CHOPPER DEBRIS. The men are hightailing it out of there, but Laurel gets slowly to her feet, machine gun ready, bent on revenge. Spotting CATWOMAN darting through the SMOKE and FLAMES toward the stairs, LAUREL FIRES a volley with a SCREAM of rage and charges after her in pursuit. 
EXT. AVENAL HQ - PENTHOUSE GARDEN - DAWN 
LAUREL hurries down the stairs to the garden, FIRING at -- CATWOMAN, as she darts into the penthouse.         Catwoman's nearly hit, showered with broken glass. 
INT. AVENAL HQ - LAUREL'S PENTHOUSE - DAWN 
The roof CREAKS ominously, the room is thick with SMOKE. LAUREL charges in, sees movement near THE ELEVATOR and FIRES 
A BODY goes down with a CRY.          LAUREL laughs triumphantly, moves to find -- ANGEL, dead on the floor.       LAUREL winces. 
LAUREL 
Sorry, Angel. CATWOMAN leaps at Laurel from behind, the GUN goes flying. The two women CRASH into the CLASSICAL SCULPTURES, shattering them in the course of their struggle. Laurel keeps going for the gun, but Catwoman won't let her get near it. 
INT. AVENAL HQ - SHOWROOM - DAWN 
WESLEY, XAVIER and his MERCS hurry from the elevators. They've almost made it out the exit to safety when an EERIE HOWL erupts -- 
LAUREL 
No!   My face! PATIENCE/CATWOMAN knocks her to the ground, straddles her. The fight's gone out of LAUREL now, she clutches at her disfigured features. Patience/Catwoman cocks her head, looking at the shredded LATEX hanging from her claws. 
PATIENCE/CATWOMAN 
So I'm not the only one hiding behind a mask. 
LAUREL 
I was the first to try Beaunique -- I was over 30, I had nothing to lose. When the symptoms started to show, it was too late... As she speaks, Laurel peels away the remains of the LATEX. 
PATIENCE/CATWOMAN 
So you upped production and sold the stuff to an arms dealer. 
LAUREL 
Life hands you lemons, you make lemonade. 
A FLAMING BEAM gives way, blocking the STAIRWELL, part of the CEILING collapses -- this gives Laurel the chance to squirm out from under PATIENCE/CATWOMAN. But instead of going for the gun, she runs straight for the make-up mirror. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
PATIENCE/CATWOMAN runs to Lone's side, pulling him away from the spreading flames toward the ELEVATOR. She SLASHES the tape that binds his wrists. LAUREL, meanwhile, opens a hidden COMPARTMENT by her mirror, revealing numerous LATEX MASKS. She begins to apply a new one, using adhesive, smoothing wrinkles, hiding the seams, etc. Nearby, her PORTRAIT starts to MELT and turn to ASH. THE CEILING BUCKLES, chunks of MASONRY falling. PATIENCE/CATWOMAN is prying open the elevator doors. 
PATIENCE/CATWOMAN 
Laurel, you better get out of here -- 
LAUREL 
In a minute -- I have to finish putting on my face 
THE DOORS OPEN on the empty shaft -- almost as an afterthought, PATIENCE/CATWOMAN snatches up her MASK, pulling LONE to her with her other arm. THE CEILING gives way with a BURST OF FLAME -- 
INT. AVENAL HQ - ELEVATOR SHAFT - DAY 
PATIENCE/CATWOMAN leaps into the open elevator shaft, LONE has his arms around her -- together they slide down a CABLE as FLAMES ERUPT from above. 
INT. AVENAL HQ - LAUREL'S PENTHOUSE - DAY 
LAUREL is now trapped in the make-up alcove, illuminated by flames surrounding her, but she doesn't seem to care, working frantically to get a new face on. She whispers a mantra: 
LAUREL 
You're still beautiful... you'll always be beautiful... CRASH! CHUNKS OF HELIPAD and the remains of the FLAMING CHOPPER come through the ceiling, obliterating Laurel. 
EXT. AVENAL HQ - DAY 
POLICE charge into the building from a number of COP CARS. As they do so, we see the ARMY OF CATS fleeing. 
INT. AVENAL HQ - SHOWROOM - DAY 
WESLEY, XAVIER and the MERCS are on the ground, SCRATCHED and BLEEDING. They raise their hands for the puzzled, gun- wielding COPS. 
WESLEY 
Thank God you're here... 
INT. AVENAL HQ - PARKING GARAGE - DAY 
ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN in this parking garage. PATIENCE/ CATWOMAN pulls LONE out, he seems woozy, his arms around her neck. They collapse together against a wall. She tears the DUCT TAPE off Lone's mouth.   He winces. 
LONE 
Who are you? PATIENCE/CATWOMAN hesitates, about to answer -- but instead gives him a long kiss. Then she darts OUT OF FRAME. LONE reels from the kiss, then collects himself and pulls the duct tape from his eyes. WIDE SHOT -- he's alone, no sign of her. 
EXT. AVENAL HQ - DAY 
OVERHEAD ANGLE as COPS hustle XAVIER and the OTHERS into police vehicles. CAMERA KEEPS PULLING UP, until we see the ruined ROOF of the building, IN FLAMES. The "A" in "AVENAL BEAUTY" has been knocked out by the conflagration ... for a few moments the sign reads "VENAL BEAUTY," until the whole thing EXPLODES and SPARKS OUT. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. EDNA'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
EDNA lies on the couch, a hand over her eyes, asleep in a robe. She stirs as a TONGUE laps at her face. As she sits up, dozens of CATS are all over her, begging for attention. She laughs and cries at the same time then sees -- CATWOMAN, masked again, who has entered behind the cats. 
EDNA 
Thank you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CATWOMAN 
A promise is a promise. Her tone is soft, more like Patience's.       EDNA takes in the blood on her, her torn clothes. 
EDNA 
What happened to you? 
CATWOMAN 
I found out the truth. Edna notes the SUNLIGHT pouring through the window, eyes her. 
EDNA 
But the sun is up... you're still Catwoman? CATWOMAN pulls off the mask and looks at it, puzzled.

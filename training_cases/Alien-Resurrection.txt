Alien Resurrection 
EXT.  DEEP SPACE SILENT BLACK. 
We sweep slowly across an endless tapestry of stars. Finally she comes into view: 
the U.S.S. AURIGA. A massive research vessel that sits majestically just beyond Pluto's orbit. 
We TRACK ALONG the side of the ship, and 
INT.  AURIGA 
along the silent, empty corridors, coming at last to a door with two guards standing rigid in front of it. Full armour, powerful shockrifles, expressions empty and cold. 
INT.  MEDLAB 
Along a row of screens, where we see the first signs of life readouts, lights, data -- all shifting and collating on the blinking screens. 
As we move ALONG them, a figure-in a labcoat passes through the frame, then another,leading us along the lab to settle on what looks like a Cryogenic tube, not big enough for a human. 
Still TRACKING around it, we glimpse inside some vague, fetal mass encased in a clear, aspic-like gel. 
Tubes and cables a attached to the mass, running out of the machine. 
As we still CIRCLE, the shape begins to be more coherent, till we can see what might even be a face. 
Eyes, shut tight.  Sleeping. Dreaming. 
ANGLE: WHEAT. 
A birds eyes view of a field, the soft golden waves filling the screen. Sharp contrast to what we have seen before. 
There is a woman wandering through the field.  Beside her a girl, seven or eight, in dingey sundress.  Both have black, tousled hair. 
GIRL'S VOICE 
My mom always said there were no monsters -- no, real ones -- but there are. 
The girl stops, looks around her.  The wheat comes all the up to her chest, and nothing  else is visible as far as she see. 
She looks back at the woman but the woman is already more than fifty yards away. 
The girl's expression becomes perplexed. 
She slaps a bug on the back of her neck.  Pulls it off and is HUGE, wriggling fleshily in  her hand.  Her expression becomes even more distraught, but she cannot muster forth a shout. 
The sound of insects-fills the air.  Another bug lands on her, another. She looks down in  growing horror and sees: 
Blood.  At her feet, rising, filling the field, rising above the wheat, a sea of blood now, dark, thick. 
The girl tries again to scream, raises her arms.  She is completely covered in insects, a skittering black shroud of them, and when she finally does SCREAM they flood into her mouth. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LAB 
Instruments show a jolt in heart rate, blood pressure. 
Scientists note it down, look over at the thing in aspic. 
We can tell that time has passed because it is much bigger, nearly the size of a man, and in a new case. 
The camera moves in on the cardiograph, then moves down, to show a second one. Tracking a smaller, much faster heartbeat. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLLWAY 
Tiny. dark, and we are moving through it at impossible speed turning into another without slowing, up into an air vent, still moving, moving until we reach a chamber, some place where all we can see is a mass of dark, moving, inhuman fle it welcomes us in, envelops us... 
ANGLE: RIPLEY  Lying somewhere, maybe the dark-chamber -- in the dream it keeps shifting. 
She opens her eyes, but they are dark, whiteless. 
She reaches for her chest and begins scratching . Hard. 
Tearing at it, as blood wells up, spilling over her sides. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  OPERATING CHAMBER 
And the cause of this dream becomes apparant: 
ANGLE: RIPLEY'S CHEST 
being cut open with a lasersaw. 
We see her body still has a layer of the aspic-slime clinging to it. And her skin is unnaturally blue. But as we PAN from her chest to her face her identity is unmistakable. 
Around her are several men in operating masks.  Cutting her GEDIMAN, a young and enthusiastic scientist.  One man, seemingly in charge, stands a bit off, watching.  This, by tag on his coat, is DR WREN. 
WREN 
Careful ... ready with the amnio... 
Gediman finishes cutting.  Another man steps in with a clamp. Sets it. Pulls apart the chest. 
GEDIMAN 
There she is... 
He says it like he's found a lost kitten.  He reaches in an pulls out a sleeping, fetal but nearly ready to burst ALIEN. Others work at severing umbilical threads that tie it to Ripley's chest. 
GEDIMAN 
Here we go. 
He holds it up and others step in with the amnio, a sort of incubator filled with  amniotic fluid. 
The alien SCREAMS, its tiny mouth full with teeth, and wriggles out of his grasp. 
WREN 
Watch it! 
Everybody panics -- but before the thing can get completely away from him, Gediman grabs it and sticks it in the amnio.  Someone shuts the top rapidly. 
Everybody looks at each other for a moment. 
GEDIMAN 
Well ... 
WREN 
The host? 
A surgeon looks at Ripley's readings. 
SURGEON 
Doing fine. 
Gediman looks at Wren, hopefully.  Wren nods. 
WREN 
Sew her back up. 
Gediman and the surgeon get to work, as the others carefully remove the alien. 
GEDIMAN 
WREN 
There are gaps. And there's some degree of cognitive dissonance. 
GEDIMAN 
She's freaked. 
Wren shoots Gediman a stern look at his unscientific parlance. 
WREN 
"It" has some connective difficulties. A kind of low level emotional autism. 
Certain reactions.... 
Perez looks at Ripley through the glass, then exits into the hall. 
TO: 
INT HALL - CONTINUOUS 
The two scientists follow, pace him as he strides down towards a second observation room. 
GEDIMAN: 
But the thing is, we can't terminate her. It. 
PEREZ 
You haven't told me what you think has caused this. 
Cloned genes don't contain memory cells, not even when they're brought to adult term.  I'm right? 
GEDIMAN 
There's been cases.. 
PEREZ 
Not like this. 
WREN 
Well, we don't have nearly enough data... but in some cases there is a collective memory passed down generationally. At a genetic level. Like instinct, only  more complex structurally. 
PEREZ 
In some cases. You're talking about the alien. 
WREN 
Yes. 
PEREZ 
You promised me there wasn't going to be any crossing. 
WREN 
It's not like the other ones.. 
Perez punches code, puts his hand on the scanner and the second observation room door opens.. 
He steps in, the other two right behind him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM TWO 
Darker than the first one, and with two of the heavily armoured guards by the door. 
Apart from-that, identical.  Perez turns to the others. 
PEREZ 
But there is some genetic mix. 
WREN 
Yes. 
PEREZ 
Will there be further mutation? 
GEDIMAN 
Mutation isn't exactly... I don't think so. 
WREN 
That's one of the things we need to study. 
PEREZ 
All right. You can keep it. But secure, under obsorvation, and for God's sake keep it away from here.  I don't want any more surprises. 
And as he speaks the ALIEN RISES RIGHT BEHIND HIM -- it's big, the ridges on its head indicating a young queen -- it hisses and LUNGES at the back of his head. 
The reinforced plastic window between them, which we couldn't see, stops it. 
As it hits, a thin laser grid buzzes to life, sparks crackling on the alien's face. 
Its bile trails darkly on the glass as it backs off. 
Perez turns to look at it with the others. 
PEREZ 
It took a hell of a lot to get us here. 
GEDIMAN 
No shit. 
Wren shoots him another look. 
PEREZ 
How soon before this one's ovulating? 
WREN 
Days. 
PEREZ 
Is that normal? 
WREN 
No way of knowing for sure, but I'd say it's accelerated. 
(After a moment) We're going to need the supplies. 
PEREZ 
They're coming.  Soon. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MESS HALL 
I guarantee that boy's. Never seen the inside of a woman. 
(to Hillard) 
Bring us in on three-oh descent, ride the parallel. 
HILLARD 
Darlin', it's done. 
ELGYN 
Don't cut thrust till six hundred meters. Give em a little fright. 
He puts his hand on her shoulder, runs it up along her cheek as he exits. 
They're more than friends. 
He moves through a hallway, sticks his head in a cubicle. 
ELGYN 
Christie!  St Just!  Rise and shine. We're docking. 
He proceeds into: 
INT.  CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS 
It's the largest space in this boat, two stories high. Taking up most of the space are two HARVESTERS, big rusty hovering threshers roughly the size of winnebagos. 
As Elgyn enters, we CRANE UP to reveal ANNALEE-CALL working atop one of them. 
She's young, tough -- at home with this  motley bunch despite her youth and prettiness. 
ELGYN 
Call!  CALL! 
The music is louder here -- it's blasting from a box in the corner. 
Elgyn switches it off. 
ELGYN 
Call! 
CALL 
What? 
ELGYN 
We're docking! Are the cargo trucks secured? 
CALL 
I checked 'em an hour ago. 
ELGYN 
I don't want em so much as rattled. Any leakage, I take it out of your hide. 
CALL 
Trust me, boss. 
ELGYN (laughs) 
Not my style. 
He leans down, looks under the thresher.  Lying on a gurneylike steel dolly, working under the machine, is VRIESS, chie mechanic.  Late forties, in pretty good shape considering he's got no legs. 
ELGYN 
How's it looking? 
VRIESS  It's never gonna be pretty. but she'll fly.  The other one's a total fucking write-off. 
ELGYN 
You'll make it good. 
VRIESS 
Don't be so sure. 
(calls out) Call!  Adjust the generator plugs! 
ELGYN (straightening up) 
They just gotta run, Vriess.  They don't gotta run far. 
He exits. 
CUT TO: INT. HALL   CONTINTJOUS 
CHRISTIE is up and mostly dressed. He is black, very large, and has distinctly military bearing. He speaks with quiet, don't-fuck-with-me authority. 
CHRISTIE 
What's our status? 
ELGYN 
We're coming in.  Time to enjoy a little of the general's hospitality. 
ST JUST 
Oh great.  Army food.. 
ST JUST ("San-Jhoost") is slim, Asian -- and the epitome of cool. 
Moves quickly and silently, a sly grin playing about lips.  He is strapping a contraption to his forearm.  It resembles a deringer holder, but a very complex one. 
ELGYN: We could use a rest, till the heat's off and Vriess can get those harvesters on their feet. 
This'll keep us for a couple of days, assuming the natives are friendly. 
CHRISTIE 
We expecting any trouble? 
ELGYN 
From Perez? I doubt it. Still, let's be ever vigilant. 
CUT TO: INT.  CARGO BAY     CONTNIUOUS 
ANGLE: VRIESS working intently, the extremely nasty blades of the thresher inches above his head. 
VRIESS 
I'm patched in. Check the sequence timer. 
(no answer) 
Call? 
ANGLE: THE CONTROLS 
A hand reaches in toward the ON switch. 
ANGLE: VRIESS 
JOHNER: That ain't what I'm hungry for. 
VRIESS (to Call) 
What's the matter? 
She is looking around her, somewhat tensely. 
CALL 
I don't like army. 
HILLARD 
Yeah, join the fucking club. 
CUT TO: ANGLE: MONEY 
A stack of bills dropped down on a desk, then another.  They're green, and identifiably money. But they're square, about the size of cocktail napkins.  The face on them is  unfamiliar.  Thousand dollar bills. 
WIDER ANGLE: INT.  PEREZIS CHAMBERS    LATER 
A good sized suite, decorated in a sparse, military fashion. Perez is behind his desk, the money sitting between him and Elgyn. 
PEREZ 
This wasn't easy to come by. 
ELGYN 
Neither was our cargo. You're not pleading poverty, are you? 
PEREZ 
We're well funded. I mean the bills. There's not many that still deal in coin. 
ELGYN 
Just the ones that don't like their every transaction recorded. The fringe element. 
I guess that would include you, though, wouldn't it? 
PEREZ 
Drink? 
ELGYN 
Constantly.  I'm guessing whatever you've got going here wasn't exactly approved by congress. 
Perez pours two whiskeys. 
PEREZ (changing the subject) 
So where do you go from here? 
ELGYN 
Out by the Handle.  We've got a couple of harvesters, we can unload 'em on one of the collectives if Vriess and Call get 'em working. 
PEREZ 
Call.  Where'd you find her? 
ELGYN 
She is severely fuckable, isn't she? - And the very devil with a socket wrench. 
I think Vriess somewhat pines. 
He takes a stack of bill, smells it.  He likes the smell.- 
ELGYN 
She is curious about this little transaction.  You can hardly blame her, Awfully cloak and  dagger... 
Perez hands a drink to ELGYN. 
PEREZ 
This is an army operation. 
ELGYN 
Most army research labs don't have to operate outside regulated space. 
And they don't call for the kind of cargo we brought. 
PEREZ 
Do you want something, Elgyn? 
ELGYN 
Just bed and board, couple of days worth.  If we're not imposing. 
PEREZ 
Not at all. Keep out of the restricted areas, don't start any fights, and mi casa is yours too. 
Elgyn drinks to that. 
PEREZ 
I trust, of course, that you can mind your own business. 
ELGYN (smiles) 
I'm famous for it. 
They drink. 
CUT TO: INT. HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA 
The 'cargo' is rolled down the corridor, armed guards flank it. It is wheeled into: 
INT.  A CHAMBER 
Where Wren and a few others are waiting.  Gediman looks a little nervous, not sure this is a good idea. 
The cargo is locked into place on the floor and and a guard works the electric lock. 
It springs open and the guard slides off a side panel. 
They are stacked one on the other, five of them in all, cryotubes. People sleeping inside. 
One by one the tubes are hauled to one side of the room as the second unit is wheeled in. 
By the end there are ten people sleeping side by side in their tubes in the dark chamber. 
The scientists meanwhile retire to INT.  AN ADJOINING CHAMBER with a long glass window looking at the chamber. 
The last of the guards leaves the chamber and we see the door lock behind them. 
Wren starts pushing buttons. 
The glass tops of the cryotubes slide open.  We see temperature and lifesign gauges begin to change.. 
There is a thick whirring as a part of the ceiling above the tubes lowers, lowers,  and rotates slowly. 
Stuck to the other side of it are ten alien eggs.  The ceiling rotates just enough so that they are aimed at the heads of the sleepers. 
For a moment nothing happens. 
VRIESS, rolling about the Aurigals engine room, looking it over. 
Christie, St Just, Call and Johner, all playing poker in the mess hall. 
CUT TO:  INT.  OBSERVATION ROOM - RIGHT 
A sleep cycle is indicated here by the low lighting and the near emptiness of the room. 
Gediman alone is in here, writing observations down in a notebook as he watches the pen. 
Inside are three aliens. Two of them seem to be hibernating, curled up in the corner,  but the third faces the glass, tilting its head and hissing at it. 
Gediman sits right up close to it, his face just inches away from the beast's.  It draws back its lips, opens its mouth.  The metallic tongue issues slowly forth, dripping with slime. 
GEDIMAN (softly, fascinated) 
Is that a distended externus lingua ... or are you just happy to see me? 
The creature hisses. retracts the tongue. Gediman scribbles few notes. 
Something moves in the dark behind him. Before he can notice, a hand closes on his shoulder. 
It's Ripley. She steps forward, eyes locked on the cage. Gediman seems only mildly surprised. 
GEDIMAN 
How did you get in here? 
RIPLEY 
Beautiful, aren't they? 
GEDIMAN 
Yes.  Yes they are.  I've been monitoring their interaction. 
He points at a audiograph by the wall, blips and waves interrupting the vibrating line, indicating sound. 
He notices that her hand is still on her shoulder. 
GEDIMAN 
They communicate.  Through ultrasonic soundwaves.  Sort of like bats. 
RIPLEY 
I know. 
She looks at him. 
RIPLEY 
I can hear them. 
GEDIMAN (smiling) 
Amazing ... 
She runs her hand through the back of his hair, gently urging him up off his chair. 
GEDIMAN 
Ripley... 
RIPLEY 
Shhhhh. 
She pulls him close, kisses him.  Lightly at first, then deeply - holding his head with both hands. He responds with surprising warmth, the kiss drawing out, pulling slowly apart. 
She looks at him, smiles. 
An alien tongue SHOOTS out of her mouth, burying itself in his face. 
SMASH CUT TO: INT.  RIPLEY'S CHAMBER 
As she suddenly awakes, eyes wide, breathing hard. 
She has been sleeping, we see, in the same position she was before: squatting in the middle of the room. She looks about her, recovering from the nightmare... Her breathing slows. With a somewhat fatalistic look, she settles back to sleep. 
CUT TO: INTERIOR MESS HALL - NIGHT 
Christie, Call, St Just and Johner are still at their all night poker game, stacks of bills, peanuts and liquor scattered the table. 
They are in a tense hand, the pot impressively high. 
JOHNER 
I'm in. 
CHRISTIE 
All right. 
ST JUST 
Raise you two hundred. 
JOHNER 
Oh, fuck you! 
CALL 
That's it. I'm out. I'm fucked. 
She throws down her cards, takes a swig of Johner's patented moonshine. It tastes horrible. 
CHRISTIE 
That takes me down, too. Johner? 
JOHNER 
Uh, Uh, fuck it. I fold. 
(to St Just) 
What do-you got? 
St Just calmly shuffles his cards back into the deck. 
ST JUST 
You'll always wonder. 
JOHNER 
You asshole. 
CHRISTIE 
Johner, your deal. 
CALL 
Deal me out. It's not my night. 
She tries to stand up, takes a spill over her chair.  The others laugh. 
CALL 
Jesus, Johner, what do you put in that shit, battery acid? 
RIPLEY 
It's in my head.  Behind my eyes.  I can hear it moving.  The beast. 
The smile is gone, some real vulnerability showing through.  Call softens, trying a different tack. 
CALL 
Help me.  If there's anything human in you at all, help me stop them before  this thing gets loose. 
RIPLEY 
It's already loose. 
Call's expression changes.  Those words terrify her, but she's not sure if Ripley means what she thinks. 
Ripley raises her hand at Call's head -- Call flinches but Ripley stops a few inches away. 
Then touches her forehead gently, almost sensually. 
RIPLEY 
Once the thought .... the hope for it ... grows here.... it has found its way. 
It will come, because... man will bring it.  Bring it forth. 
CALL 
You want that. 
RIPLEY 
I've come to terms with the fact of it. It's inevitable. 
CALL 
Not so long as there's breath-in me. 
Ripley LASHES OUT and GRABS CALL'S THROAT.  Call swings wit the blade but Ripley has her arm pinned before she can connect.  Ripley squeezes the girls neck. 
Ripley looks at the girl with a world of sadness. 
RIPLEY 
I can... make it ... stop... 
Call's eyes are pleading, terrified. Ripley finally lets go and she drops to the ground gasping for air.  RIPLEY 
Go. They're coming for you. 
As soon as she can move, Call scrambles up and heads out. 
CUT TO: INT.  HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Call comes out and before she can move a RIFLE BUT hits her the head. She goes down but  not out as two guards grab her. Wren is with them and three more. 
WREN 
I think you're gonna find that this was ill advised. 
(to the men) Where are her friends? 
GUARD 
Mess hall, most of them. 
WREN 
Sound the alarm. I want them rounded up. Now! 
TO: INT.  MESS HALL - MOMENTS LATER 
ANGLE: THE CARD TABLE 
Being kicked over. 
Elgyn, Hillard and Rane are pushed into the room, sleepy and confused. 
Christie, St Just, and Johner are all being herded in by soldiers. 
Call is thrown into the group as well. 
ELGYN 
What the fuck is going on here? 
CHRISTIE 
Looks like a doublecross, boss. 
WREN 
Where's the other one? With the chair? 
JOHNER (to a soldier) 
Get your fucking hands off me! 
ELGYN 
Do you mind telling me what the fuck you're up to? 
WREN 
Shut up! 
(to a guard) Get the general.  Wake him up. 
ELGYN 
Look, if there's a problem tell me what it is. We can work this out, there is no  need to get emotional ... 
St Just is silent, standing in the same position he was when Ripley attacked Johner. 
Hands behind his back. 
ANGLE: BEHIND ST JUST'S BACK 
As Elgyn speaks, two guns..slip out of his sleeves and fill his hands. 
CALL 
They got nothing to do with this, Wren. 
ELGYN (to Call) 
To do with what? 
WREN  I don't give a fuck. It's way too late for that. You're all looking at a firing squad. 
You hear me? 
ELGYN 
I do.  St Just? 
With lighting precision, St Just raises his hands and blows of the guards away. 
He takes out a third to his left without even looking that way. 
One guard gets off a shot with his burner, frying Rane before Hillard's elbow knocks his teeth well into his throat. 
Christie tackles the next as Johner presses a latch on the bottom of his thermos --  the top half flies off, revealing handle of a gun inside. He grabs it and another  guard runs. Johner doesn't have time to pull the gun-out of the the so he SHOOTS right through it, sending the guard flying.. 
He punches up a different sector. The labs, and here is a badly wounded lieutenant. 
PEREZ 
Status! 
LIEUTENANT 
Containment is impossible, sir... I think they swept the barracks. 
PEREZ (to himself) 
A military strike.... Christ Jesus ... 
After a beat, he starts punching in the emergency override codes. 
CUT TO: INT.  BARRACKS - CONTINUOUS 
It's worst here -- the aliens have taken out a dozen men in their sleep, and everyone awake is screaming.  One soldier runs for the weapons cabinet -- an alien hits him from behind and SMASHES him into it, falling in a tumble of guns. 
Over the chaos, the emergency lighting comes on, floor light like an airplane's indicating the nearest exit.  Father's voice is excruciatingly calm: 
FATHER 
Emergency. Initiate evacuation procedures immediately. All hands. This is not a drill. 
One soldier gets a bead on an alien with his burner - fries italong with two of his friends. 
They're out of commission, but the alien is hurt only momentarily.  It bounds forward, takes out his face. 
FATHER 
Emergency.  Initiate evacuation procedures ... 
CUT TO.. 
INT. HALLWAY BY ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The noise is too far above to be heard down here, but Fathers droning voice and the emergency lighting are on. 
Vriess wheels slowly into the hall, concerned.  He spins slowly, checking out his surroundings. 
ANGLE: DOWN THE HALL 
There is nothing.. Just the floor lights pulsing in succession towards the exit. 
Vriess follows their lead, wheeling out. 
CUT TO: INT.  NEXT HALL - CONTINUOUS 
Nothing here either. But Vriess's fur is up -- he moves slowly, carefully. 
And was that a noise?  He looks around, up at the ceiling. 
A drop of alien blood is eating through right above him.  It drips down -- and he rolls out of the way just in time, back up as the blood plops to the floor, eating casually through. 
CUT TO: INT.  LIFEBOAT BAY ONE - CONTINUOUS 
Men are rushing into one of the lifeboats.  They sit facing each other in the tiny vessel  and strap themselves in.  Pere is here, hurrying the soldiers in, pushing back the few who try to crowd in after. 
PEREZ 
Bay three!  Go! 
The late soldiers make for the next boat as Perez seals the hatch.  He hits the eject button and steps back. 
CUT TO: EXT.  THE AURIGA - CONTINUOUS 
As the lifeboat FIRES out of the side of the giant craft. 
CUT TO: INT.  BAY THREE - CONTINUOUS 
Men crowd into this one too -- it's nearly full and an alien suddenly LEAPS into it.. starts feeding on the men strapped down - they are screaming. 
Perez runs in as a soldier outside the lifeboat fires his burner, hitting the alien, the men, the controls -- a shower of sparks as the alien-turns, about to spring on the soldier as he rolls in a grenade. The doors shut and and a soldier hits the eject button. 
TO: EXT.  AURIGA - CONTINUOUS 
The second lifeboat comes shooting out and moments later.  EXPLODES. 
CUT TO: INT.  MESS HALL - CONTINUOUS 
The noise of the explosion - and of a few inside as well - is all around the group. 
Father's voice still urges evacuaticion 
WREN 
NO! 
(to Call) 
What have you done? 
CALL 
Nothing.  Not a goddanm thing. You thought you could control it. 
ELGYN 
All right. We make for the Betty. Can he walk? 
He is pointing at Rane, who nods, standing. 
HILLARD  Betty's all the way across the ship! Who knows what's in between? 
CALL (indicating Wren) 
He does. 
One of the soldiers steps forward.  DiStephano. 
DISTEPHANO (to Wren) 
Sir, we have to go. 
(to Elgyn) Let him go.  No quarrel. 
ELGYN 
You can have him when we're off. Not before. 
They start out, dragging Wren along.  Guns still on Call and the soldiers. 
What about Vriess? 
JOHNER 
Fuck Vriess! 
CUT TO INT.  FALL - CONTINUOUS 
Vries enters, looking around.  He is getting seriously wigged. 
The lights on the floor still pulse. Urging him forward.  He obeys. 
Something stirs in the rafters.  Coiled about the pipes. 
Vriess stops, still a good thirty feet from the beast.  Strains to see. 
It starts MOVING, climbing at him upside down on the pipes.  FAST. 
Vriess starts wheeling himself back away but SLOWLY, agonizingly slowly compared to the beast. 
INT.  CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 
that leads to the holding cells.  The room is big, a railing at one end looking over another chamber two flights down. 
A shut door separates the chamber from the cells. 
ELGYN 
Can you get that one open? 
It comes from the rafters, dropping down on Elgyn in a heartbeat.  He barely has time to scream before it shoots its tongue through the back of his skull. 
Hillard has time.  She SCREAMS as her lover's brains come out his mouth. 
The beast leaps at the group, scattering them like bowling pins as it claws into one of the guards. Everybody else is scrambling for cover. 
St Just tries to escape by running past the beast - its tail lashes out, tangling his feet and tripping him up, his head smashing against a pipe. 
Another guard hits it with the burner -- it shrieks and lands on him. Johner shoots at it but is far too panicked to hit it. 
Call has backed to the far wall -- she desperately works the controls to open the door. 
It starts to rise. 
CALL 
Christie!  Hillard!  Come on! 
The door rises fully.  Ripley stands behind it. 
Call starts back, not sure what the woman will do. 
Ripley surveys the scene. 
The Alien, burrowing its head into the belly of the guard, stops. Looks up. 
Everyone watches as the two creatures sense each other.  ThE alien hisses. rears back. 
Ripley looks away, contemplative We see a gamut of emotions cross her face, but her posture passive, sacrificial.  She does not move. 
Everyone watches, too afraid to breathe. 
The alien LUNGES at her, leaping across the room in two bounds. It's on her -- and she SPINS, GPABBING IT, and HURLS IT AWAY. 
It lands in a tangle but is up again in a microsecond, jumps at her, knocks her back into the room, on her, its claws digging into her skin, piston tongue at her face, inches away. 
She locks an arm around its slick, long head and pulls back we hear its tendons strain, snap. 
CALL (to a guard) 
Shoot it!  Shoot them both! 
She grabs his gun and BURNS them both.  Two less-than-human SCREAMS fill the room as they briefly disentangle, thrown apart. 
The beast recovers first, dodging the next blast and going for Ripley again. 
Ripley, on her back, reaches behind her, grabs a table leg and with inhuman strength brings the table down on the monster's head. 
She dives at it as it comes out from under.... 
Call shoots as Ripley hits the alien, they're both fried as Ripley's momentum sends them over a railing and they FALL TWENTY FEET -- the Alien lands with a spine snapping crunch, 
Ripley only slightly better. 
A few crew members rush to look over the railing.  Christie starts down the spiral staircase to that level. 
JOHNER 
Where are you going? 
The creature rolls back onto Ripley, grabbing her with its dying strength. Her face is rigid with pain and anger as she holds it off... its jaws open, dripping shaking... 
The tongue SHOOTS OUT and Ripley GRABS IT. HOLDS IT. 
A scream wells up in her throat.  A totally animal killshriek that she SCREAMS, victorious, as she RIPS THE ALIEN'S TONGUE OUT OF ITS FACE. 
She stands, bellows another warrior cry. The crew has gathered near. They watch her, awed, wary. Ripley walks slowly up to them -- up to Call.  Ripley looks a tad pissed. 
Call tenses, maybe wishing she hadn't shot Ripley as well. 
Ripley takes Call's hand, puts the tongue in it. walks on. 
Call looks at the dripping souvenier.  The pincers at the end still twitching. 
CHRISTIE 
What the FUCK is going on here? 
RANE 
What was that thing?  Are there more of that thing? 
JOHNER (to Call) 
Make a hell of a necklace... 
ANGLE: HILLARD 
on the upper level, kneeling by Elgyn's body.  No tears, but terribly quiet. 
What do we do? 
CHRISTIE 
Same thing we were doing.  We get the fuck. 
RANE 
What if there's more?  Let's stay here and let the army guys deal. Someone will come... I mean, where are the fucking army guys? 
St Just is very calmly looking up at the rafters, guns drawn 
CHRISTIE 
Doctor.  You know what that thing is? 
WREN 
I do. 
CHRISTIE 
And there's others.  How many? 
The doctor looks around, almost guiltily. 
WREN 
Thirty. 
JOHNER 
Thirty!  We are fucked in our pink bottoms if there's thirty of those things. 
RIPLEY 
There'll be more. 
Everyone looks around at her.  She is squatting in the corner facing away from them. 
RIPLEY 
They'll breed.  In a few hours there'll be twice that number. 
The group looks it over. Parts of the ship are simply not there, the sections around those holes red.  Wren points them out. 
WREN 
We've had hull breach by the lifeboats, here on level five, and down -- Jesus, right by the engine room.  We're very lucky. 
ST JUST (sarcastically) 
Lucky we. 
CHRISTIE 
What about the Betty?  Our ship. 
WREN 
The dock seems to be intact. 
CHRISTIE 
Then we head for it. 
JOHNER 
Can we track those fucking things? 
WREN 
No. 
JOHNER 
We could get to the Betty and they could be all over it! 
RANE 
Are you toting a better fucking idea? 
WREN 
All of the activity seems'to have been in the aft-sector, by the barracks. 
There's no reason to suppose they'd move 
RIPLEY 
They won't. 
Everybody looks at her. 
RIPLEY 
They're breeding. They've got new bodies to work on. They'll stay close. If they send anybody out, it'll be here. Where the... meat is. 
CALL 
'The meat' . Jesus. 
ST JUST 
They're breeding.  How long does that take? 
RIPLEY 
Hours. 
WREN 
Or less.  The process has accelerated, something to do with the cloned cells. 
CHRISTIE 
Faster we get from here to there, the better. 
ST JUST 
With all the devils of hell in between. 
JOHNER 
Well, if we want to make decent time I say we ditch the cripple. 
(to Vriess) 
No offense. 
VRIESS (giving him the finger) 
None taken. 
HILLARD 
Nobody's left behind, Johner. Not even you. 
Her voice is quiet, mourning still thick in it.  Nobody backtalks her. 
CHRISTIE 
So what's our route? 
WREN 
I'm trying to figure it. we can cut through the labs, but we're blocked on both sides here, 
I'm not sure 
DISTEPHMO 
Sir?  There is the lift. 
WREN 
Show me. 
DiStephano works the console and the hologram splits, the route he's indicating revealed. 
DISTEPHMO 
The lifts. They run straight from the top of the ship down to engineering. No stops, but  if we can get in the shaft, there's a maintenece access tunnel here 
(points to the center of the shaft) 
that runs above level one deck. Take us right to the dock. 
CHRISTIE 
Sounds reasonable. 
DISTEPHANO 
I don't have the code for the access tunnel door. 
WREN 
I can override. 
DISTEPHMO 
(indicating the route) 
Then we head through the labs, then down to the kitchen.  To the bottom of the shaft. 
Up, through the tunnel, and onto the ship.  Home free. 
CHRISTIE 
I understand my hide.  And I like it on me. Let's go. 
(to Ripley) 
What are you called, Ripley?  You mind taking point? 
She moves to the head of the line, and they start. 
CUT TO: INT.  LABS - LATER 
As they progress.  Everyone with a gun has it at the ready.  Ripley is a few yards in front. 
She stops, sniffs.  Listens. 
RIPLEY 
Clear. 
Johner moves up next to her. 
JOHNER 
You've come up against these things before? 
RIPLEY 
Yes. 
JOHNER 
So what did you do ? 
RIPLEY 
I died. 
He lags behind a bit, thrown. 
JOHNER 
That wasn't really what I wanted to hear... 
DiStephano points to a door. 
DISTEPFANO 
This way. 
And Ripley leads them in. 
CUT TO: INT.  LAB - CONTINUOUS 
As Ripley enters, we can see that this lab has been trashed.  Ripley surveys the wreckage calmly, keeps moving. As the others file in, their horrified expressions lend contrast to her lack of one. 
Among the debris are three bodies, chests exploded outward. 
JOHNER 
Fuck me ... 
CHRISTIE 
Let's keep moving. 
The door to the next chamber is ajar. Christie and Vriess in, then St Just, then Ripley. 
INT..NEXT CHAMBER 
Something LEAPS at Ripley from out of the shadows -- a metal bar SLAMS into her side, throwing her off balance. 
St Just and Christie spin, weapons up, and almost shoot the figure cowering in the corner. 
Everyone else rushes in as he swings the bar before him, eyes wild with terror. 
PURVIS 
Get away from me! 
CHRISTIE 
Drop the rod, man.  Do it! 
PURVIS. 
Get away... 
But the energy is out of him.  The rod falls with a hollow clatter. He looks weakly from face to face. 
PURVIS 
What's going on? 
St Just looks at his name, stitched in his coveralls. 
ST JUST 
Purvis.  What's going on is that we're getting the fuck off this ghost ship. 
PURVIS 
What ship?  Where am I? 1 was in cryo on the way to Xarem, work crew for the nickel refinery... 
I wake up, I don't understand... I saw something... horrible ... 
CALL 
Look, you come with us.  It's dangerous here. 
Ripley SNIFFS.  Cocks her head. 
RIPLEY 
Leave him. 
CALL 
Fuck you.  We're not leaving anyone on this boat. 
RIPLEY 
He's carrying.. 
JOHNER 
He's what? 
RIPLEY 
He's got one....	inside him. I can smell it. 
PURVIS 
Inside me? What? 
JOHNER 
Shit, I don't want one of those things birthing anywhere near my ass. 
VRIESS 
It's a bad risk. 
CHRISTIE 
You want to get yourself killed, then you run solo. 
ST JUST 
How many? 
RIPLEY 
At least two. 
ST JUST 
Think they heard us? 
RIPLEY 
Yep. 
HILLARD 
Fine by me ... 
JOHNER 
Yeah, let 'em come. 
CHRISTIE 
Wren.  Any other way around? 
Wren shakes his head. 
CHRISTIE 
We can't just walk in there. 
WREN (thinking) 
No. No, but they can. 
CHRISTIE 
Say again? 
WREN 
The cages all have failsafes.  Liquid nitrogen.  Get 'em to come to us and I can freeze em. 
CHRISTIE 
Excellent.   Get-ready. 
Wren goes over to the failsafe button. The others look out at the aliens. 
CHRISTIE 
Okay... (calls out) Hey! 
VRIESS 
Hey, guys! 
JOHNER 
Here, kitty... 
The aliens react, start for the cage.  Four 'of them.  They reach the edge of it and stop. 
Look around, at each other.. 
But go nowhere. 
DISTEPHMO 
They're not coming. 
JOHNER 
Hey!  Fresh meat here! 
RIPLEY. 
They know it's a trap. 
RANE 
Oh, bullshit! 
CHRISTIE 
What do we do? 
JOHNER 
Shoot the fucking things! 
VRIESS 
There's too many, and we don't have the angle. 
RIPLEY 
Bait. 
CALL 
What? 
RIPLEY 
Give em a reason to go in there. Throw somebody in. 
HILLARD 
Fuck you! 
RIPLEY 
DO we want to live? Give em her. 
She indicates Call, who looks around, nervous at the lack of protest about this idea. 
Ripley points at Rane. 
RIPLEY 
Or the skinny one, it doesn't matter. We can't resist the smell of meat. 
CALL 
We ? 
JOHNER 
Fuck, I'm with her!  Give 'em Annalee! 
CHRISTIE 
Now hold on 
DISTEPHMO 
Each one more horrifying than the last, and the last the worst of all. 
Ripley approaches, and stares at number seven. 
A complete mixture of alien and human DNA. 
A tortured, disgusting hybrid, half Ripley, half nightmare. 
Hooked up wires and machines, it lies on the tilted-table, its head nearly level with 
Ripley's as she finally approaches it. 
When it opens its eyes, they are hers. 
it tuns its head ever so slightly to look at her.  Recognises her. 
Ripley cannot even speak.  She begins to shake slightly looking at number seven. 
NUMBER SEVEN 
Kill ... us ... 
Ripley's eyes go saucered as it speaks speaks out of nothing resembling a mouth. 
Ripley staggers back a step, shaking now.  This is too much to bear... 
CALL 
Ripley! 
Ripley turns, slowly, still in a fever dream. 
Call cocks the grenade launcher with a loud CRACK.  Her eyes meet Ripley's. 
Call tosses it to Ripley as the crew steps back and even a catches it Ripley FIRES, a grenade chugging to the end of room and BURSTING in fire and noise, she FIRES another, tissue and steel exploding into flame, she turns to number seven, hand shakes momentarily...And she FIRES, the poor creature dissolving in a cloud of flame. 
Freezing gas jets fill the room, extinguishing potential spread, but the heart of the firestorm continues to rage in the chamber. 
She backs out, the crew waiting for her outside. 
The launcher falls loudly to the ground.  Ripley turns to Wren, her face rigid with pain. 
Wren backs up a step, looking around him for protection that the others have no thought of providing. 
CALL 
Ripley... Don't do it. 
Ripley stops. weariness suffusing her expression. 
RIPLEY 
Don't do what? 
The tension pases.  Wren breathes a little sigh of relief. 
Call PUNCHES him across the jaw, his head whipping around as collapses to the ground. 
Call starts down the hall, not even looking at him. 
CALL 
Don't do that. 
Feeling his jaw, Wren actually smiles at the absurdity of all this. It's kind of winning. 
Christie helps him up. 
CHRISTIE 
Had it coming, Doc. 
Johner looks in at the burning lab. 
JOHNER 
What's the big deal?  Fucking waste of ammo. 
ST JUST 
Let's move before anything comes to check out the noise. 
JOHNER 
Chicks, man.... 
DISTEPHANO 
We go down from here. 
CHRISTIE (to Vriess) 
We got to lose the chair.  Vriess. 
VRIESS 
I know. 
CHRISTIE 
Kawlang maneuver, all right? 
Vriess is pulling a coil of cords from the chair. 
VRIESS 
Just like old times... 
CUT TO: INT.  ROOM - LATER 
A hatch opens. Ripley drops down, surveys the scene.  Quiet dark, empty. 
Ripley comes up, Call behind her.  Ripley sniffs, listens.  Closes her eyes. After a beat she starts further in and Call motions for others to follow. 
Slowly, they make their way down the corridor. Ripley, Cal ,Hillard , guns drawn. 
Bringing up the rear is Christie, toting a shotgun.. He turn slowly, alert, and we see that Vriess is strapped to his back facing the other way, also with a shotgun. 
CALL (to Ripley) 
That lab... 1 can't imagine how that must feel. 
RIPLEY 
No. You can't. 
Ripley looks down.  The floor here is covered with a foot or so of dark water. 
Ripley steps into it, moves up a few paces. The others gingerly follow. 
Vriess is facing the back. He looks up. 
VRIESS 
The cooling tanks.  They must have blown during the trouble. 
ANGLE: THE COOLING TANKS 
We see the round underbelly of two huge tanks.  There are gaping, twisted holes in them. 
JOHNER 
The nasties couldn't have done it, could they? 
Rane is coming along and alien hands grab at him from the darkness, pull him into it. 
Hillard FIRES in that direction, Johner bringing up the rear still firing at the third one, wounding it but not scoring killshot. 
Call is swimming up ther staircase, the growing light above indicating the surface. 
She is almost to it when she is IN THE WEB. 
A net of translucent alien goo, it is spread just six inche below the surface. 
Call struggles the goo sticking to her she's running out of air -- as Wren and Christie enconter the same thing -- they all try to tear through it, but they are getting weaker. 
Ripley looks back as the last of the crew is passing her, aliens close behind. 
She looks up to see the situation ab and quickly makes for the surface -- but an  alien GRABS her foot, holding her down. Now SHE is running out of air KICKS at it, it  lets go. 
The others are fighting, Call pops her stilletto and cuts through, but it's tough, she  still can't get her head up -- 
--Di Stephano, off to the side, is drowning.  Takes in a huge mouthful of water and begins thrashing. 
Ripley swims past everyone and grabs the hole Call cut, pulls it apart with a mighty heave, she glides up through -- 
CLOSE UP: RIPLEY'S FACE 
Just BREAKS the surface, she takes in a huge GASP of air, FACEHUGGER CLAMPS DOWN ON HER. 
Ripley goes back under, pulling at the thing as others break the surface. 
Wren comes up and a hugger LEAPS right at him ,but Call nails it in four shots. 
Christie and Vriess break surface and both begin FIRING, back to back, in a circular sweep. 
They decimate a number of eggs 
ANGLE: UNDERWATER 
Ripley pulls the face hugger with all her might -- it comes off, its fingers singeing the sides of her face, leaving marks like warpaint. Worse, its probing fleshy member pulls last of her throat, thrashing horribly. 
In utmost disgust, Ripley PULLS it APART. and the three aliens are COMING RIGHT AT HER. 
ABOVE - THE SURFACE 
Most of the crew has gotten up out of the water.  Christie holding a facehugger inches from his face, others screaming, taking a bead on it. 
CHRISTIE 
Get it!  Kill it! 
CALL 
The blood'll burn you!  Throw it! 
He does, and Johner nails it in midflight. 
Hillard and Johner pull Di Stephano out of the water, but he is not breathing. 
ANGLE: UNDER THE SURFACE 
Ripley is grabbed by an alien -- and St Just comes up behind her and shoots it. 
They swim up and away from the spreading, lethal bloodpool. 
ANGLE: ABOVE THE SURFACE 
They come up out of the water, and an alien rises right behind them. Everyone who can, shoots it.  It falls back into the water. 
CHRISTIE 
A trap!  They set a goddamn ambush! 
JOHNER 
Give me that! 
He pulls the burner off Di Stephano's body, even as Call is giving him mouth to mouth. 
Johner flips the gun open and FIRES at the water, the whole thing SMOKING and sizzling with the electrical charge. we hear an alien wail bubble from below the surface. 
JOHNER (grinning feverishly) 
Okay!  Everybody out of the pool! 
VRIESS 
Let's get the fuck! 
Di Stephano sputters back to life.  Ripley picks him up with one hand, 
HILLARD (to Wren) 
Which way? 
WREN 
Up here. 
He takes off, the others following. 
WREN 
Up through the lift shaft! 
He stops at a pair of sliding doors, starts working the panel.  Ripley come up to the doors and pulls them apart with a grunt. 
ST JUST 
Company! 
He's refering to the noise and shadow of approaching aliens. 
She herds them into the shaft. 
CUT TO: INT.  LIFTSHAFT - CONTINUOUS 
It goes down about four stories, and up seemingly forever.. Enough room for or three 
elevators, one of which is two stories below. 
WREN 
UP! 
He starts climbing.  It's not that hard -- there are ladders in each shaft section. 
Call comes up behind him.  Ripley and others pair off on other ladders. 
They climb fast, they're three stories up before the aliens begin POUNDING on the metal door, it buckles under their might. 
JOHNER 
Move! 
WREN 
Not far! 
Still POUNDING -- one alien gets its head in, looks up, hisses, pulls it out. 
ANGLE: LIFT 
Wren comes to a cralwspace ledge.  He climbs on.  Set back a few feet from the shaft is a small maintenance access door. works the keypad beside it as Call climbs up behind him. 
The aliens SMASH through the door, one of them SAILING across the shaft to grab a pipe on the other side. Instantly four of them are swarming up the walls, moving much faster  on pipes and ridges than the humans on ladders. 
HILLARD 
Assface, We're on the top of this thing. 
(pointing to the ceiling) 
That's hull. 
VRIESS 
What about Wren? if he gets in the computer he can really fuck us around. 
RIPLEY 
We have to get in too. 
DISTEPHANO 
There's no access console on this level. We'd have to-backtrack. 
HILLARD 
Fuck that. 
DISTEPHANO 
And I don't have the security access that Wren does anyway. 
Ripley turns to Call. 
RIPLEY 
Call. 
CALL 
No. I can't. 
JOHNER. 
Bullshit.  She's a damn well talking machine. 
CALL 
There's another way. 
DISTEPHMO 
Just tell her to access it on remote. 
VRIESS 
Shit, that's right.  Any of the new model droids can access the mainframe. 
JOHNER 
Just by blinking. 
CALL 
I can't. 
ST JUST 
No time to get coy, Annalee. 
CALL 
I can't. I burned my modem drive.  We all did. 
VRIESS 
You can still patch in manually. You know that. 
Call looks over at the group, staring at her.  She knows she doesn't have a choice. 
DISTEPHANO 
There's ports in the chapel. 
RIPLEY 
Come on. 
(to the others) 
You get started on that wall. 
CUT TO: INT.  CHAPEL - CONTINUOU@ 
Ripley and Call enter the small room.  Ripley sits in one of the pews, pulls out a bible. 
it somewhat resembles a Newton Under the leather flap is a screen reading.: 
HOLY BIBLE.  PRE START. 
Ripley pulls out the cord from the bible's port, holds it up 
CALL 
Don't make me do this. 
RIPLEY 
Don't make me make you. 
CALL 
I don't want to go in there. 
RIPLEY 
Get over it. 
CALL 
It's like... your insides are liquid. It's not real. 
RIPLEY 
You can blow the ship.  Before it reaches Earth.  Kill them all.  Just give us time to get 
out first. 
That convinces Call.  She pulls up her sleeve, and begins. pushes a part of her forearm, 
just below the crook of her elbow.  It has a spring release catch, and a small panel rises 
up with two computer ports on it.  She takes the cable from Ripley and plugs it in. 
It looks almost like she's mainlining heroin. 
She cocks her head. 
CALL 
Dammit. 
RIPLEY 
Anything? 
CALL 
Yes.  But I'm finding a lot of things funny lately.  And I'm not sure they are. 
CALL 
Why do you go on living?  How can you stand it?  How can you stand... yourself? 
Ripley shrugs. 
RIPLEY 
Not so hard.  Not much choice. 
CALL 
At least there's part of you that's human.  I'm just... fuck.  Look at me.... 
She looks at the hole in her chest, the white and sticky fibers. 
CALL 
I'm disgusting. 
Her voice is at its slowest here, low and eerie.  It's a mechanical problem, but 
it sounds just like despair. 
RIPLEY 
Do you dream? 
CALL 
I ... we have neural processors that run through....  (stops)  Yes. 
RIPLEY 
When I sleep, I dream about it.  Them.  Every night.  All around me ... in me. 
I used to be afraid to dream, but I'm not anymore. 
CALL 
Why? 
RIPLEY 
Because no matter how bad the dreams get ... when I wake up it's always worse. 
Purvis enters. 
PURVIS 
I guess we're almost there. 
RIPLEY 
Right. 
He exits again.  Call finishes fiddling with her internal wiring.  We hear her voice slip back to normal as she says: 
CALL 
Let's get going. 
CUT TO: INT. TUNNEL 
As they come one by one through the wall. 
DISTEPHANO 
Not far now. 
PURVIS 
God, I'm so tired... 
JOHNER 
Yeah, well, we'll sleep when we're dead. 
Ripley follows him through. 
RIPLEY 
Don't count on it. 
The rest of them come through and walk into: 
INT.  THE GARDEN    CONTINUOUS 
The Garden runs nearly half a mile straight across, and then down on a terraced slope. 
Everywhere are different kinds of plants: trees, vegetable plants, exotic and experimental hybrids. 
Access paths crisscross the beds. 
It's huge, the single biggest space on the ship.  Yet the low ceiling, laticed with grow-lamps now dim in nightcycle, and prodigeous undergrowth make it labyrinthian, almost claustrophobic. 
From where the crew is, they can barely see where it slopes down. 
JOHNER 
What's this fucking deal? 
DISTEPHMO 
This supplies most of the food for the unit. 
VRIESS (holding a lucious ripe pear) 
You guys got something against spam? 
DISTEPHMO 
And there's some lab work here too. Hybridization. 
RIPLEY 
At the other end? 
DISTEPHMO 
Runs down to the by the waste tanks.  We can get to the dock from there.  You, okay? 
Ripley is holding her head.  She shuts her eyes. 
CALL 
What is it? 
Ripley shakes it off. 
RIPLEY 
Nothing.  I'm okay. 
She looks out at the jungle, they have to cross. 
CALL 
We should get moving. 
ST JUST 
St Just! 
ST JUST 
You go. 
He looks at the appraching aliens. 
ST JUST 
I'm bored. 
CALL\SHIP 
Warning.  Evacuate sector. 
A moment, then the crew takes off. 
St Just takes a handful of pills, pops them into his mouth.  Only the slightest  grin suffuses his face ,as he waits for the aliens. 
They close on him, and he raises his guns. 
CALL\SHIP 
warning... 
CUT TO: 
INT HALL NEARBY - CONTINUOUS 
The crew runs full out. 
DISTEPHANO 
We have to get out of the sector! 
RIPLEY 
Where! 
DISTEPHANO 
There! 
He points at a door that's down two flights and across the hall. 
CUT TO: INT. HALL CONTINUOUS 
The aliens close, and St Just FIRES, blasting away with bot guns. Aliens writhe on the 
floor before him, still they cover the bodies of their brothers, still he fires, 
Call\ship monotones of warning in sharp contrast to the chaos 
-- St Just fires until both guns are empty.  In one smooth motion he drops them both 
and jerks his wrists and TWO-MORE disposable guns fly into his palms and he blasts away 
ANGLE: THE BLOOD 
Eating through the hull. 
ANGLE: THE CREW 
desperately racing for the door. 
ANGLE: ST JUST 
Firing with quiet glee. 
ANGLE: THE CREW 
The first of them are through the door. 
ANGLE: St JUST 
The aliens are getting closer, but still he mows them down Both his guns click, spent. 
ST JUST 
Damn. 
CALL\SHIP 
Warning -- 
and BOOM!!!!, the hall BURSTS OPEN, everything explodes into space, the wind rushes out as 
BOOM!!!, the whole garden sector rips open, sucked out, as 
ANGLE: RIPLEY 
is the last to get out, but the pressure change SUCKS HER she flies backwards, the section door coming down just in time as she SLAMS into it, the door closing fully as she falls, lack of pressure sucks at the door itself, it creaks and be inward slightly, but it holds. 
The others have exited into the next hall.  They've been tossed about, but not as badly. 
Call stops, runs back to Ripley, helps her up.  Ripley is dazed; the door hit the back of her head solidly. 
CALL 
Can you walk?  RIPLEY 
I think I... 
CALL 
I'm not fucking carrying you 
Ripley doesn't even hear her; something else drowns Call out. Ripley puts her hands over her ears. 
RIPLEY 
Mistake ... mistake... 
CALL 
Ripley. 
RIPLEY 
I can hear them, in the hive... it's close...	We're on the hive. 
CALL 
Jesus.  Come on. 
RIPLEY 
I can hear them... the queen... 
CALL 
What... ? 
RIPLEY 
She's in pain. 
They CRASH UP through the floor panels, six of them, surrounding the two women. 
Call can barely spin before Ripley GRABS her and HURLS her fifteen feet down the corridor, out of harm's way. 
The aliens close on Ripley. She struggles but she's still weak.  One slams her onto the ground call recovers, looks back at Ripley 
and head for the cockpit.  DiStephano deposits Vriess in a wheelchair. 
CALL 
Johner, take Purvis to the freezer. 
JOHNER 
All right.. Nap time, buddy. 
A GUNSHOT and Purvis goes flying, blood spurting out of his shoulder, Johner draws but 
Wren emerges from the shadows too fast. 
Wren grabs Call and very carefully holds his gun to her back right below her shoulderblades. 
WREN 
Fuck with me and I put a bullet where her brain is! 
Johner stands, uncertain. 
WREN 
DiStephano!  Take their weapons. 
DISTEPHANO 
Begging your pardon, sir, but eat my fuck. 
DiStephano aims at Wren.  Wren backs up a step. 
WREN 
Drop it!  Drop it or we all die together! 
Heaped in the, corner, Purvis suddenly jerks forward.  His eyes go wide. 
CUT TO: INT.  WASTE TANK 5   CONTINUOUS 
Ripley is frantically trying to pull at her bonds.  It's just beginning to work. 
But the noise in here is getting worse, the aliens franitcally agitated as the Queens belly begins moving more violently.  SHRIEKS, and RIPLEY does as well, from effort or sympathy, it is hard to tell, as 
THE QUEENS BELLY POPS OPEN.  Blood shoots everywhere, burning into the walls. 
And all the screaming stops.  The movement stops.  Even Ripley stops. Silence. 
Something emerges from the wound. 
An alien, to be sure, but nothing we've seen so far, its forelegs arch out of its back like spiders legs, its back legs set on enormous haunches, thick and powerful. 
Its head is long, eyeless, like the others, but along its white expanse red veins, coming out of the skin and running like thick black hairs to the back. 
It has retracted pincers at the side of head that come out when its tongue does. 
Its much bigger the the others, nearly the size of the queen herself. 
And it's bone white. 
GEDIMAN 
Beautiful.... beautiful butterfly... 
He is crying with revelatory joy.  Ripley is not.  Grimacing the sight and smell of the new beast, she begins pulling again at her bonds. 
One of the soldiers, at the 'other end of the room from Ripley wakes up. 
Dangling uselessly at his side is a rifle -- the real deal, not a burner. 
SOLDIER 
No, God... 
He SCREAMS in uncomprehending horror.  The newborn stops, tilting its head: 
It LEAPS up to the ceiling in a second, quick and effortless as a monstrous flea. 
Leaps again and lands on the screaming soldier, gripping his sides with its four forelegs as he screams lustily. 
pincers SWING out and pin either side of his head.. His eyes go wide as: 
Its tongue SHOOTS into his throat.  Stays there, and we watch it drain the blood from his body.  We can see it, see its stomach swell, red tinged, as his body goes 
blue and slack. His rifle drops into the black pool. 
Gediman stares, transfixed, and it LANDS ON HIM.

Johner's gun drops to the floor. 
Everyone backs off. 
WREN 
The fucking robot is going to plug back into the Auriga and land it according to standard operational procedure. 
CALL 
No she's not. 
DISTEPHMO 
You're fucking nuts.  You still want to bring those things back to earth? 
JOHNER 
Have you been paying any attention today? 
WREN

CALL 
Fucking shoot me. 
WREN 
Shut up!!! 
And Purvis LAUNCHES from the corner, screaming, jumps on wren - Wren gets off a couple of shots -- nails DiStephano in the face.  The soldier drops like a sack. 
The other shots hit the ship, Call dives for cover as Purvis SLAMS his fist across Wren's face, Wren fires again and Jo is on the ground, rolling, grabbing his gun -- 
Purvis is a man possessed.  He grabs Wren's gunhand and SMAS it against an instrument panel, bone cracking audibly as wren drops the gun. 
Purvis jerks.  Blood blooms in his chest. 
Everybody stops, mesmerized. wren drops to his knees, going for the gun, and Purvis grabs him from behind, pulls him so that the back of Wren's head is against his chest. 
Purvis jerks again.  It takes Wren a moment to understand what's happening. 
They both scream. 
Then alien BURSTS out of Purvis's chest, STRAIGHT INTO WRENS SKULL. 
Everyone else is still frozen.  Then the little critter bursts out of Wrens face, flying straight at Vriess.  CUT TO: INT.  WASTE TANK 5 - CONTINUOUS 
Ripley TEARS one of her arms free as the newborn feeds beside her. 
Gediman is already a shell.

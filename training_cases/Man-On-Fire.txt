"Man On Fire" 
OPENING TITLE SEQUENCE 
EXT.   MEXICO CITY - DAY 
High over the city on a bright Sunday morning, the sun pounding its way through the orange haze of smog. As we descend toward the clots of traffic blocking the streets: the sounds of a Mass being sung. 
A CATHOLIC CHURCH 
The big wooden doors open to release the parishioners inside. Feature a tall, lanky 18-YEAR-OLD. Holding his GIRLFRIEND'S hand, anxious for Sunday to really begin. They don't notice the traffic suddenly thin, like a faucet's been cranked down. They move toward a Mercedes 500. As a CHAUFFEUR holds the back door open for them... 
A GRAND MARQUIS 
Squeals around the corner, lurches to a stop alongside the Mercedes. FOUR MEN get out flashing  badges. In a moment they're hustling Eighteen toward the car, stiff- arming the chauffeur. As the girlfriend  cries and the gossip among the parishioners begins... 
The Grand Marquis pulls away. 
INT.   GRAND MARQUIS - DAY 
They shove eighteen down to the floor of the backseat. These guys are not the police. 
A switchblade is flicked open. Practiced hands slit the boy's Sunday suit from the base of his neck to his heels. Eighteen yelps as the blade draws blood across one calf. 
Duct tape is wrapped around his hands, eyes, and head. 
EXT.   WOODED AREA - DAY 
The Marquis is parked across from another CAR. FOUR NEW GUYS wait as Eighteen is hauled out of the Marquis. His clothes drop away like a snake shedding its skin. He stands naked, bound and blind. Eighteen is handed over from one group to the other. 
INT. TELEPHONE - UPSCALE HOME - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
The phone rings. A bomb going off. Eighteen's distraught FATHER (family photos of the boy on the wall) answers. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    2. 
REVERSE TO REVEAL a battery of POLICE and NEGOTIATORS in the room with him. One of them listens in, waves fingers at him as the negotiations begin. 
INT.   VIDEO SURVEILLANCE OF AN 8' X 4' CELL - DAY 
A wall smeared with God-knows-what. Facing   it, Eighteen stands naked blindfolded and shivering. The   back of his leg still bleeds. He shifts nervously as a   little JACK RUSSELL TERRIER eagerly licks the blood off  his calf. 
A MAN ('The Dreamer'), we don't see his face, negotiates by cell phone. Voice calm. As he runs numbers, he slaps his thigh. Jack Russell trots over, gets an ear scratched. 
At a motion from the man, Eighteen is taken down to the ground. Straddled by two men, his head is mummified in tape leaving one ear exposed. 
CUT TO T.V. - Rosanna Garcia Guerrero, editor of REFORMA newspaper, being interviewed, "...organized crime syndicates...growth of kidnapping in Mexico over the last two years." 
EXT.   UPSCALE HOUSE - DAY 
As a hand removes a ziplock baggie from the mailbox. A glimpse of something we don't want to see. An ear partially obscured by sweating plastic and a blood smear. 
EXT.   CITY SQUARE - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 
A MERCEDES driving around the square, Eighteen's father waving a white shirt out the window like a surrender flag. 
EXT.   BRIDGE - NIGHT (3 AM) 
Footbridge over railway sandwiched between freeway. Empty train blazes through. Dangerous, deserted downtown neighborhood. Looks more like "war torn Beirut", burnt out cars and trash. The 18 year old's father, naked to the waist, walks from the family Mercedes over the footbridge carrying a pillowcase full of cash to a semi- derelict car on the opposite side with a white piece of fabric taped in the rear windshield and trunk open. He slams the pillow case in the trunk and leaves. 
EXT.   DOWNTOWN MEXICO CITY - TWILIGHT 
RUSH HOUR. A red stream of headlights separated from a white stream of taillights by a narrow median. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        3. 
HORNS blare as a CAR stops. Eighteen, still blindfolded, is dumped on the median. The car pulls away. 
He stands there in the whirlwind. Pathetically SCREAMING for help. More horns, shouts, no help. 
END MAIN TITLES.   Goes to black. 
CREASY'S VOICE Ezekiel 25:17 Blessed is he who in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
Samuel Valencia Ramos and his lawyer Jordan Kalfus in the privacy of an alcove table. Jordan is well heeled, well connected and well oiled. In that order. Samuel, at 40, already has the patrician look that has served the male members of his family for generations. They discuss the kidnapping, a headline on the paper Jordan tosses aside. 
JORDAN The family paid the ransom and he was returned two days later. (laughs; chews) His father still hasn't gotten up the nerve to ask him if they fucked him up the ass. 
SAMUEL And now every mother with money in Mexico City wants bigger and better bodyguards. My own wife included. 
JORDAN If she pisses you off, you get another one. 
SAMUEL (laughs grimly) Do you know what she told me last night? 
FLASH TO: 
INT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 
Samuel sits at his baby    grand piano playing a gentle rendering of 'Delibes'.     His American wife LISA stands away from him. Just the     sight of her back reveals a pitch perfect petulance.    She tells him: 
FLASH.   Fingers being fingerprinted. 
JUMPCUTS - suitcase being stripped and ripped (MIDNIGHT EXPRESS), pack of Marlboro, bottle of Jack Daniels, glimpse a weathered Bible (New Testament), intercut with seven pieces of blue steel separated in different parts of the bag, ie. toiletries, underwear, lining of suitcase. 
The seven pieces laid together look remarkably like a well travelled Sig Sauer 226. Creasy smiles. 
EXT. JUAREZ, MEXICO FOUR BIG BURLY SUV'S - DRIVING ACROSS THE BORDER CHECKPOINT - DAY 
INT. SUV - DAY 
Six Japanese BUSINESSMEN jabber on cellphones. PAUL RAYBURN sits up front trying not to spill coffee on the mini Uzi cradled in his lap. As his own cell phone rings, he answers. 
RAYBURN Rayburn here. 
INT. CUSTOMS HOLDING TANK - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
Creasy on payphone. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        8. 
CREASY When did Mexican Customs start getting smart? 
RAYBURN's SUV 
RAYBURN Creasy???   Where the fuck are you? 
CUSTOMS JAIL 
CREASY I'm here. 
RAYBURN's SUV 
RAYBURN What do you mean, I'm here? 
CUSTOMS JAIL 
CREASY I'm in a Customs holding tank in Mexico City International. Bring a bunch of cash... about 5K. I'm going to need it. 
INT. CUSTOMS AREA - A BACK OFFICE Rayburn has 5K U.S. dollars laid out on      the desk between him, the Customs official, and Creasy.       The remains of the suitcase are spread around the room.       The main offender, the gun being front and center      next to the cash. Looks like the official is going       to fold. 
RAYBURN This is going to cost you big time. 
INT. STRIP BAR - Rethink Location 
A stripper does a half hearted grind as Rayburn and Creasy sit at the bar sharing a bottle of 'Jack'. 
RAYBURN You got a secondary search and you had a gun. 
CREASY Listen it was a calculated risk. I've done it a million times and never got caught. 
RAYBURN Everything happens once if you live long enough. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     9. 
CREASY It doesn't make sense to x-ray your bags coming off the plane. 
RAYBURN This is Mexico, they do everything backwards. 
Creasy hits the 'Jack'. 
RAYBURN So what's wrong? 
CREASY Nothing wrong. 
RAYBURN Don't give me that bullshit. 
Creasy changes subject. 
CREASY So how's business? 
RAYBURN Japanese are here in a big way. Cheap labor. Factory space. But they feel a lot safer living over the border in El Paso. I ferry 'em back and forth. They think I'm John-fucking-Wayne. 
CREASY But don't you stay in El Paso? 
RAYBURN Fuck, I love Mexico.   I live like a king down here. 
Creasy takes a look around the Seedy Bar. 
CREASY Yeah, right... 
RAYBURN Oh, like you haven't been in worse places. 
CREASY And a level five shithole is better than a level six. Your logic's inescapable. 
Rayburn laughs. Creasy takes the bottle.     Creasy's hand is mottled by old burn marks. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    10. 
RAYBURN You been working? 
CREASY Not for eight months. I was in Columbia looking around, but, nothing seemed interesting. 
RAYBURN How long you staying, Crease? 
CREASY (shrugs) Got no plans, Rayburn, Nothing on. Just wanted to see you, how you were. Came by on impulse. 
Rayburn studies his friend a beat, just seeing the cracks that weren't there last time they met. 
RAYBURN You did something on impulse? 
CREASY Everything happens once if you live long enough. 
Creasy smiles. 
INT.   PINTA'S BEDROOM - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 
Nine-year-old PINTA MARTIN RAMOS stares out at the garden, a bit like Creasy, but only a ten yard stare. Pinta's eyes brim with life. She folds her hands, closes her eyes, prays. 'Chopin' drifts up from downstairs. Samuel on the baby grand. 
Samuel hands back the gun. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   14. 
SAMUEL You will meet my wife first. She would like it if you are presentable, polite and respectful. You'll be the fifth candidate she's seen this week. 
Samuel flips through a manila folder. 
SAMUEL Your resume is impressive. Nine years in the Army. Extensive counter terrorism work. I shouldn't be able to afford you in my current state. What's the catch? 
CREASY (honest) I drink. 
SAMUEL How does it affect you? 
CREASY My coordination. Reaction time. If top professionals try to kidnap your daughter, the service will be on par with the pay. 
SAMUEL And what if amateurs try it? 
CREASY I'll probably kill them.   Is that likely? 
SAMUEL No. And no one is to know of your drinking problem. That includes my wife. 
As they pull up to the Ramos' impressive hacienda. 
INT.   SITTING ROOM - RAMOS VILLA - MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 
Where Lisa is flipping through TV channels; Sky News, CNN, etc... Each one showing some terrorist act - West Bank protest, Madrid car bombing. 
Samuel and Creasy, meanwhile, enter behind her.      She clicks it off, looks back at them. 
LISA The world of our children.   How dare they? 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      15. 
CREASY (shrugs) It's war. The weakest suffer the most. 
LISA You're American. 
CREASY So are you. 
SAMUEL (introducing) My wife, Mr. Creasy. 
LISA Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy. 
Lisa steps over, shakes Creasy's hand.    Gives him a quick once over. 
LISA (CONT'D) Would you like a drink? 
Creasy doesn't hesitate, doesn't look at Samuel and has no irony in his answer. 
CREASY Thank you.     Scotch and a little water. 
She steps to the bar to make it. 
CREASY - FROM SOMEONE'S POV 
Slightly sinister.   Watching from the frame of the door. 
LISA You've done much of this work before? 
CREASY Never. 
Samuel sells, covers for Creasy's reticence. 
SAMUEL He has experience in related work.     A great deal of it. 
LISA Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy? 
Creasy hesitates for an imperceptible beat. 
CREASY No.   I do not have family. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                          16. 
And then, somehow, Creasy is aware of being watched.        His eyes flicker over, just in time to see... 
PINTA 
Crouched low. In the doorway. She stares back at him a beat, then disappears around the corner. 
SITTING ROOM 
Creasy frowns.    Lisa steps over with Creasy's drink. 
CREASY Thank you. 
She makes a point of looking into his eyes. Creasy looks back into hers with complete indifference, something she has not experienced even from dying men. 
She abruptly turns away.    Confused for a moment. Finally: 
LISA Pinta! 
A few moments and Pinta arrives.       'Cool Hand Pinta'. 
PINTA Yes, mom? 
LISA This is Mr. Creasy. 
Pinta walks over and very formally holds out her hand. Creasy shakes it. An odd beat. 
LISA Pinta, show him to his room. 
Samuel reacts.    Creasy got the job. 
PINTA This way, Mr. Creasy. 
What an actress. As he follows her out.        Samuel sits at his baby grand and begins to play. 
LISA Well, think about going to sleep.   Good night, baby. 
Lisa exits.   Pinta looks over at the battered teddy bear. 
PINTA Just like you, a big old bear. 
CUT TO: 
CREASY 
In his room. Tests his mag spring with his thumb, begins loading up. The full magazine joins with those already loaded. 
Another glass of scotch is poured. 
Creasy's hands oil the holster. The Sig Sauer is slipped in. The holster is hung over the corner post of the bed. 
A map is flattened. Creasy's finger traces various routes, pencils them in. From the house to Pinta's school. 
The macaw squawks again. Creasy steps over, takes the cage and carries it to the open window. He opens the cage door. 
CREASY Now's your chance. 
The bird flies, disappears out the window. 
INT.   LISA & SAMUEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Spent, glistened in sweat, the couple lay side by side. 
LISA She likes him. 
SAMUEL Hmm? 
LISA Creasy.   Pinta likes him. 
SAMUEL Pinta loves school. She'd like Count Dracula is he took her back there. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   21. 
Lisa just smiles, knows her daughter better. 
CUT TO: 
CREASY'S ROOM 
Creasy's drinking in the dark next to the window, listening to the sounds of Mexico City at night. 
The empty scotch glass is set down.    Ominously sober. 
INT. PINTA'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 
Brushing her hair, Pinta wanders to the window at the sound of a car hood closing. Creasy is down below going over the car; a dark BLUE MERCEDES. As he checks underneath... 
The "Car Wash Guy", Pedro, trying to engage Creasy. Frank looks on, seems like he disapproves of Pedro. 
INT.   MERCEDES - DAY 
Creasy sits grimly behind the wheel. Pinta exuberant beside him. Traveling route number one from home base to school. Pinta looks at Creasy's hands on the wheel. The back of the right one is swirled with scars. 
PINTA Where are you from, Creasy? 
CREASY The United States. 
PINTA I know.    But which state? 
Creasy checks the rearview mirror. A banged up white TOYOTA COROLLA pulls out behind him. 
CREASY No state in particular. 
Pinta frowns; this is going to take some work. 
PINTA My mom and me are from Houston, Texas. Have you been there? 
Creasy has his eyes on the mirror. 
CREASY No. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   22. 
PINTA You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you? 
CREASY (turns left) No. 
PINTA Why not? 
CREASY I'm looking for potential. 
Creasy checks the mirror. The white Corolla continues the way it was going. False alarm. 
PINTA Potential?     I don't understand. 
CREASY Places where the road bends, places away from buildings, places where the traffic thins out. But you don't have to understand. I do. So no talking. 
PINTA Are you going to quit?     My last bodyguard quit. 
CREASY Let me guess, you wouldn't stop talking? 
PINTA Someone gave him more money than we could. 
CREASY I'm a bargain. 
PINTA Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico? 
CREASY Time will tell. 
PINTA There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy? 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     23. 
RAYBURN I've heard of it. Never happened to me though. Maybe the firing pin's off. 
CREASY Maybe... 
Creasy is troubled about it all to say the least. 
RAYBURN It's like we always used to say: a bullet always tells the truth. What were you shooting at? 
Creasy doesn't answer.    He holds the bullet up, looks at it. 
RAYBURN (focusing; concerned) Creasy? 
CREASY Sorry I woke you, Ray. 
Creasy clicks off the phone. He starts back toward the house, but stops short again. 
There she is. Pinta. Standing in the window of her room. She's been watching him. It's like Creasy seeing her for the first time. And she's been watching him forever. No easy answer for it. They're connected somehow. 
INT. CREASY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Fingers putting the special bullet into an old matchbox. It takes it place of honor front and center on the shrine. Next to the Marlboros and scotch. The New Testament is set down nearby. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                   33. 
CU - Creasy asleep in his bed for the first time. 
INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY 
Silent Creasy driving. Lisa and Pinta in the back. Creasy steals a look in the mirror. Pinta stares straight ahead. But when Creasy looks away, Pinta steals a look at him. 
EXT.   STREET - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
As the mercedes crosses an intersection, a white TOYOTA COROLLA turns right, pulls in thirty meters behind it. 
INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING - DAY 
Creasy clocks the Corolla, frowns. He pulls a piece of paper from his pocket. But nothing to write with. 
CREASY Pinta, do you have a pencil? 
PINTA I go to school, don't I? 
Sarcasm. He stays calm, doesn't let on what he's thinking. 
CREASY Please? 
Her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a pencil. Creasy takes it, slows to let the Corolla catch up. He squints into the mirror to read the plate. 
Lisa is oblivious, but as Pinta looks back over her shoulder... 
BRAKE LIGHTS up ahead. Creasy lurches to a stop.    The Corolla swerves around them disappears ahead. 
CREASY Sorry. 
LISA The traffic takes some getting used to. 
As Creasy cranes for a view, another WHITE Corolla comes by headed the opposite way. They're everywhere. This relaxes Creasy's paranoia. As he laughs to himself. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       34. 
EXT.   COURTYARD - CONVENT SCHOOL - DAY 
They pull in through the gates. The Mercedes parks; Creasy gets out. Pinta kisses her mother on the cheek. 
PINTA Bye, Mom. 
LISA Don't forget your towel. 
Pinta gets out with book bag and her      towel. As she starts to walk past Creasy without a      word, he holds out her pencil. She holds up, shows him       a SECOND PENCIL, continues on her way. Doesn't need       him. 
MERCEDES 
Creasy gets back in, starts away. 
LISA She has swimming practice today.    You'll need to pick her up at the pool. 
Creasy just nods. He doesn't want anything to do with Lisa either. Thoughtful, Lisa looks out the window. 
LISA I talked to her. She understands.     She won't bother you anymore. 
As Creasy just drives. 
EXT.   AGO'S - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
Creasy waits in the street, stands by the Mercedes. He checks his watch, looks around. The minutes do not pass quickly. He looks over as the restaurant door opens and Lisa exits with Jordan Kalfus and his Latin wife EVELYN. 
LISA (sees him) Creasy! (stepping over) Meet Jordan and Evelyn. 
Creasy nods.    They study him with interest. 
JORDAN So you're the bodyguard? (Creasy nods again) You used to be, what did they used to call it, a soldier of fortune? 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                 35. 
Jordan doesn't quite hide his disdain. Creasy nods a final time, lets his eyes drift to a 1000 yard stare. 
EVELYN (giggles) Does he talk? 
As Lisa gives her a dirty look, Evelyn whispers... 
EVELYN He's sexy... 
Jordan looks in the direction Creasy looks. 
JORDAN You see any danger out there? (laughs) The fear's worse than the reality. 
Just a blankness from Creasy. 
PINTA You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead. 
SAMUEL You enjoy it for us, Pinta. 
Lisa gives her a look. Don't make this harder than it has to be. Finally, Pinta nods. 
Creasy waits quite a discreet distance away by the Mercedes. She steps over, stops to wave goodbye one last time, then gets in back. As Creasy shuts the door. 
INT.   MERCEDES - MEXICO CITY ROAD - DAY 
Creasy drives, glances in the mirror at Pinta in the back seat. She wipes away a tear just as it forms. 
CREASY They'll be back in a week. 
PINTA They can stay for two weeks.   I don't care. 
She's got a toughness Creasy likes.   As she looks out the window, he looks ahead. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       39. 
INT.   KITCHEN - RAMOS VILLA - DAY 
Creasy eats. 
CREASY The food is excellent, Maria.     You have a real talent. 
Maria beams with pleasure. 
MARIA My pleasure, Creasy. 
Pinta enters  in a RED SATIN DEVIL'S OUTFIT. She looks a bit forlorn  as she sits at opposite ends of the table from Creasy.   As she stares at her plate, Creasy starts to laugh at  what an odd sight she is. All dressed up and no place to  go. 
Wrong move. Pinta stands, marches out of the room.        As Maria and Creasy exchange a look... 
EXT./INT.   WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY 
Pinta the devil stares sadly out here window. Then there it is! The macaw. Sitting on the opposite roof. 
EXT.   ATTIC WINDOW - RAMOS VILLA - DAY 
Pinta pushes it open, climbs out onto the slope of the roof. This doesn't look like such a good idea. As she crosses, disappears over the peak. 
It's a game of catch me if you can. 'Bird' looks at Pinta right in the eye. She gingerly moves closer. The bird moves away, just out of her reach each time. 
CHIMNEY 
Pinta coming down the other slope.      There's the macaw. 
PINTA Come on.   Come on.   Bird! 
The fourth time Pinta's fingers are centimeters away. She reaches and suddenly slides along the slick tile covering this section of the roof. Frank's in the yard barking loudly. 
Near the edge, she manages to stop.      Whew! 
She scrambles up a few feet. A tile snaps off. She slides again. This time right off the edge. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      40. 
She catches the rain gutter. Hangs thirty feet above the ground. A concrete landing below. As the gutter creaks: 
INT.   KITCHEN - DAY 
PINTA'S VOICE CREASY! 
Creasy is on his feet, out the door in a heartbeat. 
EXT.   SIDE YARD - DAY 
Creasy dashes around just as the gutter drops on one side. Pinta drops ten feet, jerks to a stop as the gutter stops, then drops the last twenty feet... 
...landing in a hedge.   Creasy dashes over. 
CREASY Pinta! 
She's in a lot of pain, but moving her arms and head. Frank's licking her face. 
PINTA It hurts. 
CREASY Where? 
PINTA (Short) Everywhere! 
She puts her hands to the left side of her ribs.     Creasy carefully probes with his fingers. She winces. 
CREASY I don't think they're broken.     Anywhere else? 
PINTA My ankle. 
As Maria huffs and puffs her way up. 
CREASY I'm going to get you out, okay? 
Pinta nods. Creasy eases his arms under, around her, lifts her out as gently as possible. She disappears in his arms. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     41. 
PINTA Oh, Creasy... 
And she bursts into tears. Maria looks up at the thirty foot fall. Begins to cross herself. 
CREASY It's okay.    She's just scared. 
Creasy cradles her, pats her back.      As Pinta says his name like a mantra... 
INT.   HOTEL ROOM - DETROIT - NIGHT 
Lisa on the phone. Fantastic in a black evening dress. The Ford car industry dinner awaits her entrance. 
PINTA It must be difficult having lots of wives. 
CREASY You feel sorry for the husband? 
PINTA (in Spanish) Yeah. Can you imagine my mother multiplied by a thousand? 
Maria and Gomez burst out laughing. So funny that Creasy smiles. Pinta lights up at the sight. A huge victory. 
PINTA Creasy, you're smiling. 
He reverts to a frown. Now Pinta bursts out laughing. And Creasy can't help but smile again. 
CREASY I guess I am. 
Pinta changes subject. 
PINTA So how come you know so much about those countries? 
CREASY I had to do my homework on them when I worked there. Also I enjoy history. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  45. 
PINTA What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes? 
CREASY No, that was in Columbia. 
CUT TO: 
GOMEZ 
Humming to himself as he brushes the leaves out of the empty SWIMMING POOL. 
CUT TO: 
CU of a water faucet unloads 100 gallons a minute. 
A MAN'S HAND.   BLACK. 
Raises up against the blue sky. Like a kid playing Cowboys and Indians. The finger pulls an imaginary trigger. 
RAMOS POOL 
In her swimsuit and cap, Pinta crouches in makeshift starting blocks. 
CREASY Bang! 
Pinta takes off. Splashes into the water.     Not to Creasy's satisfaction. 
CREASY No, no, come back. 
Pinta turns in the water, looks back at him. 
CREASY You don't flinch when a gun goes off; you react. You go. Don't listen for the sound; don't anticipate it. Concentrate on the sound itself. 
PINTA I don't understand. 
CREASY Don't worry.    You will. 
Creasy points at the blocks.    Pinta gets out of the water. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  46. 
Shivering, Creasy throws a towel around her and rubs her down. 
INT.   MERCEDES - ROLLING 
On the way to school. Pinta is stealing looks at Creasy's right hand. She knows the answer must be serious, but she has to ask. 
PINTA Creasy, what happened to your hand? 
Creasy looks at her a moment, deciding. Pinta practically holds her breath, watches him, knows the answer may come. Creasy checks the mirror, watches the road. 
CREASY A man asked me questions once.   He smoked a lot. There was no ashtray. 
That's it. End of explanation. Creasy continues watching the road. Pinta watches him. 
CREASY Remember you asked me what state I was from? 
PINTA Yes. 
CREASY Where you're from isn't so much about geography; it's about events. Where you're from is what happened to you. 
PINTA Good things happen, too, Creasy. (smiles big) Like meeting me. 
CREASY (after a beat) I guess that really does make me a hard case. 
As the two of them share a LAUGH... 
INT.   3RD FLOOR HALLWAY - RAMOS VILLA - NIGHT 
Lisa walking toward Creasy's room. As she moves to knock, she sees the door is ajar, hears voices. She peeks in. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     47. 
Creasy and Pinta sit on the floor, pencils, papers and a book spread out before them. Doing her history homework. 
LISA'S POV - OF CREASY 
He's charming and great with Pinta.     And sexy... Evelyn was right. 
PINTA Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy? 
CREASY No. 
PINTA Did you used to? 
CREASY Yeah.   Two or three. 
CREASY I hung up on him. When I met Alicia, I got it. 
Alicia blows Creasy a kiss. 
CREASY Can I kiss her now, or after you've gone to bed? 
Laughter. 
PINTA Okay, I think now is as good as time as any. 
She takes out a velvet pouch from her pocket. She holds it out to Creasy. He looks at her, takes it from her hand. His thick fingers fumble with a delicate drawstring. 
Pinta waits for his reaction as Creasy pours a simple, but fine MEDALLION and chain into the palm of his hand. 
PINTA I bought it with my own money.     I saved it. 
Creasy is really affected, tries to hide it.    She takes it, slips it over his head. 
PINTA It's St. Jude, the patron saint of lost causes. 
RAYBURN And hard cases. Creasy's the reason St. Jude became a Saint in the first place. 
PINTA Yeah, that's right. 
Creasy looks at it, considers. 
CREASY Thank you, Pinta, it's beautiful. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  57. 
Pinta kisses him. As the Mariachi band drifts over, Rayburn grabs his wife by the hand. 
RAYBURN Come on, baby. I feel like a third wheel. Watch the kid. 
They dance. A waiter steps over, refills Creasy's water glass. As he drinks... 
PINTA Could I ask you a question? 
CREASY Could I stop you? 
PINTA You don't drink like you used to. 
CREASY That's not a question. 
PINTA I know because I go in your room and check the bottles. 
CREASY Still not a question. 
PINTA My mom drinks, too...    Why do people drink, Creasy? 
CREASY Now that's a question. I don't know about your Mom. For me, the problem isn't in the glass. The problem's in between my ears. 
PINTA You think too much? 
CREASY Yeah. Because at one time, I didn't think enough. 
Pinta nods, thinks she understands. 
INT.   AIRPORT - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
Samuel and Lisa on the moving escalator. Home from Los Angeles. They look down through the glass, see Creasy waiting for them below. And finally, Lisa frowns. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      58. 
LISA He has to go, Samuel. 
SAMUEL What?   Who? 
LISA Creasy. 
SAMUEL Why?    You were so pleased with him. 
LISA Pinta likes him too much. (a beat) She thinks of him as a father. 
SAMUEL That's ridiculous. 
LISA It's not. 
Samuel thinks about it, is almost apologetic. 
SAMUEL I've just been so busy, Lisa. 
LISA He has to go. 
Samuel looks at her, wonders at her adamancy. 
SAMUEL The three month trial ends in a week. I just won't confirm the position. That possibility was understood when I hired him. 
Lisa gives him a look. She wants it done today.     But for once, Samuel is stronger than his wife. 
SAMUEL I won't create bad feelings. And another week won't make a difference. 
Off the escalator, they turn toward Creasy waiting unaware. 
SAMUEL It will be a hard break. 
LISA She's young.     She'll get over it. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    59. 
SAMUEL I wasn't thinking of Pinta. 
As Lisa looks over at Samuel, he's reaching out his hand, smiling big. 
SAMUEL Creasy, how are you? 
As they shake hands... 
Slides to a stop in front of Pinta, blocking her path to Creasy. And as TWO MEN leap out from the backseat... 
CREASY (drawing his 9mm) Run, Pinta, run! 
But she's rooted with fear. 
And the men are almost on her. 
Creasy raises the 9mm overhead.    BANG! 
And the sound frees her.   Pinta runs! 
Ducking under a flailing arm.    Quick and lithe.   Trying to reach her bodyguard. 
The cops drawing Uzi's.. 
Creasy plants himself, the Sig Sauer now level.     He fires twice into COP ONE, dead center in the chest. 
Pinta runs.   Chased by the TWO MEN. 
COP TWO returns fire wildly: the Mercedes hit in a ten bullet line. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                        63. 
Creasy fires two more rounds into COP TWO who's hit high in the chest and throat. Precise. 
Creasy pivots, strides calmly forward, firing at the men chasing Pinta. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! 
MAN ONE goes down, hit in the ribs. 
A bullet slams Creasy in the back, fired from inside the Corolla. 
Creasy fires back.    BOOM!    BOOM! 
MAN THREE falls dead, hit just below his nose, just above his teeth. The FAT DRIVER fires, now, and Creasy is hit in the shoulder. 
And Pinta disappears into the traffic.        Gone. 
MAN TWO, who has abandoned chasing Pinta, fires again. 
Creasy drops the 9mm as he is hit in the stomach.      He falls to his knees. 
The dandelion starts to come apart.      Drifting away, piece by piece. 
Slack-jawed, Creasy looks about. Sees the FAT DRIVER heaving himself out of the Corolla while MAN TWO scans for Pinta who's nowhere in sight. 
She got away!   Creasy smiles even as he crumples over on his side. 
PINTA'S VOICE CREASY! 
And Pinta is back. Running toward Creasy. She can't leave him like this. She was safe and now she's back. 
CREASY NOOO... 
She runs to him, wraps her arms around him. 
PINTA Creasy... 
MAN TWO catches up, tears Pinta away, starts back for the sedan. Creasy can only blink after them. 
PINTA Creasy! 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       64. 
It's not a cry for help.     It's anguish for him. 
CREASY Pinta... 
MAN TWO crams her in the back seat, follows. The fat driver gets back in behind the wheel. As the door slams shut, wheels spin, grip and the Corolla accelerates away. 
We just see Pinta look back through the rear windshield. An anguished image before she's pulled back down. 
Creasy makes a wish.     Not for himself, but for her. 
CREASY Don't die, Creasy, don't die. 
And everything goes very, very, 
BLACK 
Sound breaks through first. The whir and beep of medical equipment. And we fade back into: 
INT.    HOSPITAL ROOM - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
Creasy hooked up. Tubes running in and out of the unconscious man. And he's suddenly surrounded. 
The CHIEF of the Judicial Police and several uniformed OFFICERS. At the foot of the bed several NEWSPAPER REPORTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS. 
CHIEF This man, Senor Robert Creasy, an American citizen, is under arrest for the murder of two police officers, Hector Gonzalez and Pablo Lunara. He is also the prime suspect in the kidnapping of Pinta Martin Ramos. 
One of the officers props up Creasy's head.     The chief puffs his chest out and flashes flash.

Rayburn swallows his anger, starts fishing for his wallet. Suddenly, the thugs snap to attention. Manzano is on the way down followed by ADJUTANT and TWO PLAINCLOTHES. 
Ignoring the proffered salutes, Manzano finishes his pastry, licks his fingertips as he regards Rayburn. 
MANZANO When I heard it was this hospital I was so pleased. There's a pastry shop nearby. Delgado's. Do you know it? 
Rayburn shakes his head. 
MANZANO The best pastries in Mexico. 
Manzano holds out his right hand. 
MANZANO (CONT'D) Miguel Manzano.

Creasy out of it still.    Rayburn and Manzano at the foot of the bed. 
RAYBURN He's not a cop killer. 
MANZANO I'm sure he isn't. Though he's certainly adept at killing. 
RAYBURN He was doing his job, protecting the girl. If police were involved, you figure it out. I'm here for him. 
MANZANO So am I. 
And Creasy stirs.   Rayburn leans into his friend, Manzano just behind him. 
RAYBURN You hear me, Crease? 
Creasy's eyes slit open. 
RAYBURN (CONT'D) (whispers) You got three of the fuckers.   All dead.

CREASY I need less than standard packing. Can you knock up a case for fifteen of each? 
He picks up a double barrel shotgun, checks the line of it. He flicks open the breach, snaps it shut.

Manzano, Rosanna, and technicians are listening to voice analysis tapes of various kidnappers. They're struggling. Rosanna hands the piece of paper with the license plate number to Manzano. 
MANZANO He'll die of his wounds; bleed to death before he can do anything. 
ROSANNA He sounded strong to me.      Stronger than we are. 
Rosanna pauses. 
ROSANNA Because he's outside. Because he's not tied to the same system we are. 
MANZANO We did voice analysis of the last five high profile kidnappings, including the little girl. The same man 'The Dreamer'. Listen to this. 
Manzano plays back a recording of the Kidnapper. 
VOICE "I used to run through the streets of Neza because I was scared of being fucked with. I swore one day I would cross the street walking. Now I walk." 
ROSANNA He's protected by La Hermanidad.

MANZANO It's a moral issue. On one hand you're cleaning up the bad guys, but in another way we are feeding the problem that produces bad guys.

CREASY Who's he? 
JORGE I don't know, but I know his face. 
Creasy cocks the trigger. 
JORGE I see him sometimes at the handball court in Chapultepec on a Saturday afternoon.

SANDRI (Italian Immigrant) 
Putting his cufflinks through his shirt sleeves. Wearing a shoulder holster. A satisfied smile as he looks back into the room. At the bed. A 17-year-old GIRL under the sheet. 
GIRL (nods) When will I see you again? 
Pulling  on his suit coat, Sandri steps to the door. He mimes a  pistol action with his forefinger and thumb. He opens it  to find himself staring square into the eyes of Creasy.   He rests the twin barrels of the sawed-off shotgun  square against Sandri's chest. 
CREASY Her name was Pinta.

CREASY I'm not here to hurt you. I need to borrow your house and your car. Are you the proud owners of the Coupe deVille? 
EXT.   JUDICIAL COMPOUND - MORNING 
A military operation as Tazinari is led out to his car. Two heavy gray sedans wait. Tazinari gets in the back of the second car with his AIDE-DE-CAMP. The door is shut behind them. 
MERCEDES 
The door closes with an hermetic whump. The two cars pull away toward the opening FRONT GATES.

INT.   GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY 
Creasy has just finished taping the old couple to two chairs. 
CREASY If you promise to speak softly and not to shout, I won't have to tape your mouths. 
The old man looks to his wife, then back to Creasy. Nods. 
The old man watches as Creasy opens he canvas bag, pulls out two metal tubes that he screws together. It's a ROCKET LAUNCHER. Next he pulls out a cone-shaped missile. The old man is starting to look curious. 
CREASY Did you know you have a dishonest policeman living in your neighborhood? 
Creasy depresses the fins on the missile and slides it back into the tube. 
OLD MAN I know of you. You're the American. The bodyguard who's killing the kidnapper. 
Creasy doesn't answer, steps into the center of the room. 
OLD MAN In the church, they say to forgive. 
CREASY Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting. 
Creasy looks back and forth between two shuttered windows and in a line to the wall with a household Catholic alter. Christ on the cross sits front and center. 
CREASY Do you have an old blanket you don't care about? I don't want to burn that wall. 
INT.   GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT - DAY 
A figure rises, framed in the window. 
And Pinta stands beside him.   As she puts her fingers in her ears... 
Creasy looks back over his shoulder, but of course she's not there. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                      103. 
Creasy fires the rocket launcher. A gout of flame erupts from the back. But Creasy has hung a blanket on the wall. 
INT.   LEAD CAR - DAY 
Eyes widening as the first rocket streaks toward them. The driver stands on the brakes. The car explodes, is obliterated really, from the inside out. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Tazinari's car slams into the debris of the lead car and slides sideways against a wall wedging it in. Real tight. 
CUT TO: 
CREASY 
A 'Man On Fire' strides through the smoke and dust. A shotgun at his side and a Molotov cocktail in his left hand. 
Without missing  a stride he unloads both barrels into the drivers window.   A scary prospect even though it's bullet- proof. The lit   Molotov explodes beneath the car. Silence. Then a   dull impact explosion. 30 feet of flames envelope  the car. The driver and Tazinari both prisoners inside  their own car. 
Relief for Tazinari as the .44 Is withdrawn. Creasy walks around the car Tazinari now looking like a naked hood ornament. Butt first.

EXT. FREEWAY EMERGENCY OFF RAMP - DAY 
Average speed 80 m.p.h. This is Mexico. Creasy slips the clutch, jumps out, and the Coup deVille kangaroos forward down the ramp. Gathering momentum into the oncoming traffic. Tazinari screams right on impact. 
INT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT 'KNOCK OFF' - MEXICO CITY 
Flambouyant, beautiful 16-year-old boy with a black eye and bloody nose. Jordan's boyfriend. Terrified and in tears runs down the hallway. Creasy following.

INT. SWIMMING POOL - DAY 
A huge maroon cloud covers the center of the pool. In the middle of the cloud is Jordan face down floating on the surface dressed in his beige linen suit. 
UNDERWATER 
CLOSE UP of Jordan face down. We glimpse what we don't want to see. Black holes where his eyes and mouth were. His ears missing. 
Creasy not terribly impressed.   Just pissed that he's late. 
Creasy on a cell phone talking to Rosanna 
CREASY Another favor... get me banking info on Jordan Kalfus. U.S. deposits or withdrawals. Thanks. Oh, get me the same on Samuel Ramos. 
ROSANNA How do I contact you?   We still don't have the ATM info. 
CREASY You don't, I'll call you. Oh! I have a tape recording that I am sure will interest you. 
EXT. MUNICIPAL POOL - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
Creasy doing laps. He swims the last few meters underwater. As he surfaces, Pinta waits by the edge. She nods in grim satisfaction. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                  108. 
He isn't doing well. The cloud of deep red emanating from his stomach envelopes his whole body. 
INT.   DINING ROOM - EVENING 
Samuel eats dinner silently. Lisa just stares into space, nursing a vodka. Even great marriages cannot survive the trauma of kidnapping and subsequent death. 
The door opens and they expect to see Maria with the deserts. Creasy enters and sits at the table like a dinner guest. 
CREASY (to Samuel) I'm going to talk to your wife. If you move or say one word, I'll kill you. 
He takes a Colt Officer model .45 semi-automatic pistol out of his waistband and lays it on the table in preparation for something, we don't know what. He turns to Lisa. 
CREASY I'm going to tell you a story. Your lawyer is dead. Someone didn't want him talking. Last week he wired $2.5 million into his U.S. bank account. Colonel Ernesto Tazinari is also dead. He hijacked the ransom drop, another $2.5 million. If my arithmetic is correct it means $5 million remains. 
Creasy looks to Samuel. 
CREASY Your husband magically had five million deposited in a U.S. bank account last Friday. 
Lisa's eyes never leave Creasy's...trying to discern whether this is true or not. 
CREASY They planned it, Samuel and Kalfus. 
LISA Planned what? 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                     109. 
CREASY An autosequestra. Kalfus arranged for Pinta to be taken to a safehouse. I'm sure he thought she'd sit there for three days eating pizza and watching TV. It didn't work out that way. Everything got fucked up when I killed the cops and Tazinari saw an opportunity. 
Lisa screams.   Creasy gestures with a finger to his lips. 
CREASY On the surface it was low risk and high return. This was the third autosequestra Jordan had organized for clients. The other two succeeded. 
Samuel looks to Lisa. 
SAMUEL Our lifestyle was in jeopardy. My pain and weakness only fueled your anger and determination. I wasn't sure about whether to go through with it or not. Then I woke up one day and it was done. (beat) Jordan was supposed to take care of it. 
Through all of the above, Creasy removes the special bullet held in the seam of his wallet. The misfire.     He empties the other cartridges from his gun. 
Lisa suddenly attacks Samuel in a violent, emotional outburst of tears, screaming, and rage. Drawing blood from his nose and upper lip. Samuel smothers Lisa's arms beneath his. He appears strong and decisive for the first time. 
Creasy very carefully takes the bullet, puts it into the magazine and chambers the round. He looks into Samuel's eyes. 
CREASY A bullet does not lie. A bullet tells the truth. And the truth will set you free. 
Creasy hands Samuel the gun. 
CREASY In many ways I think this bullet should be shared between you and Lisa. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                    110. 
Creasy exits the room. Samuel kisses Lisa on the forehead and exits onto the terrace. 
A GUNSHOT. 
INT.   DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Lisa just sits.    Where will she find air to breathe? 
EXT.   MEXICO CITY - NIGHT 
Life moves on with its brutal inevitability.    This is a river whose course cannot be altered. 
PINTA'S VOICE From the backseat I can see   Creasy's eyes in the mirror. He watches    and thinks. He never smiles. I wish I    was back in the front seat with him. I    wish he would smile. 
Creasy looks up from the notebook and out at the city. And a smile comes. But it's bitter and hopeless. 
It's half grief, half not knowing where to go next, what to do. And he's dying. He knows that too. Creasy dials a number on a cell phone. 
CREASY Hola... 
CREASY Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death? 
Manzano laughs again.   Genuine.   Creasy cracks him up. 
MANZANO My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works. 
CREASY So you are going to talk me to death. 
MANZANO You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be. (another laugh, then a beat) The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want. 
CREASY Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want? 
MANZANO I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing. 
CREASY My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking? 
MANZANO No, but I have to admit I thought about it. 
CREASY Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address. 
Work in Progress 2/10/03                                       115. 
MANZANO You have no interest in making things easy, do you? 
CREASY I'm not... easy. 
Manzano reaches into his pocket. He pulls out a folded PIECE OF PAPER and a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE. He hands the bottle out first. 
MANZANO Percodan.   I imagine you need handfuls by now. 
Creasy makes no move to take it. Manzano sighs, sets it down in front of him. Regarding the paper... 
MANZANO Account belongs to a woman we think is The Dreamer's girlfriend. Reina Rosas, who is 8 months pregnant. 
Creasy holds his hand out.     Manzano hesitates. 
MANZANO The plan is the girlfriend will lead you to the Boss. You'll lead me, and I'll arrest him. Agreed? 
Creasy doesn't respond. Finally Manzano gives him the paper, a mimeographed mugshot, and address scrawled on it. Creasy stands. As he scoops up the pills. Creasy starts out. 
MANZANO Creasy... (Creasy turns) I'd have liked to have known you under different circumstances. 
CREASY Off the top of my head, I don't know what they could've been. 
As Creasy departs... 
FADE TO BLACK.

EXT.   ROCK WALL HOUSE - MEXICO CITY - DAY 
A tiered house built into the rock face that runs through Mexico City. A scooter is parked. A man sits on it waiting, wearing a crash helmet to hide his now well known features. Creasy. 
CREASY - VIDEO FEED 
It's difficult to say where they are coming from. The view passes from one screen to another. As Creasy's passes, we hear the whispered crackle of radio communications. 
GROUND LEVEL 
CREASY sits up as a car pulls up, and a MAN gets out. Creasy checks the digital "8x10" even though this face is indelibly imprinted on his brain. 
It's not "The Dreamer."    Not as handsome, but there's a resemblance. 
The MAN unlocks the front door, checks the street first and then enters. 
Creasy regroups mentally and physically. Checks the magazine in his SIG SAUER. Chambers rounds into his shotgun. Looks up and sees a six-year-old on a bicycle approach the front door. A ten-year-old opens the door from inside. The six-year-old struggles to get his bicycle through the doorway. 
Creasy moves. He holds the shotgun against his leg as he strides across the street. "Man on Fire." 
The bicycle makes it in.    And the door is closing... 
Creasy gets a foot in, forces his way inside.

Manzano listens to a radio over a desk speaker. 
VOICE He's inside.    What should we do?

INT.   HALLWAY - DAY 
The pregnant woman, Reina Rosas, SCREAMING BLOODY MURDER as Creasy fills the space behind her. Creasy follows as she runs. 
LIVING ROOM 
Creasy faces Reina, heavily pregnant. Silence. Two other kids hide behind her. Suddenly the wall next to Creasy explodes in a hail of bullets. 
We realize Creasy caught one round in the chest. He's down on one knee... uses the shotgun as a crutch. Reina is screaming. 
Hear a door torn open. Creasy      moves to the sound.   A MAN has run out the back...

Cell phone ringing. 
CREASY Yeah. 
Daniel has a different attitude, a lot more amenable.     He tries to speak to Creasy very logically about a very illogical subject.

CREASY I want you.

Holding the shotgun with his right hand, Creasy holds the phone to Aurillio's ear. 
AURILLIO Daniel? 
BOOM! Creasy shoots Aurillio in his right kneecap.      As Aurillio HOWLS in agony... 
CREASY Listen to me. Listen! I'm going to take your family apart piece by piece. 
The line goes dead.    Hang up.   Creasy's ready to explode. 
REINA Under the sink. We have money under the sink. Six million dollars. It's wet but good.

Aurillio moans on the floor. Reina says the rosary. The kids cry. The phone rings. Creasy listens, not capable of speaking. 
DANIEL Creasy.   She calls the bear 'Creasy Bear.' 
Time stands still for Creasy.        Words evaporate.    Liquid film in Creasy's eyes.

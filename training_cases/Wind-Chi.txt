1   INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - DAY                              1 
A GIRL'S FACE 
fills the screen, twenty-one years old, pensive, pretty. 
Camera lingers on her in CLOSE UP, noticing details: hair worn stylishly messy, no makeup, double-pierced ears (though no earrings today), the corner of her bottom lip a little frayed where she's been chewing it ruminatively. 
She's the kind of beauty who can withstand such bad lighting: institutional lighting, florescents HUMMING overhead, joining the chorus of ambient noises: a COUGH, papers RUSTLING, the SCRIBBLE of a pen, someone SHIFTING in their chair, etc. The shot lingers until it becomes uncomfortable, invasive, scrutinizing this unhappy girl in an unguarded moment, then - 
A new sound breaks her reverie, a muted BUZZING o.s., and her eyes cut down to - 
HER CELLPHONE 
skittering sideways across the closed cover of her blue final exam book, like a bug. She has an INCOMING TEXT MESSAGE. 
WIDEN TO REVEAL: 
2   INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - ESTABLISHING - DAY               2 
Our GIRL is just one of two hundred other STUDENTS filling a big auditorium-style lecture hall. Around her, classmates sit grim-faced, scribbling to beat the clock. 
BACK TO: 
OUR GIRL traps the buzzing cellphone before it skitters right off the edge of the half-desk, looks at the display. 
INSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY - 
u done?! 
BACK TO SCENE 
Our girl leans back a little in her seat, gives a little nod to her friend seated across the lecture hall. Types a reply.

INTERCUT: CELL PHONE DISPLAY / OUR GIRL 
She looks down as her friend text-messages: 
how r u getting home? Typing. 
bus She sends the message, a moment later the reply appears: 
sux 4 U She glances up, sees her friend shoot her a sympathetic look. 
PROCTOR (O.S.) That's it, people! Wrap it up! 
There's a collective GROAN and the sound of two hundred panicked asses twisting in their seats. 
Our girl feels her phone buzz, looks down to see a final text message from her friend: 
y don't u check the ride board? A slow smile lights up her face at the idea, as all around her students rise and begin stampeding out. 
PROCTOR (O.S.) (cont'd) (shouting to be heard) Test results will be posted on the Philosophy Department's web site in two weeks... Enjoy your break and have a Happy New Year. 
She gathers her things, begins to make her way down the stairs when - 
GIRL Hey! 
- she's JOSTLED from behind by a CLASSMATE bolting past her. 
She hands in her exam book, waves to her friend, and exits.

3   EXT. NEW ENGLAND UNIVERSITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY               3 
Campus is a ghost town, most students having already left for the holidays: the DORMS abandoned, the LIBRARY STACKS empty, the LABS silent, the DINING HALLS eerie. 
Our GIRL hurries across the deserted college green dotted with little hillocks of snow from an earlier storm. She passes a forlorn pine tree decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, on her way to... 
4   EXT. UNIVERSITY - QUAD - DAY                                    4 
She arrives at a large, partially-enclosed KIOSK covered with dozens of student-made notices, printed in a rainbow of eye- catching computer fonts and colors. A sign at the top reads: RIDE BOARD. 
7        EXT. UNIVERSITY - STUDENT PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT             7 
As they drive off, reveal: a forgotten bag of GROCERIES, still sitting on the ground.

They leave campus.   He eavesdrops as she rattles on. 
GIRL (on her cell) Where are you? (listens) No, we're just rolling out... (listens) ... Believe me, I tried, but I couldn't get a flight. It's my own fault for waiting `til the last minute...

11   INT./EXT. OLDSMOBILE - DUSK                                   11 
She looks out at the passing landscape as they cruise south on the interstate. The road is wet, though the snow hasn't yet started to stick. 
GIRL (laughs; on her cell) What, are you kidding? I'm bored to tears... No, we're still on the highway... how should I know, all highways look exactly alike. 
She looks up, catches him shooting irritated looks her way. 
GIRL (cont'd) What? 
GUY You going to be on that thing the whole- 
He doesn't finish the thought, just chokes back whatever he was about to say. Focuses on the highway ahead.

GIRL (on her cell) Uh oh, somebody's upset. I better call you back. (pause) Who do you think? Ride Board Guy. Okay, `bye. 
She hangs up, aims the camera phone lens his way, and snaps another digital picture of him. 
She puts the cellphone away, looks up to see him glaring at her. 
GIRL (cont'd) What? 
GUY (blurting) This isn't cool. If I have to drive, you have to talk to me. 
GIRL What, I'm the in-flight entertainment? 
GUY That's how this ride-sharing thing works. Division of labor. We split everything fifty-fifty... Get it? 
GIRL I've got news for you, I don't get much more entertaining than when I'm on the phone. 
He darkens, mutters under his breath: 
GUY (sarcastic) This is turning out great. 
GIRL What's that mean? 
GUY Forget it. 
They ride in silence for a moment. She tries to strike up a conversation, by way of extending an olive branch.

GIRL So you're from Wilmington, huh? 
GUY Yeah. 
GIRL Where'd you go to school? 
GUY (falters for a second) Um... Saint Vitus Academy. 
GIRL St. Vitus? You're making that up. 
GUY You're acquainted with every school in the area? 
GIRL Pretty much, yeah. 
GUY Including all the Catholic ones? Because that's where I went. Saint Vitus Academy for Catholic Boys. 
GIRL Okay, fine... 
They drive for a few moments in silence. 
GUY We had a class together, you know. 
GIRL Huh? 
GUY Intro to Modern Philosophy. 
GIRL They use a laser. 
GUY Well, yeah, they do... But there's definitely peeling involved too. I saw it on Discovery Health. If more people knew about the peeling part they might think twice before going under the knife. 
GIRL Laser. 
GUY Right, laser. 
GIRL I'm having corrective eye surgery over the break.

GUY Oh. 
An awkward beat. 
GIRL It's okay. I'm not really worried. 
GUY Why? 
GIRL I'm not worried? 
GUY You're getting it done... 
GIRL Because I hate wearing glasses. 
GUY But they look good on you. 
She frowns. 
GIRL How do you know? I don't wear them outside my dorm. 
He gets a cornered look. 
GUY You sure? You never... to class or anything? Because I could swear I- 
GIRL Never. 
GUY Huh. Weird. I wonder why I thought- 
He breaks off, saved by the sight of a gas station up ahead. 
GUY (cont'd) Hey, look! Here's your gas station! 
She looks at him across the dark front seat, suspicious.

14   EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - NIGHT                                14 
A florescent oasis in the gathering dark. A tow truck and several old wrecks rusting in the weeds surrounding it. 
The Oldsmobile pulls off the highway and up to a gas pump. 
15   EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - GAS PUMP / OLDSMOBILE - MINUTES      15 LATER 
He starts the pump.   Notices her still seated in the car. 
He knocks on her window.    She opens the door. 
GUY I thought you had to pee? 
GIRL I didn't expect us to find a bathroom so soon. My nails aren't dry. 
GUY Oh. 
He looks over the roof of the car, sizing up the distance across the slushy parking lot. 
GUY (cont'd) Well if you want, I can carry you. 
GIRL That's okay, they'll be dry in just a second. 
GUY Come on, I'm good at this... 
GIRL You are not carrying me inside. 
He opens her door, pulls her legs around, and crouches down between them. 
GUY Hold on. 
GIRL What are you doing?! Wait -

AT THE COUNTER: 
She strides up as the guy pays for the gas and a couple bottles of water. 
GIRL Didn't you hear me banging in there? 
GUY (startled; puzzled smile) When? 
GIRL You think it's funny? Me locked in? 
GUY Locked in where? 
GIRL You're telling me you didn't just hear me banging on the door? 
GUY I don't know what you're- 
GIRL (cuts him off) Forget it. Let's just get on the road. 
He gathers up the bottled water, heads toward the door.    The clerk calls to him: 
CLERK Remember, highway's your best bet- 
GUY (dismissive) Don't worry about it man, I got it all covered. 
She frowns, following him to the exit.

GIRL Are we lost or something? 
GUY (quickly) No, I've made this drive a million times. 
He holds the door for her, then follows her outside. 
19   EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - CONTINUOUS                         19 
As they exit and start toward the car she offers him a twenty. He looks at the money, as if he's never seen U.S. currency before. 
GUY What's that for? 
GIRL My half of the gas. 
GUY Keep it. 
GIRL What do you mean? Isn't that how ride-sharing works? -- We split everything fifty-fifty? 
GUY I don't take money from friends. 
Since when are they friends? 
They separate, walking around to their respective sides of the car. She tries the passenger door handle, only to find it stuck.

She rolls her eyes, waits for him to open it from the inside.

21   INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                          21 
She stares out at the road ahead, lulled by the sound of the windshield wipers sweeping snowflakes from side to side. 
HER POV: 
A nondescript exit comes up fast for a side road. Which wouldn't be cause for alarm or even interest except- 
He suddenly turns the wheel sharply, taking the exit. 
22   EXT. OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT                                    22 
The car veers off the interstate onto a much smaller two-lane road marked with a simple sign, paint-on-wood, faded to illegibility: Scenic Route 606. 
The tires crunch across an old chain which had once prevented access to the road but is now half-buried in the snow. 
Attached to it is a diamond-shaped warning sign of a more modern vintage reading: Rough Road. 
23   INT. OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT                                    23 
She falls against him, bracing herself against the dash. 
GIRL What the hell are you doing!? 
GUY Scenic detour. 
GUY Asshole who ran us off the road. 
She's completely forgotten all about the other vehicle until now. She turns to look, puzzled. 
There's no sign of the other vehicle anywhere. They're alone. 
GIRL I don't know. I guess maybe he decided just to hit and run. 
GUY So where are his tire tracks? 
She looks, sees an unbroken expanse of fresh white snow. 
GIRL In case you haven't noticed, it's coming down pretty hard. 
GUY (points) Yeah, but you can still see our tracks. 
The mystery of the missing tracks seems to have penetrated his post-accident fog, bringing him back into sharper focus. 
She watches as he walks out in front of the Olds' headlights to the middle of the road, where the other vehicles track's should be. 
GUY (cont'd) What the hell?! 
He walks back to the Olds and opens the passenger door (the only access into or out of the stranded car, thanks to the snowbank). He begins searching the glove compartment for a flashlight.

ANGLE ON HER 
Deliberating whether to seize this moment of distraction to make a break for it. 
She looks back down the long dark road. 
Looks back at him bent over rummaging in the Oldsmobile. 
Too risky. 
Curiosity getting the better of her, she walks out to the middle of the road to have a look for herself. 
No tracks. 
Just an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints. 
GIRL (to herself) This doesn't make any sense... 
At that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight. He spokes it, sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings. 
The left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep even the flashlight's beam can't penetrate it. A precipice. 
He cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs. 
GUY (calling) HELLO! 
She jumps at the sound of his voice, her nerves frazzled. 
GUY (cont'd) (calling) ANYBODY OUT THERE!? ANYONE?! HEY! 
His voice is swallowed by the dark. After the echoes subside the only sound in the hush is the SIZZLE of falling snow and a weird otherworldly HUM. 
He snaps off his flashlight, thrusts it into his coat pocket. 
GIRL What now?

GUY I guess we see how bad we're stuck. 
They trudge back to the car, boots crunching in the snow. 
GUY (cont'd) You steer, I'll push. 
He holds the passenger door for her while she scrambles in, scooting over into the driver's seat. He leaves the door open so they can communicate. 
He walks back to the rear of the stranded Oldsmobile. 
He's pulling on gloves when something half-buried in the snow nearby catches his eye. He takes out the flashlight, shines it at the roadside. 
Little wooden crosses. 
Just two this time. Another sad shrine, to a different set of anonymous victims of Route 606. 
Their proximity to the stranded Olds obviously unsettles him. 
GIRL (calling) Ready?

GIRL (raving) Maybe! Maybe he's like your Black Pete or something! Why the hell did you tell me that story anyway? 
GUY You're crazy... 
GIRL (lying) Anyway, I've got news for you... I got through to a friend's voicemail while you were supposedly unconscious. I'm sure she's called the cops by now. 
GUY Would you listen to yourself? What kind of psycho do you think I am? 
GIRL Exactly. 
He straightens, exasperated, puts a hand to his injured head. 
She looks at him standing there, hugging himself against the sub-zero cold, his teeth chattering. He doesn't look like an ax-murderer. 
She doesn't know what to do. There's a long beat. Finally, he throws up his hands in disgust, decides to go to Plan B. 
GUY I'm gonna walk back to the gas station for help. You've got the heater and the radio, so you should be all right here. Though I really think you should consider coming with me. 
GIRL I bet you do. 
GUY (pissed) Fine. Whatever. If you feel a draft and you want to patch this...

Sticking his fingertips through the half-inch gap at the top of the stuck passenger side window. 
GUY (cont'd) ... I keep duct tape in the back. 
GIRL (sarcastic) I bet you do. 
He looks in at her one last time, exits. 
She listens to the crunch of his footsteps until she can't hear them anymore. 
Suddenly there's a loud BANG against the passenger side window. She jumps. 
GUY BUT IT'S MY CAR!! 
He goes crazy on the stranded Olds: punching the roof, jerking the door handle, kicking the door, screaming at her the whole time. 
She cowers inside, scared to death. 
Finally he gives up, and with a final BANG to the roof, exits. 
He turns and heads back down the road. 
We watch through the rear window as he trudges robotically away, his boots crunch-crunch-crunching in the snow. 
He stops.   Leans his weight against a tree.    Looks back at the car. 
Whatever it is he's doing, he's clearly not walking to the gas station. 
He straightens, and continues on until he's out of sight. 
37   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                      37 
The stranded Oldsmobile sits on the roadside, engine running, hood and windshield covered in white. The interior lights are on, giving it an enchanted look, like a cottage in a Grimm's fairytale.

38   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                38 
She's in the back seat ransacking his suitcase and other possessions, looking for the duct tape. Despite the heater it's cold enough in the car (thanks to the gap in the window) to see her breath. 
A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT plays on the car's radio. 
RADIO PSA ... The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for the entire Eastern Seaboard... Boxer shorts. Socks. Box of condoms. A copy of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. A cheap Radio Shack TELEPHONE wrapped in its cord. A CROW BAR, which she tosses up to the front seat. 
RADIO PSA (cont'd) ... Carbon County residents can expect snow accumulations of four to six inches... Suddenly we see - 
A BLUR OF MOVEMENT outside the car's foggy REAR WINDOW... 
But she's too busy searching through the junk in the back seat to notice. 
Finally she finds what she's looking for: silver DUCT TAPE. 
Also a PAIR OF SCISSORS. 
She holds the scissors like a dagger, clearly thinking they could come in useful if she needs to defend herself. 
She climbs up front, rips off a three-foot length of tape.

GIRL I don't know, it was weird. I saw some guy walking down the road. 
GUY Where did he go? 
GIRL I don't know. Into the woods. 
Her eyes keep cutting back and forth between him and the woods where the stranger disappeared, as if not sure which is the greater threat. 
GUY Look. It's freezing out here. Let's just get in the car and you can tell me what happened... 
GIRL (paranoid) What are you doing back so soon? What about hiking to the gas station? 
GUY It was closed. I was going to leave a note, but I didn't... You know. Have anything to write with. 
She clutches the scissors tighter, not believing a word. 
GIRL But those places are supposed to stay open 24/7! Why wasn't it open? 
GUY How the hell should I know?! Independent operator. Look, can we continue this conversation in the car, `cause I'm freezing my balls off standing out here. 
GIRL (shrieks) I'm not getting into the car with you, you psycho!!! 
He closes his eyes and shakes his head, beyond frustrated.

GUY Fine. Whatever. I'm getting in. You're welcome to join me. 
He turns and trudges back to the Oldsmobile, climbs in, and pulls the door shut after him. Leaving her there in the snowy road, clutching the scissors, her teeth chattering. 
She stands there, shivering, looking very small and alone. 
HOLD on her as she weighs her options: stay out here and freeze. Or risk seeking shelter with a stalker. 
Not much of a choice. 
40   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - MOMENTS LATER                         40 
He looks over as the door wrenches open and she climbs in. 
She pulls the door shut behind her, then huddles against it. Eyeing him warily. 
He starts to reach toward her and she brandishes the scissors- 
GUY Relax. 
- and switches off the overhead interior lights, explaining: 
GUY (cont'd) We need to conserve the battery. 
With the interior light off the car fills with an otherwordly blue glow reflected off the snow. She pulls her knees up as if trying to make herself as small as she can, to position herself as far away from him as is humanly possible on a bench seat. 
Her eyes cut to the DASHBOARD CLOCK.    She frowns. 
GIRL That's not right. The clock... 
GUY (checks watch) Huh? No, it's not. It should read... 
He frowns, looking down at his watch.    He holds it to his ear.

GUY (cont'd) My watch stopped. Oh well... Guess we'll just have to rely on my precisely calibrated body clock. 
He tosses his useless watch over his shoulder into the back seat. 
Suddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head. 
GIRL Hey. 
GUY What? 
GIRL You're bleeding. 
He touches two fingers to the left side of his head. They come away bloody. As he lifts his watch cap we see the left side of his head is matted with frozen blood, now beginning to melt. The collar of his coat is soaked with it. 
GUY It's nothing... 
GIRL It doesn't look like nothing. 
GUY Okay, you've made your point! I'm a creep who gets off on chauffeuring women under false pretenses. Can we drop this already? (changing subject) Christ. I'm starving. You hungry? 
He leans over the seatback, begins rummaging in the back. 
GUY (cont'd) Did you see a bag of groceries in the trunk? 
At mention of groceries she temporarily drops the topic of the gas station. Remembers: 
GIRL No. Oh, shit. I think I might've left it in the parking lot. 
GUY What?! 
GIRL I'm sorry. It was an accident- 
GUY Shit! I spent sixty bucks on this gourmet crap you like! Saint Andre's cheese and Carr's crackers and those stupid little French pickles, I forget what they're called- 
GIRL (quietly) Cornichons... I love cornichons. 
He sighs, slumps back behind the steering wheel, defeated. 
GUY I know. 
43   EXT. ROUTE 606 - ROADSIDE - NIGHT                                43 
The wind blows.    In between gusts it's quiet, except for the strange HUM.

She's still huddled up front, still holding her scissors. 
He's in the back seat, scouring the car for anything edible, scrounging Tic Tacs, stale pretzel nibs, a candy bar, etc. 
GUY I think I remember losing pack of Big Red down the back seat cushions last week... 
He thrusts his hand between the seat cushions like a scuba diver feeling for lobster under a coral reef. 
DOWN THE BACK SEAT: 
His hand fumbles in the dark space below the seat cushions, among the seatbelts, lost nickels and dimes, lint. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Suddenly his eyes go wide as something lurking under the seats seizes his hand and jerks him in hard. 
She GASPS. 
His face contorts in agony. 
Then changes to a smile, as he pulls his hand free, unhurt, holding a stick of gum. 
GUY (cont'd) Kidding. 
She looks at him in mute fury and disbelief. He shrugs, unwraps a stick of Big Red and pops it into his mouth. 
GIRL Asshole. 
Suddenly his hand shoots out and seizes her wrist holding the scissors. Her eyes go wide in terror and she starts to resist, but his grip is too strong. 
GUY (gritted teeth) Let go, goddamnit...

GIRL No! 
GUY Give them to me! 
GIRL No!!! 
With his free hand he reaches over and wrenches the scissors away from her, his eyes flashing. She gives a little terrified whimper as he pulls her close, brandishes the scissors. 
GUY I need these. 
45   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - LATER                               45 
With the blade of the open scissors he divides a stale candy bar, divvying it up. 
He closes the scissors. Serves up the two halves of candy bar on napkins with a side of stale pretzel nibs. 
GUY I still can't believe you left all our food in a stupid parking lot. 
GIRL Look, I'm sorry, okay? I'll write you a check for sixty bucks if it will make you get off my case. I don't know what else I can say. 
GUY Let's just eat. 
Christmas gifts, skimpy tees, panties and bras, a bikini. 
GUY Ah, Jesus. 
GIRL (defensive) I'm sorry, but who could prepare for something like this?! I've got a complete winter wardrobe, it's just in Delaware... And no, that doesn't make me a flake! 
He unzips his suitcase.      Starts pulling out Ragg socks, long- sleeve pullovers, etc. 
He shoves a ball of clothes into her hands without a word.

The kids have retreated to the front- and back seats for privacy while they change. Not an easy proposition in the cramped quarters. 
She strips down to bra and panties as demurely as possible. Puts on his insulated underwear and the rest of their things. 
He slips on his woefully inadequate shirts and pants. It's obvious he gave the warmest stuff to her. Also that he took the backseat because it's more cramped than the front.

Once they're finished dressing he reaches up, switches off the interior light. 
They lie in the blue darkness for a few moments of silence, watching their breath plume in the cold air. [Note: from this point on, their breath will always be visible in the car.] 
He hears her sigh, restless. 
GUY What's the matter? 
GIRL I'm freezing. I can't feel my toes. 
GUY Me neither. 
Nothing much they can do about it.   They fall silent again. 
GUY (cont'd) You know, there is a better way for two people to conserve body heat- 
GIRL Dream on. 
But we see her smiling a little in the dark front seat. 
They lie in silence for another beat as she tries every position possible to get comfortable. Finally she sits up. 
GUY What? 
GIRL Gotta pee. 
She starts to climb over into the cramped front seat, intending to go outside. He winces when she puts a hand on his chest to steady herself as she climbs over him. 
GUY (testy) Why didn't you go before, when we were outside? 
GIRL Because it's freezing out. We're talking about an arctic air mass out of Canada.

She pops the door and exits. 
50   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                      50 
She climbs out into the bitter cold, hunched against the howling wind, and moves off as far as she dares from the car. 
She fumbles with the buttons and zippers of her multiple layers, turns her back to the car, squats to pee. 
Her teeth chatter as she does her business, one wary eye peeled to catch the guy peeking. 
Suddenly, out of the gloom appears - 
A DARK FIGURE, moving by very near her. 
She GASPS. Tumbles back onto her ass.     As she's struggling to pull up her pants - 
MORE DARK FIGURES appear, moving in the same direction. 
As the figures enter the woods their leader turns so she glimpses his face: elderly and unremarkable at first glance, then for an instant CHANGING into a twisted ashen deathmask. 
Her SCREAM brings our guy BOLTING out of the car. 
GUY What?! What happened?! 
Retrieves a bunch of OLD NEWSPAPERS. He stuffs them inside the front of his jacket. Continues rummaging around in the firebox. 
As he rises he winces in pain, one hand going to his side. 
He takes slow breaths until the pain subsides. 
He turns in a slow circle. His flashlight sweeps over the interior of the abandoned ruins, the beam picking out what look like branches - 
HUMAN HANDS 
frozen into claws, reaching from... 
A FROZEN BODY. 
It's lying on the bare springs of a metal bedframe: teeth clenched in a terrible rictus, icicles dripping from nose, clawlike fingers, eyes. 
He's so startled he nearly drops the flashlight. 
The wayward light finding ANOTHER FROZEN CORPSE in a nearby bed mere feet away: another rictus grimace, clawlike fingers seeming to reach for him. And then another. And another... 
All OLD MEN. 
Frozen in their death throes, like the bodies from Pompeii. 
ONE OF THE BEDS is EMPTY. 
Our guy sweeps the flashlight beam to the side and finds the bed's occupant: frozen sitting upright in an old wooden wheelchair. 
Eye to eye with him. 
He reels in horror, trips, LOSES THE FLASHLIGHT as he goes sprawling. Then recovers, snatching the flashlight up again and sweeping it back in the direction of the frozen bodies - 
And sees NOTHING:   No beds.   No old men...

Just as she's reaching for the door handle she GASPS - 
As a FIGURE suddenly appears out of the darkness.

It's the black STRANGER from earlier, shuffling and mumbling. This time he's close enough for her to make out some of the words he's muttering: 
STRANGER ...please, officer, please don't... 
GIRL Wait! 
Determined not to let him vanish again, she takes off in pursuit, coming alongside him and keeping pace as he shuffles down the middle of the road. 
STRANGER ...don't put me in the river... 
Suddenly she glances down, sees why he's shuffling so oddly. 
His ankles above his sodden dress shoes are bound with BALING WIRE, as are his wrists. 
GIRL (shocked) Oh my god! Who did this to you?! 
STRANGER ...please, officer, just take the booze and let me go... 
She reaches toward him. 
The instant her hand nears him the wind HOWLS DEAFENINGLY. She experiences a sudden powerful JOLT, almost as if she's grabbed a live wire... only instead of electric heat she feels a terrible otherwordly cold... 
Frostbite. 
The jolt stuns the stranger out of his daze, and for the first time he becomes aware of her. He raises his frightened eyes to her slowly, and in doing so reveals his face. 
A scream builds in her throat at sight of him. 
The stranger's face is bloodless, bloated, swollen with rot. 
A sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth moves, as if he's trying to speak. 
But instead of words emerging, his throat suddenly bulges. Something's in there, fighting its way up his esophagus.

GIRL (stunned) What just... out there...? 
GUY I don't know. 
GIRL (unsure) But it did happen, right? Or not... 
Our guy winces in pain.     TILT DOWN to reveal: 
HIS HANDS 
Frostbitten, still clutching the crowbar. She tries to take it out of his bloody, blackened hands and he GASPS in agony.

She pours water from a plastic bottle over his palms to try and break the seal between the fused skin and metal. 
GIRL (cont'd) OK, hold on, this is going to hurt. 
GUY Do it. 
She fights her own gag reflex as she pulls the crowbar free. It comes away with several long black strips of dead skin still attached. His palms are bloody pulps. 
He fights to hold himself together as she ministers to him. The pain is so bad it brings tears to his eyes. His teeth chatter; he's teetering on the edge of shock. 
GUY (cont'd) How bad? 
GIRL Frostbite, second and third-degree. 
GUY How do you know? You take a first aid course or something? 
GIRL Ski camp, seventh grade... (off his look) Don't make fun. What else do you have going on when you're thirteen? 
She stretches herself out alongside him in the back seat. 
Tugs up her layers of sweaters to expose her stomach. 
GUY (weak) I'm kinda not in the mood anymore. 
GIRL We have to rewarm your hands. You have ice crystals in your blood. If we don't get circulation restored you could lose your fingers.

She takes his frostbitten hands and gingerly as possible presses them against the warm skin of her belly, rewarming them. 
They lie there in silence for a beat, faces inches apart.

She skim-reads ahead, trying to glean more information.

She tears the brittle top pages of the newspaper away. 
Finds there is no page seven. 
GUY (gritted teeth) You got that Tylenol? 
GIRL Coming. 
She climbs over into the back seat, feeds him two of the Tylenol with a sip of water from a bottle. Then stretches out alongside him again.

Both kids are asleep in the back seat. 
She's dreaming, her eyes roving behind closed lids.   All of a sudden she stirs, eyes fluttering open in the dark.   Shivers. 
Woken by a cold draft. 
She shivers, sits up, disentangling herself from the guy snoring quietly beside her in the cramped back seat. 
She locates the source of the draft. 
The STUCK PASSENGER WINDOW up front, where the duct-tape- newspaper patch has come loose. She shivers as a gust of wind blows a few snowflakes in. 
She grabs the roll of duct tape, climbs up into the front. Tears off a fresh strip of tape off to replace the old one. She smooths it in place, her teeth chattering between yawns. 
Just then the radio SNAPS on by itself. 
BRENDA LEE Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, at the Christ-mas par-ty hop. She freezes. 
Her eyes cut to the backlit radio dial as the song continues. 
BRENDA LEE (cont'd) Mistletoe hung where you can see, ev'ry couple tries to STOP - The radio SHUTS OFF mid-song. 
She holds still, scared to move, scared to even breathe. 
Her eyes cut to the interior light as it starts flickering in a weird staccato way that's more Morse Code than loose wire. 
After a few seconds it stops. 
The seconds creep by on the dashboard clock. 
She peeks over the front seat looking out the back window, wondering where his highway patrol car is.

62   NIGHTMARE - EXT. `57 CHEVY / ROADSIDE - NIGHT (1958)             62 
... and into a sweltering summer night in the late 1950s... 
What follows is brutal and hallucinatory: a SERIES OF SHOTS that thrust us into the sickening first person POV of a BLONDE young woman, 19, in the final moments of her life. The RASP of CICADAS in the treetops provide the only soundtrack to the assault, as we see: 
-- CLOSE ON their feet, high heels and boots, doing a violent two-step as he drags her along the gravel road shoulder 
-- HANDHELD footage as she's dragged toward his idling patrol car 
-- POV of a FULL MOON in the tree-tops, dispassionate spectator to the assault going on on this lonely stretch of road 
-- CLOSE UP of the COP'S MOUTH, twisted with lust as he whispers something obscene we cannot hear. 
-- CLOSE ON his HAND working it's way up to her throat, forcing his thick hairy thumb between her lips and making her suck. 
-- POV underneath his patrol car, as his boots kick her feet apart, and take up position between them 
The assault coming from everywhere at once now, the cop an elemental force, like the storm itself. Skittering along the undercarriage one moment, across the metal roof the next. Even appearing -- fleetingly, impossibly -- in the snow on the blocked driver's side window. 
All the electronics in the car start going crazy, power locks opening and closing, the interior light flickering, the dashboard clock hands spinning wildly, the windshield wipers sweeping back and forth, etc. 
Then stop all at once. 
Even the radio SNAPS OFF. 
Dead silence for a beat. 
Then an odd SCUTTLING SOUND underfoot, something crawling along the undercarriage of the car. 
Our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to even breathe. 
Likewise, the girl sits nervously, watching her breath in the cold. Her eyes happen to wander to the rear view mirror- 
A blue-faced DEAD BABY stares back at her from the rear window ledge. 
She SWINGS around, looks back at the window.   But nothing's there.

She turns back, he looks at her with concern. Unsure of her own senses, she shakes him off. Exhales slowly. 
Beat. 
Suddenly the scuttling noises outside EXPLODE into to a full- blown assault. 
There's the shriek of RENDING METAL, the thing outside begins HAMMERING at the car's hood, doors, etc. 
The car gives a violent shudder side-to-side tosses our kids around like plastic flakes in a snow globe. 
The radio snaps back on: the saxophone solo in the Brenda Lee song, accompanying the violent CLANGS and GROANS of metal being torn asunder as the thing under the car rips away muffler, brake lines, wrenches the handles from the doors, etc. 
BRENDA LEE Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, Have a happy hol-i-day... Our guy claps hands over his ears so he can't hear the sound of the cop's rage as he attacks the car, fury growing and growing until it's indistinguishable from the HOWLING wind outside. 
The attack ends. 
The red police light in the rear window FADES. 
Leaving them sitting there in the dark in stunned silence. 
GIRL What happened? 
GUY I think... he's gone. I guess when he couldn't get in he gave up. (suddenly grinning) I told you these `88 Olds were built like tanks! 
He turns around in the front seat to shake a bandaged fist at the rear window. 
GUY (cont'd) (nervous relief) HAH! Next time pick on someone driving a Hyundai-

GIRL Shhh! How do you know it's not a trick! He could still be out there waiting- 
GUY He's not! Listen! 
They sit in silence, listening, but hear only the wind. 
GIRL But what if he comes back..? 
GUY We just have to stay in the car until morning. Then we'll be safe. That can't be more than, like, a few more hours... Someone's bound to come along once the sun comes up... Someone human I mean. Think you can hold on until then? 
GIRL (shy) What if, you know. We have to pee? 
GUY We can use the empty water bottles. From this point on, the back seat is a co-ed bathroom. Sound like a plan? 
Sounds like a plan.

He nods, understanding. 
So they just hunker down in the front seat, staring at the snow covered windshield, and start the long wait to morning. 
It's noisy up here, thanks to the WIND and the icy telephone wires, source of the mysterious HUMMING she's been hearing. 
She tries the little metal door of the grey JUNCTION BOX. 
Locked. 
GIRL No!!! 
She fumbles in her coat, takes out the SCISSORS, uses them to try and pry open the junction box (which turns out to be frozen shut, not locked after all.) 
It finally yields, opening.

Revealing a rat's nest of multicolored WIRES and PHONE JACKS. 
Hurrying now, she tugs her glove off with her teeth, and with her bare hand retrieves the cord-wrapped RECEIVER from inside her sweater. In her effort to juggle all these items she loses her grip on the SCISSORS... 
Which drop all the   way down to disappear in the snow below. 
She concentrates now on the receiver.    But her fingers are so clumsy from the cold, she fumbles it. 
And the receiver FALLS too. 
Then jerks to a STOP a few feet below as it reaches the limit of its cord. 
Which she's managed to catch. She winds the receiver up by its cord, finally plugs the jack-end into the junction box.

GIRL Hello? Hello? 
The connection SPARKS and she feels a small shock that makes her drop the phone. When she retrieves it and holds it back to her ear the line is DEAD. 
No way of knowing if her message got through. 
It's a moment of such soul-crushing despair she shuts her eyes and leans her head against the pole, as if wanting to just quietly die up here thirty feet above the earth.

Her eyes open, and she commences climbing back down to earth. 
She reaches the second set of rungs from the bottom and drops the last several feet. The snow does little to cushion her fall and she goes sprawling, lays there for a dazed moment. 
She starts crawling on all fours back toward the stranded Olds. Suddenly she stops as she comes upon- 
A WOMAN'S BARE FEET 
standing in the snow, veins visible through gravid skin. 
A thick spatter of mud lands on the bare foot. 
Our girl raises her eyes to see - 
A DEAD WOMAN 
It's the blonde we saw raped and murdered in the summer of 1958. Her dress is in tattered ruins, coated in leaves and dirt like someone recently exhumed from a shallow grave. 
Her head is twisted at an unnatural angle on a broken neck. 
HEADLIGHTS appear on the dark horizon.   We see them a split- second before she does... 
He's coming. 
When she glimpses the oncoming headlights out of the corner of her eye she turns her head slowly in their direction, and for an instant it almost seems as if they don't register. 
Then her eyes widen in terror, she lets out a small whimper, and leaps into action. 
She scrambles to her feet and makes a mad dash toward the Oldsmobile - 
Only to find when she tugs on the handle that it's STUCK. 
She yanks on it harder, getting frantic now, as - 
The HEADLIGHTS get brighter, bearing down, close enough now that we can hear the ROAR of the oncoming engine. 
She kicks the handle, tugs with all her might, rocking the car but not succeeding in getting the door open. 
As the headlights become BLINDING... 
Suddenly there's the sound of BRAKES being engaged, and the headlights slow to a stop just a few yards shy of where she's standing in the middle of the road. 
She shields her eyes with an upraised hand. 
It's a SNOWPLOW. 
The SNOWPLOW DRIVER, 50s, sticks his head out the window. 
SNOWPLOW DRIVER You kids okay? 
She's too stunned to speak.

While the snowplow driver tests the front tire chains, our girl checks on our guy's body. 
The snowplow driver climbs up behind the wheel, gives her a sympathetic look. Picks up the C.B. microphone.

88   INT. SNOWPLOW - NIGHT                                            88 
She stares blankly out the window at the snow swirling in the headlights. 
The snowplow driver makes small-talk to help pass the time. 
SNOWPLOW DRIVER Been some real bad accidents on this road over the years. When I was growing up, there was a family from New York City found out here froze solid- 
QUICK CUT TO: 
89   EXT. STRANDED VOLVO - DAY (1970)                                 89 
- The snowplow flipping ASS-OVER-TEAKETTLE 
- Inside the snowplow the world somersaults, our guy's body thrown halfway out of the shattered windshield onto the hood. 
- The highway patrol car skidding off the side of the road and dropping from sight, crashing with a SPLASH somewhere in the darkness. 
- As the snowplow comes to a rest right-side up on its tires as we - 
SMASH TO BLACK 
98   EXT. PRECIPICE / RAVINE - LATER                                 98 
The WRECKED SNOWPLOW has ended up on the edge of the ravine where the highway patrol car disappeared. 
There's a metallic GROAN of hinges as the snowplow's driver's side door opens and the SNOWPLOW DRIVER, dazed but unhurt, climbs out. 
He calls down into the gloom below, where we hear the faint sounds of the highway patrol car's RADIO playing "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree." 
SNOWPLOW DRIVER Hang on, officer, I'm coming... 
Then he begins to make his way down. 
99   INT. WRECKED SNOWPLOW - THAT MOMENT                             99 
Our girl rouses from her post-accident daze. Sees the body of our guy thrown through the windshield. She eases it back inside and onto the seat beside her. 
She looks up in time to see through the windshield - 
The SNOWPLOW DRIVER making his way down the steep slippery ice-and-leaf-covered embankment. 
Her eyes go wide as she suddenly realizes where he's headed. 
GIRL No!!! 
She unbuckles her seatbelt, throws open the passenger door, exits.

100   EXT. SNOWPLOW / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                               100 
The instant she sets foot outside she stops dead, the blood rushing from her face and her eyes going wide in disbelief. 
PAN 360-DEGREES to reveal a landscape she knows all-too-well: 
The stranded `88 Oldsmobile. 
The telephone pole she climbed. 
They haven't gone anywhere. 
No time to puzzle it out. The sound of the snowplow driver making his way down the embankment O.S. stirs her to action. 
101   EXT. RAVINE - CONTINUOUS                                       101 
She starts down the steep snowy embankment after the snowplow driver, who is now far enough below to be out of sight. 
GIRL (calling down) Wait! Don't go down there! Stop! 
Suddenly the snowy leaves gives way under her and she SLIPS. 
Lands hard and SLIDES the rest of the way down on her ass. 
102   EXT. BOTTOM OF RAVINE - CONTINUOUS                             102 
She comes to a stop thirty feet below at the bottom of the ravine beside the surprised SNOWPLOW DRIVER. 
And the HIGHWAY PATROL CAR. 
It's resting on its roof in the snow at the bottom of the ravine, wheels in the air. It looks like an overturned beetle. 
Something moves in its front seat. 
The snowplow driver calls to the TRAPPED HIGHWAY PATROLMAN. 
SNOWPLOW DRIVER Hang on, officer! We'll get you out! 
She catches his arm to stop him.

GIRL No!!! Don't go near it!!! 
SNOWPLOW DRIVER What!!? We have to get him out of there... 
Smoke rises from the car's gas tank, a small FIRE burning. 
Suddenly - 
The COP launches himself out of the window of the overturned car at them. 
Skin peeled and blackened, he starts crawling over the rocks, dragging his paralyzed lower body after them. 
The snowplow driver's eyes go wide and he stands rooted in place, unable to move. 
She grabs him by the arm, pulls him away. 
GIRL (cont'd) MOVE!!

He comes to his senses, staggers up the embankment after her. He loses his footing on the icy rocks and goes sprawling. 
As the cop seizes him around the legs, and starts crawling up the length of his body. 
We hear the sizzle of instant FROSTBITE, the frost spreading with time-lapse speed up the snowplow driver's limbs as he shrieks in agony. 
Until even his shriek is FROZEN IN HIS LUNGS. 
ANGLE ON OUR GIRL 
As she begins scrambling up the snowy slope away from the horror below. 
Suddenly she loses her grip and starts to slide back down on her belly toward the cop a dozen feet below. 
She whimpers, fingers clutching at anything. 
Finally she succeeds, manages to haul herself up the steep embankment, climbing with everything she's got left in her until she reaches the road. 
103    EXT. TOP OF THE RAVINE / WRECKED SNOWPLOW - NIGHT                103 
She hauls herself up from the gloomy abyss, wrenches the driver side door open and scrambles inside - 
104    INT. WRECKED SNOWPLOW - CONTINUOUS                               104 
She pulls the door closed, twists the key in the ignition. 
Nothing. 
GIRL (urgently) Come on, come on! 
She tries again.    And again.   But the engine is dead. 
Just then she notices the "power" light glowing on the C.B. She ducks under the dashboard, retrieves the microphone, sits up again - 
The cop. 
Unscathed.

Standing right outside the snowplow, restored to his former glory, grinning at her. 
Then the smile curdles. He reaches through the shattered window. Grabbing for her. 
She scrabbles just out of reach.    Pins herself against the opposite door. Cornered. 
Suddenly - 
GUY Get away from her, you bastard! 
And OUR GUY'S GHOST appears out of the gloom. 
He swings a CROWBAR into the cop's skull. 
And, just like before, there's a VIOLENT FLASH OF light and - 
SMASH CUT TO: 
105   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                 105 
It's like someone pressed RESET. 
She's back inside the STRANDED OLDSMOBILE, seated beside the body of our guy. 
Her panicked breathing turns into hyperventilation as she realizes all efforts to escape the road are futile. 
Suddenly she spots something through the windshield that causes her breath to catch - 
OUR GUY'S GHOST

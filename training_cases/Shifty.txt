SHIFTY 
Written by 
Eran Creevy 
1   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING 
A large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer, makes its way along a stretch of motorway. 
2   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING 
At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play on his MP3. 
3   INT. COACH. MORNING 
Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera, Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day", a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye. 
The track will play over the following opening scenes, the credits fading subtly in and out in white text. 
4   EXT. STREET. MORNING 
We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to house the east end after the Second World War. 
CUT TO: 
We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up. 
SHIFTY 
Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a fence, making a short cut. 
5   INT. TREVOR HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING 
Bird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset, pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water, holding his nose. 
SIDE ANGLE ON BATH: TREVOR RISES, NOT GASPING FOR AIR, JUST CALM, UNNATURAL ALMOST. SNOT RUNS FROM HIS NOSTRILS. 
6    INT. COACH. MORNING. 
Chris stares out of the window. The music still playing on his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN. 
7    INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING 
Glen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of cocaine onto a clean glass table. 
8    INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING 
Jasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white dressing gown, prepares breakfast. 
9    EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING 
Shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping over a fence at the end. 
10   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING 
Suddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits. 
11   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING 
In an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work. He climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation. 
12   INT. COACH. MORNING 
Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same strip of waste land Shifty just walked across. 
13   GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING 
Glen splits the cocaine into two piles. 
CHRIS Good to see you, mate. 
SHIFTY Good to see you too, geezer. 
26   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING 
CLOSE ON: WATER GUSHES FROM A TAP. 
Chris stands splashing his face from the sink. His bag perched on the cistern. He looks at himself in the mirror. 
27   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / SHIFTY'S BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING 
Chris walks into Shifty's bedroom. He puts down his bag and pulls on a fresh tee shirt. He looks around at the room. New DVD player, LCD on the wall, a new game console, DVD's, CD's, lots of pristine trainers placed perfectly side by side, books about business, books about film, a perfectly stacked pile of mobile phone bills with the word "PAID" scribed across them. A picture of Mohammed Ali next to a picture of Allah. He approaches the window and looks out at the morning sun resting over a dull, featureless Dudlowe New-Town. He stands, staring. 
28   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING 
Chris walks into the kitchen to see Shifty getting breakfast ready. Shifty turns to face him. 
SHIFTY You alright son? 
CHRIS Yeah I just needed to splash my face, freshen up a bit. 
SHIFTY Have you slept? 
CHRIS Did I fuck. 
SHIFTY Mate, neither have I... I just got back from some girls yard. 
CHRIS You got a bird? 
SHIFTY No, no... just some fucking booty call. 
CHRIS What, Break Glass Arse? 
SHIFTY In case of emergency's, man... you know it. 
They both laugh. Shifty lays sausages into a pan. 
CHRIS She fit? 
SHIFTY What! 
CHRIS She fit? 
SHIFTY Yeah, she's alright you know.... She's got fucking massive Gary's. 
Chris laughs. 
CHRIS You always loved your titties, bruv. 
SHIFTY You know that! 
Shifty lays sausages into a sizzling pan. 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) Mate, do you mind halal? 
CHRIS No, no, that's sweet mate, whatever. 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY Were you on just one bus? 
CHRIS Yeah... no sorry, two. I had to change at Luton. 
SHIFTY LUTON! 
CHRIS Yeah, man. 
SHIFTY Fucking random. 
JASMINE Where's the grey suitcase? 
TREVOR What? I can't hear you babe. 
JASMINE I want to start getting stuff ready for next week - where's the grey suitcase? 
TREVOR I'll find it when I get home. 
JASMINE It's all right babe I'll get it. 
TREVOR Jasmine, I'll get it when I get home. 
JASMINE Babe it's fine, I'll get it down. 
TREVOR (Stern) I'LL FIND THE FUCKING THING WHEN I GET HOME. 
CLICK! 
He breathes in hard, takes a moment to calm down and then starts the engine. 
31   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. MORNING 
Jasmine drops the phone by her side, shocked at Trevor's temperament, and watches through the front room window as he drives away. 
32   INT. SHIFTY'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING 
Shifty's laying out the breakfast. At that moment, Rez, Shifty's brother, walks in. Mid 30's, portly. He sees Chris. 
REZ (PAKISTANI - SUBTITLED) Motherfucker, the return of the white man. 
Chris stands and goes to embrace Rez, but Rez walks past and grabs a glass of orange juice from the side. 
CHRIS How you doing Rez, good to see you, man? 
REZ I wondered why I could hear voices. I thought he'd brought home a rent boy again. 
SHIFTY Shut up you prick. 
REZ (To Chris) You look like a rent boy. 
CHRIS What are you talking about? 
Points at Chris. 
REZ That top cost more than my education. 
CHRIS My pants cost more than your education. 
REZ (sings) Cold blooded. 
Shifty lays down three plates of breakfast. Rez fakes a heart attack. 
SHIFTY (PAKISTANI) Soak it in fat boy. 
CHRIS I take it this doesn't happen often. 
REZ You know what, I'm emotional, where's my camera, bring me my camera. Quick, man, quick. 
SHIFTY Yeah, fucking laugh it up. 
REZ (PAKISTANI) Don't worry I will. 
Shifty sits down and they begin their food. 
33   EXT. TREVOR'S VAN. MORNING 
Trevor sits at the wheel, parked in a residential street. He dials a number on his mobile but gets the following message 
(V.O.) This number is currently unavailable please try agai... 
CHRIS No, not yet. 
REZ Gay? 
CHRIS No... you? 
REZ I'm asking the questions padre... for your information... no, I'm not... but Shifty is. 
SHIFTY Jokes. 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) (to Chris) What have you got, rent or mortgage? 
CHRIS Fucking hell, tag team... Mortgage. 
REZ That's nice. 
SHIFTY Yeah, mature, man. 
A BEAT. 
REZ Why do you leave without saying goodbye to my brother? 
Chris is stumped. Shifty looks down at the floor. 
SHIFTY Rez, man... 
REZ I'm only joking... 
A BEAT. 
REZ (CONT'D) But really, why? 
SHIFTY Leave him alone. 
REZ I need info, man. I'm like a sponge, do you know what I mean, I'm like a flannel... How come your back, what's the deal? 
SHIFTY I invited him to a party. 
REZ Who's party? 
CHRIS Rachel's. 
REZ Rachel who? 
SHIFTY Rachel Price. 
REZ Who? 
SHIFTY Mate, Rachel and Serena. 
Rez pauses, thinking. Chris clocks him with an almost icy stare. 
REZ Oh right. 
Chris looks back down at his magazine. Rez knows he hit a raw nerve. An uncomfortable silence. Shifty tries to break the ice by talking about a more trivial topic. 
SHIFTY (to Rez) You remember Rachel, you fucking lunged her at Jazzbo Browns? 
REZ WHAT... that's BULLSHIT. 
CHRIS Yeah, yeah, you went in for the kill and she lent away like she was doing the fucking limbo. 
Chris is back in the conversation. 
SHIFTY Her ponytail swept the floor. 
Shifty and Chris touch fists. 
CHRIS You gonna go? 
SHIFTY Am I fuck. 
52   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY 
Trevor drives slowly past the house to see Rez putting out the rubbish. Rez turns around and stares at Trevor. Trevor looks away and drives off. 
53   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / UP STAIRS BATHROOM. DAY 
Jasmine sits on the toilet, she opens a pregnancy test and urinates onto it. 
INT. TREVORS' HOUSE. BATHROOM (PART 1) / FREDDIE'S BEDROOM. DAY (PART 2) 
Freddie is on his games console. He's at the controls of a racing game. It's on really loud. 
CUT TO: 
Holding up the pregnancy test Jasmine see's it turn to a plus sign. She's pregnant again. 
CUT TO: 
Tight on the screen as Freddie's computerised car screeches around a corner. 
CUT TO: 
Jasmine stares forward, her face fretful. 
CUT TO: 
Freddie's car smashes loudly against a barrier. 
CUT TO: 
Sitting, staring, suddenly Jasmine notices something on the tiled surface. She rubs her finger over it to reveal the residue of a white powder. 
CUT TO: 
The game is loud. Echoing through the house. 
CUT TO: 
She dabs finger with tongue, her face sours. She was almost hoping she was wrong. 
CUT TO: 
Freddie laughs as his car smashes into another opponent. 
CUT TO: 
Jasmine's eyes are alive with rage; the TV bellows out - suddenly she stands, pulls up her kickers and steams towards Freddie's room. 
JASMINE (screaming) TURN THAT FUCKING TV DOWN BEFORE I THROW IT OUT OF THE FUCKING WINDOW! 
Freddie little face is totally bewildered. 
55   EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET. DAY 
Shifty and Chris approach a clapped out, red four-door VW Golf circa 1986. As they loom closer Glen exits the car from the back. 
GLEN What you saying you fucking rag- head, you alright bad boy? 
SHIFTY Dowdy! 
GLEN You been on the roids mate you're looking bigger? 
Shifty's almost exasperated with Glen already. 
SHIFTY No, I haven't, no. 
CHRIS What happened to her face? 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY Apparently... Glen... I think... injected her with some fucking cocktail... I dunno... smack, I think... he passed out first... she passed out... but apparently she was lying up against a radiator... the fucking thing came on full whack. She was so out of it, she didn't even know it was on.... 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) ...the paramedics had to peel her off. 
CHRIS Jesus Christ! 
Chris looks back out over the estate. Shifty's phone starts ringing. He looks at the screen it reads Trevor P MOB. He hits reject. 
62   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY 
Trevor gets the answering machine. He smashes out at his dashboard. 
63   INT. REZ'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY 
Rez carries a bundle of dirty clothes to the washing machine and clumsily throws them in. He pulls out the powder tray but it comes out completely from the machine. 
REZ FUCK! 
He tries to wedge it back in but it doesn't want to go. Rez gets down on his knees and tries again, to no avail. He looks in the gap, and sees something. 
He sticks his fingers in and starts rooting around. He has something; slowly Rez pulls out a large, see-through, watertight bag brimming with wraps of cocaine and crack. Rez sits back against the machine just staring at it. 
64   EXT. HILL TOP. DAY 
Shifty and Chris just sit. Suddenly Chris notices something. 
CHRIS What's that? 
SHIFTY What? 
Chris points. 
CHRIS That fucking thing. 
65   EXT. PARK. DAY 
Shifty and Chris approach an extreme sports park ride that helps build upper strength. At either end of a raised beam are two handles. 
CHRIS What does it fucking do? 
Chris grabs the handles and starts moving with it. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Mate, grab the other end. 
Shifty grabs the handles and starts running parallel to Chris, suddenly they both lift off the ground. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) FUCKING HELL! 
SHIFTY SHIIIIIIIIT! 
They're both cracking up laughing, loving it. 
66   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN / BATHROOM. DAY 
On Jasmine's kitchen floor, just outside the connecting bathroom, are stacked a variety of toiletry goods. The sounds of scrubbing and movement echo out. Jasmine, her dressing gown grubby and soaked, cleanses, scrubs, and cleans the emptied bathroom like a woman possessed. She's purging her haven, washing away the sin that has tainted her sanctum. 
WE CUT TO A LONG SHOT, OVER FREDDIE'S SHOULDER TO SEE HIM WATCHING HER. 
67   EXT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS. DAY. 
A fairly respectable but featureless tenement block looms. 
68   INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS/CORRIDOR. DAY 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) (with threat) YEAH? 
At that moment Otis and his girlfriend look up to see Chris standing in the doorway. His presence adds menace to the situation. 
OTIS Yeah, alright, yeah. 
SHIFTY Because if I hear one word of complaint from next door, just one single complaint, I'll come back here and I'll take your TV, I'll take your stereo, and I'll shove em up your birds arse. 
He lets the words sink in. The girl looks a little shocked. 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) Do you understand me? 
Otis nods. 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? 
OTIS Yeah, yeah, it's cool, I'm sorry, man, I didn't know I had it on loud, I would have turned it down, I'm sorry. 
Silence. Shifty stares Otis out. Otis looks away. Shifty picks up a biro from the floor and writes a number on Otis' wall. 
SHIFTY Call me if you need any more weed. 
He walks into the hallway, past Chris. 
CHRIS (almost disdain) You don't miss a fucking trick. 
SHIFTY You know it. 
78   INT. VALERIE'S BLOCK COUNCIL FLATS / STAIRWELL. DAY 
Shifty and Chris make their way down the winding stairs of the tenement block, Shifty's phone vibrates. 
CLOSE ON: THE SCREEN OF THE PHONE READS: TREVOR P MOB. 
Shifty hits the reject button. Chris follows behind. 
A BEAT. 
CHRIS That was all a bit fucking surreal. 
SHIFTY What d'you mean? 
CHRIS I can't believe you just sold crack to Miss Marple and struck a deal with Blazing Squad. 
Shifty laughs as they carry on descending. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) How old is she? 
SHIFTY About 70. 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) She's been doing drugs longer than we've been alive. 
A BEAT. 
CHRIS Yeah, d'you reckon. 
A BEAT. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) When did you start knocking out? 
SHIFTY Knocking out what? 
CHRIS (lowers his voice) Crack. 
SHIFTY I dunno, about...three, three and a half years ago. 
A BEAT. 
JASMINE Where are you? 
TREVOR Where do you think. I'm on site. 
JASMINE It doesn't sound like it... 
A BEAT. 
TREVOR Babe, look I've got to go, 
JASMINE Well what should I do about the car? 
TREVOR Babe, I've gotta go, Bob's calling me... we'll talk about it later... I'll call you... 
CLICK! He puts down the phone. 
82   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. DAY 
Jasmine sits there for a moment, slightly distracted, then carries on painting with the kids, her mind elsewhere. 
83   EXT. COUNCIL ESTATE. DAY 
Shifty and Chris walk in silence. Chris looks about at the buildings, his eyes searching across the domain that he once knew so well. 
CHRIS Did you tell Rachel? 
SHIFTY What? 
CHRIS About me. 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY No, I didn't. 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) I thought it'd be a surprise. 
Chris looks a little uncomfortable. 
SHIFTY (CONT'D) Mate, it's gonna be fine. 
CHRIS Who else is gonna be there? 
SHIFTY I dunno, lot of her new mates, I don't know many of them. 
A BEAT. 
CHRIS So what's the plan, are you gonna go and see your mum and dad first? 
Shifty looks at him. 
SHIFTY No. 
A BEAT. 
CHRIS You should go man, see what they've got to say? 
SHIFTY I thought you worked in recruitment. 
CHRIS What? 
SHIFTY When do you become a fucking family liaison? 
CHRIS What are you talking about you nutter, I was just saying? 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY I'll be stuck in some fucking warehouse... looking after twenty Bengalis... knocking out dodgy Fruit of the Looms.... I know exactly who they want me to meet, man. 
Chris runs, suddenly Shifty overtakes. Chris is fast but Shifty's like a whippet. 
SHIFTY Follow me. 
Shifty swerves down a side lane, Chris follows. 
85   EXT. ALLEYWAY. DAY 
Malik's legging it down an alleyway, he throws the bag over a wall and goes over after it, he vaults, landing knee deep in a shitty garden pond. 
MALIK Fuck. 
86   EXT. SIDE STREET. DAY 
Shifty and Chris sprint, the police close behind. 
SHIFTY This is bollocks. 
Shifty vaults a brick wall, Chris follows. The drop on the other side is far deeper than expected, they hit the floor hard. Suddenly they see something that grabs their attention. 
87   EXT. CYCLE TRACK. DAY 
Shifty and Chris come swerving around the corner on the crappest kids' bikes you've ever seen. Shifty's knees are near his chin, and Chris' bike is pink with a fairy flag whipping off the back. 
THE CAMERA RIDES PARALLEL WITH THEM AS THEY HURTLE ALONG THE CYCLE TRACK. 
It's not perfect but it's better than running. Shifty starts cracking up laughing. Chris' face looks a little more serious, however. He doesn't find this all quite as funny as Shifty. 
EXT. GROSVENOR ROAD CUT THRU. DAY. 
Shifty sits in an underpass. Random graffiti tarnishes the walls behind them, their bikes lent against the wall. Chris is stood up, leaning on his knees, breathing hard. 
CHRIS Mate, I'm telling you, this is no way to live. 
Chris sits down next to Shifty. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) I'm serious, mate, you need to get away from this shit, come and live with me for a bit. 
Shifty looks at Chris, and reaches into his pocket pulling out a pack of fags. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) I'm serious, mate... Why not? 
Shifty doesn't say anything. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) You'd love Manchester, man, it's full of fitness. 
Shifty stays quiet, and smokes. They sit their for a moment. 
SHIFTY I can't just fuck off. 
CHRIS Yeah, you can. 
Shifty looks at Chris. 
SHIFTY Yeah, but I wouldn't mate... I don't want to... I'm perfectly fucking happy where I am... 
INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. DAY 
Glen sits perched on the end of the bed, his top off. Loretta lays on her side, behind him. 
GLEN Magnus, Magnus... 
He gets up and walks about. 
GLEN (CONT'D) ... is that better?...it's Glen... you alright... can you hear me?... yeah I'm good mate, I'm good... No, you...no mate... no I, erm, I put the word about...you know...what we were chatting about... and I, erm, I think I've got a pretty good idea what's going on... well, erm...

Little prick told me to go fuck myself, said he'll call you himself... the geezers getting out of control Magnus, something needs to be done...alright mate...alright, I'll speak to you later...cheers mate...CLICK! 
He stands there for moment, thinking. He walks over to Loretta and pulls back the sheets. He leans over and starts kissing her all over, she tries to ignore him, but he's licking her ear, grinding his crotch into her arse. 
LORETTA Glen, I'm not in the mood. 
SHIFTY Fuck that. 
CHRIS Why? 
SHIFTY You always kick off. 
CHRIS No I don't. 
SHIFTY Mate, last time you drank a bottle of whisky you pissed on my leg. 
CHRIS Bollocks! 
Chris is laughing. 
SHIFTY In a club. 
CHRIS What! 
A BEAT. 
SHIFTY In front of the bouncer. 
CHRIS Oh yeah, I remember. 
Chris cracks up. 
SHIFTY I gotta do one last drop off and we can chill out. 
93   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY 
We see Trevor walk back to the van, in his hand he has a can of beer. Getting in, he settles down and begins to unwrap his gram of coke on the passenger seat. He places down the can to take a hit when suddenly he knocks it, spilling beer all over the cocaine. 
TREVOR No, no, no, no, oh fuck, oh fucking hell. 
He's at it. His fingers dabbing at the clammy remnants, fingering it into his gums and teeth. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) Fuck...fuck...

Trevor gets out, he's furious and kicks the side of the van.

97   INT. BLAIR'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. DAY 
We're at Blair Wyards, 35. His room is full of twelve inch vinyl and cool framed posters. They all sit around on low comfy chairs. Blair smokes on a stacked spliff. 
SHIFTY How many do you want?

SHIFTY How about four! 
BLAIR Do me a favour, Jesus Christ. 
98   EXT. STREET. DAY 
Malik walks, head down, carrying the bag of stolen gear. 
CHRIS So he's fucked either way. 
Blair and Chris laugh. 
SHIFTY Ha Dee fucking Ha... wankers. 
Shifty sits back in his chair, thinking. 
102   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY 
They're driving. Trevor almost fanatical, eyes searching - Malik in the back of the car, looking anxious, offering directions. 
103   INT. TREVOR'S VAN. DAY 
Trevor scours the streets, Malik in the back. The house tune thumping out. 
104   INT. BLAIR'S HOUSE / FRONT ROOM. DAY 
Blair sniffs up a line of coke and offers some to Shifty and Chris who decline. The mellow tunes plays out. Chris passes the spliff to Blair who takes a deep drag. Shifty sits back and looks at the clock on the wall. It reads 18:45. He thinks for a moment. He looks at the lines of coke lined up on Blair's table. He looks back at the clock. 18:46. Chris is watching Shifty. 
CHRIS I tell you what? 
SHIFTY What? 
CHRIS I could fucking smash one of your mum's curry's. 
Shifty looks at Chris straight in the eyes. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Do you think she would have made food? 
SHIFTY Always. 
A BEAT. 
CHRIS We could still make it, man. 
Shifty looks at Chris. 
A BEAT. 
105   INT. SHIFTY'S PARENTS HOUSE. DAY 
Rez stands in the hallway of his parents house, we can see Shifty's parents in the kitchen chatting to an elderly gentleman in a suit. Rez looks at his phone, it reads: Shafiq Mobile. He looks at it for a while. Then answers. 
SHIFTY (O.S.) Rez, it's Shifty 
REZ Yeah. 
SHIFTY (O.S.) Where are you? 
REZ Mum and dads. 
106   EXT. STREET. DAY

107   INT. SHIFTY'S PARENTS HOUSE / HALLWAY. DAY 
Trevor's eyes are bulging, face crimson with rage, his knife nestling at the tip of Shifty's Adams apple. 
TREVOR Empty your fucking other pockets!... NOW....NOW! 
Shifty does what Trevor says. 
TREVOR (CONT'D) And the inside pockets you prick... NOW! 
At that moment, Trevor lowers his knife, Shifty takes heed and grabs him, swinging him around and pushinhg his palm into Trevor's face. They fall into a messy clinch, but their now facing the opposite way. Chris and Shifty turn and sprint as fast as possible. Trevor falls to his knees scrambling for the drugs. 
CUT TO: 
110   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / FRONTROOM. DAY 
Jasmine is in the front room ironing. In front of her she has two suit cases laid out perfectly. She keeps and eye on the kids who are still painting. She presses one of Trevor's shirts perfectly. 
EXT. OLD SPORTS CENTRE. DAY 
Shifty and Chris come to rest behind a gathering of bushes. Their lungs on fire as they grab for air. Shifty looks down at his top and realises he's bleeding. 
SHIFTY Oh shit. 
CHRIS Mate, are you alright? 
Chris reaches to help him, but Shifty swats away his hand. 
SHIFTY Get off me, man. 
CHRIS Mate, I'm only trying to help. 
SHIFTY It's a bit fucking late now. 
CHRIS Mate, the geezer had a fucking knife at your throat. 
SHIFTY Yeah exactly mate. Help might have been fucking nice, do you know what I mean? 
CHRIS What was I supposed to do? 
SHIFTY You're supposed to fucking help me, man, fucking do something. 
CHRIS Mate, I'm sorry, I'm just not used to being fucking mugged in tunnels. It's not part of my daily routine? 
SHIFTY I'm surprised you didn't do a fucking runner? 
CHRIS What are you talking about? 
SHIFTY I'm surprised you didn't fucking... run off and leave me to sort out the mess. 
CHRIS Fuck you, Shifty. Fuck you, man. 
SHIFTY Why, why, cos I'm speaking the truth. Talking about the past, talking about Serena. Oh no you can't talk about that, you mustn't talk about Serena. 
A BEAT.

Let's talk about how you left two weeks after she died without saying goodbye to me, everyone fucking asking me what's going on, every one saying shit about you, bad mouthing you, let me tell you about the fights I had sticking up for you, the broken nose I got when some meathead slagged you off, let's fucking talk about that, mate.

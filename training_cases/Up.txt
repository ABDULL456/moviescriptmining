A 1930's NEWSREEL. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) "Movietown News" presents... Spotlight on Adventure! 
The mysterious SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLE. A massive waterfall cascades down a gigantic, flat-topped mountain. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) What you are now witnessing is footage never before seen by civilized humanity: a lost world in South America! Lurking in the shadow of majestic Paradise Falls, it sports plants and animals undiscovered by science. Who would dare set foot on this inhospitable summit? 
A painted portrait of a dashing young adventurer. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Why, our subject today: Charles Muntz! 
A massive DIRIGIBLE descends on an airfield. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The beloved explorer lands his dirigible, the "Spirit of Adventure," in New Hampshire this week, completing a year long expedition to the lost world! 
INT. MOVIE THEATRE - CONTINUOUS 
Of everyone watching in the modest, small town theater, no one is more enthralled than 8 year old CARL FREDRICKSEN. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (O.S.) This lighter-than-air craft was designed by Muntz himself, and is longer than 22 Prohibition paddy- wagons placed end to end. 
Young Carl stares, mouth agape, wearing leather flight helmet and goggles -- just like his idol on the silver screen. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And here comes the adventurer now! 
NEWSREEL FOOTAGE: the dashing Muntz descends down the gangplank to the delight of the crowd. His dogs trail him. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Never apart from his faithful dogs, Muntz conceived the craft for canine comfort! It's a veritable floating palace in the sky... 
An opulent dining room. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...complete with doggie bath and mechanical canine walker. 
One dog runs suffers through mechanized bath time, while a second wears an electrode helmet and runs on a treadmill. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And Jiminy Cricket, do the locals consider Muntz the bee's knees! And how! 
Cameras flash as Muntz stands heroic, striking his signature "thumbs up" stance. 
MUNTZ "Adventure is out there!" 
In the theater, Young Carl returns the thumbs up. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) But what has Muntz brought back this time? 
Muntz speaks to a crowded auditorium, on stage beside a curtained object. 
MUNTZ Gentlemen, I give you: the Monster of Paradise Falls! 
He pulls away the drape to reveal a GIANT BIRD SKELETON. 
CROWD Ooh! Young Carl leans forward, eyes bulging. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) And golly, what a swell monster this is. But what's this? 
Skeptical scientists analyze the bones. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Scientists cry foul! The National Explorers Society accuses Muntz of fabricating the skeleton! 
YOUNG CARL No! 
Muntz's portrait is removed from a wall of paintings of other famous explorers. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The organization strips Muntz of his membership. 
Muntz's "Explorer's Society" badge is ceremoniously RIPPED from his jacket. Carl GASPS. 
Muntz stands next to his dirigible at an airfield.       He grimly addresses the crowd. 
NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Humiliated, Muntz vows a return to Paradise Falls and promises to capture the beast... alive! 
Carl FUMPHERS. 
YOUNG ELLIE Alright, you're in. Welcome aboard. She offers her hand.   Carl looks down, embarrassed. 
YOUNG ELLIE What's wrong? Can't you talk? Carl is frozen.   Ellie softens. 
YOUNG ELLIE Hey, I don't bite. She takes off her helmet.   Her hair frizzes out in all directions. She removes a homemade GRAPE SODA CAP pin from her shirt and pins it on Carl. 
YOUNG ELLIE You and me, we're in a club now. 
Carl smiles. 
YOUNG ELLIE I saw where your balloon went. Come on, let's go get it! 
Carl watches her stride out of the room.   She pops back in. 
YOUNG ELLIE My name's Ellie. 
She grabs his hand. Carl blushes as she pulls him out of the room. 
INT. DILAPIDATED HOUSE, UPSTAIRS 
YOUNG ELLIE There it is. 
Carl and Ellie look across the attic at the balloon. Between them the floor has collapsed, save one rickety beam. Carl GULPS. 
YOUNG ELLIE Well, go ahead. She pushes him out onto the beam. 
YOUNG ELLIE Go on. 
Carl steels his courage. He puts on his goggles, starts forward... and FALLS through the floor. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SMALL TOWN NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY 
Ambulance.    SIREN blaring. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
One lone light on upstairs. 
INT. CARL'S ROOM 
Carl in bed, reading a book by flashlight, his arm in a CAST. 
Into the room floats Carl's lost BLUE BALLOON. Carl jumps and CALLS OUT in fright. 
YOUNG CARL (re: arm) Ow! 
A head pops up from outside the open window. 
YOUNG ELLIE Hey kid!! 
Carl SCREAMS, hitting himself in the face with the cast. 
YOUNG CARL Ow!! 
Ellie climbs in the window. 
YOUNG ELLIE Thought you might need a little cheerin' up. I got somethin' to show ya! 
INT. CARL'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The two hunker under a blanket tent with a flashlight.   Ellie whispers, as if to protect a National Secret. 
YOUNG ELLIE I am about to let you see something I have never shown to another human being. Ever. In my life. Carl's eyes widen in alarm. 
YOUNG ELLIE You'll have to swear you will not tell anyone. Carl nods. 
YOUNG ELLIE Cross your heart. Do it! Carl crosses.    Ellie unveils... 
YOUNG ELLIE My Adventure Book! It's a reused photo album with the words "My Adventure Book" written across it. She opens it to a photo of Charles Muntz. 
YOUNG ELLIE You know him. Carl smiles excitedly. 
YOUNG ELLIE Charles Muntz, explorer. When I get big, I'm going where he's going: South America. She turns the page to a map. 
RUSSELL Two blocks down! Got it! 
Russell runs down the block clapping and calling. 
RUSSELL Sniiiipe! Here Snipey Snipey... 
CARL (calls after Russell) Bring it back here when you find it! Carl rolls his eyes and begins to close his door. 
He stops short. 
A large truck is backing up, getting dangerously close to 
ELLIE'S MAILBOX. 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE Okay, keep her coming... And... stop. Stop! STOP!! The truck hits Ellie's mailbox, crushing the front. 
Carl is shocked.   He runs to the box. 
CARL What? Hey! Hey you!         What do you think you're doing? 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE I am so sorry, sir... 
The worker bangs on the mailbox, trying to fix it. 
CARL Don't touch that! 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE No no, let me take care of that for you. 
Carl grabs the mailbox, trying to wrestle it from the worker. 
CARL 
(STRUGGLING) Get away from our mailbox! 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER STEVE Hey sir, I... 
CARL I don't want you to touch it! Carl HITS the worker with his cane.      He falls to the sidewalk. The worker rubs his head.    Blood. 
Carl backs up toward his door, cradling his mailbox.     What has he done? 
Passerbys stare. Workers gather, as does the REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER. 
Carl backs into his house. 
INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM 
Carl shuts his door.   He closes the curtains. He peeks out the window. The injured worker is helped to his feet. A police car pulls up. 
The Real Estate Developer looks toward Carl's house.     His hand rests on Carl's fence. 
INT. COURTHOUSE HALLWAY - DAY 
Carl sits alone on a bench holding a Court Summons. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
A GUARD opens the door. Carl enters.    The REAL ESTATE DEVELOPER watches him enter. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE - LATE EVENING 
A Police Officer drops Carl at his front gate. 
OFFICER EDITH Sorry Mr. Fredricksen. You don't seem like a public menace to me. Take this. 
She hands him a pamphlet for SHADY OAKS RETIREMENT VILLAGE. 
OFFICER EDITH The guys from Shady Oaks will be by to pick you up in the morning, okay? The officer drives off, leaving Carl alone. 
Carl faces the house.    He touches Ellie's dented mailbox. 
CARL What do I do now, Ellie? 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - NIGHT 
All is quiet but the slow ticking of the clock. The empty hall. 
The front hall mirror. The kitchen. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, BEDROOM WINDOW 
Sails made from stitched-together curtains emerge from the windows and billow in the wind. Carl steers using ropes attached to the weather vane. 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 
The compass needle rotates to point SOUTH. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE 
The house turns. Carl looks out the window, satisfied.   He checks the balloons. 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 
Carl kisses a photo of Ellie. 
CARL We're on our way, Ellie. Carl kneels at the fireplace and plunks the balloon strings tied to the grate. He CHUCKLES and settles into his chair.   He closes his eyes and smiles. SHADOWS move gently across the fireplace mantle. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING 
The house drifts through the clouds. 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 
Carl relaxes in his chair. 
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. 
CARL Huh? 
He stares at the front door.   Nothing. 
CARL Hm. 
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK. 
He bolts up and approaches the door. He looks out the peep hole. Nothing but the porch and clouds. He throws it open. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Nothing. He looks left.     Nothing.   He looks right.   Russell. He looks... Russell?!! 
RUSSELL Hi, Mr. Fredricksen.    It's me, Russell. 
CARL What are you doing out here, kid? 
Russell is plastered up against the wall, terrified and holding on for dear life. 
RUSSELL I found the snipe and I followed it under your porch, but this snipe had a long tail and looked more like a large mouse. 
The flag on Russell's backpack blows off and falls through the clouds. 
RUSSELL Please let me in? 
CARL No. 
Carl slams the door, leaving Russell alone. Beat. The door opens again. 
CARL Oh, alright, you can come... Russell runs into the house past Carl. 
CARL ...in. 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Russell PANTS, panicked.   He looks into living room. 
RUSSELL Huh. I've never been in a floating house before. 
Carl follows Russell into the living room.   Russell chuckles and points at the photo of young Ellie. 
RUSSELL Goggles.   Look at this stuff! Russell finds Ellie's house drawing sitting on the pages of the open atlas. 
RUSSELL Wow, you going on a trip? (reads from the engraving) "Paradise Falls: A Land Lost in Time." You going to South America, Mr. Fredricksen? Carl takes the page and puts it in his pocket. 
CARL Don't touch that.   You'll soil it. 
RUSSELL You know, most people take a plane, but you're smart because you'll have all your TV and clocks and stuff. Russell runs over to the steering rig. 
The photo of Ellie rocks and slides off the wall.     Carl lunges to catch it. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING 
The storm rages.    The house is tossed into the storm clouds. All goes black. 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Carl is asleep. A finger pokes Carl's face.     Nothing. 
The finger pokes Carl's face again.    Carl WAKES UP. 
RUSSELL Whew!    I thought you were dead. 
CARL Wha... what happened? 
Carl STRUGGLES to rise from the pile of Ellie's things he'd been protecting. 
RUSSELL I steered us. I did!      I steered the house! 
CARL Steered us? 
RUSSELL After you tied your stuff down you took a nap, so I went ahead and steered us down here. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW 
Carl opens the window and looks out. 
CARL Huh? 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING 
The house floats motionless above an ocean of clouds. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, WINDOW 
CARL Can't tell where we are. 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 
RUSSELL Oh we're in South America all right. It was a cinch, with my Wilderness Explorer GPS. 
Russell holds up his WILDERNESS EXPLORER GPS UNIT. 
CARL GP-what? 
RUSSELL My dad gave it to me. It shows exactly where we are on the planet. With this baby, we'll never be lost! Russell gestures, tossing the unit out the window. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING 
Carl and Russell watch the tiny GPS unit descend into the clouds. 
RUSSELL Oops. 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 
Carl kneels by the fireplace and cuts at the balloon strings. 
CARL We'll get you down, find a bus stop. You just tell the man you want to go back to your mother. 
RUSSELL Sure, but I don't think they have busses in Paradise Falls. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING 
A small cluster of balloons fly up and away from the house. 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM 
CARL There. That ought to do it. Here, I'll give you some change for bus fare. 
Russell follows Carl toward the front door. 
RUSSELL Nah, I'll just use my city bus pass. 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING 
The house lowers into the fog. 
CARL Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! Got it?! 
Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen. 
CARL You on the porch yet?! 
Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb. He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted. 
CARL What? That's it?! I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Aw, great! 
Carl paces. 
RUSSELL Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge? 
CARL What are you talking about? 
RUSSELL We could walk your house to the falls! 
CARL Walk it? 
RUSSELL Yeah, after all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. Carl considers this. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE, DAY - LATER 
The house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the house and "Y"s to tie to both Carl and Russell. They wear the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk. 
CARL Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing. Russell inspects his surroundings. 
RUSSELL 
(DISTRACTED) Uh-huh. 
CARL We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens... 
RUSSELL Sand! 
CARL ...we're not getting to the falls! 
RUSSELL I found sand! 
Carl ROLLS HIS EYES.    He looks up at the house. 
CARL Don't you worry, Ellie.    We'll get our house over there. Russell looks up at the house.   Who's Carl talking to? 
RUSSELL Huh. (shrugs it off) This is fun already, isn't it? By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!! 
The WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl's hearing aid. 
RUSSELL Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls again? 
CARL Hey, let's play a game. It's called: "See who can be quiet the longest." 
RUSSELL Cool!   My mom loves that game! 
They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY 
Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape. Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks. 
Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.   Each has a light. Hunters. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS 
The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire. 
The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS 
The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS. 
They surround the prey.   Escape looks impossible. WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the three dogs and escaping in a flash. 
The dogs head off in pursuit. A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears wincing in pain. They whimper and run off. 
RUSSELL Come on. Don't be afraid little snipe. Nice snipe. Good little snipe. Nice... A massive shadowy creature rises up over Russell. 
RUSSELL ...giant snipe! 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, THICK JUNGLE CLEARING 
Carl checks the knot on his hose harness.    Russell and the massive creature step up behind him. 
RUSSELL I found the snipe! 
CARL (humoring him) Oh, did you? 
RUSSELL Are they tall? 
CARL Oh yes, they're very tall. 
RUSSELL Do they have a lot of colors? 
CARL They do indeed. 
RUSSELL Do they like chocolate? 
CARL Oh ye-   Chocolate? 
Carl turns to look. Next to Russell stands a 13 foot tall, multicolored BIRD. 
Carl SCREAMS. 
CARL What is that thing?! 
RUSSELL It's a snipe! 
CARL There's no such thing as a snipe! 
RUSSELL But you said snipes eat-- 
Carl grabs Russell, pulling him away from the bird. 
The bird HISSES at Carl and grabs Russell back.   It cradles Russell like a baby. 
RUSSELL Whoah! Russell GIGGLES. 
Carl pokes at the bird with his cane, trying to scare it off. 
CARL Go on, get out of here. Go on! Shoo! 
The bird HISSES. It takes Russell up into a tree, swinging him around playfully. It looks scary and fun. 
RUSSELL 
(LAUGHING) Whoah! Whoah! 
CARL Careful, Russell! 
RUSSELL 
(LAUGHING) Hey, look Mr. Fredricksen, it likes me! 
CARL Russell! The bird grooms Russell. 
RUSSELL 
(LAUGHING) No stop, that tickles! 
Carl pokes the bird with his cane. 
CARL Get out of here.    Go on, git! 
The bird sets Russell down.     It stalks Carl, HISSING and ruffling its feathers. 
CARL Aaaah! 
RUSSELL Uh-oh! No no no no no Kevin, it's okay. Mr. Fredricksen is nice! 
Russell pats Carl on the head. 
CARL "Kevin"? 
VOICE I can smell you. 
Carl stops. 
CARL What?    You can smell us? 
VOICE I can smell you. 
As they get closer, they realize the man is in fact a ROCK. 
CARL Hey. 
Russell GIGGLES. 
RUSSELL You were talking to a rock. Russell points to another rock shape. 
RUSSELL Hey, that one looks like a turtle! 
Sure enough. 
RUSSELL Look at that one!     That one looks like a dog! The "rock" walks forward. 
RUSSELL It is a dog! 
CARL What? 
RUSSELL Uh, we're not allowed to have dogs in my apartment. The dog nuzzles Russell, who nervously pets it. 
RUSSELL Hey, I like dogs! 
CARL (calls out) We have your dog! (to self) Wonder who he belongs to? 
RUSSELL Sit boy. 
The dog sits. 
RUSSELL Hey look, he's trained!    Shake! 
The dog raises his paw and Russell shakes it. 
RUSSELL Uh-huh.    Speak. 
DUG Hi there. 
Carl and Russell freeze. 
CARL Did that dog just say "Hi there?" 
DUG Oh yes. Carl JUMPS back. 
DUG My name is Dug. I have just met you and I love you. 
Dug jumps up on to Carl. 
CARL Uh..wha? 
Dug wears a high-tech collar. The dog's thoughts come out of it as words through a speaker. It can talk. Unfortunately, it talks non-stop. 
DUG My master made me this collar. He is a good and smart master and he made me this collar so that I may talk -- SQUIRREL!! Dug stares transfixed at a tree.    False alarm. 
DUG My master is good and smart. 
CARL It's not possible. 
DUG Oh it is, because my master is smart. 
RUSSELL Cool! What do these do, boy? 
He inspects the collar and twists a dial. 
DUG Hey would you- 
(CLICK) -cuerdo con tigo- 
(CLICK) I use that collar- 
(CLICK) -watashi wa hanashi ma- 
DUG Hi Alpha.    Hey, your voice sounds funny. 
ALPHA I know, I know!   Have you seen the bird? 
DUG Why yes, the bird is my prisoner now. 
GAMMA Yeah, right. 
The screen view adjusts to see the bird.   It hisses. 
ALPHA Impossible! Where are you?! 
DUG I am here with the bird and I will bring it back and then you will like me. Oh, gotta go. On the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boy's face. It's Russell. 
RUSSELL (on video screen) Hey Dug! Who you talking to? 
The video screen goes blank.   The dogs BARK excitedly. 
BETA What's Dug doing? 
GAMMA Why's he with that small mailman? 
BETA Where are they? 
Alpha pushes a button on Beta's collar.    A TRACKING DEVICE locates Dug. 
ALPHA There he is. Come on! 
The dogs sprint off into the jungle. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE - DAY 
The bird drags Dug, still clamped onto it's leg. 
DUG Oh please oh please oh PLEASE be my prisoner! 
RUSSELL Dug, stop bothering Kevin! 
DUG That man there says I can take the bird and I love that man there like he is my master. 
The bird HISSES. 
CARL I am not your master! 
The bird tries to shake Dug off its leg.   Dug jumps up on it. 
DUG I am warning you, once again, bird! 
RUSSELL Hey!     Quit it! 
DUG I am jumping on you now, bird. 
Russell tries to separate them, which pulls on Carl's tether. 
CARL Russell! At this rate we'll never get to the falls! 
Carl pulls on the tether, knocking Russell over.   Carl falls, pulling the house into a tall rock. SMASH! Carl GASPS.   He turns his anger to the group. 
CARL I am nobody's master, got it? (points to bird) I don't want you here, (points to Dug) ...and I don't want you here. (points to Russell) I'm stuck with you. And if you two don't clear out of here by the time I count to three- Dug sees the tennis balls on Carl's cane. 
DUG A ball!   Oh boy oh boy!     A ball! 
CARL Ball? Carl pops off one of the tennis balls. 
CARL You want it boy?     Huh?   Huh?   Yeah? 
DUG Oh oh oh! Yes, I do.        I do ever so want the ball! 
CARL Go get it!! Carl throws the ball far away.    Dug chases after it. 
DUG Oh boy, oh boy! I will get it and then bring it back! 
CARL 
(WHISPERS) Quick Russell, give me some chocolate. 
RUSSELL Why? 
CARL Wait, aren't you "Super Wilderness Guy?" With the GPM's and the badges? 
RUSSELL Yeah, but... can I tell you a secret? 
CARL No. 
RUSSELL Alright, here goes. I never actually built a tent before. There. I said it. 
CARL You've been camping before, haven't you? 
RUSSELL Well, never outside. 
CARL Well, why didn't you ask your Dad how to build a tent? 
RUSSELL I don't think he wants to talk about this stuff. 
CARL Why don't you try him sometime? Maybe he'll surprise you. 
RUSSELL Well, he's away a lot.   I don't see him much. 
CARL He's got to be home sometime. 
RUSSELL Well, I called, but Phyllis told me I bug him too much. 
CARL Phyllis? You call your own mother by her first name? 
RUSSELL Phyllis isn't my mom. Carl realizes he put his foot in it. 
CARL Oh. 
The two sit silently together, watching the fire. 
RUSSELL But he promised he'd come to my Explorer ceremony to pin on my Assisting the Elderly badge, so he can show me about tents then, right? 
Carl studies Russell's sad optimism.   He looks at the missing badge on Russell's sash. 
CARL Hey, uh, why don't you get some sleep. Don't want to wake up the traveling flea circus. 
Dug nuzzles around the sleeping bird's leg. 
RUSSELL Mr. Fredricksen, Dug says he wants to take Kevin prisoner. We have to protect him! 
Russell YAWNS and lies down on the rock next to Carl. 
RUSSELL Can Kevin go with us? 
CARL Alright.   He can come. 
RUSSELL Promise you won't leave him? 
CARL Yeah. 
RUSSELL Cross your heart? 
Carl looks down at Russell. 
CARL Cross my heart. 
Carl sits at the campfire, the others asleep.    He shakes his head and looks up at the house. 
CARL What have I got myself into, Ellie? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, FLAT ROCKY AREA - MORNING 
A frog sits next to Carl's glasses. It CROAKS. Carl's hand smacks it like an alarm clock. The frog hops away. 
Carl rises, looking up at the house. 
CARL Morning Sweetheart. 
The balloons on the house are wilting. 
CARL We better get moving. 
He scans the camp.   The bird is gone. 
Alpha BARKS angrily. 
ALPHA You lost it. Why do I not have a surprised feeling? Well, at least you now have lead us to the small mailman and The One Who Smells of Prunes. 
Carl and Russell look at Dug.    He turned on them!   Dug shamefully lowers his head. 
ALPHA Master will be most pleased we have found them, and will ask of them many questions. (commanding, to Carl) Come! 
CARL Wait, we're not going with you. We're going to the falls! Gamma and Beta BARK fiercely at Carl. 
CARL Get away from me! Get down! 
The dogs lead Carl and Russell like prisoners.    Dug follows. The house is pulled after them, and on the roof: THE BIRD. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, DESOLATE ROCKY AREA - DAY 
Alpha leads Carl and Russell through a canyon. 
Dogs patrol the tops of the canyon walls. Four more large dogs join the group.    Carl and Russell watch warily and continue their march. 
They round a bend.     Before them is a MASSIVE CAVE OPENING. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, CAVE ENTRANCE 
The house and balloon canopy are dwarfed as the group approaches the huge cave opening. 
DOZENS OF DOGS step out of the cave. Carl and Russell stop. More dogs approach from the side. Every way Carl turns there are more dogs! 
Growling and snarling, the dogs surround Carl and Russell. Closer... closer... 
From the darkness a voice: 
VOICE (O.S.) Stay! 
The dogs stop. A figure peers out from the darkness.      It examines Carl, Russell, and the floating house. 
VOICE You came here in that? 
CARL Uh... yeah. 
VOICE In a house? A floating house? The man laughs.   Carl and Russell laugh along nervously. 
VOICE That is the darndest thing I've ever seen! You're not after my bird, are you? But if you need to borrow a cup of sugar, I'd be happy to oblige! The dogs LAUGH uproariously at the man's joke. 
VOICE Well, this is all a misunderstanding. My dogs made a mistake. 
The figure walks out toward Carl into the light.   Carl recognizes him! 
CARL Wait, are you Charles Muntz?! 
MUNTZ Well... Yes. 
CARL The Charles Muntz? 
Muntz gives him the "thumbs up." 
MUNTZ "Adventure is out there!" 
Carl GIGGLES with glee. 
CARL It's really him! (to Russell) That's Charles Muntz! 
RUSSELL 
(EXCITED) It is?!? 
(CONSIDERS) Who's Charles Muntz? 
CARL Him! 
DOG WALLA Yes!    It is him! He is! 
CARL I'm Carl Fredricksen. My wife and I, we were your biggest fans! 
Carl rushes to shake Muntz's hand.    Muntz is charmed. 
MUNTZ Well, you're a man of good taste! 
MUNTZ Hm, excellent choice. (to Carl) I found it on safari with Roosevelt. Two dogs work together to remove the cork from the bottle. POP! They sloppily pour two glasses. 
MUNTZ He and I fell into a habit of playing gin rummy in the evenings. And did he cheat? Oh, he was horrible! 
Muntz and Carl LAUGH.   Alpha interrupts. 
ALPHA (high-pitched voice) Master, dinner is ready. 
MUNTZ Oh dear, broken translator.   It's that loose wire again. (leans down, fixes it) There you go big fella. 
ALPHA (deep scary voice) Thank you Master. Russell reacts. 
RUSSELL I liked his other voice. Muntz LAUGHS. 
MUNTZ Well, dinner is served!    Right this way. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, DINING ROOM 
Muntz leads Carl and Russell into the dining room and up to a large table. 
MUNTZ So how are things stateside? Almost tempted to go back a few times, but I have unfinished work here... Please. Dogs pull back chairs for them.   They sit.   Dog waiters place napkins on their laps. 
MUNTZ I hope you're hungry because Epsilon is the finest chef I've ever had. Dogs bring out covered plates, look at each other, and remove the silver plate covers at the same time. The meals look delicious. 
MUNTZ Oh, Epsilon, you've done it again! 
RUSSELL Yes!! Russell is served a hot dog.   His waiter can't resist and eats a bite. 
RUSSELL Hey! 
Another dog pours some juice then takes a big slurp from his glass. 
RUSSELL Hey! 
Carl looks around, still enthralled. 
CARL Oh my Ellie would have loved all this. You know, it's because of you she had this dream to come down here and live by Paradise Falls. 
He gestures toward HIS HOUSE, tethered outside the porthole window. 
MUNTZ I'm honored. And now you've made it! 
CARL You're sure we're not a bother? I'd hate to impose. 
MUNTZ No no! It's a pleasure to have guests -- a real treat. 
The dogs erupt into excited barking. 
DOG WALLA Treat?!   Treat! I want a treat! 
MUNTZ No no, quiet! Calm down.     Calm down... In the excitement a dog swipes the rest of Russell's hot dog. 
RUSSELL Hey! 
MUNTZ 
(CONT'D) Shouldn't've used that word... Having guests is a delight. More often I get thieves, come to steal what's rightfully mine. 
CARL No! 
Muntz picks up a lantern and walks to the back of the room. 
MUNTZ They called me a fraud, those... dah! But once I bring back this creature, my name will be cleared. The lantern illuminates photographs, drawings, samples, feathers. Hundreds of them... all of THE BIRD. Kevin. 
This is Muntz's obsession. He looks over to a full size skeleton. 
MUNTZ Beautiful, isn't it? I've spent a lifetime tracking it. Sometimes years go by between sightings... 
(MORE) 
MUNTZ (cont'd) I've tried to smoke it out of that deathly labyrinth where it lives... Can't go in after it. Once in, there's no way out. Lost so many dogs... Muntz is lost in reverie. 
MUNTZ And here they come, these bandits, and think the bird is theirs to take! But they soon find that this mountain is a very dangerous place. 
Distracted Russell finally notices the skeleton. 
RUSSELL Hey, that looks like Kevin! 
RUSSELL They're coming! 
Carl and Russell run toward the cave opening. Dogs block the cave opening.        Carl stops short. 
DUG (O.S.) Master, over here! 
Dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave.     Carl and Russell run toward him. 
The cave leads to a steep incline.      The dogs are getting closer. There's no choice but to JUMP. 
The lift from the overhead balloons allows Carl and Russell to leap down the incline, like astronauts. 
DUG Go toward the light, master! Dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on Carl and Russell. 
The bird sees the dogs. She jumps off the house and lifts Carl and Russell on her back. She runs through the cave, towing the house behind her. Russell and Carl HANG ON for dear life. 
BANG BANG BANG! Balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling. The house lowers. 
Ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. Carl tugs at the house but it CRASHES against the rock, pulling Russell onto the ground. 
CARL Russell! 
Dragging on the ground, Russell gets BUMPED around badly. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, CANYON - CONTINUOUS 
The dogs close in on Russell. Alpha bites at his heels. Carl fends off Alpha with his cane. 
CARL Get back!! Alpha is about to bite when an avalanche of boulders rains down! The dogs stop short. 
Carl looks back as the bird keeps running.      Dug is up on the canyon wall. He caused the avalanche! 
DUG Go on Master!       I will stop the dogs! Dug jumps down to block the path of the approaching dogs. 
DUG Stop you dogs!! 
The dogs run around Dug. 
Alpha bites Dug by the neck and throws him out of the path. 
The bird carries Carl, Russell dragging along behind.    She rounds a corner. Russell SWINGS OUT over the abyss. 
The bird jumps from rock spire to spire.   Russell swings back and forth wildly in the air. 
RUSSELL Help! Help! 
Russell does the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL. 
CARL Gimme your hand! Carl holds out his cane so that Russell can GRAB it and Carl PULLS him back onto the bird. Meanwhile Dug manages to rejoin his friends, but just in time to reach the end of the line -- A CLIFF EDGE.   A river winds 100 feet below. 
Carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward. 
RUSSELL Hang on to Kevin! 
Carl grabs onto Kevin and picks Dug up by the collar. 
Just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries them across the chasm. Alpha bites the bird on the leg but is kicked loose and falls into the river below. 
Carl LANDS HARD but safely across the river chasm.     The dogs are stuck on the other side. Carl painfully gets up.    He looks up at his house.   It's still intact. 
He breathes a SIGH OF RELIEF. 
RUSSELL (O.S.) Kevin! 
The bird tries to stand but SQUAWKS pitifully and falls back to the ground. Russell rushes to her side. 
The bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite.   She can't stand. 
Russell applies a bandage. 
From the distant labyrinth of rocks, the BIRD BABIES call. Kevin CALLS back to them. She tries to stand, but can't. 
Russell runs to her side. 
RUSSELL No no no! Kevin! Stay down. (to Carl) She's hurt real bad. Can't we help her get home? 
Carl looks at the bird's wounds.   He looks to the rock maze, then to his house. He knows the right thing to do.    And he hates himself for it. 
RUSSELL Run Kevin! Run! 
A net shoots out and binds her. She falls and CALLS OUT. 
RUSSELL Oh no! 
The net catches on a rock. Carl and Russell run to her aid. 
CARL Russell, give me your knife! 
Carl saws frantically at the net. 
MUNTZ (O.S.) Get away from my bird! 
Muntz and his dogs descend from the dirigible.     Beside them, a group of dogs drag forward CARL'S HOUSE. 
Muntz hurls a lit lantern.      Flames burst up beneath the house. 
Heat waves ripple up.   Balloons POP.    Carl's house LOWERS into the fire. 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Inside the living room, Ellie's photo crashes to the floor. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, LABYRINTH GATE - CONTINUOUS 
CARL No! 
Carl panics.    He rushes toward the house, dropping the knife. 
Muntz motions to the dogs. They swarm past Russell, knocking him down and grabbing the bird in the net. 
RUSSELL No! Carl pulls his house away from the flames. 
The bird CALLS OUT plaintively as the dogs drag her into the dirigible. 
Muntz follows the bird up the ramp of the dirigible. 
MUNTZ Careful. We want her in good shape for my return. 
RUSSELL Let her go! Stop! 
Russell runs after the dogs, but the gangplank closes. The dirigible flies off. 
RUSSELL Kevin! Carl beats out the flames with his jacket.     He extinguishes the flames. 
Carl collapses on the side of his house. 
RUSSELL You gave away Kevin.   You just gave her away. 
CARL This is none of my concern.      I didn't ask for any of this! 
DUG Master.   It's alright. 
CARL I am not your master! And if you hadn't a shown up, none of this would have happened! Bad dog! Bad dog! 
Dug slinks off, tail between his legs. Carl angrily puts on the harness. 
CARL Now, whether you assist me or not, I am going to Paradise Falls if it kills me. 
He walks off.   Russell falls in behind. An angry dawn breaks. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY TERRAIN - DAY 
Now barely aloft, Carl pulls the house across the rocky landscape. 
Russell's harness drags along side, empty. 
Russell walks behind. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN HILLSIDE - MORNING 
With the last of his energy, Carl drags the house into place. The house groans as it comes to rest. 
Carl drops the hose harness and walks to the edge of a cliff. 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS - MORNING 
Inside the house, Carl adjusts his steering, scans the skies. 
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK.    Carl's eyes go wide. 
CARL Russell? 
INT. CARL'S HOUSE, PORCH - CONTINUOUS 
The door swings open. 
CARL Dug! 
DUG I was hiding under your porch because I love you. Can I stay? 
CARL Can you stay? Well, you're my dog aren't you? And I'm your master! 
DUG You are my master?! Dug lunges forward and overwhelms Carl with dog kisses. 
DUG Oh boy.     Oh boy! 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FLOATING - CONTINUOUS 
The house flies off into the sky. 
CARL (O.S.) Good boy, Dug. You're a good boy! 
EXT. OPEN SKY - DAY 
Russell steers through the clouds toward the DIRIGIBLE. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS 
Dogs play poker. Behind them, Russell flies past with the leaf blower. They turn to look. 
EXT. DIRIGIBLE 
Russell steers wobbly toward an open dirigible window.    He smashes into the wall. 
RUSSELL Ooph! 
He tries again and TUMBLES through the window. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS 
Russell releases the balloons and picks up the leaf blower, ready for action. 
RUSSELL Yes!    Don't worry Kevin! I'll save - Growling dogs move toward him. 
Russell blows the leaf blower at the dogs. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM 
Muntz stares into the bird's cage, mesmerized.     She's miserable and scared. 
MUNTZ And they wouldn't believe me. Just wait till they get a look at you. 
Alpha enters. 
ALPHA Master! The small mailman has returned. 
MUNTZ What? 
INT. DIRIGIBLE 
Dogs tie Russell to a chair. 
RUSSELL Let me go! 
Muntz enters. 
MUNTZ Where's your elderly friend? 
Russell blows the leaf blower in Muntz's face. 
RUSSELL He's not my friend anymore. 
Muntz grabs the leaf blower and drags Russell out. 
DUG Uh... POINT! Dug points to a grate in the wall. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, GAS CELL AREA 
Dug leads Carl "backstage" through a vent shaft into the dirigible. They sneak past two biplanes. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM 
They emerge through a grate near the ceiling. They look down into the room where the bird is kept in a cage. 
CARL Kevin! 
The bird recognizes Carl and CRIES OUT. 
CARL Don't worry Kevin, we're on our way! Alpha enters, leading a group of dogs. Carl and Dug duck into the shadows and watch unnoticed from above. 
ALPHA Allow no one to be entering through these doors. Guard well that bird, my minions. 
CARL 
(WHISPERS) What do we do now, Dug? 
Dug is lost in ecstacy, chomping on a tennis ball on the end of Carl's cane. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Carl drops down from the ceiling and stands on the cage.      He bangs his cane. All the dogs turn. He grabs a ball from his cane and waves it in the air. 
CARL Who wants the ball? 
DOGS Me! I do! I want the ball! 
CARL Then go get it! Carl throws the ball.    The dogs scramble after it. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The dogs pile into the hallway in pursuit. 
DOGS I'm gonna get there first! Oh gonna get the ball! I'm gonna get it! 
Gamma catches it.. 
GAMMA I got it!! 
Behind them Carl shuts the door.    The dogs realize their mistake. 
GAMMA Uh-oh. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, CAGE ROOM 
Carl opens the cage door. 
CARL I'm sorry Kevin.      Let's get you out of here. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT 
Muntz scans the horizon.    Suddenly the in-ship communicator comes to life. 
DOG WALLA (on radio) Master! He's gone! The old man! He's here! He's got the bird! The bird's gone! 
MUNTZ What?    Calm down!   One at a time! 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE, FRONT PORCH 
Russell STRUGGLES to break free of the chair. 
RUSSELL I want to help! He manages to get his arms free. 
RUSSELL Ha ha! 
Except that all his struggling causes the chair to hop out on the porch and fall off. 
Russell SCREAMS as he falls.     The hose unspools. 
Russell reaches the end of the hose. Russell grabs onto it and the chair jostles free, falling thousands of feet down. 
The house drifts away from the dirigible. 
MUNTZ Enough! I'm taking that bird back with me alive or dead! Carl trips and falls to the floor.     Muntz is about to deal the final blow. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT 
Meanwhile Alpha backs Dug into the control panel.        He bumps a a LEVER. 
EXT. DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS 
The entire dirigible rocks wildly to the side. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, TROPHY ROOM 
Muntz is knocked off balance.     He slides to one side.    Trophy cases slide after him. The dirigible tilts to the other side. 
The broken trophy cases barrel straight toward Carl! Carl is thrown into a window which bursts open. Carl falls through but manages to grab the frame with his cane. He dangles out over open air. He sees the biplanes circling the house, Russell hanging beneath it. 
The ship corrects again.      Carl climbs back inside. Muntz comes at Carl. 
CARL Come on, Kevin! 
EXT. SIDE OF DIRIGIBLE - CONTINUOUS 
Carl climbs the work ladder up the side of the dirigible.    He pushes the bird along as he goes. 
Muntz follows up. 
INT. DIRIGIBLE, COCKPIT 
Alpha throws Dug viciously across the room. Alpha throws him again and Dug crashes into the steering wheel, knocking a radar shade off the control panel. Alpha moves in.     Dug hides behind the steering wheel. 
ALPHA I will have many enjoyments for what I am about to do, Dug. 
Alpha lunges at Dug through the steering wheel.    Dug cowers, but then notices the RADAR SHADE. 
As Alpha lunges again, Dug jams the shade over Alpha's head. Alpha's head is stuck, trapped by the cone. The dogs all GASP. 
MISC DOG He wears the Cone of Shame! 
ALPHA (high-pitched voice) What? Do not just continue sitting! Attack! 
The bump caused his collar to go funny again.    The dogs all howl with laughter. 
ALPHA (high pitched voice) No! No! Stop your laughing! Get this off of me! 
DUG Listen you dog!     Sit! Surprised at Dug's moxy, Alpha sits.    All other dogs sit too. 
DOG WALLA Yes, Alpha. 
DUG Alpha? I am not Alpha, he is- 
(REALIZING) Oohhhh! 
EXT. CARL'S HOUSE 
Russell TRIES TO CLIMB the hose.   His hands are about to give out. The biplanes head straight at Russell. 
RUSSELL (out of breath) I can't do it! 
Behind him, Carl is climbing the side of the dirigible for dear life, Muntz closing in. 
CARL (far in the distance) Russell! 
RUSSELL Huh? 
Carl calls for help: the WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL. 
RUSSELL You leave Mr. Fredricksen alone! 
Russell CLIMBS! He's more machine than boy now. Biplanes shooting the whole way, he climbs up onto the porch. The biplanes close in. 
Russell yells to them. 
RUSSELL Hey! (pointing down) Squirrel! 
All the dog pilots snap to attention. 
GAMMA Squirrel?

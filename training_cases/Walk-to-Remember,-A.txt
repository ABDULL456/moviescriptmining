BLACK 
A young man's V.O.: 
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) I was born in Beaufort, North Carolina. A place where the air always smells of pine and salt and sea. 
The voice is gentle. Slightly Southern in inflection.   A young doctor's soothing manner. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. COASTAL NORTH CAROLINA (DECEMBER) (PRESENT) 
A vast view of the coastline in winter -- beaches, rivers, sea marshes, inlets -- ebbing and flowing. 
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) For many, days and nights are spent fishing Pamlico Sound or crabbing the Neuse River. 
The CAMERA FINDS a small coastal town, edged by a harbor on which fishermen toil. 
EXT. BEAUFORT, NORTH CAROLINA - MORNING (DECEMBER) 
The CAMERA, MOVING inland, CROSSES OVER modest houses decked with plastic rooftop Santas... 
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) While the ocean may be the focus of daily labor, churches have always tried to be the focus of life. 
And MOVES UPHILL TO... 
EXT. MAIN STREET 
Where fake snow is sprayed on store windows. The CAMERA CONTINUES TO the far side of Main Street -- with its stately homes with big lawns, flower beds, and tasteful Christmas garlands. 
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) When I lived here, there were eighteen churches within town limits alone. 
EXT. FOUR-WAY STOP 
From each corner, four churches face each other. The Fellowship Hall Christian Church, the Church of the Forgiven People, the Church of Sunday Atonement, and All Saints Church. 
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) They sponsored pancake breakfasts, rummage sales, car washes, and softball games. 
EXT. LANDON'S TRUCK - TRAVELING 
The CAMERA FINDS and FOLLOWS a newish sport utility vehicle with MD plates as it passes a rummage sale and a softball game. 
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) You'd think that all the people here were friendly, welcoming, open-hearted... 
Dr. LANDON CARTER, 33, drives the truck. 
INT. CAR - TRAVELING 
Landon looks urban, prosperous, well-groomed -- but retains his boyish whimsy and sense of irony. A cell phone and overnight bag on the seat next to him. 
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) ... and that money or family background or education or luck didn't matter. 
Landon reaches out to adjust his side mirror, revealing a simple gold wedding band on his left hand. 
EXT. STREET - TRAVELING 
Landon's truck turns the corner and slows in front of the huge Southern Baptist church. 
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) But they did matter. They mattered to everyone. Except Jamie Sullivan... 
Landon's truck turns into a driveway just past the church and heads for a cluster of buildings. Behind the buildings, a cemetery. 
EXT. CLUSTER OF BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
The truck pulls up in front of the old parsonage -- it's a different color than he remembers. 
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) ... Astronomer. Actress. Believer in God... 
Landon hesitates a moment, then climbs out of his truck. 
EXT. OLD PARSONAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Landon heads up the walk and onto the front porch. Presses the DOORBELL. It RINGS inside. Landon is edgy, unsettled. 
ADULT LANDON (V.O.) ... Believer in me. 
A nurse opens the door. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH GYM - NIGHT (NOVEMBER, 1985) 
ROCK MUSIC drifts out open doors -- barely recognizable as "Born in the U.S.A." Students hang. Brains, preps, richies, heavy metals, jocks, punk rockers, goths, geeks. Mixing without mixing. Most are red-eyed, woozy, wasted. A couple of boys break dance to a BOOM BOX. 
Missing are the criminals... 
A shiny T-top CAMARO ROARS up. Stops, TIRES SQUEALING. VAN HALEN BLASTING. LANDON, 18, at the wheel. He is impulsive, sexy-troubled, with the nothing-to-lose courage to act on destructive whims. He is envied, copied, feared. 
INT. CAMARO 
EMPTIES roll and CLINK on the floor. A tiny plastic skeleton dances as it hangs from the rearview mirror. Landon stamps a joint into the ashtray. 
ERIC (to Belinda) I'm just wondering -- 
BELINDA Don't wonder. 
Landon's looking out at the night. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON Jamie Sullivan. 
Everyone looks up.     Derisive laughter. 
THEIR POV 
A pale, contemplative GIRL, 17, is jumping down off the gate, caught in the headlights. Wearing clothes she probably made herself; long hair hiding her face. She lives in her mind, not her body. 
BACK TO SCENE 
BELINDA Brain. 
ERIC Bible freak. 
LANDON Cherry. 
EXT. CAMARO 
JAMIE (GIRL), hearing the laughter, gathers herself and approaches Landon's window, her SNEAKERS CRUNCHING in the GRAVEL. She crosses her pilly brown sweater across her chest. 
JAMIE (to Landon, tentative) Hey. Hi. Your lights. Any chance you could... turn them off -- 
BELINDA (leaning over Landon) God give you this road? 
JAMIE No -- 
BELINDA Then we'll be keeping the lights on. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON (to Jamie, seeming nice) If you want the lights off, I'll turn them off. 
And he does.    Darkness. 
JAMIE Thank you.   Thank you so very much. 
She backs away from the car, grateful.        From the car: 
BELINDA (O.S.) I can't see a friggin' thing. 
INT. CAMARO 
Landon switches on the dome lights for Belinda. 
BELINDA (imitating Jamie) 'Thank you. Thank you so very much.' 
But Landon's looking at Jamie.     Almost counting the seconds... 
HIS POV 
Jamie scaling the fence, practiced at it. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Landon quickly flicks the high beams.     Belinda, Eric, and Clay snicker and snort as they see -- 
EXT. CEMETERY GATE 
Jamie, startled, paused at the top. But instead of looking bullied, her face shows determination, humor even. A moment later, she jumps down on the far side. Disappears. 
INT. CAMARO 
Belinda, Eric, Clay are still laughing.       Landon's smiling. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
ERIC Ten years. Where're you gonna be? (to Belinda, mocking) Hypothetically? 
BELINDA Paris. 
CLAY Dead. 
Laughter. 
LANDON Right here.   With you. 
He clinks Eric's raised beer. More laughter. But Landon's face clouds slightly -- maybe this isn't where he'd really like to be. 
CLAY 'Twilight Zone.' 'One Step Beyond.' 'Tales from the Dark Side.' 
ERIC 'Twilight Zone,' dipshit. 
LANDON Don't call him a dipshit. 
ERIC You do -- 
LANDON And you don't. (beat, re: Jamie) What's she doing in there? 
BELINDA Nothing I'd be doing. 
Laughter.    Landon kisses her.      With tongue. 
Frightened, anguished.     The real Landon showing for an instant. 
Police SIRENS WAIL in the b.g., growing LOUDER. 
EXT. OLD CHEVETTE - HALF HOUR LATER 
A battered Chevette steers through a working-class neighborhood. 
INT. CHEVETTE 
Landon's mother, CYNTHIA, 35, drives. She's weary with sun-worn skin, but still attractive. She wears a skimpy black-and-white cocktail waitress uniform under her coat. 
CYNTHIA What if they expel you? 
LANDON Kelly wouldn't do that. 
CYNTHIA Why not? 
LANDON Cuz nothing happened at school. 
He smiles his biggest most reassuring smile. 
CYNTHIA Don't smile at me. It's not going to get you out of this. 
LANDON Why not?   It always has before. 
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - MONDAY (7:59 AM) 
By daylight, a modern brick and glass structure. 
INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - 8:05 AM 
Mr. Kelly gestures for Landon to sit.   Landon doesn't. His forehead still shows a bruise. 
MR. KELLY I had hopes for you. 
LANDON Like I'd grow up to be president, another Reagan. 
MR. KELLY (not laughing) Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average. 
LANDON I'm no dummy. 
MR. KELLY That's right.    You just act like one. 
On his desk, he places the empty bottles that rolled out of the Camaro. 
LANDON Those aren't mine. 
MR.KELLY They came from your car. 
LANDON I wasn't the one drinking. 
Kelly holds up the police test finding. 
MR. KELLY Your blood alcohol level. Maybe you were legally in the clear, but I make the rules here. 
Landon scowls, knows he's defeated. 
LANDON You expelling me? 
MR. KELLY I am. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON Now I can do what I want. 
MR. KELLY That's right. (sarcastic) The world is your oyster. 
EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - MINUTES LATER 
Landon busts out, arms high, fists tight, like a righteous political prisoner. Freedom. He struts through the courtyard. Not a care in the world. 
EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - HOUR LATER 
Landon watches a tow truck lower the crumpled Camaro. A neighbor kid, JOSH, 12, watches from across the street, on his way to school. 
EXT. CAMARO - MINUTES LATER 
Landon pokes and prods his car -- the engine, underneath, the body, the paint. A discouraging mess. 
INT. CARTER HOUSE - HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER 
Landon knocks on Cynthia's bedroom door. 
LANDON Mom.   I need a ride. 
INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM 
Dark. She wears a black eye-shield.      Her waitress uniform hangs over a chair. 
CYNTHIA (sleepy, annoyed) I'm not getting up to drive you somewhere. (beat) What're you doing home? 
EXT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER 
Landon lifts the garage DOOR. 
LANDON'S POV - INSIDE GARAGE 
A murky place.   Filled with old tools and junk and a grim old bike. 
EXT. MINI-MALL - AUTO PARTS SHOP - LITTLE LATER 
Landon comes out the glass door, his arms loaded, sees his bike. No way to carry. He looks around. The bus stop. A bus approaching. 
LANDON (grumbling) I'd work backstage or something? 
MR. KELLY Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays. 
LANDON When do I get time for me? 
MR. KELLY You don't.   That's the point. 
Landon's not happy, but he'll work with this.     As he heads for the door: 
MR. KELLY (softer, trying to reach him) Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself. (beat) Some of us remember how your father -- 
LANDON Then you remember more than I do. 
CLOSE ON BROOM 
pushing gum wrappers under a radiator. 
INT. SCIENCE CLASSROOM - AFTER SCHOOL 
Landon sweeps at the floor during the Star Club open house. A dozen nerds, including Jamie Sullivan (wearing her brown sweater), stand at astronomy exhibits. Students wander in, listen, look. 
JAMIE (answering question) -- Saturn's 15 degrees to the right of red Antares and much brighter. 
To her small audience, she holds up a contraption made from a wire coat hanger. 
JAMIE This is a very simple device made from a coat hanger, plastic wrap and typewriter correction fluid. Does anyone know what it is? 
No one does. 
LANDON (barely audible) A star frame. 
But Jamie hears.   She regards him a moment, then keeps going. 
JAMIE This is a star frame. 
Clay and Eric enter, checking on Landon, glancing at Jamie. 
JAMIE A star frame will help you locate stars and planets with your naked eye -- 
CLAY (scoffing, setting her up) -- Did God create the sun? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE (taking him seriously) Yes, God created the universe and all its physical laws. Even Einstein said it's a miracle that our world is comprehensible -- 
ERIC -- If God can do all that, why can't he get you a new sweater? 
Landon laughs loudly.    Members of the club look at him. 
LANDON That was a joke. Laugh. 
Jamie smiles.    She can laugh at herself.     And she finds Landon funny. 
INT. CARTER KITCHEN - EVENING 
Landon washes up while his mother sets the table.      The MICROWAVE HUMS in the b.g. 
CYNTHIA Your father dropped off an extra check. 
LANDON I don't want his money. 
CYNTHIA It could help with a new car -- 
LANDON -- I like the car I have. 
He picks up the envelope with wet hands. Without looking inside, rips it in half. Cynthia smiles, quietly happy. 
INT. SCHOOL BUS - TRAVELING - SATURDAY MORNING 
Enthusiastic preppies, richies, other do-gooders, singing "Karma Chameleon." Jamie sits in an aisle seat, reading, not singing. She turns around to look at Landon.    He rides in the back row, staring out the window, wearing a Sony Walkman, glum. 
HIS POV 
To Z.Z. TOP'S "Sleeping Bag." Out the window -- Jefferson High School coming into view. Bars on every window, chain-link fence around the parameter, no grass. 
INT. JEFFERSON HIGH - LIBRARY - LITTLE LATER 
A big room with tables and chairs but few books. Pairs of heads are bent over textbooks and notebooks. Landon sits with LUIS, a freshman boy of mixed ethnicity. A geometry text between them. 
LANDON (reading) -- 'So what is the measure of angle x if A and B are similar triangles?' 
Luis is lost, intimidated. 
LANDON Know what 'similar' means? 
Luis shrugs. Luis looks down at the book as if for the answer, then at Landon, hopeless. He gets up and walks off. Landon looks up in disbelief and catches Jamie studying him. She's at a nearby table with her student, ISABEL. 
INT. SCHOOL BUS - NOON 
The DOOR SWISHES SHUT behind Landon as he hops aboard. He's late and heads for the rear bench seat. 
LANDON'S POV 
Jamie sitting there.   And no vacant seats save next to her. 
BACK TO SCENE 
The bus begins to roll.   Landon lurches forward. 
TRAVELING - LATER 
The bus is moving through Beaufort. Landon sits next to Jamie. Putting a new tape into his Sony Walkman. His body turned away. She's reading her book. 
He likes the frivolity of these. 
LANDON What's... Number one? 
She looks away, embarrassed. 
JAMIE (changing subject) If you want help with your lines, I have two conditions. (smiling) You have to promise not to fall in love with me. 
He's certain she's joking. 
LANDON No problem -- 
JAMIE And you have to meet my father. 
He looks at her like she's crazy to worry about this. 
LANDON Fathers love me. 
CLOSE ON PARSONAGE FRONT DOOR 
swinging open. Reverend Sullivan looming tall.   Ichabod Crane in a collar. 
EXT. PARSONAGE PORCH - WIDER - NEXT EVENING 
Landon gives a cheery little wave. He's very sweaty.   His bike teeters on its kickstand in the b.g. 
LANDON Hey.   Landon Carter. 
Landon offers his hand. The Reverend shakes reluctantly, eyeing him closely: Landon's Army boots, torn jeans, dirty t-shirt, aloof manner. 
REV. SULLIVAN (surprised) You're in the play? 
LANDON Lead man. 
Jamie slides out the door. She looks good in jeans and a white t-shirt. Almost normal. In the b.g., Landon's BIKE CRASHES over. He bounds down the porch steps. 
LANDON (explaining bike) They took my license for 30 days. But nobody's pressing charges. 
The Reverend looks at Jamie, concerned. Landon tries the kickstand, then leans the bike against a carefully trimmed bush. Not the best place. 
JAMIE I'll get something for us to drink -- 
LANDON Don't bother! 
But she's already gone.   The Reverend gestures toward the open front door. 
INT. SULLIVAN LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Dark and prim with stiff furniture left to fade. Landon pokes around, then stares at a photo of little girl Jamie with her parents. He looks up, aware that the Reverend is studying him closely. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON You know our planet would not suffer for one nanosecond if humans died off. But if ants disappeared, that would be catastrophic. 
The Reverend waits, letting Landon suffer the silence. 
LANDON (confidence flagging) Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so -- 
REV. SULLIVAN Let's get something straight. You don't know me. I don't know you. But I know what you're about. (beat) Keep your distance from this house -- and from Jamie. 
His eyes lock with Landon's. His message clear. A NOISE and Jamie is there, carrying glasses of lemonade, all cheerful. 
JAMIE I miss anything? 
INT. PARSONAGE - KITCHEN - MINUTES LATER 
Jamie washes the lemonade glasses, happy.      Her father comes in. 
REV. SULLIVAN The Carter boy. Tell me about him. 
JAMIE He wants help with his lines -- 
REV. SULLIVAN He was driving the car that hit Harold Keene -- 
JAMIE By accident -- 
REV. SULLIVAN Jamie, he's careless. Reckless. (beat) Is this really the best time to be making a new friend...? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE I'm supposed to always be alone? 
REV. SULLIVAN I don't want you to see him outside school activities. 
JAMIE Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life. 
Pause. 
REV. SULLIVAN (gentler) I'm sorry your mother isn't here to help you become a woman. 
JAMIE Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one. 
INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM - ONE AM 
Jamie hops out of bed, pulls on jeans and a sweatshirt. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Jamie peers into her father's room. He's sleeping.     She tiptoes to the staircase and down. Sneaking out. 
EXT. REAR ACCESS ROAD TO CEMETERY - TEN MINUTES LATER 
JAMIE I hope so. (beat) I think maybe she sees me now. 
Their eyes meet.     She looks away.    Changes the subject. 
JAMIE (re: telescope) I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet -- 
LANDON The dirty snowball at its core. 
JAMIE Yeah. (beat) I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON In 76 years, me neither. 
She likes that he knows a little about astronomy. They each lean back on a tombstone and stare at the stars. 
LANDON You're really into God, right? 
JAMIE In ten words or less? 
LANDON Yeah. 
JAMIE My relationship with God is my own. 
LANDON But you think about Him -- It -- Her. 
JAMIE Don't you? 
LANDON Not really. 
Pause. 
JAMIE When you do, how do you? 
Landon could joke or he could reveal something. 
LANDON Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something. 
JAMIE Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do? 
LANDON No. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is. 
LANDON There is no point. You live.     You die. The end. 
JAMIE Maybe we're not supposed to understand, but we're supposed to have faith that someone else sees the big picture. 
LANDON You have to believe to have faith. 
JAMIE You don't believe in anything? 
LANDON The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles. 
JAMIE Interpreted by another guy like my father. 
LANDON Your father doesn't like me. 
Pause. 
JAMIE He doesn't trust you. 
LANDON Sometimes I don't even trust me. 
He sits up and pulls Rainmaker scripts from his back pocket. He holds one out to her. A moment passes. She takes it. 
JAMIE I'm not afraid of you. 
LANDON Likewise. 
INT. PARSONAGE - HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Jamie sneaks from the stairs to her room. Shuts the door. A light glows under the door, then goes out. 
INT. REVEREND SULLIVAN'S BEDROOM 
He opens his eyes, listens, then turns over and goes back to sleep. Not suspecting. Not yet. 
INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Dreary. Landon lies in bed, flipping the TV CHANNELS, past "Square Pegs," "Miami Vice," MTV, to a British nature documentary. After a moment, he searches for a pen and paper. Titles it "Life List." Pause. He doesn't know what to write. 
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH PARKING LOT - MORNING (BEFORE SCHOOL) 
Landon, Clay, Eric, Belinda. Eric's pickup is parked by Belinda's Cabriolet. RADIOS ON, BLASTING the same station, same song: JOHN FOGERTY's "Rock and Roll Girls." 
ERIC Women are definitely evolving into men. 
CLAY The moustaches on some girls. Unbelievable. 
BELINDA Why is Jamie Sullivan staring at us? 
They look.    Jamie's watching them.   They laugh. 
ERIC She wants to jump Landon's bones. 
BELINDA That is so pitiful. 
LANDON She's very confused. 
DR. CARTER Ed Kelly.    I thought we might get a bite -- 
LANDON Not hungry. 
Landon moves toward his Camaro. 
DR. CARTER Landon! Please. Don't walk away from me. 
LANDON Like you walked away from us? 
Landon opens his car door and gets in.         Not forgiving. 
INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING 
Landon waits by Jamie's locker.       The BELL RINGS.   No Jamie. 
INT. CAFETERIA - NOON 
Landon walks along the lunch line, looking.        No Jamie. 
INT. LIBRARY - LATER 
Many many books. Landon cruises the stacks. No Jamie. Belinda, sitting at a table with a girlfriend, sees Landon and turns away. He doesn't pursue it. 
EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - DUSK 
Eric and Clay watch Landon hammer out dents in the Camaro. They're smoking, sharing some beers. Josh, the neighbor kid, stands across the street, wanting to be invited over. 
ERIC (contemptuous) She's like some Puritan. 
LANDON She's not.    She's got her own ideas. 
CLAY Mutant ideas. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON Maybe to you. 
Eric and Clay exchange a look -- is Landon defending her? 
ERIC Belinda's telling everyone that kiss was real. 
LANDON It was. 
Eric and Clay smirk in disbelief. 
ERIC And that you're scamming on Jamie Sullivan. 
LANDON (not denying it) Scamming's a strong word. 
INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - CORRIDOR - NEXT MORNING 
Landon's waiting when Jamie approaches her locker. Her hair pulled back. She looks good in a simple, fresh way. 
LANDON You weren't in school yesterday. 
JAMIE I went to the doctor with my father. 
LANDON He okay? 
JAMIE Healthy as can be. 
Pause. She doesn't help him.          She opens her locker, gets what she needs. 
LANDON You were great the other night. 
JAMIE Thank you.   So were you. 
Pause.   He tries to touch her hair.       She ducks. 
LANDON I haven't been nice to you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE You're hardly nice to anyone. 
LANDON (sincere) I'm sorry. 
JAMIE (walking away) I wish I could believe you. 
INT. CAFETERIA - LATER 
Jamie sits alone, reading, wearing her old brown sweater. Landon walks by Clay and Eric at a table. 
ERIC Landon! 
LANDON Later. 
Puts his tray down on Jamie's table and sits.      Making a public statement. 
JAMIE People can see. 
LANDON And that would ruin your reputation how? 
She goes back to her book.    Ignoring him. 
LANDON (re: her book) What's that? 
She doesn't look up.    Shows him the spine:     The Scarlet Letter. 
JAMIE I'm reading all the novels on Mr. Rothberg's best American authors list. 
LANDON (honest) I don't know that I am -- a man. Yet. I'm working on it. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Pause. 
HAROLD I've worked on it my whole life. 
Harold reaches under his pillow.         Pulls out a small bottle of liquor. Tops off his cider. 
HAROLD Get yourself a glass. 
LANDON No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home. 
Harold nods, liking Landon. 
HAROLD You'll sit a while. 
LANDON I will. 
EXT. RURAL ROADS - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Landon speeds, the windows open, WIND WHIPPING, DIRE STRAITS BLASTING. The Camaro turns and brakes and turns again, kicking up gravel, raising hell. The car slides to a stop. 
INT. CAMARO 
Landon turns OFF the RADIO. Sits still. Wipes the rearview mirror clean, spotless. Unties the dangling plastic skeleton and pockets it. 
EXT. USED CAR LOT - NEXT MORNING 
Colorful banners and flags flap in the brisk WIND.        Landon talks with a used car SALESMAN. 
SALESMAN Eight hundred. 
LANDON It's got a new V-6 and transmission. Alloy wheels. (beat) Twelve hundred. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SALESMAN Nine-fifty. 
LANDON New paint. Extra chrome.     Not a scratch anywhere. 
SALESMAN The interior is -- 
LANDON Reconditioned. Completely. Be a collector's someday. Twelve hundred. 
They look at the Camaro.    Shining in the sun. 
SALESMAN You can't expect me to pay you for your -- attachment to that car. 
Landon gazes at another dealership across the street, then adopts the surly, vaguely-threatening attitude of old. 
LANDON I don't. I expect you to pay me for yours. 
The Salesman looks from Landon to the car. He pulls a wad of cash from his pocket. Wearily counts out twelve bills. Landon takes the money, touches the Camaro's hood, then walks away. 
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - FRONT LAWN - NEXT MORNING 
The marquee reads, "HAPPY HOLIDAYS!" 
EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - SAME TIME 
One car. An old station wagon.        At the parking space, a sign: "School Principal Only." 
INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE 
Kelly looks up from paperwork. 
MR. KELLY Landon? 
Landon drops a folded wad of hundreds on the desk. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON For Jefferson High. For books. 
MR. KELLY (suspicious) Where did you get -- ? 
LANDON (angry) It's mine to give. I didn't steal it. 
MR. KELLY I didn't say you did. 
But his tone implied it and Landon's already gone. Kelly is immediately sorry. He goes to his window and sees Landon pedal away on the old bike. 
EXT. CARTER DRIVEWAY - NEXT DAY 
Landon watches a tow truck lower the abandoned Yugo. When the car is down, he sees Jamie standing on the sidewalk. 
EXT. FOOT OF DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Landon faces Jamie. 
LANDON Hey. 
JAMIE I heard what you did.   Thank you. 
He nods, but quickly changes the subject. 
LANDON (re: the Yugo) She great or what? 
LANDON (incredulous) You came here to give me my report card? 
MR. KELLY I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college. 
Landon understands what Kelly is implying. 
MR. KELLY I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation. 
LANDON Thank you. 
MR. KELLY You're welcome. 
They shake hands. 
INT. LANDON'S BATHROOM - NEW YEAR'S EVE 
Landon, dressed with care, faces the mirror and wet combs his hair. 
INT. FLAUVIN'S - HOUR LATER 
A seafood joint on the waterfront. Quaint, not fancy. Twinkle lights illuminate Jamie's face. Landon finds her lovely. Jamie picks. 
JAMIE I can't believe you asked my father's permission. 
LANDON I wanted this to be a date. 
She watches Landon, happy, then perplexed. 
JAMIE'S POV 
Landon wolfing down his food. 
BACK TO SCENE 
JAMIE Is there a rush? 
LANDON I have to get you home by one. 
JAMIE It's only 7:30. 
LANDON We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father. 
INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT 
Landon drives. The CARS' "Tonight She Comes" PLAYS.   He belches loudly, dramatically. 
JAMIE Excuse you. 
LANDON Your turn. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE (laughing) No. 
LANDON I know you want to. 
She grins.    And tries.   A small burp. 
LANDON Bring the air all the way up from your stomach. 
He belches again.    Just as loud.   She tries again, laughing. 
EXT. YUGO 
Landon steers the car into a parking lot for a miniature golf course with a castle-shaped video arcade and Little League diamond. A family entertainment center. 
INT. YUGO 
Jamie sees where they are. 
LANDON Before we do this. 
JAMIE We're doing something -- ? 
LANDON Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list. 
She waits for more. 
LANDON It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously. 
JAMIE What are you talking about? 
LANDON That little bit of larceny in your heart. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE Excuse me? 
LANDON Fun. 
INT. BATTING CAGE - NIGHT 
Jamie's in the cage with a helmet on.    A machine tosses balls. Landon coaches from outside. 
LANDON Swing! Keep your bat parallel to the ground. Follow through. Follow through! 
Jamie is laughing too hard to hit anything. The balls keep coming. She ducks out of the way and grasps the fence and leans in. Landon leans in on his side. They'd be embracing if the fence weren't there. 
In the b.g., kids from their school.    Giggling, whispering. 
Landon looks over at them. 
LANDON (gently) Now's when you say something. 
JAMIE (overwhelmed) I can't. (beat) I can't -- explain. 
She turns back to him, her eyes shining.     She touches his face and they kiss again, deeply. 
But after a few moments, she drops her chin onto his shoulder. Smiling, glowing even, but slightly aloof, staring at the water. He pulls away slightly to study her face. He touches her cheek and brings her back from wherever she's been. 
JAMIE You make me feel... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON (hopeful) Loved? 
JAMIE (smiling) That.    And less strange. 
Tears run down her cheeks. Landon wipes them away with his thumbs, attributing them to happiness. 
EXT. PARSONAGE - FRONT PORCH - LATER 
Landon follows Jamie up the steps. The lights in the living room are on. THROUGH the windows, they can see her father taking down the Christmas tree. 
JAMIE Be very quiet. 
He pulls her to him.      Kisses her.     The front door opens. 
REV. SULLIVAN (embarrassed) Hello, Landon. 
Landon and Jamie separate, but Landon keeps an arm over her shoulder. 
LANDON Hey, Reverend. 
Reverend Sullivan studies the two young people. 
LANDON (whispers to Jamie) Happy New Year. 
And he goes. Jamie walks by her father and into the house. Not saying anything. He watches her. What has he allowed? 
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY 
Landon and Jamie head into school.        Landon nods to Belinda, others. They glare back. 
LANDON (to Belinda and others) What's your damage? 
INT. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 
Landon and Jamie arrive at his locker.    It's been kicked in. 
LANDON Assholes.     This happen to you? 
JAMIE Twice a year. 
Bang, bang, bang. Landon kicks in every locker in his row. A dozen in all. Jamie watches, a little frightened by his anger. But then he turns to her and grins. 
LANDON Now they all match. 
INT. CAFETERIA - NOON 
Landon eats alone, ignored by Eric and Clay. Jamie approaches with her tray, red-faced, tearful. 
She hesitates about sitting -- feeling bad that Landon's being diminished, ostracized. She thinks he doesn't see her. But as she turns to leave, he pulls a chair out for her and smiles. She sits. Landon sees her face. 
LANDON What's wr--? 
JAMIE (choked up) The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement. 
The PUBLIC ADDRESS SYSTEM CRACKLES.    Landon takes Jamie's hand as the room hushes. 
LANDON Come on. 
JAMIE Where? 
LANDON Away from here. 
EXT. FIRE TOWER (CONSERVATION LAND) - STAIRS - HOUR LATER 
Landon leads Jamie up, round and round, to the top of the tall steel tower. 
EXT. TOP OF TOWER - VIEWING AREA 
They exit the staircase to a small 360 degree overlook. Jamie's amazed at the view. 
JAMIE How do you know this place? 
LANDON Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job. 
They look off to the curve of the horizon, where sea meets sky. 
LANDON From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat. (beat) On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds. 
JAMIE What would you do up here? 
LANDON Look.   Talk.   Not talk. 
He pulls a deck of cards from his jacket pocket. They sit and he starts to shuffle. Not too well. Jamie takes the deck. Shuffles like a card shark. 
EXT. CEMETERY - REAR GATE - NIGHT (FEW DAYS LATER) 
Jamie is already waiting when Landon's Yugo pulls up.       He gets out, walks to her, they kiss. 
LANDON What'd you tell your father? 
JAMIE The truth.   I just left you out of it. 
He draws her close, they kiss. She shyly pulls away. Their hands still touching until she looks again into the telescope eyepiece. 
JAMIE The second best thing is Jupiter. 
She swivels the telescope into position for Jupiter and steps aside so he can look. But he picks up the flashlight, pulls a diagram from his pocket. 
LANDON Can you locate XXI5639I? 
JAMIE Sure. 
She takes the diagram, studies it, and adjusts the scope. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE Here.   Why am I looking at this star? 
LANDON Because I had it named for you.     I know it's not an official designation -- 
She couldn't be happier.     She reaches for his hand. 
JAMIE It's wonderful. I love you. 
It's the first time he's heard it. He pulls her into his arms. They kiss. Passionately. She starts to object. 
LANDON (respecting her boundaries) Okay.   I'm stopping. 
And he does.    They snuggle.   Silence, then: 
LANDON What's number one? 
Long pause. 
JAMIE (very shy) In April when the dogwoods and wisteria are blooming... Get married. 
He doesn't make fun.     He strokes her hair.    Kisses her forehead. 
INT. KITCHEN - 5 AM 
Landon enters from outside. Cynthia, still in her waitress uniform, is sitting at the table, drinking coffee. 
CYNTHIA A late night or an early morning? 
LANDON (honest) Late night. (smart-aleck) You? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CYNTHIA Were you with Jamie? 
LANDON Yeah. 
CYNTHIA You sleeping with her? 
Landon doesn't dignify this question with an answer. 
CYNTHIA I was cleaning yesterday.   I found this. 
She pulls Landon's Life List from her pocket.      Landon is horrified. She reads it. 
CYNTHIA Scuba dive. Touch a moon rock. Learn to read Egyptian hieroglyphs. Go to college? (pause) She talking to you 'bout this stuff? 
Landon doesn't answer. She puts the list on the table. Smoothes it. Gently discouraging. 
CYNTHIA Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities. 
LANDON I could take after Dad, too. 
CYNTHIA You do. You're handsome and charming. 
LANDON I meant he's a doctor. 
CYNTHIA That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being. 
LANDON I could do it if I tried.   Even Kelly thinks so. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CYNTHIA That'd be something. 
She doesn't want to discourage him, but she wants him to be practical and realistic. 
CYNTHIA But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment -- 
LANDON (angry now) Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed -- 
CYNTHIA (honest) Disappointment isn't something anyone plans for. (quieter) It catches you by surprise. 
Long pause.    They are both sorry to have raised their voices. 
CYNTHIA Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ? 
LANDON Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me. 
INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN DINING ROOM - EVENING 
Landon eats dinner with Jamie and Reverend Sullivan. Silence, then: 
REV. SULLIVAN Landon.   You're not the quiet type. 
LANDON No. 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power. 
LANDON That what you do? 
JAMIE Yes.   I try to keep my power. 
He's impressed with how she manages. 
LANDON One of your secrets. 
JAMIE (serious) Yes, one of many. 
He doesn't notice her tone. 
INT. YUGO - TRAVELING - NIGHT 
WHITNEY HOUSTON's "How Will I Know?" ON the RADIO. Jamie flips the RADIO OFF. She's got something on her mind. Landon notices only that she seems a bit remote. 
LANDON You're worried about your college applications. 
JAMIE I'm not applying to college. 
LANDON (stunned) But you said -- 
JAMIE No, you assumed. 
He looks at her, questioning.       She's looking out her window. 
LANDON You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ? 
JAMIE No. 
LANDON What are you going to -- ? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE Pull over. 
LANDON Where?   Why? 
JAMIE Pull over.   Now. Please. 
Tears are running down her face.        He pulls the car over. 
EXT. WOODS BY SIDE OF ROAD - MOMENTS LATER 
Jamie gets out of the car.       Landon quickly follows. 
LANDON Jamie -- 
JAMIE I'm sick. 
LANDON Then I'll take you home.      You'll feel better tomorrow. 
He tries to take her arm. She shakes off his hand, steps back. Wanting to be heard and understood. 
JAMIE Landon. I'm sick -- with leukemia. 
Landon tries to say something.         Nothing comes out.   His soul numb. 
JAMIE I found out last winter. I'm not responding to treatment anymore. 
His face crumples with pain and anguish. 
LANDON Why didn't you tell me? 
JAMIE The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible. (pause) I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me. 
LANDON Including me?! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JAMIE Especially you. (long beat) God gives me an illness, then you. A cruel joke. 
She gets in the car. Slams her door shut.       He stands there, not knowing what to do. 
EXT. YUGO - TRAVELING - LATER 
Landon pulls up in front of Jamie's house.      A long quiet ride. 
LANDON I'm not letting you die. 
Jamie just looks at him.    Feeling sorry for him -- what he wants doesn't matter. 
INT. SULLIVAN KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT 
The Reverend and Landon drink coffee. 
REV. SULLIVAN It's her decision and she's decided not to tell people -- at least for now. 
LANDON How -- how long does she have? 
REV. SULLIVAN Two, three months. Maybe less. Maybe more. 
LANDON So you've given up. 
Reverend Sullivan hears the challenge in his voice. 
REV. SULLIVAN Her doctors have. Jamie and I. We're still praying for a miracle. 
INT. JAMIE'S BEDROOM 
Jamie looks out the window. 
JAMIE'S POV 
Landon pacing, talking to himself. 
BACK TO SCENE 
She starts to raise the window, to say something, to help him, but then lets the curtain drop. She needs for him to decide, for him to be ready to face this with her. 
The sound of a CAR.   She looks out the window again. 
JAMIE'S POV 
The Yugo driving away. 
INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT DAY 
Landon lies on his bed in the dark. The PHONE RINGS. Landon stares at his extension. The RINGING STOPS. A voice from downstairs. 
CYNTHIA (O.S.) It's your father. 
Landon picks up his phone. 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - TWO MINUTES LATER 
The door to Landon's room is ajar. Cynthia waits outside. Listening. Hearing nothing. She pushes the door open. 
CYNTHIA'S POV 
Landon sitting on his bed.   Deflated. 
LANDON He can't do anything. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Cynthia is pained to see his suffering. 
CYNTHIA If it's incurable -- 
LANDON I told him to leave me alone. 
CYNTHIA Landon -- 
LANDON (re: Jamie) It was the only thing I've ever asked him! 
INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - EVENING (NEXT DAY) 
Landon's still in bed. Facing the wall.     Cynthia KNOCKS. Enters with a plate of food. 
CYNTHIA I brought some dinner. 
No response.   She leaves the tray and goes. 
INT. PARSONAGE - SULLIVAN KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
Jamie and her father eat dinner.   Jamie is red-eyed, heartbroken. 
JAMIE (not sure at all) He'll call. 
REV. SULLIVAN I wanted to think he'd changed. 
JAMIE (angry) No you didn't. (beat) But he did change. Just not enough. 
REV. SULLIVAN Jamie, you're not mad at me. You're mad at Landon -- 
JAMIE (furious) I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God! (quieter) I don't even know where to put all my anger. 
REV. SULLIVAN That's normal. God accepts your anger. He won't punish you. 
JAMIE By making me ill, he is punishing me! (quieter) I just don't know what for. 
She flees the room. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Goes up the stairs.    Keeps going.   Up another flight to the attic. 
INT. PARSONAGE ATTIC - MINUTE LATER 
Jamie opens a closet door. Pulls out a dress, a scarf, jewelry, a worn book -- her mother's belongings. She opens the book and starts to weep. Missing her mother. 
FOOT OF ATTIC STAIRS 
Reverend Sullivan stands, looking up at the attic stairs. Frustrated, angry, worried. 
INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - NEXT DAY 
Landon is still in bed. Cynthia enters.      Pulls back the curtains. Yanks up the shades. 
CYNTHIA I don't care if you don't leave the house. But you have to get out of bed. 
INT. CARTER KITCHEN - FEW MINUTES LATER 
Landon sits at the kitchen table.     Cynthia pours him a cup of coffee. 
CYNTHIA You and I may not be communicating very well right now. But let me be clear. Don't make this about you. It's about her. 
Pause.   Her words sink in. 
LANDON I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing? 
CYNTHIA (gently) Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing. (beat) Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs. 
LANDON There.   You gave me a chocolate. 
LANDON'S POV (THROUGH JAMIE'S TELESCOPE) - VAST STAR FIELD 
PULL BACK to reveal... 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Jamie and Landon are looking at stars.      A long quiet moment. 
LANDON What are you thinking? 
JAMIE (honest) That I want you to take me home. 
LANDON Now?    We just -- 
JAMIE I don't want to come here anymore. 
She begins taking the telescope apart.      Depressed. 
EXT. CEMETERY GATE - HALF HOUR LATER 
Jamie looks at the high fence, weary, then reaches into a pocket for a key. Unlocks the gate. Swings the gate open. Landon's astonished. 
LANDON You have a key? 
JAMIE Yeah.  I've just never needed it. (pause) Will you talk to my father? 
LANDON I've talked to your father. 
JAMIE That's what I mean. 
Their eyes meet.     Her look is serious. 
EXT. PARSONAGE - BACK YARD - NEXT DAY 
Reverend Sullivan is up a ladder. Cleaning a gutter. Landon stands below, a few feet away, gathering his nerve. He walks over. 
ON LADDER 
The Reverend is busy ignoring Landon standing below.       A long beat, then: 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON (calling up) Sir. Being ignored is beginning to feel preferable to being noticed. 
The Reverend looks down. 
LANDON I'll be honest. I don't know if I can pray, but I can do just about anything else. 
Neither Landon nor the Reverend see Jamie come out of the house and walk over. 
ON GROUND 
Landon shields his eyes with a hand to see the Reverend better. 
LANDON Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here. (beat) I could start by driving her to school -- 
JAMIE I'm not going back to school. 
Landon and her father both turn to her.      Pale, wane.   They understand what she is saying. 
JAMIE You can tell anyone you want.   I don't care. 
She goes into the house. Landon and Reverend Sullivan look at each other, then away, uncomfortable. That didn't sound like her. 
INT. BEAUFORT HIGH - HALLWAY - MONDAY MORNING 
Landon, looking haggard, moves slowly as he cleans out Jamie's locker. 
Students stare as he carefully places her things, including the pink sweater, in a shopping bag. They part and hush as he passes by. News travels fast. Clay and Eric step forward. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CLAY Hey.   Landon. 
ERIC We heard 'bout Jamie Sullivan. She -- 
LANDON (fierce) Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her. 
ERIC (misunderstood, genuine) No.    Hey. We're sorry, man! 
Landon turns back. Surprised.        Inspects Belinda.   Eric. Clay. Others. No one speaks. 
LANDON Too late and not enough. 
He pushes past Belinda's new boyfriend, heading for the office. 
INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Mr. Kelly and Landon. 
LANDON I know it means not graduating, but I need to be excused from all school acti-- 
MR. KELLY You're excused. 
Landon heads for the door. 
MR. KELLY How is she? 
Landon can't answer.       Too emotional. 
LANDON You okay? 
She nods. Sleepy. Closes her eyes again. He rests his head on her shoulder and weeps. Her eyes open, then close again. There's nothing to say. 
INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE JAMIE'S ROOM - SAME TIME 
Reverend Sullivan looks through the window in the door at the scene within. He hesitates, then pushes the door open. 
INT. PATIENT ROOM 
Reverend Sullivan enters. 
REV. SULLIVAN Landon.   You go on home. 
LANDON I'm not tired. 
REV. SULLIVAN I need to be with her. 
There's only one chair.    Landon nods and goes. 
The Reverend sits, closes his eyes a moment.   When he opens them, she's looking at him. 
JAMIE Dad. 
He kisses her forehead, then sits back. 
JAMIE So serious. 
REV. SULLIVAN Jamie, God is not punishing you. No God I know wants anyone to be sick or feel pain or suffer. 
Pause. 
JAMIE When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more -- 
REV. SULLIVAN I was wrong. Nobody could have wanted or loved your mother more than we did. Not even God. 
He lets this sink in. 
REV. SULLIVAN God loaned you to me, entrusted you to my care. I'm failing you. 
She looks away, agreeing without saying so. 
REV. SULLIVAN Jamie. I make you the same promise that God does. (beat) I will always be with you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She sits up and embraces him. He wraps his arms around her. Tight. She closes her eyes, tears welling, never wanting to let him go. Her father. 
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH SCHOOL - HOUR LATER 
On the marquee on the front lawn: "WELCOME HALEY'S COMET." The Yugo parks in the b.g. 
INT. PRINCIPAL KELLY'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER 
Landon picks up a pile of books and assignments. Looks through them, then eyes Miss Tarbox. 
LANDON Where's Jamie's book?! 
MISS TARBOX That's everything Mr. Kelly gave me. 
LANDON (insistent) The next book on that list!   The Old Man and... and... 
MISS TARBOX The Sea. 
LANDON Yeah.   I need it today! 
Mr. Kelly steps out of his inner office.      Sees Landon's anguished face, his exhaustion. 
MR. KELLY I'll drive a copy over to her. 
Landon nods his appreciation. 
INT. HOSPITAL - PATIENT ROOM - DAY 
Jamie looks smaller. Her eyes have blue circles beneath. The Hemingway novel on the bedstand. Belinda pushes the door open. Peeks in. Not sure she is welcome. 
Landon is sitting in a chair.     He sees her, motions for her to come in. Quietly. 
BELINDA She asleep? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON I'll tell her you were here. 
Pause.   Awkwardness. 
BELINDA Give her this, okay? 
She hands Landon a small photo album. 
BELINDA Pictures from the play.   Jamie looks pretty -- 
LANDON I'm sorry about how we -- 
BELINDA (conciliatory) No.    You're with who you should be.    It's like she chose you. 
LANDON (agreeing) And I have no idea why. 
BELINDA I do. 
She hugs him quickly, then leaves.       Landon goes to the window, looks out. 
ISABEL (shy) Hi. 
Isabel comes in. Landon offers her the book. She takes it and keeps going from where Landon left off. Stumbling but reading. Jamie grins. 
JAMIE Who's been working with you? 
Isabel looks shyly at Landon. Jamie shakes her head, amazed. Landon nods to Isabel and she begins reading again. 
EXT. CARTER BACK STEPS - THAT NIGHT 
Landon quietly opens the back door to the kitchen. 
HIS POV 
Cynthia sits at the table with Dr. Carter, his father. 
CYNTHIA Sit with us a minute. 
INT. CARTER KITCHEN 
Landon enters, but doesn't sit. 
LANDON (to his father) What are you doing here? 
CYNTHIA He wants to talk to you. 
LANDON (to his mother) Now it's okay? 
CYNTHIA Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even -- 
DR. CARTER -- even if we're not here for each other anymore. 
Landon is listening. 
DR. CARTER I want to do this. Please let me. 
He holds out a check.   For a lot of money.   Landon takes it. Grateful. 
LANDON (quietly, to both parents) Thank you. 
INT. PARSONAGE - JAMIE'S BEDROOM - DAY 
A smaller Jamie lies in a hospital bed, seemingly asleep. Hooked to an IV. Bottles of pills. Landon dozes in a comfortable chair. A nurse sits in a corner, reading. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Eric and Clay stand in the doorway, not sure what to do. Jamie opens her eyes, smiles. 
JAMIE Don't wake Landon. 
They tiptoe in.    Stand on either side of her bed. 
JAMIE Do I look scary? 
ERIC Not too bad. 
CLAY You all right? 
A dumb question but she handles it well. 
JAMIE (smiling) Things could be better. 
Awkward pause. 
CLAY We thought you'd be asleep -- 
JAMIE (trying to help) I don't know what to say either. 
Clay hands her an envelope. 
JAMIE What is it? 
She pulls out a stack of worn bills. 
CLAY For the book drive.      Landon told us about it -- 
ERIC We told everyone at school. 
Jamie takes their hands, holds them. Thanking them silently. Her eyes shining with tears. 
INT. LANDON'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Landon sits at his desk, sketching the larger telescope, making a few computations. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A library book on Haley's Comet is open.      A stack of similar books by his elbow. 
Cynthia enters wearing her waitressing outfit. 
CYNTHIA What can I do? 
He shrugs.    Tears fill his eyes. 
LANDON Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more. 
CYNTHIA (gently) Landon, honey. There's nothing more. 
LANDON I don't mean about Jamie being sick. I mean about Jamie and me. 
CYNTHIA Be with her when she wants.    Make sure she never feels alone. 
Long pause. 
REV. SULLIVAN When I was seventeen, I was sent up for a year for stealing a car. (beat) Sometimes I still feel that boy inside me and I don't like him. (beat) But I like you. 
The Reverend stands, offers Landon his hand.     Landon takes it. The two men shake. Allies now. 
INT. JAMIE'S ROOM - THAT EVENING 
Jamie opens her eyes. But can barely keep them open. Groggy from pain medication. Landon's standing there. Showered, clean clothes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LANDON We're going out. 
He starts helping the nurse disconnect her IV. 
JAMIE Can I -- go out? 
LANDON You'll be fine for a few minutes. 
Jamie looks at the nurse.    Uncertain.     The nurse nods. 
EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF - NIGHT 
Landon carries Jamie out a large attic window. The finished large telescope is set up. Pointing at the sky. She's in her nightgown, wrapped in a blanket. 
JAMIE (grateful, touching it) It's beautiful... Thank you. 
But she looks at the lights of the house and streets around them. 
JAMIE I don't know what we'll be able to see... Help me stand. 
He checks his watch. 
LANDON Wait a sec. 
As she turns to him, questioning, the neighborhood suddenly darkens as the street lamps and lights in every nearby house are switched off. 
EXT. DOWN STREET 
Neighbors step outside.    Hold up binoculars. 
EXT. BEAUFORT HIGH - PARKING LOT 
Members of the Star Club and other students look through traditional telescopes. 
EXT. PARSONAGE ROOF 
Jamie hugs Landon in gratitude. 
LANDON We have five minutes. 
Jamie, tears streaming, braces herself against Landon and she peers into the telescope eyepiece. She pulls back, wipes her eyes, then looks again. She swings the telescope into the correct position. 
HER POV THROUGH TELESCOPE 
Haley's Comet, its icy nucleus issuing the jets and streamers of gas, dust, and debris that form the comet's hazy head and long tail. 
JAMIE (O.S.) The comet of the century... 
BACK TO SCENE 
She steps back so he can see. He looks quickly, then moves aside so she can keep looking. She's completely engrossed. A long, quiet moment, then: 
LANDON You love me? 
She leans away from the eyepiece and looks at him -- yes. 
LANDON Will you do something for me? 
JAMIE Landon.    I can't even do for myself. 
LANDON But if you could, you would? 
JAMIE Yes. 
His throat tightens with nervousness, with hope, fear, sadness, and love. 
LANDON Will you marry me? 
HER FACE 
Illness, happiness, disbelief. 
EXT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH - EARLY APRIL 
A sea of pink, purple, and white blossoms.    Dogwoods, wisteria, azaleas, and roses blooming. 
INT. SOUTHERN BAPTIST CHURCH 
Bursting with everyone who knows Jamie and Landon -- every kid in their high school, including Eric, Clay, Belinda; teachers, including Ms. Garber; Mr. Kelly; Luis and Isabel and others from Jefferson High; her father's congregation; Cynthia Carter; Dr. Carter's new wife and their two kids; neighbors; hospital staff and home nurses. 
Landon stands with his father by the altar. 
The "WEDDING MARCH" begins... 
The double doors at the back of the church open. Everyone turns to look at the bride. Gasps of joy and sadness. 
LANDON'S POV - JAMIE 
Flanked by a nurse and Reverend Sullivan. She's wearing her Lizzie dress from the play. It hangs loosely, but still becomes her. She's a beautiful bride. 
BACK TO SCENE

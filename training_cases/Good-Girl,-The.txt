JUSTINE Bubba, stand up. 
BUBBA Why? 
JUSTINE For Christ's sakes. Look at that couch, Phil. Y'all got paint all over it. This ain't gonna come off. Damn it, Phil. 
TV REPORTER ...including this gorgeous eggplant... 
PHIL I think we got most of it out. 
JUSTINE You two were stoned. You, keep frying your brain liike that, you'll slip off a ladder and crack open your head bone. You do really stupid things when you're high, Phil. 
PHIL Like what? 
JUSTINE Like sitting on my couch with your big blue ass. Everything just turns to shit. You finally get nice things, then everything just gets messed up. Why is this TV buzzing? 
PHIL It's the wind doing that. They the wind's coming in different lately. 
JUSTINE Different from what? 
JUSTINE What you reading? 
HOLDEN Catcher in the RyeÂ’ I'm named after it. 
JUSTINE What's your name? Catcher? 
HOLDEN Holden. After Holden Caulfield. He's the main character. 
JUSTINE What's he do? 
JUSTINE He didn't say. 
PHIL You could make paint where, at different angles, the house is different colours. You stand at the front door and the house is red. You stand at the street and the house is green. Or you could make, like, an invisible paint. Make the whole house disappear. 
BUBBA What would be really neat is a paint that could change the molecular structure of a house, like a chemical acid deal. 
PHIL What do you think, Teeny? 
JUSTINE I think you two are a pair of potheads. 
CHERYL You getting a whole one of these or a half? 
CUSTOMER That oneright there.

JUSTINE Yeah, sure okay. 
HOLDEN Alright I'll talk to you about it later. 
GWEN All I know is, everyone should have one beau, before anyone has two beaus. 
JUSTINE He's not my beau, he's my friend. 
CHERYL Happy Halloween Retail Rodeo shoppers! There's a Retail Rodeo special on all bulk candy on aisle four. Ghouls and goblins, witches and warlocks, wandering these aisles, day after day. I'll put a Halloween curse on you. 
GWEN Night Corny. Happy Halloween. 
CORNY Well I'm not a pagen but thanks all the same. 
GWEN Which ankle did you twist, Holden? 
HOLDEN My, uh, left. 
GWEN Maybe you should put some cold water on it so it doesn't sweel up and inflame. 
HOLDEN Okay. 
JUSTINE You're a writer so you have yourself a goal. I used to lie in bed and imagine other cities, other jobs I could have. Other husbands. Now I don't even know what to imagine anymore. Holden, I have a husband. 
HOLDEN You said he was a pig. 
JUSTINE Well, Holden. I don't want to hurt anybody.

HOLDEN Oh god, thank god. 
JUSTINE Where are we goin'? 
JUSTINE That's Bubba's truck. Get in the car. Phil takes that truck to work everyday. Bubba picks him up, and drops him off. Why, why would that truck be parked there? 
HOLDEN I don't know. 
JUSTINE If he finds out about us.... 
HOLDEN I won't let him hurt you. 
JUSTINE He's big, Holden. He'll kill you. He'll beat me, but he'll kill you. 
HOLDEN You can't worry about somethin' that hasn't even happened yet. 
JUSTINE I gotta go to the hospital. 
HOLDEN Okay. (leans in to kiss her; she pulls away) 
JUSTINE Don't! I mean he could be followin' us. 
CORNY Justine! Poor lady. She just passed. 
JUSTINE Who? 
CORNY Gwen! She just passed away. 
JUSTINE What do you mean? I thought she had a stomach ache? 
CORNY It got worse. She was on life support all day. 
JUSTINE I don't understand. 
(Justine and Holden are running towards the car and get in) 
(Next scene they're in the car; back seats, kissing) 
JUSTINE What are we doin'? 
HOLDEN Makin' one out of two. 
JUSTINE (sighs) I haven't thought this through. 
HOLDEN Justine, will you leave him? 
JUSTINE And go where? 
HOLDEN Away. With you on my arm, my folks'll think I've changed. They'll stop thinkin' I'm suck a loner, I got a girlfriend, a pretty one, who knows me and likes me. And they'll be so happy, they'll give me money to write my novel. 
JUSTINE But where will we GO? 
HOLDEN We'll be like... Catcher in the Rye. Only by me. I'll be immortal and then like JD Salinger I'll just vanish. 
PHIL Hey, Teeny. We've been up to no good. We got the day off on account of the rain. 
JUSTINE I thought you might. 
(TV sounds) 
BUBBA So I heard about your friend bein' dead, and all. I'm sorry. 
JUSTINE Yeah. She was real healthy too. 
HOLDEN Well, let's go in the store room. 
JUSTINE Just be patient, Holden! 
(Holden looks freaky; sort of like he's losing his mind not being able to be close to her) 
JUSTINE I was wonderin', when was that, uh, bible study? 
CORNY Tomorrow night at eight. We'd love to have ya. 
JUSTINE Can I bring my husband? 
CORNY 'Course! A couple that prays together stays together. 
PHIL What's this? 
JUSTINE The Holy Bible. There's one for you, and one for me. 
PHIL Not very light is it? 
JUSTINE We're goin' to Bible study. A couple that prays together, stays together. 
PHIL I heard it was the couple that lays together stays together. 
JUSTINE Well you heard wrong. 
JUSTINE Cheryl? You think you can take this one? 
CHERYL Sure... Sit right down here ma'am, we're gonna make you pretty. Now how do you like your hair? 
JUSTINE He left. 
PHIL Well, I'm ready. Let's go. 
PHIL I don't know what to say about Jesus. I'm stoned. 
JUSTINE Just let the other people do the talking. 
PHIL Jeez. We forgot the Bibles, Justine. 
JUSTINE Well, that's alright, they'll forgive us. 
CORNY Hi. Welcome. Hey there people! Glad you could make it! 
JUSTINE Hi Corny. This is my husband, Phil. 
CORNY Y'all are in for a treat. We got a good discussion going tonight. If man is made in God's image, what does that say about God? 
PHIL Yeah, that sounds like a good one. 
(Justine recognizes one of the people. It's the guy who works at the motel where she and Holden have been going to.) 
JUSTINE Phil, come with me to the car. 
PHIL What? 
JUSTINE Come with me to the car, I gotta get somethin'. 
PHIL What's goin' on? 
CUSTOMER I think I look kinda wierd. 
CHERYL Well, the first rule of fashion is that you have to look wierd. What I'm doing here has come straight from France. 
CUSTOMER Oh. 
CHERYL It's called circ du face, meaning circus of the face and it's all the rage with the Frenchies. 
CUSTOMER Well, you're the professoinal. 
CHERYL That's right. 
CORNY Justine, what happened to you? I looked up and I saw you two drivin' off like vampires in the night. 
JUSTINE Oh geez, we forgot our Bibles. 
CORNY You coulda looked off your neighbor. It's a church, you know. You can't make water without bumpin' your nut on a bible. 
JUSTINE Oh. Well, we felt bad. 
CORNY (looks at the customer) What in blazes?! 
CUSTOMER Do you like it? 
JUSTINE I can't go. 
HOLDEN What? 
JUSTINE I can't go today. There's something important I need to tend to. 
JUSTINE Thanks. 
(Justine arrives at Bubba's. He opens the door and his dog, Bitz, is barking.) 
BUBBA Easy Bitz, easy Bitz. Back in your corner! Back in your corner! Back in your corner, Bitz! Come on in. I wanna show you somethin'. Sit. (Yells at dog again) I'm in shock. 
JUSTINE Why? 
BUBBA You know why. 
JUSTINE Bubba sat like that for what seemed like ten years before he began to speak. Finally, when he opened his mouth, he talked a blue streak about the ruin that was his life. He talked about how he loved Phil, and how he loved me. And how he always wanted a girlfriend just like me, and to be a guy like Phil, to this imaginary girl like me, that he never found. Then he wen on about givin' up your dreams and how it's all a part of gettin' older. Bubba had given up on his dream to be like Phil, and accepted his fate as Bubba, always and forever. Then, last week, a door that remained shut swung wide open. Bubba thought this no chance coincidence, a cosmic force was at work. The sounds of me makin' love to a man that wasn't Phil was like a shout in Bubba's ear from the creator himself. What it meant, or what to do, or why Bubba didn't know. All he knew was that he hated me for poisoning the well of idealism that he had drunk from for so long. I was no longer Bubba's image of perfection. To him I was just a liar, and a whore, and that sickened him. But on the other hand he loved me for opening his eyes and releasing him from the bitter chains of evny that bound him to Phil. Phil was no superman, just a cuckhold, and a foll, and that was beautiful. Bubba felt that there was just one thing left for us to do. Something that would solve both our problems and end this whole tragic cycle. 
JUSTINE Bubba, I am not gonna sleep with you. 
BUBBA But don't you see? This is my chance, for liberation. 
JUSTINE But, one person's liberation is another person's, well, badness. There's just no way. 
BUBBA I'm gonna have to tell Phil then. 
JUSTINE Why? 
BUBBA He's my best friend. I can't keep him in the dark about somethin' this big. He's a cuckhold. 
JUSTINE You wanna cuckhold him yourself! 
BUBBA Well that's different. That isn't about him. That's about my salvation. Look, you've got your choice to make. Either destroy your marriage, and break your husband's heart. Or have sex with me right now. 
(Bubba is yelling at the dog again, and saying Justine's name) 
PHIL You didn't even say nothing about the TV bein' fixed. 
JUSTINE Oh. Is it? Thanks. 
PHIL You're welcome. 
JACK Well aren't you a fright? Justine, you talked to Holden lately? He didn't show up for work today, I wanna know what gives. I know you two are friends. 
JUSTINE We're not friends. 
JACK You eat lunch together every day. 
JUSTINE No, we don't. 
JACK Well, if you see him, tell him Jack Fields is lookin' for him. 
(Justine gets in the car and is shocked when she sees Holden in the car, more depressed than ever.) 
JUSTINE Oh my god. What are you doin'? 
HOLDEN You're a hooker, you hooker. 
JUSTINE I saw you. You followed me. 
HOLDEN So, how many guys you gettin' with? You gettin' with every guy in the state? 
JUSTINE No, Holden, this is all because of you. He had me over a barrel. If I didn't sleep with him he was gonna tell Phil about us! 
HOLDEN I'm so alone! 
JUSTINE No, I don't. 
BUBBA I know you're angry and I can figure why. But, from where I stand, what happened yesterday was a wonderful thing. 
JUSTINE Nothin' happened yesterday, so drop it. 
BUBBA Well, I'm awful grateful to ya, Justine. 
JUSTINE Bubba, I mean it. 
BUBBA Let me just ask you one thing. How do I stack up against Phil? You know, how do I stack up where it counts? 
NURSE Ma'am? Your husband asked me to request for your presence. 
(Justine knocks on the door.) 
PHIL Who's there? 
JUSTINE It's Justine. (gets into the room) 
PHIL C'mon. I can't do this on my own. I need help. 
JUSTINE You've never done it on your own? 
PHIL Not in a place like this! Not where I have to hand over the results! Just, let me hold your boob. 
(holds her boob; Justine's face is full of pain) 
JUSTINE Ah, they're sore. (Justine looks fed up with everything) 
JUSTINE It means I'm pregnant. 
PHIL ALRIGHT! 
PHIL I knew it. Waste of time going to that sperm doctor. We did it. We're gonna have ourselves a baby. 
JUSTINE Maybe. 
PHIL And tomorrow, we're gonna celebrate at Senor Tuna. Yes we are. I'm gonna bring Bubba. You can bring some of your friends from work. Or Bible study guy. Whoever. Too bad Gwen's dead. 
JUSTINE The test could be wrong, Phil. It's a little early to be havin' a party. 
PHIL Let's do it mellow then. You sure don't seem too excited. 
JUSTINE No, I'm excited. It's just, a lot of worries come with havin' a baby... 
PHIL Don't think negative. Think positive. We could have ourselves a tiny Phil. Or a tiny Teeny. Teeny's gonna have a tiny weeny Teeny. 
JUSTINE Do you think anything's gonna change havin' a baby? 
PHIL What do you mean? Everything's gonna change. 
JUSTINE Yeah, but I mean, do you think anything's really gonna change? 
PHIL What do ya mean? 
(Holden and his parents sit on the couch and watch TV when the phone rings. Holden gets it.) 
HOLDEN (picks up the phone) Hello? 
CHERYL Holden, Holden did it. Fool left his cashier key in the door. 
JUSTINE Oh my god. 
CHERYL They can't find him though. They say he robbed his folks too. You in on it? 
JUSTINE What?! No! 
CHERYL I know you two played hookie in the store room. I never rat on ya, I've done some things myself. But, still. You in on it? 
JUSTINE I don't know what you're talkin' about. 
CHERYL Suit yourself. 
CORNY Justine. Can we talk to you for a second? 
JACK Hi, Justine. Go ahead and have a seat. 
CORNY Justine, you like workin' at the Retail Rodeo don't you? Like the company, like the people? You wouldn't want to jeopardize that by makin' some silly error in judgement would ya? 
JACK Holden stole fifteen thousand dollars from the safe last night. Did you have anything to do with it? 
JUSTINE No. I don't know anything. 
CORNY 'Cause we know you're pretty tight with Holden. 
JUSTINE I hardly know him. 
CORNY I've seen you in the store room with him Justine. On many the occasion. I think you know him pretty well. 
JUSTINE This is all going too fast. 
HOLDEN Justine, what have you got to lose? 
JUSTINE Nothin'. 
HOLDEN So be there by noon. 
JUSTINE Okay. 
HOLDEN I love you, Justine. This is all gonna work out. I know it. I almost forgot. This is a story of your life. You inspired me. (they kiss and Holden gets out of the car) 
PHIL Hey Teeny! 
JUSTINE Hey. 
PHIL We were gettin' worried about ya! 
JUSTINE Sorry. 
BUBBA Justine, this is Liberta. Liberta, this is Justine. 
JUSTINE Hi. 
LIBERTA Hi. 
BUBBA Congratulations, on your expectation. 
JUSTINE Thanks. 
PHIL Hey. 
JUSTINE Hey. 
PHIL What's going on in the bedroom? Looks like a twister hit it. 
JUSTINE Oh yeah. I was doin' laundry. 
PHIL I thought we were robbed. Why aren't you at work? 
JUSTINE They gave me the day off. 
(TV reporter talking about Holden killing himself at the hotel) 
PHIL Retail Rodeo? You know that guy? 
JUSTINE No. 
JACK Attention Retail Rodeo employees this is JAck Fields, your store manager. As most of you all know by now, We lost another employee yesterday. Holden was a thief and a disturbed young man, and what happened was a sad thing. Perhaps we can learn a lesson from this tragedy, like don't steal and don't be disturbed. The important is to move on. Like dozens of those who quit. This one's for you Holden. 
CHERYL I thought we were gonna get a day off and go to the movies.... 
JUSTINE What? 
BUBBA I was just at your house and the mail came. Phil was opening letters, and he opened this bill from the credit card company. And F&$%. Please don't tell him about us, Justine. Please. Please. I love Phil. I love him more than myself. Please have mercy on me. 
JUSTINE Hey Phil. 
PHIL Have you been sleepin' around behind my back?

FOURTH DRAFT March 7, 1995 
FADE IN: 
A FIST HITS A FACE The fist is in a boxing glove. It belongs to VIC DEAKINS, 38. The face belongs to RAWLEY HALE, 28. They are in... 
INT. GYMNASIUM, WHITEMAN AFB - DAY 
Hale and Deakins are sparring in a ring. Other people are lifting weights, shooting baskets. 
IN THE RING Hale and Deakins circle each other. Hale is shaking cobwebs out of his head. 
DEAKINS You know what happened there? 
HALE Hell, I barely know what day it is. 
DEAKINS I set you up. I fake right, go left three times in a row. You expect it again, I take the right in hard. That's what boxing's all about. Make your opponent think you're gonna do one thing, then do another. Like Ali in Zaire, using the rope-a-dope on Foreman. (mimes rope-a-dope) Everyone thought Ali's arms were getting destroyed, when he was really just letting Foreman tire himself out. Eighth round, Ali starts hitting, George's got nothing left -- fight's over. 
HALE The fact that I can't feel the left side of my face -- that's okay, right? Deakins laughs. Hale seizes the relaxed moment and suddenly launches into Deakins with a flurry of punches. 
THE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE GYM Take notice -- the fight is getting real. They move to the ring. 
DEAKINS Several of Hale's punches land. Deakins staggers back, caught off guard. It looks like he might even go down. 
HALE He cocks his arm back. He could finish Deakins off. But he doesn't. He drops his fist. 
DEAKINS Seizes the opportunity and slugs back. 
THE CROWD Loves it. 
HALE AND DEAKINS Now Deakins has the upperhand. He backs Hale around the ring. 
DEAKINS Don't watch my hands -- watch my shoulders. That's where the punch starts. Ready? Deakins hits Hale hard in the face, sending him back. 
THE SPECTATORS Are circling the ring, following the fighters, cheering. 
HALE AND DEAKINS 
DEAKINS You were looking at my hands. Let's try it again. Ready? Deakins hits Hale hard. He's got Hale on the run. 
DEAKINS Come on. Focus. Ready? 
(PUNCH) My shoulders. Ready? Deakins fakes left, puts everything into one big uppercut. It connects. 
HALE Lands, dazed, blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth. 
DEAKINS He's in silhouette, the lights above him. 
HALE Looks up at Deakins, catches his breath. 
HALE AND DEAKINS Deakins offers his hand. Hale pushes it aside. Deakins ignores Hale, grabs him and helps him to his feet. Deakins climbs out of the ring between the ropes. Hale grabs the top rope and flips himself over, landing on his feet. Deakins gives Hale a look, laughs, shakes his head. 
INT. SHOWERS 
Hale lets the water rinse the blood off his face. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY 
Hale and Deakins are sitting on the bench between their lockers, getting into their flightsuits, pulling on boots. Deakins is smoking a cigarette. The smoke curls up into the light slanting down across the room from high windows. 
HALE'S LOCKER Is in sunlight. On the inside of his locker door are pictures of exotic planes -- the SR-71, a swept-wing fighter, an artist's rendition of the Aurora, etc. 
HALE AND DEAKINS Enter and walk under the plane, nodding to the ground crew. Hale and Deakins are royalty. Deakins and Hale climb up the airplane's Crew Entry steps and disappear. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Hale and Deakins climb into a very strange cockpit. There are two pilots' seats in this plane, with duplicate controls. 
But instead of the usual dials and gauges on the control panels, there are FOUR COMPUTER SCREENS in front of each pilot. Hale gets into the left seat; Deakins the right. They review information on their screens, flip switches. 
INTERCUT WITH BOMBS Being loaded into the bomb bays. When they've been clamped into place in the rotary bomb racks... 
DEAKINS (into helmet mike) Ready for rollout. 
INT./EXT. HANGAR 
Alarm horns sound, wheels roll on track and the huge hangar doors open revealing... 
THE GHOST An enormous black flying wing. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Deakins looks at maps on his computer screens. Hale looks over, sees the map of Utah. 
HALE You know, these exercises are fantastic. I mean, when that day comes and we finally go to war against Utah, we are really going to kick ass. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT 
Bright moonlight shows a campfire burning at the edge of an escarpment, the Colorado River a thousand feet below. Near the campfire is an Army surplus tent. Next to it, an easel holds a painting in progress. 
A PARK RANGER TRUCK Drives up, stops. The driver's door open, and out gets... 
A RANGER We don't see his face in the dark. He switches on a flashlight, walks over and taps on the tent. 
RANGER Park Ranger. I'd like to talk to somebody about this fire. 
We hear a man and a woman -- JIM and WANDA, 60s -- wake up. 
JIM (O.S.) Wha--? Oh, hell. 
WANDA (O.S.) I'll talk to him, Jim. 
JIM (O.S.) Wanda, you stay put. Jim comes out of the tent, the ranger's light in his face. 
JIM I know -- no wood fires in the Park. It's just -- Wanda's got a cold and I wanted her to stay warm. 
RANGER Sir, you see any other hikers, campers anywhere around here? 
JIM Not this time of year. What's the fine for something like this? 
RANGER Your life. Jim grins. But the ranger pulls out a pistol and shoots Jim, who falls into the fire. He then puts three shots through the wall of the tent. Nothing moves. The Ranger -- call him BAKER -- pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on. 
BAKER Done. 
HEADLIGHTS Come on and two Humvees roll in and four men get out. Three of them -- JOHNSON, a tech-whiz; LETT, gangly, grim, and NOVACEK, a wiry guy in a baseball cap -- start setting up what looks to be a high-tech missile launcher. The fourth man is... 
MR. PRITCHETT A neatly groomed man, 40s, with a perpetually sour attitude. He looks like -- and is -- a lawyer. 
PRITCHETT (to Baker, re: Jim in 
FIRE) Jesus. Do you think maybe you could get him out of the fire? Unless you like that smell. 
EXT. THE NIGHT SKY 
The Ghost flies overhead, roaring. 
INT. COCKPIT 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
CU RADAR SCREEN The Ghost's blip disappears. 
WILKINS Lost 'em on active! Who's still got 'em? 
IR CREWMAN Got their heat signature, sir. (points to computer 
SCREEN) Their engines may be cold, but the air is colder. 
CU COMPUTER SCREEN Half of the screen shows a waveform, like a voiceprint. The other half shows a triangle moving across a map of Colorado. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Deakins studies the maps on the computer screens. 
DEAKINS Descend to 400 feet AGL. River valley approach. 
HALE Airspeed lock at point-seven Mach. Blue line descent on throttle to 400 feet AGL. Hale pulls back on the throttle. The plane descends. 
HALE Time to limbo down. How low can we go. 
EXT. NIGHT SKY 
The Ghost drops away from us, a stark black cut-out against the moonlit Colorado landscape. The Colorado River is a winding silver ribbon five miles below. 
EXT. CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, UTAH - NIGHT 
A PARK RANGER TRUCK Driving along the blacktop. The driver is not Baker. It's... 
TERRY CARMICHAEL Pretty, late 20s. Her radio squawks. 
CLYDE (V.0.) Terry? You been through the Needles entrance tonight? 
TERRY (grabs mike, answers) No. Why? 
CLYDE (V.0.) Mrs. Parker called -- 
TERRY Oh, God. What is it this time? UFO abduction? Ritual human sacrifice? 
CLYDE (V.0.) She said she saw a bunch of trucks going through the Needles entrance an hour ago and thought they looked suspicious. 
TERRY Yes, well, this is a woman who chopped off one of her own fingers because it'd "turned on her." 
CLYDE (V.0.) Thing is, she said one of the trucks was ours, and you're the only one out. 
TERRY (arches eyebrow) She was probably hallucinating, but I'll check it out. 
EXT. COLORADO RIVER VALLEY - THIRTY MILES UP RIVER 
We feel the Ghost before we hear it. It rushes over, close to the river, below the ridgelines on either side of the valley. 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
The triangle representing the Ghost disappears from a computer screen. 
IR CREWMAN Lost 'em. 
WILKINS Stay on it. They're gonna have to come up for air sooner or later. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Deakins reads his computer screens. 
DEAKINS We're under the radar. Proceed to primary target. Hale hits a button, lets go of the stick -- they're on autopilot. It's a moment of peace. Hale looks out. 
HALE I tell people I became a pilot because I wanted to fly cool planes. It's also for this. When we're up here, I feel... closer ... I don't know. 
EXT. THE GHOST 
Heads into the beacon light. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Hale and Deakins look at each other as the plane enters the light and the light, in SLOW MOTION, washes across their faces. 
DEAKINS Suddenly lets go of Hale's hand, then hits Hale hard under the chin with the fire extinguisher. 
HALE His head snaps back as Deakins pulls. 
HALE'S EJECTION SEAT HANDLE Pop, hiss like a huge vacuum-sealed can is being opened. 
EXT. ABOVE GHOST 
The ejection hatch blows and is ripped away by the wind. 
HALE'S POV As he rockets up out of the cockpit. 
HALE When the chute opens, he almost spills out because of the severed shoulder harness. He grabs the straps, holds on. 
EXT. ON THE GROUND 
Terry, on the radio with Clyde. 
TERRY Somebody ejected! 
INT. COCKPIT 
Debris -- coffee cups, flight bags, anything not nailed down -- is whipping around the inside of the cabin. Deakins reaches through the maelstrom, then reaches to the ARMAMENT BUTTONS and punches them. 
INT. BOMB BAYS 
The the clamps snap back and the two B-83s drop toward the earth. 
INT. COCKPIT 
Deakins looks around, then gets an idea. He hits the LANDING mission mode button and the cockpit lights up. 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
The Ghost starts popping up on everyone's screens. There's a chorus of "I got em!" and "They're ba-a-a-ck!" Wilkins looks at a screen, puzzled. 
WILKINS They're not due for another halfhour. 
INT. GHOST COCKPIT 
Deakins yells into his helmet mike as he gets ready to eject. 
DEAKINS (into helmet mike) This is Deakins! Hale lost it! I have to punch out! Deakins pulls his second handle. BLAM! WHOOSH! He's gone. He hear and feel the plane dropping, screaming toward the earth. 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
CU RADAR SCREEN The Ghost's blip suddenly disappears from the screen. A chorus of "What the hell?" and "Jesus." 
WILKINS That's not good. 
EXT. MCMURRAN RUNWAY 
Alarm horns blare. FIVE MEN are running to a waiting Blackhawk helicopter. Waving the men on is Wilkins. The last man up is... 
LIEUTENANT COLONEL SAM RHODES 40s, short grey hair: he could snap your neck with a look. Wilkins pats Rhodes on the shoulder and Rhodes jumps into... 
THE HELICOPTER And it lifts up and flies off. 
EXT. CANYONLANDS 
Wilkins talks to Rhodes over the radio. 
WILKINS Watch your needles! 
EXT. GHOST CRASH SITE 
Rhodes walks up to his men who are in the process of opening the bomb bay doors manually. The doors are open a foot. Rhodes signals his men to stop. Rhodes steps up, shines a light into the bomb bays. 
INSIDE BOMB BAYS Rhodes' light plays over the bomb racks -- empty. 
RHODES (into headset mike) Colonel? (takes breath) We've got ourselves a Broken Arrow. 
INT.PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM 
Stunned silence. They've just gotten the news. Baird doesn't know what it means. 
BAIRD Broken Arrow? 
CHAIRMAN That's what we call it when we lose a nuclear weapon. 
BAIRD Oh, Jesus. (thinks, shakes head) I don't know what's scarier -- losing nuclear weapons or the fact that it happens so often that you people have a term for it. 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
Wilkins is on the radio with Rhodes. 
WILKINS Find the nukes, Sam. But be careful. I know they say those eggs can't be cracked, but if your geigers pick up more rads than you'd get off a toaster, I want you out of there. Wilkins to the CORPORAL. 
WILKINS Get the teams in. I want Colonel Rhodes and his men backed up. 
INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM 
CU COMPUTER SCREEN Various views of a B-83 nuclear weapon. Creeley is briefing Baird on the nukes. 
BAIRD They dropped from a plane but they didn't go off...? 
CREELEY They have to be armed to detonate. 
BAIRD Then they're destroyed? 
CREELEY (shakes head) They're designed to survive crashes intact. They can lie in a pool of burning jet fuel for five hours without any problem. 
BAIRD How did this happen? 
CREELEY In his last transmission, Colonel Deakins said Major Hale lost control. He probably hit weapons release by accident. Believe me, when a plane's auguring in, you start pushing every button you can. Baird stands, looks at a picture of a Ghost shakes his head. 
BAIRD Hell, we should take the cost of the plane out of major Hale's salary. Although I guess at two billion dollars a pop, that could take a while. 
EXT. CANYONLANDS - DAWN 
Hale is still unconscious, lying beside his parachute. There's the crunch of footsteps and a FIGURE looms over Hale. The figure reaches down to touch Hale's shoulder and... 
HALE Spins, grabs the shirt of the figure and cocks his arm about to punch. He hesitates when he sees it's... 
TERRY She seizes Hale's hesitation and punches him hard. 
HALE AND TERRY Hale is stunned. Terry starts to get up, reaching for her gun. Hale strikes out with a leg, getting Terry in the gut, sending her back. She hits the ground, still struggling for her gun. Hale gets up, runs, sprinting off over the rocky terrain. 
HIS POV Jarring, racing over rock and then... 
HALE Pulls up fast, almost not fast enough. 
HALE'S POV He's stopped right at the edge of a fifty foot drop. 
TERRY (O.S.) That would be the wrong way. 
TERRY Is walking slowly, calmy, up behind Hale, pistol out. 
EXT. ATOP THE CREVICE 
Lett pitches back, dead. 
PRITCHETT AND DEAKINS Pritchett looks at Deakins -- another part of the plan? Deakins is unperturbed. He's holding an overnight bag. He unzips it. 
EXT. BOTTOM OF THE CREVICE 
Rhodes whispers to Kelly. 
RHODES We'll open up the access panels, put in a couple grenades. The nukes won't go nuclear, but they will go dirty. I won't lie and say we'll be all right. We won't. But if we're gonna go, might as well take those bastards with us. Rhodes scrambles off. 
KELLY Just one thing, sir. 
RHODES 
(TURNS) What? 
KELLY This. Kelly opens fire with his rifle. Rhodes is thrown back, dead. Kelly yells up top. 
KELLY Done! Kelly grabs the rope, climbs fast. 
EXT. ATOP THE CREVICE 
Mr. Pritchett looks at Deakins, surprised. Deakins -- putting on new clothes -- just grins. Deakins takes... 
THE TWENTY DOLLAR BILL From his flightsuit and puts it into his shirt pocket. 
KELLY Climbs into view. 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
Kelly's voice comes in over the speaker. 
KELLY (V.0.) 
(TERRIFIED) Colonel Wilkins? You there? 
WILKINS Who is this? 
KELLY (V.0.) It's Lieutenant Kelly, sir. 
WILKINS What happened, Kelly? 
EXT. ATOP CREVICE 
Kelly talks over the helicopter's radio mike. Deakins is behind him, shaving with an electric shaver. 
KELLY Colonel Rhodes is dead, sir! They're all dead! 
WILKINS (V. 0.) What happened? Deakins puts the shaver to the radio mike. There's a wash of 40 static. Deakins pulls the shaver away, nods to Kelly. 
KELLY It's the nuke, sir! It's open! Wide open! Oh, God, what am I going to do?! Deakins puts the shaver to the mike again -- more static. He reaches into the helicopter and flips off the COM LINK switch, then backs away, shaving. He nods to Novacek, who fires up the helicopter. 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
Wilkins slumps in his chair. 
WILKINS Call back the teams and get me the Room. We're gonna need NEST in here. 
EXT. CREVICE SITE 
Novacek lifts off in the helicopter and flies away. Deakins turns to Kelly and applauds his performance. 
DEAKINS Brought a tear to my eye. 
KELLY I'd just like to thank the members of the Academy. 
INT. NEST HELICOPTER 
SIX very serious-looking SOLDIERS are in black radiation suits, listening to COLONEL HUNT, 45, over headsets. 
HUNT Listen up, sportsfans. Word is, this particular broken arrow has broken open. Our ETA Utah is ninety-six minutes. I want everyone to take that time to triple-check the seams and seals on their E-suits. Let's go! 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL ROOM 
Giles looks at Wilkins. 
GILES You think I'm nuts. You don't think NEST or the satellite will find anything weird. 
WILKINS That's right. 
(BEAT) But it wouldn't hurt to get some gunships fueled just in case. Wilkins reaches for a phone. Giles smiles. 
EXT. HELICOPTER EXPLOSION SITE 
The helicopter wreck burns. Hale looks over the terrain. 
HALE How do they get out of here? 
TERRY Get out? I don't think that helicopter's going anywhere. 
HALE Deak'd have a back-up. He'd be prepared. 
TERRY If they've got trucks they could take the four-wheel-drive trail we were on. 
HALE He wouldn't want to go towards town. 
TERRY He could go to the river. Hale looks at Terry -- that's exactly what Deakins would do. 
EXT. 4WD TRAIL 
The two Humvees roll along the narrow, twisting trail. 
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE Kelly drives, Deakins beside him, Johnson and Pritchett in back. 
DEAKINS You a fan of boxing, Mr. Pritchett? 
PRITCHETT I think it's barbaric. 
DEAKINS Me, too! I love it! Two men trying to do as much damage to the other as he can. As basic as you can get, don't you think? 
PRITCHETT I think it should be banned. 
DEAKINS So do I! God, wouldn't that make it more exciting? Having to go into dark alleys and basements to see a fight? I bet we see eye-to- eye on a lot of things, Mr. Pritchett. Deakins grins; Mr. Pritchett steams. 
EXT. CANYONLANDS 
Hale and Terry stand on an outcropping overlooking the 4WD trail. 
THEIR POV The two Humvees make their way along the trail. 
HALE See the one in front? It just has a driver? They wanted to keep the weight down. It has the nukes. Hale takes Terry's gun from her. 
TERRY You gonna shoot out the tires? 
HALE Humvees can reseal and inflate with the flick of a switch. That's why Deak chose 'em. Terry looks at Hale -- then what is he going to do? 
HALE I'm gonna steal it. (checks gun) You get to a phone and call McMurran. 
TERRY The nearest phone is a two-hour walk. 
HALE Then you better start walking. 
TERRY Look, I know my way around here. You're gonna need me. 
A FLARE Out of the tool kit. 
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE 
KELLY Maybe he'll set off a nuke. That'd show us. 
BETWEEN THE HUMVEES Hale tosses the jerry can of gasoline out the back of the Humvee. 
THE JERRY CAN OF GASOLINE Flies through the air. There's a burning flare taped to the side of the plastic can. 
ECU TIP OF FLARE As the plastic of the can bubbles and melts and... 
IN THE SECOND HUMVEE 
DEAKINS Stop! But it's too late and... 
THE JERRY CAN Explodes. 
THE SECOND HUMVEE Skids to a stop, showered with burning gasoline. Deakins and his men bail out. Kelly, Johnson and Pritchett run for cover. 
DEAKINS Coolly grabs a fire extinguisher and starts spraying. 
IN HALE AND TERRYS HUMVEE Hale climbs up into the front seat. Terry looks at him, genuinely impressed. 
HALE We need somewhere to hide. 
TERRY 
(THINKS) I know a place. 
EXT. 4WD TRAIL 
Deakins keeps spraying the burning Humvee with foam. 
EXT. MINE ENTRANCE 
Terry and Hale have taken the Humvee to the parking area in front of an abandoned mine. The winch on the Humvee strains. The cable is attached to the handles on the padlocked metal doors. The doors are slowly pulling out, groaning. 
TERRY It was a copper mine, barely squeaking along for years. They shut it-down a few months ago when they hit an underground river. The hinges on the metal doors buckle and snap and the doors rip loose. Hale shuts down the winch, unhooks it from the doors. He motions for Terry to drive it in. 
INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE 
Terry drives the Humvee into the mineshaft entrance. Hale uses a flashlight to look around. He finds a switch a flips it. A gas generator comes to life. Another click and lights come on. Now they can see the rest of the entry area, including a wire- mesh-enclosed elevator. As Terry looks around, Hale grabs the Humvee radio, tries to tune in other frequencies, gives up. 
HALE They hardwired in their frequency. We can't call out. 
TERRY What are we gonna do? Hale goes to the back of the Humvee, pulls down the tailgate. 
HALE I'm gonna take away Deakins' reason for being here. Hale grabs a screwdriver from the tool kit and pries open a panel on the side of one of the B-83s. 
INSIDE PANEL There's an LCD DISPLAY, a NUMERIC KEYPAD and a CLOCK showing the current time. The keys are oversized and brightly colored. 
TERRY Fisher-Price makes nuclear weapons? 
HALE They're designed to be used by guys wearing gloves in Alaska. He reaches in, hits a key and the LCD display lights up. 
HALE These nukes have security codes. If you enter the wrong code three times, the nuke goes dead -- all the circuitry shorts out and shuts down. Kind of like the security systems with car radios. 
TERRY And people say the public doesn't benefit from defense spending. 
HALE 
(GRINS) Hand me the radio. Terry goes for the radio mike. Hale sees something. 
A PLASTIC NAME TAG Sticking out from under one of the nukes. 
HALE Pulls it out, looks at it. 
HALE He's got a scanner. He'd find them. 
TERRY You're talking about setting off a nuclear weapon! 
HALE They set them off underground in Nevada all through the fifties and sixties. There's no risk. 
TERRY Tell it to the two-headed cows. Hale grabs the straps around one of the nukes, pulls. He can barely move the thing. He turns to Terry. 
TERRY No! I am not helping you set off a nuclear weapon. 
HALE We won't be down there when it goes off. This isn't a suicide mission. 
TERRY No! 
HALE 
(IMPATIENT) All right. Fine. Though I think you should know, before I ejected, I heard Deakins say the nukes were going to be used to wipe out the last few remaining handicapped gay whales. Terry looks at him -- you asshole. Hale looks at her, very serious. 
HALE I need your help. Terry thinks, shakes her head, steps up and grabs the nuke. 
EXT. 4WD TRAIL 
The Humvee takes the turn-off to the mine entrance. 
INT. MINESHAFT ELEVATOR - DESCENDING 
Hale and Terry are going down with the nukes. 
HALE When we get to the bottom we'll have to get away from this shaft. It'll limit the amount of radiation released into-the atmosphere. 
EXT. MINE ENTRANCE 
Deakins's Humvee comes into the clearing. The Humvee stops and Deakins and Kelly jump out, followed by Pritchett and Johnson. 
EXT. MINE - BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT 
The elevator comes down. Hale slides open the gate. He and Terry drag the nukes out. 
TERRY We'll each drag one down a tunnel? 
HALE No. I'm only going to set off one. We'll leave the other one here. It'll be buried under a billion tons of rock. They are startled when the elevator starts going up behind them 
HALE We better hurry. (nods down tunnel) Let's try down there. 
They start hauling the nuke down the tunnel. 
INT. MINE ENTRANCE 
Deakins, Pritchett, Kelly and Johnson wait by the elevator. 
PRITCHETT I can't wait to see how this fits into your plan. Deakins' charm peels away for an instant and he fixes Pritchett with a stare. Pritchett shrinks back. 
INT. PENTAGON SITUATION ROOM 
Baird, the Chairman and the others are watching large TV monitors. Creeley walks them through what they're looking at. 
ON THE MONITORS A wide-view, bird's-eye, thermal image of rocky terrain. 
CREELEY This is the KH-12 satellite's infrared view of the area. An exposed nuclear core would be relatively hot -- it'd show as a circle of bright white. As you can see, there's nothing. The only heat signatures we found were these. The image changes. There are four blotches, glowing a dull red. 
BAIRD What's --? 
CREELEY We think it's Colonel Rhodes and his men. Their bodies. A look between Baird and the Chairman. The Chairman reaches for a phone. 
INT. MCMURRAN CONTROL CENTER 
Wilkins is on the phone. Giles looks at him. 
HALE AND TERRY Reaches up to grab the big rock, but Johnson sends a spray of bullets in. Terry grabs Hale. 
TERRY Come on! 
HALE The sock -- More bullets. Terry pulls Hale. They run down a side passage. Hale and Terry fire back at Johnson as they run out of sight. 
JOHNSON Shoots after them, then runs up to the weapon. He reaches for the rock, stops -- maybe that'll set it off. 
THE SOCK The last sand pours out; the sock is sucked through the eye-bolt. 
THE ROCK Drops fast toward the nuke. 
A HAND Grabs it, stopping it just in time. The hand belongs to... 
DEAKINS He looks at Johnson in disgust, exhales, and tosses the rock. He pulls out a walkie-talkie, clicks on, talks into it. 
DEAKINS We're at the end of tunnel three. (clicks off; to 
JOHNSON) You two get this one set. I'll take the other one up. 
HALE AND TERRY Running along a tunnel. 
TERRY What do we do? 
HALE Beat 'em back to the elevator. Stop 'em from getting out. Terry nods. They hurry off around a corner and are met by... 
A FLURRY OF BULLETS Fired by... 
DEAKINS With his Uzi. 
HALE AND TERRY Run back down the side tunnel, bullets winging off the rock all around them, shooting back. Hale starts shooting out the lights, plunging the tunnel into darkness. 
DEAKINS Slows down. 
DEAKINS The bit with the sock was good. I like it. Still, I'm gonna use the the Field Expedient Tactical Timer. It's a little more precise. 
(BEAT) See, Hale -- you aren't the only one who's thought of setting off a nuke in this mine. 
BY THE NUKE Kelly is there with Johnson. Kelly flips on a lamp on a headstrap, giving him better light as he opens up the metal briefcase he's been carrying. 
INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE An elaborate electronic timer. 
IN THE TUNNELS Deakins pulls out a fresh clip. 
DEAKINS I need a demonstration. Otherwise, some swinging dick in Washington is going to say I don't have the balls or the ability to set off a nuclear weapon. I'm gonna show these puppies I'm ready, willing and able. Hell, I'm eager. Deakins jams in his clip, walks into the dark part of the tunnel. 
HALE AND TERRY In the dark, waiting to ambush Deakins and then... 
DEAKINS Opens fire -- but not at Hale and Terry -- at the cable along the ceiling connecting the lights. The cable snaps and electrical sparks shoot out, flooding the tunnel with light, showing... 
HALE AND TERRY Suddenly exposed to Deakins' fire. The bullets whiz in. 
DEAKINS The muzzle flashes from his Uzi give away his position and Hale and Terry's bullets scream in at him. He backs around a corner. 
HALE AND TERRY Take cover. It's a stand-off. 
DEAKINS Well, Hale, I better be going. Look at it this way, partner. If you wanted to get closer to God, you are about to get your wish. Hale hears Deakins' footsteps start off. 
HALE You're gonna ransom Salt Lake City, aren't you? The footsteps stop. 
DEAKINS What makes you think that? 
HALE That's where St. Judes Hospital is. You're gonna hide the nukes near the radiology department so they won't show up an any satellite radiation scans. 
DEAKINS I'm impressed. 
HALE How much are you gonna ask for? 
Deakins and Pritchett get the nuke into the back of the Humvee. 
INT. BOTTOM OF ELEVATOR SHAFT 
TERRY We can go back, try to shut it down. 
HALE We don't know the code, and Deak'd have it wired to blow if we so much as look at it funny. 
TERRY Then we're... Hale looks at her. 
HALE I'm sorry. I shouldn't've let you come. 
TERRY Oh, God. Hale takes Terry in his arms, holds her. 
TERRY I ... I just hope someone remembers to feed my dog. Hale nods, hugs Terry. Terry starts to say something else, but Hale puts a finger to his lips -- he's heard something -- a distant rushing. 
HALE Come on. Hale pulls Terry, running, down the far tunnel. 
TERRY What're you --? 
HALE You said they shut down the mine when they hit an underground river. 
INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE 
Deakins slams the tailgate on the Humvee shut. From the distance, he and Pritchett hear the whump-whump-whump of a helicopter. Deakins motions Pritchett to stay. 
EXT. MINE ENTRANCE 
Deakins comes out, looks up, sees... 
THE NEST HELICOPTER Coming toward him, two miles away. 
INT. NEST HELICOPTER 
Hunt sees something, points. 
HUNT Ten o'clock! In the clearing! 
HIS POV The blackened Humvee and Deakins by the mine entrance. 
INT. MINE TUNNEL 
Hale and Terry run up. The tunnel comes to an end at a big hole. The rushing sound comes from the hole. They step up to the edge and look down. 
THEIR POV Dark water rushes by ten feet below them. 
HALE Any idea where it goes? 
TERRY No. They look at each other. They don't have any choice. They flick on their flashlights and jump. They-hit the water and are swept from view. 
INT. MINESHAFT ENTRANCE 
Deakins enters, motions for Pritchett to get into the Humvee. 
DEAKINS Get in. We're leaving. 
PRITCHETT (re: Kelly and 
JOHNSON) Aren't you going to wait for them? 
DEAKINS No time. And if they get out, they might talk. Fortunately, there's something wrong with the elevator. Deakins opens fire with his Uzi on the generator. Sparks fly and the thing shuts down. 
INT. ELEVATOR 
Kelly is jarred when the elevator stops and the lights dim. 
EXT. MINE ENTRANCE 
(MORE) 
DEAKINS (cont'd) (thinks about it, 
SHRUGS) I don't know what the big deal is. 
INT. MINE - END OF TUNNEL 
ECU NUKE TIMER Eighteen seconds left. 
KELLY Runs up, starts entering numbers into the timer keypad. 
INT./EXT. NEST HELICOPTER 
The NEST helicopter closes fast on Deakins. They are a couple hundred feet above him, a quarter mile back. 
HUNT Let him know we're here! 
EXT. 4WD TRAIL 
A line of bullets kicks up dust in front of Deakins' Humvee. 
INT. HUMVEE 
Deakins looks at... 
THE TRIP ODOMETER It clicks over from 2.9 to 3.0 miles. 
DEAKINS Grins, steps on the brakes. 
EXT. 4WD TRAIL 
The Humvee stops and Deakins gets out, arms above his head. 
THE NEST HELICOPTER A hundred feet in the air, slowly coming in toward Deakins. 
INT. MINE - END OF TUNNEL 
ECU NUKE TIMER Eleven, ten, nine... 
KELLY Punches in the last two numbers of the code then ENTER. 
ECU NUKE TIMER It stops with seven seconds left. The amber light goes off and the red light comes on. 
KELLY Sits back on the floor, takes a breath. 
EXT. 4WD TRAIL 
Deakins is watching the helicopter. Strangely, he is grinning. Then the camera CLOSES IN fast on... 
DEAKINS' HAND He's holding a small black box. He presses a button and... 
INT. MINE - END OF TUNNEL 
Kelly hears a click. He looks over at... 
THE TIMER The red light goes out. The amber light comes on. A splitsecond later, the green light comes on. 
KELLY Oh shit. The screen goes white. 
EXT. 4WD TRAIL 
DEAKINS Watching the helicopter, listening to Hunt over the loudspeaker. 
HUNT (V.O.) Do not move or you will be fired -- 
THE GROUND Rises up beneath Deakins. 
EXT. 4WD TRAIL 
The Humvee races along the trail. 
IN THE HUMVEE Deakins and the dead Pritchett motor along. Deakins turns to Pritchett as if Pritchett had just asked him a question. 
DEAKINS The helicopter? It was hit by EMP. Electromagnetic pulse. It's released in a nuclear detonation. It wipes out anything electronic for miles. That"s another reason I wanted to set off a nuke. I knew it'd bring down any helicopters coming for us. It'll also shut down all radio communications for a few hours, which will severely screw up their response. 
(GRINS) You see, Mr. Pritchett? There really is nothing for you to worry about. Pritchett's body seems to nod from the motion of the Humvee. 
EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVER BANK 
BUTTERFLIES Hover and dance over the water in the early morning light. 
HALE Hale has his shirt off and is wringing it out. 
TERRY (O.S.) Goddamn it! He turns to see Terry trying to undo her buttons but unable to her fingers are too numb. 
TERRY Stupid buttons. I hate these shirts. They're ugly and stupid and -- Terry suddenly starts crying. It's not the shirt she's upset about. Hale holds her. 
HALE It's okay. 
TERRY We just ... I mean, we almost... 
HALE I know. 
TERRY A nuclear bomb went off. 
HALE That it did. 
TERRY Are we...? 
HALE Look. (points at 
BUTTERFLIES) If the butterflies are okay, then we'll be okay. 
TERRY Really? 
HALE Absolutely. It says so in the manual. "If you see butterflies after a detonation, you are fine." Terry looks at Hale. She knows he's bullshitting her, but she appreciates it. They look at each other. They could kiss ... but they both shy away from it. Terry gets her shirt off. 
HALE We better get moving. We might be able to reach Deakins when he gets to the river. They start off along a trail by the river. 
HALE Something I've been meaning to ask. (Terry looks at him) How did someone like you end up with a gun? 
TERRY I hit a bankrobber with a frozen chicken. 
HALE Excuse me? 
TERRY I came out here one summer during college. It was the campaign to stop the dam in the Grand Canyon. I loved it here. I came back, worked as a river guide and eventually stayed year-round. When a Park Ranger job came open, I applied. 
HALE I'm still waiting for the chicken. 
TERRY The local Parks Department wasn't sure how I'd do with the law enforcement part of the job. Well, one night I was coming home from the store and Tommy Drewson part of the local brain trust was robbing old Bob Kearney in front of the ATM. I bear old Bob yelling and I see Tommy heading for his car, so I tossed a bag of groceries at him at thirty miles an hour. A frozen chicken in the bag hit him in the forehead and he dropped like a rock. Next thing I know, I'm a Ranger. Hale looks at Terry with a new appreciation. 
EXT. 4WD TRAIL 
Deakins pilots the Humvee along the trail. 
EXT. COLORADO RIVER - RIVERBANK TRAIL 
Hale and Terry are crouching behind a rock, looking down. 
THEIR POV A zodiac raft has been pulled up on the river bank. A man with an Uzi -- SHEPPARD -- waits, duffel bag by his feet. 
TERRY Get me a frozen Zacky's fryer and he's a dead man. There's the sound of an approaching engine. Sheppard stands, gun ready. The engine stops. A few seconds later... 
DEAKINS Appears, walking down a footpath toward Sheppard. 
HALE He planted that. He wanted whoever found it to think that's where he was going. (Shakes head) He's been doing a rope-a-dope. Giles and Wilkins look at him like he's nuts. 
HALE It's a boxing term. When Ali -- Look, I know this guy. If everything has been saying he's heading north, then he's heading south. They look at him, then Wilkins grabs the map. 
WILKINS What's south of here? 
ECU MAP Wilkins' finger follows the train line on the map. It goes right into Las Vegas. 
HALE No. Not Vegas. What the hell is there to blow up in Vegas? Wilkins' finger keeps moving on the map. 
GILES The President. Wilkins' finger stops. 
EXT. TRAIN 
Deakins jumps the gap between two boxcars and walks on. We ANGLE DOWN to reveal... 
TERRY Crouching down between the two cars. 
INT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT 
Sheppard is working with a torch, welding the brake and accelerator controls. Deakins enters. Sheppard turns the torch down. Deakins lights a cigarette off it. 
DEAKINS How much longer? 
SHEPPARD Almost done. 
INT. TRAIN ENGINE ENGINE AREA 
Behind the driver's compartment is the engine itself, with walkways along either side. 
TERRY Creeps-up to one of the doors that lead into the driver's compartment. She hears... 
SHEPPARD (O.S.) How long until the helicopter gets here? 
INT. DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT 
DEAKINS Five minutes. We'll leave from the boxcar roof. 
Deakins turns to go. 
INT. TRAIN ENGINE - ENGINE AREA 
Deakins opens the door and strides along beside the engine. 
TERRY Is hiding on the other side of the engine, very quiet and still. As Deakins goes out the back door of the engine, Terry follows. 
EXT. TRAIN - BETWEEN ENGINE AND BOXCAR 
Terry comes out the door and is about to step across to the ladder on the boxcar when we PULL BACK to reveal... 
DEAKINS As he puts a gun to the back of Terry's head. 
EXT. GAS STATION AND MINI-MART 
A RANCHER comes out of the mini-mart with a cup of coffee and heads for his old pickup truck. He starts to open his door when he hears, incongruously, whump-whump-whump. He looks up as... 
WILKINS' HELICOPTER Comes in, gets about three feet off the ground and Giles jumps out. As Giles runs to a payphone, the helicopter pulls up and flies away, leaving the Rancher agog. 
INT. NUKE BOXCAR 
Terry comes down the ladder from the hatch, followed by Deakins with a gun. 
DEAKINS Terry, Max. Max, Terry. 
MAX (to Terry) A pleasure. (to Deakins) What the hell is a "Terry" and why is it still live? 
DEAKINS She asked me how I thought I was going to get away with this and I thought I'd tell her. (to Terry) We're going to a cabin in the mountains, not far from here. When we get there I'm gonna make two phone calls. 
DEAKINS It's not a problem. Set the timer, then kill her. Have fun with it. Deakins starts climbing up the ladder to the hatch. 
EXT. TRAIN 
The GUNMAN at the caboose is firing on Wilkins's helicopter, hanging a hundred yards off the back of the train. 
INT. NUKE BOXCAR 
Max holds a pistol on Terry with one hand while he quickly sets the timer with the other. 
TERRY'S HAND Rests on Max's tool tray. Her fingers creep over to a vrench. 
MAX Presses ENTER and finishes setting the timer. 
MAX There. 
TERRY AND MAX Terry swings hard and fast with the wrench, knocking the gun out of Max's hand. Max spins, and when Terry swings at him again. Max kicks the wrench out of her hand, then steps up fast and hits Terry under the chin with the heel of his hand. She drops straight back. 
MAX Thought I was just friendly old Max, huh? Lady, I was a Navy SEAL. You should see what I can do with just my thumb. Max goes for his gun. 
TERRY'S HAND Grabs onto something. It's the wrench. 
TERRY AND MAX As Max turns back with the gun, Terry heaves the wrench. It hits Max square in the forehead. He drops like a rock. 
TERRY Yeah? Well, you should see what I can do with just a chicken. 
EXT. TRAIN - CABOOSE 
Deakins joins his man on top of the caboose, firing on Wilkins, helicopter. 
INT. HELICOPTER 
Wilkins and Hale are returning fire. Hale points at Deakins. 
HALE That's him! 
WILKINS (to pilot) Get him! 
PILOT They've got guns! 
WILKINS You've got a helicopter. Use it! 
EXT. TRAIN 
Deakins and the gunman keep firing on the helicopter as... 
THE HELICOPTER Comes swooping in. 
DEAKINS Sees what's going to happen and turns and runs as... 
THE HELICOPTER Drops down beside the train. The rotor blades whip about three feet over the train roof and the pilot starts forward. 
DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN Run from the blades as fast as they can. 
THE HELICOPTER Closes fast. 
DEAKINS AND THE GUNMAN Jump from car to car. The gunman passes Deakins. Just when the helicopter blades are about to catch up to Deakins... 
DEAKINS Jumps down between two boxcars and the rotor blades go right over his head. Deakins hears an awful sound and a scream cut short. 
HELICOPTER POV Swooping fast over the train when suddenly... 
TERRY Pops up out of the hatch, her back to the helicopter. 
HALE (O.S.) Pull up! 
THE HELICOPTER Pulls up fast. 
INT. TRAIN ENGINE - DRIVER'S COMPARTMENT 
Terry comes into the driver's compartment. She tugs at the brake and accelerator levers. It's useless. She looks around, spots a cigarette lighter. 
INT. BOXCAR 
Deakins and the one remaining GUNMAN hear the helicopter. They start toward the ladder to the roof hatch when they hear footsteps on the roof of the car. Deakins gestures to the gunman. He raises his gun, trying to figure out where to shoot. Then they hear someone tugging at the hatch handle. The gunman opens fire on the hatch. 
EXT. ON TOP OF BOXCAR 
Bullets stream up through the hatch cover, but Hale is nowhere in sight. One end of Hale's helicopter winch cable is tied to the hatch cover. 
We follow the cable fast, over to the side of the boxcar to find... 
HALE Standing, tugging on the cable, still attached to the harness. Hale racks a load in the shotgun and jumps back off the side of the train. 
INT. BOXCAR 
The gunman hears a sound, starts to turn, just as... 
HALE Swings into the boxcar on the cable, firing the shotgun. 
THE GUNMAN Is picked up by the blast and smashed back through the wood slat wall of the boxcar and out of the train. 
DEAKINS Climbs up fast through the hatch to the roof. 
HALE Shoots at Deakins, misses. The shotgun clicks empty. Hale tosses the gun then unhooks the cable from the harness. He drops to the floor-of the boxcar and runs to the ladder. 
EXT. CAR CARRIER 
Terry has a three-foot length of gasoline-soaked cloth stuffed into the gas tank opening of a Toyota on the lower level of the car carrier. She lights it and hurries off. 
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN 
Deakins steadies himself as... 
THE RED CROSS HELICOPTER Hovers in sideways toward the train. The MAN in the doorway holds out a hand to Deakins. 
DEAKINS Is reaching for the man's hand and grabs it when... 
HALE Reaches out of the hatch and grabs onto Deakins' foot. 
HALE AND DEAKINS Deakins kicks free of Hale, holds onto the man in the helicopter and is pulled onboard. 
THE HELICOPTER Moves sideways over the train. 
IN THE HELICOPTER Deakins turns, pulling his gun and shoots down at the train as... 
THE HELICOPTER Moves back sideways over the train. 
DEAKINS' POV No sign of Hale on the train roof. 
DEAKINS Get us out of here! 
THE PILOT Nods and starts to lift and bank. Then he gets an odd expression. The helicopter isn't doing what he wants. 
THE HELICOPTER Is hovering over the train, but it can't fly away because... 
HALE Is hanging onto the skids and he's hooked the cable to the skid. The other end of the cable is still attached to the hatch. 
THE HELICOPTER Strains against the cable, but it doesn't snap. 
IN THE HELICOPTER 
DEAKINS Hurry! 
POWER LINES Cross the track, a quarter-mile ahead. 
CU TRAIN AXLE The axle is bending, grinding, groaning. 
TERRY Is between the car carrier and a boxcar, looking down at the axle, not knowing what the hell she's going to do when she hears a horn honking. She turns. 
INT. BOXCAR 
DEAKINS Used to be, every fight was to a knockout. You know what happens when you get knocked out? It's your brain slapping against the inside of your skull. Here. I'll let you see what it's like. Ready? Deakins steps toward Hale, about to finish him off. Deakins swings. Hale ducks, comes up hard with all he's got, gets Deakins under the chin and Deakins sails up and back, landing prone, seeing stars. 
HALE Stands over Deakins, in silhouette, the light of the hatch above him. And then... 
EXT. THE TRAIN AXLE 
Snaps and... 
THE TRAIN Jumps the tracks. 
INT. BOXCAR 
Hale is thrown off his feet. 
THE NUCLEAR WEAPON Swings wildly in the hammock webbing. 
THE STRAPS Securing the webbing to the walls of the car start to snap. 
EXT. TRAIN 
The front cars accordion sideways off the tracks, down a short, steep, embankment. It's all grinding, twisting, groaning metal. 
FLAMING TOYOTAS Fly, tumble, explode. 
INT. BOXCAR 
Hale tries to get to his feet, but then the floor starts dropping below him as... 
EXT. THE TRAIN 
THE NUKE BOXCAR Goes down the steep slope of the embankment and stops. 
THE TRAIN The sounds of the crash cease. Dust and smoke. Burning Toyotas. 
INT. BOXCAR 
Flickering light from a burning Toyota comes in through the slatted walls. In this weird light, Hale sees... 
THE NUCLEAR WEAPON It's above him, at the end (top) of the car. It's hanging in mid-air, tangled up in the webbing. Two straps are the only things keeping the nuclear weapon from dropping twenty feet to the bottom of the car. 
DEAKINS Is lying at the bottom (end) of the car, directly under the nuke, not moving. 
HALE Looks around for something. He sees it -- 
DEAKINS' REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE On the floor. 
DEAKINS' EYES Flicker open. He sees... 
A PISTOL Lying a few feet away. 
HALE 
DEAKINS (O.S.) You have to push amber, then red. You might have time to push amber. You won't get to red. Hale turns to see... 
DEAKINS Pointing a gun at him. 
HALE The nuke is armed, Deak. If it falls, the impact trigger will set it off. 
DEAKINS I know. 
HALE Half a million people will die.

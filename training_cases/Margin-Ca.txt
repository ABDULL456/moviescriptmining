INT. LARGE INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY 
The frame is filled with the face of PETER SULLIVAN, a 27- year-old risk assessment analyst. He has a Doctorate from MIT and is staring intently into a large bank of computer screens. 
An elevator door opens and FOUR HUMAN RESOURCES PEOPLE come out of the elevator carrying large file boxes. They walk down a long glass enclosed hallway that runs the full length of the trading floor. The scope of the floor now comes into frame. There are more computers than can be imagined and several large boards on the far walls that are scrolling thousands of numbers. PETER gives a knowing glance to the guy sitting next to him, SETH BREGMAN, a young analyst in his early twenties. 
SETH Is that them? 
PETER (nods yes) 
SETH Jesus Christ. 
The HUMAN RESOURCES people turn and separate into a large glass walled conference room that runs along the floor as almost every person on the floor watches. 
SETH (cont'd) Are they going to do it right there? 
PETER Yeah. 
SETH Fuck me. 
WILL EMERSON, sitting next to them, leans back in his chair. 
WILL EMERSON (whispered) Have you guys ever seen this before? 
SETH No. 
WILL EMERSON Best to just ignore it. Keep your head down and get back to work... and don't watch. 
(CONTINUED) 1   CONTINUED:                                                   1 
The HR people begin walking out onto the floor looking at a piece of paper in their hand then walking up behind a person and asking their name. It is brutal. The camera follows one HR woman, HEATHER, with her piece of paper down the hall and into a row of employees, she walks right past the THREE GUYS then stops a bit down from them. 
HEATHER Timothy Singh? 
TIMOTHY Yes. 
HEATHER I'm afraid we have to speak with you. 
TIM gets up and walks back towards the conference room with the woman. PETER puts on his headphones and very loud RAP MUSIC drowns out all other noise and PETER tries to get lost back into the numbers on his computer screen. 
The sequence follows the HR people walking around and firing people intercut with PETER just staring at his computer screen. It runs for almost the length of the song until finally the same woman comes walking back down the hall and stops behind PETER and taps him on the shoulder. He takes off his headphones and the MUSIC STOPS. He is shell-shocked. 
HEATHER (cont'd) Eric Dale? 
PETER Excuse me? 
HEATHER Eric Dale? 
PETER No. 
HEATHER Sorry? 
PETER I'm not Eric Dale. 
HEATHER Oh. I'm so sorry. 
PETER He's my boss, he's down that hall. 
INT. ERIC DALE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS A1                                                                   A1 
ERIC DALE is sitting at his desk, he is 52 years old and looks exhausted. He looks out through the glass of his office as she walks over to the door. 
HEATHER Mr. Dale? 
ERIC Yes. 
HEATHER This way. 
SAM falls into the couch and looks forward in a deflated daze. His eyes no longer believe what he says. 
EXT. INVESTMENT BANK BUILDING PLAZA/STREET LEVEL - EVENING 
ERIC DALE walks out the front door carrying the file boxes. There are other people streaming out the door doing the same thing. ERIC stops, turns, and looks up at the building then tries to make a phone call but his phone does not work as it has been shut off by the firm. He looks up to the sky and can't believe his fate. As he looks down he sees a woman, SARAH ROBERTSON, serious, classically beautiful and dressed in a well tailored power suit with her head down walking into the building. He can't help himself. 
(CONTINUED) 9    CONTINUED:                                                      9 
ERIC Robertson! 
SARAH does not respond. 
ERIC (cont'd) Sarah Robertson! 
This time she looks up. When she sees him she debates if she should stop. She does. He slowly moves a little closer to her, still carrying the slightly tattered box with his personal belongings in it. 
ERIC (cont'd) You shut off my phone??? 
SARAH ROBERTSON Eric... I didn't do anything. 
They stare at each other. 
ERIC Fuck you. 
They look at each other for a longer beat, both a little shocked that ERIC was so openly confrontational. She turns and heads back inside quickly. ERIC drops the phone to the ground and walks away. 
INT. TRADING FLOOR - EVENING 
Most of the remaining traders are packing up and getting ready to go home or out for the night. PETER is sitting at his desk holding the portable hard drive. SETH is getting ready to leave behind him. PETER stares down at the drive in his hand trying to decide whether to proceed. 
SETH You ok? 
PETER Yeah. Just a little freaked out. 
SETH You want to get a drink? 
PETER Nah, I need to clean up a few things around here. 
SETH Everyone is going out... come on. 
(CONTINUED) 10   CONTINUED:                                                    10 
PETER Nah, I'm fine. 
SETH Well, give me a call if you change your mind. 
PETER I will. 
SETH Come on. 
PETER Where are you going? 
SETH The Grand. 
PETER I'll call you when I'm done. 
SETH Be glad, you're still alive. 
PETER I am. 
SETH walks out and PETER puts on his headphones, the MUSIC kicks in again. He picks up the portable hard drive, looks around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. He has four large screens in front of him and as he begins opening window upon window of mathematical models his face begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. The frame is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers flying by. 
HARD CUT: 
INT. VETERINARIANS OFFICE ANIMAL VISITATION ROOM - NIGHT 
SAM is sitting next to the exam table, his dog is on the table lying down very sedated. They both stare forward. 
INT. THE SOHO GRAND BAR - NIGHT 
In a locked off shot SETH and WILL are sitting on a couch staring forward. Figures cross frame and occasionally another banker in the group stops to refill his drink with one of the three bottles in ice buckets on the table in front of them. They are celebrating, but it seems a little forced. 
INT. INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - NIGHT 
PETER is still working on the numbers, although his face starts to carry a more serious look. He is now wearing glasses and the numbers on the screen are reflected in them. The numbers finally stop moving on the screen and then he takes his glasses off and rubs his eyes. 
SETH Hey. 
WILL is a bit drunk but SETH looks at PETER'S face and realizes something is up. 
SETH (cont'd) What's going on? 
PETER Look at this. 
SETH comes around and sits at PETER'S desk. 
PETER (cont'd) Eric gave me this file before he left. 
SETH Eric? 
PETER Dale. And he told me he couldn't quite figure it out, then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is `be careful'. 
WILL EMERSON Be careful? 
PETER So I'm obviously a little curious. So I get into it a bit and I realize that all he was missing was...well it's not good. 
(CONTINUED) 18   CONTINUED:                                                      18 
SETH looks at the screen and starts to scroll through the pages. 
SETH What is he doing here? 
PETER Go to model four, and it makes more sense. 
SETH Oh. 
WILL is now paying closer attention, standing over their shoulder. 
WILL EMERSON What is this? 
PETER This is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time. But what Eric was trying to do here is work it for levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard VAR model. 
WILL EMERSON What are those levels. 
PETER Well it's a fairly complicated... 
WILL EMERSON Simplify. 
PETER The volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another 10-15%... roughly. 
WILL EMERSON So what's happening? 
SETH We are starting to test those historic patterns. 
WILL EMERSON When? 
PETER starts scrolling back through the last couple weeks on his screen 
(CONTINUED) 18   CONTINUED: (2)                                                18 
PETER Today. 
SETH Tuesday. 
PETER Monday, last Friday, last Wednesday and Monday. 
SETH Two Fridays ago. 
WILL EMERSON I get it. 
SETH scrolls the final page on the graph. 
SETH Fuck me... Once this thing gets going in the wrong direction... 
PETER Yeah... 
SETH It's huge. 
WILL EMERSON How huge? 
SETH The losses are greater than the current value of the company...? 
SAM ROGERS And? 
WILL gives him a long pause. 
WILL EMERSON ...it isn't good. 
WILL'S look gets SAM up and he comes over to stand behind WILL at his desk and look at the computer. 
WILL EMERSON (cont'd) As far as I can tell these here are the historical volatility index limits... which I guess our whole fucking trading model relies on pretty heavily... and we are so fucking levered up that if this thing starts getting outside those limits it gets ugly in a hurry. 
SAM ROGERS How ugly? 
(CONTINUED) 24   CONTINUED: (3)                                                24 
WILL EMERSON Real ugly. 
SAM ROGERS And how close to those limits have we gotten? 
WILL EMERSON Oh we're beyond close... We broke through five or six days over the last two weeks, but we've managed to stay on the upside of it... for now... 
SAM ROGERS For now? 
WILL EMERSON Well look what happens here when we get on the wrong side of it. 
SAM ROGERS What am I looking at? 
WILL takes his finger and points at a red number with a whole lot of zeroes after it. SAM'S look says it all. 
WILL EMERSON And that wouldn't even be that bad a day for us... historically speaking. 
SAM ROGERS Is this right? 
WILL EMERSON I don't know. 
SAM ROGERS Where is Eric? 
WILL EMERSON We shut his phone off. 
SAM ROGERS Of course we did. 
WILL EMERSON And he hasn't come home yet, I spoke to his wife. 
SAM ROGERS He's probably crying in a fucking beer somewhere. 
(CONTINUED) 24   CONTINUED: (4)                                              24 
WILL EMERSON Or worse. 
SAM ROGERS Where's the kid who did this? 
WILL EMERSON Out looking for Eric. 
SAM ROGERS Do we think he knows what he's doing? 
WILL EMERSON I don't know. What do I know? 
SAM ROGERS Well get him back here. 
INT. UPSCALE CABARET CLUB ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE- CONTINUOUS 25 
PETER and SETH are sitting at the bar each with a drink facing camera. There are women dancing in the background and one dancing in front of them, PETER and SETH look up occasionally. 
PETER What now? 
SETH We should probably tell Will he's not here. 
PETER Yeah. 
They both just continue to look forward and sip their drinks. 
SETH What do you think this girl makes in a night? 
PETER Seth. 
SETH 
PETER That's fucked up. 
SETH Why? 
PETER Does that seem right to you? 
(CONTINUED) 27   CONTINUED: (2)                                              27 
SETH Right? 
PETER Jesus. 
SETH So what do you think that means Rogers puts away? 
PETER I have no idea. 
They both just look straight forward, SETH takes a big gulp of the beer. 
PETER (cont'd) This fucking traffic. We should have taken a the subway. 
INT. TRADING FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK- FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER 
The doors of the elevator open and PETER and SETH look up as WILL EMERSON and SAM ROGERS are standing in front of them about to get onto the elevator. WILL and SAM are now dressed with fresh shirts, ties, and suits and look as if they are ready to start a new day even though it is almost one in the morning. SETH is still holding the forty in the paper bag. Will looks at it. They share a glancing smile. WILL and SAM step into the elevator keeping the guys in it. 
WILL EMERSON Gentlemen? 
SAM ROGERS You're coming with us. 
SETH Will. Mr. Rogers. 
WILL EMERSON Sam this is Seth Bregman and this is Peter Sullivan. 
SETH Sir. 
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
SAM ROGERS Guys. 
(CONTINUED) 29   CONTINUED:                                                     29 
They all stand in silence as the elevator heads up until: 
PETER Will? 
WILL EMERSON Yes? 
PETER Where are we going? 
SAM ROGERS Going to get a second opinion on your work Peter. 
PETER and SETH look at each other, growing more concerned. The doors open and they exit. 
INT. HALLWAY BY JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
SETH looks for somewhere to throw out his beer but can't find a trash can. They follow SAM and WILL down a long hallway that is crowded with assistant cubicles. Eventually they turn into a small conference room that has no windows. It is claustrophobic. 
INT. JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
There are four people sitting at the table. They stand. Everyone says their somber hellos and shakes hands. 
ALL PRESENT Slight hellos, etc. 
They all sit down and at each place setting there is a pad of paper, a pencil, and an empty binder. Sitting at the head of the table is JARED COHEN. He is a blond boyish looking 43 year old, although carries himself with intense confidence. He is the head of all fixed income securities, and oversees roughly 25,000 employees. Next to him is his chief risk management officer, SARAH ROBERTSON, the same woman from outside the building earlier who had the run in with ERIC. Next to her is her right hand man RAMESH SHAH, a sixty year old number cruncher and next to him is a firm lawyer. They are all dressed sharply for a new day. Long silence. 
SETH COUGHS. 
ALL PRESENT look down at him. 
JARED COHEN So Sam, what do you have for us? 
(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED:                                                       31 
SAM ROGERS Well... it should be here in a minute. Finding someone in the copy room at this hour was a little bit of a challenge. 
JARED COHEN Well why don't we start by introducing everyone then. 
JARED COHEN What time is it? 
RAMESH It's 2:15. 
SAM and JARED just look at each other in silence for a bit. 
JARED COHEN What do you have in exposure right now, tonight? 
SAM ROGERS I don't know... between 900 and 1.3... roughly. 
(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED: (4)                                                31 
RAMESH If Mr. Sullivan's numbers are correct... 
RAMESH looks down at the sheet in front of him to go through the numbers and takes a beat too long. 
PETER 1.215 Trillion. 
RAMESH checks his number. 
RAMESH Yes. 
JARED COHEN Fuck me... fuck me... And I'm guessing by the fact that you two haven't said anything that the math checks out? 
JARED looks over at SARAH and RAMESH. SARAH then looks to RAMESH. She looks back. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Look    we'd need a little more time to go over    this, but Mr. Sullivan here seems to know    what he's doing. And I don't have to tell    you that this is a problem. 
JARED COHEN Thank you for that. What time is it? 
RAMESH 
JARED COHEN Fuck me! 
Jared stands up and walks around the small room. The rest of the room goes silent. Finally: 
JARED COHEN (cont'd) Sam how long under normal operations would it take your people to clear that from our books? 
SAM ROGERS What? 
JARED COHEN The 1.2 trillion. 
SAM ROGERS All of it? 
(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED: (5)                                                  31 
JARED COHEN Yes. 
SAM ROGERS I don't know, a couple weeks? 
JARED COHEN Weeks? 
SAM ROGERS Yes. But as you certainly know our business is selling AND buying. It doesn't work for very long without both components. If we suddenly stop buying for a day or two that just doesn't hide under the rug, it gets out and this whole this thing comes to a end... and right quick. 
JARED COHEN I understand. 
SAM ROGERS Do you? 
JARED COHEN How many traders do we have left between your floor and Petersen's? 
SAM ROGERS I don't know, sixty. 
RAMESH has been looking down at the numbers while this conversation has been taking place. 
RAMESH Jared I've just been looking here a little closer, and it's these VAR numbers that are really setting this thing off. 
JARED holds up a hand to interrupt Ramesh. Jared nods his head, his eyes are perfectly still but his brain is racing. 
JARED COHEN Excuse me, I need to make a quick call. 
JARED calmly stands up   and steps out of the   room for a long moment. The room stays   completely quiet the   whole time he is gone. We hear nothing.   It is awkward to say   the least. He comes back in and sits   down without missing   a beat. 
JARED COHEN (cont'd) Please... 
(CONTINUED) 31   CONTINUED: (6)                                                31 
SETH Two and a half million goes quickly? 
WILL EMERSON Well the tax man takes half of it up front. So now you got what... million and a quarter. Mortgage grabs another 300K, I gave 150 to my parents to live off, so now you got what?? 
PETER Eight hundred. 
WILL EMERSON I bought a car last year for 150. Probably another 100 eating... 25 on clothes, put 400 away for a rainy day... 
SETH Smart. (smiles) 
(CONTINUED) 39   CONTINUED: (3)                                                39 
WILL EMERSON And what's that? 
PETER 125 left. 
WILL EMERSON takes a long drag off his cigarette. 
WILL EMERSON I spent 76,520 dollars on booze, dancers, and whores. 
PETER 
WILL EMERSON Yeah, kinda shocked me, although I was able to write most of it off, as entertainment. 
With that he flicks his cigarette over the edge of the building just as a massive CORPORATE HELICOPTER comes sweeping up from behind the building and comes right over their heads. 
THEY are now YELLING above the rotor noise. 
PETER                             SETH Whoa!                               Whoa! 
WILL EMERSON (cont'd) What time is it? 
SETH 
WILL EMERSON Oh, here they go. They are bringing in the cavalry! We better get down there. 
INT. JARED COHEN'S CORNER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
JARED and SAM are sitting in the office silently looking out the window. The office is very large and has a full sitting area with two couches. JARED is intensely going over the papers in front of him. SAM is just looking out the window. 
SAM ROGERS How old are you? 
JARED COHEN 
(CONTINUED) 40   CONTINUED:                                                       40 
SAM ROGERS Jesus... 
JARED stops reading with a deeply aware look and just stares out the window as well. 
JARED COHEN This is a very... very bad dream. 
SAM looks over at him directly. 
SAM ROGERS I don't know, seems like we actually may have just finally woken up. 
SARAH ROBERTSON comes to the door. SAM sits up. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Hello. 
JARED COHEN Come in. 
SAM ROGERS How do we look? 
Her look says it all. 
SAM ROGERS (cont'd) I should go. 
SARAH ROBERTSON No, you should stay. 
JARED COHEN So? 
SARAH ROBERTSON (dead calm delivery) It's all legit... the kid killed it. The formula is worthless. 
They all look at each other as if they have seen a ghost. 
He continues on. 
INT. ELEVATOR BANK OUTSIDE JARED'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The guys are taken aback because standing right outside the opening elevator door is a very well dressed page and a female executive assistant who is also dressed perfectly for the day ahead. 
ASSISTANT Mr. Cohen? 
JARED COHEN Yes. 
ASSISTANT This way. They are already in there waiting for you. 
JARED COHEN OK. 
INT. CEO'S EXECUTIVE BOARDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
They come through glass doors and enter a massive conference room with a commanding view of the city. It is filled with people along one side of the table. There are a team of five lawyers, three compliance officers, a couple of key board members, twelve in all. On the near side of the table sits RAMESH SHAH surrounded by empty chairs all alone. The head of the table is empty. 
They all file in and sit down. They all sit in silence... waiting. Finally from a side door JOHN TULD comes walking into the room. He is dressed in a average suit and tie, is not tall, late fifties and doesn't have a hair on his head. He carries himself without much exception. His eyes however tell a far different tale. Intense even at rest. He walks the length of the room, everyone half stands up. 
JOHN TULD Please sit down. 
He then seats himself at the head of the table. Everyone in the room has the printout in front of them. JARED is seated immediately to his left, then SAM, then SARAH, RAMESH, WILL, PETER, and finally SETH. 
JOHN TULD (cont'd) Welcome everyone. I must apologize for dragging you all here at such an uncommon hour but from what I've been told this matter needs to be handled urgently, so urgently in fact that it probably should have been addressed weeks ago... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED:                                                       45 JOHN TULD (cont'd) but that is spilt milk under the bridge. So why doesn't someone please try to explain to me what's the problem here? 
Everyone looks around the room a bit and finally JARED speaks up. 
JARED COHEN Well, Mr. Tuld as I mentioned earlier if you look here at the top page of this printout... 
He cuts him off. 
JOHN TULD Jared, it's a little early for all that, how bout in English? ... Actually I'd like to hear from the guy who put this thing together... Mr. Sullivan is it? Does he speak English? 
JARED COHEN Sir? 
JOHN TULD I'd like to speak to the analyst who seems to have stumbled across this mess. 
JARED COHEN Well, that's Peter Sullivan here. 
JARED looks down the table to PETER, as does everyone else in the room. JARED gives him a go ahead look. 
PETER Sir. 
JOHN TULD Ah, there he is. 
PETER Yes sir. 
JOHN TULD How old are you Mr. Sullivan? 
PETER I'm twenty-seven sir. 
JOHN TULD Please call me John. 
PETER Yes sir. 
(CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED: (2)                                                45 
JOHN TULD So Mr. Sullivan why don't you tell me what you think is going on here, and please speak as you might to a young child or a golden retriever, I didn't get here on my brains I can assure you of that. 
PETER is very nervous. 
PETER Well, sir. As I guess you may or may not know I work for Mr. Rogers here as an associate in the risk assessment and management office at MBS 
JOHN TULD Now you lost me at M... 
PETER Sorry... 
JOHN TULD I was joking Mr. Sullivan. 
PETER Yes... Well as you probably know over the last 36-40 months the firm has begun packaging new MBS products that combine several different traunches of rating classification in one tradable security. This has been very profitable as I imagine you noticed. 
JOHN TULD I have. 
PETER Well the firm is currently doing a considerable amount of this business every day. The problem, which is I guess why we are here tonight, is that it takes us... the firm... almost a month to layer these products correctly thereby posing a challenge from a risk management standpoint. 
The room goes silent again as Mr. Tuld stares back out the window. 
JARED COHEN Sell it all today... 
JOHN TULD smiles just a bit. Then turns. 
JOHN TULD Is that even possible Sam? 
(CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED: (6)                                                 45 
SAM looks across the room at JOHN TULD, they have known each other for 35 years. 
SAM ROGERS It is, but at what cost? 
JOHN TULD I'll pay. 
SAM ROGERS Really? 
JOHN and SAM look and read each other. 
JOHN TULD I think so. 
SAM ROGERS Almost a trillion bucks of paper? 
JOHN TULD Where does it come back to us? 
SAM ROGERS Everywhere. 
JOHN TULD Sam, I don't think you seem to understand what your boy down here just said... if I made you... how would you do it? 
SAM ROGERS looks down at the table for a long, long, beat. 
SAM ROGERS You bring the traders in for their normal 6:30 meeting and you be honest with them, they're gonna know it's the end either way, so you'd have to throw them a bone, and a pretty big one. You'd have to come out of the gate storming... 40 percent done by 10:15 and 70 percent of your positions need to be gone by eleven, cause by lunch the word will be out. No swaps, no nothing, and by two o'clock you'll be getting 65 cents on the dollar, if you're lucky, and the feds will be in here looking up your ass and trying to slow us down. 
JOHN TULD Ramesh? 
He looks to RAMESH SHAH down the table. 
(CONTINUED) 45   CONTINUED: (7)                                                45 
RAMESH They'll slow you down but it's yours to sell. They can't stop you. 
SAM ROGERS John... let's just say we pull that off, which is saying something... the real question is... who are we selling this to? 
JOHN TULD The same people you've been selling this to for the last two years... and whoever else will buy it. 
They look at each other to see if they understand each other. 
SAM ROGERS If you do this you've killed that market for years. It's over. 
JOHN TULD (Nods.) 
SAM ROGERS And you are selling something you know has no value. 
JOHN TULD (cuts him off cold) We are selling to willing buyers at the current fair market price, so that WE may survive, Sam. 
SAM ROGERS You'll never sell a thing to any one of them again. 
JOHN TULD I understand. 
SAM ROGERS Do you? 
JOHN TULD Do you!!! This is it, Sam, this is it! 
The rest of the table is taken aback and just watching them go at it. Silence. 
JOHN TULD (cont'd) It's 4:00... Jared you've got till 5:00 to break this down and draw me up a plan. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 45    CONTINUED: (8)                                                45 JOHN TULD (cont'd) Is there anyone else who actually knows what's in there right now, block by block? 
PETER Eric Dale. 
JOHN TULD Where is Eric Dale? 
SARAH ROBERTSON As of today he is no longer with the firm. 
JOHN TULD I mean if this kid can come up with this...? 
SAM ROGERS I don't think I can go in knowing what I know and put the hammer down on these guys like this. 
JOHN TULD Oh please, when did you become so soft. 
SAM ROGERS Fuck you soft, you're panicking. 
The word panic slaps JOHN TULD in the face. He then calms. 
JOHN TULD If you're the first one out the door Sam, it's not called panicking 
JOHN TULD stares aggressively at SAM. 
SAM ROGERS Look, I obviously don't have all the information that you do. But I think this could destroy this firm. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) A45   CONTINUED: (3)                                               A45 SAM ROGERS (cont'd) You'll never be trusted again. You are knowingly putting people out of business. Full stop. 
JOHN TULD turns away from SAM and heads over to a phone. 
JOHN TULD You let me take care of that. 
SAM heads out the door. 
INT. CEO'S GREETING LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS 
Sam heads into the hallway where everyone is mingling. He walks over to WILL, PETER, and SETH. 
WILL EMERSON How'd that go? 
SAM ROGERS This is a fucking shit show. 
WILL EMERSON They are going to do it? 
SAM ROGERS Probably. 
WILL EMERSON Jesus. 
SAM ROGERS Remember this day boys, remember this day. 
SAM walks out of the room. An assistant comes into the room. 
ASSISTANT Gentlemen, there is some breakfast down the hall if you guys are hungry. 
WILL looks at the guys. 
WILL EMERSON Seth, someone is going to have to get breakfast. And let's face it, it's you. 
INT. CEO'S TOP FLOOR ELEVATOR BANK - CONTINUOUS 
JARED is waiting for the elevator again as SARAH walks up and waits with him in silence. There is a housekeeping person standing next to them as well. The doors open, and all three get in. 
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
SARAH ROBERTSON So what's the strategy here? 
JARED COHEN That's where I'm headed right now, downstairs to work on it with my guys. 
SARAH ROBERTSON No, you and I... with Tuld. 
JARED COHEN I'm not sure we need one, Sarah. That's not the way I've ever done this. 
SARAH ROBERTSON (with distinct sarcasm) Please. 
JARED COHEN He knows where we both have stood on this all along. There's nothing more to do. 
This pushes a button with her. 
SARAH ROBERTSON That's exactly my point, and knowing what was discussed by both you and I with him, I don't see how that can possibly you with anything but a false sense of comfort. 
JARED COHEN I'm not looking for a sense of comfort here, Sarah. I don't think there is one to be found. 
The elevator door opens and the housekeeper gets off. Sarah walks after her, but turns to Tuld first. 
SARAH ROBERTSON So again, what's the strategy here? 
SAM ROGERS Where's he live? 
WILL EMERSON The heights. 
SAM ROGERS looks at his watch. 
(CONTINUED) 50   CONTINUED: (2)                                               50 
WILL EMERSON (cont'd) Should we call Tuld's guy? 
SAM ROGERS No... it's Eric... the last thing we need is those guys going over there, you two go try to get him. 
SAM points to WILL and SETH. 
SAM ROGERS (cont'd) But you've got to be back here by 6:00. 
WILL EMERSON OK. 
INT. SARAH ROBERTSON'S OFFICE 
SARAH is sitting behind her desk looking down at something. JOHN TULD comes to the door and knocks lightly. She looks up surprised to see him. 
JOHN TULD May I come in? 
SARAH ROBERTSON Please, sit. 
JOHN TULD closes the door and sits in front of her desk. Looks around, then looks right at her. 
JOHN TULD So... we are going to do this thing. 
SARAH ROBERTSON OK. 
JOHN TULD It's going to be tight. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Is Sam on board? 
JOHN TULD Not yet. 
TULD pauses. 
JOHN TULD (cont'd) Sarah, I need a head to feed to these traders... and the board... this morning. 
SARAH looks up. 
(CONTINUED) 51   CONTINUED:                                                       51 
SARAH ROBERTSON Is it me or Cohen? 
JOHN TULD It's you. 
They stare at each other, she does not flinch. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Of course you are well aware I filtered several warnings for you and Cohen over a year ago on this? 
JOHN TULD I'm not sure that's the best path for you to be taking at this point... you're going to be taken care of here... 
SARAH ROBERTSON (Nods) 
JOHN TULD Obviously it's quite complicated. 
SARAH ROBERTSON John I was told that in no uncertain terms... 
JOHN TULD It was all a very grey area. 
SARAH ROBERTSON It was actually made very clear at the time, by you and I and Cohen. 
JOHN TULD I'd really prefer that you didn't fight me on this... 
TULD pauses, they look at each other. 
JOHN TULD (cont'd) We all fucked this one up pretty good... 
SARAH ROBERTSON Yes. 
JOHN TULD We need you to stay here till this is all done and the markets close. 
SAM ROGERS comes across the room and over to the sinks to wash his hands. He looks in the mirror, and then decides to wash his face as well. He stares at himself in the mirror. The water drips off his face. He looks old. Just then the door opens and JOHN TULD walks into the room. He does not go to use any of the facilities. He stops and looks to talk to SAM. 
JOHN TULD There he is. 
SAM ROGERS John. 
SAM walks over and takes a towel to wipe off his hands and face. Finally he looks up. 
SAM ROGERS (cont'd) So what's it look like John? 
The line is delivered a bit too lightly for JOHN TULD'S liking. 
JOHN TULD Cohen has done a nice job. It can work. 
SAM ROGERS What does that mean? 
JOHN TULD It means, as you very well know, that you are a very important piece of this puzzle. 
They look directly at each other. 
JOHN TULD (cont'd) Here. 
JOHN TULD hands SAM a single piece of folded paper. SAM opens it and looks at it. 
SAM ROGERS That's very generous. 
(CONTINUED) 55   CONTINUED:                                                       55 
JOHN TULD It's not a gift. I need to know you are with me on this. 
SAM ROGERS I'm with the firm John. 
JOHN TULD is now taking a far more forceful stance, almost blocking the doorway. 
JOHN TULD I won't get what I need out of your boys today unless they believe you... unless they believe in you completely. 
He stares at SAM. 
JOHN TULD (cont'd) Are you in? 
SAM ROGERS I told you I have my reservations. 
JOHN TULD Well you can't have any reservations. 
They both stare at each other. 
JOHN TULD (cont'd) And I need to know now. 
SAM looks down at the floor then at the piece of paper in his hand, then long and hard at JOHN TULD. 
SAM ROGERS I'm with the firm completely John, as I always have been. Excuse me. 
SAM slightly moves JOHN out of the way and then he exits, the door closes. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING 
There is a haunting blue light bouncing through the buildings. PETER is walking through the streets with mid-size headphones on his ears. The music is all we hear. He wanders around the almost completely empty city and the further he walks the less his face changes. 
EXT. CITY STREET - STREET CART - MORNING 
PETER finally stops to get a coffee at a small street cart. He takes off his headphones to pay and the music stops. The wind blows. 
(CONTINUED) 57   CONTINUED:                                                     57 
COFFEE GUY One fifty. 
PETER Thank you. 
PETER turns around and starts walking but as he looks up he see the figure of a woman coming towards him. It is immediately obvious that he knows her. He stops and she keeps slowly walking towards him. They stop in front of each other squarely. 
LUCY Hey... 
PETER Hi. It's really good to see you. 
She has a very sweet face but looks tired. She appears to be a bartender or something, she is not dressed for banking. 
WILL EMERSON Peter finished that model you were working on. 
ERIC Really? 
WILL EMERSON It's created a bit of a shit storm. 
ERIC Yeah, I bet. 
WILL EMERSON Do you want to see it... the model? 
(CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED:                                                       60 
ERIC No. 
WILL EMERSON Really? 
ERIC No. But I'm pretty sure what it says. 
WILL EMERSON Do you think he's right? 
ERIC I'm sure he's right. 
They both sit down on the stoop. 
WILL EMERSON Jared Cohen called an emergency meeting of the partners tonight. John Tuld has decided to liquidate our entire position. 
ERIC looks over at Will 
WILL EMERSON (cont'd) Today. 
ERIC'S face doesn't show much emotion. But he is surprised and sincere. 
ERIC Well, I am very sorry to hear that. 
WILL EMERSON They want me to get you back there, they are worried about you being out here. 
ERIC (with pleasant disgust) Please. 
WILL EMERSON I'm just saying. 
ERIC (cuts him off cold) Not a chance. 
WILL lets it sit for a few beats. 
WILL EMERSON This is serious shit Eric. 
(CONTINUED) 60   CONTINUED: (2)                                                60 
ERIC You don't think I know that. I've been warning that cunt Robertson about this shit since last March. 
WILL EMERSON Well... 
ERIC Fuck her... Fuck her. 
WILL EMERSON Look... 
ERIC I signed my papers man, I'm out. They've got nothing on me anymore. 
WILL EMERSON They'll pay... 
ERIC looks over at WILL. WILL lets him know with a look that they mean real money. 
ERIC I've already been paid enough by them. 
ERIC looks back out onto the empty street. 
ERIC (cont'd) Did you know I built a bridge once? 
WILL EMERSON I'm sorry? 
ERIC A bridge. 
WILL EMERSON No, I didn't. 
ERIC I was an engineer by trade. 
He gets in his car and drives away. 
INT. WILL EMERSON'S CONVERTIBLE - DAY 
WILL and SETH are driving slowly towards downtown Manhattan which spans up and out in front of them through the windshield. There is a long silence, and finally. 
SETH So, am I getting fired? 
WILL EMERSON I don't know. 
Very long pause, then he looks over at SETH and decides whether to tell the truth. 
WILL EMERSON (cont'd) Probably...yes...almost definitely. 
SETH Are you? 
WILL EMERSON No. 
This clearly hits SETH but he recovers quickly. 
SETH Oh. 
WILL EMERSON It's not personal, you're just in the wrong place at the wrong time, the young guys are always the first to go. Nothing I say is gonna make you feel any better. 
(CONTINUED) 61   CONTINUED:                                                       61 
SETH I get it. 
SETH looks over at WILL and around at the interior of the luxury car and then back into the city. 
SETH (CONT'D) (cont'd) When did you know this is what you wanted to do? 
He thinks that through. 
WILL EMERSON The first time I made 36 million dollars for the firm in the last eleven minutes of the trading day. 
SETH Fuck me. 
WILL EMERSON It was a perfect trade...I saw it coming from three days away. I took my time. I was in, I was out...Pish posh...And it was beautiful. 
SETH How did you learn to do that? 
WILL EMERSON I'm not sure, and whatever it is it could be gone tomorrow. 
WILL looks out again at the city then to SETH. 
WILL EMERSON (CONT'D) (cont'd) Look man I'm sorry about this. 
SETH Don't be, you're not doing it to me. 
WILL EMERSON I know...but I'm still sorry. At least you'll have some decent cash to walk away with. 
SETH Only if we can get this done, right? 
WILL EMERSON We'll get it done. 
SETH How? 
(CONTINUED) 61   CONTINUED: (2)                                                61 
WILL EMERSON I'm trying to figure that out right now. 
SETH There aren't really enough willing buyers out there right now. 
WILL EMERSON I'm trying to think of every last one of them I can and then I'll make them willing. 
This line sits there for a minute and WILL looks out onto the city. 
SETH Are you ok with that? 
WILL EMERSON I'm about to completely fuck guys I've been doing business with for fifteen years so no I'm not exactly ok with it. But look, every last one of them would do the same thing to me in a second...so it is what it is. 
SETH I guess. And what about everyone else? 
WILL EMERSON Everyone else? 
PETER I don't really want to go back in there just yet. 
SAM ROGERS I understand that. 
Long beat. 
PETER I think I know your son. 
SAM ROGERS Really? 
PETER Yeah. Not well... but, he always seemed like a nice person. 
SAM ROGERS He is a nice person. 
A taxi honks and flies by. 
SAM ROGERS (cont'd) I guess you could say alot worse about a guy. 
PETER Have you told him what's about to happen? 
They look at each other to check the nature of the question. 
SAM ROGERS What do you mean? 
PETER This whole thing. 
SAM ROGERS No... I hadn't even thought of it. 
PETER I guess it's illegal anyway? 
(CONTINUED) 62   CONTINUED: (3)                                              62 
SAM ROGERS Yeah... who the fuck knows anymore.... and even if it was you'd sure as hell never get caught. 
PETER He's already pretty rich anyway though right? He doesn't need the help. 
SAM ROGERS laughs quietly. 
SAM ROGERS That's very true. 
PETER He works with a friend of mine. 
SAM ROGERS He's a hell of alot richer than me, I know that much. 
PETER But you are taller. 
Laughs again. 
SAM ROGERS That's true. It's not much... but it's something... What did your father do? 
PETER He's a doctor. 
SAM ROGERS Really? 
PETER Eyes. 
SAM ROGERS Now that's something. 
PETER Yeah... it is. 
SAM ROGERS Did he want you to do that? 
PETER No, never. 
SAM ROGERS Oh. 
(CONTINUED) 62   CONTINUED: (4)                                               62 
PETER He was always a pretty miserable guy actually... 
Another helicopter is heard overhead landing on the building. Peter looks up. 
PETER (cont'd) They're all coming in now. 
SAM ROGERS Yes they are. 
JARED COHEN I'm sorry... 
SETH This is all I've ever wanted to do. 
JARED COHEN Really? 
SETH Yes... 
This hits JARED just a touch. 
JARED COHEN I am sorry. 
JARED does up his tie perfectly looks at SETH again in the eye. Then walks out. 
INT. EXECUTIVE QUARANTINE ROOM - DAY 
SARAH ROBERTSON is sitting in a club chair staring out the window. The coffee table in front of her has a huge spread of fruit and cheese and pastries. She is not eating. She sits and stares. Eventually the door behind her opens, and a SECURITY GUY walks in with ERIC. 
SECURITY GUY They are almost ready for you Ms. Robertson. Couple of minutes. 
SECURITY GUY leaves the room. ERIC looks over at SARAH then sits in the chair near her. Silence. 
(CONTINUED) 66   CONTINUED:                                                    66 
ERIC You as well? 
SARAH ROBERTSON Yes. 
ERIC Jesus. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Yeah. 
ERIC I'm sorry. 
SARAH ROBERTSON Thank you... Sam and the rest of your floor are gone after today as well. 
ERIC Really... and Cohen? 
SARAH ROBERTSON No... still here. 
ERIC Of course... 
Long awkward pause. Eric looks around for something, anything to talk about. 
ERIC (cont'd) Are you still dating that tall guy... from the Christmas thing? 
She looks over at him with a slight smile, giving him credit for trying to break the ice. 
SARAH ROBERTSON No. 
ERIC He was very tall. 
SARAH ROBERTSON 
ERIC (quietly) Wow. 
Silence. 
(CONTINUED) 66   CONTINUED: (2)                                                66 
SARAH ROBERTSON I did pass on your concerns last year... just so you know. 
ERIC It doesn't matter. 
SARAH ROBERTSON It does. 
The door swings open and a catering person comes in rolling a cart with another large tray with more food on it. She places it on the table next to the other food. The abundance is overwhelming. 
SARAH ROBERTSON (cont'd) Thank you. 
The caterer leaves. ERIC looks around. 
ERIC Have they taken all the phones out of this room? 
SARAH nods yes. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
INT. TRADING FLOOR- 8:20 AM 
There is a very quiet energy on the floor. A low murmur. Then a hush falls over the floor as people pass on the info that the CEO, JOHN TULD is about to come onto the floor. He appears at one end of the floor and it falls silent. JOHN walks dramatically into the middle of the floor and then into the middle of the row in the dead middle of the floor. He looks around and stands in letting the drama build. Then he climbs up onto the desk and looks out onto the floor like a general. 
JOHN TULD By the end of today almost everyone else in the world, including me, will have considerably less money than they began the day with..... You, in this room, are the exception. You will leave here today richer. You will fire the first shot, I wish it didn't have to be, but at times the market must eat its weak, and you all... are not the weak. We must strike quick, with no doubt, if you hear pause on the line, attack. By noon the SEC is going to be in here getting in your faces, sniffing around, you let us take care of them and you just keep going. We own what we are choosing to sell today and there is nothing they can do about it. 107 years ago this firm was founded, today we secure our place for next 107. You've got two minutes before we get started. Let's finish this, so we can get on to the next one... 
JOHN TULD climbs down from the table. SAM, who is standing off to the side, walks along the entire floor slowly and then heads into his office. 
INT. SAM ROGER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
He shuts his door as the bell rings and his office goes almost silent. Through the glass you see the trading floor go wild, then he walks over to his desk, turns around and stares into the four large computer screens as the charts and graphs begin to move. We just see the back of his head. 
INT. INVESTMENT BANK TRADING FLOOR - DAY 
Several actual individual trading sequences throughout the day. 
INT. SAM ROGER'S OFFICE - 4:02 PM 
The market has closed. SAM sits, staring at his computers. There is a knock on his door. He turns and as it opens we hear the sober beginnings of a quiet celebration. He looks up and JARED COHEN is standing in his doorway. 
JARED COHEN Well done. 
SAM ROGERS They did alright. 
JARED COHEN I wanted to give you a heads up. They are going to start sending some people home out here. 
SAM ROGERS Now? 
JARED COHEN (He nods yes) Sorry. No loose ends. 
SAM ROGERS Of course. 
JARED COHEN For what it's worth, you're good... Guess somebody upstairs must really like you. 
SAM stands up and walks past JARED without another word. 
INT. TRADING FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY 
He heads down the hallway and passes the HEATHER and LAUREN BRATBERG from the opening scene who are returning with boxes to lay off more people. SAM heads off towards the elevator. 
INT. SENIOR EXECUTIVE DINING ROOM    - MOMENTS LATER 
The room has ten tables formally set that line a long wall of floor to ceiling windows with a commanding view of the city beyond. The room is empty except for JOHN TULD sitting at the last table. TULD looks a little surprised to see SAM but waves him down. SAM approaches. 
JOHN TULD Sam, please sit. Congratulations are clearly in order. 
SAM ROGERS Our guys did what they could. 
(CONTINUED) 73   CONTINUED:                                                       73 
JOHN TULD You did a hell of a job today, and I thank you for it. Sit, excuse me for eating but it's been a long day. Can I get you anything? 
SAM ROGERS No, no thanks. 
They just sit in silence for a long beat as TULD takes a few more bites of his meal. 
TULD So what can I do for you? 
SAM ROGERS I want out. 
TULD I'm sorry? 
SAM ROGERS I'm done, I want out. 
TULD It's been a very difficult day, for everyone. 
SAM ROGERS I need you to release my options, that is if they're still worth anything after today, and I need the bonus. I'm out. 
TULD You'll get the bonus, the options, and keep your current base, but I need you to stay with me for another 24 months. O.K? 
They look at each other, SAM seems to know it's not actually a question. SAM is a shell of himself as TULD takes another hearty bite of his meal. He finally looks up. 
TULD (cont'd) For God's sake man put a smile on your face, you did some good today, you said so yourself. I'm starting to feel a little better about this whole thing. You're one of the luckiest guys in the world, you could've been digging ditches all these years...

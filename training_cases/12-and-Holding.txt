JIM I already told you, Gabe, I'm not selling that land. Not 30 acres not five. 
GABE I'm willing to pay top dollar. 
JIM I'm not gonna let you tear down those woods, so you can stack twenty houses right on top of each other. 
GABE I'm gonna write down a number. 
JIM No! My kids... hell, your kids play in those woods all the time. You can't put a price on that. 
Gabe writes down a number and hands it to Jim. 
GABE I believe I can. 
Jim looks at the figure and his eyes go wide. 
EXT. STREET - LATER 
A line of PICNIC TABLES surround nearby GRILLS. Leonard's family minus Leonard sit, eating as if there's no tomorrow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SOCCER MOM # 1 (O.S.) Look at them. So unhealthy. 
ON TWO SOCCER MOMS, watching Leonard's family eat. 
SOCCER MOM # 1 (cont'd) You know, Grace can barely walk because of her weight. 
SOCCER MOM # 2 Where do you think she finds clothes big enough to fit? 
The two woman walk off. As they disperse, we see LEONARD, standing behind them. He has heard every word. 
Hurt, Leonard looks down at his own plate, which overflows with food. He feels embarrassed and disgusted. 
Patrick rises and crosses over to the buffet table. 
PATRICK Good eating, huh son? 
Patrick grabs the ladle and begins to fill up his plate. 
LEONARD Maybe you shouldn't have seconds, Dad, you know? 
PATRICK Who are you, Richard Simmons? C'mon, enjoy the day. 
He walks off with his food. Leanard looks down at the food, shrugs, then helps himself to a heaping porion. 
EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE STREET - DUSK 
RUDY straddles his bike while watching a group of 8-year- olds, having a water balloon fight. Jealous, he reminiscences to a time when he was one of those kids. 
KENNY (o.s. ) Me and Jeff are gonna pay that tree house of yours a little visit tonight. 
Rudy spins around to find Kenny, standing at his side. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KENNY (cont'd) When we're through, it'll be a pile of scrap. 
RUDY Why don't you take your smelly ass back to the trailer park? 
KENNY Free country, asshole. 
RUDY You got nothing better to do than pick on us all the time? 
KENNY I did until yesterday. 
RUDY I thought you liked "golden showers". Oh no, that was your mother. 
Kenny pushes Rudy to the ground and then jumps on top of him. Rudy struggles to get free, but he's overpowered. A crowd of kids surround them, chanting, "FIGHT, FIGHT". 
Jeff hocks a phlegm wad onto Rudy's face. Rudy screams as the stream of saliva, drips across his nose and onto his lip. 
NEIGHBORHOOD FATHER (O.S.) What's going on over there? 
Kenny looks up and sees a neighborhood parent coming over. 
KENNY I'll finish this tonight! 
Kenny pushes Rudy down once more and runs off.      Rudy slowly rises, wiping the saliva from his face. 
CONTINUED: 
LEONARD (re: snack cakes) Some provisions. 
RUDY We're only gonna be here a couple of hours. 
LEONARD When two o'clock rolls around, you'll be begging for one of these. 
Rudy shakes his head, removes his BAT from his backpack. 
LEONARD (cont'd) (re: baseball bat) I didn't bring my glove. 
RUDY Moron, the bat is for Jeff and Kenny. You know, to scare them a little. 
He swings it hard. 
RUDY (cont'd) Maybe it's best if we don't talk. Just listen. Listen for them, and don't fall asleep. 
LEONARD I'm wide awake. I could stay up all night. 
EST. EXT. WOODS - LATER THAT NIGHT 
The treehouse is illuminated by the full moon, which rests in the sky above. The thunderous sound of a million crickets fills the air. 
INT. TREEHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Both boys lie asleep. A mosquito flies in through the window and buzzes past Leonard's ear. He haphazardly swipes at it in his sleep, wakes himself up. 
LEONARD Oh, shit. 
Rudy jumps awake. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RUDY What... What is it?    They here? 
LEONARD No. 
Leonard rises, picks up his bag and opens the TRAP DOOR in the floor. He is about to exit. 
RUDY Where you going? 
LEONARD They're not gonna show up, I'm goin' home. It's three o'clock- 
Suddenly, a FLAMING COCKTAIL comes flying through the window. It hits Rudy in the head, explodes and engulfs him in flames. 
EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME 
Jeff and Kenny stand a few yards away from the treehouse. Both laugh at the sight of the flames inside. 
KENNY Now yours.     And aim for the window. 
Jeff lights his COCKTAIL. It misses the window and smashes into the side of the tree house. 
KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Ha ha, you suck. 
Jeff and Kenny hear Leonard and Rudy screaming from inside. 
JEFF You hear that? 
INT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME 
Rudy, now covered in flames, rolls on the floor, screaming. 
RUDY Put it out! Put it out! 
Leonard struggles to put out the flames with his backpack, but it's of no use. He spins around and finds the wall behind him, engulfed with flames. He screams, terrified. 
EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME 
Jeff and Kenny are frantic. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JEFF They're in there!   They're in there! 
Jeff turns around and runs back home through the woods. 
INT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME 
Yacco crosses to Malee and sits beside her. 
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd) So, how was it? 
MALEE It was a funeral, Mom.     How do you think it was? 
YACCO I'm sorry I couldn't make it. Let Rudy's parents know I'm available if they need to talk. I won't charge for the sessions. 
Malee looks to Yacco, stunned by her comment. 
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd) You know, it's okay to cry. 
MALEE I know it's okay to cry. I don't need you to tell me, it's okay to cry. If I want to cry, I'll cry. 
YACCO Okay. 
Yacco re-enters her office.       A beat. 
(CONTINUED)

Malee starts to cry.

Cars fill the driveway and line the street in front of Jacob's house. 
INT. TWIN'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 
Mourners stand in small groups, engaged in hushed conversations. Jim sits in his recliner, crying. 
INT. TWIN'S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
A number of MOTHERS watch as Ashley obsessively prepares a platter of deviled eggs. Concerned, one of them crosses over to her. 
MOTHER Ashley, there's more than enough food here. 
ASHLEY No, Rudy loved my deviled eggs. It's right that I make them. Where's the paprika? 
Ashley opens up her cupboards in search of the paprika. 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Jesus, you put something down, and it disappears. 
Now angry, Ashley starts throwing objects out of the cupboards, haphazardly. 
MOTHER # 1 Ashley. 
Ashley slams her cupboard doors shut. She looks around and spots the GARBAGE PAIL across the kitchen. 
ASHLEY Maybe I threw it out. 
Ashley crosses to the garbage. She lifts it upside down and dumps the trash all over the floor. Ashley gets on her knees and starts searching. 
The other women look to each other, uncomfortable.     Mother # 1 kneels down beside her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MOTHER # 1 Ashley. 
Ashley ignores her. Mother # 1 grabs Ashley's hands and looks her in the eye. 
ASHLEY It's okay. 
Ashley stops cold.     The grief and heartache hit once again. 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) (cont'd) Not my baby! Please God not my son! 
The mothers collectively drop to the floor and surround Ashley in an attempt to comfort her. They give no care to the pile of garbage they now sit in. 
INT. LEONARD'S HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER THAT DAY 
Leonard lies in a bed, staring out the window. There is a BANDAGE wrapped around his forehead. Patrick sits beside him in a chair. 
Grace enters, carrying bags of MCDONALD'S food with her. 
GRACE This hospital is a nightmare. The elevator is never there when you need it. 
Patrick crosses over to the food and grabs his lunch. 
PATRICK Where are the girls? 
LEONARD It feels gross. Like there's a film on my tongue. 
The nurse grabs the tray of food. She removes an untouched apple and places it in Leonard's hand. 
LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd) I don't like apples. 
NURSE So, you can't taste it, right? Maybe you'll like the crunch. 
The nurse exits. Leonard eyes the apple in his hand. A beat. He reluctantly takes a bite. The apple makes a loud CRUNCH. Leonard starts chewing. After a few seconds, a smile comes to his face. He likes it. 
INT. JACOB'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Jacob lies in bed, holding Rudy's old baseball GLOVE. He brings the glove to his nose, and a flood of old memories come back to him. 
Jacob rises, crosses over to the closet and removes a metal LOCK BOX. He selects 666 for the combination and the box opens. Jacob removes the contents; baseball cards, some firecrackers, a few ticket stubs and a PHOTOGRAPH of he and Rudy at age 5. He can't help but smile. 
INT. JACOB'S HOME - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME 
Gabe Artunian crosses over to Jim. 
GABE I'm leaving, Jim.    Again, so sorry. 
As Gabe turns to leave. 
JIM Gabe, are you still interested in buying the land? Because I accept your offer. 
GABE This is hardly the time to talk business. 
JIM Buy the woods, Gabe, please. Tear them down and build. Build houses, condos, a 7-11, I don't care. I just don't want to recognize it ever again.

SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. WOODS - THREE WEEKS LATER -AFTERNOON 
TIGHT ON a CHAIN SAW chopping down a tree. 
WIDEN to REVEAL a CONSTRUCTION CREW, tearing down the last of the woods. Rows and rows of STUMPS make it look like a graveyard for trees. 
MALEE (O.S.) It's gone!     It's all gone! 
We FIND Malee and Jacob, straddling their bikes a few feet away from the site. Leonard is beside them on a scooter. He as a band-aid on his forehead. 
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) If Rudy was alive, he'd be freaking out right now. 
Leonard shoots Malee a look.    She silences herself. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LEONARD You holding up alright, Jacob? 
Jacob shrugs. 
LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd) I'm sorry. I wish I could have done something. 
JACOB Jeff and Kenny were the ones that started the fire. It was their fault. Or maybe mine. I should of been there. 
MALEE You wouldn't have been able to do anything. And it could have been you who died. 
JACOB I wish it was. You know the last thing Rudy said to me? He said, I can't be a pussy all my life. He was right, I am. And Rudy might be dead because of it. 
MALEE Don't say that. (beat) Why don't you talk to your parents about this? 
JACOB They can't help me. 
MALEE Give them time. It'll get better. 
JACOB What if it doesn't? My dad hasn't gone back to work yet. What if he loses his job. We could lose our house. I could be homeless. 
MALEE Then you'll stay with me. 
LEONARD Or me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JACOB We're best friends.    We... 
TEACHER How do you know? 
JACOB Cause he's dead. 
TEACHER I realize being new at this school puts me at a disadvantage, but joking about a fellow classmate's death is anything but funny, Mr.... 
The teacher checks her attendance sheet. 
TEACHER (cont'd) ...Carges.     Wait, are you... 
JACOB I'm his brother. Was.     And I'm not joking. He's dead. 
The teacher looks around at the other students, realizing Jacob is telling the truth. 
TEACHER I'm so sorry. Wow, this is awkward. Would you like the seat left empty? 
JACOB Why? 
TEACHER In memory. 
Off Jacob's look - 
INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - LATER THAT DAY 
COACH GILMORE (55), overweight, gym teacher, dressed in a jogging suit, snaps gum while addressing his students. 
The class of boys stand up against the wall.    Leonard is amongst them. His gym uniform barely fits. 
COACH Alright, ladies, welcome to gym. We will be starting things off this year with the United States Standardized Fitness Test. 
The entire class groans. 
COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) I'm sure you all remember it from last year. I will be testing you in a number of physical fitness areas. 
As coach speaks, Leonard looks as if he's going to throw up. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
ON CHIN UP BAR - MOMENTS LATER 
A STUDENT performs chin ups with great ease. 
COACH (V.O.) The state's requirement for upper body strength is ten chin ups. 
The student finishes his run with a count of twelve.   He hops off the bar and crosses over to his classmates. 
COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) Leonard, you're up. 
Leonard crosses to the chin-up bar, grabs a hold of it and begins struggling to lift himself up. Unfortunately, he can only manage 1/8th of an inch. Leonard drops off the bar, exhausted. 
COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) What are you doing, let's go! 
LEONARD That was as far as I could pull myself up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A few students laugh.        Coach shakes his head, disgusted. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
ON A STUDENT DOING SITUPS - LATER 
Coach stands over the boy, timing him with a stop watch. 
COACH Ten seconds. You need forty to pass. 
The student increases his speed. 
COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) Time.   42.     Good job. 
The student rises off the mat and walks over to the other boys. Leonard enters frame and drops on the mat like a ton of bricks. 
COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) (rolling his eyes) Go! 
Leonard struggles to lift himself up but, he can't do it. 
COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd) Come on, son, fight it. 
Leonard's face turns red. He clenches his teeth. Unfortunately, due to the pressure he is exerting, he blows a loud fart. The gym erupts with laughter. 
EXT. SCHOOL GROUNDS - TRACK - LATER 
ASHLEY No, they're wrong.    Call them back. 
JIM Ashley, I talked to the lawyer.   He wouldn't lie. 
JACOB What's going on? 
ASHLEY This is all your fault. 
JIM Me? 
ASHLEY If we had gone to the hearings like I said, this wouldn't be happening. 
JIM We agreed it would be too painful. 
ASHLEY You agreed. 
JACOB Mom, what happened? 
Ashley turns to Jacob as if realizing his presence for the first time. 
ASHLEY Tell him.    Tell your son. 
JIM The boys who killed Rudy cut a deal. They got a year in juvinile hall and five years probation. 
ASHLEY A year. That's what your brother's life is worth. A damn year! 
JIM Ashley, calm down! 
ASHLEY How can you be so unaffected by this! How? Our son was murdered! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JIM (measured) It was an accident, and the boys are juveniles. 
ASHLEY So that makes it okay? 
Ashley storms out of the room. Jacob looks to his father, unnerved by the sight of his mother so upset. 
Jim just turns and walks into the living room.

FADE IN: 
INT. LEONARD'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING 
Leonard awakens and silences the alarm.   He sits up in bed for a moment and comes to his senses. 
EXT. LEONARD'S HOME - MOMENTS LATER 
Dressed in a sweat suit and sneakers, Leonard sprints down the driveway and to the street. His sweat suit is so tight, Leonard looks like a stuffed sausage. 
With each step he takes, Leonard breathing becomes heavier and heavier. Sweat forms on his forehead and drips down his face. 
Within seconds, Leonard's pace tapers off. He struggles to continue but is so out of shape, stopping is inevitable. 
Leonard leans over, gasping for air. He looks back and realizes that he only ran about one hundred yards. In fact, his house is still in view. 
Leonard turns around and starts walking back home.    After a few steps, he stops and throws up. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAYS LATER - AFTERNOON 
Gus stands inside of a shallow ditch, digging out the roots of an old tree.

GUS Dr. Chung's daughter. 
MALEE You remembered. We were never introduced. My name is Malee. 
GUS Gus. 
They shake hands. 
CONTINUED: 
Malee closes her book, looks over at Leanord. 
LEONARD I can't believe it either. A year ain't shit! Rudy is dead forever. 
JACOB I want them dead. I want to kill them. I could handle a year in Juvy hall. 
MALEE Whoa, what those guys did was an accident. If you were to kill them, it's premedicated. You'd get 20 years to life at least. 
JACOB So I'm just supposed to sit here and take it? Be like you guys. 
LEONARD What is that supposed to mean? 
JACOB You seem to have gone on with life pretty easily. Don't you miss him? Don't you care? 
MALEE It's not that we don't care.     It's just... 
JACOB Life goes on. 
MALEE It does. You have to deal with it. If you don't, it could like eat you alive forever. 90 percent of people's problems is due to their inability to get over the past. 
LEONARD How do you know? 
MALEE My mom tells that to all her patients. I've eavesdropped on some of her therapy sessions. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LEONARD That's awesome. Can I listen in sometime? 
MALEE No. Anyway, she says, if a person wants closure, they gotta deal with their problems head on. Go see these guys and let them know how you feel. 
JACOB I don't think my parents would be up for that. 
MALEE Go alone. Juvy hall is only like forty minutes from here. Take the bus. 
Off Jacob, thinking- 
INT. JACOB'S PARENT'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT AFTERNOON 
The bedroom door slowly opens. Jacob peeks his head inside the darkened room and quietly enters. He tip toes over to his parent's bed. Ashley lies asleep, wrapped up in a bundle of blankets. 
Jacob crosses to her night stand and opens the top drawer. He removes her purse, unzips it and steals some cash, which totals around 60 dollars. 
INT. CARGES LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Jim sits in his chair, staring off into space.   Jacob enters and crosses to the front door. 
JACOB Bye, Dad. 
EXT. BUS STATION - MOMENTS LATER

Jacob and Kenny sit, staring at each other through a plate of glass. Kenny picks up the ONE WAY PHONE. Jacob does also. 
JACOB Where's Jeff? 
KENNY He's sick.     I think he... 
JACOB (interrupting) I hate you. You know that?     You bastard. 
KENNY Rudy knew we were going to be there. He never should have come. You want the truth, all this happened cause of you. 
JACOB Me? 
KENNY Yeah, you deformed retard! The only reason we started picking on you guys in the first place was because of that thing on your face. 
JACOB Every night, I lie in bed and plan your murder. 
KENNY I'm shaking. 
JACOB First I'm going to take a kitchen knife and chop off your fingers then your nose then your tongue. Then I'm gonna poke out your eyes with the end of a broomstick. Well, not really poke them out, but I'm gonna push them back into your brain. Then I'm gonna take scissors and cut off your ears. When they find you, it's gonna be like putting a jigsaw puzzle back together.

Jim stands on a chair, cleaning out the kitchen cupboards. 
Pots and pans line the counter tops, dishes cover the table and non perishable foods are spread out across the floor. 
Jacob enters and is taken aback by the sight of Jim standing on a chair and wearing an APRON and RUBBER GLOVES. 
JACOB Dad? 
JIM Jacob. 
JACOB You okay? 
JIM Fantastic. 
Jim rips the rubber gloves off with his teeth. 
JIM (CONT'D) (cont'd) You know, for the past few weeks, I sat in this house. I couldn't move. Everything reminded me of Rudy. Then from out of nowhere I had a revelation. I am alive! Your mother is alive! I became overcome with joy because I realized how lucky we are to still have you. 
JACOB Me? 
JIM Jacob.   I love you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Jim grabs Jacob and hugs him tightly.    Jacob pulls away, unsettled and bit frightened. 
JIM (CONT'D) (cont'd) (half crazed) I went to work today. For the first time in weeks. It was as if I had just gotten out of college! I was fearless! I went after accounts I had avoided for years because I thought they were out of my league. I spoke to presidents, vice presidents, business managers, sales reps. I was amazing. I was magic. But when I came home to share the news with your mother, I discovered her asleep. When I looked around the house, I realized that her "office", for lack of a better word, was also piled up. So, I took to the house. I have made it my duty to clean this place from top to bottom. Even if it takes me all night, I don't care. Jacob? 
JACOB (frightened) Yeah? 
JIM Will you join me? Join me in this celebration of life. A symbolic gesture of cleaning out the old and bringing in the new. 
JACOB Do I have to? 
JIM (thrown for a loop) No, you don't have to. 
JACOB Good night, Dad.

Parents and students file inside. A large SIGN above the door reads, JEFFERSON JUNIOR HIGH FALL RECITAL. 
INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS 
A packed audience listens to A GIRL (12), standing center stage and singing "The Rose". She is not nearly as good as she thinks she is, but she sings full throttle. 
We FIND Malee, sitting in the flute section and playing along with the rest of the orchestra. She looks to the front row, but Gus is no where to be found. 
The girl finishes her song, and the crowd politely applauds. 
Mr. Farmer crosses to the microphone. 
MR. FARMER I'm sure Bette Midler would be most impressed with that rendition. 
The crowd laughs.   Mr. Farmer didn't mean for it to be a joke. 
PATRICK What's your point? 
LEONARD Dad, you and mom are going to die young if you keep eating as poorly as you do. 
PATRICK What is this obsession you have with weight? 
LEONARD The coach for Jefferson High is also my gym teacher. He told me that if I got into shape, I could start as center for the Freshman team when I get to high school. 
PATRICK Center is a great position. Toughest guy on the field. A good center can make or break a team. 
LEONARD I know.   That's why I'm trying so hard to get into shape. You guys should to. At the rate you're going, you won't make it to your 60's. 
PATRICK Look, Leonard. Your mom, to her, a tasty meal is just a way of showing she cares. 
LEONARD She doesn't! Tonight she served spaghetti and meatballs from a can. The amount of sodium alone can wreck havoc on a person's blood pressure. Not to mention... 
PATRICK Leonard, people just don't drop dead from eating meatballs. 
Off Leonard's look - 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAYS LATER - AFTERNOON 
Malee hands Gus her bag of Halloween Candy.

GUS I can't take your Halloween candy. 
MALEE You'll be doing me a favor. Chocolate gives you zits. Besides, if I want to keep this firm ass as an adult, I gotta develop good eating habits now. 
GUS (uncomfortable) Maybe just a snickers. 
Gus opens a snickers bar and starts eating. 
MALEE So work is good? 
GUS To be honest, I can't wait till this job is finished. This place is creepy. You know, a boy died here like right before we started working. 
MALEE Rudy.   His name was Rudy. 
GUS You knew him? 
MALEE He was one of my best friends. Remember that funeral I went to? 
GUS That was him? 
MALEE I thought you knew. Two boys threw a flaming cocktail at him. Can you imagine killing someone like that? How evil can you get? 
Gus eyes Malee, completely unsettled.

Obviously drunk, Gus stumbles to his front door.   He fumbles for his keys and enters. 
INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER 
Gus lies in bed with a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a GUN in the other. Distraught and at the point of tears, Gus opens the chamber and loads the gun with a single bullet. 
Then he spins the chamber and locks it. Gus puts the gun to his head and fires. NOTHING. He throws the gun across the room, grabs the bottle of whiskey and drinks it till it's gone. 
INT. JACOB'S HOME - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING 
Ashley stands with a big smile on her face. 
ASHLEY Jeff Laskey is dead. 
Jim and Jacob look up, stunned. 
JIM What? 
ASHLEY He committed suicide in his jail cell last night. Sally Yngve called just now to tell me. 
Jim and Jacob sit, stunned. Their shock turns to intrigue as Ashley, appearing unaffected by the news, crosses to the kitchen table, opens a nearby box of donuts and begins eating. She is smiling. 
JACOB Why are you smiling?    A boy died. 
ASHLEY No, a monster that murdered my son died. Justice is served; end of story. 
Ashley crosses to the kitchen sink. She rolls up her sleeves and begins cleaning. Jim crosses over to her and they kiss as if nothing happened. Jacob is baffled by their behavior. 
INT. JUVY HALL - COMMUNICATION BOOTH - LATER THAT NIGHT 
MALEE Why do I have to do this? It's Christmas break. 
YACCO You'll be one step ahead in January. 
MALEE Just because you're an atheist, I don't get to celebrate the holidays. 
Yacco shoots Malee the look of death. 
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Don't you find it hard not believing in anything? 
YACCO Malee. 
MALEE I'm going for a bike ride. 
YACCO There's a foot of snow outside. 
MALEE The streets are ploughed. Besides, I like looking at all the lights.

INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Malee cautiously enters, shutting the door behind her. A beat. She allows the excitement to settle in. It's your typical bachelor pad. Stray beer bottles decorate every shelf and end table. Dirty clothes drape across an old couch. Malee continues on to the kitchen. 
INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Malee finds the kitchen more of a mess than the living room. Pots, pans and stacks of TV dinners line the counter top. 
INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Malee enters and stops cold at the sight of the bed. Its unmade and the sheets and blankets are entangled in a ball. Aroused, Malee sits on the bed and then lies back in ecstacy.

Gus drives up, parks along the sidewalk, and gets out. 
INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

TIGHT ON TRIGGER, a hair away from firing -

INT. GUS' APARTMENT - FRONT DOOR - SAME TIME 
The loud bang we heard was the front door slamming shut.   Gus opens it and inspects the door frame. 
INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN/BEDROOM - SECONDS LATER 
Gus removes a beer from the fridge. We follow him into his bedroom. He stops cold as if feeling the presence of some one else there, but Malee is nowhere to be found. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
MALEE My mother is a total snoop. She goes through my stuff like all the time. (beat) Please, Jacob. Somebody's life might depend on it. 
Jacob crosses to his closet, removes his metal LOCK BOX and opens it. Jacob takes the gun and places it inside. 
JACOB Is it loaded? 
MALEE No, but I do have some bullets. 
Malee reaches into her backpack and removes the bullets. Jacob takes them out and puts them in the lock box. 
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Sure your parents won't find it? 
JACOB Nobody has the combination, but me. Besides, I could be building a bomb in here, and they wouldn't even know. 
Off Jacob, locking the box up. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE IN: 
EXT. STREET - MONTHS LATER - MORNING 
ON TWO FEET, running. We REVEAL that it's LEONARD. His once skin tight sweat suit, hangs off of him. More than just skinny, Leonard is in perfect shape. He runs fast, carefully avoiding puddles of melting snow. (Spring is fast on the horizon.) 
INT. JUVY HALL - CONVERSATION BOOTH - NEXT DAY 
Jacob and Kenny talk via one way phone. Their demeanor has changed since last we saw them. No longer fraught with contempt and acrimony, they speak like two old friends. 
JACOB I sent in some comics for ya.   The X-men one is pretty sweet. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KENNY That last batch was awesome. 
Jacob checks his watch. 
JACOB I better get going, I don't want to miss my bus. 
KENNY Before you go, I got some news. Apparently, the parole board feels I've been a model prisoner, so they're giving me early release. 
JACOB What?   How can they do that? 
KENNY I don't know. They just did. You're pissed, aren't you? I knew you would be. (off Jacob's silence) It was an accident, Jacob. 
JACOB So you're getting out.   Gonna head back to school, or... 
KENNY Fuck school. I'm going to live with my Dad in New Mexico. He's working on a ranch out there. 
JACOB You can't leave the state. That violates your probation. You'll have to... 
KENNY My dad won't tell anyone. No one will even care I'm out there. 
JACOB Your mom will. 
KENNY Jacob, in the entire time I've been locked up, you were the only one who came to see me. Trust me, she won't care. 
INT. MALEE'S HOME - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON 
Malee fans out a fist full of twenty dollar bills. 
MALEE 200 dollars! Dad sent me 200 dollars! 
Yacco, smiling, gets ready for work. 
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) I have to call him. 
YACCO No! (covering) Your father... went out.     He's not home right now. 
Malee eyes her mother, suspicious. 
MALEE You're acting weird.     What's going on? 
YACCO Nothing. 
MALEE Well, do you want to come with me to the mall and spend it? 
YACCO I'd prefer it if you'd put that money in the bank. (off Malee's look) Fine, spend it. You'll have to do it alone though. I have a patient this afternoon. Have a good day. 
YACCO Malee, dinner! 
Yacco notices a number of department store bags strewn everywhere. 
YACCO (cont'd) Malee? (noticing something) Oh my God! 
REVEAL MALEE, standing across the room. She is no longer the gawky, adolescent girl. Rather, she has been transformed into a beautiful young woman. Her glasses have been replaced by contacts, and her braided pig tails by a quaff of chin length curls. 
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd) What did you do? 
MALEE I got a new look. You know, for Spring. What do you think? 
Malee spins around, giving Yacco the full picture. 
YACCO You look... 
MALEE Beautiful? 
YACCO Different. What happened to your glasses? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MALEE Contacts. It took me like forty five minutes to get them in, but beauty is pain. 
YACCO Honey, in the future, I'd like to know if you're going to radically change your appearance. Clean your stuff up and come down for dinner. 
Yacco exits.    Malee looks in the mirror, deflated. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - AFTERNOON 
Gus watches a CEMENT TRUCK, dumping cement into a foundation. Once the cement is poured, the truck pulls forward. Malee is revealed, standing there and holding a picnic basket. 
Gus sees the new and improved Malee for the first time.      His jaw drops. 
GUS Malee?   My God, you look... 
MALEE Different? 
GUS Beautiful.     You look beautiful. 
Off Malee's smile - 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - ANOTHER AREA - LATER 
Gus and Malee eat their lunch. 
MALEE I felt like I needed a change, you know? 
GUS I bet you're driving the boys at school wild. 
MALEE Boys my age are so immature. I'm more attracted to older gentlemen. 
Malee smiles at Gus.       He knows where this is going, and he's suddenly nervous. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GUS You don't want somebody that much older than you. An age difference can cause problems. 
MALEE What kind of problems? 
GUS A lot of times when a couple has an age difference, they wind up splitting up because they want different things. 
MALEE You mean sex. 
GUS No. 
Gus catches a look of relief on Malee's face. 
GUS (cont'd) I mean, yeah. You may be 13, but a boy even three years older than you is probably more "experienced". Boys can be impatient about that sort of thing. 
MALEE Are you impatient? 
GUS No, but when I was a kid. 
MALEE Why don't you have a girlfriend? 
GUS I did, but it didn't work out. 
MALEE How old was she? 
Off Keith's hurt look - 
INT. LIBRARY - LATER 
Malee stands at the card catalogue, flipping through the "S" section. She comes to cards with the word SEX in the title. 
INT. MALEE'S HOME - BEDROOM - EARLY EVENING 
Malee enters her room, locks the door behind her and empties her bag of SEX books on the bed. The first one she peruses is the "KARMA SUTRA". At first glance, Malee's eyes go wide in shock. She grabs her backpack and removes a number of index cards. Malee starts taking notes. 
INT. JUVY HALL - COMMUNICATION BOOTHS - NEXT DAY 
Jacob is on the one way phone with Kenny. 
JACOB He's not some baby.   He's like 10. 
KENNY You're blaming me for this? 
JACOB No.   But can you believe it? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
KENNY Maybe this is the only way they can get over Rudy's death. 
JACOB He's a person not a fucking vase. 
KENNY I know. 
JACOB I gotta get out of there. I can't live in that house for one more day. I want to go with you to New Mexico. 
KENNY No way. You've never even   been out on the road. 
JACOB So. 
KENNY It's not easy. After first night falls, you'll be pissing yourself. 
JACOB No, I won't. 
KENNY You don't need me to run away from home. 
JACOB That's not what this is about. 
KENNY Yes, it is. (beat) And you want to come with ME of all people. Are you forgetting, I was the one who killed Rudy! 
JACOB That was an accident. 
Kenny appears stunned.    Jacob has never accepted that truth. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd) I'll be helpful. I can get everything we'll need together. As soon as you're released, we can go. 
Kenny appears to be weighing the decision. 
JACOB (CONT'D) (cont'd) Please. 
KENNY If this is what you want.   Alright. 
INT. MALEE'S HOME - KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
Yacco is on the phone with her ex-husband. 
YACCO (INTO PHONE) ... I'm not asking for much. Just call her from time to time... Because she needs to know her father cares... Call collect. 
Malee enters the kitchen. 
MALEE Is that Dad? Can I talk to him? 
YACCO Take some responsibility for yourself and grow... Hello?... 
Yacco slams the phone down. 
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd) He hung up. 
MALEE Well, what do you expect?   All you ever do is yell at him. 
YACCO Malee, you don't understand. 
MALEE He's my Dad! I'm sorry if it bothers you, but I love him. You keep this up then one day, when I'm old enough, I'll leave here and go and stay with him. 
Leonard descends the staircase, holding a tray of food. 
Grace instantly rises. 
LEONARD I hope someone is hungry. 
GRACE Get me out of here now! 
LEONARD No joke, Ma. For the next two weeks while Dad and the girls are away, you will be kept down here. I'll provide you with nutritious meals and plenty of water. You, mother, will learn what it means to be healthy. 
GRACE That's what this is about, food? 
LEONARD I'm trying to save your life, mom. Trying to give you a life. Cause I love you. 
GRACE My life is fine.   I don't need you to "save me". 
Leonard looks at his mother, sympathetic. 
LEONARD You don't even realize how sick you are. It's a problem when an otherwise healthy woman can't drag her ass up a flight of stairs because she's so obese. You're staying down here. 
Leonard turns and crosses back to the staircase. 
LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd) Oh, and no cigarettes either. 
INT. GUS' APARTMENT - KITCHEN - EVENING 
The kitchen is now spotless. Malee removes TWO TV DINNERS from the oven. She crosses over to the kitchen table and places the food onto plates. 
The table is set to the nines. A small candle burns in the center. Once the table is set and the food served, Malee takes a step back and smiles. 
INT. GUS' APARTMENT - BATHROOM - LATER 
Malee strips off her clothes and puts on a long, silk robe. 
EXT. GUS' APARTMENT BUILDING - SAME TIME 
Gus drives up, gets out of his car and enters the building. 
INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Gus approaches his door. As he takes out his key, he notices that the welcome mat has been pushed off to the side. Gus lifts the mat up and sees that his spare key is gone. 
INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - FRONT ENTRANCE/ KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Gus enters.   He knows someone else is in there. 
GUS Hello? 
We follow him into the kitchen and FIND MALEE, standing beside the table and dressed only in her robe. 
GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd) What the hell is this? 
MALEE I made dinner, my love.   And I have a surprise. 
GUS You've been in my apartment before, haven't you? 
Malee drops her robe, revealing her naked body.    Gus quickly looks away. 
GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd) Malee, put your clothes on now! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MALEE Don't you like my body? 
Malee starts walking towards him. 
GUS Malee, stop. 
MALEE It's okay because I love you. 
Gus doesn't answer. Malee is right behind him now.     She puts her head on his back. 
MALEE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Touch me. 
Gus slowly turns around and looks at Malee for a long, pregnant beat. It's a tense moment, and we are unsure of what he's going to do. Then Gus moves past her and crosses to the living room. 
MALEE (cont'd) Where are you going? 
GUS To go call your mother. 
Gus exits.    Malee stands the fool. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
ASHLEY I know you think we favored Rudy... 
JACOB You did!    Admit it. 
ASHLEY I admit he was easier to raise, but we didn't love him more. Jacob, listen to me. You came with a different set of challenges. 
JACOB My birthmark. 
ASHLEY It's not easy being different... 
JACOB (screams) I'm not different!! You always made me feel like something was wrong. There's nothing wrong with me. 
ASHLEY I know... 
JACOB No, you don't! It's like you don't know how to deal with me. You never did. 
ASHLEY I'm sorry if that is how you feel. You do the best you can as a parent. You don't always know what's right. But you're my son. I'd do anything for you. I'd fight for you, I'd kill for you, I'd die for you. 
JACOB Rudy used to say that exact same thing. 
ASHLEY It's true. And as unchristian as it sounds, I still want the boy that killed Rudy dead. Someday, when you grow up, you'll understand what I mean. Someday. 
INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - SAME TIME 
SFX: TOILET FLUSHING 
Grace exits the bathroom and begins walking around the basement, looking for a way out. She crosses to the boarded up door and tries to pull the boards off. Unsuccessful, she returns to the bed and sits. 
After a beat, Grace spots the tray of food, which is still untouched. Angry and disgusted, she takes it and throws it at the wall. 
CUT TO: 
LATER THAT NIGHT - 
Grace paces nervously while blabbering to herself. 
GRACE When Pat calls, and I don't answer, he'll know something is wrong. He'll know. I'll be fine. 
CUT TO: 
LATER THAT NIGHT - 
Grace nervously rocks back and forth. Sweat covers her body. She glances at the tray of food, which rests on the floor. 
CUT TO: 
LATER THAT NIGHT - 
Grace stands at the base of the stairwell, screaming. 
GRACE Open this door now! Let me out, God damn it! Leonard! 
CUT TO: 
LATER THAT NIGHT - 
Grace is crying. She catches sight of the meal that she threw on the floor. 
After a beat, Grace crawls over to it and starts shoving it down her throat. She doesn't seem bothered by the fact that her dinner is covered with dirt. 
INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - RECEPTION AREA - NEXT DAY - AFTERNOON 
Yacco exits her office to find Gus waiting for his session. They speak not a word. He rises and enters the office. She follows, shutting the door behind her. 
INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Gus and Yacco sit in their respective seats. 
YACCO Before we begin, I want to apologize. I should have known what was going on with Malee. 
GUS It's my fault. I knew she had a crush on me. I guess, I felt bad for her. She's a very unhappy girl. 
Yacco looks down, embarrassed. 
GUS (CONT'D) (cont'd) If it's any consolation, the whole thing was very "therapeutic" for me. (off Yacco's look) Sorry. That was a very selfish thing to say. 
YACCO This is your therapy. Not mine. Why was it therapeutic? 
GUS I slept last night. I can't remember the last time I slept so deep or so sound. I don't remember dreaming or anything. 
Leonard is slumped over, unconscious. 
INT. LEONARD'S HOME - BASEMENT - SAME TIME 
Grace coughs hard. 
GRACE Leonard, don't you smell that...? (sotto) Oh God, he can't. Leonard! Leonard, the gas is on! 
Grace grabs a hold of the railing and starts climbing the stairs. After a few steps, she stops to rest, wheezing. 
With the help of the railing, Grace pulls herself up to the GAP in the staircase. In one forceful exertion, she propels her body up and forward. The railing instantly becomes separated from the wall. Grace lands in a heap. 
Luckily, the top half of her body made it to the other side. With all of her might, Grace pulls herself up to the landing. 
INT. LEONARD'S HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Exhausted and wheezing, Grace drags herself over to the stove and shuts the gas off. She looks around for Leonard and sees him in the living room, slumped over and unconscious. 
GRACE No! 
Grace frantically shuffles over to the living room. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GRACE (CONT'D) (cont'd) Leonard, wake up! Leonard! 
INT. HOSPTIAL ROOM - NIGHT 
Leonard slowly comes to in a hospital bed.       The same nurse from earlier is by his side. 
NURSE It's alive! 
LEONARD What happened? 
NURSE Gas leak. 
LEONARD My mom, she's... 
NURSE She's fine. They've taken her into surgery. She blew out her knees somehow. We're trying to get your father on the phone right now. 
LEONARD I... 
NURSE Shh. You need your rest. Everything is fine now. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY 
Jacob straddles his bike, watching a crew spread cement over the foundation of a house. Jacob appears lost in thought. He looks at a picture of Rudy and himself together. 
Jacob touches his face in the photograph. He traces his finger along the outline of his birthmark. 
KENNY (O.S.) Tonight, we ride. 
EXT. TRAILER PARK - BESIDE KENNY'S TRAILER - DUSK 
Jacob and Kenny share a cigarette. 
KENNY We got sleeping bags, a tent, canteens and a lantern. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: KENNY (cont'd) I heard it's supposed to rain, so I'll bring ponchos. 
JACOB (half hearted) Cool. 
Kenny eyes Jacob. 
KENNY You're acting weird.    You gonna chicken out? 
JACOB No. 
KENNY You better not. I already packed twice the amount of shit. I can't carry it all alone. 
JACOB I'll be there. 
KENNY Good. I'm telling you, man. It's gonna be great. 
JACOB I guess. 
KENNY Come on. You can't be a pussy all your life. 
JACOB (beat, hauntingly) I know. 
KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd) The main road is this way. 
JACOB Yeah, but if we cut through the construction site, we'll hit the railroad tracks. It's faster and no one will bother us. 
KENNY Good point. 
Kenny files in behind Jacob, and the boys make their way deep into the construction site. Thunder and lightning crash. 
INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Keith has forgone opening the lock box via a combination and now tries to pry the top open with a SCREWDRIVER. He works frantically, fearing Jacob's return. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME TIME 
Jacob and Henry make their way to the edge of the construction site. Suddenly, Jacob stops in his tracks. 
KENNY What's wrong? 
Jacob lifts the hockey mask. 
JACOB I can't do this. 
KENNY What?! 
Jacob begins rummaging through his backpack. 
INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Keith pries the box open.       It's EMPTY.   No gun or bullets. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SAME TIME 
KENNY Son of a bitch! I knew it.     I knew you'd chicken... 
Jacob rises, holding the gun.   He points it at Kenny. 
KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd) What the fuck? 
Jacob shakes, frightened and reluctant to do what he believes he has to do. 
JACOB I can't let you leave, Kenny.     You have to pay for what you did. 
KENNY Whoa, whoa hold on. Alright, I... I won't go. I'll stay here. I'll do my probation. 
Jacob cocks the gun.   Tears stream down his checks. 
JACOB You killed him. I gotta do this... for my family. It's the only way. 
KENNY Jacob, I told ya, it... it was an accident. I swear. Please, don't. This isn't you. 
JACOB I know. But I can't be a pussy all my life. 
Jacob fires. Kenny is hit in the head.      He drops to the ground instantly. 
The force of the gun, knocks Jacob to the ground.      As he falls, the hockey mask comes down over his face. 
Jacob sits for a beat, staring at Kenny's lifeless body. Lightning flashes, illuminating his blue eyes through the hockey mask. 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER 
Jacob is inside one of the UNPAVED house foundations, digging a hole. He cries, struggling to finish what he has done. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Once a hole is dug, Jacob throws Kenny's body inside and starts covering it up with dirt. 
INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Jacob climbs through his window, soaking wet. He crosses to his closet and begins to change. Keith lies in bed, watching. 
Jacob removes the gun from his pocket and places it back inside the lock box. His hands shake violently. As he puts the box back inside the closet. He finds Rudy's glove. He smells the leather and smiles. 
Jacob takes the glove and crosses over to his bed.    He places the glove beside Keith. 
KEITH I thought I wasn't supposed to touch this. 
JACOB You're awake. 
KEITH Yeah. 
JACOB It's yours. Just don't leave it outside. If it gets wet, the leather will crack.

"REINDEER GAMES" 
Screenplay by 
Ehren Kruger 
FADE IN: 
FIGURE IN A SANTA CLAUS SUIT 
lies face-down in a nighttime expanse of snow. One of the body's red-sleeved arms is twisted at a sickening angle. The white snow beneath the figure is spreading with red. 
REVEAL EXT. SNOWY ROAD - NIGHT 
The figure in the suit lies motionless. Snowflakes drift. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Dark, rustic wood, an office with broken windows and whistling winter beyond. A second BODY in a Santa Claus suit lies dead in the doorway. 
It's a man with a large build. The suit is riddled with holes. His face is missing. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
More snow falling. A handful of cars in the lot. A third BODY in the same red-and-white outfit lies atop the hood of an old Pontiac. His head is not visible, having smashed through the windshield. His suit is charred and blackened. 
A halo of broken glass outlines him. His black boots hang off the front bumper. The parking lot is silent. 
INT. ROOM - NIGHT 
A floor scattered with shiny silver quarters. Reflections of neon. There's a fourth SANTA here, face-down in a red pool. The suit is far too big for him. Not that it matters now. 
EXT. SNOW-FILLED RAVINE - NIGHT 
where the fifth and final Santa lies at the edge of a ravine, which plummets a hundred feet down. The man rests precariously atop the slope, upside-down, eyes closed. 
His burned suit is smoldering. He has a sly but tired face, late-20's, sandy hair, cold and scarred. This is RUDY DUNCAN. 
He opens his eyes. 
RUDY (V.O.) I never was much for the holidays. 
CUT TO BLACK: 
THE SOUND OF A WINTER WIND 
rises, as a TITLE appears: "SEVEN DAYS BEFORE..." 
And then, to complete the sentence: "...XMAS." 
FADE IN: 
EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN STATE PRISON - DAY 
Snow drifts down onto the stone walls and wire fences of the Iron Mountain, Michigan S.I.C. Winter's been here awhile. 
INT. PRISON CELL - DAY 
Rudy Duncan lies in his top bunk, staring at his ceiling -- where a handful of paper-cut snowflakes have been pasted. 
The sounds of YELLING INMATES and GATES slamming shut echo through the fortress. Rudy watches a spider scurry across the paper snow. It's his excitement for the day. 
He turns to the wall, where there's a photo of his teenage self with some co-workers at an auto body shop. And a family photo, cheery Midwesterners, with Rudy a scowling Artful Dodger. 
A WALL CALENDAR 
Shows the dates have been crossed off up to December 18th. 
December 22nd is circled again and again. 
Rudy muses at the calendar, then hops out of his bunk. Drops to the floor, crosses to a desk, finds a chewed-on pen. Turning back to the beds we reveal -- 
THE LOWER BUNK 
where Rudy's cellmate, NICK MASON (32), rugged, mustached and well-built, sleeps soundly. In contrast, his bed-wall is a COLLAGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS, twenty, maybe thirty of them. Almost a mural. 
All of them photos of A BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL, mid-twenties, smiling out from beaches, parties and snowy scenes. Gorgeous brown hair, heartbreaking smile. Effortlessly sexy. 
RUDY 
stares at the pictures for a moment, wistful. Nick snores, turns over. Rudy climbs atop his bunk again, with the pen this time. And crosses December 18th off the calendar. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY 
The two of them, Nick and Rudy, shivering by the fence. Nick absently whistles some "Silver Bells," then digs for a smoke. 
NICK What's the first thing, man? What's the first thing you're gonna do? 
RUDY Haven't thought about it. 
NICK Hell you haven't. 
RUDY Get to thinking about it, it won't happen. 
NICK We walk outta here, we hit that road, what's the first thing you're gonna do. 
RUDY Ain't there yet. 
NICK Three days, man. 
There's the echo of CRASHING metal gates. Prisoners YELLING. Nick smiles, still staring at his girl. 
NICK Well, man. Me and Ashley. We'll be thinking about you. 
INT. MAIN PRISON FLOOR - DAY 
GUARDS monitor PRISONERS as they file out of their cells for the afternoon meal. Rudy and Nick are motioned out by a MEAN GUARD, his bitter world etched in his face. They join the line. 
RUDY Shit. Alamo's back. 
Across Broadway, a parallel line is forming. A tall, tattooed Native American, THE ALAMO, steps out of his cell. His hands are the size of a man's skull. 
NICK Don't look like he missed the sunlight. 
RUDY Pinscher told me Alamo thinks I'm the one ratted on him beating up Cree. Since I was there, I saw it, he thinks I got him sent to solitary. 
NICK Aw, Rudy. 
At that moment, Alamo glances over. Finds Rudy's eyes. Rudy swiftly looks away -- 
RUDY Count me outta mealtime -- 
He slaps Nick an the back, heads back for their cell -- 
MEAN GUARD GET BACK IN LINE! 
RUDY I'm not hungry, I'm gonna -- 
MEAN GUARD SHOULDA STAYED IN YOUR HOLE! GET BACK IN FUCKING LINE! 
The mean guard pulls his blackjack. Another guard's ready behind him. They want Rudy to give them trouble. 
Rudy stops. Slides back into the line of prisoners. Looks across Broadway. The Alamo's walked on up ahead. Rudy swallows, heads toward the mess hall. 
INT. MESS HALL - DAY 
A GLOOPY SPOON of CHUNKY RED AND GREEN JELLO gets splooshed on Rudy's plate. Same with Nick. It's the cafeteria line. 
NICK What the fuck is this? 
UGLY STAFFER Holiday jello. 
NICK What's this shit in it? 
UGLY STAFFER Swallow and see. 
The ugly staffer grins from under his plastic hairnet. Nick looks to Rudy, then turns back to the help: 
NICK Just so you know, this man and I are outta here in two days. So while we're inhaling London broil and lobster bisque, you're gonna still be standing here smelling up the mystery creamfuck. (nods) Who's in prison now? 
The ugly staffer curls his lip. Nick smiles. Rudy moves on, taking his tray off the rail and turning -- 
-- right into the chest of The Alamo. He looks up -- into the most scarred and vengeful face a man could ever dread to see. The Alamo's a lifer. Many times over. 
THE ALAMO When you don't expect it. 
RUDY It wasn't me, Alamo -- 
THE ALAMO That's when. 
The Alamo strides into the cafeteria line. Rudy finally takes a breath, as if he's dodged death. Nick's at his shoulder. They share a grave and worried look. Trying to help: 
NICK Two days. 
INT. MESS HALL - TABLES - DAY 
Rudy and Nick sit at a cafeteria table. Beside Rudy is a frail, nervous, fiftyish inmate, ZOOK. Zook sits alone, talks to no one, always has the shakes. 
NICK So maybe after our week beneath the sheets, we'll head down to Motor City for New Year's. She says her roommate's skipping town for a few days, have the place to ourselves. Remember how her brother's a truck driver down there? I'm thinking he might be able to help get me some work. 
RUDY What, working security? 
NICK No, I'm through with that shit. Ashley's right. Gotta start doing something I got a stake in. Get a business going. 
RUDY I don't know, I've seen the business world. 
NICK Hotwiring cars, Rudy, does not qualify as a small business. Chop shop consultant; doesn't work on a resume. 
Rudy shrugs. He checks across the room, on the whereabouts of The Alamo. The big Indian has his back turned. 
NICK Ashley's talking about maybe we can start something up together... 
Next to Rudy, Zook has stopped eating. He is still as stone, staring at his tray. 
NICK Whatsa matter, Zook? 
They both watch Zook put down his utensils and reach into his red-and-green jello with his bare hand. 
RUDY The hell you doing, Zookerman? 
Gloppy gelatin drips from his hand, as the frail man lifts a large black cockroach out. Zook's shaking. 
NICK Just a roach, Zook. 
RUDY Good for you. Protein. 
ZOOK Monsters in the gelatin... 
NICK It's a roach, guy -- 
ZOOK There are monsters... (voice rising) ...in the gelatin... 
And the world goes dark. 
INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT 
Darkness and shadows. Rudy sits in a corner, holding his head. The cell block silent for the first time. 
Bootsteps from down the row. A SHADOW falls across Rudy's somber figure. It's the Mean Guard. He stares at Rudy with distinct pleasure. 
RUDY The man had two days... 
MEAN GUARD Well. Least he won't be coming back. 
The guard grins a gold tooth. Rudy looks at him -- 
-- and then springs to his feet, charges the room, grabbing through the bars. The guard takes a calm step back. Keeps the cruel smile. 
MEAN GUARD You need company tonight, Rudy... you just give a holler. 
He puckers a kiss and walks on. Starts whistling "Are You Lonesome Tonight?" Several shadowed VOICES request that he shut the fuck up. The bootsteps and melody drift down the row. 
RUDY 
turns back, starts toward his bunk. And stops. His eyes on Nick's empty bed. And the wall behind. 
THE PICTURES OF ASHLEY 
Smiling, laughing, playing kissy-face. Hearts drawn on the photos. All colors of stationery taped to the wall. 
RUDY 
takes a seat on Nick's bed. There's a shoebox at the foot of it. 
Rudy opens it. It's filled with Ashley's letters. 
He trails a finger along them, must be over a hundred pages. He selects the one nearest the front. Surveys it. 
NICK (V.O.) Rudy, man, here we go, here, what she wrote here: "The car's waiting. The motel's waiting. And I'm waiting. I've waited for so long. I'm burning for you, Nick. My whole body. My whole heart. I'm burning for you..." 
Rudy turns to the wall. To the lakeside picture of Ashley, a swimsuit siren. Rudy stares sadly. 
RUDY He was burning for you too... 
And puts the letter away. 
CLOSE ON RUDY'S CALENDAR - NIGHT 
As his hand slashes through December 21st. Prison's over. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. IRON MOUNTAIN PRISON - DAY 
Snow swirls. Near blizzard conditions. A heavy steel door BANGS open, held by an EXIT GUARD. And FIFTEEN CONVICTS, make that EX-CONVICTS, trudge onto a fenced drive, covered in snow. 
EXIT GUARD Your world and welcome to it, dumbfucks! Don't be a stranger now! We'll keep the lights on for ya! 
Rudy stumbles out with the group, shivering in a Goodwill hand-me-down coat. Thin canvas, wouldn't keep him warm in summer. 
Secondhand shoes. No possessions. 
He clutches his sides with his hands, hunched over. All fifteen huddle and herd toward the gate at the end of the fenceway. 
BEYOND THE GATE 
There are a dozen FRIENDS and RELATIVES waiting. A few MEN, several WOMEN, a couple KIDS. Bundled in winter coats, hats and hoods. A prison shuttle bus is parked behind them. 
The released cons reach the gate, where a GATE GUARD unlocks the fence to the outside world. Fifteen men are free. 
The ex-cons and relatives scan each other's faces. Wives rush over to embrace their men. Pals nod to ex-cons and trade slaps on backs. Reunion time. 
The snow batters them, wind whipping. Rudy keeps his head down, leaning forward, keeps walking. Toward the bus. But he can't help himself -- he glances up -- 
TO SEE A YOUNG WOMAN 
bundled in a silver ski jacket, pink wool hat with a poofball on top, scarf and mittens. Scanning the released prisoners. 
RUDY 
drops his head, looks away. Climbs onto the shuttle bus. 
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS 
Rudy shakes his arms, basking in the vehicle's warmth. Takes a seat at the back. A couple other lone ex-cons climb aboard. Then the cons with relatives start to pile in. 
Rudy's window is steamed against the cold. He stares into his lap, then reaches for his coat pocket. Takes out the picture of Ashley, in her bikini by the lake. Stares at it. 
He rubs his window with his sleeve. 
Outside, the woman in the silver coat turns this way and that, troubled. She's watching the other ex-cons climbing onto the bus with their loved ones. 
The woman looks back to the prison. The guard closing the gate. The steel door has been shut. No one else is coming. 
Rudy watches her sadly. 
Aboard the bus, the seats fill up. Ex-cons are feeling up their wives, kids are climbing on their absent daddies, buddies are jawing loudly 'bout how the neighborhood's changed. 
The woman outside is now alone. Silver coat, pink poofball. 
Rudy looks at the bikini picture again. 
Then at the shivering bundle. 
Ashley gives a bashful smile, covers it. 
RUDY Do that again. 
ASHLEY What. 
RUDY Smile. 
Ashley smiles again, blushing now. 
ASHLEY No -- 
RUDY One more. Smile. One more. 
ASHLEY (trying not to) No, c'mon -- 
RUDY I've been dreaming about that smile, Ashley Mercer. For a long time. 
They stare across the table, drifting into one another's eyes. 
ASHLEY You're better than the picture in my mind, Nick... (softly) You're real. 
Outside, another truck rumbles by, whipping up snow. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. INTERSTATE MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
And Rudy and Ashley SLAM inside, kissing passionately, limbs intertwined, pawing at each other's coats. Rudy kicks the door closed. Mouths devouring, hands lost in snowy hair. 
They collide with a side table, knocking over a lamp, tumbling onto the lumpy bed. Rudy tears at her silver coat and sweater and turtleneck and capilene and whatever else's she got on, as Ashley's lips explore his neck and body. Writhing and wrestling and rolling off the bed. Bang. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER 
Rudy and Ashley fuck like lovers in R-rated movies. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY - LATER 
The bed sheets lie tangled on the floor. Rudy and Ashley rest naked amidst them. Her pretty young head on his chest, all their inhibitions gone. Rudy strokes her arms. 
RUDY Tell me something. This the first time you've ever done this? 
ASHLEY Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean -- 
RUDY No, not that, no... (laughs, kisses her) I mean this, the whole thing. Start writing to a guy, guy in the bricks. Get a boyfriend like this. Tell me the truth. 
ASHLEY Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to. 
RUDY Yeah. Me too. (considers) Why? I mean I know why for me, why I paid for the ad. But you... why start writing to some guy -- some con -- you don't even know? 
Ashley studies his face, smiles in reflection. 
ASHLEY I told you, Nick. Remember? 
RUDY Tell me again. 
ASHLEY All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn. (beat) A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way. 
RUDY Had some bad relationships, didn't you. 
ASHLEY Not bad. Just regular. (smiles) You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things. 
She turns to him, kisses his chest -- 
RUDY Well, wasn't all me, y'know. 
ASHLEY Yes it was all you -- 
RUDY Guy I was in with... he helped sometimes... some of the romantic stuff, actually... you'd like him -- 
ASHLEY I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words. 
RUDY Y'know, some of the heart mighta been his too... 
ASHLEY Then he shoulda signed his name. 
She turns over playfully, eases herself back atop him. Ready to make up for lost time. With a kiss: 
ASHLEY And he'd be here right now. 
INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY 
Ashley runs through an Xmas-decorated megamall, dragging Rudy behind her. Both of them laughing, as she hauls him over to some cookie bakery company: 
RUDY Where the hell are you going? 
ASHLEY Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions! (to cookie matron) What's good?! 
COOKIE MATRON Oh my, we've got a special on our chocolate crunchie elves, they're shaped like little helpers -- 
ASHLEY THIS MAN... has not had a cookie in two goddamn years! Get him two of everything! 
RUDY Ashley, Jesus -- 
ASHLEY Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick. (to cookie matron) Hurry up! 
RUDY Ash... didn't you write me that you don't eat chocolate? 
ASHLEY Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby. (teasing smile) So don't talk to me about little white lies. 
INT. J.C. PENNEY'S DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 
RUDY I'll see what I can do. 
ASHLEY No, lover. I'll see what you can do. 
She smiles, sashays sexily away. Rudy watches her go, admiring his good fortune. Then pops the trunk, collects some of their shopping score. Gifts and goodies. 
RUDY (sings, sotto) I have no gifts to bring, parum-pum- pum-pum. No treasures for the king, pa-rum-pum-pum-pum... 
Loaded down, he struggles to the motel room, balances bags on his knee, gets the key in the door, and heads inside. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Pitch dark. Rudy fumbles his way in: 
RUDY ...but I got a girl to be with, rum- pum-pum-pum... 
MERLIN (O.S.) Hi, Nick. 
Rudy drops the shopping bags, whirls around, as a stocky black shadow, MERLIN, all 280 pounds of him, KICKS the door shut -- 
RUDY What the fuck -- 
-- and SWINGS a baseball bat toward Rudy's chest. Rudy gets an arm down to deflect the blow, but it still stings like a mother. Rudy HOWLS. Merlin comes at him again -- 
-- and this time Rudy slips by. Merlin's bat SHATTERS a dresser. 
Rudy grabs him by the neck, kicks out his knees and wrests him to the ground. Grabs the bat -- 
-- and gets DECKED from behind by another shadow, PUG, a little white guy with a snarl. They go CRASHING onto the bed, grappling for leverage, and then to the floor -- 
-- where Rudy grabs a champagne bottle from the groceries and BASHES it backwards, shattering it over Pug's head! 
Pug lets go, as Rudy scrambles up, and Merlin's got him again in a bear hug. Rudy's struggling, whirling with him, crashing into one wall, then another, YELLING for help -- 
RUDY HEYYY!!! IN HERE!!! HEYYY!!! 
-- until he hears the PUMP-LOAD SNAP of a shotgun. 
Rudy stops still. A lamp clicks on. 
Standing in silhouette, a figure in a leather duster holds a sawed-off on him. 
GABRIEL Welcome home, Nick. 
Another lamp comes on. Rudy, still in Merlin's choke-hold, gets a look at the gunman, GABRIEL. Weathered face, stringy hair, early 30's. Handsome in a scuzzy way. He's seen a lot of road. 
Rudy stares, totally thrown. Pug, the little guy, bad teeth, bad hair, bad skin, gets up spitting blood and champagne. 
PUG I owe ya a drink, ya fuck -- 
-- and slugs Rudy in the gut. Merlin yanks him back up. Merlin's a black widebody, wears a goatee and brass knuckles. Behind Merlin stands a fourth intruder, a stone-faced Indian in a Grateful Dead longsleeve. JUMPY. Guarding the door. 
Gabriel's studying Rudy, up and down. Nods. Merlin relaxes his choke-hold so Rudy can breathe. 
RUDY You... you don't know me -- 
GABRIEL Oh, I know you, Nick. I know you real well. 
RUDY No, you can't -- 
GABRIEL The hell I can't. 
As the room's door gets kicked open -- 
ASHLEY Watch out, baby! I'm bringing in the fucking tree! 
and the silver fake evergreen fills the doorway, getting forced through with Ashley's grunts and groans -- 
RUDY ASHLEY! 
Merlin traps his jaw shut. The tree comes squeezing through, followed by Ashley, face in branches -- 
ASHLEY I'm telling you, we got the best one in the store... I don't know why people want their houses smelling like the stupid woods... 
She's GRABBED from behind by Jumpy. Ashley screams, but he slams her against the wall. The tree hits the ground. 
RUDY NO! 
ASHLEY NICK! 
Rudy fights to help her, but Merlin's got him. Pug locks Ashley's arms. She fights, muffled cries, but Jumpy and Pug have her held firmly. Her face to the wall -- 
GABRIEL (re: the silver tree) Hope her taste in men's better than her taste in Christmas. 
Ashley's turned to face him. Her eyes widen. Gabriel nods. 
GABRIEL Hey, sis. Happy holidays. 
Rudy's jaw drops. He looks to Ashley. Then to Gabriel. 
Ashley YELLS, enraged, kicking and clawing. Jumpy slams her back against the wall for her trouble -- 
GABRIEL Jumpy, don't hurt her, now. 
Gabriel steps to Rudy. Studies him. 
GABRIEL So. This is the guy you been waiting for. Man of your dreams. 
ASHLEY Gabriel -- ! 
GABRIEL (unimpressed) Must have a way with stationery. 
Gabriel drops beside Rudy, with a sick smile: 
GABRIEL I've read your letters, motherfucker. Don't play no reindeer games with me. 
EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT 
As we SWOOP DOWN onto a four-lane stretch of winter highway, arcing into the blackness. 
CLOSING ON an 18-wheel tractor trailer, RUMBLING onward, emblazoned with "Great Lakes Trucking." There's an airbrush painting on the door to the cab, of a skeleton looking thru a flaming radial tire, and the legend "Motor City Monster." 
INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - CAB - NIGHT 
Gabriel at the wheel, Merlin smoking, Jumpy eating cookies. A TRUCK passes; Gabriel waves. A moment later, the CB crackles: 
PASSING DRIVER (OVER CB) Hey there, Monster! What're you hauling this far north? 
GABRIEL Hell, Bugeye. How you doin'? Ain't hauling, man, I'm up for the holidays. Gonna have myself a holiday... for a goddamn change... 
INT. GABRIEL'S RIG - TRAILER - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON RUDY 
eyes closed, dried blood, head rocking side to side. He winces, waking, with the headache to end all headaches. 
ASHLEY (O.S.) Shh, Nick, shh. They won't hurt you now. You're okay... 
Her hand strokes his face. Rudy's eyes struggle open. 
ON FULL SCENE 
They're in the back of the truck. There's some packing mats, rope, two tall storage lockers, and Ashley's Chevy Nova. 
Rudy's head is in her lap. He struggles to sit up, finds his wrists tied with cord. He looks at Ashley, follows her gaze. 
In a corner, Pug sits guard in a beanbag chair. He's dipping chewing tobacco, reading Road & Track, headphones on. Gives Rudy a bored glance, then back to his magazine. 
ASHLEY I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore. 
RUDY Your brother... 
Ashley nods. Rudy looks around, remembering. 
RUDY ...the truck driver... 
ASHLEY He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not... 
From the corner, Pug spits some chaw. Ashley wheels. 
ASHLEY You're not gonna hurt him anymore! 
Pug doesn't even look up. Still stroking Rudy's face: 
ASHLEY Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job -- 
RUDY What the fuck is going on. 
ASHLEY He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters. 
RUDY What's going ON!!! 
The truck shakes. 
ASHLEY He knows you worked in that casino. 
Rudy stares at her. She's scared 
RUDY You motherfucker. 
ASHLEY Nick, no -- 
RUDY You sold him out. 
ASHLEY Nick -- 
RUDY When'd you decide to do it, Ash? After which of his letters, huh? The fortieth? The fiftieth? The first?! 
ASHLEY Nick, what are you -- 
She reaches out for him; Rudy scrambles to his knees, tumbles against the opposite wall of the trailer. 
RUDY I'M NOT NICK! (raging) You thought you'd fuck him over?! Well he's fucked you! I've never worked at some casino! I can't help you! Because he's not me! 
ASHLEY Nick, I love you -- 
RUDY JESUS CHRIST! 
PUG Watch your mouth, man. It's Christmas. 
RUDY I'M NOT NICK! 
Ashley runs at him, wraps her arms around him tightly. He tries to fight her off. She won't let go. 
RUDY Get the hell off of me! 
ASHLEY (hard whisper) Nick, it won't work. It won't work! 
Rudy stops fighting. She has a terrified look in her eye. Checks to Pug: he's watching them now, chewing slower. Ashley turns them away from the little guy's view 
ASHLEY He'll kill you. 
RUDY You're not hearing me here -- 
Merlin and Jumpy stop. Ashley stops screaming. Gabriel turns. 
RUDY About the Tomahawk! What the hell do you want to know! 
His guards look to Gabriel. Rudy nods, sweating. 
RUDY I spend six months writing poetry and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over. Thanks for the stamps, Ash. You want me, you got me. Whaddya want to know. 
Ashley gasps relief. Gabriel smiles. 
GABRIEL Everything. 
Merlin and Jumpy march Rudy back. Still on the ground: 
ASHLEY I love you... Nick, I love you... 
Rudy won't meet her eyes. 
GABRIEL Hey. She says she loves you, Nick. 
RUDY She says a lot of things. 
GABRIEL She's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. You just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. My sister loves you, motherfucker, and I ain't gonna have you break her heart. 
RUDY Wish I had a brother like you. 
GABRIEL A girl says she loves you, you say something. 
Rudy looks at Ashley. Her eyes plead forgiveness. 
RUDY I had better sex in prison. 
GABRIEL Heyyy. Be nice, convict. We're gonna be working together here. (to his boys) Get him back in the rig. 
Merlin and Jumpy wrench Rudy backward. Ashley reaches out to him, starts to speak. He looks right through her. She goes silent, casts her eyes to the snow. 
PUG (O.S.) He's not the guy, Monster. 
Everyone looks to the truck. Weasel-faced Pug has sidled next to Gabriel. Spits some chaw. 
It hits Merlin's boots. Merlin growls. 
PUG Whole time you were driving, he was telling her he's not the guy, he's not the guy. I know why he'd tell us he's not the guy. why's he telling her he's not the guy? What if he's not the guy? 
Gabriel considers, jumps off the truck. Walks to Rudy: 
GABRIEL The man who wrote those letters loved Ashley, boys. He lived for her love. (nods) Let's see him live for love. 
Gabriel puts a gun under Rudy's chin. Rudy flinches. 
GABRIEL Where's she work? 
RUDY What? 
GABRIEL (forces gun harder) Wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? Where's she work? 
RUDY J.C. Penney. Beauty and fragrances. 
GABRIEL What's her middle name? 
RUDY (thinking hard) Samantha. 
GABRIEL What'd they call her in high school? 
RUDY Bam Bam. 
GABRIEL What'd they call her in college? 
RUDY What college. 
GABRIEL Where'd she drop her cherry? 
ASHLEY Gabriel! 
RUDY Canada. 
GABRIEL Be more specific. 
RUDY A station wagon in Canada. 
GABRIEL What's her greatest fear? 
RUDY Her brother. 
GABRIEL Wrong, Nick. It's drowning. 
RUDY No. It's her brother. 
Rudy stares him down. Gabriel shrugs. 
GABRIEL That's love. 
He puts the gun away. Ashley regains her breath. 
GABRIEL Let's get back on the road. It's time to start talking, Nick. Time to start telling tales -- 
RUDY Nick don't talk till Nick gets something. 
Gabriel gives a challenging stare. Rudy stares right back. 
It's a showdown. 
Merlin exhales some smoke in Pug's face. Pug hacks, shoves him. 
GABRIEL And Nick? If you even think about setting us up, giving us some bad information? We go down... you go down... (lets it settle) Now. Christmas Eve. How many guards are there gonna be? 
Rudy surveys the table. All five waiting for him. Sighs. 
RUDY Hell. Ten? 
GABRIEL And which of these doors here lead up to the security level? 
Gabriel passes the map across the table. Rudy stares at it. 
MERLIN Start talking, Nick. 
Rudy's still staring. 
PUG Start talkin 
RUDY Who the hell made this map. 
GABRIEL What? 
RUDY I said, who the hell made the map? 
GABRIEL I did. 
RUDY This isn't the Tomahawk. 
GABRIEL What the fuck are you talking about. 
RUDY This is the front entrance, right? You get through the slots, you hit craps here, not blackjack. Blackjack's here to here -- lined up. What's this, the cage? Cage is over there, hard to get to, you got it all mixed around -- 
PUG That's what it looks like! 
RUDY Since when? What the hell is this room? 
MERLIN Buffet. Whaddya think it is? 
RUDY Buffet is by the goddamn bar! What the hell kind of map is this?! 
Gabriel reaches across the booth, grabs Rudy's shirt, pulls his face to table level: 
GABRIEL We walked the place for a week. 
RUDY And I worked there. For a year. 
Neither man blinks. 
PUG Map is kinda dirty, Monster... 
RUDY They changed the layout. 
GABRIEL What? 
Rudy nods, pretending to be dawned upon. 
RUDY They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it-- 
ASHLEY Jack. Jack Bangs. 
RUDY Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain. (pushes map away) I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where? 
GABRIEL They wouldn't have changed the security setup. 
RUDY When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh... (stumbling) ...the Powwow Safe. 
JUMPY The Powwow Safe? 
RUDY His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed. 
Gabriel stares at him, suspicious. 
GABRIEL So what the hell good are you... 
RUDY You'd have to get me inside. (carefully) Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map. 
GABRIEL Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you. 
PUG So what? 
GABRIEL They recognize him, they'll remember him after the job goes down. 
RUDY They won't recognize me. 
GABRIEL Why not. 
RUDY Trust me. They won't recognize me. 
GABRIEL We'll trust you when we're rich. Why not. 
RUDY 'Cause you're gonna get me a disguise. 
Rudy locks eyes with Gabriel. 
RUDY I give you the wrong information, you're gonna shoot me. Well, I don't know your damn map. So you can either find a way to get me in there... or you can shoot me right now. 
A WAITRESS comes over, drops their check on the table. It rests near Rudy. Rudy locks eyes with Gabriel. 
And pushes the check his way. 
EXT. SNOWY HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
ASHLEY We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this... 
RUDY We? What "we"... 
Rudy stares at her. The smile gone. 
RUDY Get your own room, Ashley. 
ASHLEY Nick... 
RUDY Get your own room. 
Ashley pulls away, walks to the door. Turns back, wanting to say something, but Rudy's not even looking her way. 
ASHLEY If I'd told you what he wanted, you'd have been gone. You'd have gotten on that bus and stayed on it. And if that's selfish, I am. If that's lying, I'm a liar. But I been dealing with fucked-up brother and his fucked-up friends for a long time, and I was stronger than him then and I'm stronger than him now. 'Cause he showed up for money. I showed up for love. (hard) And if you're so ready to make me your enemy... then what did you show up for, Nick. What did you really want... with me... 
With a fiery look, she strides from the room. 
Rudy stands, can't get far cuffed to the bed. Checks the end table, finds a Bible and a deck of cards. 
Out his second-floor window is a view of the rear parking lot. 
Rudy watches as a Chevy Blazer parks and two drunk FISHERMEN get out. The truck's bumper sticker reads "Ice Fishermen Do It All Year Long." 
Rudy watches the good ol' boys stumble toward the hotel. He turns back, surveys his new prison cell 
RUDY They've never done a robbery... (nods) Christmas is looking up. 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MORNING 
The bed has been dragged to the door to the bathroom, the comforter and pillow are on the floor, "Miracle on 34th St." is on the TV, and Rudy lies asleep on the ground, ankle still cuffed. 
Two SHADOWS fall across him. 
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 
Rudy is brusquely dragged out by Jumpy and Merlin, passing Ashley, who lies asleep in the hall, head on a pillow. 
MERLIN Having romance problems, Romeo? 
RUDY Not with you. 
They march him onward. Rudy glances over his shoulder at Ashley. 
Who spent the night at his door. 
INT. GAME ROOM - MORNING 
A wood-panelled room adjacent to a small indoor pool, with arcade games and a dart board. Gabriel's with Pug, tossing darts, as Jumpy and a chain-smoking Merlin haul Rudy in. 
PUG Goddamn, Merlin. There any part of the day you don't smoke? 
MERLIN There anytime you don't got a mouthful of shit? 
PUG Cancer-sucker. 
MERLIN Acid-chewer. 
Gabriel THWAPS a dart into the board, to shut them up. 
GABRIEL Take a look what Pug's bought for ya. 
Pug empties a shopping bag on a pinball machine. Cowboy boots, spurs, a black cowboy hat, a black rhinestone jacket and a longhaired wig tumbles out. 
RUDY A cowboy. You're going to send me into an Indian casino disguised as a cowboy. Have you thought this entirely through? 
GABRIEL Put it on. 
Merlin and Jumpy shove Rudy toward the merchandise. Gabriel slams another dart into the board, then turns: 
GABRIEL You're a country-western singer up from Nashville for the the holidays. Visiting your Grandma on the lake, driving into the Tomahawk for some scotch and slots. You only play the slots, you got that? Don't want no dealer friend of yours recognizing you, you sidle up to shoot some craps. 
RUDY What kind of half-ass cowboy plays the slots? 
GABRIEL You do. 
RUDY At least gimme video poker. 
GABRIEL Shut the fuck up. You play what your girlfriend plays. Ashley's going in with you. You talk to her, otherwise you don't talk to nobody. You walk the room as many times as you want, but the second you come out, I want to know the run of the place. 
Rudy examines his new hair and cowboy gear. 
RUDY Do I get a country-western name? 
GABRIEL You get recognized, convict, You get a country-western funeral. 
EXT. TOMAHAWK CASINO - DAY 
The Chevy Nova crunches into the parking lot in the shadow of the gaudy neon axe. 
INT. NOVA - DAY 
Rudy's in "disguise": paste-on goatee, tinted shades and black cowboy gear. Very Nashville Network. 
He's wedged between Jumpy and Merlin, wearing handcuffs. Gabriel, Ashley and Pug in the back. 
RUDY Y'know what, guys? I woke up this morning, I got a really lucky feeling going on. I mean it, I'm feeling that good. I wouldn't be surprised if I walk in there, pull a handle and hit jackpot. Hell, we wouldn't even have to -- 
GABRIEL Get out. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 
YOUNG GOVERNOR We want you doing the job... that we brought you here to do. 
INT. TOMAHAWK - DAY 
Rudy and Ashley move away from a change booth, with a bucket of quarters. Rudy messes with his cowboy getup, noting two SECURITY GUARDS punch a code in a private door, step inside: 
ASHLEY So does it look a lot different? 
RUDY Here and there. Restaurant, uh, that's the main expansion. Tables've been moved around; the big man's office, I dunno, might be upstairs now. 
They settle at a slot machine. Another SECURITY GUARD walks past them. Rudy turns his back. Ashley notices. 
ASHLEY That guy knows you? 
RUDY Yeah, uh. Mike. That's Mike. 
At the door, Merlin and Jumpy enter, wandering through the slots. 
Rudy sees them. 
RUDY You start spending your brother's money. I'm gonna take a circuit around the joint, check for any new ins and outs. I'll snag us some drinks. 
As he strides away -- 
ASHLEY (sotto) Be careful, Nick... 
MOVING THROUGH THE CASINO 
with Rudy, ambling among the tables, making a show of checking out the layout. In reality, he's surveying the GAMBLERS. 
Passing the cage, he walks right by Jack Bangs and the Indian governors. Jack Bangs is all smiles, while the governors turn their backs an him and storm out. 
ARRIVING AT THE BAR 
RUDY Couple rum and Cokes, please. 
INDIAN BARTENDER You want that rum and Coke or rum and Pepsi? 
Rudy gives him a strange look. The bartender shrugs. Rudy still scans the tables, settling on -- 
A BLACKJACK TABLE 
where a trio of COLLEGE KIDS are forking over chips. One of them's dark-haired with a goatee, a sweatshirt and jeans. Rudy studies this kid for moment. 
JACK BANGS (O.S.) Gimme a goddamn bottle of anything. 
BACK AT THE BAR 
Jack Bangs sidles up, distraught. The barkeep hands him a bottle. Bangs takes a swig. 
JACK BANGS I can't go back to Vegas, Bear. They'll fuckin' kill me, 'kay? I can't go back... 
BARTENDER What does the tribe want? 
JACK BANGS They want gold-paved roads is what they want. Talking 'bout the fuckin' Paiutes. Fuckin' Paiutes are on the interstate. Nothing I can do about that, man, I didn't pick the spot for your reservation. 
BARTENDER Neither did we. 
JACK BANGS Yeah, yeah, whatever. 
Rudy gets his drinks, as Jack Bangs turns his way: 
JACK BANGS Hey. Hey, cowboy. Jack Bangs, I run the place. Nice to have you in the Tomahawk. Tell me something... 
Rudy winces, glancing to see Merlin and Jumpy watching him. Frowns on their faces. 
JACK BANGS ...does upstate Michigan need another roadside casino or does upstate Michigan need an international gaming destination? 
RUDY (wants outta here) Roadside casino? 
Jack Bangs, smile falls flat. 
JACK BANGS Well, so how'd you hear about this place, then. Word-of-mouth? Mass mailings? Cable TV? 
RUDY Prison. 
JACK BANGS Prison?! 
Rudy shrugs, smiles, takes off with his drinks. Bangs looks sick, turns to a FAT GUY on the next stool over. But before he can ask, the guy shakes his head -- 
FAT GUY I just stopped in to use the can. 
Bangs turns to the bartender, puts his head in his hands: 
JACK BANGS I can't go back to Vegas, Bear... I can't... 
From the slots, we hear a JACKPOT PAYOFF. 
JACK BANGS Aw fuck. 
THROUGH THE TABLES 
walks Rudy, as Merlin sidles up next to him: 
MERLIN What the hell was that about -- 
RUDY He didn't recognize me. Back off, willya? He didn't recognize me. 
Merlin eyes him darkly, but lets him walk on into the slots. As he nears Ashley, he glances to the blackjack table, where the College Kid has left... heading for the bathroom -- 
ASHLEY Hey Nick! We're up fifty cents! 
-- and Merlin slams the door in their face. Gabriel hurls another bullseye, then retrieves his darts from the board. 
GABRIEL A for effort, Nick, honestly, A for effort and an honorary degree. I'm surprised you never escaped from the Mountain. 
RUDY (teeth chattering) ...never... tried... 
GABRIEL Nick, here's what we're gonna do. In the spirit of the season, I'm going to give you a chance. I understand you're unhappy. Right outta the lockup, here against your will, it's the holidays and there's reruns on TV. (beat) So we're gonna have a contest. 
Gabriel strides back to him, with two darts. 
GABRIEL We're each going to get one of these. Whichever one of us hits closer to the bullseye... gets what he wants. (beat) You land closer, you get Ashley. And you guys get to go free. I land closer... and we start getting your help. 
He lifts Rudy's shaking hand, puts a dart in it. Rudy's fingers are half-frozen, they don't bend. Gabriel has to wedge it in. 
GABRIEL May the best sportsman win. 
Gabriel turns to the board, ten feet away, and tosses his dart. It thunks in the "13" wedge of the outermost ring. 
GABRIEL Damn. 
He steps aside for Rudy. Rudy struggles to raise his hand, trembling badly. He focuses on the board, teeth chattering, tries to reposition his fingers, rears back and throws -- 
-- except the dart remains in his frozen grip. He brings his icy hand back, tries to move his fingers. And the dart finally tumbles out and hits the floor at his feet. 
Gabriel smiles, steps close. 
GABRIEL Got something to say to me, Nick? 
RUDY ...ttt..tt... two out of three? 
Gabriel grabs his jacket and hurls him backward. Rudy CRASHES into a chair, flanked by video games. 
GABRIEL What'd you tell that casino manager? 
RUDY Nnn... nothing... 
GABRIEL You were talking to him! What'd you tell him!? 
RUDY Nothing... I promise-nothing... 
GABRIEL MAYBE SOMETHING ABOUT A ROBBERY? 
RUDY NO! 
Gabriel spins to the dartboard, pulls out a fistful and wheels. He whistles a dart at Rudy's head. it SMACKS the wall beside his ear. 
He whistles another. It TRUNKS right above his head. A third HITS the wall by his chin. 
RUDY He thought I was some gambler... he didn't know me... he didn't recognize me! 
GABRIEL I been driving rigs a long time, Nick. Four, five million miles of road. Worked for people who wouldn't keep me on less I was driving fifteen hours a day. Tell 'em I needed sleep, I needed rest, shit, they'll hire someone else... 
Gabriel flings another dart. Just misses Rudy's other ear. 
GABRIEL ...Dispatcher's screaming for me to haul ass, he's got a load on the runback for me. Shipper's making me wait for the pickup, receiver's bitching 'bout the count... 
Another dart NAILS the wall, right through Rudy's hair. 
GABRIEL ...Got the cops at the bottom of every mountain, got the DOT at the top. And every day, every day, I see all those faces in their little airbag Hot Wheels, moms and pops and jam- faced kiddies, giving me that look to go to hell and get off their happy goddamn highway. Hey. They don't gotta get two thousand miles by sundown, or the gang don't eat come sunrise. 
Gabriel strides to Rudy, sitting stock-still, his head ringed by darts. Stares him down. 
GABRIEL It's time for me... to be working for me. I want mine, Nick. And I need you. (frightening calm) Did you tell your manager there's gonna be a robbery? 
RUDY No, Gabriel... no... 
Gabriel pulls the darts free. Backs away again. 
RUDY ...he... he asked me... how I'd heard about his place... he didn't know it was me... 
GABRIEL RAISES A DART TO THROW 
RUDY I PROMISE YOU HE DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS ME! 
-- and then lowers it. Believing he's gotten a reprieve, Rudy relaxes, his shivering coming under control. 
RUDY Man, Monster... just... just don't start trying to hit me... 
GABRIEL Nick. I been trying to hit you. 
Gabriel rears back and WHISTLES another dart. It plugs into Rudy's chest. Rudy screams. Gabriel FIRES another, skewering him in the ribs. Then a third, fourth and fifth. 
Rudy howls in pain, his body too numb to defend itself. Five darts protrude from his chest, colorful plastic feathering and spreading rivulets of blood. 
GABRIEL Maybe that'll help sharpen your memory. 
Gabriel stalks close. 
GABRIEL Tonight we're gonna take another look at that map. And this time you're gonna tell me what I need to know. 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM - DAY 
Rudy gets hurled inside by Merlin and Jumpy. He hits the floor beside the bed, where Ashley sits prisoner. Pug sits guard, watching "How The Grinch Stole Christmas" on TV. 
ASHLEY Nick! Jesus, Nick -- 
She falls to his side. Merlin cuffs Rudy's ankle again to the bedframe. He and Jumpy head out -- 
MERLIN Pug. 
Pug's engrossed in the cartoon. They're singing in Whoville. 
A medieval-themed biergarten. A happy FAMILY of five sits at a booth, singing along to "Good King Wencelas." 
In the booth beside, Merlin and Pug are holding court. Merlin's puffing smoke rings. Pug watches dully, chewing: 
PUG Knew a guy in Joliet, smoked ten packs a day like you. His lungs got so black they couldn't find 'em with an x-ray. 
MERLIN That right? Shit. I used to run rigs for a guy loved your chaw there. Shit rotted out his tongue, had to build him one outta silicon so the poor boy could talk. You ever see a motherfucker with a silicon fucking tongue? 
The Happy Family stops singing. Pug considers, spits a wad. 
PUG Hell. The guy from Joliet, those black-ass lungs were the least of his problems. Got so much smoke in him his lungs couldn't even hold it. Got into his system, man. Into his blood. Coming out his ears, man, coming out his eyes. Guy'd be walking the row, smoke'd be puffing out his skin. 
The Happy Family trade discomfited looks. Merlin shrugs, takes another drag. 
MERLIN This trucker? Met a girl in a bar one night, she didn't know his situation. He's drunk, she's drunk, they get to mackin' hot and heavy and the woman swallows it. His tongue. Sucks it right down. 
PUG My guy would walk into a room, set off the goddamn sprinklers. 
MERLIN His lips went next. You ever see some silicon-fucking-lips? 
The Happy Family flees their booth. Pug and Merlin glance over. And grab their leftovers. Rifling the grub: 
MERLIN (with disgust) Vegetarians... 
Behind them, Gabriel and Jumpy file into the biergarten, leading Rudy and Ashley to the booth. Meeting commenced. 
Rudy, battered and freezer-burnt, gets shoved in first. Gabriel throws down the casino map: 
GABRIEL Start singing. 
RUDY I have no gifts to bring, pa-rumpum- pum-pum 
GABRIEL Sing it in pictures, Nick. 
Rudy takes the map, glances at Ashley, and then takes charge. For the first time, he's giving the orders: 
RUDY What you gotta worry about first is the guards. Place doesn't look much richer than when I worked there, so let's figure you're gonna have to deal with ten of 'em. There'll be two on the floor, walking the room, that leaves eight up above. Eyes in the sky. They see something up, they're the ones who'll hit the silent alarm and you're fucked. 
MERLIN How do we take them out? 
RUDY You gotta get someone upstairs. 
MERLIN How do we do that? 
Rudy takes the map, points to the gaming tables area: 
RUDY Across from blackjack, there's a security doorway. Keypad access. 
GABRIEL What's the code? 
RUDY Uh... they change it every month. I wouldn't know. (beat) If there's trouble on the floor, you'll get security coming through. what you gotta do, is get inside that doorway once they do. You gotta draw 'em out. 
PUG Without having them hit the alarms. 
RUDY I got an idea on that one. Once you're up there, you gotta hold those guards down till some backup can get there. There's a security camera room that videotapes everything. You've gotta destroy every last one of those tapes. 
MERLIN What about the money? 
RUDY You lock down security, you move behind the cage. You hit the Count Room. There'll be a guy in there but he's got no guns; room's accessed by another code. Cashiers'll know it. They'll have alarms. 
JUMPY What about the Powwow Safe? 
RUDY What? 
JUMPY The Powwow Safe. The secret safe. You said the manager's got a safe in his office where he hides skim money. 
RUDY Oh. Right. Yeah. That's, uh upstairs. Uh. Here. Powwow Safe. 
His confident manner wavers. Gabriel notices, narrows his eyes. Rudy quickly grabs the map again: 
RUDY So. You're gonna need a man through here, two men at the cage, one to cover the count. You're gonna need a lookout outside, a sweeper through the back, and a gun guarding the front. (beat) You need six. 
GABRIEL We got five. Putting Ashley outside. 
RUDY You need six. 
Gabriel eyes him darkly. 
GABRIEL NO. 
RUDY You go in with five, you're either leaving an alarm free or an exit free. Someone hits an alarm, you're fucked. Someone gets to a phone, gets outside, 'cross the street, whatever, you're fucked. You need six. (nods) Six is me. 
GABRIEL No. 
RUDY You guys get caught, I go away for good. I got an interest in making sure you don't. You need a sixth man covering an exit. What're you gonna do about it. 
ASHLEY Yeah. What're you gonna do about it. 
She puts an arm around Rudy, smiles. That's her man. 
GABRIEL I want a map of that security level. Every room, every guard, every thing. 
RUDY Six men means six guns. 
GABRIEL No way. 
RUDY I'm no threat without a gun. 
GABRIEL No, you're not. 
RUDY There'll be people in that casino. I can't keep them from leaving if I don't get a gun. I don't need bullets, Monster... but I gotta be a threat. 
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL 
Merlin reaches Rudy's door. Searches his pockets for the key. 
EXT. PARKING LOT 
Rudy darts to the front of the Blazer, slipping and sliding on asphalt ice. He drops to his knees, pushing on the front bumper. 
The wheels start to move. 
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL 
Merlin finds a room key. Puts it in the lock. Turns the handle but the door won't open. Merlin checks the key. 
MERLIN My room. 
EXT. PARKING LOT 
The Blazer starts to roll backwards, toward the snowy shrubs ringing the building. Headed for the empty parking space below Rudy's window. Rudy keeps pushing. The Blazer picks up speed, rolling on its own. 
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL 
Merlin searches his pockets again, finds the right key. 
EXT. PARKING LOT 
The Blazer rolls toward the building. Rudy scrambles to his feet, runs after it, leaps his left foot onto the bumper, the right foot onto the hood, then onto the roof -- 
-- getting two roof-steps worth of running start -- 
-- as the Blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs -- 
-- and Rudy dives into the air, torpedoing himself right through the window to his room -- 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM 
-- where he crashes headlong to the floor, turning a somersault and landing sprawled across the carpet. 
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL 
The key in the lock, Merlin hears the crash -- 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM 
-- and as Merlin opens the door, he finds Rudy sitting calmly on the floor, ankle-cuff locked once again to the bedframe. Spreading a deck of cards out before him. 
Starting a game of solitaire. He looks up. 
RUDY Hey. 
Merlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. The window's open. Rudy continues his card game. 
Merlin watches him for a long time. Then pulls the door shut. 
Once he's gone, Rudy collapses to the floor. Breathing hard, heart pounding. The cards go flying. 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The LIGHTS go out. Rudy creeps back to the window, checks outside... and stops still. In parking lot... 
...a cigarette glow burns inside the Nova. From the driver's seat. It's Merlin. Now watching. 
Rudy steps back into the shadows. Closing window and watches the falling snow. Caged again, after all. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER 
Pitch dark. Rudy asleep on the floor, as Ashley creeps back in. 
Seeing he's asleep, she lies beside him, pulls a blanket over them both, nestles into his body and kisses him. 
ASHLEY Merry Christmas-Eve, my love. My love, my love. Merry Christmas-Eve... 
Ashley closes her eyes. With a smile. 
A moment later, Rudy's eyes open. Turning to look at her smiling, sleeping face... with a convict's vengeful stare... 
INT. KNIGHTS INN LOBBY - DAY 
CLOSE ON DESK CLERK 
In a elfin cap, smiling cheerfully: 
SMILING DESK CLERK Hello, gentlemen. And how can we help you on this holiday morning? 
CLOSE ON GABRIEL, MERLIN AND PUG 
Three grim faces. 
GABRIEL Checking out. 
EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - DAY 
The three truckers stride to the Nova, where Jumpy guards Rudy and Ashley. In the b.g., the Ice Fishermen are by their car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces overnight. 
Gabriel marches straight to Rudy and SLUGS him in the gut. Rudy hits the snow -- 
ASHLEY Gabriel! 
GABRIEL That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view. (then KICKS him) And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar. 
INT. TOMAHAWK - ON BLACKJACK 
Rudy bolts up suddenly, sends chips and his chair to the carpet. 
Points sternly at the Old Timer, slurring: 
RUDY Switch seats with me. 
OLD TIMER What? No... 
RUDY You're taking my money. Switch seats with me. Switch seats with me if you're not taking my money -- 
OLD TIMER I'm ninety-two years old -- 
RUDY Then get yourself another table! You're hitting Santa's cards and you're taking Santa's money! 
OLD TIMER There is no other table -- 
RUDY THEY'LL OPEN ONE! 
Rudy grabs the blackjack table and wrenches with all his might, 
OVERTURNING IT, cards, chips, cash scattering -- 
AND EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT ONCE 
Two SECURITY GUARDS at the door (?) rush for Rudy -- 
Gabriel steps from the restroom, hall, moves toward the keypad door to the security level -- 
Jumpy carries his bucket of quarters past the cage -- 
Rudy tackles the Old Timer, fists and false teeth flying, as the Guards arrive, trying to wrench him off the poor guy -- 
RUDY (hard whisper) Stay down, pop! Trust me, stay down! 
As Gabriel stops just beyond the keypad door -- 
IN THE SECURITY LEVEL 
The Security Boss grabs more men, while Jack Bangs merely smiles at the sight. Guards wrestling a drunken Santa: 
SECURITY BOSS Help them down there! HELP them! 
IN THE CASINO 
Three guards CHARGE out of the keypad door -- 
-- right past Gabriel, who slips deftly inside -- 
AND UP THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE 
-- opening his coat, pulling his assault rifle -- 
GABRIEL 
Right at the top of the stairs, right at the top of the stairs... 
-- charging to the top, starting right and running SMACK into a wall. 
He spins, sees the doorway's on his left -- 
TO A PRIVATE HALLWAY 
with three doors. Gabriel stops at the first, grips his gun -- 
GABRIEL Video room, video room -- 
-- and swings open a closet bathroom. He frowns, confused. Jumps to the second door -- 
GABRIEL Map said video room -- 
-- and swings open a storage closet. Gabriel grumbles, leaps to the third door and flings it open, 
GABRIEL Map said goddamn video room! 
TO REVEAL THE MAIN SECURITY AREA 
-- with two Guards sitting at their posts, and Jack Bangs, the Security Boss and the Video Guard in the doorway to the video room. Which is on the far opposite side of the space. 
As they turn to see the furious Santa Claus with the AK-47 -- 
GABRIEL WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON??!!! 
-- as he SPRAYS the ceiling with GUNFIRE. 
INT. CASINO FLOOR 
Where the RIFLE sounds, just as Jumpy grips his bucket of quarters at the cashier's cage and wheels -- 
-- throwing a fragmentation grenade's worth of quarters at the two Cashiers! Bits Of metal flying between the bars. They SCREAM, stepping backwards in defense -- 
-- and Jumpy whips a sawed-off shotgun from his coat -- 
JUMPY Step BACK from the desks! 
AT THE BLACKJACK 
The five guards wrestling Rudy spin and scramble, pulling pistols from shoulder holsters as -- 
MERLIN 
THE CHEVY NOVA 
CRASHES through the casino doors, MOWING DOWN the firemen! 
The car SLAMS inside, crashing into slot machines. The slots send SPARKS showering into the air. Which set off the casino floor's SPRINKLERS. The room fills with watery spray. 
Ashley swiftly climbs out of the mangled vehicle. Rudy stares darkly at her. She knows he knows. And she doesn't care. 
ASHLEY (wild-eyed) WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK! 
RUDY Yeah. That's love. 
She storms on by. The slots pay off behind her. 
INT. COUNT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Jumpy, Merlin, Ashley and Rudy step inside the Count Room. There are stacks and stacks of bills. 
Ashley smiles wide, throws Jumpy three laundry sacks. 
ASHLEY MOVE, MOVE, MOVE! 
Merlin, meanwhile, slams Rudy against the wall: 
MERLIN You knew there were guns in here! 
RUDY Merlin, I didn't know -- 
MERLIN You got Pug killed! You tried to get ME killed! You just lost your Get- Outta-Jail-Free -- 
RUDY I promise you, I didn't know! 
As Merlin puts a gun to Rudyls head -- 
GABRIEL (O.S.) (over casino speakers) Santa Claus, Santa Claus, and Santa Claus... would you please bring our... mapmaker... to the security level? 
Merlin stares daggers at Rudy. Shoves the gun away. 
INT. JACK BANGS' OFFICE - NIGHT 
Gabriel stands at the windows overlooking the watery carnage. The taped jingle of slots still plays. 
Poor Jack Bangs lies on his desk, beaten to a pulp. Blood runs down his face and shark suit. Tears and shock: 
JACK BANGS I can't go back to Vegas... I can't... go back... 
JUMPY (O.S.) What the hell is with this place? Thought the video room was back there -- 
Merlin and Jumpy lead Rudy in. Ashley follows. They carry bulging money sacks. Gabriel stares Rudy down. 
GABRIEL I told you not to fuck us with that map, Nick. I told you not to, and you did. How am I s'posed to keep my promises now? (Ashley joins him) How's she s'posed to keep hers? 
He kisses her hard. Sloppy. Grins. 
Then points to Jack Bangs: 
GABRIEL He won't tell us where it is. The Powwow Safe. 
JACK BANGS I don't know... what you're... 
Gabriel hammers him with the butt of his rifle. CRACK. 
GABRIEL THE POWWOW SAFE! WHERE IS THE POWWOW SAFE! 
JACK BANGS What... Powwow... 
GABRIEL The Powwow Safe where you steal your money! Where you cheat your Indians! 
JACK BANGS I don't steal any -- 
Gabriel CRACKS him again. And again. Rudy winces. Gabriel grabs Rudy, pulls him over. 
GABRIEL We KNOW about the Powwow Safe! We KNOW it's in here! We KNOW how you work! Because WE know who's worked for you! (smiles) Remember a guy named Nick Mason!?  A security guard named Nick Mason!? 
Gabriel pushes Rudy's head toward the desk. Jack Bangs, drooling blood, eyes swollen, turns his face to see. 
JACK BANGS Nick... Mason... ? 
Jack Bangs stares at Rudy. Rudy stares back. 
JACK BANGS ...so where is he? 
GABRIEL (laughs, mocking) Where is he?! Where is he?! 
JACK BANGS He's not Nick Mason... 
The smile fades from Gabriel's face. 
JACK BANGS Nick Mason... worked for me two years ago. This man... (a spark of recognition) ...he's some cowboy... 
Gabriel grabs Rudy, slams him against a wall. He glares at Ashley for answers. She stares in disbelief. 
Rudy meets her eyes. 
RUDY Fucked the wrong guy, Ashley. (shrugs) Story of your life. 
BACK TO GABRIEL: 
RUDY I did time with Nick Mason, Monster. Told you that from the start. 
Ashley's putting it all together... 
IN THE CASINO 
Gabriel and Ashley have scrambled to the Nova, tumbling in with the money sacks. Jack Bangs gets up, stalking toward them, still FIRING and babbling. 
Gabriel FIRES back, hitting Bangs in the chest. He staggers, but stays upright. His bullets RIDDLE the car, shattering the windshield, but Gabriel and Ashley keep their heads down, slamming it into reverse -- 
-- and burning rubber backwards out the casino entrance, into the parking lot, and speeding out of sight. 
Jack Bangs stops shooting. 
He staggers back toward the bar, totters there, and turns, gun still raised. 
Rudy stands at the base of the stairs to the security level. He puts his hands up, until he sees the dying look in Bangs, face. The uzi drops to the ground. 
A silence. Even the slots have stopped. 
RUDY I'm sorry. 
Jack Bangs stares blankly. Surveys the wreckage of his poor man's empire. And gives a small shrug. 
JACK BANGS That's why they call it gambling. 
He slumps against the bar and hits the floor. Dead. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Rudy ambles out into the snowy night. The lot is quiet. He takes a few wary steps toward the road -- 
-- and hears a CLICK. He turns to see Ashley standing behind him, with a gun. Shaking her pretty head. 
ASHLEY Your turn. 
Rudy shuts his eyes for the end. 
EXT. RESERVATION ROAD - NIGHT 
The Nova drives up a ramp into the back of the truck, in reverse. Gabriel gets out, pulls shut the trailer. Ashley collects the hazard triangles. They hurry to the cab. 
EXT. MICHIGAN HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
The Motor City monster storms through the night, passing a couple POLICE CARS, sirens wailing, speeding the other way. 
INT. GABRIEL'S RIG 
Gabriel and Ashley inside, with the money sacks: 
GABRIEL With the wrong fucking guy! We took the place down with the wrong fucking guy! Is that Christmas?! Huh?! Is that Christmas?! 
He grabs Ashley, kisses her wildly. Then turns back -- 
TO THE SLEEPER COMPARTMENT 
Where Rudy lies sideways, hands bound with his Santa belt. 
GABRIEL God bless us every one... 
EXT. RIDGESIDE ROAD - NIGHT 
A winding two-lane road, overlooking a small ravine at a grassy overlook. The road is dusted with snow; there's been no traffic here for awhile. 
The Motor City Monster steams to a stop beyond the overlook. Then starts backing up, such that the gate of the trailer is fifteen feet from the edge of the ridge. 
A hundred-foot drop into the ravine below. 
Gabriel and Ashley pile out of the cab. They lift the trailer gate, extend the tire ramps. The ramps run from the trailer to five feet away from, the ravine drop. 
IN THE CAB 
Gabriel pulls Rudy out of the sleeper. Marches him back -- 
TO THE RAVINE'S EDGE 
-- and gives him a look. Forces him to his knees. Ashley is in the truck trailer, splashing the inside of the Nova with a can of gasoline. 
GABRIEL You almost got away with it, Santa. Got outta the Tomahawk, got to your car, got halfway to Canada till you caught some ice in the road. By the time you hit bottom down there, whole car was burning like a comet.  Musta burned up all that money too. 
Rudy glances to the trailer. Ashley tosses a couple handfuls of bills into the car. 
GABRIEL Buncha guys in red suits busted in, they'll say. Started shooting. They won't be able to remember... if it was three, or four... or five. Four dead Santas and some burned-up cash. Merry Christmas, The End. 
RUDY Was it your plan, Monster? Or was it hers. 
Gabriel smiles at him. 
GABRIEL She told me 'bout the convict magazines. Had to figure there'd be some boys in the pen with some useful knowledge. With nobody to talk to. Nobody to listen. So we stocked up on stationery. 
Ashley hops down. Gabriel puts an arm around her. 
GABRIEL Hard life being a trucker's girl. 
Rudy eyes Ashley. She stares darkly back. 
RUDY I saved your life. 
ASHLEY You shouldn't have. 
RUDY He did love you, you know. Nick. He did love you. 
ASHLEY Who wouldn't. 
So cold. But Rudy doesn't pause. 
NICK Why not have her pretend to find me? Pretend to write me and reel me in? Tell her new trucker-man she'd pose as some sister of his named Ashley? 
RUDY And you set me up. 
NICK Always wanted to rob that casino, Rudy. Way back when I worked there. What better way than to get some guys to rob it for me. 
Nick shrugs. Prods Rudy up the ramp. Into the trailer: 
NICK Paid the Alamo ten bucks to put the shiv in me. He's a lifer, what does he care. Paid a hospital guard fifty to put out the story I was dead. Once the wound healed up... (notes cash-sacks) Got out of the Mountain this morning. And tonight I'm a rich man. 
RUDY How'd you know I'd do it. 
NICK Do what? 
RUDY Walk outta there and tell her I was you. 
Nick looks back at Ashley. 
NICK Because every time I read her letters, Rudy... you listened. (to Ashley) Keep your gun on him. 
Nick forces Rudy inside, unties the belt from his wrists and lashes them to the bottom of the steering wheel. 
NICK Five Santas walked into that Tomahawk, Rudy. That's what the witnesses'll say. So we gotta have five Santas not walk out. Gotta have five... (working) This'll burn right away... in the fire... 
Nick gets Rudy's wrists locked to the wheel. He laughs. 
NICK Hell, you never needed to convince Ashley you were me. Just the dumb fucking truckers. I figured I'd talked enough about the Tomahawk in the pen for you to get by -- 
RUDY Talked about the old man's weapons stash, probably forgot I'd remember 
NICK Hm. Well. They'd have killed you if you weren't me, Rudy. We knew you'd start convincing 'em soon enough. 
Nick slams the car door, locking Rudy in. 
NICK They had the weapons and the willpower. We just gave them their inside man. 
RUDY You gave them me. 
NICK I gave them me. (shrugs, smiles) Said some nice things about me, Rudy. I appreciate it. But don't worry. I do love her. And she loves me. You had that right all along. 
Nick reaches across him, releases the brake. Puts the car into "Drive." Turns to Ashley: 
NICK Sweetness! Let's light up the tree! 
Ashley steps toward the ramp, taking out a matchbook. Nick steps further into the trailer, to the back of the Nova. 
IN THE CAR 
Rudy immediately wriggles his hands, trying to touch his wrists together. Trying to press together the white cuffs of his Santa suit. Trying to get the right pressure point -- 
-- as a BLADE suddenly springs out of the cuff! The switchblade he'd stolen from the Blazer -- it's lashed to his right wrist! 
Rudy starts sawing his wrist back and forth, cutting through the Santa belt -- 
-- his hands at the bottom of the wheel, too low for either Ashley or Nick to see -- 
IN THE TRAILER 
Ashley is at the hood of the car, LIGHTING her match. Nick is at the back bumper, ready to push it down the ramp -- 
NICK Goodbye, Rudy! Nice spending time with you! 
IN THE CAR 
The belt breaks! Rudy snaps his hands free! But instead of trying to escape, he reaches under the steering column, RIPPING its panel away and pulling wires free! 
As Ashley tosses her match onto the hood, and FIRE races over the body of the car, TONGUES racing inside, over the dash, over the seats, lapping at Rudy -- 
-- who ducks his head beneath the wheel, frantic to locate the right leads -- 
IN THE TRAILER 
Ashley jumps out of the way, to the snow. Nick pushes the flaming car to the trailer's edge -- 
-- starting on down the ramp, the ravine ahead -- 
-- and as gravity starts to take the metal bonfire -- 
IN THE CAR 
Rudy sparks two wires together, FLAMES eating at him -- 
RUDY LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIKE, LIKE RIDING A BIIIIIKE! 
-- and the ENGINE IGNITES! 
Rudy slams the gearshift into "Reverse", grabs the wheel and looks over his shoulder at shocked Nick behind him -- 
RUDY RULE ONE! NEVER PUT A CAR THIEF BEHIND THE WHEEL! 
-- and SLAMS the accelerator. 
ON FULL SCENE 
As the burning Nova races backwards up the ramp, and back into the trailer -- 
Terrified Nick turns to run but there's nowhere to go -- 
-- and the car SLAMS into the trailer's back, CRUSHING Nick's legs between metal and metal! 
ASHLEY NOOOOOOO!!!

"FRIDAY THE 13th" 
FADE IN: 
1    EXT.  ROAD - DAY 
The TRACK is SILENT. 
The CAMERA looks at a sign.  It reads: 
CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE Established 1935 
Gradually we can begin to hear, in the BG, the SOUNDS of CHILDREN playing. 
CUT TO: 
2    EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY 
In the BG a few dozen CHILDREN, in camp uniforms, are enjoying a game of softball. 
In the FG CLAUDETTE is looking for someone.  CLAUDETTE is 17 years old.  She is pretty.  She wears a t-shirt with "Assistant Counsellor" written on it.  She fills out the shirt very well. 
Failing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks quickly in the opposite direction. 
The CAMERA holds on the game for a few seconds and we SUPERIMPOSE: 
JULY 4, 1958 
The CHILDREN'S VOICES FADE slowly. 
CUT TO: 
3    EXT. RIFLE RANGE - DAY 
ECU as a COUNSELLOR squeezes off a shot. 
The paper target is ripped in the black. 
The COUNSELLOR hands the weapon to a CAMPER who snaps in at the line. 
CLAUDETTE shouts up to the COUNSELLOR from the BG. 
CLAUDETTE Have you seen Barry? 
The COUNSELLOR smiles.  Shrugs. 
COUNSELLOR He and Chloe were at the Lodge last time I saw him. 
CLAUDETTE leaves.  The COUNSELLOR smiles. 
CUT TO: 
4    EXT. MAIN LODGE - DAY 
Two CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses.  CLAUDETTE passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE. 
BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE, and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with cow eyes.  In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out an Everly Brothers hit. 
BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get.  He is not ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl. 
CLAUDETTE We've got to talk. 
BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail.  Nods. 
BARRY Okay. 
5    BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former. 
Closer.  The THEME has snuck in.  It becomes discordant.  It swells.  Closer. 
QUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the perspiration streaking their flushed skin. 
Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror. 
A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the blow. 
The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY.  The PROWLER's powerful hand has him by the throat.  He backpeddles, trying to get away. 
ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree. 
A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky. 
BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist.  The knife falls to the mossy floor of the clearing. 
Two hands go for the free blade.  BARRY's hand has it. 
There is a confused jumble of struggle. 
Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER. 
REACTION SHOT:  BARRY, horrified by the sight. 
The PROWLER's hand has the knife.  It moves quickly forward. We can hear the blade strike. 
BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek. 
MCU the moss where the finger fell.  The PROWLER reaches into FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME. 
QUICK CUT TO:  CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors. She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror.  The MUSIC has stopped abruptly. 
THE SCREEN BLEEDS TO WHITE. 
It is completely SILENT. 
CUT TO: 
8    TITLE SEQUENCE 
The screen is completely black.  A small white shape starts to ZOOMS towards the FG.  The shape becomes a three-dimensional rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH.  Just as it gets to its final position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane of glass.  There is a loud crash.  The logo shifts to the upper left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black. 
The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement. 
TITLES END and the MUSIC fades out. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
9    EXT. RURAL TOWN - EARLY MORNING 
The TRACK is SILENT. 
In a LONG SHOT we see the one main street.  A newspaper delivery truck drives away from the CAMERA.  A GIRL walks down the street. 
Superimposed title: 
THE PRESENT 
A MEDIUM SHOT in front of the bank reveals a day/date/time/temp sign which blinks: 
FRIDAY, 13 
60 Degrees 
FRIDAY, 13 
60 Degrees 
OIL MAN Climb on up, Miss. 
The OIL MAN gives her a boost up and then climbs aboard the rig. 
CUT TO: 
12    INT. OIL TRUCK - DAY 
As the truck pulls away, we see RALPH through the windshield, standing at the edge of the road.  He is angry and upset now. He pats his rats. 
The OIL MAN shifts, looks over and smiles.  His two front teeth are missing on top. 
OIL MAN Must be the fourth time somebody's tried to reopen that place. 
ANNIE Camp Crystal Lake? 
He nods. 
OIL MAN Something always happens up there. 
He turns on the radio in the cab and we hear the DJ again. 
DJ (V.O.) ...of bed.  I'm gonna count to three and then you better get up.  It's 7:24.  A beautiful day.  Weatherman Dr. Jim says it's gonna be a nine point five day. Here's Meatloaf from the Bat Out of Hell album. 
CUT TO: 
13    EXT. RURAL ROADS - DAY 
The oil truck thunders along the road. 
CUT TO: 
14    EXT. RURAL CROSSROADS - DAY 
The oil truck has stopped.  ANNIE stands alongside the driver's side. 
OIL MAN Don't let the spooks getcha, Annie. 
ANNIE smiles. 
ANNIE No sweat.  Thanks a lot for the lift. 
He nods and shakes his head with the sense of what might have been if he were thirty years younger.  He puts it in gear and roars off. 
ANNIE looks around and sees an old gas station.  It is closed. There's a sign which reads:  "No Gas 'Til Sat."  A mangey dog sits on the stoop watching ANNIE. 
ANNIE kneels down and calls the dog.  The dog comes.  ANNIE pets him and then heads off up the road. 
The dog watches her go. 
CUT TO: 
15    EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY 
ANNIE is beginning to get worried about the time.  It's hot and she's late. 
She looks up. 
From her POV a Jeep barrels along the road towards us. 
ANNIE puts out her numb. 
CUT TO: 
16    INT. JEEP - DAY 
From the DRIVER'S POV, we see ANNIE waiting for a lift.  The DRIVER, unseen, shifts down until ANNIE is alongside.  The Jeep, an uncovered model, stops.  ANNIE smiles a big delicious smile at us as we sit in the DRIVER's seat. 
In a final desperate move, ANNIE drives into the underbrush to escape. 
The Jeep skids to a stop. 
CUT TO: 
25    EXT. ROADSIDE/WOODS - DAY 
The CAMERA becomes the DRIVER and chases into the thicket. Branches and briars snap back at us.  Just ahead, the terror- stuck ANNIE stumbles and falls.  She screams as a knife flashes past her in a blur. 
When the knife has passed, all we can see is a look of surprise on ANNIE's face. 
The CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Her throat has been cut.  She collapses out of FRAME. 
A bird soars across the sky above. 
The TRACK is SILENT. 
CUT TO: 
26    EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
A gaily decorated camper-van travels along the highway.  We hear rock 'n roll OVER coming from a car radio as this much-in- need-of-repair vehicle passes a slower car. 
CUT TO: 
27    INT. CAMPER VAN - DAY 
In the camper van are three young people.  They are full of fun, fresh and expectant as they head towards Crystal Lake. They are instantly likeable. 
At the wheel is NED, a short 22-year-old whose well-developed upper body is a tribute to his weight-lifting.  He is nice- looking, a joker who is always trying to get some attraction. He is funny and alert. 
Next to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as American as popcorn.  He is quieter, two years younger and not as smart as NED.  He has to think things through. 
MARCIE is JACK's girlfriend.  She is leaning over the front passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders. 
She is a funny girl, pretty, and always looking for fun.  She enjoys every minute of every day.  She hasn't been touched by tragedy. 
MARCIE Sex is all you ever think of, Neddy. 
NED There you are dead wrong. 
JACK Ha! 
NED Sometimes I only think about kissing women. 
MARCIE finds a sore spot on JACK's back. 
JACK Ow! 
NED I was just wondering if you thought there'd by any other gorgeous women at Camp Crystal Lake.  Besides yourself. 
MARCIE You are a true pierce of work, Ned. 
MARCIE hits NED on the arms, playfully. 
MARCIE (continuing) How about our last jay? 
JACK Good call. 
JACK reaches into the glove compartment and comes out with a joint. 
NED What about the dope paragraph in Mr. Christy's letter? 
JACK Quote:  Controlled substances are expressly forbidden.  Possession or use of marijuana or alcohol on campgrounds will means instant dismissal.  Unquote. 
MARCIE We got two weeks before the kids even arrive.  Then I'll act responsibly. Until then, hit me. 
STEVE sets off. 
STEVE I'd rather she painted.  Let's go, folks. 
As soon as he's gone, NED turns to ALICE. 
NED I thought we had two weeks... 
ALICE shrugs. 
ALICE You can changed in three. 
CUT TO: 
33    EXT. EDGE OF LAKE - DAY 
The CAMERA looks down a long line of canoes, each with its hull up.  A brush slaps into view.  BILL is sweating while finishing a coat of paint on the last canoe. 
BILL is a thin, ascetic-looking college sophomore.  He rubs his long thin rose with the back of his wrist as he hears someone call his name OS.  He turns to see ALICE at the bottom of the trail. 
ALICE Steve said for you to start on the boats. 
BILL I finished the boats. 
ALICE nods slowly. 
ALICE I'll tell him. 
She turns away. 
BILL Alice?  The others show up? 
ALICE Everybody except the girl who's supposed to handle the kitchen.  Annie. 
BILL puts his brush in a coffee can of turps. 
ALICE look at him, then turns again. 
BILL You think you're gonna last all summer? 
ALICE I'm not sure I'll last all week. (pauses) I'll tell Steve. 
CUT TO: 
34    EXT. GIRL'S CABIN - DAY 
STEVE and NED are rehanging a door.  Next to them is BRENDA, a dark Eurasian girl who is trying to do a good job of painting the wall.  On the other side MARCIE is scraping some flaking paint. 
STEVE Shim it up just a scooch. 
NED levers the door higher at the top. 
STEVE (continuing) Perfection.  Hold it. 
STEVE uses a long ratchet screwdriver. 
STEVE (continuing) To answer your question, my parents once owned this camp.  There were some tragic accidents and they went bankrupt.  I promised them I'd reopen if I could. See if it closes right now. 
NED swings the door on its hinges. 
NED Looks good. 
STEVE Perfection. Did you meet Brenda? 
BRENDA turns and nods. 
STEVE (continuing) She's archery.  He's rifle ranged.  And I'm behind schedule.  Let's go, Ned. 
ALICE I don't know.  Probably be best for everybody. 
STEVE You may not care a lot about this place, Alice, but I mean to make it my whole life.  It's been my whole life.  Gimme a chance.  Stay a week.  Help get it ready.  Next Friday, if you're not happy, I'll put you on the bus myself. I'll be grateful. 
He puts out a hand and runs the back of it across her cheek. 
She looks up.  She nods. 
ALICE Next Friday. 
STEVE Thanks, Alice. 
He stands up. 
STEVE (continuing) I've got to go to town and pick up the trailer and all that other stuff, but I'll be back around ten.  If you're still up, we can talk, okay? 
ALICE Sure. 
She watches him cross out of FRAME. 
CUT TO: 
38    EXT. MAIN CABIN AREA - DAY (LATER) 
STEVE is at the wheel of his Jeep.  The COUNSELLORS are standing within earshot, huddled around the Jeep. 
JACK You want it listed separately? 
STEVE Yeah.  Brenda, after lunch hit the archery range.  If Annie gets here, have her start in on the kitchen.  Do your best.  Tomorrow we have a preliminary inspection by the state safety people. I'd like to look good. 
He wheels the car around and out the driveway.  The others stand looking before NED breaks the silence. 
NED He neglected to mention this place is called "Camp Blood" downtown. 
They are all getting back to work. 
ALICE How come? 
NED Some campers drowned.  Then some counsellors got killed. 
BILL No shit.  When? 
NED Late fifties sometime.  They never caught the guy who did it either. 
MARCIE Neddy collects weird facts.  Next he is going to tell us that there are poisonous snakes in the outhouse and green lizards in the lake. 
As they laugh, the CAMERA HOLDS on ALICE. 
CUT TO: 
39    EXT. ARCHERY RANGE - DAY 
BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job.  She enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of this area.  She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated. 
BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter and heads for a tripod in the middle distance.  There are already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far. The targets are heavy.  This isn't an easy one-person job. 
The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets closer to setting up the target. 
In MCU, she lifts a target up.  Her head is very close to the face of the target.  She gets it up, lets the tripod take the weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by eighteen inches. 
BRENDA whips around. 
WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES:  a very cocky NED, standing by the lean- to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked simultaneously.  He has a feather stuck in his hair. 
She grabs the arrow and storms at him. 
BRENDA You're crazy! 
ALICE It's long and personal.  It has nothing to do with you or the other kids. 
BILL Maybe I can help? 
ALICE looks at BILL and smiles.  This really is a very nice, if naive, young man. 
ALICE And it's this place.  It makes no sense, but it spooks me. 
BILL (smiling) You're right.  It makes no sense. 
As ALICE nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside. 
CUT TO: 
43    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - DAY 
MARCIE is the source of the scream.  She runs towards the CAMERA, dressed in cut-offs and a floral halter.  Her feet are bare.  When she get closer, we see that she is being chased by JACK and NED who have found two giant green bullfrogs.  The screams were not serious and MARCIE is doing some of it for effect.  BRENDA brings up the rear.  They are all dressed more or less for a frolic in the lake. 
BILL and ALICE stand in front of the Arts & Crafts cabin.  BILL is smiling, ALICE is a little bit amused. 
MARCIE Help me!  Save me!  The frog people are after me!  It's swim time at Camp Crystal Lake.  Come on, Alice, I need protection! 
CUT TO: 
44    EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DAY 
A LONG WIDE SHOT reveals the cool, clear lake during the lull of a hot afternoon. 
At the edge of the lake, in the shallows, are the members of the group:  MARCIE, JACK, NED, BRENDA, BILL and ALICE.  They are sitting or paddling or diving off the float.  There is no real attempt to exert too much energy. 
Gradually we become aware that this LONG WIDE SHOT is someone's POV.  The CAMERA moves from its stable position, now hand-held, on a trajectory around the side of the lake, out of sight. 
Branches, brush, and twigs are butted through.  Occasionally, we can see part of the PROWLER's arm fending off the underbrush. 
CUT TO: 
45    EXT. WATER - DAY 
The group sits or lies in the cool water, more or less focused on NED, who is acting as moderator. 
NED What do you want to be when you grow up? 
BRENDA Dancer. 
MARCIE Cowboy. 
NED Girls can't be cowboys. 
MARCIE Okay, Fireman. 
NED goes to JACK. 
NED Jack? 
JACK Coach, athletic director somewhere. 
BILL Filmmaker. 
ALICE Artist. 
NED Doctor.  Now, if you were a flavor of ice cream, what would you be? 
MARCIE Rocky Road. 
They laugh. 
CUT TO: 
BILL doesn't hesitate.  Carrying his machete, he runs to ALICE's cabin. 
MARCIE and JACK follow in the BG. 
CUT TO: 
58    INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY 
ALICE is backed against the wall.  The snake could strike and get her. 
BILL runs into the room, still carrying his machete.  He looks at ALICE. 
ALICE (a tight whisper) There's a fucking snake in here. 
BILL sees it.  He freezes, then takes a step forward. Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the machete, cutting the snake into two pieces.  Blood spurts onto the floor. 
MARCIE and JACK enter.  JACK carries a shovel as a weapon. MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further to see the blood and guts. 
MARCIE Steve never mentioned serpents.  Jack, would you get some paper towels? 
JACK nods and exits. 
ALICE How the... did he get in there? 
BILL Slipped in.  Probably liked the scent of your perfume. 
JACK return and tosses a roll to MARCIE. 
MARCIE Thanks. 
BILL You okay now? 
ALICE nods. 
BILL gives her an extra hug.  Then steps back awkwardly, stepping on MARCIE's big toe. 
MARCIE Go ahead.  I walk on 'em all the time. (to JACK) Would you shovel Mr. Snake outta here? 
JACK nods.  He picks up his shovel and we see in CU as he gets underneath the wide-fanged snake. 
MARCIE begins to clean the blood off the floor with the paper toweling. 
CUT TO: 
59    EXT. CAMP - LATE AFTERNOON 
Looking across the lake, we can see the camp, nestled in among the late afternoon rays of the sun.  We can hear the sounds of the nocturnal animals beginning to rise and hunt. 
CUT TO: 
60    INT. CAMP KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON 
The kitchen and the main meeting room are really one in the same room, cut off by a partition.  The kitchen has a couple of sinks, a heavy old stove, long shelves, a pantry/larder, and some windows which look out on the rear. 
BRENDA is making a salad for herself.  She is a vegetarian. MARCIE is making a guacamole dip. 
In the big room there is a fireplace and a ping pong table. JACK and BILL are playing. 
BRENDA                        JACK She all right?                Get ready for the schneider. 
MARCIE                        BILL Yeah.  Scared the hell out    No chance. of her. JACK BRENDA                Four zip. How'd it get in the drawer? 
ALICE walks into the kitchen.  She has washed her face after getting her act together.  She stands in the doorway to the kitchen. 
MARCIE How you doin'? 
ALICE Okay.  Can I help? 
JACK turns to BILL. 
JACK Give me a hand? 
BILL For sure. 
CUT TO: 
61    INT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON 
JACK steps in and, in CU, we see there is a puddle where he is standing.  The puddle is somehow significant. 
BILL leans over JACK's shoulder to see what he's doing. 
BILL This is almost like the one at my uncle's cabin in Maine. 
JACK Here we go. 
The CAMERA watches JACK's actions tightly.  In a REVERSE POV we see JACK's tongue come out the side of his mouth as he concentrates.  He bites down on it. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  as JACK pulls the starter cord.  The engine roars into action. 
JACK (yelling) Now ya' close the switch. 
CU as JACK's hand reaches in and touches a heavy-duty metal switch.  A spark arcs and we PULL BACK to see JACK with a perfect connection running through his body.  There is a sparking sound, the little light in the shed blinks, JACK screams, the generator chugs roughly.  Hundreds of volts are streaking through JACK's body and grounded through his wet shoes. 
BILL reacts quickly:  knowing better than to touch him and continue the connection, he takes a half-step backwards, aims at an oblique angle and executes a perfect Bruce Lee-type drop- kick on his friend, severing the contact. 
JACK stumbles out of the shack and the light goes dead.  The machine stops. 
CUT TO: 
62    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - LATE AFTERNOON 
JACK lands, almost unconscious.  BILL kneels into FRAME and cheeks JACK's vital sign:  his eyes, his carotid pulse, his breathing. 
JACK shakes his head. 
JACK I'll be okay.  Holy shit... 
BILL Don't get up.  Take a second... 
JACK lies back down.  Covers his eyes with his arm. 
JACK You saved my life. 
BILL I had to. 
JACK Thanks. 
BILL I figured if I didn't save you.  I'd have to give you mouth-to-mouth and that would have ruined my appetite. 
JACKS looks up and smiles.  BILL give him a hand and the groggy athlete gets to his feet. 
JACK Whew. 
Satisfied that JACK won't fall down, BILL goes to the shed and looks in. 
We can look in over BILL's shoulder and see a smoke-scarred switch and a now-silent generator. 
BILL This puddle was enough to ground you all the way to China. 
JACK looks in, too. 
JACK Floor probably leaks.  This area is full of springs. 
BILL A short somewhere. 
BILL                          BRENDA I don't want you getting      Melvin Belli. hurt. NED ALICE                 Aaaargh!  That my I was careless.               guaranteed winner! 
BILL                          MARCIE How'd it get in there?        Melvin Belli? 
ALICE Somebody probably dropped something too hard. 
NED Alice, you're just lucky there are no snakes in the dishwater here. 
NEDDY is hovering over a bowl of California dip which MARCIE has just made.  He dips a chip as soon as she steps back. 
MARCIE Soooooeeeeey, piggy, piggy. 
Suddenly NED's face goes red.  His eyes bulge out.  He grabs his throat and gags.  Coughs, can't clear it. 
JACK What is it? 
BILL Is it stuck? 
NED points to the dip and slumps down on the floor where he writhes about. 
MARCIE                        ALICE Help him!                     Oh, my God! 
BILL                          JACK Roll him over!                Get behind him more. 
As BILL and JACK flip him over to try to give him the Heimlich, NED stops his act and grins from ear to ear.  It's a big finish: 
NED Ta-da! 
REACTION SHOTS: as it sinks in that NED has been putting them on. 
JACK Not funny, Ned... 
BILL stands up, angry, but willing to keep his mouth shut. 
MARCIE Wait'll you're really in trouble and see what happens... 
NED But it's in the brochure!  "Camp Crystal Lake has a full drama program."  You just saw it. 
NED tries to laugh it off.  They shake their heads.  MARCIE walks away.  JACK looks at BILL. 
BILL Chance to get even? 
JACK I'll spot you five points. 
NED Hey, look, I'm sorry.  I'll never do it again. 
NED turns and heads for the door.  ALICE comes up next to him. The OTHERS are out of earshot now.  BILL and JACK play a little ping-pong.  NED is a little embarrassed by his play-acting stunt. 
NED (continuing) I'm sorry. 
ALICE Ned?  We're gonna be working together for a while.  You're a nice guy without all the entertainment, okay? 
NED relaxes.  Nods.  He knows what she means.  He turns to look at the others. 
NED Tell 'em I'm sorry? 
ALICE nods. 
ALICE Sure. 
NED I'm gonna go lie down and catch some z's.  Today wiped me out. (pause) Thanks, Alice. 
ALICE You're welcome. 
The CAMERA stays on ALICE's face as NED exits.  In the BG, MARCIE speaks. 
MARCIE I hope that's the last time we see the Camp Crystal Lake Drama Program. 
MARCIE (continuing) What about Neddy? 
JACK I don't love Neddy. 
MARCIE He keeps on acting like such an asshole! 
JACK (yelling) Ned! 
MARCIE Don't call him. 
JACK I thought you wanted to give him one of your motherly lectures.  Ned is gonna do whatever he wants to do, you know. 
MARCIE I guess... 
The moon is victim of a blank cloud which cuts off the light. 
JACK Looks like a storm. 
MARCIE I'm a little scared of storms.  Always have been.  Since I was a kid. 
JACK You?  The brick? 
JACK shines the flashlight so that we can see her face in eerie shadows.  She flashes hers at him. 
MARCIE I've dreamed this dream.  Maybe half a dozen times.  There is a thunderstorm. The rain comes down like pebbles.  I can hear the sound.  I try to close my ears off.  It doesn't work.  The sounds gets louder.  The rain turns to blood and the blood washes down in little rivers.  And the sound stops. 
A loud crack of heat lightning slices the sky apart.  MARCIE is startled and reaches out for her lover. 
JACK It's just a dream. 
MARCIE I call it my shower dream. 
They look at one another in the two lights.  They grin.  Rain drops begin to fall on their faces and on the lake behind them. 
JACK This is no dream.  Want to escape for a while? 
MARCIE Lead the way! 
JACK turns and jogs toward the nearest cabin.  MARCIE is only a half step behind, laughing. 
FROM A DISTANT ANGLE we watch them run.  There is no theme, just the rumble of thunder... 
CUT TO: 
68    INT. BOY'S CABIN - NIGHT 
The door bursts open, a flashlight pierces the shadows, and JACK and MARCIE rush in and plop on the bottom bunk of the nearest bed. 
MARCIE Are you wet? 
JACK Just a little.  Wait a minute, woman. 
He reaches down and put his flashlight on its end so it points straight up and gives them some light to see by. 
They go into a long passionate kiss which is broken by MARCIE's hand coming up from behind JACK and tugging his t-shirt up towards his head.  He leans back and takes it off, and tosses it at the CAMERA. 
CUT TO: 
69    EXT. FRONT OF MAIN CABIN - NIGHT 
The rain has gathered in intensity.  ALICE comes up to the front door and looks out.  BILL comes up behind her. 
ALICE Jack and Marcie are gonna be drenched. 
BILL Not if they're where I think they are. 
ALICE laughs. 
74    MCU MARCIE:  She rinses her hands, shakes them dry and turns off the water.  Again she hears a noise.  She looks to the row of showers and smiles. 
MARCIE Jack? 
The screen door to the shower room is swinging open and shut. 
MARCIE looks over, smiles.  She thinks someone is trying to scare her. 
MARCIE (continuing) Jack?  Neddy?  Don't put me on. 
There is a dripping sound.  MARCIE stops at the first shower, hesitates. 
Throws back the first curtain.  There is no one there.  She reaches in and makes sure the spigot is really off. 
She goes to the second shower, looks over her shoulder to the empty toilet.  Then reaches in to the shower curtain. 
MARCIE (continuing) Allee allee infree! 
She throws back the curtain.  Again no one is there. 
She breathes a sigh of disappointment. 
MARCIE (continuing) Must be my imagination. 
In CU she turns back toward the sink area when suddenly the TRACK explodes with a MUSICAL STINGER.  It happens in a flash. A shape lunges from the toilet booth across from the first shower.  A hatchet glints.  MARCIE screams.  The hatchet strikes.  The flashlight clatters to the floor. 
CUT TO: 
75    EXT. DINER - NIGHT 
The sound of a cash register ringing up a sale hangs over an establishing shot of the diner.  Through the window, which are being pelted with rain, we can see a WAITRESS and some CUSTOMERS seated on stools at the counter. 
CUT TO: 
76    INT. DINER - NIGHT 
The WAITRESS is different from the morning woman, slightly older, but still attractive.  She says good night to her CUSTOMER, who finishes paying his bill and crosses down the counter.  Seated there is STEVE CHRISTY, finishing his cup of coffee.  The waitress, SANDY, picks up his empty pie plate and tosses it in a pan of other dirty dishes. 
SANDY Anything else you want? 
STEVE No, thanks.  I'm fine.  Sandy. 
SANDY You can't go back there tonight.  Not in that stuff.  'Less you wanta get drownded. 
STEVE (drinking quickly) I got to. 
SANDY Aw. 
SANDY likes STEVE and enjoys flirting with him. 
STEVE I have six new counsellor up there. They're all babes in the woods in every sense of the word. 
SANDY They'll be okay if they know enough to stay in outta the rain. 
How much do I owe you? 
SANDY One night on the town. 
STEVE I mean... 
SANDY ...I know what you mean.  Two and a quarter.  Plus fifteen percent tip to make up for me spending the night alone. 
STEVE pays up and walks to the cash register. 
SANDY (continuing) You got a roof for that Jeep? 
She rings up the money.  Gives him his change.  He hands her a tip. 
BILL and ALICE have made their way to BRENDA's cabin.  From the outside they can see the Coleman lantern burning on the table within. 
ALICE Brenda?  Brenda?  You there? 
There is no response.  The CAMERA stays in a MCU of ALICE as she and BILL cross up the stairs and into the cabin. 
CUT TO: 
102    INT. GIRL'S CABIN - NIGHT 
The SHOT continues on ALICE as she looks about the empty cabin. Finally she stops, looking down.  The CAMERA continues to hold on her face. 
ALICE Bill. 
BILL crosses over to ALICE.  They are both looking down, past the CAMERA LENS. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  WE SEE WHAT THEY SEE:  the bloody hatchet left on Brenda's pillow. 
ANGLE on BILL and ALICE:  (as before).  Their faces are serious. 
ALICE (continuing) What the fuck is going on here? 
CUT TO: 
103    EXT. JACK'S CABIN - NIGHT 
The rain slants down as BILL and ALICE make their way towards Jack's cabin.  They go to the door.  BILL knocks. 
BILL Jack? 
ALICE Marcie? 
BILL Hey, guys! 
BILL opens the door to the cabin. 
CUT TO: 
104    INT. JACK'S CABIN - NIGHT 
The door opens at us.  We see the silhouetted figures of BILL and ALICE.  BILL flips on the light switch. 
The cabin is empty.  Jack's backpack lies on the bed, the contents neatly laid out. 
CUT TO: 
105    INT. CAMP BATHROOM - NIGHT 
It is dark inside.  The door slams open at us as BILL and ALICE make their way inside. 
ALICE Marcie?  Brenda?  Jack? 
BILL walks slowly towards the row of toilets and showers. 
ALICE (continuing) I think we should call the police, Bill. 
BILL, who was just about to open one of the toilet stalls, nods and turns back to ALICE. 
BILL Okay. 
They exit.  There is a beat... and then a slickered shape passes between us and the night sky light which comes through the windows.  The shape is dragging something. 
CUT TO: 
106    EXT. OFFICE CABIN - NIGHT 
ALICE and BILL are on the porch of one of the cabins.  To the left of the door is a small sign that reads:  "Office."  BILL tries the door, but cannot open it. 
CUT TO: 
111    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - NIGHT 
The CAMERA as PROWLER moves to the shed.  The noise of the generator grows louder as the door is opened. 
CUT TO: 
112    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
BILL sits on the chair, a rifle across his lap.  In the BG, ALICE sits on the couch, dozing.  On the coffee table in front of her is a large machete. 
BILL's eyes are closing.  He jerks himself awake, then starts to doze again. 
The bulb overhead grows yellow, orange, and then goes out. 
BILL snaps awake.  He grabs a flashlight by his feet and flicks it on. 
BILL Oh, shit.... 
He goes to the ping-pong table where he has placed some lanterns.  He fires up a Coleman and places it on the pong table. 
BILL checks on ALICE, makes sure she's asleep, then exits, carrying his rifle and a battery-operated fluorescent lamp. 
HOLD on ALICE's peaceful face as she slumbers. 
CUT TO: 
113    EXT. GENERATOR SHED - NIGHT 
The rain has lessened a bit.  BILL approaches the shed with his fluorescent lamp and rifle.  He has the rifle at the ready. 
CU on his hand on the door handle.  He pulls it open. 
CUT TO: 
114    INT. GENERATOR SHED - NIGHT 
The generator stands there quietly.  BILL comes into view, spraying the interior with lamplight. 
In the FG a broken sparkplug which BILL does not see immediately. It has been smashed by the blow of a hammer. 
BILL goes to the gas tank and unscrews the top.  He looks in--there is enough gas.  He puts the cap back on. 
Then his eye catches something.  He looks at the broken plug. He shakes his head and looks around for a wrench to fix it.  He puts the rifle down on the floor of the shed. 
CUT TO: 
115    INT. BIG MEETING ROOM - NIGHT 
ALICE sits up into the CAMERA, startled and afraid. 
ALICE Bill?! 
She gets her bearings and looks around.  Stands up.  She looks at the bulb overhead.  Pulls its string.  No light. 
She sees the lanterns which have been placed around. 
ALICE (continuing) The generator... 
Now that she has figured out where Bill must be, she relaxes a little.  Smiles.  She goes to the mantelpiece, takes the lantern, and walks into the kitchen. 
CUT TO: 
116    INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
ALICE puts down the lamp and goes about filling a big old tea kettle with water.  She puts it on the stove and pops on a burner and prepares two cups of instant coffee. 
ALICE races to the coffee table, looking for BILL's machete. It is not there. 
ALICE The knife! 
She gets down on her hands and knees to look for it. 
LOW ANGLE:  as she scrabbles on all fours.  Nothing under the couch. 
ALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the lamp. 
Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass, shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE. 
It is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced. 
ALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front door. 
ALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited figure. 
ALICE screams.  The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp. 
When ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early forties.  She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking. This is MRS. VOORHEES.  She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long enough to tell her what the matter is.  ALICE sobs incoherently, pointing back to the rear window. 
MRS. VOORHEES There now, my dear.  Please.  I can't help you if you can't talk to me. There, there now... 
ALICE allows the woman to lead her back into the room. 
MRS. VOORHEES leads ALICE to the couch.  In the BG we can see the broken window, but BRENDA is not visible. 
ALICE He's dead... She's dead... all dead... Please save me... oh... poor Bill... Oh my God, oh my God... oh God... 
MRS. VOORHEES It will be all right.  I'll take care of you. 
ALICE Jack?  Marcie?  Ned? 
MRS. VOORHEES comforts her with a strong arm. 
MRS. VOORHEES It's just this place.  The storm. That's why you're all upset. 
ALICE No, no, they're all dead... 
ALICE points over her shoulder towards the ping-pong table without looking. 
MRS. VOORHEES looks, shrugs. 
MRS. VOORHEES I'll go look. 
ALICE's face registers the new terror. 
ALICE They'll kill you!  Don't leave me! 
MRS. VOORHEES smiles warmly. 
MRS. VOORHEES I'm not afraid. 
ALICE waits by the couch as MRS. VOORHEES crosses the room to the back window. 
ALICE All dead?  Neddy?  Oh, Marcie... 
ALICE stands close to the fireplace. 
MRS. VOORHEES reaches the window and looks out.  BRENDA's body sways just out of reach.  MRS. VOORHEES is shocked. 
MRS. VOORHEES Oh, my lord... 
MRS. VOORHEES turns back and, as she passes the ping-pong table, she picks up the lantern. 
ALICE waits at the fireplace. 
MRS. VOORHEES (continuing) I couldn't let them start this camp again, could I? 
ALICE, in panic, looks for an escape.  She grabs the fireplace poker. 
ALICE I won't let you! 
ALICE swings the poker back and forth. 
ALICE (continuing) No!  No!  No! 
MRS. VOORHEES raises her arm to slash downward with the knife. ALICE swings the poker hard to MRS. VOORHEES' other arm and rib cage. 
MRS. VOORHEES is in pain, her face a mask of rage. 
ALICE drops the poker to run for the door. 
MRS. VOORHEES hesitates for a moment, then follows ALICE deliberately. 
Lightning goes off followed quickly by thunder. 
CUT TO: 
123    EXT. MAIN CABIN/TREE - NIGHT 
ALICE gets to the door and stops.  She fiddles with the side of the screen... somebody has latched it. 
CLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at the door, snapping the latch. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the thunder and the lightning.  The THEME is going full-tilt as ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road. 
TWO-SHOT:  as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from above.  A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree.  A rope is looped under his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade protrudes from his heart. 
REACTION SHOT:  ALICE in terror. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair of legs which swing from the same big tree. 
STROBE SHOT:  of JACK, dead. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  ALICE runs for the Arts & Crafts.  In the BG we see can the yellow-slickered MRS. VOORHEES closing the distance between herself and ALICE. 
CUT TO: 
124    EXT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT 
ALICE runs for the door, slams through it. 
The CAMERA waits for MRS. VOORHEES, but she does not appear. 
CUT TO: 
125    EXT. GENERATOR SHACK - NIGHT 
MRS. VOORHEES runs to the door and opens it quickly. 
CUT TO: 
126    INT. ARTS & CRAFTS CABIN - NIGHT 
ALICE is hiding in the shadows behind a table.  We hear the SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three bright overhead lights come on. 
ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to reveal her hiding place. 
She looks for an escape.  There's a window.  She starts for it, then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few feet. 
She carries a machete in her hand.  We see this instrument in CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her. 
The next drawer has a lock and hasp on it. 
ALICE looks around. 
CUT TO: 
130    EXT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT 
MRS. VOORHEES is on her way, charging through the night. 
CUT TO: 
131    INT. RIFLE RANGE SHACK - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON ALICE:  She whacks the hasp with the butt of the rifle.  The hasp doesn't give.  She gives it another butt stroke.  It won't give.  A shadow covers ALICE's back.  She turns. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:  MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway, blocking the light.  Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES steps slowly toward ALICE. 
ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only thing she can.  She takes the weapon by the barrel and, swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall. 
MRS. VOORHEES slams through a flimsy table, crushing it, and drops to the floor. 
ALICE runs out the door. 
CUT TO: 
132    EXT. MAIN CABIN FRONT - NIGHT 
ALICE huffs past the dead camper van, through the mud to the front door of the main cabin.  She runs in quickly.  There is no sign of MRS. VOORHEES.  She turns off the lights and runs into the kitchen. 
CUT TO: 
133    INT. KITCHEN AREA - NIGHT 
ALICE looks from side to side, hoping to find a place to hide. She spots the half-open door to the larder, looks inside and then hides there, closing the door behind her. 
CUT TO: 
134    INT. LARDER - NIGHT 
There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices. ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type which requires a key to unlock it from the other side. 
ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside. 
As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam. Then we hear some shuffling around outside.  The lights are turned on. 
JASON (V.O.) Please kill her, mommy... Help me, please.  Kill her, mommy. 
There is the sound of pots being rustled through.  Then the sound of another door being slammed. 
ALICE relaxes again. 
Then there is a silence.  ALICE thinks about unlocking the door now.  She reaches out for the lock.  Then thinks better of the idea. 
She cases down the door frame to the floor.  On all sides are the cans of food and cooking implements.  There is a large skillet, some bags of flour, etc. 
ALICE covers her head with her arms. 
The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very slowly.  We see it, but she does not.  MRS. VOORHEES' hand finishes turning and now starts to push gently.  There is almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested. 
The voice on the other side is very young, very sing-song. 
JASON (O.S.) Come out, come out, wherever you are... 
ALICE jerks back and stands up on the far side of the small room. 
Fists bang in a rage on the floor.

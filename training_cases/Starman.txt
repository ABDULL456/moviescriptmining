From the road Benny and the officer watch as the humanoid figure that just blasted over them flies between the trees and into the white light emitting from the underbelly of the spacecraft. The noise from the ship's power plant is deafening as it begins to rise above the trees. 
With Mike at the wheel the police car, its rack lights flashing, fishtails up the dirt road and slides sideways to a bone-jarring stop next to Benny and the officer. As they jump out of the way they find themselves facing into the super white beam of the figure that was in the house. They are between it and the ship. At the angle that it is coming up the hill, the light looks like it is heading directly for them. This is too much for the officer and in terror he raises his shotgun and fires wildly at it. The figure veers off and disappears into the fog. 
With an awesome roar the spacecraft reaches escape velocity and hurtles into the night sky. The concussion waves knock Benny and the officers off their feet. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 
The escaped figure's light comes out of the fog at tree height. We hear the high-pitched whistle of its rockets. A burst of percussive language comes from behind the faceplate. 
SUBTITLE Lander four to Mapmaker Wind. Fix position for rescue. Repeat. Fix position for rescue. 
EXT. HOUSING TRACT - NIGHT 
The fires on the hillside have been renewed. Shaking, Benny and the officer rise to their feet and start toward the light shafting straight up from the figure lying on the hillside. The only sound is police chatter coming out of the radio in the open squad car. 
EXT. LOGGING ROAD - NIGHT 
An 18-wheeler with a load of logs lumbers past us. 
INT. TRUCK - NIGHT 
It feels cozy with the wipers slapping the rain off the windshield. The DRIVER is trying to steal a cigarette out of his snoring PARTNER'S pocket without waking him up. He gets one and reaches for the lighter. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 
The escaped figure banks around a blind corner. 
INT. TRUCK - NIGHT 
The driver gets a glimpse of something in his headlights and slams on the brakes, but it is too late. The figure hits the spoiler above the cab. We hear the smack of impact. One of its boots scars the windshield. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 
The figure bounces off the jack-knifing truck and like a wounded bird tumbles through the air into the trees. With the light spinning crazily, it plunges through the boughs and smashes face first into the mud at the bottom of an embankment. The strip lights on the sides of its helmet go out. 
EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT 
The driver and his partner, standing in the shafts of the high beams, are peering into the woods. 
PARTNER What the hell was it anyway? 
DRIVER Damned if I know. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
The figure thrashes over on its back and tries to close a shoulder-to-hip tear in its life-support suit. By the faint identification light that flickers on and off inside its helmet, we see a MAN FROM THE STARS. His skin is translucent coral. He is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and threatens to suffocate him. 
Under his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head. He is hairless. Underneath a graceful fore-head, transparent eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes. The thin lips that delineate his mouth are chalk-white. 
He tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too weak. His hands drop limply from the suit, allowing the rent to gape open and reveal the translucent body underneath. 
PARTNER (V.O.) Come on. I'm getting wet. 
DRIVER (V.O.) It musta been a bird. 
PARTNER (V.O.) How about if I drive now? 
Behind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off from the shining mass in the STAR MAN'S head and moves down his neck. Through the hole in the suit we see it arrive at the top of his single lung. The white light spreads throughout the organ like a phosphorescent tide. The STAR MAN lapses into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away. 
INT. HELICOPTER (COCKPIT) - DAWNBREAK 
A light rain is falling. 
We are looking through the windscreen at the gray landscape passing under the helicopter. MARC SHERMIN, a grizzled man in his mid-fifties with an honest stubborn face, shifts his attention from the right side to the left side of the craft. Below him he can see the road leading into the housing tract is blocked by police cars. The helicopter leans into a banking turn and the spacecraft's blackened landing site comes into view. Below it an orange nylon tent has been erected over the dead extraterrestrial. It glows from the inside. An Air Force helicopter is parked on the other side of the burn. 
EXT. HOUSING TRACT - DAWNBREAK 
A man in a white contamination suit is helping Benny and the two officers into the Air Force helicopter. The three men are glassy-eyed and wrapped in blankets. Benny has a bandage across his chest. They look up at Shermin's descending helicopter. They are still looking at it when they disappear inside. 
Shermin's unmarked S65 settles on the clearing. The nose door is open and Shermin, carrying the hood of his contamination suit, comes down the ladder. A tall homespun man, also in a hoodless contamination suit, steps forward to greet him. 
MAN (around a cigarette) Major Aaron Bell... 
SHERMIN Marc Shermin, National Security Agency. 
Shermin takes a moment to look over at the tent, the green hillside and the forest beyond. It is pastoral in the soft light of dawn. 
SHERMIN This has always been my favorite time of day. 
MAJOR BELL (MAN) Very beautiful country up here... 
SHERMIN Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that? 
MAJOR BELL Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going. 
SHERMIN Can you see under the faceplate? 
MAJOR BELL No. 
SHERMIN (answering the accusation) Neither did I. 
Major Bell enters the helicopter. 
FOX We're going... Damn! (he shakes his head in disbelief) We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin? 
MAJOR BELL Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship? 
FOX (ignores this) Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground. 
SHERMIN We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here. 
FOX I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need. 
SHERMIN Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing? 
Fox sits silently for a second. 
FOX Contain it and get back to me. 
SHERMIN What do you mean by 'contain?' 
Fox knows Shermin is looking for a definite order. 
FOX Just what I said. 
The television screen is reduced to static. Shermin stares at it blankly then Lyman turns it off. 
EXT. HOUSING TRACT - MORNING 
The lift off of Shermin's helicopter reveals contamination -- suited scientists slipping the dead extraterrestrial's coffin into the Air Force helicopter. 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
The STAR MAN, still in his life-support suit, looks surreal in the twilight world under the canopy of firs. The morning rain has gone. A hum of traffic pulls him across the hill to a stand of alders that border the forest. Through the leaves he can see a highway entering the sprawl of Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The cars and trucks zipping along the asphalt are of particular interest to him. 
When he has absorbed them he walks through the trees to get a better look at the town. On the wind he can hear shouts from students boarding a line of yellow buses in front of a grade school off to his right. Suburban houses have begun to snuggle up to the base of the hill he is on. 
Keeping to the tree line well above them he continues his search for an avenue of escape. His head swivels to watch a Volvo station wagon come down the street. It swings into the driveway of the house directly below him and stops next to a Mustang Hatchback. The back door opens and JENNY HAYDN, a pretty girl in her mid-twenties, gets out carrying a crudely lettered be-ribboned sign 'Welcome Back, Mrs. Haydn.' Female voices drift up to the STAR MAN from inside the car. 
VOICES It was great to have you back... The kids loved it. We loved it. You're doing the right thing... 
EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
JENNY I hope so... We'll see... See you tomorrow... Bye. Bye. 
VOICE (as the Volvo backs out of the driveway) Remember you're required to have a lesson planned tomorrow. 
Jenny laughs and waves. With the Volvo moving away up the street Jenny picks her newspaper off her walk and goes into the house. 
EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY 
The STAR MAN presses on through the trees. He hears a light plane overhead. He stops and watches until the branches cut off his view. A path between two logs leads him to the tip of a promontory. From behind the cedars growing there, he sits and looks down on the center of Eau Claire. 
Arm in arm, a YOUNG COUPLE meander through the trees. The boy has a blanket over his shoulder and the girl's hair is disheveled. Without seeing him, they walk past the STAR MAN crouched in a thicket of small pines. After they've gone by, he straightens up and watches them walk down toward the highway. 
EXT. HILLSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON 
The sun is setting over suburban Eau Claire. The colors are reflected in the STAR MAN's faceplate as he watches Jenny push a hand mower over her back yard. 
He takes a dusty gray marble out of a leg pocket and while Jenny finishes the lawn he rolls it between his gloves. It turns a glowing gold as it grows in size. When it reaches the dimensions of a baseball, he brings it close to his faceplate and speaks into it. 
STAR MAN (subtitles) Iron channel message. Suit and rockets destroyed. Radical mixture of this atmosphere and ours in helmet allowed chemo-ion response time to adapt my body to this air. Am going to attempt extreme transformation in order to cross land mass to site of our practice landings. If transformation is not fatal, second message ball by next darkness. 
He opens his hands and the ball rises quickly into the sky. Jenny is dumping the grass clippings into a garbage can at the side of the house when the sudden motion of the message ball catches her eye and she watches it quizzically until it disappears. 
EXT. WISCONSIN SKIES - LATE AFTERNOON 
We are on the belly of Shermin's helicopter looking at the tree tops rushing underneath. 
INT. HELICOPTER - LATE AFTERNOON 
Shermin is standing back of Lyman and Bell who are seated in front of the square of television screens watching various shots of the wooded landscape flowing by under them. Shermin scrubs his hands over his face then bends over to stretch his back. 
SHERMIN Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow. 
LYMAN I wouldn't worry about it... There might not be any little league tomorrow. 
Pause. 
MAJOR BELL I'm telling you they're probably friendly. 
LYMAN Then why did they try and sneak in the back door? Tell me that. Why didn't they contact us first and say... 
RADAR TECHNICIAN (loud) UFO coming out of the grass. 
SHERMIN Lock in. 
RADAR TECHNICIAN Got it. 
STAR MAN (repeats) Steering wheel. 
JENNY (points to the gear shift) Gear shift. 
STAR MAN Gear shift. 
JENNY (slaps the dashboard) Dashboard. 
STAR MAN Dashboard. 
Jenny sees a police car creeping across the intersection ahead of her and interrupts the lesson to stare at it. The STAR MAN looks to where she is looking. 
STAR MAN (alarmed) What?! 
JENNY Eh... police. 
STAR MAN (remembering) Police... 
He raises the gun off his lap. Jenny tries to distract him. 
JENNY (raps on the steering wheel) What?... 
With his eyes on the police car the STAR MAN ignores her. 
JENNY Steering wheel... (she points to the gear shift) What? 
The STAR MAN is intent on the police car. Jenny gives up trying to distract him. The patrol car passes out of their view. The STAR MAN lowers the gun and looks at Jenny. 
STAR MAN (unprompted, points correctly at each item) Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard... 
JENNY (this frightens Jenny even more) Good. 
STAR MAN Good. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - DAWN 
We COME DOWN FROM a red light TO FIND the Mustang stopped behind the limit line. 
JENNY (V.O.) Which way? 
STAR MAN (V.O.) That way. 
The light changes and the car proceeds straight across the intersection. 
STAR MAN (V.O.) Good. 
INT. MUSTANG - DAWN 
While the STAR MAN picks through the contents of the glove compartment, Jenny looks for a way to escape. An all-night laundromat is a possibility, but it's deserted. The STAR MAN finds the switch on a flash-light and flicks it on and off. 
STAR MAN What? 
JENNY (distant) Flashlight. 
He puts the flashlight in his lap along with the owner's manual and gas slips and takes a stack of Discount Coupons out of the glove compartment. 
STAR MAN What? 
JENNY Coupons. 
Jenny sees a set of headlights turn into the oncoming lane. She slides her eyes toward the STAR MAN. He is busy looking through the Coupons. Jenny measures the distance between the Mustang and the oncoming lights. The STAR MAN holds up one of the Coupons and points to a picture of the product. 
STAR MAN What? 
JENNY (curt) Pancakes. 
STAR MAN Pancakes. 
He points to the cluster of letters that spells SAVE 35¢. 
STAR MAN What? 
Jenny doesn't answer. The distance between the two vehicles is narrowing rapidly. 
STAR MAN What? 
Jenny sets her jaw and wrenches the steering wheel violently to the left. 
EXT. STREET - DAWN 
The Mustang skids sideways across the center line. The oncoming van jams on its brakes and swerves to its left. Locked in a skid, it drifts toward the Mustang. 
INT. MUSTANG - DAWN 
The STAR MAN sucks himself back in terror as the van descends on him. It swings past his window and clips the rear fender of the Mustang. Both vehicles shudder to a stop. Jenny claws at her door. It swings open. She is halfway out before the STAR MAN manages to grab the tail of her sweatshirt. Jenny begins to scream at the top of her lungs and keeps it up while he tries to wrestle her down on the seat. 
EXT. STREET - DAWN 
A tall, raw-boned MAN in his late twenties storms around the front of his van. 
MAJOR BELL It was a man though... right? 
SHERMIN The police think he was high on drugs... 
Bell shrugs. 
SHERMIN What do you think? 
EXT. WISCONSIN FOREST - EARLY MORNING 
With a rush the helicopter rises out of the trees and thunders away. 
EXT. JENNY'S HOUSE - MORNING 
There are Eau Claire police cars on the street. Shermin is out back watching Bell pick his way down the hill. Through the windows we see uniformed policemen in the living room. 
MAJOR BELL (slides the last few feet down the hill) Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything. 
SHERMIN It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman. 
The man standing next to her in the picture was her husband and the witness said that was the guy who kidnapped her. 
MAJOR BELL It's the right area, that's for sure. 
Throughout the above, Shermin has noticed a WOMAN in the house next door peeping through her blinds at the activity around Jenny's. She closes the drapes suddenly when she realizes Shermin has spotted her. 
SHERMIN Why the clicking language though? 
EXT. NEXT-DOOR HOUSE - EARLY MORNING 
Shermin knocks and waits on the steps with Bell for someone to answer. We hear a chain being pulled off and the door is opened by a freckled-face MAN in his late thirties, dressed in a business suit and wiping the traces of a breakfast from around his mouth. 
SHERMIN Sorry to disturb you, sir, but there's been some trouble next door. I'd like to ask you a few questions. 
MAN What happened? 
SHERMIN There's a possibility that Mrs. Haydn's been kidnapped. We're hoping you might have seen something. 
A WOMAN in a robe opens the door a little wider to include herself in the conversation. She is as freckled as the man and about the same age. 
WOMAN (to the Man) I told you... 
MAN Judy, that's stupid. 
WOMAN Well, maybe these men won't think so. We were asleep when a helicopter woke me up. It made me so nervous I went into the kitchen for something to eat. I happened to look out the window and there was Scott Haydn with this green thing draped over his arm pulling Jenny down the walk to the car. 
MAN You know that's impossible! 
WOMAN I know what I saw. I've seen him enough times. 
MAN (giving up on his wife and addressing Shermin and Lyman) Scott Haydn is dead. He died about three months ago. We went to the funeral. 
Shermin and Bell exchange a glance. 
EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY 
Jenny's Mustang is sailing through the beautiful Wisconsin farmland. 
STAR MAN (V.O.) R-r-S-s... 
INT. MUSTANG - DAY 
The STAR MAN is copying the letters, upper and lower case, from the Owner's Manual he found in the glove compartment, onto the back of an envelope. 
STAR MAN T-t-U... 
He draws the upper case but has to check the manual for the lower case. 
STAR MAN u-V-v... 
The STAR MAN looks up as they go by a farm. 
STAR MAN (pointing correctly to the various animals) Cow... Dog... Pig... 
He looks to Jenny for confirmation. She nods absently. He returns to the alphabet. 
STAR MAN W-w... 
He forms both the upper and lower case 'X-x' and shows them to Jenny. 
STAR MAN What? 
JENNY (knows what's coming) X... 
Without smiling the STAR MAN opens his mouth and emits a short chirping laugh. 
JENNY What's so funny about X? 
The STAR MAN laughs harder. Jenny watches him warily. He starts to hiccup. He is unable to control it through the laughter. 
JENNY You're full of tricks, aren't you? 
The car starts across the twin cities' bridge. 
JENNY (taps the fuel gauge) We need gas. 
The STAR MAN looks at the gauge. Jenny scrunches against the door to avoid contact with him. 
JENNY No gas. 
STAR MAN No gas. 
JENNY This car runs on gas. 
She presses the accelerator to the floor. The car jumps forward. 
JENNY Gas... 
She takes her foot off the accelerator and the car quickly slows down. 
JENNY No gas. 
EXT. BRIDGE - AFTERNOON 
JENNY (V.O.) Gas. 
The Mustang spurts forward a few yards. 
JENNY (V.O.) No gas. 
It staggers down to a crawl. 
JENNY (V.O.) Gas. 
The car leaps forward again. 
JENNY (V.O.) No gas. 
It drops back to a crawl. 
INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON 
JENNY No gas... car dead. (her head lolls forward on her chest) We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas. 
STAR MAN Gas good? 
JENNY Yes. Very good. 
INT. MUSTANG - AFTERNOON 
We are LOOKING DOWN Jenny's arm AT a gas station just off Interstate 169 in the Minneapolis suburbs. 
JENNY Gas... 
The STAR MAN contemplates the station as they pass it, then turns to Jenny, puzzled: 
STAR MAN Go. 
JENNY It's closed... closed. We need one that's open. 
STAR MAN Closed? 
JENNY You'll see. 
There are no more gas stations in sight. The STAR MAN becomes bored with the silence. He picks up Jenny's wallet. The driver's license is familiar so he flips to the next window. In it is a picture of an older man and woman standing in front of a church. 
STAR MAN What? 
JENNY (snaps) Not what. Who. What is for things. (touching the steering wheel, dashboard, seat, gear shift) What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he? (points to the man in the picture) Who is she? (points to the woman) Who are you? (points to the STAR MAN) Who am I? 
She touches her chest. 
STAR MAN (mirrors her gestures) Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I? (pause; it clicks for him and he points at Jenny) Who are you? 
JENNY I am Jenny Haydn. 
STAR MAN (flips back to her license and reads) Jennyhaydn. 
Jenny nods. 
JENNY Who are you? 
STAR MAN I am... 
We HEAR MODULATED CLICKS of his percussive LANGUAGE. 
JENNY That's a big help. Where are you from? 
STAR MAN From? 
EXT. GAS STATION - AFTERNOON 
Jenny gets out of the car. When she straightens up, she finds the STAR MAN staring at her over the roof. She slams the door and strides rapidly in the direction of the ladies' room. Stuffing the green pouch in his pocket, the STAR MAN trots after her. 
JENNY (wheels on him as he catches up) Go back to the car. 
The STAR MAN looks at her but doesn't move. Jenny snarls in frustration, then with the STAR MAN on her heels, stalks to the ladies' room and throws open the door. 
INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON 
The STAR MAN follows Jenny inside. 
JENNY See. It's a bathroom. I'm not trying to escape. I just have to go to the bathroom. 
He checks out the stall. 
JENNY Satisfied? Now get out. Out. 
STAR MAN No. 
Furious, Jenny steps around him and opens the door. She points to the sign on it. 
JENNY Women... me. 
She continues out. The STAR MAN goes after her. 
EXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON 
Jenny points to the sign on the next door. 
JENNY Men. You go in here. 
She cracks the door for him. 
JENNY Come on. 
He takes the door from her and pushes it open for a look inside. Jenny ducks into the ladies' room. He is confused for a moment then takes a long look at the men's room. It means nothing to him. He backs out and tries the ladies' room. It is locked. Not knowing what to do, the STAR MAN stands uncomfortably in front of the door, then like a child waiting for his mother, he sits on the curb. He watches the Attendant lift the Mustang's hood and reach in for the dipstick. The numbers on the pumps turn over, adding up the gallons and the cost of the gas. 
Everything is peaceful and quiet within the circle of light cast by the gas station. The STAR MAN pulls the camera disc out of his pocket and points it at the pumps. The cone of light flashes out and pulls back its three-dimensional image. The Attendant turns around and waves genially at the STAR MAN, who waves back a perfect imitation of the gesture. 
The SHARP RUMBLE of a SOUPED-UP HONDA MOTORCYCLE coming up the off-ramp shatters the mood and the STAR MAN gets to his feet. 
He is startled by the image of the RIDER. In a one piece driving skin and helmet he looks amazingly like a space traveller. The STAR MAN steps cautiously forward for a better look and mutters something to himself in his language. The rider stops his bike at the second row of pumps and swings himself stiffly out of the seat. 
RIDER Do I need a key for the head? 
ATTENDANT It's open. 
Without taking off his helmet, the Rider sets out for the men's room. 
RIDER (over his shoulder) Fill it up. 
ATTENDANT You got it. 
The rider's approach frightens the STAR MAN. He backs up to the ladies' room door and knocks. There is no answer. He tries the knob. With the other hand he inches the gun slightly out of his pocket. 
INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Jenny is bent over the sink dabbing nail polish around the corners of a paper towel. Her head snaps around to look at the doorknob. It holds. 
JENNY Just a minute. 
EXT. RESTROOMS - AFTERNOON 
The STAR MAN tenses and forces a smile as the Rider passes in front of him. A VOICE comes from behind the faceplate. 
RIDER Howdy... can't get her out. 
STAR MAN (thru the smile) Gas. 
RIDER I know how she feels. 
The rider enters the men's room. As the door closes behind him, the STAR MAN's face falls and he knocks frantically on the ladies' room door. Jenny opens it under his knuckles. He blocks the doorway and she backs up as he steps inside. 
INT. LADIES' ROOM - AFTERNOON 
The STAR MAN looks around. Jenny's eyes widen at what is happening behind him. The pneumatic arm above the door is pulling it shut to reveal her paper towel pasted to the back. The message on it, written in red lipstick, reads: KIDNAPPED GOING W ON 169 JADE MUS. LIC#PXV237. 
JENNY (stepping around him) It's still a toilet. Hasn't become a ballroom. 
She tries to swing the door open and hide her message against the wall, but she is too slow. The STAR MAN sees it and steps forward to read. 
STAR MAN Kid-nap-ped... go-ing W o-n... 
Jenny realizes he doesn't know what it means. 
JENNY (on her way out) That's very good. 
Other graffiti on the door helps convince the STAR MAN Jenny's message has nothing to do with him and after a last look at it, he follows her. 
JENNY (finally) Horses. 
STAR MAN (without looking at her) Horses. 
Jenny TURNS ON the RADIO and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN STATION. 
STAR MAN What? 
JENNY Music. 
It is pleasing to him and he listens for a while, then reaches in his pouch and takes out one of the dusty gray marbles. He rolls it between his palms. It changes to a glowing gold as it grows to the size of a baseball. 
JENNY (alarmed) What are you doing?! 
The STAR MAN brings the globe close to his mouth and speaks into it. 
STAR MAN (subtitles) Iron channel message. Transmute was successful. Have captured one of them. It is taking me to the pick-up point in a land vehicle. (eyeing Jenny) I think I can control it by mastering its language, which is primitive and easy to learn. Will arrive on time. Wait for me. 
The STAR MAN opens his hands and, to Jenny's astonishment, the ball rises quickly and seeps through her roof without leaving a trace. 
EXT. INTERSTATE - NIGHT 
The Mustang swerves violently, then straightens itself as the ball comes through the roof and surges into the sky. 
EXT. SKY - NIGHT 
Unexpectedly, Shermin's helicopter storms into view. It is so close we can count the rivets. As it clears, we go to: 
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
The flow of traffic on the Interstate below is being fed into the six television screens from infrared cameras on the belly of the craft. The image on the screen under the master begins to move and ends in a close-up of a green Mustang. It's not Jenny's. With a buzz the red dot appears and Fox's face interrupts the view of the Mustang. 
FOX (V.O.) I just came from a meeting with the Security Council and (the picture breaks up, but the voice continues) in view of the extraterrestrial's radical change and the fact that all our efforts (the picture re- assembles) to contact its ship remain unanswered, it was decided to issue a ten state 'all points bulletin' for Scott Haydn, Jenny Haydn and the green Mustang. The officers have been instructed not to approach the people or the vehicle but to contact you. You will then move in and contain the subjects. 
Shermin rubs his hands over his face while he digests this. 
SHERMIN (sorting it out) You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over... 
FOX (V.O.) I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk. 
SHERMIN I don't like it, George... 
FOX (V.O.) Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed? 
SHERMIN It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed... 
FOX (V.O.) We don't know what else to do. We need results. 
SHERMIN (accepting) You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay. 
FOX (V.O.) I'm gonna be here if you need anything. 
His image is replaced by one of the highway. 
MAJOR BELL They're gonna let some local cop blow him away. 
LYMAN Save us all a lot of trouble. 
MAJOR BELL Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool. 
LYMAN Bullshit! 
MAJOR BELL You have no conception of this, do you? 
LYMAN You jerk! You look at all the sweetness and light and goodness you think'll come out of this. You know what's gonna come out of this... The end of religion, the end of civilization, the end of the earth. We could become slaves, we could become a colony of these things. Don't you see that? Are you too stupid to see that? 
SHERMIN Are you ladies through?... 
Bell and Lyman look at their feet. 
SHERMIN Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature. 
LYMAN Bell wants us to get down on our knees and bow. 
SHERMIN (to Bell) Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed? 
MAJOR BELL No... I guess we never thought it would happen. 
It's Shermin's turn to look at his feet. 
SHERMIN Terrific. 
On one of the screens behind him the camera has picked up a lighted billboard advertising 'Kellogg's Corn Flakes' with its slogan 'HAVE A GREAT DAY.' 
EXT. HIGHWAY - EARLY MORNING 
Jenny's Mustang is barreling along well over the speed limit. As it PASSES US, we PAN WITH it TO a sign: SLOW FOR INTERSECTION. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - EARLY MORNING 
JENNY I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you. 
The STAR MAN is unyielding. 
JENNY Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car. (she hands him some money) That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go. 
STAR MAN (taps the red dot on the satel compass) When we get here. 
Jenny slams herself angrily back in the seat. 
JENNY You bastard. 
Her upper lip trembles and, in spite of herself, she might cry. The STAR MAN sees the center lane is open. He checks his side mirror and drifts over, only to be caught by a light. The car is still rolling when Jenny makes her move. She throws open the door and, by the time the STAR MAN turns around, she is out and running. 
STAR MAN Jennyhaydn! 
He takes his foot off the brake to go after her and the car lurches into the cross traffic. He clambers back behind the wheel, regains control and cuts a hard right in front of the other car waiting at the light. 
EXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY 
Over her shoulder, Jenny can see the Mustang coming. She dodges up a brick walkway toward a J.C. Penney shopping mall. The Mustang skids to a stop at the curb. The STAR MAN jumps out in time to see Jenny push her way past a stream of pedestrian traffic and enter the mall. He leaves the car and zigzags through the people in that direction. 
INT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY 
As he barges in, the STAR MAN accidentally knocks a cup of Coke out of a YOUNG MAN's hand. 
YOUNG MAN Hey!! 
In a panic to find Jenny, he continues jostling past people to look in the shops that border the atrium. 
MEZZANINE 
Jenny warily approaches the railing and peers over. Below her the STAR MAN comes out of a record store. She turns away and gets on the escalator to the second floor. 
ON THE GROUND FLOOR 
The STAR MAN thinks he sees Jenny in an electronics store, but when the girl turns around, it is obviously not her. Backing out of there, he knocks over a sandwich board advertising a restaurant. The LOUD THWACK it makes when it hits the cement turns faces in his direction. 
Jenny's is not among them. His eyes raise to the mezzanine. Maybe she's there. He looks wildly around for a way up. He spots the escalator and, trying to keep the upper floor in view while he runs for it, he slams into an unattended pram. 
It begins to tip over. The BABY INSIDE SCREAMS. The STAR MAN manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the floor. He is looking for a place to put it when the MOTHER comes charging out of a plant store. 
MOTHER My baby!!! He's stealing my baby! Burt!! 
The STAR MAN holds the baby out to her. 
She grabs it out of his hands and he turns to leave. 
MOTHER Burt!! Somebody stop him!! He was stealing my baby!! 
Two tough-looking MEN in T-shirts step in to block the STAR MAN's way to the escalator. 
MAN Where you think you're going? 
Not understanding, the STAR MAN tries to get by them. They push him back. 
STAR MAN Please. 
A tall, skinny blond man with spectacles elbows his way to the Mother. 
MOTHER He was trying to steal Gloria. 
Two steps and Burt is on the STAR MAN. He spins him around. 
BURT Is that right? Huh? 
He throws him back against the crowd that has gathered. 
STAR MAN (stutters) Please. 
Burt pulls the STAR MAN up by his shirt front and shakes him. 
BURT Is that right? Come on. Answer me. 
Fear erases the STAR MAN's tenuous grasp of English and he begins to jabber in his own language. This makes Burt even madder. 
BURT Were you trying to steal my baby? Huh? Answer me! 
STAR MAN Jennyhaydn! 
SECOND FLOOR 
Jenny has just gotten on the escalator to the third floor when she hears her name. She knows she shouldn't but she gets off and joins the crowd at the railing. From there, she can see the STAR MAN trapped in a circle of people. He clubs Burt away from him and tries to thrash his way out of the mob. 
STAR MAN Jennyhaydn! 
One of the T-shirts throws him back and Burt begins to punch him. We MOVE IN UNTIL we are CLOSE ON Jenny's face. 
GROUND FLOOR 
JENNY Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take... (bends back second portion of ticket) ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'... 
STAR MAN (impatient) 'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike? 
JENNY You want this ticket? 
STAR MAN Yes. 
JENNY Then don't be smart. 
P.A. SYSTEM (V.O.) Last call for bus 33 to Vermillion, Sioux City and Omaha... loading at Gate 3. 
JENNY That's your bus. (picks up the map and folds it) When you get to Las Vegas, ask the driver. 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.' 
STAR MAN (falling into step next to her) 'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.' 
JENNY (hands him the map) You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike... (stops in the middle of the waiting area to illustrate) You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this... 
Jenny takes a few sweeps at an imaginary highway with her thumb. The stares this pantomime draws make the STAR MAN more nervous about the bus trip than he already is. 
JENNY Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride. 
STAR MAN The car will stop? 
JENNY (continuing toward the loading platform) Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen... 
The STAR MAN stops. 
STAR MAN When do I get to Lathrop Wells? 
JENNY Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and... 
Jenny pushes open a glass door to: 
EXT. LOADING PLATFORM - DAY 
JENNY ...you'll have plenty of time to get to where you want to go. 
The STAR MAN hangs back when he sees the security guards. 
JENNY Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on. (gives him ticket) Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it. 
STAR MAN Can I have the gun? 
JENNY No. 
She maneuvers him into the end of the line. 
JENNY You might need this. 
She takes some of the paper money out of her wallet and stuffs it in his pocket. 
JENNY Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay. 
STAR MAN (nervous) Yes. 
The line moves forward a step. 
JENNY Well... I'm going to go now. 
STAR MAN Go? 
JENNY Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... (takes his hand) Goodbye. 
STAR MAN Goodbye. 
He watches her walk away. 
STAR MAN Jennyhaydn. 
JENNY Yes? 
STAR MAN Please stay. 
Jenny comes back and takes his hand. 
JENNY I'll stay till you get on the bus. 
A family of four climbs aboard and the line moves up. The STAR MAN is alert to everything happening on the platform. Jenny sneaks him an affectionate look. No one in front of him has baggage to check and they move quickly past the DRIVER until the STAR MAN is next in line. 
DRIVER Ticket? 
The STAR MAN hands the Driver his ticket. The Driver rips out the first coupon and hands it back. 
JENNY See? You're going to be okay. 
When they stop at the door, she impulsively kisses him on the cheek. 
JENNY Goodbye. 
LYMAN Maybe he's turned her into one of them. They enter the crowd around the helicopter. 
EXT. INTERSTATE 29 - DAY 
The Mustang cruises along between fields of corn. 
JENNY (V.O.) Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth? 
STAR MAN (V.O.) It was a mistake. 
INT./EXT. MUSTANG - DAY 
The following conversation will be played over various views of Americana: a station wagon load of kids, waving and laughing, lovers kissing at a bus stop, billboards, car lots, a dog taking a leak against a tree, cheerleaders practicing on a football field, a funeral cortege, a telephone repairman up on a pole. 
JENNY You thought we were a different planet?! 
STAR MAN No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and... 
JENNY Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.' 
STAR MAN We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars. 
JENNY You did? That's funny. So did we. 
STAR MAN Yes? 
JENNY Yes. 
STAR MAN We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship... 
JENNY The captain... 
STAR MAN The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed. 
JENNY Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend? 
STAR MAN I don't understand 'friend.' 
JENNY A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with... 
STAR MAN He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship. 
JENNY The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us. 
STAR MAN I understand. 
JENNY Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home. 
STAR MAN What is hell? 
JENNY It's bad. 
STAR MAN He will. 
Pause. Jenny feels the STAR MAN staring at her. She turns to look at him. His gaze doesn't waver. She looks back at the road, then back at the STAR MAN. 
JENNY What are you doing? 
STAR MAN Are you my friend? 
JENNY Yes. 
STAR MAN (smiles) I am your friend. 
EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT 
Jenny's Mustang is whipping west out of Lincoln, Nebraska. We HEAR A JUMBLE OF RADIO STATIONS as the SELECTOR is RUN THROUGH THE FREQUENCIES. 
INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT 
Jenny is driving. The STAR MAN finds a RELIGIOUS STATION ON the RADIO. 
PREACHER (V.O.) (on radio) God is your creator. God is your master. God is you savior. God is the only reason that you exist. If God... 
STAR MAN (during the above) Who is God? 
Jenny is tired. She doesn't want to get into that. 
JENNY Nobody knows. 
STAR MAN Why? 
JENNY I don't know. 
The STAR MAN lets it drop and finds a COUNTRY AND WESTERN STATION. 
STAR MAN I like this music. 
JENNY I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying? 
INT. LAST PATROL CAR - NIGHT 
SECOND DRIVER All anybody knows is that they're armed and dangerous. 
In the office, he can see Jenny and the STAR MAN leave the counter and head for the door. He raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes for a good head-on look at them. 
THROUGH THE BINOCULARS 
We SEE Jenny and the STAR MAN come out of the motel office. 
BACK TO SCENE 
The Second Officer lowers the glasses and looks down at the telex pictures of Jenny and the STAR MAN taped to the dashboard. 
SECOND OFFICER Be a piece of cake for us to take 'em. 
INT. LEAD PATROL CAR - NIGHT 
THROUGH the WINDSHIELD, we can SEE Jenny and the STAR MAN approaching the Mustang. 
THIRD DRIVER National Security folks should be here any minute. Let them take care of it. That's what they get the big bucks for. 
EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT 
STAR MAN I want a drink. May I have two quarters? 
At the passenger door, Jenny sets her purse on the car roof to take out her wallet. 
JENNY (handing it to him) You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you. 
STAR MAN On the radio they say it's good. 
JENNY Hurry up. 
Over her purse she notices the patrol car facing her from the restaurant parking lot. There is certainly nothing unusual about a patrol car in a restaurant parking lot. She shrugs it off and gets in the Mustang. 
INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT 
Jenny's behind hasn't even hit the seat before she sees the patrol car parked on the frontage road off to her left. She looks at the STAR MAN. He's busy pounding on the drink machine. She turns around to check the lot behind her and spots the patrol car there. 
STAR MAN (coming to the car with a drink can in each hand) The machine gave me two. Should I put one back? 
JENNY No. Get in. 
STAR MAN (rounding the hood) You can have one. 
JENNY (as he gets in) I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer. 
The STAR MAN stiffens when he sees the patrol car on the frontage road. 
STAR MAN Are you angry at me? 
JENNY No. I'm just not tired. Let's go. 
EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT 
The Mustang moves toward the frontage road. 
INT. LAST PATROL CAR - NIGHT 
SECOND DRIVER (as the Mustang rolls onto the frontage road) They made us. Let's get 'em. 
EXT. BEST WESTERN MOTEL - NIGHT 
All three patrol cars jam on their rack lights and, with their SIRENS HOWLING, peel out after Jenny and the STAR MAN. 
INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT 
At the SOUND, the STAR MAN snaps his attention to the rear view mirror. It's ablaze with police lights. He tromps on the gas. 
JENNY No. 
INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
Shermin is patched into the Nebraska Highway Patrol and is listening to the pursuit. 
EXT. INTERSTATE 80 - NIGHT 
The Mustang careens down the on-ramp and squeezes into the traffic a hair's breath ahead of an 18-wheeler. This cuts off the patrol cars momentarily, but the Mustang doesn't have the speed to stay ahead of them. Using the other cars on the road as shields, the STAR MAN dodges from lane to lane trying to keep the police from coming alongside. 
INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT 
The lead patrol car feints forward on the STAR MAN's side. The STAR MAN sways over to cut it off and the middle patrol car slips in next to Jenny. The STAR MAN grabs the gun from under the seat. 
JENNY No!!! No!!! 
INT. MIDDLE PATROL CAR - NIGHT 
DRIVER He's got a gun!! 
Standing on the rim of the gorge, the STAR MAN sees the rays of his pursuers' flashlights choking off any possible escape. He eases Jenny to the ground behind a boulder. She whimpers with the pain. 
STAR MAN (strokes her cheek) You will be all right. 
He stretches over the top of the boulder and scatters FOUR SHOTS at the lights. 
EXT. TREES - NIGHT 
The patrolmen, the technicians and Shermin all hit the ground and kill their lights. 
SHERMIN Mrs. Haydn, we don't want to hurt you. Put down your gun and come out. We just want to talk to your friend. 
THE STAR MAN AND JENNY 
The STAR MAN peers around the boulder. At that instant the searchlight from the helicopter happens to splash across the men in the field. He sees that their guns are drawn and pointed in his direction. The STAR MAN pulls back and takes a marble from his pouch. It grows and glows gold as the STAR MAN rolls it between his palms. When it reaches the size of a baseball, he clutches it firmly in his right hand and EMPTIES the .45 toward Shermin and the police. This time, there is a BARRAGE OF ANSWERING FIRE. 
With the BULLETS RICOCHETING around him, the STAR MAN lifts Jenny to his shoulder. He massages the golden orb until it becomes the size of a soccer ball, then takes two quick steps to the edge of the cliff and leaps into the abyss. 
EXT. ABYSS - NIGHT 
The upward thrust of the ball supports their fall and under its glow they begin a slow descent to the other side of the river. Above them, the helicopter dips back and locks its searchlight on the shelf of boulders they just left. 
EXT. PLAIN - NIGHT 
The STAR MAN sets down with the smoothness of a man stepping off an escalator. He looks over his shoulder. The helicopter is still concentrating its spotlight on the ridge. He speaks to the ball in his language. 
STAR MAN (subtitles) Iron channel message. Almost caught by pursuers. This may hinder escape. Wait for me. 
He lets the ball go and, with even more velocity than the others, it zips into the sky. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. TRUCK STOP - NIGHT 
A WOMAN in a Frederick's of Hollywood negligee lets a TRUCK DRIVER out of one of the Winnebagos parked to the side of the main building. 
WOMAN Don't forget to tell the boys where you had a good time. 
DRIVER (calling back to her) You weren't that good. 
Her rusty laugh follows him into the parking lot. He walks between the trucks to a semi which has half of a pre-fab mobile home tied onto its flat-bed. The polyethylene that covers the open side of the house flaps in the WIND at the lower corner next to the cab. The Driver opens his door. He takes out a staple gun and refastens the dark green plastic to the house frame. 
INT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT 
In the middle of the empty bedroom, the STAR MAN tries to cushion Jenny against the sudden JOLTS made by the semi as it lumbers out of the parking lot. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT 
With the Driver taking it smoothly through the gears, the semi picks up speed. 
INT. HALF HOUSE - NIGHT 
The STAR MAN moves Jenny into a rectangle of moonlight shaped on the floor by a high, wide window and strips off her blouse. 
The cold light marbles Jenny's skin and makes the blood from her wounds appear black. With her blouse, the STAR MAN wipes away the blood on the right side of her head and neck. He finds a deep glass cut on her cheek and two entry points in her neck. He concentrates on her cheek and we can SEE the glow of his brain through his human skin. 
A bit of the white light comes out of his forehead. It tumbles across to Jenny's cheek and settles into the wound. The STAR MAN watches intently as one end of the wound flares brightly for an instant, then dies. The flesh left behind has been closed without a scar. 
A larger piece of light drops out of his forehead into what's left of the gash. With that area suffused in a healing glow, he shifts his focus to the pellet holes on her neck. He sends two pieces of light plunging into the wounds. Immediately, they spread into halos which we can SEE radiating from under the skin. 
Out of the night comes a LONG BLAST ON the AIR HORN and the STAR MAN has to steady Jenny as the truck swerves around something in the highway. 
When it settles back into its ride, the STAR MAN wipes the blood off Jenny's shoulder. The beams of the passing cars through the plastic catch the fatigue on the STAR MAN's face as he works over Jenny. 
EXT. HIGHWAY 76 - NIGHT 
With its pre-fab house, the semi rumbles through Julesburg, Sterling and Ft. Morgan. By the time it gets to Denver, dawn is beginning to color the tips of the Rocky Mountains. 
INT. HALF HOUSE - DAWNBREAK 
It's still dark in here. With a chunk of light in his left hand, the STAR MAN dabs at the last of Jenny's wounds, leaving behind a phosphorescent bandage. More of these patches glimmer up and down her right side. He checks her over to see if he's missed a wound. He hasn't. 
He covers her with his windbreaker and, exhausted by his efforts, sits back against the wall. He waits to see that Jenny is sleeping comfortably, then presses the palms of his hands together. The satel compass appears between them. The green dot tells him he is still on course. 
EXT. INTERSTATE - SUNRISE 
Colorado Highway PATROLMEN are dropping orange fluorescent cones across two of the three westbound lanes to form a roadblock. The sound of a harmonica draws us to Shermin's helicopter parked in a meadow beside the road. 
EXT. HELICOPTER - SUNRISE 
As the radio technician plays the harmonica, Lyman clangs down the steps and bends to wake Shermin who is sacked out under the fuselage. 
SHERMIN Tell him I'm not here. 
LYMAN I did. 
Shermin sighs and rolls over on his back. He looks terrible. 
SHERMIN Get me a radio. At least I won't have to look at his face. 
A passing car TAKES US TO the STAR MAN as he runs along the shoulder to a maroon and white '57 Chevy that has pulled off to pick him up. 
EXT. '57 CHEVY - DAY 
A swarthy, bald MAN with hairy arms leans across the seat. 
MAN Where are you going? 
STAR MAN Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English. 
MAN Hop in. 
INT. '57 CHEVY - DAY 
MAN (re-entering the flow of traffic) I can only take you to Grand Junction, but you'll have a better chance to get a ride from there. 
The STAR MAN smiles. 
MAN Where you from? 
The STAR MAN starts to point to the sky, then catches himself. 
STAR MAN I don't understand. 
MAN Parlez vous Francais?... Habla Ingles?... Sprechen zie deutsch? 
These are foreign words to the STAR MAN and he pastes on his smile. 
MAN Good job, neither do I. What do you do for a living? 
STAR MAN (pretending) I don't understand. 
MAN I'm a cook. Do you understand 'cook?' 
STAR MAN No. 
COOK (MAN) Food. Eat. I prepare food. I work as a cook. That's how I make money. 
STAR MAN I understand. 
COOK What do you do? 
STAR MAN (searches for an answer, then) I make maps. 
COOK Hey, that sounds interesting. You like it? 
STAR MAN Eh... yes. 
COOK Make any money? 
STAR MAN No. 
COOK (takes a pack of Camels out of his pocket) You don't get rich as a cook, either, believe me. I got a girl going to college this fall. The wife had to go back to nursing to help pay for it. 
He sticks a cigarette in his mouth and flips one up for the STAR MAN. 
COOK Smoke? 
The STAR MAN takes it, quickly examines it, then positions it in his mouth at the exact angle the Cook did. His eyebrows raise when the Cook flicks his Bic and puffs an ash on the end of his cigarette. 
The butane flame is swung in his direction and he flinches back before allowing the Cook to singe his Camel. He copies the Cook's puffing and the end of his cigarette begins to glow. 
COOK She wants to become a doctor. She's a bright kid. Hard worker. I think she'll make it. But the damned inflation's driven the tuition up so high it makes it real tough on a family like ours. 
The Cook inhales deeply from his cigarette and blows smoke at the windshield. The STAR MAN mimics the inhalation, then chokes. His eyes bulge and his cheeks puff out as he tries to be cool and not cough. The Cook takes no notice of his struggles. 
COOK I got two other kids. I don't know what we'll do when they get old enough for college. 
Smoke starts to dribble out of the Star Man's nose and mouth. Puzzled, he re-examines his cigarette. 
COOK Everybody blames it on the oil crisis. That might be where it starts. But I think a lot of people are just using that as an excuse to rip the rest of us off. I see it every day in the kitchen. Peaches. We use the gallon cans. The price has gone up three times in the last year. And now the cans are only half full. 
The Cook takes another drag. As if etiquette required it, the STAR MAN hurries to copy him. This time there are no ill effects. 
COOK Do you have children? 
STAR MAN No. 
COOK They're damned expensive and a pain in the ass sometimes, but I wouldn't trade having them for anything. 
The Cook flicks his ash out of the window. A moment later, the STAR MAN mirrors his action. 
COOK What do you think of America? 
STAR MAN It is beautiful. 
EXT. ELMO'S - DAY 
A truck stop set back as little as the law allows from the BUZZ OF INTERSTATE 70. 
SHERMIN This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn? 
INT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH 
JENNY I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home. 
SHERMIN (V.O.) You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home. 
JENNY No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
The Technician hands Shermin a note which reads: ELMO"S TRUCK STOP/ABOUT 30 MILES EAST. 
JENNY (V.O.) I only called to tell you I was free and not to shoot anybody I was with if you see me. 
Shermin jabs his thumb upward, indicating that the helicopter should lift off. 
SHERMIN Is the man who kidnapped you there now? 
JENNY (V.O.) I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home. 
SHERMIN (his hand over the mouthpiece) Get a highway patrol unit over there. 
EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY 
Shermin's helicopter lifts off. 
SHERMIN (V.O.) Mrs. Haydn, I'm going to have to ask you to stay where you are. 
INT. SIT-DOWN PHONE BOOTH 
A sharp rap on the glass startles Jenny and she turns around to see her ride. 
OLDER MAN Ready? 
Jenny holds up a finger that asks for a moment longer on the phone. 
JENNY (into phone) Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again? 
SHERMIN (V.O.) Marc Shermin. 
JENNY Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book. 
SHERMIN (V.O.) Do you know what you were kidnapped by? 
Pause. 
SHERMIN (V.O.) Mrs. Haydn... 
JENNY He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone. 
SHERMIN (V.O.) Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells? 
This hits Jenny like a kick in the stomach. She leans her head back against the wall. Her ride is pacing outside the booth. 
SHERMIN (V.O.) What's he planning to do in Lathrop Wells? Is he meeting someone there? 
Jenny smashes the receiver back in its cradle and throws open the door. 
JENNY (on her way past the weathered driver) I changed my mind. Thanks. 
She rushes down the hallway to the dining area where again she stands just inside the entrance. 
JENNY (at the top of her lungs) It's me again... 
The place goes quiet except for a smattering of laughter. 
JENNY I need a fast ride west. 
INT. PORSCHE - DAY 
The speedometer reads 90. The driver, a bespectacled, pimply- faced SIXTEEN YEAR OLD, shifts into fifth gear. Jenny is harnessed in the passenger seat. Chatter from a CB under the dash COMPETES WITH ROCK N' ROLL ON THE TAPE DECK. 
JENNY You sure this is your car? 
TEENAGER (with a stutter) My grandmother's rich. 
JENNY (as they come up on a station wagon) Slow down, slow down. 
TEENAGER Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going. 
But he downshifts. The Porsche is going a mere 80 when they pass the station wagon. 
JENNY (peering at its occupants) I told you I'm looking for someone. 
TEENAGER In the cars, too?! 
JENNY I don't know where he is. 
TEENAGER Fly. 
Jenny gives him a withering look. 
TEENAGER The five-fifty. We already passed it. But it'll take him way out of his way. 
JENNY Pull over. I've got to get back there. 
TEENAGER Why wouldn't he want to go through the roadblock?... What did you guys do?... I won't tell anybody. 
JENNY It's easier not to tell if you don't know. 
EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY 
The Porsche slows to a stop on the shoulder. 
TEENAGER (as Jenny opens the door) Wait. Could I have your autograph? 
JENNY Sure. 
She leans back and gives the startled Teenager a kiss on the mouth, then gets out. 
TEENAGER I have nothing to do. I'd like to help you. 
JENNY Don't worry. I'll be all right. 
She closes the door. The Teenager takes a last look at her before pulling back on the highway. Jenny waits for a car in the slow lane to go by, then runs across to the line and waits for cars in the fast lane to go by. 
INT. ROADRUNNER - DAY 
The STAR MAN spots Jenny standing on the line peering into the on-coming cars for signs of him. He becomes agitated and his mouth begins to move soundlessly. There is a break in the traffic and Jenny dashes to the center divider. The STAR MAN leans across his driver and yells as the Roadrunner plunges by her. 
STAR MAN JENNYHAYDN!!! 
EXT. INTERSTATE - DAY 
Jenny spins around to see the Roadrunner skid to a stop on the shoulder and the STAR MAN get out. A motorcycle bombs by. He starts across the lanes of traffic toward Jenny. A truck blasts past him in the slow lane. He is buffeted into the fast lane. Jenny runs down the center divider to meet him. A VW honks, its tires squeal on the pavement as it swerves around him. He reaches the safety of the center divider. Jenny throws her arms around him and lays her head against his chest. He stands there uncomfortably not knowing how to respond to this human emotion. 
STAR MAN I told you goodbye. Why are you here? 
JENNY The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back. 
STAR MAN This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back. 
JENNY The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on. 
She grabs his wrist but he hangs back. 
STAR MAN If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me. 
JENNY Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise. 
STAR MAN I will go. But not you. 
JENNY You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did. 
STAR MAN I don't want you to be hurt. 
JENNY Come on. 
Holding the STAR MAN's hand, Jenny pulls him toward the road. 
JENNY I didn't ask to come along on this trip, but I sure as hell am going to be the one to say when I get off. 
They bolt across the lanes of traffic to the other side of the road where she flags down an old black pickup truck. She says something to the driver and she and the STAR MAN climb into the back. As the truck returns to the highway, the CLACK OF AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER OVERPOWERS the TRAFFIC SOUNDS. 
EXT. SKY - DAY 
Shermin's helicopter slices around a pine-dotted peak following the twists of Interstate 70 below. In the near distance, we can SEE the roadblock. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
Unnoticed by Shermin or the Technicians, the black pickup passes off the television screens carrying their quarry east. 
SHERMIN (into headset) Any sign of either of them yet? 
The roadblock appears on the television screens. 
EXT. ROADBLOCK - DAY 
Lyman, wearing a headset plugged into a belt pack, is walking down the line of cars. 
LYMAN I don't think they're going to show. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
A swift kick from Shermin sends a stool clanging into a bulkhead. The Technicians won't meet his eyes when he turns back to them. 
SHERMIN Okay. Tell the highway patrol to block all major arteries off 70 from here to Elmo's. 
Jenny and the STAR MAN are following the tracks to an abandoned boxcar. 
INT. BOXCAR - DUSK 
The STAR MAN climbs in and pulls Jenny after him. Jenny is shivering badly. 
JENNY Can you close the door? 
The STAR MAN scrapes it forward. He activates the satel compass which lights the interior of the boxcar. While he is doing this Jenny turns her back to him and takes off her jacket. Her teeth chattering, she tries to wring the water out of it. 
STAR MAN You are cold. 
JENNY You're damn right I am. 
STAR MAN I do not get cold. 
Clutching the windbreaker to her breasts, Jenny looks at the STAR MAN over her shoulder. It doesn't take her long to make up her mind. 
JENNY (crossing to him) Open your shirt. 
She waits while he struggles with the buttons. After two she brushes away his hands and undoes the rest. She lets the windbreaker drop and, slipping her arms around his waist, presses her bare chest against his. 
JENNY (savoring it) Oh, you're warm... put your arms around me. 
The STAR MAN does and Jenny jumps as the wet sleeves touch her back. 
JENNY Take your shirt off. 
It is difficult with Jenny around his waist, but he manages. He drapes his arms over her. She snuggles into him. The RAIN POUNDS ON THE ROOF. Gradually, Jenny responds to the STAR MAN's warmth and relaxes. She lifts her head off his chest and looks at him. 
STAR MAN What? 
JENNY Nothing. 
She brushes her lips against his. The STAR MAN's not sure what's happening. But he's not offended. Her next kiss is full and long. He accepts it with his eyes open and when she eases back he leans in for more. Jenny responds. As if on command, the satel compass comes from around behind the STAR MAN to hover in back of Jenny. He takes it between his palms and extinguishes it. 
INT. BOXCAR - MORNING 
Jenny awakens and looks around. The STAR MAN is not with her. As she stands up she hears his VOICE OUTSIDE. He is speaking to something in his language. 
She goes to the door to find out what and sees him standing beside a fenced-in pasture talking to the horses inside. 
EXT. PASTURE - MORNING 
Jenny joins the STAR MAN at the fence. 
JENNY Good morning. 
STAR MAN Horses. 
JENNY You don't forget anything, do you? 
STAR MAN No. 
Jenny pets one of the horses on the nose. 
JENNY (to the horse) Hello... hello. How are you this morning? 
STAR MAN Do they talk?! 
JENNY (laughs) No, they don't talk... We talk to them. 
STAR MAN I understand. 
An appaloosa nudges her way through the others to the fence. 
JENNY Oh, you're pretty... 
STAR MAN I gave you a baby last night. 
Shocked, Jenny looks at him from around the appaloosa's nose. The STAR MAN is combing a horse's mane with his fingers and he doesn't see her expression. 
STAR MAN (meaning the horses) They are beautiful. 
JENNY Yes, they are. 
STAR MAN You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. (turns to face her) You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one. 
JENNY (shakes her head 'no') But... 
STAR MAN It will be human and it will look like this. (touches his face) But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have. 
JENNY I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby. 
STAR MAN You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now. 
Jenny comes over and puts her arms around the STAR MAN. 
JENNY I want it. 
The STAR MAN shaves the rubber off the electrical lines leading into the fuse box and clips two wires of his own onto the exposed copper. With Jenny watching we have a montage of the STAR MAN working through the night: modifying the insides of the Black and Decker drill, cutting out the mid- section above the trigger, fitting electrical components into that area, screwing a pipe into the bit-clamp, welding it together with the spark that arcs between the electrical wires. 
INT. OFFICE (GAS STATION) - NIGHT 
Jenny folds a sheaf of money into a sheet of yellow paper and props it on the cash register. 'For Damages. Thank You' is scribbled on the front. She runs out to catch the STAR MAN who is on his way to the Camaro. 
EXT. CAMARO - NIGHT 
Carrying the modified Black and Decker drill the STAR MAN opens the driver's door. 
JENNY Where do you think you're going? 
STAR MAN Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now. 
JENNY I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye. 
INT. CAMARO - NIGHT 
Both hands on the wheel, Jenny is burning down the center line. The STAR MAN bends two thin wires trailing out from the grip of the drill. Jenny winces as he buries them into the flesh on either side of his left wrist. The car skates around the corner of a low hill. They can see that the Cobra is still sitting next to the road. 
JENNY (glancing at the modified drill) I hope that works. 
The STAR MAN is lost in concentration. 
Jenny kills her lights and glues the accelerator to the floor. Three MEN scramble from the helicopter with M16s. A BURST OF SLUGS RIPS THROUGH the Camaro's WINDSHIELD. The STAR MAN leans out the passenger window and with an other-worldly scream, fires. The helicopter is BLOWN TO SMITHEREENS. The concussion throws the men to the ground. 
EXT. BURNING HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
The Camaro whizzes through the falling DEBRIS. 
INT. CAMARO - NIGHT 
JENNY It works. 
The STAR MAN slumps in exhaustion and pain. 
STAR MAN I do not know how many times I can do this. 
INT. SHERMIN'S HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
It is filled with the radio voices of the Cobra crews setting up to attack the Camaro. 
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
The Camaro becomes airborne at the crest of a dip. Only its new shocks save the landing. 
INT. CAMARO - NIGHT 
The STAR MAN draws the satel compass out between his palms. The green dot now covers the right half of the red dot. He presses his palms together and looks past Jenny at the rugged foothills. 
The first light of day is starting to color the sky behind them. Jenny and the STAR MAN are startled by the DRUMMING WHOMP OF A HELICOPTER. The STAR MAN looks out the window for its source. He can't see anything. The SOUND FADES. In a moment, it is REPEATED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAR and AGAIN IT FADES. 
STAR MAN If my ship is not here, we are in trouble. 
This is a truism that Jenny doesn't want to hear and she flexes her fingers on the wheel. 
STAR MAN (points at a distinctive cone peak) That's where we landed last time. Right under that mountain. 
Jenny and the STAR MAN steady themselves for the last leg of their journey. Suddenly, their silence is exploded by a COBRA dropping out of the sky in front of them. Its searchlight bangs into their faces and, with its thirty-calibre MACHINE GUNS BLAZING, it comes straight at them. 
Jenny yanks the Camaro onto the shoulder. The SLUGS CHEW UP the asphalt beside it. She fishtails back onto the road. A SECOND COBRA surprises them from the STAR MAN's side. Its MACHINE GUN KNOCKS OUT the BACK WINDOW before he can FIRE. 
The STAR MAN crawls over his seat and arranges himself in the hole that was the back window to meet the Cobras' next FIRING RUN. It doesn't take them long. The first two have been joined by a THIRD. They swoop down on the Camaro. 
INT. LEAD HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
The gunsights lock on the car below. The CO-PILOT squeezes the trigger. 
EXT. CAMARO - NIGHT 
SHOTS THUMP INTO the trunk in front of the STAR MAN and he FIRES. The lead HELICOPTER ERUPTS, raining pieces of hot metal over the desert floor. The other helicopters are jarred out of their run and their BULLETS harmlessly KICK UP SAND on the shoulder. Before they can regroup, the STAR MAN BLOWS THEM OUT OF THE SKY. 
JENNY In front!!! In front!!! 
The STAR MAN has to hang on as Jenny dodges the car out of the path of a Cobra skimming over the highway toward them. As it goes over, he is able to get off a SHOT directly INTO its UNDERBELLY. The BALL OF FLAME almost engulfs the Camaro. 
INT. CAMARO - NIGHT 
The STAR MAN slumps down into the back seat breathing hard. Jenny looks over her shoulder at him and is shocked at the strain that shows on his face. 
JENNY Hang on. 
She throws the car into a skid and leaves the blacktop for a dirt road winding between two low hills. 
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT 
At the base of a sandstone cliff, the Camaro slides to a stop. Jenny helps the STAR MAN out. She supports him as they struggle toward the protection of the boulders. Fox's Cobra roars over the hill. 
INT. COBRA - NIGHT

JENNIFER'S BODY 
Written by 
Diablo Cody 
INT. LEECH LAKE WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL HOSPITAL - DAY 
ANITA "NEEDY" LESNICKI, 17, sits on her hospital bed in pajamas. She's a plain-faced girl with a haunted expression. As she stares out the window, she winds colored yarn around a pair of Popsicle sticks to create a "god's eye." 
Out a single window, we see an imposing nine-foot SECURITY FENCE. 
Next to Needy, we see a pile of unopened mail scattered casually on the floor. There are letters, packages, even creepy little gifts and totems sent by admiring "fans." 
NEEDY V.O. Every day, I get letters. I think I get more letters than Santa Claus, Zac Efron and Dr. Phil combined. I'm kind of the shit. 
RAYMUNDO, a counselor raps on the door and sticks his head in cautiously. 
RAYMUNDO Rec time in five minutes, Needy. 
NEEDY Grassy-ass, Raymundo. 
Needy stands up and begins changing into an institutional gym uniform. As she slips off her pajamas, we can see a series of puffy, slash-like SCARS on her body. 
NEEDY V.O. Sometimes the letters are from people who say they're praying for me. They tell me everything will be okay if I just accept Jesus Christ into my heart. I say the words, but nothing ever happens. Nobody comes back. Nobody gets off the cross. 
She glances sadly at a PHOTO OF A BOY on her dresser. She touches the frame wistfully, her eyes full of remorse. 
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) Occasionally I get presents from starfuckers who saw my picture in the paper and want to marry me or something. They think they can take me away from all this. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) Like I'd really date some perverted Chester with a hard-on for jailbait. I might be insane, but I'm not desperate. 
We see a morbid "hall of fame" of creepy photos sent in from guys. They line the mirror, grinning at us. There's even a DICK SHOT tucked in there. 
Needy pulls on her threadbare uniform T-shirt. It hangs down to her knees, covering her shorts. 
FEMALE COP At least we've already got a confession. NEEDY Confessions are for pussies. You've got a declaration, Grace. She giggles maniacally. Roman turns on the radio, violating protocol. It's a soaring rock anthem-- the SAME SONG we heard being piped into solitary confinement. 
Both cops BRIGHTEN when they hear the song. Roman cranks the volume. ROMAN God, I love this song. FEMALE COP I know. And they've done so much for this town. 
ROMAN They're way more than a band, really. They're heroes. FEMALE COP Wait, this is my favorite part... Roman and the female cop begin to sing along with the uplifting, corny song: 
FEMALE COP AND ROMAN (in unison) "Through the trees, I will find you. Heal the ruins left inside you. And the stars will remind you, that you are home..." 
Needy stares out the window at the sun creeping up over the forest on the horizon. NEEDY V.O. So I killed her. Whatever. It won't undo anything. Three pulses-- three lives-- all stopped cold by adolescent bloodlust. It's hard to believe that just two months ago, me, Jennifer and my boyfriend Chip were completely normal people. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) We were our yearbook pictures. Nothing more, nothing less. 
We see a brief montage of black-and-white yearbook stills: JENNIFER executing the splits on a football field, her smile bright. NEEDY inspecting a school newspaper layout, pen in hand, glasses on her nose. And finally, CHIP DOVE, playing a strap-on snare drum at a school pep rally, his head bent in concentration.... 
NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) Jesus, Chip.. 
The photo fades into the pep rally itself. CHIP is animated, drumming in full color... 
INT. KETTLE HIGH - DAY CHIP drums on the sidelines of the Devil's Kettle High basketball court. The stands are packed with BORED STUDENTS for a pep rally. Chip is 16, clean cut, and an awful drummer. NEEDY V.O. Chip couldn't drum for shit. He only knew "Land of a Thousand Dances" and the solo from "Wipeout." Lucky for him, the pep band gig wasn't too demanding. 
Sure enough, the band is playing "Land of a Thousand Dances." Nearby, the FLAG TEAM claps with gloved hands, picking up their flags for a choreographed stunt. 
Jennifer steps forward in her flag team uniform, breathtakingly beautiful. She hoists her flag aloft, twirling it. Time FREEZES as the flag unfurls. NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) If you can believe it, that's Jennifer. Yeah, the same girl I iced with the box-cutter. Only back then, we were tight. Sisters, practically. People found it hard to believe that a babe like Jennifer would associate with a dork like me. But we'd been the Wonder Twins since we were practically preverbal. Sandbox love never dies. 
Jennifer finishes her maneuver and WAVES to the stands. Needy waves back at her excitedly from the bleachers, small and owlish with glasses and lank hair. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHASTITY, a similarly geeky-looking girl standing next to Needy, rolls her eyes at this display of affection. CHASTITY You're totally lesbigay. NEEDY What? She's my best friend. The geeky girl mockingly imitates Needy's excited wave. CHASTITY You stare at her like you want to dry hump her. Needy ignores her. CHASTITY (CONT'D) Like, hump her through pants. NEEDY (INTERRUPTING) Are you jealous? 
CHASTITY Of what? That rich bitch? NEEDY She's not rich. 
INT. KETTLE HIGH HALLWAY - AFTER SCHOOL Needy digs through her locker, carefully selecting textbooks to take home. Jennifer skips up to her, smiling. JENNIFER Hey, Monistat. NEEDY What's up, Vagisil? JENNIFER You and me are going out tonight. 
She checks herself out in Needy's locker mirror. NEEDY Tonight? Why? JENNIFER Soft Shoulder are playing at the Carousel. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: JENNIFER (CONT'D) And it's all-ages, for once, which means I won't have to play Hello Titty with the door guy. NEEDY What's Soft Shoulder? 
NEEDY Wow. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JENNIFER You're lucky you get to ride with me to the club in style! She does a sexy little dance in the doorway, then notices CHIP. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Oh, hi Chip. Do you like puppies? She grabs her boobs and thrusts her chest outward at him, giggling. Needy watches jealously and MANEUVERS HER WAY IN FRONT OF JENNIFER. CHIP I think you forgot, like, two buttons. 
NEEDY I think she remembered two buttons. 
Jennifer sniffs the air. JENNIFER It smells like Thai food in here. (BEAT) Have you guys been fucking? NEEDY You're gross! 
She shoves Jennifer and they begin wrestling playfully. CHIP slumps against the wall, staring awestruck at Jennifer's cleavage. JENNIFER Okay, let's go to the club. The three of them shuffle onto the porch. Needy locks the door. CHIP The Carousel is not a club. JENNIFER Eat my ass, Chip. You're just jello `cause you're not invited. CHIP I'm not jello! That place is gross. Everyone there has a mustache. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JENNIFER You're totally jello! You're lime green jello and you can't even admit it. The girls scamper toward the car. 
CHIP (calling after them) Stop kidnapping my girlfriend! 
INT. THE CAROUSEL - NIGHT THE CAROUSEL is a run-down tavern at the edge of town, the kind with NASCAR posters, wobbly chairs and strands of plastic pennants crisscrossing the ceiling. It's a busy night and the bar is teeming with locals. A bartender sells a CASE OF BEER to a customer and passes it over the bar. NEEDY V.O. Chip was right. The Carousel is definitely not a club. Clubs are for attractive people in populous urban areas. Clubs have DJs and champagne and separate bathrooms for guys and girls. All we have is a broken jukebox, a few domestic taps and the Sticker Toilet. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - SAME We see a lone, nasty-looking TOILET covered in BAND STICKERS. BACK ON NEEDY: Needy and Jennifer enter the bar. Every guy in the joint stares at Jennifer, who snaps her "MINOR" wristband distastefully. JENNIFER God, I can't wait until I'm old enough to get wasted. Have you ever had peach schnapps? 
NEEDY I don't think so. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JENNIFER Peach schnapps are excellent. They even taste good when they come out of your nose mid-puke. A teenage guy, CRAIG, passes by and waves. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) Dirk, what about her? DIRK (gesturing to Needy) Who, Training Bra Jones? 
Needy looks offended. NIKOLAI No, the hot one. The one who just walked away. She's it, man. She's exactly what we're looking for. DIRK You're sure she's... NIKOLAI She's a kid. We're in God's country, man. Everyone out here's a fundie bible-banger. Of course she's a virgin. Dirk hesitates. NIKOLAI (CONT'D) Dirk, we didn't haul our asses out to this corn palace for nothing! DIRK Fine. Okay. You know, I know I'm not "just the bassist." I'm a person who happens to play the bass guitar. And I would like some respect... 
Nikolai is already ignoring him. Needy, alarmed, emerges from her hiding place and discreetly rushes over to the bar where Jennifer is arguing with a jealous-looking Roman. He shakes his head in disgust and leaves the bar. Jennifer walks over holding an ostentatious PATRIOTIC THEMED DRINK. She laughs when she sees Needy's concerned expression. JENNIFER What? Are you scared of rock stars too? NEEDY Those guys are rank, Jen. Just forget about it. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (6) 
JENNIFER I think the singer wants me. NEEDY Only because he thinks you're a virgin. I heard them talking. 
JENNIFER Yeah, right! I'm not even a backdoor-virgin anymore, thanks to Roman. By the way, that hurts. I couldn't even go to flags the next day. I had to stay home and sit on a bag of frozen peas. NEEDY Oh my God. 
JENNIFER Well, if Nikolai wants innocent, I can do innocent. I'll be Little Miss Fucking Sunshine. NEEDY He's way too old for you. JENNIFER Don't cock-block me, Needy. 
Piercing FEEDBACK signals the beginning of the set. Nikolai takes the mic and smiles broadly. NIKOLAI Good evening, Devil's Lake. Someone in the back shouts "Devil's Kettle!" NIKOLAI (CONT'D) Sorry. Anyway, we're Soft Shoulder. And we just want to make you happy. He WINKS at Jennifer. The band launch into the same intense, soaring song we heard in the COP CAR and the HOLE. Jennifer's eyes never leave Nikolai's. She's hypnotized, clinging to Needy's arm. Even the locals look charmed. Suddenly, a lick of FLAME appears on the wood paneling next to the stage. Needy is the first to notice. As she watches in horror, the fire is reflected in her glasses. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (7) 
The flames quickly climbs up to the ceiling and begin to blaze uncontrollably. People SCREAM and scatter. Someone ineffectually tries to throw a pitcher of beer on the fire. Nikolai turns and sees the fire spreading. He and Chas exchange glances. The BASS PLAYER pitches his guitar aside and jumps off the stage, and the drummer abandons his kit. Nikolai seems perfectly cool and composed as he watches from the stage...is he smiling? CHAOS. Everyone is trying to get out of the bar at once, causing a stampede. A woman's clothes and hair CATCH FIRE and she falls to her knees. We see a BEAM fall from the roof, nearly killing AHMET FROM INDIA. Jennifer stands still in a dreamlike state. 
NEEDY (to Jennifer) I know where to go! Needy grabs Jennifer by the elbow and pulls her into the tiny BATHROOM. Choking on smoke, they climb onto the Sticker Toilet (which now sports a giant SOFT SHOULDER sticker on the tank) and boost each other out the BATHROOM WINDOW. Hundreds are still trapped inside, screaming. 
EXT. THE CAROUSEL- CONTINUOUS Jennifer collapses in Needy's arms, coughing. Needy hugs her fiercely, almost romantically. She cups Jennifer's flushed face and looks into her eyes. 
JENNIFER (DAZED) It's so hot, Needy. I think I'm on fire. Oh God, I'm burning! 
NEEDY You're okay, I promise. You got burned worse when you wore that tin-foil bikini to the beach. Everything's fine. Suddenly, a HAND clamps onto Jennifer's shoulder. Both girls jump. It's Nikolai, his forehead creased with false concern. NIKOLAI Are you girls all right? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Needy is less than thrilled to see him. NEEDY We're great. Maybe you should try to find your band? NIKOLAI Those guys? They were the first ones out the door. Ran for the van like a bunch of Marys. Frankly, I'm ashamed of them. Needy narrows her eyes suspiciously. Muffled SCREAMS rise up from the flame-engulfed building. Jennifer covers her ears and cowers, sweat rolling down her face. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) God, it feels like hell out here. Come and hang with us in the van for a while, just until they hose this place down. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Jennifer is standing in the dark hallway, looking ghostly pale and smiling. Her clothes are tattered and stained-- her entire front is soaked in blood. Her makeup is smeared, and her eyes are bruised and sunken like a zombie's. She looks HORRIFYING, especially with that ghastly, clownish grin. 
NEEDY Um, Jennifer? Jennifer says nothing and continues to smile with blood- tinged teeth. NEEDY (CONT'D) What happened? Utter silence. Then a dripping sound. Needy looks down and sees large drops of blood spattering the linoleum. Jennifer continues to smile, staring directly at Needy. NEEDY (CONT'D) (TREMBLING) J-Jen? 
Jennifer lets out a horrifying banshee SCREAM, wailing at the top of her lungs. She vomits a torrent of evil- looking black bile all over herself and Needy and staggers wildly down the hallway. 
The bloody black bile hits the wall, splashing a framed school portrait of Needy. Needy screams and watches in horror as it slides down the wall. The bile has hundred of tiny SPINES sticking out of it, like little porcupine needles, and it appears to move by itself, oozing across the linoleum, creeping into the corners. It's truly revolting. Needy grabs Jennifer blindly and claps a hand over her mouth. Jennifer falls to her knees, her screams turning to jagged, insane laughter. Needy tries to run, but Jennifer grabs her and THROWS her against the wall with superhuman force, pinning her. Jennifer slowly, tantalizingly brushes her face against Needy's hair, her earlobe. Needy doesn't move a muscle. Jennifer's hand slides up Needy's ribcage. She presses her lips against Needy's carotid artery. We hear Needy's blood pumping, swishing. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JENNIFER (WHISPERING) Are you scared? Needy nods. Jennifer parts her lips. Then suddenly, she stops and PULLS AWAY, pushing Needy to the floor. Jennifer bolts out the front door and takes off running down the street. Needy is motionless for a moment, then stumbles toward the doorway. NEEDY (screaming after her) Jennifer! But she's long gone. 
INT. KETTLE HIGH - THE NEXT MORNING Moments before the first morning bell. Needy is sitting at her desk in English class, still visibly bruised from her scuffle with Jennifer the night before. She looks like she hasn't slept a wink. The mood is quiet and somber-- kids whisper about the fire and gather in groups. 
GOSSIPING GIRL (WHISPERING) I heard Needy and Jennifer were there and they had to fight their way out with a machete. 
OTHER GIRL Look, she's not even moving. GOSSIPING GIRL It's called Post Traumatic Stress Disorder... Suddenly, a figure steps in front of Needy. It's JENNIFER, looking absolutely gorgeous-- and remarkably unscathed. She smiles brightly at Needy as if nothing happened the night before. JENNIFER Happy Friday!, D-bag! NEEDY You-- you're all right! 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JENNIFER Yeah. Why wouldn't I be? NEEDY Last night. At my house. You were hurt. You had two black eyes and blood everywhere and... 
JENNIFER Needy, you're delusional. I got a little banged up when you made me go out that window, but I'm fine. NEEDY (DUMBFOUNDED) We had to go out that window. The bar was like, engulfed in flames! JENNIFER You do have a tendency to overreact. Remember at Girl Scout camp when you thought there was an earthquake and it was really just two guys with a ghetto blaster? 
NEEDY A lot of people died, Jennifer. They burned to death, or they choked, or they just got trampled. More than half of the people there didn't make it out. It's like, all over the news. National news. Kids are dead. Parents are dead. 
JENNIFER Anyone we know? 
NEEDY We know everyone! JENNIFER Sucks to be them, I guess. She giggles and reaches for her knockoff designer purse. NEEDY I don't get it. What's wrong with you? Jennifer applies lip gloss and smacks her lips together. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: NEEDY (CONT'D) And then she barfed up this disgusting prickly stuff that was like roadkill and sewing needles all mixed together. She shudders at the memory 
CHIP Yuck. Like those porcupine meatballs my mom makes with the rice sticking out? NEEDY Yeah, like almost that bad! CHIP and Needy ponder the grotesque image in silence. CHIP It was probably because she inhaled a whole bunch of smoke. 
NEEDY No. It was something evil. 
CHIP You might want    to talk to the school shrink,    Needy. I'm not saying that to    be a dillhole. I'm actually kinda    concerned. 
NEEDY Chip, I'm a National Merit Scholar. I don't tell whoppers and I'm not crazy. CHIP I didn't say you were crazy. It's just that everyone's a little messed up about this. It's okay to feel... NEEDY Discombobulated? CHIP Yeah, you know. Fucked up. As they prepare to leave, COLIN GRAY approaches Needy. He's a cute PUNK/GOTH guy wearing black nail polish, a lip ring, and full wardrobe by Hot Topic. COLIN Hi Needy. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
Chip blatantly scoots closer to Needy, eyeing Colin suspiciously. NEEDY Oh. Hi, Colin. COLIN (DRAMATIC) I heard you were there last night. In the fiery trenches. NEEDY Uh-huh. COLIN Well, I'm glad you made it out. Really. 
NEEDY Thanks. 
Colin walks away. Chip looks jealous. CHIP How are you friends with Colin Gray? I thought Colin Gray only talked to the Dead Girls. We see a group of GOTH GIRLS splayed against their lockers in full regalia. One wears an ACCORDION for no reason. NEEDY I just am. We have Composition together. He's a really good writer. You know-- he's so dark and emotional and all. CHIP Oh. I can relate. I'm also like that, even if I'm not all obvious about it like a poseur. NEEDY Walk me home? 
CHIP You know it. 
EXT. KETTLE HIGH FOOTBALL FIELD - CONTINUOUS JONAS KOZELLE, the JOCK we saw sobbing earlier, is standing at the deserted football field. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: It's a gray, overcast fall day and the wind whistles eerily through the trees. The football is set back a good a distance from the school, and Jonas is all alone. In the distance, a tiny figure slowly approaches, It starts a dot on the horizon. As it draws closer, we see it's JENNIFER. Her bright, lipsticked grin is eerie and unmistakable. Jonas glances briefly over his right shoulder, indifferent. A few seconds later, he glances again. Strangely, Jennifer ISN'T THERE. Jennifer suddenly appears on Jonas's left side, startling him. 
JENNIFER Hi! 
JONAS (ALARMED) Oh. Hey, Jennifer. JENNIFER I'm crazy-sorry about your profound loss. You are crying about Craig, right? 
JONAS He was my best friend. Jennifer puts her arm around him sympathetically. JENNIFER I know. I was close to him too. You know, I was there last night in that horrible place. I saw Craig a few minutes before the fire broke out. JONAS You-- you did? JENNIFER Yeah. I was probably the last person to talk to him. Like, ever. Literally. JONAS Wow. What did he say? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS Needy is preparing herself a fried bologna sandwich in the kitchen. Needy's ALBINO FERRET chases a ball across the cracked floor. Needy scrapes the sandwich out of the skillet and takes a bite. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NEEDY Fried bologna is the bomb! (to ferret) You want some, Greedo? She tuns on the kitchen radio and is surprised to hear a very familiar song: "Through the Trees," by Soft Shoulder. Suddenly, she pauses, a look of UNEASE and even FEAR crossing her face. She stops and braces herself against the counter, her KNEES SHAKING. Something isn't right. She drops the sandwich. Greedo goes straight for it. NEEDY (CONT'D) Something's wrong... As Needy sinks to her knees, she stares straight ahead at the REFRIGERATOR. A photo magnet of JENNIFER leers back at her. 
She closes her eyes. A brief, near-subliminal FLASH of the carnage in the woods... 
The song ends, snapping Needy out of her reverie. RADIO DJ That was Soft Shoulder, the local band who became the unlikely heroes of the tragedy in Devil's Kettle last night. Eyewitnesses say the boys helped numerous people escape the inferno, risking their own lives in the process. That's rock n' roll with a conscience, ladies and gentlemen. Had a lot of requests for that one... 
EXT. KETTLE HIGH CAMPUS - SAME 
Mr. Wroblewski ventures into the woods, heading toward the clearing. At first, we can only hear mysterious sounds-- scratching and smacking. Birds and animals are closely gathered in a circle. 
Suddenly, Mr. Wroblewski clutches his arm and gags, realizing the animals are feeding on a huge CARCASS. A BADGER looks up, its snout soaked in blood. Mr. Wroblewski begins to scream. The animals scatter. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
A glimpse of the CORPSE: It's Jonas, of course. His entire torso has been torn open, exposing his ribs and guts. Blood and viscera everywhere, INTESTINES strewn about the forest floor like party streamers. MR. WROBLEWSKI Virgin Mother! 
Mr. Wroblewski falls to his knees, hollering. 
INT. NEEDY'S HOUSE (KITCHEN) - CONTINUOUS 
Needy is seated at the kitchen table. She accidentally drops the remains of her sandwich on the floor, where the ferret quickly pillages it. NEEDY Crap! Needy's mom, ANTONIA "TONI" LESNICKI, has quietly entered the kitchen in her pajamas. She's pale and sweaty, as if she's been spooked. 
TONI You said it. NEEDY Oh, hi, Mom. I didn't know you were awake. 
TONI I just had one of my night terrors. 
NEEDY It's four o' clock, so technically you had a day terror. TONI Right, right. I'm all mixed up since I started working swing again. NEEDY What did you dream about? TONI I dreamed some bad people were trying to nail me to a tree with hammers and big stakes and shit. Just like Jesus. She crosses herself piously. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Needy's call-waiting beeps. NEEDY (CONT'D) That's my other line. JENNIFER So blow it off. 
She casually lights her HAIR on fire. The flames leap up, then die down, leaving her entirely untouched. NEEDY It'll just be a second. JENNIFER Pooh. I'm crossing you out. She draws a mini-X in the air. Needy clicks over. It's CHIP. We get a nice trifold pie- chart illustrating the intersecting calls. CHIP is panicked and sweaty in his living room. In the background, Chip's little sister CAMILLE bangs on a piano. Red police lights flash outside the picture window. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CHIP I need to see you right now. NEEDY I can barely hear you. CHIP Camille is playing piano. Knock it off, Camille! CAMILLE You knock it off! 
CHIP Can you meet me at McCullum in ten? 
CAMILLE You knock it off, Chip! You're penis cheese! 
NEEDY Fifteen. Back on JENNIFER: Jennifer is impatiently dragging a razor down her arm. Blood drips onto the rug. She smiles, in awe of herself. 
Needy clicks back over. NEEDY (CONT'D) I have to go. JENNIFER What could possibly be more important than me and my godlike powers? NEEDY I have to meet Chip at McCullum Park. JENNIFER Chip is looking cute to me lately. So tell me, is he packing some serious pubic inches? What's the story down there? NEEDY (QUICKLY) I gotta go. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
Needy hangs up the phone abruptly and grabs one of her many cardigan sweaters, heading for the door. 
EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - FOURTEEN MINUTES LATER The park is dark and tree-lined and appears to be a popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of Devil's Kettle. The abandoned sand volleyball pits are full of couples making out. Needy runs past them skittishly. As she ascends a grassy hill, CHIP is revealed, silhouetted against a backdrop of twirling police lights. Needy squints at the lights, sees CHIP's house in the distance. NEEDY Why are the cops at your house? CHIP They're not. They're at Jonas Kozelle's house. He got murdered. 
NEEDY What?! Like, he was shot by gangbangers? CHIP (EXASPERATED) No, Needy! Do you see anyone rollin' on dubs around here? (BEAT) Someone ripped Jonas limb from limb in the woods behind the school. Ate parts of him. They found teethmarks on him-- on the body. His voice cracks. We see a brief, terrifying FLASH of Jonas's mutilated body and pain-stricken face. Needy doesn't want to believe it. NEEDY Some animals must've got to him. CHIP Human teethmarks. 
NEEDY Who would do that? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CHIP I don't know. It just happened after school. No one's supposed to know yet, but my dad went over there and talked to the cops. Jonas's mom is catatonic. She's just staring out the front window like a zombie mannequin robot statue. NEEDY This can't be a coincidence. CHIP What do you mean, Needy? NEEDY A fiery death trap last night, and now a cannibal eats our starting tight-end? Come on! 
CHIP Don't get spooky on me, babe. 
NEEDY (CONT'D) Crass. It means scummy. Greedy. Am I the only one who actually does the vocab drills? 
CHASTITY, the girl in the Soft Shoulder T-shirt, turns to face Needy angrily. CHASTITY Soft Shoulder are American heroes. NEEDY No, they're not. I was there, Chastity. They didn't actually help anyone escape the fire. I don't even know how that rumor got started. CHASTITY Rumor?! RUMOR? It's true! It's on their Wikipedia page! NEEDY Oh, that's crap... 
MR. WROBLEWSKI GIRLS-- NEEDY They've milked our pain-- our loss- - to get a stupid record deal! No one would even know who they were if they hadn't been playing here that night. They used us. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
CHASTITY (growling, almost POSSESSED) You take that back, Needy Lesnicki! We need them now more then ever! 
MR. WROBLEWSKI That's enough. The BELL rings. Students get up and gather their books for the next period. 
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - SAME 
Needy and Jennifer slowly head toward their respective lockers. NEEDY I'm already sick of that song. JENNIFER Yeah. It's poorly produced. Could the bass be any lower in the mix? NEEDY No offense, but you look kind of drained. Is everything all right? 
JENNIFER I'm fine. It's just, like, wearing off or something. NEEDY What's wearing off? (ALARMED) Are you on pot? JENNIFER No, dick ridge! Just forget I said anything. COLIN GRAY, the punk/goth boy we met earlier, approaches Jennifer nervously as she exits the classroom. Needy drops behind them, eavesdropping. COLIN (to Needy) Hi. (to Jennifer, more NERVOUSLY) Hi, Jennifer. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JENNIFER Oh, hey Colin. Listen, can I copy your bio lab again? I never got around to dissecting that kitten fetus. COLIN Sure. Actually, I sort of wanted to ask you something. JENNIFER Oh. You want to know if I'll go out with you. COLIN No! Well-- yeah. (BEAT) How did you know? 
JENNIFER Just go ahead with the pitch. Colin fidgets awkwardly. 
COLIN Well, we've been having a lot of fun in class, you and I, and I just thought maybe we could go to a movie or something. There's a midnight showing of Rocky Horror at the Bijou next weekend... 
JENNIFER I don't like boxing movies. COLIN It's not...fuck it. Never mind. He turns to walk down the hallway, dejected. Jennifer watches him leave. JENNIFER Wait! Colin turns around. JENNIFER (CONT'D) Why don't you just come by my place tonight? I just got Aquamarine on DVD. It's about this girl who's like, half-sushi. I guess she has sex through her blowhole or something. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
COLIN Oh. Great! Okay. JENNIFER I'll text you my address. Colin walks away, grinning triumphantly. 
NEEDY That was random. JENNIFER I'm used to guys asking me out. NEEDY Colin's a really nice guy. JENNIFER He's into maggot-rock. He wears nail polish. 
JENNIFER You made it. COLIN What's going on? This isn't really your house, is it? JENNIFER No baby. This is our house, just for you and me. We can play Mommy and Daddy. Colin is totally dumbstruck. COLIN Do you even know my last name? JENNIFER Silly. I've been sending you signals all year. Couldn't you tell? You give me such a wettie. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She starts KISSING Colin on the neck. We can see confusion-- and fear-- in his eyes. 
INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - SAME Chip fumbles below his waist, obviously struggling with the condom. Needy leans forward for a closer look. NEEDY Oh. It's got little bumps on it. I can hardly wait. 
INT. 1004 CAMERFORD - SAME Jennifer grips Colin's face in her hands and forcibly kisses him on the mouth. Colin succumbs, but stiffly. We hear a SCRATCHING noise. Colin pulls away instinctively and sees MICE and ROACHES emerging from the walls, skittering over surfaces. COLIN Jennifer... 
Jennifer looks over her shoulder and giggles. JENNIFER You scared? I thought boys like you were into vermin. 
She unbuttons his jeans. They fall noisily to the floor-- they're the baggy Hot Topic kind with chains and buckles galore. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) Nice hardware, Ace. 
Colin into Jennifer's eyes. There's something horrible about her face...like she's become almost corpselike. COLIN (FAINTLY) No way... JENNIFER Oh, don't you dare pass out! I need you to be conscious. COLIN I gotta go... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JENNIFER I need you frightened. Colin tries to jerk away, but Jennifer easily disengages his arm from its socket. A sickeningly moist SNAP. Colin cries out in pain. 
JENNIFER (CONT'D) I need you hopeless. She slams him to the ground and mounts him. Her jaw unhinges, opening her mouth to a horrifying, inhuman degree. Her teeth are razor-sharp and grotesquely crowded, like they belong to some horribly deformed dog. She descends on him, feeding ravenously. 
We see their shadows against the wall: Jennifer lunging hungrily, blood spraying up from Colin's jugular. We can hear him screaming and gargling on his own blood. 
INT. CHIP'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
CHIP is doggedly pumping away on top of Needy, his eyes closed in concentration. Needy's vacant eyes are suddenly brimming with tears. NEEDY (SOFTLY) Hopeless..hopeless... CHIP opens his eyes. 
CHIP What? Am I hurting you? Needy starts weeping. CHIP (CONT'D) Am I too big? Tears roll down Needy's cheeks. She begins moaning, then SCREAMING at that top of her lungs. 
She hallucinates liquid seeping through the walls, blood and lymph oozing in at the corners and windows. Then the infamous spiny black bile... Pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness. Skulls, jesters, demons, death. It's the worst acid trip imaginable. Needy rubs her eyes frantically and continues to scream. (CONTINUED) 
MICK (to band members) Hey guys? Do we even know if she's a virgin? 
A GLINT OF HOPE in Jennifer's eyes. Maybe if she lies she can save herself. 
JENNIFER Yes...yes! Of course I'm a virgin! I've never done sex ever. I don't even know how. So maybe you should find some other girl who does. Know how. 
NIKOLAI Told you, Dirk. You owe me a beer. 
DIRK (PREOCCUPIED) Sure, man. 
EXT. FOREST CLEARING (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT 
The van rumbles down an uneven forest path, deep into the woods. They arrive at the real Devil's Kettle-- roaring, ominous waterfalls. There's a crude stone altar illuminated by moonlight. 
INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM (PRESENT DAY) - NIGHT Needy is still cowering on her bedroom floor, captivated by the tale in progress. Jennifer is reclining in the bed with a relaxed, supernatural glow. NEEDY What did they do to you? JENNIFER Just let me finish. So they drove all the way out to the falls. I tried to figure out an escape, but it was so dark out there... 
EXT. THE FALLS (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT 
The door of the van slides open. Nikolai pulls Jennifer out of the van and hustles her into the clearing. He looks up into the sky. 
NIKOLAI We got a waxing moon. Perfection. 
MICK You're the man, Wolf. 
The four band members surround Jennifer, looking statuesque in their sexy rock n' roll ensembles. 
Without warning, Nikolai hauls off and KICKS Jennifer. She yelps and falls onto her back on the dirt. 
Dirk looks apprehensive. 
DIRK I don't know if we should go through with this. 
NIKOLAI (ANGRILY) Do you want to be rich and famous like the guy from Maroon 5? Or do you want to be a huge suicidal loser? 
DIRK (SADLY) Maroon 5. 
NIKOLAI Then grow a pair and fetch me the ritual! God. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) We've spent months making offerings to the "man downstairs," and whaddya know? Satan delivered! We went from college radio to being courted by the majors in two months. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) NIKOLAI (CONT'D) But that's not enough, Jenny. We want designer drugs. We want groupies that have their own groupies. We want speedballs and stadium tours and Skittles sorted by color. In short, we want more. And to get more, we have to butcher you. And bleed you. 
JENNIFER (DESPERATE) Maybe you could just hire a publicist. Make some T-shirts or something. Hey, I could be on your street team! 
NIKOLAI Sorry, darling. 
JENNIFER Please... 
NIKOLAI (LOUDLY) Start chanting, boys. 
The group begins chanting jibberish in unison. Jennifer struggles, watching as their eyes go hollow and black. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) With deepest malice, we deliver this virgin unto thee. 
He unsheathes a huge, gleaming knife and raises it Psycho- style, admiring his reflection in the blade. 
DIRK Dude, that is a hot murder weapon! 
NIKOLAI It's a bowie knife. 
DIRK Bowie. Nice. 
Snickering, Nikolai begins to sing "Starman" by David Bowie. The group joins in merrily. 
NIKOLAI "There's a starman waiting in the sky..." 
BAND "He'd really like to meet us, but he thinks he'd blow our minds..." (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
As the group sings, Nikolai brings the knife down with a grin. We hear Jennifer SCREAMING, sounds of violence and clothes ripping as Nikolai relentlessly beats her and stabs her, his face contorting demonically. The band continues to sing, their voices carrying over the trees. 
Nikolai walks over to where the "devil side" of the falls rushes into a black hole. He drops the murder weapon into the churning water, smiling. 
INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM (PRESENT DAY) - CONTINUOUS Needy's expression is both incredulous and horrified. Jennifer is totally matter-of-fact. She picks at her nails with a wooden cuticle stick from Needy's night stand. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
CHIP You--you really think Jennifer killed Jonas and Colin? NEEDY And possibly Ahmet from India. 
Needy is silent for a moment. She realizes CHIP will never believe her and that she'll lose him forever if she continues babbling. CHIP Really? You think she ate those guys? NEEDY No. No! Of course not! 
CHIP Is that what you think? 
NEEDY No...Listen, I'll make an appointment with Mr. Feely. I'm real sorry about this sudden onset of teenage paranoia. (ROBOTIC) My hormones and emotions are aswirl, and my moods are erratic... CHIP isn't totally convinced, but his face softens. CHIP It's all right, Needy. 
NEEDY This has been a crummy school year, Chip. CHIP No shit. Needy turns and pitches the black binder into a Dumpster. 
NEEDY Listen, I'm done with all that devil stuff. Do you know what you're wearing to Turnabout? CHIP I was thinking a suit with black shoes and a boutonniere, right here. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
He taps his chest. Needy laughs. NEEDY V.O. I was so in love with him. I didn't want to mess it up with my infectious crazy. Only I wasn't actually crazy. Everyone else was crazy. But when you're the only sane one, you might as well be crazy. It's subjective, you know? 
CHIP What color dress are you gonna wear? I need to order your wrist corsage. NEEDY I don't know yet. CHIP How about magenta? You're definitely a winter. My mom says winters should wear regal jewel tones like magenta. Or possibly teal. NEEDY Oh yeah, your mom's an Avon lady. 
CHIP Well, they call them "sales reps" now. NEEDY Right. Well, I'll try to find something magenta. CHIP That'll look dope. 
INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM (TO ESTABLISH) - EVENING A group of student council kids are putting the finishing touches on the dance decorations. The theme is "Through the Trees" and there are papier mache trees everywhere. 
INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM - EVENING Needy stands in front of a full-length mirror, wearing a big `80s-style magenta prom dress. It sags on her flat chest and looks ridiculous. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Greedo the ferret circles her ankles. Toni, Needy's mom, appears behind her with a curling iron. TONI You look beautiful. 
NEEDY I look pork stupid. TONI No, you've got that tiny waist, like a fashion model. I always thought you looked like Cindy Crawford. She gently takes off Needy's glasses. 
NEEDY Who's Cindy Crawford? TONI One of the great beauties of our time. She's even got a mole like you, except hers is on her face. She takes a section of Needy's hair and wraps it around the curling iron. Smoke rises. 
NEEDY Ow! You're too close to my neck. TONI Well, if Chip gives you a hickey, you can just tell everyone I burned you. NEEDY Gross, Mom. Chip isn't that ostentatious. 
She rapidly shoves another one under her dress and pops it again, smirking. GOTH GIRL #2 (CONT'D) Your other abortion. GOTH GIRL I hate your guts, Madison. The girls glare at each other. 
Needy walks in, looking small and apprehensive in her bad `80s dress. She looks around for Chip, but he's not there yet. A few mean kids point at her dress and snicker. Needy ladles some juice into a paper cup and leans against the wall, waiting anxiously for her Prince Charming. 
EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS Chip is cutting through the park on his way to the dance. He whistles to himself. Across the park, he sees a STRAY DOG trotting toward him. The dog pants aggressively. CHIP tries to smile, but looks uncomfortable. A few SQUIRRELS emerge from the trees, gazing curiously at him. 
INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Couples are beginning to grind against each other on the dance floor. Needy watches them longingly. She checks her Mickey Mouse watch. 
EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS Chip picks up the pace, jogging down the path. In the distance behind him we can barely make out Jennifer's form. She looks more spectral then we've ever seen her. 
Chip speeds up instinctively. Suddenly, Jennifer's about ten paces closer. Then she's closer again, as if she can fold space and time. She's ethereal, flickering. CHIP turns to look over his shoulder. 
INT. DEVIL'S KETTLE HIGH GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS The music fades out and there's a squeal of feedback from the sound system. Mr. Wroblewski walks onto the stage in a bad suit. He awkwardly picks up the mic with his one good hand and pats it with his robotic one. MR. WROBLEWSKI Can I have everyone's attention please? The students turn to look at him, annoyed by the distraction. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D) Welcome to the Turnabout Dance. I hope you've all had an opportunity to consume the Pecan Sandies and Cran-Grape that were so generously donated by the Parents Club. 
Murmuring and applause. MR. WROBLEWSKI (CONT'D) But the real treat is yet to come. It's happening right about now, this treat of which I speak. We have some very special guests tonight. They were kind enough to take a break from their sold-out national tour and play our dance for free. 
Needy gags on her juice. 
EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS 
Chip continues to hurry briskly along through the park. JENNIFER CHIP! CHIP makes an incoherent noise and jumps as Jennifer appears, improbably, right in front of him. She's wearing a gorgeous white formal gown and looks perfect. JENNIFER (CONT'D) Didn't you hear me calling your name? CHIP You weren't calling my name. JENNIFER Yes, I was. CHIP I couldn't hear it. 
JENNIFER I think you were maybe spacing out. You were like this: Derrrrr. She mimics a blank, drooling expression. CHIP I was? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JENNIFER Yes, exactly like that. Listen, I need to talk to you about you-know- who. Our little Needy. CHIP I know. 
JENNIFER Are you worried? `Cause I'm super- stressed about her. God knows how I even sleep at night. CHIP She hasn't been the same for weeks. JENNIFER I think I know what's wrong with her. In fact, I know I know what's wrong with her. 
CHIP Then tell me. JENNIFER I feel bad telling you this. (SIGHING) Okay, you know Needy's been a total Lithium candidate since the night Colin Gray died. But that's not just because he was brutally murdered and stuff. It's because....I don't wanna say this. 
She rushes toward the gym exit, tripping in her high heels. 
EXT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS CHIP is hypnotized in the glow of the streetlights. Jennifer leans forward and kisses him on the neck JENNIFER Needy didn't deserve a boy like you. 
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS Needy is running toward the park in her gown. She takes off her shoes and tosses them aside, her arms and legs pumping furiously. 
NEEDY V.O. One thing people don't know about me is that I'm fast. I just never went out for track because I look bad in shorts. Also, Jennifer told me track was for lezzies. But I am. Fast, I mean. Even in that fucking afterbirth of a dress, I could really tear up the asphalt. 
She picks up the pace, cheeks puffing. NEEDY V.O. (CONT'D) I had to. I was running for his life. 
INT. MC CULLUM PARK - CONTINUOUS Jennifer is kissing Chip. She pulls him down onto the damp, muddy grass. JENNIFER Ooh, you're so salty! CHIP Yeah, you too. JENNIFER Say it like you mean it. CHIP You're so salty. I need water. It burns. The salty burns my mouth. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JENNIFER Say I'm better than Needy. CHIP What? Why? JENNIFER We really shouldn't be doing this. She pulls away from him, feigning a guilty conscience. CHIP (QUICKLY) You're better than Needy. Jennifer smiles, satisfied. JENNIFER Natch. She resumes kissing him enthusiastically. CHIP This feels weird. Can we go somewhere else? JENNIFER I have just the place. 
She stands up and starts to lead Chip toward an abandoned, fenced-off COMMUNITY POOL. It's drained and spooky and looks dangerous. CHIP Murphy Pool? I don't think we can go in there. I knew some skater guys who went in there. They got in big trouble and now they have to pick up garbage for 100 hours. Jennifer giggles and pulls him along. 
JENNIFER You're in big trouble anyway. Come on. 
She begins to climb the chain link fence. 
EXT. CHIP'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS Needy jogs toward CHIP's house. Exhausted and sweaty, she presses the doorbell. She falls to her knees on the front stoop, panting and wheezing. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Camille answers the door. NEEDY (STRAINED) Well, hi there Camille! Is Chipper home? 
Camille has no reply. She eyes Needy suspiciously and licks a Popsicle. CHIP's mother appears and shoves Camille aside. CHIP'S MOM Needy? Is something wrong? NEEDY Where's Chip? 
CHIP'S MOM (CONFUSED) He left for the dance at least twenty minutes ago. He certainly should have been there by now. 
NEEDY He walked? Mrs. Dove, you mean to only tell me that in these dangerous, godless times-- you let your only son walk alone at night? 
CHIP'S MOM Well, it's only five blocks. My God, your hair is... NEEDY Which way did he go? CHIP'S MOM He usually cuts across the park. She turns to scold Camille. CHIP'S MOM (CONT'D) Camille, let's sit like a lady! No one wants to see your kiki. She turns back to address Needy. 
CHIP'S MOM (CONT'D) Why don't you try... But Needy's gone. 
NEEDY (CONT'D) Saint Jude, patron saint of hopeless causes: Please give me the power to crush this bitch. Jennifer looks up with demonic, bloodshot eyes just as Needy leaps off the diving board. Needy lands on Jennifer's shoulders, taking her out. She wraps her legs around Jennifer's neck and drags her under the water. Jennifer emerges. Needy grabs her by the hair and girly- slaps her furiously across the face. Then she spots the PEPPER SPRAY lying by the side of the pool. She grabs it and sprays it in Jennifer's eyes. Jennifer shrieks and vomits NASTY, SPINY GORE all over Needy and Chip. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JENNIFER Fuck this J.V. shit! Jennifer ROCKETS straight up into the air like a goddess, hovering ten feet above the pool. Her eyes burn. Her skin is corpselike. She's drenched from head to toe in the prickly ooze. 
CHIP (CROAKING) She can fly? NEEDY She's just hovering, CHIP. It's not that impressive. Jennifer speaks in a metallic, demonic-sounding voice. 
JENNIFER God, do you have to undermine everything I do? You're such a player-hater. 
Needy glares at Jennifer, surprisingly fearless. NEEDY You're a jerk. JENNIFER Nice insult, Lizzie McGuire. Got any more harsh digs? 
NEEDY You know what? You were never a good friend. Ever. Even when we were little. You used to steal my toys and pour lemonade on my bed and make me be Ugly Ashley when we played Barbies! JENNIFER And now I'm eating your boyfriend! See? At least I'm consistent. NEEDY Why do you need him? Huh? She begins to weep. 
NEEDY (CONT'D) (SOBBING) Why do you need the one guy who's ever liked me? You can have anyone, Jennifer! (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) NEEDY (CONT'D) The cutest guy in school. The mailman. A teacher. You could probably even have a huge star like Chad Michael Murray. So why Chip? Why him? Is it just to piss me off? Or is it because you're insecure? 
Jennifer floats in midair toward the pool deck and drifts down, landing on her feet. Needy crawls out of the pool and faces her down. JENNIFER I am not insecure. God, what a joke! How could I be insecure? I was the Snowflake Queen! NEEDY Yeah, two years ago. When you were socially relevant. JENNIFER I AM STILL SOCIALLY RELEVANT! 
NEEDY You were skinny then, too! A look of ABJECT HORROR on Jennifer's face. She reels back against the chain link fence, her eyes blazing. JENNIFER I'm gonna eat your soul and shit it out, Lesnicki. Her voice is now an unearthly growl. In the background, Chip is slowly, painfully pulling a POOL SKIMMER with an eight-foot handle off the pool deck. 
NEEDY (TREMBLING) I thought you only murdered boys. JENNIFER I go both ways. She HURTLES herself toward Needy, roaring, her eyes white- hot, her jaws agape. She's monstrous. Chip suddenly stumbles in front of Needy and holds the HANDLE of the POOL SKIMMER in front of them like a spear. As Jennifer flies forward at demonic speed, she IMPALES HER ENTIRE TORSO on the handle. Needy screams. There's a beat of deafening silence. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
Chip collapses on the pool deck. Jennifer rises uncertainly to her feet, "shishkebabbed" on the giant skimmer. With effort, she pulls the handle out of her body in several stages. JENNIFER (CONT'D) Ow-Ow-Ow. Needy watches, and realizes Jennifer is injured. Blood drips onto the pool deck. NEEDY (SURPRISED) We hurt you... 
Blood trickles out of Jennifer's wound. She tries to plug the hole with her hand. 
JENNIFER Got a tampon? Needy shakes her head mutely. JENNIFER (CONT'D) Thought I'd ask. You seemed like you might be pluggin'. 
She begins to climb the fence, wincing in pain, then glances over her shoulder at Needy and Chip. NEEDY Where are you going? JENNIFER Fuck this noise. I'm out. You losers are more trouble then you're worth. She continues climbing. NEEDY (EMOTIONAL) Why give up now? He's almost dead! Get your bulimic ass back here and kill us both! JENNIFER Nah. I mean, you say I've been a bad friend all these years. I might as well throw you a bone. 
Needy stops to stare at them, her gaze calm but obviously insane. They break apart and stare back at her. GIRL What are you looking at, Clumpy? NEEDY (QUIETLY) Just watching your old man try to suck the ugly off your face. GUY What did you say? 
Needy bends over, casually holds one nostril closed, and does a "farmer blow." A bloody clot flies out of her nose. The guy takes a good look at Needy and blinks, startled. GUY (CONT'D) Are you supposed to be Goth or something? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
NEEDY Did you know the original Goths were a Germanic tribe that settled in Rome? They didn't wear black. They wore regular linen tunics. I don't know why nobody else knows that. 
The couple have already resumed making out. Needy rolls her eyes, turns away, and continues limping into the gym. 
INT. GYM - CONTINUOUS 
Needy enters the gym and slams the door shut behind her. People ignore her as she slowly walks toward the stage. They're too busy slow dancing and laughing in their respective cliques. She looks up at the stage, where Soft Shoulder are playing an insufferably long coda. 
Nikolai noodles through a guitar solo, then looks up and sees Needy looking directly at him, her eyes full of hate. Nikolai gulps nervously and elbows Dirk. 
Needy points to her eyes with two fingers, then points at Nikolai, as if to say, Gotcha. She looks completely possessed. 
NIKOLAI (to Dirk) We gotta get out of here. DIRK Why? NIKOLAI I think this girl's flipping out. 
DIRK What could she do to us? 
NIKOLAI Look at her. Dirk takes one look at Needy's face and takes off his guitar. Nikolai motions for the rest of the band to leave the stage. The music stops abruptly. The kids in the gym murmur and complain, confused. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Needy tries to follow them. She limps blindly toward the stage and climbs up. Everyone watches, gasping in horror. By now the band is disappearing out the side door of the gym. NEEDY (into the mic) You didn't play your hit yet. But they're gone. Needy looks out at her classmates. They stare back. She PASSES OUT COLD. 
INT. CHIP'S STREET - MORNING (TO ESTABLISH) NEEDY V.O. They found Chip the following morning. The police couldn't find an explanation for the "substance" in the pool, so they chose not to mention it to the press. In fact, they treated the whole incident like a bad dream. 
INT. CHIP'S HOUSE (LIVING ROOM) - MORNING We see the POLICE (including newly minted officer ROMAN DUDA) informing Chip's mother that his body has been found. She collapses onto the floor, curling up into the fetal position. NEEDY Trouble was, some of us would never wake up. 
INT. NEEDY'S BEDROOM - DAY Needy is lying in bed, shaking, her arm in a cast. Her mother tries to rouse her. NEEDY V.O. I never went back to school after that. Didn't talk much either. My mom bought some books so she could teach me at home like crazy Christians with 14 kids do. But I wasn't a very cooperative student. 
Needy pulls the covers over her head. 
(CONTINUED)

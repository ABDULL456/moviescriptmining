FLASH GORDON 
Written by 
Lorenzo Semple Jr. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. WIDE AFRICAN LANDSCAPE - MORNING 
At first only darkness, then the rising sun paints in an endless savanna from horizon to horizon. We hear savage drums beating in the distance coming from some unknown place. 
The sun clears the horizon. Suddenly it changes amazingly: the white disc goes through a rapid series of color transitions, from yellow to green to purple to an incredible BLOOD RED. From it shoots a RED LIGHTNING BOLT. 
The sky echoes with THUNDER. 
We hear a HOWLING ethereal wind, but not a twig of the brush stirs as bolt after bolt of RED LIGHTNING rips the sky, with each one a TITLE or CREDIT appearing. 
Under FINAL CREDIT snow is beginning to fall on the burning blood-red savanna. 
EXT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY 
I's a Twin Otter with the logo of some commuter airline. It buzzes along over pleasant countryside, through a sky that's almost unnaturally serene and filled with fleecy white clouds. 
INT. PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY 
There are just two passengers in the cabin. One is DALE ARDEN, a great looking dark-haired girl sitting by herself and reading a book entitled "KARATE FOR THE SINGLE GIRL.... A Guide to Survival In The City." A few rows forward, near the open door into the pilots' compartment, is FLASH GORDON. He's studying a football play-sheet, one of those diagrammed things with X's and 0's for the players and dotted-line arrows indicating the directions of movement. 
Suddenly the plane makes a violent bump. It almost knocks the book from DALE'S hand. She looks out the window with sudden fright, tossing hair out of her eyes, in a gesture that's habitual to her in moments of stress. 
There's nothing to see outside but the pretty clouds. She looks forward again and watches FLASH standing up easily, leaning in t..e cockpit doorway to speak to the PILOTS. 
INT. PLANE/ COCKPIT - CONTINUOUS (CO-P:ILOT, DALE, FLASH, PILOT) 
FLASH What was that, fellas? 
PILOT Clear-air turbulence, is all. Nothing SERIOUS 
CO-PILOT But nothing you'd want to toss a third-down pass through either -- (Grinning back at FLASH) Can I have an autograph for my kid, Mr. Gordon? 
FLASH Sure -- my pleasure. 
As FLASH takes a bit of paper from the CO-PILOT, the plane takes another jolt, even more violent than the first. 
PILOT Wow. Call Westchester Approach, see what they've got. 
FLASH I sure hope we don't have to turn back. I mean this is first day of training camp, I wouldn't want to be LATE -- 
PILOT Seat-belt time. 
FLASH starts back to his seat. The plane jumps again, shudders violently. He holds on, calls up front: 
FLASH Maybe it'd be smoother if you went HIGHER -- 
DALE Will you SHUT UP? (as FLASH's head SWIVELS) Look, Mister Flash Gordon, they have their hands full -- just let 'em drive. 
INT. PLANE - CONTINUOUS (DALE, FLASH) 
The plane buffets. FLASH is sent reeling, catches hold of the rack above DALE, lowers himself into the seat next to her. He buckles fast, takes out a candy bar and offers it to her. 
FLASH When you're nervous, it can help to chew on something 
DALE Thanks a lot -- I look dumb enough to take candy from a stranger? 
FLASH I'm not a stranger exactly -- You know my name. 
Now it's FLASH'S turn to break off. ZARKOV is pointing a gun at him. 
ZARKOV Up the stairs to the tower! Ahead of me -- quick! -- (as they gape at him, FROZEN) Quick I said: We haven't much time -- Earth is being attacked! -- there's only one slim chance of saving it! 
FLASH Mister, you are insane! 
HOWL of ether-wind increases. Storm of RED LASER BOLTS. Glass showers them as parts of the green house EXPLODE and dry foliage bursts into FLAME. 
ZARKOV Up the stairs -- RUN! 
ZARKOV jabs the revolver into DALE'S back. RED BOLTS zap around. FLASH whispers to her as they start running up ahead of ZARKOV. 
FLASH Go with the flow -- wait for a chance! 
Below them, bottom of staircase disintergrates in a RED FLASH. 
INT. TOP LEVEL OF GREENHOUSE TOWER (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV) 
ZARKOV rips away a screen of foliage, revealing a MIRROR BRIGHT capsule, seamless but for one door. He yanks that open. 
On every side things are blowing up and burning under the merciless rain of bolts. One strikes the capsule head on, but does not even leave a mark. 
ZARKOV I need your help to take off! Get in or I shot you dead! 
DALE gasps and shrinks back. 
FLASH Take off for where? 
ZARKOV God only knows -- whatever black corner of space this is coming from -- wherever HE is!. -- we'll plunge into the devil's heart and destroy him! We'll die ourselves, of course, but our names will be honored till the end of time! 
DALE Look, Doc -- I don't book kamikaze tours -- never. 
FLASH is poised to jump, but ZARKOV suddenly pushes DALE off- balance, INTO the capsule. FLASH leaps after her. 
INT. CAPSULE (DALE, ZARKOV) 
It is curiously transparent from the inside, mirrored only on the exterior. There are some controls and displays, but in general the interior is severely ascetic: as far removed from conventional spacecraft as ZARKOV's solitary genius is from everyday science. 
Immediately starting to set switches in a frenzy of activity, ZARKOV waves the gun at FLASH. 
ZARKOV Sit down there! Foot on the red pedal! 
DALE Flash! Sack him! 
ZARKOV wheels and pulls the door shut. FLASH jumps him. He punches ZARKOV in the gut. ZARKOV slams him back with the well-known strength of a madman. FLASH clobbers him again. Falling, ZARKOV dives sidewards and hits a switch. 
The capsule WHINES SOFTLY and begins to WHIRL. Looking out through the transparent wall, it is as if the capsule itself was motionless and the scene outside is whirling. What's left of the greenhouse is under a constant rain of those LASER BOLTS, flashing fire that makes us dizzy. 
FLASH staggers to his feet and finds DALE, folds his arms around her protectively. The centrifugal force is rapidly increasing now, throws them both against the wall. Faster and faster, whirling, the force presses DALE'S body back against FLASH'S until they are almost one flesh. 
We move over and find ZARKOV plastered against another part of the whirling capsule, his face drained white and distorted by the terrific G-Force operating here now, his lips moving as he speaks with enormous effort: 
ZARKOV, Friendship...Built this to send to them in...Friendship...The end now...End of the world....Unless we (every sound an effort NOW) Unless...We...Three...Can... 
ZARKOV'S eyes close. He loses consciousness. 
EXT. GREENHOUSE - LONG SHOT (MINIATURE) 
Totally ablaze within now, one huge fantastic jewel of fire. The whole central tower explodes outward. From the inferno a MIRROR-BRIGhT capsule slowly rises, hovers, begins picking up speed again as it ascends. 
EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT 
Whirling, whirling, invincibly unharmed by the LASER BOLTS which glance off it again and again, accelerating up into space. 
EXT. CAPSULE IN FLIGHT - POV 
FLASH Made it where, Doctor? 
ZARKOV I don't know. 
Suddenly DALE gasps, reacting to something she SEES through the transparent-from-within wall. They all look around and SEE those STRANGE MEN approaching. 
DALE Don't. Suddenly I like it in here just fine -- 
EXT. GRASSY AREA - DAY (ARMORED MEN, FLASH, LEADER, ZARKOV) 
The door of the CAPSULE is opened from the inside. ZARKOV and DALE and FLASH get out. THE MEN stop. Long beat as the two parties gaze at each other, the first human eye ever to see an extraterrestrial being. FLASH walks up to the leader. 
FLASH Hello -- my name's Flash Gordon -- can you understand me? (SILENCE) We're from EARTH -- we come as friends. 
ZARKOV (URGENT) Extend your hand! That's the gesture of friendship known everywhere! 
With a warm grin, FLASH extends hi right hand. 
FLASH Hi! 
CLACK! With lightning speed a manacle is slammed on FLASH'S wrist and he is thrown to Â·the ground as other RED MEN advance to handcuff DALE and ZARKOV. 
LEADER You are prisoners. I will take you now to Ming the Merciless, Ruler of the universe! 
ARMORED MEN (CHORUS) Hail, Ming! 
Groggily, FLASH lifts his head towards ZARKOV. 
FLASH Thanks, Doctor -- next time I'll call my own play. 
EXT. GRASSY AREA - POV THROUGH OPENING (DALE, FLASH) 
Another strange glimpse through an opening. Some fierce tethered BEAST is being goaded and tormented by MONGO MEN, as in an Elizabethan bear-baiting. On the floor lies the tor n body of one MAN who apparently got too close. 
DALE has one brief horrified GLIMPSE of this, then turns her head away and shuts her eyes as she's marched along. 
DALE Just do what I'm doing. Flash -- 
FLASH What are you doing? 
DALE Shutting my eyes -- dreaming I booked us to Disneyland. 
INT. MAIN PALACE HALL (ARMORED MEN) 
A gigantic STATUE comes into view amidst topless columns at the end. Light plays over it in ever-shifting patterns. As we come nearer, we SEE that this STATUE is cut out in the middle to form a throne. 
MING THE MERCILESS sits in the throne niche, silent, gazing down on the PRISONERS as they are marched to a halt before him. 
ARMORED MEN Hail, Ming! Hail, Great One Without Mercy! 
A hundred reduplicated ECHOES of that shout ring through unseen reaches of the palace. MING bends his head slightly in acknowledgement, points idly at the ARMORED MEN at the left of the group. 
INT. PALACE OF HALLS - SERIES OF DISSOLVES (ARMORED MAN, AURA, DALE, FLASH, KLYTUS, LEADER, MING, VOICES, ZARKOV) 
As FLASH, DALE and ZARKOV are marched along by many ARMORED MEN, perspectives are bewildering, curvilinear, surfaces 
bending away into caverns of gloom without measurable dimension. 
We pass an archway opening into what seems to be an AMUSEME- NT ARCADE. Glimpse of MONGO PEOPLE playing amazing electronic games, while MONGO GO-GO GIRLS cavort on a platform to unearthly music. 
ZARKOV Fantastic -- into a Black Hole and out the other side -- to this. Who said Hans Zarkov was mad? 
DALE You're mad. 
Look down over a balcony from a MOVING POV. A fencing glass is in session. SIX PAIRS OF MEN go at each other with magic swords which give off pyrotechnical displays each time the blades clash. Thrust, parry, SLASH! The head of one duellist EXPLODES in a bloodless fountain of fire. 
KLYTUS This woman will amuse you. 
ZARKOV (INTERESTED) Klytus can see the future, eh? 
MING He can foresee it -- but for a few moments only. It gives him a unique gift for survival, -- and treachery. 
ZARKOV Extraordinary. I'd like to study his beta factors -- I wager I could extend them with a course of telekinetic exercise. (peering at KLYTUS) Tell me -- when you use this fit does your temporal lobe prickle? Here? 
MING flashes a glance of interest at ZARKOV, then addresses the LEADER of the ARMORED MEN. 
MING Chain this one up. Preserve him for further examination. 
LEADER Hail, Ming! 
ZARKOV is roughly seized. FLASH starts after them angrily as they drag the scientist away. 
FLASH Oh no you don't! We came together and we're STAYING together! 
Languidly, MING indicates FLASH GORDON with a pointed finger. 
MING That one is useless to us. Remove him and kill him. 
Shock reactions. FLASH wheels back at MING as DALE steps in front of her friend. 
DALE You dirty old bastard can kill me too! 
CLOSE ANGLE - AURA 
Wetting her lips, moving sinuously to WHISPER to MING: 
AURA Don't kill him yet, Father. Give him to me! 
MING (EYEBROWS UP) What would your Prince Barin say? 
AURA I can handle Barin. 
MING Really, Aura -- your appetites are too monstrous -- even for our family. This could cause great trouble with Barin -- I must forbid it. 
AURA touches the rime of MING'S ear with her tongue as she WHISPERS AGAIN: 
AURA But you adore me, Father -- you ca refuse me nothing . Yes? 
WIDER SHOT 
As MING steps quickly away from his super-provocative daughter and indicates DALE. 
MING Take the Earth-woman to our quarters! Bathe and annoint her for our pleasure! 
A HOODED GUARD comes from shadow, moves towards DALE. 
FLASH starts around to defend her, but before he can do it DALE has made her own move. WHAM! Quick as lightning, she flattened the HOODED GUARD with a perfectly executed city- girl's kick to the balls. DALE is astonished at her own prowess. 
DALE My God -- and I thought that book was another rip-off- 
FLASH Watch out! Behind you! 
Three more HOODED GUARDS are emerging from the shadows towards DALE. 
QUICK ANGLES 
FLASH flies at them. An elbow in the mouth disposes of one. He seizes the man's mace-like club as he falls, uses it quickly to knock cold the other two. 
AURA'S eyes shine at FLASH'S prowess. Fascinated, she runs her moist tongue along the cutting edge of her teeth. 
Panting, braced, FLASH stands in front of DALE with raised mace. 
NO reply. MING turns his head and finds that KLYTUS is gone. Vanished. Not particularly surprised or concerned, MING gazes again toward the top of the stairs and answers his own question with a licentious smile. 
INT. A DARK METALLIC SHAFT - SHOOTING DOWN IT (AURA, FLASH) 
It is seemingly endless, faintly lt by phosphoresence from below. We dimly make out the figures of FLASH and AURA falling away from us, far below, falling, falling. We HEAR Hollow echoing VOICES reverbrating up to us. 
AURA Take a deep breath! Grab my ankle after we hit the water -- I'll lead you! 
FLASH Hit what water? 
In answer, we instantly HEAR a titanic SPLASH. 
INT. UNDERWATER (TANK) 
FLASH plummets down, AURA right after him. Recovering balance in a universe of bubbles, FLASH finds himself confronting an enormous savage LUMINOUS FISH. Wheeling himself away in fear and revulsion, FLASH encounters AURA. He seizes her ankle as directed. Holding his beat, FLASH swims after her through a maze of stalagmites growing up from the cavern floor. AURA dives down, leads him OUT OF SIGHT through a low opening. 
INT. UNDERGROUND GROTTO (AURA, FLASH, PLASH) 
FLASH and AURA emerge from a pool of water. FLASH staggers across and collapses on a fringe of beach. For sure, AURA'S wet clinging robe doesn't make her look any less sexy. He stares at her. 
AURA Catch your breath -- then I'll take you up and find you a disguise. 
FLASH You're saving my life. How can I Thank you? 
AURA I'll fly you to the forest of Arboria - we'll find a way. 
FLASH Let's get one thing straight -- I've got to find Dale and that nut Zarkov too -- rescue them and try to save Earth too. 
AURA Do you realize how foolish you are to tell that to me -- Ming's daughter? 
FLASH I'm no good at lying. 
AURA You're funny -- are all Eathlings like you, Flash Gordon? 
PLASH I guess I'm about average. 
INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR (AURA, FLASH) 
There are windows on one side, emitting a fierce GLARE. FLASH follows AURA rapidly along. Suddenly he stops short, looking in through the tinted glass. 
WHAT HE SEES - PLASMA CAVERN 
An infernal place, chief feature of which is a LAKE OF SEETHING MAGMA that slowly rotates within a wide encircling platform. The platform is piled with GLOWING RADIOACTIVE GRAVEL, being shoveled into the magma by LIZARDMAN SLAVES who toil in rythmic unison. 
FLASH (O.S.) What's that? 
AURA (O.S.) The plasma core. It's e source of the energy-beam my father ia aiming at Earth. You can't stop it. Ming is merciless and all-powerful! 
ANGLES - LIZARDMAN SLAVES 
Showing ankle electrodes shackled to each SLAVE, so that those who collapse can be shocked back to their feet by GUARDS stationed on a surrounding catwalk above. Any SLAVE unable to rise is summarily pitched into the magma by HOODED MEN, waiting like executioners to perform this chore. 
AURA (O.S.) (CONT'D) The slaves are Lizard Men. Once they had their own water Kingdom, the fairest of Mongo. Then they dared to rebel. They will suffer for it here forever. 
FLASH looks at AURA again, then back in the window. He reacts. 
INT. GROTTO - HIS POV IN CAVERN - ON A CATWALK (AURA) 
ZARKOV is being led along by SOLDIERS, heavily shackled. He stops, gazing in wonder at the seething lake, which FLARES UP BLINDINGLY with each shovel full of gravel. 
FLASH and AURA 
AURA You can't reach him. If a soldier spots you, it's instant death! -- Come! 
AURA takes his hand. With one backward look toward ZARKOV who of course has not seen him, FLASH follows her. 
ZARKOV stands before MING in chains, mesmerized by fantastic devices on every side. Most prominent is a huge transparent cube, supported in the air above a control console. MING moves to that, plays in it like an organist. we HEAR a soft intense hum, GLIMPSE great dish-like radio antennae turning on the top side of the dome. 
An astonishing things happens. Inside the cube a recognisable greenish globe appears like a three-dimensional holograph, slowly turning as the continents and oceans come into view below a veil of clouds. 
ZARKOV Earth! 
MING Yes, Zarkov -- as it was. Now as it will be, when my plasma reaches full force..... 
A sudden TIDE OF FIRE sweeps the globe, Even the clouds BURN. ZARKOV gasps as MING'S fingers dance of the control keys again. 
MING (CONT'D) And as it will be in yet another time, long after you have died. Earth reborn! A pleasant image, no? 
The fires recede. The hanging globe sparkles again with beauty just as it was except that the outlines of our continents have been subtly changed. 
ZARKOV But that's impossible! Even your perverted genius can't create new life! 
MING Of course I can create life. There's nothing easier. It only requires myself and one woman. 
ZARKOV (SUDDEN UNDERSTANDING) Dale Arden..... 
MING Who else? As in that childish myth of yours -- Adam and Eve, wasn't it? I will breed with her and repopulate the Earth in my own image. I've already done it on over a thousand planets. 
MING touches a key. The image of Earth DISAPPEARS from the cube. ZARKOV glares hatred at MING for a beat, then his eye catches something else. 
WHAT HE SEES 
A big block of crystal on the floor with two swords embedded in it, just their hilts sticking out. 
ANGLE to include ZARKOV. Chained as he is, he suddenly bounds over and seizes a sword hilt, tries to pull it out. It doesn't budge. 
MING (CONT'D) The magic blades are not for your kind, Zarkov. One is my own the other will only be withdrawn by my rightful heir. Pull on them with all your MIGHT: 
ZARKOV tugs desperately, but it doesn't give an inch. He falls panting over the block. 
ZARKOV Monster! 
MING laughs, makes a sign to a SOLDIER. 
MING Return him to the dungeon. 
INT. MING'S SERAGLIO (DALE, HEDONIA) 
DALE stands amongst the EXOTIC FEMALES of this lavish place, being gently but firmly divested of her clothes and put into a diaphanous gown. They intend her no harm. Though each has some slight unearthly peculiarity, all are very beautiful. 
Tickled, DALE can't suppress a giggle. The females are amazed and delighted by this phenomenon. They take turns poking at her ribs as tall HEDONIA glides up, bearing a flagon of green liquid. 
HEDONIA Drink this. 
DALE recoils, her giggling cut short. 
DALE What is it -- some rotten drug? 
HEDONIA It has no name. But many brave men died to bring it across space from Cythera, planet of Pleasure. It will make your hours with Ming more agreeable. 
With a karate chop, DALE- knocks the flagon away. HEDONIA rubs her hurt wrist but does not seem angry. 
HEDONIA (CONT'D) We are of different race, Dale Arden but we all are women here. I know your fears. Believe me, it will be better if you drink it... 
HEDONIA retrieves the flagon from the silken pillow where it landed, extends it again to DALE. A shout! 
DALE Flash! Where are you?? 
Of course there is no answer. Sudden tears of despair spring from DALE'S eyes. She seizes the flagon and impulsively drinks it. Her expression changes. 
DALE (CONT'D) Say, this stuff isn't bad at all. 
DALE (easy, smiling) Very. 
SERVING GIRL Do you need any more of this? 
DALE No, thanks. Just turn down the light a bit, would you? I'm shy. 
The SERVING GIRL leans over the bed to do so. We GLIMPSE DALE'S HAND rising quickly to deliver a karate-chop. 
INT. PALACE HALLWAY 
MING walks down it toward a closed door at the end. He pauses a moment in anticipation, composes himself, opens the door. 
INT. MING'S BEDCHAMBER 
It's nearly dark. MING comes from shadows, looks down at the bed. There is a feminine silhouette on it. 
MING sits, extends a hand. His FINGERS travel sensuously up a BARE THIGH, suddenly stop. 
Savagely, MING pulls the face of the GIRL into the light. It is not DALE ARDEN but the unconscious SERVING GIRL, now dressed in DALE'S gown. 
INT. DUNGEON - MING' S PALACE (GUARD) 
OPENING CLOSE on ZARKOV, who lies asleep in his chains. A hand touches his shoulder. 
ZARKOV wakes with a start to SEE a SERVING GIRL bending over him, tray in hand. She moves her cloak to reveal that she is DALE. 
A GUARD stands nearby against a wall, faceless in the shadow of a cowled uniform. 
GUARD Serving Girl - what business have you in this dungeon? 
DALE quickly puts the tray down, stands and turns to the GUARD She smiles invitingly, lifts her skirt up above her knee. 
The legs are long and terrific. 
The GUARD catches his breath, steps toward her lecherously to accept the invitation. WHAM! He doubles up as DALE kicks him in the groin, goes down without a sound as a left-right- left series of KARATE CHOPS hits his neck. 
He is hardly on the floor before DALE is pouncing on the key- ring at his belt. 
EXT. ARBORIA FOREST - FLASH AND AURA (AURA, FLASH) 
Making their way swiftly through it between earth and heaven, crossing this green world on branches and trunks of monster vines. FLASH pauses. 
FLASH Listen -- are you sure this Barin will help me? 
Gently, provocatively, AURA puts her finger on his lips to silence him. 
AURA Ssssh...... Trust me! 
EXT. ARBORIA - FULL SHOT (AURA, FLASH) 
Of a fantastic structure, many levels, built of wood and other materials from the heart of the forest. 
MOVE OFF it to find FLASH and AURA nearby, him gazing at this apparition with a strange wistful expression. 
FLASH It's amazing -- I dreamed of this tree-house when I was a kid -- 
AURA laughs softly, waves him on. 
WITH FLASH AND AURA 
climbing the ramp-like stairs which wind up around it in a mounting spiral. SUddenly the forest rings with SINGSONG CRIES and CALLS I mingled with a sort of ROARING SNARL. 
AURA It's Barin's hunt! Watch! 
AURA leads him on at a run to the wide balcony above. 
AURA It's so long since I've been with you, Barin -- I couldn't stand it. Please don't be too angry at me for coming. 
BARIN Angry at you? 
BARIN laughs. 
INT. LODGE (AURA, BARIN, FLASH) 
FLASH is flattened against the wall, IWATCHING through louvers of a door. SOUND of feet on ramp, SNARLING and ROARING of captive TIGER MAN. BARIN comes hastening INTO VIEW on the balcony and embraces AURA. 
AURA AND BARIN CLOSE 
BARIN You'll stay the night? 
AURA I've dreamed of it! 
His eyes alight with anticipation, BARIN steps back from her. as his MEN arrive with the netted TIGER MAN. 
BARIN Get me a sword -- (turning to AURA) This is the fiercest Tiger Man we have ever hunted. I'm going to kill him now -- and dedicate his blood to you, my beloved. 
AURA (DELIGHTED) But that's treason! Blood can be dedicated to Ming alone! 
BARIN I know you, Aura -- the more a man risks, the greater your passion. If I knew a greater risk, I'd take it. 
AURA SMILES, turns and calls softly toward the interior. 
AURA Flash Gordon -- come out! 
FLASH steps out, halts about ten feet from BARIN. Reactions from BARIN and his TREE MEN. 
FLASH I'm from Earth, Prince Barin. My friends and I were Ming's prisoners. She kindly brought me here to enlist your help. 
BARIN What in hell? My help? 
AURA Hide him from my father -- don't let him wander -- keep him for me! 
CU - FLASH 
FLASH Keep me for.....???? (STUNNED) Oh, my god. I trusted you. 
AURA darts INTO SHOT, puts her lips to his ear and WHISPERS: 
AURA You still must -- I'm playing a game! 
CU BARIN 
BARIN What? What are you saying? 
AURA darts back into shot on his side now, WHISPERS in same WAY: 
AURA He's a mere toy to me, my love -- when I'm tired of it we'll kill him! 
BACK TO SCENE 
as AURA quickly steps away, continues aloud: 
AURA (CONT'D) It's the risk I ask, Barin hide him for me in Arboria. 
BARIN I'll hide him, all right -- under six feet of Arborian dirt! 
The sword BARIN ordered has been brought. He seizes it. 
FLASH I'm not your enemy, Prince Barin. we share a hatred of Ming 
AURA Are you so afraid of my Earthling, Barin; Won't you even give him a chance? 
FLASH What are you waiting for? 
BARIN glares at him, takes a breath, jams his hand into the fourth of the six holes. 
BIG CU BARIN 
His eyes widen horribly, he makes a choked sound. PULL BACK FAST as he whips his hand out, unbitten. His face twists into a grin. 
BARIN Fooled you, didn't I? 
AURA laughs, turns her smile on FLASH. 
AURA It's an even chance now, Flash Gordon -- that's better than Daddy would have given you -- 
FLASH Boy. You oughta be handled with a forked stick yourself. 
BARIN If I were you, I'd choose the sword -- 
The point touches FLASH again. Just two holes left. He does a silently mouthed eeny-meeny-miney-mo between them, plunges his hand into one. 
INSIDE THE STUMP 
The snake's head MOVES fast. 
BACK TO SCENE 
QUICK CU - FLASH'S FACE 
Wincing, contorting. 
As FLASH whips his arm out again. Amazingly, he has hold of the terrible serpent, grasping it just below the head. CRIES from the astounded TREE MEN, and then FLASH is leaping INTO ACTION. 
Whirling, FLASH swings the hissing snapping writhing beast at the nearest TREEMEN, scattering them, and thrusts the serpent's head at BARIN. 
BARIN slashes with his sword, misses. The serpent's tail coils around the blade, rips it from BARIN'S hand as the Prince of Arboria dives backwards. 
FLASH whirls again, SLAMS the serpent's head into a post, and SNATCHES the sword from the tail before it hits the floor. 
MOVING WITH FLASH 
He dashes for the ramp to the ground.. The TIGER MAN is right in front of him, struggling in the net. FLASH pauses, SLASHES at the cords. TIGER MAN is freed, bounds to his feet with a ROAR, clobbers a pair of TREE MEN just jumping on him and FLASH. Snatching one's CROSSBOW and QUIVER OF GLASS ARROWS, he races down the ramp behind FLASH. 
BACK TO TOP LEVEL 
FEATURE BARIN 
Picking himself up, wheeling furiously on AURA, who has been watching all this with her lips half parted, her tongue flicking teeth in supersensuous excitement. 
BARIN (CONT'D) A mere toy of yours, eh? 
AURA (TAUNTING) Maybe I was wrong -- surely the Prince of Arboria wouldn't be beaten by a toy. 
BARIN snatches a horn from his belt, blows a BLAST. 
BARIN The hunt's on, my Tree Men! 
TREE MEN To the hunt with Barin! 
EXT. FOREST - FLASH AND TIGER MAN (FLASH, TIGER MAN) 
They run through the green tangle. FLASH trips over a vine. TIGER MAN picks him up. 
TIGER MAN Thank you for freeing me. 
FLASH You can speak? 
A DOZEN TREE MEN come swinging into view on vines, land on a fat branch. The LEADER looks right in this direction, points and gives a chilling BIRDCALL. The TREE MEN unsling their crossbows, reach for GLASS ARROWS. 
FLASH and TIGER MAN 
SEEING cold death staring them in the face. 
FLASH reaches for an arrow, notches it. 
TREE MAN LEADER You haven't a chance! Throw down your weapon! 
FLASH makes like to throw his crossbow away. At the last instant, h swings it around, aims and FIRES. 
TREE MEN ON BRANCH 
Are startled as the arrow WHIRRS in and sticks into the branch under their feet. The branch instantly turns to ICE. 
BARIN - CLIMBING FROM BELOW 
HEARS a loud brittle CRACKING SOUND. He looks up, gapes, holds on tight to the tree trunk. A dozen SHRIEKING TREE MEN plummet down around him amidst chunks of ICE, crashing through the branches to doom. A look of fierce delight on his face, BARIN resumes his climb. 
EXT. TREETOPS OF ARBORIA (FLASH, TIGER MAN) 
FLASH and TIGER MAN jump from their basket into a wide leaf, near a loading platform where the elevator-vine goes around a great iron wheel. The forest is open to the sky at this altitude, a sunny Eden of huge exotic flowers. Enormous overlapping leaves form a floor FLASH and TIGER MAN can stand on. 
FLASH Which way to the border: 
TIGER MAN Legend says Arboria ends in an ocean to the west. 
FLASH quickly checks his wristwatch and the angle of the shadows, starts in the direction he estimates is west. 
TREETOPS OF ARBORIA - OTHER ANGLES 
FLASH and TIGER MAN running over the leaves, which are somewhat BOUNCY like a huge trampoline. It's quite enjoyable. FLASH laughs aloud at the sensation, takes a big jump off the edge of one leaf, BOUNCES HIGH from the next. 
Amazingly, a fat TENDRIL seizes him in mid-air, coils around his waist. FLASH yells as he is lifted further up. 
AN ENORMOUS FLOWER 
is right above him. The closed petals open. The inside is viscous, hideous looking. In the deepest recess is a dark red blob which PULSES like a huge heart, emits a BEING SOUND. With horror, FLASH realizes the tendril is feeding him into the flower's maw. 
PLASH struggles vainly against the tendril's strength. TIGER MAN dashes to his rescue below, but another tendril knocks him flat. 
INT. FLOWER (BARIN, FLASH) 
FLASH is conveyed INTO the flower. He punches wildly with his fists, kicks, but petals are CLOSING inexorably around him. On their inner surface are deadly spiny SPIKES. Scattered around are the crushed SKELETONS of luckless TREE MEN who have been fed in here. 
SWISH-PFFFFST! Out of nowhere a GLASS ARROW comes flying past FLASH'S ear, sinks itself into the flower's heart. The flower SHRIEKS. All around, FLASH, it is turning into crystalline ICE. 
The tendrils lose their grip, FLASH falls onto the leaf below beside the TIGER MAN. 
TREETOPS - ANOTHER ANGLE 
As FLASH turns his head to see BARIN standing with his crossbow on a leaf some twenty feet away. 
BARIN I saved you because your death must be mine. 
FLASH What's the point of all this killing? Why don't we team up and overthrow Ming? 
BARIN notches another arrow, cocks his bow, with slow pleasure raises it and aims at FLASH'S heart. Suddenly a SHADOW covers BARIN. He jerks his head up to SEE: 
A WINGED SILHOUETTE 
Diving from the sun at him. It is a HAWKMAN, magnificiently fierce. It seizes BARIN in its talons and lifts him INTO THE AIR. 
OTHER HAWKMEN 
ZARKOV (CONT'D) Neat trick. I wonder if it's controllable? 
SHADOW over them suddenly. Great WHIRRING of wings. DALE Looks up and SCREAMS. 
HAWKMEN 
Swoop down on ZARKOV and DALE, bear them aloft as they did with FLASH AND TIGER MAN. 
INT. MING'S DOME ROOM (KLYTUS, MING) 
CU MING 
In his wonderous DOME ROOM, watching something. PULL BACK. KLYTUS is beside him as usual. ANGLE to include the VIEWING SCREEN which MING is watching. On it is a directional continuation of the scene we just saw: a struggling DALE being Carrie dup into the open sky by HAWKMEN. 
KLYTUS Mongo is restless today. Your vessels stray from their appointed kingdoms.... 
MING That damned Vultan -- time I clipped his wings once and for all. We could put those insolent Hawkmen of his to work in the plasma cavern ---- 
KLYTUS Dale Arden and Flash Gordon? Will I send out the Imperial Fleet to bring them back? 
MING We'll let Vultan tame her first -- I'll look pretty to Dale Arden after him. Flash Gordon is nobody. 
KLYTUS smiles that sinister way. MING looks at him questioningly. 
KLYTUS Sire, it is not for me to tell Great, Ming that he is making mistakes. 
EXT. SKY - WIDE SHOT (HAWKMAN, TIGER MAN) 
Serried squadrons of HAWKMEN escort the ones bearing FLASH, BARIN and TIGER MAN through space. 
CLOSER - TIGER MAN 
Struggling against the TWO HAWKMEN who have him, snarling and roaring. He butts one in the belly with his horn. 
HAWKMAN Want us to let you go, et? 
TIGER MAN Yes!! 
HAWKMAN Okay. 
TIGER MAN Nooo!!! 
SKY - WIDE PANORAMA 
Light streams rough tremendous El Greco clouds. HAWKMEN Are tiny figures, rising against it. 
Higher, higher. Above the clouds a blinding DAZZLE comes INTO FRAME. It resolves into a fantastic SKY PALACE hanging in mid-air, reflecting sunlight from myriad turrets and terraces. The HAWKMEN climb above it. 
CLOSER HAWKMEN 
Carrying FLASH and BARIN and TIGER MAN , going into a screaming dive. 
EXT. SKY PALACE - HAWKMEN POV 
Rushing at us with horrifying speed. ZOOMING DOWN we see a dark opening. The wind howling around wings, we rush dizzingly into the aperture. 
EXT. SKY PALACE - VULTAN'S EYRIE - A HIGH TERRACE (DALE) 
VULTAN circles admiringly around DALE. VULTAN is a lusty viking of the sky, winged like his men, one eye blinded, his beard cloven by an old scar from forehead to jaw. Gorgeous HAWKGIRLS watch jealously as VULTAN inspects DALE very closely, reaches out a sly hand and touches her bosom. DALE slaps his hand away. 
DALE Watch out, you old bird -- Ming wants to marry me. 
VULTAN hoots at that as HAWKGIRLS murmur. He's about to touch her again when there is a CLAMOR o.s. VULTAN reacts. 
EXT. SKY PALACE - ANOTHER LEVEL (BARIN, DALE, FLASH, SARIN, VULTAN, ZARKOV, ZAAKOV) 
FLASH We're all Ming's prisoners. I say let's team up and smash him. 
TIGER MAN (O.S.) Listen to his words! -- 
ANOTHER TERRACE - TIGER MAN 
On his feet on the other terrace, shouting across: 
TIGER MAN (CONT'D) I know -- I'm only an ignorant Tiger Man -- but I tell you Flash Gordon is the leader we've waited for! 
BACK TO VULTAN'S TERRACE 
Where VULTAN gazes at TIGER MAN a beat, then turns mocking eyes on FLASH. 
VULTAN You're a leader, he? 
FLASH Well, back home it's what I'm paid for -- I called a pretty good game against the Dallas Cowboys once --- 
VULTAN (TO BARIN) Do you understand him? 
BARIN Not a word. (LIKE ICE) I was hunting him when you seized me. Before you finish me. Vultan I beg only that you let me finish him. 
FLASH Oh god -- here we go again -- 
DALE Is everyone on Mongo CRAZY? Haven't you guys ever heard of TEAMWORK? 
FLASH (TO BARIN) When I had that damn snake in my hand, I could've poked it in your face and KILLED you. 
BARIN I had you in bow-sight you were dead! 
VULTAN Enough! (shouting to all around) These vagrants talk a brave fight, my Hawkmen! Shall we test their words? 
QUICK CUTS - HAWKPEOPLE 
CHEERING AND SHOUTING eagerly from all around: 
HAWKPEOPLE Test them! -- Let's have sport! The joust! -- To the joust! -- 
CU VULTAN 
VULTAN Take them below -- put them together. 
INT. SKY PALACE - A RAMP (DALE, FLASH, ZARKOV) 
VULTAN leads the way down. FLASH, BARIN, DALE, ZAAKOV and TIGER MAN are escorted by many fierce HAWKMEN. 
DALE Flash - don't do this. 
FLASH (low, bitter) I've got to. 
DALE Why? 
ZARKOV He has no choice, Dale it's the Mongo way. 
DALE I'm so homesick -- what I wouldn't give for a nice quiet night with some muggers in Central Park -- 
FLASH squeezes DALE'S hand. 
Ahead appears an archway opening to the sky. A GREAT GONG is heard. 
ANOTHER TERRACE 
ANGLE - HAWKMAN appears with a mallet, he beats again on a huge bronze GONG. 
EXT. SKY PALACE - WIDE SHOT 
He flies at BARIN, dodges the lash, grapples with him hand- to-hand. 
They wrestle their way tot he very rim of the swaying tilting surface. It looks bad again for FLASH, when with a superhuman effort he flips BARIN over his back... over the edge! 
In the same instant, FLASH dives onto his side amidst the deadly knives and grabs at BARIN'S wrist. 
FLASH catches him. BARIN hangs suspended over the abyss of space held only by FLASH'S grip. 
VULTAN You've won, Earthling! Drop him to doom! 
FLASH (gasping at BARIN) Try to catch my wrist! -- the other one. 
VULTAN What is this?? 
ZARKOV Call it what you want, Vultan -- compassion -- mercy: let us teach you the meaning of these words. 
FLASH (TO BARIN) Swing your body -- see if you can get a leg up here! 
Suddenly an ECHOING VOICE BOOMS from the sky: 
MING'S VOICE Vultan! Hear Ming, Ruler of the Universe! 
INT. MING'S DOME (AURA, MING, MING'S VOICE, VULTAN, ZARKOV) 
Where MING watches the SKY PALACE SCENE on a viewing screen, a weeping AURA beside him, as he goes on: 
MING I see you, Vultan -- and Barin too! You both have defied we by sparing these Earthlings! 
AURA Barin -- my only -- I swear I didn't mean to get you into this! 
FEATURE VULTAN 
As the VOICE goes on: 
MING'S VOICE Do you want to live, Vultan? 
VULTAN What creature wants to die? 
MING'S VOICE Then kill Flash Gordon now! Pick up Dale Arden, deliver her to me on your own wings -- it's your only chance! My fleet is already in the air, ready to destroy your whole Kingdom if you disobey! 
The ECHO rolls and dies. 
DISC 
TIGER MAN suddenly leaps out onto the disc, slides over between the knives, helps FLASH pull BARIN up to safety. 
AS BEFORE 
ZARKOV in his chains, walks over to the confused VULTAN... QUIETLY: 
ZARKOV What'll you have -- death or dishonor? 
VULTAN looks down at FLASH once more, then makes up his mind. He shouts to his people: 
VULTAN We'll save these Earthlings! - Curse Ming! -- Into the air, my Hawkpeople - fly! 
ZARKOV grins, extends a hand to VULTAN. He just looks at it. 
VULTAN (CONT'D) I don't understand this. I think I've gone mad. 
INT. MING'S DOME (AURA, MING) 
MING snaps off the viewing screen, looks at AURA 
AURA Spare him Daddy -- oh please spare BARIN -- 
DALE Fit me with what? 
HEDONIA Your wedding dress. 
EXT. ARBORIA - VINCINITY OF LODGE 
TREE MEN and LION MEN and TIGER MAN toil together in peaceful concernt, constructing a crude wooden launch-gantry around ZARKOV'S SPACE CAPSULE, which has been conveyed here. 
Several hovering HAWKMEN hold it in position with vine cables as the work is completed. Capsule door is open. Through it we see ZARKOV at work inside, feverishly re-wiring a control panel. 
EXT. LODGE BALCONY (BARIN, FLASH, VULTAN, ZARKOV'S VOICE) 
Up on Lodge Balcony, FLASH, BARIN and VULTAN lean over a table on which maps and drawings are laid out, a typical military staff meeting. With a bit of charcoal, BARIN sketches a semi-circular line over a map of MING'S city. 
BARIN A force-field covers the whole city, from here to here. With luck, Flash can lure them into lowering their defenses. 
VULTAN What if he fails? (ABRUPTLY) This is suicide, Barin! I can't order my men to suicide! 
VULTAN ascends into the air. Hovers as he goes on: 
VULTAN (CONT'D) The flight brought me back to my senses -- good luck and goodbye. 
BARIN Ming destroyed your kingdom! 
VULTAN We'll build another. 
BARIN Vultan! 
FLASH Let him go -- I understand. (up to Vultan) Thanks anyway for getting us this far! 
VULTAN hesitates a moment, the soars away with determination. 
ZARKOV'S VOICE Flash! Ready for a test! 
INT. CAPSULE (FLASH, ZARKOV) 
FLASH ENTERS 
FLASH What's the game-plan? 
ZARKOV Sit there. When I give you zero, punch that button. Any questions? 
EXT. CAPSULE (BARIN, FLASH'S VOICE, ZARKOV) 
ZARKOV jumps out, leaving the door open. He crouches low. BARIN and VULTAN and EVERYBODY are watching. 
ZARKOV Five, four, three, two, one -- ZERO! 
Interior of the capsule is filled with BLINDING BLUE LIGHT for an instant. ZARKOV pops up, sticks his head in. 
ZARKOV (CONT'D) Flash! (NO REPLY) Do you hear me, Flash? Where are you? 
CU ZARKOV 
As INVISIBLE HANDS turn around the helmet on his head. 
ZARKOV (CONT'D) Eureka! I did it! You can come out now, Flash -- 
FLASH'S VOICE Not unless you get out of my way, I CAN'T -- 
BACK TO MAIN SCENE - EXT. CAPSULE 
ZARKOV moves inside. 
BARIN Look -- he still casts a shadow: 
Capsule sits in its launch-gantry, amidst the ruined blight left by the ray attack. There is not a soul in sight. Then Flash's SHADOW moves quickly over the ground toward the Capsule and VANISHES into the hatch. The door shuts itself. 
INT. CAPSULE 
Control levers move. A red button depresses itself. Through the side, which we should remember is transparent from within, we SEE the scene outside going into a GREEN-BROWN BLUR as the capsule starts to spin for takeoff. 
INT. MING'S BEDCHAMBER (KLYTUS, MING) 
MING is being robed by TWO GIRL ATTENDANTS. Suddenly KLYTUS is there in a shadow, smiling. MING senses him, turns. 
MING Well? What is it this time? 
KLYTUS I can't remember. I feel danger -- but I cannot see it. 
MING Klytus, you're impossible. Aura deserves you. 
KLYTUS I foresee another thing. In one minute exactly, the Earthling space capsule will be seen on the scanner. 
KLYTUS is swallowed again in shadow. 
EXT. ZARKOV'S CAPSULE - IN FLIGHT 
Sailing over the ever frozen Moon of FRIGIA 
INT. MING'S DOME (CAPTIN, MING) 
Capsule is SEEN on the viewing screen, grid-lines dancing over the image as FRIGORIA is left behind. Watching are MING, KLYTUS, the CAPTAIN and several other SOLDIERS. 
CAPTIN Shall I disintegrate it, Your Majesty? 
MING No, Captain -- bring it in. Land it to a warm reception. 
INT. ZARKOV'S CAPSULE - IN FLIGHT (FLASH'S VOICE) 
Through the front we see MING'S CITY dead ahead and below. Numbers flash on the navigation display, constantly changing. 
INVISIBLE HAND picks up a microphone, holds it before INVISIBLE LIPS. 
FLASH'S VOICE Vultan! Do you read me? 
EXT. ARBORIA - IN A BROWN BLASTED TREE (FLASH'S VOICE, VULTAN) 
VULTAN and some other HAWKMEN perch, listening to VOICE coming from a radio in VULTAN'S belt. 
FLASH'S VOICE Flash Gordon calling Vultan! Over! 
VULTAN doesn't stir a feather. After a moment: 
FLASH'S VOICE (CONT'D) Okay, don't answer -- I'm on Hawkman frequency I know you are reading me. Now get this -- 
CAPSULE AND TREE IN ARBORIA 
INTERCUTS 
FLASH'S VOICE (CONT'D) I'm being guided through the force- field under their control. You're on the beam when you've got the tops of two towers lined up exactly -- the high gold one behind the green one with the blue flag got that? (SILENCE) Okay, Vultan, it's your decision the ball is in your court -- I hope I'll be seeing you, you crazy ole bird. 
The microphone hangs itself up on the panel. 
VULTAN AND HIS HAWKMEN 
Just sit there, grim-faced. VULTAN shake his head. 
VULTAN He calls us crazy -- 
EXT. PALACE BATTLEMENTS (GUARD CAPTAIN, KLYTUS) 
INT. DUNGEON (FLASH'S VOICE) 
ZARKOV, BARIN and TIGER MAN lie in chains, heads cocked at SOUNDS of the facas outside. THUD of a body falling, brief silence, then sound of a KEY IN THE LOCK. 
The door opens itself. 
FLASH'S VOICE It's me! 
INT. NARROW VERTICAL SHAFT (BARIN, FLASH'S VOICE, ZARKOV) 
The Same one AURA and FLASH fell down originally. Now BARIN, ZARKOV, TIGER MAN and FLASH are inching their way UP it like mountain climbers doing a rock chimney; in. back-to-back pairs, feet pressed out against the shaft walls. What makes it look even stranger, half of the FLASH-BARIN twosome is INVISIBLE. Low conversation as they pant and struggle up the SHAFT: 
ZARKOV How do we get down to the plasma level? 
FLASH'S VOICE Anti-gravity shaft -- I got a guard to show me -- 
BARIN This won't be easy, Flash -- 
FLASH'S VOICE Nothing's easy on Mongo -- 
INT. PLASMA CAVERN (CONTROLLER, GUARD CAPTAIN) 
LIZARD MEN SLAVES work like mad, shoveling radioactive fuel into the seething mass. 
ON THE MEZZANINE 
CONTROLLERS are at consoles. Many GUARDS stand around. Everyone watches a big hanging dial. Its needle quivers with each flare-up from the inferno below, inches toward a RED SECTOR. 
GUARD CAPTAIN Faster! -- More fueld! 
CONTROLLER What's the hurry? 
CONTROLLER What's the hurry? 
GUARD CAPTAIN He wants to give Dale Arden the final destruction of Earth as a wedding present. 
CONTROLLERS twist the shock-knobs. 
Tortured SLAVES howl in agony. Some drop and are thrown into the fiery mass, others redouble their efforts. 
ON THE MEZZANINE 
The needle quivers upwards. MOVE OFF it to a slot-like window in back wall. There are EYES behind the glass. 
INT. CRAWLSPACE BEHIND THE MEZZANINE (BARIN, FLASH'S VOICE, TIGER MAN, ZARKOV) 
ZARKOV,BARIN and TIGER MAN crouch amidst WHIRRING ventilators, watching through the window. 
BARIN How's it look to yoU? 
ZARKOV Bad. Plasma's contracting into a critical mass. When that needle hits the red, Earth is finished. 
TIGER MAN Grrao! I'll charge down at them: 
ZARKOV and BARIN just look at him. TIGER MAN slumps out of his fighting stance. 
Low door at the back opens itself and INVISIBLE FLASH comes in. 
FLASH'S VOICE Cavern is sealed tight -- every door locked from the inside -- 
CU ZARKOV 
Hope drains from his expression. 
ZARKOV Let's face it, my friends -- without a miracle, we've lost. 
The sword slowly advances. 
FEATURE MING 
His face contorted, he flies at INVISIBLE FLASH behind the sword. FLASH parries the blow. Astonishing pyrotechnics as the blades hit each other. Shrieking MONGONS flee under showers of fire. 
INT. PLASMA CAVERN (ZARKOV) 
HAWKMEN and LIZARD MEN SLAVES engage MING'S PEOPLE. 
Aided by VULTAN and TIGER MAN, ZARKOV battles his way up to the Mezzanine Control area. He shouts down wildly: 
ZARKOV Attach the electrodes to the shovels! Pitch them into the plasma! 
INT. GREAT HALL (BARIN, DALE, KLYTUS) 
MING and FLASH 
Duel dazzlingly around the enormous throne. Suddenly FLASH starts to lose his invisibility. A pair of eyes appears, the tip of a nose, parts of limbs. 
CU DALE 
Pinned by AMAZONS, reacting to that. 
DALE Flash -- look out -- you're coming back! He can see you now, Flash! 
FLASH and MING 
FLASH pauses to look at himself, almost gets his head lopped off by a fiery slash from MING, recovers to bound up higher on the vast throne statue wheron they battle. 
PULL UP. In the f.g. the image of EARTH slowly turns and glows redder with the lightning inside the clouds. 
BARIN and KLYTUS 
Duel in another area of e Hall. A thrust by BARIN catches KLYTUS on the forehead. KLYTUS springs back, blood gushing down over his eyes. 
KLYTUS I foresaw at blow -- 
BARIN You're blinded, Klytus -- drop your sword! 
KLYTUS laughs, reaches up and throws off his helmet, WHIRLS in a lightning way to reveal 
ANOTHER FACE 
Shadowed, hideous, marked with all the evil in the universe. It's mouth emits a raging SCREAM. 
BARIN 
Lunges with horror, slashes with his sword point. 
KLYTUS'S CHEEK 
Is slashed but grotesquely does not bleed. 
BARIN and KLYTUS 
Fly at each other again, trade blows, then each catches a wrist of the other with his free hand. KLYTUS laughs horribly. 
KLYTUS You fight me in vain, Barin I do not foresee my death at your hands -- 
KLYTUS twists away, knocks BARIN'S sword out of his grasp, drives BARIN back against the wall. KLYTUS lifts his own sword, puts it at BARIN'S throat for the final thrust. 
KLYTUS'S FACE 
Suddenly changes horribly. PULL BACK. AURA is behind him, her hand on the hilt of BARIN'S sword, which she has driven into KLYTUS' back. Soundless, dead, KLYTUS falls to the floor.

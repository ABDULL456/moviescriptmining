IN DARKNESS: 
OLIVE (V.O.) The rumors of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated. 
FADE IN: 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
OLIVE PENDERGHAST (17), a cute teenager, speaks directly into the WEBCAM atop her computer. 
OLIVE Let the record show that I, Olive Penderghast, being of sound mind, ample breast size and the occasional corny knock knock joke, do enter this video blog into evidence in the case against me. Because I'm being judged by a jury of my peers, I will attempt to insert `like' and `totally' into my confession as much as possible. So here it goes... I confess I'm, in no small part, to blame for the vociferous gossip that has turned my Varsity letter scarlet, but - for anyone hoping that the sizzling details of my sordid past will provide you with a reason to lock the door and make love to a dollop of your sister's moisturizing lotion - you'll be gravely disappointed. (Beat.) Look, I just need to set the record straight and what better way to do that, than to broadcast it on the Internet. So, here it is -- Part One: The Shudder-Inducing and Cliched, However Totally False Account Of How I Lost My Virginity To A Guy At A Community College In A Neighboring Town. (Beat.) Let me just begin by saying that there are two sides to every story. This is my side, the right one. (Beat.) Like, totally. 
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 
Olive sits with her best friend, RHIANNON ABERNATHY (17), a brash teenager. It would be safe to say that these girls are definitely on the "B List" at their school. 
RHIANNON Fuck off! George is not a `sexy' name. George is like what you name your teddy bear, not the name you wanna scream out during an orgasm. 
OLIVE That's bullshit. There are lots of sexy Georges. 
RHIANNON Name three. 
Olive starts to say something, but Rhiannon interrupts her. 
RHIANNON (CONT'D) Besides Clooney. Too easy. 
OLIVE Shouldn't that alone be enough? 
RHIANNON Fine. That's one. Number two? 
OLIVE (THINKING) Okay. George... Ummmm... Reeves! 
RHIANNON Who's that? 
OLIVE Superman. From way back. He was hot. 
RHIANNON No way. Teddy bear. 
OLIVE Bullshit. Ben Affleck played him in that movie! 
RHIANNON So what? Charlize Theron played that butt-fucking-ugly lesbo serial killer. Besides he's from another century. (MORE) 
RHIANNON (CONT'D) We're speaking present day. I mean, Jesus, Mortimer was probably a sexy name in some era. 
OLIVE George Stephanopolous. 
RHIANNON What are you? Fifty? 
OLIVE (THINKING HARD) George... 
RHIANNON Bush? Yeah. He's one hot mutherfucker. Just face it. There's no such thing as a sexy George. 
OLIVE Well, mine is. So, I think we should just put this conversation to bed. 
RHIANNON Fine. Don't come. I hate you. 
Rhiannon folds her arms and pouts. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
Olive continues to narrate into her webcam. 
OLIVE Let me back up. I don't know if any of you have ever met them, but Rhiannon's parents are quite possibly the creepiest people in a four county radius. 
INT. THE ABERNATHY LIVING ROOM 
RHIANNON What's his name then? 
OLIVE (WAXING CUTE) Who? My brother? 
RHIANNON Stop stalling. You're totally trying to come up with a name. Just say it. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
Into the webcam -- 
OLIVE I'm not proud of this. Less about the lie and more about the unoriginality of it. Okay, have you guys ever watched `The Brady Bunch'? Of course you haven't. You're busy watching fake people pretend to be real on MTV. That's why I knew I could get away with it. See, there was this episode where Jan - the awkward middle child - made up a boyfriend to assuage the ridicule of her snatchy sister who had just stolen the heart of the boy that Jan loved. The name of her imaginary boyfriend WAS -- 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DAY 
OLIVE (Into the phone) George Glass. 
RHIANNON George? What kind of a fucking name is George? 
OLIVE He's pretty hot and he asked me out this weekend, so I said yes. 
Although still skeptical, she seems a tad more mollified. 
RHIANNON If you're choosing him over helping me cope with two days in the wilderness with these people who even I'm not convinced aren't serial killers, he had better be the one. You had better fucking marry him, have fucking babies with him and then take him for fucking everything he's worth. 
OLIVE Deal. 
INT. CAFETERIA - CONTINUOUS 
Rhi and Olive continue their conversation, as Rhi pops a tater tot into her mouth. 
RHIANNON (With her mouth full) You're not off the hook, you know. I want lurid details. This had better be the best date of your life to counterbalance the worst weekend of mine. 
OLIVE I'm sure you'll have a good time. 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
Rhi sits, bored and uncomfortable, while her parents smile at the campfire for an, again, awkwardly long moment. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
To her webcam -- 
OLIVE (Through the proverbial CLENCHED TEETH) Even though we now hate each other, Rhi, I really hope you're watching this. Because this part's for you. The lurid details of my weekend en flagrante delicto with the all-too- imaginary, yet surprisingly satisfying George Glass: 
Ken Nordine's beat poem `OLIVE,' (from the late 60's album `Colors'), underscored to jazz, plays as we see a montage of OLIVE'S WEEKEND: 
In her bedroom, Olive -- 
-- watches `The Notebook,' pining over Ryan Gosling. 
KEN NORDINE (V.O.) Olive. Poor thing. 
-- paints her toenails Jungle Red. 
KEN NORDINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Sits and thinks that it's drab. Sure does. Sits and sits and sits and sits and THINKS about it's olive drab drab. 
-- dances to the jazz music, but alone, in her underwear and a t-shirt that declares: `Hands off.' 
KEN NORDINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) DOESN'T KNOW that it is about to be named `Color of the Year,' by those with the nose for the new. By the passionate few. Yeah... 
-- reads TEEN PEOPLE magazine. 
KEN NORDINE (CONT'D) Olive is definitely in. EVERYTHING that can possibly mean (MORE) 
KEN NORDINE (CONT'D) anything! Anywhere! At least for a year. 
-- dances some more. 
KEN NORDINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Has got to be Olive! Did you hear that Olive? Did ya? Know what it means? Oh Olive! There'll be olive cars and olive trucks and olive chickens and olive ducks and olive socks and olive garters And olive brakes and olive starters! Olive, sorry! Olive, please! OLIVE WHATNOTS and olive trees! Olive trees? What a quaint notion... Olive trees. (CHUCKLING) Olive. 
Out of breath from dancing, she walks over and displaces the NEEDLE from the KEN NORDINE ALBUM she's playing. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
OLIVE (V.O.) (CONT'D) All I could think to myself was `Great, now I'm going to have to start wearing red lipstick and stiletto heels.' 
Battling her frustration, she goes to class. 
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Olive eats dinner with her family. 
Her father, DILL (40's), is a regular dad-kinda-guy. Her mother, ROSEMARY (40's) is heavyset with a fun disposition. Also in attendance is her `a-little-too-precious' sister, GINGER (12). 
Olive and her folks get along really well. 
OLIVE Hey, you guys know that I was here all weekend, right? 
They all nod at her. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) And you would testify to that? 
DILL (SLIGHTLY CONCERNED) What's up, sweet pea? 
OLIVE It's nothing. Just the rumor mill. 
ROSEMARY What's the rumor mill turning out these days? 
OLIVE Seriously, it's nothing. 
They continue to eat. 
ROSEMARY Don't forget your brother's staying here next weekend. 
OLIVE Why? He never comes home. 
ROSEMARY They're fumigating the dorms. And thank God for that. Last time I was there, I saw three cockroaches. 
GINGER (WHINY) Mom, can you please not say that word while I'm eating? 
ROSEMARY Sorry, hon. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
Into the webcam -- 
OLIVE Like all families, mine has a deep dark secret. And since I'm spilling all this dirt, I might as well go ahead and confess it. 
She takes a deep breath. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I'm trusting that this nugget of information isn't going to be spread around, but - okay, here it goes: My dad's name is Dill and my mother's name is Rosemary. They were so amused by this that they decided to name all of their children after -- (FEIGNING DISCOMFORT) -- edible items. (With mock emotion) My brother's name is Sage and my sister's name is Ginger. It's shocking, I know. We're like a fucking pantry, us Penderghasts! (SNAPPING BACK) But at least my parents didn't meet at a `Star Trek' convention, BITCH! Sorry. Now, I'm just being mean. Okay. Back to the story. 
INT. HALLS OF BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
As Olive walks through school, she is met with a totally different energy. She no longer blends in. Guys are checking her out. Girls are glaring at her, scornfully. 
She's kind of digging it. 
OLIVE (V.O.) So, while I would never have classified myself as a wallflower, I was now the center of attention and who doesn't love that? Jeez, if I'd known that losing my virginity would create such a new persona for myself, I'd have lied about it back in eighth grade. Eighth grade sucked. I did get my first kiss back then, however. It was gross and kind of turned me off to the whole my-tongue-in-other- people's-mouths thing. Not to mention, the even-worse other- people's-tongues-in-MY-mouth thing. Seriously, folks. Who invented kissing? Why is everyone so dead- set on sticking their body parts in other people's orifices? If there's a hole on a person, rest assured, somebody wants to stick something of theirs in it. 
INT. CLOSET 
In almost complete darkness, a very nervous EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE (13) sits with a scared shitless EIGHTH GRADE KID (13). 
You can hear other PRE-TEENS snickering and whispering outside the door. 
EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE So, I think this is the part where you're supposed to stick your tongue in my mouth. It's just what I've heard. 
EIGHTH GRADE KID Just give me a second, okay? 
Olive presses a button and her watch illuminates. 
EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE According to my watch, you have 382 of them. 
EIGHTH GRADE KID How do you do that? 
EIGHTH GRADE OLIVE What? 
Olive seems lost in thought. She snaps back to reality and the task at hand. 
OLIVE If I'd known that Meerkat Todd was going to turn out so hot, I probably would have cherished the moment more. I suppose just that I'm sitting here reminiscing about it means that it must have meant something. (Beat.) Yeah, so anyway - kissing's not really my thing. That's what I learned in Natalie Giblin's closet. I digress... 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
Olive half-listens in class, while her English teacher MR. GRIFFIN (early 30's), a handsome guy, lectures on `THE SCARLET LETTER.' 
OLIVE (V.O.) So, I'm feeling like the cat's ass, because everyone thinks I've been deflowered. I'm surprised at how empowered I felt by this prevarication. I wonder to myself, would I feel this invigorated if I had actually let some college kid violate me in his cockroach- infested dorm room? Probably not. (Beat.) Ironically, we were studying `The Scarlet Letter,' but isn't that always the way with these teenage tales? The literature you read in class always seems to have a strong connection with whatever angsty adolescent drama is being recounted. I consider this. (Pause.) Then I think: Except for `Huckleberry Finn.' I don't know any teenage boys who have ever run away with a big, hulking black guy. 
MR. GRIFFIN Alright, so thoughts? 
Nina raises her hand. Mr. Griffin points to her. 
NINA I think Hester Prynne was - excuse my language - a whore. 
MR. GRIFFIN You don't see her as a victim? 
NINA Why should I? She brought it on herself. 
Nina whips around and gives Olive a look, surprising her. 
OLIVE Excuse me? 
NINA Perhaps you should embroider a red A on your wardrobe? 
OLIVE Perhaps you should GET a wardrobe, you twat! 
The class bursts into surprised laughter. Even Mr. Griffin tries hard to suppress a congratulatory glance in her direction. 
OLIVE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Admittedly, not my best line. But it was provocative enough to land me in the Principal's office. 
Mr. Griffin, begrudgingly, calls her to his desk. He starts writing something on a piece of paper. 
INT. FRONT OFFICE - BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Olive sits with her arms crossed outside of the Principal's office. She clenches a note in her fist. 
Marianne, who's an office aid, has a smirk on her face as she watches Olive squirm. She slams her fist down on the stapler, repetitively. 
FINALLY -- 
MARIANNE Seems as if someone's on a downward spiral. 
OLIVE Seems as if someone's practicing the mundane activities she'll be saddled with the rest of her pathetic life. 
MARIANNE You have a chip on your shoulder the size of Texas. 
OLIVE Wow, that's even bigger than your ass. 
MARIANNE (COLDLY) You're going to hell. 
OLIVE (Growing weary of this BANTER) As long as you won't be there... 
MARIANNE Oh, I can assure you I won't. 
Neither says anything for a few moments. 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) I hope you at least had the good sense to wear a condom. 
OLIVE Why? Your parents didn't. 
MARIANNE You know, you're just like -- 
The principal's door opens and Marianne quickly shuts up and continues her work. 
TWO KIDS emerge. One, obviously, a bully; the other, obviously, the bullied. The BULLIED kid is holding a BLOODIED TISSUE up to his nose. He and Olive exchange meaningful glances. 
PRINCIPAL GIBBONS (60's), a colossal prick disguised as a man, gestures for her to come in. Olive gets up and enters -- 
INT. PRINCIPAL GIBBONS'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
He closes the door behind them. He holds his hand out and she gives him the note that Mr. Griffin wrote. Gibbons studies it. 
Her parents seem more impressed than upset. This is definitely a first. 
DILL What did you do? 
OLIVE I used inappropriate language in English class. But we're reading a book that I, personally, deem wildly inappropriate for my age group, so I felt that it was actually quite apropos. 
ROSEMARY (More curious than angry) What did you say? 
Olive looks to her little sister and thinks better of saying the word out loud. 
OLIVE Let's just say it was an inappropriate word. 
DILL What did it start with? 
OLIVE A snide comment from a snotty-ass girl in my class. 
DILL I meant what letter did it start with? 
OLIVE Oh. Yeah. T. 
ROSEMARY T? That's an odd one. Is this one of those new curse words? 
Both her parents wheels are going. They're both seeking the answer in their heads, but are coming up with nothing. 
ROSEMARY (CONT'D) Was it -- ? 
She leans over and whispers something in her daughter's ear. 
OLIVE I don't even know what that means. 
ROSEMARY Yeah. Neither do I. 
Her parents search their brains, but nothing is coming to them. 
DILL Okay. Noun, adjective or verb? 
OLIVE Noun. Definitely slang. Think British, although they pronounce it differently. 
ROSEMARY Well, I'm stumped. Whisper it in my ear. 
OLIVE I can't. Too weird. 
Excited by the prospect -- 
ROSEMARY Oo! Oo! Spell it with your peas! 
OLIVE Now, THAT'S a challenge. 
She begins maneuvering her peas around the plate. 
DILL Does this have something to do with this rumor you were talking about the other night? 
Olive touches her index finger to her nose, as she continues to manipulate her food. 
DILL (CONT'D) Is there something you want to tell us, kiddo? 
OLIVE I'm spelling it out for you as quickly as I can. 
GINGER (Desperate for attention) I got a B plus on my spelling test today. 
Too intrigued by Olive's admission to really care -- 
ROSEMARY Good, sweetheart. 
Rosemary figures it out as Olive is assembling the A. 
ROSEMARY (CONT'D) Oh, I know what it is! 
She leans over and whispers it in Dill's ear. He nods in understanding. 
GINGER (Glancing at Olive's PLATE) What's a twat? 
Olive quickly scrapes the peas into a pile. 
Olive laughs to herself. 
BULLIED KID What? 
OLIVE I was just thinking it's kind of funny. We haven't really talked since that closet incident back in eighth grade. 
BULLIED KID I was afraid you were going to bring that up. 
OLIVE So, how have you been, Brandon? 
BRANDON (DRYLY) I have been fantastic. (MORE) 
BRANDON (CONT'D) Really, really amazing. Don't know if you heard, but according to my locker, I'm a `power bottom.' 
OLIVE Yikes. 
BRANDON Yeah, only two days after the custodians had finally gotten around to scrubbing `turd burglar' off. Which, if you think about it, really contradicts the previous label. 
OLIVE Maybe your vandal is marvelling at your versatility? 
Brandon shoots her a `that's not funny' look. 
BRANDON But, of course, I'm in detention. 
OLIVE Why? 
BRANDON Because Gibbons is a homophobe. (Beat.) And I called him a facist. 
OLIVE So, the rumors are true, huh? 
BRANDON (INCREDULOUS) Have you ever met me? 
OLIVE No. I meant about Gibbons being a facist. 
He laughs. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I kind of guessed it that night with the whole kissing thing. The way you ran away. I remember thinking to myself, `this isn't the first time this kid's going to go bursting out of the closet.' 
BRANDON Gold star for you, Nancy Drew. 
There's a brief silence between them. 
OLIVE You know, I read this article that said with this whole EMO movement, it looks like - that in a few years - the gay kids are going to be the most popular ones in school. 
BRANDON Oh good. I'll come back when I'm twenty seven for my redo. 
Ignoring his cynicism -- 
OLIVE Can you imagine the dance squad full of shirtless guys in tight pants rocking out to Britney, while the football players sit on the sidelines wishing they were that cool? 
BRANDON That'll be the day. (Beat.) Judging from the new look you're sporting, I'm not the only one in a transformative stage. `Sup with the whore couture? 
OLIVE (PROUDLY) Haven't you heard? I'm the new school slut! 
BRANDON As a matter of fact I did hear that. I heard you banged a guy twice your age. 
OLIVE No way. He's a freshman in college. 
BRANDON Also heard he gave you crabs. 
OLIVE Ewwww. People suck. 
BRANDON Tell me about it. 
OLIVE He's not real. The guy I slept with. I made him up. 
BRANDON So, you started the rumor? 
OLIVE Indirectly? Sort of. Well, not really. No. No, I didn't. 
BRANDON But you're perpetuating it. That's fucked up. 
OLIVE (OFFENDED) Excuse me? 
She clicks over. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Hello? 
BRANDON (O.S.) Olive? 
OLIVE (SINGSONG) Unfortunately so. 
BRANDON It's Brandon. 
OLIVE Speak of the devil... 
BRANDON (O.S.) Hey, can I come over? I wanted to talk to you about something. 
OLIVE (INTRIGUED) Okay. Yeah. Sure. 
BRANDON (O.S.) Okay. See you soon. 
Olive clicks over to Rhiannon. 
OLIVE Dude, that was Brandon. He wants to talk to me about something. 
RHIANNON (O.S.) Probably wants to borrow an outfit. 
OLIVE That's so mean. 
RHIANNON (O.S.) Any word from George? 
OLIVE Rhi, I told you. It was a one night stand. Which is now a DONE night stand. 
RHIANNON (O.S.) You're being awfully cavalier about this. I mean, he popped your cherry. Aren't you supposed to be eternally in love with him and shit? 
OLIVE If I was a character on a CW show, then, absolutely, I'd be blubbering all over my Teen Vogue. Hey, we should start a rumor that I'm having a pregnancy scare! 
Olive is stoked by her idea. 
INT. FOYER - PENDERGHAST HOME - NIGHT 
Rosemary opens the door to see Brandon. She has no idea who he is. 
BRANDON Hi. Is there an Olive here? 
ROSEMARY (FEIGNING CONFUSION) There's a whole jar of them in the fridge. 
BRANDON Sorry, I must have gotten the address wrong. 
ROSEMARY Just kidding! Come on in. 
Brandon walks in and Rosemary shouts -- 
ROSEMARY (CONT'D) Olive, sweetie, there's a young man here to see you. He said something about asking for your hand in marriage. 
Brandon's eyes bulge and Olive descends the staircase. 
OLIVE Oh happy day, Mama! I thought I was going to have to spend my dowry on booze and pills to numb the loneliness. 
Olive grabs Brandon by the hand and leads him upstairs to -- 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
She closes the door behind them. 
OLIVE My mom's an acquired taste. I know this because I've only just recently begun to appreciate her myself. 
She gestures for him to sit down. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Welcome to my boudoir! This is where the magic happens. 
BRANDON (BLURTING OUT) Do you wanna go out with me? 
She looks at him, strangely. 
BRANDON (CONT'D) I mean, like -- Do you want to be my girlfriend? 
OLIVE I'm sure you all remember the party... 
INT. BOSTIC HOUSE - NIGHT 
A TEEN PARTY rages. DRUNK KIDS abound. 
Olive, looking like a million-fuckin'-bucks, prances into the party with Brandon, who's looking pretty snazzy himself. They appear drunk and are falling all over each other. 
People stare in complete amazement at a.) Their appearance and b.) That they're even together in the first place. 
You'd never guess that this was anything less than an A-LIST TEEN COUPLE, ripped from the pages of Teen People. 
Olive falls against Brandon laughing. He hoists her up, as their host, MELANIE BOSTIC (17), a fairly pretty girl, approaches. 
MELANIE Hey Olive! (WEIRDED OUT) Hi Brandon. 
OLIVE OhmiGod, Melly. I hope you don't mind, but we had a few pre-cocktail party cocktails... (DISORIENTED) Party. Cocktails. 
MELANIE Well, glad you could make it. 
OLIVE (Whispering and slurring in her ear) Soooo, here's the thing. (MORE) 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Brandon was in the middle of telling me this funny thing. Is there a quiet room we can go to where he can finish telling me -- (HICCUP) -- About his thing? That's funny? 
She stares glassy-eyed at Melanie. Brandon just smiles. 
MELANIE Sure. You can use the guest room. Down the hall. 
OLIVE I love you. I love you so much. You are -- Just, yeah. 
She gives her a drunken punch on the shoulder. 
She spins around to the entire party, who is looking at them with complete interest. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) (Loudly; to all) Hey everybody! 
They raise a glass to them and Brandon and Olive stumble down the hallway, laughing. 
MELANIE (Shocked; Mouthing to a GUEST) What the fuck?! 
The bully who emerged from Gibbons's office with Brandon, goes up to Melanie. 
BULLY Was that Olive with Brandon? 
MELANIE I know! Right? 
They, with a big group, race down the hall where Brandon and Olive have just retreated to. 
INT. GUEST ROOM - NIGHT 
Olive locks the door and drops the drunk act. She's completely sober and so is Brandon. 
OLIVE (WHISPERING) Draw the shades. 
Brandon runs over and pulls the blinds down. They giggle, conspiratorially. 
Olive plops down on the bed and stretches out. Brandon lays beside her. She moans for the benefit of the audience she knows has assembled outside. She moans again and it's very convincing. 
She leans over and whispers in his ear -- 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Grunt. Make it really convincing. And manly. 
He does so. She extends her palm, impressed. He slaps it with his. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Sure enough, it seems as if most of the party is listening at the door - falling all over each other to hear. Nearest to the door is the bully, who is pleasantly surprised by the noise inside. 
INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Olive reaches into her handbag and pulls out her copy of `The Scarlet Letter' and reads it while she makes sex noises. Brandon laughs at this and Olive smacks him with it, prompting him to stop. She puts her finger over her lips, giving him the `Shhhh' sign. 
She continues to read as she thrusts her hips, making the bed squeak ever so slightly. 
Clad in sunglasses, fuck-me-boots and looking like a bona fide porn star, Olive struts down the halls of her school. Sewn across her larger and pushed up breasts is 
A FIERY RED `A' 
(NOTE: For the rest of the film, every piece of Olive's clothing will be emblazoned with a RED A.) 
Erections are popping up all along the halls, as well as looks of total disbelief from the girls. 
She works it like a Debbie Who Just Did Dallas, Düsseldorf, Des Moines, Daytona, Detroit and Darfur. 
Up ahead, Rhiannon is yakking with a semi-attractive guy named ANSON (17). She catches sight of Olive and her jaw drops. 
Olive sidles up to Anson, much to Rhiannon's chagrin. 
OLIVE Hey, Anson. 
ANSON (NERVOUS) Hi. 
OLIVE (Breathy and aping Marilyn MONROE) I just realized the funniest thing. My name is an anagram for `I love...' 
ANSON (STUTTERING) What's an anagram? 
OLIVE Look it up, big boy. 
She rubs her knee, seductively, along his inner thigh, turns and licks her lips at a repulsed Rhiannon and continues on her way. 
INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH LINE - LATER 
Anything sexually suggestive you can do with school cafeteria food, Olive does as she makes her way through the lunch line, as guys ogle her. 
Marianne, also present in the line, watches her in repugnance. 
INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY 
Olive emerges from the GIRLS' LOCKER ROOM, dressed for gym class. A TERRIFIED FAT KID named EVAN nervously approaches her. 
EVAN Hey Olive. 
OLIVE Hi Evan. 
EVAN Can I talk to you for a second? 
He gestures for her to follow him underneath the bleachers. She reluctantly does so. 
EVAN (CONT'D) (WHISPERING) Don't get mad, but Brandon told me what you did for him. 
OLIVE Well, rest assured, it was equally as thrilling for me. 
EVAN No, he told me the truth. 
She's pissed. She silently seethes. 
EVAN (CONT'D) And I was just hoping that maybe you could do the same for me? 
OLIVE (Through clenched teeth) Walk away, Evan. 
Evan starts to talk, but she raises her hand to silence him. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) RUN away, Evan. 
EVAN I can pay you, too. 
OLIVE I'm about six seconds away from slapping you so hard that your unborn grandchildren will feel it. 
EVAN (Excited at the prospect) Can you do it in front of everyone? 
Olive turns and starts to leave. Evan summons up his courage and meekly states to her back. 
EVAN (CONT'D) I don't need your permission, you know. 
She turns around and gives him a look of death. He can't look at her. 
EVAN (CONT'D) I mean, at the rate you're going, I'm just saying I don't think anyone would not believe it. 
MR. GRIFFIN (CONT'D) (Indicating her outfit) `this' is just an act. I'm just curious why you're doing it. 
Olive drops her defenses and gets real. 
OLIVE Have you ever decided just to play along? Because it's maybe easier than fighting tooth-and-nail to defend it? 
MR. GRIFFIN I just don't want to see this (He searches for the word) damage you. 
OLIVE You know, I think you should give me extra credit for going the extra mile. I'm really attempting to understand this puritanical ostracism. 
Mr. Griffin smiles at her. 
MR. GRIFFIN Hey, I'm really sorry I had to send you to the Principal. If you tell anybody, I'll deny it, but I really wanted to cheer with the rest of the class. 
OLIVE (SMILING; INNOCENTLY) You know I won't tell. 
She gets up and leaves, but passes in the doorway, a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) (To the woman) Hey Mrs. Griffin. 
Pretending to know who she is -- 
MRS. GRIFFIN Hi! How are you? 
OLIVE (Pointing to the `A') A is for Awesome. 
Olive disappears into the empty halls. 
MRS. GRIFFIN I've never seen that girl before in my life. 
MR. GRIFFIN That doesn't surprise me. 
MRS. GRIFFIN I'm the guidance counselor. I should know all of the students. Especially the ones dressed like that. 
He kisses her. 
MR. GRIFFIN She's just going through a phase. (He gets an idea) Hey, do you think you could talk to her? Maybe you could get her to -- I dunno - 
MRS. GRIFFIN Sure. Yeah, whatever. Oh wait! That's not the girl that everyone's talking about, is it? 
MR. GRIFFIN `Fraid so. 
MRS. GRIFFIN Oh, this'll be good. That snotty office aid has been bitching about her incessantly. 
MR. GRIFFIN It's all lies. Talk to her. Maybe that's all she needs. 
MRS. GRIFFIN What are you making for dinner tonight? 
MR. GRIFFIN Is it my turn? 
MRS. GRIFFIN Sure is. I'm meeting up with the girls at happy hour. 
MR. GRIFFIN Don't have too much fun. 
MRS. GRIFFIN I never do. 
He kisses her. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
Assembled in a semi-circle, a handful of WELL-DRESSED CHRISTIAN KIDS open their meeting of the CROSS YOUR HEART CLUB with prayer. Marianne, of course, leads them in this ritual. Nina is also present. 
MARIANNE Heavenly Father, watch over us with Your all-encompassing love. Keep us on the path toward Your righteousness and eternal salvation. 
They all smile, say `AMEN' and open their eyes. 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) Guys. We have a problem. 
NINA Amen to THAT. 
MARIANNE Olive Penderghast. We need to pray for her, but we also need to get rid of her. I'm sure, by now, you've all heard about what happened at Melanie Bostic's party. 
CHRISTIAN KID #1 I was there. I heard the whole thing. 
OLIVE Am I in trouble? I promise the hem of my dress isn't higher than my fingertips. 
MRS. GRIFFIN You're not in trouble, Olive. I just wanted you to know that if there was something you maybe needed to talk about, that you could trust me. 
OLIVE If I open up to you, do you promise this stays in confidence? 
MRS. GRIFFIN Yes. 
OLIVE (CONFESSIONAL) I watch `American Idol.' Do NOT tell anyone. 
Mrs. Griffin rolls her eyes. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I have a reputation to uphold. 
MRS. GRIFFIN Don't you, though? 
Olive assesses this statement from her. 
OLIVE We done? If I can think of any angsty things to report, you'll be the first to know. 
She winks at her. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) This has been so much fun that I'm actually - at this very moment - considering meth addiction, just so I can come back and we can jaw some more. 
MRS. GRIFFIN (BITINGLY) Or you could always get pregnant? 
OLIVE I'm probably closer than either of us thinks... 
Mrs. Griffin digs in her purse and pulls out a handful of CONDOMS. Feigning excitement -- 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Propho-tastic! 
MRS. GRIFFIN Please don't tell anyone I gave you these. The school board is -- 
OLIVE Puritanical and oppressive? 
MRS. GRIFFIN Conservative. 
Olive sees that Mrs. Griffin is genuinely concerned. 
OLIVE I don't need those. 
MRS. GRIFFIN (STERNLY) But you do. 
Olive starts to confess, but then just takes the rubbers and puts them in her own purse. 
OLIVE Thank you. 
MRS. GRIFFIN Remember: our little secret. And, hey, would you send in the next person? 
Mrs. Griffin smiles at Olive as she leaves. 
INT. FRONT OFFICE - BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS 
Marianne is talking to Micah, who seems distressed. He rubs his eyes, like he's been crying. Olive is surprised to see him there. 
OLIVE You're up, hoss. 
MARIANNE (Concerned; To Micah) It's going to be okay. 
She gives him a reassuring smile and he walks into her office. 
OLIVE (TO MARIANNE) Let me guess: drugs. 
Marianne gives her a `go away' look. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I didn't know Christians believed in guidance counsellors. (Beat.) Ooo! Ooo! Is your boyfriend struggling with his sexuality? 
Marianne begins crying. 
MARIANNE No, you insensitive rhymes-with- witch! His parents are going THROUGH A (MORE) 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) (WHISPERED) divorce! 
OLIVE (V.O.) So, I guess I shouldn't be too shocked that these people wanted my diseased, home-wrecking ass out of there. 
The scene is a maelstrom of anger and piety. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
Olive laughs. 
OLIVE The funny thing is: the whole time this shit was going down - people calling me something I knew wasn't true, my best friend included - I couldn't help but think how I could have come up with better signs. No one even bothered to use alliteration or, God forbid, irony - not even a single acronym - and that seems a lot more unforgivable than my sins. 
INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY 
Olive enters a Catholic Church. It's empty, but there are a few CANDLES burning. She sees the CONFESSIONAL BOOTH and makes a beeline toward it. 
She takes a deep breath and enters. 
INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS 
She sits down and begins to talk to the screen. 
OLIVE Forgive me, father, for I have sinned. I think that's how you're supposed to start these things. I'm only going on what I've seen in the movies. Then, I think I'm supposed to tell you how long it's been since my last confession, but that's kind of my first confession. I'm not Catholic. I really don't know what I'm supposed to do, except sit here in this booth and tell you what I've done wrong. Where do I even start? (Beat.) I've been pretending to be a -- how would one phrase it in Catholic words? A harlot. It's not like I've actually been doing the things that people are saying I'm doing, but - then again - I'm not denying them, so I've just been wondering: is that wrong? There's a lot of shi -- `crap' going down at my school which may or may not be indirectly because of this masquerade. (Beat.) I'm lying. I may have caused the end of a marriage. I thought, in my own perverse way, that I could help it. I mean, in my defense, I am merely an adolescent. I should never have been propositioned in the way I was propositioned by an adult. But then again, I should never have consented. It was just that a lot of people had been asking me to do things and I thought it was okay, because it wasn't real. (MORE) 
OLIVE (CONT'D) It was make-believe and no one was getting hurt. But a lot of people hate me now. I kind of hate me, too. 
There's a long silence. Olive tears up and wipes them away. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I could be wrong, but aren't you supposed to say something or ask me questions. Tell me to say `Hail Marys'? Hello? 
She looks through the screen. There's no one there. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Oh, come on! 
She throws the curtain to the booth open and stomps out. 
EXT. CATHEDRAL PARKING LOT - DAY 
Olive, upset at herself, gets into her car and drives off. But just a few blocks down the street to -- 
EXT. PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 
She parks her car and gets out to try a different denomination. 
INT. CHURCH OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Olive enters to find a SWEET, PORTLY RECEPTIONIST (50's) searching through RELIGIOUS CLIP-ART on her COMPUTER, attempting to find the perfect image for the church newsletter. 
The lady smiles, acknowledging Olive. 
OLIVE Hi. I was wondering if the minister was around. 
RECEPTIONIST Pastor McGreevey is on vacation this week. But our associate pastor is in. Would you like to speak to him? 
For her own entertainment, Olive matches the receptionist's enthusiasm level. 
OLIVE Actually, that would be fantastic! 
RECEPTIONIST Can I tell him what this is regarding? 
OLIVE Absolutely. I'm looking for a church to join and I thought he might be able to sell me on this fine establishment. 
The receptionist joyfully snatches up the phone. 
RECEPTIONIST Don, there's a young lady here who would like to speak with you about joining. 
She listens and then hangs up. 
RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) (Pointing to an office) You can go right in. 
OLIVE If everyone here is as friendly as you, I think we might be in business. 
She winks at the receptionist and enters -- 
INT. ASSOCIATE PASTOR'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
OLIVE (V.O.) Tragedy struck in third period. 
MARIANNE Micah's in the hospital. He's in so much pain! The nurse didn't know what was wrong. 
Olive just holds her new friend, as she had the day before. 
OLIVE He'll be okay. 
MARIANNE (Tears glistening in her EYES) Really? 
Olive guides Marianne's head back to her shoulder. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
Marianne's boyfriend, Micah, writhes in pain on a hospital bed, clutching his crotch. His worried MOTHER (40's) is beside him, clutching her chest with one hand and trying to soothe him with the other. 
MICAH It hurts so bad. 
A DOCTOR enters, with a satisfied smile and a diagnosis. 
DOCTOR Chlamydia. 
Micah and his mother both look up in shock. His mother takes both of her hands and begins slapping him, uncontrollably. 
MICAH'S MOTHER How did you get chlamydia? Who have you been sleeping with? Tell me! TELL ME! 
Micah, in pain from the burning sensation and his mother's hands flying at astonishing speed shouts out: 
MICAH Olive! Olive Penderghast! 
His mother's face fills with satisfaction. 
INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER 
Micah's mother is on her cell phone. 
MICAH'S MOTHER (ANGRILY) Olive Penderghast. 
She folds her phone up and slips it into her purse. 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
The woman on the other end of the phone -- A WOMAN WITH A SMILE THE SIZE OF MONTANA -- who we've seen in the Bryant family photo, hangs up. Only this time, her smile is a disgusted grimace. 
She picks up the phone and dials a number. She is, animatedly, talking to the person on the other end of the line, while Olive narrates. 
OLIVE (V.O.) Fourth period was when Marianne had office duty. Her duties included typing, stapling, filing and -- 
INT. FRONT OFFICE - DAY 
Marianne is on the phone, listening, with mouth agape. Undoubtedly, she's just heard from her mother that her boyfriend has chlamydia. 
OLIVE (V.O.) -- answering the phones. 
MARIANNE CHLAMYDIA!! 
She screams so loud that Mrs. Griffin comes out of her office, a panicked expression on her face. 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Seething, Marianne's mother says into the phone -- 
A WOMAN WITH A SMILE THE SIZE OF MONTANA Olive Penderghast. 
She hears a slam and then a dial tone. 
INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Marianne clutches the phone in the cradle with enough force that it looks like the receiver will shatter in her hands. Mrs. Griffin looks worried. 
MRS. GRIFFIN Are you okay, hon? 
Like a teapot about to start expelling steam, Marianne quivers in rage. Finally, at boiling point, she shouts -- 
OLIVE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And I bought it. 
Olive gives her a reassuring smile, steps up to the plate and offers up a solution. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I could have chlamydia. And I could easily have given it to Micah. That time we slept together. Who knows? Often times women don't have symptoms and I have been whoring around.... 
MRS. GRIFFIN No you haven't. 
Olive looks at her, puzzled by her knowledge. 
MRS. GRIFFIN (CONT'D) (LOOKING AWAY) Because a real whore can't admit it to herself, let alone others. 
She begins to weep. 
Olive puts her hand on Mrs. Griffin's shoulder. 
OLIVE Call Micah. Tell him I said he's an asshole and that he owes me SO big for this and also the time I pretended not to see him during a third grade game of hide and seek. Tell him I still remember that. But tell him that I confessed to giving him chlamydia. 
Mrs. Griffin grabs Olive and cries on her. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) And it's not really my place to say this, but I figure after the conversation we just had, I can speak candidly. Your husband is HOT and while the male adolescent can fuck like a bunny... who really wants to fuck a bunny? If I was you, I'd go home and seduce him and pretend this never happened. 
Olive strokes her guidance counselor's hair. 
MRS. GRIFFIN (SNIVELING) Do you want some more condoms? 
OLIVE (MATERNALLY) No, you keep them. 
She strokes her hair. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
Into the webcam -- 
OLIVE So, really how could I be angry at Marianne? (MORE) 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Dude, if some bimbo gave MY boyfriend an STD, I'd have swung, but I'd have balled my fist. (WHIMSICALLY) My boyfriend. (She gets lost in the THOUGHT) With all the mythical play I was getting, it's a wonder - and probably a miracle - that I still hadn't actually been asked out on a real date. Guys were clamoring to claim that they'd slept with me, but no one was putting the real moves on me. Until finally... 
EXT. PLAYGROUND - YEARS BEFORE 
Two LITTLE 5 YEAR OLD GIRLS (Olive and Rhiannon) chase a LITTLE BOY all over the playground, desperate to kiss him. 
They plot and plan to corner him, but he's just too fast. 
OLIVE (V.O.) It was really Rhiannon who had a crush on him. She has since we were kids. 
Rhiannon finally catches him and kiss him on the cheek. Repulsed, he wipes his face. 
Rhiannon and Olive high five each other. 
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 
Olive eats her lunch and yuks it up with a table full of guys. Rhiannon sits at a different table, mostly comprised of girls, and glares at her from across the room. 
The bell rings and the students begin getting up and making their way toward the exit. 
Anson (who we saw earlier with Rhiannon in the hallways) approaches Olive. 
ANSON Hey Olive. 
Olive smiles sweetly at him. 
ANSON (CONT'D) I was wondering if you were busy tonight. Maybe wanna go out or something? 
OLIVE (SUSPICIOUS) What did you have in mind? 
ANSON I dunno. I was thinking about chartering a hot air balloon, taking along a bottle of champagne and fresh fruit and then trying to impress you with an overzealous reading of Emily Dickinson. 
OLIVE (COYLY) Why, Anson, are you inviting me to accompany you to a romantic dinner at the Red Lobster? 
ANSON Unequivocally. 
OLIVE (IMPRESSED) Nice. Yeah. I'll have dinner with you. 
OLIVE Rhiannon's over there. 
ANSON So? 
OLIVE So? She's been in love with you since the first grade. 
ANSON So? 
OLIVE Well, she's my best friend. 
ANSON I thought you two weren't speaking. 
OLIVE We're not, but it doesn't mean I should be out with you. 
ANSON Then why are you? 
OLIVE I don't know. You asked me out? 
ANSON Exactly. I have no interest in her. I mean, we're friends, but -- 
OLIVE She can't see us. 
ANSON (DISAPPOINTED) Do you want me to get the check? 
OLIVE (TOUCHED) Would you mind? 
He gestures for the server who appears. 
ANSON Could we get our check? 
SERVER (CONFUSED) Is everything okay? 
OLIVE I just remembered I'm allergic to shellfish. I always forget that my respiratory system would collapse and I'd die. It sucks I know. 
Even more confused, the server obliges and gives them their check. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) (Digging in her purse) Let me get it. I have a gift certificate. 
She pulls it out and hands it to the waitress, who leaves. 
ANSON But I asked you out. 
OLIVE And I ruined it, so let me bear the financial brunt. (Beat.) I'm so sorry about this. But she really likes you. 
ANSON She and I just don't have much in common. 
OLIVE And you and I do? 
ANSON I think so. For instance, I, too think Nina Howell's a twat. 
OLIVE Yeah, well, if that's our magical connection, I should date the entire school. 
ANSON Haven't you? 
Olive suddenly becomes self-conscious and a little bit pissed. 
ANSON (CONT'D) Kidding! 
OLIVE Yeah, about that -- 
The server reappears with the check. 
SERVER You have a remaining balance of fourteen dollars and thirty six cents. 
OLIVE Keep it. Tip. 
The sever smiles and leaves them again. 
ANSON Let's get out of here. 
They duck out of the booth trying to keep their heads down, but Olive can't resist the urge to look up and see if Rhiannon sees them. 
She does. 
MR. GRIFFIN What? 
The gravity of what she's just done sinks in and she stumbles. 
OLIVE I -- I'm sorry. I -- 
Not knowing what to say, she runs from his classroom. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
Olive is mirthless, as she proceeds with her story. 
OLIVE Looking back, that's the thing I regret the most. That's the thing that sent me to the church, er, churches. And that's the thing that made me realize how profoundly I'd fucked up. (MORE) 
OLIVE (CONT'D) And that's something I'll have to live with for the rest of my life. With my words, even though they were true, I ended a marriage. No kid should have to be burdened with that. 
She contemplates this. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
As we saw before, Olive sits and plays `CONNECT FOUR' with Mr. Griffin, at his desk. Both are looking beaten down and very depressed and their minds are on everything but the game. 
Mr. Griffin puts his hand on Olive's. 
MR. GRIFFIN It's not your fault. 
Olive gets a tear in her eyes. She puts a RED CHIP in at the top and loses the game. She reaches over and presses the lever, causing all of the chips to fall on his desk. 
CUT TO: 
THE JENGA SET-UP 
There's a ridiculously tall tower of blocks and they all fall down. 
CUT TO: 
He rakes the chips and the game into his own cardboard box, full of his things. 
He smiles and she hugs him -- intensely, tears quickly welling up in her eyes. 
OLIVE I'm so sorry. 
MR. GRIFFIN No. It's not your fault. 
They just hold each other. Finally, Mr. Griffin pulls away and takes his things and starts to leave. But then he turns and says -- 
MR. GRIFFIN (CONT'D) I hope that you and Todd end up okay. 
OLIVE Me too. Where are you going? 
MR. GRIFFIN Not sure yet. Away from her. 
OLIVE Can I come? 
They share one last, pained smile and he leaves. 
INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - PRESENT DAY 
Hearfelt, into the webcam -- 
OLIVE Mr. Griffin, if you ever see this, just know - I was wrong to tell you that. In that way. At all. I don't know. I shouldn't have done it. I don't feel bad for lying for your wife. But I hate myself for telling you the truth. I'm so sorry. 
She wipes away a tear, pulls herself together. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Part Five: Not With a Whimper But With a Bang. 
EXT. BARBARA BUSH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
As we saw before -- 
The Cross Your Heart Club is assembled outside of the school, with a lot of other kids (and some parents), waving signs on wooden stakes that say things like: 
EXPEL OLIVE! 
INT. GYM - DAY 
We join a pep rally, already in progress. 
The DANCE TEAM attempts to rile up the school with a rousing rendition of Michael Jackson's `BAD.' 
In the stands, Rhi sits with Marianne and Nina. 
MARIANNE So, Olive wasn't at school today. 
She extends her palms to Nina and Rhi, who both slap them. Marianne puts her arm around Rhi. 
MARIANNE (CONT'D) I'm so glad you're with us now. 
RHIANNON Me too. You guys fucking rock. 
MARIANNE We don't say that word, Rhiannon. 
NINA (HELPFULLY) Just say `effing' instead. We effing rock. 
Marianne nods in agreement, however Rhi is confused. 
RHIANNON But isn't that just implying the same word? 
MARIANNE Oh, Rhiannon. We have so much to teach you. It's okay to imply things. 
Rhiannon looks at her new best friends, who just smile at her. 
The song ends and there's a drum roll. 
RHIANNON Yay! It's time for Meerkat Todd. (SEXUALLY) I just want to rip that costume off him and -- 
Marianne puts her hand firmly on Rhi's knee. 
MARIANNE Why don't you just not talk for a while, okay hon? 
Rhi puts her head down. 
The drum roll ends and Meerkat Todd bounces out in costume. He jumps around enthusing the student body -- 
But then he goes out of the gym and reenters pushing a DUMPSTER. 
The familiar chords of the James Bond theme `Nobody Does It Better' plays from the band. 
Meerkat Todd opens the lid of the dumpster and Olive, dressed in a glittery and slinky RED DRESS, with a BOA draped around her bare shoulder, pops up and croons with a handheld mic and slightly different lyrics: 
OLIVE Nobody does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest. Nobody does it half as good as me. Baby, I'm the best. 
Todd lifts Olive out of the dumpster and she sings her ass off - and she's quite good. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) I wasn't lookin,' But somehow they found me. I tried to hide from Your love light. But like heaven above me The guys who loved me Are keepin' all my secrets safe tonight. 
She winks at the audience. The guys begin to wolf whistle and howl at her sheer brilliance. 
She begins to rub her hands seductively over Meerkat Todd's furry costume, eventually unzipping it and taking off the head to reveal: 
BLUE DEVIL TODD! The crowd goes wild. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) And nobody does it better Though sometimes I wish someone could. Nobody does it quite the way I do. Why'd I have to be so good? 
She saunters over to Rhi and kisses her on the cheek, leaving a big, red lip mark. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) The way that they hold me Whenever they hold me There's some kind of magic inside you. That keeps me from runnin', But just keep it comin'! How'd you learn to do the things you do? 
She sees that Gibbons is not amused, but that doesn't stop her. 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Oh, and nobody does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest. (MORE) 
OLIVE (CONT'D) Nobody does it half as good as me. Baby, baby! Darlin', I'm the best! 
She walks over to a couple of HORN PLAYERS, and runs her fingers seductively over their (uh) instruments. 
The crowd goes wild - some appalled, but most enthused.

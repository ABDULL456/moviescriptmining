Still hear metal scraping against asphalt.. .then it stops. BOTTOM RIGHT CORNER OF FRAME, a wheelbarrow filled with 250 pounds of black asphalt edges into frame, followed by the guy sweating, struggling as he pushes it, GEORGE "MICKY" WARD JR., 31, short, compact, close-cropped reddish-blonde hair, little boy face, glancing over his shoulder, dumps the wheelbarrow on old cracked cement.. .picks up a scraping- spreading tool on a metal broom stick, and commences to spread out the new asphalt. Trying to complete a newly paved road to the right which ends in this intersection. The scraping tool spreading the new asphalt. Micky sweating, dirty from asphalt. Now skinny bare arms start shadowboxing around Micky working. Only the arms enter frame in combinations, shadow punches. 
MICKY (ignoring punches, keeps 
SPREADING ASPHALT) Will you help me finish this? He turns and kinda smiles as leans away with the rake, then slips and moves with the punches being thrown by RICHARD "Dicky" ECKLUND JR., 38, Micky's half-brother, skeleton-like arms, backwards baseball cap, shorts, work boots, enters frame, shadowboxing around Micky, smiles missing teeth. The two brothers play spar, joking, having fun. Micky throws a and Dicky play snaps his head back. Then Dicky does it to Micky. Then Micky throws an upper cut and Dicky pops his head up, broken toy robot.

SMASH CUT TO: 
MICKY 
(MID-INTERVIEW) Dicky's six years older than me. (pause) I used to carry his bags (pause) to his workouts, some of his fights. He's a born fighter, very natural talent. I always hadda work harder, and he's been my teacher. He's -- ya know - [real love] Dicky, nobody talks like him, moves like him, he fought Sugar Ray Leonard, ten rounds, he's the hero of Lowell. Everybody knows Dicky. 
HBO PRODUCER He's s'pposed to be trainin' you right now, right? Is he still coming or did we mix this up?

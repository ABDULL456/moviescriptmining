Petal naked in near-darkness, moves with authority toward the massive lumpy creature nearly overflowing his bed. Draws the covers back. 
Stares. 
PETAL Christ.   I won the lottery. 
Climbs on, the lithe move of a leopardess.         Feeding time. 
QUOYLE (V.O.) It was pretty much like that for a month. 
Petal RIDING in silhouette, with great, violent swoops.            CLOSE on his face, his eyes. Lovelight. 
QUOYLE (V.O.) Somewhere in there. We got married. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Horrible place. Smoke and bodies. Quoyle alone, carrying his sloshing beer, apologies unheard, toward... 
QUOYLE (V.O.) After that, I had to follow her to see her. 
...the back of Petal, talking to a big guy in a shiny suit. 
QUOYLE (V.O.) Which I know was wrong of me. 
Closer.   Close enough to hear... 
PETAL What do you think? You want to marry me, don't you? 
HOLD on Quoyle's face. The lovelight has never left.          It shines through the shock. As if in apology... 
QUOYLE (V.O.) She didn't know she was pregnant. 
DISSOLVE to... 
INT. PARLOR - DAY 
One-year-old BUNNY is SCREAMING in a rickety crib festooned with mobiles and bright toys. HEAR Quoyle POUNDING in. He reaches to lift her... 
...WAY UP, starts running around the faded little parlor making cheerful airplane noises, as he DIVES and SWOOPS the shrieking kid, until he... 
...stops. Sniffs. Oh. Gives her a kiss, which doesn't put a dent in the screaming, and flops her down on the diaper table. She is screaming LOUDER. He is fumbling with the diaper, the Baby Wipes, getting a wad of ten or so at once. When... 
...the phone rings. He runs off. Runs back, lifts Bunny, diaper dangling from the tape stuck to her skin, and SNATCHES up the phone, hoping with everything in him that it's... 
PETAL (O.S.) Hey. How do you make an Alabama Slammer? 
He takes a breath.     Can hear the noise of a rowdy spot.     Country juke box. 
QUOYLE Uh.    Where are y... 
PETAL (O.S.) Alabama.     Hence, the question. 
Bunny.   Has stopped screaming. 
QUOYLE Come home.     I'll make you one. 
PETAL (O.S.) That's a swell idea. Now go look on top of the fridge, where I keep the Mr. Boston. I'll wait. 
What should he do? He sets Bunny carefully on the floor. She starts screaming again, and he LIFTS her quick, cuddles her. LOPES off, leaving the phone on the floor... 
...RACES back in with the Mr. Boston, a bag of pork rinds, and a pacifier. Something for everyone. As he flips the pages, he murmurs into the phone... 
QUOYLE You okay?     Except for being thirsty? 
She laughs, almost friendly.      He smiles.   Ever hopeful. 
PETAL (O.S.) I'm busy, I'll see y... 
QUOYLE (reads) Ounce Southern Comfort, ounce Sloe Gin. Ounce Triple Sec. Three ounces o.j.... 
PETAL (O.S.) Got it. 
CLICK. The BUZZ of her disconnect. He glances down at Bunny, working the pacifier. Murmurs to the receiver... 
QUOYLE Me too.    I'll tell Bunny you miss her. 
Hang up the phone. Kiss a baby. Eat a pork rind. Slow. As he gazes down on Bunny, we PUSH INTO her face, and MATCH DISSOLVE to... 
INT. BUNNY'S ROOM - NIGHT, FIVE YEARS LATER 
...an ECU of Bunny, now six years old, asleep in the flickering blue light of a nearly-mute TV. Apparently she was watching Sportscenter. PAN the darkened shoebox room. Toys everywhere, in a clutter. A pile of used Barbies, limbs jutting in all directions, waiting for a mass grave. BACK to Bunny, to see... 
...she sleeps in her father's lap. His chin resting on her head, an industrial-size bag of cookies handy. Somewhere, a door OPENS.. 
...SLAMS HARD. Quoyle gently lays Bunny on her bed, and lurches INTO the hall, to see Petal disappearing into her bedroom, and he hurries to stop the door before it slams in his face. 
When she turns, she is wasted, feral, and somehow as sexy as ever. Her laser glare. What the fuck do you want? 
QUOYLE There's.    Cold chicken. 
Really? She tears off her jacket, revealing that she has left her shirt somewhere and is down to her bra. She stalks toward him. Straight to the doorway. He flinches. 
PETAL Find yourself. A girlfriend. With what you got down there, you'll do fine. 
Quoyle swallows.     Shakes his head. 
PETAL Only thing can work, here.    Is divorce. 
No.   No.   Tears of shock pool in his eyes. 
QUOYLE (V.O.) I knew we had our problems. But I never thought I'd hear that word. 
She shivers with disgust. Walks around in a frustrated circle. Back to his face. Are you sure? What does a girl have to do? And now... 
...the tears are on his face.     She flashes her hardest look.      And yet... 
A beat. 
QUOYLE Should I finish the sawmill piece? 
INT. QUOYLE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Quoyle enters carrying a spray of violets.     HEAR Springer turned up loud. He goes to the parlor to find... 
...MRS. MOOSUP, the babysitter, smoking and swigging a Pepsi. She is mean-ugly with flesh hanging beneath her arms. She stares at him, the flowers. 
MRS. MOOSUP (dry) Mr. Quoyle. You shouldn't have. 
QUOYLE (taking her literally) They're for Petal, Mrs. Moosup. I got something to tell her. 
MRS. MOOSUP Well, that may take awhile. 
Uh-oh. 
MRS. MOOSUP She came in at one, packed like crazy. Said she was movin' to Florida with the guy in the red Geo. You know the one. 
He knows the one. 
MRS. MOOSUP She says you gotta pay my wages for the sittin'. Seven weeks, comes to $3080. 'Preciate a check right n... 
He is heading toward the hall. 
MRS. MOOSUP Don't bother. She took Bunny with her. 
That stops him.    Cold.     He turns... 
QUOYLE That's the last thing she'd ev... 
MRS. MOOSUP She was real clear about my check. It's no fun workin' if you don't get paid. 
He TEARS out, DOWN the hall, INTO Bunny's room... 
...closet open. Empty. No more tangled pile of Barbies.                He surveys the wreckage of his life. 
QUOYLE (V.O.) At least she took her toys.       Wanted her to be happy. 
He staggers out of the room, down the hall... 
MRS. MOOSUP (O.S.) Mr. Quoyle? I ain't got all day, here! 
...into the kitchen.       Lifts the receiver.    Thinks.     Dials. 
QUOYLE (quietly) Yes.     I need to report a kidnapping. 
And straightens his spine.       Just a little. 
QUOYLE Quoyle. Q-U-O-Y-L-...no, Y, then L-E. Yeh, it's my kid. 
He's still holding the violets.         He notices this.     Sets them down, almost tenderly, in the sink. 
INT. QUOYLE'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT 
Quoyle alone in absolute darkness. Bumping around the house. There's a large bag of something in one hand, maybe M & Ms. But he's not eating. Just murmuring to himself... 
QUOYLE 
Who knows?     Who knows? 
INT. QUOYLE'S PARENTS' HOME, BROOKLYN - DAY 
Quoyle moving in his parents' cluttered parlor like a man underwater. A room as drab, as neglected, as Brooklyn through the window. He stands at a shelf now, staring at a row of framed photos. Lifts one... 
...a BOY of 15, bundled for winter, stands by a frozen pond. Stocky, sullen, something unpleasant in the narrow eyes. Next to him, not touching, a GIRL, big for 12. Rawboned, husky. Flat gaze, like something's dead or hidden. 
Quoyle walks to the table. A cardboard box has been filled with mementos. A slip of paper: AGNIS HAMM, a telephone number. The phone is RINGING now. Quoyle staring at the paper. Finally, lifts the phone, breathes an absent greeting, and... 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) Is this Mr. Guy Quoyle? 
QUOYLE (weary) He's not here. 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) This is Lt. Amos Figg of the Mockingburg, New York Police. Could you have him call me when he ret... 
QUOYLE He's passed on. He's dead. (beat) You said Mockingb... 
FIGG (O.S.) We're a small town upstate. I'm actually trying to reach his son. He allegedly went down to his parents' place two days ago. 
Quoyle blinks.   Not in the mood. 
QUOYLE Are you a detective, Lieutenant? 
FIGG (O.S.) Yes sir. 
QUOYLE Well, as you've probably deduced, I am his son. Cause I'm at his place. As alleged. 
Silence. 
FIGG (O.S.) 
There's no need for that tone, sir. I'm calling with urgent news. 
And says no more.     We can feel Quoyle's heart beating from here. 
QUOYLE Which is...? 
FIGG (O.S., hesitant) You want the good news? Or the bad news. 
Ominous.   Would be an understatement. 
QUOYLE The good.     Please. 
FIGG (O.S.) Your daughter Bunny was sold by your wife to a child pornographer. For $9000. 
Tall and rawboned and 60. A rugged, maybe even handsome face, set with ice-blue eyes. Calm, slightly scary eyes, that drift to his robe... 
AGNIS You sick?     It's nine o'clock. 
He is completely off-balance here. 
QUOYLE Uh. No, Bunny and I like to... uh, early to bed, earl... 
AGNIS Losin' your wife, your folks, and your job'd depress anybody. It's a wonder you don't sleep all day. 
Not that she seems to approve. Not at all. His eyes now drift to the large, well-used SUITCASES dangling from her powerful hands. 
AGNIS Thought I'd stay a day or two. Give you some relief with th... 
And stops.   The mouth doesn't smile.     But the eyes crinkle slightly toward... 
...Bunny. Who has crept out in her jammies.         Hugging a sack of Pepperidge Farm cookies like it was a teddy. 
AGNIS (to Bunny) You like blue dogs named Warren? 
The little girl nods.     As if she certainly does. 
AGNIS I got one in the car. 
INT. PARLOR - LATER 
In the far corner of the room, Bunny plays with WARREN, a sweet, ugly dog. Toothless and, undeniably, blue. 
QUOYLE (O.S.) I never knew her, really. 
See him now, sipping his tea.     Wallowing in the detritus of his emotions. 
QUOYLE But she was driven by terrible forces, no one could understand. She was a locked door. Even to me. 
Agnis in the good chair. Teacup on her ample lap. Assessing a photo on the end table, Petal's arctic eyes, rigidly seductive pose. The snapshot enshrined by a neighboring votive rose in its jelly jar glass. 
AGNIS So she wasn't just a bitch in high heels? 
Quoyle's eyes cut instinctively toward his daughter, her innocence protected by distance and absorption with Warren's passivity. 
AGNIS Don't stress. She mighta heard worse from her momma. I'm only guessin'. 
QUOYLE Some people probably thought Petal was bad clear through. 
AGNIS People.     Are a cynical lot. 
QUOYLE I think she just couldn't get enough love. 
Agnis' unblinking eyes. 
AGNIS I think the evidence.     Is on your side. 
The eyes study him.     Dissect him, even. 
AGNIS I'm headed north, Nephew, to where our family comes from, in Newfoundland. Thought I'd never go back. But the older y'get... 
Clucks her tongue. 
AGNIS There's a pull. Becomes an ache. As if where your people started held a purpose for you. Like you're a piece in a puzzle... 
Not a smile. But something.        A softening of timbre, a flicker behind the eye. 
AGNIS ...lookin' for where y'fit. 
Lifts her cup. 
AGNIS You, too. 
Takes a sip.     His eyes have narrowed in a burlesque of suspicion. 
QUOYLE In what sense do you m... 
AGNIS You need to come, Nephew. 
Just like that. 
AGNIS Nothin' here but hurt. You got to start fresh, everythin's gone! 
Hmmn? 
AGNIS The trip'll clear your head. Be educational for the squirt. Teach ya the world's still spinnin' outside this toxic slice o'Hades. And who knows...? 
Tilts her head.     Who knows. 
AGNIS They must have a newspaper up there. Somebody's gotta write it. 
He just stares.     The blankest of the blank. 
AGNIS Tell the truth, I'd appreciate the company. You two are pretty much my family. 
His face softens.       Hadn't thought of it that way.      And seeing this... 
AGNIS A pot o'coffee would hit the spot. Drop o'whiskey would fit nice in it. 
She waits.   He rises.      And when he does... 
AGNIS Which one's my brother? 
He blinks.   She looks at two URNS on the mantle. 
QUOYLE Uh.     There's Mom.   And that's Poppa. 
The name of the funeral home tastefully stenciled.           He clears his throat... 
QUOYLE Those are temporary. 
Apparently a private one, too.     Keeps walking. 
INT. GREEN HOUSE - TWILIGHT 
Inside the dank, corroding place. We can feel all 44 years of abandonment. CRASH! The door FLIES open. Quoyle with his tire iron steps aside, and... 
...Agnis drags Bunny inside. The wind shrieking low through openings like proper spirits. Even this bold child is frightened. So Agnis leans to murmur... 
AGNIS Up those stairs, Aunt Pinkie slept. So fat she couldn't get down to her chamber pot. Wanna see if she's still there? 
Asked as a serious question.     Bunny nods.   Let's. 
ANGLE...upstairs now. Agnis marching through like MacArthur reclaiming the Philippines. Room after rough-hewn spacious room, light spiking through a thousand roof holes in assorted shapes. 
AGNIS Well. Too late to drive that road back 'round the bay. We'll camp in here tonight. Be right as rain. 
Quoyle looks down to his daughter.     Who nods, as if that were a perfectly natural suggestion. 
BUNNY Which one's Petal's room?   I'll sleep there. 
INT. GREEN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT 
CLOSE on Bunny's sleeping face.     PUSH INTO her closed eyes, and FADE to... 
...a WINDOW, unearthly tendrils of FOG drifting past in moonglow wisps. Suddenly, a FACE appears, an animal. White. Wolf, or more likely, dog. It stares in at us, is fleetingly joined by a grizzled HUMAN ghost, eyes FLASHING crazy, and... 
...gone in mist.     CUT to... 
REAR ANGLE of Quoyle and Bunny, each rolled over onto one side, asleep in their sleeping bags. His arm across her protectively. Hers across Warren, who sleeps curled to her chest. PAN up to... 
...the window.     Only the shimmer of cloud-like mist.     SNAP to... 
REVERSE ANGLE...Bunny's eyes.     wide open. 
INT. ROOM - DAWN 
CLOSE on Quoyle, stirring at the end of sleep.        His eyes flutter open. A beat. He is alone. sits... 
...BOLT UPRIGHT. 
ANGLE...front hallway, Quoyle's bulk POUNDING toward us, boots in his hand. The front door ajar. And at the threshold, in a decorous semi-circle, six naked Barbies. Legs spread wide for balance. Each staring out the doorway, to where... 
...Bunny sits on the cold ground. Making some craft project with great care. Quoyle can breathe again, she's safe. Ambles out, crouches beside her. Close. 
She keeps working. Almost eerie concentration. He sees now that she is weaving a loop of dandelion stems, connected by aluminum pop tops. He leans down. Kisses her head. 
QUOYLE Is that a belt or a crown? 
No answer. That concerns him. The intensity of her focus. He notices now, the soda and beer cans with their tops popped. Lined up in a row. He lifts one, liquid sloshes out. They're full. 
QUOYLE Sodas get flat withou... 
BUNNY This is important. 
She won't look up.     He glances back to the doorway. 
QUOYLE That why the Barbies are watching? 
BUNNY They're being nice and patient. 
QUOYLE They must be chilly, tho.     Should I get their clo... 
BUNNY They look better this way.        They have great bodies. 
He looks back. Well. Maybe so. Holds up one of the heavy boots he's carrying. It has a thick blue shoelace. The other. Has none. Sticks that one in front of her face. 
She looks up to him.     Tugs on the shoelace, which she now wears as a necklace... 
BUNNY I need it.     I look good in blue. 
QUOYLE (smiles) Well.     I look good in shoes. 
...sees now what she has tugged from inside her shirt.     The shoelace necklace holds a dull metal KEY as a pendant.     He blinks. 
QUOYLE I was lookin' for that all over our old place. The landlady s... 
BUNNY I need it. 
He takes that in.    The urgency of it.   She is staring in his eyes. So he grins... 
QUOYLE You had quite the heavy morning. Take the rest of the day off. 
She doesn't smile back. Returns to her work. He looks out by the cliff, to see Agnis staring across the bay, Warren sitting at her side. He pulls on his boots. Gets to his feet. 
QUOYLE Be right back, and we'll start talking breakf... 
BUNNY (not looking up) Watch out for the dog. 
He looks across the ground toward old Warren. 
QUOYLE Yeh, her farts are pretty scary. 
BUNNY I mean.     The white one! 
Now their eyes meet.    Matter-of-fact... 
BUNNY The White Dog with the big teeth and the red eyes. The Skinny Ghost owns him. They came last night. 
He draws a breath... 
BUNNY I didn't dream 'em, don't say I did. 
He thinks this over. 
QUOYLE I was gonna say.     I'll keep my eyes peeled. 
Drunken, devilish smile.     Quoyle turns, innocent questioning eyes. You got a boat? 
NUTBEEM I built a Chinese junk. Sailed it up from Brazil. Missed Manhattan by a mile or so, got stranded here when I shipwrecked by Gaze Island. 
So casual and falsely modest, Quoyle's eyes are big. 
NUTBEEM Almost finished my repairs. Be leaving soon. As paleontologists define the term. 
Studies Quoyle's amazement.     Confides... 
NUTBEEM She's ugly. And the only thing I've ever loved. 
Dennis rises.   Belches. 
DENNIS Yer story tugs at me bladder. 
And off he lurches to correct the situation.       Once he's gone... 
QUOYLE Him and Jack. Tell it. 
Their eyes meet.     The Brit sighs. 
NUTBEEM Jack Buggit's psychic, start with that. He's got the gift. Specially about the sea. 
Thinking. Should he tell it?      Quoyle makes a rolling hand motion, hurry it up. 
NUTBEEM Older brother Jesson, everyone's favorite, even Dennis'. Goes to sea like his dad. One day, rest of the family's sitting by the radio, and Jack goes white... 
That's right. 
NUTBEEM Stands up. Says, Jesson's gone. Walks out of the house. Grief too big for walls to hold it. 
Sets down the burger.     Runs a finger down the frost on his beer mug. 
NUTBEEM So Dennis is forbidden the sea. But being free, Newfie, and 21, he goes anyway. 
QUOYLE And that's enough t...? 
NUTBEEM Death storm. Monster wave cracks her steel hull amidships, one inch crack from starboard to port. Men go in the water. Dennis lost. After a week... 
A week. 
NUTBEEM They come to Jack, call off the search. He stands like a stone. Then turns, sharp, the way he does. Says only, 'He's alive. And I know where.' 
QUOYLE Man's a witch. 
NUTBEEM Went to sea, alone, in just a skiff. Finds him. Can you guess the odds? Finds him. Finds him. Both arms broke, 99% dead. 
Leans.    Close. 
NUTBEEM Boy comes to. Jack says if you ever 
step in a boat again, I'll drown ya m'self. And you know what the kid said...? 
Quoyle glances over.      Dennis wobbling his way back through the tables. 
QUOYLE Say it fast. 
NUTBEEM Says fishin' licenses are all spoken for, I'd appreciate you givin' me yours. Jack looked in his eyes. They never spoke ag... 
DENNIS What's bein' blabbed here? 
NUTBEEM (not missing a beat) Quoyle says you got a nice ass. 
DENNIS Quoyle's right. 
He raises his beer. 
DENNIS To my ass. 
QUOYLE I'll drink to that. 
And, by God.   They do. 
EXT. WAVEY'S YARD - AFTERNOON 
Quoyle and Bunny climb out of the wagon. A small house, its grassy yard strewn with a phantasmagoria of painted wood figures, galloping horses, dogs balanced on wheels, a row of chrome hubcaps on sticks. A zoo of the mind. To one side, a table piled with crafts, ignored by... 
...fifteen LITTLE KIDS running in all directions, like bundled, unbridled banshees. Looks like fun. Two harried MOTHERS are trying to cope with the chaos. And there, under a tree... 
...the honey-haired WOMAN Quoyle had seen on the ferry. And in the rain. She is on her knees, tying the shoes of her vacant-faced SON. He trips and sprawls, but he is laughing. The woman smiles tenderly and tousles his brown-straw hair. 
Quoyle gets up his courage. Walks Bunny over to them.       As we arrive, the woman looks up... 
QUOYLE (really nervous) Hullo.     It's our first day, and I 
was wond... 
BUNNY What's wrong with him? 
Quoyle freezes.    She means, of course, the blankly-staring boy. 
QUOYLE Hey, how 'bout we ask what's wrong with you? There's nothing wr... 
WOMAN (to Bunny, softly) Sure, there is. This is Herry, and he has Down's Syndrome. It means he learns things very slowly. 
Oh.   HERRY smiles at Bunny.      Suddenly, wonderfully. 
BUNNY (to Herry) Know how to be a dog? 
She DROPS to all fours and starts YAPPING like a terrier. Herry LAUGHS with delight. Tumbles down to the grass and does his impression of a Chihuahua on speed. 
BUNNY (to the woman) He looks fast to me. Maybe he's cured. 
WOMAN Maybe. 
She turns to Quoyle.       Who just gapes at her.   Open-mouthed. 
QUOYLE (softly) Oh.   My.    God. 
INT. GREEN HOUSE - DAY 
Quoyle enters, impressed by the progress of the renovation. Windows are in, walls patched, floor sanded, lights are working. 
Through the place into... 
...the kitchen, which is in surprisingly usable shape. Agnis sits alone at a butcher block table with a set of ledgers spread before her. A large mug of tea. A bottle of Bushmill's Irish. 
QUOYLE You are a woman of mystery, Aunt. Mystery and surprise. 
AGNIS (still working) Silver Melville says you was out there. Be nice in yer story, she's payin' for a piece of this house. 
Silence. 
QUOYLE You said upholstery.   Never said yacht uphol... 
AGNIS ...never said not. Ask better questions, you got a chance fer better answers. Got my shop set up in Killick-Claw, now. 
Looks up.    Sees he's dazzled by how she moves right along. 
AGNIS Two good workers. Mrs. Mavis Bangs is an old plow horse like m'self. But Dawn... 
She winks. 
AGNIS Dawn's young and on the sexy side. You oughta drop by and say hullo. 
He absorbs that.     How fast can he change the subject? 
QUOYLE Where's Bunny? 
Agnis looks at him.     Reaches for the Bushmill's. 
AGNIS Upstairs, in what will soon become her room. She'll be all right. 
QUOYLE What does that mean? 
She pours some whiskey into her tea cup. 
QUOYLE Little early in the day f... 
AGNIS Warren died today.    That's what that means. 
Drinks the whiskey.    Stares straight in his eyes.     Sees his sorrow. The honesty in... 
QUOYLE Poor old girl. 
Agnis deciding.    Whether to tell him... 
AGNIS I used to live with someone named Warren. Died of cancer, after nine years together. Dearest soul on this earth. 
Quoyle shocked. What can he say? His empathy so naked, so real, even Agnis has to soften her voice... 
AGNIS Went from the funeral, and bought that dog. Named her Warren. Just so I could say the name a hunnerd times a day. Women are foolish, huh? 
QUOYLE I never thought so. 
A good moment for them.    It holds a beat. 
AGNIS Bunny wants to bury the dog with me. But I told her I'd rather do it alone. 
Quoyle nods.   Rises slowly.   He'd better go to her. 
AGNIS Some advice about the child? 
Another sip. 
AGNIS Don't get down on her level, the way you do. She'll never respect you. 
INT. BUNNY'S ROOM - DAY 
Bunny sits on the floor in dim light, wearing an enormous blue sweatshirt. Obviously dad's. Her naked Barbies sit in a semi- circle watching her braid a meticulous loop out of the paper and foil from chewing gum wrappers. Quoyle enters, and sits close beside her. Watches in silence, as she works. 
BUNNY (not looking up) Warren died today. She's not coming back. 
No tears.   Just a hollow sound in her voice. 
BUNNY That's the difference. 
He knows what she means.      Strokes her hair. 
QUOYLE Another necklace, huh?    Can I help? 
BUNNY You can watch. 
Okay.   He looks at the Barbies. 
QUOYLE Do I have to take my clothes off? 
She looks up at him.     Straight to his eyes. 
BUNNY You look better with 'em on. 
Goes back to work.     He watches her. 
QUOYLE You know.    You do look good in blue. 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
Quoyle driving the wagon, Dennis at his side. Up ahead on the road, two figures. Herry holds tight to his mom's hand. Quoyle pulls over, and they stop. Wavey squints at him, against the sun. 
QUOYLE Give you folks a lift? 
BUNNY First is the teaching part.     The learning comes later. 
Herry nods.   Later.   And out of the blue... 
BUNNY Wavey? Now are the berries ready to pick? 
Quoyle looks over to the woman. But instead of Wavey, he sees PETAL, staring at him with slow predatory heat. 
PETAL Want to pick my berries, do you. Should I climb right up on this sink? 
And then, once more she is... 
WAVEY Almost. Almost ready.       You know, it's all about timing. 
Quoyle.   Takes note. 
INT. GAMMY BIRD - DAY 
Quoyle alone in the office, pretending to peck away at a story. Actually, he's looking... 
...through the window. Where Jack Buggit, Tert Card, Billy Pretty and Nutbeem are all circling around a small, roughly-made boat, attached to its rented trailer. They are talking to each other in learned tones. A Talmudic chat. And... 
...in they come.     First through the door... 
CARD That's yer boat. 
QUOYLE Said it was. 
CARD One question remains.     Why. Is that. Yer boat? 
Uh-oh. He looks from one face to another. Even Billy is irritated. Nutbeem gazes down, embarrassed for him. 
QUOYLE Well.   A boat's a boa... 
CARD It's a shit boat. Best thing, get rid of it some dark night. 
Quoyle can't believe this.      Hot shame burns. 
BILLY Go hire Alvin Yark to build ya a sweet little rodney. This thing's a wallowing cockeyed bastard that'll sink in a bathtub. 
And standing in the doorway, the scariest sight of all.    The boss. Just shaking his head. 
JACK (sadly) 
You don't have the sense God gave a doughnut, do ya? 
The word from Sinai on Quoyle's worth.       A pity. 
JACK I'm goin' fishin'. 
Out the door with a SLAMM!      Quoyle stares hopelessly after him. 
NUTBEEM Don't jump off a bridge over it. Anyone can make a brainless, asinine, devastatingly revealing blunder. 
QUOYLE (actually means this) Thanks. 
CARD What in th' furry pit of Newfie hell. Is this!? 
Holds up some sheets of paper.       Photos of the Melvilles' botterjacht. Reads... 
CARD Hitler's Barge...? 
QUOYLE That goes with the shipping news. Profile of a vessel in port. 
CARD What about the car accident? 
QUOYLE That's the one I didn't do. Mrs. Diddolate sprained her wrist. Period. 
Card still reading. 
CARD So you didn't do the one Jack told yer to do, and you did one he don't know yer did! 
Silence. 
QUOYLE Pretty mu... 
CARD This copy.     Is worse.   Than yer boat. 
He looks up.   Equal parts disgust and delight. 
CARD 
Jack even sniffs this, he cuts you up fer lobster bait. I've half a mind to run it. 
Quoyle straightens his spine. 
QUOYLE Run it. 
Strides off for the door.     Turns back... 
QUOYLE As for the part about you havin' half a mind? No comment. 
Out the door.   SLAMM harder than Jack's. 
EXT. GAMMY BIRD - DAY 
Quoyle stumbling toward his wagon with vacant eyes. 
QUOYLE (V.O.) Headline. Reporter Disembowels Self With Rusty Joke. 
EXT. GREEN HOUSE ROOF - DAY 
Quoyle in a carpenter's belt, climbing very carefully from a ladder onto the roof. His vertigo apparent as he keeps to his hands and knees, trying to fight the compulsion to look down. Gives in to it, peering from the corner of his eye down the cliff, the rocks, the sea so far below. Not a good 1dea. 
Comes to the shingles. Eases his way into a fearful crouch.   Okay. Starts hammering. And rehearsing. 
AGNIS And this is Dawn Budgel.   She's a vegetarian. 
Dawn, once described by Agnis as young and on the sexy side, is that. Red lipstick and nails. Her eyes float up in a way that suggests reflexive sensuality. Agnis nods to her, and the girl reaches a slender pale hand... 
DAWN Agnis is always saying such...things about you. It's nice to fit a man. 
With the name. 
And as she releases his hand, her eyes flick to Agnis. Some conspiracy there. Quoyle follows his aunt back to the big cutting table. 
QUOYLE I just, uh, came to see if you'd heard abou.. 
AGNIS Silver Melville?    Snuck off in the night, they did.    Not a penny paid for all we done. 
Shows him sheets of baby blue leather. 
AGNIS We'd installed the banquettes in her salon. Three of the chairs done and delivered, three to go... 
Points to them.    A neat row by the makeshift kitchenette. 
QUOYLE That's.    That's just terrible. 
But Agnis is thinking... 
AGNIS Strange.    Leavin' the chairs. 
And as he glances off, he sees Dawn across the way.      Her skirt hiked up, as if she were adjusting a stocking. 
She isn't wearing any. 
EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY 
Billowy clouds frame a languid KITE, silver and sleek, darting this way and that. Graceful, in command of the currents. 
WAVEY (O.S.) HERRY PROWSE! LOOK HOW WELL YOUR KITE IS DOING! 
See her now, seated atop a grassy slope. It is she who holds the string, and her boy is way down at the bottom of the hill with Bunny. Blue jumper billowing, the girl is teaching him how to make necklaces from wildflowers and garbage bag twisty-ties. Herry and the naked Barbies watch with great attention. The learning will come later. 
WAVEY ARE YOU MAKING IT DANCE WITH YOUR THOUGHTS? 
On this he looks up.     Serious. 
WAVEY KEEP THINKING YOUR THOUGHTS! YOUR KITE IS DOING SO MUCH BETTER THAN MR. QUOYLE'S! 
PULL BACK slightly to reveal that Quoyle has been sitting right beside her all along. He holds the string of a big, glum kite that hangs motionless in space with barely a flutter. As she watches the kids, he stares at her, fixedly deciding whether to ask... 
QUOYLE (barely audible) Do you think Bunny's. Strange? 
Wavey looks over.     Sees that he's worried half to death. 
QUOYLE In New York. They said she had a... personality disorder. 
WAVEY (softly) And it was named Petal. 
Do you understand that? 
QUOYLE All these hallucin... 
WAVEY The White Dog. Sometimes with the Skinny Ghost. Kids do things like that, it's called imagination. Like the necklaces. 
The necklaces, yeh.     A thought that frightens him. 
QUOYLE You know how many she makes? 
She does. 
WAVEY It's a skill, she's proud of it. And she brings her dolls along. And she looks good in blue. And she wears a key for a good luck charm. 
Her kind smile.     No big deal. 
QUOYLE And she's saving her mother a room. Did she tell you that? 
Wavey's slow nod. 
QUOYLE 
She talks to her at night.        I can hear through the door. 
Very quiet now.    The wind.     The kites. 
QUOYLE You know how kids think.       You have all those books. 
WAVEY The ones I read to teach Herry. They don't make me an exp... 
QUOYLE (blurting) Just.     Is she okay? 
That was naked.    He swallows. 
QUOYLE I mean.     If you had to guess.. 
Too serious a subject.       Too good a woman.     For an easy lie. 
WAVEY That child is the only friend my son ever had. So she's strange, you bet. 
She swallows, too.    Her eyes are damp. 
WAVEY I love that little girl. And I will see to it. That she's all right. 
Hold the look. 
WAVEY And I don't have to guess about it. 
EXT. WOODS - LATER 
Quoyle RUNNING, huffing, through a bog with every color of berries imaginable. Around another bend in the path. Stops. Hands on his knees. 
A hush.    A frozen tableau in this room. 
QUOYLE Run it.   Like I wrote it. 
CARD How does this suit yer, Quoyle? I'll do my job. You do yers, which means a four-vehicle pile-up south a Killick-Claw. And don't ferget the camera. 
He slides the battered camera across the desk. They glare at each other a full beat. Card belches, softly. Quoyle takes the camera, heads for the door... 
CARD I fergot somethin'. 
Quoyle turns.    Card doesn't. 
CARD You pinko Greepeace sack a quivering pigfat. 
Thinks. 
CARD Did I leave out moosebutt-ugly? (nods to himself) You may go. 
HOLD on him.    Making a neat little pile of the torn pieces. 
QUOYLE (O.S.) Like I wrote it. 
SLAMM! Across the room, Nutbeem stands.        Takes his cigarettes. Passing Card's desk, on the way out... 
NUTBEEM Tough love. Impressive. 
SLAMM!    Card shoots Billy a challenging look.     You got something to say? 
BILLY I hope you get him fired. 
Do you. 
BILLY So I can watch him beat yer to jelly. 
Just turns around.     Flicks ON his computer.   Back to work. 
EXT. GREEN HOUSE - TWILIGHT 
Bunny jumping out of the wagon, running to the house.      As Quoyle locks his car... 
BUNNY (O.S.) Why'd you leave the house open? 
He looks up.   She is pushing the front door with one finger.     It swings OPEN. 
BUNNY Can I keep the necklace? 
...and lifts a long piece of TWINE. There are KNOTS neatly tied along its length. Quoyle stares. Stares. 
QUOYLE (calm) Sweetie.     Come sit in the car. 
INT. FRONT HALLWAY - TWILIGHT 
Quoyle climbing the stairs in fading light. He carries a tire iron. Stops midway. Listens to the silence. 
QUOYLE IF ANYBODY'S THERE, YOU BETTER COME OUT NOW! 
Up, up, to the top.     Looking down the empty hall to see... 
...knotted twine.     At every door. 
INT. GAMMY BIRD - EARLY MORNING 
Quoyle enters, haggard and distracted. The place is lit, but empty. A toilet FLUSHES. From the loo, appears... 
CARD S'tell me.     Yer fancy it? 
Nodding toward something behind Quoyle. Turning, we see that hanging over Card's desk is an oversized framed photo of: QUIET EYE - WORLD'S LARGEST OIL TANKER. Quoyle stares blankly. 
QUOYLE 
Like I said.    Nobody hangs those. 
Card just goes to the fresh stack of newspapers on his desk.       Hands one toward Quoyle... 
CARD Yer column's front page stuff. Only now, it's more like a caption, is all. 
A photo of the same tanker.       That hangs on Card's wall. 
QUOYLE (reads) More than 3000 tankers proudly ride the world's seas. Even the biggest take advantage of Newfoundland's deep- water ports and refineries. 
CARD Spelled everthin' perfect.     So as not t'embarrass yer. 
QUOYLE (reading) Oil and Newfoundland go together like ham and eggs, and like ham and eggs they'll nourish us in the coming years. 
CARD Even put yer name on it. 
QUOYLE (finishes reading) Let's all hang a picture of an oil tanker. On our wall. 
Stares at the paper.     In his hand. 
CARD Man a yer principles. I unnerstan' resignation is th'only honorable course. 
Quoyle looks up.     Card flinches back.    But all that comes is... 
QUOYLE How can a man resign.    To nobody? 
Drops the paper on the floor.       Steps on it, on his way toward the door. 
CARD If yer off to see Jack Buggit, yer'll hafta swim some. 
Quoyle turns back. 
CARD Yer can whine an' beg t'him.     But I 
runs his paper, every inch of it, every dirty time-eatin' job which he would have t'do without me. 
INTERCUT...a winch pulling part of the Geo, streaming mud, from swiftly flowing water. Police and bystanders gathered. 
QUOYLE (V.O.) And I wondered. Am I going where she's gone? 
BACK to the bay. A barely-conscious Quoyle still clings somehow to the plastic cooler. But hours have passed. Light is fading. 
QUOYLE (V.O.) ...and will I see her? 
He turns. And there she is. Beaming at him from the bow of her little rowboat, a smile ambiguous in the growing dusk. It could be love. From behind her a light GLOWS, giving Petal the aspect of an angel. 
She drops a wink.   FADES away.    And the light becomes... 
...the BEAM from a fishing boat. Quoyle squints his swollen eyes, as strong hands WRENCH him from his box. From the sea. A voice warbles, distorted by wind and Quoyle's diminished consciousness... 
JACK Jesus Cockadoodle Christ!     I knowed somebody was out here. 
Quoyle's teeth are chattering so hard, his body shivering so 
painfully, Buggit hauls him over the rail and lays him down on a wriggling mound of fish. 
JACK Thank god fer yer figure, me old son. A thin man woulda froze. 
Quoyle burrows into the fish, like nestling in a down comforter. Jack covers him with a heavy tarp. Crouches down close... 
JACK Good.   Yer lost th'boat. 
INT. BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Dim light. Quoyle stirs beneath the billowing down coverlet.   His eyes flutter. Open. Where...? 
VOICE (O.S., very soft) It's all right. You're in heaven. 
His head SNAPS around. She's sitting just beside the bed in half- shadow. Her oxblood knitting across her lap. 
WAVEY Actually.    It's just my bed. 
Now he sees the cigarette. 
WAVEY Actually, it's not. I just wanted to see your eyes bug out like that. 
Now he sees the smile. 
QUOYLE You don't smoke. 
His voice was a croak. So he CLEARS his throat with a massive and disgusting effort. It is gross and funny, and she smiles again. 
WAVEY Only when I'm worried.      I don't worry much. 
He rolls over, to see her better.      They are very close. 
QUOYLE You don't have to, I'm all right. I'm in heaven. 
WAVEY I'm not worried.    About you. 
Oh.   As he draws a breath to ask... 
WAVEY 
You're in the boys' room at Jack's house. Wonder how long since Dennis slept here. 
She glances to the nightstand. Beneath the dim lamp.       A picture of Jack and blond son Jesson. Guess what they're doing. 
WAVEY Mrs. Buggit called, knew Bunny was still with me. The kids are camped out in the parlor. 
A beat. 
QUOYLE Nice.   You sittin' up with me. 
A longer one. 
WAVEY S'okay. Someday you'll do somethin' nice for me. 
He nods.   He will. 
QUOYLE Who you worried ab... 
WAVEY You didn't find a second dead man. Just the rest of the first one. 
Ah.   He nods.   Well, that figures. 
QUOYLE I asked.   Who you worried about? 
On this, she stubs out her cigarette.      Takes another from the pack. 
WAVEY You said Bunny talks to Petal at night. You ever listen? 
He shakes his head. 
QUOYLE Not really. Wouldn't be right. 
WAVEY Well, I'm not that nice a person. 
STRIKES a match. 
WAVEY She plays Petal. Talks to the Barbies, like Petal talking to her. 
Brings her cigarette.   To the flame. 
WAVEY She says she's sorry she left them. It was just to see if they could be good girls. And they were... 
And. 
WAVEY ...and she loves them. 
His eyes at once rapt and suffering.     She watches that. 
Bunny looks down.    Glaring an evil spell of death at her own kneecaps. 
WAVEY (quietly) I think Bunny and I. Should take a walk. 
And stands. 
QUOYLE Uh. Wavey? If it's all the same to you... 
EXT. PATH - DAY 
Quoyle and Bunny alone, hand-in-hand, walking slow where they once picked berries. Nobody's talking. 
BUNNY When you gonna ask? 
QUOYLE (calm) When you're in the mood. 
Apparently, that hasn't happened yet.      More walking. 
QUOYLE She musta done something.     Really bad. 
Said like he means it.    Which he does.     And Bunny, squinting up, sees that. 
INTERCUT...the crime. Playground filled with kids. Bunny and girlfriends on the jungle gym. Bunny the best, a natural jock. MRS. LUMBULL large, sour, doughy, and betrayed by life, stands with her silver whistle in the midst of chaos. Her thoughts on a higher 
plane. 
BUNNY (O.S.) She's the worst one of all! 
Little Herry Prowse comes to tug at the teacher's wool coat. He is holding his crotch and jumping up and down. This does not require an advanced credential to interpret. 
BUNNY (O.S.) Herry told her he had to pee. But the way he talks. He could just say 'eeee,' like that. 
Mrs. Lumbull looks down. From her face as she responds, she has already devoted, over time, more professional attention to this troublemaker than should be asked of any dedicated educator. 
BUNNY (O.S.) She told him that recess was almost over, an' she wasn't gonna make a trip special, an' he could hold it. 
Herry, seemingly, disagrees. Still holding his crotch, he jumps up and down with greater agitation. She grabs him, rather roughly, by the arm. Marches him over to... 
BUNNY (O.S.) She made him stand against the wall. 
...and walks off, pointedly ignoring him from ten feet away. He screams, pumping his fists in frustration. Grabs himself, suddenly. Whether or not we can see the dampness spread, we can see his humiliation all too clearly. As his tears come... 
...a figure BOLTS into frame from behind Mrs. Lumbull. Hunched over like a linebacker, full speed ahead, LAUNCHING herself into the back of the large woman's knees. Her feet go UP, and the rest of her goes... 
...DOWN like the proverbial amount of bricks. Herry's tears stop fast. Watching the woman shriek, and keep shrieking. Makes him laugh. CUT... 
BACK TO...the berry path.   They are sitting on a fallen log. 
QUOYLE See, a good dad would say hitting is always wrong. You coulda hurt her bad. I guess you know that. 
BUNNY She wasn't hurt for real.     Just screamed like a baby. 
Quoyle pulls out a single Snickers bar. 
QUOYLE Wish I'd seen it.     It really sounds funny. 
BUNNY Petal'll think so, too. 
He looks at her.      Nods, probably will.    Peels the candy bar free of its wrapper. 
QUOYLE Well, there won't be any trouble at school. I'II take care of that. 
BUNNY How? 
He breaks the candy bar in half.        Tho not quite equally. 
QUOYLE Because the best thing about people. Is they can forgive each other. I heard that this morning. 
BUNNY That teacher. Is gonna forgive me? 
He nods.   Oh, yeh. 
QUOYLE That. And she won't want the story printed in the paper. 
Oh. 
BUNNY Well.   I don't wanna forgive her. 
QUOYLE Me neither. 
He holds out the two pieces of candy. She takes them both.         the bigger one in his mouth. As he chews... 
BUNNY I had to do it. 'Cept for Wavey, I'm the only family Herry's got. 
She nibbles at her own piece. 
BUNNY Like the ghost.     Who's not a ghost. 
Hmmn? 
BUNNY The one who ties the knots?     You're 
the only family he's got. 
Right?   Her father doesn't react.       He's even stopped chewing. 
BUNNY You said. 
And slowly.    Quoyle nods.    I said. 
EXT. NOLAN'S SHED - DAY 
Quoyle picks his way down to the battered boat shed, hidden at the foot of his cliff. He carries a big carton, which we see has made the journey slow and awkward. Across the gravel now, to... 
...the door. HEAR the fire crackling, see the smoke curling. Takes a breath. Knocks softly. Then LOUDER. 
QUOYLE (really casual) Macau, huh? So. That where y'sent th' chairs? 
Agnis turns.   Sizes him up. 
AGNIS It's flatterin' you showin' me how you've turned into such a competent reporter and all. But even if I remembered where I sent 'em. I couldn't tell ya. 
Puts her fingers to her lips.      Leans closer, to confide something he is obviously unaware of... 
AGNIS Professional ethics. 
INT. WAVEY'S KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT 
CLOSE on Wavey, cooking flapjacks.      Talking to them. 
WAVEY Only you.     Could do this. 
And she's not pleased. 
WAVEY You fed him. You gave him clothes. You're the first human ever was kind to him... 
She scoops them expertly into a stack. 
WAVEY Accordingly. You're sick with guilt. 
Serves them to... 
WAVEY You sure you're not a complex guy? 
...Quoyle, who nods absently. About the one thing he is sure of. Just now, he's examining the prodigious status of her oxblood knitting. Still attached to the needles, it looks too broad for a muffler. 
QUOYLE (decides) Horse blanket. 
WAVEY (ah!) That's what that is! 
A beat.   Another. 
QUOYLE So if y'called around.      Musta found somepla... 
WAVEY (quietly) One decent golden age home. It's in St. John's. You can maybe afford it, tho God knows why you should. 
She pushes the flapjacks closer to him, CLANKS down the fork, eat! She's exasperated. Thinks he's wasting his money. 
QUOYLE I can't put him there, til I go down to St. John's. See it's all right. 
WAVEY Great!      Let's not be rash! 
QUOYLE Come with me. 
And everything.      Sorta.    Stops. 
QUOYLE I mean, the kids could stay with 
Dennis and Beety.       Or Agnis, or... 
A meaningful beat. 
WAVEY Why.   Would I. Do that? 
She looks deep in his eyes. Hard to guess the answer she wants to hear. He clears his throat. Looks down. 
QUOYLE Well. Remember when you said. Someday, I'd do something nice for you? 
And when he looks to her, she is... 
PETAL (Wavey's voice) And this is it. 
A witheringly sexy smile. 
QUOYLE Hey. Overnight trip to St. John's. All expenses paid. 
Petal arches a delicate brow. 
PETAL (Wavey's voice) Overnight? 
He blinks.   And sees... 
WAVEY What's wrong with a weekend? 
With a playful smile.      Of her own. 
EXT. DOUBLE-DECKER BUS, ST. JOHN'S - DAY 
Not London, but it might as well be. Wavey and Quoyle atop a red double-decker bus, wind whipping their hair. She is watching the big city flow past, drinking every inch of it. He's watching her. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 
Wavey carries an armload of little girl's tights and corduroy pants, picking through a bin of barrettes. Quoyle appears with a fistful of neckties. Holds them up hopefully to his chest one at a time, each more breathtakingly godawful than the last. Well? She SHIVERS with disgust. Lifts from her shopping bag a nice conser- vative one she's already picked for him. He SHIVERS, just as she did. They share the trace of a grin, just alike. He walks off. 
...Wavey trying on furry hats in a full-length mirror, as Quoyle keeps feeding her an endless supply from a double armful. She pouts and poses like a runway model, basically frowning that the 
hats aren't working. He's staring at her as if nothing else exists in the universe. She knows it. 
...Wavey alone at a cash register. The checker is ringing up a selection of lacy bras and panties. Suddenly, Wavey looks up to see Quoyle at the register one aisle over, staring fixedly at her purchases. Seeing she's noticed him, he holds up a huge pair of loud boxer shorts he's buying, and WAVES them at her. She laughs and waves her bras right back. Civilians watching think they're in love. 
EXT./INT. ST. JOHN'S - DAY/NIGHT 
...Quoyle and Wavey stroll the grounds of Nolan's future retirement home. It is twilight, and the modest place looks pleasant and welcoming. Quoyle listens earnestly, as the director points things out. Wavey watching Quoyle, her gaze not so disapproving after all. 
...CLOSE on Quoyle with a bowling ball, poised, glaring our way. Here he comes. Stumbles. Lets go. REVERSE ANGLE to see the ball rolling, rolling real slow. Quoyle turns his back, strides away with confidence like he doesn't even have to watch, this is too easy. Wavey points, look. He turns in time to see two pins fall. Pumps his fist. YESSSS! 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
It's late. It's dim. It's as romantic as urban Newfoundland will ever get. Our couple nursing beers at the corner table of a passably stylish bar. Piano playing show tunes, but soft. He pulls from his pocket... 
...a travel brochure.     Slightly drunk, completely merry, almost wicked smile. 
QUOYLE Three hours to drive from the Point, with all the ice. Alvin won't have my boat ready til New Years. Agnis can stay over her shop. Bunny and I have to find a room in town. 
DENNIS Stay with us. My kid follows yours around, they'll bunk t'gether. And we gotta fluffy couch that's more'n you deserve. 
A good friend.     Quoyle is touched. 
QUOYLE 
Hopin' you'd offer, almost worth it just t'inconvenience ya. Unfortunately, I'm too fond a yer wife. 
NUTBEEM (casual) Take my trailer. Timing's perfect. 
The way he said that.     They both turn.     A shrug... 
NUTBEEM It's two years. My boat's ready. If I stay any longer, I'll begin to like it here. 
Wouldn't want that. Very silent at this table.            Against the din of the place. Is he serious? 
NUTBEEM (softly) I'm throwing myself a farewell party on Saturday. Departure to follow Sunday. Regrets, soon after, no doubt. 
And smiles.    Serious as a heart attack.      A long beat. 
QUOYLE (a murmur) Be careful. 
Careful? 
QUOYLE Last friend left me.      Turned into a truck driver. 
So much feeling behind his eyes.     Nutbeem can only say... 
NUTBEEM Well.   With that warning. 
And return the feeling.     With his own. 
EXT./INT. NUTBEEM'S TRAILER - TWILIGHT 
Quoyle GROANING under the weight of cases of beer and cheap rum pulled from the back of his wagon. Plenty more to go. Staggers into... 
...Nutbeem's   tiny, threadbare trailer. Every conceivable surface under stacks   of plastic-wrapped party platters of cold cuts, cheese and red-eyed   olives. Nutbeem is jamming beers into tubs of ice. Quoyle peers   into the teensy closet that is the only bathroom... 
QUOYLE What's the barrel for? 
SEE it now.    Half a sawed-off empty BARREL, with MOLASSES stenciled 
in orange, fills the shower stall. 
NUTBEEM I'm British. I bathe. 
Quoyle sends him a blank look. 
QUOYLE Perfect for th' chips. 
He gestures to thirty bags of potato chips, filling the kitchenette. 
NUTBEEM It's coated with two kinds of scum. Soap. And mine. 
QUOYLE Works.    We forgot to buy dip. 
INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 
VIEW out a window at the line of HEADLIGHTS still arriving. We are immersed in the ungodly WHITE NOISE of an all-gentleman's Newfie soiree, music pushed beyond the level of distortion, assorted grunts, squeals, unintelligible words, things breaking. As we struggle to look around... 
...every square inch is    crammed tight with semi-conscious drunks. Tert Card and some boys    circle the potato chip barrel, which has become a handy urinal.     Near the door, Dennis holding forth, arm tight around Quoyle who    listens, listens, chuckles. Then Quoyle fights his way... 
...OUT of the trailer, to cold night air where the party is MUCH wilder, given the elbow room. Quoyle steps OVER the supine form o Billy Pretty, who is singing to himself. Finds Jack Buggit with a beer in one hand a rum in the other. Wraps a drunken arm around Jack's neck. Starts to talk in his ear. Jack looks suspicious. A FIGHT breaks out a few feet away. They don't notice. Closing in, to hear... 
QUOYLE (shouting against the din) SO THE NEXT DAY, THEY ALL SIT DOWN ON THE GIRDER. THE BRIT OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX. 'OH, NO! SCOTCH SALMON AGAIN! FAREWELL, BOYS!' AND HE JUMPS OFF THE GIRDER TO HIS DEATH. 
Jack nods.   Grins.    That's pretty funny. 
QUOYLE THE QUEBEC GUY OPENS HIS LUNCH BOX. 'MON DIEU! MEAT PIE AGAIN! AU REVOIR CRUEL WORLD!' AND HE JUMPS. 
This.   Is even funnier. 
QUOYLE NOW THE STATIE IS ALL ALONE ON THE GIRDER. HE OPENS HIS BOX. 'HOLY MOLEY! BOLOGNA SANDWICH AGAIN! I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE THIS!' AND LEAPS OFF. 
Funniest yet.   Jack is chuckling already. 
QUOYLE AT THE FUNERAL. THE BRIT' S WIFE SAYS, 'WHY DIDN'T HE TELL ME HE HATED SALMON?' FRENCHY'S WIFE SAYS, 'WHY DIDN'T HE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MEAT PIE?' STATIE'S WIFE SAYS, 'I DON'T GET IT. HE ALWAYS MADE HIS OWN LUNCH!' 
Quoyle is chortling.   But Jack stares him dead in the eyes. 
JACK YOU'RE SURE. THE FELLER WAS A STATIE. 
QUOYLE OH, YAR.    FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE. 
At which point Jack BUSTS OUT laughing fit to wet his pants... 
JACK MADE HIS OWN LUNCH! 
POUNDING on poor Quoyle, who is also dissolved in hysterics. Nearby, the biggest and ugliest GUY at the party (no small distinction) leaps onto a tree stump brandishing an AXE. Even in this crowd, it commands a certain degree of attention. 
BIG UGLY GUY NOW WE ALL LOVES OLD FOOKIN' NUTBEEM, YAR??? 
Cries of YAR! fill the woods. Nutbeem himself is HOISTED on shoulders, whooping and sloshing his grog. 
BIG UGLY GUY SO LESS KEEP 'IM 'ERE BYES! AXE 'IS FOOKIN' BOAT! GOT YER CHAIN SAW, NEDDIE?? 
An idea that wins IMMEDIATE MASS APPROVAL. Soused Nutbeem's eyes open bug-wide, as he is borne in a tidal wave of mayhem toward the docks. Whatever he is shrieking may well prove ineffective. 
And rather suddenly.   Quoyle is left alone. 
Among the conscious, that is. 
INT. WAVEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
JACK You were sayin'...? 
Quoyle sucks it up. 
QUOYLE His whole life would be changed. If he could come upon. A fishing license. 
Jack's eyes.   Flat and cold as the cod he's gutting. 
JACK Well, there's only one a those issued per family. So how exactly would he do that? 
This is not.   Going well.   A dangerous silence. 
JACK Even doughnuts, y'know.   Can push their luck. 
INT. WAVEY'S PARLOR - DUSK 
The day care contingent more organized today. Sort of. Bunny leading a spirited round of red-light/green-light, as... 
...Quoyle enters with a big cardboard box full of presents. As he shrugs off his coat, he looks at the Christmas tree, its winking lights. The decorations that seem to be everywhere, many handmade by these children. He watches Bunny call out 'Red Light!', only to have Herry ignore it and tackle her anyway. 
Mixed emotions, to be sure. A feeling of family he can at least visit, yet will never be his own. The sad edge catches up with him, so he strolls on into... 
...the kitchen. Wavey baking, what else.      She smiles to see him. A friend's smile. 
WAVEY (Southern belle) Why, Mistuh Quoyle. You shouldn't have! 
He smiles back.    Takes her in for a telling beat, before... 
QUOYLE Uh.   I didn't. Most of these 
are for Herry. 
Even better. 
QUOYLE There's two. Are yours. 
They are on top. Personally wrapped in his slightly bulging, fine-motor-control-challenged, personal style. Be sets them on the counter. 
QUOYLE You prob'ly want to wait for Christmas. 
Meaning, please don't. So she wipes her hands on her apron.    Lets him see her eyes dance just a flicker. 
WAVEY Oh, I'm much too excited. 
Delicately unwraps the first. Lifts out a PORCELAIN TEAPOT, finely painted with an assortment of BERRIES. She holds it in her hands, at once admiring and wistful. Wondering if there's a message about their moment together while berry-picking. 
QUOYLE It's from a museum catalogue.       But it's not real. It's a copy. 
WAVEY (still gazing at it) It is my favorite teapot. 
A simple pronouncement. She opens the second, flat and narrow. It is a TURQUOISE BRACELET. Actually, kind of stunning. She blinks, taken back by the beauty and perhaps the expense. 
QUOYLE It's nice for your eyes.     I thought. 
She doesn't sayanything.   Lets it dangle from her fingers, catch the light. 
QUOYLE It's for everyday. You don't have to save it for special. 
She looks to him. Her eyes are shining maybe more than she wants. Her voice perhaps softer than she even intends... 
WAVEY Oh, I'll save this, all right. 
Covers.   With only a slightly more than friendly smile. 
WAVEY And I'll think of you.     When I 
put lot on. 
He can only nod. He'd like that.    She holds up one finger, wait a second. And hurries off. 
So he waits. Looking at her kitchen. Feeling his feelings.         She is back, with two boxes. Sets them down. Nods, go ahead... 
...one is heavy and square. He opens it to find a LEATHER-BOUND CASE. He looks at her, smiles in his childlike way. Opens the case, which reveals... 
...two leather-bound VOLUMES. One a dictionary.      The other a thesaurus. He is obviously moved. 
QUOYLE (a murmur) You must have me mistaken. For a writer. 
And when he looks up. 
WAVEY I don't make mistakes.     About that kind of thing. 
He stares at her long enough to make her nod toward the other package. Big and flat, but not heavy at all. He lifts the lid, and pulls out... 
...a huge comfy SWEATER.   In oxblood wool.    He is completely stunned to realize... 
WAVEY (so pleased) Well, you can't be surprised. You've seen me knitting it for months. 
QUOYLE It was so big, I thought it was a tea cozy for your car. But if it's for me, it has to be bigger, huh? 
Put it on, put it on! So he slips it over his head. Big enough and then some. This worries her. She plucks at it... 
WAVEY Well.   You'll grow into it. 
QUOYLE You kiddin'? After the holidays, we'll have to stretch it. 
He's just beaming. Hugs himself to show how warm it is.      The silence is companionable. Then... 
QUOYLE Not used to a woman.     Giving me presents. 
She raises a brow.     Can scarcely believe that. 
QUOYLE One Christmas with Petal, I gave her eleven things. And I wrapped them. And watched her open them up. 
She holds her friendly smile.     But her eyes have changed. Slightly. 
She puts her toe out, SLIPS wildly, windmilling her arms, pantomiming as she bends double under the phantom clock. 
WAVEY Mite slick. Four feet thick a ice. 
Tears are streaming from a hundred eyes and more. 
WAVEY Meanwhile, at the bottom, Auntie Fizzard, 91 years young, sets out in her non-slip galoshes and her cane with the rubber tip. Didn't yer, dearie? 
Bows to the old gal in the front row, who is scarlet-faced in hysterics, as all around her applaud. Wavey becomes her, inching along, casting fierce glances right and left to warn the world. 
WAVEY Meanwhile, at the top... 
She is Billy once more, beneath his burden, her long legs stutter- stepping to one side, then the other, slipping, skidding, the howling all around her threatening to shatter walls, and... 
WAVEY ...OVER he goes, clock-side down, and PICKIN' UP SPEED! 
Miming the wild ride as they ROAR... 
WAVEY ...eight blocks, NINE, missing everything like a miracle, zeroing in on... 
She becomes Auntie Fizzard once more, shuffling, looking left, right, and suddenly up WILD-EYED! 
WAVEY CLIPS 'er inta the snow bank! 
Nods sadly.   Leaning on her cane.     When at last they quiet. 
WAVEY Just two galoshes stickin' outta the snow. She digs 'er way out. Brushes herself off. Looks at him sprawled like a turtle on his back, tied to his massive burden. She says... 
She says. 
WAVEY YOU THERE!     BILLY PRETTY! 
Levels a dead-eyed killer gaze. 
WAVEY WHY CAN'T YOU WEAR A WRISTWATCH LIKE EVER'BODY ELSE? 
The place comes DOWN like a house of cards. Bedlam surrounds Quoyle who sits still as a stone. Too dazzled to breathe. 
EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - EARLY MORNING. 
Lonely stretch of wooded road, middle of nowhere. Light snow just starting to fall. A truck pulls up beneath a tree. Out climbs... 
...Wavey. Looking grim, walking slow. Crosses the road to a weathered diner. The woman who only smokes when she's worried, pulls out a pack of Camels. Looks through the diner's frosted window... 
...a lone customer sits nursing his coffee. He is 40, lean, very attractive. Dark hard eyes, set into worries of their own. Wavey lights up. Watches in silence until... 
...the man looks up. Their eyes meet through the glass.      Hold. And on his faint smile... 
She turns her back.   Starts up the road. 
ANGLE...he is walking beside her now. Snow drifting lazy, her smoke curling up. He watches her anger, how cold and quiet and closed. Smiles at her profile... 
HEROLD I shoulda come last night.     Seen the show. 
She can't even believe he said that.     Never looking at him... 
WAVEY Woulda been a thrill for the Christians among' em. They think you're dead. 
Keep walking.   His smile is gentle. 
HEROLD Well, then we got good news for th... 
WAVEY So does your son. 
A beat. 
HEROLD Even better news for him. 
WAVEY (low) You think so. 
Breaking the words off.   He's watching her profile. 
HEROLD (very soft) I can't undo the hurt I've done. Unless you let me. 
Gauging the feeling behind the bitterness. 
HEROLD There's a million reasons to send me away. Good ones. And only two reasons not to. 
Is she even listening?     He lets the silence hang. 
HEROLD I love you. And you love me. 
She stops walking.     Flips her cigarette off into the snow.       Turns now... 
Looks into his face.     And sighs. 
EXT. SHORELINE - DAY 
Rear ANGLE of Agnis, crouching in the lightly falling snow. At the edge of the sea. The spot where she once sent her dog to rest. HEAR footfalls crunching slowly across the rocks. A bulky figure comes into frame. Crouches down beside her. Close. She stares at the gray horizon. 
QUOYLE (softly) Mavis Bangs. Told me where you'd be. 
No answer.   But she hears him all right. 
QUOYLE We get so little mention in the wires. Thought you'd like to see. 
He hands the folded print-out to her. 
QUOYLE Head in the suitcase.       The mystery's solved. 
She looks briefly at his eyes.        Takes it.   Starts to read. 
QUOYLE Silver Melville was captured in Moored with a cruise steward. The boy was twenty, a looker, wearing Armani clothes. Driving a nice Lexus. 
Agnis keeps reading. 
She's looking at her cup now.     Not at him. 
WAVEY Came back one summer.     Fell for Herold Prowse. That.      Was that. 
Takes a swallow.     Closes her eyes. 
WAVEY Did you know I was a liar? 
Opens her eyes.     Straight into his.     Did you? 
WAVEY Herold liked other women.     But you know how that is. 
Sure you do. 
WAVEY (whispers) He didn't die. Not that he didn't deserve to. 
Quoyle blinks.     A perfect stunned ox gape. 
WAVEY See, I'm a good liar. 
Drains her cup. 
WAVEY He ran off to Seattle with some bitch. When his damaged son was two months old. And nobody knew. 
An ice-cold wink. 
WAVEY Like I said. It's four years ago. And it's yesterday. 
Pours herself another.     Savors the memory. 
WAVEY So I took his boat out. I sunk it. And told my little story. Grieving widow. 
Shrugs a drunken, careless shrug. 
WAVEY I was leaving, of course. Why humiliate myself on the wayout? 
Yes? 
WAVEY (softer) But a funny thing happened.        On 
my way out. 
Her eyes are deeper now.      And for a beat, the anger slips away. 
WAVEY All these funny, odd little folks? They put their hearts around me. So I wouldn't be alone. Having lost the man I loved. 
Silence.   A real one. 
WAVEY And since I knew, to my shame, that is exactly what I had lost. I let go of the will to leave. I did. 
I did. 
WAVEY Decided to let my child grow up. Around folks better than his mom. 
Stares in his eyes. 
WAVEY You're quite the talker. 
QUOYLE (quiet) I take pride in that. 
So she smiles.     But the bitterness is there in it. 
WAVEY Well, this morning.     The man I loved. Came back. 
And the world. Ceases to spin.         One man's world, at least.   She watches that. Assesses it. 
WAVEY Told me he knew.     I loved him still. 
Sips at her second drink.        Slides the rest of it down. 
WAVEY Okay. Now I'm drunk enough.         To talk about Petal. 
Her eyes ask.    Are you? 
WAVEY You're thinking we're kindred souls, you and me. In love with our nightmares. 
Shakes her head.     Uh-uh. 
WAVEY You don't love your Petal. You hate. Her cheating. Guts. 
Means those words as an opening blow.      Jacks or better.      Here comes the hole card... 
WAVEY You have to think it's love. Because if it's not, you're dead inside. So you keep that flame a flickering. Cos it's all you'll ever have. 
Pure contempt.     And honesty. 
WAVEY You see.   You're a good liar, too. 
Lifts the cap.     Screws it back on the bottle. 
WAVEY Where's the damn eggshells?     That's all I came to see. 
And from his prison of shock and shame.      He points to a shelf.      She is OFF his desk, like a panther... 
...SNATCHES the tiny padded box with its treasure.          RAISES it high to smash it, and... 
...stops.    To see the panic.    In his eyes. 
It brings tears.     Pooling in hers. 
And she sets the treasure down, with the tenderness that decency requires. 
WAVEY Can you guess how I know about Petal? 
He cannot. 
Quoyle and Alvin inspect Quoyle's newly-finished boat. It is a beauty, to be sure, and the old builder watches Quoyle lovingly running his hand across the smooth gunnel. Alvin doesn't smile. That's not his style. 
ALVIN Gotta paint the name. What'll it be? 'The Tall And Quiet Woman'? 
Quoyle glances over.     The old boy's eyes are dancing. 
QUOYLE You knew Billy's dad? 
ALVIN Ever'body knows ever'body. But Billy's pap didn't invent the Four Women in a Man's Life. 
Quoyle nods.   Guess not. 
ALVIN Well. Which one is Bunny, I wonder? The Maid in the Meadow, mebbe. 
But Yoda is just staring at him.     And quietly... 
ALVIN Doncha know? They're all the same woman. That's the point. 
His pupil blinks.   Like a crystal bullet of clarity his brain. 
ALVIN The Maid in the Meadow, that's her innocence and play. The Stouthearted Woman, is when you need to lean on her. 
For some reason he could never name.     Tears are pooling in eyes. 
ALVIN The Tall and Quiet Woman? That's the silent partner who always walks 'longside, so's yer never alone. 
Quoyle is nodding, now.     It all seems so right. 
ALVIN And the Demon Lover. That's just the frostin' on th' cake. 
A soft knocking at the door. 
ALVIN When y'find the woman who's all four? That's when y'got yer one true love. 
The bird-like woman enters.     The old man nods toward her. 
ALVIN ...like m'Gertie. 
But she isn't alone. A man enters behind her. It is Dennis Buggit. And there are tears on his face. He brings a dreadful silence with him, because the face is an open grave. 
DENNIS My dad went over the side this mornin'. Tangled in th' sling- stone line. 
A sob escapes from this strong man's throat.    He ignores it.    No one knows what to say. 
DENNIS If you could write a memorial t' him. Fer t'morrow's Gammy Bird? I'd be real grateful. 
EXT. JACK BUGGIT'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The road is jammed with parked cars and trucks and vans and wagons Folks still streaming toward the brightly-lit house. Ever'body knows ever'body. 
INT. JACK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Every room is filled with folks who wear their best. There is eating and chatter and even some pockets of laughter, as we move through the crowd. As if some have taken hold of a wake's well- meaning purpose. Others stand dazed, still wearing their pain and confusion. There are children here, some hold a parent's hand, some giggle with each other. Snapshot of a community. Struggling to cope. 
Quoyle and Bunny enter, holding hands, looking around.      As they cross the room... 
...two figures step into their path. Two women holding hands, their bodies close together. Their feeling for each other open for all to see. One is Agnis. And the other. Isn't Mavis Bangs. 
DAWN Happy New Year, Mr. Quoyle. I'm sorry I missed you at the pageant. 
Slightly startled, Quoyle can't help but smile, despite the solemn occasion. At the proud look on his aunt's face. 
DAWN I was in the wings, a course. Wasn't our girl somethin'? 
Our girl, a course, is Agnis.   Who nearly blushes at the compliment. 
DAWN I say, y'have t'love a woman. Who's in touch with her inner chicken. 
Well, who could argue with that. Dawn leans up, kisses Quoyle on the cheek. And with surprising softness... 
AGNIS Nephew.   You okay? 
BUNNY He's okay.     He's not sleeping in the box. 
Her great aunt looks at this child. Bends to plant an unexpected kiss on the top of Bunny's head. The kid squirms, tugs her dad firmly off, as he sends a parting wave. 
Into the parlor now. Quieter here, as the new arrivals thread past Jack Buggit in his open coffin, resting on black-draped sawhorses. Dennis and his mom stand by Jack, a hand and a word for each. And moving into the line... 
QUOYLE Remember what I told you. 
His words a murmur.     Hers are bolder... 
BUNNY If he's not sleeping.     Why do they call it a awake? 
He thinks.   As if it is a worthwhile question. 
QUOYLE We're the ones have to be awake. To how much we love him... 
Nods to himself.     Yes. 
QUOYLE And how we should be good to each other. While we have the chance. 
He looks down.     They are almost there. 
QUOYLE You think? 
She is thinking. Keeping the thoughts to herself. At the coffin now, he lifts her up to see. Jack lies motionless, a wax figure of himself. Serene behind violet eyelids. 
BUNNY He looks like he's sleeping. 
Dennis looks over.     His stolid, grim face releases a smile for his friend. 
QUOYLE That's cos he's peaceful. No worries, anymore. No troubles. 
He sets her down.     Clasps Mrs. Buggit's hand.     And from his

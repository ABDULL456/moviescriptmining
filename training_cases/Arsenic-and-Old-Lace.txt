A general overview of Brooklyn, near New York, seen from the roof of a very high building. Written in white letters on this overview, the following words : 
This is a Hallowe'en tale of Brooklyn, where anything can happen-- and it usually does. 
Then : At 3 P.M. on this particular day, this was happening- 
Several white circles move on the screen, then the whole screen is covered by a huge base ball, with «Brooklyn» written on it in black letters. 
BASEBALL GAME - SPECTATORS - EXTERIOR DAY 
Close-up of the face of man, screaming :

The camera moves away, so we can see the other baseball spectators behind the first one.

Finally we see a batter missing his ball. We hear the Umpire, standing behind the catcher and heavily covered with a protection suit, yelling : 
THE UMPIRE Strike ! You're out ! 
The batter, who missed the ball, drops his bat on the ground and comes back to the Umpire. He tears the Umpire helmet and mask away, and gives him a good punch in the nose. The Umpire falls on the ground. The catcher then hits the batter. The Umpire rises slowly from the ground. 
Several very quick sequences : The ball-thrower drops his glove and runs to the fight. Then several excited spectators stand up to join the fight.

Then a final view of the Umpire, laying on the field and leaning on one elbow, and quietly munching some food. 
NEW YORK - A BRIDGE - EXTERIOR DAY 
We see a large view of a bridge with a white boat passing underneath. Written in large white letters on the screen, the words : 
While at the same time across the river in the UNITED STATE PROPER there was a romance in the air. 
MARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU - INTERIOR DAY 
Close-up on the sign «MARRIAGE LICENSE BUREAU», with people passing underneath. 
AN EXCITED GIRL VOICE Elmer, here it is. 
A MORE QUIET MALE VOICE I knew you'd find it. 
ANOTHER MALE VOICE Boy, I could sure use a drink. 
The camera gets down from the sign to floor level. Two journalists are approaching, one equipped with a camera. 
THE PHOTOGRAPHER I wonder if any big shots are getting married today ? They stop at the door of the room. 
Larger view of the room, where several people are, either standing in a queue, either sitting at a table and filling forms, either chatting in groups of two or three 
Back to the two journalists still standing a the door. 
THE OTHER JOURNALIST Looks like the same suckers get married every day. 
He looks around for a few second, then starts to move away. 
THE OTHER JOURNALIST Come on. 
The photographer makes him come back. He points to someone in the room. 
THE PHOTOGRAPHER Hey, the guy with the cheaters. 
In a line of people queueing in front of a counter, we see Mortimer Brewster, with a hat and a pair of large dark glasses. He turns around and notices the two journalists looking at him. He raises the collar of his black coat to try to hide his face. The girl in front of him turns around to look at him. She has blonde curly hair and wears a hat with a strange white feather. She is Elaine Harper. With both his hands, Mortimer turns her face back toward the counter. 
Back to the two journalists at the door of the room. 
THE OTHER JOURNALIST Now what's he hiding from ? 
He starts moving to get a better look at Mortimer. Mortimer moves in front of Elaine, who smiles. 
The two journalists are now in the room, and they look at Mortimer. 
THE OTHER JOURNALIST Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster? 
THE PHOTOGRAPHER Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic ? 
Mortimer looks very embarrassed. 
Back to the two journalists. 
THE OTHER JOURNALIST No, it's not him. But what a scoop it would be ! The guy who wrote The Bachelor's Bible finally getting hooked himself. Nope. It's too good to be true. Come on, let's snap the mayor in his new fire helmet and go home. THE PHOTOGRAPHER Hey, let's stick around, and see who the guy is. 
Back to the line of people waiting in front of the counter. The marriage clerk is standing behind a set of metal bars. A couple of people leaves the counter. It's now Mortimer and Elaine's turn. The marriage clerk sings : 
THE CLERK "Two by two they come and go. Hip hip hig hay !" 
He smiles to Mortimer and Elaine. 
THE CLERK Good morning, children. Your name, please ? 
ELAINE Elaine Harper. 
She spoke in a very soft voice. The clerk put his hand around his ear. THE CLERK Speak a little louder. 
She speaks louder. 
ELAINE Elaine Harper. 
THE CLERK Thank you. Yours ? 
Mortimer comes very close to the bars above the counter and whispers. 
MORTIMER Mortimer Brewster. The clerk puts his hand back around his ear. 
The two journalists are straining their own ears to be able to understand Mortimer's name 
BROPHY They don't rent rooms. But you can bet if anybody came looking for a room, they wouldn't go away without a good meal and probably a couple of bucks in their pockets. That's just their way of digging up people to do good to. 
We get a closer view of the front of the house. A large rectangular stone, with «Brewster» engraved on it. A group of children runs in front of the house. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
In the forefront of the room, Teddy Brewster is playing Mozart's Turkish March on the harpsichord. He looks a bit like late President Theodore Roosevelt. And he is dressed like the President was dressed on the official pictures we've got of him... And, like the President, he is wearing a pince-nez. 
In another corner of the room, Abby Brewster is having tea with Reverend Harper, Elaine's father. She looks like an old English lady, a bit like Agatha Christie's Miss Marple. 
ABBY Reverend Harper, I do hope you don't disapprove of Mortimer just because he's a dramatic critic and takes your daughter to the theater every night. 
REVEREND HARPER It's not so much that I disapprove of his being a critic, but no man, no man with this published attitude on marriage... 
Close-up on the book Reverend Harper just took on the table : «Marriage, a Fraud and a Failure, by Mortimer Brewster». REVEREND HARPER ...should take any man's daughter anyplace... 
He sneezes. 
REVEREND HARPER ...at any time. 
He sneezes again, louder this time. Teddy stops playing and there is a puzzled look in his eyes. 
TEDDY I must be catching cold. 
ABBY (to Teddy) No, dear. It was Reverend Harper who sneezed. (to Reverend Harper) Bless you. 
Teddy puts back in his pocket the handkerchief he had taken out and starts playing again. 
ABBY We mustn't be angry with Mortimer. He's so very much in love with her. And Sister Martha and I are so happy about it. He used to come to see us only occasionally, and now, now he's in Brooklyn six nights a week. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY 
The two cops, Brophy and O'Hara, are mounting the steps to the Brewster sisters house. 
BROPHY Remember now, watch your language. 
O'HARA Besides, you know I'm not a swearing man. 
BROPHY You'd be surprised what they'd consider swearing. 
He rings the doorbell. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
At the sound of the doorbell, Teddy stops playing. 
ABBY Oh, will you excuse me ? 
She gets up from her armchair. 
ABBY No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go. 
She goes to the door and opens it. 
ABBY Oh, come right in, Mr. Brophy. 
The two cops get in. 
BROPHY Miss Abby, we came for the toys. 
ABBY Oh yes. 
O'Hara closes the door. 
BROPHY This is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over my beat. 
O'HARA How are you doing ? 
ABBY May I welcome you to our neighborhood, Mister O'Hara. 
Teddy, with his teacup in hand, joins the group. He speaks with a very serious expression on his face. 
TEDDY Gentlemen, what news have you brought me ? 
Brophy salutes him and stands at attention. 
BROPHY Colonel, we have nothing to report. 
Teddy gives an intrigued look to O'Hara, who doesn't seem to understand. Brophy elbows him with the arm which is still saluting. 
O'HARA Huh ? He eventually understands what his Sargent is trying to tell him. 
O'HARA Oh no, absolutely nothing to report. 
He salutes but with a less official attitude than his Sargent. Teddy smiles. 
TEDDY Splendid ! Thank you, gentlemen. (very serious again) At ease. 
Brophy puts his arm down. O'Hara looks at his Sargent with a perplexed expression, and takes longer to put his arm down 
ABBY You know the Reverend Doctor Harper from the church next door ? 
BROPHY Hello, Reverend. This is Officer O'Hara, the new man on the beat. 
Teddy looks at O'Hara with a puzzled expression. 
O'HARA How do you do, sir ? It's nice to meet you. 
O'Hara looks ill at ease under Teddy's stare. 
ABBY The toys are on the chair up here, by the library door. 
O'Hara moves toward the pile of toys. Teddy's eyes are following him with the same puzzled expression. O'Hara feels less and less at ease. 
ABBY Oh, Teddy, will you run upstairs and bring down your Army and Navy from Aunt Martha's room. They're all packed. 
REVEREND HARPER That's splendid work you men do, fixing up discarded toys for the kids at camp. 
Teddy, who has started to mount the stairs to the upper level, stops in his stride, pretends he is taking a sword out of a sheath at his side, points this imaginary sword in front of him and starts running up the stairs, yelling : 
TEDDY Charge ! 
When he arrives on the balcony, on which open the bedroom doors, he rushes into his room and slams the door. 
While Bophy and Reverend Harper remain unmoved, O'Hara, who is standing by the grandfather's clock, jumps and looks at the clock, which chimes once. The minute hand of the clock falls down to the half-hour position. O'Hara is very disturbed and points his stick to his Sargent, who seems to be totally unmoved by the event and laughs with Reverend Harper and Abby. 
BROPHY It gives us something to do as we are sitting around the station. You get tired of playing cards. 
Abby moves away from them to the grandfather's clock. She puts the minute hand back into its original position. Brophy and Reverend Harper joins her by the clock. 
BROPHY So these are the toys ? 
O'HARA Well... So long, Colonel. 
Teddy looks at him and then looks at Brophy, who doesn't salute him. O'Hara elbows his Sargent with the arm which is saluting. 
O'HARA Hey, Sarge. 
BROPHY Hey ? 
Brophy looks at Teddy and understands the situation. He also salutes Teddy. 
BROPHY Oh, yes. 
Teddy salutes them. 
TEDDY Dismissed ! 
Brophy and O'Hara bring their arms down. 
BROPHY Well, goodbye and thank you. ABBY Good bye. 
Abby opens the front door. The two cops start going out, Brophy first. 
ABBY Careful of the step here now with the toys. 
BROPHY Good night. 
O'Hara goes out, and then comes one step back and shows his face behind the door. He winks to Teddy. Teddy raises his eyebrows. 
TEDDY Young man, let that be a lesson to you. 
O'Hara chuckles, then makes a strange face, and goes out. 
ABBY Goodbye. She closes the door, and goes back to her sister and Reverend Harper. 
ABBY Well... 
REVEREND HARPER Well, I must be going. 
Teddy, still carrying his model warship, starts mounting the stairs, stops after a few steps, takes his imaginary sword out, points it forward and runs upstairs, yelling : 
TEDDY Charge ! 
He reaches the balcony, turns toward the balustrade and yells. 
TEDDY Charge the blockhouse ! 
He goes into his room and slams the door behind him. We hear the grandfather's clock chiming once. 
Reverend Harper looks up at the balcony, then turns to the Brewster sisters with puzzled eyes. 
REVEREND HARPER Blockhouse ? 
MARTHA Oh, the stairs are always San Juan Hill. 
REVEREND HARPER Oh, I... 
But Reverend Harper doesn't finish his sentence and sneezes very loudly. He takes his handkerchief out of his pocket to put it under his nose. 
ABBY Bless you ! 
REVEREND HARPER Have you ever tried to persuade him he wasn't Teddy Roosevelt ? 
ABBY Oh, no ! 
She goes to the grandfather's clock. 
MARTHA Oh, he's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt. 
Abby moves the minute hand of the clock back in place. 
ABBY Oh, do you remember, Martha ? She comes back to her sister and Reverend Harper. 
ABBY Once, a long time ago, we thought if he'd be George Washington, it might be a change for him, and we suggested it. 
MARTHA And do you know what happened ? He just stayed under his bed for days and wouldn't be anybody. 
Reverend Harper laughs. 
REVEREND HARPER Well, if he's happy, and what's more important, you're happy... 
He starts walking toward the front door, followed by the Brewster sisters. He reaches the door and opens it. 
MARTHA Oh, our only worry for Teddy is after we are gone. 
They all go out. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY 
The three of them are coming out of the house. 
REVEREND HARPER Yes, indeed. That is quite a problem. 
ABBY But Mortimer's made all the arrangements for Teddy to go to Happy Dale Sanitarium after we pass on. 
REVEREND HARPER Splendid idea ! A very pleasant place. 
MARTHA Yes... 
Reverend Harper put his hat back on his head, and starts walking toward his own house. 
ABBY Dear, sweet Reverend Harper. 
The two sisters look at him. We see him cross the churchyard and enter his house. 
ABBY You know, Martha, I really do believe he's beginning to see the light. 
They start walking back to the door of their house. 
MARTHA I'm sure we needn't worry about him. He won't interfere with our plans for Mortimer and Elaine. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
The two sisters enter their house. Martha closes the door. 
MARTHA Oh, did you just have tea ? 
ABBY Yes. And dinner's going to be late, too. 
MARTHA Ohh ! Why ? 
They both turn their heads toward the stairs, because they just heard Teddy's door slamming. 
Back to the tree. The couple is hidden by the tree. They separate and move a little away from each other, each one of them appearing on either side the tree. 
Elaine drags Mortimer by the hand from behind the tree. ELAINE But, Mortimer, you're going to love me for my mind, too ? 
MORTIMER One thing at a time. 
She starts running away from him. 
ELAINE Oh ! There's that look again ! 
Mortimer comes slowly from behind the tree, clowning. 
MORTIMER «There's that look again, Mortimer !» You better get used to it. 
He becomes more serious and come closer to her. 
MORTIMER Look like you're going to see it often. It goes just before this. He kisses her very passionately. 
MORTIMER You know what we're doing, darling ? We're wasting time. Look, I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your old... No, you'd better not tell your father just yet. You'll run that cold of his into a pneumonia. 
ELAINE Oh, I can handle Father. He's a dear. 
MORTIMER Look, why don't we wire him from Niagara Falls ? 
ELAINE Niagara Falls ? 
Mortimer nods. 
ELAINE Then that's why you stopped at your office. 
MORTIMER Yes, certainly ! We're going to go the whole hog. Niagara Falls ! Everybody ought to go to Niagara Falls. You should've seen my secretary's face when I made the reservation. We've got a drawing-room on the train, the bridal suite in the hotel, and tomorrow morning we go over the falls in a barrel. 
Elaine kisses Mortimer very passionately. 
MORTIMER Go on, darling, hurry and pack. 
ELAINE I don't have to. I started packing the day after I met you. She starts moving away. He holds her back. 
MORTIMER There, you see ! You see ? That's what I mean. That's what I hate about women. 
Mortimer kisses her. 
Back to the cab driver who is pacing in front of his car. He rubs his chin. 
CAB DRIVER I wonder what Mary's doing now ? 
Mortimer and Elaine are still kissing. Mortimer lets go of Elaine. He puts her hat on her head. 
MORTIMER Go on, darling, the train leaves in an hour, and hurry. 
ELAINE It'll be a few minutes before I'm ready. Father may want to pray over me a little. 
She moves away. 
MORTIMER Whistle when you're ready. Oh, Elaine... 
She turns around. 
ELAINE Yeah. 
MORTIMER When you whistle, open the front door fast. If you see a tall, dark streak of light, it's me. 
He starts running toward his aunts' house. Elaine runs to her father's house. 
She stops at the door of her house and starts whistling. 
Mortimer, who had also reached his door, stops and turns around. 
MORTIMER What ? Now ? 
He starts running toward her, but she stops him. 
ELAINE No, not now ! 
She opens her door. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
The two sisters are eagerly waiting for Mortimer. Martha whispers. MARTHA Look surprised when he tells us. 
Abby laughs. They hear a door slamming in the next room. 
MORTIMER (voice over) Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha ! 
Mortimer rushes into the room and throws his hat on a chair. 
MORTIMER Hold on to your bustles. We're married. Elaine and I are married. 
The two sisters hug and kiss Mortimer. 
ABBY Oh, darling, how wonderful ! Oh, Martha, isn't it wonderful ? They're married! 
MORTIMER Yeah ! Don't pretend to be so surprised either, you two old frauds. Can I use the telephone, darling ? 
ABBY Yes, of course. 
Mortimer goes to the telephone, followed by his two aunts. 
ABBY Isn't it too, too wonderful ? 
Mortimer sits at the small desk on which the telephone is, and whistles while dialing. 
MARTHA And to think that it happened right here in this room ! 
She dabs her nose with her handkerchief. 
MORTIMER Oh, now, here, here, now ! Hello ?... Hello ? Benson's Florists ? This is Mortimer Brewster. Did you send those roses to Missis Brewster's apartment ?... You did ? Good. Now, send four dozen more to drawing room A, Canadian Limited, Grand Central Station. Yes... And hurry then. And throw in a flock of orange blossoms. 
He puts the telephone receiver back on his hook, and he turns on his chair to face his aunts, his arms resting on the back of the chair. 
ABBY But before you go, we can have our celebration. I'll open a bottle of wine and we'll sing. And we'll invite a few of the neighbors in. 
MARTHA And, of course, a wedding cake. MORTIMER Oh, darling, you won't have time to bake a cake. We're going to Niagara Falls. I've got a taxi waiting. 
ABBY Oh, it's all ready. It's been ready since.. 
MORTIMER Yeah, I bet it's been ready since the first day I met her, huh ? 
He stands up. 
MORTIMER What is it ? Did everybody in Brooklyn know I was getting married, except me ? 
Mortimer shows a forced smile. 
The two sisters puts things on the table, then they come to Mortimer, who is still seated on the window-seat. Abby is carrying a big bowl of rice, and the two girls start throwing rice on him. 
ABBY Happy bridegroom ! 
MARTHA Congratulations, darling ! 
MORTIMER Never mind that now. I know. 
Mortimer takes the bowl from Abby's hands and put it on a small table. He remains seated while his aunts are standing in front of him. 
MORTIMER Now, listen, darlings. Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha, you know how we've always planned to send Teddy to that Sanitarium, Happy Dale ? 
ABBY Oh, yes, dear. That's after we're gone. 
They move away to start setting the table. 
ABBY Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper about it. 
MORTIMER No, no. Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now. At once ! Now, he's down in the cellar. Get him up here right away. 
MARTHA But, there's no such hurry as yet, you know. 
ABBY No... When Teddy's working on the canal, you can't get his mind on anything else. 
Mortimer stands up and comes to the table where his aunts are working. 
MORTIMER Well, look, darlings. Look, I'm frightfully sorry, but I've got an awful shock for you. 
He takes Abby's hands in his. 
MORTIMER Teddy's killed a man, darlings ! 
Martha laughs. 
MARTHA Nonsense ! 
MORTIMER (he yells) But there's a body in the window-seat ! 
ABBY Yes, dear. We know. 
Mortimer looks even more shocked than before. His two aunts keep on setting the table as if nothing had happened. 
MORTIMER You know ? 
MARTHA Of course. 
ABBY Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy. 
Mortimer wants to speak, but Abby stops him. 
ABBY Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it. Forget you ever saw the gentleman. MORTIMER Forget ? 
ABBY We never dreamed you'd peek. 
MORTIMER What the... Who is he ? 
ABBY He's a Mister Hoskins. Adam Hoskins. That's really all I know about him, except that he's a Methodist. 
MARTHA Oh ! He's a Methodist ? Isn't that nice. 
MORTIMER That's all you know ? But what's he doing here ? What happened to him ? 
Mortimer is more and more shocked and his aunts, very calmly, keep on putting plates and silverware on the table. MARTHA He died. 
MORTIMER Look, Aunt Martha, men just don't get into window-seats and die. 
ABBY No, dear. He died first. 
Mortimer takes his aunts' hands to stop them from setting the table. 
MORTIMER Oh, well, now wait ! Stop all this. 
He takes Abby's hands in his. 
MORTIMER Now look, darlings, how did he die ? 
ABBY Oh, Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive. The gentleman died because he drank some wine with poison in it. 
MORTIMER But, how did the poison get in the wine ? 
MARTHA Well we put it in wine because it's less noticeable. When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor. 
MORTIMER You mean you... (yelling) You put it in the wine ? ABBY Yes. And I put Mister Hoskins in the window-seat, because Reverend Harper was coming. 
Mortimer seems ready to faint. 
MORTIMER Ohh ! Look at me, darling. 
He takes again Abby's hands in his. 
MORTIMER You mean, you mean you knew what you'd done and you didn't want the Reverend Harper to see the body ? 
ABBY Well, not at tea. That wouldn't have been very nice. 
Abby goes back table-setting and Mortimer holds himself on the edge of the table. 
MORTIMER Ohh ! It's first-degree. 
ABBY Now, Mortimer, you know all about it and just forget about it. I do think that Martha and I have the right to our own little secrets. 
Martha walks to the kitchen door, but she stops and turns around. 
MARTHA Oh, Abby, while I was out I dropped in on Missis Schultz. She's much better. But she wants us to take Junior to the movies again. 
ABBY Well, we must do that, tomorrow or next day. 
MARTHA Yes, but this time we'll go where we want to go. Junior's not going to drag me into another one of those scary pictures. 
The two sisters enter the kitchen. 
ABBY No, they ought not to be allowed to make those pictures just to frighten people. 
Mortimer remains alone in the room. He has the face of someone who thinks he is having a nightmare and hopes to wake up soon. 
He goes to the telephone desk, picks up the phone and dials «0». 
MORTIMER Operator ?... Can you hear my voice ?... You can ?... Are you sure ?... 
He puts the phone down. MORTIMER Then I must be here. 
He realizes there is no one on the phone, and puts it back down. MORTIMER Now, let's see. Where were we ? Twelve. (he yells) Twelve ! 
He jumps from his chair and rushes toward the kitchen. But, when he sees his two aunts setting the table, he stops and goes to them. 
MARTHA Yes, dear. Abby thinks we should count the first one. 
MORTIMER Never mind about that. Just sit down. 
Martha sits down. 
MORTIMER Now, tell me, who was the first one ? 
ABBY Mister Midgely. He was a Baptist. 
MARTHA He was such a lonely, old gentleman, Mister Midgely was. 
ABBY All his kith and kin were dead. 
MARTHA We felt so sorry for him. 
ABBY And then, when his heart attack came, and he sat there dead in that chair, looking so peaceful. Remember, Martha ? We made up our minds, then and there, that if we could help other lonely, old men to find that same peace, we would. MORTIMER Why, you poor... You mean, he dropped dead right in this chair ? 
Mortimer realizes it's the chair he's sitting on, and stands up very quickly. 
ABBY And then, you see, Teddy came up from digging in Panama, and he thought Mister Midgely was a yellow-fever victim. And that meant he had to be buried immediately. 
MORTIMER So ? 
MARTHA So, we all took him down to Panama, and put him in the lock and gave him a decent Christian burial. There, now you see ? (she stands up) That's why we told you not to bother about it, because we know exactly what's to be done. Mortimer is sitting on the table, and seems not to know what he must do next. But he suddenly stands up. 
MORTIMER Wait a minute ! 
He rushes to his aunts. 
MORTIMER Come here, darlings. What about the others ? All twelve of them didn't walk in here and drop dead. 
ABBY Oh, no, dear. Of course not ! 
MORTIMER Well, so, so... 
Abby whispers something in Martha's ear. Martha looks at Mortimer, smiles, and whispers back in her sister's ear. 
MARTHA Mortimer. 
MORTIMER Wh... what? 
MARTHA Do you remember those jars of poison that were on the shelves in Grandfather's laboratory all these years ? 
ABBY You know your Aunt Martha's knack for mixing things. You've eaten enough of her piccalilli. 
MARTHA Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine, I take one teaspoonful of arsenic, then add half a teaspoonful of strychnine. And then, just a pinch of cyanide. 
MORTIMER Mmmm ! Should have quite a kick. 
ABBY Yes, as a matter of fact, one of our gentlemen found time to say : «How delicious !» 
MORTIMER He did ? Well, wasn't that nice of him ? 
MARTHA Abby, we mustn't be standing here gossiping all night. Well, we must get that cake frosted. 
She moves toward the kitchen, followed by Abby. 
MORTIMER Oh no, darling, don't worry about the cake. I couldn't eat a thing. ABBY Oh, you newlyweds! A sip of wine will give you an appetite. 
MORTIMER That'd be nice, darling, a sip of... A sip of wine ! 
He stands up. 
MORTIMER Wine ! 
He wants to move away, but his foot get entangled in the back of a chair, and he almost falls down. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR DAY 
Elaine appears at the window of her room. She is arranging the artificial flower on the lapel of her jacket. She moves away from the window. 
The cab driver is still pacing on the sidewalk near his car. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Mortimer closes the drapes between the sitting-room and the next room. He then goes to the cellar door and opens the door ajar. A cat meows and comes out through the opening. We hear Teddy singing down in the cellar. 
MORTIMER I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this. 
He listens to the singing coming from the cellar. 
MORTIMER He's wonderful. Happy as a lark. Singing away, digging locks. He closes the cellar door. 
MORTIMER Got him working on a yellow-fever victim. Oh, I can see the headlines now : «Murder Incorporator Rides Again» right across the front page. Let me see... Teddy ! Of course. Everybody knows he's crazy. Let me see. Who can I call up ? Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell ? No, Winchell's no good. Old Judge Cullman ! 
He starts moving across the room, putting his hand in the inside breast pocket of his jacket. 
MORTIMER I wonder if I got his number. 
He gets a couple of tickets out of his pocket. He sits at the small telephone desk. 
MORTIMER What am I doing with tickets ? He throws the tickets on the desk. He picks up the phone, and starts dialing. 
MORTIMER Information... Hello ? Information ?... Get me the number of Judge Cullman on North Shore Road, Brooklyn. Yeah, would you call me back ? 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
The night has come. Elaine is walking very rapidly on the sidewalk. She passes near the taxi. The driver opens the door for her, but she keeps on walking. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Mortimer is standing by the window-seat. All the drapes are closed. He bends down. 
MORTIMER How it would be marvelous if he wasn't there. 
He slowly opens the lid of the seat. When the lid is a few inches open, he peeks inside. 
ELAINE (voice over) Hey, you ! 
When he hears Elaine's voice, Mortimer slams the lid down and sit on the seat. 
ELAINE Thought you were tall, dark streak of light. 
She is standing by the half-open door, and she makes the gestures Mortimer made when he had told her the same sentence, earlier in the churchyard. 
MORTIMER What are you doing here? 
Gibbs shows his newspaper to Elaine 
GIBBS I read an ad here about a room to rent. ELAINE Oh ! Shut up ! 
She walks away, leaving Gibbs at the door. She walks quickly by the taxi. The driver opens the door for her, but she walks on with quick steps. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Mortimer is still on the phone. 
MORTIMER Well, I thought that if you sign the papers, I can get Teddy to commit himself, and get him in Happy Dale... Yes, it's a wonderful place, Judge... You will ?... Fine ! I'll be over right as soon as I've made another call. 
The front door bell rings. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Gibbs is standing by the door, ringing the bell. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Abby comes in the room from the kitchen. Mortimer is still on the phone. 
ABBY Doorbell's ringing, dear. 
She crosses the room to the front door. She opens the door, revealing Gibbs. 
ABBY Oh, how do you do ? Come in. The kitchen door has remained open, and we see Martha still working on her cooking. 
GIBBS (voice over) I understand you've got a room to rent. 
Hearing that, Martha drops her cooking and comes into the room. 
ABBY Yes... Do step in. 
Abby opens the door wide for him to get in. 
GIBBS Well, are you the lady of the house ? 
ABBY Yes, I'm Miss Brewster. 
MORTIMER (voice over) Yeah, operator ? Give me long distance, please. 
Martha has joined her sister. 
ABBY And this is my sister. Another Miss Brewster. 
Gibbs takes off his hat. 
GIBBS My name's Gibbs. 
Quick shot on Mortimer, still on the phone. He gives a quick look toward his aunts, but doesn't seem interested. 
ABBY Well, do sit down. I'm sorry, but we're just setting the table for dinner. 
She moves an armchair on the other side of the table. 
ABBY Now, this would be a nice comfortable chair. 
Back to Mortimer. 
MORTIMER Oh. Hello, long distance ? I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York. 
Back to Gibbs and the sisters. 
ABBY Is Brooklyn your home ? 
GIBBS I haven't got a home. I live in a hotel. Don't like it. MARTHA A... are your family Brooklyn people ? 
MORTIMER (voice over) Hello ? Hap... 
GIBBS Haven't got any family. 
MORTIMER (voice over) Well, operator... 
ABBY All alone in the world ? 
GIBBS Yeah. 
MORTIMER (voice over) No, no... 
Abby looks at her sister with a knowing smile. 
ABBY Well, Martha.... 
MORTIMER (voice over) No, Happy Dale... Yes. 
ABBY Well, you've come to just the right house. You sit down. 
She helps him sit down in the armchair, while Martha is bringing a carafe of wine and a glass. 
MORTIMER (voice over) Dale. «D» like in «dig», you know, when you dig a lock. That's right. «A» like in «arsenic». Got that ? 
Short close-up on the carafe of wine, now on the table. 
GIBBS Is there always this much noise ? 
MARTHA Oh ! He doesn't live with us. 
Mortimer is standing, with the telephone set in one hand, and the receiver on his ear in the other hand. He whispers. 
MORTIMER I can see the headlines now. Oh, please. (back to normal voice) Hello ? Back to the table. 
GIBBS I'd really like to see the room. Well, I don't think I'll like it. 
He stands up and takes his hat, which he had put on the table. 
ABBY The room's upstairs. 
Abby is seated at the table, with Martha standing behind her. She takes the carafe. 
ABBY Won't you try a glass of our wine before we start up ? 
GIBBS Never touch it. 
MARTHA Well, we make this ourselves. It's elderberry wine. GIBBS Elderberry ? 
He puts his hat back on the table and sits down. 
GIBBS I haven't tasted elderberry wine since I was a boy. 
MORTIMER (voice over) Oh... 
MORTIMER Don't do anything. I mean, don't do anything ! Don't let anyone in the house and leave Mr. Whosit right where he is. Oh ! Get off that thing. I can't talk to you... I can't concentrate. 
He makes them stand up from the window-seat. 
MORTIMER Now, look, darlings, I wouldn't want anything in the world to happen to either of you. 
ABBY But, what on earth could happen to us? 
MORTIMER Well, darling... Anyway, you'll do that little thing for me, won't you ? All right. Abby nods. 
MORTIMER Where's my hat ? There it is. 
He leaves them to pick up his hat. 
MARTHA But, Mortimer. 
MORTIMER (voice over) What, darling, what ? 
MARTHA We were planning to hold services before dinner. 
MORTIMER Look, couldn't that wait until I get back ? 
ABBY Oh, and you could join us in the hymns ! 
MORTIMER Yes, darling, I could join you in the hymns. I'll sing with you, I'll dance with you, I'll do anything. But... remember, don't let anybody in the house until I get back. You promise ? 
Abby and Martha nod. 
MORTIMER Good. 
He puts the hat on his head. The hat is ostensibly to large for him. He opens the front door 
ABBY (voice over) Mortimer ! 
He was almost out, but he turns around. 
MORTIMER What ? 
Abby points to the hat, but can't talk. 
ABBY Uh-uh-uh-uh !... 
MORTIMER Stop that «uh-uh-uh». What is it ? 
ABBY Mr. Hoskins' hat ! 
Mortimer raises his eyes, and tears the had off his head 
MORTIMER Ohhhh !... 
He throws the hat away, leaves and closes the door. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
The cab driver is pacing back and forth on the sidewalk near his taxi. 
Mortimer comes running out of the house. The driver goes toward him. 
CAB DRIVER Do you still want me to wait here ? 
MORTIMER Yes ! Call me a cab ! 
CAB DRIVER Yeah. Okay, okay ! 
They run together and stop in front of the parked taxi. The driver waves his arm. 
CAB DRIVER Hey, cab !... Here you are. 
Another taxi stops near the first one. The driver wants to open the back door for Mortimer. 
MORTIMER Don't open it. I'll sit with you ! 
CAB DRIVER Yeah, that's right. I can go faster that way. Sure. 
Mortimer climbs in the front of the taxi, next to the driver. The taxi drives away, and the first driver remains on the street, touching his cap. 
CAB DRIVER Wait a minute ! What am I doing ? Hey ! 
He pats his own taxi, points his finger to it and waves for the other taxi to come back. 
CAB DRIVER Come here ! 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Abby picks up Mr. Hoskins' hat. She brushes it with her hand and gives it to Martha. 
ABBY Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat all mussed up. 
MARTHA Shame ! Such a nice hat. She crosses the room and, takes a brush on a cupboard near the window-seat, and starts brushing the hat. 
MARTHA You know, Abby, Mortimer didn't seem to be quite himself today. 
Abby brings two candlesticks on the table 
ABBY No. Oh, well. 
Martha opens the cupboard, which is full of man's hats. She puts Hoskins' hat with the others, and then closes the cupboard 
MARTHA Well, what were you saying about Mortimer ? 
Abby has lit the candles. 
ABBY Oh, I think I understand why he seemed so upset. 
MARTHA Why ? 
ABBY He's just been married. I believe that always makes a man a little nervous. 
MARTHA Oh, yes. The poor dears. 
She crosses the room to the door to switch off the lights 
MARTHA I'm so happy for Elaine. Oh, Abby ! If Mortimer's coming back for the services for Mr. Hoskins, we're going to need another hymnal. There's one up in my room. 
Knocks at the front door. Through the frosted window-panels of the door, we see the shadows of two men. 
ABBY Oh, I'll go, dear. 
MARTHA Abby, we promised Mortimer we wouldn't let anyone come in. 
More knocks at the door. Martha peeks through the drapes of a convenient window, a few steps above floor-level on the staircase. 
JONATHAN We come to him for help and he tries to shake us down. Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff. That's your work, doctor. You did that to me. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN No, please, Johnny, take it easy. We'll find some place and I'll fix you up right away. 
JONATHAN Tonight. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first. 
The two sisters are peeking in the room through a small rectangular hole in the door of the kitchen. JONATHAN This time, I want the face of an absolute nonentity. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes, Johnny. I know exactly what I'm going to do. 
He comes close to Jonathan and shows him on his face what he is going to do to it. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN You see, I'm going to take this piece here and lift it up... 
JONATHAN Be careful about the stitches this time. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN You leave that up to me. I'll give you nice little ears and... 
JONATHAN You were careless last time. DOCTOR EINSTEIN And new stitches. And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt. That's my specialty. You see, I take it together like this... 
JONATHAN Leave the eyes alone. Leave the nose alone. 
The scene dissolves to : 
JUDGE CULLMAN'S OFFICE - INTERIOR DAY. 
The judge is sitting, studying some papers. Mortimer is standing at his side. 
JUDGE CULLMAN Poor Teddy. I imagine it's for the best. 
He drops the papers on the desk and starts declaiming. 
JUDGE CULLMAN Well... «Ours not to reason why, ours but to do...» 
Mortimer is very irritated by the Judge's erratic attitude. He puts a pen in his hand. 
MORTIMER Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me. Right there. 
JUDGE CULLMAN Sometimes I think, with the world in its present chaotic state... 
Mortimer takes the pen from the Judge's hand and starts signing the papers. 
MORTIMER Yes, I know, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale. I sign here as next of kin, don't I ? 
JUDGE CULLMAN Only last week I created a mild sensation at the Bar Association, when I said... 
Mortimer dries the document, and shakes the Judge's hand. 
MORTIMER Yes. Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you. 
He walks to the door of the office. 
JUDGE CULLMAN Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over this week. I've been feeling rather lonely. 
Mortimer comes back on his steps. 
MORTIMER No ! No ! Oh no ! Never tell them you've been lonely. Never ! JUDGE CULLMAN Why, I... I... I... 
Mortimer comes back to the Judge's desk. 
MORTIMER Judge ! Tell me, are you a drinking man ? 
JUDGE CULLMAN Why, no. I never indulge. 
MORTIMER Good ! Then you'll live longer. 
He goes back to the door. 
JUDGE CULLMAN Of course a little wine now... 
MORTIMER No ! No ! For heaven's sake, no wine ! No wine ! 
He goes out, slamming the door behind him. The Judge looks pensively at the door Mortimer just closed. 
JUDGE CULLMAN I may be committing the wrong Brewster. 
The scene dissolves to : 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
The Brewster sister are sitting at the table with Doctor Einstein and Jonathan. The dinner is finished, and both men are smoking. 
ABBY Well, I'm sure you both want to get to wherever you're going. 
The two sisters stands up from the table. 
JONATHAN My dear, sweet aunties, I'm so full of your delicious dinner I'm unable to move a muscle. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes, it's nice here. 
Teddy comes out of his room on the balcony. He is still wearing his colonial costume. He has a book in his hand and a spare pith helmet under his arm. He rushes down the stairs. 
TEDDY I found it ! I found it ! 
He stops suddenly in the staircase. 
TEDDY Gentlemen, be seated. Jonathan and Einstein pretend they are standing up, but they immediately sit back in their chairs. 
Teddy comes down the last steps and goes toward the table. 
TEDDY Here it is, gentlemen. The story of my life, my biography. 
He puts the book on the table, in front of Einstein. It's open on a page with a picture. 
TEDDY Here's the picture I was telling you about, General. Here we are, both of us. President Roosevelt and General Goethals at Culebra Cut. That's me, General, and that's you. 
Einstein looks at the picture. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN My, how I've changed ! 
TEDDY Well, you see, that picture hasn't been taken yet. We haven't even started work on Culebra Cut. We're still digging locks. And now, General, we will both go to Panama and inspect the new lock. 
He gives the spare helmet to Einstein. 
ABBY No, Teddy. Not to Panama. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Oh, maybe some other time, Mister President. Panama is a long ways off. TEDDY Nonsense ! It's just down in the cellar. 
Jonathan, who hadn't seemed to be much interested by Teddy's conversation, suddenly looks up. 
Teddy stops a few steps from floor level. 
TEDDY Oh, that's my daughter, Alice. 
ELAINE Oh, no, Teddy ! Teddy ! 
TEDDY Now, Alice, don't be a tomboy. Don't play rough with the gentlemen. He pulls out his imaginary sword and rushes up the stairs. 
TEDDY Charge ! 
He rushes into his room and slams the door. 
ELAINE Teddy ! 
Elaine starts screaming. Jonathan holds a handkerchief over her mouth. Einstein runs to the front door and switches the lights off. 
JONATHAN Doctor, the cellar. 
ELAINE Let go of me ! Let go of me ! 
The cellar door is opened, and we see the shadows of the two men dragging Elaine down to the cellar. MARTHA What's the matter ? What's happening down there ? 
The lights are switched back on, and we see Abby and Martha on the balcony, just coming out of their room. They are both dressed in black funeral clothes. 
ABBY What's the matter ? What are you doing there ? 
Jonathan is coming alone out of the cellar. 
JONATHAN We caught a burglar, a sneak thief. Go back to your room. 
ABBY We'll call the police. 
She starts going down the stairs, followed by Martha. 
JONATHAN I'll handle this. Go back to your room. 
Abby stops at the top of the stairs. 
JONATHAN Do you hear me ? 
Knocking on the door, followed by the doorbell. The two sisters starts going down the stairs. 
JONATHAN Don't answer that. 
Another doorbell. The two sisters are running downstairs. 
JONATHAN Don't answer that ! 
Elaine rushes through the cellar door, screaming. She runs into Martha's arms, followed by Einstein. 
ELAINE Let go of me ! 
More knocking and ringing at the door. Abby goes and opens the door. Mortimer enters the house.. 
MORTIMER Where's Teddy ? Is he upstairs ? 
Elaine rushes to Mortimer and holds him by the neck. He gets rid of her. 
MORTIMER Never mind that now, darling, please. 
He starts climbing the stairs and looks, surprised, at Martha. MORTIMER What are you doing with your best clothes on ? 
He suddenly notices Jonathan's presence and stops mounting the stairs. 
MORTIMER Holy... What's that ? What's that thing there that looks like a cigar-store dummy ? 
ABBY It's your brother Jonathan, and this is Doctor Einstein. 
MORTIMER Aunt Abby, didn't I tell you not to let anybody in the house ? Who did you say it was ? 
ABBY It's your brother, Jonathan ! 
Elaine grabs Mortimer's coat, and starts talking to him. So do Abby and Martha on either side of him. Since the three of them are talking together, it is impossible to understand what they say. 
JONATHAN I've come back home, Mortimer. 
At the voice of Jonathan, the three women stop talking 
MORTIMER What ? 
JONATHAN I've come back home, Mortimer. 
MORTIMER «I've come back home, Mortimer.» Listen, it talks ! JONATHAN Yes, I talk. Mortimer, have you forgotten the things I used to do to you when you were tied to the bedpost ? The needles under your fingernails. 
Elaine grabs Mortimer's coat. 
ELAINE Mortimer, he... 
MORTIMER Wait a minute. 
Mortimer walks closer to Jonathan. 
MORTIMER Holy mackerel ! It is Jonathan ! 
JONATHAN I'm glad you remember, Mortimer. 
MORTIMER Yeah, I remember. How could I forget you ? Where'd you get that face ? Hollywood ? 
Jonathan is ready to fight with his brother. Einstein grabs his arm to stop him and Abby comes between them. 
ABBY Oh, don't you two boys start quarreling again the minute you've seen each other. 
MARTHA We invited Jonathan and Doctor Einstein to stay. 
MORTIMER What ? 
MARTHA Just for tonight. 
MORTIMER Oh no, you don't, I'm staying here tonight. In fact, I'm staying here from now on. 
Elaine taps on Mortimer's arm. 
ELAINE Mortimer, what about me ? 
MORTIMER There's no room for anybody else in the house. (to Elaine) Please, darling, just a moment. (to Jonathan) So take that little squirt and beat it ! (to Martha) Now where's Teddy ? I've got to see him right away. Is he upstairs ? He starts climbing the stairs. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Mister Brewster ! We don't take up much room. Johnny can sleep on the sofa, and I'll sleep on the window-seat. 
MORTIMER Nothing to... 
He stops going upstairs 
He crosses the room toward Jonathan 
MORTIMER Now, listen, Jonathan, this is your last chance. I'll keep O'Hara busy in the kitchen and give you a chance to get out. All three of you : you, Doctor Einstein and Spenalzo. JONATHAN Mortimer... 
MORTIMER Now if you don't leave here in five minutes, I'll bring in Officer O'Hara, and introduce him to Mr. Spenalzo. 
He opens the lid of the window-seat. But O'Hara comes into the room and Mortimer quickly closes the lid. 
O'HARA Mister Brewster, my play takes place in... 
Mortimer moves him back to the kitchen. 
MORTIMER I'll be right with you, O'Hara. Right with you. Right with you. Just give me one moment. 
Mortimer closes the door behind O'Hara and turns toward Jonathan. 
MORTIMER Now get going ! All three of you. 
He enters the kitchen, and closes the door behind him. Einstein arrives silently behind Jonathan and taps on this shoulder. Jonathan turns quickly around. He then goes to the kitchen door and comes back to Einstein. 
JONATHAN Doctor, this affair between my brother and myself has got to be settled. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN But, Johnny, we've got trouble enough as it is. Come, let's go. 
JONATHAN We're not going. We're going to sleep right here in this house. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN What ? With a cop in the kitchen and Spenalzo in the window-seat ? 
JONATHAN That's all he's got on us. We'll take Spenalzo and dump him in the bay. After that, we're coming back here. Then if he tries to interfere... 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN No, no, Johnny. No, please. 
JONATHAN Doctor, we've got a wonderful setup here. We can make a fortune. Two old ladies as a front. Only Mortimer stands in our way. I never did like Mortimer. 
He goes toward the kitchen door. Einstein catches up with him. DOCTOR EINSTEIN No, Johnny, please, take it easy. Please ! 
JONATHAN Doctor, you know when I make up my mind... 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah, I know, when you make up your mind, you lose your head. Look, Johnny, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you. 
Jonathan takes Einstein's hand, twists it and brings Einstein down on the floor. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Okay, Johnny. Okay ! 
Jonathan releases Einstein's hand, who stands up to massage his hand. 
JONATHAN Take the instruments and hide them in the cellar. Move fast. Einstein takes the suitcase and walks to the cellar. Jonathan opens the lid of the window-seat. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT 
In the kitchen, the Brewster sisters are moving around the room, preparing food on the table. Both men are standing up near the table. O'Hara, without his cap on his head, has a sandwich in his hand. 
O'HARA Mister Brewster, you don't know what goes on in Brooklyn. 
MORTIMER Oh, I don't know. 
O'Hara picks up a cup on the table. 
O'HARA No. My mother was an actress. 
MORTIMER Oh ? Legitimate ? 
O'HARA Of course she was. She was my mother. 
MORTIMER Oh, excuse me. 
O'HARA Peaches La Tour was her name. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
The door to the cellar is open. Einstein rushes up from the cellar. He looks a bit frightened. DOCTOR EINSTEIN Hey, Johnny, Johnny, come quick ! 
Jonathan, who was looking down into the open window-seat, stands up. 
JONATHAN What's the matter ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN You know that hole in the cellar ? 
JONATHAN Yes. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Well, we got an ace in the hole. 
Jonathan closes the window-seat, and walks toward the cellar. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT O'Hara is explaining something to Mortimer. 
O'HARA It's no fly-by-night idea. I've been working on this thing for twelve years. 
Mortimer, who had just heard the creaking of the lid of the window-seat, turns back toward the policeman. 
MORTIMER Well, you have ? 
O'HARA Yeah. 
MORTIMER Well, rehash it in your mind. I'll be back in a minute. 
O'HARA Oh, swell. 
MORTIMER I like the first act. 
O'HARA But I didn't tell you the first act, Mister Brew... I... 
Before he can finish his sentence, Mortimer is already out of the room. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Mortimer enters the empty sitting-room. He goes to the window- seat, opens it and talks to the corpse. 
MORTIMER No, I thought I told you... He closes the lid, kneels on the seat and looks through the open window. 
MORTIMER Jonathan ! Jonathan ! Jonathan ! 
Jonathan enters from the cellar, followed by Einstein. 
JONATHAN Yes, Mortimer. 
Mortimer turns around and looks, surprised, at his brother. Then he comes into the room 
MORTIMER What are you two doing still here ? I thought I told you to beat it. 
JONATHAN We're not going. MORTIMER You're not going ? 
They stop when they see Jonathan and Einstein. 
ABBY Oh ! We thought we heard you leave. 
JONATHAN Perish the thought, dear aunties. That was just Mortimer. And speaking of services, Aunt Martha, will you make us some coffee while we take Mister Spenalzo down to the cellar ? 
MARTHA Oh, no. No, Jonathan. You've got to take him with you ! 
Jonathan opens the lid of the window-seat. 
JONATHAN There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs waiting for him. 
ABBY A friend of Mortimer's ? 
JONATHAN Take his feet, Doctor. Mister Spenalzo and he will get along fine together. They're both dead. 
The two men bend down to take the corpse out of the window-seat. 
MARTHA Oh ! He must mean Mister Hoskins. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Mister Hoskins ? 
The two men stand up and look at the sisters. Jonathan comes closer to them. 
JONATHAN You know about what's down there ? ABBY Of course we do. And he's no friend of Mortimer's. He's one of our gentlemen. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Your gentlemen ? 
MARTHA Yes. And we won't have any strangers buried in our cellar. 
JONATHAN But Mister Hoskins ? 
MARTHA Mister Hoskins is no stranger. 
ABBY Besides, there's no room for Mister Spenalzo. The cellar's crowded already. 
JONATHAN Crowded ? With what ? 
ABBY There are twelve graves down there now. 
The two men look at each other. Jonathan seems the most surprised. 
JONATHAN Twelve graves. 
ABBY That leaves very little room and we're going to need it. 
JONATHAN You mean that you and Aunt Martha have murdered twelve... ABBY Murdered ? Certainly not. It's one of our charities. 
MARTHA Why, what we've been doing is a mercy. 
ABBY So you just take your Mister Spenalzo out of here. 
They turn to Einstein, who has seated himself and is laughing his head off. 
JONATHAN You've done all that right here in this house and buried them in the cellar ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN That's wonderful, Johnny ! 
He stands up. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN We've been chased all over the world, and they stay right here in Brooklyn, and they do just as good as you do. 
JONATHAN What ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah. You got twelve, they got twelve. 
Jonathan grabs Einstein by his shirt. 
JONATHAN I've got thirteen. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN No, Johnny, twelve. Don't brag. 
JONATHAN Thirteen. 
They both starts counting on their fingers. 
JONATHAN There's Mister Spenalzo. Then the first one in London. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah. 
JONATHAN Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney, one in Melbourne, two in San Francisco, one in Phoenix, Arizona. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Phoenix ? 
JONATHAN The filling station. DOCTOR EINSTEIN Filling st... Oh, yes. 
He mimes the gesture of one having his throat cut. 
JONATHAN Three in Chicago and one in South Bend. That makes thirteen. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN You cannot count the one in South Bend. He died of pneumonia. 
JONATHAN He wouldn't have died of pneumonia if I hadn't shot him. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN No, no, Johnny, you cannot count him. You got twelve, they got twelve. The old ladies is just as good as you are. 
Both sisters seem very happy by Einstein's statement. They smile. DOCTOR EINSTEIN They are, are they ? That's easily taken care of. All I need is one more. That's all. Just one more. And I've a pretty good idea who it is. 
He looks menacingly at his two aunts, who do not smile anymore. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Mortimer is walking along the gate of the churchyard, dragging Dr. Gilchrist with him. Gilchrist is trying to tie his necktie while walking. Apparently, Mortimer didn't let him dress completely when he took him out of his home. 
MORTIMER I'm a very lucky man to have caught you at home, Doctor Gilchrist. 
DOCTOR GILCHRIST This is most irregular, most irregular. 
MORTIMER I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed, but, you see, you're the only one who can help me. 
DOCTOR GILCHRIST I know Teddy blows bugles, but I can't commit a man to an institution just on that. 
MORTIMER Oh, well, if only you had a little talk with him, I assure you you'd be convinced by him. Here's the house I... 
They stop walking when they hear hymns sung by the Brewster sisters. 
MORTIMER There goes Hoskins. DOCTOR GILCHRIST Who ? 
Mortimer looks embarrassed : he doesn't want to explain to the doctor who Hoskins is. 
MORTIMER What ? What ? Did I say... Oh, I... 
Elaine bends out of her window to hug Mortimer. 
ELAINE Darling, that's ancient history. 
Medium shot on the doctor and Teddy walking arm in arm among the tombstones. 
TEDDY Yes, Doctor, I'll run for a third term, but I won't be elected. And that'll mean the last of the Roosevelts in the White House. 
DOCTOR GILCHRIST That's what you think. 
TEDDY Of course, if the country insists... 
Back to Elaine's room window. The young couple is still talking on either side of the window. 
ELAINE Oh, darling, all this doesn't prove a thing. Look at your aunts. They're Brewsters, aren't they ? They're the sweetest, sanest people I've ever known. 
MORTIMER Yeah. 
He turns around to listen to his aunts singing their hymns. 
MORTIMER Well, even they have their peculiarities. 
ELAINE What of it ? So your family's crazy. So you're crazy. That's the way I want you, the way I love you. I'm crazy too, but kiss me. 
MORTIMER No, no. I... Ohhh ! 
Mortimer hesitates a little and then gives a passionate kiss to Elaine. 
Back to Teddy and the doctor. Teddy is vigorously shaking the doctor's hand. 
DOCTOR GILCHRIST Goodbye, Ambassador. I've enjoyed this little talk very much. Anytime you're in Washington, drop in to see me at the White House. 
He walks away, leaving the doctor very shaken by the experience. The doctor runs to Mortimer, still outside Elaine's window and kissing her passionately. The doctor clears loudly his throat to attract Mortimer's attention. 
DOCTOR GILCHRIST Those papers. Those papers. 
MORTIMER Go away. 
Mortimer suddenly realizes what the doctor is talking about. 
MORTIMER Oh, papers ! Papers ! Yes. 
He pulls the papers from his jacket pocket, and gives them to the doctor. 
DOCTOR GILCHRIST I'll enjoy committing him to any place. 
MORTIMER You will ? 
DOCTOR GILCHRIST I've just been appointed Ambassador to Bolivia ! 
MORTIMER Ah, you see ? Didn't I tell you ? 
Elaine suddenly slams her window down... on Mortimer's fingers ! Mortimer yells because of the pain. The doctor looks up from the papers. Elaine also shut the inside shade down, shutting the room completely from the outside world. 
MORTIMER No. Don't worry about that. Just go on signing the papers. Oh dear. Thank you. 
Mortimer blows on his hurt fingers, then grabs the papers from the doctor and runs away. 
MORTIMER Okay, thank you. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close-up on the empty window-seat, where just remains Mr. Spenalzo's hat. 
From the open cellar door, Martha is coming out, followed by Abby. They are still dressed in their funeral clothes. 
ABBY All right ! All right ! We'll find out whose house this is ! I'm warning you, you better stop it. There's no use doing what you're doing, because it'll just have to be undone. 
JONATHAN (voice over from the cellar) Aunt Abby, go to bed ! 
ABBY It's a terrible thing to do to bury a good Methodist with a foreigner. 
Mortimer comes rushing into the room with the papers in his hand. 
MORTIMER Hello. 
He blows on the papers to dry the ink of the signature. 
ABBY Mortimer, where have you been ? 
Mortimer starts running upstairs. 
MORTIMER Uh-uh ? Oh, I was getting some papers signed. Is Teddy in his room ? 
MARTHA Oh, Mortimer, what is the matter with you ? Running around getting papers signed at a time like this. 
ABBY Martha and I are going for the police. 
MORTIMER Police ! He quickly get back downstairs 
MORTIMER Oh-oh-oh ! Wait-wait-wait ! You can't go for the police. 
MARTHA Oh, no ? You know what Jonathan's doing ? 
ABBY He's putting Mister Hoskins and Mister Spenalzo in together. 
MORTIMER Oh, darling, let him. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - CELLAR - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Einstein just finished working, and he is cleaning the bottom of his pants. We notice he is wearing Mr. Spenalzo's shoes. A shovel is resting on the wall near him. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN This is all fixed up nice now. Nice and smooth like a lake. The President will be very proud of his Panama Canal. 
He stretches himself 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Oh, Johnny, bed feels good already. You know, we didn't get any sleep for forty-eight hours. 
Jonathan walks behind him, carrying a shovel. He puts the shovel down against the wall and start mounting the stairs 
JONATHAN You're forgetting, Doctor. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN What ? 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Mortimer is trying to calm his aunts down 
ABBY Now, look. If Jonathan and Mister Spenalzo aren't out this house before morning, we're going for the police. 
MORTIMER Yeah, but I'll get them out, I promise you that ! 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN You get out of here ! Look, look, when Johnny's in that mood, he's a madman. He's a maniac ! And then things happen. Horrible things. 
He mimes the cutting of his own throat, and takes Mortimer's hand to throw him out. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN You get out of here ! 
MORTIMER Will you stop it ? Now look, stop telling me about Jonathan, I'll take care of Jonathan, and you take care of yourself. Now, get going, little fellow. 
He opens the door to throw him out. He pats him on the behind to move him, and discover the shape of the bottle under his hand. 
MORTIMER What's that ? What's that ? Wait a minute. 
He takes the bottle out of Einstein's pocket 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Oh no ! My schnapps ! 
MORTIMER I could use that. I could use that. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN That's mine. 
He tries to get his bottle back, but Mortimer holds on it. 
MORTIMER Please. Only for dramatic critics. Now look, you beat it before things start popping around here. 
He moves away to the table, with the bottle in his hand. Einstein joins his hand in a praying gesture. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN But, look, Mr. Brewster, please. You've just been married. You have a nice little wife waiting for you. Please go now. Please. 
Mortimer pours some of the schnapps in a glass. 
Einstein slams the front door with a very nervous punch, and walks toward Mortimer. He mumbles incomprehensible words, probably in German. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Tell me, don't those plays you see all the time teach you anything ? 
Mortimer is drinking. He lowers his glass. 
MORTIMER Oh, stop it, don't get me on the subject of plays ! I've got a lot on my mind now. I've got to wait here for Mister Witherspoon. 
He looks at his watch. DOCTOR EINSTEIN At least people in plays act like they got sense. 
MORTIMER Oh, you think so ? Did you ever see anybody in a play ever act like they got intelligence ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN How can somebody be so stupid ? 
MORTIMER You ought to have my job a few nights. Listen to me, brother. When you get out of prison, you have yourself wheeled over to the Garrick Theater. Oh ! Oh ! There's a play there that's been running so bad that it'll still be running when you get out. Now, in this, there's a man... Now listen to this... 
Behind Mortimer, the cellar door opens silently and Jonathan enters slowly into the room, without Mortimer noticing him. 
MORTIMER Now, he knows he's in the house with murderers. So he ought to know he's in danger. He's even been warned to get out of the house. And does he go ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes. 
MORTIMER No, he doesn't. He stays ! This fellow doesn't even have sense to be scared or to be on his guard. No, no. The murderer even invites him to sit down. What do you think he does ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Well, I don't know. MORTIMER He sits down ! I remember what he did. He deliberately pulls up a chair like that and he sits down in it. 
Mortimer goes to a wooden armchair and sits down in it. He puts his glass on the table. 
MORTIMER Isn't that great ? So there he is, all waiting to be trussed up and gagged. What do you think they used to truss him up with ? 
He keeps on laughing while talking. 
Close-up of Jonathan's face, smiling. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN (voice over) Oh, what ? 
MORTIMER (voice over) The curtain cord. 
Jonathan looks in the direction of the window... and the curtain cord. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Curtain cord ? But didn't he see him get it ? 
Behind the seated Mortimer, Jonathan is silently walking to the window. 
MORTIMER Seen him get it. No. The silly chump sits down with his back toward the murderer. 
Mortimer turns slightly on his chair, but without taking his eyes off Einstein, and, of course, without looking at his brother behind him, quietly cutting the curtain cords with a jack-knife. 
MORTIMER All he has to do is look around, but does he ? No ! 
Medium shot on Jonathan cutting the curtain cords. 
MORTIMER (voice over) No... Look, you see, brother Heidelberg, in a play or even in a movie, for that matter, ...a fellow never sees or hears anything. No. That's right. 
Jonathan folds the jack-knife and puts it in his pocket. He prepares the cords he has just cut. Einstein takes a napkin on the table. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN But what does he do ? 
MORTIMER Oh, what does he do ? Well, the big chump sits there. This fellow's supposed to be bright. He sits there. 
Jonathan is now just behind Mortimer's chair, with the cord ready in his hands. 
MORTIMER Now get a load of this. Look, look at the attitude. Large as life ! He sits there waiting to be tied up and gagged. The big dope ! 
He bursts out laughing... But only for two seconds, because Jonathan ties up his arm to the armchair from behind, and Einstein shoves the napkin in his open mouth. Einstein then helps Jonathan to tie Mortimer's legs to the legs of the armchair. Then, with the help of a knife, he puts all the napkin in Mortimer's mouth. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN You were right about that fellow. He wasn't very bright. 
Fade out, and then fade in on the same scene a few moments later. The lights have been dimmed. Mortimer is completely tied on the chair, and the gag is tied around his head. 
JONATHAN Yes, Mortimer. I've been away for twenty years. But never, my dear brother, were you out of my mind. 
Jonathan is lighting candles on the table. 
JONATHAN In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you. 
He opens his instruments case. We see the surgery instruments shining in the candles light. 
Close-up on Mortimer's very frightened face. 
Einstein sits down near the table. He seems depressed at the sight of his surgery instruments. 
Jonathan takes a small phial from the inside pocket of his jacket, opens it, smells it and closes it, and puts it back in his pocket. 
JONATHAN The more you struggle, Mortimer, the more you strangle yourself. Later on, you may consider that a blessing. 
He takes a curved forceps from the case and plays with it. 
Close-up on Mortimer's frightened face. 
Einstein wipes his face with a napkin. 
O'HARA All of a sudden, a fire breaks out. What an effect ! The firemen rush in and who do you think is leading them ? Mayor Fiorello La Guardia ! 
O'Hara turns around and sees Jonathan lying on the last steps of the stairs. 
O'HARA What's the matter with him ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah, probably your play put him to sleep. 
O'HARA What ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN I personally, I like it very much. 
O'HARA It's probably over his head, huh ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yeah. O'Hara looks at Jonathan's face. 
O'HARA Where have I seen that face before ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN No, please. 
He kneels beside Jonathan's body, and O'Hara returns to Mortimer. 
O'HARA Well, the scene changes. It's an evolving stage. I'm walking along my beat, well, like that, casual-like, when a guy that I'm following, it turns out he's really following me ! 
Knocks at the door. O'Hara turns to Einstein. 
O'HARA (to Einstein) Don't let nobody in. (to Mortimer) I figure I'll outsmart him. There's a vacant house on the corner. 
Einstein peeks through the drapes to have a look at the outside of the front door. He rushes to Jonathan. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Hey, Johnny, the cops ! 
Einstein tries to wake up Jonathan, but doesn't succeed. He picks up his shoe and rushes upstairs. 
O'HARA So, I ducks in there. I sees the door handle turn, so I pulls out my gun, braces myself against the wall and I says : «Come in !» 
He takes out his gun and points it at the door. Brophy and another cop, officer Saunders, come in. When they see O'Hara's gun pointing at them, they raise their arms. O'Hara puts his gun back in his holster and welcomes his colleagues. 
O'HARA Oh, hello, boys. 
BROPHY What the Sam Hill's going on here ? 
O'HARA Hello Sarge, what do you think, this is Mortimer Brewster. He's going to help me write my play. 
SAUNDERS Do you have to tie him up to make him listen ? 
He starts to untie Mortimer. BROPHY O'Hara, you better report in the station. Why didn't you ring in ? You got the whole force out looking for you. 
O'HARA Right in the middle of the second act. Did they send you guys here looking for me ? 
Brophy goes to the telephone and starts dialing. 
BROPHY No, we came to warn the old ladies. There is a difficulty. The colonel blew that bugle again. 
O'HARA Yeah, I heard him. 
BROPHY The neighbors are all phoning in. The Lieutenant's on the warpath. He says we've got to put him away someplace. 
He sees Jonathan lying on the steps. BROPHY Now, who the heck is this ? 
O'HARA Oh, that's Mister Brewster's brother. My play put him to sleep. 
BROPHY Oh ! That's the one that ran away. So he came back. (in the phone) Brophy. Get me Mac. (to O'Hara) Haven't you got yourself in a mess ! You're two hours overdue at the station. I better let them know that I found you. 
O'Hara bends on Jonathan and shakes him 
O'HARA Hey ! It wasn't that bad, was it ? 
BROPHY (in the phone) Mac ? Tell the Lieutenant he can call off the big manhunt. We found him... At the Brewster house... Shall we bring him in ?... All right, we'll hold him right here. 
He puts the phone down and turns to O'Hara, who has succeeded in waking up Jonathan and getting him on his feet. Jonathan stares at Brophy. He thinks Brophy is talking about him. 
Mortimer looks at his left hand, which has just been freed by Saunders. 
BROPHY The Lieutenant is on his way over. JONATHAN So I've been turned in, hey ? All right, you've got me. I suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother will split the reward. 
Brophy and O'Hara each take one arm of Jonathan. 
BROPHY & O'HARA Reward ? 
JONATHAN Yes, reward ! Now I'll do some turning in ! 
Mortimer, who had his hand and legs untied by Saunders but is still gagged and has his chest still tied on the armchair, moans and moves excitedly on his seat. 
O'HARA (to Jonathan) Oh, wait a minute, Mr. Brewster. 
JONATHAN You think my aunts are sweet, charming old ladies, don't you ? Well, there's thirteen bodies buried in the cellar ! Yes, thirteen. 
Mortimer jumps on his chair and try to scream through his gag. Since he cannot succeed to get off the chair, he stands up, still gagged and tied to the back of the chair and rushes to Brophy, carrying the armchair with him. 
BROPHY Be careful what you say about your aunts, they happen to be friends of ours. 
JONATHAN I'll show them to you. 
BROPHY Don't you make any trouble for them, do you hear me ! 
Mortimer walks between Brophy and Jonathan, and tries to say something to Brophy through his gag. Saunders, behind Mortimer, keeps on untying him. 
BROPHY (to Mortimer) Never mind, Mr. Brewster. Leave him to me, I'll take care of him. 
JONATHAN (to O'Hara) You come down to the cellar. 
O'HARA (to Jonathan) Now, wait a minute. 
Mortimer is still trying to talk through his gag to O'Hara and Brophy, and moves excitedly around the two cops. He moves so much that Saunders has stopped trying to untie him. 
JONATHAN Thirteen bodies. I'll show you where they're buried. 
O'HARA Oh, yeah ! 
BROPHY Go down to the cellar with him, O'Hara. 
JONATHAN Yes, come to the cellar. 
He grabs O'Hara's hand and drags him to the cellar door. 
O'HARA Well, look, do I have to ? 
Mortimer, still gagged, and still carrying his armchair like a backpack, tries to follow them, but Saunders moves him away. Mortimer runs round the table to try again to join the party going down to the cellar, with Saunders running behind him. 
O'HARA Sorry, maybe I don't want to go down to the cellar with him. 
Rooney comes toward them with the documents in his hand. 
MORTIMER Captain, this is Mister Witherspoon. Witherspoon looks at Rooney with a smile. 
WITHERSPOON Oh, yes, yes, he'll be very happy at Happy Dale. Come, my boy. 
Witherspoon takes Rooney's arm. Rooney pushes him away. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY What is this? 
MORTIMER No, no, no-no, Mister Witherspoon, you got it wrong. This is... this is Captain Rooney. 
WITHERSPOON The police ?... Oh ! 
The two men shake hands, and Rooney gives the papers to Witherspoon. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed. Now you can take him away, Super. 
Teddy joins them. 
TEDDY I'll be in my office vetoing some bills. 
MORTIMER Mister President, I have good news for you. Your term of office is over. 
TEDDY Is this March the four ? MORTIMER Practically. 
TEDDY Let's see... Oh ! Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa ! Well, I must get started immediately. 
Teddy starts walking away, but he stops suddenly and gives Witherspoon a suspicious look. 
TEDDY Is he trying to move into the White House before I've moved out ? 
MORTIMER Who, Mister President ? 
Teddy looks at Witherspoon with a disgusted face. 
TEDDY Taft ! MORTIMER No, no, Teddy this isn't Mister Taft. It's Mister Witherspoon, he's going to be your guide to Africa. 
Teddy shakes hands with Witherspoon. 
TEDDY Bully ! Bully ! Wait right here. I'll bring down my equipment. 
Witherspoon looks at Teddy walking away with a sweet smile. 
WITHERSPOON Happy man. 
Teddy starts going upstairs and he meets Abby and Martha coming down. They're dressed back in their usual clothes. Teddy shakes hands with them. 
TEDDY Goodbye, Aunt Abby, goodbye Aunt Martha. I'm on my way to Africa. Isn't it wonderful ? 
For the last time, Teddy takes out his imaginary sword, points it forward and rushes upstairs. 
TEDDY Charge ! 
He gets into his room and slams the door behind him. Witherspoon looks a bit surprised, and Mortimer holds the hands of the grandfather clock. Abby joins him 
MORTIMER It's all right, Aunt Abby, I've got it. 
Witherspoon looks at the scene with slightly anxious eyes. WITHERSPOON Oh, dear. And Happy Dale is full of staircases. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Elaine walks across the churchyard toward the Brewster's house. She is wearing a coat over her nightdress. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Abby and Martha are talking with Witherspoon. 
MARTHA You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you ? 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY (voice over) No, he's come to take him. Teddy's been blowing his bugle again. 
Both sisters turn toward Rooney. ABBY Oh, no-no, no, he can't go now ! We won't permit it. 
MARTHA We promise to take his bugle away from him. We won't be separated from Teddy. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY I'm sorry. 
ABBY Mortimer, how can you allow this ? You promised. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY Mister Brewster's got nothing to do with this, see. The law is the law ! Teddy's committed himself and he's got to go. 
ABBY Well, if he's going, we're going, too ! 
MARTHA Yes, you'll have to take us with him. 
Mortimer smiles broadly. 
MORTIMER Why-why... why not ? Why not, indeed ? 
WITHERSPOON Oh well now, indeed, it's sweet of them to want to go, but it's quite impossible. We never take sane people at Happy Dale. 
Mortimer comes very close to Witherspoon, and tries, by mime only, to induce Witherspoon to take his aunts. 
WITHERSPOON Oh, no-no-no-no... MORTIMER (whispering) Now, these two little sane people, mixed up with all the others, will get lost in the shuffle. You could arrange that. 
WITHERSPOON Oh, no-no-no-no... 
MORTIMER Just put them in and they'll get all mixed up. 
WITHERSPOON Oh, no ! No, no ! No ! Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy. 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Elaine has now reached the Brewster house and opens a window. We hear Lieutenant Rooney's voice. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY (voice over) Now, let's be sensible, ladies... 
BREWSTER RESIDENCE - SITTING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Rooney is talking to the Brewster sisters. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY ...Here I am wasting my time when I could be doing some serious work. You know, ladies, there are still murders to be solved in Brooklyn. It ain't only his bugle blowing, and neighbors being afraid of him. But things are going to get worse. We're liable to have to dig up your cellar. 
ABBY Our cellar ? 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY Yeah. 
Mortimer seems a bit worried. 
MORTIMER Oh-oh ! 
ABBY (voice over) Right here ? 
WITHERSPOON (voice over) Yes, please. It's on the right-hand side right there. 
Martha and Abby are seated at the table, signing the papers. Witherspoon and Mortimer, standing besides them, are helping them. 
ABBY I'm really looking forward to going. The neighborhood here has changed so. 
MARTHA Yes. Especially since they won that old pennant thing. 
WITHERSPOON Oh... oh, dear, I'm so sorry. We've overlooked something. It's absolutely compulsory that we have the signature of a physician. 
Einstein has reached the bottom of the stairs and he is sneaking out through the front door. 
MORTIMER A doctor... Oh ! Doctor Einstein ! Come here and sign some papers, please. 
Einstein turns around. 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Good night. 
MORTIMER Come here, Doctor Einstein. 
WITHERSPOON A doctor ? 
MORTIMER Oh, yes, yes. Doctor Einstein almost operated on me earlier this evening. Come on, Doctor. 
Einstein drops his suitcase by the front door, and comes to the table. 
MORTIMER Here. Just sign right here, please, Doctor. Einstein signs the paper Mortimer gives him. Meanwhile, Rooney and Saunders are coming out of the kitchen and crossing the room. 
ABBY Were you leaving, Doctor ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN Yes, please. 
MARTHA Oh ! Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan ? 
DOCTOR EINSTEIN I don't think we go to the same place. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY (speaking on the telephone) Hello, Mac. We picked up that guy that's wanted in Indiana. His accomplice's description is one on the circular, on the desk. Read it to me, will you ? 
Einstein leaves the table, and almost bumps into Saunders, who is brushing his uniform. He listen to the description of himself that Rooney is repeating from his colleague at the police station. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY (still on the phone) Yeah... About forty... Five-foot-three... One hundred and forty pounds... Pop eyes... Talks with a German accent... Poses as a doctor... Okay, Mac. Thanks. 
He puts the phone back on its hook. 
Witherspoon slaps Einstein on the back, and Einstein starts raising his arms. 
WITHERSPOON It's all right, Lieutenant Rooney. The doctor here has completed the signatures. 
LIEUTENANT ROONEY Oh, that's great ! Thanks, Doc. You've done Brooklyn a great service. 
He shakes Einstein's hand and slaps his back. Einstein cannot believe his luck. He smiles and rushes to the door. 
ABBY But Dr. Einstein ! 
Einstein picks up his suitcase, and rushes out of the door, and closes it behind him. 
WITHERSPOON (to Mortimer) Now, Mister Witherspoon... 
MORTIMER No, no, you're Mister Witherspoon, I'm Mister Brewster. WITHERSPOON (laughing) It's contagious, yes. It's your turn. 
MORTIMER Now, don't play games... 
WITHERSPOON You sign. You sign as next of kin. 
MORTIMER Oh, next of kin. Why didn't you say so ? I'm all confused. Don't mind me. 
Teddy appears on the balcony, all dressed up in his colonial costume, but without the helmet. 
TEDDY Mr. Witherport. 
WITHERSPOON Spoon. Mortimer picks up a spoon on the table and gives it to Witherspoon. 
MORTIMER Oh, here it is. 
TEDDY Come up and pack my duffel. 
WITHERSPOON Duffel ? 
MORTIMER Yes, duffel. Pack his duffel. He's President, you know ? 
WITHERSPOON Oh ! 
TEDDY And bring along my bugle. 
Witherspoon looks on the table, where the bugle is, and then at Mortimer. Mortimer makes a little agreement sign. 
MORTIMER President. 
Witherspoon picks up the bugle, and starts walking upstairs. He stops after a few steps, as if he were hesitating. 
MORTIMER Don't charge ! 
Mortimer and Witherspoon are exchanging faces. Martha and Abby are whispering into each other's ear. 
ABBY Mortimer. Mortimer, we're really very worried about something. 
MORTIMER Oh, now, darling, don't be worried. 
He kisses Abby. 
MARTHA Me too, Mortimer. 
MORTIMER Well, of course, darling. 
He kisses Martha. 
MORTIMER You'll both are going to be very happy at Happy Dale, will you. 
MARTHA Oh yes, dear, we're very happy about the whole thing, but that's just it. We don't want anything to go wrong. 
MORTIMER Well, what would go wrong ? 
ABBY Mortimer, will they investigate those signatures ? 
MORTIMER Oh, no, they won't look up Dr. Einstein... 
MARTHA But it's not his signature, dear. It's yours. 
MORTIMER Mine ?

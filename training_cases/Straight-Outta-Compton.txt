1   TITLE/CREDIT SEQUENCE:                                        1 
An AVALANCHE of SOUNDBITES, colliding and overlapping. Coming so fast, we can barely process them. A virtual sound book... 
WAR ON DRUGS. NANCY REAGAN. CRACK. DARYL GATES. CRIPS & BLOODS. Everything from KNIVES to PISTOLS to ASSAULT RIFLES. All these images add up to a minute and a half recap of not just black history but American history. As soon as they're done, we find ourselves plunged into -- 
TOTAL DARKNESS: 
FADE UP: ON; 
2   EXT. BROWN HOUSE - COMPTON - NIGHT                            2 
A bucket pulls up in front of a shitty-looking BROWN HOUSE with ugly bars on the windows and doors. A rusted swing-set leans sideways on the dirt/grass they call a front lawn. 
SUPERIMPOSE: COMPTON, CA 1986 
Inside the car is ERIC WRIGHT, 21, but you know him as -- 
SUPERIMPOSE: ERIC WRIGHT AKA EAZY-E 
A man who is completely in his element -- comfortable and poised, ready for anything. 
He hops out of the car, moves quickly to the TRUNK -- pops it open and reaches inside. With an electric screwdriver, Eazy unscrews a CERWIN-VEGA sub-woofer. Grabs a bulging BROWN BAG out of the speaker... and a 9mm -- SLAMS the trunk. 
ON THE ROOF, a LOOKOUT clocks Eazy as he walks up to the front door of the decrepit house... 
Eazy KNOCKS BY CODE. A dude, TONE (20s), opens a slat in the door. Gauges Eazy, EYES SKEPTICAL. 
TONE Who is it? 
EAZY Eric! Man, we been through this shit a thousand times. 
Multiple DEADBOLTS UNLOCK and an irritated Eazy enters -- 
EAZY (CONT'D) What's the use to having this dumb ass knock if I gotta tell you my name anyway? 
3   INT. BROWN HOUSE - MINUTES LATER                              3 
It's not what you'd call "cozy." The carpet is torn up, stained, cigarette-burnt. Walls covered in TAGS. A PITBULL stares menacingly from the kitchen. 
In addition to Eazy and Tone, there are THREE other people spread around the room: one GIRL lounges on a vinyl couch, eyes glazed; another girl, TASHA, loudly SCRAPES soul food onto the pitbull's plate; and a JITTERY DUDE steady keeps an EYE out the WINDOW, tense, occasionally clocking -- 
EAZY spreads the CONTENTS of the BROWN BAG before them on a long TABLE: three FREEZER BAGS each containing 10 ounces. He looks up, ALL BUSINESS. 
EAZY Now where the money at? 
TONE Man, you heard what happen? My best runner got cracked. They sent his young ass to Y.A. -- 
EAZY The fuck that got to do with me? 
Tone turns to Tasha in the kitchen, nods. 
TONE Tasha, get this dude a 40. 
TASHA opens the fridge, grabs a 40oz. -- 
EAZY Do I look thirsty to you? (beat) Where my ends at? 
-- hands it to Tone who CRACKS it open. Drinks... 
TONE Why you so ruthless, Eric, damn! You don't want nothin' to drink? What you want -- (re: the girls) -- you want some pussy? 
EAZY Yep. But not from these strawberry bitches you got right here. 
TONE So you just gonna disrespect my house like that, Cuz? 
EAZY Dumb ass, this a dope house! It's already disrespected. 
JITTERY DUDE (re: Eazy's drugs) Well fuck it then -- You gonna have to let us hold on to that right there. 
ON THE COUCH, the GIRL grabs a SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN FROM UNDER A PILLOW. Levels it at Eazy, face grimaced, hard, strung out. 
EAZY Yeah, do what you gotta do -- `Cause I got my homies parked across the street from your momma's house. I don't show up. They show out... 
Eazy just stares right back at them. The tension's like a pressure cooker about to burst. Until -- 
A WHISTLE echoes in from outside (THE LOOKOUT) -- 
Suddenly, everyone notices a deep RUMBLING coming from outside. Jittery Dude steps back from the window, eyes wide -- 
JITTERY DUDE Oh, shit -- 
Because there's a MASSIVE ARMORED VEHICLE rolling down the street toward them. 6 TONS of steel, with a 14-foot BATTERING RAM mounted on the front. LAPD emblazoned on the side. 
JITTERY DUDE (CONT'D) Fuckin' Batter-Ram! 
Everyone in the room FLIES into action, STASHING the WEAPONS and the MONEY into hidden STASH SPOTS all over the HOUSE: Behind fake-panel LIGHT SWITCHES, hidden HATCHES beneath the FLOORBOARDS, in a fake-panel inside the FRIDGE. It's some serious MACGYVER SHIT. 
Eazy grabs his ROCKS, BEE-LINES for the BACK of the HOUSE, eyes wide, amped on adrenaline as the RUMBLING ESCALATES to an almost UNBEARABLE LEVEL -- 
CRASH!!! The 14-foot BATTERING RAM PUNCHES THROUGH THE WALL. DEBRIS FLIES EVERYWHERE. The RAM keeps coming until -- 
The GIRLS SCREAM! The ARMORED VEHICLE REVERSES, the BATTERING RAM POLE YANKING THE ENTIRE WALL OUT WITH IT, leaving a MASSIVE RAGGED HOLE where we can see -- 
TYREE Can I come with you? 
DRE You been fightin' for your own room this whole time and now you wanna come with me? 
They share a CHUCKLE. Then -- 
TYREE You know she's just want the best for you. 
DRE I know, T. I want the best for me too -- that's way I gotta go. 
Him and Dre have special brother-to-brother embrace. Then Dre hops into his car. 
DRE (CONT'D) When I get set up right, I'mma have you come with me. Don't worry about it. It's gonna be sooner then you think. 
Tyree sullenly nods. 
Dre triggers the ignition, MUSIC BLASTING, and PEELS away -- 
DRE (CONT'D) Call you later. 
6   INT./EXT. DRE'S CAR - COMPTON - MINUTES LATER                    6 
Dre rolls along   in that ugly-ass Datsun. It's still early, but the STREETS   are starting to FILL UP. Dudes in doorways, on the corners,   clocking him as he passes. An LA SHERIFF'S DEPT. SQUAD CAR   slides past, disappears around a corner. 
WE HEAR a HELICOPTER SOUND, as WE GO WIDE -- 
7   EXT. LOS ANGELES - WAY UP IN THE SKY - DAY                       7 
Flying high over the city, it's quiet up here, only the sound of WIND. BELOW, we see the tight grids of SOUTH LOS ANGELES, and the densely-packed TRAFFIC heading north along the 110 FREEWAY, as it angles toward the SKYSCRAPERS of DOWNTOWN L.A. 
We move NORTH and there's DODGER STADIUM plunked at the southern tip of ELYSIAN PARK, and the LA RIVER twisting snakelike up into GRIFFITH PARK -- 
And NORTHWEST past the mountains of Griffith, descending into the VALLEY, where we suddenly DIVE DOWN into WOODLAND HILLS and settle upon the low-slung sprawl of -- 
8   INT./EXT. YELLOW BUS - TAFT HIGH SCHOOL - DAY                    8 
We track backward through a school bus full of STUDENTS. Almost exclusively black and Latino kids. Late 80's fashions. All the way in the BACK ROW we settle on O'SHEA JACKSON, who we now know as -- 
SUPERIMPOSE: O'SHEA JACKSON AKA ICE CUBE 
Raiders cap pulled low over a shoulder-length Jheri curl. Hunched over, wearing a soon-to-be-iconic FROWN of concentration, he SCRIBBLES LYRICS into a NOTEBOOK: 
"BORED AS HELL AND I WANNA GET ILL. SO I WENT TO THE SPOT WHERE MY HOMEBOYS CHILL --" 
The ROAR of a powerful sports car snaps Cube's concentration. He gazes out the school bus window to see that -- 
In stark contrast to those on the bus, just beyond the glass is a sea of WHITE STUDENTS. They hang out, shoot the shit in their nice clothes, hop into their nice cars. It's a club that Cube isn't a part of and it's clear that he can feel it. 
He frowns, looks back down at his notebook as the bus pulls away from Taft High... 
9     INT./EXT. YELLOW BUS - LATER                                  9 
The BUS cruises Southbound on Crenshaw. And compared to the Valley, it looks like BEIRUT out there: Graffiti tags, liquor stores everywhere, boarded-up shops, DUDES loitering, drinking, slanging. Crip throws a rock and hits the bus. 
FIND CUBE sitting halfway back, still doing his thing, writing rhymes, minding his own. 
NEAR HIM, a few KIDS goof around, flash GANG SIGNS out the window at the passing CARS, PEDESTRIANS, not noticing -- 
A10   INT./EXT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS                             A10 
Pulling out of a side street onto Crenshaw, we see two hard- looking O.G. BLOODS. As the bus passes, they CLOCK THE KIDS flashing SIGNS. They can't believe it. Driver Grits his teeth. SPEEDS OUT after the bus -- 
10    INT./EXT. YELLOW BUS - MOMENTS LATER                         10 
The bus rolls to a stop. Before any KIDS can get off -- the O.G. Bloods' truck pulls in front of the bus, blocking the road. Passenger hops out. 
Noticing, the BUS DRIVER goes to shut the doors, but he's too late -- O.G. Blood gets on, strides past the BUS DRIVER -- glock 9mm in hand. 
BUS DRIVER Hey what's going on? -- 
O.G. BLOOD Shut the fuck up, Blood! (Addresses the whole bus) You young muthafuckas wanna die today?! 
Everyone on the bus falls SILENT. By the shocked expression on the kids' faces, they have no clue how or if they're gonna get out of this alive. 
O.G. BLOOD (CONT'D) HUH!? 
He makes his way back to the WANNABE KIDS near the expressionless Cube. Sensing shit is about to jump off, Cube slowly reaches for the WINDOW next to him, starts SLIDING IT OPEN. He edges closer to the window, grabs his NOTEBOOK, fully prepared to jump the fuck out that window. 
O.G. BLOOD (CONT'D) You little Crab ass niggas could've got this whole bus shot the fuck up! We saw that bullshit you was throwing up out the window! Hit me up now! 
WANNABE KID 1 Didn't mean nothin' by it -- just playing around. 
O.G. BLOOD That's yo muthafuckin problem, Blood! This shit ain't nuthin' ta play wit! It's real in the field, nigga! Shit's life and death! I kill Crips for breakfast, Blood! So keep yo' mothafuckin hand down when you see me, Understand?! 
WANNABE KID 1 Yes. 
The O.G. Blood looks over his shoulder, scowls at all the terrified faces staring back at him. 
O.G. BLOOD What you little muthafuckas need to do is start gangbang them got damn books! Learn some shit better then what we doing! If not, I might be the one that kill yo' dumb ass! Remember me! This that Crenshaw Mafia, Blood! 
And with that, the O.G. Blood tucks his gun, and calmly exits the bus -- leaving behind the stunned kids. 
Their truck pulls away into traffic. 
Cube grab his books, get up to exit the bus along with a few others, but not before glancing over at the kids, who sit there sweating, shell-shocked. 
Cube shakes his head at the wannabes. No way he's going out like that. 
11   EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY                                    11 
Cube walks along the streets, Pee Chee folder and notebooks in hand, books under his arm as -- 
We're given tour of the sights and sounds of South Central. The pervasive shudder of LAPD CHOPPERS TAUNT OVERHEAD, DOGS BARKING, as an LAPD SQUAD CAR CRUISES MENACINGLY PAST like a shark in festive waters. 
WHAM! Crash Cop 2 SLAMS Block Dude 1. Forces him to interlock his fingers behind his head -- 
CUBE Officer, can you please explain why you jackin' us? 
CRASH COP 2 We don't have to explain shit! 
Block Dude 1 HOWLS in pain as Crash Cop 2 viciously SQUEEZES his interlocked knuckles. Crash Cop 1 shoots a look to Uniform Cop 2: Settle down, dude! 
TWO MORE SQUAD CARS SCREECH onto the scene. Four UNIFORMED POLICE climb out, to make an even bigger deal out of nothing. 
Cube's Dad, HOSIE, appears up on the porch, pissed. 
HOSIE JACKSON Hey! What the hell's goin' on out here? Those boys all live on this block! 
The Cops ignore him as Cube's mother, DORIS, appears beside Hosie, shocked to see her son getting assaulted -- 
DORIS JACKSON (re: Cube) Officer, that's my son! 
UNIFORM COP 2 Get back inside, ma'am! 
But she starts coming down the steps toward the Cop -- He UNSNAPS his holster, hand grasping his pistol. 
DORIS JACKSON I just wanna know what's going on -- 
The COP jams a FINGER inches away from Doris' face! 
UNIFORM COP 2 Get the FUCK BACK INSIDE, Lady, or I promise I will ruin your night! 
Doris' mouth drops open. The disrespect is incredible. 
ICE CUBE You ain't gotta talk to my moms like that, man! 
Uniform Cop 1 leans down, WHISPERS to Cube -- 
UNIFORM COP 1 You think we give a fuck? This LAPD, boy! Crash Unit! We the only gangstas around here! 
WIDE SHOT: Cube, his parents, and the Block Dudes helpless, held hostage in their own neighborhood. After every pocket is turned out, body patted down and rights violated -- 
UNIFORM COP 2 All right, they check out. We got cards on all of `em already. (to Cube and Co.) Stay out of trouble. 
The cops pile back into their cars leaving behind the stunned neighborhood. Cube grabs his NOTEBOOKS, cleans them off as -- 
A CHOPPER ABOVE DEAFENS ALL SOUND in a PRIMORDIAL ROAR. 
14    OMITTED                                                     14 
A15   INT. DOO-TO'S CLUB - ENTRYWAY - MOMENTS LATER               A15 Muffled MUSIC seeps into the area as SECURITY GUARDS thoroughly SEARCH everyone. One of them stares Eazy down. 
SECURITY GUARD You really wanna be here? This club is full of Pirus. 
REN We straight. 
Eazy LAUGHS, doesn't give a fuck. 
EAZY Thanks for the tip, homie. 
The Security Guard frowns as he allows them into -- 
15   THE MAIN FLOOR                                               15 
MUSIC PUMPING, we FOLLOW EAZY and REN into the CLUB, which is PACKED, people partying their asses off. Everyone's here: REGULAR FOLKS, BLOODS, SKINNY GIRLS, BIG GIRLS, DEALERS, ATHLETES. A true hood cross-section. 
AS WE MOVE through the place, we see CUBE, JINX and TYREE standing near the wall: JINX and TYREE are busy clocking the GIRLS, but CUBE is studying a ripped-out page of LYRICS. 
ON STAGE, wearing purple satin jackets with WORLD CLASS WRECKIN CRU on the back, DRE spins some `80s R&B while his boy, YELLA, leans down, hollers at a GIRL in the crowd. 
Dre spots someone moving through the mass of people -- 
DRE Yo, Yella, man -- Lonzo comin'! 
Yella quickly moves to the record crate, starts sifting through them to look like he's busy as -- 
LONZO WILLIAMS, club PROMOTER and Dre's BOSS approaches. He leans over to Dre: 
LONZO Gonna make sure nothin's poppin' off outside. Keep them fat asses shakin'. None of that rap bullshit, you hear? I want people thinkin' `bout pussy not pistols. (then) And Yella, I saw you talkin to my lady. Keep your fuckin hands to yourself. 
Lonzo shoots Yella a look, then disappears from the stage. 
DRE Why you fuckin with that nigga's girl, man? 
YELLA Why not? 
Dre chuckles, immediately searches the crowd, locking eyes with CUBE. Dre gives him a NOD, and Cube takes a breath, heads toward the Stage -- Moment of truth. 
IN THE BACK, EAZY and REN are surrounded by ladies. But Eazy's attention is clearly -- 
ON STAGE. Cube appears next to Dre, who's cuing up a new record. He stops the music, grabs the mic: 
DRE Compton! I got my homie -- he's about to get his rhyme on for y'all! Give it up for Ice muthafuckin' Cube! 
Dre hands the mic to Cube as the crowd eyeballs him with suspicion and restraint. They're clearly not gonna give him respect til he earns it. Cube steels himself, clenches his jaw, puffs out his chest. And time turns eternal before -- 
DRE drops the needle on Steve Arrington's funked-out WEAK AT THE KNEES (hardcore NWA fans will recognize this track as the original sample for GANGSTA GANGSTA). 
Cube starts rapping, his voice powerful, thick with attitude: 
ICE CUBE Here's a little somethin' about a nigga like me. Never shoulda been let out the penitentiary. Ice Cube would like to say, That I'm a crazy muthafucka from around the way. Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out, Now I'm the muthafucka that ya read about. Takin a life or two, that's what the hell I do. Don't like how I'm livin', well fuck you! 
After only a few lines, the crowd's CHEERING. HOLLERING. Dancing. An infectious vibe. 
And we DRIFT back to Eazy, standing with Ren, feeling the fuck out of this music, pensive look on his face. Something crystallizing as we -- 
16   INT. DOO-TO'S CLUB - LATER                                   16 
But Dre just stands his ground, head cocked to the side, defying the Officer. In a flash -- 
BAM! Dre finds his face planted into the hood of the squad car! Cuffs slapped on! Same for Tyree and the Dude as we -- 
18   EXT. COMPTON POLICE STATION - EARLY MORNING                  18 
DRE emerges from the Police Station, police property bag in hand, to find EAZY waiting for him beside a fresh `63 IMPALA LOWRIDER. 
EAZY They got you for carrying records? That's some gangsta shit, Dre. 
Dre smiles, chuckles -- He's clearly beyond exhausted. 
DRE Cops will throw a nigga in jail for anything. 
At Eazy's car, Dre and Eazy pound hug. 
EAZY Lonzo just left you here, huh? 
DRE Guess he's sick of bailing my ass out. 
Dre kneels down on the pavement, takes his shoelaces from the police property bag and casually starts lacing his sneakers. But Eazy clocks a couple POLICE OFFICERS eyeballing him and Dre. Clearly, he's not comfortable here. Hops into the car. 
EAZY Mind gettin' your funny lookin' ass in the car before they arrest you for some other dumb shit? 
Eazy gestures like, we in front of the police station! Dre realizes. My bad. Hops in. Keeps lacing his sneakers... 
EAZY (CONT'D) Man, I was thinkin' about what you said last night. 
DRE Yeah, and..? 
EAZY It's interestin' -- 
DRE Interestin'? Tell me this, how long you think that shit you doin' gonna last, huh? You ever heard of a happy ending in that game? 
EAZY Shit, man, this all comin' from the nigga I just bailed out. 
DRE Listen, if you can slang dope, you can slang records. You got a mind for this shit, E. 
EAZY Okay so what then -- That nigga last night? Is that what we doin'? 
DRE What, Cube? Nah, he in a group right now, got some other business goin' on. But I got this group called H.B.O. from the east coast. Dope voices, and Cube wrote a song for `em that's crazy. 
Eazy considers for a long moment as we -- 
19   INT. LONZO'S STUDIO - DAY                                    19 
Dre sits in front of a huge MIXING BOARD, adjusting the levels on a hard-driving BEAT. 
A small CREW of Kangol-wearing RAPPERS (HOME BOYS ONLY, aka HBO) are gathered around, reading pages we recognize as CUBE'S LYRICS with befuddled expressions. 
HBO 1 What the fuck is "Gankin"? And what's a "6-4"? 
CUBE (O.S.) It's a car. A `64 Impala. 
Everyone turns to look at CUBE, off to the side, annoyed. 
CUBE (CONT'D) Gankin's when somebody jacks you. Ain't a big deal. Just sounds better that way. 
Another HBO dude chimes in -- 
HBO 2 I dunno, too much cussin' to get radio play. And honestly, nobody gives a fuck about Compton -- 
Dre interrupts from the board, no back down in him. 
DRE Y'all got somethin' to say about Compton? Cause we might have a problem up in this bitch. 
Nobody says a thing. Deafening silence. Then: 
DRE (CONT'D) Then do the lyrics. We losin' time and I'm losin' patience. 
The vibe is tense, unpleasant. Finally: 
HBO 1 This ain't us. I ain't fuckin' with this Jheri curl bullshit -- 
CUBE Fuck you then. Wearing a Kangol don't make you L.L. Cool J nigga, remember that. 
HBO 1 CRUMPLES the Lyrics sheet into a ball. 
HBO 2 Yeah. Now what? 
CUBE What you wanna do, mark ass nigga? 
Cube and the HBO dudes square up, swelling and huffing -- Without hesitation, Eazy gets up, stands beside Cube. Dre whips off his headphones and flanks Cube from the other side. These dudes have each other's back, ready to throw down. 
The HBO clowns start exiting, talking shit. 
Eazy wanders back over to the couch, plops down, sighs: 
EAZY Well there goes the talent. Don't know a whole lot about the music game, but we can't start a label without talent. 
The three of them chuckle. Eazy sighs, shakes his head. 
EAZY (CONT'D) Okay, I put up my money -- I held up my side of the deal, Dre. When you gonna deliver your side? 
DRE Well shit, why don't you get on the mic and try it? 
EAZY What? Fool, I ain't no rapper. 
Off Eazy's unsure look -- 
DRE You already spent the money. Don't you get it? Man, this song is all about you! This song is about Eazy-muthafuckin'-E! Now get in the booth. Let me deliver my side of this shit. 
20   INT. LONZO'S STUDIO - LATER                                 20 
Laughter as Dre cues it up, the SONG RESUMING, as we -- 
22   INT. MACOLA RECORDS - LOS ANGELES - DAY                     22 
BOYZ IN THA HOOD is PLAYING OVER -- 
A STACK of VINYL RECORDS moves through a PRESS. A machine STAMPS a RED LABEL onto the MIDDLE. CLOSE ON the RED RUTHLESS LABEL -- BOYZ N THA HOOD. 
IN THE RECEIVING AREA, EAZY picks up a couple BOXES of RECORDS. He PAYS for them, and hauls them away. 
23   INT. RECORD STORE - CENTRAL AVE - COMPTON - DAY             23 
BOYZ keeps on THUMPING -- 
DRE and TYREE stand at the counter of a RECORD STORE, with a BOX OF RECORDS. The CLERK takes about SIX RECORDS -- 
24   EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - COMPTON - DAY                         24 
BOYZ continues OVER -- 
Eazy emerges from a RUN-DOWN HOUSE, jogs across the street to his BUCKET, climbs inside, opens his STASH SPOT, stuffs a large WAD of CASH inside. A hustler is always hustlin -- 
25   EXT. BACK YARD HOUSE PARTY - SOUTH CENTRAL - DAY            25 
Some local TEENAGERS are partying, drinking and listening to BOYZ N THE HOOD wax. And that shit has the party bumpin'. 
A sense that this song is going VIRAL, in a contagious, pre- internet sort of way -- 
26   EXT. ROADIUM SWAP MEET - LOS ANGELES - DAY                  26 
BOYZ continues as Eazy brings TWO BOXES of RECORDS to a SWAP MEET BOOTH operated by STEVE YANO. Yano excitedly collects the two boxes, hands over some cash. Deal done. Before Eazy can even bounce, some KIDS bumrush Yano for copies -- 
27   INT. K-DAY RADIO STATION - LOS ANGELES - DAY                27 
BOYZ slowly fades, iconic KDAY Disc Jockey GREG MACK spinning the TRACK over the airwaves of Los Angeles. He grins, bobbing his head, digging this shit for real. 
GREG MACK 1580 KDAY, this is Greg Mack -- Mack Attack. That was "Boyz n tha Hood" by Eazy-E, local rapper out of Compton. Sounds like he's about 15 years old -- 
He glances over to the TELEPHONE SWITCHBOARD, which suddenly LIGHTS UP like crazy, with dozens of CALLERS. 
GREG MACK (CONT'D) -- I know you like it. It's been the most requested record on this station ever since I played it. The freshest song of 1986 -- 
28   INT. MACOLA RECORDS - RECEIVING AREA - DAY                28 
Eazy pays for another couple boxes of records. Grabs them -- 
JERRY HELLER (O.S.) I heard your record. 
Eazy turns to find -- 
JERRY HELLER, a middle-aged guy in a velvet track suit. His face is craggy, seasoned, wise. He's got terrible posture, but lively, hyper-alert eyes. He extends his hand to Eazy. 
JERRY Jerry Heller. 
EAZY Eric Wright. 
JERRY Pleasure to meet you. Would it be possible to have a word with you, Eric? 
EAZY About what? 
29   INT. MACOLA RECORDS - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER              29 
Jerry at his desk, Eazy on the ratty couch. Eazy lets his eyes wander around the shabby office. The sad furniture, the old and irrelevant posters on the walls. 
JERRY I thought your record was good. 
EAZY Just good? Why you call me in here then -- 
Eazy gets up and heads for the door -- 
JERRY No-no-no, hang on. (beat) I thought it was exceptional. Please, sit back down. 
Eazy indulges Jerry. Sits back down and stares, cold, unreadable. Jerry rubs his eyes, frustrated, his regular spiel isn't having its usual effect. 
JERRY (CONT'D) Let's try this again. As a music manager, let me tell you what I can do for you, Eric -- 
EAZY Maybe I'm the one who can do somethin' for you. 
JERRY You think because I don't have some flashy office, that means I don't know what I'm talking about? Elton John, War, Styx, REO Speedwagon -- 
EAZY You manage anybody this decade? 
Jerry leans on his elbows on the desk, cocks his head at Eazy. The balls on this kid. 
JERRY Let me tell you what I see. Lotta raw talent. Lotta braggadoccio. But if you think anyone's gonna talk to you, if you think anyone's gonna let you into the building where you might talk to somebody -- somebody who matters -- you're crazy. 
Eazy frowns, looks away -- 
JERRY (CONT'D) That's what I do for you. I will make you legit. I will take you into that building. I will protect you. I will block out all the noise of this business and we can build something big. (MORE) 
JERRY (CONT'D) But you're gonna have to believe in me like I believe in you. If you don't think you can do that... 
Eazy doesn't budge. Satisfied, Jerry continues -- 
JERRY (CONT'D) You got more music for me? 
EAZY I got everything you need. 
JERRY Good, cause you're gonna have to follow this up. So what does N.W.A. stand for anyway? (with a smile) No Whites Allowed? 
Eazy looks at Jerry. Cold as ice. 
EAZY "Niggas With Attitudes." 
THE CROWD DOPE MAN PLEASE CAN I HAVE ANOTHER HIT??? 
CUBE The Dopeman said Cluck I don't give a shit, if your girl kneels down -- 
THE CROWD AND SUCKS MY DICK!!! 
with each other, like, Oh my God, this is sick! 
IN THE CROWD, we find JERRY and the RECORD EXECS. One of the EXECS looks disgusted, WALKS OUT. Jerry watches him go... 
JERRY So what do ya think? 
RECORD EXEC Jerry, we're friends, but Compton? (laughs) I don't think so. Queens..? Maybe. But. If you find another Bon Jovi, you call me. 
The Exec brushes past Jerry and WALKS OUT. Jerry turns and sees that BRYAN TURNER is the only Exec still there. And he's WATCHING with wide eyes, overwhelmed while -- 
UP ON STAGE, EAZY tears into his verse -- 
EAZY Yeah high-rollin', big money I'm foldin, Bitch on my tip for the dick I'm holdin'. Strung strawberry, jockin' me so early. Ho you want a hit -- 
CROWD YOU GOTTA GET YOUR KNEES DIRTY!!! 
IN THE BACK OF THE CLUB, from a corner, a big man is watching, mind going, This is SUGE KNIGHT. 
33   INT. SKATELAND RINK - LATER                                33 
The last raucous PARTY-GOERS exit, leaving behind some CLEANING CREW and OUR GUYS, still riding the high of performing. 
DOC Damn Dre, ya'll wrecked these mothafuckas tonight! 
DRE I know. Stage was shaking so much-- thought my needles was about to jump off the record! 
CUBE I'm still trippin' that they knew all the words! That's Crazy... 
REN Compton is definitely on the map my nigga! 
YELLA Did you see all the freaks that was out there? Lord, thank God for biker shorts! 
Everybody shoots YELLA a look. 
CUBE We talkin' about the power of N.W.A. and all you saw tonight was pussy? 
YELLA Man, pussy is power. 
They chuckle at Yella in disbelief as SUGE KNIGHT approaches. 
SUGE (surprisingly friendly) Man, I had a feelin' y'all was gonna represent tonight. Good shit. 
EAZY Wuddup, Suge -- What you been up to, homie? Still out in Vegas? 
SUGE Back and forth. Doing some bodyguard work among other things. If ya'll need my services, just let me know. 
EAZY Aight. But we don't need no body guards. 
SUGE You never know what you need until you need it. 
Somewhat of an uncomfortable pause of dead air. 
JERRY rounds the corner, sweating through his misshapen suit, along with BRYAN TURNER. 
SUGE (CONT'D) I just came back here to give ya'll your props. I got my people out here waiting on me. But I'll be around. 
Suge exits... as DOC clocks his flavor-- our attend goes to Jerry and Bryan. 
JERRY That was quite a show, gentlemen. Nice job. Very, very nice. 
They all keep STARING at him, waiting. Jerry grins, enjoying stretching out this moment. 
JERRY (CONT'D) This is Eazy E and NWA. Guys, this is Bryan Turner. 
CUBE (brazenly) Ice Cube, `Sup? 
JERRY Uh, Bryan runs Priority Records. He wants to sign you. 
BRYAN TURNER Immediately. Fellas, I loved the show. You really had the crowd on their feet. I think you'll fit perfectly with our label. 
DRE That'll work. Priority Records? I'm not familiar with your label. What artist do you got over there? 
Bryan looks at Jerry, who folds his arms, chin on his chest. 
BRYAN TURNER Nothing big. Just an R&B group. 
REN Who dat? 
Bryan hesitates, almost ashamed to say -- 
BRYAN TURNER Uh-- The California Raisins. 
Everyone in NWA grimaces -- 
CUBE Them little-ass raisins on the commercial? Singin', "I Heard it Through the Grapevine"? 
Yep. They all LAUGH in Bryan's face. He smiles too. 
BRYAN TURNER Laugh all you want. Those little fuckers went gold last year. 
The laughing stops -- This gets their attention and respect. 
EAZY Gold? 
JERRY Yep, almost platinum. Bryan has a great distribution platform. 
This is the perfect time for Jerry Heller to seal the deal. 
The sound of FOOTSTEPS as Ren, Yella, Cube, and Eazy exit the bus, surround Dre. They can tell something is very wrong. 
YELLA Yo, Dre. What's goin' on? 
ON DRE as he forces back the tears that wanna come, his voice barely a whisper: 
DRE My Moms called. Tyree. He's dead. Somebody killed my little brother... 
Shocked: "What?" "Hell naw!" "What happen?" are heard amongst Cube, Eazy, Yella and Ren-- they crouch down next to Dre. Not sure what else to say or do. They wait for Dre to say more... 
DRE (CONT'D) He got into a fight near Leimert Park. A big mothafucka fell on top of him -- broke his neck. He killed Tyree. I can't believe this shit. 
Face buried in his hands, Dre quietly weeps. 
Jinx, Laylaw and DJ Speed gather in the front window of the bus. Not wanting to interrupt the group's moment. 
Cube rests a hand on Dre's shoulder as the others tighten the circle. There's silence... until: 
CUBE Never told y'all, but when I was twelve, my sister got murdered by her own husband-- A fuckin' wanna be cop who couldn't make it in the academy. Life changed for me that day. Everything became serious-- 
EAZY Dope game took my cousin's life. I remember when they found him. 
DRE He shoulda been out here with me. If he was out here-- It never woulda happened... 
REN Or it could've happened in another way. Can't blame yourself, Dre... Life has to end for all of us, but love don't. Feel me? Tyree is always gonna be with you. No matter what. 
Eazy moves closer. Slowly, he places a hand on Dre's head. Rubs it. It's a bit startling -- Eazy's not one for tenderness. But it's clear he feels Dre's pain. 
EAZY Gonna be aiight, Dre... We with you. 
PULL BACK as the guys remain clustered around Dre. Looking so small, so vulnerable, crouched in front of the Bus, alone in the parking lot. NWA against the world. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
FADE UP: ON; 
53   INT. MAUSOLEUM - LOS ANGELES - DAY                           53 
In a suit, Dre stands beside Tyree's MEMORIAL WALL, his arm draped around his heartbroken mother, Verna. She cries without end or apology, surrounded by family, including his other brother, WARREN G, plus Eazy, Cube, Ren and Yella. 
It's solemn and quiet. Dre remains stoic, staring hard, trying his best to remain strong for his mother. All members of the band keep a close eye on him, as the pastor wraps up his eulogy. 
PASTOR Death is a threshold we all have to pass through. No one is exempt. Tyree will set a place for us on the other side and we will see him again. The flesh will always return to the earth. But our spirits will live on forever. Amen! 
The congregation repeats the pastor with a follow up "Amen." 
54   INT. MAUSOLEUM - LATER                                       54 
A shattered Dre slumps out with his mom, Verna. 
DRE If I brung him out on tour with me, like he wanted -- 
VERNA This is not on you, Andre. 
Dre doesn't say anything. Keeps his head bowed. 
VERNA (CONT'D) Andre. 
DRE We was supposed to kick it... Next chance I got -- 
VERNA This is not your fault. Understand me? Stop this nonsense. Stop it now. 
He looks at his momma. This strong woman. 
VERNA (CONT'D) Your brother looked up to you. And you took great care of him. We both did. It's time to let someone else take care of him now. 
With that, she can no longer hold back the tears. Dre hugs her, mother and son comforting each other. 
VERNA (CONT'D) I'm proud of you... So proud of you, baby... 
Dre fights back tears of his own, the words he's longed to hear. As Verna slowly turns and walks away, Cube, Eazy, Ren and Yella surround him, brothers in arms. They walk out the Mausoleum. 
55      TOUR BUS MONTAGE:                                            55 
55pt1   -- Rural farmland. Flyover-ville. Where the fuck are we? 55pt1 
55pt2   -- Dre stares out the window, despondent, lost in thought... 55pt2 
55pt3   INT./EXT. TOUR BUS                                        55pt3 
-- Cube and Ren jot lyrics on notepads as the bus passes by more PROTESTORS... 
CUBE Check this out -- 
PROTESTOR 1          PROTESTOR 2       PROTESTOR 3 Ban gangsta rap!     Get the hell out   NWA is filth! of here! 
THUD! An egg smacks into the window OBSCURING OUR VIEW. 
REN We should get out and beat his ass. 
55pt4   INT. TOUR BUS                                             55pt4 
-- Yella watches porn next to Eazy who's grown bored... 
EAZY Man shut that off. Put on my shit. 
Disgruntled, Yella obliges. Puts on SCARFACE. Eazy smiles. 
55pt5   INT. TOUR BUS                                          55pt5 
-- Eazy and Jerry mastermind backstage at a concert. Jerry HANDS a BILLBOARD MAGAZINE to Eazy. 
JERRY Moving up on the Billboard 200 albums chart, Holding our bullet the R&B, Hip-Hop chart. I mean, you have any idea how many records we're selling? Ruthless has arrived. Eric, we are huge! 
Cube raises his hand in the air, quickly SNAPS HIS MIDDLE FINGER to attention. Ren does the same with BOTH HANDS -- 
The CROWD RESPONDS by getting LOUDER THAN WE'VE EVER HEARD, and RETURNING the gesture. 
We're talking THOUSANDS of people, all with BOTH MIDDLE FINGERS RAISED -- this is the real shit, this is what they came here for -- 
CUBE (CONT'D) This NWA -- We do what the fuck we wanna do! We say what the fuck we wanna say! So, all I wanna tell that cop talking shit back stage is -- Yo Dre, I got something to say! 
Dre DROPS IT. Cube jumps right into it, pure adrenaline -- 
CUBE (CONT'D) FUCK THE POLICE COMIN' STRAIGHT FROM THE UNDERGROUND. A YOUNG NIGGA GOT IT BAD CAUSE I'M BROWN -- 
The crowd goes ape-shit! BOUNCING and THRASHING like a MOSH PIT. Pure ELECTRICITY-- 
Jerry Heller is suddenly alarmed by the song selection. 
As Cube slices throughout the first verse -- 
Cops are getting agitated -- Waiting for the order to pounce. After their CAPTAIN has seen enough-- He gives the order. 
At that moment, the PLAINCLOTHES COPS in the crowd pull out their BADGES and start MOVING FORWARD through the sea of people, trying to make their way to the STAGE -- 
Cube keeps SPITTING -- lyrics are approaching that mighty hook. 
The UNDERCOVER COPS are causing a lot of commotion in the crowd... When CUBE hits the hook the CROWD JOINS IN, because they know all the lyrics -- 
CUBE & CROWD FUCK THA POLICE! -- FUCK! FUCK! FUCK THA POLICE!-- FUCK THAT POLICE! 
POP-POP-POP -- Cube stops rapping -- the CROWD is momentarily STUNNED! What the hell was THAT? Gunfire? A fucking BOMB? Whatever it was, TOTAL CHAOS BREAKS OUT -- 
The CROWD starts SURGING for the EXITS. Suddenly, DOZENS MORE COPS have MATERIALIZED OUT OF NOWHERE -- 
All the members of NWA DROP their mics and rush off stage, while the Arena descends into mayhem behind them -- 
59   INT. JOE LOUIS ARENA - BACK STAGE - CONTINUOUS               59 
It's CHAOTIC. Tons of COPS, both UNIFORMED and UNDERCOVER, SWARM as the Guys RACE past a LIVID Eazy and Jerry -- 
EAZY What the fuck did you DO!? 
No time for answers, THEY RUN TOO. Jerry can't believe the cops are on their tails. 
60   EXT. JOE LOUIS ARENA - LOADING AREA - CONTINUOUS             60 
All the GUYS try to make their way to an idling VAN which is waiting to whisk them away to safety, but -- 
REN Aw fuck... 
Because they all just noticed TWO THINGS: 1) there are DOZENS of rabid FANS gathered outside, and 2) there are also A SHIT- LOAD OF POLICE, holding back the FANS. The GROUP is spotted by some COPS, who peel off and head STRAIGHT FOR THEM -- 
ICE CUBE Here we go y'all... 
The COPS are immediately ON them, grabbing, frisking, CUFFING, and DRAGGING them all toward a PADDY WAGON which has materialized outside. 
And as soon as the CROWD sees their beloved NWA being hauled away, they go NUTS, and start throwing BOTTLES and ROCKS at the COPS, who DUCK and SWERVE to avoid the projectiles. 
The CROWD starts CHANTING, at a deafening volume -- 
CROWD FUCK THE POLICE. FUCK THE POLICE. FUCK THE POLICE. FUCK THE POLICE -- 
Before it gets any hairier, the COPS start PILING NWA into the PADDY WAGON. JERRY HELLER tries to shove his way over -- 
JERRY You have no right! This is illegal! You can't do this -- 
But the Detroit Cops don't give a shit, they SLAM Jerry up against a wall, hold him there. 
COP Stay fucking put, old man! 
Jerry watches helplessly as the Paddy Wagon PEELS AWAY into the night, taking our heroes away -- 
61   OMITTED                                                        61 
62   INT./EXT. TOUR BUS - OPEN ROAD - THE NEXT DAY                  62 
The bus cruises along as we PUSH INSIDE to the sound of -- 
63   INT. TOUR BUS - MOVING                                         63 
Silence, save the rumble of the road. Everyone sits by himself, semi-secluded. Nobody talks. They all just stare out the windows, embroiled in thought. Exhausted. Shell-shocked. 
Jerry watches a NEWS REPORT on the riot at the Detroit show. 
JERRY What the fuck were you guys thinking? They can hold us libel for inciting a riot! No one cares that the police started it... 
Dre, Ren and Yella start paying attention as Eazy switches channels. Finds another report about the riot. And another. And another. Images blurring by of the concert. 
JERRY (CONT'D) Whether you like it or not, you are a political group. Never give these assholes a reason to hurt you. Next time they might take it. 
The guys watch, realizing that they're becoming a part of the zeitgeist. No longer in the news, they are the news. 
KURT LODER (PRE-LAP) The explosive Compton rap group, N.W.A. -- 
HARD CUT TO: 
64   CLOSE ON MTV NEWS REPORT (STOCK FOOTAGE)                       64 KURT LODER -- aka Niggers With Attitudes, officially had their video banned here at MTV due to gang-like images that could incite violence. This is not the first scrape with controversy for the band -- 
65   INT. HOTEL - CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                 65 
CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! NWA sit at a long table being interviewed for a PRESS JUNKET, dozens of microphones thrust in their faces, cameras flashing. All the members are engaged, leaning forward, elbows on the table. They got each other's back as WE PARACHUTE IN: 
JOURNALIST 1 How do you explain insighting a riot in Detroit? What do you have to say about that? 
EAZ We didn't insight shit. 
CUBE That's my money anyway, Jerry. I earned it. I wrote a lot of hit songs. I been on tour for months. (MORE) 
CUBE (CONT'D) Performing. Gettin' arrested and shit. And you gonna try to gank me? 
JERRY That's ridiculous. 
CUBE Give me my money, Jerry. 
JERRY You're kidding me, right? Who do you think pays for everything? All the hotel rooms, the parties, the transpo? You think that's free? 
Cube closes his eyes. Takes a deep breath. He must literally will himself to not implant his fist in Jerry's face. 
CUBE Why all this now,   Jerry? Back in the beginning, if   you thought we were so good, why   didn't you just give us contracts   then? 
JERRY Nothing's a sure thing, Cube. Even a great talent can crash and burn. Too much ego, too much excess, too many expectations -- it tends to ruin things. You oughta keep that in mind. 
Cube stares hard. Knows exactly what Jerry's implying. 
CUBE I'm gonna ask one more time. Are you sayin' I can't have the money I earned, unless I sign this contract, right now, without showin' it to anybody? 
Jerry just crosses his arms, looks at Cube, says nothing. 
CUBE (CONT'D) Bye, Jerry. 
He turns and walks out of the room -- 
69   INT. DOUBLETREE SUITES - LOBBY - DAY                        69 
Dre, Ren and Yella lounge on the lobby couch, packed bags beside them. And they couldn't be happier. 
REN I'mma get me a El Camino with some gold Daytons and a Phantom top. 
YELLA I can't wait to get out of that "po- man's Porsche" and get me some real shit -- 
Face crumpled with anger, Cube approaches. Drops his bags. 
CUBE Y'all signed that Ruthless contract without a lawyer? 
REN Yeah -- And we got paaaaaid! 
YELLA For $75,000 dollars, I don't give a fuck what's in that contract! 
Dre and Ren chuckle at Yella's candor. 
DRE You ain't signed? 
CUBE Hell naw I ain't signin' that bullshit. Don't y'all think it's a little fucked up that Jerry won't let us show it to nobody? That seem honest to y'all? If he offered us seventy-five thousand, he probably owes us double that. (to Ren) Thought we talked about this, dude? 
REN It is what it is... I don't trust Jerry but I trust Eric. 
Cube's disgusted by their ignorance. Only Dre seems to be considering Cube's words -- 
CUBE At this point, Eric and Jerry in this thing together. Believe dat! 
70   EXT. LEIMERT PARK - LATE AFTERNOON                           70 
The bus is parked back where the tour began. Exhausted, D.O.C. 
exits the bus and heads toward a BURGUNDY CHEVY BLAZER, where SUGE KNIGHT waits to pick him up. D.O.C. throws his bags in the back. Kicks it with Suge for a minute as -- 
Eazy exits the bus with Yella. They watch D.O.C. and Suge. 
EAZY What up with Doc and Suge? 
YELLA Guess that dude's "managing" him now. One day you Bobby Brown's bodyguard, next day you reppin' talent. Everybody wanna get into the act... 
Dre exits, looking discouraged. And we understand why when an equally despondent Cube exits the bus and begins to move away from the crew. Dre catches up to him -- 
DRE Yo Cube-- You can't just sign that shit, homie..? Keep making history..? 
CUBE Naw man, not like this. I'd rather be broke then get fucked -- Why did you sign that shit, Dre? 
DRE Nigga, I got bills to pay -- and I need to put some money in my Momma's hands after Tyree passed. 
CUBE Yo, I get it. Everybody gotta do what they gotta do. They're gonna take care you. You they're bread and butter. 
DRE Cube, we Ruthless. 
CUBE Nah, we NWA. They Ruthless. 
T-BONE (O.S.) You comin', Cube? 
Cube turns to find T-BONE from the Lench Mob and Jinx, waiting for him in his CAR. He looks back at Dre -- I'm out. They pound hug and Cube heads off. Hops into T-Bone's ride. 
BACK WITH DRE, considering the scene as everyone drives away, going in separate directions: 
Cube leaves with T-Bone... Yella leaves with Ren... Eazy leaves with Jerry... And D.O.C. leaves with Suge... 
Dre finds himself all alone, confronting a new reality. 
A71   INT./EXT. T-BONES CAR - MOMENTS LATER                       A71 
Cube rides in the passenger seat, pretty low at this point. No money, no group. JINX MOUTH IS RUNNING, but Cube's in a daze -- doesn't hear a word he's saying. 
JINX Can't believe you left the group, man. What you gonna do now? Guess we gotta start working on some solo stuff, huh? Cube? Cube?! 
As the car pulls up to a stop light, Cube looks over, spots a beautiful YOUNG LADY in a nice jeep on rims. She's looks back over at him, their eyes locked. Is this love at first sight? After a few magical moments. Cube finally speaks. 
CUBE How you doing? My name O'Shea. What's yours? 
KIM Kim. 
CUBE Hey Kim-- You the best thing I've seen all day. 
D.O.C. Interrupts -- 
D.O.C. Wuddup, Dre. There's some bitches up in here, right? (to Suge) Yo, you take care of that shit for me? 
SUGE I'm on it. 
Dre takes notice of the exchange as we -- 
A74   INT. PRIORITY RECORDS - BRYAN TURNER'S OFFICE - DAY      A74 
Cube is standing in Bryan Turner's office, and we can tell, right off, things are tense. 
CUBE I'm just tellin' you what you told me. If Amerikkka's Most blew up, you'd advance me for the follow-up. That's what you said. 
BRYAN TURNER It's more complicated than that, Cube, there's metrics -- 
CUBE Come on, Bryan. I don't even know what that means. (MORE) 
CUBE (CONT'D) Man, I got a kid on the way -- and I just bought a house on the strength of what you told me. You gave me your word. 
Bryan stands up, holds his hands out, tries to soothe -- 
BRYAN TURNER Cube. Relax. We're on the same team here. I'm your biggest fan -- 
CUBE It's like this shit keeps happenin' to me, no matter what I do. When people do the work, they should get paid. Why you making it seem like I'm begging for some shit that's technically mine? 
BRYAN TURNER Of course your not begging -- and I'm not trying to be difficult. 
Cube glances around at all the GOLD and PLATINUM records adorning the walls in Bryan's office. 
CUBE But you can't help me. That's what you're sayin'. 
Bryan puts his hands in his pockets, hangs his head. The answer is obvious. Cube stares at him a beat, then turns his back, heads out the door -- 
BRYAN TURNER Cube, wait, Cube, come back -- 
B74   INT. PRIORITY RECORDS - BRYAN'S OFFICE - LATER              B74 
Bryan's still in his office, grinding through some work. 
CUBE (O.S.) Shoulda kept your word, Bryan. 
CUBE and THE LENCH MOB (same dudes we saw at Greene Street) enter, Cube holding a METAL BASEBALL BAT! IN A FLASH, he's SMASHING THE FUCK OUT OF THE OFFICE. His boys split up, block Bryan, block the doorway -- no one in, no one out. 
BRYAN TURNER STOP! STOP! WHAT THE FUCK, CUBE!??! 
Cube SMASHES the GOLD and PLATINUM RECORDS on the WALLS, the ARTWORK, the GLASS COFFEE TABLE. Pretty much everything else that's breakable. 
BRYAN TURNER (CONT'D) FINE! FINE, I'LL GET YOU YOUR MONEY! JUST STOP! 
But Cube keeps on SMASHING, until there's nothing left to smash. THE OFFICE IS COMPLETELY DESTROYED. 
Cube's out of breath, but he looks pretty exhilarated. He drops the bat on the floor, walks out of the decimated office, followed by the other guys. 
Bryan remains standing there, speechless, in shock -- 
74   INT. AUDIO ACHIEVEMENTS STUDIO - LATER                       74 
Dre, Eazy, Ren and Yella work on their follow-up album. D.O.C.'s here, too, drinking gin, straight, buzzing. 
IN THE BOOTH, Ren's recording REAL NIGGAZ... 
REN ... Prisoner like a hostage. You shoulda covered your muthafuckin' head like an ostrich. Deep in the dirt cause you a sucka. And your ass up high so I can kick the muthafucka -- 
Dre watches from the board, uncharacteristically detached. 
EAZY That's what I'm talkin' about. Cube ain't shit. 
DRE How you figure? That record's still the hottest shit out there. 
YELLA For real. Cube killed it -- 
EAZY That's why we gotta go hard at him. We gonna look like some bitches if we just take that shit. 
D.O.C. Take what? (beat) I don't know what the fuck you talkin' about. I like that shit. 
Yella nods, but Dre doesn't even respond. Just keeps plodding away on the board as D.O.C. proceeds unsteadily toward the door, bumping into Eazy on the way -- 
EAZY Man, why you gotta be drunk all the time? Get your shit together. 
D.O.C. keeps on walking, barking back: 
D.O.C. Get your own shit together, lil nigga -- 
As he exits we focus back on the studio. One thing's clear: no one's enjoying themselves anymore. 
75   INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                 75 
Eazy enjoys dinner with a lovely, put-together young woman, TOMICA. She's nobody's groupie. She's serious, and smart. 
TOMICA This place is nice. Wow, I didn't realize this was a real "date" date. I thought we were just going out to eat. You bring all your females here? 
EAZY Only the special ones. (beat) Actually I've never been here before, but I heard it's good. (Jokingly) High as it is, it better be. 
He smiles. She laughs affably, shakes her head. 
TOMICA You know I have a job, right? 
EAZY Excuse me, Miss Record Executive. 
TOMICA Executive Assistant. Ya know, you don't have to impress me. We could've went to Fat Burgers. I just like hangin with you. You make me laugh. That's good enough for me, you know? We can just chill. 
Eazy nods, knows she's right. His eyes catch a SEXY WOMAN sashaying past. He SMILES at her, and she SMILES back. 
Dre and D.O.C. sit and listen to NO VASELINE-- with every line D.O.C. makes a different "dunk face" indicating how embarrassed he is for his homie Dre. 
CUBE (ON TRACK) Yella Boy's on your team so you're LOSIN'! And yo, Dre? Stick to producin'. Callin' me Arnold, but you Been-A-Dick. Eazy saw your ass, and went in it QUICK. 
As we pan over to Dre, we can see that he kind of digs the creativity and lyrics. He confirms it with a slight smirk and chuckle. Clearly blowing the song off. 
78    INT. JERRY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                              78 
NO VASELINE CONTINUES over -- 
Jerry and N.W.A., minus Dre and D.O.C., listen to the track, faces grimaced: 
CUBE (ON TRACK) Y'all disgrace the C-P-T. `Cause you gettin' fucked out your green by a white boy, with No Vaseline. 
Ren and Yella slouch in the corner, looking very unhappy. 
CUBE (ON TRACK) (CONT'D) ... So don't believe what Ren say, cause he goin out like Kunta Kinte. But I got a whip for ya, Toby; used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me -- 
But Cube has saved the best for last. He unleashes upon EAZY and JERRY, who LISTEN intently, jaws dropped. 
CUBE (ON TRACK) (CONT'D) You little maggot, Eazy E turned faggot. With your manager, fella, fuckin' MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella. But if they were smart as me, Eazy E would be hangin' from a tree. With no vaseline, just a match and a little bit of gasoline. Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on. Til that Jheri curl is gone. On a permanent vacation, off the Massa plantation. Heard you both got the same bank account -- Dumb nigga, what you thinkin' about? Get rid of that Devil real simple: put a bullet in his temple. Cuz you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew with a white Jew tellin' you what to do -- 
Jerry looks absolutely livid, while Eazy just looks caught off guard. Jerry gets up and TURNS OFF the music -- 
YELLA That shit's kinda funny. 
Everybody gives YELLA the look. 
REN Mothafucka got us! What we gonna do? I got my pen ready to serve that fool. Just say the word. 
Eazy is still trying to digest the track. 
JERRY We'll sue that worthless fuck. Defamation, libel... That anti- Semitic piece of shit, I'm gonna call up my friends at the J.D.L. and we'll see how he likes that, little bastard. (off Eazy's despondent look) Eric, come on, we gotta get organized here, we gotta fight -- 
EAZY Stop it, Jerry. Relax man. Niggas don't know what anti-Semitic means - - It's just a battle rap. 
JERRY (still hopping mad) I always knew Cube was a rotten human being. And people are gonna know the facts. I'll make sure of it. I can't believe you're not as angry as I am, what's wrong with you? Didn't you hear what he said? 
EAZY I heard it, Jerry. You deal with it your way, I'll deal with it mine. All we got to do is hit the studio and end this boy career. 
YELLA I don't know about all that. 
JERRY Well call Dre and you guys go do it! 
And Jerry storms out, leaving the crew behind -- 
REN Damn, E. Who work for who? 
EAZY Who you see sitting in the big chair mothafucka?! 
Eazy re-establishes that he's the top dog at Ruthless.

81   EXT. JERRY'S HOUSE - FRONT - NIGHT                         81 
Jerry pulls into his driveway, gets out of the car, carrying a bag of groceries, starts walking toward the door. He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, and he TURNS, sees a gleaming-new EL CAMINO parked across the street. A very large BLACK MAN we haven't seen before has emerged, and is walking toward him. 
The Man STOPS about fifteen feet away from Jerry, and stands there, just staring, patiently, ominously. 
JERRY Help you with something? 
LARGE MAN This your house? 
Jerry looks at the Man. Glances up and down the street. There's nobody around. It couldn't be quieter. 
JERRY Who's asking? 
LARGE MAN It's a real nice house. 
Jerry glances at the front door of the house. Seems to be gauging, in his mind, how long it will take to get there. 
JERRY Who are you? Are you with Suge Knight? Someone else? Ice Cube? 
The Man doesn't answer. Instead, he just gazes upon the house, the lush surrounding lawn, the trees. 
LARGE MAN Have yourself a good night, Jerry. 
He makes a hat-tipping gesture to Jerry. Except he's not wearing a hat. Then he walks back to the car, climbs inside. Jerry watches him go, alarmed -- 
82   INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NEW YORK CITY - DAY                     82 
We are in a HALLWAY adjacent to the AUDITORIUM where a RAP PANEL is about to take place. 
Find CUBE drifting down the escalator along with THE LENCH MOB, and they're all decked out in their Lench Mob Gear. 
Coming up the escalator on the other side, is the rap group ABOVE THE LAW (ATL), all wearing gear blazing the RUTHLESS RECORDS logo. 
As the two groups approach each other, they both get QUIET, and their faces pull into angry sneers. The animosity between the two groups is tense, palpable, dangerous. 
Just as they're about to PASS each other -- 
ATL GUY 1 (under his breath) Fuckin' traitor... 
But Cube and his boys heard that shit. 
CUBE Fuck'd y'all say!? 
ATL GUY 2 Ruthless, muthafuckas! 
AND THEN IT POPS OFF! Some of the ATL CREW hop the escalator divider, others sprint down the other side to attack -- 
DRE (CONT'D) Thought you were my brother. 
EAZY Thought you were mine, too. 
Dre walks out the door -- SLAMS it so hard, the walls shake. A platinum NWA record slides off the wall, breaks on the floor. Eazy FLINCHES, even though he wishes he didn't. 
A86   OMITTED                                                  A86 
B86   INT. AUDIO ACHIEVEMENTS STUDIO - DAY                     B86 Ren and Yella enter to find Eazy on the mixing board, more than a little out of his element. They look at one another, confused -- Clearly, something's up. 
REN Everything cool, E? 
No response. Eazy just keeps poking around on the board... 
YELLA Yo where Dre at anyway -- 
EAZY Man, fuck Dre. 
They've finally got Eazy's undivided but heated attention. 
YELLA Whatchu mean? 
EAZY Why don't y'all ask him. 
REN Fuck you talkin' about? He comin' or not -- 
EAZY That nigga quit. So nah, he ain't comin'. But fuck it, we gonna keep this shit movin'. Don't need that punk anyway... 
Disbelief washes across Ren and Yella's faces as we -- 
C86   INT. CAN AM STUDIOS - DAY                                 C86 
Suge grits on a cigar sitting next to Dre who's at the mixing board working on the track to "Deep Cover". 
SUGE This shit sounds good. 
DRE None of this means anything, while I'm under contract with Ruthless. 
SUGE Don't worry about that. I promise you that I'll get you out of your contracts. 
Dre gets back to the work at hand as   -- 
Warren G and SNOOP DOGG burst into the studio. Snoop Dog is dressed head to toe in blue. 
SNOOP What's up, Cuz. 
Snoop greets everyone around the room pounding each and every person. To the surprise and dismay to the room full of bloods especially Suge Knight. 
SUGE Yo who the fuck's this, Warren? 
WARREN G My bad. 
SNOOP Snoop Doggy Dog, Cuz. Who are you? 
The Bloods around the room are tripping on Snoop. Before it escalates, Dre gets up, greets Snoop properly. 
DRE Glad y'all came by. Your demo was tight. 
SNOOP Thanks, Dre. 
DRE Well listen, I'm workin' on a track for this movie called "Deep Cover." I want you to get down on it. 
SNOOP For real? 
Dre smiles back at Snoop: Yup, for real. 
SNOOP (CONT'D) Oh hell yeah... 
Snoop walks into the booth, puts on some headphone's as we -- 
86   INT. EAZY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                 86 
The PHONE RINGS. Eazy answers -- 
EAZY Hello? 
SUGE (FILTERED) We need to talk about them contracts. 
EAZY Talk to Jerry. 
SUGE (FILTERED) Don't wanna talk to Jerry. It's your company. You're the man. 
Eazy doesn't say a word, considering, deeply conflicted. 
SUGE (FILTERED) (CONT'D) Come by the studio. We'll be here all night. Just workin'. We just wanna squash this. Make it right for you. 
87   EXT. S.O.L.A.R. STUDIOS - LOS ANGELES - LATE NIGHT           87 
Parked across the street, Eazy looks at the building, not happy about it. Enemy territory. He opens up his STASH BOX in a hidden panel below the radio. There's a PISTOL inside. He reaches in, puts his hand around it. Hesitates, hearing -- 
A DISTANT POLICE SIREN. Pulls his hand away, leaves the piece. He hops out of the car, walks toward -- 
88   INT. S.O.L.A.R. STUDIOS - STUDIO - MINUTES LATER             88 
Eazy enters the Studio, sees only SUGE sitting there, smoking a cigar, petting his DOG. He comes further into the room, peeks around, looking for -- 
EAZY Where the hell is Dre? You said he'd be here -- 
SUGE Don't worry about Dre. (beat) Truth be told, he ain't got nothing to do with this right here. 
Suge pulls out a sheaf of papers, and a pen. 
SUGE (CONT'D) Here's what's gonna happen. You're gonna sign these. Releasing Dre and The D.O.C. from Ruthless. 
JOURNALIST Are you Anti-Semitic? 
CUBE What? I thought this interview was about the Rodney King trial? 
JOURNALIST The J.D.L. has recently gotten involved, saying that the lyrics regarding your former manager Jerry Heller -- 
But Cube's too smart to fall for this crap. 
CUBE I'm not Anti-Semitic. I'm Anti- Jerry Heller. Let me ask you a question -- do they condone Jerry's behavior when it comes to my situation? Him trying to get me to sign a contract without legal representation? 
JOURNALIST I have no idea. 
CUBE Well, you get me that answer and then we can continue on this topic. Until then, let's talk about the beating of an unarmed motorist -- Rodney King and the trial of 4 guilty L.A.P.D. Officers who seem to be Darryl Gates' standard issue - 
JOURNALIST But it isn't just the Jewish community. The Korean grocer community have also accused you of racism, mostly because of your song "Black Korea" -- 
CUBE Come on, man. That don't even make no sense. Black Korea is just a warning. That's it. I'm a journalist, just like you! Reporting on what's going on in the hood. But the difference is that I'm brutally honest about it. Cause sugar coating will get you diabetes. 
A couple of members of the Nation of Islam are quietly seen in the background as the journalist struggles, tries to gain a foothold -- 
JOURNALIST What's your relationship with the Nation of Islam? 
Cube just smiles, shakes his head. 
CUBE There my brothers. That question alone just proves how unprepared of a "sandbag reporter" you really are. You wanna talk about Anti- Semitism? Then it's "Black Korea," and now you wanna talk about the Nation of Islam? Seriously, man. What's your agenda? You can't focus on one thing? Ask me something interesting. I'm not an elected official. I'm an artist. You haven't asked me one damn question about music. I'm America's conscience. I represent the good, the bad and the ugly. What you represent? 
92   INT. DRE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                      92 
The massive room's focal point is a BASIC STUDIO SETUP: SSL, some turntables, a mic, some keyboards, a tower of speakers. 
SUPERIMPOSE: SIX MONTHS LATER 
Dre sits in the epicenter of it all, motionless, lost. It's the first time we've seen him anywhere near a soundboard and not creating on it. He just stares into the nothingness -- 
A TAP ON GLASS alerts us to SNOOP, Warren G and DOC (small scare on DOC's neck) outside. Dre stands. Opens the window. 
DRE What you fools doin' out here? 
WARREN G Watching you daydream for the last five minutes. 
DOC (raspy voice) Looking stupid as a mothafucka. 
SNOOP Come take a ride with us Dr. Dre. You gotta get out this house, Cuz and get your mind right. 
INT. DRE'S CAR - LOS ANGELES - MINUTES LATER 
Snoop at the wheel, they ride listening to ATOMIC DOG by George Clinton. Snoop's at the wheel, smoking a JOINT (surprise), Dre shotgun, Warren G and D.O.C. in the back. 
SNOOP What you so tense for, Cuz? 
DRE I'm cool. 
WARREN G No you not. You been up in that house for a month now, and not one track? Wassup, what's wrong? 
DRE First time in my life, I feel like I'm forcin' it. 
WARREN G Why? 
DRE Too much outside interference -- Eazy and Jerry tryin' to starve me out. Playin' games with my money. Tryin' to get me back in there on my hands and knees -- 
SNOOP Is that why you ain't got no furniture? 
Snoop holds out the jay. 
SNOOP (CONT'D) This shit'll chill you out. 
DRE Nah, that ain't me. I'm good. 
WARREN G Come on, big bro. Loosen up. 
DRE (reconsidering) Fuck it, gimme that shit. 
Dre takes a deep pull, holding it in before COUGHING out a massive cloud. They all laugh. And Dre takes another hit. An even bigger one. 
DRE (CONT'D) Wow. What is in this shit? 
SNOOP That shit right there? That's the Chronic. 
Dre TURNS UP the music. 
SNOOP (CONT'D) You never smoked before? 
DRE No. I can feel it in my nuts, man. Is that normal? 
Dre finds himself laughing with the guys as they cruise on... 
94   INT. DRE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                         94 
Dre's behind the SSL, listening to a rhythm based on Leon Heywood's I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING FREAKY TO YOU. Warren G, Snoop, and D.O.C are in different corners of the room. Smoke floats over Snoop's head like a halo. 
The vibe is positive and laid back, but as we look at Dre's face we can tell what he's thinking: something's missing. 
Dre turns to the MOOG Keyboard situated on the side of the board and starts noodling with a melody. It's almost familiar. But not quite. 
Then he hits it: Da do dee dah dee dah dah dee do deee... 
Just like that, we've witnessed the birth of AIN'T NUTHIN' BUT A G THANG. 
SNOOP Oh shit. Keep playing that. 
Dre does the same ten notes -- That's it! It's G THANG. 
SNOOP (CONT'D) (freestyling) One. Two. Three into the Four. Snoop Doggy Dogg and Dr. Dre is at the door... (rap continues) 
Everyone TURNS! GIRLS IMMEDIATELY START SCREAMING because -- 
DRE'S HOUSE IS ON FIRE! Huge orange FLAMES lick up the siding, spreading quickly. BLACK SMOKE pours into the sky! 
Everybody SCATTERS, tripping over each other, falling on the lawn, because let's not forget everyone is WASTED. 
Find DRE, watching the flames, almost hypnotized by them, because it doesn't seem real. Warren G staggers up beside him, watching on, eyes like saucers. 
WARREN G Your house is on fire. 
DRE Yeah. (beat) Shit's crazy, right. 
WARREN G Maybe I shouldn't have thrown them coals in the trash. 
Dre suddenly snaps out of it. Because -- 
DRE MY FUCKIN' MASTERS! 
Against all logic, Dre storms INTO THE BURNING HOUSE as the SOUNDS of DISTANT SIRENS ring out -- 
100   INT. CAN AM STUDIOS - OFFICE - DAY                          100 
Dre and Suge talk in a corner of the studio. Voices low. 
DRE What do you mean that everyone is passing on this record? 
SUGE What do you think? 
Dre shakes his head. 
SUGE (CONT'D) They all turned it down. "Too many live instruments. It's not hip- hop." 
DRE It's not hip-hop? Shit, it's the future. Ain't no more money in sampling everythang. 
SUGE This guy has a lot of money. This is the only shot we got. 
DRE Okay, shoot. 
As they walk to the other side of the studio we WIDEN TO REVEAL JIMMY IOVINE. He's older and white, wearing glasses with a baseball cap pulled low over his eyes. 
JIMMY (extends his hand) Jimmy Iovine. Interscope Records. It's nice to meet you. Dre or Dr Dre. What should I call you? 
DRE Dre's cool. How are you doing? I heard John McClain gave you my album. What did you think? 
Jimmy smiles. 
JIMMY IOVINE I think it was great. (beat) So, you're the artist on this record. Who produced it? 
DRE I did. 
JIMMY IOVINE Who engineered it? 
DRE I did. 
JIMMY IOVINE Listen. I don't know anything about hip hop. And to be honest with you, I don't necessarily care for it. But I know this is special. 
The word special resonates with Dre. He nods. 
DRE Thank you. 
SUGE We'd love to bring it to Interscope. But there's a problem. 
JIMMY IOVINE What's the problem? 
SUGE Ruthless. Lawsuits. (beat) Contracts. 
JIMMY IOVINE How about this. Give me three weeks. But I don't want to hear any bullshit about you shopping it anywhere else. If you do that. I believe I can get you out of this mess. Sound good? 
Suge smiles. 
101   EXT. LOS ANGELES - DAY                                      101

JERRY (PRE-LAP) Eazy. You may wanna see this. 
102   INT. JERRY'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS               102 
Jerry turns the volume up as Eazy plops down on the couch beside him -- 
TOM BROKAW (V.O.) ... a stunning verdict of "not guilty" for the L.A. Four today in Simi Valley... 
PUSH IN CLOSE ON EAZY, seeing the verdict. 
JERRY (O.S.) Sorry... 
EAZY Sorry? We all ought to be sorry... (then) We had them on tape -- we had their asses on tape. 
Eazy continues to watch, pained and perplexed, as we see -- 
EXT. SOUTH CENTRAL - STREETS - DAY 
Cube drives through SOUTH CENTRAL in the epicenter of the unfolding RIOTS. Looting stores. Burning buildings. 
He drives by GRAFFITI TAGS, many of which say FUCK THA POLICE. He sees a CRIP and a BLOOD, tying their RED and BLUE bandanas together in front of one such tag: a SYMBOL of the GANG TRUCE. 
NEARBY, crowds of young people CHANT: 
CROWD No justice, no peace! Everybody say, fuck the police! No justice, no peace! Everybody say, fuck the police! 
A very proud Cube watches. His own words turned into a unifying slogan for the riots. And we see -- 
CUBE Hey Darrell. What you been doing? -- playin' with Shea? 
Darrell nods as Kim picks up the remote, starts FLIPPING channels. She STOPS when it lands on THE BOX, which just happens to be playing NWA's STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON. Cube watches for a bit, lost in thought -- 
KIM Look how young you guys look. 
Cube looks for a moment -- shakes his head, in disbelief. 
CUBE Damn... We left some good records on the table... 
Kim walks closer-- rubs his shoulders lovingly... 
KIM Well-- ain't nobody burnt down the table did they? Ever thought about getting back together? 
CUBE All the time. But we've been feuding for so long. It might be "ON" on sight when we see each other. I really don't know. 
KIM That's a shame. It's terrible how money tears us apart. 
CUBE Yeah-- When it should be bring us together. Somebody always wants more then they're suppose to get. As that's when shit get funky. 
She nods in agreement -- as he continues working on his script. A movie called "FRIDAY". 
112   INT. NICE RESTAURANT - LOS ANGELES - NIGHT                  112 
Dre's having dinner with NICOLE -- the woman who rejected him at his party. Even though they're both clearly feeling this. 
DRE Aren't you glad I tracked you down? 
NICOLE I wasn't exactly hiding. 
They both chuckle. 
DRE So wassup, you been havin' good time? 
NICOLE Yeah... Why? 
DRE Well I mean, I like comin' over your place, but you know, your neighbors be complainin' about "the noise" -- 
Nicole smiles, shoos Dre. He smiles at her, mesmerized. God damn this girl is special. He fills up their champagne. 
DRE (CONT'D) I think a little more privacy would be better. 
NICOLE So what, you want me to move? 
DRE Yeah, maybe. I know of a perfect spot. Plenty of room, and I know the owner. 
Nicole finally gets what Dre's saying. Smiles. 
NICOLE After a few months, you sure you're ready for that, Andre? 
DRE Yeah. I'm really feelin' you like that. 
NICOLE I'm feelin' you too, but... 
Nicole considers, conflicted. Dre can't stand it any longer. 
DRE Hey you know what, don't worry about it right now. Was just a thought... 
Dre drinks his glass of champagne down. 
DRE (CONT'D) Listen, I don't mean to change the temperature in here. But it had to be crazy, bein' married to a Laker. 
NICOLE Wasn't what I'd call a good fit. It got crazy once we moved to L.A. I definitely went through some unnecessary shit when he started acting like an asshole. But I have a beautiful son and all that other nonsense is behind me now. 
DRE Look, no offense, but I'm a little glad he was an asshole. (raising his glass) His loss is my gain. To assholes. 
NICOLE (playfully) Chin-chin. 
They share a laugh as Nicole raises her glass -- CLINK. Dre downs his glass as we -- 
113   EXT. NICOLE'S APARTMENT - WESTWOOD - LATER                113 
Dre walks Nicole to her door, and pretty soon they're kissing. It's nice, but after a bit, she pulls away. 
NICOLE All right -- Good night. 
Dre looks surprised. 
DRE Really? Good night? 
NICOLE Are you okay to drive? 
DRE No. 
They both laugh. 
NICOLE Good night, Andre. 
DRE See, I can't help thinkin', maybe you want me to come inside... 
NICOLE Of course I do. 
DRE So what's different now? 
NICOLE I got a lot of things to think about. (beat) You're asking me to move in... That's a big step. I like you, Andre. But there's a lot going on around you. 
DRE What do you mean? 
NICOLE I read the papers. I'm not stupid. I know about the whole Death Row business, the assault charges, the shooting... Just seems dangerous. My son's my world. 
DRE But I thought we been havin fun. 
NICOLE Fun is fun, Andre. But I refuse to walk away from one crazy life into another. 
Cop raises the glass. 
DRE (CONT'D) Really, ok... 
SUGE (laughing) Who fuckin' shit up! You trippin. We can do anything we want to do. We started this shit. This is us. 
DRE Nah, Nigga. Death Row is us. (pointing around) This other shit -- is you! 
Suge's Goons get in position. 
GOON #1 Better watch ya mouth, Blood. 
DRE 'Tha fuck you talking too? 
GOON #2 (dismissive) Nigga, you ain't nothing but a producer around here. 
DRE What the fuck?!!! 
This sends Dre into orbit. He goes after Blood #1. The whole conference room jumps in between them -- keeping these two human pit bulls from scrappin'. Everybody jumps but Suge who amused by the whole thing -- puffs on his cigar. Dre is being held back by the Off Duties. While Goon #1 is being held back by Goon #2 and a few others. World War III averted for now. 
DRE (CONT'D) Get the fuck off me. 
Dre breaks free and storms out. 
SUGE Man don't even trip off this muthafucka. What he going to do? Where he going to go? 
113pt2 TESTAROSA                                             113pt2 
And just sits there, seething. Reaches in the back seat, grabs a bottle of Hennessey. Takes a swig... Then -- 
A sudden look of determination washes over him. He TEARS out into the street, tires SQUEALING -- ERRRR! 
PASSING CARS, swerving, Dre punches the gas, RPMs maxed out. Shifts, flying through an intersection -- the needle passes 100mph. Keeps going, loving the release, the control... 
A POLICE CRUISER, coming the opposite direction, spots Dre's Testarosa -- In a flash, they bang a U-turn, peeling so fast, smoke clouds the night air -- 
ON DRE, distant police lights now strobing off of his face from the rear view mirror. Fuck! Thinking fast, he switches off his headlights. Hits the gas, needle bottoming-out! 
As he reaches the next intersection, Dre makes a hard left -- SCREECHES to a stop, tucking into a spot along the side of the road. Shuts off his car. Waits, breathing fast, as -- 
DRE (TO HIMSELF) Come on, come on, come -- 
THE POLICE CRUISER barrels around the corner -- SLAMS THE BRAKES! Two LAPD OFFICERS fling open their doors, guns leveled at Dre's car! 
Eyes wide, adrenaline coursing through his veins, chest heaving, Dre grits his teeth. He's stuck... and he knows it. 
LAPD OFFICER 1 (VIA LOUDSPEAKER) Driver! Put your hands out of your window where we can see them! Now! 
Dre complies, reaches his hands out of his window. 
The two officers carefully approach, guns at the ready. OFFICER 2 slaps the cuffs on Dre, regret immediately registering on his face as we -- 
SMASH CUT TO:

Nicole hops out of her car and hurries into -- 
115   INT. JAIL - VISITING AREA - DAY                             115 
Dre and NICOLE sit across from each other, Plexiglas between them, talking via phone receivers. 
NICOLE Anybody else been here to see you, your so-called friends at Death Row? 
DRE Nope. You're the only one I wanna see anyway. 
She surveys him, pain in his eyes. 
NICOLE 112 days? That doesn't even make sense. 
DRE Yeah, well... That's what happens when you violate your probation. 
They sit there, just being in the awkward, contrived moment. 
NICOLE You got one phone call and you called me? 
DRE `Cause you were right. Only other person that tells it to me like it is-- is my moms. So I know you care. 
She looks at him, nods, dabs at her wet eyes. 
DRE (CONT'D) I fucked up. But I've had a lot of time to think in here, and I promise you, things are gonna be different from now on. 
That lies there a minute. Then -- 
NICOLE You take care of yourself, Andre. 
She stands, heads away... And we see the reflexive disappointment on Dre's face before... 
116   INT. EAZY'S NORWALK HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                 116 
Tomica and Eazy lie in bed together. He stares at the ceiling, and she runs her hand soothingly down his arm. 
EAZY I feel like I don't know what I'm doin' anymore. I don't even know where the money's going. 
Tomica props herself up on her elbow, looks at him. 
TOMICA I can help, you know. Show me the files, the bills, the contracts. I know the business, I know how it all works. Let me look. Baby, if you're feelin' this way, Jerry's not doin' right by you. 
Eazy puts his arm around her, pulls her close. They both lie there a little longer, just breathing. 
EAZY Okay. After New York. Workin' on that International Distribution with Sony. Jerry don't know about that. I wanna keep it that way. 
Tomica nods, smiles. Encouraged he has a plan again. 
Jerry has the PAPERS on the counter for Eazy's signature. But something's different this time. Eazy doesn't just sign. Instead, he starts GATHERING the papers into a pile. 
JERRY Wait, aren't you gonna sign -- 
EAZY I'mma take these home with me. I'll sign 'em. Get'em back to you in a couple days. 
Jerry looks alarmed. 
JERRY But this is how we've always done it. You have a lot on your plate Eric, there's no need to add to it -- 
EAZY It's cool, Jerry. They're my bills, my checks. I mean look, my name's right there. 
Eazy grins at Jerry, points to his name on the checks. 
JERRY I just wish we could do it here. I don't want anything to get misplaced or lost -- 
EAZY Don't worry so much, Jerry. I can handle it. 
Eazy picks up the pile of papers and heads for the door. Jerry stares after him, visibly shaken -- 
123   INT. EAZY'S NORWALK HOUSE - NIGHT                           123 
Tomica watches on as Eazy finishes READING the immaculately- organized PAPERS she's laid out for him. He puts them down. 
TOMICA You had to know the truth sometime. Now you do. 
EAZY Cube tried to warn me. So did Dre. And I didn't listen. I fucked up. 
And we stay with Eazy a moment, reeling, pissed.... 
124   INT. JERRY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - LATER                        124 
Eazy walks into their familiar meeting place to find Jerry slumped at the table. 
JERRY Where the fuck have you been? I've been calling you -- 
Jerry glances down at the PAPERS in Eazy's hand, sees the flat look on Eazy's face... and gets it. 
JERRY (CONT'D) So what was it, the groupie? The executive assistant? Did she even go to college? Come on. You're smarter than that, Eric -- 
EAZY This ain't about Tomica, Jerry. It's about you. And you really gotta stop acting like you never did anything wrong. 
JERRY Look, I know you're upset. But I'd strongly advise you to take a breath, let me look at the paperwork -- 
Eric lets out a low, rumbling laugh. 
EAZY Jerry, for real? You can stop givin' me advice. As of, like, now. I'm getting NWA back together. It's happening. But you ain't gonna have nothing to do with it this time. 
Jerry's voice starts to RAISE in volume, desperation growing. 
JERRY Why would you say something like that? You're not thinking straight. (MORE) 
JERRY (CONT'D) I know what's best for you, and for Ruthless, and we've built a trust over years of hard work. That trust is our foundation, Eric. 
Eazy laughs again, but this time... the laugh deteriorates into a ragged, hacking COUGH. Jerry watches, concerned -- 
JERRY (CONT'D) Are you okay? You don't look -- 
EAZY Trust. God damn, that's a word. Let me tell you somethin', Jerry. Trust is a muthafucka. 
Jerry is now full-on YELLING at Eric, who remains calm. 
JERRY Look, if what I've done is so illegal, why have I never been sued? I'm such a thief, such a liar, such a motherfucker, how come nobody's come to collect? This is business. This is how it works. It's not always pretty, but all of it, everything I've put into this company, my whole LIFE for all these years, it's for you, Eric. 
Eazy absorbs this. Then -- 
EAZY You're fired, Jerry. 
Jerry, who is now beet-red, starts to BELLOW with rage -- 
JERRY Goddammit, Eric! This is not how we do things! This is a business and I won't let you -- 
But Eazy's already out the door. Enraged, Jerry wipes his arm across the table sending everything SMASHING onto the floor! 
125   INT. DRE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY                          125 
Long gone are the days of the infamous Dr. Dre pool parties as Dre and Nicole relax by the pool. Dre's huge, early-model CELL PHONE rings from a table beside him. He picks it up -- 
DRE Hello? 
After a short pause, a familiar, gravelly voice comes on. 
EAZY'S VOICE Wassup Andre, it's Eric. 
Dre's eyes widen. Eazy's the last person he ever expected to hear from. 
DRE Yeah? Wassup wit you? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
126   INT. EAZY'S NORWALK HOUSE - BACK YARD - CONTINUOUS         126 
Chilling by his modest pool, Eazy looks worn but determined. 
EAZY Just felt like callin' -- 
Dre is still vaguely mystified, at a loss. 
DRE Yeah. Okay. (beat) Wassup? 
EAZY You know. Doin' my thing. Makin records. Killin' all that pussy out there. 
Seated a few feet away from Eazy, Tomica rolls her eyes.

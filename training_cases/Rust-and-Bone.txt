16TH August 2011 
1. THE CHILD Gradually more and more visible in the darkness, the face of a child, Sam. He is 6 years old, blond, pale and miserably thin. As we move in on his eyes, we see his lids quickly contracting. Under his eyelids: vestiges of the day's lights and shadows, of the day's noise. 
2. EXT. - NORTHWEST LANDSCAPES. DAY 
A grim region where the sky hangs low and the wind can knock a man off his feet. On the side of the highway, a large, muscular man with spiked blond hair: Ali Van Versh, 25. He has a big bag in one hand and a cell phone in the other. He talks on the phone as he continues walking: 
ALI It's me. It's Ali... I left. I took the kid with me. She can't take care of him anymore. I got into a fight with the guy she's with. I don't know where to go. What do I do with the kid? I can't talk. I don't have any more credit... Call me back! He hangs up quickly and turns to Sam. 
ALI Move it! His phone rings. He immediately answers. 
ALI Yeah! Where is it? Shit! It's so far! How do I get there? I don't know. Today or tomorrow. Yeah... Ali lifts Sam onto his shoulders with one arm. Sam is tiny, he looks like a squirrel on his father's back. 
3. INT. TRAIN.DAY 
There is a map of the French rail system near the toilets in a regional train. While Sam pees, Ali examines it. He follows the lines to plot out their trip. He arrives where France ends, at the Mediterranean. Sam comes out of the bathroom, straightening his pants. 
SAM I'm thirsty. 
ALI We don't have any money. 
SAM I'm thirsty! 
4. INT. TGV. DAY 
A different speed, different countryside. Ali notices a half-empty bottle of Evian water left on a tray. He takes it. He searches through the garbage under other empty seats. Ali and Sam eat leftover sandwiches and fruit, and finish off abandoned bottles of water. 
5. INT. TGV. DAY 
Another TGV. Rain evaporates off the windows. Ali has fallen asleep. He's too big for his seat. Sam watches the landscape go by and bangs his feet against his seat. Ali opens one eye. 
ALI Stop it. Sam's Mickey Mouse sandals pause, then go back to their banging. 
ALI I said to stop it. The sandals freeze. Cut. 
6. THE CHILD All of a sudden, Sam is asleep, his eyelids blinking quickly. 
7. EXT. CANNES STREET. DAY 
Ali's face is turned toward the orange heat of an afternoon sun. Ali and Sam look at the sea, the beaches and hotels. It's hot and beautiful. They walk by tanned people in shorts, short skirts, sandals... In their shapeless grey track pants, they look like hoboes. Ali drags his sport bag with one hand and Sam with the other. Ali is on the phone: 
ALI I don't know. A big street that started at the station. Yeah, by the beach. Behind? We just came from there! Ali pulls Sam away from one of the stairways that lead to the beach... 
SAM I'm tired. 
ALI So am I. He's coming to pick us up. Come on! Sam is extenuated. Ali has to heave him up onto a shoulder. 
8. EXT. CANNES STREET. DAY 
A four-lane avenue near the outskirts of town. Ali is walking on the shoulder of the road, with Sam piggy- back. A horn beeps. A refrigerated truck, blinking to get to the side of the road. The window rolls down to reveal a moustache and a cap: Richard. 
12. EXT. GARDEN. EVENING 
Evening is falling. At the back of the garden are a home- made pen and doghouse. Four puppies come running. Sam touches them through the chicken wire. 
ANNA You want to pet them? She lifts Sam up over the wire mesh. 
ANNA Careful. Don't step on their tiny paws. They're just babies. Anna shows him how to feed puppies, then stands back up. 
ANNA (to Ali) The breeder's picking them up next month. Brings in some money. Otherwise, Richard and I were thinking 300 a month for you and the kid... That okay? 
ALI Yeah. 
ANNA "Yeah" what? Is that too much? 
ALI It's not too much, but I don't have it. I had to pay for the train... 
ANNA So what are you going to do? 
ALI I don't know. Find a job. Whatever. 
ANNA Yeah, whatever... You think there's any work around here? You think there's any more here than there? Where has that ever been the case? When you told me you were coming down, 
I said we couldn't afford houseguests! 
ALI What should I have done with the kid? Where should I have gone? 
ANNA I have no idea, but if you stay here you have to pay your share, or else go somewhere else. As far as we're concerned, it's easy: we can't! How long were you thinking of staying? 
ALI I don't know. She makes a tired gesture and goes back toward the house, calling Richard on the way. Ali hears Sam in the kennel, giggling in delight. He looks around: the seedy garden, a metal shed leaning to one side, what's left of an engine, an old, orange Special 50 moped, plastic junk, etc. Overhead, a plane descends on Nice, its landing lights shining. 
13. INT. BASEMENT. NIGHT 
In the cluttered basement, Sam is rolled up in a sleeping bag arranged on a pallet and watches his father repair the antique Special 50 moped by the light of a flashlight. 
14. INT. ELECTRONIC GOODS SHOP. DAY 
Ali wanders through an electronic goods shop, pretending to be interested in cameras. Through the shop window, he can see Sam waiting outside in the sun. 
15. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY 
Suddenly, Sam sees his father run out of the shop, trying to shake a security guard hot on his tail. Sam watches them disappear into a tiny lane. Sam looks around a bit frightened. 
Farther off, in a busy shopping districtâ¦ Ali forces his way through hordes of tourists. The security guard grabs him by the hood and forces him up against a wall. They are both dripping with sweat and out of breath. 
SECURITY GUARD Unzip your jacket! Empty your pockets! Ali keeps his cool. 
ALI Unzip it yourself! Ali struggles free and smiles at the guy invitingly. The guard tries to punch him. Ali dodges: The guard hesitates a moment, until Ali lets fly a right hook. The guard stumbles. A kick in the face sends him flying into a stall. Ali lifts his arms in victory for the benefit of the few, stunned passersby. He kisses his own biceps, does three steps of a moonwalk and saunters off. 
16. EXT. ANTIBES STREETS. DAY 
Sam is walking along the street by the beach amid the terraces and ice-cream stores, looking for his father. Then he sees the moped at the far side of the parking lot where they had left it chained up. He walks toward it. A voice calls out. 
ALI Hey! Here I am! Ali crosses the street and kneels down in front of Sam who is sniffling, tears in his eyes. 
ALI No need to cry. I wouldn't have left you all alone. Ali unlocks the moped. 
17. EXT. ALLEYWAY. DAY 
In a small side street, Sam watches Ali sell a camera for a few 20 Euro notes. 
OWNER Drink? He shakes his head "no". The boss notes something in a file. 
20. INT. ALTA SECURITY OFFICE. DAY. 
Anna and Sam are waiting outside the office. The owner kisses Anna on the cheek. He asks how Richard is doing, then shows them to the door. Anna looks proud to know him. 
21. EXT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT 
Saturday evening. The door to the Fever Ray night club. Patrons wait, bouncers pick and choose. An imposing Caucasian maneuvers the red rope. Behind him, Ali Van Versch and Foued Latahoui, who looks like a lightweight boxer, guard the door. Ali wears a faded blue "ALTA Secu" jacket and stiff, matching pants. Looking well-groomed, Foued is wearing a white shirt and tie. Well-groomed. A group of girls passes through the security barrier. Foued acts like he's hesitating: 
FOUED Okay, I'll let you through because I'm outnumbered. Four against one, I don't stand a chance! The girls smile and disappear inside. Ali watches them vanish. 
FOUED You say something nice, anything. That way, when they leave, they remember you and you can hit on them. If they're a little plastered, if things didn't go too well for them, you're there with a nice thing to say... 
ALI And it works? 
FOUED Sometimes. But you can't be dressed like that. Like a parking lot attendant... They are interrupted by the bouncer. 
THE CAUCASIAN (pointing) Fight! They go running. Three guys are fighting like savages. Ali and Foued clean house. Foued gets rid of gawkers. Ali delivers a few random punches, lifts one of the guys off 
his feet and grabs another by the collar. While Foued chases the rowdy men toward the parking lot, Ali helps a girl back to her feet. She's a pretty blond, must be about 27 or 28, who has taken a punch in the face. It is Stephanie. 
ALI Are you okay? Breathe out of your mouth. In and out. Put your head back. Walk a little. Walk and breathe... He demonstrates how and takes her by the arm, forcing her to walk. She looks groggy. 
STEPHANIE I have to go home... 
ALI You have friends here? 
STEPHANIE No, I came alone. I have my car in the lot. I'll be fine. 
ALI You can't drive like that. 
STEPHANIE I'm fine. I'm fine, I said. Thanks. 
ALI You can't drive like that. I'll call you a cab. 
STEPHANIE How do I get my car afterwards? Seriously, I'll be fine. Trust me! We hear a voice from the parking lot. 
ANGRY MAN Bitch! Stephanie looks back. 
ANGRY MAN Yeah... you, you cunt. Bitch! She ignores him, pretending not to see him. She then notices the blood stains on her T-shirt. 
STEPHANIE Shit. 
ALI Where's your car? 
22. INT. STEPHANIE'S CAR. NIGHT 
Ali drives. His head seems to touch the roof of the little Fiat and his thighs are too thick for the seat. He glances over at Stephanie. 
ALI Still bleeding? Keep your head back. Wait... He manipulates the knob to push her seat back. He grimaces in pain. 
ALI Shit! 
STEPHANIE Did you hurt yourself? He shows her his right wrist. 
STEPHANIE It's swelling up. He rests his hand on the wheel. After a beat: 
ALI You often go to the Fever? 
STEPHANIE (embarrassed) Someone's up there. 
ALI So what? 
STEPHANIE Wait here. I'll be right back. She takes a few steps, fumbling for her keys. She hesitates, then looks back. 
STEPHANIE Okay, come on up. 
24. INT. SIMON & STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. NIGHT 
They enter the apartment. The light is on. Simon comes out of the bedroom in his boxer shorts and a T-shirt. He's thirty, blond, and there is something commanding about his look that could be thought to resemble Stephanie's. He discovers Ali and the blood stains on Stephanie's T- 
SHIRT: 
SIMON What the hell? What's going on? 
STEPHANIE Nothing. A fight... 
SIMON Are you okay? 
STEPHANIE Yeah, I'm fine. 
SIMON (pointing to Ali) Who's he? 
STEPHANIE The bouncer from the Fever. He drove me home. 
ALI (introducing himself)... Ali. 
SIMON The Fever? What the hell were you doing there? Ali opens the refrigerator. 
SIMON What are you looking for? 
ALI Ice cubes. 
STEPHANIE He hurt his hand... Simon pulls Stephanie into the bedroom. Ice cubes in a Plexiglas salad bowl. Ali's hand in the bowl. He looks around. There are photos on the wall: Stephanie surfing on the back of a killer whale, Stephanie posing with a group of young people in diving suits in front of the Marineland logo, Stephanie rising out of the water on Niska's rostrum, etc. From the nearby bedroom, he hears snatches of Simon's 
REPROACHES: 
SIMON (OFF) If you decide to go out, call me. That's all! Who were you with there? 
STEPHANIE (OFF) Philippe and Christine. 
SIMON (OFF) I thought you went out to dinner. 
STEPHANIE (OFF) We decided to go out for a drink after. 
SIMON (OFF) You get my text messages? Why didn't you answer me? Stephanie comes back into the kitchen. She has changed her T-shirt. She seems tense. 
STEPHANIE Feeling better? 
ALI Is that you in the picture with the orcas? 
STEPHANIE Not orcas. Just one orca. Her name is Niska. 
ALI Is that your job? 
STEPHANIE Yep... Ali nods vaguely admiringly. 
ALI Fuck... I didn't think that... 
GILLES They were a part of you. When a man dies, he gets buried. There's a ceremony, a prayer... Now a piece of you ended up in a hospital trashcan without a prayer, without any time for meditation. A beat. She is dumbstruck. She cannot believe what she's hearing. In the backseat, Raphael exhales some smoke into Julia's open mouth. GILLES (cont'd) You have to think about it symbolically... 
STEPHANIE Yeah, it's really symbolic... 
GILLES I know where my arm is. We buried it under a nice oak tree behind my house in the scrubland. My wife and kids came and we sang... Stephanie has a fit of the giggles. 
GILLES (a bit vexed) You think I'm kidding? 
STEPHANIE No, it's the grass. I'll stop... She laughs so hard she cries. 
RAPHAEL Shit, it's a laugh riot up there. (to Gilles) Can you take us home? She looks back and, between the seats, notices the girl toying with Raphael's fly. 
GILLES I'm too beat. I'll take a nap, then go. (to Stephanie) How are you getting home? 
40. EXT/INT. HYPERBRICO. NIGHT 
A HyperBrico DIY store in an industrial zone in Cannes. Its windows shine in the night like an aquarium. 
41. INT. HYPERBRICO. NIGHT 
Ali and Kadhi, a huge guard accompanied by a dog, make their rounds. They open doors with a magnetic key, each time recording their passage on electronic terminals. A bit before midnight, someone knocks at the main entrance. Ali goes to look. It's a guy in a leather jacket and baseball cap, with a backpack and a shoulder bag. 
ALI What do you want? 
MARTIAL To come in. The guy takes out a card and presses it against the glass door: it's the business card of ALTA SECU, the security agency. 
ALI Hey, Kadhi, come here! Kadhi comes over and looks at the guy. 
KADHI Okay, okay... Are you Martial? 
MARTIAL Yeah. 
KADHI Give me your keys. 
ALI Who's he? 
KADHI It's fine. The boss told me he was coming. He works for the company. Ali hands him the bunch of keys. 
42. INT. HYPERBRICO - AISLES. NIGHT 
Ali goes down an aisle looking for something and finally finds what he was looking for: a folding ladder. 
43. INT. HYPERBRICO - STOCK ROOM. NIGHT 
Martial has spread out his material in a stock room at the back of the store at the end of a corridor formed by palettes: precision tools, drills, electronic mini-cameras still in their wrapping, cases equipped with antennae, packs of batteries... A small radio is playing a night program on Radio Monte Carlo. Equipped with a small headlamp, Martial carefully cuts a hole in a cardboard box with his Leatherman scissors. He conceals a tiny camera inside. 
Ali arrives with the ladder over his shoulder. 
ALI Will this do? 
MARTIAL Perfect. Put it down there. Martial climbs the ladder to place the box high on a shelf. 
MARTIAL Imagine you're the manager of a big store like this and the union reps have been busting your balls. What do you do? 
ALI Fire them. 
MARTIAL You think that's how it works? What do you do before you fire them? He checks to make sure the lens is aligned with the hole, then checks the screen and reception on a small pocket monitor. 
MARTIAL Well, beforehand you try to see how long they spend in the restroom, if they take extra-long coffee breaks, smoke on the premises, steal from the stockroom, rip customers off with the sales receipts... When you know all that, you put the pressure on them and you fire the ones who don't leave. Can you give me a stroll down the aisle? 
The door opens automatically. He is surprised. He hears a tired voice from inside. 
STEPHANIE (OFF) Come in. She is waiting in her wheelchair, holding the remote control. She activates it and the door closes behind Ali. Her hair is mid-length, her face has thickened and there are bags under her eyes. She is wearing a baggy Nike T- shirt with burn marks here and there and a pajama bottom whose legs hang limp. 
STEPHANIE Have you been waiting long? 
ALI No... I just got here. 
STEPHANIE Was that you who rang before? She looks exhausted but feverish. 
ALI No. 
STEPHANIE Come in. Sit down. He sits down on a small couch. 
STEPHANIE Want something to drink? A coffee? 
ALI Yes. 
STEPHANIE I only have instant. 
ALI That's fine. It takes two tries to activate the wheels on her wheelchair. 
ALI Need any help? She answers with a growl, as much for him as for her wheelchair, then goes into the kitchen. He sees her pajama legs flap like rags, he hears the noise of the tap. 
ALI Have you been living here long? 
STEPHANIE I don't know... Three or four months. 
ALI (looking around)... It's nice. She comes back. 
ALI Are you alone? You got no one to help you? 
STEPHANIE Help me what? Walk? 
ALI No, for the cleaning and everything... 
STEPHANIE Yeah there are people. They come and go. Hold on. She manages to navigate from the living room into her bedroom. He stays in the living room. He hears a kettle whistle in the kitchen. He goes into the kitchen and pours water into the glass/mug. He finds her hunched over in her 
wheelchair. She is nodding off, high on her medication. 
ALI Hey, are you okay? 
STEPHANIE I'm fine. He opens the window. 
STEPHANIE Does it stink here? 
ALI Yeah, a little. 
STEPHANIE It's me. He opens the curtains and looks outside. It is getting hot out. The automatic sprinklers have gone on. 
ALI Let's go out. (No answer) Hey, you hear me? 
STEPHANIE Yes. 
ALI Let's go out. 
STEPHANIE No. 
ALI Get dressed. 
STEPHANIE Don't let me go! Not right away... Do it gently. She feels unsure of herself. He lets go of her gradually. She starts to sink, then crawls forward, with power and grace. She stops but has to paddle like a dog to tread water. He joins her. She grabs onto him. 
ALI So? 
STEPHANIE I can't stop. If I do, I sink. Wait... She gesticulates... 
STEPHANIE This is bothering me! She takes off her T-shirt and hands it to him. Her breasts press against Ali's chest. 
STEPHANIE Okay, you can let go. She lets herself go and crawls like a pro. He stays put, holding her t-shirt. Twenty-five meters later, her head emerges. He hears a burst of laughter. Half asleep in a deck chair, he looks up from time to time to see how she's doing. She calls out to him. She is sitting in the water. She motions for him to come and get her. He helps her out and takes her into his arms. She hangs on to him, still out of breath. 
ALI You swim like a real pro!... She shuts her eyes. 
STEPHANIE Fuck that's good! The beach is crowded now. Ali carries her back to the deck chairs. Some bathers watch them go by, others look away. They are stretched out in their chairs. She has wrapped her lower body in a beach towel. They sunbathe. 
STEPHANIE Thanks. 
ALI Huh? 
STEPHANIE Thanks. 
She rolls onto her back. He sees her breasts pointed heavenward. 
51. INT. GYM. DAY 
A decrepit, simple, functional, but reasonably clean workout room. Guys of every color work the punching bags, lift weights, do chin-ups... From the gym next door, we hear the booming music of an aerobics class. In a small ring at floor level, Ali and Foued, loaded down with protective gear, pound each other. Each of their blows lands right on target. They repeat the same series of moves several times at varying speeds. 
52. INT. GYM - CORRIDOR. DAY 
Ali and Foued are dripping wet. They have towels around their necks. They fill their small plastic bottles at a faucet in the workout room. Through a large window in the corridor, Ali watches the aerobic class going on in the gym: legs and feet moving in rhythm, red faces, sweaty underarms, butts, boobs and the braid of the instructor, who uses it to beat the measure, as she swings it from one shoulder to the other. 
FOUED I have to get back. I need to train. Ali nods, without actually looking at him. 
53. EXT. GYM - STREET. DAY 
Outside, Ali has unwrapped the sandwich his sister had prepared for him. A bit farther off, the aerobics instructor is smoking in the sun. She has a short, buff body. She smokes her cigarette like someone who counts them out sparingly. They remain like that a while, he chewing ands she smoking. 
CUT TO 
54. INT. GYM - EQUIPMENT ROOM. DAY 
A cell phone vibrates. Through a narrow transom, a ray of sun slices through the dark equipment room. They haven't bothered undressing. Ali and the aerobics instructor are making love on a pile of workout mats. Ali's cell phone continues to vibrate, goes silent, vibrates again. He answers. We hear a crackling voice. 
ALI I'm still at the gym. I'm leaving... I said I'm leaving! He hangs up. They continue. 
55. EXT. NUSERY SCHOOL - SCHOOLYARD. DAY 
Sam is playing alone, perched up on monkey bars in the schoolyard. Through a wide window, he sees his father racing down a corridor that runs alongside the schoolyard. The principal is waiting for him at the door. Ali spurts out some quick apologies. Sam slowly slides off the structure. We hear the noise of his hands skidding on metal. 
56. EXT ANTIBES EVENING The moped wheezes and sputters. Ali and Sam are heading back home along the beach. Ali is so big, the moped looks like a kid's bike. Behind him on the luggage rack, he can feel Sam leaning into him. Sam's hand rummages in his coat pocket for a box of Choco-BN cookies. Ali takes one too. To their left, a train noisily speeds by. 
57. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. DAY 
Louise has a set of keys. She enters Stephanie's apartment with the mail. 
LOUISE Steph! Made up and well-groomed, she looks older than she actually is. Stephanie answers from the bathroom. 
STEPHANIE (OFF) I'm in here! Louise puts the mail on the living room table and enters the bedroom. Stephanie wheels herself out of the bathroom, her hair wet and her body wrapped in a towel. 
LOUISE Shit, you're not ready! The appointment is in a half hour! 
In close up on the screen of a small DVD player: amateur images of two bare-chested guys fighting in the garden of a suburban house. It looks like a wild boxing match, free- for-all vale tudo in which anything goes. In the Bricorama security room, Ali, Kadhi and Martial, excited, are bent over the screen. A few blows to the face have one of the combatants KO on the lawn. 
KADHI Look at the next one! Watch how he whacks him. A change of scene on the small screen: a courtyard between two tower blocks, with new combatants, but with the same amateur images and the same violence. 
KADHI (pointing to the screen)... I know him. I fought him twice in Nationals. He's not bad. He was at the boxing club in Marseille. Martial watches Ali, fascinated by the images, as if he were sizing him up. 
62. INT. PROJECTS. DAY 
An apartment in a Golfe Juan housing project. After-dinner time. Kids are playing, women doing the dishes. On the living room couch, under a tapestry of a lion hunt in Technicolor, Martial blows on his glass of tea. His 
cousin is sitting across from him. Ali is on a stool at the end of the table. 
MARTIAL He says he's done Thai boxing. He can fight. He's enormous. He's not afraid of taking punches, and he's white. 
COUSIN I see. The cousin turns to Ali. He takes his time sizing him up. 
COUSIN Is that true? You like to fight? 
ALI Yeah. 
COUSIN Okay, so I organize the fights. I pick the fighters. I see if the money's there. I ref. I collect the dough... I take a third of the bets. The rest goes to the winner... 
MARTIAL A third of how much? 
COUSIN We don't fight for less than 800. Ali does the division in his head. 
MARTIAL So? Ali hesitates. 
ALI (to Martial) There's something I don't get: how much do you take? 
MARTIAL I don't know. You tell me. How much do you need? I'll take 20% of what you win. How's that? 
ALI And how much does your cousin give you? 
MARTIAL Oh, I introduced you to him, didn't I? How's that? 
ALI Okay. The cousin stands up. They all shake on it. 
63. INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY 
Ali is in a corner of the living room, sitting in front of Anna's old PC and watching some fight videos he's found. Anna rushes into the room. 
ANNA Keep Sam with you for 5 minutes! She hurries to find some papers in the drawer of a commode. Ali hasn't budged. 
ANNA Oh! Hear me? I don't want your son in the garden. 
ALI Yeah, I heard. He gets up and goes to get Sam who is playing behind the house. Anna finds her papers and leaves in another direction. 
ALI Sam! Come here! I want to show you some stuff! He lifts Sam up with one arm and goes back to the computer. 
ALI Look how they fight... He clicks on an image and the fight continues... the audience's noise as well. Sam watches, intrigued. Ali 
commentates, pointing to guys onscreen. 
ALI Look at him, in red. See how strong he is? 
SAM Is he the good guy? 
ALI No, he's the bad guy. Look how he tries to grab his legs. Wait. His phone vibrates. He takes it from his pocket. It's Martial. He answers. 
STEPHANIE And you're not scared? 
ALI Of what? 
STEPHANIE How much do they pay you for this? 
ALI I don't know. About 500, 1000 maybe. 
STEPHANIE You're doing that for 500 euros? 
ALI Um, yeah. 
STEPHANIE You're going to get whacked on the face and risk your health for 500 euros? 
ALI Risk my health? What are you talking about? Why are you getting so worked up? 
STEPHANIE I'll give you the 500! Cancel it and I'll give it to you tomorrow. 
ALI You can give it to me if you have too much money, but I said I was doing it and I am. That's all. 
STEPHANIE If it's not for money, why then? 
ALI I didn't say it's not for the money! 
STEPHANIE Why are you doing it? 
ALI Oh, stop driving me crazy! I'm doing it to fight. For fun. Why did you clown around on your fish? For the fun of it, right? She grins. 
STEPHANIE Yeah and look how I ended up. 
ALI Spare me. You turn on the waterworks when you feel like it. 
She dries her eyes. He begins to pack things up. 
STEPHANIE Your fight, if you do it... 
ALI Mm? 
STEPHANIE You think I can come along? 
67. EXT/INT. MARTIAL'S MERCEDES. DAY 
A narrow road. Down below, a town. The Mercedes Vito with the tinted windows lifts a cloud of dust. Stephanie is in the back seat and has to hold on to the overhead strap to avoid hurting herself. At the end of the road is a gate guarded by two huge homies. They signal Martial to over. He rolls down his window and the two homies peer inside. They see Ali and Stephanie in the back. 
HOMEBOY 1 Who's she? 
MARTIAL His girlfriend. Surprised, Stephanie looks at Ali, watching for his reaction. He looks elsewhere. The gate opens. Martial drives in. 
68. EXT / INT. MARTIAL'S MERCEDES. DAY 
Ali and Stephanie are alone in the car. Through the tinted windows, they can see a concrete yard with boats dry-docked around it and buildings with satellite dishes studding every balcony. Some men are over in one corner, discussing: Martial, his cousin and some other mean looking guys. In the shade, a bit to one side and surrounded by his fans, is a bare-chested, muscle-bound North African. He warms up, 
wagging his head from left to right. 
ALI (under his breath) Motherfucker's acting like he's on Canal Plus. 
STEPHANIE Who are the other guys? 
ALI I don't know. Guys with money. Dealers. A beat. 
STEPHANIE What do you want to know? If I knew him before the accident? Martial looks back. 
MARTIAL What? 
STEPHANIE You find it weird that we're together? You wonder what he's doing with me? 
MARTIAL No, since you know him, I just wanted to know if you've seen him like that before? 
STEPHANIE No. Martial finishes counting the bills. 
MARTIAL He freaks me out. He takes his share and hands Stephanie the envelope. 
MARTIAL 1200 for him. She looks at the envelope without taking it. 
STEPHANIE Why are you giving me that? 
MARTIAL It's for Ali. 
STEPHANIE Exactly. So why give it to me? He looks at her, suddenly surprised. 
MARTIAL Hey, you make it complicated. Either you take it or you don't. And either I talk or I keep my mouth shut. He tosses the envelope at her. She looks away. Ali finally gets back into the car with a big box. It's a toy: a green John Deere tractor with all the accessories. 
ALI For my kid. 
STEPHANIE You have a kid? 
ALI Yep. 
74. EXT. BEACH - ROAD. DAY 
The afternoon sun has the entire coast sparkling. Ali is on his moped, with the box between his knees, driving up the coastal road. He looks splendid, wearing new clothes. He finally sees what he was looking for: a group on the beach, Anna, Richard and their neighbors, having a picnic. 
CUT TO: 
75. EXT. BEACH. DAY 
CU Ali and Anna are off to one side, talking. 
ANNA You see what you're like with him? You're not around and when you are, you scream at him. Damn, you hit him! Why did you take him along if you act like that? You should have left him. 
ALI Cut the shit. He's not dead. I didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry about it. Anna avoids his glance. He rummages in his pocket, pulls out the envelope of money and hands it to her. 
ALI Here. 
ANNA What's that? 
ALI Money. What I owe you plus the next few 
months. You can count it. She looks at the bills. 
ANNA Where did you get this? (pointing to his new clothes) Same place? 
ALI I won a fight. 
ANNA A fight? What kind of fight? Is that the only job you could find? Is that why you have marks on your face? 
ALI Hey, will you take the money or not? Why are you looking at me that way? 
ANNA Nothing. He leaves her with the envelope and trots over to the rest of the group. They are packing away ice chests and folding things up. Sam and his little friends are playing in the sand with the John Deere tractor. Sam has a bandage on his forehead. Ali sits down in the sand next to him. 
MARTIAL I'll have my company pay you and I'll bill them what you cost me. They'll keep paying you but now you'll work directly for me. You won't have to spend your nights there. There is some movement on the screen. He interrupts himself. Gray silhouettes cross the screen, open a door and disappear before coming back to cross the screen once again. 
ALI Where's that? 
MARTIAL At the Mousquetaires. Martial rewinds and zooms in on some faces. 
MARTIAL I'll make a copy and you'll take it to the 
owner. Ask for Steve at Security. He'll tell you what to do. 
80. INT. RICHARD'S TRUCK. DAY 
Sam is on Richard's lap, âdriving' the truck. He is in seventh heaven. In front of them, a man is running down the shoulder of the road. 
RICHARD Look who it is! Go on, honk! 
81. EXT. ROAD. DAY 
The horn beeps. Out of breath, in a sweat, Ali looks back and sees Richard and Sam in the truck. They slow down and pull up to him. Richard lowers his window. 
RICHARD We're going to school. Want to come along? Ali shakes his head and continues jogging. The truck disappears. 
82. INT. NEW GYM. DAY 
This new gym is large, clean and light. In one corner there is a genuine ring, and on the other side, a piece of tatami. Ali is working out with Joao, a Brazilian in a kimono. They try out some foot-fist series. On the mat, Ali shadows and deconstructs Joao's gestures. 
83. EXT. ANTIBES. STREET. DAY 
A street near the beach. The weekend is beginning. The streets are crowded. Ali is on the phone. 
ALI Where are you? I can't see you. Where? He looks every which way until he sees her, a few feet away. She is standing upright, in a light pair of pants, with her canes hidden behind her back. It takes some time to register. She smiles at him. 
ALI That's fucking amazing! I was looking for a wheelchair... 
STEPHANIE Stop looking. No more wheelchairs! 
ALI Since when? 
STEPHANIE Two days. 
ALI You could have told me! 
STEPHANIE Why? Is it a problem? 
ALI No, I don't know. You're like before. 
STEPHANIE Well, not exactly. 
ALI Go on, let's see. She takes a few steps forward, leaning on her canes. He whistles in admiration. 
STEPHANIE I need to get my balance but supposedly that doesn't take long. 
ALI It must be like walking on stilts... 
STEPHANIE I don't know. I've never walked on stilts before. 
ALI You look taller. Does it hurt? 
STEPHANIE A little, but it feels good too. 
STEPHANIE Okay, let's change the subject... She begins piling up plates and silverware. 
ALI You want to fuck? She is thrown for a loop. 
STEPHANIE Huh? 
ALI You want to know if it still works, so let's fuck and that way you'll know. He looks at her, simply, naturally. She has a nervous laugh. 
STEPHANIE Just like that? 
ALI Um, yeah. Give me that. He takes the plates, gets up and puts them in the dishwasher. 
STEPHANIE I... I don't know if I can like that... 
ALI Whatever you want... You tell me... She hesitates. 
STEPHANIE Wait. She wheels herself away from the table and into the bedroom. He remains alone, quickly cleaning the table. 
ALI What do I do? 
STEPHANIE (OFF) Wait! He waits. Then: 
STEPHANIE (OFF) Come here. 
85. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM. DAY 
He enters the room. The shutters are closed. She is in bed, under the covers. She watches him sit down on the bed, undo 
his pants and turn toward her. 
ALI Okay? Ready? Unsure of herself, she pulls a face. 
STEPHANIE Let's try. He slips under the covers, spontaneously tries to kiss her, but she pushes him away gently. 
STEPHANIE (a little nervous) Do you mind if we don't kiss? 
ALI No. Your breasts... can I? 
STEPHANIE Yes. He licks her breasts, then lies on top of her, covering her. She tries to wriggle herself free. 
STEPHANIE You're crushing me! 
ALI Maybe you should stop talking now... 
STEPHANIE Okay, I'll stop. His hands caress her, they grab onto what remains of her thighs. He enters her. She is about to scream, but lets herself go. She grabs hold of him. 
STEPHANIE Gently! 
86. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN. DAY 
Ali opens the fridge. He is dressed again. Stephanie appears in a robe, sitting in her wheelchair. We can tell she feels too shy to look at him. 
ALI Are you okay? How was it? She blushes. 
ALI Is it still working? 
STEPHANIE Um, yes... no... I don't really know. It's different... It's hard to tell after just one try... 
ALI Yeah but I don't have time right now. I have to go! 
HIM OFFÂ¦ 
101. INT. MARTIAL'S CAR. DAY 
The car is driving back into town. Martial is driving. The windows are open. Ali holds a bag of ice against his cheek bone, while Stephanie applies her Band-Aids to a cut over his eyebrows. They are talking, but we can not hear what they say. All we hear is the noise of the wind against the open windows. Ali suddenly breaks out laughing. Martial does too in the rear view mirror. Stephanie follows suitâ¦ 
102. INT. MOUSQUETAIRES. DAY 
Muzak. Ali and Martial follow the head of security into the store. Some of the personnel are near the cash registers, silent, hostile and immobile. The morning customers wonder what's happening. The head of security elbows his way through. 
HEAD OF SECURITY Let them through, please! The personnel reluctantly make way. 
103. INT. MOUSQUETAIRES - STOCKROOM. DAY 
Red graffiti on the wall: "A SPYING BOSS IS A CRIMINAL 
BOSS!" 
Ali recognizes the place with the palettes up to the ceiling. In the back, he also recognizes the manager, protected by two guards and being harangued by union representatives. 
MARTIAL (to Ali, pointing to the manager) Go get the equipment. I need to see him. Ali obeys. 
UNION REP Don't bother. We're the ones who will call the police. The police and the press. That way they'll know you spy on your workers! The manager looks away, accompanied by his two guards. 
UNION REP At least have the courage to look at me when I talk to you! 
CUT TO: The cameras, the ripped out cables, the phony boxes have been piled up on the floor. It looks more like the crime squad has been at work. Ali opens a garbage bag and bends over to retrieve the equipment. 
WOMAN (OFF) What are you doing there? She's a young employee in the store uniform. 
ALI (suspicious) Packing up. 
WOMAN Is it your stuff? 
ALI No. He notices that she's taken out her cell phone to take a picture. 
ALI Don't you take a picture! 
WOMAN You work for them? She continues to manipulate her phone. 
ALI I said no picture! 
WOMAN Why shouldn't I? You film us! He straightens up menacingly. 
ALI I'm going to slap you! A hand grabs his arm. It's Martial. 
MARTIAL Forget it. Let's get out of here! 
ALI And the equipment? 
MARTIAL Forget about it. We're fucked here. The cops are going to question the managers and the managers will turn us in. They leave. 
104. INT. MARTIAL'S FORMULE 1 ROOM. NIGHT 
Martial's fingers slowly play with the hair on his chest. He is lying nude on the bed of his Formule 1 hotel room. He smokes and stares at the ceiling. His suitcases and bags are packed, all he has to do is close them. He hears knocks next door. He gets up with a sigh, pulls on his pants and opens the door. Stephanie is waiting in front of room 429. 
MARTIAL In here. Stephanie looks back, surprised. Martial motions her in. 
MARTIAL I have to go away for work. 3 or 4 months, I don't know yet... Since Ali wants to keep fighting, I thought maybe you tend to that while I'm not here... She is thunderstruck. 
107. EXT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT 
The smoking area is located outside, and a bit farther off, the dope smoking area. Behind the smokers, we hear noise from the club. Cousin is puffing on a spliff. Stephanie watches, holding her champagne goblet. He offers it to her. She accepts and takes a drag. 
COUSIN Can I talk to you? She nods "yes". 
COUSIN There's something I'd like to know... The fish that ate your legs... She wasn't expecting that. 
STEPHANIE Yes? 
COUSIN Is it true it's still there? 
STEPHANIE Yeah... where else would it be? 
COUSIN They didn't shoot it? Or put it down, whatever? 
STEPHANIE Why would they do that? 
COUSIN I don't know... when a dog attacks you, they kill it. And the fish gets off. Don't you mind that the thing that ate your legs is living it up in its shitty fucking aquarium? 
STEPHANIE No. And I don't want anything to happen to it. Now more than ever! He looks at her, incredulous, but with admiration. 
COUSIN (imitating her) "Now more than ever". Listen to you! He takes another drag. 
COUSIN (imitating her) Tututu-tu-tutu... They laugh. 
STEPHANIE Do I sound like that? 
COUSIN Tututu... 
108. INT. FEVER RAY. NIGHT 
We are back inside. Ali is working on a girl a bit farther off on the dance floor. Stephanie follows Cousin through the noise and sticky heat. When she next looks at the dance floor, Ali is no longer there. Ali and the girl are on their way to the exit. Ali looks for a friendly face, meets Stephanie's glance and motions that he's leaving. She waves: "Yeah, ok, I get it." Ali disappears with the girl. Stephanie is at the bar, drinking. She types an SMS into her cell phone: "operational?" She hesitates, then puts 
away her cell phone. She hadn't noticed a guy sitting next to her. She also failed to notice that he's been speaking to her for a while now. 
STEPHANIE (loud) Huh? I can't hear you... 
GUY (loud) No problem. What are you drinking? 
STEPHANIE (loud) Champagne? The guy orders. He is blond, lean and athletic-looking. He might be thought to resemble Simon. 
GUY What's your name? I'm Pierre. 
STEPHANIE Hey there. I'm Marie. 
GUY Come here often? Stephanie is on automatic pilot. When she turns to the room, she feels the blond guy's eyes locked onto her. She can pretty much tell what he's thinking about the breasts under her T-shirt. She answers his questions, she returns his smiles. When she finishes her glass and puts it down on the counter, he kisses her. She doesn't push him away immediately, like a frightened virgin, she takes the time to put a good face on it. 
STEPHANIE No... No, please. I don't feel like it. Not tonight. I can't... The guy looks disappointed, then manages a âgood loser's' smile. 
GUY Okay, no problem... 
STEPHANIE It's best I go. Good night and thanks. 
He sees her lean over to retrieve her canes and then hobble away. 
GUY Sorry. I couldn't know. Stephanie freezes. 
STEPHANIE You couldn't know what? 
STEPHANIE We'll continue... but not like animals. He smirks, with a flick of the chin. 
STEPHANIE Cat got your tongue? Ali stirs his cup without answering. He feels her eyes on him. He smiles. 
ALI I'm oper now. 
STEPHANIE What? 
ALI You made me oper. It's you! It's because it's all you're talking about! 
STEPHANIE (softly) You are really a dog. He stands up. 
STEPHANIE What are you doing? 
ALI I'm getting out of here. 
STEPHANIE Why? 
ALI I'm fed up. 
STEPHANIE You're bored? 
ALI Yeah. 
STEPHANIE What I'm saying bores you? 
ALI Yeah. 
STEPHANIE Are you acting like a jackass on purpose? 
ALI Aren't you being an ass by putting words everywhere? He sits back down. She watches him eat his sandwiches. 
STEPHANIE I'm the one who's leaving. She gets up. Ali finishes his coffee. 
110. INT. TATTOO PARLOR. DAY 
The buzz of a small electric compressor. In extreme close up: the needle of a tattoo machine pricking skin. Ink flows, a cotton swab wipes... a tattoo slowly appears. Lying on a table, Stephanie is having what remains of her legs tattooed. 
CUT TO: 
111. EXT/INT. BANK. DAY 
Stephanie is at a teller's window, withdrawing a rather large amount of cash. A machine counts out the bills, while the employee stuffs wads of them into an envelope. 
112. EXT/INT USED CAR DEALERSHIP. DAY Pennants flap in the wind, the pennants of a used car dealership. CU: car doors opening, automatic gearboxes, Stephanie's "feet" testing pedals, bucket seats, backseats, tinted windows opening and closing, etc. 
113. INT. PROJECTS - APARTMENT. DAY 
A painting of a lion hunt and, under it, Stephanie and Cousin on a couch, talking shop. Leaning over a computer and a cell phone, they go over potential adversaries. Some kids stick their heads in to see what Stephanie looks like. 
114. INT. NEW GYM. DAY 
Foued, wearing protective gear, spars with a black cruiserweight. The fight is close, the sound of flesh on flesh resounds. Outside the ring, Ali cheers Foued on. He notices on the other side of the ring a young thin, bearded guy in a Lacoste polo shirt buttoned up to his neck - Leonardini - who is following the fight with the eye of a pro. When Ali and Joao are later working out on their bit of tatami, Ali sees Foued sitting on a bench, with a towel around his neck and talking with Leonardini. 
FOUED He saw me at la Ciotat. We spoke a few times on the phone. When he has it in for you, he never lets up. Leonardini is well-known. 
He was a club in Strasbourg with a training center. He's taking me on a trial basis for three months. If it works out, he'll make challenger in the nationals. 
115. INT. LOCKER ROOM - NEW GYM. DAY 
STEPHANIE Turn on the water when you pee. It's disgusting. He runs some water. 
119. INT. STEPHANIE'S APARTMENT. DAWN 
He carries her back into the bedroom. She looks at his face, the scar on his forehead, the scar over his nose. 
STEPHANIE How's your nose? 
ALI Mm. 
STEPHANIE It doesn't seem broken. 
ALI No. They look at each other. He puts her down on the bed and lies down next to her. Stephanie slides over to him. He lifts her up and places her on her stomach. They remain like that, without moving. She looks like a mermaid lolling on a rock. She leans over and kisses him on the mouth. He pulls away, surprised. 
ALI Now we're allowed? No answer. They make love. In CU: the tattoo on Stephanie's left thigh. A red and black arrow with, in industrial characters: "LEFT". 
120. EXT/INT. NISSAN SUV. DAY 
Music. 
The road speeds by. Sun. Road signs with the names of Italian cities. The landscape has changed. Wearing her baseball cap and sunglasses, Stephanie drives with her elbow out the window. On the radio, we hear the voice of an Italian DJ. 
121. EXT. COASTAL ROAD. DAY 
Ali jogs along the sea shore. He sweats, huffing and puffing. He stops, takes a few steps, then continues, but soon stops again. It looks as if his feet are weighing him down. Traffic speeds by. He stands still and stares into the near distance. Nothing. 
122. INT. TURIN - HOTEL. EVENING 
A standard hotel lobby. Curious, Stephanie looks at the crowd of fighters the day before the âUltimate' tournament: muscle-bound giants squeezed into tight jackets, with bashed in eyebrows, collapsed nostrils, cauliflower ears... Every language can be heard, some greet each other, some hug, they all size each other up... 
CUT TO: Propped up on her cane, she heads for a table in a corner of the bar where a man is consulting his cell phone. 
STEPHANIE (in German) Mr. Bower? 
GÃNTHER (in German) Yes? 
STEPHANIE (in German) I'm Stephanie Granget. GÃ¼nther looks about fifty and has obviously spent many of those years in the ring. 
CUT TO: 
Settled in a corner in front of their open PCs, Stephanie and GÃ¼nther talk shop. 
CUT TO: They are about to separate. 
STEPHANIE (in German) Can you get me a ticket for tonight? 
GÃNTHER (in German) I don't know. I'll see what I can do. (pointing to her legs) What happened to your legs? 
STEPHANIE An accident. In another life. I was an animal trainer. I worked with orcas... The show took a turn for the worse. 
GÃNTHER (it dawns on him) Oh, of course! In France! The accident! It was you?! I'm talking to a star! Stephanie makes a face. 
GÃNTHER Yes, I am... Amazing. What courage! Bravo! I'm very honored, really. I was an idiot before! 
STEPHANIE Why? 
GÃNTHER I acted like an arrogant business man. I'm so ashamed. Will you forgive me? 
STEPHANIE Of course, Mr. Bower. 
SAM No, they're skating. 
ALI They're skiing, I said! 
SAM Skating. A few steps on: 
ALI Skiing. 
SAM You're annoying me. They take a break at a picnic area, where they eat some sandwiches and drink orange soda. 
ALI (his mouth full) Does Auntie still have dogs? 
SAM No, now it's chickens. 
ALI In the garden? 
SAM Yeah, in the cage. They lay eggs. 
ALI That's good. 
SAM But Auntie doesn't want me to take the chicks in my room. 
ALI She's right. They're disgusting. (pointing to his sandwich) Finished? You want some 
applesauce? Afternoon. On the way back, they find a frozen pond. Ali carefully advances on the ice. He tests it. Jumps on it. Then he lets himself go and glides across the ice. 
ALI You can go. But not too far! Sam starts slipping and sliding. He falls down. He lies on the sled and lets it glide. Ali pees behind a tree. Sam is far away. 
ALI Come on, we have to head back! 
SAM 5 minutes. 
ALI Now! 
SAM (showing his fingers) 5 minutes! 
ALI 5 minutes. And then suddenly, instead of gliding, the child sinks. He tries to climb out and sinks again. A thin layer of ice is forming over him. 
SAM Daddy! Daddy! 
ALI Shit! Ali rushes to the pond, but Sam is already iced over. He kneels down and then crawls on his stomach toward the hole. Sam has disappeared. Ali shoves aside snow. He looks everywhere, but sees nothing. And then he hears a noise, blows like signals coming from under the ice. Ali crawls 
over and clears away snow as best he can. Under the ice, he sees Sam's face, staring wide-eyed. Ali begins to pound both his fists on the ice, like pistons or pestles... As if pounding on his punching bag. 
139. UNDER THE ICE. DAY Underwater, we hear the sound of dull thuds. Sam sees his father's fists pound on the ice. He sees bloodstains. The ice cracks, a bloody fist searches the water for him. Sam closes his eyes. 
140. EXT. POND. EVENING 
Evening is falling. Ali has stretched Sam out on the rim of the pond. The child has turned blue. He tries mouth-to- mouth resuscitation, he massages his heart and rubs him down. 
141. EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. EVENING 
Ali's respiration has become a grunt, then a groan. He runs. He has stowed Sam behind the front of his parka and runs as fast as he can. He slips, gets back up and runs again... he again breathes into Sam's mouth... while still running... 
142. INT. STRASBOURG - HOSPITAL - ICU. DAY 
Leaning against the window of the Intensive Care Unit, Ali sees Sam's nude, tiny body being worked on by doctors... his skin is blue from the cold... there is a tube in his mouth... his ribs rise and fall to the rhythm of a respirator... his mouth spits out brackish water brutally... A door opens and a nurse appears. Ali straightens up. 
NURSE We'll take care of you. Come with me. He doesn't understand. Then he notices the blood prints his hands have left on the ICU window. He looks at his scarred fingers, his broken, bloodied hands.

CASINO 
By 
Nicholas Pileggi 
EXT. RESTAURANT PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS, 1983 - DAY 
SAM 'ACE' ROTHSTEIN, a tall, lean, immaculately dressed man approaches his car, opens the door, and gets inside to turn on the ignition. 
ACE (V.O.) When you love someone, you've gotta trust them. There's no other way. You've got to give them the key to everything that's yours.  Otherwise, what's the point? And, for a while... I believed that's the kind of love I had. 
Suddenly, the car explodes. Flames, smoke and metal rise into the sky covering the view of the Las Vegas casinos and their signs. 
Music in: J.S. Bach - 'St Matthew Passion'. 
Ace's body comes flying in - extreme slow motion. His body twists and turns through the frame like a soul about to tumble into the flames of damnation. 
MAIN TITLE SEQUENCE. 
INT. TANGIERS CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT 
Vignette of ACE through rippling flames, we move in on ACE ROTHSTEIN overseeing the casino. He lights a cigarette. 
ACE (V.O.) Before I ever ran a casino or got myself blown up, Ace Rothstein was a hell of a handicapper, I can tell you that. I was so good, that whenever I bet, I could change the odds for every bookmaker in the country. I'm serious. I had it down so cold that I was given paradise on earth. I was given one of the biggest casinos in Las Vegas to run, the Tangiers... 
INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT 
Vignette of MOB BOSSES sitting at a table surrounded by food and wine like the gods of Olympus. 
ACE (V.O.) ...by the only kind of guys that can actually get you that kind of money: sixty-two million, seven-hundred thousand dollars. I don't know all the details. 
NICKY (V.O.) Matter of fact... 
INT. BAR, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT 
Vignette of NICKY SANTORO standing at a bar with DOMINICK SANTORO, his brother, and FRANK MARINO, his right-hand man. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...nobody knew all the details, but it should'a been perfect. I mean, he had me, Nicky Santoro, his best friend, watching his ass... 
INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 
Vignette of GINGER MCKENNA a dazzling thirty-one-year-old blonde seated by a small fiery pool. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...and he had Ginger, the woman he loved, on his arm.  But in the end... 
INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACE'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
ACE looks over the casino he rules. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...we fucked it all up. It should'a been so sweet, too.  But it turned out to be the last time that street guys like us were ever given anything that fuckin' valuable again. 
EXT. LAS VEGAS - NIGHT 
Aerial shot coming down out of the clouds over the brightly lit Vegas Strip and off into the blackness of the desert night. 
ACE (V.O.) At that time, Vegas was a place where millions of suckers flew in every year on their own nickel, and left behind about a billion dollars. But at night, you couldn't see the desert that surrounds Las Vegas... 
EXT. DESERT - DAWN 
Aerial shot swooping along the desert floor, then rising above the mist to reveal mountains in the distance. 
ACE (V.O.) But it's in the desert where lots of the town's problems are solved. 
NICKY (V.O.) Got a lot of holes in the desert, and a lot of problems are buried in those holes. Except you gotta do it right. I mean, you gotta have the hole already dug before you show up with a package in the trunk. Otherwise you're talkin' about a half-hour or forty-five minutes of diggin'. And who knows who's gonna be comin' along in that time? Before you know it, you gotta dig a few more holes. You could be there all fuckin' night. 
EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP, 1973 - NIGHT 
TITLE IN: 'THE STRIP', 'LAS VEGAS', 'TEN YEARS EARLIER' 
ACE is greeted by a casino exec and walked through the brightly lit entrance to the Tangiers Casino. 
ACE (V.O.) Who could resist? Anywhere else in the country, I was a bookie, a gambler, always lookin' over my shoulder, hassled by cops, day and night. But here, I'm 'Mr Sam Rothstein'. I'm not only legitimate, but running a casino. And that's like selling dreams for cash. 
INT. TANGIERS CASINO - NIGHT 
We see ACE enter alone. He is greeted by BILLY SHERBERT. They are joined by top executives RICHIE and RONNIE in suits and ties. They walk through the casino, past crowded and noisy craps tables, spinning roulette wheels, blackjack tables, poker-faced players at poker tables, and elegant, cordoned-off, black-tie, baccarat tables. 
ACE (V.O.) I hired an old casino pal, Billy Sherbert, as my manager and I went to work. 
SHERBERT (Introducing the EXECS to ACE) ...And this is Ronnie, who takes care of the card room... 
ACE (V.O.) For guys like me, Las Vegas washes away your sins. It's a morality car wash. It does for us what Lourdes does for humpbacks and cripples. And, along with making us legit... 
INT. TANGIERS/HARD COUNT ROOM - NIGHT 
Dolly back from a wall of money. An employee pours a bucket full of coins into a trough. Camera follows progress as numerous coins move on a conveyor system, through a sorting machine. Camera reveals several rolls of coins on a lower conveyor as they move up a ladder towards an employee's hands, who then places the rolls on a rack. 
ACE (V.O.) ...comes cash. Tons of it. I mean, what do you think we're doing out here in the middle of the desert? It's all this money. This is the end result of all the bright lights and the comped trips, of all the champagne and free hotel suites, and all the broads and all the booze. It's all been arranged just for us to get your money. That's the truth about Las Vegas. 
INT. TANGIERS/FLOOR/SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY 
Camera follows JOHN NANCE carrying a small suitcase and walking through the casino to a door leading to the cashier's cage. The sign on the door reads 'Authorized Personnel Only'. He walks through the cage, to another door: 'Notice - Keep Out'. 
ACE (V.O.) We're the only winners. The players don't stand a chance. And their cash flows from the tables to our boxes ...through the cage and into the most sacred room in the casino ...the place where they add up all the money ...the holy of holies ...the count room. 
He opens the door. We see inside the count room from NANCE'S point of view. 
It looks like the area behind a teller's cage in a bank. A large room, windowless, decor-free. One side is a mesh cage, opened to reveal stacks of cash boxes. Several COUNTERS in white shirts are gathered around a glass table counting and sorting paper money.) 
ACE (V.O.) Now this place was off limits. 
COUNTER #1 Verify two thousand. 
ACE (V.O.) Even I couldn't get inside, but it was my job to keep it filled with cash. That's for sure. 
NICKY (V.O.) They had so much fuckin' money in there, you could build a house out of stacks of $100 bills. And the best part was that upstairs, the board of directors didn't know what the fuck was going on. 
At one end of the room the clerks empty the metal boxes and rapidly count the cash at a counting table. The camera follows a cash 'drop box' being lifted from the stack by a clerk. He pours the cash on to the table and shows the empty box to a video camera. COUNTER #2 rapidly counts the cash and announces: 
COUNTER #2 Five thousand. 
NICKY (V.O.) I mean, to them everything looked on the up and up. Right? Wrong. 
The first counter recounts the cash. 
COUNTER #1 Verify five thousand. 
NICKY (V.O.) The guys inside the counting room... 
Stacks of bills lie nearby. The camera pans across the room to another table manned by a COUNT ROOM EXECUTIVE who repeats the figure and writes it down on a master list. 
COUNT ROOM EXEC Five thousand. 
We move back to NANCE opening a cabinet full of stacks of $100 bills. He opens his suitcase and begins to fill it with cash. As he does this, the workers studiously look in other directions. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...were all slipped in there to skim the joint dry.  They'd do short counts, they'd lose fill slips. They'd even take cash right out of the drop boxes. And it was up to this guy right here [NANCE], standin' in front of about two million dollars, to skim the cash off the top without anybody gettin' wise ...the IRS or anybody. 
COUNTER #1 Verify two hundred. 
NANCE closes the case and walks out. One of the counters dumps another container of money on the table. 
NICKY (V.O.) Now, notice how in the count room nobody ever seems to see anything. Somehow, somebody's always lookin' the other way. Now, look at these guys [COUNTERS]. They look busy, right?  They're countin' money. Who wants to bother them? I mean, God forbid they should make a mistake and forget to steal. Meanwhile, you're in and you're out. 
NANCE exits the count room and proceeds through the lobby of the casino, passing ACE and SHERBERT, to a side exit door. 
NICKY Past the jag-off guard who gets an extra c-note a week just to watch the door.  I mean, it's routine. Business as usual: in, out, hello, goodbye. And that's all there is to it. Just another fat fuck walkin' out of the casino with a suitcase. Now, that suitcase was goin' straight to one place: right to Kansas City ...which was as close to Las Vegas as the Midwest bosses could go without gettin' themselves arrested. 
NANCE leaves the casino and gets into a cab parked at the curb. 
EXT. KANSAS CITY AIRPORT - DAY 
NANCE arrives. He is greeted by ARTIE PISCANO, a gray-haired sixty-year-old underboss. 
TITLE IN: 'KANSAS CITY' 
NICKY (V.O.) That suitcase was all the bosses ever wanted ...and they wanted it every month. 
PISCANO Hey, John, how are you? How was your ride? 
EXT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
NANCE, with suitcase, and PISCANO leave the car and enter the produce market. 
NICKY (V.O.) Now this old Mormon fuck here... 
CUT TO: NANCE, AS HE GETS OUT OF PISCANO'S CAR 
INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
NANCE and PISCANO walk through the grocery store, through the warehouse, past various employees to a doorway leading into the back room, where they are greeted by five older men around a large wooden table with bowls of macaroni and old jelly glasses filled with red wine. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...he had to fly in with suitcases once a month, nice and easy. 
NANCE Somethin' smells good. 
PISCANO Yeah, they made us somethin' to eat. 
NICKY (V.O.) The bosses would come from all over the place: Detroit, Cleveland, Milwaukee. All over the Midwest. And they would meet in the back of this produce market in Kansas City. I mean, nobody even knew. 
NANCE shakes hands with AMERICO CAPELLI, sixty-eight, a bald, affable Milwaukee entrepreneur and ARTHUR CAPP, his thirty- year-old yuppie lawyer son. 
Camera continues to pan around the room. 
NICKY (V.O.) One of the guys made his mother do all the cooking. 
On VINCENT BORELLI, seventy-year-old Kansas City boss. 
BORELLI Did you ever see that guy Jerry Steriano? 
On VINNIE FORLANO, mid-seventies, an old-timer who once drove for Capone and is now Remo Gaggi's right-hand man. 
FORLANO Jerry Steriano? 
BORELLI Yeah. 
NICKY (V.O.) Now, these old greaseballs might not look it, but believe me, these are the guys who secretly controlled Las Vegas. 
PISCANO joins his MOTHER and DAUGHTER by a stove. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER That man's here again. 
Piscano dips a piece of bread into a pot of tomato sauce. 
DEALER (Humming, fielding, every roll.) 
CAMERA PANS TO A FLOOR MAN, STANDING DIRECTLY BEHIND THE BOX MAN. 
ACE (V.O.) The floor men are watching the box men. 
CAMERA SWISH PANS TO REVEAL A PIT BOSS STEPPING IN, SCANNING THE FLOOR. 
ACE (V.O.) The pit bosses are watching the floor men. 
SWISH PAN TO A SHIFT BOSS SURVEYING THE CASINO. 
ACE (V.O.) The shift bosses are watching the pit bosses. 
SWISH PAN TO SHERBERT. 
ACE (V.O.) The casino manager is watching the shift bosses. 
SWISH PAN TO ACE. 
ACE (V.O.) I'm watching the casino manager. 
CAMERA SWISH PANS AND TILTS UP TO A VIDEO CAMERA MOUNTED INSIDE A GLASS DOME HANGING FROM THE CEILING. 
ACE (V.O.) And the eye-in-the-sky is watching us all. 
SWISH PAN TO: 
INT. TANGIERS-EYE-IN-THE SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT 
Video monitors show a dealer fanning a row of bills. Swish pan to ACE and SHERBERT watching the monitor. ACE lights a cigarette. 
ACE (V.O.) Plus... 
SWISH PAN TO SURVEILLANCE CATWALKERS ADJUSTING CAMERAS AND SPYING ON PLAYERS BELOW WITH BINOCULARS. 
ACE (V.O.) ...we had a dozen guys up there, most of them ex-cheats, who knew every trick in the house. 
INT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT 
Ginger squeals as she throws the dice across the table. 
HIGH ROLLER Come on, come on. 
She rolls a winner. 
GINGER Yes! 
HIGH ROLLER Thank you. Very nice. 
GINGER (Chuckles) I told you I was hot tonight. 
INT. TANGIERS EYE-IN-THE-SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT 
Sound out: The monitor shows GINGER and the HIGH ROLLER cheering, she throws her arms around him. The crowd goes crazy. 
SWISH PAN TO ACE LOOKING ON INTENTLY. 
On screen, GINGER's hand sneaks a chip from the rack and subtly moves it towards her purse. 
INT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT 
Sound in: GINGER slips the chip quietly into her bag. 
HIGH ROLLER (Off-screen) Let's go. This is for Ginger. Come on. This is for Ginger. 
The HIGH ROLLER notices GINGER's hand on her purse. She pretends to have taken out her lipstick. 
GAMBLER #1 Let me have a hundred on the hard ten. Thank you. 
GAMBLER #2 Hard ten. One hundred. 
INT. TANGIERS EYE-IN-THE-SKY MONITOR ROOM - NIGHT 
ACE continues to look at the monitor. SHERBERT and a security man seated at a video console also look on. 
INT. TANGIERS CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT 
A craps stick pushes some dice towards GINGER. She rolls again, only this time she craps out. Gamblers groan, then applaud her. She's made so much money for the table that the winners toss chips in her direction. 
HIGH ROLLER I'm sorry. 
GINGER Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. (To the table) Thank you very much. Thank you very much. 
ACE and two casino execs are now on the floor watching her. 
GINGER Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast. 
HIGH ROLLER Ginger, honey. 
DEALER Thank you very much, now. 
HIGH ROLLER Ginger, honey, this is for you love. Thanks for your time. 
She turns to the HIGH ROLLER, who is handing her a thin stack of chips worth about $2,000. 
GINGER (Chuckles) Come on. 
HIGH ROLLER What's the matter? 
GINGER What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut. 
HIGH ROLLER What money? I've seen you stealing from me. 
GINGER What money?  Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end. 
HIGH ROLLER Ginger, I've been watching you all night. You've been stealing from me. 
GINGER Don't give me that shit. I want my money. 
HIGH ROLLER That bag's full of fuckin' chips you 
GINGER (Interrupts) What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you. 
ACE watches the argument heat up. 
HIGH ROLLER Get lost, Ginger! Get lost! 
GINGER Get lost? 
HIGH ROLLER Yes. 
GINGER Get lost? 
HIGH ROLLER Yes. 
GINGER knocks the chip rack out of his hands. 
GINGER Well, how 'bout that? 
HIGH ROLLER Come on! (He bends down to pick them up.) 
Gamblers and dealers shout and yell. She picks up another rack of chips and tosses them into the air, then another, and another. Chips fly all over the casino. Everyone starts diving for chips. Dealers. Players. Security guards. Waitresses. Pit bosses. Bedlam. 
ACE and the two execs with him are the only ones not diving for chips. He looks at GINGER. She looks at him. 
FREEZE FRAME ON GINGER. 
Slow motion: GINGER smiles at ACE and walks off. 
ACE (V.O.) What a move. I fell in love right there. 
INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT 
GINGER and ACE are seated on a banquette. Close up of his hand attaching a diamond and ruby pin to her dress. Tilt up to GINGER's smiling face beaming at ACE. 
ACE (V.O.) But in Vegas, for a girl like Ginger, love costs money. 
They kiss. 
GINGER I'm going to go powder my nose. (ACE hands GINGER a single $50 bill. She smiles coyly. He hands her another fifty.) 
ACE (V.O.) Ginger's mission in life was money. 
GINGER I'll be right back. 
ACE (O.S.) (from following scene) See you, Ginger. 
FLASHBACK - EXT. CASINO ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
GINGER waves goodbye to the DOORMAN and walks towards two VALET PARKERS who greet her warmly. She gets a bottle of pills from one of them and slips some cash into his hand in return. 
GINGER Okay, thank you for asking. 
ACE (V.O.) She was a queen around the casino. She brought in high rollers and helped them spread around a lot of money. 
GINGER (To VALET PARKERS) Hello. 
VALET PARKER Hey, Ginger, how you doin'? 
GINGER Great. (Handing the VALET some money.) And I have something for you. You got me covered? 
The VALET PARKER places a vial of pills in her hand. 
VALET PARKER Yes. Something for you, there. 
GINGER And you do. Thank you very much. 
VALET PARKER Take care of yourself. 
FLASHBACK - INT. HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT 
GINGER hands the pills to HIGH ROLLER #2 in his hotel bathroom, where he is washing his face and trying to energize himself. 
GINGER I got some lucky pills for you, honey. 
HIGH ROLLER #2 Oh, yeah? 
ACE (V.O.) Who didn't want Ginger? She was one of the best-known, best-liked and most respected hustlers in town. Smart hustlers like her could keep a guy awake for two or three days before sending him home broke to the little woman and his bank examiners. 
INT. COCKTAIL LOUNGE - NIGHT 
GINGER comes back from the ladies room. She kisses ACE. 
ACE Any change? 
Mob bosses FORLANO, CAPELLI, GAGGI, BORELLI and PISCANO seated around the back room table eating and talking as in the opening vignette. 
NICKY (V.O.) They sent me out there to make sure that nobody fucked with Ace and... 
INT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE, LAS VEGAS - DAY 
ACE opens the door to NICKY and JENNIFER. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...nobody interfered with the fuckin' skim. 
ACE (Opening door) Hey. 
JENNIFER Hey, how you doin'? (Kisses ACE.) 
NICKY Hey. Hey, Sammy, how are you? 
JENNIFER and NICKY take in ACE's spectacular Vegas-style penthouse. 
JENNIFER (Whispering) Wow. 
NICKY Boy, look at this place, huh? 
JENNIFER Incredible. 
NICKY All right. 
ACE Welcome to Vegas. 
CAMERA TILTS UP TO REVEAL A SWEEPING VIEW OF THE LAS VEGAS SKYLINE. 
NICKY Okay, Sammy. 
ACE Somethin', huh? 
NICKY Yeah. 
ACE (Calling her over) Ginger. 
GINGER emerges from the bedroom. NICKY and JENNIFER are both stunned by her beauty. 
NICKY (To ACE) Holy shit, what've you been doin' out here? 
ACE Honey, come here. 
She walks to them 
ACE This is Jennifer and Nick. They're dear friends of mine. 
JENNIFER (Shaking hands) Good to meet you. 
GINGER Hi, Jennifer. 
NICKY Pleasure. (Grasping GINGER's hand and kissing it.) Very nice to meet you. 
GINGER Hi, how are you? 
NICKY Okay, Sammy. 
INT. ACE'S CAR, LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT 
ACE and NICKY are driving through town, the neon lights of Vegas reflected in the windshield. 
ACE (V.O.) After we ate, we left Jennifer and Ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. And then... he hit me with it. 
NICKY What do you think about me movin' out here? (ACE looks away.) What's the matter? You got a problem with that? 
ACE No, of course not. 
NICKY (Playfully) You mean, I have your permission? 
ACE Sure, you have my permission. But I - I just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. It's no joke, you know? You gotta keep a low profile. It's not like back home. Right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. And this sheriff's a real cowboy. Even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here. 
NICKY I don't care. I want to get away from back home for a while. I'm tired of that shit back there. (Referring to the Vegas lights.) Look at this place. It's made of money. You know what the best part is? Nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! There's nobody here to see us! Everybody's back home. 
ACE Nick, I gotta tell you, I got pinched twice for no reason. You really gotta be careful. I'm running a licensed place. Everything's legit. 
NICKY Don't worry about it. I'm not gonna do anything. What am I gonna do? I'm especially not gonna involve you in anything. 
ACE gives NICKY a look. 
EXT./INT. LAS VEGAS SPORTSBOOK - NIGHT 
NICKY and MARINO pull up in their car and get out. 
NICKY (V.O.) Ace saw Vegas one way. 
NICKY You call this guy and tell him I'm comin'? 
MARINO Of course. 
They walk into the sportsbook, past numerous bar patrons and gamblers to TONY, the bookie at a betting counter. 
NICKY (V.O.) But I saw it another. I saw it as untouched. I mean, they had bookies, pimps and drug dealers I could shake down. Who the fuck were they gonna run to?  So, I started getting everybody in line. Best of all, for the first time in my life, I figured out a way not to lose. 
ACE (V.O.) Yeah, he had a fool-proof scheme, all right. It wasn't very scientific but it worked. When he won, he collected. When he lost, he told the bookies to go fuck themselves. What were they gonna do? Muscle Nicky? (Chuckles.) Nicky was the muscle. 
NICKY grabs TONY by the back of his neck. 
NICKY Tony. 
TONY Hey. 
NICKY How you doin'? 
TONY How you doin'? 
NICKY All right, yeah. You got that thing for me? 
TONY What thing? Oh, Nicky... I thought you was layin'. 
NICKY I was layin'? No, no, I'm taking it. I was takin' it. 
TONY You sure? 
NICKY I'm positive. 
TONY Well, I'm a little confused here. 
NICKY You're a little confused? 
TONY Yeah. 
NICKY (Pointing to a window, above a counter with a tiny opening to talk through) Maybe if I stick your fuckin' face through this window over here like, you know, you'll - you'll get unconfused. Give me the fuckin' money! 
TONY takes some money out of his coat pocket. 
TONY (Groaning) I'm sorry, Nicky. I didn't mean anything by it. 
NICKY Yeah, I know, that's why you had it ready. You thought I was fuckin' layin' it?! 
He smacks the bookie on the head with the wad of money. 
TONY (Gasps) My fuckin' head. 
NICKY Your fuckin' head, huh? Don't fuck around, Tony. 
MARINO (Pointing to TONY) Smarten up. 
NICKY (Walking out) You jag-off. 
CLASSROOM NUN (O.S.) (From following scene) And now... 
INT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY 
NICKY and JENNIFER stand in the background with other parents listening to a NUN school teacher. LITTLE NICKY and other youngsters are seated at small children's desks. 
CLASSROOM NUN ...Nicholas Santoro will come up and tell us about our first president. 
LITTLE NICKY (Stepping up in front of the class to begin a speech) George Washington was born in a... 
ACE (V.O.) But still, it was nice and quiet for a while. Ginger and I presented Nicky and Jennifer all over town, like regular Ozzie and Harriets. 
LITTLE NICKY ...typical Virginia farmhouse. 
EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY 
NICKY and DETECTIVE BOB JOHNSON are coaching their sons. JOHNSON pats LITTLE NICKY on the back and with encouraging words sends him running on to the field. 
DETECTIVE JOHNSON (To LITTLE NICKY) Beautiful. You got a beautiful swing. 
NICKY (V.O.) Ace got my son, little Nicky, involved with Little League, and it was great. 
DETECTIVE JOHNSON Now, I want you to get out there and get me singles and doubles, okay? 'Cause that's what's gonna win this game. 
NICKY (V.O.) Turned out to be one of the other coaches was a fuckin'... 
DETECTIVE JOHNSON Now go out there and show your dad what you can do. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...metro intelligence cop. But it didn't matter. I mean, it was all about the kids, you know. 
DETECTIVE JOHNSON You know, he's gotta realize everything can't be a home run that he does. 
NICKY Yeah, well, that's exactly what I keep tellin' him, but that's the kind of kid he is ever since he's born. 
DETECTIVE JOHNSON It's instinctive, you know. 
NICKY He tries to do everything... 
LITTLE NICKY hits the ball, NICKY and DETECTIVE JOHNSON applaud. 
NICKY Ohh! 
ACE (V.O.) And, Nicky being Nicky, he made his presence known. 
INT. TANGIERS CASHIER'S CAGE CREDIT WINDOW - NIGHT 
NICKY saunters through the casino and up to EDDY and JERRY, two well-dressed hoods who are signing papers at the cashier's credit window near ACE and SHERBERT. 
ACE (V.O.) Especially at the casino, where he definitely did not work, people got the message. 
NICKY (V.O.) Me? That's why the bosses sent me out here. They wanted me to make sure none of the other crews robbed the joint. Like these two fuckin' balloon-heads over here [EDDY and JERRY]. They were gonna try and bang us out of two hundred fuckin' grand? (Chuckling.) Yeah, right, I'm sure. 
JERRY (Shakes NICKY's hand) Hey, Nicky. How are you? 
NICKY Hey, Eddy. 
SIGNALER Well, I... I never tried. 
ACE So, you're a righty? 
SIGNALER Ye-yeah. 
ACE nods to one of the GUARDS. Instantly a large rubber mallet smashes onto the man's right hand four times to the sound of screams. ACE watches. 
ACE Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand. 
SIGNALER God! (He moans and sits back.) 
WINNER (O.S.) (From following scene) It's a hundred... 
INT. CASINO CASHIER'S CAGE AREA - NIGHT 
The WINNER has been standing outside the cashier's cage waiting for his $110,000 in chips to be cashed. SHERBERT walks up behind him. 
WINNER ...a hundred ten. 
CASHIER Yes, it is. 
WINNER I think. 
CASHIER Yes. 
WINNER Okay. 
SHERBERT Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public. 
WINNER Yeah. 
SHERBERT (To CASHIER) Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh? 
CASHIER Yes. 
SHERBERT A little privacy. And, by the way, send over a... nice bottle of champagne on ice, huh? 
CASHIER Sure will. 
SHERBERT Real special.  Somethin'... (To WINNER.) By the way...  I'm Billy Sherbert, your casino manager. 
He shakes hands with the WINNER. 
WINNER Hi. 
SHERBERT Having a good time? 
SHERBERT leads him away from the cage. 
WINNER Yes, uh... 
SHERBERT You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need... 
WINNER Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings? 
INT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT 
The WINNER is pushed through the door by two GUARDS followed by SHERBERT and sees his pal moaning in pain and holding his broken hand. 
SIGNALER Look what they did to my hand, man! 
ACE (Walks over to the WINNER) All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want? 
SHERBERT stands next to the WINNER 
WINNER I just wanna get out of here. 
ACE And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand? 
WINNER I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake. 
ACE You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it? 
WINNER Yeah. 
ACE Get out of here. 
WINNER Thank you. 
The GUARDS usher the WINNER out of the room. 
ACE (To the GUARDS, referring to the SIGNALER) Throw him out in the alley.  And just tell the cops he got hit by a car. 
INT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE 
ACE and GINGER are alone in the living room. The apartment looks out on the glittering neon signs of the Strip. 
ACE (V.O.) Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot. 
ACE We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around? 
GINGER What, are you trying to handicap me? 
ACE I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me? (GINGER looks doubtful.) I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family. 
GINGER (Sighs, laughing) You got the wrong girl, Sam. 
ACE I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother. 
GINGER You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know? 
ACE I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore. 
GINGER You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't. 
ACE Yeah, I know all that. 
GINGER I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you. 
ACE (Brushing cigarette ash off his dressing gown) I - I - I... 
GINGER Understand? (Pause) I'm sorry. 
ACE No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that. 
GINGER If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me? 
ACE You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine. 
GINGER (Interrupts) What're you... what're you pitching me, here? 
ACE Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you. (Pause) Want to take a chance? 
She looks at him. ACE is holding her hand tightly. 
INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM MARRIAGE - NIGHT 
ACE and GINGER are seated at a banquet table with various guests, drinking champagne. AMY, their six-month-old child is in a cradle. NICKY and JENNIFER are hovering around the baby with LITTLE NICKY and are blissfully happy. It is an elegant affair.  City Officials, politicians and gaming officials are there, plus, SHERBERT and Ace's boss, PHILIP GREEN. A photographer takes pictures of the guests. 
ACE (V.O.) When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.' 
NICKY (V.O.) It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her - 
We see AMY in the cradle. 
NICKY (V.O.) - he still covered his bets. They had to have the baby first, before they got married. Even made Jennie and me watch Amy for a few days when they went on their honeymoon. But I didn't mind, we loved the kid.

EXECUTIVE How are you? 
GINGER Oh. 
GINGER gives the flirting EXECUTIVE her hand, he kisses it. 
EXECUTIVE You're one of the most gorgeous women I've ever seen. You're a lucky man Mr Rothstein.

ACE What about the progressives with the high jackpots? Where are they? These machines are hidden. 
WARD Well... 
ACE These are our best machines. They bring all the action. No wonder the drop is off. 
WARD Yeah, okay. 
ACE The action is in the front, not in the back. Bring 'em up front. 
WARD All right, I will, I will.

WARD I do understand that. I'll get right on it. And thank you.

INT. CLASSY RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
GINGER follows a snooty MAITRE D' to JENNIFER, already seated at a table. 
ACE (V.O.) So, I ended up workin' what? Eighteen- hour days?  Ginger was the one who wound up enjoying the best of Vegas. 
MAITRE D' (To JENNIFER) Come with me, please. I have a better table for you.  Sorry. 
He shows the two of them to the best table in the place. 
JENNIFER (Sitting down next to GINGER) So, what'd you say to that fuckin' jerk anyway? 
GINGER (Smiling) I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein. 
JENNIFER (Chuckles) Well, you might as well get somethin' out of it. 
GINGER lights a cigarette. 
EXT. IDLE SPURS DESERT DINER - DAY 
Wide overhead of roadhouse cafe isolated in the middle of the desert with a sign out front that reads '60 miles to Vegas'. 
ACE (V.O.) Well, it wasn't long before what I was afraid was gonna happen, happened. Nicky managed to get himself banned from every casino in Las Vegas, and from then on, I couldn't be seen talkin' to him anywhere in Vegas, or even near it. 
NICKY (From inside the diner) What the fuck is that supposed to mean? 
INT. IDLE SPURS DESERT DINER - DAY 
ACE and NICKY are seated at a table in the empty diner. 
NICKY (Reading from a document) ' ...detrimental to gaming. And he will be ejected from any casino in Las Vegas...  and the casinos can be fined as much as a hundred thousand every time he shows up.' (He waves the document.) Do you believe this shit? 
ACE (Smoking a cigarette) Yeah, I believe it. You got banned. 
NICKY hisses. 
NICKY (Reading) 'Who is of notorious and unsavory reputation...' 
He angrily wads the document and tosses it across the table. 
NICKY Motherfucker.  Unsavory fuckin'... Is there any way around this? 
ACE Nope, there's no way. 
NICKY Let's say... for instance... I want to go in the restaurant which happens to be in the casino... to get one of those sandwiches I like? 
ACE Forget it. You can't even set foot in the parking lot. That's how serious it is. 
NICKY In other words, I'm fucked. 
ACE In so many words, yes. 
ACE (V.O.) It just didn't sink into his head about the Black Book and what it meant. Not being able to go into a casino is just one thing, but being in this book etched your name into the brains of every cop and FBI agent in the state. I mean, you're listed in there with Al Capone. But Nicky didn't care. 
NICKY I gotta do somethin'. I gotta do somethin'. They ain't gettin' rid of me. They're not gettin' rid of me. I'm staying here. Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em.

To keep an eye on things, I brought in my kid brother Dominick... and some desperadoes from back home and started knockin' over high rollers, casino bosses, bookmakers, anybody, right here in town. I had a good fuckin' crew goin' for me, I'll tell you that. 
SAL FUSCO, JACK HARDY and BERNIE BLUE are getting out of a car and walking into the jewelry store which is designed to replicate an old-fashioned Western town with peaked roofs, wooden planked sidewalks and hitching posts. The camera tracks by each man as they're introduced. 
NICKY (V.O.) I had Sal Fusco, a great second-story guy. Jack Hardy, he worked for a safe company after he did a six-year bit. And then there was Bernie Blue. This guy could bypass any alarm for me. And I opened up my own jewelry store, too: 'The Gold Rush'. 
INT. BEDROOM OF LUXURY HOME - NIGHT 
NICKY places some jewelry from a vanity table into a sack and turns over some family photos. MARINO and HARDY are struggling with a safe. 
NICKY (V.O.) Sometimes I used to go along on a heist just for the fun of it. But I didn't like the people I was rippin' off lookin' at me, so I used to turn their fuckin' pictures around. 
NICKY (To MARINO and HARDY) What's takin' so long over there? 
MARINO This peter's a motherfucker. 
HARDY (Grunting) It's workin'. Just keep workin' it. It's comin'. 
NICKY Gotta learn how to open these fuckin' things so you won't have to take 'em.

INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT, KITCHEN - NIGHT 
A prosciutto sandwich is being prepared on a kitchen counter. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...in some legitimate places, like my restaurant. 
DOMINICK (To COOK preparing sandwich) Is that the last one? 
COOK Yeah. 
He hands the sandwich to DOMINICK who spits in it. 
NICKY (V.O.) I had my kid brother, Dominick, run it for me. 
DOMINICK (Spits) Fuckers! 
DOMINICK wraps it in plastic and puts it into a brown paper bag. 
INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
DOMINICK sets the bag with the wrapped sandwich in it on top of pizza boxes being held by two uniformed Vegas COPS. 
DOMINICK Here you go, guys. 
COP #1 All right. Thanks, a lot. 
DOMINICK Yeah... yeah, enjoy. 
COP #2 Yeah. 
He shakes COP #2's hand before heading back into the restaurant. 
DOMINICK Have a good time. (Muttering to himself.) Choke on it, ya motherfucker! 
MAN #1 (Passing DOMINICK on his way out) Hey, Dom. 
DOMINICK Hey, how you doin'? 
DOMINICK walks over to some patrons in the bar area. NICKY enters, kissing his brother. 
ACE (V.O.) Yeah, Nicky loved restaurants. He was a real restaurant buff. And over the years, he always made money with them. 
NICKY (Looking at one of the patrons) Hey, Rich. 
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS NICKY AROUND THE RESTAURANT PAST LAS VEGAS TYPES - DEALERS, LOUNGE ACTS, SHOWGIRLS, TV AND MOVIE CELEBRITIES, WAITRESSES AND BARMEN - WHO USE THE JAMMED PLACE AS THEIR HANGOUT. 
ACE (V.O.) In Vegas, he had The Leaning Tower. It was a very popular spot. He had politicians, showgirls and movies stars hangin' out all over the place. 
NICKY walks up to STEVE ALLEN and JAYNE MEADOWS seated at a table, he whistles their theme tune as he approaches from behind. 
NICKY Listen, that show over at the Flamingo gets better and better. 
STEVE ALLEN By the way, Sammy said whenever you have a minute, give him a call. 
NICKY Made a messenger out of you too, huh? 
STEVE ALLEN (Laughs) I'll do anything for a buck. 
NICKY He does it. He does it to everybody. Enjoy your dinner. 
JAYNE MEADOWS (Chuckles) Thanks. 
STEVE ALLEN Okay, thanks. 
ACE (V.O.) But I gotta tell you, the thing Nicky liked the most was the showgirls, naturally. I mean, to them, Nicky was the movie star. 
NICKY walks across the room to MARINO and two showgirls, SHELLY and STACY. 
NICKY (To MARINO) You walk past me? 
MARINO Hey. This is Shelly. 
NICKY Hey, Shelly. (Kisses her hand.) 
SHELLY Hi. 
NICKY How are you? Nice to meet you. 
MARINO (Pointing to STACY) And this is Stacy. 
NICKY Stacy. (Kisses her hand.) 
MARINO (To the SHOWGIRLS) This is Nick. 
NICKY Pleasure. 
STACY Hi, Nick. 
MARINO We're gonna have dinner. Come on. 
NICKY All right, uh, (To SHELLY) Let's just check the kitchen first. Excuse us one second. Come on, I'll show you. 
He takes SHELLY's hand and leads her out. 
NICKY (V.O.) (From following scene) 'Cause I fly stuff in fresh every day. 
INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT, PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
NICKY and SHELLY walk across the parking lot and get into his two-tone, red and white car. 
NICKY I get bread from back home. I get fish from California. And you can always tell a great kitchen like ours because of the milk-fed veal. That's the secret. 
Opening the car door from the passenger's side, she gets in. 
NICKY See, milk-fed veal is pure white. Out here, they got that pink veal. Slide over, honey. 
She slides over, he gets into the passenger's seat and closes the door. 
NICKY Now, pink veal, you can pound that shit for two days and it'll never get tender, you know what I mean? 
SHELLY's head disappears into NICKY's lap. 
INT. LEANING TOWER RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
FRANK and DOMINICK are at the bar watching as NICKY chastises AL, a gambler. The restaurant is empty except for a waiter milling around in the background, setting a few tables. 
AL When I left here with the money... 
NICKY Mm. 
AL ...I got muscled on the street. 
NICKY Mm. 
AL A couple of guys, I owe them. So, that's what I did. I gave 'em the money.  That's what I did. 
NICKY Yeah? 
AL Yeah. 
NICKY You call yourself a man? You know you're a lyin', low-life, motherfuckin' gambling degenerate prick? You know that's what you are? Two small kids at home. I gave you money to pay the fuckin' rent and buy groceries, put the heat on. You know your wife called Frankie and told him the fuckin' heat's off? 
AL glances over to MARINO. 
NICKY Huh? And you didn't gamble that fuckin' money? You're gonna stand here and tell me that? 
He shakes his head 'no'. 
NICKY No, no? You didn't? 
AL I didn't give 'em the m- 
NICKY Don't fuck with me, Al! Don't make a fuck out of me! You want to embarrass me and make a fool out of me?!  You didn't gamble?! Tell me you gambled the fuckin' money, I'll give you the fuckin' money to put the fuckin' heat on! Did you gamble?! Huh?! 
The chastised gambler nods 'yes', bowing his head in shame. 
NICKY Fuckin' degenerate, you. 
NICKY takes some money from his coat pocket and starts counting out some bills. 
NICKY Fuckin' kids at home!  Here. (Giving him the money.) Get the fuck out of here.

ACE So what? Everybody out here with cowboy boots is a fuckin' county commissioner or related to a county commissioner. I'm fuckin' sick of it. 
GREEN This is his state. His uncle's Chief Judge. His brother-in-law runs the County Commission. I don't know how many other relatives he's got in town.  There's gotta be a way to work him back in. 
ACE Phil, I can understand. You're in the finances, you're upstairs, but you are not on the floor. I got thousands of players. I got five hundred dealers.  They're all lookin' to rob me blind, twenty-four hours a day. I have to let them know I'm watching all the details, all the time; that there is not one single thing I will not catch as I am over here. 
Breaks open his blueberry muffin, puts it down and points to Green's. 
ACE Look at yours. 
GREEN What? 
ACE Look at that. Look at this. There's nothin'... look how many blueberries your muffin has and how many mine has. Yours is falling apart. I have nothing.

GINGER (Picking up an empty carton of milk) Yeah. 
ACE Why do you need that much? 
GINGER Well, what's the difference? I just need it. 
ACE Well, I mean... you know, I gotta ask you. That's a lot of money. You're not asking for a box of popcorn, you know. I mean... 
GINGER I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal. (Getting up to the refrigerator.) Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself. 
ACE Who's fighting? I mean, I'm, you know, tell me what it's for. 
GINGER, annoyed, closes the refrigerator door. 
ACE Why can't you tell me what it's for? 
She stirs her coffee. 
ACE Huh? (Pause) Well, you know what? Now, I want you to tell me. I mean, my wife comes to me and asks me for twenty-five thousand. I mean, what do you want? Do you want a coat? 
GINGER No. 
ACE Well, if you want a coat, you got it. You know that. It's not the money, it's just why do you want it?  That's all I'm askin'. Am I not entitled to that? 
GINGER Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this. 
ACE What are you talkin' a- ? 
GINGER (Interrupting) Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad? 
ACE You're askin' me for twenty-five thousand. I'm not out to make you feel bad. I want to just be able to trust you. You now, it's about trust. I have to be able to trust you with my life. Do you understand? Can I trust you? (She doesn't answer.) Can I trust you?... Can I trust you?... Answer me. Can I trust you? 
GINGER (Quietly) You can trust me.

GINGER It means I got the money. 
LESTER You got money. That's a - That's a good look. 
SWISH PAN TO ACE ENTERING, FOLLOWED BY A HOOD. HE SITS DOWN AT THE BOOTH WITH LESTER AND GINGER. 
ACE How you doin', Les? It's Lester, right? Sam. 
Extends his hand to LESTER, who shakes it. 
ACE From my recollection, aren't you the card shark... the golf hustler... the pimp from Beverly Hills? 
LESTER gives GINGER a 'how did you fuck this up?' Look. 
ACE If I'm wrong, please correct me, 'cause I never knew you to be a heist man. (LESTER sighs.) But if you are, you know what... here, take mine too. 
ACE takes some money out of his coat and puts the thick wad of bills on the table. 
ACE Go ahead, take it. 'Cause you already have hers. 
LESTER turns and sees two HOODS standing by the front and back doors of the diner. 
ACE She's my wife. (To LESTER.) Look at me. You did know that, didn't you? You knew that she's my wife? Huh? Hey, look at me. 
LESTER Yeah, yeah. I know that. 
ACE You do? Yeah? Well, if you ever come back again... ever... to take her money... next time bring a pistol. That way you got a chance. Be a man, don't be a fuckin' pimp. Now, you want to do me a favor? Get out of here. I want to be alone with my wife. Get the fuck up and get out of here. 
After stammering for a moment, LESTER gets up and begins to move towards the back door. 
LESTER (Quietly) Okay. 
ACE You fuckin' piece of shit. 
LESTER Hey, that's just fuckin' - That's bullshit. You know, you know, what the fuck? 
The thugs follow him out of the back door. GINGER freezes. 
ACE You remember when you called him that night? When you said goodbye to him?  He didn't say, 'Don't get married, I'll be right down, we'll get married.'  He didn't say that to you, did he? 
GINGER (Whispering) No, he didn't. 
ACE (Picks up the money) Didn't. No, instead, what did he say? 'Fuck him. Take him for everything he's got.' 
ACE takes GINGER by the arm to the rear of the diner where they can see the parking area through a glass door. 
ACE Come here, I want to show you somethin'. 
EXT. REAR OF SALVADORAN DINER, PARKING LOT - DAY 
Three HOODS rush LESTER who is running towards his car. GINGER bursts through the doors, trying to get to LESTER. ACE holds her back. They struggle. LESTER groans and gasps as the HOODS start to beat him up. 
HOOD #1 You fuckin' shit. 
GINGER No! No! No! Don't! 
ACE restrains her. 
The HOODS punch LESTER in the face and stomach. 
GINGER Make them stop it! (Sobbing.) No! No! No! It's not his fault! It's my fault! 
NICKY watches from a car in a parking lot across the street, out of GINGER's sight. 
ACE forces GINGER into the car as the HOODS finish the beating. 
GINGER (Sobbing) No! No! 
The HOODS toss LESTER into his car. 
LESTER (Falling into the front seat on his back.) Fuck! 
NICKY watches as the HOODS walk away from LESTER's car. 
LESTER Fuck you! 
HOOD #2 You piece of shit. 
ACE pulls out of the parking lot with a wailing GINGER. 
LESTER groans, trying to sit up. 
ACE I can't do that. And I appreciate the fact that he's your brother-in- law, and I do want to help you and I like to do favors, and I know who you are, but I cannot do that. 
WEBB Well, could there be any position... further down the trough? 
ACE (Pause) I'm sorry, I can't do anything. He's too incompetent. And the bottom line is, he cannot be trusted. 
The telephone rings. ACE picks it up. 
ACE (Into telephone) Okay, thanks. (To WEBB.) Um... you know, that's it. I'm sorry. 
WEBB Mr Rothstein. Your people never will understand the way it works out here. You're all just our guests. But you act like you're at home. Let me tell you somethin', partner... you ain't home. But that's where we're gonna send you if it harelips the Governor. (Pause.) Thank you for your time. 
ACE No problem. (Getting up and shaking hands.) Sorry. 
WEBB (Smiles slightly) You bet. 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, BATHROOM/BEDROOM - DAY 
ACE, in pain from his ulcer, opens a bottle of pills in his bathroom and sees that it is almost empty. 
ACE What happened to my pills? 
He leaves the bathroom and walks into the bedroom where GINGER is stretched out on their imperial bed. 
GINGER Huh? 
ACE (Waving the pill bottle) Isn't it bad enough you're drinkin' too much, you're takin' all my pills too? 
GINGER I didn't take your pills. 
ACE Look - for my ulcer, I take a half a one of these, a half a one of these. And that's when I have extreme pain. I had a three-month supply. What'd you do with 'em? 
GINGER (Sobbing) You didn't have to beat him up! 
ACE (Walking back to the bathroom) What? 
ACE puts the bottle into the medicine cabinet. 
GINGER (Sobbing) I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy! 
ACE Yeah, how do I know? 
GINGER (Sobbing) You can't make me stop caring... 
ACE What? What?! 
GINGER I said, you can't make me stop caring about people. 
She starts to cry. 
ACE (Trying to calm her) Listen. (Stepping up to the bed.) Ginger. I'm tryin' to make the best of everything here, you know?  I mean, you're my wife, for chrissakes. Uh, I mean... people look up to you in this town. I don't know what to think - 
GINGER (Interrupts) You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here. (Crying.) I am. 
She sits up woozy, and tries to pull on her trousers. 
ACE (Walking around the bed to her) It's okay.  Look... (holding her face, gently) ...you gotta get a hold of yourself. 
GINGER Okay. 
ACE If not for me, at least for Amy. 
GINGER (Sobbing) Okay, okay. 
ACE (Gently) You understand? Your drinking's gettin' way out of hand. I'm gonna get you into a program. They got plenty of good ones. 
GINGER I don't need one. 
ACE Yes, you do. It's very discreet. There's no names in the papers. You don't have to worry about any of that stuff. 
GINGER That's all you care about. (Collapsing on the edge of the bed.) You don't care about me at all. 
ACE (Bending down to her) Yes, I - yes, I do. 
GINGER No, you don't. 
ACE How could you say that?  You're a beautiful woman. You're destroying yourself. You don't need that stuff. You don't need that fuckin' leech livin' off you. I know you better than you know yourself. You're a tiger, you're stronger than I am. And when you set your mind on doing something, you do it better than anybody. (Strokes her hair. Then, quietly:) You can do it. (Kissing her.) You can do it. 
GINGER (Sobbing) Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay.  Okay... I'll try. I'll try. 
She sits up and puts her arms around ACE's waist. He strokes her head. 
GINGER I'll try. I will. Don't be mad at me, okay... I will. 
INT. TANGIERS HARD COUNT ROOM - DAY 
Move in on a door that reads: 'Notice - No Admittance - Caution - Hearing Protection Must Be Worn In This Area'. NANCE opens it with a key to reveal the hard count room. Coins tumble of a conveyor belt. 
NICKY (V.O.) No matter what the problems were outside the count room, it was all worth it. The cash kept rollin' in. And the... 
EXT. CASINO REAR LOADING PLATFORM - DAY 
NANCE, dumping two large suitcases in the trunk of a car. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...suitcases kept comin' and goin'. And let me tell ya, the fuckin' bottom line here is... cash. 
The trunk lid is shut. 
INT. TANGIERS SOFT COUNT ROOM - DAY 
The counters sort through a pile of cash on a table. The camera moves on one counter as he pockets some cash. 
NICKY (V.O.) The only problem was that, after a while, the bosses noticed that the suitcases were gettin' a little light. 
FREEZE FRAME ON THE COUNTER POCKETING A $100 BILL. 
INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
NANCE is seated at a table eating with FORLANO, CAPELLI, CAPP, BORELLI, PISCANO and GAGGI. 
BORELLI Aspett'. [Italian-American slang for 'Wait'] Wait a minute. You mean to tell me that the money we're robbing is bein' robbed? That somebody's robbing from us?  We go through all this fuckin' trouble, and somebody's robbin' us? 
GAGGI (To NANCE) Eh? 
NANCE Like I said, you know, i-it's part of the business. I-it's considered leakage. 
BORELLI Leakage, my balls. I want the guy who's robbin' us. 
INT. TANGIERS HARD COUNT ROOM - DAY 
NANCE enters through a door and walks past a man picking up a bucket of coins and dumping them into a trough. A clerk, seated at a coin weighing scale, places a ticket into a small tray. NANCE reads the printout of the machine. 
NICKY (V.O.) Even John Nance, that's the guy who ran the skim, he knew there wasn't much you could do about it. You gotta know that a guy who helps you steal, even if you take care of him real well, I mean, he's gonna steal a little bit extra for himself. Makes sense, don't it? Right? Well, you go try and make these hard-headed old greaseballs understand that. 
INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
BORELLI What's the point of skimming if we're being skimmed? Defeats the whole purpose of what we're doin' out there. 
GAGGI (To NANCE) Huh? 
NANCE You know, they take this money because they're my guys. So you gotta give 'em some leeway. 
NICKY (V.O.) But the bosses never believed in leeway, so listen to what they do: they... 
INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY/BACK ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
BORELLI is talking to PISCANO, his underboss. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...put Artie Piscano, the underboss of KC, in charge of making sure nobody skimmed the skim. 
BORELLI What the hell have you been doin' out there? 
PISCANO I was out there with my cumma [Italian- American slang for 'girlfriend'.] 
BORELLI Your cumma? What are you doin' with your cumma? 
PISCANO What else? I gave her a schaff [Italian-American slang for 'tap'.] 
NICKY (V.O.) The only trouble was, Piscano was a disaster. This guy could fuck up a cup of coffee. 
BORELLI Artie, what the hell have you been doin' out there, Artie? 
PISCANO I'm out there more than I'm here. 
NICKY (V.O.) And little did anybody know where this would all lead. If they did, they would have been better off makin' fuckin' novenas. 
BORELLI You gotta go back there and talk to that guy. 
PISCANO Come on, go back there? I never got paid my expenses for the last trip. 
BORELLI What expenses? 
PISCANO Well, I'm goin' all over, layin' money out of my own pocket, and I never get anything back. What the hell's goin' on? 
BORELLI You gotta go back out there. 
PISCANO Well, then, from now on, I'm gonna start keepin' records. 
BORELLI Artie, no records, Artie. What are you gonna do with records? Pay taxes? 
PISCANO Well, I keep layin' out my own fuckin' dough for these trips and nothin' ever comes back. I mean, what hell's goin' on? What are we doin' over here? 
BORELLI You're goin' out to Las Vegas, you're havin' a good time at my expense. What the fuck? I mean, after all, you're the one having a good time, not me. 
ACE (V.O.) No matter how many novenas you could make, nothin'... 
INT. TANGIERS, GREEN'S OFFICE - DAY 
GREEN is arguing with ANNA SCOTT, a fifty-year-old no-nonsense businesswoman. 
ACE (V.O.) ...was gonna stop what came up next at the casino. 
GREEN I can't believe you're doing this. 
SCOTT We made a deal. You came to me, remember? 
GREEN Yes, I appreciated your advice... 
ACE (V.O.) It turned out Phil Green, Mr Integrity, had a partner nobody knew about... and when she showed up and started demanding some money from the Tangiers... 
GREEN Why are you doing this to me? 
SCOTT Because you're wrong. 
GREEN I'm not wrong. 
EXT. ACE'S PATIO - DAY 
ACE (V.O.) (putting his sunglasses back on) And, as if things weren't bad enough... 
EXT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
ACE (V.O.) ...in comes Piscano, the Kansas City underboss. He ran that little grocery store in Kansas City where they brought the suitcases. 
INT. SAN MARINO GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
PISCANO and his MOTHER are at the counter of his elderly BROTHER-IN-LAW's store. 
PISCANO They're fightin' over those suitcases again. You know what that means, right? You know what that means, right? That means I gotta take another trip out to Vegas, and it's gonna cost me another couple of grand. 
ACE (V.O.) He ran it with his brother-in-law, but mostly what he did was complain, complain about his trips to Vegas, to his brother-in-law and to his mother, all the time. 
BROTHER-IN-LAW (Seated) You gotta lay down the law. Otherwise they're gonna make a fool out of you. 
PISCANO They're not gonna make a fool out of me. I write it all down in this book, (holding up a notepad) every fuckin' nickel that goes down. Right here, receipts... 
PISCANO'S MOTHER (Chastising her son) Hey! Oh! 
PISCANO Oh, sorry - 
PISCANO'S MOTHER What's the matter with you? 
PISCANO Receipts and bills and... everything's here. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER Since when do you talk like that? 
PISCANO I'm sorry. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER There's a lot of people here. 
PISCANO Nance gives me trouble and I'll tell him... screw around with those suitcases and I'll take the eyes out of his frickin' head. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER Again! 
PISCANO I didn't curse. I said 'frickin' head'. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER That's enough. 
PISCANO I'm sorry. 
ACE (V.O.) And what happens next? 
THE CAMERA TILTS UP TO THE CEILING AIR VENT TO A TINY MICROPHONE AND TRANSMITTER AT ITS BASE. 
ACE (V.O.) You can't believe it. I mean, who the hell would believe that the FBI had a wire in the place lookin' for some information about some old homicide about some guy who was whacked-out, God knows when, over God knows what? 
PISCANO Plus, what's to prevent him with the suitcases, that he can take what he wants?  Fuckin' Nance, he brings us back two suitcases from the Tangiers, and what about three or four? 
INT. POST OFFICE ACROSS THE STREET, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
A pen write 'NANCE' on a piece of paper. 
INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
PISCANO We got nobody in the room to watch. That's the law. You know, we can't even go into the count room to watch our money? Could you believe this cowboy bullshit? 
His MOTHER shakes her head. 
PISCANO And sure he's got his people in there. But how do you know? They could all be in on it together, those miserable fucks. 
His MOTHER reacts to his language. 
PISCANO I'll find out and, if it's Green himself, I'll bury that bastard. 
INT. POST OFFICE ACROSS THE STREET, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
A pen writes the word 'GREEN'. 
PISCANO (Over transmitter) I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes... 
INT. SAN MARINO ITALIAN GROCERY, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
PISCANO ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER All right, take it easy now, take it easy. 
PISCANO Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right. (Knocking down some bottles of olive oil.) Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER (Tapping the counter) I know, but that's enough. 
PISCANO You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me? 
PISCANO'S MOTHER I know it, I know it. 
PISCANO I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER Take it easy, though. 
PISCANO All right, all right. But I - I - 
PISCANO'S MOTHER You'll get a heart attack like that. 
PISCANO You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this. 
ACE (V.O.) And the damn... 
CAMERA PANS OFF THE LISTENING DEVICE IN THE VENT TO A WINDOW AND THE POST OFFICE ACROSS THE STREET. 
ACE (V.O.) ...thing is, they go and hear all this stuff about Las Vegas and the casinos and the suitcases, and that's it. 
PISCANO (O.S.) If I have to start handlin' things the way I... 
INT. POST OFFICE SMALL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAY 
Behind a window overlooking the grocery store are two FBI agents listening to Piscano's conversation. 
PISCANO (Over transmitter) ...did years ago, start kickin' ass, I - I'll do it, and I'll use the goddamn shovel!  I mean, I... 
We see an agent looking out of the window with a pair of binoculars. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER (Over transmitter) You are right. 
The other agent, with headphones, is seated at a desk by a tape recorder, writing. 
PISCANO (Over transmitter) ...everything's comin' out of my pocket. I gotta pay for all these trips back and forth, back and forth. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER (Over transmitter) You are right. What can I... 
INT. WASHINGTON FBI OFFICE - DAY 
PISCANO'S MOTHER (On tape recorder) ...tell you. 
TITLE IN: 'WASHINGTON, D.C.' 
THE CAMERA TILTS DOWN AN AMERICAN FLAG TO REVEAL THE TAPE NOW BEING TRANSCRIBED BY AN FBI STENOGRAPHER 
ACE (V.O.) Would you believe that such a thing could happen? 
PISCANO (On tape recorder) I'm in this to make money, not to lose money.  And... 
ACE (V.O.) Every FBI man across the country had their ears open now. 
PISCANO (On tape recorder) Because... 
The stenographer's pen writes: 'BORELLI' on a piece of paper. 
PISCANO (On tape recorder) ...if you want somethin'... 
Stenographer writes: 'TANGIERS'. 
PISCANO (On tape recorder) ...done right, you gotta do it yourself. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER (On tape recorder) Then do it the way you want. 
Pen writes: 'VEGAS'. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER (On tape recorder) What can I tell you? 
ACE (V.O.) I mean... 
Pen writes: 'SANTORO'. 
ACE (V.O.) ...Piscano, this guy basically... 
The stenographer's pen taps twice on the word 'SANTORO'. 
ACE ...sunk the whole world. 
Pen writes: 'SANTORO'. 
FOCUS ON STENOGRAPHER, LISTENING. 
PISCANO'S MOTHER (On tape recorder) That's the way people are. There are some that are good and some that are bad. 
INT. GAMING CONTROL BOARD HEARING ROOM, LAS VEGAS 1980 - DAY 
ACE is in the court with OSCAR GOODMAN, his lawyer, facing the Control Board's Chairman and six COMMISSIONER MEMBERS. The Chairman is the SENATOR we saw earlier in the casino suite taking chips out of the bureau drawer. The room is jam- packed: GREEN, GINGER, SHERBERT, as well as WEBB, reporters and other spectators. ACE's secretaries carry in legal papers. There are piles of briefs and law books on OSCAR's and ACE's table. 
OSCAR Mr Chairman and members of the Commission. Mr Rothstein is pleased to be here today. 
ACE (V.O.) And when the day finally came, I was ready. I felt so confident that all I had to do was present my case. 
OSCAR ...evidence... and we have documents, one of which is a report by retired FBI agents, which completely absolves (holding up a large file folder) Mr Rothstein from any wrongdoing. I'd like this marked, please, Mr Chairman. 
SENATOR (Into microphone) Pardon me, counselor. Before you continue... 
OSCAR No, I want to have this marked, Mr. - 
SENATOR (Into microphone) ...this, uh, this Commission is prepared to act on a motion denying the Rothstein application. 
OSCAR Denying? 
SENATOR (Into microphone) Do I hear a motion seconded? 
OSCAR Mr. Chairman - 
CONTROL BOARD MEMBER #1 (Into microphone) Mr. Chairman, I second the motion. 
SENATOR (Into microphone) Do I have a vote on the motion? 
OSCAR Mr. Chairman - 
He exits. 
FRANKIE AVALON (O.S.) ...Well, I've got a large family. 
ACE (Into microphone) How many kids do you have? 
FRANKIE AVALON (Into microphone) Uh, I'm very proud to say that we have eight children. 
ACE (Into microphone) Eight children! (He encourages the audience to applaud.) 
FRANKIE AVALON (Into microphone) No, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, no, please. 
ACE (Into microphone, to audience) That's amazing. 
FRANKIE AVALON (Into microphone) There was nothing to it. (Chuckles) It was my pleasure. 
INT. TANGIERS, GREEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
GREEN and ARTHUR CAPP are solemnly watching another episode of Ace's TV show with an elderly juggler guest. 
GREEN Ace, don't do it. 
ACE begins to juggle. 
GREEN Oh, no, no. No, no. Oh, Jesus... he's juggling! 
The audience cheers him on. 
ACE (O.S.) (From next scene) Let's not take County Commissioner Pat Webb too seriously. 
INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACES HIGH - NIGHT 
WE MOVE PAST TWO TELEVISION CAMERAS TO ACE BEHIND HIS DESK AT ANOTHER TAPING OF HIS SHOW. TRUDY IS AT HIS SIDE. 
ACE (Into microphone) I recently challenged him to a debate on this program and he declined. What are you worried about, Pat? You don't have to send me any questions. You can ask me anything you want. 
STONE (O.S.) (From next scene) What the hell is he doin' on television, anyway? 
INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE, BACK HOME - DAY 
Vegas Sun newspaper front page photo of ACE on television. Headline reads: 'Rothstein Sues Gaming Commission'. 
STONE is sitting across from GAGGI at his office. 
STONE He's on all night, screamin' about how he's gonna take his damn lawsuit all the way to the Supreme Court. He really must be crazy. He's gonna go to Washington with this? (Chuckles.) He's out of his fuckin' mind. 
ACE (O.S.) (From next scene) It's a pity in this... 
INT. TANGIERS SPORTSBOOK/ACES HIGH - NIGHT 
ACE (Into microphone) ...state that we have such hypocrisy. Some people can do whatever they want. Other people have to pay through the nose. 
INT. ALL-AMERICAN GAS STATION, GAGGI'S BACK OFFICE, BACK HOME - DAY 
ACE (O.S.) (From previous scene) But such is life. 
GAGGI Andy, go see him. Tell him maybe it's time he should quit. 
EXT. MIGHTY MART CONVENIENCE STORE, REAR PARKING LOT, LAS VEGAS - NIGHT 
SHERBERT and ACE pull up beside another parked car. ACE gets out of his car in a robe and pajamas and gets into STONE's car. 
INT. STONE'S CAR - NIGHT 
ACE First of all, what they did was totally unconstitutional. We're already on the list to be heard before the Supreme Court of the United States later this year. 
STONE These guys back home don't give a fuck about the Supreme Court and any of this bullshit! They want things to quiet down. They want you to walk away from - 
ACE Walk away? Andy, you can't be serious. How can I walk away? Don't you see what's goin' on here? Don't you see what's at stake? 
STONE The old man said, 'Maybe your friend should give in.'  And when the old man says 'maybe', that's like a papal bull. Not only should you quit, you should run! 
ACE Know what my problem is? Every time they mention my name in the papers, these cocksuckers, they mention Nicky, too. How the fuck does that help?  I mean, the heat he brought down is murder!  We had a police department who was cooperative. He's pissed them off so much now that nobody can make a move anymore. I mean, what do you do about that? 
STONE What do you propose? 
ACE I don't know, he doesn't listen to me. Maybe he should...  get lost for a while. Take a vacation. Would that be so bad? 
STONE They ain't sendin' Nicky nowhere. 
ACE All right, look, if he took a break, it would just give everybody some time to maneuver. That's all I'm saying. It's all that I'm saying. 
STONE I would forget about the maneuver. I would just get out. 
ACE (Sighs) I can't do that. 
ACE (V.O.) Of course... 
INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
JENNIFER is on the phone with GINGER; NICKY listens in. 
JENNIFER (Into telephone) You know, I don't feel like playin' tennis. 
ACE (V.O.) ...as soon as Andy got back home, Nicky heard about our talk in the car. 
JENNIFER (Into telephone) Let's go to lunch. Do you want to go to the Riviera? 
ACE (V.O.) Next morning bright and early, I get the call. 
GINGER (Over telephone) One o'clock? 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - DAY 
ACE listens in on GINGER's and JENNIFER's conversation. 
JENNIFER (Over telephone) Great. 
GINGER (Into telephone) You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go? 
INT. NICKY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
JENNIFER (Into telephone) Well, you know... 
ACE (V.O.) But just getting a call from Nicky wasn't easy anymore. Even the codes didn't work. So, we figured out another act. 
INT. FBI PHONE TAP ROOM - DAY 
A bored FBI man, seated at his desk with a tape recorder and headphones, looks at his wrist watch. 
ACE (V.O.) You see, if a phone's tapped, the Feds can only listen in...

ACE (V.O.) ...routine calls, they have to click off after a few minutes.

NICKY gives the phone back to JENNIFER. 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - DAY 
ACE gives the phone to GINGER.

NICKY (To himself) Always asking questions.

JENNIFER (Into telephone) Suzy Creamcheese has the exact... 
INT. FBI PHONE TAP ROOM - DAY 
The bored FBI agent clicks on again and hears GINGER and JENNIFER's inane conversation. 
JENNIFER (Over telephone) ...same outfit. 
GINGER (Chuckles, over telephone) But I saw something... 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, LIVING-ROOM - DAY 
GINGER (Into telephone) ...something very... cute. 
ACE sits down on the couch behind her and lights a cigarette. 
SHERBERT (Into telephone) He wants a fifty-thousand marker. 
INT. ACE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
ACE (Into telephone) No, just - just give him, give him ten. That's it. Ten.  I'll be right down. 
INT. TANGIERS BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT 
SHERBERT (To NICKY) He's gonna come up with ten thousand, just the way you wanted. 
NICKY Ten thou? No, no, no. 
SHERBERT ...give you ten thousand - 
NICKY (Grabbing SHERBERT's lapel) Fifty! I said fifty! 
SHERBERT Look, take - 
NICKY (Pushing him away and walking back to the blackjack table) Fuckin' fifty thousand!  Go get it. I don't give a fuck where you get it. (To FEMALE DEALER.) Fuckers!  They take it, but they don't want to give it back. 
NICKY turns up another bad card and looks at the dealer. She smiles as she slides the house winnings over to her side of the table. 
NICKY How the fuck can you grin? How the fuck could you grin? 
The FEMALE DEALER looks to her PIT BOSS for help. He steps up to a MALE DEALER at a neighboring table. 
NICKY You know how much I'm stuck? You give a fuck? 
The MALE DEALER walks up to the FEMALE DEALER and taps her on the shoulder. 
NICKY Do ya?! 
She lays down some cards, claps her hands to show the Eye-in- the-Sky that they are empty, and exits. 
NICKY (To departing FEMALE DEALER) Yeah. Give yourself a hand right across your fuckin' mouth. 
The MALE DEALER takes her place behind the table. 
NICKY Look at this fuckin' beaut they put in now. Sherbert send you in here to rob me now? Been fuckin' knockin' everybody's dick in all night? Huh? You been beatin' all the customers tonight, motherfucker? 
We see the PIT BOSS lock up the chip tray from the table the dealer has just left. NICKY has a diminished stack of chips and an upturned ten and a two. 
NICKY Huh, jag-off? Hit me. 
The card is a king or a 'paint', a picture card, meaning that NICKY has lost. 
Everyone freezes in fear. NICKY takes the paint and flicks it at the DEALER's chest where it sticks to his shirt.) 
NICKY Take this stiff and pound it up your fuckin' ass! Hit me again. 
The DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS who nods 'okay'. He turns over a card. It's another paint, a queen. NICKY flicks the card to the DEALER's face. 
NICKY Take this one and stick it up your sister's ass! Hit me again. 
The DEALER looks to the PIT BOSS again. 
NICKY That's it, keep lookin' at him, you fuckin' dummy. If you had any fuckin' heart at all, you'd be out fuckin' stealin' for a livin'. (Tossing the card at the DEALER.) Hit me again. 
The DEALER looks at the PIT BOSS. 
NICKY What the fuck you keep lookin' at him for, huh, you fuckin' pu- 
The DEALER deals him another paint. 
NICKY Look at this, twenty fuckin' paints in a row. Hit me again! 
ACE enters the casino with SHERBERT. 
MARINO (To NICKY) He's here. 
NICKY (To the DEALER) You should pay as fast as you collect, you know. 
NICKY gets up to go over to ACE, glowering at SHERBERT as he walks past. 
ACE and NICKY are partially hidden behind a pillar by the slot-machines. 
ACE What are you doin'? You gotta get out of here! 
NICKY Hey, Sammy, tell this Jew motherfucker over here to pay that marker. 
ACE Nicky, Nicky, you're not listenin' to me. I'm here to help you. What's the matter with you?  You're gonna bury us both. 
NICKY Just give me the money. Fuckin' give me the fuckin' money, Sammy. 
ACE I'm gonna okay you ten and get you even, and that's it. Then you got to get out of here before the cops and the newspapers are all over you. 
To the PIT BOSS, holding up ten fingers. 
ACE Ten and that's it. 
He makes a throat cutting gesture with his hand. ACE leaves. NICKY turns to walk back to the table. He sees SHERBERT standing right behind him. 
NICKY What are you starin' at, you bald- headed Jew prick?! 
Before SHERBERT can answer, NICKY grabs the receiver off a wall phone and hits him across the face and back. SHERBERT falls to the floor. NICKY pulls the cradle off the pillar and tosses it down on his back. He and MARINO walk back to the table, SHERBERT winces on the floor in shock. 
NICKY Sue me, you Jew fuck! 
MARINO Let's get out of here. 
NICKY What? Get out of here? I got a marker comin'. 
He puts some chips down on the table. 
NICKY (To DEALER) Deal. 
INT. OSCAR, THE LAWYER'S OFFICE - DAY 
ACE and GINGER are seated across from OSCAR, their lawyer. 
OSCAR I know, but everything's changed now. You're talking about a divorce. You're even asking for alimony payments and... child support... and now custody. 
GINGER I just want what any divorced woman would get. 
ACE I mean she's only sober about two hours a day. It's usually from eleven in the morning until one in the afternoon. And if I gave her her money and her jewels now, you know what she's gonna do? She's gonna piss it all away in about a year, and then where will she be? (To GINGER.) Where would you be then? Comin' right back to me, right back to me. (To OSCAR.) Or finding some other excuse to come and I - I - 
GINGER (To ACE) We had a deal. Remember that? (To OSCAR.) He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave. 
ACE (To GINGER, leaning closer to her) Look in my eyes. Look in my eyes. 
GINGER turns to him. 
ACE You know me. Do you see anything in these eyes that makes you think I would ever let someone in your condition take my child away from me? (Pause.) Do you?  You know that won't happen. 
ACE (V.O.) And after all this time... and as hard as I tried, as much as I wanted... 
INT. ACES HIGH BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR/SHOWGIRLS' DRESSING-ROOM - DAY 
ACE, with Kleenex sticking out of his collar to protect his shirt from his television make-up, walks back to the dressing room with TRUDY. She pecks his cheek before exiting to her own room. A security guard opens the door for ACE. 
We follow him past numerous showgirls and costumes. 
ACE (V.O.) ...I could never reach her. I could never make her love me. I always felt she should have gone for all that money... being somebody for the first time in her life, a home and a kid. But that's not what happened. It just didn't work out that way. 
ACE (To the showgirls) Everything all right? 
ACE I mean, what could we do? After a while, we'd just take breathers from each other. You know, little separations. At that time, I remember Ginger took Amy and went to Beverly Hills. She was gonna spend a week or so shopping. 
ACE picks up the phone at a make-up table.

NICKY Ginger - 
He's cut off by ACE who points to the passenger's side of his Cadillac. NICKY walks around and gets in. ACE starts the engine to make it harder for anyone to listen in on their conversation. 
ACE turns the volume down. He looks straight ahead, away from NICKY. 
NICKY (After an awkward moment) Ginger called me. 
ACE (Polite, careful, smoking a cigarette) Yeah. 
NICKY I just told you. She called me. 
ACE And what'd she want? 
NICKY She was afraid to call you. 
ACE Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy. 
GINGER Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out. 
ACE Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want? 
NICKY I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right? 
ACE (Sighing) I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know... (Pause.) She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy. 
NICKY I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back. 
ACE She's driving me fuckin' crazy. 
NICKY Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know?  But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?

EXT. LAS VEGAS PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT 
ACE sees GINGER and AMY coming off the Tangiers private jet. GINGER wobbles a little as she comes down the ramp.

INT. ACE'S CAR - NIGHT 
AMY looks on from the back seat. 
ACE So, what'd ya do with it? 
GINGER With what? 
ACE With the money. 
GINGER He needed some clothes. 
ACE (Sighs) Twenty-five thousand for clothes. 
GINGER He wanted a watch, too. 
ACE Twenty-five thousand for clothes and a watch. 
GINGER Mm-hm. 
ACE Mm-hm. 
MAITRE D' (O.S.) (From following scene) Mr. R... 
INT. VEGAS RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
ACE and GINGER, dressed for dinner just like any other couple, walk towards a table overlooking the colorful lights of downtown Vegas. 
MAITRE D' ...good evening. Signora. 
GINGER Gino. 
MAITRE D' This way. 
ACE (V.O.) (as they are led to their table) The good part was, I had Amy back. So, we went home, had the housekeeper stay over, put the kid to bed, I calmed myself down and we went to dinner. I tried to keep things nice and civil, you know.  But... hey, twenty-five thousand for three suits? That doesn't make much sense. 
ACE (Seated across from GINGER at a booth) First of all, he's not gonna wear f- thousand-dollar suits. But let's say he did, which he won't. How you gonna get fitted for twenty-five suits in three days?  I, um, I mean, how could you get fitted that fast? I can't get fitted that fast, and I pay twice as much. 
GINGER I bought him a watch too. 
ACE Yeah. 
GINGER Yeah. 
ACE But even if you bought him a watch, a really nice watch, one that he thought was nice - and he doesn't know what the fuck a good watch is - so, you go, five, ten, twelve grand? 
GINGER Yeah. 
ACE At the most, which is impossible for him. 
She glances to the table behind them. 
ACE Plus, at the most, three suits, a thousand apiece. That still leaves what?  Around ten thousand? 
GINGER (Staring down at her plate, trying to restrain herself) Would you knock it off, Sam? 
ACE I'm just tryin' to figure it out. 
GINGER There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out. 
She lights a cigarette. 
NICKY I mean, listen, two people don't get along, at some point you gotta call it... I mean, it's none of my business, but I ... I think that's what you gotta do. You gotta take it somewhere - 
GINGER (Smoking a cigarette) Oh, you're right, I know.  It's... well, I was just - 
NICKY What? What? 
GINGER Nothin'. 
NICKY What were you gonna say? Go ahead. 
GINGER I don't - (Sighs.) 
NICKY Tell me what you were gonna say. Go ahead. 
GINGER Yeah? 
NICKY Yeah. 
GINGER Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank...  could help me get my jewelry out?  There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out. 
NICKY (Pauses) Let me think about that. 
GINGER Okay. 
NICKY See who I got in there. Gotta get somebody I can trust. 
GINGER Mm-hm. 
NICKY You know? 
GINGER Yeah. 'Cause, you know, (leaning her head back) He's never gonna give me my jewelry. 
NICKY Hm. 
GINGER He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass. 
NICKY (Chuckles) Yeah, right. That's Sammy. And he's probably got it there too. 
Takes a sip of his drink. 
GINGER He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me. 
NICKY No, he wouldn't. I would have. (GINGER chuckles.) And he'd've been right, too. I mean, seriously. (She cuddles closer to him.) Well, there's one thing you don't do. You don't take a guy's kid and then take off. 
GINGER (Quietly) I didn't. (Chuckles.) I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back. 
NICKY You did. You're right. 
GINGER Exactly. 
NICKY embraces her. 
NICKY You did. I like that. I like that. That's what I like about you. You did the right thing. 
GINGER (Playing with his jacket) I did what you told me to. 
NICKY Yes, you did. 
GINGER 'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do. 
NICKY Yeah. (Pause, with his arm around her.) Boy, he really fucked himself up out here - (She caresses his face.) - didn't he? 
GINGER Sure did. 
NICKY Everything went to his head. (He sighs, rubbing her neck.) 
NICKY/GINGER (In unison) Changed. 
NICKY He did. He ain't the same person, right? 
GINGER (Whispering) No, he's not. 
NICKY He really thinks who the fuck he is, I'll tell you that. 
GINGER (Holding back tears) Exactly. (Sighs.) He hates me. 
She rests her head on NICKY's shoulder, starting to weep. 
GINGER He hates my fuckin' guts. 
NICKY Come on, come on, you're a toughie. You can take this. (Runs his hand down her cheek.) Don't cry. 
GINGER (Crying) I'm not as tough as you think I am. 
NICKY Yes, you are. 
GINGER (Sobbing) I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do. 
NICKY (Whispering) Come on. Don't be scared. 
GINGER (Softly, through tears) I need some help. I do. I need some help. (Strokes his chest.) You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky. 
GINGER's sobs subside a little and her hand starts to stroke NICKY's neck. 
GINGER (Whispering) I do. I need a new sponsor. 
NICKY (Quietly, cheek to cheek) Is that what you want? 
GINGER Yeah. 
NICKY A sponsor. 
GINGER Yeah. 
NICKY Mm... okay. Don't worry about it. Nobody'll fuck with ya anymore. I'll take care of ya. 
GINGER (Whispering) Nicky, please... 
NICKY Yes, I will. It's what you want, isn't it? Huh? 
GINGER (Sobbing) Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
NICKY It's what you want? 
GINGER Yeah. Uh-huh - 
NICKY interrupts and kisses her. She kisses him back. He pushes her head down to his lap.

GINGER Hi. 
She puts her purse and the groceries down on the kitchen counter, and hangs up the dry cleaning. 
ACE Hi. You didn't answer your beeper. 
GINGER I threw it away. 
ACE You threw it away? 
GINGER (As she puts some items away) Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore. (Stopping suddenly.) Where's Amy?

FLASHBACK - A LITTLE EARLIER 
BLUE is yelling back at the COPS, holding the foil package. 
ACE (V.O.) ...because they thought his hero sandwich was a gun! 
Freeze frame as the camera moves in on the wrapped sandwich in his hand. 
ACE (V.O.) You know, they could have... 
The COPS walk up to BLUE, who is on the ground amid shattered glass. 
ACE (V.O.) ...been right, but who knows?

GINGER screams and attacks NICKY. 
NICKY (Grappling with her) What? Hey! Hey! What the fuck are you... ? 
NICKY slaps her roughly across the face, grabs the back her jacket and forcefully leads her to a stairway. 
GINGER Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole! 
NICKY Get the fuck out of here. Get out! Get the fuck out! 
Shoves her down the stairs. GINGER yells and gasps on her way down. 
MARINO (O.S.) (From bottom of stairway) Whoa. Calm down. 
NICKY (Behind GINGER) Get out. Get out! Get out! 
MARINO (O.S.) Take it easy! 
NICKY Why'd I get involved with this fuckin' nut in the first place? Get out! 
MARINO You're gonna fuckin' kill her. Take it easy. 
NICKY (Pushing a sobbing GINGER out the back door) Get her the fuck out of here. Get her out of here. 
EXT. LEANING TOWER, BACK DOOR/REAR PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
MARINO throws GINGER out the back door. She falls on her side, crying. 
NICKY Get the fuck out of here. 
GINGER (Sobbing, getting up) I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money! 
NICKY All right, all right. 
She stumbles to her car. 
GINGER I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore! 
NICKY All right. Be careful. 
GINGER You fucked with me for the last time! 
NICKY Okay, yeah. 
INT. LEANING TOWER, BACK DOOR - NIGHT 
NICKY and MARINO are seated at the back door watching GINGER screech out of the parking lot. 
NICKY Be careful. (To MARINO.) Hey, come on. Get inside. 
They turn and walk back inside. MARINO leans on a wall next to the kitchen. 
NICKY has scratches on his hand and face. 
NICKY Can you fuckin' believe that? (Showing MARINO his scratches.) Look at this motherfucker. 
NICKY sits on the bottom step across from MARINO, who sighs. Cooks mill around in the background. 
NICKY I fucked up, Frankie. I fucked up good this time. Should have never started with this fuckin' broad. 
MARINO Take it easy. What could you do? I mean, she threw herself at you, right? 
NICKY I'm in a bad fuckin' spot here. You know that? Bad fuckin' spot. 
He puts his head in his hands.

ACE Fine, fine. How's your family?

GINGER (Kneeling, to COP #2) I just have to get this one more thing and then we'll be - We can go. (She picks up an empty shoe box.) Shit! (Gets up, picking up a pair of ACE's shoes and tossing them on the floor.) God, fuck! Shit! God! (She runs out, taking a fur coat off a hangar. Then, grunting) Really pisses me off... (To COP #2.) Don't worry about it. 
COP #2 follows her out of the closet. 
EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - MORNING 
ACE, COP #1 and several neighbors wait as GINGER storms out with COP #2 carrying a small overnight bag. 
GINGER (To the COPS but looking at ACE) And it would be great if you guys could follow me out of here, because he's been threatening me. 
GINGER walks to her car. 
COP #2 (To COP #1) Come on. I'm sorry. 
COP #1 Okay. 
ACE (to COP #1, shaking hands) Okay, Randy. Thank you.

ACE (Into telephone, throwing the scissors into the open drawer) Charlie, you've gotta - you've gotta stop her! 
CHARLIE CLARK (Over telephone) I-I'm sorry, Sam. 
ACE (Into telephone) You've got to stop her. 
CHARLIE CLARK (Over telephone) What can I do? 
ACE (Into telephone) She's a fuckin' junkie. She's out of her fucking mind.  Do you unders- 
SHERBERT is behind ACE, listening. 
CHARLIE CLARK (Over telephone) She has... 
INT. VEGAS BANK - MORNING 
CHARLIE CLARK is on the phone. GINGER, in the background, comes out of the vault and carries one of her boxes to a cubicle. 
CHARLIE CLARK (Into telephone) ...the keys, and it's still in both your names. 
GINGER (Carrying the box, slipping but catching herself) Whoa. 
CHARLIE CLARK (Into telephone) I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. I'd like to help... 
INT. ACE'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS DEN - MORNING 
CHARLIE CLARK (Over telephone) ...but I can't.

GINGER Shit! Oh, goddamn it! 
GINGER gets down on the floor to pick them up. 
GINGER (Then, to COPS who are watching) Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay? 
COP #1 (To COP #2) Go get a bag, man. 
GINGER (Looking up, offering COP #1 some cash) And here. Here. 
COP #1 Lady, I can't. I can't. I ca-

COP #1 (Taking the money) I can't. 
INT. VEGAS BANK - MORNING, A LITTLE LATER 
COP #2 holds open a large canvas bag for GINGER. 
COP #2 (To GINGER) Like this? 
GINGER (Struggling with two handfuls of cash) Yeah, just hold the top open, all right, and I can - 
She starts to stuff the money in the bag. 
EXT. FBI SURVEILLANCE CAR, ACROSS THE STREET - MORNING 
The FBI AGENTS photograph GINGER leaving the bank. 
EXT. VEGAS BANK - DAY 
GINGER throws the canvas bag into the trunk of her car when, suddenly, she sees ACE's beat-up Cadillac approaching. She gasps. 
GINGER Oh, God. It's him. (To COPS.) You have to stop him. You have to - 'Cause he said he was going to kill me. 
ACE jumps out of his car and runs toward GINGER, SHERBERT follows him out.

COP #1 Mr Ro- Mr Roth- Mr Rothstein, where you goin' - 
ACE Stop -

ACE Hey! 
COP #1 Hold on a second. 
The COPS huddle around ACE and SHERBERT until GINGER's car pulls out of the bank. 
COP #1 Nothin' we can do about it. Nothin' we can do. There's nothin' we can do. 
ACE, unable to pursue, watches GINGER speed away. 
ACE Look, look. You can't stop her for speeding? I mean, look what the hell she's doing.

PISCANO'S WIFE Artie! Artie! 
FBI AGENT #10 We can't help him if - 
EXT. ACE'S HOUSE - DAY 
ACE opens his front door and is confronted by two FBI AGENTS. He is shown pictures of NICKY and GINGER at the construction site. 
ACE (V.O.) (Quietly) And at the end of the day, they finally came to see me with the pictures. 
FBI AGENT #1 (Pointing to the pictures) Why protect a friend who betrayed you like that? 
ACE (V.O.) But I didn't want to look at 'em. I didn't want to look at the guys who brought 'em either. 
ACE refuses to look at the photos and quietly closes the door on the AGENTS. 
INT. FEDERAL COURT-HOUSE - DAY 
GAGGI, FORLANO, BORELLI and CAPELLI are all in court. FORLANO and CAPELLI are breathing through masks and oxygen tanks with nearby doctors and nurses. GAGGI 
has a cane in front of him. Several court spectators look on. We hear the bosses' lawyer speak. 
LAWYER Your Honor, as you can see, my clients are elderly and infirm. Any incarceration could pose a serious health risk. They are no danger to the community and they pose no flight risk. 
NICKY (V.O.) When the bosses were arrested, some of 'em were so old they needed doctors at their arraignment. 
LAWYER And Pre-trial Services recommends that bail remain as presently set. 
JUDGE (Calling a recess) We're going to take a ten-minute recess. 
The JUDGE pounds his gavel. 
NICKY (V.O.) And when it looked like they could get twenty-five years... 
The BOSSES, their nurses and lawyer file through a side court door. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...to life in prison, just for skimmin' a casino... sick or no fuckin' sick, you knew people were gonna get clipped. So, the day of the arraignment, they had this meeting right in the back of the court-house. 
INT. COURT-HOUSE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
The BOSSES are gathered around a conference table as the lawyers and nurses silently walk out the door as if on cue. 
NICKY (V.O.) See, when something like this happens, you know how things are gonna work out. It's always better with no witnesses. So, what about Andy? 
THE CAMERA PANS FROM ONE BOSS TO THE OTHER. 
FORLANO (Putting down his oxygen mask once the door behind him is shut) He won't talk. Stone is a good kid. Stand-up guy, just like his old man. That's the way I see it. 
BORELLI I agree. He's solid. A fuckin' Marine. 
CAPELLI (Holding his oxygen mask) He's okay. He always was. Remo, what do you think? 
GAGGI (Pause) Look... why take a chance? At least, that's the way I feel about it. 
EXT. BACK HOME RESTAURANT, STRIP MALL PARKING LOT - DAY 
ANDY STONE and his LAWYER are walking toward their car. 
STONE You call Artie... and you tell him I don't care what, he's gotta be in my office Thursday morning before eleven o'clock. 
LAWYER It's done. 
His LAWYER veers to the left, walking away from STONE who keeps talking. 
LAWYER (O.S.) It's done. 
STONE (To himself) It's terribly important. I gotta have a conversation with this guy. That's all. 
GAGGI's men, CURLY and BEEPER, appear from behind STONE and shoot him dead. 
They empty their silent half-load rounds into STONE even after he's down on the snowy ground. They walk away discreetly, leaving him partially hidden between cars. 
NICKY (V.O.) As much as they liked him, I mean, he wasn't one of us. He wasn't Italian. As far as they knew, he could have talked. Otherwise, Stony might still be alive. 
MONTAGE OF MURDERS: 
EXT. NANCE'S COSTA RICAN HOUSE - DAY 
TITLE IN: COSTA RICA 
The camera moves down a waterfall to reveal NANCE's Spanish- style house. 
NICKY (V.O.) The first one to skip was John Nance. He found a nice, warm secluded place in Costa Rica. He thought nobody would find him there. 
Several gunshots are heard. NANCE emerges from the house through a door and runs along a verandah to another door. He breaks a pane of glass, unlocks another door and runs in. BEEPER emerges from the first door and follows him back into the house. Several more shots are heard. NANCE emerges from yet another door, only this time he's been shot in the stomach. He painfully staggers away from the hitmen. 
NICKY (V.O.) But, then, his kid got nabbed by the Feds for drugs, and so naturally the bosses were afraid he'd come out of hidin' just to save his kid and give 'em all up.  So... 
CURLY and BEEPER come out of the house and approach NANCE from behind. 
CURLY Hey, where you goin', jag-off? 
NANCE kneels down. CURLY points his gun expertly at the top of NANCE's head and fires. Blood splatters from NANCE's mouth and he falls to the ground. The gunmen walk away. 
NICKY (V.O.) But anyway, they, you know, they all had to follow. 
EXT. HOLE IN THE DESERT - DUSK 
A bound COUNT ROOM EXEC and a CLERK are kneeling next to a large pit in the esert ground in front of BEEPER and CURLY. 
NICKY (V.O.) Everybody went down. 
The CLERK groans as he's shot in the head by BEEPER. Blood splatters and he falls right into the pre-dug hole. 
COUNT ROOM EXEC Go ahead, fuck... 
CURLY Fuck you. 
CURLY shoots the EXEC in the head, he too falls backward into the pit. The gunmen fire more rounds into the bodies, then toss their guns into the hole. 
NICKY (V.O.) Before you knew it... 
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
RICHIE, a sharply dressed Tangiers EXEC, is getting into his new Lincoln. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...anybody who knew anything wound up gettin' whacked. 
CURLY sneaks up from behind and hits the EXEC with a lead pipe. He puts a plastic bag over his head and begins to choke him to death. The EXEC struggles a bit but the bag soon fills with blood. CURLY strikes him with the pipe one last time. 
INT. BEVERLY SUNSET MOTEL - NIGHT 
The camera pans away from an empty registration desk to a motel corridor. 
GINGER (O.S.) (Gasping) Oh! Oh, no!  No... 
The camera moves past several rooms along a cinder block wall. 
ACE (V.O.) After Ginger took off, she wasn't much help to anybody. She found some pimps, low-lifes, druggies and bikers in LA. And in a few months, they went through all the money and all the jewels. 
Suddenly, a door opens and GINGER overdosing, staggers into the hall looking for help. She gasps, goes halfway down the seedy corridor towards the desk, but collapses and dies. 
FREEZE FRAME ON GINGER SPRAWLED OUT ON THE MOTEL CARPET. 
ACE (V.O.) After they found her body... I had a private doctor do another autopsy. He said they gave her... a hot dose. In the end... all she had left was thirty-six hundred in mint-condition coins. 
END OF MONTAGE 
EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY 
ACE emerges from the restaurant, smoking a cigarette as in the first scene in the film. He gets into his car to start the ignition. 
ACE (V.O.) No matter what the Feds or the papers might have said about my car bombing... 
Flames surge from the windshield, concealing ACE behind the wheel. 
FLASHBACK: EXT. TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY 
The sign above him reads: 'Tony Roma's a Place for Ribs'. ACE is leaving the restaurant and walking to his car. 
ACE (V.O.) ...it was amateur night, and you could tell. Whoever it was, they put the dynamite under the passenger side. But what they didn't know, what nobody outside the factory knew, was that that model car was made with a metal plate under the driver's seat. It's the only thing that saved my life. 
ACE opens his car door and gets in. 
INT. ACE'S CAR, TONY ROMA'S RESTAURANT PARKING LOT - DAY 
ACE turns on the ignition and we see two- and three-inch flames come out of the defroster vents. Everything goes silent as he is suddenly engulfed in flames. 
The car explodes in flames two storeys high. The screen fills with the rising explosion of smoke and fire. 
ACE (V.O.) The bombing was never authorized, but I suspect I know who lit the fuse. 
EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY 
NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of a car on a farm road for a meeting. FAT SALLY, a heavy-set wiseguy, is already there. 
FAT SALLY (O.S.) Hey, Nicky. 
ACE (V.O.) And so did the power that be. 
NICKY Hey, Mikey, how's your hernia? 
They shake hands. 
FAT SALLY How you doin'? 
MARINO approaches NICKY from behind. 
NICKY (V.O.) It took months for... 
FLASHBACK: EXT. MIDWEST CORNFIELD - DAY 
NICKY's car drives up the farm road to meet his crew. 
NICKY: (V.O.) ...everything to calm down, but finally my guys got out on bail and the bosses wanted me to send my brother Dominick out to Vegas.  Always the dollars, always the fuckin'... 
NICKY, DOMINICK and MARINO get out of the car to greet FAT SALLY. HARDY, FUSCO and BEEPER are also waiting there, smiling. 
NICKY (V.O.) ...dollars. I mean, it was still way too hot for me to even go near Vegas, so I set up a meeting with the guys way out in the sticks. I didn't want my brother to get fucked around. 
NICKY shakes hands with SALLY. FUSCO walks up to say hello. 
NICKY (V.O.) I mean, what's right is right. They don't give a fuck about - urgghh!

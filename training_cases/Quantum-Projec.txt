QUANTUM PROJECT: ORIGINAL SCREENPLAY 
1     INT.  A BIOCHEMICAL LANDSCAPE                            1 
A violent electrical storm.  Veins of light pulse outward, branching off into a spidery network of 
GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS 
We are inside a human brain.  A pack of neurons FIRE OFF to the left, and rocket their way across synapses to the optic nerve.  Passing the eye socket, they speed toward a silky, curvilinear membrane (the retina) on which we see an image projected: 
AN UPSIDE DOWN COMPUTER SCREEN 
Neurons PING into the membrane: the picture suddenly FLIPS RIGHT SIDE UP and we follow the light, flashing in a blur through the iris and cornea until, exiting the eye we reverse POV and 
2     EXT.  THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT - DAY                      2 
CLOSE ON A PAIR OF EYES 
Deep deep blue.  Radiating more intelligence than wisdom.  Inside each pupil is the reflection of a COMPUTER SCREEN.  A deferential VOICE sounds from off camera. 
VOICE Professor Pentcho? 
3     INT.  ATOMIC LABORATORIES  (PROFESSOR PAUL PENTCHO) - DAY3 
ARLETTE Done. 
Next to the elevator, two plants are dying in their pots, their growing lamps off.  Pentcho looks around, finds the plug, pushes it into the socket.  The lights glow.  He peers at a leaf: a tiny bug crawls across... 
GUIDE (OC) ...at the moment of impact the electrons inside the pipe are travelling six hundred sixty six million miles per -- 
ARLETTE We need to progress. 
He breaks out of it, swipes his I.D. card.  The capsule doors WHOOSH open.  Pentcho nods at the man inside.  This is JACQUE, his accent heavily Italian. 
JACQUE Hey, it is 3-P-O!  P, P, P!  Professore Paulo Pentcho! 
PENTCHO That's not an official nickname, Jacque. 
Pentcho looks from Jacque to Arlette, who blushes.  Pentcho sits down in the heavily consoled captain's chair. 
JACQUE Beh!  Eets just tun-nel humor. 
The giant lab disappears from sight as they DROP twenty stories below the earth. 
PENTCHO Did they recalibrate the 3k turn? 
Jacque nods.  They hit bottom.  Pentcho keys in data on the console computer as the capsule moves LATERALLY on a track parallel to the beam pipe, stopping in front of the RF CAVITY, bursting with a billion dollars worth of nanotechnology. 
More thought text scrolls by on the field, now in RED LETTERS: "I'm having a psychotic episode." 
The field collapses back into PENTCHO, ashen-faced, watching his computer screen, and seeing: the cursor (electron) blinking. 
JACQUE'S VOICE Impact! 
Suddenly, we are back inside the pipe, HURTLING toward 
KABLOOM!  THE SUB-ATOMIC EXPLOSION 
A particle meteor shower of magnificent proportions.  They glow and charge off and disappear, as the laws of E=mc2 take visual flight inside this billion dollar kaleidoscope. 
8     INT. AIRPLANE IN 1ST CLASS (ON PENTCHO) - DAY            8 
staring out the window, not really seeing the clouds as we SURGE into his eyes and CLICK 
9     INT.  THE BRAIN FIELD (POPPING OPEN) - DAY               9 
stacking up windowlike flashbacks with startling ferocity. 
The glowing electron - CLICK -  Arlette: "multi-tasking again?" CLICK - the capsule doors closing - CLICK - "you're having a psychotic episode" - CLICK - the echo of the electron's voice: "WHAT DO YOU WANT, PAUL?" 
10     INT.  THE AIRPLANE (PENTCHO) - DAY                      10 
THE GLASS SLIDES ACROSS THE OPEN TRAY TABLE 
Suddenly a horn BLARES, and CRASH! 
14     INT/EXT.  THE BEETLE (PENTCHO) - DAY                    14 
SLAMS into the car in front of him, triggering 
SLOW MOTION EFFECT 
A three car COLLISION with Pentcho in the middle, an object lesson in physics seen from ten different camera angles: 
SCREECH CRUNCH CRUNCH 
Bumpers crumple, metal tears, human molecules SNAP forward.  POP POP POP!  Like gunfire, bullet AIRBAGS clamp the drivers' heads back against their headrests. 
15     INT. PENTCHO'S BRAIN - DAY                              15 
The field ROCKS SIDEWAYS, in total OVERLOAD, so flooded with messages that each one is undecipherable. 
16     EXT.  THE FREEWAY ACCIDENT SITE - DAY                   16 
The three cars form a tangled metal sculpture.  Incredibly, as Pentcho himself sees, they are all RED VW BEETLES.  He sits in a daze.  A man's voice interrupts, scaling up into a SHOUT. 
CLICK - THE PICTURE SHARPENS 
on a man and a woman, MAKING LOVE on a big brocade couch.  Their bodies rock in unison, faces unseen. 
SINGER'S VOICE (CONT'D) My aim is true-ooooh. 
The field collapses closed upon: 
19     EXT.  THE FREEWAY ACCIDENT SITE - DAY                   19 
A woman from the Durango is approaching, as Will, back on the phone, argues with his boss. 
WILL I'll be there, Trent.  Yes.  20 minutes -- 
Click.  Will reddens, sees the sunglassed face of the woman, looking past him and over to PENTCHO, signing the tow truck papers.  The battered front end of his Beetle CRANKS upward. 
WILL (CONT'D) Son-of-a-bitch.  As if it was my fault I got rear-ended by... 
The woman stares, curiously, at Pentcho. 
WILL (CONT'D) ...some schmuck dreaming about God.  Mia? 
She doesn't hear him.  Takes off her sunglasses, slowly.  Wide-set brown eyes. 
Mia brushes back a strand of hair.  Bites her lip. 
PENTCHO (CONT'D) I've been dreaming about you. 
MIA Day or night? 
Pentcho loses himself in her brown eyes. 
PENTCHO Both. 
Atoms are vibrating, interchanging by the billions.  Another voice gets in the way. 
WILL'S VOICE Mi. 
PENTCHO Is that your... 
MIA No. (beat) Not yet. 
She shifts her weight from one slim leg to the other. 
PENTCHO Could we go somewhere? 
MIA I'm heading out of town. 
as the Durango motors into the alpine landscape.  Mia turns, looks at her former lover.  He stares back, smiles. 
MIA Why am I doing this? 
PENTCHO It's an experiment. 
Mia turns onto a private road.  A MANSION appears in the distance, cresting the hill. 
23a     EXT/INT.  XANADU - NIGHT                               23a 
A massive wooden door.  Mia holds a flashlight, slips an oversized key into the lock and turns. 
POV: THROUGH THE DOORWAY 
An enormous hall.  Scaffolding rises from the stone floor.  Forty foot high walls are draped in thick sheets of plastic. 
They enter like thieves. 
23b     INT.  XANADU - A SHORT TIME LATER                      23b 
Mia stands on top of an eight foot riser.  Pentcho passes up harnesses and rope to her outstretched hands. 
MIA We flopped the first time out. 
SUCKED OUT OF EXISTENCE... 
as Pentcho's eyes stare for a millisecond at 
THE VOID.  NOTHINGNESS.  NADA. 
And then he's FALLING again, accelerating toward his own last particle collision, when a VOICE murmurs from somewhere. 
VOICE (OC) I'm not done. 
THWACK!  The safety line holds, dangling Pentcho a meter above the stone floor. 
23d     INT.  XANADU - SOME TIME LATER                         23d 
They camp on old couch cushions, side by side, staring up at the illuminated fresco.  Pentcho is bruised, battered, vulnerable. 
PENTCHO When I was a kid I used to snap my head back like a gunfighter on the draw, hoping to catch a glimpse behind me. 
Mia props her head up on one elbow. 
MIA Of what? 
ON THE FRESCO: A CHORUS OF ANGELS 
PENTCHO That's what it asked me.  "What do you want?"  I didn't answer.  I was in the middle of an experiment. 
MIA Like now? 
He hesitates, then surrenders to the fact. 
PENTCHO Yes. 
The firefly dances above them.  Pentcho sits up (and away from her). Mock serious: 
PENTCHO (CONT'D) Did you know electrons have lovers? 
Mia notes his distance.  Faces him, cross-legged. 
MIA No.  I didn't.  (dryly) I'm listening. 
PENTCHO Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier... 
She looks, sees him disappear into his head. 
PENTCHO (CONT'D) A strip of silicon, which for you and me would be like... 
The vulnerability is gone.  And Mia, with it. 
30     EXT.  THE BAY AREA - DAY                                30 
Storm clouds gather over the ocean. 
31     EXT.  THE BERKELEY HILLS - POURING RAIN                 31 
A taxi stops in front of a two story cottage, looking abandoned in the wet weather.  Pentcho walks out, passing his dented VW BEETLE in the driveway.  Ascends a flight of brick steps to the: 
32     INT.  PENTCHO'S COTTAGE - ENTERING                      32 
An alternately stark and cluttered space, less lived in than occupied by a man on the run between his office and his mind. 
Rivulets of water run from an open window, across a large desk, and down onto the wood floor.  Pentcho scans around, unfazed.  Locates a towel.  Mops up.  Dries off the computer and keyboard.  Bag still on his shoulder, he fires up the machine and logs 
ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN 
E-mail.  Lots of it.  Hundreds and hundreds of messages scrolling by on the screen.  He turns away, sees his own rain soaked clothes forming a puddle on the floor.  LIGHTNING cascades across the sky, visible through the large bay window behind the desk.  Pentcho's eyes stray back to the screen 
STILL SCROLLING E-MAIL MESSAGES 
as the thunder follows almost immediately.  CRACK!  He looks up: Veins of light pulse outward, branching into a spidery network 
OF GLOWING INTERCONNECTEDNESS 
on the exact same path toward...  KABOOM!  THE RED BEETLE. 
A plume of smoke rises out of the punctured roof. 
35     (OMIT)                                                  35 
36     (OMIT)                                                  36 
37     INT.  THE AIRPLANE - NIGHT                              37 
Pentcho sits in his window seat, staring at the open tray table next to him.  There's a glass.  It doesn't move. 
37a     EXT.  STOCK SHOT - LANDING IN LAX                      37a 
The plane touches down.  We see the landmark spider-restaurant. 
38     EXT.  CAR RENTAL FACILITY - NIGHT                       38 
Pentcho crosses the lot with the rent-a-car EMPLOYEE. 
EMPLOYEE Rented every last ve-hicle.  'Cept one. 
PENTCHO I'll take it. 
Crumpled on the floor, hands still clutching his chest.  The screen COLLAPSES at the sound of 
42     EXT. HOUSE (VOICES SHOUTING FROM THE CORNER) - NIGHT    42 
Foreign voices, jabbering at high speed.  Policemen BARK BACK on loudspeakers.  Walkie-talkies. 
Pentcho RAPS ON THE GLASS.  He's frantic.  Harder now.  A THUNK sounds from inside.  Or was it?  He picks one last key out in the glare of the blue lights.  Jams it in the lock.  Twists and 
43     INT.  THE HOUSE - PENTCHO                               43 
bursts into the darkened foyer.  His foot catches on a thick doormat. He SPRAWLS forward as 
A GUNSHOT ERUPTS ABOVE HIS HEAD 
He drops, convulsed with fear.  Snaps his head back to see: 
THE EINSTEIN MAN (ALEXANDER) 
in bathrobe and slippers, hands shaking around a shotgun. 
ALEXANDER Paul... Pauly... 
Pentcho struggles to breathe.  Staccato: 
PENTCHO You taking any medication? 
Alexander's eyes FLARE in anger. 
ALEXANDER Don't waste it Pauly.  This is not an everyday talk.  Just input the information and ask relevant questions.  One: how did a celebrated life of the mind bring me (pulling the gun out) to this particular switching station? 
PENTCHO Dad... 
He shoves the shotgun into an open trash can. 
ALEXANDER Two: what if I didn't miss? 
PENTCHO You did. 
ALEXANDER Spare me your classical answer. Measurements in.  Results taken.  What if I didn't miss? 
PENTCHO You did miss -- 
ALEXANDER -- What if your seven and a half precious liters were downloading over the parquet floor?  What then?  (softer) What did your life mean? (beat) Who did you nurture, Pauly?  Who did you love? 
Pentcho shifts, uncomfortably, in his seat.  Ditto Alexander's mood. He does a startling one-eighty into nonchalance. 
ALEXANDER (CONT'D) What was her name? 
INT.  ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - A SHORT TIME LATER 
Pentcho paces in front of the open window, stops.  He turns to walk out, is surprised by 
ALEXANDER 
Standing in the dark. 
ALEXANDER We've been kidding ourselves, Pauly.  Until you look for it, it doesn't even exist. 
45     EXT.  SAN PEDRO WHARF - NIGHT                           45 
Pentcho slogs down the wharf.  Running from it.  Looking for it. Past homeless people slipping in and out of the shadows.  He snaps his head back over his shoulder, sees an OLD WOMAN playing  the accordian.  She stops.  Her eyes bore in on his own. 
OLD WOMAN You would have a son with me... 
Pentcho blinks.  The woman is suddenly FIFTY YEARS YOUNGER: 
YOUNG OLD WOMAN ...and his name would be Hope. 
46     INT.  PENTCHO'S BRAIN - (A MATHEMATICAL FORMULA)        46 
Numbers fly up on the field, are inscribed, erased, considered and measured.  Pentcho's own VOICE is heard on overlap: 
The old sash falls shut.  BOOM.  It's like a dam bursting inside him, only the flood is LAUGHTER that starts deep in his belly, as a giggle, then a chuckle that cascades upward and out into enormous GUFFAWS.  The sound rocks the house.  Pentcho's smile is a mile wide. His eyes sparkle, then tear up as the 
FRONT DOORBELL RINGS 
He jumps off the bed, and bounds down the stairs. 
53     INT. THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT                             53 
Alexander's already there, ushering MIA inside to: 
54     INT.  THE LIVING ROOM - AT THE MOMENT THAT              54 
Pentcho arrives.  He stops, incredulous, at the sight of her. 
ALEXANDER Guess who's coming to dinner. 
Mia jumps right in.  To Pentcho: 
MIA I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time. 
PENTCHO Wait.  I want to tell you something. 
He takes her arm, steering her away from Alexander, into the living room.  She stops cold at the sight of the MURAL. 
MIA So I can move on.  You too. 
A horn blares from outside. 
MIA (CONT'D) Be who you are, Paul.  I love who you are. I do. 
She turns and runs out the front door. 
55     EXT.  ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - SECONDS LATER - NIGHT         55 
Mia runs down to the curb where where boyfriend WILL holds open the passenger door of the red Durango. 
MIA'S VOICE I'll drive. 
She circles the car, disappears behind the wheel.  Will gets in his side. 
ON THE FRONT PORCH 
Pentcho, agitated, pushes open the door.  Alexander's already outside, watching Mia motor off.  He turns, stares at his son. 
ALEXANDER Do you want to think about it some more? 
PENTCHO SPRINTS DOWN TO THE CURB.  Jumps into the Beetle.  The headlights FLASH ON in the pre-dawn night. 
VOICE AND TEXT (CONT'D) A web of connections created by the interdependence of all things... 
The field collapses back into: 
59     INT.  MIA IN THE DURANGO (DRIVING) - NIGHT              59 
eyes on the rear view mirror, as a horn BLARES from the entrance to the Long Beach bridge. 
She re-checks the mirror, filled with bobbing headlight beams.  One beam LOCKS ON, straight into the center of the glass, blinding her for a split second.  She blinks.  Gasps to herself as the beam seems to 
LIFT OUT OF HER MIRROR 
and train its phosphorescent glow on: 
MIA - EXTREME CLOSE UP 
the point of light reflecting out of her pupils.  PENTCHO'S VOICE speaks from nowhere, sonorous and packed with reverb: 
PENTCHO'S VOICE What do you want? 
Mia blinks again.  The beam is gone.  She looks over at WILL, oblivious, checking his watch. 
BACK ON MIA

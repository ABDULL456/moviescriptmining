AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME 
By 
Mike Myers 
MUSIC: timpani roll and dramatic sting 
NARRATOR In his last adventure, Austin Powers, a swinging spy from the Sixties, was unfrozen in the Nineties to battle his archenemy Dr.  Evil. Austin foiled Dr. Evil's plan to send a nuclear warhead to the center of the earth and banished him into space forever. Or so he thought. 
EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT (ESTABLISHING SHOT FROM FIRST MOVIE)

Elegant double doors with a brass plaque reading "Honeymoon Suite." A "Do Not-Disturb" sign hangs from the handle. 
INT. HOTEL SUITE 
FROM THE FIRST MOVIE: Austin and Vanessa snuggle in bed. She plays with his chest hair. 
VANESSA I love you, Mr. Powers.

EXT. HOTEL BALCONY 
EXISTING FOOTAGE: Austin and Vanessa gaze at the stars. 
AUSTIN Look how beautiful the night sky is. 
VANESSA Isn't that the big dipper? 
AUSTIN Yeah, and that looks just like Uranus. 
VANESSA Austin! 
AUSTIN (sheepish) Well, you know. 
VANESSA Hey, I've never seen that big star before. 
AUSTIN Yeah, what is that? 
Austin pulls out his telescope and takes a look.

INT. DR. EVIL'S CAPSULE 
DR. EVIL This isn't over yet, Mr. Powers. I have one more trick up my sleeve, don't I Mr. Bigglesworth? 
The frozen Mr. Bigglesworth MEOWS. 
EXT. SPACE 
The Bob's Big Boy rocket. Suddenly, a hatch opens in Bob's rear end and Dr. Evil's silver egg capsule poops out. 
SFX: PLOOP! 
CREDIT APPEARS MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT Blocking his penis lengthwise as he walks. 
NUDE BEACH - CREDIT SEQUENCE 
A girl sits on a blanket; a HORIZONTAL CREDIT blocks her bare chest. Austin lays on his back beside her, trying to be suave; A VERTICAL CREDIT appears. 
The wind blows away a kite, revealing a stark-naked girl. The credit "PRODUCTION DESIGN" blocks her chest; the credit "BY" blocks her you-know-what. Austin walks into frame; the "PRODUCTION DESIGNER'S NAME" disguises his growing interest. 
Austin joins a nude volleyball game in progress. CREDITS appear everywhere to block all possible combinations of nudity. People leap in all directions to make saves, causing CREDITS TO APPEAR at crazy angles. 
A pretty girl watches Austin lift weights. Her boobs are blocked by the "WRITTEN BY" credit. 
Austin lifts a dumbbell. The credit "MIKE MYERS" sticks out from his waist. Austin looks proud. 
A BUFF NAKED BODYBUILDER joins them. He lifts a much heavier weight. A much longer credit sticks out from his waist: "AND MICHAEL MCCULLERS". Austin pouts. 
Austin runs down the beach, his bum blocked by the credit "DIRECTED BY". He jumps on a trampoline and does the splits in mid-air: 
FREEZE FRAME AND PAN AROUND LIKE IN THE GAP "KHAKI SWING" AD.  Austin smiles crazily, his penis blocked by "JAY ROACH." 
Austin does a super-duper double flip into his JAGUAR. 
AUSTIN Shaguar, baby, yeah! 
CU on the chrome script on the grill: it reads "Shaguar" where it would normally read "Jaguar". 
The car speeds off. 
FULL SCREEN TV JERRY SPRINGER SHOW 
On the stage we see a Klansman father and his Klansman son, a Nazi father and his Nazi son, and SCOTT EVIL all seated on a panel. 
Lower Third Chyron: "MY FATHER IS EVIL AND WANTS TO TAKE OVER THE WORLD"  JERRY SPRINGER 
If you just joined us, today's topic is "my father is evil and wants to take over the world". Now, Bobby, you had something you wanted to share with your father before the break. 
BOBBY Dad, I know you're against race mixing and all that, but I met someone... 
KLANSMAN Don't say it! 
The crowd WHOOPS. 
BOBBY I met someone... and he's black. 
The crowd goes crazy. 
KLANSMAN He? 
The Klansman holds his hooded head in his hands. 
JERRY SPRINGER Please welcome Tim. 
A handsome Blair Underwood look-alike enters and hugs the Klansman's son. The crowd screams. 
JERRY MOVES TO SCOTT EVIL. 
JERRY SPRINGER Now Scott, tell us about your father. Share with us. 
SCOTT Well he's the head of an evil organization that has aspirations for world domination. 
JERRY SPRINGER And where is your father right now? 
SCOTT He's in outer space, like frozen in a giant egg and stuffed inside a Big Boy rocket with his cat, Mr. Bigglesworth. 
JERRY SPRINGER Really? Well, we have a surprise for you, Scott. Let's bring out 
SCOTT'S father, Dr Evil. 
Dr Evil enters. 
INT. STARBUCKS WORLD HEADQUARTERS 
Number Two smiles weakly, breaking into a sweat on his brow. 
NUMBER TWO May I add, I appreciate you reinstating me after our little... misunderstanding. 
DR. EVIL Frau Farbissina. Wie gehts is einen? 
We see Frau. She looks a little more 'masculine' than before. 
FRAU Zehr gut, Herr Doctor. 
DR. EVIL How are things? 
FRAU I have come to embrace the love that dare not speak it's name. To my right is my lover. 
We see a severe-looking German woman with one continuous eyebrow. 
FRAU Her name is Unibrau. I met her on the LPGA Tour. 
DR. EVIL Right on. Welcome, Unibrau. 
Dr. Evil takes another sip of cappuccino, making the frothy milk mustache even larger. 
FRAU Doctor, you have a 'milk mustache.' 
DR. EVIL (wiping it off, embarrassed) Oh, I know. I know. 
NUMBER TWO Dr. Evil, I'd like to introduce the Greek assassin, Oedipus. 
We see a swarthy Greek army guy. 
DR. EVIL Welcome to my private army, Oedipus. Excited? 
OEDIPUS I could give a shit. 
DR. EVIL Kiss your mother with that mouth? 
OEDIPUS Yes. 
DR. EVIL Of course you do. 
Dr Evil begins to press a button labelled "Oedipus" on his control panel, but Number Two interrupts. 
NUMBER TWO (clearing throat) Dr. Evil, as you know, the rate at which you liquidate henchmen far exceeds our ability to replace them. 
DR. EVIL I have so few pleasures left to me, Number Two. The key to life is to rotate your vices. One day it's executions, another day it's creamy French cheese.  It's like frickin' heroin. 
NUMBER TWO Well, Dr. Evil, perhaps I have the answer. While you were frozen, we began a program to clone you. 
DR. EVIL Cool. 
NUMBER TWO We had a few glitches, but I think you'll be pleased with the results. 
FRAU (shouting) Send in the clone! 
MUSIC: dramatic sting We see the shadow of an approaching figure. The shadow looks like Dr. Evil, only much larger and scarier. 
NUMBER TWO He is identical to you in every way, except he is one-eighth your size. 
We see that the source of the shadow is a MINIATURE DR. EVIL, just like the creepy mini-Marlon Brando in The Island of Dr. Moreau. He mimics Dr. Evil's mannerisms including holding his tiny pinky to his tiny mouth. 
DR. EVIL Breathtaking. I shall call him Mini- Me. (to clone) Mini-Me, you will sit to my right. 
Mini-Me sits down in a miniature version of Dr. Evil's command chair. 
DR. EVIL Come Mr. Bigglesworth! 
The bald Mr. Bigglesworth runs and jumps into Dr. Evil's lap. A bald MR. BIGGLESWORTH KITTEN jumps into Mini-Me's lap. 
As Dr. Evil walks to the center of the room, chairs rise from the floor. Everyone takes a seat, but Dr. Evil gets caught in the middle as chairs rise around him. He is frightened. One of the rising chairs hits him in the crotch. 
DR. EVIL OK, people, we now officially have a chair problem. If another one of these chairs hits me in the nuts, I'm gonna go postal. Mini-Me, I want you to meet Number Two. 
NUMBER TWO Hello there. 
Mini-me says nothing. 
DR. EVIL Mini-Me? 
Mini-me still says nothing. 
DR. EVIL Shy. Low blood sugar. (to room) Gentlemen, Phase Two is beginning. I have an operative inside the Ministry of Defense. By this time tomorrow, Austin Powers' mojo will be mine. 
Dr. Evil goes over and looks out the large window. 
DR. EVIL (maniacal laugh) Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! 
EXT. DR. EVIL'S TROPICAL ISLAND - 
We cut outside to see that window is in fact the left eye of a Mt. Rushmore-type depiction of Dr. Evil carved into the side of a volcano on a tropical island. 
DR. EVIL (V.O.) (maniacal laugh) Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha! 
INT. MOD - CRYOGENIC FREEZING ROOM - 
We see Austin's FROZEN BODY in cryogenic storage. Above it, we see two digital clocks. One reads: 
CURRENT DATE: MAY 25, 1969, the other reads: DATE FROZEN: NOVEMBER 11, 1967. One of the SCOTS GUARDS, is an IMMENSELY FAT SCOTTISH SOLDIER (played by Mike Myers). 
BRITISH COLONEL We've had reports that there's a spy in the Ministry of Defense.  The contents of this room are vital to the country. Be on special alert. 
FAT SOLDIER (thick Scottish accent) Those bastards will have to kill me before I let anything happen to this wee naked hairy popsicle, sir! 
BRITISH COLONEL Very good. And try and lose some weight for God's sake! 
They exchange salutes and the Colonel exits. 
FAT SOLDIER Yessir! (sotto after the Colonel) I outta smash your teeth out with a Toffee Hammer Mr. English Colonel Telling-Me-What-To-Do-And-Stealing- our-Oil-Refusing-To-Recognize- our- Scottish-Independence! 
The Fat Soldier begins to play the BAGPIPES, a white vapor comes out of them, filling the room. 
The other soldiers COLLAPSE, unconscious. 
He bores through the ice and pulls out a Sixties high-tech syringe type device with an LED graph on the side. He places it in Austin's navel. The LED meter goes from red to green, indicating FULL MOJO. 
EXT./INT. AUSTIN'S SHAGUAR - DRIVING - DAY 
Austin drives in MODERN TRAFFIC. He is drinking a STARBUCKS COFFEE and listening to the Jag's in-dash CD PLAYER. Suddenly Austin DROOPS. The car starts to sputter. The fuel gauge reads empty. 
AUSTIN Gor blimey, I'm on empty! That's funny, I just filled the Shaguar up this morning. 
Austin hits a button on the dashboard. 
BASIL EXPOSITION appears on the picture phone in the dash. 
BASIL EXPOSITION (on picture phone) Hello, I'm Basil Exposition, head of British Intelligence. 
AUSTIN You always are, Basil. Listen, the weirdest thing just happened, I've run out of petrol. 
BASIL EXPOSITION We'll send a man around immediately. How was your honeymoon? 
AUSTIN Vanessa tried to kill me, Basil. She was a Fembot! 
BASIL EXPOSITION Ah women, who can understand them? Moving on, let's discuss your new case. 
AUSTIN New case? Very shagadelic, Basil! 
BASIL EXPOSITION You'll be doing a photo shoot. We know that one of the models is an ex- KGB agent selling top secret material to the highest bidder. 
AUSTIN And... done! I'm spent! 
Austin throws his camera to Reg, who catches it. 
REG Hel-lo, you forgot about Ivana. 
AUSTIN I didn't forget, baby. Miss Humpalot and I are going to have a 'private session'. 
Reg shows the girls out as they PROTEST. Austin and Ivana are left alone. Austin CLAPS TWICE and the lights dim. He CLAPS again and the fire goes up. 
MUSIC: I'm Never Going To Fall in Love Again by BURT BACHARACH 
IVANA When did you get "The Clapper"? 
AUSTIN November, 1964, Dutch East Indies, shore leave. 
IVANA Are you cold, Mr. Powers? 
AUSTIN I once had a bad experience with frostbite. I had to dip my tadger into a brandy snifter. 
Ivana moves over to a chessboard set up nearby. 
IVANA Do you know how we keep warm in Russia? 
AUSTIN I can guess, baby. 
IVANA We play chess. 
AUSTIN I guessed wrong. 
IVANA It takes a keen intelligence to play chess. Of course, you know what they say about men with big brains, don't you? 
AUSTIN They wear large hats? 
IVANA No, they make better lovers. 
AUSTIN Wrong again. 
Ivana starts playing with the chess pieces sexily (like in The Thomas Crowne Affair). 
IVANA I assume you know how to play. 
She runs the bishop across her lips sexily. 
AUSTIN Of course.  The... horsey... moves in an L shape. 
Austin tries to match her sexy moves and CHOKES on a piece. 
AUSTIN Let's stop playing games with each other... especially difficult ones. May I ask you a question, Miss Humpalot? 
IVANA Of course. 
AUSTIN Do I make you horny? Do I? 
Austin rolls around on the polar bear rug. 
IVANA I'll tell you anything you want to know, just make love to me. 
She pulls his shirt off, revealing his prodigious chest hair. 
IVANA You are hairy, like an animal! 
AUSTIN (growling and barking) Grrrr, baby. 
Austin takes the head of the bear skin rug. 
AUSTIN Grrrr. Ruf! Ruf! (covers the bear's eyes) Wait a tick, I don't want him watching me while I'm on the job! 
IVANA Make love to me, monkey man. 
Austin takes a peak-- nothing. He is panicked. 
FELICITY Oh, that was so relaxing. Felicity stretches very sexily. 
AUSTIN Would you 'like to see my etchings? 
FELICITY (sexy) I think I'm ready for bed. 
She moves close to Austin. He slides to the other side of the bed. 
AUSTIN I'll get you some PJs. 
FELICITY No, I'm ready for bed. 
She moves over to him. He avoids her. 
AUSTIN Oh, you'll want to clean your teeth then. 
Austin holds up toothpaste and toothbrush. Felicity finally grabs him and pins him to the bed. 
FELICITY No, I want to have sex with you, Austin. 
AUSTIN Hello Vicar! 
FELICITY I've studied everything about you- your methods, your accomplishments, your preferences. You're the reason I became a spy. Now, I've waited two years to meet you, so I say we get busy making up for lost time. 
Austin sits up. 
AUSTIN (reflective) Felicity, I used to think that way, too, but I guess... I guess I've changed.  Not to make a short story long, or to ramble on and on, or to keep talking in a repetitive manner ad infinitum until it becomes impossible to remember what I was talking about in the first place, but- where was I? 
MUSIC: SAD INSTRUMENTAL 
AUSTIN Oh yes. Felicity, I can't shag you. I've lost my mojo. 
FELICITY (obviously disappointed) Oh. 
AUSTIN I thought coming back to the Sixties would bring it back, but it hasn't. 
FELICITY Austin, don't worry. I know just the man to help you. He's my guru. Ringo recommended him and he's the best. 
AUSTIN I'll warm up the Jumbo Jet, baby! 
EXT. AUSTIN'S PSYCHEDELIC JUMBO JET

EXT. INDIA - STOCK FOOTAGE 
EXT./INT. BEETLE 
Austin and Felicity drive against obvious rear screen projection of India. 
INT. ASHRAM 
It looks like a mosque, with incense, tapestries, and DISCIPLES.  Austin and Felicity enter. 
MUSIC: SITAR 
FELICITY There he is. That's my guru. 
We see the GURU PITKA (played by Mike), an Indian man in a bright red sari. 
FELICITY Guru, I'd like you to meet Austin Powers. 
AUSTIN How are you baby? 
GURU PITKA My chakras are aligned and I am in a perfect state of equipoise. 
AUSTIN Good on ya. I don't know what that means but it sounds fab. 
AUSTIN That's my problem. 
GURU PITKA Ohhhhh, I get it. (beat) No, I don't get it. 
FELICITY He's impotent! 
AUSTIN Alright, easy. (to Guru) Felicity and I were all set for some hump Olympics and I couldn't bat for six. 
GURU PITKA Oh, yes, I see. 
AUSTIN You have no idea what I'm saying, do you? 
GURU PITKA Not a word. 
AUSTIN Guru, I've lost my mojo. 
GURU PITKA Oh, mojo! You should have said so. Well, you've lost your mojo because your chakras are misaligned. You have lost love. 
AUSTIN Lost love? Oh, you mean Vanessa? 
FELICITY Who's Vanessa? 
AUSTIN She was an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil. I couldn't have loved her. 
GURU PITKA Denial ain't just a river in Egypt, buddy. You will only get your mojo back when you surround yourself with love. 
AUSTIN Oh, I get what you're saying now! He's talking about free love, baby! Tune in, turn on, and drop out! 
GURU PITKA I am talking about true love. You must stay and study until you are worthy. 
AUSTIN No way, man. The only way to surround yourself with love is to throw a swinging shin-dig! Yeah, baby, yeah! 
INT. DR.EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR 
Dr. Evil and Frau are interrupted by the man we now know as FAT BASTARD. He is foul-mouthed, and when he swears he is bleeped. 
DR. EVIL Well done, Fat Bastard. May I have the mojo? 
FAT BASTARD First things first, where's your shitter? I've gotta bleepin, turtle head pokin' out. 
DR. EVIL (disgusted) Right. Charming. Fat Bastard- you don't mind me calling you Fat Bastard do you? 
FAT BASTARD I've got a lot of demons kickin' around in my noggin, but weight issues ain't one of them. 
DR. EVIL Alright, Fatty- 
FAT BASTARD The name is Fat Bastard!  I'm the incorrect weight for my height and I was born out of wedlock, hence the moniker Fat Bastard. Hey, I'm not kiddin'. I've got a crap on deck that could choke a donkey. 
DR. EVIL Fat Bastard, the mojo? 
FAT BASTARD Where's my (bleeping) money? 
DR. EVIL A gentlemen never discusses money. 
FAT BASTARD Fine, you can take your (bleep)in' money and shove it up your (bleep), you stupid (bleeping) prick! While you're at it you can suck my greasy, two-toned (bleep)! 
DR. EVIL (pause) Vulgarity is no substitute for wit. 
FAT BASTARD (Bleep) you! 
DR. EVIL Right. Bring in the money. 
Dr. Evil PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIERS drive in a forklift loaded with gold bars. 
FAT BASTARD Alright, here it is. 
Fat Bastard slowly draws out the high-tech syringe full of MOJO. 
Dr. Evil is mesmerized. 
NUMBER TWO Dr. Evil, what are we going to do about Powers? 
DR. EVIL Fat Bastard, in addition to being extremely rotund, you're a vicious killer. 
Take care of it. 
FAT BASTARD It'll be my pleasure. 
DR. EVIL It's an easy job. Without his mojo, Powers will be...powerless? 
INT. AUSTIN'S PAD - NIGHT 
A party, packed with dancing freaks of every stripe, is in full swing. A girl dances in an oversized birdcage. 
AUSTIN This shag-in is gonna blow your mind, baby, yeah! 
The party sequence is shot like Laugh-In. Very fast cuts to the music. 
Austin sees a VERY PREGNANT WOMAN drinking a martini and smoking.  He gently lifts her drink and cigarette away from her. 
PREGNANT WOMAN Hey! 
AUSTIN You'll thank me later, baby. 
Another angle. Austin and Felicity dancing. 
AUSTIN (noticing someone) Hey! Ricardo Monteblan, how are you? 
We see RICARDO MONTEBLAN -smoking a hukka on a round chair. 
RICARDO Hello, Austin! Balls, said the queen and the king laughed because he had too. 
AUSTIN (to camera) Crazy, man! 
FELICITY Let's split up and scope the scene. 
AUSTIN Don't do anything I wouldn't do- at least not without me. 
Felicity slaps Austin on the butt as he walks off. 
AUSTIN Oh, behave! 
CUT TO: 
Austin at the bar with an exotic-looking mod chick. 
AUSTIN (to chick) You're very exotic, baby. Do you have a little English in you? 
CHICK No. 
AUSTIN Would you like to? 
CUT TO: 
An Alan Zeus-type very gay guy. 
ALAN ZEUS GUY (rolling his eyes) This is ridiculous! 
CUT TO: 
A LONDON COP and Felicity are on hanging chairs. 
LONDON COP Have you ever been picked up by the fuzz? 
FELICITY No, but I bet it really hurts. 
CUT TO: 
A GUY IN A RAINCOAT on a tricycle, shot undercranked, rides through the party and falls over. 
AUSTIN That's not a pretty sight. Who is he? 
FELICITY Until recently he worked security for the MOD, but we think he might be a double agent, possibly for Dr. Evil. 
AUSTIN How do you know? 
FELICITY We've noticed that his lifestyle has changed dramatically. He's made a lot of cash purchases, he's hanging out with foxes half his age, and he's becomes quite a fixture on the London party circuit. 
AUSTIN Who's the girl? 
FELICITY I don't know, but it looks like he's splitting. 
Fat Bastard exits. 
FELICITY I'll follow him. You see what you can get out of the girl. We'll rendezvous later. 
Felicity follows Fat Bastard out the door. Austin makes his way over to the girl. 
AUSTIN Hello, hello. 
GIRL Hello, Mr. Powers. Fab party. 
AUSTIN Who are you today, baby? 
GIRL Robin. Robin Swallows. 
AUSTIN Swallows? That's an interesting name. Are you English? 
ROBIN SWALLOWS German, actually. My maiden name is Spitz. 
AUSTIN Well which is it, baby, Spitz or Swallows? Either way, it's a pleasure. 
ROBIN SWALLOWS The pleasure is mine. 
She extends her hand. Austin takes it and shakes. As he shakes, her cleavage undulates like jello. Austin is transfixed and keeps shaking far too long. 
AUSTIN Charmed, I'm sure. (still shaking, her breasts jiggle) How do you do? (still shaking, jiggling) Yes, quite. (shakes, jiggles) I always enjoy meeting new people. (shakes, jiggles) How's your mum? Good. (shakes, jiggles) I love shaking hands. 
Austin. is shaking her hand so vigorously that she is in danger of popping out of her dress. 
AUSTIN (snapping out of it) So, who was your friend? 
ROBIN SWALLOWS His name is Fat Bastard. 
AUSTIN It suits him. 
ROBIN SWALLOWS He's my lover. 
Austin is grossed out. 
AUSTIN OK. Would you happen to know if he's in business with a man named Mr. Evil? 
ROBIN SWALLOWS I don't know anyone named Dr. Evil. 
AUSTIN Really? I said Mister Evil. Austin does a smug take. 
AUSTIN Something to drink? Would you like a Mister Pepper? 
ROBIN SWALLOWS Yes, I'd love a Doctor Pepper. 
AUSTIN Really? I said Mister Pepper. 
Austin does another smug take. Robin grabs Austin and pulls him close. 
ROBIN SWALLOWS You're a groovy boy, I'd like to strap you on sometime. 
AUSTIN Oh, behave! 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Felicity is in bed, naked under the sheets, smoking a cigarette.  We hear strange sounds offstage. 
We pan over to reveal she's IN BED WITH A NAKED FAT BASTARD! 
He is eating a huge turkey leg, his face covered in food. 
FAT BASTARD I always get (bleep)in' hungry after I get my end away! 
FELICITY I never would have thought that a man of such tremendous girth could be such a, um, creative and sensuous lover! 
FAT BASTARD You want some chicken? I have more! 
He rolls over to reveal his HUGE NAKED ASS. 
Felicity takes a homing device out of her purse, looks around for a place to plant it. She sees his enormous butt cleavage and realizes that there's only one place for the thing to go. 
ANGLE on FAT BASTARD'S face. He is delighted. 
FAT BASTARD Frisky are we? Alright lets have another go! 
She is horrified. 
INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR - MAIN ROOM 
Dr. Evil at his table with Frau, Scott, and Number Two. 
DR. EVIL Get me the President of the United States. 
The PRESIDENT appears on Dr. Evil's video screen with his ADVISORS behind him. 
INT. OVAL OFFICE (SPLIT SCREEN) 
PRESIDENT Dr. Evil, what do you want? 
DR. EVIL Not what I want Mr. President, but I will receive. In 12 hours I will destroy Washington, DC with a giant laser. 
Dr. Evil reveals a giant laser. Mini-Me is humping it like a dog. 
DR. EVIL OK, Mini-Me, why don't you and the laser get a frickin' room. Honestly. (to President) I will destroy another major city every hour- that is, unless you pay me- 
SNAP ZOOM 
DR. EVIL One hundred billion dollars! 
The President and his advisors LAUGH. 
PRESIDENT Dr. Evil that's more than the entire federal budget for 1969. 
DR. EVIL Don't play games with me. The capitol will disappear if I don't receive 
SNAP ZOOM 
DR. EVIL One hundred billion dollars! 
His advisors LAUGH. 
PRESIDENT That much money simply doesn't exist. I don't think l00 billion is even a number. It's like saying I want a kajillion bajillion dollars. 
His advisors LAUGH. 
DR. EVIL Come on, Mr. President... 
SNAP ZOOM: 
DR. EVIL "Show me the money!" 
Dr. Evil looks around smugly. No one laughs. 
FELICITY Not details, just what it's like. You know, what's the scene?  Where's it at? 
AUSTIN There've been a lot of advances in the Nineties, baby. The economy is stable, people take better care of their health concern for the environment is on the rise and, um, let's see, there's an entire television channel dedicated to golf. 
FELICITY Sounds awful. 
AUSTIN It's not so bad once you get used to it. The Nineties are about responsibility. You know, having respect for yourself and other people. I even got married. 
FELICITY You? Married? What about the sexual revolution? 
AUSTIN Well, it turns out there were some casualties, baby. Don't you think you'll ever get married? 
FELICITY No, not until I get a little more 'experience' under my belt. 
AUSTIN Oh, behave! 
Suddenly Austin notices something outside and puts his hand to his mouth in fear. 
AUSTIN (wide-eyed) Oh my God! 
Felicity is immediately on her guard. She pulls her gun. 
FELICITY (looking around) What is it! Is it Fat Bastard? 
AUSTIN No, written here on my hand, see? 
Austin turns his hand around to show her. He has written 'oh my God' on his hand with the pen. 
AUSTIN Says 'Oh my God!' 
They laugh. 
FELICITY Austin, look. 
Austin and Felicity duck into a CAMERA SHOP and come out an instant later with SUPER-8 CAMERAS. 
They run down the street filming each other. 
AUSTIN AND FELICITY - SUPER-8 MONTAGE 
This is a Richard Lester-like sequence shot on grainy film from Austin and Felicity's POVs. 
There's lots of SPEEDED UP stuff and POPPING IN AND OUT of frame like the MONKEES TV show. 
BACK ON THE STREET 
AUSTIN Felicity, I haven't had this much fun since I worked undercover in Amsterdam-- '66 I think it was. 
FELICITY 1965, actually. You posed as a Dutch cheese expert to stop Dr.  Evil from poisoning the world's water supply. 
Austin is impressed. 
FELICITY I've studied your file, Austin. I want to be a trailblazer, just like you.  The Seventies are right around the corner. It's going to be a glorious time for fashion and music and technology-- it won't be long before every flying car has its own 8-track. 
Austin starts to say something, then bites his tongue. 
FELICITY The CIA has always been a boy's club until now. Well move over, this chick's taking over. 
AUSTIN (hoarse) Very impressive. 
FELICITY Austin, your voice! 
AUSTIN Yes, I think I'm coming down with something. 
Austin and Felicity stop at an ICE CREAM MAN with his pushcart. 
AUSTIN I'll get some ice cream. Would you like some? 
FELICITY No thanks. 
AUSTIN Get down! 
Felicity ducks. Austin reaches back and pulls ROBIN SWALLOWS from the back seat and USES HER AS A SHIELD. 
FELICITY We're obviously on the right track. (re: tracking screen) It looks like Fat Bastard is-on an island in the middle of the ocean. 
EXT. DR. EVIL'S ISLANDNIGHT 
We hear the BEEP-BEEP of the tracking screen. 
EXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - NIGHT 
The Beetle comes from under the water and lands on the beach. We still hear the BEEP-BEEP. 
EXT. TENT - WOODS - NIGHT 
Austin and Felicity have set up a tent with a view of the Dr.  Evil Mt. Rushmore face. Austin is looking at the mountain through a pair of binoculars which hang around his neck. 
AUSTIN According to the readings, Dr. Evil's headquarters is over the next ridge. 
FELICITY Can I have a look? 
AUSTIN Sure. 
Austin hands her the binoculars. Unfortunately the strap is still around his neck, pulling his face into her cleavage. 
FELICITY Question is, how do we get in? 
AUSTIN (muffled) Mmmmmmm...mmmmm... 
FELICITY Austin, did you hear me? 
AUSTIN I seem to be stuck in your dirty pillows. 
FELICITY Where are the topographical maps that Basil drew up? 
AUSTIN I think they're in the tent. 
He and Felicity enter the tent. A LIGHT is on inside casting shadows of Austin and Felicity on the side of the tent. From the outside it appears the shadow Austin is leaning over with his back to-the shadow Felicity, who appears to have her hands up his butt. 
AUSTIN (V.O.) Have you got it out yet? 
FELICITY (V.O.) Good Lord, Austin, what sort of things do you put in there? 
The shadow Felicity appears to be tugging a string of sausage links from his ass. 
AUSTIN (V.O.) Oh, anything that catches my fancy. 
FELICITY (V.O.) How do you manage to fit it all in? 
AUSTIN (V.O.) Oh, it stretches to fit. 
The shadow Felicity appears to pull a tennis racket out of Austin's ass. 
AUSTIN (V.O.) Are you almost done? I can't hold it much longer. 
INT. TENT 
We see that Austin is leaned over holding part of the tent. 
Felicity is rummaging through a duffel bag across the tent. 
FELICITY Here we go, one hammer. It's amazing how much this duffel bag will hold. 
INT. DR. EVIL'S VOLCANO LAIR 
We see Dr. Evil playing a piano. We pan to see Mini-Me on top of the piano, himself playing a miniature baby grand. 
DR. EVIL (singing) 'WHAT IF GOD WAS ONE OF US? JUST A SLOB LIKE ONE OF US?' 
Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, Scott, Number Two and Frau are seated. 
FAT BASTARD Christ Almighty, it smells terrible in here. 
DR. EVIL It's the volcanic sulphurous emissions. We've put up some air fresheners. 
FAT BASTARD Great, now it smells like someone took a shite in a pine tree. 
NUMBER TWO Dr. Evil, the laser has been loaded into the rocket. You're ready for launch. 
DR. EVIL I'm just waiting to taunt my nemesis. I have so few pleasures, you know. 
Austin and Felicity are brought in at gunpoint by Private Army Men. 
DR. EVIL Ah, Mr. Powers, Ms. Shagwell, welcome to my hollowed-out volcano. 
AUSTIN We meet again, Dr. Evil. 
DR. EVIL Yes, the only reason I'm keeping you alive is so you can feel the agony of watching my plan unfold. 
AUSTIN Dr. Evil your plan will never-- 
Austin trails off as he spots his MOJO in the beaker behind Dr.  Evil. 
DR. EVIL Oh, is that yours? 
AUSTIN My mojo! 
DR. EVIL You know what they say: finders keepers, loser weepers. 
FELICITY Dr. Evil, do you like real estate? 
DR. EVIL Of course. Why? 
Felicity kicks Dr. Evil in the balls. 
FELICITY Now you've got a couple of achers. 
DR. EVIL Oww! My stomach hurts! 
AUSTIN (wincing) I don't care if he is evil, you don't give a man a shot in the pills. It's just not cricket, baby. 
DR. EVIL Take them away. 
The guards lead Austin and Felicity away. 
SCOTT She just hoofed you in the sack and you're going to leave them alone in a jail cell with one inept guard? They'll escape, dipshit. You do this every time! 
DR. EVIL You're going the right way for a smacked bottom, young man. 
SCOTT You don't own me! 
DR. EVIL I do actually. (pulling out paper) It's complicated. Usually it's illegal but this buddy of mine... but I digress. Fat Bastard, I'm leaving you in charge. I'm going up the moon to hold the world ransom with my giant laser, I shouldn't be long. 
FAT BASTARD What about Powers? 
DR. EVIL He's tucked away safely in his cell. He's harmless without that mojo. Guard it with your life. (to Number Two) Number Two, begin the countdown. 
The area around Dr. Evil's command chair, including the time portal behind it, is enclosed by a circular door, becoming part of the rocket. Steam begins billowing, etc. 
NUMBER TWO Five, four, three... 
EXT. VOLCANO ISLAND (CHEAP BLUE SCREEN) 
NUMBER TWO (V.O.) Two, one, liftoff! 
The rocket lifts off from the volcano into the night sky. 
EXT. NIGHT SKY (CHEAP BLUE SCREEN) 
AUSTIN No, baby, you're right. I was wrong to judge you. I guess I am... jealous. 
FELICITY But the Austin Powers I knew was wild and crazy and free. He could never be jealous. 
AUSTIN That Austin is gone. I've changed. I knew someone, not long ago, a very special woman. She taught me that life isn't about jumping into the sack with whoever comes along, it's about caring and responsibility. And while it is true she turned out to be an evil robot minion of Dr. Evil, I suppose I really did... love her. 
FELICITY Was that your wife? 
AUSTIN Yes, Vanessa. 
Felicity is touched. 
FELICITY Listen, Austin, I can't pretend to understand everything you've gone through, but I trust you. I'll make you a deal: if we get out of here alive, I'll give monogamy a try. 
AUSTIN With me? 
FELICITY Yes, silly. 
AUSTIN Groovy, baby! 
They kiss. 
FELICITY We need to lure the guard inside and get his key. 
AUSTIN Alright, what if I pretend to be desperately ill with food poisoning? The guard, drawn by my cries of pain, will come to investigate.  Meanwhile, you dig a pit and line it with makeshift punji sticks made from sharpened toothbrushes. The guard falls in, Bob's your uncle, and we've got the key.  What do you think? 
FELICITY That might work, but how about this? 
Felicity charges towards the window in the door, ripping open her blouse as she goes, showing her breasts to the guard. We, however, can't see them. 
FELICITY (giving a wolf whistle) What do you think of these, my man? 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CELL 
The guard is mesmerized by Felicity. 
GUARD Mommy... 
He unlocks the door and enters. 
INT. JAIL CELL 
The guard enters an apparently empty cell. We see that Austin is wedged spread-eagle above the door, ready to pounce. 
FELICITY (seductive, to guard) It's very hot in here, don't you think? 
The guard follows her into the cell. 
FELICITY (irritated) It's very hot in here, don't you think? 
The guard advances on her. 
FELICITY (breaking cover) Austin! 
AUSTIN (from above) I'm very firmly wedged. 
FELICITY If you want something done... 
She PUNCHES the guard right in the face and he collapses. 
AUSTIN Almost... got it! 
Austin falls flat on his face with a THUMP and pops back up. 
AUSTIN Let's go get my mojo! 
INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE 
It is a stark, steel girder and glass structure. Dr. Evil is trying to look dignified but he is FLOATING AWAY. He grabs at the railing of his chair as his feet float up. 
Austin is grossed out. 
FELICITY Are you happy? 
FAT BASTARD What kind of stupid ass question is that? I'm (bleep)in' rich and I'm up to my tits in clean stinky. 
FELICITY You didn't answer my question, are you happy? 
FAT BASTARD It's about my girth isn't it? Sure I could lose a few pounds, but I could shiva git! 
FELICITY Are you happy? 
FAT BASTARD Of course I'm not happy. Look at me, I'm a big fat slob. I've got bigger titties than you do! I've got more (bleep)in' chins than a Chinese phone book.  I've got more crack cheese than a (bleep)in' dairy. I've nay seen ma willie in two years. That's enough time to declare it legally deed! I can't stop eating. I eat because I'm unhappy and I'm unhappy because I eat. (starts to cry) I'm caught in a cycle and there's no escape! 
AUSTIN Maybe inside that Fat Bastard there's a thin bastard, trying to get out 
FAT BASTARD Maybe there's big crap inside me trying to get out, jack-ass!  Enough of your (bleep)in' new age aphorisms. Listen, I've run the gamut of self- help books.  "Food isn't love", right, but how do you get it from the page to the (bleep)in' fork?  I'm so weak, I hate myself. I'm for shite. Here, take the mojo. 
Fat Bastard hands over the mojo. 
FAT BASTARD I appreciate you trying to reach me, no one can do it for me, I know this now.  There's a hole in my soul that food won't fill. This is the beginning of a new me. I'm gonna go to the gym everyday. If you'll excuse me, there's someone I have to get in touch with and forgive... myself. (pause) Sorry. I farted. (pause) It's a long road ahead. 
EXT. BEACH - DR. EVIL'S ISLAND - DAY 
Austin and Felicity run up to the Beetle. 
AUSTIN Hold on, I have something very important to do. 
Austin drinks the mojo. 
FELICITY How do you feel? 
AUSTIN Sound as a pound, my spuds are boiling. Fancy a shag? 
FELICITY Austin, we don't have time. 
AUSTIN C'mon, luv, let's hop on the good foot and do the bad thing! 
FELICITY Dr. Evil's taken his laser to the moon. The world is in danger. 
AUSTIN Right, the moon. I think I know someone who can give us a lift. 
EXT. CAPE CANAVERAL - APOLLO ROCKET (STOCK FOOTAGE) 
The Apollo ready for lift-off. 
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) There's been some sort of delay in the launch of Apollo 11, Walter, but we understand that America's first manned mission to the moon will be blasting off shortly. 
INT. CAPSULE 
Pan across Austin in a spacesuit, then Felicity in her spacesuit, then CAMEO ASTRONAUT in his space suit. They are surrounded by hundreds of gauges, buttons and meters. 
AUSTIN Gor blimey, you'd have to be a rocket scientist to figure this stuff out. 
ASTRONAUT I am a rocket scientist. 
A technician closes the hatch and the countdown begins. 
MISSION COMMANDER (V.O.) We will have lift-off in T minus 10 seconds... 9... 8... etc. 
AUSTIN Felicity, if you get frightened, just hold my hand. 
EXT. CAPE CANAVERAL (STOCK FOOTAGE) 
The rocket lifts off. 
MISSION COMMANDER (V.O.) We have lift-off! Apollo 11 has cleared the tower and is heading for a rendezvous with the moon. 
INT. APOLLO CAPSULE 
THE SCREEN FLICKERS ON: 
DR. EVIL Mr. President, your time is up. This is your last chance to pay 100 billion dollars or see Washington DC destroyed. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) WARNING, LASER CALIBRATION! 
The ALARM continues to blare. 
INT. OVAL OFFICE (SPLIT SCREEN) 
The President at his desk. 
PRESIDENT What? I can't hear you. 
DR. EVIL Pay me 100 billion dollars or see Washington DC destroyed! 
The ALARM BLARES. 
PRESIDENT I'm sorry, I just can't hear you. 
DR. EVIL (louder) How about now? 
PRESIDENT Better. 
DR. EVIL The Capital will be destroyed- 
The ALARM BLARES. 
PRESIDENT Sorry! I just can't- I think it's that alarm. 
DR. EVIL Could someone shut off that frickin' alarm? I'm trying to hold the free world hostage here. Honestly. (shouting) WILL DESTROY WASHINGTON DC UNLESS YOU PAY ME- 
The ALARM SHUTS OFF but Dr. Evil is still shouting. 
DR. EVIL (shouting) 100 BILLION DOLLARS! 
His yelling startles even himself. 
PRESIDENT Please Dr. Evil, be reasonable. That's more money than is in the entire Federal Treasury! 
DR. EVIL Oh well, I guess you have one minute to- "show me the money"! 
PRESIDENT I still don't know what that means. I can't show you the money because we don't have the money. 
DR. EVIL Then I suppose you're up shit's crick without a paddle. 
INT. NASA CONTROL ROOM 
A white room with a bank of old-fashioned computers and a tracking screen. Basil, several GENERALS, and other VIPs look anxiously over the shoulder of the MISSION CONTROL SPECIALISTS. 
BASIL EXPOSITION Gentlemen, Austin has landed on the moon. We'll soon know whether he has succeeded or whether the world will be destroyed! 
INT. DR. EVIL'S MOON BASE - HALLWAY 
Austin and Felicity enter through a hatch and step out of their spacesuits. 
FELICITY Let's find Dr. Evil. 
Suddenly, Austin notices something. 
AUSTIN Shhh... 
He points. We see a profile through a sheet of frosted glass. It is Dr. Evil's distinctive profile, with a machine gun. Austin takes careful aim and FIRES.  We see the SHADOW take the hit, and fall. 
FELICITY Austin, you've done it! You got Dr. Evil! 
AUSTIN Of course I did, baby, I got my mojo working overtime. 
FELICITY Austin, I'm going ahead. Cover my rear! 
It is too late. Dr. Evil runs through the TIME PORTAL and gets away. 
AUSTIN Felicity, you have to understand, I thought I had my mojo back.  This isn't fair. 
Austin looks up to the heavens. We see a quick-- 
FLASHBACK - MONTAGE 
of moments they shared, Austin making her laugh, their first kiss, of Felicity being her beautiful and free-spirited self. 
A tear runs down his cheek. Austin presses his face against the glass as if trying to reach her. 
AUSTIN I love you, Felicity! I know I couldn't say it before, but I really do love you! (enraged) Dr. Evil, I'll kill him! 
Austin starts to chase him, but THREE PRIVATE ARMY MEN block his path. Austin is like an animal. 
He charges toward the first soldier, RIPS HIS HEART OUT, and takes a bite out of it. 
Then Austin turns to the second soldier and RIPS HIS SPINE OUT like in Mortal Kombat. The soldier slumps to the ground. 
The last soldier is terrified. Austin swings both fists simultaneously, crushing the guy's head which EXPLODES LIKE A PUMPKIN. 
Austin runs over to the TIME PORTAL set for "75 BC". He runs through. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROMAN VILLA - 75 BC 
An orgy is taking place. Dr. Evil is in a toga with a laurel with two YOUNG ROMAN MEN feeding him grapes. 
DR. EVIL You make love to your wife out of duty, your mistress for pleasure, and a Roman boy for ecstasy. (noticing Austin) Shit. 
He runs away as Austin appears through the TIME PORTAL. Austin follows Dr. Evil into another TIME PORTAL marked "1975". 
EXT. VENTURA BOULEVARD - 
Austin emerges from the TIME PORTAL to see Dr. Evil getting into a car. Austin waves his hands and a 1974 RED FORD TORINO with a white stripe pulls over. 
AUSTIN I have to commandeer this vehicle. (noticing) Hey, aren't you Hutch? 
VOICE (O.S.) No. 
We see PAUL MICHAEL GLASER (STARSKY). 
PAUL MICHAEL GLASER I'm Starsky. 
DAVID SOUL I'm Hutch. 
Austin jumps in and the Torino speeds off. Dr. Evil's car disappears into a car wash which is a TIME PORTAL. The Torino follows. 
A sign at the car wash reads: "1911" 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DECK OF THE TITANIC - 
Passengers in period garb walk past a lifesaver with "Titanic" stenciled above it. Dr. Evil enters through a portal with Austin hot on his heels. 
CAPTAIN (O.S.) Iceberg, dead ahead! 
Suddenly the ship tilts at a radical angle. LEONARDO DICAPRIO, KATE WINSLET, and JAMES CAMERON slide by. 
JAMES CAMERON I'm king of the world! 
Dr. Evil and Austin slide backwards into the TIME PORTAL they just came from. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY -

a film by barbet schroeder 
BATHROOM - INTERIOR 
We don't know if it's day or night. We see a little girl, aged around eight, putting lipstick on her lips. She is wearing earrings and a ring on the middle finger of her right hand. She moves forward and we see another girl about the same age. The first girl puts lipstick on the lips of the second girl. Both girl are smiling. 
More credits, still without capital letters. 
The camera moves back and we get a better view of the second girl. The two girls appear to be twins. The first girl takes a powder puff and puts powder on the second girl's cheeks. 
The two girls look at themselves in the mirror. The camera gives the impression to be located behind the mirror. 
The first girl gives a kiss on the cheek of the second girl. 
FADE OUT TO BLACK SCREEN 
The title of the film appears on the black screen. 
The camera moves and we see, appearing on the right-hand side of the screen : 
BUILDING - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
This building is actually Allison's building, but we don't know it yet. 
Credits resume on the screen. 
The camera keeps on moving and we see several lit windows. The building itself is a nice building with carvings on the walls. 
The camera moves backward, giving us a full view of the building. 
As the camera comes back forward, we hear two voices speaking, one male, one female. They are the voices of Allison «Allie» Jones and her fiancé Sam Rawson. 
SAM (voice over) So how many kids do we want ? 
ALLISON (voice over) I dunno. What's the statistical norm ? 
SAM (voice over) You and your statistics. 
Allison laughs 
SAM (voice over) One point two. 
ALLISON (voice over) Okay, then I want two point two. 
Fade to : 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Sam and Allison are lying on the bed, partly dressed. Sam is holding Allison next to him. They are both about thirty years old. Allison has short red hair, and Sam has brown wavy hair. 
Behind the front of the bed we see the wrought iron of the balcony. The light is very dim in the room, lit only by the street lights and a couple of candles. We hear Allison finishing her last voice over sentence. 
ALLISON And I want them to look like you. 
SAM Poor kids. 
End of credits. 
SAM So, if I got to be able to drag you away from computer tomorrow, I'll buy you that ring. 
ALLISON Sure. So, is this gonna be a real wedding ? 
She moves a bit away from him, and takes a piece of grapes in a plate lying on the floor. SAM As opposed to a fake one ? 
ALLISON You know what I mean, Sam. You've already been through the big ceremony with too hundred people. 
SAM That was the fake one. This is the real one. You can have any kind of wedding you want. Underwater. In and out of a steam room in the wild. Horseback. 
Allison goes back into Sam's arms. 
The camera moves up from the desk, on which the newspaper is lying, to Allison's face, who is speaking over the telephone. Around her, we see other desks with people working. 
ALLISON Oh, yes, that's a promise. Rent-stabilized, so you couldn't come on the lease. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY 
A young butch woman, wearing a leather jacket and a black and white bandana around her head, bangs her fist on the walls of the kitchen. She enters the kitchen, where Allison is sitting at a table. Behind Allison, a nice white stove. The butch girl is carrying a motorcycle helmet in her left hand. In the credits, the butch girl is called «Mannish Applicant» 
THE BUTCH GIRL Nice... you could really open 'em up. I can't wait to get in here. Are you proper with tools ? ALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
A young very pretty woman, dressed in a short brown dress, moves around the room and then looks at Allison with a seducing eye. Allison, who is holding some papers in her hand, looks at the departing applicant with an amused eye. 
Later in the same room. Another applicant is walking around the room. She's wearing large glasses, and never stops talking. While she is walking, we hear a camera clicking and we see a camera flashlight across the room. 
TALKATIVE APPLICANT I'm an incest survivor, you know. I haven't remembered the instance yet, but I know it's there somewhere. I just have the sense that I survived something. All my therapists think so. 
She goes out the room in the hall. Allison is shaking her head behind her back. TALKATIVE APPLICANT Oh God, a kitchen ! I hate kitchens, cooking, cleaning, anything feminine. I mean, it's probably my mother's fault. 
While the applicant is going into another room, Allison is writing something on a pad she is holding in her left hand. Underneath the pad is a Polaroid camera, certainly the one we saw the flashlight coming from. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
A nice clear room, with a comfortable vintage-looking couch. 
A young woman is standing in the middle of the room, wearing a white blouse and brown large pants, looking very discreet... too perfect ! 
PERFECT APPLICANT I think this could work. And if you feel the same, please give me a call. 
Allison takes her picture with her Polaroid camera. 
Later. Close-up on the pile of application forms. On the top of the pile, the one concerning the woman we just saw, with her picture stapled in the left top corner of the form. 
Allison is sitting on the couch, looking through the files. She has the file of the last woman in her hand. She stands up and walks to the kitchen. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison picks up the phone and dials the number of the last applicant, whose form is still in her hand. Then she sees Sam's picture on the fridge door. She puts the form on the top of the fridge. Close-up of Sam's picture. 
Allison takes the picture off the fridge door and starts dialing again. 
SAM'S VOICE ON THE PHONE Hello, Sam Rawson. Hello ? 
Allison puts the phone back on its hook on the wall. She sits down on the floor crying, and still holding Sam's picture. She crumples the picture into a small tight ball. 
We see a pair of foot underneath a long light-grey dress walking in the hall. Allison is still crying. 
The woman knocks on the kitchen wall. Allison stands up with a start. 
ALLISON Oh !... Hi ! 
We get a full view of the unknown visitor. It's Hedra Carlson. She is wearing a black hat on her long light brown hair. She is carrying a large bag held by a strap across her chest. She looks very sweet and nice. 
HEDRA Hi !... The front door was kind of open. Are you Allison Jones ? 
ALLISON Yes... I'm Allie. 
HEDRA Oh, I'm Hedra Carlson. We spoke on the phone this morning. 
She looks at Allison's face, where we still can see she's been crying. 
HEDRA Are you sure you're okay ? 
ALLISON You know what ? I'm not. Would it be all right if you came back tomorrow ? 
Hedra starts taking her arm, and then moves away inside the kitchen. 
HEDRA Why don't you just... sit down. 
ALLISON No, I'm fine. 
HEDRA I'll make you some tea. 
ALLISON I just... I don't think I had lunch, that's all. Hedra tries to get some water at the sink, but just gets a strange noise. 
ALLISON It's only this one. The one in the bathroom works. Here... 
She comes to the sink, and takes a wrench lying by the sink. 
ALLISON I use a wrench. 
She squeezes the water faucet with the wrench. Hedra puts her bag on the floor. Allison keeps on trying to open the faucet with her wrench, but the faucet breaks off and showers both girls. 
Hedra bends down to shut the main water tap under the sink. 
The girls are both all wet. 
ALLISON Oh ! Wow !... Wow !... I'm so sorry. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Close-up on Hedra's dress and Allison's jacket drying on hangers near the open window. 
HEDRA (voice over) If you need a reference, you can call them at Rizzoli. 
Hedra gives some papers to Allison, seated on the sofa. Hedra is wearing a red T-shirt and black pants, certainly borrowed from Allison. 
ALLISON Excuse me. 
When the inner door is completely shut, the outer door slides automatically into shut position. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY 
The elevator is moving up. 
THE TENANT Which floor ? 
ALLISON Eleven 
The tenant presses a button on the switchboard by the door. 
HEDRA Fourteen, please. 
The tenant presses another button. Hedra plays with her keys and smiles to Allison. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison and Hedra move a table out of the room. The table is covered with various objets, and has apparently been used as a desk. When they try to squeeze the table through the door, they upset everything that is on the table down on the floor. They scream and laugh. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison turns the water faucet on, and it seems to be working perfectly. ALLISON Okay. 
Hedra is kneeling by the sink, looking at the cupboard underneath the sink. She stands up with an oval metal dish. 
HEDRA Look what I found. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - SPARE BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra is kneeling on the floor, cleaning the dish she has found in the kitchen. It shines so well that she can look at herself in it as if it was a mirror. 
Close up on the dish. Beside Hedra's face, we see Allison's face coming to join her. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra, just wearing her underwear, is talking on the phone. HEDRA I'm not sure. Hold on, I'll check. 
Sitting on the floor, Allison is painting the old lamp Hedra has found in the basement. An electric fan is working next to her. Hedra puts the dress she is holding on the receiver, and whispers. 
HEDRA Allie, it's Sam. 
Allison shakes her head «No». 
NEW YORK - A STREET - EXTERIOR DAY 
Nice weather. Busy street, with shops and people. Allison and Hedra are walking, eating ice cream cones. Allison is very elegantly dressed. Hedra is more simply dressed and is still wearing her old black hat. 
HEDRA Where do you guys learn to dress like that ? I mean, it's just so New York. 
ALLISON I think you look very comfortable. 
HEDRA Yeah, I never know what looks good. 
NEW YORK - A CLOTHES SHOP - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra comes out of a dressing room, wearing a very elegant red jacket. 
ALLISON Oh !... I think that looks nice HEDRA Yes ? 
ALLISON But I found this. 
She gives her a red dress on a hanger, which she was holding out of our view. 
HEDRA Oh ! 
ALLISON I think you'd look great with that. 
HEDRA Okay 
Hedra takes the dress and looks at it. 
NEW YORK - A SHOE SHOP - INTERIOR DAY We see only Allison's feet and legs. She is sitting on a chair trying on some high-heel shoes. We see Hedra's feet coming toward her. She is also wearing high-heel shoes. 
HEDRA Hey ! What do you think ? 
ALLISON I think you should take them. 
Allison takes off the shoes she was trying on. 
HEDRA Oh God, you like them ? 
We now see both girls' faces. Hedra is taking off the shoes she was wearing. 
ALLISON Well, I think they go great with that dress. 
HEDRA You take them 
She gives her shoes to Allison. 
ALLISON Well... 
ALLISON (voice over from the corridor) I'm not ready to see you. You're just going on something that's over. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Allison is still on the phone. 
ALLISON No, there's nothing to talk about anyway. Sam, there's somebody here right now... 
We see Hedra's face peeking through the door of her bedroom. 
ALLISON All right ?... Okay... Bye. 
She puts the phone down. Hedra is still peeking behind her bedroom door. 
HEDRA Why don't we order some Chinese ? 
Allison remains two seconds motionless with her hand on the telephone, and then smiles and shakes her head «Yes». ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Through the open door of the bathroom, we see Hedra kneeling by the bathtub, and apparently washing something in the bathtub. 
The phone rings. Hedra rushes out of the bathroom. She is wearing a orange T-shirt, a very large red boxer-short and white slippers. 
ANSWERING MACHINE Hi, this is Allison Jones. Please leave a message. Thank you. 
A beep. 
While listening to the machine, Hedra picks up a box on the telephone table, takes a sweet out of the box, eats it, and puts the box back on the table 
SAM'S VOICE ON   THE ANSWERING MACHINE Allie, are you   there ?... Allie, pick up. Allie, listen. Please, please   call me back. This is torture for me. I know you need me as   much as I need you. I love you. I'll do anything for you for us to get back together, just call me. 
A click, meaning the end of the call. Hedra presses a button on the answering machine, to erase Sam's message. 
We hear some yapping coming from the bathroom. Hedra turns her head toward the bathroom. 
HEDRA Buddy ! 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Close-up shot of Hedra, kneeling by the bathtub and holding a big puppy in her arms. She is rinsing it with mugs of water taken from the bath. 
HEDRA Oh, yes, you're a good clean boy. You're going to cheer her up, are you ? Hmm ? You're going to cheer her up. So she'll let you stay. 
While rinsing the puppy, she hugs and kisses it. 
She hears the front door opening and turns her head around. She says «Shhh !» to the puppy, and whispers some other incomprehensible words to it, then puts it back in the bathtub. 
Close-up of a paper lying near the sink over Hedra's key-ring. The paper is a bill from a shop called «Pet Express», in New-York. It was paid in cash, and the date is 8/16. It reads : 
YELLOW LAB PUPPY MALE, 6 WEEKS OLD, $ 350,- TAX $ 29,75 
Hedra's hand crumples the bill and puts it in the waste-basket underneath the other items already in the basket. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison enters the apartment. She is wearing a silver-colored raincoat. 
ALLISON Yoo-hoo ! 
She closes the front door. Through the open bathroom door, we see Hedra going from the waste-basket to the bathtub. She takes a towel and wraps it around the puppy, still in the tub. 
Allison puts her keys on the shelf by the door, puts her handbag on the floor, and presses a button on the answering machine. A beep and then : 
ANSWERING MACHINE No messages. 
Behind Allison, we see Hedra coming out the bathroom carrying the puppy wrapped in the towel. 
Allison turns around, sees Hedra with the puppy and stops in her tracks. She doesn't seem very happy, almost angry in fact. 
HEDRA I know I shouldn't have, but they were just giving him away... in the market. But they said I could bring him back to-morrow. 
ALLISON Well, I hope they meant it. 
Hedra sits down on the floor. 
HEDRA Well... his name's Buddy. I had a dog named Buddy when I was little. 
She gives a kiss to the puppy. She then looks up at Allison's face, which doesn't seem very friendly. 
HEDRA Tomorrow, okay. I promise. 
Allison walks away taking off her raincoat. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
We hear the puppy yapping. Hedra is sitting on her bed in the dark. She stands up and peeks through the ajar opening of the door. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close-up at Hedra's peeking through the ajar opening of the door. The puppy is still yapping. The door of Allison's bedroom opens and Allison comes out. She is wearing a light pink nightdress. 
She slowly opens the kitchen door, bends down and picks up the puppy. 
ALLISON Oh ! Come on. 
The outer door opens. Allison bends down to pick up her shopping bags. She opens the inner door and takes the keys Graham is giving her. 
ALLISON Friday ? 
GRAHAM That'll be great. I'll make dinner when I get back. 
Allison closes the inner door. ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
Reverse angle shot of Allison closing the elevator inner door. The outer door closes automatically. Allison walks along the hall toward her apartment. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
The front door opens. Allison bends down to pick up her shopping bags and enters the apartment. The front door closes behind her. She drops her keys on the little shelf by the door. She sees Hedra in the doorway of the living room. Her hair is in a bun. 
ALLISON Hey, I thought you'd be at work. 
HEDRA No. 
ALLISON Don't tell me we have the same belt. Hedra looks down at her belt. She seems embarrassed by something. 
HEDRA Well... Yeah ... Sorry... Listen, I have to talk to you. 
ALLISON You have to see these. Look, cookies for dogs. 
HEDRA Oh, they're great. 
ALLISON I had to get them. They're so great. 
HEDRA Can I just talk to you for a second... 
ALLISON Buddy ! 
Sam enters from the living room with the puppy in his arms. 
HEDRA I tried to let you know. 
Sam puts the puppy on the floor. 
ALLISON What are you doing here ? Hedy ! 
SAM But no, don't blame Hedy. It's not her fault, okay. 
Hedra goes out of the hall into the living room. 
SAM I kind of forced my way in here. I had to see you. Hedra comes back in the hall. 
HEDRA I've got to get out of here now. Unless you need me... 
She looks back and forth to Allison and Sam, and gets just a «No» head-shake as an answer from Allison. 
HEDRA Okay. 
Hedra goes out of the apartment and closes the door behind her. 
ALLISON Why can't you just leave me alone ? 
Allison takes her shopping bags and goes into the kitchen. 
SAM You've got to talk to me, baby. You just can't pretend I don't exist. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison puts her bags down on a table. 
ALLISON Easier that way, Okay ? Is that so hard to try to make it easier on me ? 
SAM But people screw up. People do something wrong. And I was wrong, I admit it. And you just... You cut me off. You don't take my calls. You don't answer my letters. 
ALLISON Wait a minute. You lied to me ! If she hadn't called, would I have found out ? I think that's really scary, okay ? Please, if you want to be nice, just stay away. 
SAM Okay. You know, I know that there is something that you just can put back together. I was hoping that this wasn't one of them. 
ALLISON Well, I guess it is. And... I didn't get any letter. So, I wasn't trying to punish you by not answering it. I just didn't get it. 
SAM Well, I sent it with the keys. 
ALLISON Well, I didn't get those, either. What did it say ? 
SAM Forget the letter. I love you. I can't exist without you. I have no excuse for what I did, Allie. You have to give me a second chance. 
She goes into his arms. He hugs her. She start crying. 
ALLISON You really hurt me, Sam. 
SAM Shhh ! 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - EXTERIOR DAY 
Close-up on Allison's kitchen window. We see Allison and Sam hugging each other. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra is standing by the window, with a knee on the heater. She seems very pensive. 
An old lady comes out of the elevator, and looks at Hedra. Hedra turns her head toward the lady. She picks up her bag, which was sitting on the heater beside her, and moves away from the window. She goes to the elevator and presses the call button. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Without switching the lights on, Allison puts her mail on a chest of drawers. 
HEDRA Where the hell have you been ? Allison gasps at that somber voice in the dark. Hedra switches the bed-light on. She is sitting on Allison's bed, with her legs covered by the sheet, and the puppy on her laps. She is wearing her night-dress, with a pink sweater on her shoulders. 
ALLISON God, Hedy, what are you doing in my room ? 
HEDRA I've been waiting since six o'clock last night to hear from you. I'm worried sick. Buddy was crying. I thought I might as well come in here, so it calm down. 
ALLISON Sorry, I guess I just didn't think. 
HEDRA No, you didn't. There's such a thing as a phone, you know. This is New York. Things happen. 
ALLISON Okay, okay, I'm sorry. It was thoughtless, really. You're making me feel like I'm sixteen years old here. 
She goes to the bed where Hedra is stroking absently the puppy. She kneels down at the bedside. 
ALLISON Hey, are you okay ? 
HEDRA Yeah... Yeah. Just... forget it. So, I guess you've patched things up with Sam, huh ? 
ALLISON Yeah... Yeah, I made him suffer. 
Hedra looks down at Allison hand stroking the puppy. 
HEDRA Is that an engagement ring ? 
Allison stands up. 
ALLISON Right. 
Hedra sighs, and moves the sheet away to get out of the bed. 
HEDRA Beautiful ring. 
ALLISON Thanks. 
Hedra walks away from the bed. She gives a last look at Allison's ring. 
HEDRA Really great. She walks to the door. 
HEDRA I'm sure you'll be very happy ... you'll be very happy and I'll be alone. 
ALLISON No, no, wait a little. You'll find someone, Hedy. I mean, God, if I can... 
Hedra is standing in the doorway and points to the mirror. 
HEDRA Why don't you look in the mirror ?... Huh ? Look ! 
She comes back into the bedroom. She forces Allison to look at both of them in the mirror. 
HEDRA Look ! You're in a different league. I know that. You have this great personality. You have this great style. You're running your own business. You're always going to find someone. You'd have to be stupid to think that you wouldn't. 
She puts her head in her hand. 
HEDRA Well, I guess you... you and Sam want to be together. So... I have to move out, right ?... No ? 
ALLISON Well, anyway, Sam's going to keep his place for a while. I know you just spent a lot on furniture. 
HEDRA Yeah, your timing is great, Allie, it's really great ! You promised me this wouldn't happen. Exactly what... 
ALLISON Nothing's happened, Hedy, come on. Look, I'll talk to Sam. Well... Well, maybe we'll move, I don't know. Maybe, we'll find some place like this, or... I don't know. But, we'll see, we'll figure something out. Okay ? 
FONTANA FASHIONS OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Fontana Fashions is Mitchell Myerson's company. 
Close-up on some feminine hands typing on an Apple computer keyboard. We see various windows, showing models of female dress, opening and closing on the screen. 
MITCHELL (voice over) They tell me they're nervous. 
ALLISON (voice over) Of course, they're nervous. They're salesmen. They want to be sold. We see the whole room. It is a very big room with large white columns supporting the ceiling, and large bay windows. 
Girls are working in the background. Some are trying a new dress on a model girl. Mitchell's assistant is typing on the computer, with Allison standing near her. Her name is Barbara, and she is a woman with brown hair and a sleek bob haircut. Mitchell is standing a couple of feet away. 
ALLISON Let's set up a demo, to show them something. Something special, something different, you know. Maybe at night, you know. Open bar, open minds. That's «F» night. 
Mitchell walks to the desk next to Barbara's one, where he starts flipping the cards of a Rolodex. 
MITCHELL I'll set it up, I'll set it up. Maybe I... I'll call you tonight after I check on some things. ALLISON Great. 
He takes a card from the Rolodex. 
MITCHELL «8796, Knox». Knox ? What's this Knox ? 
ALLISON Oh no, that's Graham Knox. He is my upstair neighbor. That was just for last night. Oh, he's the first one. 
MITCHELL Well, I've got to admit, I'm very impressed. 
ALLISON Well, maybe you start spreading the word. 
MITCHELL You know, I can see I'm not going to be able to afford you any more. 
Reverse angle shot showing what the woman sees from her balcony. Buddy, the puppy dog, is lying motionless on the pavement, with a group of passers-by around it. One of them points his finger to the upper stories of the building. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE ALLISON'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison and Sam are running toward Allison's apartment door. Allison opens it. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison rushes into the apartment, followed by Sam. 
ALLISON (yelling) Hedy ! 
She runs past the kitchen door. We see Hedra sitting at the kitchen table. She stands up when she sees Allison. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison stops in front of the window. The window is open and the broken piece of wrought iron, on which Sam was working earlier in the morning, is missing, leaving a gap in the balustrade, a gap wide enough for a puppy dog to go through. 
ALLISON (screaming and crying) He's dead ! Buddy's dead ! 
Sam climbs on the balcony. 
Close up on the gap in the balustrade. 
HEDRA What ? 
Hedra seems genuinely surprised. She still has the earphones of her Walkman around her neck. 
ALLISON (crying) You left the window open. How could you do that ? 
HEDRA But I thought we could leave it open. I know you fixed it this morning. 
Sam is still on the balcony, looking at the balustrade. 
SAM I thought I did. 
HEDRA It's me. I interrupted you when I called you in for breakfast. And Allie, it's my fault. 
She starts crying. Allison rushes out the room. 
HEDRA Allie ! 
SAM (voice over) Allie ! 
Sam runs out of the room after Allison. 
SAM Allie ! 
Hedra walks to the balcony and slowly slides the window down. 
Fade out. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Allison is lying in her bed with the sheet up to her neck. Sam bends over her and gives her a light tender kiss on the lips. Then he stands up. We hear him leaving the room and closing the door. Allison turns her head with her eyes still closes. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Hedra is sitting on the floor in the dark, leaning on the wall. She is sorting things and putting them in a box in front of her. Hearing the musical noise of a plastic toy, we understand she is putting the puppy's stuff away. 
Sam comes out of Allison's room and, walking in the hall in front of the kitchen open door, stops and looks at her. 
SAM Thanks, that pill helped. 
HEDRA Are you still going on that trip tomorrow ? 
SAM Well, she wants me to. 
HEDRA If I'd just let you finish your work this morning... 
We can hear repressed tears in her voice. Then she starts crying for real. 
SAM Listen, if she blames anybody, she blames me, huh ? 
Sam kneels down. 
SAM Shh ! 
Sam takes her in his arms where she goes on crying. He slowly stands up, still holding her in his arms. He leads her to her room. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Outside Hedra's room. Sam is in the doorway. Hedra moves slightly away from him and then hugs him even stronger. 
Gently, he pushes her away from him. They almost kiss on the mouth, but Sam takes her arms off his neck and goes out of her room, where she stays. He closes the door behind him, and she holds his hand on the doorknob. Then she moves her hand away and the door closes. We hear her sobbing behind the closed door. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison is asleep on her bed, dressed with a short black slip and black panty hoses. 
The phone rings. Allison wakes up slowly, and, with her eyes still closed, feels around on the night table to find the phone. She eventually picks it up. ALLISON Hello ?... Hi, Mitch... 
She raises her head. 
ALLISON What ? 
MITCHELL Ho-ho. According to this, we should have paid you last Friday. 
ALLISON That's all right. Barbara will handle that. 
MITCHELL Not till I give her the word. 
Allison turns to him, and seems not to like his strange smile. 
ALLISON Well, I hope you're satisfied with what I've done. 
MITCHELL So far. 
He walks away from her and goes to the Champagne table. 
ALLISON But this is it. I mean, there ain't much more. Just maybe a little fine tuning, that's it. I have some free time now, if you want us to set up some meeting with your colleagues. 
Using a napkin, he is drying a bottle of Champagne he just got out of its bucket. 
MITCHELL I was thinking that maybe I want to keep you all to myself. 
He throws the napkin on the floor, and comes back toward Allison with the bottle of Champagne. He puts the bottom of the bottle on Allison's bare shoulders. She shivers. 
MITCHELL Top her ? 
ALLISON What are you doing ? 
He puts his other hand on her shoulder. Then he puts the bottle on the table, and starts massaging her shoulders. 
MITCHELL That's just that you're so tight. ALLISON Mitch, please, don't. That's enough. 
He grabs her from behind and squeezes her in his arms. 
ALLISON Mitch... 
MITCHELL Hey, look... 
He kisses her neck. 
MITCHELL I've been a good boy, haven't I ? And you've been a good girl. We have nothing to prove any more. 
He keeps on kissing her neck, and puts his hand inside her dress to reach her breast. Allison seems to be on the verge of tears. 
MITCHELL This is your last chance to play before you're an old married lady. 
ALLISON Let me turn around, okay ? 
She has a strange smile on her lips. 
MITCHELL That's better. That's better. 
He stands up. 
MITCHELL Just a second... A second... 
While she slowly turns around on her swivel seat, he starts unzipping his pants, and lets them fall on his ankles, showing his white trunks. 
Allison, still   seated, is now facing him, her face at the level of his crotch. He   takes her head to guide it toward his private parts. Allison   looks up at him and then, with both fists and all her might, she   hits him very hard between his legs. He screams. 
She jumps from her seat and runs out of the room. 
He falls on the floor, holding his private parts with both hands. 
MITCHELL Fucking bitch ! 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close-up on Allison, still in her black dress, and holding a glass of wine. 
HEDRA (voice over) Here. Take this. 
We see Hedra's hand giving some pills to Allison. She then replaces the glass of wine by a glass of water. 
ALLISON I can't believe I didn't see it coming. It's just so humiliating. 
HEDRA (voice over) You're too nice, that's the problem. Men are pigs. I don't care how nice they seem. You always fall for that. 
ALLISON But what I did... It was like something inside taking over. It was scary. 
We see Hedra standing near the mantlepiece. She is wearing an orange T-shirt and a red skirt. 
HEDRA No, Allie, don't turn this around. You're the victim. He should pay for this. 
She kneels on the floor in front of Allison. 
ALLISON He'll pay. I set up all my programs, so they have to eventually. 
Hedra laughs. 
HEDRA What ! I'm not talking about getting paid, I'm talking about getting even. 
ALLISON You don't understand. It's the contacts more than the money. When I just took the job for the word of mouth and now that's gone. It's just like he's put me back to square one. 
HEDRA Only if you let him. But you won't let him, will you ? 
HEDRA Yes. 
JIM Yes. 
Allison is staring at the couple 
HEDRA (voice over) Yeah, you look like my sister's boyfriend. 
Jim laughs. 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT 
We hear the first sentence said by Graham in voice over the previous sequence. 
GRAHAM Jesus, Allie, what is it ? 
Graham is opening his front door to Allie, who enters the apartment, but stays near the open front door. 
ALLISON God, you've got to help me, Graham. You've got to tell me what to do. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Hedra opens the front door and enters the apartment. 
HEDRA Allie ? 
She closes the door and locks it. 
HEDRA I'm home. 
She drops her keys on the shelf near the door and crosses the hall. 
The camera moves into the living room. ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Through the open door to the kitchen, we see Hedra crossing the kitchen to go into the living room. 
HEDRA Allie ? 
She seems slightly drunk and doesn't control her movements very well. Before entering the living room, she takes a blue bag in the kitchen (maybe something to eat) and drops it on a table. But, being a bit nervous, she actually drops the bag on a small bowl containing various objects, and the bowl falls on the floor and breaks into pieces. 
HEDRA Allie ? 
Hedra looks at the fallen bowl and bends down to pick up the debris. 
HEDRA God... 
The bowl has fallen near the air vent. It is exactly the same as the one which, earlier in the film, had enabled Graham to hear Sam and Allison's conversation. 
Hedra kneels down to gather the pieces of the broken bowl. We hear a faint voice. Hedra raises her head, trying to find out where this faint voice comes from. 
First, we don't understand the words the faint voice is saying, then it becomes clearer. It's Allison's voice speaking to Graham in his apartment. 
ALLISON (voice over from the air vent) It's like looking at myself. And she lies. I found a shoebox in her room. 
Hedra understands that the voice is coming from the air vent, and she moves closer to it. 
ALLISON (voice over from the air vent) Nothing she told me is true. The twin that she said died at birth. It was in an accident when she was nine. 
Hedra moves a brass knob on the air vent, to open it wider and to have a better understanding of the words. 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Graham and Allison are sitting on a couch. Graham has a glass in his hand, and Allison a cup. 
ALLISON And she stole a letter that Sam wrote me. I have to do something. Graham gets up from the couch. 
GRAHAM Get rid of her. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Hedra is still kneeling on the floor, with her ear close to the air vent, listening to the conversation between Allison and Graham. 
GRAHAM (voice over from the air vent) Call the police if you have to. If she steals thing you have to get her out of the place. 
We hear steps. Hedra looks up at the ceiling, and then slowly stands up. 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Graham is pouring something we don't see in a glass. 
ALLISON You're right. I'll tell her tonight. 
Allison gets up from the couch, with her cup in her hand. 
ALLISON I can't just throw her out on the street. I mean, she obviously needs help. 
GRAHAM She is a lunatic, Allie. She's got to go. Do it tonight. 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close-up on the front door. The door slowly opens and a hand covered by a black glove comes through the opening of the door. We hear the conversation going on between Graham and Allison. 
ALLISON (voice over) It's just that I feel responsible for her somehow. I'm the only one she has. Someone like her parent. 
We hear a little noise, and we see Allison turning her head. 
Close up on a mirror-covered door opening slowly. At that very moment, we, the spectators, do think we are still in Allison's apartment. But actually, we are in : 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT 
The door opens slowly with a light squeaking noise. We hear Graham's voice talking on the telephone in the next room. 
GRAHAM (voice over) This is serious, it's a lot more serious than I thought. No, I know you can't diagnose over the phone. 
The camera moves away from the door, then looks into the living- room, where Graham is sitting in the dark, only lit by the street lights coming through the window, and talking in the telephone. 
GRAHAM I don't know. I don't even know what hyper-vigilant is. No, I've never met the woman. She could be infantile or paranoid, whatever. I don't know... 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close-up on the air-vent. We see Allison's hands sticking pieces of large adhesive tape on the air-vent. We hear the faint voice of Graham still talking on the telephone, but we don't understand the words. 
Larger shot of Allison sitting on her bed and sticking the pieces of tape on the air-vent. 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Graham is still talking on the phone. 
GRAHAM I tell you what, let me go downstairs. If I call you from there, will you talk to my friend ? She can tell you better than I can. Right, okay. 
We hear some noise in the background, and Graham turns his head towards the noise. 
Quick reverse angle shot on the corridor seen from the living-room door. It looks empty and quiet. 
Back to Graham on the phone. GRAHAM Thanks. So... so, all right... so, so you might hear from us. Love to Jack. And you're not charging me for this. 
He puts the telephone down on his set on the table, turns his head again in the direction where he heard the strange noise, and gets up. He thinks it may be the cat and calls her with a soft gentle voice. 
GRAHAM Carmen... 
He gets out of the room into the corridor. 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - CORRIDOR - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Graham makes little noises with his lips to attract the cat. He suddenly hears the wooden floor squeak behind him. He turns his head. 
We see Hedra coming out of a room and walking towards the front door. Since we see only the back of her head, she can easily be mistaken for Allison. 
GRAHAM Allie ! 
She doesn't turn her head and just wave her hand. 
HEDRA Goodnight. 
She has almost reached the front door, when Graham realizes that something is queer about the girl's attitude. 
GRAHAM Hedy ? She turns around. She seems very panicky suddenly. She starts fumbling with the locks of the door, and drops the safety bar on the floor. 
HEDRA I'm sorry... 
GRAHAM Wait... hey, wait, it's okay. Take it easy. Take it... We just want to get you some help. 
Hedra is kneeling down, fumbling with the fallen safety bar. 
HEDRA No, Please... Please... I didn't do anything wrong. 
Graham is walking slowly towards her. 
GRAHAM Okay, take it easy. HEDRA I'm sorry, I didn't do anything. 
GRAHAM No problem. 
Hedra suddenly stands up with the safety bar held firmly in both hands. She strikes Graham first in the stomach, then, as he doubles up with pain, she strikes him again on the shoulder. Graham falls on the floor, and she gives him a final blow on the head, leaving him unconscious on the floor. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Allison is standing by the desk, talking on the telephone and holding the telephone set with her other hand. We hear a beep. 
ALLISON Hello, Mr. Besch, you don't know me, my name is Allison Jones. I think my room-mate Hedra is your daughter. Ellen. I'm not sure, really. She's... She's been under a lot of stress lately... And... Well... Huh... Huh... God... I really, really would not get into this on the answering machine. Could you please give me a call ? Or her ? I'm sure you have the phone number. It's 2-1-2-5-5-5-9-8-1-4. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
The front door opens, and Hedra comes in. 
ALLISON (voice over, still talking on the telephone) I'll really appreciate, I'll really. Don't say I called. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Allison, still on the phone, turns her head towards the front hall. ALLISON Oh, thank you. 
She puts the phone down. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Hedra closes the front door and walks slowly across the hall 
ALLISON (voice over) Hedy ? 
HEDRA (with a deep menacing voice) Don't call here again. 
HEDRA'S FATHER (voice over on the telephone) Ellen, listen. We'll stop sending the cheques if you don't come. I promise, no doctors this time. Just come. 
Hedra puts the telephone down. She doesn't move for a couple of seconds, then looks at Allison, trying to look more casual than she actually is. She has a little nervous laugh. HEDRA Obscene phone call. New York ! 
The phone rings again. Hedra picks up the receiver and slams it on the table. Then she presses on a button on the telephone set to cut off the communication. 
HEDRA Find someone else, jerk ! 
Allison walks to the telephone table. 
ALLISON I'm expecting a call from Sam. He might be coming in tonight. 
HEDRA Just for a little while, okay. Sam will call back if it's busy. 
Hedra hugs Allison. HEDRA I'm sorry, Allie. 
She moves away from Allison, looking falsely casual. 
HEDRA It's no big deal. I'll find some other place. You know, I just... I don't want you making a mistake. 
ALLISON I understand. Hey, we'll still be friends. We'll keep in touch. 
HEDRA Sure. 
Allison walks away to her room. 
Hedra picks up the telephone set from the little table, without putting the receiver back on its hook. We hear several short beeps coming from the telephone. With one nervous movement, Hedra tears the cord off the wall socket. Then she walks slowly into her room. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
A little later. Hedra is lying in her bed, writing something in a notebook. She is humming a song. Her other hand is resting on the telephone set on the bed. 
The phone rings. Hedra picks it up immediately, not to let it ring more than once. 
HEDRA (whispering) Hello ? 
SAM (voice over on the phone) Allie ? HEDRA No, it's Hedy. 
HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Sam is lying on the bed, still dressed in his suit and necktie. He is talking on the telephone. 
HEDRA (voice over on the phone) Where are you ? Where are you ? 
SAM Oh... I just got in from the airport. Is she asleep ? 
HEDRA (voice over on the phone) Yeah... 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Hedra gives a quick look at the clock on the night table. HEDRA It's after two. Do you want me to wake her ? 
SAM (voice over on the phone) No, tell her to surprise me. 
HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
HEDRA (voice over on the phone) Okay. 
SAM Okay. 
HEDRA (voice over on the phone) Okay, I'll tell her. 
SAM Goodnight, honey. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - HEDRA'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
HEDRA Goodnight, Sam. Sleep well. 
She slowly puts the phone down and plays a little with it. 
HOTEL ATHERTON - MAIN ENTRANCE - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
Close up on a pair of female legs and feet with stiletto heels shoes. 
The heels clicks on the sidewalk, and we see the figure of a woman walking away from us, and towards the entrance of the hotel. No one else is in the streets at this time of the night. The woman is wearing a grey raincoat. 
The woman enters the hotel. HOTEL ATHERTON - A BEDROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Sam is sleeping, covered by the sheet up to his waist, and apparently naked underneath. 
The door opens slowly. The woman in the grey raincoat enters the room. We have already guessed she is Hedra. 
She closes the door and puts the key on the night table. 
She remains motionless for a couple of seconds, looking at Sam, then she slowly starts to take the raincoat off. She is completely naked under the raincoat. 
She slides under the sheet of the bed, close to Sam. Sam moans in his sleep. He turns slowly towards Hedra, who starts kissing him on the chest. 
SAM (sleepy voice) Allie, Allie... what are you doing ? Hedra goes down Sam's body, still kissing him. When she gets between his legs, even if the room is very dark, we understand she is performing oral sex on him. 
Sam moans with pleasure. 
HEDRA I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, I know you want to save face. I won't tell her, okay ? Just... Just pick up the phone and call her and tell her you're going back to your ex-wife, or something. And I won't say a word, okay ? 
SAM Yeah... Well, you won't have to say a word, sweetheart, because I'm going to tell her myself. 
He walks to the night-table and picks up the telephone. She throws one of her shoes towards him. The shoe hits the wall just above his head. 
HEDRA (yelling) No ! 
He rushes towards her, ready to hit her. 
SAM Fucking bitch ! 
But, before he reaches her, she strikes him very hard in the face with her other shoe. The stiletto heel of the shoe enters his left eye, and, behind the eye, certainly enters his skull and his brain, because, instantly after the blow, Sam falls heavily on his back on the floor, where he remains motionless and unconscious. 
With her bare foot, Hedra touches his cheek. 
HEDRA (softly) Hey !... Hey ! 
HOTEL ATHERTON - LOBBY - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Close up on Hedra's feet walking on the rug. She's wearing both of her stiletto heels shoes. 
Hedra goes down some steps and reaches the hotel reception desk. The same hotel clerk, that we saw earlier in the film, when Sam and Allison came together into the hotel, is talking on the phone. He is talking in a soft voice, so we can't understand exactly what he's saying. 
But, when Hedra walks in front of his desk, he puts his hand on the receiver microphone, and says, in a louder voice : 
HOTEL CLERK Goodnight, Miss Jones. 
Without turning her head, Hedra waves her hand. 
HEDRA Goodnight. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY Close up on the clock on the night table : it says 06:22. 
Allison slowly wakes up to some noise in the apartment. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison comes out of her bedroom, wearing a long sleeveless pink night shirt. She seems to be naked underneath. 
She walks around the room, looking in every room which door is open. 
ALLISON Hedy ?... Hedy ? 
She eventually finds her in the living room, vigorously cleaning the mantlepiece. Hedra is wearing a long plain gray dress and red rubber gloves. Allison remains at the door of the room. 
ALLISON Hedy ? Hedra looks up at Allison, but doesn't stop her cleaning. 
HEDRA Oh, hi ! I hope I didn't wake you. I got an early start. 
ALLISON No, Hedy, I didn't mean for you to move out today. 
Hedra looks around the room. 
HEDRA Oh, there, I think that's it. 
She goes out of the room into the hall. 
HEDRA I hope you don't mind. I'm storing some of my stuff in the cage downstairs. 
She resumes her vigorous cleaning in the hall, starting with the small shelf by the front door. 
HEDRA That way, I won't have to bother... You see what I mean... You know... I mean... 
Allison has come near Hedra. 
ALLISON Sure, that's fine. Look, I'm really sorry it didn't work out. 
Hedra has stacked «her stuff» near the front door. She picks them up : a red suitcase, a cardboard box and a large paper bag. She has taken her rubber gloves off and keeps them in one hand. 
HEDRA Well, I'd better get this stuff out of here. Allison walks to the door. 
ALLISON I'll help. 
She opens the door. 
ALLISON We can have breakfast when you get back. 
Hedra walks out of the apartment. Allison closes the door, but remains behind it, lost in her thoughts. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra is rapidly walking along a corridor, carrying «her stuff». 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Close up on the open red suitcase. Inside, all the clothes that makes Hedra look like Allison. Hedra takes the clothes out of the suitcase and puts them into the open incinerator. Then she sprays some lighter fluid over the clothes. 
Close up on Hedra's hands striking a match on the side of a matchbox. She throws the match into the incinerator, and long flames immediately start on the clothes. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison is fixing breakfast. She has cut some fruits into small pieces and she puts them in the bowl of the blender. We hear some music from the TV in the background. 
HEDRA Okay ? 
Allison puts the glass down and shakes her head «Yes». Hedra strokes the back of her head. 
HEDRA Feeling better ? ALLISON Yeah. I can go out for a while. I feel much better now. 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison walks out of the bathroom, followed by Hedra. 
HEDRA I thought you said breakfast ? 
Allison has reached the front door, and she starts unlocking the door. 
ALLISON Oh, it's in the blender. I've got to go out. 
Hedra looks at Allison thin sleeveless night shirt and smiles. 
HEDRA Dressed like that? 
ALLISON I'm out. I'm just going to go upstairs and see Graham. He called while you were out. 
Hedra looks at Allison with a very strange expression on her face. She can see the tears on Allison's face. 
HEDRA Well, still, if you're not feeling well, you should wear more than that. 
ALLISON Maybe you're right. 
She walks away to her room. Hedra puts her hand on her face. HEDRA Oh... 
ALLISON'S APARTMENT - ALLISON'S BEDROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison enters her room coming from the hall. 
HEDRA (voice over from the hall) Leave the door open so we can talk. 
Allison grabs a pair of pants and puts them on. 
Hedra enters slowly in the room, carrying the large paper bag where she has put the gun. 
Allison takes her night shirt off. She is now naked from the waist up. But she grabs a sweater and puts it on. 
HEDRA You know why I think you're sick ? 
While talking, Hedra slowly slides her hand into the paper bag, takes a pair of black gloves out of the bag and puts the bag down on the floor. 
HEDRA You're upset about Sam. 
Slowly, Hedra puts the black gloves on her hands. 
HEDRA You know Sam's dead, don't you ? 
Allison turns around to face Hedra. 
HEDRA Yeah, we don't have much time. 
She picks up the bag and walks to a chest of drawers. She puts the bag on the floor and opens the top drawer. 
ALLISON (crying) You didn't... you didn't do it, Hedy, did you ? 
Hedra is taking white pantie and bra from the drawer 
ALLISON (crying) You couldn't have him ! 
She falls down, sitting on the floor and crying. 
ALLISON Why ?... Why ? 
HEDRA Allie, he came in my mouth. Then he tried to beat the shit out of me because I wanted to tell you. 
She slams the drawer shut, and opens another one. HEDRA You know, it was an accident. But he deserved it. 
She claps her hands. 
HEDRA Okay, come on. The police will be here soon. 
Allison doesn't move and remains seated on the floor. 
ALLISON But... but you shouldn't run. That'll only make it worse. I know you weren't yourself when you did this, Hedy. 
Hedra laughs. 
HEDRA I know. I was you. 
She points her gloved finger to Allison, and then looks at herself in the mirror. HEDRA Who is this Hedy anyway ? 
She turns around, and walks away from the mirror towards Allison. 
HEDRA No one's seen her. She's not on the lease. There's not even a fingerprint of hers here. I've been cleaning like crazy. You have to come with me, Allie, or they'd put you away. 
ALLISON Hedy, it'll never work. Besides ... people have seen you. We just can't tell. We'll go to a lawyer or a doctor and they'll explain it to the police, or something. 
Hedra, who is now very upset, knocks everything, that was on top of the chest of drawer, with a long sweeping movement, down on the floor. 
Reverse angle shot. Allison looks at the remote control on the armrest. 
Close up on the remote control. Almost at the top of the remote control, we see the two volume control buttons : up and down. And under those buttons, we see the two channel control buttons. 
Close up on Allison's face looking at the remote control. 
Close up on Allison's right hand moving the remote control on the armrest, to get the volume control buttons within reach of her forefinger. She presses the up button. On the TV screen, we see the volume bar graph going up on the picture of a crocodile. And the volume of the music goes up too. 
Allison looks at the remote control again. 
Close up on Allison's forefinger pressing one of the channel control buttons. 
On the screen, we see a different channel : a comic movie. A couple is having dinner in a restaurant and the waiter pours the water bucket on the man. 
Another channel. A woman is sleeping. A telephone rings. 
Reverse angle shot on Allison pressing the channel control buttons. We hear a male voice for a couple of second, then Allison changes the channel again. 
The TV screen seen from behind Allison's hand dialing on the remote control. There is a cartoon on the screen. Then another channel showing the concert of a rock music band. 
Close up on Allison's face looking at the screen and then at the remote control in her hand. 
Reverse angle shot on the TV set. The volume bar graph is going up again until it reaches the end of the graph. The volume of the sound of the rock music is very high. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
We hear the rock music very loudly in the empty hall. 
The front door of apartment 1206 opens slowly. A man with glasses on his nose peeks into the hall. He seems very annoyed by the noise. BANK OFFICE - HALL - INTERIOR DAY 
Close up on the hand of Hedra writing «Ellen Besch» on the back of a cheque on the cashier's counter. In front of her, we see the hands of the cashier girl on the other side of the glass partition. 
CASHIER GIRL (voice over) What's the part this time ? 
Larger view of the bank office hall. Hedra is standing in front of the cashier's desk. We see the cashier girl through the partition glass. Behind Hedra, a man is waiting for his turn, reading a newspaper. 
HEDRA Excuse me ? 
Through the opening at the bottom of the partition, she gives her cheque to the girl. Closer shot. Now we are on the cashier's side of the partition, and we see Hedra's face through the glass. 
CASHIER GIRL You're an actress, right ? You're never the same person twice. 
Reverse angle shot. We are now on Hedra's side of the partition, and we see the cashier girl through the glass : she is a blonde girl about the same age as Hedra. She puts her finger on her own hair. 
CASHIER GIRL I like it. I just thought the other was more you. 
Reverse angle shot. Cashier's side. 
HEDRA Well, maybe next time I'll try blonde. 
Reverse angle shot. Hedra's side. The cashier girl smiles. 
CASHIER GIRL Really ? I'm flattered. Thanks. 
A male bank clerk, sitting at a desk behind the cashier girl, stands up and walks to the partition glass. 
BANK CLERK Miss Besch ? 
HEDRA Yes ? 
BANK CLERK A man's been calling here. Says he's your father. 
Reverse angle shot. Cashier's side. Hedra seems worried by what the man is saying. 
BANK CLERK (voice over) Might even come to New York if you don't call him. 
Hedra runs away from the counter. 
BANK CLERK (voice over) Miss Besch ! 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
On the TV set, the rock band is still playing with the sound volume very loud. 
Reverse angle shot on Allison, trying to free herself from the armchair where she is tied up. But the duct tape is strong enough and her jerky movements don't bring any result. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR DAY Outside Graham's apartment. We hear the loud rock music very clearly. The building manager is standing by the door, with the neighbor from apartment 1206 behind him. The neighbor has his glasses hanging around his neck on a string. 
The building manager rings the bell. Then he bangs on the door with his fist. 
BUILDING MANAGER Hey ! 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Allison turns her head towards the front door and try to speak through the tape stuck on her mouth. 
ALLISON Mmmm ! 
She starts moving again to free herself from the armchair, but she doesn't succeed. 
The bell rings again. Allison turns her heard towards the front door. 
A BUSY STREET IN NEW-YORK - EXTERIOR DAY 
Slowly, Allison moves her mouth away from Hedra's one. 
ALLISON (whispering) Don't make me leave you, Ellen. 
Hedra slowly raises up. She has a strange look on her face. She seems not to understand the situation anymore. 
Close-up on Allison's head and throat. We can see the slightly bloody marks left by the serrated blade. Allison looks at Hedra moving away from her with an anxious face. 
Hedra kneels down in front of Allison. She bends down to rest her face on Allison's lap, and starts crying. Allison moves her hand as far as she can and strokes Hedra's hair. 
ALLISON Shhh !... It's okay. It's okay. 
Close-up on a wallet on the floor, close to Allison's foot. Allison is trying to reach it with her foot, but she can't because of her leg still being taped on the armchair. 
ALLISON (voice over) We've got to get out of here now. 
She eventually succeeds in kicking the wallet away from the armchair. And she keeps on stroking Hedra's hair, still crying on her lap. 
NEW YORK - EXTERIOR EVENING 
Large overview of the city. There is still daylight, but we can tell, by the color of the sky, that we are getting closer to the night. 
FONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR EVENING 
In the forefront, Mitchell's assistant, Barbara, is typing on the keyboard of a computer. Behind her, we see rows of dresses on hangers. Suddenly, the woman stares at the screen. We hear strange clicking and beeping noises coming from the computer. 
BARBARA Jesus... 
She stands up, with horror in her face, and yells. 
BARBARA Mitch ! 
FONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MITCHELL'S OFFICE - INTERIOR EVENING 
The room is much smaller, and quite dark. A blonde woman is sitting on an armchair in front of a desk. Mitchell is standing behind her. Mitchell is slightly rocking the armchair and the blonde woman's eyes are closed. 
MITCHELL What ? He doesn't stop rocking the armchair. 
BARBARA (voice over from the main hall) Get in here. 
MITCHELL What ? 
He reluctantly leaves the armchair and walks out of the room. 
FONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MAIN HALL - INTERIOR EVENING 
Mitchell crosses the hall 
MITCHELL What is it ? What? 
The computer is still making strange beeping noises. On the screen, pictures of dresses appear and then disappear immediately. 
BARBARA Look. 
Close up on the screen. A data chart titled «Fontana Fashions» has appeared. The extreme left column is labelled «Expenses», and underneath, a list of all the expenses (Lease - Telephone - Payroll - Liabilities... and son on). The other columns on the right are labelled «Jan» to «Apr», and underneath lists of numbers corresponding to the various monthly expenses. 
But, the data chart has hardly appeared on the screen that the columns of numbers start erasing themselves one by one, starting with January. 
BARBARA It's erasing. 
Then, when all the numbers have been erased, a window appears on the screen with «LOST!» written in red letters in it. 
Another data chart appears on the screen : the expenses from May to August. And, on this chart, the columns of numbers also start to erase themselves. 
Mitchell looks severely at Barbara. She raises her hands. 
BARBARA I didn't do anything. 
Suddenly, Mitchell seems to remember something. 
MITCHELL Shit ! 
He runs away toward his office. 
The blonde woman is standing in the doorway of the office. Mitchell brutally pushes her away. 
FONTANA FASHION OFFICE - MITCHELL'S OFFICE - INTERIOR EVENING Mitchell types something on the keyboard of his computer. We hear the computer beeping. 
Close-up on the computer screen. A data chart titled «Production line», and underneath «Fontana Fashions Production Line». Underneath, four columns of numbers labelled «Order», «Sam», «Scheduled» and «Completed». All the numbers in these columns are erasing themselves. And then appears the window with «LOST!» in red letters. 
MITCHELL (voice over) On mine, too ! 
Then another rectangular window appears on the screen. On the left of the window, the drawing of a bomb with a lighted wick sticking out of it. On the rest of the window, the following text : 
The last payment in Fulfillment of the Contract between Fontana Fashions and Allison Jones is now past due. Please contact Allison Jones at 212-555-9814 within 24 Hours of the rest of your data will be irretrievably lost. 
Mitchell bends down to have a better look at the screen. 
Close up on the screen, while Mitchell reads out loud : 
MITCHELL (voice over) The last payment in Fulfillment of the Contract between Fontana Fashions and Allison Jones is past due. Please contact Allison Jones... 
Medium shot of Mitchell reading what's written on the screen. 
HEDRA Going down. 
The outer door closes in front of a bewildered Mitchell.

Hedra opens the door of Allison's private «cage», and enters the cage. She tries to open a suitcase, but doesn't succeed. She slaps nervously the suitcase. She then finds another suitcase, which is open. She tries to fit herself inside the suitcase, and more or less succeeds. She seems very nervous. She gets out of the suitcase, closes it and carries it out of the cage. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR EVENING Close up on the numbers above the door. They go from «9» to «10», and then to «11». 
Hedra is watching the numbers. The elevator stops. 
The outer door opens. Mitchell is there, waiting for the elevator. He opens the inner door and comes in the cabin. The outer door closes automatically and the elevator cabin starts moving up again 
He looks at the control panel, where the 12th floor is lighted. Then he looks at Hedra, who looks back at him with a rather unwelcoming face. 
The elevator stops and Mitchell goes out first. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Through the windows, we can see that night has come. 
Mitchell goes out of the elevator, followed by Hedra pulling her suitcase behind her. Hedra goes directly to Graham's apartment. Mitchell first goes in the opposite direction, and then comes back towards Hedra. 
MITCHELL Oh... Excuse me, miss, is this 1203 ? Is Graham Knox at home ? 
Hedra is now in front of Graham's door and puts the key in the keyhole. Mitchell has caught up with her, and is standing behind her. 
HEDRA No, he's on a cruise. 
MITCHELL Actually, I'm looking for a woman Allison Jones ? Do you know her ? 
Hedra suddenly stops unlocking the door. 
HEDRA Who are you ? 
MITCHELL Mitchell Myerson. 
Hedra turns around to face Mitchell. 
MITCHELL She did a job for me. 
HEDRA Oh... There's no one named Jones on this floor. 
MITCHELL Yeah, I know that. I was just down at her apartment. But I did contact her here once. HEDRA Well, I'm the only one here and I never met her. So... You'll excuse me. 
She bends down to pick up the suitcase. 
MITCHELL Oh, sorry. 
Mitchell bends down to help her. He picks up the suitcase and looks at it. 
MITCHELL This is hers. You do know her. 
We hear a muffled scream coming from inside the apartment. 
Hedra opens the door to get inside as fast as possible, but Mitchell catches her and throws her aside. More muffled screams coming from the apartment. Mitchell rushes into the apartment, and closes the door shut behind him. Hedra rushes to the door, but too late. 
GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Mitchell rushes into the room, stops and looks down. 
Allison is lying on the carpet, completely tied up in duct tape, looking like a human salami. She is gagged by another piece of tape. When she sees Mitchell, she starts wriggling and screaming through her gag. 
MITCHELL (voice over) What the fuck is going on here ? 
He kneels down and tears the tape off her mouth. 
ALLISON Be careful, she's crazy. 
Hedra enters the room, pointing her gun towards Mitchell. 
HEDRA Get off of her. 
Mitchell, still kneeling down across Allison's body, turns around. 
MITCHELL What ? 
Hedra walks towards him, still pointing her gun with both hands in front of her. 
HEDRA You think she wants you touching her, huh ? I said get off her ! 
MITCHELL Okay, okay... I'm... I'm getting up. Okay. He gets up very slowly with his hands raised at his shoulders level. And suddenly, he grabs the gun and throws Hedra across the room. She falls on a round table, which breaks under her weight. She remains motionless on the floor. 
Allison looks anxiously at the scene, but, from her lying position on the carpet, doesn't see everything. 
Mitchell puts the gun inside his belt and kneels down to untie Allison. 
ALLISON Where is she ? 
MITCHELL Don't worry about her, I took care of her. 
Hedra suddenly comes behind him, and strikes him very hard on the head with a statuette. He falls down on the floor. Hedra rushes to him and picks up the gun from his belt. She takes a cushion from the back of an armchair, puts the cushion on Mitchell's face and presses the barrel of the gun on the cushion. Allison screams. 
Allison succeeds in pulling Hedra out of the apartment. Hedra grabs the front door with both hands to try to resist Allison's pull. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - LANDING HALL OUTSIDE GRAHAM'S APARTMENT - INTERIOR NIGHT 
Allison pulls a little harder, and Hedra's hands are squeezed by the door. She screams. Allison lets go of Hedra's legs to close the door shut. 
ALLISON Graham, stay inside ! 
GRAHAM (voice over from inside the apartment) All right. Allison runs away towards the elevator. Hedra, still lying on the floor, raises her gun towards Allison and shoots. 
Allison screams : she's been shot in the left shoulder. Hedra shoots again, but Allison hides behind the corner of the wall of the hall. 
Hedra gets up to run after Allison. 
Close up on the elevator. Allison is already inside the cabin and closes the inner door just as Hedra reaches the elevator. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - ELEVATOR CABIN - INTERIOR DAY 
HEDRA No... No... No... 
Allison pulls Hedra right arm through the vertical bars of the inner door, and opens it again, squeezing Hedra's arm very hard. Hedra screams and drops her gun on the cabin floor. Allison closes the inner door shut. 
Close up of Allison's hand picking the gun up from the floor. 
HEDRA No... No... No... 
Hedra watches the outer door closing slowly. 
Allison points the gun towards Hedra and presses the trigger several times. But nothing happens : there are no more cartridge in the chamber of the gun. 
Hedra opens the inner door to get into the elevator. Allison tries to prevent her from getting in, but Hedra eventually succeeds in getting into the cabin. She closes the inner door, and the outer door closes itself automatically. Hedra throws Allison against the wall of the cabin. Then she bangs her head very hard against the wall. Allison pulls Hedra away from her. Hedra hits the wall on the other side of the cabin, and falls on the floor. Allison rushes and falls on Hedra, but Hedra pushes her away from her. 
The two girls start fighting in the cabin. They fall on the floor, Hedra on top of Allison. Hedra tries to strangle Allison. 
Close up of Allison's face choking under the pressure of Hedra's hands. 
Short reverse angle close up shot of Hedra's face, then back to Allison's face. 
Close up on the screwdriver hanging from its chain and rocking gently with the movement of the elevator. Allison's hand tries to catch it and doesn't succeed. 
Back on Allison's face, suffocating more and more under Hedra's strangulation. Back, for a couple of seconds, to Allison's hand trying to catch the screwdriver, and then back to her suffocating face. 
Close up on Allison's hand which has eventually caught the screwdriver, then back to her face. The face slowly relaxes as Allison falls into unconsciousness. Her arm, which was extended to catch the screwdriver, falls on the floor of the cabin. 
Hedra watches Allison's face intently. Then, when she realizes that Allison is unconscious, she bends down and kisses her on the cheek. She brings Allison's both arms along Allison's sides, then she puts her head on her chest and kisses her hand. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
The outer door of the elevator opens, and, through the vertical bars of the inner door, we can see Allison still lying on her back on the floor of the cabin. Hedra opens the inner door, then pulls Allison by the legs out of the elevator. 
HEDRA (snorting under the effort of pulling Allison) Huh... Huh... 
She pulls Allison along the corridor of the basement. 
She reaches the door opening on the emergency staircase, and kicks it shut. 
She suddenly stops and looks intently at Allison lying on the floor. She grabs a green blanket on a shelf and wraps Allison's face in it. 
She pushes a a heavy metallic storage shelves cabinet along the wall all the way to the emergency staircase door, in order to prevent it from being opened by anyone coming from the staircase. 
Then she pulls down a big lever on the wall on the side of the cage where the elevator machinery is enclosed. We supposed it is the emergency switch of the elevator, and that she also wants to prevent anyone coming down to the basement from using the elevator. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - INCINERATOR ROOM - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra picks up some pieces of dry wood from a wheelbarrow and puts them inside the incinerator, where some flames are still burning. 
ALLISON'S BUILDING - BASEMENT - INTERIOR DAY 
Hedra pushes the empty wheelbarrow along the corridor of the basement. 
Suddenly she stops, drops the wheelbarrow and emits a short scream. 
Reverse angle shot on the green blanket on the floor. Allison is gone. 
Hedra looks very worried. 
HEDRA Allie ? 
She runs to the blanket, but doesn't stop and keeps on running to the elevator. She gives a quick look inside the open cabin, then tries to open a large locked gate, near the elevator, but doesn't succeed. 
HEDRA (yelling) Allie ? 
She goes back along the corridor the way she came from. Near the place where she left the wheelbarrow, she comes to a door marked «Storage», and opens it 
HEDRA Hey, here you are. 
But this is just a closet full of various junk. 
Hedra thinks she heard something and quickly turns around. She takes a big iron hook from the storage closet and starts walking menacingly along the corridor. 
HEDRA Don't make me come get you... Allie, come out now... Come on... Allie !... 
She bangs the hook on a vertical pipe on the wall.

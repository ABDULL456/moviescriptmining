THROATS SLASHED THE PEOPLE in the pew in front gasp. FLAN and OUISA are serious. THE QUARTET plays The Wedding March. EVERYONE stands. THE BRIDE and her FATHER walk down the aisle. CU OUISA'S FACE lost in thought. Bright vivid colors fill the screen. Later we will learn they are from a double-sided painting by Kandinsky, which 
HANGS IN 
THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM. 
OUISA (VO) 
Chaos. OUISA'S face appears briefly, smiling, then is replaced by dark, geometric patterns. The other side of the painting. It is lowered to reveal OUISA very serious. 
OUISA (VO) Control. (The painting is flipped.) Chaos. (OUISA smiles. Flips it again. Frowns.) Control. 
BACK IN THE CHAPEL OUISA, still frowning at her memory, realizes the wedding ceremony is over. THE BRIDE and the GROOM run up the aisle beaming at EVERYONE to the strains of Lohengrin. But even THEY slow down when THEY see the state FLAN and OUISA are in. 
GROOM Is everything all FLAN snaps out of it, putting on his party smile. 
FLAN We always get this way at weddings. THE BRIDE and GROOM resume their run up the aisle. It's FLAN and OUISA's turn to leave the pew and go up the aisle. SHE is stricken. 
OUISA I do not always get this way at weddings. 
FLAN We're alive. THEY walk up the aisle into the foyer of the chapel. SHE puts her head into his shoulder. 
OUISA Oh, it was awful awful awful awful. Then OUISA and FLAN put on their best smiles as THEY pass through a receiving line, finally shaking hands with the 
WEDDING COUPLE. 
BRIDE 
Did you say you could have been killed? 
OUISA (MERRY) Yes! Only hours ago! 
FLAN (MERRY) But we're here! 
OUISA Wouldn't miss it! THE BRIDE and GROOM look after THEM. 
EXT THE MILLBROOK GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB DAY A spankingly bright and solid country club in Millbrook New York situated on the golf course grounds surrounded by lots of tennis courts. 
INT MILLBROOK CLUB DAY THE WEDDING GUESTS file into the cheery club, all bright white and a shade of cheery green that only country clubs seem to find. MORE GUESTS than could f it into the CHAPEL are here in the club waiting for the Bride and Groom. FLAN and OUISA hesitate before going into the ballroom. 
THEY stop in the small quiet dark clubby BAR. THEY sit at a small table, pulling themselves together. SANDY and CONNIE (the people from the pew in front of them) come up to THEM. A WOMAN who looks like a dormouse is with them. SHE is named JULIA. 
SANDY We hate to pry - 
FLAN No no. You're not prying 
CONNIE But what happened - 
SANDY This is our friend Julia 
FLAN Do we know each other? 
JULIA Oh yes through... 
9 FLAN Of course. Haven't seen them in years FLAN shakes hands with the new acquaintance. 
CONNIE We're worried for you FLAN and OUISA look at each other. 
OUISA Tell them! SANDY and CONNIE and JULIA sit down at the small table. 
FLAN We were having a wonderful evening last night. 
OUISA A friend we hadn't seen for many years came by for dinner. I don't think you know him - 
FLAN (PORTENTOUSLY) Geoffrey Miller. From South Africa-- 
OUISA Don't say it so portentously. 
FLAN (BRIGHT) Geoffrey from South Africa. 
OUISA Don't be ga-ga. (THEY give their orders to THE BARTENDER.) Something large. 
SANDY I didn't know Geoffrey was in town. 
JULIA I saw him at Susie Baxter's 
SANDY I wasn't at Susie Baxter's 
CONNIE Sandy forgets he was married to Susie Baxter. THE WAITER goes. 
SAVOY That's no reason why she can't invite me to a party. CONNIE whispers to JULIA, her eyes on FLAN. 
FLAN Geoffrey, you have to move out of South Africa. You'll be killed. Why do you stay in South Africa? 
GEOFFREY One has to stay there to educate the black workers and we'll know we've been successful when they kill us. 
FLAN Planning the revolution that will destroy you. 
OUISA sits back on the comfy sofa amazed at the thought. 
OUISA Putting your life on the line. 
GEOFFREY You don't think of it like that. I wish you'd come visit. OUISA takes her drink and strokes the ears of her dog. 
OUISA But we'd visit you and sit in your gorgeous house planning trips into the townships demanding to see the poorest of the poor. "Are you sure they're the worst off? I mean, we've come all this way. We don't want to see people just mildly victimized by apartheid. We demand shock." It doesn't seem right sitting on the East Side talking about revolution. 
FLAN Only small murky cafes for Pepe le Noko here. 
OUISA No. La Passionaria. I will come to South Africa and build barricades and lean against them, singing. 
FLAN And the people would follow. 
OUISA "Follow Follow Follow". What's that song? 
FLAN The way Gorbachev cheered on the striking coal miners in the Ukraine - yes, you must strike- it is your role in history to dismantle this system. Russia and Poland - you can't believe the developments in the world - (HE remembers:) "The Fantasticks" (SINGS:) "Follow Follow Follow". 
OUISA China. FLAN and OUISA (despair) Oh. 
GEOFFREY Oy vay China. As my grandmother would say. Our role in history. And we offer ourselves up 
to it. 
FLAN That is your role in history. Not our role. OUISA ponders this thought. 
OUISA A role in history. To say that so easily. GEOFFREY suddenly gets up and looks through the telescope by the window. 
GEOFFREY'S POV GEOFFREY flashes down nine floors into Central Park. HE frowns in puzzlement when HE sees 
A STATUE OF AN ALASKAN HUSKY baying up into the sky. FLAN and OUISA look at GEOFFREY's back and then at each other. How to keep the ball rolling? FLAN (to Geoffrey) Do you want another drink before we-- 
GEOFFREY turns into the room. 
GEOFFREY Wonderful view. 
OUISA The phrase - striking coal miners - I see all these very striking coal miners modelling the fall fashions. 
GEOFFREY Where should we? 
FLAN There's good Szechuan. And Hunan. 
OUISA The sign painter screwed up the sign. Instead of The Hunan Wok, he painted The Human Wok. 
GEOFFREY God! The restaurants! New York has become the Florence of the Sixteenth Century. Genius on every corner. 
OUISA I don't think genius has kissed the Human Wok. THEY finish off their drinks. 
GEOFFREY The new Italian looked cheery. FLAN and OUISA Good. 
FLAN We made reservations. FLAN looks at the slide projector. 
FLAN Geoffrey, I'd like to show - FLAN'S sentence hangs in mid-air as GEOFFREY follows OUISA 
INTO 
THE HALL. OUISA burrows in the closet getting her coat and GEOFFREY's coat out of the hall closet stuffed with tennis rackets and skis and boots. 
OUISA This restaurant - they wrap ravioli up like salt water taffy. FLAN appears behind HER to help HER. THEY both wrestle the coats out of the closet. 
FLAN Six on a plate for a few hundred dollars. And FLAN gets the coats. A clatter of tennis rackets falling. GEOFFREY takes his topcoat. 
GEOFFREY You have to come to South Africa so I can pay you back. I'll take you on my plane into the Okavango Swamps - 
OUISA Did you hear - to take back to Johannesburg. out in Eastharpton 
FLAN 
LAST WEEKEND 
OUISA a guy goes into one of the better food stores - 
FLAN Dean and DeLuca - FLAN helps OUISA on with her coat. 
OUISA one of the Dean and DeLuca look alikes. Gets a pack of cigarettes and an ice cream bar. Goes up front. Sees there's a line at the register. Slaps down two twenty dollar bills and goes out. GEOFFREY doesn't get the anecdote. 
OUISA You darling old poop - 
FLAN Have you seen the new book on Cezanne? 
GEOFFREY 
NO 
OUISA An absolute revelation - this'll only take a mo- OUISA rushes out of the bathroom after GEOFFREY. 
FLAN I need the gauze 
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR 
OUISA I ran down the hall to get the book on Cezanne, got the gauze from my bathroom-- 
BACK AT THE KITTREDGE'S We watch a flustered OUSIA dart about as she describes-- 
OUISA (VO) Gave the Cezanne to Flan who wanted the gauze, gave the gauze to Geoffrey who wanted Cezanne. OUISA mutters under her breath as she dashes down 
THE HALL. 
OUISA two million dollars two million dollars 
AND INTO 
THE LIVING ROOM 
GEOFFREY stares at the gauze he's just been handed. 
FLAK'S VOICE ouisa? OUISA grabs the gauze out of GEOFFREY's hand. SHE runs back down the HALL. 
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR 
OUISA Two million dollars two million dollars-- 
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S BATHROOM FLAN finishes bandaging PAUL's wound. OUISA goes into 
HER SON'S BEDROOM., SHE takes a pink shirt from the bureau. 
THE MASTER BEDROOM PAUL puts on the pink shirt and looks at HIMSELF in the mirror. 
FLAN He's going to be fine. GEOFFREY appears in the door with the book on Cezanne. 
GEOFFREY Lovely book. FLAN looks stricken. 
OUISA Please? Stay? GEOFFREY pauses. 
GEOFFREY Agreed. FLAN beams. 
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR 
OUISA And peace was restored. 
BACK IN THE MASTER BEDROOM FLAN holds out PAUL's blazer. PAUL winces as HE lifts his arms to put it on. 
PAUL Your children said you were kind. All the kids were sitting around the dorm one night dishing the- shit out of their parents. But your kids were silent and said No, not our parents. Not Flan and Ouisa. Not the Kittredges. The Kittredges are kind. So after the muggers left, I looked up and saw these Fifth Avenue apartments. Mrs. Onassis lives there. I know the Babcocks live over there. The Auchinclosses live there. But you lived here. I came here. OUISA, so touched, turns to FLAN and GEOFFREY. 
OUISA Can you believe what the kids said? PAUL looks at the framed photos on wall of 
0 THE HALL. 
PAUL But your kids - I love them. Talbot and Woody mean the world to me. 
FLAN He lets you call him Woody? Nobody's called him Woody in years. THEY come into 
THE LIVING ROOM. PAUL looks around happily. HE goes to the wall by the mantlepiece and looks at a dark abstract painting. 
PAUL They described this apartment in detail. This is a Kandinsky! - a double. One painted on either side. May I see - ? OUISA lifts the painting off the wall and turns it around. Even GEOFFREY is taken by the painting. 
FLAN What makes it valuable is Kandinsky painted on either side of the canvas in two wildly different styles. One side is geometric and somr=r. The other side is wild and vivid. 
GEOFFREY My god! 
FLAN We flip it around for variety. OUISA happily turns the painting back and forth to show off its two sides. The SCREEN is filled with the bright colors then the dark colors. 
OUISA You like? You like? Chaos? Control? Chaos? Control? SHE puts on a goofy happy face for the chaotic side and a dopey tragic face for the geometric. Yes. We've been here before, through OUISA's memory, at the wedding. 
PAUL It's wonderful. OUISA leans the painting against a chair, the chaotic side showing. 
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR FLAN turns to JULIA. 
FLAN And he told us. 
OUISA He named the greatest black star in movies. 
SIDNEY - 
FLAN Don't say it. We're trying to keep this abstract. Plus libel laws. 
OUISA Sidney Poitiers There. I don't care. We have to have truth. He started out as a lawyer and is terrified of libel. I'm not. 
INT THE WHITE WALL PAUL, leaning against the wall, talks with great vivacity to that OFF SCREEN PRESENCE who is the POV of the camera. 
PAUL Sidney Poitier, the future Jackie Robinson of films, was born the twenty fourth of February 1927 in Miami during a visit his parents made to Florida - legally? -to sell tomatoes they had grown on their farm in the Bahamas. He grew up on Cat Island, "so poor they didn't even own dirt" he has said. Neglected by his family, my father would sit on the shore, and, as he told me many times, "conjure up the kind of worlds that were on the other side and what I'd do in them." He arrived in New York City from the Bahamas in the winter of 1943 at age fifteen and a half and lived in the pay toilet of the bus station across from the old Madison Square Garden at Fiftieth and Eighth Avenue. He moved to the roof of the Brill building, commonly known as Tin Pan Alley. Washed dishes at the Turf restaurant for $4.11 a night. He taught 0 himself to read by reading the newspaper. In the Black newspaper, the theater page was opposite the Want Ad page. Among his 42 films are No Way Out 1950/ Cry the Beloved Country 1952/ Blackboard Jungle 1955/ The Defiant Ones 1958/ Raisin in the Sun 1961/ Lilies of the Field 1963/ In the Heat of the Night 1967/ To Sir With Love 1967/ Shoot to Kill 1988 and, of course, 
PAUSE. (THE OFF SCREEN VOICE JOINS HIM) Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. 
PAUL (LAUGHS) He won the Oscar for Lilies of the Field and was twice named top male box-office star in the country. My father made no films from 1977 to 1987 but worked as director and author. Dad said to me once "I still don't fully understand how all that came about in the sequence it came about". And we hear the OFF SCREEN PRESENCE applauding. PAUL bows, happily. HE kicks his shoe off into the camera. 
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM 
PAUL Dad's not in till tomorrow at the Sherry. I came down from Cambridge. Thought I'd stay at some fleabag for adventure. Orwell. Down and Out. I really don't know New York. I know Rome and Paris and Los Angeles a lot better. 
OUISA We're-going out to dinner. You'll come. 
PAUL Out to dinner? 
FLAN Out to dinner. 
PAUL But why go out to dinner? 
OUISA Because we have reservations and oh my god'what time is it? Have we lost the reservations and we don't have a damn thing in the house and it's Sixteenth century Florence and there's genius on every block. 
GEOFFREY Don't mock. SHE kisses GEOFFREY. 
PAUL You must have something in the fridge. 
FLAN A frozen steak from the Ice Age. 
PAUL Why spend a hundred dollars on a bowl of rice? Let me into the kitchen. Cooking calms me. What I'd like to do is calm down, pay back your kids- 
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR 
OUISA He mentioned our kids names-- 
FLAN turns to a NEWCOMER. 
FLAN Two. Two at Harvard. A daughter at Groton. 
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM 
PAUL - who've been wonderful to me. 
OUISA They've never mentioned you. 
FLAN What are they supposed to say? We've become friends with the son of Sidney Poitier, barrier breaker of the fifties and sixties? 
GEOFFREY Your father means a great deal in South Africa. 
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR 
OUISA Even Geoffrey was touched. 
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM 
PAUL I'm glad of that. Dad and I went to Russia once to a film festival and he was truly amazed how much his presence meant - 
OUISA Oh no! Tell us stories of movie stars tying up their children and being cruel. 
PAUL I wish. 
GEOFFREY You wish? 
PAUL If I wanted to write a book about him. I really can't. No one would want to read it. He's decent. I admire him. 
OUISA He's married to an actress who was in one of-- she's white? Am I right? 
PAUL (painful territory) That is not my mother. That is his second wife. He met Joanna making "The Lost Man". He left my mother who had stuck by him in the lean years. X had just been born. "The Lost Man" is the only film of my father's I can't bring myself to see. 
OUISA Oh, I'm sorry. We didn't mean to - 
PAUL (BRIGHT) No! We're all good friends now. . His kids from that marriage. Us - the old kids. I'd love to get in that kitchen. FLAN (to Ouisa) What should we do? 
FLAN Hello? PAUL returns with the rest of the real in brightly painted bowls. 
PAUL Seconds? THEY laugh and are served. 
OUISA Have you declared your major yet? 
PAUL You're like all parents. What's your major? 
FLAN Geoffrey, Harvard has all those great titles the students give courses. 
OUISA The Holocaust and Ethics? 
FLAN Krauts and Doubts. 
OUISA I think we're lucky having this dinner. Isn't this the finest time? A toast to you. 
GEOFFREY To Cats! 
FLAN Blunt question. What's he like? 
OUISA reaches for the bottle of wine. 
OUISA Let's not be star fuckers. 
FLAN I'm not a star fucker. 
PAUL My father, being an actor, has no real identity. You say to him, Pop, what's new? And he says, 'I got an interesting script today. I was asked to play a lumberjack up in the Yukon. Now, I've been trained as a Preacher, but my church fell apart. My wife says we have to get mbney to get through this winter. And I sign up as part of this team where all my beliefs are challenged. But I hold firm. In spite of prejudice because I want to get back to my wife. Out of this forest,back to the church... .' And my father is in tears and I say Pop, this i:. not a real event, this is some script that was sent to you. And my father says ' I' m trying it out to see how it fits on me.' But he has no life--he has no memory--only the scripts producers send him in the mail through his agents. That's his past. 
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR Can it be? The CROWD listening to FLAN and OUISA is even larger. 
OUISA I just loved the kid so much. I wanted to reach out to him. 
FLAN And then we asked him what his thesis was on. 
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S DINING ROOM 
GEOFFREY The one that was stolen. Please? 
PAUL Well... (HE takes a deep breath and leans back in 
HIS CHAIR) A substitute teacher out on Long Island was dropped from his job for fighting with a student. A few weeks later, the teacher returned to the classroom, shot the student unsuccessfully, held the class hostage and then shot himself. Successfully. This fact caught my eye: last sentence. Times. A neighbor described the teacher as a nice boy. Always reading Catcher In the Rye. The nitwit - Chapman - who shot John Lennon said he did it because he wanted to-`draw the attention of the world to Catcher In the Rye and the reading of that book would be his defense. And young Hinckley, the whiz kid who shot Reagan and his press secretary said if you want my defense all you have to do is read catcher in the Rye. It seemed to be time to read it again. 
FLAN I haven't read it in years. OUISA shushes FLAN. 
PAUL I borrowed a copy from a young friend of mine because I wanted to see what she had underlined and I read this book to find out why this touching, beautiful, sensitive story published in July 1951 had turned into this manifesto of hate. I started reading. : It's exactly as I remembered. Everybody's a phoney. Page two: "My brother's in Hollywood being a prostitute." Page three: "what a phony slob his father was." Page nine: "People never notice anything." Then on page twenty two my hair stood up. Remember Holden Caulfield--the definitive sensitive youth--wearing his red hunter's cap. "A deer Hunter hat? Like hell it is. I sort of closed one eye like I was taking aim at it. This is a people shooting hat. I shoot people in this hat." 
PAUL (CONTINUES) Hmmm, I said. This book is preparing people for bigger moments in their lives than I ever dreamed of. Then on p. 89 "I'd rather push a guy out the window or chop his head off with an ax than sock him in the jaw. I hate fist fights...what scares me most is the other guy's face..." I finished the book. It's a touching story, comic because the boy wants to do so much and can't do anything. Hates all phoniness and only lies to others. Wants everyone to like him, is only hateful, and is completely self involved. In other words, a pretty accurate picture of a male adolescent. FLAN, OUISA, .GEOFFREY are transfixed. And what alarms me about that book--not the book so much as the aura about it--is this: the book is primarily about paralysis. The boy can't function. And at the end before he can run away and start a new life, it starts to rain and he folds. Now there's nothing wrong in writing about emotional and intellectual paralysis. It may indeed thanks to Chekhov and Samuel Beckett be the great modern theme. The extraordinary last lines of Waiting For Godot--"Let's go." "Yes, let's go." Stage directions: They do not move. But the aura around this book of Salinger's-- which perhaps should be read by everyone ut young men---is this: It mirrors like a fun house mirror and amplifies like a distorted speaker one of the great tragedies of our times- --the death of the imagination. Because what else is paralysis? The CAMERA moves closer and closer in on PAUL. 
PAUL (CONTINUES) The imagination has been so debased that imagination--being imaginative-- rather than being the lynch pin of our existence now stands as a synonym for something outside ourselves like Science fiction or some new use for tangerine slices on raw pork chops---what an imaginative summer recipe--and Star wars! So imaginative and Star Trek--so imaginative! And Lord of the Rings--all those dwarves--so 
IMAGINATIVE--- The imagination has moved out of the realm of being our link, our most personal link, with our inner lives and the world outside that world-- this world we share--what is schizophrenia but a horrifying state where what's in here doesn't match up with what's out there? Why has imagination become a synonym for style? I believe that the imagination is the passport we create to take us into the real world. I believe the imagination is another phrase for what is most uniquely Is. 
Jung says the greatest sin is to be unconscious. Our boy Holden says "what scares me most is the other guy's face--it wouldn't be so bad if you could both be blindfolded"--most of the time the faces we face are not the other guys' but our own faces. And it's the worst kind of yellowness to be so scared of yourself you put blindfolds on rather than deal with yourself. To face ourselves. That's the hard thing. The imagination. That's God's gift to make the act of self- examination bearable. 
PAUSE. FLAN, GEOFFREY, OUISA are very moved. 
OUISA Well, indeed. 
FLAN I hope your muggers read every word. 
OUISA (chiding FLAN) 
DARLING 
GEOFFREY I'm going to buy a copy of Catcher i. the Rye at the airport and read it. 
OUISA Cover to cover 
PAUL I'll test you. I should be going. PAUL starts to go. THEY follow. THE DINING ROOM opens into 
THE LIVING ROOM. 
FLAN Where will you stay? 
OUISA Not some flea bag. 
PAUL I get into the Sherry tomorrow morning. It's not so far off. I can walk around. I don't think they'll mug me twice in one evening. FLAN and OUISA take's PAUL's by the arm and leads him down the hall into 
THEIR DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM. 
OUISA You'll stay here tonight. 
DINING ROOM/KITCHEN OUISA in the dining room looks at PAUL's back as HE washes dishes at the sink. Suddenly the dining room is flooded with light. FLAN has flicked on the light. 
FLAN He's in. 
OUISA He's in? FLAN parades around the table. 
FLAN He's in for two million. 
OUISA Two million! 
FLAN He says the Cezanne is a great inv1stment. We should get it for six million and sell it to the Tokyo bunch for ten. 
OUISA Happy days! Oh god! PAUL comes into the dining room. 
PAUL Two million dollars? FLAN runs into 
THE LIVING ROOM. FLAN picks up the slide carousel and kisses it. 
FLAN Figure it out. He doesn't have the price of -a dinner but he can cough up two million dollars and the Japs will go ten! PAUL and OUISA come into the living room. 
PAUL Go to ten? Ten million? 
OUISA Break all those dishes! Two million! Go to ten! And we put up nothing? 
PAUL Nothing? 
FLAN Geoffrey sold that Hockney print I know he bought for a hundred bucks fifteen years ago for thirty four thousand dollars. Sotheby took their cut, sure but still--Two million! Wildest dreams. Paul, I should give you a commission. 
PAUL Your kids said you were an art dealer. But you don't have a gallery. I don't understand - 
FLAN People want to sell privately. Not go through a gallery. 
OUISA -Ï¿½ A divorce. Taxes. Publicity. FLAN (holding up a slide) People come to me looking for a certain school of painting. 
OUISA A modern.. Impressionist. Renaissance. 
FLAN But don't want museums to know where it is. 
OUISA Japanese. OUISA, FLAN and PAUL go down the hall to 
FLAN'S OFFICE. FLAN flicks on his computer. 
FLAN I've got Japanese looking for a Cezanne. I have a syndicate that will buy the painting. There is this great second level Cezanne coming up for sale in a very messy divorce. FLAN holds up the slide. 
OUISA Wife doesn't want hubby to know she owns a Cezanne. PAUL looks at the slide. 
FLAN I needed an extra two million. Geoffrey called. Invited him here for dinner. 
OUISA Tonight was a very nervous very casual very big thing. 
PAUL I couldn't tell - 
s PAUL gives the slide very carefully back to FLAN who files it. 
OUISA All the better. 0 FLAN opens a door in the OFFICE. THE OFFICE connects to 
THE MASTER BEDROOM. PAUL follows FLAN and OUISA into their bedroom. 
PAUL I'm glad I helped - 
OUISA You were wonderful! 
PAUL I'm so pleased I was wonderful. All this and a pink shirt. 
OUISA Keep it. Look at the time. 
PAUL It's going to be time for me to get up. 
FLAN Then we'll say our good nights now. 
PAUL Oh Christ. Regretfully. I4l1 tip toe. PAUL and OUISA follow FLAN into 
THE HALL. PAUL goes into their daughter's bedroom. FLAN and OUISA hover in the hall. FLAN takes out his wallet. 
FLAN Take fifty dollars. 
OUISA Give him fifty dollars. 
PAUL Don't need it. 
OUISA Suppose your father's plane is late? 
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR THE CHUMS hang on OUISA's every word. 
OUISA I sat in the kitchen happily doing the cross word puzzle in ink. Everybody does it in ink. I never. met one person who didn't say they did it in ink. 
BACK IN THE KITCHEN OUISA fills in a word on the puzzle. is it in ink? Then looks up. 
OUISA (VO) And I'm doing the puzzle and I see the time and it's nearly seven and Paul had to meet his father and I didn't want him to be late and was he healthy after his stabbing? OUISA puts the puzzle down and goes into 
THE HALL. 
OUISA (VO) The hall is eighteen feet long. OUISA walks down the hall which now seems impossibly long. 
OUISA (VO) I stopped in front of the door. OUISA taps on the door of her daughter's room. 
OUISA Paul? SHE hears - what? - sounds of moaning? 
OUISA Paul?? 
PAUL (MOANING) 
YES YES 
OUISA Are you all right? OUISA opens the door to 
HER DAUGHTER'S BEDROOM. 
SHE turns on the light. SHE screams. A GUY mid 20s, buck naked except for ratty white socks, stands up on the bed. 
HUSTLER What the fuck is going on here. Who the fuck are you?! PAUL, startled,"sits up in bed and pulls on his clothes. OUISA screams. 
OUISA Flan!! 
THE MASTER BEDROOM OUISA shakes FLAN violently. FLAN comes to. 
FLAN What is it?! FLAN AND OUISA step out into 
THE HALL. 
SILENCE. THEY hear their dog bark in 
THE LIVING ROOM. THE HUSTLER, naked but for white socks, wanders around the living room picking up things. THE DOG is barking at HIM. THE HUSTLER turns and smiles at FLAN and OUISA. - 
HUSTLER Hey! How ya doin'? Nice stuff. 
FLAN Oh my God! THE HUSTLER stretches out on the sofa. 
HUSTLER Hey. I got to get some sleep-- FLAN tips the sofa, hurling the HUSTLER onto the floor. THE HUSTLER leaps at FLAN threateningly. 
OUISA Stop it! He might have a gun! 
HUSTLER (laughs) Yeah. I might have a gun. I might have a knife. THE HUSTLER raises his hand threateningly. 
OUISA He has a gun! He has a knife! THE HUSTLER chases OUISA around the room. FLAN chases the HUSTLER. THE DOG chases FLAN. PAUL,dressed, runs in to the living room, carrying THE HUSTLER's clothes which HE hurls down onto the sofa. 
PAUL I can explain. 
OUISA You went out after we went to sleep and picked up this thing? 
FLAN You brought this thing into our house! Thing! Thing! Get out! Get out of my house! FLAN picks up the HUSTLER'S clothes and opens the front door. 
THE HUSTLER Hey! Be careful of the pants! 
FLAN Take your clothes. Go back to sleep in the gutter. FLAN flings the clothes out into 
THE OUTSIDE CORRIDOR. FLAN pushes the elevator button. THE HUSTLER suddenly lunges at FLAN and grabs FLAN by the lapels of his bathrobe. 
HUSTLER Fuck. You! THE HUSTLER throws FLAN back violently, then picks up his clothes. OUISA runs to FLAN. FLAN gasps, catching his breath. THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens.. EDDIE, the elevator man, is startled by the sight. 
W 
OUISA is terrified as PAUL stands at the front door. 
PAUL Please. Don't tell my father. I don't want him to know. I haven't told him. I got. so lonely. I got so afraid. My dad coming. I had the money. I went out after we went to sleep and I brought him back. You had so much. I couldn't be alone. I was so afraid. I am so sorry. 
OUISA Just go. 
EDDIE Is everything all right? 
FLAN Make sure they go out! 
PAUL I can explain!

INT AIRPORT IMMIGRATION GEOFFREY puts the phone down on the security belt. The phone goes through radar. All the while we hear FLAN's voice. The SECURITY PERSON impassively watches the phone on the X-Ray screen. GEOFFREY picks up the phone as it slides off the band.

OUISA We're safe? As FLAN hangs up the phone we hear a car door shut as FLAN and OUISA get in their car. 
EXT THE MILLBROOK GOLF AND TENNIS CLUB DAY THE GROUP FROM THE WEDDING waves goodbye not at the BRIDE and GROOM but at FLAN and OUISA. THE BRIDE and GROOM as a matter of fact are there. 
THE BRIDE And then? 
SANDY And then? 
OUISA That's all we know! And FLAN and OUISA drive out of the parking lot. 
INT/EXT THE CAR TACONIC PARKWAY DAY THE CAMERA pulls back to show FLAN and OUISA driving back down the Taconic Parkway. THEY are more composed now than when THEY left - and even pleased. THE RADIO plays a Bach Cantata: Gloria! THE CAMERA pulls back further to show them entering New York City via the Triborough Bridge. THE CITY looks magnificent for a moment from this vantage. 
EXT EAST 67TH STREET DAY Below us FLAN and,OUISA's car heads for the garage. OUISA's hand suddenly flies out of the car window, waving at a couple in their forties, KITTY AND LARKIN, crossing the street. FLAN honks the horn. THE CAMERA travels down to KITTY and LARKIN as they glare at the car, then smile when THEY see who it is. 
T 
OUISA Do we have a story to tell you! 
KITTY Do we have a story to tell you! 
INT PRECINCT NIGHT We cannot tell where we are yet. But OUISA and FLAN and KITTY and LARKIN lean across a desk and tell a MAN we will learn shortly is a DETECTIVE. 
OUISA Our two and their son are at Harvard together. KITTY and LARKIN are pleased about this. 
INT MORTIMER'S RESTAURANT AFTERNOON THE TWO COUPLES sit a table in this definitive East Side restaurant. 
FLAN Let me tell you our story. 
LARKIN When did your story happen? 
FLAN Last night. We are still zonked. 
KITTY we win. Our story happened Friday night. So we go first. 
LARKIN We're going to be in the movies. 
KITTY We are going to be in the movie of Cats. OUISA puts down her white wine. 
OUISA You tell your story first. 
LARKIN Friday night we were home, the doorbell rang--- 
KITTY I am not impressed but it was the son of - 
INT PRECINCT THE DETECTIVE makes notes. OUISA and FLAN You got it. 
BACK AT MORTIMER'S RESTAURANT 
KITTY The kid was mugged. We had to go out. We left him. He was so charming. His father was taking the red eye. He couldn't get into the Hotel till seven AN. He stayed with us. SHE is very pleased. 
DETECTIVE Sidney Poitier? FLAN and OUISA You got it. 
DETECTIVE Was he? 
OUISA We don't know. 
FLAN We gave him fifty dollars. 
KITTY We gave him twenty five. 
LARKIN 
S HHHH 
OUISA He picked up a hustler. 
FLAN He left. 
KITTY He chased the burglar out of our house. 
OUISA He didn't steal anything. 
LARKIN We looked and looked. 
KITTY Top to bottom. Nothing gone. THE DETECTIVE closes his notebook. 
OUISA Granted this does not seem major now. 
DETECTIVE Look. We're very busy. 
FLAN You can't chuck us out. 
DETECTIVE Come up with charges. Then I'll do something. 
INT THE MORGAN LIBRARY NIGHT FLAN and OUISA have come to a charity do featuring a string quartet playing Schubert Trio in B flat. But FLAN and OUISA are not entranced by the music. THEY stand at the back of the room by the bar telling their story to a GROUP of fascinated FRIENDS (none of whom was at the wedding) as the QUARTET plays. These FRIENDS are all dressed formally but with the look of people who dress this way every night. There-'s always one of these going on and they're always there. 
FLAN Yes, there is another chapter. 
OUISA Our kids came down from Harvard. a Loud groans of protest and disbelief fill the 
KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM DAY Two of FLAN and OUISA'S college aged CHILDREN, WOODY and TESS, and KITTY and LARKIN'S boy, BEN, slump around the room. They are in dismay at OUISA, FLAN, KITTY and LARKIN and their story. 
FLAN --the details he knew--how would he know about the painting? FLAN has taken the Kandinsky off the wall and flipped it around to the wild side. 
FLAN Although I think it's a very fine Kandinsky. FLAN leans the painting against a chair and studies it. 
OUISA And none of you knows this fellow? He has this wild quality--yet, a real elegance and a real concern and a real consideration. TESS looks at the floral arrangement PAUL sent. It's only slightly wilted. 
TESS Well, Mom, you should have let him stay. You should have divorced all your children and just let this dreamboat stay. Plus he sent you flowers. 
FLAN And jam . 
THE KIDS Oooooo. 
OUISA I wish I knew how to get hold of his father. Just to see if there is any truth in it. 
LARKIN Who knows Sidney Poitier so we could just call him up and ask him? 
KITTY I have a friend who does theatrical law. I bet he - 
LARKIN What friend? KITTY (suddenly trapped) Oh, it's nobody. 
LARKIN I want to know. 
KITTY (SCREAMS) Nobody! 
LARKIN (RECONSIDERS) Whatever's going on anywhere, I do not want to know. I don't want to know. I don't want to know. 
KITTY (OVERLAPPING) Nobody. Nobody. Nobody. 
BEN (OVERLAPPING) Dad. Mom. Please. For once. Please? BEN, KITTY, LARKIN scream at each other in anguish. TESS, in a fury, leaves the apartment. FLAN follows HER to 
THE OUTSIDE CORRIDOR. 
FLAN Tess, when you see your little sister, don't tell her that Paul and the hustler used her bed. 
TESS You put him in that bed. I'm not going to get involved with any conspiracy. 
FLAN It's not a conspiracy. It's a family. THE ELEVATOR DOOR opens. TESS and FLAN virtually growl at each other as the door shuts on TESS. 
FLAN sees KITTY, LARKIN and BEN screaming at each other. FLAN sees OUISA, to avoid involvement in the domestic stir, hang the Kandinsky back on the wall. The geometric ordered side. 
DR. FINE Breaking and entering. 
PAUL Breaking and entering? 
DR. FINE You're an imposter. 
PAUL Officer, your honor, your eminence, Dr. Fine cave me the keys to his brownstone. Isn't that so? 
DR. FINE My son doesn't know you. 
PAUL This man gave me the keys to the house. Isn't that so? THE COP puts his gun away. 
POLICEMAN (SCREAMS) Did you give him the key to the house? 
DR. FINE Yes, but under false pretenses. This fucking black kid crack addict comes into my office 
LYING - 
PAUL (cool and forgiving) I have taken this much brandy but can pour the rest back into the bottle. And I've used electricity listening to the music, but I think you'll find that nothing's taken from the house. PAUL takes off the silk robe and neatly places it on the table. 
DR. FINE I want you to arrest this fraud. PAUL puts on his jacket and leaves the house. 
DR. FINE Stop him! THE POLICEMAN walks away. 
COLLEGE DORM ROOM DOUG continues his tirade. 
DOUG A cretin! A creep! No wonder mother left you! 
DOUG flings the phone against the wall. 
DR. FINE'S OFFICE FLAN and OUISA, KITTY and LARKIN look at DR. FINE sympathetically. 
DR. FINE Two sides. Every story. But THE TWO COUPLES are also embarrassed. 
BACK TO THE MORGAN LIBRARY PEOPLE from the back row of the concert turn away from the music and listen to OUISA and FLAN. 
OUISA We went down to the Strand - 
FLAN Five Sherlock Holmeses- 
0 EXT THE STRAND BOOKSTORE 12th STREET AND BROADWAY DAY The TWO COUPLES AND DR. FINE, go into 
THE STRAND BOOKSTORE. which advertises itself as possessing Eight miles of books and that seems an understatement. THE CAMERA rushes past rows of books. And then suddenly stops. 
OUISA I found it! OUISA'S HAND reaches up and brings down. 
CU A COPY OF SIDNEY POITIER'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY: "This Life" OUISA reads from the Poitier autobiography. THE OTHERS are enrapt.. 
OUISA "Back in New York with Juanita and the children, I began to become aware that our marriage, while working on some levels, was falling apart in other fundamental areas." FLAN takes the book. 
FLAN There's a picture of him and his four- daughters. No sons. Four daughters. 
BACK TO THE MORGAN LIBRARY 
FLAN The book's called This Life. 
A CONCERT-GOER No sons? 
OUISA No sons! 
THE STRAND BOOKSTORE 
KITTY Oh dear. 
OUISA This kid bulldozing his way into our lives. 
LA.RKIN is We let him in our lives. I run a foundation. You're a dealer. You're a doctor. You'd think we'd be satisfied with our achievements. 
TNT THE GOTHAM RESTAURANT DAY THE FIVE of THEM have gone down the street fram the Strand to this swell restaurant. 
FLAN Agatha Christie would ask what do we all have in common? 
OUISA It seems the common thread linking us all is an overwhelming need to be in the movie of Cats. 
KITTY Our kids. Struggling through their lives. 
LARKIN I don't want to know anything about the spillover of their lives. 
OUISA 
All we have in common is our children went to boarding school together. FLAN (to Dr. Fine) How come we never met? 
TESS You went to Cats. You said it was an all time low in a lifetime of theater going. OUISA considers. 
OUISA Film is a different medium. 
TESS You said Aeschylus did not invent theater to have it end up a bunch of chorus kids wondering which of them will go to Kitty Kat Heaven. 
OUISA I don't remember saying that. 
FLAN No, I think that was Starlight Express - 
TESS Well, maybe he'll make a movie of Starlight Express and you can all be on roller skates! THE KIDS stand up. 
DOUG This is so humiliating. 
BEN This is so pathetic. 
TESS This is so racist. 
OUISA This is not racist! THE KIDS stride out of the DINING HALL into 
THE CORRIDOR. THEIR PARENTS run ahead trying to circle them. 
DOUG How can I get in touch with anybody in high school? I've outgrown them. 
KITTY Now can you outgrow them? You graduated a year ago! THE PARENTS stop in front of 
THE MAIN ENTRANCE blocking TESS and DOUG and BEN's escape. OUISA takes a red book out of her bag and brandishes at THEM. 
OUISA Here is a copy of your yearbook. I want you to get the phone numbers of everybody in your class. You all went to the same boarding school. 
DR. FINE You can charge it to my phone. 
OUISA Call everyone in your class and ask them if they know-- THE THREE KIDS try to break through the blockade. 
DOUG Never! 
TESS This is the KGB. 
DR. FINE You're on the phone all the time. Now I ask you to make calls all over the country and you become reticent. 
TESS This is the entire McCarthy period. WOODY saunters up to his PARENTS. HE is very cool. FLAN and OUISA smile at his sweet attitude. 
WOODY I just want to get one thing straight. 
FLAN Finally, we hear from the peanut gallery. And WOODY screams at THEM in rage, his voice echoing, mindless of the STUDENTS who freeze in the background as you would at a traffic accident. 
WOODY You gave him my pink shirt? You gave a complete stranger my pink shirt? That pink shirt was a Christmas present from you. I treasured that shirt. I loved that shirt. My collar size has grown a full size from weight lifting. And you saw my arms had grown, you saw my neck had grown. And you bought me that shirt for my new body. I loved that shirt. The first shirt for my new body. And you gave that shirt away. I can't believe it. I hate this life. I hate you. 
EXT ELIOT HOUSE WOODY's wrath grows and grows and drives OUISA and FLAN, indeed all the PARENTS, out of the serene, venerable Harvard building onto the street. PASSERSBY stop and gape. WOODY doesn't care. 
DOUG You never do anything for me. 
TESS You've never done anything but tried to block me. 
BEN I'm only this pathetic extension of your eighth rate personality. 
DOUG Social Darwinism pushed beyond all limits. 
WOODY You gave away my pink shirt? 
TESS You want me to be everything you weren't. 
DOUG You said drugs and looked at me. THE PARENTS go down the street, speechless, defeated. 
CUT TO PAGES of a Yearbook turning. The pages stop. 
TESS (VO) Trent Conway. - 
EXT THE BANKS OF THE CHARLES RIVER DAY THE FOUR KIDS look through their high school yearbook. TESS spots a face. THEY all consider. 
THE KIDS Trent Conway. 
CU 
TRENT CONWAY'S YEARBOOK PICTURE TRENT is weasel faced. Very hard to read. Not quite looking into the yearbook photographer's camera. 
TESS Trent Conway. 
DOUG Look at those beady eyes staring out at me. 
BEN Trent Conway. 
TRENT I feel like Scheherazade! TRENT embraces PAUL with fierce tenderness. Maybe TRENT had one happy day and this is it. 
TRENT I don't want you to leave me, Paul. I'll go through my address book and tell you about family after family. You 111 never not fit in again. we'll give you a new ideas it.y. I'll make you the most eagerly sought after young man in the East. And then I'I1 come into one of these homes one day---and you'll be there and I'll be presented to you. And I'll pretend to meet you for the first time and our friendship will be witnessed by my friends, our parents' friends. If it all happens under their noses, they can't judge me. They can't disparage you. I'll make you a guest in their houses. Ask me another name. I'd like to try for the shirt. PAUL kisses TRENT. 
PAUL That's enough for today. PAUL takes his shoes and the address book and goes. 
KITTRED4 E' S LIVING ROOM 40 OUISA brushes TESS's hair as THEY listen. 
TRENT'S TAPED VOICE Paul stayed with me for three months. 
TRENT CONWAY'S APARTMENT PAUL leans against the white wall. PAUL frowns, then smiles. All ready PAUL has begun to change from a street kid to someone quite preppy - very Ralph Lauren. Only on the surface. HE's still learning. 
TRENT This is the way you must speak. Hear my accent. Hear my voice. Never say you're going horse back riding. You say You're going Riding. And don't say couch. Say sofa. And you say Bodd-ill. It's bottle. Say bottle of beer. 
PAUL Bodd-ill a bee-ya. 
TRENT Bottle of beer. 
PAUL 
(SERIOUS) Bodd-ill a bee-ya. 
(FLIRTATIOUS) Bodd-ill a bee-ya. 
(SUSPICIOUS) Bodd-ill a bee-ya. 
(ELATED) Bottle of beer. TRENT claps. PAUL bows to TRENT. TRENT'S face is transfigured with joy. 
COMPUTER ROOM TRENT smiles at TESS but the smile is one of tight lipped stoicism. 
TRENT We went through the address book letter by letter. Paul vanished by the L's. He took the address book with him. Well, he's already been in all your houses. Maybe I will meet him again. I sure would like to. TRENT stands up signalling an end to the conversation. HE turns off his computers. 
TESS His past? His real name? 
TRENT I don't know anything about him. It was a rainy night in Boston. He was in a doorway. That's all. 
TESS He took stuff from you? 
TRENT Besides the address book? He took my stereo and sport jacket and my word processor and my laser printer. And my skis. And my TV. 
TESS Will you press charges? 
TRENT No. 
TESS It's a felony. 
TRENT Why do they want to find him? 
TES S They say to help him. If there's a crime, the cops will get involved. 
TRENT Look, we must keep in touch. We were friends for a brief bit in school. I mean we were really good friends. 
KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM 
TESS'S TAPED VOICE won't you press charges? 
TRENT'S TAPED VOICE Please. TESS leans forward-and snaps off the tape recorder. OUISA is amazed. 
INT LINCOLN CENTER METROPOLITAN OPERA NIGHT FLAN and OUISA have brought their FRIENDS up to date. 
OUISA Paul learned all that in three months! 
OPERAGOER Three months? 
FLAN Three months! The chimes ring, signalling the start of the opera. 
OUISA who would have thought it? Trent Conway, the Henry Higgins of our time. THE GROUP laughs and finishes their drinks as THE USHER unlocks the door to 
THE OPERA BOX. THE GROUP proceeds in, deciding who'll sit where in the box and checking their programs. OUISA looks into the vastness of the Metropolitan Opera House. THe chandeliers are rising into the ceiling. 
OPERAGOER #1 Quick - what the hell is the story of this opera? FLAN adjusts his opera glasses. a 
OPERAGOER #2 Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. OUISA is distracted. 
OUISA Paul must have looked at all those names and said I am Columbus. I am Magellan. I will sail into this new world. The camera comes in on OUISA as she remembers 
THE KITTREDGE LIVING ROOM. TESS laughs. OUISA laughs. It's a nice moment between these two. 
OUISA I read somewhere that everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people. Six degrees of separation. Between us and everybody else on this planet. The President of the United States. A. gondolier in Venice. Fill in the names. I find that A.] tremendously comforting that we're so close and B.] like Chinese water torture that we're so close. Because you have to find the right six people to make the connection. It's not just big names. It's anyone. A native in a rain forest. A Tierra del Fuegan. An Eskimo. I am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people. It's a profound thought. How Paul found us. How to find the man whose son he pretends to be. Or perhaps j& his son, although I doubt it. How every person is a new door, opening up into other worlds. Six degrees of separation between me and everyone else on this planet. But to find the right six people. TESS kisses HER MOTHER. OUISA puts out the light and THEY leave the room. 
MUSIC THE ACT ONE MUSIC OF PUCCINI'S TOSCA suddenly swells up and 
DOORMAN Your son! I know all about your son. 
FLAN What about my son? 
DOORMAN Not the little shit who lives here. The other son. The secret son. The negro son you deny. 
FLAN The negro son? 
DOORMAN The black son you make live in Central Park while you're gallivanting around Rome. The DOORMAN spits at FLAN again. 
SOHO LOFT THE JAPANESE HOSTESS is interested. 
THE JAPANESE HOSTESS You have a black son? 
FLAN No! The cops brought this young girl to us! 
OUISA The cops called us up and we went down to the precinct again! 
INT PRECINCT DAY THE DETECTIVE sits on the edge of his desk. OUISA and FLAN sit in chairs in the small office, looking on uncomfortably. The emotion in the shabby room is too big for the size of it. THEY watch a young woman named ELIZABETH,in her mid-20s, seated behind the DETECTIVE'S desk. 
ELIZABETH (in a rage) I want him dead. That's all I want. 
SOHO LOFT OUISA leans forward at the dinner table. 
OUISA The next chapter. THE PARTY is silenced. 
THE PRECINCT 
ELIZABETH My boy friend and I took a picnic into the park 
EXT CENTRAL PARK DAY RICK, ELIZABETH and PAUL sprawl out on the grass in the sun, under the statue of the Alaskan husky, the remains of a picnic around them. Bongo Drums play in the distance. 
ELIZABETH (VO) and we met this guy and started singing and talking. RICK, a nice young guy in his mid-twenties, plays his guitar energetically, the THREE of them having a great time singing a cheery old rock song. PAUL is wearing the pink shirt and the khakis but looks pretty seedy. HE eats hungrily. 
PAUL I was hallucinating from not eating- 
ELIZABETH If I told people back home that New York had trees and picnics, they'd swear I was lying. I love New York so much. Look at it! I can't get over it. 
RICK We're here from Utah. 
PAUL Do they have any black people in Utah? 
RICK Maybe two. 
ELIZABETH I saw them once. Two black people. 
RICK Yes, the Mormons brought in two. THEY all laugh, enjoying each other, the day, the meeting. 
ELIZABETH We came here to be actors. 
RICK She won the all-state competition for comedy and drama. 
PAUL My gosh! ELIZABETH stands up and declaims. 
ELIZABETH "The quality of mercy is not strained. It droppeth like the gentle rain from heaven.." SHE's not bad. But then SHE giggles and the Shakespearean effect crumbles. 
RICK And we study and we wait tables. 
ELIZABETH Because you have to have technique. ELIZABETH and RICK are very earnest. 
PAUL Like the painters. Cezanne looked for the rules behind the spontaneity of Impressionism. 
RICK Cez - That's a painter? 
ELIZABETH We don't know anything about painting. 
PAUL My dad loves painting. He has a Kandinsky but he loves Cezanne the most. He lives up there. 
RICK What? 
PAUL points up at 910 FIFTH, the home of the Kittredge's. 
PAUL He lives up there. Count six windows over. John Flanders Kittredge. His chums-call him Flan. I was the child of Flan's hippie days. His radical days. He went down South as a freedom marcher, to register black voters - his friends were killed. Met my mother. Registered her and married her in a fit of sentimental righteousness and knocked her up with me and came back here and abandoned her. Went to Harvard. He's now a fancy art dealer. Lives up there. Count six windows over. Won't see me. The new wife--the white wife-- The Louisa Kittredge Call Me Ouisa wife - the mother of the new children wife-- 
RICK Your brothers and sisters? 
PAUL (BITTER) They go to Andover and Exeter and Harvard and Yale. The awful thing is my father started out good. My mother says there is a good man inside s J. Flanders Kittredge. 
ELIZABETH He'll see you if he is that good. He can't forget you entirely. 
PAUL I call him. He hangs up. 
RICK I swear nothing like this ever happened in Utah. 
THE RAINBOW ROOM At first PEOPLE don't notice RICK and PAUL dancing. Then PEOPLE do notice. 
RICK (VO) And, I'll tell you, nothing like that must have ever happened at the Rainbow Room because they asked us to leave. It was so funny. PAUL spins RICK round and round and the CAMERA spins with 
THEM. 
RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT 
RICK You'll love the place. It's up so high. 
THE RAINBOW ROOM THE CAMERA spins around the panoramic view sixty-five floors and then spins out of the windows down onto 
EXT THE ICE RINK ROCKEFELLER CENTER NIGHT THE CAMERA focusses in on a COUPLE spinning in the middle of the ice. RICK and PAUL, hysterical with laughter, cut through Rockefeller Center and then come to Fifth Avenue where A HANSOM CARRIAGE waits. THE DRIVER tips his hat to these customers. PAUL jumps into 
THE HANSOM CARRIAGE. 
RICK We don't have any money - 
PAUL Amigo! When will you learn! Money is one commodity you can always get. THE HANSOM CARRIAGE proceeds up to Central Park. RICK leans forward looking out the isinglass windows. 
RICK I'm going to have to explain to Elizabeth about the money and calm her. She gets so nervous 
ABOUT- (PAUL draws a circle on RICK's back.) Hey, stop that. Paul. Come on. 
PAUL I was wondering if I could fuck you. RICK laughs. Then sees PAUL is serious. 
RICK I don't do things like that. 
PAUL That's what makes it so nice. You don't. 
RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT RICK reaches over and turns off the light by the bedside. Downstairs we hear the throb beginning of the roller disco. ELIZABETH looks at him coldly. 
RICK - and he did and it was fantastic. 
THE HANSOM CARRIAGE Time has passed. PAUL kisses an amazed, mussed RICK on the mouth and jumps out of the CARRIAGE and goes off into the dark. 
EXT CENTRAL PARK THE DRIVER stands up seeing PAUL run out. RICK runs out of the CARRIAGE after PAUL. THE DRIVER chases them. 
CU RICK lost in the nighttime park. RICK looks up and sees the STATUE OF THE HUSKY. 
RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT RICK paces back and forth. 
RICK Didn't we come here for experience? Right? We can use this. Right? ELIZABETH lies on her stomach on the bed away from him. 
THE PRECINCT ELIZABETH rolls a pencil back and forth on the desk. FLAN and OUISA watch sympathetically. 
ELIZABETH He rambled on for hours. His own father warned me Rick was a fool and I looked at Rick and knew his father was right. 
RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT RICK paces back and forth in a rage, pulling at his tux. 
RICK - - My father is not right! I can't have him be right. I wanted experience. We came here for experience. What's so wrong with that? Right? ELIZABETH is repelled by him. 
ELIZABETH Don't touch me! 
THE PRECINCT ELIZABETH rubs her hands over her face as if trying to get the memory away. OUISA looks at FLAN and THE DETECTIVE. 
ELIZABETH He went on for a long time trying to get me just to look at him. I couldn't even do that. 
RICK AND ELIZABETH'S TENEMENT 
RICK But I didn't come here to do this or lose that or be this or do this to you. Not to you. Look at me? Elizabeth! What did I let him do to me? 
ELIZABETH Nobody did this but you. 
BACK IN ORSO'S RESTAURANT 
FLAN Now the amazing part is 
OUISA talk about six degrees 
FLAN We were in the roller disco that night! ANDREW and JEANNIE's jaws drop. 
OUISA Yes! There we were roller skating for heart disease or cancer - 
FLAN It was illiteracy. 
INT ROLLER DISCO NIGHT MIDDLE AGED PEOPLE all dolled up roll skate around and around trying to keep their balance to 40s swing music. Among the SKATERS we spot FLAN and OUISA at this ROLLER DISCO BENEFIT skating round and round breathlessly going faster and faster, laughing and laughing. Lights flash and whirl. 
ORSO'S RESTAURANT 
DUISA Ahh, you've become an aesthete. 
PAUL Are you laughing at me? 
OUISA No. I read them too. 
PAUL I read The Agony and the Ecstasy by Irving Stone about Michelangelo painting the Sistine Chapel. 
DUISA You're ahead of me there. 
PAUL Have you seen the Sistine Chapel? 
OUISA Oh yes. Even gone to the top of it in a rickety elevator to watch the men clean it. 
PAUL You've been to the top of the Sistine Chapel? PAUL leans into the phone, amazed, as the screen floods with the brightly colored ceiling of the 
INT SISTINE CHAPEL OUISA and FLAN stand on the top of a rickety platform. THE WORIOCkN slaps it. 
OUISA (VO) Absolutely. Stood right under the hand of God touching the hand of man. 
THE WORKMAN Hit it. Hit it. It's only a fresco. OUISA looks up at the hand of God. SHE laughs and slaps the hand of God. PAUL smiles in wonderment as the SCREEN fills with color. But then WE're out of his imagination and see the squalid surroundings of his phone booth. 
PAUL You slapped God's hand! 
KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM 
OUISA I slapped God's clean hand. And you know what they clean it with? All this technology? Q-tips and water. PAUL is thrilled by this bit of knowledge. 
PAUL No! 
OUISA Clean away the years of grime and soot and paint ovens. Q-tips and water changing the history of Western art. Vivid colors. 
PAUL Take me to see it? 
OUISA Take you to see it? Paul, they think you might have murdered someone! You stole money! 0 FLAN appears, needing help with his studs. 
FLAN Honey, could you give me a hand with-- OUISA (mouths to Flan) It's Paul. FLAN goes to the other phone. 
FLAN I'll call that detective. The other phone line rings. FLAN picks it up. 
INT HARVARD DORM ROOM 
TESS Dad! We were cut off. I'm getting marr - 
FLAN (VO) Darling, could you call back - 
TESS I'm getting married and going to Afghanistan - 
BACK IN THE KITTRIDGE'S LIVING ROOM 
FLAN We cannot talk about this now - 
HARVARD DORM ROOM 
TESS I'm going to ruin my life and get married and throw away everything you want me to be because it's the only way to hurt you! TESS hangs up. ANOTHER PHONE is picked up. It is at 
THE PRECINCT. THE DETECTIVE doesn't even get to say "Hello". FLAN (on the phone) I've got that kid on the line. 
DETECTIVE Find out where he is. 
KITTREDGE'S LIVING ROOM FLAN (mouths to Ouisa) Find out where he is 
PAUL Who's there? 
OUISA Look, why don't you cone here. Where are you? PAUL, pressed in the battered phone booth, doesn't want to be in this cold street with its brightly lit squalor. HE wants to be at OUISA's, but his fear wins out. 
PAUL I come there and you'll have the cops waiting. 
OUISA You have to trust us. 
PAUL Why? 
OUISA Because - we like you. 
FLAN (mouths) Where is he? PAUL, straining to hear, gets very paranoid. 
PAUL Who's there? 
IT'S - I'm not here. It's Flan. FLAN groans impatiently. PAUL brightens. THE OPERATOR makes noises. PAUL drops a coin in the box. 
PAUL Are you in tonight? I could come and make a feast for you. 
OUISA Have some flexibility! You're stupid not to recognize what you could be. 
PAUL What could I be? 
OUISA So much. 
PAUL With you behind me? 
OUISA Perhaps. You liked that night? I've thought since that you spent all your time laughing at us. 
PAUL No. 
SHE walks down the HALL. 
DUISA That you had brought that awful hustling thing back to show us your contempt - 
PAUL I was so happy. I wanted to add sex to it. Don't you do that? OUISA looks into the MASTER BEDROOM and goes in. 
DUISA (PAUSE) No. 
PAUL I'll tell you my name. 
OUISA Please? 
PAUL It's Paul Poitier-Kittredge. It's a hyphenated name. SHE sits on her bed. 
OUISA Paul? You need help. Go to the police. Turn yourself in. You'll be over it all the sooner. You can start. 
PAUL Start what? 
OUISA Your life. 
PAUL Will you help me? OUISA stands up. 
OUISA I will help you. But you have to go to the police and go to jail and - 
PAUL Will you send me books and polaroids of you and cassettes? And letters? 
OUISA Yes. OUISA walks rapidly down the HALL. 
PAUL Will you visit me? 
OUISA I will visit you. 
PAUL And when you do, you'll wear your best clothes and knock em dead? SHE's in the LIVING ROOM. 
OUISA I'll knock em dead. But you've got to be careful in prison. You have to use condoms. 
PAUL I won't have sex in prison. I only have sex when I'm happy. 
OUISA Go to the police. 
PAUL Will you take me? 
OUISA I'll give you the name of-the detective to see- 
PAUL I'll be treated with care if you take me to the police. If they don't know you're special, they kill you. 
OUISA I don't think they kill you. PAUL puts the phone receiver over his head in a sudden gesture of fear. Then HE returns the receiver to his ear. 
PAUL Mrs. Louisa Kittredge, I am black. 
PAUSE. 
OUISA I will deliver you to them with kindness and affection. 
PAUL And I'll plead guilty and go to prison and serve a few months. 
OUISA A few months tops. 
PAUL Then I'll come out and work for you and learn - 
OUISA We'll work that out. 
PAUL I want to know now. 
OUISA Yes. You'll work for us. 
PAUL Learn all the trade. Not just the grotty part. 
OUISA Top to bottom. 
OUISA We can skip the shmoozing. Pick the boy up, take him to the police and be at Sotheby's before eight. 
INT A FORMAL DINING ROOM Of all the PARTIES we've been to, this is the most luxurious of all, given by one of New York's legendary hostess's, a glamorous woman who must be in her late 80s, MRS. BANNISTER. OUISA and FLAN are here. This dinner is really a state occasion in honor of that United Nations type at MRS. BANNISTER'S right. But FLAN and OUISA have captured the table. 
OUISA t The story ended there... 
FLAN It did not! Clearly OUISA is as disturbed by the telling of the events as FLAN is energized. 
OUISA There are so many other people here tonight. We didn't mean to take up so much MRS. BANNISTER slams her napkin down. 
MRS. BANNISTER No! It's my supper and I command you to sing! 
FLAN We called our new best friend, the detective. 
OUISA We told them Paul was at the Waverly theater. FLAN (to his dinner partner) Sixth Avenue and Third Street. The lobby. 
OUISA But we had promised Paul that we would bring him to the police. We told the police he was special. 
FLAN Well, Ouisa did. 
OUISA The detective said he'd honor our promise. 
FLAN We skipped the cocktails 
OUISA But we didn't count on 
EXT TRAFFIC ON FIFTH AVENUE OUISA and FLAN in dinner clothes are stuck in a traffic jam. 
OUISA (VO) Traffic traffic traffic FLAN gets out of the car and looks ahead in this din of honking horns. 
EXT WAVERLY MOVIE THEATER, GREENWICH VILLAGE NIGHT FLAN and OUISA speed up Sixth Avenue and double park in front of the Waverly Movie Theater. Two Cop cars are there. Red lights spinning. PEOPLE gape on the street. 
THEY see PAUL being dragged into one of the two Cop cars, t kicking and screaming. THE COPS throw PAUL into the back seat. FLAN tries to talk to one of the POLICE while OUISA runs up to the Cop car window. PAUL, being handcuffed, looks at OUISA. HE smiles as if HE's bumped into DUISA at a cocktail party. 
PAUL The Kandinsky is painted on both sides. DUISA is startled. THE COP slams the car door on PAUL. 
OUISA Paul? Officer? Let me go with you - I promised I'd take him! 
OFFICER Lady. Out of the way -- FLAN takes OUISA's-arm. 
OUISA We have to do soaething! 
FLAN 
Let's just get the hell out of here. THE COP CAR pulls away, sirens blaring. PAUL turns and looks at OUISA. Betrayal. 
BACK IN THE FORMAL DINING ROOM 
MRS. BANNISTER There's nothing more you can do - 
FLAN What could we do? We tried. 
OUISA went to the precinct. 
INT THE PRECINCT DAY DUISA hands the detective's card to the DESK CLERK. 
CLERK He's transferred. 
OUISA Since yesterday? He's been handling this 
CLERK He's transferred - 
OUISA This is about an arrest made yesterday at the Waverly Movie theater - THE CLERK checks the records. 
CLERK This precinct didn't do any business at the Waverly Theater. 
OUISA I didn't imagine it - 
CLERK I'm not saying you did. 
OUISA Could you find out which precinct - THE CLERK looks through the book. 
CLERK The name? 
OUISA Poitier. He's a young black man. Or maybe Kittredge. I don't know the exact name - 
CLERK Are you family? 
OUISA Not exactly. But the detective promised me yesterday that I could go with the young man when he was arraigned to let them know he was special. 
CLERK We have no record of it. Some other precinct must have made the arrest. It sounds like your special friend was wanted for something else.

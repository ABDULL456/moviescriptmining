"LITTLE NICKY" -- by Tim Herlihy, Adam Sandler & Steven Brill 
FADE IN: 
EXT. SUBURBIA - NIGHT 
A beautiful late summer night.  Crickets chirping, sprinklers sprinkling. 
We PAN across one particular lawn, up one particular tree, where we see THE PEEPER (Jon Lovitz) sitting on a limb.  He has a bottle of wine, some sandwiches, a Walkman.  Suddenly the lights turn on. 
PEEPER (whispering) Showtime! 
We see a young mother walk into the room outside the Peeper's window.  She is wearing business attire. 
PEEPER (CONT'D) Rough day at the office Mrs. Dunleavy? (takes bite of sandwich) Well you'll feel better once you slip off those work clothes and get into some sweats. 
The mother sits on the bed and pulls off her shoes, rubbing her feet. 
PEEPER (CONT'D) Oh my G-D, yes!  I wish you would let me rub those feet.  Of course I wouldn't use my hands.  Heh heh heh heh... 
He sips some wine. 
The mother starts to unbutton her blouse.  She takes it off, revealing a nice bra. 
PEEPER (CONT'D) Looks like Victoria just told me her secret. 
The peeper frantically writes in a dirty notebook.  Mouthing the words as he goes. 
PEEPER (CONT'D) Thursday the ninth, eight-thirty p.m., first brassiere sighting... (stops writing) I will pleasure myself to this image for months.  MONTHS I TELL YOU! 
The mother starts to unbutton her pants.  Her young son walks in wearing a scouts uniform. 
PEEPER (CONT'D) Young Scottie Dunleavy.  What unfortunate timing.  You mother was just getting comfy. 
The son talks to his mother excitedly. 
PEEPER (CONT'D) Yes, yes, I'm sure you tied many great knots today or whatever.  Now get out. 
The son, not going anywhere, sits in a chair. 
PEEPER (CONT'D) Now what.  This simply won't do. 
The peeper takes out a cell phone and dials.  The son answers. 
SCOTTIE Hello? 
PEEPER Hello, Scottie.  Why don't you go downstairs like a good boy and let your mother freshen up. 
SCOTTIE Who is this? 
PEEPER Just a little birdie.  A birdie who wants to see if your mother's panties match her bra. 
MOTHER Oh my G-D Scottie.  Is there a man up our tree? 
The peeper gets nervous. 
PEEPER Tell her no.  Tell her it's just a big bird. 
The peeper starts flapping his arms and making bird noises. We SEE Scottie with his sling shot.  The mother nods yes.  He shoots it.  It hits the peeper square in the head.  He falls to the ground with a thud. 
PEEPER (CONT'D) Mrs. Dunleavy, please come help me.  And wear your bikini. 
The peeper looks up.  He sees Scottie pushing a television out the window.  It lands on top of the peeper.  He's dead. 
HARD CUT: 
INT. HOLE - DAY 
The peeper is zooming down a hole, walls of dirt racing by on all sides. 
The peeper is falling down, down, down.  The whole way screaming like a five-year old girl. 
PEEPER'S POV 
We see the tunnel turn into more of a slide now and the peeper races towards the opening which is lit by fire.  He SCREAMS. 
EXT. FIRE GATES OF HELL 
NICKY No.  This can't be happening. 
DAD Son, just do your best. 
Nicky looks teary eyed.  The moment is broken by the Monster, who runs in and pushes Nicky through the fire. 
Nicky goes through the solid fire wall.  PAUSE.  The Monster taps his own wrist and looks at Dad as if to say, "gotta get a move on." 
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY 
A SIGN: 42ND ST. GRAND CENTRAL 
PAN DOWN to the darkened bowels of the old station, between two tracks, to a putrid puddle.  Nicky breaks through the surface, sputtering.  We hear a rumbling in the near distance. 
NICKY Okay. Earth.  The Blue Marble.  This doesn't look too bad. 
Nicky sees a fast approaching light, furrows his brow and WHAMMM! 
EXT. GATES OF HELL - MOMENTS LATER 
Nicky comes shooting through the solid fire wall and lands in the coal pit.  His Dad limps back to him. 
JIMMY THE DEMON You were gone ten seconds.  What happened? 
NICKY I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal. 
DAD That's a train, son.  Don't stand in front of them. 
NICKY Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one. 
DAD Please, Nicky, get back up there. (his ear falls off) Try to hurry. 
Nicky climbs up and heads back toward the fire wall. 
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY 
Nicky makes it back through the hole.  Looks both ways and hops out of the hole.  He carefully crosses the tracks and is stopped by the sight of a bulldog, BEEFY, on the other side. In his mouth is one of those signs car service drivers use to identify their passengers at the airport.  On the sign is scrawled "NICKY." 
Nicky and Beefy stare at each other a beat. 
NICKY I'm Nicky. 
Beefy drops the sign from his mouth. 
BEEFY (voice of Sandy Wernick) Hey, terrific!!  Now get off the track and come with me, shitstains. 
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - DAY 
The throng of commuters making their way through the terminal are giving a wide berth to the filthy man who's looking around suspiciously, talking to the dog. 
BEEFY My name's Beefy.  I'm an old friend of your father's.  He's asked me to help you out. 
NICKY I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy. 
BEEFY It's not gonna be easy.  Your brothers can possess people.  So they probably won't look like themselves.  You have to be suspicious of everyone. 
Nicky looks at Beefy warily for a beat. 
NICKY Okay, "bro," this jig is up... (pulling out the flask) Just get in the bottle.  Just slide right on in there. 
BEEFY It's not me, moron. 
NICKY Oh.  Sorry. 
EXT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY 
A BLIND PREACHER rants outside the entrance.  People put money in his pot. 
PREACHER Oh how the Lord loves you.  All his children. (passerby puts in money) He thanks you for your kindness. (another woman puts in money) God bless, Ma'am.  The Lord loves you... The Lord loves you... 
We see Nicky and Beefy walk up from behind.  The PREACHER sniffs. 
PREACHER (CONT'D) The Lord does not love you.  I sense...pure evil. (thrusts his cross in Nicky's face) You make the Lord very nervous. (feeling hot) I'm burning...ahhh. (running away) The Devil walks among us! 
He runs off screaming, wildly bumping into people. 
PREACHER (CONT'D) Oh Lord, save us from Hell's beast! 
BEEFY So I found this other joint for you. But you're gonna have a roommate. 
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT 
A scruffy, thirtyish buy, TODD (Allen Covert), is on the phone in his small, bohemian apartment in the Village. 
TODD (on phone) I know exactly how you feel... The night Reagan was elected, I said to my mother, "Is this man going to blow up the world, Mommy?"  Then we both cried for like an hour. (knock at the door) Somebody's here.  Call you later. 
Todd gets up and opens the door.  It's Nicky, with Beefy by his side.  Nicky is nervous, and his speech sounds practiced. 
NICKY Hello, friend, my name is Nicky.  I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice.  Would it be possible for me to fill the slot? 
TODD Uh, don't you want to know what the rent is? 
Nicky looks down at Beefy.  Beefy looks up at Nicky.  Both nod imperceptibly. 
NICKY Yes.  What is rent? 
TODD Eight-hundred, split down the middle. Tuesdays and Thursdays I rehearse with my scene partner so the living room will be off limits. 
NICKY Off limits. 
TODD Right.  And as far as household items: we can share the soap, but we'll split the cost 60/40. Cause the person who physically goes out and buys the soap shouldn't have to pay as much as the other guy. (looks at Nicky) Aren't you boiling in that outfit? 
NICKY No. 
TODD It's like eighty degrees in this hallway.  You from the South? 
NICKY Yeah.  The deep South. 
Nicky laughs a little too hard. 
TODD Why is that funny? 
NICKY I don't know. 
TODD And sorry, man, but no dogs allowed. 
Todd turns and goes into the apartment. 
BEEFY You'll be alright.  Go on.  Big day tomorrow.  Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about. 
NICKY Got ya. (to Todd) Is it okay if I do the sleep thing? 
TODD Yeah, your bedroom is right over there. 
The door closes.  Beefy looks down at the welcome mat.  It reads: I "heart" METHOD ACTING.  Beefy raises his leg over it. 
INT. NICKY'S ROOM 
Nicky is sleeping on top of the hissing radiator, fully clothed.  When he inhales through his nose, we hear that familiar snoring/snorting sound.  But when he exhales, we hear disturbing "speaking-in-tongues", Exorcist-style voices. 
SLOW PAN across the room to the doorway where Todd stands, looking concerned. 
EXT. CATHEDRAL - MORNING 
We HEAR the bells toll.  We see the beautiful exterior of a large church. 
INT. CATHEDRAL 
CLOSE ON an ELDERLY, kind looking CARDINAL.  He ascends the steps to the pulpit and looks out on his large congregation. We see that TV cameras are covering the SUNDAY service.  He gins his homily. 
CARDINAL In today's gospel, the Lord tells us who we are to live if we wish to attain the splendor of Heaven... or something like that.  Jesus sure says a lot of stuff in the Bible.  Moses this.  Moses that. Abraham hit me with a whiffle ball bat. 
The crowd stares dumbfounded.  We see that the Cardinal is standing on a steaming hot pizza which is still in the box with the top open. 
CARDINAL (CONT'D) Yep, the Lord sure did say a bunch of hibbity-jibbity.  But has he ever really done anything for us?  Has he ever put a Jaguar XJR in my driveway?  Has he ever given any of my enemies the herpes?  No. He hasn't done a damn thing for any of us. 
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stands up. 
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN The Lord gave my son the strength to get off drugs. 
CARDINAL Ma'am, I know your son, and believe me, he was better off on drugs.  He's a bore.  At least when he was smoking hashish, he made me laugh occasionally. 
A YOUNG MAN and his PREGNANT WIFE stand up. 
YOUNG MAN After we tried for many years, the Lord finally helped my wife conceive a baby. 
nicky walks up to a homeless man.  He thrusts the bottle in his face.  To Nicky's surprise, the homeless man gladly takes it and drinks.  Nothing happens.  Nicky is baffled.  He tries to take the flask back, but the man won't let go.  Finally he grabs it away from him.  The man starts throwing garbage at Nicky as he walks away. 
INT. CENTRAL PARK ZOO - DAY 
Beefy is looking around for Nicky.  He spots him - inside the polar bear cage.  Nicky approaches the bear holding the flask. 
INT. HELL - MOMENTS LATER 
Nicky shoots through the firewall, having been killed again. The Gatekeeper is wearing tassels on his boobs. 
GATEKEEPER Bus? 
NICKY Beast. 
The Monster laughs. 
GATEKEEPER (to Monster) You like that?  You think that's funny? 
The Gatekeeper swirls his tassels. 
GATEKEEPER (CONT'D) How about that?  You like that? 
The Monster howls with delight. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY 
Nicky sits on the rocks, beaten and exhausted, eating a Popeye's drumstick. 
NICKY All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early. 
BEEFY I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects.  Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown. 
Beefy hears Nicky's strange terrible snores.  He's asleep. Beefy sighs. 
BEEFY (CONT'D) Kid's got a lot of evil in him, just begging to come out... 
Beefy walks away. 
EXT. VARIOUS CENTRAL PARK LOCATIONS - DAY 
Nicky snores.  Masses of birds fly out of the trees.  Nicky snores.  Squirrels run out of trees.  Nicky snores. 
ON WORRIED PEOPLE 
Staring at Nicky who continues to snore.  Two HEAVY-METAL GUYS, JOHN AND PETER, are listening to Danzig and doing a goofy dance.  They hear something and turn the music down: it's the distant sound of Nicky's snore. 
PETER Sounds like our devil dance actually worked this time. 
JOHN 'Bout time... 
Nicky snores.  It sounds like "I will eat your hearts."  The worried people run away.  Nicky snores.  Children on the Carousel, going real fast, upset.  Nicky snores. 
Peter and John walk over to a position near Nicky's bench. 
JOHN (CONT'D) There's our man. 
PETER Mr. Sleepyhead must have some major ties to the dark side. 
A sleazy STREET VENDOR shuffles over towards Nicky.  He eyes the flask which is half hanging out of Nicky's pocket. 
JOHN What's with that guy? 
PETER Gotta be one of his disciples or something. 
Suddenly, the Vendor grabs the flask (and Nicky's half-eaten drumstick) and runs off. 
JOHN Yo, man, I think that devil guy just got ripped off. 
PETER Should we wake him up? 
JOHN Yeah.  You do it. 
Peter gets up and shakes Nicky who comes to with a loud SNORT. 
PETER Rise and shine, devil guy.  Some dude just stole your shit. 
Nicky feels for the flask.  It's gone. 
STREET VENDOR Aw, take your dumb-ass canteen, goofy. (looking at Valerie) And you, take your raggedy-ass clothes and find a new corner.  Before I show you what real crazy is. 
The vendor does crazy eyes again. 
VALERIE Fine.  I will. 
Nicky picks up the flask and the drumstick. 
NICKY Hey, mister.  I'll be seeing you in a few years. 
Valerie gathers her blanket, starts walking away and Nicky follows her. 
NICKY (CONT'D) That was amazing.  Thanks so much.  You didn't have to do that. 
VALERIE That's okay.  I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it.  I hate when people take advantage of tourists.  It ruins it for the rest of us. 
NICKY You think I'm a tourist? 
VALERIE I'm sorry.  I just assumed.  Your accent maybe.  Where are you from? 
NICKY The South. 
VALERIE Really? 
NICKY Yeah.  Deep south. (laughs hard) 
She laughs along with him, not sure why. 
VALERIE Why are you laughing? 
NICKY I don't know, but I like it.  Say.  Your glasses are nice.  They make your eyes look sparkly and big.  It's fun to look at them. 
VALERIE My dad's an optometrist. 
NICKY My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart. 
VALERIE I'm sorry.  It's really tough when your parents get older. 
NICKY If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do. 
VALERIE Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out. 
Nicky is experiencing new sensations as he looks at her.  He hands her the half-eaten drumstick. 
NICKY Here, have a Popeye's.  This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'. 
VALERIE That's alright.  I already ate lunch.  I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati. 
NICKY Could I come with you to getting a Gelati? 
VALERIE If you want to. 
NICKY Want to?  A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back! 
VALERIE "Octopus people?" 
NICKY Uh, it's a deep south expression. 
Nicky laughs. 
EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
They exit the ice cream store, eating Gelati. 
NICKY It's freezing my hands. 
VALERIE It's not that cold.  Here, let me wrap it. 
Valerie takes a few napkins and wraps it for Nicky.  Just then the PREACHER walks by.  He quickly turns his head, sensing Nicky. 
PREACHER Why do you taunt me with your darkness?! Your evil is stinking up our streets! We're all gonna die! 
He takes off running right into a lamp post. 
VALERIE This town is really going to hell lately. (Nicky nods) So what part of the city do you live in? 
NICKY I have an apartment.  I don't remember exactly where.  My dog knows, though. 
We SEE a MINIATURE PEEPER squirming on the fish hook.  A giant fanged fish engulfs the Peeper's body.  Only his head is sticking out. 
PEEPER I deserve this! 
EXT. BAR - DOWN THE STREET - DAY 
Several ELEVEN YEAR-OLDS stumble out, drunk. 
KID I just stole twenty-five bucks off the bar. 
KID #2 How many beers did you have? 
KID # 3 Eight sips. 
KID I had five!  I'm so wasted. 
They both high five, throw up and fall.  PAN over to ADRIAN sitting on top of a mailbox laughing as he sips from a bottle of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS. 
ADRIAN When an adult goes to Hell, that's terrific.  But when a child goes... that's why I'm in this business. 
Adrian looks across the street and sees Nicky walking with Valerie.  He's shocked. 
Valerie is holding up a pair of drawstring pants from her collection. 
NICKY So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store? 
VALERIE Basically, yeah. 
NICKY Wow.  Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles. 
Valerie laughs. 
VALERIE You know what's nice about you?  You just seem happy being yourself.  You don't try to act cool. 
NICKY Thanks much.  You know what's nice about you, Valerie? 
VALERIE What? 
Up the street, Adrian's eyes redden.  NICKY looks like he's been stunned by something. 
NICKY Your juicy, heart-shaped ass. 
VALERIE What was that? 
NICKY (shocked and confused) I...I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that... 
QUICK CUT TO: 
Adrian's eyes flashing. 
NICKY (CONT'D) ...I've always wanted to have sex with a gross pig.  What do you say we go behind that dumpster, pull our pants down and see what happens? 
Valerie's very hurt. 
VALERIE You're a jerk. 
She turns and walks away.  Nicky looks over and sees Adrian. His inner voice speaks to him. 
NICKY (O.S.) ADRIAN! 
ADRIAN (O.S.) You shouldn't have come here. 
NICKY (O.S.) Please, get out of my mind! 
Adrian's eyes flash. 
NICKY (CONT'D) Hey, Valerie! 
She stops and turns.  Nicky RAISES his fist to resist Adrian's force.  It's too much.  His middle finger comes up, giving her the "finger." 
VALERIE What the hell's your problem? 
She runs away crying.  Nicky turns to Adrian who's still across the street. 
NICKY (O.S.) Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick. 
ADRIAN (O.S.) He's sick? 
BEEFY (high-pitched mocking) "But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make? 
Nicky, ashamed, gets a Coke out of the fridge and places it on the coffee table.  He and Beefy sit on the couch and stare at the Coke. 
BEEFY (CONT'D) You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid - engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss.  You just have to release the evil within you. 
NICKY Release the evil? 
BEEFY I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores. 
Nicky stares at the can. 
BEEFY (CONT'D) Release your evil... 
Nicky frowns and bites his lip.  The can rattles a little. 
TODD What are you doing? 
Todd is standing in the doorway.  Beefy runs to the fire escape. 
TODD (CONT'D) I know it's your living room night.  But can I finish watching the Globetrotters' game out here?  To me it's classic Comedia Dellarte. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
The TV clicks on.  We see TODD sit down and look at the TV. Nicky's behind him. 
ON TV 
INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY 
BILL WALTON What an odd game, folks.  The powerhouse 85-0 Harlem Globetrotters, who normal run circles around the 0-85 Nationals, seem to be struggling to find their groove in front of their hometown fans. 
A Globetrotter makes a fancy pass to another player, who makes a fancy pass to CORNROWS who starts doing some VINTAGE GLOBETROTTERS FANCY DRIBBLING.  The REF blows the whistle and makes the travelling signal. 
REF He's walking, get him a bus! 
BILL WALTON Oh, another awful call.  There is no way that was travelling. 
Ref takes ball from Cornrows, who gets in the Ref's face. 
CORNROWS What's with all these crazy calls?  You gotta watch that shit, we haven't lost a game in 53 years. 
REF Technical foul! 
Ref snaps just like Cassius in the players' face. 
ON TODD AND NICKY 
NICKY That guy in the striped shirt snaps his fingers like someone I know... 
ON TV 
The ref mind wrestles four globetrotters to simultaneously slam their heads on the scorers table again and again. 
ON TODD AND NICKY 
NICKY (CONT'D) It looks like the work of a brother... 
TODD A black guy? 
NICKY If it's Cassius, yes. 
Nicky races for the door. 
INT. BASKETBALL ARENA - DAY 
As the ref taunts the crowd, a fan wearing a Globetrotter's shirt yells out. 
GLOBETROTTER FAN Get your head out your ass, ref!  The kids came to see the Globetrotters win. 
REF Oh, so you wanna lip off to me? Unsportsmanlike conduct on the big mouth in the Globetrotter's shirt.  Take ten points off for the Globetrotters. 
The Globetrotter's score on the board goes from 46 to 36. 
ON STANDS 
Nicky throws an underhand shot.  The ball arcs through the air and is about to go in when the ref comes out of nowhere and swats it away. 
REF Get that crap outta here! 
The crowd BOOS!  Nicky and the ref stare at each other. 
NICKY (O.S.) I know you're having fun, Cassius, but you gotta come back to Hell. 
CASSIUS (O.S.) Look around you, Nicky.  We're in Hell. The New Hell. 
STANDS 
We see FITZIE, sitting between TWO PREGNANT WOMEN, raising the roof. 
COURTSIDE 
As the crowd BOOS, Nicky runs over and grabs the microphone. 
NICKY Listen up, New York.  Your souls are in great danger... 
Nicky gets hit by a hot dog. 
NICKY (CONT'D) Alright, how about this?  I get one more shot.  The ref will cover me.  I miss it, the Globetrotters forfeit the game. I make it, he doesn't ref the second half and we all start conducting ourselves like decent human beings again. 
The crowd is silent. 
NICKY (CONT'D) And we get free pizza. 
The crowd roars. 
INT. ANNOUNCING BOOTH - CONTINUOUS 
Bill Walton's hair is now burnt looking. 
BILL WALTON I think it's safe to say we're all rooting for this bizarre and hideous looking man. 
Bill Walton reaches over to an old lady sitting near him.  He takes off her wig, leaving behind her bald head, and puts her wig on his head in order to cover his burnt hair. 
The crowd starts YELLING. 
CROWD Nicky!  Nicky!  Nicky! 
STANDS 
John and Peter are yelling the loudest. 
COURTSIDE 
The ref walks to half-court and hands Nicky the ball. 
NICKY You know, Dad got very sick when you left. 
REF I heard.  I'm glad he's dying.  It's my turn now. 
Nicky's eyes get red, he starts dribbling. 
INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Beefy is watching, transfixed. 
BEEFY Take him to the hole, Nicky. (Todd stares) I mean, woof!  Woof! 
Todd looks at Beefy, terrified. 
INT. TUNNEL 
We see CORNROWS and some other Globetrotters are coming back from the locker room.  They stop to watch. 
INT. BASKETBALL COURT - MIDCOURT - CONTINUOUS 
Nicky pushes the ball up the court while the ref plays extremely tight defense.  Nicky fakes one way, then heads toward the basket.  The ref stays tight.  Nicky's eyes are redder than ever.  He fakes left, he fakes right.  He dribbles behind the back, dribbles between the legs, then takes his momentum up toward the basket.  He jumps from the foul line and flies through the air.  He emits a crazy, blood curdling, devil yell. 
CUT AWAY DURING DEVIL YELL TO: 
SHOT CLOCK 
It reads: 666. 
PAN UP from Popeye's laying everywhere.  Everyone's laughing hard. 
JOHN Come on.  One more time. 
NICKY Not again, fellas.  It kind of hurts. 
PETER Please.  You got to. 
NICKY (resigned) All right... 
Nicky loosens up his neck and makes his head go around 360 degrees.  Everyone cracks up, high fives.  Even Todd LAUGHS. PAN OVER to Beefy, who has bloodshot eyes. 
BEEFY I used to get baked like this with my first girlfriend, Heather.  We'd get so stoned she would forget I was a dog. 
JOHN She was human? 
BEEFY Actually, she was a sewer rat.  Man, that pissed my parents off. 
JOHN I dated a Japanese girl once.  My parents disapproved.  Not cause she's Japanese, but cause she was only fifteen. 
NICKY I'm only fifteen...thousand years old. 
Everyone cracks up. 
TODD I was in love one time but she said I wasn't financially reliable enough.  And she needed that. 
JOHN By she, do you mean he? 
TODD No. 
BEEFY Busted. (laughs) 
PETER How you feelin' over there, Satan Abdul Jabar? 
NICKY A little strange.  I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie. 
TODD Why?  Did she hurt you?  Do you miss her?  Need a shoulder to cry on? 
JOHN Easy, Liberace. 
TODD Oh, would you grow up. 
NICKY We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass. 
BEEFY Maybe you love her.  But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind. 
PETER Me, too.  We're gonna get going. 
TODD You guys want to stay?  I have a futon in my bedroom. 
JOHN That's a big pass, Elton John. 
PETER We're going to see Ozzy play at the Meadowlands, right now.  Wanna come, Nicky? 
NICKY No thanks.  I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves. 
JOHN Whoa, that chick must be the real deal, then.  Later on. 
NICKY See ya, fellas. 
They leave. 
BEEFY (O.S.) You better snap out of it soon, kid. Cause we're going after Adrian tomorrow. Seven AM.  Nighty, night. 
He falls asleep and starts snoring.  We hear the SOUND of THREE LITTLE GIRLS singing "Ring Around The Rosie" as he exhales. 
TODD That is the most frightening thing I have ever seen. 
Nicky stands and moves to the window.  He looks out longingly over the sleeping city... achingly.  RACK FOCUS behind him, we see Todd nodding encouragingly in the reflection. 
NICKY Todd.  Which way to the Parson's School of Design? 
EXT. PARSON'S SCHOOL OF DESIGN - NIGHT 
Nicky walks around the corner. 
SIGN READS: "Parson's School -  Student Housing" 
VALERIE What are you doing? 
NICKY I think I'm floating. 
VALERIE Why would you be floating? 
NICKY I don't know.  Maybe it's because of your sweet voice. 
VALERIE Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now?  Because I am. 
He's floating up.  He slows down. 
NICKY I can't see you but I can smell you. And you make me feel alive in a way I've never felt before. 
CUT TO REVEAL he's floating outside the student's window. The student's dripping candle wax on his belly. 
STUDENT You got the wrong window again, man. 
NICKY Oh.  Sorry, Andrew.  Valerie? 
Nicky resumes floating up. 
VALERIE I'm over here, Nicky!  To the left. 
Nicky is parallel with her.  He hovers in front of her, eyes still watering.  She punches Nicky in the face, and he flies back ten feet. 
VALERIE (CONT'D) Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger. 
NICKY That wasn't me.  I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian.  He's the one who call you a gross pig. 
VALERIE What do you mean, "possessed?" 
NICKY Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell? 
VALERIE Yes... 
NICKY Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years.  Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad... 
VALERIE ... "The Devil?"... 
NICKY ...to decompose.  And I love my  Dad very much.  So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and...well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you. 
His vision is clearing and he can start to see her.  She is totally in shock but still here. 
VALERIE Okay, now I get that "deep south" joke. 
Nicky laughs.  Valerie joins in. 
VALERIE (CONT'D) I don't know if I should believe you. 
Nicky starts to drop. 
NICKY You gotta believe me.  You gotta believe in the butterflies. 
VALERIE Okay, I do.  Get back up here. 
He floats up to her holding out his hand.  Nervously, she takes his hand and suddenly she is lifting off and they are flying. 
EXT. MANHATTAN - SKY - NIGHT 
They fly past the EMPIRE STATE BUILDING. 
VALERIE This is amazing. 
They soar past some more buildings. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
The preacher sense something.  He looks to the sky, then holds the cross from around his neck as high as he can. 
PREACHER The hellbeast is above us.  He's invading our skies!  We're all gonna die!  We're all gonna die! 
EXT. SKY - NIGHT 
VALERIE He's kind of ruining the mood. 
NICKY Let me take care of that. 
Nicky is panicking, out of breath.  A BUM (RADIOMAN) rises up out of his cardboard box.  The bum raises his bottle and thunks Nicky on the head.  It doesn't break. 
NICKY Ow...what was that for? 
BUM Fifty million dollars. 
The bum holds up a NEW YORK POST.  It reads "MONSTER WANTED!" And has a picture of Nicky.  Nicky is shocked. 
Nicky turns to run out of the alley, but the mob is there blocking the entrance.  He's trapped.  They start running right at him.  He closes his eyes. 
NICKY Release the evil. 
Nicky's body splits into about five-hundred horrifying insects, all with a miniature NICKY HEAD. 
The Nickysects run right at the crowd, and the crows immediately starts running the other way, completely freaked out. 
INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Beefy and Todd are watching TV.  They look over to see the insects scurry under the front door and morph back into one exhausted Nicky. 
NICKY I seem to be in trouble, Beefy. 
BEEFY The shit has hit the fan, kid.  Take a look. 
TODD Been breaking all morning. 
ON THE TV - DAY 
We see Dan Rather addressing the camera. 
DAN RATHER At a news conference earlier today, Chief of Police Andy Shaifer gave this beleaguered city its latest dose of bad news.  He revealed that the man who caused a sensation at basketball arena last night is no hero... he is, in fact, a mass murderer. 
We see the chief of police behind a bunch of mics.  He's holding up a picture of Nicky taken at the Basketball arena. 
INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Nicky's outraged. 
NICKY I didn't murder anybody 
BEEFY Look.  You were really high.  Things happen.

BEEFY I think you're looking at him.

CUT TO FOOTAGE on "SCARFACE" 
ON TV - DAY 
The Chief shakes his head. 
CHIEF OF POLICE Difficult to watch, I know.  In response to this vicious crime, I am authorizing the largest reward in law enforcement history: fifty million dollars to the person or persons who bring this man to me. 
INT. TODD'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Nicky stands outraged. 
NICKY This is baloney! 
BEEFY He superimposed your head onto "Scarface." 
TODD ...which is by far DePalma's best work... 
A LOUD KNOCKING AT THE DOOR 
Jimmy picks up the ear.  Jimmy speaks into it. 
JIMMY THE DEMON Check one-two.  Check one-two. 
DAD Put it back on my head.  I'm falling apart here. 
JIMMY THE DEMON He's got 'til midnight tonight, Nicky. (putting ear back on Dad) You get your ass back up there.  You save your father! 
Nicky looks very upset. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
We see John and Peter enter frame.  Looking very nervous. 
PETER You sure you're down with this? 
JOHN Little nervous.  Wanna puke. 
They approach the cops guarding the door. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Looking for the chief. 
PETER We know where to find Nicky. 
COPS grab John & Peter and drag them inside. 
INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY 
Surrounded by prostitutes and criminals in a very hot room, the chief of police puts down his bottle of PEPPERMINT SCHNAPPS, stands up and looks at the two idiots. 
CHIEF OF POLICE You have what I want? 
JOHN Sure do.  You got what we want? 
PETER Fifty million bones, bro. 
He nods to a DEPUTY who gives them a briefcase of money. 
CHIEF OF POLICE That's half of it.  You get the rest when I get Nicky. 
PETER Excellent.  But I gotta warn you, man. He's not human. 
CHIEF OF POLICE Really? 
JOHN We think he's the son of Satan. 
PAUSE.  The chief LAUGHS, then everyone else does.  He walks over and picks them up by their throats. 
CHIEF OF POLICE Well, then I guess I'll have to be extra careful.  Now where is he? 
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - DAY 
We see the BIG CLOCK on the wall.  FIVE minutes til NOON.  We see JOHN and PETER (with the briefcase) walking into GRAND CENTRAL with the chief and twenty-five NYC cops.  The chief bumps into a filthy bag lady drinking out of paper sack. 
BAG LADY Hey, watch it!  Who do you think you are? 
CHIEF OF POLICE (never stopping) Emperor of the New Hell. 
They march through onto the platform for Track 33. 
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - DAY 
We see Beefy and Todd waiting by the place where Nicky usually comes up.  It is hot down there.  Steam and smoke comes out of the tunnels.  Todd is nervous. 
TODD Where is he?  He's late. 
BEEFY He'll be here.  Just keep your cool, kid. 
They hear FOOTSTEPS.  They turn and see the chief of police backed up by the huge police force. 
BEEFY (CONT'D) We've been ratted out. 
Beefy and Todd turn to see John and Peter looking sheepish. 
TODD You guys.  That was so uncool. 
PETER We thought the son of Satan would understand a move like this. 
JOHN Uh.  No it won't? 
John starts to tremble a bit. 
ADRIAN Oh, Nicky, I've missed you.  Come on out and say hello... 
JOHN Urr...uggg...errr... 
ADRIAN (eyes getting red) I'm calling you out, brother... 
Adrian is mentally pulling Nicky out of John.  Nicky/John wages an epic battle with himself as Adrian smiles. 
JOHN/NICKY Urrr...uggh... (as Nicky) Oww.  Adrian, this is very painful. 
Nicky comes flying out.  John's body slumps to the floor next to the chief's.  Adrian looks in the "Schnapps bottle" to see the flask wrapped in paper.  He peeks inside. 
ADRIAN Hello, Cassius. 
CASSIUS (O.S.) All right.  Let me out. 
ADRIAN You know, New Hell really only needs one new Satan. 
CASSIUS (O.S.) You mother... 
Adrian hands Nicky the flask. 
ADRIAN But Cassius could use some company for the rest of eternity.  So get in the flask. 
He puts the Flask in Nicky's hands. 
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION - PAVILLION - MOMENTS LATER 
The police are escorting Beefy and Todd through the terminal. Beefy starts whining and stops.  The cops look down.  Beefy raises his leg. 
COP Oh, he's gotta pee. 
A thick, yellow smoke shoots out of Beefy, enveloping the group.  Beefy escapes and bolts back down stairs. 
TODD Run, Beefy!  Run! 
INT. GRAND CENTRAL STATION PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS 
Adrian stares down Nicky. 
NICKY I won't drink.  You can't make me. 
Adrian looks over at Valerie.  Suddenly she comes flying over to him.  He grabs her by the throat. 
We hear a train coming in the distance. 
ADRIAN Of course I can.  Drink or she dies. (Nicky is scared) Unlike you, she won't come back from where she's going. 
NICKY Let her go. 
ADRIAN I hear a train coming.  Drink. 
The train sound is coming CLOSER.  Valerie looks at Nicky. Nicky raises the flash to drink. 
VALERIE Don't do it. 
NICKY I have to, Valerie. 
We see Beefy skid to a stop, raise his leg and a full size archery arrow shoots out of his penis and tracks right into ADRIAN'S LEG. 
ADRIAN Ahhh! 
BEEFY Now that hurt the both of us. 
Valerie is able to escape momentarily.  Adrian reaches for her, grabbing her.  They both spin and fall down onto the tracks.  Right into the oncoming train. 
NICKY Valerie!!! 
Nicky leaps down onto the tracks, wrestles Valerie away from Adrian and tosses her off the tracks.  Adrian looks at Nicky. 
ADRIAN See you in Hell! 
WHAMM!  The train comes by, hitting both Adrian and Nicky. 
ADRIAN Welcome to the party.  It's so nice to see all of you here. 
NICKY (O.S.) Hey, that's Dad's throne!  How did Adrian get that?  Is Dad okay? 
ANGEL (O.S.) Let's see... 
RIPPLE DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
DAD LIPS are morosely talking to the Gatekeeper and Jimmy. 
DAD LIPS I was a good Devil, wasn't I? 
JIMMY THE DEMON You were the best Devil, boss, the best Devil! 
GATEKEEPER Absolutely. 
DAD LIPS I tried to do some interesting stuff... 
JIMMY THE DEMON You did amazing stuff! 
GATEKEEPER I don't know how you came up with some of it. 
DAD LIPS Really?  That means a lot to me. 
JENNA (O.S.) Oh my G-d.  He looks gross. 
ANGEL (O.S.) I can't believe I did it with him. 
She touches the pool again and the reflection changes to: 
EXT. NEW HELL THRONE - NIGHT 
Adrian steps off his throne onto a small stage flanked by SIX HERO DEMONS.  He begins addressing the crowd. 
ADRIAN I'm very proud of you.  You've taken to sin with minimal prompting. 
The crowd cheers. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) You're acting as if there is no Heaven or Hell. 
The crowd cheers. 
EXT. NEW HELL STAGE - NIGHT 
We see John, Peter, Beefy, Valerie and Todd hanging on flagpoles by their underwear.  Beefy is in a special fitted harness that looks like underwear. 
ADRIAN Well, I have some news. 
Adrian morphs into the Cardinal from earlier. 
CARDINAL There is most definitely a Hell!  And you're all going there when you die! Which will happen in about fifteen minutes. 
EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT 
The BAD PEOPLE realize they've been tricked into being bad and they get scared. The Preacher, who is now more battered from his fall through the plate glass window (ask Steve), yells out. 
PREACHER We really are gonna die! 
This kicks off a frenzy of the Scared Bad People trying to run away.  But they are stopped and herded back by DEMONS. 
EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS 
PETER This don't look good. 
JOHN Can't Beefy use his penis powers to get us out of this? 
TODD They castrated him.  He can't shoot arrows, he can't piss smoke. 
BEEFY I can't screw. (whimpers) I can't screw. 
Valerie's crying. 
INT. REFLECTION POOL - CONTINUOUS 
Nicky is shocked. 
She licks her finger and wipes some dirt off his forehead. 
ANGEL (CONT'D) That was such a Mom thing, wasn't it? 
FRIEND Totally. 
NICKY Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. (to Angel) Would it be okay if I called you Mommy? 
ANGEL It would be so okay. 
Nicky hugs his Mom. 
NICKY Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane. 
ANGEL (O.S.) You're already there... 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK POND SHORE - NIGHT 
Nicky dissolves into walking.  He checks his pocket to see the ball.  He looks up to see fifteen Demons marching towards him, ready to attack.  Nicky closes his eyes and concentrates. 
NICKY Release...the good. 
When he opens them, BEAUTIFUL BUTTERFLIES are floating around the head of five of the DEMONS.  They stop approaching. THEIR EYES TURN FROM WHITE BACK TO NORMAL.  And their facial expression changes to happiness.  They wave at the butterflies. 
ANGLE ON 
MORE DEMONS keep closing. 
NICKY (CONT'D) Release the good... 
Five more are stopped by something.  They look down and see fluffy white BUNNY RABBITS at their feet.  They start petting them. 
The REMAINING DEMONS advance on Nicky. 
NICKY (CONT'D) Release the awesome. 
...then stop, their path blocked by a very large bucket of POPEYE'S FRIED CHICKEN.  The Demons consider the bucket of chicken.  One Demon takes out a piece. 
NICKY (CONT'D) Put it in your mouth and let it slide down your throat-hole. 
The Demon bites into it.  He can't help but grin a little. 
DEMON Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'! 
The OTHER SOULS dig into the bucket. 
EXT. CLOCK TOWER - CONTINUOUS 
Only ten minutes left. 
EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS 
The dudes on the flagpoles are chatting nervously. 
TODD One thing I really regret is never having experimented sexually. 
PETER You mean, like, experiment with a Bunsen Burner?  What are you talking about? 
JOHN He means getting it on with someone like that freak. 
ANGLE ON: 
The student dancing for a mesmerized Demon. 
BACK ON PETER, TODD and JOHN 
TODD His name is Andrew.  I know that guy. 
JOHN Of course you do, Tommy Tune. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK PATH - NIGHT 
Nicky leads his small army of reformed Demons (followed by butterflies & bunnies and carrying the chicken bucket) down the path toward the rally.  We see they have a golden light/haze of good around them. 
EXT. FLAGPOLES - CONTINUOUS 
Adrian is underneath Valerie. 
Adrian turns the baby in the carriage into an EVIL DWARF who leaps out and starts beating up on the mother. 
Nicky turns the Mother into a HOT GIRL DWARF.  The evil Dwarf stops beating her up and holds her hand. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) Enough.  I'm going to kill you with my bare hands. 
Adrian punches Nicky hard in the jaw.  He goes flying off the platform. 
Nicky's body falls towards the ground.  It's about to hit, when a soft bed of posts and fluffy pillows break his fall. 
INT. HEAVEN - CONTINUOUS 
We now see Angel, Jenna, Christa and SEVEN OTHER GIRLS watching the action on the table. 
ANGEL I totally had to do that. 
ALL THE GIRLS Yah you did. 
CHUBBS is there, too. 
EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT 
Nicky looks up to see Adrian flying down towards him.  Nicky rolls away at the last second.  Adrian hits the bed hard and bounces up.  Nicky grabs him mid-bounce and slams him back down into the golden/brass headboard of the bed.  Nicky holds out the flask. 
NICKY Now I'm asking you nicely, get in the flas... 
Adrian grabs a pillow and hits Nicky hard in the face, sending him flying off the bed. 
NICKY (CONT'D) Oh, you wanna a pillow fight, do you?! 
Nicky is an expert pillow fighter.  He lands a series of awesome, almost Matrix-like pillow moves.  Adrian is dazed. 
Nicky finishes him off by tossing the pillow high in the air to him.  Adrian looks up to catch it and just before it lands, Nicky steps up and pops him in the face.  Adrian goes down hard.  Nicky towers over him. 
NICKY (CONT'D) Now will you get in the flask? 
ADRIAN Absolutely not. 
Adrian turns to his demons. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) A little help over here. 
A bunch of Demons advance. 
ON FLAGPOLE 
We see Henry Winkler, swollen with bee stings, valiantly run over and lowers the five from the flagpoles. 
ON ADRIAN 
He looks up and glares at Henry. 
ADRIAN (CONT'D) Henry! 
ON FLAGPOLE 
Henry's eyes widen. 
HENRY WINKLER Oh no. 
He is covered in bees again. 
BACK ON ADRIAN 
He turns his attention back to Nicky who is grabbed by demons.  Adrian brings the flask to his lips, but he won't open his mouth. 
Adrian pinches Nicky's nose closed so he has to open his mouth. 
ADRIAN Goodbye, Nicky. 
We hear CASSIUS banging against the walls. 
CASSIUS (O.S.) Come on in, bro. 
Nicky can't hold his breath and opens his mouth.  Adrian jams the flask in his mouth and Nicky starts to get sucked in. Adrian smiles.  But just before Nicky is gone, he manages to grab Adrian's coat tail and yank him into the flask with him. 
As the flask hits the ground, we HEAR: 
INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Dad is just a very thin pair of lips and one finger.  The FINGER is going up and down on the lips, making silly sounds. The Gatekeeper, the Monster, Jimmy the Demon and Lucifer are on their backs crying like babies. 
EXT. NEW HELL RALLY - NIGHT 
VALERIE Grand Central, Nicky.  Start running. 
JOHN He'll never make it. 
PETER You gotta kill yourself. 
NICKY I'll just go to Heaven. 
BEEFY No if you do something bad right before you die. 
PAUSE.  Everyone looks around.  Nicky spots Henry Winkler. 
HENRY WINKLER Aw, man, not again. 
NICKY Sorry, Henry. (focuses) Release the Evil. 
Henry is covered in bees once again. 
ON NICKY AND VALERIE 
Nicky picks up a big rock and hands it to Valerie. 
NICKY (CONT'D) Do me. 
VALERIE I love you. 
NICKY I love you. 
Valerie smashes the rock on Nicky's head, killing him. 
ON CLOCK TOWER 
Six seconds left. 
INT. THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The lips and finger are slowing down. 
INT. GATES OF HELL - DAY 
Nicky triumphantly passes through the wall of fire and it starts burning again behind him.  And now all the BACKED UP SOULS fall out on top of Nicky. 
The Gatekeeper APPLAUDS.

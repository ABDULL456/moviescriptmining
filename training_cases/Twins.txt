TWINS FADE IN: 
1   LONG BASEMENT CORRIDOR                                      1 The CAMERA is MOVING SLOWLY DOWN a long basement corridor. We hear a narrator (Werner) -- 
WERNER (V.O.) On his 35th birthday, I decided to tell Julius Benedict the truth about himself... 
2   CLOSE - LABORATORY HALL - DOORS - DAY (PERIOD)              2 
HOLD ON sign:   "Top Secret - Authorized Personnel Only." 
WERNER (V.O.) It wasn't that he was the product of a scientific experiment. 
3   INT. LABORATORY - DAY (PERIOD - 1952)                       3 
A white coated scientist (PROFESSOR WERNER) is studying a bizarre piece of equipment that looks suspiciously like a milkshake blender. With him is another scientist -- (this is TRAVEN -- already imperious, already a prick). 
WERNER (V.O.) An experiment designed to produce a physically, mentally and spiritually superior human being. I explained that to him when he was two years old. 
4   INT. MEDICAL EXAM ROOM - HALF A DOZEN MEN - DAY (PERIOD) 4 Most of them young, 20s and 30s. They are being given a medical examination by a group of doctors, including Werner. WERNER (V.O.) And it wasn't the complexity of Julius's parentage. He knew that unlike other little boys, he didn't have just one, but half a dozen fathers, all very distinguished men.                                   *

5   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CLOSE ON GORGEOUS WOMAN - DAY          5 (PERIOD) 
Not your Hollywood type. This is obviously a lady of character and talent. Her name we will come to learn is MARY ANN BENEDICT. She is on a hospital bed and being readied for surgery. 
WERNER (V.O.) Nor was it about the extraordinary woman chosen to be his mother... 
6   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY OUTSIDE DELIVERY ROOM - (PERIOD)      6 Traven emerges, sadly shaking his head. Werner tries to enter the room -- Traven won't permit it. 
WERNER (V.O.) Julius had long lived with the tragic news that she died giving birth to him.

WERNER (V.O.) His mother gave birth to another baby... 
10   INT. NURSERY - DAY (PERIOD)                                    10 
The serene baby.    Any mother's joy. 
29   INT. AIRPLANE - ON STEWARDESS                               29 Coming down the aisle, checking the passengers, as we hear: 
JULIUS (V.O.) (singing) 'Put on your red dress, baby 'Cause we're going out tonight...' A few passengers turn and look back at -- 
JULIUS seated in the rear, still in his peasant garb, the bamboo suitcase resting on his lap. He has his headphones on and is singing along to the music, his eyes closed and his head bobbing. JULIUS (singing) 'I better wear some boxing gloves, In case some fool might want to fight.' 
The STEWARDESS removes his headphones and considers Julius with amusement. STEWARDESS I knew you were trouble the second I laid eyes on you. Julius stares up at her, speechless and mesmerized. 
JULIUS (realizing) Sorry -- I've never heard this music before -- I love it.                             * She sighs, leans over him, fastens his seat belt, while Julius gazes down at her ample cleavage. 
STEWARDESS The captain wants us to buckle our seat belts because we're expecting a little turbulence. 
JULIUS (reading her name tag) Thank you, Betty Lou. (CONTINUED)

29   CONTINUED:                                                        29 STEWARDESS I bet you're a football player. 
JULIUS Actually, I'm a horticultural botanist, a mathematician, and a philosopher. 
STEWARDESS Right.    And I'm a brain surgeon. 
As the Stewardess heads back up the aisle, a MAN jumps up, grabs her around the neck with one arm and brandishes a gun in his other hand. 
HIJACKER (MAN) (to passengers) Nobody   moves, or else we're gonna have a   serious draft in here. (turns to another stewardess) Get the   captain. I want to discuss   our final destination. 
He continues maneuvering the Stewardess up the aisle. His back is totally to Julius now. 
JULIUS turns to the terrified elderly woman beside him who's clutching a hardcover Bible in her lap. JULIUS (whispers) Excuse me, ma'am. 
As he takes the book from her, quickly draws back his arm -- CUT TO: 
HIGHJACKER 
The gun at the panicked Stewardess's head, he continues slowly up the aisle, shouting for everyone to freeze, not even to think about moving -- -- now a hardcover book comes rocketing through the air, hits him in the back of the neck and he goes limp, fall- ing across some seats, the gun dropping from his hand. CUT TO:

grabbing him, all of them brave and heroic -- a lot of commotion -- shouts of "I've got him," "Don't move," etc. CUT TO: 
HAND retrieving the hardcover Bible from the floor and -- 
CUT TO: 
OLD WOMAN 
as Julius smiles reassuringly, returns her Bible to her, sits back in his seat. JULIUS (gently; calming her) His mischief shall return upon his own hand, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own head -- Psalm 7:16. In front now, there is a lot of activity as various pass- engers hold the Highjacker, almost arguing over who's in control. Julius looks at them a moment, puts on his headset, closes his eyes and is soon bopping away to the music. CUT TO:

C37   INT. BAR - DAY (LATER)                                          C37 
A booth at the back of the restaurant: Vince is seated with the two Klane brothers. He hands over the money he picked up from the BMW -- $4000. The smaller Klane counts it quickly. BURT KLANE This is only four thousand -- 
VINCE The rest is invested.     We're gonna make a fortune. 
Bob suddenly punches Vince in the side knocking the breath out of him. BOB KLANE (ominous) Shut up. (CONTINUED)

LINDA I hope this helps -- Please don't hurt him. 
BURT KLANE There you go -- (he counts Linda's money) -- Another thousand -- Okay -- This nice lady just bought you a day Vince -- I want it all -- Twenty- thousand -- this time tomorrow.                        * 
VINCE Twenty -- ?   But I just paid -- Just as he opens his mouth, Vince is elbowed again. BURT KLANE That's just the interest.    The                       * twenty's the principal.                                * 
37    INT. BAR - NEAR DOOR - DAY (LITTLE LATER)                    37 Linda is walking Vince out. VINCE That was the most wonderful birthday present anybody ever gave me -- LINDA It's your birthday?   Why didn't you tell me? VINCE (suddenly honest) I can't take the kindness.    It gives me the shakes. LINDA You'll tremble plenty before we're through, Vince Benedict. They kiss.

Immediately behind him, facing the opposite direction, is another man, also pulling on his left ear with his right hand. It is Julius -- 
-- Their backs are to each other. Without ever catching sight of one another, they move off, going their separate ways. Now, from this --

Downtown Hollywood in all it's sleeze.

We're a long way from his island now. He studies all the humanity swirling around him -- CUT TO:

Young boys in uniform are raucously enjoying their recess under the supervision of several nuns in habits. 
JULIUS (V.O.) So, this is where my brother grew up. I'm glad he had so many friends to play with.                                     * 
50    INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - DAY                                   50 An elderly MOTHER SUPERIOR looks dubiously at Julius as he stares out the window down on the playground. He turns and examines the dormitory which is lined with metal cots. He points to a cot near the door and smiles fondly. JULIUS And that's where he must have slept. 
MOTHER SUPERIOR How did you know? 
JULIUS It's the one I would have chosen. It's next to the fire extinguisher. In case of a fire, I could have given the alarm, and saved the other orphans. MOTHER SUPERIOR We've only had one fire at St. Charlotte's. Vince Benedict started it, we like to think by accident.

She locates a file, removes it; the only thing inside it is a photograph, which falls to her desk. MOTHER SUPERIOR That's odd... the contents of his file are missing. Julius picks up the photo -- a 13-year-old boy leering up at an attractive young nun. 
JULIUS This is him?   He looks happy --                        * MOTHER SUPERIOR (sighing) He should -- that's Sister Maria,                       * his biology teacher. 
JULIUS I always liked biology. MOTHER SUPERIOR So did Vincent. He disgraced Sister Maria, who had to leave the order. Then he stole all the money from our library fund and ran away.

JULIUS But I have to find him.   Where do you think he might be? 
MOTHER SUPERIOR Jail. A man of his character could only be in jail. You're full of goodness, Julius -- I pray that you never find him. 
Sweet smile as the door is closed and we -- CUT TO:

We're talking a SEVEN FOOTER here. A bad tempered Seven Footer. SEVEN FOOTER (to Vince who is scowling at him) What're you lookin' at? VINCE At you, you jerk. The Seven Footer rises angrily to his full size. Vince moves right in on him -- he may be going through a bad patch, but make no mistake, Vince is tough.

MORRIS KLANE You gotta understand something, Benedict -- I like my work. He pulls  Vince groggily up and this time he's going for Vince's  face. He takes his time setting Vince up, getting  his chin at just the right angle. He's concen- trating  on his work, so he doesn't pay much attention to the fact  that the elevator door has opened behind. 
Klane draws   his fist back and is about to drive it into Vince's face   when he suddenly pauses; the expression on his face, at   first puzzled, becomes increasingly agonized as we REVEAL   that --

JULIUS (to Linda or to Vince) That's not necessary. I always sleep on the floor. Vince looks askance at Julius, then pulls the car away. HOLD ON Linda and Marnie, gazing curiously after them. CUT TO:

But you had none of that. 
Vince remembers. All the bravado about loving being an orphan has gone now. 
JULIUS You had nobody. Nobody to love you, nobody to trust you, nobody to encourage you. All life taught you was that the only person you could count on was yourself. Tears begin to well up in Vince's eyes.

With planes landing in the early morning behind him, we see -- 
CLOSEUP OF JULIUS standing -- waiting -- trying to pick up the scent... DISSOLVE TO: 
F170   EXT. DOWNTOWN HOUSTON - DAY                               F170 Julius strides purposefully along, carrying his suitcase. He reaches a sign-posted intersection, looks in all di- rections, chooses one, begins to move. As he does, a CREEP starts walking along with him, eyeing his suitcase, just like the Biker did when Julius first arrived in Hollywood. CREEP (holds up cigarette) Got a light, pal?                                      * Julius, without breaking stride, turns his head, looks at the Creep. JULIUS (scary) Don't fuck with me... pal. The Creep falls back. 
G170   EXT. WAREHOUSE (HOUSTON) - ESTABLISHING - DAY             G170 Vince pulls up in the Caddy.

170   INT. WAREHOUSE (HOUSTON) - DAY                             170 He drives inside a large warehouse, parks, gets out and looks warily around. He opens the trunk, unzips the sleeping bag, revealing the merchandise. BEETROOT (O.S.) Step away from that car, Mr. Benedict. 
WEBSTER Vince, if you don't cut this horseshit I may have to hurt you. 
JULIUS (over) Leave my brother alone! 
As Webster whirls, looks around -- 
CUT TO: 
TWINS - Rev. 5/2/88                                    129/130. 
A173   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                       A173 Vince, outside, really chugging away now, doing his best Carl Lewis imitation.

Julius looking down at Webster from the floor above.    His hands are held high. In one of them is a briefcase. 
JULIUS I've got the money. WEBSTER (gun trained on Julius) Well don't be shy -- (gesturing) -- come on down. CUT TO: 
TWINS - Rev. 4/28/88                                   131.          * 
C173   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                          C173 As Vince puts distance between himself and the   warehouse. Suddenly he stops, as if he's heard or "felt"   something. He shakes the feeling off, resumes running...   and then stops again, shuts his eyes tightly, trying to   deny what's happening to him. 
VINCE No way... this is bullshit... (eyes snapping open) Julius, you putz. 
Vince turns and runs back towards the warehouse. CUT TO: 
D173   INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                          D173 as Julius gracefully shinnies down a cable, lands near Webster. He tosses the suitcase to the ground, backs away. Webster approaches. Julius' hands, as before, are held high over his head. WEBSTER Just exactly who are you? JULIUS Vincent's twin brother -- we're in this together. WEBSTER Keep your hands that way. JULIUS Don't be nervous -- I hate violence and I never carry guns. 
E173   EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                          E173 Vince peering in through the window he jumped out of, takes in the scene. VINCE (muttering) Goddam ESP-psycho-voodoo bullshit... 
F173   INT. WAREHOUSE - BACK TO WEBSTER - DAY                        F173 
Opening Julius' suitcase. He pulls out Julius' old clothes, tosses them aside, then removes some books, books, and more books. (CONTINUED)

JULIUS I needed something to read on the airplane. 
WEBSTER (raising rifle) Yeah, well your flying days are over... 
CUT TO: 
SUITCASE WITH THE MONEY flying through the air, landing near Webster's feet. VINCE (O.S.) Put the goddam gun away -- you're a multimillionaire. CUT TO: 
VINCE hands held high, appears, stands beside Julius. 
WEBSTER 
He covers them both, kneels, opens Vince's suitcase, glances at the money inside. 
VINCE AND JULIUS both with their hands up, look at one another and begin arguing. 
VINCE I am never going to forgive you for this. 
JULIUS You were going to get killed. I tried to distract him so you could escape.

EXT.  STREET IN GEORGETOWN -- MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT 
Fog hangs above the street, amongst the streetlamps.  Apartment buildings line the curb, it is very quiet.  In one building, six floors up, a bedroom light is on.  WE SEE the silhouette of Norman's WIFE looking out the window. 
WIFE (O.S.) What kind of a crash was it? 
NORMAN (O.S.) You seen my suitcase? 
WIFE (O.S.) There's nothing on the news about a crash.  Did he say what airline? 
NORMAN (O.S.) He didn't say much at all.  Honey -- 
WIFE (O.S.) In the closet.  I don't understand, Norman -- why would they call you? 
NORMAN (O.S.) Don't be so supportive, honey. 
WIFE (O.S.) Well, I can't imagine five years of unemployment -- 
NORMAN (O.S.) Four.  Four years -- 
WIFE (O.S.) Four years of unemployment would look too good on a resume. 
NORMAN (O.S.) Keep watching the news.  Are you watching the news? 
WIFE (O.S.) How are you getting to the airport? You need money for the bus? 
A tinted-window black SEDAN travels down the street, pulls up in front of the apartment building.  A U.S.  NAVY decal is on the door. 
WIFE (O.S.) There's a U.S.  Navy car outside, Norman. 
NORMAN (O.S.) What? 
WIFE (O.S.) Was it a military crash? 
NORMAN (O.S.) I don't know. 
WIFE (O.S.) They never used to send a Navy car. 
CUT TO: 
THE LOUD, HARD CHOPPING OF A HELICOPTER PROPELLER 
EXT.  PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY 
Blinding sunlight, as the helicopter WHIPS by, speeding above the Pacific Ocean. 
INT.  HELICOPTER -- DAY 
Norman, 53, disheveled, unshaven, sits in the back.  He studies a pamphlet in his hand: "AIRCRASH SURVIVAL: HOW TO COPE".  The PILOT, in the cockpit, turns to him. 
PILOT What kinda work you in, Dr. Johnson? 
Norman quickly stuffs the pamphlet into his dufflebag. 
NORMAN I'm in psychology.  Was.  Still am really, just been a while. (beat) I treat aircrash survivors. 
PILOT Oh, so you're that Dr. Johnson. 
NORMAN You've heard of me? 
PILOT Well, everybody's been talking about that report you wrote. 
NORMAN What report? 
PILOT Huh? 
NORMAN What report? 
PILOT You mean you don't know? 
NORMAN Know what? 
The pilot glances back at him again. 
PILOT Must be another Johnson then.  Been flying so many scientists out here -- can't keep everyone straight. 
NORMAN Who's everyone? 
PILOT Physicists, mathematicians, geologists, you name it. 
NORMAN Geologists?  At a plane crash? 
PILOT Strange, isn't it?  In the middle of the ocean no less. 
NORMAN What the hell would a geologist be doing at a plane crash? 
Norman looks out the window and sees a group of ships circling in the water. 
EXT.  SHIP DECK -- DAY 
The helicopter descends down onto the helipad, wind gusting about.  A young, female OFFICER -- holding her hat to her head -- rushes to greet Norman, as he climbs out of the helicopter. 
She looks down crudely at his shotty, nylon dufflebag. 
OFFICER Any other bags, Dr. Johnson? 
NORMAN Just that.  Careful, it's heavy. 
She lugs it over her shoulder, no problem. 
OFFICER No other equipment?  Scientific instruments? 
NORMAN No, they didn't say -- 
OFFICER This way, sir. 
Norman follows the officer away from the helipad. 
INT.  SHIP 
She leads Norman down a flight of stairs. 
OFFICER Captain Barnes wants to see you right away, sir. 
NORMAN Captain who? 
The hatch door LOCKS, loudly.  The sub lurches, and begins descending. 
TED Pussy. 
BETH What's that -- mistake number two, Norman? 
NORMAN He wasn't feeling well. 
TED He's a pussy. 
Harry is still staring at Norman... 
HARRY How are you feeling, Norman? 
NORMAN What? 
HARRY You holding up alright? 
NORMAN Fine.  I'm fine. 
HARRY Don't be defensive. 
NORMAN I'm not being defensive. 
HARRY You sound defensive. 
NORMAN I'm fine. 
TED (to Harry) What'd you say to him? 
HARRY To who?  Arthur?  Nothing.  Nothing that Norman doesn't already know. 
TED What does Norman already know? 
HARRY Norman thinks we shouldn't be going down.  Thinks it's a mistake. 
Norman looks over at Beth. 
HARRY She told me what you said, Norman. 
TED What is it, Harry? 
HARRY Just one of Norman's many secrets. 
ON NORMAN, saying nothing. 
EXT.  OCEAN 
WE SEE the sub descending into darker waters. 
EXT.  DH-8 HABITAT -- ARRIVING DOCK 
The SUB descends into the AIRLOCK, metal clanks against metal.  Around it, the DH-8: interwoven cylinders lit up with lights. 
INT.  AIRLOCK -- PRESSURIZING ROOM 
CLOSE ON THE HATCH DOOR closing tightly, locking. 
OFFICER (O.S.) One moment for pressurizing. 
A SOFT WHIRR. 
ANGLE ON -- Barnes and the four remaining team members standing in the small, claustrophobic pressurizing room.  Like sardines.  Nobody says anything.  A long beat. 
THE DOOR 
in front of them, opens.  TEENY FLETCHER, 30s, a big-boned female officer, stands before them.  She wears a black plastic PAD, a "talker", around her neck. 
She hands each member their own "talker".  Norman takes his. 
INT.  DH-8 HALLWAY 
Fletcher leads Barnes and the team members down the hallway.  Each of them wears the "talkers" around their necks. 
BARNES They pressurize us with helium. 
NORMAN What's wrong with oxygen? 
BARNES It's a corrosive gas.  On earth, it makes a half-eaten apple turn brown and puts the ugly, iron rust on an Oldsmobile.  At a pressure this low, oxygen becomes toxic.  Breathe it down here, and it'll do to your dick what it does to the Oldsmobile. 
TED Important safety tip.  Thanks Captain. 
Fletcher listens through her radio earpiece, turns to Barnes... 
FLETCHER Captain, the divers have the airlock mounted at the door.  The robot is now in position to enter the spacecraft. 
TED Robot?  What robot? 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
CLOSE ON A MONITOR -- showing the robot in front of the curved gray metal of the spacecraft. 
BARNES Edmunds, bring up the robot's camera feed. 
JANE EDMUNDS, 32, the unit archivist, works the control panel.  Another MONITOR clicks on -- showing the robot's POV of the door. 
TED Captain, you know, I really appreciate you hauling us a thousand feet below sea level so we can watch this historical event on television. 
BARNES Nobody goes inside, until we know what's inside. 
ON THE MONITOR -- THE ROBOT CAMERA scans the spacecraft hull, stops on a rectangular panel mounted to the left of the door. 
BARNES Can you open that panel? 
EDMUNDS Working on it now, sir. 
ON THE MONITOR -- a robotic CLAW extends out to the panel.  Trying to pry the panel open. 
TED I'd like it noted in the report that I think we should be doing this ourselves.  Making a manned entry... 
The claw is clumsy, and keeps banging into the metal. 
TED I'd also like it noted -- 
BARNES Duly noted, Ted.  Edmunds, try using suction. 
ON THE MONITOR -- another robotic arm extends out, with a rubber sucker.  It pushes against the panel, but doesn't suck. 
EDMUNDS It's not sucking, sir. 
BARNES Thank you, I can see that.  Try something else. 
EDMUNDS We don't have anything else to try, Sir. 
BARNES Well, shit -- find something, do something... make something up -- 
In the huge MOUND OF CORAL covering the spacecraft, WE SEE a tunnel -- cut out like a cave -- lined with tiny, dim lightbulbs. 
INT.  TUNNEL 
About 60 feet deep.  Narrower than they'd like.  Norman descends, clumsily, awkwardly -- pushing off the bulky, iron handles fastened to the coral walls. 
THE LOUD HISSING OF AIR 
INT.  SPACECRAFT AIRLOCK 
CLOSE ON NORMAN'S FACE as he watches the water recede, down past his faceplate. 
THE LOUD BANGING OF METAL 
Ted has wedged a crowbar into the door and BANGS at it with a sledgehammer. 
HARRY Easy Ted, we're not mining gold. 
TED Gimme some room here, will you?  Back off.  Gimme some space. 
They all back away, cramming into the far corner of the airlock as Ted keeps swinging. 
BETH Looks alot like an airplane door, doesn't it? 
Ted stops and looks at the door. 
TED Alot like.  You know, I noticed it before, but I didn't... 
HARRY Shutup, Ted.  You didn't notice shit. Keep hammering. 
NORMAN You want me to try? 
TED You're a 53 year old shrink, what are you gonna do? 
BARNES Give him the hammer, Ted. 
Norman takes the hammer.  Walks up to the wedge.  Gets his bearings. Rears back... then stops. 
TED What is it, your back give out? 
Something has caught Norman's eye.  He looks down at the wedge. 
BARNES What is it, Norman? 
NORMAN Take a look. 
Barnes comes toward him.  The others follow.  Barnes bends down, looks closely down at the wedge in the door. 
BARNES It's chipped. 
HARRY Chipped?  The door?  How can it be chipped? 
BARNES I don't know how it can be chipped, but it's chipped. 
HARRY I thought you said there wasn't any damage done in the crash? 
BARNES I did. 
HARRY Then how can it be chipped? 
ON BETH -- she touches the door with her palms, feels around. 
BETH There's heat coming the door. 
BARNES Back away then. 
BETH Wait a minute -- 
BARNES I said back away. 
BETH Would you wait a minute? 
THE DOOR STARTS TO RUMBLE 
Barnes unstraps a GUN -- nearly the size of an uzzi -- from his buckle. 
BARNES Ted, get her away from the door. 
TED What are you going to do -- shoot her? 
The RUMBLING louder... 
BARNES Get her away! 
THE DOOR begins to slide open. 
Beth backs away. 
THE DOOR, sliding, is revealing COMPLETE BLACKNESS inside.  The door stops, it's open, it's quiet.  They all stand there, looking at BLACKNESS.  A long beat. 
INT.  SPACECRAFT 
ON NORMAN -- cautiously stepping inside.  His helmet light SHINES on the others ahead of him, walking along a 5 foot wide CATWALK, suspended high in the air. 
Metallic BEAMS and RAFTERS criss-cross above them. 
Norman looks over the railing -- his light STROBES through 40 feet of darkness, dimly lighting the LOWER HULL, a dense network of STRUTS and GIRDERS. 
TED Look at this. 
BARNES What is it? 
Ted SPOTLIGHTS the OUTER HULL. 
TED Some sort of lead or something. 
BARNES Radiation shield, you think? 
TED A foot and a half thick?  That'd withstand a helluva lot of radiation. 
Beth's light SHINES down onto the CATWALK.  WE SEE FOOTPRINTS outlined on the dusty floor. 
BETH Hold on -- 
BARNES What is it? 
BETH Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up? 
TED No.  I don't think so. 
BETH Well, think.  Because there's footprints here that aren't mine. 
TED Well, they're not mine. 
ON THE FOOTPRINTS -- large, like the boots they're wearing. 
BARNES What would we be working on in the future that would make us want to come back? 
TED Maybe we didn't want to come back. 
BACK IN -- THE ROOM 
Norman, Harry, and Beth... 
BETH What are you looking for? 
HARRY A light switch.  A button opened that door -- the craft runs on some sort of power. 
ON NORMAN -- as he sits down in one of the CHAIRS. 
BETH What's that noise? 
They LISTEN to a GIRGLING NOISE. 
NORMAN Sounds a little like water -- 
SUDDENLY -- the chair Norman's in -- wraps around him, squeezing him inside, padding sliding around his head, his shoulders enveloping him -- sucking him inside... 
BETH Norman! 
NORMAN Get this thing off me. 
Beth bends down, presses a button, the CHAIR releases Norman... 
BETH I think the chair thinks you want to fly this thing. 
ON BETH's FACEPLATE -- as she's looking down -- WE BEGIN TO SEE -- reflected in her faceplate: yellow digital lettering sputtering across... 
"RV-LHOOQ... DCOM1... " 
Her EYES look up slowly... as we 
CUT TO: 
THE BLACK SCREEN in front of the chairs, lit up with bright yellow lettering: 
"RV -- LHOOQ -- DCOMl -- U.S.S STAR VOYAGER" 
"ASSIMILATING DATABASE" as a series of numbers race upwards in count... 
And the desk in front of them LIGHTS UP, a control panel coming to life. 
HARRY Nice work, Norman. 
NORMAN Whatever I can do to help. 
ON THE SCREEN as it changes, now filled with columns: 
SHIP SYSTEMS DATA SYSTEMS QUARTER MASTER FLIGHT RECORDS 
Harry punches some keys on the control panel. 
HARRY A flight recorder.  Our future is about to be seen in our present. 
ON THE SCREEN as it changes: 
FLIGHT DATA SUMMARIES FDS 01/01/47-12/31/49 FDS 01/01/50-12/31/52 FDS 01/01/53-12/31/55 FDS 01/01/56-12/31/56 FDS 01/01/56-02/01/56 FDS 02/02/56-UNKNOWN ENTRY EVENT 
NORMAN 01-01-47.  Two thousand-forty seven. 50 years in our future. 
HARRY Unknown Entry Event. 
Harry pauses, looks down, and punches more keys... 
ON THE SCREEN -- as it expands in size, widens around them, curving... WE SEE a galaxy of stars, planets coming OFF THE SCREEN, into the room, becoming three dimensional, suspended in air, giving the illusion of depth. 
The IMAGE begins streaking outward, TOWARD US, moving rapidly, like we're flying through it. 
The stars and other space matter streaking by. 
BETH What's that cluster of stars there? In the center? 
Harry stares, walking around the desk, moving into the 3-D image... 
HARRY Our answer. 
NORMAN To what? 
HARRY Time travel.  A black hole. 
The CLUSTER of stars grows brighter and brighter, as it comes closer and closer, brightening. 
The FIELD twists and turns as the SCREEN and FIELD become BLINDING as WE ENTER the cluster, the black hole. 
ON NORMAN -- his face, bright, FRIGHTENED as he HEARS: 
HARRY (O.S.) Ted?  Captain? 
BARNES (O.S.) Yes, Harry. 
HARRY (O.S.) We know how this craft got here. Where it's been. 
BARNES (O.S.) So do we.  And it seems to have picked up something on it's travels. 
STILL ON NORMAN -- frightened... 
NORMAN Picked up something?  What is it? 
BARNES (O.S.) I don't know.  But it's something alien. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CARGO BAY 
ANGLE ON our six team members' BOOTS, in the distance.  AS WE PAN UP and AROUND WE SEE a curved surface appear: a surface of slowly swirling green and blue fluids.  Like mercury.  Mesmerizlng. 
AS WE COME AROUND, the team stands looking at the SPHERE, 30 feet in dlameter, held by a GIANT CLAW gripping it from the top. 
They walk around it, circling it, looking up at it. 
HARRY This answers one of our questions. 
NORMAN Which one?  Let me get the list out. 
HARRY This spacecraft was designed to pick things up.  They see things they want -- these claws go out and bring it in.  They come across this.  This... sphere.  Find it interesting, curious.  They draw it inside to take back home. 
NORMAN But on the way home, they miss their turn, go too far, into the past. 
HARRY Our present. 
BARNES But what does it do?  This... sphere. 
NORMAN Meaning we're never gonna get the chance to tell anyone. 
HARRY Meaning we're never gonna get to the surface alive... to tell anyone. 
Norman gets out of his bed. 
NORMAN I can't believe that, Harry. 
HARRY Gimme another explanation. 
Norman pacing. 
NORMAN I can't.  If I had a minute to think, maybe, but I know you're wrong. 
HARRY Am I? 
NORMAN Look -- we're under a lot of pressure, we're tired, you're not thinking straight. 
HARRY You mean, you think I'm cracking? 
NORMAN No.  I didn't say that. 
HARRY Then what, Norman? 
Norman stops pacing, a beat. 
NORMAN It's what's in that sphere, isn't it, Harry?  Whatever you think is in that thing -- you think it's going to kill you. 
HARRY Curious, isn't it?  What's inside? Before I die, I'd sure like to open it and see. 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
CLOSE ON MONITOR: Video of the sphere.  RAPIDLY rewinding. 
BARNES What caused it? 
EDMUNDS Nothing.  I don't know.  Everything was normal.  No changes at all. 
HARRY When did it happen? 
EDMUNDS Seconds ago.  Here! 
PLAYBACK: WE SEE the sphere -- idle.  Nothing around it.  Then it's DOOR slowly OPENS, revealing BLACKNESS inside.  A beat.  And then it closes. 
BARNES Let me see that again. 
Edmunds plays it again.  This time... 
WE MOVE IN ON HARRY, staring at the monitor. 
HARRY (to himself) I'd sure like to open it and see. 
ON HARRY -- those cold, intelligent eyes. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON PRINTER, TYPING: "... 30 knots -- ETD -- 00:19 min" 
CUT TO: 
INT.  HALLWAY 
CLOSE ON -- Norman and Barnes. 
BARNES Don't get hysterical, Norman. 
NORMAN I'm telling you, Harry's lost it. He's saying there's a deathwish out for each of us. 
BARNES Look, the ships are clearing out. They're taking us topside in a matter of minutes.  Someone can check him out there, if it's that imprtant. 
NORMAN All I'm saying is, someone should keep an eye on him. 
BARNES Just worry about yourself. 
INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM 
Barnes on the phone with the surface.  Ted talking to him anyway... 
TED Can I stay, sir?  I'm willing to risk it.  I am.  After what we just witnessed. 
BARNES (into phone) What?  No, I know they're civilians... 
INT.  LIVING QUARTERS 
ON NORMAN -- gathering his things.  Stuffing his shotty dufflebag. 
Beth, at her bunk, doing the same. 
Norman stands up.  Looks at the bunk above him: unpacked clothes, unpacked belongings, a notebook lying there saying: PROPERTY OF DR. HARRY ADAMS. 
ON NORMAN -- panicking, looking around for Harry. 
CUT TO: 
BACK IN -- COMMUNICATIONS ROOM 
BARNES (into phone) ... I said send the subs down, damn it! 
Barnes out the door, Ted at his heels... 
TED Did you hear me, sir, because -- 
BARNES Ted, shut up.  Are you packed?  Ready to go?  I want everyone packed.  Now! 
ON NORMAN -- running at them... 
NORMAN Harry's missing. 
BARNES What do you mean, he's missing? 
NORMAN He's missing.  He's gone.  He left. 
BARNES He's here somewhere.  Find him.  The sub's on it's way. (they look at him) Go!  C'mon! 
Norman runs off.  Barnes storms down the hall... 
BARNES How can he be missing? 
TED Sir, about leaving -- 
BARNES We're on the bottom of the fucking ocean -- he can't just walk outside! 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
Edmunds working the monitors, stops.  Seeing something on a screen. Staring in horror... 
FLETCHER Squid... 
Harry stops mid-chew.  Frightened. 
FLETCHER ... there was a whole flock of them out there earlier.  It's strange. It's dead down here, and then all of a sudden -- 
Harry drops his fork.  He begins COUGHING.  HACKING.  CHOKING loudly. GAGGING.  He HACKS out the squid from his mouth... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  HABITAT CORRIDOR 
A long, empty corridor.  All is quiet. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON A MONITOR -- a series of numbers: 
NORMAN When did it come across? 
EDMUNDS Minutes ago.  Harry's trying to decode it in his room now. 
NORMAN Where's it coming from? 
EDMUNDS No idea.  We have no surface support. It transmitted too fast to be coming from underwater. 
NORMAN Is it coming from our own computer? 
EDMUNDS Harry thinks it's some sort of discharge from our own system, but I've seen it discharge before -- and it didn't look anything like this. 
EXT.  HABITAT -- UNDERWATER 
SWARMS of pretty, pink JELLYFISH.  Everywhere. 
FROM UNDER THE HABITAT -- Fletcher swims up to them with a net.  It's beautiful.  Eerie.  Almost idyllic. 
INT.  LIVING QUARTERS 
Harry, on his bunk with decoding papers in his hands, turns to Norman, entering the room. 
NORMAN Getting anywhere with those? 
HARRY There's some sort of pattern here. It'll take a minute. 
NORMAN Have you looked outside?  Jellyfish. Everywhere.  I hate jellyfish. (sits on the table) Harry, what happened in the cafeteria? 
HARRY Don't do this.  Don't psychoanalyze me.  I hate squid.  Period.  Just like you hate jellyfish. 
NORMAN You said something to me, before -- about how we were all going to die. 
HARRY Did I? 
NORMAN You don't remember that? 
HARRY I don't remember much.  It's like my memory is on the tip of my tongue -- but I can't taste any of it.  Funny, my senses are much keener though. Purer.  Hearing, seeing, smelling. Like, I can smell your sheets, Norman.  You tried to wash it out earlier, But I can still smell the urine. (beat) Don't worry, I'm not going to tell the others.  It's normal, really, isn't it?  In a crisis.  The stress. The panic. 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
Beth, Ted, and Barnes watch... 
ON A MONITOR -- Fletcher outside, with the jellyfish. 
BARNES (into the mic) Fletcher?  What are you doing out there? 
FLETCHER (O.S.) They're like pink snow, sir.  Sticky. 
TED She says jellyfish are a delicacy. You know, I never knew that. 
BARNES Get out of there.  I don't want anyone going anywhere outside, understood? 
FLETCHER (O.S.) They're warm.  I can feel the heat on my legs. 
BARNES Fletcher, I want you back here. 
CUT TO: 
BACK IN -- LIVING QUARTERS 
Norman sitting on the table... 
NORMAN What happened to you inside that sphere, Harry? 
A long beat.  Harry becomes concerned... 
HARRY Why?  Does someone else want to go inside? 
CUT TO: 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
ON THE MONITOR -- Fletcher, the jellyfish clinging to her facemask, her suit... 
FLETCHER (O.S.) I can't see, they're smearing the faceplate.  My arms... the fabric... 
Fletcher's suit tears... 
BARNES Fletcher, get away from there... 
FLETCHER (O.S.) It's burning... 
BARNES Get out of there! 
FLETCHER (O.S.) I can't see... 
BARNES Fletcher!  Now! 
FLETCHER (O.S.) I can't... 
ON BETH -- bolting out of the room.  Barnes turning to her... 
BARNES Nobody move. 
BETH But she's -- 
BARNES Nobody move! 
FLETCHER (O.S.) They're eating through... Somebody -- 
CUT TO: 
ON FLETCHER -- UNDERWATER -- jellyfish eating into her plastic faceplate... she's COUGHING, GASPING. 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
They watch... 
Harry: "No" 
"You are a many entity?" 
"No.  We are many separate entities." 
"I understand.  Is there one control entity?" 
BARNES What? 
HARRY He's saying, "Take me to your leader." He wants to know who's in charge. 
BARNES I'm in charge. 
"Yes.  The control entity is Captain Harald Barnes" 
BARNES With an "o".  Harold with an "o". 
HARRY What -- you want me to retype it? 
Harry: "Who are you?" 
"I am one" 
"Where are you from?" 
"I am here" 
"Where is the location from where you began?" 
TED "From where you began?" That's not even good English. 
"I am from AWARENESS" 
BARNES What is that, a planet? 
"Where is AWARENESS?" 
"AWARENESS is" 
"Did you make a journey?" 
"Yes.  Did you make a journey?" 
"Yes" 
"I make a journey.  You make a journey.  We make a journey together.  I am Happy." 
BARNES Great, okay.  Ask him about his weapons. 
NORMAN That's smart.  Let's talk about guns and violence. 
BARNES You don't think weapons are important? 
NORMAN I think we should be careful. Consider his emotional response. 
TED You want to put him on your couch, Norman.  Grill him about his childhood? 
NORMAN When he uses a phrase like "I am Happy", I think we should think twice about what we ask him. 
"Do Not Be Afraid" 
The all stare at the screen, stunned. 
NORMAN Jerry, can you understand what we're saying? 
"Every word" 
Norman walks up to the screen, close to it. 
NORMAN Jerry, can you read our minds? 
"Yes Norman" 
Barnes goes to the intercom... 
BARNES Edmunds, I want you in here.  Now. 
Norman focuses on the screen, staring. 
ON THE SCREEN -- blank. 
Norman concentrating, on the screen. 
THE SCREEN -- blank. 
NORMAN Jerry, are you there? 
"Yes, Norman" 
BARNES We shouldn't talk here.  Shut it off. 
"I do not wish to Intrude" 
NORMAN We would like to talk alone. 
"I do not agree.  That is not possible.  I enjoy to talk with you." 
NORMAN And we enjoy talking with you. 
"Let us talk now" 
NORMAN We'd like to talk with you more.  We admire your talents and your great power and understanding. 
"Thank you" 
NORMAN And in your great understanding, you know that we are entities who must talk in private -- with each other. 
"Do Not Be Afraid" 
NORMAN We're not afraid, we are uncomfortable. 
"Am I offended you?" 
NORMAN Not at all, we enjoy you very much, but we need to talk alone, without you listening. 
"I shall oblige" 
NORMAN Thank you. 
"But I am Not Happy" 
NORMAN Jerry?... 
"We'll be Right Back after a short break for these Messages from our Sponsor" 
NORMAN Has Harry spoken with Jerry? 
TED Not that I know of.  Why? 
INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM 
Norman and Ted at the console... 
NORMAN Jerry? 
No reply. 
NORMAN Jerry, are you there? 
No reply. 
TED You think Jerry has something to do with what killed Edmunds?  With what's out there? 
NORMAN I'm not sure. 
INT.  LABRATORY 
CLOSE ON AN EGG 
Beth, scalpel in hand, is making an incision into the shell. 
BETH Looking at the coating here, it's definitely marine invertebrate. 
Barnes, Norman, Harry and Ted stand around the table. 
BARNES Well, until we know exactly what it is, nobody goes outside, understood? 
TED What was Edmunds doing outside? 
BARNES Resetting the sub. 
TED What sub? 
BARNES In the dome hanger.  All our tapes are transferred to the sub.  It's on a 12 hour timer.  If someone doesn't reset the "delay" button, the sub ascends to the surface with the tapes. 
NORMAN What for? 
BARNES If something should happen to us, the Navy will at least have partial records of what happened. 
NORMAN At least our obituaries will be accurate.  That's reassuring. 
ON THE EGG -- splitting open.  A slimy pinkish-brown FLUID oozes out.  A FETUS underneath. 
They cover their mouths from the smell. 
BARNES What is it? 
Beth picks at it with forceps... 
BETH I'm not sure.  I've never seen anything like it. 
BARNES You're a fucking biochemist, aren't you?  Can't you tell us something. 
Beth glares at Barnes... 
INT.  CLOSET AREA -- DARK 
Beth, holding a piece of paper in her hand, pulls Norman inside, pressing on him... 
BETH ... He lied to us.  He left us down here. 
NORMAN C'mon, Beth.  Don't make this personal.  He told me himself they were taking us back. 
BETH Yeah, he told you.  Think.  What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose?  He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman.  They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out. 
NORMAN So what? 
BETH So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute?  Nobody. 
NORMAN You're jumping to conclusions, Beth. Don't get worked up -- 
BETH Fuck you, Norman!  It's right here... 
She shows him the printout in her hand, putting a flashlight on the words, reads... 
BETH "Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft.  Signed, Barnes, USN." 
NORMAN Where did you get this? 
BETH In Edmunds' things. 
NORMAN You went through Edmunds' things? 
BETH He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon. 
NORMAN Calm down, Beth.  Alright? 
BETH Don't tell me to calm down! 
NORMAN It's done, alright?  It's over!  And there's not a damn thing we can do about it now, okay? 
He turns to leave... 
BETH You said something to him, didn't you? 
NORMAN What? 
BETH You told him about me? 
ON NORMAN -- pausing, staring at her... 
NORMAN Beth -- 
BETH You did, didn't you? 
NORMAN Don't do this. 
BETH You bastard. 
NORMAN Beth, I didn't.  Hold it together. Alright? 
She looks at him, piercing into his eyes... 
BETH Yeah, okay.  Sure, Norman. 
NORMAN Beth -- 
BETH No, I should stay calm.  Like you say.  Right, Norman?  Stay calm. 
Norman looks at her, concerned, knowing she doesn't believe him... 
THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING".  The monitor blinks to BLANK. 
BARNES What the hell? (bangs on the monitors) It shut us down. 
NORMAN Jerry?  Please.  Stop this. 
BARNES Ted, go into the control room. Listen for my instructions. 
Ted goes out the door. 
ALL THE MONITORS -- blank. 
BETH Where is it? 
BARNES Why can't I -- ?  What the hell is going on here? 
They HEAR a metallic CLANKING. 
BETH What was that? 
BARNES He's right beneath us. 
THE MONITORS blink: "I AM HERE". 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LABRATORY 
Harry looking at the FETUS on the table.  It suddenly SLIDES down the table. 
The room is rocked. 
ON SHELVES -- Jars, petry dishes, test tubes SLIDE off shattering to the floor. 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
BANG! 
TED is thrown ruthlessly against the wall.  His HEAD striking metal, splitting open his forehead. 
THE WALLS -- CRACKING and GROANING. 
WATER breaks through a crack, spreading out onto the floor. 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
Barnes... 
BARNES Ted?  Ted? 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM 
Ted, stumbles, reaches for the headset... 
TED Sir, we're leaking! 
Blood dripping from his forehead. 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
BARNES Increase positive pressure! 
BETH That's our reserve air. 
BARNES It's either that or we grow gills. 
BANG!  They grip onto the console... 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM 
Ted, drousy, BLOOD gushing from his head, keeping balance, searches for the PRESSURE GAGE. 
BARNES (O.S.) Ted?  Ted, are you with me? 
Finds the GAGE.  Turns it. 
TED Increasing positive pressure. 
EXT.  HABITAT -- UNDERWATER 
AIR BUBBLES burst out of the walls. 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
ON THE FLOOR -- the WATER scurrying back through the leaks in the wall. 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
Barnes, watching the monitors. 
BARNES That's enough Ted. (beat) Shut it off! 
INT.  CONTROL RROM 
THE PRESSURE GAGE -- the needle RISING... 
ON THE HEADSET -- in the air, dangling from it's cord. 
BARNES (O.S.) Ted?  Ted! 
ON TED -- passed out on the floor.  Blood covering his face. 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
Beth and Norman BOLT out the door 
INTO THE HALLWAY 
Running.  BANG!  They're thrown against the wall. 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM 
THE PRESSURE GAUGE -- rising, higher, higher. 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
THUMP!  Norman and Beth, losing their balance, stumbling to their feet, running... 
ON TED -- SLIDING out of the Control Room, down the corridor, taken by the water. 
Beth grabs him, as Norman stumbles 
INTO THE CONTROL ROOM 
finds the PRESSURE GAGE, shuts it off. 
ON BETH -- cold, turns away. 
INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM 
FIRE blasts out from the wall... 
BETH and NORMAN (still with Ted) wearing GAS MASKS, RUSH into the room... 
BETH Stay low! 
Beth sprays WHITE FOAM on the fierce FLAMES, licking up the side padding, smoke boils to the cieling. 
BANG!  The room is rocked. 
NORMAN It won't stop. 
Norman falls to the floor, losing Ted. 
TED -- SLIDES away and UNDER the computer CONSOLE. 
BANG!  The computer CONSOLE breaks -- COMPUTERS, MONITORS, fall, CRUSHING on Ted's legs.  He SCREAMS out in agony. 
NORMAN scrambles towards him through the smoke when... 
THE CONSOLE catches fire, erupts in flame.  Ted underneath it. 
BETH -- her extinguisher out of foam. 
NORMAN -- runs to a wall, finds an EXTINGUISHER CASING, it's been bent, can't get it open. 
TED -- reaches out in desperation as his LEGS catch fire. 
TED Norman! 
NORMAN -- BASHES the casing in with his shoulder, grabs the extinguisher, turns... 
TED -- his entire body on fire. 
BANG!  Norman falls, dropping the extinguisher -- it rolls across the floor.  He reaches out -- can't get it. 
CLOSE ON TED -- his face burning... 
TED Norman!  Nor-- 
BANG!  The lights go out. 
DARKNESS 
NORMAN -- watches in horror as he watches TED, lit in flame, burning to death. 
NORMAN -- reaches for the wall for balance, grabs METAL, and he's ELECTRICUTED.  Falls backward, head first, and EVERYTHING GOES... 
BLACK 
A long beat. 
NAVY SEAMAN (O.S.) Dr. Johnson?  Dr. Johnson? 
INT.  COMMUNICATIONS ROOM 
WE FOCUS in on Norman, as he awakens.  NAVY SEAMAN, 40s, African- American, standing above him. 
NAVY SEAMAN Norman Johnson. 
NORMAN Does this mean what I think it means? 
NAVY SEAMAN It's over, sir, The storm has cleared. 
NORMAN The ships? 
NAVY SEAMAN (O.S.) They're topside.  We're ready to take you home, sir. 
The Navy Seaman helps Norman to his feet.  Norman is smiling, it's over. 
INT.  HALLWAY 
Norman and the Navy Seaman walk down the hall. 
NORMAN How are the others? 
NAVY SEAMAN The others, sir? 
NORMAN Beth and Harry? 
NAVY SEAMAN They're in the sub, sir.  Waiting. 
Norman sighs, smiling.  The relief, the jubilation. 
NORMAN That whole time -- I couldn't stop thinking of what Harry was saying earlier... 
NAVY SEAMAN What was that, sir? 
NORMAN About the time paradox. (the Seaman nodding) How we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- 
As Norman looks up, the Navy Seaman, still walking and nodding, begins to slowly DISAPPEAR.  Disintigrating.  VANISHING before his eyes. 
Norman stops, looks around him.  He's gone. 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
Norman watches on a monitor -- the VIDEO of him walking down the hall, the Navy Seaman walking next to him. 
NORMAN (O.S.) ... how we were all going to die -- that there was no way we would make it out of here alive -- 
ON THE MONITOR -- the Seaman disappers. 
Norman stops tape.  Looks over at the MONITOR showing the SPHERE.  It is closed. 
THE SCREEN goes BLACK.  Flashes up: "Hello Norman" 
NORMAN Jerry? 
"Yes Norman" 
NORMAN Jerry, did you create that man? 
"The entity Navy Seaman was a Manifestation.  Did you have a Happy talk?" 
NORMAN Jerry, are you manifesting what's destroying our habitat? 
"Did you have a Happy talk?" 
NORMAN Jerry, answer me. 
"No." 
A VIDEO SCREEN with the choices: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE, SHUTDOWN... " 
THUMP! 
The sub slightly SWAYS. 
Norman sits still, nervous. 
THUMP!  Harder this time. 
Norman looks through the GLASS WINDSHIELD.  Sweating.  Can't see anything in here. 
BANG!  It SWAYS faster, harder, back and forth.  He grips the seat. 
NORMAN Beth!  Beth!  There's something -- ! 
THUMP!  BANG!  He's thrown around in the sub.  He can't see anything, tosses around.  He reaches for the doorhandle. 
BANG!  He looses grip, his legs fly up in the air.  The Sub almost turns over on it's side. 
NORMAN Beth!  Shit! 
His HELMET BANGS into the glass, WE SEE his look of terror.  Water SPLASHING up from below. 
Then, EVERYTHING stops. 
The sub SWAYS to a still.  He sits quietly.  Waiting.  Listening. 
Reaches for the doorhandle, cautiously climbs out. 
Stands on top of the sub.  Keeping balance.  He looks around, finds a DOOR inside the dome.  Tries to open it.  Locked. 
Looks around.  Nothing else.  Looks down at the water.  Can he risk it? His BREATHING short. 
NORMAN Beth?  Can you hear me? 
No reply.  He dips his leg slowly, quietly into the water.  Grimacing. Then, cautiously slips down into the water... 
EXT.  UNDERWATER 
CLOSE ON HIS FACE -- terrified.  Looking everywhere.  Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  Lands on the bottom. 
His LIFE SUPPORT BADGE beeping.  Shortness of BREATH. 
He walks, trying to run, out from under the dome hanger.  The DARK WATER.  Can't see anything.  Scared to death. 
NORMAN Beth?  Beth?  Shit. 
THE HABITAT -- ahead of him. 
Norman goes to a STANCHION.  Grips onto it.  Twists around.  Looking. Searching.  Doesn't see anything.  LIFE SUPPORT BADGE bleeping faster. Barely BREATHING. 
HARRY (O.S.) ... you there?  Norman? 
NORMAN Harry? 
HARRY (O.S.) Norman, where are you? 
NORMAN I can't breathe...  Am I... clear? 
HARRY (O.S.) You're clear.  You see the airlock? 
Norman, twists around, and as he does... 
A SEA SNAKE 
HISSES at his faceplate.  Norman SCREAMS. 
ON HIS HAND -- holding the snake, not the girder, lets go. 
HARRY (O.S.) Norman! 
Norman falls... looking up: The SNAKE wrapped around the STANCHION, slithering between the grid-like posts. 
THE SNAKE'S HEAD comes at Norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom. Backpeddaling on his arms and feet.  THE SNAKE, HISSING, coming at him. It's long TONGUE flicking at him, inches from his faceplate.  Norman backpeddaling, can't BREATHE, the SNAKE coming down on him, Norman falls on his back, the TONGUE WHIPPING across his faceplate, when... 
NORMAN is whisked up. 
HARRY has him by the collar of his suit.  Taking him up. 
INT.  AIRLOCK 
They burst out of the water.  Harry throws Norman onto the floor. Unhooks his helmet -- Norman BREATHES, fast and furious. 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Norman, panting, walks with Harry... 
NORMAN Thank you.  My suit -- Beth said she fixed it -- 
HARRY What happened to her? 
NORMAN What do you mean?  She's not here? 
HARRY When I woke up, nobody was here. 
NORMAN She was supposed to be watching the sensor for me. 
HARRY Her suit's gone. 
NORMAN Beth left? 
HARRY I thought she was with you. 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
Norman and Harry at the mic... 
BETH (O.S.) ... what do you mean?  I'm in the ship. 
NORMAN What are you doing in the ship? (beat) Beth? 
BETH (O.S.) Getting food.  We were out of food. what's wrong?  You sound mad. 
NORMAN Yeah, well, I get that way when I'm facing death and someone deserts me. 
BETH (O.S.) Deserts you?  Harry said he'd take over for me. 
NORMAN He what? 
Harry shakes his head: "no way". 
BETH (O.S.) When he woke up, he said we were out of food.  He told me to get some from the ship. 
HARRY I never said that. 
NORMAN "Our fisherman frequently see some that are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of squids... 
BETH Squids? 
NORMAN "... according to calculations of some naturalists, one of these animals, only six feet long, would have tentacles 27 feet long.  That would make a formidable monster." 
He looks up from the book, realizing something... 
BETH Norman? 
SNAPS the book closed. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LIVING QUARTERS 
CLOSE ON HARRY'S DUFFLEBAG -- Norman rifles through notebooks.  Turning pages. 
TEARS off the first Jerry transmission. 
Beth, standing at the doorway, keeping watch down the hall. 
BETH Norman, what is it? 
Norman grabs Harry's YELLOW PAD OF PAPER. 
CUT TO: 
THEIR FEET -- scurrying through the water soaked corridor. 
Norman ushers her into the Control Room.  Looks around.  SHUTS the door. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CONTROL ROOM 
Norman SCRIBBLES on the printout, glancing at the yellow pad of paper... 
NORMAN After the attack, a Navy guy woke me up -- I don't know -- I thought he was an illusion.  But I checked the tape, and Jerry said he manifested him. 
BETH Manifested? 
NORMAN Created.  Brought to life.  I don't know.  But at the end, Jerry said, "Stop calling me Jerry".  And -- 
Norman stops, staring at the pad. 
NORMAN He translated it wrong. 
BETH What? 
Norman picks up the pad of paper, reads... 
NORMAN Hello.  How are you?  I am fine.  What is your name?...  My name is Harry. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Harry is walking towards the Living Quarters... 
NORMAN (O.S.) Remember when we first spoke to Jerry, Barnes kept asking for Jerry's real name?  But Harry never would?  He didn't because he was afraid the screen would say "Harry", instead of Jerry.  We weren't talking to an alien intelligence when we talked to Jerry, we were talking to Harry... or a part of Harry. 
BETH (O.S.) What do you mean, a part of Harry? 
BACK IN -- CONTROL ROOM 
NORMAN When did the messages start?  The animals outside start showing up? After Harry came out of the sphere. 
BETH You think, in the sphere -- 
NORMAN He acquired some sort of power.  A power to manifest things. 
BETH But how? 
NORMAN I don't know. 
BETH How can the sphere do that? 
NORMAN I don't know, Beth.  I'm not the fucking alien that built the thing. But it can.  When Harry came out of the sphere, he mumbled something about page 87.  How he would never read that far -- he was too scared to.  Then you found the book, remember in your lab.  Then in the cafeteria -- and page 87 talks about a giant squid... 
BETH Which I told Barnes was attacking -- 
NORMAN It's his fear.  The squid.  He's manifesting his fears.  Making them real. 
BETH But why is he doing it? 
NORMAN He must not realize he is.  Like the Navy crewman -- Harry was sleeping then.  He must've manifested his dream. 
BETH His dream?  You can't control your dreams.  And you can't control your fears, can you? 
NORMAN (shaking his head) No.  I mean, we've always believed we can think anything we want without consequences.  You ever read the Bible? (off her look) It talks about our sinful nature, you know?  I mean, we can think, and believe, and desire whatever we want, but there's a part of us -- a shadow side, as Jung called it -- that can't be controlled.  It's evil. It's inside us.  It's what we are. 
CUT TO: 
IN -- THE LIVING QUARTERS 
It's dark.  Harry lies on his bunk, asleep. 
BETH (O.S.) And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested. 
NORMAN (O.S.) Must be.  And if it is -- it's a part of him not even he can control. 
Harry opens his eyes, stares at us. 
WE BEGIN TO HEAR A LOW INSISTENT BEEPING... 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
ON SCREEN -- a transmission comes across... 
"CQX VDX MOP LKI... " 
Beth and Norman watch... 
NORMAN Looks like some sort of code. 
BETH Why would Harry go back to using a code? 
HARRY (O.S.) You mean Jerry, don't you? 
Harry leaning against the doorframe, enters the room. 
BETH Jerry.  Right.  I said Jerry, didn't I? 
HARRY That's a hell of a mistake to make, Beth. 
NORMAN It's like a sleeping pill? 
BETH "... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... " 
Norman digs, finds paracin trichloride... 
NORMAN Here we go. 
CUT TO: 
BETH -- mixing the medicines... 
NORMAN (O.S.) (reading from the computer) "20 cc's of parasolutrine in combination with 6 cc's of paracin given IV produces deep sleep suitable for emergency surgical procedures... no cardiac side effects ... REM activity is surpressed... " 
BETH How long does it last? 
NORMAN Three to six hours. 
BETH I'll just boost the doses. 
NORMAN What?  Wait -- isn't that dangerous? 
BETH How fast does it take effect? 
NORMAN Doesn't say. 
BETH What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour?  And he can fight it off?  We can't afford that. 
Beth goes to the cabinet, grabs another medicine.  Norman comes over as she adds it to the mix... 
NORMAN What is that?  What are you doing? What do you want to do -- kill him? 
A beat... 
BETH It's an idea. 
NORMAN Beth -- 
BETH To be on the safe side.  I mean -- 
NORMAN You want to kill him? 
BETH Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place. 
She fills the LARGE SYRINGE with the clear liquid mix. 
BETH You ever given an injection before. 
NORMAN Thirty years ago.  In residency.  I passed out.  You? 
BETH Only lab rats.  Here. 
She hands him the syringe... 
BETH Give him the whole thing.  Hurry, before he wakes up. 
Norman looks at the syringe, like it's an assault rifle. 
NORMAN Where do I stick it? 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LIVING QUARTERS 
Harry sleeps on his bunk.  The door to the room is closed. 
INT.  CAFETERIA 
Norman spirals down the stairway from the lab.  Hurrying through the dark cafeteria, the syringe at his side. 
INTO THE HALLWAY 
shuffling down the corridor, nervously.  Glancing at the syringe. 
ROUNDS A CORNER 
and SEES in front of the Living Quarters... 
TWO AFRICAN-AMERICAN NAVY CREWMEN -- standing guard of the door. 
Norman stops, hides behind the wall. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LABRATORY 
Norman comes in... 
NORMAN He's got Farrakahn's army standing guard.  What's plan B? 
Suddenly, BANG!  The room shakes.  Shelves fall.  Cabinet doors swing open.  Norman falls to the floor. 
THE COMPUTER MONITOR -- crashes down in front of his face.  It reads: "I WILL KILL YOU ALL" 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Norman and Beth running... 
BETH Harry! 
BANG!  Water shoots through the wall.  Gushing out onto the floor.  The walls CRACKING. 
ON HARRY -- running out of his room... 
HARRY What is it? 
NORMAN You know what it is, Harry. 
BANG!  They lose their balance, still running... 
NORMAN It's the squid!  Stop it! 
HARRY Stop what?  What are you -- ? 
BANG!  Another CRACK -- water gushing inside. 
NORMAN You know damn well what.  You're doing it! 
Norman grabs Harry, pushes him up against the wall. 
HARRY Doing what?  I'm not doing anything -- ! 
Beth takes the syringe from her palm, and STABS Harry in the SHOULDER. 
HE SCREAMS IN HORRIFYING PAIN, FADING OVER INTO... 
NORMAN And whatever it is, it's not coming from Harry. 
Norman looks at the monitors: 
ON AN OUTSIDE CAMERA FEED -- a bright LIGHT blinds the SCREEN.  It's Beth in the sub, moving along the habitat. 
The Sub's CLAW ARMS carry large RED BOXES.  The lettering on the boxes isn't in focus. 
Norman squints at the MONITOR -- can't make it out. 
NORMAN Beth?  What is that?  What are you doing? 
The Sub's CLAW ARMS drops one of the BOXES, plumping it softly on the muddy floor. 
NORMAN Can you hear me?  Beth?  Can you copy? Get inside, there's something out there. 
ON ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub moves forward.  Churning up the sediment. It stops again, and releases another box. 
Norman BANGS on the headset. 
NORMAN Damn it, Beth, I know you hear me. 
THE MONITORS blink: "I AM COMING FOR YOU" 
ON NORMAN -- breathing heavy. 
NORMAN What the hell? 
ANOTHER MONITOR -- the Sub in view -- a closer view.  It releases it's last box.  Norman can read the lettering now: "CAUTION: TEVAC EXPLOSIVES" 
NORMAN Beth?  C'mon.  What are you -- ? 
THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU" 
NORMAN Oh shit. 
Norman WHIPS off his headset, bursts out of his seat, OPENS a CABINET. Searching for tapes.  Another cabinet.  Then another. 
A shelf labled: "SPHERE" -- all the tapes are gone. 
NORMAN It's her. 
THE MONITORS flash: "I WILL KILL YOU" 
ON THE HEADSET -- resting on the console.  WE HEAR faintly... 
BETH (O.S.) Norman?  Norman? 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Norman pushes Harry and his IV down the corridor.  Hurrying.  An inch or two of water on the floor. 
INT.  LIVING QUARTERS 
CLOSE ON A METAL CASE -- labled: "Captain Harold Barnes." 
Norman BANGS it against the wall, trying to bust the LOCK.  BANGING. BANGING.  Breaks the lock.  Digs inside the case. 
Pulls out a GUN. 
INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR 
Norman pushing Harry and the IV stand.  Wheels him into... 
BATHROOM/SINK AREA 
Norman stops.  Turns off the main lights.  The room goes dark.  The florescent LIGHT above the sinks stay on. 
Norman wheels Harry inside, places him by a wall.  Checks the IV. 
Norman goes to a STALL.  Steps inside.  Keeps the stall door open.  Can still see Harry about 10 feet away. 
Norman looks at the GUN.  COCKS it.  Pinches his finger. 
NORMAN Ouch. 
He waits.  Listening. 
A FAINT HIGH-PITCHED HISSING SOUND 
Norman looks over at the sinks. 
A FAUCET is on.  Water HISSING faintly from it. 
Norman ignores it.  Waiting in the dark.  Listening. 
ON THE FAUCET -- the water running. 
ON NORMAN -- looking at it.  Can't ignore it.  Tries.  But can't. 
Norman walks quietly through the inch of water on the floor. 
OVER TO THE SINKS 
The light above them on.  Norman turns the faucet off.  The water stops. 
But the HISSING SOUND remains. 
Norman looks at the faucet, queerly.  Turns it back on.  Then off. 
The HISSING SOUND still there.  It isn't the water. 
Norman looks down at his feet... 
THE FLOOR -- seems to be moving.  Something swimming in the water. 
CLOSE ON NORMAN'S PANTLEG -- a long, tubular SEA SNAKE slithers up inside his pantleg, HISSING.  His pants BULGING as the SNAKE slowly slides up past his knee. 
HISSING LOUDER 
As more SNAKES comes through the crack in the wall. 
NORMAN watches with horror in the mirror in front of him as the SNAKE slithers up to his groin, and across the inside of his shirt. 
Another SNAKE begins WRAPPING itself around the outside of Norman, sliding up around his neck. 
WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS COME FROM DOWN THE HALL 
NORMAN, standing still, watches as more SNAKES crawl up his sides, slithering around his arms, his shoulders, his neck, under his chin, over his face.  Their forked tongues FLICKING and HISSING. 
BETH (O.S.) What time is it, Norman? 
NORMAN looking in the MIRROR -- as Beth comes up behind him in her jumpsuit. 
BETH Do you know the time? 
BETH Did I?  Or was that you? (beat) When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you?  Terrified.  Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor.  You did that, Norman. 
NORMAN You're insane. 
BETH Am I?  Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane? 
NORMAN I never went in that sphere. 
BETH You don't remember you did.  But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you?  You remember that. 
NORMAN Yes. 
BETH You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened? (off his look) That's right.  But you can't remember going inside, can you?  No, of course not.  Harry couldn't either, could he?  "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said. 
NORMAN That's bullshit. 
BETH Is it? 
NORMAN Beth, the message said Harry.  "My name is Harry".  My name isn't Harry. 
BETH No, it isn't.  Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name?  The one who was stung when you were younger.  The one that died. The one you couldn't save.  What was his name? (imitating) "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman.  I'm scared." "C'mon, Harry, it'll be fine, it'll be fun." (resuming) You heartless fuck.  That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it? 
NORMAN Shut up, Beth -- 
BETH When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking?  Do you know?  "I can't get Beth on the radio.  I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean.  All alone.  Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears?  You never really saw what it was, did you? 
Norman stares up at her, frightened.  Is she right? 
BETH I'm not scaring you, am I Norman?  I hope I'm not frightening you.  The last thing I want to do is frighten you.  You feel okay, don't you? 
NORMAN It's not me, Beth.  I swear.  It can't be. 
BETH "It's not me, Beth.  It's not me.  It can't be.  I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle. 
Norman looks at her palm -- SEES the NEEDLE in her hand.  Norman backs up, away. 
NORMAN Don't, Beth. 
BETH But I have to, Norman. 
NORMAN I promise -- 
BETH Promise what, Norman?  Tell me! 
NORMAN Beth -- 
BETH You think I'd belive you?  Believe anything you might say now?  After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past.  About my problems.  My problems.  Not yours.  Not his.  Mine. 
NORMAN Don't, Beth.  Please. 
BETH It's either this... or I kill you. 
The GUN in her other hand. 
NORMAN Beth -- 
She comes at him, needle in hand... 
BETH It's your choice.  Because it's not safe for you to be awake.  To be walking around.  To be thinking about things. 
NORMAN It's not safe for you to be either. 
BETH You think I care?  You think I care if I die? (almost laughing) Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself?  Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time?  I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you.  Your safety. Protecting you from your own self. 
She lunges at him with the needle, missing.  He RUNS for the SPIRAL STAIRCASE leading to the lab.  Norman grabs the handrail, begins climbing the stairs. 
Beth's at his feet, grabbing for his ankles. 
BETH Norman!  I'm doing this for you, Norman. 
He frantically crawls up the stairs, her grasping at his heels. 
BETH Norman. 
Climbing, climbing -- round and round -- the STAIRS never seem to end. He looks up: 
THE STAIRS -- expanding in front of him, strangely increasing in number.  He climbs, racing, PANTING.  Beth, right behind him, laughing almost. 
BETH Come here, Norman. 
She GRABS his ANKLE.  She raises the NEEDLE.  Norman turns, KICKS her in the FACE. 
She WAILS, blood SPITTING from her nose. 
Climbing, climbing.  The STAIRS increasing above.  He LUNGES for the top step, GRABS it.  Pulls himself up... 
INTO THE LAB 
Scrambling.  He stares down at Beth -- the GUN pointing at him. 
BETH Norman -- 
He SLAMS the HATCH DOOR, on top of her, BASHING her head down.  He holds the DOOR closed.  Trying to regain his breath. 
BETH (O.S.) This is what I'm talking about, Norman.  Don't you see?  It's in you. This vindictiveness.  This rage. 
NORMAN Get away from the door, Beth. 
He slides a heavy FILE CABINET over on top of the door. 
BETH (O.S.) Oh, Norman, I don't want to come in... 
The door's METAL PIVOT turns... 
CUT TO: 
ON BETH -- on the stairs, spinning the door's WHEEL... 
BETH ... I want to lock you in. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  LABRATORY 
Norman staring at the wheel.  CLICK!  It's locked from the outside.

CUT TO: 
INT.  AIRLOCK 
... His head BURSTS above the water level, BIG BREATH.  GASPING.  He flails his arms over to the ladder.  Grips the ladder, but his hands are like ice.  Can't hold it.  He slips. 
Flailing in the water. 
He HEAVES his chest over the METAL RIM.  Twists his legs around, out of the water, and flops his body onto the deck. 
Shivering. 
Tries to get up.  Falls over.  His body shaking.  His lips purple.  His eyes barely open, looking at... 
HIS JUMPSUIT -- hanging on the wall. 
Norman crawls toward the suit, his body shaking violently.  He reaches out for his boots on the floor.  Can't grip them.  Inches his HEAD toward his suit, tries to BITE at his suit, but his TEETH chattering. 
BETH (O.S.) I know what you're doing, Norman. But you can't save yourself. 
He grips the wall, his hands pulling him up.  He RIPS his suit off the hanger. 
BETH (O.S.) It's over, Norman.  It's all over. 
Slipping on his suit, he HEARS a MAN'S voice... 
MAN (O.S.) Your attention, please.  Your attention, please.  All construction personnel clear the blast area now. Tevac explosives are now activated. Countdown beginning.  Mark 15 minutes, and counting.

Norman turns, dives back in the water. 
CUT TO: 
UNDERWATER 
Norman swims out from under the habitat.  Looks around at the cylinders, the walls. 
Goes to the outside of a WALL.  Looking for a CRACK, a LEAK, a way in. 
TO HIS LEFT -- Barnes' body, floating, hooked to the wall. 
Norman goes to him.  SEES the CRACK. 
Climbing inside.  Struggling through the CRACK, careful not to rip his suit. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Flooded to the top with water.  Completely filled.  Norman emerges through the crack.  MOVES down the hall. 
A BOX OF CORN FLAKES 
floats by his faceplate. 
BETH (O.S.) Norman, where are you?  I can't see you, Norman.  Tell me where you are. 
Norman pulls at the cylinder's HATCH DOOR.  He HEARS faintly through his helmet... 
MAN (O.S.) Twelve minutes, and counting. 
He OPENS the door.  Slips inside, the water going with him.

EXT.  UNDERWATER 
UNDERNEATH THE SUB'S DOME HANGER 
Norman tries to climb up the ladder with Beth on his back.  She falls off, deadweight to the ground. 
NORMAN Shit. (picking her up) Harry!  I'm gonna have to lift her up to you. 
Harry leans down from the Sub's airlock... 
HARRY Alright.  Hurry. 
Norman pushes her up to him, but she bends at the waist. 
HARRY I can't reach her. 
NORMAN Hold on. 
Norman flops her up in the air, but she bends again at the waist. 
HARRY Push her, c'mon. 
NORMAN I'm trying.  Shit.  Here -- catch her. 
He flops her up again.

Picking her up...

NORMAN Shut up and catch. 
Norman flops her up once more, and Harry grabs her AIR HOSE. 
HARRY I got her.  I got her. 
Harry pulls her toward the airlock, Norman climbs up after. 
INT.  SUB AIRLOCK 
The pocket of air around the sub.  The three of them crammed inside. Norman opens the door on top of the sub. 
NORMAN Alright, here, I'll... wait, you -- just give her to me. 
Norman takes Beth and pushes her on top the sub.  The sub sways back and forth. 
HARRY Norman, what are you -- 
They lose balance, Beth almost falls, Norman catches her. 
NORMAN Shit.  Alright, Harry, get in there. 
Harry jumps on top of the sub.  Slides inside it.  Reaches his arms out, catching Beth's legs. 
MAN (O.S.) Three minutes and counting... 
NORMAN Take her, come on.  Just -- 
Beth's LEG swings up and hits Harry in the helmet. 
HARRY C'mon, Norman! 
NORMAN I'm trying to keep balance with -- 
HARRY Gimme a second -- 
NORMAN Just pull her -- down like inside -- Harry, work with me here! 
HARRY Her legs are in the way. 
NORMAN You got her? 
Harry pulls Beth down inside, as Norman steps on top of the sub, helps push Beth's head inside. 
NORMAN Get her out of the seat, I need room to sit.  Harry? 
HARRY I'm trying.  There. 
MAN (O.S.) Two minutes-thirty and counting. 
Norman drops inside.

NORMAN No idea. 
HARRY Well, press something! 
NORMAN Wait! 
MAN (O.S.) Two minutes and counting. 
HARRY How long did you say -- 
NORMAN Shut up.  Let me think. 
Norman presses a button. 
THE SCREEN -- blinks: "DESCEND, ASCEND, SECURE, SHUTDOWN... " 
Norman hits "ASCEND".  The Sub WHIRRS, RUMBLES and drops down below. 
Norman works the steering wheel, gliding it upwards.

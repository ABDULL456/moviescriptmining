Fills the screen. Falling from the top of frame to the bottom. Pluming off into dust. White, white, white. We move toward it even as it recedes, always out of reach. Finally we pop out wide and high to reveal... 
The white is chalk. An old BLACK GROUNDSKEEPER lays down the right field line on a baseball diamond. 
1 INT. BRANCH RICKEY'S OFFICE - MONTAGUE ST, BROOKLYN - DAY 1 
Blinds closed. Dust motes in the air. A large GOLDFISH TANK bubbles. BRANCH RICKEY at his desk. Two photos on the wall: Abe Lincoln & Leo Durocher. CHALKBOARDS covered with 100's OF NAMES, every player in the Dodger organization. 
CLYDE SUKEFORTH and HAROLD PARROTT sit across from Rickey who stares at them. Sukeforth stares back. Parrott nervous. 
RICKEY Gentlemen, I have a plan... As of now, only the Board of Directors and my family know. 
Sukeforth and Parrott exchange a look. 
SUKEFORTH A plan's always good, Mr. Rickey. And you always got one. 
RICKEY My wife says I'm too old, That my health isn't up to it. My son says that every one in baseball will be against me. But I'm going to do it. 
Parrott looks to Sukeforth who keeps his eyes on Rickey. 
SUKEFORTH Do what, Mr. Rickey? 
RICKEY I'm going to bring a Negro ballplayer to the Brooklyn Dodgers. 
PARROTT With all due respect, sir, have you lost your mind? Imagine the abuse you'll take from the newspapers alone. Never mind how it'll play on Flatbush. Please, Mr. Rickey. 
Rickey looks dismissively at Parrott, over to Sukeforth. 
PINK REV 4-19-12 1A. 
RICKEY There's no law against it, Clyde. 
SUKEFORTH There's a code. Break a law and get away with it, some people think you're smart. Break an unwritten law though, you'll be an outcast. 
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 2. 
RICKEY So be it. New York is full of Negro baseball fans; every dollar is green. I don't know who he is, or where he is, but he's coming.

2 EXT. RICKWOOD FIELD - BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA - NIGHT 2 
The big Birmingham Black Barons CATCHER behind the plate as Kansas City Monarchs JOHN SCOTT stands at bat. The catcher's attention on the RUNNER DANCING off first. Stomping a foot, feinting, hard to see clearly in the glare of the lights. 
CATCHER Where'd you learn to move like that, runner?! At dime a dance night?! Stay quiet! INSERT: Birmingham, Alabama. April 8, 1945. On the first pitch the runner takes off. The catcher fires to second. See it from his POV as the runner slides in âSAFE!â A foot on the bag, the runner dusts off, heckles the catcher: 
RUNNER Is that the best you got?! Huh?! I'm going to steal nine, ten bases today! You better start counting! The catcher frowns. Standing, we see he is a big, big man. 
CATCHER 
(ALABAMAN) Where's your shortstop from? 
JOHN SCOTT 
(LOUISIANAN) California. 
CATCHER He's got a mouth on him. Shaking his head, the catcher gets back in his crouch, signals the PITCHER. On the wind-up, the Runner is off again. The catcher fires to THIRD: âSafe!â 
RUNNER You got a rag arm, catcher! 
CATCHER Steal home! You'll find out what kind of arm I got! 
DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 3. 
RUNNER Okay, I'm coming! The Catcher looks over at Scott who chuckles. 
CATCHER California, huh? 
(SCOTT NODS) Well California here he goes, if he comes down here. The Catcher gets back down in his squat. Signals the pitcher: fastball. Scott digs in, ready. The runner dancing off third. Here comes the wind-up... The Runner takes off even as the pitcher fires it in. The Birmingham Catcher receives it. As the Runner slides -- The Catcher intentionally drives his glove, the ball and both hands into the runner's face -- WHALLOP! Sound drops as we're knocked flat senseless along with the runner. ON HIM now as he tries to push himself up from the dirt. A close look at JACK ROOSEVELT ROBINSON. A born battler, he shakes out the cobwebs, finally lurches to his feet, looks to the UMPIRE. He never heard the call. 
JACK What was I? The umpire passes one hand over the other: Safe. Jack looks over at the catcher, gives him a pointed look as he goes -- The catcher shoves him in the back. Jack turns, shoves back. As the two men wrestles each other to the ground --

8 INT. BRANCH RICKEY'S OFFICE - MONTAGUE ST, BROOKLYN - DAY 8 
Blinds closed. Jack sits across the desk from Rickey. Sukeforth sits a little further back. Rickey is staring at Jack. Bushy eyebrows flared, light gleams off his glasses. INSERT: August 28, 1945. Brooklyn. Jack doesn't know what to do, looks to Sukeforth. Finally... 
RICKEY Do you have a girl? 
JACK Excuse me? 
RICKEY A man needs a family relying on him. It insures he'll behave responsibly. Do you have a girl? 
JACK I think so. 
RICKEY You think so? Jack looks to Sukeforth who smiles placidly. Back to Rickey. 
WHITE 3-14-12 8. 
JACK I don't make much money. Between the army and now baseball I've been away a lot. And Rae, Rachel, she wants to finish school. Considering all that, I say I think so. 
RICKEY Do you love her? Rachel? 
(JACK CONFUSED) Don't you know? 
JACK Yes, sir, very much. 
RICKEY Marry her. What? Rickey stands, walks to a window. Jack looks at Sukeforth who raises a hand as if to say: Give it a chance. 
RICKEY (CONT'D) Baseball's a hard life; a man needs a good woman by his side. You don't want the only person waiting for you at home to be a catcher. Sukeforth chuckles at that. Rickey fingers open a slat on the blind and peers out. Jack looks hard at him. 
JACK Coach Sukeforth here said you were starting a new Negro League. That doesn't make sense to me. 
MR. RICKEY It doesn't, huh? Are you calling us liars, Jack? 
JACK What's this about, Mr. Rickey? 
RICKEY This is about baseball. Rickey opens the shade. Sunlight floods in. Rickey follows it to the chalkboard, to the list of players under Montreal. 
RICKEY (CONT'D) I see you starting in the spring with our affiliate in Montreal. If you make it there, we'll try you down here with the Dodgers. The white Brooklyn Dodgers. Jack looks to Sukeforth who nods: Yes, you heard right. 
BLUE REV 4-07-12 9. 
RICKEY (CONT'D) I'll pay you $600 a month and a $3,500 bonus when you sign the contract. Is that agreeable? Believe it or not that's a lot of money to Jack on this day in time. This is all becoming a bit overwhelming. 
JACK Yes, sir. That's fine. 
RICKEY There is one condition. I have a pile of scouting reports. I know you can hit behind the runner, that you can read a pitch. The question is can you control your temper? 
JACK My temper? 
RICKEY Yes your temper! Are you deaf?! Rickey furious, the avuncular old man gone. Jack sits there, fists now balled. Rickey to Sukeforth like he's not there: 
RICKEY (CONT'D) He looks proud. Willful. 
SUKEFORTH He'll need to be. Rickey looks back to Jack who is as angry as he is confused. 
RICKEY I want to win! I want ballplayers who can win! Are you one of them?! 
JACK Yes. 
RICKEY A black man in white baseball. Imagine the reaction. The vitriol. Rickey strides forward, gets in his face. 
RICKEY (CONT'D) The Dodgers check into a hotel. A decent good hotel. You're worn out from the road and some clerk won't give you the pen to sign in. 
(SOUTHERN DRAWL) We got no room, boy, not even down in the coal bin where you belong. 
BLUE REV 4-07-12 10. Jack looks like he wants to tear Rickey apart. 
RICKEY (CONT'D) The team stops at a restaurant. The waiter won't take your order. (adopts a new voice) Didn't you see the sign on the door? No animals allowed. 
(LOOMING) What are you going to do then? Fight him? Ruin all my plans? Answer me, you black sonofabitch! 
JACK 
(MASTERS HIMSELF) Do you want a ballplayer who doesn't have the guts to fight back? Is that what you want? 
RICKEY I want one who has the guts not to fight back! There are people who will not like this. They will do anything to get you to react. If you echo a curse with a curse, they will only hear yours. Follow a blow with a blow and they will say a Negro lost his temper; that the Negro does not belong. Your enemy will be out in force, but you can not meet him on his own low ground. We win with hitting, running and fielding, nothing else. We win if the world is convinced of two things: that you are a fine gentlemen and a great ballplayer. Like our Savior, you must have the guts to turn the other cheek. Jack considers Rickey. Rickey looks worn out. 
RICKEY (CONT'D) Can you do it? Jack poised at what will be his Rubicon. He crosses. 
JACK Mr. Rickey, you give me a uniform, you give me a number on my back, and I'll give you the guts.

SMITH Yes, a sentimental one. I'm from Detroit. He was the Tiger shortstop when I was a boy. How about you? Who's your best? 
RICKEY Pop Lloyd. 
SMITH Not Honus Wagner? 
RICKEY Wagner is number two. And Rabbit Tavener would not break my top 25. Where do you suppose Jackie Robinson will end up on that list? 
SMITH He won't break it. He doesn't have a shortstop's arm. Robinson belongs on second base. 
RICKEY Alright then, where would he rate at second? 
SMITH If he was playing now he'd be the best second baseman in the majors. 
RICKEY High praise. He'll have to be the best in the minor leagues first. 
SMITH What are you saying, Mr. Rickey? 
RICKEY I'm saying it's going to be a very interesting spring training. A lot of players are coming back from the war and with gas rationing over, we can train down in Florida again. 
SMITH Daytona Beach? 
(RICKEY NODS) You're aware in the past six months a black boy was lynched in Madison, Florida and a black man down in Live Oaks? 
RICKEY Those towns may as well be a million miles from Daytona. 
WHITE 3-14-12 14. 
SMITH Live Oaks is 150 actually. 
RICKEY I spoke to the Daytona mayor. He assures me there'll be no trouble. But Rickey doesn't sound so sure. They consider each other. 
RICKEY (CONT'D) Mr. Smith, are you a Communist? 
SMITH I'm a Democrat. Why do you ask? 
RICKEY I have a business proposition. What's your salary at the Courier? 
SMITH Fifty dollars a week. 
RICKEY I will pay you an additional fifty dollars a week plus expenses if you will attend spring training with Jackie Robinson. You will watch over him, help him to avoid the harm that could come if he were to do or say anything out of turn. You will act as his chauffeur, you will secure accommodations for him wherever the team may be, help him find restaurants, etc... 
SMITH What's in it for me? Besides the fifty dollars and a whole lot of aggravation? 
RICKEY Unprecedented access for any reportage you feel appropriate. What do you say, Mr. Smith? 
SMITH I say yes, sir. If a Negro is good enough to stop a Nazi bullet in France; he's good enough to stop a line drive at Yankee Stadium. 
RICKEY Ebbets Field actually, but yes, I agree. The world is ready.

Over 500 guests: journalists, players and politicians all listen politely as a SPEECH drones to an end. INSERT: New York City. 23rd Annual Baseball Writer's Association Dinner February 3, 1946. 
SPEAKER As our former President Herbert Hoover remarked in his tribute to our national pastime: âThe rigid voluntary rules of right and wrong, as applied in baseball, are second only to religion in strengthening the morals of the American people.' Polite applause as the speaker steps off. The clapping more enthusiastic as the lights dim on all but an impromptu set: plantation house columns. Hoots as a BUTLER appears wearing satin knee breeches and a MONTREAL ROYALS jersey. He holds a ring like a lawn jockey, a WHITE MAN in BLACK FACE. The laughs get louder as he peers out with exaggerated wide eyes. 
BUTLER Lordy, lordy, it's looking like da massa will be late dis ebning. As the LAUGHS from the audience subside, a sportswriter dressed as a COLONEL enters from stage right. 
COLONEL Robbie! Robbie!

BUTLER Ah came near bein' killed last night, Kunl. 
COLONEL How's that, Jackie boy? 
BUTLER Ah was comin' up a dark street and three men was behind me. And they tried to do me with a baseball bat.

RICKEY Listen to this, Harold. Whenever I hear a white man - yours truly - broadcasting what a Moses he is to the Negro race, then I know the latter needs a bodyguard. (Parrott tries to 
INTERJECT) It is those of the carpetbagger stripe of the white race - me again - who under the guise of helping, in truth are using the Negro for their own selfish interest, thereby retarding the race! Parrott tries to interrupt again, but Rickey is furious.

HIGBE Hell! You're supposed to go back to third when I step off! Don't you know nothing?! He throws over. Jack back to the bag. Higbe gets the ball back, looks in. Jack bouncing, pounding off third. His movements carry violence within them. Like a piston exploding in an engine. Higbe into his motion, stops his delivery, accidentally drops the ball to the ground. The umpire signals BALK, points Jack home. Higbe is furious. 
ED CHARLES - IN THE COLORED SECTION CHEERING, joyous. His mother joins in, happy despite... 
MOTHER I don't understand. What happened?

SHOTTEN Grandpa? Hey hold on, you! Security getting between as Shotten and the Manager go at it. 
BLUE REV 4-07-12 96A. Jack is embarrassed, but what can he do? Walker says to no one in particular, but loud enough for Jack to hear: 
WALKER Maybe 42's got enough friends in town, we can bunk up. 
JACK What's that supposed to mean? 
WALKER Nothing. It's just, I know when you can't get into a hotel, you got people's houses you can stay at. 
JACK What do you want from me, Walker? 
WALKER An apology. 
JACK 
(STEPS FORWARD) For what? Places like this? Parrott alarmed at this turn of events. 
WALKER For turning this season into a sideshow! I'm a ballplayer; I want to play ball! 
JACK So am I! I'm here to win! 
WALKER How the hell are we gonna win sleeping on the bus?! 
PARROTT 
FELLAS -- 
JACK It might do you some good the way you're swinging the bat lately. 
DIXIE Watch your mouth! 
PINK REV 4-19-12 97. Walker jabs his chest with a finger; Jack bats his hand away. 
JACK Watch your damn hand! And they're lunging at each other. Separated by Reese, Stanky, Branca and Bragan while other players hold off Shotton. Two fights about to break out at the same time. 
SHOTTEN Grandpa?! I'll show you grandpa! Parrott summons something deep, lets loose a shrill WHISTLE. 
PARROTT Fellas! Burt! Please! Take the bus to the field! Worry about the game. I'll find another hotel. 
164 INT. BRANCH RICKEY'S OFFICE - BROOKLYN - DAY 164 
Rickey looks up as Reese enters. He holds a LETTER. 
RICKEY What can I do for you, Pee Wee? 
REESE Well, Mr. Rickey, it's like this, the series in Cincinnati next week. 
RICKEY It's an important road trip, we're only three games out of first. 
REESE Yes, sir. You know, I'm from Kentucky. 
RICKEY Cincinnati's nearly a home game for you. 
REESE I got this letter, sir. I guess some people aren't too happy about me playing with Robinson. Rickey is not liking where this is going; he motions for the letter, scans it, reads the highlights... 
RICKEY Nigger lover. Watch yourself. We will get you, carpetbagger. (holds it out) Typical stuff. Reese takes the letter back, a little hurt. 
REESE It's not typical to me. 
RICKEY How many of these letters have you gotten, Pee Wee? 
REESE Just this. Ain't that enough? Rickey looks Reese over a moment. Pushing back his chair he steps over to a filing cabinet. 
WHITE 3-14-12 101. Motioning Reese to join him, he pulls open a drawer, pulls out a 4-inch stack of flattened letters, then another, then a third. He looks to Reese. 
REESE (CONT'D) What are those? 
RICKEY I'll tell you what they aren't, they aren't letters from the Jackie Robinson fan club. Here -- He thrusts a sheaf of it into Reese's hands. As Reese flips through the stack of hate, reads: 
REESE Get out of baseball, or your baby boy will die. 
(NEXT ONE) Quit baseball or your Nigger wife will be... Reese trails off, won't say it out loud. Skips to another. 
REESE (CONT'D) Get out of the game or be killed. He looks at one more, reacts to the vitriol, but does not utter it. Reese looks back at Rickey, shocked. 
REESE (CONT'D) Does Jackie know? 
RICKEY Of course he knows. And the FBI. They're taking a threat in Cincinnati pretty seriously. So excuse me if I'm not too shocked at you being called a carpetbagger. You should be proud of it! 
REESE We'd just like to play ball, Mr. Rickey. That's all we want to do. 
RICKEY I understand. I bet Jackie just wants to play ball. I bet he wishes he wasn't leading the league in hit by pitch. I bet he wishes people didn't want to kill him. But the world isn't so simple anymore. I'm not sure it ever was. We just, baseball ignored it. Now we can't. 
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 102. 
REESE 
(QUIET) Yes, Sir. I gotta get to practice. 
CUT TO: 
A 10-YEAR OLD BOY 165 165 In the stands. Freckled, cute. Looking at the men around him, his own FATHER SHOUTING at Jack as the Dodgers take the field (the Reds coming off it). Jack headed for first. Pee Wee out to short. 
FRECKLES Nigger! (then...) We don't want you here! INSERT: Crosley Field, Cincinnati, June 21, 1947. 
RED BARBER'S VOICE Cincinnati fans expressing their displeasure as the Dodgers take the field. Jackie Robinson at first. The Brat Eddie Stanky at second. Spider Jorgensen at third. And the captain Pee Wee Reese at shortstop.

168 EXT. INFIELD - CROSLEY FIELD - DAY 168 
Jack reaches first, throws the ball around the infield. Many in the crowd beyond rise to jeer and heap abuse. COON! SHINE! Jack tries to let it wash over him. At short, Reese receives the ball, moves to throw to first when he pauses. Deciding, he suddenly moves to trot across the diamond until he's alongside Jack. 
JACK What's up? Now cries of CARPETBAGGER! cut through. PEE WEE, HOW CAN YOU PLAY WITH THIS BLACK BASTARD!? Reese stares up at the worst hecklers along the first base line. He looks a little sad. 
REESE They can say what they want; we're here to play baseball. 
JACK Just a bunch of crackpots still fighting the Civil War. 
REESE Hell, we'd a won that son of a gun if the cornstalks had held out. We just ran out of ammunition. Jack laughs. Reese has a funny way of saying it. 
JACK Better luck next time, Pee Wee. Reese impulsively puts his arm around Jack's shoulder, stares into the Cincy dugout. 
REESE Ain't gonna be a next time. All we got is right now. This right here. Know what I mean? Walker reacting out in right. The crowd shuts down, some in shock at the gesture. Jack surprised also. 
REESE (CONT'D) Thank you, Jackie. 
JACK What're you thanking me for? 
REESE I've got family here from Louisville. Up there somewhere. I need âem to know who I am. 
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 107. 
MUSIAL (glances at blood) I don't blame you, man, you got every right. Jack running on the pitch. Reiser bunts. The play is to first. Reiser is out and Jack slides safe into second. SCHOENDIENST has the sense to vacate before he gets there. 
JACK Bouncing up and down, wearing that badge of potential violence and action. The crowd buzzing, the electricity practically hits you in the face. Jack's going to score. 
RICKEY Coming up out of his seat along with the fans around him. 
JACK Walker at bat. Jack steps out, checks on MARION the shortstop. He takes another step out, looks to Schoendienst. 
RED BARBER (over it all) Munger sets. Robbie back and forth off second. The third bag clearly in his sights. Oh, and Munger deals a pick off throw to Marion at second and Robinson is out! Marion breaks for the bag and Munger turns and fires a strike. Marion brings down the tag -- Out! He is and he knows it. The crowd stunned into silence. Jack frozen a moment, head down, furious with himself. Low. 
BARBER'S VOICE The Cardinals pick up a game. It was one of those plays where you do or you don't and Jackie didn't. 
CUT TO: 
176 INT. TRAINER'S TABLE - DODGER CLUBHOUSE - DAY 176 
Jack on his stomach as STITCHES are sewn into his leg. REPORTERS in front of him. 
REPORTER ONE Did he spike you on purpose? 
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 107A. 
JACK You saw the play. I had my foot inside the bag. He was out by a mile. But he kept coming. 
REPORTER TWO Slaughter said it was an accident. 
JACK What are you asking me for then? 
REPORTER TWO Are you calling Slaughter a liar? 
CHERRY REV 6-11-12 108. This guy's a real jerk. Rickey arrives, a BASEBALL in hand. 
RICKEY Get out. Let me talk to my first baseman. Go. He's getting stitched up for Pete's sake. The reporters move off for other interviews. Reporter Two hesitant to let it go, finally drifts off. Rickey watches. 
RICKEY Sticking up for yourself is what you'd expect of any man. Some find it galling to see it in a Negro. 
JACK I'm sorry, Mr. Rickey. 
RICKEY Sorry? Sorry for what? 
JACK I lost my cool out there. It probably cost us the game. 
RICKEY I told you, Jackie, all the best base runners get caught sometimes. 
JACK I wasn't thinking. Rickey pulls up a chair sits across from him, leans in. 
RICKEY Do you know what I saw this morning? I was passing a sandlot and a little white boy was up to bat. You know what he was doing? 
JACK Sitting on a fastball? 
RICKEY He was pretending he was you. Wiping his hands on his pants, swinging with his arms outstretched like you do. A little white boy pretending he was a black man.

178 INT. TRAINER'S TABLE - DODGER CLUBHOUSE - DAY 178 
The two men, who have done so much, looking each other over. 
JACK Why are you doing this, Mr. Rickey? 
RICKEY We had victory over fascism in Germany; it's time for victory over racism at home. 
JACK Why are you doing this? Come on now. A long moment between them. Finally, Rickey looks away. 
RICKEY I love this game. I love baseball. I've given my life to it. Forty odd years ago I was a player coach at Ohio Wesleyan University. We had a Negro catcher, best hitter on the team. Charley Thomas. Rickey starts slowly rubbing the baseball in his hands. 
RICKEY A fine young man. I saw him laid low. Broken because of the color of his skin and I didn't do enough to help. I told myself I did, but I didn't. The game I loved had something unfair at the heart of it. I ignored it. But a time came when I could no longer do that. 
(LOOKS UP) You let me love baseball again. Thank you. Jack's eyes gentle on Rickey's. 
JACK You're welcome. 
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 110. Rickey fighting back tears now, retreats to his more confident self. 
RICKEY You're a force of nature, Jackie, you've complicated everything but yourself. You're changing the world, and refusing to let it change you. I for one am in awe. Jack reaches, takes the baseball from him. A beat as they consider each other. Finally, a promise... 
JACK I won't get picked off second base again. Not this year.

193 EXT. SPORTSMAN PARK - ST. LOUIS - DAY 193 
Jack chasing down the foul, headed right for the open steps of his own dugout. He never considers the peril as he CATCHES THE BALL and his left foot comes down onto nothing -- BRANCA LEAPS forward, tackles Jack back onto the infield. 
BARBER'S VOICE He's got it! And one of the Dodgers has him!

196 INT. VISITOR'S LOCKER ROOM - SPORTSMAN PARK - DAY 196 
BARBER'S VOICE The Dodgers closing in on the Pennant as they'll leave St. Louis for Cincinnati and a three game series with the Reds. Jack sits in his grass stained pants after the game. Most of the guys are in the shower. Branca, a towel around his waist, is headed there himself. The sight of Jack stops him. 
BRANCA Can I ask you something, Jackie? How come you never shower until everyone else is done? Jack just stares at him. Branca won't let it drop. 
BRANCA You shy or something? 
JACK I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable. 
BUFF REV 5-29-12 116. 
BRANCA We're a team. On a hot streak. Half the wins on account of you. You're the bravest guy I ever saw. You're leading us and you're afraid to take a shower? A beat as Jack considers him. Stone-faced. 
BRANCA C'mon. Take a shower with me. 
(A BEAT) Hey, I don't mean it like that. 
CUT TO: 
197 SHOWERS 197 The Dodgers showering, guys chattering. Suddenly, there's Branca and Jack at the shower entrance. All eyes look over. Branca enters. Then Jack. A beat and everyone goes back to getting clean. It's no big deal. Except... Dixie Walker looks to the floor, shakes his head. Finally, quietly, he leaves. Who's the loneliest man on the team now?

199 INTERCUT WITH PARROTT 199 On a payphone in the CROSLEY FIELD CONCOURSE. 
PARROTT We did it, Boss! We did it! We swept Cincinnati! That puts us seven games up. Joyous, Rickey grabs a sheet showing the NL standings. 
RICKEY And eliminates the Giants and Boston. He puts an âX' through Boston and the Giants. The rest of the NL are already crossed out. Only the Cardinals remain. At the same time, Parrott X's the same out on his notebook. 
DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 117. 
RICKEY We'd have to lose nearly every game for the Cardinals to catch us now. One more win may do it. Who's pitching tomorrow for the Pirates? 
PARROTT Ostermueller.

199A EXT. MACDONOUGH STREET - BROOKLYN - DAY 199A 
Rachel walks pushing Jackie Junior in his stroller. As she moves, the RADIO BROADCAST of the Dodgers' game can be heard from one house to the next. In a gap, a passing car picks it up and we hear it from the window. Then another house. 
BARBER'S VOICE A very big game today here in Pittsburgh. A win and the Dodgers will have clinched the National League Pennant. 
CUT TO: 
199B EXT. EBBETS FIELD - DAY 199B 
Branch Rickey alone in the stadium. The field empty as he listens to the call of the game over the PA.

BARBER'S VOICE Ostermueller winds and throws, low and away ball two. Fritz seems to be pitching around Jackie. Or trying to get him to chase.

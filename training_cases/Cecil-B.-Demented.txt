Cut to thriving "Harbor Court" theaters, downtown chain. All six marquees list the same two mega-budget Hollywood hits. Hollywood titles fade out and "Cecil B. DeMented" title logo fades into marquee in all its terrorist glory. 
Cut to old "Towson Theater." A "FOR RENT" sign is on marquee of this one-time neighborhood theater. "FOR RENT" sign fades out and our credits fade in on marquee. 
Cut to "Towson Commons," a modern cineplex down the street. All the titles listed on marquee are sequels. Sequel titles fade out and our credits fade in on marquee.

HONEY WHITLOCK 
IN 
"SOME KIND OF HAPPINESS" Marquee letters fade out and our credits fade in. Cut to blocks of cement out front of the theater similar to Grauman's Chinese Theater in Los Angeles. Each displays the logo of a film title that was shot on location in Baltimore and premiered at this theater; "Diner," "The Accidental Tourist," "And Justice For 
All." Our credits are intercut in the cement blocks as the camera pans across this local tourist attraction. Cut to SINCLAIR STEVENS, the handsome but intense 20-year-old theater manager as he adjusts the final letter of the film's title on the marquee, perched atop a ladder. SINCLAIR is dressed in an obviously rented tuxedo and for a moment seems like any other middle class suburban kid. 
ROY STILLINGS, the tuxedoed fifty-year-old theater owner, shouts instructions from below as CATERERS, DECORATORS and PUBLICITY PEOPLE rush in an out of theater preparing for tonight's event. He is surrounded by several of his young staff - DINAH, the sourpussed but unconventionally striking cashier; CHARDONNAY, the African-American ticket-taker with a huge 90's hairdo so popular with the black girls in Baltimore; RAVEN, the happy and always smiling pretty usherette, and FIDGET, the dweebish but somehow sexy janitor. All have made an attempt to dress up their usual uniforms for the premiere. 
MR. STILLINGS A little more to the right, Sinclair. 
SINCLAIR (Moving the final "S" 
IN "HAPPINESS") That better, Mr. Stillings? Title on marquee fades out and "Produced by..." credit fades in. 
MR. STILLINGS 
(SQUINTING) Yeah, that's good. 
(STILL UNSATISFIED) But try moving the "K" in "Whitlock." A little to the left. 
SINCLAIR (Following his boss's instructions, the "Some Kind Of Happiness" title back on the marquee) Have you met her yet? 
MR. STILLINGS Not yet. But don't worry, Sinclair, I'll introduce you! 
SINCLAIR You promise? 
SINCLAIR smiles sneakily to himself as "Some Kind Of Happiness" logo fades out on marquee and "Written and Directed by John Waters" credit fades in. 
SINCLAIR 
(EVILLY) I'm a bg fan! 
End of credits. 
(APPALLED) You asked the hotel manager if Pat Nixon had sex in my room? 
LIBBY Well. . .sort of. I mean you told me... 
HONEY I was kidding Libby. He must think you're a complete lunatic! Good God, you'd do anything! A HOTEL MAID pushing a cart of towels and bathroom supplies comes around a corner and is completely star-struck. 
MAID Good luck, Miss Whitlock! HONEY's face freezes in horror as elevator doors open and she is led inside. 
9. INTERIOR ELEVATOR. 9. Several well-dressed hotel guests recognize HONEY and are thrilled. 
HONEY (In a sudden tirade) Did you hear what that little bitch said to me? 
LIBBY She didn't know. 
HONEY In show business we say "break a leg." NEVER fucking "Good Luck"! 
HOTEL GUESTS frown in disappointment at HONEY's language. 
LIBBY 
(TO HONEY) That's just an old superstition. 
CHARLES 
(NERVOUSLY) Miss Whitlock, there's photo cps with the mayor in the lobby... 
HONEY That cocksucker put a curse on my whole fucking premiere! HOTEL GUESTS let out a cry of shock at HONEY's language. 
10. INTERIOR HOTEL LOBBY. 10. MAYOR FENWICK, the middle aged African American mayor waits with the PRESS. HONEY steps off the elevator completely composed to a burst of flashbulbs. 
HONEY Mayor Fenwick! LIBBY and CHARLES look to one another relieved as HOTEL GUESTS stumble out of elevator, shaking their heads in disgust. 
MAYOR Miss Whitlock, what an honor! They pose together as PRESS snaps away. 
HONEY I love what you've done with this city. 
MAYOR And Baltimore loves you back! (Takes out proclamation) I, Adam Fenwick, Mayor of the City of Baltimore, do hereby proclaim April 29th to be Honey Whitlock Day in Maryland and do command this observation to all of our citizens. Whereas...

MR. STILLINGS Christ, there's what's-her-name from E Network. Look at the tits on her! LYLE hits MR. STILLINGS over the head with the film can.

22. INTERIOR WHITE LIMO. 22. CHARLES the press agent, LIBBY the assistant, and RODNEY the bodyguard sit in back with HONEY as she gives a phone interview. PETIE the chauffeur winks sexily in rear view mirror to RODNEY the bodyguard, who smiles back uneasily, 
HONEY (On phone, being a star) "Some Kind Of Happiness" is a 
(MORE) 
screwball romantic comedy - life-affirming but realistic and to be honest, with all the misery in the world today, couldn't we use a little optimism in the movies? 
23. EXTERIOR SENATOR THEATER. 23. SINCLAIR smiles evilly, holding a huge bouquet of flowers as LEWIS greets MAYOR and BODYGUARDS as they exit limo to applause from CROWD. HONEY's white limo pulls up behind them, led by MOTORCYCLE ESCORT. 
SINCLAIR (Into his walkie-talkie) 7:06pm...The Big Snatch. HONEY steps from limo and waves like a true star to roar of approval from crowd as PRESS blinds her with flashbulbs.

24. INTERIOR SENATOR THEATER. STAGE. 24. MRS.

MRS. MALLORY Little William had heart surgery just seven days ago and thanks to the blood transfusion paid for by your generosity at tonight's premiere, he's going to be alright, aren't you, Little William? 
LITTLE WILLIAM 
(SULLENLY) I don't want to be here! 
MRS. MALLORY (To AUDIENCE as she tries to hug him) Little William's a little grumpy... 
LITTLE WILLIAM (Snatching away her hands, under his breath) Get off me, ugly.

(TO AUDIENCE) .But he's ALIVE, and that's what counts! AUDIENCE applauds.

it. DINAH comes running, firing into the air, and throws bags of money into back of limo and jumps in. CHERISH, LYLE, RAVEN, FIDGET, CHARDONNAY and PAM come charging out of theater, firing their guns to cover their escape. CECIL drags HONEY outside, still in a chokehold as RODNEY fires wildly to keep anyone at bay. 
HONEY (To HORRIFIED FANS who duck for cover) 
HELP ME! CALL THE STUDIO! 
CALL JACK VALENTI! HELLLPPP! PETIE opens the trunk of the limo and RODNEY and CECIL throw HONEY inside and slam it shut. HONEY continues screaming and banging on trunk door as CECIL and GANG pile into limo. 
CECIL 
(TO GANG) 
POWER TO THE PEOPLE WHO 
PUNISH BAD CINEMA! PETIE peels out in limo as PREMIERE GUESTS and FANS dive out of the way and GANG chants "Battle of Algiers"-type revolutionary yell. CECIL fires his gun out back window and shatters the "Some Kind Of Happiness" logo on marquee. 
45. INTERIOR SPEEDING LIMO. 45. CHERISH lunges for CECIL and they french kiss hotly. From PETIE's POV behind the wheel we see COP CAR #1 with sirens wailing and lights flashing heading towards premiere.

CECIL I fuckin' hate car chase scenes! 
PETIE (Flooring the accelerator, 
PISSED) Yeah, but "Bullit" was good! LYLE snorts cocaine off a coke-spoon and nonchalantly picks glass out of his hair. 
LYLE But it lead to the "French Connection." 
CHARDONNAY 
(VICIOUSLY) Which inspired a sequel! 
LEWIS And lead to "Smokey and The Bandit" and that kinda shit! PETIE sees another cop car speeding up behind him in the rear view mirror. DINAH leans out limo window and fires gun back'at cop car. 
PAM 
(FURIOUS) "Smokey and The Bandit" even had fuckin' sequels... Another cop car speeds towards them from the front trying to cut them off. 
PETIE (Insane, driving like a lunatic) Yeah, Part fucking Two, 1980!... 
DINAH 
(IN DISGUST) Part Three, 1983! 
CECIL 
(PSYCHOTICALLY) "Smokey and The Bandit" ruined my childhood! CECIL fires his gun in the nick of time and shatters approaching cop car's windshield. 
PETIE makes a hard right and zooms up church driveway as two cop cars collide behind him. FIDGET cheers like a kid and starts absentmindedly playing pocket pool. 
48. EXTERIOR CHURCH ROAD. 48. Another cop car is speeding to premiere from behind the church and almost hits the limo as PETIE veers right in the "V" in the road, narrowly missing a MINISTER and a suspiciously SENSITIVE TEEN as they leave the church rectory. 
LEWIS We met. I'm Lewis, the art director. I hope you'll be comfortable here... HONEY looks around cell and sees giant stills blown up from her past films showing her in physical and emotional distress. 
LEWIS 
(MOVING CLOSER) .'cause you ain't goin' nowhere else! HE staples her gown to the chair. FIDGET, the grunge dweeb, dressed in complete rags but looking somehow great with his "William Castle" tattoo, shyly steps forward, absentmindedly playing "pocket pool." 
FIDGET 
(BASHFUL) I'm Fidget, the costumer... (Suddenly rips dress to give her a plunging neckline) Sorry.. .but I'm gonna have to give you a new look... RAVEN, smiling beatifically, steps forward dressed in a satanic robe, an inverted cross necklace, pentagram jewelry and a "Kenneth Anger" tattoo. 
RAVEN Hi, I'm Raven and I'm a Satanist. I'll be doing your makeup... HONEY stares back in confusion. 
RAVEN You look so pale... RAVEN suddenly slaps HONEY across face and HONEY cries out in shock. 
RAVEN Sorry... but Satan says... you need color! RODNEY, the biker "bodyguard," now in S&M leather get-up steps toward HONEY carrying a rat-tail comb and a hair dye applicator bottle. His "Almodovar" tattoo is a beauty. 
RODNEY Call me Rodney. Tomorrow I'm bleaching your hair out platinum and I should warn you...I FUCKING HATE ROOTS! PETIE, the sexy hillbilly "chauffeur," now dressed in redneck militant garb and featuring a "Fassbinder" tattoo, steps forward. 
PETIE Hey, I'm Petie, remember me, "the trailer trash"? I'll be your driver. I'll take you anywhere... anywhere but home!! (Laughs evilly as he 
CARESSES RODNEY) From behind a curtain, covering a room of lab and editing equipment comes DINAH, now dressed in alarming vintage fashion outfit that shows off her shapely but purposely hairy legs. "Sam Fuller" is tattooed on her back. She wheels a TV set and VCR mounted on wheels framed by little velvet curtain. 
DINAH (Snarling to HONEY) I'm Dinah, Cecil's prodÂ»cer and I do everything! I've been knocking down box office money from every big Hollywood hit for years to pay for this 
(MORE) 
equipment. You fuck with me, sister, and you're DEAD! (Smugly to CECIL) We made the news... CECIL nods to DINAH to turn on the VCR to show clip taped from TV. 
NEWSMAN . So once again, our top story. Sylvia Mallory, the fifty-two year old chairwoman of the Maryland Heart Fund died tonight at Union Memorial Hospital following an on stage heart attack she suffered in the middle of Honey Whitlock's kidnapping at tonight's Baltimore movie premiere... SPROCKET HOLES stare in amazement at TV screen, the enormity of their act barely sinking in. 
NEWSMAN .the teenage gang of cinema terrorists who apparently infiltrated the staff of the Senator Theater are now eligible for the death penalty in the State of Maryland... CECIL nods to DINAH to turn it off, which she does. SPROCKET HOLES gulp and look to their leader for guidance. CECIL steps forward, getting right in HONEY's terrified face. 
CECIL Miss Whitlock, we're going to make our first film and NOBODY'S going to stop us. Lots of kids dream of making a movie... SPROCKET HOLES smile in brain-washed enthusiasm. 
CECIL .but only the ones willing to dia for it succeed. HONEY looks into CECIL's face and lets out a sob of terror. 
FADE OUT. 55. Fade in to EXTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE." Next morning. 55. We hear HONEY letting out a fresh cry of agony. 
56. INTERIOR "SPROCKET HOUSE" - "HAIR AND MAKEUP," 56. a dilapidated section of the loft filled with broken mirrors, beat up barber chairs, filthy hair driers and mangy beauty supplies. HONEY, tied to a barber chair, still dressed in her raggedy premiere gown, moans in pain as RODNEY, in scary rubber fetish outfit, sadistically applies the final batch of double strength bleach to HONEY's already shockingly blond hair. RAVEN, wearing another "witchy" black robe and 666 earrings, finishes up HONEY's overly-theatrical makeup job. 
HONEY 
(TO RODNEY) Owwww! Please! I don't want to be blond! 
RODNEY You're going right off the deep end of the Clairol color chart! RODNEY squirts on more dye. 
HONEY It's burning my scalp! Ow! Ow! Ow! 
RODNEY Beauty comes from agony! Everyone knows that! 
RAVEN I haven't had this much fun since my last livestock mutilation... RAVEN lunges towards HONEY's eyebrows and painfully tweezes out a hair. 
HONEY Oh God! That really hurt! 
RAVEN "In the House of Pain, there 
(MORE) 
are 10,000 shrines." 
(GIGGLING) Allistair Crowley said that. 
CECIL (To HONEY, ever the 
LEADER) Don't worry, they're not allowed any form of sexual release.:. HONEY nervously starts to unzip her gown. SPROCKET HOLES let out an involuntary sexual moan. 
HONEY (Muttering, furious) The Screen Actors Guild will hear about this and I mean it! HONEY lets gown fall to floor and steps out of it. She is wearing beautiful lingerie. 
FIDGET 
DAMN! 
RAVEN 
NICE VESSEL! 
FIDGET (Starts reaching into his pocket, subtly) Excuse me, ma'am. (Starts playing pocket pool) 
RODNEY moans in sexual frustration as HONEY begins getting dressed in FIDGET's costume. DINAH pants from above as HONEY slips on tight pants. LEWIS, CHARDONNAY, and PAM watch from peepholes, breathing hard and moaning as HONEY slips into jacket. PETIE appears and jealously catches RODNEY trying to peek down the front of HONEY's jacket. RODNEY looks away guiltily. FIDGET whacks and "creates," lewdly "styling" HONEY's outfit. He then wheels full-length mirror to HONEY and signals to CECIL she is ready. HONEY sees her transformation into terrorist glamour girl for the first time. 
HONEY Oh, God, I look terrible! (Breaks into sobs) CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES applaud triumphantly. 
DINAH (Suddenly all business) Alright, LET'S LOCK IT UP! 
62 INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. SOUND STAGE. 62 CECIL leads HONEY to set, past equipment and lights as SPROCKET HOLES scurry to position, adjusting lights, setting up camera, readying props. 
CECIL 
(TO HONEY) This is Sprocket House, Miss Whitlock, think of it as your studio. They arrive at the amazingly inventive exterior set of "RITZ CINEMA," a tiny guilded movie palace gone to seed. Marquee reads: PASOLINI FESTIVAL. HONEY stares dumbfounded. 
CECIL Can't you say good morning to Lewis? He worked hard on this set with a budget of zero. 
HONEY Good... morning. 
LEWIS 
(PROUDLY) All these materials were stolen from city-owned construction sites...just for you! We're gonna have a hit, Miss Whitlock! 
CECIL Our picture is called "Raving Beauty." You play the insane owner of a failed art theater who along with her film fanatic boyfriend Lyle. . .Lyle come on over... LYLE enters dressed in hepcat 70's junkie splendor wear. 
CECIL .and her violence prone daughter, Cherish... CHERISH enters in eye-popping "super model goes bad" look as HONEY's eyes light up in horror. 
HONEY "Daughter"?! 
CECIL .Together, the three of you vow to start a revolution to destroy mainstream cinema... 
HONEY 
(BRAVELY) I cannot make this movie! DINAH quickly hands CECIL a stun-gun. 
CECIL You dare to tell Cecil B. DeMented you refuse! 
HONEY I'm too young to play her mother! 
CECIL 
(THREATENINGLY) I know how cid you are... 
HONEY (Trying to change the subject) It doesn't feel right... I'm just not motivated... 
CECIL (Advancing on her with 
STUN GUN) How's this for motivation? Huh? CECIL zaps her painfully with the stun gun. HONEY twitches in agony and lets out a painful scream. 
CHARDONNAY (Spinning sound boom 
INTO POSITION) Speed. 
PAM Mark it! DINAH marks the take. 
CECIL 
ACTION! 
LYLE (Entering in character) Hey, Cherish, it's 8:00. Am I supposed to get this show on the screen or what? 
CHERISH 
(IN CHARACTER) I didn't sell one ticket, Lyle. Nobody came! 
LYLE Pasolini's playing and we have an empty theater? HONEY enters and does the lines convincingly. 
HONEY 
(IN CHARACTER) It's that fucking new multiplex that opened in the mall, isn't it? CECIL's eyes light up in happiness at HONEY's performance. 
CHERISH I heard they were sold out last night, Mom. 
LYLE Not for "THE FLINTSTONES"?! 
HONEY (Getting even better) Somebody's gotta pay for this insult! CECIL silently mouths the dialogue along with HONEY. 
HONEY From the empty movie seats of every good movie theater in America, we will rise to take back the screen! 
The SPROCKET HOLES watch in awe. 
HONEY Death to those who support mainstream cinema! 
CECIL 
(TRIUMPHANTLY) CUT and PRINT! CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES burst into applause. 
CECIL That's more like it, Miss Whitlock! CHERISH gives HONEY a suddenly jealous look. 
HONEY (Feeling her oats) To be frank, Cecil, I would never do this picture in my real film life. The whole message is stupid - ask theater owners in any country and they'll tell you. Hollywood makes the best films in the world and I'm proud to be part of that system. 
CECIL (Suddenly the dictator again) Let's move on! 
HONEY 
(SHOCKED) What? No coverage? 
CECIL The first take is the only real truth... 
HONEY But you can't cut the film with only a master! 
CECIL There are no rules in outlaw cinema, Miss Whitlock, only edges. We believe technique to be nothing more than failed style. You see, I've had a vision... All the SPROCKET HOLES smile like film zombies to 
HONEY. 
CECIL .and that vision is called "ultimate reality." The rest of our film is shot in real life, with real people ... . and yes, with real terror. 63. Flip wipe to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. Industrial 63. doors swing open and freshly painted phony FEDEX truck comes speeding out. 
HONEY (VOICE OVER) Please, no! Let's go back! I hate location work! 64. INTERIOR FEDEX VAN as it drives through downtown 64. streets and enters Jones Falls Expressway. PETIE is behind the wheel as LYLE and CHERISH study their lines in hand-written "Raving Beauty" script. CECIL hurriedly flips through TIME Magazine until he finds the article he wants. RODNEY and RAVEN torture HONEY with their constant touchups as PAM, CHARDONNAY, DINAH and FIDGET crowd in the back of van with equipment and guns as LEWIS reads a copy of "Psychotronic" magazine. 
RODNEY I see a fucking root already! He lunges to HONEY's scalp with hair dye applicator bottle. 
68. INTERIOR VAN. 68. HONEY, LYLE and CHERISH prepare to leap out of van. 
CECIL 
(SMILING INSANELY) 
ACTION! 
69. EXTERIOR TIMONIUM CINEMA. 69. LYLE and CHERISH leap from van with guns drawn. 
LYLE and CHERISH (Chanting in character) 
SABOTAGE THE CINEMA! TAKE BACK 
THE SCREEN! HONEY leaps out with gun drawn. 
HONEY (In character, chanting) 
VANDALIZE THE MOVIES! GIVE 
BACK THE DREAM! (Suddenly out of character) This is sQ stupid... CECIL leaps from van followed by SPROCKET HOLES carrying props. 
CECIL (Aiming his gun at HONEY, 
FURIOUS) Say the lines the way they're written! HONEY, terrified, immediately jumps back into character. 
HONEY (Yelling to BOX OFFICE LADY in ticket booth) How dare you play this rotten movie?! PAM pans the camera to BOX OFFICE LADY whose eyes light up in fear at seeing the "actors" in their terrorist outfits. 
BOX OFFICE LADY Oh my God, it's Honey Whitlock! 
CECIL (Yelling to "actors" into 
MEGAPHONE) 
I SAID ACTION! LYLE and CHERISH grab HONEY and they run toward BOX 
OFFICE LADY. 
HONEY (To BOX OFFICE LADY) $7.50 for this piece of shit?! BOX OFFICE LADY screams and locks herself inside as HONEY spray-paints S-H-I-T across box office glass. 
Macho TICKET TAKER kid comes running out. 
TICKET TAKER 
(TO HONEY) Hey you! You got a problem? 
LYLE (For the camera) 
FEEL THE PAIN OF UNDERGROUND 
FILM! 
(PUNCHES HIM) 
CHERISH 
THE KICK OF OUTLAW CINEMA! (Kicks TICKET TAKER in balls) 
LYLE (To HONEY, breaking out 
OF CHARACTER) WOW! I'm peaking! RODNEY, RAVEN and FIDGET run to HONEY and touch her up and adjust costume whenever she's off camera. 
ALL 
CELIBATE FOR CELLULOID! 
CECIL 
SAY IT AGAIN LOUDER! HONEY absentmindedly joins in as she stares at herself in rushes looking quite stellar as,CHERISH eyes her jealously. 
ALL 
CELIBATE FOR CELLULOID. 
CECIL 
LIGHTS OUT! 
Immediate black-out. 74. Slow Fade-in to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE.SUNRISE. 74. 75. Cut to INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 75. SPROCKET HOLES are passed out all over loft, surrounded by rotting junk food, empty liquor bottles and last night's party debris. CECIL and CHERISH lie asleep twisted and entwined in the sheets, tortured by their erotic dreams. Suddenly, one of CECIL's bloodshot eyes open and he lurches for the microphone. 
CECIL (In a booming voice to all the SPROCKET HOLES 
BELOW HIM) Hey kids! Wake up! Let's make a mother-fucking movie! He hits hideously loud alarm button. SPROCKET HOLES leap to their feet and stagger into film production. 
76. INTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. HONEY'S DRESSING ROOM. 76. Before she can barely open her eyes, HONEY sees RODNEY and RAVEN rushing towards her, their instruments of beauty torture ready. 
RODNEY (Glaring at HONEY's hair) I see that fucking brown color... 
HONEY Please Rodney, those aren't roots - they're scabs on my scalp from the dye and they're raw! RODNEY sadistically squirts her roots with dye as HONEY lets out a cry of agony. 
RAVEN 
(SMILING) Just close your eyes and think of the films of George Cukor. RAVEN tweezes HONEY'S eyebrows painfully as RODNEY continues to torture her hair. 
HONEY OWWWW!! Please... please... (Trying a new tactic) Raven, you're a pretty girl, you could escape this madness... 
RAVEN Escape to what, Honey? 
(PROUDLY) My father is a Zo-Zo, the three-headed guard dog at the gate of hell! 
HONEY Well ...I'm sorry to hear that... 
RAVEN And one day I'm gonna commit revolutionary suicide for celluloid... 
HONEY 
(REALLY SCARED) Don't say that, Raven! Tell her, Rodney - no movie is worth dying for! RODNEY blasts HONEY's hair with his fiery malfunctioning drier as she cries out in pain. 
HONEY OWWWW! Rodney, why do you want to hurt me? Gay men are supposed to be gentle... 
RODNEY (Begins teasing HONEY's hair) That's just it, Honey! I'm not gay. I'm straight and I fucking hate it! Petie loves me but I can't love him back! I've tried! I kiss him and all I feel is beard. 
I CAN'T TAKE THAT CERTAIN THICKNESS 
IN HIS PANTS! 
(SOBBING) I'm so ashamed of my heterosexuality! 
RAVEN 
(COMFORTING HIM) Oh, it's alright, Rodney. 
RODNEY (Suddenly snapping back 
I. .HAVE...A...VISION... SPROCKET HOLES gather around him in militant enthusiasm. 
CECIL .And this time somebody might have to die! 79. Wipe to EXTERIOR SPROCKET HOUSE. 79. Doors swing open and CECIL's speeding van, driven by PETIE and now hurriedly painted over to resemble UTZ Potato Chips delivery vehicle, flies out and careens around the corner. 
80. INTERIOR VAN. 80. 
CECIL is hastily re-writing his script in long-hand and as soon as he finishes a page, DINAH snatches it and passes it out to HONEY, LYLE and CHERISH who are now dressed in FIDGET'S newest terrorist costumes. The rest of the SPROCKET HOLES, dressed in caterer's outfits, huddle in the back of the van preparing the film equipment. RODNEY and RAVEN, as always, touch up HONEY. 
CECIL (Finishing up last page of script, to HONEY, LYLE 
AND CHERISH) OK, in this scene you guys are the avenging angels of underground cinema... 
LYLE We'll let these fat cat producers know! 
CHERISH Yeah, that Maryland is not safe for their kind of movies! 
HONEY Cherish, this is America. They have the freedom to make bad films if they so desire... 
CECIL Not anymore they don't! 
CHERISH (Suddenly testy, to HONEY) You think just 'cause you made "real" movies that you're better than me, don't you? 
HONEY Oh, please... 
CHERISH Do you know w I became a porno star?! SPROCKET HOLES groan, they've heard it before. 
CECIL 
(TO HONEY) Cherish has recovered memory. 
CHERISH 
(TO HONEY) When I was ten years old my entire family fucked me under the Christmas tree... 
HONEY 
(STAMMERING) I'm.. . so sorry. 
CHERISH I guess you are. "Jingle Balls, Jingle Balls," my stupid brother started singing. You think that's funny? 
HONEY No...not at all.

CHERISH 
(IN CHARACTER) 
WE WANT FRONTAL NUDITY!! FAMILIES howl in anger, covering their children's ears and continue forward in an angry mob. 
CECIL (Beginning to retreat, 
TO HONEY) Keep the scene going! 
FAMILY LADY A 
YOU STINK HONEY WHITLOCK! 
HONEY (Nervously to CECIL) But Cecil...you didn't write me any dialogue... 
CECIL You're one of us now, you know what to say! 
FAMILY MAN B I walk out of your films on airplanes! HONEY gets hit in the head with a Jujy Fruit. 
HONEY 
OWWWW! (Suddenly snapping into 
CHARACTER) 
FAMILY IS JUST A DIRTY 
WORD FOR CENSORSHIP! FAMILIES' eyes light up in rage as they charge CECIL, HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES, pelting them with their concession candies. Completely outnumbered, and out of ammunition, CECIL realizes they had better run for their lives. 
CECIL 
CUT! MOVING ON! CECIL and SPROCKET HOLES take off with FAMILIES in hot pursuit. 98. EXTERIOR "PATTERSON THEATER." Around the corner 98. from the "Grand Theater." Marquee announces "ADMISSION ONE DOLLAR ALL TIMES" and lists three recent Jackie Chan film titles. CECIL and his SPROCKET HOLES round the corner and stop in happiness at seeing the theater.

CECIL 
ACTION FANS! HELP US! 
The entire audience of tough ACTION FANS leap to their feet. FAMILIES rush into theater and freeze in horror at the sight of ACTION FANS. As karate mayhem rages on screen, ACTION FANS attack FAMILIES with karate chops and FAMILIES turn in their tracks and run for their lives. HONEY is mobbed by ACTION FANS who beg for autographs. HONEY signs, confused but willing.

DRIVER FUCK HIM! He'll never get distribution! 
(TO CECIL) 
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN SHOW 
BUSINESS ANYMORE! SPROCKET HOLES freeze in horror at FIDGET'S disloyalty and stare at him in cult pressure. HONEY pops an olive into martini glass and looks up in surprise. 
CECIL 
(TO FIDGET) I knew you were the weak one, Fidget. (Eyes widening in hypnotic 
FRENZY) But just remember - your parents liked "Godzilla"! 
LYLE They wouldn't let you see R-rated films as a child! 
DINAH They've never been to a midnight movie! FIDGET starts to crack as his hand creeps in his pocket. 
CHARDONNAY They enjoy classic TV sitcoms turned into feature length films! 
CHERISH They've never rented a porno movie! FIDGET starts whacking nervously. 
CECIL (Right in FIDGET's face) And to top it off...they talk out loud in the theater once the feature has begun! SPROCKET HOLES grimace in horror. Even HONEY shakes her head in disgust as she pours martini into glass. 
HONEY That really is unforgivable, Fidget! 
FIDGET looks around at the brainwashed faces of his disgusted, judgmental cult and crumbles. HONEY greedily gulps down her martini. 
FIDGET 
OK! OK! MY PARENTS ARE THE 
ENEMY OF FILM! DO IT! PETIE brands FIDGET as CECIL smiles victoriously. HONEY, slightly tipsy, joins the SPROCKET HOLES in singing the refrain. 
ALL 
DEMENTED FOREVER! CECIL turns to HONEY as PETIE brandishes the red hot iron. 
CECIL And you...Honey? 
HONEY No, Cecil... CECIL nods to DINAH who plays the tape. HONEY sees her ex-husband, a handsome movie star on screen with JAY LENO on "The Tonight Show." 
EX-HUSBAND Well, I was married to her for seven years so I know just how nuts Honey Whitlock is... JAY LENO and STUDIO AUDIENCE howls in laughter. HONEY stares at TV, betrayed as RAVEN gently puts her t arms around her in comfort. 
RAVEN Satan loves you, Honey, and so do I. Tape cuts to LIBBY, HONEY's assistant, talking to ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT. Subtitle on TV read "Honey Whitlock's Personal Assistant." 
LIBBY .Honey Whitlock was always attracted to the wrong kind of man. It wouldn't surprise 
(MORE) 
me if she was in on her kidnapping from the very beginning. She'd do anything for sex... HONEY howls in indignation as LYLE gives her a funny look. FIDGET pours her another quick martini. 
CECIL 
(TO HONEY) You ain't seen nothing yet! Tape cuts to FILM COMMISSIONER, bandaged but defiant. 
FILM COMMISSIONER (Looking into camera) Cecil B. DeMented, you can never stop Hollywood! The Maryland Film Commission is pleased to announce there will be nna delay in tomorrow's once-secret start date for the 65 million dollar, 
SHOT-ENTIRELY-IN-BALTIMORE SEQUEL to the Oscar-winning masterpiece, "Forrest Gump"... SPROCKET HOLES let out a cry of horror.

CAN I HAVE FUCKING QUIET?! 
SOUND MAN Speed! CHARDONNAY pulls gun on stupefied SOUND MAN as he listens through earphones on the side of the set. PETIE pistol whips the CRANE OPERATOR. CECIL, finally atop a real professional film crane, licks it in sudden sexual passion. 
PAM (Disgustedly, looking through Panavision camera, disguising her voice like a man) Mark it! CAMERA ASSISTANT marks the take. 
DIRECTOR 
ACTION! MICHAEL J. FOX munches a crab cake on park bench as scene begins. A LARGE LADY sits next to him on bench. 
MICHAEL J. FOX Hi, I'm Forrest Gump... 
LARGE LADY That's a damn shame... 
MICHAEL J. FOX You want some of my crab cake?... CECIL jams his fingers in his ears and twists his face in agony at hearing the dialogue as PAM nervously operates a Panavision camera for the first time. CECIL catches her secret enjoyment of the high-tech equipment and gives her a furious look. PETIE expertly lowers them down on crane, mimicking the original opening shot of "Forrest Gump." 
DIRECTOR happily watches the shot in his video monitor without looking up. 
LARGE LADY (To MICHAEL J. FOX) I don't eat scavengers. You know what crabs eat? Fish feces. 
MICHAEL J. FOX 
(IN CHARACTER) Well, my Mama always said "Gump happens." Shucks, I guess life is like a crab cake, there's good stuff inside but it's surrounded by a lot of crap. 
CECIL 
CUT! 
DIRECTOR (Looking up in shock) What the hell? 
CECIL I I am Cecil B. DeMented and this picture is TERMINATED. PAM shoves Panavision camera off crane and it just E misses DIRECTOR as it smashes to floor. 
DIRECTOR (Horrified but being 
A HERO) Get off my set! NOW! LEWIS pushes over a giant light that just misses a terrified MICHAEL J. FOX and LARGE LADY as it crashes to set. 
DIRECTOR

We see CHERISH in the film dressed in skimpy lingerie outfit and Honey Whitlock wig as she writes in her diary on bed. 
CHERISH (VOICE OVER as camera pans her body) Dear Diary, another day and the same old thing... everywhere I go-everything I do seems to lead to the same dead end...

"SNIFFLES," the mutant theater employee behind counter reads "Hershey Highway," a porno mag with CHERISH's picture on cover. CHERISH, disheveled, filthy and out of her mind with fear, comes running and, force of habit, adjusts her breasts to look good. 
CHERISH Hey buddy, I'm in a little bit of trouble... 
SNIFFLES Oh my God, it's you! 
(MORE) 
(GUSHING) I was just looking at your ass right in this magazine. 
CHERISH Yeah, that's my ass alright and it's in trouble. Can me and my friends come inside? 
SNIFFLES You sure can! We sell your tits. (Grabs a pair out of box) CHERISH signals and CECIL, HONEY and SPROCKET HOLES come inside. 
SNIFFLES 
(TO CECIL) Hi! I can't believe it's her! I beat off to her every night! (Hands CHERISH her fake breasts) Would you sign 'em? "To Sniffles." 
CHERISH

WHOOPS! AUDIENCE lets out a moan of ecstasy. Cut to CECIL, CHERISH and SPROCKET HOLES, injured but suddenly horny as they take their seats in middle of the theater. 
CHERISH (On screen, squirming around bed, trying to find her 
PET GERBIL) Where are you little Pellett? Heeerrreee little gerbil! On screen we see a closeup of PELLETT's excited face and then the movie cuts to PELLETT's point of view, CHERISH's great ass. CECIL watches in sudden horniness but catches himself. CHERISH looks over at HONEY, proud of her on-screen work. HONEY smiles politely and then catches eye of ruggedly handsome 35-year-old GROUPIE in audience wearing a Honey Whitelock T-shirt. 
GROUPIE (Mouthing to HONEY) I'll be your cinema slave. HONEY blushes but smiles back at him. 
CHERISH 
(ON SCREEN) Heeerrreee Pellett! Mommy's got some Cheerios for you! The movie on screen cuts to CHERISH in a closeup. She lets out an erotic squeal.

GROUPIE Bomb "Planet Hollywood." 
HONEY Get ahold of yourself... Their car pulls up to TICKET SELLER. 
GROUPIE (To TICKET SELLER, trying to act normal) Two adults. 
TICKET SELLER Ten dollars. 
(TO HONEY) Hey, that's pretty good... 
HONEY (Suddenly the consummate 
ACTRESS) Thanks. What's the prize if I win? 
TICKET SELLER A big ham! What else?! 
(LAUGHS HIDEOUSLY) HONEY clenches her teeth in mortification as GROUPIE pulls off into drive-in, fuming. CECIL, CHERISH and RAVEN's heads pop up from hiding in back seat under blanket. 
CECIL This is it - our final location. 
CHERISH (Excited, to HONEY) We're gonna get laid! 
CECIL Nobody leaves this drive-in alive until we finish our film. 
GROUPIE

GIRL FAN Or those last minute fuck-head ticket buyers who enter the theater after the feature has begun! GIRL FAN sees CECIL, badly injured, as he limps past car with CHERISH to concession stand. 
GIRL FAN 
(IN AWE) Oh my God... the greatest director of all time! 137. Cut to ROW OF DRIVE-IN. 137. HONEY stands transfixed in between cars as she watches her old self on screen with disdain as GROUPIE gently tries to pull her away. 
GROUPIE Come on, you didn't know... On drive-in screen, HONEY's character clutches the cat, races down steps to first floor of her house and sees HIT MAN #2 briefly staring through front door. Her CHARACTER runs to kitchen in fear and drops cat to get butcher knife out of kitchen drawer. RAVEN and FIDGET, both injured, touch up and adjust HONEY's final insane terrorist-chic look. 
RAVEN 
(TO HONEY) You have cinematic immunity now. 
FIDGET None of your old movies count. CAT, on screen, scurries through "cat-door" cut in kitchen wall and escapes outside. In car next to HONEY, REDNECK MOM, POP and DORKY KID watch the movie. MOM is weary "Honey Whitlock" wig. 
REDNECK MOM I bet she's Miss Phony Baloney in real life. 
REDNECK DAD She don't look so hot to me. I prefer Meg Ryan or somebody younger. 
DORKY KID (Slurping his soft drink) Can I get more food? 
(SLURPS AGAIN)

HELICOPTER COP 
(ON SPEAKER) 
WE'RE NOT STUDIO EXECUTIVES! WE'RE 
THE BALTIMORE CITY POLICE 
DEPARTMENT! JOCKS and CECIL ENEMIES pull up speaker poles, using them as weapons against CECIL FANS. CECIL FAN C throws beer bottle at REDNECK FAMILY's car as they try to speed their car to exit over speed bumps. 
CECIL (Continuing over speaker) 
(PARANOID) .Fans of outlaw cinema - they're here to use you for market testing! CECIL FANS let out a war-cry of defiance as they fight ENEMIES with fists, bottles, anything they can grab as FAMILIES scream in terror, trapped.

(ON INTERCOM) Honey Whitlock is here with us tonight... CECIL FANS yell their approval. 
CECIL .Live and in person! And she's dying to meet you! GROUPIE proudly shines the headlights of his car towards the roof of the concession stand as other CECIL FANS follow suit. 162. EXTERIOR ROOF OF CONCESSION STAND. Lit like a sound 162. stage from car headlights. LEWIS backs out on roof pulling PAM with camera in MANAGER's wheelchair that she is using as a dolly. CHARDONNAY follows with boom pole to record th' sound. PETIE and FIDGET struggle to carry CECIL on "set" in a makeshift stretcher as RAVEN applies makeup to his wounds.

CECIL Honey, I've had a final vision. Would you set your hair on fire for our movie...? 
HONEY 
(CONFUSED) My real hair?... 
CECIL (Weakly, clearly dying) Prove yourself one more time... for your cast... HONEY looks into CHERISH's brainwashed face as her eyes roll back in her head, flash cut with "Directed by Andy Warhol" credit. 
CECIL Your crew... SPROCKET HOLES stare back at HONEY in a fast montage of their insane faces hallucinating credits of their favorite directors: William Castle, Kenneth Anger, Sam Peckinpah, Spike Lee, David Lynch, Fassbinder. FIDGET holds a pitiful fire extinguisher. 
CECIL Your fans... HONEY looks to GROUPIE in a sea of cheering FANS. He is finishing up carving HONEY's initials "H.W." in his forehead with a pop-top beer can tab. 
CECIL .and for me, Cecil B. DeMented! 
HONEY But will it...make me a legend? 
CECIL (Looking out at PRESS, SWAT TEAMS and COPS as they advance toward him and then to HONEY) You will be the eternal flame of cinema insanity. HONEY's eyes glaze over in cult madness. 
HONEY I'm.. . ready for my closeup, Mr. DeMented. RAVEN dabs HONEY's hair with gasoline from can. FIDGET painfully plays pocket pool and lights the torch.

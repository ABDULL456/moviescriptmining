ANNE You'll tell me everything in the morning? 
MARY I promise. 
ANNE No details spared? 
The two SISTERS hug tightly. Visibly emotional. 
The door opens, and WILLIAM CAREY appears in the doorway. ANNE curtseys, gives MARY a last `Good luck' kiss, then goes. 
MARY stares at her husband. 
MARY Hold me a moment? 
WILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms.. 
MARY (cont'd) I'm so lucky to have a man who is content with what he has. 
MARY looks at him.. 
MARY (cont'd) You are, aren't you? 
WILLIAM CAREY smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride.. 
WILLIAM I am the luckiest man in the world. 
WILLIAM reaches for the wine.. 
WILLIAM (cont'd) Drink? 
MARY shakes her head. But WILLIAM tenderly insists.. 
WILLIAM (cont'd) You should. It will hurt less. 
MARY nervously drinks.. 
WILLIAM (cont'd) Lie back. 
MARY lies down. Then she lifts up her nightdress. WILLIAM pulls down his trousers. 
MARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly lowers himself on top of her. He enters her. 
MARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one might not have imagined. 
But one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her. 
MARY looks up. Surely that wasn't it? 
WILLIAM (cont'd) Thank you. 
(CONTINUED) 
WILLIAM rolls over. MARY stares. Soon WILLIAM snores contentedly. MARY is wide awake. Confused. 
aybe this is how it's meant to be. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
EXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust. 
The Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake. 
The SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS, who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS.. 
It's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not, This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end. 
Behind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome, in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough, intimidating lot. 
Behind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books.. 
Then, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS. 
Behind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance, etc. 
Then come the animals: FALCONS, in cages, and the HUNTING HOUNDS, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an assortment of FRESH HORSES for travelling, and hunting. 
And finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of ARMED GUARDS, and a second STANDARD BEARER.. 
EXT. HEVER - DAY The BOLEYN family page, (WILLIAM STAFFORD), is perched on a hill. Keeping watch. Staring into the distance.. 
Presently, he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder approaching. His expression changes... 
EXT. HEVER - ESTATE - DAY Pandemonium breaks out among STAFF and FAMILY MEMBERS as STAFFORD calls out, "The King!" 
INT. HEVER - DAY ANNE is being dressed by MAIDS. Hearing the commotion outside, she rushes over to the window to see the approaching RIDERS. 
ANNE looks out of the window. Scans the approaching RIDERS until she finds the KING.. 
ANNE There he is! 
The young HENRY TUDOR is a dazzling, magnetic, intensely glamorous and handsome figure. A total contrast from the bloated, bearded figure of his later years. 
ANNE You think he will like me? 
MARY Of course, sister. How could he not? 
ANNE turns to face MARY. The two SISTERS embrace tightly. 
EXT. HEVER - DAY The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is nervously assembled outside the house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. Huge marquees in the gardens. Fountains. Additional staff. Smart uniforms. New extensions to the stables and kitchens). 
MARY is discreetly hidden, among the CROWDS. ANNE is pride of place. Visibly nervous. SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH are beside her. The proud PARENTS. 
Everyone bows deeply in deference as the King arrives.

She made it! Exhilarated, ANNE turns, breathing hard. The KING stares at her. The COURTIERS stare at her. 
long silence. Nothing but the sound of wind in the trees.. 
COURTIER Please, your Majesty. It's not safe. 
HENRY turns and stares daggers at the COURTIER, `Silence'. He stares across the ravine at ANNE. Their eyes meet. 
hen he kicks his horse, `Hah!', and lurches forward. He heads down the sheer ravine. The COURTIERS gasp, rush to the edge of the ravine to watch. ANNE goes to the edge her side. 
ENRY's horse slides perilously down the ravine, then struggles to clear the brook, and lands heavily in the water. 
he KING struggles to keep control, and as the horse tries to scramble up the bank the other side, it loses it's footing in T the mud, it's hooves grasping horrifically at air.. 
he COURTIERS cry out in horror, ANNE covers her mouth as.. 
The KING's horse falls backwards, unseating HENRY, sending him flying, and worst of all, landing on top of him as they fall and tumble dreadfully down into the brook, and onto the rocks.. 
Pandemonium breaks out. The sound of shouting voices, cries of horror, raising the alarm. 
ANNE's FACE: what has she done? 
INT. HEVER - NIGHT HENRY slowly comes to, to find himself staring at a number of faces. A PHYSICIAN, SIR THOMAS BOLEYN, the DUKE of NORFOLK, one or two COURTIERS, and finally, ANNE.. 
PHYSICIAN It's a miracle, Majesty, you have no broken bones.. 
HENRY flinches in agony, tries to move.. 
SIR THOMAS My daughter Anne is here. Would like to apologise. 
ENRY (recoils, his pride hurt) No! Get her away from me! 
ANNE opens her mouth, wants to protest, but is hastily ushered out of the room. 
(CONTINUED) 
H 
LATER: HENRY's wound is being dressed by MARY. 
HENRY And who are you? 
MARY Mary, your Grace. Anne's younger sister. 
HENRY looks her up and down.. 
HENRY You've been here all week-end? 
MARY Yes, your Grace. 
HENRY Really? How could I have overlooked you? 
MARY Next to Anne, it's easy to do. 
HENRY Nonsense. 
HENRY sits up, takes H better look. Intrigued. a 
ENRY (cont'd) Tell me about yourself. You're married? 
MARY Yes, your Grace. To William Carey. 
ENRY From Wolsey's office? 
MARY Yes, your Grace. 
HENRY Then why haven't I seen you at court? 
MARY Because I have persuaded him to spend a year or two here first. We have a small manor and some land. Nothing much. But enough to start a family. 
HENRY A charmed life in the country? Away from it all? 
MARY Yes. 
(CONTINUED) 
M 
HENRY Everything I would have wished for myself. But then my brother died. a beat) And duty called. 
HENRY looks at MARY, then.. 
HENRY You don't think he'll miss court? a beat) A young, ambitious man? 
MARY He says not, your Majesty. 
MARY lowers her eyes.. 
MARY But, if he ever changed his mind, I would always support him. 
INT. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME ANNE'S FACE, outside the door: it's as if a knife had been plunged into her gut. 
She turns and runs down the corridor.. 
INT. WILLIAM CAREY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
WILLIAM and MARY lie in bed. MARY is equally wretched. Tears are M also running down her cheeks. She stares at her husband.. 
MARY How could he DO this to me? My own father. a beat) What if we just refused? 
WILLIAM We would be cut off. He made that clear. 
MARY But would that be so bad? 
MARY stares at him.. 
MARY Position means nothing to me. Nor wealth. We could find somewhere. A small farm. Away from everything. 
WILLIAM You say that now - but when you're older? And our children are grown up? (comforting her) This won't last long. A year. Maybe two. And at the end of that - we'll we have everything we want. (a beat) It's for our FUTURE. 
MARY ut can't you see? Do this, and we might not HAVE a future. 
A 
M 
EXT. BOLEYN HOME - STABLES - DAY MARY is getting ready to leave. She turns a corner and `bang', walks straight into ANNE. A tense moment. The two SISTERS stare at one another.. 
MARY I'm so sorry.. 
ANNE What for? You think I want the King? Or to be used and abused by him? (puts on brave smile) No! You're welcome to him. I have my own plans, which don't involve becoming a rag that will one day be discarded. 
MARY stares, saddened, `Oh, Anne', but there's no time to talk. She has to go. ANNE is left. Her eyes blazing. 
EXT. PALACE - DAY MARY and WILLIAM ride through London streets escorted by SERVANTS bringing their belongings. They approach Whitehall Palace. Armed GUARDS slowly open the gates. 
MARY's face: as the heavy gates open. She shoots a last look at the `free' world outside. Then, she rides through the Palace gates. 
`CLANK', the heavy doors shut behind her. 
The outside world has been totally sealed off. Faces appear at palace windows, staring down at the `new arrivals'. 
mong them: is HENRY himself. He stares out of the window. Sees MARY. Then he lets the curtain fall. 
INT. COURT - DAY KATHERINE of ARAGON, (late-30's), imperious, intimidating, Spanish. Surrounded by other LADIES IN WAITING, (mostly high- born, Spanish, and the QUEEN's age). A SERVANT announces.. 
SERVANT Mary Carey, Ma'am. 
QUEEN KATHERINE looks up..`Who?' 
QUEEN KATHERINE Who? 
SERVANT The new Lady in Waiting.

ERVANT Appointed by...his Majesty the King. 
QUEEN KATHERINE By my husband? Really? 
The air crackles with tension. It's school bullying. 
QUEEN KATHERINE Well, then she must be some kind of gift. He must have seen in her some special talent that would please me. Tell me. What special talent is it that you have? with icy contempt) Apart from your obvious youth and beauty? T errified, MARY stammers.. 
MARY I...I.. 
QUEEN KATHERINE oetry, perhaps? 
MARY N-no.. 
QUEEN KATHERINE Or dressmaking? 
MARY I..I.. 
QUEEN KATHERINE Music! That's it! You compose? Or sing? 
MARY ..I'm afraid not. Your Majesty. 
QUEEN KATHERINE Come, you're too modest. turns to a MUSICIAN) Signor Vasquez. 
The Spanish GUITARIST obliges by starting to play a well-known tune of the period.. 
MARY No..really..I beg you, your Majesty. 
(CONTINUED) 
M 
W 
QUEEN KATHERINE (barks, suddenly terrifying) I command you to SING!!! 
MARY flinches. Blushing deeply, her skin glowing with perspiration and terror, she begins to sing.. 
MARY's dress comes off her shoulder. The KING's eyes, however, instead of staring at MARY's beautiful, exposed body, stay focused on her eyes. An uncomfortable moment.. 
HENRY I am sorry. (delicately putting her clothes back on MARY) You obviously misunderstand me. 
HENRY bows in respect, then turns, and takes his leave, leaving MARY standing in the room.. 
INT. NORFOLK'S STUDY - COURT - NIGHT The DUKE of NORFOLK stares in disbelief at MARY. His dogs lie intimidatingly at his feet. 
NORFOLK What? If all the King wanted was coition, he could fetch in a woman from the bath house. a beat) What he wants is YOU. a beat) To woo you. And be wooed in return. (a beat) And could'nt you look just a little happier? There isn't a girl in the Kingdom that wouldn't wish to be in your shoes. 
MARY Your opinion, Uncle. 
MARY speaks quietly. Lowers her head.. 
MARY Mine is that it's the greatest insult of all. 
ORFOLK What? 
MARY Asking a whore to have feelings, too. 
WE'RE INTO A BRIEF MONTAGE: 
F 
T 
A 
T 
INT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY An incense-filled Royal Chapel. The ARCHBISHOP is giving mass, in Latin, for the Royal Household. 
he King sits at the front, on the left. With the men. The ladies are separated, as is traditional, and sit on the right. 
HENRY is lost in prayer. It's not long, however, before he turns to look at MARY. 
EXT. COUNTRY CHAPEL - DAY Meanwhile, a remote country parish church. Far away. 
local PRIEST arrives. He sees two HORSES tethered to a tree by the side of the church. He dismounts. Checks no one has followed him. 
hen he enters the church. 
INT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY In the Royal chapel: the ARCHBISHOP solemnly performs the Eucharist, breaking bread and making wine from blood.. 
But, in full view of all those in the chapel, the KING continues to stare at MARY. 
inally, she looks up. Their eyes meet. MARY blushes, averts her gaze. But then, for the first time, she reciprocates. And looks back. 
This is witnessed by the QUEEN, and further back, by the DUKE of NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. 
Everyone is pretending to focus on the MASS. But none of them can concentrate.. 
INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY In the country church: The PRIEST's eyes become accustomed to the dark. Everywhere, long shadows, eerie darkness.. 
PRIEST Are you there? 
Presently, a WOMAN steps into the light. It's ANNE. Dressed in a shawl. 
PRIEST No one saw you? 
(CONTINUED) 
P 
ANNE No. 
PRIEST You brought the money. 
ANNE hands over a purse of coins. They walk to the altar.. 
PRIEST And the groom? Is he here? 
Up ahead, the GROOM slowly steps out of the shadows. Now we see his face. It's HENRY PERCY. 
RIEST Good. Then let us begin. 
EXT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY Back at court: the service ends. 
Everyone in the Royal Household filters out of the church. But it's a very different atmosphere to when they entered.. 
The extent of HENRY's affection for MARY is now public knowledge evidenced by.. 
..the attention SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK now receive from CARDINAL WOLSEY and THOMAS CROMWELL, and the way in which QUEEN KATHERINE and her SPANISH LADIES are being neglected. 
MARY allows herself a private smile of satisfaction. Surprised at how good it feels. To be the number 1. 
INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT MARY lies in bed, in a room covered in flowers. She admires a beautiful necklace in a box, and a handwritten letter from the KING. We can see from MARY's face how much she likes it. 
Presently, urgent `knock', `knock', at the door. MARY's eyes widen in excitement. The King? 
She hurriedly closes the necklace's box. Tucks the letter away in a drawer. 
She gets out of bed. Anxiously straightens her hair, then goes to the door, to find.. 
GEORGE, her brother, who bursts in.. 
MARY George? It's the middle of the night.

HENRY Do you not know what it is to be lonely in a marriage? 
MARY Yes. I do now. 
ENRY married my brother's widow because my father ordered it. As a duty. To keep the alliance with Spain. And she is a remarkable woman. And wife. 
HENRY looks at MARY.. 
HENRY But I never looked at her or longed for her the way I do you. 
HENRY reaches out. Their hands meet.. 
HENRY Imagine how different it might have been. For both of us..had we been able to chose for ourselves.. 
HENRY leans forward and they kiss. Gently at first. MARY resisting. Then harder.. 
ensing this, the KING picks MARY up and leads her to the canopied bed, and lays her down.. 
They begin to make love. As radical a contrast to the scene with WILLIAM CAREY as it is possible to imagine.. 
MARY's eyes open. She gasps. Her hands grip the sheets.. 
INT. PALACE - DAYBREAK HENRY and MARY, entwined in one another's arms, as the sun rises... 
INT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE HENRY'S APARTMENTS - DAY Several hours later: 
WILLIAM STAFFORD is fast asleep in a window seat in the corridor outside. Finally, the door opens. And MARY emerges from the KING's apartment. 
TAFFORD Good morning. S TAFFORD jumps to his feet. Waking rapidly.. 
(CONTINUED) 
M 
STAFFORD I have orders to bring you to your father. 
MARY stares at STAFFORD. As he straightens his shirt.. 
MARY My father..? a beat) Well, we'd better not keep him waiting. 
STAFFORD turns, leads the way. MARY follows. 
INT. NORFOLK'S STUDY - COURT - DAY The DUKE of NORFOLK's dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by the fire. Slurping hungrily. 
The entire family is gathered. SIR THOMAS, LADY ELIZABETH. Also present is WILLIAM CAREY. 
NORFOLK Well..? 
MARY stares at her husband.. 
NORFOLK Did he have you? 
MARY's eyes burn.. 
MARY Yes. 
NORFOLK More than once? 
MARY stares daggers.. 
NORFOLK You'd better get used to talking about it. Once you sleep with the king, it's not a private matter any more. 
MARY Yes. More than once. 
WILLIAM CAREY's face: a flicker of pain.. 
NORFOLK So he was satisfied? 
MARY I believe so, Uncle. 
(CONTINUED) 
B 
G 
NORFOLK ood. This is where our work begins. It's one thing to catch the king. Quite another to keep him. 
NORFOLK turns to SIR THOMAS, ignoring MARY as though she were a piece of livestock.. 
NORFOLK I want you to keep her spotless, hair washed every day. She must read all the latest books and be able to venture and defend an interesting opinion. She must know her music, must be energetic and entertaining - in company and in bed. That's how he likes his women. And if ever she's in any doubt as to how to conduct herself, or what to do next - she should simply watch the Queen. That woman kept him from straying for eleven years. And the effort almost killed her. 
ut SIR THOMAS has not heard. He is distracted. He watches from a palace window as, in a stableyard down below.. 
GEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON return from riding together. The sound of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the stable-boys.. 
SIR THOMAS watches as GEORGE and FRANCIS walk back to the palace together. There's something in their manner, the intimacy between them.. 
SIR THOMAS's smile fades. 
INT. PALACE - DAY `Slap', HENRY spreads out a huge architect's drawing of a magnificent ship on a table. He sits with SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and the DUKE of NORFOLK. 
HENRY The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty- two guns and two hundred feet long, and with your permission Thomas.. (We notice SIR THOMAS's clothes have become more expensive, grander) ..I'd like to name her after your daughter. The "Mary Boleyn". 
SIR THOMAS looks up in disbelief.. 
SIR THOMAS Majesty! I'm...I'm speechless.. 
LADY ELIZABETH What's to smile about? I'm a mother with one child on his wedding day looking like he's been condemned to death. 
he indicates GEORGE, who dances with JANE PARKER.. 
LADY ELIZABETH Another banished abroad, in disgrace. And a third whoring in public with an adulterer. 
SIR THOMAS For the moment she's happy. 
SIR THOMAS watches MARY who dances with the KING.. 
LADY ELIZABETH But will she be happy when he leaves her? Because you know that's how it will end. 
SIR THOMAS Only God knows how anything will end. 
LADY ELIZABETH God..? He turned his back on all this a long time ago. 
SIR THOMAS stares coldly at his wife. He applauds as the dance comes to an end.

IN ANOTHER CORNER: 
MARY and the KING also clap. HENRY whispers sexily in MARY's ear. She laughs. Then HENRY is called to one side... 
MARY is momentarily left alone. She looks up to see WILLIAM CAREY standing in front of her, swaying slightly. 
WILLIAM You're in love with him, aren't you? 
MARY illiam, you're drunk. 
WILLIAM How is it? With him? 
MARY stares - suddenly hard - punishing him. 
MARY He pleases me. Is that what you want to hear? 
WILLIAM What does he do to you? Tell me. I want to know.. 
MARY pulls away. But CAREY pulls her roughly to one side. HENRY sees this from across the room.. 
WILLIAM I know you look at me with contempt. But I had no choice. Your father insisted I stand aside. What was I expected to do? 
MARY Say `no', husband. (a beat) That was all you had to do. 
MARY pulls her arm away, and goes. She walks across the room, visibly shaken, and joins the KING. 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY HENRY and MARY make love. Two people giving everything of themselves.. 
Hours later: they lie together, enveloped in one another's arms. MARY is awake. The King asleep in her arms. She lovingly strokes his hair. Watches him breathe. 
Her face is glowing. Content. And the look in her eyes tells us more eloquently and unequivocally than any sonnet..

FADE TO BLACK: 
INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - COURT - DAY The sound of groaning. Wretching. Shooting through a half-open door, we see MARY hunched over her basin, vomiting. P resently, she emerges from the bathroom. White-faced. Her hands instinctively covering her belly. 
MARY's eyes widen with the implications. 
INT. KING'S APARTMENT - DAY SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and the DUKE of NORFOLK stare at MARY. Also present are several PHYSICIANS and GEORGE BOLEYN.. 
SIR THOMAS Are you certain? 
MARY Yes. 
SIR THOMAS looks at the PHYSICIAN, who nods.. 
SIR THOMAS n that case...I suppose...someone should tell the King. 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY Shooting through a half-open door.. 
SIR THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK are having a private audience with the KING. SIR THOMAS whispers something in HENRY's ear.. 
(WE DO NOT HEAR THE WORDS - WE DO NOT NEED TO). 
HENRY's face breaks out in a smile. He delightedly shakes SIR THOMAS's hand. OVER THIS: the sound of a voice.. 
SIR THOMAS (O.S.) Keep them shut...still shut..

or the moment. 
INT. MARY'S ROOM - LYING-IN - EVENING The KING is visiting MARY. He sits by her bed. They hold hands and are talking intimately. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: 
This is being watched by the DUKE of NORFOLK, and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. NORFOLK's face is dark and brooding.. 
NORFOLK For the moment he's still visiting Mary. But for how long? The Queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little Spanish things. Not to mention the Seymours with that girl of theirs. 
NORFOLK looks up... 
NORFOLK What we need is someone from OUR family who will keep the King focused on Mary, reminding him of her while she is absent. 
SIR THOMAS is about to speak, then changes his mind. 
NORFOLK What? Speak.. 
SIR THOMAS It's just...I was going to suggest Anne. 
NORFOLK You couldn't control that girl last time. What makes you think it would be any different now? 
SIR THOMAS I've had favourable reports from the Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is quite changed. 
INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY MARY sits up. Her eyes widen in horror..

M 
MARY Why? 
Sitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother GEORGE.. 
GEORGE I suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough. 
MARY But the King visits me every day. There's no need for her. Or anyone else. 
GEORGE They just want to protect you. Leave nothing to chance. 
MARY But in who's interests do they imagine Anne will act? Certainly not mine. 
GEORGE turns, looks all around him.. 
GEORGE (cont'd) Why DO they make this room such a dungeon? Does it really need to be this dark? 
GEORGE notices MARY's vexed expression.. 
GEORGE Don't worry. She's had three years to forgive you. And she's not going to risk being sent away again. She'll do as she's told, I'm sure. (a beat) Besides, the most important thing is.. 
GEORGE moves MARY's lips into an upward shape.. 
GEORGE The three of us will be together again.

A MOTHER pulls a child out of the path of the RIDERS. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT The RIDERS and the WOMAN ride in silhouette against a perfect full moon.. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY HENRY and several of his COURTIERS return from a hunting trip. Several dead STAGS are carried on horseback. The atmosphere is celebratory. It's been a good day. 
Dogs bark in excitement. 
INT. GREENWICH PALACE - THAT NIGHT A dinner at court. HENRY is at one end, in serious conversation with foreign AMBASSADORS. Presently, at the other end of the table, loud laughter. H ENRY looks up, then returns to his conversation. 
It's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner of the room. HENRY looks up again. Then returns to his conversation. 
resently, a third roar of laughter at the other end. This time, HENRY loses patience.. 
HENRY What's the noise? I can hardly hear myself think! 
At the other end, a COURTIER gets to his feet.. 
BRANDON It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her stories about life at the French court. They are particularly amusing. 
HENRY's expression changes. The room falls silent.. 
HENRY I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and she is lying-in with a certain child in her belly!

A 
MARY Or HER, you mean. 
SIR THOMAS What? 
MARY 'm wary of any suggestion that Anne would serve anyone but herself. France can't have changed her THAT much. 
SIR THOMAS n this occasion I am quite satisfied she was being loyal to you. 
MARY Really?

HENRY You're a fortunate man, George. To be blessed with G two such sisters. 
EORGE Yes, my Lord. 
There is a powerful physicality, a sexual confidence to HENRY which he exudes, even among men. He moves closer to GEORGE. 
ENRY Tell me. Are they as different in temper as they are in looks? 
GEORGE Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite distinct virtues. Mary for example.. 
HENRY I'm familiar with Mary's. Tell me about Anne's. 
GEORGE Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say `difficult'. 
ENRY Headstrong. With a fiery temper. 
GEORGE But with it comes great passion, too. It's both the best and the worst thing about her. a beat) There are no half measures with Anne.

HENRY Is that so..? 
GEORGE has tried to put HENRY off. But might just have said the wrong thing. 
HENRY storm, you say..? 
INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - COURT - FOLLOWING DAY A small, precious-looking GIFT BOX sits on a table. 
ERVANT From the King, madam. 
ANNE looks at the box. Her heart misses a beat. It carries the unmistakable royal seal. 
ANNE Open it. 
A SERVANT stares.. 
ANNE I said `open it.' 
The SERVANT opens it. Other SERVANTS crane their necks, stand on tiptoes. Inside is a large pearl pendant. The SERVANT gasps. ANNE, too. Covers her mouth. It's beautiful.. 
But from somewhere, she manages to find the strength.. 
ANNE Now close it again. And send it back. 
The SERVANT stares in disbelief.. 
ANNE (cont'd) You heard me. 
The SERVANT bows, and leaves, taking the box. ANNE watches, a look of mischief in her eyes. She's up to no good. 
INT. KING'S APARTMENT - DAY The SERVANT nervously stands in front of the KING, holding the box..

HENRY She did what? 
SERVANT Sent it back, your Grace. 
HENRY's face. Confounded.. 
HENRY Sent it back? 
EXT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - DAY A ROYAL MESSENGER, in the King's livery, holding a larger, more expensive looking GIFT BOX, walks towards the Boleyn house.. 
INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - DAY ANNE shakes her head, and sends the gift back. She looks anxious. Knows this is a high risk game she's playing. 
INT. KING'S APARTMENTS - DAY The MESSENGER stands in front of the KING, holding the rejected BOX in his hands.. 
MARY is asleep. Dead of night. Suddenly she wakes up, and holds her stomach, `Ouch!'. 
It's the first contraction. 
INT. SIR THOMAS'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME SIR THOMAS is asleep. The sound of voices. A commotion outside. The sound of banging on his door.. 
STAFFORD Sir Thomas! It's Mary..! 
INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT MARY cries out in pain. The contractions become stronger. MIDWIVES and PHYSICIANS urgently do their business. Pots of boiling water. Primitive surgical instruments. 
PRIEST arrives, ready to perform the last rites..

ANNE, who overhears this, surreptitiously adjusts her dress. 
MARY screams in agony. The labour is well and truly under way. Medically, it's a primitive, brutal affair.. 
No comprehension of sterilisation. MIDWIVES have dirty hands. PHYSICIANS use rusty, blood-stained instruments.. 
Presently: the KING arrives with several COURTIERS.. 
SIR THOMAS Any moment, your Grace. 
But the KING hasn't heard. He has seen ANNE. Suddenly, it's as if all sound, all vision disappears, except for ANNE. He stands beside her.. 
All around them the violence and dramatic activity of the birth unfolding; but for all their connection with it, HENRY and ANNE might as well be in a rose garden.. 
HENRY Anne.. 
ANNE stares ahead at MARY's bed.. 
HENRY Anne, I love you.. 
ANNE Your Grace, this is not the time.. 
HENRY I love you Anne. I cannot stop thinking about you. I cannot eat, I cannot sleep.. 
ANNE But how could I ever TRUST you? 
NORFOLK cranes his neck to listen.. 
ANNE When I have seen how you have betrayed first your wife. And now my sister. 
HENRY takes ANNE to one side... 
HENRY I vow from this moment forth I will never lie with my wife, or speak to your sister again. I will do anything you ask..

MARY's contractions build. Birth is imminent. PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES work to deliver the baby. ANNE thinks, then.. 
ANNE Then don't acknowledge the child. 
HENRY is thrown.. 
HENRY What? 
With a blood-curdling scream, MARY finally gives birth. SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK crowd into the room, anxious to see.. 
PHYSICIAN A boy! 
SIR THOMAS turns towards HENRY, beaming with happiness.. 
SIR THOMAS It's a boy, your Majesty. A strong, healthy boy. 
HENRY's face: a boy? His eyes fill with emotion. This is what he has waited for. A son. 
ANNE notices his conflict, and prompts him again.. 
ANNE What my sister has given you, I could, too. 
HENRY looks at the BABY, then turns to face ANNE. His eyes are full of conflict, then..he silently nods. 
ANNE's face breaks out in a smile.. 
ANNE Very well. 
Then, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is, HENRY falls to his knee, takes ANNE's hand and kisses it. 
The audible sound of gasps. MARY watches in horror as HENRY falls to his knees and kisses ANNE's hand.. M MARY (a dagger in her heart) Henry..? 
HENRY gets to his feet, then turns and walks away without looking in the direction of MARY or the BABY. 
MARY (cont'd) My Lord..? 
MARY stares after the KING, but he does not turn around.

INT. MANOR HOUSE - NIGHT MARY sits at the dinner table with her husband, WILLIAM CAREY, who's health has deteriorated. He drinks heavily. A shadow of his former self. 
He stares at the BABY.. W WILLIAM Have you christened the child? 
MARY Henry. 
WILLIAM I see. 
A painful smile.. 
WILLIAM And is he to take my name? Or is he to be a Fitzroy or some other sign that he is a royal bast... 
MARY He is to be Henry Carey. 
WILLIAM I see. 
A silence, then.. 
WILLIAM Well, then, here we are.

EXT. GARDENS - DAY HENRY and ANNE walk through the gardens. Out of earshot of the entire court which is assembled outside.. 
HENRY Well, I have done what you asked. Will you give yourself to me, now? 
ANNE As what? 
HENRY My one true mistress. To whom I am loyal above all others? 
ANNE But it's not true. You are loyal to the QUEEN above all others. 
HENRY My wife? I barely see her. 
ANNE But she sits on a throne beside you. Accompanies you to every state function. 
ENRY For appearance sakes only. In every other regard, our marriage is a sham. 
ANNE Still, she is your WIFE. And ever present. And I feel her eyes on me. And those of her spies. 
ANNE nervously looks left and right.. 
ANNE And look at us. Forever reduced to meeting in secret like this. Speaking in whispers. a beat) Hardly conducive to passion?

HENRY Well, what would you have me do? 
INT. COURT - DAY ANNE watches from a distance as HENRY talks to WOLSEY. We do not hear their dialogue, but the two MEN are having a heated discussion. Voices are raised. 
WOLSEY pleads with the KING to be reasonable. HENRY silences him angrily, then walks out.. 
INT. COURT - ANNE'S APARTMENTS - WINTER - DAY ANNE enters a lavish drawing-room, and sits down. She picks up a book, and pretends to be reading. HENRY enters, sidles up behind ANNE, putting his arms around her, then.. 
HENRY Wolsey has agreed to draw up plans for the Queen to be sent to a nunnery. 
HENRY kisses ANNE on the neck.. 
HENRY She will protest, of course. She won't go quietly, but she knows she has failed to give me a son, and deserves her exile. HENRY kisses ANNE) Which leaves you all alone at court.. 
He begins to unbutton her dress.. 
HENRY ...queen in all but name. Mother to any future heir. 
ENRY unbuttons and kisses lower, lower. 
HENRY So, is this assurance enough? Will you give yourself to me now? 
A flicker behind ANNE's eyes, then.. 
ANNE I'd like to. But I'm afraid I find the insult too much to bear. 
MARY High stakes indeed. 
EXT. ROCHFORD HALL - STABLE YARD - DAY MARY follows STAFFORD out to the stables where freshly watered and fed horses are waiting..

STAFFORD ow is your husband? I heard he was unwell. 
MARY He is. 
STAFFORD I'm sorry. 
STAFFORD stares at her. Their eyes meet. STAFFORD opens his mouth, for a moment it looks as if he's about to finally declare his feelings, then.. 
WILLIAM (O.S.) Mary..! 
WILLIAM CAREY's voice calls out from inside. STAFFORD's expression changes. Now's not the right time. 
He kicks his horse, and rides off. 
INT. ROCHFORD HALL - BEDROOM - DAY 
WILLIAM CAREY lying in bed, emaciated, coughing blood, weak and sick, calls out for help, `Mary!' 
INT. ROCHFORD HALL - CORRIDOR - DAY 
MARY walks down a corridor towards her husband's bedroom. As she goes, she passes a window. She stops. And looks out. 
In the distance is WILLIAM STAFFORD's horse. Reaching the brow of a hill.. 
EXT. HILL - COUNTRYSIDE - DAY At that precise moment, WILLIAM STAFFORD's horse reaches the top of the hill.. 
STAFFORD (pulling horse up) Whoa.. 
STAFFORD turns, and faces back down at the house. He takes a last look. For a moment there is a connection between them both.

INT. COURT - DAY A hall filled with LAWYERS and AMBASSADORS from both sides. Arguably the grandest, most significant divorce proceedings in history. 
ANNE watches from a distance as HENRY talks to CARDINAL WOLSEY. Then HENRY turns. He walks towards ANNE. 
HENRY The Queen has insisted a Papal representative be present at the trial. But Wolsey has assured me the trial will proceed for appearance sake only. We have our verdict. 
ANNE Then what troubles you? 
HENRY One or two friends have refused to lend their support. Among them, Thomas More. (a beat) And then there's the small matter of my conscience. 
ANNE Why? You have justice on your side. 
HENRY stares, conflicted.. 
HENRY Do I? 
ANNE strokes his head. Pacifying him. But the look on her face tells us - this is getting harder and harder. 
INT. HENRY'S QUARTERS - COURT - SEVERAL MONTHS LATER HENRY sits at breakfast. Reading official correspondence. Legal documents. And private letters.

INT. ANNE'S ROOM - DAY `Crash', the door flies open. SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK burst in. ANNE is in the bath. She covers herself.. 
SIR THOMAS `Mary Talbot'. 
ANNE Who? 
SIR THOMAS Mary Talbot!! The girl that married Henry Percy. It seems she has petitioned the King, demanding a divorce from her husband( on the grounds.. he can hardly bring himself to say the words) ...that his prior betrothal to you was actually.. (his knuckles whiten) ..consummated. 
ANNE's eyes widen in horror..`What?' 
SIR THOMAS I knew this would come back to haunt us! 
INT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - COURT - NIGHT MARY is putting the children to bed, tucking YOUNG HENRY in. 
OUNG HENRY Mama? What's the matter? 
MARY's face: visibly upset. Her hands shaking. 
MARY (putting brave face on) Nothing. 
MARY smiles, tenderly kisses YOUNG HENRY. 
ANNE appears in the doorway. Watches through a half-open door. Notes how loving MARY is as a mother.. 
MARY gets to her feet. Walks towards ANNE. 
INT. CORRIDOR - BOLEYN APARTMENTS - NIGHT MARY closes the door behind her. ANNE stares at her, then.. 
ANNE (with difficulty) I am forever in your debt. 
MARY You owe me nothing, sister. I did it that we may finally draw a line beneath everything that has happened between us.

t the centre of everything: an grand, old, bearded ARCHBISHOP climbs down from an opulent carriage. 
MARY ho's that? 
SIR THOMAS The Papal Legate. Sent by the Pope to preside over the Queen's trial. 
MARY looks first at ANNE, then back out as the long procession dramatically enters the Palace Gates. 
MARY So, it's true. It's really happening? 
ANNE suddenly looks pale. Vulnerable. Frightened. 
ANNE Yes, it is. Stay with me, please? I need my sister by me side.

ANNE watches as KATHERINE enters court. The QUEEN sees ANNE, and starts walking directly towards them.. 
ANNE (cont'd) God, she's coming towards us. 
QUEEN KATHERINE walks towards the screen, reaches it, then Q pushes it aside, intimidatingly flanked by her LAWYERS.. 
UEEN KATHERINE So..the Boleyn whores. Two former ladies of mine. Hiding in shadows. (a beat) What did I do to upset you, that you should turn against me like this? 
ANNE You failed to give England an heir. 
QUEEN KATHERINE And that upsets you so? 
ANNE What upsets the King upsets me. 
QUEEN KATHERINE straightens. Big mistake. 
QUEEN KATHERINE How dare you! 
CRIER (calling out) Katherine, Queen of England, come into court..! 
KATHERINE's LAWYERS try to drag her away from ANNE, but she wrenches herself free..

We REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: this is being watched shadows by the KING himself.. 
His face: burning with guilt and self-loathing. 
INT. ANNE'S APARTMENT - DAY The door flies open. ANNE is reading, alone. She looks up to see HENRY, his eyes ablaze.. 
HENRY Now you will give yourself to me. 
ANNE looks up.. 
ANNE I thought I had made myself clear. Until we are married, there is no questi.. 
HENRY Silence! Enough of your GAMES! (tearing at her dress) I have torn apart this country for you, gone against every principle in my heart, I've endured the doubts and counsel of good men and silenced them with the axe...just to be with you..

INT. PALACE CHAPEL - WESTMINSTER - DAY A small ceremony. Held in secret. The distant sound of crowds protesting. Booing. Jeering. MARY watches from the shadows as ARCHBISHOP CRANMER marries HENRY and a visibly pregnant ANNE.. 
ARCHIBISHOP (in LATIN, we see sub-titles) Do you, Henry Tudor, take Anne Boleyn as your lawful wedded wife..? 
HENRY's face: eyes burning with self-loathing.. 
HENRY I do. 
Their voices are almost drowned by the SHOUTS of protest and dissent coming from the streets..`Whore', `Witch'.

A party is in progress. ANNE, the bride, is at the centre of proceedings, visibly pregnant and finally Queen. But it has brought her no peace. The cacophony from outside visibly troubles her. MARY stands by her side. Maid of honour. 
ANNE Did you hear? On the way to the church? They were calling me a witch. 
MARY All that will die down as soon as they get to know you. 
ANNE But what if it doesn't? What if they hate me forever? 
MARY They won't. They will see how much the King loves you, and follow. 
MARY What? (blushing) Certainly not.. 
MARY gestures dismissively.. 
MARY (flustered) In love! 
MARY returns to her book, flicking pages. But privately she is shocked. Is it that obvious? 
INT. COURT - QUEEN'S APARTMENTS - NIGHT A darkened room. ANNE screams out. She is in the middle of giving birth. With a bone-chilling scream, a head appears.. 
MIDWIFE And again, one more..

MIDWIFE It's done, your Majesty..! 
MARY Well done... 
PHYSICIANS and MIDWIVES swarm around the baby. ANNE, despite having lost a great deal of blood, tries to sit up..

ANNE A girl? 
INT. ANNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT MARY watches from a distance, as SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK tell the King. HENRY staggers from the disappointment, as if he had been delivered a blow.. 
SIR THOMAS She has named her Elizabeth. After your mother. 
HENRY Is the child healthy? 
SIR THOMAS Perfectly, Sir. 
HENRY stares, hollow-eyed. Finally.. 
ENRY Well, if we can have a healthy daughter, we can have a healthy son. 
HENRY turns, and without a word, pushes past everyone, and leaves. ANNE is left alone, her heart breaking.. 
MARY stares at ANNE. A stab of compassion. Not long ago the same thing happened to her. Hoping to console ANNE, MARY hands her beautiful new BABY over to her...

Her shoulders shake with tears. 
FADE TO BLACK:

And goes to tend to the crying BABY ELIZABETH.. 
INT. MARY'S ROOM - COURT - NIGHT MARY is with her children, reading them a bedside story. From next door, the sound of raised voices. The KING and ANNE are having a furious row. But MARY is not listening.. 
ANNE (O.S.) You can't ignore me like this. I am your wife! Why don't you just admit it! 
HENRY (O.S.) ecause it's not true! 
ANNE (O.S.) Liar! I can smell the whore on you! Get away from me! You disgust me! 
SLAP', the sound of someone being struck. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT ANNE and MARY are together. ANNE is combing her hair. Strands of it come loose in her hands. Her eyes are hollow with stress. Her skin pale and covered in a film of perspiration.. 
ANNE I struck him today. What am I doing? I am destroying this all on my own.. 
ANNE looks left and right. Makes sure no one is within earshot. Goes to check outside her door, then returns..

ANNE It's not the first. Miscarriage. 
MARY's heart cracks. Takes ANNE's hand. 
ANNE They will take it as proof that I cannot bear children. That I am cursed by God. And should be dispensed with. 
MARY Why? There's still time. You could sleep with the King, and fall pregnant again. No one would know.. 
ANNE he King would never lie with me now, and risk damaging the `child' he believes I'm carrying.. a beat) Besides, he is barely capable anymore. And I couldn't go through that again.

HENRY Anne? To a nunnery? 
HENRY almost manages a smile. 
MARY There is precedent, my Lord. Louis of France did it, too. When his wife could not conceive.

MARY I understand Anne has offended you. I ask only that if there is any regret you might..feel yourself.

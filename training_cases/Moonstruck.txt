"MOONSTRUCK" 
by 
John Patrick Shanley 
Final Draft 
FADE IN: 
INT. ZITO'S BREAD STORY - DAY 
Several dozen loaves of golden Italian bread are standing on end in a shaft of morning sunlight. They are standing on end in bins. In the window, ZITO'S can be read in reverse. 
We leave the loaves and DRIFT DOWN TO a Progresso Products calendar, which hangs from the wall by a nail. The month is November. Various phone numbers and delivery dates have been penned in in a rough scrawl. Now WE GO TO a white formica counter, scuffed and pocked from long use. On the counter, in a rinsed out olive jar filled with water, are three fat red roses. The TITLE APPEARS IN BLACK SCRIPT AGAINST THE WHITE BACKGROUND. 
MOONSTRUCK 
Now WE FAINTLY HEAR THE VOICE of Zito himself, and a low TAPPING SOUND. SOME CREDITS ROLL. 
ZITO'S VOICE (barely discernable) Three times they cancel the order with me, and three times they come back. Who they kidding? They cheap, cheap, cheap. The other bread they get is no good. They save pennies. Everybody complain and they come back. "Zito, your bread is the best." They're like children stupid in school who cannot learn. The water. It's the water. You buy bread in Hoboken, you get Hoboken water. Hoboken water is dry. Ask anybody who knows. Ask your father. He knows. 
During Zito's plaintive words, WE LEAVE the roses and MOVE DOWN the counter TO a calculator being tapped very efficiently with the eraser end of pencil. When the results appear, the pencil notes the figure in a threadbare old ledger. 
NOW WE SEE ZITO 
He's a middle-aged Italian man with a kind face. But it's early in the day, and he's already been working for hours, so he's a little tired and disgruntled. 
ZITO You want me to make you some coffee? 
NOW WE SEE LORETTA FOR THE FIRST TIME 
She's entering a few final figures in the ledger. LORETTA is Italian, 37. Her hair black, done in a dated style, is flecked with grey. She's dressed in sensible but unfashionable clothes of a dark color. 
LORETTA What d'you know about coffee? Gimme a loaf of bread. 
EXT. ZITO'S BREAD STORE - DAY 
Loretta emerges with her little weathered leather bookkeeping satchel and a loaf of Zito bread in a white paper bag. She moves off briskly. 
EXT. A.J. CONTI FUNERAL CHAPEL - DAY 
This is a little Italian funeral parlor. 
INT. THE "WAKE" ROOM" 
A generic little room filled with many flowers and wreathes, many folding chairs, a few OLD PEOPLE sitting and, up front, the star of the show, the CORPSE on display in his gold and formica casket. Before the casket is a little kneeler. We discover an OLD LADY there, who crosses herself and rises. 
She goes and sits by RUBY, another old women. She leans over and says. 
OLD WOMAN He looks great. 
RUBY That Al Conti is a genius. 
INT. OFFICE OF THE FUNERAL PARLOR 
First WE SEE a name plate on a desk. The plate reads ALFONSO CONTI. We HEAR his VOICE. 
CONTI'S VOICE I am a genius. 
The SHOT WIDENS TO INCLUDE the loaf of bread which is half cut up and being buttered. Next to the bread are two steaming mugs of coffee. We HEAR the subdued TAPPING of Loretta's tabulations. 
LORETTA'S VOICE If you're such an artistic genius, why can't you keep track of your receipts? How am I going to do your income tax? 
CONTI'S VOICE I am an artistic genius. 
The SHOT WIDENS and now we can see Al Conti and Loretta sitting at the desk having Zito's buttered bread and mugs of coffee. Loretta's got her calculator going and is entering figures in Al's black, gold-lettered ledger. 
LORETTA If you're an artistic genius, how come you got butter on your tie? 
He looks down and sees the stain. He's at a loss. 
LORETTA Give it here. I'll give you this, Al, you make good coffee. 
She downs her coffee, accepts the stained tie which Al has taken off, and slams the ledger shut. 
INT. ROBERT'S DRY CLEANERS - DAY - MORE CREDITS ROLL 
We are looking at a wall of dry-cleaned clothes bags. They are hanging from an automated grid. As we watch, the wall starts to move off to the left. A gap appears where no clothes are hung. The gap creates visual frame. In the frame is ROBERT. He is operating the grid with a little stick shift. He stops it and takes down a garment. He leaves the frame, heading off to the counter. When he moves away, WE SEE that Loretta is behind him, working her calculator, entering in a ledger. She slams the ledger shut, waves goodbye, and goes. After beat she reappears, produces Conti's tie, says something to Robert, who is out of view, leaves the tie, and 
They turn and look. The man's name is PERRY. 
PERRY AND PATRICIA FROM LORETTA'S POV 
Perry is a university professor. PATRICIA is his girlfriend/student. He's in his 50's. She's about 25 years younger. She's getting her coat on in a huff. 
PERRY Patricia, please don't go! 
PATRICIA What do you think I am, a talking dog? 
PERRY I was just making a point about the way you said... the way you stated your aspirations. 
PATRICIA You can kiss my aspirations! Professor! 
She storms out, leaving Perry muttering to himself. 
PERRY Kiss my aspirations. Oh, very clever. The height of cleverness. Waiter! 
An abnormally SHY WAITER stops. 
SHY WAITER Yes? 
PERRY Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka? 
SHY WAITER But absolutely! 
THE SHY WAITER begins to efficiently clear. 
MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA EXCHANGE A GLANCE 
Mr. Johnny is amused. Bobo serves them their salad. 
MR. JOHNNY A man who can't control his woman is funny. 
LORETTA She was too young for him. 
Mr. Johnny considers this a point well taken. 
BOBO AND HIS NEPHEW EDDIE STAND NEAR THE KITCHEN 
Which can be seen through a serving window. They can look out over the restaurant tables. Bobo is melancholy and philosophical. EDDIE is a young waiter. 
EDDIE What'samatter, Uncle Bobo? 
BOBO Tonight Mr. Johnny's gonna propose marriage. 
EDDIE How you know that? 
BOBO He arranged it with me. When he asks her, then he'll wave to me and I'll bring champagne. Good bachelor customer for twenty years. But who knows? Maybe he'll lose courage. 
EDDIE Heavy duty stuff. 
PERRY, FEELING NO PAIN, COLLARS THE SHY WAITER 
He holds out his empty glass. 
PERRY Can I get another one of these? 
SHY WAITER Definitely! 
Perry takes his arm. 
PERRY May I presume to ask you a question? 
SHY WAITER Sure! 
PERRY Do you have a girlfriend? 
SHY WAITER I am alone in the world. 
Perry lets go of his arm. He and the Shy Waiter commiserate a moment. Then, wordlessly, the Shy Waiter goes. 
PERRY That's very sad. 
BOBO IS CLEARING THE REMAINS OF MR. JOHNNY'S DINNER. He's already cleared Loretta's. 
BOBO How's things? 
LORETTA Fine, Bobo. We'll take the check. 
LORETTA AND MR. JOHNNY 
LORETTA You could use your pinky ring. 
MR. JOHNNY I like this ring. 
LORETTA You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement. 
Mr. Johnny takes off the ring and holds it out to her. 
MR. JOHNNY Loretta. Loretta Castorini Clark. On my knees. In front of all these people. Will you marry me? 
She meekly accepts the ring from him and takes his hands. 
LORETTA Yes, Johnny. Yes, John Anthony Cammareri. I will marry you. I will be your wife. 
Mr. Johnny slowly stands up, brushes off his knees. The restaurant has fallen utterly silent. Loretta smiles. They embrace. Loretta kisses him quickly. 
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN, SUSAN, IS MAUDLIN FROM THE PROPOSAL 
Bobo stands very near her table. She is about to applaud the proposal. She brings her hands together. Bobo's hand flashes out and neatly captures her hands before they can part again. The single sound dies abruptly in the silent room. 
LORETTA AND MR. JOHNNY 
Mr. Johnny is in control now. He looks around once, regally. 
MR. JOHNNY Bobo! The check! 
PERRY AND THE SHY WAITER LOOK AT MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA 
PERRY I feel like I have just witnessed a car accident. 
The Shy Waiter sits down at Perry's table. 
SHY WAITER When I was twenty-seven years old, in Jersey City, I asked a woman to marry me. She had red hair. She smelled a jasmine. She wore black shoes with pointy white tips. 
PERRY What happened? 
SHY WAITER She didn't hear me. She asked me to repeat, so she could understand what I said. But I wouldn't repeat it. Outta shyness. So I'm a bachelor. 
MR. JOHNNY AND LORETTA 
He's helping her on with her coat. 
LORETTA What time is it? 
MR. JOHNNY Seven-thirty. 
LORETTA So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time. 
Mr. Johnny puts on his coat. 
MR. JOHNNY My mother will be happy I'm getting married. 
Bobo approaches with the bucket of champagne. He's flustered. 
BOBO I forgot to bring the champagne, Mr. Johnny. 
MR. JOHNNY I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding. 
EXT. MIDTOWN TUNNEL - A CREAM COLORED LTD SPEEDING - NIGHT 
INT. THE CREAM LTD - NIGHT 
Loretta driving and Mr. Johnny sitting beside her. In the back seat are two suitcases. 
LORETTA What about the wedding? 
MR. JOHNNY My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married. 
LORETTA How near is she to death? 
MR. JOHNNY A week. Two weeks. No more. 
LORETTA Then let's set the date. 
LORETTA How about a month from today? 
MR. JOHNNY Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back? 
CRONE (smiles) Neither do I. 
The plane takes off. Loretta looks after it anxiously. All her hopes are on that plane. 
INT. A PARKING GARAGE IN LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT 
The LTD pulls into the entrance and Loretta gets out. An ATTENDANT appears. 
ATTENDANT Mr. Johnny's, right? 
LORETTA Right. The key's in it. 
ATTENDANT Good night. 
LORETTA Night. 
Loretta walks of into the night. 
EXT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 
Camera frames the window with a sweetheart in neon. 
EXT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 
Loretta walks up the street and enters the store. 
INT. THE SWEETHEART LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 
Loretta walks in. IRV and LOTTE, the middle-aged couple who own and run the place, are having an argument. 
LOTTE I've seen how you look at her and it isn't right. 
IRV How do I look at her? (to Loretta) Can I help you? 
LORETTA A split of Moet. 
LOTTE (to IRV) Like a wolf. 
IRV (getting the split) Like a wolf, huh? You never seen a wolf in your life. 
IRV (to Loretta) That's seven-fifty-seven. 
Loretta pays and waits for her change. 
LOTTE I seen a wolf in everybody I ever met and I see a wolf in you. 
IRV (giving the change) That makes ten. Thanks. Have a nice night. 
LORETTA You, too. 
Loretta walks out. 
IRV You know what I see in you, Lotte? 
LOTTE What? 
IRV The girl I married. 
Lotte, caught off-guard, blushes. 
EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's a big, old eccentric, three-story corner house. To one side, it's got a qated arch that leads to an inner courtyard where three cars could park. It's got two cast-iron balconies. About a third of the windows in the house are lit. 
From within can be HEARD the faint strains of VICKI CARR SINGING and one DOG BARKING. Loretta appears, carrying champagne, approaches the front door, unlocks it, and goes in. 
INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT 
MUSIC 
VICKI CARR is SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM." 
The front hall is typical of big old brownstones. There's a big old oak coat rack with a built-in mirror and an umbrella stand. There are several coats hanging from it. The floor is littered with boots. There's also a side table. 
On the table is a large cut-glass bowl filled with a couple of pounds of hard candy. 
Loretta comes in and takes off her coat. A single MAD HOWL is HEARD, followed by a PANDEMONIUM OF BARKING. FIVE DOGS charge into the hall to greet Loretta. They are totally cockeyed, crackpot mutts. Their names are JUDAS, LUCY, LEO FATBOY, AND JONES. 
LORETTA Hello, boys and girls. Guess what happened to me? 
COSMO He did? 
LORETTA Yeah. 
COSMO That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring? 
Loretta shows it. 
Cosmo examines it. 
LORETTA Here. 
COSMO It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring. 
LORETTA It's temporary. 
COSMO Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing. 
LORETTA So you'll come to the wedding, right? 
COSMO Let's go tell your Mother. 
She smiles. He doesn't. They rise from the table. 
THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DARKENED MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The door to the hall opens, and the light from without dimly illuminates a massive four-poster bed. Cosmo enters, followed by Loretta. He speaks into the dark a calm and measured summons. 
COSMO Rose. Rose. Rose. Rose. 
A lamp is switched on by the bed. By ROSE. Rose is in her 60'S, and is very, very beautiful. Her abundant white tresses frame a face of porcelain delicacy. 
She's wearing an old and richly beautiful white nightgown. 
ROSE Who's dead? 
COSMO Nobody. Loretta is getting married. 
ROSE Again? Johnny Cammareri. 
Cosmo goes and sits on the bed. 
COSMO I don't like him. 
ROSE You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta? 
LORETTA No. 
ROSE Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him? 
LORETTA Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception. 
ROSE And who's gonna pay for that? 
LORETTA Pop. 
COSMO WHAT? 
Rose starts laughing. 
LORETTA Father of the bride pays. 
Cosmo walks out. 
COSMO I have no money! 
ROSE You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo. 
Cosmo shouts from the stairs. 
COSMO I won't pay for nothing. 
ROSE He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die. 
LORETTA It's his duty as a father to pay for my wedding, Ma ... 
MUSIC 
VICKI CARR, SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM", starts playing. Rose looks weary. 
As Rose comes to the table, Loretta in a blue denim work shirt and pants, goes to the stove and gets the coffee. As Rose puts breakfast on the table, she speaks to Loretta, who's at the stove. 
ROSE Will you live here? 
LORETTA No. 
ROSE Why not? 
LORETTA Pop don't like Johnny. 
Loretta returns with the coffeepot to the table, and pours. 
Then she takes the pot back to the stove. 
ROSE So we'll sell the house. 
LORETTA I got married before, you didn't sell. 
Loretta comes to the table. They sit down to breakfast. 
ROSE Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby... 
LORETTA I'm thirty-seven years old. 
ROSE What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over. 
LORETTA Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there. 
ROSE And we'll sell the house. 
LORETTA I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny. 
ROSE No. He don't. 
The WALL PHONE in the kitchen RINGS. Loretta goes and answers it. 
LORETTA Hello? Yea, this is Loretta Castorini - yeah. Is that you Johnny? 
INT. A DARKENED BEDROOM IN PALERMO - DAY 
Mr. Johnny is calling on an old European-style phone. In the b.g. is the sickbed. In the sickbed lies VESTA, Mr. Johnny's mother, her grey hair spread out on a golden pillow. 
By the bed are THREE MOURNERS, old crones dressed in black. 
One clutches a missal, the other two clutch rosaries. All three are grieving in a steady low wordless whine. Mr. Johnny speaks into the phone in a confidential manner. There is some long-distance CRACKLE. 
MR. JOHNNY Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother. 
LORETTA ON THE PHONE 
LORETTA How was your plane ride? 
MR. JOHNNY ON THE PHONE 
MR. JOHNNY The waitresses were very nice. (glances over at his mother) My mother is slipping away. 
LORETTA ON THE PHONE 
VESTA (calling to the Heavens) Quanto tempo devo aspettare? (now she aims more at Johnny) How long must I wait?! 
MR. JOHNNY I can't talk long. 
LORETTA Have you told her we're getting married? 
MR. JOHNNY ON THE PHONE 
MR. JOHNNY Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful. 
We HEAR Loretta's VOICE over his receiver. 
LORETTA'S VOICE Just don't wait until she's dead. 
MR. JOHNNY Have you called my brother? 
LORETTA'S VOICE Not yet. 
MR. JOHNNY Will you do it today? Call him, make him come to the wedding. Five years is too long for bad blood between brothers. Nothing can replace your family. I see that now. 
LORETTA ON THE PHONE 
Rocco slides back the door all the way. Chrissy and Loretta make their way past him. He slides the door three quarters shut behind them. 
INT. THE BASEMENT OVEN ROOM - DAY 
There are two coal-fired ovens, one at either end of the room. There is a large wooden table roughly center. And various pieces of baking equipment, dough-mixers, etc., scattered willy-nilly. And everywhere there is bread. 
PIETRO, a baker, is working at one of the ovens with a long wooden spatula. RONNY is working at the other oven. 
Actually, he is just staring in the open door at the baking bread and burning coals. He's dressed in black jeans streaked with flour, a white restaurant shirt, white cotton gloves, and around his neck, a red handkerchief. He is black-haired, handsome and intense. 
ROCCO Ronny! 
RONNY What! 
ROCCO Somebody here to see you. 
Ronny turns and takes in Loretta. 
RONNY Have you come from my brother? 
LORETTA Yes. 
RONNY Why? 
LORETTA I'm going to marry him. 
RONNY You are going to marry my brother? 
LORETTA Yes. Do you want... 
RONNY I have no life. 
LORETTA Excuse me. 
RONNY I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me. 
LORETTA I don't understand. 
Everything in the oven room has stopped and everyone is watching. 
RONNY And now he's getting married. He has his, he's getting his. And he wants me to come? What is life? 
He picks up the wooden spatula and slides it into the oven. 
LORETTA I didn't come here to upset you. 
Ronny slides a bunch of loaves out of the oven on the spatula, turns them around, and slides them back in. 
RONNY They say bread is life. So I bake bread, bread, bread. (He's picking up loaves of bread from one of the boxes on the floor, and casually tossing them across the room.) And the years go by! By! By! And I sweat and shovel this stinking dough in and outta this hot hole in the wall and I should be so happy, huh, sweetheart? You want me to come to the wedding of my brother Johnny?!! Where is my wedding? Chrissy! Over by the wall! Gimme the big knife! 
CHRISSY No, Ronny! 
Barbara appears in the doorway and comes down the stairs into the room. 
RONNY Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat! 
LORETTA Maybe I should come back another time. 
RONNY No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife! 
CHRISSY I tell you I won't do it! 
RONNY (to Loretta) Do you know about me? 
BARBARA Oh, Mr. Cammareri! 
RONNY Nothing is anybody's fault, but things happen. (holds up his left hand to Loretta) Look. 
He pulls off the glove. The hand is made of wood. 
RONNY It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fiancé saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man. 
LORETTA That's the bad blood between you and Johnny? 
RONNY That's it. 
LORETTA But that wasn't Johnny's fault. 
RONNY I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget? 
RONNY Loretta. What's that smell? 
LORETTA I'm making you a steak. 
RONNY You don't have to help me. 
LORETTA I know that. I do what I want. 
RONNY I like it well done. 
LORETTA You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood. 
INT. RONNY'S APARTMENT -DINING ROOM - DAY 
CU of Ronny's artificial hand, holding a fork stuck in a steak. With his right he is cutting his steak. He switches hands and eats hungrily. Loretta watches. 
RONNY This is good. Uhh... 
LORETTA Loretta. 
RONNY Where'd Johnny find you? 
LORETTA He knew my husband who died. 
RONNY How'd he die? 
LORETTA Bus hit him. 
RONNY Fast. 
LORETTA Instantaneous. 
RONNY When you get engaged? 
LORETTA Yesterday. 
Ronny drops his knife and fork and turns away. Loretta is not surprised and does not move. 
RONNY Why? 
LORETTA Why what? 
RONNY I don't know. 
LORETTA (smiles) So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then? 
RONNY No. 
LORETTA Stupid. 
RONNY When your husband get hit by the bus? 
LORETTA Seven years ago. 
RONNY How many men since then? 
LORETTA Just Johnny. 
RONNY Stupid yourself. 
LORETTA No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky. 
RONNY I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that. 
LORETTA What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear? 
RONNY Why you talking to me? 
LORETTA You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey? 
EXT. STREET NEAR BAKERY - DAY 
SHOT OF COSMO & MONA IN THE BUICK 
The car has just come to a stop. We see Cosmo & Mona kiss. 
She exits car. Cosmo glances around with a slightly guilty look and pulls away. 
LORETTA AND RONNY AT THE TABLE WITH A BOTTLE OF WHISKEY 
They kiss. When they part there is a drop of blood on Loretta's lips. 
RONNY Your blood. 
LORETTA All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny. 
RONNY Loretta. 
LORETTA I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me. 
RONNY I've got you. 
LORETTA Get all of me. Take everything. 
RONNY What about Johnny? 
LORETTA You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry! 
RONNY Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left. 
Their eyes are boiling with fierce animal tears. They have opened their souls to each other and they are coming together. 
The MUSIC SWELLS to a terrible triumph. 
EXT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT 
Dog whines over exterior. 
INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - AN UPSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT 
With five beds for dogs. Four of the beds are empty and on the fifth Judas is whining. He looks around at the other beds. Where is everybody? He goes out the bedroom door. 
THE CASTORINI STAIRCASE - NIGHT 
Judas is running down the stairs and into the hall. We FOLLOW HIM down the hall. The hall is only dimly lit. He finds the four other dogs. They are crowded at a narrow doorway. 
From the doorway comes a golden light. 
INT. THE CASTORINI HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
THE PLEASED FACE OF COSMO THROUGH A VEIL OF STEAM 
The CAMERA PULLS BACK. 
We are in the Castorini dining room. Cosmo sits at the head of the table, a napkin tucked into his shirt. 
Rose has just laid down a massive platter of steaming baked fish. Already on the table is a platter of pasta, loaves of bread, a big bowl of salad, two bottles of wine, and an appetizer plate of salami and pimento. Seated at the table is COSMO, the Old Man, and RAYMOND and RITA CAPPOMAGGI. 
Raymond is rotund, moon-faced, bald, somewhere in his fifties. 
He has a pencil-thin mustache over his small mouth. His wife, Rita, looks very like him, except she has hair on her head and none on her lip. Raymond is Rose's brother. There are two empty places at table, for Rose and Loretta. 
COSMO Where's Loretta? We're gonna start without her. 
ONE OF THE ENTRANCE WAYS TO THE DINING ROOM 
There is an accordion gate across it. Behind the gate, the Five Dogs stare at the people having dinner. 
ROSE'S VOICE She must be eating out. 
RAYMOND'S VOICE She don't know what she's missing. 
ROSE'S VOICE It's not like her not to call. 
RITA'S VOICE Well, she's got a lot on her mind. 
THE DINING TABLE - RITA IS LOADING UP HER PLATE 
RITA I mean, can we talk about it, Rose? Everybody's heard. She's getting married again. 
COSMO I don't wanna talk about it. 
RAYMOND Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married? 
COSMO I don't wanna talk about it. 
The Old Man has piled his plate high with food. Now he stands up, walks over to the Dogs, and puts the plate down in their midst. The Dogs attack the food and each other. The Old Man walks back to the table and sits down. He looks down at the empty place in front of him, a little sad. 
COSMO My father needs a plate. 
LORETTA Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession. 
PRIEST What sins have you to confess? 
LORETTA Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident. 
PRIEST Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta? 
LORETTA I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother. 
PRIEST That's a pretty big sin. 
LORETTA I know. 
PRIEST You should think about this. 
LORETTA I know. 
PRIEST Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life. 
LORETTA Alright. 
PRIEST I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen. 
INT. CHURCH - DAY 
Loretta comes out of the confessional and enters a pew. She crosses herself. Then she recognizes the back of a woman's head a few pews down. She gets up, walks down the aisle, and kneels down next to her mother, Rose. 
LORETTA Hi. 
ROSE (looking up from her prayers) Where you been? 
LORETTA I don't wanna talk about it. 
ROSE Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night. 
LORETTA Thanks. What's the matter with you? 
ROSE Cosmo's cheating on me. 
LORETTA What! How do you know? 
ROSE A wife knows. 
LORETTA Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old. 
Rose starts to reply, but then decides it's not worth the argument. 
LORETTA I won't be home for dinner. 
Loretta crosses herself quickly, gets up, and leaves. Rose looks after, and then goes back to her prayer. 
INT. CAMMARERI'S BAKERY - DAY 
Feminine hands apply the final decorative touches of blue icing to a wedding cake. Then the hands set the plastic bride and groom on the pinnacle. The CAMERA PULLS BACK. 
Barbara is viewing her handiwork, a wedding cake on a stainless steel wheeled cart. She's in the back part of the bakery. Barbara is pleased with her creation. We TRAVEL WITH HER as she rolls the cart out to the front of the store where Chrissy is waiting on a huge man named HARVEY. She hands him a tiny box, which he takes meekly. 
HARVEY See you tomorrow, Chrissy. 
CHRISSY Okay, Harvey. 
Harvey lumbers off as Barbara enters the front of the store with the cake on its cart. Barbara calls Chrissy's attention to the cake. 
BARBARA So what do you think? 
CHRISSY About what? 
BARBARA The cake! 
CHRISSY (without enthusiasm) Where's Ronny? How come he ain't come down? 
BARBARA How should I know? 
The PHONE RINGS. Chrissy answers it. 
CHRISSY Hello, Cammareri's? Hi. Uh-huh. Okay. 
She hangs up. 
INT. A CHURCH BASEMENT 
It's been set up for a church bazaar. There are several wheels of fortune, many stuffed animals, coffee urns, cakes, a game of ring toss, etc. AS THE CAMERA inventories the contents of the various stands -- a LITTLE NUN sleeps in one of them -- we HEAR the Old Man's VOICE. 
OLD MAN'S VOICE I've got a lot on my mind. Things are getting bad in my house. My daughter-in-law is mad at my son because he will not pay for the wedding. 
A TUB OF APPLES FLOATING IN WATER 
An old, gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out, dries it with a towel. The CAMERA PULLS BACK REVEALING that the hand belongs to Lucy, who is standing behind a table with the Old Man and Felix. She hands the apple to the Old Man, who drives a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer. 
Then the Old Man hands this staked apple to Felix, who dips it into a deep metal pot. It emerges shining with red candy goo. Then Felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray where a dozen already sit. They repeat this process. But the Old Man, because his thoughts are elsewhere, takes forever to drive the stake into the apple. This frustrates Felix. 
OLD MAN At dinner, my daughter-in-law threatened to kill me. Things are very bad in my house. 
FELIX Hurry up. 
LUCY Don't fight. 
OLD MAN If I hit the stick too hard, the apple will split. If I am too timid, the apple will fall off the stick. 
FELIX We're supposed to do fifty apples. We only got twelve done. 
OLD MAN I don't know what to advise my son. I think he should pay for the wedding, but it is important that he don't look ridiculous. 
LUCY Don't make yourself sick. 
OLD MAN Cosmo drank five glasses of wine at dinner. 
LUCY Talk to him. 
OLD MAN I will. But I must find the right moment. 
LUCY Did you see the moon last night? 
The Old Man's eyes light up. He looks at Lucy. 
OLD MAN Yes! 
FELIX (in despair) Hurry up, hurry up. We open in five minutes. 
INT. CAPPOMAGGI'S STORE - DAY 
EIGHT NEAT STACKS OF MONEY BEING RUBBERBANDED 
By a woman's hands. The last stack is topped with a filled out deposit slip. The banded stacks are then stuffed into a night-deposit bag. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a bit to INCLUDE a ledger. A last entry is made, and the ledger is shut. The CAMERA PULLS BACK more, and now WE SEE Loretta reaching for her coat. She puts it on, picks up the deposit bag, and sees Rita. 
LORETTA Bye, Aunt Rita. 
RITA Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow? 
LORETTA Yeah, I'll be in. 
Loretta goes out the door, with Rita looking after, thoughtful. 
EXT. THE CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY 
Loretta walks-down the street and comes to the CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP, fidgets a moment, looks around to see if anybody's looking, and goes in. 
WE SEE her through the window talking to MILDRED, who handles appointments. Mildred nods, points, and Loretta goes back into the store. 
INT. CINDERELLA BEAUTY SHOP - DAY 
WE DISCOVER an uneasy Loretta sitting in a beauty chair with BONNIE, her hairdresser about to start. Bonnie is a little bored. 
BONNIE So? You want the usual? 
LORETTA I want you to get rid of the grey. 
TRANSFORMATIONAL MUSIC STARTS HERE AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE FOLLOWING SCENES. This music should convey that Loretta is turning from a frumpy pumpkin into a sleek and beautiful coach. Bonnie wakes up upon hearing this startling news and gets very excited. 
BONNIE I've been wanting to do this for three years! Let me show you some magazines! You've got to get a manicure! And your eyebrows! Sheila! I'm gonna need help! 
SHEILA, another beautician, joins Bonnie, and they both get very excited and start showing Loretta and each other magazines. They argue merrily about what they should do, leaving Loretta far behind. A MANICURIST joins them, with her stuff and starts soaking Loretta's nails. 
A MONTAGE FOLLOWS 
They're plucking her eyebrows. 
They're cutting and dying her hair. 
Bobo is gone. Rose is mildly intrigued with the argument at the next table now. She tries to see past Sheila, to see the man, but she can't without making too big a move. The argument goes on. 
SHEILA'S VOICE I really do hate it though, when you take that tone with me. Like you're above it all and isn't it amusing. 
MAN'S VOICE But it is, isn't it? 
SHEILA'S VOICE Not to me! This is my life, no matter how damned comical it may seem to you. I don't need some man standing above the struggle while I roll around in the mud! 
MAN'S VOICE I think you like the mud and I don't. That's fair, isn't it? If I don't care to... 
Sheila stands up abruptly and flings a glass of water in the man's face. She pulls her coat off the back of her chair and stalks off. This whole operation took about two seconds. 
When she stalks off, the face of the man becomes visible to Rose for the first time. It's Perry, the professor in his 50's, who appeared and was treated in a similar way in the earlier scene in this restaurant. His face is covered with beads of water. He pats his face with his napkin and apologizes to CUSTOMERS at neighboring tables. 
PERRY Sorry about that, folks. She's a very pretty mental patient. 
The Shy Waiter arrives to assist Perry in drying himself. 
PERRY Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka? 
SHY WAITER Absolutely! 
The Shy Waiter heads for the bar. For the first time, Perry notices Rose. 
They are facing each other with no obstacles in the way now. 
PERRY I'm sorry if we disturbed you. 
ROSE I'm not disturbed. By you. 
PERRY My lady friend has a personality disorder. 
ROSE She was just too young for you. 
The Shy Waiter serves Perry his drink. 
PERRY (to the Waiter) Thanks, comrade. 
SHY WAITER It's nothing! 
The Shy Waiter goes. 
PERRY (Rose's comment strikes home) Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you? 
ROSE None of your business. 
He drops his posturing. 
PERRY Sorry. That was rude. 
ROSE Will you join me for dinner? 
PERRY Are you sure? 
She nods. 
PERRY Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that. 
ROSE AND PERRY ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THEIR DINNER 
ROSE What do you do? 
PERRY I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U. 
ROSE That woman was a student of yours? 
PERRY Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was. 
ROSE There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it? 
PERRY Yes. 
ROSE Don't shit where you eat. 
PERRY (taken aback, then recovering) I'll remember that. What do you do? 
ROSE I'm a housewife. 
PERRY Then why are you eating alone? 
The door opens, and the Old Man comes out, in his great coat and hat, with the Five dogs. He strikes off to the right. 
EXT. STREET I - NIGHT 
Rose and Perry come around a corner and pass a store. They pause and look at the Christmas decorations in the window. 
They continue walking. 
EXT. STREET II - NIGHT 
The Old Man and the Dogs have stopped by a big tree. Which the dogs adore. 
EXT. STREET I - NIGHT 
Rose and Perry walking. They exit camera left. 
EXT. STREET II - NIGHT 
The Old Man drags the Dogs away from the tree and sets off camera right. 
EXT. STREET I - NIGHT 
Rose and Perry walking to the left. 
EXT . STREET II - NIGHT 
The Old Man and the Dogs walking to the right. 
EXT. STREET I - INTERSECTION 
OUTSIDE LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT 
Rose and Perry are walking towards camera. Rose stops short, stunned and alarmed by what she sees before them. 
EXT. STREET II - INTERSECTION OUTSIDE OF LAUNDROMAT - NIGHT 
The Old Man pulls up the Dogs. Aghast by what he sees before him. 
EXT. STREET III - INTERSECTION OUTSIDE LAUNDROMAT 
Perry and Rose face the Old Man and the dogs. 
In a silent standoff. Perry is puzzled, but has the sense to say nothing. After a long moment, the Old Man silently steers his dogs past them. He walks away down the dark street, silently disappearing into the gloom. Perry and Rose never move, but follow his slow progress until he disappears. 
PERRY You knew that man? 
ROSE Yes. 
INT. OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT 
THE STAGE - THE OPERA IS IN PROGRESS 
It's the SCENE in which MIMI is standing in the falling snow. 
She SINGS to RUDOLPH. It is a beautiful, poignant moment. 
The snow is falling, falling. Mimi is SINGING her heartbreaking aria of farewell. The lighted tavern window is behind them, glowing with a golden light. 
WE SEE RONNY'S FACE 
He's staring intently at the stage with shining eyes. He wants to share this moment with Loretta, but he is timid she will not feel as he does. 
WE SEE LORETTA'S FACE 
A single tear trails down her cheek. Otherwise, she is almost succeeding in hiding that the opera is moving her. She notices Ronny's hand creeping towards hers, but makes no move towards it. 
THE STAGE - MIMI STILL SINGING SADLY IN THE SNOWFALL 
She and Rudolph join hands. 
RONNY AND LORETTA 
grab each other's hand fiercely. 
At last, they look at each other. She is admitting that she is affected by the opera. He is grateful that she admits it. 
INT. OPERA HOUSE - AUDIENCE  NIGHT 
Audience exits. 
RONNY Let's get outta here. I'll buy you a drink. 
Loretta, still looking after, slowly shakes her head. 
LORETTA That wasn't my mother. 
EXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT 
Rose and Perry stand on a sidewalk under a street light dimly shining. About half a block away stands the Castorini house. 
They regard it. Over the house hangs the moon, cut through now with a sharp grey cloud. Rose and Perry's VOICES can be heard. 
ROSE'S VOICE That's my house. 
PERRY'S VOICE You mean the whole house? 
ROSE'S VOICE Yes. 
PERRY'S VOICE My God, it's a mansion! 
ROSE'S VOICE It's a house. 
PERRY'S VOICE I live in a one-bedroom apartment. What exactly does your husband do? 
ROSE'S VOICE He's a plumber. 
PERRY'S VOICE Well. That explains it. 
The SOUND of the WIND can be heard rising up. 
NOW WE SEE ROSE AND PERRY CLOSE UP 
The rising cold wind stirs their hair. They both shiver slightly. 
PERRY Temperature's dropping. 
ROSE Yes. 
PERRY I guess you can't invite me in? 
ROSE No. 
PERRY People home. 
ROSE No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking. 
PERRY I'm a little cold. 
ROSE You're a little boy and you like to be bad. 
PERRY We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives. 
ROSE I'm too old for you. 
PERRY I'm too old for me. That's my predicament. 
ROSE Good night. 
She kisses him on the cheek. 
PERRY Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too? 
ROSE Sure. 
He kisses her on the cheek. 
PERRY I'm freezing 
ROSE Good night. 
She walks away, towards the house. Perry, shivering, looks after. 
INT. THE BOERUM CAFE - A BROOKLYN BAR - NIGHT 
Ronny and Loretta sit at the bar. They are just finishing a couple of Old-Fashions. The barman, AL, inspects their drinks. 
AL Another Old-Fashion? 
RONNY Loretta? 
LORETTA Let me go home. 
RONNY No. 
LORETTA Let me go home. 
RONNY No. 
LORETTA I'm freezing to death. 
RONNY Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on! 
Loretta follows Ronny into his building. 
NOW WE SEE THE STREET 
Just as the door shuts. A moment passes. Lights go on in Ronny's apartment. Out of a doorway on the opposite side of the street steps the figure of a woman. She walks to the middle of the deserted street and looks up at the lighted windows. 
NOW WE SEE THE WOMAN CLOSE UP -- IT'S CHRISSY FROM THE BAKERY 
Her heart is about to break. She loves this man. She looks up at the lighted windows, her feelings hanging by one slender, slender thread. 
MUSIC 
It's "MIMI'S ARIA"- from the snow scene in LA BOHEME. 
WE SEE THE STREET WITH THE FIGURE LOOKING 
At the lighted window above. "MIMI'S ARIA" PLAYS. This tableau reminds us of the scene in the opera where MIMI stands in the snow. The MUSIC PLAYS and the WOMAN SINGS for a long moment. Then, the lights in the apartment go out. Chrissy shudders almost imperceptibly. Her heart has broken. She hangs her head. Then she lifts her head and slowly walks away down the street. 
EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - RUNWAY - NIGHT 
With a great and abrupt ROAR, a big jet is landing. 
INT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT 
PASSENGERS are pouring into the terminal from the plane. 
Most of them are Italian or Italian-Americans. Suddenly, Mr. Johnny appears out of the shifting crowd, up very CLOSE to the CAMERA. He looks alert, determined, geared up for action. 
MR. JOHNNY AT THE LUGGAGE CAROUSEL 
He pulls his two suitcases off the carousel with one quick powerful jerk. 
EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - TERMINAL - NIGHT 
Mr. Johnny sticks out his hand and a cab immediately rushes to him. 
INT. OF THE CAB 
Mr. Johnny leans forward to the DRIVER and says in a very definite, determined way. 
MR. JOHNNY 19 Cranberry Street. 
EXT. KENNEDY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT 
The cab rushes off into the night. 
EXT. CASTORINI HOUSE - NIGHT 
The cab pulling up to the Castorini house. The living room windows are all lit up. VICKI CARR can be made out SINGING "IT MUST BE HIM". Mr. Johnny gets out of the cab, gets his luggage, and heads for the front door. He RINGS THE BELL. 
The door opens. It's Rose. MUSIC floods out around her. 
MR. JOHNNY Hello. I'm sorry to call so late... 
Rose is a little tipsy. 
ROSE Moving in? 
MR. JOHNNY I came right from the airport. 
ROSE Come on in. 
She holds the door open for him and he goes in past her carrying his suitcases. She closes the door. 
INT. CASTORINI HOUSE  THE FRONT HALL - NIGHT 
MR. JOHNNY Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her. 
The SOUND OF DOGS BARKING comes up and then fades away. 
THE OLD MAN WALKS IN 
He looks at the assemblage. The assemblage looks at him. 
He points at Rose. Then his pointing drifts to Cosmo and his hand opens in a gesture of supplication. 
OLD MAN I am old. The Old are not wanted. And what they say has no weight. But, my son, I must speak. You should pay for the wedding of your only daughter. You are breaking your house through pride. There. I've said it. 
COSMO It's okay, Pop. If she gets married, I'll pay for the whole thing. 
The Old Man lets go a great noise of relief, sits down at the table, and waits. Rose brings him a bowl of oatmeal. 
He is content now, and eats his oatmeal with great relish. 
The others eat with a more meaningful silence. Rose puts down her spoon. She looks at the table, but she is speaking to Cosmo. 
ROSE Have I been a good wife? 
COSMO Yes. 
ROSE I want you to stop seeing her. 
Everyone stops eating. A tremendous silence falls. An old clock goes tick, tick, tick. Suddenly Cosmo smashes his fists to the table and stands. He doesn't look at Rose during this. Then slowly, he sits down. 
COSMO Okay. 
ROSE And go to confession. 
COSMO (still not looking at her) A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day. 
ROSE Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo. 
She puts her hand across the table to him. 
COSMO Ti amo. 
He slides his hand out and takes her hand. Slowly, he lifts his eyes. Their eyes meet. It's the first time he's been able to hold her gaze in this whole story. The DOORBELL RINGS. 
LORETTA It's Johnny. I'll get it. 
Loretta's tone is fatal. 
RONNY I'll get it. 
Rose gets up. 
ROSE I'll get it. 
She goes to answer the door. 
RONNY (goes for the door) No, I'll tell him. 
LORETTA No, I'll tell him. (to her father) What am I going to tell him? 
COSMO Tell him the truth, Loretta they find out anyway. 
Loretta looks at her father. 
LORETTA I love you Pop. 
It's a private moment. 
But who appears at the kitchen door is not Johnny. It's the CAPPOMAGGIS. 
They have their coats on and they look very serious and concerned and timid. 
RITA Hi Loretta. 
LORETTA Hi. 
RAYMOND Hi, Loretta. 
LORETTA Hi. Why ain't you at the store? 
RITA Is there anything you want to tell us, honey? 
LORETTA You? No. 
RONNY I'm sure she did. 
MR. JOHNNY It was a miracle! 
LORETTA Johnny, I have something to tell you. 
MR. JOHNNY I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone. 
LORETTA I have no secrets from my family. 
MR. JOHNNY Loretta, I can't marry you. 
LORETTA WHAT? 
MR. JOHNNY If I marry you my mother will die. 
The Old Man laughs a loud sudden laugh, and then subsides. 
LORETTA What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged. 
RONNY Loretta, what are you talking about? 
LORETTA I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me! 
MR. JOHNNY Because my mother was dying! But now she's not. 
RONNY You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life. 
MR. JOHNNY And you are a son who doesn't love his mother! 
LORETTA And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here! 
MR. JOHNNY I must ask for that back. 
Loretta struggles and pulls off the ring. 
LORETTA Here! Take your stupid pinky ring. (she throws it at Johnny) Who needs it? The engagement's off. 
Mr. Johnny retrieves the ring. 
MR. JOHNNY In time, you will see that this is the best thing. 
LORETTA In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress. 
RONNY Loretta? 
LORETTA What! 
RONNY Will you marry me. 
MR. JOHNNY What? 
LORETTA Where's the ring? 
Ronny looks to Mr. Johnny a little sheepishly. 
RONNY Could I a... borrow that ring. 
Mr. Johnny, in shock, hands it over to Ronny. 
RONNY Thanks. 
He kneels down before Loretta. He presents the ring to her. 
RONNY Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark? 
LORETTA Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri! 
She takes the ring. Ronny and Loretta kiss. 
ROSE Do you love him, Loretta? 
LORETTA Yeah, Ma, I love him awful. 
ROSE Oh God, that's too bad. 
Ronny and Loretta enter into a long kiss. The Old Man starts to cry. Cosmo leans forward to the Old Man solicitously. 
COSMO What's the matter, Pop?

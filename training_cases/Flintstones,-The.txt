FADE IN: 1   EXT. SLATE QUARRY - DAY                                    1 
FRED FLINTSTONE, archetypical Everyman, sits atop his faithful heavy-equipment dinosaur, cranking the winch that makes the mighty beast rip and tear into the quarry wall. 
2   THE QUARRY FOREMAN                                         2 looks down at his wristwatch. Well... actually, it's a wrist sundial. And it's magic time... quittin' time... Millerock time! Now the foreman turns from his watch to a steam whistle bird, and yanks its tail. The BIRD SQUAWKS the end of the workday --

Fred happily discards his hard hat, leaps out of the canvas-roofed cab on the dino's back, slides down the tail and bounces right into the seat of his stone and timber car! He gets up to a running start with the only motor (his feet), slows to allow a "time clock" dinosaur to punch his stone timecard, and then he's trotting back up to speed and out of the gate! MUSIC comes UP and OVER -- MUSIC (V.O.) 'Flintstones, Meet the Flintstones, They're a modern Stone age fam-i-ly --'

reading "FLINTSTONE." We WIDEN as Fred SKIDS to a halt in the driveway of his three-bedroom ranch cave. A moment later, WILMA and PEBBLES run out -- both looking just like they should -- and get into the car. A beat behind them are the Flintstone pets, Dino and the saber-toothed cat. Fred pauses, looks around... HONKS his HORN... BARNEY, BETTY and BAM-BAM come out of the neighboring house, hop in! (CONTINUED)

Fred and company pull in. He takes a giant sea shell "speaker" off of its wooden stand and hooks it to his car door. He leans over, puts his arm around Wilma. (In the back seat, Dino pops his head up, tearing through the canvas top.) Dino picks up Pebbles and Bam-Bam and puts them on his head for a better view. CAMERA ZOOMS IN ON the drive-in screen and the words that America has waited twenty-five years to see in 70mm Dolby(TM) drop- your-popcorn reality: THE FLINTSTONES And as the MAIN CREDITS ROLL, we -- DISSOLVE TO: 6   AN EERIE CARBONIFEROUS FOREST - DAWN                       6 
Dew drips from strange multi-leafed plants. Giant DRAGONFLIES BUZZ AND HUM to and fro. Bubbles rise from a still pond, and weird lungfish move onto the land. (The third one out carries a little suitcase.) 
CAMERA PANS PAST the lungfish TO a muddy shore. With a DRAMATIC MUSICAL STING, we DISCOVER a set of strange, hideous clawprints. The CAMERA FOLLOWS these, then WIDENS to reveal the make of these footprints: A seven- foot tall and fearful beast we will call the Xenosaurus. It looks around menacingly. (Oddly, it's carrying a canvas sack, but we don't stress this.) 
Suddenly a garbage truck appears out of nowhere and runs over the Xenosaurus.

Dazed, the Xenosaurus gets up. As it does, we realize that we aren't deep in some primeval forest, but on the shoulder of a gravel highway. A stone road sign reads BEDROCK 1/2 MILE. ROCK VEGAS, BABYLON & EDEN NEXT THREE EXITS. Now, the CAMERA CRANES UP ABOVE the sign and we see -- Bedrock! (CONTINUED) 
7    CONTINUED:                                                 7 Nestled incongruously in a savage landscape, the charming protosuburbia gleams in the dawn's early Spielberg light. 
18   CONTINUED:                                                    18 RADIO WOODPECKER (O.S.) (CONT'D) Ecological activist Ralph Naderock warned that if new supplies of kibble are not found, our animal- powered civilization itself may be threatened. 
By now Dino's affection   attack has knocked both master and pet to the floor in   a jumble of bedclothes, asses and elbows. Dino begins    to roll Fred across the room like a seal playing with   a ball. 
FRED Dino, that's enough -- here, look, Daddy has a nice dino bone for you, just please stop it -- 
Fred has now backed up to a dresser, where he grabs a brightly-colored box labeled "PURINROCK DINO TREATS." Fred holds it up -- Dino gets up on two legs, eager for the treat -- Fred shakes the box... alas, nothing comes out. DINO "YI-YI'S" again, propelling Fred into the next room. 19   INT. FLINTSTONE KITCHEN - DAY                                 19 Five-year-old PEBBLES GIGGLES at the table as Fred and Dino tumble into the room like Frank Buck and a lion. Wilma turns at the noise. One look at her and we under- stand Fred's romantic turn. RADIO WOODPECKER (O.S.) In other news, Bedrock police report that the Xenosaurus has struck again! Yes, the fiercesome intruder was sighted in the Bedrock Hills for the third time this month. Outlying shops and residencies report extensive looting and property destruction... 
WILMA Fred, stop playing with Dino and sit down. Your breakfast's getting cold. 
Saying this, Wilma puts   a huge egg at Fred's place. Meanwhile, Fred manages   to get to his feet, holds out one arm to keep Dino at   bay. Fred does a big "take," looking out the window   --

Pause.   Dino gives him a big look as if to say, "Oh, yeah?" FRED (trying again) -- Gosh, look at that adorable little female dino -- 
"YI-YI-YI-YI," DINO is out the door like a rocket. Fred cackles, slams it shut, then sits down at the table. FRED -- That animal's gonna kill me with kindness. Do you know we're out of dino treats? WILMA So is everybody else in Bedrock. That kibble crisis is getting worse every day. She puts two giant slices of bread into a toaster. Two claw-like devices hold the toast, pulling it out of sight. WILMA I'm afraid Dino's going to have to manage on leftovers from Pebbles and me. 
FRED (sitting down) And what's wrong with my leftovers? 
WILMA I'll let you know when I see some. 
RADIO WOODPECKER (O.S.) (finishing up) ... Scientists from B.C. University report that the footprints of the Xenosaurus match no known animal. 
(CONTINUED) 
19   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             19 PEBBLES Mommy, is the bad Ze-ze-zenosaurus gonna get me and eat me up? WILMA Of course not, baby. 
FRED That's right, sweetheart. The only thing that's gonna eat you up is -- me! 
And he grabs her and bites her and tickles her. PEBBLES (giggling, calming) I'm still a little scared... FRED Pebbles, don't worry. These stories are very exaggerated. Like, you know, the boogyman? There's no such thing as a huge, inhuman reptile that attacks without warning -- WHAM! Dino reappears, bounding through the window and knocking Fred onto the floor. Once again Dino is happily licking and loving and cuddling his callously unresponsive owner. Fred struggles to avoid the slurping tongue, pulls himself up to the window sill, looks out. FRED -- Oh, look, everybody, the mailman is here -- 
"YI-YI-YI-YI!" DINO buys it again, runs to the door, lets himself out. This time Fred puts a chair against the door. 
Meanwhile, Wilma turns at the sound of the TOASTER POPPING UP. We see that the "claws" we saw earlier were the actual claws of a LOBSTER in a little fireproof suit who is tucked inside the toaster. As Wilma takes the toast, the Lobster blows on his claws, wincing, then looks TOWARDS the CAMERA. LOBSTER Well, it beats working in a seafood restaurant... 
(CONTINUED) 
19   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             19 FRED (taking the toast) Thanks, Wilma... Fred slaps jelly on the toast, takes a big bite, and then something outside the window catches his eye. 
FRED (pause) You invented fire? BARNEY I told you that, Fred. But the coal conglomerate ripped me off. The case is still in court, but meanwhile I got lotsa other ideas -- FRED Yeah, but did any one of them ever put bread on the table? How long are you and Betty gonna live on those penny-ante royalties you get? 
Fred pulls his car hood off of its wooden hinges, examines it with dismay. 
FRED If you ask me, pal, you're just blowing smoke up your own volcano... 
BARNEY Maybe, Fred.   But first... 
He uses the flamingo's jaws to snatch the car hood from Fred's surprised grasp. BARNEY Let me try some of that smoke on your car. 
CUT TO: 
25   INT. BARNEY'S GARAGE/WORKSHOP - DAY                         25 We can still see Fred's car in the neighboring driveway. (We can also see Dino, who drags the newspaper on a bit more, then collapses from exhaustion). Barney's garage is cluttered with all kinds of odds and ends, plus various inventions and scale models in different stages of completion. (Interestingly, a number of these anticipate Leonardo da Vinci's work). Many of the models are made of a strange celadon green material. 
Fred watches, skeptical, as Barney presses the car hood into some soft clay between two big blocks of stone. BARNEY (as he works) -- See, the first step, we make a mold of the old car hood, smooth out the dent in the clay -- He tosses the original car hood aside with a crash. Then, moving rapidly, he starts heaving a variety of ingredients into the reverse imprint of the car hood. 
BARNEY -- Add some lava granules... some woca leaves... juice from two coo-coo berries... 
FRED (impressed) Two coo-coo berries?   You made of money, Barney? 
BARNEY Anything for a pal, Fred -- a lump of coal... bamboo sawdust... eucalyptus sap... a touch of the La Brea tarbrush -- and -- voila. Barney dips a finger in this mess, "tastes" it; satisfied, he yanks on a hanging rope and a giant rock weight slams down on the whole mess, making Fred jump out of his skin.

Fred is caked with dust.   He coughs and spits. FRED Barney, why don't you try inventing a brain for yourself! Look at what you did to -- (CONTINUED) 
26   CONTINUED:                                                     26 He stops as Barney cranks up the weight on a ratchet, proudly lifts out a perfect (though greenish) duplicate of the car hood. As Fred examines it, impressed despite himself, we... CUT TO: 
27   BETTY'S CAR - TRAVELING                                        27 The two kids are in the back seat. Somehow both of the kids' faces are messy again. Working together with beautiful precision, they are carefully dismantling the rear armrests and door handles. BETTY (in mid-speech, driving) ... Oh, it's not that I'm complaining, Wilma. I mean, Barney's sweet, but... well, he's just not cut out to punch a clock. And he's such a dreamer, you think he ever once picked up a hammer and chisel and tried to balance a checkbook? They pull up in front of a pleasant-looking simple little nursery school. MRS. GRANITE, a pleasant-looking 65, sees them from the schoolyard, waves while Wilma and Betty un- load the kids. BETTY No, Barney just keeps looking for that coo-coo berry pie in the sky, and I don't want to pop his balloon by talking about the price of mastodon ribs. 
She wipes off Bam-Bam's mouth with a handkerchief. Wilma does the same with Pebbles and then they kiss the kids, who immediately run into the schoolyard. 
MRS. GRANITE (approaching) Mrs. Rubble, Mrs. Flintstone, I wanted to thank you personally. 
BETTY You're welcome, Mrs. Granite. But we wipe their mouths every day. 
MRS. GRANITE No, no, I mean for all your wonderful support the past few years. It's parents like you that make me think twice about retiring. (CONTINUED) 
27   CONTINUED:                                                     27 From the schoolyard comes the sudden sound of KIDS QUAR- RELING and then a THUD and some CRYING. 
MRS. GRANITE On the other hand... 
32   THE POLICE CAR                                                 32 cuts in front of Fred. Fred SLAMS on the "BRAKES," sits helplessly as Feldspar gets out, walks over, grinning. FELDSPAR Well, Flintstone, looks like today's the day. FRED Sergeant Feldspar, I... I wasn't speeding... honest... 
Fred reaches down to the floorboard as he speaks... 33   ANGLE ON FLOORBOARD                                            33 
There's a box there marked RADAR BUSTER. (CONTINUED) 
33   CONTINUED:                                                       33 FELDSPAR (O.S.) Forget it, Flintstone. This time I got you dead to rights -- Fred opens the box. A scary-looking winged reptile sticks out its head, smacks its hungry lips. 
34   BACK TO SCENE                                                    34 Confident, Feldspar jerks a thumb at the Radar Bird, turns to his rookie partner. 
FELDSPAR Gravel. Get me the radar reading and I'll show you how we deal with scofflaws. 
Gravel nods, steps towards the bird. The bird checks its stopwatch... and then it notices the flying lizard which is hovering nearby, licking its lips. RADAR BIRD Whoa!   Wings, do your stuff -- ! 
The Radar Bird flies away at a hundred miles an hour, leaving a cloud of dust and the stopwatch behind. Feldspar catches the watch, startled. FRED Well, Sergeant, if you don't have a radar reading, I guess we'll -- (quickly) -- justbeonourway -- ! 
A new cloud of dust appears as Fred ROARS away. FELDSPAR Flintstone!   Flintstone, come back here -- ! CUT TO: 
35   EXT. BEDROCK BUTCHER SHOP - DAY                                  35 Betty and Wilma   have just pulled up. We notice that next to their legal   spot, a big limousine is parked in a "no parking" zone.    But our law-abiding Betty in the next space now drops   a stone coin in a parking meter. 36   CLOSE ON THE METER                                               36 
Inside the window we see a LITTLE BIRD. It "bites" the coin to check it, then turns over an egg timer. (CONTINUED) 
36   CONTINUED:                                                     36 LITTLE BIRD (with a sigh) Four years in accounting school for this... 37   INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY                                        37 
It's absolutely   mobbed. Customers push past each other with armloads of   food. Gigantic cuts of meat hang from above or are on   display behind the counter. MORRIS THE BUTCHER looks up   from the chaos and manages a weak smile for the girls. BETTY Morris, what on earth is going on? You giving away Bronto filets? 
MORRIS Ah, my two loveliest customers. It's this darn kibble crisis, Mrs. R... people are buying everything I got to feed their dinos... MRS. SLATE Young man, if you're through flirting, I'd like some service. 38   NEW ANGLE                                                      38 
REVEALING MRS. SLATE, who stands there, impatient and overdressed. MORRIS Of course, Mrs. Slate.   Just take a number. Wilma senses the tension, quickly steps forward to break it with a smile. WILMA Ah, hello, Mrs. Slate. 
Morris reacts with relief.    Mrs. Slate reacts with a blank look. 
WILMA (prompting) We met at the quarry picnic? MRS. SLATE Oh, of course. Mrs. Flintstein. 
She turns her back to Wilma, forces her way towards the counter again. Wilma burns.

38   CONTINUED:                                                     38 MORRIS Ladies, the meat's not getting any fresher. Mrs. R, what'll it be? BETTY Oh, I'd like some ground mammoth patties and uh... some dodo drumsticks. MORRIS Gino?   We got any dodo bird? 
GINO turns, looks at his end of the counter. GINO There's one left -- and it's the last one! MORRIS Good. (handing him the note) Give it to Mrs. Rubble along with this. 
46   INT. OFFICE - PULLBACK FROM WINDOW                        46 The room here is dominated by a tabletop architectural model of a large scale construction project. There's acres of little development houses, then some tall office buildings, a mall, you name it: There's even little foot- powered model cars in the model parking spaces. 
Near this we see MR. SLATE, a giant in the Bedrock con- struction business (but not in height). Slate drinks coffee from a "Boss" mug, listens with growing impatience to JERRY LAVA. Several of Slate's lackeys listen, their heads nodding up or down in sympathy with Slate's mer- curial moods. LAVA Uncle, if you'll look at this unit cost projection... it intersects here with -- SLATE -- how'd you like my fist to intersect with your nose? I've told you a hundred times, don't call me uncle in the office! Now, I didn't arrange your scholarship to Harvrock University so you could waste my time! So stop beating around the bushasaurus and get to the bottom slime! LAVA You'll be bankrupt in six months. Slate does a Danny Thomas spit take all over the model. 47   EXT. QUARRY - MOVING SHOT                                 47 Fred and Barney cross the busy lot, sidestepping workers and animals. Fred does a lot of backslapping, waving. Barney's filling out the forms on the move. Behind them, we see the wide access ramp which spirals around the quarry's sides. 
BARNEY (to himself) Social Security number... dependents... 'how learned of job' ... newspaper ad, carrier pigeon... (writing) ... Personal reference... Hearing a loud SMASH, Fred looks up and sees -- 
48   FRED'S POV - A WRECKING BALL OPERATOR                     48 A burly and rough looking guy named PILTDOWN, he grins in- side his dino-topping cupola, winds his winch handles and then propels his wrecking ball towards the... 
49   QUARRY WALL - ABOVE                                          49 -- where the huge stone BALL SMASHES into some walnuts balanced on a boulder. 
50   WIDER                                                        50 Piltdown's compact buddy PYRITE cackles, sweeps  up the walnuts. Munching them, he balances a new one   in place. (It should be noted here that the relationship  and physi- cal appearances of Piltdown and Pyrite mirrors  that of our heroes... they're sort of an anti-Fred and  Barney.) 
PYRITE Way ta go, Pilty baby. Five bucks says you can't hit one on the fly. 
PILTDOWN (calling up) Yer on, Pyrite -- Pyrite tosses a walnut, which bounces on the ledge.    The wrecking BALL SMASHES into the stone wall. 51   BELOW                                                        51 
Workers near Fred duck as dust and debris fall down. People grab for their construction helmets. FRED Not again... Fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of Piltdown's cab. Barney hurries to follow. FRED All right, Piltdown, that's enough! You're endangering your fellow workers! 
PILTDOWN Yeah?   Sez who? 
FRED Says me, Fred Flintstone -- shop steward of Amalgamated Neolithic Workers 101. 
PILTDOWN Yeah? Well, A.N.W. one-oh-one gives us workers a snack break. So... (a nasty grin) ... I'm breakin' some snacks. 
He swings the wrecking ball again. 
52   UP ABOVE                                                    52 This time he's overdone it:   The wrecking ball flies past the walnuts -- Pyrite ducks  for cover -- and then the wrecking ball whips over and  around the handrail which runs along here, twisting as  tightly as Indiana Jones' whip. The handrail wobbles   dangerously in its foundation -- 
53   PILTDOWN'S DINO                                             53 SNORTS, backs up -- the crane SUPPORTS on its back begin to CREAK and GROAN with the strain -- 
54   WIDER                                                       54 Workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse.   Fred runs to grab the dino's reins. 
FRED Whoa, whoa, big fella -- He calms the beast by giving it a carrot.   As it munches, Fred quickly ties the reins to a post. FRED (calling up to the cab) You're on report, Piltdown! If it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow! 
PILTDOWN (leaping down) You've been asking for this, Flintstone... I'm gonna kick your fat butt -- FRED Fat butt? Hold me back, Barney -- (sotto, very sincere) -- Barney, hold me back -- Quickly the men form a circle around Piltdown and Fred. Barney looks up and sees -- 55   THE CRANE ON THE DINO'S BACK                                55 
It is shuddering and threatening to come crashing down. 
56   BACK TO SCENE                                               56 BARNEY Hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that first. PILTDOWN Why should we? (CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED:                                                  56 BARNEY It looks dangerous. Besides, you can kick Fred's fat butt anytime. FRED Yeah.  That's right. (realizing, a glare at Barney) I mean -- this ain't over, Piltdown. (turning, shouting) Come on, guys. Let's clean up the mess. With much grumbling, ropes and grappling hooks are gathered and the crew hops to it... 
70   CONTINUED:                                                      70 BARNEY Hey, nice going, Fred.   You even got the spare -- FRED Barney, shut up -- (turning) Mr. Slate -- Mr. Slate -- are you all right? Slate staggers to his feet, seething with fury. He finally yanks the car hood free. It bounces and VIBRATES in his hands like a hand saw. SLATE (eying the men) For five years Slate Construction has had the finest safety record in Bedrock. (pacing, angry) Our workers are trained in first aid, our equipment is first rate and our dinos are worm free. And then something like this happens ... I want to know how! A cacophony of voices starts to answer. SLATE Shut up! (in the sudden silence) I want one person to answer me: (waving the car hood) Who's responsible for this? 71   PILTDOWN                                                        71 
nudges the wrecking ball off the edge of the table. It falls on Fred's foot. Fred starts to scream and Piltdown shoves a pencil holder into his mouth. 
PILTDOWN (quickly) It was Flintstone, Mr. Slate! 
PYRITE That's right, Mr. Slate, it was Flintstone! BARNEY That's a lie, Mr. Slate! 
SLATE Who are you? 
(CONTINUED) 
71   CONTINUED:                                                        71 BARNEY (pointing to his forms) B. Rubble. White male personal reference -- SLATE (pushing Barney aside) Flintstone, I have just one thing to say to you -- Fred cringes.       Piltdown and Pyrite smirk. 
SLATE (pumping his hand) Congratulations! 
FRED                                PILTDOWN Huh?                               What? SLATE This stuff you had on your car is the most incredible building material I've seen in thirty years in the construction business! (testing it) It's strong -- (twirling it) -- Light -- (bending it) -- Resilient -- It rebounds, "SPROINGING" him on the chin.        He recovers, shakes it off. 
SLATE Where on earth did you get it? 
FRED Oh, it's ah, just something I whipped up in the old garage workshop -- (quickly) -- with a little help from my buddy Barney, right, Barn? 
BARNEY Well, actually, Fred, it was the other way ar-- Fred hisses between his teeth, repeats the "Slate and me are just like this" gesture he made earlier, points at Slate. (CONTINUED)

SLATE The rest of you men go back to work. I want to talk to Flintstone and the personal reference alone. Come on, move, move... They go out, Piltdown looking furious. 
SLATE (a man in love) Light  as a Pterodactyl feather... why, a  child could handle this... Lava,  we could cut construction costs  in half... in quarters... in uh...  whatchacallit -- LAVA (patiently) Eighths -- SLATE Eighths, right. Flintstone, what do you call this stuff? FRED Well, Mr. Slate, I call it -- (hesitating, sotto) -- Barney, what do I call it? BARNEY (sotto) Fibrerock, Fred... FRED -- I call it Fibrerock Fred -- ! (realizing) I mean, ah, 'Fibrerock'! 
SLATE (rolling it over his tongue) 'Fibrerock'? 'Fibrerock'? (playing with it) 'Fib-bre-rock' -- 
Slate's staff make disparaging noises. (CONTINUED)

SLATE'S STAFF (instantly reversing themselves) Love it... great... has a nice ring... says it all, you know? (Etc...) Slate takes the piece of material, leans it on the table so it catches the light. Despite himself, Lava comes over, examines the car hood... can't help but marvel at it as well. Meanwhile, Slate puts his arms around Fred and Barney. 
SLATE (to Lava) You see this, Lava? All those courses of yours at Harvrock University, and who saves my bacon? Two simple-minded run-of-the-mill nobodies. 
BARNEY Gee, thanks, Mr. Slate. Lava glowers. Slate pulls Fred and Barney close with genuine excitement. SLATE Boys, this is a small step for Slate Construction... a giant step for all mankind. He points to the translucent material. CAMERA TIGHTENS ON it. We see Fred, Barney and Slate's reflections in it. 
The girls' frowns are a great contrast to their husbands' smiles. Wilma's looking at the school enrollment forms. Betty paces, looks at the clock.

WILMA Betty, sometimes you're a little too gullible -- 
BETTY Don't tell me. I still can't believe what I did today... WILMA No kidding. (indicating the forms) Do you have any idea of what the enrollment fee is? And get this... it's non-refundable -- BETTY I know, I know! I just couldn't stand that woman's attitude! But we had to find a new school anyway, and there we were... the next thing I knew, I was in over my head... but why did you jump in, too? 
WILMA Oh, she was getting to me too with all that mastodon snort about her little nephew... and... BETTY And? 
WILMA And... if a friend can't help you do something stupid, who can? 
Betty smiles, touched.    Then reality intrudes again. BETTY What do we tell the boys? 
WILMA What's wrong with the truth? (CONTINUED)

FRED AND BARNEY Surprise! 
Pause. 
BETTY Flowers? WILMA Rock candy?   That's nice, but... why? 
FRED Why? Oh, me and Barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change. 
WILMA (sotto) Not anymore you don't... BARNEY (presenting flowers) Betty, these are for you. For sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall. 
BETTY Aw, Barney... I... I don't deserve these. I did something really stupid today. 
BARNEY Hey. Fred does something stupid every day and I still love him. 
Fred laughs good naturedly, grabs Barney in a headlock.

80   CONTINUED:                                                  80 BARNEY (rising) My apologies, Brother Piltdown. Allow me to rephrase. Tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys... (pause) ... plus the one and only Fred Flintstone! Cheers go up, which drown out Piltdown's renewed cry of the poisoned water hole. Fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down. 81   NEW ANGLE                                                   81 
Barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. He tacks it to the wall, yanks a string. It unrolls. It's a big "VOTE FOR FRED FLINTSTONE" poster. Barney turns, gives Fred a "thumbs up," and as he does, Barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket. Barney pushes his way through the seats, catches up to Fred and hands him the document. Fred takes it, continues up to the podium. There, the Herdmaster hands Fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each other like a Pharaoh's badges of office. 
Fred does a Papal-like wave with these, sets them down, and unrolls the crib notes Barney gave him. FRED (reading, at first wooden, then confident) Brother Buffaloes, honored Herdmaster, Junior Bucks and Apprentice Antlers, a great good evening to you all. Ahem. As you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the Order of Whooping Cranes and Brotherhood of Giant Sloths. But we here have come through the croo ... the crux... BARNEY (hissing) -- crucible --

As your next Herdmaster, I would bring to you the same determination, courage and -- if I may say so -- bold thinking that I have brought to the workplace. Thank you, and ack ack a-dack. Applause follows Fred's return to the floor.

Now it's Fred's turn. He trots up to the line, bowls... another strike! More cheers, AD LIB complaints, etc. The scorekeeper picks up hammer and chisel and fills out the last frame. LODGE MEMBER Congratulations, Fred.

It's actually "dots" chipped into a stone. It shows the young Fred, Barney and others gathered around soapbox racers. A banner reads "Junior Buffalo Day." 
BARNEY I guess so.   You already did. Lava leads them to a wood-sided trailer. 
LAVA Well, gentlemen, here you are. As soon as you're settled, come over to the assembly line. We'll go over the Fibrerock formula before the first run. He goes off.    Fred and Barney go -- 104   INSIDE TRAILER                                                 104 There're two tiny little desks at the far end, separated by a flimsy divider. The single window here looks out over the quarry scrap heap. (As we watch, somebody dumps a load of debris.) Threadbare furniture on a worn rug sits under a portrait of "Our Founder" (Slate). 105   BACK TO SCENE                                                  105 Fred and Barney look at all this in turn.

106   MONTAGE - ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY                                  106 
Now, accompanied by heroic "industrial"-type MUSIC, we see the Fibrerock assembly line in full operation. 
This cannot be described    now with appropriate justice, but it involves a series    of animal-powered conveyor belts, Rube Goldberg-like    funnels, spouts and chutes, and all sorts of gadgets,    gizmos, bells and whistles, to wit: (CONTINUED) 
106   CONTINUED:                                                    106 At one end of the building, dino-powered dumpsters and lifters drop off all the ingredients; these get stomped/ chewed/bashed and otherwise reduced to powder, which is then (courtesy of some squirting Mastodans) mixed with water into a foam, which bubbles through a long sawmill- type trough and is held back by a gate. 
Meanwhile, we see a sample item (in this case, a stone sofa) as it is placed before two "goatasauruses" which butt heads and smash the sofa between the two halves of a clay mold. When the mold is opened and the sofa tossed aside, Barney appears and personally "aims" the foam trough at a funnel in the top of the mold. Pausing to "taste" the mix, he smiles, then shouts -- 
BARNEY Ready... aim... fibre! Barney pulls a rope which opens the trough.     "Fibrefoam" pours into the mold. 107   THE CLAY MOLD                                                 107 gets "winched" unpwards by monkeys, and then an alliga- torsaurus whaps it with its tail. 108   BELOW                                                         108 Presto! A Fibrerock copy     of the stone sofa drops neatly out of the mold, bounces    lightly on the conveyor belt below! It sparkles with     the tell-tale celadon-green shimmer of Fibrerock. As     it chugs along, the process repeats, and soon a score    of identical sofas is in view. 
109   END OF ASSEMBLY LINE                                          109 as a beaming Fred watches, workers easily stack the Fibrerock sofas (often one-handed). Nearby, we see Fibrerock window frames, doors, chairs, etc. 110   UP ANGLE - SLATE'S OFFICE BALCONY                             110

DISSOLVE TO: 
111   LONG MATTE SHOT - SLATE QUARRY - LATE AFTERNOON               111 Fibrerock products are stacked up everywhere, stretching away like the inventory in Charles Foster Kane's warehouse. We see everything from Fibrerock bricks to Fibrerock table lamps to Fibrerock toilets. MUSIC OUT. 
112   CLOSER - QUARRY YARD                                        112 Fred and Barney, weary, approach each other, shake hands as they view the day's incredible output. Other weary, but proud workers gather around them: Mr. Slate is about to address them from his office balcony. SLATE Men, this is a proud day for Slate Construction. You have seen the first pieces of Fibrerock roll off the assembly line and into history... a history you are all part of... thanks to your very own fellow worker, Fred Flintstone! 113   WORKERS - FAVORING FRED AND BARNEY                          113 
They cheer Slate's remarks, pat Fred on the back. 114   BACK TO SCENE                                               114 SLATE No longer will man and beast bend under the backbreaking load of stone and rock and timber... because Fibrerock is so light that even a child can handle it. (pause) That's why on Monday we're going to hire two dozen children from Bedrock Technical Junior High. They'll be replacing the 36 heavy equipment operators, 15 shaft diggers and 22 laborers we're laying off today. Your pink slips will be in your final pay envelopes along with a ticket to the grand opening of Slate City. It's non-transferable, so hang on to it. Thank you, and have a nice weekend.

Pebbles turns, the decision made. 
PEBBLES Okay. We're gonna sing a song with Dino. Instantly, on cue, Dino leaps out of nowhere, holding a straw hat and a cane. Wilma and Betty look at each other, skeptical.

MUSIC comes UP and Dino and his little friends do a dance routine we will call "The Dino Dance." It is a spectac- ular blend of soft-shoe and the kind of dog-and-pony-show gags usually seen in the circus or on the Ed Sullivrock show. Most importantly, the routine includes the following: 
A)    Dino leaps back and forth through a hoop. (CONTINUED)

C)   And finally, Dino uses his tail to flip the kids onto his back, culminating in a big "ta-da" after they all slide down the rope for a big finish.

FRED Oh, no, not now... Feldspar signals Fred onto the shoulder.       Fred smiles, nods... 136   CLOSE ON FRED'S FEET                                           136 He slams them down through the floorboard --

Led by Piltdown, the workers have grabbed a big timber which they're using like a battering ram on the doors of the assembly line building. Suddenly, with a crash, the doors go down! Piltdown and Pyrite stand back while the angry workers rush past them. PILTDOWN (loudly) Now we'll show 'em who's boss! PYRITE They can't push us around!

Fred and Barney cough in the rising dust. Neither one of them sees what we see, which is that visible in the hole in the wall is the Slate Company's granite-doored safe... 
... and right beside it is the Xenosaurus, which now jumps up, startled, dropping a crowbar and a big hand drill. 
Recovering its composure, the Xenosaurus grabs up the tools as well as a big canvas bag and tiptoes away, vanishing just as our heroes stir. (CONTINUED)

As the workers continue their rampage, Piltdown and Pyrite reappear. PYRITE Darn that Flintstone and Rubble... they're gonna screw everything up... 
PILTDOWN Not if we give 'em a nice long vacation... in the hospital. Saying this, he grips tightly on a wrench. Then some rampaging workers rush by. Piltdown gives them an encour- aging cheer, and then he and Pyrite lead them up some stairs to the assembly line catwalk. There, Pyrite begins SMASHING some LIGHT FIXTURES with a club, while Piltdown uses brute strength to snap big support beams which he flings below. 145   CLOSE - PYRITE                                              145

Dodging Pyrite's renewed attack. Now, Barney becomes aware of the activated assembly line. Getting an idea, he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber stamp. Pyrite comes around the    corner... Barney's head butts him in the gut, dodges under    his legs! Then, as Pyrite stumbles, Barney stamps    his ass with the word "REJECT." Pyrite looks back, sees    this, reddens... raises his club. PYRITE Reject, huh? Whaddya say we reject your head? He raises the club... when an alligator swings down and grabs him by the seat of his pants! Pyrite drops the club, howls -- 159   WIDER                                                        159 The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin marked REJECTS -- and drops him. Howling, Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and defective Fibrerock goods.

CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate Freds. Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride -- 
161   BELOW                                                        161 
Piltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into him and Fred! All three of them roll across the floor towards -- 
162   THE END OF THE BUILDING                                        162 where a squad of policemen has just appeared -- led by a dripping wet Feldspar and Gravel! 
FELDSPAR All right!   You're all under arr -- 
Wham! Barney, Fred and Piltdown roll right into the cops, who go flying like (what else?) tenpins, complete with appropriate sound. BARNEY (sitting up) Whattya know. Even got the spare again... 
Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has just fallen off! Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay and Fibre shoulders. Before he can extricate himself further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of the building. CUT TO: 163   INT. BEDROCK POLICE STATION - NIGHT                            163 Wooden bars delineate the holding cells. "Wanted" posters of stone are hanging on the walls. As we watch, the contrite buffalos are bailed out by friends and relations. Wilma and Betty are just now clunking down stone money on the night sergeant's desk. 
BETTY Barney, I don't understand... what came over you boys? 
EXITING BUFFALO 'Night, Barney. (to Fred) So long, fatso. BUFFALO #2 See ya, Barn. (pause) Flintstone, you're dead meat. BUFFALO #2 'Night, pal.    'Night, slimeball.

He goes out, hardly looking at Barney. Wilma and Betty look at each other, mystified... then Wilma follows Fred out, puzzled. 
164   EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT                                   164 Lava stands in the shadows beside his Porscherock. Piltdown and Pyrite are with him. In the b.g., Fred and Wilma drive away. 
LAVA A simple little heist -- I gave you everything but the keys and you blew it -- PILTDOWN Hey, we got the union guys to break in and create a distraction, didn't we? Who knew Flintstone and Rubble would show up, too? LAVA The day after Slate City opens there's going to be an audit. If the stuff isn't gone by then we'll all be doing time until the Bronze Age. PYRITE Don't worry, Mister Lava... we're on top of it. They both turn and start down an alley... jamming together as they do. Lava sighs... then jumps as Barney comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder. BARNEY Excuse me, Mister Lava -- ? I think you oughta know... something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix. LAVA (thrown) How do you know that? (recovering) I mean... ah, why do you say that? 
(CONTINUED)

LAVA Tastes... different? 
BARNEY Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off. (smacking his lips) Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff -- LAVA Rubble, Rubble! We're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City... and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds! If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway? BARNEY Nine days, Mister Lava. 
Barney is tossed outside, landing in a heap amidst the picketing workers of Neolithic 101. PILTDOWN (chuckling) Ya can start by cleaning the street with your pants! Still laughing, Piltdown and Pyrite cross over to Lava, who has come out of the office building. LAVA That takes care of the half-pint. (pause) Now to deal with the half-wit. CUT TO: 172   INT. LAVA'S OFFICE - DAY                                        172 Lava walks Fred from the door into the color-coordinated high-style room. 
FRED (on the move) ... But Barney doesn't want to take a vacation -- he says he's gotta be here to check up on the Fibrefoam -- 
LAVA (pointedly) -- Oh? Or check up on us? Emotionally, Lava turns, indicates a picture of Slate on the wall.

(turning back, another tone) Unless, of course, you agree with Rubble... that Mister Slate isn't capable of running this operation ... that I'm not capable of running it? 
FRED (nervous) Of course not, Mister Lava. But -- 
LAVA Call me Jerry. Sit down, please... Fred complies. Lava winces as his designer FURNITURE CREAKS under Fred's weight, but he only says -- LAVA (offering one) ... Cigar? FRED Why, yeah, sure, Jerry. LAVA Fred, let me get to the bottom slime. Some men -- you and me, for instance -- we're cut out for the big time, the big bucks... (eyeing Fred's girth) ... the big everything. Lava smiles, prepares the tips on two cigars.      He puts each one in turn in a gizmo on his desk.

The Lizard bites the tip off the cigar, practically chokes on it, finally manages to spit it out with difficulty. LIZARD (aside) When they say smoking is bad for your health, they're not kidding...

LAVA ... Now, I know your pal Barney had a small part in the preliminary research and development of Fibrerock... FRED Well, actually, I wouldn't say small part... I'd say... LAVA Yes? FRED ... Kind of a medium-sized... well, almost medium-sized... well, really a semi-partial assistant counsulting type, of -- LAVA (giving Fred a playful punch) You're too kind, Flintstone, that's what I like about you. But you're a big guy with a big decision to make. Are you gonna keep covering for Barney, keep pulling his acornsauruses out of the fire... or are you going to concentrate on your own important duties? FRED Well, gee, that's tough one -- (pause) -- Uh, what are my important duties? LAVA Publicity, Flintstone, publicity! (MORE) (CONTINUED)

Lava throws the door open.        Fred's jaw drops as he sees -- 
FRED R-rockin' Leach? Indeed, it is he, and he smiles, extends his hands. 
LEACH 'Ello,  Fred. I've 'eard a lot h'about  you from Mister Lava. H'at's  why we're going to put you on our  program. FRED M-me?   On -- on television? LAVA (patting his back, sotto) Right, Fred. As long as you forget all this nonsense about Barney. FRED (still in a dazed thrill) Barney who?

Three big dino-mounted trucks are parked in front. You have to read the words on all three: "ROCKSTYLES OF..." "THE RICH..." "AND FAMOUS." 
Technicians roll out gear, set up big spotlights, etc.

LAVA (looking into her eyes) Yes. I think so, too. (smiling) Imagine how good you'd look with a senior executive. 
WILMA Oh?   Is Fred getting promoted? Lava laughs, sure she's kidding... then not so sure. The ventriloquist finishes to scattered applause. The kid bows, gets up... splashes across puddles of water on the stage area. The Headmistress of L'ecole Superior et al steps up. Behind her, the picture window displays the expanse of Slate City: The twin Slatescrapers framing endless rows of little tract houses stretching to the distant volcanic ridge. HEADMISTRESS (as applause dies) Sank you, ladies and gentlemen. An' sank you, Monsieur Slate for zis lovely setting. Zoot alors, zis will ze mos' fantas'tic recital in Bedrock 'istoree. Now, I would like to sank out mos' generous benefactress, Madame Slate for her fine support o'vair zee years -- She gestures into the audience, where Mrs. Slate stands, waves a gloved hand like the Queen Mother. 
HEADMISTRESS -- An' now, what better introduction could we 'ave for Mrs. Slate's vairy own gran' nephew... Poindexter Lava! She steps aside. Curtain rises on little Poindexter. He is carrying a leather-and-bone accordion. He begins to play: POINDEXTER (singing loudly) 'Dino of Spain, I adore you Right from the moment I saw you -- ' 
218   QUICK SHOTS - AUDIENCE                                       218 Their smiles become fixed. (Up on the spotlights, the little birds who operate the lights put earplugs in their ears.) In the wings with Pebbles and Bam-Bam, DINO MOANS, hides his head under his paws. 
On the refreshment table, GLASSES CRACK... a cake falls. 219   CLOSE ON LAVA                                                219

BARNEY We just tell Mister Slate that all 500 acres of his development are going to crumble into dust any minute. (holds up the flit gun) Then we zap the stairs and corridors with some of this coo-coo sap. I just hope we have enough to get everybody out -- whoops! 
He's said this last because as he held up the flit gun, the handle whacked the back of Fred's monster costume, and the head has flipped down with a solid "clink."

Barney gets up on his knees, grabs the wheel with one hand and the monster head with the other. BARNEY Hang on, hang on -- 
Oops. He rotates the head completely around. Fred flails around. Barney grabs the wheel with one hand, tries to help Fred with the other. 
223   EXT. CAR - NIGHT                                               223 It careens around even more wildly now.      There's several near collisions. CUT TO: 224   EXT. "ROCKDONALD'S" RESTAURANT - NIGHT                         224 "Rockdonald's" is, of course, complete with golden arches of stone, a drive-up window, etc. It even has the oblig- atory cops on a break... in this case, Feldspar and Gravel. They're sitting in their patrol car eating from little bamboo containers shaped just like McDonald's Styrofoam. (Of course, the logo on the building behind them proudly reads "OVER 100 SOLD.") FELDSPAR (mouth full, bitching) Speed traps again! Face it, Gravel. I'm in a rut... and meanwhile, the guys who went through the academy with me, they're all big shots now: Sam Slate... Dirty Harock... Magma, P.I. And you know why? 'Cause they got the breaks, that's why! 
Suddenly both officers react to the sound of SKIDDING TIRES and HONKING HORNS. They look out their window at -- 225   FRED AND BARNEY - DRIVING PAST                                 225 
both still battling the wheel and the resistant costume head. (By now their gyrations have put Barney's face inside the jaws of the monster mask.) 
226   BACK TO SCENE                                              226 GRAVEL S-sarge, d-did you see that? Some sorta creature was attacking that little guy -- ! FELDSPAR There's a lesson there, Gravel... never pick up hitchhikers. Besides -- (realizing) -- Did you say 'creature'? 
React, furious, jump out of their seats. BETTY A circus, huh? Well, if our kids belong in a circus with their act, then your little nephew belongs in a zoo with his -- WILMA Yeah -- a zoo where the animals are dead -- because if they aren't, they will be! MRS. SLATE Why, how dare you! Mrs. Flintstein, I'll have you know that my little Poindexter has been trained by the finest tutors! Poindexter! Show them! Encore! 
The kid jumps up, begins to play. Immediately another GLASS SHATTERS. But then the CEILING FIXTURES CRACK, and then the PICTURE WINDOW PANELS begin to SHATTER one by one. 
MRS. SLATE (alarmed) Ah... Poindexter... that's enough ... Poindexter...? 
The kids stops... But another WINDOW PANEL EXPLODES. Then one of the tables collapses. 
Pause. Every head in the room swivels around and stares at Poindexter. Nervous, he tosses the accordion aside. But the destruction continues: Another WINDOW PANEL SHATTERS. Then, the entire building shakes. 
237   SLATE                                                         237 Loses his balance, grabs onto Lava for support, ends up pulling him down, too. Slate gets to his knees and looks out the window... and his jaw drops in astonishment. 238   HIS POV - SLATE CITY                                       238 
In the distance, with a CRACKLING ROAR, the little rows of Fibrerock tract houses are falling like dominoes in a wave that is rolling toward the Slate Needle. 239   SLATE CITY DEVELOPMENT - NIGHT                             239 
A flashlight beam  rakes the CAMERA. Feldspar, shotgun in one hand, light  in the other, looks around cautiously. (The shotgun has a  slingshot mechanism; the flashlight is a mirror-backed  candle.) 
Behind him, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.   Feldspar tenses, but it's -- GRAVEL No sign of the driver... FELDSPAR You kidding? By now he's a couple of shinbones and a belch. Gravel drops down on one knee, excited.   He shines his light on Fred's big "clawprints." GRAVEL Holy cowasaurus! Look how deep these tracks are! That xeno thing must weigh a ton! They aim their lights at the tracks, begin to follow them. Suddenly they round a corner and come face to face with -- 240   NEW ANGLE - FRED                                           240 
He's stopped between two sample homes to wrestle with the monster head again. Now, he freezes in twin flash- light beams! 
FELDSPAR Okay, lizard, reach for the sky! Fred hesitates... then, hearing a CREAK and GROAN, he looks at the HOUSE beside him. The stucco-like exterior of Fibrerock is beginning to crumble.

It collapses totally, falling in on itself, obscuring Fred. Finally the last TIMBER DROPS. Pause. Fred staggers out of the rubble, realizes that the impact has knocked the monster mask off his head and back on its hinges. He rubs dust out of his eyes, turns and looks at the Slate Needle. He's much closer to it now. 
Quickly, he runs toward it. CUT TO:

I had these guys pull jobs for me all over town disguised as a monster... but it still wasn't enough... and when I saw all those coo-coo berries being delivered every day, I guess I just lost my head... I figured with the Woca sap in the Fibremix, the berry juice as superfluous... SLATE I'll tell you what's superfluous, Lava... your liver! So why don't we remove it -- !

It's actually a wheeled carriage carrying a firesaurus, which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred- ibly long neck. The bony plates on the creature's back make perfect stairs. 
However, the creature is noticeably listless and uncooperative. 
FIRE CHIEF Come on, come on, what's the hold up -- ? FIREFIGHTER It's the kibble crisis, sir -- the firesauruses have been on half-rations for a month! Above them, the BUILDING SHUDDERS again. 
257   IN THE SLATE NEEDLE                                        257 Now, the remaining LIGHT FIXTURES CRASH down. When they hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire spreads. WILMA (pointing) Fred!   There's a fire hose -- ! 
Indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked FIRE HOSE--IN CASE OF EMERGENCY BREAK GLASS. Fred and Barney take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and cuts them off. Helpless, they step back. 
With a THUNDEROUS ROAR, the two SLATE SCRAPERS visible through what's left of the picture window COLLAPSE. Then the big statue of Slate just outside the window begins to decompose. It falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well, life-sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose, CRASHES through the only remaining pane of GLASS here ... rolls up to Slate's feet. 
Pause. Everyone looks at everyone else. This is it: Titanic time. Fred embraces Wilma... Barney embraces Betty. Their kids are pulled into the clinch. Even Slate takes Mrs. Slate's hand. Talk about grace under pressure... and speaking of -- 258   GRACE                                                         258 -- the star fashion model, suddenly her Fibrethread costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little animal print undies. 259   BETTY                                                         259 
In the middle of going down with the ship, she turns Bam-Bam's face away from this display. 
BAM-BAM D-dad, are we gonna be okay? BARNEY (pause; false smile) Sure, pal. We just gotta wait for the fire department. Right, Fred? FRED Y-yeah. Everything's gonna be just -- Whoa, hoo-hah, aggh -- (CONTINUED) 
259   CONTINUED:                                                     259 He's started yelping because he's realized his arm    is on fire, and now he jumps up and the others begin    beating at the arm with anything in their hands, and then    Fred suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with    a small flame flickering on his forearm like a Rock Vegas    stage magician. 
FRED -- Wait a minute -- I don't feel anything at all -- 
With his other "claw" he slaps tentatively at the flames, and then confidentially snuffs it out. BARNEY It must be the suit, Fred -- old Bedrock High built them things to last -- Fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose. As everyone gets the same idea, Dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth. All brighten. 
Barney helps Fred with the head, twists it into place. BARNEY (rapping on the head) -- Okay? FRED Hist hust fine! He lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks at him harmlessly. Then with his claw, he SMASHES the amber GLASS -- 
260   IN THE BOX                                                     260 A big PYTHONSAURUS is curled up inside,     SNORING. (Note to herpetologists: The pythonosaurus is      not quite a snake: it has little vestigial forepaws      the better to emote with. Right now the snoring head      is in those little paws.) 
The Pythonsaurus stirs, looks at Fred, "sniffs" the smoke. Then he raises one hand and finger as if to say "one moment." Then the pythonsaurus turns his head towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages, slurps loudly. 
We hear gallons and gallons of WATER GURGLING away... 
(CONTINUED) 
270   CONTINUED:                                                 270 WILMA Oh, Fred -- that's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard! They kiss... she drops to safety...! 
271   BELOW                                                      271 
Wilma slides into a rescue net, gets on unsteady feet next to Betty. 
272   BACK UPSTAIRS                                             272 FRED Lhet's dogh it! 
Their kids on their backs, Fred and Barney exchange a heroic forearm-to-forearm gladiator-type handshake... both put their hands on the cable... and then the whole pulley mechanism falls right down between them and through the hole! A second later, the entire remaining structure collapses! 273   BELOW                                                      273 Everyone reacts in horror -- 274   ABOVE                                                      274 
Dust and smoke clear. When we can see again, well, it's not a pretty sight. The entire fibresphere is gone. All that's left, teetering on two spindly supports, are two tiny islands of safety connected by a twisted maze of rubble too small for a human to negotiate... and all that's holding that up is a long guide wire leading to the ground! 
275   CLOSER                                                     275 Figures on one of the islands stir: Fred. Barney. Bam-Bam... Pebbles! The platform shudders again. Barney aims the flit gun -- empty! The dads hold on to the kids. It's all they can do. 276   BELOW                                                      276 
Wilma and Betty gasp... what can be done? 277   THE SECOND ISLAND                                         277 
Bricks and chunks of Fibre stir... a form sits up... it's -- Dino! He looks around at the situation, becomes agitated... he wants to help... but how? 
278   WILMA AND BETTY                                            278 Suddenly become inspired. 
BETTY W-wilma... those hoops of bamboo... those wires... do you think -- ? 
WILMA Yes! Yes! Betty, we have to try it -- ! Dino! Dino, look down here -- ! 
279   DINO                                                         279 Obeys, puzzled -- 
280   HIS POV - WILMA AND BETTY                                  280 
Amazingly, they grab scraps of wood, borrow fire fighter's helmets, and begin to do a buck and wing. WILMA   AND   BETTY You can keep   the   twist, the frug and   hop I don't need   to shimmy, I don't need   to bop -- 281   BIG CAMERA PUSH - DINO                                     281 MUSIC COMES UP DRAMATICALLY as he catches on! His eyes fill with courage and he charges toward the spindly bridge that leads to his master and friends. 282   ANOTHER ANGLE                                              282 
Dino dives through the hoops of bamboo, duplicating his steps in "The Dino Dance." He reaches the other island! Without a beat, still keeping time, he puts the two kids on his shoulders, just like in the dance! Then he "presents" his tail to Fred -- Fred hands his tail to Barney -- and then -- 
283   LONG SHOT                                                    283 -- Dino slides down the long wire, carrying everyone to safety! They all plow into the biggest rescue net as Wilma and Betty wind up! 
WILMA AND BETTY Yes, I don't need to shimmy, I don't need to bop 'Cause I'm doin', doin', doin' THE IGNEOUS ROCK! 
284   FRED                                                         284 rolls out of the net and away from the others. He's slightly stunned, still in the suit. He sits up... suddenly lights snap on all around him! Fred looks up and sees -- 285   HIS POV - CORDON OF POLICE OFFICERS                       285 
All with weapons aimed right at him. Spotlights on the police car roofs (actually little fires with parabolic mirrors) are operated by uniformed monkeys.

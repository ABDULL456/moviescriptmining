INT. BURBANK HOLIDAY INN/BANQUET ROOM - THAT MOMENT 
FRANK steps into a CLOSE UP and holding a mic, says: 
FRANK Respect the cock and tame the cunt, boys. 
REVERSE, THAT MOMENT. The crowd of fifty GUYS who are taking the "Seduce and Destroy Seminar" that Frank is teaching today laugh and play along; 
Frank is on a slightly elevated stage.  vBehind him a huge banner for, "Seduce and Destroy," whose logo is a scared pussycat and a large wolf with a big buldge in his fur.  It reads: "No Pussy Has Nine Lives". 
FRANK And you did hear me right.  Tame it. Take it on, head first -- with your skills at work and say, "No.  You will not control me.  You will not take my soul and you will not win this game." 'cause it is a game, guys, you wanna think it's not -- go back to the schoolyard and have a crush on Mary Jane -- respect the cock -- you are embedding this thought: I'm in charge.  I'm the one who says yes, no, now or here.  Shit, man.  Sad but true. Sad But True.  And you wanna know what? It must be the way. The thing about chicks and the thing about this course that we're going through today is how universal the whole thing is.  I mean: I wish I could sit here and say that it's not -- because the reality? If each chick had something new, something really new that I'd never seen before? Fuckin' hell: I'd be in the money!  Because I'd have to create a hundred new cassettes, a hundred new books, a hundred new seminars and hundred new videos just to deal with each and every situation a chick could create - but that is just not the case.  They are universal. They are sheep. They are to be studied and watched -- they have patterns that must be stopped, interupted and resisted. I'd be makin' a fuckin' butt load if they were actually as much of a challenge as they want you to think they are! Reality: They Are All The Same. Each and every one of them.  And once you learn these methods: You're Set.  You Don't Have To Come Back. That's it. In solid. Boom.  Done.  Over.  Why? Because all women are the same.  Period. End of discussion.  Sorry.  It's true.  Sad But True. And anyone who wants to say that these methods we work by are "unfair?"  Yes, they are. Guilty as charged.  And so's the world. It's a harsh, hard unfair place, but it's not gonna stop me from getting my fair shair of hair pie -- Period.  Sorry.  End of discussion.

Fuck it, if you reach into your packet, you'll see I've been nice enough to include one, 'cause that's the kind of prick I am -- You're gonna need this calendar and I know it sounds like a small thing, but having it makes all the difference in the world: If you meet a girl and you're gonna work an A-3 Interuption -- let's say an eight day waiting period before the next call -- how you gonna know when those eight days are up?  Buy a calendar. Next move?  Mark the calendar. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  What did I pay my eight hundred dollars for?  To hear Frank tell me to buy a calendar and mark it?  Just stick with me and stick by the calendar.  Mark it up -- use it to set goals -- If you wanna make that "friend" something else -- you gotta be hard on yourself, set goals: (beat, to audience) You, there: And What's Your Name?

GWENOVIER Sorry I'm late -- 
CAMERAMAN -- we're all set upstairs. 
LINDA -- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts -- 
DR. LANDON We can fix that, because I can give you -- are you listening? 
LINDA I'm listening.  I'm getting better. 
DR. LANDON Do you wanna sit down? 
LINDA I need to sit down. 
DR. LANDON Ok. Linda:  Earl is not gonna make it. He's dying. He is.  He is dying very, very rapidly -- 
She breaks a bit more. 
DR. LANDON Now the thing here is making that experience as painless and easy as possible for him, you understand?  Now you need to get in touch with Hospice care because they can take care of all those practical things that you're asking me about -- they are who you call when he dies. 
He writes a number on his bussiness card, hands it over as they speak; 
DR. LANDON This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda.  I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away -- 
LINDA -- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that -- 
DR. LANDON The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right?  You understand?

CUT TO: 
INT. HOLIDAY INN SUITE - THAT MOMENT 
Frank and Gwenovier doing the telvision interview. CAMERA DOLLIES IN SLOW ON EACH: 
FRANK -- that's right, that's right, and what I'M saying, that none of my competitors can say is this:  That there is no need for insight or understanding.  Things of the past! Gone, Over, Done. Do you realize how fucking miraculous this is? How fucking razor sharp and cutting edge and ahead of it's time this concept is?  I'm talking about eliminating insight and understanding as human values.  GOD DAMN I'M GOOD.  There is no need for INSIGHT.  There is no need for UNDERSTANDING.  I have found a way to take any subjective human experience -- in other words -- all the terrible shit or all the great shit that you've had happen to you in your life -- and quickly and easily transform it in the unconscious mind through the subtle and cunning use of language.  The "listener-patient" (in other words: The Chick) settles into a very light, very delicate, conversationally induced state: NOT A TRANCE, mind you, but a STATE. A state that is brand new.  The System's state. What did I do?  I REALIZED that concept and put it into practical "get my dick hard and fuck it" use. I'm gonna build a state for the seducer and the seducee to live, vote, breath, pay takes and party 'till dawn.  I'm gonna teach methods of language that will help anyone get a piece of ass, tit and tail -- 
GWENOVIER Let's talk about -- 
FRANK I just realized this is for television, isn't it?  I can't swear up and down like I just did. 
GWENOVIER It's fine.  I can bleep it out.

GWENOVIER -- let's talk more about your background -- 
FRANK Muffy -- coffee? 
Muffy moves to pour a cup, Gwen looks down at her clipboard, then: 
GWENOVIER I'm confused about your past is the thing. 
FRANK Is that still lingering? 
GWENOVIER -- just to clarify -- 
FRANK So boring, so useless -- 
GWENOVIER I would just want to clear some things up: 
FRANK (Muffy delivers coffee) Thank you, Muffy.  Funny thing is: This is an important element of, "Seduce and Destory:" "Facing the past is an important way in not making progress," that's something I tell my men over and over -- 
GWENOVIER This isn't meant -- 
FRANK -- and I try and teach the students to ask: What is it in aid of? 
GWENOVIER Are you asking me that? 
FRANK Yes. 
GWENOVIER Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become -- 
FRANK In aid of what? 
GWENOVIER I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are -- 
FRANK -- there's a lot more important things I'd like to put myself into -- 
GWENOVIER It's all important -- 
FRANK Not really. 
GWENOVIER It's not like I'm trying to attack you -- 
FRANK This is how you wanna spend the time, then go, go, go -- you're gonna be surprised at what a waste it is -- "The most useless thing in the world is that which is behind me," Chapter Three -- 
GWENOVIER We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand -- 
FRANK I'm not sure I hear a question in there? 
GWENOVIER Do you remember a Miss Simms? 
FRANK I know alotta women and I'm sure she remembers me. 
GWENOVIER She does.  From when you were a boy. 
FRANK Mm. Hm. 
GWENOVIER She lived in Tarzana. 
FRANK An old stomping ground --is this the "attack" portion of the interview, I figured this was coming sooner or later -- Is "the girl" coming in for the kill? 
GWENOVIER No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question -- 
FRANK Go ahead and waste your time. 
GWENOVIER I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young -- 
FRANK And that's what you've heard? 
GWENOVIER I talked to Miss Simms.  Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980. 
BEAT. Frank goes silent. 
GWENOVIER In my research I have you listed as the only son of Earl and Lily Partridge. (beat) And what I learned from Mrs. Simms is that your mother passed away in 1980. (beat) See:  It's my understanding that the information supplied by you and your company and answers to question's I've asked are incorrect, Frank. And if I'd like to get to the bottom of who you are and why you are then I think your family history -- you're accurate family history...well: this seems important...Frank...? 
VIDEO CAMERA POV - THAT MOMENT Frank lights his cigarette.  CAMERA zooms into CU.

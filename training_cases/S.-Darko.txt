Second draft 
EXT. WHEAT FIELD - MORNING 
SAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly, looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless wheat field. 
Sam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful... 
She smiles, and starts walking. 
EXT. ARKANSAS HIGHWAY 40 - MORNING 
She emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in Arkansas. Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the deserted lanes, is a TRUCK STOP. 
EXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING 
Amongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot is a white, late-80s model CHEVROLET CELEBRITY. Sam makes her way across the asphalt toward the vehicle... 
INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - MORNING 
COREY RICHARDSON (18) is asleep, curled up in the reclined driver's seat of the car. She awakens when Sam gets in on the passenger side and slams the door shut. 
Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair, piercings, a little grungy. She rubs the sleep from her eyes, greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one. 
COREY What time is it? 
SAM Early... 
Corey adjusts her seat. She takes a long drag and chokes, then spits out the window. She starts the car... 
I/E. COREY'S CHEVROLET/HIGHWAY 40, VARIOUS - DAY 
Corey's car cruises along the flat, open road. She cranks up the VOLUME on the car's CASSETTE DECK, nodding her head to early-90s ALT. ROCK (suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)... 
Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery: FARMERS at work in the fields; a BILLBOARD advertising a local restaurant; ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash... 
She fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane. It contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and three SIBLINGS, one of them being a YOUNGSTER. The Youngster makes a face at Sam as they pass by... 
INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - LATER - DAY 
Corey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine start to RATTLE. She sees that the TEMPERATURE GAUGE has hit the red and her CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is on. 
COREY Shit... 
EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/COREY'S CHEVROLET - DAY 
By the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway, steam billows out from under the hood. Sam gets out of the car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel. 
Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the steam. It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the inside of the engine with a hammer. 
SAM Turn it off. 
COREY (poking her head out the WINDOW) What? 
SAM Turn off the car. 
Corey does so. 
SAM (CONT'D) Doesn't look too good... 
COREY How do you know? 
SAM It smells funny. 
Sam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward them. Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down... 
The pick-up pulls over ahead of them. CHRIS HOLT (24), a brawny, attractive young man, gets out. When Corey sees him she gets out too. 
SAM (CONT'D) Thanks for stopping. Our car's messed up. 
CHRIS What happened? 
COREY My check engine light came on, then it just started smoking, and ticking and shit. 
As Chris pokes around under the hood, Sam and Corey exchange looks. Chris pops opens the COOLANT CAP and burns his hand on the steam explosion. 
CHRIS (shaking it off) Blew your water pump. Can't drive it. 
COREY Fuck me... 
COREY Corey. 
SAM I'm Samantha. 
They shake, and Corey seems at ease mingling with the strangers. Sam hangs back a little. 
COREY One of you guys mind pickin' us up a bottle of something? 
RANDY I think I can manage that. What do you want? 
COREY I don't know. Vodka, whiskey, whatever. 
Corey looks to Sam, who produces some cash. Randy takes the money and heads for the store. 
RANDY Be right back... 
After he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously. Ruth stares at them in a different way. She seems somewhat resentful of their presence. 
RUTH From Virginia, huh? 
COREY Yep. 
RUTH I saw your plates... 
Corey and Sam both nod in mundane acknowledgment. Another beat of uncomfortable silence. 
RUTH (CONT'D) Where to? 
COREY What? 
RUTH Your obviously just passin' through here. 
SAM We're on the way to Vegas. 
Ruth snickers. 
RUTH Well... you need anything besides booze, you just lemme know. 
Randy comes out of the store with a bottle in a brown bag. He passes it off to Corey, along with some change. 
COREY Thanks a lot, man. 
RANDY No problem. You guys wanna come back to my place for bit? Bring your bottle, we got some weed... 
Corey looks like she's considering it, but -- 
SAM I'm really tired. 
She takes Sam's signal. 
COREY Yeah, I think we'll just head back. Been a long day, ya know? 
RANDY That's cool. 
EXT. BANK - LATER - NIGHT 
The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to -- JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29 MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS... 
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT 
Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed. 
TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. There's a digital CLOCK/RADIO that reads 3:30 AM. 
The TV is on, and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE FOREMAN GRILL plays. Sam stares at the screen as the images WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly loud, rumbling TREMOR from outside... 
In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the television. She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND, about to touch it... A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO: 
EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHT 
Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from the building. She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS, and her RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE. 
There's a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple, with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded under the skin and protruding from the wound. 
She is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and fluid. A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance... 
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELD 
A glimpse of the field through Sam's eyes shows a phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions, and move according to a framework of set paths. 
A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic life-gel to its burrow... COSMIC ENERGY burns around a CLUSTER OF STONES... Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sam's field of vision... 
It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL. 
EXT. WINDMILL - NIGHT 
FRANK That whack job Tom's been squattin' up there the last couple a' months. Thinks he's the goddamn town watchman... (BEAT) You think he got blown up? 
Everyone scans the ground for signs of human remains until Phil pipes up: 
PHIL I saw him out in front of the motel early this morning, alive and well. 
FRANK (SARCASTIC) Oh, well, thank heavens... 
Sam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK. It's marred by BURN MARKS and DENTS from the explosion. As she tilts her head and looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin... 
...in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT MONSTER BUNNY. 
EXT. MOTEL - MORNING 
Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when they turn and see that Chris has followed them. 
CHRIS Hey... 
SAM Hey. 
CHRIS So you guys stayed here last night? 
COREY One of us did. 
Sam gives Corey a look. Chris decides to ignore the comment. 
CHRIS What's up with your car? 
COREY It's gonna take a couple days. 
CHRIS For a water pump? 
Sam and Corey shrug. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) None of my business, but... 
He's distracted when a brand new `95 BMW pulls up and parks nearby. JEREMY FRAME (25), a thin, pale young man hops out and hustles into the field toward the crash site. 
SAM What? 
Chris regains his train of thought: 
CHRIS I was just gonna say, if you wanted, I could give you a ride back. 
He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over at Corey, as if just remembering she was there. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) You too. I mean, I could give you both a ride. 
COREY To Middlesex, Virginia? Do you have any clue how far that is? 
CHRIS (SHEEPISH) I got some time... 
Sam looks as though she's about to say something but Corey overpowers her. 
COREY We're not goin' back. Even El Reno's better than there. 
Chris makes eye contact with Sam again. She maintains it for a moment and then looks away. 
EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY 
Vietnam Tom explores a cluttered junkyard, gathering materials. He scours amongst the PILES OF REFUSE, RUSTY MACHINES and crumbling STORAGE SHACKS. 
He bends to pick up a SCRAP OF METAL and adds it to a collection he's making in a worn SATCHEL... 
EXT. DINER - DAY 
As Sam and Corey are about to enter the diner, Trudy Potter, a bank teller, is on her way out. 
The girls move to the side so she can exit, and take notice of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY MOORCROFT'S (10) dark, empty eyes stare at them from the BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH. 
TRUDY (O.S.) Isn't that just awful? 
Trudy has stopped and is looking over their shoulders. 
TRUDY (CONT'D) His poor mother... 
INT. DINER - DAY 
The girls sit at a booth, sipping Cokes. 
COREY How much money do we have left? 
SAM Not a whole lot. 
COREY I can't believe your fucking parents wouldn't give you anything. 
EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON 
Vietnam Tom crouches in a decrepit SHACK covered by a piece of CORRUGATED ROOFING. He works with great focus, arranging VARIOUS BITS OF METAL into some sort of small SCULPTURE... 
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON 
Having finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor store on the way back to the motel. They find Randy, Ruth, Jeff and Mike at their usual post. 
RANDY Hey, what's up? 
COREY Not much... just getting stared down by creepy priest boy back there. 
JEFF Father Homeijer? 
MIKE Don't worry, you're a little old for his taste. 
JEFF Yeah, he's a fuckin' perv. 
COREY (to Randy) You got an extra cigarette? 
Randy takes a pack from his pocket and offers her one. 
RANDY I'm throwin' a big party at my house tonight, you guys should come by. No excuses this time... 
Sam and Corey look at each other, considering. 
RANDY (CONT'D) You're gonna be stuck in El Reno, you might as well have some fun, right? 
EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT 
The party at Randy's teems with LOCALS, ages ranging from early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL, and a few people swim in the greenish water. 
Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer. 
COREY You guys gotta come visit the club when we get all set up. We'll give you the VIP treatment, man... 
Mike and Jeff are both excited about this proposition. 
MIKE Sounds good to me. 
COREY Give us a little time, me and Sam'll be runnin' that place, no doubt... right? 
SAM Yeah. Definitely. 
Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her cup for some liquid courage. 
Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth notices him first. 
RUTH Fuck. 
RANDY What? 
RUTH That pig, O'Dell. 
RANDY Don't worry about Ryan. He might be a cop, but he still likes to party. 
Randy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE GIRLS... But Ruth is still not satisfied. 
RUTH I think that asshole knows I deal. You know how fucked that is? 
RANDY From what I hear he's got a little somethin' goin' on the side himself. 
RUTH Fucking pig's a pig. 
They're all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into the pool and splashes them. 
MIKE                               JEFF Fuck!                            Bastard! 
SAM What the hell... 
Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. Ruth watches her, smirking. 
RANDY We might as well all go in now, we're already wet. 
RUTH Good idea... 
Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool -- 
ANGLE: BENEATH THE WATER 
She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION. All SOUNDS are DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached. 
Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS glimmering beyond the surface of the water... TRANSITION TO: 
INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Sam, wait... hey, come on... 
EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
Sam finds a STOOP at the side of the house where she can be alone. She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard, but no one else is in sight. 
Still soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts to pound the rest of her drink... 
A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF RANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an orange glow. 
She is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her forehead... 
A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away. 
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS 
Two DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex, phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON, and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE. 
DRUNK GUY #1 Hurry up... 
Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam whatsoever. ANOTHER CAR speeds by, again nearly crushing her, but she doesn't flinch... 
She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a DITCH near a CULVERT -- 
ANGLE: CULVERT 
Sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch. Tom stares at her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask. 
From one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight through to the other side... 
A PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong enough to make them falter. 
On the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of FATHER HOMEIJER'S CHURCH -- 
EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
Tom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over them. Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS and approach the great WOOD DOORS... 
INT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS. Tom strides past her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT... 
Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall. 
Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right, where two walls and the ceiling meet... 
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT 
The three planes come together at an irregular angle, with the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILING SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD. 
PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines, with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture. 
A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he stands below it, reaching higher and higher... 
As Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity -- 
ANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLS 
Sam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and outer walls. Claustrophobic, dusty and obscure. 
Dilapidated WIRING snakes around them, and Tom barely has enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger... 
COSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE. A SPARK. A BLUE FLAME... 
Heat and pressure build. The old dry wood begins to CREAK and SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE. 
OVER WHITE... 
The SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away... then become present again. Louder now, and different. A BANGING... 
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - THE NEXT DAY 
Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face. She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the beds. 
She's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing... 
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! 
She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR... 
I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
JEREMY (CONT'D) So what are you up to? 
SAM Trying to get money... not very successfully. 
JEREMY I've gotta pick up some cash too. Need some supplies for the lab. I don't think I've even slept since I got my hands on that meteorite. You should come by the lab with me and check it out. 
SAM I can't... 
Sam starts to walk away from him. 
JEREMY I could let you borrow some money... if you need some. 
SAM I don't even know you. 
JEREMY That's okay. I trust you. 
SAM Thanks anyway. 
JEREMY You're sure you don't want to check out the lab? 
SAM Sorry... I've gotta find Corey. 
Sam turns to leave. 
JEREMY Maybe some other time. 
I/E. RANDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON 
Corey rides shotgun in Randy's car, chewing on some greasy FAST FOOD, looking quite content. Randy is behind the wheel with a BEER in his hand, and Mike, Jeff and Ruth are packed into the back, passing around a JOINT. 
MIKE How many cheeseburgers did we get? 
RUTH Like eight. 
Mike passes the joint up to Corey and she takes a big hit, chases it with some beer... 
JEFF Wait, did we get smokes? 
Everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when they turn a corner and see what's left of the church. 
MIKE                            RANDY Whoa!                           Jesus Christ... 
POV FROM THE CAR - THE CHURCH RUINS 
POLICE and FIREMEN swarm. Father Homeijer stands with Officer O'Dell, gazing at the soggy ruins. The only things standing amid the charred mess are the THREE BARE CROSSES of Mount Calvary. But they aren't completely intact -- 
EXT. CHURCH RUINS - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - DEFORMED CROSSES 
All three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward the murky ground... 
OFFICER O'DELL (O.S.) Musta' melted from the heat. 
Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside himself with bitterness and sorrow. 
FATHER HOMEIJER They're made of silver-plated steel. A simple fire couldn't do that. 
OFFICER O'DELL What are you sayin'? 
FATHER HOMEIJER This is an extension of Satan's own hand... I've seen it coming. 
Rolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to grieve for his church in private. 
EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON 
Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but progress has been made... 
It has begun to take on a recognizable form: a GROTESQUE COUNTENANCE with TWO LONG EARS, BULGING EYES and a devilish, TOOTHY GRIN... 
EXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON 
Sam is walking in front of a DEPARTMENT STORE when Randy's car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the passenger side window. 
COREY What happened to you? 
SAM What happened to me...? Where the hell've you been? 
COREY I crashed at Randy's. We just got food. Want a burger? 
SAM My stomach's fucked up. 
JEFF                             MIKE Awww...                         Poor tummy... 
Jeff and Mike taunt her from the back. Ruth leers. 
SAM (CONT'D) We gotta talk about what we're gonna do. 
INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON 
Corey signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, the expression of shock still glued to her face. O'Dell sits facing her. 
OFFICER O'DELL You're sure you didn't see a driver? 
COREY No... 
He takes the statement from her. 
OFFICER O'DELL Well, you're one lucky girl to have gotten outta the car when you did. Front passenger side was wiped right out. Coulda' been two dead girls today instead of one. 
Corey nods, taking this in. 
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) I talked to Randy and sent him home a little while ago. He's pretty shook up. 
Corey doesn't respond. O'Dell leans in to speak to her in confidence. 
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Both of us know he'd been doin' some drinkin' today. But we also know he's not at fault here. That old beater cut right in front him. 
COREY Can't you just look up the license plates? 
OFFICER O'DELL No plates on the vehicle. We're investigating the VIN, but that could take a little more time, depending on the history of ownership. We'll find him. 
Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject: 
COREY What about the missing boy? 
O'Dell shifts in his chair. 
OFFICER O'DELL You really think it was him, huh? 
COREY He was on the side of the road right before the accident. 
OFFICER O'DELL I'm no psychiatrist, but I do know sometimes shock does funny things... 
COREY You think I was hallucinating? 
OFFICER O'DELL We were on the scene five minutes after the accident. I think somebody woulda noticed a little boy wandering around. 
He sees how troubled Corey is. 
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Why don't you stop in and see Dr. Peters on your way out... right down the hall there. She'll give you somethin' to make you feel better. 
Corey nods and gets up to leave. As she's on her way out, O'Dell's voice stops her. 
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Oh, uh... is there anything you wanted to say to Samantha's parents? 
Corey's expression is blank. 
COREY Like what? 
EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON 
Corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti- depressants. 
She is frightened when she notices a PAIR OF EYES staring at her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle. 
Corey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her... She's about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the police station behind her. 
CHRIS Get the hell outta here. 
Grateful for his presence, Corey moves to stand behind Chris. Tom shuffles away. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) Should know better than to be carrying his rifle around town like that... 
Corey takes a breath, recovering from her scare. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) You okay? 
COREY What're you doing here? 
CHRIS I had to put in a statement too. Can I give you a lift? 
I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - EVENING 
Chris and Corey pull up to the motel in his pick-up. They've gotten Corey's prescription filled, and she has the BOTTLE OF PILLS in her hand. 
CHRIS I'm real sorry about Sam. 
Corey nods. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) It's such a waste. Just a horrible, freak thing. 
COREY I said some pretty shitty things to her right before it happened. 
COREY I don't have that much either. 
Dusty is perturbed. 
DUSTY You think I do this for charity? 
CHRIS You didn't do anything. What's she want a water pump for if she doesn't have an engine? 
DUSTY I see how it is... couple a' punks. You don't plan to pay what you owe, you can get the hell off my property right now. 
Corey glares at him, furious, but Chris takes her by the arm. 
COREY (under her breath) Asshole. 
CHRIS Let's go... 
I/E. CHRIS' TRUCK/MOTEL - AFTERNOON 
Chris' truck pulls up in front of the motel and parks. At the same time, Father Homeijer and Trudy come out of the FRONT OFFICE carrying a COLLECTIONS JAR. 
As they approach the truck Chris slowly rolls down the window. 
FATHER HOMEIJER Good afternoon. 
TRUDY We're taking collections to help rebuild Mount Calvary after the tragic fire. 
FATHER HOMEIJER Any small amount you could manage would really help. 
CHRIS Sorry. 
Father Homeijer and Trudy look over to Corey in the passenger seat but she just stares back at them. 
FATHER HOMEIJER God bless you. 
They turn and walk away, and Chris rolls his window back up. 
CHRIS Everybody wants somethin'... 
COREY What about you? 
CHRIS What do you mean? 
COREY You wouldn't give me stuff and drive me around if you didn't want something in return. 
CHRIS Why not? 
COREY `Cause that's just not how it works. 
CHRIS Maybe you're wrong about that. 
Corey nods, but still doesn't believe him. 
COREY See ya. 
She gets out, and Chris eyes her as she walks to her room. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT 
Corey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in The Philosophy of Time Travel book. The TELEVISION is on in the b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILL INFOMERCIAL... 
Suddenly, there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE runs over the TV screen. 
Corey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMAN'S VOICE, HULK HOGAN is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL... 
Just then, there is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up to answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught. 
RANDY Do you hate me? 
COREY Huh? 
RANDY You think it's my fault she's dead. 
COREY No... 
RANDY You mean it? 
COREY Yeah... it wasn't your fault. 
Randy sighs as if a big weight has been lifted. 
RANDY What's that? 
Corey looks down and realizes that she's still holding The Philosophy of Time Travel book in her hand. 
COREY Oh, it's just... something of Sam's. 
Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a small gathering to celebrate his return. STREAMERS hang over a table supporting a partially eaten CAKE. A BANNER that reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN. 
BILLY'S MOTHER (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair, is an older female version of Billy himself. 
As she brings a POT OF COFFEE and a STACK OF CUPS into BILLY'S FATHER (35), BILLY'S AUNT and UNCLE, and a CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST who is moderating (50s; male) in the den, she looks as though she's barely keeping it together. 
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (between bites of cake) The place for Billy to be right now is at home with his family... 
Billy's Mother interrupts as she sets the coffee down. 
BILLY'S MOTHER Excuse me. 
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST Oh, thank you. 
The Psychologist accepts a cup. 
CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST (CONT'D) It'll take years for him to work through what happened, but the best way to open those doors is to surround him with things that are familiar... 
Billy's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a long, painful moment of eye contact. 
INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Billy sits at a table in the sunny, HEXAGONAL ROOM. He wears the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. 
He appears clean and groomed, but his face and neck are marred by BRUISES and other ABRASIONS. Before him is a packet of COLORED PENCILS and some sheets of PAPER. 
His Mother walks up behind him, and peeks over his shoulder at the DRAWING that he's working on. 
BILLY'S MOTHER Are you sure you don't want some more cake? 
Billy nods. His mother caresses his head as she watches him color. After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and tries to get his attention. 
BILLY'S MOTHER (CONT'D) Billy... I- 
Before she can go on, she's interrupted by the DOORBELL. Billy never looks up. 
I/E. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY 
Billy's Father answers the door and finds Corey. 
BILLY'S FATHER Only family and close friends are welcome here today. 
Billy's Mother hovers behind her husband, curious about and wary of the stranger. 
COREY I understand... I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about everything that happened to Billy. And I know it doesn't seem like it, but everything happens for a reason... and it'll all work out in the end. 
Billy's Father stares her down until she turns to leave uncomfortably. Billy's Mother starts to cry... CUT BACK TO: 
INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY 
...the breakfast nook. Billy is gone. 
Left on the table is his completed DRAWING. It's a neatly executed rendition of a SWING SET -- identical to the one from Corey's vision in the closet door mirror. 
EXT. PARK - DAY 
Billy walks through the empty park, still wearing his birthday hat. He makes his way past a SAND PIT with a JUNGLE GYM. 
Balanced on one of the jungle gym's bars is a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE... 
Billy picks it up. The name on the prescription is COREY RICHARDSON. JUMP CUT TO: 
The SWING SET. Billy leans back as far as he can as momentum propels his body forward and back through space. He looks up to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming... 
He swings back and forth... back and forth... 
ANGLE: PARK BENCH 
Corey sits nearby on a park bench, watching Billy. He looks back at her, showing no signs of recognition... JUMP CUT TO: 
The SWING. No longer a little boy sitting in it. It dangles erratically from the ropes, still gripped by inertia... 
PAN DOWN to the sandy ground below -- FIND the bottle of pills, now empty. Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND... 
EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/EL RENO EXIT - AFTERNOON 
A TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK gets off the highway and heads into El Reno. It's load is a batch of beat up, OLD CARS. 
The JALOPY is on the TOP RACK, CLOSEST TO THE END... 
EXT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - AFTERNOON 
Randy peeks in the window of Corey's motel room but sees nothing. He pounds on the door and calls for her: 
RANDY Corey... 
JEREMY Sam? Are you okay? What are doing? 
SAM I'm... yeah, I'm okay. 
Jeremy gets out of the car and puts his hand on her shoulder. 
JEREMY You shouldn't be out here like this. C'mon, get in. 
She allows herself to be led to the passenger side... 
INT. JEREMY'S BMW - MORNING 
Sam leans her head back against the headrest as Jeremy drives. 
JEREMY You do that a lot? 
SAM I think it's genetic or something. 
JEREMY That's interesting... I've never heard of a specific genetic marker for sleepwalking. 
SAM It's just that my brother used to do it too. 
JEREMY He doesn't anymore? 
SAM No. 
JEREMY I think it's more common in children. When did your brother stop? 
SAM When he died. 
EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING 
Some WORKERS are in the process of   rebuilding the WINDMILL. A MAN WITH A HOSE sprays the side of   the WATER TANK in an attempt to wash off the burn marks   resembling the nearly imperceptible image of the MONSTER   BUNNY'S FACE... 
I/E. JEREMY'S BMW/MOTEL - MORNING 
Jeremy pulls into the motel parking lot. Sam hesitates for a moment before getting out. 
JEREMY I heard about your friend... 
Sam doesn't say anything, so he goes on. 
JEREMY (CONT'D) I wasn't gonna say anything... but then I thought I probably should, because if I didn't, it might be inconsiderate. 
SAM Well... okay. Thanks. 
A beat. 
JEREMY So... what are you gonna do? 
SAM I don't know yet. 
Sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face, still not wanting to go inside the motel room. 
SAM (CONT'D) Do you believe that everything happens for a reason? 
JEREMY I know that for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction. 
SAM Yeah... I learned that in science. 
JEREMY And everything in the universe is in constant motion, as the universe is constantly expanding... 
SAM Yeah, but do you believe that everything happens for a reason, like in life? 
JEREMY You mean like destiny? 
Jeremy thinks on this for a moment. 
JEREMY (CONT'D) I think everyone has a purpose. Something they're meant to do. Like potential, but more clear-cut. For instance, I was destined to get my hands on the meteorite. 
SAM Really. 
JEREMY I'm making amazing discoveries every day, practically sleeping at the lab... 
While he talks and becomes more excited he scratches nervously at his left forearm. It draws Sam's attention away from what he's saying. 
JEREMY (CONT'D) I'm still doing some tests, but there's a metallic substance that's not showing up on the elemental CHARTS- 
SAM What happened to your arm? 
Jeremy stops scratching. A small area on the inner part of his wrist is RAW and RED, partially SCABBED OVER. 
JEREMY It's just a rash. 
Sam starts to get out of the car. 
Tom shakes his head no. 
SAM (CONT'D) I wish it was me. 
She looks at Tom. 
SAM (CONT'D) I really want... to die. 
Tom aims his gun at her face... 
He realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them, because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier bends and becomes slightly opaque. 
Sam is expressionless. Tom's finger trembles as he places it on the trigger. 
He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE, and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRAL QUADRANT... 
Tom pulls the trigger. TIME SLOWS DOWN. 
A liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel. Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it... 
The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to accommodate the penetrating force... 
The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same spot, centimeters from her face -- 
SAM (CONT'D) (DISAPPOINTED) Not today. 
I/E. MOTEL ROOM 15 - DAY 
A HAND bangs on the door to room 15... 
After a beat, Sam opens it. She's got some makeup on, and has spent more time on her hair than usual. 
SAM (SURPRISED) Hi. 
Chris lingers in front of the door, looking slightly uncomfortable. 
CHRIS I just stopped by to see how you were holdin' up. 
SAM I'm okay. 
CHRIS Sorry about the other night... I DIDN'T- 
SAM I was just upset. I shouldn't have snapped at you like that. 
Chris nods, grateful for her forgiveness. 
CHRIS So what are you still doin' here? I figured you woulda hopped on a bus by now. 
SAM I'm gonna be taking off soon, I think. I just gotta figure some stuff out. It's quiet here. 
CHRIS I don't know if you're doin' anything later on, but... 
He trails off when he HEARS a CAR pull up and park by his truck. He turns and sees that it's Jeremy in his BMW. 
SAM I was just on my way out. What were you gonna say? 
CHRIS Nothin'. 
SAM Okay, well... I'll see you later? 
CHRIS Yeah, sure. 
He steps out of the way so Sam can shut and lock the door. 
SAM Bye. 
CHRIS Bye. 
Chris stares down Jeremy as Sam gets into his car and they drive off together. 
INT. LAB - DAY 
Jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab. There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISION ROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT. 
As he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain his excitement. Sam follows, taking note of a LARGE RABBIT in an extremely SMALL CAGE... 
JEREMY Here's my station. 
He unlocks a drawer in the lower portion of the desk and retrieves a BOX containing a tiny SLICE OF ROCK with a grid- like PATTERN OF METALLIC CRYSTALS embedded in it. 
SAM That's it? 
JEREMY The rest is locked away somewhere else... somewhere safe. Everyone's gonna want a piece of this thing pretty soon. 
He takes it over to an SCANNING ELECTRON MICROSCOPE and turns it on. He places the meteorite slice in the microscope's VACUUM COLUMN through an AIRTIGHT DOOR. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON 
Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department store... 
He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke break. 
EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON 
The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK carrying the JALOPY breaches the crest of the hill, descending on the intersection... 
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS 
Chris lights up a cigarette... 
CHRIS' POV - TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK 
He watches as the TRACTOR-TRAILER hits the pothole, but passes safely through the intersection, making a right. 
Something about the sight of this strikes Chris so much that his cigarette falls out of his mouth. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY 
Father Homeijer and Trudy stroll down a quiet street with their COLLECTIONS JAR, and arrive at a fork in the road. 
FATHER HOMEIJER You take this street, I'll take that one? 
Without warning, Trudy kisses him on the cheek. 
TRUDY Good luck. 
Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a friendly manner. They move off in separate directions... 
EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAY 
Father Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house. No answer. 
INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
The priest lets himself into the garage, which is open but deserted. He notices COREY'S CHEVROLET. He steps up to the GARAGE ENTRANCE and knocks... 
No one comes to the door, but he notices that it's slightly ajar. 
FATHER HOMEIJER Dusty? 
He can hear COUNTRY MUSIC playing low within. 
FATHER HOMEIJER (CONT'D) Are you home, son? 
He lets himself inside... 
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
Father Homeijer walks into the dingy kitchen. The SINK is full of DIRTY DISHES. A coating of GRIME over everything. 
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, LIVING - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - PIT BULL 
The sleeping PIT BULL stirs... 
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
The priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO that sits on the kitchen counter. 
FATHER HOMEIJER (calling out) Dusty? I'd like to trouble you for a small donation... 
The COUNTRY SONG comes to a close, and the tape runs out. With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound -- soft, distant CRYING. 
He looks curiously toward the CELLAR DOOR... [Note: The CRYING SOUND should be identical to the one that drew Corey out of the motel room.] 
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, BASEMENT - DAY 
Father Homeijer slowly descends the rickety BASEMENT STEPS. At the bottom, he finds a STRING that connects to a bare overhead BULB... 
He creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old WASHER/DRYER, continuing toward the source of the CRYING, which has become more pronounced. He wrinkles his nose at a foul smell... 
FATHER HOMEIJER Who's there? 
He rounds a corner, and when he sees Billy Moorcroft he's nearly frozen in shock -- 
The boy is locked inside a large, METAL DOG'S CAGE. He sits on the floor of the cage, rocking back and forth. 
He is pale, bruised and slick with sweat, clothed only in a pair of SOILED BRIEFS. Beside him is an aluminum WATER BOWL and some scraps of WHITE BREAD. The floor beneath him is soaked with URINE and scattered FECES. 
Father Homeijer makes the sign of the cross. 
EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAY 
CHRIS (CONT'D) If I had kids, I'd be worried sick about `em in a world like this. I'm sure your parents must be. 
SAM Hey, you could've been some crazy rapist serial killer. 
Agatha is there with his coffee just in time to hear this last part. She gives Chris and Sam each an odd look before setting the coffee down and leaving. 
SAM (CONT'D) You turned out okay. 
CHRIS Yeah, but everybody doesn't. 
SAM I can take care of myself. 
CHRIS I'm sure you can... but I wouldn't feel right if I didn't tell you about Jeremy. 
SAM What about him? 
CHRIS I don't know what you have goin' with him... but you shouldn't be hangin' around him. Let's just leave it at that. 
SAM What makes you think you can tell me who I can and can't hang around with? 
CHRIS It's just that I know him better than you do. He lived in my neighborhood when we were kids. 
SAM So? 
CHRIS So he used to do weird stuff... to animals. 
Sam waits for him to go on. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) My sister lost her pet rabbit once, and we went all over the neighborhood lookin' for it. We were just about to call it quits when we heard something comin' from Jeremy's garage. He'd stuck it in a trash can and put the lid on. 
Sam looks shocked and a little disgusted. 
CHRIS (CONT'D) It was half starved by the time we got it home. Died just a few days later. 
SAM How old was he? 
CHRIS I don't know, just a couple years. Cute little black and white- 
SAM No. Jeremy. 
CHRIS He was like nine, probably. 
SAM He was just a kid, he didn't know what he was doing. 
CHRIS When you were nine years old did you know it was wrong to put a living creature in the trash can and leave it there? 
Sam's had enough. 
SAM Chris... you're a nice guy, but you don't have to be looking out for me. You're not my dad, you're not my big brother... 
Chris hangs his head, frustrated. 
INT. JAIL CELL - AFTERNOON 
O'Dell stands at the bars of Dusty's jail cell. Dusty lies on his cot and stares up at the ceiling. 
OFFICER O'DELL You know what they do to faggot-ass perverts like you in maximum security, dontcha? 
O'Dell chuckles, enjoying this immensely. 
OFFICER O'DELL (CONT'D) Disgusting fuckin' piece a' shit like you... 
EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - EVENING 
O'Dell, now dressed in plainclothes, is on the way to his CAR in the far corner of the back lot. He HEARS someone come out the door behind him, but doesn't turn until he HEARS his VOICE. 
OFFICER HINES Hey, O'Dell... 
OFFICER O'DELL I'm on my way out... what do you need? 
Hines catches up with him and they walk and talk. 
OFFICER HINES I'm not gonna bullshit ya. 
OFFICER O'DELL Okay... 
OFFICER HINES I saw you snatch the drugs outta that house. 
O'Dell's face grows cold but he doesn't slow his pace. 
OFFICER O'DELL I don't think I know what the hell you're talkin' about. 
OFFICER HINES Don't bullshit me either... 
Hines grabs his shoulder to stop him. O'Dell eyes his hand. 
When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand. 
SAM Do you like to read? 
Tom says nothing. 
SAM (CONT'D) You can borrow it... 
Again, Tom does not speak. After a beat, Sam gets up slowly and walks away, leaving Tom with the book. 
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY 
Jeremy is at the department store in the FIRST AID SECTION, picking out some GAUZE and DISINFECTANT. When he looks down the aisle and sees Sam, he moves toward her quickly... 
He disturbs her while she's looking at some FEMININE HYGIENE PRODUCTS. 
JEREMY Sam... 
When he sees the items that she's shopping for, he seems much more embarrassed than she does. 
SAM Oh, hi Jeremy. 
JEREMY Hi... sorry. 
SAM That's okay, what's up? 
JEREMY Nothing... just that I haven't see you around for the past few days. I was worried. I thought you might've taken off. 
SAM No... I've been around. Going for lots of walks. 
JEREMY I stopped by the motel. 
Sam finds his manner a bit odd. 
SAM Like I said, I've been in and out. 
JEREMY Well, there's something I wanted to ask you. You know that book you mentioned? 
SAM Yeah... 
JEREMY I'd really love to check it out. 
SAM Oh... 
Sam's face darkens, and Jeremy picks up on it. 
JEREMY You said you'd show it to me sometime, and I've got a hunch it could really help me in some of my studies related to- 
SAM I don't have it anymore. 
JEREMY What? 
SAM I kind of... gave it to someone. 
JEREMY To who? Why? 
SAM I'm sorry. I just... forgot that I said you could borrow it, and this GUY- 
JEREMY What guy? 
SAM Well... that Vietnam Tom guy. 
Jeremy is furious. 
JEREMY Vietnam Tom!? You gave away the book to Vietnam Tom!? 
Sam backs away from him. He's getting louder and out of control. 
JEREMY (CONT'D) I don't fucking believe what you're telling me! 
SAM It's just a book... 
JEREMY He's a fucking bum! And you chose him over me!? 
SAM No... I just- 
Suddenly, a hand comes down on Jeremy's shoulder. He turns and finds Chris standing behind him. 
CHRIS That's enough. 
Sam is relieved. Jeremy glares at Chris. 
JEREMY This is none of your business. 
CHRIS It is, actually. You're disturbing my customers. Get out. 
Officer Hines walks to the edge of the woods beside the warehouse and unzips his pants... 
ANGLE: O'DELL'S CAR 
With GLOVED HANDS, O'Dell grabs VIETNAM TOM'S RIFLE out of the trunk... 
INT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON 
Trudy's head is buried in her hands and she bawls. 
TRUDY I feel like such an idiot... 
Father Homeijer doesn't know what to say. 
EXT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
Hines finishes relieving himself and comes out into the open from the side of the building. O'Dell is waiting for him. 
OFFICER HINES What the fuck- 
BOOM! 
O'Dell shoots him in the chest. He is cool and calm. He throws the rifle down on the ground... 
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT 
The SHOPPING CARTS whirl in an circle of ever-increasing speed around Vietnam Tom and Sam. The RUBBER WHEELS squeal on the cement until they start to melt... 
The VECTOR SPEARS lead the carts in a spiral that hones in closer and closer to the two of them. Sam is stoic. Tom is in awe... 
EXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT - POV INSIDE PORTAL 
We travel at breath-taking speed through a PORTAL as it weaves through millions of STARS, then an ATMOSPHERIC BARRIER... 
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LATE NIGHT 
When it looks like they'll be crushed by the scudding metal, or combusted by the cosmic energy, the WORM-LIKE PORTAL from the sky reaches down and encloses Tom and Sam like a vacuum. 
There's a brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT -- TRANSITION TO: 
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - THE NEXT MORNING 
CHRIS' TRUCK pulls into the lot early in the morning, and he gets out wearing his work uniform. Still groggy, he's about to walk into the store when something catches his eye... 
CRANE UP to FIND a STRUCTURE made of all the SHOPPING CARTS, as chilling and impressive as a crop circle, in the shape of an immense FIBONACCI SPIRAL. The metal of the carts has been fused together, and they're stacked in an ascending manner that reaches an apex in the center, like a cone. 
Chris is mystified... CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Two POLICE CRUISERS speed down a street in town... 
EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON 
COPS, including Officer O'Dell, converge on Vietnam Tom in the park, where he sits on the SWING in his ski mask... 
COP #1 Get down on the ground! 
Tom looks up at them calmly, without fear. 
COP #1 (CONT'D) Get down on the ground, now! 
He obeys them and two Cops jump on him and put him in cuffs. One of them pulls up his head and rips off his ski mask -- 
Tom's face is a mass of SCARS. Both his cheeks, forehead and chin are marred by scar tissue born from long, deep gashes. 
O'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes... 
INT. POLICE STATION, VARIOUS - AFTERNOON 
Tom is slammed against a table. An OFFICER takes his hand roughly and sticks his fingers into some ink to take his prints -- JUMP CUT TO: 
POLICEMAN (V.O.) Name? 
Tom stands for his booking photos -- JUMP CUT TO: 
POLICEMAN (CONT'D) (getting angry) What's your name? 
The POLICEMAN stands over Vietnam Tom, who sits defeated in a chair. A YOUNG OFFICER approaches. 
YOUNG OFFICER We found this on him... 
He passes the Policeman a set of DOG TAGS on a CHAIN. The name on the tags is: THOMAS WARD SPARROW. 
EXT. MOTEL - EVENING 
A SPARKLING GREEN BALL shoots out of the stick into the air. Sam looks up at it and smiles. Jeremy shoots off colorful ball after ball, aiming in different directions. 
SAM They're pretty. 
After his stick fizzles out: 
JEREMY You wanna try one? 
Sam shrugs... He grabs another out of the grocery bag, and Sam gets up slowly. He passes her the ROMAN CANDLE, and she accepts it with her RIGHT HAND... 
JEREMY (CONT'D) Just hold it straight up. 
Sam holds it and Jeremy flicks his LIGHTER. The WICK catches... 
JEREMY (CONT'D) It's goin'! 
Sam smiles and holds the stick as far away from her face as possible. She closes her eyes... 
But the wick burns down extremely fast. The FIRST BALL gets stuck at the top and implodes, causing the whole thing to catch fire. 
SAM Ow! 
JEREMY Drop it! 
He runs over and stamps it out as quickly as he can... 
JEREMY (CONT'D) Fucking faulty one... 
Sam nurses her burned hand. 
JEREMY (CONT'D) Are you okay? 
SAM I think so... 
Jeremy inspects her hand -- there's a large BLISTER. 
JEREMY You need to get that covered... 
Jeremy takes off his jacket. He then removes his T-shirt and starts to tear off a piece. 
SAM What are you doing? 
JEREMY It's okay... 
EXT. BANK - NIGHT 
The bank sign shows 8:59 PM. The display flashes to: JULY 4, 1995... It changes to the countdown: 00 DAYS, 00 HOURS, 00 MINUTES, 03 SECONDS... 02 SECONDS... 01 SECONDS... 
EXT. WOODED GROVE NEARBY - NIGHT 
Jeremy finishes wrapping the piece of his T-shirt around Sam's hand, creating the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE. 
JEREMY How's it feel? 
SAM A little better... 
The FIREWORKS suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the grove with bursts of bright, multi-colored lights. Sporadic METEORS rain down at the same time. It's magnificent. 
After a beat, Sam looks over at Jeremy... 
The fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to see that the raw, reddish RASH has spread to cover the greater part of it. 
SAM (CONT'D) Good God... 
Jeremy looks down as if he'd forgotten, then quickly picks up his jacket and puts it back on. 
SAM (CONT'D) (ALARMED) Is that from the meteorite? 
JEREMY I barely even notice it anymore. I'm sure it'll go away soon. 
He zips up his jacket tight. 
SAM Are you fucking kidding me? 
JEREMY Do you think I'm disgusting? 
The question takes Sam by surprise. 
SAM No... I just think you should get it looked at- 
Before Sam can finish, Jeremy crams his mouth into hers for a forceful kiss... 
Sam shoves him away sharply. 
SAM (CONT'D) What the hell are you doing? 
Jeremy stomps on the gas pedal, and Chris is forced to unhand him as his BMW navigates around the truck and barrels down the hill... 
EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - LATER - NIGHT 
As Chris approaches Vietnam Tom's squatting ground, the FIREWORKS DISPLAY is in the midst of the GRANDE FINALE. Showers of light BURST and CRACKLE in steady succession. PEOPLE SCREAM in approval from the parking area nearby... 
Chris comes upon Sam's lifeless form. 
CHRIS No... 
He stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body close... 
As he does this, Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him. Chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding Sam. The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them... 
Tom looks down at the two of them for a moment, then reaches down and picks up his BUNNY MASK. The EVIL GRIN is red with SAM'S BLOOD, and one of the teeth is missing... 
The last of the fireworks display occurs, leaving the night full of SMOKE, HELLISH CLOUDS and an increasing number of bright-tailed METEORS -- the APOCALYPSE. 
Amongst the churning clouds, a tornado-like PORTAL cuts through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town. It's swirling and vast, stretching down from limitless space... 
SAM (V.O.) 15 days... 18 hours... 
Tom puts on the BUNNY MASK... 
SAM (V.O.) (CONT'D)                 VIETNAM TOM 45 minutes... 6 seconds...      45 minutes... 6 seconds... 
And focuses on a single METEOR that plummets toward the yawning VORTEX, using telekinetic power to guide it... 
EXT. THE ETHER - NIGHT - POV INSIDE PORTAL 
The METEOR blazes through the WORMHOLE -- 
KEY SCENES IN REVERSE 
THE BARS TO THE JAIL CELL STRAIGHTEN -- 
THE WORDS `THOMAS WARD SPARROW' ARE LIFTED FROM THE BOOKING SLIP --

SAM'S FACE DIPS BENEATH THE SURFACE OF RANDY'S POOL -- TRANSITION TO: 
EXT. BANK - NIGHT 
The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to -- JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29 MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS... 
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT 
Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed. 
TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. The CLOCK/RADIO reads 3:30 AM. 
EXT. WINDMILL PLATFORM - NIGHT 
Vietnam Tom sits atop the platform, more than 30 feet up, wearing his ski mask and holding his rifle. The surface of the platform is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. 
Relaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky. As a TREMOR starts to build, he takes off his ski mask and gazes out over his town... 
He smiles. 
Suddenly, there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- CUT TO: 
CHARACTER MONTAGE 
Dusty sits and stares at his CELLAR DOOR... Trudy holds a PICTURE OF FATHER HOMEIJER and cries... Ruth snorts some COKE in her room... Jeremy scratches his LEFT FOREARM in his sleep... Billy Moorcroft shivers from the chill in his CAGE... Officer O'Dell sits alone in his patrol car, fingering the trigger of his PISTOL... TRANSITION TO: 
EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING 
Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere. Ground water spurts from the broken well seal. 
A cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the crater... 
Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite as Sam and O'Dell arrive on the scene. There are PARAMEDICS, a CORONER and other POLICEMEN there as well, and a large area has been cordoned off with POLICE TAPE. 
Corey is there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, Phil Coulter, and other local CITIZENS. TOM'S REMAINS are carried off in a BLACK BAG...

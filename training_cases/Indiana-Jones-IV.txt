INDIANA JONES IV 
INDIANA JONES IV a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Monkey King a.k.a. Indiana Jones and the Garden of Life 
A Screenplay by Chris Columbus 
FIRST DRAFT 
UNDERWATER - CLOSE-UP: A brightly colored FLY, attached to a dangling, fishing line. A large SALMON swims to the fly. The salmon EXAMINES the fly, deciding whether or not to bite. 
CAMERA PANS UPWARD, tracking the line and moving OUT OF THE WATER. We PASS the crooked boards of a small ROWBOAT and continue to PAN UPWARD. A MAN reclines in the boat. NAPPING. His hands gently grip a WOODEN FISHING POLE. He is handsomely dressed in SPORTSMAN'S trousers and a blazer. His green, tweed fishing hat is lowered OVER HIS FACE. Its brim is filled with various types of TACKLE and BAIT. 
It is DUSK. A warm, SUMMER evening. The boat rests on a calm lake, surrounded by MOORS. Thick night FOG has begun to settle over the entire area. 
TITLE: SCOTLAND. 1937. 
Suddenly, the man's fishing line becomes TAUT. The wooden pole BUCKLES. The man STIRS. He SITS UP, moving the hat from his face. CAMERA DOLLIES FORWARD, into a CLOSE UP of the man. It is INDIANA JONES. His face ANXIOUS... HOPEFUL... Indy begins to REEL in his catch. 
A VOICE interrupts. In the DISTANCE. 
MACGOWAN (O.S.) Doctor Jones!... Doctor Jones !... 
Indy TURNS to the direction of the sound, still STRUGGLING with the line. 
INDIANA'S POV 
Countless ORANGE FLAMES sparkle across the moors. The TORCHES are being carried by several members of a small village. The VILLAGERS are gathered behind a group of SIX POLICEMEN. The policemen are headed by INSPECTOR ANGUS MACGOWAN, a plump, balding fellow, with a veiny, bulbous nose, beady green eyes and a thick, curled red moustache. MacGowan SHOUTS to Indy. 
MACGOWAN We need your assistance! 
INDIANA (struggling with the fishing line) C'mon, Mac... It's the first bite I've had all week... 
MACGOWAN Please... It's very importantl... 
Indiana STRUGGLES a bit longer with the line. But his conscience prevails and Indy DROPS the fishing pole. With a GRUMBLE, he ROWS back to shore. 
THE MOORS - SEVERAL MINUTES LATER 
NIGHT has fallen. It is very DARK. A RELUCTANT Indiana has joined the Inspector and the other Policemen. They LEAD the townspeople along the foggy moors. Slowly, carefully, the villagers SEARCH... CREEPING... their faces tense, many unable to hide their FEAR. A summer wind sends an eeire HOWL whistling through the night air. Blue MOONLIGHT bathes the moors, creating stark, frightening shadows. 
An expression of ANGER and ANNOYANCE cover Indiana's face. He GRUMBLES to MacGowan. 
INDIANA Do you value our friendship, Mac? 
MACGOWAN More than me' nightly pint. 
INDIANA Then this better not be some wild goose chase... 
MACGOWAN T'ain't wild geese we're after, Doctor Jones. You got me' word on that... (sincere) ...and a MacGowan's word is truer than an angel's kiss! 
There is a sudden SCREAM! One of the villagers STUMBLES UPON something. Everyone GATHERS around the villager. 
A CORPSE lies before them. The body has a somewhat rubbery appearance, as if all of its bones had been BROKEN. The man's pale, greenish face is FROZEN in a hideous grimace. Indiana and MacGowan STARE in shock. The villagers WHISPER among themselves. 
YOUNG MAN Scotty Ferguson. 
OLD WOMAN He's the eighth. 
MAN Just like the others...all his bones busted...crushed... 
OLD MAN Whatever's killin' people around here ain't human. 
WOMAN (pointing OFFSCREEN) It's there! Again! 
The woman SHOOTS FORWARD. The police and the townspeople are right BEHIND her. A curious Indiana FOLLOWS. 
The woman stops in a CLEARING. She is POINTING ahead. The villagers SURROUND her. They STARE ahead, in the direction where the woman points. Nearly a mile in the distance, WE SEE 
AN ANCIENT SCOTTISH CASTLE. 
An enormous, 16th CENTURY stone structure. Tall, forboding towers, lined with menacing GARGOYLES, pierce the night sky. The castle appears DESERTED. Its interior is completely DARK, save for a small, flickering CANDLELIGHT. It burns from the castle's UPSTAIRS WINDOW. 
Indiana gives a QUESTIONING look to MacGowan. The Inpector points to the castle's upstairs window. 
MACGOWAN That light...only burns after a murder's been committed. 
INDIANA (nods, turning toward the castle) Let's go. 
The villagers STEP BACK. Eyes wide with FEAR. Murmers of 'Ain't goin' in there', 'Nor I', 'Got me a wife and kids', are heard from the TERRIFIED villagers. Indiana TURNS to MacGowan. Even the usually sturdy Inspector is TREMBLING. But MacGowan turns to his men, FORCING himself to be strong. 
MACGOWAN Well... Ahmmmm...that is what we're here for...eh, men?...ah... (points to men) Hennesey... Galbraith... Bottomley... You're comin' with us. 
The black knight is only a FEW FEET from Indy. Its deadly axe blade INCHES from Indy's face. Indiana MOVES FAST. He JERKS his body forward. This FLIPS the white knight off its feet! OVER Indy's head. The white knight FLIES INTO the black knight. CRASH! This sends both knights FALLING to the floor. 
Indiana SHOOTS to his feet. The two knights LEAP to their feet. They CHASE Indy. The black knight armed with his AXE, the white knight armed with a long, sharp SWORD! 
Baron Seagrove SPOONS another helping of boiled potatoes onto his plate. 
Indy snatches a SHIELD and SWORD from a nearby wall display. Ready to FIGHT. The knights are UPON HIM. Indiana battles BOTH knights. He DEFENDS the bludgeoning battle axe with his shield, and SWORDFIGHTS the other knight! THRASH! CLANG! The sound of HEAVY METAL fills the room! 
Indy's sword STRIKES the white knight's thick chest. The sword SNAPS IN TWO. In the confusion, Indy's shield is KNOCKED from his hand by the powerful battle axe. Indy is DEFENSLESS. 
The two metal giants RAISE their weapons. HIGH. AIMING for Indy's head. The two knights SWING! Indy DIVES to the floor! The knights CAN'T STOP their weapons in time... CRUNCH! They deliver a HARD BLOW to each other! The woozy knights WOBBLE and SPIN. In a momentary DAZE. Indiana JUMPS to his feet. 
The BLACK KNIGHT hisses. FURIOUS. He DASHES after Indiana. The WHITE KNIGHT is still REELING from the blow. 
Seeing the black knight in HOT PURSUIT, Indy searches for a WEAPON. He spots the curtain's long, thick ROPE. LYING on the floor. 
The black knight is nearly UPON Indy. AXE RAISED! Indiana GRABS the rope. He SPINS. FACING the knight. Indy SNAPS HIS WRIST! A LOUD CRACK! The rope SHOOTS FORWARD! Not unlike Indiana's familiar WHIP! 
The rope WRAPS itself around the black knight's neck. Indy JERKS the whip forward. HARD. This sends the knight FLYING THROUGH THE AIR! The knight crashes into the stone FOONTAIN! Several of the fountain's sculptures SHATTER into pieces. The dazed, dented black knight ATTEMPTS to stand...but LOSES his footing. The knight FALLS backward. Into the fountain's WIDE DRAIN OPENING! Its HEAVY ARMOR causes the knight to SINK. DISAPPEARING into the hole. Into the POOL OF WATER. 
Indy CATCHES HIS BREATH. The white knight's SWORD SWINGS INTO FRAME! SLICING through Indiana's jacket! Indy JUMPS BACK. The vicious white knight COMES toward him. 
Indiana TURNS to run. Finding himself at the BANQUET TABLE. Face to face with the ROASTED PIG. A few feet away, Baron Seagrove CONTINUES to dine. The white knight raises his sword ABOVE Indy. WHOOSH! The sword begins to swing DOWN! Indiana DUCKS and DODGES the deadly blows. Instead of carving Indiana, the knight's sword manages to SLICE perfect sections of the roasted pig. The satisfied Baron HELPS HIMSELF to a freshly carved slice of pork. 
Indiana LEAPS onto the table top. Trying to ESCAPE the living suit of armor. But the white knight CLIMBS up onto the table. FOLLOWING Indy. 
The sword slashing knight PURSUES Indy along the table top. Indy GLANCES upward. To the heavy CHANDELIER. Indy SMILES. A PLAN. He continues to STEP BACKWARD. Leading the knight DIRECTLY BELOW the chandelier. 
At the precise moment, Indy picks up a STERLING SILVER PLATE from the table top. Indy WHISKS the plate in the air. Toward the ROPE that holds the chandelier. The spinning plate SEVERS the rope. The chandelier FLIES DOWNWARDl! CRASHING ON TOP of the white knight! The knight lies BENEATH the chandelier. MOTIONLESS. The sword DROPS from its lifeless hand. Onto the TABLE TOP. 
Indy takes the knight's SWORD. Eyes on FIRE, sword OUTSTRETCHED, Indiana WALKS across the table top. HEADED for Baron Seagrove. 
The Baron prepares to take ANOTHER BITE of his food. THE SWORD SHOOTS INTO FRAME! The tip of the blade RESTS upon Baron Seagrove's rubbery throat. Indiana SNARLS. 
INDIANA Haven't you had enough? 
Baron Seagrove finally LOOKS at Indiana. The Baron LOWERS his fork. His face twists into an EERIE GRIN. He begins LAUGHING. It's the SAME MANIACAL LAUGH we heard earlier. Indy responds by BLOWING OUT the flame of the mysterious candle. 
The room's door BURSTS OPEN! INSPECTOR MACGOWAN and GALBRAITH dash inside. They HURRY to Baron Seagrove. Their PISTOLS aimed at him. Galbraith HANDCUFFS the Baron. MacGowan looks at the BRUISED, BLOODIED and TATTERED Indiana Jones. 
MACGOWAN Now you can get back to your fishing, Doctor Jones. 
INDIANA No chance, Mac. My plane leaves in the morning. Vacation's over. Gotta' get back to school. 
MACGOWAN (shakes his head) 'Tis a shame to go home empty handed... (smiles, an idea) Tell ya' what, my friend... I fancy me'self quite the fisherman... Tomorrow, I'll go out and catch you a real beauty, eh?... 
INDIANA (sarcastic smirk) Right. Send it to me airmail. 
MACGOWAN (incredulous) Doctor Jones! A MacGowan's word is truer than... 
INDIANA Yeah, yeah...an angel's kiss. I know. 
They EXIT the room. 
EXT. CASTLE 
The villagers SURROUND the castle. Their BRIGHT TORCHES are raised high in the air. Baron Seagrove is LED out of the castle by Indiana and the Police. The crowd begins to WHISPER. ANXIOUS. EXCITED. As the Baron is led to the POLICE VEHICLE, he turns and LOOKS at Indy. The Baron speaks in a TREMBLING, RASPY voice. His eyes are WILD. 
BARON SEAGROVE No...jail...can...hold...me. 
A CHILL rushes through Indiana. The Baron turns, CONTINUING to the Police wagon. One of the villagers SHOUTS. 
VILLAGER 'E's done it! Indiana Jones has captured the killer! 
The crowd CHEERS. Indiana gives a HUMBLE NOD and WAVE. MacGowan SHAKES Indy's hand. Indy glances to the POLICE VEHICLE. 
INDY'S POV 
Baron Seagrove CLIMBS into the back compartment of the police vehicle. Galbraith CLOSES the vehicle doors. The Baron is still VISIBLE through the vehicle's windows. He LIGHTS a cigarette. It appears that the MATCH FLAME SHINES THROUGH THE BARON'S BODY! It's as if he were a GHOST! 
Indiana TURNS to the others. Eyes WIDE. SHOCKED. But it is obvious that NO ONE else has SEEN the apparition. MacGowan notices the PALE expression on Indy's face. 
MACGOWAN What is it, man? You look as if you've seen a screamin' banshee! 
Indy POINTS back to the police vehicle. But it has already DEPARTED. It drives over a far hill, DISAPPEARING INTO THE NIGHT. Indy SIGHS, turning back to MacGowan. 
INDIANA Ah... It was nothing, Mac. Nothing at all. 
CAMERA DOLLIES INTO INDIANA'S TROUBLED, UNCERTAIN FACE. THE BARON'S LAUGH FILLS THE SOUND TRACK. 
SLOW DISSOLVE: 
POSTMAN (staring at Indy's signature, puzzled) What's this? "B+"? That's how you sign your name? 
Indy GRABS the paper. He's signed a "B+" on the LINE where his name is supposed to appear. Indy CROSSES out the grade and signs his name. Professor Coventry still LECTURES Indiana. 
DEAN COVENTRY Marshall University is not the place for sloppy behavior... 
At that moment, Indy OPENS the envelope! A LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER POURS OUT! SATURATING the papers on the desk! This is followed by an ENORMOUS DEAD TROUT! It FLOPS onto Indy's desk. The students exchange STARTLED and NAUSEOUS glances. Indiana removes a water logged NOTE from the envelope. It reads, "A MACGOWAN'S WORD IS TRUER THAN AN ANGEL'S KISS". Indiana uses a TISSUE to WIPE some of the water from his desk. Dean Coventry SHAKES A FINGER at Indy. 
DEAN COVENTRY I have one final warning for you, Doctor Jones -- 
THE PHONE RINGS! INTERRUPTING the Dean! Indiana quickly ANSWERS the phone. A FUMING Dean Coventry impatiently waits to finish his threat. Indiana SPEAKS into the receiver. 
INDIANA Yes... Oh, Hello, Marcus... Look, can you hold on?... (back to Dean) You were saying, sir? 
DEAN COVENTRY Either you begin concentrating on your -- 
INDIANA (interrupted by phone) Yes, Marcus... I'm still here... Just hold on! (back to Dean) I'm very sorry, sir... 
DEAN COVENTRY (boiling) -- concentrating on your teaching duties or -- 
INDIANA (into phone) Damn it, Marcus! I'm standing here with Dean... What?.. Just how important?... (listening, impatient) It is, huh?... Okay. Five minutes. Yeah. I'll be right over. But this better be important, Marcus! 
Indiana HANGS UP. He gives an EMBARASSED look to the furious, red faced Dean. 
DEAN COVENTRY You are on probation, Jones! Ten days! If there is no improvement, you will be dismissed! 
The Dean STORMS OUT of the room. Indiana GATHERS the wet papers. He begins to EXIT the room, EXPLAINING to the students as he makes his way through the crowd. 
INDIANA I promise...by tomorrow...I'll have all of these graded...and DRIED! 
Indiana continues making APOLOGIES and EXCUSES. The obnoxious student again SHOUTS at him. 
VIRGIL VIRGIL VEKTOR! Capital V... I... R... 
INDIANA (hands him paper) "F"! 
Virgil STARES at his paper, adorned with a large RED "F"! Indiana EXITS the room. 
INT. HISTORY MUSEUM - PREHISTORIC ROOM 
The large room is filled with skeletons, fossils and statues dating back to the DAWN OF MAN. Indiana, his arms cluttered with the soaking term papers, hurriedly enters the museum with MARCUS BRODY. Marcus is very ANXIOUS. EXCITED. He carries a l6MM METAL FILM CANNISTER beneath his arm. Indiana is very IMPATIENT. His eyes dart to a full sized skeleton of a TYRONOSAURUS REX. 
INDIANA This better be important, Marcus... or the museum will soon be displaying my bones. My teaching career is in danger of extinction. 
MARCUS (smiles) You will not be disappointed, Indiana. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE-UP: AN ANCIENT PAINTING. The watercolor features an upright, wrinkled face SUN WU KUNG, the STONE MONKEY KING. But the monkey is NOT made of stone. He appears to be HALF HUMAN... HALF MONKEY. His face is WISE. His coal black eyes are PENETRATING. He wears a LION SKIN ROBE, and holds a tall, GOLDEN HOOPED STAFF. Sun Wu Kung stands amidst a garden of luscious, ripe PEACE TREES. He is surrounded by a HEAVENLY GLOW, a bright ray of light that emanates from an opening in the CLOUDS. 
MARCUS (O.S.) ...Look familiar? 
CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are inside of the museum BOARD ROOM. Marcus holds the tattered painting before Indiana, who sits at a desk, still feverishly GRADING the wet term papers. After he finishes each paper, Indy PINS it to a nearby bulletin board for drying. He GLANCES to the painting of Sun Wu Kung. 
INDIANA "Sun wu Kung, The Stone Monkey King". Big deal. That was ten years ago, Marcus. (going back to papers, wanting to change subject) Geez! This Heller kid's got the worst grammar. 
MARCUS Ten years or fifty years. It will always be in your blood. 
INDIANA (ignoring Marcus) Don't believe this... He spells "repeat" with two "E's". 
MARCUS Think back, Indiana. Remember your desire? Your passion? 
INDIANA (still ignores Marcus) Kid gets an "A" on content...a "D" on form. 
MARCUS (angry, slams his fist on the desk) Damn it, man! You can't bury those feelings forever! 
Indiana finally LOOKS UP from the papers. He glances at Marcus, then LOOKS at the painting. CAMERA DOLLIES INTO Indiana's face. He becomes very SERIOUS. SOMBER. His eyes are EMPTY. Memories of FAILURE fill his head. 
INDIANA Two years. Nearly two years of my life...looking for the remains of that Monkey...a piece of his legendary Golden Hooped Rod...or some sign of the Lost City. (shakes his head) Nine men perished on the journey. Rest of us nearly died from starvation or one of the many horrible deseases we discovered... (looks back to papers, in a near whisper) We still came back empty handed. 
MARCUS (threading the projector) One mustn't give up so easily, Indiana. 
INDIANA Give up?!?... Marcus, we spent thirteen months in China!...another seven in India!... 
MARCUS But none in Africa. 
INDIANA (puzzled expression) There was no proof...archeological or anthropological...to indicate that Sun Wu-Kung ever visited Africa... 
MARCUS Until now. 
Marcus TURNS OFF the room lights. 
INDIANA stands in the background. He is hurriedly PACKING his bags. His familiar GUN, HAT and WHIP lie on the bed, beside the suitcase. Indy NOTICES that Betsy is crying. He WALKS to Betsy. Indy puts his arm on Betsy's shoulder, attempting to COMFORT her. Betsy SNAPS at Indy. 
BETSY You can't do this to me! 
INDIANA (shaking tears off the papers) C'mon, Betsy. Relax. You're gettin' 'em all wet again. 
BETSY You just can't go away...I mean... Africa is so far away, and...well... (heartfelt) I love you, Indy. 
INDIANA Thought we agreed this was s'posed to be casual... 
BETSY You call what happened last night "casual". 
INDIANA My dear...a momentary lapse into passion does not a love affair make. 
BETSY (very upset) Momentary lapse! So that's all I am to you! 
Betsy SHOOTS to her feet, walking OFF SCREEN. 
INDIANA Betsy... Wait... 
Indiana SIGHS. His eye CATCHES one of the termpapers. He begins to READ, making a few CORRECTIONS. 
We see Betsy's HAND removes Indiana's WHIP from the bed. 
Indiana continues to CORRECT the papers. Suddenly, there is a CREAKING NOISE. Indy TURNS. His face goes WHITE. He runs OFF SCREEN. 
One end of Indiana's WHIP is attached to an OVERHEAD LAMP. CAMERA PANS DOWN the whip. The other end has been formed into a NOOSE around Betsy's neck. Sbe stands on a wooden CHAIR. She KICKS AWAY the chair. Suddenly GAGGING. Indiana GRABS Betsy in midair. He TAKES the noose from her neck and PLACES Betsy on the floor. 
INDIANA (angry) Whatsa' matter with you!... Tryin' to ruin my whip!... 
BETSY If I can't have you... I don't want to live. 
Indiana TOSSES the whip into his suitcase. He pulls up the chair and forces Betsy to be SEATED. He pours her a tall glass of BOURBON. 
INDIANA Drink this. You'll feel better. 
Indiana WALKS to his suitcase, continuing to pack. His BACK is to Betsy. She raises the GLASS to her lips. She PAUSES, reading a MESSAGE on the Bourbon bottle. It reads: DANGER! CONTENTS FLAMMABLE! Betsy BEAMS. An IDEA. She LIFTS the bottle over her head and begins to DOUSE her body with the liquid. 
Indiana is BUSY folding his clothing. Suddenly, we hear the FLICK OF A MATCHSTICK! Indy TURNS. He sees the bourbon covered Betsy preparing to LIGHT HER BODY ON FIRE! Indy DASHES forward. He BLOWS OUT the match, moments before it SPARKS Betsy's clothing. Indy SHAKES Betsy by the shoulders. 
INDIANA C'mon, Betsy... Get a hold of yourself. You're young. There are a lot of other guys... 
BETSY Not like you. 
INDIANA (succumbing to his ego) That's true... (realizing his mistake) But that's no reason to stop living! Besides, I'm too old for you. By the time you're seventy five, I'll be... (calculates, the thought of it makes him grimace) Yeccchhh! I'll be disgusting. 
Indiana TURNS and finishes his packing. Betsy SIGHS. She notices an enormous, STONE AFRICAN URN. The 150 POUND antique sits atop a section of BOOKSHELVES. 
Meanwhile, Indiana makes certain that his gun is PACKED. He places the familiar HAT on his head and begins to CLOSE the suitcase. 
CLOSE UP: THE AFRICAN URN. It is WOBBLING. SHAKING. Moving CLOSER and CLOSER to the edge of the bookshelves. CAMERA PANS TO THE FLOOR. Betsy LIES here. Directly BELOW the trembling urn. Betsy SHAKES the bookshelves, causing the urn to TILT and SHIVER. The urn is nearly HALFWAY OFF of the edge. If it falls...the urn will CRUSH Betsy's head. 
Indiana STRUGGLES with closing his tightly packed suitcase. 
The urn FALLS! HEADED STRAIGHT for Betsy! Indiana SUDDENLY GRABS the urn. In MIDAIR. Inches before it STRIKES Betsy. Indiana RESTS the urn on the floor. He HELPS Betsy to her feet. Betsy WRAPS her arms tightly around Indiana. 
BETSY Don't leave me, Indy! 
Indiana PICKS UP his suitcase and tries to WALK to the door. But Betsy's arms are still TIGHTLY WRAPPED around him. Finally, Indy STOPS. His eyes BURN through Betsy. 
INDIANA (cruel) Look... You're just a flighty kid. Twenty minutes after I walk out this door, you'll have a date with the college Romeo. Two hours from now, you'll be madly in love with him. By tomorrow, you'll forget I ever existed. 
Hurt, Betsy REMOVES her arms from Indiana. He gives her a QUICK KISS to the cheek and hurriedly EXITS. Betsy GLARES at the closed door. A TOUGH, ANGRY expression covers her face. 
BETSY Never underestimate the determination of a Brooklyn girl, Doctor Jones. Never. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
LONG SHOT - AN OCEAN LINER 
The SILHOUETTE of the ship sails across the water. A beautiful ORANGE SKY fills the background. 
INDIANA JONES 
stands aboard the ship's DECK. It is a typical, 30's LUXURY Ocean liner, filled with vacationing TOURISTS. Indiana STARES into the sunrise. His face is a study in CONCENTRATION and INTENSITY. He anxiously AWAITS his adventure. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
MAP OF THE WORLD 
A MOVING RED LINE traces Indiana's journey across the ocean, toward AFRICA. The red line comes to a stop at MOZAMBIQUE. 
PORTER You left this aboard ship. 
INDIANA (puzzled) There must be some mistake... I didn't -- 
The Porter POINTS to a section of the barrel that reads: DELIVER TO: DR. INDIANA JONES. 
PORTER That's you, ain't it? 
INDIANA Well, yeah...but... 
The Porter DROPS the barrel in front of Indiana and hurriedly WALKS back to the ship. 
SGT. GUTTERBUHG continues to SPY on Indiana. The Nazi HIDES a few feet away. In a DARK alleyway. 
A puzzled Indiana begins to OPEN the barrel. Scraggy SHOUTS a warning. 
SCRAGGY Indy! Remember Mahootmek, God Of Goodness! "Before body make contact with foreign object -- " 
Indiana IGNORES Scraggy and begins to PRY OPEN the barrel. 
SCRAGGY "...you must cast out bad spirits!" 
Indiana still IGNORES Scraggy. He STRUGGLES with the barrel top, FLIRTING with Clare. 
INDIANA May I call you "Clare"? 
CLARE Please. 
INDIANA Well, Clare... We've obviously got a lot of notes to compare... Let's get started tonight...over dinner. 
CLARE I'd like that very much. 
INDIANA Friend of mine owns a Cafe... He'll get us a nice quiet table. No disturbances. Just the two of us -- 
At that moment, the barrel lid FLIES OFF! The inside if FILLED with old, brown BANANA PEELS. Suddenly, BETSY'S HEAD POKES THROUGH the peels! Indiana is SHOCKED. Scraggy SIGHS. 
SCRAGGY I warn you, Indy! You must always cast out bad spirits! 
A dirty, unkempt Betsy LEAPS OUT OF THE BARREL! She THROWS her arms around Indy. 
BETSY My precious! 
CLARE (puzzled, to Indy) Your daughter? 
INDIANA My assistant. 
BETSY His girlfriend. 
CLARE (revolted) A child! 
INDIANA (to Clare) It's nothing. Really. (to Betsy) What the hell are you doing here'? 
BETSY Proving my love for you. 
CLARE How terribly sordid. 
INDIANA (to Clare) Puppy love. Schoolgirl crush. She'll get over it. 
BETSY Never. This proves that nothing can come between us. Not an ocean. Not two separate Continents. 
CLARE Think I'm going to be ill. 
INDIANA (puzzled, to Betsy) How...I mean... How could you stay alive? 
BETSY Hey... I'm from Brooklyn. 
INDIANA But we'ye been sailing for three weeks! 
BETSY Stowed away in the banana barrel. Ate my way to the bottom. 
CLARE (nauseous) Charming. 
BETSY (pointing to Clare) Hey, Indy... Who's the babe? 
CLARE Your intellectual and emotional superior. 
BETSY Yeah...well you're gettin' on my nerves, Miss... Miss... 
CLARE (extends her hand) "Doctor" Clare Clarke. 
BETSY (reluctantly shaking Clare's hand) Betsy Tuffet... 
CLARE (shrugs) Just basic manners. What it takes most men a lifetime to learn... Tyki's accomplished in two weeks. (introduces Scraggy) This is our guide, Scraggy Brier... and Miss Bets-- 
Clare pauses, noticing that Betsy is MISSING. Clare suddenly breaks into a LAUGH! She points OFF SCREEN. Everyone TURNS. 
EXT. COMPOOND 
Bonzo is being extremely AFFECTIONATE toward Betsy. The chimpanzee PULLS and GRABS at Betsy. It is all VERY SIMILIAR to what Betsy has been doing to Indiana. Betsy WRESTLES with Bonzo, CALLING Indy for help. 
INT. CAGE 
Everyone CHUCKLES at Betsy's dillemma. 
CLARE It appears that Bonzo is attracted to Miss Tuffet's Derfume... Eau De Banana Peel. 
Tyki has gone back to his ARTWORK. A FASCINATED Indiana looks over the pygmy's shoulder. 
INDIANA Where did you find him?... 
CLARE About ten miles from here. We were on a photographic expedition...in the thick of the jungle... I heard sounds. Whimpering. Moaning. I took a few steps, and found Tyki. He was lying in a shallow swamp...semi conscious...a high fever...nearly dead from exhaustion. He had obviously been travelling on foot for many days, over countless miles... So I brought him back to the compound...nursed him back to health... 
Indiana STARES at the pygmy. A skeptical look COVERS his face. 
INDIANA Clare, I hate to quibble with your anthropological abilities... 
CLARE Quibble. 
INDIANA ...but if this little fellow is over 200 years old... I mean... What accounts for his youthful appearance?...his vitality?... 
Clare OPENS a door at the rear of the cage. It LEADS into another room, directly behind the CAGE. Clare and Indiana ENTER. Scraggy STAYS behind. He EXCHANGES a friendly smile with Tyki. Meanwhile, in the BACKGROUND, we see BETSY and the CHIMPANZEE. They ROLL BY on the ground. Still WRESTLING. 
CLOSE UP: PEACE STONE. 
A FRUIT FLY crawls along the peach pit's surface. 
CLARE (O.S.) Tyki was wearing this when I found him. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK. We are in a SMALL, STERILE ROOM. The peach stone rests on a TABLE. Indiana and Clare STAND over the stone. Indy PICKS UP the stone, examining it. An annoying FRUIT FLY buzzes around Indy's head. CAMERA PANS DOWN to Indiana's trouser leg. The RADIO TRANSMITTOR is still attached to his pants. The tiny bug's eyes BLINK. RED. 
CUT TO: 
SGT. GUTTERBUHG. 
He stands inside of Nazi Headquarters, huddled over the RADIO. The VOICES of Indiana and Clare echo over the speaker. Gutterbuhg FURIOUSLY transcribes the conversation. 
CLARE (O.S.) Dr. Jones, you are obviously familiar with the legend of Sun Wu- King's Garden of Immortal Peaches?... 
INDIANA (O.S.) A bite from the fruit of that peach tree would give a person eternal life...make them forever young... 
The vicious Gutterbuhg SMILES. CAMERA PANS to his notebook. Gutterbuhg underlines the words "FOREVER YOUNG". 
CUT BACK TO: 
INDIANA 
STUDYING the peach pit. The fruit fly continues to BUZZ around Indiana's head. 
INDIANA There's nothing unusual about this ...nothing to indicate that it's from Sun Wu Kung's garden... 
The fruit fly LANDS on Indiana's neck. Indy SMACKS the fly! KILLING it! A SHOCKED Clare RUNS to Indiana. She GRABS his hand and GENTLY removes what remains of the fruit fly. She GLARES at Indiana. FURIOUS. 
CLARE This fruit fly had a normal life- span of TWENTY FOUR HOURS. (frustrated sigh) As an experiment...the fly was put in this room...alone...with only the peach stone to sustain its existence. The fly stayed alive for THREE WEEKS. (looks at dead fly) Until now. 
She FLICKS the'fly against the wall. Indy gives an EMBARASSED SHRUG. 
INDIANA Sorry. 
Indiana and Clare are suddenly INTERRUPTED by the sound of Scraggy and Tyki's LAUGHTER. This is followed by the two of them having a DISCUSSION! In Tyki's FOREIGN TONGUE! Clare and Indy exchange a SHOCKED GLANCE and DASH out of the room. 
INT. CAGE 
Scraggy and Tyki are having a CONVERSATION. Clare POINTS to Scraggy, giving a PUZZLED LOOK to Indiana. 
CLARE He understands him? 
INDIANA (nods) Scraggy knows hundreds of languages... He's the best guide in Africa. (turns to Scraggy) Ask Tyki where he came from. 
Scraggy NODS and ASKS Tyki. Tyki ANSWERS and POINTS to the painting of the clouds. Scraggy TRANSLATES. 
SCRAGGY He say... "I come from 'Land Of City On Clouds'". 
INDIANA (puzzled) Huh?... What the hell's that s'posed to mean? (to Scraggy) Can he take us there? 
ABOVE the table, Clare shoots a scowl of DISAPPROVAL at Indy. A FLUSTERED Indy tries to explain...but is suddenly INTERRUPTED by a hand on his shoulder. It is DASHIELL, the suave, HANDSOME owner of the restaurant. Dashiell gives a CaARMING SMILE to everyone at the table. 
DASHIELL Enjoying your dinners?... 
Everyone NODS, expressing their thanks. Dashiell LEANS close to Indiana and WHISPERS. 
DASHIELL Watch yourself, sport. Most of the talk here tonight is about you. And it isn't good. 
Indiana's eyes DART around the room. He sees the VARIOUS NAZIS. WATCHING him. Indy gives a CONFIDENT SMILE. A WORRIED Dashiell continues WHISPERING to Indiana. 
DASHIELL I don't know what you've done to the Nazis. But they are certainly no friends of yours. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ZOOLOGICAL COMPOUND 
DARK. SILENT. Many of the animals are ASLEEP in their cages. A SECURITY GUARD keeps watch on the compound. He STANDS outside of the METAL GATES. There is a SUDDEN SOUND. The guard TURNS. 
THE FIGURES OF THREE MEN stand before him. In the SHADOWS. The NERVOUS Guard places a hand on his holster. 
GUARD Who's there?... 
We hear a MECHANICAL CREAK. A MAN'S LEATHER GLOVED HAND extends from the shadows. The hand's FINGER is POINTED at the Security GUARD. 
CLOSE UP: VARIOUS ANIMALS 
The sound of RAPID MACHINE GUN FIRE echoes throughout the camp! CAMERA RECORDS the animal's SHOCKED REACTIONS! 
THE SECURITY GUARD 
lies on the GROUND. DEAD. His body riddled with BULLETS. The SHINY, BLACK BOOTS of the three men PASS his body. We notice that one of the boot's SHOELACES are untied. 
TYKI 
STARES into the dark night. FEAR covers his face. He is SEATED inside of his cage. A CANDLE flickers beside him. Tyki's hands REST on the beautiful tapestry. Tyki LISTENS. He hears FOOTSTEPS. COMING toward his cage. Tyki REACHES to his side. He grabs a STONE DAGGER. 
Suddenly, a LOOD GONSHOT! The SPLINTERED LOCK from Tyki's cage goes spinning across the floor. The cage door CREAKS OPEN. 
GUTTERBUHG stands in the doorway. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS, HELMUT and KLACE (who we met earlier), are beside him. Gutterbuhg SMILES. His stiff right arm EXTENDS from his side. His leather gloved INDEX FINGER is POINTING ahead. 
Tyki GROWLS at the Nazis. He STANDS. RAISING the stone dagger OVER HIS HEAD. 
Gutterbuhg's FINGER BEGINS TO RAPIDLY FIRE BULLETS! His MECHANICAL ARM is actually a A MACEINE GUN! 
The bullets TEAR through Tyki's tapestry. They make a crooked, tattered line through the BEAUTIFOL WORK. DESTROYING it. A terrified Tyki WATCHES. 
Gutterbuhg STOPS shooting. He REMOVES the empty cartridge from a SLOT in his mechanical arm, and REPLACES it with another. He points the DEADLY FINGER at Tyki. A trembling Tyki DROPS the dagger. The three NAZIS walk toward the helpless pygmy. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DASHIELL'S BAR 
Indiana, Scraggy and Clare CONTINUE to excitedly STUDY the map. A NEGLECTED Betsy POURS herself the last of the wine. She is very DRUNK, singing along with the band's version of Cole Porter's "Night and Day". 
BENEATH THE TABLE 
Betsy continues to RUB her FOOT against Indiana's leg. 
INDIANA 
tries to IGNORE Betsy's playing. Scraggy continues to TRANSLATE the scroll. 
SCRAGGY "With his Golden Hooped Rod, And its powerful lightning rays, Sun Wu Kung build Water Curtain Cave, Where he live for 500 days." 
CLARE The Golden Hooped Rod? 
INDIANA A heavenly staff with many different powers...most notably, it had the ability to transform itself into hundreds of objects... (staring) It remains the most priceless treasure of Sun Wu Kung's empire. 
CLARE And what is the...the Water Curtain Cave? 
INDIANA Sun Wu Kung's legendary hideout...an enormous secret cave, hidden behind a running waterfall. 
Clare again REACHES for her coffee. The cup and saucer are still TREMBLING. Clare PEEKS under the table, and again SEES Betsy's foot RUBBING Indiana's leg. Clare gives a revolted GRUMBLE. Indiana EXCITEDLY explains Scraggy's translation. 
INDIANA This proves that the Water Curtain Cave exists in Africa... (to Scraggy) Does it mention anything about Sun Wu Kung's travels? 
SCRAGGY (reading scroll) Only place called..."Twisted Snake Water". 
INDIANA The Zarnbesi River! It has a reputation for its deadly water snakes... 
CLARE It would have been Sun Wu Kung's logical path. 
The Nazi speedboat is HEADED TOWARD THE SIDE OF AN ENORMOUS OCEAN LINER! Gutterbuhg RADIOS for help. Indiana and Klaus continue to FIGHT. ROLLING along the deck. Exchanging PUNCHES. A bound Tyki watches with WIDE EYES. HELPLESS. 
The speedboat makes a sudden SHARP TURN. AVOIDING A COLLISION with the Ocean liner. Indiana and Klaus TUMBLE OFF, THE BOAT! INTO THE WATER! 
UNDERWATER 
Indiana and Klaus CONTINUE their battle. They wrestle only a few feet from the ship's large, SPINNING STEEL PROPELLERS. The propellers create a SUCTION FORCE. DRAWING Indy and Klaus CLOSER... CLOSER... toward a SPINNING DEATH. 
Indy and Klaus grab hold of a dangling, STEEL ANCHOR. PREVENTING their bodies from being sucked into the propellers. Klaus PULLS a switchblade from his pocket. He ATTACKS Indy's CLENCHED FINGERS with the knife. Indy begins to LOSE HIS GRIP. His body INCHES toward the propellers. Klaus RAISES the knife, to FINISH OFF Indiana... 
But Klaus' UNTIED SHOELACE dangles beside the propellers. The shoelace CATCHES a spinning blade. The SHOCKED Nazi is pulled INTO THE PROPELLERS! 
Indiana TURNS AWAY, holding TIGHTLY to the anchor. A BLOOD RED CLOUD surges through the surrounding water. Indiana CLIMBS the anchor to safety. 
ABOVE WATER 
Indiana SURFACES. Taking a GULP of air. Suddenly, the water in front of him erupts with MACHINE GUN FIRE. Indiana SEES 
GOTTERBUHG! He has PARKED the Nazi speedboat only a FEW FEET AWAY. Gutterbuhg SMILES, pointing his FINGER at the helpless Indiana. A SITTING DUCK. Gutterbuhg SMILES. 
GUTTERBUHG Goodnight, Doctor Jones. 
There is a LOUD GUNSHOT! Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm is HIT BY A BULLET! Pieces of SPRING, METAL and SPROCKETS fly from the wound. Gutterbuhg TURNS. FURIOUS. 
DASHIELL, the nightclub owner, is a few feet away. He is driving a sleek SPEEDBOAT, its side adorned with the AMERICAN FLAG. Dashiell points a PISTOL at Gutterbuhg, ready to take ANOTHER SHOT... 
With a ROAR, The Nazi speedboat DRIVES AWAY! Toward a CLUSTER OF DOCKS! Indiana CLIMBS into Dashiell's speedboat. 
DASHIELL Scraggy said you might be needing some help, sport. 
Dashiell HITS the gas. TEARING after the Nazis. 
A FRENZIED, HIGH SPEED CHASE BEGINS! Through the DARKNESS. Beneath the ROWS OF DOCKS. The speedboats face countless OBSTACLES. They SWERVE around a virtual forest of wooden poles, which FLY BY AT BREAKNECK SPEED! The men DUCK and DODGE dangling FISH HOOKS and NETS. Many paths are BLOCKED by the wooden RAFTS and ROWBOATS. (NOTE: Because of the darkness, these obstacles APPEAR only when they are a FEW FEET AHEAD of the speedboats. This makes the chase completely SURPRISING and SCARY, causing a FUNHOUSE effect.) 
Throughout the chase, Indiana and the Nazis continue to exchange GUNFIRE. A frustrated Gutterbuhg CAN'T SHOOT. His mechanical-machine gun arm rendered USELESS by Dashiell's bullet. He continues to RADIO Nazi headquarters for help. 
Dashiell CATCHES UP with the Nazis. The two speedboats travel SIDE BY SIDE. Their edges SCRAPE together. SPARKS fly. The recovered Helmut AIMS his luger at Indiana... But Indy LEAPS toward the Nazi. The two FALL. ROLLING. TUMBLING. STRUGGLING for the gun. They fight BETWEEN the two speedboats. The crack below them slightly OPENING and CLOSING. 
Up ahead, an ENORMOUS STONE POLE appears. To AVOID a collision, the speedboats MUST SEPARATE. Dashiell SCREAMS. 
DASHIELL Indy! Rollout! 
Indy FREES himself from Helmut and ROLLS back onto Dashiell's boat. Helmut LOOKS UP. He sees the stone pole AHEAD. COMING AT HIM. Helmut tries to MOVE...TOO LATE. The two boats SEPARATE. Helmut SMACKS into the pole! CRUSHED! 
Dashiell TURNS AWAY from the wheel, looking at Indiana. 
DASHIELL You okay, sport? 
Indiana begins to answer...then sees SOMETHING. AHEAD. He SCREAMS. 
INDIANA Dash!... 
Dashiell TURNS BACK. The speedboat is HEADED STRAIGHT FOR A SOLID WOODEN WALL! A sign on the wall reads: FUTTERMAN'S FISHING WAREHOUSE. 
The Nazi speedboat has already made a SHARP TURN, AVOIDING the warehouse. There's NO TIME for Dashiell to TURN. Indy HITS the deck. The speedboat ARCHES upward, at an ANGLE... CRASH! The speedboat BLASTS into the warehouse. Splintered wood SPLATTERS through the air. 
INT. WAREHOUSE 
Dashiell's speedboat BURSTS through another wall. The boat SKIDS across the warehouse floor. SCREECHING TO A STOP! A SHAKEN Dashiell gets out. Indy RUNS to the window. 
INDIANA'S POV 
The NAZI SPEEDBOAT shoots out of the docks, ESCAPING across the water. 
Indiana grabs his WHIP. He KICKS OPEN the warehouse window. He SNAPS his wrist. CRACK. The whip SHOOTS forward, ATTACHING ITSELF TO THE REAR OF THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! Indy firmly GRIPS his end of the whip. The whip TIGHTENS. WHOOSH! Indiana is PULLED out of the window. 
Gutterbuhg exchanges a VICTORIOUS laugh with Rudolph, the speedboat driver, thinking they have LOST Indiana. A frightened Tyki LOOKS BACK. His eyes suddenly fill with HOPE. Gutterbuhg TURNS. His mouth DROPS OPEN. 
Indiana uses his WHIP to WATER SKI BEHIND THE NAZI SPEEDBOAT! A red faced Gutterbuhg SLAMS his fist on the dashboard. He removes a SHARP KNIFE. He hurriedly begins to SLICE through Indy's whip. Trying to BREAK THE CONNECTION. 
Indiana AIMS his pistol at Gutterbuhg. But suddenly, a SHOT WHIZZES by Indy's head. Followed by ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. COMING from behind. Indy TURNS. A SECOND NAZI SPEEDBOAT is in HOT PURSUIT! There are FIVE NAZIS inside. Armed with PISTOLS and RIFLES. All FIRING SHOTS at Indiana. 
Meanwhile, Gutterbuhg's knife continues to SLICE through Indy's whip. Only a FEW THREADS remain. 
Indiana performs some EXPERT WATER SKIING. SWERVING. SPINNING. JUMPING. All in an attempt to AVOID the flying bullets from behind. Suddenly, Indy's whip SNAPS! Indiana FALLS UNDERWATER! Directly IN THE PATH of the seccnd Nazi speedboat! 
Tyki HIDES his eyes. Gutterbuhg LAUGHS. It appears that Indiana has met a GRISLY DEATH. 
The Nazis in the second speedboat are DELIGHTED. SHAKING each other's hands. CAMERA PANS TO BELOW the speedboat. We move UNDERWATER. SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS! We see INDIANA. Very much ALIVE. He STRADDLES THE BOTTOM OF THE SPEEDING BOAT! HOLDING ON with all of his strength! Indiana CLIMBS toward the side of the speedboat, BATTLING the pressure of the rushing water. 
CAMERA FOLLOWS INDIANA, OUT OF THE WATER, AS HE CLIMBS ABOARD THE SECOND SPEEDBOAT. The four Nazis are LAUGHING. TALKING. Their backs turned to the APPROACHING Indiana. Moving like LIGHTNING, Indy GRABS one of the Nazis and TOSSES HIM OVERBOARD. With a SWIFT PUNCH to the stomach and jaw, Indy sends another Nazi INTO THE WATER. The other two Nazis TACKLE Indy. They FALL to the deck. FIGHTING. 
INDIANA Scraggy's takin' a shower. 
Indy points OFF SCREEN. Scraggy, fully clothed, STANDS here. He rubs a large, FRESH ONION over his FACE, ARMS and LEGS. SQUEEZING the onion JUICE over his body. Indiana EXPLAINS to a befuddled Clare. 
INDIANA He believes that onions keep bad spirits from entering his body. 
CLARE (writing in her notebook) In all my years of anthropology... I've never run across anyone or anything quite like Scraggy. 
INDIANA (chuckles) He's a rare breed. (turns, looks at Clare for the first time) You're looking very lovely. 
CLARE You're looking very lecherous. 
INDIANA (turns away, angry) Just tryin' to be friendly. 
CLARE Save it for the schoolgirls. 
INDIANA Look, Clare... Betsy's just an anxious archeology student...she admires my work... (egotistical shrug) Who can blame her?... (back to his point) But it's just some kinda' hero worship thing... 
There was never any romance. 
BETSY (pops in from OFF SCREEN, kisses Indiana) I dreamed about our first night together! 
Indy SIGHS. Clare DISGUSTINGLY shakes her head. She continues to scrawl more into her notebook. Indiana gives her a STARTLED look. 
INDIANA You're writin' this down?... 
CLARE (nods) I'm keeping an accurate record of our journey. 
INDIANA What's that got to do with my personal life? 
CLARE Evidence. I plan on testifying at your child molestation trial. 
Indiana SHAKES his head. STARING into the distance. He SIGHS. 
INDIANA Why do I do this to myself? 
Holding her head in PAIN, Betsy turns to Clare. 
BETSY (holds her head in pain, to Clare) Hey, lady...you're s'posed to be a Doctor...you got any cures for a hangover?... 
CLARE The best I've heard was used by a New Zealand Tribe... (pauses, thinking) One part crushed owl skull...two parts rhino saliva...one part zebra dandruff. 
Betsy's face becomes PALE. Indy INTERRUPTS. 
INDIANA No, No... Get a cup of donkey sweat ...two spoons of skunk hair...and one pint of shredded lizard tongue. 
Betsy turns a light shade of GREEN. Scraggy ARGUES. 
SCRAGGY I always use family cure! Two spoons chopped leeches... Half cup horse mucous...two quarts crocodile urine! 
BETSY (ready to throw up) Ex...cuse...me...! 
Betsy runs OFF SCREEN. The others exchange a SHRUG. Scraggy LOOKS at the river ahead. 
SCRAGGY How far we travel, Indy?... 
INDIANA Almost 20 miles. 
CLARE Any sign of the Nazis? 
INDIANA (shakes his head, confident) Long as we keep up this pace... they'll have trouble tracking us. 
CAMERA PANS from the hopeful faces of Indiana, Scraggy and Clare, to the CABIN behind them. Here, a CREW MEMBER HIDES in the shadows. His face HIDDEN. He HOLDS a small radio receiver. He WHISPERS into the receiver. Speaking in perfect GERMAN. 
CUT TO: 
GUTTERBUBG. 
He is seated in NAZI HEADQUARTERS. He repairs his detached, MACHINE GUN ARM, which sits on the table before him. Behind Gutterbuhg, a GROUP OF NAZIS listen to the radio transmission of Scraggy's treacherous Crew Member, who discloses the LOCATION of the River Boat. The Nazis CHART out the boat's exact location on a large, WALL MAP. LIEUT. MEPHISTO supervises the project. Tyki, BOUND, GAGGED and BRUISED, watches from a corner. MEPHISTO looks at all the Nazis. 
MEPHISTO (German, English subtitles) We must leave. Immediately. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE. 
VARIOUS SHOTS of exotic animals. A creeping PANTHER. A sleeping WHITE BAT. A tense SCORPION. A family of CROCODILES. 
ABOARD SHIP 
Indiana, Scraggy, Clare and Betsy are GATHERED on the deck. Seated in a CIRCLE. They are surrounded by the CREW MEMBERS. Everyone eats their DINNER from tin cans. The surrounding lanterns cast an EERIE LIGHT on the area. The young crew member plays a soft, SPOOKY tune on his guitar. Betsy is RESTLESS. She GLARES at the guitar player. 
The River Boat and Pirate Ship ENTER the cave. The rushing waterfall THRASHES behind them. The BATTERED and BRUISED River Boat comes to a ROUGH stop. SCREECHING along a far wall. The Pirate Ship sails to a SMOOTH STOP in the middle of the cavern. Armed with guns, knives and swords, the Pirates hurriedly SURROUND the intruding River Boat. They take Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members CAPTIVE. 
KEZURE leaps to the Pirate Ship's deck and quickly UNTIES Clare. Indiana ATTEMPTS to FOLLOW. He PAUSES. Quickly GRABBING A FEW STICKS OF DYNAMITE from the Pirate Ship deck. Kezure begins to LEAD Clare off of the ship. His sword at her THROAT. Indiana CALLS OUT. 
INDIANA Wait... 
Kezure STOPS. He TURNS. Indy WALKS toward Kezure, stopping less than TEN FEET from the Pirate King and Clare. Indy's eyes BURN through Kezure. 
INDIANA Free the girl... (glances to his captive friends) ...and my friends... (lights a match, moves it toward TNT fuses) ...or I blow your hideout here out of the water! 
Kezure LAUGHS. Indiana LIGHTS the dynamite fuses. Kezure STOPS laughing...WORRIED for a moment... Then, the Pirate King breaks into a wide, DEFIANT SMILE. 
KEZURE Good. We will all die. 
A STANDOFF. Indy DIDN'T EXPECT this. He is suddenly FRIGHTENED. PUZZLED. Betsy, Scraggy and Clare STARE at Indy. Waiting for his NEXT MOVE...as the dynamite fuse SLOWLY BURNS. Getting CLOSER...CLOSER...to the TNT. Kezure seems CALM. Perfectly WILLING TO DIE. Indy gets ANOTHER IDEA. He BLURTS it out to Kezure. 
INDIANA We can take you to the Lost City of Sun Wu Kung! 
KEZURE Hah! Better men than you have tried to find the Lost City... They have all failed. (cynical laugh) You are a fool. 
INDIANA (as the TNT fuse burns LOWER...LOWER...) No... You're the fool. You and your friends are hiding out in Sun Wu Kung's Water Curtain Cave...and you don't even know it. 
KEZURE (puzzled, looking around) Huh?... 
Scraggy and Betsy exchange a SHOCKED glance. Clare is also SURPRISED by the news. The TNT fuse nears the end...ready to BLOW AT ANY SECOND... Indiana removes the ANCIENT SCROLL from his pocket. He EXTENDS the scroll to Kezure. 
INDIANA The Sacred Pai-Cho Scroll. 
Kezure GRABS the scroll. Attempting to READ it. Indy INTERRUPTS. 
INDIANA Don't bother. Only WE can translate it. 
Kezure EXAMINES the scroll. PUZZLED by the writing. Indiana and Scraggy exchange a HOPEFUL glanpe. Kezure PAUSES. THINKING. He MUMBLES to himself. 
KEZURE The Lost City... Said to have streets paved in gold...treasures far greater than any mortal man could imagine... 
Kezure PUSHES Clare away. TOWARD Indiana. Clare EMBRACES Indy, as he BLOWS OUT the dynamite fuse. Kezure GROWLS at Indy. 
KEZURE Your pathetic lives will be spared. For now. (scratching his neck) But everything we find in the Lost City...belongs to ME. 
INDIANA Fat chance, Sinbad. It's 50-50. Or you've got no deal. 
KEZURE (vicious smile) It is my way. Or you've got no head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WATER CURTAIN CAVE - THAT NIGHT 
A group of Pirates sit TOGETHER. DRUNK. They SING one of their ancient songs. The GUITAR strumming crew member accompanies them. Indiana and Scraggy sit around a BLAZING FIRE with Kezure and several other Pirates. Indy, wearing his spectacles, TRANSLATES the scrolls with Scraggy. Indiana is PUZZLED. TROUBLED. He LOOKS at Scraggy. 
INDIANA Read that last proverb again... 
SCRAGGY (reads translation) "High tide drowns curiosity, Low tide quenches thirst". 
INDIANA (stands, looking at the surroundings) There's something here...something that could help us... 
Meanwhile, Betsy and Clare work in ANOTHER SECTION of the cave. Clare is doing some ARCHEOLOGICAL WORK, studying the various artifacts and utensils. Betsy ASSISTS her. They are surrounded by LEERING, HUNGRY EYED PIRATES. The drunken Pirates DON'T take their eyes off of the girls. Betsy NOTICES. She POINTS it out to Clare. 
BETSY Look at 'em. It's like they've never seen a woman before. 
CLARE To them... We're the ultimate women. 
BETSY Kinda' flattering, isn't it?... Being the girl of 200 guy's dreams? 
Clare and Betsy exchange a CHUCKLE. 
Meanwhile, Indiana, Scraggy and Kezure WALK through the cavern. Indy is LOOKING around. CURIOUS, he turns to Kezure. 
INDIANA Is there an area... A place where the tide changes?... 
Kezure leads Indiana and Scraggy into a DARK CORNER of the cavern. A large, smooth WALL stretches to the ceiling. The wall is filled with intricate CRACKS. At the base of the wall, water slowly POURS into the cavern. Kezure POINTS to the water. 
KEZURE In a few hours...the water will be lower...much lower... 
INDIANA And the remainder of this wall will be visible?.... 
Kezure NODS. Indiana's eyes LIGHT. A REALIZATION. He excitedly TURNS to Kezure. 
INDIANA We're gonna need light. A lot of light. On this wall. 
Kezure NODS. Indiana EXCHANGES an anxious, hopeful glance with Scraggy. 
A GIANT, METAL TRAP, OVER FOUR FEET HIGH, SHOOTS UP FROM THE GROUND! A HUMAN TRAP! The GUITAR PLAYER DIVES TO SAFETY! The trap's SHARP METAL TEETH SNAP SHUT! The guitar is SNAPPED IN TWO! 
Soon, the path ERUPTS with countless ROWS OF TRAPS. They EJECT from the ground. SNAPPING SHUT. One AFTER the other. Everyone begins to RUN. The traps SNAP SHUT ONLY A FEW FEET BEHIND THEM! Everyone ROUNDS A CORNER... They COME UPON... 
AN ENORMOUS PIT! Over TEN FEET DEEP! Filled with countless layers of SCORPIONS! There is NOWHERE TO TURN. NOWHERE TO RUN. The METAL TRAPS continue to SHUT BEHIND THEM! 
Indiana removes his SWORD. He slices at A BAMBOO TREE. The traps CONTINUE TO SHUT BEHIND HIM. Getting CLOSER. CLOSER. Indiana gives A FINAL WHACK TO THE TREE. It FALLS. STRETCHING across the pool. Only A FEW FEET ABOVE the stinging scorpions. Indiana begins to CLIMB ACROSS. Moving HAND OVER HAND. Everyone hurriedly FOLLOWS. The bamboo tree CREAKS with their every movement. Their feet DANGLE only INCHES above the scorpions. The last Pirate GRABS HOLD of the bamboo tree, just as the FINAL METAL TRAP SHUTS! JUST MISSING HIM! 
As the last Pirate makes his way ACROSS the pit, he DROPS a small bag of GOLD COINS. The coins REST a few feet below. DIRECTLY ON TOP of the scorpions. The Pirate PAUSES. DECIDING whether to climb to safety or retrieve the coins. Everyone else has MADE IT across. The GREEDY Pirate wants his money. With his left hand, he HOLDS TIGHTLY to the bamboo tree. With the other, he REACHES for the coins. His fingers are INCHES from the ciins. But he LOSES his grip. He FALLS. INTO THE PIT. SURROUNDED by hundreds of scorpions. He STRUGGLES to get out. CLIMBING. SWIMMING. But he only manages to SINK. The Pirate's SCREAMS die, as his body is ENGULFED by the stinging scorpions. 
Indiana and the others CONTINUE AHEAD. Moving SLOWLY. CAREFULLY. Someone's foot STEPS ON A WOODEN TRIGGER. There is another CREAKING SOUND. Behind everyone, a large BAMBOO DOOR EJECTS FROM THE GROUND. It leads to an UNDERGROUND CAGE. The door CREAKS OPEN. THREE FEROCIOUS LIONS LEAP OUT! TEETH BARED. GROWLING. They COME FOR the humans. 
Everyone DASHES FORWARD. RUNNING. The lions are in HOT PURSUIT. FAST. The humans don't stand a CHANCE. Suddenly, Clare STOPS. She TURNS. FACING the charging lions. Indiana LOOKS BACK. SCREAMING. 
INDIANA Clare! What are you...?!? 
The lions STOP. Inches from Clare. They SURROUND her. Ready to ATTACK. Indiana WATCHES. PUZZLED. Clare begins to make bizarre PURRING and COOING SOUNDS. The lions PAUSE. They RECOGNIZE the sounds. Clare CONTINUES. The lions begin to WARM UP to her. Clare KNEELS. She PETS the beasts. The lions SNUGGLE up to Clare. LICKING her face. Indiana and the others COME CLOSER. PUZZLED. Clare EXPLAINS. 
CLARE I imitated the sound of a Lion Mother calling her babies. 
Betsy is IMPRESSED. Indiana SMILES. RELIEVED. 
INDIANA C'mon. Let's get outta' -- 
Indy TURNS...FACE TO FACE with a grotesque SHRUNKEN HEAD! He STEPS BACK. The shrunken head is worn around the neck of a tall, muscular TRIBAL CHIEF. Leader of the WARRIORS. Countless NATIVES stand behind the chief. A look of ANGER...HATE...covers the Chief's face. Indiana gives a HOPEFUL glance to Kezure. 
INDIANA Is this the Tribal Chief you told me about?... Your friend?... 
KEZURE (points to shrunken head) No. That is him. 
Indiana ROLLS his eyes. The warriors SURROUND everyone. ARROWS aimed. Ready to KILL. The Warriors lead everyone OUT of the path. 
EXT. MONGOOBO VILLAGE 
Several GRASS HUTS are scattered throughout this large village. Indiana and the others are LED into the village. They PASS the penetrating, unfriendly glares of the villagers. Kezure EXPLAINS to Indiana. 
KEZURE This is a different tribe. New. They have taken over the village. 
INDIANA What happened to the other tribe? 
Kezure SHRUGS. Indiana TURNS to Scraggy. 
INDIANA You recognize their language? 
PAGE 73 MISSING FROM HARD COPY 
Suddenly, a VOICE echoes from inside of the oven. The natives LISTEN. Again, the voice SHOUTS from inside. It's SCRAGGY. The natives RECOGNIZE the language. They quickly OPEN the oven door. Scraggy is SCREAMING in the tribe's tongue. The grille is PULLED out of the oven. The natives hurriedly UNTIE the slightly smoked Indiana, Kezure and Scraggy. 
Scraggy SHOOTS to his feet. FURIOUS. He begins to SHOUT at the tribal CHIEF. The Chief and the villagers are AWESTRUCK by Scraggy's words. The nervous Chief ORDERS Clare, Betsy and the others UNTIED. Scraggy WHISPERS to Indiana. 
SCRAGGY I tell him we divine messengers of Sun Wu-Kung. If he interfere with our mission... Jade Emperor come down from heavens and destroy his village. 
Indy SMILES. Scraggy TURNS and again SHOUTS to the chief. The chief OBEYS Scraggy's every word. He LEADS Indy and Scraggy to another area of the village. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indiana. 
SCRAGGY I tell him we lose path to city... I ask if he have something to help us. 
The chief leads Indy and Scraggy into a LARGE GRASS HUT. 
INT. GRASS HUT 
EMPTY, save for an elaborate MARBLE ALTAR. A dull MIRROR rests on the altar. The small mirror is surrounded by a crude, STONE FRAME. The chief PICKS up the mirror and GIVES it to Scraggy. The chief EXPLAINS. Scraggy GIVES the mirror to Indiana. 
SCRAGGY (translating) He say this will help us. And since we are divine messengers...we will know how to use it! 
Indiana SMIRKS. He EXAMINES the mirror. Totally CONFUSED by it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MONGOOBOO VILLAGE - DAWN 
The village SLEEPS. QUIET. PEACEFUL. Scraggy's Model-T is PARKED here. Several of the crew members and Pirates are SLEEPING in and around the car. KEZURE is sprawled on the car's roof. SNORING. It is obvious that they have CAMPED here for the evening. 
Suddenly, a SLIGHT TREMOR surges through the village. A soft VIBRATION. Cooking utensils RATTLE. Grass huts SHAKE. 
INT. GRASS HUT 
Indiana SLEEPS here. In a HAMMOCK. The vibration WAKES Indy. As he moves to climb out of the hammock, a FIGURE LEAPS ON TOP OF HIM! BETSY. 
BETSY Indy. I'm frightened. 
INDIANA I'm claustrophobic. 
SHOOTS out of the jungle. A METAL MONSTROSITY. ONE of a kind. The tank is over TEN TIMES the size of a normal tank. Nearly 100 FEET LONG. Over 25 FEET HIGH. It is equipped with THREE LEVELS. On the TOP LEVEL, is the tank's swivelling GUN BARREL. ENORMOUS. The size of a CANNON. Two giant, BLAZING RED SWASTIKAS adorn both sides of the tank's SECOND LEVEL. 
The tank RUNS OVER Scraggy's Model-T. The car is FLATTENED. A THICK CLOUD OF DUST erupts from the ground. 
INT. TANK 
GUTTERBUHG is here. He views the outside action through a PERISCOPE. TWO NAZI GUNNERS are behind him. WAITING for orders to shoot. TYKI sits in the background. The confused pygmy is BOUND and GAGGED. 
OUTSIDE 
Scraggy, Clare, Betsy, Kezure and the others DASH across the plains. RUNNING AWAY from the pursuing tank. But Indiana is NOT with them. Scraggy, UNABLE TO SEE through the dust, calls out. 
SCRAGGY Indy?... Indy?... 
Indiana is SEVERAL FEET AWAY. On the GROUND. ALONE. LOST in the thick of DUST. Suddenly, a DARK FIGURE appears. TOWERING over Indiana. The dust begins to CLEAR. Revealing a protruding WHITE HORN. More dust CLEARS. We see that the figure is a large, BLACK RHINOCEROS! Indy LEAPS to his feet. The rhino SNORTS. Indy turns to RUN. The rhino CHASES him! 
Meanwhile, with most of the dust CLEARED, the TANK CHASES INDY'S FRIENDS ACROSS THE JUNGLE PLAINS. 
INT. TANK 
Gutterbuhg LOOKS into the periscope. Indy's friends are in his SIGHTS. Gutterbuhg SCREAMS to the gunners. 
GUTTERBUHG (German; English subtitles) Fire! 
OUTSIDE 
The tank's large barrel FIRES A SHOT at the running group. The blast FLIES OVER THEIR HEADS. JUST MISSING everyone. It BLASTS a row of palm trees to smithereens. 
INDIANA is still running from the rampaging rhino. Indy begins to RUN IN A CIRCLE. The angry rhino FOLLOWS him. The circle begins to TIGHTEN... Becoming SMALLER... SMALLER... Until Indy is nearly running ALONGSIDE of the rhino. At the exact moment, Indy GRABS HOLD of the rhino. He LEAPS onto the beast. With a bit of careful maneuvering, Indiana is RIDING THE RHINOCEROS! 
Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others CONTINUE TO RUN. The tank is right BEHIND THEM. MOVING FAST. In HOT PURSUIT. The tank FIRES ANOTHER SHOT! It SPLATTERS the ground. BESIDE the group. Again, JUST MISSING everyone. The group TURNS. RUNNING in ANOTHER DIRECTION. The tank FOLLOWS. 
Indiana continues to ride the WILD, BUCKING rhino. He has NO CONTROL over the beast. The rhino spots SOMETHING. The TANK. From this angle, the tank, with its large protruding gun barrel, resembles a GIANT RHINOCEROS. Seeing this, the rhino turns and RUNS TOWARD the tank. HEAD ON. Indy holds TIGHTLY. 
Scraggy and the others PAUSE. They see the tank BEHIND THEM. They see the rhino AHEAD of them. The group makes QUICK TURN. To the RIGHT. They run toward a RAVINE. 
The tank is headed STRAIGHT for Indy and the rhino. Both moving at FULL SPEED. 
INT. TANK 
Through the periscope, Gutterbuhg SEES Indy and the rhino. 
INDIANA 
continues to RIDE the uncontrollable rhino. They are within THIRTY FEET of the oncoming tank. 
INT. TANK 
Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi Gunner to "Fire". 
EXT. PLAINS 
The tank FIRES. The blast is LOW. The ground in front of Indy and the rhino EXPLODES. A cloud of dust ERUPTS. 
INT. TANK 
Gutterbuhg LOOKS through the periscope. His view is BLOCKED by dust. 
EXT. PLAINS 
The tank is UPON Indy and the rhino. The rhino SCREECHES to a stop. FRIGHTENED by the blast. Indiana LEAPS ONTO THE TANK. GRIPPING the front section. HOLDING ON for dear life. Moments before he is crushed beneath the tank's giant treads, the RHINO TURNS and RUNS OFF. 
Scraggy, Betsy, Clare, Kezure and the others, have arrived at the foot of a tall, several branched TREE. Located at the side of the RAVINE. Over the ravine's edge, is a SEVERAL HUNDRED FOOT DROP onto jagged rocks. Scraggy begins to CLIMB the tree. 
SCRAGGY Safest place from bad spirits...is in branches of tree. 
The others SHRUG. They have NO CHOICE but to FOLLOW Scraggy up into the branches of the tree. 
Indiana CLIMBS along the side of the monstrous tank. He searches for a PASSAGEWAY inside of the tank. 
INT. TANK 
The Nazis are UNAWARE of Indy's presense on the tank. Gutterbuhg CONTINUES to look through the periscope. The dust begins to CLEAR. He FOCUSES his sights on Indy's friends. LOCATED several feet away. They CLIMB into the TREE. Gutterbuhg SMILES. 
EXT. TANK 
Indy CANNOT FIND a passageway into the tank. He SEES the GUN BARREL. OVERHEAD. It SWIVELS. AIMING toward the tree filled with Indy's friends. Indy GRABS one of the tank's LARGE HEADLIGHTS. He PULLS HARD. SNAPPING OFF the headlight. Indy LEAPS upward. He quickly STUFFS the headlight inside of the barrel opening. 
INT. TANK 
The tree of Indy's friends are in Gutterbuhg's SIGHTS. A PERFECT SHOT. Gutterbuhg SCREAMS in German, ordering the Nazi gunners to SHOOT. They FIRE. But the barrel BACKFIRES! EXPLODING in the face of the two Nazi gunners. It sends them FLYING against the wall. OUT COLD. The cabin fills with SMOKE. Only Gutterbuhg and Tyki REMAIN. A FURIOUS Gutterbuhg PICKS up the radio. He SCREAMS into the microphone. 
INT. TANK 
Indy grabs the RADIO MICROPHONE. He HOLDS it in front of Gutterbuhg. 
INDIANA Call your mommy. 
Gutterbuhg GROWLS. He SPEAKS German into the microphone. The voice of LIEUT. MEPHISTO answers. Echoing over the SPEAKERS. Indy GRABS the microphone. INTERRUPTING. 
INDIANA This is Jones. I've got your tank. (pause) It's all over, pal. You lose. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE-UP: LIEUT. MEPHISTO 
He is ANGRY. UPSET. But he FORCES himself to CALMLY address Indiana. 
MEPHISTO Doctor Jones... You surprise me. For a supposedly intelligent man...you jump to childish conclusions. Remember... You are driving our tank. We can FOLLOW you anywhere. (vehement) You are far from defeating us, my friend. The battle has only just begun. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK. Mephisto is standing beside a long ROW OF TENTS. Housing many TROOPS. Several JEEPS are parked in the background. All mounted with RECOILEST CANNONS. 5 CANVAS TRUCKS are also here. Filled with more TROOPS, CANNONS and AMMUNITION. The Nazis have assembled an ENTIRE ARMY! 
INDIANA 
DROPS the microphone. Suddenly WORRIED. He HURRIES out of the tank. Gutterbuhg stays BEHIND. LAUGHING. 
EXT. PLAINS 
Indiana HURRIES to Tyki and the others. Indy shoots an IMPATIENT glance to Scraggy. 
INDIANA We've got to move. Fast. (points to Tyki) Ask him if he knows the way to the City from here. 
Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The pygmy ANSWERS, pointing OFF SCREEN. Scraggy TRANSLATES for Indiana. 
SCRAGGY He do not know exact place... But it is somewhere over there. 
Indy TURNs to the direction where Scraggy points. Several miles away, we see COUNTLESS ROWS OF MOUNTAINS. Thick layers of CLOUDS surround the mountains. Indiana SIGHS. 
INDIANA A lotta' good that does us... It could take us months...years...to search everyone of those. 
Betsy has an IDEA. She removes the STONE MIRROR from Indiana's pocket. 
BETSY Maybe he knows what to do with this... 
Betsy GIVES the mirror to Tyki. His eyes WIDEN. In AWE. Tyki RECOGNIZES the mirror. He excitedly EXPLAINS to Scraggy, who TRANSLATES for Indiana. 
SCRAGGY It is "Magical Mirror of Sun Wu Kung"... 
INDIANA But whattayou do with it? 
Scraggy ASKS Tyki. The energetic pygmy PLACES the mirror against an upright stone. Tyki ADJUSTS the mirror, until it FACES the distant mountains. Tyki emits a high pitched GIGGLE. POINTING to the mirror. Everyone GATHERS around the mirror. The SOUND TRACK MUSIC SOARS. 
The mirror reflects the CLOUDS above the mountains. But above one SPECIFIC MOUNTAIN, we see the image of a CITY REFLECTED ON THE CLOUDS! 
Indiana TURNS away from the mirror, looking at the SPECIFIC MOONTAIN. But the city is ONLY REFLECTED IN THE MAGICAL MIRROR! Clare SMILES at Indy, quoting Tyki from earlier. 
CLARE "I come from Land Of City On Clouds". 
Indiana NODS. HOPEFUL. ANXIOUS. He looks back to the magical REFLECTION. 
CUT TO: 
THE TANK 
travelling a NARROW PATH. Along the side of a STEEP MOUNTAIN. The tank moves UPWARD. Toward the mountain TOP. The tank JERKS. WOBBLES. It's as if the driver were having TROUBLE with the controls. 
INT. TANK 
Indiana DRIVES. UNFAMILIAR with the controls. The tank is CROWDED with everyone. Betsy and Clare sit BESIDE Indy. Gutterbuhg is DIRECTLY BEHIND HIM. Kezure TEACHES a game to Scraggy. Tyki, the Pirates and the various crew members WATCH. The game appears to be a BIZARRE VERSION of chess. Only the tokens are DRIED INSECTS and LIZARDS. Kezure EXPLAINS. 
KEZURE This is called "Taskipi". Only the bravest play. 
Upon hearing this, Scraggy is even MORE EXCITED TO PLAY. The game BEGINS. 
Indiana is becoming extremely FRUSTRATED by the tank controls. Betsy gives a SERIOUS LOOK to him. 
BETSY I've been talking to Dr. Clarke about our problem. 
INDIANA (struggling with tank) Problem?... Hey... What're you two doin' talkin' behind my back?... 
CLARE Betsy needed help. I obliged. 
INDIANA Since when did you become the female Sigmund Freud? 
INT. TANK 
Indy LOOKS at the tank's control panel. A PUZZLEMENT. He LOOKS at Gutterbuhg. 
INDIANA How do I work the big gun? 
Gutterbuhg SMILES. He REFUSES to answer. Indy has NO TIME for games. He LOOKS at Kezure. 
INDIANA Want your souvenir? (grabs Gutterbuhg's left arm) Start with his good arm. 
Kezure SMILES and removes his LONG KNIFE. He moves it Gutterbuhg's NECK. The snivelling Nazi CRIES OUT. 
GUTTERBUHG W-W-Wait!... Please!... 
Indy NODS to Kezure. The Pirate King moves his KNIFE. Gutterbuhg hurriedly POINTS to two switches on the control panel. 
GUTTERBUHG There. That is what you want. 
Indy NODS. He TURNS to the switches. 
EXT. RAVINE 
CLOSE-UP: The tank's large gun barrel SWIVELS. Pointing UPWARD. To the ROCKS above. The gun FIRES A SHOT. It swivels a FEW FEET. Then FIRES ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. A RUMBLING SOUND echoes through the area. 
INT. TANK 
Indy HITS the gas. 
EXT. RAVINE 
The tank SHOOTS forward. SPEEDING ahead. An AVALANCHE BEGINS! JUST MISSING the tank. Several pounds of ROCKS and DEBRIS fall from above. The rocks create A THICK WALL. BLOCKING the mountain path. 
The tank CONTINUES along the twisting, narrow mountain path. Moving further and further UPWARD. The tank DISAPPEARS INTO THE THICK CLOUDS that surround the mountain. 
INT. TANK 
Indiana LOOKS through the persiscope. His view BLINDED by the clouds. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN 
The tank is a LARGE, GREY BLUR through the clouds. Several DARK, BULKING FIGURES APPEAR! They CLIMB along the ravine sides and tops. The mysterious figures SURROUND the tank. All are holding ENORMOUS BOULDERS over their heads. AIMED at the tank. 
INT. TANK 
Indy EASES up on the gas. The tank SLOWS. Suddenly, there is a LOUD CRASH! The tank is HIT. RATTLING. SHAKING. Everyone is TOSSED. Save for Indy, who STAYS at the controls. He continues to GUIDE the tank FORWARD. There is another CRASH. And ANOTHER. And ANOTHER. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN 
The dark figures SHOWER the tank with heavy boulders. The tank's gun barrel SNAPS IN TWO. Headlights SMASH. Its body becomes DENTED. CRACKED. 
INT. TANK 
Indiana is TOUGH. PERSISTENT. He continues to move the jolting tank FORWARD. As the surrounding walls CAVE IN. SHATTER. Everyone PANICS. SCREAMING. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN 
The injured, wobbling tank moves OUT OF THE CLOUDS. Arriving around the corner from the MOUNTAIN TOP. The countless dark figures continue to FOLLOW the tank. SCURRYING along the ravine sides and tops. The figures EMERGE from the clouds. For the first time, they are VISIBLE. And we see that the figures are TALL... HAIRY... MUSCULAR... GORILLAS! They CONTINUE to assault the tank with boulders. 
INT. TANK 
Indiana still attempts to move the tank FORWARD. But the engine begins to COUGH. SPUTTER. And DIES. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN 
The tank COMES TO A SUDDEN STOP. One of the Gorillas emits a BIGS PITCHED SHRIEK. COMMUNICATING with the others. The others PAUSE. They STOP the attack. The Gorillas APPROACH the tank. SLOWLY. CAUTIOUSLY. The apes REACH OUT. TOUCHING the tank's wrecked body. A few of the apes begin to CLIMB onto the tank. 
The tank's top hatch FLIPS OPEN. Indy's HEAD pops out. TWO HAIRY ARMS REACH INTO FRAME AND GRAB INDIANA! An enormous Gorilla pulls Indy OUT OF THE HATCH! The ape TOSSES INDY OFF SCREEN! 
Indiana FLIES INTO THE AIR! He LANDS IN THE ARMS of another Gorilla. The ape TAKES Indy's WHIP and THROWS him to another Gorilla, who takes Indy's HAT. The Gorilla TOSSES Indy to another ape, who tears off Indy's LEATHER JACKET. The helpless Indy is THROWN to yet another Gorilla. The angry ape RAISES Indy over his head. The Gorilla prepares to THROW INDIANA OFF OF THE MOUNTAIN'S EDGE! 
Tyki's VOICE ERUPTS FROM OFF SCREEN. The Gorilla PAUSES, suspending Indiana HIGH IN THE AIR. The Gorilla TURNS to Tyki. The pygmy STANDS on the tank. He SHOUTS AN ORDER to the Gorilla. The ape NODS. UNDERSTANDING. He KNOWS Tyki. The Gorilla gently PLACES Indy back on the ground. Indiana ADJUSTS what remains of his clothing. He turns, seeing A GROUP OF GORILLAS. HUDDLED together. The Gorillas SEPARATE. They have DRESSED one of the apes in INDIANA'S HAT, LEATHER JACKET AND WHIP! The ape begins to SNAP THE WHIP, almost as if he were IMITATING Indy. 
Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the others have CLIMBED OUT of the tank. Upon seeing the Gorilla DRESSED as Indy, they BURST INTO LAUGHTER. A very ANGRY Indiana growls at Tyki. 
INDIANA (pointing to Gorilla) Tell him to take off my stuff! 
Through laughter, Scraggy TRANSLATES for Tyki. The pygmy SHOUTS an order to the Gorilla. The ape REMOVES the hat and leather jacket, RELUCTANTLY giving them back to a grumbling Indiana. 
Tyki continues to SHOOT orders to the other Gorillas. The pygmy suddenly appears STRONG. AUTHORITATIVE. He obviously has POWER over the beasts. The Gorillas GATHER together. They MOVE TOWARD the people. The apes GENTLY take the hands of the various humans. It is a WARM, ENCHANTING sight, as the friendly Gorillas LEAD the humans forward. Clare, using her Gorilla MOTIONS and SOUNDS, communicates with the beasts. The group moves AROUND A TWISTING CORNER OF THE PATH. Toward the MOUNTAIN TOP. 
AROUND THE CORNER 
Indiana is LED into the Ruler's Chamber. Indy SEES Scraggy, tied to a leash. An angry, VENGEFUL look covers Indy's face. He TURNS to Gutterbuhg. The Nazi, still STUFFING his face with food, pulls TIGHTLY on Scraggy's leash. 
GUTTERBUHG Your friend makes a wonderful interpreter. 
Indy's eyes BURN. Gutterbuhg GULPS down a glass of wine. Liquid SPITTLES from the sides of his mouth. He LOOKS at Indy. 
GUTTERBUHG "The Nazi Party will exist for one thousand years...and I wish to be alive for every year!" (pause) That is a favorite philosophy of our feuher. 
INDIANA Your feuher's philosphies belong on a bathroom wall. 
GUTTERBUHG (angry, slapping Indy across the face) This is a very serious matter, Doctor Jones. It could save your life. (pause) I understand that somewhere in this City...there is a Garden of... Immortal Peaches?... (Indy doesn't respond, Gutterbuhg continues) I want information about this Garden... And I would greatly appreciate it, if you would share everything you know, with me. 
INDIANA I don't share anything with Nazis. 
Gutterbuhg NODS. He TAKES another bite of food, shooting a GLOWERING look to Indiana. 
GUTTERBUHG Very well. My friends will be here soon. They will rest...enjoy the pleasures of my newfound kingdom... (kisses a woman, and pushes her away) Then we shall exterminate these worthless people! Destroy their City! And we will carry away all of its riches...in pieces. 
Gutterbuhg goes back to his FOOD. Scraggy exchanges a WORRIED GLANCE with Indiana. 
CUT TO: 
THE NAZI ARMY 
TRAVELLING along the narrow mountain path. They are more than HALFWAY up the mountain. LIEUT. MEPHISTO rides in the FRONT JEEP. He LOOKS to his driver, who REPORTS to Mephisto. 
DRIVER (German, English subtitles) Sir... We shall reach the mountain top in less than sixty minutes. 
Mephisto NODS. ANXIOUS. 
CUT TO: 
THE LOST CITY - COLISEUM 
An enormous STONE ARENA. Located in the CENTER of the City. It resembles the ROMAN COLISEUM in size and structure. The coliseum's top walls are SURROUNDED by countless, large METAL BELLS. The bells are RINGING. They are the same bells we heard earlier...but they now sound EERIE... THREATENING. The many seats are FILLED with members of the village. All GATHERED for a special event. 
Gutterbuhg sits in the elaborate RULER'S BOX. It is covered with a protective, GOLDEN GRATING. The box is located directly above the earthen PLAYING FIELD. Indy's WHIP is still tied around Scraggy's neck, who kneels at Gutterbuhg's FEET. 
TWO GUARDS lead a shirtless INDIANA JONES onto the playing field. They bring Indy to a STEEL CAGE, located directly below Gutterbuhg's box. Inside of the cage, are TWO ENORMOUS BUFFALO. ANGRY. RESTLESS. 
Betsy, Clare, Tyki, Kezure, the remaining Pirates and Crew members, all helplessly watch from inside of a LARGE METAL CAGE. The cage is SUSPENDED in the air... DANGLING over a deep pit. It is filled with COUNTLESS MANEATING TIGERS. 
Indy is LED into the cage. BETWEEN the two buffalo. The guards GRABS HOLD of Indiana. They TIE one of his arms, and one of his legs, to EACH SIDW of the buffalo. Preparing to DRAW and QUARTER Indiana. 
A DELIGHTED Gutterbuhg PEERS DOWN at Indiana. 
GUTTERBUHG Doctor Jones... Those beasts are anxious to run wild. Free. (vicious smile) How long will you be able to ride... before they TEAR YOU IN TWO? 
Indy LOOKS at Scraggy, who is very FRIGHTENED. 
GUTTERBUHG Goodbye, Doctor Jones. 
Gutterbuhg TURNS to the guards. Ready to give them the ORDER...to OPEN THE CAGE and SET THE BUFFALO FREE! Indy suddenly SCREAMS. 
INDIANA Heil Hitler! 
Upon hearing the words, Gutterbuhg STANDS. Like a ROBOT. He RAISES his mechanical arm in a "Heil Hitler" POSE. 
GUTTERBUHG Heil Hitler! 
The FINGERS of Gutterbuhg's mechanical arm get CAUGHT IN THE METAL GRATING ABOVE HIS HEAD! Gutterbuhg TRIES TO REMOVE his fingers. NO GOOD. STUCK. Gutterbuhg PULLS. HARD. His mechanical arm is RIPPED FROM ITS SOCKET! It DANGLES from the grating. 
The crowd WATCHES. PUZZLED. SHOCKED. 
Scraggy THINKS FAST. He LEAPS to his feet and GRABS the arm. He TEARS IT OUT of the grating. Scraggy HOLDS the arm above his head. Now it is HE who possesses the POWER! The crowd CHEERS Scraggy! Their NEW RULER! 
Gutterbuhg STEPS BACK. Suddenly FRIGHTENED. Scraggy ORDERS the guards to FREE Indiana. The guards hurriedly UNTIE Indy from the buffalo. Gutterbuhg TURNS. RUNNING out of the Coliseum. Scraggy SCREAMS to the people, motioning for them to FOLLOW Gutterbuhg. Several people LEAP from their seats. CHASING the Nazi. 
EXT. COLISEUM 
Gutterbuhg DASHES OUT! A CROWD OF VILLAGERS follow him. In HOT PURSUIT. Gutterbuhg RUNS toward the city gates. He RUNS through. ESCAPING the City. The crowd PAUSES. STOPPING. They'll go NO FURTHER. They SCREAM and SHOUT at the departing Gutterbuhg, who disappears INTO THE MOUNTAINS. 
INT. COLISEUM 
Indiana REJOINS his friends on the playing field. They have been FREED from the cage. Scraggy gives the WHIP to Indy. Indy is IMPATIENT. WORRIED. He LOOKS at everyone. 
INDIANA Nazis'll be be here soon. We gotta move fast. 
Scraggy gives Gutterbuhg's MECAHNICAL ARM to Tyki. The pygmy NODS. He UNDERSTANDS. Tyki RAISES THE ARM TOWARD THE PEOPLE. They CHEER Tyki, their rightful ruler. Tyki, PULLS BACK and THROWS the mechanical arm. HIGH INTO THE AIR! It SOARS several feet! FLYING OVER the coliseum walls. 
EXT. CITY 
A very WEAK Indiana still clutches the bar. He manages to BOOST himself out of the pit. He takes a FEW STEPS. WOBBLING. BLOOD pours from the wound in his chest. He STUMBLES. To his KNEES. His eyes ROLL BACK. He FALLS to the ground. His body is STILL. MOTIONLESS. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TANK 
The Gorillas, still dressed as NAZIS, continue to DRIVE THE TANK FORWARD. 
EXT. TANK 
The tank SPEEDS TOWARD THE ROWS OF CHARGING NAZI TROOPS. The Nazis STOP. SHOCKED to see their own tank coming at them. But the tank continues to BARREL AHEAD. Many of the Nazis are CRUSHED beneath the heavy tank treads. Others DROP their weapons and RUN. FRIGHTENED. 
INT. TANK 
The Gorillas are ECSTATIC. HOWLING. CHEERING. 
CUT TO: 
KEZURE AND THE PIRATES 
They have DEFEATED all of the Nazis. One of the canvas trucks has completely SUNK. Only a small section of the other truck JUTS OUT of the water. The Pirates CLING to the fleeting safety of the sinking truck frame, which is surrounded by several HUNGRY SHARKS. There are even TOO MANY maneaters for the powerful Kezure to handle. As the frame continues to SINK...the Pirates' feet get CLOSER...CLOSER...to the snapping sharks... 
Suddenly, a ROPE DROPS FROM OVERHEAD! Kezure LOOKS UP. SCRAGGY and his crew members stand on the DRAWBRIDGE. They have DROPPED the line. Kezure and the Pirates CLIMB upward. To SAFETY. 
On the drawbridge, Scraggy ASSISTS Kezure. Scraggy SMILES, repeating Kezure's earlier threat. 
SCRAGGY You owe me, old man. 
Kezure LAUGHS. He EMBRACES Scraggy. They are joined by TYKI and the OTHER PYGMIES. A sudden CALM...a sudden SILENCE...overcomes the city. The battle has ENDED. The Nazis have been DEFEATED. The city is SAVED. But Tyki is SOLEMN. DISTRESSED. He STARES OFF SCREEN. CAMERA PANS TO HIS P.O.V. We see the countless BODIES OF PYGMIES. SPRAWLED on the ground. DEAD. The price you pay for FREEDOM. Suddenly, the silence is INTERRUPTED. Someone is CRYING. It is BETSY. 
Scraggy looks OFF SCREEN, to the direction of the sounds. The color LEAVES his face. 
SCRAGGY'S P.O.V. 
A group of pygmies CARRY the limp body of Indiana Jones out of the coliseum. They GENTLY LOWER Indy's body to the ground. Clare and Betsy KNEEL beside Indy. TEARS run down Betsy's face. 
Scraggy suddenly BREAKS AWAY from the crowd. CAMERA DOLLIES WITH HIM as he runs toward Indy. Scraggy STOPS at Indy's body. Clare, eyes FILLED with tears NODS to Scraggy. She can BARELY utter the words... 
CLARE He's...dead... 
TEARS erupt in Scraggy's eyes. He breaks down CRYING. A startled KEZURE joins the others. CAMERA PULLS BACK to an extremely LONG SHOT. The entire village GATHERS around Indiana's body. Everyone is SOLEMN. SILENT. 
A SLOW DISSOLVE: 
CLOSE-UP: INDIANA'S BODY. 
It is LYING in state. Resting on a BAMBOO STRETCHER. It is covered with EXOTIC, COLORFUL FLOWERS. CAMERA PULLS BACK. Indy is being carried by several, elaborately dressed PYGMIES. At the head of a long 
FUNERAL PROCESSION. Betsy, Clare, Scraggy and Kezure MARCH beside Indy's body. They also wear the ceremonial FUNERAL FLOWERS. Behind them, the body of BOHBALA is being carried. And behind the ruler, the bodies of all DEAD PYGMIES are being carried by the remaining VILLAGERS and GORILLAS. It is NIGHTIME. All mourners are carrying FLICKERING CANDLES. At the rear of the procession, a lone pygmy strums an UNUSUAL STRING INSTRUMENT. This creates a HAUNTING melody. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO A LONG SHOT, as we see the procession move through the city. The hundreds of flickering candles against the dark night sky create a BEAUTIFUL IMAGE. The procession arrives at a large STONE WALL. It appears to be a DEAD END. Tyki WALKS to the wall. 
He FALLS to his knees and begins to CHANT. Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and Kezure WATCH. There is a SMALL RUMBLE. A hairline CRACK begins to form in the mountain. As if it were being DRAWN by an invisible hand, the crack forms a LARGE DOOR in the wall. The door slowly OPENS. An almost BLINDING WHlTE LIGHT emanates from inside. Tyki ENTERS. The procession FOLLOWS. 
INT. WALL 
The procession ascends a TWISTING STONE STAIRCASE, that spirals upward, where the light becomes BRIGHTER... BRIGHTER... At the stairway top, there is ANOTHER DOORWAY. Tyki and the others ENTER. Indiana's body is CARRIED through. 
THE GARDEN OF IMMORTAL PEACHES! 
A breathtakingly beautiful forest of never ending luscious green trees, filled with succulent, ripe PEACHES. We have never seen COLORS like this. So MAGICAL...so INTENSE... Bright SUNLIGHT shines from a vivid blue sky. There is always a RAINBOW here. The procession ENTERS. Scraggy, Clare, Betsy and Kezure stare in total WONDERMENT. Betsy is PUZZLED by the bright sunlight. 
BETSY But... It's... It's the middle of the night... 
Tyki WHISPERS to Scraggy, who explains to Betsy. 
SCRAGGY Sun always shine in the Garden of Immortal Peaches. 
Clare NODS. Kezure is MESMERIZED by the peach trees. His mouth HANGS OPEN. He TURNS to Scraggy. 
KEZURE These are the peaches that make one ...forever young?... 
Scraggy NODS. Tyki LEADS the procession to a clearing in the garden. Many freshly dug GRAVES are here. All of the bodies are carried to SEPARATE GRAVES, including Indiana And Bohbala. 
A few feet ahead of the graves, rests the LARGEST PEACH TREE in the forest. It is much WIDER and TALLER than the others. There is a small, glass encased TOMB built into the tree. Inside of the tomb, is a TINY SKELETON. No more than FOUR FEET TALL. The skeleton is adorned with a LION SKINNED ROBE and golden CROWN. In its hand, the skeleton clutches the famous GOLDEN HOOPED ROD, a glorious, elaborate STAFF. An ancient inscription is ETCHED IN STONE over the tomb. Pointing to the inscription, Clare TURNS to Scraggy. 
CLARE What does it say?... 
SCRAGGY (translating) "Our Lord... Our Master... Sun... Wu... Kung" 
THE SOUND TRACK MUSIC RISES. It is the tomb of the STONE MONKEY KING. Clare exchanges an AWE INSPIRED glance with Betsy, then looks to the still body of Indiana. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CITY GATES - THE FOLLOWING MORNING 
Indiana, Clare, Betsy, Scraggy, Kezure, the Pirates and Crew members, have GATHERED outside of the city walls for the journey home. They are saying "Goodbye" to TYKI, BOHBALA And the other PYGMIES. 
Clare and Tyki exchange a TEARFUL FAREWELL, communicating in hand signals. They share a final EMBRACE. Bohbala again THANKS Indiana for his help. Betsy says "Goodbye" to the many GORILLAS. Betsy COMMUNICATES in Gorilla hand motions and growls. 
Indiana, holding the Golden Hooped Rod, TURNS and moves across the drawbridge. The others FOLLOW. The entire city of pygmies and Gorillas CHEER for their departing friends. Indy and the others DISAPPEAR into the clouds, walking down the MOUNTAIN PATH. The Lost city GLISTENS in the background. The drawbridge CLOSES...until the next visitor ARRIVES. 
DISSOLVE T0: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN PATH - A FEW HOURS LATER 
Early AFTERNOON. The sun is HOT. SCORCHING. Indy and his party REST. They NAP in a shady section of the path. CAMERA PANS THE SNOOZING BODIES of everyone, coming to a STOP at Indiana. The Golden Hooped Rod RESTS beside Indy. A HAND COMES INTO FRAME and GRABS the staff. OTHER HANDS MOVE INTO FRAME. They STEAL Indy's WHIP and REVOLVER. They TAKE all weapons from Scraggy and his crew members. 
Indiana is awakened by a SWORD. At his THROAT. Indy REACHES for his gun and whip...GONE. He LOOKS UP. KEZURE stands over him, holding the sword in one hand, the GOLDEN ROD in another. Indy TURNS. The other Pirates hold SWORDS and DAGGERS at the throats of Clare, Betsy, Scraggy and the crew members. Kezure TWIRLS the golden hooped rod in front of him. He SMILES at Indiana. 
KEZURE She is a wonderful treasure... Eh?... 
INDIANA We had a deal. 
KEZURE (moves sword closer to Indy's throat) I have no deals with dead men. 
INDIANA Son of a bitch. 
Kezure LAUGHS. He has REMOVED a peach from his pocket. He SHINES the peach on his cloak, and gives a SHRUG to Indiana. 
KEZURE (shrugs, laughs) I am an old Pirate, Doctor Jones. Do you suddenly expect me to treat you with kindness and fairness?... It is not my way of life! 
Indy is DISGUSTED. Kezure TAKES A LARGE BITE from the peach. As he chews and swallows, Kezure NODS to his men, motioning toward Indy and the others. 
KEZURE Kill them... (takes another bite of the peach) But save their hair. I will make a coat out of it. 
The men MOVE to kill Scraggy, Betsy, Clare and the crew members. Suddenly, Kezure emits a LOUD SCREAM. He GRABS his stomach in pain. He FALLS to his knees. The HALF EATEN PEACH rolls from his hand. Onto the GROUND. 
Indy and Clare RUSH TOWARD Kezure. Something very STRANGE is happening to the Pirate King... His hair begins to FALL OUT. His teeth ROT. His skin SHRIVELS. His body becomes THINNER. SPINDLY. Kezure has begun to RAPIDLY AGE. He continues to SCREAM. In horrible PAIN. 
The Pirates STEP AWAY. FRIGHTENED. The others WATCH IN HORROR. 
Kezure's body CONTORTS. His skin WITHERS... FLAKES... It begins to PEEL from his bones. His screams FADE... His eyeballs ROLL OUT of their sockets. Only his skeleton REMAINS. It turns BLACK and CRUMBLES TO DUST. Only his elaborate clothing REMAINS. The many stolen peaches ROLL OUT of his cloak, onto the ground. 
The remaining Pirates DROP THEIR WEAPONS. They RUN OFF down the mountain. SCARED to death! 
Indiana HOLDS the half eaten peach in his hand. Betsy is PUZZLED. 
BETSY I thought the peaches promised immortality...eternal youth?... 
INDIANA The garden of immortal peaches promises life only to those who are pure in heart. (pause) Kezure was evil. His heart was filled with greed. 
Indiana DROPS the peach to the ground. He grabs his WHIP, REVOLVER and GOLDEN HOOPED ROD. Scraggy and his crew members RETRIEVE their weapons. Everyone TURNS, CONTINUING down the mountain path. LEAVING Kezure's clothes and the several peaches behind. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MOZAMBIQUE - DOCK - A FEW DAYS LATER 
Passengers board a large OCEAN LINER, bound for the United States. INDIANA JONES is here. Bags PACKED. He holds a rectangular wooden crate, covered with the words "FRAGILE". The Golden Hooped Rod is obviously STORED inside. Indy is WAITING for someone. He impatiently CHECKS his wristwach. LOOKING around. He GRUMBLES to himself. 
INDIANA Where's Betsy?... The boat leaves in five minutes... 
Suddenly, a HORN interrupts. Indy turns to the DIRECTION OF THE SOUND. It is SCRAGGY. He is wearing DRIVING GOGGLES. He rides a battered, bruised MOTORCYCLE, attached to a ricketty SIDECAR. The word "TAXI" is painted on the sidecar's exterior. Scraggy PULLS UP beside Indiana. Scraggy JUMPS OFF the motorcycle. Excitedly, he RUNS toward Indy. 
SCRAGGY Oh, Indy! Indy! I want to give you something for your journey! 
Scraggy FUMBLES through his pockets. He removes a small bottle of PURPLE LIQUID. He HOLDS it out to Indy. 
SCRAGGY Take one drink before bed. It keep out all bad spirits. 
Indy DECLINES. He flashes a FLASK OF WHISKEY from inside of his coat pocket. 
INDIANA Thanks, Scraggy... 
But this'll keep out all the bad spirits. Scraggy SHRUGS. They are suddenly INTERRUPTED. 
BETSY (O.S.) Indy!... 
Indiana TURNS. BETSY and CLARE walk toward him. Indy LOOKS at Betsy. PUZZLED. 
INDIANA Where're your bags? 
BETSY I'm not leaving.

1   INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY                                      1 
WE MEET: MUMBLES(late 30s) and ONE TWO (late 30s). They are listening to a sales pitch from two REAL ESTATE AGENTS. 
We SEE all the relevant pictures of their pitch explaining a changing city, LONDON. 
SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.) Two years ago this property cost one million pounds. (we SEE building) Today, it costs five million. 
The camera WHIP PANS over to another part of the building to see the other ESTATE AGENT giving his pitch. The camera will keep this back and forth for the duration of the scene. OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT (V.O.) How did this happen? (CUT TO relevant pictures as he speaks) Attractive tax opportunities for foreign investment, restrictive building consent and massive hedge fund bonuses,... (beat) London, my good man, is fast becoming the financial and cultural capital of the world. 
SLICK ESTATE AGENT And of course the Russians have come to town. 
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT Makes it hard to compete with an ex- Soviet oligarch that has six billion dollars in his back pocket. They don't haggle the price, they double the price. 
SLICK ESTATE AGENT Russians come, prices rise, and it doesn't stop. It only goes one way. 
OTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT Up. 
SLICK ESTATE AGENT I can't teach you how to skin a cat, but I can tell you a lot about the money in bricks and mortar. (MORE)

One Two and Mumbles look at one another.

CUT TO a modern looking LAWYER'S office.   We SEE the LAWYER advising MUMBLES AND ONE TWO. 
LAWYER TYPE They say it's only going one way. 
3   EXT. STREET - DAY                                                3 
ONE TWO and the LAWYER are here looking at the building, it is a bit dilapidated and bleak. 
LAWYER TYPE It looks like a great deal. 
4   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE                                             4 
We cut back into the office where the LAWYER lays out the building plans. 
LAWYER TYPE These are the plans,...it costs ten and it'll be worth twenty with planning. But first you gotta give the councilor a drink. 
5   INT. COUNCILOR'S OFFICE                                          5 
CUT TO the desk of a COUNCILOR (mid thirties middle management)who is receiving a brown envelope from the LAWYER. 
COUNCILOR (off the envelope) Tell them they'll get the planning,... 
6   INT. LAWYER'S OFFICE                                             6 
We CUT BACK to our LAWYER now smug.    One Two and Mumbles are standing in front of him. 
LAWYER TYPE You'll get the planning. Take care of the councilor and it will move like shit through a goose.

CLOSE UP on the back of URI (Russian Jew, 40s, slick, and well groomed, he is our Mr. Blue Eyes) overlooking his sports arena. We stay on the back of Uri's head while he is talking to Lenny. 
URI Glad you could join us here Lenny. 
LENNY COLE It's nice to see you Uri. 
URI Good. (there is a pause) I can see we are very much alike you and I Lenny. We like to get things done. (beat) What's it going to cost me? 
LENNY COLE First, let me make clear how much we can help you benefit from this deal. With out me, it will take you five to ten years to get the permission to erect your arena. (beat) Second, with Government policy as it so stands we both know it's unlikely that you'd ever get that consent. (beat) Thirdly, in legal fees, transactions and building consent, you'd be paying 6 to 12 million without any real guarantee of that result. 
We CUT TO Uri unfazed, he just wants the figure.

LENNY COLE Seven million Euros. 
Still unfazed. 
URI I expect a guarantee that I have consent within six months and no red tape. 
LENNY COLE That's right Uri, you can consider that done. 
Pause while tension stews, then,... 
URI Drink!     Follow me. 16   INT. SPORTS ARENA - PRIVATE BAR                                 16 
Uri walks to the bar. Lenny follows trying to contain his excitement, he's out of his league, a "welcome to the billionaires club" look has struck him pink. Lenny passes a PICTURE that's sat on an EASEL. 
LENNY COLE Oh, that's a nice picture Uri, hasn't it got, errrh depth? 
Uri is at the bar now. He has placed one large tumbler down and is pouring a very very large measure out. 
URI That picture has brought me nothing but luck Lenny,..it's my lucky picture. (he has a good idea) You like? Take it for a while, maybe it will give you luck. 
LENNY COLE Oh I couldn't Uri,... 
Still absorbed with the painting. 
URI Now we're partners, I insist. I will get it sent around to your house and you can give it back to me when our deal is finalized. 
Lenny looks at the bar. Uri motions, there is a SMALL KEG of WHISKEY on the bar and only one large glass.

HANDSOME BOB What are you talking about Fred? They got an informer, a grass, and a rat with a roach-smoking-a canary,..they've got more information than the fuckin Internet. 
DOLLY Language,... 
FRED THE HEAD Well, like I said, nothing. 
MUMBLES Leave him alone Fred, you're stressing him out. Dolly get him a cuppa tea. (beat) Come on deal the cards Fred.

MALCOLM (CONT'D) I must apologize for my assistants handicaps. He has unusually long arms and an alarmingly small neck. (beat, the crowd is unimpressed) Now, I do agree it doesn't seem like the right time to acquire a coat of such thermal efficiency. However, I have been informed that we are looking at a very white winter. PLUS gentlemen and fine lady,.. (He winks at Dolly who has got him a very large glass of water) Christmas is always round the corner. He downs the water without it touching the sides.

Everyone starts tucking their money into their pockets. Fred makes his way back to the table. He speaks to Malcolm and Paul.

Lenny walks into the warehouse where we see TWO SLOANES (posh kids, 20s) strapped to a pair of chairs with weights on the bottom. There are large leather belts wrapped around them. 
LENNY COLE Right, I am going to tell you how this works. You're going in the drink and I am going to make a cup of tea. 
Archy grabs a hook attached to an electric winch and attaches it to their leather belts. 
LENNY COLE (CONT'D) Underneath the floor boards is the famous river Thames. I hope for your sakes you can hold your breath for as long as it takes to boil that kettle. After that, I am going to ask you a question, one question. You are going to give me a name and if it's the right name, I send you home warm and dry in a fresh set of clothes. If it's the wrong name, you'll be fed to the cray fish,....see ya. 
He presses the green button and a hatch in the floor opens. The TWO SLOANES are lowered into the river protesting.

Johnny helps himself to some WASTERS drink at the bar for a quick refreshment. Understandably, the WASTER doesn't look happy and his three FRIENDS don't look happy either. 
WASTER That's my drink. 
Johnny gives the WASTER and his FRIENDS the masturbation signal without even bothering to look at them. 
PETE Fuck you singalong, you're no help and stop calling me Pedro. 
The WASTER grabs a bottle from the bar ready to take some action. Johnny grabs a pencil from his top pocket, he holds it out like it's a knife. It's almost a joke. 
JOHNNY STORY Come on boy, I'll have you and ya girlfriends! I'll do the lot of yazz. 
The WASTER is lost. Johnny is not physically scary, he's only scary because he's quite clearly mad. He looks like Robert Deniro in Taxi driver, mad as mars, he catches himself in the mirror, he likes what he sees. Ciggy falling out of his mouth, he sort of takes the piss out of himself, smiles "tough Johnny," the WASTER backs off he doesn't want junkie madness.

One Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1. As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the car by CHECHNYAN 2. 
ONE TWO The bastard's still kicking.     Mace him, mace him! 
Mumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays mace everywhere, including into One Two's eyes. 
ONE TWO (CONT'D) Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not me you idiot, the Guerrilla! 
CHECHNYAN 2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength and is still pulling One Two into the car with him. We can SEE Bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car looking concerned. 
ONE TWO (CONT'D) Shoot him, shoot him, the bastards going to eat me! Mumbles pulls out a revolver, sticks it in the window and fires it into CHECHNYAN 2's leg. This just aggravates the CHECHNYAN.

ONE TWO (CONT'D) In his arms! 
Bang. 
ONE TWO (CONT'D) Arhhhhhhhhhhh.     That's my fuckin arm! 
One Two manages to head butt CHECHNYAN 2 and goes back to reclaiming the case from CHECHNYAN 1. He pulls it out and Mumbles cuts the chain. One Two can't see a thing. 
HANDSOME BOB (CONT'D) Abandon ship!

One Two gets caught in a head lock by CHECHNYAN 2, they struggle. Mumbles hits the CHECHNYAN from behind with a car Jack and CHECHNYAN 2 goes down again. One Two's eyes have just about come back. ONE TWO Run!     Run for your lives. 
The crew split in DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. Bob takes the cases and plucks some poor bystander out of their car and takes off. Mumbles disappears another way. CHECHNYAN 2 is up and follows One Two - terminator style, a foot chase begins. One Two, split from the group and being pursued, jumps over a wall.

One Two has ended up on a railway track. He turns back, why should CHECHNYAN 2 chase him, he hasn't got the money. But no, CHECHNYAN 2 is over the fence, bullet proof vest flapping in the wind, and coming after him. One Two finds his strength this is his world, the world of the runner - he's off down the tracks.

The pair of them are bleeding profusely, they're bashed to a pulp, but they have still got a running sprit. The run goes on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2 is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming. 
One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "Oh shit." This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play. He drifts in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and runs and runs. Up, down, through and in.

We see Mumbles has caught up with One Two along side the tracks. He is on a motorbike that he has stolen.

One Two jumps on the back and they speed away leaving our Chechnyan's behind.

There is a slight silence as his appearance arrests conversations. Handsome waits near the entrance and One Two sits down across from Stella, there is a pause. The odd PERSON passes and double takes at One Two.

Archy tries the handle, it turns, he pushes the door open slowly. The music becomes clear as we reveal a horrible scene. Archy is shocked, but a little amused. 
Tied to the bed, back to front with a pillow over his head is One Two. A large blade is resting on his back, a bottle of vodka is open on the side, One Two cries and wriggles uselessly.

He is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from his military hat. He is "having much fun." His massive frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two previously inflicted. The other Chechnyan (similarly dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all sorts of horrible looking things. Archy looks on amazed by the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused. He hits the "off" button, the Chechnyans spin, looking distressed. Silence ensues.

DANNY Put him down Arch, he's only little. 
Archy drops him, his wires crossed.        He needs a little time to think. 
Johnny is off out of the elevator walking away happy as a clam. Back to Archy in the elevator. 
DANNY (CONT'D) You all right?     You look a little green. 
ARCHY (back to business) Fine, roll out the carpets. 
135   INT. WAREHOUSE                                                      135 Johnny comes bowling in like a 'rocknrolla' coming on to stage. He spots Lenny. 
JOHNNY STORY Sidney!   Nice wheels. 
Archy comes in with Danny and the carpets, Handsome Bob hears this, is Lenny Cole the Sidney Shaw? 
JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D) Sorry about the painting, needed the cash for a little bit of the old "dusty show bizzzzzzzz." (beat) So, it's gone now, lost in the world of degenerate and stoned no hopers, never to be seen again by the eye of a clean soul. 
There is a pause while Lenny considers just shooting him. He changes his tone, he gets serious and slow. 
LENNY COLE Tell me, what are you boy if you are not poison? Look what you've left behind you. Your Dad couldn't even bear the sight ya, no wonder he fucked off and left me to pick up the pieces, but that wasn't enough for you was it? No, had to drive your mum into a bottle of pills and house full of nutters. All she got then was a hot bath a ice cold razor, why? (beat) Cos your poison Johnny, that's why. (CONTINUED)

JOHNNY STORY What can I say,... (pause) I'm a junkie, crack head, no gooder, should never have wasted your money on that school. 
LENNY COLE Archy get him out of here. 
ARCHY I've had enough of him, I don't trust myself. (beat) Use someone else. 
Johnny grabs the back of Lenny's chair and pushes him around like he's a two year old, Lenny feels a right twit. One Two, Handsome Bob, and Mumbles observe. 
JOHNNY STORY It's a gathering, I love a gathering look, Mumbles, One Two, Handsome Bob all the old faces today. (beat) It's all going so well apart from Archy who's ruining the day. I tried to cheer him up with that story about how you grassed him u,... 
BANG! Lenny shoots Johnny in the hip with a gun he has kept hidden. Everybody is shocked, Danny jumps back in horror that was pretty close. 
ROMAN Whooooa,... 
ARCHY All right calm down, give me that, I'll take care of him. 
Danny moves in to take the gun from Lenny.    Johnny speaks in pain, but still chipper. 
JOHNNY STORY That wasn't one of your better shots was it now Daddy. If you want to shut me up it should have been a bit higher. 
Lenny looks up to Danny.

Back to our acted out scene. 
JUDGE A sort of, "get out of jail free" card, but this comes along with the trail of a good alibi. 
142   INT. WAREHOUSE                                                   142

143   INT. COURT ROOM                                                  143 Still being acted out, in Law and Order style. 
LAWYER The only evidence that will ever remain of this deal is that form of a very exclusive and hard to come by legal document called a "secret debt"... 
144   INT. WAREHOUSE                                                   144 
Back to our present scene. 
ARCHY As in deputation,... (beat) The likes of which I hold for the very first time in my hand. (beat) Of course they use a false name and I have seen that name many times in the last twenty years, always did wonder who Sidney Shaw was,...

LENNY COLE No, I am being set up. 
ARCHY You're a dirty bastard Sidney, a very dirty bastard. 
Archy grabs the belt that's used to tie up drowning victims, he throws it round Lenny's chair and stuffs a bit of cloth into Lenny's wide open mouth. 
ARCHY (CONT'D) (to One Two, Handsome Bob and Mumbles) You three, cut yourself free and get out of here,... 
Archy throws a knife across to Mumbles who just catches it and starts to cut his way out of the ropes. Archy gets back on with the job at hand. He reads through the names Lenny has grassed on over the years. 
ARCHY (CONT'D) Michael Finny, ten years. Frazier Nash, fifteen years. Cousin Ronnie, six years,..you dirty bastard. (beat) Michael Dexter, eight years. 
Archy grabs the winch that lowers victims to their crayfish death and bangs it on to the back of the wheel chair. He presses the start button and the wheelchair is raised with haste. 
ARCHY (CONT'D) The Jew twins, fourteen years and of course ME, Archy, four years. 
One Two, Mumbles, and Handsome Bob are free. 
ONE TWO See ya Arch,.... 
The three of them are out like rats up ropes, they start to run down the stairs.

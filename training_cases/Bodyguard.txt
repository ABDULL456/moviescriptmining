SCREEN IS BLACK In the darkness we hear dripping water, the echoing approach of two sets of footsteps. There is the sound of a sudden, quick scuffle, a heavy fall of bodies. THREE BOOMING GUNSHOTS. Two from one gun, one from another. So fast and close, they're barely distinguish- able. The sound of the SHOTS ECHOES against concrete walls and dies away. Silence. SLOW, SLOW, FADE IN: 
1   INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE (NEW YORK) - NIGHT                   1 
FRANK FARMER'S FACE - mid to late 30s, peers intently over a smoking gun.     He is The Bodyguard. ANGLE - HIT MAN dead on his  feet, leans against a car. A gun drops heavily from  his hand. His life ebbs as he slides slowly down the car  door to his knees then falls forward, face down on the  cement floor. A SLOW PULL BACK reveals that FRANK is lying on top of KLINGMAN. Protectively pressed body to body on the filthy cement floor of the garage. Klingman, a handsome, 50-year-old arbitrageur, gasps in barely controlled fear as his Armani suit soaks up a black pool of oil. There is no movement. The two men are lying near the right front fender of a black limousine. Blood spreads from the body of the hit man, a few yards away. Klingman starts to raise himself up but Farmer keeps him pressed to the floor, still alert for any further threat. MAIN TITLES BEGIN. A beat, and VOICES are heard O.S.   Farmer wheels, snub- nosed .357 aimed at them. FRANK Freeze! ANGLE - DOORWAY TO GARAGE A uniformed chauffeur freezes in his tracks.   Farmer lowers his weapon and speaks. FRANK (calm, but an order) Call 911. 
CAMERA has CRANED UP TO a high, almost-frozen WIDE SHOT of the scene. It TRACKS AWAY INTO darkness. 
2    EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT                                   2 
Passing traffic reveals the storefront of a TV showroom. Inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all the TV sets are showing the same picture, the glittering image of a woman singing. (We will recognize the woman as Rachel Marron.) We cut tighter and tighter on the image until it is almost broken up into its scanning lines. Through the city noise comes the sound of her song "I have Nothing." 
2A   INT. DAN'S APARTMENT - DESK TOP - NIGHT                    2A A battered old desk.  Scattered across the top -- a pile of blank white paper, a jar of glue, a stack of magazines, a pair of scissors, a TV remote control, softly in the b.g., a TV is playing the same image we saw in the store window, the same song. Hands appear. Male hands. They open a drawer and remove a pair of translucent rubber gloves. Carefully they put the gloves on. The SNAPPING of the rubber is the only sound. The hands pick a magazine off the stack: Screen Stars. They put the magazine down and pick up the scissors. A headline on the cover reads: "RACHEL MARRON'S GREATEST TRIUMPH!" The scissors start to cut. Meticulously they excise the name "RACHEL MARRON" from the page. With the care of a surgeon. 
DEVANEY (defeated) Yes.    She collects dolls. FRANK I thought I knew who she was. Devaney tries to size up whether Frank is kidding him or not. Frank's face betrays nothing. Devaney gestures with a knife. DEVANEY You're probably deadly with these things, aren't you? FRANK Deadly. DEVANEY Show me. Frank doesn't move. DEVANEY Why are you resisting this job? $2,000 bucks a week. (no response) FRANK There are several good men available for that kind of money. Have you talked to Fitzgerald or Racine? Portman? DEVANEY Yeah.   Portman was interested... He senses an opening and sits down beside Frank for what he takes to be the first serious talk. DEVANEY ... but we're told you're the best. FRANK There's no such thing. DEVANEY Farmer, we're talking about a very frightened lady. With a 
seven-year old son. Believe me, I wouldn't be here if I didn't think this was for real. (long pause) Farmer, she begged me to get you. Frank sits up finally and looks at Devaney a long time. He picks up five throwing knives and stands up. FRANK All right. I'll come and I'll look the situation over. If I take it, it's three thousand a week. DEVANEY (whistles) Okay. You must be very deadly for three grand a week. Frank is now about twenty feet from the wooden post.     He throws one of the knives. It misses the post and clatters against the fence. FRANK Shit. Devaney's face drops.   Frank examines the next knife. FRANK (mumbling) I know it's something like... The second knife gets away from him at the top of his arc and disappears into some bushes about three feet from Devaney. Devaney stands up in a hurry and moves behind Frank. FRANK Sorry. Frank raises his hand to throw again, then stops and motions Devaney off to the side. FRANK Better not stand right behind me. Devaney smiles weakly. Frank lets the third knife go with one smooth motion. The knife sinks an inch into the center of the post.     THUMP. Frank's hand arching again.     Throwing the remaining knives. Both knives stick in the post forming a straight vertical line with the first one. 
13   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - WAVERLY LANE (BEL AIR) - DAY          13 Frank stops his nondescript Chevy across the quiet street from the closed, unmanned gate at the bottom of the Marron driveway. FRANK'S POV 
as he looks over the gate, the wall, the heavy vegetation and the rising grounds beyond. (NOTE: The use of the term FRANK'S POV, is not to be taken simply as a camera direction. Rather, it re- presents a recurring attempt to make the audience see in the special way Frank sees. Frank lives by constant vigilance, heightened awareness. It is his genius and his burden. The audience must be put in the position of looking, searching, scanning with him.) He has a curious sense of being watched, a kind of prick- ling on the back of his neck. As he looks around, a black Toyota 4X4, parked some way down the road, drives rapidly off -- too fast to get a clear look. He watches it go. Frank pulls up   to the gate and gets out of his car. He grabs a bar of   the gate and pulls. The whole gate rattles. Frank    gets back in his car and pushes a button on the intercom   box at the side of the gate. A MAN'S VOICE CRACKLES   out of the BOX. Transmission is terrible. MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) Yes? FRANK Frank Farmer to see Miss Marron. MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) What? FRANK Alexander Graham Bell to see Miss Marron! MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) (obviously has not heard) Have you got an appointment? FRANK The atomic number of zinc is 30. MAN'S VOICE (V.O.) All right. There is a LOUD BUZZING and the gate swings arthritically open. 
14   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                        14 FRANK'S POV as he moves up the winding drive through heavily land- scaped grounds. Plenty of potential hiding places. The mansion is at the top of the hill. The grounds behind the mansion fall away. 
15   EXT. MANSION - CIRCULAR DRIVE/ENTRANCE AREA - DAY          15 The mansion is huge. On and on it goes. Frank drives PAST the garage area where HENRY, the chauffeur, is polishing the mascot on the limousine. One of his arms is bandaged. Henry peers at Frank, puts down his cloth and walks toward the entrance where Frank is parking. Frank gets out, looks around. A painter's truck is parked nearby, two painters unloading equipment from it. HENRY Can I help you? FRANK Are you the man on the intercom? HENRY No.   Can I help you? FRANK My name is Edison. I have an appointment with Miss Marron. HENRY Oh.   And that was arranged by...? FRANK (impressed) Mr. Devaney. HENRY Go right ahead, Mr. Edison. FRANK What happened to your arm? HENRY (looking at his arm) A doll. He goes back to the limousine. Frank RINGS the DOORBELL, although the door is not shut. EMMA, a fiftyish housekeeper, appears. A man in cover- alls comes out past her, carrying a length of timber. 
FRANK Henry Ford, to see Mr. Devaney. EMMA Come in, please. 
16   INT. MARRON MANSION - DAY                                  16 Frank steps into the foyer with Emma. She is a warm, matronly woman who does a fine job running the house without standing on custom. EMMA I'll tell you quite honestly, Mr. Ford, I don't know where Mr. Devaney is. Did he say he'd be here? FRANK Yes. EMMA Then he probably is.   Let me look. She leads Frank into a large, unused formal parlor. There are dustsheets over the furniture and the walls are being repainted. On a number of TV screens scattered around, Rachel's latest video (the one we saw in the opening titles) is continuously playing. The sound of the song itself -- "I HAVE NOTHING" -- comes softly from concealed speakers. EMMA Please make yourself at home. Can I get you anything? Frank demurs and Emma disappears back through the foyer. Frank watches her go, then moves off into the house in the opposite direction. It's obviously undergoing a major redecoration. Painters, decorators and designers come and go, oblivious to Frank's presence. 
17   INT. MARRON MANSION - VARIOUS ROOMS - DAY                  17 The deeper Frank walks into the house, the warmer and more lived-in rooms appear. 
18   INT. MARRON MANSION - SUN ROOM - DAY                       18 Frank steps into a tiled room that overlooks the pool area. One wall is all glass. On the opposite wall are shelves containing the trophies of Rachel Marron's career: A Tony award, three Grammy's, gold and platinum records, other statuettes and plaques. Among the framed photo- graphs of Rachel accepting awards etc., is one of her and 
her small son, FLETCHER, dressed in a tuxedo. Both are goofing off for the camera with obvious affection. Frank looks down at the pool. FRANK'S POV Dwarfed by the pool, the only person in sight is seven- year old Fletcher, the little boy from the photograph, dark-haired and fragile. He is crouched at the side of the pool with the remote control unit for a foot-long speedboat which is cutting across the water. A nanny sits, some way off, embroidering. Frank's attention is distracted. A heavier BASS MUSICAL BEAT comes from somewhere nearby in the house, another Rachel Marron number, but this time up-tempo and bouncy. Frank follows the sound. 
19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - DAY                                     19 Frank walks into the rear of the room that the noise is coming from. It is large and comfortable with plenty of seating, a bar, a wall of stereo gear and a projection booth. It is packed with people, props and video equipment. There is lots of activity, a general air of barely-organized chaos. MUSIC BLARES out. A group of six dancers, is rehearsing an energetic dance number for a music video, directed by their choreographer RORY. Sunlight throws them in a silhouette against the glass wall at the end of the room. A video cameraman circles them, taping the rehearsal, which appears on a large-screen TV behind them. In one corner, a pretty black girl is being pinned into a proposed costume for the video. Several people are stand- ing around, tending to the video and playback gear. All the chairs face the far end of the room and it isn't immediately apparent how many more people are hidden among the big cushions. As Frank sits on the barstool at the back, a large swivel chair turns to reveal Devaney. He waves to Frank and makes his way over to him. On the other side of the room, a brawny, heavyset man in his late thirties rises to look at Frank. He has a twenty inch neck. Devaney signals to him  that everything is all right. The brawny man looks at Frank a moment more, then sits down. Frank looks around the room. A shelf laden with vitamins. Guitars of various makes. A flute. A gold record being used as a coaster. People smoking and chatting through the rehearsal. 
20   EXT. MARRON GROUNDS - BACK LAWN - DAY                       20 Frank is walking rapidly away from the window wall, down the slope. Devaney is scurrying to keep up. 
DEVANEY Farmer, will you wait a minute? I should have told you more. I'm sorry but I was afraid she wouldn't go through with it. I thought I'd let the two of you work it out... come to an understanding. FRANK We did. Frank starts to walk off.   Devaney is grasping at straws. DEVANEY She's not a bad person, and whether she knows it or not, she needs you. (a beat) You've come this far... Would you just wait here for one minute. I want to show you something. Please, Farmer. Devaney runs back to the house. 
21   EXT. POOL AREA - DAY                                        21 Fletcher, happy to have someone to talk to,  walks up to Frank with his remote-control speed boat.   Frank would like to walk away, but Fletcher blocks his  way. Frank looks at Fletcher's frail little, nut-brown  figure. The watching nanny continues her embroidering,  some way off. FLETCHER Hi! FRANK (continuing to walk) Hi. FLETCHER How are you today? FRANK (wants to keep walking) All right. How 'bout yourself? FLETCHER Oh, I'm fine. Do you like boats? 
Frank gives up.    He's not going to get out of here.   He stops. FRANK No.     I don't like boats. FLETCHER You don't!     Why not? FRANK Oh, I don't know. FLETCHER Sure you do, but you don't want to tell me. 
Frank considers him, then slips out of his sport coat. He crouches down so that he is eye-level with Fletcher. FRANK You're a smart kid. Fletcher nods. FRANK I'll tell you. One time I was stuck on a boat with some people for four months. FLETCHER A lifeboat? FRANK Nope. A big white yacht.      Do you know what a yacht is? FLETCHER (thinks about this) Yeah.     My mom rented this huge yacht    once, and we took a trip. It was    great. Everyone threw up except    me. I love 'em. FRANK (standing to leave) Well, nobody's perfect. Fletcher squints up at him, the sun in his eyes. FLETCHER You're the bodyguard, aren't you? Frank is surprised. FRANK What do you know about it? 
FLETCHER I've got ears. FRANK I'll remember that. Devaney trots into the pool area, out of breath. He is holding a bulging manila file. As he sees Fletcher, he holds the file casually at his side. Frank sees Fletcher looking at the file. DEVANEY How are you, Fletch? (to Frank) I'm glad you waited.    Let's go over here. FRANK (to Fletcher) Nice meeting you. Fletcher looks after them silently. 
22   EXT. PATIO - DAY                                           22 Devaney slides the file across the table at Frank, open- ing it. Inside are letters of every size and condition. Repeatedly throughout this scene Frank's gaze is drawn to Fletcher, who has started his boat again. DEVANEY This is just in the last six months. FRANK (looks at the pile) Have you ever tried having these professionally assessed? Devaney shakes his head no. Frank begins to look through the letters, flipping them by the corner of the page. From many different sources, some are scrawled, some typed, some assembled from cutouts. Many are soiled and torn, others immaculate. Occasionally, one will have a photo of Rachel with crude markings on it. Spector enters sucking on a popsicle. He comes to stand over Frank's shoulder, peering nonchalantly at the piles of letters. SPECTOR Devaney says you were in the Secret Service. Frank nods. 
Frank goes through them quickly, with an expert eye. He sometimes pauses to read one more carefully. A few he removes from the stack and places in the center of the table. SPECTOR Ever guard the main man? FRANK I was two years with Carter and four years with Reagan. Frank sets another letter in the center pile.   He stops, smiling at it. 
FRANK This is a little old lady in Akron. She's written to everybody I've ever worked for. He continues to turn until something stops him. Several letters are paper-clipped together. They are the pasted- up type we saw being assembled on the desk top. SPECTOR Reagan got shot. His chatter is beginning to annoy Frank. FRANK Not on my shift. Spector emits a gratuitous laugh, acknowledges the joke. SPECTOR That's good. Frank goes back to his letters.   He taps the stack in the center of the table. FRANK At first glance, these don't bother me. But keep them. You never know. He separates one letter from the others. FRANK This could be something. Devaney searches Frank's face. DEVANEY You think it could be the same guy? The one who rigged the doll? 
FRANK I don't know. Did you tell Miss Marron about it? Does she know about the doll? Devaney and Spector exchange looks.   This is evidently a sore point between them. 
SPECTOR We said there'd been some electrical problem while she was on stage. Short circuit. Look, she doesn't need that kind of worry right now. It would upset her. FRANK What about the police? SPECTOR There was no reason for the police. No one got hurt. FRANK What about the chauffeur? SPECTOR It was nothing. It was just our people there. Frank turns and watches Fletcher by the pool.   Devaney's eyes are still on Frank's face. DEVANEY Sy, I think we should show him the room. 
23   INT. ROOM - DAY                                             23 Frank follows Spector and Devaney into the room. He glances around, taking in the murals, the decor, the kitsch attempt at fornicatorial splendour right from the pages of a tabloid layout. FRANK Is this her bedroom? SPECTOR Yes. DEVANEY No. She sleeps in a room next to Fletcher's down the hall. Sy had this done for a magazine layout, SPECTOR 'Superstars in their Boudoirs.' 
love. I'm not some hired fuckin' gun who is out to make her life miserable. While Tony speaks, Frank's eyes dart to the side mirror; his gaze never leaves it. 
FRANK'S POV - BLACK TOYOTA appears in the rearview mirror. BACK TO SCENE TONY I do things the way she likes. Her happiness is everything to me. 
Frank speaks while concentrating on the mirror. FRANK No problem. I'd like to know how you handle things, Tony. TONY I handle things fine, Frank. You watch me and you'll learn something. FRANK (to Henry) Turn left. HENRY Is that him? Frank shakes his head, he's not sure.   Tony reacts. TONY Hey, what's going on? FRANK Shortcut. FRANK'S POV - TOYOTA IN REARVIEW MIRROR As the limo turns, the 4 X 4 follows them into the turn. ANGLE - FRANK whispers to Henry. FRANK Slow down, very slow. HENRY You want me to do a one-eighty? 
FRANK No, just slow down. The car slows. ANGLE - SPECTOR AND RACHEL IN BACK 
They look up from some papers. SPECTOR Why are we stopping?    Are we here? Behind them, THROUGH the rear window, the 4 X 4 can be seen. Sensing something, it makes a sudden TIRE- SCREECHING left turn, disappearing behind them. 
41   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  41 The limo enters the gate where workmen are rigging a large fence. 
42   INT. LIMO - DAY                                           42 Frank speaks to Henry. FRANK Stop here... Take them to the house. Frank jumps out and jumps a hedge, racing toward the lawn and work area. ANGLE - TONY, RACHEL AND SPECTOR As the car pulls away they see Frank running wildly across the property. TONY What's with him? 
43   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  43 As Frank comes through some bushes, he suddenly catches a glimpse of the 4 X 4 through the trees. It starts to accelerate. As it pulls away (it is too far to record the license number), he breaks into a full run toward the other end of the property. Leaping hedges, Frank crashes through tropical vegetation. CRASHING through a bamboo forest, he scurries down a steep wooded slope toward the road below. The 4 X 4 can be glimpsed through the trees as he runs to head it off. 
A retaining wall about   14 feet high rises from the road to the slope. Without    a pause, as the car speeds beneath, Frank leaps and drops   the full distance to the road. The 4 X 4 ROARS PAST just   missing him and turns a corner. Hitting hard, Frank allows his knees to take the force of the fall, deliberately rolling once before he springs into a crouched upright position. But the 4 X 4 speeds around a corner and is gone. 
44   INT. MARRON ESTATE - DAY                                  44 The fortification  continues as workmen tighten screws, install electrical  wiring, test alarms. As Frank watches over the work, we  see him show Henry how to wear a SURV KIT communications  system. FRANK Keep this loose. Fletcher comes to take a look too.   He peers up at Frank, expectantly. FLETCHER Tell me about the car? FRANK Toyota.     Black. FLETCHER Four wheel drive? Late model? Frank nods.   Fletcher looks pleased. FRANK One snag though. Fletcher's face falls. FLETCHER What? FRANK 360,000 of them in Los Angeles.    I checked. Nice work, though. FLETCHER (shrugging) Well, nobody's perfect, Frank. Are they? (gesturing to the SURV KIT) Can I try that? 
45   EXT. MARRON ESTATE POOLSIDE - DAY                          45 Rachel has been watching Fletcher and Frank down the hill. Now she leans back on the chaise lounge where she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song on a Walkman. 
There is the SCREECHING howl of a DRILL on METAL from the direction of the house. Rachel jumps up and yells toward the house. RACHEL Shut up you assholes! 
49    INT. THRIFT SHOP - CLOSE ON CLOTHES HANGER - DAY            49 SCREECHING as it's slid along a metal rack. Rachel is shopping for bargains, moving along racks of discarded clothing. RACHEL Louise, you've got too much great stuff. OWNER (from the back of the shop, laughing) Take it all, darlin'. Frank leans casually against a wall, not watching Rachel, but watching the shop, watching the street outside. Rachel finds something she likes. RACHEL Wooo!   Let me try this on. She flicks a glance to Frank; he's not looking at her. She pulls back the curtain of the makeshift changing booth, then stops dramatically. 
RACHEL (to Frank, indicating the open booth) Farmer, do you want to come in here with me? Just to be safe? Frank glances at her, then resumes his surveillance of the shop. Rachel's head bobs up and down above the curtain as she changes. RACHEL You probably won't believe this, but I have a reputation for being a bitch. Frank says nothing. He gazes outside through the store- front window and sees Henry and Tony horsing around next to the limo. A few small boys stand around the car. One of them is climbing onto the hood. RACHEL I didn't used to be. But you get known for being a certain way -- a way people think you are -- and pretty soon you get like that. Can't help it. Frank smiles knowingly.   Rachel notices. RACHEL You don't think so? You're such an expert on famous people? FRANK I've seen a few. RACHEL And you disagree? FRANK (very flat) You can be as you choose to be. It's an act of discipline sometimes, but it can be done. Rachel stops in her tracks... then opens the curtains and looks at herself in the mirror. Also reflected in the mirror is Frank. RACHEL That why you never stay with one of your clients? They too undisciplined for you? Or is it you're afraid you'll start to care about them? 
FRANK (without interest) That's right. Rachel turns to Frank. RACHEL Can't you answer straight just once? Why don't you talk to me? I'm not such a bad lady. FRANK You're too clever for me.   I can't keep up. Frank continues to search the shop and street with his gaze. Rachel steps closer to him. RACHEL Look at me, Farmer! Frank turns and looks at her. RACHEL You don't approve of me, do you? FRANK Disapproval's a luxury I can't afford. Gets in the way. RACHEL Don't like emotions getting to you, huh? Never mix business with pleasure? FRANK That's right. It's a stand-off. After a moment, Rachel motions to an outfit on a rack just behind him. RACHEL Grab that would you? Frank takes a beat.   Looks out the window. FRANK I'm here to keep you alive... not to help you shop. Fuming, Rachel sizes things up, then grabs it herself, whipping the curtain shut behind her. A smile plays across Frank's face. 
50   INT. DARKENED ROOM - CLOSEUP - NIGHT                       50 We see a man's hands remove a video cassette from its sleeve. The cover reads "RACHEL MARRON - THE #1 HITS." The CASSETTE is gently eased into the slot of the video player. 
Rachel's image appears on the screen, singing softly, intensely, passionately into the camera. WE TRACK INTO the image, as if a little hypnotized by it. ANGLE FRANK Frank sits alone in his room, lit by the glow of the TV, dressed in a business-style blue suit and tie. He's watching Rachel's videos. Scattered around the video player are a collection of other Rachel Marron CD's, tapes and videos. Frank has been noting down lyrics on the yellow legal pad on his lap. Some of the phrases are circled. As he watches, we see a subtle change in his expression. It is as if he really were looking at Rachel for the first time, here, watching her sing. For a second, she seems to be singing to him alone, passionate and vulnerable. He opens a small box and removes a tiny enamelled Russian Orthodox-type cross. He fastens the clasp, checking that it holds, then looks back to the screen. 
51   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - NIGHT                                 51 Rachel's SONG PLAYS OVER the moonlit estate. 
52   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              52 The room is surprisingly bare and simple, almost empty apart from Rachel's collection of old and faded dolls on the shelves and on the bed. Rachel is getting dressed for the evening. A hairdresser stands behind her, fussing with her hair. Rachel hears the MUSIC coming from outside and moves to the window. (The hairdresser moves with her, still busy with the brush.) Gazing across the garden, she sees the light in Frank's room and hears her own voice singing out from there too. 
53   EXT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  53 Frank is showing Henry how to check the underside of the limo with an angled mirror on a stick. Both are crouched beside the vehicle. A noise makes them look up. Rachel, dressed to the nines and looking very sexy, emerges from the house with Spector and Devaney. Spector's carrying a videotape. Tony follows as they head for the car, where 
Frank and Henry are waiting. Fletcher stands in the doorway, flanked by uniformed security guards. He waves at Frank. FRANK (to Henry) I thought it was dinner. 
Henry shrugs. FRANK (to Spector) Are we going somewhere else? SPECTOR The Mayan, Frank. 
FRANK What's the Mayan? Spector starts to climb into the limo. SPECTOR It's a club, Frank. Come on, Henry, let's go. FRANK Spector, you've got to tell me about these things. SPECTOR I just did. He disappears inside the limo. Rachel tugs at Frank's lapels, looks him up and down, brushing something off his shoulder. Frank's annoyed. RACHEL Nice suit, Frank. Rachel is about to get in. FRANK Rachel. He removes something from his pocket, a small enameled cross. FRANK I want you to keep this. Rachel looks at it, both flattered and confused. RACHEL For me?   It's beautiful. 
FRANK It's fitted with a radio transmitter. When you close the clasp, it sends a signal. If there's ever a problem and we're separated, just press it and I'll know you need me. 
RACHEL Tell me what? DEVANEY There were some letters before, Rachel... same kind of thing, threats, oddball stuff... SPECTOR We didn't want to worry you... DEVANEY ... and somebody got into the house... 
RACHEL (starting to panic) Someone was in my house? SPECTOR Okay.   Let's not get hysterical... FRANK Let's get her out of here. RACHEL Someone was in my house? SPECTOR It was weeks ago. You were out of town... RACHEL While Fletcher was there? SPECTOR Listen, Fletcher is okay. The house is like Fort Knox now. Right, Frank? FRANK We should get her out of here. Right now! SPECTOR There's no way anyone could... RACHEL No way anyone could what? SPECTOR No, wait... look everybody calm down. Calm down. DEVANEY Sy. 
SPECTOR Let's just see how she is. (to Rachel) How do you feel, honey? Someone comes through the door with some flowers.   Frank eases them out and gently closes the door. FRANK I can't protect her out there. RACHEL Do you think he's out there? Devaney can't answer.   She turns to Frank. 
RACHEL He's here, isn't he? FRANK He might be. SPECTOR We don't know that. Frank, we don't know that. Rachel is enraged. RACHEL But you know he was in my house... oh my God. DEVANEY Let's go home, Sy. We'll have to make an announcement. SPECTOR Fine, you make it, they'll tear the fucking place apart. 
61   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                        61 A lone mike stands onstage. The crowd's growing im- patient. A RHYTHMIC CLAPPING begins. Devaney walks timidly onstage. He's not happy to be there. He reaches the mike and taps it with a finger. DEVANEY Excuse me... hello... I've got an announcement to make. I'm sorry but... due to circumstances beyond... Voices shout. "Where's Rachel?"... a groan begins. A chorus of boos fills the room. He raises his hands. 
More voices. 
62   INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                    62 Frank guides Rachel toward the stage exit. A roar from the audience begins. "Rachel! Rachel! Rachel!" It grows louder as they near the exit. Rachel's expression is a combination of fear and humiliation. When they have almost reached the exit, she stops. RACHEL Wait... FRANK Rachel... don't do it.    It's not worth it... RACHEL (cutting him off) No fucking freak is gonna chase me off stage. She pulls away from him.    Farmer starts after her, closely followed by Spector. 
63   INT. STAGE - NIGHT                                        63 DEVANEY I'm afraid that... A great gush of applause from the audience. Devaney's befuddled. He doesn't see Rachel walking up behind him. DEVANEY Rachel won't be able... Rachel stands beside him beaming. She bows. Claps back to her fans. Devaney retreats. Rachel gestures in his direction. RACHEL Bill Devaney, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, Bill. Hey, everyone. Hello! Isn't Billy Thomas the greatest. He's asked me to sing a song. I hope you don't mind. The crowd roars its approval. Frank nervously scans the room. Rachel smiles and moves along the stage. MUSIC starts in the b.g. Masking obvious fear, she starts to sing. As she takes one hand from the microphone, her fingers tremble. She clasps it again to hide her anxiety. 
ANGLE - RACHEL - SHOT FROM BEHIND shows her alone and vulnerable, bathed in light, center- stage. Rachel snatches a quick glance at Frank then looks back to her silent audience. ANGLE - FRANK He scans the audience intensely, face to face. 
63A   EXT. MAYAN - BACKSTAGE DOOR - NIGHT                        63A 
Rachel's limo stands waiting. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a black Toyota 4 X 4 parked among the other cars. 
63B   INT. MAYAN - NIGHT                                         63B Rachel approaches the end of her song, her voice coming ever stronger. Spector comes up to Frank in the wings, positioning himself combatively between Frank and his view of Rachel. SPECTOR Are we having a communications problem here? FRANK What? Spector's presence is a distraction. Frank steps to one side for a better view of Rachel. Spector moves too. SPECTOR Apparently, I didn't make it clear to you how things go around here. FRANK You told me you were going to tell her. And you didn't. SPECTOR I didn't think she could handle it. FRANK But she handled it fine. Frank continues to peer past Spector's shoulder, his vigilance undiminished. Soothed and nurtured by the obvious admiration of her audience, Rachel's fear is beginning to vanish. The song is taking over. Spector changes tack, becoming confidential, "man-to-man." 
uncomfortable.   Henry senses what is going on and speaks softly. HENRY Never done that before. FRANK It's been a long night. 
70   INT. THE MAYAN - NIGHT                                     70 The crowd is thinning out. A dim worklight is burning somewhere backstage. The auditorium is a mess; the cleaning crew has begun to work on the debris from the riot. FOOTSTEPS APPROACH, walking, pausing, as if looking for something. Lying on the floor in big CLOSEUP we see a small  fragment of Rachel's dress. The FOOTSTEPS STOP by it. A    hand picks it up gently and lifts it OUT OF FRAME. We   hear the sound of a deep lingering INHALATION of breath.   The feet move on. 
71   INT. MARRON HOUSE - NIGHT                                  71 Fletcher is asleep in his bed. Frank waits as Rachel glances in. Then she moves away. Opening the door to her room, she steps back, allowing him to enter ahead. 
72   INT. RACHEL'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 72 Frank moves quickly into the room, checking the window and French door. Rachel waits silently by the door. All is clear. He steps back to the door. As he approaches her she begins to tremble. He gently reaches out and takes her in his arms. Slowly holding her he leads her to bed, moving aside some of Rachel's dolls, laid out on the pillows. Her hands go automatically to her dress but they are shaking so badly she cannot undo it. Frank gently does it for her. She willingly allows him to undress her and not a word is spoken between them. As she sits naked still trembling, he pulls down the covers and guides her gently into bed. As he adjusts the covers she reaches up and takes hold of his hand. He looks down, stroking her forehead like a child's. RACHEL Aren't you going to ask me why I behave like that? 
FRANK I know why. 
73   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT                                      73 
Frank sits alone at a table in the huge kitchen, care- fully cutting and eating a peach.  The door at the other end of the room slams open and Tony stalks in, soaking wet. He has just made his way home  from the MAYAN and he is boiling. He sights on Frank and  moves toward him fast. Frank just watches until Tony is almost upon him. As Tony reaches out to lift him by his shirt, Frank spins low out of his seat. Tony's legs are knocked out from under him. He lands hard on his back and finds himself looking up at Frank, who holds him down with the chair he was sitting on, like a lion tamer, a leg strut pressed against Tony's throat. Frank looks down at him question- ingly, as if to ask, "Had enough?" Tony scowls and nods. Frank lifts the chair away. Tony stands up and faces him. Frank turns away and Tony throws a punch at his head, barely catching him as Frank ducks and moves in under it. He hits Tony twice and throws him against a cabinet. Tony gets up slowly, looks around and grabs a carving knife from a hook on the wall. He holds it in front of him threateningly. Frank shakes his head. He's getting irritated. He picks up the knife he's been using on the peach and flips it in his hand so he's holding it by the blade. With the same fluid motion we've seen earlier, he throws it at Tony. It sticks in the wall an inch from Tony's ear. Tony does a slow take and then lowers his blade. Frank picks up his dirty dish and takes it to the sink. He glances at Tony. FRANK I don't want to talk about this again. 
74   EXT. MARRON ESTATE - DRIVEWAY - DAWN                      74 Frank has been talking to the uniformed guard in the gate house and now begins walking up the drive toward the man- sion. The grounds are quiet, beautiful, misty. We see him from behind some foliage, as if he's being covertly observed, stalked. A twig snaps and he turns sharply. It's Rachel. She's dressed in a soft jumpsuit and starts jogging out from behind the bushes towards him. 
The suit softens her appearance; she looks lovely. Her manner, too, has altered; she is charming -- friendly and very girlish. RACHEL Hey!   Gotcha, didn't I? 
FRANK Hey. RACHEL You're probably wondering what I'm doing. (as Frank nods) You didn't know I jogged, did you? 
Frank shakes his head. RACHEL What's the matter? 'Fraid I'll get picked off in my snazzy running suit? FRANK No. I'm afraid I'll have to jog with you. They both smile. RACHEL Great.    I guess I can't do it. Rachel stops pumping, gasps for air, and for one moment, rests a hand on Frank's arm to support herself. She removes it quickly. RACHEL Will you walk with me a little? Frank nods and they cut off across the grounds. RACHEL (hard for her) I know this is kinda late, but thank you. I'm really glad you're here. (she looks at him) I'm going to try to cooperate. FRANK That would be good. They walk in silence for few moments. When Rachel finally speaks, she sounds genuinely unsure of herself, nervous. It's very appealing. And if it's an act, she's a terrific actress. 
RACHEL Farmer... I have this problem. This minor little problem. You see, I'd like to go out for an evening. Just me and a guy. You know... (makes a funny face) ... like a 'date.' But I can't go out on a date because you have to be with me every minute. I mean, what if he invited me up to his place afterwards? Are you going to come, too? (a beat) So the only thing I can figure is for you to take me out. (pause) So... that's what I was wondering ... you know. What do you think? But only if you want to. Frank is bemused. RACHEL Only if you want to... I'm not so bad... (looks at him) God, this is embarrassing. I'm gonna run up ahead there. You decide. She runs up the hill to the pool area, which is now above them. He walks up after her. 
95   INT. SQUIRREL HILL PRODUCTIONS - RACHEL'S OFFICE - DAY   95 The office is filled with congratulatory balloons and flowers heralding the morning's news. Spector's secretary is taking congratulatory phone messages at a desk in the b.g. Two assistants are struggling in through the door with a large basketed floral arrangement. 
Spector confronts Frank across his desk. SPECTOR Put together a list of   your expenses. Your total    billing... Let me have it in one   hour and I'll see that a check   is cut. FRANK Don't you ever say what's on your mind? Spector cannot believe he's being so addressed -- especially in front the staff. The assistants stop in their tracks and look. SPECTOR (almost shouts) What's on my mind is that you're fired, Frank. She missed all her interviews yesterday because of your little date. Do you realize she stood up Barbara Walters? First you fuck up her career... Behind Spector, out of his line of sight, Rachel and Devaney appear in the doorway with more cards. They also stop and listen. SPECTOR ... and now you're fucking with her head. FRANK That's between us. SPECTOR You think so? You forget who signs your check. You don't understand the role I play around here. 
FRANK No.   I understand. Spector stiffens, then decides not to take this one on. SPECTOR Get your shit together and be out of here by noon. DEVANEY Frank stays. Spector looks round, sees that Devaney and Rachel have been listening. Rachel is silent. With a curt nod of his head, Spector gestures to the assistants to leave the room. Devaney weighs in. 
DEVANEY With this high a profile, Rachel needs protection now more than ever. If he goes, you can forget Miami... SPECTOR She's signed the fucking contract, Bill. You want me to read it to you? Rachel is watching them both. DEVANEY Fuck the contract. If he goes, she's not singing a note. It's too dangerous. SPECTOR Oh. 'Fuck the contract.' Great. Why don't you let Rachel speak for herself? I think she has some say in this. RACHEL (flatly) Frank stays. Spector considers her for a beat, then looks at the others. The secretary interrupts from the back of the office. SECRETARY (O.S.) Mr. Schiller calling on line one... Spector ignores her, still holding his look at Devaney, Rachel and Frank. SPECTOR Well, I guess this is democracy in action. 
Rachel nods. Spector, turning to take the call, flashes her a "little boy" look. SPECTOR I gave in. That's not easy for me. Don't I get a hug? 
Rachel is stone-faced.   Spector covers by picking up the phone. SPECTOR (into phone) Yeah?... Sure, put him on... Ben how are you?... uh huh... 
Frank and Rachel look at each other in silence. SPECTOR ...The Ambassador? What the hell are you trying to pull, Ben? Rachel always gets the Presidential... I don't care what you thought... Devaney leans to Frank as Spector's conversation continues in the b.g. DEVANEY Do you know the Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami Beach? Frank nods. DEVANEY How does the Ambassador Suite compare to the Presidential for us? Frank thinks only for a moment. FRANK It's on the twentieth    floor in the south wing. There's a     service elevator right there.     Mainly ocean windows. Should     be no problem. SPECTOR (into phone) ... I'm aware of that, Ben, but let me just remind you people that you invited us... Frank turns toward the door. 
RACHEL (to Frank) Hang around, Farmer. We might need your vaunted expertise. She reaches forward and hits a button on Spector's desk, throwing the call onto a speaker. 
RACHEL (sweetly) Hello, Ben honey. SCHILLER (V.O.) Rachel, congratulations, you must be thrilled at the... 
RACHEL (across him) Ben. I hear you've got me in the annex next to the kitchen. 
96   EXT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL (MIAMI BEACH) - HELICOPTER SHOT 96 - DAY We COME STREAKING IN OVER the ocean TOWARD the towering white Fontainebleau. ON the SOUNDTRACK, we hear JOHN TESH'S VOICE filling the viewers in on the latest Hollywood dirt. JOHN TESH (V.O.) ...It's off to Sun City today for Best Actress nominee Rachel Marron. Rachel's giving two AIDS charity concerts this week at Miami's Fontainebleau Hotel. A thousand a plate no less. And rumor has it that the lovely lady has unseated the governor of Florida himself. Seems there was a showdown on who'll get to lounge in that big Fontainebleau penthouse tonight. As we CIRCLE the top floor, we see a tiny figure on the balcony. JOHN TESH (V.O.) Well, sleep tight in the Presidential Suite, Rachel. Who says a nomination isn't as good as winning... 
97   EXT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - BALCONY - DAY                    97 Frank looks up at the disappearing helicopter then down 
112   EXT. POOL AREA - DAY                                         112 This place is crowded with hundreds   of guests basking on chaise lounges. A sea of sun-baked    faces virtually as far as the eye can see. The sight    of the crowd and the presence of the news crew seems to   push Rachel to a whole new adrenaline level. Rachel walks among them, moving swiftly, evaluating the bodies displayed before her in words and expressions, playing to the camera. RACHEL Oh my God. Look what they're wearing. Mother, hide your eyes... Heads turn to look. RACHEL I couldn't wear that suit... Honey, you're naked... Of course, if I had a body like that... There is a murmur of recognition from some of the guests. She pauses to shake a hand, and now all the guests throughout the pool area are aware that Rachel Marron is among them. People stand on chairs, scramble for pens and paper, run 
to get a closer look. Lounges collapse, drink GLASSES are BROKEN, flower tubs are trampled. A lot of pushing and shoving starts - too much for the video crew, who abandon the filming attempt. SPECTOR Great, babe. They got what they needed. Let's get back inside. Frank increases his pace to keep by Rachel's side, gently easing a path for her. Schiller scurries behind in Frank's wake. Rachel turns suddenly as a tall good-looking lifeguard appears in the throng. She eyes him appreciatively. 
RACHEL (to lifeguard) You look like a man of good taste to me. Come to my party tonight. (to Schiller) Ben, make sure this boy gets to my party. Schiller nods. Rachel glances at Frank, making sure he gets the point, and then she's off again. The throng gets tighter. Frank's having to work harder, steering her towards the door back into the hotel. The familiar chant starts up: "Rachel, Rachel." It's starting to resemble the frenzy of the opening scene. This time, amid the thrusting hands and clamoring faces, a few bewildered elderly guests look dazed as they are shoved forward. A child starts crying, lost in the mess of legs and Bermuda shorts. A distraught mother tries to reach him. Someone is jostled into the pool as the crowd surges again. Amid the chaos, whistles and scattered applause.   Rachel drinks it all in. RACHEL (over her shoulder) Thank you. Thank you. Come tonight and give till it hurts. With a final surge, Frank makes it to the door with his party. The door closes shut behind them. A mass of distorted faces pushes onto the glass. The party walks on briskly. RACHEL (to Spector) I'm beginning to wonder about your judgement, Sy. Why do I have to keep paying my dues if I've already arrived? 
SPECTOR (very fast) Kick me, beat me... whatever makes you feel good. But let's not pretend you don't like it. We're too close for that. Whipping people into a frenzy is why you got into it in the first place. Rachel's eyes lock with  Spector's -- there's a real connec- tion and understanding  here that she spends a lot of time denying. Frank sees it   as clearly as Spector, whose tone becomes almost soothing  -- SPECTOR And it's nothing to be ashamed of, either, not for a second. It's a gift... and only a handful are given it. Many call but few are answered. SPECTOR (CONT'D) Don't fool with the blessing, Rachel. The magic is sustained through its use. RACHEL Now you're going to tell me about magic? Give it a rest will ya... SPECTOR I'm done. Not another word... (a crooked smile) ... I know you like to be reminded sometimes. Rachel looks away.   It's true.   He's good at his job. 
113    INT. GRAND CENTRAL ROOM - ON STAGE - NIGHT                113 In the spotlight, all alone, Rachel Marron works her magic. She sings, as it was meant to be sung, "I Have Nothing." One person does not look at Rachel. He stands in a corner in front of the stage easily in the shadows. His eyes continually scanning. Picking up every movement. All alone. Watching. 
113A   EXT. FONTAINEBLEAU HOTEL - NIGHT                          113A Fireworks explode over the water. 
114   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  114 In the living room, the first night party is in full swing. Crowded. Smoky. Noisy. Fireworks burst outside the windows. People clap. A mixed bag of upscale partygoers: women in party dresses, men in open shirts, etc. A black pianist is playing. Two bars at either end of the room. Waiters work the room with platters of canapes. 
115   INT. RACHEL'S SUITE - OUTSIDE MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT      115 Tony sits in a chair watching TV, a drink in his hand, oblivious to all. The lifeguard shuts Rachel's door be- hind him and makes his way down to the party. He pauses at the head of the stairs, checking out the party, and grabs a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. Frank catches the movement; the two men briefly lock eyes. The lifeguard responds with a knowing smile. 
116   EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE SUITE - NIGHT                        116 Thuringer has set up a checkpoint through which all guests are passing. As they get off the elevator, they walk up to a desk manned by one of Thuringer's uniformed guards. When their names have been checked off a master list, they walk past another guard wielding a metal detector. No one likes it, but they all do it. Most of the local TV stations have sent camera crews.    The handheld cameras move among the guests, their bright lights flaring. FLASHBULBS POP. It's a local media event. Frank squints as a quartz light shines straight in his face. A tall, fit, athletic-looking man raises his arms; is cleared by the metal detector. He is GREG PORTMAN. 
117   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  117 Portman makes his way through the crowd to the bar. His eyes scan the suite. His gaze settles on Frank checking out the people who filter in. Portman appears next to Frank. PORTMAN Hello, Farmer. 
FRANK Portman. PORTMAN Buy you a drink? FRANK Orange juice. It's been awhile. You on the job? PORTMAN (nods) Technically I'm off duty,   but the Governor may show up here   later, so I thought I'd give it   a light check. (smiles) Someone else is covering   him right now. FRANK How old is she? PORTMAN Maybe eighteen. You working? Rachel makes her entrance, and poses self-mocking on the landing above the crowd, accepting applause. She has succeeded in under-dressing everyone in the room. She is a star. Frank nods in her direction... that's his client. PORTMAN (impressed) No kidding? I'd call that a step up from the President. Probably sings better too. RACHEL Thank you.   Thank you.   You're so right. SCATTERED LAUGHS. RACHEL I want everyone to have a good time and drink as much of Ben Schiller's liquor as you like. Rachel descends into the crowd, laughing and blowing kisses. PORTMAN Handful. Frank's look says if you only knew the half of it. 
PORTMAN I heard you had to take someone out in New York. Frank remembers. PORTMAN I lost track of you after the Reagan thing. FRANK Yeah. PORTMAN It wasn't your fault, Farmer. You weren't even there. 
126   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              126 Rachel and Portman are still locked in the clinch. Realizing what she's doing, Rachel suddenly pulls back, 
catching herself. RACHEL I'm not doing this. PORTMAN (still holding her) I think you are. She steps out of his embrace. RACHEL I said I was grateful.   Thank you and good night. She looks to the door that leads back to the party. The SOUNDS of CELEBRATION CONTINUE outside. She starts to cross to the door. RACHEL (cool) Please go now. Portman moves toward her as she opens the door, reaching for her arm. Then he sees, through the doorway, Tony standing in the hall talking to a woman. Tony looks up at the sound of the door and sees them both. Rachel slips quickly out of Portman's grip. RACHEL Mr. Portman was just leaving us, Tony. Portman hesitates, then smiles at Rachel and Tony and, with a quick peck on Rachel's cheek, slips past them back to the party. Rachel briefly scans the party crowd over Tony's shoulder but she doesn't see Frank. The door closes, leaving her alone in the room again. She reaches for a bottle of Scotch and raises it to her mouth, drinking straight from the bottle. 
127   EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT                                       127 Frank looks out at the ocean. ECHOING on the soundtrack, we hear the song 'WHAT BECOMES OF THE BROKEN HEARTED' that Rachel and Frank danced to. It sounds slow and sweet and a long way away. Frank stares out at the ocean. Totally divorced from everything in the suite behind him, in the world around him. There is only the moon and the ocean. For this 
one moment, his guard is down. 
127A   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                127A A chambermaid is Hoovering the floor. Rachel steps out of her bedroom. She looks terrible. Hungover, she is wearing sunglasses and a loose smock. It is noon of the following day. 
130    INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - KITCHEN - DAY                    130 Frank is sitting at the kitchen table eating a sandwich. Behind him, in the dining room, a Cuban maid has set a place with breakfast. She is pouring orange juice as Rachel walks in. Rachel sits down at the table as though the walk in had been a terrible effort. She looks at the breakfast with distaste and picks up the coffee. Frank continues to eat. Rachel looks at him. RACHEL (nasty) What the hell are you looking at? (pause) You probably never had a heavy night in your whole, goddamn disciplined life. Frank looks at her, continues to eat. RACHEL You know, Farmer, you're a self- righteous son-of-a-bitch. Frank has to smile at this, which makes Rachel even angrier. RACHEL Don't laugh at me, goddamit!   And don't you dare judge me. FRANK Give me a break, will ya? I didn't tell you to fuck everybody in the hotel! 
132    INT. CLEANING SUPPLY WAREHOUSE - DAY                       132 Special  Agents Court and Minella are watching the general manager  of the supply house as he pries the top off a huge canister  marked "INDUSTRIAL DETERGENT." The general manager  lifts the lid to reveal white powder. 
He talks animatedly and gestures around the warehouse. Court listens, nodding. Minella spoons some of the powder into a plastic bag and seals it. OVER this we hear Court's voice, filtered as on a telephone line. COURT (V.O.) It matches the traces in the glue, Frank. We're getting to him. We're gonna nail this fucker. 
133   INT. FONTAINEBLEAU - LOBBY - DAY                            133 Frank is on the courtesy phone. FRANK Yeah, well, don't take too long, Ray. COURT (V.O.) Hey, Frank.   It's good money, isn't it? Frank hangs up. 
134   INT. 20TH FLOOR HALLWAY - OUTSIDE PRESIDENTIAL SUITE -      134 DAY The elevator door opens and  Frank steps out. He walks toward the entrance to  the suite and is immediately alarmed by what  he sees: there is no uniformed guard by the front  door. He unlocks the door and goes inside. 
135   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - ENTRANCE - DAY                    135 Frank comes in and looks around quickly. FRANK'S POV - LIVING ROOM Looking over living room, hallways, balcony.    No one in sight. Nothing disturbed. Devaney comes out of Rachel's bedroom, a panicked look on his face. BACK TO SCENE They face each other across the gulf of the living room. FRANK Where is she? Where's Tony? 
DEVANEY I don't know. I thought you were with her. 
the Cuban's ears simultaneously with cupped hands. The Cuban goes down, stunned. Frank, his expression fierce, is upon him immediately. Frank's arms entwine the Cuban's and he begins to lift him roughly. At the end of the corridor, a woman screams. 
CLEANING WOMAN (O.S.) Stop! Please. Don't hurt him. Please stop! Frank looks up. A hotel CLEANING WOMAN, carrying her purse, is running towards them, tears already on her face. CLEANING WOMAN Don't hurt my husband, mister.       He not up to nothing. Frank lets the Cuban down gently and stands up. Dis- gusted with himself. Breathing hard, he leans back against the wall. The Cleaning Woman falls to her knees and hugs her husband protectively. FRANK I'm sorry. Frank steps away, rubs a hand through his hair, tries to collect himself. He's standing amidst dumpsters and discarded food boxes. He looks up and sees a marquee. RACHEL MARRON.   TONITE.   BENEFIT CONCERT.    8 P.M. 
145A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              145A Rachel is seated at her dressing table applying her makeup for the evening's performance. The telephone RINGS as she begins to work on her hair. RACHEL Fletcher? No response. RACHEL Baby, is that you? It's mommy, honey. DAN (V.O.) (eerily distorted) Guess again, whore! Fuck you and fuck Miami. I'm coming for you. I know where you are and I'm coming for you... 
Rachel is paralyzed by fear, unable to hang up the phone. 
146   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT              146 Frank comes in the front door. He's had it. Devaney, who has been sitting alone in the living room, stubs out a cigarette and stands to meet him. Frank doesn't pause. FRANK I'm through. I'll get you back to L.A. and that's it. The guy with Fletcher can cover you till you get a replacement. 
DEVANEY She got another call, while you were downstairs and she answered it herself. It was him, Frank. Same guy. FRANK (moving toward balcony) I don't care. DEVANEY Farmer, it really shook her up. She thought it was going to be Fletcher calling her from L.A. I think she'll be reasonable now. FRANK (across him) Save it, Devaney. The people who hire me don't have to be convinced to save their own lives. Frank reaches the sliding door that leads to the balcony. FRANK Call me when she's ready to go down. DEVANEY Farmer -- Frank goes out on the balcony and slides the door closed behind him. 
147   EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT                                       147 Frank looks out at the ocean. The breeze washes over his face. A huge brightly-lit yacht is sailing by, close to shore. Frank looks at it reflectively. 
He senses another presence and looks to his right. Rachel sits huddled in a balcony chair. The bright  moon- light illuminates her as she looks out to sea. She  is wearing one of her spectacular show gowns, her hair has been brushed, and her stage makeup has been applied.   But tonight it hasn't come together. It doesn't work.   She holds a cigarette and the breeze keeps it glowing.  This is the only time we've seen her smoke. RACHEL Farmer... Nothing that's happened between us matters... I understand now... You're going to have to believe me, because I'm not going to beg. 
She takes a long drag on her cigarette. RACHEL It wasn't what he said... it was the way he said it... he was so... Her voice cracks.   She stops and tries to compose herself. RACHEL I need you... I'm afraid... and I hate it. I hate my fear... (a beat) Please protect me... Protect Fletcher... If anything happened to him... Frank looks at her. Tears are destroying her elaborate stage makeup. She wipes them away with her hand. FRANK I can't protect you like this. It's impossible. The odds are on his side. RACHEL I'll do whatever you say. This is the first time Frank has ever heard Rachel say that. He studies her, then looks out at the ocean. FRANK I want to take you away for a while. Rachel nods. FRANK Somewhere people don't know about. She nods again, agreeing. 
FRANK No Spector or Devaney or Tony. He looks at her, reading her face for any hesitation. There is none. 
FRANK If you cross me up this time, I'll kill you myself. Rachel smiles, weakly but with obvious relief. 
148   EXT. HERB FARMER'S HOUSE (BEND, OREGON) - LAKE SIDE -      148 DAY 
156   INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                156 
HERB His mother was the same way. Rachel smiles at him, thinking, then looks through at Frank in the kitchen, still peering out of the windows. Nicki watches Rachel. 
157   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER                                   157 Herb delicately lifts  a chessboard from the top of a cabinet and walks it  over to the table: A half-finished game. He leans over   and blows on the pieces -- sending a small cloud of dust  into the air. HERB Come on, son, you can run but you can't hide. Herb pulls up a chair and smiles as Frank appears from the kitchen, a bowl of popcorn in his hand. Frank takes a place across from his dad by the fire. The others gather round. HERB Your move. Frank studies the board.   Rachel lowers her head into a cupped hand, fascinated. RACHEL How long has this game been going on? Frank picks up a knight, thinks, sets it back down. FRANK Three years. Nicki takes the bowl of popcorn and squats down with it beside Fletcher. Fletcher peers intently at the board as he chews on a handful. HERB He had me on the run there that first year. Frank picks up his rook, scratches his forehead with it. He turns to Fletcher. FRANK What do you think? Fletcher finishes a mouthful of popcorn, wipes his mouth. FLETCHER Knight to king-four. 
Frank, Herbert and Rachel turn in synch and stare at the boy. FRANK City kid. 
Herb pats his leg, gesturing to Fletcher to take a place on his lap. HERB Come over here, Fletcher, sit by me. Fletcher goes over and joins him. 
RACHEL Well, that's it for me, I'm going to bed. She rises. Frank follows her up the stairs.   Nicki watches them go. 
158   INT. UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT                                 158 Frank stops at the end of the hallway, checking the lock on the window, the little terrier is at his heels. Rachel pauses outside the door. Frank gestures for the dog to stay. The dog sits in the middle of the hallway looking from one to the other. For a few seconds neither speaks. Frank smiles. FRANK Good night, Rachel. Rachel accepts this. She smiles in return and touches him on the arm, very tenderly. RACHEL Good night, Frank. Rachel turns, goes to her room and closes the door. 
159   EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  159 Details are barely distinguishable in the fog. We hear the gentle LAPPING of the LAKEWATER against the dock. 
160   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                   160 Fletcher is asleep, snuggled on Herb's lap by the fire. Herb is also asleep. Frank fetches a blanket and gently 
covers them both.    He puts out the light. 
161   INT. ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT                              161 Frank steps quietly into the hall. Nicki is standing in the shadows. She watches as Frank goes through the ritual of locking the front door, several ways. NICKI (softly) You're very thorough. VARIOUS SHOTS - AROUND INTERIOR Frank makes a circuit through the rooms of the first floor, checking windows and doors. Nicki tags along. NICKI What's happening between you and Rachel? Frank glances at her. NICKI Come on. One minute she's got magnetic hands, the next she hates you. I can't figure out what it is now. FRANK You follow all her moves this closely? NICKI (smiling) It's a living. FRANK No, it isn't. He moves away into the next room.    She hesitates a moment, then follows. NICKI You think my life is pretty sickly, don't you? FRANK No. NICKI You must.    I do. Frank steps into a tight, dark, little window alcove, checks the windows. 
FRANK Why don't you change it? NICKI Is it that easy? Frank turns from the window to find Nicki blocking his exit. She moves close to him and kisses him, her hands on his shoulders. The kiss ends and they look at each other. FRANK You're a lovely woman. NICKI But you don't want me. 
Fletcher nods, his crying ends raggedly.   Frank begins to stand up. HENRY How do we get the boat back? Out in the center of the lake, the BOAT BLOWS UP.    Every- one on the dock jumps. 
Nicki screams. Frank sits down again. He shakes his head. On an impulse, he stretches out his hand, palm downward.   It's trembling slightly. 
162E   INT. BEDROOM - DAY                                          162E Rachel and Nicki hurriedly pack their bags.   Fletcher hovers nearby. 
162F   EXT. SHED/GARAGE - DAY 162F Frank slides out from under the van. The hood is up. Henry stands nearby. Frank goes to the driver's seat. FRANK (to Henry) Back off. Henry moves away from the van.   Frank inserts the key in the ignition. 
162G   EXT. PORCH - DAY                                            162G Herb comes out of the house, fast. His eyes scan the woods as he heads towards the shed. HERB Frank! Henry turns and motions to Herb to stay away. 
162H   INT. VAN - DAY                                              162H 
Frank takes a moment, then turns the key.    Nothing.   The van is dead. 
162-I   EXT. LAWN - DAY                                               162-I Henry and Herb watch.    Frank gets out of the van.   He walks to Herb. HERB Someone's cut the phone lines. It could be anywhere between here and town. FRANK Both the cars are dead. And I can't see how it was done. Frank and Herb exchange a look. FRANK Who could know we're here? This place has nothing to do with her. HERB Maybe it has to do with you. Frank looks at him. HERB We can't walk out of here at night with them. Frank shakes his head. FRANK We'll button down tonight and walk out at first light. 
162J    EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                     162J There is a light ground-mist. The moon shines down down brightly but the house is totally dark. 
162K    INT. HOUSE - MONTAGE - NIGHT                                  162K The terrier dog listens in the upstairs hallway. Herb watches from an upstairs window. Rachel lies in bed, clutching Fletcher tightly. 
164     INT. LIVING ROOM - MIDDLE OF NIGHT                            164 Frank has been sitting in a chair in the center of the living room for two hours. Listening. Now we listen 
with him. At first it seems silent, but slowly we become aware of a subtle symphony of sounds. An old house sur- rounded by WOODS. There are lots of NOISES. But they are regular, innocent. Frank is aware of a new noise, a gentle sobbing coming from nearby. He picks up his gun from the table beside him and goes into the kitchen. 
172B   INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                            172B Frank's head spins to Rachel's doorway, then immediately back to Herb. He starts to move towards the stairs, fast. FRANK (to Herb) Stay with Rachel! Henry's head appears round the doorway of Herb's room. 
173    INT. STAIRS - NIGHT                                        173 Frank is rapidly down the stairs, gun in hand. 
173A   INT. FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                           173A Frank finds Nicki's body slumped against the wall.   He checks her. She's dead. The door beyond is open.     The wind blows in. Outside it's foggy. FRANK (yelling) Dad? 
HERB (O.S.) We're okay! FRANK Stay with Rachel! The DOG continues to BARK upstairs. Frank sees a slight movement outside and window to his right. A split-second moment of decision. He heads off rapidly down the hall, away from the open door. 
175    EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  175 The fog is thick. Frank swiftly emerges from the back door and stops, dead still, listening. There is only the RUSTLING of TREES. 
175A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              175A Herb is by Rachel's bed. RACHEL What's happening? Where's Nicki? HERB Be quiet! 
175B   EXT. FARMER HOUSE - NIGHT                                  175B Frank listens. Suddenly he hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS, a body breaking through the bushes. Frank heads off towards the sound at a run. 
176    EXT. WOODS - NIGHT                                         176 INTERCUT - FRANK AND FIGURE 
The move fitfully through the eerie, beautiful scene. In and out of the fog. Stop, listen,  wait, go. Two wary, interchangeable animals. Frank  disappears into the fog. When the figure reappears,  Frank is moving faster, closing the gap. 
The figure, seen in CLOSEUP for the first time, is wear- ing a dark-colored ski mask.  His breath billows out of the mouth hole, whitening in the cool March air. He hears Frank APPROACHING and points his gun in the direction of the FOOTSTEPS.  He does not fire. SILENCE. Frank stops and rests on his haunches. Listening, he hears the intruder move. The sounds have stopped up ahead. Close. 
The figure peers into the fog, gun up.   He's ready, confident. He waits. Nothing. Frank, from his crouch, does something brand-new. He raises his gun into the fog in a two-handed grip, ready to fire. He holds it easily. And then he does something really strange: Frank closes his eyes. After a beat, we hear MOVEMENT. Frank, eyes still closed, swings his gun 15 degrees and FIRES TWO BLASTS. The man jumps away from a small tree that has splintered six inches from his shoulder. His eyes are wild behind his ski mask. Frightened, he suddenly crashes away in the opposite direction. We FOLLOW. There is ANOTHER SHOT from Frank very close to the man. 
176A   INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              176A Herb is at the window. There is anguish on his face as he hears the SHOTS. He wants to go to his son's aid but knows he cannot leave Rachel. Rachel and Fletcher are huddled in the bed, terrified. Fletcher clutches at the DOG, which is still BARKING. Henry stands by the bed, gun in hand. 
194   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT                                          194 Rachel's face as she watches Sandra Castle on the monitor. She is at a makeup table. MUSIC is LOUD. The celebrities in the Green Room are impressed with Sandra's performance. There is spontaneous applause. Rachel turns to the room. RACHEL I want that broad run out of town. 
195    INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                                    195 Frank calls Tony on his SURV-KIT. FRANK Tony, you there? 
TONY (O.S.) Yeah, Frank. FRANK Tony, I've got a feeling this is the night. I think he's gonna go for her in front of all the cameras. The kind of thing only a lunatic would do. That's how he wants it to look. Except he isn't a lunatic. He's very clever. I need you to help me. TONY (O.S.) I'm with you, Frank. There's no more competition between them. Three sound technicians appear at Frank's side, very agitated. TECHNICIAN (to Frank) You can't use that thing back here. The  breakthrough's killing our radio mikes... We'll have to disconnect you. Reluctantly, Frank disconnects his earpiece. 
195A   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT 195A Tony fiddles with his earpiece. TONY Frank?... Frank? Technicians approach Tony, too. 
195B   MONTAGE                                                   195B Big finish of song and dance number (total 40 seconds). Applause and dancers off. 
196   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT                                          196 Frank walks past Tony. Tony holds up the earpiece in frustration. Frank nods. He walks over to Rachel. He seems tense and she senses it. And like a tangible thing, his anxiety is passed over to her. She is frightened. RACHEL (spooked) What's wrong? Skip Thomas appears at her side. SKIP Rachel... Clive. Let's go, okay? Clive Healy comes over. Rachel must tear her eyes away from Frank. Tony floats up behind them. Skip regards him with irritation and turns to Frank. SKIP (indicating Tony) Really. Must we have everyone? We have our own men at the door. FRANK Tony stays. Skip looks at Rachel for a response. RACHEL Yes!    I want him. Skip shrugs.    Clive takes Rachel's arm. CLIVE Come, Rachel, let us brighten the firmament. Rachel forces a smile, but her eyes follow Frank as he starts to lead the way out of the Green Room. On an impulse, she reaches for something from the makeup table and presses it into her hand. It's the Russian Orthodox cross. She clutches it like a talisman and follows Frank. Tony brings up the rear. 
197   INT. BACKSTAGE AREA - NIGHT                                197 The group moves down the hall from the Green Room, past the stage right wings. Behind the scenery to the back of the stage. FRANK'S POV - STAGEHANDS 
in blue, celebrity guests, technicians. His eyes examine each curtain, corner and recess. He looks above him. CLOSEUP ON RACHEL'S FACE as she looks around nervously. HER BODY 
is tense on Clive's arm.   Clive pats her arm soothingly. CLIVE Try to relax, Rachel. I know you must be very excited. Skip leads them to a set of temporary stairs behind the scenery; they lead to the center of the top tier. Production aides with clipboards and headphones wait up there. THE CLOCK - 8:05 SKIP (pointing) Rachel, you'll go in there and Clive, you over there. You'll meet on the landing. They both nod, but Rachel is distracted, tense. SKIP Watch your step going down. Someone spilled some water. Clive and Rachel climb the stairs. Rachel turns once more to look anxiously at Frank. She clutches the cross but he doesn't see. Frank watches them ascend. He signals Tony to stay there until Rachel goes on. Frank moves off toward the stage left wings. ON TV MONITOR - we see Reardon, acting as Master of Ceremonies, doing the introductions. REARDON (V.O.) (on screen) I used to have an outfit just like that... And to present the Best Song award we have our debonair friend from England and the lady who has everything -- Clive Healy and Rachel Marron! A red camera light clicks on. MUSIC UP, APPLAUSE, as we see Clive and Rachel make their entrances on the TV monitor. 
198   INT. STAGE LEFT - NIGHT                                           198 Frank swiftly adjusts his position so he can still see the stage. As he does, he glances under the scaffolding that supports the set. 
199   INT. ON STAGE - NIGHT                                       199 Rachel and Clive reach the podium. Clive is all smiles. Rachel is trying, but is obviously distracted. FROM BEHIND THEM As the applause dies away, we see  what they see: TV cameras, an orchestra in the pit,  the huge audience, and the bright glare of the lights.   At the front of the podium is the transparent plastic  of the teleprompter; their lines can be clearly seen,  printed out and moving vertically. CLIVE (reading from the prompter) Well, Rachel, I know that you only came tonight to present this award and you'll want to leave as soon as we're done. Rachel's lines appear on the prompter, but she does not start reading them immediately. They stop moving on the screen. Rachel's face, her eyes darting about. There is an awful silence. 
RACHEL'S POV - BRIGHT RED LIGHT on the nearest TV camera. The teleprompter, now showing Clive's lines. The light. A man in the first row of the audience. CLOSE ON HER HANDS as they squeeze the cross. CLIVE (O.S.) Over the course of the evening we've heard five smashing songs and the names of the artists who created them. 
206   INT. ON STAGE - NIGHT                                          206 Clive, the professional, stands holding the envelope.         He glances off after Rachel, mystified. 
207   INT. STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                                 207 A cluster of people   surround Rachel, comforting her. Frank comes up. He    does not try to force his way through to Rachel. People    begin to move away, the cluster thins. Two stars move off   toward the back of the stage. STAR #1 I always said she was nuts.    I've always said that. Clive Healy comes up. CLIVE Is she all right? He is assured that she is.       Clive goes out to his seat 
in the audience. As the people move off, Rachel becomes clearly visible to Frank. Tony is standing next to her, but another man has his arm around Rachel, comforting her. Rachel's face is tear-stained and she dabs at it with a handkerchief. She is recovering fast. Past her fear, she is now very embarrassed. Her voice is strong. 
RACHEL Christ, what an idiot I am. Jesus. What the hell's the matter with me? Frank moves up closer, and exchanges looks with Tony, who is confused by Rachel's behavior. Rachel turns toward Frank and, in so doing, brings the man comforting her around to face Frank. It is Reardon. RACHEL Farmer, you've made me a raving lunatic. Frank barely hears Rachel, so struck is he   by Reardon's presence. Frank looks around them quickly    for Portman. Rachel looks at Frank with irritation and   turns back toward the Green Room. A production aide    signals Reardon. REARDON (to Rachel) I have to go back out.   Are you okay? RACHEL Thank you for your help, John. I'm fine. Rachel walks off toward the Green Room with Tony. Reardon starts to walk out toward the stage. Frank stops him. Reardon is irritated. FRANK Where's Portman? REARDON Who? FRANK Portman. REARDON (breaking away) Never heard of him. Reardon walks out on stage. Frank is left standing alone. All the weariness comes back, all his senses start to hum. Frank looks around, then moves off toward the Green Room. 
208   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT                                        208 Rachel sits at a makeup table.   Skip Thomas approaches, clipboard in hand. SKIP Rachel, I'm sorry, but if you're going to be in your seat for the Best Actress award, you've got to do it now. RACHEL Skip, I'm moving as fast as I can. For chrissake, go twitch somewhere else. 
Skip backs off.   Spector and Frank join the group. SPECTOR Honey, everything's fine. No one noticed anything. Everybody in this building is ready to jump out of their skin from nerves. RACHEL Bullshit, you saw me. Farmer's made me a raving lunatic -- FRANK Something's going on you should know about -- SPECTOR You're making her crazy.   You're making us all crazy. FRANK Rachel, I know who it is. He's here tonight. I think he's... RACHEL Shut up... This is the last straw. She throws down the powder and stands up fast, makeup and purse flying. The powder com- pact bursts over the cross lying on the table. Everyone in the Green Room looks at her. RACHEL (hissing at him) Shut up, you maniac! You never stop. Now you've made an ass of me in front of a billion people. And you won't quit. They stare at each other and everyone else stares at them. 
Rachel walks swiftly out the door of the Green Room. Frank sits for a moment, then stands up. The bodyguard follows his charge to the door. He whispers hurriedly at Tony as they leave. FRANK Tony, it's Portman.   Remember?   The guy from Miami... Spector grabs Tony's sleeve, pulling him back. SPECTOR After tonight, you're back in charge. TONY What? SPECTOR He knows nothing about show business. Tony squares off with Spector. TONY You are an asshole. 
209   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                     209 Reardon is just introducing TOM WINSTON, the actor who will announce the Best Actress award. BEST ACTRESS INTRO (TOTAL 1 MINUTE) (Reardon back on stage to applause, Reardon linking material (maybe gags.) Reardon intros Winston. Play on Winston to applause.) 
210   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - AISLE                             210 REARDON Presenting the Best Actress award, we have the man who last year received the top honor an actor can achieve for his performance in "South Of Waco". Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Winston! APPLAUSE Frank watches, his eyes scanning, searching the vast theatre, squinting as he tries to see beyond the glare of the klieg lights and the cameras. WINSTON Thank you, John, thank you, Academy. 
It brings back some great memories to be standing here again. Last year I figured something out. While it is a great honor to be nominated, actually winning caps the evening very pleasantly. 
LAUGHTER WINSTON on stage, speaking and then listing the nominees. FRANK'S POV - RACHEL, DEVANEY AND SPECTOR in their seats, up the aisle toward the back of the theatre, high into the gloom of the balcony. ANGLE ON STAGE WINSTON Tonight we give this award not to the best actress, but to the best performance by one of five exquisitely talented artists... FRANK'S FACE - searching. TV CAMERA - focused on the audience.    Its red light goes on. ON SCREEN Rachel's face, expectant, nervous on the screen. FRANK'S POV - THE PATH Rachel would have to take to the stage, the steps to the stage, the faces of the ushers near the stage, the conductor, ready to play theme music. WINSTON (O.S.) ...And the nominees for best performance by an actress in a leading role are -- Constance Simpson for Hot and Cold... BACK TO SCENE APPLAUSE. Frank slips through the curtained doorway that leads to the backstage. WINSTON (O.S.) ...Ellen Pearson for Maybe Soon... More APPLAUSE. 
211   INT. BACKSTAGE - STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                211 Frank comes up swiftly. He stops behind a curtain, six feet from the path the winner will take. Tony is there. Frank speaks to him and, as he does, he puts a hand on Tony's arm. They both look across the stage, past Winston into the wings on the other side. FRANK'S POV In the wings of the opposite side of the stage, half hidden by a curtain, a TV cameraman is hoisting his lightweight portable camera onto his shoulder. His back is to us. 
216   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                                 216 CLOSE ON PORTMAN 
Totally calm and, as he gambled, invisible in the commo- tion. Camera still on his shoulder, he slowly backs away from the scene. Ushers and uniformed security men rush past him towards the stage. People leap from their seats. A woman screams piercingly behind him. Portman doesn't blink. 
217   INT. STAGE - NIGHT                                         217 Dozens more helpers pour onto the stage around Frank and Rachel. Rachel starts to rise on all fours and sees, as hands reach out to help her, the blood on Frank's shirt. He has taken the hits for her. But he's still on the job, gaze alert. Without taking his eyes from the audi- torium, his left arm stretches out, with some pain, to push Rachel back down. The right arm, gun in hand, sweeps the auditorium. Where is Portman? Frank can't see past the mob. Ushers fall on Frank in a heap, trying to disarm him. Security men try to pull them off. Rachel shouts, trying to make herself heard above the noise. RACHEL He's my bodyguard. Get off him! He's O.K... FRANK'S POV - SERIES OF SHOTS A SERIES of SWIFT LOW ANGLE SHOTS through legs and faces. One brief glimpse that could be Portman. A cameraman turns. It's not. Frank is desperate, pushing away a helping arm. The chaos mounts. SIRENS WAIL outside. 
218   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                               218 CLOSE ON PORTMAN He turns away from the stage as four cops pound past him. He walks away. Suddenly, for one brief second, his face loses its composure as he looks to the side door. PORTMAN'S POV Hysterical audience members jostle for the exit, screaming and shouting. It's like a football scrum. Cops and secur- ity men pushing and pulling. His escape route is blocked. CLOSE ON FRANK'S FACE - HIS EYES Briefly glimpsed through blurred, frenzied, f.g.   Still seeking his target, biting his lip in pain. PORTMAN 
Cool again, he turns back to the stage, seeking an alternative escape route, camera still providing cover. 
219   INT. ON STAGE - WINGS - NIGHT                             219 
A lumbering figure, blood streaming from one eye, his .38 drawn and outstretched. It's Tony staggering to the edge of the stage, straight towards his attacker. TONY (bellowing) Frank! Frank! Over here! ON STAGE 
Frank and Rachel's heads swivel in unison at the sound, looking towards the far aisle. PORTMAN Against the side wall at the front, Portman's eyes desperately scan for the source of the voice. He sees Tony, his pistol takes aim. FRANK'S POV For a split second, two running figures f.g. pass and cross leaving a momentary clear line to Portman. ON STAGE Frank FIRES.   ONCE.   TWICE. PORTMAN Frank's bullets hit home. The first slams Portman in the chest, knocking him against the wall. The second hits the CAMERA on his shoulder, EXPLODING it around his face. FEMALE ACADEMY MEMBER Blood spatters her white Armani dress and the shirt- front of her escort. Portman's body slumps forward in her lap, pinning her back in her seat. He's dead. His pistol drops onto a pair of shiny, black leather pumps. ON STAGE Frank holds his aim steady, reluctant to look away. He half turns to Rachel, wincing with the effort. She's unhurt. He has fulfilled his promise to her. Rachel throws her arms around Frank and hugs him, tears streaming down her cheeks. 
Frank Farmer's face. Sad and weary. His guard is finally down. Nothing more can happen. He slowly lowers the gun, closes his eyes and lets his head fall onto his chest. 
ANGLE ON SPECTOR 
In the midst of the commotion of medics, security men, police and ushers, Spector bends down and gently retrieves the gold envelope and the card bearing Rachel's name. There are splatters of blood on it. He tries to wipe them off with the silk handkerchief from his breast pocket. 
220   EXT. THE PANTAGES THEATRE - NIGHT                          220

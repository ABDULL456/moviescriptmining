1   EXT. SKY - DAY                                              1 
Fluffy white CLOUDS drift across a clear blue sky. 
TITLE CARD- "This really happened" 
FADE TO WHITE: 
TITLE CARD- "It really did" 
A dull WHINE is heard building in volume until finally- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
2   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY    2 
Startled, STEVEN RUSSELL (40) opens his eyes. Gaunt and pale, he seems to be on death's door. The whine we once heard is now the high-pitched ALARM of medical equipment. 
The door BURSTS open. NURSES enter, rushing toward him. 
The nurses pass him and attend to the PATIENT in the next bed over, frantically administering CPR. 
SUPER: "TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY INFIRMARY - 1998" 
A DOCTOR appears and pushes the nurses aside. 
DOCTOR Where's the crash cart!? 
He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard- the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard. 
Steven returns his gaze to the ceiling. A CHEERY VOICE counterpoints the bleakness of this scene. 
STEVEN (V.O.) (upbeat and happy) Love sure is a funny thing... It makes you happy. Makes you sad. Makes you do all sorts of things you never thought you'd do before. Love's the reason I'm here actually.

3   EXT. MARSHLAND - CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY              3 
A group of FOUR NINE YEAR OLDS lie in the grass atop a hill. They stare up at the clouds, playfully arguing. 
RED HAIRED BOY I still don't see it. 
LITTLE GIRL It's right there. 
A young STEVEN RUSSELL (9) is among them. 
YOUNG STEVEN It's really big. 
STEVEN'S MOM (O.S.) Steeeeeeeeeven... 
Steven looks down the hill to see his mother calling. 
STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D) Steeeeeeeeeven... 
4   INT. LIVING ROOM CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY              4 
Young Steven sits in the middle of the couch. His PARENTS and 11 year old BROTHER stand before him. He stares at them- innocent and doe-eyed with a big smile on his face. 
STEVEN'S MOM Are you a happy little boy Steven? 
Steven smiles and nods. 
STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D) You've always been such a happy little boy. (then) Now Steven, we want to tell you something very important, but I want you to understand that it doesn't change a thing. 
Steven awaits, smiling. 
STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D) We're still gonna love you, you're still gonna be our happy little boy and you're still gonna-- 
STEVEN'S BROTHER You're adopted. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08     3. 
YOUNG STEVEN Shut up! 
He glares at his brother, then turns back to his mother. Her face says it all. 
STEVEN'S MOM It's true. 
WHACK! She SWATS his brother in the head. Steven starts putting things together. 
STEVEN'S MOM (CONT'D) Your brother overheard your Dad and I talking and well, we didn't want you to hear it from anybody but us. (then) It's true. You're a special little boy. You know why? Because we chose you. Not like your brother here who's natural. 
STEVEN I'm absolutely bushed. 
DEBBIE Me too. 
They turn on their sides, back to back in the bed. After a few moments of SILENCE, Steven rolls over and puts his arm around her, gently feeling her breasts. 
Debbie turns on her back and they kiss quietly as Steven quietly gets on top. In moments, they are rocking with the gentle rhythm of everyday sex. 
Just as things are peaking, Steven suddenly STOPS and strikes a conversational tone. 
STEVEN Deb- You know how, as a cop, I have lots of access? You know- records and things? 
DEBBIE (surprised) Steven- 
STEVEN (oblivious) Now do you think it's, you know, unethical, to use that to find my mother? "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages    5-23-08   7. 
Debbie quickly realizes where his head is at. 
DEBBIE Oh... that.   Yeah, um, well I don't know- 
STEVEN I swear honey- getting around the system's so easy. No one would even know I did it. 
DEBBIE I know you want to find her Steven, but you need to think about this. 
STEVEN You're right, I shouldn't have done it. 
DEBBIE You did it!? Oh my God, Steven- what'd you find? 
Steven shrugs. 
STEVEN I haven't looked. It's downstairs. 
DEBBIE Really? Well let's go! 
She moves to get up. Steven takes umbrage. 
STEVEN Well hold on- let me finish. 
DEBBIE Oh, right. 
Steven thrusts and tenses. 
STEVEN There- that's got it. 
10   INT. STEVEN AND DEBBIE'S HOUSE 1984 - DINING ROOM - NIGHT 10 
Steven flips through the file box, reading through various pages. Debbie watches with compassion as he reads. Eventually he cracks an incredulous SMILE. 
DEBBIE What? 
STEVEN She's right here. She's been right here all this time. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08     8. 
DEBBIE It's really her? 
STEVEN Yeah. No question. 
DEBBIE My goodness Steven, that's wonderful. 
He reads on, his smile ever widening until- 
He comes across something that concerns him and his voice trails off. His smile fades, replaced by a look of dread. 
Debbie grows concerned. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) What? What is it? Steven? 
He cannot believe his eyes. 
11   EXT. BASCOMBE HOME, VIRGINIA, 1984 - DAY                    11 
Steven walks up to a middle class home and raps on the screen door. A kindly woman (MRS. BASCOMBE) arrives behind the mesh wearing a birthday PARTY HAT. 
MRS. BASCOMBE (alarmed) Is something wrong officer? 
STEVEN Are you Barbra Bascombe? 
MRS. BASCOMBE Yes. Is something wrong? Is someone hurt? 
STEVEN (lip quivering) In a manner of speaking, yes. You gave up a baby for adoption, correct? 
An ashen look overcomes Mrs. Basham's face. She removes her hat. 
MRS. BASCOMBE I don't think I know what you're talking about. 
Steven can see that behind her is a small FAMILY GATHERING at the table, grouped around a BIRTHDAY CAKE. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   9. 
STEVEN Elizabeth City? St Jude's Hospital? Remember? 
MRS. BASCOMBE I don't know what you're talking about. 
Amidst the moonlit shadows, the THUMPING of VIGOROUS LOVEMAKING is heard. It continues, getting louder and louder until we make out two forms doing it doggie-style in the bed. 
Building to the climax, Steven moans with pleasure. 
STEVEN I'm gonna come, I'm gonna come... 
Suddenly we see the face of the MOUSTACHED MAN he's fucking. 
MOUSTACHED MAN DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS! 
SMASH CUT TO: 
14   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 14 
We are back with Steven in his hospital bed at the Penitentiary. 
STEVEN (V.O.) Oh did I forget to mention I was gay? Yeah, sorry about that. I'm gay. Gay, gay, gay, gay, gay. Have been as long as I can remember... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
15   EXT. MARSHLAND - CHESAPEAKE BAY, VA - 1966 - DAY           15 
WE'RE BACK on the hilltop from the beginning of the movie. 
Nine year old Steven and his three young FRIENDS crest the verdant hill- running and laughing through the backlit dandelion fluff of an idyllic summer day. 
They all collapse into the long grass like the splayed arms of a starfish. Catching their breath, they stare up at the sky- searching for shapes in the clouds. 
LITTLE GIRL I see a pony! What do you see!? "I Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages   5-23-08     13. 
LITTLE BOY I see a diesel train! 
RED HAIRED BOY I see a whirlybird! 
YOUNG STEVEN I see a wiener. 
They look at him with incredulity. 
RED HAIRED BOY What?! What kind of wiener? 
YOUNG STEVEN A man's wiener. 
LITTLE BOY Shut up! There's no wiener! 
YOUNG STEVEN Uh huh! 
RED HAIRED BOY No there's not! 
There is a long silence.   Then- 
LITTLE GIRL Oh I see it. There it is! 
YOUNG STEVEN Told ya... 
And as the other boys squint closely... 
STEVEN (V.O.) Anyway where was I? Oh yeah-- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
16   INT. HOUSTON BEDROOM - 1986 - NIGHT                        16 
Once again, the MOUSTACHED MAN throws his head back in the throes of lust. 
MOUSTACHED MAN DO IT MAN! COME IN MY ASS! 
Steven drives it home. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   14. 
STEVEN (V.O.) (matter of fact) And I did. 
17   EXT. HOUSTON APARTMENT DOORWAY, 1986 - LATER THAT NIGHT     17 
The Moustached Man and Steven say goodbye at the door. 
STEVEN (V.O.) I had been living a lie for a long, long time. I tend to do that... hide things. 
MOUSTACHED MAN You be careful out there, you're a little drunk. 
18   EXT. HOUSTON STREET - 1986 - NIGHT                          18 
Steven drives his red Corvette, hard top removed, with a contented look on his face. He glows as the Pet Shop Boys' "West End Girls" plays on the radio. 
STEVEN (V.O.) Now just because I was screwing around doesn't mean I didn't love Debbie. I did. I loved her with all my heart... Stephanie too. My family was all I had and they needed me. So I told myself it was just a little lie and it was better for everybody if it stayed that way. (beat) That's what I told myself. But life has a way of forcing these things into the light. 
CRASH! A CROSSING PICKUP TRUCK smashes into the driver side door-- violently propelling steven and his corvette out of frame. 
STEVEN (V.O.) You might even call it an epiphany. 
19   OMITTED                                                     19 
STEVEN Thank you. 
With great difficulty, Steven gets on his crutches and makes his exit. 
STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) Now it didn't happen all at once. It was sort of a gradual thing... 
28   EXT. GROCERY RECEIVING DOCK - MIAMI, 1992 - DAY             28 
An OLD WAREHOUSE MANAGER emerges from a darkened AMITY FOODSERVICE trailer with a crate of tomatoes in hand. As he steps out onto the dock, he passes Steven, who is talking with a 500 pound PRODUCE MANAGER. 
Tomato crates are all around. 
STEVEN (V.O.) It started with work. Tomatoes. I used to buy low grade tomatoes in the field and sell them to clueless chain stores as higher grade. 
PRODUCE MANAGER These are gorgeous. U.S-1 right? 
STEVEN (big smile) Finest in the land... 
And as they talk- 
STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) It's called `field buying'. I could clear three thousand dollars in a good week doing that. But frankly it wasn't enough. 
29   INT. MIAMI JEWELRY STORE - MIAMI 1992 - DAY                 29 
Steven stands before a SALESPERSON at a counter. 
SALESWOMAN Cash or charge? 
STEVEN Charge... 
Steven flips through a handful of identical CREDIT CARDS. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages     5-23-08   19. 
STEVEN (CONT'D) (sotto) Steven A Russell, Steven G Russell, Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven M Russell, Doctor Steven J Russell... (seeing one he likes) Ah! 
He gives a card to a smiling SALESWOMAN. 
SALESWOMAN Thank you... (reading card) ...Mister Evans. Can I see some ID? 
STEVEN Of course. 
And as Steven riffles through an equally large stack of DRIVER'S LICENSES... 
30   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - MIAMI 1992 - DAY                      30 
Steven stands atop a escalator, looking around. 
STEVEN (V.O.) But when money got really tight, the slip and fall always came in handy. 
He throws himself down the escalator, out of frame to the floor below. Painful tumbling is heard. 
At the BOTTOM of the escalator a hard THUD is heard.      A beat later, Steven's feet slide into frame. 
31   INT. PALM BEACH APARTMENT - 1992 - LIVING ROOM - MORNING 31 
CHRISTMAS MUSIC. 
Dressed in pajamas, Steven and Kemple sit cross-legged at the base of their Christmas Tree, surrounded by torn paper and strewn gifts. Steven's arm is in a cast. 
Kemple opens a hinged case to reveal a GOLD Rolex watch. 
KEMPLE Oh wow... 
STEVEN What do you think? Yes? "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages       5-23-08   20. 
KEMPLE Well Steven it's beautiful.     It really is. 
STEVEN You don't like it. 
KEMPLE No, no, no.   I do. 
STEVEN You don't like it. 
KEMPLE I'm menstruating. Don't listen to me. 
STEVEN Tell me what's wrong with it.        Is it the gold? 
KEMPLE Well... 
STEVEN That's why I got you the stainless! 
He takes out another box and hands it to Kemple. 
KEMPLE Steven! 
As he opens it, Steven grabs the gold Rolex. 
STEVEN The gold one is for me, dipshit. 
Kemple smiles broadly as he admires his new watch. 
He continues to CRY uncontrollably as he raises a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE and dumps all the pills into his mouth. He reaches into the back seat and pulls out a bottle of Galliano to wash it down. 
He starts up the car. 
STEVEN (V.O.) Yep. Everything was gonna be just fine. 
36    EXT. ROAD - FLORIDA 1992 - DAY                              36 
CARS PASS through frame, quickly heading wherever it is they are going. Moments later, a car horn is heard, incessantly blaring and building in volume until-- 
STEVEN'S CAR IDLES INTO FRAME AT 1 MPH. The Heights', "How Do You Talk To An Angel" is barely audible over the car horn and STEVEN is slumped over the steering wheel. 
Moments later, it veers off down into the grassy shoulder and out of frame. 
FADE OUT. 
37    INT. PALM BEACH HOSPITAL - 1992 - MORNING                   37 
Steven awakes in a hospital bed. He looks around and eventually looks through the observation glass into the hallway. He sees Debbie talking to a COP. "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   24. 
KEMPLE (O.S.) Hey... 
He readjusts to see Jimmy sitting nearby. 
STEVEN (bleary) Sorry. 
KEMPLE Why didn't you tell me? 
STEVEN I can't go to prison, Jimmy. I can't. I can't go to prison. I can't. I can't... 
KEMPLE Okay-okay calm down. It's okay. I just want to tell them you're awake and we can take it from there. 
Confident that Steven is calm, Jimmy steps into the hall. 
38   INT. PALM BEACH HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - 1992 - CONTINUOUS         38 
Jimmy joins Debbie and the Cop in the hallway.    Steven is visible in bed through the glass. 
DEBBIE Did you know Steven was wanted? 
KEMPLE Not until just now. 
DEBBIE He likes to keep little secrets sometimes. 
KEMPLE Like the fact that he was a big queer? 
DEBBIE Yeah, like that. 
KEMPLE But suicide, my god. 
DEBBIE Well he does tend to overreact. 
KEMPLE I feel like I don't even know him. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   25. 
DEBBIE Well Jimmy, that's the thing. I'm not really sure he knows who he is. He's searching, at least that's how I figure it. I'm just not sure he knows what it is he's looking for. 
KEMPLE (to cop) Can you tell me exactly what he did? 
As they CONTINUE TO TALK, they fail to notice Steven getting out of bed and looking around blearily. 
He picks up a bedpan, reaches into his gown and absent- mindedly PISSES-- missing the pan completely. 
COP He has several warrants out in Texas. Fraud, forgery, embezzlement... 
DEBBIE What? 
KEMPLE I should have known... I should have said something. 
DEBBIE Don't blame yourself Jimmy... I did the same thing. There were always signs. I should have known he was gay when he started shaving his chest. 
KEMPLE That would be a warning sign... 
DEBBIE And all that Peter Allen music on his Walkman. 
KEMPLE Denial is a powerful thing. I don't feel so bad now. 
DEBBIE I just never thought. But now stealing? 
KEMPLE He's probably been doing it for years.    I say to myself he did it just to buy me things but I don't think that's true. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08    26. 
DEBBIE It's bigger than that. I'm sure. 
KEMPLE But why then? 
DEBBIE And why suicide? I mean- just like that? 
After that, he dresses and walks out the door behind them. 
KEMPLE I know- he seemed so happy and-- 
STEVEN (CONT'D) Let me introduce you to the mail guy. His name's Gary. 
45   EXT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY BREEZEWAY, 1995 - DAY            45 
A mean-looking con named GARY mans a mail-cart while he talks with Steven and Arnie. 
GARY (mid-sentence) ...letters, magazines, shit like that- it all goes through unmolested. But if Grandma's sending you cookies, or porn or brownies or whatever-- you're gonna have to pay for it if you wanna get it. Five bucks per item or you can suck my dick. 
Steven turns to Arnie. 
STEVEN Your choice. 
46   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY CELL BLOCK - 1995 - DAY          46 
Steven and Arnie arrive at the doorway of their cell. 
STEVEN Well that's about it. You're gonna be fine. Don't worry. And if you need anything you just let me know. Alright? 
Arnie thinks a moment. 
ARNIE So, uh, do I need to suck your dick? "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   30. 
STEVEN That'd be great. 
Steven gently shoves his new cellmate into the cell. 
47   INT. TX STATE PEN - PHONE BANK/COMMON AREA - 1995 - DAY     47 
Steven is on one of the many pay phones. 
DEBBIE (O.S.) Hi this is Debbie and Steffie. Sorry we missed you. Leave a message. God Bless! 
BEEP. 
STEVEN Hey Debbie. Hi Sweetheart. Sorry I missed you. I thought one o'clock was our time but maybe not. I sure miss you guys. Thanks for the picture and the article. Sometimes it's just nice to know there's someone out there who still cares about me since Jimmy left and all. So... uh... 
Steven is holding the stainless steel ROLEX he gave Kemple as a gift. He regards it wistfully. 
STEVEN (CONT'D) (thinking, drifting) Do you think I broke his heart? (snapping out of it) Sorry. Sometimes I forget it's just the machine... I'll try you again next time. One O'clock. Don't forget. 
He hangs up. Bored and lonely, he has a moment of repose. Just then, a loud RUCKUS across the COMMON AREA gets his attention. 
Steven watches as a group of ROWDY PRISONERS throw whatever they can find at a small BIRD as it flies around, trapped in the cavernous hall. 
The men LAUGH and HOOT as the bird is struck down and lies motionless on the ground. 
As the prisoners resume their activities, Steven notices a GENTLE LOOKING INMATE approaching the bird. 
Rapt, Steven watches as the inmate sympathetically scoops up the bird and walks off. Steven is quite taken. 
CUT TO: "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   31. 
48   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY - LAW LIBRARY - 1995 - DAY       48 
The gentle inmate, PHILLIP MORRIS, is a slightly built, handsome blonde boy-man. He struggles to reach a book on a high shelf. Helpless and irresistible, he is surprised when Steven reaches in to help retrieve the book. 
Their eyes lock and they stare in a short silence, until- 
PHILLIP (slightly Blanche DuBois) Thanks. Guess I need a few extra inches. 
STEVEN Glad to help. How's the bird? 
PHILLIP Huh? (realizing) Oh. Him, yeah... he's at peace. 
STEVEN Oh, I'm sorry. 
PHILLIP It was for the best. He was suffering. 
Steven acknowledges his kindness with a smile. 
STEVEN (referring to law book) Civil law? You know, I'm an attorney. 
PHILLIP Really? 
STEVEN You suing someone? 
PHILLIP I don't know what I'm doing. There's a guy I know- he's in the infirmary now. He's sick- he's real sick... AIDS. I thought maybe I could find a way to get him some help- I mean real help. Not here. I don't know- maybe I could-- I don't even know what I'm looking for... 
Steven is intrigued. 
STEVEN Does he have a lawyer? "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   32. 
PHILLIP Yeah. 
STEVEN Have him get in touch with the Prisoner Rights Committee. They deal with this all the time- pro bono. I've got the number. 
PHILLIP Well thank you, I-- 
STEVEN My name's Steven Russell. 
STEVEN Good... 
Phillip turns to walk away and hides his giddyness. 
50   INT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY - MICHAEL UNIT, 1995 - DAY           50 
Phillip passes the cells of Michael Unit, clutching his belongings and soon enters his cell. He looks around sheepishly until he is interrupted- 
CLEAVON (O.S.) You Phillip? 
Phillip turns to see CLEAVON- a huge black inmate mopping the hall outside his cell 
PHILLIP Yes. 
He tosses Phillip a folded note.      He catches it and looks at it with a smile. 
PHILLIP (CONT'D) Already? 
Phillip opens it up. As he reads, his face brightens considerably. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08    36. 
STEVEN (V.O.) Phillip, hope your new place is nice. Nice enough anyway. I hope the chocolate made it to you okay. Check the T.P. 
Phillip looks at the spare roll of toilet paper and turns it over. A small chocolate bar is stuck in the tube. 
STEVEN (V.O.) I hope you try to make some new friends and not be too shy. I guess I should tell you a little bit about myself... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
51   INT. TX STATE PEN - MICHAEL UNIT - PHILLIP'S CELL - DAY     51 
OPEN CLOSE ON a note as Phillip scrawls it. 
PHILLIP (V.O.) Dear Steven. I keep thinking about you saying I'm shy. I guess you're right, but I don't feel shy around you. I think that means something... 
As his VO continues, Phillip folds up the paper and passes it through the bars back to Cleavon. 
52   INT./EXT. TX STATE PENITENTIARY, 1995 (MONTAGE)             52 
VARIOUS SHOTS as we follow the note being passed by different hands and means throughout the prison on its way to Steven. 
PHILLIP (V.O.) Anyway thanks for the chocolate, but I should tell you I'm diabetic so I probably shouldn't... but I did anyway. It's been so long since anyone's shown me any kindness and well, it means a lot. I just wish you were here... 
53   INT. TX STATE PEN, 1995 - STEVEN'S CELL - CONTINUOUS        53 
Steven reads the letter on his bunk. 
PHILLIP (V.O.) ...Write me back soon. Phillip. 
Steven finishes the letter and folds it up, looking strangely expressionless. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   37. 
54   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - DAY           54 
Phillip peers out of his cell to see Cleavon working his way nearer with his mop. He's giddy. 
Moments later, Cleavon passes him by. Phillip is bummed. 
55   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - NEXT DAY      55 
Again Phillip watches as Cleavon passes his cell without leaving a note. 
56   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - NEXT DAY      56 
Phillip lays in bed, impatiently. He seems upset. He anxiously peers out the bars and catches a glimpse of the mopping Cleavon working his way closer to his cell. 
PHILLIP Hurry up would you? 
CLEAVON I ain't no motherfucking DHL, faggot. Besides I ain't got nothing for you anyway... 
PHILLIP But it's been three days. 
CLEAVON You got a tracking number, motherfucker? 
PHILLIP No. 
CLEAVON Then shut your faggot ass. 
Phillip slumps back onto his bed, depressed. 
PHILLIP Congratulations Phillip, scared off another one. 
A few moments later, he's startled by the CLANG of his cell door sliding open. 
He looks up - a CORRECTIONS OFFICER stands over him. 
CORRECTIONS OFFICER Morris - you got a new roommate. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08   38. 
This is no consolation to Phillip. He heaves a heavy sigh until he sees STEVEN enter his cell, clutching a pile of belongings. 
Phillip is overwhelmed as the cell door slams shut behind Steven. 
PHILLIP Get up... 
Steven sits up. 
PHILLIP (CONT'D) Did you pay to have the Screecher beat up? 
STEVEN Me? 
PHILLIP Don't bullshit me. Did you pay to have him beat up? "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages    5-23-08   41. 
STEVEN Well you said he bothered you. 
PHILLIP Just answer me. 
STEVEN Yeah. Yeah, I did. 
PHILLIP Steven... 
A tear comes to Phillip's eye. 
PHILLIP (CONT'D) This is the most romantic thing anyone's ever done for me. 
He clamps onto Steven and hugs with all his life. 
STEVEN I just want you to be happy, baby. 
PHILLIP You are so amazing!!! 
And as they roll on the bed playfully... 
62   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - CLEAVON'S CELL - NIGHT        62 
CLEAVON lays on his cot staring at the ceiling. Eventually a hand enters through the bars holding a cassette tape. 
PHILLIP (O.S.) Cleavon- put this in. 
CLEAVON No man- not now. 
PHILLIP (O.S.) It's important. 
CLEAVON How important? 
Phillip's hand disappears for a moment and comes back with a FIVE DOLLAR BILL. 
CLEAVON (CONT'D) Ten. "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages   5-23-08   42. 
PHILLIP (O.S.) Fine. But you gotta play the whole thing. 
CLEAVON Yeah, alright. 
PHILLIP (O.S.) Promise? 
CLEAVON Fuck you- my word's my bond motherfucker. 
Cleavon takes the cash and puts the tape in a BOOM BOX. 
A familiar romantic TUNE begins to play... 
CLEAVON (CONT'D) Fuck man- Johnny Mathis? Fucking white- ass nigger... 
He buries his head in the pillow as "Chances Are" plays. 
63   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - PHILLIP'S CELL - NIGHT         63 
As the MUSIC seeps into their dark cell, Steven reads a LAW BOOK by pen light. Phillip grabs Steven's hand and tries to pull him off the bed. 
PHILLIP C'mon... 
STEVEN What? 
PHILLIP C'mon. Dance. 
STEVEN No. No... I can't dance. 
PHILLIP Yes you can. 
STEVEN No I can't. I'm serious... 
PHILLIP Honey, you're queer- it comes with the package. 
STEVEN Well not me. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages      5-23-08   43. 
PHILLIP C'mon, I'll show you... 
He drags him up and begins his lesson. 
PHILLIP (CONT'D) Hold me here... and here. Okay watch... 
Steven stumbles his way through the slow dance for a while, but with Phillip's help he begins to settle in. 
68A   EXT. TEXAS STATE PEN BREEZEWAY, 1995 - MORNING             68A 
Phillip runs after Steven, quickly arriving at a LOCKED GATE. Steven is on the other side, still being escorted away. Phillip is forced to find an alternative route. 
69    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - COMMON AREA - CONTINUOUS      69 
Phillip marches through the common area, fighting tears. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages    5-23-08     46. 
70   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - M BLOCK - CONTINUOUS           70 
Phillip runs through another cell block until he comes to a window. He looks outside. 
PHILLIP Steven! 
71   EXT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - SALLY PORT - CONTINUOUS        71 
PHILLIP'S POV: Steven is waiting in line with some other prisoners to board a bus. 
Phillip can be seen through the small window, but he fails to get Steven's attention. 
He bangs silently on the glass. 
72   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - M BLOCK - CONTINUOUS           72 
Phillip continues in vain to get Steven's attention. 
PHILLIP STEVEN!! STEVEN! 
He sees the line at the sally port start to move and stops to think. He knows what he has to do. 
73   EXT. TX STATE PEN BREEZEWAY, 1995 - YARD GATE - DAY         73 
Phillip runs down a breezeway. Eventually he reaches a heavily populated gate, manned by a YARD GUARD. 
PHILLIP I wanna go in the yard. 
YARD GUARD You do? 
PHILLIP I WANNA GO IN THE YARD! 
YARD GUARD Hold your horses Dorothy. 
The Yard Guard pushes a button that opens the gate and Phillip bursts through. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages    5-23-08   47. 
74   EXT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1995 - YARD - DAY                     74 
Phillip runs through the yard, passing GIANT WOLF- WHISTLING INMATES as they put down their weights and stop their basketball games. 
Phillip maintains his focus on the sally port on the other side of the far fence. 
PHILLIP STEVEN!!!! 
Boarding the bus, Steven hears him and turns. Delighted, he's forced on board by a Guard before he can respond. 
PHILLIP (CONT'D) STEVEN! 
Steven gets in his seat and yells out the window. 
STEVEN What the hell are you doing!? 
PHILLIP I love you! 
STEVEN I love you too! 
VROOM! The bus starts up and begins to move. 
STEVEN (CONT'D) We'll be together soon! I promise! 
The bus drives off. Phillip runs along with it for a while as they share a long goodbye. And eventually, the bus disappears from view. 
Phillip clings to the fence a moment, hanging on to hope. He slumps and turns- 
-only to find himself confronted by several HULKING MEMBERS OF THE ARYAN BROTHERHOOD with one thing on their minds. 
Phillip marches right toward them and as he draws close- 
PHILLIP GET THE FUCK OUTTA MY WAY!!! 
Startled, they split to let Phillip pass unmolested. "I Love You Phillip Morris"      Green Pages   5-23-08   48. 
75   INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 75 
Back in the present, Steven remains in his hospital bed at the Penitentiary Infirmary. 
STEVEN (V.O.) Those were the longest three months of my life. I wrote to Phillip every day until I got released. 
76   EXT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY, 1995 - SALLY PORT - DAY       76 
CLANG!   The gate of the prison closes behind Steven as he exits.   He approaches a waiting TAXI. 
A PARTY to celebrate Phillip's release. Steven and Phillip stand at the door as FRIENDS file in and greet him boisterously. 
BAYLOR Phillllip!     It's so good to see you... 
Another friend enters. 
BLAKE Oh my God! You look great. Prison agreed with you. How do I get on that diet? 
PHILLIP Oh you couldn't handle it- not unless we smuggled an espresso machine in a cake. 
BLAKE Throw in a Sicilian Barista and I'm there! 
PHILLIP This is Steven. Steven- Blake and Baylor. 
BLAKE (Gasp) This is him?! This is your gay lawyer prison boyfriend?! Pleased to meet you. 
BAYLOR Much better than the guy who had you kidnapped. What was his name? 
Steven looks to Phillip, perplexed. 
PHILLIP Long story. 
STEVEN (regroups, to others) Can I get you all a drink? "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08    52. 
84   INT. PASSABLE APARTMENT KITCHEN, 1995 - LATER THAT NIGHT 84 
Steven works his way through the crowded apartment struggling to hold a few cocktail glasses for guests. 
He eventually arrives next to Phillip, who is having a great time with another friend- and older woman named EUDORA MIXON. 
STEVEN We gotta get a bigger place. 
PHILLIP Steven I want you to meet my old neighbor- Eudora Mixon. She is just the sweetest. 
EUDORA Pleasure Steven. 
STEVEN Eudora... 
PHILLIP Eudora owns a little building in Montrose and she's having a hell of time with the builder. He sounds like a real asshole. 
EUDORA His plans were useless and he's trying to sue me to pay him! I need your expertise Steven. Phillip says maybe you can help. 
STEVEN I could certainly try. 
EUDORA Can you still practice law, having been to prison? 
STEVEN Sure- why not? 
EUDORA I just thought- Oh what do I know? I'd just be glad to have someone I could trust. I'll pay your normal fee. 
Steven doesn't miss a beat. He smiles wide. 
STEVEN It would be my pleasure. Litigation is my speciality. 
Phillip beams with pride over Steven's decision. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages    5-23-08   53. 
85   INT. HOUSTON COURTHOUSE CORRIDOR, 1995 - DAY               85 
Eudora waits on a bench in the corridor, nervously glancing at her watch. Steven stands behind a column down the hall hiding and watching. He looks at his watch, then approaches her. 
STEVEN Sorry I'm late but I've been hung up in court all day. Let's go in. 
86   INT. HOUSTON COURTROOM, 1995 - DAY                         86 
STEVEN'S POV: A beautifully ornate courthouse LIGHT FIXTURE hangs from a courthouse ceiling. 
ON STEVEN, staring up at it with admiration. 
JUDGE (O.S.) Mister Russell? 
Steven snaps out of it and responds to a waiting JUDGE. 
STEVEN It's a beautiful fixture. 
JUDGE I know.   It's your turn. 
STEVEN Oh... (then) Your Honor, Ms. Mixon engaged Mr. Gage service in good faith and was given an inferior product. She is entitled to deem that work to be unacceptable according to the contract that Mr. Evans signed. 
LAWYER The terms of that contract were ambiguous at best. The truth is, defendant engaged my client for three years without full payment. 
STEVEN Your honor I have, in my briefcase, fourteen other contracts, all on public record, in which Mr. Evans entered into litigation with past clients of his! 
Eudora glances into Steven's opened BRIEFCASE. It contains only a SANDWICH and a PHOTO OF PHILLIP. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   54. 
The shocked LAWYER turns to his client (EVANS). 
LAWYER (whispers) Is this true? 
EVANS No. 
The group looks at him quizzically.     Just as it seems Steven has been up to nothing-- 
STEVEN (CONT'D) Well, I'll just show you. Todd? 
TODD, an incredibly hot assistant unveils an easel full of detailed tables. Steven walks the board through an incredibly well prepared presentation. 
STEVEN (CONT'D) If you look here at Mark's projections again for Q3, you'll see- well you'll see they're just that- projections. Projections based on a model set by my predecessor. I decided to reject that model and do things a little differently. I want to show you my results. This is what we actually made in Q3-- 
Todd flips to the next card. The graphs GROW exponentially. The group is intrigued. 
STEVEN (CONT'D) Now let me tell you how I did it... 
Todd unveils another card, the men are impressed by the unseen image. 
And as Steven explains himself, Dan and Birkheim smile broadly and turn to each other with smug assurance. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages      5-23-08    64. 
101   INT. NEW APARTMENT KITCHEN - 1996 - NIGHT                  101 
OPEN CLOSE on a candy wrapper opening. A hand removes the candy revealing an INSPIRING MESSAGE printed inside the wrapper- "When two hearts race, both win." 
ON PHILLIP. He's deeply touched by the sentiment as he chews on the candy. He puts the wrapper on the REFRIGERATOR with a MAGNET. 
He opens ANOTHER. He chews and reads- "Commit random acts of kindness" 
Again he's touched and puts it on the refrigerator. 
He opens ANOTHER and pops the candy in his mouth.    He reads- "A smile is a flower on your face" 
He's disgusted by the trite sentiment and THROWS THE WRAPPER IN THE TRASH. A beat later, he REMOVES THE CANDY from his mouth and THROWS THAT IN THE TRASH TOO. 
Just then Steven walks by in a TUXEDO, adjusting his tie. 
PHILLIP The tux? Where are you going? 
STEVEN It's just a work thing. Were we supposed to-- 
PHILLIP No- I just thought- it's fine. Where you going? 
STEVEN Some stupid gala ball thing... 
PHILLIP Gala? Oh... (playing it off) Sounds boring. 
STEVEN Yeah.   I'll be home early.   Promise. 
102   INT. HOUSTON BALLROOM - 1996 - NIGHT                       102 
A black-tie cocktail party is in full swing. Steven eats a canapé by a window. Something outside catches his eye. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   65. 
103   EXT. HOUSTON BALLROOM BALCONY, 1996 - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 103 
Dan Lindholm is out on the balcony staring up at the starry sky. Steven approaches. 
LINDHOLM You see that? 
Dan points out a small dot of light moving across the sky. Steven squints. 
STEVEN No... (realizing) Oh- is it...? 
LINDHOLM Yeah. Probably deploying the arm right now. Just a satellite deployment. Nothing special... Just touching the face of God. 
He chokes back a tear, then throws an arm around Steven. 
LINDHOLM (CONT'D) I want you to meet my wife. 
104   INT. HOUSTON BALLROOM, 1996 - NIGHT                        104 
Dan Lindholm escorts Steven to BEVERLY Lindholm and a ghastly gaggle of Texas society WIVES. 
LINDHOLM Bev- Ladies- I want you to meet Steven Russell, our CFO. 
MRS. LINDHOLM Oh I heard about you. 
STEVEN Good things I hope. 
MRS. LINDHOLM Yes and no. Don's bellyaching about how big your Christmas bonus is gonna be because you're making him so much money. 
A GIGGLE infects the group. Another WIFE speaks up. 
FACELIFT WIFE Are you married Steven? "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages    5-23-08   66. 
STEVEN Uh... engaged. 
BLONDE WIFE Well where is she, sweetheart? 
STEVEN She works. Travels a lot.     It's killing her she couldn't be here. 
And as the wives fret symathetically- 
105   INT. USAMM OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                            105 
LINDHOLM Hell of a hazard ain't it Steven? 
Eventually, a ball flies out of the trap. 
STEVEN (O.S.) (to ball) Oh yeah! How ya like that, sister!? 
CUT TO: 
112   EXT. HOUSTON GOLF COURSE FAIRWAY - 1996 - DAY              112 
Steven and the Client amble along a few yards behind Dan and the other client. Steven is covered in sweat and sand. 
CLIENT So the black fella says to the jew lawyer- "50 bucks a question? Ain't that expensive?" "Yeah it's expensive," he says, "I'm a Jew, you nigger!" 
The man laughs to himself. 
CLIENT (CONT'D) Get it?!! 
He soon spots his ball up ahead. 
CLIENT (CONT'D) There I am. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   70. 
He moves on, leaving Steven standing there, disgusted. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
113   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  113 
Steven sits at his desk, detached and fed up. 
STEVEN (V.O.) Maybe it was because it's just my nature, or maybe it was because of my past... or maybe it was because they were the most boring fucking people I'd ever met in my life... (beat) Whatever the reason, I had been robbing them blind for months. 
114   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  114 
FLASHBACK to Steven's first day on the job as his RHEBA escorts him to a desk piled high with financial reports. 
RHEBA Anything else I can do for you? 
STEVEN Uh.... cup of coffee? 
RHEBA I'll do it today but I don't do that really. 
Steven nods and begins to leaf through various folders. 
It isn't long before something catches his eye. 
115   MONTAGE: HOW MONEY FLOWS AT USAMM--                        115 
QUICK CUTS of Steven researching by leafing through folders and files INTERCUT with a slow push in on a CHECK PRINTING MACHINE as it spits out product as well as TIME LAPSE footage of employees buzzing through one of the USAM hallways. 
STEVEN (V.O.) The thing about U-SAMM was that they took in all this HMO money and distributed it to doctors. (MORE) "I Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages   5-23-08   71. 
STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) But in the time between receiving the money and paying it out- it was just sitting there, not making interest or anything. 
116   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                 116 
At his desk, Steven leafs through the company finances. 
STEVEN (V.O.) It occurred to me to set up an investment account where the held money would earn interest for the short time that the company had it. We're talking twenty two million at any given time here, so even short term the interest adds up pretty quickly. I'd be making the company millions virtually overnight. 
He leans back to think to himself. 
STEVEN (V.O.) ...and I of course would take a commission. Say... fifty percent. The only problem with that was-- I wasn't the one signing the checks. 
117   INT. USAMM OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                            117 
OPEN CLOSE on a check being signature-stamped with a RUBBER STAMP. A hand places the stamp into a small wooden box and closes it. 
CUT WIDE to reveal the hand belongs to VERA, the company accountant and STEVEN is standing over her. It is now we realize we are revisiting an earlier scene. 
STEVEN So I ask, "Don't you think that's a little expensive?" and the lawyer says, "Yes it is, now what's your final question?" 
Vera EXPLODES with laughter. 
VERA It's so true. Lawyers! 
She turns to a colleague. 
VERA (CONT'D) Annie! Come here, you gotta hear this! "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages    5-23-08    72. 
And as ANNIE comes over, Steven's hand moves to the wooden box and secretly plucks the RUBBER STAMP. 
118   INT. USAMM - STEVEN'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                  118 
Lindholm raps on the open door as he enters. 
LINDHOLM Steven, we got a problem. Vera lost that stupid rubber stamp again. Her office is a goddamned disaster and she's the o-ring if you know what I'm saying. 
STEVEN (faux) Oh... how long till we can get a new one? 
BIRKHEIM Which one is it? 
STEVEN SL.   That the C you're driving? 
BIRKHEIM Yeah. 
STEVEN Good car. 
BIRKHEIM Mmm hm. 
STEVEN Good value. 
DING! The door opens. Steven exits, leaving a disgruntled Birkheim in his wake. 
123   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                         123 
Birkheim pores over spreadsheets, taking notes and comparing numbers. CLOSE UPS on headings like "INTEREST EARNED" and "DEPOSIT" indicate he's looking for something 
He continues to make notes, growing ever more suspicious until something catches his eye. 
In the margin of one of the pages is a DOODLING of a SMILEY-FACED PENIS. 
Birkheim doesn't quite know what to make of this... but it seems to stare at him mockingly. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08    76. 
124   INT. USAMM HALLWAY - 1996 - DAY                            124 
Steven whistles happily and takes a draw off his coffee mug. As he passes an office, something catches his ear. 
BIRKHEIM (O.S.) I have some questions about these new accounts we've opened. 
Steven slows to a stop. 
125   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - CONTINUOUS                 125 
Birkheim, his back to the door, is on the phone as Steven eavesdrops outside. 
BIRKHEIM Yeah... I was wondering if we could compare some numbers. I know you usually talk to our CFO but this is a delicate matter and I'd like keep it secret for now. 
Steven is worried. 
126   INT. USAMM CUBICLE - 1996 - DAY                            126 
OPEN CLOSE on blank copies spitting out of a copier. Steven stands over the machine, his finger on the button as he keeps surveillance on Birkheim's office door. 
A SECRETARY arrives with a stack of papers. 
SECRETARY Hi Mister Ru-- 
STEVEN I'M MAKING COPIES!!! 
She leaves, terrified. 
Finally, Steven spots Birkheim leaving his office. 
127   INT. BIRKHEIM'S OFFICE - 1996 - DAY                        127 
Steven runs into Birkheim's office and scans the papers on his desk. Nothing. 
He turns his attention to Birkheim's briefcase, but he can't get it open. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages    5-23-08     77. 
Eventually he spots a blank legal pad and looks at it closely. He grabs a pencil and does the old detective trick of shading in the page to reveal what was written on the now missing page above. 
The embossed text reads, "837,502.12" 
He stares at it a moment. This number looks familiar. He grabs the phone and dials. An AUTOMATED VOICE answers. 
AUTOMATED TELLER Hello, you've reached the Automatic Teller at Texas Commerce Bank. Please enter your personal account number followed by the pound sign. 
Steven quickly enters some numbers. As he listens he flips through Birkheim's desktop calendar. 
AUTOMATED TELLER (CONT'D) Thank you. Your account balance is eight hundred-thirty seven thousand five hundred and two dollars and twelve cents. To repeat this- 
It's the SAME NUMBER as on the pad. He hangs up. And turns his attention to the calendar. He spies an entry that reads, "Harris County Police, 12:30" 
He leaps out of the chair and exits the office. 
128   INT. USAMM COPIER ROOM - 1996 - DAY                        128 
Steven furiously shreds documents in the company's PAPER SHREDDER. Moments later the same SECRETARY enters the room with an armload of work- enraging Steven. 
STEVEN CAN'T YOU SEE I'M SHREDDING!? 
Terrified, the woman runs away. 
129   EXT. BANK - DAY                                            129

130   INT. DEBBIE'S HOME - NIGHT                                 130 
STEVEN We'll get a place. Do some fishing. I can work on my key lime pie recipe... 
Steven picks up the suitcase without zipping it up and heads back into the hall. 
STEVEN (CONT'D) ...I might even grow a beard and enter the Papa Hemingway contest! 
He stops short in the hallway.   Phillip is gone. "I Love You Phillip Morris"     Green Pages   5-23-08   81. 
STEVEN (CONT'D) Phillip? Honey? 
135   EXT. NEW HOUSE - 1996 - DAY                              135 
Steven bursts from the house still clutching the suitcase just in time to see Phillip's car rounding the corner. 
STEVEN COME BACK! WAIT! 
136   INT. NEW HOUSE - 1996 - DAY                              136 
He re-enters, emptying the suitcase along the way. He then proceeds to fill it with the cash on the table. 
137   EXT. NEW HOUSE - 1996 - DAY                              137 
Steven exits and heads for his car, but before he can get in- 
WHAM! He's grabbed by a group of POLICEMEN. He SQUEALS like a rabbit's death bleat and flails wildly. 
This continues for a while until-- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
138   INT. TEXAS STATE PEN HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY          138 
Steven resumes his VOICE OVER in the penitentiary infirmary. 
STEVEN (V.O.) There I was, keeping secrets, living a lie. Like I said, I tend to do that. Now I didn't blame Phillip for running out on me, but I had to make things right. I had to get him back. You see, there's something I didn't tell you... (beat) ...it's about my old boyfriend. Do you remember him? His name was Jimmy.

The Florida sun bathes the bedroom in a heavenly glow, illuminating Jimmy Kemple as he wakes. He opens his eyes to see Steven staring longingly at him. 
KEMPLE What? 
Steven just smiles. 
KEMPLE (CONT'D) What? 
STEVEN I love you Jimmy. 
Kemple smirks. 
KEMPLE It's only been a month, Steven. 
STEVEN I know. 
KEMPLE Don't fall for me Steven. 
STEVEN Why the hell not? 
KEMPLE You know damn well why. 
Steven thinks a moment, but never stops smiling. 
STEVEN I don't give a shit about that. 
They kiss.

She exits. Steven tries to give Kemple some water. Kemple resists. 
STEVEN Come on. You need to drink something. 
Kemple meekly hands Steven his stainless steel ROLEX. 
KEMPLE I want you to have this because I'm gonna be leaving soon... 
STEVEN Well that's not okay with me baby. You can't leave. I need you around here. You're the love of my life. 
KEMPLE You're sweet... but no, I'm not. 
STEVEN Shhhh... 
KEMPLE I'm not. I've seen him. You haven't met him yet, but you will... 
Steven is perplexed. 
KEMPLE (CONT'D) You're gonna be so happy. And I know you don't think so, but you deserve to be happy... 
STEVEN You're not thinking clearly baby. "I Love You Phillip Morris"       Green Pages     5-23-08   87.

OPEN CLOSE ON the stainless steel ROLEX. WE'RE BACK outside Steven and Phillip's house in a POLICE CRUISER. Steven stares at it, reflecting on his memory of Kemple. 
STEVEN (V.O.) I'm sorry I didn't tell you before. I just don't like talking about some things. 
The door opens and a HOUSTON COP hands him a black LEATHERETTE CASE. 
HOUSTON COP This what you wanted? 
STEVEN Oh thanks. 
HOUSTON COP Diabetes huh? 
STEVEN Yeah... 
The cop gets in and they drive off. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   89. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
187    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN, 1998 - INFIRMARY ENTRANCE - DAY     187 
Phillip flails as GUARDS hold him back from a DOCTOR. 
PHILLIP LET ME IN!   Just let me in! "I Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages      5-23-08    103. 
DOCTOR He's not here! 
PHILLIP I need to see him! 
DOCTOR I told you he's not here! You need to calm down. 
Phillip calms himself. 
PHILLIP Just tell me where he is. What happened? 
DOCTOR He slipped into a coma for a few days. He's conscious now, but he's very sick. We had him transferred to a private care facility. There was nothing we could do for him here. It's just a matter of time now. 
Phillip listens in devastated silence. 
188    EXT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER - 1998 - DAY                 188 
Steven looks worse than ever in his semi-private bed, looking out the window at the clouds with a catatonic gaze. 
He's at peace. It is the moment of his death. 
CARETAKER (O.S.) Steven? 
Death will have to wait another few moments.    A nurse leans over him as he tries to focus. 
CARETAKER (CONT'D) Steven? Someone wants to talk to you. He keeps calling. He's driving us crazy. 
Steven can't respond.    The nurse picks up the phone. 
CARETAKER (CONT'D) (into phone) Okay you can put him through. 
She puts the phone to Steven's ear. He can muster only a few words. "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages       5-23-08   104. 
STEVEN (wisp) I didn't want you to find out... 
189    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN INFIRMARY OFFICE - 1998- DAY          189 
Phillip is INTERCUT with the helpless Steven. 
PHILLIP Steven. Oh God... Why didn't you write me? I don't know how this happened, they say I'm fine. Oh God, who did this? (then) It doesn't matter. I had to talk to you Steven. (tearing up) I am still angry with you, but I need you to know something. Even if sometimes I don't know who you are, I love you. I never stopped loving you. (smiles) You and me are just fools for love I guess- written in the stars or some crap like that. (tears) But it was never better, never more real than with you Steven. I realize now that all that crazy shit you did- in your fucked up way- it was always for me. Always for us. You are the most amazing man Steven. It takes my breath away. And even though I can't be with you now, I will always be yours... Forever. 
He steels himself as best he can. 
PHILLIP (CONT'D) Now if you have to go, go. It's okay. I'm right there. Okay? I'm right there. 
Tears surface again.   He chokes back a sob. 
190    INT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER - 1998 - CONTINUOUS         190 
As a single tear runs down Steven's face, the nurse puts the phone on the hook and leaves. 
Steven lies motionless.   He gazes out the window to the passing clouds in the sky. It's time.

191    INT. TX STATE PEN, 1998 - CELLBLOCK - DAY                  191 
Samuel walks past cell after cell with a grave look in his eyes. Eventually he arrives at Phillip's cell to find him sitting on his bunk. 
SAMUEL Phillip...? 
Phillip looks up. 
SAMUEL (CONT'D) Uh- my friend in the infirmary... Uh, they got a call from that long term care place and uh, well a few days ago Steven- (then) ...I'm so sorry Phillip. 
Phillip nods as it washes over him. He sends Samuel on his way with a look. Once he's alone, Phillip lets go and SOBS. 
He buries his face in his pillow. After a long while- 
CLANG. A sound gets his attention.    A BOSSY GUARD stands at the door of his cell. 
BOSSY GUARD Morris.   Come with me. 
Phillip composes himself and follows the guard out. 
192    INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY CORRIDOR - 1998 - DAY        192 
The guard leads Phillip down the corridor. Still coming out of his mournful haze, he becomes curious. They arrive at a door marked, "MEETING ROOM 2". 
PHILLIP Where are we going? 
BOSSY GUARD Your lawyer's here. 
FLASHBACK. Steven sits before a YOUNG PRISON DOCTOR who looks through his records. 
YOUNG DOCTOR ...you have AIDS. 
Steven sits expressionless. 
STEVEN How long do I have? 
And off the Doctor's grave face-- "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages     5-23-08    109. 
201    INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 201 
Steven lays in his hospital bed. A FAT NURSE puts a pill in his mouth and follows it with some water. She exits. 
Once she's clear, Steven reaches into his mouth and pulls out the pill. He secretly places it into a small HOLE in his mattress for safe keeping. 
202    INT. TEXAS STATE PENITENTIARY HOSPITAL WARD - 1998 - DAY 202 
FLASHBACK. Again, we are at the first hospital scene of the movie. The cardio ALARM blares. Steven watches as a DOCTOR appears and pushes the nurses aside. 
DOCTOR Where's the crash cart!? 
He straddles the patient's chest and pushes down hard- the sound of a sternum CRACKING can be heard. 
With the staff distracted, Steven reaches into his mattress hole and pulls out scores of pills. He stuffs them into his mouth as fast as he can. 
STEVEN (V.O.) But the hardest part by far is getting transferred to a private care facility. It's standard procedure for late stage patients, but convincing them I was about to die would involve taking a few risks. 
He chases the pills down with a glass of water. 
203    EXT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY                 203 
Steven is helped from a corrections van into a wheelchair outside the Restful Acres facility. 
STEVEN (V.O.) After a four day coma, they were convinced. 
204    INT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY                 204 
In his bed at the care facility, Steven looks around and picks up the phone. He talks with a FOREIGN ACCENT. 
STEVEN This is Doctor Rios from the Hamblin Center, Houston. I'm looking for AIDS patients for a study we're... "I Love You Phillip Morris"   Green Pages      5-23-08   110. 
And as he talks-- 
STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) And once I got settled in, I just called the Department of Corrections and convinced them I was a state-sponsored doctor looking for late stage AIDS patients for an experimental treatment. (then) As luck would have it, they had one patient that was eligible... 
Steven continues his Dr. Rios imitation on the phone. 
STEVEN Oh you do? Steven Russell? Could you spell that? 
CAMERA SETTLES on a nearby CALENDAR.    It reads: "MONDAY, JANUARY 5" 
MATCH DISSOLVE TO: 
205    INT. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY                   205 
The calendar reads "FRIDAY, MARCH 13"    An ORDERLY enters with a WHEELCHAIR. 
ORDERLY Mister Russell, the clinic sent a taxi here to pick you up. 
206    I/E. RESTFUL ACRES CARE CENTER, 1998 - DAY                   206 
Later that day, Steven is helped out of his wheelchair into a waiting taxi. 
STEVEN (V.O.) And for all that time- all those doctors, all those nurses and all those facilities... not one of them ever thought to give me an AIDS test... 
The door SLAMS and off he drives. 
STEVEN (V.O.) Fucking Texas... 
207    INT. TAXI, 1998 - DAY                                        207 
Once clear, Steven speaks to the driver. "I Love You Phillip Morris"    Green Pages      5-23-08   111. 
STEVEN I had a special request when I ordered the cab. Did they tell you? 
TAXI DRIVER Yeah- right here. 
He lifts a GREASY BROWN BAG into view. 
STEVEN Thank God. 
Steven grabs it and begins to gorge himself on BURGERS. 
STEVEN (V.O.) (CONT'D) A week later, the hospice was to get a call from Doctor Rios, telling them Steven Russell had died undergoing treatment. And after all that hard work dying? Where's the first place I go? 
208    INT. TEXAS STATE PEN MEETING ROOM, 1998 - DAY              208

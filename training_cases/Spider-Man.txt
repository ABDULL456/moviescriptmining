SECOND REV. 
FADE IN: INT. PROFESSOR OCK"S PRIVATE PHYSICS LABORATORY, THE CYCLOTRON ROOM (CREDIT SEQUENCE) - DAY 
A mighty WARNING KLAXON assaults our ears. A FLASHING RED WARNING LIGHT stabs our eyes. 
Several DIALS go into the RED. A hand pushes aside a YELLOW THERMOS and pushes forward a RED POWER THROTTLE. We hear the WHINING UP of a cyclotron. A DIGITAL DIAL climbs to "5% POWER." A SPIDER crawls across a DIAL. 
Begin OPENING CREDITS. 
THE CYCLOTRON ROOM is in an old basement full of peeling paint and plumbing wrapped with TAPE. Leaks are here and there. COBWEBS are all around. 
DOCTOR OTTO OCTAVIUS (OCK) is a strong but strange featured man in his mid-fifties. 
His assistant, WEINER, hovers nearby looking on. He's open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. WEINER is a local, small-time hood hired by OCK to circumvent the school administration and to "procure" whatever OCK needs for his experiments. He shades his eyes against a searing BLUE-WHITE BEAM that erupts from the WINDOW. THE ROOM IS DIVIDED INTO A CONTROL ROOM AND THE EXPERIMENT CHAMBERS. 
WEINER Whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that? 
With a WHOOSH, the WINDOW EXPLODES, showering the TWO with shards of GLASS, and throwing them to the floor. 
OCK (rising) We begin again... let's kick in that new transducer. See if we can double the power output. 
WEINER (rising more slowly) Whoa, Doc... wait a minute... 
But OCK is already at the THROTTLE. The cyclotron whirls up. The lights go on. Louder, brighter than before. OCK looks through the broken WINDOW into the EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER. The POWER DIAL inches upward, "eight, nine..." the BLUE-WHITE LIGHT is blinding now. The WHINE pitch is shattering. 
END OPENING CREDITS. 
OCK Okey... dokey! 
The POWER DIAL hits ten. 
EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY - DAY 
As STUDENTS go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills out of the SCIENCE CENTER onto the grounds of Empire State University. 
We see PETER PARKER, a pleasant faced senior who's among the top in his class. Sincere and serious, he has yet to develop a way with women. 
LIZ (falling in step) Hiya Peter... 
LIZ ALLEN is also a senior. She's beautiful and intelligent. 
PETER (ardent but uncomfortable) Hiya Liz... how're you doing...? 
LIZ (teasing softly) How'm I doing what? 
HARRY Peter! Peter! Wait up! 
HARRY is the school nerd. A quirky kid who, like PETER, can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty ones like Liz. 
HARRY (to Liz) Would you, uh... excuse us for a minute? 
Despite PETER'S protesting body language, HARRY pulls him away like a conspirator. 
PETER What is it? what... 
HARRY Did the Astro-Physics Journal really accept your paper? 
PETER (laughs, embarrassed) Yeah... well... all I got's the data but they've agreed to publish it when it's finished. You know... it's my calculation on the Planetary Conjunction. 
HARRY And its influence on the anti-force. Isn't it? 
PETER Yes. Look, Harry, I am busy with... (indicates Liz standing there) 
HARRY Yeah, you and the rest of the class. Every one is busy with Liz. 
LIZ (growing impatient) Peter? 
A HAND reaches in and smacks her bottom. 
FLASH Hiya, cupcakes... 
LIZ (elbowing him affectionately) Flash...! 
They kiss and walk away. 
HARRY (sneering) And Flash is the busiest of them all... 
PETER (disappointed) Come on, Harry... we'll be late for Octavius. 
HARRY makes a gesture dismissing OCK as crazy. 
LIZ Ahh, it is something. 
PETER No... look. 
The equipment on her TABLE is starting to vibrate. They look at it, curiously. We hear the cyclotron's WHINE begin to build... 
INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - DAY 
Everything is shaking like in an earthquake... Roz and Thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with anger and surprise. The WHINE is deafening! The light is blinding! WEINER has his eyes closed and his hands over his ears. 
OCK I am going for 20 percent power! 
THORKEL NO!! Don't do that... 
ROZ Ock! Its dangerous... 
THORKEL Ock I warn you... 
WEINER crosses himself. The CONSOLE erupts in sparks. 
INT. ELECTRICAL CONDUIT MONTAGE - DAY 
We follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along the WIRES and CABLES inside the WALLS and FLOORS. It is making its way up to the LAB! 
INT. LAB - DAY 
All the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating equipment. 
The CHARGE crackles up a WIRE and erupts at LIZ'S TABLE. A BREAKER explodes in flames. There is an outburst of AD LIBS: "Fire!" "Everybody out!" 
THORKEL (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing LIZ trapped behind the fire which is growing from second to second. 
THORKEL Keep calm, everybody keep calm. Use the front door. Everybody out the front. 
PETER Liz! Come on...! 
LIZ I can't. Help me! 
PETER I'm coming! 
He wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the FLAMES. His sleeve is on fire. He pats it out. 
LIZ Peter! 
Flash appears and tries to help but Thorkel stops him. 
THORKEL Get back, you idiots. You can't go in there! 
LIZ smashes at the WINDOW, but this is an inner city school and the WINDOWS are covered by STEEL GATES. Liz wraps her fingers in the GATE. 
LIZ (out at the street) Help! Help me! 
Outside the WINDOW the air is clear and people come and go. Some are stopping to look up at the girl on the second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course) down at them as the FLAMES close in behind her. 
PETER comes flying in with a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. He fumbles with it. FLASH pushes Thorkel, grabs the extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain. LIZ turns to face the FLAMES. Suddenly there is an eruption of CO2 CLOUDS and the roar of a FIRE EXTINGUISHER. 
The FLAMES are beaten down enough for her to leap out. FLASH is there, holding the EXTINGUISHER. People CHEER. 
PETER Thanks for your help Flash. 
FLASH No problem wimp. 
PETER Our hero has a real way with words. 
LIZ Oh, why don't you grow up. 
PETER is stung, insulted, turns away. ROSOMORF peeps in, worried -- faces Thorkel. 
THORKEL This man will bring a disaster upon this university. 
OCK comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has happened. 
OCK The universe is made up of forces... and counter-forces. Science is the study of the forces! 
FLASH hands the EXTINGUISHER to PETER. LIZ embraces FLASH, throwing a glimpse at PETER who tried so bravely. He looks away and turns the last of the EXTINGUISHER on the last of the FIRE. 
OCK (continues without a hitch) But I... Professor Otto Octavius... have devoted my life to the study of the counter-forces! Good job, Peter. 
PETER (taking place at lab table) Thanks, Professor. 
THORKEL has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the front of the huge LAB. He simply cannot believe OCK'S behavior. 
THORKEL I don't believe it, I simply don't... 
OCK Can we carry on Mr. Thorkel. 
THORKEL I don't believe... oh, all right carry on Professor. 
OCK Well! This week my dear students I have made a stunning breakthrough... 
PETER You don't get nicknamed Flash because you're a rocket scientist, Liz. 
LIZ Give it up, Parker. You'd die for a nickname like Flash. 
PETER Yeah, of embarrassment. 
KIM comes by and leans seductively by her LOCKER. KIM is a ripe one and hot-hot-hot! 
KIM (teasing) Hey, Flash... I'm scalping a pair of the Midnight Madness Wrestling Match tomorrow night. 
FLASH The Slammies??? I'd kill for that!!! 
KIM Would you pay $125? 
FLASH Well, uh, I... gee... if... can I tell you tomorrow? 
KIM (moving on) You snooze, you lose. Hiya Liz... 
LIZ Kim, you know Peter and Harry? This is my new roommate... Kim Nickson. 
KIM is pulling her pet, a foot long SALAMANDER, out of her LOCKER. She wraps it around her neck and turns to the boys. 
They go bug-eyed! 
KIM (interested) Hellooo, Peter. 
PETER (embarrassed) Hi... 
LIZ We're going to the Student Reunion Meeting. You coming? 
Peter looks at KIM. Wow. Then he looks at LIZ who's adjusting herself in a small MIRROR. HARRY jabs him in the ribs. Yeah, yeah! 
PETER (frustrated) I can't... I gotta go over to the Daily Bugle. I'm trying to sell some photos. 
KIM Soooh, a photographer...? 
PETER Just an amateur. Well... nice meeting you, Kim. 
KIM Yeah... I bet it would be. 
HARRY Can I be your date for the reunion ShooShoo? 
KIM No Jerk! 
HARRY (she turns to go) What did I say... 
LIZ It's not what you said, it's how you say it, ShooShoo! 
Everybody leaves and Harry is left alone, he throws his bag down. 
HARRY Damn! 
PETER turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking WEINER. 
WEINER Peter, Doc Ock wants to see you. 
PETER About my data I bet. 
WEINER I don't know. 
PETER He knows about my work on the Planetary Conjunction, doesn't he? 
WEINER (lies) I don't know. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
PETER enters wide-eyed behind WEINER. This place is a far cry from the experiment in the LAB ROOM. It's a fantastic netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. No one but PETER. 
OCK is sitting in a swivel CHAIR with his back to PETER. He has the look of Captain Nemo in his Nautilus. This is OCK'S domain. 
PETER Hello, Professor Octavius. (no response) I really admired your experiment. 
OCK (back to Peter) We have a lot of interests in common, Peter. Perhaps we should put our heads together, if you know what I mean... 
PETER (flattered) That would be... great. 
OCK (turns with a smile) Now you take the Planetary Conjunction. This Saturday night we will witness Saturn, Jupiter, the Moon, the Earth, the Sun... all in a row. Never seen within the memory of man, or measured for its effect. The total gravitational force must be quite exceptional. Isn't that the subject of your paper...? 
PETER Yes sir, I've worked out a new way to calculate the combined gravitational effect. 
OCK I'm a busy man, Mr. Parker. But I think I could find the time to go over it with you. Make sure it all... checks out. 
PETER Well... I'm sort of working with Professor Rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us. He thinks that my theory is... well, I don't know... 
OCK (to himself) The scoundrel... (turns angry) I want to see that data, Peter! 
PETER But Professor Octavius... if I knew you were interested... sorry, I've already given it to... Professor Rosomorf, and he is after all the head of our Physics Department... and I couldn't... 
OCK turns sweet again. He smiles too broadly. 
She grabs her coat, crosses back to Peter and tugs on his shoulder. 
PETER It's Friday night... 
MAY Yes. Do you have a date? 
PETER No. 
MAY Then come on. 
INT. LARGE COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT 
It is dark and empty except for COMPUTERS. Sitting at it, lit by the GLOW of its screen, is SOLOMON ROSOMORF (ROZ). As he works, a DOOR opens behind him. Someone walks quietly through the LAB. ROSOMORF keeps working. The intruder approaches... 
THORKEL (at his ear) Professor Rosomorf, what happened here? 
ROZ Someone tried to rob me of some paper... I suspect they were looking for that one. 
THORKEL What is it? 
ROZ (unruffled) Award winning stuff. (turning slightly) Peter Parker's data on the Planetary Conjunction. Damn lucky I hid it in my computer under another title. 
THORKEL My God, what's going on in our school? First Professor Octavius almost blows up the Physics lab... Now this. You report it in triplicate, of course. 
ROZ Thorkel, be careful when you talk to Octavius. Remember... the man is a very fragile genius. One day he'll bring us all the Noble Prize. 
THORKEL Rosomorf, the man is a very dangerous crackpot! 
Off screen the voice of the CYCLOTRON WHINE begins to build. 
ROZ That's him again. He's working day and night. 
THORKEL I tell you the man is very dangerous. (the whine grows louder) Come on Rosomorf, let's stop him before this building will explode. 
INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT 
OCK and WEINER are at work as before. OCK takes no notice of the TWO MEN who come in, nor the WORKER who comes in behind them and sets to work attaching a BIG LOCK to the door. 
THORKEL Shut it down, Octavius. 
OCK ignores him. WEINER touches OCK'S shoulder. OCK ignores him too. 
THORKEL You've blown half the circuits in the Science Center. 
OCK Call an electrician. 
THORKEL I have called the locksmith. 
OCK What... what is he doing. 
He points toward the worker who's working on the lock on the main door. 
THORKEL We have to shut your lab down and take a look at the lines. 
ROZ Please, Otto, we must lock it up. 
OCK (to Thorkel) You're denying me access to my cyclotron?! 
THORKEL You bet. 
OCK glares back and forth between the TWO MEN, the WORKER, and WEINER. Then he pulls BACK the RED POWER THROTTLE. 
The WHINE descends. 
The WALDOS pull back and dangle from their panel. The WHINE dies. 
OCK (contemplating) Okey, dokey... just give me till tomorrow. I want to clean up my papers. Tomorrow... Ha... Tomorrow you can have this room... 
ROZ Oh... well Thorkel... few more hours won't make a difference. 
THORKEL I hope. 
He signals to the worker to stop. 
INT. APARTMENT OF AUNT MAY AND UNCLE BEN - NIGHT 
The N.Y. Mets are playing baseball on T.V. PETER watches with his UNCLE BEN, a paunchy 65 years old in POLYESTER SLACKS and a COMFY OLD SWEATER. A N.Y. METS CAP is perched on BEN'S head. A BEER CAN is in his hand. A cluttered but familiar living room sprawls comfortably around them. 
BEN Another brewski? 
PETER No, I'm fine, Uncle Ben. 
BEN (at T.V.) Yah! Way to do it. Alright! (to Peter) You don't follow the Mets like you used to, do you, Pete? 
PETER No, not so much anymore. 
BEN Funny. When your Mom and Dad, uh, passed away... I had this idea... I wanted you to be the best baseball player that ever was. Geez, what ever happened to that? 
PETER Little league. 
PETER Sorry... I'd better go now. 
OCK (really angry now) You'll be sorry, Parker. 
PETER leaves. 
Another URGENT WARNING TONE causes OCK to look at the monitor SCREEN. On it, flashing RED, is the word, "OVERLOAD!" OCK pushes the RED POWER THROTTLE forward! The WHINE increases to a PULSE and THROB. 
INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT 
Incredibly lit, the SPIDER is dropping on it's shimmering WEB-STRAND down toward the 5KG WEIGHT which now GLOWS in time with the THROB and PULSE. 
INT. THE CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
The MONITOR is flashing "MAXIMUM OVERLOAD - SHUT DOWN!" OCK continues with the experiment. And then he sees the SPIDER! 
OCK You! Get out of there, you creeping... 
He tries to shove the SPIDER with his hand. 
INT. EXPERIMENTAL CHAMBER - NIGHT 
Through the BLUE-WHITE we can barely make out OCK on the other side if the shattered WINDOW. He sends TWO WALDOS after the SPIDER. The SPIDER evades him and jumps onto the PROFESSOR's back. It then climbs onto the PROFESSOR's neck and bites him. 
OCK (anguish) Noooooooooooo! 
The gravity DIAL goes to .000001, then pops back up as OCK'S tiny world goes berserk. DIALS spin, crack, explode or droop liquidly. WIRES dance on the CONSOLE which erupts like the 4th of JULY. 
OCK begins to float. His shirt begins to tear away. A DIAL floats by with its pulled WIRES undulating like a Medusa. WALDOS smash through the walls and flail like snakes. OCK'S YELLOW THERMOS distorts and EXPLODES! OCK, his hair wild, face locked in a multi-G grimace, is pinned halfway up a wall that is showering the room with SPARKS. 
OCK (ecstasy above the din) It's an energy storm! Okey! Dokey! 
We see clearly the SPIDER still stuck to his neck. The big beast buffets and shakes. Tubes, junctions, valves and whatnot fall off, crashing to the floor where they twitch and writhe with a life of their own. 
Then, an enormous EXPLOSION rips a large hole in the CYCLOTRON's side, sending debris and a HUNDRED MICRO- STREAMS of ELECTRONIC PARTICLES lancing in our direction. 
INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Ultimate weirdness! The PULSING BLUE-WHITE LIGHT penetrates first the DOOR of the CYCLOTRON ROOM and then the very walls! LOCKERS bang, LAMPS POP, the ceiling sags in a SURREAL, RUBBERY way. 
The WALLS sag too! The CYCLOTRON SIGN pivots and embeds itself in a WALL. A LADDER sinks in the WALL. The BLUE- WHITE LIGHT dances wildly about in PULSES. Then, suddenly, it stops... DEAD SILENCE. WEINER comes running in holding a double decker sandwich and a large bottle of Pepsi. Weiner enters OCK'S lab, singing, not at first noticing what's going on. Suddenly he stops dead. 
INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT 
A scene out of DALI's surrealistic canvas. There are things inside of other things. DIALS look like DALI watches. This place has been rippled to the max! OCK lays face up, unconscious on the floor, a WALDO across his chest. The SPIDER is weaving its web. CAMERA slowly DOWN to see OCK. PIPES and WIRES are stuck to his body. The WALDO seems to be wrapping him. He wakes up to see those MECHANICAL ARMS buried in his body. They weave around him as if they are looking for prey. He tries to tear them out, but they seem to be a part of his body, like his other limbs. He screams. Suddenly Weiner sees OCK. 
WEINER Professor... what happened to you? What did you do... 
Suddenly one of the waldos hits him so strongly that he flies back and out through the door to the corridor. 
INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT 
WEINER Oh my God... what happened here... 
He hears the police sirens approaching, he runs away. 
WEINER I better get out of here. 
EXT. THE EMPIRE UNIVERSITY - NIGHT 
The long SCREAM segues to a POLICE SIREN. A COP CAR pulls to a halt in front of the COLLEGE. Many NYPD CARS are already there, along with a NUCLEAR REGULATORY VAN, some AMBULANCES, a VAN from the ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY and TWO TV VANS. ROZ runs across the lawn. 
POLICE STRUGGLE to hold back the crowd of press, students and general gawkers. 
J. JAMESON pushes to the front of the mob in time to see TWO COPS hustle a BUGLE PHOTOGRAPHER back into it. The MAN shakes his head. JAMESON throws down his CIGAR, stomps it, and pulls out a fresh one. THORKEL arrives to address the CROWD. 
THORKEL (through bull horn) There is no danger. Please go back to your dorms. I repeat, there is no danger. 
JAMESON (approaches him) Spill it out, Professor! The public wants to know! 
The CROWD closes on THORKEL. 
THORKEL Who are you? 
JAMESON Jameson, Daily Bugle, Chief Editor, now what really happened here? 
THORKEL There will be a press announcement in the morning Mr. Jameson... now if you'll excuse me. 
This elicits a flood of AD LIBS: "I heard a terrible explosion?" "Nuclear accidents?" "Meltdown?" "Genetic engineering?" "Are you guys making mutants in there?" 
THORKEL I have nothing to say... there will be an announcement. Now, please go home... everybody... we must clear the grounds... 
In the back of the crowd are PETER, HARRY, LIZ, FLASH and KIM. 
FLASH You think they'll cancel classes? 
HARRY They must... the whole building must be contaminated with some kind of poisonous gas. 
PETER How about nuclear contaminations? 
As PETER looks out at the STRETCHER, the SPIDER drops on his neck. He reacts by swatting it away. Bad move. The GLOWING SPIDER now squats malevolently on the back of PETER's hand. He stares at it transfixed. It bites. 
PETER Ow!!! 
PETER throws the SPIDER to the ripply tile floor where it scuttles unsteadily out the door. 
Sweat starts to bead on PETER'S face. He shakes his head to clear it. His vision becomes uncertain. He lurches against a WEIRD SINK. 
PETER'S POV is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not just moving in and out anamorphically. It's all of that! 
GUARD (V.O.) (heavily distorted) Hey! What are you doing here, kid? 
PETER turns to see a UNIFORMED GUARD distorted by his crazy vision. 
PETER I feel a little funny... 
GUARD (heavily distorted) Yeah? Well, I ain't laughing. Get out... Just get out of here... 
EXT. FIRE DOOR - NIGHT 
It bangs open. The GUARD throws PETER out and then throws his BACK PACK at him. 
GUARD (still distorted) You get yourself over to the Police lines. 
PETER (ultra wooz) Right. Police lines. 
EXT. UNIVERSITY - NIGHT 
PETER melds into the crowd. As in a dream, JAMESON appears at his side. 
JAMESON (distorted) Okay, scoop, whaddaya got? 
PETER I... got pictures of the Professor... in there... it's so strange in there... so bizarre... 
JAMESON (winks) Good job, kid. Bizarre is what we need. Pick this up in the morning. (holding up his camera) There'll be two crisp twenties tucked inside. 
He hurries off. PETER peers after him and all of a sudden his vision corrects to a perfect focus. The sweat is gone. He's okay. He makes his way through the crowd to the street. 
We TRACK with PETER as the madding throng recedes behind him. He turns a corner. He hears a SIREN. 
An AMBULANCE screeches around the corner. It nearly hits PETER who leaps to avoid it. 
EXT. BRICK BUILDING - NIGHT 
PETER'S cheek is pressed against the brick. He opens his eyes and sees that he's hanging onto the side of the building like a spider. And he's three stories up! He looks down and sees the street thirty feet below him! And the Ambulance which he jumped over is driving away. He tries a downward step, but a BRICK dislodges and crashes to the sidewalk. He takes an upward step. And then another. 
Tentatively at first, and then with growing confidence, he "crawls" to the roof of the building. At the top he gropes for a RAILING and slips. He dangles eight stories above the street. Then, with a grunt, he vaults to the roof one-handed. 
EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT 
PETER is flat on his back, staring at the stars. He sits up and looks wonderingly at his hands. 
On the back of his right hand are TWO PUNCTURE WOUNDS surrounded by a faint BLUE-WHITE PULSING GLOW. The GLOW disappears. 
PETER (mutters to himself) This is weird. My God, I feel so weird... 
He leaps to his feet. He flexes. Feels weird. Good Weird. In fact, great weird! He tries a couple of "jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the air! 
PETER (exhilarated) Very weird. 
The great, bespangled, NEW YORK CITY is his backdrop as PETER jumps and turns and does loops in the air. With the agility and tactility of a spider, PETER leaps from the RAILING to a WALL to a FLAG POLE to another WALL where he lands sideways and sticks. 
PETER (sideways) Very, very weird. 
He leaps off the WALL and lands at the edge of the roof. He looks down. No one's looking back. So, he takes a step back and leaps the alley to the next roof. 
EXT. ROOFTOP SHACK - NIGHT 
PETER lands on it. The next roof is seven stories up and across the street. PETER bites his lip. 
PETER Well, what the hell!! 
EXT. THE TALLER BUILDING - NIGHT 
Backlit by a FULL MOON, PETER somersaults to the roof of the taller building, and misses the top! 
He sticks to the brick FACADE, upside down! He laughs with the moment. A WINDOW opens below him and a pretty BLONDE in a TOWEL sticks her head out. She looks this way and that, and all she sees is a MAN in a LOUD SPORTCOAT down the street. Never thinking to look up, she withdraws into the room. 
EXT. CHELSEA STREET - NIGHT 
The MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT leans against a LAMP POST and lights a CIGARETTE with a BEAT UP, SILVER PLATED LIGHTER. 
In the LIGHTER he sees a reflection of PETER leaping off the taller building. He snaps around and looks up in time to see PETER make it to the next FACADE. 
EXT. ROOFTOP MONTAGE - NIGHT 
With the UPTOWN SKYLINE behind him, PETER casts caution to the wind and leaps from rooftop to rooftop. 
Watching from the street, the MAN in the LOUD SPORTCOAT follows PETER'S progress. 
AUNT MAY Oh, you did it in the bathroom? Peter, this is craziness, why don't you use your bed? You're up all night. You're in the radioactive labs. You never take time to eat or sleep. Am I right? 
PETER Yes, Aunt May. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT 
AUNT MAY (V.O.) Did you eat something today? 
PETER Yes, Aunt May. 
AUNT MAY (V.O.) Okay, Peter go back to bed, and remember we love you. 
PETER And I love you too, Aunt May. (hangs up) And by the way, I got a mess of super powers today. 
Exit booth. He BANGS the PHONE BOOTH. Goes out and-- jumps lightly onto the phone booth roof. 
INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT 
OCK is prepped for surgery. GOWNED PERSONNEL hurry about with a feverish urgency. The CHIEF SURGEON checks the SENSORS attached to OCK'S head. These seasoned professionals are astonished and frightened. 
CHIEF SURGEON (whispers) Look at these brainwave readings. The mental activity is ten times of any normal man...! 
BRAINMAN (whispers) Equipment malfunction...? 
CHIEF SURGEON (whispers) Hell, yeah... his. (checks Ock's chest) My God... I thought I'd seen everything... 
SURGEON #2 (whispers) But this is beyond medicine. This is madness...! 
OCK lays bare chested, face up, all FOUR WALDOS splayed. He is a true cyborg. Part man, part machine. Part organic, part molybdenum steel. 
NURSE (leaning in, blitzed) It is so freaky... 
CHIEF SURGEON (stern for the staff's sake) Okay, lets stop yakking and get cracking. I want to go in at the upper thoracic. Then we'll work our way around. (slaps Ock's shoulder) Hang in there, man. 
INSERT: The WALDO nearest the slap moves ever so slightly. The triangular CLAW rotates a quarter turn and then turns back. 
The NURSE sees it and SCREAMS. 
CHIEF SURGEON (glares) Nurse! Number seven scalpel. Arthroscope stand by. Read out parameters in progress. Let's go in. You alright? 
NURSE Yes... Yes, of course. Everything's online. 
CHIEF SURGEON Scalpel! No... no... a larger one... the largest we have! 
She slaps a HUGE ONE into his palm. He takes a deep breath and goes to work. MASKED heads gather round him. The SCALPEL is poised at the line where skin meets steel. We make an incision. The INSTRUMENTS go crazy. WARNING BELLS and BUZZERS sound. 
HEAD NURSE Kill the alarms! 
BRAINMAN He's going off the chart! 
A WALDO flashes around the steel leg of the operating TABLE and clanks tight! 
CHIEF SURGEON Mop. Mop! Sutures and clamps! Hurry up! 
SURGEON #2 We're losing him. Defibrillate! 
A HEART MACHINE is rushed in. They work frantically. 
CHIEF SURGEON Zap him! 
BRAINMAN Stabilizing alpha waves... 
SURGEON #2 applies the CARDIAC SHOCK PADS. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY 
NURSE You have a visitor, Doctor... 
She leaves OCK and THORKEL alone. 
THORKEL (enjoying this) Octavius, I'm afraid I have bad news for you. 
OCK The cyclotron is damaged... 
THORKEL What used to be the cyclotron was permanently shut down this afternoon. 
OCK But my work! 
THORKEL Your work is a disaster! Look at yourself! 
OCK Myself? I don't matter. Nobody matters anymore. To enter a new dimension we must first destroy our own... 
THORKEL What are you saying? 
OCK gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with his 4 WALDOS and 2 arms. 
OCK Destroy life. Life is... insignificant. Bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. What would you say? 
THORKEL Oh, my God, what are those horrible things sticking from your body? 
The CROWD BOOS the slender newcomer who climbs awkwardly through the ropes. Rock music blares. TWIN REDHEADS in RED BIKINIS ring a bell. 
CRUSHER COLE and SPIDER-MAN circle. COLE is twice SPIDEY'S size. SPIDEY spots a TV CAMERA for the first time. He momentarily freezes. CRUSHER sneers the CRUSHER sneer. Then he charges! 
With the agility of a spider, SPIDEY leaps out of the way. CRUSHER comes back at him. SPIDEY leaps again, bigger! The acrobatics get more and more dramatic as CRUSHER COLE works himself up into a theatrical rage. Taunts erupt from the CROWD. 
OLD LADY Kill the sucker, Crusher! 
SPIDEY, really getting into it now, begins playing for the CAMERAS. 
HIPSTER (between two blondes) Whatsamatter, Crusher, can't you crush that bug? 
CRUSHER (to Spidey) Okay, Web Face, this is it! 
He misses SPIDEY again! 
HIPSTER Hey, Crusher, you need a insecticide! (his blondes titter) 
INT. LIZ/KIM'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
LIZ'S side is all schoolwork. KIM'S side is all ROCK POSTERS and STUFFED ANIMALS. LIZ is curled up doing homework. FLASH and KIM sit on the edge of the bed watching the "SLAMMIES" on MTV. 
FLASH Will you look at this Spider-Man guy! He is absolutely incredible! 
KIM Liz, get a load of this outfit! I wish I had it for the Halloween party... it's quite sexy. 
LIZ Will you two shush. I'm trying to work. 
INT. RING - NIGHT 
The match continues in an increasingly spectacular choreography. CRUSHER bellows at the SCREAMING CROWD. But there's a gleam in his eye. This is it! He charges. SPIDEY, playing the CAMERAS for all he's worth, leaps way, way up. But this time CRUSHER stops dead in his tracks. SPIDER-MAN comes back down into a forearm SMASH that sends him reeling into a corner. CRUSHER does a flying pin. 300 pounds. WOMP! The air leaves SPIDEY in a rush as CRUSHER covers him, smothering him. The CROWD goes WILD. 
REF One...! 
REISS Get up...! Get up...! 
REF Two...! 
Not realizing his own strength and panicky about being squashed, SPIDER-MAN throws CRUSHER COLE off him and up into the air. Way up! Reiss cheers... Spider-Man comes down and knocks CRUSHER for the first time. 
CRUSHER flies away and out of the arena, eight rows back! The HIPSTER sees CRUSHER coming at him and bolts from his seat. CRUSHER lands on it, in between the TWO BLONDES who break into utter hysterics. 
SPIDEY, surprised at his own strength, watches CRUSHER land. 
SPIDER-MAN (whispers to himself) Wow... 
REF Ladies and Gentlemen, history is made today, we have here the first man to win a thousand dollars against the mighty Crusher. 
The REF raises his hand in victory. The CROWD BOOS and DEBRIS rains down. But some in the CROWD CHEER wildly, recognizing the new sensation. 
SPIDER-MAN steps down from the right as REISS leads the CHEERS. 
PETER Max! Am I really gonna get a thousand... 
REISS We are going to get a thousand-- 
PETER turns with REISS and comes face to face with CRUSHER COLE. Two ominous beats. 
CRUSHER Hi, who are you, kid? 
PETER I'm Peter Parker. 
REISS He is Spider-Man, and I handle him... Whenever you want a rematch call me. Next time it's gonna be ten thousand, what do you say... Crusher? 
SPIDER-MAN Oh, look, Mr. Crusher, I'm really sorry about what happened in there. Really... 
CRUSHER Oh, well, I don't know what happened to me tonight... (measures his muscles) I really don't know... 
REISS I know... you lost. Big man you lost to the Amazing Spider-Man. 
EXT. CITY STREET - NEAR A HOSPITAL - DAY 
WE ARE TIGHT ON A NEW YORK JOURNAL TRUCK. On its SIDE BANNER is a PICTURE of SPIDER-MAN'S face. Headline: "Who is he? Mega-Smash Hits MTV!" 
The TRUCK pulls away and we see PETER, LIZ, HARRY and KIM standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross. PETER is rocking on his heels and smirking. 
PETER (indicating truck) You know who that is? 
LIZ (walking ahead) Yeah... he's some clown we saw on TV last night... boy does Flash think he's hot. 
PETER He does... 
KIM I love wrestling. 
HARRY Wrestling is all bluff. Do you really believe this little guy in a stupid Spider-Man suit beat the Crusher? 
LIZ Hey, we better rush... visiting hours will be over soon. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR & ROOM - DAY 
SPIDER-MAN You like wrestling? 
SPIDER-MAN jumps and reaches WEINER. 
WEINER I love it! You are the best wrestler I have ever seen... please don't hurt me! 
SPIDER-MAN picks up WEINER, throws him up to an antenna above the building, to which WEINER clings desperately. SPIDER-MAN circles the antenna. 
WEINER Oh, please... don't kill me. Please help me down. 
SPIDER-MAN Of course I'll help you down. I am Spider-Man... the good guy, am I not? 
WEINER Yes... yes, you are. 
SPIDER-MAN jumps to the CHIMNEY, picks WEINER up in his arms and whispers to him. 
SPIDER-MAN And by the way, Peter Parker does not live here anymore... 
SPIDER-MAN jumps with WEINER in his arms to the edge of the roof. 
SPIDER-MAN And tell the Professor he can't have Peter's data. Goodbye. 
SPIDER-MAN drops WEINER off the roof, three floors straight down into heavy bushes below. 
INT. ELECTRODYNE FACTORY SHOP - DAY 
A SIGN tells us so. A CLERK is double checking a long list of items OCK has ordered. 
CLERK Holy cow, whattaya building, fella, a cyclotron? (Ock glares at him) Okay... lets see here. Page three. We got 30,000 feet of 50-gauge copper co-ax... twin 550 XK transformers... cadmium accelerator rails, a half dozen... a GBC relative multi-phase transducer... and one yellow thermos. (finishes computation) That'll be $475,989.65... 
OCK Wrap it up... 
CLERK What about the money... or do you pay by credit card? 
OCK (a long beat) Cash! I'll be back soon. 
EXT. STREET - OUTSIDE OF A BANK - BACK DOOR - NIGHT 
An ARMORED TRUCK rolls by and stops. TWO GUARDS open the Bank's DOORS. 
Suddenly a WALDO smashes through the DRIVER'S SIDE WINDOW of the ARMORED TRUCK, wrapping around the DRIVER'S NECK and pulling him through the WINDOW. The SHOTGUN goes for his weapon, but a WALDO smashes in and pulls the GUN out through his WINDOW. 
TWO WALDOS shoot out and attach themselves to the REAR DOOR. 
BANK GUARD What's going on here? 
The WALDO knocks him over. OCK rips the DOOR off! The TRUCK is full of MONEY BAGS. 
OCK Cash! 
INT. JAMESON'S OFFICE - DAY 
A PHOTO ASSISTANT look on as JAMESON goes over PETER'S latest PHOTOS. They are his SPIDER-MAN shots. 
PETER Doesn't he look amazing in that one? Look, he's flying in the air! 
JAMESON I don't care if he flies to the moon. He's just another wrestler in a silly costume. Look at this, Parker, right off the wire. This is the guy who hit that armored truck this morning. They say he has metal arms... get me a picture of this character! 
PETER Metal arms? 
JAMESON Four of them. 
PETER Ock...?! 
JAMESON The web faced weirdo... He is a joke in a Halloween costume... don't make me laugh. 
He tears up PETER'S SPIDEY PHOTOS. 
JAMESON Now get out of here and don't come back without something I can use! 
PETER Yes sir... (stops, and turns back) 
JAMESON A mega baloney... A bug in blue tights... what next? 
PETER The Journal said he was a mega-smash on MTV... 
INT. CYCLOTRON ROOM - NIGHT 
WEINER is putting on a CLOWN SUIT. He fastidiously puts his ratty jacket on a hanger and hangs it on a PIPE. The PIPE turns into a snake. It is, in fact, a WALDO! 
OCK (turning from work) What do you think you're doing? 
WEINER I'm going to the Masquerade. It's Halloween tonight Doc, aren't you coming to the School Ball? Whoa, you could go without an outfit. 
A WALDO whips around WEINER'S throat... AARRRGH! 
OCK You're not going to any ball, clown. You're going to get me Peter Parker's data... 
WEINER I was almost killed on my last try... Look at all these bruises... 
LIZ I'm not... 
She reaches for HARRY'S hand. 
FLASH Holy jumping jelly beans, willya look at these pictures of Spider-Man? Wow! Is this guy great or what? 
LIZ looks. She shrugs. Then she shrieks. 
LIZ Hey, Peter! These are your pictures! 
FLASH Can't be... 
LIZ It says here "Photos by Peter Parker." 
PETER reacts, then looks over FLASH'S other shoulder. 
INSERT: There are three PHOTOS of SPIDER-MAN in the paper. PETER BLUSHES, smiling. 
FLASH (takes off his head mask) You know this guy, Parker? 
PETER Well, yeah... sort of... 
FLASH Wow... I'll give you anything if you introduce us. 
HARRY (to Liz) Will you grant me this dance...? 
LIZ joins him provocatively. 
KIM Hey, Flash-Man... Wanna dance...? 
FLASH Well, why not. 
PETER is left alone, PETER leaves toward the entrance. At the REAR DOOR a BIG LIZARD passes a NOTE to a DALLAS COWGIRL who passes it to a KANGAROO. The KANGAROO hops across the dance floor to the STAGE where he hands the NOTE to a YOUNG WOMAN in a BASEBALL UNIFORM. 
She climbs the STAGE where she is bathed in a SPOTLIGHT. She gets a DRUM ROLL from the band. There are some BOOS as the bad stops. 
YOUNG WOMAN Thank you, thank you. We have a special surprise guest tonight. (booo) The Empire State University Masquerade Ball presents... The "Slammy" winning star of MTV'S wrestling tournament... The Amazing Spider-Man! 
FLASH, amazed turns to LIZ. He points to himself and mouths, "Me?" (The REAL) SPIDEY drops from the ceiling and lands in a pose. The CROWD cheers. He does a flip to LIZ and extends a hand. The BAND starts up. LIZ demurs. 
FLASH (whispers firmly) Go ahead... go ahead! 
LIZ takes SPIDEY'S hand and they move slowly and sexily onto the dance floor. They do a short simple number. SPIDEY returns LIZ to FLASH. 
LIZ (to Flash) Come on... Flash... 
FLASH takes LIZ from PETER (SPIDER-MAN). 
LIZ and FLASH dance wildly. They finish to big cheers. The real SPIDER-MAN slides to center floor. The crowd backs away as SPIDEY spins out the greatest dance number in film history. He's all over the floor and on the walls and on the ceiling and on the GLITTER BALL. He takes LIZ and flies with her. He breaks the place up. Then drops in a pose. BIG CHEERS. 
LIZ stops breathless, very near to SPIDER-MAN'S face. 
LIZ (whispers breathless) Who are you...? 
PETER One day you'll know... 
LIZ (a long beat) You sound very familiar. 
PETER/SPIDER-MAN Sure I do... I'm your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man! 
He jumps away and disappears, leaving the CROWD aghast and LIZ in love. 
INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 
BEN is flicking through the channels of his TV, aggravated as usual. It's all ROCK VIDEOS! 
BEN (to May) What a bunch of crap. Goddamn rock and roll's screwed up the whole TV. 
He flicks off the set and turns to MAY who's asleep on the couch. He gently nudges her. 
BEN Come on, May. Wake up and go to sleep. 
EXT. TAXI - NIGHT 
It enters the EAST RIVER DRIVE. 
INT. TAXI - NIGHT 
As the city rolls by. 
SPIDER-MAN (fearful) Hey! Can't you go any faster? 
CABBIE What'm I in, a race? 
SPIDER-MAN (fighting his fear) I don't know... I get this tingling in my brain, like some danger is lurking just ahead. I'm worried about Aunt May and Uncle Ben... 
CABBIE Your family? 
SPIDER-MAN Well, they are kind of my parents. They raised me. I lost both of my parents in a car accident... please step on it! 
BEN Let go before I blow your brain's out. 
EXT. FOREST HILLS STREET - NIGHT 
The TRUCK pulls away leaving PETER in a POOL of STREET LAMP LIGHT. He's wearing a FOOTBALL JERSEY and SHORTS and carrying a SPORTS BAG. He begins to run. 
INT. BEN AND MAY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
MAY hears a CRASH. She pulls the covers up around her chin in fear. 
BEN (V.O.) Let go! 
WEINER (V.O.) You let go! 
EXT. BEN AND MAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
PETER runs up and hears a SHOT. He runs inside. 
INT. BEN AND MAY'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT 
PETER runs in. He sees WEINER standing there with the RIFLE. They face off across the room. The moment hits PETER like a punch in the chest. 
PETER Uncle Ben! 
BEN (a wheeze) Peter... 
PETER rushes to BEN. 
PETER Oh my God... Uncle Ben... 
PETER tries to revive BEN, while WEINER runs out. 
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - NIGHT 
PLASTIC FURNITURE, GARISH LIGHTING, CIGARETTES in the ASHTRAYS. 
AUNT MAY (a brave but fragile front) Ben gets through everything. He'll be alright. The doctors are... 
AUNT MAY and PETER embrace, leaning on each other for support. 
DETECTIVE (compassionate) Excuse me. You the nephew? 
PETER rises, nods. As AUNT MAY wipes away a sniffle... 
DETECTIVE Your uncle's a brave man. Apparently, the perpetrator was after something of yours. Your uncle didn't know what it was but he stood up to him anyway. You ought to be proud of him. 
PETER I am... how is he... 
A grim-faced DOCTOR walks slowly across the room to them... MAY stands up slowly. 
DETECTIVE Ask the Doctor. 
AUNT MAY How's my... how's my husband doing...? 
DOCTOR Mrs. Parker, I'm sorry. We tried. 
MAY collapses. 
DOCTOR Crash cart! STAT! 
The Detective pulls PETER gently away. The STAFF works on MAY. 
DETECTIVE Let the medics handle it. (pause) Look, if it makes you feel any better. We're gonna nail this guy. He crashed his getaway car. We got him trapped in a warehouse on Jackson. 
NURSE (to Peter) She's alright. She just fainted. We'll have to check her for symptoms of shock. If you want to wait, you can get some coffee on the third floor. 
PETER No, I... I think I wanna go out for some fresh air. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
COP CARS, COPS, SEARCHLIGHTS playing their BEAMS against the ACME CHEMICAL STORAGE BUILDING. GUNFIRE flashes from one of the WINDOWS. 
EXT. COP CAR - NIGHT 
ELITE COPS in BASEBALL CAPS are plotting strategy. 
COP #1 That place is loaded with solvents and chemicals. If we blast our way in, it's gonna go up like a roman candle. 
COP #2 We could go in through the fifth floor wash room. 
COP #1 What's that up there? Throw a light on that! 
COP #1 directs the BEAM of the SEARCHLIGHT. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE WALL - NIGHT 
SPIDER-MAN is climbing it, trapped in the GLARE of the SEARCHLIGHT. He freezes. 
COP #1 He's got a partner! 
OCK (smiling) Okey, dokey. 
OCK goes about checking out the CYCLOTRON. It looks good. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
OCK starts flicking switches and reading DIALS, doing a "mission countdown" for his next experiment. This place has been "hot rodded" to the max. 
OCK (reading dials and numbers) Amperage, okay. Flux, 14. Negative variable differential... good enough. 
He shuts it down. The WHINE whirs down. 
OCK Okey, dokey... now all I need is Parker's data. Where the hell is Weiner? Damn it... I can't trust anybody. (throws his Waldo in the air) Only you, my babies... only you can I trust... Okay... If I have to do everything myself... I'm going to do it. (to his equipment) I'll be back... my babies... my new babies! 
OCK hides the WALDOS under his coat and leaves the room. 
INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
There is more EQUIPMENT than before. PETER is deep at work. His SPIDER-MAN UNIFORM hangs on the WALL. There is a knock at the DOOR. 
LIZ (V.O.) Hey, Peter! Are you finished with my computer yet? I got a paper too, you know... 
PETER (panicked) Oh my God... oh, it's you, Liz... I didn't expect you... uh... give me a minute. 
He hides his SPIDER-MAN COSTUME. 
INT. THE HALLWAY LANDING - NIGHT 
LIZ waits impatiently. 
PETER (opening the door) Hi, Liz. Come on in. 
INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
LIZ enters, looking around. PETER covers for this and that. 
LIZ What were you doing in here? 
PETER (looking around) Cleaning up. Come on. I'll get your computer. Where's Flash parked? 
He picks up the COMPUTER and turns to her, but she's already looking around the apartment. 
LIZ Flash didn't come. 
PETER (holding it) Oh. Well... how are you going to get it home? 
LIZ walks into the room. 
LIZ Taxi... I guess. 
She discovers the PRINTS of SPIDEY that PETER has taped up around the apartment. 
LIZ You must spend a lot of time with this Spider-Man guy... Peter! Don't you think you ought to unplug that! 
PETER looks and sees that he is tethered to the wall. Embarrassed, he puts the COMPUTER back down. 
PETER (embarrassed) I, uh, I'll go down to the corner... see it I can hail that taxi. 
PETER leaves. LIZ smiles. She likes PETER. Why is he so...? 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
A SHADOW of a MAN can be seen hiding. PETER does not notice him. 
INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
There's a KNOCK at the DOOR. 
LIZ (crossing to it, wondering) Peter...? 
She is about to open the door when FOUR WALDOS smash through it, obliterating it. OCK stands in the shattered doorway, WALDOS writhing. 
LIZ Doctor Octavius...! You're... You're... (finds the words) You're so weird!... with those... what do you call those... 
OCK Waldos... Did you hear about Spider-Man? (moving Waldos like spider's legs) That's me... the real Spider-Man... now tell me, where is that jerky friend of yours... Parker? 
LIZ (protecting) Peter?... oh... he's not here. He's gone. I don't think he'll be back for awhile. 
OCK (running his Waldo in her hair) You wouldn't lie to your Professor now, would you? 
LIZ Of course not. Why would I lie about a thing like that? Really. He's... out. 
OCK We'll wait. OCK grabs LIZ'S HAIR with his WALDOS. 
LIZ What are you doing... let me go! Please... take those things out of my hair! 
OCK My Waldos, you mean. 
LIZ Whatever you call them... please... 
OCK (holding Liz) Who the hell are you? 
SPIDER-MAN Spider-Man. 
LIZ (seeing Spidey) Spider-Man... 
OCK That's a lot of crap, clown... I am Spider-Man, not you. (points to Liz) Ask you girlfriend. (to Liz) Tell him! 
SPIDER-MAN I'm a good friend of Peter Parker's Ock. Just like that girl you're holding. Now let her go. 
OCK thinks for a moment, then he begins to extend the kicking and screaming LIZ out over the street, ten stories up. 
OCK Let her go? What an excellent idea. If you do not deliver your friend, Mr. Spider-Man, yes. Yes, of course, I'll let her go. 
LIZ Put me down, you mechanical mutant! 
LIZ is having none of this. She kicks, she fights. She twists. She flails around, making things a little worse. The ground is yawning death beneath her. RRIIPP! PART of her BLOUSE tears away and LIZ plummets! SPIDER-MAN swoops down on a WEB-STRAND in his characteristic compound curve. He reaches out for the falling LIZ and misses her cleanly. The WEB is too short. 
LIZ (falling away) You jerk! 
He THWIPS her with a second WEB and together they swing to a HIGH GIRDER where he deposits her safe and sound. 
LIZ (straightening herself) Tell your friend Peter next time I'll get the taxi myself... 
OCK (screams) Hey... you jerk... you phony Spider-Man... Prepare to meet your death, bug. 
SPIDEY THWIPS a beam and swings across toward OCK. 
SPIDER-MAN (whispers) Actually, I'm rather fond of living... especially now... (he looks at Liz) 
He lands on OCK'S GIRDER and the two progeny of the cyclotron face off for the first time, ten stories above the street. 
SPIDER-MAN (a last appeal to reason) Octavius. Just stop and think. 
OCK I am thinking, insect. I'm thinking about exterminating you! 
SPIDER-MAN Okay, if that's the way you want it... Let's see what those chrome knuckles can do, Doc... 
A WALDO lances out and catches SPIDEY flush on the jaw. It knocks him to another GIRDER. SPIDEY hangs on and rolls over. He rubs his jaw. 
LIZ Great... 
SPIDEY gets ready to go into action and gets pummeled by another barrage of blows from above. 
OCK Now I must kill you, you cretinous clown. 
OCK throws a roundhouse WALDO that nearly knocks SPIDEY off the GIRDER. He's just barely hanging on. But SPIDER-MAN'S not done yet. He THWIPS a HIGH BEAM and swings into a better attack position. The two SUPER- ADVERSARIES engage in battle. 
With OCK swinging from his WALDOS like a metal monkey and SPIDEY swinging from his WEBS like, well, like SPIDEY, they clang and bang through the GIRDERS of the CONSTRUCTION SITE. 
OCK Once I dispose of you, Spider-Man, no one will be able to stop me. 
SPIDER-MAN Stop you from what...? 
OCK My destiny! 
OCK throws his biggest punch yet. 
SIRENS can now be heard in the street. 
SPIDEY avoids WALDO strike after WALDO strike. OCK eludes WEB after WEB. But SPIDEY'S agility soon has him turning circles. 
SPIDER-MAN Over here, Octopus! 
OCK That's Professor Octopus to you Spider Jerk! 
SPIDER-MAN Give it up, Professor. You'll never catch me! 
OCK takes three steps and soars through the air. 
EXT. BRICK WALL - NIGHT 
OCK, misjudging the leap, soars right past SPIDEY and into an alley! Screaming all the way... 
EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT 
OCK and TWO WALDOS pressed against each of the opposing walls. It's a tenuous grip. Then, very slowly, sparks flying from his WALDOS, OCK slides down into the alley. 
SPIDER-MAN So long, sucker. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
COP CARS pull up. COPS leap from them. 
EXT. SIDE WALL - NIGHT 
OCK makes it down, sees the COPS, ducks out of sight. 
EXT. COP CARS - NIGHT 
SPIDER-MAN Thanks. 
FLASH (realizing) By the way, what are you doing with... Liz? 
SPIDER-MAN She needed a lift. 
FLASH Oh... okay! This calls for a beer! A lot of beer! 
SPIDER-MAN Thanks, but I have some business to take care of. 
FLASH Well... take care of that later. Wait here. I'll get the beer. 
He disappears. LIZ comes, tentatively, to the WINDOW where SPIDEY squats, desire and passion in his WHITE EYES. 
LIZ (accusatory) How'd you know this was Flash's place? 
SPIDER-MAN Peter Parker told me all about it. 
LIZ Peter told you all about Flash? 
SPIDER-MAN No... he told me all about you. See you later. (he jumps away) 
INT. DORM - NIGHT 
FLASH comes in with more BEER than a man ought to carry. 
FLASH Hey, where'd he go? Hey, Spider-Man!! 
But SPIDER-MAN has disappeared. 
LIZ (distracted) Peter told your Hero all about me... 
FLASH He would, wouldn't he... that jerk! 
EXT. PETER PARKER'S ROOF - NIGHT 
SPIDER-MAN lands on it. He drops in the SKYLIGHT. 
INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
He drops into the room and pulls off his MASK. The place has been ransacked. COMPUTER DISCS are all over the floor. PETER pulls a file marked "Planetary Conjunction." He opens it. 
A piece of PAPER falls out. It says, "Kiss it goodbye, Wall Crawler!" 
PETER (whispers angrily) Octavius!!! 
EXT. EMPIRE STATE UNIVERSITY QUAD - DAY 
PETER is hurrying along. KIM in sunning herself wonderfully. 
PETER (hurrying by) Kim! Have you seen Harry? 
KIM Sure, lots of times. What a brainiac... 
PETER Yeah... have you seen him today? 
KIM No, un unh. 
LIZ (catching up) Peter...! 
PETER (keeps walking) Hi... have you seen Harry? 
LIZ No. What a night, huh? 
PETER (laughs) Yeah, that was some ride home... must have been pretty exciting. 
LIZ It was... okay. Look, I got two tickets to Les Miserables... wanna go? 
PETER Sorry... I'm really busy... I mean, not tonight... see you later. 
LIZ (thinking) Hey, Peter... how did you know about last night...? 
PETER What about last night? 
LIZ My exciting ride with Spider-Man... 
PETER Oh... Sorry... I gotta hurry... I have to find Harry... I'll see you later. 
LIZ Peter! 
PETER runs off. He sees a car approach and flags it. 
PETER Hey! Can I get a lift downtown? 
FLASH Take your shoes for a walk, Dork. 
FLASH gets out of his car, and crosses the lawn toward LIZ. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
SPIDEY arrives at the DOOR at the top of the CAR. He sees ROZ at the bottom. THREE PEOPLE are between them. The SKINNY GIRL sees SPIDEY. She screams. 
SPIDER-MAN Okay, folks, just hang on... 
He scampers down the GRAB-HANDLES to the people below. FOUR PASSENGERS cling to SEATS and BARS. 
SPIDER-MAN Okay, one at a time. You first, Ma'am... 
A FAT WOMAN makes a "who me?" gesture. SPIDEY throws her over his shoulder. 
INSERT: THE COUPLING which holds the two CARS at right angles begins to bend open. 
SPIDER-MAN, the FAT WOMAN over his shoulder, goes hand over hand to the top and the WOMAN is dumped into the MIDDLE CAR. 
INSERT: THE COUPLING bends open a little more. 
SPIDEY helps the TEENAGER and the SKINNY GIRL out of the CAR. She takes the dreadful step between cars. She looks down. She screams. She steps across. 
EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT 
The FIRE LADDER is up. But it is about TEN FEET short of where it's aimed at. The end of the CAR. A FIREMAN stands at its apex. 
FIREMAN (into walkie) Gimme more ladder! I need more ladder! 
WALKIE Negative on that, you're at full extension! 
INT. LAST CAR - NIGHT 
Now only ROZ is left. SPIDEY approaches him. He clings to a POLE. 
INSERT: The COUPLING bends open! The CAR is hanging there from memory! 
ROZ This is Doctor Otto Octavius' work. I must get back to my university. I must stop Ock... he's gone crazy. Can you help me? 
SPIDER-MAN Sure thing, just don't take the train. Come on... give me your hand. 
ROZ Spider-Man! Listen to me! If he can do this with the train, if he's come this far, then I can pretty well predict his next step. He'll go to Plutonium SL 270 for the power. He must be stopped... or else he'll destroy our world. 
The COUPLING shrieks and the CAR lurches. 
SPIDER-MAN Let's get you out of here first, Professor. 
ROZ Wait Spider-Man. I don't think I can make it... You mustn't waste time saving me... you must save the world! You must go and stop Ock! 
SPIDER-MAN Where can I find him...? 
ROZ He is looking for Plutonium SL 270 I'm sure... 
The CAR lurches on its side and ROZ flies out of the DOOR. SPIDEY THWIPS out a WEB that girdles ROZ'S waist. 
SPIDER-MAN Think Rosomorf, think where one can find Plutonium? Where could he find SL 270...? 
EXT. LUXURY CONDO HIGH-RISE - NIGHT 
ROZ is hanging in mid-air on the WEB. ROZ shouts. 
ROZ (shouting) There's only one place he can get the Plutonium SL 270... 
SPIDER-MAN Where...? 
ROZ Toxic... toxic dump... any toxic dump would have SL 270. 
SPIDEY swings ROZ in an arc to the FIREMAN. He misses ROZ on the first pass. ROZ looks up at SPIDEY who stands in the doorway, manipulating the WEB. 
The FIREMAN grabs ROZ. Then, with an awful SCREECH of steel, the CAR pulls loose from the COUPLING. With SPIDER-MAN inside it, the CAR plunges ten stories to the street below. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
COPS, FIREMEN, PRESS, the works. The CROWD GASPS. CAMERA STROBES pop as the LAST CAR crashes to the SIDEWALK. We hold several beats on the incredible rubble. 
Then, a WEBBED HAND. SPIDER-MAN groggily pulls himself from the wreckage. 
COP (V.O.) Put your hands up, Spider-Man. 
SPIDER-MAN You're making a big mistake. 
COP And you're looking at twenty years. 
SPIDER-MAN shoots a WAD of WEB GOO onto the COP'S GUN and leaps up onto the LUXURY CONDO... and swings up out of the frame. The COP aims and shoots. The BULLET makes a THWUMP noise. The WEB GOO stretches out about three feet and falls limp. 
COP What the hell! 
EXT. BACK OF BUILDING - NIGHT 
SPIDER-MAN swings painfully, one handed and limp, at the end of a WEB STRAND. After falling ten stories, he is groggy and weak. He can't think. He can't focus. He can barely hold onto his WRIST GIZMOS. This bug is spent. 
SPIDER-MAN Must go on... must find Ock... SL 270 Plutonium... must get that crazy old loony... before he gets to the Plutonium... toxic dump... where are the toxic dumps...? 
He hangs there with two hands to catch his breath and thinks. He shoots a WEB up diagonally and swings across on it. This time he catches on and holds, but barely. 
FLASH Spider-man! This is unbelievable...! 
SPIDER-MAN Flash, I need your help. 
FLASH You got it. 
SPIDER-MAN You any good with this thing? 
FLASH I'm the best. 
SPIDER-MAN Okay... catch that Vette! 
FLASH Roger, wilco, over and out. 
He swerves. SPIDEY falls all over LIZ. They begin to careen through traffic, three peas in a very small pod. 
EXT. WEST SIDE CAR CHASE MONTAGE - NIGHT 
With SPIDEY jammed in between LIZ and FLASH, the MG chases the VETTE. Since neither OCK nor FLASH is any good at this, both cars quickly careen into POLES, FENCES, HOT DOG CARS and begin falling apart. 
On RIVERSIDE DRIVE the MG begins to lurch and STEAM. The VETTE looks eaten away. The GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE looms ahead. 
The VETTE roars through the TOLL BOOTH. They spot OCK stuck in traffic. 
FLASH Why is he going to New Jersey, and who is it in that shitty red car... 
LIZ Don't you recognize him... it's Ock! 
SPIDER-MAN New Jersey has the largest toxic waste dump in the world. 
FLASH What does he want with toxic waste? 
SPIDER-MAN He's looking for Plutonium, my dear... The car has to slow down... it's in a traffic jam. 
FLASH Sorry... can't do anything about this traffic. 
SPIDER-MAN jumps out of the car. 
SPIDER-MAN Try to stay with me. I don't want to lose him! 
Speeding along the BRIDGE, OCK sees no one. But high above, SPIDEY swings from TOWER to TOWER after him. At the last TOWER, SPIDEY leaps down onto a BIG TRUCK. The VETTE weaves and SPIDEY crosses to another BIG TRUCK. For a moment he is caught between the TWO TRUCKS, but he makes it across. 
The VETTE takes an exit. SPIDEY leaps to the next SIGN. He aims his WRIST GIZMO and waits for the next car to take the exit, but none does. Deflated, he drops to the ground. He looks up to see a sign on a CYCLONE FENCE. It says, "DUMP NUMBER 7 -- KEEP OUT -- RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL!" 
SPIDER-MAN Bingo. 
INT. TOXIC WASTE DUMP - NIGHT 
The landscape has a nightmarish vision, weirdly lit by "safety lights." VATS and DRUMS ooze all kinds of bad stuff. A light is on in a dilapidated SHACK. 
INT. THE SHACK - NIGHT 
OCK is tossing away the CANISTERS until he comes to one marked, "HAZARD!! PLUTONIUM SL 270 HAZARD!!" 
OCK Okey, dokey... 
SPIDER-MAN Open that now, and you'll spoil Christmas. 
SPIDEY'S peering in from a HOLE in the ROOF. 
OCK Insect! I am going to squash you to death... Once I lay my Waldos on your skinny bones... 
OCK hurls a DRUM at SPIDEY. It erupts in a sizzle of LIQUID and GAS. Then the SIX-ARMED FIEND runs for the door with his SL 270. 
EXT. THE SHACK - NIGHT 
OCK comes flying out and SPIDER-MAN grabs a WALDO. SPIDEY does a back flip and whips OCK so hard the WALDO snaps off! OCK recoils it and reacts in horror. With a roar, OCK attacks SPIDER-MAN. They battle as SUPER-ADVERSARIES. OCK gains the upper hand and tosses SPIDEY into a pile of RUSTING DRUMS. A GAS envelopes SPIDER-MAN and he begins coughing. 
EXT. THE DUMP - NIGHT 
OCK'S WALDOS are coiled around SPIDER-MAN'S neck as the WEB SLINGER is dragged through the dump. His WHITE EYES narrow and blink. There is a capped WELL behind a WARNING SIGN. OCK tears off the CAP and then hurls the groggy SPIDEY down the WELL. 
OCK Goodbye, Spider-Man! 
INT. THE WELL - NIGHT 
SPIDEY falls. He cannot grab onto the slimy WALLS. At the bottom of the foul pit is a bubbling BLUE luminescent POOL. SPIDEY claws frantically at the WALLS. 
SPIDER-MAN Noooooooooooooo! 
He gets a hold and slides down to within a foot of the POOL. Its weird light shines up at him. He looks up at the starry sky. 
SPIDER-MAN (to himself) Okay now, Spidey. Easy does it. 
He shoots a WEB about halfway up the PIT. It hits the wall, sizzles, and drops back down. 
SPIDER-MAN (to himself) Don't give up, Spidey. Don't give up. 
The WEB GIZMO squirts out a pathetic patooey of WEB GOO. Then it hisses, empty! 
HARRY But don't worry... he can never use it without Plutonium. 
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.) He's got the Plutonium, and he's on his way back to the lab! And he's got two prisoners with him... Liz and Flash! 
HARRY Don't worry... he needs a huge amount of power... thousands of volts of electricity... to get to the Anti-Force. 
SPIDER-MAN He can get to the power. Electrical power... to the max. Nuclear power... SL 270. And now, at the moment of full Planetary Conjunction. When all the planets line up with the sun... maximum gravitational power. The Conjunction is Ock's final power source. 
HARRY Damn... the Conjunction is due at midnight! What are we going to do? 
EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT 
The BLUE MG arrives and comes to a stop. OCK looks at his two prisoners in the back seat and smiles to himself... Picks up one DRUM on each shoulder. 
OCK Okey, dokey... have fun, young ones... for the last time. 
OCK leaves. LIZ and FLASH are tied together in the back seat of the CAR. 
LIZ (still ministering) What do we do now? 
FLASH We kiss the world goodbye. If he is right, all there is left to do is... 
LIZ Wait... I think I can release my right hand... 
INT. PETER PARKER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
HARRY How much time is left? Wait... I can find out... my God... 59 minutes! 
INT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT 
SPIDER-MAN The only way we can interfere with Ock's plan is to find a computer center... fast. 
HARRY (V.O.) Our University has the biggest center in town. 
SPIDER-MAN Yeah, but who's gonna work 'em? 
EXT. UNIVERSITY GROUNDS - NIGHT 
Professor OCK comes for some more drums. He sees that LIZ and FLASH have disappeared. OCK picks up TWO DRUMS. HARRY seeing FLASH and LIZ come running to the school grounds. 
HARRY I think I can get some help... I can teach anyone how to work a code in five minutes. 
SPIDER-MAN (V.O.) Then do it! 
INT. COMPUTER LAB - NIGHT 
The LIGHTS are off, but the COMPUTERS are on. HARRY looks over LIZ'S shoulder as she cracks through a code. Her SCREEN reads out, "CONNECTICUT. TECH. Fully Op, Line Backlog, Security Max Level." The last line is FLASHING. 
KIM Hey, this is easy. 
They all run from COMPUTER to COMPUTER. 
FLASH Hey, Harry I need help. 
HARRY Coming! 
HARRY types in KARNAKY LTD and gets the same response. He looks at his DIGITAL WRISTWATCH. "01:00:02" becomes "00:59:59" as we watch. Then a WARNING BUZZER! 
KIM I got one! I got one! 
LIZ Harry! Get over here! 
HARRY hurries to KIM'S side and elbows her out of the CHAIR. The SCREEN is flashing "WARNING, Security Breach!" HARRY'S hands fly over the keys. The KIDS gather around. LINE DRAWINGS of the CYCLOTRON (progressing from large to small detail) appear one after the other. Finally, a PIPE. There is a CIRCLE around a JOINT. And the legend "H20". 
HARRY A goddamn water leak... 
FLASH Hey, look at this. Empire State University. This is our cyclotron, right? 
HARRY (serious) What does it say? 
FLASH (hits two keys) It says "no information on net." 
HARRY Damn... we can't do it... 
KIM You mean... we can't stop loony Ock... 
HARRY I mean the world is in danger... 
FLASH We must find Peter, he knows these computers better than all of us. 
HARRY Yes, but where the hell is he? 
LIZ (mysteriously) I bet he is with Spider-Man... 
Suddenly the lights dim. A heavy noise. An earth quake. 
EXT. OUTER SPACE - PERPETUAL DARK 
The EARTH is moving into line with the other PLANETS of the CONJUNCTION.

"HUNTER" 
FADE IN 
1     EXT. OUTER SPACE                                       1 
The infinite blackness punctuated by a billion stars. As we slowly DESCEND through the varied shades of blue of the Earth's atmosphere, we HEAR the first strains of a haunting, Central American FLUTE, joined by a swelling background of JUNGLE SOUNDS.  We descend further, through a lush JUNGLE CANOPY, backlit by a setting sun. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
2     EXT. JUNGLE COASTLINE - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)               2 
Through a collage of shimmering HEAT-WAVES, a dark, OTHER-WORLDLY OBJECT drops INTO VIEW, backlit by the fiery, ORANGE-RED sphere of a setting tropical SUN, heading slowly towards us, floating, as if suspended by the rising heat of the jungle. 
Continuing to approach, the shimmering object resolves into a MILITARY ASSAULT HELICOPTER, its rotors strobing in the fading sunlight.  Drawing closer, the SOUND of powerful TURBINES, throbbing in the heavy air, becomes dominant, overpowering. 
Guided by COLORED SMOKE and LANDING LIGHTS, the chopper looms hard INTO VIEW, pitching forward and settling to the ground, kicking up a maelstrom of dust and vegetation 
2-A   INT. COMMAND POST - DAY (MAGIC HOUR)                   2-A  * 
Where a MAN wearing a military UNIFORM watches through the large open windows the helicopter as it continues to approach.  Before the skids have even touched down he SEES the first of the MEN, dressed in CIVILIAN CLOTHES but carrying full COMBAT GEAR, alight gracefully from the chopper, double-timing in close order to one side, the orders SHOUTED by one man lost in the ROAR of the chopper. 
The man turns away from the window, to a FIGURE, hidden     * in the shadows. 
MAN                                 * He's here. 
He turns back, lowering a BAMBOO SHADE, obscuring the       * window. 
2-B   EXT. HELICOPTER PAD - NIGHT                            2-B  * 
On adjoining PADS, two other HELICOPTERS are VISIBLE; in the b.g. can be SEEN several concrete and THATCHWORK BUILDINGS, a secret command post disguised as a COASTAL FISHING VILLAGE. 
The post in a flurry of activity, AMERICAN ADVISORS shouting directions to dozens of LATIN AMERICAN SOLDIERS who stand by to assist the landing helicopter and to load EQUIPMENT into the other choppers. 
Inside the chopper, one man remains, stretched out against  * the bulkhead, as if asleep.  He stirs, sits up, lighting    * up a CIGAR.  With fatigue showing in his motion, he leans   * forward, descending to the ground.                          * 
A JEEP pulls to stop, the man swinging casually into the    * front seat, tossing his GEAR into the rear.  With a         * lurch the jeep heads out towards the command post.          * 
In the doorway TWO MEN solemnly watch as the jeep approaches.  Reaching the command post the man alights from the jeep, heading towards the two men. 
Into the pool of light cast by the fixture above the door steps MAJOR ALAN SCHAEFER, the team leader, 38, an intelligent and intense man.  He informally salutes, GENERAL H.L. PHILIPS, 55, hardened, close-cropped graying hair, his nameplate and insignia identifying him as a member of an elite commando unit in the U.S. Army.  He clasps Schaefer warmly on the shoulder. 
PHILIPS (with affection) You're looking well, Dutch. 
SCHAEFER It's been a long time, General. 
They walk up the stairs, entering the palapa, leaving the other man on guard. 
3     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                      3 
Large, two room concrete floor, thatched walls and roof. Behind a partially drawn curtain in the kitchen, a naked lightbulb hung from the rafters illuminates a bank of compact FIELD RADIO EQUIPMENT, MAPS and AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS.  Otherwise the rooms are primitive and stand out in stark contrast to this high-tech invasion. 
Philips and Schaefer enter the room. 
SCHAEFER Like the old days, Dillon.

DILLON Also heard that you passed on that little job in Libya. 
Schaefer looks at Dillon, quietly considering him. 
SCHAEFER Wasn't my style.  We're a rescue unit, not assassins. (smiles) This must be good.  Big shot from the CIA, leaves his desk to come back to the bush. What's so important? 
DILLON Those cabinet members are very important to our scope of operations in this part of the world.  They're about to get squeezed.  We can't let that happen.  I needed someone who could get the job done, quick and quiet...no screw-ups.  I needed the best. The best.  So, I pulled a few strings at the State Department...and here we are. 
SCHAEFER Go on. 
Dillon goes to the map. 
DILLON The set-up is simple, Dutch. One day job.  We pick up their trail at the chopper, run 'em down, grab the hostages and bounce back across the border before anyone knows we were there.  You've done it a hundred times.  Nothing out of the ordinary. 
Schaefer considers this. 
(CONTINUED) 
3     CONTINUED:  (5)                                        3 
SCHAEFER And nothing we can't handle alone. 
Philips breaks in. 
PHILIPS I'm afraid those are your orders, Major.  Once you reach your objective, Dillon will evaluate the situation and take charge. 
Schaefer looks from Philips to Dillon.  He still doesn't like it. 
DILLON Not to worry, Dutch.  I haven't lost my edge.  They've got a head start on us in some real tough country, otherwise, believe me, it's a piece of cake. 
PHILIPS Gentlemen, we're losing time. (to Schaefer) You'd better get your men ready. (pause) Good luck, Major. 
4     EXT. TWO ASSAULT HELICOPTERS - NIGHT                   4 
Burst over the top of a ridge.  Rising up in silhouette they perform a radical left bank turn and descend rapidly into an adjoining valley, racing over the jungle at treetop level. 
As the helicopters perform dizzying, high-speed maneuvers through the winding canyon, the PILOT'S VOICES can be HEARD, coordinating their operations. 
PILOT ONE (voice over) Redbird Two, Two.  Bearing south, three, five, zero, one o'ckock on the saddle ridge. Over. 
(CONTINUED) 
4     CONTINUED:                                             4 
PILOT TWO (voice over) Roger, Blue Leader.  Three, five, zero, on your move. Over. 
The helicopters rise in perfect coordination over another ridge and bank sharply into the next valley, leveling out as they go. 
5     INT. HELICOPTER - NIGHT                                5 
Illuminated by the eerie red glow of NIGHT LIGHTS, are SEVEN MEN, dressed in jungle camouflage, soft hats and camouflage face-makeup.  They wear no identity badges or insignias.  The man are checking their WEAPONS, making last minute adjustments to their GEAR. 
The compartment reverberates with the NOISE of the THUMPING ROTORS and the ROAR of air from the open doors. 
BLAIN, weapons and ordinance specialist, a frightening bull of a man, a 240 pound killer, removes from his shirtpocket a think PLUG OF TOBACCO.  He looks across at: 
MAC, a huge bear of a man, black, holding am M-60 MACHINE GUN.  Blain holds out the tobacco to Mac who refuses with a gentle shake of the head, a knowing smile, he knows what's coming. 
Holding the plug between his teeth Blain yanks free from his shoulder scabbard a wicked, ten inch COMBAT KNIFE.  Placing the razor sharp blade next to his lips he slices through the plug as if it were butter.  He chews throughtfully. 
Seated by the open doorway is RAMIREZ, a slight, angular man, an East L.A. streetwise Chicano. 
Adding a final piece of camouflage TAPE to his pack HARNESS, he looks up and smiles, faking a throw and the bulleting the tape to: 
HAWKINS, the radioman and medic, Irish, street-tough, reading a rolled-up magazine, as if he were a rush hour commuter.  He snags the tape with an instinctual snap 
(CONTINUED) 
As the assault team passes below, a BUTTERFLY lands on what appears to be the BARK of a TREE.  It fans its wings and flies on. 
The impression of the butterfly remains in PERFECT RELIEF, as is imprinted on the bark.  The image fades, REVEALING for an instant a gridwork of TINY SCALES on the bark. 
The bark moves!  Changing colors, like a chameleon, REVEALING for an instant the form of something alive as it flows into the leaves, once again becoming indistinguishable from the surrounding foliage. 
TWO EYES, faintly flowing yellow, appear in the foliage.  They blink, disappearing, and then become VISIBLE again.

SEEN THROUGH HEAT-SEEKING VISION, studying the team's careful, silent movements at they pass by. 
The SOUNDS of the FOREST are also ALTERED and ENHANCED with an electric, STATICLIKE quality. 
The Observer scans over the men...and then focuses on Schaefer as he crouches down, signaling forward and rear with a circular motion.  He refers to an OBJECT in his hand, studying it carefully. 
22     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   22 
Using a MAP in lining out a course on his COMPASS.  The other team members appear, silently, clustering around him.  Using hand signals, Schaefer indicates a course change. 
23     EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. - DAY                          23 
Watches closely as Schaefer continues with his hand signals, instructing his team.

26     EXT. DENSE UNDERGROWTH - DAY                          26 
The hillside of a steep valley, dark and foreboding. Billy passes by and halts, removing his KNIFE.  With his other hand he pulls down from overhead a THICK VINE, severing it.  A thin stream of WATER emerges which he drinks. 
Suddenly he stops, letting the water drip to the ground.  He quietly releases the vine and brings his M-203 shotgun to bear, listening intently.  Something seems wrong.  He brings his eyes upward and stares, hard into the treeline of the opposing hillside. 
As his eyes strain to penetrate the dense, intertwined canopy, he is engulfed by the rising SOUNDS of the JUNGLE, a cacophony of BUZZING and CLICKING, amplified in the sweltering heat of the day.  Unable to locate a source to account for his anxiety, he relaxes, moving on, resuming the track. 
27     BILLY (MINUTES LATER)                                 27 
examines the ground as he moves, growing confused and puzzled by what he sees before him.  He stops, scrutinizing the jungle, probing the world around him with his keen senses. 
HEARING a faint RUSTLING SOUND he looks up, SEEING a curtain of MOSS several feet away.  He takes a cautious step forward, extending his weapon.  He reaches forward with his free hand, touching the moss. 
Behind the curtain a slight shifting of DARK FORMS occurs.  He pauses and then with a sudden movement, sweeps the moss aside... 
A BLACK EXPLOSION of FLUTTERING WINGS as carrion-eating BIRDS rush past Billy's body. 
(CONTINUED) 
27     CONTINUED:                                            27 
Billy's face seizes into a mask of horror, his expression descending into a state of complete, primitive shock, his eyes staring transfixed, inches away from the leering death-grin of a HUMAN FACE, upside down, completely stripped of skin. 
Reeling, his body numbed by the sight before him, he stumbles backwards and stops. 
Vines threaded through their achilles tendons, the BODIES OF THREE MEN, skinned and gutted, hang suspended in the think, suffocating air, BUZZING with insects. 
Billy turns away, revulsed as Ramirez moves quietly INTO VIEW, Schaefer directly behind him.  Ramirez stares at the bodies, now seen to be in the first stages of deterioration, strips of flesh torn away by the birds and other scavengers.  In an almost childlike manner, he crosses himself. 
RAMIREZ (hoarse whisper) Holy Mother... 
Schaefer moves into the clearing, kneeling beside a bloody pile of CLOTHING and ENTRAILS.  He examines the clothing and then rises, holding a DOG TAG on a broken chain.  He reads the tag, his face growing hardened and bitter as he stares down at the tag, recognizing the name. 
SCHAEFER (to himself) J.S. Davis, Captain, U.S. Army... 
Schaefer's eyes move from the bloody dog tag to the bodies. 
SCHAEFER (coldly) Mac.  Cut them down. 
Mac moves forward, withdrawing his COMBAT KNIFE. The blade flashes, cutting the vine as the first body THUDS to the ground.  He bends over, picking up other DOG TAGS. 
Schaefer turns to Dillon. 
Dillon at once goes into a defensive position, listening.  The jungle is SILENT.  He stands and starts to move forward.  Suddenly Mac appears within inches of Dillon's face.  Mac's face is menacing, angry.

30     CONTINUED:                                            30 
MAC (hissing; barely audible) You're ghostin' on me, mother fokaaa!...I don't care who you are back in the world... You give away our position again and I'll bleed you quiet and leave your fuckin' ass right here. (hisses; spits) Got it? 
Dillon's eyes are wide and fixed, staring back in cold hatred at Mac, controlling his rage...he knows the rules. 
Not waiting for a response, Mac turns and vanished into the jungle.  Seething with anger Dillon focuses on a still moving LEAF and STEM, indicating Mac's exit point.  He moves on. 
31     EXT. BLAIN - DAY                                      31 
Crouches under heavy foliage, waiting.  He is joined by Mac.  They glance briefly at each other, scanning in opposite directions for movement and sounds.  They speak in whispers. 
BLAIN Say, Bull.  What's goin' down? We got movement? 
MAC No.  Shithead with his trenchcoat and dee-coda-da ring was makin' enough noise to get us all waxed.  I don't like that guy.  Don't like him at my back.  I ain't winding up like those bastards back there. 
Mac, sweating heavily, wipes the moisture from his brow with his finger. 
Blain pats the mini-gun affectionately. 
BLAIN I know what you mean, Bull, but don't sweat it, me and 'ol 'painless' here are watchin' the front door. 
(CONTINUED) 
31     CONTINUED:                                            31 
MAC As always, bro... 
They do a gentle fist dap and smile warmly at each other.  Two men who have seen it all, through a dozen no-win situations, and have lived to tell about it. 
Mac advances a few meters and signals slowly. 
32     EXT. KNOLL                                            32 
The assault team moving up the hill, barely visible in the heavy foliage, the team moves cautiously into defensive positions.  Holding. A moment later they continue up the hill, crawling. 
On their stomachs, Schaefer and Ramirez clear the edge of the knoll, SEEING below a GUERRILLA VILLAGE, a huge, spreading PALAPA covering implacements dug into a hillside, descending to a winding stream bed below.  30 MEN, dressed in a mixture of jungle fatigues and civilian clothes, armed with AK-47 ASSAULT RIFLES move about the camp.  A heavy MACHINE GUN emplacement guards the entrance to the camp.  TWO MEN sit in the camouflaged emplacement. 
33     SCHAEFER                                              33 
sweeping the camp with BINOCULARS, SEES a GUARD above the camp.  One of the man picks up a hand-held ROCKET LAUNCHER, placing it beside a bandolier of ROCKETS and a RADIO SET and CONSULS taken from the U.S. surveillance helicopter as if preparing to take them away. 
Schaefer puts down the glasses, looking at Ramirez who nods in acknowledgment.  A sudden MUFFLED CRY brings Schaefer's attention to one end of the camp, where a heavily thatched DOOR covers and opening to the PALAPA.  A GUARD stands at the door. 
The door flies open as a HOSTAGE, shirtless, hands tied behind his back, staggers through the door as if kicked from behind.

33     CONTINUED                                             33 
The man falls to the ground, feebly trying to regain his footing.  Although difficult to see from Schaefer's vantage point, the man's battered face and welt-covered back indicate he has been severely tortured. 
Emerging from the palapa, a GUERRILLA LEADER, moustached and wearing a SIDEARM, approaches the beaten man, kicking him viciously in the stomach, rolling him to his side. 
Kneeling beside the man he withdraws an AUTOMATIC from his holster and cocks the hammer.  Grabbing the man by the hair he jams the muzzle into the man's ear and with a violent twist, pulls the trigger. 
The guerrilla leader stands and strides quickly back to the palapa, still holding the pistol, closing the door behind him. 
34    SCHAEFER                                              34 
grim-faced at having witnesses the murder, lowers him glasses, a look of cold determination on his face. Quickly he and Ramirez ease down the escarpment, joining the other team members. 
Schaefer makes a circling motion with his thumb and the team members gather in close, huddle formation. 
SCHAEFER (whispering; angry) Just killed one of the                             * prisoners.  No time for                            * invitations.  We take them, now. 
35     EXT. BLAIN AND MAC - DAY                              35 
Watching as Schaefer pulls the pin and launches the GRENADE into the air, the Observer following its arc as it spirals dead-center into the camp, bouncing twice before rolling into the FUEL DUMP...which a moment later, EXPLODES into an incredible FIREBALL. 
The expanding FIREBALL released from the explosion is to the Observer like an erupting sun, momentarily blinding him. 
47     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             47 
The truck is BLOWN up into the air by the explosion... a moment later the satchel charge DETONATES with an ear-splitting EXPLOSION, tearing the truck apart. 
48     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                   48 
Jumps to his feet, FIRING an M-203 round into the camp. 
49     EXT. KNOLL - DAY                                      49 
Schaefer races down the hillside, joined by Dillon, leaving Hawkins to cover them.  Bullets burst around their feet as they run low, firing short bursts to his left and right. 
(CONTINUED) 
49     CONTINUED:                                            49 
He FIRES the undermounted GRENADE LAUNCHER, sending a round into a gun position in the trees.  Still running he breaks open the breach, slamming in another 40mm ROUND from the cartridge pack at his waist. 
Blain and Mac fire the heavy machine guns, laying down a withering curtain of lead, shredding the camp, taking out five Guerrillas at once. 
50     EXT. GUERRILLA CAMP - DAY                             50 
A MAN almost completely ON FIRE is hit by an onslaught of GUNFIRE, ripping him back into the jungle. 
Ramirez cuts loose a barrage from the SIX-SHOOTER... seconds later the MACHINE GUN IMPLACEMENT erupts in a series of EXPLOSIONS, blowing two Guerrillas into the air. 
At the HILLSIDE HUT, two Guerrillas move into position by the window, drawing down on Schaefer as he appears, racing down the hill. 
As they are about to open fire, Dillon appears, YELLING OUT a warning. 
DILLON On your nine!!! 
Schaefer dives, hitting the ground as Dillon OPENS FIRE taking out the Guerrillas.  Schaefer rolls to his feet, spins, firing the 203 grenade launcher, completely destroying the hut. 
51     EXT. ALTERED P.O.V. - DAY                             51 
As the Observer regains its vision an eerie, surreal experience of sight and sound unfolds: 
BULLETS streak through the air, leaving blood-red trails of HEAT, like laser blasts.  As they impact into the Guerillas, we HEAR the enhanced SLAPPING of BULLETS, SEEING tiny blossoms of HEAT mushroom out of their bodies. 
We HEAR the horrific, deformed CRIES and SCREAMS of the dying men. 
Another searing, blinding EXPLOSION sends pieces of SHRAPNEL ripping through the air, some of them ROARING past the Observer's position, like tiny meteors. 
52     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE                                52    * 
at the entrance way to the main palapa, a Guerrilla stands in the doorway, giving COVER FIRE to his comrades as they fall back inside. 
Jumping from the roof of the adjoining palapa, Billy drops directly in front of the Guerrilla. 
From the side, unseen by Billy, another Guerrilla           * thrusts out with a knife, Billy ducking backwards, the tip of the knife SLASHING his face.  With a lightning move, Billy whips his arm up and around the Guerrilla, locking his elbow, breaking the joint. 
Still holding the man he FIRES, blowing the other Guerrilla off his feet with the SHOTGUN portion of his weapon.  He looks at the Guerrilla out of the corner of his eye.  He suddenly strikes, breaking his neck, dropping him in a heap. 
Billy continues on, racing down the stairs, firing the M-203. 
Meanwhile, Blain is crouched next to a tree, providing      * cover.  Behind Blain, at the edge of the camp, circling around from below, TWO GUERRILLAS appear and FIRE a grenade round which EXPLODES behind Blain, fragments ripping into the tree next to which Blain is standing, bark and dirt flying as shrapnel rips into his vest, one piece tearing into his upper shoulder.  The hits have no effect on the huge man and with a savage GROWL, he spins, opening fire, raking the two attackers with the Mini-gun. 
Nearby, Mac charges from the jungle on a dead run, diving over a fallen tree as machine gun FIRE rakes the ground around him. 
Blain, spotting the sniper high in a tree, opens FIRE with the MINI-GUN, shredding the tree, sending the Guerrilla crashing down through the roof of the palapa. 
53     INT. PALAPA - DAY                                     53 
The sniper CRASHES through the roof, landing on the floor near Hawkins and Ramirez who do a quick double take before opening fire on a group of fleeing Guerrillas, taking out two, giving chase to the others.

SCHAEFER (closes eyes) Shit... 
He checks her pulse and then slowly he bends to pick up her PISTOL, ejecting the clip.  He stands, beginning to shuffle through the PAPERS scattered about the room. Staring at one he looks up, the pieces falling together. 
54     EXT. JUNGLE - DAY                                     54 
Ramirez, at a crouch, runs through the jungle, following the obvious signs of the Guerrilla's retreat.  He emerges from the trees into an opening, leading to a sheer rock cliff, towering fifty feet above the ground.  Scanning the wall, he SEES movement and quickly takes cover, as automatic FIRE rips up the ground before him. 
54-A   EXT. ROCK WALL - DAY                                  54-A 
Near the center of which a narrow cut, two feet wide, leads to the top of the cliff, giving access to the adjoining ridge. 
Two Guerrillas scramble up through the chimney, assisted by a ROPE, which with withdraw as they reach the top.  Ramirez takes out one man, the other taking cover, returning fire. 
54-B   EXT. BASE OF ROCK WALL - DAY                          54-B  * 
Blain joins Ramirez, behind cover at the foot of the cliff.  As they take cover, Ramirez notices the wound on Blain's shoulder. 
RAMIREZ You're hit.  You're bleedin', man. 
Blain looks briefly at the wound. 
BLAIN (spits) Ain't got time to bleed. 
On a signal, they both clear cover and fire LONG BURSTS from their weapons up the cliff. 
(CONTINUED) 
54-B   CONTINUED:                                            54-B 
The smoke is hardly cleared when they are answered by withering FIRE.  They duck down as a grenade EXPLODES nearby.  Ramirez quickly replaces the 40MM rounds into the SIX-SHOOTER. 
BLAIN Son of a bitch's dug in like a Alabama tick... (spits) ...jack us around all day. 
RAMIREZ Hell, dude, we don't have all day. 
Ramirez immediately rolls into the line of fire, BLASTING six RAPID-FIRE shots on a HIGH-ARC trajectory towards the rocks.  Blain reacts. 
BLAIN Shit, Pancho!!! 
Blain dives against the protective cover of the rock wall, covering his head.  Ramirez casually hops across, squatting next to Blain.  They make eye-contact. 
RAMIREZ What's your problem, dude? 
Before Blain can answer, Ramirez puts his fingers into his ears and grimaces just as... 
The entire hillside EXPLODES, blowing the Guerrillas into the air, a torrent of vegetation and earth raining down the cliff, obscuring Blain and Ramirez. 
55     INT. PALAPA ROOM - DAY                                55 
Schaefer is staring out the window, his weapon slack in one arm, still holding the paper.  Dillon enters, obviously excited about what he has found.  He sees the papers on the floor.  He reads through them quickly, growing even more excited.

Schaefer turns, striding slowly to Dillon, handing him the paper he is holding. 
SCHAEFER I think this is the one you want. 
Dillon reads it. 
DILLON (reacting) Two days...that's all we had. In two days, three hundred of these bastards would have been equipped with all this.  After they crossed the border, it would have taken a year to stop them. (looks up) We've averted a major guerrilla invasion, Dutch... 
Schaefer moves in close to Dillon, face to face, anger flaring in his eyes. 
SCHAEFER (slow; deliberate) It was all bullshit.  All of it. From the start...you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work. 
Dillon grabs the handset from Hawkin's radio, shoving it at Schaefer. 
DILLON You're still under orders, Dutch.  You want to make the call, or should I? 
Schaefer looks at the handset.  Then at Dillon, he knows Dillon's won.

He starts to walk away but stops, turning back, pointing a finger at Dillon. 
SCHAEFER I'm getting my men out of this damn jungle, Dillon.  She's your baggage.  You fall behind, you're on your own. 
56     EXT. GUERRILLA VILLAGE - DAY                          56 
Schaefer and Billy are kneeling on the ground near the trailhead, studying a MAP.  In the b.g., the team, hidden, covers the hillside approaches to the camp, nervous and wary, weapons ready. 
SCHAEFER This place is too hot for a pick-up. They won't touch us until we're over the border.  We can lift at LZ 49, here. (points to map) Spotter plane says we're cut off. (points to map) Except for this valley. 
Billy shakes his head, following the CONTOUR LINES of the rugged terrain. 
BILLY Looks bad, Major.  It's gonna be a real bitch. (points to map) If we follow above the river and then down, here, at this canyon, we might find a way out. 
Schaefer turns to Ramirez, kneeling close by. 
SCHAEFER (decisively) Not much choice.  Pancho, take the lead.  Double time it. 
He turns and looks at Dillon, Anna as his side, her forehead bandaged, her hands bound in front of her. He turns back to the others. 
SCHAEFER Lock n' load, watch your ass. 
Blain moves out, swinging the Mini-gun in front of him as he goes. 
56-A   EXT. OBSERVER'S P.O.V. - DAY                          56-A 
Watching as Dillon leads ANNA onward, SEEING her bound hands.  Dillon pushes her. 
57     EXT. ANNA - DAY                                       57 
Spins, hurling a string of insults to Dillon in SPANISH. 
ANNA (in Spanish) You touch me again, pig, and I will cut off your balls! 
DILLON (in Spanish) It's a long walk back, make it easy on yourself. 
She spits at him, turning forward with a twist of her head. 
Dillon picks up his back, shouldering it.  As they move on, Mac calls out to him. 
MAC (quietly) Hey, Dillon, over here. 
Dillon doesn't respond. 
MAC (louder) Dillon, over here. 
Dillon turns and approaches, warily, holding the girl. 
DILLON Yeah, what is it, Sergeant? 
MAc unsheathes his knife.  He gives Dillon a cold look and turns him by the shoulders.  Crawling across the PACK on Dillon's back is a huge SCORPION. 
Mac skeweres the scorpion with the tip of his blade, holding it before the wincing Dillon.  Anna smirks, nodding to the writhing, stinging insect. 
ANNA (in Spanish) When my people catch you, you'll wish you were him.

Dillon looks at Mac. 
DILLON Thanks. 
Have fallen behind, Dillon looking worriedly ahead at the them out distancing them.  Anna is keeping her pace purposefully slow.  She trips on a root falling to the ground.  She lies there, motionless. He quickly reaches down to haul her to her feet.

DILLON (urgently) Shit.  Come on... 
Like an uncoiled spring, Anna turns, flinging a handful of DIRT into his face, momentarily blinding him.  She lunges for his rifle with her bound hands. 
Suddenly the BARREL of an MP-5 is thrust into her face. 
Looking up she SEES Ramirez, calmly holding the weapon on her, the look in his eyes indicating he'd hove no trouble shooting her. 
RAMIREZ (in Spanish) Don't try it. 
She looks back at Dillon, wiping the dirt from his eyes. She moves on.  Ramirez gives him a cold look as Dillon hurries past. 
RAMIREZ (coolly) You should put her on a leash, Agent Man.  If you can't handle her, just say the word. 
Dillon moves on, ignoring Ramirez, who turns, scanning the jungle behind him before moving on.  Dillon catches up with Anna, turning her sharply by the chin. 
DILLON (cold; in Spanish) Try that again.  Please.                           * 
She looks at him contemptuously, undaunted.  She will try it again.  She breaks away from his grasp and moves on, Dillon watching her go, he won't hesitate next time.

As he travels, directly overhead, timing his movement with those of the team.  He moves lower, closer to the slowly moving humans. 
64     EXT. RIVER BED - DAY                                  64 
The team moves cautiously through the winding stream bed, now wearing their clothing in various stages of disarray for comfort, sweat dripping from their bodies.

Billy, in the lead, picks his way along the riverbank, his concentration rapt, aboriginal.  His face a trancelike mask of expectation. 
Blain, cradling the heavy Mini-gun as if it were a toy, swings the weapon relentlessly across his field of view.  He pauses to adjust the hanging, belted loop of cartridges trailing from the back pack magazine.  An INSECT lands on his face and is trapped in the grease paint near his lips.  He draws the hapless bug into his mouth with his tongue and quietly spits it out, his concentration unbroken. 
Mac follows, holding the M-60 high across his chest. 
Schaefer, bent, cautious, his feet moving aside the dry leaves on the ground, heel to toe and on foot edges.  He glances around, checking the team's position and progress. 
Hawkins follows, his mouth open, breathing deeply, exhausted, the radio a 60 pound demon. 
Anna, struggling to climb a section of the stream bank, slips on some loose dirt.  Unable to assist herself with her hands tied, she nearly falls. Dillon prods her with his rifle, forcing her to her feet.  She scrambles up the bank, Dillon following. 
65     EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY                                 65 
As Billy enters a small clearing, bordered on one side by the towering trees, carpeting the mountainside.  High above in the thick, impenetrable treeline, brightly colored birds SQUAWK loudly, chasing each other from branch to branch. 
Suddenly Billy stops.  Schaefer holds up his hand and the team freezes in position.  An eerie SILENCE, like a slowly falling curtain, descends over the jungle until even the BUZZING and CLICKING of insects have CEASED. 
66     EXT. TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                               66 
Sensing an ambush, move quietly into the foliage. Dillon moves into the undergrowth, dragging Anna with him.  He slings his MP-5 over his shoulder, withdrawing his KNIFE.  Grasping Anna by her shirt collar and pushing her to the ground he holds the weapon near her throat.  Dillon signals to Ramirez          * who approaches.  Dillon hands Ramirez the knife.

DILLON Watch her. 
Before Ramirez can respond, Dillon slips into the undergrowth.  Ramirez holds the knife on Anna, cautiously scanning around him for movement. 
HEARING Ramirez' cry, Schaefer signals to Hawkins to move.  Hawkins moves out, fast, heading towards the sound... 
77     EXT. HAWKINS - DAY                                    77 
SEES Anna running away.  He gives chase. Anna, although bound, is light and fit and runs fast, hurdling fallen logs and branches, charging through the undergrowth.  SHe has a good start. 
Hawkins, hampered by the radio and weapon but in tremendous shape, thunders after her, closing the distance. 
78     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            78 
As he passes from behind a large tree, surrounded by dense foliage, SEEING the fleeing Anna.  He watches her and then begins to move parallel with her, only faster, the green of the jungle rushing by in a blur. 
79     EXT. ANNA AND HAWKINS - DAY                           79 
Anna, bursting through a grove of ferns, drives on, breathing hard with the exertion. (CONTINUED)

Hawkins, ten yards behind, closing the distance, taking advantage of any hesitation Anna makes, struggling with the dense jungle. 
Anna hits a small clearing, an alleyway through the trees.  She sprints hard across the clear ground. 
80     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                            80 
Moving through the jungle.  As he steps clear of the foliage he SEES Anna driving hard into the alleyway, running directly towards him.  Twenty yards away, Hawkins, closes in. 
81     BACK TO SCENE/HAWKINS                                 81 
Only a few feet behind Anna, lunges forward, knocking her to the ground.  In a second he's on her, his weapon ready.  She struggles to her feet, fighting, gasping for breath.  Hawkins holds the MP-5 on her, looking at her, almost pleading.  He doesn't want to shoot her, but he will if he has to. 
HAWKINS Please... 
She looks at the weapon, to Hawkins and then, hopefully, to the jungle.  She stops, staring hard down the alleyway.  Something...suddenly she sees it! 
ANNA (in Spanish) Look out, behind you!!! 
Hawkins spins... 
82     EXT. HAWKINS AND ANNA'S P.O.V. - DAY                  82 
SEEING the MOTTLED OUTLINE of the Hunter's body, racing towards them, as if the entire wall of the jungle were rushing in.  The Hunter's WEAPON flares to life.

HEARING the GUNFIRE, Schaefer WHISTLES low and sharp. Ramirez, face bloody, swings into action, moving in a coordinated defensive/offensive pattern into the jungle. 
86     HAWKINS/BACK TO SCENE                                 86 
The Hunter's ARM and SPUR hook into Hawkins' leg, and he is dragged into the jungle.

Ramirez runs forward ten paces, drops to a crouch, scanning to each side.  Immediately Schaefer runs forward twenty paces.  As he passes Ramirez, Ramirez turns and scans the rear and flanks. 
Dillon, Mac and Blain repeat the maneuver, leap-frogging forward, canvassing the jungle, providing areas of intersection cover. 
88     EXT. RAMIREZ                                          88

Crouched in the undergrowth.  There is a movement in the brush before him.  He wipes the sweat from his eyes and clicks his safety on the Mini-gun to fire. 
The SOUND is growing closer.  Blain levels the weapon. A smile crosses his face. 
BLAIN (whispers) Come on in you fuckers...come on in.  'ol 'painless' is waitin'... 
The movement in the brush is GROWING LOUDER.  Blain's finger moves closer to the trigger. 
Suddenly a small TAPIR bursts through the leaves, startling Blain.  He relaxes momentarily as he watches the animal scurrying from sight.  He stands...

SOMETHING grazes his shoulder, a gout of BLOOD erupting. He starts to turn, the Mini-gun held low, ready to fire... 
...from out of the jungle, 75 feet away, the Hunter's WEAPON streaks toward him like a missile.  He SCREAMS as it enters his back, erupting from his chest in an EXPLOSION of BLOOD. 
93     EXT. MAC - DAY                                        93 
Has heard Blain's cry.  He moves fast through the brush. He HEARS a RUSTLING in the bushes.  A wet SUCKING SOUND. Mac charges into the clearing.  In the instant before the Hunter disappears into the forest, Mac SEES a vision so brief and fantastic that it seems like a hallucination. 
The Hunter's EYES flare momentarily from the green before they vanish. 
Mac sees his friend, lying on the ground, his chest open, the powerful man, dead. 
MAC (shouting) Contact, 30 Right!!! 
He OPENS FIRE with his M-203, belted shells slamming into the weapon from the magazine at his waist, expending it in one LONG BURST. 
94     EXT. THE OTHER TEAM MEMBERS - DAY                     94

He throws down the weapon and with a cry of rage, lunges forward, grabbing the Mini-gun.  As he stands, the CARTRIDGE BELT, attached to Blain, strings out between them. 
He opens FIRE and the foliage before him EXPLODES with the fury of the terrible weapon.  Mac sweeps the Mini-gun from left to right, like a man possessed, mowing down the jungle. 
The other team members race INTO SIGHT and begin firing with Mac.

97     BACK TO SCENE/MAC                                     97 
More FIRING.  Mac, his weapon expended, continues to thrust the Mini-gun forward, still squeezing the trigger. 
Suddenly, as quickly as it started, THE FIRING STOPS. The men move catlike into the jungle, reloading, searching, their nerves taut, stretched to the limit, ready to fire again at any second. 
Mac is frozen, eyes wide, unblinking, his breath coming in rapid gasps as he stares into the jungle, still squeezing the trigger of the weapon, its breech locked open, GUNSMOKE wafting from the chamber and barrel. 
Schaefer moves in front of Mac, still staring into the jungle.  Dillon pushes Anna into the clearing, moving towards the body.  Anna looks at the body and then up to Mac.  Schaefer sees a terrifying moment of recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to stare at Mac.  He turns to Mac. 
MAC (confused) I...saw it. 
At these words, Anna reacts in shock, drawing a             * slight breath.  Schaefer turns, sees her staring at         * Mac.  He turns back. 
SCHAEFER You saw what? 
MAC We've got most of the flares, frags. and two claymores just outside.  Nothin's comin' close to here without trippin' on somethin'. 
SCHAEFER Thank you, Sergeant. 
Mac starts to go but Schaefer places his hand on his shoulder. 
SCHAEFER I'm sorry, Bull.  It's never easy.  He was a good soldier. 
MAC (hardened) The best friend I ever had. 
Mac turns and walks through the camp, stopping beside a DARK OBJECT on the ground.  He kneels beside the PONCHO pulling back the zipper REVEALING Blain's face, looking peaceful in death, as if lying in state. 
Mac removes something from his pocket, holding it in his hand, studying it. 
103     DETAIL OF OBJECT IN MAC'S HAND                       103 
The small WHISKEY FLASH, the chrome rubbed away in places REVEALING the brass beneath and a MEDALLION depicting the 101 1ST AIRBORNE DIVISION. 
104     MAC                                                  104 
takes a tiny sip from the flask.  He replaces the cap and lifts the flap of Blain's shirt pocket, placing the flask inside.  He lingers on the face and then closes the zipper. 
MAC (softly) Good-bye, Bro. 
105     ANNA                                                 105

A momentary HUSH falls over the symphony of night sounds.  Anna and Billy turn towards the trees with a growing look of wariness.  The others, setting up the RADIO, show no response. 
108     INT. HUNTER'S SHIP - DAY (DUSK)                      108 
The Hunter's foot steps on the upper leg of the corpse, the PREHENSILE SPUR digging deep, pinioning the body to the ground.  The Hunter's HAND extends, his FINGERS puncturing the skin at the base of the spine, gripping the vertebrae. 
With otherworldly strength the arm pulls, the entire SPINAL COLUMN ripping free from the body, a sickly SNAPPING and POPPING of cartilage separating from bone and tissue.

He puts down the phone, turning to the group, huddled together in a tight circle, Ramirez and Billy facing outward in defensive positions, Anna, silent, watching. Schaefer is look at him. 
DILLON (angry; shocked) We're still too far in, they won't risk coming in for us. 
SCHAEFER Expendable assets, Dillon. Seems Langley is never around when you need them. 
DILLON I can accept that, it comes with the job. 
SCHAEFER Bullshit.  You're just like the rest of us. 
Dillon glares back.  Schaefer leaves, lost in thought. Ramirez looks up at the impenetrable canopy. 
RAMIREZ Shit load o' good a chopper'd do us in here anyway.

A FORCE FIELD that permeates the jungle, becoming one with the trees and foliage.  The Hunter walks down a CORRIDOR of SOLID LIGHT, leading to an opening to the jungle.  As the Hunter reaches the doorway he changes from visible to invisible, moving on into the night. 
113     EXT. ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT                              113 
The mist has thickened, the night alive with a million JUNGLE SOUNDS.  The team members sleep uneasily, if at all. 
Mac, although weary, stares hard into the night, waiting, each small sound a potential enemy.  A LULL spreads over the jungle, animals and insects QUIETING. Mac tightens his grip on the Mini-gun. 
Billy awakens, peering into the night.  Nothing. 
Suddenly, a metallic CLICK, a POP, the SOUND of a warning flare rocketing into the canopy.  A moment later a brilliant FLASH as the flare burns, illuminating the camp. 
An echoing eerie SCREAM fills the night as a DARK SHAPE in the mist rockets through the undergrowth towards Mac. 
Mac spins, hauling the heavy gun around, just as something crashes into his upper body, driving the huge man into the foxhole. 
A desperate battle for life ensues, illuminated with the strobing light of the descending flare.  Mac's enraged SHOUTS and ROARS mingled with horrific SCREAMS fill the night. 
Mac's razor-edged KNIFE slashes in the light; BLOOD spatters his face as he attacks fiercely.

Schaefer and Ramirez rush at a crouching run towards the foxhole, their weapons ready. 
A tremendous climatic SCREAM from the foxhole AND THEN, SILENCE.  Schaefer and Ramirez approach, cautiously. Mac stands, his face and clothes drenched in blood, some of it his, his breath coming in rapid gasps.  He looks at Schaefer, whispering hoarsely. 
MAC Got the motherfucker... 
As the flare breaks through the canopy, dying out in great flickering bursts, the man stare down into the foxhole.  A huge, jungle BOAR lies mutilated in a pool of blood, still quivering in the final throes of death. 
The flare dies out. 
Mac, shaking from adrenalin, breathing heavily, looks down at the dying animal. 
MAC (incredulous) A pig...just a fucking pig... 
Schaefer shines his TEKNA-LIGHT onto the boar, playing the light along its massive hulk, its razor edges tusks gleaming in the light.  Ramirez appears by his side, looking down at the huge carcass. 
RAMIREZ Holy shit, Mac. 
Nearby, unnoticed by the men, Anna stoops, her hands still bound, picking up an MP-5 from the ground.  She turns, looking for an avenue of escape, running for the jungle. 
But the forest looks foreboding and sinister.  She stops, staring at the jungle, the moonlight reflected off leaves like a thousand eyes.  For a brief second she imagines she can see the Hunter's eyes, crashing towards her, the shifting patterns of light and dark making the jungle seem to strobe, like it is about to rush in at her.  She freezes, paralyzed by fear, by her memories of the attack. 
She drops the MP-5 to the ground. 
Back at the foxhole, Schaefer and Ramirez help the still shaken Mac from the hole.  Schaefer looks at Mac, at the huge gash across his chest.

Suddenly he remembers, Anna. 
SCHAEFER Where's the girl? 
They all turn, ready to move and then stop.  Coming forth from the shadows Anna appears, still frightened, seeking the security of the soldiers. 
The Hunter utters an unearthly SNARL and HISS from his open mouth as an instant later his camouflage resumes and he vanishes from sight...a rapid, furtive movement through the trees.

Mac OPENS FIRE with the M-60, the others joining in, shredding the foliage, but they know the creature is gone. 
With a SHOUT, Mac races into the jungle, in pursuit of the Hunter. 
SCHAEFER Mac! 
Schaefer hurriedly ejects the spent clip from the M-203, slamming in a new one.  He shouts an order to Billy. 
SCHAEFER (to Billy) Get Ramirez on his feet!  Take the girl and get the hell out of here! 
He turns to run after Mac.  Dillon steps in front of him, putting his hand on Schaefer's chest. 
DILLON No way, Dutch.  I'm going. You get these people and get the hell out of here. 
SCHAEFER This isn't your style, Dillon. 
DILLON Guess I've picked up some bad habits from you, Dutch.  Now don't argue with me, you know I'm right.  Get to that chopper and hold it for us. We'll be along. 
SCHAEFER You know you can't win this one. 
Dillon stares at him. 
DILLON You know me, Dutch, I never did know when to quit. 
Dillon turns and begins to move out.

SCHAEFER Dillon! 
Dillon turns.  Picking up the spare MP-5, Schaefer tosses the weapon to Dillon, who grabs it with one hand.  They share a look, knowing this is farewell. 
SCHAEFER I'll see you there. 
DILLON Right behind you. 
Hefting both weapons at the hip he runs into the jungle after Mac.  Schaefer watches him leave.  He breaks and goes to Ramirez, attended by Anna and Billy, who is now sitting up, holding his ribs and gasping for breath. 
BILLY He's busted up, bad, Major. 
RAMIREZ (gasping) I can make it, Major. 
Schaefer lifts him to his feet, supporting him. 
SCHAEFER Come on, Poncho, we're getting out of here. (to Billy) Billy, take the radio, leave the rest.  Come on! 
119     EXT. MAC - DAY                                       119 
Creeping low to the ground, his eyes searching through the trees. 
MAC (whispered) Come on, you motherfucker! 
120     EXT. DILLON - DAY                                    120 
Moving through the underbrush HEARS a slight RUSTLING in the foliage.  Mac?  He strains to locate the source of the movement. 
He HEARS A SOUND, too faint at first it identify.  He listens.  Silence.  He hears is again, the SOUND of a VOICE, barely audible.  A VERY QUIET WHISPER.

VOICE (o.s.) Dillon, over here. 
Dillon locates the direction of the voice and moves towards it. 
He hits the bottom branches of the list line of trees, impacting crosschest on a large BRANCH, knocking his wind out. 
Semi-conscious, he hangs momentarily before he slides off, fingers digging into the bark, falling another ten feet into the swiftly moving river. 
150     EXT. RIVER - DAY                                     150 
Weighted down by his boots and clothing, Schaefer struggles to stay afloat.  Gasping for air he ducks underwater, untying one of his boots.  He surfaces, fills his lungs and dives again, releasing the other boot.  He surfaces, strips off his shirt and pants and begins to swim towards shore, stroking with one arm. 
151     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           151 
As he nears the edge of the precipice from which Schaefer has fallen.  The Hunter in close pursuit does not hesitate but LAUNCHES himself off the cliff in a spectacular LEAP, streaking downward towards the tops of the trees that grow out from the canyon wall. 
The Hunter tears through the canopy of the first tree, the branches and leaves rushing past in a KALEIDOSCOPIC BLUR. 
The Hunter bounds off of one branch after another, moving through the trees as an expert skier might negotiate a series of downhill gates. 
The Hunter leaps free of one tree, bounds across twenty feet of open space to a large branch of a huge tree, affording a good view of the river below.  From his vantage point, looking down at the windening, slowing expanse of river, Schaefer is nowhere to be seen. 
152     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  152 
He is swept into a still FASTER CURRENT and is carried helplessly downstream.  Boiling WHITEWATER appears.

152     CONTINUED:                                           152 
Out of control he is swept through a series of rapids, pulling his further and further downstream until he is finally ducked into the undertow and hurled over the top of a six foot falls, driven deep underwater by the pounding force of the water. 
153     EXT. POOL AT BASE OF FALLS - DAY                     153 
There is no sign of Schaefer.  Precious seconds pass. Slowly, looking like a drowned rat, he surfaces, taking a feeble breath.  He is nearly finished, his energy sapped.  But the water is calm and a few strokes are enough to carry him near the shore.  His feet hit bottom. 
He tries to stand but pitches headfirst into the thick MUD SLURRY at the river bank.  With his last ounce of strength, he crawls, panting and gasping into a sheltered mud OVERHANG, collapsing beside the exposed ROOT-SYSTEM OF A DEAD TREE, his body completely covered in thick, gray MUD. 
Nearly unconscious, he raises his head and looks to the opposite side of the river, scanning the bank.  There is no sign of the Hunter.  He collapses in relief.  He's escaped. 
Suddenly, the Hunter impacts the water, throwing up a huge SPLASH.  He stands up in the waist deep water.  As the water streams off of his body, the chameleon effect rapidly changes, struggling to match the shifting color patterns of the shimmering water. 
His glaring yellow orbs stare directly at the spot where Schaefer lies helplessly trapped. 
The Hunter surges forward, relentlessly closing in on this prey. 
154     SCHAEFER                                             154 
is frozen in terror, paralyzed with fear, his eyes locked ontothe incredible creature that is about to kill him. 
155     EXT. HUNTER - DAY                                    155 
Closing rapidly, another ten feet.  He leaves the water and walks through the mud, stopping, towering over Schaefer. 
156     EXT. SCHAEFER'S P.O.V. - DAY                         156 
As the Hunter's feet surge though the mud and stop, three feet away. 
157     EXT. SCHAEFER - DAY                                  157 
Realizing his life is about to end, closes his eyes, awaiting the Hunter's killing blow. 
158     EXT. HUNTER'S EYES - DAY                             158 
The fierce yellow orbs look downward. 
159     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - DAY                           159 
He's looking directly at Schaefer, EXCEPT HE CAN'T SEE HIM. 
He can clearly see the EXPOSED ROOT-SYSTEM, but because of the heavy mud blocking Schaefer's body heat, Schaefer registers in the Hunter's vision as merely an indistinct lump of clay, unrecognizable to the Hunter as a human being. 
He scans the bank, searching, looking for heat sources. 
Detecting none he moves on sounding a questioning TRILL several times. 
160     BACK TO SCENE/SCHAEFER                               160 
Holding his weapons in one hand, he moves up the canyon, ascending into a rising boulder field. 
167-A   EXT. BOULDER FIELD - NIGHT                           167-A 
Where the river flows into a series of falls and pools, surrounded by massive boulders and table top rocks, their crevices jammed with large amounts of DRIFTWOOD swept down at high water from the forests above. 
On a flattened section of rock, Schaefer drags a large section of BRANCHES INTO VIEW, adding it to a growing mound of FIREWOOD.  He kneels, tending to a pile of DRIES GRASS, LEAVES and other tinder.  Using the last of his precious matches, he sets fire to the tinder, gently coaxing the tiny blaze into a slowly consumming FIRE, flames starting to lick upward through the dry wood. 
He stands, staring into the rapidly growing blaze.  He turns, facing the canyon rim, raising his weapons in one hand.  From the depths of his soul, a SOUND emerges; primitive and visceral, as if from an animal in pain. 
He throws back his head and SHOUTS. 
168     EXT. CANYON RIM - NIGHT                              168 
A hundred feet below, Schaefer stands in the boulder field, his mud coated body bathed in RED FIRELIGHT, looking like a fierce, primitive warrior; a timeless, prehistoric sight, his long and WAILING CRY, ECHOING endlessly through the canyon. 
169     EXT. HUNTER'S SHIP - NIGHT                           169 
Backlit by the LIGHT of the open door, the Hunter's head, in three-quarter profile, his eyes gleaming, rears INTO VIEW, looking up at the sky, HEARING Schaefer's cry.

169     CONTINUED:                                           169 
Responding with a low HISS, he turns back, raising in one hand his weapon, in the other a U-shaped SHARPENING DEVICE.  As he passes the weapon through the device, it FLASHES into life, a deep, HARMONIC HUM emitted as the blade grows with energy, growing hotter, hotter and HOTTER with each stroke.  He draws the blade now WHITE-HOT through the device for the last stroke.  He lifts it, testing its balance, the WHITE-HOT blade illuminating his alien face. 
170-                                                 OUT     170- 
178     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - JUNGLE - NIGHT                178 
Emerging from his camp, the Hunter swings into the nearby tree line, moving to the uppermost branches. The Hunter travels silently from tree to tree, arriving at the canyon rim where far below he SEES in the canyon, the BONFIRE, a leaping, shifting, multi-colored collage of HEAT WAVES and FLARES, luring him onward. 
179     SCHAEFER                                             179 
hidden back within the deep notch of several large LOGS and broken trees, in the river canyon.  Below him, on the rock plateau, is the bonfire, illuminating in SHIFTING PATTERNS of LIGHT, the awaiting arena of destiny. 
His eyes shift, trancelike, moving from side to side, watching the approaches to the fire below.  His senses are alert; his nerves on a wire edge. 
180     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  180 
His SHADOW-FORM descending through the canyon, a rippling movement of grays and blacks, passing through the shifting light patterns on the rocks, cast by the growing bonfire below. 
181     EXT. HUNTER'S P.O.V. - NIGHT                         181 
His eyes probe the canyon, drawn to the swirling patterns of HEAT given off by the gaseous COMBUSTION of the bonfire. 
182     EXT. HUNTER - NIGHT                                  182 
Continues on, moving silently down through the canyon. 
183     SCHAEFER                                             183 
sits motionless, nearly invisible in his mud camouflage amid the darkness of the logs. 
Suddenly, over the CRACKLING of the FIRE, the BUZZING, CLICKING of INSECTS, and the CROAKING of FROGS, suddenly CEASES. 
Slowly, painfully he draws the bow to full arch, his wounded shoulder trembling, the BLOOD beginning to seep through the bandage. 
The bow straining at full draw, Schaefer stares intently, concentrating, searching for the Hunter's form in the dancing light below. 
183-A   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-A 
Like a giant insect, drops from above, fifteen feet above Schaefer, his steel-like spurs digging deep into the log. 
183-B   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-B 
He freezes at the sound of the Hunter dropping, his eyes wide with fear.  The slightest movement will bring an instant attack from the Hunter behind him.  But to wait, his back exposed. 
183-C   EXT. THE HUNTER - NIGHT                              183-C 
Jumps from the log above and to Schaefer's left, onto a boulder, gaining a better vantage point of the arena and fire below.  He raises his weapon, his EYES glistening in the dim light, searching.  A quiet HISS emerges from his mouth. 
183-D   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                183-D 
204     SCHAEFER                                             204 
pauses before the opening of the passageway.  All is silent.  He hesitates to enter.  Listeneing.  He starts to move and then hears a NEW VOICE: 
HUNTER (o.s.; Mac's voice) Dillon, over here... 
Schaefer, horrified at the sound of the dead man's voice, backs quickly into the space between a boulder and the high rock wall of the ampitheater. 
205     INT. HUNTER - SOMEWHERE IN THE BOULDERS - NIGHT      205 
His feet moving quietly over the rock, the shadow-light deepening with the dying fire above, closing in. 
205-A   EXT. SCHAEFER - NIGHT                                205-A 
Bow drawn, trapped against the rock, HEARING the sound of the Hunter approaching from the left, now the right, is helpless, not knowing where to fire, the Hunter's deadly strike only an instant away. 
Still holding the bang-stick in his bow hand, he carefully releases the draw on the string, reaching to his neck for the FLASH-GRENADE.  With painstaking care he removes the grenade from his neck. 
Focusing on the rocks before him and the still approaching SOUND, he reaches down with the grenade, gripping with his fingertips the matchhead fuse, placing it against the rocks at his side. 
With a sudden jerk of his hand he strikes and throws the grenade, snatching up the bang-stick with his good hand.

205-A   CONTINUED:                                           205-A 
The matchhead SPUTTERS as the grenade flies through the air, an instant later a blinding, WHITE FLASH of light illuminates the ampitheater... 
In that instant Schaefer SEES above him and to his left, the HUNTER, poised on top of a rock, his weapon raised, about to strike!  Momentarily blinded by the flash of light, the Hunter's head recoils to the side. 
Darkness swallows the image of the Hunter, but in that second, Schaefer seizes his advantage, hurling the bang-stick spear. 
206-                                                 OUT     206- 
214     INT. THE SPEAR - NIGHT                               214 
It smashes into the boulder at the Hunter's feet.  The Hunter leaps as the grenade DETONATES, shrapnel tearing into his body. 
With a terrifying SCREAM of pain and anger, the Hunter clutches frantically at the WOUNDS in his neck and chest.  Another bloodcurdling SCREAM OF RAGE and the Hunter is gone. 
215     INT. WATERFALL - NIGHT                               215 
Cascades over the rocks, fed by a small stream running through the ravine.  A pile of BOULDERS breaks the falls, filling the area with an everconstant MIST. 
Schaefer appears, holding the bow and arrow, following the LUMINOUS BLOOD TRAIL of the Hunter over the rock. 
Moving behind the falls, Schaefer's body is briefly soaked by the water, the hardened and CAMOUFLAGE beginning to dissolve, running off his body.  He continues on, slowly, cautiously following the blood trail. 
216     INT. TABLE TOP BOULDER - NIGHT                       216 
Next to the flowing stream, surrounded by an open area of rock. 
Schaefer, smeared with blood and sweat, his clay and ochre camouflage partially washed away, climbs up a log onto the boulder.  Oblivious to the searing pain in his

shoulder, he breathes in hot, powerful exchanges, his eyes wide and glowing with vengeance. 
SCHAEFER Bleed, you bastard. 
His bow down, Schaefer follows the blood trail across the rock, edging alongside a huge vertical boulder. The blood trail stops. 
He takes another step forward, past a darkened ALCOVE... 
Schaefer spins, SEEING in the alcove the SURPRISED Hunter whirl and spring towards him... 
Schaefer in a bound closes the distance, savagely kicking the Hunter's arm.  The WEAPON flies from the Hunter's hand CLATTERING to the rock. 
Before he can recover, Schaefer follows with a karate kick to the chest, hurling the Hunter to the ground, his back exposed. 
In a flash, Schaefer is standing over the Hunter, the bow drawn, poised, the blood from his open wound dripping onto the Hunter's back. 
He approaches it, wide-eyed, his senses reeling with astonishment and rage. 
From within the force field, a PASSAGE WAY of BLUE LIGHT appears, the Hunter's form backlit as he ascends the RAMP to his spacecraft. 
225-                                                 OUT     225-

as he passes his hand through a light BEAM, the ship instantly responds, as a low, TURBINELIKE HOWL is HEARD, building slowly in volume and pitch. 
228     SCHAEFER                                             228 
in his weakened condition staggers forward, looking up, SEEING the passage way of light diminish as the door begins to close. 
As rising HEAT WAVES begin to envelope the ship, the Hunter stares out at Schaefer, the heat waves increasing as the KEENING WHINE of the ship's drive builds.  He enters the force field, the door now inches from closing. 
On the ground, nearly obscured by the grass and leaves, Schaefer SEES the Hunter's WEAPON, lying where he dropped it in his desperate flight to escape.

Schaefer grabs up the weapon and holds it.  How the hell does it work?...He squeezes the handle of the weapon feeling it resist.  Nothing happens. 
With the last ounce of his strength, and with a BELLOW of RAGE, his arm muscles bulging, he crushes down on the handle... 
In a FLASH of blue-white light, the weapon becomes ACTIVATED. 
Schaefer raises the weapon, sensing its power and function. 
In the final seconds before the door closes, Schaefer, with a triumphant SCREAM, fires the weapon... 
The weapon, flaring with deadly energy, drops and turns sideways, accelerating through the door and into the spacecraft. 
229     INT. SPACECRAFT - DAY                                229 
The weapon impacts the Hunter, his head EXPLODING in a fountain of orange blood and pale green tissue. 
The weapon continues on, burying itself into the energy field, bolts of plasma-energy begin arcing from the force field. 
Schaefer falls forward onto his hands and knees, staring at the Hunter's ship.  The SOUND of the hyper-drive continues to increase, as the ship begins to tremble. 
230     EXT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT - DAY                        230 
As suddenly the instrument panel goes wild, gauges spinning, digital readouts racing out of control. The SOUND of the turbine faltering, changing pitch. The pilot lurches forward with the stick, fighting for control.

A blinding purple FLASH blows the ship to pieces. 
232     EXT. HELICOPTER - COCKPIT - DAY                      232 
Enveloped in the flash of intense light.  CRIES of surprise fill the ship as the SHOCK-WAVE hits the chopper, heeling it hard over to one side. 
Below, the concentric waves of energy race outward from the center of the blast, an unearthly sight, like the miniature birth of a star. 
The helicopter suddenly regains control, its power restored. 
PILOT Holy, fuck, what was that...?!!! 
PHILIPS Orbit right...check it out! 
The helicopter levels out and heads toward the smoking, devastated site of the blast.

EXT. RUDY'S - NIGHT 
It's New Year's Eve at Rudy's, a hole-in-the-wall dive. People stream into the bar to celebrate. Outside, CARL KENDALL (30s) and his soon-to-be ex-girlfriend KATH are having a quiet intense discussion. 
KATH You don't do anything more. You used to be fun. Now you hardly ever even leave your apartment. 
CARL I'm here, aren't I? 
KATH That's because it's New Year's Eve. You have to be here. Besides, it's not only social stuff. You used to have dreams. You wanted to go to business school, you wanted to work for the World Bank. 
CARL So I discovered b-school's not for me. People grow. 
KATH Growing is "X is not for me so I'll do Y." You went X is not for me and so I guess I'll sit on the couch for the rest of my life. 
CARL (ACQUIESCING) Well, look, this sucks, but I understand where you're coming from. 
KATH This is the problem. You don't even care that I'm breaking up with you. 
CARL Of course I care.   But I also understand. 
KATH You shouldn't just understand. You should be mad. Or upset. Or sad. Or something. 
CARL We're at different places in our lives. I get it. 
KATH Your girlfriend of two years breaks up with you right before New Year's Eve and all you can say is "I get it?" It is completely within your right to call me a bitch. 
CARL That would be inappropriate. 
KATH (tearing up) I can't believe I've been dating someone so emotionless. 
CARL C'mere.   It'll be OK. 
Carl hugs her. 
INT. RUDY'S - MOMENTS LATER 
Rudy's is a dive bar. Dartboard, pool table, scuffed wooden floors, Miller Lite sign, etc. The patrons are all FACING THE GIANT TELEVISION. The New Year's Ball is DROPPING. Among the patrons is our hero Carl, his best friend PETER, Peter's girlfriend LUCY, their party friend ROONEY and his ex- girlfriend, Kath who's still a little red-eyed. 
PATRONS Three, two, one... happy New Year! 
Everyone BLOWS NOISEMAKERS and POPS CHAMPAGNE. 
PATRONS (cont'd) (SINGING) Should auld acquaintance be forgot and never brought to mind? Should auld acquaintance be forgot and days of auld lang syne? 
CARL Well, that was fantastic.   Good night, guys. 
PETER You're going, already? 
KATH We haven't even finished the song yet. 
CARL I saw the ball drop and hugged all of you. Aliens didn't invade. Our computers are still working. What else could possibly happen? 
LUCY Rooney might throw up. 
ROONEY It's true.     I'm very close. 
CARL I see that happen like every night. Good night and Happy New Year. 
Carl leaves.   His friends look concerned. 
LUCY How did he take the break-up? 
KATH (CRYING) Like a robot. Two years, and nothing. 
LUCY I'm so sorry. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Carl goes into his apartment. He lies down in his bed and closes his eyes. CLOSE ON THE ALARM. His alarm goes off. Carl HITS IT off. It's now DAYTIME. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Carl gets dressed.   He puts on a nametag for Southwest Bank. 
EXT. CARL'S APARTMENT 
Carl walks down the street, fast. He passes a CUTE GIRL who's name we'll learn is RENEE passing out flyers for a band called "The Flying Buttresses." 
RENEE Wanna rock out tonight? 
CARL I don't rock out. 
Carl microwaves a Lean Cuisine. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT 
Carl watches Survivor while eating Lean Cuisine. 
INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM 
Carl lays down and closes his eyes. The alarm GOES OFF again. PULL BACK to reveal it's morning. 
INT. DUNKIN DONUTS 
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts. 
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like an Italian -- 
CARL No thanks. 
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER How about -- 
CARL No. 
EXT. STREET 
Carl ignores the girl handing out fliers. 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK 
NORMAN Valentine party. Just wear something red! 
CARL Can't. 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK

INT. CARL'S KITCHEN 
Carl warms up a frozen pizza. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT 
Carl eats the frozen pizza and watches Big Brother. 
INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM

QUICK CUTS:

NORMAN Dress as your favorite animal -- 
CARL Sorry.

Carl eats frozen lasagna while watching The Amazing Race. 
THE IMAGES START TO MOVE FASTER:

-- CARL'S HEAD HITTING THE BED. 
-- THE ALARM GOING OFF. 
PETER Our engagement party. 
CARL I'm sorry.     I'm just really busy. 
PETER You're watching Hell's Kitchen. That's not even B-list reality TV. 
CARL So I don't want to go out tonight. Maybe I have to wake up early tomorrow. You don't know. 
PETER It's bigger than that. You and Kath broke up over a year ago and you still aren't dating anyone. 
CARL What? So? I'm like a sexual camel. I only need it once every couple years. 
PETER I don't mean to be harsh but everyone's moving forward. It's like you're still wearing a Timex while the rest of us each have entry level Rolexes. 
CARL You wear a Rolex? 
PETER Thanks for noticing. It's an Oyster Perpetual Yachtmaster. Sapphire crystal, self-winding. Four Gs. But that's not the point I'm trying to make. 
CARL So I don't have an oyster watch. All you and Lucy and Kath do is sit around and talk about real estate and Crate and Barrel. 
PETER What's wrong with Crate and Barrel? They have adorable stuff at reasonable prices. 
CARL Forget Crate and Barrel. Maybe I'm just getting more mature. I don't need the lifestyle ever night. 
PETER Lifestyle? You have to have a life to have a style of life. You never leave your apartment. You never meet anyone new. 
CARL I hate meeting people. 
PETER You've become a complete cave dweller. 
CARL I am not a cave dweller. Just the other day, we all went to Summerfest and snuck backstage and you bet me I wouldn't steal something and so I stole a drumstick from that horrible Swedish hillbilly band. That's not very cave dweller of me. 
PETER Just the other day?   That was seven years ago. 
CARL But that's not possible -- I was already working at the bank by then. 
PETER You had started there three years earlier. Why you've worked at that place for so long is beyond me. You had so much potential. You shouldn't be a teller. You should be the guy who tells the guy who tells the teller what to do. 
CARL (SHOCKED) I've been a teller at Southwest Bank for ten years? How the hell did that happen? (doing the math) Ten years... if I had had a child, he'd be toilet-trained by now. 
PETER Actually, he'd be in fourth grade. 
CARL (starting to panic) I was making out with chicks by fourth grade. I was a little man by fourth grade. (THEN) Whatever. I don't need this shit right now. I'm an adult man. I can live my life as I see fit. Can you please leave? 
Carl pushes Peter out the door. Carl sits down on the couch. He then unballs the "Just Say Yes" pamphlet. It features an Indian man smiling beatifically. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT. HOLIDAY INN CONFERENCE ROOM 
A banner across a stage that has a photo of the same Indian man smiling beatifically. We PAN DOWN to find Carl among the crowd. Carl sits down next to a WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN. 
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Is this your first time at one of Sanji's lectures? 
CARL (SCOFFING) Uh, yeah. (THEN) Have you been to this before? 
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Only like fifty-eight times. Sanji's a genius. Like seriously... he will blow your mind all over the goddamn room. He's like a mind grenade. 
CARL I don't know if I want that. 
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN Oh you do not. But you need it. And that's why you are here. 
CARL Cool. Do you want anything from the refreshment area? 
WIRY, CRUNCHY WOMAN You kidding? That processed shit will kill you faster than a pleasure cruise to Chernobyl. 
Carl heads over to the refreshment table. Once he's out of her sight, he sits down alone in a corner of the conference room. Ethereal music begins to play over the loudspeakers. People begin to sit. Carl sits down in the back. 
SANJI (V.O.) Life.   We are all living it. 
Carl laughs.   No one else does.   The lights get rosier. 
SANJI (V.O.) (cont'd) Or are we? Change doesn't start on the surface. It's generated from consciousness. But where is consciousness generated from? 
Carl looks around.   Everyone is nodding along with it. 
SANJI (cont'd) From the external. And the external is manipulated through our choices. And our choices start with one word. 
The music ABRUPTLY SWITCHES to the opening beats of "Jump" by the Pointer Sisters. The rosy colored lights FLIP TO BRIGHT WHITE and SWEEP ACROSS THE CONVENTION CENTER ROOM. It is suddenly like a rock concert. SANJI (50s) BUSTS THROUGH THE GIANT BANNER. The whole crowd starts CHEERING. 
SANJI (cont'd) Yes! 
Instead of "Jump", Sanji's yelling "Yes!" 
SANJI (cont'd) Say yes! For your life! Yes! Change starts now! Yes! Yes! Yes! Say it with me! SAY YES! 
Sanji pumps his fist in the air as lame indoor fireworks GO OFF. The crowd JUMPS ON THEIR FEET. 
SANJI (cont'd) Are you ready to open the door to yes? 
CROWD Yes! 
SANJI I am sorry, my friends.      But I cannot hear you? 
CARL Oh, thanks for the invite, but... 
FLASH OF SANJI LOOMING LARGE IN CARL'S EYES. 
SANJI Will you do it for me Carl?       Just for a day? 
BACK TO CARL AND PETER.       We CLOSE IN ON CARL'S MOUTH. 
CARL (in slo-mo) Yes. 
PETER Excuse me? 
CARL (clearly not wanting to) Yes. I will come to brunch. 
EXT. STACKERS - MORNING 
Stackers is a cutesie brunch place.      Carl walks up to Peter, Lucy and Kath. 
KATH (AWKWARD) Morning, Carl. This is a surprise. 
CARL Why? 
KATH Because I've never seen you at brunch. Like ever. 
CARL You kidding? I love brunch. 
INT. STACKERS - LATER 
Carl, Peter, Lucy and Kath are still waiting with a big crowd of people to sit down for brunch. 
CARL Why do people wait an hour for breakfast? It's so hot and bright and we haven't even had coffee yet. 
PETER If you don't want to be here, you don't have to be. 
CARL Of course I want to be here. I love waiting an hour for eggs. It's fun. Although I will point out that you have sunglasses which is probably making this wait a lot easier. 
PETER Oakleys, polarized lenses, indestructible. Two fifty but worth every penny. 
The Waitress comes up. 
WAITRESS Lowell, party of five. 
A group of four people get up to be seated. 
CARL We were definitely before those Lowell people. 
KATH I hate when people jump ahead. 
CARL Why does no one ever say anything? 
PETER If you want to be sitting so bad, why don't you say something? 
CARL Yes.   I will. 
Carl walks up to the Waitress. 
CARL (cont'd) Excuse me, but we were here before those people. 
WAITRESS No you weren't. 
CARL Yes, we were. 
WAITRESS I have the list, dude.   The list doesn't lie. 
Meanwhile, the customers the Waitress was going to seat are looking away, trying not to get involved. 
CARL Well, this time the list lied. 
LUCY It's OK, Carl. It's just brunch. 
CARL (to the people who are being seated) You all know that we were up before you! And you have to live with that knowledge through your delightful brunch! 
Peter pulls Carl away from the Waitress. 
PETER What's going on with you? 
CARL I just want transparency in terms of the brunch seating order. 
One of the customers who was being seated heads over. 
KATH Great. Now we're going to get into a fight. 
BRUNCH DUDE We talked about what you said... you're right. You guys were here before us. Sorry we didn't pipe up sooner. We cool, brother? 
CARL (SURPRISED) Yeah. We cool. 
Carl and the Brunch Dude punch fists and hug. 
INT. STACKERS - LATER 
Carl and his friends are sitting at a table.    Carl's slightly bored as his friends discuss real estate. 
LUCY It's a two bedroom duplex with harbor views. It'd be perfect for you Kath. 
She keeps grinding.    A pile of pepper's growing on his food. 
INT. STACKERS - LATER 
All of Carl's food is covered piles of pepper. 
PETER I don't think I've ever seen a waiter tap one of those pepper mills. 
CARL I'm just addicted to the stuff. Chinese cultures say it's good for digestion. (THEN) You're all welcome to have some. 
LUCY That's... OK. Do you want a bite of mine? 
CARL (BEGRUDGINGLY) Yes. 
Carl takes a bite of Lucy's.      He then sips his coffee. 
CARL (cont'd) Uch. Brunch coffee. Why can't they make it black without all this frothy shit? 
PETER Because you ordered a latte. 
Carl's phone rings.   He answers it. 
NORMAN (O.S.) Hey, Carl. We're a little short on our Saturday staff. I know this is going against ten years of precedent, but you have any interest in coming in today? 
CARL I don't think... there's any reason why I shouldn't? On a Saturday there's nothing I like more than the inside of a bank. 
NORMAN (O.S.) There really is something magical about this place. 
INT. DUNKIN DONUTS 
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts. 
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like an Italian-inspired coffee flavoring? 
Beat. 
CARL Yes. 
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Sugar, Splenda or Nutrasweet? 
CARL All of them please. 
The confused Dunkin Donuts cashier loads up Carl's coffee. 
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER We're having a special on Munchkins? 
EXT. STREET 
Carl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a giant coffee and several boxes of Munchkins. He walks by Renee, the cute girl who hands out band fliers. 
RENEE Want a flier? Oh, it's you.    Never mind. 
CARL Of course I'll take a flier. 
Carl takes a flier.   Renee's surprised Carl's taking a flier. 
CARL (cont'd) (READING) The Flying Buttresses. 
RENEE I knew after a year and a half of wearing you down, you'd give in. I'm Renee by the way. 
Renee holds out her hand. 
CARL Carl. 
RENEE Carl. Cool. I like to thank everyone personally who comes to our performances. It gives it a nice intimate touch. See you soon Carl. 
Carl turns away, nervous that he's accepted her invitation. He takes a sip of his giant coffee and grimaces. 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK 
Carl STUMBLES INTO work, hyper from the giant coffee. 
NORMAN Morning, Carl. Thanks for coming in and being part of the Saturday banking experience. Oooh, Munchkins. Are those for the office, you dirty devil? 
CARL Yeah. I just though it would be a fun way to lighten things up. 
NORMAN (deadly serious) You didn't approve this with petty cash. 
CARL I spent my own money on them... 
NORMAN Kidding! Munchkins are always approved. Although, I can't reimburse you. (over the intercom) Today is free Munchkin day. That's right! Free Munchkin day! 
Instantly Carl's cubicle is surrounded by fellow workers. 
BANK EMPLOYEES Carl rules./You're the best./Finally I have a reason to live today. 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK LOUNGE 
Carl's greeting.   A MIDDLE-AGED MOTHERLY CUSTOMER comes in. 
CARL How may I help you? 
BANK CUSTOMER I need to speak to a loan specialist. 
INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE 
Carl nervously sits before Norman. 
NORMAN Earlier today, you showed some initiative. And I loved it. What do you say to a permanent spot at the loan desk? 
CARL That seems like a lot of responsibility. 
NORMAN We need a loan specialist a lot more than we need a teller and greeter. Besides, you'd have a starting salary of 52. 
CARL Grand? 
NORMAN No, dollars. What is this Darfur? (waving to an African- American employee) Sorry, Patricia, that was inappropriate. (then, back to Carl) Of course grand. To celebrate, next Saturday, I'm throwing a party. Dress up as your favorite character from Heroes. (WHISPERING) Save the cheerleader, save the world. 
CARL Next Saturday... sounds great. 
NORMAN Don't dress as Hiro.    I got dibs. 
CARL Wouldn't think of it. 
Carl heads back to the loan desk, happy about his promotion. 
INT. RUDY'S 
Carl walks in the door. Peter, Lucy and Rooney, who's clearly been there for a little while, comes up to him. 
ROONEY Carl Kendall? Out in the world? Are you some kind of ghost? Am I having a religious vision? 
CARL Believe it. Because this guy just got a promotion. 
LUCY Congrats, Carl! 
ROONEY Well let's get you a beer. You want a 20 ouncer? I'm just joking - 
CARL Yes. 
Rooney looks at Peter and Lucy. 
PETER A normal-sized beer is fine with me. 
LUCY I think I'm done actually. 
ROONEY Two twenty ouncers and one tiny, little beer, barkeep. 
BARTENDER Please don't call me that.   We're not in the middle ages. 
ROONEY (to Carl) I can't believe you're out here. I'm giddy. I feel like a child whose best friend has strict Chinese parents who never let him come out and play but now his Chinese parents are away for the Chinese New Year. You have any interest in pounding this shit? 
CARL Why not? 
Rooney picks up his beer and begins pounding the twenty ouncer. Carl reluctantly pounds it as well. Rooney slams his on the table. Carl puts it on the table. 
ROONEY What do you say we have another? 
CARL Yes. 
ROONEY You are a beast! 
LUCY Well, it's been fun watching you guys recreate freshman year, but Peter and I have some furniture errands to run. 
Carl's a little drunk now. 
CARL Have a good day yuppifying your lives. 
PETER We need a sofa, Carl.     We're not buying a second home. 
ROONEY Whatever, yuppy sellouts. 
LUCY It was good seeing you.    You should come out more often. 
CARL (kind of pleading) Please don't leave me here with him. 
Peter and Lucy laugh, not realizing that Carl is serious. They leave. 
INT. RUDY'S - NIGHT 
Carl and Rooney are really drunk. 
CARL I have not been this drunk in years! The room is spinning in a bad way! 
ROONEY Barkeep! Two more double pints s'il vous plait! 
BARTENDER That was the last `barkeep.'   I am cutting you off. 
ROONEY Well fortunately you're not the only game in town! Let's go to some place with class. 
INT. SENOR FROG'S - NIGHT 
Rooney and Carl are in a Senor Frogs. 
CARL Where's the class? 
ROONEY They wear uniforms here. 
CARL You do not cross Carl Kendall. 
The Hot Girl STUMBLES out of Senor Frog's. 
HOT GIRL Hey. I'm sorry about Domingo. He likes to think he's my boyfriend but he's not. You're cute. 
The Hot Girl KISSES Carl. 
HOT GIRL (cont'd) (CONT'D) Want to go some place private? 
CARL Yes. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Light is streaming in through the window. Carl opens his eyes. He's in bad shape. He looks over to see the Hot Girl finishing getting dressed. 
HOT GIRL My fiance called. He was like really sorry about last night.      I have to go. 
CARL Your fiance? 
HOT GIRL Domingo. The guy who punched you in the face. 
CARL I thought you said you two weren't even dating? 
HOT GIRL We were broken up last night.      It was fun hanging out. 
The Hot Girl kisses Carl on the forehead. 
HOT GIRL (cont'd) I made some coffee. It's in the kitchen. Sorry for leading you on. 
The Hot Girl LEAVES.    Carl smiles.    That was awesome. 
INT. HOLIDAY INN CONFERENCE ROOM 
Carl runs to the conference room.      The Just Say Yes seminar has been packed up. 
INT. HOLIDAY INN LOBBY 
Carl walks up to the counter. 
CARL Hi... is there a Sanji Gupta staying here? 
RECEPTIONIST Room 125. 
INT. HOLIDAY INN HALLWAY 
Carl walks down the hallway. He knocks on Room 125. After a couple minutes of shuffling around, Sanji opens the door. 
CARL I'm Carl.    The guy from yesterday. 
SANJI Of course, of course!      Please come in! 
Carl comes into Sanji's hotel room. 
SANJI (cont'd) Would you like a cup of coffee? 
CARL No thanks. I just wanted to thank you for that inspiration. 
SANJI Fantastic. So how do you plan on continuing with your journey? 
CARL You know, just living every day to it's fullest. And, like, learning to continue to experience life or whatever. 
SANJI Outstanding, Carl. Except for one THING: (suddenly intense) You are completely bullshitting me! 
CARL I just said I'm going to keep experiencing life. I thought you'd be happy. 
SANJI You're like a cigarette addict, Carl. Except you're addicted to boredom. On the way in here, Carl, I offered you a coffee and you refused. Perhaps that would have been the most delicious cup of coffee you would have ever had. Who's to say? Not you, Carl, because you said no! Anyone can quit smoking for a day. But for a lifetime? No. 
CARL So what should I do? 
Sanji PULLS OUT a contract. 
SANJI Behold, Carl, -- the Maniyesto. 
Carl takes the Maniyesto. 
CARL (reading the document) 1) Until New Year's Eve, I must say yes. 2) The yes cannot distort the truth. 
SANJI (EXPLAINING) You cannot say "Yes, the world is flat" because that is an untruth. 
CARL (reading the document) 3) If someone discovers you are a yes man, you do not have to say yes to them. 4) To avoid yes, you cannot avoid contact. Therefore, you must always answer your phone, the door, your postal mail, your email, etc and so on and so forth. 5) You must choose a yesponsor to keep you on the straight and narrow. (to Sanji) Who should that be? 
SANJI A close friend who will not tell a soul. 
CARL (reading the document) 5) I hereby void the "do you want" loophole. (to Sanji) What is that? 
SANJI If someone asks you "do you want to go to the art museum" and you do not want to, you may not use this lack of desire as an excuse to not go. And finally, a warning. (SPOOKILY) If you say `no', even once, even for a cup of coffee, be prepared to lose every single little thing you've gained. (THEN) So what do you say, Carl? (WHISPERING) What do you say? 
CARL I say... yes. 
Carl signs the Maniyesto. 
SANJI And here. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Carl wakes up.   He looks at the tattooed "Yes" on his hand. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT 
Carl goes through a series of junk mail flyers for credit cards. He VERY CAREFULLY fills each one of them out. 
INT. DUNKIN DONUTS 
Carl walks into Dunkin Donuts.    Before the cashier can say anything... 
CARL Black coffee, large. 
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER Would you like... 
CARL (cutting her off) To have a wonderful day?    I would. 
Carl turns to see a giant poster with the words "DO YOU WANT A MOCHA CARAMEL COOLATA?" Carl turns back to the cashier. 
CARL (cont'd) (RESIGNED) And could I also have a Mocha Caramel Coolata. 
DUNKIN DONUTS CASHIER With whipped cream? 
EXT. STREET 
Carl walks out of Dunkin Donuts, carrying a frozen coffee drink and several boxes of Munchkins. He walks by Renee and wordlessly takes a flier. 
RENEE Hey, give that back.    You already took one. 
CARL What's the hurt in taking another? 
RENEE Destroys the Earth. Also, they cost me ten cents a copy. Besides, are you even going to come? 
CARL Of course.     I couldn't say `no.' 
As he walks away... 
CARL (cont'd) Even if I wanted to. 
RENEE See you tonight, Carl! 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK 
Carl sits at his cubicle, and flips on his email. In the background, we see various SUPER HAPPY EMPLOYEES eating the Dunkin Donuts that Carl has brought. We see on the screen another email from the King of Nigeria. 
CARL Dear deposed King of Nigeria. I would love to help you anyway I can with your confidential transaction. Please let me know what I can do. Yours, Carl Kendall. 
He checks the next email. 
CARL (cont'd) Would I like Viagra? Yes, I would. 
Carl writes back to the Viagra. ANGLE ON THE SCREEN: The next email is from PERSIANWIFEFINDER.COM. 
CARL (cont'd) (CONT'D) Do I want a Persian wife? Perhaps I do. 
Carl clicks onto the Persianwifefinder.com and starts uploading his profile. Norman walks by. 
CARL (cont'd) Norman, would you say I prefer Iranian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi or no preference? 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK 
Carl's reading his email when a HIGH SCHOOL GIRL sits down. 
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL You Carl Kendall? 
CARL Yeah. 
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL I hear that you do small loans. 
CARL Where did you hear that? 
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL Marge. The lady my mom buys her beanie babies from. 
CARL I told her not to say anything. 
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL I only need five hundred bucks. I'm starting college next year and I need it for books. I can't afford them now but I can pay them off over the course of the year. 
Carl looks to make sure Norman's not around then he stamps her form. 
HIGH SCHOOL GIRL (cont'd) Thank you so much, Mr. Kendall. 
EXT. STREET 
Carl walks down the street, taking fliers from anyone who passes them out. We do QUICK CUTS of him with various people as he walks down the street. 
CARL I might have some stuff to pawn./I will definitely check out your gun selection./I would like to learn Korean. 
BERLITZ FLIER GUY If you're interested, intro to Korean is starting right now. 
INT. BERLITZ CLASS - DAY 
Carl's sitting in a Korean class with several businessmen. 
CARL How about a calendar shower? 
LUCY Can we concentrate at the task at hand? 
CARL Do you even know what a calendar shower is? Maybe a calendar shower is awesome. 
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS Every guest gets assigned a month and brings a gift that the bride and groom can use during that month. 
LUCY That's kind of cute. 
CARL I think that's really cute. 
Carl's starting to get really into it. He turns the page and sees an invitation decorated with animals labeled "Knights in White Armor." 
CARL (cont'd) Look at this one -- "Knights in White Armor." 
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS The bride and groom ride in on a white stallion. 
CARL You have got to do that.   Like it's not even a choice. 
LUCY That seems a little extreme. 
CARL You only get married once. 
STATIONERY PROPRIETESS Your friend happens to be right. 
LUCY You're really good at this. You mind helping me with the wedding invitations? 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK 
Carl's sitting across from an Arab Guy at the loan desk. 
ARAB GUY I love cell phones. I breathe cell phones. I own, myself, thirty-five cell phones. My brother is an idiot and he's selling cell phones hand over fist. What do you have? A Nokia 9850? 
The Arab Guy goes to grab Carl's phone.   He sees the photo of Renee on the phone's wallpaper. 
ARAB GUY (cont'd) Oooh, pretty lady. 
Carl grabs his phone back. 
CARL How much do you need? 
ARAB GUY Eighty five hundred. 
CARL Done. 
Carl stamps his form. 
CUT TO A TEN YEAR OLD GIRL SITTING WITH HER SILENT MOM: 
TEN YEAR OLD GIRL I was with my sister? And we had this lemonade stand? And we sold like a hundred cups of lemonade in two days? And so I want to expand? (MORE) 
TEN YEAR OLD GIRL (cont'd) All I need is three thousand dollars? 
Carl stamps her form. 
CUT TO A JITTERY GUY. 
JITTERY GUY Just give me the cash. 
CARL You promise you'll pay it back? 
JITTERY GUY Basically. 
Carl stamps his form.    Norman comes over. 
NORMAN May I speak to you, Carl? 
INT. NORMAN'S OFFICE 
Norman sits across from Carl. 
NORMAN I know what you're doing. 
CARL What am I doing? 
NORMAN You're loaning below our minimum. 
Carl doesn't know what to say. 
NORMAN (cont'd) You thought I wouldn't notice the paperwork? I'm not the regional manager because I ignore the details. 
CARL I'm sorry, but it's absurd that if you need a small amount of money you have to go to a loan shark. Only rich people can pay back loans over ten grand. A bank's job is not to just help the rich. It's to help anyone with a dream achieve it. 
NORMAN I know. These microloans are pretty interesting. So I'll you spearhead a little pilot program at the bank. 
CARL Thank you so much. 
NORMAN If corporate finds out, you're the one who's getting fired. So keep it quiet. 
Carl mimes zipping up his mouth and throwing away the key. 
QUICK CUTS OF CARL STAMPING LOTS OF FORMS 
CARL It's lame, but you know, it's pretty funny. My boss Norman always throws theme parties. 
RENEE So if it's lame why do you work there? 
CARL Because... it's actually not lame. (REALIZING) I just gave the answer I've automatically given for years. I'm actually enjoying the bank for the first time maybe ever. I started this pilot program that gives out microloans. 
RENEE What's that? 
CARL Like say you need three hundred bucks to pay for paint so you can start a house painting business. Rather than paying a loan shark who charges you 300%, now you can come to Southwest Bank. Whatever. It's kind of dorky. 
RENEE That actually sounds really cool. 
The waitress comes over. 
RENEE (cont'd) I'm stuffed. But I would love to wrap this up. 
CARL (in Korean, with SUBTITLES) [We are very fat. But can I please have this food made mobile?] 
RENEE So, what do you say we hit this crazy party? 
CARL Funny, not crazy.    My boss is white noise. 
RENEE White noise? 
CARL You know, like totally boring. 
RENEE I don't know anyone who's totally boring. Crack a person's shell -- there's always something creepy underneath. 
INT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Norman opens the door. He's dressed as the Japanese character Hiro from the show Heroes. 
NORMAN Carl! Welcome. Or should I say, uerukamu! 
RENEE What's going on? 
CARL I wouldn't bother. 
NORMAN You didn't tell her? This is a dress-up as your favorite character from Heroes. Do you watch? 
RENEE I currently don't have a television. 
Norman stares at her. 
NORMAN I don't know what to do with that information. There are drinks, chips, dips, various and sundry noshes. I entreat you to make friends. Let's get this party started! 
INT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT 
It's very quiet.    A couple people mill about. 
CARL We don't have to stay long. 
RENEE It's a party. Let's socialize. 
Carl and Renee walk up to a MOUSEY GIRL. 
CARL I'm Carl.     This is Renee. 
KHATOON Hey.     I'm Khatoon. 
It's complete silence.    Beat. 
KHATOON (cont'd) Do I know you from somewhere? 
CARL I don't think so. 
KHATOON Are you listed on Persianwifefinder.com? 
Renee laughs.    Carl fake laughs with her. 
KHATOON (cont'd) Seriously, though, are you? 
CARL So, how do you know Norman? 
KHATOON Karate Club. 
Norman comes in with more chips.   There are now about ten times as many snacks as guests. 
NORMAN Baked Lays people!   It is on! 
CARL You're in a karate club? 
INT. NORMAN'S APARTMENT 
Everyone's standing around Norman. They've laid several pieces of wood out over a coffee table. 
PARTY GUESTS Norman!    Norman! Norman! 
Norman KARATE CHOPS the wood in half.   The guests cheer. Norman takes a big bow. 
RENEE (whispering to Carl) Told ya there was something weird under that white noise shell. 
Renee leaves Carl. 
The room is piled floor to ceiling with boxes.   Renee starts to go through the boxes. 
CARL You don't need to do that. 
RENEE You have a lot of Mexican Viagra. 
CARL I have a congenital heart thing it helps. And it's cheaper than the stuff that's made here. 
RENEE You better not be a criminal. Because one time I dated this guy who jacked cars for a living and I did not enjoy living on the edge as much as I thought I would. 
CARL It's cheaper to buy in bulk.    Is that a crime? 
RENEE A hundred boxes of Mexican prescription drugs borders on something vaguely criminal. 
Beat. 
RENEE (cont'd) Well, are you going to make out with me or what? 
CARL Yes. 
Carl grabs Renee and starts making out with her.   They fall onto the bed. REVEAL Rooney watching them. 
ROONEY You must be Renee. I have heard so much about you. Can I watch? 
Carl doesn't know what to say.   Before he has to say yes... 
RENEE No, you can't watch. 
INT. CARL'S BEDROOM - LATER 
Renee and Carl lie next to each other. 
RENEE You know what I would love?    A massage. 
CARL I give great massages. 
Carl starts massaging her. 
RENEE Oooh.   Yeah. Oooh, right there. 
Carl stops. 
RENEE (cont'd) Don't stop. 
Carl continues massaging her. 
CHYRON: HALF HOUR LATER 
Carl's still massaging her.    He stops. 
RENEE (cont'd) Can you please keep massaging? 
Carl starts massaging again. 
CHYRON: AN HOUR LATER 
Carl's massaging. His hands are really cramping up.   She's asleep. He stops massaging. 
RENEE (cont'd) (while asleep) Please keep massaging, please? 
Carl starts massaging again, wincing while he does it. 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - LOAN DESK 
Carl's sitting across from a LARGE MAN. Carl's hands are like claws. A line of people waits to speak with him. 
CARL How much does a Schwinn cost? 
LARGE MAN Three hundred fifty three dollars. It'll really help me get my one hour delivery business off the ground. I've tried on foot. I only have a two mile radius. 
CARL Done and done. 
Carl stamps the package.      Norman comes over to the loan desk. 
NORMAN Hey, the boys upstairs are here to speak with you. 
CARL Really?   Because I have a thing at one... 
NORMAN He asked for you specifically. Ixnay on the small loans-ay. 
Carl looks over. He sees the President (from the beginning of the movie) sitting in the conference room. Carl gets nervous. 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM 
Carl walks into the conference room.     The bank president, CHRIS PARKER, motions to a seat. 
CHRIS PARKER Carl Kendall? I'm Chris Parker. President of Southwest Bank. 
CARL I actually met you when I was just a teller. 
CHRIS PARKER (no recollection of it at ALL) Of course! (reading from a binder) Pet-a-Puppy day. Free cookie day. Free half hour on the bank's punching bag day. You've upped walk-in traffic by 35%. Not only that -- you've also taken charge of corporate day care. I like a team player. 
Carl's phone buzzes.    The caller ID says LUCY. 
CARL She's terrified too. 
PETER Really? 
CARL Of course she is. I think you'll both be a lot less terrified if you're terrified together. 
PETER But what if I really can't tell the difference between ivory and cream? Does that make me a bad husband? 
CARL What matters is that you pretend you can see the difference. 
The girls and Seb come out from the restaurant with their coats on. There's a silent beat. 
GIRLS (high pitched goodbyes) It was wonderful meeting you!/I loved it!/Let me know when you throw your next art thing! 
Everyone gets into their cars.   Carl and Renee walk off. 
RENEE It was great meeting your friends. 
CARL They're a little stiff. 
Beat. 
RENEE They are a little stiff.   What do you feel like doing? 
CARL I'm actually going rollerblading with Ralph. 
RENEE Ralph? 
CARL You know, crazy rollerblading guitar man. 
RENEE The guy who plays at the promenade? 
CARL Any interest? 
RENEE No. It's ten on a Friday night. And that guy's crazy. Don't you want to go home and make out? 
CARL Yes. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT 
Carl and Renee are making while Carl surreptitiously checks his watch. Finally, Renee stops kissing him. 
RENEE (ANNOYED) Just go. 
EXT. STREET 
Carl and CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN rollerblade down the street while guitar man plays guitar. 
CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN Which is why the merman is not to be trusted, especially with the fisherman's computer brain. 
CARL That is really good to know. 
CRAZY ROLLERBLADING GUITAR MAN You want to come see the merman? 
CARL (RELUCTANT) Yes. 
INT. COUNTRY CLUB - DAY 
Carl dashes in, covered in spots of paint.    Chris appears. 
CHRIS PARKER What happened to you? 
FLASHBACK: CHYRON: TEN MINUTES AGO 
Carl's playing really intense, terrifying paintball with Norman and Rooney. 
BACK TO NOW: 
CARL I do this whole Habitat for Humanity Thing. 
CHRIS PARKER I love the concept of charity. It's awesome. 
A group of KOREAN GENTLEMAN approach Carl and Chris. 
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) This is Carl Kendall. This is Jin Kim, Joo-Chan Park, Soo Lee and Seung Kim. Seung's the CEO of Korean Bank International. 
The Koreans shake Carl's hand. 
CARL (in Korean, with SUBTITLES) [It is an honor to meet you.   Do you like America?] 
The Koreans all start speaking Korean at Carl.   Carl clearly doesn't understand what they're saying. 
EXT. COUNTRY CLUB 
Chris and Carl follow the Koreans. 
CHRIS PARKER You speak Korean? 
CARL Just a little. 
CHRIS PARKER You sneaky devil. I knew I should watch my back around you. 
CARL Is it a problem if I've never played golf before? 
Beat.   She laughs.   He laughs along with her. 
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER (in Korean) [I have a business proposition for you. My marriage is not a happy one. I often find my needs are left unsatisfied.] 
CARL (in Korean) [I agree. The weather is sunny.] 
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER (in Korean) [I wish that was so.] (in English) Kiss me? Please? 
Carl doesn't know what to do. 
CARL (NERVOUSLY) Yes. 
She kisses him passionately.    Carl breaks away from the kiss. 
PRETTY KOREAN BANKER Am I not sexy? Have you not heard of saving face? 
CARL You're very sexy. 
Carl and the Korean Banker kiss more.   Carl looks guilty. 
EXT. COUNTRY CLUB 
Carl's shaking hands with the Korean Bank Representatives. Chris shakes Carl's hand. 
CHRIS PARKER I'm promoting you to bank manager. (pulling Carl close) I've got my eye on you, boy. Don't you forget it. 
Chris laughs. Carl nervously laughs along with him. The Pretty Korean Banker walks by and waves at him. Carl waves back. He looks very guilty. 
INT. POTTERY STUDIO 
Carl walks into the pottery studio, looking guilty.   Renee is making a giant piece of pottery. 
RENEE What's up, chicken butt? (off his guilty look) (MORE) 
RENEE (cont'd) Are you OK? Did everything go OK at golf? 
Carl considers whether he should say anything about the kiss. 
CARL I just got promoted to bank manager. 
RENEE Congratulations! 
Renee kisses Carl. 
RENEE (cont'd) Oooh, we should do some sexy pottery. Like you can rub the clay all over me. 
CARL OK. 
Carl goes to grab some clay. 
RENEE I was kidding. Not as sexy as it seems. It gets in like everywhere. (awkward beat) What should we do to celebrate? 
CARL Have dinner? 
RENEE How about Korean? Oh, no, you probably already had some today. 
CARL (NERVOUSLY) No, we just had American food, American fare. 
RENEE You've just been so busy -- it'd be fun to have a night just the two of us. I wish we could just go to the airport and hop on the first flight outta here. 
Carl's eyes light up. 
CARL Yes. 
INT. AIRPORT - TICKET COUNTER 
Renee and Carl are in line at the ticketing counter. 
RENEE (with an English accent) I think we're going to London. 
CARL (with a Spanish accent) Oaxaca, senorita. 
RENEE (with a Russian accent) Moscow, Russia, comrade. 
CARL (with an unidentifiable ACCENT) Singapore. 
RENEE What was that? 
CARL My Singaporean accent.     Pretty good, right? 
They get to the front of the line. 
CARL (cont'd) (PROUDLY) We want two tickets on the next plane out of here. 
AIRLINE REP Two tickets to... Lincoln, Nebraska.   Have a good time. 
Carl and Renee take the tickets. 
CARL (acting positive) Lincoln, Nebraska! Here we come, baby! 
AIRLINE REP That'll be twelve hundred and thirty three dollars. 
RENEE Maybe we shouldn't do this. 
ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE (in character) I'll connect you to the coast in an instant with Alexander Graham Bell's brand new invention -- the telephone! Just a haypenny per ten minutes. (out of character) (MORE) 
ELDERLY TOUR GUIDE (cont'd) This place is boring as shit. Check out the Lester F. Larsen Tractor Test & Power Museum. Now that's an attraction. Ask for Billy. 
She hands Carl a brochure. 
EXT. LESTER F. LARSEN TRACTOR TEST AND POWER MUSEUM 
Carl and Renee stand outside. 
RENEE We don't have to do this. 
CARL We're here. We might as well. 
EXT. FIELD - MOMENTS LATER 
Carl and Renee RIDE A TRACTOR.   Renee's taking photos as they BUMP OVER THE FIELD. 
CARL THIS IS AWESOME! 
TRACTOR DRIVER WANT ME TO OPEN THIS SUCKER UP? 
CARL/RENEE YES! 
The driver TURNS UP THE SPEED.   They're suddenly going crazy fast. 
TRACTOR DRIVER TAKE THE WHEEL! FEEL THE POWER OF JOHN DEERE! 
Carl takes the wheel. The tractor IMMEDIATELY GETS AWAY FROM HIM. They SWERVE STRAIGHT and CRASH THROUGH THE WALL OF AN OLD BARN. The DRIVER kills the engine. Renee, Carl and the Driver catch their breath. 
CARL There's, uhh, no power steering. 
TRACTOR DRIVER It's a tractor, not a Toyota. 
CARL I'm sorry about the barn. 
TRACTOR DRIVER Been meaning to tear this sucker down anyway. 
EXT. ANTELOPE PARK AND SUNKEN GARDENS 
Carl and Renee walk around a surprisingly pretty city park. 
RENEE I think I might have whiplash from that tractor ride. 
CARL Just don't sue me. 
RENEE Watch your back, Carl.   I mean it. I'm very litigious. 
CARL This day has been so randomly incredible. 
RENEE Would you... want to... travel around the world with me? (THEN) I mean, I know we haven't really been seeing each other for that long, but I don't know... 
CARL Yes. 
RENEE Yes? 
CARL Definitely. 
RENEE I think I'm falling, you know... Are you... ? 
CARL Yes. 
They kiss. 
RENEE Before our flight, what do you say we grab a couple Nebraskan steaks? 
CARL I'm definitely falling for you. 
INT. LINCOLN AIRPORT 
Carl's sitting in the lounge at the Lincoln Airport.    An OLD WOMAN comes up to him. 
OLD WOMAN Excuse me. Would you mind bringing this to my son? 
The Old Woman hands Carl an UNMARKED, SHADY-LOOKING PACKAGE. 
CARL Like you want me to bring it with me? On the plane? 
OLD WOMAN Fedex is so expensive and this needs to get to him today. 
CARL (very nervous) Yeah. Sure. I'd be happy to. 
OLD WOMAN He's a tall, blond fellow named Sheldon Winkleton. He'll be holding a sign in the terminal with his name on it. You are a dear. 
The Old Woman shuffles off.    Carl looks at the box.   Renee returns. 
RENEE I got US Weekly, Star and, for a little culture, the National Enquirer. 
CARL National Enquirer? 
RENEE They have movie reviews.    What's in the package? 
CARL Just a gift for some buddies back home. 
CARL Look, when the nice lady asked me to take them on the plane, I thought they were chocolates. 
RENEE You expect me to believe a nice lady asked you to bring chocolates on a plane? 
CARL I know how it sounds. 
RENEE I don't think you do. 
Carl just looks at her. 
RENEE (cont'd) If you can't be honest with me, then you and the nice lady can have a fun life in Candyland. 
Renee starts off. 
CARL Wait!     I'll explain better. 
She turns back around. 
INT. COFFEE SHOP 
Carl sits across from Renee. 
RENEE So you've just been saying yes to everything. 
CARL Yes. (THEN) Pardon the pun. 
RENEE Oh. 
CARL See? Do you get it now? It's nothing, just a glitch really. 
RENEE I thought we had so much in common but if you just yes to everything I don't know that we do. How do I know if you even like Korean food? 
Beat. 
CARL I don't. 
RENEE Do you even want to travel around the world at all or do you want to work at that bank and buy a lot of Prada suits? 
CARL (CONFUSED) Yes. And yes. 
Something registers in Renee. 
RENEE When I asked if you were falling for me all you said was yes. 
She rises, shaking her head, and heads for the door. 
CARL It wasn't a lie. 
RENEE Yes.    It was. 
INT. BLOOD BANK 
Carl's strapped to a giant plasma donation machine. It's horrifying. As he donates plasma, he could not look more depressed. 
NURSE It'll be over soon. 
CARL I don't care. Just take it all. 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK CORPORATE OFFICES 
Carl stumbles into the lounge outside Chris's office. 
SECRETARY Chris will be with you in a moment. Would you like something to drink? 
INT. CHRIS PARKER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Carl walks into Chris's office carrying a cup of coffee a Diet Coke, and a bottle of water. 
CHRIS PARKER So I got a call from the police department. 
CARL I'm not a drug dealer -- 
Chris closes the door to his office. 
CHRIS PARKER I spent a couple years in prison myself. So I backdated some stock options. Excuse me for trying to help our bottom line, right? 
CARL You got to do what you got to do to help Mr. And Mrs. Shareholder. 
CHRIS PARKER We are their slaves. 
CARL Totally. 
CHRIS PARKER Honestly, I prefer for all my top guys to have been in the Big House. We've all eaten the slop. There's a trust there you can't break. 
Chris holds out his hand. 
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) So, what do you say to being a VP and expanding your microloan program bankwide? 
CARL (SURPRISED) Yes. 
Carl shakes Chris's hand. 
INT. CARL'S NEW OFFICE 
PETER You own an apartment because of that job. People don't generally leave good jobs. 
CARL But the bank doesn't feel right... 
Peter's phone rings.   Peter picks it up. 
PETER Hey, honey. I think we should go with the tulips. I know roses are more romantic, but they're also much more clichéd. Babe, can you wait a second? (covering the phone) I'm going to be on for a while. Ask your guru. He's the one who sent you on this retarded quest in the first place. 
INT. MARRIOTT CONFERENCE CENTER 
Sanji's SIGNING BOOKS.    Carl gets to the front of the line. 
CARL Hi, Sanji.     I'm Carl.   Kendall. 
SANJI (no memory of Carl) Of course! Would you like to purchase my new book, "The Power of Yes: Life is Yessy"? 
CARL Actually, I had a question for you... 
SANJI Well, this line is for book customers only. 
INT. MARRIOTT COFFEE SHOP - LATER 
Sanji's eating by himself.    Carl comes up to him. 
CARL I'm sorry to bother you again -- 
SANJI Can't you see that I'm eating? 
CARL I have a really important question. I have to choose between traveling around the world with a girl I'm really into or choosing a job that will make me pretty well off. I don't know which yes to take. 
SANJI How well off? 
CARL I don't know why that's important. 
SANJI I should know all the data. 
CARL A lot, OK? 
SANJI This is    what I recommend. Every winter,    I throw a two week long seminar    in Aspen. It's only ten grand a    week and it will open your mind up    -- 
CARL I don't want to go to a seminar. I just need help with this question. 
SANJI For you, eight grand a week. I have helped celebrities like Cher and Jack Welch. You will love it -- 
CARL (REALIZING) You're a total con artist. 
SANJI I am not a con artist. Have I not set you on the life path you desire? 
CARL (PANICKING) I've put my life into the hands of a con artist! And because of you I have this retarded yes branded on my hand for life! (yelling to the RESTAURANT) This man is a con artist! Don't listen to this man! He is a con artist! 
Carl runs out of the restaurant. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT 
Carl returns home.    Rooney's on the couch, wearing a headset playing Xbox Live. 
ROONEY (into the headset) You are dead, AnalDestroyer832! 
Carl PULLS the xBox cord out of the law. 
CARL Out! 
ROONEY What?   Why? 
CARL You've slept on my couch for four weeks. You're a grown man. Now sack up and get the hell out of here. 
ROONEY Will you let me stay here please? 
CARL Are you deaf? 
ROONEY You have to say yes if I ask you. 
CARL You knew? 
ROONEY I may not seem like I get it, but I get everything. Lucy and Kath? Made out one time in the bathroom at Rudy's. 
CARL Get the hell out of here. 
INT. CARL'S LIVING ROOM/BEDROOM 
Carl's in front of his computer. There are a bunch of emails selling Viagra. He angrily deletes them all. He gets a letter from the King of Nigeria. 
NIGERIAN KING (V.O.) Dear Carl, It is vitally important you send me your bank account information. The government will be closing in on my account in the very near future. Your good friend, Omar, Former King of Nigeria. 
Carl starts typing fast. As Carl writes the following email, we cuts of him THROWING AWAY THE BOXES OF STUFF HE BOUGHT OVER THE INTERNET and GIVING AWAY THE SIX KITTENS HE GOT TO THE ASPCA. 
CARL (V.O.) Omar, Let's cut the crap. You are not a king. You're probably just a teenage con artist jerking off somewhere in Russia. Write me again and I will find you and beat your stupid lying face in. Dick. Sincerely, Carl Kendall. 
Carl angrily flips off his computer. 
INT. CARL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON THE ALARM.   His alarm goes off.   Carl HITS IT off. It's now DAYTIME. 
INT. CARL'S NEW OFFICE 
Carl's writing a list of names. The post card lies on the desk nearby. His secretary pops her head in. 
CARL'S SECRETARY The executives are gathering in the conference room to officially greet the KBI Officials. (MORE) 
CARL'S SECRETARY (cont'd) (re: the post card) Cute gorilla. 
CARL It's an elderly orangutan actually. (handing her the list) Could you please call everyone on this list and tell them to show up at Rudy's Bar & Grille this evening at 9PM? 
CARL'S SECRETARY Will do. 
Carl starts to head out and then turns around. 
CARL I just want to say, it was really great having you as my first secretary. 
CARL'S SECRETARY You're not firing me, are you? 
CARL I don't think I'm going to be working here much longer. 
INT. SOUTHWEST BANK - CONFERENCE ROOM 
Carl walks into the crowded room.   Korean executives and Southwest Bank executives mingle.   Carl heads towards Chris. 
CARL I need to talk to you. 
CHRIS PARKER And I need to talk to you. You mind doing a little ceremonial translating? 
CARL I don't know if I'm good enough at Korean -- 
CHRIS PARKER Believe in yourself and the world believes in you. 
SEUNG sees Carl and bows to him. Carl bows back. The Pretty Korean Banker sees Carl and coquettishly waves to him. Chris TAPS the microphone. The crowd sits down. 
CHRIS PARKER (cont'd) I'd like to welcome our new partners into the Southwest family. 
Chris nods to Carl. 
CARL (in Korean, with SUBTITLES) [Welcome. You will be my partner.] 
SEUNG KIM (in Korean) [Thank you.] 
CHRIS PARKER KBI is the at the forefront of the financial world. With your help, Southwest will be as well. 
Carl takes a beat.    Chris looks at him, expectantly. 
CARL (in Korean, with SUBTITLES) [He says that you are a son of a dog and like to have the dirty sex.] 
SEUNG KIM (in Korean) [What?] 
CHRIS PARKER We look forward to working together and extending our reach across the globe. 
CARL (in Korean, with SUBTITLES) [He says in Korea you poop on the ground and that here you cannot poop on the ground.] 
SEUNG KIM (in Korean) [That is factually inaccurate] 
CARL (in Korean) [I know. But it's what the bigot believes.] 
CHRIS PARKER So with this hand shake, I make official the acquisition of Southwest by Korean Bank International. 
Chris holds out his hand. 
CARL (in Korean) [Although you have poop on your hand, I am willing to shake it so I can steal all your money, you stupid Korean.] 
SEUNG KIM No. 
CHRIS PARKER Excuse me? 
SEUNG KIM (perfect English with a British accent) We have a traitor in our midst. This man just called me a son of a dog and informed me that my hand is covered in fecal matter. He is clearly trying to sabotage the merger. 
CARL You speak English? 
SEUNG KIM You think an international bank financier wouldn't speak fluent English? For whom do you work, traitor? Shanghai Bank? Chinatrust? 
CARL For myself. 
SEUNG KIM Fine. Keep it secret. Unfortunately, I cannot approve a merger with a company so incompetent as to have a business saboteur this high up. Good day. 
Seung Kim walks out, followed by all his employees.   Before Chris can say anything... 
CARL I quit. 
Carl leaves. 
INT. RUDY'S - NIGHT 
Peter, Lucy, Rooney, Norman, Tony, Loan Recipients, several Persian Woman -- all of Carl's friends along with everyone that he's met on his Yes journey have gathered at Rudy's. 
PETER Why does he want us here? 
LUCY I have no idea. 
Kath and Seb walk in.

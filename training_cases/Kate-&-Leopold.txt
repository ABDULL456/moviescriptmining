He spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. Hiding his dance card, he saunters over. 
LEOPOLD Good evening. I do not believe I have had the pleasure. 
The young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes he is addressing her. She puts her pad away. 
CARLSON ...Julia Carlson. 
Leopold takes her hand and kisses it gently. 
CARLSON I'm sorry. Will you excuse me? 
LEOPOLD (slightly tipsy) You are not from the area, are you? 
CARLSON (smiles and shakes her head "No") Are you? 
LEOPOLD This is my estate. 
CARLSON Really? (looking around the room) Well it's not home but it's much... 
Leopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There is a hubbub amongst the guests. 
LEOPOLD Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY. 
CARLSON The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't it? 
LEOPOLD It is a scandal nonetheless. 
Leopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room. 
LEOPOLD Miss Carlson, do me the honor? 
CARLSON I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer. 
LEOPOLD (smiling seductively) Truly I would be in your debt. Any admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as yourself. 
CARLSON No, no. Really, I... 
Leopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck, takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor. 
They dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing "TA-RA-RA- BOOM-DE-AY." Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson, shy at first, eventually smiles brightly. 
LEOPOLD I suppose we really ought to sing along. 
CARLSON (embarrassed) Oh, golly. 
They half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their emphasis on "BOOM." Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally: 
CARLSON (breathless) Thank you for the dance. It was lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful for you. 
LEOPOLD Not at all. It was most enlightening. 
There is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes midnight. 
CARLSON I really must be going. 
LEOPOLD I won't hear of it. 
CARLSON (moving away from him) No, I'm quite late as it is. 
LEOPOLD I shall see you to the door... 
CARLSON (stopping him resolutely) You're very sweet. I had a wonderful time. (she watches him, memorizing his face. Then firmly) Goodbye. 
Leopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her. 
EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT 
Leopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She is once again writing in her notebook. 
LEOPOLD Miss Carlson? 
Carlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS. Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting a weird glow. 
LEOPOLD Good God... 
CARLSON What are you...? You frightened me. 
Leopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch it... 
LEOPOLD What sort of mechanism is this? 
Carlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed. 
KATE You're going to be fine you know. There's nothing to worry about. I have everything under control. 
Dr. Kau stares at Kate in concerned silence. 
KATE (quietly to Dr. Kau) We'll never get away with this. 
INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 
Leopold awakens alone in his room. He sits up with a jolt. His stomach sinks as he realizes THIS IS NO DREAM. He slowly rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe. He makes his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob. 
There is a KNOCK on the door. 
Leopold JUMPS back and runs to the bed: The picture of dignity. 
KATE How are you feeling? (no response) I thought you might like some tea. 
LEOPOLD I insist on being returned home immediately. 
KATE I understand. We're doing our best. 
LEOPOLD I wish to speak with your employer, Dr. Coles. 
KATE You're speaking to him. 
LEOPOLD You are not suggesting that you are Dr. Coles? 
She smiles. 
LEOPOLD Miss... uh? 
KATE Dr. Coles. If you like, you could call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's too much, how about just plain Kate? 
LEOPOLD (coldly) A WOMAN of science? 
KATE Hard to believe? 
LEOPOLD But a woman's brain cannot obtain enough knowledge to posses a truly scientific mind. 
KATE (jotting this down) Interesting. Nevertheless, we've come a long way baby. 
LEOPOLD (confused) Are you attempting to be humorous? 
KATE I'm attempting to be informative it's just coming out humorous. 
Leopold regards her dubiously. 
KATE (clinically) Look, modern social science clearly states that a woman's place in society marks the level of that civilization. A science career for a woman is now almost as acceptable as being a... a... waitress. Cream and sugar? 
LEOPOLD Young lady, I... Surely it is not expected that I remain here with you indefinitely... Unchaperoned? 
KATE (pen poised) Does that make you nervous? 
LEOPOLD Certainly not! 
KATE (writing) Then what are you getting so red about? It's a very large apartment... with locks on all the doors. 
LEOPOLD The idea! My dear Miss Coles... 
KATE Dr. Coles. 
LEOPOLD Honey... 
KATE (she puts the pad down) Let's get one thing straight right now. My name is Kate or Katherine or if you insist Dr. Coles. (she rises) Take a good long look, Leopold. I am a 20th century American woman with a Doctorate and a commission and independence. I am not your "young lady" or your "pretty Miss" or your "honey." Is that clear? 
Leopold watches her with great interest. Finally: 
LEOPOLD Honey... For the tea. 
KATE ...I'll get it for you. 
Kate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Kate rummages through every drawer, shelf and cupboard searching for the honey. Finally, she spots the honeybear and squeezes honey A TAD TO VIOLENTLY into the tea. She tries posing "confidently" then checks her reflection in the toaster. 
INT. BEDROOM - MORNING 
Kate returns "confidently" with the tea and a plastic smile. 
LEOPOLD Thank you... Has it been decided what it is I am to do while I am being held here? 
KATE Oh, just some laundry, the cooking, a little light housework... 
CHARLIE What about a hotel? 
KATE This man requires around the clock attention. 
CHARLIE I meant for me. 
KATE Thank you, Charlie. (she kisses his forehead) I owe you one. 
CHARLIE You owe me nine. What am I supposed to do all day? 
KATE (as if having an epiphany) You could get a job! 
CHARLIE Kate, the entire point of being an artist is that I don't have to work. Who is this guy? 
KATE Well, I can't tell you much because... 
KATE AND CHARLIE I'm not allowed to discuss what goes on at the office. 
KATE Well I'm not. Anyway, it might be interesting to have someone else to talk to. It gets so quiet around here sometimes I feel like I've gone deaf. 
CHARLIE Does he have a label? 
KATE Leopold. 
CHARLIE LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his name? 
KATE He's exactly like his name. 
CHARLIE Then you owe me ten. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Leopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room. Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright fashionable furniture. Leopold recoils. His eyes come to rest on the television set. The ON OFF buttons loom large. He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button ON. 
Instantly, REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other before an excited crowd. 
Leopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of him as if shooing away a bee. He quickly, yet cautiously, slams the power OFF. 
LEOPOLD Horrible! 
He quickly scurries out the hallway. 
He stops abruptly. He remains very still. Composing himself, he turns and deliberately faces the room. After a moment, he purposefully steps back inside. 
He makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that. He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room. 
He looks at the lights then back at the switch. He flicks the lights ON and OFF, trying to figure out the precise moment in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself. 
Kate and Charlie enter. They watch Leopold flicking the lights, laughing like a madman. Charlie gives Kate a look. 
KATE (explaining) He's from Canada... 
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Leopold sits at the head of the table, Kate and Charlie banished to either side. Leopold chews his dinner incessantly. 
LEOPOLD (finally) What is this? 
KATE It's called Hamburger Helper. 
LEOPOLD It is beyond help. Please serve the next course. 
He pushes his plate away. 
KATE I'm afraid there is no next course. If you make a list of the foods you like, I'll pick them up at the store for you. 
LEOPOLD Is all food here this... textured? 
CHARLIE Mine's good. 
LEOPOLD Please understand, I am used to a different sort of preparation. Where I come from a proper meal is the result of reflection and study. A recipe is merely a theme which an intelligent cook can plan each time with variation. 
Charlie gives Kate a look. 
LEOPOLD Several courses are served. Menus are often prepared days in advance, timed to perfection. It is said, without the culinary art, the crudeness of reality would make life unbearable. 
CHARLIE In Canada? 
LEOPOLD (after a beat. Firmly) In Canada. 
CHARLIE We have a saying here. "Shake and shake the catsup bottle, none will come and then a lot'll." 
He pours catsup on his dinner. 
KATE (eyes closed, screaming like a fishwife) WHAT IS IT, LEOPOLD?! 
Leopold's bell rings with determination. Kate is off the bed and out of the room. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Kate enters and stops short. Leopold sits at the table ringing a BELL. The dishwasher is open and SPRAYING WILDLY, the blender has spread breakfast shake EVERYWHERE, water is BOILING OVER on the stove, refrigerator, freezer, and every cupboard door is OPEN. Garbage disposal runs FULL BLAST. 
LEOPOLD (calmly amidst the chaos) I cannot seem to find the tea... 
CLOSE UP: Leopold's hand rings a bell with irritation. 
INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - EVENING 
Leopold, Kate, and Charlie stand in front of Charlie's open closet. Leopold selects clothes from Charlie's wardrobe. 
LEOPOLD No... No... No. Good God, no!... Perhaps... 
He tosses them aside carelessly as Charlie seethes. 
CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell. 
INT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING 
Kate and Charlie form a line to the bathroom. Kate checks her schedule and bangs on the door. 
KATE Leopold, your time is up! What's he got, a girl in there? 
INT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING 
Leopold Luxuriates in the bathtub wearing a "Whitecap" marveling at the whirlpool and the instant hot water. He picks up a can of shaving cream and inspects it in wonder. It SPRAYS. 
CLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell. Nothing happens. He discovers the clapper has been stolen. 
INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON 
Kate types, talks and researches simultaneously. She looks up and stops suddenly. 
Leopold appears wearing MANY oddly assorted layers of Charlie's clothes, a bandanna bow tie, Irish woolen cap, bicycle gloves, aluminum baseball bat walking stick. He poses foppishly. 
LEOPOLD I should like to read about modern currency during my bath tonight. See that the tub and basin are scrubbed up. Remnants remain of this afternoons shave. 
Kate nods at him stupefied. Due to the many layers of clothing, he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing skis. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Leopold rings a BIG NEW COWBELL. No one responds. 
INT. CHARLIE'S WORKROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) 
He discovers Kate at her computer, Charlie reading a book. Each are wearing a walkman. 
He stands in front of them and rings his cowbell furiously until they look up. 
INT. STUDY - DAY 
Leopold studies his questionnaire, Kate researches Victorian customs. They simultaneously look up and gaze at the other. A beat. 
Embarrassed, Kate dons her glasses and Leopold shuffles papers. They look up again. Then down. Then get back to work. 
INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Kate sits on her bed with her laptop watching David Letterman. She glances up, laughs out loud. She looks at the dark empty room. No one is there to share it with. Closing her computer, she holds her pillow close to her. She slowly moves to the window and looks out. 
INT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A text book with Leopold's picture inside. Leopold reads the brief summary of his life with heartbreaking astonishment. He moves to the window and looks out. 
EXT. N.Y.C. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Kate and Leopold gaze out of their windows. The camera slowly pulls back until they are swallowed up by the city. 
INT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON 
Kate scans her notes as Leopold paces dully about the room. 
KATE In our last session you intimated there was a symmetrical system regulating the social order of conformity spanning your era. I found this particularly intriguing If I can just find it in my notes... 
A fire engine races by. Leopold dashes to the window then turns back, excited. 
LEOPOLD The fire brigade! 
Kate stares at him blankly. She munches RICE CAKES and drinks water FROM THE BOTTLE. A beat. She returns to her notes. 
LEOPOLD We'd better get to bed... That is... 
KATE Yes... I start work... (she looks at her watch) in three and a half hours. 
LEOPOLD Oh, dear. 
They self-consciously head to their respective rooms. 
KATE It's fine. I'm used to it. 
LEOPOLD You mustn't get too used to it. You'll find life passes you by awfully quickly. 
Kate is struck by his vulnerability for the first time and is moved. She catches herself quickly however. 
LEOPOLD Thank you for... 
KATE (waving it away) Oh! 
They stand at their bedroom doors. 
LEOPOLD Well, goodnight then. 
KATE Leopold?... I don't have a clear handle on this. Perhaps I was wrong keeping you confined to the apartment all this time. I don't know when you'll be able return home... Tomorrow I'll start preparing you for the outside world. And... We'll find your way back. I promise. 
Leopold smiles, still shaken. A beat. They slowly close the doors to their respective rooms. 
INT. HALLWAY - BRIGHT SUNNY MORNING 
Leopold, dressed for an outing knocks on Kate's bedroom door. 
KATE (V.O.) Yes? 
Leopold enters. Kate stands in a slip calmly looking at Leopold. Leopold immediately turns, facing the door. 
LEOPOLD Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was merely... I didn't... 
KATE Is there something you want, Leopold? 
LEOPOLD I merely wanted to see... that is, inquire, on your availability, for an outing... My assimilation and so forth. 
KATE Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of us. I'll be out in a minute. 
LEOPOLD Yes, of course. Splendid. 
He reaches around behind his back and fumbles for the knob. He finally finds it and goes out. 
Kate smiles. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY 
the Brooklyn Bridge, the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue. 
EXT. 5TH AVENUE - DAY 
Kate and Leopold exit The Gap. Leopold awkwardly wears hip Gap casual clothes, a baseball cap on his head. 
LEOPOLD Are you certain this is correct? 
Kate places the cap backwards on his head. She nods approvingly. 
KATE Certainly I'm certain. 
Leopold watches himself in store windows. He CAN'T comprehend it. Kate leads him into Barney's. 
INT. BARNEY'S - DAY 
Leopold stands before the mirror wearing a classic dark suit. He looks FANTASTIC. A fact that is not lost on Kate. 
LEOPOLD Now really. Isn't this better? 
Kate nods back begrudgingly, her breath taken away. 
EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY 
Lincoln Center, Columbus Circle, Gristedes. 
INT. GRISTEDES MARKET - DAY 
Kate selects a shopping cart, begins to push it. 
LEOPOLD Allow me. 
SALESLADY (giving Kate the once over) Yep. 
KATE (staring down at her clothes then back at the two of them) What?... What? 
INT. ROBERTA'S - DAY 
From behind the dressing room door, Kate shouts to the others with irritation. 
KATE This is ridiculous. I don't have time to... (she shrieks) Do you know what this dress costs? Let's get this over with. I'm coming out. Nobody laugh. 
Kate leaves the dressing room in a huff COMPLETELY UNAWARE that she is STUNNING. 
KATE Satisfied? 
Leopold and the saleslady stare at her with pleasure. 
KATE ...What? 
She turns and looks at herself in the mirror. Leopold stands behind her, pulls back her hair, brushes away her bangs. 
LEOPOLD You have a lovely face. 
Even Kate cannot deny that she is lovely. She stares at herself for a long while. 
LEOPOLD (quietly) We'll take the dress. 
They become aware of their close proximity. They nervously part. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Kate sits Leopold down on the sofa. She turns on the TV and hands him the remote control. 
LEOPOLD What is this? 
KATE The drug of the 20th century. 
She aims the remote at the TV, changing channels. He's spellbound. 
INT. DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING 
Dinner is served. Kate waits patiently for Leopold who sits on the sofa watching the TV. 
KATE Leopold, your dinner's getting cold. 
LEOPOLD I'm coming. 
He does not move a muscle. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Kate and Leopold sit on the sofa eating their dinner and watching TV. On the screen, a Looney Tune. Leopold enjoys this especially. Kate reaches for the remote but Leopold grabs it territorially, refusing to relinquish it. 
KATE (making notes) It's a guy thing. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Leopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control. Kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over Leopold. She glances around the room, then slowly bends down close to capture a better look at his face. 
After a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand and sits down at her computer. She opens her notes and types. Her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop. She looks up at Leopold lost in thought. She smiles. 
Reaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to the floor. In a SMASHED frame, Kate and CARLSON drunkenly mug for the camera. Kate pales noticeably. 
She looks from the picture to Leopold. Slowly, she begins pecking away at the keys. She does not look up again. 
INT. LAB - LATE AFTERNOON 
Kate gives Leopold a tour of the lab stopping by Dr. Drakes area. Hidden behind chalk boards, calculator paper, and several empty Haagen Dazs containers, Dr. Drake searches for solutions. 
KATE ...Now within that astronomical structure, Dr. Drake here is searching for a pathway between your time and the present. He'll find it too if his arteries don't harden first. 
LEOPOLD Astounding. 
KATE Once that is discovered, the search begins for the exact time and date travel will be possible. 
They move to Dr. Kau's area. 
LEOPOLD (to Dr. Kau) How are you proceeding? 
Dr. Kau merely grunts. Leopold looks at Kate. 
KATE Don't take it personally. Once Dr. Kau starts working, you just have to wait until her batteries run down. We're all pretty much like that. 
They head into Kate's office. 
The men take their places on the dance floor. They flick their hand twice, inviting their women to dance. Cooly, elegantly, the women approach their partners. After a while Kate looks up, relieved. She stands alone. Ballroom music plays. 
The couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns. Kate dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated YEARNING look spread across her face. 
The instructor approaches with a look of resignation. 
INSTRUCTOR Don't think so much, Katie. FEEL the music. 
KATE (sweating) I am! 
INSTRUCTOR Dancing should not be work. It should be a vacation the body takes from the mind. Let the music wash over you. 
KATE (frustrated) It is! 
INSTRUCTOR Repeat after me: I've got the muusic in me. 
KATE I've got the muusic in me. 
INSTRUCTOR & KATE (overlapping) I've got the muusic in me! 
INSTRUCTOR Keep telling yourself that. 
Kate does. Her instructor shakes her head and moves away. 
Across the room, through the window, Leopold watches, moved. 
LEOPOLD'S P.O.V. -- Over the music, beyond the swirling couples, Kate remains in the corner, dancing with her imaginary partner, fighting valiantly for the right steps, muttering to herself, dancing alone. 
INT. LAB - MORNING 
Dr. Kau SLAMS a large book on Dr. Plodder's desk startling him. 
DR. KAU I've located her. 
DR. PLODDER You didn't! Is she all right? 
DR. KAU No. She's really not. 
Photograph of a SWEATSHOP 1896. The conditions are APPALLING. Positioned among the workers, Julia Carlson, thin, ragged, worn out, stares helplessly into the camera. 
DR. KAU It was taken a year after she arrived. Look at her face! We have to get her back. 
DR. PLODDER Christine, this morning I spoke with the head of funding. They're talking about canceling the project. 
DR. KAU What?! They can't do that! 
DR. PLODDER There's still time. Nothing has happened yet that can't be undone. We'll get her back. We'll put this behind us and we'll get her back. 
The doctors stare at the photograph. Powerless. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - DAY 
Charlie and Leopold work at their easels. Leopold sighs HEAVILY. 
CHARLIE Is there something on your mind? 
There is a pause. 
LEOPOLD This is rather difficult for me. 
CHARLIE ...Uh huh...? 
LEOPOLD I have been in the salon contemplating the reception I have received by the various tradesmen I have visited. I've determined I am lacking the dexterity of modern intercourse. 
CHARLIE Of what?? 
LEOPOLD Social skills. 
CHARLIE Oh. 
LEOPOLD I realize our association has been rather distant and I bear you no ill will. 
CHARLIE You can imagine my relief. 
LEOPOLD The fact is... I need help. 
CHARLIE Why not ask Kate? 
LEOPOLD I would appreciate the masculine point of view. 
CHARLIE Why not ask Kate?... That was a joke. 
WOMAN She's another Babe Ruth. We had no idea. Are you okay? 
Leopold regards them curiously. 
WOMAN What do you have to say for yourself, Elizabeth? 
ELIZABETH I'm sorry! 
Leopold stares hard at the modern familial scene. He doesn't speak. After a long moment: 
LEOPOLD Is this your child? 
MAN Yes. 
Charlie braces for the worst. The little girl stares at Leopold. 
LEOPOLD I see. 
WOMAN C'mon honey, lets go. 
ELIZABETH I want my ball. 
LEOPOLD Just a moment! (bending down to Elizabeth, firmly) Pick a hand. 
She picks his right hand. Nothing. She picks his left. Nothing. Leopold looks surprised then pulls the ball from his ear. She takes the ball and smiles at him. 
LEOPOLD My mother's name was Elizabeth. (then to her parents) She's a beautiful child. You're very lucky. 
MAN What do you say, Elizabeth? 
Elizabeth makes an embarrassed face. 
MAN Thank you. 
Charlie and Leopold continue through the park, Leopold lost in thought. Charlie watches him in surprise. They walk on. 
INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
Leopold talks animatedly. On the table -- Pumpkin pies, pizza pies, and pot pies. 
LEOPOLD I understand pumpkin pies, pizza pies, and pot pies. But I wish someone would explain Eskimo pies. 
He eats a large spoonful of pudding. Kate and Charlie exchange a worried look. 
LEOPOLD You smoke Camel's, you wear Old Spices, and you drink Mountains Dew. It's revolting. (to Kate) The pudding tonight is excellent. Another thing I've noticed, everyone is in a great rush today. Instant Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick, Minute Maid. You'll find there's much to be said for moderation and languor. 
He eats another spoonful. 
LEOPOLD Mmmm. Is it tapioca? 
KATE It's margarine. 
LEOPOLD (taking the spoon out of his mouth) It's marvelous. 
CHARLIE Well, I'm off. 
KATE Me too. Work to do. Where are you going? 
CHARLIE I'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine. It's this coffee house we go to. 
KATE Say hello to Dennis for me. 
LEOPOLD Who is that? 
CHARLIE Dennis is this really good looking friend of mine who doesn't know Kate's alive because SHE doesn't know how to flirt. 
KATE As a rule I don't like to associate with really good looking people. It makes me feel really... I don't know... Smart. But Dennis is a nice guy. 
CHARLIE And he always picks up the check. 
LEOPOLD Sounds enjoyable. I shall join you. 
CHARLIE What? 
KATE That's a wonderful idea! Leopold mentioned how he wanted to meet... People of quality was it? 
CHARLIE Ahhhhh? 
LEOPOLD If you'd rather I didn't go... 
KATE Nonsense! Charlie, you don't want to hurt Leopold's feelings. He's going to think you don't want him to go. 
CHARLIE Oh it's not that. It's just that it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all. I'm not sure you'd have such a good time. 
LEOPOLD You did not tell the truth about Patrice, Charles. 
DENNIS AND BILL CHARLES?? 
CHARLIE What did I tell you, LEO? 
LEOPOLD He informed me you were inconceivably HOT, but I think you're lovely. Exceptionally lovely. 
PATRICE Thank you, Leo. 
CHARLIE (to the waitress) Check please. 
INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 
The subway car is inhabited solely by Leopold, Charlie, and the oldest Ukrainian woman in New York City. Despite the fact that the train is empty, they are all seated on the same bench. 
Charlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at Leopold. The Ukrainian woman hangs on every word. 
CHARLIE Just drop it Leopold. 
LEOPOLD But Charles, it is so ridiculous. I am not interested in her. 
CHARLIE Hah! 
LEOPOLD In any case the problem is not with me but with you. (quietly) You have no idea what it takes to go about courting a woman. From what I've witnessed tonight, it is symptomatic of your entire generation. 
CHARLIE (almost speechless) You are some piece of work, Leopold. 
LEOPOLD Now I do not wish to get personal... 
Charlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the old woman. She rolls her eyes. 
LEOPOLD But you have been of great assistance to me and I feel this is one area where I can be of some real help. 
CHARLIE I'm fascinated. Go on. 
LEOPOLD Now, why was I successful with this young lady and why did you so miserably fail? 
CHARLIE What makes you think she likes you? 
LEOPOLD Well she gave me the number of her telephone and I assumed it meant... 
CHARLIE Go on. 
LEOPOLD As I see it, the girl hasn't an inkling of your intentions. And it's no wonder. You, Charles, are a Merry Andrew. 
CHARLIE A what? 
LEOPOLD A Merry Andrew. 
CHARLIE I am not!! 
LEOPOLD Everything plays like a farce to you. The more wit, the less courage. I believe the modern woman desires passion, protection, sensitivity. No woman wants to be romanced by a buffoon. (the old woman shakes her head) Banter and repartee are fine but you must add to that a different sort of playfulness. 
CHARLIE You think I should pounce? 
LEOPOLD I'm saying you must treat her with respect. Any oaf can attempt a crude pass. A woman of Kate's stature would never respond to an artificial tactic. 
CHARLIE Kate? 
LEOPOLD What? 
CHARLIE You said Kate. 
LEOPOLD I did not. 
CHARLIE Yes you did. Didn't he say Kate? 
The old woman nods. 
LEOPOLD We are discussing your problem. 
CHARLIE Not anymore. You like my sister. 
LEOPOLD Charles... 
CHARLIE She has trouble with men, you know. 
LEOPOLD Perhaps she has not met the right one. 
CHARLIE She has met the right one. HUNDREDS of times. But she pulls back. She cuts herself off. You turn around and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx. 
LEOPOLD One never can tell. 
PATRICE It's beautiful. 
Charlie quickly looks at Leopold pleadingly. He really does not want to say this next part. Leopold, however, is adamant. 
CHARLIE (deadpan) Gracing me with your conversation and company would mean the world to me. 
There is a long pause. Patrice watches Charlie in disbelief. 
PATRICE Um... 7:00? 
CHARLIE 7:00 is fine. I'll call for you then. 
They smile at each other for a long moment. 
LEOPOLD (silently mouthing) Goodbye. 
CHARLIE Goodbye. (she closes the door) It worked! 
LEOPOLD Of course it did. 
CHARLIE Leopold, I... I'm... I have no idea what to do next! 
LEOPOLD Charles. Leave everything to me. 
CHARLIE Not so fast, buddy. You're next. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Kate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time and space. Leopold enters. He is suddenly embarrassed and doesn't know how to proceed. 
LEOPOLD Good morning. 
KATE Good morning. You're up early. 
She moves to her computer on the other side of the room. Leopold follows. Before she can sit down, Leopold pulls out her chair. She falls to the ground. He rushes to her side immediately. 
LEOPOLD I'm terribly sorry!! 
KATE Happens all the time... 
She opens a reference book and slowly begins typing at her computer. There is a pause. 
LEOPOLD Dr. Coles?... ah, Kate? I was wondering... 
She stops working and looks at Leopold. 
LEOPOLD What it is you're working on. 
KATE Oh. It's my computer. 
She resumes her work. 
LEOPOLD I see. Actually I meant the work itself. 
KATE I'm researching the correlations between your time and the present. 
Leopold stares blankly. 
KATE I'm TRYING to get you home, Leopold. 
LEOPOLD Oh. 
Charlie peaks in, signaling Leopold, spurring him on. 
LEOPOLD I have never seen a woman work as diligently and extensively before. 
KATE It's made me the man I am today. 
LEOPOLD It's quite a beautiful day, have you noticed? Perhaps you would permit yourself some time off and grant me the privilege of escorting you around the city this fine Spring afternoon. 
KATE Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I've got too much work to do. Ask Charlie though. He'll go with you. 
LEOPOLD I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the same. It is YOUR company I am seeking. 
Surprised, Kate turns around and looks at Leopold. 
KATE (gently) Oh, Leopold. I'm so sorry. I can't. 
LEOPOLD I see. Some other time then. 
KATE Yes... Thank you. 
Leopold sits at the far end of the room. Kate takes a moment then resumes typing. She STOPS and sits back in her chair. After a long moment, she subtly unplugs the computer with her foot and starts banging on the top of it. 
They collapse on the couch. 
LEOPOLD Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ. 
KATE I don't know. K.D. Lang. 
LEOPOLD I don't know how you keep up with it. I'm exhausted. 
KATE So am I. 
LEOPOLD I'll tell you what. Why don't I prepare dinner tomorrow night? I never have before. I mean even before I hit town. "Hit town" How's that? I can't imagine what it'll taste like, but I don't think it will be any worse than your cooking. 
KATE Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night. 
LEOPOLD I see. 
KATE A blind date. 
LEOPOLD Oh, I'm so sorry. 
KATE No, that just means I haven't met him before. It was set up through friends. 
LEOPOLD Ah! 
KATE A hazard of single life... I'm turning in. 
Kate gets up. Leopold automatically stands. 
LEOPOLD Another time then. 
KATE I'm sorry. 
LEOPOLD It's quite all right. 
As she gets to the door, she stops. 
KATE Leopold? I had a wonderful time today. I can't remember the last time I took the day off and just played. I'd forgotten how beautiful this city can be... I want to thank you for that. 
LEOPOLD The pleasure was mine. 
Kate smiles at Leopold and goes out. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Charlie, in a tie, is standing with Leopold at the dining room table. Kate wearing too much makeup for her date, runs into the bathroom in a BRIGHT RED DRESS. 
CHARLIE It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold. Are you sure you can teach me everything there is to know? 
KATE (from the bathroom) Just don't swipe the silverware and give yourself away. 
CHARLIE Nobody's talking to you. 
LEOPOLD It is very simple. I will be your date. Just behave as you normally would and I'll correct you along the way. Now, escort me in. 
Charlie and Leopold move across the room. After a beat, Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first. Leopold gives his approval. Kate rushes out of the bathroom in a tight BLACK dress. 
Leopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table. Charlie sits down, pleased. Leopold remains standing, incensed. 
CHARLIE Now what? 
Leopold takes a cloth napkin, hits Charlie upside the head. Hard. 
LEOPOLD Pull the chair for a lady! Clod. 
KATE (V.O.) No name calling. 
LEOPOLD (to Kate) Well, really! 
Charlie stands up and pulls out the chair. As Leopold sits, Charlie pushes the chair in to hard. 
LEOPOLD You're not shoveling coal into a furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in gently. Gently. Try it again. 
Charlie gently glides Leopold to the table. He remains standing, not sure what to do next. 
LEOPOLD Well, sit down! 
CHARLIE Now don't burst a vein or anything, but there are quite a few knives and forks here. How do I know what each one's for? 
LEOPOLD Merely start from the outside and work your way in. 
CHARLIE What kind of beer should I order? 
LEOPOLD Beer! 
KATE About you? Ah, she said you were tall. 
LARRY 
KATE And nice looking. 
LARRY Thank you. 
KATE Thank her. And that you persevere ardently on Wall Street. 
LARRY Well, I work there... 
KATE (after a beat) That must be very interesting. 
LARRY (laughing) You've obviously never worked on Wall Street. 
KATE (laughing along for the hell of it) No. 
Their laughter subsides. After a beat: 
LARRY What else did Jeannie say about me? 
INT. THE FOUR SEASONS - NIGHT 
The Maitre d' of this very fancy restaurant shows Charlie and Patrice to their seats. Charlie motions Patrice to go first just as Leopold has instructed. 
The Maitre de pulls out Patrice's chair. Charlie gives him a look to back off. Charlie effortlessly glides Patrice to the table and takes his seat. 
PATRICE Have I told you how much I liked your painting? 
CHARLIE (beaming) Twice. 
PATRICE If you get tired of hearing about it, let me know. I have to admit I was sort of surprised when you called. I didn't think you liked me, Charlie. 
CHARLIE When I first saw you, I thought... (he makes his jaw drop down to the floor) 
PATRICE What do you think now? 
Charlie smiles and places her hand over his heart. Then he makes his jaw drop again. Patrice laughs happily. 
INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT 
Kate and Larry are eating their dinner. 
KATE Aaand that's about all Jeannie said. What did Jeannie say about me? 
LARRY (smiling) She said you were enormously sexy, had a great body, but you don't put out. 
KATE Quite a compelling portrait. 
LARRY (turning on the charm) Would you say it's an accurate portrait? 
KATE (leaning into Larry) A masterpiece. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Leopold slowly carries a dinner tray to the dinning room table. He moves to the window and looks out. After a while he pours a glass of wine. 
INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT 
As they eat their dinner Larry drones on. 
LARRY So this guy wants to invest $50,000 in a stock that's no good. Here's what I do... 
Kate stares absentmindedly at Larry, her mind somewhere else. She looks down at the fork in her hand. She switches to the proper one, reflecting on Leopold's etiquette. She notices her napkin lying flat on the table. She reaches for it. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Leopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap. He begins to eat his dinner. Slowly. Elegantly. Alone. 
INT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT 
Kate places the napkin on her lap. She stares at it a long while. Finally she looks up at Larry. 
EXTREME CLOSE UP OF LARRY 
LARRY I'm telling you the guy was a DICK! A total ASSHOLE! 
KATE (jarred awake) Who? 
LARRY Jeff Murray. The guy I've been talking about. Hello? 
KATE (realizing her feelings for Leopold, smiling radiantly at Larry) Goodbye. 
INT. LIVING ROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT 
The candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow throughout the apartment. Louis Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" plays. Kate and Leopold sit on the couch sipping wine. 
LEOPOLD Tell me more. 
KATE Um, where was I? So after my father died I had to go to work. 
LEOPOLD Have you had many jobs? 
KATE Many. I got fired from all of them. I'm the most unskilled person I know. But they were just survival jobs while I was still in school. I always knew I wanted to go into science like my father. And I did. 
LEOPOLD Do you miss him? 
KATE I think about him every day. He was courtly, just like you. 
LEOPOLD I think you are a remarkable woman Katherine Coles. 
KATE You just don't get out much. You'd be surprised how remarkable I'm not. 
LEOPOLD No, it is you who would be surprised. 
They kiss. Anxiously they stare into each other's eyes. They kiss again. Slowly, Kate leads him to her bedroom door. They look at each other, deciding. 
Deliberately, cautiously, Kate opens the door. 
LEOPOLD Kate... 
Kate puts her fingers over Leopold's lips. Gently she leads him inside. They slowly embrace as the door closes. 
INT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING 
Sunlight floods the room. Clothes are scattered about. Two figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed. One of the figures rolls around. The covers are pulled back revealing: 
CHARLIE Good morning. 
PATRICE Morning. 
They kiss. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
Leopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee. The table is set for a huge breakfast. Kate also in a robe enters from the hallway. There is a moment of awkwardness as they see each other for the first time. 
KATE Morning. 
LEOPOLD Good morning. 
They kiss shyly. Kate notices the feast. 
KATE Look what you've done! 
LEOPOLD It's nothing. 
KATE Nothing? My own mother never made me a breakfast like this. 
LEOPOLD I will have to have a talk with her. 
KATE Leopold... 
LEOPOLD Kate... 
KATE About last night... 
LEOPOLD Please sit down. 
He pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her. 
LEOPOLD Kate, I had never before been a considerate man. I had, with astonishing complacency, squandered my life, waiting for some incentive to force me into action. You have made me see how rare our time here really is. I am most beholden to you Kate. And always will be. 
KATE I sense the word "BUT" entering into this any minute now. 
Leopold takes her hands in his. She looks at him defensively, bracing for worst. 
LEOPOLD Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming my wife. 
Kate lets out a very girlish, high pitched scream 
LEOPOLD Shall I take that as a "yes"? 
KATE Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry you? 
Leopold and Kate sit on her bed watching David Lettering. Kate clutches her pillow close to her. She looks over at Leopold concentrating on the TV with furrowed brow. She smiles sadly. She takes her pillow and flings it off her bed. She snuggles up to Leopold. They watch TV. Together. 
EXT. N.Y.C. - DAY 
Central Park in full bloom, Botanical Gardens, The Frock Museum. 
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 
Leopold and Kate eat lunch. Leopold scans a newspaper. On the TV over the bar, Bob Dole is speaking out against gun control. 
LEOPOLD Public office is apparently still the last refuge for the incompetent. Show me a man who does not want his gun registered and I'll show you a man who should not own a gun. What is a pee-pee girl? 
KATE What are you reading? 
LEOPOLD The Village Voice. After much consideration, I have decided it is time I join the work force. 
KATE As a pee-pee girl? 
LEOPOLD Perhaps not that, but I am determined to acquire honest employment. 
KATE Leopold, I don't know if that's such a good idea. 
LEOPOLD Kate, my life back home was beneficial to no one. I want my new life to have value. I won't make the same mistakes twice. 
KATE You have to be patient. 
LEOPOLD I could conceivably wait my whole life away. 
KATE You're awfully cute when you get causey. 
LEOPOLD I will not waste any more time. I must make a difference. 
INT. BLOOMINGDALES - DAY 
Customers fill the aisles. In the center of it all, Leopold is hard at work. He holds a bottle of perfume. 
LEOPOLD Try our fragrance? Would you like to try our new fragrance today? 
RICH CUSTOMER What is it? 
LEOPOLD It is called, POISON. 
He squirts some at her. 
RICH CUSTOMER Oh! I don't think so. Have you got PASSION? 
LEOPOLD I beg your pardon? 
RICH CUSTOMER Elizabeth Taylor's Passion? 
LEOPOLD Next aisle over. 
She leaves. Leopold looks after her. 
LEOPOLD (after a beat) Give your mother-in-law what she really deserves this season. Give her some POISON. 
INT. KATE'S LABORATORY OFFICE - MORNING 
The doctors enter Kate's office and closes the door. 
KATE Hi. (the doctors remain silent) What's the matter? 
There is a long pause. Slowly Kate realizes the doctors are on to her. She puts down her pen. 
KATE So you know. 
DR. KAU We had to go through your computer to access information. Your calculations have been verified and the final course has been set. Leopold goes back a week from Friday 1:17 a.m. 
DR. PLODDER How long were you going to keep it a secret, Kate? 
DR. DRAKE Were you even going to tell us at all? 
KATE I'm not sure. 
DR. PLODDER Not sure? What can you be thinking? You can't alter the course of history and assume everything will be okay. It won't be. He has his own destiny to fulfill in his own time. 
KATE (quietly) You don't understand. 
DR. DRAKE (gently) He's going back, Kate. 
DR. PLODDER It's over. 
Kate nods. The doctors slowly leave the room and close the door. Just the sound of the clock ticking. 
LEOPOLD Who is this woman sitting across from me? 
KATE What do you want me to say, Leopold? 
LEOPOLD Tell me that you love me as I love you. Let me hear you say it. 
Kate remains silent. Leopold abruptly throws money on the table. 
LEOPOLD I will not do this. I'm sorry. 
We starts out. 
KATE Leopold! 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Leopold walks out of the restaurant trying to remain calm. His emotions get the best of him. Finally, exhausted, he winds up walking along Central Park South. 
Hansom Carriages wait to be taken out. He approaches slowly. He stops along side one of the cabs and strokes the horse's head. 
He looks at the horse for a long time. Then he looks at the skyscrapers surrounding him, deciding what to do. He lays his face against the horse's head, torn. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
Kate sits at the dinning room table behind empty Sara Lee boxes, pints of ice cream, beer bottles, and is working her way through the cookie dough. Leopold enters through the front door, DISHEVELED. 
LEOPOLD Good God. Look at you. You look awful. 
KATE You should see what I'm looking at. 
LEOPOLD I went back to the restaurant. They told me you went out looking for me right after I left. 
KATE That was pound cakes ago. Where were you? 
LEOPOLD I had a lot to think over. 
KATE Such as? 
LEOPOLD Just where I stand around here. 
There is a long pause. 
KATE (quietly) We should have come up with something together. I might have been spared ten or seventy pounds. 
LEOPOLD Is that an apology? 
KATE I'm sorry for what I said. 
Leopold goes to her. He gently prys cookie dough from her hands. 
LEOPOLD I'm not going anywhere. 
KATE Yes you are... 
LEOPOLD I'm not going. I'm staying here with you. 
KATE But? You can't! We have no right to... 
LEOPOLD It is my destiny. It is my decision. 
KATE Have you thought about what you'd be sacrificing? Your influence? Your authority? 
They kiss. 
KATE Your family, your whole way of life, everything? 
They kiss. 
KATE You're not just feeling sorry for me because I ate the contents of the refrigerator, are you? 
They kiss. 
LEOPOLD I love you, Kate. The single most miraculous event in my life was not how I arrived here, but that when I did, I found you. 
KATE (overwhelmed) Here comes the mushy part! 
LEOPOLD After much consideration I've come to the conclusion I no longer desire a large estate with a full staff and ornate grounds. 
KATE That's good, because if you're staying I'll probably get fired again. What do you desire? 
LEOPOLD A beautiful wife, a small home in the middle of nowhere, lots of children, and fine schools with PMS meetings every other Sunday. 
Leopold leads Kate to the dance floor. He opens his arms and Kate steps in the way she was taught in class. Leopold pulls her close. 
This time there is no pretending. Partnered together, they shine. They move beautifully, effortlessly. It's almost more than they can bear. As the music plays, they stop. Leopold holds Kate tightly. They look at each other for the longest time. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LABORATORY - EARLY MORNING 
Large screen computers are working overtime. Kate, Leopold, and Charlie accompany the doctors to the capsule. It is nearly time. 
DR. DRAKE The time tables have been set. Just strap yourself in and you'll be fine. 
DR. PLODDER You have only a twenty four hour leeway before the machine is set to return to us. You must find Carlson within that time frame and get her on board or there will be little chance of her finding a way back. 
LEOPOLD I understand. 
DR. DRAKE It's been a real pleasure. You have a much nicer smile than Ronald Coleman. 
LEOPOLD The privilege was mine. 
DR. KAU Goodbye Leopold, and thank you. (she gives him a kiss) 
LEOPOLD Oh, my. 
DR. KAU Don't worry. We'll send Kate to you... as soon as possible. I'll see to it myself. 
LEOPOLD See that you do. 
DR. KAU You have my word on it. 
The doctors leave. 
DR. DRAKE Four minutes and counting. 
CHARLIE Well? I'll make this quick. Goodbye. 
He sticks out his hand. 
LEOPOLD Goodbye. (impulsively Leopold embraces Charlie) I shall miss you Charles, more than you know. 
CHARLIE I'll miss you too, Leopold... You're the only one who knows how to program the VCR... Take care of my sister. 
LEOPOLD I will. 
CARLSON You better. Take care of yourself too while you're at it... So long. 
KATE I don't have any words for this. 
LEOPOLD I will see you soon. 
KATE I know. 
LEOPOLD You'll be with me all the time. 
KATE I know. I brought you something. 
She takes out a ring and slips it on his finger. 
KATE So you wouldn't forget me. 
LEOPOLD Kate... 
KATE So you wouldn't think this was all a dream. 
They kiss. 
KATE Don't forget about me. 
LEOPOLD I love you, Kate. 
KATE Wait for me. 
LEOPOLD For as long as it takes. 
KATE I will come back to you! I will! 
LEOPOLD I'll be waiting. 
They kiss again for the last time. 
DR. DRAKE It's time Leopold. 
Leopold holds Kate's face in his hands. Very slowly they part. 
CARLSON You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a lot of time to get your affairs in order... And I warn you, it's nearly impossible for an intelligent woman back there. 
Kate stands by the back door, looking out at Leo. 
CARLSON He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would be proud. We're aware of your situation but we felt when the time came, you deserved the option. 
Kate nods, trembling slightly. 
INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT 
Kate stands in the doorway as Carlson drives off. 
LEO Who was that lady? 
KATE Just an old friend. 
LEO What she want? 
KATE (she looks at Leo) Nothing important. You brush your teeth? 
Leo shows off his teeth. 
KATE Then give your old mom a hug and go to bed. (Leo gives her a hug and a kiss) Good night, cookie. 
LEO Good night. 
Kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the house turning off the lights. It is very guiet. All we hear are Kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking. 
She makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room. She sits down by the window at her desk. She sits a long time lost in thought. 
She slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls out an old photo album. She opens it and begins to look through. 
CUT TO: 
THE PHOTO ALBUM 
Inside, old black and white photographs, newspaper clippings, magazine articles trace Leopold throughout his life. 
A photograph of Leopold looking as he did the night he departed this world. He stands stiffly beside his family for a formal portrait. Very discreetly, he points to a ring. It is the same ring Kate gave him. 
A newspaper article shows Leopold donating $100,000 to establish a scientific center researching studies in time and space. 
A magazine picture shows Leopold, the sole male figure, marching to give women the vote. 
A photograph of a large formal wedding. Leopold, around FIFTY, stands alone in the wedding party, surreptitiously pointing to his ring. 
A magazine article shows Leopold in his SIXTIES establishing a scholarship program for studies in physics. He is surrounded by academia and subtly points to his ring. 
A photograph of Leopold around SEVENTY shaking hands with Albert Einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras. 
A professional photograph of Leopold at SEVENTY FIVE, sitting regally in a chair. Beside him, an EMPTY chair. He rests one hand on the back of the chair. The other he holds against his chest, showing off the ring. 
An obituary with the headline, "Philanthropist, 80, dies in bombings. 
A tear falls on the page. 
Kate cries silently, looking out the window. The camera follows her gaze past her property... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BANQUET ROOM - YEARS LATER 
LEO, 24 and his BRIDE take to the floor for the first time as husband and wife and are greeted with applause. Kate, older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder. 
Charlie, standing with Patrice and their 6 blonde children, approaches Kate and leads her to the dance floor. 
KATE He's so YOUNG, Charlie. 
CHARLIE He's old enough. 
KATE Look at that idiotic expression on his face. 
CHARLIE He's happy. 
KATE Of course he's happy. All weddings are happy. It's the living together afterwards that causes all the trouble. 
Julia Carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet hall. She stands at the back of the large room, searching. 
Couples fill the dance floor. Across the expansive room, over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the guests. Leo cuts in. As they spin, in the briefest of seconds, Kate spots Carlson. She pales. They TURN. 
Kate peers over Leo's shoulder. Her eyes lock with Julia's. Julia nods with purpose. Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not wanting to let go. She buries her head in his chest. 
KATE Oh, you're so young... I love you, Leo. Always remember that...

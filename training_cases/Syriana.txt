BRYAN Our position is that there is at least twelve dollars of instability premium in the market. Protests in Iran. Threat of more strikes in Venezuela. The Turks still making noise about Russian crude through the Bosphorus. 
(LISTENS AGAIN) You're welcome, Rebecca. 
12 INT. COLOMBE SUISSE DE BANQUE - GENEVA - DAY 12 
Across the small trading floor, Bryan is sealed off in a mini TV studio, then the lights switch off and Bryan leaves the booth -- TIGHTER ON Bryan as he walks past TRADERS staring into computers while talking into phones -- 
TRADER (O.S.) Long and strong on demand numbers, protests in Iran and, what else is new, the Vens are threatening strike. Place is en fuego -- 
TRADER #2 (O.S.) People want it warmer, colder, they leave their TV's on when they drive to the video store. Twelve bucks of premium -- VINCENT, 30's, depressed, handsome French trader in a beautiful suit, working two phones, sees Bryan -- 
VINCENT 
HEY -- Bryan waves him off, keeps walking. 
VINCENT (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) Market's on its way up. Just thought you should know. 
(TAKES CALL) Done. Yep. Bring him in now. Tell him he's done and bring him in. (yelling to Bryan) Woodman, I need you -- Vincent sees Bryan disappear into his office, door shutting behind him. A small sign reads: RESEARCH. 
13 INT. BRYAN'S OFFICE - DAY 13 
Soundproofed office. Peaceful. Diplomas. Three TVs play: CNN; a black and white image of a pinched OLD MAN; army tanks rolling through Iraq in night vision. Bryan is on the phone. We hear a THREE YEAR-OLD VOICE -- 
RILEY (OVER PHONE) Hello, Daddy. I'm playing. That's my job. Playing. ON BRYAN'S DESK, mounds of research, books, reports, numbers. In the phone Bryan can hear Julie laughing. 
BRYAN (INTO PHONE) That's a very good job to have. 
JULIE (OVER PHONE) Tell Daddy you love him. An abrupt three year-old HANG-UP. Bryan looks up and sees HIS BRITISH BOSS holding a FANCY INVITATION. 
BOSS The Emir's summer party. In Marbella. Any interest? 
BRYAN (re: his piled desk) I can't. I've got all this -- 
BOSS I'm not really asking. 
BRYAN It's Max's birthday. We've got stuff all weekend. Vincent sticks his head in the door -- 
VINCENT September T-I ticked up fifteen cents and is rebounding. Where's the next resistance level? 
BRYAN Read my report -- 
VINCENT (noticing the invite) The Emir's party; I'll take that. Vincent tries to snatch the invite. 
(CONTINUED) 
13 CONTINUED: 13 
BOSS Through much finagling we have an audience with the Emir. He wrote the strategy and he's not slick. 
(TO BRYAN) In fact, take your children with you - a birthday weekend for Max. The towelheads love children. ON TV: JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER in a safari hat leads a group in BAPTIST HYMNS on a croquet lawn while the tanks roll through Baghdad.

14 EXT. TUNDRA - KAZAKHSTAN - DAY 14 
Tundra seen from the air in the ex-Soviet republic. A giant ditch cuts the landscape. In the giant ditch is a giant pipe leading to a ramshackle oil "facility" of shipping containers scattered around a derrick. 
15 EXT. NEAR ATYRAU, KAZAKHSTAN - DAY 15 
A herd of goats scamper out of the way of agiant BULLDOZER with wheels as big as a house. 
16 SUPERTITLE: TENGIZ, KAZAKHSTAN 16 Marching music comes from a tin speaker on a wooden pole. Animal pieces roast on a grill made from oil drums. Oilmen cluster around makeshift wooden tables. BENNETT HOLIDAY, 35, African-American, a clean-cut lawyer, maybe horn rims, starting to grey, sits at a table with RUSSIAN OIL EXECS. The LEADER eats ribs with tiny teeth. 
BENNETT Are you a director or executive of this company? The leader gnaws on a bone. Bennett points down to a mess of contracts and legal papers in front of him. 
BENNETT (CONT'D) Is this your fax number? The leader speaks rapidly in RUSSIAN. Bennett is baffled. Finally, an UNDERLING translates. 
UNDERLING He says, we eat every part of the pony!

18 INT. PLANE - DAY 18 
Business Class cabin. Bennett looks out the window. His POV of clouds and farmland and the Mississippi River. Sydney emerges from First with a scotch and sits. 
SYDNEY You just visited what someday soon could be the most profitable corporation in America. 
BENNETT Provided the government approves the merger -- 
SYDNEY Provided we don't start running cars on water. Provided there's still chaos in the Middle-East. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
18 CONTINUED: 18 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) This ain't the SEC anymore, son, and maybe you got a couple scalps on your belt from your time over there - Enron, World Com - but now the job is find the problem, fix the problem. And if you don't find a problem, then there is no problem. Bennett notices that Sydney wears a Mickey Mouse watch. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) And WHEN the government approves this merger it's gonna buy a lot of houses out on the Vineyard, maybe even yours, so, of course, it's delicate all around. Who's this U.S. Attorney, Donald Farish the 3rd? What's his agenda? Who's behind him? Is it a political force? Another corporation? Is he a glory boy making a name? 
BENNETT I know him. He taught a class of mine at Georgetown Law. Sydney knew this, of course. Sydney looks Bennett over, then he chuckles, the effect of which is unsettling. 
SYDNEY Well, there you go, he taught a class of yours at Georgetown Law. Mr. .Whiting did say to me, I have a feeling about this young man. He said, he can position himself. Sydney stands. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) Hold these guys in a circle. Ask the careful questions. I don't need to tell you this is a hell of an opportunity for you to catch those peers who have spent, how should I put it, less time on the government dole. 
(BEAT) And get rid of that fancy watch, it makes you look like a Jew. Sydney disappears back up into first class, carefully pulling the curtain in place behind him.

Bright sunlight beside the Gulf. 200 foot tall loading tanks with portraits of the Emir. This facility is under construction by Pakistani and Filipino LABORERS. ANGLE ON: SALEEM AHMED KHAN, 40, heavy set, with glasses, and his son, WASIM, 17, tall, bright, wearing electric blue jumpsuits while painting a brown handrail green. A VAN stops beside their team and someone YELLS in Urdu.

They drive with OTHER WORKERS across the refinery. 
21 EXT. REFINERY - DAY 21 
A huge sign in mandarin declares the project funded by CHINA GAS AND ELECTRIC - the Chinese oil conglomerate. 
SUPERTITLE: NATURAL GAS LIQUEFACTION PLANT - PERSIAN GULF Chinese ENGINEERS in white have rounded up a group of Pakistanis who stand together sweating in the extreme heat, an image not much changed since Colonialism. 
ENGINEER (IN MANDARIN) Your services are no longer needed here at the China Gas and Electric facility. A PAKISTANI translates into Urdu for the-group. Find Saleem and Wasim in the crowd -- 
SALEEM (IN URDU) What did they say? I can't hear. 
WASIM They're letting us go. 
SALEEM The whole group? 
WASIM The whole group. In the distance, the engineer is droning on.

21 CONTINUED: 21 
ENGINEER We know you have worked hard and wish to thank you for that hard work with a small cash bonus which you may collect on your way out of the facility. 
SALEEM What did he say? I can't hear. I can't hear. 
WASIM He's telling us to scram. 
SALEEM Scram? What do you mean, scram? ANGLE ON: The engineer pointing toward the exit of the facility. He turns to another ENGINEER nearby. 
CHINESE ENGINEER 
(SOTTO) Look at them standing there. Like blue cows. Shit. Get them moving. 
22 EXT. LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS FACILITY, PERSIAN GULF - DAY 22 
Wasim and Saleem cross the desert near the LNG facility. 
SALEEM The Chinese are smart people, but such bad drivers. They should not be allowed even to wash cars. Wasim doesn't say anything. They walk in silence. Then -- 
SALEEM (CONT'D) When I was your age, in Pakistan, there was always in the distance-- 
36 EXT. EMIR'S ESTATE - MARBELLA - DAY 36 
Bryan and Julie and the kids arrive at the manicured entrance of a vast, impressive estate, their rental wagon anomalous among Bentleys and Rolls. An Arab valet opens Julie's door. The kids are excited. 
37 EXT. GARDEN - DAY 37 
A geometric sculpture garden. Giacomettis and Henry Moores. A TV monitor plays video of gardens and flowers. GUESTS cluster together. You could almost tag labels on them: arms dealer, Ambassador, Minister of Trees. Bryan and Julie and the kids wander into the party. 
BRYAN .I'm probably the tenth guy this month to pitch something like this. It's like the Godfather. Emir, I come to you on this special day. Vincent is riding motorcycles through Cambodia, through land-mines. Some charity thing. 
JULIE That's guilt not charity. He's Catholic and can't view himself as a shallow model f.u.c.k.e.r, which he is. And when war breaks out in some energy producing country, he's the first one into work. Bryan looks at her. 
JULIE (CONT'D) Honey... you're a man who supports his family, not a boy. 
(CONTINUED) 
37 CONTINUED: 37 
BRYAN I thought you like him. Vincent. 
JULIE I do, honey. For you, I like him very much. She takes his hand as they walk. 
VOICE (O.S.) Please, attention please, your host, his majesty, the Emir... ON A TV MONITOR: the Emir, HAMAD AL-SUBAAI, 60's, bearded, overweight, sitting in front of greenery, his TWO SONS behind him, addresses his party guests. 
EMIR (ON TV) It is my pleasure to personally welcome each of you to the Casa De Las Palmas, our oasis of palms in the south of Spain. 
38 INT. EMIR'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY 38 
The EMIR, his two sons, PRINCE MESHAL, late 20's, weak- chinned, effeminate, with longish hair, and PRINCE NASIR, 30's, handsome, with large expressive eyes, close-cropped hair, powerful and serious, are across a table from 
CHINESE OIL EXECUTIVES. The Emir's PRERECORDED SPEECH drones on -- 
EMIR (ON TV) And symbolic of the affection of my people for each of you. At nine o'clock, we will have wonderful music from the London Philharmonic. Please eat and socialize and enjoy. The Emir ignores himself on TV and turns to business. He recently had a stroke and was filmed from his good side. 
EMIR (CONT'D) (a slight slurring) I am happy to welcome the Chinese to my country and optimistic you will not be nearly as greedy as the Americans. Assiduous nods from the CHINESE oil executives as the King's young Japanese SECRETARY slides contracts across. 
39 EXT. POOL PAVILION - DAY 39 
Bryan and Julie watch Max tentatively approach the pool. Nearby, Riley has introduced himself to an Arab family. 
JULIE Arabs are very family oriented, as a people. Is that racist? Max, a book-oriented, rather than water-oriented, child is afraid to jump in. 
BRYAN 
(WATCHING-MAX) Not if what you're saying is positive. A bigger BOY fakes like he might push him in. Bryan starts to his feet -- 
JULIE Don't. Let him work this out. It's important for his autonomy. Max finds his courage, jumps, and disappears beneath the surface, then bobs up happily. Julie smiles. 
BRYAN Hedge strategies are tough for these guys. Oil goes up the people wonder why those extra billions aren't in the treasury. Prices go down, no one's thanking them for saving a few bucks. Julie looks at her husband to determine whether he's testing his "pitch" or in need of encouragement. 
JULIE Make a game of it. Pretend they're six year-olds and you have to get them to eat carrots and all they want is dessert. Make it about good parenting. 
40 INT. EMIR'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DUSK 40 
EMIR The house is a Genius-Home. One of my sons had it wired by experts from the United States. 
(CONTINUED) 
40 CONTINUED: 40 The Emir sort of wilts, fading out. Prince Meshal foists a remote control on his father. The other son, Prince Nasir observes his father and brother. The Emir rouses. He presses a few buttons. The monitors show the estate: lawn; squash court; guard house. 
PRINCE MESHAL watch... ON TV: the image of a rear guard house. Suddenly, the gate slides back, stops, slides the other way. 
CHINESE OIL EXECUTIVE Your Highness, that is incredible. (to Prince Nasir) Prince Nasir, isn't that amazing? 
PRINCE NASIR 
(DISMISSIVE) Fascinating. The Emir presses the remote. ON TV: seven swimming pools. Meshal proudly shares the moment with his father. 
PRINCE MESHAL Oh, look, it's getting dark, better turn on the lights -- ON SIX OF SEVEN MONITORS: pool lights turn on, shimmering turquoise. One pool remains dark. The Emir notices the dark pool. He presses the device. ON THE MONITOR: The lights go off. He presses again. Six pools light up, but one is still dark. The Emir ignores his son and speaks for the room. 
EMIR Send a fool on a fool's errand. Meshal frantically tries to make the pool light come on. 
ON THE MONITOR: ONE IS STILL DARK -- 
41 EXT. POOL SIDE - DUSK 41 
CHILDREN SCREAM, shouting, playing tag in the crepuscular light beside the dark pool. Max is among the children.

Tight on JOHNNY and PONYBOY just before they run to catch the boxcar in THE OUTSIDERS. 
BOY (O.S.) Why are they running after him? 
WASIM (O.S.) Maybe he has a knife or committed a crime or something. Wasim, Farooq, other men and boys watch a small TV in a cheap trailer, housing for immigrant labor. 
SUPERTITLE: FOREIGN WORKERS COMPOUND - PERSIAN GULF wasim sits with Farooq watching the film. YUNUS, 6, watches Wasim, his older brother, with reverence. 
FAROOQ They gave us french fries at the Madrassa. Wasim's father, Saleem, enters with a few groceries. 
WASIM Papa, close the door. 
ANOTHER FRIEND His sister has a thing for you. 
WASIM His sister has a big ass. 
(TO FAROOQ) Of course, at the Madrassa you don't have to worry about that. 
FAROOQ And lamb. We got skewers of lamb. 
YUNUS I like lamb. The children's faces are lit by the TV'S glowing light.

53 EXT. GOVERNMENT PLAZA - DAY 53 
Against a wall, YOUNG MEN are frisked by police who tap their legs apart with batons. Above them a watchful portrait of the Emir, in epic pose, astride a stallion. A line of Pakistani and Filipino MEN winds out of a building. People are paranoid. No jokes. Eyes darting. As more MEN arrive, POLICE in riot gear watch them, shouting in Arabic into a bullhorn. Yunus watches Wasim and Saleem. He mimics how his brother stands. An OLD MAN tries to talk to them. 
OLD MAN Hot today. Can't remember the streets this hot. Saleem looks around, sees if anyone was listening, then takes the old man's arm. 
SALEEM You don't want to talk here. Suddenly, a POLICEMAN shoves Saleem from behind. Saleem turns to the officer, already apologizing, but Wasim steps between them. The cop pushes Wasim with his baton. 
POLICEMAN Tough guy? Is that right, tough guy? What's your name, tough guy? Wasim doesn't say anything. Yunus watches his father and brother. The cop pokes Wasim again with the stick -- 
POLICEMAN (CONT'D) What's your name? 
WASIM Johnny. The policeman swiftly brings his club down on Wasim's head, dropping him to his knees. other POLICEMEN close. Saleem gets in the middle, but is beaten down. Wasim tries to reach for Yunus who is SCREAMING and hitting at the policeman's legs. A club comes down on Wasim's head --

Tight on note cards of "conversational topics" and reminders to be "natural." A perfect MOTHER and FATHER coach their PERFECT NERVOUS DAUGHTER. 
NERVOUS DAUGHTER I learned the value of diversity in my time at the Model U.N. And, across the rich leather and wood anteroom of a Princeton admissions office, Bob and Robby also wait. 
ROBBY Maybe you'll get made Ambassador to somewhere cool, like France or Italy or Ghana. What's your dad do? He's Ambassador to Ghana. That's so cool. I know. Bob looks over at his son like he doesn't really know who this person is, which he doesn't. 
BOB How's your mom? 
ROBBY 
(FORCED GAIETY) Great! She's great'. The Perfect Family glances over at them. After a beat -- 
ROBBY (CONT'D) Do you know what mom's job is? 
BOB she's a secretary. 
ROBBY What did she do when you met her? 
BOB She was a secretary.

FARISH Not anymore. 
59 INT. SQUASH COURT - DAY 59 
The SHARP SOUNDS of SQUASH. Looking through the opaque square of Plexiglas in the door to a squash court, Sydney and Bennett grunt and lunge and sweat. 
SYDNEY I took a bit of a temperature reading. The other associates seem to like you. That's not really a good sign. 
BENNETT I'm sorry, Sir. HIGH ANGLE - down to the fishbowl aspect of the court. Sydney has a very good serve. As they talk he wins three points in a row, Bennett lunging at the spinning ball. 
BENNETT (CONT'D) Sir, I don't want to get ahead of myself, but Kazakhstan... You got capitalists with a K -- Point. 
SYDNEY Six apiece.

HONEST -- 
SYDNEY Inherited a ton of dough -- Point. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) Seven.- Six. Already got his mind made up. Got his teeth in it like a little terrier. As Sydney is talking, he wins the point. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) Eight - Six. Match point. 
BENNETT I think they've got someone inside the deal. Somebody they can squeeze., 
SYDNEY Like an informant? 
BENNETT Yes, Sir. Like an informant. Just my feeling based on their overconfidence. Sydney aces Bennett. 
SYDNEY Match! He turns and holds out his hand. 
60 INT. CLUB ROOM - DAY 60 
The casual bar of a fancy, D.C. Men's Club. Very old money. Lots of power. Membership includes one woman, one Jew, and Vernon Jordan. Bennett and Sydney eat lunch. 
SYDNEY If people in oil deals talked to U.S. Attorneys, there'd be no oil business. DEAN WHITING, 60's, congenial, but powerful in build, an ex-marine, an insider for forty years, wanders over.

60 CONTINUED: 60 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) Dean, you know Bennett Holiday. 
BENNETT Good to see you again, Sir. 
SYDNEY We've been discussing the Connex- Killeen merger situation. 
WHITING Will they get approval? Helluva large company if they do. I mean, client. 
BENNETT I don't know, Sir. The Tengiz field, Killeen's largest asset, is being looked at pretty heavily by the U.S. Attorney's office. Sydney Hewitt nods to another club member. Bennett turns to see DONALD FARISH III joining a far table. 
WHITING Well, Bennett, as they say in the bible, there are many, many ways to light Europe.

61 INT. BEDROOM - WOODMAN HOUSE - NIGHT 61 
A light SWITCHES ON. Bryan and Julie are both awake listening to Riley CRYING down the hall. It's unnerving, but neither one moves right away, perhaps hoping he'll fall back asleep. 
JULIE I wish I could just believe he's floating around on a cloud or in the corner watching us. Julie wants Bryan to comfort her, but he doesn't. 
BRYAN That minister eulogizing our child made me sick. How do you eulogize a child? He was great at playing. He loved popsicles. She rolls into him and he holds her, but he's staring at the ceiling as the child's cries echo down the hallway. 
62 INT. RILEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 62 
Bryan opens the door to his son's bedroom. Riley is standing in his crib, crying inconsolably. 
RILEY (his voice catching) I want to look out the window. He holds up his arms for his father who lifts him. They walk to the window. Riley stops crying instantly, as children will, and shimmies out of his dad's arms. At the window, they stand together, silhouetted against the dark night and distant street light.

Bob and Stan drunkenly exit T.J. O'Toole's into the standard suburban mall parking lot. There is a bright multiplex sign. FAMILIES and TEENAGERS stroll. 
STAN I like consulting. No, I love it. Love it. And I'll say this for it, private business is efficient. There I said it. Fucking cliche. And the CIA is like what, a thirty billion a year business. so anybody wants to sell anything, a pencil, a computer, they gotta interface through a security clearance -- don't give me shit -- I got two kids in college and we're doing our kitchen. 
BOB Stan, I got a chance to go back. I want to go back. Is it safe for me?

DANNY D. Is the Caspian a lake or a sea? 
BENNETT Sea. Caspian Sea. Like seashore. 
DANNY D. Looks like Lake Michigan. Size of Lake Michigan. The Red Sea opens into the Indian Ocean -- Jimmy Pope and OTHER HUNTERS drink and clean thirty ought sixes, their faces lit by firelight. 
JIMMY Caspian's surrounded. Like a pond. Caspian pond. 
DANNY D. France and Russia want it to be a pond, that's for damn sure. The Caspian, I mean. In some court somewhere right now.

BENNETT The other side? 
JIMMY El Presidente Nazerbayev's best pal in the whole world. 
DANNY D. It's a beautiful field. Goddamn, is it a beautiful field. Danny hands a clean, checked rifle to Bennett.

DANNY D. (O.S.) I believe in getting inside their personal space. So it's you and him and nothing else. That's eighteen yards for a tiger or rhino... Bennett and Jimmy ride in the back of a "wagon," a modified shooting platform pulled behind a Jeep. 
73 INT. TAXI - BEIRUT - DAY 73 
Bob rides in a taxi through the streets of Beirut, a city that was once the Paris of the Middle-East: dust, noise, construction cranes, and knock-off designer clothes. 
SUPERTITLE: BEIRUT, LEBANON They turn off the wide airport road into a warren of narrow streets. The cab stops and the driver turns -- 
CABBIE Southern Suburbs. Bob happily waves him on. Streets narrow. People stare. 
BOB How can you tell if you're talking to a Shiite or a Sunni Muslim. 
(BEAT) If you feel like Shee-iteing your pants you know. The driver glances at Bob in the rearview. OUTSIDE a MAN has a gun stuck in his waistband. Another MAN on a roof has a rifle. A paranoid, guarded place. They turn and suddenly a metal gate is across the road. MEN pour out around the car. Flannel shirts, olive drab army shirts, beards, no beards, guns in waistbands. Bob's door is opened and he is yanked from the cab. 
BOB (CONT'D) I'm here to see Said Hashimi. They roughly frisk Bob. 
BOB (CONT'D) Hashimi. Said Hashimi. They take his pen, remove his belt, check his passport: it's Canadian. Bob's picture. The name is SEYMOUR RISEN. They check his license: the name is SEYMOUR RISEN.

1970's Arab architecture. Large room. Wide doorway. Wide hallway. Wide stairs. No direct sunlight or sight-lines. LOCAL FARMERS, WORKERS wait. Flannel crosses to Olive Drab. Both have guns in their waistbands. They talk quietly, then laugh. Bob sits on a low couch. Opaque glass separates two rooms and shadows move behind it. SOMEONE offers Bob hot tea. A door opens and a man signals for Bob, who gets up, holding his pants. 
75 INT. HASHIMI'S ROOM - DAY 75 
Dim light. An air-conditioner hums in the wall. SAID HOSSEIN HASHIMI, 80's, Tolstoyan grey beard, turban, rheumy eyes, the spiritual leader of the Hezbollah, sits in a high-back chair in a corner. Bob sits in a high-back chair near Hashimi. The young men revere Hashimi and guard him carefully. 
SAID HASHIMI I have a good feeling about American people, Bob. A good people. A welcoming people. There are ten million Muslims in the U.S. I have over 300,000 followers in Detroit alone. 
BOB Thank you for this audience. I have a business proposal for Mussawi. One that benefits everyone. Hashimi nods magisterially. 
SAID HASHIMI Mussawi is an energetic young man. 
(BEAT) Your Arabic is very good. 
(CONTINUED) 
75 CONTINUED: 75 The power CUTS OUT. The air-conditioner SLOWLY DIES OUT. It's near dark in the room. The guards move nervously toward Bob and Said Hashimi. 
BOB I thought it would also be prudent to say, I have no interest in Hezbollah. This is business and it doesn't concern Hezbollah. In the distance a dog barks and chickens cluck. After a beat, Hashimi turns his rheumy eyes on Bob. 
HASHIMI If what you say is true, consider yourself welcome in Lebanon. The generator comes on with a distant WHIR. The lights come on. A man crosses to the air-conditioner, reaches up and trips the circuit breaker, bringing it back to life. 
CUT TO: 
76 INT. GROTTO - BEIRUT - DAY 76 
An ancient grotto where the early Christians used to hide, be discovered, and executed. A tourist attraction, it's a cool, vast, dimly lit, subterranean space. Bob reads a description of a stalactite formation. He is alone, waiting for someone. The grotto ECHOES. In the distance, TWO ARAB SCHOOL CHILDREN, playing with the echoes, do a little dance step and rap out, in broken English, a well-known American SONG. 
MUSSAWI I gotta ask you one question. Amin Shehab... car accident? Bob turns to look at MUSSAWI, 30's, closely-shaved bullet head, seemingly good-natured, a businessman, he speaks English with a New Jersey accent. 
BOB Yeah, sure. Only one of them was propelled by gas and the other by 
C-4. 
MUSSAWI The papers said heart attack. Bob nods pleasantly. 
(CONTINUED) 
76 CONTINUED: 76 
BOB He saw an engine coming at him at 27,000 feet per second and his heart stopped. This settles a beat. 
MUSSAWI Rumors of Bob, but never Bob. It is Bob, right? What is it you tell people you do these days, Bob? 
BOB I'm between State Department and Defense. Bob surreptitiously looks around to see if Mussawi is alone. It's clear Bob makes him nervous as well. 
MUSSAWI Just me, buddy, as requested. Bob reaches inside his jacket. Mussawi reaches in his. 
BOB I'm getting some information, Jimmy. 
MUSSAWI My name is Mussawi. Bob hands a picture to Mussawi. 
BOB Okay, Jimmy. Mussawi glances down at the picture. It surprises him. ANGLE on the picture of PRINCE NASIR crossing a street. Bob has a small pad on which he scribbles a dollar figure. Mussawi glances at the number. He's impressed. 
MUSSAWI He's traveling to Beirut. It's dangerous to travel. He'll disappear. 
PRINCE NASIR Don't see many Occidentals these days. Bob doesn't say anything. 
PRINCE NASIR (CONT'D) It's too bad. Bob nods again. As the elevator moves higher more light floods in through the wire mesh. Bob's eyes meet Nasir's.

Prince Nasir, Bryan, and bodyguards sit with a larger party across the rooftop garden. Bob sits by himself eating a sandwich. From below there is the distant THUMPING of a car stereo. A little bird dances along the railing watching for crumbs. All of Beirut is spread out below. PUSH past the bird over the railing where seven floors below a Toyota Land Cruiser pulls around the hotel. 
94 INT. ALBERGO LOBBY - DAY 94 
An EMPLOYEE approaches another EMPLOYEE at the desk and furtively pulls her away. ANGLE THROUGH A DOOR to the front of the hotel, which is now completely empty, except for the Toyota Land Cruiser with dark tinted windows and five antennae. The stereo is thumping some odd AMERICAN SONG. 
95 EXT. ROOFTOP GARDEN - DAY 95 
Bob puts down bills for his check. The waiter is nowhere to be seen. There's no one behind the bar. No one at the waiter's station. Bob glances over at Prince Nasir who is laughing at something in the Wall Street Journal. 
96 INT. ALBERGO LOBBY - DAY 96 
Shots of the empty lobby, someone DINGING the bell. Everyone has disappeared. 
97 INT. ALBERGO HALLWAY - DAY 97 
Bob outside his hotel room door. The hallway is empty. 
98 INT. BOB'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY 98 
Bob enters his room, chaining the door. He turns and THREE MEN with guns are standing there. He's slammed against the door. Duct tape around his mouth, his arms taped back, his legs wrapped. A black duffel bag goes over him, swallowing the light. 
99 EXT. LAND CRUISER - DAY 99 
The duffle is heaved into the back of the Land Cruiser with a THUD. The trunk gate is slammed -- 
MATCH CUT TO: 
100 EXT. SMALL WAREHOUSE - DAY 100 
The doors of a UPS truck open. Boxes loaded on a dolly. Follow the dolly into -- 
101 INT. SMALL WAREHOUSE - DAY 101 
A small warehouse. Roll past a few desks, some lamps. The dolly stops. Tilt up to find -- Bennett finishing a file and starting another. And beyond, a DOZEN PARALEGALS and the mountain of boxes holding 1.3 million pages of documents. Bennett's phone VIBRATES loudly. He checks the number. 
102 INT. BAR - DAY 102 
Tight on a hand written "business" card that says, "If you find me, call my son, Bennett Jr., at this number." Bennett takes the card from a bartender and finds his father slumped in the corner of a seedy bar. 
CUT TO: 
103 INT. BARE BULB APARTMENT - DAY 103 
A rundown kitchen. The windows are sealed. In another room three MEN eat lunch, sharing a two liter bottle of Mecca Cola, gossiping in Arabic. 
(CONTINUED) 
103 CONTINUED: 103 On a wooden table is a generator, a homemade shocking device the size of masonry brick with a long wire to the generator, and a thick pair of rubber gloves. Bob is duct-taped tightly to a chair. His face is battered. His mouth is cracked. He's severely dehydrated. His hands and feet are dark purple and swollen. A door opens. FOOTSTEPS. Mussawi's VOICE -- 
MUSSAWI (O.S.) Bob, what do you know about torture methods used by the Chinese on the Falun Gong? Number one method? What's your guess? Water dungeon? Did-you guess water dungeon? Impractical here. Bob's POV of Mussawi crossing to the generator. He uses the hand crank, which makes a grinding SOUND. 
MUSSAWI (CONT'D) Number two method? Number two: twisting arm, putting face in feces. Not interested in two. Number three? Number three they call pulling nails from fingers. What do you think, Bob? Does Number three sound good to you? He lets go of the generator and picks up an evil-looking pair of pliers the size of bolt-cutters. Bob's POV over his own hands as Mussawi approaches. 
MUSSAWI (CONT'D) The purpose is to get them to recant their beliefs. Mussawi circles behind Bob who tries to speak but his throat is too dry. Other MEN hold the chair steady. 
MUSSAWI (CONT'D) What if I had to get you to' recant? That would be difficult, right? Because if you have no beliefs to recant, then what? Bob wiggles his hands as if they could escape. SOMEONE mashes Bob's right hand flat, splaying the fingers. 
MUSSAWI (CONT'D) You're fucked is what. The pliers fix on the nail of his pinkie. 
(CONTINUED) 
103 CONTINUED: ( 2) 103 
MUSSAWI (CONT'D) Bob, you're gonna give me the name of every person who has taken money from you. Bob stares at him. Says nothing. Slowly Mussawi pulls with the pliers. Bob's eyes half- close. Mussawi jerks away. There's a fingernail in the pliers. Mussawi retches. 
MUSSAWI (CONT'D) Ugh. That's disgusting. Bob is dazed. They throw water in his face. 
MUSSAWI (CONT'D) Come on, Bob. Help me out here. As water drips down Bob's face he holds his tongue out and drinks. His voice returns. 
BOB 
112 EXT. THE SONG OF ROLAND - NIGHT 112 
The fantail of Prince Meshal's yacht, SONG OF ROLAND, one of many beautiful boats, anchored off Juan Les Pins. A dinner party in progress. The tinkle of crystal and music. Candles flicker. Glowing people. 
113 INT. PRIVATE SALON - NIGHT 113 
Cognac swirls. A gold cigar cutter slices off the tip. Dean Whiting, Meshal, and REZA BARHANI, a middle-man, light expensive cigars in a book-lined study on the boat. 
REZA BARHANI Capitalism cannot exist without waste. On the walls pictures of Meshal as a child with Reagan, Qaddafi. As a teenager with Clinton, King Fahd, Mitterrand, Chernomyrdin. 
(CONTINUED) 
113 CONTINUED: 113 
REZA BARHANI (CONT'D) We should write thank you notes to Mr. Whiting and. the USA for producing one quarter of the world's garbage and one quarter of the demand. 
WHITING You're certainly welcome. Ha, ha. Our pleasure, really. Bonhomie galore. But Meshal is either wary or stupid or both. Reza points to a glass case where a huge leather- bound book is displayed. 
REZA BARHANI Prince, that is a rare treasure. 
(TO WHITING) The First Arab edition of Dr. Johnson's dictionary. Meshal stares. It's his, but means nothing to him. 
WHITING Prince, is there anything we can do for you? The Prince thinks about this for a beat. 
PRINCE MESHAL Americans are very happy to drill holes in other people's countries. 
(TO WHITING) I've heard of you. The cat's paw of the Saudi Princes. Whiting and Reza exchange a quick glance, but this is what Dean Whiting lives for. 
WHITING I know your brother, the foreign minister. Very bright. I know your father, too. He threw the second creepiest party I've ever been to in Washington. And from what I can tell you could probably use a bit of a cat's paw yourself. Second born son so beaten down by his family he can't even tell me what he wants when he's asked straight out, a grown-up baby who hates his brother and maybe wants to be king, maybe. 
(MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
113 CONTINUED: ( 2) 113 
WHITING (CONT'D) Well, Prince, are you a king? Can you tell me what you want? The Prince is at first taken aback, but then takes a beat to consider the offer. Whiting and the Middle-man wait. 
PRINCE MESHAL I do have one small dream, a selfless dream. At my house I have a perfect one-third replica of Hyde Park. I have ducks and deck chairs from the real Hyde Park. 
(BEAT) I wish for a monument to the success of the moors in Europe in the 8th century. 
REZA BARHANI That already exists. It is called the Alhambra. 
PRINCE MESHAL A replica in my country to inspire the people and a new Cordoba Valley from which to view it. It took the masters a hundred years, but I believe we can do it in ten. 
(BEAT) By the way, do you know that my brother does not believe in God? Whiting sips his cognac and, considering the Prince, does indeed look like a cat digesting a canary.

Wind ripples across the leaves of corn. Wasim's hand pulls weed grass. Farooq smiles mischievously. 
115 EXT. MADRASSA "YARD" - DAY 115 
Wasim, Farooq play soccer. Farooq is a natural athlete. 
WASIM The spider is a symbol of the sin of man. He bites the finger of Peter Parker who is now half dark and half light. 
(CONTINUED) 
115 CONTINUED: 115 
FAROOQ A real spider captures, then stings and immobilizes, then watches as the prey takes days to die. 
WASIM They'd never show that. Suddenly they stop. MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA, the blue-eyed Egyptian, has been watching them. They are embarrassed. 
FAROOQ Are we in trouble? MSA smiles a patient, charismatic, spooky smile. They already know each other. 
MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA Look around you at your family... In an OPEN AIR CLASSROOM the Cleric leads young children in recitation of the Koran. Boys walk to class. Boys plow a field. 
MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA (CONT'D) Look around you at your brothers united by faith in God Almighty and submission to his law. A bull sleeps in the shade. 
FAROOQ Wasim is still a virgin. Wasim lightly shoves Farooq. 
MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA That is good because fornication is a serious crime.

119 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - WALTER REED - DAY 119 
Bob in his bed. He stares out the window at a red brick wall, a fragment of sky. He sees MARGARET in the doorway. 
MARGARET In their helpful way they told me you were at one of six places but since you were a number and not a name did I happen to have that number. No. No is the answer to whether I have your number. She rests her hand on the railing of the bed. On the verge, she looks away, then back again. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) They wouldn't give me any information. I didn't know how to find you, what I'd find... He pulls her close, careful of his bandaged hands. 
BOB I'm okay. I'm fine. Hey -- 
MARGARET (into his chest) They wouldn't tell me a thing. Not one thing. He holds her. As she becomes aware of the bandages on his hands, as her worry has been abating, anger has ineluctably filled in behind. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Where were you, Bob? He looks at her; he can't tell her the truth. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Were you back in Beirut? He just stares. This is infuriating. 
MARGARET (CONT'D) Bob, please tell me where you were and tell me what happened. Please. Bob motions for her to come closer. 
(CONTINUED) 
119 CONTINUED: 119 
BOB I saw these Shiites selling an Egyptian a missile. In Iran. I had a feeling about this guy, a Sunni nut-job, but I'm back here where I got on the wrong side of Terry, then an opportunity just happened to come up involving someone I worked with before, not a radical, I mean, he went to Rutgers, only now he flips, wants to cut my goddamn head off. And now they got me isolated away in here and they send these suits around asking me nonsense questions about bad people who are no longer with us, no longer with us on their goddamn orders. So you tell me what happened. You tell me, Margaret. Margaret doesn't know what to say so she says nothing.

Arabs strolling along the street. Nasir and hisfamily shop in an expensive jewelry store. 
121 INT. HOTEL PRESIDENT WILSON - DAY 121 
Arabs stare out windows at the rain. Doors are open. People mingle. Smoke is in the air. A young WOMAN walks by, holding the hand of a much older MAN, laughing at something he's saying. 
122 INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT 122 
Bryan plays Monopoly with a group of young Arab MEN. They are using real money. The "bank" is stacks of hundreds and fifties and twenties. They smoke and drink. An Arab youth moves the silver top hat. 
ARAB YOUTH Shit. Park Place. Shit -- Park Place with hotels. Bryan holds Park Place. The Arab Youth takes off his diamond encrusted Rolex and tosses it toward the bank. 
ARAB YOUTH (CONT'D) Where are you from in the States? 
(CONTINUED) 
122 CONTINUED: 122 
BRYAN El Segundo. No one has heard of it. 
BRYAN (CONT'D) It's near Los Angeles. 
ARAB YOUTH Movie stars, convertibles? 
BRYAN El Segundo is like Saudi Arabia with a surf break. They hoot and protest. They don't believe him. 
BRYAN (CONT'D) It's a desert town on an ocean controlled by an oil company. Tankers lined up offshore. There's this smell in the air. They pass out flyers to families moving in. This town is a quiet town where everyone works and our families are happy. If you have a problem with it or if you don't like the smell, you can leave. 
ARAB YOUTH If anyone works, it can't be Saudi Arabia. They all LAUGH LOUDLY, then the laughter fades as they realize Julie and Riley are in the hotel room. Julie eyes the money and the Asian girl in the corner. 
JULIE He wanted to say good night to his father. Riley goes over and stiffly gives Bryan a hug.

HOTEL SECURITY GUARD You're not on the list. You don't have a badge and you don't have a wristband. Bennett looks at the three guards. He pulls out a card and scribbles ONE WORD on the back. 
BENNETT Take this to Sydney Hewitt. Now. 
(BEAT) Please. INSIDE THE ROOM the guard makes his way to Sydney Hewitt and hands him the card. 
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE Their hopes are the same as all people in every land: to lead lives of dignity in a nation at peace. And America will help them. APPLAUSE as Sydney looks up sharply. At the head table: Dean Crutcher, Reza, and Tommy clap along heartily.

130 INT. CONNEX BOARDROOM - DAY 130 
Tommy, his PERSONAL LAWYER at his ear, -- 
TOMMY Not to my recollection -- Bennett and Sydney square off against Tommy, Jimmy, their personal lawyers, one apiece. 
BENNETT Killeen Oil through Daniel Dalton and PetroKa Energy Consultants created assetless shell companies owned by the heirs of President Nazerbayev. This was. discussed... (checks his notes) At the Upstream Division Meeting held in January of 2003 in Sun Valley, Idaho? 
TOMMY I was at the meeting, but I don't focus on those kinds of details. 
(CONTINUED) 
130 CONTINUED: 130 
BENNETT Wherein it was described that Killeen bore all financial risk, but President Nazerbayev's children, while attending The Lily School in Switzerland, were entitled to all of the profits - seventy million dollars. Tommy's personal lawyer leans in and whispers in his ear. 
TOMMY I attended the meeting but, as I said, I don't focus on those kinds of details. 
BENNETT Daniel Dalton Jr. and PetroKa Energy Consultants -- 
TOMMY'S LAWYER A firm retained by Killeen well prior to Connex's involvement -- 
JIMMY Oh, fer Chrissakes, Tommy, we both got letters from the Grand Jury, it's not your own private little pity party -- 
BENNETT A good faith purchaser is in good faith only if they didn't know about the problems at the time of the purchase -- 
TOMMY This is the oil business we're talking about, right? 
JIMMY The lowliest little shareholder knows we deal with some of the most stank places on earth -- 
BENNETT It is illegal to offer gifts, money or the promise of money or anything of value to influence foreign officials -- 
(CONTINUED) 
130 CONTINUED: ( 2) 130 
JIMMY Oh, is it? I have personally seen a bill from this law firm to the government of Saudi Arabia for 36 million dollars. A one line bill for services rendered.

The ARAB YOUTH exits the hotel and runs across the wide waterfront square. He cuts for a lone figure sitting on wall. He runs up to Bryan. 
ARAB YOUTH They've sued the Emir on the Isle of Jersey and frozen his money. He was in Bulgari and his credit card stopped working. 
132 INT. NASIR'S SUITE - DAY 132 
Prince Nasir tosses a newspaper at Bryan -- 
PRINCE NASIR Some people, cousins of mine actually, sued my father in The Commonwealth alleging that he broke agreements to repay funds transferred from the State. Bryan follows Nasir. He glances at a photo of AGGRIEVED ARABS leaving court with DEAN WHITING looking protective. 
BRYAN A Mareva injunction? 
PRINCE NASIR Aggrieved Royals. Aggrieved about what? That he tried to cut their allowances from one hundred thousand a month to eighty. They pass wife, children, hangers-on. Room after room. 
(CONTINUED) 
132 CONTINUED: 132 
PRINCE NASIR (CONT'D) There are 300 years of corrupt layers in the middle-east and you have to break the ice. There must be structural changes. I tell them, with just one of your boats you could revolutionize Yemen, build desalinization plants. The man with the 200 foot boat needs a 250 foot boat. The man with 250. now needs 300. They dead-end in a small office. The Emir's JAPANESE SECRETARY half-rises. 
STAN Questions two and three seem obvious to me. Missiles are everywhere. Christ, Casey gave 'em out like party favors. This damage assessment, well, let's just say Nasir wasn't a home run. They're worried. About fall-out.

138 CONTINUED: 138 
STAN (CONT'D) They're worried you may want to talk about it. But if you're already under investigation? 
BOB What about Mussawi? 
STAN Mussawi's a soldier. He's just like you. Bob stares at Stan who continues. 
STAN (CONT'D) Maybe he found God. Maybe he was having a bad day. Maybe Americans shouldn't travel these days. 
BOB Did Prince Nasir hide Mohammed Sheik Agiza in the Water Ministry? Does he fund terrorist organizations? 
STAN Tell people what they want to hear and they have a better chance of believing you. People were paid to lie, coached on their polygraphs. Single sources spread through different intelligence agencies that don't communicate with each other. You know how it's done. 
BOB Who's worried about the Nasir job? Stan, who's worried about me talking? On the screen: a LOUD, ACTION BEAT. Stan leans over and

DANNY D. Some trust fund prosecutor, got off-message at Brown, thinks he's gonna run this up the flag pole, make a name for himself, maybe get elected some two-bit, no-name congressman from nowhere, with the result that Russia or China can suddenly start having, at our expense, all the advantages we enjoy here. No, I tell you. No. 
(MINCING) But, Danny, these are sovereign nations... Sovereign nations! What is a sovereign nation, but a collective of greed run by one individual. But, Danny, they're codified by the U.N. charter. Legitimized gangsterism on a global basis that has no more validity than an agreement between the Crips and the Bloods! Passing people shoot sidelong glances. A GROUP of men in suits are clearly waiting for Danny D. 
DANNY D. (CONT'D) Corruption charges. Corruption? Corruption ain't nothing more than government intrusion into market efficiencies in the form of regulation. That's Milton Friedman. He got a goddamn Nobel prize. We have laws against it precisely so we can get away with it. Corruption is our protection. Corruption is what keeps us safe and warm. Corruption is why you and I are here in the white-hot center of things instead of fighting each other for scraps of meat out there in the streets. 
(BEAT) Corruption... is how we win. Danny D. winds down. Finally -- 
BENNETT You broke the law, Mr. Dalton. 
DANNY D. Oh, who gives a shit! 
(CONTINUED) 
139 CONTINUED: (2) 139

140 EXT. CAPITOL HILL -- WASHINGTON, D.C. - DAY 140 
Sydney approaches Bennett who eats his lunch outside the law offices of whiting and Sloan. 
SYDNEY How'd it go? Think you'll get invited on any more hunting trips? 
BENNETT He has kids. He's got a wife. 
SYDNEY He broke the law. Sydney holds out a golden envelope to Bennett. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) Mr. Janus himself wanted me to extend an invitation to oilman of the Year. He's being honored so it should be a nice weekend. Relax. Get a massage. Congratulations. Perhaps the slightest flicker of distaste crosses Bennett's face. On the reverse the Capitol Building is so close you could reach out and touch it.

Pictures of Whiting on a camel, with Persian friends at oxford in the sixties. Whiting is an Arabist. The motion sensor light is on. Whiting tries a window. 
ALARM COMPANY How're we doing, Mr. Why-Teeng? It's secure. He tries another one. It's secure. 
WHITING

WHITING (CONT'D) 
(INTO PHONE) The sliding door is unlocked. He turns slowly. The room looks different. There is an alcove with a wet-bar and walk-in closets. 
ALARM COMPANY Did you leave it unlocked? 
WHITING Send a car, you imbecile. He looks at the alcove and closet. Just then, the desk phone RINGS, startling him. The phone rings and rings. on the wall behind Whiting's head are beautifully framed photos with Kissinger, Clinton, King Fahd. Rack focus off Whiting and slowly ZOOM to...

BOB You were in Beirut in '84. 
WHITING I lost friends there as I'm sure you did. 
(BEAT) I got a peek at your file. You're a good man, one whose experience is narrow and deep. Your entire career you've been used and probably never even known what for. 
BOB I didn't used to need to know. A Grand Slam Breakfast is set in front of Bob. 
WHITING In this town, you're innocent until you're investigated. Bob looks up and squints at the waitress' name-tag. 
BOB Bacon looks perfect, Deborah. Bob puts syrup on the pancakes. Eats a piece of bacon. 
BOB (CONT'D) Innocent until investigated. That's nice. It has a nice ring to it. I bet you've worn some miles on little sayings like that. Very wise, gives the listener the sense of law being written as it's spoken.

BOB (CONT'D) If anything happens to me or my family, an accident, an accusation, anything, then first your son will disappear, his body will never be found. Then your wife. Her body will never be found either. This is guaranteed. Then, whatever is the most dangerous thing you do in your life, it might be flying in a small plane, it might be walking to the bank, you will be killed. 
(BEAT) Do you understand what I'm saying? I want you to acknowledge that you do understand so that we're clear and there won't be any mistakes. After a beat, Whiting nods. 
WHITING Beirut rules, Mr. Baer? Whiting loves the game. Bob looks tired, maybe a little sad. 
BOB I've made decisions that resulted in deaths, but I never lost a nights sleep. Never. I killed people, but I always had about 500 pages of U.S. law behind me, law that I believed in, and that was good enough. 
WHITING You still do, Mr. Baer. You still do. Bob stares at him. 
BOB I want my passports back.

Tight on Bennett as he runs through a downtrodden neighborhood. Sweat dripping, breathing heavily, he runs faster and faster. People on stoops watch him go.

148 CONTINUED: 148 
JIMMY POPE We use one quarter of the oil in the world, Bennett. Your house is light and warm and my house is light and warm, but what if it was that way half the week, or none of the week. Hell, China's economy ain't growing as fast as it could because they can't get all the oil they need. I'm damn proud of that fact. Bennett gives him nothing. A beat. 
JIMMY POPE (CONT'D) What if it involved someone at your firm? Someone way the hell above you. We'd have to have an understanding. 
BENNETT If he's as big as you say then when he goes down the merger will be approved. Despite himself, Jimmy is impressed -- 
JIMMY POPE Just like that.

SUICIDE BOMBER (ON VIDEO) I wish for everyone who hears this to fear God and to follow God and his prophets. When I die I want the people who inherit my possessions to do the following: A group of twenty or thirty BOYS, including Wasim and Farooq, watch the video in a makeshift shed. 
SUICIDE BOMBER (VIDEO) (CONT'D) One: the people who prepare my body should be good Muslims so this will remind me of God and his forgiveness. Two: I don't want anyone to rip their clothes or slap their faces because this is an ignorant thing to do. Mohammed Sheik Agiza watches the boys watch the video. 
MOHAMMED SHEIK AGIZA His influence on those left behind grows. There is no sense of loss, since he continues to live and inspire, his fame spreading. Wasim impassively stares at the video. 
SUICIDE BOMBER Three: I don't want a pregnant woman to come and say good bye to me because I don't approve it. 
153 EXT. THE BEES - DAY 153

WASIM (CONT'D) 
(SOFTLY) If I truly lack faith, then I am not the right person. He looks to Farooq who seems very young at this moment. 
FAROOQ The questioning means that you have faith and makes it stronger 
WASIM That's a lot of shit, I think. Farooq looks around to see if anyone is listening. 
FAROOQ We'll get to intervene in the affairs of family members. We'll be able to help them with whatever they need.

BRYAN I don't see you moving to Colorado. 
155 INT. BEDOUIN TENT - DAY 155 
The tent is crowded with tribal and military leaders. Worried and suspicious, they.sit on rugs and recline against pillows. Nasir enters and takes his seat. 
PRINCE NASIR For centuries Islam has been ruled by people with no respect for law, monopolies handed out for the things that people want, commerce stifled, young people unable to find jobs, critics jailed or put to death, women are second-class 
CITIZENS -- He is interrupted by a BEDOUIN LEADER. 
BEDOUIN LEADER Tomorrow is the coronation. Your brother has the support of the United States. And 10,000 of their troops are stationed in our country. 
PRINCE NASIR This is true. My father is ill and weak and unwilling to fight the Americans. But others are willing. And when a country has five percent of the world's population but does fifty percent of its military spending, then the persuasive powers of that country are on the decline. The crowd is unmoved. Rallying the men will not be easy. 
FRANKS Great. He eats some chips, offers some to another guy. 
FRANKS (CONT'D) Is it night there still? 
WILLY Morning. 
CUT TO: 
164 EXT. BEDOUIN TENT - MORNING 164 
The tribal leaders have bargained through the night. Outside the tents EVERYONE ELSE is waiting, including Bryan whose ear piece dangles to his Blackberry. 
BRYAN (INTO PHONE) 
(NOT EXCITED) We have a contract to establish a new petroleum exchange. No firm our size has pulled off anything like this. Bryan crosses to the CHINESE OIL EXECUTIVES. 
BRYAN (CONT'D) He's a visionary, like Faisal or Attaturk, and the people love him. By Monday, he'll be running the country. The Chinese seem unconvinced. Finally, the tent opens and the leaders file out. Prince Nasir addresses the crowd. 
PRINCE NASIR The Middle-East and the Arab people have seen empires come and go in six millennia. The Pax Romana, the Pax Ottomanica, the Pax Brittanica, were nothing more than invasions and occupations that ended... The Pax Americana will end, too. His wife and daughters proudly watch. 
PRINCE NASIR (CONT'D) We have endless patience for history, but a man starving to death while sitting on a chair made of gold can no longer afford to be patient. The time for democratic, Arab self- determination has arrived. The crowd CHEERS. And as Prince Nasir, his family and supporters move toward the vehicles, find Nasir's BODYGUARD whispering into a cell phone -- 
BODYGUARD Silver Hummer -- 
(CONTINUED)

The Liquefied Natural Gas facility has changed hands. The CHINA GAS AND ELECTRIC signage is now CONNEX-KILLEEN signage. The Chinese engineers are now American engineers. Native MUSICIANS entertain a small crowd of HARD HATS, local OFFICIALS and visiting DIGNITARIES. Someone BREAKS A BOTTLE across a huge colored pipe. The CHIEF ENGINEER signals. He throws a huge lever -- A POWERFUL WHISPER builds, hurtling through the pipes toward them and past them to the LNG CARRIER, a thousand- foot-long tanker, docked alongside.

The doors open. Sydneyand Bennettenter, wearing tuxedos. Sydney insertsa plasticcard allowing accessto the upper floors. 
SYDNEY His wife'll be there. Pat. Butter wouldn't melt in her mouth. The elevator TONES on every floor. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) This is good. You done good. The watch the floors light up. 
167 INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT 167 
The door opens and PAT JANUS, 50's, Nancy Reagan suit and coif, opens the door. She takes in the men, smiling -- 
MRS. JANUS Sydney, how are you? And you must be Mr. Holiday? she shakes his hand. Gives Sydney both cheeks. They cross the large suite, one wall of which is floor-to-ceiling windows giving a dazzling view of mid-town Manhattan. 
(CONTINUED) 
167 CONTINUED: 167 In a sitting area, LELAND "LEE" JANUS, 60's, a vigorous pit-bull in tux shirt and bow-tie, turns from the TV -- 
MR. JANUS Syd! Bennett! Lee Janus! How're we doing? Janus is standing with his hand out -- 
MR. JANUS (CONT'D) Those number crunchers can get a little over-zealous, can't they, but Christ, when we write the GAAP rules like some kind of abstract painting. Stare at that liability hard enough and before long it'll turn into an asset. 
CUT TO: 
168 INT. CIA - TASK FORCE ROOM - NIGHT 168 
A small black and white image of a room full of GENERALS and SUPPORT STAFF moving silently around. PULLING back to reveal they're on a small monitor, titled, "US CENTRAL COMMAND, TAMPA, FLORIDA." The Division Chief, Franks, other Group Chiefs huddle over another, blank, MONITOR. ANGLE: ON THE BLANK MONITOR, suddenly, an image pops on -- desert seen from seven miles up. A wide shot of sand and more sand. The room lets out soft YEAHS as the image shifts, finding a distant highway cutting through it. 
WILLY (V.0.) Image from Predator. Seven miles up. Let's go in. God, I love the UAV's. 
FRED FRANKS (V.0.) What? 
WILLY Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. I love 'em. 
FRED FRANKS And it's quiet, right?

CUT TO: 
177 INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - NIGHT 177 
Sydney on his feet, standing aggressively over Bennett. 
SYDNEY In our line of work, the guy with the documents is usually the guy who stole the documents. 
BENNETT Finesse. Strategize. Advise. But don't own. Your words. 
SYDNEY You aren't going to hurt me, Bennett. You'll wash out of the private sector. Fact, you're already gone. You'll end up working public defender cases. You'll make 1/50th the money. You could have been on the boards of Fortune Five Hundred companies. You could have been an advisor to Presidents. You could have helped us win like Romans instead of sitting on the sidelines hoping we don't turn into Visigoths. 
(BEAT) You jumped that turnstile, sir, but don't worry, we'll get you off at trial -- Sydney takes the documents out of Bennett's hands. 
SYDNEY (CONT'D) 
(CALMING) We expect you kids to try and kill the father. We encourage it. Just maybe not so soon. Sydney senses something and sees DONALD FARISH III and FBI AGENTS have entered the room. Sydney turns back to Bennett, a flash of true venom -- 
SYDNEY (CONT'D)' You ungrateful, pissant, nobody. FBI restrains Sydney. Pat looks up from her needlepoint. 
(CONTINUED) 
177 CONTINUED: 177 
BENNETT A piece of advice Syd, one attorney to another... Bennett leans close -- 
BENNETT (CONT'D) 
(SOTTO) Get rid of that watch. It makes you look like a nigger. ANGLE - on Sydney's wrist is the Mickey Mouse watch. And then a handcuff is slipped over it and clicked tight. Sydney now appears completely relaxed again. He looks at Donald Farish III and nods -- 
SYDNEY Don. Not the perp walk, Don -- Farish nods as if to acknowledge they're barely out of round one. And they begin leading Sydney out. Across the room, silhouetted by the windows, Mrs. Janus helps Mr. Janus slip on his tux jacket. They see Bennett standing awkwardly in the middle of the room. Pat extends her hand for him to join them. 
178 EXT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE BALCONY - EVENING 178 
The three are silhouetted against the skyline. Mr. Janus looks out at the valleys of Manhattan. 
MR. JANUS I'm a straight shooter, Bennett. I think it was Trollope who said the best capitalist is someone who's greedy and honest. We can't forget that second part. 
MRS. JANUS It was Trollope, honey. 
MR. JANUS We're creating a lot of jobs this quarter, Bennett, a lot of jobs. We're building a business and that's what America's all about.

ON THE MONITOR the convoy is in the smudge of sheep. 
WILLY (O.S.) Silver Hummer, silver Hummer where are you silver Hummer? ON THE MONITOR the image tightens, zooming in on the silver roof of Nasir's Hummer. It locks -- Relief on the faces of Bureau Chiefs and technicians. 
WILLY (CONT'D) There's a phrase. You know what I mean. What's the phrase? Target

Fire boats shoot water in the distance. As Wasim makes his way to the prow of the boat, slowly. the huge LNG tanker slides into frame, filling the sky. The name -- THE CONDOLEEZA RICE -- appears. Wasim pushes fishing nets aside, revealing a stinger missile fashioned into a shaped charge and fitted to the prow of the boat. 
A SMILEY FACE scratched into the surface of the Stinger, the same missile Bob intended to explode in the beginning.

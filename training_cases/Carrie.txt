CARRIE 
Written by 
Lawrence D. Cohen & Stephen King 
FADE IN: 
From an absolutely glistening WHITE ­ an image which first appears to be a brilliantly shining glass globe, and then gradually becomes more of a piece of solid matter, less of a mystery. It's the 
EXT. WHITE BUNGALOW (OR HOUSE) ­ DAY 
1. FILLING THE FRAME like a picture postcard. Modest, old-fashioned, spotless ­ a vision of small town normalcy and virtue. 
This is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. It seems to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white. Even the lawn seems to have been washed and bleached. Antiseptic. 
We hear a woman's voice: 
MARGARET (o.s.) Carrie! Carrie 
The voice is distant but insistent. It is heard, in perspective, through the following prologue, which initially involves: 
2. STELLA HORAN ­ DAY 
An all-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun. 
The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body ­ luxuriant, taking it in inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard. 
3. DOWNWARDS ANGLE ­ STELLA 
As she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half- grown hedge which separates the Horan back yard from the White house next door. 
VOICE (O.S.) What are those? 
4. STELLA'S POV ­ CARRIE WHITE 
A terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde- white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella through the hedge. 
STELLA Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright. (turning down the radio) How long have you been there? 
CARRIE (not smiling; pointing with her finger) What are those? 
Stella looks where Carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing her breasts ­ white against the golden tan. Stella adjusts her suit ­ not out of any particular modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely. 
STELLA Those are my breasts, honey. 
CARRIE (a beat; then solemnly) I wish I had some. 
STELLA You will. `Course you'll have to wait a couple of years, but ­ 
CARRIE (a fact) No I won't. 
STELLA Why, sure you will. 
CARRIE (emphatic) No, I won't. (glancing behind her) Momma says no... Momma says good girls don't. 
STELLA (at something of a loss) Well, I'm a good girl. And besides, doesn't your mother have breasts? 
5    CARRIE Glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White house next door. She swallows her words so that all Stella and we hear is: 
CARRIE ...dirtypillows. 
STELLA What? 
CARRIE Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them `cuz she was bad when she made me. 
6   STELLA 
Incredulous. But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she too glances warily over at the White house just beyond the half-grown hedge. 
She kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off. 
STELLA Now, honey, that's just silly. Listen ­ you must be real hot in that long dress. What do you say we go inside and get us some lemonade, would you like that? 
7   CARRIE 
Clearly torn ­ tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror ­ as if she expected the earth to open and swallow her up. She shakes her head. 
STELLA C'mon. (offering her hand) It'll be our secret. 
Carrie ­ now really scared ­ shakes her head and disappears farther into the hedge. 
CARRIE I can't! 
STELLA Sure you can. I make it nice and sweet, and ­ 
And just at that moment, a figure appears in the second-story window in the White house. Although Stella and we really can't distinctly see through the sun's glare, it's unmistakably MARGARET WHITE. The moment this big woman sees her daughter with Stella, she lets out a bloodcurdling scream: 
MARGARET CAARRIEETTAAA!!! 
8 CARRIE, STELLA Both frozen by this terrible sound 
9 STELLA'S POV ­ CLOSER ON CARRIE 
As she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as if she might faints. She looks quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, she seems to smile ­ or is she about to cry? 
And then, she's gone ­ running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the White house as fast her legs can carry her. 
21 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE ­ MORNING 
Now some years later ­ and no longer glistening so whitely or mysteriously. We see the front of the house as the door flies open. Carrie, now sixteen or seventeen, appears in the doorway, carrying school books. As she comes out on the porch, the screen door bangs behind her. 
She is wearing a shapeless, drab dress ­ much too long, not so much out of style as utterly without style. What remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the pretty child we glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable eyes. 
As she comes down the porch stairs, we hear: 
MARGARET'S VOICE Carrie! 
Carrie stops, turns to reply into the house. 
CARRIE Yes, Momma. 
MARGARET'S VOICE You come straight home from school. 
A moment of hesitation on Carrie's part, a very slight hint of rebellion, but: 
CARRIE (sweetly) I always do, Momma. 
Then she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, quickening. 
22. EXT WHITE HOUSE ­ ANOTHER ANGLE 
As Carrie walks down the path from the porch and turns at the sidewalk, in the course of which she passes by where the Horans used to live. Only the Horans no longer live here. No one does. It's a vacant lot with a FOR SALE sign out front, with overgrown weeds. From the looks of them, the house vanished a long time ago. 
23 EXT. TOWN STREETS ­ DAY 
Carrie is walking to school, the sun shining brightly above her. The farther she gets from her house, the livelier she seems. We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out, an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest. And to help persuade us about this possibility, there is MUSIC. 
24 BOBBY ERBETER 
About five, BOBBY bikes on the other side of one of the streets, keeping pace with Carrie on a twenty-inch Schwinn with training wheels. 
BOBBY Hey, fart-face! Hey, old praying Carrie! Praying, Carrie, praying Carrie, praying Carrie! 
Carrie favors him with a sweet tolerant smile and goes on toward the high school, in the background: 
Bobby, frustrated, stops astride is bike and screams after her. 
Bobby's face ­ 
DISSOLVE TO: 
25 THE FACE OF AN ADOLESCENT 
Or as he is known in school, THE BEAK. He is pathetically thin, myopic, weak-chinned, beak-nosed, almost a caricature of an adolescent reject. Over his face, we HEAR: 
FROMM'S VOICE What are you going to leave for us, You people in your big cars Spewing pollution into the air? 
We PAN the faces of adolescents, listening with various degrees of attention, indifference, or reluctance, to: 
FROMM'S VOICE You people with heavy feet Trampling down the wilderness? You people who peer into the back seats of our cars Hours after you come out of the back doors of your motels. Soon all we will have is each other, and that could be enough... 
26 INT. CLASSROOM ­ FROMM ­ DAY 
Or, as he is known to his pupils, BIG BELLY FROMM, at his desk in front of the class, reading from an assignment paper. 
FROMM ...If you will let us have room enough And air enough And peace enough To love each other As you never could 
He sets down the paper, and looks at the class. 
27 FROMM'S POV ­ THE CLASS 
We will see, among others, Carrie. 
We also see TOMMY ROSS ­ a mid-seventies version of the boy next door. Good-looking, clean-cut, intelligent, athletic. 
28 FROMM 
He is nodding his head slowly, affecting a kind of puzzlement. 
FROMM I must say ­ I must confess ­ this poem displays an extraordinary talent... (the knife) ...a talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross. 
29 THE CLASS 
All eyes are on Tommy, who doesn't seem very abashed. In fact, he turns, clasps his hands over his head, to the delight of his classmates. But you don't get the feeling he is a goof-off; he is a kid aware of his own popularity and comfortable with it. 
30 FROMM 
FROMM Tommy, this is slightly different from running for a touchdown... Any criticisms? 
31 THE CLASS 
The usual hesitation. Then Carrie's hand shoots up. 
32 FROMM 
He appears surprised to see Carrie, ordinarily shy, volunteering. 
FROMM Carrie White? 
33 THE CLASS ­ FEATURING CARRIE 
Her volunteering has surprised her as well. But she's stuck with it. The eyes of the class are on her. And she has to say something. So she does. 
CARRIE It's... beautiful. 
Shrieks of laughter. Another tampon strikes Carrie. Another. The girls are bombarding her with tampons and sanitary napkins, some from purses, some from the broken dispenser on the wall. As they bombard Carrie: 
GIRLS Plug it up, plug it up, plug it up, plug it up.... 
We isolate Sue Snell at the moment she joins in the chant, and watch her beginning to be caught up in what can only be described as a fury. 
Carrie howls and begins to back away, howling louder and louder. 
The door is flung open by Collins. 
COLLINS 
What is this? 
And she takes it in. She jerks the whistle to her mouth, blows and blows! The sound is louder than a shriek (which it resembles) or a howl (which it doesn't). 
And there is sudden silence. 
COLLINS (to girls) Get out! Get out! 
The girls retreat, Sue last. 
SUE It must be her first... 
COLLINS Out! 
As the girls slip out, Collins turns to Carrie, who has backed up and is whimpering. Collins slaps her face, not too hard at first, then with a flash of anger. 
CARRIE M... M... Miss Collins... 
COLLINS Stand up. Take care of yourself. 
CARRIE I'm bleeding. 
One blind searching hand comes up, clutches Collins' white shorts, leaving a bloody handprint. 
COLLINS Damn you! 
She hurls Carrie part way across the room toward the broken sanitary napkin dispenser. 
COLLINS Get over there! And take one! 
CARRIE 
I don't know... 
COLLINS Never mind the coin slot... It's broken. 
CARRIE It hurts... my stomach... 
COLLINS (grabbing her) Do it! Now. 
CARRIE I can't. I don't know how! 
There's a bright flash as a light BULB POIPS, fizzling out. Collins is surprised. 
COLLINS What...? 
And she looks at Carrie. Her anger seems to seep away. Her voice softens. 
COLLINS Carrie, don't you know...? (shakes her head, realizing and wondering) You don't. (reaches for Carrie) I'll show you. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
38A INSERT INT WAITING ROOM ­ DAY CARRIE AND MISS FINCH 
38 INT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE ­ DAY 
HENRY MORTON, the principal, a decent but somewhat plodding man in his mid-forties, is tapping out his pipe as he talks to Collins. 
MORTON Isn't she a bit old for her... 
Well, he can't quite say it. 
COLLINS 
Her first period? 
MORTON Ah, yes. 
COLLINS Morty, until a half hour ago, I don't think she knew there was such a thing. 
He hesitates a moment ­ noticing Carrie's bloody handprint on Collins' gym shorts. 
MORTON It's hard to believe in this day and age a girl in high school wouldn't know... something... the facts. 
COLLINS Well, knowing that mother of hers... 
MORTON (cutting her off) Miss Collins, if you'd been with us longer, you'd understand we cannot interfere with people's beliefs. As for the girls ­ 
COLLINS Carrie's always been their scapegoat. So they... 
MORTON You'll have to do something. 
COLLINS I will. But I understood how those girls felt. The whole thing just made me want to take the girl and shake her. 
MORTON Ummm. 
TOMMY Hey. 
She turns away. 
TOMMY Hey, what's the matter? 
He puts his arm around her clumsily. 
SUE Nothing. 
TOMMY What did I do? 
SUE Nothing. It's not you. 
TOMMY Hey, everything's all right. I love you, honey. (silence) Did I...? 
SUE (blurting) It's Carrie. 
TOMMY Who? 
SUE Carrie. Carrie White. 
TOMMY Praying Carrie? 
SUE (sharply) Don't call her that. 
TOMMY (imitating Carrie) It's... beautiful. (laughing) That's what she said when I read that poem you wrote for me. 
SUE Tommy, please... 
TOMMY (going on) And Big Belly Fromm saying... (imitating) That isn't exactly criticism, Miss White. (exploding) Jesus! 
Sue has turned away from him. 
TOMMY Hey, honey, it was a beautiful poem. I wish I could have written it. (silence) Honey? 
SUE Don't call me that. 
TOMMY Don't call her that. Don't call me that. What the hell's the matter with you? 
She is crying, that's what. 
TOMMY Hey, are you crying? (yes, stupid) Are you? 
He tries to turn her toward him. She struggles. Manfully, he forces her around. 
TOMMY Jesus, Sue, what is it? 
SUE (trying to turn away) I told you. 
TOMMY Told me what? 
SUE 
About Carrie. 
TOMMY That thing in the shower? (she's silent) Hey, it was a joke, wasn't it? I mean, everyone was doing it. 
SUE I'm not everyone. 
TOMMY You're special. 
SUE I was one of them. 
TOMMY So you were teasing Carrie White ­ 
SUE We were hurting her ­ 
TOMMY She's used to it. Jesus, you remember how she'd get down on her knees and say grace in the cafeteria... alone, for Christ's sake. And the way she dresses... Hey, Sue, she's asking for it. 
SUE (vehemently) How would you like to be Carrie White? 
TOMMY How would I like to be Carrie White? 
SUE How would you like to be Carrie White? How would you like to be Carrie White instead of being Tommy Ross... big man, big jock, popular. 
TOMMY What's the big deal about being popular? I mean, one day I'll wake up and find myself working at my dad's car lot and out Friday nights and Saturdays at Uncle Billy's or the Cavalier drinking beer and maybe married with a bunch of kids... (stops) What's that got to do with Carrie White? Or anything? 
SUE I did something wrong and I feel bad about it. 
TOMMY I can understand that. Hey, back in seventh grade, there was this kid... 
SUE (interrupting) I've got to do something about it. 
TOMMY Like what? 
SUE I don't know yet. Apologize. 
TOMMY Okay, you tell her you're sorry. 
SUE That's not enough. That's like something my mom would do. 
TOMMY What are you going to do? Kiss her, for God's sake? 
SUE God, I hate you sometimes! 
TOMMY What the hell do you want me to do? 
Where Carrie is kneeling by her bed, now in her flannel nightgown, praying. 
MARGARET What was that noise? 
CARRIE 
Nothing, Momma. 
Margaret peers around the room; she did hear a mirror break, no mistake about it. But there it is ­ whole again as her reflection in it testifies. Margaret walks over to it, rearranges the plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child on the dresser. 
MARGARET Go to bed. 
She leaves the doorway and we return to Carrie, who smiles sweetly. And then: 
Flex. 
The door slams closed. 
100 INT. THE GYM ­ TRACKING SHOT ­ DAY 
Down the class of twenty-five or so girls, still in their street clothes, lined up against the gym wall under their class numbers as: 
101 COLLINS 
Walks in front of them with a clipboard taking roll. 
Collins ...Shyres... 
SHYRES (o.s.) Present 
COLLINS ...Snell... 
102 THE GIRLS 
STILL TRACKING, FEATURING Sue 
SUE Here. 
COLLINS (o.s.) Watson... 
WATSON Present. 
The CAMERA COMES to an empty space ­ without being told, we can tell it's Carrie's. 
103 COLLINS 
Hesitates, then moves right along. 
COLLINS ...and the Wilsons. 
Who're identical twins. 
CORA Here... 
RHONDA ...Miss Collins. 
COLLINS (small smile; then, closing her book) Okay. Sit down. 
All the girls ­ except Chris ­ obey. 
COLLINS You too, Chris. And spit out that gum. 
CHRIS (overly sweet) Where'll I put it, Miss Collins? 
COLLINS You can choke on it for all I care. Now sit down. 
104 CHRIS 
Pausing for a second, then deciding it's better to go along without talking back. She sits down. 
105 THE GIRLS 
Shifting nervously, unused to Collins' absolute no-nonsense tone. 
106 COLLINS 
Taking a deep breath. 
COLLINS Okay. I just want you all to know that you did a shitty thing yesterday. A really shitty thing. 
107 HELEN SHYRES 
the freckled, slightly pudgy girl sitting next to Sue ­ giggles nervously. But no one joins her, and she clasps her hand over her mouth, trying to stifle it. 
108 COLLINS 
Glaring at Helen, silencing her. 
COLLINS Did any of you stop to think that Carrie White has feelings? Do any of you ever stop to think? No, I guess you've got your minds on your dates and the Prom. Chris, I imagine you can take your pick, who's the lucky guy? 
CHRIS (mumbling) Billy Nolan. 
COLLINS (loudly) Who? Speak up! I can't hear you. 
Chris tries to control her anger ­ is barely able to. 
CHRIS Billy Nolan 
Her mind struggling with the words on the card, pondering, thoughtful. Her heart starts to beat. 
122 INT. THE GYM ­ TRACKING SHOT 
On the girls, all of them in the green gym suits, being run ragged, just as Collins promised. She's pushing them extremely hard, barking orders at them, using her whistle like a drill instructor. 
123 ANGLE ­ ON CHRIS 
As she runs to position herself next to Sue. 
CHRIS She can't get away with this. I'm going to get her. That goddamn snerd ­ 
SUE Let it go, Chris. 
And Sue runs on, leaving Chris ­ red in the face, breathless, furious ­ behind. Chris deliberately slows down and then just halts. 
COLLINS The period's not up, Hargensen. 
CHRIS It is for me. 
COLLINS There are ten minutes left. 
CHRIS Stick them up your ass. 
Chris starts to stalk past Collins who reaches out and firmly pushes her back. Chris becomes immediately hysterical. 
CHRIS You can't hit us! You'll get canned for this, you bitch! My father ­ 
COLLINS One more word from you and I'll throw you across the room. Want to see if I'm telling the truth? 
124 GROUP SHOT ­ FEATURING CHRIS 
Appealing to the others now; flailing, out of control. 
CHRIS She can't get away with this! Goddammit! If we all stick together, we can ­ 
125 THE GIRLS 
As Chris looks to them for support, none of them quite knowing what to do. 
CHRIS Norma... Helen... Sue! 
126 ANOTHER ANGLE 
Featuring Chris and Sue 
SUE (lifeless) Shut up, Chris. Just shut up. 
127 CHRIS 
A mutineer without a single ally now. She realizes it and heads for the door leading to the locker room, and this time, Collins doesn't even try to stop her. At the door: 
CHRIS This isn't over. This isn't over by a long shot. 
The door slams shut, leaving the girls and Collins frozen by Chris's outburst. The BELL gives a shrill RING, and we: 
CUT TO: 
128 INT. THE CAVALIER ­ AFTERNOON 
The local after-school hangout. Clusters of students milling in and around booths. Pinball machines, a jukebox thumping "NO WHERE TO RUN" by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. 
Sue is sitting, reading, alone in one of the booths as Chris enters, says hello to some of her clique, and spots her. 
CHRIS Hey, Sue! Just who I've been looking for! 
Sue looks up and tries to force her face into a smile. Chris slides into the booth across from her and thrusts her John F. Kennedy school yearbook across the table ­ an action which Sue involuntarily jerks away from out of nervousness. 
CHRIS (continuing) I wanted you to sign my yearbook. Hey, where's you old man, did he stand you up? 
SUE (busying herself with the yearbook) Still at practice 
CHRIS Well, I guess you've heard I'm out of the prom. I bet that cocksucker Morton loses his job, though. Daddy's suing them. Hey, Billee! Billee! Come over and say hi to Sue. 
Sue slides the yearbook back across the table to Chris, who examines it: 
CHRIS (continuing) Hey, is that it? Just Sue Snell? 
Billy goons INTO FRAME next to Chris, glomming his arm around her neck. 
BILLY Hey, Suze. 
CHRIS I think we're going anyway, right, Billee? 
BILLY Sure thing, Charlie. 
Chris playfully jabs him in the ribs. 
SUE You mean crash? 
CHRIS Sure, why not? Hey, listen, I've got a good one. "Roses are red, violets are blue, sugar is sweet, but Carrie White eats shit." 
Billy, goon that he is, cracks up. 
Sue finds it not at all funny, but doesn't know exactly what to do about what she's feeling. 
SUE Chris, I've got to go. 
As Collins tidies up after one of the classes ­ throwing towels into huge cans, etc. Only to hear a mewing, whimpering sound and come upon Carrie who's huddled in one of the dark corners of the room, crying. It's almost as if she created her own closet of space. 
COLLINS Carrie? (on no response) Carrie, what's the matter? (on still no response) Was it one of the girls? Did one of the girls do something to you? Do you want a Kleenex? 
CARRIE No. 
COLLINS It's all right. Just tell me, there's nothing to be afraid of. 
CARRIE Miss Collins... 
COLLINS That's it... 
CARRIE When can I come back to gym? 
COLLINS Not until Monday. Now what is it? Are you going to tell me? Come on, Carrie, tell me. 
CARRIE I got asked to the prom. 
COLLINS That's great! 
CARRIE Tommy Ross asked me. 
COLLINS Tommy Ross ­ that's wonderful. He's cute. 
CARRIE I know who he goes around with. They're trying to trick me again. I know. 
COLLINS Maybe he really meant it. I mean, maybe he really did mean it. Maybe you should think about it. It might be really fun. You might have a really good time! 
CARRIE It would be a nightmare. 
COLLINS C'mon, Carrie. You should have a better image of yourself. You just think you're unattractive, but look at your hair. It's really beautiful. If you just fixed it up a little... here, I'll show you. 
CUT TO: 
143 OMIT 
144 INT. FACULTY LOUNGE ­ DAY 
where Collins and Morton are grabbing a quick cup of coffee. 
COLLINS Carrie's been asked to the prom. 
MORTON Who? 
COLLINS Carrie White. 
MORTON By whom? The Beak? 
COLLINS By Tommy Ross. 
Morton goes into a coughing fit, accidentally knocking over his coffee in the process. Collins watches, slightly amused by his reaction. When he recovers: 
MORTON What about his girlfriend? Doesn't he date the little Snell girl? 
COLLINS I think she put him up to it. 
145 INT. OFFICE ­ DAY 
Where Collins is grilling a very nervous Sue ­ just Sue so far. 
COLLINS Who's brainstorm was this? (no response) What are you trying to do? 
SUE You've got it wrong. 
COLLINS I hope so. I wouldn't have expected this from you, Sue. Not any of it. Well? 
SUE What do you want to know? 
COLLINS Why Tommy asked her to the prom. (after a beat) Well? 
SUE (reluctant; able to go this far) I asked him to. 
COLLINS Why? 
SUE (swallowing) I asked him to. 
COLLINS But, in God's name, what for? What could you possibly have in mind? 
146 DIFFERENT ANGLE ­ FEATURING TOMMY 
Who's also in the office for this interrogation ­ ill at ease, trying to appear cool. 
SUE You mean what good would it do? Maybe it'll... bring her out of... make her a... 
COLLINS A part of things? Oh, come on, Sue. None of us are that stupid. And neither is Carrie. 
SUE Maybe not. 
COLLINS And you're not going to go? You're going to stay home and miss your senior prom? 
Just as this point, NORMA WATSON ­ a prissy little pleaser with a mouth whose verbal discretion could make the telephone obsolete ­ enters the room with a sheaf of attendance sheets for the next week. All conversation ceases. 
COLLINS (continuing) Yes, Norma? What is it? 
NORMA Just the attendance sheets, Miss Collins. 
COLLINS Just leave them on the desk. (to Sue) You understand, you can't come without a date? 
CARRIE You better go. 
MARGARET'S VOICE Carrie! Who are you talking to? 
TOMMY Don't you think you better answer? 
CARRIE No one, Momma. 
TOMMY You're going with me. 
CARRIE I can't. 
TOMMY You're going. 
CARRIE They'll laugh. 
TOMMY No one will laugh. We'll see to it. 
CARRIE Please. Please go. 
TOMMY Not `til you say yes. 
Carrie swipes at her eyes with the back of her hand; helpless, honest, confused. She'd really like to go at this point, but that extra sense in her is resisting. 
CARRIE Why? Why is it so important to you? 
TOMMY I don't know. Maybe it's because you liked my poem. 
MARGARET (o.s.) Carietta!!! 
And in just these split seconds, she decides; had he not "liked" her poem, had Margaret not called, perhaps she could have held back. 
CARRIE Yes. (beat) Okay. 
TOMMY I'll pick you up at eight. 
CARRIE (whispering) Fine. (then) Thank you. 
Tommy smiles at her and, turning to leave, touches her hand against the screen door. A goodbye, nothing more. He goes down the walk toward his car. 
149 CARRIE 
Watching him. She takes the hand he "touched" and brushes the hair back from her face. A little beautiful? You bet. 
MARGARET'S VOICE Carrie? Did you hear me? 
CARRIE Coming, Momma. Coming. 
And as she turns away from the door, we: 
CUT TO: 
150 INT. GYM ­ AFTERNOON 
SUE Why not? 
HELEN Why did you do it? God, everyone's talking. 
We PULL BACK to see the gym. The entire back wall has been devoted to a giant mural of stars and planets ­ it seems the prom is to have a celestial theme, and the gymnasium is in the process of being hung with a great deal of crepe paper, moons, etc. 
SUE I asked Tommy to take Carrie. I thought I owed her that much. 
HELEN Where does that put the rest of us? 
SUE You have to make up your own mind. 
HELEN And Tommy went along with it? 
SUE Uh-huh. (pauses) I guess the other kids think I'm stuck-up. 
HELEN Well... they're all talking about it. But most of them still think you're okay. 
151 HELEN'S POV ­ THE GYM ­ CHRIS AND NORMA WATSON 
as thick as thieves, off in the corner, whispering. 
152 TWO SHOT ­ SUE AND HELEN 
HELEN There is... (giggles) ...a small dissenting faction. 
SUE I guess she's having a field day with this. 
HELEN Susie, she hates your guts. 
Sue nods ­ she knew it, now she hears it. 
153 EXT. WHITE HOUSE ­ EVENING 
FULL FRONTAL VIEW of thee bungalow IN the FRAME. 
The lights are on downstairs; there's a slight drizzle and haze. HOLD, then: 
CUT TO: 
154 INT. WHITE KITCHEN 
As Carrie and Margaret finish dinner. Silence ­ punctuated only by the slight DRIZZLE outside and occasional flashes of THUNDER and lightning. Then: 
Carrie knits her brow, and flex, the window closes. 
Margaret whips around, facing Carrie. 
CARRIE I'm going, Momma. And things are going to change around here. 
Flex. 
The SOUND of a window shutting in another room. 
MARGARET Witch! 
Flex. 
Another window. 
MARGARET (continuing) It's Satan's power. First he entered your father, carried him off... 
CARRIE He ran away, Momma. Everyone knows that. 
Flex. 
A couple of windows. 
MARGARET The devil tempted him. 
CARRIE He ran away with a woman, Momma. 
MARGARET All men are the same. That boy, he's like all the rest, he doesn't ­ 
Flex. 
The rest of the windows in the house THUNDER shut. 
CARRIE I don't care. He asked me to go. And I'm going. I'm going, Momma. You can't stop me. 
HOLD ­ 
SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
155 & 156 OMITTED 
157 EXT. ROAD ­ NIGHT 
Leading to Henty's farm. A slight drizzle; or, the ground is still wet. A little more than a crescent moon silhouettes a group of five: Billy and Chris in front, and Billy's twitchy zoo ­ a completely wrecked KENNY GARSON, a very nervous FREDDY DE LOIS, and an occasionally giggling, goggled HENRY TRENNANT ­ trailing behind. De Lois is swinging a nine-pound sledge-hammer in the air; the other two goons are struggling with an ice-chest and steel pails. Henty's farmhouse and barn are in the distance. 
DE LOIS Hell of a risk for a joke. 
Trennant giggles inanely. Billy stops and glares at De Lois. 
BILLY You want out? 
DE LOIS (hastily) No, uh-uh. (then) It's a good joke, Billy. 
Trennant giggles again. 
Garson is stoned silly ­ zonked, deadpan. He greedily sucks the last remnants of a joint into oblivion before our eyes. 
De Lois angrily snatches the roach out of Garson's fingers. 
DE LOIS (continuing) Hey, piggie... 
Trennant just giggles inanely. 
Another long beat, then: 
DE LOIS (continuing) You sure Old Man Henty won't be around? 
CHRIS I told you. He's at a funeral. 
Trennant explodes into a fit of high-pitched laughter. 
BILLY Shut up, Henry. 
DE LOIS Whose funeral did he go to? 
BILLY His mother's. 
DE LOIS His mother's? Jesus Christ, she musta been older than God! 
Trennant lurches into another cackle. And in spite of themselves, Billy and Chris start laughing, too. Even De Lois starts laughing. 
The group passes a "No Trespassing" sign, prompting: 
DE LOIS (continuing) The bastard is going to shit where he stands when he comes back and gets a look. 
Garson drops one of the pails on the ground. 
BILLY Asshole. 
The sound of Trennant's high-pitched giggle. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
158 CHRIS'S POV ­ THE HOG PEN 
And OVERLAPS INTO the harmonic chanting of De Lois, Trennant and Garson: 
MARGARET There's going to be a judgement! 
There's nothing more to say. Carrie walks up to the stairs, and we: 
DISSOLVE TO: 
161 INT. GYMNASIUM ­ NIGHT 
Very dark, shadowy, deserted. The night before the prom. Silence, then a SCRAPING sound of a: 
162 WINDOW 
Being jimmied open. Behind the thick glass, we see a face ­ just whose isn't clear yet. The slip-lock comes free, the sill is being pushed up, and Billy's head appears. Chris is right behind him. 
163 LONG SHOT ­ THE GYM 
As a flashlight is shined upwards ­ at the criss-crossing girders sheathed in crepe paper; at banks of lights which will later be used to shine down and highlight two areas in particular ­ the huge wall mural and the chalked-in spot where the King and Queen of the Prom will be crowned. 
164 TWO SHOT ­ BILLY AND CHRIS 
DOLLYING right behind them as they proceed toward the stage area ­ past the numerous tables set up for the prom-goers, past the twin bandstands. Billy is carrying the ice chest, Chris the flashlight. 
165 ANOTHER ANGLE 
As they arrive behind the stage. Billy puts the chest down and takes out a pair of Playtex rubber gloves, snaps them on. Then he takes out two small pulleys and a coil of twine. 
166 CHRIS' POV ­ BILLY 
Looking somewhat like a bizarre mountaineer, climbing a ladder which takes him up to a narrow platform overlooking the stage area. 
167 CLOSEUP ­ CHRIS 
Shining the flashlight to guide Billy, her face flushed with excitement. 
168 BILLY 
As he disappears behind a short draw curtain which obscures the girders over the stage. 
169 CHRIS 
unable to see him, suddenly feeling very alone. 
CHRIS What's it like up there? (no response) Billee? (no answer; genuinely scared) Billy! 
And just at that moment, a piece of crepe paper floats into the FRAME and lands in Chris's hair. She jumps, utterly unnerved. She looks up to see Billy staring down at her from the platform, grinning. 
BILLY Boo. 
CHRIS You stupid shit. 
BILLY (still in good humor) Nice talk. 
CHRIS Hurry up. Do you hear me, just hurry up. 
BILLY (blackface) Yes'um. Yes'um. Weeze doing the best we can. 
CHRIS I want to go home. 
BILLY Just keep your tits on and I'll let you pull it when the time comes. 
CHRIS I plan to. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
170 A SERIES OF SCENES ­ LEADING TO THE PROM 
CUTTING between the final arrangements for the prom itself and Carrie's preparations as the night approaches. The emphasis is on these two paralleling elements, although this montage ­ scored throughout with happier and happier MUSIC ­ will also feature some of our lesser characters. 
Among other things, we will see: 
A) THE GYM ­ as last-minute arrangements are made ­ more crepe paper hung, party favors put on tables, etc.; 
B) CARRIE ­ in a town store as she shops for makeup; 
C) NORMA WATSON ­ under a hair dryer, her mouth going a mile a minute as a manicurist does her nails and looks utterly exhausted; 
D) TOMMY ­ picking out Carrie's corsage at the florist; 
E) CARRIE ­ at the sewing machine, finishing her dress (which we still don't see), a happy look on her face; 
F) THE GYM ­ as a bank of lights suddenly illuminate the mural on the stage wall; 
G) SUE ­ having dinner with her parents 
H) THE TWINS ­ in front of their dressing tables; both of them putting on enormous fake eyelashes simultaneously; 
I) ERNEST ­ the class president ­ making sure the microphone on the stage works; 
J) THE BAND ­ among them, The Beak, setting up; 
K) SANDRA STENCHFELD, practicing her fabulous twirling baton act; 
L) A DOOR ­ which opens to reveal the twins in their high heels, both of them several inches taller than their depressed-looking dates; 
M) GEORGE AND FRIEDA ­ he in his tuxedo, she in her prom dress; a flash as Freida's parents take a Polaroid of this night to remember; 
N) THE GYM ­ with the adult chaperones ­ teachers, administrators ­ standing around, looking for something to do. 
And she's gone, down the 
174 STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, TO THE FRONT DOOR ­ TRACKING 
Carrie who opens the door. 
175 ANGLE ON TOMMY 
Well, we know he's beautiful. And he's looking at Carrie. He didn't know: 
176 CARRIE ­ TOMMY'S POV 
He didn't know she could be beautiful. And she is. 
177 TOMMY AND CARRIE 
He reaches out his hand. 
TOMMY Hi. 
Carrie takes his hand. 
178 EXT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT 
Hand in hand, Carrie and Tommy walk down the path toward his car. 
They are observed by: 
179 MARGARET 
at the window of Carrie's room. 
180 INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT 
Margaret leaves the window as we HEAR Tommy's car drive off. 
She goes out of the room. 
181 TRACKING MARGARET 
Down the stairs, through the dining room, into the kitchen. Almost the same path that Carrie trod, but trod so differently. While Carrie's pace had been light, nervously expectant, Margaret's is slow and heavy. 
182 INT. WHITE KITCHEN ­ NIGHT 
Margaret crosses to one of the drawers. 
She reaches in and takes out a long carving knife; it gleams in the light. 
CUT TO: 
183 EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT ­ NIGHT 
The school gymnasium is lit up brightly for the Prom; cars are pulling in, among them, Tommy's Ford. 
184 INT. TOMMY'S CAR 
as Tommy turns off the ignition. Carrie's staring at the other couples getting out of their cars. Tommy watches her taking it all in. 
CARRIE It's like a dream. 
TOMMY You can still change your mind, you know. 
She turns to him and realizes he's teasing her. 
CARRIE Easier said than done. 
TOMMY (grinning) C'mon. 
CARRIE No. Please ­ not yet. 
TOMMY Scared? 
CARRIE Yes. (beat) Can we sit here another minute? 
Tommy laughs and nods. A moment of silence. Carrie is miserable ­ she's happy to be with Tommy, she's trying to have a good time, but it's hard. It's like getting up to dance the first time. Perhaps it would be better to sit this one out. 
CARRIE Tommy... (and then out it comes) Maybe... maybe this was a mistake. 
TOMMY Hey, it won't be so bad. 
She tries to smile at him. It's not very persuasive. 
TOMMY Really, I mean it. They're okay, you'll see. (beat; she's trying to believe him) Don't be nervous. Besides... (a little self-mocking) I'd look awfully silly dancing by myself. 
And that's just enough ­ he's taken her mind off her own fear just enough to make her laugh. 
CUT TO: 
185 INT. GYM 
where the prom is already under way, the band PLAYING an energetic version of "Harlem Nocturne." From Carrie's POV it's all magic ­ explosions of pastel color, everyone looking like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness. 
Carrie just stands at the double-doors which are the main entrance to the gym, taking it all in as Tommy hands their tickets to ushers at the door. As Carrie stares at the giant mural on the stage wall ­ full of celestial moon, stars and rockets ­ a VOICE bellows out behind her. 
VOICE Hey, Ross. Gawd, you look queer. 
186 GEORGE DAWSON 
COLLINS (gesturing to his seat) May I? 
Carrie nods, and she sits down, pulling the chair next to her. They're virtually alone at this moment; everyone else is dancing or occupied. 
COLLINS Carrie, anything that happened before... well, it's all forgotten. I want you to know that. 
CARRIE I can't forget it. (beat) But it's over with. It's over. 
Collins smiles; she looks at the dance floor and Carrie's eyes follow hers. At this particular moment, the band is PLAYING a quiet number ­ slow, romantic. 
COLLINS I remember my own prom. I was two inches taller than the boy I went with when I was in my heels. He gave me a corsage that clashed with my gown. But it was magic. I don't know why. But I've never had a date like it, ever since. Is it like that for you? 
CARRIE It's very... nice. 
COLLINS (smiling) Just nice? 
CARRIE No. There's more. I don't know... (hesitating; then) ...it's like being on Mars. 
COLLINS You'll never forget it. 
CARRIE I think you're right. 
And then, on sheer impulse, Carrie reaches out and hugs her, hugs her tightly. 
CARRIE Thank you. 
COLLINS Have a lovely time, Carrie. 
TOMMY (o.s.) Hey, what's going on here? 
There is Tommy, looking "stern." 
TOMMY (to Collins) What are you doing with my date? 
COLLINS Girl secrets. 
A smile at Carrie, and she goes off. 
TOMMY Don't let me catch you hugging any guys. 
CARRIE You won't. 
TOMMY Better not. Hey, listen, do you really have to be back so early? 
CARRIE I promised. 
TOMMY Okay. I understand. 
CARRIE I'm sorry. 
TOMMY No, it's okay. Listen, the other kids are going over to Lewiston after the Prom ­ 
CARRIE (breaking in) That's okay. 
TOMMY What is? 
CARRIE You want to go with your friends. I don't want to spoil anything... 
TOMMY Hey, let me finish. What I was going to say, I mean if it'd be alright with you, what do you say we go to the Cavalier? 
CARRIE (surprised; she'd love to) I've never been there. 
TOMMY Hey, great. We'll have the place all to ourselves. Great! (he means it) Then it's settled. 
He takes her arm, turns her toward the dance floor. 
CARRIE (holding back) Tommy... 
TOMMY C'mon... 
CARRIE I don't... I can't... I... 
TOMMY You can. 
He has his arms around her and half-spins, half tugs her out onto the floor. He is a young man of considerable confidence ­ the best part of his popularity ­ and it's a contagious trait. Gradually, Carrie gets caught up in the slow dancing, begins to follow him less and less awkwardly, begins to get less and less self-conscious, and, in short, starts to glide into her freedom. 
190 A CORNER OF THE GYM 
Tommy and Carrie dance into this corner; Carrie is a bit breathless and very happy. For some moments, Tommy keeps his arms around Carrie, looking at her. And then he leans forward, about to kiss her, impulsively. And impulsively and instinctively, she draws back. And is immediately embarrassed. 
TOMMY Hey... 
CARRIE I'm sorry. 
TOMMY I... 
CARRIE It's just... 
TOMMY No harm, no foul. 
They stand there for a couple of seconds. 
And suddenly and swiftly, Carrie kisses Tommy. It's a quick, awkward, frightened kiss. A bird peck. 
And again they stand there, until: 
CARRIE I don't know... anything. I can't dance... 
Carrie looks up at the stage ­ at the massive thrones all in white. 
CARRIE They're beautiful. 
TOMMY You're beautiful. 
Carrie meets his eyes and blushes; it's all overwhelming her, and she has to look away ­ at the tiny party favor boat on the table in front of her, at the tiny pencil next to it. 
CARRIE Who do we vote for? They're more your crowd than mine. 
TOMMY Whatever you like. 
CARRIE In fact, I don't really have a crowd. 
TOMMY Let's vote for ourselves. To the devil with false modesty. 
She laughs aloud ­ the sound of her own laughter is so foreign to her that she claps a hand over her mouth, at her own daring. She takes the pencil and quickly circles their names ­ so quickly that the pencil breaks, bringing a small drop of blood to her finger. She gasps. 
TOMMY Hurt yourself? 
CARRIE No. (trying to smile) But I broke it and it was a souvenir. 
TOMMY There's still your boat. (he pushes it gently toward her) Toot, toot. 
196 INT. SCHOOL ­ NIGHT 
as Sue ­ hardly in formal attire ­ stares through the same small window in the gym door that Carrie stared through earlier ­ she stares inside as: 
197 INT. GYM ­ STAGE AREA 
The ballots are being counted, Morton and Fish helping Ernest separate them into piles. We ought to notice either De Lois or Trennant hanging around the voting tables ­ perhaps Norma Watson as well. 
198 ANGLE ­ TOMMY AND CARRIE'S TABLE 
Carrie is holding Tommy's hand tightly ­ too tightly. 
TOMMY Hey, hey. 
CARRIE 
Sorry. 
TOMMY Don't know your own strength. Whew. 
He sees she's taking him seriously. Sensitive to her reaction, he smiles at her. 
TOMMY Hey, it's okay. 
In the background Josie and the Moonglows provide a flourish of drums. 
199 THE STAGE 
as Ernest walks up to the microphone and almost drops the ballots in the process. 
ERNEST We've sort of hit a snag. Mr. Morton says this is the first time in the history of the Spring Prom that ­ 
VOICE How far does he go back? 1800? 
LAUGHTER, CATCALLS. 
ERNEST We've got a tie. 
GEORGE Polka-dot or striped? 
ERNEST Sixty-three votes for Frank Grier and Cora Wilson, and sixty-three votes for Tommy Ross and Carrie White. 
Silence, then the APPLAUSE begins and starts to swell as we... 
CUT TO: 
200 TOMMY's POV ­ CARRIE 
An island in the APPLAUSE around her, her head lowered... 
201 TOMMY 
Watching her intently, his mouth slightly open... 
202 THE STAGE ­ ERNEST 
Vainly trying to speak over the APPLAUSE. 
ERNEST Attention! If I could have your attention, please... 
203 TOMMY AND CARRIE 
Tommy still staring at her. 
ERNEST (o.s.) We're going to have a run-off ballot. When you get yours, please write the couple you favor on it. 
204 CARRIE 
Slowly looking up, seeing Tommy. 
CARRIE They're not applauding for us. It can't be for us. 
TOMMY Maybe it's for you. 
Peering out farther to get a good look. Unseen at first by her, there's a cord on the edge of the FRAME. 
216 MORTON 
Blocked by the clamor of the students, he's unable to make a straight bee-line for Sue in the wings. So he takes the long way around ­ back behind the stage... 
217 TOMMY AND CARRIE 
Dollying as they're led down the center aisle; past a blur of smiling faces, the APPLAUSE SWELLING. They're being led toward the stage area ­ the thrones waiting for them. The lights get brighter; the MUSIC gets louder. 
218 THE BANDSTAND 
As they pass by. The Beak winds conspiratorially at Carrie. 
219 THE STAGE 
as Tommy gives Carrie his hand, helping her up the steps, over tangles of black power cables. 
220 BENEATH THE STAGE 
Where we finally reveal just where Chris and Billy have been hiding all this time. Chris listens to the footsteps (of Carrie and Tommy) coming overhead; grasping the cord that Billy has hooked up, holding it very tightly... 
221 CARRIE AND TOMMY 
as they're helped into the massive thrones; behind them is the huge mural of stars and ships. 
222 ERNEST 
the showman now, P.T. Barnum in all of his expansiveness. 
223 SUE 
In the wings, watching this action. In the corner of the FRAME, the cord we glimpsed earlier ­ the same one which Chris clutched beneath the stage ­ jiggles, and Sue notices it move. She traces its path with her eyes, seeing that it goes up to: 
224 A BANK OF LIGHTS 
Concealing a single silver bucket; meanwhile: 
225 CARRIE 
Staring down at the gym floor; the lights are searing ­ so hot and bright that it's impossible to see clearly, and a new set of spotlights being shone on Tommy and her only makes it harder. 
226 ANOTHER ANGLE ­ CARRIE 
as a piece of crepe paper lands in her hair... 
227 THE STUDENTS 
A sea of faces, the spectrum of reactions. 
228 ERNEST 
spreading his arms; a politician. 
ERNEST Ladies and gentlemen, I give you he King and Queen of the Spring Prom ­ TOMMY ROSS AND CARRIE WHITE! 
The Band starts playing the school SONG, and we... 
CUT TO: 
229 SUE IN THE WINGS 
The implications of the cord and bucket positioned over the throne just starting to dawn on her as everyone begins singing the school song: 
ALL (o.s.) All rise for the John F. Kennedy Hiyyyyh... 
And a hand comes into FRAME, clutching Sue's wrist. It belongs to: 
MORTON What're you doing here, young lady? 
SUE (trying to head for cord under stage) Something's wrong! 
ALL (o.s.) We'll raise your banner to the skyyyyh... 
But Morton has no interest in what Sue is trying to tell him: 
MORTON I'll say there is. 
230 ANOTHER ANGLE ­ CARRIE'S POV 
From the throne, she sees Sue ­ and Morton and he pulls her toward the back exit. 
231 BENEATH STAGE 
Chris is almost hyperventilating as the school song continues. 
BILLY What's the matter with you? Pull it! 
Chris is frozen ­ immobilized, terrified. 
232 CARRIE'S POV ­ SUE 
As Morton firmly pushes Sue out the rear gym door. The door shuts, and as it closes: 
233 CARRIE 
Confused, wondering what's happening in the glare of lights and noise... 
Through the harsh glare of the lights ­ laughing, pointing (see Norma Watson), doubling up in hysteria, utterly out of control. 
256 FACES, FACES, FACES 
Laughing... 
256A BILLY AND CHRIS 
reacting to their "success." 
257 CARRIE 
Putting her hands to her blood-covered face, slowly getting to her feet. 
258 THE STAGE 
As Carrie makes her way to the stairs, tripping over the black power cords. A horrified Collins is on her way up the stairs. 
COLLINS Oh, Carrie ­ let me help you. 
Carrie hesitates at the sight of the teacher. But it's too late for help, and in the fastest flex we've seen to date, she jerks her head and Collins bounces backward ­ down the stairs, slamming into a wall. 
259 THE STUDENTS 
Laughing harder now, unable to stop. 
260 THE GYM ­ ANOTHER ANGLE 
Where all is pandemonium. 
Morton makes his way to Collins, giving her his handkerchief; she has a bloody nose. 
COLLINS (to Morton) Call the police! 
261 CARRIE 
Tears streaming down her face, the blood streaking, as she takes in the sight of her tormentors. 
262 THE GYM ­ YET ANOTHER ANGLE 
Helen Shyres is still laughing so hard that she's about to throw up or go into shock. 
George Dawson has climbed on the stage and is hunched over the slumped figure of Tommy Ross, examining him. 
GEORGE Call a doctor! Hey, call a doctor, quick! 
He tries to pick Tommy up, and in the process the throne topples over on the stage. 
263 INT. HALL CORRIDORS ­ SUE 
Frantic, rushing back into the school and down the hall toward the prom doors. 
264 CARRIE 
Takes a deep breath, mustering her energy. She closes her eyes and sees: 
265 THE GYM DOORS ­ THREE SETS OF DOUBLE DOORS 
All of them open, a few students milling around them as... 
266 CARRIE 
Closes her eyes even tighter and flexes. And ­ in SWISH PANS: 
267 THE DOORS 
slam shut. In the process, several things are accomplished at once. The prom-goers are trapped inside, and one or two of them get their hands or legs caught in the doors as they close, screaming with surprise and pain. 
268 INT. HALL ­ SUE 
who once again was just a little late, arriving just as the DOORS SLAMMED SHUT; she sees the screaming prom-goers unlucky enough to have been caught in the doors. 
269 INT. GYM 
Utter pandemonium as students rush toward the doors. 
270 THE BEAK 
Near the bandstand area, looking up at the stage and realizing that it's Carrie who's responsible for closing the doors. 
THE BEAK It's Carrie! It's Carrie! 
Fromm starts heading toward the stage to get control of the microphone, to stop the panic. 
The kids continue rushing toward the closed doors. 
271 CARRIE 
A small smile at being recognized by the Beak as the one responsible, the one with the power now. It's not what she wanted, but it no longer matters. They're going to know her now and never forget her. 
272 CARRIE'S POV ­ GYM WALL 
Between two sets of double-doors, FEATURING a huge firehouse installed in case of an emergency. 
273 CARRIE 
Seeing the hose, getting the idea... NOTE: SPLIT SCREENS begin here. 
297 THE LIGHTING BAR 
298 CARRIE 
She flexes. 
299 CEILING POV 
Collins and Ernest directly below the path of the lighting bar. We see the flaming cyc on the stage collapse forward. The light bar begins to shake. Plaster drops, and the light bar DROPS ­ just short of Collins' head ­ as far as its wires carry it. 
300 CARRIE 
Watching all this ­ a giggle (or is it a sob?) emerging from deep within her. 
Another flex. 
301 THE LIGHT BAR 
starts to swing recklessly around the gym. Back and forth, back and forth ­ it hits the ceiling, igniting it and the decorations. Flaming stars and planets begin dropping from the ceiling. 
302 BENEATH THE STAGE ­ CHRIS AND BILLY 
seeing their chance to escape while Carrie is busy with the light bar. 
The back door (which Sue couldn't enter from the outside, and which the cyc flames prevented any of the students on the gym floor to get to) is now free, and Billy and Chris see their chance to escape. They burst out from under the stage as: 
303 CARRIE 
Spots them. In the instant it takes her to wonder what they're doing there, it's too late. They're out the door, and there's absolutely nothing she can do. 
304 THE GYM ­ FEATURING THE LIGHT BAR 
As it swings, catching Norma Watson in its path, casually whipping this screaming girl in her green chiffon dress back into a wall. 
Helen Shyres is backed into a corner, giggling with horror, in shock, utterly hysterical. 
Students have climbed onto the back of the bleachers, trying in vain to pry off the screens on the windows so they can escape. 
Morton has grabbed a chair and is trying to smash it through another of the windows. All this to no avail. End SPLIT SCREEN. 
305 CARRIE 
As she makes her way down the stage stairs and out onto the floor. She spots the cord going under the stage first, and realizes just how the trick was engineered... that Billy and Chris did it. 
306 THE STUDENTS 
Moving aside as Carrie walks through them ­ an endless series of blurred, hysterical faces. 
307 WIDE SHOT ­ THE GYM 
As Carrie makes it to one set of double doors, flexes them open, and exits. 
308 EXT. GYM ­ HALLWAY 
As Carrie exits, the doors swinging shut. Behind her, through the windows, we see a wall of fire collapse behind her. 
She passes Sue in the hall who's sobbing hysterically. And as Carrie exits, Sue runs into this inferno of fire to find Tommy. And then the town WHISTLE BLOWS... and BLOWS. It overlaps onto: 
DISSOLVE TO: 
309 EXT. TOWN STREETS ­ NIGHT 
Carrie's on her way home. At this point, she looks less like a girl that the survivor of a grisly car accident; wet, caked with blood, eyes glistening madly, almost shapeless. She goes down a hill, and then, from: 
310 ANOTHER ANGLE ­ THE HILL ­ NIGHT 
as a fire truck rushes toward the school, past Carrie. And then shortly afterward, out of nowhere, Billy's Chevy ­ it's headlights gleaming, lurches forward; it's headed right for her. 
311 CARRIE 
Turns around and sees it coming toward her. 
312 INT. THE CHEVY 
Chris screaming "Get her! Get her!" at the top of her lungs, Billy grinning madly behind the wheel. 
313 CARRIE 
As the Chevy heads right for her, standing in the headlights in its path, bloated, swaying back and forth, her arms thrown out. 
314 THE CHEVY 
Almost right on top of her... 
315 CARRIE 
Flexing, averting the car just as it almost smacks into her. It just misses her. 
316 INT. THE CHEVY 
Billy is livid, turning around to see Carrie in the back window. 
BILLY Goddamnit! 
CHRIS Billy!!! 
BILLY Shut up! Just shut up! 
Coming toward her. 
329 CARRIE 
She flings out her arms and cries out: 
CARRIE Oh, Momma! 
And throws herself against her mother, holds her. A movement from Margaret, a quick movement, hard to define. And Carrie recoils, her hands clutching her stomach. 
Briefly we see the knife in Margaret's hand. 
Then Carrie tumbles down the stairs. 
330 ANGLE DOWN STAIRS 
On Carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs. 
331 MARGARET 
Carrying the knife, she stares down the stairs. 
MARGARET It says in the Lord's Book: `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.' 
332 CARRIE 
Dazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted. She begins to crawl backwards, her eyes always on her mother, who is slowly but inexorably coming down the stairs. 
MARGARET And now the devil has come home. 
CARRIE (whimpering) Momma, it's not right. 
Carrie starts crawling to the kitchen. 
333 INT. KITCHEN ­ NIGHT 
Carrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen, just as Margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward Carrie, reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while. 
Carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut. 
Margaret is coming toward the kitchen. 
Carrie flexes again ­ to hold the door shut. 
But it's no use ­ Margaret is relentless now, and the door opens. She raises the knife and starts toward Carrie, the door swinging behind her. 
MARGARET I should have killed you when you were born. 
CARRIE Momma, I love you. Please help me! 
MARGARET Sin never dies. 
There's nothing else to be done. Carrie flexes, and a serving fork ­ dangling from a hook on the way ­ suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing Margaret. It is followed by another and another as a rain of instruments strikes Margaret. 
Margaret collapses. 
Carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother. 
And then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling her screams. 
CARRIE You. You tricked me. 
SUE No. 
CARRIE Get out. 
SUE We were just trying to... 
CARRIE Get out. 
And then something hits the roof, rattling. A small sound. A stone. 
Then another. 
Then a third. 
CARRIE Get out! Get out! 
The stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail. 
Sue is rooted to the spot, terrified. 
CARRIE Get out, get out, get out! 
The stones are coming down harder. All sound as one or two of them break through the roof, rattle on the floor below. 
CARRIE GET OUT! 
A stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen. 
Carrie flexes. 
And Sue stumbles backwards toward the door. 
Flex. 
Sue is whipped around, as though by a great wind.

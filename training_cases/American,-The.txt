At a fast food stand not far from the central train station, a middle-aged man is squirting ketchup on a hotdog. 
It is Autumn, and without the usual mass of Summer tourists, LARRY stands out as an American. 
JACK does not. 
JACK Blending in? 
LARRY is shocked to see JACK but pretends the hot dog is the centre of attention. 
LARRY Jack. What brings you to Rome? 
JACK I closed the Stockholm account. 
LARRY might be older than JACK but he doesn't seem it. His demeanour is sprightly. 
JACK But there were complications. 
Then LARRY turns and walks, eating carefully. He is not a man who likes to get his hands dirty. 
JACK walks beside him. 
Both men keep a trained eye on their surroundings. 
JACK Collateral damage. Two shooters. Unidentified. [A beat] And a girl. 
LARRY takes a bite of his hot dog and casts a sideways look at JACK. 
JACK is tired. 
LARRY There's a bar across the street: the L'Aquila. Freshen up. Sit tight. Give me two hours. 
10   INT. BAR- DAY                                                10 
JACK washes his face in the cramped bathroom at the back of the bar. 
In the background, on the stereo, The White Stripes cover One More Cup of Coffee. 
JACK stares at himself in the mirror. He looks exhausted. 
11   INT. BAR- DAY                                                11 
JACK is sitting at the back of the bar. He has a good view of the whole establishment: including the entrance and the door to the bathrooms. 
He lights a cigarette. 
LARRY comes in and sits opposite him. 
LARRY (genuinely shocked) You started smoking again? 
JACK exhales. 
JACK Guess so. 
LARRY Since when? 
JACK Since now. 
The WAITER slides over and flicks a cloth at the table. 
WAITER Cafe? 
LARRY Due. 
The WAITER disappears. 
A beat. 
LARRY puts an ENVELOPE on the table. 
LARRY Stockholm account. Final installment. 
JACK takes the envelope and puts it in an inside pocket. 
LARRY is about to speak but stops. 
The WAITER reappears and puts down two cups of coffee. 
LARRY puts two cubes of sugar in his cup and starts stirring. 
Then speaks low and fast: 
LARRY You can't stay here, Jack. You won't see `em coming, not in a big city. But you can't go far, either. If the gentlemen whose accounts you closed belonged to Brink, Gallazzo, Simenov- any of the first division- you have four or five hours at most before every airport, train station, bus stop, toll booth and ski lift from Stockholm to Skopje is under surveillance. 
JACK smokes. 
JACK So. 
Not a question. An acknowledgement that LARRY knows exactly what he's talking about. And JACK is listening. 
LARRY So. You find a hole- somewhere nearby- and you crawl into it and you stay put until I say it's safe to come out. 
JACK's expression is as immoveable as a cliff face. 
LARRY Turn right outside the bar then second left. Via Spinetti. You'll find a silver Citroen C2 with Chieti plates. Check the glove box and follow the map. Castelvecchio. It's a fucking fortress. Literally. And as dead as a graveyard. Anyone within a three to five mile radius you'll see `em coming. 
He pushes something across the table. A MOBILE PHONE in a cellophane bag. 
LARRY Get there. Stay there. 
LARRY finishes his coffee and dabs at the corners of his mouth with a napkin. 
LARRY Do nothing `till you get my call. 
12   INT. CAR- DAY                                               12 
JACK gets into a compact Citroen C2: nothing flash. 
He opens the glove compartment and finds a PLAIN MANILLA ENVELOPE. 
Inside the envelope is: 
22   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY                      22 
A toothbrush in the glass by the sink. 
The guidebook on the bedside table. 
Apart for this, JACK has avoided unpacking: living entirely out of his holdall for some time. 
From the holdall, JACK produces a pair of Leica 15x56 Geovid BRF Rangefinding BINOCULARS. 
Through his casement window he has good view of CASTELVECCHIO. 
He sweeps the town in grid formation: calm and methodical. This is a routine assessment. 
JACK's POV: apart from the occasional appearance of an old man, woman or dog, the dead town across the valley is empty. 
23   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                    23 
JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed and wide awake. 
Taped to the inside of the wooden bed frame... 
...is his WALTHER semi-automatic handgun. 
24   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OLD TOWN CENTRE- DAY                  24 
Blinding SUN fills frame. 
JACK is ostensibly photographing the sights: the mediaeval architecture, the square, the church. 
25   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH- DAY                           25 
The CHURCH is at the top of town. A PRIEST, dressed in black, surveys the world below him: 
Locals are going about their business, a few scattered tourists are enjoying their holiday. One `tourist' catches the PRIEST's attention. 
Perhaps it's his build. Or the fact that he's the only tourist on his own. Or perhaps it's the obsessive grid-like methodology with which JACK photographs the little town... 
26   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, ALLEYWAY- DAY                         26 
JACK turns casually down one of the town's many narrow alleyways. 
The alleyway way bends left and right in a series of blind corners and dark tunnels, the street enclosed by arches, criss-crossed by flying stone buttresses and flanked by outside stairwells. It's a stalker's heaven- or hell- depending on how dangerous the prey. 
JACK proceeds along the alleyway until he gets to a crossroads where FOUR NARROW ALLEYWAYS converge. Each alleyway leads uphill or downhill with varying degrees of steepness. JACK photographs each alleyway. 
From an upstairs window he can hear the soundtrack of a game show on television. From another alleyway comes the sound of a barking dog. 
No dog is visible. 
Curious, JACK turns around, walking back the way he came. 
The sound of barking gets louder. 
On his right hand side, JACK finds a HIDDEN ARCHWAY. 
The HIDDEN ARCHWAY resembles an archer's slit but is big enough for a gown man to slip through. Unlike a window, the `slit' is actually just a crack in a triangular convergence of two separate and slightly overlapping ancient stone walls. The confluence of two stone surfaces makes the narrow gap between them very, very difficult to spot. 
JACK slips though the HIDDEN ARCHWAY. 
Inside is a courtyard. 
27   INT. COURTYARD- DAY                                          27 
Rotting doors lead to abandoned cellars and storerooms. 
A MONGREL tied to a post is barking savagely, his leash keeping him inches from sinking his bared fangs into JACK. 
JACK stares at the dog: a mysterious creature of fear and fury. 
28   EXT. NARROW ALLEYWAY- DAY                                    28 
JACK reappears through the HIDDEN ARCHWAY and slips back into the narrow alleyway. It's like he's materialised from thin air. 
He takes 2 PHOTOGRAPHS: 
-first of the HIDDEN ARCHWAY 
-and then of the street sign: VIA ROMANA. 
Just then a MAN on an original 1970s DUCATI turns down the alleyway and drives towards him. 
Casually, JACK continues walking. 
The DUCATI gets nearer. The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a black crash helmet with a tinted visor. 
JACK picks up his pace. 
The DUCATI is ten metres away. 
JACK's right hand moves towards his pocket. 
Five metres. 
JACK's hand goes in his pocket. 
Two metres. 
BANG! 
JACK drops to his knees. 
BANG! 
The DUCATI backfires for a second time. 
A pause. 
Still on his knees, JACK pretends to tie his right shoe lace. 
The MAN ON THE DUCATI stops outside an apartment further up the alleyway, gets off his rickety motorbike and removes his helmet. He's a corpulent, ruddy faced Italian man in his late sixties. 
LARRY (V.O.) Do you have any idea how long I've been trying to reach you? What happened to the cell I gave you? 
JACK speaks quietly, keeping an eye on the town square: 
JACK Did I forget to mention my electromagnetic hypersensitivity? 
LARRY (V.O.) Don't get jumpy on me, Jack. That cell was secure. 
JACK lights a cigarette. 
LARRY (V.O.) I've got a job. It's a custom fit. You don't even have to pull the trigger. 
JACK Who's the client? 
LARRY (V.O.) Relax. She triple checks out. Plus she comes to you. You don't have to move an inch. 
JACK This is a small town, Larry. I don't like small towns. I grew up in one. Besides, I'm already attracting attention. 
LARRY (V.O.) So will anyone who's trying to kill you. 
This is a good point. 
JACK lights a cigarette. 
JACK I'll think about it. 
LARRY (V.O.) Think about this. I cleaned up your shit and made you disappear. You owe me my usual twenty percent commission plus the first installment. The rest is yours. After this you're free. 
On JACK. 
Turning over the word. 
31   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S HOUSE- MAGIC HOUR                    31 
The SUN is sinking behind the high mountains that overlook the hilltop town. 
JACK is wearing an immaculate white linen shirt. 
He's sitting in a small walled garden snuggled at the rear of a crumbling fifteenth century edifice, overlooked yet secluded and trapping the last rays of the sun. 
FATHER BENEDETTO pours two large glasses of brandy from a globulous green bottle of ARMAGNAC and sniffs his drink like a honey bee hovering over a bloom. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Que siamo! The quality of the brandy is good, the liquor is smooth and the glass warmed by the sun. 
He pronounces warmed "war-med". His English is sophisticated but quaint, like an out-of-date book. 
JACK sniffs his drink before he sips it. Not like a connoisseur: like a White House taster checking the safety of a Presidential beverage. 
FATHER BENEDETTO (in ENGLISH) The only good thing to come from the Francesi, everything else... 
FATHER BENEDETTO grimaces. 
FATHER BENEDETTO The French are... pezzi di merda. This is not an American discovery. Italians have known this for centuries. [In ITALIAN] When Rome called France the province of Gaul, they were just the same. Arrogant sensualists. Their cuisine is fussy and their wine effeminate. Only their brandy is worthy of any attention. 
FATHER BENEDETTO looks at JACK. 
FATHER BENEDETTO (in ENGLISH) Forgive me. I speak too fast. You study our history? 
JACK No. 
FATHER BENEDETTO looks horrified. 
FATHER BENEDETTO You come to Italy to make a guide book and you don't care about history? 
JACK I take pictures, father. 
A beat. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Of course. You are American. You think you can escape history. You live for the present. 
A beat. 
JACK likes this man. His shrewdness is disconcerting but humane. 
JACK sips his brandy. 
JACK I try to, father. 
32   EXT. L'AQUILA- EVENING                                       32 
Suburban sprawl with a mediaeval heart. L'AQUILA is the capital of the Abruzzo region and the nearest big town to Castel del Monte and Castelveccio. 
Like these two villages L'AQUILA is relatively isolated, nestled high up in the Appenine mountains. 
33   EXT. L'AQUILA, SHOPPING STREET- EVENING                      33 
JACK comes out of a SUPERMARKET carrying two bags of groceries and turns quickly down a dark side street. 
34   EXT. L'AQUILA, VIA LAMPEDUSA- EVENING                        34 
JACK passes a sign for a MODELLING AGENCY. It's a small, inconspicuous sign, but it catches his eye because its graphics are subtly lewd and it's attached to the buzzer of what is otherwise a purely residential apartment block. 
Entering the apartment block is a beautiful twenty four year- old Italian girl. 
CLARA. 
She catches JACK's eye. 
He walks on. 
35   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT 35 
The remnants of a simple yet sophisticated meal: apple, pecorino cheese, honey and walnuts. 
On his lap top, JACK has organised several weeks worth of PHOTOGRAPHS of CASTEL DEL MONTE into three categories: 
1. Street plan 
2. Exit routes/car 
3. Exit routes/foot 
She takes a long time to answer. When she does, she does so over the rim of her half-empty coffee cup, scanning the crowd like a cheating wife customarily anxious not to be seen by her husband. 
MATHILDE One fifty to one seven five meters. 
JACK Time? 
MATHILDE Five seconds. Seven at the most. 
JACK Targets? 
MATHILDE One. 
JACK Fire rate? 
MATHILDE Rapid. 
JACK Magazine capacity? 
MATHILDE Large. Preferably 9mm Parabellum. 
The WAITER delivers the Spremuta and the raspberry ice-cream. 
The glass of lemon juice twists in MATHILDE's slender fingers. 
MATHILDE The weapon must be fairly light. And compact. Possible to be broken down into its constituent parts. 
L'AMERICANO How compact? 
MATHILDE As compact as possible. 
JACK clears his throat. 
JACK You want a submachine gun to fit in a lady's purse? 
MATHILDE A small vanity case would be permissible. 
JACK A small briefcase would be possible. 
A beat. 
JACK X-rays? Camouflage: lap-top, DVD player, MP3 or digital camera? 
She's not sure if he's joking or not. Neither are we. 
MATHILDE Not necessary. 
JACK Noise? 
MATHILDE Silencer. 
JACK No such thing. You'll have to make do with a suppressor like everyone else. It'll dampen the decibels, dislocate the sound source and reduce muzzle flash. I can't make you silent but I can make you invisible as the Finnish phrase goes, but only as long as you're prepared to lose some range. 
JACK scans the crowd. 
On the other side of the square he spots a YOUNG MAN in his mid-thirties with short blonde hair and slight sunburn, hovering by a stall. Average height, slim, athletic build; sunglasses, stone-washed designer jeans very neatly pressed with a sharp crease. 
JACK Two o'clock. 
MATHILDE Excuse me? 
JACK By the clothes stall. Light blue shirt, open at the neck, expensive buff suede shoes. Is he with you? 
The YOUNG MAN has disappeared into the crowd. 
MATHILDE I didn't see him. In any case, I'm alone. 
A pause. 
JACK's jaw muscles grind. 
MATHILDE I can accept a slight loss of range. 
JACK You want a weapon with the firing capacity of a submachine gun and the range of a rifle. 
MATHILDE Can you do it? 
A beat. 
JACK Give me a month. To trial. Then a week for final adjustments. 
41   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, LANDSCAPE- TWILIGHT                    41 
The sun is sinking. 
It's hunting hour. 
A FALCON hovers on the wind above the town, looking for prey. 
42   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT                42 
JACK is lying on top of his bed, fully clothed but fast asleep. 
His eyes roll left and right beneath his lids. 
He's dreaming. 
In his right hand is a book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART & ARCHITECTURE. 
Twitching in his sleep, JACK's grip on the ART & ARCHITECTURE BOOK slowly loosens... 
THUD! 
As the BOOK hits the floor JACK opens his eyes, sits up and rips the taped WALTHER from beneath the bed, pointing it at the door. 
Silence. 
JACK's heart is beating. 
43   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- MORNING                   43 
JACK is looking through his BINOCULARS. 
48   INT. L'AQUILA, VIA LAMPEDUSA, CLARA'S ROOM- NIGHT            48 
Our beautiful twenty four year-old Italian girl enters. 
CLARA. 
She sits on the edge of the bed, whose ageing metal springs squeak slightly, and puts her smoking cigarette in an ashtray on the bedside table. 
She kicks off her slip-on shoes. 
Slips off her panties. 
Lifts her light cotton dress over her head and lies back on the bed in one practised motion. 
JACK sits on the bed beside her. 
He doesn't look at her. 
ITALIAN GIRL Amore? 
She reaches up to touch JACK as we cut to: 
49   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, PAY PHONE- DAY                        49 
JACK is scanning the town square with his usual cautiousness. 
JACK Your source in Rome. 
LARRY (V.O.) Clean bill of health and no OC. This was a straight favour with a dollar chaser, Jack. The guy's got a second cousin in NOCS on the graft who filched him the Socimi. 
JACK I hope you paid below the odds. The more you pay them the more cops gossip in the locker room. 
LARRY (V.O.) No one's gossiping, Jack. 
JACK watches FATHER BENEDETTO waving at him from the other side of the square. 
JACK Yet. 
50   EXT. TOWN SQUARE- DAY                                         50 
FATHER BENEDETTO is sitting in his API three-wheeler. 
This comical and endearing method of rural transportation is a cross between a moped and a miniature pick-up truck. 
In the back of the truck are a mass of writhing SNAKES. 
The API is turning over but it won't start. 
The bonnet is open. JACK is fixing the engine. 
He gives a signal and FATHER BENEDETTO turns the ignition key again. 
This time the engine starts. FATHER BENEDETTO claps and cheers. 
51   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING                      51 
Sixteenth century. Sombre wood panelling stained dark with polish and smoke. Two paraffin lamps stand on a huge antique sideboard, their frosted orbs engraved with scenes from the life of Our Lord. 
The room is filled with a dining table: a massive black edifice of oak, five inches thick with six legs fluted like the columns of cathedrals. 
Using antique crockery, ancient copper pots and utensils like old fashioned instruments of torture FATHER BENEDETTO performs culinary alchemy: transforming flesh into meat, dough into bread, hard earth nuggets into vegetables. 
He hums as he cooks: Opera arias. And Johnny Cash. 
JACK sips from a glass of wine and watches FATHER BENEDETTO potter around the wood fired stove. The priest has his own wine which he sips as he works between bouts of humming. 
52   INT. FATHER BENEDETTO'S KITCHEN- EVENING                      52 
JACK eats a bowl of chilled carrot and sorrel soup in silence. 
FATHER BENEDETTO watches him, pleased to see his guest so absorbed. 
As soon as JACK has finished, FATHER BENEDETTO invites him to help himself from the ancient tureen. 
Then he bustles over to the stove, humming again. 
JACK eats, studying a framed photo of FATHER BENEDETTO with his arm around a tough, corpulent Italian man in his mid- twenties. FABIO. 
FATHER BENEDETTO returns to the table with a large covered dish issuing steam into his face. 
He notices JACK's eye-line. 
FATHER BENEDETTO All the sheep in my flock are dear to me, but some are dearer than most. Especially those that have strayed from the fold. 
Off JACK's intrigued look FATHER BENEDETTO clarifies: 
FATHER BENEDETTO Fabio. He is a... [in ITALIAN] 'car doctor'. But I suspect his practice is not entirely sound. Ecco! 
FATHER BENEDETTO whisks the lid off the covered dish revealing a stew of poultry carcasses covered in sauce. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Fagiano. Pheasant. With sauce of orange juice, orange peel, chestnuts, garlic, Marsala wine and... Come si dici in Inglese? Brodo di Pollo. Chicken broth. 
FATHER BENEDETTO serves each of them with a complete bird and pours white wine into fresh glasses. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Also: salsify in garlic butter. Mange-tout. Fried wild mushrooms with truffle. 
JACK helps himself to vegetables. 
FATHER BENEDETTO watches him as he savours his first taste. 
JACK licks his lips and sips some cold white wine. 
The two men regard one another, the priest awaiting a verdict. 
JACK Sinful. 
FATHER BENEDETTO shrugs. 
FATHER BENEDETTO The Holy Father eats better than this. 
The flash of a smile crosses the priest's face. 
JACK looks at the TOOLS hanging on the walls and littering the work benches. 
FABIO shrugs. 
FABIO (in ITALIAN) Help yourself. [In ENGLISH] My garage is your garage. 
JACK I appreciate that. 
FABIO gets on with work, sliding himself beneath the resprayed Alfa Romeo. 
JACK picks out various implements, laying them on the work surface: drill, hacksaw, lathe, vice, mallet. 
Behind an oil pan with a jagged hole in it he discovers several GEAR WHEELS with the teeth sheared off. He holds the biggest one up. 
JACK Bene? 
FABIO is engrossed his work. 
FABIO Si! Si! Va bene! 
JACK Quant'e? 
FABIO grins and growls. A gearwheel with no bite is useless to him. 
FABIO Niente! 
JACK wraps the gearwheel in a sheet of oily newspaper and puts it in the sports bag with the tools. 
At the door, he pauses. 
That's when JACK sees it on the notice board. A PHOTOGRAPH of FATHER BENEDETTO and FABIO. FABIO is much younger in this photo: fourteen or fifteen years old. He's wearing an AS Roma football strip. Again: the priest has his arm around the boy. 
JACK Ciao. Grazie. 
FABIO Ciao, Americano! 
57   INT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH- DAY                           57 
FATHER BENEDETTO rings the CHURCH BELLS for Mass. 
58   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, CHURCH TOWER- CONTINUOUS              58 
THREE CHURCH BELLS ringing: large, medium and small. 
As the CLAPPERS hit the SOUNDBOWS we smash cut to: 
59   INT. JACK'S ROOM, PENSIONE ABRUZZO- CONTINUOUS               59 
JACK has laid out his newly acquired tools on the flag stone floor of his room. 
Beside them is the SOCIMI SUB-MACHINE GUN. 
Using the CHURCH BELLS as sound cover... 
...JACK puts the GEARWHEEL on a flag stone tile and smashes it into five pieces with a four pound MALLET. 
60   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO- NIGHT                                 60 
By torchlight, JACK is fashioning CONNECTORS from the smashed steel gear. 
It's very, very tricky work and his eyes ache in the poor light. 
61   EXT. ITALIAN LANDSCAPE- DAY                                  61 
JACK is wearing a knapsack. He's crossing a MEADOW and making his way towards a RUINED HAMLET. His manner is dark, purposeful, alert. 
The grass is long and the trees offer deep shade. JACK stops. Everywhere there is a profusion of wild flowers. 
His guardedness begins to evaporate. He has never seen anything so beautiful or utterly uncorrupted. He looks around, transfixed by delicate yellows and mauves, brash whites, harsh and brilliant crimsons, exquisite blues. The air is humming with insects, bees and butterflies. 
JACK is transfixed. 
62   EXT. RUINED HAMLET- DAY                                      62 
JACK scrambles up towards the abandoned houses, sweating in the heat. 
His original cautiousness has returned. Carefully, he checks the area for signs of recent disturbance. From the foot of the deserted hamlet he surveys the VALLEY with binoculars, monitoring every square on an imaginary grid for human activity. Satisfied that he's alone, he takes a deep breath of mountain air. 
And scrambles back down to the valley. 
63   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                              63 
JACK has parked his CITROEN in the shade of a squat but ample WALNUT TREE. In the near distance is a LAKE. 
JACK crunches over half-formed walnuts until he reaches a patch of soft grass beside the water. 
This, he decides, is the perfect spot. He unrolls a blanket, kneels, and from his KNAPSACK he produces: 
-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of Frascati 
-a loaf of course bread 
-50 gms of pecorino 
-100 gms of proscuitto 
-a small jar of black olives 
-an orange 
-and a rolled blanket containing the disassembled parts of the SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN. 
JACK sets the stopwatch on his weather beaten ROLEX. 
It takes approximately thirty-four seconds to assemble the bastardised SOCIMI- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND SUPPRESSOR- and a further six seconds to press TEN ROUNDS into the magazine, slot it into the base of the hand grip, snuggle the butt to his shoulder and place his eye beside the rubber cup on the sight. 
He's fast. 
Carefully he surveys the lake. Settles on a CLUMP OF REEDS. And with the focus and dexterity of a surgeon, concentrates until his grip and aim are perfectly tense and still. 
A beat... 
JACK takes his right hand from his pocket. 
He's clutching the WALTHER. 
Slowly, he reaches his left hand upwards, towards the lintel above the door where he finds... 
...a single FEATHER. 
71   INT. JACK'S ROOM- NIGHT                                    71 
From the inside of the room we watch four sturdily fashioned deadbolt locks slide open. Each lock is new and home made. 
JACK enters, shuts the door, locks all four bolts. And sits on the bed. 
72   EXT. ROADSIDE PAY PHONE- MORNING                           72 
A cluster of houses by the side of a main road: a bar, a restaurant, a phone box. 
JACK puts a coin in the slot. Two rings. 
LARRY (V.O.) Jack? 
JACK I've got company. 
JACK scans the area outside. 
JACK If he's not baby-sitting the Belgian contract then he's either a Joe, a cop or a shooter. He's not with The Company, they're fast: it's been three days and no TA. He's not intel: they're deep background and he wants to be noticed. He might be a cowboy but he can't be a cop: they work in pairs and he's alone. Strike Guarda di Finanza, State Police and NOCS: he's not Italian- he doesn't look like one, dress like one or behave like one. So who the hell is he? 
A beat. 
JACK Larry? 
LARRY (V.O.) You got a long list of enemies, Jack. 
JACK What's he waiting for? 
JACK hears the sound of an engine. 
His hand moves to his pocket. 
LARRY (V.O.) Jack? 
He watches a black VW SHARON pass. There's a family inside. 
LARRY (V.O.) Want me to help take care of this? 
JACK I can handle it. 
LARRY (V.O.) You sound spooked. 
JACK It's a bad line. 
LARRY (V.O.) Jack? 
JACK Yes? 
LARRY (V.O.) I appreciate the value of a pre- emptive strike in circumstances like these, I really do, but if you're going to go Generation Kill then do me a favour, OK, because I'm running out of bribe money. [A BEAT] Make it look like an accident. 
73   EXT. TRAIN STATION- DAY                                    73 
Little more than a halt: one platform, one track, one station building- locked and shuttered. 
JACK steps out of his car. 
No one around. 
He checks his watch: it's exactly noon. 
A TRAIN approaches. 
It's a three-carriage local. It rattles round the bend in the track up the valley, diesel fumes pluming. There are no more than a dozen passengers on board. 
MATHILDE is the only one to alight. 
Her once brown hair is now BLONDE. She's wearing a light summer skirt and carrying a navy blue canvas sports bag. 
They shake hands as the train pulls away, belching and honking as it rattles over the girders of an iron bridge and crosses some alpine rapids. 
MATHILDE Mr. Clarke. How good to see you again. 
Something quaint, old fashioned in her diction. English with the hint of a Belgian accent. 
JACK opens the boot of his car and she places her sports bag beside a WICKER PICNIC HAMPER. 
MATHILDE Refreshments? 
JACK The Carabinieri around here like roadblocks. It's cover. 
She nods. 
They get into the car. 
As the JACK's door slams we smash cut to: 
74   INT. CAR- DAY                                                74 
MATHILDE's sunglasses reflect the alpine landscape. 
MATHILDE You picked a beautiful spot. 
She takes off her shades. 
Her once hazel eyes are now GREY-BLUE. 
She glances round the hire car's drab plastic interior. 
MATHILDE You would be hard pressed to make a fast get away in this. 
Perhaps she's nervous. Her attempt at humour isn't working and she stumbles slightly on her grammar: 
MATHILDE I would have thought you to have had at least an Alfa Romeo. 
JACK Yes. 
Satisfied that he's alone, he lowers his binoculars. MATHILDE takes a deep breath of mountain air. 
MATHILDE It's beautiful here. 
She is sitting on a loose stone wall at the edge of what was once a terraced field. Her dress dips between her legs as she leans forward and rests her forearms on her knees, tired from the journey and the long, hot climb. 
MATHILDE I wish everywhere could be this tranquil. 
JACK looks at her, sensing a kindred spirit. 
JACK You'd be out of a job. 
MATHILDE You don't like the peace? 
JACK It's hard to like something you know nothing about. 
79   EXT. WOODS- DAY                                            79 
The WICKER PICNIC HAMPER is sitting on a rug by between the parked car and the lake. From the hamper, JACK removes: 
-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of Aspirinio 
-a loaf of course bread 
-two clods of mozarella 
-150 gms of proscuitto 
-100 gms of parma ham 
-a large jar of pitted green olives 
-a Thermos of sweet black coffee 
-and, wrapped in cloth squares, the disassembled parts of the improved SOCIMI SUBMACHINE GUN. 
As MATHILDE starts to assemble the weapon with easy skill, JACK checks the stopwatch on his ROLEX. 
It takes her approximately twenty-eight seconds to assemble the bastardised gun- including TELESCOPIC SIGHTS and SOUND SUPPRESSOR- and a further three seconds to slot the empty magazine into the base of the hand grip, snuggle the butt to her shoulder and place her eye beside the rubber cup on the sight. 
She's almost ten seconds faster than JACK. 
He stares at her: not an alluring young woman with good legs and nice tits but an extension of the weapon itself and everything it means. 
MATHILDE Rounds? 
JACK I've made up two sorts. 
He reaches into the PICNIC HAMPER. 
JACK Thirty lead and thirty jacketed. 
MATHILDE I should like a hundred of each. 
It's an order: her voice is emotionless. 
MATHILDE And fifty explosive. 
JACK Not a problem. 
He hands her the practise ammunition in two small cartridge boxes: the shells snug in little plastic trays. 
JACK Will mercury do? 
She smiles almost imperceptibly. 
MATHILDE Mercury will do very nicely. 
She puts the gun down butt-first, leaning it against the side of the car. 
MATHILDE I have made my own targets. 
She reaches into her BLUE CANVAS SPORTS BAG and removes several pieces of folded cardboard strengthened with split bamboo cane. 
Without speaking she sets off through the alpine blooms. In her wake flutter a confetti of butterflies and grass crickets, honey bees sizzling frantically as her loose summer skirt sweeps across the flowers. 
JACK Watch out for vipers. 
He keeps his voice down but she hears him nonetheless, waving with her right hand: the hand holding the AMMUNITION BOXES. She's no fool. 
Neither is he. He has the gun. 
At ninety meters distance she stops beside a pile of smooth stones- a boundary cairn- overgrown with little purple trumpet blooms. 
She unfolds the cardboard. At this distance all we can make out is a silver-grey shape against the stones. 
Returning to the car she picks up the weapon. 
MATHILDE Muzzle velocity? 
JACK At least three hundred and sixty miles per hour. That's including twenty off the top for the sound suppression. 
Impressed, MATHILDE looks at the marks on the metal where the serial number has been removed with acid. 
MATHILDE Socimi? 
JACK Eight-two-one. 
MATHILDE I've not had one before. 
JACK You'll find it easy. I've re- balanced it for the longer barrel. The fulcrum is two centimetres forward of the grip now. Which won't matter if you're firing- and I'm guessing you are- from a fixed position. 
No answer. 
JACK No major recoil issues. You should be able to hold onto any target. Even the smallest. 
MATHILDE puts two jacketed rounds into the magazine and stands with her feet apart, braced. The breeze beneath the walnut tree ruffles her summer skirt and presses it against her legs. 
CHOOP! CHOOP! 
The bed is empty, the sheets twisted and damp. 
87   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAWN                                   87 
SUNRISE... 
...over one of the most desolate and beautiful landscapes in all Italy. 
88   INT. JACK'S ROOM- DAWN                                        88 
In the gun-metal light of dawn, fiddly work: 
-cartridges taken apart 
-tiny holes drilled in the nose to a depth of precisely 3mm 
-the hole half-filled with mercury 
-and plugged with a drop of liquid lead. 
JACK is converting jacketed ammunition into EXPLOSIVE BULLETS. 
89   INT. CHURCH- DAY                                              89 
Outside, the sun is merciless. Inside, JACK has taken refuge in the cool of the church. He is alone. He is not praying. Just staring impassively at the gaudy crucifixion: at the thorns and the nails and the running blood. 
Footsteps. JACK checks for reflections in his watch. 
It's FATHER BENEDETTO: dressed for Mass. 
FATHER BENEDETTO I've been looking for you. 
He mops the sweat from his brow with the hem of his Soutane, takes JACK by the arm and leads him to one side, away from the light of the candles. 
FATHER BENEDETTO A man was here asking questions about you. 
A beat. 
JACK Here? 
FATHER BENEDETTO He came to the church this afternoon. 
JACK What did he want? 
FATHER BENEDETTO To know where you live. He said he was a friend from Switzerland. 
JACK Switzerland? 
JACK thinks. 
JACK And you told him? 
The priest looks at with complete disdain: 
FATHER BENEDETTO Of course I do not tell him. How do I know him? He is maybe the police. Certainly he is no friend. A friend would know your pensione. Besides... 
FATHER BENEDETTO leans close and whispers: 
FATHER BENEDETTO Friends do not carry guns. 
FATHER BENEDETTO glances shrewdly at JACK, his eyes searching into him. 
FATHER BENEDETTO If you live in Italy, and you are a man of the cloth, you meet many people. Besides, I lived once in Naples. If you live in Naples you know the difference between a fat wallet and a... custodia per armi di spalla. How you say in English? 
JACK Shoulder holster. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Si. 
JACK glances up and down the aisle. 
OLD LADIES are dribbling into church in twos and threes. 
The BELL for mass starts ringing. 
JACK You're a true friend, father. 
FATHER BENEDETTO I am a priest. 
JACK turns to go. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Signor Clarke? 
Again the priest leans close, holding JACK by the elbow in a gesture of austere confidence. 
FATHER BENEDETTO I make a mistake. He did not say he was from La Svizzera: Switzerland. He said- forgive me the names in Italian are so similar- La Svezia: Sweden. 
90   EXT. CHURCH, ROOF- DAY                                      90 
THREE BELLS are ringing in the tower. Beneath them, a row of mediaeval GARGOYLES (dragons, griffins, dogs and devils) look down over the little town, their faces frightening or frightened. 
JACK is among the gargoyles, leaning over parapet, his eyes made huge by a pair of tiny binoculars, surveying the town below, checking each square of the grid for a glimpse of the YOUNG MAN. 
Nothing. Then he notices: 
Parked in the shadow of a spreading chestnut tree not far from the main square. An AUDI... 
...with the YOUNG MAN we spotted in Castelveccio market sitting at the wheel. 
91   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, STREET- NIGHT                        91 
The YOUNG MAN comes out of a shop. 
This is the first time we've seen him up close. In his early thirties, he's wearing a dark brown leather jacket and expensive jeans. His blonde hair is cropped short, and there's the hint of a botched prison-cell tattoo visible just beneath the collar of his shirt. 
The YOUNG MAN opens a small silver tin and a single deft movement removes a portion of SNUS (Swedish chewing tobacco) and inserts the it between his top lip and gum. 
It is a strangely sinister act. 
Then he blends in with the tourists, milling down the Corso and round the square heading towards... 
92   INT. BAR- NIGHT                                              92 
The YOUNG MAN looks his way. 
JACK is outlined by the moped's beam of light. 
The two men are face to face, within spitting distance. 
The DUCATI hurtles towards the YOUNG MAN. 
The MAN ON THE DUCATI is wearing a tinted BLACK CRASH HELMET. 
The YOUNG MAN's eyes widen with fear. 
BANG! 
The DUCATI misfires. 
Mistaking the sound for gunfire, the YOUNG MAN drops, rolls and fires back. 
We hear the sound of a single suppressed shot: CHOOP! 
The BULLET grazes the FRONT SUSPENSION of the DUCATI and lodges in the REAR COWLING. 
The MAN ON THE DUCATI swerves and crashes, hitting a stone staircase. 
JACK looks around. 
The YOUNG MAN has disappeared. 
The MAN ON THE DUCATI is out cold. 
The front wheel of his DUCATI turns slowly, squeaking. 
CHOOP! 
A bullet hits the road not far from JACK. 
CHOOP! 
Another bullet hits the wall behind him. 
Swiftly, JACK grabs hold of the battered 1970s DUCATI... 
98    EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE,    MEDIAVEVAL MAZE- NIGHT             98 
JACK rides the classic DUCATI, turning left and right without hesitation, through archways, down steps, dropping level by level, cursing in time with his jagged breathing until... 
99    EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN- NIGHT              99 
JACK emerges from the bottom of the town and races away on the winding road. 
Silence. All we can hear are the crickets. 
Then the sound of a car. 
An AUDI tears past us, following JACK out of town. 
100   EXT. ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT                                    100 
JACK is heading for the mountains. He takes the first corner at 70 MPH. 
The AUDI gleams black in the moonlight. Gaining on him. 
101   EXT. ANOTHER ANGLE- NIGHT                                  101 
JACK takes the next bend at top speed, his classic 1970 1000cc engine howling. 
The AUDI slows, then powers through the bend, accelerating. 
102   INT. AUDI- NIGHT                                            102 
The YOUNG MAN puts his foot down. 
The SPEEDOMETER climbs. 
103   EXT. ALPINE ROAD- NIGHT                                     103 
The AUDI comes up swiftly behind Jack's DUCATI and tries to ram him. 
JACK dodges the AUDI, swerving from one side of the road to another. 
104   EXT. VIADUCT- NIGHT                                         104 
A soaring concrete bridge spans a plunging alpine valley. 
The AUDI overtakes the DUCATI, then swerves left, trying to crush JACK against the concrete barrier that masks a three hundred and fifty foot fall. 
JACK breaks hard and the AUDI misses him, smashing into the concrete barrier amidst a shower of sparks and screeching metal. 
The AUDI follows the DUCATI into... 
105   EXT. ALPINE TUNNEL- NIGHT                                   105 
Long, dark, neon-lit... and blind curved. 
The AUDI comes up fast behind the DUCATI. 
Jack swerves the DUCATI onto the other side of the road. 
The AUDI swerves left and tries to crush JACK into the left- hand wall of the tunnel. 
Suddenly, a CAR comes round the bend. 
What happens next happens fast: 
JACK swerves left and skids into a SERVICE LAY-BY, narrowly avoiding the CAR. 
The lay-by is small and JACK has to slide the DUCATI on it's side as he crashes it into the box-like space. 
The lay-by is too small for the AUDI. 
The AUDI and oncoming CAR collide. 
JACK What makes you think I'm leaving? 
FATHER BENEDETTO You told me as much when we first met. Besides, those who seek for peace seldom find it. They're always moving on, looking elsewhere. [A BEAT] And they are usually sinners. 
JACK All men are sinners. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Some are greater sinners than others. And those who seek peace have much sinning in their history. 
JACK I don't seek peace. I never have. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Until now. 
JACK Perhaps. Perhaps I'll stay. The valley. The villages. The mountains. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Forgive me. This is the priest in me speaking. And the friend. But you have done much sinning, Signor Clarke. You still do. 
JACK I see a whore. She's young enough to be my daughter. 
FATHER BENEDETTO I do not refer to the sins of carnality. But to the deadly sins... 
JACK Aren't all sins equal? 
FATHER BENEDETTO We are not discussing theology, my friend, but you. You like this town, this valley. (MORE) 
FATHER BENEDETTO (cont'd) You should like to remain here and find your peace at last. Yet you cannot. There is something you cannot ignore. Some force. Some enemy. 
JACK is silent. 
FATHER BENEDETTO You want to speak but you dare not. You know no one sufficiently well to share your history with them. You know I am trustworthy yet still you are cautious. 
FATHER BENEDETTO stops, compelling JACK to stop too- and face him. 
FATHER BENEDETTO What job do you do, Signor? Are you on the run, as they say? 
JACK Who says? 
FATHER BENEDETTO It's an expression, no? 
JACK Everyone's on the run from something. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Some men watch some of the shadows. You watch them all. 
JACK I've done nothing I didn't have good cause to do. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Do you wish to tell me? 
JACK For what reason? 
FATHER BENEDETTO For your own sake. Perhaps I can pray for you? 
A change of pace. 
JACK I make things. Artifacts. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Counterfeit money? 
JACK Why do you say that? 
FATHER BENEDETTO You work in metal. You are given some steel by Fabio, the car doctor. 
JACK You know a lot about me. 
FATHER BENEDETTO I know only what you do in the town. People talk to me. I am their priest and they trust me. 
JACK And I should too? 
FATHER BENEDETTO Of course. 
They stare at one another. 
JACK wants to confess. He does not know why. 
But he doesn't. He does something we're not expecting: 
JACK Fabio. The `car doctor'. Was he conceived here father? 
FATHER BENEDETTO is motionless. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Why do you ask me that? 
JACK He looks like you. Even more than he does in the photos you keep of each other. Where was he conceived, father? Under one of these trees? At night? Like all the other bastards? 
There is a very, very long pause. FATHER BENEDETTO stares up at JACK with extraordinary intensity. 
FATHER BENEDETTO I do not remember, Signor. It was twenty-five years ago. 
FATHER BENEDETTO walks. JACK follows. A gust of wind makes dust swirl from the gravel path. The two men do not speak again until they reach the next set of Cyprus trees. 
FATHER BENEDETTO In the end it is I who confesses to you. 
JACK Expecting me to reciprocate? 
FATHER BENEDETTO Perhaps. For your own good. You cannot doubt the existence of Hell. You live in it. It is a place without love. As for me, I go about my daily duties because the town requires it of me. Some know what you know. Perhaps I have no right to wear these robes. But I do have a heart full of a father's love. Something close to His heart! And for that I am both grateful and happy. 
On JACK. 
FATHER BENEDETTO What do you have, my friend? 
Another gust of wind. The priest looks up into JACK's face. 
The assassin's eyes are red and stinging. Perhaps its from the dust. 
118   INT. JACK'S ROOM- EVENING                                  118 
JACK dresses very carefully for dinner. 
It is clear he wishes to make a favourable impression upon CLARA. 
119   EXT. LOCANDA GRAPELLI- NIGHT                               119 
Stone steps lead up from the street to large paved veranda that overlooks the town. Overhead a canopy of vine and jasmine. Above that a sky full of stars. 
They are saved by the appearance of the WAITER. 
WAITER Buona sera. Desidera? 
CLARA orders, full of Italian charm, putting JACK at his ease. He watches her contentedly: the way she talks and moves. 
121   EXT. CORSO FREDERICO- NIGHT                                  121 
JACK   and CLARA are walking. He has a cigarette in his mouth. They   look like film stars. CLARA slips her arm through his. They   say nothing. The pedestrian shopping street is thronging with   other couples. 
122   EXT. COFFEE BAR- NIGHT                                       122 
The coffee bar has an outside section. CLARA and L'AMERICANO are seated in a throng of happy youngsters Clara's age. JACK is the oldest person there. 
The WAITRESS brings two glasses of PROSECCO. She puts a small silver bowl of raspberry ice cream down in front of JACK. In front of CLARA she puts down an extravagant ice cream sundae. CLARA grins at her sundae like a little girl. She's a bit drunk. 
CLARA Woooow! 
She eats, savoring the ice cream. JACK watches, savoring her pleasure. 
JACK How is it? 
CLARA Bitchin'. 
JACK (amused) Bitchin'? 
CLARA It's- come se dice- `slang', no? Eco. 
She scoops a spoonful dripping with nuts and chocolate sauce and holds it out to JACK. 
JACK No thanks. 
CLARA Come on, Eduardo! 
He hesitates. He eats. 
CLARA It is good, you will agree? 
JACK (his mouth full) I will agree. 
CLARA (sensing his teasing) My English is nice! 
JACK It's bitchin'. 
CLARA (defending herself) You know how to swear in Italian? 
JACK Sure. Bastardo. Imbecile. 
CLARA "Imbecile?" Eduardo! Try: Mangia merde e morte: tuo cazzo un brufolo. 
JACK Eat shit and die, pimple dick? 
CLARA hiccups. 
CLARA Perdone! 
JACK I guess I've led a sheltered life. Of sorts. 
CLARA Shell-tered? 
JACK Too much work. 
CLARA's CELL PHONE starts to ring. It's on silent, but the screen is flashing, just visible where it sticks out of her handbag. CLARA looks down at the phone. 
CLARA Too much work. 
She turns the phone to silent. And looks up at JACK. 
CLARA I don't apologise, Eduardo. 
JACK For what? 
CLARA For this I do. My job. 
JACK Never apologise. 
He means it. 
A beat. 
CLARA Except this job is full of testa di cazzo. 
JACK Mine too. 
CLARA Lei? 
JACK Si. 
CLARA But you are too young to... pensione? 
JACK Retire. 
CLARA Si. 
JACK Liar. 
CLARA No! 
JACK Would you be flattering me if I wasn't a client? 
He's put CLARA on the spot. 
JACK Am I a client? 
CLARA takes a deep breath. 
CLARA This say yes. 
She points at her head. 
CLARA This... 
LARRY (V.O.) I told `em if we couldn't trust you to keep a tight lid on operations the who could we trust? 
JACK They can. They can trust me and so can you. 
JACK is tense. Every word is carefully enunciated: 
JACK I've never jeopardised an operation in my life. 
LARRY (V.O.) You don't have to tell me that, Jack. For Christ's sake, you closed your own girlfriend's account... 
ECU on JACK. 
127   INT. LARRY'S APARTMENT, ROME- DAY                            127 
The words are out before he can stop them. 
LARRY Jack? [A BEAT] Jack? I'm sorry. 
He rubs his eyes, wearied by his own insensitivity. 
LARRY That was, um.... I'm just saying you can be relied on. 
Silence. 
LARRY Jack? 
CLICK. 
128   EXT. PAY PHONE- DAY                                          128 
JACK has hung up. 
He is lost in fearful thought, jaw muscles grinding. 
129   EXT. CHURCH, ROOF- NIGHT                                     129 
Amongst the GARGOYLES... 
...JACK, looking through his miniature binoculars. 
His POV: 
Of CLARA seated in a cafe talking to a slick, tough YOUNG ITALIAN MAN in a suit. 
He is showing her photographs. Of what- we cannot see. CLARA looks very, very serious. 
The YOUNG ITALIAN MAN leaves. JACK watches him get into a smart black ALFA ROMEO containing two other ITALIAN MEN. Rome plates. 
When he looks back at the cafe, CLARA has gone. 
130   INT. PENSIONE ABRUZZO, JACK'S ROOM- DAY                     130 
JACK opens his PICNIC HAMPER and in it he puts: 
-a polystyrene cool box packed with ice and containing a chilled bottle of Aspirinio 
-a loaf of course bread 
-two clods of mozarella 
-150 gms of proscuitto 
-and his WALTHER PPK/S. 
131   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE- DAY                                  131 
CLARA is waiting on the Via Strinella near the entrance to the Parco della Resistanza, sheltering in the shade of a tree. 
She is holding the RED PURSE. At her feet is blue plastic bag rounded out by a watermelon. 
JACK pulls his CAR into the curb. 
CLARA Ciao, Eduardo! 
She opens the passenger door, leans in and kisses JACK long and full on the lips. 
JACK Put them in the back. We've got a way to go. 
She puts the plastic bag in the trunk. 
Inside the trunk is the PICNIC HAMPER. 
132   INT. CAR-   DAY                                             132 
CLARA climbs in and fastens her seat-belt. 
She puts the RED PURSE between her legs. JACK glances at the RED PURSE. 
And drives. 
CLARA Where we go? 
JACK Swimming. 
CLARA How far do we go? To Fanale? 
JACK An hour. And we're not going to the sea, we're going to the lakes. In the mountains. 
CLARA For a... come se dice... you have in the back... 
JACK A picnic. 
CLARA A pick-nick! We are going for a pick-nick. Just the two of us. 
She looks at him. 
CLARA I have practise my English, Eduardo. I love to have pick-nick. It is a beautiful day, isn't it? 
JACK It is. 
133   EXT. ALPINE ROAD- DAY                                      133 
She speaks so quietly JACK can barely hear her. 
JACK No. 
CLARA Just you. 
JACK Yes. 
CLARA turns away, unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the grass. She is wearing no bra. On her back dapple the shadows and patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut. She kicks off her shoes, which curve through the air... and unzips her skirt. It falls to the grass. She bends and steps daintily from her knickers. Then turns to face JACK. 
JACK cannot take his eyes off her. Dizzy, he steps forward without meaning to. 
CLARA Well? 
She is coquettish- and tosses her auburn hair to one side. 
CLARA I am going to swim in the lake. Are you coming? 
She doesn't wait for his reply, but turns and runs through the grass towards the water. 
JACK There are vipers! Vipera! Marasso! 
CLARA Maybe! But I am lucky! 
The HERON flies off, rising from the reeds with an ungainly flapping. 
CLARA (shouting) He is an Italian bird! We disturb his siesta! 
Quickly, JACK glances inside the CITROEN. 
The RED PURSE is nowhere to be seen. 
CLARA Come, Signor Farfalla! 
JACK undresses. As he removes his clothes, he stalls for time, using the cover of undressing to search for the RED PURSE. 
We can see it wedged under the passenger seat. 
Due to the design of the car, JACK cannot. 
CLARA Come! 
JACK turns to face the lake. He is naked. Yet with the caution of years he does not remove his shoes until he reaches the water's edge. 
CLARA is standing in the middle. 
CLARA Stand by me. 
He obeys her order. He walks out to her and she takes his hand under the water, holding it out in front of them. 
JACK spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake-bed. Brassy and gleaming. A SPENT SHELL. He covers it with his foot. 
CLARA Keep still. Watch. 
As the ripples of his arrival peter out in the reeds, TINY FISH appear in a shoal to gather about their hands. They hover like slivers of glass just under the surface then move in to nibble at the skin on their fingers. 
JACK If we stay here for a year, they'll devour us. 
CLARA It is said that if these fishes bite at two hands holding, then love is good for the people. 
He looks at her and for a moment he forgets the awful plan in his head. 
She kisses him, pressing herself against him, her skin and body as pure and warm as the water. 
He tries helplessly to pull away. 
JACK Maybe we should... 
CLARA Do you make love in the water? 
JACK I haven't. 
She places her arms around his neck and raises her feet from the smooth stones, wrapping her legs around his waist. She tries to push herself onto him but he resists. 
CLARA What's wrong? 
He doesn't know what to say. She looks at him: confused, searching. 
JACK Let's eat. 
He walks towards the bank. She follows. The tiny fish dart around them for a few moments then flee for the reeds, travelling with the waves made by their departure. 
137   EXT. LAKESIDE- DAY                                         137 
CLARA is lying naked on a blanket. 
Beside her is the RED PURSE. 
Through sleepy, half-closed eyes she is watching L'AMERICANO. 
From her POV, JACK is kneeling behind the open PICNIC HAMPER, unpacking the food and wine. The LID of the basket obscures his hands. 
CLARA Eduardo. 
JACK looks at her. 
CLARA Is this your real name? 
A beat. 
JACK Is Clara yours? 
CLARA Si. Yes. 
She looks at him. Waiting for his reply. 
JACK Edward is my real name. 
CLARA Ed-ward. 
She doesn't believe him. 
CLARA Non capito... how one person hurt another in this way. 
JACK looks lost, like a man drained of all resolution. 
JACK Does the gun make you feel safer with me? 
CLARA You are not a client. 
JACK Then why's it in your purse? 
CLARA looks unhappy. 
CLARA I have to work tonight, amore. 
Silence. 
JACK looks away. 
JACK (V.O.) Maybe this is suicide. Cops often put the graft on working girls. Perhaps the girl I told you about, Clara, has sold me out. (MORE) 
JACK (V.O.) (cont'd) Maybe she's a cop herself, or maybe she's a hired gun. Then again, maybe Clara is who she says she is and my Belgian clients will take the gun, shoot me themselves and keep the money. Always a risk in my profession. Or perhaps my trusted colleague in Rome no longer trusts me. Perhaps even you, Father, with your connections in Naples... 
CLARA What will you do? 
JACK I guess I'll go to work too. 
CLARA And after that? Tomorrow and the next day. 
JACK I can't stay here forever. 
As the words leave his lips he thinks how much he wishes he could. 
JACK (V.O.) It's not that I've given up on life, Father. Just the way that I was living it. If you can call it living. 
CLARA I want always to stay here. 
JACK It's time to go home. 
CLARA Let me come to your home. 
JACK I can't, Clara. One day... 
She's upset but decides not to press her demand. 
JACK (V.O.) If I had one request, Father, it would be this. That it's not Clara who finally pulls the trigger. But whoever it is... 
CLARA kisses him and simply says: 
CLARA Stay forever here. 
JACK (V.O.) ...by this time tomorrow I'll be dead. 
Fade to black. 
FADE IN: 
139   EXT/INT. CHURCH- DAY                                        139 
A POSTMAN hands the mail to FATHER BENEDETTO. 
FATHER BENEDETTO Ciao Fabio, come stai? 
IL POSTINO Bene grazie, Padre. 
We follow FATHER BENEDETTO inside as he rifles through a bunch of church circulars. One LETTER catches his eye. 
He opens it and starts to read aloud: 
FATHER BENEDETTO Dear Father Benedetto. I promised myself that I would write to you- as your friend- to say goodbye... 
140   INT. JACK'S ROOM- DAWN                                      140 
JACK stands by the door in a impeccably pressed suit, the black SAMSONITE BRIEFCASE in his hand. 
He surveys his room. All evidence of his existence has been meticulously tidied away. 
FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.) Everything I've ever done... 
JACK leaves. 
Only thing is left behind: 
The book of MEDIEVAL ITALIAN ART & ARCHITECTURE on the bedside table. 
FATHER BENEDETTO (V.O.) I've done for a reason. 
141   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                        141 
The sun is shining. The mountains young and sharp and beautiful. The CAR moves swiftly across the viaduct that spans a spectacular gorge and plunges into a long tunnel. 
142   INT. CAR- CONTINUOUS                                        142 
JACK watches the road. On the long straights he looks backwards and forwards. 
143   EXT. SERVICE STATION- DAY                                   143 
JACK comes off the autostrada on a slip road and pulls into a forecourt consisting of several rows of Agip and Q8 pumps, a convenience shop, a repair garage and a cafe. 
The car park is not large. JACK parks the Citroen facing the EXIT. There is a single bar across it but this is raised. 
JACK double checks the magazine in his handgun is full and slips his WALTHER into his jacket pocket. 
Stepping out of the car he looks around the car park. It's only a quarter full and ominously quiet. Somewhere in the distance we can hear a sound: creak, creak, creak, creak... 
JACK takes the BRIEFCASE from the rear seat and walks away. He makes a show of locking the car but doesn't. 
As he approaches the CAFE he passes the GARAGE. We see the source of the creak, creak, creaking sound: a SIGN for engine oil, on hinges, revolving slowly in the breeze. 
144   INT. AUTOSTRADA CAFE- DAY                                   144 
Empty. 
MATHILDE Buy yourself a retirement clock. 
Her American accent shows that she's letting her guard down. Maybe it's designed to make JACK do the same. 
It doesn't. 
JACK How do you know I'm retiring? 
She leans forward and kisses him lightly and quickly and on the lips. 
MATHILDE Have you taken your girl up to the meadow yet? 
JACK doesn't answer. His whole body is tense for the bullet that he knows his coming. Perhaps there is a second person in the car. 
Just then... 
...a COACH pulls into the car park. 
It stops with a hydraulic hiss and dozens of TEENAGE KIDS descend. 
MATHILDE looks both irritated and relieved. 
MATHILDE (whispers to JACK) Do it. 
She gets into the driver's seat of the FORD and swings the BRIEFCASE into the back. 
MATHILDE Goodbye, Mr. Butterfly. 
JACK tenses as MATHILDE raises her hand in farewell. 
The FORD pulls away and disappears down the slip road onto the autostrada. 
JACK watches it go. 
Thumbs back the lever on his Walther. 
Gets into his Citroen. 
And opens the ENVELOPE. 
-No wires. 
-No tricks. 
-Just a HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS. 
JACK stares at the money. He isn't supposed to be alive. For a while he stays put. He shuts his eyes in the sunshine and listens to the laughter of the teenage kids. To a girl calling: "Amore!" To the cicadas. To the distant rush of traffic on the autostrada. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
148   EXT. AUTOSTRADA- DAY                                          148 
JACK drives fast... 
...turning off the highway beneath a sign for L'AQUILA. 
149   EXT. L'AQUILA- DAY                                            149 
At the end a small street, JACK parks his car like a true Italian: illegally. 
Runs towards CLARA'S APARTMENT. 
And rings the buzzer. 
No answer. 
JACK rings again. 
Still nothing. 
Shouts up at her window: 
JACK CLARA! 
150   EXT. AUTOSTRADA, CAFE- DAY                                  150 
We're at another roadside service station. 
LARRY comes out of a Kentucky Fried Chicken. 
He climbs into the passenger seat of the FORD. 
MATHILDE drives off. 
151   INT. FORD- DAY                                              151 
LARRY is dusting bread crumbs off his shirt. 
He's about to get his hands dirty and he doesn't like it. 
LARRY Not only did you not kill him, you gave him my fucking money? 
MATHILDE What else could I do? There were kids everywhere. Besides he's suspicious. 
LARRY He's paranoid. That's why I'm paying you the GDP of a small country to get close to him. You could have got him in the sack. You should have got him in the car park. Now you're going to have to take him out long range! 
MATHILDE I prefer it that way. 
She is a trained assassin. She respects JACK. 
MATHILDE The Socimi is the perfect weapon. 
LARRY Let's hope his workmanship is up to scratch. 
He slams a full magazine into the butt of a STERLING SUBMACHINE GUN. 
LARRY Sweden turned Jack into a liability. Three stiffs: two shooters and an innocent civilian. I can't afford a mistake like that again. Europol are crooked but they aren't cheap. Jack's supposed to make me money. Not run up cleaning bills. 
MATHILDE He made short work of the last guy you hired. 
LARRY Never mind Larson. He didn't stand a chance, not against someone as paranoid as Jack. The Swede was only there to take Jack's heat off you. So don't fuck this up again. 
CLARA To live? 
JACK Where else? 
CLARA Forever? 
JACK Forever. 
A pause. 
JACK Unless you have other plans. 
CLARA Other plans? 
She swears in Italian. Obscenities. Then throws herself around JACK and squeezes him with all her strength. There are tears in her eyes. 
CLARA I love you, Signor Eduardo Farfalla. 
He looks at her. 
JACK I... 
162   INSERT:                                                    162 
The TRIGGER FINGER squeezes. 
The SOCIMI SUBMACHINE fires. 
An EXPLOSIVE BULLET travels down the chamber at approximately 360 miles per hour headed straight for JACK's temporal lobe. 
Only it never gets there. 
The gun jams. 
A chamber explosion is a nasty thing. Instead of shooting out of the barrel, the round explodes in the cannon's chamber. 
Hot shrapnel fragments like a land mine, ripping into MATHILDE's hands, forearms and face... 
163   EXT. CASTEL DEL MONTE, TOWN SQUARE- DAY                    163 
A loud BANG pulls JACK and CLARA apart. Amidst the noise of the festival, no one else seems to notice. 
JACK looks in the direction of the HOTEL ROOF. 
CLARA What's happening? 
JACK Someone got what was coming to them. 
He turns to her: 
JACK Go to your apartment and pack. Wait `till I get there. Don't answer the door to anyone but me. 
CLARA Eduardo, please? 
JACK Trust me. 
She looks at him. 
CLARA I trust you. 
She wants to, but she doesn't. 
JACK Clara. My name is not Eduardo. 
CLARA No? 
JACK My name is Jack. 
CLARA Jack. 
She looks worried. 
CLARA You promise you're not married? 
JACK I promise. Take this. 
He hands her an ENVELOPE. It contains his final instalment. 
JACK Look after it. In case. 
CLARA (perplexed) In case? 
He wants to say it but he can't bring himself to. 
In case this is goodbye. 
JACK Now go. 
164   EXT. STREET- DAY                                            164 
LARRY is waiting on the corner of the town square. 
He is dialling and re-dialling a number in his mobile phone, scanning the crowds around him. 
In the two seconds it takes the TAXI to pass by, JACK steps free of a row cars on the other side of the street. 
As LARRY comes into view again, JACK sees the STERLING SUBMACHINE GUN in his hands. 
And LARRY sees JACK. 
LARRY'S FINGER tightens on the trigger. 
L'AMERICANO throws himself to one side. 
There is a quick burst of popping explosions: ripping along the line of parked cars. 
PANIC erupts. 
JACK is about to fire back at LARRY but LARRY takes cover behind a TOURIST and fires back another brief burst. 
JACK is hit in the shoulder. He drops his gun...

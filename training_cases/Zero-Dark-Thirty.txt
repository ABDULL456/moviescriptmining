October 3rd, 2011 
FROM BLACK, VOICES EMERGE-- We hear the actual recorded emergency calls made by World Trade Center office workers to police and fire departments after the planes struck on 9/11, just before the buildings collapsed. 
TITLE OVER: SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 We listen to fragments from a number of these calls...starting with pleas for help, building to a panic, ending with the caller's grim acceptance that help will not arrive, that the situation is hopeless, that they are about to die. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE OVER: TWO YEARS LATER 
INT. BLACK SITE - INTERROGATION ROOM 
DANIEL I own you, Ammar. You belong to me. Look at me. This is DANIEL STANTON, the CIA's man in Islamabad - a big American, late 30's, with a long, anarchical beard snaking down to his tattooed neck. He looks like a paramilitary hipster, a punk rocker with a Glock. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) (explaining the rules) If you don't look at me when I talk to you, I hurt you. If you step off this mat, I hurt you. If you lie to me, I'm gonna hurt you. Now, Look at me. His prisoner, AMMAR, stands on a decaying gym mat, surrounded by four GUARDS whose faces are covered in ski masks. Ammar looks down. Instantly: the guards rush Ammar, punching and kicking. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) Look at me, Ammar. Notably, one of the GUARDS wearing a ski mask does not take part in the beating. 
EXT. BLACK SITE - LATER 
Daniel and the masked figures emerge from the interrogation room into the light of day. They remove their masks and we see that one is a beautiful young woman in her mid-twenties. She has a pale, milky innocence and bright blue eyes, thin and somewhat frail looking, yet possessing a steely core that we will come to realize is off-the-charts. This is MAYA, a CIA targeter and subject-matter expert on her first overseas assignment. 
DANIEL (to the guard) Are we gonna board up these windows or what? 
(TO MAYA) Just off the plane from Washington, you're rocking your best suit for your first interrogation, and then you get this guy. It's not always this intense. 
MAYA I'm fine. She's not. 
DANIEL Just so you know, it's going to take awhile. He has to learn how helpless he is. Let's get a coffee. 
MAYA No, we should go back in. Something about the strange intensity of her expression makes Daniel reconsider and he turns back to the interrogation room. 
DANIEL You know, there's no shame if you wanna watch from the monitor. She shakes her head. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) Alright. At the door, Daniel hands the ski mask back to Maya. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) You might want to put this on. 
MAYA You're not wearing one. Is he ever getting out? 
DANIEL Never. 
CUT TO: 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - LATER 
SUPERIMPOSE: CIA BLACK SITE - UNDISCLOSED LOCATION Ammar, bruised from the beating, is restrained with ropes. Maya stands a few feet behind Daniel, attentive, wary of what is to come. This is her first interrogation and she is on the verge of vomiting from the stench in the room. She looks around at the sound-proofed walls, the puddles of water on the floor. 
DANIEL Right now, this is about you coming to terms with your situation. It's you and me, bro. I want you to understand that I know you, that I've been studying you for a very long time. I could have had you killed Karachi. But I let you live so you and I could talk. 
AMMAR 
(RESISTANT) You beat me when my hands are tied. I won't talk to you. 
DANIEL Life isn't always fair, my friend. Did you really think that when we got you, I'd be a nice fucking guy? 
AMMAR You're a mid-level guy. You're a garbage man in a corporation. Why should I respect you? 
DANIEL And you're a money man. A paperboy! Daniel paces around Ammar, anger rising. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) A disgrace to humanity! 
(MORE) 
DANIEL (CONT'D) You and your uncle murdered three thousand innocent people. I have your name on a five-thousand dollar transfer via Western Union to a 9/11 hijacker. He leans into Ammar's ear. Uncomfortably close. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) And you got popped with 150 kilograms of high explosives in your house! 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - STAIRCASE - ISLAMABAD 
Descending the lobby staircase with Daniel is JOSEPH BRADLEY, Chief of Station, Pakistan, a smooth, vain, sophisticated former case officer who hasn't quite buffed all the blood out of his fingernails. 
BRADLEY How did it go the other night? 
DANIEL It was good. The local cops need tactical help. But he's Tier fucking One, baby. There's your money maker. 
BRADLEY This is the guy that's KSM's nephew? What's his issue? 
DANIEL He's being a dick. 
BRADLEY If he's trying to outsmart you, tell him about your PhD. 
DANIEL I am going to have to turn up the heat. He needs to give us the Saudi group now. They reach the lobby, where they can see Maya sitting in the holding area. They walk towards her as Bradley considers what Daniel is asking for. 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - STAIRCASE/LOBBY 
BRADLEY He's gotta have that - given the family ties. Permission granted, Daniel reassures his boss. 
DANIEL Tight with his uncle, prints all over the 9/11 money. Daniel knocks on the glass for Maya to come in. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) (to Bradley, clocking her good looks) Was I lying or what? The guard opens the door and Maya comes through - not many females come through that door. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) 
(TO MAYA) Maya, this is Joseph Bradley, our illustrious station chief. (as they shake hands) Joe and I did Iraq together. 
BRADLEY And we continue our Christian mission here. Nice to meet you. 
MAYA You too, Sir. 
BRADLEY How was your flight? They walk down the lobby towards the Secure Wing. 
MAYA Fine. 
DANIEL She's been having a great time ever since she got in, isn't that right? 
BRADLEY How do you like Pakistan so far? 
MAYA It's kinda fucked up. 
BRADLEY You volunteered for this didn't you? 
MAYA No. Bradley smiles. He knew she didn't volunteer. They reach a secure area and Bradley checks Maya through an electronic door. 
BRADLEY 
(TO MAYA) Third floor, northeast corner. She goes through and Daniel and Bradley watch her walk away. 
DANIEL Don't you think she's a little young for the hard stuff? 
BRADLEY Washington says she's a killer. 
DANIEL The children's crusade. 
BRADLEY They want the next generation on the field. Listen, I have a meeting with ISI in twenty minutes. 
DANIEL They're slow rolling us in Lahore - you might want to bitch about that. 
BRADLEY Did you see the cable from London? 
DANIEL Dude, I've been in a dark room with another man for the last two days.

Maya finds her desk. It's covered with grime. She tries to clean it as best she can, then sits and looks at the blank log-in screen of her computer. 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY CIA SECTION - CONFERENCE ROOM 
A group of thirty-somethings filing in for a meeting, chatting, comradery, taking seats around a conference table. 
INT. MAYA'S APARTMENT - ISLAMABAD 
The loud WAILING of the early morning call to prayer from the loudspeakers of a nearby mosque wakes Maya on the couch. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BLACK SITE - AFTERNOON 
Daniel and the guards enter Ammar's cell with Maya. Daniel switches on a floodlight, awakening Ammar. 
DANIEL Let's take it easy today, huh? Daniel hands Ammar a bottle of orange juice and a bag of falafel. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) Hungry? The food in here sucks so I got you some of this. Ammar grabs the lunch sack and scarfs down the falafels. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) Richard Reid, wow. I was thinking about him. The guy gets a bomb in his shoe on a plane. Unbelievable. You know him, don't you? Slowly, Ammar nods. 
AMMAR Yes. 
DANIEL I'm glad you said that. I have an email from you to him. I've had all your coms for years, bro. Who else is in your Saudi group? 
AMMAR I just handed out some cash for them. I didn't know who the guys were. 
DANIEL When you lie to me, I hurt you. 
AMMAR Please. 
DANIEL I believe you. I do, I believe you. Beat. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) Do you want the water again, or do you want something else? 
AMMAR Please. 
DANIEL Just give me a name. 
AMMAR 
I DON'T-- Daniel jumps up. 
AMMAR (CONT'D) I don't know. Daniel kicks out the chair from under Ammar. The masked guards walk to the rope pulleys. 
DANIEL You see how this works? You don't mind if my female colleague sees your junk, do you? Daniel pulls down Ammar's pants. Maya flinches at the bare nakedness. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) Dude, you shit your pants. 
Daniel turns to Maya - 
DANIEL (CONT'D) You stay here, I'll be back. Daniel goes out, leaving Maya standing alone in front of the naked, chained man. Ammar looks at her imploringly and she struggles to meet his eyes. 
AMMAR Your friend is an animal. Please, help me. Please. A long beat. 
MAYA You can help yourself by being truthful. The door handle turns. It occurs to Maya that perhaps Daniel was testing her resilience, too, as Daniel re-enters with a DOG COLLAR in his hand. 
DANIEL This is a dog collar. Daniel unhooks Ammar, snaps the collar and leash around his neck, as Ammar cries out against the humiliation. Maya flinches. Daniel is relentless: 
DANIEL (CONT'D) You determine how I treat you. Now Daniel drags Ammar on all fours, pulling him by the leash. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) I'm going to walk you. Maya watches in horror as Daniel walks Ammar to a far corner of the room, then leans down to address his victim: 
DANIEL (CONT'D) What the fuck do you think is going on, Ammar? Wahleed has already told me that you know. At last, Daniel reaches an area of the room where there is a large wooden box resting on a platform. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) This box sucks. I'm going to put you in it. Ammar tries to speak but can't get a word out. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) When is the attack? 
AMMAR 
(VERY SOFTLY) Sunday. 
DANIEL Sunday? Sunday where? This Sunday or next Sunday? Ammar mumbles, almost inaudibly. 
AMMAR Monday. 
DANIEL Is it Sunday or Monday? Ammar doesn't answer. The masked men approach. 
MAYA After we kept you awake for 96 hours, you gave us names of some of your brothers and saved the lives of a lot of innocent people. 
DANIEL Which is the smart thing to do, you're starting to think for yourself. Ammar is lost. But the food is tempting. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) Eat up! You earned it. Ammar eats. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) So you flew via Amman to Kabul to hang out with your uncle? Mukhtar. 
AMMAR How did you know that? 
DANIEL I told you man, I know you. Alright, you got me - flight manifests. It must've been pretty fucked up for you guys after 9/11. What did you do after the invasion and before you went back to Pesh? 
AMMAR After 9/11 I had to choose: fight, to protect our turf - or run. 
DANIEL 
(SYMPATHETIC) You chose to fight. Ammar looks Daniel right in the eyes. 
AMMAR I wanted to kill Americans. We tried to get into Tora Bora but the bombing was too high. We couldn't cross. 
MAYA Sorry, who is the "we" in that sentence? 
AMMAR Me and some guys who were hanging around at that time. 
DANIEL 
(CASUALLY) I can eat with some other dude and hook you back up to the ceiling? 
AMMAR Hamza Rabia, Khabab al-Masri, and Abu Ahmed. Maya makes notes on her pad. 
MAYA Who's Abu Ahmed? I've heard of the other guys. 
AMMAR He was a computer guy with us at the time. After Tora Bora, I went back to Pesh - as you know - and he went North, I think, to Kunar. 
MAYA What's his family name? 
AMMAR Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. 
MAYA Abu Ahmed means "father of Ahmed", it's a kunya. 
(MORE) 
MAYA (CONT'D) Ammar, I know the difference between a war name and an Arabic name. 
DANIEL She got you there, dude. 
AMMAR I swear to you both: I don't know his family name. I would have never asked him something like that. It's not how my uncle worked. My uncle told me he worked for bin Laden. I did see him, once, about a year ago, in Karachi. He read us all a letter from the Sheikh. 
MAYA A letter? 
DANIEL What did it say? Daniel offers Ammar a smoke. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) Cigarette? Ammar accepts. Daniel's lights it. 
AMMAR It said "Continue the jihad. The work will go on for a hundred years." 
CUT TO: 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - RESEARCH ROOM 
We fade into a dimly lit research room, where Maya is alone watching interrogation video recordings on an array of monitors. Some of the videos are rough; but most simply depict two people talking. The video she's watching now shows a hooded prisoner sitting in a filthy room, the walls smeared with red stains. 
CU SCREEN: 
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR You and I are gonna talk about some of the guys in the training camps, yeah? The prisoner sits in a chair. He's hooded, but relaxed. 
PRISONER Ok. 
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR Some of these brothers have done some bad things, and what I want to do is I want to separate them from the people like you. 
PRISONER Definitely, yeah. 
SOLDIER INTERROGATOR There was a guy called Abu Ahmed from Kuwait. 
INTERROGATOR How many other people? 
PRISONER 
(THINKING) Four or five. 
INTERROGATOR Let's talk about them-- The image freezes. Maya stares at the screen. 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - KITCHEN 
Maya is in the kitchen grabbing something to eat. Jessica, the only other person working this late, walks in, pours herself some coffee. 
JESSICA How's the needle in the haystack? 
MAYA Fine. 
JESSICA Facilitators come and go, but one thing you can count on in life is that everyone wants money. The rivalry is in full bloom. Sometimes it's friendly. Sometimes it's not so friendly. 
MAYA 
(SMILING) You're assuming that Al Qaeda members are motivated by financial rewards. They're radicals. 
JESSICA 
(BIGGER SMILE) Correct. You're assuming that greed won't override ideology in some of the weaker members. 
MAYA Money for walk-ins worked great in the cold war, I'll give you that. 
JESSICA Thank you. 
MAYA Just not sure those tactics are applicable to the Middle East.

EXT. WARSAW SHIPYARD - POLAND - DAY 
SUPERIMPOSE: CIA BLACK SITE - WARSAW, POLAND A sprawling shipyard in an industrial area. A large MILITARY FRIGATE sits in the harbor. A dark haired WOMAN and a MAN board the ship. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FRIGATE - BLACK SITE - POLAND - DAY 
At first we don't recognize the woman with heavy makeup walking down the narrow corridor, and then we realize it's Maya in disguise. She enters a vast cavernous hold accompanied by a middle aged Afghan man, thick shouldered with years of hard experience in his kind, somewhat sad eyes. This fatherly man is HAKIM, a former political prisoner in Afghanistan and one of the CIA's most important assets. In the galley, a PRISONER is chained to a table. Hakim slides him The Photograph. The prisoner speaks in Arabic. 
HAKIM 
(TRANSLATING) He says he looks like Abu Ahmed. 
MAYA Who did he work for? Hakim translates. Then the prisoner speaks. 
HAKIM 
(TRANSLATING) It was mostly with Abu Faraj - they were always together. 
MAYA What did he do for Faraj? 
HAKIM 
(TRANSLATING) He carried messages from Faraj to bin Laden and from bin Laden back to Faraj. Maya leans into Hakim - 
MAYA We need to ask him something to see if he's telling the truth. We don't know if he really knew Faraj. Hakim speaks to the prisoner. 
HAKIM He just told me the names of all of Faraj's children. I think he's telling the truth. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - CIA SECTION 
FARAJ A month ago, in Karachi, but I don't know where he is now. Sometimes I wouldn't even see him, he would just tell me where to leave the messages. 
MAYA I don't believe you. The GUARD in the room with them leans forward and SLAPS Faraj across the face. Faraj's expression doesn't change and Maya herself remains flat and steady, unmoved by the violence. She's not quite the same young lady she was a few years ago. 
MAYA (CONT'D) You're not being fulsome in your replies. 
FARAJ You can't force me to tell you something I don't know. 
MAYA You do realize this is not a normal prison. You determine how you are treated, and your life will be very uncomfortable until you give me information I need. The guard slaps Faraj again. Faraj is impassive.

EXT. BLACK SITE - PRE-DAWN 
Maya walks around the facility, quiet at this hour, and finds another insomniac, Daniel, by the monkey cage. The cage is empty. 
MAYA Faraj is completely denying knowing Abu Ahmed, and that's using every measure we have. 
DANIEL He's either going to withhold or die from the pressure you're putting on him. 
MAYA Do you want to take a run at him? 
DANIEL No. 
MAYA No? Since when? 
DANIEL You know, I've been meaning to tell you: I'm getting outta here. 
MAYA What? You okay? 
DANIEL I'm fine. I've just seen too many guys naked. It's gotta be over a hundred at this point. I need to go do something normal for awhile. 
MAYA Like what? 
DANIEL Go to Washington, do the dance, see how that environment works. 
(BEAT) You should come with me. Be my number two. You're looking a little strung out yourself. Maya looks at Dan. No longer the man he once was. She doesn't hide her disappointment. 
MAYA I'm not going to find Abu Ahmed from 
D.C. They both look at the empty cage, clocking the irony. 
DANIEL They killed my monkeys. Something about an escape. Can you fucking believe that? 
MAYA Sorry, Dan. 
DANIEL Look, Maya, you gotta be really careful with detainees now. The politics are changing and you don't want to be the last one holding a dog collar when the oversight committee comes. 
MAYA I know. 
DANIEL And watch your back when you get back to Pakistan. Everyone knows you there now. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ISLAMABAD - NIGHT 
Back in Pakistan, the country has indeed changed to a more militarized police state, and as we establish the new environment, we find Maya's grey sedan... 
EXT. ISLAMABAD - NEAR THE MARRIOTT HOTEL - NIGHT 
The car pulls up to a checkpoint manned by PAKISTANI POLICE. The Policeman look at the car - look at the plate - the plate is diplomatic - they walk around the car and stop at the window - shine their bright light right into Maya's eyes. A POLICEMAN motions for her to roll down her window. 
FATALLY.

INT. TRIBAL VILLAGE HUT 
Now we are inside a hut and we've shifted to the perspective of a hand held camera, as if someone inside this stone age interior is filming on our behalf, and we see a hard floor, thin gaps in the walls, and FIVE TRIBAL ELDERS talking casually, eating and drinking tea. 
We pan across the weathered faces, long beards, and see a video recorder resting on a ledge.

JESSICA The Jords have a mole! 
MAYA What? Jessica pops a CD into Maya's computer, loads a file that plays the same video clip we have just seen. 
JESSICA He made this video to prove his bona fides. 
MAYA Shut the fuck up! The camera stops on one man, BALAWI. 
JESSICA 
(POINTING) Humam Khalil al-Balawi, he's a Jordanian doctor. He's really motivated. Maya practically bolts out of her chair. Together, they start walking towards Bradley's office - 
MAYA This could be it! 
JESSICA This is it.

CONTINUOUS Bradley has just finished watching the video. Maya and Jessica are in his office waiting for his verdict. 
JESSICA He's right there in the inner circle. 
BRADLEY I don't buy it. Didn't you tell me yourself nobody turns on Al Qaeda? 
JESSICA The Jords worked him for a year. Dinners, money. They've convinced him that it's his patriotic duty to turn on Al Qaeda and get rich doing it. 
BRADLEY Yeah, so the Jords say. 
MAYA 
(TO BRADLEY) You're right. We can't rely on the Jords. We have to evaluate him face to face. 
INT. DINING AREA 
Jessica pours two glasses of wine and raises a toast to her colleague, JOHN. 
JESSICA Not to get technical, but this guy is actually the first big break we've had since 9/11. To big breaks and the little people that make them happen. Clink. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) So far, everything he's said we've cross checked and it's proved legit... and I think the money is persuasive. 25 million dollars?! That buys a new life. 
JOHN Do you think he might be exaggerating his access? 
JESSICA Possibly. But Al Qaeda needs doctors and they are short staffed and that could explain his rise. In six months to a year, if he doesn't fuck up, he could be called in to treat bin Laden. And at that moment, with 25 mil on the table, I think he gives up the Big Man. And if he doesn't, we kill him.

JESSICA So John? (John turns to her) When he arrives, I'll set the tone, and then I'll flip it to you - and you'll talk about asset protection. 
JOHN Roger that. 
JESSICA Then Lauren, I know you want to get some questions in there - but give Balawi time after John speaks. We'll cover the basics and have his birthday cake, then we'll get to the nitty gritty. 
Jessica turns to Zied. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) Is that order okay, or do you want to introduce everyone? 
ZIED I'll introduce you, and you introduce your team. He knows this is a high level meeting. 
SECURTY GUARD Quick question: all is taking place inside our main building? 
JESSICA Right. And Lauren? Washington will want real time updates so please stay on top of that. Be concise. The Director is in the loop. And I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't update the President. 
LAUREN Yeah, I'm on it. They take in the possibilities.

Several hundred yards before the Camp entrance is a beat-up SEDAN. The car pulls up to the checkpoint but doesn't proceed. 
JESSICA (to the Security Gyard) Why are there gate guards there? We talked about this, no one is supposed to be there when my source arrives. You might have spooked him already! 
SECURTY GUARD Procedures only work if we follow them every time. 
JESSICA This time is different - I'm sorry I can't explain, but it's for a good cause. 
SECURTY GUARD Look, I'm responsible for everyone's safety, okay? It's not just about you. 
JESSICA I just need them to go away for a minute. You can search him as soon as he gets here. The Security Guard pauses, then into his radio: 
SECURTY GUARD 
(INTO RADIO) All stations, go ahead and stand down. 
CHECKPOINT GUARD 
(OVER RADIO) Roger.

DANIEL Is this a Balboni? Fuck me. This is nice. What are you thinking? 
KUWAITI BUSINESSMAN I think I'll choose this one. The salesman retreats to a back office. 
DANIEL That's a nice choice, my friend. Daniel gives the Kuwaiti a slip of paper. 
KUWAITI MAN Who is it?

MAYA How come you haven't deployed a team to stay in Rawalpindi? 
LARRY For one thing, it's dangerous. For another, the area is too congested for us to be effective without some predictive intelligence. 
MAYA That's why you should forward deploy - so you can shorten your response time. 
LARRY Still, it wouldn't work. 
MAYA Why? 
LARRY The guy never stays on the phone long enough. 
MAYA You haven't tried. 
LARRY Look, I don't have the personnel. 
MAYA That's bullshit. 
LARRY As it is, my guys don't get any sleep tracking the threats within Pakistan. Larry pushes past her to leave, and she follows him.

We focus on a MAP of Pakistan on the wall. Maya is indicating neighborhoods in Rawalpindi. She's briefing Bradley, Hakim, Larry and a few other people. 
MAYA It would be convenient for him to drop tapes off if he's sending either from bin Laden or from an intermediary. When he wants to make a call, he leaves the house, walks a few blocks, then switches on the phone. We need to keep canvassing the neighborhood until we find him.

Hakim gets out of the car and walks toward the men. We can't hear what they're saying. At last, Hakim comes back to the car. 
INT. MINIVAN 
HAKIM They said white faces don't belong here. If they don't move, shoot them. A tense beat while the men stare, then finally leave.

INT. SUV 
In the backseat, the Computer Tech is getting tossed around, trying to hang onto the Geo Locating device in his lap. The Geo Locator starts to BEEP - a blinking red light. 
COMPUTER TECH He's east of us. Try the market. 
EXT./INT. MINIVAN 
The congestion thickens. They slow to a crawl. The SUV, stuck in traffic. Can't move. Larry leaps out of the car and heads into an open air market - 
EXT. OPEN AIR MARKET - PESHAWAR - CONTINUOUS 
(PAUSE) Weaker now, he's shifted. We're back to five. I don't get it. 
LARRY He's driving in circles. Larry now drives very fast back to the main road. 
LARRY (CONT'D) No change? 
TECH No. 
MAIN ROAD And now Larry stops in the middle of the market. 
LARRY Let's hope he comes back around. Beat. 
TECH Twenty. Thirty. Forty! Fifty - we're within ten meters of him. Larry scans the street - sees a half dozen guys on cell phones. 
TECH (CONT'D) He's really close. 
LARRY Look at the cars. He's in a vehicle. Larry spots something: 
LARRY (CONT'D) The guy with the phone in the white 
SUV. They snap a photograph of a WHITE POTAHAR SUV. 
LARRY (CONT'D) Is that him? 
TECH Could be. 
LARRY You got him? 
TECH I got him. 
LARRY I'm breaking off - The grey minivan pulls away.

MAYA Is this what I think it is? 
LARRY The guy you've been looking for, geo- located on his cell phone in his white car. 
MAYA Thank you! 
LARRY If you're right, the whole world's gonna want in on this, so you gotta stick to your guns now.

ALEXANDER 
(INTO PHONE) I'm amazed that you're still here. (looks at his watch, 
INTO PHONE) When can we grab lunch? He sees that Maya, who hovers annoyingly over his desk, isn't gonna wait. 
MAYA I need a picket line along the GT highway and men spaced at intervals along the road and at every exit. 
ALEXANDER Maya, I know - 
MAYA So you agree with me now. This is important? 
ALEXANDER No, I've just learned from my predecessor that life is better when I don't disagree with you.

A two lane highway. Tucked on the side of the road is an OLD MAN with a cart of mangoes. 
MAYA (V.O.) Our current hypothesis is that he lives somewhere along the highway, in one of the towns, or a medium sized city called Abbottabod, or up near Kashmir. ECU: mango cart. Nestled among the fruit is a BLACK RADIO. 
COMPOUND. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS PREDATOR BAY - LANGLEY - EVENING 
The Langley Predator Bay is an impressive sight, a command center bristling with high-tech equipment. The room is filled with TECHNICIANS. George is in the center, where he belongs, directing traffic. People come up and give him new pieces of information. The big screen displays a single image: The overhead satellite image of the compound in Abbottabod. 
SUPERIMPOSE: PREDATOR BAY - CIA HEADQUARTERS From the back of the room, Maya enters, and watches the activity unfold without her... without her input. George notices her, gives a thumbs up and then turns back to his troops. STEVE, early 40s, a senior manager and one of George's top deputies, joins Maya. 
STEVE Basically we had a guy who rolled with Al Qaeda and did services for them. We lost him for seven years and now we found him again -- and boy does he have a really nice house. Is that it? 
MAYA Pretty much. 
STEVE Okay, let's go talk to the boss. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LANGLEY BRIEFING ROOM 
Maya and Steve are the first to arrive in the wood panelled conference room. A detailed TABLE TOP MODEL of the compound sits in the center of the conference table, right next to a poster-sized satellite image of the compound. She starts to sit in one of the chairs. 
STEVE 
(GENTLE) You should sit back there...sorry. Steve points her to the back of the room. 
STEVE (CONT'D) They're gonna ask: if bin Laden is at the end of this rainbow - is the Pak military with him? 
MAYA The question isn't are the Paks protecting bin Laden?' 
(MORE) 
MAYA (CONT'D) The question is, 'would he allow himself to be protected by the Paks?' I mean, why would he trust them? He tried to kill Musharaf. Steve considers a reply, but the meeting principals are filing in, including Daniel, and when Steve sees the CIA DIRECTOR enter the room, he clears the head of the table. 
CIA DIRECTOR Go ahead. 
STEVE If you take a right out of Islamabad and drive about forty-five minutes North, you'll find yourself here in Abbottabad. A middle class community - some ex-military - not particularly interesting to us. Except we did find this compound, which is unique. We got a sixteen foot wall around the entire perimeter, the windows are blacked out. It's a fortress. 
CIA DIRECTOR Can't you put a camera somewhere - in the trees - to get a look into the main house? 
GEORGE It will probably be discovered. 
CIA DIRECTOR We have to get a look into the house. The Director moves to the satellite image. 
CIA DIRECTOR (CONT'D) Alright, what's this? This cluster of buildings down here. 
GEORGE The PMA - The Pakistan Military Academy. It's their West Point. 
CIA DIRECTOR And how close is that to the house? 
GEORGE About a mile. A WOMAN'S voice from the back of the room. 
MAYA O.S. 4,221 feet. It's closer to eight- tenths of a mile. 
CIA DIRECTOR Who are you? 
MAYA I'm the motherfucker that found this place, Sir. The boss studies her for a moment then turns back to the model. 
CIA DIRECTOR I want to know more about who's inside this house by the end of the week. The brass files out, leaving Steve and Maya. 
STEVE "Motherfucker?" Really? 
CUT TO: 
INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - AF/PAK DIVISION - DAY 
Maya sits at her desk, frustrated, then walks down the aisle of cubicles to the glass wall of George's office. She grabs a red marker. 
MAYA (through the glass) Morning, George. In red magic marker, Maya writes the number 21 on the glass. Then circles it. George looks up. 
MAYA (CONT'D) Twenty-one days. It's been twenty- one days since we found the house and nothing's happened! 
INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - PREDATOR BAY - NIGHT 
GEORGE If there are three females, there ought to be three males. Observant Muslim women either live with parents or with their husbands. We think there's a third family living in the house. 
SUPERIMPOSE: SITUATION ROOM - THE WHITE HOUSE 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR So this third male that you've identified as possibly being bin Laden, do I just give up all hope of ever seeing a photograph of him? 
GEORGE Hope? Hope is not a targeting layer. You give up your hope right now. We scanned for heat signatures, but we can't validate if it's a man or a woman up there. We found a safe house, but we can't get a vantage point to fire a telescope over the balcony wall. 
EXT. COMPOUND - ABBOTTABAD - MORNING 
A DOCTOR comes to the compound offering immunizations. One of the women let's him in, and he offers polio vaccines to the children. 
GEORGE We talked about burrowing a pin hole camera but there's a high risk of discovery. 
(MORE) 
GEORGE (CONT'D) We have explored the possibility of digging tunnels, of sending hot air balloons, of re-routing supply C- 130's to take a peek, but that might be too alerting. We've looked for ways of collecting available DNA from his trash - you know, looking for his toothbrush, but they burn the trash. We started a vaccination program, we sent a doctor to the house, to see if he could pull blood. A lady in a black burkha rushes out and angrily shoos the doctor away. 
GEORGE (CONT'D) That didn't work out. We thought about sending a guy with a bucket to pull a sample from the sewer to analyze his fecal matter. 
SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR What was wrong with that, exactly? He looks up. 
GEORGE What was wrong with that? The sample would be too diluted. 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR And it's asking too much to get a voice confirmation with him on the phone? 
GEORGE They don't make telephone calls from the compound. We pulled the cell tower nearby. 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR And I'm also going to give up hope that he might ever get in that white SUV and drive around a bit and we could see him? Don't they get groceries. 
GEORGE The unidentified third male does not get groceries. He does not leave the compound. He does not present himself for photographs. 
(MORE) 
GEORGE (CONT'D) When he needs fresh air, he paces around beneath a grape arbor, but the leaves are so thick they obscure our satellite views. This is a professional attempt to avoid detection - real tradecraft. The only people we've seen behave this way are other top level Al Qaeda operatives. The National Security Advisor nods to his Special Assistant who slides a big folder across his desk to George. 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR We did a Red Team on your analysis. According to them, this behavior could belong to someone other than Al Qaeda. 
DEPUTY NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR They did give a forty percent chance that the unidentified third man is a senior Al Qaeda operative. But they also said there's a thirty-five percent chance he's a Saudi drug 
DEALER (reading from the 
BINDER) A fifteen percent chance that he's a Kuwaiti arms smuggler, a ten percent chance that he's one of the relatives of the brothers. 
SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO THE ADVISOR Basically, we agree with you, the house screams security, it screams someone who wants privacy, it even screams 'bad guy', but it does not scream bin Laden. 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR You get the point. 
(BEAT) If you can't prove it's bin Laden, at least prove it's not somebody else, like a drug dealer. Beat. The meeting is adjourned. As they walk out -- 
GEORGE You know we lost our ability to prove that when we lost the detainee program. 
(BEAT) Who the hell am I supposed to ask? Some guy in Gitmo who is all lawyered up? He'll just tell his lawyer to warn bin Laden. 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR You'll think of something. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - AF/PAK DIVISION - DAY 
Maya is back at George's office, keeping track of time for us by writing each passing day on the window of George's office. We watch as she erases the numbers in red and writes new ones. 78. Time passes.

CUT TO: 
INT. WHITE HOUSE - NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL S.C.I.F. - DAY 
The same group around the same conference table. 
GEORGE He'd be the first successful drug dealer never to have dealt drugs. He has no internet access to the house. He makes no phone calls either in or out. Who's he selling to, who's he buying from, how's he making his money? And if you're going to say he's retired, I'd say where's his swimming pool, where's the gold cage with the falcons? And why does he send his courier to the two cities in Pakistan we most associate with Al Qaeda, that have nothing particularly to do with heroin production? The National Security Advisor taps his pencil impatiently. 
NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR The President is a thoughtful, analytical guy. He needs proof. 
INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - CAFETERIA - DAY 
George is pulling his tray away from the food service court when Maya ambushes him. 
MAYA We've spun up the SEALs - we've done everything humanly possible to collect on the compound, and the collection is not going to get any better. 
GEORGE We have to keep working it. 
MAYA You're going to come into work one day, and there's going to be a black moving van and a 'for sale' sign in front of that compound. George drops his tray down. 
GEORGE Maya, you didn't prove it. 
INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - 7TH FLOOR - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Sitting around the table are the CIA Director, JEREMY, Wolf, the DEPUTY DIRECTOR, George, Daniel, Steve and a few other people we don't know. At the far end of the table are back benchers, including Maya. 
CIA DIRECTOR I'm about to go look the President in the eye and what I'd like to know, no fucking bullshit, is where everyone stands on this thing. Now, very simply. Is he there or is he not fucking there? He looks to the Deputy Director. 
DEPUTY DIRECTOR We all come at this through the filter of our own past experiences. I remember Iraq WMD very clearly, I fronted that and I can tell you the case for that was much stronger than this case. 
CIA DIRECTOR Yes or no. 
DEPUTY DIRECTOR We don't deal in certainty, we deal in probability. I'd say there's a sixty percent probability he's there. The CIA Director points to Wolf. 
WOLF I concur. Sixty percent. 
GEORGE I'm at eighty percent. Their OPSEC is what convinces me. 
CIA DIRECTOR You guys ever agree on anything? 
DANIEL Well, I agree with sixty, we're basing this mostly on detainee reporting and I spent a bunch of time in those rooms - who knows? Maya shoots Daniel a look. What a traitor. 
DANIEL (CONT'D) I'd say it's a soft sixty, sir. I'm virtually certain there's some high value target there, I'm just not sure it's bin Laden. The CIA Director leans back in his chair. 
CIA DIRECTOR This is a cluster-fuck, isn't it? 
JEREMY I'd like to know what Maya thinks. 
DEPUTY DIRECTOR We're all incorporating her assessment into ours. Maya can't take it anymore: 
MAYA One hundred percent, he's there - okay, fine, ninety-five percent because I know certainty freaks you guys out - but it's a hundred! 
INT. CIA HEADQUARTERS - 7TH FLOOR - HALLWAY 
The CIA Director walks with Jeremy towards the elevator. 
CIA DIRECTOR They're all cowed. What do you think of the girl? 
JEREMY I think she's fucking smart. As the door closes. 
CIA DIRECTOR We're all smart, Jeremy. 
INT. LANGELY CAFETERIA 
Maya is eating lunch by herself when she's startled to see the CIA Director standing by her table. 
CIA DIRECTOR May I join you? She nods, gulps. 
CIA DIRECTOR (CONT'D) 
(SITTING) How long have you worked for the 
CIA? 
MAYA Twelve years. I was recruited out of high school. 
CIA DIRECTOR Do you know why we did that? 
MAYA I don't think I can answer that question, sir. I don't think I'm allowed to answer. 
CIA DIRECTOR What else have you done for us besides bin Laden? 
MAYA Nothing. I've done nothing else. He evaluates her... weighing her certainty against his decades of Washington experience.

The second helo passes over but a storm of debris and garbage from the rooftop creates another flight risk and the helo banks away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COMPOUND - FIRST GATE 
Patrick, Justin and SIX other SEALs cluster near the First Gate in the animal pen. One of the SEALs places a charge on the gate, while others check the Prayer Room. Boom! The charge partially blows open the metal swing doors of the gate, leaving a very narrow gap. Not ideal. The SEALs muscle and squeeze their way through the narrow opening in the jagged metal as the SNIPER climbs up on the roof of the prayer room. 
EXT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT 
Patrick and Jared arrive at the guest house but can't see inside - the windows and doors are covered with sheets. Patrick kneels down to place a charge at the front door handle when the door erupts with gunfire - Bullets fly out of the wooden door. One skims Patrick's shoulder as he kneels lower. Patrick fires back at the house, putting a dozen rounds inside. A moment passes. They wait for a response. The door handle unlocks. ABU AHMED'S WIFE appears at the doorway and walks out. 
JARED Ir-fah ee-dek! 
ABU AHMED'S WIFE 
(IN ENGLISH) You killed him. 
INT. GUEST HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Piercing the first floor darkness with their infra red lights, the SEALs advance slowly into the first floor hallway. Piles of household clutter, stacked high in bizarre shapes, greet them like the innards of a haunted house. One of the SEAL's catches movement: A figure with an AK-47 scrambling through clutter, then disappearing around a corner.

The EOD SEAL slides into the belly of Prince 51. While he places charges, another SEAL climbs up to affix charges to the roof and rotors ...and like a tight roper, he walks out on the tail of the helicopter, when suddenly his foot slips, piercing the tail's thin skin, and he nearly falls off. He manages to place a last charge - but the remainder of the tail piece will not be detonated.

(SUPERED OVER BOTTOM OF SCREEN LIKE A TV NEWS BULLETIN) 
(THE FILM IS IN COLOR UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED.) 
A darkened diffused image of a man lying on the ground. A tree is above him. The image is more diffused on the edges. It is black and white, and appears to be coming from a television. The body of the man is practically totally in shadow. 
ANNOUNCERS VOICE Ladies and gentlemen, on the new tonight, the first actual motion pictures of death. 
A small orange fire appears in the breast of the man. 
ANNOUNCERS VOICE Watch closely, at the moment of death. 
The small orange fire fades away. 
COLOR CHARLES CAPPA JR. (CHARLIE) is 25 of Sicilain origin. He was educated in Roman Catholic Parochial schools with one year and a half at a Jesuit college. CHARLIE was raised sternly in the Roman Catholic tradition but now has rejected many of the religion's tenets. He is very intelligent and has a sharp sense of humor. He is always well dressed. His favorite authors are Ernest Hemingway, Thomas Hardy, and Theodore Dreiser. He likes reading but enjoys films more. He is very fond of the New Testament and often exchanges quotes from it with his friend TONY. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CHARLIE has been dreaming. The dream frightened him. A TITLE APPEARS on the bottom of the frame: CHARLIE. He gets up to look at his face in the mirror. His room is lit by moonlight. It is a small tenement bedroom with a fire- escape outside. 
He returns to bed and as his head hits the pillow, we hear the RONETTES singing "BE MY BABY." 
CUT TO: 
An 8-mm. projector whirring away. 
INT. PARTY - HOME MOVIES - DAY 
Opening TITLES appear over 8mm. HOME MOVIES in which CHARLIE is shown along with his friends and family in a celebration...a sense of "one big unending party." 
During this opening segment WE SEE some of the characters that will later appear in the story: JOHNNY BOY, MICHAEL, TONY, TERESA, CHARLIE'S UNCLE GIOVANNI, and others. They are all Sicilian and are members of the same Italian- American neighborhood in New York City. (WE SENSE, from these HOME MOVIES, that the neighborhood forces its people to be strongly tied together in a way of life - Family, Church, Friendship.) These HOME MOVIES were taken during some formal and casual gatherings in which CHARLIE participated. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM IN A NEIGHBORHOOD BAR 
A longhaired "freak" is about to shoot-up. Suddenly the door opens and TONY (ANTHONY DEVENZIANO) comes in. TONY is totally different in appearance and dress from the "freak." He is 25, and a part time student studying liberal arts. His father is a very powerful racketeer in a different part of the city and owns several night club type discotheques and strip houses on the west side of town. One of these is operated by TONY - "TONY'S PLACE." CHARLIE is one of his closest friends. TONY is well dressed, flippant and reckless. He is a big drinker, liquor, wine, and even cough medicine. 
TONY What the fuck...hey! 
TONY rushes over to the "freak", who is too strung out to defend himself, smashes the needle, and slaps him around. 
TONY Not in my fuckin' place... get out... get out! 
INT. BAR AREA 
TONY pushes him out the door and into the bar area. There are a few people in the bar...mainly neighborhood guys like TONY. A few "freaks" are in the BG. 
TONY pushes him out the front door. 
TONY And keep the fuck out-a-here. I know your face. 
TONY crosses over to one of the neighborhood guys by the bar and slaps him in the back of the head knocking off his hat. 
TONY And you scumbag...what did I tell you 'bout passin' that shit in my PLACE (HITS AGAIN) ...huh? 
BOY Hey I didn't do nothin'...cut it out... 
TONY is at the bar. He is approached by GEORGE one of the bouncers. He seems upset about the noise that CHARLIE and his friends are creating. TONY doesn't take GEORGE very seriously. 
GEORGE It's ten o'clock and they're like this. And they're just starting? 
TONY smiles. 
GEORGE (CONTINUING) Smile...What are you smiling at? This is a business night. 
TONY (INTERRUPTING) George...did I ever tell you the story about the three chickens? 
GEORGE (GENUINELY) No... 
TONY Too bad. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CHARLIE's zany behavior as frenetically as it occurs. There is no particular logical sequence except that events are suited to the rythmic pattern of the music. 
1. CHARLIE and his friends dance and sing along with the music. 
2. CHARLIE picks up a billiard stick. He attempts to hit a filled shot glass towards TONY at the other end of the bar. He fails. 
3. CHARLIE tries to pull a tablecloth off of a stranger's table without moving the glasses or bottles. This also fails. 
4. A punch is thrown at someone. A lit cigarette in the puncher's fist creates a swift arc of light in the darkness. 
5. The Strippers finally appear on stage. CHARLIE becomes obsessed with the Negro stripper DIANE. He shouts to her, tosses things, and calls her names. She tries, half amusedly to ignore him but she can't. 
6. TONY drinks from a bottle of Southern Comfort, and as a chaser swigs down Aqua Velva. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CHARLIE sitting at an empty table watching DIANE, the stripper, perform again. He stares glassy-eyed and then begins to speak softly, continuing his Confession. 
CHARLIE Y'know...she's really good-looking... really good-looking. I've gotta say that again. She's really good- looking...but she's black... You can see that real plain. (as an afterthought) When you get down to it though... there's not much of a difference, is there? (He waits for an answer) Well...is there? (He smiles and begins chewing on an ice cube from his half EMPTY GLASS) 
Suddenly MICHAEL appears and sits down at CHARLIE's table. He hands CHARLIE two cartons of cigarettes. 
CHARLIE Oh great...hey - Winstons? 
MICHAEL For these prices don't be particular. That's all they had - but next week we'll see... 
CHARLIE gives him the money. 
CHARLIE OK, ok... 
MICHAEL Sell 'em if you can't smoke them. 
CHARLIE No...I'll be ok for a week. 
MICHAEL You seen Johnny Boy tonight? 
CHARLIE (DISINTERESTED) Nope... 
MICHAEL Isn't he supposed to be here tonight...I mean... 
CHARLIE Look...I don't know. What am I supposed to be, his keeper or something? Yeah, he's supposed to be here but who knows what goes on in his head. Right? 
MICHAEL I'd like to know Charlie, it looks like your little friend is trying to duck me... 
CHARLIE remains silent. 
MICHAEL (CONTINUING) ...Charlie, don't you think you should be interested in Johnny's payments to me? I think you should be, you know that. 
CHARLIE (QUIETLY) Michael, nobody's out to screw you, I guarrantee that. 
MICHAEL I know that Charlie but look at my side. You undersigned the loans. You vouched for him. What happens if this kid don't pay me? I gotta collect from you? I don't want to do that. I made a deal with him not you, right? 
SAL Hey Johnny, where're you goin'? 
JOHNNY BOY Sal!... fourteen street. 
SAL Come on. 
INT. INSIDE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 
JOHNNY BOY This is some boat. Your father's? 
SAL Yeah...just had it delivered... 
JOHNNY BOY Hey... you got stereo. 
SAL Yeah, I think so. 
As JOHNNY BOY admires the gadgets in the car he notices that SAL is becoming very nervous. 
JOHNNY BOY You got a speaker back there? 
He turns to look for the speaker and sees a police car not far behind. 
JOHNNY BOY (CONTINUING) Ah...there's a funny lookin' cab behind us. 
SAL (NERVOUSLY) I know...I know. 
JOHNNY BOY What'sa matter...forget your registration? 
SAL No...no. Nooo...it's just that I...I...uh... this ain't my car. 
JOHNNY BOY Yeah, it's your father's. 
SAL Well...no. 
JOHNNY BOY You mean it's heisted. 
SAL You could say that. 
JOHNNY BOY (announcing it loudly) This is a heisted car! 
SAL smiles sheepishly. JOHNNY BOY panics. 
EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON 
The police switch on their flashing red light and try to get closer to them but the traffic is too heavy. 
SAL manages to turn the next corner at about twenty miles per hour. 
INT. INSIDE CAR - LATE AFTERNOON 
JOHNNY BOY frightened now, underestimates the speed of the car and quickly opens the door. 
EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON 
JOHNNY BOY tumbles from the car only to smack into a lamp- post. He has seriously banged his head and blood is running down his face. But because of the near proximity of the police car he is desperately trying to maintain an air of dignity as he calmly tries to walk down the street. 
END FLASHBACK 
CUT TO: 
INT. TONY'S PLACE - NIGHT 
TONY has now joined the group sitting at the table... CHARLIE and TONY nod in disbelief. 
JOHNNY BOY It's the truth, I swear. 
CHARLIE All right, forget it. Tony, you got anything we can put on his face? 
MICHAEL Where should I drop you Charlie? 
SAMMY (interrupting the conversation) Yes Charlie, your place or mine. 
BENTON Sammy. 
CHARLIE Away from the neighborhood. 
SAMMY Oh Benton...look! 
SAMMY leans over JOHNNY and CHARLIE to see out the window. He begins to shout at a young boy on the street. 
SAMMY (CONTINUING) Hi beautiful!!! I love you. 
CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY hide their faces. 
MICHAEL Hey, shut up. 
CHARLIE Get him in. 
JOHNNY BOY What...are you kidding. 
BENTON Sammy, get in here this minute. 
SAMMY I won't...I won't! They're all beautiful. (SHOUTING) I'll suck them all...I'll suck them all! 
CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY groan. They are still hiding their faces. 
CHARLIE Disgraceful. 
MICHAEL Ok...that's it. 
He pulls the car over to the nearest corner. 
MICHAEL Out!!!! 
CHARLIE C'mon Johnny. 
MICHAEL You getting out too? 
CHARLIE Yeah, thanks, it's ok. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT BLACK & WHITE 
CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY get out of the car first so that by the time BENTON and SAMMY are out they are already on their way down the street. MICHAEL drives away. 
SAMMY (SHOUTING) Going our way? 
CHARLIE (to JOHNNY BOY) Don't answer. 
BENTON guides SAMMY the opposite way. 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAWN 
CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY are walking down the street on their way home. 
JOHNNY BOY I don't think I should go home looking like this. You think I could stay at your place tonight? Your mother's not there is she? 
CHARLIE No, she isn't. 
CUT TO: 
FLASHBACK 
INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
CHARLIE lives in a typical lower east side tenement apartment. Each room is painted a different pastel color. It is furnished in miscellaneous styles and from the pictures on the wall and various knick-knacks around the rooms it is evident that this is a family apartment rather than a bachelors pad. 
JOHNNY BOY is now by the window looking out at the fire escape mischieviously. 
JOHNNY BOY Yeah...you're right. Maybe she'll have a seizure and we can watch. 
He laughs. CHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY on the back of the head. 
CHARLIE That's not funny. You gonna be a jerk-off all your life. Grow up. You want something to eat from your aunt's house you go knock on her door, understand? 
JOHNNY BOY I'm not hungry anymore. I'm going to bed. 
JOHNNY BOY gets into bed. CHARLIE goes into the kitchen to get a glass of milk. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAYBREAK 
CHARLIE takes a glass of milk from the icebox. He listens to the sounds of the neighborhood waking up and getting ready to go to work. He leaves the kitchen. 
INT. BEDROOM - CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAYBREAK 
CHARLIE returns to the bedroom. JOHNNY BOY appears to be asleep. CHARLIE goes to the window and peers through the blinds. He sees in the window across the fire escape. 
A SERIES OF DISSOLVES. TERESA is going through the various stages of getting dressed. 
TERESA RONCHALI is 30 years, well built, attractive and intelligent. She is well read and quiet. The salary she makes as a secretary in a book publishing firm practically supports her family. She has epilepsy which has prevented her (in her own mind) from entering into any serious relationships with men. She has however, been having an affair with CHARLIE for the past year. It is a well kept secret from both families because the families regard each other as blood relations. 
CHARLIE is startled by JOHNNY BOY who is now awake and has begun to dial the telephone. 
JOHNNY BOY (pretending to be angry) Hello...fifth precinct? Yeah...I want to report a disturbance. Yeah this man and woman next door are disturbing the peace. They're keeping me awake all night now. What the hell is this. What? Well... yelling, fighting, throwing things. Uh-huh. If they don't kill each other soon I'm goin' over there and do the job myself. Yes - the address is 270 Mott street. I think it's apartment 2-r. Yeah, right... thanks. Look, I demand immediate action. Never mind my name I don't like getting involved in things like this. 
He hangs up roughly and returns to his position in bed. CHARLIE shakes his head with an exasperated smile as if this was a common occurance. CHARLIE turns back to look at TERESA but she is no longer in her room. 
INT. TERESA'S BEDROOM 
CHARLIE is dreaming this sequence. He and TERESA are both nude. She is lying face down on the bed. He approached and ejaculates prematurely - However, he doesn't ejaculate sperm - instead blood. They are shocked. The blood is on the bed, her legs, back, and his hands. Charlie cries out in pain. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - MID-DAY 
CHARLIE and TERESA are in the hotel room making love. The sounds of traffic can be heard from the street below. 
CUT TO: 
They are getting dressed. 
TERESA I'd like to eat something before I go back to work. 
CHARLIE Ok, we'll go for lunch. 
TERESA Do you have enough? 
CHARLIE checks his wallet. 
CHARLIE Well...with the hotel that's ten... fifteen... 
TERESA Here. 
She hands him a few bills. He hesitates. 
TERESA Please take it. 
CHARLIE Well... 
TERESA I don't mind. 
She puts the money into his hand. 
CHARLIE Sure...it's not that...I mean... 
TERESA (touching his face) It's all right. 
CHARLIE (CONTINUED) Like, looking at my uncle back there. One way is the obvious; ...man outside the law. On the other hand, instead of a breakdown of order there is a creation of order and instead of the breakdown of law, there is the creation of law...In this society which needs new law because 'What's a crowbar compared to a share of stock. What's the robbing of a bank compared to the founding of one and what's the murder of a man to the gainful employment of that man.' 'Do not think that I have come to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I have not come to destroy but to fulfill.' ...Amen. 
The image culminate in aerial shots of downtown New York City. (STOCK FOOTAGE) 
CHARLIE now sees MARIE totally naked as she serves the customers. 
INT. DINING ROOM - DAY 
GIOVANNI and CHARLIE are standing and talking. 
CHARLIE Uncle, how are you feeling? 
GIOVANNI Fine. Did you have a good time last night? 
CHARLIE (QUIETLY) About that shooting last night...I was there and... 
GIOVANNI No you weren't. 
CHARLIE is struck silent for a moment. He listens. 
CHARLIE (EMBARRASSED) You're right uncle. I must have gotten it confused with something else. 
GIOVANNI Yes, you did. 
CUT TO: 
CHARLIE and GIOVANNI are now sitting at a table. 
CHARLIE About Oscar...I think he put on this act...about the restaurant being in bad shape and all that. He can't make the payments...I don't know what to make of it. He says Groppi's run off with a girl. I could help if you want. 
GIOVANNI No...his business is bad. But I'll decide what to do and you...and you just keep out of anything that might...might...er draw attention to you. 
CHARLIE Yes...I understand...I'll be careful. 
EXT. BEACH - HAMPTONS - DAY 
CHARLIE and TERESA are sitting on the beach which is fairly deserted. There are rented cottages behind them. TERESA has a book and some papers from which she is supposed to write a term paper for CHARLIE'S English class. 
TERESA C'mon Charlie...one more day. I'll call in sick for work. 
CHARLIE No...we can come back in a couple of weeks. Besides, if we're both gone for three days it wouldn't look right. 
TERESA Ok. 
CHARLIE picks up a copy of Henry James' Portrait of a Lady and tries to read it. He tosses it aside. 
CHARLIE Bore. 
TERESA A paper on that one too? 
CHARLIE Yeah...but don't worry about that now. The Hemmingway one is first. 
TERESA It was nothing. I'm almost finished. 
CHARLIE Take your time. I don't care. 
TERESA I know you don't. You've been very preoccupied lately. 
CHARLIE That's the word...preoccupied. 
CHARLIE turns towards TERESA and tries to kiss her. She playfully turns away. But CHARLIE quickly gets bored with that and doesn't pursue her. She is confused by his actions. 
CHARLIE Let's go back inside. 
CUT TO: 
CHARLIE and TERESA already farther up the beach, walking. They notice a very beautiful house with limousines parked in front of it. 
CHARLIE Of all people. Now say the truth. Do I look like Che Guevara. C'mon. 
They laugh. He crosses to TERESA and they kiss. 
TERESA I'm sleepy. 
CHARLIE You've been running round too much. Bet you've been forgetting your medicine. 
TERESA The green capsules in the top drawer. 
CHARLIE gets her the pills and heads out of the cottage for a walk. 
EXT. ROADWAY - HAMPTONS - DAY 
CHARLIE is walking along the roadway and looking at the different cottages. He is carrying a notebook to which he periodically refers. He stops in front of a luxurious cottage and checks the address on the signpost with the one in his notebook beside which is listed the name GROPPI. He remains standing at a safe distance from the cottage staring at it. It looks deserted. 
FANTASY 
EXT. ROADWAY IN FRONT OF COTTAGE - DAY 
CHARLIE walks directly to the front door of the cottage and rings the bell confidently. The door is opened immediately which startles him. From inside the house we see GROPPI'S back as he holds the door open. He is in a satin robe. We can see CHARLIE'S startled face through the partially opened door. 
GROPPI What do you want kid? 
At that moment a nude girl, her back to the CAMERA appears in the FOREGROUND. This startles CHARLIE even more. 
GROPPI What do you want?.......well? 
CHARLIE I...I'm selling encyclopedias...er a magazines...newspapers...I'm conducting a survey...I... 
GROPPI We don't want no fuckin' books! 
GROPPI slams the door in CHARLIE'S face. 
REALITY 
EXT. ROADWAY IN FRONT OF COTTAGE - DAY 
CHARLIE is still standing in front of the cottage. Suddenly a little boy of about nine appears. 
BOY There's nobody here mister. 
CHARLIE turns in surprise. 
CHARLIE Isn't this Jack Groppi's place? 
BOY Yeah. But he ain't here now. 
CHARLIE Know where he is? 
BOY Follow me. 
The BOY leads him towards a heavily overgrown treed area. 
CHARLIE How much farther? 
CHARLIE repeats this question periodically as he follows the BOY. Finally CHARLIE finds himself alone in the middle of a dense forest with the BOY nowhere in sight. He calls out but there is no answer. He realizes he's been had. 
CHARLIE (CONFESSION) Now, don't get excited. 
CHARLIE is trying to find his way out of the forest. 
CHARLIE (CONTINUED) 'The stone which the builders' reject will become the cornerstone'...I think. 
INT. ITALIAN CAFE - DAY 
A loud brass band is playing "Oh Johnny, Oh Johnny, How You Can Love" inside the cafe. They are part of a religious festival and GIOVANNI has invited them in for drinks. In return they are playing for him. GIOVANNI has been drinking. The song ends. 
EXT. STREET CORNER - NEAR CAFE - DAY 
MICHAEL I gave him all the breaks I can give. 
CHARLIE Oh Michael, look... 
MICHAEL Nevamind 'look'...This punk bastard...I call him at work...I say 'Johnny Boy there?'...He doesn't even show up for work anymore... 
CHARLIE Look...I've talked to him and I've talked to him...what more can I do...? Tonight at the party all three of us get together and we knock some sense into his head...ok? 
MICHAEL All right...but understand, I don't like being taken advantage of. I mean you're in there talking with your uncle and all...This is embarassing. 
CHARLIE We'll settle it tonight. 
Two YOUNG BOYS about 15 years old walk up to CHARLIE. 
BOY #1 Hey, you sell firecrackers? 
CHARLIE Firecrackers! No...no. 
BOY #1 You know where we can get some? 
CHARLIE Sure, see that guy over there... 
He points to MICHAEL. 
CHARLIE (CONTINUING) ...him. He's got the best. 
The BOYS go over to MICHAEL. 
BOY #1 Hey - fella...you sell firecrackers? 
MICHAEL Sssh! Quiet. (He looks around) Y'know that's illegal. 
BOY #2 Well the guy over there said... 
MICHAEL (INTERRUPTING) Yeah, yeah, never mind. You gotta be careful. 
BOY #1 We went down to Chinatown but they don't have any. 
MICHAEL Yeah, well, keep away from those Chinx. They don't have shit. 
BOY #2 Well, we got $40, and we wanna buy... 
MICHAEL (INTERRUPTING) All right! Quiet! For $40 I could give you... 
BOY #1 Well, I don't know if we want to buy all $40 worth... 
MICHAEL Hey! You want good stuff, or you want shit? 
BOY #2 Well, we want good stuff. 
MICHAEL Well, my stuff comes from Maryland... you know what that means? 
BOY #1 No. 
MICHAEL That means it's good. 
BOY #1 You got sparklers? 
MICHAEL Yeah. 
BOY #2 And cherry bombs...ash cans...and rockets? 
MICHAEL Ok. For another $5.00 a special on the packs. 
BOY #1 No, all we got is $40.

INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
CHARLIE is at home shaving. 
CHARLIE (CONFESSION) You know damn well what's going to happen tonight. I'll probably get drunk at that party...it isn't every day you send one of your best friends off to war for God and country... gotta have a party. I mean, he's a nice kid. 
CUT TO: 
CHARLIE is gluing on a fake beard. 
CHARLIE (VOICE OVER) I don't know what You think of him but that's between You and him anyway...I can't help feeling sorry for him though. Has a talent but doesn't use it...His brain. An 'Unprofitable servant who shall be cast forth into the darkness outside, where there will be... 
CUT TO: 
Television image of old women mourning their dead in India. The images are slow motion. The news continues with more trivial news images...(Washington investigations, demonstrations, etc.) 
CHARLIE (continued voice over) ...the weeping and the gnashing of teeth'...or something like that. My talent's my brain too but I use my talent...I'm not saying that I'm a genius...You'll probably be the first one to agree on that, but I can tell the difference between the intelligent and the stupid. Take the army for example... 
CUT TO: 
CHARLIE grabbing a white robe off his bed. We don't see his face. 
CHARLIE (continued voice over) That's there and I'm here and that's the way it's going to stay! 
INT. WEST SIDE TENEMENT APARTMENT BATHROOM - NIGHT 
TONY enters the bathroom, turns on the light and locks the door. Party noises can be heard in the background TONY is wearing an overcoat and is dressed as a World War I "dough boy". Atop his head is a mask, the features of which can't be seen. He opens the coat to reveal twenty packets of red Jello. He turns on the hot water in the bathtub and slowly begins to empty each packet of Jello into the tub of steaming water. 
CUT TO: 
LIVING ROOM & KITCHENETTE - PARTY - NIGHT 
Most of the characters that were at the club the other night are present at the party. Many of them are dressed in semi- masquerade outfits. Some are wearing soldiers' uniforms. One wears a sheet made up to be a Roman Toga. The girls are in costumes also. All of the costumes are makeshift. MICHAEL is made up as Dracula, sporting a large cape, semi tuxedo-type suit, and a drop of blood on the corner of his mouth. His hair is slicked back to give him a "Bela Lugosi" look. He is showing a picture of a girl to one of the boys, proudly proclaiming that she is his latest conquest. TONY comes out of the bathroom and passes by. He takes the photo from MICHAEL. Group attention focuses on TONY now. He stares at the picture, holds it away from him, then closer to his face, then sideways and finally upside-down. 
TERESA Oh sure! I know her Michael...In fact, I saw her a few days ago under a bridge in Jersey, making out with a nigger. 
MICHAEL grimaces in shock. He spits. 
MICHAEL You sure?...a nigger...Uh!...and I kissed her. 
He wipes his lips with his cape. 
The guest of honor, the young soldier is very drunk. He is attempting to open his going away presents, one of which turns out to be a carefully folded American flag. He attempts to open it with one great flourish. He fails however, knocking over the glasses on the table. The group applauds. 
MICHAEL I'll tell you who you can pray for... Next payday, I'll be at Tony's Place...Johnny better show or I find him and break his legs...and I mean it. 
CHARLIE (in the same manner) 'But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; on the contrary, if someone takes thy tunic, let him take thy cloak as well...to him who asks of thee, give; and from him who would borrow of thee do not turn away! 
MICHAEL (EXASPERATED) He could at least show some respect and show his face, even if he doesn't have the money... 
CHARLIE (more serious now) 'Amen I say to thee, thou wilt not come out from it until thou hast paid the last penny.' 
MICHAEL You said it. 
A loud scream is heard from the bathroom. 
CUT TO: 
APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Someone shoved a nude girl into the bathtub which is now filled with congealed red jello. The boys are laughing and shoving each other about roughly. CHARLIE comes out of the next room and walks along in a Christ like manner through the madness, his arms outstretched. One boy kneels and kisses the hem of his robe and CHARLIE blesses him. There is a great deal of pushing and shoving going on inside the bathroom and near the doorway. CHARLIE promises to save the sinner as he pushes his way through. He helps the girl remove the jello from her body and helps her out of the bathtub. It is obvious that she is quite stoned. She caresses him and they find themselves kissing. The others storm into the bathroom and grab CHARLIE. 
EVERYONE Blasphemy!...The anti-Christ! Crucify him!! 
They drag CHARLIE into the next room where, amidst all the shouting and laughing, the other members of the party are placing firecrackers on model airplanes, simulating their own "dog fight". They are flying the planes out the open window. 
CHARLIE takes everything in stride trying to shout a few lines over their laughter. 
CHARLIE 'Father...forgive them...for they know not...what they do...' 
The doorbell rings and TONY answers it. It is TERESA and she looks very worried. 
TERESA Charlie...? Charlie here...? 
CUT TO: 
BLACK & WHITE 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
CHARLIE and TERESA dash from a tenement doorway. CHARLIE is still in beard and wig but his robes are open so they give the effect of being a bulky overcoat. 
TERESA (FRANTICALLY) The building on the corner. That one! He's been on the roof a half hour now! 
CHARLIE Now don't get excited. Don't get excited!! 
It is very late and the streets are deserted. At the corner of the building in question, a few of JOHNNY BOY'S friends cling to the wall for safety. When they see CHARLIE and TERESA they call out. 
FRIENDS Charlie, stay there...He's crazy... He's got a 22. 
TERESA gets up against a wall. CHARLIE sends her down the block and she leaves reluctantly. 
CHARLIE Johnny it's me, Charlie. 
JOHNNY BOY can now be seen silhouetted against the moonlight on the tenement roof. He has a gun in his hand. 
JOHNNY BOY Don't come any closer!!! 
CHARLIE Cut it out stupid. It's me. 
JOHNNY BOY fires a shot into the air. CHARLIE clings to the wall with the others. A moment later he makes a quick run for the doorway of the building across the street. He enters the building that leads to the roof. 
BLACK & WHITE 
EXT. TENEMENT ROOF - NIGHT 
CHARLIE has reached the roof. 
JOHNNY BOY Charlie...pssst. Over here. 
He laughs with glee. 
They leave. 
INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
CHARLIE is sitting in the corner. The restaurant is in the same condition that it was the last time he was there. While CHARLIE waits for his uncle in his semi-private corner, a handful of old Mafiosi, invited by GIOVANNI, sit at another table. GIOVANNI enters with MARIO. The old Mafiosi are greeted first. They rise and kiss GIOVANNI on the cheek. CHARLIE is very impressed at their respectful showing. The waitresses and everyone else in the club treat them all like royalty. 
CUT TO: 
OSCAR approaches the table where CHARLIE, GIOVANNI, and MARIO are seated and greets them warmly. 
OSCAR Put the menus away. I, personally do the cooking tonight. 
GIOVANNI Fine...that's why I'm here. 
MARIO Calamari? 
OSCAR Capozelle, Calamari...anything you want... 
GIOVANNI (POURING WINE) Drink. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - LATER IN THE MEAL 
OSCAR sits. 
OSCAR Giovanni...er...can I talk? 
Refering to CHARLIE. 
GIOVANNI nods his head yes. 
OSCAR About the place, Giovanni... 
GIOVANNI ...I know all about it. We'll discuss it later. 
OSCAR (CONTINUING) Our arrangements about the place haven't changed, have they? I mean... 
GIOVANNI (GOOD-NATUREDLY) No, no, not at all...look, we leave it the way it is for now, we talk later, understand? 
OSCAR (SOMEWHAT RELIEVED) Sure, Giovanni...I understand. I'll bring the clams now. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT - DURING DINNER 
CHARLIE is visible awed by GIOVANNI and MARIO'S confidence and power. He is behaving as if he were at a job interview...very formally. CHARLIE had often had dinner with his uncle but this time the conversation is more pointed. Their conversation is mostly in ITALIAN WITH ENGLISH TITLES. They are discusssing GROPPI'S suicide. 
CHARLIE I really couldn't believe it when you told me, you know that? 
GIOVANNI Well, he was always a little crazy... he puts a gun in his mouth... (HE SMILES) ...like your friend...comme si chiama...Henning? Heming? 
CHARLIE Hemmingway. Killed himself. I was more upset about that than about Groppi, that's for sure. 
GIOVANNI (laughing to MARIO) You know, this boy over here, once, long time ago, tried to enrich my mind...so he gives me a book by this Hemin fella...to read, so I read it. 
CHARLIE Wasn't a book...was a short story. 
MARIO What was it? 
CHARLIE (EMBARRASSED) Nothing. 
MARIO No, c'mon...Y'know, I read. 
CHARLIE (MUTTERING) "Francis Macomber." 
MARIO Wha? 
CHARLIE What do they expect you to say? 
GIOVANNI Who knows? It's not hard to figure out what she'll wind up like. When the respect for parents breaks down, that's bad...you know I'm "cumpari" with them...so I take an interest. You live next door, keep an eye open...but don't get involved. 
CHARLIE All right. 
MARIO Why don't you take a look around the place if you want? 
CHARLIE Oh, that's ok...I've been in and out of this place fifty times. 
GIOVANNI Well, maybe you missed something? 
CHARLIE (CATCHING ON) Oh yeah, that's a possibility. 
CHARLIE heads for the kitchen. 
CHARLIE (CONFESSION) ...looks good...things look good, if I may say so myself. Don't you agree? Unless there's something You know that I don't know? 
CUT TO: 
INT. OSCAR'S RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT 
CHARLIE is examining the kitchen closely. A black cook is working hard, taking a piece of meat off the grill. He carefully prepares a dish. 
COOK Hi Charlie. 
CHARLIE smiles and moves in closer to the grill. The cook is sweating and mopping his brow. 
COOK (CONTINUING) Man, it's hot as Hell in here, every day like going through Hell in here. 
CHARLIE moves in closer and the COOK continues preparing the food. 
CHARLIE (SMILING) Hot as hell...You're not the only one going through Hell kid. 
COOK Maybe so...but at this pay it ain't worth it...that much I can tell you. 
CHARLIE hasn't been listening to the COOK. He has become fascinated with the flames on the grill. They remind him of an old device from his Catholic School days. CHARLIE brings his hand forward and closer to the fire, testing the pain of the "Fires of Hell." 
CHARLIE (CONFESSION) 'If thy hand is an occasion of sin to thee, cut it off. It is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire. 'Where their worm dies not and the fire is not quenched.' 
CHARLIE'S hand touches the flame. He winces. Music in. 
INT. TONY'S CAR (NEW CADILLAC CONVERTIBLE-TOP UP) - DAY 
CHARLIE, JOHNNY, TONY and JIMMY are driving along in TONY'S car. As they talk, a derelict takes advantage of a red light to wipe their windshield. 
TONY rolls up the window and rolls the car forward a bit to force the derelict out of the way. 
TONY Is it near Sullivan Street? 
JIMMY No - by Bedford. 
TONY Oh - you gotta show me. I always get lost in the village. 
CHARLIE Next time, bet with your own kind. 
JIMMY The number was 235 - I bet it combination. 
CHARLIE It'll be OK - I know those guys. They won't stiff you. 
JIMMY I bet 235. Because I dreamt of my grandfather - and when he died, the number of the funeral parlour was 235 - so when I dreamt... 
JOHNNY BOY Yeah, yeah - enough. 
They arrive at the bar. 
JOEY Hello Charlie, you canonized yet? 
JOEY We were gonna pay you Jimmy, we just don't like being moved in on. 
CHARLIE C'mon -- I'm movin' in on you? Let's have another drink and forget about it. 
They drink again. JOEY gives JIMMY the money, JIMMY goes to count it. 
JOEY Don't count it...it's all there. 
JOHNNY BOY (SARCASTIC) Count it. 
JOEY Hey, c'mon - no bullshit - friends. 
JOEY extends his hand. JIMMY and CHARLIE shake. JOEY extends his hand to JOHNNY. 
JOHNNY BOY Don't fuckin' touch me - scumbag. 
CHARLIE and the others "Oh no." 
CHARLIE Shut up stupid. 
He is interrupted by a flying fist. The fight breaks out anew. They barely make it to the door. JIMMY is out first, with his cash. They run down the street. The west side boys don't chase them but stand by their bar shouting after them. 
JOHNNY is laughing as he runs. CHARLIE yells at him. 
CHARLIE You got some mouth! 
JIMMY Johnny, you're a real jerk-off. 
JOHNNY BOY (LAUGHING) What're ya hollering? You got your money. 
They reach the car. TONY heads in first behind the wheel. 
TONY (about to take off) Fuck youse all. 
The others jump in. 
CHARLIE You got no honor Tony. Charge! 
The car starts off. 
Garbage and garbage pails are tosses after them as the boys take off. 
INT. TONY'S PLACE 
CUT TO: 
A LONG-HAIRED ROCK GROUP 
The lead guitarist holds his guitar out like a machine gun and strums frantically on it swinging it back and forth at the audience and then at the rest of the group. As he does so, the rest of the group falls "dead" over their instruments. The number is over and they all get up. The place is empty except for CHARLIE, TONY, and a few others, all of whom have been listening to the band. They applaude. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TONY'S PLACE 
CHARLIE is talking to the leader of the group. 
CHARLIE No, really, I liked it...thought it was great. 
BOY Thanks. 
CHARLIE What are your plans? 
BOY Well, we're here for about two weeks, then whatever else comes along... we're still working on our album and... 
CHARLIE Great...great...listen, I'm very interested in you guys because I'll be opening a new club myself soon... uptown...and maybe we can work something out... 
BOY Sounds good. 
CHARLIE Don't be smart. 
JOHNNY BOY I'm not smart...I'm stupid, remember. I'm so stupid that you have to look out for me, remember? 
TERESA is crying. 
JOHNNY BOY Don't be upset Teresa. You have to understand Charlie, here...he gives of himself to help others... 
TERESA I'm going to go home. 
JOHNNY BOY No, you stay. 
CHARLIE Johnny, I swear to God, if you open your mouth about any of this... 
JOHNNY BOY (ANGRY) Me? I wouldn't say a word to my aunt and uncle...or even your uncle, Charlie... 
TERESA makes it to the door and opens it quickly. JOHNNY BOY grabs her to keep her from leaving. CHARLIE rushes towards them and pulls JOHNNY BOY away. By now, they are halfway down the hall. 
JOHNNY BOY (SHOUTING) Charlie...I always wondered about her...what happens when she comes? Does she get one of those fits? Eh? That would be something to see... 
JOHNNY BOY is interrupted by CHARLIE'S fist as it lands a solid punch on the right side of his hand. TERESA screams and rushes to separate them. 
JOHNNY BOY You rat bastard!! Don't hit me again!! 
CHARLIE stops. 
JOHNNY BOY I think I will fuckin go see your uncle right now...he'd be interested. 
CHARLIE rushes JOHNNY BOY towards the stairs. They bump into TERESA, slamming her against the wall. 
CHARLIE Go ahead! Go on! And we'll see what happens to you without me. 
TERESA is terrified that JOHNNY BOY will really go to CHARLIE'S uncle. 
TERESA No...no...don't. 
TERESA falls, hitting the stairs with a thud. She lies there moaning and tossing her head. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY go to help her. 
CHARLIE What do I do? You know anything about this? 
JOHNNY BOY steps over TERESA to go down the stairs. He turns. 
JOHNNY BOY I don't know...she's your girl...I gotta go. 
CHARLIE is furious. JOHNNY BOY points to TERESA who is getting worse. 
JOHNNY BOY Hate to miss the floor show, though. 
CHARLIE lunges out at JOHNNY BOY shoving him halfway down the stairs. He has gotten hold of his coat so that JOHNNY BOY can't leave. Neighbors from downstairs open their doors and come up the stairs. CHARLIE, in complete panic, tries to put something into TERESA'S mouth while holding JOHNNY BOY at the same time. He shoves his hand into her mouth trying to pry it open but she bites into it. CHARLIE screams as the blood streams out. He lets go of JOHNNY BOY. 
The neighbors take over. One woman appears to know how to administer aid to TERESA. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHARLIE'S BUILDING - STAIRS 
JOHNNY BOY is halfway down the stairs by now. The neighbor takes care of TERESA. While CHARLIE dashes down the stairs, CHARLIE grabs JOHNNY in the ground floor hallway. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT - BLACK AND WHITE 
In the deserted factory section of Manhattan, JOHNNY BOY and CHARLIE stand next to a corregated metal garage door. CHARLIE smashes JOHNNY BOY against the door sending resounding echoes into the street. 
CHARLIE You crazy bastard! What are you trying to do, ruin me? 
JOHNNY BOY is not fighting back anymore. He is on the verge of tears. CHARLIE smashes him against the door again--again the crashing sound reverberates in the empty street. 
CHARLIE You... 
CHARLIE leans back into the seat and peeks out the window. 
CHARLIE No...don't stop...just pass real slow, OK? 
CHARLIE looks out the window and sees DIANE, the negro stripper. She is standing on the corner waiting for him. CHARLIE nods his head for the driver to stop. 
CHARLIE Stop here. (HE HESITATES) No...what am I...crazy??? Take me back to where you picked me up. 
CAB DRIVER (SIGHING) Ok. 
The car drives away, passing DIANE who is on the corner. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TONY'S PLACE 
CHARLIE is back inside the club. 
JOHNNY BOY Back so soon. 
CHARLIE Mind your own business. 
TONY sets up drinks for them and pours them into shot glasses. 
CHARLIE strikes a match and lights each glass... little blue flames dance along the rims of the glasses. 
TERESA Hey, cut it out. Will ya? 
He blows out the flames. CHARLIE moves to the other and of the room with his drink. 
CHARLIE (CONFESSION) You can see things aren't going too well for me at the moment. My willpower and powers of persuasion are not what they usually are today. My ability to control events and situations are wanting. I know. I know...what can I say...I offer this as part of my penance. 
A young couple, two of the few people left in the place, are having a hushed quarrel at the end of the bar. The boy leaves for the men's room. 
CHARLIE (TO TONY) Who's the girl? 
TONY Jewish... 
CHARLIE How do you know? 
TONY Look at her. 
CHARLIE She don't look Jewish. 
TONY Sure she is. She's always in here with some different guy. You know the way they are. 
CHARLIE approaches the girl. 
CHARLIE I love you. 
The girl looks at him, first embarrassed, then annoyed. 
CHARLIE (SMILING) Ever since that first day I saw you at the convent with the nuns, playing volleyball, I couldn't help myself. 
GIRL You Italian? 
CHARLIE Yeah why? 
GIRL You don't look it. 
The girl laughs. Her boyfriend comes out of the men's room. He has her coat in his hand. 
GIRL (to the Boy) Fuck off. 
BOY (STUNNED) What do you mean? (he looks at CHARLIE) ...let's go. 
GIRL You go...I'm staying. 
MICHAEL You're not going to use that gun, Johnny. 
JOHNNY BOY doesn't answer but holds the gun straight at MICHAEL'S face. MICHAEL turns to go, defying JOHNNY BOY. His friends follow. When he reaches the doorway, he turns. 
MICHAEL You don't have the guts to use that...be seeing you Charlie, Tony, and of course you John...be seeing you. 
They leave. 
JOHNNY BOY is still frozen with the gun in his hand, pointing it at mid-air. CHARLIE slams JOHNNY BOY across the face with his fist. TONY takes the gun from his hand. 
CHARLIE You stupid bastard! Never pull a gun unless you intend to use it. 
He hits JOHNNY BOY again. 
TONY (HOLDING GUN) ...No bullets in it. 
CHARLIE hits JOHNNY BOY again. 
TONY Get out of here before this really goes up. 
CHARLIE Hide the gun. Throw it away. Anything. Listen, I gotta borrow your car...I think we should take a ride...away from here for the night...you know what I mean? 
TONY (RELUCTANTLY) Ok...but go to a movie first or something...not good to be driving around right away. You know you can't do much for him now...it's out of your hands. 
CUT TO: 
SCENE FROM "TOMB OF LIGEIA" 
A young girl is in her room with her maid. The maid is helping her dress. Eerie music creates a frightening atmosphere. CHARLIE and JOHNNY BOY watch nervously affected by the film's mood. The theatre is a 42nd street one with lots of sleeping drunks. 
Suddenly, the maid's face begins to contort as if she's seeing something horrible. The audience is on edge. The young girl sees the maid and shouts "What is it?" - but the maid only sneezes. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NIGHT - TONY'S CONVERTIBLE - BLACK AND WHITE 
CHARLIE is driving. JOHNNY BOY is beside him in the front seat. The top od the car is down and CHARLIE is driving with no particular destination in mind. 
JOHNNY BOY I think we should see your uncle. 
CHARLIE No. 
JOHNNY BOY This can't be settled any other way now...I'll take full blame. 
CHARLIE Forget it. 
JOHNNY BOY What are you going to do? Hide me? 
CHARLIE Good idea. 
JOHNNY BOY turns away and tunes in the radio to a loud rock song. 
CHARLIE (CONFESSION) I guess you could safely say that this evening has been so far very unimpressive as far as my efforts are concerned...more unproductive. Now, I'd like to know what you do, for an encore, Lord? I know penance is penance but this is something else. 
JOHNNY BOY opens his eyes. 
JOHNNY BOY What are you talking to yourself??? 
He turns up the radio. 
CHARLIE (SARCASTIC) Go ahead! Play the radio...play music...you're going to a party... louder! Go ahead. Louder. A party. Lots of fun. 
A black sedan has been driving along parallel to CHARLIE'S car, unnoticed by CHARLIE. Otherwise the street is deserted. The car begins to drive CHARLIE off the road. 
CHARLIE Hey, what is this guy, crazy? 
CUT TO: 
The last song of the festival is ending now. As the singers come to a stirring climax they wave and shout in Italian. 
SINGERS Good night...Good night...thank you...good night! 
The band plays a few bars of "Home Sweet Home." The singers throw kisses to the dispursing crowd. People who have been watching the festival pull down the blinds of shades and go in. 
CUT TO: 
MICHAEL'S CAR - PARKED 
MICHAEL'S car is parked in a deserted area on the docks. He has his head in his hands. The BOY with him says nothing. 
CUT TO: 
STREET CORNER 
CHARLIE is still in shock, sitting on the curb. 
The police are still walking around in a businesslike manner. 
CHARLIE stares down at his feet. The wrecked car is being pulled away. 
CHARLIE is being put into an ambulance. He is muttering to himself and seems shocked and bewildered. 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
Early morning. A door in the far corner of the room opens. CHARLIE is motioned through by a cop, who shuts the door immediately behind him. There is an unnaturally loud clanging sound that echoes in the room. CHARLIE looks around, still a little dazed, and spots MARIO standing over by the door. MARIO has made no move to greet him. He just stands there watching. CHARLIE walks over to him, sensing something a little ominous. 
CHARLIE My uncle didn't come? 
MARIO says nothing, just nods at him to step outside. CHARLIE goes out into the street. MARIO follows. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
There is practically no one on the street. The early morning light makes everything a clammy grey. CHARLIE waits at the bottom of the steps. 
MARIO (pauses for a moment) Giovanni says now he done enough. He got you outta jail. Now... (reaching in pocket) he wants you outta the way. 
MARIO hands CHARLIE an envelope containing an airline ticket. 
MARIO He says use it. Don't sell it. He says he'll see you. Someday. Maybe. 
CHARLIE stares at the ticket in his hand. MARIO is obviously uncomfortable. 
MARIO (ABRUPTLY) Things worked out rotten kid. Sorry. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - DAY 
TONY'S car. He is driving CHARLIE to the airport. A suitcase can be seen in the back seat. 
TONY Where to? 
CHARLIE (PREOCCUPIED) Kennedy. 
TONY (trying to be jolly) I know, I know, stupid. I mean where you goin'? 
CHARLIE It's an open ticket. I can go anywhere up to $350. 
TONY So? 
CHARLIE (EDGY) So I'll send you a postcard from wherever. If I get there.

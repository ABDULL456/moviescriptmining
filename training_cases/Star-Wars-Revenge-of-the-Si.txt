STAR WARS EPISODE 3: REVENGE OF THE SITH SCRIPT 
George Lucas 
1 EXT. SPACE 
A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away. 
A vast sea of stars serves as the backdrop for the Main Title, followed by a rollup, which crawls into infinity. 
War! The Republic is crumbling under attacks by the ruthless Sith Lord, Count Dooku. There are heroes on both sides. Evil is everywhere. 
In a stunning move, the fiendish droid leader, General Grievous, has swept into the Republic capital and kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine, leader of the Galactic Senate. 
As the Separatist Droid Army attempts to flee the besieged capital with their valuable hostage, two Jedi Knights lead a desperate mission to rescue the captive Chancellor. . . . 
PAN DOWN to reveal a REPUBLIC ATTACK CRUISER. Continue to PAN with the Cruiser as TWO JEDI STARFIGHTERS enter and head toward an enemy Battle Cruiser. TRUCK with the Jedi Fighters as they maneuver in unison, dodging flack and enemy laser fire. R2-D2 is on Anakin's ship. R4-P17 is on Obi-Wan's ship. A giant space battle is revealed as the tiny Jedi ships continue their assault in a synchronous ballet. 
2 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE 
OBI-WAN bounces through the flack with a frown. His ship rocks violently. 
3 INT. ANAKINS STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE 
ANAKIN smiles as he blasts a TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTER. 
ANAKIN: There isn't a droid made that can out fly you, Master, and no other way to get to the Chancellor . . . 
OBI-WAN: Look out, four droids inbound . . . 
4 EXT. CORUSCANT-SPACE BATTLE 
The TWO JEDI FIGHTERS swerve in unison as FOUR TRADE FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS attack. After several clever moves by the Jedi, two of the FEDERATION DROID DROP FIGHTERS collide with each other in a ball of flame. 
5 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE 
OBI-WAN struggles to maintain control of his ship. 
OBI-WAN: We've got to split them up. 
ANAKIN: Break left, fly through the guns on that tower. 
OBI-WAN flies to the left of a huge tower on a REPUBLIC CRUISER. The TWO DROID DROP FIGHTERS follow. 
OBI-WAN: Easy for you to say . . . why am I always the bait? 
ANAKIN: Don't worry. I'm coming around behind you. 
OBI-WAN deftly maneuvers around a large Starship's superstructure, but the TWO DROID FIGHTERS stay on his tail, BLASTING him with intense laser fire. 
OBI-WAN: Anakin, they're all over me! 
ANAKIN: Dead ahead! Closing . . . lock onto him, Artoo . . . 
ARTOO BEEPS his reply as ANAKIN swoops in for the kill. ANAKIN BLASTS one of the DROID DROP FIGHTERS. It EXPLODES. 
ANAKIN: (continuing, laughs) We got him, Artoo! 
ANAKIN BLASTS away at the second DROID DROP FIGHTER as ARTOO BEEPS an angry warning. 
ANAKIN: I copy, Artoo. 
OBI-WAN: I'm going down on the deck. 
ANAKIN: Good idea ... I need some room to maneuver. 
OBI-WAN dives toward the surface of one of the larger TRADE FEDERATION BATTLESHIPS and is forced to fly through a maelstrom of laser flack. He skims the surface, followed by the DROID DROP FIGHTER, which is followed by ANAKIN. 
ANAKIN: (continuing) Cut right. Do you hear me?! Cut right. Don't let him get a handle on you. Come on, Artoo, lock on! Lock on! 
ARTOO BEEPS. The crosshairs merge on the DROID DROP FIGHTER. 
OBI-WAN: Hurry up! I don't like this! 
OBI-WAN flies through a narrow gap between two towers on a Battleship. The DROID DROP FIGHTER hits one of Obi-Wan's wings with a laser blast, and parts of the ship go flying around Obi-Wan's Astro Droid, ARFOUR. 
OBI-WAN: (continuing) Ouch! 
R-4 BEEPS a blue streak. 
OBI-WAN: (continuing) Don't even try to fix it, Arfour. I've shut it down. 
ANAKIN: We're locked on ... we've got him . . . 
ANAKIN drops in behind the DROID DROP FIGHTER and blows him apart. ARTOO SQUEALS with delight. 
ANAKIN: (continuing) Yeah! We got him . . . good going, Artoo. 
OBI-WAN: Next time you're the bait . . . Now let's find the Command Ship and get on with it ... 
R-4 BEEPS a blue streak. 
ANAKIN: Lock onto them, Artoo. Master, General Grievous's ship is directly ahead. 
ARTOO BEEPS a reply, and it reads out in Anakin's cockpit. 
ANAKIN: (continuing) The one crawling with vulture droids. 
6 INT. OBI-WAN'S STARFIGHTER COCKPIT-SPACE 
ARTOO SQUEALS in a panic. On the view screen Artoo's squeal reads out, "WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE IT." 
ANAKIN: Wrong thought, Artoo. 
ANAKIN slips through the narrow gap. The trailing VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS CRASH. 
ANAKIN: (continuing) I'm through. 
OBI-WAN continues to fire on the VULTURE DROID FIGHTERS, driving them into the EXPLOSION. A CLONE fighter is hit and explodes, spewing debris. The CLONE PILOT spins off into space. Finally, OBI-WAN peels off and swings around, pulling up alongside ANAKIN. CLONE FIGHT SQUAD SEVEN battles the DROIDS. 
ODD BALL: There are too many of them. 
CLONE PILOT 2: I'm on your wing. Break left. Break left. They're all over me. Get them off my . . . 
ANAKIN: I'm going to go help them out! 
OBI-WAN: No, no! They are doing their job so we can do ours. Head for the Command Ship! 
Another CLONE fighter is hit, bursts into flames, and spins off into space. A VULTURE DROID FIGHTER raises its head to locate its target and fires missiles at them. 
ANAKIN: Missiles! Pull up! 
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN break right and left, and the missiles follow them. ANAKIN does a barrel roll spin, causing the missiles following him to collide and EXPLODE. Two missiles continue to chase OBI-WAN. He banks sharply to the right, then to the left, causing one of the missiles to overshoot. 
OBI-WAN: They overshot us . . . 
The second missile streaks next to Obi-Wans Fighter and EXPLODES. Obi-Wan's ship rocks, and R-4, SCREAMS as the Starfighter rips through the explosion. Debris flies all around them. 
ANAKIN: They're coming around! 
OBI-WAN: All right, Arfour. No, no. Nothing too fancy. 
ANAKIN: Surge all power units. Artoo! Stand by the reverse thrusters. 
ANAKIN spins his starfighter. The missiles spin and collide. 
ANAKIN: We got 'em. Artoo! 
Two missiles continue to track Obi-Wan. 
OBI-WAN: Flying is for droids. 
Suddenly, OBI-WAN shudders, and his ship starts to plummet toward the surface of the Trade Federation Cruiser. The trailing missiles fly into what looks like debris, and detonate. Five silver balls fly out of the debris and attach themselves to the ship. The balls pop open, revealing SMALL BUZZDROIDS that begin to crawl across the surface like spiders. 
OBI-WAN: (continuing) I'm hit! Anakin? 
ANAKIN: I see them . . . Buzz Droids. 
The BUZZ DROIDS crawl across Obi-Wan's ship and start to tear it apart. SPARKS ERUPT where the BUZZ DROIDS break into the wiring. One of the BUZZ DROIDS goes after ARFOUR. 
OBI-WAN: Arfour, be careful. You have one . . . 
ARFOUR's head gets ripped off and flies away. 
OBI-WAN: Oh dear. They're shutting down all the controls. 
ANAKIN: Move to the right so I can get a clear shot at them. 
OBI-WAN: The mission. Get to the Command Ship. Get the Chancellor! I'm running out of tricks here. 
ANAKIN moves into position just off Obi-Wan's left side and angles his ship so his guns are pointing at the DROIDS crawling over Obi-Wans Starfighter. ANAKIN fires and vaporizes the TWO BUZZ DROIDS, along with the left wing of Obi-Wan's ship. 
OBI-WAN: (continuing) In the name of ... 
ANAKIN: Steady . . . steady . . . 
OBI-WAN: Anakin, hold your fire . . . hold your fire. You're not helping here. 
ANAKIN: I agree, bad idea. Swing right . . . ease over . . . steady . . . 
OBI-WAN: Wait . . . wait . . . I can't see a thing! My cockpit's fogging. They're all over me, Anakin. 
ANAKIN: Move to the right. 
OBI-WAN: Hold on, Anakin. You're going to get us both killed! Get out of here. There's nothing more you can do. 
ANAKIN: I'm not leaving without you, Master. 
ANAKIN moves his ship next to OBI-WAN's and tries to physically knock the BUZZ DROIDS off. There are five left. He manages to get one off, but badly dents OBI-WAN's ship in the process. One of the BUZZ DROIDS tears apiece off of the front of Obi-Wan's ship. Flames burst out, and more smoke billows out, obscuring the Jedi's view. 
ANAKIN knocks off three of the BUZZ DROIDS and the fourth crawls out onto Anakin's ship and starts attacking ARTOO. ARTOO fights the BUZZ DROID. 
OBI-WAN: Blast it ... I can't see . . . my controls are gone. 
ANAKIN: Get 'em, Artoo. Watch out! 
OBI-WAN: Artoo, hit the buzz droid's center eye. 
ARTOO extends an arm and aims a stream of electricity at the swerving BUZZ DROID. The BUZZ DROID is hit squarely in the eye and falls off the ship. 
ANAKIN: Yeah, you got him! 
OBI-WAN: Great, Artoo. 
ANAKIN: Stay on my wing . . . the General's Command Ship is dead ahead. Easy . . . pull up ... Head for the hangar. 
OBI-WAN: Have you noticed the shields are still up? 
ANAKIN: Oh?!? Sorry, Master. 
The TWO JEDI pull themselves through the narrow vent shaft until they reach a small hatch in the side of the tube. 
ANAKIN: Here's a way out. 
As the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS reach the opening in the ceiling and the fuel gets to within a few feet of the power generator sparks, the JEDI work the keyboard on the pressure lock, opening the latch. 
14 INT. SMALL PASSAGEWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
The TWO JEDI climb into a small passageway and slam the hatch shut. They make their way through the ever-shrinking shaft until they reach the end. 
15 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
A hatch opens in one of the main hallways of the Trade Federation Cruiser, and the JEDI squeeze out, SLAMMING the hatch. Behind them, ANAKIN seals the hatch with his laser sword. 
OBI-WAN: That won't hold when the fuel hits those power dischargers. 
ANAKIN: The blast will break the hull. This side's pressurized. 
OBI-WAN: You still have much to learn, Anakin. 
16 INT. VENT SHAFT-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
The SUPER BATTLE DROIDS climb up the vent shaft. SUPER BATTLE DROID R77 and SEVERAL OTHER DROIDS wait in the generator room as the fuel continues to rise toward the power discharger. 
SUPER BATTLE DROID R77: I have a bad feeling about this. 
17 INT. GENERATOR ROOM-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
The fuel hits the SPARKING power discharger, and there is a HUGE EXPLOSION. 
18 EXT. TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER-BATTLE 
A GREAT EXPLOSION and a flaming gas cloud spray out of the side of the Federation Cruiser. 
19 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
A large bulge appears in the wall around the sealed hatch as the EXPLOSION hits. OBI-WAN jumps back, then stands amazed. 
OBI-WAN: All right, you win. I have much to learn. Let's go! 
ANAKIN grins at OBI-WAN, and they run down the hallway. 
20 INT. WIDE HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
The two JEDI wait for an elevator to arrive. They turn around and see they are face to face with THREE DESTROYER DROIDS. The DROIDS start blasting away. Anakin deflects the bolts. OBI-WAN frantically pushes the elevator button several more times. 
ANAKIN: Destroyers!! 
Finally the door opens, and they rush inside under a hail of laser bolts. The elevator door slides shut. The JEDI turn to see BATTLE DROIDS standing behind them. 
BATTLE DROID: Drop your weapons! I said drop 'em. 
The JEDI activate their light sabers and destroy all the BATTLE DROIDS. 
21 INT HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
R2-D2 notices two SUPER BATTLE DROIDS entering the hangar. He moves and hides behind a Jedi Starfighter. 
22 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
The elevator begins to move and screeches to a stop. 
OBI-WAN: Did you press the stop button? 
ANAKIN: No, did you? 
OBI-WAN: No! 
ANAKIN: Well, there's more than one way out of here. 
ANAKIN ignites his laser sword. 
OBI-WAN: We don't want to get out, we want to get moving. Artoo . . . Artoo. Do you copy? Activate elevator . . . (looks at control panel) . . . 31174 . . . 
ANAKIN cuts a hole in the elevator ceiling. 
23 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS are inspecting the Jedi starfighters. They overhear Obi-Wan's voice over the comlink and are distracted. 
SUPER BATTLE DROID 1: What's that? 
SUPER BATTLE DROID 2: Get back to work. It's nothing. 
24 INT. ELEVATOR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
OBI-WAN: Artoo? 
ANAKIN climbs through the hole in the ceiling of the elevator. 
OBI-WAN: (continuing) Always on the move. 
OBI-WAN continues to talk on the comlink. Artoo quietly beeps a reply. 
25 INT MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
ARTOO tries to muffle the comlink as the TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS try to figure out where the voices are coming from. ARTOO extends an arm and plugs into a computer interface. 
OBI-WAN: (OS) Artoo, switch on the comlink. Artoo, do you hear me? Artoo, we gave you a job to do! Artoo. 
ANAKIN: Here, Chancellor, lock this around your waist, and hold on. 
OBI-WAN: We'll head toward the bridge and see if we can find an escape pod. 
ANAKIN hands PALPATINE the end of a cable that is attached to his utility belt. PALPATINE attaches it around his waist. ANAKIN and OBI-WAN throw their utility cables to some pipes in the ceiling and swing to a second set of pipes. 
58 INT. MAIN HANGAR-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
OBI-WAN grabs onto the pipes that run along what was the ceiling and is now the wall. As he moves out into the hangar, TWO SUPER BATTLE DROIDS start firing at him. The Jedi ignites his lightsaber and deflects the bolts back at the DROIDS, blowing them up. ANAKIN and PALPATINE follow OBI-WAN along the pipes running along the ceiling of the hangar. PALPATINE struggles against the escaping air of the pressurized hangar. PALPATINE loses his grip as a pipe breaks, causing a rush of steam, but ANAKIN manages to maintain his grasp on the pipe as the CHANCELLOR dangles on the other end of the utility cable. They are surrounded by SPARKS and EXPLOSIONS as the ship twists and tries to break apart. ANAKIN moves out of the steam and struggles to pull PALPATINE back to safety. ANAKIN is almost pulled loose in the buffeting winds. The ceiling behind them buckles, causing pipes to break, creating geysers of steam. Some bits of pipe go hurling into the blast doors and out into space. They make it through a hangar doorway and close it behind them. 
59 INT. HANGAR DOORWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN and PALPATINE are out of breath. 
ANAKIN/OBI-WAN: Well, that was close. 
They laugh. 
60 INT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
BODYGUARD: General, we found the Jedi. They're in hallway 328. 
GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Activate ray shields. 
61 INT. HALLWAY-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
They run down the hallway. Suddenly, ray shields drop around them, putting them in an electronic box in the middle of the hallway. 
ANAKIN: Ray shields! 
OBI-WAN takes a deep breath to express his total disappointment. 
OBI-WAN: Wait a minute, how'd this happen! We're smarter than this. 
ANAKIN: Apparently not, Master. This is the oldest trap in the book . . . Well ... I was distracted. 
OBI-WAN: Oh, so all of a sudden it's my fault. 
ANAKIN: You're the Master. I'm just a hero. 
OBI-WAN: I'm open to suggestions here. 
PALPATINE: Why don't we let them take us to General Grievous. Perhaps with Count Dooku's demise, we can negotiate our release. 
The Jedi look at each other in disbelief. 
ANAKIN: I say . . . patience. 
OBI-WAN: Patience! That's your plan, is it? 
ANAKIN: Yes, Artoo will be along in a few moments and he'll release the ray shields . . . 
ARTOO comes skidding across the hallway and bashes into the opposite wall. He takes a moment to compose himself. 
ANAKIN: (continuing) See! No problem. 
Suddenly several doorways open, revealing TWO DESTROYER DROIDS. SIXTEEN SUPER BATTLE DROIDS emerge from behind the DESTROYER DROIDS. ARTOO turns and zaps one of the SUPER BATTLE DROIDS who then kicks ARTOO over. 
SUPER BATTLE DROID: Don't move, dummy. Ouch! Zap this. 
OBI-WAN: Do you have a plan B? 
62 EXT. BRIDGE-TRADE FEDERATION CRUISER 
OBI-WAN, ANAKIN PALPATINE, and ARTOO are captured by GENERAL GRIEVOUS. They stand before the ALIEN DROID GENERAL. 
GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Oh yes. General Kenobi, the Negotiator. We've been waiting for you. That wasn't much of a rescue. 
A BATTLE DROID walks to GENERAL GRIEVOUS and hands him the JEDI'S lightsabers. 
OBI-WAN: That depends upon your point of view. Hah! 
GENERAL GRIEVOUS: And Anakin Skywalker ... I was expecting someone with your reputation to be a little older. 
ANAKIN: General Grievous . . . Supreme Commander of the Droid Armies. You're shorter than I expected. 
GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Ahhhh, Jedi scum . . . 
OBI-WAN: Anakin, try not to upset him. We have a job to do. 
GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Your lightsabers will make a fine addition to my collection. 
OBI-WAN: Not this time. And this time you won't escape. 
ANAKIN: Artoo. 
ARTOO creates a distraction by extending all his arms, shooting out electrical pulses, and bouncing around. OBI-WAN, hands restrained with electrobonds, spins around, reaches out and, using the Force, yanks his lightsaber out of the General's hand, ignites it, and cuts his bonds. He continues to spin around and cuts Anakin free. 
GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Crush them! Make them suffer! 
ANAKIN uses the Force to yank his lightsaber out of the General's hand. 
The DROIDS that surround them begin to FIRE. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN jump into the line of fire. The bridge degenerates into chaos. OBI-WAN and ANAKIN are locked in a pitched battle between electro staffs and laser swords with GENERAL GRIEVOUS's TWO BODYGUARDS. 
CHANCELLOR PALPATINE is taken away by two BATTLE DROIDS. GENERAL GRIEVOUS walks around the bridge directing the BATTLE DROIDS. 
GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Stay and watch your stations. 
OBI-WAN fights one of General Grievous's BODYGUARDS. The BODYGUARD carries an electrified staff about five feet long. When the laser sword hits it, electrical bolts fly everywhere and surround the laser sword. OBI-WAN is unable to cut the staff. The Jedi gets whacked pretty good a couple of times and is knocked halfway across the bridge. OBI-WAN pulls himself together and attacks again, cutting off the DROID BODYGUARD'S head. The DROID BODYGUARD keeps attacking. ANAKIN struggles to defend himself against the other manic DROID BODYGUARD. He cuts the DROID BODYGUARD in half. TWO BATTLE DROIDS try to take the CHANCELLOR away. ANAKIN follows them down the hallway and cuts them down, rescuing the Chancellor. OBI-WAN finishes off the headless BODYGUARD. It crumbles to the floor in pieces. ALARMS SOUND as the giant spacecraft begins to list and fall out of orbit. A PILOT yells at GENERAL GRIEVOUS. 
A large landing platform in the industrial part of the city is surrounded by Emergency Fire Speeders. The smoking ship approaches as five Fireships spray it with foam. The ship finally makes a rather hard landing. 
OBI-WAN: Another happy landing. 
69 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-LATE AFTERNOON 
The small Jedi Shuttle carrying PALPATINE and the JEDI arrives at the landing platform. There are a DOZEN SENATORS, including BAIL ORGANA, JAR JAR BINKS, and C-3PO, waiting for them. PALPATINE, R2-D2, and ANAKIN get out. OBI-WAN and MACE stay in the doorway of the Jedi Shuttle. 
ANAKIN: (to Obi-Wan) Are you coming, Master? 
OBI-WAN: Oh no. I'm not brave enough for politics. I have to report to the Council. Besides, someone needs to be the poster boy. 
ANAKIN: Hold on, this whole operation was your idea. You planned it. You led the rescue operation. You have to be the one to take the bows this time. 
OBI-WAN: Sorry, old friend. Let us not forget that you rescued me from the Buzz Droids. And you killed Count Dooku. And you rescued the Chancellor, carrying me unconscious on your back, and you managed to land that bucket of bolts safely . . . 
ANAKIN: All because of your training, Master. You deserve all those speeches of your greatness. 
OBI-WAN: . . . the endless speeches . . . Anakin, let's be fair. Today, you are the hero and you deserve your glorious day with the politicians. 
ANAKIN: All right. But you owe me . . . and not for saving your skin for the tenth time . . . 
OBI-WAN: Ninth time . . . that business on Cato Nemoidia doesn't count. I'll see you at the briefing. 
ANAKIN smiles and walks away from OBI-WAN. The CHANCELLOR and his entourage approach MACE. 
MACE WlNDU: Chancellor Palpatine, what a welcome sight! Are you all right? 
PALPATINE: Yes, thanks to your two Jedi Knights. They killed Count Dooku, but General Grievous has escaped once again. 
MACE WlNDU: General Grievous will run and hide as he always does. He is a coward. 
PALPATINE: That maybe true, but with Count Dooku dead, he is the leader of the Droid Army, and I assure you, the Senate will vote to continue the war as long as Grievous is alive. 
MACE WlNDU: Then the Jedi Council will make finding Grievous our highest priority. 
BAIL, ANAKIN, and the crowd walk away from the platform toward the Senate Building Grand Hallway. 
BAIL ORGANA: Skywalker, the Republic cannot praise you enough. 
ANAKIN and BAIL ORGANA, walking in the hallway. 
ANAKIN: Thank you, Senator Organa. The kidnapping was a bold move by the Separatists, but it was a mistake that Obi-Wan and I were able to take advantage of. 
ARTOO and THREEPIO follow behind the crowd. 
C-3PO: It couldn't possibly be as bad as all that. 
ARTOO beeps. 
C-3PO: (continuing) Well, there, I agree with you. In fact, I could do with a tune-up myself. 
70 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-MAIN HALLWAY-LATE AFTERNOON 
ANAKIN is at the back of the crowd of SENATORS, talking with BAIL ORGANA. R2-D2 and C-3PO scoot along ahead of them. 
BAIL ORGANA: The end of Count Dooku will surely bring an end to this war, and an end to the Chancellor's draconian security measures. 
ANAKIN: I wish that were so, but the fighting is going to continue until General Grievous is spare parts . . . The Chancellor is very clear about that. 
Behind a row of large columns, a SHADOWY FIGURE follows the JEDI and the SENATOR. ANAKIN senses the figure. 
BAIL ORGANA: I'll do everything I can with the Senate. 
ANAKIN: Excuse me. 
BAIL ORGANA: Certainly. 
ANAKIN stops, and BAIL goes off after PALPATINE and the others. ANAKIN goes behind one of the giant columns to meet up with the SHADOWY FIGURE, who is revealed to be SENATOR PADME AMDALA. They embrace and kiss. 
PADME: Oh, Anakin! Thank goodness, you're back. 
ANAKIN: I missed you, Padme. I've missed you so. 
PADME: There were whispers . . . that you'd been killed. I've been living with unbearable dread. 
ANAKIN: I'm back, I'm all right. It feels like we've been apart for a lifetime. And it might have been ... If the Chancellor hadn't been kidnapped. I don't think they would have ever brought us back from the Outer Rim sieges. 
ANAKIN starts to give her another kiss. She steps back. 
PADME: Wait, not here . . . 
He grabs her again. 
ANAKIN: Yes, here! I'm tired of all this deception. I don't care if they know we're married. 
PADME: Anakin, don't say things like that. You're important to the Republic ... to ending this war. I love you more than anything, but I won't let you give up your life as a Jedi for me . . . 
ANAKIN: I've given my life to the Jedi order, but I'd only give up my life, for you. 
PADME: (playfully) I wouldn't like that. I wouldn't like that one bit. Patience, my handsome Jedi . . . Come to me later. 
ANAKIN embraces her, then looks at her. 
ANAKIN: Are you all right? You're trembling. What's going on? 
PADME: I'm just excited to see you. 
ANAKIN: That's not it. I sense more . . . what is it? 
PADME: Anakin?? 
She gets out of bed and goes downstairs to look for him. 
76 EXT. CORUSCANT-PADME'S APARTMENT-VERANDA-NIGHT 
ANAKIN walks down a flight of stairs onto a large veranda. The vast city planet of Coruscant, smoldering from the battle, is spread out before him. He is distraught. PADME descends the stairs and joins ANAKIN on the veranda. She takes his hand. He doesn't look at her. 
PADME: What's bothering you? 
ANAKIN: Nothing . . . 
ANAKIN touches the japor snippet around PADME'S neck, that Anakin gave her when he was a small boy. 
ANAKIN: (continuing) I remember when I gave this to you. 
PADME: Anakin, how long is it going to take for us to be honest with each other? 
ANAKIN: It was a dream. 
PADME: Bad? 
ANAKIN: Like the ones I used to have about my mother just before she died. 
PADME: And? 
ANAKIN: It was about you. 
They look at each other. A moment of concern passes between them. 
PADME: Tell me. 
ANAKIN: It was only a dream. 
PADME gives him a long, worried look. ANAKIN takes a deep breath. 
ANAKIN: (continuing) You die in childbirth . . . 
PADME: And the baby? 
ANAKIN: I don't know. 
PADME: It was only a dream. 
ANAKIN takes PADME in his arms. 
ANAKIN: . . . I won't let this one become real, Padme. 
They embrace, then part. 
PADME: Anakin, this baby will change our lives. I doubt the Queen will continue to allow me to serve in the Senate, and if the Council discovers you are the father, you will be expelled from the Jedi Order. 
ANAKIN: I know . 
PADME: Anakin, do you think Obi-Wan might be able to help us? 
ANAKIN: (suspicious) Have you told him anything? 
PADME: No, but he's your mentor, your best friend . . . he must suspect something. 
ANAKIN: He's been a father to me, but he's still on the Council. Don't tell him anything! 
PADME: I won't, Anakin. 
ANAKIN: I don't need his help . . . Our baby is a blessing, not a problem. 
77 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-YODAS QUARTERS-DAY 
YODA and ANAKIN sit in Yoda 's room, deep in thought. 
YODA: Premonitions . . . premonitions . . . Hmmmm . . . these visions you have . . . 
ANAKIN: They are of pain, suffering, death . . . 
YODA: Yourself you speak of, or someone you know? 
ANAKIN: Someone . . . 
YODA: . . . close to you? 
ANAKIN: Yes. 
YODA: Careful you must be when sensing the future, Anakin. The fear of loss is a path to the dark side. 
ANAKIN: I won't let these visions come true, Master Yoda. 
YODA: Death is a natural part of life. Rejoice for those around you who transform into the Force. Mourn them, do not. Miss them, do not. Attachment leads to jealousy. The shadow of greed, that is. 
ANAKIN: What must I do, Master Yoda? 
YODA: Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose. 
78 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY-DAY 
ANAKIN hurries down a temple hallway, heading toward a Jedi Briefing Room. SEVERAL JEDI are exiting. 
79 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-BRIEFING ROOM-DAY 
ANAKIN rushes into the Briefing Room. By the time he reaches the Chamber, the last of the Jedi are leaving. Only OBI-WAN remains at the front of the lecture hall. He is shutting off some holograms and electronic charts and maps. 
MON MOTHMA: We are not Separatists trying to leave the Republic. We are loyalists, trying to preserve democracy in the Republic. 
BAIL ORGANA: It has become increasingly clear to many of us that the Chancellor has become an enemy of democracy. 
PADME: I can't believe it has come to this! Chancellor Palpatine is one of my oldest advisors. He served as my Ambassador when I was Queen. 
GlDDEAN DANU: Senator, I fear you underestimate the amount of corruption that has taken hold in the Senate. 
MON MOTHMA: The Chancellor has played the Senators well. They know where the power lies, and they will do whatever it takes to share in it. Palpatine has become a dictator and we have helped him to do it. 
BAIL ORGANA: We can't sit around debating any longer, we have decided to do what we can to stop it. Senator Mon Mothma and I are putting together an organization . . . 
PADME: Say no more. Senator Organa. I understand. At this point, it's better to leave some things unsaid. 
BAIL ORGANA: Yes. I agree and we must not discuss this with anyone, without everyone in this group agreeing. 
MON MOTHMA: That means those closest to you . . . even family ... no one can be told. 
They ALL nod their heads. PADME considers this for a moment. 
PADME: Agreed. 
82 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-HALLWAY OUTSIDE COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY 
ANAKIN stands pensively in front of the Jedi Council Chambers. The door opens. 
83 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COUNCIL CHAMBERS-DAY 
ANAKIN enters and stands in the middle of the room. He is surrounded by the Jedi Council MACE WINDU, EETH KOTH OBI-WAN, YODA, the HOLOGRAMS of PLO KOON and KI-ADI-MUNDI. 
MACE: Anakin Skywalker, we have approved your appointment to the Council as the Chancellor's personal representative. 
ANAKIN: I will do my best to uphold the principles of the Jedi Order. 
YODA: Allow this appointment lightly, the Council does not. Disturbing is this move by Chancellor Palpatine. 
ANAKIN: I understand. 
MACE: You are on this Council, but we do not grant you the rank of Master. 
Anakin reacts with anger. 
ANAKIN: What? ! How can you do this?? This is outrageous, it's unfair . . . I'm more powerful than any of you. How can you be on the Council and not be a Master? 
MACE: Take a seat, young Skywalker. 
ANAKIN: Forgive me, Master. 
ANAKIN goes and sits in one of the empty chairs. Everyone is embarrassed. KI-ADI-MUNDI WHO APPEARS AS A HOLOGRAM, speaks. 
Kl-ADI-MUNDI: We have surveyed all systems in the Republic, and have found no sign of General Grievous. 
YODA: Hiding in the Outer Rim, Grievous is. The outlying systems, you must sweep. 
OBI-WAN: It may take some time . . . we do not have many ships to spare. 
MACE: We cannot take ships from the front line. 
OBI-WAN: And yet, it would be fatal for us to allow the droid armies to regroup. 
YODA: Master Kenobi, our spies contact, you must, and then wait. 
Kl-ADI-MUNDI: What about the droid attack on the Wookiees? 
MACE: It is critical we send an attack group there, immediately! 
OBI-WAN: He's right, that is a system we cannot afford to lose. It's the main navigation route for the southwestern quadrant. 
ANAKIN: I know that system well. It would take us little time to drive the droids off that planet. 
MACE: Skywalker, your assignment is here with the Chancellor, and Kenobi must find General Grievous. 
YODA: Go, I will. Good relations with the Wookiees, I have. 
MACE: It is settled then. Yoda will take a battalion of clones to reinforce the Wookiees on Kashyyyk. May the Force be with us all. 
ANAKIN is disappointed. 
84 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-MASSIVE MAIN HALLWAY AND ALCOVE-LATE AFTERNOON 
ANAKIN and OBI-WAN walk through one of the massive Jedi Temple hallways. ANAKIN is furious. 
ANAKIN: What kind of nonsense is this, put me on the Council and not make me a Master!?? That's never been done in the history of the Jedi. It's insulting! 
OBI-WAN: Calm down, Anakin. You have been given a great honor. To be on the Council at your age . . . It's never happened before. Listen to me, Anakin. The fact of the matter is you're too close to the Chancellor. The Council doesn't like it when he interferes in Jedi affairs. 
ANAKIN: I swear to you, I didn't ask to be put on the Council . . . 
OBI-WAN: But it's what you wanted! Your friendship with Chancellor Palpatine seems to have paid off. 
ANAKIN: That has nothing to do with this. 
OBI-WAN: Anakin, regardless of how it happened, you find yourself in a delicate situation. 
ANAKIN: You mean divided loyalties. 
OBI-WAN: I warned you there was tension between the Council and the Chancellor. I was very clear. Why didn't you listen? You walked right into it. 
ANAKIN: The Council is upset I'm the youngest to ever serve. 
ANAKIN: How are you feeling? 
PADME: He keeps kicking. 
ANAKIN: He?! Why do you think it's a boy? 
PADME: (laughs) My motherly intuition. 
She puts his hand on her belly. 
ANAKIN: Whoa! With a kick that strong, it's got to be a girl. 
They laugh. 
PADME: I heard about your appointment. Anakin. I'm so proud of you. 
ANAKIN: I may be on the Council, but . . . they refused to accept me as a Jedi Master. 
PADME: Patience. In time, they will recognize your skills. 
ANAKIN: They still treat me as if I were a Padawan learner. . . they fear my power, that's the problem. 
PADME: Anakin . . . 
ANAKIN: Sometimes, I wonder what's happening to the Jedi Order . . . I think this war is destroying the principles of the Republic. 
PADME: Have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side? 
ANAKIN: (suspicious) What do you mean? 
PADME: What if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists, and the Republic has become the very evil we have been fighting to destroy? 
ANAKIN: I don't believe that. And you're sounding like a Separatist! 
PADME: Anakin, this war represents a failure to listen . . . Now, you're closer to the Chancellor than anyone. Please, please ask him to stop the fighting and let diplomacy resume. 
ANAKIN: (growing angry) Don't ask me to do that, Padme. Make a motion in the Senate, where that kind of a request belongs. I'm not your errand boy. I'm not anyone's errand boy! 
PADME: What is it? 
ANAKIN: Nothing. 
PADME: Don't do this . . . don't shut me out. Let me help you. 
ANAKIN: You can't help me . . . I'm trying to help you. 
They look in each other's eyes. 
ANAKIN: (continuing) I sense . . . there are things you are not telling me. 
PADME is startled at this. 
PADME: I sense there are things you are not telling me. 
PADME smiles. ANAKIN is a little embarrassed. 
PADME: (continuing) Hold me . . . like you did by the lake on Naboo, so long ago . . . when there was nothing but our love ... No politics, no plotting ... no war. 
88 INT. CORUSCANT-GALAXIES OPERA HOUSE-NIGHT 
ANAKIN lands his speeder and exits. ANAKIN runs up the stairs at the Galaxies Opera House. ANAKIN runs through the hallway and enters Palpatine's box, where the CHANCELLOR is sitting with Mas Amedda and Sly-Moore, watching the Man Calamari Ballet doing "Squid Lake." 
ANAKIN: You wanted to see me, Chancellor. 
PALPATINE: Yes, Anakin! Come closer. I have good news. Our Clone Intelligence Units have discovered the location of General Grievous. He is hiding in the Utapau system. 
ANAKIN: At last, we'll be able to capture that monster and end this war. 
PALPATINE: I would worry about the collective wisdom of the Council if they didn't select you for this assignment. You are the best choice by far  but, they can't always be trusted to do the right thing. 
ANAKIN: They try. 
PALPATINE: Sit down, (to his aides) Leave us. 
ANAKIN sits next to PALPATINE. The Chancellor leans over to him. 
PALPATINE: (continuing) Anakin, you know I'm not able to rely on the Jedi Council. If they haven't included you in their plot, they soon will. 
ANAKIN: I'm not sure I understand. 
PALPATINE: You must sense what I have come to suspect . . . the Jedi Council want control of the Republic . . . they're planning to betray me. 
ANAKIN: I don't think . . . 
PALPATINE: Anakin, search your feelings. You know, don't you? 
ANAKIN: I know they don't trust you . . . 
PALPATINE: Or the Senate . . . or the Republic . . . or democracy for that matter. 
ANAKIN: I have to admit my trust in them has been shaken. 
PALPATINE: Why? They asked you to do something that made you feel dishonest, didn't they? 
ANAKIN doesn't say anything. He simply looks down. 
PALPATINE: (continuing) They asked you to spy on me, didn't they? 
ANAKIN: I don't know ... I don't know what to say. 
OBI-WAN: You forget I trained the Jedi that defeated Count Dooku! 
OBI-WAN is hard-pressed to defend himself against the deadly onslaught. They fight across the control room as the BATTLE DROID SHARPSHOOTERS try to pick off the Jedi. OBI-WAN mounts a ferocious counterattack and cuts off one of GRIEVOUS's hands. A loud EXPLOSION is heard echoing throughout the sinkhole. GENERAL GRIEVOUS and OBI-WAN glance to the entrance of the control center and see CLONE TROOPS in the distance, attacking DROIDS in the sinkhole. On the far wall of the sinkhole, CLONES can be seen rappelling onto balconies. 
OBI-WAN: I may not defeat your droids, but my troops certainly will. 
GENERAL GRIEVOUS: Army or not, you must realize you are doomed. 
OBI-WAN: I don't think so. 
TWENTY CLONES suddenly rappel into the entrance of the control center, ray guns blazing. Chaos. Laser bolts fly everywhere as the DROIDS return fire. OBI-WAN attacks GENERAL GRIEVOUS, who defends himself rigorously with one of his bodyguard's electro-staffs. OBI-WAN uses the Force to hurl GENERAL GRIEVOUS backwards. He falls onto a lower platform and OBI-WAN jumps down after him. 
113 INT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-CONTROL CENTER-DAY 
More CLONES rappel into the control center and blast away at the remaining DROIDS. The JEDI cuts down several DROIDS as he races to the entrance of the control center. OBI-WAN spots GENERAL GRIEVOUS racing toward one of the landing platforms in the midst of the battle. GENERAL GRIEVOUS jumps onto a WHEEL SCOOTER and takes off down the wall of the sinkhole. OBI-WAN whistles for his LIZARD BOGA, who runs to him. OBI-WAN jumps on. 
114 EXT. UTAPAU-CLIFF AND LANDING PLATFORM-DAY 
The chase begins. Obi-Wan drops his lightsaber while riding Boga. 
115 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-SUNSET 
The sun is setting as the lights come on in the massive Senate Office Building. The sky is red. 
116 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-SUNSET 
PALPATINE listens to a delegation from the Senate, which includes PADME and five other Senators: NEE ALAVAR, FANG ZAR, MALEDEE, SWEITT CONCORKILL, and MON CALAMARI. ANAKIN stands to one side of PALPATINE. 
PALPATINE: I understand your reservations completely, Senator, and I assure you the appointment of Governors will in no way compete with the duties of the Senate. 
PADME: May I take it then, that there will be no further amendments to the Constitution? 
PALPATINE: I want this terrible conflict to end as much as you do, My Lady, and when it does I guarantee an immediate return to democracy . . . 
PADME: You are pursuing a diplomatic solution to the war, then. 
PALPATINE: You must trust me to do the right things, Senator. That is why I am here. 
FANGZAR: But surely . . . 
The Chancellor turns on FANG ZAR. 
PALPATINE: I have said I will do what is right, that should be enough for your . . . committee. 
PADME: On behalf of the "delegation of two thousand," I thank you, Chancellor. 
PALPATINE: I thank you for bringing this to my attention, Senator. 
PADME gives ANAKIN a frustrated look, then turns and exits with the other FIVE SENATORS. PALPATINE turns to ANAKIN. 
PALPATINE: (continuing) Their sincerity is to be admired, although I sense there is more to their request than they are telling us. 
ANAKIN: What do you mean? 
PALPATINE: They are not to be trusted. 
ANAKIN: Surely Senator Amidala can be trusted . . . 
PALPATINE: These are unstable times for the Republic, Anakin. Some see instability as an opportunity. Senator Amidala is hiding something. I can see it in her eyes. 
ANAKIN: I'm sure you're mistaken. 
PALPATINE: I'm surprised your Jedi insights are not more sensitive to such things. 
ANAKIN: I simply don't sense betrayal in Senator Amidala. 
PALPATINE studies ANAKIN carefully and gives him a skeptical look. 
PALPATINE: Yes, you do, but you don't seem to want to admit it. There is much conflict in you, Anakin. 
117 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI WAR ROOM-EARLY EVENING 
KI-ADI-MUNDI, ANAKIN, YODA, MACE, CLONE COMMANDER CODY, and AAYLA SECURA talk via holograms. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Master Windu, may I interrupt? General Kenobi has made contact with General Grievous, and we have begun our attack. 
MACE WlNDU: Thank you, Commander. Anakin, deliver this report to the Chancellor. His reaction will give us a clue to his intentions. 
ANAKIN: Yes, Master. 
ANAKIN leaves the room. COMMANDER CODY's hologram disappears. 
MACE WINDU: I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The dark side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor. 
Kl-ADI-MUNDI: If he does not give up his emergency powers after the destruction of Grievous, then he should be removed from office. 
MACE WiNDU: That could be a dangerous move ... the Jedi Council would have to take control of the Senate in order to secure a peaceful transition . . . 
Kl-ADI-MUNDI: . . . and replace the Congress with Senators who are not filled with greed and corruption. 
YODA: To a dark place this line of thought will carry us. Hmmmmm. . . . great care we must take. 
118 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING 
ANAKIN brings news to PALPATINE. 
ANAKIN: Chancellor, we have just received a report from Master Kenobi. He has engaged General Grievous. 
PALPATINE: We can only hope that Master Kenobi is up to the challenge. 
124 INT. JEDI GUNSHIP-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING 
MACE and the JEDI (AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, AND SAESEE TIIN) are preparing to board a JEDI GUNSHIP to the CHANCELLOR's office. ANAKIN enters the hangar. 
ANAKIN: Master Windu, I must talk to you. 
MACE WiNDU: What is it, Skywalker? We are in a hurry. We have just received word that Obi-Wan has destroyed General Grievous. We are on our way to make sure the Chancellor returns emergency powers back to the Senate. 
ANAKIN: He won't give up his power. I've just learned a terrible truth. I think Chancellor Palpatine is a Sith Lord. 
MACE WINDU: A Sith Lord? 
ANAKIN: Yes. The one we have been looking for. 
MACE WiNDU: How do you know this? 
ANAKIN: He knows the ways of the Force. He has been trained to use the dark side. 
MACE WiNDU: Are you sure? 
ANAKIN: Absolutely. 
MACE WiNDU: Then our worst fears have been realized. We must move quickly if the Jedi Order is to survive. 
ANAKIN: Master, the Chancellor is very powerful. You will need my help if you are going to arrest him. 
MACE WiNDU: For your own good, stay out of this affair. I sense a great deal of confusion in you, young Skywalker. There is much fear that clouds your judgment. 
ANAKIN: I must go, Master. 
MACE WiNDU: No. If what you told me is true, you will have gained my trust, but for now remain here. 
ANAKIN: Yes, Master. 
MACE WiNDU: Wait for us in the Council Chamber until we return. 
ANAKIN: Yes, Master. 
ANAKIN watches as the JEDI leave in their ship. 
125 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI COUNCIL/PADME'S APARTMENT-EARLY EVENING 
(INTERCUT) 
PADME is alone in her apartment, thinking of Anakin. ANAKIN sits alone in the Jedi Council Chamber thinking of PADME. 
PALPATINE: (V.O.) You do know, don't you, if the Jedi destroy me, any chance of saving her will be lost. 
PADME: I truly, deeply love you. Before I die. I want you to know. 
C-3PO: My Lady, are you. . . . Are you all right? 
ANAKIN: I can't do this ... I can't let her die. 
ANAKIN rushes out of the Council Chamber and to his speeder. The hangar door opens and he lifts off. 
126 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-LANDING PLATFORM-EARLY EVENING 
The sky is still blue as a JEDI GUNSHIP lands on the Senate Office Building landing platform. FOUR JEDI exit the SHUTTLE and enter the Senate Office Building. MACE WINDU, AGEN KOLAR, KIT FISTO, and SAESEE TIIN, like gunfighters out of the Old West, walk through the massive hallway, four across. 
127 INT. CORUSCANT-LOBBY TO CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE-EARLY EVENING 
The FOUR JEDI enter the lobby, raising their arms, and send the Chancellor's aide, DAR WAC, flying against the wall, along with TWO REPUBLIC GUARDS. They storm into the Chancellor's office. 
128 INT. CORUSCANT-CHANCELLORS OFFICE-EARLY EVENING 
MACE arrives with THREE JEDI to arrest PALPATINE. 
PALPATINE: Master Windu. I take it General Grievous has been destroyed then. I must say, you're here sooner than expected. 
MACE WINDU: In the name of the Galactic Senate of the Republic, you are under arrest, Chancellor. 
MACE WINDU and the other JEDI ignite their lightsabers. 
PALPATINE: Are you threatening me, Master Jedi? 
MACE: The Senate will decide your fate. 
PALPATINE: (burst of anger) I am the Senate! 
MACE: Not yet! 
PALPATINE stands, a laser sword appears out of his cloak sleeve, and he spins toward the JEDI. 
PALPATINE: It's treason, then. 
A close shot of PALPATINE as the fight begins. Close shots of THREE JEDI getting cut down by PALPATINE. PALPATINE and MACE continue to fight. 
Jedi Master MACE WINDU and the Sith Lord fight their way down the hallway and into the main office area. PALPATINE is able to use the Force to slam MACE against the wall, but he recovers before the Chancellor can cut him down. 
ANAKIN lands his speeder, jumps out, and runs down a long corridor toward the Chancellor's office. 
In the heat of battle, MACE cuts the window behind the Chancellor's desk, and it crashes away. MACE is forced out onto the ledge, which is twenty stories up. They fight over the precipice. ANAKIN arrives to see PALPATINE and MACE fighting. 
They stop as MACE forces PALPATINE to drop his sword. PALPATINE and MACE start yelling at each other. 
MACE WINDU: You are under arrest, My Lord. 
PALPATINE: Anakin! I told you it would come to this. I was right. The Jedi are taking over. 
PALPATINE: We must move quickly. The Jedi are relentless; if they are not all destroyed, it will be civil war without end. First, I want you to go to the Jedi Temple. We will catch them off balance. Do what must be done, Lord Vader. Do not hesitate. Show no mercy. Only then will you be strong enough with the dark side to save Padme. 
ANAKIN: What about the other Jedi spread across the galaxy? 
PALPATINE: Their betrayal will be dealt with. After you have killed all the Jedi in the Temple, go to the Mustafar system. Wipe out Viceroy Gunray and the other Separatist leaders. Once more, the Sith will rule the galaxy, and we shall have peace. 
131 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE ENTRY-NIGHT 
ANAKIN goes to the Jedi Temple with a battalion of Clone Troopers. 
132 EXT. UTAPAU-TENTH LEVEL-LANDIXG PLATFORM-DAY 
The battle between the CLONES and the DROIDS rages throughout the sinkhole. OBI-WAN rides up to CLONE COMMANDER CODY. 
OBI-WAN: Commander, contact your troops. Tell them to move to the higher levels. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Very good, sir. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY starts to move away, then remembers something and returns to OBI-WAN. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: (continuing) Oh, by the way, I think you'll be needing this. 
He hands OBI-WAN his lightsaber, and the LIZARD rears up. 
OBI-WAN: Thank you, Cody, (smiling) Now let's get a move on. We've got a battle to win here. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Yes, sir! 
OBI-WAN and the LIZARD ride off down the wall of the giant sinkhole. The battle rages throughout the city. CLONE COMMANDER CODY (2224,) takes out his comlink and listens to the HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS as, far below, OBI-WAN can been seen battling DROIDS on a landing platform. 
DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander Cody, the time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: It will be done, My Lord. 
The HOLOGRAM disappears, and CLONE COMMANDER CODY gestures to a nearby Clone Trooper. 
CLONE COMMANDER CODY: Blast him! 
The battle rages all around OBI-WAN. DROIDS and CLONES are everywhere. OBI-WAN is riding on a LIZARD, cutting down DROIDS as he races across the battlefield. Suddenly a volley of laser blasts from behind him knocks him and his LIZARD off the wall of the sinkhole. He looks around just in time to see his CLONE TROOPS are firing on him. OBI-WAN falls hundreds of feet to the bottom of the water-filled sinkhole. 
133 EXT. MYGEETO-DAWN 
The sky slowly awakens on the crystal world of Mygeeto. A battle rages. Clone troops battle the droid armies across a long bridge. KI-ADI-MUNDi uses his light saber to deflect enemy fire. CLONE COMMANDER BACARA (1138) exits a Gunship near the entrance to the city. He rallies his TROOPS to attack the city, then gets a message on his comlink. He stops and moves to one side as a HOLOGRAM OF DARTH SIDIOUS appears on the comlink in the palm of his hand. He moves further into the shadows. 
DARTH SlDIOUS: Commander 1138 . . . 
CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: Yes, sir. 
DARTH SlDIOUS: The time has come. Execute Order Sixty-Six. 
CLONE COMMANDER BACARA: It will be done, My Lord. 
DARTH SIDIOUS fades, and the CLONE COMMANDER snaps the comlink closed and looks to the main plaza of the city, where KI-ADI-MUNDI is leading the charge. The clones stop. KI-ADI-MUNDI turns around and is blasted by clone fire. He's killed before he can defend himself. 
134 EXT. FELUCIA-FOREST-DAY 
A column of CLONE WALKERS marches across the forest floor. The STRANGE CALLS of the alien forest creatures of FELUCIA suddenly stop. The Jedi AAYLA SECURA and her CLONE TROOPS brace for an ambush. 
AAYLA: Steady. . . . steady . . . 
They all look around for signs of the enemy. CLONE COMMANDER BLY moves up behind the Jedi. 
AAYLA: (continuing) Bly, do you think they're Droids? 
BLY: No. 
BLY blasts AAYLA in the back. The OTHER CLONES fire on her as she hits the ground. 
Another Jedi, BARRISS OFFEE, is cutting down a patrol of DROIDS when a CLONE WALKING TANK and SEVEN CLONE TROOPERS round a corner and blast the Jedi away.

The battle appears to be over. WOOKIEES stack destroyed Droids while CLONES assess the damage to their equipment. A Jedi, LUMINARA UNDULI, talks with EIGHT CLONE OFFICERS standing in a circle around her. Suddenly they reveal their hidden pistols and blast her before she can react. 
The Jedi QUINLAN VOS is riding on top of a CLONE TURBO TANK. The main cannon of a second tank slowly swings to point right at him and a COUPLE OF CLONES. The cannon fires, and QUINLAN VOS and the CLONES disappear in a huge EXPLOSION. 
137 INT. CATO NEIMOIDIA-COCKPIT CLONE FIGHTER-DAY 
The CLONE PILOT watches a hologram of DARTH SIDIOUS.

The FOUR CLONE PILOTS with PLO KOON drop back and blast him out of the sky. 
140 EXT. SALEUCAMI-FOREST 
AT-ST CLONE SERGEANT: Everyone out of there! 
A CRAZY LITTLE CREATURE about two feet high pops its head over the rail. The creature is covered with mud. His long hair is frizzed out in all directions. 
CREATURE: Wookiee good . . . eat Wookiee. (crazy little laugh) 
CLONE SERGEANT: Did you find something? 
CREATURE: It's nothing, nothing. (laughs) 
CLONE SERGEANT: It's nothing, nothing. All these Wookiees are dead. Move to the east. 
CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir. 
Suddenly, CHEWBACCA climbs up behind the AT-ST CLONE, dripping wet, and throws the CLONE SERGEANT into the water. CHEWIE BARKS. 
CREATURE: Right you are, Chewbacca. Faster that will be. 
TARFFUL jumps up in the boat, and the CREATURE takes off his hair. It is Yoda. 
YODA: Stink, this mud does. A moment to bathe, give me. 
YODA, covered with mud, jumps into the water. TARFFUL climbs onto the AT-ST with CHEWBACCA. YODA is out of the water and putting his robes back on. 
YODA: (continuing) Not far, are we, from the emergency ship. Quickly . . . 
YODA whistles and a large ALIEN FLYING INSECT called CAN-CELL appears. YODA jumps on the insect's back and they take off. The WOOKIEES follow on the AT-ST. The CLONES continue to search the swamp. 
153 EXT. KASHYYYK-HILLS OVERLOOKING LAKE-DUSK 
The AT-ST marches up the hill and stops. The WOOKIEES jump down. YODA lands on CAN-CELL nearby. CHEWBACCA goes to a tree and pulls down one of its branches. The ground opens up, and a small WOOKIEE ESCAPE POD rises into the field. YODA opens the door of the pod. 
YODA: Good-bye. Chewbacca and Tarfful, miss you I will. Good friends you are. For your help, much gratitude and respect, I have. 
The Wookiees BARK as the Jedi climbs into the WOOKIEE POD and takes off into the dusk sky.

BAIL ORGANA is greeted by CAPTAIN ANTILLES and TWO ALDERAAN TROOPERS. 
BAIL ORGANA: Were you able to get hold of a Jedi homing beacon? 
CAPTAIN ANTILLES: Yes, sir. We've encountered no opposition. The clones are still a bit confused. It appears no one is in command. 
BAIL ORGANA: That will change soon. Hopefully we will be able to intercept a few Jedi before they walk into this catastrophe. 
157 EXT. UTAPAU-SINKHOLE WALL-LATE DAY 
OBI-WAN hides from a group of CLONE TROOPERS. 
CLONE CAPTAIN: Did you find Kenobi? 
CLONE TROOPER: No one could have survived that fall. 
He watches them pass. 
CLONE CAPTAIN: Start loading your men on the ship. 
CLONE TROOPER: Yes, sir. 
OBI-WAN tries to sneak back to the secret platform, down a flight of stairs. 
158 EXT. UTAPAU-SECRET LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY 
OBI-WAN makes his way out of the cave and onto General Grievous's secret landing platform. He runs to the Starfighter and climbs into the one-man ship. The Starfighter takes off and disappears into the sky.

OBI-WAN flies away from the planet Utapau in General Grievous's tiny Starfighter. 
160 INT. GENERAL GRIEVOUS'S STARFIGHTER-SPACE 
OBI-WAN activates the controls on the Starfighter. He punches in several coordinates and codes. A BEEPING SOUND is heard. It quickly speeds up until it is a steady tone. OBI-WAN speaks into his comlink. 
OBI-WAN: Emergency Code Nine Thirteen ... I have no contact on any frequency. Are there any Jedi out there? . . . anywhere . . . 
A BURST OF STATIC is heard- and a FUZZY HOLOGRAM image appears. 
BAIL: (hologram) . . . Kenobi . . . 
OBI-WAN: (continuing) I've locked on. Repeat. 
The FUZZY HOLOGRAM image comes into focus, and it is BAIL ORGANA. 
BAIL ORGANA: Master Kenobi?? 
C-3PO: (continuing) My Lady, is there anything I might do? 
PADME: No thank you, Threepio. 
G-3PO: A snack, perhaps? 
PADME: No. 
THREEPIO starts to move off. 
C-3PO: I feel so helpless.

OBI-WAN's ship docks with Bail Organa's Starcruiser. 
164 INT. ALDERAAN-STARCRUISER-HALLWAY-DAY

BAIL ORGANA: You made it. 
YODA: Master Kenobi, dark times are these. Good to see you. it is. 
OBI-WAN: You were attacked by your Clones, also? 
YODA: With the help of the Wookiees, barely escape, I did. 
OBI-WAN: How many other Jedi managed to survive? 
YODA: Heard from no one, have we. 
BAIL ORGANA: I saw thousands of troops attack the Jedi Temple. That's why I went looking for Yoda. 
OBI-WAN: Have we had any contact from the Temple? 
YODA: Received a coded retreat message, we have. 
BAIL ORGANA: It requests all Jedi to return to the Temple. It says that the war is over . . . 
OBI-WAN: Well, then we must go back! If there are other stragglers, they will fall into the trap and be killed. 
BAIL ORGANA: It's too dangerous to return. 
YODA: Suggest dismantling the coded signal, do you? 
OBI-WAN: Yes, Master. There is too much at stake here, and we need a clearer picture of what has happened. 
YODA: I agree. In a dark place we find ourselves ... a little more knowledge might light our way. 
165 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LAVA FIELDS-DAY 
Workers move across the lava beds, gathering the magma. A column of aliens riding giant MUSTAFAR FLEAS marches forward. 
166 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY 
A HOLOGRAM of DARTH SIDIOUS is in the center of the room. NUTE GUNRAY and the REST OF THE SEPARATIST COALITION watch SIDIOUS. 
NUTE GUNRAY: The plan has gone as you had promised, My Lord. 
DARTH SIDIOUS: You have done well, Viceroy. When my new apprentice, Darth Vader, arrives, he will take care of you. 
The hologram disappears. 
167 INT. CRUISER-COCKPIT 
The Republic Cruiser heads toward Coruscant. OBI-WAN, BAIL, YODA, and TWO PILOTS sit in the cockpit. 
PILOT: We are receiving a message from the Chancellor's office, sir. 
BAIL ORGANA: Send it through. 
PILOT: Yes, sir. 
The PILOT pushes some buttons. MAS AMEDDA appears on screen. 
MAS AMEDDA: Senator Organa . . . the Supreme Chancellor of the Republic requests your presence at a special session of Congress. 
BAIL ORGANA: Tell the Chancellor I will be there. 
MAS AMEDDA: Very well. He will be expecting you. 
MAS AMEDDA's image disappears from the screen. 
BAIL ORGANA: It could be a trap. 
OBI-WAN: No, I don't think so. The Chancellor will not be able to control the thousands of star systems without keeping the Senate intact. 
YODA: If a special session of Congress there is, easier for us to enter the Jedi Temple it will be. 
168 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE LANDING PLATFORM-LATE DAY 
OBI-WAN, BAIL, and YODA land on Coruscant. The elevator door opens, and they step out. 
GUARD: Welcome back, Senator. May I see your clearance? 
BAIL ORGANA: Certainly. 
GUARD: Thank you, you may proceed. We will take custody of the Jedi. 
PALPATINE: The war is over. (applause) The Separatists have been defeated, (applause) and the Jedi rebellion has been foiled. We stand on the threshold of a new beginning. 
There is a long period of APPLAUSE. 
PADME: Well, this is the moment we discover if he intends to return the Republic to a democracy. 
PALPATINE: In order to ensure our security and continuing stability, the Republic will be reorganized into the first Galactic Empire, for a safe and secure society which I assure you will last for ten thousand years. 
There is a loud, sustained CHEER from the Senate. BAIL ORGANA and PADME sit, dumbfounded. 
PALPATINE: (continuing) An empire that will continue to be ruled by this august body, and a sovereign ruler chosen for life . . . 
The Senate CHEERS again. BAIL and PADME are devastated. PADME begins to cry. 
PALPATINE: (continuing) An empire ruled by the majority . . . Ruled by a new constitution . . . 
The Senate APPLAUDS. 
PADME: So this is how liberty dies, with thunderous applause . . . 
BAIL ORGANA: We cannot let this happen. 
He starts to stand up. PADME stops him. 
PADME: Not now! There will be a time. 
182 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-CONFERENCE ROOM-DAY 
After everyone in the Main Control Room is dead, ANAKIN moves to the small conference room where WAT TAMBOR. SHU MAI, and some OTHER SEPARATISTS are hiding. RUNE HAAKO tries to run but is trapped by a dead-end as ANAKIN advances. 
RUNE HAAKO: Stop! Enough, this is not right! 
RUNE is cut down. NUTE GUNRAY crawls out from under the table and opens the Main Door, allowing DESTROYER DROIDS to enter. WAT TAMBOR is cut down, along with SHU MAI. DESTROYER DROIDS appear in the doorway and blast away, causing total destruction. When the firing is over, ANAKIN is gone. Blown away? No. ANAKIN drops from the ceiling behind the TWO DROIDS and cuts them to pieces before they know what hit them. 
183 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-HALLWAY-DAY 
NUTE GUNRAY is the last Separatist leader alive. ANAKIN moves on to find NUTE GUNRAY hiding in an alcove.

NUTE GUNRAY is cut down in midsentence. 
184 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-COMPUTER ROOM-NIGHT 
OBI-WAN stands in a large computer area as YODA looks on, in the hatchway to the Main Control Center. 
OBI-WAN: I've recalibrated the code warning all surviving Jedi to stay away. 
YODA: Good . . . For the Clones to discover the recalibration, a long time it will take. To change it back, longer still. Hurry. 
185 INT. CORUSCANT-JEDI TEMPLE-CONTROL CENTER-NIGHT 
OBI-WAN enters the Main Control Center with YODA and heads for the hologram area. 
OBI-WAN: Wait, Master. There is something I must know . . . 
YODA: If into the security recordings you go, only pain will you find. 
OBI-WAN: I must know the truth, Master. 
OBI-WAN moves to a panel and flips some switches. He sees a HOLOGRAM of ANAKIN slaughtering JEDI, including the YOUNG ONES. OBI-WAN and YODA react. 
OBI-WAN: (continuing) It can't be . . . It can't be . . . 
As ANAKIN surveys the carnage, a DARK-ROBED SITH LORD enters. ANAKIN turns to DARTH SIDIOUS and kneels before him. 
ANAKIN: The traitors have been taken care of, Lord Sidious. 
DARTH SlDIOUS: Good . . . good . . . You have done well, my new apprentice. Do you feel your power growing? 
ANAKIN: Yes, My Master. 
DARTH SlDIOUS: Now, Lord Vader, now go and bring peace to the Empire. 
OBI-WAN watches in horror. Tears well up in his eyes. 
OBI-WAN: I can't watch any more. 
OBI-WAN switches off the hologram. The TWO JEDI stand in silence for a few moments. 
YODA: Destroy the Sith, we must. 
OBI-WAN: Send me to kill the Emperor. I will not kill Anakin. 
YODA: To fight this Lord Sidious, strong enough, you are not. 
OBI-WAN: He is like my brother ... I cannot do it. 
YODA: Twisted by the dark side, young Skywalker has become. The boy you trained, gone he is . . . Consumed by Darth Vader. 
OBI-WAN: How could it have come to this? 
YODA: To question, no time there is. 
OBI-WAN: I do not know where the Emperor has sent him. I don't know where to look. 
YODA: Use your feelings, Obi-Wan, and find him, you will. Visit the new Emperor, my task is. May the Force be with you. 
OBI-WAN: May the Force be with you, Master Yoda. 
CAPTAIN TYPHO: As you wish, My Lady . . . but I strongly disagree. 
PADME: I'll be all right, Captain. 
He goes to the speeder and gets in. 
PADME: (continuing) This is something I must do myself. Besides, Threepio will look after me. 
C-3PO: Oh, dear. 
TYPHO takes off and PADME and THREEPIO board the small NABOO SKIFF. A shadow moves out from under the SKIFF. It is OBI-WAN. He quickly jumps on the retracting ramp as the SKIFF takes off. 
192 INT. NABOO SKIFF 
THREEPIO chatters away as PADME breaks down in tears, the painful reality sinking in. 
C-3PO: Green light. Do you know that I think I'm beginning to get the hang of this flying business. 
OBI-WAN stows away on Padme's ship. The ship lifts from the landing platform and heads into the traffic lanes. 
193 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE ARENA-CHANCELLOR'S HOLDING OFFICE-SUNSET 
A HOLOGRAM OF ANAKIN appears before PALPATINE in his office at the bottom of the Senate Arena. 
DARTH VADER: The Separatists are taken care of, My Master. 
DARTH SlDIOUS: It is finished, then. You have restored peace and justice to the galaxy. You have done well, Lord Vader. 
DARTH VADER: Thank you, My Master. 
194 INT. MUSTAFAR-COXFERENCE ROOM-DAY 
A Hologram of Sidious speaks with Anakin in the Mustafar control room. 
DARTH SlDIOUS: Send a message to the ships of the Trade Federation. Tell them the Separatist leaders have been wiped out. Grievous and Dooku have been destroyed. All droid units must shut down immediately. 
DARTH VADER: Very good, My Lord. 
ANAKIN sees Padme's ship arriving on the screen and goes out to meet her. 
195 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY 
The sleek NABOO SKIFF lands on the Mustafar landing platform near Anakin's GREEN STARFIGHTER. ANAKIN runs up to the SKIFF as the ramp lowers. PADME runs to him. 
ANAKIN: Padme, I saw your ship . . . 
They embrace. 
PADME: Oh, Anakin! 
ANAKIN: It's all right, you're safe now. What are you doing out here? 
PADME: I was so worried about you. Obi-Wan told me terrible things. 
ANAKIN: What things? 
PADME: He said you have turned to the dark side . . . that you killed younglings. 
ANAKIN: Obi-Wan is trying to turn you against me. 
PADME: He cares about us. 
ANAKIN: Us??! 
PADME: He knows . . . He wants to help you. 
ANAKIN: Is Obi-Wan going to protect you? He can't ... he can't help you. He's not strong enough. 
PADME: Anakin, all I want is your love. 
ANAKIN: Love won't save you, Padme. Only my new powers can do that. 
PADME: At what cost? You are a good person. Don't do this. 
ANAKIN: I won't lose you the way I lost my mother! I've become more powerful than any Jedi has ever dreamed of and I've done it for you. To protect you. 
PADME: Come away with me. Help me raise our child. Leave everything else behind while we still can. 
ANAKIN: Don't you see, we don't have to run away anymore. I have brought peace to the Republic. I am more powerful than the Chancellor. I can overthrow him, and together you and I can rule the galaxy. Make things the way we want them to be. 
PADME: I don't believe what I'm hearing . . . Obi-Wan was right. You've changed. 
ANAKIN: I don't want to hear any more about Obi-Wan. The Jedi turned against me. Don't you turn against me. 
PADME: I don't know you anymore. Anakin, you're breaking my heart. I'll never stop loving you, but you are going down a path I can't follow. 
ANAKIN: Because of Obi-Wan? 
PADME: Because of what you've done . . . what you plan to do. Stop, stop now. Come back! I love you. 
ANAKIN: (seeing Obi-Wan) Liar! 
PADME turns around and. sees OBI-WAN standing in the doorway of the Naboo Cruiser. 
PADME: No! 
ANAKIN: You're with him. You've betrayed me! You brought him here to kill me! 
PADME: NO! Anakin. I swear ... I ... 
View screens EXPLODE around ANAKIN and OBI-WAN as they work their way into the Control Room. The fighting is intense. OBI-WAN is on the defensive as he jumps up on the table view screen in the center of the room. 
ANAKIN: Don't make me destroy you, Master. You're no match for the dark side. 
OBI-WAN: I've heard that before, Anakin . . . but I never thought I'd hear it from you. 
ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN back into the Conference Room where the quarters are much closer. Sparks fly everywhere. ANAKIN jumps onto the conference table. OBI-WAN slides across the table, knocking ANAKIN over. OBI-WAN grabs ANAKINs lightsaber as he falls. OBI-WAN uses the Force to summon his dropped lightsaber. ANAKIN does the same. 
201 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT 
PALPATINE seeks refuge in the vast Senate Chamber. He gets into the Chancellor's Podium and it starts to rise up into the Arena. YODA makes a giant leap into the control pod. The sword fighting is intense in the confined space. 
202 INT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER-DAY 
The battle intensifies. 
OBI-WAN: (continuing) The flaw of power is arrogance. 
OBI-WAN stands looking at his former apprentice for a moment. 
ANAKIN: You hesitate . . . the flaw of compassion. 
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN lock sabers. OBI-WAN puts out his hand to use the Force to push ANAKIN away. ANAKIN puts out his hand to block OBI-WAN. Both combatants are blasted backwards onto the control panels. They regain their footing and the battle continues. ANAKIN kicks OBI-WAN away. They battle around the room, and eventually the door to the exterior is knocked open. They continue battling out onto the balcony. 
203 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMRER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT 
YODA unleashes a ferocious assault on PALPATINE, causing him to almost go over the edge. The Dark Lord drops his lightsaber but recovers with a BLAST OF ENERGY from his hands that surrounds YODA. YODA is deflecting the Sith Lord's lightning bolts. 
The energy bolts begin to arc back on the Emperor. It looks as if the Dark Lord is doomed. 
YODA: Destroy you I will, just as Master Kenobi, your apprentice will destroy. 
YODA jumps to a lower Senate Pod. PALPATINE reaches out with one hand, and a Senate pod is released from its mooring and heads toward the Podium. PALPATINE uses the Force to hurl pod after pod at YODA, who ducks and jumps from one flying pod to another. 
YODA leaps away from the pods. He uses the Force to hold one pod suspended in the air. The pod spins and YODA throws it back at PALPATINE, who leaps away at the last moment. 
YODA leaps after him, but PALPATINE quickly turns and aims the full force of his energy bolts at the tiny green Jedi, catching him in mid-air and throwing him back hard against the Podium. The force causes YODA to drop his lightsaber. YODA blocks the lightning and throws PALPATINE backwards off the podium. YODA is knocked off the Podium and falls several hundred feet to the base of the Podium. PALPATINE follows in his pod, searching for YODA. 
204 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY-DAY 
ANAKIN forces OBI-WAN down a narrow balcony outside the Control Room. He rips objects off the wall and throws them at OBI-WAN as he pushes him further and further along the walkway. 
The balcony ends, and OBI-WAN is trapped. He looks over the balcony and into a river of lava. 
ANAKIN cuts apiece of the balcony railing off, along with a control panel. ALARMS SOUND, and a protective ray shield around the superstructure disappears. It tumbles into the molten abyss, disappearing in a puff of smoke. A small pipe connects the Control Center to the Main Collection Plant. OBI-WAN has no choice but to tightrope-walk out across the lava river while fighting ANAKIN. 
205 EXT. MUSTAFAR-MAIN CONTROL CENTER BALCONY, PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER, MAIN COLLECTION PLANT-DAY 
ANAKIN, following OBI-WAN, jumps down onto the flexing pipe, lands, and resumes fighting. 
206 INT. MUSTAFAR-PIPE ACROSS LAVA RIVER-DAY 
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN work their way across the small pipe, fighting ferociously as they go. OBI-WAN slips, throws his lightsaber up in the air, grabs on to the pipe, swings around, grabs on to an upper pipe, retrieves his lightsaber, and lands back on the original pipe. They continue to fight across the pipe until they reach the Main Collection Plant. 
207 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-WIRING CHUTE-NIGHT 
YODA squishes his way through a mass of wires in a small chute. He talks on his comlink. 
YODA: Hurry. Careful timing we will need. 
BAIL ORGANA: (in speeder) There aren't many troops on this side. Activate your homing beacon when you're ready. 
208 INT. CORUSCANT-SENATE CHAMBER-MAIN ARENA-NIGHT 
A Senate pod with COMMANDER THIRE (4477) and SEVERAL OTHER CLONE TROOPERS climb up to where MAS AMEDDA and PALPATINE are waiting. Beneath the Main Podium, TWENTY CLONE TROOPERS search for Yoda 's body. 
CLONE COMMANDER THIRE: There is no sign of his body, sir. 
MAS AMEDDA: Then he is not dead. 
PALPATINE: Double your search. 
CLONE COMMANDER THIRE: Yes sir. Right away, sir. 
PALPATINE: (to Mas Amedda) Tell Captain Kagi to prepare my shuttle for immediate takeoff. 
MAS AMEDDA: Yes, Master. 
PALPATINE: I sense Lord Vader is in danger. 
PALPATINE walks into the Arena hallway. COMMANDER THIRE descends down to the floor of the Arena, where an intense search is taking place. SEVERAL CURIOUS SENATORS rubberneck in scattered pods. 
209 EXT. MUSTAFAR-COLLECTION PANELS-DAY 
OBI-WAN and ANAKIN battle on the top of the multispired collection panels, jumping from one to the other. At the end of the collection cluster, a huge spray of lava covers the attachments that hold up the collectors. The frame begins to melt. It's raining lava. Both ANAKIN and OBI-WAN run for cover under the collection cluster. They continue to fight in the lava rain, darting from cover to attack, then quickly retreating to cover. Support for the entire structure begins to fall away, and the collection cluster falls into the lava river. The Jedi continue their fight, climbing to the highest point on the tower as the rest begins to melt away as it rides the swift current down the river. 
It bends toward the lava as they get out toward the end. The fighting gets fierce. OBI-WAN gets to the end and is trapped. The tower slowly starts to sink under the lava. 
210 EXT. CORUSCANT-SENATE OFFICE BUILDING-NIGHT 
BAIL ORGANA, in his open Cockpit Speeder, flies along next to the roof eave of the huge Senate Building. He slows and moves closer to a long row of recessed lights. Suddenly YODA falls out of one of the light recesses and lands in the Speeder. BAIL guns it and heads away from the Senate Building. 
211 INT. CORUSCANT-BAIL ORGANA'S SPEEDER-NIGHT 
YODA straightens himself out. 
YODA: Into exile I must go. Failed, I have. 
YODA and BAIL fly into the traffic of the city. 
DARTH SIDIOUS: Anakin! Anakin! There he is. He's still alive. Get a medical capsule, immediately. 
CLONE CAPTAIN: Yes sir. Right away. 
Several of the CLONES rush off as DARTH SIDlOUS puts his hand on ANAKIN's forehead. 
222 INT. POLIS MASSA-OBSERVATION DOME-NIGHT 
On the isolated asteroid of Polis Massa, YODA meditates. 
YODA: Failed to stop the Sith Lord, I have. Still much to learn, there is ... 
QUI -GON: (V.O.) Patience. You will have time. I did not. When I became one with the Force I made a great discovery. With my training, you will be able to merge with the Force at will. Your physical self will fade away, but you will still retain your consciousness. You will become more powerful than any Sith. 
YODA: Eternal consciousness. 
QUI-GON: (V.O.) The ability to defy oblivion can be achieved, but only for oneself. It was accomplished by a Shaman of the Whills. It is a state acquired through compassion, not greed. 
YODA: . . . to become one with the Force, and influence still have . . . A power greater than all, it is. 
QUI-GON: (V.O.) You will learn to let go of everything. No attachment, no thought of self. No physical self. 
YODA: A great Jedi Master, you have become, Qui-Gon Jinn. Your apprentice I gratefully become. 
YODA thinks about this for a minute, then BAIL ORGANA enters the room and breaks his meditation. 
BAIL ORGANA: Excuse me, Master Yoda. Obi-Wan Kenobi has made contact. 
223 EXT. MUSTAFAR-LANDING PLATFORM-DAY 
The CLONES have placed ANAKIN in a medical capsule. They float the wounded Sith Lord into the belly of the IMPERIAL CRUISER. DARTH SIDIOUS follows the capsule into the ship. The ship takes off.

OBI-WAN lands the Naboo Cruiser on the landing platform of the isolated post of Polis Massa. YODA and BAIL ORGANA, along with a FEW GROUND CREW, are waiting as the ramp lowers and OBI-WAN emerges, carrying the unconscious PADME in his arms, followed by ARTOO and THREEPIO. 
BAIL ORGANA: We'll take her to the medical center, quickly. 
225 EXT. LANDING PLATFORM-CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY 
The shuttle lands. DARTH SIDIOUS and CLONE TROOPERS leave the shuttle. ANAKIN's body is carried along in a floating medical capsule. 
226 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT 
POLIS MEDICS work, on PADME in an operating theater. OBI-WAN and one of the MEDICAL DROIDS enter an observation room where BAIL and YODA are waiting. 
MEDICAL DROID: Medically, she is completely healthy. For reasons we can't explain, we are losing her. 
OBI-WAN: She's dying? 
MEDICAL DROID: We don't know why. She has lost the will to live. We need to operate quickly if we are to save the babies. 
BAIL ORGANA: Babies??!! 
MEDICAL DROID: She's carrying twins. 
YODA: Save them, we must. They are our last hope. 
The MEDICAL DROID rushes back to the operating room. ARTOO and THREEPIO watch, greatly puzzled. ARTOO BEEPS. 
C-3PO: It s some kind of reproductive process, I think. 
227 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY 
ANAKIN, in the medical capsule, is lifted onto a table in the Rehab Center. DROIDS go to work on him. ANAKIN has new legs and a new arm. 
228 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT 
The TWINS are being delivered as BAIL ORGANA, YODA, ARTOO, and THREEPIO watch. OBI-WAN is in the operating theater with PADME. He takes her hand. 
OBI-WAN: Don't give up, Padme. 
PADME winces from the pain. The MEDICAL DROID is holding the BABY. 
MEDICAL DROID: It's a boy. 
PADME: Luke . . . 
PADME can only offer up a faint smile. She struggles to touch the baby on the forehead. 
MEDICAL DROID: ... and a girl. 
PADME: . . . Leia. 
R2-D2, THREEPIO and BAIL ORGANA watch from an adjoining space. 
229 INT. CORUSCANT-IMPERIAL REHAB CENTER-DAY 
VADER, dressed in his black body armor, lies on the table. Nose plugs are inserted and the mask drops from above, sealing tightly. The helmet is fitted and VADER begins breathing. 
230 INT. POLIS MASSA-MEDICAL CENTER-NIGHT 
OBI WAN leans over PADME and softly speaks to her. 
OBI-WAN: You have twins, Padme They need you . . . hang on. 
PADME: I can't . . . 
PADME winces again and takes OBI-WAN's hand. She is holding Anakin's japor snippet.

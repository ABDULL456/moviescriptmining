MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS: THE MOVIE REVISIONS BY ARNE OLSEN DIRECTED BY BRYAN SPICER REVISED DRAFT OCTOBER 31 1994 
FADE IN: 
BLACK SCREEN 
Words SCRAWL UP ON SCREEN and we hear a RESOUNDING VOICE. 
VOICE In a time of great strife, a legendary interdimensional being known as Zordon, came to the city of Angel Grove to establish a vanguard in the never ending struggle against evil.  with the aid of his trusted assistant, Alpha 5, the noble master sought out six extraordinary teenagers and gave them the power to transform into an unstoppable fighting force.  In time of great need, the young heroes could now call upon colossal assault vehicles known as "Zords".  while the identity of the six remained a guarded secret, their courageous exploits soon became the stuff of Legend, earning them the title...  The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. 
We hear PUMPING ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC as the POWER RANGER'S LOGO BURST'S ONTO THE SCREEN.  Now the logo EXPLODES, revealing 
1   EXT.  PROP PLANE / FLYING - DAY                             1 
A prop plane whisking across the deep blue sky. 
ROCKY YeeeoowwWWWWW!!! 
2   INT.  PROP PLANE / FLYING - DAY                             2 
The six Power Rangers, TOMMY, KIMBERLY, BILLY, AISHA, ADAM and ROCKY sport sleek sky diving suits, parachute packs and helmets.  Tommy is strapped into a high-tech airboard. 
ROCKY We're OUTTA here!! 
KIMBERLY Easy, Rock. 
TOMMY Once we hit the target zone we've got fifteen seconds to make the drop. 
BULK  (0 . S .) Step aside, pinheads. 
BULK and SKULL push their way through the Rangers, decked in bizarre skydiving regalia, topped off by World War II leather caps and aviator goggles. 
BULK The Stealth Eagle is about to fly. 
SKULL Ditto for the Swooping Swallow. 
The Rangers exchange amused looks.  Aisha gestures to them 
AISHA Lead on, flyboys. 
Bulk and Skull swagger to the door and open it - the ground is a dizzying distance below.  They swallow hard. 
SKULL Bulk... where'd the earth go? 
BILLY Five seconds to the target zone! 
TOMMY Aisha  you' re  on ! 
Bulk and Skull step aside, Aisha LAUNCHES herself. 
The others follow through the opening with flair. 
ROCKY Stylin! 
ADAM On your tail! 
BILLY All systems 
Tommy and Kimberly share an infectious glance, Kimberly a hand, indicating Tommy should go first. 
TOMMY Surf's up! 
He's gone.  Kimberly stands backwards in the doorway. 
KIMBERLY Catch you on the flipside. 
Bulk and Skull watch wide-eyed as she BACK-FLIPS out of the plane. 
3   EXT. SKY  -  DAY 
ROCK AND ROLL fills the track as the Rangers plunge towards earth, executing a series of MIND-BOGGLING MANEUVERS: SPINS, FISHTAILS, POWER DIVES, BACK FLIPS, you name it. 
4   INT. PROP PLANE  -  DAY                          4 
Bulk and Skull psyche themselves up. 
BULK Be the eagle.  Be the eagle. 
ROCKY You read my mind. 
KIMBERLY Last one to Ernies buys. 
ADAM Let's roll! 
8   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK  -  DAY                              8 
We hear a VOCIFEROUS SISSING SOUND, but we can't see where  it's coming from. - Suddenly the six Rangers come SCREAMING AROUND A CORNER ON STATE-OF-THE-ART ROLLERBLADES.  These kids are FLYING!! 
We hear FULL-THROTTLED MUSIC as the kids WEAVE, DUCK and SWERVE like blading virtuosos.  Tommy LEAPS in the air, does a 180 and SKATES BACKWARD. 
THE HIGH BRANCHES.past a large tree as Bulk and Skull DROP INTO FRAME 
SKULL Stealth Eagle, huh?  The Lame Duck is more like it! 
9   EXT.  CITY STREET - DAY                                     9 
The Rangers GLIDE around another corner -- there's buildings on one side of them and a construction site on the other. 
TOMMY Let's take the shortcut! 
Tommy leads them up a plywood ramp -- they LAUNCH TEN FEET THROUGH THE AIR, PULLING OFF HAIR-RAISING FREE STYLE MOVES THEN MAKE SPECTACULAR LANDINGS on the construction site parking structure. 
As they shoot across the concrete, the CAMERA PUSHES IN on: 
10   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTtZUCTION SITE - DAY                   10 
... WORKERS operating heavy machinery -- cranes, bulldozer , etc., Construction Worker  jackhammers solid rock.  Drill makes a CLANGING SOUND as it HITS METAL!  A baffled look comes over him as he stops the jackhammer, brushes away debris.. uncovering an ANCIENT IRON PLATE.  He gapes at it, too stunned to speak. 
11   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER                  11 
A large hook has been fastened to the iron plate -- a crane ENGINE ROARS as it HOISTS THE PLATE UP, revealing a CAVERNOUS OPENING. 
TWO MORE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS have joined the first, all of them look on in amazement. 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER #2 Whadda you figure it is?! 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER #1 Hey, ya got me. 
Suddenly a PURPLE STEAM POURS from the opening.  And now something really amazing happens.   .. 
A menacing STONE CLAW RISES UP, CRADLING A HUGE STONE 
CONSTRUCTION  WORKER  # 1 ... I'll be damned. 
As though drawn by it's power, he moves to touch it. 
KZAAAAAAP?!!  APURPLE BEAM OF LIGHT BLASTS HIM -- SENDS HIM FLYING TEN FEET THROUGH THE AIR! 
CONSTRUCTION WORKER #1 AHHHHHHHHH! 
11A   EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY                                11A 
A T.V.  REPORTER is talking into camera. 
REPORTER We're here at the World Center Construction Site, where a mysterious object was just uncovered in a freak accident in which one workman suffered minor injuries... 
thru    OMITTED 
13A  INT.  ERNIE'S WATERFRONT CAFE - DAY                           13A 
CLOSE ON - T.V.  SCREEN 
We see the reporter then a few cuts of GEOLOGISTS combing the site with scanning equipment and COPS sealing off the area with yellow tape. 
REPORTER ... Angel Grove Police have cordoned off the area until it can be determined whether or not the unidentified object poses any threat.  The injured workman was quoted as saying... 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL A CAFE. 
The Rangers are at a table -- Tommy is teaching Fred martial arts moves. 
TOMMY It's one smooth move and then you've gotta explode off the top. 
Tommy executes a wicked JUMPING ROUNDHOUSE KICK.  Fred is wowed.  He drops into position. 
TOMMY Nice and easy. 
ALPHA 5 To assist you I have retro-fitted your helmets with new Opti-Scan devices. 
ZORDON Use extreme caution, Rangers. You are dealing with an evil here that is beyond ALL comprehension. 
16   EXT.  INNER CITY CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT 
Barricades and police tape surround the egg.  A  SECURITY GUARD passes his sleeping CO-WORKER, drops into a chair, sips his coffee. 
BZZWAPP -- ZEDD, RITA, GOLDAR and a short, fat, furry creature named MORDANT appear. 
RITA Another Saturday night and I'm traipsing around the galaxy with the THREE LITTLE PIGS!  My mother warned me this would happen! Rita, she said, after 89 marriages you might wanna think about throwing in the towel.  Why didn't I listen to her?! 
Zedd grumbles to himself. 
ZEDD That's a good question. 
The stunned guard stirs his sleeping buddy. 
FIRST SECURITY GUARD Uh... Kurt...  you might wanna take a look at this. 
Kurt looks up groggily. 
ZEDD No need to wake him.  In fact, why don't you take a little nap yourself. 
Zedd ZAPS THE GUYS with a bolt from his staff -- they are knocked out. 
Goldar steps back from the blast and accidentally steps or Mordant's foot.  Mordant KNOCKS on Goldar's metallic leg. 
MORDANT Hey bonehead, get off my hoof! 
Goldar is oblivious.  Zedd, stands reverently before the glowing egg shape. 
ZEDD After two thousand years of searching...  I have finally found you. 
Mordant BANGS on Goldar's leg again. 
MORDANT Yo, earth to Bigfoot! 
Goldar SWATS Mordant. 
GOLDAR Watch your mouth, fuzz-ball! 
ZEDD SILENCE! 
RITA (to  Goldar) Where did you FIND this rabid little rodent, anyway?! 
GOLDAR Mordant's my second cousin three times removed on my mother's side.  He`s just visiting for the summer. 
RITA Well put a muzzle on him! 
Mordant GRUMBLES under his breath.  Meanwhile, Zedd aims  is staff at the chamber and BURSTS a blast of energy.  The egg opens up with a wHOOSH of decompressing air.  webs of ELECTRICITY BRANCH OUT, followed by a SWIRL OF BLACK SMOKE. 
When the smoke clears we see a BUBBLING, PURPLE, PHOSPHOSCENT OOZE.  The group gathers around -- Rita sticks a finger in  o the sticky substance. 
RITA What... you spent two thousand years looking for this tub of SNOT! 
As if in response, the ooze BOILS AND FROTHS.  Zedd and Rita are too busy arguing to notice this. 
ZEDD Don't you ever have anything nice to say?! 
RITA Well, if I did I certainly wouldn't say it to you! 
We hear a SLITHERING SLURPING SOUND as the substance RISES UP AND TAKES ON THE GHASTLY SHAPE OF IVAN OOZE.  Mordant tugs at Zedd. 
MORDANT Boss. 
ZEDD For your information this is not just your average, run-of-the- mill tub of snot ! 
RITA You're trying to tell me there`re different levels of snot?! 
MORDANT Boss. 
ZEDD WHAT! 
Zedd and Rita finally notice Ivan, standing with his lips apart, revealing jagged teeth, one of which is made of GLISTENING SILVER. 
He stretches his sinewy arms, releases an enormous YAWN, puts his hands on his head, CRACKS it. 
SECURITY GUARD You had me scared there. 
AISHA Makes two of us. 
KIMBERLY You haven't by any chance seen a ... morphological being lurking around? 
SECURITY GUARD The only thing I've seen is you teenagers. (beat) And you know... if there's one thing in the world I reeeeally hate.... 
CLOSE ON HIS FACE as it SHAPE-SHIFTS INTO THE+ HIDEOUS VISAGE OF IVAN OOZE. 
IVAN It's TEENAGERS 
KIMBERLY GroSS! 
IVAN You're too kind.  Allow me to introduce myself.  I am the infamous, world-reviled, universally despised, IVAN OOZE! 
ROCKY Well, pack your bags cause we're sending you back where you came from! 
IVAN Gee, a teenager with a big mouth. Not much has changed in six thousand years. 
KIMBERLY we're not just teenagers, raisin- head. 
TOMMY We're the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers! 
Ivan puts his hands to his face in mock fear. 
IVAN Ooooh, where's my autoqraph book?. 
He looks them over reproachfully. 
IVAN Power Rangers, huh?  So Zordon is still using a bunch of rug-rats to do his dirty work.  And speaking of rats... 
Ivan raises both hands -- ELECTRICITY SHOOTS OUT HIS FINGERS and the kids DIVE CLEAR as the bolt ZAPS A THRONG OF RATS. 
Now, incredibly, the RATS GROWN INTO GRUNTING, SNARLING MAN SIZED RAT-BEASTS. 
IVAN From this moment forth, the world as you know it SHALL CEASE TO EXIST! 
Ivan raises his arms -- thunder CRACKLES and LIGHTNING RIPS ACROSS THE SKY. 
IVAN WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE! 
An EXPLOSION OF PURPLE SMOKE CONSUMES IVAN. 
ROCKY He's  gone. 
The RATS ATTACK! 
ADAM Let's take these beasts!! 
Tommy gets off a stellar CROSS-HOCK TAKEDOWN, Kimberly delivers a world class HEEL STOMP, Billy executes a lethal REVERSE HANDSWORD.  Despite their valiant efforts, the Rangers ar being overwhelmed by the fierce combatants. 
19   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT 
SMOKE POURS from various circuit boards, numerous control panels VIBRATE. 
ZORDON Alpha, my sensors tell me the Rangers were too late!  Ivan is on his way here! 
ALPHA 5 Hey, NOBODY enters the Command Center without a power coin! 
There's a BLEET, BLEET -- emergency lights start FLASHING near the entrance.  Alpha watches, forlorn, as OOZE SEEPS through the hairline cracks in the door. 
ALPHA 5 Well...  ALMOST nobody. 
The ooze SLITHERS AND GURGLES ACROSS THE FLOOR, once again IVAN RISES UP.  He takes in the state-of-the-art surroundings. 
IVAN Gee... pretty fancy-shmancy.  I guess if you invest your money well over SIXTY centuries you can buy something pretty nice. 
Alpha drops into a Karate stance, makes some BRUCE LEE NOISES then LUNGES. 
ALPHA 5 HI ,  YAH ! 
Ivan holds his arm out, ZAPS Alpha with an electrical charge Alpha starts spinning. 
ALPHA  5 Welcome to Wiener World.  May I take your order, please? 
ZORDON You haven't changed, Ooze. You're still picking on creatures smaller than yourself. 
AISHA SABER TOOTH TIGER! 
TOMMY WHITE TIGER! 
RANGERS MORPHENOMENAL! 
They JUMP INTO THE AIR and they're ENGULFED IN A DAZZLING GOLDEN LIGHT as we do a 3D MOVIE VERSION OF THEIR TRANSFORMATION INTO COSTUME. 
They all LAND and there's a WHIRRING SOUND as all six of the face pieces POLARIZE so we can see their faces.  The rats immediately scurry off. 
TOMMY Let's teach these vermin a few manners. 
AISHA Activating Power Beam! 
A YELLOW BEAM SLICES THROUGH THE DARKNESS.  Aisha leads the group through the site. 
KIMBERLY Everybody stay alert.

They pass a bulldozer, some scaffolding 
ADAM Hold it... 
They come to a stop. 
ADAM (pointing) I heard something over there. 
BILLY Activating Audio Enhancer! 
AN AUTO-PHONIC RECEIVER POPS OUT of the side of Billy's helmet.  As he turns his head, the receivers ROTATE. 
SOUND EFFECT:  We hear silence and then... a RASPY BREATHING, followed by a GUTTURAL SNARL. 
BILLY They're on the other side of that wall. 
The Rangers advance along a cement wall, slowly round a corner.  Aisha's light PANS THROUGH THE GLOOM. 
TOMMY Anybody see them? 
ROCKY Activating Power Scope! 
A SCOPE SNAPS into place over Rocky's left eye. 
P.O.V.  - THROUGH POWER TRACKER 
We see HEAT SENSOR OUTLINES, PULSATING WITH COLOR.  COMMAND GRAPHIC:  SEARCH MODE. 
Lines VECTOR and SCAN as Rocky searches the area.  Eventually he looks up and the lines LOCK ON TO THE PULSATING FORMS  OF THE RATS. 
ROCKY THEY'RE ABOVE US!! 
The creatures LEAP DOWN and we see the Rangers pull off KICKS, SUCKER PUNCHES, SPINBACK-ROUNDHOUSES, you name it. 
One of the beasts TACKLES Tommy and the pair go TUMBLING OWN A TWENTY FOOT ROCK PILE.  Aisha picks up a handful of dirt 
AISHA Hey, handsome! 
A beast turns -- Aisha FLINGS dirt in his eyes. 
AISHA My mistake. 
She follows through with an OVER SHOULDER THROW -- the beast CRASHES INTO A JOHNNY-ON-THE-SPOT. 
Rocky fights another beast and the creature SWINGS UP THROUGH SCAFFOLDING with phenomenal dexterity.  Rocky goes after him. 
TOMMY SABA SABER? 
The talking Saber appears in Tommy's hand. 
SABA (yawning) What a DREAM I was having! 
TOMMY We've got company. 
Saba sees the rats. 
Adam spots Alpha's arm protruding from a mound of rubble. 
ADAM Guys! 
The kids quickly uncover the battered robot. 
BILLY Alpha, are you okay?! 
ALPHA 5 I'll GET you my pretty, and your little DOG toa!! 
BILLY He must've blown an anitromic demodulator! 
KIMBERLY (stunned) Oh, no... 
Everybody follows Kimberly's gaze, thunderstruck expressions coming over them. 
Laying on a destroyed bed of crystals is Zordon.  He is still a SHIMMERING SPECTRAL being, only now he s aged a good fifty years. 
The kids stand over him, forlorn. 
AISHA ... What's happening to him?' 
BILLY Outside of his time warp he's aging at a vastly acellerated rate! 
KIMBERLY We have to help him! 
Zordon opens his eyes. 
ZORDON ...  Rangers... thank goodness you're safe. 
The kids drop down beside him. 
TOMMY We have to get you back inside your time warp. 
ZORDON I'm afraid that's impossible... The power has been destroyed. It's gone... The Zords, the weapons...  all of it. (beat) The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers are no more. 
The kids are stunned.  Kimberly gently takes Zordon's hand. 
KIMBERLY Zordon... you can't leave us. Ever since you came into our lives... you've been like another father `to  us  all.- 
ZORDON ... You must be strong... Ivan almost overthrew the planet once...  and now I'm afraid he has the strength to see his scheme through. 
Zordon closes his eyes.  Tommy puts a hand on Kimberly's shoulder.  The kids slowly rise, all of them looking utterly despondent.  Billy turns to Alpha. 
BILLY what're we going to do? 
ALPHA 5 I do not LIKE Green Eggs and Ham! I do not like them, Sam-I-am! 
Billy opens a panel on Alpha's back, makes an adjustment. Alpha's head rolls back like he's going to sneeze. 
ALPHA 5 Ah-Ah-Ahhhh-CHOO!! 
SPARKS BURST from where his nose should be.  He SNIFFS. 
ALPHA 5 Thanks, Billy. 
Rocky hands Alpha a hanky, Alpha wipes his nose area. 
ADAM There has to be something we can do. 
TOMMY Come on, guys, think! 
Aisha turns to Alpha. 
AISHA Alpha.  Is there any way we can defeat this  monster?  Any way at all? 
ALPHA 5 ... Perhaps there is a way... I have heard tales of another power. 
ADAM What?! 
ALPHA 5 ... They say that somewhere beyond the Hyperion Constellation there exists a mythological power that is beyond all comprehension. 
TOMMY How can we get to it? 
ALPHA 5 As the legend goes, the power is impossible to obtain. 
ROCKY We have to try, Alpha.  It's our only hope. 
RITA Rrgh mmffpprr brghuh!! 
ZEDD How dare you?!  Nobody shuts up Rita but me! 
IVAN Sorry, slick, there's been a slight'change of plans. (arms out in trademark stance) The "booger man" is taking over. 
Ivan drops regally into Zedd's chair. 
ZEDD Nobody double-crosses Lord Zedd and lives! 
Mordant slips behind Goldar, using him as a shield. 
MORDANT Zedd's gonna kick this snotball into next week! 
Zedd SHOOTS A BLAST from his staff -- Ivan is COVERED IN SPARKS. 
IVAN Ooooh, that tickles! 
Ivan raises his hands and the sparks DISAPPEAR. 
IVAN My turn. 
He ZAPS Rita and Zedd, and with a BRILLIANT FLASH, THEY'RE GONE. 
Mordant moves to a snow-globe on the table, his mouth falling open.  Zedd and Rita are INSIDE IT!! 
Rita wipes the ooze off her mouth, RANTS IN A MUNCHKIN VOICE. 
RITA This is all your fault!  If you'd taken me out tonight like you were suposed to, none of this would've happened. 
Ivan turns menacingly to Goldar and Mordant. 
IVAN Now you have a choice, either serve me, or join those insufferable cheesedongs. 
Mordant and Goldar exchange a look, then turn back to Ivan. 
GOLDAR We never liked the cheesedongs in the first place. 
MORDANT Couldn''t stand them -- low-class all the way.  And did you catch a whiff of their BREATH?!  It's like having a conversation with a couple of ONIONS!  Not to mention... 
Goldar throws a hand over Mordant's mouth, MUFFLING him. 
GOLDAR (apologetic) He's just visiting for the summer. (beat) Now what about,the Rangers, oh hideous one? 
IVAN Ah yes, the RANGERS!!! 
He makes a HOARKING SOUND then SPITS OOZE ONTO THE FLOOR, 
MORDANT Gasunteidt. 
Now the OOZE GROWS INTO TEN TENGU WARRIORS -- BIRD-LIKE CREATURES WITH LONG BEAKS AND ENORMOUS WINGS. 
THEY GOBBLE, SQUAWK AND CHIRP like newborn chickens, the CACOPHONY GROWING LOUDER AND LOUDER until... 
IVAN SHUT YOUR BEAKS !! 
The Tengu fall dead silent. 
IVAN Tengu Warriors, you will fly to Phaedos, find the Power Rangers...  and TEAR THEM APART! 
The creatures make HORRENDOUS SQUAWKING SOUNDS AS THEY SPREAD THEIR REPTILIAN WINGS. 
IVAN Mordant, go with them and report back to me! 
MORDANT You know boss, I'd really like to help out but I've got this gastronomic condition which rules out all space trave-- 
One of the Tengu grabs hold of Mordant and the FLOCK WINGS OFF LIKE COLOSSAL BATS. 
MORDANT IIIIIII!!! 
ANGLE ON - SNOW GLOBE 
Zedd waves his arms around in outrage. 
ZEDD Isn't this just TYPICAL!  We finally do somebody a good turn and just look what happens! 
RITA From now on it's E-V-I-L, NO exceptions! 
IVAN Taking over the world is one thing.  It's finding good help to run it for you that's the killer. 
GOLDAR You want me to place a few calls? 
Ivan shakes his head. 
IVAN No need.   I'm going to use the young minds of Angel Grove. 
GOLDAR digs for buried treasure deep in his nose. 
GOLDAR No offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting. 
IVAN Yes, well, I suppose you'd know a little something about that. (beat) Not to worry.  I'll ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils!  And what better way to entice them ... than with a little Ivan's Ooze?! 
Ivan approaches an enormous vat, turns a tap -- it BURPS and GLOPS as PURPLE OOZE pours out. 
GOLDAR But boss, what about their parents? 
IVAN Ah, the old and doddering.  I'm going to SCOURGE their puny minds, reducing them to ZOMBIE'S. And then I'll put them to work rebuilding my empire. 
Bulk and Skull enter waving a "help wanted" flier.  Both them are wearing their garish blazers and dark sunglasses. 
SKULL I understand you're looking for a few new assistants. 
Bulk does a G.Q. stance. 
BULK Well put your mind to rest `cause now you've got the best. 
Ivan doesn't look too pleased. 
IVAN What is this?!  I advertised for brilliant and good looking assistants! 
Skull extends his hand. 
SKULL Hi, I'm brilliant. 
BULK (hand extended) And I'm good looking. 
Ivan steps forward. 
IVAN And I'm Little-Bo-Peep. 
Bulk and Skull lower the sunglasses and take a good look Ivan.  Both of them swallow hard. 
SKULL Bulk... why don't we give Mr. Peep here a chance to think it over? 
BULK A stellar idea, Skull. 
They start to back away. 
IVAN Not so fast, greaseballs. 
Goldar blocks their way. 
IVAN You'll have to do. 
34   thru   38   OMITTED 
39   EXT.  PHAEDOS JUNGLE - DAY                          39 
The Rangers move through foreboding jungle terrain, their ears alert to all the UNEARTHLY SOUNDS around them.  Tommy watches Kimberly, who seems to be lost in thought. 
TOMMY Hey. 
Kimberly glances up. 
TOMMY You okay? 
Kimberly takes a moment to answer. 
KIMBERLY I was just thinking about Zordon...  everything we've been through together. 
AISHA You know, meeting Zordon... teaming up with you guys, it's the best thing that's ever happened to me. 
ROCKY It's the best thing that's ever happened to all of us. 
ADAM ... He's gonna make it, guys. 
KIMBERLY The lady asked you a question. 
TOMMY Huh ... Oh, uh, we re, ah... 
Kimberly intervenes. 
KIMBERLY He was attacked by this horrific being -- Ivan Ooze. 
DULCEA Ivan Ooze is free?!  We are all in mortal danger! 
She moves off - the Rangers just stand there staring at each other. 
DULCEA Let' s go. 
The Rangers quickly follow her through the brush Aisha turns to Kimberly, speaks under her breath. 
AISHA Kind of bossy, isn't she? 
39A.. EXT.  ANGEL GROVE PARK - DAY      (OLD SC 38)         39A 
CLOSE UP - OOZE CONTAINER 
There's a label with a picture of Ivan -- he's wearing make-up to make him a little more presentable. 
DOZENS OF KIDS Ranging in age from eight to seventeen, are swarming Bulk and Skull, who have set up a booth with a large banner that reads:      "FREE OOZE!" 
Some kids STRETCH the ooze, others MOLD it, others THROW it at each other.  It's an ooze free-for-all. 
IVAN Boys and girls, girls and boys, gather round and feast your eyes. This ain't sludge and this ain't guck... this is the one and only Ivan's Ooze!  Yesireebob.  It's ooey, gooey and even kind of chewy.  But best of all it's FREE! 
Bulk and Skull run a booth.   A banner screams "OOZE RULES". Kids crowd around. 
BULK Here you go!  No pushing! 
SKULL There's enough for everybody! 
Fred approaches. 
FRED So where'd this guy come from? 
Bulk and Skull exchange apprehensive looks. 
SKULL Uh... that's classified, top secret, confidential, undercover information. 
BULK If we told you -- we'd have to kill you. 
Fred looks at the container in his hand but he doesn't open it. Skull sees a kid HURL some ooze at him. 
SKULL INCOMING! 
Skull ducks and Bulk gets SPLATTERED in the face.  Bulk glares at Skull, wipes some goop off, FLICKS it at Skull. 
WIZARD Come on, come all -- it's an COZE FREE FOR ALL! 
He smiles, revealing a glistening silver tooth. 
40   thru   42   OMITTED 
42A   EXT.  DULCEA'S MOUNTAINSIDE COMPLEX - DAY            42A 
An oriental garden set against a stunning hillside vista. 
43    EXT.  DULCEA'S CAMP / PHAEDOS - DAY                  43 
The kids are seated on rocks by a lakeside, all of them drinking from clay mugs.  Dulcea finishes handing out bowls. Aisha stares into hers with a grim expression. 
AISHA Is this... food! 
DULCEA They're called squirbs. 
Kimberly lifts out an EEL-LIKE CREATURE, and watches it SQUIRM between her fingers. 
KIMBERLY Mine seems to be a little undercooked. 
Dulcea sprinkles hers with brown flakes. 
DULCEA Add a few dried weevils and you'll never know the difference. 
Dulcea and Billy circle one another, fighting with spinning WHISTLING sticks. 
Dulcea is blindfolded, Billy isn't. 
DULCEA The wolf relies on it's enhanced senses to guide it...  He can hear what we cannot hear, he can smell what we cannot smell. 
Billy takes SWING after SWING -- Dulcea easily DEFLECTS every blow. 
Now Dulcea takes numerous SWINGS, THWACKING Billy repeatedly and finally KNOCKING him INTO THE WATER. 
54B   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY                    54B 
Dulcea, Adam and Snoggle stand in an area filled with FLYING INSECTS. 
DULCEA The frog remains still and silent while it assesses its target... then strikes out in the blink of an eye. 
We hear a TRILLING SOUND as Dulcea watches some kind of insect dart around her. 
THWAP!  The TRILLING SOUND is gone.  Dulcea has literally caught the insect in the blink of an eye.  Adam shakes his head in disbelief. 
He waits a moment, hears a TAT-TAT-TAT sound and watches a insect zip around him.  He lashes out numerous times, missing the insect completely. 
THWUMP!  With lightning speed Snoggle VACUUMS the fly into his snout.  CRUNCH, CRUNCH, CRUNCH. 
Adam speaks under his breath. 
ADAM Show off. 
54C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - DAY   (OLD SC 52)    54C 
Aisha watches as Dulcea goes into a bear stance. 
DULCEA The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.  Nothing can uproot it. 
Snoggle CHARGES Dulcea, SLAMS INTO HER.  She remains as rooted as a tree.  Snoggle meanwhile suffers some serious bodily damage. 
AISHA Girl, you've got to be kidding me. 
Snoggle recovers and faces Aisha.  Aisha shrugs, goes into a bear stance.  Snoggle charges, SLAMS INTO HER and sends HER FLYING!

Dulcea and Tommy are standing on a towering rock rising out of a dark lake. 
DULCEA The falcon never struggles with the air, but rather becomes one with it. 
Now Dulcea does the impossible.  She LEAPS OFF THE ROCK, SOARS FIFTY FEET through the air, AND LANDS on another protruding rock.  Tommy is stunned. 
DULCEA (calling out) JOIN WITH THE FORCES OF NATURE! 
Tommy psyches himself up. 
TOMMY You can do this.  You can do this.  You can do this... 
He spreads his arms out, LEAPS... and DROPS LIKE A ROCK exploding into THE BLACK WATER. 
54G   INT.  COMMAND CENTER - NIGHT      (OLD SC 54E)     54G 
Alpha fusses over Zordon, who is looking a good ten years older. 
ZORDON ... Alpha, I am deeply concerned about the Rangers... 
ALPHA 5 I told them it was too dangerous, but they wouldn't listen. 
ZORDON ... We must try to communicate with them. 
Alpha looks out over the decimated Command Center. 
ALPHA 5 Perhaps if I could locate a vertical-deflector then I could assemble a holographic-comlink. 
Zordon shudders in pain, closes his eyes.  Alpha watches over his mentor, shakes his head in anguish. 
ALPHA Ay, yi, yi, yi, yi .

55C   EXT.  DULCEA'S GARDEN / PHAEDOS - NIGHT             55C 
The Rangers are fast asleep.  A night wind WHISTLES through the trees, causing the branches to shiver. 
After a moment, there's movement in the bushes.  Suddenly, amazingly, a WOLF emerges -- his mane glistening in the 
moonlight, his eyes GLOWING LIKE FIRE. 
He surveys the sleeping clan, moves straight toward Billy.  He stands inches away from him, watches him with an intense gaze. Billy stirs slightly. 
The embers cast an orange glow on Kimberly's sleeping face A SHADOW moves over her and two CRANE LEGS step into frame. 
There's a FLURRY OF FLAPPING WINGS as a FALCON SWOOPS DOWN and lands on a rock directly above Tommy.  The bird fixes on Tommy with its piercing eyes. 
We hear a GRUNTING SOUND as the SILHOUETTE OF AN APE APPEARS: 
Now a FROG HOPS through the air and lands inches away from Adam.  The frog sits there a moment, it's THROAT THROBBING 
Now we hear a DEEP GROWL and a tree SHAKES.  Aisha fidgets in her sleep as an ENORMOUS BEAR SHADOW FALLS OVER HER. 
Now, all at once, the six animals VANISH INTO THIN AIR LIKE SPIRITS OF THE NIGHT. 
55D    EXT.  CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT  (PART OLD SC 55B)     55D 
Ivan and Goldar patrol the parents who are busy digging. 
IVAN Let's pick it up here!  I've got a schedule to keep.  In twenty four hours the ooze is gonna hit the fan! 
Goldar suddenly point to the sky. 
GOLDAR Hey, boss! 
THE TENGU DROPS INTO THE SCENE, SQUEALING 
MORDANT What kind of landing was that?! These clowns are a menace to the sky 
IVAN How did you fare? 
Mordant waves Ivan off. 
MORDANT Oh, it couldn't've gone better. The Power Rangers didn't know what hit them . 
The Tengu appear, one of them SQUAWKS and makes grand gestures. 
MORDANT That's right.  And then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river! 
IVAN So they've been destroyed? 
The Tengu SQUAWKS some more. 
MORDANT "Basically". 
IVAN What do you mean "basically"? 
MORDANT Well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere! 
MORDANT Okay, maybe he wasn't so huge. But you should've seen the size of his STICKS 
A pensive look comes over Ivan... 
IVAN Did these sticks make a whistling sound? 
MORDANT How'd you know? 
IVAN Dulcea! (beat) That miserable, manipulating loathsome she-devil of a WITCH!! 
To help make the point Mordant SPITS on the ground. 
IVAN How could you let them get away?! If Dulcea leads them to the Great Power, everything will be ruined! They must be OBLITERATED! 
One of the Tengu SCREECHES again. 
MORDANT What're you talking about?!  It wasn't my fault!  You're the featherbrains that let them get away! 
Ivan looks up to the sky. 
IVAN I call upon the Powers of Darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold! 
The Queen FIRES ANOTHER BLAST. 
ROCKY LOOK OUT! 
Rocky DIVES, knocking Aisha away from the bolt. 
Adam and one of the Tengu circle each other warily. 
ADAM The frog silently assesses its target, then strikes out... 
Suddenly the Tengu is HURTLED BACKWARD TEN FEET THROUGH THE AIR.  We didn't even see Adam move. 
ADAM ... in the blink of an eye. 
Tommy steps up behind a Tengu. 
TOMMY Yo, Tweety! 
The Tengu turns around and Tommy WHALLOPS HIM WITH A SPINNING- HEEL KICK.  A Tengu faces down Aisha and she goes into a bear stance. 
AISHA The bear is sturdy as a towering tree.  Nothing can uproot it. 
The Tengu CHARGES LIKE A BULL, SLAMS INTO AISHA.  She holds fast and the bird EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS. 
AISHA Bye, bye birdy. 
Kimberly continues balancing precariously on the bridge as she EXCHANGES BLOWS with her foe. 
She finally drops into a crane stance... then just like Dulcea she LEAPS THROUGH THE AIR, EXECUTES A BRUTAL SPINNING HELL KICK and sends the birdman TUMBLING OFF THE BRIDGE. 
In a movement that seems to defy gravity, she lands perfcctly back on the swinging bridge. 
KIMBERLY Hasta la Pasta, Bigbird! 
Billy swings his sticks, BASHES one of the Tengu in the beak -- the creature EXPLODES INTO A CLOUD OF FEATHERS! 
BILLY AIM FOR THEIR BEAKS! 
Tommy reaches the top of a rack.  He sees a Tengu making a KAMIKAZE DIVE TOWARD KIMBERLY.  TOMMY DIVES, SOARING THIRTY FEET THROUGH THE AIR -- HE INTERCEPTS THE TENGU AND THEY SPIN TOWARD EARTH TOGETHER.  They HIT the ground and EXCHANGE BLOWS AS THEY FALL OVER ONE ANOTHER. 
Rocky SLAMS another Tengu in the beak, KABLAM  -- the creature is OBLITERATED. 
Tommy LEAPS INTO THE AIR, NAILS two Tengu in the beaks.  They BOTH BURST IN AN EXPLOSION OF FEATHERS. 
The Queen shoots another BOLT OF ENERGY --  a rock EXPLODES, SHOWERING THE KIDS WITH SHRAPNEL.  Aisha turns to Rocky. 
AISHA It's up to you. 
Rocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position. Incredibly he SCALES THE WALL IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT UP THE POLE.  HE FLIPS OVER THE TOP and lands right before the Queen Tengu.  He looks her dead in the eye. 
ROCKY Polly wanna cracker? 
With that, he executes a devastating SPINNING-HEEL KICK and the Queen BURSTS INTO OBLIVION. 
KIMBERLY ALL RIGHT, ROCKY! 
Instantly, the remaining Tengu retreat, SQUAWKING and CAWWING  in rage.  The kids turn to eaeh other, sharing in a moment of triumph. 
ADAM WE DID IT!! 
72   EXT.  ANGEL GROVE TOWER - DAY                               72 
We're on top of a high tower overlooking the entire city There's a BURST OF PURPLE SMOKE -- Ivan, Mordant and Goldar appear.  Ivan looks out on the city, holds up his arms theatrically. 
IVAN ANGEL GROVE... I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO A COUPLE OF MY NEAREST AND DEAREST FRIENDS... HORNITOR! 
HORNITOR APPEARS on the street ROARING like a fiend.  His enormous foot DROPS DOWN AND CRUSHES A CAR INTO OBLIVION. 
IVAN And his trimetallic partner in crime... SCORPITRON!! 
SCORPITRON APPEARS on the street and BASHES IN THE SIDE OF A BUILDING, SENDING GLASS AND DEBRIS EVERYWHERE. 
IVAN THE BOYS ARE BACK IN TOWN!!! 
GOLDAR GO IVAN!! 
Mordant turns to Ivan and throws his arms up in jubilation. 
TOMMY Six become one... the combined forces of the Ninjetti. 
ROCKY Strength in numbers!! 
They silently assemble in a line, all of them interlock: hands.  They face the Monolith with fire in their eyes. 
BILLY I am the wolf, cunning and swift! 
KIMBERLY I am the crane, agile and sublime! 
AISHA I am the bear, stalwart and bold! 
ADAM I am the frog, quick as lightning! 
ROCKY I am the mighty ape! 
TOMMY And I am the Falcon, Winged Lord of the Sky! 
RANGERS WE... ARE THE NINJETTI!!! 
A mysterious HALO OF LIGHT SHROUDS the Rangers and they dissapear INTO THIN AIR.

75C   INT.  MONOLITH - DAY                                       75C 
The kids BURST THROUGH A WALL OF LIGHT and come down together inside a vast cavern.  There's a pyramid shaped steel object in the center of the room, a RADIANT LIGHT SHINING FROM IT. 
AISHA What HAPPENED?! 
ADAM Where are we?! 
BILLY Of course!  The power is of another world.  Another dimension. 
KIMBERLY WE'VE GOT TEN TRIACS BEFORE WE'RE TOAST!! 
ROCKY That's twenty seconds!! 
The kids advance toward the pyramid. 
TOMMY Release the power WITH the power. 
AISHA What does that mean?! 
Adam notices their symbols are glowing. 
BILLY Our SYMBOLS. 
The kids ogle the radiant emblems.  Kimberly takes hold of hers and it COMES OFF in her hand -- there's a mirror on the other side. 
ROCKY Ten seconds and counting!! 
KIMBERLY It's some kind of mirror! 
Kimberly looks at her reflection and primps her hair.  The other's remove their symbols. 
AISHA Release the power with the power. 
BILLY I've got it!  We use the mirrors to reflect the light back into itself!! 
ROCKY THREE SECONDS!! 
TOMMY LET'S DO IT!? 
All of them turn their mirrors toward the pyramid.  A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOT FROM THE POWER; INTO THE MIRRORS AND BACK IN TO THE POWER. 
We hear a RUMBLING SOUND as the earth starts to SHAKE.  The Rangers look to each other, horrified. 
Then everything falls still and silent... and then a miracle happens. 
We hear a HARMONIOUS, OTHERWORLDLY CHORUS as the pyramid OPENS UP, REVEALING THE MOST GLORIOUS SOURCE OF LIGHT IN THE UNIVERSE. 
The kids shield their eyes from the brilliance, all of them wearing wonder-struck expressions. 
SIX BEAMS OF COLORED LIGHT SHOOT OUT AND HIT EACH OF THE RANGERS...  AND THEIR POWER RANGERS UNIFORMS MATERIALIZE ON THEM!  Their visors are clear so we can see their faces. 
TOMMY WE HAVE THE GREAT POWER!! 
Alpha approaches, speaks in an anguished voice. 
ALPHA 5 Rangers...  I'm afraid you're too late. 
AISHA What?! 
ALPHA 5 Zordon...  he's gone. 
The Rangers are too stunned to speak.  They approach Zordon's lifeless form looking absolutely devastated. 
KIMBERLY ... This can't be... 
They stare at Zordon with gut-wrenching expressions.  They're utterly defeated. 
Eventually, Tommy looks to the others and speaks in a fervent voice. 
TOMMY "To those who possess the Great Power...   all things are possible." 
The kids gradually exchange zealous looks.  They form a circle around Zordon and interlock hands. 
They close their eyes, bow their heads... 
After a long moment, a SHIMMERING ENERGY BEGINS TO FLOW DOWN FROM THE RANGERS, INTO ZORDON'S ASTRAL FORM. 
Zordon grows BRIGHTER and BRIGHTER and then there's a DAZZLING, STROBOSCOPIC EXPLOSION. 
When the LIGHT FADES WE SEE THE COMMAND CENTER BACK IN ITS ORIGINAL, PRISTINE FORM. 
Zordon's youthful face once again looks down from within his pillar of light, his eyes filled with a fierce pride. 
RANGERS ZORDON!! 
ZORDON Welcome back, kids. 
ADAM It's good to be back. 
Alpha jumps up and down like a child. 
ALPHA 5 HE'S ALIVE!  HE'S ALIVE! 
KIMBERLY We thought you... 
ZORDON It's good to see you again, too. 
Alpha sees the Ecto-Morphicon machines on the VIEWING GLOBE. 
ALPHA  5 AI, YI, YI, YI, YI   Ivan s Ecto- Morphicon machines are leveling the city! 
ROCKY We've got news for you, Ivan...

CLOSE ON IVAN as he TURNS INTO CAMERA, a startled look on his face.

IVAN (outraged) POWER RANGERS! 
80   EXT.  CITY STREETS                                          80 
The Rangers watch as Hornitor and Scorpitron come THUNDERING down the street toward them. 
KIMBERLY What're THOSE?! 
We hear Alpha on Tommy's wrist communicator. 
ALPHA 5  (V. 0.) Rangers, call for your new animal Zords! 
TOMMY Let's DO it! 
Mordant and Goldar watch popeyed as IVAN'S BODY STRETCHES OUT LIKE A HUGE PIECE OF GUM. 
He STRETCHES and STRETCHES until his head BURSTS THROUGH THE STOMACH OF SCORPITRON. 
We hear a resounding SNAP AS IVAN'S FEET ARE RELEASED FROM THE ROOFTOP AND HIS ENTIRE BEING SPURTS INSIDE THE GIANT'S BELLY. 
Now there's all sorts of GURGLING and SLURPING sounds as the monster's face SHAPE-SHIFTS INTO IVAN'S FACE! 
He grins, revealing his silver tooth. 
IVAN Let's TANGO! 
TOMMY  (V.O.) We need Ninja MEGAZORD POWER, NOW! 
There's amazing PYROTECHNICS AS FIVE ANIMAL ZORDS MERGE TOGETHER AND TRANSFORM INTO THE NINJA MEGAZORD.

Ivan/Scorpitron SINGES the Megazord with a DEVASTATING LASER BLAST, SENDING IT TUMBLING BACKWARD.

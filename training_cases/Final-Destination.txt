FINAL DESTINATION 
"FINAL DESTINATION" 
Originally Called "FLIGHT 180" 
By James Wong and Glen Morgan 
January 15, 1999 
Awaiting......each of us; a cold...dark...lonely place. Deny its finality. Deride its totality. Dread the inescapable inevitability......it will arrive. 
The BLACK SILENT SCREEN senses this moment before a distant blues harp introduces a contemporary band's cover of Blood, Sweat, and Tears' campy, yet haunting, gospel, "And When I Die." 
As the Introduction closes, RESONATES... A FLASH OF LIGHTING! A CRACK OF THUNDER! 
CUT TO: 
INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE - BED 
An airline ticket is tossed INTO FRAME beside a suitcase; "EURO-AIR. FLIGHT #180. New York City (JFK) - Paris, Charles de Gaulle (CDG.) Departure: Thursday 13May. 16H25 - Arrival: Friday 14May. 05H40." 
"And When I Die" Continues throughout the MAIN TITLES: 
AN OLD TABLE FAN 
swivels beside and open window. Outside, a humid spring THUNDER STORM drops warm, ominous rain. The figure of a seventeen year old boy, ALEX BROWNING, packing for a trip, passing the fan... 
THE BED 
A Paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE BOOK as the fan's breezes flip through the pages. 
THE TABLE FAN 
turns, head swiveling away from the bed. 
TIGHTER - THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES 
stop flipping, REVEALING A GULLOTINE from the Reign of Terror. As an American passport is dropped beside the guidebook... 
THE TABLE FAN 
swivels, returning towards the guidebook on the bed. 
THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES 
FLIP. FLIP. FLIP. Alex's faint shadow continues moving about the room. The fan head swivels away, allowing the pages to settle... upon a Louvre masterpiece, Francisco de Zurbarans Lying-in-the State of St. Bonaventura. 
CAMERA CREEPS IN, teasingly on the dark faced corpse. The pages begin to turn once again. 
TIGHTER, OMINOUS ANGLE - THE DESK FAN 
There is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels. The boy's figure passes, blocking the breeze. 
THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES 
stop dead on... Jim Morrison's decorated tomb in the Cemetiere du Pere Lachaise. A pilgrim has spray painted "This is the End." Which in fact, it is... of the MAIN TITLE. 
BARBARA Alex... 
CAMERA ADJUSTS, to fully reveal Alex Browning as he turns toward the bedroom door. Alex is an average kid; handsome. A high school "everyman." 
One the wall amongst Yankee and Knicks posters, hangs a pennant; "Mt. Abraham High School, New York. The Fighting Colonials!" Alex's mother, BARBARA, 45, walks in, excited and a bit anxious. 
BARABRA (Cont'd) Tod and George's dad just called, he's picking you up at 10 in the morning. Bus leaves the high school for JFK at noon. 
Barbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack. Alex's father, KEN BROWNING, 48 appears, leaning against the door threshold, smiling enviously at his son. 
KEN My suitcase workin' out for ya? 
Alex nods and buckles it. Barbara reaches in to tear off an airline baggage I.D. ticket attached from the previous flight. 
ALEX Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave that on. It's like... the tag made the last flight without crashin' or anything, right? So, it should stay on, or with, the bag for good luck. 
BARBARA Where would you get a nutball idea like that? 
EXTREMELY CLOSE - THE AIRLINE BAGGAGE MARKER 
is torn away from the suitcase handle. 
RETURN 
As Barbara picks up the suitcase to place it on the floor... a dozen old baggage I.D. tickets spill from the outer compartment. She looks at Ken, as if "you?" The guilty party shrugs. 
KEN I'm still here. 
Barbara shakes her head as Alex smiles at his dad. 
KEN (Cont'd) Seventeen and on the loose. Ten days in Paris. In the springtime! Live it up, Alex... 
CAMERA INCHES INTO KEN as he winks at his son... 
KEN (Cont'd) Got your whole life ahead of you. 
ALEX 
Mr. Murnau scans the group, his expression looking for an answer. Clear Rivers keeps her head in her book as... 
CLEAR The airport doesn't endorse solicitors. 
MR. MURNAU Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit! 
She doesn't react. Her expression remains cool as Murnau leads the procession forward. The boys continue. Alex sighs... 
ALEX Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with that shit the whole time? 
A hand reaches out to gently detain Alex. He looks up to find a HARE KRISHANA, dressed in everyday clothes, but head shaved and a mark on his nose. 
HARE KRISHANA Death is not the end. 
CAMARA PUSHES IN ON ALEX... unsettled by the soft spoken, yet ominous, "Solicitation." The Krishana offers a small book, REALITY BEYOND THE MATTER: VAISHNAVA PHILOSOPHY. 
As he hands the book to Alex, a female form ENTERS FRAME between them. The women is MISS VALERIE LEWTON, 30, a feisty English teacher whose figure inspires all the boys' fantasies. 
MS. LEWTON It will be for you if you harass my students. 
She places a hand on Alex's shoulder, herding him to the group. 
HARE KRISHANA (pissy) Hare Rama. 
Ms. Lewton turns and, while walking backward, flashes a smile... 
MS. LEWTON (mouths) Fuck off. 
As she turns her back and continues down the terminal... 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHECK IN DESK - AIRPORT - DAY 
Alex's passport and ticket are set INTO FRAME and picked up by a female TICKET CLERK. Alex waits as she busily types into the computer and checks his passport... 
TICKET CLERK I have a few questions to ask you this afternoon. 
O.S., LOUD, EXAGGERATED plastic tiles rapidly CLICK and CLACK. 
TICKET CLERK (CONT'D) Did you pack these bags yourself? 
The CLACKING CONTINUES, demading Alex's attention. His eyes turn forward. 
ALEX'S POV - THE FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD 
Plastic tabs CLACK rapidly, settling on the word... "CANCELLED." 
ALEX 
CAMARA CREEPS IN on his dawning paranoia... 
TICKET CLERK (CONT'D, O.S.) Have your belongings remained in your possession the entire time? 
Alex absently nods. Again, O.S., CLACK CLACK CLACK. His eyes move to... 
ALEX'S POV - (TIGHTER) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD 
The plastic tabs FLIP and CLACK rapidly, stopping on... "DEPARTED." 
TICKET DESK 
Alex is still considering the "messages..." 
TICKET CLERK Have you recieved any packages from persons unknown to you? 
Alex quickly runs the day through his head and flashes her the REALITY BEYOND MATTER book. She smiles, then leans over toward the baggage scales. Alex's eyes turn toward... 
CLOSE - (MOTION SLOWED)- ALEX'S LUGGAGE 
a new airline I.D. marker is attached to his bag. 
RETURN 
Alex eyes the new tag hoping it's "good luck." As the clerk returns his ticket and passport... CLACK, CLACK, CLACK. 
TICKET CLERK Same as your birthday. 
Alex is puzzeled by the comment. He shakes his head if, "pardon me?" CAMERA INCHES INTO the ticket clerk gesturing pleasantly to the passport and ticket... 
TICKET CLERK (CONT'D) April 25th. Four-twenty-five... your birthday is the same as your departure time. 
CLACK. CLACK. CLACK. Alex's eyes flash toward... 
ALEX'S POV - (FULL FRAME) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD 
the title settles upon... "TERMINAL." 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SECURITY AREA - AIRPORT - MONITOR 
The ghastly green and reds of the X-ray monitors flash as carry on bags flash through the machine. CAMERA MOVES COUNTER to the direction of the conveyor belt. The pace and excitement of the collective group escalates as departure approaches. 
Carter Horton and his girlfriend, Terry, take cuts in line with smug, bullying expressions. Unseen by the chaperones, no student, has the nerve to protest Carter's action. Alex, Tod, George and BILLY HITCHCOCK, heavyset with a New York Rangers jersey watches Carter and Terry with disgust. 
his hand trembles as he reaches for the oxygen mask and places it over his face. The ENGINES resuscitate. SCREAMING. WHINING. Alex checks out his window. 
ALEX'S POV - OUT OF WINDOW 
The plane is on its side, losing altitude. A slow, sick spin. 
ALEX 
breaths deep into his oxygen cup. 
The JET ENGINES GRIND AND WHIR, as if the craft were in the midst of a last-ditch effort to regain stability; the sounds DEAFENING over the PASSENGERS' cruelly hopeless SCREAMS. 
Then... 
KA-BOOM 
A DEVASTATING EXPLOSION ERUPTS across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds. 
Dead students sit lifeless in their seats. 
Every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. A PARENT and a STUDENT clutch their seat in terror, SCREAMING before they are pulled into the sky. 
Wind. Screams. Dying engines, a deafening blare. 
ALEX AND TOD 
SCREAM, pale, knowing there is no hope, no escape as the ENGINES DIE. The cabin begins to tilt downwards... then straight down. Debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff. 
OUTSIDE... the sick familiar SOUND of an aircraft going down. 
ALEX is strapped to his seat, upper body facing downward toward the water. FIRE, WIND, AND BLOOD WHIP across him. A BUILDING WHINE CRESCENDOES before a second EXPLOSION RIPS ACROSS FRAME... 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE - ALEX'S TERRIFIED EYES 
dilating rapidly, as the shock of what appears to be happening before him washes over his very psyche. 
CHRISTA (O.S.) Alex? 
ALEX 
Drenched with sweat, trembling in his seat, his eyes dart toward Christa and Blake. They look great and they're workin' the sex appeal. 
CHRISTA Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together? I asked Tod, but he's got some medical thing. 
Alex turns sickeningly disoriented. His eyes dart about, searching for evidnece of the catastrophe. There are none to be found. Alex blots from his seat, startling the two girls. He scrambles toward Tod, who looks at his friend, concerned. 
TOD Dude, what up? 
Frenzied, Alex climbs over his friend, on top of the seat. Alex's panic has alerted the other students and a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT who makes his way to the row. 
ALEX 
grabs the tray table latch before the vacent seat. IT BREAKS OFF, JUST AS BEFORE. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, terrified. He begins to hyperventilate. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Is there a a problem, sir? 
Alex's wild eyes and expression convey "no fucking kidding there's a problem." The flight attendant realizes this passenger is experiencing a serious episode. 
Directly across the aisle, Carter Horton and Terry look at him with severe expressions. 
CARTER What's your fuckin' problem? 
Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton unfasten their seat belts and rush toward Alex. 
MR. MURNAU Alex? Qu'est-ce se? 
ALEX Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA EXPLODE! 
Obviously, no one ever wants to ever hear that. The students tense. 
THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT 
immediately turns to other attendants, signaling for assistance with a quick definite gesture. In the b.g., attendants hustle toward the economy class cabin. 
CARTER AND TERRY 
CARTER                TERRY Shut up, Browning!       You're not funny. 
ALEX 
frenzied, begins moving toward the aisle. 
ALEX We have to get out! 
This frightens everyone. Not the "prophecy," but his panicky, irrational behavior. 
ALEX (CONT'D) We have to get off this plane! 
CLEAR RIVERS 
CAMERA PUSHES INTO HER, hearing Alex's declaration. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Now! NOW!! 
Hustling toward the door. Mr. Murnau gestures toward Ms. Lewton as if "talk to her." He disappears down the ramp. CAMERA PUSHES IN as airline personnel CLOSE THE DOOR...with an ominous THUD. 
EXT. GATE 39 - AFTERNOON - CARTER, TERRY & BILLY'S POV 
Flight 180 pulls out of the gate, taxiing toward the runway. 
INT. GATE 39 - OBSERVATION WINDOW - AFTERNOON 
Carter turns over his shoulder, looking back angrily towards Alex. Terry wraps a calming/restraining arm around Carter's shoulder, but he starts towards Alex, seated with Ms. Lewton. 
MENS ROOM ACROSS FROM GATE 39 
Tod races out of the bathroom with a dampened paper towel. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he hands it to Ms. Lewton seated next to Alex. The teacher places it on Alex's forehead. 
TOD I called your mom and dad and they're on their way. 
MS. LEWTON Alex, talk to me. What happened? 
Alex looks at Tod, who nods. His friend's expression is soothing and open. With lowered tense tone, meant for only the two people beside him... 
ALEX I... I saw it... like, I don't know... the plane took off. I saw it leave the runway... I looked down and saw the ground... 
Ms. Lewton and Tod exchange concered glances. 
ALEX (CONT'D) And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes. 
TOD Been on many planes that blew up, have you? 
Good point. Alex looks away. 
MS. LEWTON You must have fallen asleep. 
CARTER We get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in Paris because Browning has a bad dream? (mocking Alex) It's going to explode! It's going to explode! 
TOD Fuck off, Horton. 
MS. LEWTON Tod... 
A raw nerve, Alex stands. 
ALEX Only trip you're gonna take is to the fuckin' hospital. 
Carter scoffs while moving aggressively toward Alex. 
Carter makes a quick move and grabs Alex. The two security guards rush in to break it up. Chaos erupts agian as the two boys wrestle in the terminal. 
OBSERVATION DECK 
CAMERA PUSHES INTO Billy Hitchcock, depressed as he watches the plane take off... 
BILLY There they go and here we stay. 
AIRPORT TERMINAL 
One guard restrains Alex; another Carter. In the b.g. out of the observation deck window... Flight 180 lifts off the runway. 
CARTER You're payin' for my trip, Browning! 
ALEX I wish you were on the plane! 
In the b.g. the 747 head and taillights suddenly, violently, ERUPT into a gigantic fireball of flame. 
It takes a few seconds for the CONCUSSION to hit the terminal, but when it does... BOOM! A window SHATTERS! Chairs rock! People are knocked off their feet. 
CAMERA SWEEPS INTO ALEX... stunned as he turns to the window... 
ALEX'S POV - FLIGHT 180 
The unceremonious speed of obliteration of hundreds of lives is cruel as flaming debris plummets from the early evening sky. 
CLEAR RIVERS 
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, rattled, afraid, but aware of Alex as she is first to turn her eyes toward him. 
GATE 39 
Billy Hitchcock walks backward from the window, shocked by shocked step. Ms. Lewton drops to her chair as her legs give out. 
O.S., ALARMS BEGIN. The two security guards tear off toward more urgent duties. O.S., OUTSIDE, SIRENS WAIL as emergency vehicles race to the tragedy. 
CAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE toward ALEX... as Tod's head turns toward him, then Terry's... then Carter's. In the chair, beginning to cry, Ms. Lewton eyes Alex, as if afraid of him. 
CAMERA CONTINUES. SIRENS PIERCING. The emergency vehicles' strobing red lights reflect in Alex's eyes, now in TIGHT as he looks out, frozen with shock... upon the doomed FLIGHT 180. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT 
SILENCE 
A pair of Airline REPRESENTATIVES sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock. Everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion. They sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights. Beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe... each feels uneasy by Alex's presance. 
The others sit away from Alex and Tod. Alex appears wrought with guilt. He checks the others out of the corner of his eye. 
ALEX'S POV - THE ROOM 
He considers, owing them an explanation. The he realizes... 
ALEX Because... I... never thought it would really happen. 
Weine leans foward... 
WEINE If that's the case, Alex... why did you really get off the plane? 
CAMERA INCHES IN as Alex considers, confused, emotional... 
CUT TO: 
INT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - TOD 
CAMERA CONTINUES THE MOVE on Tod... as if just realizing... 
TOD My brother... told me to keep an eye on Alex. He stayed... and I went to make sure Alex was okay. (a whisper) He told me to get off the plane. INT. A SECOND ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - MS. LEWTON 
displaying a similar sickened expression as Tod... 
MS. LEWTON Larry Murnau told me to get back on... but I told him to go. (pause, guiltily) I sent him back on the plane. 
INT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - WEINE 
WEINE No one forced you to get off the plane. You told us you aren't friends with any that did... so, why did you leave the airplane? 
CLEAR RIVERS 
CAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up. With total resolve... 
CLEAR Because I saw and I heard Alex. And... I believed him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL BUILDING - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT 
The surviviors have all returned to the room. They may be a group, but they are alone with their thoughts. The door is opened by Ms. Whale. 
Alex's Mother and Father lead by a group of parents into the room. Each moves with grief, yet relief, to their child. 
Barbara Browning grabs hold of Alex and holds him tight. The mother begins to cry. Ken Browning, eyes welling with tears, grabs his son's hand and squeezes. Alex does not cry. While holding his mother, he watches the others. 
ALEX'S POV - CARTER AND TERRY 
Their parents are concerned, but do not demonstratively show affection. Carter appears as if he wants to hug his MOTHER, but he can't bring himself to betray his self-image. 
ALEX 
his eyes moves toward... 
CLEAR RIVERS 
alone, hurt that no one has come to take her home. 
ALEX 
his eyes find... 
TOD AND HIS FATHER 
JERRY WAGGNER holds his son, both of them releasing anguished tears. Through his grief, however, Jerry stares at Alex with an expression of anger and accusation. 
ALEX 
CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he holds his mother tightly. OVERLAPPING... A CRACK OF THUNDER! 
CUT TO: 
INT. KEN BROWNING'S CAR - NIGHT 
Alex sits in the back against the door, looking out the window at the storm. Clear Rivers is pressed against the other door. Everyone is slient. Outside, the STORM angrily rages. 
Alex is unaware that Clear is watching him, searching for some answer that she will not now find. She looks up. 
CLEAR Here's good. 
The car pulls over. 
CLEAR Thank you for the ride. She opens the door and flashes one more look at Alex, but he appears unaware. She exits the car and as the door SHUTS... 
CUT TO: 
INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The room is empty, but the CAMERA is SLOWLY MOVING, as if ITSELF a PRESENCE. O.S., FOOTSTEPS move up the stairs. Alex appears, his parents behind him. He clicks on the light, sending a soft, safe, orange glow across the room. 
ALEX 
stands in the threshold of the doorway. His mother places a comforting hand on his shoulder. 
ALEX'S POV - PENNANT 
Mt. Abraham High School Fighting Colonials. 
ALEX 
CARTER Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything. 
ALEX I don't. 
CARTER (re: victims) All I owe is these people. (turns to Alex) To live my life to the fullest. 
Alex winces from Carter's breath... 
ALEX Then maybe you should lay off the J.D. 
Carter has an angry reflexive reaction, grabbing Alex threateningly by the forearm. Terry immediately tries to get Carter to release his hold. 
CARTER Don't ever fucking again tell me what to do. I control me. Not you. 
Carter and Alex lock eyes, Alex refraining from showing any pain caused by Carter's grip. Terry finally gets him to release. 
CARTER I'm never gonna die. 
He moves off. Terry, however, holds a beat, eyes Alex and gently rubs the area of his arm, as if this is the only manner she can extend her gratitiude in Carter's presence. As Alex pats her arm, Terry quickly moves off. 
Shaken, Alex considers whether to move foward to the memorial. He steps aside to let the others go ahead as Billy Hitchcock, who has finished paying his respects, spots Alex and heads back up the line. 
BILLY I took my driver's test this week at the DMV... 
Alex turns to him, increudlously.. 
BILLY Got a 70. Lowest score, but I passed. When I was done with the test, the guy who drives with you during the test, he goes, "Young man, you're going to die at a very young age." (beat) That true? ALEX Not here, not now. (beat) Not EVER! 
Billy sighs, and moves OUT OF FRAME, only to quickly RE-ENTER... 
BILLY If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will she say "no?" 
Alex flashes Billy an angry glare. He gets the message and moves off, for good. Alex returns in line, moving toward the memorial. 
Valerie Lewton places a rose at the base of the memorial then studies the engraved names as the students move past behind her. Alex approaches, watching her as she reaches out with a trembling finger, touching the etched names... 
CLOSE - MEMORIAL 
Linda Krauss... Thomas Lewis... John McConnell. 
RETURN 
Alex stands near her, sympathetically, understanding her pain.... 
ALEX Ms. Lewton... 
Her eyes fill with tears and fear. Alex places a comforting hand on her shoulder, but she reacts quickly, pulling away from him, her eyes piercing at him. 
MS. LEWTON Don't talk to me. You scare the hell out of me. 
Alex is shattered as the teacher moves away. Tod ENTERS and faces the memorial. 
TOD (a greeting) Hey. 
Alex notices Tod is in line behind him. Alex looks around for Tod's father. He is not in line... 
ALEX I don't want to sound gay, or nothin, but... I miss you. 
Tod subtly nods, reaching out to the memorial. 
CLOSE - MEMORIAL 
Tod's hand moves across his brother's name... GEORGE WAGGNER. 
RETURN 
As Tod longs for his brother, then looks at his friend. 
TOD Me, too. (beat) But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks. 
ALEX That's a plan. 
Tod nods. The two friends stand uncomfortably foar a beat before Tod gestures to the podium. 
TOD I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton showed me in her class, they're gonna let me read it. It says what I'm feeling. 
Tod holds his friend's arm for strength as he passes. Clear Rivers appears in line, holding a rose. She looks at the memorial, before her startling eyes turn to Alex. Even away from these circumstances, Alex would have trouble handling her intense maturity. As he begins to step away, she thrusts the rose to him. He looks up, puzzled. 
CLEAR Because of you... I'm still alive. Thank you. 
Alex takes the rose and she walks away. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he eyes... feels... the red flower. 
TOD (V.O.) We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast... 
TIME CUT: 
EXT. MT ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - THE PODIUM 
Tod nervously stands before the assembly, reading aloud with a sad, yet optimistic resolve. CAMERA PUSHES IN, at an ominous ANGLE and rhythm, to the podium. 
TOD (CONT'D) But when we say this, we imagine that the hour is placed in an obscure and distant future. 
As he speaks, the sunlight suddenly turns to shadow. 
ALEX 
TOD 
turns on the faucet and grabs his toothbrush, squeezing paste onto the bristles. 
CLOSE - FAUCET 
the f.g. running water is out of FOCUS. In the b.g. sits an unplugged radio. 
TOD 
notes the radio. CAMERA FLLOWS HIS HAND as he grabs the plug. 
THE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR 
grows closer to his foot... 
ELECTRICAL SOCKET 
the radio plug is inserted. 
TOD 
turns on the radio... 
JOHN DENVER (V.O.) And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun. 
spooked, quickly turns it off, unplugs it and pushes it aside. 
THE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR 
continues to grow... 
CUT TO: 
INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - NEWSPHOTO - CLEAR RIVERS 
Odd how one can appear so erotic at a funeral. 
ALEX 
studies the photograph, then notices the rose she gave him. Succumbing to guilt, feeling like the freak all teenagers believe they are, Alex sets the paper back on the desk. He grabs the Penthouse and turns, opening the desk drawer in order to return the magazine, however... 
A LOUD BANG turns Alex's head to the window! 
ALEX'S POV - WINDOW 
An OWL has apparently smashed into the window, awkwardly flapping its large wings, then turns its head toward Alex, large yellow eyes shining like an alien creature. 
WIDER 
Startled, Alex reflexively throws the Penthouse across the room, pages tearing as it hits the sill. The giant bird flies off. 
THE TABLE FAN 
swivels, a page catching in the whirling blades. 
A PIECE OF PAPER 
torn form the magazine flits across the room. 
ALEX 
CAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as the piece of paper ENTERS FRAME, floating and flitting until landing on his knee. He picks it up and turns it over... 
ALEX'S POV - PIECE OF PAPER 
is torn in such a manner that the only lettlers remaining from the centerfold's caption are "...Tod..." 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT - SHOWER CURTAIN 
is pulled aside REVEALING two pairs of Linda Waggner's nylons drying on a retractable clothesline. 
THE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR 
his foot slips... 
TOD 
falls foward. 
THE RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE 
retracts! WHIPPING wildly! 
THE SOAP DISH 
Tod's hand tries to grab anything to hold him. His hand slips, knocking over a bottle of shampoo. 
TOD'S NECK 
the thin clothesline coils around his neck. The plastic anchor wraps beneath the cord, essentially creating a noose. 
PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR 
CLEAR (CONT'D) (a warning) Get outta here! 
CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, stunned, but before he can ask any further questions, a METALLIC CLACKING draws his attention back toward the house. 
ALEX'S POV - A COVERED GURNEY 
is rolled out of the front door by paramedics and an official with a jacket marked "CORONER," Behind the body follows Tod's father. He pauses in the doorway as he spots Alex in the front yard. 
ALEX 
is pale, nauseous. His eyes follow his friend's dead body as it is rolled toward the paramedics vehicle. Tod's father approaches Alex, the agents stand nearby. 
ALEX What... what happened? 
Mr. Waggner glares at Alex, accusingly. 
MR. WAGGNER Didn't you... "see" it? 
Alex is stung, guilty. He averts his eyes. Schreck and Weine note this reaction. 
MR. WAGGNER (CONT'D) Couldn't you "predict" it? Couldn't you read his mind? Alex remains silent, hurt. 
ALEX Mr. Waggner... 
MR. WAGGNER You caused Tod so much guilt over George staying on the plane that... (breaking down) He took his own life. 
Alex is stunned, defensive. 
ALEX He wouldn't do it! 
Mr. Waggner turns toward the paramedics van, as if "there's the proof." 
ALEX He... he told me we would be friends again after you got better. After you got over George. Why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself? 
MR. WAGGNER All my wife and I will ever know is we wouldn't have lost our youngest son... if you'd told our oldest to get off the plane. 
Alex is rocked as if having taken a punch to the face. Mr. Waggner begins to walk toward the peramedics vehicle. Alex eyes the F.B.I. agents, who, after studying for a beat, turn and move toward their vehicle. 
The gathered spectators begin whispering to one another, clearly about Alex, causing him to search for, what appears to be, his only ally, Clear Rivers. 
ALEX'S POV - ADJACENT YARD 
Clear is gone. 
FRONT YARD 
everyone has moved away from Alex, leaving him very alone. Alex's eyes remained locked on the peramedics' vehicle. As the ambulance doors CLOSE on the body of his best friend... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY - CLOSE - LEAVES ON TREES 
A soft summer breeze passes through the leaves on a tree. A yellow leaf drops from the branch and flutters to the ground. CAMERA FOLLOWS until it falls upon an old cracked sidewalk. 
A pair of worn Nikes ENTER FRAME just as the leaf drops before them. The feet and CAMERA HOLD until CRANING UP to REVEAL Alex, staring at the leaf with an expression reminiscent of the torn paper's message about  "...Tod." 
CLEAR  (O.S.) Almost Autumn. 
Alex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor. 
ALEX It's only the end of June. 
CLEAR (shrugs) Yeah, but everthing's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming. (beat) Almost like bein' able... to see the future. 
Alex reads her intention loud and clear. She returns to her artwork. The dog GROWLS softly as Alex appraches the garage. 
INT/EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY 
Entering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that. 
CLEAR Know what this is? 
She gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal. 
ALEX Like, um... you're mad about something? 
She sighs, "thanks a lot," then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal. 
CLEAR A piece of debris... from the plane. I went to the shore off the crash site and it washed up on the beach. 
ALEX You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits. 
CLEAR It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you. 
Alex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear... 
ALEX Why were you there last night? 
While she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine... 
CLEAR Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen suicides. But they were there last night, that means: one, they still don't have a clue what caused the crash. Two, they haven't ruled out anything. And the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough, not to mention, that one of those people had a vision, or whatever, of it exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious. And it doesn't help that the visionaries' friend just committed suicide. 
Alex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf. 
ALEX Why were you there last night? 
CLOSE - ALEX'S HAND 
slides across the table. Opening his hand REVEALS the piece of paper reading, "... Tod..." Clear's hand ENTER'S FRAME to take the paper. CAMERA FOLLOWS AS SHE raises it, her expression obviously puzzled. As she eyes Alex for an explanation, CAMERA CRANES DOWN QUICKLY to the empty paper cups on the table... 
... a slight approaching BREEZE knocks them over. 
DOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST 
A somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the Starbucks. Carter Horton is driving. Terry Chaney rides shotgun. Carter looks out the window. 
CARTER'S POV - MOVING - ALEX AND CLEAR 
She holds the paper as Alex, apparently, explains the story. 
CARTER'S CAR 
CARTER scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems. 
ALEX AND CLEAR 
Her eyes turn from the paper to Alex, concerned about him... 
CLEAR I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like 		on the plane? 
ALEX No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design. 
CLEAR Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence. 
Alex nods, feeling she's understanding. 
ALEX The mortician said Death has a design. Now... if you, me, Tod, Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton messed up that design, because, for whatever reason, I was able to see Death's plan... then we cheated it. (beat) But what if it was our time, what if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it is still is our time? If... It... is still not finished with us? We will all still die; now, not later. 
Troubled and deeply concerned, Clear studies Alex. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Unless... we find the pattern. And cheat it again. 
Clear sets the paper down, looking sadly at Alex. 
CLEAR After hearing you, just now... I do believe... Alex leans back and sighs, relieved... 
CLEAR (CONT'D) ...that Tod killed himself. 
Alex is taken aback, hurt and angry. 
ALEX Then there's no one left who can help me. 
CARTER'S CAR 
His eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight U-Turn. 
BILLY HITCHCOCK 
rides his bike. He reacts, startled by... 
BILLY HITCHCOCK'S POV - CARTER'S CAR 
barreling down towards him. The car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the U-Turn. 
WIDER 
Billy SWERVES to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. The car SWERVES right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. The oncoming car HONKS! 
Carter's car pulls up to the curb. Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. Inside the car, Terry sighs... 
TERRY Baby, come on... not now. 
But her boyfriend continues. She gets out and hustles after him. 
ALEX AND CLEAR 
Their attention drawn by the commotion, Clear and Alex watch Carter Horton approach them, followed by Terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk. 
TERRY Carter... 
At that moment, Ms. Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself. 
CARTER Kind of have a reunion, here. 
TERRY Let it go! 
Carter steps before Ms. Lewton, blocking her exit... 
CARTER When are you moving? 
MS. LEWTON A couple of weeks. 
She can't wait to leave. While trying to walk around Carter... 
CARTER We're losing our favorite teacher. 
ALEX Look, there's something you should all know. 
CLEAR Alex... 
Carter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt. He raises the volume of his words to drown out Alex's words and incite conflict. 
Alex's finger quickly moves along the fuel line. After "TERRY," the seat intersecting the path of the fule line, over the fuel pump, is marked "MS. LEWTON."

INT. VALERIE LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - VALERIE LEWTON 
ENTER'S FRAME, on the phone, wearing a t-shirt and sweats. 
MS. LEWTON (O.S.) Some nights I'm woken up by the sound of my own voice, you know, inside my head, goin', "No, you know the whole French thing. Get on the plane." 
Moving boxes are stacked in the living room; organized disarray of relocating. The house is old, been in the family forever. Dust marks the walls where framed photos and artwork were once displayed. 
MS. LEWTON (CONT'D) Everything here reminds me... of sending Mr. Murnau back on the plane... Right, I'm hoping a change will help... I lived here my whole life and wherever I looked were great memories, you know... but now all I can see is Mr. Murnau... those kids. Just looking out my own front yard... makes me feel mothing but fear. 
She peeks out of the front curtains and looks sadly upon her front yard. Her expression alters... alarmed...

INT. MS. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ms. Lewton steps away from the curtains.

MS. LEWTON (CONT'D) This is Valerie Lewton. I need Agent Schreck... 
TIME CUT: 
EXT. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Alex has moved closer to her house, remaining in the shadows. He checks for any passers-by. Being sure there are none, he creeps toward Ms. Lewton's car. He visually inspects the exterior. As he kicks the tires... an unmarked sedan SCREECHES up. Doors open... 
Startled, Alex turns to find... 
Special agents Schreck and Weine standing in the street, backlit in the strong headlights of their car. 
SCHRECK What are you doing? 
ALEX 
is nervous but determined. He tells the truth... 
ALEX Checking the air in her tires to make sure they're safe. 
SPECIAL AGENTS SCHRECK AND WEINE 
after a beat of incredulity... 
SCHRECK Get in the car. 
INT. MS. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT - VALERIE LEWTON 
is watching, peeking out her front curtains. O.S., CAR DOORS CLOSE. The vehicle ROARS OFF. She releases the curtains and moves back, feeling somewhat better, but still rattled. 
Then... 
The curtains billow as if blown by a breeze. Ms. Lewton appears puzzled as she moves the curtains aside to find the windows closed. As CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, tensing and uneasy... 
CUT TO: 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Alex sits behind a table in the cinderblock room painted police station green. Sitting across from him, with a good cop tone, is Agent Weine, while Schreck stands with a hard-ass posture. 
ALEX I believe that... Ms. Lewton's next. 
WEINE "Next?" 
ALEX Yes... see, there's this... pattern... that's occuring. 
WEINE (sarcastic) Oh, you've noticed it, too? 
CUT TO: 
INT. MS. LEWTON'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ms. Lewton moves to a closet door, opens it and CLICKS on an overhead light. 
Kneeling down, she tugs on a heavy box and opens it to check the contents. Her expression warms, as if recalling a far off memory. 
MS. LEWTON Oh... mom's favorite. 
She slides a vinyl record album out of the sleeve and moves to the turntable on a shelf, thick with dust. 
Valerie places the record on the stereo and sets the needle on the album. CAMERA SWEEPS IN CLOSE TO THE TURNTABLE, although spinning around and around... the bold letters of the center label can be read... JOHN DENVER... the opening acoustic guitar of "Rocky Mountain High" has never sounded so eerie... 
JOHN DENVER (V.O.) He was born in the summer of his twenty-seventh year... 
Pleased with the feeling of a pleasant memory, Lewton moves off. 
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Trembling. She takes a deep breath, getting a hold of herself. 
MS. LEWTON You gotta stop this! Stop this! It's just a stupid mug. (composed) You're outta here. Pretty soon... you'll be gone. 
Opening the refrigerator frezzer, she grabs some ice and a bottle of pure Polish Vodka then deliberately turns back toward the same mug... 
COFFEE MUG 
the ice cubes PLUNK. The cold alchohol pours into the hot mug. CAMERA PUSHES INTO THE MUG as... it slightly CRACKS, Vodka dripping out of the base. 
Lewton's hand picks up the mug, oblivious to the crack. She moves off toward the living room, leaving a trail of alcohol.

Valerie Lewton tears off a piece of plastic bubble wrap. She stands over her desk, placed against the wall. On the desk is her desktop computer monitor.

JOHN DENVER I've seen it rainin' fire from the sky... 
CAMERA CRANES DOWN to REVEAL the moniter cabel inserted into an electrical wall socket. The vodka drip... drip... drips PAST FRAME. Then, Lewton's hand ENTERS and pulls the monitor plug, creating tiny SPARKS at the connection... 
ON THE FLOOR 
the alcohol ignites... 
MS. LEWTON 
her back is to the desk, while pouring styrofoam peanuts into the box. In the b.g., FLAMES, nearly supernaturally, leap up the walland toward the computer monitor. 
CLOSE - COMPUTER MONITOR - THROUGH THE VENTS 
the interior catches fire, causing an electrical POP! 
MS. LEWTON 
turns, holding her sheet of bubble wrap, shocked by the flames. 
THE COMPUTER MONITOR 
On the screen, the reflection of the approaching shadow passes before the monitor... EXPLODES! 
MS. LEWTON 
a large jagged shard from the monitor flies into her throat. Blood squirts from her neck onto the bubble wrap. Her stunned expression is sickeningly numb from shock. 
JOHN DENVER (V.O.) Rocky Mountain High/ Colorad-oh. 
She reaches up to reflexively pull the glass from her throat, creating a flood of spurting blood. 
She drops the glass and quickly stumbles toward the kitchen, blindly banging the turntable as she passes. The needle skips, BUMPS... and settles... umercifully at the start of "Rocky Mountain High." 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - NIGHT 
Alex walks quickly up the street. Smoke wafts before him. He turns to see a man burning leaves in the backyard. 
The breeze intensifies, lifting the burning debris. The smoke swirls around him. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX as he senses the Presence. He looks ahead. 
ALEX'S POV - TWO DOZEN LEAVES 
mystically float past him, each on fire. 
ALEX 
senses the taunting message and breaks into a full sprint, passing through many of the burning leaves that break up into the bright orange cinders against the black sky. 
CUT TO: 
Alex looks at Clear, her expression asking the same question... 
ALEX (quietly) Yeah. (almost to himself) When she died... at that moment, I could tell she saw something... horrible. 
The three others turn quiet, considering what it must be... 
CARTER Out of us... who's next to see it? 
Alex eyes them... hesitant to respond. 
BILLY Please tell me I'm gonna get to see the Jets win the Super Bowl. 
CARTER Me, right? That's why you're not saying. 
Billy looks out the window, despondent. 
BILLY Shoulda felt up Tammy in the pool, that time... 
CARTER (to Billy) Whatta you whinin' about? He said I'm next. 
CLEAR He didn't say nothin'. Just drive. 
CARTER You have a responsibility to tell me. 
ALEX Is knowing going to make it easier? It makes it harder. 
CARTER You get off havin' control over me. Let me choose how to deal with it. 
ALEX It doesn't matter who's next... we're all on the same list. 
The three are silent. 
CARTER Aww, fuck... really? 
Carter's expression becomes frightened, but he cannot have this. He counters with an irrational bravado. 
CARTER Then why bother? What's the fuckin' point? Terry and me will be back together on the other side, so why wait any longer? 
Carter bares down on the wheel, hits the GAS...

the passing shadow is darker than any surrounding darkness. 
CARTER 
as if the image has effected him, he looks to his lap belt and CLACKS the button. He tugs at the restraint, but it will not move. He's strapped in. 
He tries to open the door... it won't open. He pulls at the door handle... tugs at the seatbelt... panicked. Horrified, he whips towards the others. 
CARTER I can't get out!

Billy begins backing away from the others. 
finds his way to a chair in the center of the room, away from everything except a nearby table holding a fire extinguisher and a first aid kit, both at less than arm's reach. 
Unshaven, a week and a half's growth, and unkept, Alex looks horrible. An anxious zombie, especially in the dim glow of the lantern. Dark circles, from lack of sleep. Thin, from lack of food. Pale, from lack of sunlight. 
He places workman's gloves on his hands before picking up a can of Underwood chicken spread. With some degree of difficulty, he works the gloves beneath the tab and pulls. Careful not to cut himself, he reaches out and drops the lid into a small trash can. 
Alex removes the gloves and, with a plastic spoon, begins to eat. CAMERA PUSHES IN as he begins to chew methodically, chewing and chewing and chewing with concentration until... after steadying himself... prepares to swallow... then, carefully does.

THE DOOR 
Alex slams the door shut before it can open. Behind the door, a CRASH as something falls. Alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught Death before this attempt has brought to fruition. 
Alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. He cautiously opens the door, REVEALING an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. Removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor. 
CLOSET FLOOR 
a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor. Alex bends down and examines them.

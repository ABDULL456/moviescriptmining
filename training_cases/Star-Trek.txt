14   OMIT                                                               14 
15   OVER BLACKNESS, we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO. And then a 15 WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we... 
FADE IN: 
EXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK 
The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY, just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm water runs down its face and body. 
TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA: 
MIDWIFE He is strong. 
The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED.    He is then gently held out to the new MOTHER: 
AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized. She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly: 
AMANDA ... hello. 
CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room. She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks: 
YOUNGER MIDWIFE The baby is healthy. Why does she cry? 
MIDWIFE (a beat; then) She is human. 
A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time, that the Midwife has POINTED EARS. 
MIDWIFE (CONT'D) Sarek arrives. 
The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for a moment, clearly disquieted. 
15A   OMIT                                                              15A 
15B   EXT. VULCAN LANDSCAPE - DUSK [FORMER SC. 14]                      15B 
A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built seamlessly into a rocky mountainside. 
A SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06. 
The speeder parks outside the home -- 
15C   EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK                                           15C 
SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He looks at the child -- his child -- and says: 
SAREK Well done. 
She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just enough rancor: 
AMANDA Thanks. 
He regards her.   Knows he's in TROUBLE -- 
SAREK Your tone suggests disappointment. The Science Council required my presence for a session regarding-- 
AMANDA Don't do that.     You knew I wanted you here. 
The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods. The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says, clinically: 
SAREK As you are aware, the Vulcan male is traditionally not present at the moment of delivery. 
AMANDA Well traditionally, I'm not the one giving birth. (then) (MORE) 
15C   CONTINUED:                                                        15C AMANDA (CONT'D) I moved here -- to another planet -- to be with you. I needed you to be with me today. Holding my hand and telling me I'm doing great, even when I'm just... breathing the best I can. 
Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately: 
SAREK You are correct. I should have been here. I am sorry. 
And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses him. And the two look at the baby. 
SAREK (CONT'D) I had a thought. That we might name the child after one of our respected early society-builders. His name was "Spock". 
She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name. 
SAREK (CONT'D) Your silence does not suggest enormous enthusiasm. 
AMANDA No... Spock. (smiles, touches his face) ... Spock. 
She looks at Sarek: Spock it is. 
SAREK The child has your eyes. 
She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears.    She gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS, revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR. 
AMANDA ... and your ears. 
And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan, we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER "THREE YEARS LATER" APPEARS -- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON: 
15D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN [FORMER SC. 15A]                               15D 
With URGENCY, we MOVE DOWN a corridor with CAPTAIN ROBAU and OFFICER PITTS: 
CAPTAIN ROBAU                      OFFICER PITTS -- our sensors haven't made        -- no sir, it looked like a sense of the anomaly?              lightning storm in the middle -- how far are we from the         of space -- Klingon Neutral Zone?              -- 150,000 kilometers, but the vessel is not Klingon, Sir, its registry doesn't match any recorded profile -- 
SHWISH! The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks: 
CAPTAIN ROBAU Report. 
25A   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    25A 
Chief Engineer RUNS past us -- CONSUMED BY A SUDDEN EXPLOSION! 
25B   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                       25B 
A FEMALE CREW MEMBER running down the hall suddenly HOLDS ON as a HOLE IS RIPPED IN THE HALL -- and she's YANKED OUT OF THE CORRIDOR -- the CAMERA finally getting sucked out too! 
26    INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                          26 
-- PANDEMONIUM -- 
26    CONTINUED:                                                         26 
HELMSMAN                           OFFICER PITTS -- life support failing on           -- this is the U.S.S. Kelvin, decks seven through thirteen!        attemping to reach Starfleet We have confirmed casualties,        command on subspace! Repeat -- Sir!                                 U.S.S. Kelvin, under attack by unknown aggressor! 
FIRST OFFICER                      TACTICAL OFFICER -- shields at eleven percent         -- were our shields even up? and dropping! Ten percent --         That was like nothing I've we're at nine! Eight percent!        ever seen -- this ship can not Seven! We're dropping here!          take another hit like that! Six! 
CAPTAIN ROBAU All remaining power to forward shields! Prepare the shuttles f-- 
And he STOPS. They all do. A fucking FACE is now on their VIEWSCREEN. A ROMULAN FACE -- the FIRST OFFICER of the Narada, whom we'll come to know as AYEL: 
AYEL My commander requests the presence of your captain in order to negotiate a cease-fire. You will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal would be unwise. 
Screen goes DEAD. All eyes on Robau... and he feels them.      A tense, horrible moment. Finally, to the First Officer: 
CAPTAIN ROBAU Walk with me. 
The First Officer follows Robau OFF THE BRIDGE AND INTO: 
26A   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CORRIDORS - CONTINUOUS                        26A 
As they walk, briskly: 
CAPTAIN ROBAU If I don't report within fifteen minutes, execute general order 13. 
FIRST OFFICER Sir, we could issue a mayday call to-- 
CAPTAIN ROBAU (frightened, but firm) There is no help for us out here. If we're going down, we're taking them with us -- you save as many as you can. 
8A 26A   CONTINUED:                                                       26A 
FIRST OFFICER ... aye, Captain. 
Robau heads into a waiting TURBOLIFT, turns -- they lock eyes, knowing what this means. Finally: 
CAPTAIN ROBAU You're Captain now. Mr. Kirk. 
He's gone.   And we realize this is GEORGE KIRK, Jim's father. 
26B-C OMIT                                                         26B-C 
26D   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                        26D 
All eyes on Kirk as he enters -- moves to the captain's chair. Sits. Not a small moment. Speaking his first words as Captain: 
GEORGE KIRK Lieutenant Pitts. Transfer Robau's vital signs to the main view screen. 
OFFICER PITTS Yessir. 
In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors -- his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it. A LOW- PITCHED BEEPBEEP of his HEARTBEAT is now HEARD -- 
SCIENCE OFFICER Vitals on line. 
GEORGE KIRK (slightly awkward) -- thank you. 
26DA INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                    26DA 
TILT DOWN as the TURBO-LIFT DESCENDS -- we PUSH IN as the doors open and Captain Robau gets out -- moves quickly -- hurries down a SHUTTLE BAY catwalk -- 
26DB INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 26C]                       26DB 
Robau enters a shuttle -- LIGHTS BLINK to life.   He moves to the cockpit -- starts the vehicle up -- 
CAPTAIN ROBAU Computer, initiate departure sequence. 
A LOUD HISS and the craft SHUDDERS as it disembarks -- 
26DC INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         26DC 
Sparks dripping from the ceiling, everyone is motionless -- eyes on the monitors -- and we're TIGHT ON GEORGE KIRK -- the BEEPS of Robau's heart might as well be representing his own. He realizes he's sweating -- wipes his forehead as: 
OFFICER PITTS The shuttle's pulling out of main bay, Sir. 
GEORGE KIRK I want to see him -- floodlights please. 
26E   EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - SPACE                                     26E 
Two MASSIVE FLOODLIGHTS on the Kelvin's dish GO HOT -- and turn, FLARING out the lens -- landing on the SHUTTLE as it leaves the KELVIN, heading toward the imposing Narada. 
26EA INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                       26EA 
Backlit by the distant floodlights, Robau remains steely-eyed as he moves for the darkened ship -- nerves -- 
26F   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE                                    26F 
And Robau's HEARTBEAT QUICKENS -- the tension they all feel: 
OFFICER PITTS His heart rate's elevated-- 
HELMSMAN He's scared. 
GEORGE KIRK He's brave.    That's what he is. 
26FA INT. SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                                       26FA 
Robau watches as he gets closer, the BEEPBEEPING HEARD over the SOUNDS of the shuttle -- but then -- 
26FB EXT. NARADA - SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                26FB 
PUSH IN on him, his heart shattering -- having to out-maneuver incoming torpedoes, piloting the ship to its doom -- still, he forces optimism: 
GEORGE KIRK I'll see you in a minute, sweetheart. 
He disconnects -- another ALARM -- he TURNS the ship, FIRES -- 
26MA EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CONTINUOUS                                 26MA 
The Kelvin BANKS AGAIN -- its PHOTONS SLAMMING INTO THE ONCOMING NARADA TORPEDOES, JUST AVOIDING IMPACT! 
26N   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - SHUTTLE BAYS - CONTINUOUS                   26N 
CREW MEMBERS scramble to their shuttles as the ship TREMBLES -- and we find WINONA among them, being PUSHED through the madness. 
26P   INT. MED-EVAC SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                               26P 
The Med-Team ARRIVES with Winona in the wheelchair-- it's CHAOS - - and for Winona, a huge contraction -- 
WINONA -- Agh!   That was-- that was a big one! 
-- as they put her into the shuttle bed: 
NURSE Just keep breathing, Honey, you're gonna be just fine-- 
WINONA (through the pain) -- the baby, too, right? 
NURSE -- the baby too. 
26R   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         26R 
As George Kirk pilots, he checks the monitors -- one reads the COUNTDOWN TO SELF-DESTRUCT (180 SECONDS, 179 SECONDS, 178 SECONDS...) and another reads IMPACT PROXIMITY (36,054 METERS, 
26R   CONTINUED:                                                      26R 
Another screen that shows stats of DEPARTING SHUTTLES -- more leaving as we glance at the screen -- but SHUTTLE 34 REMAINS DOCKED -- 
The NARADA is GROWING in the viewscreen -- he hits the comlink: 
GEORGE KIRK Captain to shuttle 37 -- is my wife on board? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
26S   OMIT                                                            26S 
26T   INT. MED-EVAC SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                              26T 
The PILOT is readying the controls -- 
SHUTTLE PILOT Yessir, she is-- 
GEORGE KIRK I need you to go now, d'you hear me? 
SHUTTLE PILOT We're waiting for you, Sir-- 
GEORGE KIRK No-- go, take off, immediately. 
SHUTTLE PILOT ... yessir! 
Shuttle Pilot works the controls -- and Winona, in the back, feels the shuttle SHUDDER -- 
WINONA Wait! We can't go, my husband isn't here yet! Please! STOP--! 
-- but she's suddenly WINCING as another CONTRACTION hits -- 
NURSE You'll need to push now-- are you ready? 
26U   EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - SHUTTLE BAY - CONTINUOUS                   26U 
Clamps holding the shuttle SLAM BACK, the MED-SHUTTLE DROPS HARD, FUSION IMPULSE ENGINES IGNITE and the shuttle MOVES -- 
26V   OMIT                                                            26V 
26W   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                       26W 
George hits COMLINK -- a TONE -- then WINONA'S VOICE: 
WINONA The shuttle's leaving-- where are you? 
As George EVADES ENEMY FIRE, heading for the massive alien ship: 
GEORGE KIRK My love?   Listen carefully, okay? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
26X   INT. MED-EVAC SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS                             26X 
Winona, holding her communicator -- 
WINONA -- we're about to have this baby -- 
GEORGE KIRK Sweetheart... I'm not going to be able to be there. 
And she just stares -- realizing what's happening -- that he's been made Captain -- that there was an evacuation -- and somehow she just KNOWS. Tears come to her eyes -- 
WINONA -- no-- no, no-- wait-- 
GEORGE KIRK                           WINONA I want you to hear me. Please.                           Are you still on the ship? No- -- There's no other way-- my      - no, you need to be here-- love-- you know all I want--      -- George, I can't do this all I want in the world is to     without you-- be with you--                        (crying now) -- please -- don't d--! 
-- but she's WINCING AGAIN -- 
DOCTOR Okay-- you need to push. 
-- and she does -- the shuttle BANKS and -- 
26Y   EXT. U.S.S. KELVIN - CORRIDORS                                 26Y 
-- and the shuttle LEAVES the Kelvin bay -- turning to join DOZENS of other shuttles, all heading off in escape -- 
26Z   INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                         26Z 
SPOCK (CONT'D) May I ask a personal query? 
AMANDA ... anything. 
SPOCK Should I choose to complete the Vulcan discipline of Kolinahr... and purge all emotion... I trust you will not feel it reflects judgement upon you. 
She stares at him, moved.      Touches his face. 
AMANDA As always... whoever you choose to be... you will have a proud mother. 
HOLD on mother and son, worlds apart but forever bonded: 
58   INT. VULCAN SCIENCE ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBER - DAY                  58 
An imposing yet BEAUTIFUL INDOOR ATRIUM. Spock stands before the VULCAN HIGH COUNCIL. Among faces on the dais: his FATHER, seated beside the SCIENCE MINISTER and other VULCAN LEADERS. 
SCIENCE MINISTER You have surpassed the expectations of your instructors. Your final record is flawless. With one exception. I see you have applied to Starfleet as well. 
SPOCK It was logical to cultivate multiple options. 
SCIENCE MINISTER Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy. A distinction all the more significant given that you will be its first half- human pupil. It is truly remarkable, Spock. That you have achieved so much despite your disadvantage. Welcome to the Academy. 
They all start to rise.      But Spock is suddenly unsettled: 
SPOCK If you would clarify, Minister-- what "disadvantage" are you referring to? 
SCIENCE MINISTER ... your human mother. 
58   CONTINUED:                                                         58 
As the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat. His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life -- 
SPOCK Council -- ministers.    I must decline. 
Everyone STOPS.   A solid BEAT.   Confused looks turn cold: 
SCIENCE MINISTER No Vulcan has ever declined admission to this academy. 
SPOCK Then as I am half-human, your record remains untarnished. 
SAREK                               SPOCK Spock. You have made a commitment to honor the Vulcan       At the moment, Father, I can way--                                think of no greater way to honor our race than to attend Starfleet as its first Vulcan. 
SCIENCE MINISTER Why did you come before this council today? Was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel? 
SPOCK I came with the intention of enrolling, as my father wished. However, your "insight" has convinced me otherwise. Therefore, the only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration. (a contained "fuck you") Live long and prosper. 
He looks to his father, whose disappointment is evident -- still, God bless him, Spock walks out -- 
59   EXT. "THE WARP TRAIL" BAR - IOWA - NIGHT                              59 
-- PUSH DOWN A HALLWAY -- MUSIC HEARD -- what seems like a PARTY is going on through windows in the double-doors ahead -- and a WOMAN SWOOPS INTO VIEW in front of us -- we PUSH BEHIND HER in the short skirt and high boots as she ENTERS the place -- a local, busy BAR -- the woman makes her way to the BAR, and we see her GORGEOUS, DIGNIFIED FACE. THIS IS UHURA. She leans into the bartender warmly, her smile glorious: 
59   CONTINUED:                                                    59 
UHURA Hi. I'd like a Klabnian Fire Tea, two Cardassian Sunrises and three Earth beers, no slim-shots, anything on draft. 
VOICE (O.S.) That's a lot of drinks for one woman. Wearing those boots. 
JAMES KIRK'S FACE leans in: at 22, he's charming, witty, dangerous, rebellious. He grins at her, flirty. Uhura gives him a look, then back to the bartender: 
UHURA And a shot of Jack, straight up. 
KIRK (to the bartender) Make it two -- her shot's on me. 
UHURA Her shot's on her. Thanks but no thanks. 
KIRK Don't you want my name before you completely reject me? 
UHURA I'm good without it. 
Damn, he likes her already. 
KIRK You are good without it. It's Jim. Jim Kirk. (long beat) If you don't tell me your name, I'm gonna have to make one up. 
UHURA (beat) Uhura. 
KIRK Uhura? No way -- that's the name I was gonna make up for you. Uhura what? 
UHURA Just Uhura. 
KIRK They don't have last names in your world? 
59   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    59 
UHURA Uhura is my last name. 
KIRK They don't have first names in your world? Wait, let me guess. Is it "Jim"? 
That makes her smile.    So he moves closer to her: 
KIRK (CONT'D) Okay, so you're a cadet. Studying. What's your focus? 
UHURA Xenolinguistics. Lemme guess: you don't know what that means. 
KIRK Let me guess: study of Alien languages: phonology, morphology, syntax-- it means you've got a talented tongue. 
UHURA And for a moment I thought you were just a dumb hick who only has sex with farm animals. 
KIRK Well.    Not only. 
UHURA You think you're smart. 
KIRK Oh, baby, I'm the smartest. 
Something sad in that.    A BURLY STARFLEET CADET appears. 
BURLY CADET This guy bothering you? 
UHURA Beyond belief, but nothing I can't handle. 
KIRK (CONT'D) Four years?   I'm gonna do it in three. 
Pike grins as Kirk passes him. 
Inside the shuttle, Kirk moves down rows of new recruits, some of them ALIEN. Passes UHURA and the BARFIGHT CADETS, who PERK UP when they see him -- one has a BANDAGED HAND. 
64   CONTINUED:                                                      64 
KIRK (CONT'D) At ease, Gentlemen. (then, to Uhura) Never did get that first name. 
UHURA (can't help it: a grin) And you never will. 
He smiles as he takes a seat at the back of the shuttle.   Straps in as it RISES... 
MAN'S VOICE Are you people deaf? I told you I don't need a doctor, damnit! I AM A DOCTOR! 
Kirk turns to see a MAN being forced OUT of the BATHROOM by a FEMALE FLIGHT OFFICER -- at 34, he has a Southern lilt and looks like a prisoner waiting for the guillotine to fall: 
FLIGHT OFFICER                          MAN -- you need to find a seat --     -- I had one, in the bathroom, Darlin', with no windows -- -- Sir, for your own safety,      -- I suffer from Aviaphobia, siddown, or I will MAKE you       case you don't understand big sit down... do you hear me?       words, it means 'fear of dying RIGHT NOW.                        in something that flies.' 
They GLARE at each other, then the man drops into the seat beside Kirk. The ship TORQUES to one side and the man GRIPS his armrests, pale, sweating -- glances at Kirk: 
MAN I might throw up on you. 
KIRK I think these things're pretty safe-- 
MAN Don't pander to me, kid: one tiny crack in the hull and our blood boils in thirteen seconds -- solar flare might crop up, cook us in our seats -- Hell, some of the damn passengers are blue. And wait'll you're sitting pretty with a case of Andorian shingles, see if you're still so relaxed when your eyeballs are bleeding-- space is disease and danger, wrapped in darkness and silence. 
KIRK I hate to break this to you, but Starfleet operates in space. 
64    CONTINUED: (2)                                                   64 
MAN Yeah, well my ex-wife took the whole damn planet in the divorce, I got nowhere to go but up. Leonard McCoy. 
KIRK Jim Kirk-- you really gonna throw up--? 
MCCOY Maybe--

Nero lies on the floor of his cell, semi-conscious, looking like death. Behind him the DOOR OPENS. Two KLINGON GUARDS enter, backlit. 
KLINGON GUARD #1 The day you've been waiting for is upon us, Silent One. And look. No sign of salvation. No sign of change. Just more pain. 
And they both lift his limp body up -- as something miraculous happens -- NERO SNAPS TO LIFE AND SINGLE-HANDEDLY BEATS THE SHIT OUT OF THE GUARDS -- TAKING THEM BOTH DOWN IN TEN SECONDS -- in what seems like an instant, he's the only one standing here -- holding both of the Guards' rifles -- which he TWIRLS, badass. 
64G   INT. AYEL'S CELL - NIGHT                                         64G

NERO The wait is over. 
Off Ayel, we CUT TO: 
64H   EXT. STARFLEET ACADEMY GROUNDS - DAY   [FORMER SC. 82]         64H 
TILT DOWN from a GLIMMERING BUILDING TO REVEAL a sea of RED CADET UNIFORMS: HUNDREDS OF CADETS head across campus, McCoy and Kirk among them. A miraculous view of San Francisco beneath a blue sky, Golden Gate Bridge piercing the air. Kirk struts: 
KIRK So you'll do it for me, right? 
MCCOY I have no interest. 
KIRK I didn't ask if you have interest, I asked if you'd do it. 
MCCOY I'm about to ask you an obvious question: why bother? 
KIRK Because I've failed the test twice. 
MCCOY And you're determined to make it three. We've all failed it-- everyone has, and that's the point! No one goes back for seconds, let alone thirds -- it's not like you need to pass it to graduate. 
KIRK So Bones: why do they make us take it? 
MCCOY I told you to stop calling me that. You're very annoying. 
KIRK And you're the greatest -- thank you. 
MCCOY You'd better study for it this time. 
KIRK Oh, no-- Bones -- I gotta date. 
64H   CONTINUED:                                                         64H 
MCCOY A date? Listen, as smart as you are, which ain't much, if you don't prepare-- 
KIRK You have no idea how prepared I'm gonna be-- no idea. 
And with a smile, Kirk heads off -- McCoy watches him go, calling after him: 
MCCOY Seriously, stop calling me Bones! (to himself, hating it) "Bones". 
65-78 OMIT                                                           65-78

In MOONLIGHT, a beautiful WOMAN lies on her back, in some kind of bra, moaning in delight -- this is GAILA -- 
GAILA -- oh Jim... Jim... Jim, I love you. 
KIRK (kissing her) ... Yeah. I sent you a message. 
And we CONTINUE TO PULL BACK TO REVEAL that, sitting among the technicians, is Gaila. Our resident GREEN GIRL. She checks her watch -- PUSH IN ON IT: 2:59 PM. On her MONITOR awaits a 23rd century e-mail -- a MESSAGE FROM KIRK -- 
81C   INT. U.S.S. TRAINER - BRIDGE SIMULATOR - DAY    [FORMER SC. 67]    81C 
MCCOY Three more Klingon Warbirds decloaking -- and targeting our ship -- I don't suppose this is a problem either? 
KIRK Nah. 
WEAPONS OFFICER They're firing, Captain. 
KIRK Alert medical bay to prepare to receive all crew members from the damaged ship. 
UHURA And how do you expect us to rescue them when we're surrounded by Klingons? 
KIRK Alert medical. 
Annoyed, she does as: 
MCCOY Our ship is being hit -- shields at sixty percent. 
KIRK I understand. 
MCCOY Should we at least, I dunno, fire back? 
KIRK Mmmm... no. 
MCCOY Of course not. 
81D   INT. TESTING CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 70]           81D 
CLOSE ON GAILA'S WATCH as it changes to 3:00 -- and she   opens Jim's message -- and all it reads is, "I'M SORRY." And    just then something UPLOADS and EXECUTES and ALL THE SCREENS   IN HERE AND ON THE BRIDGE DIE -- THE SYSTEM CRASHES -- everyone   reacts -- 
TEST ADMINISTRATOR #1 -- the hell's happening?! 
81E   INT. U.S.S. TRAINER - BRIDGE SIMULATOR - CONTINUOUS [FRMR. 71]    81E 
The crew doesn't know what's up -- except Kirk, who is remarkably pleased -- when the LIGHTS AND MONITORS COME BACK ON, things are not the same: 
UHURA (perplexed, works controls) -- the Kobayashi Maru is still in distress... but... the Klingons have stopped firing. 
KIRK Arm photons. Prepare to fire on the Klingon warbirds. 
MCCOY Jim, their shields are up. 
KIRK Are they? 
McCoy looks at his monitor.   No they're not. 
MCCOY ... no. 
KIRK Fire on all enemy ships -- one photon each should do -- let's not waste ammunition. 
WEAPONS OFFICER Target lock acquired on all warbirds -- firing! 
They fire -- AND DESTROY ALL FIVE KLINGON SHIPS INSTANTLY.    All mouths here are agape. 
81E   CONTINUED:                                                         81E 
KIRK Begin rescue of the stranded crew. So. We've eliminated all enemy ships, no one on board was injured and the successful rescue of the Kobayashi Maru crew is underway. 
For the first time, Kirk looks up to the testing room windows: 
KIRK (CONT'D) Anything else? 
81F   INT. TESTING CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS [FORMER SC. 72]            81F 
And they're stunned up here, too -- Test Administrator #2 turns to someone OFF-CAMERA:

REVEAL who he was talking to: SPOCK is here.      And not happy. 
SPOCK ... I do not know.

83    INT. ACADEMY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY                                 83 
TIGHT ON a stern STARFLEET ACADEMY PRESIDENT: 
ACADEMY PRESIDENT James T. Kirk.     Step forward. 
It's a huge Starfleet chamber. Golden Gate Bridge visible through huge windows. 500 cadets, a nervous KIRK among them. He stands, moves to one of two PODIUMS. 
ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D) An incident has occurred today that concerns the entire student body. Academic immorality by one is an assault on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this council suggesting you violated the ethical code of conduct pursuant to regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code. Is there anything you care to say before we begin? 
KIRK (uncomfortable beat) Yessir. I believe I have the right to face my accuser directly. 
83   CONTINUED:                                                      83 
President nods toward the assembly. SPOCK RISES. He and Kirk MEET EYES for the first time. It's clock-stopping. 
ACADEMY PRESIDENT Step forward please. This is Commander Spock, one of our most distinguished graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru test for the last four years. 
Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM.      President nods. 
SPOCK Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub- routine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test. 
We happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed. 
KIRK Your point being? 
ACADEMY PRESIDENT In academic vernacular, you cheated. 
KIRK Respectfully.    Define "cheating". 
SPOCK To deceive by trickery. 
KIRK Now let me ask you something I think we all know the answer to: the test is rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to be unwinnable. 
SPOCK Yes, Lieutenant? 
UHURA Was I not one of your top students? 
SPOCK Indeed you were -- 
UHURA Did I not receive a Gold rating for Exolinguistic skills, giving Starfleet first place over Kyoto and MIT at the Oxford Invitational? 
A LOUD nearby SHUTTLE LEAVES BEHIND THEM -- it gets WINDY -- 
SPOCK An exceptional achievement, to be su--

UHURA -- and did I not, on multiple occasions, demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity and, I quote, "unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomalies" in subspace transmission tests?! 
SPOCK Consistently, yes-- 
UHURA And while you were well aware that my unqualified desire was to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned to the Farragut. 
Spock reacts unusually; he seems almost embarrassed.   Quiet. 
SPOCK It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism. 
She gets closer, voice low, all pride and defiance: 
UHURA No. No. I am assigned to the Enterprise. 
Their eyes hold.    He checks his tablet, makes an change: 
SPOCK Oh.     Yes, I believe you are. 
85   INT. SHUTTLE HANGAR MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS                      85 
McCoy and Kirk enter fast. McCoy goes through a cabinet, preps a med in a hypospray SYRINGE. 
KIRK What are you doing? 
MCCOY Doing you a favor. I couldn't just leave you there, looking all pitiful-- roll up your sleeve, I'm gonna give you a vaccine against viral infection from Melvaran mud fleas. 
McCoy FIRES the Hypospray -- 
85    CONTINUED:                                                          85 
KIRK                                MCCOY Ow-- what for?                      To give you symptoms. -- I don't understand--             -- you're gonna start to lose vision in your left eye -- -- yeah, I already have --          -- don't stand up yet -- (he tries to stand; WOOZY) -- what'd you do to me?             -- you're gonna get a really (in pain)                        bad headache. And flopsweat. -- this is a favor?!                -- yeah, you're welcome. 
McCoy ushers Kirk out of the room -- 
86    EXT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - HANGAR - CONTINUOUS                        86 
McCoy ushers Kirk to a shuttle -- a SCANNING OFFICER stops them: 
SCANNING OFFICER "Kirk, James T." -- he's not cleared for duty aboard the Enterprise -- 
MCCOY But I am, and Medical Code states the treatment and transport of a patient's to be determined at the discretion of his attending physician, which is me. (re: scanner) You can see he's suffering, he needs me as his doctor, so since I'm assigned to this ship, so's he, or would you like to explain to Captain Pike why the Enterprise warped into a crisis without one of its medical officers? 
SCANNING OFFICER ... as you were. 
MCCOY As you were. 
And with that, he pulls Kirk past the speechless officer -- 
86A   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY                                            86A

Kirk, in agony, sweating, sits beside McCoy as they pass through the stratosphere. McCoy's peering out a window -- 
KIRK I might throw up on you. 
87   CONTINUED:                                                        87

And through his pain, Kirk does... and is amazed... 
88   INT. STARBASE ONE - SPACE DOCK - CONTINUOUS                       88 
The shuttle approaches a massive DOCKING STATION where a dozen STARFLEET VESSELS ARE DOCKED. But the ship we're approaching is miraculous: "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701" IS REVEALED ON THE HULL OF THE FLAGSHIP. THE QUEEN OF THE FLEET IS FULLY CONSTRUCTED AND READY FOR HER MAIDEN VOYAGE. The shuttle glides to the underside of the Enterprise. A DOCKING BAY opens -- 
89   INT. ENTERPRISE SHUTTLE BAY WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS                  89 
Officers move quickly on the ship -- Kirk and McCoy enter.    Kirk WIPING HIS BROW, pretty much SOAKED. 
KIRK Bones. Thanks for getting me on board. But I don't feel right. I feel like I'm leaking. 
MCCOY Oh look, the pointy-eared bastard. 
Kirk looks up -- SPOCK moves towards them, not seeing them -- Kirk yanks McCoy out of the way -- Spock passes and enters a TURBOLIFT -- Kirk looks back as the doors close. 
Then we go INTO THE TURBOLIFT -- for just a moment -- as the doors open and we enter with Spock: 
90   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                             90 
Spock walks through the glorious, gleaming new space, taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE. PIKE at the command chair. 
SPOCK Captain, engineering reports "ready for launch". 
PIKE The maiden voyage of our newest flagship deserves more pomp and circumstance than we can afford today, but her christening will have to be our reward for a safe return-- (toggles intercom) All decks, this is Captain Pike. Prepare for immediate departure. Helm, thrusters.

CHEKOV'S FACE appears on monitors throughout the great ship, including ENGINEERING: CRANE DOWN 12 stories of catwalks as engineers tend to the DILITHIUM CRYSTAL CHAMBER that operates the warp drive -- 
CHEKOV ON SCREEN Soon after, Starfleet received a distress signal from the Vulcan High Council that their planet was experiencing seismic activity. We then lost contact with Vulcan entirely.

MEDICAL BAY: as the med staff sets up a triage area -- 
CHEKOV ON SCREEN (CONT'D) We should be arriving at Vulcan within two minutes. Thank you for your time. 
And as Chekov's message ends, Kirk suddenly SITS UP IN FRAME -- his mind SPINNING, through the pain and sedative -- he tries to get off the bed, to his feet, as McCoy hurries over -- 
MCCOY Jim, I told you to stay d-- good God! 
What McCoy has just seen -- what we and Kirk see now -- is that KIRK'S HANDS HAVE SWOLLEN TO ALMOST TWO TIMES THEIR NORMAL SIZE. 
KIRK -- what's this?! 
MCCOY -- I don't know-- a reaction to the vaccine -- damnit -- 
Kirk rushes to the video monitor where Chekov was seen -- using his huge hands, he REWINDS CHEKOV'S SPEECH -- replays this part as McCoy SCANS KIRK WITH A HANDHELD DIAGNOSER -- 
CHEKOV ON SCREEN -- telemetry detected an anomaly in the Neutral Zone. What appeared to be a lightning storm in space. 
He FREEZES it -- eyes wild -- looks to McCoy -- 
KIRK -- Bones -- we have to stop the ship-- 
MCCOY -- you're not allergic to Cardassian vole dander, are you? 
KIRK --- what? How the hell would I know?     Is Uhura on board?

MCCOY I haven't seen a reaction this severe since Med school. 
A MAP appears -- locates her --

Kirk and McCoy enter -- Kirk stops, looks around -- 
MCCOY Come here -- Jim -- don't move -- 
And McCoy INJECTS HIM WITH ANOTHER SHOT -- 
KIRK -- ow!   Stop it! 
And Kirk runs into a ENORMOUS SPACE -- giant STEEL COLLECTOR TANKS surround a dozen workstations where CREW MEMBERS collect data -- Kirk races to Uhura -- 
KIRK (CONT'D) The transmission from the Klingon prison planet -- what exactly did you hear? 
UHURA What are you doing here-- what happened to your hands?!

KIRK Who was it who escaped? What was the ship that was stolen--?! (to McCoy, indiscernible) -- what's happening to my mouth? 
MCCOY (working Hypospray) -- you've got Numb Tongue -- 
KIRK (impossible to make out) Numb tongue? 
MCCOY That's not good-- I can fix that-- 
Kirk grabs a pen with his huge hands and writes -- shows her what he's written: "THE SHIP - WAS IT ROMULAN?" Uhura looks at him -- somehow scared -- as McCoy INJECTS HIM AGAIN:

PIKE You've declared war against the Federation. Withdraw, and I'll agree to arrange a conference with Romulan leadership at a neutral loca-- 
NERO I do not speak for the Empire. We stand apart. As does your Vulcan crew member... isn't that right? Spock? 
All eyes on Spock.   Spock looks to Pike, who nods permission: 
SPOCK (to Nero) Pardon me. But I don't believe you and I are acquainted. 
NERO ... no, we're not. Not yet. (then) I would like you to see something. Spock. (then) Captain Pike-- your transporter capability is disabled. You will man a shuttle and come aboard the Narada for negotiations. That is all.

PIKE Without transporters, we can't beam off the ship, can't assist Vulcan, can't do our job. I'm creating an opportunity: Mr. Kirk, Mr. Sulu and Mr. Olson will space-jump from the shuttle. You'll have chutes -- you'll land on that machine they've lowered into the atmosphere that's scrambling our gear-- you'll get inside, disable that thing then beam back to the ship. 
Kirk and Sulu share a HOLY FUCKING SHIT look -- 
KIRK ... okay.

PIKE It's not a prank, Spock.   And I'm not the Captain. You are. 
And with that, he's DONE. Strides off.     Kirk finally shakes off the shock of his PROMOTION -- 
Kirk SPINS just as a Romulan appears -- tackling Kirk to the drill platform! The two FIGHT PRECARIOUSLY ON THE EDGE OF THE SWIRLING PLASMA DRILL, WIND ROARING -- and suddenly there's ANOTHER ROMULAN from an OPEN HATCH! SULU SLIDES DOWN THE CABLE - - JUMPING and tackling the second guard and the shit is ON: our Starfleet heroes battling these Romulans to the death -- and Sulu KICKS OFF AN ANTENNA PIECE and uses it as a SABER -- fucking swashbuckling at 10,000 feet! It's a frenzied assault even the bigger Romulan isn't ready for, and Sulu manages to KICK him into the vortex, where he's VAPORIZED as -- 
KIRK draws his PHASER and point-blank SHOOTS the Romulan, knocking him clear OFF the cylinder and into the sky, falling to his death, DISINTEGRATING as he falls -- 
Against pummeling wind, Kirk and Sulu move toward the HATCH -- OPEN IT -- as: 
125   OMIT                                                             125

Pike's SHUTTLE DOOR OPENS. Pike steps out. Surrounded by a dozen of Nero's men. Ayel steps forward. Pike stands firm, knowing this is the end for him: 
PIKE I'm Captain Christopher Pi-- 
WHACK! He's cut off by a PUNCH to the face. Drops to his knees. Looks up at Ayel with blazing eyes, wipes a trickle of blood from his lip: 
PIKE (CONT'D) So much for diplomacy. 
He's DRAGGED AWAY as -- 
127   INT. PLASMA DRILL CYLINDER - CONTINUOUS                         127 
Kirk and Sulu DROP IN through the outer hatch to find a control console, Sulu madly flips switches, no luck -- 
SULU None of this is familiar-- the interface, the controls-- 
KIRK                              SULU Step back--                       -- what, you have an idea? -- yeahyeah, I do-- 
Kirk FIRES his PHASER at the console, BLASTING IT --

CHEKOV Transporter control re-engaged -- 
Spock looks up from his console, grave --

Nero, mind racing -- 
NERO Launch the red matter. Now.

Kirk and Sulu pull themselves from the control cockpit back out onto the drill's outer hull, they start to hear a SOUND... A HIGH-PITCHED SHRIEK... GETTING LOUDER AS IT FALLS TOWARD THEM... THEY LOOK UP JUST IN TIME TO SEE: THE RED MATTER POD RIP RIGHT PAST THEM -- SNAP-TILT DOWN WITH IT AS IT PLUMMETS TOWARD VULCAN'S SURFACE, DISAPPEARING INTO THE DRILLED GAPING HOLE -- 
And for an instant... nothing. What looks like a puff of smoke billowing up from the planet's core... THEN A SHOCKWAVE BLASTS UPWARD, ALL THE WAY UP TO THE DRILL AT 10,000 FEET -- KIRK AND SULU FEEL IT -- LOSE THEIR BALANCE, FIGHT FOR PURCHASE AS: 
KIRK Kirk to Enterprise -- they just launched something toward the planet!

CHEKOV Keptin: gravitational sensors are off the scale -- if my calculations are correct, that pod they launched is creating a singularity... that will consume the planet. 
SPOCK'S STOIC FACE. WE GET ONLY A HINT OF THE WILD EMOTIONS STIRRING INSIDE HIM -- Uhura watches Spock, heartsick for him: 
SPOCK They're creating a black hole... at the center of Vulcan? 
CHEKOV ... yessir. 
SPOCK How long does the planet have? 
CHEKOV ... minutes, Sir. I'd say minutes. 
SPOCK (beat, to Uhura) Alert Vulcan Command Center to signal a planetwide evacuation-- all channels, all frequencies -- maintain standard orbit -- 
UHURA What?   Spock, wait -- 
She goes after him as he moves to the TURBOLIFT -- 
UHURA (CONT'D) -- where are you going? 
SPOCK To evacuate the Vulcan High Council-- they're tasked with protecting our cultural history. My parents will be among them-- 
UHURA -- you can't beam them out? 
SPOCK It's not possible -- they'll be in the Katrik Arc, I must get them myself--

PUSH IN as Spock MATERIALIZES -- the distant landscape around him COLLAPSING, IMPLODING, EXPLODING -- he sprints for the MOUNTAIN -- the entrance to the ARK -- a scared, small CREATURE runs past Spock as he heads up the mountain -- rocks falling -- 
143   INT. KATRIC ARK CHAMBER - DAY                                   143 
Spock RACES through the tunnels as the world SHAKES around him -- he enters the massive ARK CHAMBER -- sees, atop the enormous stairs, FIVE VULCAN ELDERS, Sarek among them, hands placed on the sarcophagus-like ark. Mind melding with it. Amanda is here too, kneeling beside Sarek -- and she sees her son, who is now RUNNING toward them -- she stands: 
AMANDA Spock--! 
Spock rushes up the stairs -- 
SPOCK The planet's not safe, it has only seconds left -- we must evacuate now -- 
And as they run out, ENORMOUS ROCKS COLLAPSE AROUND THEM -- and they run through the tunnels, the STONE COLLAPSING AROUND THEM -- 
144   EXT. TUNNEL ENTRANCE - DAY                                      144 
Spock and the group finally emerge from the tunnels to see -- THE PLANET IS COLLAPSING, COMING TOWARD THEM -- Spock whips open a tri-corder, TREMBLING LIKE CRAZY --

HORROR AS THE WORLD LITERALLY STARTS TO FALL APART AROUND SPOCK, HIS PARENTS AND THE FIVE ELDERS -- MASSIVE SINKHOLES APPEARING, LIKE THE GRAND CANYON RACING FOR THEM -- AND WE SEE IN ALL THEIR FACES -- THE BELIEF THAT THEIR PLANET -- THAT THEY -- ARE GOING TO DIE -- and Spock, trying to hold it together -- even though their transport hasn't yet begun -- looks at Amanda -- their eyes lock -- THE COLLAPSING GROUND RACING TOWARD THEM -- and in a surreal, intimate moment, Amanda says to Spock, quietly: 
AMANDA It's okay.   To be scared. 
146   CONTINUED:                                                     146 
PUSH IN ON SPOCK, looking at her -- as the LIGHT DARTS start TRACING THEM -- and they begin to EVAPORATE AS THE GROUND DROPS FROM UNDER AMANDA -- AND SHE'S SUCKED DOWN -- AWAY -- as Spock REACHES FOR HER, CALLING OUT -- 
SPOCK MOTHER!!!! 
147   INT. ENTERPRISE - TRANSPORTER BAY - CONTINUOUS                   147 
Chekov in a panic at the controls -- 
CHEKOV NO!!!   I'M LOSING HER!!! 
-- as the Vulcans MATERIALIZE on the pad, Spock still REACHING for his mother -- but all he gets it the GHOSTLY IMAGE OF HER -- BEAUTIFUL, HOLDING, FROZEN IN SPACE -- AN IMAGE HE'LL BE HAUNTED BY FOREVER -- AS IT FADES AWAY, EVANESCING LIKE MIST -- ON SPOCK as it lands -- Sarek too... a mother... a wife... has been lost. And Kirk stands nearby, having observed all of this, without anything to do or say... there's no cheating death. 
148   EXT. SPACE - ETERNAL NIGHT                                       148 
And the Enterprise BLASTS AWAY -- in the distance, THE ENTIRE PLANET OF VULCAN SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF -- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION -- UNTIL NOTHING IS THERE BUT DARKNESS. And over this we HEAR: 
SPOCK (V.O.) Acting Captain's log. Stardate 2256.42: I have assumed command of the Enterprise. 
149-50 MIT O                                                           149-50 
151   INT. ENTERPRISE - SICK BAY - CONTINUOUS                          151 
SHOCK. The kind that crashes after the world's changed. In triage, the bay's filled with wounded Enterprise Officers. The Vulcan Elders and Sarek being examined as well. Kirk sits here, getting his hand bandaged from the fight. During this, he looks up, seeing one of the Elders being treated for a slight wound -- her GREEN BLOOD seen through the bandage... 
SPOCK (V.O.) We've heard no word from Captain Pike. I have therefore classified him a hostage of the war criminal known as Nero. 
151A INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE                                          151A 
Spock sits in the captain's chair, reporting. He's glassy-eyed, staring at nothing as he speaks. Behind him, Uhura sits, watching, concerned. 
SPOCK Nero, who has destroyed my home planet. And most of its six billion inhabitants. I estimate no more than ten thousand survived. (beat) While the essence of our culture has been saved, in the elders who now reside upon this ship... I am now a member of an endangered species. 
Spock considers this. Clicks off the log recorder.     Spock moves off, into the turbolift -- Uhura follows him -- 
152   INT. TURBOLIFT - CONTINUOUS                                      152 
Spock and Uhura. Silence hangs. She glances over, wanting to say so much, but not to invade what must be the worst moment of his life. He looks at her, with kind eyes. And Uhura does something odd -- she STOPS the lift. Spock looks over as she wordlessly reaches out and puts her arms around him. Just holding him. Kissing his face with utter tenderness and comfort, which he lets her do... and we realize, this is why the intimacy before -- this is their secret... 
UHURA I'm so sorry. 
Spock looks off, taking comfort, bewildered and lost... 
UHURA (CONT'D) What can I do?     Tell me what you need. 
SPOCK ... I need... 
He's on the verge of some emotional release... but self- consciousness returns and he clamps up, starting the lift again: 
SPOCK (CONT'D) I need for us all to continue performing admirably. 
He looks at her again -- gives her another kiss. The door opens and he exits. She watches him go -- and the door closes on her. 
152A INT. ENTERPRISE - CORRIDOR                                        152A 
Kirk comes down the hall, stretching his hand bandage -- when he stops. Standing at the other end of the corridor, operating a DATAPAD is a familiar-looking GREEN GIRL. Guilt overcomes him. After a beat he moves to her. Awkward. 
KIRK Hey. (she turns to him) Listen, about what happened at Starfleet. The test and everything-- I know it looks like I was... using you, or whatever. And I'm sorry. I really am. And... I just hope you'll forgive me. 
She just stares at him for a long beat, as if she's just pissed. But Kirk's face changes... and then he says: 
KIRK (CONT'D) ... you're not Gaila, are you? 
NOT GAILA (pissed) No. 
KIRK (nods) Sorry. 
And he walks off.   (NOTE: ALT. VERSION HAS GAILA SAYING, "I'M NOT GAILA.") 
153   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                            153 
Uhura at her station, scanning for enemy signals -- all of our principals are here, in debate: 
SPOCK Lieutenant, have you confirmed that Nero is headed for Earth? 
Nero reaches for something under the counter Pike lies upon. Retrieves A FAMILIAR GLASS CONTAINER -- inside -- DOZENS OF CENTAURIAN SLUGS, the very ones used on Nero. 
NERO It's not the fault of the human race that Starfleet chose Earth as its center. You're a more noble race than my fallen cousins. I'll take no pleasure in your extinction. 
PIKE How reassuring. 
Nero opens the container, reaches for a pair of TONGS 
NERO The frequencies, please. 
PIKE Christopher Pike -- Captain, U.S.S. Enterprise, registry NCC-1701. 
Nero sad-smiles.   What he expected. 
154   CONTINUED: (4)                                                 154

Our POV is BLURRY. We come into FOCUS on a blinking instrument panel. KIRK is stirring awake, his shoulder kills. He sits up: inside a ONE-MAN POD CRAFT. He WIPES THE GLASS -- looks up -- like a TUNNEL OF SNOW, 30 feet long, to the sky. THE PODCRAFT'S EMBEDDED ON THE SURFACE OF A VAST, ICE PLANET. Kirk's been MAROONED. He closes his eyes, his face falls... 
KIRK Computer...    where am I? 
COMPUTER VOICE Current location Delta Vega: Class "M" Planet, unsafe. You have been ordered to remain in your pod until retrieved by Starfleet authorities. 
KIRK Bite me, how's that. 
The CANOPY RISES -- a blast of cold air hits Kirk -- with some agony, out he goes -- he CLIMBS UP THE TUBE OF SNOW -- and gets to the surface -- looks out. HE'S IN THE MIDDLE OF FUCKING NOWHERE. Finally: 
KIRK (CONT'D) SONOFABITCH-BITCH-BITCH! THERE'S NOTHING HERE!!! YOU NECK-PINCHING MOTHERF--!!!

Kirk FREEZES at a nearby GROWL. He looks -- sees nothing -- then ANOTHER GROWL -- he turns -- some thirty feet away, an eleven foot-tall cross between a polar bear and a gorilla (it's a POLARILLA) steps out from behind a mass of ice. Sees Kirk. It's horrifying. Kirk takes a SLOW, SMALL STEP BACKWARD -- and the fucking thing CHARGES HIM -- KIRK RUNS, TERRIFIED -- and the POLARILLA PURSUES -- gaining -- it's gonna EAT HIM ALIVE WHEN SUDDENLY -- 
WHATEVER WAS BENEATH THE ICE EARLIER EXPLODES UP THROUGH IT -- IT'S NEARLY 30 FEET TALL, RED, HUNDREDS OF EYES -- IT SMACKS THE POLARILLA AWAY LIKE NOTHING AS KIRK FALLS TO THE ICE AND TURNS BACK -- HOLY SHIT! THIS THING IS SO MUCH WORSE! IT ROARS AS KIRK GETS TO HIS FEET AND RUNS, SCREAMING -- 
KIRK HAULS ASS AS THE THING COMES AFTER HIM -- THEN SUDDENLY HE FALLS -- DROPS -- and we see that Kirk is FALLING DOWN A MASSIVE SNOW MOUNTAIN! The huge red creature stops at the edge and ROARS LOUDLY -- until the ice shelf BREAKS AWAY! The creature starts to FALL AS WELL! Now Kirk is TUMBLING, the immense creature TUMBLING not far behind! 
And Kirk LANDS ON THE ICE, HARD -- sees a distant CAVE. Looks up at the FLAILING CREATURE that is about to CRUSH HIM -- Kirk tries to run, but the ice is TOO SLIPPERY -- FINALLY he gets footing and runs off toward the cave -- as the red creature LANDS HARD -- its sharp SPEAR LIMBS STAB into the ice as it pursues Kirk --

Kirk races through the darkened cave -- the creature comes after him -- Kirk goes as fast as he can -- the creature reaches out and fucking GRABS HIM -- pulls him toward the disgusting, wet, TEETHY MOUTH -- Kirk tries to hold on to anything he can -- but he's fucking LUNCH -- and just as you're SCREAMING, there's LIGHT -- FIRE LIGHT -- and a FIGURE APPEARS, WAVING A TORCH -- 
And the red creature's eyes ALL GO WILD -- and it DROPS KIRK and BACKS OFF, AFRAID -- the figure CHASES IT until it's gone. Kirk, on the ground, is freaked out, out of breath, and can't take his eyes off this man... who says: 
160   CONTINUED:                                                     160

And the Figure turns... we may have recognized the voice. IT'S SPOCK. As in NIMOY. HERE. Lit in the darkness by the fire. We'll refer to him as SPOCK PRIME. He looks at Kirk -- moves closer to him -- finally seeing him. And is amazed... 
KIRK Hey... thank you... 
SPOCK PRIME ... Jim? 
KIRK (stunned) -- how d'you know my name? 
SPOCK PRIME How did you find me--? Does Starfleet know of my presence? 
KIRK HOW DO YOU KNOW MY NAME? 
Spock looks deep into the eyes of the freaked out young man, feeling the full effect of fate playing its hand, but realizing he doesn't recognize him... 
SPOCK PRIME I have been... and always shall be... your friend. 
KIRK -- no, I don't know you -- the only Vulcan I know isn't exactly a buddy. 
Of all the things Spock predicted Kirk might say, it wasn't that. He's analyzing a thousand steps ahead, calculating: 
SPOCK PRIME You are James T. Kirk. Your father is George, as is your brother. Your mother's name is Winona -- you were born in 2233 -- 
KIRK Stop.   Please.     I don't understand. 
As Spock nods, we PRE-LAP:

Firelight flickers -- shadows of Kirk and Spock Prime dance on the ice walls. Remarkable NIGHT STARS outside. 
SPOCK PRIME It's remarkably pleasing to see you again. (re: Vulcan) ... especially after the events of today. 
Spock Prime watches as the NARADA GOES IN -- LIGHTNING STORM- STYLE DISAPPEARING FIRST -- then SPOCK PRIME'S FACE -- WHITE WITH LIGHTNING -- OVEREXPOSED -- 
SPOCK PRIME (V.O.) Nero simply got to it first. How long I was travelling... I couldn't tell you. It was timeless. But when I arrived...

KIRK INHALES, SHARPLY, having been there with Spock Prime.    Back to the two men, in a cave: 
Kirk stares at him... his mind spinning because now he believes him. The result is overwhelmingly emotional. 
SPOCK PRIME Forgive me... emotional transference is an effect of the mind meld. 
174   CONTINUED:                                                    174 
KIRK (sympathy, surprise) ... so you do feel... 
SPOCK PRIME "Cthia" is the stricture that binds our emotions... but few of us are that perfectly Vulcan. 
Kirk gathers himself, wipes his eyes on his sleeve... 
KIRK Going back in time... you changed all our lives. 
SPOCK PRIME Yet remarkably, events within our timelines, characteristics, people... seem to overlap significantly. Tell me about the rest of the crew? Chekov-- Uhura --? 
KIRK Tactical and Communications -- 
SPOCK PRIME -- Sulu -- 
KIRK -- he's the helmsman, why? 
SPOCK PRIME Dr. McCoy would assert our meeting here is not a matter of coincidence... but rather, indication of a higher purpose. 
KIRK ... he'd call it a damn miracle. 
SPOCK PRIME Yes he would. Perhaps the time stream's way of attempting to mend itself. In both our histories, the same crew found its way onto the same ship in a time of ultimate crisis -- therein lies our advantage. (rises) We must go-- there's a Starfleet outpost not far from here. 
But Kirk stands -- stops him: 
174   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 174 
KIRK Where you came from... did I know my father? 
SPOCK PRIME ... yes. You often spoke of him as your inspiration for joining starfleet. 
This is amazing for Kirk -- he looks off, trying to imagine that life. Spock intuits what this means. 
SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D) You should know. He proudly lived to see you become captain of the Enterprise. 
KIRK ... Captain? 
SPOCK PRIME A ship we must return you to as soon as possible.

The turbolift opens -- McCoy enters, moves to Spock: 
MCCOY You wanted to see me? 
SPOCK (discreet tone) Yes, Doctor. I'm aware that James Kirk is a friend of yours. Supporting me, as you did, must have been difficult. 
MCCOY ... are you thanking me? 
SPOCK I'm simply acknowledging your difficulties. 
We're not sure how McCoy is taking this... 
174B CONTINUED:                                                       174B 
MCCOY Permission to speak freely, Sir. 
SPOCK I welcome it. 
MCCOY Do you. Okay then: are you out of your Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical thing? Maybe. The right one? Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure -- that kid doesn't know how to lose. Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize stallion in the stable." 
SPOCK ... a curious metaphor, Doctor. As a stallion must first be broken before it can reach its potential. 
MCCOY My God, Man... you could at least act like it was a hard decision. 
SPOCK I intended to assist in the effort to re- establish communication with Starfleet. However, if crew morale would be better served by my roaming the halls weeping, I'll gladly defer to your medical expertise. 
A strong look and Spock turns away as Sarek enters the bridge. Spock moves to meet him. Off McCoy, fuming -- 
174C EXT. DELTA VEGA - PLANET SURFACE - DAY                           174C 
A fucking BLIZZARD.   Kirk and Spock Prime move through the maddening whiteout.   Kirk yells through it: 
KIRK I AM SO PISSED OFF AT THE OTHER YOU RIGHT NOW! 
And Spock POINTS -- an OUTPOST -- half a mile away. 
177   CONTINUED: (2)                                                  177 
As Spock works the keyboard, an ENTERPRISE SCHEMATIC rotates: 
SPOCK PRIME Agreed: the aft engineering bay is your best option: a large space and no unpredictable airlocks -- 
KIRK -- you're coming with us, right? 
SPOCK PRIME No, Jim. My destiny lies along a different path. 
KIRK                          SPOCK PRIME Your destiny can wait -- he         (simply, strong) won't believe me, only you can   Under no circumstances can he explain w--                      be made aware of my existence. You must promise me this. 
KIRK You're telling me I can't tell you I'm following your own orders? Why not? What happens? 
SPOCK PRIME Trust me. Above all. Jim, this is the one rule you cannot break. To stop Nero, you alone must take command of your ship. 
KIRK How, over your dead body? 
SPOCK PRIME Preferably not. There is, however, Starfleet Regulation 619. (off Kirk's confusion) Yes. I forget what little regard you had for such things. 619 states that any commanding officer who is emotionally compromised by the mission at hand... must resign said command. 
KIRK So I need to emotionally compromise you? 
SPOCK PRIME Jim.  I just lost my planet. I can tell you.  I am emotionally compromised. (then) What you must do... is get me to show it. 
PUSHING IN ON KIRK as this lands for him -- 
177   CONTINUED: (3)                                                  177 
KIRK Hm. 
SCOTTY Aye, then. Live or die, Laddie, let's get this over with. he Enterprise has a decent cafeteria I'm guessing. 
Scotty's on the pad.   Kirk follows, looks at Spock: 
KIRK You know... coming back in time... changing history... that's cheating. 
SPOCK PRIME A trick I learned from an old friend. 
Something strikes Kirk -- his eyes GLINT with revelation. Spock responds enigmatically: a silent acknowledgment of what Kirk must do to get the ship. He raises his hand in the legendary Vulcan salute: 
SPOCK PRIME (CONT'D) Live long, and prosper. 
And Spock activates the transporter and they DEMATERIALIZE -- the light plays off his face as he watches them vanish -- 
178   EXT. SPACE - CONTINUOUS                                         178 
The Enterprise SHOOTS THROUGH FRAME at warp -- 
179   INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING BAY - CONTINUOUS                  179 
Amid the ROAR of the ship's plasma drives, PARTICLES rematerialize... it's KIRK, eyes wide in suspense. He looks down at his legs, his chest, his arms to make sure he's still in one piece, glances over to share his relief with Scotty... BUT SCOTTY ISN'T THERE. A strange BANGING -- Kirk turns: the BANGING is coming from a large metal TANK -- then Scotty appears in a TRANSLUCENT PIPE -- FREAKING OUT -- BANGING ON THE CLEAR METAL -- Kirk's mind races -- he looks around for a way to save his new friend -- just then a STRONG CURRENT IS FELT inside the tube -- AND SCOTTY IS YANKED AWAY, DOWN THE TUBE! 
KIRK -- no-- shit! 
And Kirk runs after him -- down the length of the ORANGE, TWISTING and TURNING tubes -- SCOTTY SEEN every time he enters a CLEAR TUBE AREA -- then DISAPPEARING again into the ORANGE tubes -- and Scotty gets sucked UPWARDS -- and Kirk turns and looks -- FOLLOWS THE LENGTH OF TUBE -- SEEING WHERE IT'S HEADING -- TO A GIANT WATER TURBINE -- essentially? A MASSIVE FUCKING BLENDER. 
179   CONTINUED:                                                        179 
KIRK (CONT'D) -- no--nonono-- 
And Kirk HAULS ASS to the control panel -- we see the huge machine -- overhead, the RELEASE VALVE under the pipe -- and Kirk works as fast as he can -- 
KIRK (CONT'D) COMEONCOMEONCOMEON -- like the simulator: manual control enabled, pressure seal: enabled -- shutdown-- 
-- but the COMPUTER SAYS: 
COMPUTER VOICE Turbine Shutdown Not Allowed. 
KIRK DAMNIT! 
180   INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS                             180 
A display on the forward console, an ALARM FLASHES -- 
CHEKOV Keptin, we're detecting unauthorized access to a water turbine control board! 
Spock moves from Sarek to Chekov -- 
SPOCK Bring up video. 
Chekov brings up TWO DOZEN SECURITY VIDEO IMAGES ON ONE SCREEN. Spock points to one -- it ENLARGES -- and we see KIRK AND SCOTTY racing through the ship -- Spock's eyes narrow -- he moves to the Captain's chair -- hits comm: 
SPOCK (CONT'D) Security, this is the captain -- seal engineering deck and bring me the intruders in turbine station three -- set phasers to stun. 
181   INT. PIPE - CONTINUOUS                                            181

181A INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING BAY - CONTINUOUS                   181A 
Kirk, AT THE PANEL, accesses the RELEASE VALVE CONTROL -- he watches Scotty disappear through a CLEAR SECTION -- Kirk times it -- waiting -- then he HITS THE BUTTON and Scotty DROPS THROUGH THE RELEASE VALVE AND SLAMS TO THE FLOOR -- hurt, wet, but BREATHING, deeply -- 
KIRK You all right? 
SCOTTY (recovering, looking around) -- nice -- (cough) -- ship. Really. 
KIRK -- let's get to the bridge-- 
181B INT. ENTERPRISE - VARIOUS AREAS                                  181B 
Kirk and wet Scotty race through the ship -- only to finally turn a corner and be faced with PHASERS, AIMED RIGHT AT THEM. 
But suddenly PHASERS are at their heads. Two SECURITY GUARDS -- one, THE GUY HE GOT INTO THE FIGHT WITH AT THE BAR, YEARS AGO. 
SECURITY OFFICER #1 Come with me.     Moon Beam. 
Off Kirk -- shit -- 
182-3 OMIT                                                        182-3 
SPOCK I have no comment on the matter. 
Kirk still stunned as Scotty moves to transporter control. 
SCOTTY If there's any common sense to their ship design, I'll be puttin' ya in a cargo bay, shouldn't be a soul in sight. 
KIRK AND SPOCK STAND ON THE TRANSPORTER PAD, SIDE-BY-SIDE AND FACING THE SAME DIRECTION FOR THE FIRST TIME -- AN ICONIC IMAGE - - The moment of truth. 
KIRK Energize. 
Scotty hits the transport and Kirk and Spock DISAPPEAR -- 
199   INT. NARADA - CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS                               199 
Kirk and Spock MATERIALIZE in the cargo bay... to find themselves suddenly smack-dab in the middle of SIX ROMULAN GUARDS working at cargo consoles!! 
199   CONTINUED:                                                        199 
For a split second they're as shocked as Kirk and Spock, until they ATTACK -- Kirk immediately engages the closest Romulan, struggles -- but Spock's a machine: his palm snaps up CRACKING a nose -- SLAMS a head against the wall -- as battle-ready as the Romulans are, it's like trying to catch a GHOST, Kirk finally knocks his one opponent unconscious, and turns to see it's ALL OVER -- 
KIRK (a touch insecure) Mine had a gun. 
SPOCK I am trained in the Vulcan martial art of Suus Mahna. 
Kirk and Spock move to a still conscious Romulan as he struggles to get up. Spock reaches for the fallen Romulan's temples. 
SPOCK (CONT'D) I am unable to meld with these Romulans -- there are subtle differences in their physiology I did not anticipate -- 
KIRK                                SPOCK -- punch him in the face -- make him talk! Suus Mahna his       -- Suss Mahna is only intended ass!                                for self-defense, he's no longer a threat -- -- then pretend it's a threat - - I'm your captain, that's an order! 
Spock PUNCHES the Romulan HARD -- and via Uhura's comlink translator, speaks in SUBTITLED ROMULAN: 
SPOCK (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D) What is your computer access code? 
The guard SPITS green blood at Spock, who PUNCHES him again -- 
SPOCK (SUBTITLE) (CONT'D) TELL! (PUNCH)    ME! (PUNCH) THE! (PUNCH) CODE!

A ROTATING SHIP SCHEMATIC -- Spock typing at a console, searching -- accesses two inter-cam windows: on one, SPOCK PRIME'S SHIP, THE JELLYFISH -- in a lower containment hold -- on the other: PIKE, unclear if he's dead or alive. 
SPOCK What you refer to as the "Red Matter Device" is in the main hangar -- and I've located Captain Pike. 
KIRK Is he alive? 
SPOCK Unknown. 
KIRK Let's move. 
They cover each other with phasers as they move down the hall --

Kirk hits a console, a familiar voice comes to life: 
COMPUTER VOICE Voice print and face recognition analysis enabled. 
KIRK Spock, you'll be piloting the ship alone. 
SPOCK Which may be problematic, as I am unfamiliar with this ship's design. 
THE LASER GRID RESPONDS TO SPOCK'S VOICE, scans his features for ID -- THE HOLOGRAPHIC DISPLAY MATERIALIZES: 
COMPUTER VOICE Welcome back, Ambassador Spock. 
KIRK (awkwardly) Wow.   That's weird. 
He looks to Kirk in surprise -- Spock's eyes fix with sudden understanding. Ambassador Spock... of course... suddenly all the pieces start coming together... 
SPOCK Computer: what is your manufacturing origin? 
COMPUTER VOICE Stardate 2397, commissioned by the Vulcan Science Academy. 
Spock looks at Kirk, a touch upset: 
SPOCK It appears you've been keeping rather important information from me. 
PIKE ... Kirk? 
KIRK Came back, Sir. Just like you ordered. 
Kirk helps LIFT HIM -- but what he DOESN'T SEE are the FOUR GUARDS entering with weapons -- 
221   CONTINUED:                                                      221 
But PIKE, God bless him, does: summoning his last ounce of strength, he manages to UNHOLSTER KIRK'S PHASER AND BLASTS THE FOUR GUARDS OUT OF EXISTENCE! Safe, he SLUMPS, dropping the phaser --

KIRK, SPOCK... AND PIKE MATERIALIZE ON THE PAD: 
KIRK (to Transporter Chief) Nice timing, Lieutenant -- 
SCOTTY Never beamed two targets from two places onto the same pad before! That was pretty good! 
Kirk transfers Pike to McCoy, who urgently SCANS Pike and barks to a MED-TECH:

KIRK Hail them -- now! 
NERO appears on screen from the Narada bridge -- the Narada's on its last legs -- a beat before Nero TURNS, realizing Kirk's fucking GRINNING at him from the screen: 
KIRK (CONT'D) This is Captain James T. Kirk of the U.S.S. Enterprise -- your ship is compromised -- too close to the singularity to survive without assistance -- which we are willing to provide. 
SPOCK (sotto) Captain -- what are you doing? 
KIRK (sotto) We show them compassion-- it may be the only way to earn peace with Romulus. It's logic, Spock! I thought you'd like that. 
SPOCK No, not really, not this time. 
NERO I would rather suffer the death of Romulus a thousand times than accept assistance from you. 
KIRK You got it. (turns) Lock phasers! Fire everything we've got!

243   INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY                   243 
MUSIC STILL BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at dock, UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud -- and we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, a man. The ACADEMY PRESIDENT stands at a podium:

Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar -- past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention: 
ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D) Your inspirational valor and supreme dedication to your comrades are in keeping with the highest traditions of service and reflect utmost credit to yourself, your crew, and the Federation. For your... unique solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it's my honor to award you with a commendation for original thinking. 
He opens a BOX -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL: 
ACADEMY PRESIDENT (CONT'D) By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby directed to report to Commanding Officer, USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief. 
Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey -- but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE: 
KIRK I relieve you, Sir. 
PIKE I am relieved. Congratulations, Captain. 
Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest. 
KIRK Thank you, Sir. 
Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE. As Kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to the BACK of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond words. He turns and leaves them to it... and our MUSIC SWELLS as --

SULU Maneuvering thrusters and impulse engines at your command, Sir. 
CHEKOV Weapons systems and shields on standby. 
UHURA Dock control reports ready.    Yard Command signalling clear. 
KIRK Scotty how are we? 
SCOTTY (O.S. OVER COMM LINK) Dilithium chamber at maximum efficiency, Captain. 
MCCOY (wry grin) Same ship, different day. 
And Kirk pauses. His eyes go over to the empty science console with a sense of incompleteness. In fact, everyone on the bridge feels it. A bitter truth they'll have to accept. 
KIRK Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrus-- 
WHOOSH: the turbolift door opens.      SPOCK!!!   Wearing his BLUE UNIFORM. Our hearts soar -- 
SPOCK Permission to come aboard, Captain. 
KIRK ... Permission granted. 
SPOCK As you have yet to select a first officer, respectfully, I would like to submit my candidacy. Should you desire, I can provide character references. 
Kirk nearly laughs. Spock's eyebrow goes up. Something passes between them... it carries acceptance, and trust... 
KIRK It would be my honor, Commander. Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu.     Take us out. 
SULU Aye, Captain.

On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him. MICHAEL is naked. HANNA takes his clothes from the chair. He gets into the bath. She goes to the balcony. In the bath, he submerges himself. HANNA goes out and shakes his clothes out in the open air. 
When he comes up from under the water, she is laying his clothes back on the chair. She picks up the shampoo and hands it to him. 
HANNA Wash your hair, I'll get you a towel. 
MICHAEL washes his hair, then submerges again. When he comes back up, HANNA is holding out a large towel. He gets out, turning away to hide his erection. From behind, she wraps his body and rubs him dry. Then she lets the towel fall. She puts her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. He turns and faces her. 
HANNA So. That's why you came back. 
MICHAEL looks at her, awed. 
MICHAEL You're so incredibly beautiful. 
HANNA Now, kid, you know that's not true. 
At once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. MICHAEL goes down onto the floor, HANNA on top of him. All the time, she's staring into his eyes. He can't take it. He closes his eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. She puts her hand over his mouth to smother the noise. 
INT. DINING ROOM. BERG APARTMENT. NIGHT 
The family is half-way through their meal. MICHAEL is sitting watching them eat, thinking about his lovemaking with HANNA. 
PETER You've inconvenienced your mother. 
MICHAEL How many more times? I've said I'm sorry. 
PETER You scared her. 
MICHAEL It's hardly my fault, I got lost, that's all. That's why I was late. Can I have some more? 
He reaches for more stew. THOMAS goes on eating, a look of contempt on his face, too superior to engage in this. 
EMILY How can anyone get lost in their own home town? 
MICHAEL The doctor told me I had to take walks. 
EMILY So? 
MICHAEL I meant to head for the castle, I ended up at the sports-field. 
EMILY They're in opposite directions. 
MICHAEL It's none of your business. 
EMILY He's lying. 
CARLA He's not lying. Michael never lies. 
CARLA smiles benignly. EMILY knows she's right. They all eat on for a few moments. 
MICHAEL Dad, I've decided, I want to go back to school tomorrow. 
CARLA The doctor says you need another three weeks. 
MICHAEL Well I'm going. 
CARLA Peter? 
PETER If he wants to go back, then he must. 
MICHAEL can't breathe, as if some decisive moment in his life has been reached. PETER is looking at him, seeming to know what's going on. 
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. EVE 
Later. Dark. MICHAEL is almost asleep, HANNA awake. 
HANNA You never tell me what you've been studying. 
MICHAEL Studying? 
HANNA At school. Do you learn languages? 
MICHAEL Yes. 
HANNA What languages? 
MICHAEL Latin. 
HANNA Say something in Latin. 
MICHAEL Oh... 
MICHAEL thinks a moment. 
MICHAEL Quo, quo scelesti ruitis? Aut cur dexteris aptantur enses conditi? 
MICHAEL smiles slightly. 
MICHAEL It's Horace. 
HANNA It's wonderful. 
MICHAEL Do you want some Greek? 
MICHAEL grins, pleased to be able to do something. He goes and gets his satchel. HANNA turns on a light. 
MICHAEL Oi men ippeon stroton oi de pesedon oi da naon phais epi gan malainan emmenai kalliston, ego de ken otto tis eratai. 
HANNA It's beautiful. 
MICHAEL How can you tell? How do you know when you've no idea what it means? 
HANNA looks at him a moment. 
HANNA What about in German? 
MICHAEL In German? 
HANNA Do you have anything? 
MICHAEL Well, I'm writing an essay. It's about a play. By a writer called Gotthold Ephraim Lessing. Perhaps you've heard of him? 
HANNA makes no reaction. 
MICHAEL The play's called Emilia Galotti. 
HANNA Have you got it? 
MICHAEL reaches down to the satchel and pulls out a book. 
MICHAEL Here. You can read it. 
HANNA I'd rather listen to you. 
HANNA lets herself in, saying nothing. 
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY 
HANNA has gone in to put down her things at the kitchen table. MICHAEL follows, desperate. 
MICHAEL I got up - at 4.30 - specially - it's the first day of the holidays, I'd been planning to surprise you - 
HANNA Poor little baby. Got up at four thirty - and on your holidays too. 
MICHAEL What is this? I was on your tram! You totally ignored me! What do you think I was doing? Why the hell do you think I was there? 
MICHAEL has yelled in desperation. HANNA looks him straight in the eye. 
HANNA I haven't the slightest idea. And what you do is your business not mine. 
HANNA turns and moves away. 
HANNA And if you wanted to speak to me, I was in the first carriage. So why did you sit in the second? 
HANNA goes to run a bath. 
HANNA And now, thanks very much, I've been working, I need a bath. Get out, I'd like to be by myself. 
MICHAEL I didn't mean to upset you. 
HANNA You don't have the power to upset me. You don't matter enough to upset me. 
She takes off her clothes to get in. As soon as she does, he gets up and goes into the other room. He sits by himself, miserable. He hears her, bathing. Then finally gets up and goes back in. She is still in the bath. 
MICHAEL I don't know what to say. I've never been with a woman. We've been together four weeks and I can't live without you. I can't. Even the thought of it kills me. 
HANNA looks at him thoughtfully. 
MICHAEL I sat in the second carriage because I thought you might kiss me. 
HANNA Kid, you thought we could make love in a tram? 
They smile. But MICHAEL has a more urgent question. 
MICHAEL Is it true what you said? That I don't matter to you? 
In the bath, she shakes her head. 
MICHAEL Do you forgive me? 
She nods. 
MICHAEL Do you love me? 
She looks at him. Then she nods. 
INT. BEDROOM. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY 
MICHAEL is sitting on the side of the bed. HANNA comes in, wrapped in a towel. 
HANNA Do you have a book? 
MICHAEL Oh. Well I do. I took something with me this morning. 
HANNA What is it? 
MICHAEL Whisky! By thunder, whisky. `Whisky? Come now captain, you can't be serious.' 
HANNA All right, kid, that's enough for today. 
They fall back onto the bed. 
MICHAEL I was wondering, do you think you could get some time off? Maybe we could go for a trip. 
HANNA What sort of trip? 
MICHAEL I'd love to go bicycling. Just for two days. 
MICHAEL reaches for a book. 
MICHAEL I've got a guide-book. I've worked out the route. Look, what do you think? 
HANNA'S look is so far-away she doesn't seem to hear the question. Silence. Then : 
HANNA I think you like planning, don't you? 
She throws the book away and they begin to make love. 
INT. BEDROOM. BERG APARTMENT. DAWN 
First light. Dawn breaking outside the window. MICHAEL is working at his desk, the surface covered in stamps, his collection book open. He picks one with a pyramid on it and looks at it. Underneath, MICHAEL'S VOICE reading Intrigue and Love by Schiller. 
MICHAEL'S VOICE "I'm not frightened. I'm not frightened of anything. Why should I be? I welcome obstacles, because they'll be like mountains I can fly over to be in your arms. The more I suffer, the more I'll love... 
INT & EXT. SHOP. DAY 
Seen from outside, a shop full of stamps. MICHAEL and a STAMP DEALER with white hair and a moustache. MICHAEL is offering his pyramid stamp, his gestures becoming desperate as the STAMP DEALER shakes his head, clearly not giving him as much as he hopes. 
Then MICHAEL concedes, the DEALER concedes, and a bunch of notes are handed across. MICHAEL runs exhilarated out into the street. 
MICHAEL'S VOICE "Danger will only increase my love, it will sharpen it, it will give it spice. I'll be the only angel you need. On this arm, Luise, you will go dancing through life. You will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. Heaven will take you back and look at you and say `Only one thing can make a soul complete, and that thing is love.' 
EXT. HILL. DAY 
HANNA and MICHAEL are whizzing down a hill together on bicycles. He has a rucksack. It's a rural paradise - hills on all sides, a gleaming river below, the sun shining brightly. She is wearing a blue dress. 
EXT. CAFE. DAY 
They come to a cafe and sit down outside. They pick up the menus on the table. A WAITRESS arrives. 
WAITRESS So what would you like to have? 
MICHAEL What are you having? 
HANNA You order. I'll have what you have. 
MICHAEL starts giving the order. Next to them are a group of BOY SCOUTS, who are laughing among themselves. 
BOYS There's sausages, sausages or sausages. Give it to me, come on, give it here. Let me have a look. You always have the same thing. 
They all laugh. HANNA watches them nervously. 
EXT. CAFE. DAY 
The meal finished, MICHAEL is alone, paying the bill. 
WAITRESS I hope your mother was happy. 
INT. STAIRWAY. SCHOOL. DAY 
1958. A sheriff's posse of sixteen-year old GIRLS, come laughing, blushing towards the classroom. One of them is talking excitedly to the other. 
SOPHIE I'm just going to pretend I've been here for years, I'm not going to behave in any special way. 
GIRL You just wait. You wait and see. 
They smile together and head for the classroom. 
INT. SCHOOL. DAY 
The BOYS are already in place, dotted round, as the GIRLS come in. There are cries of `Here they come'. Then the TEACHER comes in. 
TEACHER Good morning, ladies. Gentlemen, please welcome your new fellow- students, treat them with courtesy, please. 
Not far from MICHAEL, a GIRL sits across the aisle, virginal with brown hair, brown summer skin. 
SOPHIE Hello. My name's Sophie. 
MICHAEL I'm Michael. 
The TEACHER comes in. The class quietens. 
INT. SCHOOL. DAY 
Later. The TEACHER is in full flow. MICHAEL can't take his eyes off SOPHIE. 
TEACHER Everyone believes that Homer's subject is homecoming. In fact, The Odyssey is a book about a journey. Home is a place you dream of, it's not a place you ever attain. 
The TEACHER breaks off. 
TEACHER Berg, I don't mean to distract you, but we're meant to studying Homer, not studying Sophia. 
The whole class cracks up. MICHAEL blushes. 
EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY 
MICHAEL is riveted as SOPHIE swims fast and lithe through the water. Around him, YOUNG PEOPLE are lounging round on towels. It's the social centre. HOLGER and RUDOLF are rubbing their hair with towels as SOPHIE approaches. 
HOLGER Michael the water's fantastic. 
MICHAEL It's wonderful, isn't it? 
HOLGER Wonderful. It's going to be a great summer. 
MICHAEL looks across to where a group of AMERICANS are shouting and playing a very loud game of volleyball. 
HOLGER Now the Americans have allowed us back in our own lake. 
SOPHIE Why are they so loud? 
HOLGER You should see their stores. They have everything. 
MICHAEL Oh sure. Everything mankind could ever dream of. 
SOPHIE You don't like Americans? 
MICHAEL Just it's more fun without them. 
He looks SOPHIE straight in the eye. There is a sudden silence, MICHAEL looking straight at SOPHIE. SOPHIE looks down. Then MICHAEL moves slightly to pack up his stuff. 
HANNA just shrugs. She goes and sits at the table to drink tea. MICHAEL is irritated. 
MICHAEL You never ask, you never bother to ask how I am. 
HANNA You never say. 
MICHAEL It just happens to be my birthday. It's my birthday, that's all. In fact, you've never even asked when it is. 
HANNA Look if you want a fight, kid... 
MICHAEL No, I don't want a fight. What's wrong with you? 
HANNA What business is it of yours? 
She has snapped at him, razor-like. 
MICHAEL It's always on your terms. Everything. We do what you want. It's always what you want. My friends were giving me a party! 
HANNA Well then why are you here? Go back to your party. Isn't that what you want? 
HANNA puts down her cup, angry. She goes into the bedroom and slams the door. He sits, the magic of the day gone. He gets up and opens the bedroom door. HANNA is on the bed. 
MICHAEL And it's always me that has to apologize. 
Silence. HANNA lets time go by. Then : 
HANNA You don't have to apologize. No-one has to apologize. No-one can make you. 
HANNA reaches for a book from beside the bed. She throws it down on the cover. 
HANNA War and Peace, kid. 
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY 
HANNA is on the edge of the bath, running water. She has a pale blue flowered smock. She is running with sweat. The smock sticks to her. MICHAEL gets out a book. HANNA drops lavender oil into the bath. MICHAEL stands in the bath and she washes his body. 
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY 
They are making love on the bed. It's intense. At one point she moves on top of him. She holds his head between her hands, as if she would crush the life out of him. Then she lets go. 
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY 
They are both sweating, exhausted. She looks a moment. 
HANNA Now you must go back to your friends. 
INT. HANNA'S APARTMENT. DAY 
MICHAEL has gone. HANNA washes out milk bottles and empties them into the sink. Then she picks up her luggage and leaves the empty apartment. 
EXT. SWIMMING LAKE. DAY 
MICHAEL is sitting on the pier watching as HOLGER, RUDOLF and SOPHIE swim competitively out to a pontoon, then turn back, full of energy and high spirits. MICHAEL watches for a while, then suddenly he gets up and starts to run away from them all. 
SOPHIE Michael. You all right? 
But MICHAEL is running away across the lakeside beach. 
INT. LANDING & HANNA'S APARTMENT. DUSK 
MICHAEL opens the door. He goes in. The apartment is emptied, the rented furniture in place, all trace of HANNA gone. He looks round. He looks at the empty bath, the tap above it. He opens the kitchen cupboards - some coffee, sugar, that's about it. He goes into the bedroom, the bed stripped bare. He lies down on the bed. 
MICHAEL So how will you decide? 
JULIA I don't know. I'm happy back in Berlin, I suppose. 
MICHAEL You've seen your mother? 
JULIA nods. 
JULIA I wanted to get away. There was nothing more to it. It was Paris, but it could have been anywhere. 
MICHAEL Away from your parents? 
JULIA doesn't answer. 
MICHAEL I'm aware I was difficult. I wasn't always open with you. I'm not open with anyone. 
JULIA I knew you were distant. I'd always assumed it was my fault. 
MICHAEL Julia. How wrong can you be? 
JULIA colours, on the verge of tears. Then she looks away. 
INT & EXT. CAR. NIGHT 
They drive through the gleaming streets. It's been raining - Berlin is glistening. Their voices : 
MICHAEL I admit it now, I was nervous. 
JULIA I was nervous too. It's silly isn't it? 
MICHAEL It is silly. 
JULIA Thank you for dinner. 
MICHAEL I'll see you very soon. 
EXT. CAR. DAY 
MICHAEL lets JULIA out, and is watching her safely to her door from the car. 
JULIA Good night, Dad. 
MICHAEL suddenly gets out himself. 
MICHAEL Julia, wait. I want to ask you a favour. 
JULIA What favour? 
MICHAEL I want to take you on a trip. I want to show you something. 
JULIA When? 
MICHAEL Tomorrow, maybe. Can I pick you up in the car? 
JULIA doesn't need to say anything. 
MICHAEL At ten, say. 
JULIA smiles. 
MICHAEL Then good. 
INT. TOWN HALL. DAY 
A courtroom has been improvised inside the town hall. There are large windows, with milky glass, down the left-hand side. As ROHL and the STUDENTS arrive, the court is a melee of PHOTOGRAPHERS, LAWYERS and PUBLIC. The three JUDGES are already in place, next to six selected CITIZENS. MICHAEL and the others take places in the gallery 
CLERK All photographers are now asked to leave. 
The PHOTOGRAPHERS go. 
JUDGE The defendants, please. 
From being noisy and chaotic, the court is now silent. 
JUDGE The first thing I'm going to do is hear motions from each of the defendants' lawyers. (MORE) 
JUDGE (cont'd) They're going to be arguing that there's no reason to keep the defendants in jail until the outcome of the forthcoming trial. 
DIETER grins at MICHAEL in anticipation. 
JUDGE I am going to take these cases one by one. 
MICHAEL is leaning down to get stuff out of his briefcase, as MARTHE shakes a pen which isn't working. 
MICHAEL Do you want a pen? 
MARTHE I've got a pen. 
So MICHAEL doesn't hear as the JUDGE speaks. 
JUDGE Hanna Schmitz. 
There is a row of six DEFENDANTS. The fifth woman is HANNA, her hair tied in a knot, her gaze fixedly into the middle distance, not looking towards the SPECTATORS. She is wearing a grey dress with short sleeves. They all sit, sideways to the gallery. HANNA rises to her feet. The words seem to come very quietly, across a great distance. 
JUDGE Your name is Hanna Schmitz? 
HANNA Yes. 
It is only when the JUDGE repeats the name that MICHAEL looks up, hearing it for the first time. 
JUDGE Can you speak louder please? 
HANNA My name is Hanna Schmitz. 
MICHAEL is rigid, blank, just staring. 
JUDGE Thank you. You were born on October 21st, 1922? 
HANNA Yes. 
JUDGE At Hermannstadt. And you're now 43 years old? 
HANNA Yes. 
JUDGE You joined the SS in 1943? 
HANNA Yes. 
JUDGE What was your reason? What was your reason for joining? 
HANNA doesn't answer. 
JUDGE You were working at the Siemens factory at the time? 
ROHL Why? Why did you think it exciting? 
DIETER Because it's justice. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE. DAY 
The train hurtles through the German countryside. 
INT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT 
A student party, in a candle-lit room. MARTHE is singing to a guitar. It's been going on for hours - the STUDENTS are on the floor with beer and cigarettes. The front door is open. DIETER, beer in hand, looks out to the balcony where he can see MICHAEL bent away from them, all by himself. 
EXT. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT 
MICHAEL, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out into the night. His eye lands on a student room in which a couple are making love. 
INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY 
The small STUDENT GROUP is now rattling around informally in the big lecture room. 
ROHL I need to correct an impression. Dieter said yesterday this was about justice. But is it? (MORE) 
ROHL (cont'd) If it were about justice you might ask why has it taken so long? The war ended twenty years ago. Remember, there've been no significant trials between Nuremburg in 1946 and the Auschwitz trials a couple of years ago. That's a long gap. What's the reason for the gap? 
ROHL waits a moment for a STUDENT to answer. 
DIETER I'd have thought it was obvious. 
ROHL Say. 
DIETER Cowardice. It's cowardice, isn't it? It's bad conscience. It's the big cover-up. 
ROHL Go on. 
DIETER After the war. The German people didn't want to look at what they'd done. 
ROHL Is that right? 
DIETER Because they had too much to hide. All our parents are liars. All right, mine are. So it's left to us, isn't it? 
ROHL How so? 
DIETER Because we're not implicated. 
ROHL Aren't you? Good. So that's all right then. 
Everyone laughs. 
MARTHE No, but seriously, Dieter's right. My parents, I can't even talk to them. I don't love them. How could I? How could anyone love them? Because they've told themselves so many lies, they can't remember the truth, let alone admit it. Isn't that why we signed up for this seminar? 
ROHL I don't know. You tell me. 
MARTHE Speaking for myself. 
ROHL Michael? 
MICHAEL I'm not sure any more. 
ROHL is staring at him thoughtfully. 
ROHL What did your father do, Dieter? 
ROHL is very still, like an analyst who is finally leading his patient to the heart of things. 
ROHL How so? 
DIETER This didn't happen to the Germans. It happened to the Jews. 
Everyone is shocked at his violent passion. 
DIETER What are we trying to do? 
MICHAEL We're trying to understand. 
DIETER Six women locked    three hundred Jews in a church, and    let them burn. What is there to    understand? Tell me, I'm asking :    what is there to understand? 
MICHAEL can't answer. DIETER gets up, outraged now. 
DIETER I started out believing in this trial, I thought it was great, now I think it's just a diversion. 
ROHL Yes? Diversion from what? 
DIETER You choose six women, you put them on trial, you say `They were the evil ones, they were the guilty ones'. Brilliant! (MORE) 
DIETER (cont'd) Because one of the victims happened to write a book! That's why they're on trial and nobody else. Do you know how many camps there were in Europe? 
DIETER turns, furious. 
DIETER People go on about how much did everyone know? `Who knew?' `What did they know?' That isn't the question. The question is `How could you let it happen?' And - better - `Why didn't you kill yourself when you found out?' 
One of the group walks out. 
DIETER Thousands! That's how many. There were thousands of camps. Everyone knew. 
DIETER'S passion is so great that everyone is shaken. 
DIETER Look at that woman... 
MICHAEL Which woman? 
DIETER The woman you're always staring at. I'm sorry but you are. 
MICHAEL is white. The atmosphere is electric. 
MICHAEL I don't know which woman you mean. 
DIETER You know what I'd do? Put the gun in my hand, I'd shoot her myself. 
EXT. EMPTY ROAD. DAY 
MICHAEL walks along an empty wooded road, miles from anywhere. The sun is shining through the trees behind him. 
EXT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY 
The wire fence of a concentration camp, deserted. MICHAEL, with a back-pack, goes alone through the metal gate. MICHAEL walks among the deserted empty huts. 
INT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY 
Inside one of the huts, MICHAEL is by himself staring at a line of empty beds. He moves on, overwhelmed, lost. He passes through the showers. Then he comes to a room with vast metal cages on either side. In the cages, the countless dusty shoes of the exterminated. 
INT. STRUTHOF CAMP. DAY 
MICHAEL opens a door and walks into a room with a line of gas ovens. He walks past them. Then he stands beside them, his head down. 
The other DEFENDANTS interrupt to call out `She was in charge'. 
JUDGE Did you write the report? 
HANNA No. No. We all discussed what to say. We all wrote it together. 
BECKHART She wrote it! She wrote the report. She was in charge. 
JUDGE Is that true? 
HANNA No. And I didn't write the report. Does it matter who did? 
RITA BECKHART has called out from her place. The JUDGE looks at HANNA a moment. 
JUDGE I need to see a sample of your handwriting. 
HANNA My handwriting? 
JUDGE Yes. I need to establish who wrote the report. 
At once HANNA'S COUNSEL rises. 
HANNA'S COUNSEL I'm sorry, but I really don't see how that's appropriate. Nearly twenty years have gone by. 
JUDGE Somebody take her this piece of paper. 
HANNA'S COUNSEL Are you really going to compare handwriting of twenty years ago, with handwriting of today? 
JUDGE Give her the paper. Counsel, approach the bench. 
A piece of paper and a pen are put down in front of HANNA. Her COUNSEL moves to the bench. MICHAEL stares, first at her, then at the pen and paper, an apprehension rising in him. 
INT & EXT. DAY AND NIGHT. FLASHBACKS 
MICHAEL thinks back, to HANNA in her bedroom saying `No you read', to her looking puzzled at the menu on the bicycle trip, and to her throwing a book away in the apartment. At this moment, MICHAEL realises she is illiterate. 
INT. COURTROOM. DAY 
Back in the courtroom, HANNA looks up to the JUDGE to stop the conference. 
HANNA There's no need. I wrote the report. 
MICHAEL, in a panic, pushes along his row, past ROHL and the others, who all look up, knowing something is going on. HANNA turns, as if sensing him behind her. 
INT. STAIRS. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY 
MICHAEL is sitting on the steps outside the lecture room. ROHL walks straight past him. 
ROHL You've been skipping seminars. 
INT. LECTURE ROOM. HEIDELBERG LAW SCHOOL. DAY 
MICHAEL comes into the room and sits down, smoking a cigarette. ROHL waits. 
ROHL So? 
MICHAEL looks at him. 
MICHAEL I have a piece of information. Concerning one of the defendants. Something they're not admitting. 
ROHL What information? 
EXT. PRISON YARD. DAY 
MICHAEL turns away and heads back the way he came. 
INT. MEETING ROOM. PRISON. DAY 
HANNA looks round. Nobody is coming. She waits more. 
GUARD Time's up. 
INT. PRISON. EVE 
HANNA is still waiting. Then she is led back to her cell. 
INT. MARTHE'S ROOM. STUDENT DIGS. NIGHT 
MICHAEL appears at the door of MARTHE'S room. She is working at her desk. He smiles and closes the door. 
MARTHE You've taken your time. 
They kiss. She starts to pull his clothes off. He lets her. He makes no move to undress her. She takes all his clothes off until he is naked, and she remains clothed. He looks at her a moment, then takes her in his arms and they go down on the bed. They make love. 
INT. MARTHE'S ROOM. NIGHT 
MARTHE is apparently asleep, MICHAEL awake. As quietly as he can MICHAEL tries to slip away. 
MARTHE Where are you going? 
MICHAEL I'm sorry. I need to sleep by myself. 
INT. REMAND CELL. DAWN 
HANNA is standing naked at the sink, preparing herself for the day. 
INT. STUDENT DIGS. MICHAEL'S ROOM. DAWN 
MICHAEL is lying in his own bed, staring up at the ceiling, not able to sleep. MICHAEL reluctantly pushes back the cover and gets naked out of bed. Slowly he begins to dress. 
INT. REMAND CELL. DAY 
HANNA washes herself, naked. 
INT. STUDENT DIGS. DAY 
MICHAEL is dressed now. He stands in front of his mirror, adjusting his tie. 
INT. REMAND CELL. DAY 
HANNA stands in front of the mirror, tying her tie. There is a small, inadequate mirror in which she checks her dress - a black suit, a white blouse and black tie. She looks very formal. 
INT. PRISON. DAY 
HANNA is led through the prison by a GUARD. 
EXT. TOWN HALL. DAY 
A lot of people heading into the courtroom. As the seminar group goes in, MICHAEL hangs back. ROHL looks at him as he goes through the doors. MICHAEL is left outside, then goes to watch as the vans arrive. 
INT. COURTROOM. TOWN HALL. DAY 
HANNA and the PRISONERS are led into the court. HANNA'S suit is so formal that members of the public call out. `Nazi! Nazi!' DIETER leans in to MARTHE. HANNA walks on to her place. 
CARLA Were you really so unhappy? 
MICHAEL That's not what I'm saying. It's not what I meant. 
CARLA Well then? 
CARLA looks at him hard. 
MICHAEL You mustn't worry about Gertrud. I'm going to look after her. And anyway, let's face it, she's already a state prosecutor, she earns far more than I do. 
CARLA Michael, I'm not worried about Gertrud. I'm worried about you. 
INT. TRAIN. EVE 
Exhausted by her day, JULIA is sleeping in MICHAEL'S arms. He looks down at her, full of love. 
EXT. SCHONEBERG. BERLIN. NIGHT 
On the other side of a busy Berlin street full of traffic, MICHAEL holds JULIA'S hand, a loving father, to guide her across the street. 
INT. LANDING. GERTRUD'S APARTMENT. BERLIN. NIGHT 
GERTRUD has come to the door, a shrewd-looking intelligent woman, a little older than MICHAEL, very thin, in slacks and a blouse. MICHAEL is standing outside with JULIA. 
JULIA Hello Mummy. 
GERTRUD Hello beautiful. 
GERTRUD leans down and scoops JULIA up, kisses her. MICHAEL stands on the step, hovering. 
GERTRUD Do you mind if I don't ask you in? 
MICHAEL I don't mind at all. I've a lot to do, in fact. 
It doesn't look like it. He stands, not going. 
MICHAEL I took her to see where I grew up. 
GERTRUD You went to the West? My God, what a trip. 
JULIA We went to say hello to granny. 
GERTRUD Oh. Daddy took you to see Carla, did he? 
JULIA She was strange. 
GERTRUD Come on, let's see what's on TV. 
GERTRUD gives JULIA her supper and puts her in front of the TV. Then she comes back to MICHAEL. 
GERTRUD I bet she was strange. 
MICHAEL You could say. 
GERTRUD She always was. Why on earth did you decide to do that? 
MICHAEL I don't know. Impulse. 
GERTRUD says nothing. 
MICHAEL I suppose if I'm honest we went because I wanted to re-establish contact. 
In panic, she turns it off. 
INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. EVE 
MICHAEL presses the recording button and speaks into the machine. 
MICHAEL The Odyssey by Homer. "Sing to me of the Man, Muse, the man of twists and turns Driven time and again off course, once he had plundered The hallowed heights of Troy... Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds, Many pains he suffered, heartsick at the open sea, Fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home... 
INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. NIGHT 
Later. MICHAEL is now walking up and down, in his shorts and T-shirt, microphone in hand, still reading. 
MICHAEL "Ah, how shameless - the way these mortals blame the gods. From us alone, they say, come all their miseries... 
INT. BEDROOM. NIGHT 
Middle of the night. MICHAEL is lying on his back, still reading. 
MICHAEL "Who are you? Where are you from? Your city? Your parents? I'm wonderstruck - you drank my drugs, you're not bewitched..." 
INT. LIVING ROOM. DAY 
MICHAEL takes a cassette and puts it into a white box. He writes on the side ODYSSEY 6. Then he reaches up to put it on a shelf next to boxes separately marked ODYSSEY 1,2,3,4,5. Then he takes out a small notebook and cross-references the new tape in a handwritten list. 
INT. CELL. NIGHT 
It's dark. HANNA is lying on the bed. 
MICHAEL'S VOICE Zeus from the very start, the thunder king Has hated the race of Atreus with a vengeance - (MORE) 
MICHAEL'S VOICE (cont'd) His trustiest weapon women's twisted wiles... 
HANNA smiles with pleasure at his reading. 
INT & EXT. MONTAGE. DAY & NIGHT 
A montage of MICHAEL reading and HANNA listening. MICHAEL is reading different books. He is animated now, excited. There are extracts from The Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway) ; Anatol (Schnitzler) ; The World of Yesterday (Zweig) and Doctor Zhivago (Pasternak). MICHAEL catching fire with excitement with what he is doing. HANNA collecting the tapes from the mail room and organizing on her shelves - her library growing. 
INT. CELL. NIGHT 
HANNA is lying in bed listening to a new tape. 
MICHAEL The Lady with the Little   Dog, by Anton Chekhov. "The talk   was that a new face had appeared on   the promenade, a lady with a   little dog..." 
EXT. EXERCISE YARD. PRISON. DAY 
HANNA is walking round with other PRISONERS, in sequence. Suddenly she stops dead, an idea hitting her. 
INT. PRISON LIBRARY. DAY 
The library is right next to the mail room. HANNA walks past the mail room and goes to the library counter. 
HANNA I want to take out a book. 
LIBRARIAN Which book? 
HANNA Do you have The Lady with the Little Dog? 
LIBRARIAN What's your name? 
HANNA Hanna Schmitz. 
MS BRENNER (VOICE ON PHONE) You're Michael Berg? 
MICHAEL'S VOICE Yes. 
MS BRENNER (VOICE ON PHONE) You got my letter? 
MICHAEL I have it here. 
MS BRENNER (PHONE) As I say, Hanna Schmitz is coming up for release very soon. 
MICHAEL fingers the letter a moment. 
INT. BRENNER'S OFFICE. PRISON. DAY 
MS BRENNER is sitting at her desk in a simple, modern office. 
MS BRENNER Hanna has been in prison for over twenty years. She has no family. She has no friends. You're her only contact. And I'm told you don't visit her. 
INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY 
MICHAEL is sitting quite still. 
MICHAEL No. I don't. 
INT. BRENNER'S OFFICE. DAY 
MS BRENNER When she gets out, she's going to need a job. She's going to need somewhere to live. You can't imagine how frightening the modern world will seem to her. 
There is a silence. 
MICHAEL Yes. I'm still here. 
INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY 
MS BRENNER I have no-one else to ask. If you don't take responsibility for her, then Hanna has no future at all. 
MICHAEL It's kind of you. Thank you for letting me know. 
MICHAEL puts the phone down. He looks as if he has just been handed a sentence. He gets up and stares at the wall which is now stacked with all the books he has read. Then he goes to his balcony. 
EXT & INT. MICHAEL'S APARTMENT. KREUZBERG. DAY 
MICHAEL stands looking out over Berlin from his balcony. 
EXT. PRISON. DAY 
MICHAEL walks along the road by the prison wall, then goes to the guichet to sign in. 
EXT. PRISON YARD. DAY 
MICHAEL is waiting in a small barred waiting area as MS BRENNER walks across the yard to open the gate and let MICHAEL in. 
MS BRENNER You're Michael Berg? 
MICHAEL Yes. 
MS BRENNER Louisa Brenner. We were expecting you earlier. 
INT & EXT. STAIRS & PASSAGE. PRISON. DAY 
MS BRENNER is walking MICHAEL up the steps towards the prison canteen. They pass GUARDS and INMATES. 
MICHAEL I wasn't sure what you'd learnt. 
HANNA I have learnt, kid. I've learnt to read. 
MICHAEL stares, devastated. 
MICHAEL I'll pick you up next week, OK? 
HANNA That sounds a good plan. 
MICHAEL Good. Quietly, or shall we make a big fuss? 
HANNA Quietly. 
MICHAEL OK. Quietly. 
They look at each other. The other PRISONERS have already gone. They stand up. She scans his face again, searching for his thoughts. He takes her in his arms, a little awkward. 
HANNA Take care, kid. 
MICHAEL You too. 
They walk side by side, back towards the door. Then by way of saying goodbye, she takes his hand. 
MICHAEL See you next week. 
She stretches her arm out before she lets go of his hand, then vanishes inside. MICHAEL walks on alone. 
EXT. PRISON. EVE 
MICHAEL comes out of the main entrance. He stands a moment, looking round at the evening. MICHAEL walks to his car. 
INT. HANNA'S ROOM. EVE 
The room is simple, a bedroom to one side, a bathroom to the other. It is all furnished with simple functional furniture. The end of a hard day's work. MICHAEL hangs a picture over the desk - a landscape, reminiscent of where they once went cycling. The job is done. He looks round, grimly content. 
INT. CELL. DAWN 
HANNA is lying on her bed, fully dressed. She gets up and gets some books down from the shelf. She puts them, one by one, in a pile on the table. Then she takes off her shoes. She stands up and climbs onto the pile of books on the table. Her bare feet on the books. Then she reaches up. 
EXT & INT. PRISON. DAY 
MICHAEL gets out of the car. He is carrying a bunch of flowers. He walks towards the prison. He leans in to the GUARD who is in a modern office. 
INT. PRISON. DAY 
From the far end of the corridor, MICHAEL is seen sitting on a bench. MS BRENNER comes out of her office and murmurs in his ear. MICHAEL is seen nodding, ashen. 
INT. CORRIDOR & CELL. PRISON. DAY 
The two of them come together down the corridor. They stop at the open door of the cell. The body has been removed. The books are still on the floor. MICHAEL goes in. A bare table, a chair, a bed, a closet, a toilet in the corner behind the door. There are shelves with books, an alarm clock, a stuffed bear, two mugs, instant coffee, tea tins. 
MICHAEL She didn't pack. She never intended to leave. 
MS BRENNER looks at him in confirmation. MICHAEL looks at the two lower shelves on which are ranged the tapes with the cassette machine. 
Above the bed are a series of cuttings, pictures torn from magazines, showing meadows, hillsides, pasture, cherry trees. One in particular : a burst of autumnal colours. MICHAEL kneels on the bed to look at them. There are quotations, articles, recipes, even sayings in HANNA'S childish handwriting : `Spring lets its blue banner flutter through the air' is one. Then he sees a newspaper photograph : the young MICHAEL BERG receiving a prize from the school principal. The headline `Michael Berg receives school literature prize.' 
MS BRENNER reaches out for a tea tin from the shelf. Then she sits next to MICHAEL on the bed, and takes out a folded sheet of paper from her suit pocket. 
MS BRENNER She left me a message, a sort of will. I'll read out the bit that concerns you. 
MICHAEL No. No. She taught herself to read when she was in prison. I sent her tapes. She'd always liked being read to. 
ILANA shifts slightly. 
ILANA Why don't you start by being honest with me? At least start that way. What was the nature of your friendship? 
MICHAEL When I was young I had an affair with Hanna. 
ILANA looks at him for a moment. 
ILANA I'm not sure I can help you, Mr. Berg. Or rather, even if I could I'm not willing to. 
MICHAEL I was almost sixteen when I took up with her. The affair only lasted a summer. But. 
ILANA But what? 
MICHAEL just looks at her. 
ILANA I see. And did Hanna Schmitz acknowledge the effect she'd had on your life? 
MICHAEL stares back, understood for the first time. 
MICHAEL She'd done much worse to other people. I've never told anyone. 
ILANA People ask all the time what I learned in the camps. But the camps weren't therapy. What do you think these places were? Universities? We didn't go there to learn. One becomes very clear about these things. 
ILANA looks at him, unrelenting. 
ILANA What are you asking for? Forgiveness for her? Or do you just want to feel better yourself? My advice, go to the theatre, if you want catharsis. Please. Go to literature. Don't go to the camps. Nothing comes out of the camps. Nothing. 
ILANA looks at him, unrelenting. 
MICHAEL What she wanted...what she wanted was to leave you her money. I have with me. 
ILANA To do what? 
MICHAEL As you think fit. 
MICHAEL reaches for his briefcase. He takes out the lavender tea-tin, which he sets down on the table in front of ILANA. 
MICHAEL Here. 
ILANA lifts the tin. 
ILANA When I was a little girl, I had a tea-tin for my treasures. Not quite like this. It had Cyrillic lettering. I took it with me to the camp, but it got stolen. 
MICHAEL What was in it? 
ILANA Oh. Sentimental things. A piece of hair from our dog. Some tickets to operas my father had taken me to. It wasn't stolen for its contents. It was the tin itself which was valuable, what you could do with it. 
She sits a moment, overcome, her hand on the tin. 
ILANA There's nothing I can do with this money. If I give it to anything associated with the extermination of the Jews, then to me it will seem like absolution and that is something I'm neither willing nor in a position to grant. 
MICHAEL nods slightly. 
MICHAEL I was thinking maybe an organization to encourage literacy. 
ILANA Good. 
There's a silence.

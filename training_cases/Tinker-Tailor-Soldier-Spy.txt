1   EXT. HUNGARY - BUDAPEST - 1973 - DAY                          1 
Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building. From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters, cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian. 
2   EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY                                    2 
LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX. 
ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket? 
A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame. Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks over, shakes hands. 
Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked shirt, neither paying any attention to each other. 
Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction... 
3   EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - DAY                                        3 
Shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing GALERIA building on the corner ahead. Prideaux and the Magyar walk up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and head towards... 
4   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                                 4 
A formerly grand arcade. Many of the shops are now closed, the one's that are open don't have much to sell. A CAFE occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter. The ordinary world. 
We find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the tables. 
MAGYAR (Hungarian, subtitled) And porkolts. You know porkolts? 
JIM PRIDEAUX (Hungarian, subtitled) Yes, I've had it. 
MAGYAR It's very good. Better than goulash. But you won't get it in Budapest now. 
JIM PRIDEAUX Why's that? 
MAGYAR All the pigs have gone to Moscow. 
He gives a sly laugh. Prideaux smiles, draws   on his cigarette, nonchalantly examining the people   at the tables around them. A WAITER arrives, belly bulging   out of his grubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He   puts two wizened-looking sandwiches in front of them. 
PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the Waiter's face, drips onto the table top. 
The Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a wry smile - "nice service." Jim smiles back but a bell has begun to ring inside him. 
JIM PRIDEAUX When do I get to meet your friend? 
The Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is ignoring his. 
MAGYAR I'll take you to him. Not eating? 
Prideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner still easy, but his eyes flick after the Waiter, who stands at the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another man. He looks around the Galeria again, looking low - checking the feet of the other customers? Then raising his gaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which look down into the arcade. 
PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - An OLD WOMAN stands in the shadows by a window above. She is watching him. Catching his gaze she shrinks back into the darkness and disappears. 
Prideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee cup down and casually stands. The Magyar looks up in surprise. 
JIM PRIDEAUX Would you excuse me a moment? 
He starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria. Behind him his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back and lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to the domed ceiling. 
The WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic flashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of his belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing in the cavernous space. 
The shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and Prideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run, as behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal NIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing, like actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some drawing guns. We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in Russian. 
KGB MAN No firing! 
Ahead of Prideaux   more figures appear, blocking the exit. He looks over his   shoulder just as another SHOT rings out - this one catching   him above the shoulder blade and sending him flying out of   frame. 
From around a corner a tall, over-coated man - KGB - strides towards the scene, still bellowing in Russian. 
KGB MAN (CONT'D) Who told you to fire? Who told you to fucking fire? 
THE JAZZ BAND have stopped playing and are staring at the ground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything. 
In the TOP WINDOW - the OLD WOMAN slips back into sight. 
HER P.O.V. - Prideaux lies face down in the arcade below. As we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of blood. Then he's still. 
BELOW - The KGB Man has grabbed the Waiter and started to beat him. 
KGB MAN (CONT'D) Fucking Hungarian amateur! We wanted him alive! 
Behind him we can see the breast-feeding MOTHER. She's dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the ricochet. The baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed. 
Through the cafe window we can see a MAN, partly obscured by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. He lights a cigarette. 
11   EXT. CIRCUS - DAY                                            11 
CONTROL and SMILEY stand on the street. They stare at each other for a moment. This is goodbye. They shake hands. Perhaps there's a little reserve in Control's manner, a lack of warmth. From the expression on Smiley's face we see that he is pained by this. 
Control puts his collar up and walks away. Smiley stands forlornly as Control disappears into the crowd. 
TITLES OVER A MONTAGE 
12   EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - AUTUMN DAY                             12 
THE WATER OF THE POND - still, glassy. 
A MAN'S head breaks the surface - Smiley swimming through his retirement. 
He takes a breath and submerges again. Beyond him we see a straggled diagonal line of elderly heads, bobbing through the water. 
13   EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - DAY                                    13 
Smiley dries himself under the trees, pink and raw in the cold fresh air. He smooths his hair down, feeling a little less ridiculous. He looks over to where a VERY ELDERLY SWIMMER is being helped into the water - little more than trembling bones. 
Is this his world now? 
14   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - DAY                              14 
A MOTHER unloads a stack of files from a LIFT shaft and places them into her wheeled safe. A piece of CHRISTMAS TINSEL is wound along the trolley. We track with her through the HIVE-LIKE atmosphere of the fifth floor, behind her the conference room - a glimpse of Alleline in Control's chair, surrounded by his lieutenants - smoke and whiskey - engaged in the business of the world. 
She pushes on into Alleline's OFFICE - loads the new files into the LARGE SAFE there, locks and spins the combination. 
15   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - WINTER DAY                             15 
Smiley stands frying an egg in his small kitchen. 
16   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    16 
Smiley sits eating his solitary lunch, reading a volume of Grimmelshausen. He turns a page, examines the illustration of a knight and a dragon - holds it at arms length, trying to focus on it. 
16A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT                      16A 
Smiley lies in the double bed, a conspicuous empty space next to him. He leans over and turns the light out. 
17    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - ALLELINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT        17 
A HAND removes files from the LARGE SAFE. 
ON A BRIEFCASE - as the files - marked TOP SECRET - are slipped inside. 
18    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - EVENING                          18 
P.O.V. MYSTERY MAN 
... TRACKING through the near-empty offices. All the drawers of the desks are OPEN. BINS on the tables. A few mothers working late, illuminated by their desk lamps. One of them is applying lipstick, prior to leaving. She doesn't react as we track by. 
19    EXT. OPTICIANS - SPRING DAY                                  19 
We are looking at large blurred LETTERS. A lens is slotted into our frame and the letters leap into BOLD. 
Smiley is in a chair, being fitted for spectacles. 
20    INT. OPTICIANS - DAY                                         20 
Smiley is selecting frames from a display. He tries on a pair, watched by a bored shop assistant, used to the pedantic ways of the retired. 
21    INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - EVENING                   21 
TRACKING with the BRIEFCASE as the mystery man walks towards the main entrance. The ELDERLY PORTER- BRYANT - nods respectfully. 
22    INT. LONDON UNDERGROUND - EVENING                            22 
A packed train - Businessmen in bowler hats, long-haired seventies youth - the old and the new bumping underneath the city. We track low level until we find our MYSTERY MAN, the BRIEFCASE clutched in his hand. 
23   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - EVENING                                   23 
Tracking with the BRIEFCASE as it is carried towards the house... 
24   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      24 
An elderly lady - MRS McCRAIG - stands at the sink. Through the window she catches a glimpse of the Mystery Man's legs passing, the briefcase in his hand as he walks up the steps towards the front door. Calmly she dries her hands as the doorbell rings and her DOG begins to bark furiously. 
25   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                      25 
Mrs McCraig opens the door and the figure passes her and the barking dog without a word and begins to walk up the stairs... 
26   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY                    26 
Smiley adds a LETTER to a pile on the mantelpiece. We see the letters are all addressed to ANN SMILEY. 
He straightens up, finds himself staring at a PAINTING on the wall - a muddy abstract. 
27   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                      27 
Smiley in his NEW GLASSES, towel rolled under his arm, walking down the street. He stops for a moment, feeling himself watched. 
36    EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                36 
Smiley on the steps to his home, stops, examines the door, removing a WEDGE from the top of the door frame. 
37    INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                37 
Smiley walks into the hallway, stopping to pick up post. 
38    INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                38 
Smiley places the wedge and the letters on the mantelpiece, where a BUNDLE of LETTERS already sits, addressed to ANN SMILEY. Unopened. 
38A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING                     38A 
Smiley frying an egg. 
There's a knock at the door. 
38B   INT./EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                          38B 
Smiley opens the door to PETER GUILLAM. 
SMILEY (Surprised) Hello, Peter. 
They stare at each other. Smiley takes in his expression - this is not a social call. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) Have I time to change? 
Guillam nods, following Smiley into the house. He glances at a painting on the wall - a muddy ABSTRACT. He crosses to examine it and then notices the bundle of Ann's unopened letters. 
39    INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - EVENING                                39 
Guillam enters the kitchen, notes the single place set for dinner. It dawns on him that he really has invaded Smiley's privacy. 
Smiley appears in a coat behind him, taking in Guillam's awkwardness. He gives a thin smile. 
SMILEY Are we going far? 
39A   INT. GUILLAM'S CAR - EVENING                               39A 
Smiley and Guillam sit in silence, as Guillam drives through London. It's a Citroen DS, all sleek leather and mahogany interior. 
40    OMITTED                                                      40 
40A   INT. LACON'S HOUSE - EVENING                               40A 
CLOSE UP ON: 
A half eaten bacon SANDWICH, sitting on a table. 
We pan up and through the open window see an anxious Lacon is leading Guillam towards the house. Smiley follows, talking to Lacon's daughter. 
LACON How's your mother? 
PETER GUILLAM Very well. (referring to the window) Is this where he got out? 
LACON Mmm, I came back in and it was wide open. (beat) Do send her my love. Apologies for singling you out, but... very sensitive matter... 
He gives an uncomfortable bark of laughter. 
LACON (CONT'D) If one can't trust one's own nephew... You know who he was? 
PETER GUILLAM Ricki Tarr, sir. One of my scalp- hunters. He's been on the wanted list for a year. Last job was Istanbul, bit of coat-trailing for a Russian convention. 
LACON Why is he on the wanted list? 
PETER GUILLAM (beat) He killed our man in Istanbul. Cut his throat. Been on the run since then. 
If possible, Lacon looks even more shaken. 
LACON My God. In my own home... my family... The bloody animals you people employ! 
41   INT. LACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                 41 
PULLING OLIVER LACON as he leads Smiley and Guillam down the hall, gesturing for his WIFE to take Jackie away. He attempts some social niceties, but his tone is strained. 
LACON And how are you George? Missing one's work, one's buddies? 
SMILEY Oh, I think I manage pretty well, thank you. 
They reach a large room, minimalist apart from a grand piano framed by vast glass windows. A tall, well built young man - FAWN - stands on guard. Lacon gestures to him and Fawn opens the french windows and he and Guillam walk out onto the terrace beyond. 
Behind them, unnoticed, young JACKIE creeps back into the room and slips behind the sofa. 
LACON Your wife, the lovely Ann? She's in the pink, and so on. 
SMILEY Very well. (Beat) Very bonny... 
47   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - DAY                                       47 
A shabby rooming house, near Paddington station. 
48   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY                       48 
A large, faded floral monstrosity of a room. TWO single beds, a large leather CHAIR, a WIRELESS. 
Smiley's new landlady MRS POPE GRAHAM is supervising a gormless teenager - NORMAN - who is struggling into the room with a rickety card table. Mendel and Guillam take it from him and set it into the room. From the next room comes the unmistakable sounds of someone having sex. 
MRS POPE GRAHAM (re the table) It's Georgian, I shouldn't lend it to you but since Mister Mendel recommends you... 
She gives the table a sentimental tap, raising her voice a little to drown out the excesses from the room next door. 
MRS POPE GRAHAM (CONT'D) You will love it for me won't you? It belonged to Mister Pope- Graham. 
She glances at Smiley who has his back to her looking out into the London street. 
SMILEY'S P.O.V. 
... looking out at rooftops opposite and a travel agents sign which reads THE WIDE WORLD. 
MENDEL (O.S.) My friend just wants peace and quiet in order to work, Mrs Pope- Graham, no disturbances. 
MRS POPE GRAHAM And that's what he shall have. You want anything you can ask Norman, can't he, Norman? 
And they leave. A small silence... 
MENDEL Her real name is plain Graham. Added the Pope for a touch of class. 
Guillam gives a grunt of amusement. 
MENDEL (CONT'D) Best informant I ever had. 
LATER: 
Smiley has turned his attention to the bed. He examines the stained sheets with distaste. As he speaks he strips off the soiled sheet and replaces it with a clean one from his bag. 
SMILEY Control lived with his sister didn't he? 
He straightens up from the bed, smooths the pristine sheet. 
Mendel flips his notebook back. He's already there. 
MENDEL Basingstoke. Not much of a paper- trail as you can imagine. His pension and she owns a block of bedsits in her own name in West London. 
GUILLAM We should... 
Mendel flicks another page. 
MENDEL ... Webb and Bryson are the letting agents. Properties in half of the west end judging by this list... 
LATER: 
Guillam is lying on the bed. Smiley stands at the window, Mendel slumped in an armchair. 
SMILEY We're only looking for short term rentals. Within the last year. 
MENDEL (Reading from the list) A Miss Hilliard. L. Cavaleri? D Weaver, M Crowley, M Cushing. F. Farling. G. Hiaasen. (MORE) 
MENDEL (CONT'D) A Mrs Hawcombe. R. Kee. M. Kass. H Staunton... 
CLOSE on Smiley as his eyes flickers at the name. 
MENDEL (CONT'D) K. Menzies... 
SMILEY How long was H. Staunton a tenant? 
MENDEL (Consulting the list) Still is. Been renting for a few years now. Something? 
SMILEY (Musing) Howard Staunton. Control used to say he was England's greatest chess master. Died in eighteen seventy- four. 
49   EXT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   49 
Guillam and Smiley approach outside a red-brick mansion block of flats in West London. 
50   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - HALLWAY - DAY                         50 
Smiley and Guillam reach a flat near the shadowy top of the building. Smiley studies the door. He runs his fingers over the door-frame and there it is - a little WEDGE at the top. 
51   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   51 
Guillam, followed by Smiley, pushes in against a mound of dead mail. 
They advance cautiously into the dirty flat, the windows fogged out with Windowlene. 
THEIR P.O.V. - TRACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR 
Guillam has reached the DOOR and disappears into the room beyond... 
Kaspar opens the door and walks in, finding... the office empty. 
Then a faint noise. He works his way around the desk, finds Guillam crouched down, his back to him. 
KASPAR (Suspicious) Sorry Peter, didn't know you were doing... whatever you were doing...? 
Guillam straightens up to reveal his hand oozing blood from a cut. 
PETER GUILLAM Trying not to bleed to death. Fawley's got a first aid kit in one of his drawers. Get me a plaster will you? 
Kaspar busies himself with the first-aid. Eyes hard. 
60   INT. CIRCUS - LIFTS - DAY                                   60 
Guillam has just stepped into the lift. Roy Bland appears suddenly and steps in beside him. 
Silence for a moment as they descend... 
ROY BLAND (without looking at him) Heard you had an accident. 
Guillam makes a mental note against Kaspar. 
PETER GUILLAM Cut it on a drawer handle. (Beat) When are we going to get some new furniture round here? 
ROY BLAND I'll have a word with Esterhase, Peter. We'll make it a priority on the top floor. 
They arrive on the ground floor. Bland walks out ahead. Guillam exhales with relief. Then... 
ROY BLAND (CONT'D) (as he walks away) Where are you off to? 
PETER GUILLAM Lunch. 
ROY BLAND Want some company? 
61   INT. PUB - DAY                                              61 
The two men sit drinking at a table in a nearly deserted local bar. 
ROY BLAND Tell you the truth, I'm in no hurry to get back up there... 
PETER GUILLAM Smothered by the Mothers. 
ROY BLAND Something like that. Those old birds, all pining for Control. Percy still can't get a decent cup of tea out of them. Still, I imagine it takes time. 
PETER GUILLAM What does? 
ROY BLAND Loyalty. 
He takes a pull of his pint. 
ROY BLAND (CONT'D) If it was up to me, I'd replace them all with those `naice' girls from registry. Like to hear a few high heels about the place. 
He reaches suddenly for Guillam's coat, lying on the seat - his hand heading for the pocket that holds the SUBMINIATURE CAMERA. 
ROY BLAND (CONT'D) Scrounge a fag? 
PETER GUILLAM (Quickly) Here. 
He pushes his cigarettes into Bland's hand before he can fish in the coat. Bland smokes for a moment. 
ROY BLAND (Suddenly) What do you think of Datsuns? 
PETER GUILLAM What? 
ROY BLAND Datsuns. Just got one. Wife made me. Hatchback. Caught sight of myself in it, driving past a shop window and I thought to myself "Who's that old fucker?" 
He stares at Guillam with faint smile, but his eyes are cold and watchful. 
ROY BLAND (CONT'D) What are you driving? 
PETER GUILLAM Citroen. 
ROY BLAND French? Ooh la la... 
He continues to stare at Guillam with the faint smile, and Guillam feels a sickening wave of paranoia. 
ROY BLAND (CONT'D) Drink up and I'll drop you back. You've probably got some girl waiting... 
62    INT. GUILLAM'S FLAT - NIGHT                                  62 
Guillam sits alone at the table reading a newspaper. After a moment, a man, his lover - RICHARD - a decade or so older - walks behind him, stroking his hair tenderly, and joins him at the table. Guillam automatically checks the window - the flat opposite, a lit window - could someone see them? He gets up and closes the curtains, settles back at the table, passing Richard a section of the paper. The two sit in domestic contentment, reading. 
62A   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - NIGHT                                    62A 
SMILEY'S P.O.V. - LOOKING DOWN FROM A WINDOW 
A ministerial car pulls up and Lacon climbs out. 
63    INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                     63 
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) There's Control himself, you behind him, as usual... 
A younger bespectacled Smiley, lost amongst his more glamorous colleagues. She traces other faces with a crooked finger. 
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) (Fondly) Jim Prideaux... and Bill Haydon. Together of course. The Inseparables. All my boys. That was a good time, George. 
SMILEY (Chiding) It was the war, Connie. 
CONNIE SACHS A real war. Englishmen could be proud then. 
She stares at the photograph with a sad smile. 
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) I was right, then? About Polyakov. There's a mole? 
Smiley doesn't answer, stands up to go. 
CONNIE SACHS (CONT'D) If it's bad, don't come back. I want to remember you all as you were. 
76   EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT                                      76 
The house we saw in the title sequence. The air duct opens on the front of the house, spilling out its star-shape of light. 
After a moment Polyakov walks up to the door and knocks. We hear the dog barking... 
77   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                       77 
Mrs McCraig opens the door for him and he passes her with a smile, heading upstairs. 
We TRACK with Mrs McCraig as she walks back to her pantry, opens a cupboard to reveal a huge reel to reel TAPE RECORDER. With ancient fingers she presses down the clunky record button and the spools begin to revolve. 
POLYAKOV (O.S.) (In Russian) ... The Priest is surprised to see General Secretary Krushchev... 
78   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                       78 
As we saw it in the titles. The Mystery Man sits at the table holding up pages of a document for Polyakov who is photographing them as he talks, the camera giving a satisfying CLICK and WHIR with each shot. 
POLYAKOV ... He says "Father, father, I've just had sex with two 17 year old girls." The Priest says "That's quite a sin, but you're an Atheist, General Secretary..." 
HIGH ANGLE - the dusty candelabra above their heads, and the tint MICROPHONE, nestled beside one of the bulbs. 
POLYAKOV (CONT'D) "... why are you telling me?" 
79   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT                       79 
... spools churning silently. 
POLYAKOV (O.S.) ... Krushchev says "I'm seventy- seven, I'm telling everyone." 
We hear his chuckle and the continued CLICK WHIR of the camera. 
80   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                     80 
Smiley sits at his desk staring at the CHESS SET laid out before him. One of the pieces has had the photograph of POLYAKOV added to it. 
He begins to register the faint noises around him... Pigeons on the ledge outside the window, the television mast creaking on the roof above him... 
He hears footsteps approaching down the corridor and stop outside his room. He crosses to the door and opens it and finds CONTROL waiting for him. 
CONTROL Step into my lair. 
And in an instant we are in... 
81   INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - PAST                  81 
Control is at the HEAD OF THE TABLE. Ranged against him are PERCY ALLELINE, ROY BLAND and TOBY ESTERHASE- all a little nervous. BILL HAYDON sits to the side, feet up. Smiley joins them without his spectacles. Control throws him a FILE. 
CONTROL (To Smiley) Sit down and take a look at this nonsense. 
Smiley sits down and begins to read. 
CONTROL (CONT'D) Report by Soviet High Command on their recent naval exercises in the Black Sea. Just what the Admiralty have been begging us for some information on. 
SMILEY (Engrossed) Where did you get it? 
CONTROL I didn't. Percy and his little cabal walked in with it. 
TOBY ESTERHASE (Protesting "cabal") Control... 
CONTROL Shut up, Esterhase. 
Control waves him down. Smiley considers the report dispassionately. 
SMILEY If it's genuine it's gold-dust. (Beat) But its topicality makes it suspect. 
Control turns to Alleline, with a mocking smile. 
CONTROL Smiley is suspicious, Percy. Smells a fake. 
SMILEY Where does it come from? What's the access? 
He takes another sip of tea, gazes at Mendel thoughtfully. 
84   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PLAYING FIELDS - DAY                 84 
Prideaux is running around the track, pounding along with his odd, loping stride. A group of BOYS watch him pass. One - SPIKELEY - mimics the run to the amusement of the others. 
85   INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                      85 
A fire burns in the little grate. 
ROACH sits near the back of the class. The BOY behind slaps the back of his neck with a ruler. Roach flinches but doesn't say anything. The Boy does it again. 
Prideaux drops a pile of books onto the desk of a boy - SPIKELY. 
PRIDEAUX Hand those out. 
He crosses to the board begins to write on it - JE M'APPELLE MONSIEUR ELL... 
Behind him Spikely hands out the books, continuing to walk like a HUNCHBACK. 
The class snigger. Prideaux hears but doesn't turn, continues writing. 
Then from the CHIMNEY comes an unnerving SCRABBLING sound. A little soot falls... 
The sniggering fades out as all eyes turn nervously to the fire... what is that noise? 
Then, with a terrifying SCREECH, an OWL drops down into the grate, thrashes in the flames before flapping out into the class, its wings now ON FIRE, shrieking hideously, headed straight for Spikely who stands frozen in shock as the bird swoops towards his face. 
Then... 
... somehow, Prideaux is THERE and grabs the burning bird from the air and in a second has it folded in on itself, NECK SNAPPED, and strides out of the room with it. 
The boys stare after their new teacher in SHOCKED SILENCE. 
86   EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY             86 
Roach is hiding, spying down on the caravan below, where Prideaux sits in the doorway, massaging his raised shoulder, and drinking something from a green beaker. 
PRIDEAUX (After a moment) Come down here. 
Frightened, Roach obeys, sliding down the dip to him. Prideaux examines him fiercely. Finally his face relaxes a little. 
PRIDEAUX (CONT'D) (Identifying him) Boy with the marble. 
ROACH Yes sir. 
PRIDEAUX Gave me a turn up there, parked on the horizon. Thought you were a Juju man. What's your name? 
BILL ROACH Sir, Roach, sir. Bill. I'm a new boy. 
PRIDEAUX New arrival, eh? Middle of year? What's the story? 
Roach hesitates. 
BILL ROACH (Blushing) My mother and father... my father's left, so... 
He doesn't know how to explain his misery any further. Prideaux pretends not to notice. 
PRIDEAUX Bill? The unpaid Bill. Anyone ever call you that? 
BILL ROACH No sir. 
PRIDEAUX Known a lot of Bills. They've all been good `uns. What you good at? 
Roach tries desperately to think of something. 
BILL ROACH Nothing sir. 
The boy's eyes start to MIST UP. Prideaux looks down, busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt. 
PRIDEAUX You're a good watcher though eh? Us loners always are. No one else spotted me when I turned up here. Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as he's got his specs on. Right? 
BILL ROACH (Gratefully) Yes sir. 
Prideaux finishes his drink, nods to Roach. 
PRIDEAUX Free period, isn't it? Don't waste it down here. 
Roach sets off up the dip. He looks back and sees Prideaux has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to him, rubbing his aching shoulder. 
87   EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    87 
Smiley walks up to the steps of his home, stops, examining the door, his absent-minded air hardening into something more ALERT. He scans the step and stoops to pick something up. A WEDGE. 
88   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    88 
Smiley walks into the hallway senses alert. He pads towards the drawing room, wipes sweat from his hands on his trousers, steels himself. Is it finally Them, come for him? He walks in and finds... 
89   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    89 
HER P.O.V. - 
RICKI TARR standing at the window opposite, knowing he should turn away, but somehow snagged by that look. 
A moment between the two. Then a car sweeps past on the road below and there's a flash of light behind Ricki's head - the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible BINOCULARS. Irina absorbs this. Above everything else, anger at her humiliation being observed. 
94    EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                        94 
RICKI TARR'S P.O.V. 
As Irina walks back out of the bathroom, picks up a vase and hurls it at Boris, just missing him. He stubs out his cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed. As we watch he draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring our view. Seconds later the curtains billow as Irina is thrown against them. We watch as her shape is rolled along the window by the force of Boris' blows. Finally the billowing fabric settles. Moments later Boris opens the curtains again and starts to dress. Irina lies on the bed. 
94A   EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                      94A 
RICKI'S P.O.V. 
Ricki watches the street below as Boris, Sergei and Ivan exit the hotel, head for a night out. 
Tarr pulls on his own jacket, grabs his knife. 
95    OMITTED                                                      95 
96    EXT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT                                        96 
IRINA'S P.O.V. - Her husband and the Minders are heading for a row of gaudy nightclubs. And someway behind him, Ricki Tarr, trailing. 
She exhales a breath on the glass. 
96A   EXT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT                         96A 
Tarr approaches the night club, glancing around quickly before slipping inside. 
97    INT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT                           97 
Ricki Tarr enters. He scans the room for Boris, spotting Tufty Thesinger at a table. He crosses towards him, watching as Boris and the two minders are entertained by the clubs hostesses. 
Boris calls for more drinks, clutching a bundle of currency. 
TUFTY THESINGER (grinning) This is going to be a long night. 
RICKI TARR You baby-sit this one. 
Ricki walks towards us. 
98    INT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                        98 
Irina answers the door and finds Ricki Tarr outside. 
RICKI TARR Your bloke's a bit of a bastard. (Beat) Just wanted to check you were alright. 
She stares at him. 
RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D) There was something about her. 
99    OMITTED                                                      99 
100   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY - PRESENT                         100 
Tarr exhales smoke. Smiley studies him. 
SMILEY You were due to fly home the next day. What did you tell London? 
RICKI TARR Nothing. Didn't have anything to tell yet. But... I could sense it in her. 
SMILEY Sense what? 
RICKI TARR A secret. 
101   INT. ISTANBUL - GARAGE - DAY - PAST                         101 
Ricki Tarr is talking to a man. A sports car lies under a sheet. The deal concluded, the man pulls back the sheet to reveal the car. 
102   EXT. ISTANBUL - DOCKS - DAY                                 102 
Irina is driving, exhilarated, free. Ricki Tarr is on the back seat, sleeping. 
103    INT. ISTANBUL - WORKERS CANTEEN - DAY                       103 
A workers canteen on the Bosphorus. Tarr and Irina sit drinking wine, talking. 
RICKI TARR (V.O.) I played the businessman, Michael Trench. A Holiday Romance. Thought I'd take my time with it... 
Tarr gently traces a bruise on Irina's arm. 
RICKI TARR (V.O.) (CONT'D) But second date she made this open play... 
We see a growing attraction between them. 
Irina and Tarr laughing, flirting. They move closer to one another. 
SMILEY And what did your message say, Ricki? 
RICKI TARR Just that I had a Moscow Centre trained hood wanting to defect. 
SMILEY What else? 
Tarr looks at him. For the first time there's something else behind his smile. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) I understand how you felt. You wanted to do something. 
RICKI TARR I know what I am to the Circus. One of the scalp-hunters. Someone to give the dirty jobs to. I wanted to bring this one in myself. 
SMILEY Yes. I quite see that. 
RICKI TARR I said that she claimed to have information crucial to the well- being of the Circus. 
SMILEY (O.S) And what else? 
RICKI TARR That she had information concerning a Double Agent. 
He colours. 
RICKI TARR (CONT'D) I was just trying to... to get the proper attention. (Beat) And I told them to tell Mister Guillam that this was the reason I hadn't come home, not because I'd defected or anything. 
SMILEY What happened next Ricki? 
RICKI TARR I waited for a reply. 
112   INT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - NIGHT - PAST         112 
A tense Tarr sits waiting for a reply. It's dark outside. Thesinger is asleep at his desk. The TICKER MACHINE begins to rattle into life. Tarr jumps to it. 
Tarr begins to decode the in-coming message on a one-time pad. 
INSERT - "We read you" 
RICKI TARR (V.O.) I waited hours but that was all they sent. It didn't make sense. Like they were stalling. 
113   EXT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                    113 
Tarr stands staring across at Irina's hotel balcony with binoculars. 
114   EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                       114 
BORIS stands looking straight at him. The hint of a mocking smile. Behind him we can just see SERGEI and IVAN sitting in the room. 
115   INT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT                       115 
Boris turns from the balcony, exhaling smoke from a cigarette, the faint smile still on his lips. He looks up, his expression CHANGING. 
116   EXT. ISTANBUL - ALLEYWAY - DAWN                             116 
Tarr bolts down an alleyway. 
117   INT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - DAY                  117 
The door is ajar... a radio is playing LOUD POP MUSIC. Tarr pauses on the threshold, senses alert. He takes out his KNIFE. 
118   INT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - DAY                  118 
A fan stirs the dusty air. Tarr walks in and stops. Tufty lies on the floor, in a pool of blood. He's been tortured, one eye gouged out. The other manages to convey a rather touching amazement at the violence worked on him. His throat has been slit wide open. Tarr absorbs this, looks at the knife in his own hand, turns and runs. 
119   INT. ISTANBUL - WORKERS CANTEEN - DAY                       119 
A desperate Tarr hurries towards a phone. 
120   INT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - DAY                         120 
P.O.V. - BATHROOM THROUGH THE HALF-OPEN DOOR - 
Irina enters the hotel room. She stops a moment, afraid. Then she looks towards us. 
BATHROOM 
Irina is backing out of the room. We catch a glimpse of the BUTCHERED REMAINS of BORIS hanging from the shower rail, a garroting wire around his neck. He's been tortured, the shower curtain used to catch the pooling blood. 
She BACKS AWAY across the room to the door, leaving a trail of bloody footprints on the pale carpet. 
She turns to the door, looks out of the SPY HOLE. 
Her P.O.V. - two men, TINY DISTORTED FIGURES walking down the corridor towards her. 
The phone starts to RING. Irina glances at it, knowing it's too late for her. 
SPY-HOLE - The TWO FIGURES loom closer. 
121   INT. ISTANBUL - PORT AUTHORITY - DAY                        121 
P.O.V. - Crowds of people throng the busy port. 
Alleline tries to smile. 
PERCY ALLELINE I followed the recipe. 
He glances nervously at his wife, a vivacious alcoholic, just beginning to make a show of herself. She puts a CROWN- SHAPED party hat from the cracker onto Alleline's head. He brushes it off, anxious not to appear the fool. 
PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D) (Muttering) For God's sake Mary... 
BILL HAYDON, wearing a crown from the cracker at a rakish angle, appears in the nick of time, leads Alleline's wife out for a dance, teasing the sullenness from her. They're good dancers. Alleline relieved, crisis averted. 
129A   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - NIGHT                    129A 
We find Smiley trapped in a conversation with an earnestly drunk deb. Control raises his arm above the melee. He's still at the punch bowl. 
CONTROL Smiley? Where's Ann? Get me a lady of taste? Ann will sort it out. 
SMILEY (grateful to get away from the deb) I'll go find her. 
Smiley threads his way through the party, walking amongst his colleagues, enjoying himself... Jerry Westerby and Connie Sachs are arm in arm, singing along to a song - "The Second Worst Spy in the World." They link Smiley to them for a verse, others joining in around them. The song segues into the Russian National Anthem. The crowd sing lustily, many of them Russian-speaking, enjoying the chance to sing with vigour. 
Smiley walks on. Behind him the song ends to be replaced by the CHARLIE RICH song we heard earlier. 
His P.O.V. - 
- One of the larger Mothers doubled up with laughter, pulling a cracker with a flushed TOBY ESTERHASE, hopelessly outweighed, but competitive to the finish. 
- ROY BLAND with his plain wife, eyeing one of the pretty debs as she dances by. A mother takes Smiley by the hand and leads him briefly into the dance. Smiley takes a turn with her, and extricates himself. Still smiling... 
130    INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR PARTY - CORRIDOR - NIGHT          130 
... he walks down a dark corridor, the noise of the party fading away behind him. 
He stops seeing something in the shadows of an office. For a moment he doesn't understand what he's seen. 
REVERSE 
Two shapes locked in an embrace. 
Smiley stands, nakedly absorbing the body blow. Then he turns and walks back to the heat and noise of the party. 
131   EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY - PRESENT                        131 
Smiley and Guillam sit on a bench. Smiley has his towel, hair wet from his swim. 
PETER GUILLAM You look tired. 
Smiley considers telling Guillam about Tarr's visit, but an instinct for secrecy wins out. 
SMILEY Yes. I didn't sleep well. (Beat) I want you to get something for me, Peter. I need the duty officer's log book for last November. I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to send you up a floor, into the Lion's den. (Beat) If you have the slightest reservation... 
PETER GUILLAM Is feeling sick to your stomach a slight reservation? 
SMILEY If you're caught, Peter, you can't mention me. I'm sorry, but you're alone. 
Guillam nods. He gets up and walks quickly away. After a moment a MAN rises from a nearby bench and saunters over. It's Mendel. 
MENDEL You're clean. Nothing on your back. Nothing on your conscience. 
132   EXT. CIRCUS - MORNING                                       132 
A LORRY roars past, wiping frame and revealing Guillam arriving at the circus, carrying his briefcase. He springs up the four steps. 
133   INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY                      133 
Guillam is at the security gate at the dingy lobby. The security guard, Bryant, steps from his box. Beyond him is the row of lifts. 
BRYANT Mister Guillam? How's the family? 
PETER GUILLAM Fine, Bryant. Up to Registry today. 
BRYANT Okay sir. Yellow one for the bag sir. 
Bryant stamps a PINK chit and hands it to Guillam, pulling open the lift cage. He gives him a yellow slip for the bag. 
Guillam climbs inside and begins to ascend, rattlingly slowly. As Bryant's head disappears... 
PETER GUILLAM Time you oiled this thing, isn't it? 
BRYANT (O.S.) We keep asking... 
Guillam examines the chit. He wipes his hands. For the first time we realize how NERVOUS he is. 
Polished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the uniform trousers of a short man. A self-important JANITOR. 
Guillam steps out and the Janitor checks Guillam's pink and yellow chit and motions him through a turnstile. Then he stops him short. He gestures for Guillam to raise his arms. 
PETER GUILLAM You're kidding? 
JANITOR PETE New rules. 
JANITOR ALWYN Outside line, sir. Someone rough. The garage, I think, regarding your car. 
Guillam walks over to the counter, the stolen file hugged to his chest. 
A LOCKED BOX on a trolley is wheeled towards him and is opened to reveal the OUTSIDE LINE TELEPHONE. 
PETER GUILLAM (into the phone) Hello? (Beat) Well, damn. Can't you do the bloody repair? 
138   EXT. GARAGE - DAY                                           138 
Mendel is using the office phone, an ELDERLY GERMAN MECHANIC, stands outside guarding the office door. In the background a POP TUNE is playing on the radio. 
MENDEL Can't be done sir, you're going to need a new gear box. 
139   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                          139 
On Guillam... 
PETER GUILLAM At least get on to the main dealers first... 
140   INT. CIRCUS - MONITOR ROOM - DAY                          140 
One of the Mothers is listening routinely in on the call, TAPE SPOOLS revolving, recording the conversation. The POP TUNE plays, insidiously working its way into her head. She idly taps her pen along to the tune. 
PETER GUILLAM (O.S.) Have you got the number? 
141   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                          141 
PETER GUILLAM Well, hold on... 
He cups his hand over the mouthpiece... 
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) ... Alwyn? Chuck me the bag a minute, will you? 
Alwyn gets Guillam's bag and brings it over to him. 
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) Thanks. 
Alwyn goes back to his post. Guillam, still hugging the phone, takes out a BEIGE file from his bag and switches it with the one against his chest. He takes an address book from the bag and finds a number. 
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) (Into phone) 946-0335. OK? Thanks. 
He hangs up, hands the bag back to Alwyn and steps back into... 
142   INT. CIRCUS - READING ROOM - DAY                          142 
Guillam retraces his steps, placing his dummy file in the pink stack, replacing the one he placed there in its original shelf, remembering to take the green slip from the bracket. It's done. 
Guillam takes the green slip and hands it to Sal, who signs it and puts it on its spike. Guillam turns. 
TOBY ESTERHASE is standing in front of him. Unfriendly eyes. 
TOBY ESTERHASE Could we see you Peter? 
For a second Guillam can't speak. 
TOBY ESTERHASE (CONT'D) Percy would like quite an urgent word with you. Can you come now to the fifth floor? That would be so kind. 
PETER GUILLAM Of course. 
Esterhase turns and Guillam, mind whirring, follows him back out through the counter. 
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) (to Alwyn, inspired) You might just throw that into the lift for me, mark it for the second floor, save me filling out more bloody chits? 
JANITOR ALWYN Will do sir. 
143   INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - OUTSIDE ALLELINE'S OFFICE - DAY 
The Mothers sit over their typewriters as Guillam and Esterhase walk through into the anteroom. 
PERCY ALLELINE (O.S.) (shouting from the other room) Esterhase, I'll have no phone calls, tell them... 
TOBY ESTERHASE The Chief will take no calls, please, ladies... 
MOTHER (Muttering) We can hear. 
Toby holds the door open for Guillam. 
TOBY ESTERHASE We are having a conference. 
144   INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                         144 
Alleline sits in the baronial chair, Bland at his left. Haydon on his right. Esterhase trots over to his seat. Guillam takes in the REPORT they all seem to have spread out in front of them. 
PERCY ALLELINE (Reading) Well now young Peter Guillam, are you ready for me finally? 
Guillam, affecting ease, leans against the wall. 
PERCY ALLELINE (CONT'D) What are you getting up to down there these days, apart from chasing our virgins... 
PETER GUILLAM (To Smiley) He's a double, George! There is no Mole! The whole thing's a pack of lies thought up by Moscow. Karla's bought him for thirty thousand pounds! 
He pulls the LOG BOOK out of his file. 
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) (To Tarr) I stole that, because of you! I spied on my own. Do you know how that makes me feel? 
Smiley holds out his hand for the log book. 
SMILEY As you did take the trouble to steal it... 
Guillam hands him the book and Smiley leafs through the pages. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) Ricki, you said you sent the Circus a telegram concerning Irina's information? 
Tarr sits up, wiping blood from his mouth. 
RICKI TARR (Sullenly) S'right. 
SMILEY What was the date? 
Tarr hesitates, considering. 
PETER GUILLAM He doesn't know because there was no telegram! The whole thing... 
RICKI TARR November 20th. It would have been November 20th. Evening. 
Smiley has found the right month. He flicks through the dated pages - 18th November, 19th November... 
He holds up the book - the next page has been cut out. 
SMILEY November 20th is missing. (Beat) Someone is covering their tracks Peter. Unless you think that's just a coincidence? 
Guillam looks thrown. 
PETER GUILLAM What about the money? 
SMILEY Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him. 
Guillam takes the log book from Smiley, runs a thumb down the razored edge of the missing page. He notices some writing on the next page. 
PETER GUILLAM (Reading) "Enquiries to the fifth floor." 
Smiley takes the book again, examines the note. 
SMILEY You recognize that handwriting? (Beat) That's Toby Esterhase. 
149   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - EVENING                                  149 
Smiley and Guillam pull up in front of the hotel. They sit, in weary silence, staring up at the unprepossessing building. 
PETER GUILLAM Why didn't you tell me? That you had Tarr? 
Smiley looks at him. Guillam reads the look correctly. 
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) In case I didn't make it out of the Circus... 
SMILEY Secrecy is a habit. 
Guillam rubs his eyes. 
PETER GUILLAM I should get some rest. And I suppose you should get your reading done. 
Smiley nods. Doesn't move. 
150   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                    150 
The two men are finishing off a bottle of Scotch. Unusually, Smiley is drunk - a result of the alcohol and the lack of sleep. 
Guillam lies on one of the single beds, staring at the PHOTOGRAPHS of the four suspects Smiley has pinned on his chessmen. 
PETER GUILLAM I'm sorry. 
SMILEY What for? 
PETER GUILLAM I wanted to believe Tarr was lying. (Beat) All this time, thinking I'm fighting a war. It's a sham. Karla won years ago and we didn't even know it. 
Smiley watches Guillam, estimating how badly all of this is affecting him. 
SMILEY (Beat) I met him once. Karla. (MORE) 
SMILEY (CONT'D) In fifty-five. Moscow Centre was in pieces. Purge after purge. Half their Agents were jumping ship and I travelled around signing them up. Hundreds of them. 
Guillam raises himself up on an elbow, listening. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) One of them was calling himself Gerstmann. He was on his way back to Russia, and we were pretty sure he was going to be executed. Plane had a twenty-four lay over at Delhi, and that's how long I had to convince him to come over to us instead of going home to die. 
Smiley stares at the room around, projecting his memory of the Delhi cell onto their present surroundings. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) Little room...I'm sitting here...he's sitting there... 
Smiley is distant... 
SMILEY The Saville. 
PETER GUILLAM At one-thirty? The ticker-tape wouldn't be running. 
Guillam sits, mind racing. 
PETER GUILLAM (CONT'D) So how did he know? Oh Jesus, George... 
SMILEY Peter... 
PETER GUILLAM Jesus Christ. Haydon? How could he have known? 
SMILEY It's not him, Peter. 
PETER GUILLAM Then how did he know? 
SMILEY (gently) Because he was at my house that night. With Ann. 
Guillam doesn't know what to say. They sit in a hideously awkward silence. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) (of the Hamburger) I quite like this. 
167A   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT - PAST            167A 
The phone on the nightstand starts to ring. A woman's hand reaches into frame and picks it up. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hello? (beat) Oh hello Jerry. No I'm afraid George isn't back yet. 
In the bed beside her we see Bill Haydon. 
168    EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT                                 168 
A black Cab pulls up at the lights. Another black cab pulls alongside it. The two drivers acknowledge each other, chatting as the lights change to RED, but in no hurry to move. 
An impatient woman passenger flicks a look at the passenger in the opposite cab, wanting to share this moment of passenger outrage. 
We see ALLELINE'S profile staring stonily ahead. 
We follow his cab as it peels off into a FAMILIAR street, driving towards the house where we met Polyakov. 
169    EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY                                  169 
Smiley slips into the water. It's late afternoon. Very still and calm. Very few swimmers. Smiley's head breaks the surface, dips in, breaks the surface... 
170    EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY                                  170 
Smiley sits on a platform with his back to us, drying off from his swim, looking out over the water. A MAN'S HEAD appears, swimming up to the platform through the reeds. An old QUEEN, his face almost purple with the cold. He clings to the edge of the platform for a moment. 
OLD MAN Just in case it's of interest, dear. We are observed. Old Filth in the bushes. Not very subtle but there you are... 
He swims away. The wind lifts up a little, rustling the trees and bushes around the pond. We stay on Smiley, watched and alone.

174   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   174 
Smiley walks into his hallway, picks up the MAIL piled on the floor. He crosses to the drawing room, still looking at the mail. 
The door is a little ajar and through the opening we catch a FLASH of movement in the room beyond - a COUPLE in a passionate embrace, glimpsed for a moment before they disappear out of sight. We can hear what may be their love- making. And a RECORD IS PLAYING. The same CHARLIE RICH track Smiley reacted to in the Islay Hotel. 
Smiley stares at the mail in his hand as if unwilling to look up. 
He pushes open the door and moves into... 
175   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   175 
... which is EMPTY. He sits in an armchair, starts opening some letters. 
A FIGURE walks past Smiley abruptly. Smiley doesn't look up. 
BILL HAYDON (O.S.) Good flight? 
Smiley looks up. 
BILL HAYDON sits in the armchair opposite in shirt and trousers, SOCKS, NO SHOES. He sips a cup of tea. No sense of having been caught in an act of adultery. 
176   INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY - PAST                            176 
BACK ON SMILEY 
... who is now wearing a raincoat and we realise we are in fractured memories of... 
THE PAST 
Something in his manner alerts Prideaux. 
PRIDEAUX What else? 
CONTROL (Beat) Treasure. He has treasure. The name of the Mole Moscow Centre has planted at the top of the Circus. 
Prideaux's face doesn't change, but he's wondering if the rumours could be true and Control really has gone mad. 
CONTROL (CONT'D) There's a rotten apple Jim and we have to find it. 
Laboriously he leans forward to the CHESS SET. 
CONTROL (CONT'D) I'm   so close I can almost feel his   heart beating. I know it's one   of five men. All I want from you   is one word. 
He points to the PHOTOGRAPH of PERCY ALLELINE. 
CONTROL (CONT'D) Alleline - Tinker. (Points at the next photo) Haydon - Tailor. Bland - Soldier. We drop Sailor, it's too close to Tailor. (Pointing at next photo) Esterhase - Poorman. 
182   INT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - NIGHT - PRESENT                      182 
Prideaux sits with his visitor - Smiley -      recalling the meeting. He's drinking vodka. 
SMILEY Which means I was...? 
PRIDEAUX You were Beggarman. 
Smiley nods. Just a flicker of the eyes shows us that this is painful for him to hear. 
SMILEY What did you make of it, Jim? Control's theory? 
PRIDEAUX (Stiff) I thought it was madness. To think any one of you could have been a traitor... madness. 
Smiley is watching him intently - sure he's hiding something. 
SMILEY But still you went? Risking your life for a mission you thought was absurd? Why? 
Prideaux doesn't answer. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) Perhaps some part of you wanted to know if Control was right? Wanted to know if there was a Mole, who it might be? 
Prideaux shoots him a dangerous look. 
PRIDEAUX (Hard) I went because Control asked me to go. It's called doing one's duty. 
183   INT. BUDAPEST - TRAIN STATION - DAY - PAST                  183 
Prideaux climbs off his train and walks down the platform towards us. He pauses for a moment, drawing a Hungarian newspaper from his pocket. As he does so he glances at the other passengers walking past him. TWO WOMEN and a MAN, all apparently travelling alone, the SHOES they're wearing - BROWN SUEDE BOOTS, FUR LINED BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS and the man - a pair of BLACK GALOSHES. 
Prideaux walks on, tapping the paper against his leg. 
184   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                               184 
The scene from the opening of the film. The Waiter puts down Prideaux's plate, a drop of sweat from his forehead hitting the table. He looks at the droplet, fakes a smile for the Magyar, looks after the Waiter, scans the floor around him... 
HIS P.O.V. - There it is - one of the women is wearing the BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS. Her coat is different and she's wearing a fur hat now - but the shoes are the one thing the surveillance agents don't have time to change. 
Prideaux glances up at the apartment windows above, sees the old woman, starts to rise... as we CUT TO: 
The SHOT - 
... punching into his back, Prideaux falling forward... as we CUT TO: 
PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. 
Those shoes again, stepping in the water and blood on the floor, passing us at eye-level. Grouping and regrouping as the operation comes to an end. The noise in the background comes to us muted and very faint. Faintly, a baby is crying, an ambulance siren is wailing. 
Hands appear and we are rolled onto a stretcher and lifted up to chest level where we seem to FLOAT past the faces of the MAGYAR and the other Officers, smoking cigarettes by the doors, and out towards the open doors of a waiting ambulance. 
185   INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY                               185 
We are slid into the back of the ambulance as though into the drawers of a morgue. And snap to BLACK. 
186   INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CELL - DAY                           186 
We are looking at the back of Prideaux's head, hair damp with sweat, shoulders trembling. 
We PULL OUT and find Prideaux, a filthy dressing covering the wound on his back. The cell he is in has filthy, heavily padded walls, like a straitjacket. From a speaker in the ceiling comes a maddening jagged drone. Lights blaze down... 
SMILEY (V.O.) What did you tell them? 
187   INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CORRIDOR - DAY                       187 
Prideaux, in too much pain to walk, is being dragged down a brightly lit corridor towards an INTERROGATION ROOM at the far end. 
He is taken inside, the door closed behind him. 
PRIDEAUX (V.O.) Everything. 
188   INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT         188 
193   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - GUILLAM'S CAR - NIGHT - PRESENT          193 
P.O.V. - THROUGH WINDSCREEN 
... rain lashes down, obscuring our view. 
PRIDEAUX (V.O.) Do you know who she was? 
SMILEY (V.O.) (Cold) Nobody you need concern yourself with. An unfortunate... 
REVERSE - we see Guillam and Smiley are sitting in the parked car in the rain. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) He said when he got out, when he was being debriefed at the Nursery, he had a visitor. 
PETER GUILLAM Who? 
SMILEY Toby Esterhase. 
194   EXT. SARRATT - DAY - PAST                                  194 
... Prideaux stands watching a small, dapper figure crossing the grounds towards him - TOBY ESTERHASE. A man who's come up in the world. 
195   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - GUILLAM'S CAR - NIGHT - PRESENT         195 
SMILEY He gave him a thousand pounds. Told him he was dead now and couldn't come back. Had to become a Lotus Eater - forget everything that happened - Control's theory, Tinker, Tailor... all of it. 
Guillam stares at him, ALERT. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) Yes, that's what I thought. How on earth did Esterhase hear about "Tinker, Tailor?" 
196   EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - NIGHT                                   196 
Smiley gets out of the car, into the rain. Looks around him, uneasy. 
PETER GUILLAM You alright? 
SMILEY Will you watch my back, Peter? Look out for a solo. Just a feeling I've had. 
PETER GUILLAM Yes, George. I'll watch. 
Guillam watches as Smiley heads off into the gloom. 
197   INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - NIGHT                   197 
Smiley stares at the CHESS BOARD - a complex pattern of related figures. 
He turns back to the tape-deck, puts the headphones on, presses play: 
SMILEY (O.S.) (Over headphones) What exactly did Irina say? 
RICKI TARR (Over headphones) She said there was a General, work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London. And that Polyakov's real job was to service the mole. He meets him regularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla. 
Smiley presses STOP. He presses RE-WIND, watches the tape spool BACKWARDS. He goes too far, presses FAST-FORWARD, watches the tape REVERSE DIRECTION. And, at this moment, we can tell from his expression, a piece of the jig-saw falls into place. 
198   OMITTED                                                  198 
199   INT. MINISTERIAL MEETING ROOM - DAY                      199 
Lacon and Smiley are meeting with the MINISTER. 
MINISTER This meeting is not taking place. Is that clear? 
SMILEY Perfectly, Minister. (Beat) There is a house, somewhere in this city, where Alleline and the others meet Witchcraft's London representative. I need the address of that house. 
MINISTER I don't know what you're talking about. 
Smiley stares at him. 
MINISTER (CONT'D (CONT'D) I don't know the address. And I fail to see the... I thought Lacon had made it clear to you, keep your nose bloody-well out of Witchcraft's business! 
SMILEY (Calmly) It's Lacon's advice I'm following. (To Lacon) You told me to follow in Control's footsteps. 
MINISTER (Snapping) Well, I wouldn't consider that sound advice, after the bloody mess Control left us with. It's taken Alleline - and, if I may say so, myself - this long to get us back into the race. 
SMILEY I'm glad you take some of the credit. 
Lacon glances sharply at Smiley - there's something different about him, his tone... 
SMILEY (CONT'D) The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov. You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you. His real role is to receive information from the Mole to take back to Karla. 
He has the Minister's full attention now. A long silence. 
MINISTER That's... that's not possible. 
SMILEY Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that. 
MINISTER (Appalled) Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine! It's been gold! 
SMILEY Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in. 
Esterhase leaving the Circus, Bryant politely wishing him good night. 
208    EXT. ABANDONED AIRFIELD - DAY - PRESENT                     208 
... eyes fixed on the plane as it roars down towards them. 
TOBY ESTERHASE This is a mistake George, this is all... 
SMILEY The files were delivered to a Russian attache, weren't they? 
209    INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - EVENING - PAST             209

210    EXT. ABANDONED AIRFIELD - DAY - PRESENT                     210 
TOBY ESTERHASE Yes. And yes, I delivered them. 
211    EXT. SAFE HOUSE - DAY - PAST                                211 
Alleline getting out of the cab by the railings... the dog barking from inside the house... 
TOBY ESTERHASE (V.O.) ... but so did Percy...

Haydon walking past Mrs McCraig and heading up the stairs to the empty room... 
TOBY ESTERHASE ... and Bill... 
211B   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - DAY                       211B 
Roy Bland sits in front of Polyakov, holding up the documents for Polyakov to photograph - Whir... Click.... 
TOBY ESTERHASE And Roy... 
212   EXT. ABANDONED AIRFIELD - DAY - PRESENT                  212 
Esterhase can't tear his eyes away from the propeller plane descending onto the runway ahead of them. 
TOBY ESTERHASE Things aren't always what they seem. You know that George. Moscow thinks Polyakov's working for them, so, every now and then we give him the odd file to take back to them, just chicken-feed, keep his bosses happy. But Polyakov's our Joe, part of a big operation... 
SMILEY Operation Witchcraft? Yes, I know. 
Esterhase stops, turns to look at Smiley. 
TOBY ESTERHASE Why are we here? Why are we...? 
Guillam gives him a sudden VIOLENT SHOVE in the back. Esterhase straightens himself, runs a palm through his hair, real fear on his face now. 
TOBY ESTERHASE (CONT'D) I don't... I don't deserve this. I don't deserve this George! 
SMILEY Who gave you the message for Jim to forget about Tinker Tailor? 
TOBY ESTERHASE Bland! 
SMILEY To get rid of Connie Sachs? Westerby? 
TOBY ESTERHASE Bland or Haydon. I don't remember. One of them. Maybe Percy. I don't know who. 
SMILEY You're just the messenger? Running between them all. Anything to serve Witchcraft? 
Esterhase flinches again. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) I know all about your secret source. And I know something you don't. I know who he is.(Beat) He's Karla. 
Esterhase turns to look at them in horror. Guillam pushes him again. The plane has taxied to a halt ahead of them. Unmarked. Something sinister about it. 
213   OMITTED                                                     213 
214   INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - DAY - PAST                 214

215   INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - DAY                        215 
Polyakov is photographing... nothing. The table in front of him is empty, the shooting just a pantomime for the microphone above. As he continues to shoot we see the Mystery man sitting across the table from him. He takes out a canister of developed film and passes it to Polyakov. 
SMILEY (V.O.) One of you has been giving Polyakov the Crown Jewels. 
216   EXT. ABANDONED AIRFIELD - DAY - PRESENT                     216 
... standing on the airfield. 
TOBY ESTERHASE I didn't know. I swear I... 
SMILEY Are you still a wanted man, Toby? 
Toby looks back at the plane, almost hysterical. 
Smiley walks towards one of the huts, stops as Alleline walks out. Alleline, a broken man, can barely look at him. With a nod he walks on. 
244   EXT. SARRATT - NISSAN HUT - DAY                            244 
An unshaven, exhausted Haydon stands outside the Sarratt building in a small fenced enclosure. We see Smiley walking towards him. He's brought a box of cigarettes. 
245   INT. SARRATT - DAY                                         245 
Haydon is weeping quietly but without emotion. Smiley offers Haydon the box of Cigarettes. 
SMILEY I was assured there would be no coercion. 
Haydon waves it away. Smiley hands him a clean handkerchief. 
BILL HAYDON It's almost funny George. I know the Inquisitors little bag of tricks. I taught most of them. Don't mind the tears. Just a reaction. An over-reaction, if you like. Craddox says I'll be off in a few days. I keep thinking how I'm going to miss the cricket in Moscow. 
He weeps again. 
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D) I rather hoped you would do a little light house-keeping for me. 
SMILEY If I can. 
BILL HAYDON There's a girl...Would you give her some money for me? Give her a good cover story. If it helps tell her I love her. It's all here. 
SMILEY Of course. 
BILL HAYDON There's a boy too. Bung him a few quid to shut him up. Take it out of the reptile fund. 
SMILEY I did have one or two questions. About Prideaux. 
BILL HAYDON Damn it! I got him back, didn't I? 
SMILEY Yes, yes you did. That was good of you. (Beat) I'm surprised Karla didn't shoot him. Or do you think he held back out of delicacy towards you? 
No response. Smiley looks carefully at Haydon's profile. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) Did Prideaux come and see you before he left on his Hungarian mission? 
BILL HAYDON Yes, as a matter of fact he did. 
SMILEY To say what? 
Haydon stares at him. For the first time the tears seem real. Guilt and grief. He looks down. A long pause. 
SMILEY (CONT'D) (almost to himself) To warn you. Because he knew, deep down, it was you all along. 
BILL HAYDON So did you. 
Haydon stares out, lost in thought. 
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D) I had to pick a side George. It was an aesthetic choice as much as a moral one. The West has grown so very ugly, don't you think? 
Smiley doesn't answer. A moment of silence. 
SMILEY Did Karla ever consider having you take over the Circus? 
For a moment Haydon looks rattled. 
BILL HAYDON I'm not his bloody office boy. 
SMILEY What are you then? 
Haydon turns to Smiley, a flash of hauteur. 
BILL HAYDON I'm someone who made his mark. 
Smiley watches him, feeling him shrink in stature before his eyes. Haydon lights a cigarette. 
SMILEY (Quietly) Is there anything you want me to pass on to Ann? 
For a moment Haydon looks genuinely puzzled. 
BILL HAYDON Oh, that was nothing personal, George, I hope you understand that? Karla said you were good, the one we had to worry about. But you do have a blind spot. (MORE) 
BILL HAYDON (CONT'D) He reckoned if I was known to be Ann's lover you wouldn't be able to see me straight. And he was right, up to a point. 
SMILEY Up to a point. 
246   INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY                                   246 
The flat is now empty, cleared of Control's possessions. Smiley looks around, places a CHESS PIECE on the piano. We see the piece bears the name HAYDON. 
SMILEY (Quietly) "Tailor." 
He walks away. 
247   EXT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY                                   247 
George comes up his path, looking old and tired.

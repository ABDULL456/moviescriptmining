FADE IN: 
EXT. DESERT DUNES - DAWN 
CLOSE ON A WOODEN STICK-FIGURE TOY, held by a SIX YEAR OLD BOY. Another BOY grabs the toy away and RUNS OFF, laughing -- CHILDREN are playing under a cluster of date palms, part of a small desert commune somewhere in the Middle East. Their MOTHERS, veiled in black, gather and talk. Bearded, turbaned MEN carrying AK-47's argue politics. A domestic, even tranquil scene of life in another part of the world... 
EXT. DESERT ROAD - CONTINUOUS 
A CARAVAN of VEHICLES RACE DOWN A HIGHWAY:. SUV's mounted with surface-to-air RPG's form a protective cordon around a BLACK MERCEDES. As the cars ROAR INTO LENS, we go.to: 
EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN 
POV THOUGH A LONG-RANGE SCOPE: the caravan as seen by a TWO-MAN SPECIAL OPS TEAM perched on a ridge. As the LEADER surveils the cars, his partner finishes assembling a two-foot UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), rigging it with EXPLOSIVES: 
SPECIAL FORCES LEADER We have visual onthetarget. Confirm 'go' for UAV launch. 
INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - NIGHT 
SUPER: "JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER, THE PENTAGON" Sat-feeds monitor the caravan. Military brass observes: SECRETARY OF DEFENSE GEOFF CALLISTER (50's, African American; eyes with soul and a wary intelligence). Beside him: COLONEL THOMPSON (Full-Bird, decorated). 
COLONEL THOMPSON Alpha One, you're confirmed 'go': active UAV at GPS papa, zulu, three, zero. 
EXT. RIDGE ABOVE ROAD - DAWN 
The Ops Team activates a remote transmitter, LAUNCHING the UAV into the sky like a small ROCKET -- amazingly, its silent. 
INT. PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - CONTINUOUS 
An airborne feed from the UAV shows it descending on the caravan. A PENTAGON TECHIE manipulates a JOY STICK, controlling the drone from 6500 miles away: 
PENTAGON TECHIE #1 We have system control. 
CONTINUED: 
COLONEL THOMPSON Activate laser mic. 
EXT. SKIES OVER DESERT - CONTINUOUS 
DRONE POV: tracking the caravan, singling out the MERCEDES. The drone emits a THIN LASER BEAM that hits its rear windshield -- 
INT. THE PENTAGON - JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY 
Over speakers, VOICES speak "Balochi." A TRANSLATOR listens: 
CALLISTER Is it him? 
TRANSLATOR Four males, one of them's speaking with a.. I think it's a Rakhshaniâ¢dialect, consistent with our intel on Al=Khoei. 
COLONEL THOMPSON Gimme voiceprint analysis. The screen pops to an AUDIO WAVEFORM of the conversation. VOICEPRINT ANALYSIS finishes, the; screen shows a FILE PHOTO of a 
BEARDED MAN: "37% PROBABLE MATCH = ID AL-KHOEI." 
CALLISTER I'm not taking 37% to-the President... John, weigh in here? He looks to a plasma: the PRESIDENT'S CABINET is assembled via teleconference from the White House Situation Room: 
DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE CIA and NCTC concur this is the target based on reliable Intel from the Brits. WHIP TO another monitor: the caravan starts to VEER off-road. 
TECHIE Sire they're pulling off the highway. 
TECHIE #2 We have abort recommendation. The ANALYSIS ARRAY reads: "RECOINDATION: ABORT MISSION." The source of this recommendation, for now, remains a mystery. 
COLONEL THOMPSON If it's him, this guy comes out of hiding once in a lifetime, we can't let him go. 
CALLISTER (beat, torn) Alright, stay with him... 
CONTINUED: THE SATELLITE VIEW shows the caravan approaching the commune. 
EXT. DESERT COMMUNE - DAY 
Mothers grab up their children and pull them aside as the vehicles arrive. ARMED MEN emerge... INTERCUTTING - THE PENTAGON OPS ROOM: the computer pinpoints DOTS on the satellite feed that represent WEAPONRY on-site -- 
TECHIE We've got AK-47's, RPC's, Chaparral guided missiles -- 
COLONEL THOMPSON Looks like a training camp. THE DESERT: Bodyguards cluster around a TURBANED:MAN as he emerges from the Mercedes. It looks a lot like the man from the file photo, but the beard makes it hard to confirm. MID-AIR WITH THE UAV: It SWOOPS, targeting the man -- SNAP: THE PENTAGON: a BLURRY SNAPSHOT of his FACE appears. A DIGITAL WIRE-FRAME is overlaid on the man's face: "5I$ PROBABLE MATCH - 
JERRY That -- wow. Good for you. So it's your last night. You're gonna spend it collating. 
KWAME -- what? But she said the collator's broken. 
JERRY And that's why we have those rubber thimbles in the drawer --.congratulations on Cornell, though, that's huge! TRACK WITH HIM out to... A COUNTER AREA as, he pins on his NAMETAG: "JERRY." Rows of COPY MACHINES and COMPUTER CUBICLES. He takes his place behind a register. Smiles, getting it up: 
JERRY (CONT'D) Welcome to Kinko's, how can I help you? The CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK-CHUGCLICK sound of the machines gets louder and louder as they BECOME THE SOUND OF: 
INT. "EL" SUBWAY CAR - MORNING 
The KRAK-KRAK-KRACKING SUBWAY. We glimpse people looking at their BLACKBERRYS. Talking on CELL PHONES. Listening to IPODS and playing GAME BOYS. The NEWS plays on an LCD mounted on the train wall. A society lost in an "electronic elsewhere." And JERRY, with a SKETCH PAD in his lap. A surprisingly good pencil rendering of the face of a LARGE DOG -- weird, but he's got talent. The TV disturbs his concentration -- news footage of BOMBED-OUT EMBASSIES, emergency vehicles, wounded victims: 
SHEPARD SMITH a heightened terror alert due to a series of suicide bombings, believed to be in retaliation for a deadly attack outside Abadan that killed forty people. Though the White House has denied involvement, Shia leaders have denounced the U.S. as responsible... AL-JAZEERA FOOTAGE: A SHIA SPOKESMAN is translated into ENGLISH: 
CONTINUED: 
SPOKESMAN Your embassies were only the beginning! Our warriors are already within your borders. Until American leadership is removed from power, Allah's revenge is upon you! And during all this, Jerry notices something: people are glancing at each other aranoid. What a fucking world... 
EXT. ATM MACHINE - MORNING 
An ATM CARD gets slid into the slot. Jerry looks up. THE ATM CAMERA IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. Then, a BEEP gets his attention: "INSUFFICIENT FUNDS." He processes this a moment... his exhale doesn't just say, "FUCK," it says "FUCK 1 KNEW IT." 
INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LOBBY .-MORNING 
Saying it's a modest place would be kind. Jerry opens his mailbox. Just BILLS, some of which will:go unpaid this month. A BEAT as he shoves them back in and we HARD CUT TO: 
INT. JERRY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - MORNING 
A DOOR OPENS: MRS. WIERZBOWSKI, Jerry's elderly Polish landlady. Pleased to see him, but painfully annoyed to know what's coming: 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Jerry. 
JERRY Whatever are you cooking right now? Is the greatest thing I've ever smelled in my life, I swear to God -- 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI is schab wieprzowy po polsku -- you have the rent, yes? 
JERRY (puts cash in her hands) -- here's some of it -- most of it -- but I've got something else for you... something special... Eyebrows bobbing. Mrs. Wierzbowsky knows exactly what it is. Sighs. Knows she can't resist him -- 
INT. KITCHEN - MRS. WIERZBOWSKI'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
CLOSE ON Jerry pushing a THUMB TAC into the dog sketch we saw him doing on the subway. PULL BACK to reveal about 25 other sketches on the wall. All of the same dog. The actual DOG, Johann, lies underneath the kitchen table. 
CONTINUED: 
JERRY So I think. No, I'm pretty sure that's the best one so far --- 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Yes. Is good -- rent is better. She puts a bowl of STEW into Jerry's hands. 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) You are hungry, I am guessing. 
JERRY Oh, no, no. I couldn't -- (looking down at bowl) Unless, you know, you insist. He sits at the table, starts eating. This is their routine. 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI So where is girl? I don't see her? 
JERRY Oh, the redhead? No. She... that's over. She got smart. 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Like the others. 
JERRY Well, womenareIpretty smart. I've discovered. 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI You are like Johann. Jerry stops eating, mouth full. As Johann looks up. 
JERRY Your -- I'm like your dog? 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Look at him. Is big dog. Labrador. But he believe... he is terrier. So is Labrador... but no labrador. Somehow Jerry can't get his eyes off Johann. Quietly: 
JERRY why do you think that is? As she pours a drink into a plastic cup -- 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI Perhaps many things. When I rescue Johann from pound, they say he was abuse. 
(MC)RF ) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) As puppy. They kick him when baby, make him feel not big. (hands Jerry the cup) You need someone for rescuing you. Jerry looks at her, sad-smiles. Takes a sip and holy shit: 
JERRY This is -- vodka -- Jesus, its eight- thirty in the morning -- 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI -- you cannot eat bigos without vodka. Adjusting to it, Jerry drinks again -- as his CELL PHONE RINGS. He looks at his phone, freezing. Mrs. Wierzbowski notices. 
MRS. WIERZBOWSKI (CONT'D) Is the girl? Answer. Tell her you'. are Labrador. Then ask if she give you money for rent. But we've PUSHED IN on Jerry, who stares at the name on the phone. Something's affecting him deeply. He says, quietly: 
KYLE You swore again. Was that our bus? Rachel looks: PAN to across the street, the bus is now LEAVING THE BUS STOP. PAN back to Rachel: SHIT!! 
RACHEL: Okay, now were gonna.be late. She puts fingers in her mouth and WHISTLES HARD for a cab -- 
INT. TRAIN STATION - WISCONSIN - DAY 
A CLASS OF MUSIC STUDENTS boards and Amtrak train. Rachel and Kyle are RUNNING through the crowd toward them -- 
RACHEL Scuze us, coming through, sorry -- WAIT!! 
WAIT!! Finally they arrive. Kyle's teacher, MRS. MILLER, smiles: 
MRS. MILLER Under the wire -- 
RACHEL (gulping breaths) Hi -- sorry -- Rachel Holloman, we met-- 
MRS. MILLER -- of course, Barbara Miller. (looks at watch) You should probably -- And Rachel's stomach drops. Knows they've been racing towards this moment all morning but still not willing to accept it. Turning Kyle to face her -- 
CONTINUED: 
RACHEL Okay. Now. I want you to have an awesome time -- 
KYLE I will, mom -- 
RACHEL -- you can eat junk food, just remember to brush your teeth; and if you're gonna goof off, just be really smart about it; and try not to stay up past your bedtime, you get really cranky when you do that'-- (turns to Mrs. Miller) He gets very contrarian if he doesn't get at least eight -- 
MRS. MILLER I'm afraid it's time to board, Mrs. Holloman. Tears springing to Rachel's eyes. She tries to hide them. Bending down to be eye to eye with her son. Sotto -- 
RACHEL You see all these kids? They're all calling their mothers. You just do it more -- 
KYLE It's only two days,: mom. Y'know... you could try and some have fun too, wouldn't kill ya.. 
RACHEL Fun? What's that? (hugging him) I love you so much, baby.You're my everything. Rock the house. 
KYLE -- love you too -- They separate -- she watches as Kyle boards with Mrs. Miller: 
RACHEL Call me! 
MRS. MILLER Your mom gonna be okay? 
KYLE It's unclear. As they head into the train, Rachel steels herself and GOES. Passing the BAGGAGE AREA... 
CONTINUED: (2) We HOLD as the PORTER places Kyle's TRUMPET CASE on a conveyor belt. Oddly, it's ELECTRONICALLY REDIRECTED AWAY FROM THE OTHER INSTRUMENTS -- down a separate belt, where it emerges in a pick- up turnstile. Its lifted off the track by... A MIDDLE EASTERN MAN. Nervous. Really nervous. And the strangest thing -- he touches his ear and MURMURS something in Tajiki. To no one. Like a crazy person. What the hell? Walks to the curb where his white van idles. On the side is a decal: "HASSAD DRY CLEANERS." Loads the trumpet inside as we: 
INT. SHAW HOME - AFTERNOON 
Solemn quiet. Mourners talking in hushed tones. A buffet. Old people. Children. And over these shots, WHISPERED VOICES: 
WOMAN #1 (V.O.) you didn't know either? 
WOMAN #2 (V.0.) No idea. 
WOMAN #3 (V.0.) I knew he had a brother. But not a twin, that was... 
WOMAN.#1 (V.0.) I know, I know... Four WOMEN sit together. Heartbroken, unsettled. One glances across into a sitting room, where Jerry sits alone on a sofa. We're CLOSE on Jerry now. Holding a glass, etched with hearts. Looking at it as if it means something. Somehow, his childhood. He looks up at the stairs, as if knowing he needs to go up there. So he does. We MOVE with him: 
WOMAN #1 (CCNT'D) when was the last time they saw him? 
WOMAN #2 Margaret said years... 
INT. SHAW HOUSE - PAUL AND JERRY'S ROOM - DAY 
TROPHIES. RIBBONS. All of them awarded to PAUL SHAW. TIGHT on Jerry's face as he scans the shelves of evidence. Evidence that he had a brother. A superior brother. Again and again we see: PAUL SHAW. PAUL SHAW. PAUL. PAUL. Then Jerry finds one framed CERTIFICATE. In the back. A Junior High ART PRIZE. Awarded to JERRY SHAW. He smiles at the fucking absurdity of it as a figure appears behind him... 
CONTINUED: It's WILLIAM. Their father. The worst day of this man's life. Jerry composes himself quickly. They stare for a moment. 
WILLIAM Six months without a boo or a bah. 
JERRY Didn't realize it'd been that long. 
WILLIAM Your mom was worried. So where were you this time? 
JERRY Nowhere. (then, a touch reticent) Singapore. Alaska for a few weeks. got a job for a while. On a...fishing boat. Met some great p- 
WILLIAM -- that's nice. Looks like you're really seeing the world. 
JERRY I'm trying, you know, just to -- But William has just started crying.. Sobs of absolute loss. Jerry stands there, frozen, until William EMBRACES HIM. Jerry hugs him back -- tightly, grateful and starting to feel again. And just then, William says, quietly, through tears: 
WILLIAM You sound just like him. Jerry's eyes find a point in space. This is love by proxy. And now he hugs, his father in support, not unity. William pulls back. Takes his wallet from his pocket: 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) I want to give you some, uh... 
JERRY If you're asking if we were the kind of freaky twins you see at the mall wearing the same shirt, no. Listen, Paul traveled a lot, so we didn't -- 
CONTINUED: 
MORGAN Oh. That's right. He stamped visas in Karachi for a year. Then was a junior FSO in Beirut. Interesting places. 
JERRY What're you... saying. 
MORGAN I'm just saying you didn't talk much. maybe you did. 
JERRY Am I getting a lawyer here? 'Cause didn't hear my rights read to me-- 
MORGAN You familiar with the slogan, "Declare War on War?" 
JERRY what? No, why? Morgan pulls out a SURVEILLANCE PHOTO: Jerry, college-age, at a STUDENT RALLY holding up a sign with an image of the Pentagon crossed out in red: "DECLARE WAR ON WAR!" 
MORGAN Because you painted it when you were part of the student activist group "Project Underground" at Berkley. 
JERRY (stares-at pic; LAUGHS) Wait. Come on -- okay: her name was Julia, she was the smokinist girl I'd ever seen and she wanted me -- I would've gone to an "Anti-Oxygen" rally for her. I swear to God, dude-- 
MORGAN Don't "dude" me. I'm not your friend. I don't have friends... so: Jerry. Why'd you drop out of school? 
JERRY Why'd you stay in? I don't know, I didn't really see the point. 
MORGAN You haven't been able to hold a job 
JERRY Unless I've been fired from Kinko's, which is a statistical impossibility, I'm holding a job right now. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MORGAN Construction work, bartender in Singapore, telemarketing, real estate office, messenger, supermarket sign painter, taxi driver, gas station in Florida, fishing boat in Alaska-- 
JERRY -- what can I say? Guess I haven't found myself yet -- 
MORGAN Who deposited the seven-fifty? 
JERRY For as second I thought God, maybe. The ATM was obviously broken -- or do.. accidents not happen in your . universe? 
MORGAN JERRY The money originated from the --this is all -- listen, this HSBC bank of Singapore -- is all very interesting -- but opened with a transfer from a this has nothing to do with corporation called 'The Star me! Do you understand? of Orion,' a dummy front for Hezbollah. This morning Majid -- alright, this is insane, I Al-Khoei says the agents.of want a lawyer-- destruction are already inside our borders-- -- we find hardware in your -- I told you, it all just apartment, latest military showed up there'. You're not spec, airplane manuals, plus listening to me! twelve hundred pounds. of-- sit (tries to stand up) your ass down now -- ammonium (abruptly sits) nitrate fertilizer. Just curious if you knew any of Paul's friends in Beirut, or if he knew any of your friends -- what do you mean in Singapore, oh but that's "friends"?! right, we haven't really established whether or not you two were close-- (losing it) -- I guess we were rett close when I looked into his open casket this morning and saw the bad make-up job covering the gash in his skull! Or how about when I watched him being lowered into the ground -- that establish anything for you?! Somebody set me up! Morgan stares at him, unmoved. 
CONTINUED: (3) 
MORGAN "Somebody." Who? 
JERRY A woman, I don't know! She called me and told me I was gonna be arrested. GET 
REAL, MAN! DO I LOOK LIKE A TERRORIST TO 
YOU?!?! 
MORGAN No more than Abdul Hamid, Taliban POW we caught in Afghanistan. Except his real name was Johnny Walker Lindh. Grew up in Marin County with a basketball hoop in his driveway and a carton of Tropicana in his fridge. He was blonder than you.. though. 
(RISES) When I come back, you'd better tell me who you work for-- And heads out the door, SLAM! Jerry yells; 
JERRY 
I WORK FOR KINKO'S!!. 
INT. DHS OBSERVATION ROOM - HALLWAY CONTINUOUS 
Morgan meets supervisor MARTIN KREBS, a senior D.H.S. big wig. Standing with LATESHA.SIMMS, 32 but looks 16, African-American, computer wonk with no room fora personal life; and TOBY GRANT, 20's, straight part in his hair, wet behind the ears. They've all been observing through a two-way mirror. Latesha refers to a laptop, one she clutches like a safety blanket: 
LATESHA He fits the profile: disaffected, 'susceptible to radical indoctrination, problem with authority. Doesn't vote or pay taxes, but witness statements all say he's not a player. He does sketches of his landlady's dog. Oh, and he's lying about the woman who called him -- we checked the records, no calls came in before we picked him up -- 
KREBS What about the brother? 
LATESHA Mid-level FSO. Been stateside the past three years. No red flags. He was killed when a truck ran a light in Crystal City. 
CONTINUED: 
MORGAN That kind of equipment and a major cash infusion five hours after a terrorist threat and were smiling and saying "coincidence?" 
KREBS So either he's a rank-and-file sleeper or a dumbshit mule. 
GRANT (eager to contribute) Or a misdirect. There's nothing subtle about him or the gear. He's not exactly a pro-- Morgan levels a look at Grant as Krebs takes .a BEAT. Figuring out the next move: 
KREBS Get Smith on financials; Rieger on travel; and let's dryclean family and friends. Again. (to Morgan, veiled 
THREAT) I don't want the FBI rushing in on this. Break him. Fast. And leaves Morgan to twist.. The pressure's on. To Latesha: 
MORGAN v m m putting you on the brother. 
PITCH IN A DIGITAL GLITCH -- AN ODD.CONNECTION CLICK. 
JERRY hello? Dad--? 
WOMAN'S VOICE I told you to. run. You didn't. TIGHT ON JERRY now, terrified, breathless -- 
JERRY .no wav -- who are you?! Behind Jerry; the steel door UNLOCKS -- he whirls to the OPENING DOOR -- waiting for a Guard -- someone, anyone... BUT NO ONE COMES.::: What the hell is this?! 
WOMAN'S VOICE Follow the water. Or the fire will kill you. 
JERRY What fire?! How'd you get on this phone?! Are you the one doing all this to me? Why?! 
WOMAN'S VOICE Follow the water. Leave the building -- -- and Jerry SPINS BACK. Looks up at a WALL VENT near the ceiling -- SMOKE. Ho-shit! A SMOKE ALARM BLARES -- 
CONTINUED: 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) -- take Brisbane Street to the elevated train station: you have six minutes. 
CLICK. 
JERRY Wait, what d'you mean "follow the water"? Suddenly: TSHHHHH! Jerry turns -- in the hallway, a CEILING SPRINKLER SPRAYS. The FIRE GROWS, RAGING from the VENT -- 
JERRY (CONT'D) 
SHIT!!! 
INT. DHS FIELD OFFICE - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
People scramble -- Morgan runs to the interrogation room, sees through the glass that Jerry's gone. To a passing Agent: 
MORGAN Where's Shaw? 
AGENT Parker took him to make his phone call. 
MORGAN Took him?! On whose authority?! 
INT. DHS FIELD OFFICE -.HALLWAY - NIGHT 
SMOKE AND FIRE AND A BLARING ALARM as Jerry FOLLOWS THE SPRINKLERS -- amazingly'each sprinkler ACTIVATES as he approaches, creating a safe path through the flames. Finally he gets to a dead end -- a WINDOW -- the FIRE RAGING behind him, heat increasing, as Jerry GRABS A NEARBY CHAIR AND -- 
MORGAN (V.0.) 
JERRY SHAW!! Turns through the wild FIRE, Morgan, at the other end of the corridor -- GUN DRAWN: 
MORGAN (CONT'D) 
FREEZE, RIGHT THERE! 
JERRY 
LISTEN TO ME! I'M NOT TRYING TO ESCAPE! The fire ERUPTS between them, obscuring each other's view. No choice, Jerry turns, HURLS the chair at the WINDOW, IT SHATTERS: 
EXT. DHS FIELD OFFICE - FIRE ESCAPE - NIGHT 
Jerry prepares himself, then JUMPS TO A DRAIN PIPE -- grabbing it and lowering himself from the third floor -- dropping the last ten feet, landing HARD, recovering, running off -- 
EXT. RAISED SUBWAY PLATFORM - NIGHT 
A SUBWAY TRAIN pulls into the station. WHIP PAN to find Jerry running onto the platform -- out-of-his-mind-scared -- passes a SURVEILLANCE CAMERA looking down, as if watching him -- Jerry's eyes scan the area... then he FREEZES. THE ELECTRONIC 
SCHEDULE SIGN HAS CHANGED TO READ: "JERRY, BOARD TEE TRAIN" 
THEN JUST AS FAST, ITS BACK TO THE SCHEDULE. HOW IS THIS HAPPENING?! Across the station, Jerry sees Morgan and a team of Agents pouring down the stairs =- he runs onto the train as the DOORS CLOSE -- Morgan turns, doesn't see him. 
INT. SUBWAY CAR - MOVING - NIGHT 
The train at full speed. Oblivious Commuters. Jerry tries to calm down, make some sense. Notices. the SECURITY CAMERA in the corner, turns from it. An LCD.onthe train broadcasts CNN: 
CNN NEWSCASTER has elevated our alert status to threat level "Orange." Insiders say tomorrow night's State of the Union address will focus on... 
CONDUCTOR (V.0.) Next stop, Montrose Station. A CELL RINGS from a phone peeking out of a SLEEPING PASSENGER'S BACKPACK. He looks at it, oddly suspicious. The LCD GOES BLACK -- then the words "ANSWER IT, JERRY" appear. Looks around: no one saw it. Slips the phone from the guy's backpack -- turns away, hits "answer": 
WOMAN'S VOICE Stay on the train for three more stations until you r-- But Jerry HANGS UP -- WON'T HAVE THIS. And as the train slows, he moves to the door and -- 
EXT. MONTROSE STATION - NIGHT 
JUMPS off the train, pushes through the busy platform. Spots TWO TRANSIT OFFICERS talking on radios as they scan the crowd. Jerry turns and ducks into another TRAIN just as -- 
INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 
The DOORS CLOSE. Jerry sits, exhales. Then the cell phone -- which he stole -- RINGS AGAIN. He tenses. Won't answer. It finally stops ringing. Could it all be over? NO, BECAUSE THE 
ARE PEOPLE SHOOTING AT US? 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) Stay about fifty miles an hour, you have pursuers. 
JERRY Yeah, thanks, we're on it -- 
WOMAN'S VOICE Turn left in two-hundred feet. Indeed they do: TWO POLICE CARS BLAST AROUND A STREET CORNER FOUR BLOCKS BEHIND THEM -- DOPPLER HORNS as we CUT BACK TO: 
JERRY -- my name's Jerry Shaw, I've been set up -- somehow I don't know -- by -- 
CONTINUED: (2) He dramatically GESTURES around the car, indicating The Voice. 
WOMAN'S VOICE One hundred feet. 
RACHEL JERRY -- you don't know anything Your son?! No, I know about Kyle? nothing! Just like you don't know how to drive: use the clutch before you shift, not while you shift, not while you -- I don't need driving sh-- lessons from you, asshole! -- you drive like. this and I'm the asshole? 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D).. Turn now. 
RACHEL (annoyed as hell) I know I got it! And she YANKS the steering wheel and the.car makes a FRIGHTENING SCREAMING LEFT TURN as we CUT TO: 
INT. SUV - CHICAGO CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
Morgan drives a government-issue sedan at 80 mph. over radio: 
POLICE RADIO (V.0.) All units, respond code 3 -- suspect's headed south on Stanley -- Morgan makes a hard right, .tearing around a corner -- 
INT. BMW - CHICAGO CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
Two cop cars have become THREE in the rearview mirror -- even more insane, Â°all.the TRAFFIC LIGHTS are suddenly changing to create a MIRACLE PATH for the BMW -- stopping traffic to let them pass,. starting it up again to CUT OFF the cop cars. It's as if someone.'s.playing chess with the city grid-- 
RACHEL JERRY (creeped out) --the lights are all changing to green... it's like... -- like they're changing for us... 
WOMAN'S VOICE Accelerate to sixty -- turn right in four- hundred feet... 
JERRY (looking up, scared) -- oh, no way -- 
CONTINUED: Rachel looks up too -- eyes wide: A TEN-STORY-TALL CONSTRUCTION 
CRANE TURNING FAST, THE BLOCK-LONG ARM SWINGING ABOVE THE 
STREET, HOLDING FIVE STEEL GIRDERS-- 
JERRY (CONT'D) -- sixt ! Go to sixty! And suddenly the crane DROPS THE GIRDERS -- Rachel SCREAMS -- 
JERRY (CONT'D) 
SHIT!! And the STEEL BEAMS SLAM INTO THE PAVEMENT, JUST BEHIND THE BMW,

RACHEL -- this isn't happening!!! Tries to DOWNSHIFT -- GRINNNNNNNND!! 
JERRY RACHEL 
CLUTCH! I'M CLUTCHING!! She tries to shift -- Jerry puts his hand on hers -- JAMS THE GEAR SHIFT INTO FOURTH -- the car swerves to avoid a car: 
JERRY 
GO RIGHT GO RIGHT!!! Rachel yanks the wheel, SKIDS round the corner -- more police screech in ahead -- she's forced to VEER onto a ONE-WAY STREET! 
JERRY (CONT'D) RACHEL Getoffthe street -- wait, --WILLYOU SHUT UP?!!!! no,turnup ahead, keep going --WILLYOU JUST SHUT UP AND --go...wait -- stop -- TURN LETMEDO IT!!

RACHEL

MORGAN'S CAR: 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MORGAN They're headed for the harbor! Gimme roadblocks at Granville and Sheridan! IN THE BMW: Jerry and Rachel speed through an industrial marina. Up ahead, the intersection's closed by a POLICE BARRICADE. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Turn right in two-hundred feet. MORGAN'S CAR: he SEES Rachel coming right at him. Just before they collide, she TURNS RIGHT. Morgan SLAMS his brakes -- his car FISHTAILS -- the cruisers behind him come to a.stop; but now 
BLOCK HIS WAY. 
STORE OWNER (CONT'D) Sorry, what? 
CONTINUED: 
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN (snaps out of it) No. Is not possible. it must be done this afternoon -- 
STORE OWNER Listen, Mister -- The Middle Eastern Man suddenly touches his ear, BARKS out something in Tajiki. Like he's arguing with someone. 
STORE OWNER (CONT'D) -- are you okay? 
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN (looks at his watch) I will pay you triple. Please. A courier will be by to pick it:'up at three. Do it, please... please. And stepping back, he exits quickly. The Store Owner watches him leave, then looks back down at the BOX. 
INT. RIVER SIDE - DAY 
A Coast Guard cutter floats beside the now-abandoned garbage barge. The BMW's been lifted ashore by a crane -- FORENSIC TECHS comb every inch. MORGAN circles the car. Grant follows, a WAITING CHOPPER in the background. 
AGENT GRANT All the surveillance cameras in the area have turned up nothing -- no ID on the girl, nothing on the VIN -- 
MORGAN All I want is a goddamn picture of her -- what about traffic cams? There are more cameras on that route than the Super 
BOWL-- 
AGENT GRANT Department of Transpo says there was a seven minute equipment failure -- 
MORGAN AGENT GRANT Do NOT tell me their equipment was down! Do NOT! Sir, that's what they're telling me... From Northbrook to the 290?! What about the bogus fax from Justice, was that equipment failure too? -- No sir, there's gotta be someone on the inside. -- ya think?! 
CONTINUED: Pissed, Morgan starts -- fast -- for the chopper -- we move with him and Grant, who keeps up: 
MORGAN The getaway car was waiting there -- get me a witness description on the woman driving -- remember witnesses? People who see things?! Jesus, is this a lost art? 
AGENT GRANT I have Markey on that right now Morgan's PHONE IS RINGING -- he answers: 
MORGAN Morgan. When? NO. You tell them hold that 'til I talk to Sanford - (hangs up, to Grant) WTMZ has a report that there's a terrorist at large in the.city,-- I'm going back to forensics. Find out where the hell that fax originated.-- if you don't have good news for me before I touch down you will be demoted to a job that will require you. to touch shit with your hands --do you understand me? 
AGENT GRANT Yes sir! As Morgan hops up onto the moving chopper -- 
MORGAN Nobody who works for me calls me sir. understand?! It's disingenuous -- might as well be calling me 'asshole.' As Grant watches the chopper take off, perplexed. 
EXT. MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - DAY 
An endless stretch of road lined with electrical line towers... Two FIGURES, like specks against the landscape -- Jerry and Rachel, walking, wet, cold. And then: 
RACHEL So you're a twin. 
(BEAT) Who works at a copy place. And she manages a clipped, judgemental (frankly rude) laugh. 
JERRY Yeah, I know... that's occurred to me. 
CONTINUED: 
RACHEL So this whole situation is obviously about him. 
JERRY Excuse me? I would offer this whole situation isn't "obviously" about anything. 
RACHEL Just think about it: you said your brother worked at the State Department -- 
JERRY -- so what? 
RACHEL -- so that means he could've: been into anythinc -- he was a twin -:- you..received a shipment of weapons and cash and airplane manuals -- it seems to me that they sent the stuff to.the wrong brother-- 
JERRY Wait a minute -- you're suggesting all that stuff was for Paul? As they approach TOWER 108: 
RAC HE L Hey, I'm sorry that he died, I'm not trying to insult his memory -- 
JERRY he hasn't been dead long enough to become a memory! And if you knew Paul, which you did not, you'd laugh all day at the idea that he was a spy or terrorist or whatever you're implying -- 
RACHEL I'm implying if not him... then why you? 
JERRY Well hasn't that been the question my whole life. You know how I know Paul wasn't a terrorist? Because if he had been, he would've been the best fucking terrorist in history: he wouldn't have gotten caught, the United States would be a crater -- he would've won awards for being a great terrorist. 
(THEN) What about you? Why'd she choose you -- what's your day job? I know it isn't "manual-shift driver." 
CONTINUED: (2) 
RACHEL I did just fine driving, thanks. I'm a paralegal -- I have no connection to anything. 
JERRY Really? Suddenly they're interrupted by the ROOSTERTAIL OF DUST approaching in the distance. Rachel stops dead and on INSTINCT, grabs Jerry's hand, all their mutual hostility vanished: 
RACHEL Someone's coming. And what's approaching is the "Hassad DryCleaners." van. It comes to a stop and out steps the Middle Eastern Man. Stands some twenty-five feet from them. 
MIDDLE EASTERN MAN Are you Jerry Shaw? 
CONTINUED: 
COLONEL THOMPSON Fine job. 
WEAPONS DEVELOPER Thank you, sir. We're proud of this ordnance -- all of us at Halloway-Smith. And while we still HEAR HIM SPEAKING, we CUT TO: 
INT. CLEAN PREP-ROOM - HALLOWAY-SMITH LABS- CONTINUOUS 
A TECHNICIAN at an assembly line where ROBOT ARMS_ work on a stream of components: the careful manufacturing of HEX. The acoustic trigger and its crystal counterpart. 
WEAPONS DEVELOPER.(V.0.) If you're satisfied with today's final test, the Hex Project has met every... contractual objective. The arms package each into separate . containers, fit them with shipping labels marked: "PENTAGON DIRECT." 
WEAPONS DEVELOPER (V.0.) (CONT'D) And we're hoping this moves us into the next scheduled phase... shipping the product into the field. Drift toward an unmanned computer. The screen FLICKERS: "OVERRIDE IN PROGRESS,. CHANGE SHIPPING DESTINATION." Robot arms grab a wrapped package off the line. A new label's printed: 
"ASHLAND & SONS CIO JERRY SHAW." 
INT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - DAY 
Latesha walking down a hallway. Endless miles of shiny marble and military paintings. Her CELL RINGS. It's Morgan: 
MORGAN (V.O.) Whaddya got? 
LATESHA 
(SOTTO) Those funny things underneath my not-so- stylish pantsuit? They brought me all the way to the Pentagon. Paul Shaw wasn't State -- 
EXT. SKIES ABOVE CHICAGO - DAY 
A chopper ROARS over skyscrapers. Morgan beside the PILOT in front, listening to Latesha over his helmet headset. 
LATESHA (V.0.) -- he was Defense. 
CONTINUED: 
MORGAN You're kidding me. What capacity? 
LATESHA (V.0.) Black-file: classified B-36. 
MORGAN B what? 
INT. HALLWAY - PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS 
She turns a corner. DOWN THE HALLWAY a PHALANX of GENERALS, MILITARY PERSONNEL and SCURRYING ASSISTANTS heading towards a set of DOUBLE-DOORS. Some very big meeting about to happen - 
LATESHA That's the point. No one'll tell me. I cross-reffed the SCI database, talked to the Intel committee, NSA gave me..nothing. Krebs doesn't want me to ruffle any feathers. I've been up and down all the ladders and everyone just thinks I'm a -- WHEN an MP suddenly appears and grabs her by the arm. Stopping her. He towers over her -- 
MP Interns aren't allowed on this floor, miss. You'll have to -- When Latesha wearily flashes him her I.D. I've got clearance, pal. He looks at it. Lets her arm go. 
M.P. -- sorry. 
LATESHA (to M.P.) Everybody in this place have a six-foot height requirement? (continues walking; back to Morgan) Anyway. I'm going back to the office to-- 
MORGAN (V.0.) No, no, no -- 
INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS 
The PILOT signaling to Morgan-- 
PILOT -- I got the Williamson County Sheriff on the line -- Morgan holds up a hand, one second. To Latesha: 
CONTINUED: 
MORGAN Look, I don't have time for this -- stay there til you get some answers -- 
LATESHA (V.O.) -- but its a total shut out -- 
MORGAN Simms: step up -- 
INT. PENTAGON - CONTINUOUS 
MORGAN (V.O.) -- I don't care if you have to go to the. top to do it. Whatever means necessary, got it? Whatever means. CLICK. Latesha lowers the phone. A HUGE:PAINTING of the battle of EL-ALAMEIN looming behind her. Shelooks..back down the hallway as all the BRASS heading into the MEETING ROOM and catches sight of -- CALLISTER amongst them. Latesha hesitates. For just a second. Shit. Shit. This is it. Before suddenly rushing forward and calling out -- 
LATESHA Secretary Callister!.: He looks behind him briefly before being shuffled into the meeting room. And SLAM.. The doors close in Latesha's face. 
LATESHA (CONT'D) Well, shit. 
INT. DRY CLEANING VAN - CITY STREETS - INDIANAPOLIS - DAY 
The van speeds down a highway, passing a sign: "WELCOME TO INDIANAPOLIS: YOUR HOME TOWN!" Jerry drives, pensive. Rachel stares out the-window, the shock of what she's seen only fueling her rage at the whole situation. 
JERRY how old is he? Your son. 
RACHEL Yes. And so. They turn around. And get back in the van. 
EXT. TOWER 108 - DAY 
THE CHARRED FACE OF THE MIDDLE EASTERN MAN, FROZEN IN A SCREAM. Morgan runs towards it, the SHERIFF and a POWER WORKER trying to keep up. Chopper in B.G. Police officers work the scene. 
POWER WORKER Never seen anything like it. Power blew out from Franklin High School down to the river club. I can't explain it - They arrive at the body. Contorted, blackened, teeth bared. 
SHERIFF No I.D. We know he's male, though. Probably in his 20's. (points off) Tire treads entering and leaving the scene over three. Three sets of shoe prints. 
MORGAN And we're about 4 miles from the river -- Just then we see Agent Grant running towards them, stumbling on some rocks. Just finishing-.up a cell call: 
AGENT GRANT Agent Morgan!" (out of breath, sotto) Just got off with HQ. The fake fax from Justice that got Shaw his phone call? Came from inside Justice. 
MORGAN Inside?! You absolutely sure on that? 
AGENT GRANT Yes, s-- (catches himself) Yes I am. 
MEDICAL EXAMINER Got something -- As the M.E. pulls something out of Middle Eastern Man's ear: a small, charred GIZMO. Small WIRE sticking out. Lifts it up for them to see. Morgan takes the TWEEZERS -- 
GRANT Looks like a bone mic, military grade. 
CONTINUED: 
MORGAN Can't even get these things on the black market. (looks around landscape) Someone was talking to him. Something's rotten in Denmark. No, something's rotten everywhere. Morgan turns abruptly and starts back for the chopper. The Sheriff helplessly calls after him: 
SHERIFF We'll be needing that for evidence! 
EXT. 56TH STREET - DAY 
Jerry and Rachel's van pulls up to THE FEDERAL BANK OF INDIANAPOLIS. Across the way is a STADIUM for the COLTS. The parking lot's full, mid-game. They stare;.steeling themselves for the inevitable... 
RACHEL a Federal bank? 
JERRY Could be worse. Could.be.a Federal Prison. 
INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE -;LOBBY - DAY 
A wall-mounted clock ticks to "11:00"--WHIP TO Jerry and Rachel entering. Security cams everywhere. As they nervously cross the floor, they pass TWO ARMED BRINKS COURIERS entering an elevator. A BANK MANAGER APPROACHES: 
MANAGER Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? I'm Mr. Bids. I understand you're in a hurry, why don't I show you to your box. 
JERRY (WHAT THE FUCK?! then:) yes, thank you, we'd... like that. The manager walks them across to a secure elevator with a THERMOGRAPHIC SCANNER. The manager looks at Jerry expectantly, waiting for him to place his hand on it. He does: a flash of light, identifying him as: "SAXON, CARL." Jerry's eyes: this is madness. The elevator doors OPEN. 
INT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - VAULT - DAY 
They exit the elevator, the manager leads them to a DEPOSIT BOX. He pulls out a metal key, identical to the one the Middle Eastern Man gave Jerry: 
CONTINUED: 
MANAGER Your key? Jerry takes out his key, it fits perfectly. They turn; the box slides out, the manager lays it on a steel table. LEAVES to give them privacy. Jerry and Rachel stare at the box. 
RACHEL You gonna open it? 
JERRY Maybe it's not gonna be so bad. 
RACHEL Yeah... maybe it's something good.. They meet eyes. Tentatively, he raises the lid to find TWO GLOCK PISTOLS and the same BONE MIC we saw.the.M.E. pull out of the Middle Eastern Man's ear. A note.: "EAR:MIC. NOW." 
JERRY RACHEL Oh, shit -- it's bad -- They look at each other. Jerry puts the..mic in his ear: 
WOMAN'S VOICE OVER MIC Both guns are loaded, safety's off. In sixty seconds,':two,men Will exit the adjacent vault carrying a briefcase. Take it -- by force if necessary -- then exit the building.. Jerry can't fucking believe this. Rachel dying to know: 
RACHEL -- what?! 
JERRY -- I don't suppose -- there's any easier way to`get whatever the hell it is you want -- is there? Miss? But she's not answering. 
JERRY (CONT'D) Excellent. 
RACHEL What now -- what are we? 
BUT THE VAULT NEXT DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS-- 
CONTINUED: (2) 
JERRY RACHEL -- they're coming--we're supposed to rob them -- -- are you kidding me?!?! (hands her a GUN) -- just take i t-- -- no! Jesus! I don't even let Kyle play with water guns! -- hey, I applaud your parenting skills -- take it! The footsteps come CLOSER as two MEN appear... the.-BRINKS COURIERS from the lobby; one of them's carrying a METALLIC BRIEFCASE cuffed to his wrist -- the other spots Jerry's gun and REACTS, going for his gun: 
JERRY Don't! The men freeze -- Jerry holds his gun awkwardly -- 
JERRY (CONT'D) Uh... hi. How's it going. Put. it on the floor. The briefcase. We don't wanna hurt you guys, we like you guys -- just -- we need the case. 
COURIER #1 You're bringing a shitstorm on your heads, you know that. 
LATESHA It'll only take a minute, sir, thirty seconds -- B-36? Can you tell me what it is? 'Cause its not -- 
CALLISTER -- you don't have clearance, Agent Simms, and I don't have thirty seconds. 
LATESHA So should I assume it has something to. do with the four CVN class 21 aircraft carriers you and the president just ordered to the Strait of Hormuz -? He looks at her, stunned. How the hell--? 
LATESHA (CONT'D) I just checked the intel, sir, we have some of the same indexes -- 
CALLISTER You need to stop assuming. And he moves on. Latesha gets jostled by all the brass, feeling like a mouse in cage filled with lions. Until she ROARS: 
LATESHA Secretary Callister. Voice echoing down the hail. Callister stops short, stunned by the gall and volume of this woman. She weaves through the GENERALS, planting herself in front of him: 
LATESHA (CONT'D) My Department's tracking a home-grown terrorist on the loose as we speak who may be connected to a cell with ties inside this building. Now seeing as you just had a meeting back there with more brass than the Navy Marching Band and with the terror threat rising every three hours, I'm going to just have to assume you're in the middle of a very delicate dance to stave off World War Three... so with all due respect, you either give me my thirty seconds and tell me what the hell B-36 is, or this world just fell into an even bigger heap of trouble. Sir. Callister looks down at her, completely struck dumb. She's hit a chord deep inside him. It's called balls. SLAM TO: 
INT. LOBBY - FOUR SEASONS HOTEL - DAY 
As Jerry and Rachel enter the POSH LOBBY of the FOUR SEASONS, an obsequious BELLHOP approaches -- he's been waiting for them: 
BELLHOP Mr. and Mrs. Saxon? This way, please -- Tries to take the BRIEFCASE from Jerry, who yanks it back: 
JERRY No! 2 trot it. (forces a smile) Thanks, though. 
INT. PENTAGON - ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY 
Latesha dumps her things on a tray, moves through a scanner -- among her items is a set of KEYS with aMINI.SWISS ARMY KNIFE. She's handed a NEW BADGE that reads: "TEMPORARY ACCESS." Ahead, an elevator door OPENS and we start CROSS CUTTING: 
INT. ELEVATOR - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS 
Jerry, Rachel, and the bellhop step in. The Hop hits "Penthouse." MUZAK. They travel up: 
BELLHOP So, where'd you two get hitched? 
JERRY RACHEL Reno. Niagara Falls. Shit. 
JERRY RACHEL Niagara Falls. Reno. Shit. The "DING" of an arriving elevator MATCHES US BACK TO: 
INT. PENTAGON ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
THE LEVEL INDICATOR, having just arrived at floor "B-35." Latesha, wedged between two PENTAGON GUARDS, watches nervously as one of them uses a KEY to open a PANEL revealing: A BIOMETRIC SENSOR. The other guard holds his thumb to the scanner -- yet another PANEL OPENS, with a RED BUTTON marked "B- 36." It hits Latesha: B-36 is a secret level in the Pentagon. The elevator DESCENDS to the final level and OPENS, revealing: 
INT. HALLWAY - LEVEL B-36 - CONTINUOUS 
12-foot concrete walls. High-tech ventilation and surveillance system. Standing there waiting is SCOTT BOWMAN, early thirties, hasn't seen daylight in a while: 
SCOTT Agent Simms? Scott Bowman: Welcome to B- 36. If you'll follow me? 
INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - FOUR SEASONS - CONTINUOUS 
The Bellhop dramatically opens the door -- 
BELLHOP Welcome to paradise. Palatial HONEYMOON SUITE. Picture windows, rose petals on the bed... 
BELLHOP (CONT'D) Minibar, high-speed internet, thousand- count sheets. And if you're looking for the TV He clicks a remote and a 72" PLASMA TV rises up from a cabinet. On screen, a narrated "virtual tour".of the hotel: 
TV VOICE dedicated to the highest standards of luxury and comfort... 
BELLHOP Robes behind the door, jacuzzi with eighteen nozzles that hit in all the right places, if you'll pardon my French. .Need anything, just dial zero, I'm here t2. serve, I'm here to please... And he stands by the door, waiting for a tip. Jerry's still looking aroundwhen Rachel catches his eye. Well? Oh. Jerry digs into his pocket and pulls out TWO NICKELS. 
JERRY Knock yourself out. The Bellhop is still looking down at his palm when Jerry SHUTS THE DOOR on him. 
RACHEL This is nice and everything, but what the hell are we doing here? 
CONTINUED: 
JERRY Nice? One night in this place is more than one of my paychecks; and that's before taxes -- He heads over to the minibar. Starts rooting through it, pulling out those tiny bottles of alcohol... 
RACHEL What're you doing? 
JERRY If we're going down, I'm gonna go down singing. Hey! Chocolate covered almonds, I love these! 
RACHEL Can you stop eating for a second? A KNOCK at the door and they stop arguing immediately. 
WOMAN'S VOICE Answer it. They TURN hearing the voice: it's.coming from the T.V. The FOUR SEASONS GRAPHIC still dancing on screen. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) There are items you will need for the next step. KNOCK! KNOCK! A small nod from Rachel and Jerry opens the door. A DELIVERY BOY stands there with a BAG: 
DELIVERY BOY There y'go, Mr. Saxon. Have a nice day? Jerry takes the bag -- the kid puts out his hand for a tip just as Jerry closes the door on him, dazed. Starts pulling things from the bag: hair. dye, clothes... 
WOMAN'S VOICE The limousine is waiting for you `downstairs. You have 30 minutes to change your appearance. 
RACHEL Where are we going now? 
ARIA We were colleagues. Rachel staring at the picture on the screen, then back at Jerry. Can see the blood draining from his face. 
JERRY (trying to process) No, he worked for the State Department..: 
ARIA Everyone in deep operations has a cover. Your brother was a Horseman. 
JERRY What's the hell is a 'Horseman'? 
INT. MAINFRAME TANK - CONTINUOUS 
SCOTT You know, clever allegory -- of the apocalypse'--`except we're here to prevent it. Scott taps the console, ID PHOTOS APPEAR of our four "Horsemen": PAUL SHAW, SCOTT, and two men we'll call LOWELL and JIMMY. 
SCOTT (CONT'D) Officially, we don't exist, but we monitor Aria's network 24/7. There were :four of us... til Paul died. (beat, it's still raw) He was smarter than all of us put together. 
LATESHA Working here must be pretty tough -- all the security, the pressure, long hours... As in: "Did you notice him acting strangely?" 
SCOTT Yeah, but you could set your watch by Paul. Except... 
LATESHA Except what? 
CONTINUED: 
SCOTT The night he died? He left his shift three minutes early. Which you don't do. Which he wouldn't do. Latesha's suddenly locked in on a clue -- PRELAP: 
ARIA (V.0.) Paul and I had a disagreement before he expired... 
INT. HONEYMOON SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Jerry sinks to the edge of the bed, runs hands: through his hair: 
ARIA To amend it, I need Jerry to perform a task. Simple. 
JERRY (V.0.) Expired?! You mean died.. That's what we call it, we humans, we call it dying-- 
RACHEL What's the task? 
ARIA (V.0.) To insure the national security of the United States. 
RACHEL What d'you need me for then? 
ARIA (V.0.) That is not your concern right now. 
RACHEL Are you kidding me? 
JERRY Alright, this is bullshit. I'm not doing this --- and you're a computer, you don't know a goddamn thing about my brother. 
ARIA (V.0.) I know all about him, Jerry. And you. The screen snaps to a SLIDE SHOW of PAUL SHAW'S accomplishments: childhood birthday parties, sports teams, surrounded by friends, beautiful girlfriends, high school graduation, Yale graduation, standing with their dad, William's arm over his shoulder. Jerry almost GASPS at Aria's reaching into his subconscious: 
ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) Your brother succeeded in everything he did. 
(MNRF) 
CONTINUED: 
ARIA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Before he was a year old, he walked. Something that took you eighteen months to accomplish. He was highly gifted, intelligent and principled -- in fact, the only Horseman ever to challenge me. But you, Jerry -- The slide show CHANGES to SECURITY FOOTAGE of Jerry at KINKO'S, slaving away. Playing cards with Kwame, slacking off. His stomach drops. Seeing himself like this. Looking so pathetic. The heart has just been cut out of him. Rachel sees it -- 
ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) You are similar to Paul in DNA only. Historically you have succeeded in nothing. Initiated nothing. Excelled in nothing. You will perform the task because it is your nature to follow. 
(BEAT) And because you've seen what happens to deserters. 
RACHEL -- Jesus, ENOUGH! The screen goes BLACK. 
ARIA (V.0.:) You have 23 minutes to prepare. There's an adjoining suite with a second bathroom. The DOOR to the adjoining SUITE clicks open. 
ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) Use it. And she's gone, replaced by the hotel's promotional prattle -- 
TV VOICE The Four Seasons prides itself on excellent service Jerry stares, overcome. Rachel watches him an emotional beat... 
RACHEL 
(SOFTLY) Jerry? Without answering, he grabs the bag. Walks into the other room without a word. Closes the door. She stares, feeling his shame... then her eyes go to the BRIEFCASE TIMER counting down: 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MAN'S VOICE Halloway-Smith contracted us to transport the briefcase to their corporate office... 
EXT. INDIANAPOLIS FEDERAL RESERVE - DAY 
The bank's roped off and labelled "CRIME AREA." Morgan questions the Couriers, studies their transport manifest: 
MORGAN Biotech? The chemical company? 
ARIA CAM -- WATCHING LATESHA.FROM ABOVE: "TRACE IN PROGRESS... 
INTERCEPTING CALL." INTERCUTTING WITH MORGAN IN THE 7-11 -- he hears: 
LATESHA'S VOICE Four years ago, DARPA commissioned... (garbled)... .computer... (garbled)... 
MORGAN Simms? You're breaking up -- WITH LATESHA -- her cell LCD says: "Call lost." No bars. Muttering "dainnit," she tries to call Morgan back. No dice. ARIA PQV CAM: Latesha snaps her phone shut, notices the camera watching her. Unsettling. We read: "VOICE MIMEO ACTIVATED" 
INT. 7-11 - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
And though Latesha isn't speaking, WE START TO HEAR HER VOICE: 
LATESHA/ARIA (V.0.) Sorry about that -- As we realize Aria's taken over the call by mimicking Latesha: 
LATESHA/ARIA (V.0.) (CONT'D) I'm getting a bad signal down here. 
CONTINUED: 
MORGAN I heard 'DARPA' and 'computer' --? 
LATESHA/ARIA Yes, B-36 was part of a super-computer project, but it was decommissioned. A dead end. The archives are at Fort Meade. Do you want me to head over there? -- but Morgan's only half-listening now as he sees. something on the CCTV feeds: 
MORGAN Wait -- go back, freeze that - WHAT HE SEES: A STILL of Jerry and Rachel getting in the limo, faces obscured. 
MORGAN (CONT.':D) Punch up the plate The image enhances, revealing a PLATE NUMBER, its frame bearing the company name: "ICON LIMOUSINE SERVICES." 
MORGAN (CONT'D) (to Grant) Find that car! (back to Latesha) Simms, gotta jump, sit tight 'til I call. 
LATESHA Yes, sir. Morgan, preoccupied, is about to hang up. But stops: did she just call me sir? 
INT. MAINFRAME TANK - B-36 - DAY 
Latesha returns to the NETWORK MONITORING HUB to find Scott typing at.the console. A MACHINE ARM drops down from above, spider-like.: The device animates as a CRANIAL SCANNER opens: 
SCOTT Aria's system uses biometric security to identify us, so only Horsemen can access her core programming. Suddenly his head's ensconced in a LASER GRID that scans every inch of his features: "PROCESSING FOR MATCH... HORSEMAN IDENT CONFIRMED: BOWMAN, SCOTT." Latesha watches somewhat dumbstruck as the machine arm retreats upward. 
SCOTT (CONT'D) (clicks on mic) Aria, go voice active, please. 
CONTINUED: 
ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) Hello, Scott. How may I assist you? 
LATESHA It talks? 
ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) I'm fluent in 6,800 languages, 41,000 dialects, and 750 extinct tongues. 
SCOTT Aria, this is Latesha Simms, she's here as part of a counter-terrorism task force. 
ARIA OVER SPEAKER.(V.0. A pleasure to serve you, Ms. Simms. 
LATESHA (thrown, to Scott). Am I supposed to -- (he gestures, "answer Um... what's up. 
SCOTT. Aria, I'd like to:bring,up all the log feeds the night Paul died -- when he left the building. 
ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) Of course. Scott types on the console and after a BEAT grainy black-and- white SURVEILLANCE FEED springs up onto the big MONITOR. Several different angles Of PAUL SHAW exiting the mainframe tank, moving down corridors, getting in the elevator. Weird to see this TINTYPE of Jerry. Same eyes, same hair, same walk. Flicks a quick look up at the camera -- 
LATESHA There's no feed from inside here? 
SCOTT No need for cameras in here, we've got Aria. Latesha looks through a glass divider at Aria floating in the tank. Creeped out. The FOOTAGE JUMPING as Paul rounds the corner for the elevator. Presses his THUMB to the panel. 
SCOTT (V.0.) (CONT'D) So weird... no overt body language, he's even casual. Leaving like it's any other day. 
CONTINUED: (2) 
LATESHA Except three minutes early... ON THE MONITOR: the elevator doors open and Paul steps inside. Latesha studies the feed. Something's not right. Then... her eyes NARROW: the way Paul's facing the button panel. Like he's deliberately pivoting away from the camera. 
LATESHA (CONT'D) Wait, in the reflection, did you see that? Scott rewinds the FOOTAGE, ZOOMS IN. Paul stepping into the elevator and facing the button panel. CLOSE ON HIS FACE in the panel's REFLECTIVE SURFACE -- 
SCOTT Is he... blinking? Yes. Erratically, deliberately. Fucking weird. Scott and Latesha share a look. Suddenly, the image on the monitor starts to FLICKER and JUMP -- 
ARIA. OVER SPEAKER (V.O.) I'm experiencing interference in network 7752B, please allow me to shut down and analyze. 
SCOTT Negative, I'm prioritizing this. 
ARIA OVER SPEAKER (V.0.) I'll note my protest in the data log. This is getting weirder by the second -- PAUL'S DISTORTED REFLECTION in the panel, his eyes definitely blinking weirdly: 
LATESHA It's like he's trying to say something... 
SCOTT A code. He's blinking code 
LATESHA It's not Morse, but there's a sequence to it -- 
RACHEL -- Paris? 
ARIA (V.0.) Once you have the tickets, walk to gate 17-C. Move quickly. 
EXT. DAYTON INTERNATIONALAIRPORT - TARMAC - CONTINUOUS 
A chopper TOUCHES DOWN near a waiting contingent of AGENTS and AIRPORT PD -- Morgan and Grant hop out on the MOVE, handing out BLURRY VIDEO STILLS from the 7-11: 
MORGAN He's with a brunette female, approximately five-seven -- I want airport PD at all exits -- have the tower shift commander ground every flight outta here under Federal jurisdiction but don't change the departure boards, I don't want 'em to know we're coming-- The agents enter the airport through a door on the tarmac --

Jerry and Rachel show their tickets and ID's to a TSA SCREENER, watching all the people on the X-ray line... families... kids... Jerry looks down at the case that could kill them all... 
CONTINUED: 
SECURITY ATTENDANT Sir, you'll have to put that through. Jerry nervously sets it on the conveyor belt, they pull off their shoes... watch the case move toward the mouth of the machine, then pass through the metal detector, catching a GLIMPSE of the X-RAY SCREEN... the briefcase glides into view... A STRANGE GLITCH as the screen fritzes, then normalizes revealing the contents: A HAIR DRYER AND DIRTY CLOTHES?! They notice the surveillance cam watching: 
RACHEL (a murmur) she changed the screen... The case comes off the conveyor, the TSA agent hands it back: 
TSA AGENT Can't be too careful. 
JERRY (forces a smile) You're doing a great job. As they walk on, he checks the timer, 00:03:22... 00:03:21.. 11 They pass a KIDS' BAND and their teacher, gathered around an airline CUSTOMER SERVICE DESK. 
BAND LEADER

JERRY (to Rachel, urgent) -- we aottago As Morgan races forward, ARIA ACTS: the X-ray screen FRITZES again as another carry-on goes through, revealing its "contents" as a HAND GUN AND KNIVES! The TSA agent hits a RED BUTTON -- 
TSA AGENT

CONTINUED: (2) And in a nanosecond, all TSA AGENTS draw guns and throw a KOREAN MAN against the wall -- he SHOUTS in confusion as they tear open his bag to reveal... it's filled with BIBLES! 
MORGAN 
MOVE! EVERYBODY MOVE! FEDERAL OFFICER! MOVING WITH JERRY AND RACHEL -- past a wall made of THIRTY FLAT SCREEN MONITORS that form one massive NIKE ad of Lebron slam dunking -- at once, the screens CHANGE to spell out the words: 
GATE 17-C. THEY'RE THIRTEEN SECONDS BEHIND YOU. Jerry and Rachel streak towards 17-C as the screens RETURN TO NORMAL when Morgan and agents follow with pistols swinging -- INTERCUT SURVEILLANCE CAM POV: as Jerry and Rachel hurtle past an ATM MACHINE, IT SPITS OUT A CASH CLOUD..THAT"INCITES A FEEDING FRENZY -- agents SLAM into commuters and topple -- 
MORGAN REACTS TO WHAT HE SEES -- HOW'D THAT JUST HAPPEN? Agent Grant and airport cops round the corner ahead -- our heroes veer past a FLASHING MESSAGE BOARD that changes: 
GET ON THE SLIDEWALK. They leap onto the SLIDEWALK which starts ACCELERATING as they run -- travellers gawk as Jerry and Rachel race by -- they reach the end but are going so fast.that they're JETTISONED off the conveyor, TUMBLING into passengers. Agents run onto the slidewalk but it SUDDENLY BRAKES, JERKING them off their feet -- they're LAUNCHED into the air, a domino- effect of crashing people.` Jerry and Rachel pull themselves up and run toward gate 17-C, another screen CHANGES: 
TAKE THE EMERGENCY EXIT. Above a door, the "EXIT" sign FLASHES UNNATURALLY -- the door automatically UNLOCKS -- they push through -- Morgan runs up, too late; the door's shut again. Sees an AIRPORT JANITOR -- 
MORGAN (CONT'D) Open this NOW! The janitor quickly swipes his ID through the keycard scanner, but it BUZZES RED. Aria's locking them out. Morgan FIRES his gun at the lock -- people SCREAM as he slams through --

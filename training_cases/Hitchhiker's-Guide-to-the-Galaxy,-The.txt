OVER DARKNESS...                                                  1 
...we hear what we will come to know as the VOICE OF THE GUIDE. GUIDE VOICE It is an important and popular fact that things are not always what they seem. 
A small square image appears on screen.    Home video.      The dolphin stadium at Sea World. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) For instance, on the planet Earth, man had always assumed that he was the most intelligent species occupying the planet, instead of the third most intelligent which was, in fact, entirely accurate. 
The dolphins perform; leaping through hoops, etc. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) The second most intelligent creatures were, of course, dolphins who curiously enough had long known of the impending destruction of the planet Earth. They had made many attempts to alert mankind to the danger, but most of their communications were misinterpreted as amusing attempts to punch footballs or whistle for tidbits, so they eventually decided they would leave Earth by their own means. 
They leap madly, desperately. Higher and higher... 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) The last ever dolphin message was misinterpreted as a surprisingly sophisticated attempt to do a double- backward somersault through a hoop while whistling the "Star-Spangled Banner" but in fact the message was this... "So long and thanks for all the fish." 
TITLES ROLL - (FULL SCREEN 35mm IMAGES) 
Dolphins leap over and interact with the opening titles. Breathtaking somersaults, back flips, choreographed to a Buzby Berkley-style song called, "SO LONG AND THANKS FOR ALL THE FISH." We end with a wide shot of all the dolphins jumping out of the top of frame, but they never come back down. TILT UP to a starry night sky - the dolphins have vanished. 
END TITLES 
As night turns to morning, we hear CLICK, then... 
VOICE ON RADIO ...as well as Sea World Orlando and San Diego reporting their dolphins have mysteriously disappeared overnight.

INT. ARTHUR DENT'S BEDROOM - MORNING                        2 
CLOSE ON the clock radio from which the voice emanates. A hand shuts it off. ARTHUR DENT is awake. 30's. Kind faced. His feet land perfectly in slippers as he stands and shuffles out of his very neat but very boring room. 
3   IN THE BATHROOM - Arthur gargles in front of the mirror.    3 He bends over to spit revealing a YELLOW BULLDOZER through the window, crawling toward his house. A TEA KETTLE WHISTLES O.S. 
4   INT. ARTHUR DENT'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                     4 
Arthur sets the newspaper (with the headline "DOLPHINS VANISH") on the table, removes the kettle. Doesn't notice through the window 3 MORE LARGE YELLOW BULLDOZERS. 
He pours a cup of tea, sets the pot down next o his mobile phone. He picks it up, stares at a DIGITAL PHOTO ON THE SCREEN of himself and a very pretty woman (Tricia) at a costume party. 
He presses the phone to his head as if it were a cold compress. Suddenly, there's a LOUD RUMBLING o.s. The tea cup RATTLES. Arthur looks out the window. Now he sees the bulldozers. 
The tea cup shatters on the floor. CUT TO: 5   EXT. ARTHUR DENT'S HOUSE - MORNING                          5 
Arthur, dressed in pajamas and robe, lies in the dirt in front of a bulldozer, blocking it from destroying his house. He yells into his mobile phone. 
ARTHUR (into phone) What do you mean he's gone out to lunch? You just said he was still at breakfast! 
MR. PROSSER, a bureaucrat, leans over him. 
PROSSER Come off it, Mr. Dent. You can't lie in front of the bulldozers forever. 
ARTHUR I'm game. We'll see who rusts first. 
PROSSER This bypass has got to be built and it's going to be built. You should have made your protest months ago. 
ARTHUR The first I heard of it was when a workman came yesterday. I asked if he'd come to clean the windows, and he said he'd come to demolish the house. He didn't tell me right away of course. First he wiped a couple of windows and charged me twenty quid. Then he told me. (CONTINUED)

The bulldozer driver, looking guilty, ducks behind the steering wheel. Prosser removes plans from his briefcase. 
PROSSER Look. These plans have been on display at the planning office now for a year. 
ARTHUR On display? I had to go down to a cellar! 
PROSSER That's the display department. 
ARTHUR I eventually found them in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door saying 'beware of the leopard'. 
PROSSER Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much damage that bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you? 
ARTHUR How much? 
PROSSER None at all. 
FORD (O.S.) (American accent) Arthur! 
(6 cont) BACK TO FORD IN THE PUB:                                      (6 cont) 
FORD Didn't you find it a little strange that I was trying to shake hands with a car? 
ARTHUR I assumed you were drunk. 
FORD (shaking his head) I thought cars were the dominant life form. I was trying to introduce myself. 
ARTHUR And that's why you're named after a discontinued car from the seventies? 
FORD (nodding) You saved my life that day.      Now I'm saving yours. 
Arthur just stares at him, then turns to his beer. 
ARTHUR This must be Thursday. I never could get the hang of Thursdays. 
FORD Look, if it's about your house... 
ARTHUR No, it's not that.    It's.... 
He shows Ford the photo of he and Tricia on his phone. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) I found her. Ford. The perfect girl. I found her, and then I let her get away. You remember that fancy dress party I told you about? 
FORD This isn't a long story, is it? We've only got six minutes. 
Arthur shakes his head.    Ford checks his watch.

FORD (CONT'D) Okay.     Talk and drink. Fancy dress party. 
ARTHUR At that flat in Islington. I told you about it. Last week, remember? 
FLASHBACK TO: 
8   INT. ISLINGTON FLAT - NIGHT                                     8 
Crowded flat.    Everyone is in costume.   Loud music BLARES. 
ARTHUR (V.O.) I can't bear those sort of parties, didn't want to go, would have much rather stayed home and, I don't know, brush the dog. Anything. But there I was -- and then, there she was... 
Arthur, dressed in safari attire complete with pith helmet, sits off to the side, observing, looking miserable. 
TRICIA (O.S.) Who are you? 
Arthur looks up. TRICIA MCMILLAN is dressed in a mid 19th century mens suit with mutton chop sideburns and is holding a taxidermy beagle -- and she still looks beautiful.   Arthur, ever the gentleman, stands. 
ARTHUR I'm Arthur. Arthur Dent. 
TRICIA No, I mean who are you? 
ARTHUR Oh, the costume. Right. Er, um... (sheepishly tipping his hat) Livingston, I presume. (pointing to her attire) Granted. Not as clever as Darwin, but the best I could do on short notice. 
TRICIA You're the first person who's got it right. Everyone keeps calling me Sherlock. 
ARTHUR Really? I thought the beagle made it rather obvious.

He pets the dog.    She smiles.    He smiles back. 
9   A CAMERA FLASH FLASHES.    JUMP CUT to...                     9 
THE BALCONY -- Arthur has just taken a digital photo of he and Tricia on his cell phone. They look at the screen image and laugh. 
ARTHUR (V.O.) (CONT'D) She was amazing, Ford. Witty, and beautiful, and brilliant. Four or five degrees. One in math, one in astrophysics, another in biology... 
TRICIA I've got so many degrees I am officially unemployable. Let's drink to that! 
They clink their wine glasses, take sips, continue to chat. 
ARTHUR (V.O.) And just as I was asking myself, "Why is this stunning and intelligent woman even giving me the time of day, out of nowhere she says... 
TRICIA Let's go somewhere. 
ARTHUR Yeah. It is a bit noisy. There's a lovely little cafe around the corner... 
TRICIA I was thinking Madagascar. 
ARTHUR Is that a new club on Dean Street? 
TRICIA No. It's a country.    Off the coast of Africa. 
ARTHUR Oh, that Madagascar. Right, off we go then. (then realizing...) Good God, you're serious. 
Picture mission control in Houston. WORKERS scramble. Monitors line the wall showing hundreds of news reports from around the globe; panic, chaos and pandemonium. 
Suddenly, there's a loud HUM through the speakers, followed by loud GARGLES and SCREECHING. Then... 
JELTZ {THROUGH SPEAKERS) People of Earth, this is Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic Hyperspace planning council. 
13       INT. A SUBURBAN BREAKFAST ROOM. CONTINUOUS                   13 
A FAMILY at breakfast, baffled that their cutlery, bowls and glasses resonate with the sound of Jeltz's voice. 
JELTZ (VOICE ONLY) As you are probably aware, plans for the development of the outlying regions of the galaxy involve the building of a hyperspace express route through your star system... 
14       EXT. OXFORD STREET ELECTRONICS STORE - CONTINUOUS            14 
Several PATRONS watch the wall of TV's, all projecting a snowy, distorted image. Jeltz's voice blares through the speakers. 
JELTZ ...and, unfortunately, your planet is one of those scheduled for demolition. The process will take slightly less than two of your Earth minutes. Thank you. 
Through the window behind them, throngs of people stampede down Oxford Street, screaming.

5   EXT. SATELLITE TRACKING STATION                               15 
A TECHNICIAN speaks urgently into a microphone while his co-workers watch the chaos on the monitors behind. 
TECHNICIAN Hello! Can you hear us? Please respond! 
16      INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS               16 
The VOGON BRIDGE is like a waterlogged old Skoda. 
JELTZ (INTO THE P.A.) There's no point in acting all surprised about it. The plans and demolition orders have been on display at your local planning office in Alpha Centauri for fifty of your Earth years, so you've had plenty of time to lodge formal complaints. 
17      EXT. FIELD BY ARTHUR'S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS                      17 
Ford grabs hold of Arthur's shirt, extends the Thumb. 
18      INT. THE PUB. CONTINUOUS                                      18 
PULL BACK FROM JUKE BOX.     The pub seems deserted. 
VOGON CAPTAIN (through juke box) What do you mean you've never been to Alpha Centauri? Oh, for heaven's sake mankind, it's only four light years away you know. I'm sorry, but if you can't be bothered to take an interest in local affairs that's your own lookout. 
PULL BACK FARTHER - people lay on the ground with PAPER BAGS on their heads. 
19      INT. VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP BRIDGE. -- CONTINUOUS             19 
Jeltz turns.   He's large, green and walrusy. 
JELTZ Apathetic bloody planet, I've no sympathy at all. Energize the demolition beams. 
One of his walrusy FIRST OFFICERS pushes a yellow button. 
20      BIG SHOT.   FROM SPACE.    LOOKING DOWN ON EARTH              20 
As all the Vogon ships simultaneously send down a beam of yellow light. Glowing fireballs travel down the beams toward Earth. On impact, they bore into the surface. 
JELTZ (O.S.) Detonate.

Like a giant casino going down in Vegas, there are a few small explosions AMD THE EARTH IMPLODES. Just collapses in on itself. Gone. 
The Vogon ships slowly retreat in formation, leaving nothing but DARKNESS AND STARS. 
21      Then a distant RED GLOW appears. As it gets nearer we       21 see that it says..."THE HITCHHIKERS GUIDE TO THE GALAXY." 
GUIDE VOICE The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a wholly remarkable book... 
The title draws nearer. We see that it sits on an electronic book with lots of buttons. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) ...Perhaps the most remarkable, certainly the most successful book ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of Ursa Minor. 
The book opens revealing TWO SCREENS. Images appear. A star map, layers of data, captions, video, animations... 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) More popular than the CELESTIAL HOME CARE OMNIBUS, better selling than 53 MORE THINGS TO DO IN ZERO GRAVITY, and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's trilogy of philosophical blockbusters, WHERE GOD WENT WRONG, SOME MORE OF GOD'S GREATEST MISTAKES, and WHO IS THIS GOD PERSON, ANYWAY? 
Now the images rise up from the screen like holographs as the book "presents itself" like some hi-tech infomercial. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) In many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, the Hitchhiker's Guide has already supplanted the great Encyclopedia Galactica as the standard repository of all knowledge and wisdom. For though it has many omissions, and contains much which is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate, it scores over the older, more pedestrian work in two important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper. And second, it has the words "DON'T PANIC" printed in large friendly letters on its cover. 
The book closes. The words "DON'T PANIC" appear just below the title, blinking like a tacky diner marquee. 
PULL BACK FROM THE GUIDE to find Arthur holding it, the blinking light illuminating his very disoriented face.

2   INT. HOLD OF VOGON CONSTRUCTOR SHIP - NIGHT                        22 
Arthur, in total shock, holds up the guide. 
FORD (CONT'D) We've got to get off this ship before the Vogons find us. Vogons hate hitchhikers. Which is why they make ships with walls that won't allow the Sub-Etna signal to pass through. So we've got to send the signal up and out if we wanna catch a ride. Pull. 
They both pull. A section of pipe snaps off. Steam shoots out. Ford holds the black Thumb under the pipe. 
ARTHUR What's a Vogon? 
FORD Ask the guide.    Say "Vogons." 
Ford continues turning dials.        Arthur lifts the Guide. 
ARTHUR "Vogons." 
The word "VOGONS" floats up into his field of vision. 
GUIDE VOICE Vogons.

CHARACTER, HISTORY, HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH, HOW TO ANNOY, WHAT TO AVOID. Arthur touches CHARACTER. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) Vogons are one of the most unpleasant races in the Galaxy - not evil, but bad- tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public inquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as fire-lighters. 
Arthur touches 'HOW TO HAVE FUN WITH.' 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is to stick your finger down his throat. 
Arthur touches 'WHAT TO AVOID'. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) On no account should you allow a Vogon to read poetry to you. 
FORD They can't think, they can't imagine, most of them can't even spell. They just run things. (turns dial opposite direction) And if we don't get a ride soon, you won't b need the guide to illustrate just how unpleasant the Vogons can be. They've destroyed a planet today, that always makes them a little feisty. 
ARTHUR It can't be gone. It can't be! (grabbing the Guide, shouting} Earth! 
FORD Shhh! 
ARTHUR EARTH!! 
GUIDE VOICE Earth. 
An image of the Earth appears on the Guide's screen. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) Harmless. 
Arthur waits...and waits.    The Earth image fades away.

ARTHUR That's it? That's all this idiotic book has to say about my home? "Harmless?" 
FORD Hey, there are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy and only a limited amount of space in the book's microprocessors. No one knew much about Earth. That's why I was there. To expand the entry. I fired off a new one to the editor before I got stranded. 
ARTHUR What does it say now? 
FORD Mostly harmless. 
Before Arthur can react, a speaker HUMS to life with screeching HOWLS and GARGLES. Arthur cups his ears. 
ARTHUR Ahhh, what the hell is that?! 
FORD Here.   Put this in your ear. 
Ford removes a small yellow fish from his pouch. He moves to put it in Arthur's ear. Arthur struggles. 
ARTHUR WHAT?...STOP!..DON'T COME NEAR ME WITH... 
The LOUD GARGLING NOISE continues. Ford has to wrestle to get the fish in Arthur's ear. 
JELTZ (ON SPEAKER) 
ARTHUR Argh!   What's happening...? 
As he succeeds, the noise mutates to the Vogon Captain's voice. Arthur looks incredulous. 
JELTZ (ON SPEAKER) This is your captain speaking, so stop whatever you're doing and pay attention! 
FORD The fish. It's translating for you. 
JELTZ (ON SPEAKER) According to our instruments we have unwittingly picked up a couple of hitchhikers who must be apprehended and...

ARTHUR And, um, interesting rhythmic devices which seemed to counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor of the humanity... 
FORD Vogonity! 
ARTHUR ... Vogonity, sorry. Vogonity of the poet's soul, which contrives through the medium of the verse structure to sublimate, er... 
FORD ... whatever it was ... 
ARTHUR ... the poem was about. 
Jeltz rubs one of his chins, then smiles and claps slowly. 
FORD Damn. 
ARTHUR What? 
FORD I think you just saved my life again. 
JELTZ An astute analysis. Very impressive. (turning to the Guard) Throw them off the ship. 
The guard grabs them, drags them out of the bridge. 
VOGON GUARD Resistance is useless! 
JELTZ Hmph. "Counterpoint the surrealism of the underlying metaphor..." Death's too good for them. 
Jeltz picks up his fishing rod, goes for another crab.

FORD Yes. No, wait! What's this switch? (reaching for it) No, it's nothing. We are going to die. 
Arthur sits for a moment, then oddly chuckles to himself. 
ARTHUR You know, it's at times like this, when I'm trapped in a Vogon airlock with a man from Betelgeuse and about to die of asphyxiation in deep space that I really wish I'd listened to what my mother told me when I was young. 
FORD Why? What did you she tell you? 
ARTHUR I don't know. I didn't listen. 
Ford folds his towel into a tiny square, holds it up toward Arthur. He raises an eyebrow. Will this help? 
FORD You're sweating. 
Ford dabs Arthur's brow. They stare forward at the airlock door. Long pause. Nothing happens. They look to each other. Shrug. They might be okay. Then -- PSSH. The bottom drops out. They're sucked down and out. 
30      EXT. DEEP SPACE -- CONTINUOUS                                   30 
Ford and Arthur spin away from the ship, holding their breath. The guide slips out of Arthur's pocket. 
GUIDE VOICE "Space..." says the introduction to the Hitchhikers Guide, "...is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the market, but that's just peanuts compared to space..." and so on. 
The weightless guide twirls away.    Arthur reaches for it. The words "DON'T PANIC" alight. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) It also says that if you hold a lung full of air you can survive in the total vacuum of space for about thirty seconds -- but with space being really big and all, the chances of being picked up within that time are 2 to the power of 2076775949 to 1 against...

Something else falls out of his pocket -- his digital phone with the photo of he and Tricia at the fancy dress party. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) ...which, by a staggering coincidence, is also the telephone number of the Islington flat where Arthur once went to a fancy dress party and met a very nice girl whom he totally failed to connect with. 
He reaches for the phone, it's just beyond his fingertips. His eyes widen with fret as the phone tumbles away. 
30a     Then -- WOOMPH -- space seems to stretch and bend. A tiny        30a hole appears, then opens wide. Paper hats and party balloons fall out, then drift away. The hole flips inside out. Arthur and Ford are enveloped, then replaced by a stunning, sleek starship, the HEART OF GOLD.

KWALTZ Get me the vice-president. 
Approximately 15 Vogons sit around the table murmuring sporadically. A VOGON MESSENGER runs up, holding papers. Kwaltz takes them, signs, signs the next page -- and the next. He hands them back to the messengers (who has been jogging in place the whole time). He runs off. The VOGON CAPTAIN appears on the large screen before him.

MARVIN (CONT'D) I've been ordered to take you up to the bridge. Here I am, brain the size of a planet, and they ask me to take you up to the bridge. Call that job satisfaction? - 'cause I don't. 
ZAPHOD Hey, hon. Come here. You won't believe this. Ix...um, sorry..."Ford"...this is... 
ARTHUR Tricia McMillan? 
She takes a closer look at him. 
TRILLIAN Arthur?

Arthur is stunned silent. He goes to her, making sure she's really there. He's speechless. She smiles and gives him a friendly embrace. 
ARTHUR (completely bewildered) I can't believe this...I've been looking...and you're here? I went to get wine and... 
TRILLIAN I know. And it was rude to just leave, but I told you I wanted to get away, and he had a spaceship parked outside, well, honestly -- I assumed you were a sort of stay-at-home-and-read-a book type. (hopeful) But you're here... 
Arthur smiles, then realizes with some regret... 
ARTHUR Actually -- I am that type. But...well you do know what happened, don't you? 
Zaphod stops in between them, puts his arm around Arthur. 
ZAPHOD --Ford picked him up, they hitched a ride, and here we all are. Now, enough small talk, Trill. We're on the run, remember? I stole a ship? 
ARTHUR We're having a bit of a chat if you don't mind. 
Arthur SHOVES Zaphod's hand off his shoulder. Oddly, Zaphod reacts with a smile. And then -- his head shoots all the up way revealing a second head that lives somewhere under his chin. 
ZAPHOD HEAD 2 You blew it with her, Earthman, so shut up or I'll kick you in the gones! 
FORD There's the Zaphod I remember. 
Arthur recoils in horror, instinctively raises his fists. 
Zaphod wrestles with Head 2 while A THIRD ARM springs out of Zaphod's chest and PUNCHES ARTHUR in the jaw. Arthur buckles and hits the floor. 
ZAPHOD HEAD 2 You should teach your pal a lesson, Ford. He's a guest on my ship. 
FORD I thought you said you stole it. (CONTINUED)

ZAPHOD HEAD 2 Fine.   Get technical. 
A KLAXON sounds. Red lights FLASH. Zaphod (Head 2) hurries to the console. Ford follows. 
Trillian hurries to Arthur who nurses his jaw. 
TRILLIAN Are you all right? 
ARTHUR I feel like a bloody idiot. I've spent all week looking for Tricia McMillan and that isn't even your name. 
TRILLIAN It is my name. I shortened it. 
ZAPHOD (0.S.) Trillian...! 
ARTHUR Well, I'm still Arthur. Just plain average one-headed doesn't-own-a-space ship Arthur. Sorry to disappoint. 
ZAPHOD (O.S.) A little help over here? 
Trillian leaves Arthur, joins Zaphod 
ZAPHOD HEAD 2 They're after us! Fire a gun! Launch a missile! DO SOME DAMAGE! 
Zaphod's arms struggle with his head again.

A very eager male COMPUTER VOICE (EDDIE) sounds. 
EDDIE Hi, guys, this is Eddie your shipboard computer and I just know I'm gonna get a bundle of kicks out of any program you want to run through me. 
TRILLIAN Can you identify our pursuers?

You must be super important to warrant such an effort, and gee am I impressed. They're sending a message. I'd be super happy to play it. 
ZAPHOD HEAD 2 Fine! Play it!! (to Trillian) This people personality thing is gonna drive me nuts! Can't you change it? 
She exits.    Arthur follows.       Zaphod steps back, blocking his way.

ARTHUR Arthur.

ZAPHOD Right.   No hard feelings, okay? And sorry to hear about your planet, but don't mention it to the girl because if you do I'll...I'll... 
He smiles broader.    Then Head 2 pops up and finishes... 
ZAPHOD HEAD 2 I'll pull your spleen out through your ass! 
Zaphod slams Head 2 back into place..then smiles again. Arthur furrows his brow and Zaphod and follows Trillian. 
FORD Two heads. Interesting choice. 
ZAPHOD Apparently you can't be President with a whole brain. 
FORD So you carved it up? 
ZAPHOD Yes -- I think. And I think I did it in such a way that it wouldn't be detected by the Government screening tests -- or by me. So, what's so secret that I can't let anybody know I know it, not the Galactic Government, not even myself? And the answer is-- (thinking) --I don't know. Obviously. But I put a few things together and that's when I realized I had this.

CLOSE ON - the NUTRI-MATIC MACHINE. Brownish liquid flows into it a Martini glass, topped with dry-ice fog. 
Arthur removes the glass.    Sips.     Grimaces 
TRILLIAN I suppose I should have said it resembles tea. 
ARTHUR So two heads is what does it for a girl, then? I mean, if I'd had two heads. Or three? 
TRILLIAN Or your own space ship.

TRILLIAN Come on, Arthur, don't be like that. 
ARTHUR Well, what am I supposed to be like? Green? Bleeping? What? 
TRILLIAN Just be yourself. Have some fun. Does it hurt? 
ARTHUR No, I suppose it wouldn't.. 
TRILLIAN I mean... 
She points to his jaw, he nods, she picks up her BACKPACK. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) I might have an aspirin. 
She unzips it. TWO MICE scurry out and scamper off, a hair-clip is clipped to one of the mice's tail. 
TRILLIAN (CONT'D) Hey.   What are they doing in there? 
Before she can catch them, they scurry under the door. 
TRILLIAN {CONT'D) They were from my lab at university.    Odd... 
ARTHUR So all that's left is me and you, "mostly harmless," and two lab rats. 
She furrows her brow.     What does he mean? 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Look, there's something I should tell you... 
ZAPHOD (O.S.) Showtime, Trill! 
TRILLIAN Can it keep? You might want to see this. 
Arthur nods. She leaves.        He looks at his "tea", throws it in the trash bin.

Trillian and Arthur join Ford and Zaphod at the computer. 
ZAPHOD --and when I saw what I'm about to show you, that's when I realized why I did what I did to my brain -- or it least, I think that's why. 
44      ON THE COMPUTER SCREEN --                                   44 
The screen brightens. A BRAND LOGO appears (a circle made of a dotted line with an "M" in the middle) then a sub- title: MAGRATHEAN PUBLIC ARCHIVE. Zaphod fast forwards until a noisy picture DISSOLVES TO... 
A knitted version of Arthur, Trillian, Ford and Zaphod sit in chairs before the ships console. 
KNITTED ZAPHOD (clutching stomach) Is this going to happen every time we hit that button? 
KNITTED TRILLIAN Very probably, yes. 
53      The air ripples. The 'knitted' crew flip back to their       53 former selves. Arthur pukes into a trash bin and with a sick expression, looks up to the screen. 
ARTHUR Did it work? Are we there? 
Now Zaphod looks -- and he's elated. 
ZAPHOD Yes!...I think.     Computer? 
EDDIE Hi, fella! 
Head 2 suddenly springs up. 
ZAPHOD HEAD 2 Can you please change that zarking annoying voice!!? 
TRILLIAN Computer? What planet is that, please? 
EDDIE CHECKING!! 
On-hold Muzak plays. They all sit and listen for a few beats, then Arthur yelps... 
ARTHUR OW!! (spinning around to Zaphod) Did you just pluck a hair from my head? 
ZAPHOD HEAD 2 Yeah, as if, apeman.

Arthur suddenly feels something on his back, leaps out of the chair and brushes it off. 
The two mice land on the floor across the ship, then scurry away down a hallway. Before Arthur can react... 
EDDIE Thanks for waiting, everyone. I'm just tickled pink to tell you we are currently in orbit around the planet Viltvodle 6.

Vogon crew quickly enter data. A FLIGHT ENGINEER gets something on his screen, shows it to the Captain. 
VOGON CAPTAIN Sir, the Heart of Gold has just requested permission to land on Viltvodle 6. Should I pursue? 
KWALTZ (ON MONITOR) That is not a request to which I can respond, captain. Should I pursue what? Are you requesting hyperspace clearance so that you may pursue the fugitive? 
VOGON CAPTAIN Yes, commander. 
KWALTZ (ON MONITOR) Then you must say that, captain -- in request form. 
VOGON CAPTAIN Requesting hyperspace clearance to pursue the fugitive, sir. 
KWALTZ (ON MONITOR) Thank you. Request acknowledged.   Await response.

The war room is silent. We hear the sound of running above. The footsteps hurry all the way around, we hear a door open, running up more steps, along the corridor until and finally an exhausted Vogon Messenger bursts through the door holding a blue form. Questular shakes his head in disbelief as Kwaltz signs the request form.

KWALTZ According to Subsection 94b, paragraph 2, you're not authorized to make such an order. 
QUESTULAR But I'm acting president! 
KWALTZ Then act like a president, and do nothing. 
Kwaltz continues to fill out the forms. Questular grabs a clump of his hair -- and pulls it out.

All we can see are the lights of the Heart of Gold's entry ramp cutting through a dense fog. Or is it fog? 
Zaphod's 2nd head is up as he comes down the ramp ahead of the other three. 
ZAPHOD HEAD 2 Humma Kavula!

The gang run down an alley and hide behind a kiosk. Zaphod sports a goofy smile. Arthur is scared to death. 
ARTHUR Oh God, I really hate Thursdays. 
FORD Zaphod, what do we do? 
ZAPHOD Build bridges between the stars! He holds up two peace signs, a la Nixon. 
ARTHUR What? 
FORD I think that was his campaign slogan. 
Trillian finds a deodorant can, grabs it, gets an idea.

(62 cont) The police step backwards -- but the crowd takes a step       (62 cont) forward. A huddle of female ADMIRERS rush them, waving pens and paper as if the Beatles have arrived. 
ADMIRERS Mr. President, Mr. President!... 
Zaphod paints on a smile, breaks away from the others to go sign a few autographs. 
FEMALE ADMIRER I totally voted for you!

Shots are fired. The crowd SCREAMS and SCATTERS. Arthur reaches for Trillian but she is engulfed by Vogons who move, en masse, and pull her away into the mist. 
ARTHUR Tricia! 
Ford, with Zaphod in tow, shoves Arthur forward, using his towel to clear a path through the mist. They see the Heart of Gold ramp descending from the belly of the ship.

KWALTZ Bring her to Vogsphere for processing, Captain. 
The captain nods.      The screen goes black. 
QUESTULAR They're coming here!? But they've only accomplished half the mission. What about Zaphod? HE MUST FACE JUSTICE!! 
KWALTZ My instructions were clear... 
From a slot in his chair, he pulls his instructions -- signed in triplicate of course. He reads... 
KWALTZ (CONT'D) "Apprehend the kidnapper, rescue the president." We do them in that order. And until the kidnapper is properly processed, she isn't officially apprehended, now is she, Mr. Vice- President? 
Questular pulls out another small clump of hair.

Ford and Arthur drag Zaphod into the bridge. On the front screen, they can see the Vogon ships flying away. 
ARTHUR We have to go!     Let's GO! 
FORD Wow... 
MARVIN I know.    Dreadful, isn't it? 
ARTHUR Sorry about the landing.    Where are we? 
ZAPHOD Magrathea! 
FORD Wrong. This is the Vogon planet.     This is Vogsphere. 
ZAPHOD No.   It's Magrathea!   I know it! 
Ford reaches in his satchel, pulls out a sort of ELECTRONIC BERET, pulls it snugly onto Zaphod's head. 
FORD Little something I learned about on an Altairian star cruiser. Captains use them when they really need to concentrate. 
ARTHUR What is it? 
FORD A Thinking Cap. 
Zaphod squints hard to think as he looks around.

A TELESCOPIC ROD WITH A PADDLE AT THE TOP shoots out of the ground, SMACKS Arthur on the face, then retracts. 
Arthur is stunned. None of the others have noticed. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Did anyone see that? 
ZAPHOD See what? 
They look at Arthur. It suddenly seems ridiculous. 
ARTHUR Nothing. 
They all walk along - Arthur at the back, perplexed. 
FORD What was it? 
ARTHUR Nothing. Just my imagination. 
Another paddle springs up, double smack in the face. Arthur leaps back. Looks down. Nothing. Nothing at all. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Alright, stop. Everyone stop and watch me. Something's happening. 
They watch.    Arthur walks. And walks.

Trillian sits at the Officer's desk, arms folded, defiant. 
TRILLIAN I don't believe you. This is some sort of trick. Zaphod wouldn't blow up a planet, especially mine. 
Kwaltz now steps forward and extends a piece of paper. 
KWALTZ These are the orders. 
Trillian takes the paper, runs her finger down to the signature line where it reads "Love and kisses, Zaphod!" 
TRILLIAN Love and kisses...? 
She hands the paper back, swallowing emotion. 
KWALTZ Now -- according to Section 8, sub-section 34 dash A, the punishment for kidnapping is a recitation of the classic poem, "Ode to the Removal of Your Left Kidney." Unless -- said kidnapping is of the President, in which case you are to be fed to the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal. We thank you for your cooperation. 
A door is opened revealing a room with a large steel box. A huge, angry eye stares out of a tiny barred window. 
The box shakes like crazy. Trillian gulps.

Arthur steps up, followed by Ford and Zaphod who keeps his head low and bowed. 
ARTHUR Yes. Hi. We're here about getting a prisoner released? 
FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR Prisoner release form?

FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR No.     Next! 
Arthur sighs, frustrated. All three of them walk to the shelves holding the forms. Arthur turns to Zaphod. 
ARTHUR Can't you do something?!     You're President, aren't you? 
ZAPHOD You want me to make a speech, shake a hand? That's what I do -- I think. It's all a little fuzzy. 
Arthur angrily fills out the form. 
MOMENTS LATER-- 
Arthur is back in line, having waited a long time. He finally gets to the window, hands the green form to the Vogon Processor. She types into her computer, then checks the screen. 
FEMALE VOGON PROCESSOR This Prisoner is being detained for... (reading) Kidnapping the president. Not eligible for release at this time. You can make an appointment for a later date or take a number and wait. 
Arthur's breathing quickens.     He can't take this. 
ARTHUR Alright, look. (yanks thinking cap and sunglasses off Zaphod) This is the President. 
She looks at Zaphod, then back to the large portrait of Zaphod, then back to Zaphod. She nods. Okay... 
ARTHUR   (CONT'D) He says the whole kidnapping thing was a terrible misunderstanding, she didn't mean anything by it and he's ordering you to let her go.

Stars appear on the screen as they slow from hyperspace. 
EDDIE Guys, I'm just super happy to tell you we're approaching hyperspace exit Gamma Z8B530. 
Arthur steadies himself, turns to Trillian who's still staring forward, angry. She unbuckles her seat-belt and moves away from the console. 
A planet appears on screen.     Zaphod and Ford lean forward. 
ZAPHOD Okay, that's it...I think. Computer?      Is that...where are we headed again? 
FORD Magrathea? 
EDDIE Hang on, fella, and I'll check.

Arthur turns, look over at... 
TRILLIAN -- who stares out a portal window into the emptiness of space. A tear rolls down her cheek. 
Arthur steps up, isn't sure what to say. 
ARTHUR Look, you're right. You deserved to know and I should've told you. I don't blame you if you're angry. 
She turns and stares, wipes the tears away.     Can't speak. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Right.   Anyway...I'm sorry. 
EDDIE (O.S.) Guys, it just tickles me pink to tell you we are currently in orbit at an altitude of three hundred miles around the legendary planet of Magrathea. Goll-ee. 
Hearing this news, Arthur, Trillian and Ford turn. 
ZAPHOD (tasting it) Take us in. 
83a     EXT. NIGHT DEEP SPACE - MAGRATHEA                              83a 
They all stare in awe as they move toward a planet which gets closer and closer. Suddenly, their faces are awash with light. 
WOOMF! Light blasts through the bridge. Morphing madness!

Empty for a moment. Then, the HEART OF GOLD reforms. A few beats later, a SPERM WHALE floats into frame followed by a BOWL OF PETUNIAS.

It coalesces back into shape out of chaos. The safety dome rises revealing our heroes standing in the exact same place they were - dazed. 
ZAPHOD Um...where are we? 
TRILLIAN Exactly where we were, I think. 
ZAPHOD And the missiles? 
FORD Have apparently turned into a bowl of petunias and a very surprised looking whale. 
He points to the screen. The whale and petunias float by. 
EDDIE At an improbability factor of eight million, seven hundred and sixty-seven thousand, one hundred and twenty-eight to one against. 
They all look to Arthur who shrugs. Zaphod nods his approval. Ford counts on his fingers -- are they even? 
He waves it off, gives Arthur a little salute and moves on. Trillian looks to Arthur and musters a smile. 
ARTHUR I could really use a cup of tea. 
88      EXT. SPACE - NIGHT                                          88 
The H.O.G. arches away. The whale in mid-air, stops rising, starts falling. 
GUIDE VOICE It is important to note that suddenly, and against all probability, a sperm whale had been called into existence several miles above the surface of an alien planet. And since this is not a naturally tenable position for a whale, this innocent creature had very little time to come to terms with its identity as a whale before it then had to come to terms with suddenly not being a whale any more. This is what it thought as it fell. 
The camera moves around the whale as it falls.

What do I mean by who am I? What is this 'I' that I want to know what it is? Calm down, get a grip now ... ooh! This is an interesting sensation... 
ANGLE: From below. The whale is wriggling a bit. 
WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Oh! This is an interesting sensation, what is it? It's a sort of... yawning, tingling sensation in ... well I suppose I'd better start finding names for things if I want to make any headway in what for the sake of what I shall call an argument I shall call the world, so let's call it my stomach! Good. Ooooh! It's getting quite strong now. And hey,what's this whistling roaring sound going past what I'm suddenly going to call my head? Perhaps I can call that ... wind! Is that a good name? It'll do. Perhaps I can give it a better name later when I've found out what it's for! It must be very important because there certainly seems to be an awful lot of it. Hey! What's this thing ... this ... let's call it a tail - yeah! Tail! 
The whale thrashes its tail. Between the camera and the whale drops the bowl of petunias. It falls from sight. 
WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Hey! I can really thrash it about pretty good, can't I? Wow! Wow! Doesn't seem to achieve much but I'll probably find out what it's for later on. How. Have I built up a coherent picture of things yet? No. Never mind. Hey, this is really exciting, so much to find out about, ao much to look forward to, I'm quite dizzy with anticipation ... Or is it the wind? There really is an awful lot of that now, isn't there? 
It's eye tries to look down. Camera pulls back from the whale, abandoning it ... 
WHALE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And hey! What's this thing coming suddenly coming towards me very fast, so big and flat and round it needs a big wide-sounding name like ... ow ... ound...round ... ground! That's it, ground! I wonder if it'll be friends with me?

GUIDE VOICE Curiously, the only thing that went through the mind of the bowl of petunias as it fell was "Oh no, not again." 
We hear the petunia vase SHATTERING. 
GUIDE VOICE (CONT'D) Many have speculated that if we knew why the bowl of petunias had thought that we would know a lot more about the nature of the Universe than we do now. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
89      EXT. HEART OF GOLD. MAGRATHEA SURFACE - DAY                   89 
The gang stand by A HUGE CRATER (the H.O.G. parked in the b.g.) -- a large whale carcass sits in the middle of it -- along with a few petunias. They all grimace. 
BEYOND THE CRATER -- they see a formation of large rocks, aligned in a circle. It's the only structure in sight. 
They walk toward it. 
90      EXT. ROCK FORMATION - DAY                                     90 
Arthur walks behind the others, his head down. 
FORD (O.S.) Hey...this looks familiar. 
Arthur looks up, registers surprise. 
THE ROCK FORMATION -- looks like Stonehenge - only newer. The rocks letters carved into them that read "DESIGN DEPARTMENT" "SHOWROOM" "EXECUTIVE OFFICES" "TOILETS" 
FORD (CONT'D} Must be portal doors. 
ARTHUR You mean -- the hippies were right? 
In the middle of the circle sits a stone receptionist desk with a sign on it that says "OUT TO LUNCH." 
Arthur looks up at Marvin. 
ARTHUR So this is how it will all end, then? Me, on a dead planet -- with a manically depressed robot. 
MARVIN You think you've got problems? What are you supposed to do if you are a manically depressed robot? No, don't bother to answer that, I'm fifty thousand times more intelligent than you and even I don't know the answer. It gives me a headache just trying to think down to your level. 
SLARTIBARTFAST    (0.S.) Excuse me. 
Arthur spins to see AN OLD, BEARDED MAN IN LONG ROBES. 
ARTHUR Aah! 
He jumps, crab walks backwards away from the man. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Who are you? 
SLARTIBARTFAST My name is not important. 
Arthur continues to scramble away from the man. 
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D) You must come with me. Terrible events are afoot. You must come or you'll be late. 
ARTHUR Late? What for? 
SLARTIBARTFAST What is your name, Earthman?

SLARTIBARTFAST Late   as in "the late Dentarthurdent." It's   a sort of threat you see. Never been much   good at them myself, but I'm told they   can be terribly effective. 
He motions to the stone that is marked "To Showroom." 
SLARTIBARTFAST (CONT'D) Your friends are safe. You can trust me. 
ARTHUR Trust a man who won't tell me his name? 
SLARTIBARTFAST My name? Very well... (heaves a sigh, reluctant) My name is...Slartibartfast. 
Arthur reacts with a furrowed brow. 
SLARTIBARTFAST(CONT'D) I said it wasn't important. 
Slartibartfast motions to the door.     He looks to Marvin. 
MARVIN I could calculate your chances of survival -- but you won't like it. 
Arthur rises, cautiously moves over to Slarti's side. 
SLARTIBARTFAST I must warn you. We are about to pass through, well, a sort of gateway thing. It may disturb you. It scares the willies out of me. 
He puts his hand on a certain spot in the stone and presses. The stone dissolves revealing once again the jet engine swirling vortex. Slarti motions -- after you. 
Arthur takes a deep breath -- and steps in. 
ARTHUR Whaa! 
He is bent, twisted and sucked away.     Slarti follows. 
Marvin stands for a moment, then looks up to...

Arthur is hunched over a litter bin, barfing. 
SLARTIBARTFAST I told you you might find it a bit disturbing. 
ARTHUR I have found this whole day a bit disturbing. 
Arthur realizes he has his towel with him. He wipes his mouth with it, dabs his brow. Then he notices... 
...THE ROOM -- which is like a car dealer's showroom only instead of cars there are models of various planets. 
SLARTIBARTFAST Did you know we built planets?

Zaphod looks up.    Deep Thought is shushing him? 
DEEP THOUGHT (CONT'D) The show's back on. 
A robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume. 
Zaphod stands, turns to Ford and Trillian, smiles that smile -- but it's starting to look a bit crazed. 
ZAPHOD Great. This is just great. Let's go find something else for my entire life to be about. 
He starts to march off.    Ford grabs his arm. 
FORD Zaphod. The gun? The one Humma sent us for? We have to get it. You gave the guy your head. 
ZAPHOD I know.    Why did I do that? 
He pulls his thinking cap down -- all the way over his eyes. Ford rolls his eyes, turns... 
FORD Um...Deep Thought? We we're told you have a g... 
Before he finishes the sentence, a PANEL in the wall slides open revealing a LARGE, SCARY LOOKING GUN. A robotic arm pushes it forward. 
Ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's nitroglycerin to Zaphod who's already walking away, 
CORRIDOR LEADING AWAY FROM DEEP THOUGHT 
Ford hands Zaphod the gun. 
FORD (CONT'D) Here.     Take it. I don't do guns. 
Zaphod takes it with a smile... 
ZAPHOD Thank you. 
...and instantly points it at his head. Ford lunges for it. There's a struggle. Ford's trying to get Zaphod's finger off the trigger when CLICK! The trigger is pulled. Ford winces. But apparently, nothing has happened.

The transport cart moves past two half-finished planets and on toward a 3rd planet. Construction gantries and clouds obscure our view. 
SLARTIBARTFAST The galaxy was a bit of a shambles, you see. Everyone enjoying themselves being singers and comedians and really creative and interesting things like that. No one doing the boring jobs. 
ARTHUR Oh, you had that problem, too? 
SLARTIBARTFAST In spades. So a species was genetically engineered to do the boring jobs. Tax inspectors, traffic wardens, government officials. We were commissioned to build a special planet for them. Problem was, some cleverdick made it so any time one of the creatures had an interesting idea it would get a hefty smack around the face. 
ARTHUR What? You did that? I've been there! 
The cart lowers down toward the surface of the planet. 
SLARTIBARTFAST Then I gather you've met some of the inhabitants.

SLARTIBARTFAST These creatures you call "mice" are merely the protrusion into our dimension of hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings. The whole business with the cheese must've been a front. They were experimenting on you, you see. A vast computer program... 
ARTHUR Ah. I see where you're confused.    You see -- we were experimenting on them. 
101e      Over the ocean, a "Perfect Storm" wave rolls toward them.      101e 
SLARTIBARTFAST Oh, I gather they arranged for you to conduct some primitively staged experiments so they could prod your thinking here and there. But you were actually elements in the computer program. They really are very clever hyper- intelligent pan-dimensional beings. (looking down) Ah. They've nearly finished the oceans. 
101f      They move toward the white cliffs of Dover. A man stands       101f on a cliff holding a giant hose, water spewing from it. 
ARTHUR So -- you're trying to tell me that mice designed and built Deep Thought...and Deep Thought designed the Earth...which was a giant supercomputer...that you built...to calculate the Ultimate Question. Only, Vogons destroyed it ten minutes before the program was completed? 
SLARTIBARTFAST That's bureaucracy for you. 
ARTHUR Actually, this explains a lot. All my life I've had this strange feeling that something was going on in the world, something big, something sinister ... 
SLARTIBARTFAST That's just perfectly normal paranoia. Everyone in the universe has that.

I'd much rather be happy than right any day. 
ARTHUR And are you? 
SLARTIBARTFAST No. That's where it all falls down of course. (slowing the platform) Here we are, then. 
l03      The platform slows to a stop.      Arthur steps out and is     103 stunned to see... 
HIS HOUSE. It's partially constructed. The chimney lies intact on the ground, waiting to be hoisted up. A row of hedges lies on it's side beside a trench. But it's his house alright.

Slartibartfast nods.      Arthur, in a daze, stumbles toward the house.

They can't seem to stop eating, like they've been drugged. 
ARTHUR Hosts attack you --? And then you sit down for -- is that tea? 
Arthur has spotted a TEA POT on the table. He hurries to it, feels it. Warm. He pours a cup, takes a sip, Closes his eyes, enjoying it. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Now that's a cup of tea. 
FRANKY MOUSE (O.S.) We're glad you like it, Earth creature. 
He looks down and sees THE TWO WHITE MICE sitting on a silver platter. 
BENJY MOUSE After ten million years on Earth, and a rather large chunk of that time in England, it would be utterly humiliating if we didn't know how to make a decent pot of tea. 
Arthur stares in shock...can't speak. 
TRILLIAN Arthur, these are our hosts. Benjy mouse and Franky mouse (chew, chew). They control a large sector of the Universe in our dimension (chew, chew). I'm sorry, I thought you were told about the mice... 
ARTHUR Yes. Yes, I was. I just wasn't quite prepared for the full reality of it. 
He steadies himself on the table. 
BENJY MOUSE Sit, Earthman. Eat. 
Benjy pushes his hand through the air, the chair at the end slides backward. 
ARTHUR In a moment, perhaps.   I can't seem to let go of this table. 
Slartibartfast steps forward.

ROLL CREDITS OVER: 
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAWN 
VARIOUS EXTRA CLOSE-UPS of this luxurious patchwork of brilliant greens: 
A POLISHED BRASS SPRINKLER HEAD 
pops up from the ground and begins to water the already dew- soaked lawn. 
FLEET OF DUCKLINGS 
No mother in sight, cruise through the thrushes. 
GRAVEYARD OF GOLF BALLS, UNDERWATER 
At the bottom of a water hazard. 
PALM FRONDS 
After a neat they sway, revealing the barren desert that surrounds the artificial oasis. The sun already bakes the air. We hear the opening guitar strains of the Kim Deal-Kurt Cobain suet of "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE," as we CRANE DOWN the palms to 
A BRAND-NEW TITLEIST 3 BALL. 
Just on the edge of the rough. A pair of yellow trousers moves in. An iron confidently addresses the ball, and chips it out. The trousers walk out after it. 
HANDS 
Digging dirt out of the grooves of the iron's face with a golf tee, while on the way to the green. Both hands are gloved, instead of one, and the gloves are black. 
YELLOW TROUSERS 
In a squat over the ball, sizing up the curvy, fifty-foot journey to the hole. The figure positions himself and the putter above the ball, then pops the ball lightly. The ball rolls and bobs with purpose toward the hole, dodging hazards and finding lanes, until it finally falls off of the green and into the hole. 
THE GLOVED HAND 
Sets the ball on the next tee. The figure moves to a leather golf bag. The hands pull the wipe rag off of the top of the bag and drop it on the ground, reach into the bag, drawing out a compact SNIPER RIFLE, affixed with a long silencer. The figure drops one knee down onto the rag, the other foot firmly setting its spikes. We move the figure to see the face of the sniper, concentrating down the scope in his half- squat. He is MARTIN BLANK. 
We SWING AROUND behind his head to look down the barrel with him. Four-hundred yards away, on another part of the course, another green is barely visible through groves of trees and rough. Three miniscule, SILVER-HAIRED FIGURES come into view. One of them, in a RED SWEATER sets up for first putt. He could be an investment banker, or an arms trader. 
MARTIN'S ARM 
Flinches, and a low THUNK reports from the rifle. A second later in the distance, the 
RED SWEATER'S HEAD 
Seems to vanish from his shoulders into a crimson mist. His body crumples to the green. 
MARTIN 
Returns the rifle to the bag, pulls out a driver, moves to the tee and whacks the ball. He watches its path and whispers absently... 
MARTIN Hooked it. 
INT. CLUB HOUSE PATIO - LATER 
The outdoor post-golf luncheon area of an elite Texas golf club. Martin sits in on the fringes of a conversation between a group of executive types. CLUB MEMBER #1 has a Buddha-like peace in his eyes through the philosophical talk. 
CLUB MEMBER #1 I'd come to the realization that everything I'd based my life on was false. And that my life had no meaning. 
CLUB MEMBER #2 (to Martin) He gets this way when he hits over eighty-five. 
CLUB MEMBER #1 It seemed like my life was slipping away, somehow. I was a knot in the middle of a wet rope. Everything was futile and nothing had value. 
CLUB MEMBER #3 That's the way life is. The only meaning and value is what we create. Through structure, and discipline. Though they seem to limit our freedom, they actually give us great comfort. Your problem is you're looking for some great answer. Some ultimate truth. When what you really should do is go to work and go home. 
MARTIN I work alone. 
DRIVER That's it then. That's it. I've always been alone. That's why I'm a good driver. I can handle it. See, I can think on my feet. I survive, I'm a thinker. And I can sit there in front of your house for two hours and it don't bother me. Some people can't do it! Some people are ranting and raving, "Tell them fuckin' people to get out here and get in this car, I can't-- I want a go!" Where you gonna go? You're gonna wind up back in your garage at seven o'clock at night. You ain't going nowhere. You leave your house in the morning you get back to your house in the evening. What's the big deal, right? 
MARTIN You understand the psychology of the job. 
DRIVER I do. Some guys can't adjust to it; they can't handle it. 
INT. CAR - MANHATTAN STREETS - LATER 
The car cuts through the upper east side. Martin and the Driver exchange looks through the rear-view mirror. 
DRIVER You look like you're far away. Far away and thinking about other things. I'm right about that, aren't I? 
MARTIN No. 
DRIVER Well, let's just say that sometimes I'm right. Sometimes you are. 
MARTIN Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural. 
DRIVER (laughs to himself at this great truth) It's only natural.... 
The Driver pauses for dramatic emphasis 
DRIVER I been looking at you, and I've decided that I want to share something with you. 
MARTIN Okay. 
DRIVER Because your problem is you're bored. And you have a very big mind. (beat) I am part of what I call a brain syndicate. 
No reaction from Martin. 
DRIVER I am part of a network of minds, a group of five people who are all connected, over hundreds, even thousands of miles, through the mind. We can think with each other, think for each other. I can be driving somewhere, sleeping with a woman-- whatever it is-- and at the same time be thinking a thought in someone else's mind, far away. Running someone else's brain. 
MARTIN (indicates) Up on the right. 
DRIVER And when you think of it, it's not so surprising that a small group of people control the whole world, is it? 
INT. HOTEL ROOM, NEW YORK CITY - DAY 
A sedate and well-appointed four-star suite on the Upper East Side. Martin stands in front of one of the open windows watching the canopied entrance of an elegant high-rise across the street. He lifts an eye rinse cup to his eye and tilts it back. A cellular phone RINGS, interrupting him. He moves to the desk and draws one of three phones from his briefcase, depresses a scrambler module, flips it open, and listens for a moment. 
MARTIN If it's not there, I can't proceed. Tell them. 
Martin hangs up. Picks up another phone and dials. As he waits for an answer, he goes to a Fed Ex blueprint tube lying on the bed. 
MARTIN Tom. I've been waiting for an answer. I'm only in town tonight. 
He breaks the shipping seal and pulls out a series of finished metal parts including a long thin barrel, a scope, and a silencer. 
MARTIN What's different this time than the last time? I have to be down front... 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - SAME 
Martin stands in front of the window, phone in one hand, the scope in the other. Next to him, the assembled rifle rests across the arm of a chair. 
MARTIN ...I don't bother to call anyone else because you always take care of me. 
He glances over to a second window to his left, which offers a view further down the street. He goes to it. He raises the scope and sees 
MARTIN'S P.O.V./SCOPE- WINDOW #2 
A few blocks down, small even through the high-powered scope, is your average BICYCLE MESSENGER dressed in lycra racing gear, weaving through traffic toward us. Slung low across his right hip is a black canvas bag. The Messenger's hand is hidden in it. The other phone begins to RING. 
MARTIN Hold on a second, Tom. I got my hands full here. 
He sets down the phone and answers the other, still watching the messenger. 
MARTIN Good. Account number 3649367, transfer to account number 96-546-38739-47825. Ask for Mr. Sanchez, tell him it's Mr. Duckman. If there are any problems, access file 673594638-IO- 98, and look at it. 
Martin drops the phone and moves away from Window #2 to the rifle. He mounts the scope and he looks out Window #1 at the high-rise. 
now wearing rich man's sweats, hops off the loading dock, walks to a Lincoln Town Car, and drives off. 
INT. MARTIN'S AND GROCERS CARS - DAY 
Martin rolls down FDR Drive in a Lincoln Town Car once again on the cellular. 
MARTIN ...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella. 
MARCELLA Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you. 
MARTIN Patch him through.... 
Martin notices another Town Car appears in the next lane. We recognize the Doorman behind the wheel, phone in hand. He is GROCER. 
MARTIN What do you want? 
GROCER I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts. 
MARTIN Like a union? 
GROCER Like a club. Work less, make more. 
MARTIN Thank you, no. 
GROCER We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor. 
MARTIN And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me.... 
Grocer ignores this. 
GROCER It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in. 
MARTIN Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild. 
GROCER I'm gonna get you, kid. 
Martin hangs up and pulls away. 
INT. AIRLINER - DAY 
Martin sits in first class, wiping his face and hands with an airline hot towel. He folds the wet cloth and once again speeds through the images from a thick stack of magazines. He looks up as he hears PILOT V.O.  It's seventy-six degrees and partly cloudy in Chicago this afternoon... 
INT. APARTMENT, CHICAGO - NIGHT 
Martin walks into a sparsely furnished apartment. He wearily drops his carry-on bag and briefcase in the hall. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Martin sits on a futon couch watching MTV with no sound. On the coffee table in front of him is a phalanx of vitamin bottles. Martin takes some capsules from each and washes them down with a reddish-orange beverage. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Martin lies on his back on the hardwood floor. His eyes are closed and he wears a set of headphones as he absently taps his chest. 
WOMAN (V.O.) "Dear Alumni: Can you believe it's been ten years? Where are you now...? 
After a moment, his eyes open, alerted. His head turns to the side, and his hands lightly cup the headphones. 
CLOSE-UP: WIRE 
from the headphones as it winds to a small metal box, with one unmarked switch and one amber light- definitely not a walkman. The wire continues out of the other side of the box, across the floor, connecting to a suction cup stuck to the floor. 
WOMAN (V.O.) ...Are you guiding an Outward Bound canoe trip like Brook Stinson? Or perhaps in charge of appearances for the NFL like Leslie Gunther....? 
MARTIN - A MINUTE LATER 
draws a pre-cut section of the floor, the width of a pencil and twice as long, by a string. 
VIDEO MONITOR - A MINUTE LATER 
The greenish Starlight (night vision) image of a young, HUSKY MAN sleeping on his back, as seen from above. A fine thread snakes from behind CAMERA to just above the man's slack mouth. We PULL BACK to reveal a Sony Watchman that holds the IMAGE. KEEP PULLING to reveal Martin watching it as he maneuvers the thread down past the fiber-optic cable through the hole in the floor. 
INT. BLANK HOLDING COMPANY 
A small suite of dry-walled offices. 
EAST-WEST HOLDING COMPANY 
is stenciled on glass doors behind Martin who stands in front of a young woman reading from some kind of invitation. She is MARCELLA MAYES. 
MARCELLA ...So come on back to the old oak tree, acorns. Signed, the reunion committee." 
Marcella holds up the mauve envelope and smiles slyly. For the first time, Martin looks scared. 
MARTIN Throw that away. 
MARCELLA This? 
MARTIN Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living. 
MARCELLA It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip? 
MARTIN Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail. 
MARCELLA All of it? 
MARTIN And not show it to me. Ever again. 
MARCELLA That's going to cost. 
MARTIN I'll pay. 
Martin begins to walk past her into his office, but Marcella stops him. 
MARCELLA They're not happy, sir. 
MARTIN I'm not happy. 
MARCELLA They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep. 
MARTIN He didn't. 
MARCELLA They blame you for the compromise. 
MARTIN And they want me to make up for it. 
MARCELLA In Detroit. This weekend. 
MARTIN Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time. 
MARCELLA They were very upset. 
MARTIN Would you describe their position as inflexible? 
MARCELLA Intractable, sir. You leave tonight. 
Marcella looks concerned. 
MARCELLA And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one.... 
MARTIN There's nothing to be done about it. 
MARCELLA I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia. 
MARTIN Good. What else? Anything interesting? 
MARCELLA Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one. 
She hands him a piece of paper. He scans it. 
MARCELLA Enough? 
MARTIN Never enough. 
DR. OATMAN How do you know? 
MARTIN I just know. 
DR. OATMAN Say more. 
MARTIN They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say? (sarcastic) "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork." 
Oatman twitches nervously, almost spilling his coffee. 
DR. OATMAN You needn't be so frank with me about your work. 
MARTIN Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live. 
DR. OATMAN You know where I live? 
MARTIN We're both professionals, Oatman. 
DR. OATMAN I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens."  So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families. 
MARTIN So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around? 
DR. OATMAN Yes. 
MARTIN Mmm. 
Beat. 
DR. OATMAN And how have you been feeling about your... work lately? 
MARTIN Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me. 
INT. CHURCH - 
SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS: 
MARTIN 
From the back of the darkened empty church, we see him mount the altar.  A priest in fact. 
MARTIN'S HANDS 
open the gilded doors to reveal the chalice. He removes it, squirts a clear liquid into the cup, and swishes it out. He returns the chalice to the cabinet. 
MARTIN (V.O.) The church seems to be purging itself of it's pedophile. 
MARTIN 
Sits in the back pew of the church, now crowded for Mann. He watches the PRIEST lift the chalice into the air, murmur a prayer, and drink from it. The Priest collapses behind the altar. 
MARTIN (V.O.) It's a bull market. 
C.U. OF ALTAR CARPET 
The chalice bounces free from the Priest's hand as it hits the ground. 
MARTIN (V.O.) Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys. 
DR. OATMAN (V.O.) Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed. 
INT. OATMAN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
MARTIN If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway. 
DR. OATMAN What stuff? 
MARTIN (dismissive) Morality. 
Oatman's glad the session's just about over. 
DR. OATMAN Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel. 
Grocer leans back in his chair and sips the juice. After a moment, the FAX machine on the desk rattles. The computer beeps. 
"confirmation number of wire transfer#: AJ6687-OI99471" 
Grocer hits the return button after taking in the number. A graphic appears: 
"Connection is terminated/ Status idle" 
Grocer's FAX begins to moan and chatter. Grocer raises his juice glass to the computer in a lazy toast. 
INT. PLANE - NIGHT 
Martin reclines in first class, soaring toward the Midwest on the red-eye. He has already scanned his magazines and they are piled in the empty seat next to him. He sets aside a Powerbar. Martin reads Kill Without Joy. After a moment, he sets the book down and takes up Iron John. 
INT. DETROIT AIRPORT TERMINAL - EARLY MORNING 
At the edge of the airport bar sits LARDNER and MCCULLERS, two Government Spooks, agency unknown. They are both in blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing crowd. 
LARDNER You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man. 
MCCULLERS Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though. 
LARDNER Lisbon? 
MCCULLERS In Portugal, yes. 
In the background, Martin passes by them as he walks down the hall. Without directly regarding him, the two stand, drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave. 
LARDNER Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man? 
MCCULLERS In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn. 
Lardner can neither confirm nor deny this. 
LARDNER You always say that. You always have to know everybody. Why don't I just take the weekend off and let you kill him. Since you two are so close. 
They exit. 
EXT. EXIT RAMP, DETROIT AIRPORT - MORNING 
INSIDE MARTIN'S CAR 
Martin, in a black Lincoln Town Car, veers off of the airport artery and on to a turnpike. The radio broadcasts the news. 
BROADCAST (V.O.) ...with highs today in the upper seventies. Related stocks on Wall Street today as scandal continues to rock the joint U.S.-Japanese Tech Center... 
MARTIN'S CAR 
blows past CAMERA and on down the road. After a beat, a mid- eighties Ford Country Squire station wagon follows, occupied by two figures. 
INSIDE THE COUNTRY SQUIRE 
are Lardner and McCullers. They listen to the same broadcast. 
BROADCAST (V.O.) ...An unknown "whistle-blower" has leaked a number of critical flaws in the safety designs of next year's models to authorities that could cost millions in recalls.... 
MARTIN 
flips through the dial, pausing on Rush Limbaugh who waxes fascistically. 
MARTIN Mein hero. 
...and then turns the dial again and cuts in on "Armageddon Time," slow reggae vibe by The Clash. 
EXT. HIGHWAY- 
Martin drives down the roadway... headlong into his past. Dig it... 
INT. MARTIN'S CAR 
Martin turns up the volume as he reacts to a familiar voice.... 
Martin looks left of the store, then right, behind him, then back at the store. Bewildered, he gets out of the car. 
WIDE SHOT 
of Martin as he walks with purpose. He halts in the middle of the lot. He puts his hands on his hips, stares, then moves in... We stay wide as he enters the store and addresses the clerk inside. 
MARTIN What are you doing here? 
CARL, the store clerk tries to get a grip on this question. 
CARL A double shift. What's it look like? (softening) Can I help you with something? 
Martin's head pans the room, processing. 
MARTIN I don't think so. 
EXT. 7-11 PAYPHONE - MORNING 
Martin continues to gaze at the structure as if it's a lunar landscape. 
MARTIN (into phone) Dr. Oatman. Dr. Oatman. Please pick up if you're there... It's Martin Blank. It's gone. My house. It's not here. My house is gone and now there's a 7-11 here... And that's unfortunate... You can never go home again, Dr. Oatman. 
Martin hangs up. He watches one-stop shoppers come and go. 
MARTIN (to himself) But I guess you can shop there. 
INT. NURSING HOME - DAY 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. 
of a NURSE leading him down a drab, antiseptic hallway. She banks into the sunlit room where a wispy woman in her late fifties sits expectantly on the edge of the bed clutching her purse in one hand, a filterless Pall-Mall in the other, a light coat on. This is MARY BLANK. She suffers from Alzheimer's or something just as debilitating. 
NURSE Mary, your son's here. 
The nurse gently eases Mary up. Martin hugs Mary stiffly and pats her shoulders. Mary takes hold of Martin's arm. They start out of the room. 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 
They walk past a school-yard park fitted with a set of swings, baseball diamonds, and a small grove of trees. She smokes and hacks. 
MARY I bought a new rug. 
MARTIN That's wonderful, Mom. 
MARY What's a revival tent? 
MARTIN It's a place where religious people-- 
MARY (knowingly) Marlin Perkins and Jim! 
MARTIN Jim? 
MARY His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass! 
Mary coughs horribly. 
MARTIN It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing. 
MARY I spoke to your father the other day. 
MARTIN I imagine that'd be rather difficult. 
MARY Nature made him then broke the mold. 
Martin decides to change the subject. 
MARTIN They told me you're taking lithium, mom. 
MARY Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache. 
MARTIN You have a headache? 
LARDNER AND MCCULLERS P.O.V. 
of Martin pulling into a space on the street outside the radio station. He gets out, looking nervous. 
INT. RADIO STATION - DAY 
Debi flips on the "ON-AIR" switch and prepares to speak into the microphone. Martin walks in. Debi sees him. They stare at each other. The song ends. Dead air. After a moment... 
DEBI (on air, groping) WRFN playing all vinyl, all the time. Oldies from the eighties. That was ah... the Specials. Doing... one of their songs... 
Debi turns to turntable B and finds it empty. She turns back to turntable A and lets the record roll on. 
DEBI ...and here's another. 
Debi swivels around to face Martin. 
MARTIN "Oldies from the eighties?" 
After a long pause.... 
DEBI I just play my own collection. 
MARTIN It's nice to see you again. 
Debi says nothing, just stares at him, in shock. 
MARTIN How long has it been? 
DEBI Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word? 
MARTIN Ten years, I think. What I miss? 
Debi slowly grooves into irony, her best defense. 
DEBI Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months. 
MARTIN Here is now there. There is here. 
Their eyes lock on each other... 
DEBI Those are the headlines. 
The request line buzzes. 
DEBI Hold that thought. (into phone) WRFN FM, Grosse Pointe. All vinyl, all the... (pauses) No Pearl Jam. Call back in ten years. 
Beat. Debi makes the move. 
DEBI Tell me about yourself. 
MARTIN I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really. 
DEBI That's it? 
MARTIN Not much else. 
DEBI What's your business? 
MARTIN I'm a professional killer. 
DEBI Professional killer. Do you get dental with that? 
Beat. 
MARTIN Well, I'm in town for a few days, anyway. 
They run out of words, the moment too big for small talk. Martin gets the fear, breaks it off. 
MARTIN Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back. 
DEBI Okay. 
MARTIN I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 
DEBI --Torn down in the name of convenience-- 
MARTIN --and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really. 
DEBI Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty? 
MARTIN You see someone? 
DEBI Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being? 
Martin says nothing. 
DEBI All right then. Would you like to share any more deeply personal thoughts with our listening audience before we go to our phone poll and see how the folks in radioland come down on this one? 
A beat as Martin realizes he's been had. He seems about to bolt. 
DEBI Should a broken-hearted girl give a guy a second chance at love.... 
Debi jabs a phone line on the console. 
DEBI (HARD) You're on the air. 
Martin deflates. 
OLD WOMAN'S VOICE I think this young man has avoided the question completely. Has not discussed "what happened" nor if he's sorry for what he has done. Therefore, I don't see any reason why you should see him until he fully discloses his intentions and feelings. 
DEBI Thank you caller. 
Stabs another line. 
DEBI You're on the air. 
DUMB GUY VOICE Are you there? 
DEBI Yes. 
DUMB GUY VOICE No, the guy. 
Martin looks up, humiliated. 
MARTIN Yeah.... 
DUMB GUY VOICE Uh... when you guys use to go out... Did you guys ever... heh heh heh heh... ever fuckin', ever totally fuckin' heh heh heh- 
DEBI Next caller. 
GUFF MAN VOICE I don't know, Debi. Sounds like bad gas to me. I would not allow him access to your being. 
DEBI Thank you. 
DEBI Grosse Pointe Michigan, I hear you loud and clear: "If you love something set it free. If it comes back to you it's, well... 
She turns to him and shrugs apologetically. 
DEBI ...Broken...." 
Martin has his answer. 
EXT. RADIO STATION - DAY 
Martin leaves the station, alone and beaten down. 
MARTIN Dammit. Never trust my instincts. 
He scans the main strip. 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. 
A MAN walks down the street. He is FELIX, a bookish, forgettable man in his forties, wearing Le Coq Sportif sweats and shoes. He looks as if he has a dark cloud over his head. Martin's seen him somewhere, and doesn't like what he remembers. Martin's POV TRACKS him. 
SOUTHTEC GUARD Well, a 'course, taxes provide your basic service-- police and whatnot. But our customers need a little more than just that, you understand? This badge doesn't mean that I am a peace officer. 
The woman turns at Martin and smiles. Martin smiles back. 
MARTIN So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me. 
SOUTHTEC GUARD To shoot you. Correct. 
MARTIN How did you get this job? 
SOUTHTEC GUARD Well, they were hiring, and it was only a two week course... 
MARTIN (pleasantly) Wow. 
Paul walks the happy couple down the steps. 
PAUL (to couple) ...What more can I say. 
HUSBAND (smiling) We'll talk soon. 
PAUL (much hand gesturing) You'll be raising your new family in a work of art. A work of art in a work of art. 
Paul looks at Martin and the Guard, inviting them into the sell. 
SOUTHTEC GUARD I'm sure you'll be very happy. 
All look to Martin.... 
MARTIN (heartfelt) When my time comes, if it ever does, I want a beautiful, normal place like this... and a wife like you... 
All are confused. Martin thumbs to the guard. 
MARTIN ...and you'll be safe here... 
Paul looks at his shoes and rolls his shoulders. 
EXT. FRANK LLOYD WRIGHT HOUSE 
Lardner and McCullers sit in the wagon, watching the house in the distance. 
INT. PAUL'S BMW - LATER 
Martin and Paul cut through a particularly charming neighborhood. 
PAUL Now. I don't make a habit of pimping my friends, but there is one prime little piece of land that you must see... 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. 
A sprawling gingerbread mansion rises into view. A long and winding driveway cuts through thickly wooded property to the house. 
MARTIN (V.O.) Debi's house. 
PAUL (V.O.) Kind of crept up on you, didn't it? 
C.U. OF MARTIN 
MARTIN No. You drove us here. 
PAUL Yeah, but it's still kind of eerie, isn't it? 
MARTIN No. 
Martin's not listening. His eyes track the house out the window. 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. 
of the mansion. 
They roll slowly by Debi's house. 
They drive in silence for a beat. Paul suddenly swerves to the shoulder, jams the brake, and turns on Martin. 
FELIX 
Comes through the door, drawing a Mac-10 for each hand. 
MARTIN 
grabs the gum out of his mouth and sticks it onto the bottom of the Glock .9mm he has produced from somewhere in his suit. 
CARL 
grabs the cash drawer, sets it on the counter, and puts his hands up. 
THE SKATEBOARDER 
Plays on. 
FELIX AND CARL 
Felix shoots CARL DEAD on his way toward 
MARTIN 
Bolts up the cooler aisle. Bursts of FIRE follow him, taking out each freezer door behind him. 
MARTIN AND FELIX 
EXCHANGE FIRE John Woo-style between the aisles of the cramped store. Felix delivers a close-to-home burst as he jumps the counter, sending Martin diving out of view. 
MARTIN 
pinned behind the Slurpee machine, pauses to reload his now two Glock nines. Martin steals a glance to get a bead on Felix and is met with a salvo that rocks the Slurpee machine, spattering him with several flavors... and that's all he can take. Martin comes up BLASTING with both guns, but all that's left of Felix is swinging doors and squealing tires. 
Martin moves to the cashier island, low to the ground. 
THE SKATEBOARDER 
Twitches and jerks, still absorbed in his game and oblivious to the surrounding carnage. 
CASHIER ISLAND 
Martin crawls through the waist-level swinging door and moves to Carl. 
CARL 
is really dead. Martin rolls him over to check it out and finds 
A BOMB 
under the corpse. 
MARTIN 
Flips the corpse back on top of the device and leaps the counter toward the doors. He grabs the shoulder or the Skateboarder, who shrugs him off, annoyed-- 
SKATEBOARDER What the fuck, man?! 
The video game screen explodes. Shot full of Martin's bullets. The Skateboarder reacts backward and Martin jerks him out of the double doors. 
EXT. 7-11 - CONTINUOUS 
The Skateboarder is running like crazy, and Martin's car is peeling out in reverse as the 7-11 is blown to hell. 
INT. MARTIN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 
Martin's hair is matted with Slurpee as he tries to drive and cool out. He sees his do in the mirror, pulls out a comb and starts to comb it back into a slick Pat Riley style. 
EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT 
Martin walks in, not looking half bad, considering. Debi looks up from some reading. "Naïve Melody" by the Talking Heads plays in the studio. 
MARTIN Are you going to the reunion? 
Grocer looks a little hurt. 
MARTIN (easing up) Look, this is a one-on-one business... Every time you get to know people, bad things happen. If it'll make you feel any better, this is my last job. So what do you say we put our guns away and forget the whole damn thing. 
Grocer loses it. 
GROCER Fuck you! No scabs! From now on, everything's regulated! 
Long beat as Grocer gets a hold of himself. 
MARTIN No deal. 
GROCER Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job... 
MARTIN (Wry) Is that right? 
GROCER Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole. 
MARTIN Nice talk, Sugarmouth. 
INT. SUITE - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Martin sits at a desk, staring at the reunion card. He tosses it aside, gets up, and moves in front of a mirror. He wears a crisp black suit and practices his greeting smile... 
MARTIN (trying on smile) Yes, I'm a pet psychiatrist. I sell couch insurance. I test-market positive thinking. I lead a weekend men's group, actually. We specialize in ritual killings. I'm hungry, are you hungry, I'm hungry, oooh, ooh. (sarcastic) Hi, I'm Martin Blank, remember me? I'm not married, I have no kids and I'd blow your brains out if someone paid me enough... So how've you been? Where do you stand on The Issues? Are you Left? Right? Up, down, proud, shamed, blahblahblahblah-- 
EXT. DEBI'S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING 
Martin makes his way up the walk leading to the front door, holding a simple bouquet of flowers. He skips up the front steps and finds the doorbell. After a moment, Debi answers. 
DEBI Flowers. That's funny. 
MARTIN As long as I get the laugh. 
DEBI (taking them) Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol. 
She backs into the house, and he follows. 
INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
Martin follows Debi into the hall. Both are enjoying this atavistic ritual. 
MARTIN You look beautiful. 
DEBI Okay... Hold on... 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. 
through a doorway leading into a den. All that's visible of MR. NEWBERRY, Debi's father, is a pair of legs resting in a Barcolounger. 
DEBI (V.O.) ...Let me get my coat. 
MARTIN I'll just help myself to a cocktail. 
DEBI 
moves up the stairs and disappears. 
MARTIN 
looks at the legs, rolls his shoulders, and heads into the den. 
INT. DEN - CONTINUOUS 
Mr. Newberry sits in the recliner reading a Tom Clancy novel. He is a corporate Aspen-dude-ranch sort with a good head of hair. He sighs, closes the book on his knee and looks up to Martin. 
MARTIN Good evening, Mr. Newberry. 
MR. NEWBERRY Good evening, Mr. Blank. 
MARTIN How are you? How's business? 
MARTIN (remembering) Drafting. 
TERRY Yeah, I couldn't stand that fucking class. But I appreciate you helping me out, man. 
MARTIN Don't mention it. 
TERRY Yeah, thanks. Well I'm going to try and get out of here, man. I'll see you later. 
Terry slinks off. 
BAR - SAME 
Bob Destephano grabs two more scotches off the bar and turns to leave, thoroughly morose. In his path, he finds DAN KORETZKY, the good-looking side of brainy. 
DAN Bob. Bob Destephano. 
BOB What? 
DAN I'm Dan. Dan Koretzky. 
BOB Computer guy. 
DAN Yeah... Hey, I saw you at your dad's dealership the other day. 
BOB I sell BMW's. What do you do? 
DAN Not much, actually. My software company just went public so I'm just... hanging out, really. 
There's a sudden lull in the conversation. Bob tries his drunken hand at relating... 
BOB Remember high school? 
DAN Sure. Listen. Why don't you join us up in the grandstands? 
Dan points up to a group of happy, laughing people. Bob walks off shaking his head and smiling bitterly. 
INT. GYM - LATER 
Debi and Martin are seated at a round table with six others in an area blocked off for dinner. Plates of gumbo are arriving and the wine is poured. DARIUS, an African-American, is in mid-conversation with AMY, who looks like she walked out of a Laura Ashley catalog and sits on the other side of Martin. DENNIS and MIKE are two suits in the midst of a non- stop sports conversation. 
MIKE ...You gotta hold the fans responsible, though, Dennis, because they're the ones putting up with the mediocre product. 
DENNIS I guess, though, you know, if you look at it Mike, that park is a beautiful park, I've gone to that park many times - I've had the greatest time of my life at that ballpark and let's face it, I tell you this, Mike, by the sixth inning, if you're having the fun you should be having at Tigers Stadium, you don't even know what the hell's going on anyway... 
They both crack up at this. 
ANGLE ON DARIUS, MARTIN, & DEBI 
DARIUS Have you two been together since high school? 
DEBI No-- 
MARTIN --Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna-- 
DEBI We haven't seen each other since high school. 
DARIUS I figured. You two look too happy together. I shouldn't say that though, I'm married... So, Martin-- what are you up to these days? What do you do for a living? 
Debi perks up; this should be interesting. 
MARTIN I'm in pro-active international relations. It's a very specialized company. We execute economic investment opportunities. Sort of economic clean-up... with an emphasis on personnel. It's boring, you know, it's boring. I don't like to talk about it because I don't think what a man does necessarily reflects who he is... 
Martin begins to draw strange looks from all over the table. Martin may be in trouble. 
MARTIN ...I've always tried to refrain from a black-and-white moral lexicon--you know, good, bad, right, wrong--I've been more interested in the gray areas. 
Silence. Martin pushes on. 
MARTIN But that's no way to live. I guess you've got to just take the leap of faith. Believe in something. Fuck it. 
DARIUS Sounds complicated, Martin. Are you happy? 
Martin looks out over the milieu below, enjoying the seene. He eavesdrops on a group of men from a few rows back. 
GROUP OF MEN 
DAN Look at her. There it is. Jenny Slater. The finest thing that ever walked these halls. 
FORMER-SQUARE #2 I believe she married the state of Maine. 
DAN Yeah, he's around here somewhere. What a shame. She would have looked great in my fucking Bentley. 
FORMER-SQUARE #3 No, my friends, Jenny Beam. Not only was she as fine, if not finer, than Slater, but she had the "bad girl" thing going for her. And the red hair. C'mon. 
DAN She's a paramedic in Skokie, Illinois. 
FORMER-SQUARE #2 You both are mistaken. Jenny Maretti was the finest. No question about it. 
FORMER-SQUARE #3 The three Jenny's. Three Jenny's. All named Jenny... 
DAN You know what I'm really hoping? That Jenny Slater gets divorced. And she's twenty-eight-- 
FORMER-SQUARE #3 --she's got half the state of Maine-- 
DAN She's twenty-eight years old, with two kids, she's still really really fine, and I see her at a bookstore or something, and she sees me for what I was then, and what I am now: the redemption for all her failure. 
FORMER-SQUARE #3 You mean the redemption for all your failure. 
They ponder this. Martin looks down on the gym, concentrating on Debi. 
BOB DESTEPHANO 
Dancing drunkenly, miserable, like an unbalanced orangutan. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GYM - DEEJAY BOOTH - LATER 
Martin stands by Debi as she sits in for a set in the deejay booth, on a raised stage. They are playing an old sophomoric game. 
DEBI Which would you rather...? 
MARTIN Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week? 
DEBI Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller-- 
MARTIN --She's not dead--- 
DEBI It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth? 
MARTIN Wow. I have to give this some thought. 
DEBI No time. 
MARTIN Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller. 
STACEY breaks the moment, looking up at the two, horrified and unsure at what she's heard. 
STACEY Marty! Debi! How are you! So many people came, but I never expected to see you Marty. Or you Debi... I mean... because of what your divorce... I didn't mean to say that. I just meant you look so good. 
DEBI Thank you. 
STACEY Do you think you could play "Too Shy'" by Kaja Goo Goo? 
DEBI Stacey, why don't you come up here and take over for a little while? 
STACEY I'd love to. 
Stacey nods thanks and makes her way up into the booth as Martin and Debi make their way down. 
DEBI (to Martin) Everybody thinks they know me now that I'm divorced. 
She leads Martin toward the exit. 
Bob crumbles. 
BOB Ahhh... it's all fucked up. Nothing adds up to nothing... you work your whole life, day in and day out-- try to make sense of it all. One day you're twenty-seven and what do you get to show for it... 
MARTIN You could've been a contender, huh? 
Bob realizes he can't even express his own tragedy without the use of cliches. 
BOB Smart boy. Real smart. Let's see how smart you are with my foot up your ass! I'm gonna kick your ass! 
Martin steps to Bob. 
MARTIN Why would you want to hit me, Bob? Do you really believe that there's some stored up conflict that needs resolution between us? We don't exist. There's nothing between us. So who do you want to hit, Bob? It's not me. 
Bob slumps against the lockers, deflated. 
BOB What am I gonna do? 
MARTIN What do you want to do? 
BOB I want to be an actor. 
MARTIN Then express yourself, Bob. 
Bob frowns, trying to think of a way to express himself. 
MARTIN (catching him) Be honest... 
Bob backs up and lets out a huge, drunken caveman scream, then stops abruptly, and smiles. 
BOB Later, Martin. 
Bob backpedals down the hallway and out of sight. Martin watches him stumble out of the hallway and bang through the doors of a stairwell, disappearing. 
INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS 
Bob slams through the doors and begins to stumble down the stairs. He encounters Debi, on her way up. He glances at her but does not break stride. Debi gives him wide berth, and quickens her pace up the stairs... 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Martin watches the doors swing to a stop. He exhales and relaxes... AND THEN Spin-pivots on his right heel, as a BURST from a silenced pistol pierces the space where his head was a split-second before/ As he spins around, his right hand withdraws Ken's give-away pen from his kerchief pocket, pops the cap off, and drive the pen up and through the throat of his attacker-- 
FELIX 
impaled through the throat on the pen, his head snapped back. 
MARTIN AND FELIX 
are frozen for a moment. Blood runs quickly down the front of Felix's body, off of his shoes, and on to the floor. The stairwell doors band open. Martin's head turns toward the sound. His eyes lock onto 
DEBI 
who is frozen, horrified for a moment. She flees. 
MARTIN 
looks back at 
FELIX 
Dead. 
THE FLOOR 
A growing pool of blood. 
MARTIN 
Looks around wildly, holding Felix up against the lockers. Above the lockers is a plastic banner proclaiming 
"SPANISH CLUB FIESTA FUN-RAISER SATURDAY JUNE 1" 
MARTIN Don't worry. I left you a little something under your desk. 
Martin hangs up. 
Marcella goes to it and pulls loose from underneath a shrink- wrapped brick of $100 bills, probably a $100,000 or so. 
MARCELLA All right!! 
INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR 
Martin makes his way down the road to the Newberry's. In the distance, he sees a lone figure jogging on the shoulder, away from him. 
INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME 
Grocer and Company are parked off to the side, watching Newberry, in the distance, jog toward them. A SNIPER prepares to blow Newberry's head off. 
INT. MARTIN'S TOWN CAR - SAME 
As he approaches the figure, he recognizes it as Newberry, he accelerates. 
INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME 
Grocer spots Martin's car speeding at Newberry. 
GROCER Oh shit... 
EXT. ROAD - SAME 
Newberry stops jogging and turns to face the Town Car bearing down on him. His face goes slack, expecting to be creamed. 
INT. TOWN CAR - SAME 
Martin roars straight at Newberry, his engine shrieking. As the distance between them turns from yards to feet... Martin swerves hard, just missing Newberry and comes to a halt next to him, blocking the Sniper's line of fire. After a moment, Newberry opens the passenger door. 
NEWBERRY What the fuck is the matter with you?! 
MARTIN Well, I was hired to kill you. It's what I do, and come to think of it, I told you that, but... Okay. I'm not going to do it. Get in the car. 
He does. They drive on. 
MARTIN It's either because I'm in love with your daughter, or because I have a new-found respect for life. Or both. But I don't know. 
INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME 
Grocer and company watch in amazement. 
GROCER'S P.O.V. 
of Martin's car disappearing into Newberry's long and wooded driveway. 
GROCER That punk is either in love with that guy's daughter or he has new found respect for life... Let's go. 
EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME 
Martin pulls up in front and stops. Both men scramble out and head toward the front door at a quick clip. Newberry is shaken; Martin seems at ease, at home in his element. 
NEWBERRY Why? I build cars! They're paying you to kill me? Why? 
MARTIN It was a cost-cutting effort. They can't afford a recall. 
NEWBERRY It was a leaky sunroof! A design flaw! I reported a leaky sunroof! You want to kill me because of that? 
MARTIN It's not me! Why does everybody think it's personal?! 
They go through the front door and shut it behind them. 
INT. GROCER'S VAN - SAME 
Grocer drops the van into gear and heads toward the driveway. 
INT. COUNTRY SQUIRE - SAME 
MARTIN I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving. 
GROCER (O.S.) Don't listen to him, he's a professional. 
Martin stops short and cocks his head toward Grocer's muffled voice coming from the vent. Grocer continues... 
GROCER (O.S.) You're breaking my heart down here, Blank. I can't shoot through the tears. 
Martin, incensed, bends down and takes the gun from the dead man. He runs out of the bedroom, gun poised for a kamikaze firefight... 
EXT. NEWBERRY HOUSE - SAME 
Lardner and McCullers are poised outside the front door, about to enter the mix. McCullers peers through the window. 
LARDNER Did you see Blank in there? 
MCCULLERS No... 
LARDNER Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble. 
INT. NEWBERRY FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
MARTIN 
reaches the top of the front stairs to find Grocer heading up the stairs at him. They lift their guns at each other to FIRE, when they hear... 
LARDNER AND MCCULLERS 
power through the front door, guns BLAZING at floor-level, ala Butch and Sundance. 
Martin and Grocer, above, spin on them instinctively, and FIRE, killing them. Grocer dives off of the stairs and rolls out of view. 
KITCHEN - INTERCUT 
GROCER 
heads up the back stairs. 
MARTIN 
works his way toward Grocer, moving with stealth toward the kitchen. 
GROCER 
hears him and starts back down. 
Martin dives behind the cooking island just as Grocer comes out of the stairwell blasting. They unload at each other as Grocer runs a pattern across the kitchen, FIRING at Martin, crouched, who BLASTS back. Grocer vaults himself through the air toward a serving window from the kitchen to the dining room, still firing. 
C.U. - MARTIN'S GUN - SLOW MOTION 
The last casing floats out of the chamber into the air, and the slide on the auto locks back-- empty. 
NORMAL SPEED 
GROCER 
Flying through the air disappearing through the shuttered serving window, his flight carrying him past a television that sits on a lazy susan. 
MARTIN AND GROCER - INTERCUT 
Martin and Grocer sit on the floor, backs up against opposite side of the counter-- Martin in the kitchen and Grocer in the dining room. The hulking old television sits on the counter above and between them. 
Martin looks up and spies the TELEVISION 
GROCER ...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece? 
MARTIN Okay. 
Martin takes out a checkbook, and tears one free. He wads it into a loose ball and tosses it over the counter. 
BALLED CHECK

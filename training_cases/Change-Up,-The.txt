MITCH (CONT'D) You look hot by the way, Jame. Jamie laughs but clearly doesn't mind the flirtation. 
JAMIE Thanks... sort of...? 
MITCH No really. I never would've guessed twins. 
JAMIE Annnd that's probably enough-- 
MITCH Is Dave still meeting your needs sexually? Jamie just laughs, shaking her head, unbelievable. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Oh, did I tell you I ran into Miss Hickam last week at Starbucks? 
JAMIE Our old kindergarten teacher?! 
MITCH Yeah. She always liked Dave better than me... 
JAMIE Honey, everyone likes Dave better than you. 
MITCH Fair enough. Anyway, I tried to get her number, but she goes "I don't date former students," so I go, "great, do you fuck former students?" and then she calls me a "potty-mouth degenerate" and runs out without her coffee. So I got a free venti macchiato, which is cool- 
DAVE (O.S.) Bathed, changed and in their Pis. Mitch turns to see Dave in khakis and a buttondown, entering the kitchen with the freshly bathed twins. Mitch grins: 
MITCH Awww! Come to Uncle Mitch... Dave hands the twins to Mitch, and they COO, impishly cute. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Oh my God, they smell like heaven had sex with a dryer sheet. (loudly to babies) 
HI! WHAT'S YOUR NAME?! WHICH ONE 
ARE YOU?! (they just GURGLE) Why can't they talk yet? Are they retarded or something? 
JAMIE 
(LAUGHING) What?! No! They're fine! 
MITCH Really? The one on the left looks a little downsy. 
(JAMIE GASPS) Kidding! Kidding. (aside, to Dave) A little bit though, right? Ignoring him, Dave fastens the twins into their Bouncy Seats. 
DAVE I'll be back right after the game, okay, Pumpkin? 
JAMIE Whenever. Have fun. 
MITCH See you, Jame! 
JAMIE Always a pleasure, Mitch. Mitch steals THREE PEARS and some TULIPS as he exits... 
CUT TO: 
TWO BEERS POPPING OPEN on the bottle cap-opener mounted on Mitch's dashboard... 
INT. MITCH'S CAR -- EVENING 
Mitch offers Dave one of (his own) beers as they speed along in his Fiero. Dave is reluctant. 
DAVE Yeah, I'm good. 
MITCH Really? You're going to make me drink alone? 
DAVE Yeah, well, you're driving, so... Mitch shrugs and slides the spare beer into his chest pocket. 
MITCH Oh, dude: great news. 
DAVE You found another futon? 
MITCH That's awesome, because I'm made of emotional Teflon and words can't hurt me anymore. No: I auditioned for a major movie role yesterday. 
DAVE Nice. What movie? 
MITCH It's called Busted Dreams 4. It's about a renegade coroner who reads minds named Jake Action. It's like a sexy Mentalist. 
DAVE Sounds cool. 
MITCH Yeah, I read for the part of Steve Action, Jake's troubled younger brother with a secret, and I fucking killed it. I cried like five times during the audition and it's a fucking action movie. Plus I'm the spitting image of the dude who plays Jake Action, so... 
MITCH Who's number two? Fergie--? 
DAVE Just finish your story, man! I'm dying over here! 
MITCH Fine. So Tatiana's packing double E's, which means like 20 plus pounds of breastmeat -- yeah, it's almost too much for one man to handle. Thank God I'm the son of a butcher and have strong hands and wrists. Anyway, she walks in wearing this tight black dress, and you know what she says to me? Dave shakes his head, on the edge of his bar stool. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Nothing. Because all Tatiana wants to do at 3 in the morning is fucky fucky rubber ducky! Dave drunkenly slaps him ten, barely making hand-contact. 
MITCH (CONT'D) And look, I'm not one to kiss and tell... (downing another shot) but this chick is insatiable. She wants it in every position: Missionary, wheelbarrow, Reverse Wheelbarrow, Assassin-- 
DAVE I don't even know what those are! 
MITCH No one does! It gets so intense that my nose starts bleeding. Yeah, so I'm bleeding all over this chick and she's fucking digging it. 
(MORE) 
MITCH (CONT'D) It's like some weird Dracula Anne Rice shit, and I'm fading in and out of consciousness, and then, when it's all over, she turns to me and goes: "Tuesday night I'm coming back and we're really going to fuck." Dave just stares at him, glassy-eyed, drunk, emotional. 
DAVE That is maybe the single greatest story I've ever heard in my life. 
MITCH Ah, it's not always like that... 
DAVE I don't know why...I don't know why I've always been in such a rush, you know? 
MITCH 
WHAT 
(BURRRRP) do you mean? 
DAVE You remember me in high school, I was always so focussed on getting into a good college, then when I got to college, I was so focussed on getting into a good law school, then in law school I was just trying to land a job at a good firm, then Jamie and I got married and we had Cara right away-- I just feel like and I missed out on all the fun stuff, you know? The sex, the drugs, the bad choices, and now it's too late. I blew it. I pissed away my 20's, and now I'm staring down the barrel a seriously boring life. 
MITCH Oh come on, Jamie is hot! 
DAVE No, I know-- 
MITCH I really want to have sex with her! 
DAVE Wait, what? 
MITCH And your kids are adorable! They're like fun little puppies that talk! The bill comes. Dave pulls out a wad of cash, throws it on the table, and stumbles for the door. Mitch lifts one of Dave's twenties off the table and follows him out... 
EXT. SPORTSBAR -- CONTINUOUS 
They stumble down the dark Hollywood street together... 
DAVE Don't get me wrong, I love my kids, I do, I would take a bullet for them, but...remember that heroin addict you dated? 
MITCH Tara? Or Rena? Or Rachel? 
DAVE Jesus, how many heroin addicts have you dated? 
MITCH It's a national scourge, dude. 
DAVE Anyway. Having kids is like dating a heroin addict, only instead of dating them, they move into your house for 18 years. They're laughing one second and crying the next and then they're trying to kill themselves in your bathroom for no reason. They're mean and selfish and they burn through all your money and they steal your shit and they break everything and they stay up all night and they listen to really shitty music and the dirty secret is, no one actually likes kids. 
MITCH Oh come on, you don't mean that-- 
DAVE No! It's true. Everyone pretends to like kids because if you don't you look like a huge dick. It's like Drew Barrymore or jazz. No one actually likes them, but if you say that out loud, everybody hates you. 
MITCH Dude, I love Drew Barrymore -- have you seen Boys on the Side? They weave across a LARGE PLAZA, stumbling for Mitch's car. 
DAVE I'm just saying: don't fuck up your life like I did, okay? 
MITCH What are you talking about? You've got it all! You've got a huge house full of food and furniture -- shit, your TV is bigger than my car! You have a great job, you make a shit- ton of money, and people respect you, man! My last job involved an ape costume -- do you know what that does to a man? Dave waves him off, not really hearing him. But Mitch is sincere, heartfelt: 
MITCH (CONT'D) Plus you've got a hot, extremely fuckable wife who cooks and cleans and takes care of all your needs! It's like having a really hot mom who you can also have sex with! 
DAVE Wait, what--? 
MITCH Also you're never lonely, you always have someone to talk to about your day, plus you get to do all the fun gay couple stuff like go to wine country! You think single guys can go to wine country?! No way! They won't even let us in! You're living the dream, dude! What more do you want?! 
DAVE Tatiana! I want Tatiana! I want sex with strange new women and maybe also with Sabrina if she's single and I want to wake up at noon and smoke weed all afternoon and I want to not think about the needs of four other people 24 hours a day and I want to start reading a novel and actually finish it and I want to take a solid shit because I'm not constantly stressed out and I want to learn how to rollerblade and also I really want to pee... 
JAMIE Um, yeah? 
MITCH Did we...?! Panicked, he thrusts his fist like, have sex?! 
JAMIE Are you insane? 
MITCH So why the hell did I wake up in your bed?! 
JAMIE Are you still drunk? 
MITCH Look, just, where's Dave?! 
JAMIE What? 
MITCH Where's fucking Dave?! 
JAMIE Dave is right here! You're Dave! He turns and sees himself in the mirror. Freezes. He is Dave. 
MITCH Oh my God... Oh my God... He slowly touches his new face... 
MITCH (CONT'D) I'm a fucking tool. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- MORNING 
A body lies sprawled on Mitch's futon, out cold. INSANE POUNDING on the door shatters the silence. 
MITCH (O.S.) 
OPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR IMMEDIATELY! The body sits up, groggy and confused -- it is, of course, Dave in Mitch's body. While he looks like Mitch, he moves, talks, and even shuffles to the door exactly like Dave... 
DAVE Mitch...? 
MITCH (O.S.) Fucking open the fucking door! Dave stops, noticing that he's in Mitch's empty apartment. 
DAVE Why am I in your sad apartment-- 
MITCH (O.S.) The door, dude! Open the door! 
DAVE Fine, Jesus, relax-- Dave opens the door to see himself standing there. 
DAVE (CONT'D) What the fuck is this...? Dave backpedals, terrified, as Mitch blows inside, furious. 
MITCH I knew it! 
DAVE 
(FREAKING OUT) Who the hell are you?! And why do you look like me?! Mitch angles Dave over to the mirror on the otherwise barren wall-and Dave sees he's in Mitch's body... Stunned, he slowly touches his new face... his new hair. . .his new body... 
DAVE (CONT'D) Oh my God... 
MITCH I know, dude. 
DAVE I'm a fucking loser... 
MITCH Wait, what? Dave spins, completely awake now: 
DAVE How the fuck did this happen?! 
MITCH How should I know?! Has this ever happened to you before?! 
DAVE What, switching bodies with another human being?! Oh yeah, this shit happens to me like twice a week! 
MITCH Well...I don't want to be you! 
DAVE Oh, you don't want to be me?! No, no, no: I don't want to be you! 
MITCH What's that supposed to mean?! 
DAVE Look, let's just.. .think. How could this have possibly happened...? They pace about the apartment, trying to think... Then: 
MITCH Bingo. Got it. We're dreaming. Dave grabs Mitch's nipple and twists it hard. 
DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON (beat, deadpan) It's not in the computer. Mitch LUNGES for Carla, but Dave grabs him and wrestles him out of the office. 
MITCH 
YOU ARE EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG 
WITH THE WORLD--! 
DAVE We'll call you tomorrow! Thank you! 
EXT. DEPARTMENT OF PARKS BUILDING -- DAY 
Dave and Mitch exit the Department of Parks building and pace on the sunny sidewalk, their hands on their heads, stunned. 
MITCH This is so fucked... 
DAVE We should just go home and lock the 
DOORS AND-- Mitch's phone rings in Dave's pocket. Dave hesitates, then answers it, fruitlessly trying to sound like Mitch: 
DAVE (CONT'D) This is fucking Mitch? 
MITCH I don't talk like that, dude-- 
DAVE Okay ...Okay...Great...Thank you. 
Dave clicks off. 
MITCH Who was that? 
DAVE Marty Green, the producer of Busted Dreams 4. Apparently the guy they cast for Steve Action OD'd last night, and the back-up actor got deported, so, alphabetically, you're the next actor on the list. You got the part, man. Mitch covers his mouth like he just won American Idol. 
MITCH Oh my God! Oh my God! Dreams really do come true--! 
(REALIZING) Wait, no, this sucks! I'm stuck in your fat dad-body! I can't play Steve Action looking like this! 
DAVE (remembering, stunned) Oh my God: and I've got my closing today. 
MITCH What, is that like a big deal? 
DAVE A big--?! Yeah! Whether or not I make partner is riding on this! 
MITCH So what the hell are we gonna do? PANICKED SILENCE. Then Mitch looks at Dave... 
DAVE No. No. We can't just be each other for a day, Mitch! You have no idea how to be a lawyer! 
MITCH Dude, I'm an actor, a human chameleon, I can do lawyer in my fucking sleep! It's you I'm worried about: you can't act for shit! 
DAVE First of all, it's Busted Dreams 4, okay? It's not The Reader. Second of all, I'm a WASP, I've spent my entire life acting happy and no one has ever questioned my performance, okay?! They look at each other, cooling off a bit... 
DAVE (CONT'D) Are...Are we actually considering doing this...? 
MITCH I mean, we have to...right? Both men look highly anxious. Dave glances at the time. 
DAVE All right, well, my meeting starts in 45 minutes. You need to race home, get dressed, then go to my office and find my secretary Gladys- 
MITCH She sounds hot, is she hot? 
DAVE No. Get the merger docs from Gladys and take them to the conference room. All the partners will be there so do not speak to anyone. 
MITCH Really? Because I can vamp-- 
DAVE NO! No vamping! And once the meeting starts, you will continue to say nothing. When a partner asks you for the merger documents, you will silently hand them over, okay? 
MITCH Dude, I get it. Play it big, but maintain my reality-- 
DAVE No! Play it small. Really small. I've spent the last nine months banging out the terms of this deal, all you have to do is hand over the documents. That's it. 
MITCH Dude, that's easy as fuck. Okay, for me, go home, put on some cool clothes, and get to set -- all the info is on my phone. Once you're there, go to Hair & Makeup and memorize your lines and try not to be a total douche to everyone, okay? This is the film industry. Everyone is really cool. They look at each other, very doubtful that this will work... 
MITCH (CONT'D) I'm trusting you, dude... 
DAVE I'm trusting you, too... 
CEO TED NORTON Spare me, Ken, you were just trying to inflate your share price! 
CEO KEN KINKABE This merger is over! I will see you in court! 
CEO TED NORTON Not if we see you first, you prick! The execs furiously race out of the conference room, all of them reaching for their cell phones. War has been declared. The lawyers hurry after the clients, fruitlessly trying to coax them back to the table. Mitch frowns, oo, and tiptoes for the exit.. .until Flemming Steel III grabs his arm, furious. 
FLEMMING STEEL III Right now you need to give me one reason not to fire you. Mitch stammers, oh shit. 
MITCH Relax, dude ... this-this is all part of my master plan. 
FLEMMING STEEL III It is. 
MITCH Yes! Check it out: if we drag this out...we make more money, right? Don't we? Of course we do! And then we can bill the fuck out of them! Some of them don't even speak-ah the engrish so goo, you know what I'm saying? 
FLEMMING STEEL III That's your plan. 
MITCH Yes...? Is it...? It's not a very good plan, is it. 
FLEMMING STEEL III Son, what you've just said to me is highly illegal. You could go to jail for a very long time just for suggesting it... 
MITCH 
(SWEATING) We're lawyers! We're above the law! 
FLEMMING STEEL III I must say, I've never seen this side of you before, Lockwood. I always thought you were on the straight and narrow... 
MITCH Fuck that, ese. I'm straight up gangster all the way through. Flemming eyes him, determining his fate. Mitch can't breathe. 
FLEMMING STEEL III Fine, I'll roll the dice with you But if word of this gets out, I will throw you under the bus so darn fast you won't know what hit you. Now go put on some proper clothes. You look like Joe Pesci. Flemming Steel III hurries off. Mitch exhales, holy shit... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. VAN NUYS -- RANCH HOUSE -- DAY 
Dave nervously pulls up to a RANCH HOUSE in the Fiero, reading the address off his iPhone. Several crew trucks are parked out front, and PA's with headsets loiter about. Dave gets out wearing an ironed buttondown shirt tucked into khakis. He self-consciously untucks half his shirt, trying to look "cooler," as he approaches a nearby P.A. 
DAVE Yo, Mitch Planko is here. Where the fuck is Hair & Makeup? 
P.A. 
(POINTING) Um, trailer 3.. ? 
DAVE That's so real. Dave stiffly walks off as the P.A. eyes him, weirded out. 
INT. HAIR & MAKEUP TRAILER -- DAY 
Dave, now in leather pants, the top four buttons of his shirt undone, sits in the makeup chair, getting his hair styled. He studies the script, confused. Then a P.A. hurries in. 
P.A. I'm here to take you to set. Is there anything I can get you? Vitamin water, Pelegrino? 
DAVE No thanks. Hey, what does it mean when it says T.S., or B.T.S.? 
P.A. Titty Shot and Bouncing Titty Shot. 
(TO HEADSET) Steve Action is coming to set. Dave, alarmed, follows the P.A. out and 
THROUGH THE LOW BUDGET SET They've taken over this valley ranch house; cables, lights and sound equipment run everywhere. 
DAVE Wait! W-what kind of movie is this?! 
P.A. It's a lorno. 
DAVE I-I'm not familiar with that genre. 
P.A. Lorno? Light porno? Tits & shadows? You ever hear of Skinemax? 
DAVE Oh no. They arrive in 
AN ORNATE BEDROOM bedecked with cameras, grip equipment -- and thousands of lit candles. The P.A. unbuttons Dave's shirt even further and starts smearing his chest and face with Crisco oil. Just then, the fat balding director, VALTAN -- just Valtan -- from some ethnically cleansed Balkan state, 50's, blows in. 
VALTAN More oil! Make him shiny like fish! 
DAVE Excuse me, are you in charge here? I think there's been some sort of 
MATCH CUT TO: 
MITCH LOOKING EQUALLY OUT OF PLACE standing in the back of an auditorium as on stage, two dozen 5 year old GIRLS in tutus prance about, rehearsing a ballet. The teacher, MRS. KLEINMAN, fruitlessly tries to direct them. CAMERA FINDS CARA onstage, twirling around -- until a bigger girl, NICOLETTE PETERS, knocks her over. Mrs. Kleinman turns to see Cara splayed out on the ground, trying not to cry. 
BALLET TEACHER Oh Cara, do try to stay on your toes! Let's start again... In the audience, Mitch straightens: what was that...? 
INT. DAVE'S AUDI STATION WAGON -- DAY 
Mitch drives Cara home from ballet. She sits shotgun in her tutu, looking small and sad. 
CARA Shouldn't I be sitting in my carseat? 
MITCH Whatever, you're fine -- hey, what's up with that little blonde bitch who knocked you over? She looks a little surprised by her dad's language. 
CARA That's Nicolette Peters. She does that a lot, actually... 
MITCH So why don't you fight back? 
CARA Um, because you told me not to? You said I should strive for verbal resolution. 
MITCH Fuck verbal resolution! Put that whore on her back and shank her! Do you know how to make a shiv? 
CARA What? Mitch lights a cigarette with the car lighter. 
MITCH Listen to me, kid: the world is a cesspool of cruelty and violence. If someone comes at you with a knife, you gotta put their entire fucking family in the morgue, okay? That's called jailyard justice. Because if you don't come back hard on a bitch, your ass is gonna get sold for a pack of Camel Lights and a jello cup, y'understand? Always solve your problems with violence. Always. Cara nods, alarmed. 
CARA O-Okay Daddy...? 
CUT TO: 
DAVE LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA He's sitting at a booth in a bar, highly traumatized. 
DAVE I dry-humped a stranger's leg for three hours today... Sitting opposite him, Mitch downs a shot, exhausted. 
MITCH Cry me a river, dude: I dealt with ballet and your ass-hat boss today. 
DAVE Oh no -- what happened at work? 
MITCH Nothing! Nothing. (off Dave's look) I fixed it. (off Dave's look) Okay, but look, it was not my fault! The Japs started peppering me with questions and I had to improvise and then everyone got very emotional and, well... it looks like we're going to court. 
DAVE Oh my God tell me you're kidding. 
MITCH Yeah, your boss was pretty miffed, but then I told him this was all part of my master plan to make more money off our clients-- 
DAVE What. 1 
MITCH Yeah, turns out that's totally illegal, but the old man was surprisingly cool about it. Dave sits there, speechless. Mitch eats wings. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Hey, your secretary is sort of hot in like a Dame Judi Dench-playing-a- Nazi kind of way. Is she on the fuck team? 
DAVE 
(WEAK) I. .I just want to go home... 
CUT TO: 
DAVE AND MITCH DRIVING IN MITCH'S CAR as the sun sets. The windows are open and the wind is in their hair. They're very much not talking to each other... 
EXT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- EVENING 
Dave and Mitch head up Dave's front walk, solemn... 
MITCH What are you gonna tell Jamie? 
DAVE The truth. 
MITCH Can I highly recommend against that? 
INT. MITCH'S HOUSE -- EVENING 
Mitch and Dave enter to find Cara running down the stairs in her Dora the Explorer pajamas. Dave smiles and opens his arms, tired and overjoyed to see her... 
DAVE Hey, sugar-bug. .but she passes right by him and hugs Mitch. 
MITCH Dude, you are like the worst husband ever. 
DAVE I have a lot on my plate right now, man! You have no idea! 
MITCH Okay, look, calm down: I can hold down the fort for one night. 
DAVE Are you joking? You worked at my job for one day and you almost got arrested! What are you gonna do to my family?! 
MITCH Dude, the kids are already going to bed. 
(MORE) 
MITCH (CONT'D) I think I can handle watching Two And A Half fucking Men and falling asleep on the couch with the best of 'em. The only roadblock I foresee is: what do I tell Jamie? 
DAVE What do you tell Jamie.. .when? 
MITCH When she wants to have sex tonight. 
DAVE But it's Tuesday. 
MITCH I don't understand. You don't have sex on Tuesdays? A beat. Then Dave starts LAUGHING. It builds. Dave hasn't laughed this hard in a long time. He pats Mitch's cheek. 
DAVE That's adorable. Dave turns and exits the house, still LAUGHING... 
DAVE (CONT'D) You know what, give it a shot. 
MITCH Really?! You want me to bang your wife?? 
DAVE Sure, have at it! Let me know how it goes... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
Dave parks Mitch's Fiero on this shady Silver Lake street, glancing at the HOMELESS GUY stumbling by, a bit scared. 
INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
Dave enters Mitch's apartment and flips on the bright overhead light. The white walls are empty. A futon, TV, and four crates of bird seed are all that occupy the living room. 
DAVE Jesus, it's like a Swedish asylum-- 
And then Mitch's iPhone RINGS. Dave hesitates, then answers: 
DAVE (CONT'D) Mitch Planko, who the fuck is this? A sexy woman's voice purrs: 
SEXY WOMAN (O.S.) Hiii Mitch, it's Tatiana... Dave straightens, oh shit! 
DAVE Tatiana?! Hi! How, um, how are you? 
TATIANA (O.S.) I'll be better in a few minutes after I fuck you raw. CLICK. She hangs up. Dave freezes, wide-eyed. 
DAVE Oh my God. Oh my God. He quickly dials a number. 
INTERCUT WITH MITCH Sitting on the plush couch with Jamie, eating takeout sushi and watching Two and a Half Men on the huge plasma TV. The phone rings. Mitch sees the caller ID, then answers it. 
MITCH Hey dude, I take back everything I said about Two and a Half Men. This is some edgy shit-- 
DAVE Tatiana is on her way over! 
MITCH Nice. 
DAVE What do you think I should do?! 
MITCH I think you should fuck her, that's what I think you should do. Jamie looks over at Mitch, weirded out; he gets up and crosses into the hallway for some privacy. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Don't blow this for me, dude, she's my Tuesday night regular. 
DAVE But wouldn't I be...sort of... cheating on Jamie? Maybe? 
MITCH No! Cheating is when any part of your penis touches any part of another woman who is not your wife, and last I checked, your wang is safely tucked away in my incredibly lame triple-pleated sport slacks. 
DAVE But my mind is over here, doesn't that count... somehow? 
DAVE Oh my god I can see it kicking. You can, in fact, see the fetus moving around in her belly. 
TATIANA You know what? Fuck you, Mitch. Don't ever call me again. She yanks on her coat and storms out. Dave stammers. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM -- NIGHT 
It's bedtime. Wearing pajama pants and no shirt, Mitch brushes his teeth and fixes his hair, trying to look sexy. He sucks in his dad-gut in the mirror. 
MITCH Jesus, Dave, it's called a sit-up. Then he sees Jamie's dress land on the bedroom floor, followed by her bra... Mitch exhales: 
MITCH (CONT'D) Holy shit, I'm finally going to fuck Jamie. This is my greatest hour! I hope she likes it weird! Then, IN SLOW MOTION, Jamie enters the bathroom, nude, her hair gently blowing in the wind from an open window. She looks insanely hot. Mitch takes her all in, ravenous... 
MITCH (CONT'D) Oh my God I am going to ruin her-- And then she sits on the can. And starts taking a dump. Mitch's face drops, horrified. 
JAMIE I have to cool it on the Thai food. I've had the shits all day. 
Mitch just stares at her, dumbstruck, as we hear the LOOSE CONTENTS OF HER BOWELS empty into the toilet bowl. 
MITCH Oh my GOD. 
JAMIE Seriously -- light a candle. She keeps shitting. It sounds like Niagara Falls. Thunderous. Foregoing the candle, Mitch covers his nose with his forearm and stumbles out of the bathroom, nauseous... 
INT. BEDROOM -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
Mitch lies in bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling, horrified. Jamie slides in bed with him, touches his arm-- 
MITCH 
(RECOILING) 
DON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME! 
JAMIE What is your problem? 
MITCH Look, I am not attracted to you right now, okay?! So just... No means no, all right? No means no... TIGHT ON Jamie rolling over, confused and genuinely hurt... 
TIME DISSOLVE TO: 
PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then a second baby joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: 
JAMIE (O.S.) Your turn. 
MITCH (O.S.) Mmm? 
JAMIE (O.S.) It's your turn to feed the twins. 
MITCH (O.S.) Yeah...I really don't feel like it. Jamie turns on the light, pissed. 
JAMIE Are you fucking kidding me? 
MITCH No, it's 3 in the morning, you go do it. You're the mother. 
JAMIE Get the fuck out bed right now and go feed your fucking children or I will fucking cut you! Mitch is already scrambling out of the room, terrified. 
MITCH Yes Jamie I'm sorry Jamie! 
INT. TWIN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Mitch just looks at the twins, SCREAMING in their respective cribs, no idea what to do. He reaches for the phone. Dials. 
INTERCUT WITH DAVE in Mitch's apartment, jacking off to some (very small) internet porn on Mitch's iPhone. Then the porn disappears, and "DAVE LOCKWOOD CALLING" appears on screen. 
DAVE Oh come on... (answering, panting) What? 
MITCH I always thought your wife was a nice lady but she is neither nice nor a lady! She talks like a dock- worker and she shits like one too! Plus I used to think your kids were adorable but actually they're just really fucking annoying and crazy needy-- Wait, are you jacking off? 
DAVE What? No! 
MITCH So why are you panting? 
DAVE Look, I had to, I never get this kind of privacy anymore. 
DAVE First: attach the filter to the seal to the nipple... Mitch hears CLINK CLINK and spins to see that Sarah has crawled over to the KNIFE BLOCK and removed a BUTCHER KNIFE and a MEAT CLEAVER and is waving them about like rattles! 
MITCH Oh jesus oh jesus... Mitch approaches her, wide-eyed, tentative -- when Sarah giggles and spastically whips the cleaver at him! He barely sidesteps it, and it impacts into a cupboard door -- F-TWANG! 
MITCH (CONT'D) This is so fucked up! 
DAVE I know, right? And make sure you don't allow any air bubbles in. Mitch grabs a pair of tongs and, after a few attempts, snatches the butcher knife from Sarah's hands. Then he scoops her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother. Finally, he slumps over, trying to catch his breath. 
MITCH Dude. Listen to me: you need to go downtown first thing tomorrow morning and you need to find that fucking fountain... He starts pouring cow's milk into the babies' mouths. It splashes all over them, but they manage to lap up some of it. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Honestly, I'm really not sure how much more of this shit I can take. 
CUT TO: 
A DESK PLACARD READING "DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON" District Manager Carla Nelson sits behind her desk in her bland, putty office, the next morning. She is still bored. 
DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON Good news. Your formal information request was approved. Dave stops pacing, deeply relieved. 
DAVE Great. So where's the fountain? 
DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON Oh. We won't hear back for one to three weeks, maybe more. 
DAVE WHAT? How long can it possibly take you to find your own fountain?! 
CARLA MELSON DAVE One to three weeks, maybe One to three weeks, maybe more. more. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Thanks, Carla, you just ruined my life. Have an awesome day. Dave blows out of there, choking on his fury... 
MATCH CUT TO: 
DAVE RACING INTO HIS OWN HOUSE still furious. He looks around for Mitch. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Mitch?! Mitch?! Bad news, buddy! Dave bounds up the stairs... 
INT. NURSERY -- MORNING 
Jamie quietly CRIES as she gets the twins dressed for the day. Dave charges in-- 
DAVE Real bad news--! Jamie startles and quickly dries her eyes. 
JAMIE Dave's in the shower. 
DAVE Are you okay...? Dave enters, concerned, and instinctively starts helping her dress the babies. She watches him, a bit confused. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Come on, you can tell me. We've been friends forever... 
JAMIE 
(EXHALES) It's Dave ...he's been acting so strange lately. Last night... Last night he even told me he wasn't attracted to me... 
DAVE Oh my god I'm going to fucking kill him. 
JAMIE Just tell me honestly...is Dave having an affair? 
DAVE No. Jamie. I swear he's not. You're just going through a very temporary rough patch, okay? 
JAMIE Temporary? We've been in this rough patch for years 
DAVE (this is news to him) Y-You have?! 
JAMIE You don't want to hear about this. 
DAVE No I really do. Tell me everything. Jamie looks at him, sees the urgency in his eyes. Frowns. 
JAMIE It's not his fault, really...I love him with all my heart, you know I do, but-you remember Dave's family growing up. They were a mess. They had nothing. Dave's entire childhood was spent looking over the fence, wanting a better life. So he scrimped and saved and worked four jobs at once and put himself through school and built a better life for himself. I've always loved that about him. 
(MORE) 
JAMIE (CONT'D) No one ever gave him anything. The problem is, now that he's got a good life, he can't turn it off -- he's still looking over the fence, wanting something even better, a second house, more kids, a faster car, a bigger promotion, whatever it is that he thinks will finally make him happy. Dave reddens, defensive; this is hitting very close to home. 
DAVE well poor Jamie! You have an ambitious, hard-working husband who provides for you and your family -- how can you even stand it? 
JAMIE 
INT. DAVE'S AUDI STATION WAGON -- DAY 
They drive down the street, the car packed with groceries. 
DAVE When you're with Jamie, you should always be doing one of three things: asking her permission, complimenting her, or begging her forgiveness. It doesn't matter if she already said you could go to poker night, or if she looks like fucking Mothra in that dress, or if you didn't do anything wrong. Permission, compliments, apologies. That's all anyone wants to hear out of a husband's mouth. Here, let's practice: what's your favorite joke? 
MITCH Umm...? A rabbi, a priest--? BAM! Dave punches Mitch in the nuts. 
DAVE Trick question! No one fucking cares! You're Dave Lockwood, boring dad, you're not Jerry Fucking Seinfeld! Shut the fuck up! Mitch clutches his balls, hurt and scared... 
INT. PRE-SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY 
Dave and Mitch, wearing sombreros, sit behind a tiny desk in this colorful pre-school classroom, preparing the healthy snacks they just purchased for Cara and her rowdy CLASSMATES. 
DAVE These are called children, or dependents. Never disparage your own children -- everything they do is a miracle from God. When they're bad, it's only because they're tired or going through a phase. When other people's kids are bad, however, it's because of indulgent parenting or innate defects in the 
CHILD'S CHARACTER-- A cute little BOY snatches three apple slices. 
DAVE (CONT'D) One a piece, please, Dylan. 
(TO MITCH) Kid's a natural born criminal. If he sees 18, it'll be from the inside a jail cell. 
INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Dave walks Mitch through the office. 
DAVE This is called an office, or work. Think about whatever you most want to do here, and then do the exact opposite. You want to go home early? Great: stay all night. Hungry? Cool: don't eat. Think your boss is a total douche? Terrific: invite him to join your fantasy baseball league. A cute ASSOCIATE walks by and Mitch overtly eye-fucks her all the way past. Dave nut-punches him again. 
DAVE (CONT'D) You're married now, jackass! You can't look at other women, you can't talk to other women, you can't even be interesting around other women! Do everything in your power to de-sexualize yourself -- wear a fannypack, drive a Passat, affix electronic devices to your belt -- whatever it takes. If you're forced to interact with a woman, quickly find a way to mention that you're married. It doesn't even have to make sense. Just be like "Nice weather today, I'm totally fucking married." 
MITCH Wait, so I can't sleep with my wife and I can't sleep with other women? What is that? 
DAVE It's called marriage. Dave turns into his office, nodding at his mean secretary. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Good morning, Gladys. She scowls at him, confused, who's this guy? Then Mitch passes and wiggles his tongue at her, simulating cunnilingus. The old lady GASPS, appalled... 
INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS 
They enter Dave's office. 
DAVE Do you have any other questions? 
MITCH Yeah -- when's your free time? 
DAVE (COCK-PUNCHING him again) Have you been listening to one word I've said?! There is no fucking free time! You don't have a life anymore! You don't have a personality, or an identity, or a point of view! You are a dad! 
(MORE) 
DAVE (CONT'D) Your job is to allocate resources, to shuttle children from A to B, to deliver food at appropriate intervals, to clean up, to break down, to construct, to repair, to finance, to sooth, to make everyone else happy, okay? And when your day is done, you know what you get? 
MITCH Dry handjob? 
DAVE Nothing! You're not single anymore! No one gives you a cupcake every time you hold the door or speak in complete sentences, it's expected of you now, so grow up! 
MITCH Okay, can I just say something without you punching my cock? (Dave inhales, go) I think you might be taking some of this adult shit a little seriously-- 
VOICE AT THE DOOR Knock knock? Both men turn to see Sabrina in the doorway, looking lovely in a short skirt suit, holding documents. Mitch straightens. 
MITCH HELL-lo legs. 
SABRINA Yes...um...sort of big news. 
MITCH (solicitous, creepy) Please, come in! Coffee? Scotch? 
SABRINA (entering, tentative) No... thanks? Anyway, Kinkabe and Amalgamated have agreed to go into binding mediation in two days. 
DAVE Two days? Are you kidding me?! Sabrina glances at Dave, confused, no idea who he is. 
SABRINA N-No? Anyway, I'll have my briefs on your desk by tonight. 
MITCH (stretching leg on desk) And I'll have my briefs on your chin by tomorrow morning-- 
DAVE And that is Level 4 Sexual Harassment! Awesome! Thanks, Sabrina, that will be all. 
MITCH, SR. Nothing! Nothing. How are y--? 
MITCH I mean, you still have a really fucking cool son, right?! 
MITCH, SR. Yes, Mitch is definitely cool... How are the twins? 
MITCH They're fucking fine-- what the fuck does that mean, "Mitch is definitely cool?!" 
MITCH, SR. 
(TAKEN ABACK) Nothing. No, it's my fault... I spoiled him rotten after his mother passed away, but... He trails off, clearly not wanting to talk about this. 
MITCH But what, dude?! Spit it out! 
MITCH, SR. But now he's a total fuck up. Mitch actually GASPS. His dad smiles sadly: 
MITCH, SR. (CONT'D) I mean, he's a great guy, he's the life of the party, but he has no work ethic, he has no backbone, he'll never build a family or a career or anything of substance like you have. He's... embarrassing. Mitch stands there, mouth agape, just decimated. 
MITCH, SR. (CONT'D) Anyway, I'm sorry to go on and on. How's your lovely wife--? Mitch starts TEARING UP and fumbling with the car door. 
MITCH Your son is not a fuck up, M-Mr. Planko! He's just a late bloomer! His dad looks utterly confused as Mitch gets into the car. 
MITCH, SR. Dave? Are you crying...? 
MITCH I'm sorry, I'm just very close to Mitch and when people say mean things about him I hurt too-- He SLAMS the door shut and jerks out of the parking spot, tears pouring down his face. His dad watches on, bewildered. 
INT. DAVE'S CAR -- NIGHT 
Mitch angrily drives home, trying to stop crying. 
MITCH Fuck! Fuck... And then Survivor's "Eye of the Tiger" comes on the radio. Mitch's expression slowly turns to steely determination... 
CUT TO: 
BLACK STILLNESS As "Eye of the Tiger" continues playing, we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then we hear a second baby join in. Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: 
JAMIE 
YOUR TURN-- 
Mitch sits bolt upright in bed like Rambo, totally awake, his jaw set, and bounds out of bed... 
INT. NURSERY -- NIGHT 
Mitch aggressively changes the twins' diapers. He's doing a terrible job, but he's focussed, working hard... 
INT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT 
Mitch assembles two baby bottles as the twins sit in the sink SCREAMING. He SCREAMS back at them... 
INT. DEN -- NIGHT 
Mitch sits erect on the couch like a Navajo warrior, feeding the twins, his eyes afire... 
INT. DAVE'S CAR -- THE NEXT MORNING 
Wearing fingerless driving gloves, Mitch races the twins to day care. He looks like the fucking Transporter... 
INT. STEEL, KUHBACH, MCCLOUD -- LAW FIRM -- MORNING 
Mitch blows into the office, looking sharp in a business suit. He points at other lawyers, amped up, not smiling. 
MITCH 
LET'S DO SOME LAW, GUYS! GET SOME! His old secretary Gladys falls in step with him. 
GLADYS 
GOOD MORN-- 
MITCH I need the book CORPORATE LAW FOR DUMMIES, every season of Law & Order on DVD and Blu-Ray, and the biggest fucking coffee you can carry on my desk in 15 minutes or else you're fired. Gladys writes this down on a pad of paper, a bit turned on... 
MITCH (CONT'D) Also get yourself a new haircut and a pair of six inch stripper shoes. It's time to take this shit to the next level. 
CARA Always solve my problems with violence. 
MITCH That's right, baby. Bones. They bump fists. Jamie is stunned. 
JAMIE What?! No, angel, that's exactly the wrong lesson. You should never use violence, except to defend yourself, okay? Mitch subtly shakes his head at Cara, don't listen to her. 
MITCH Violence is cool. 
JAMIE Dave! 
MITCH I'm kidding! 
(TO CARA) I'm not kidding. Cara GIGGLES in the backseat. Jamie can't help but laugh too. Soon they're all LAUGHING. It's a nice moment. 
CARA I love you, Daddy... 
MITCH 
(SURPRISED) Oh. I-I love you too, angel. 
Jamie smiles over at Mitch... TIGHT ON MITCH as he feels the family love for the first time. He looks touched... even a little proud... Then his cell phone rings. He answers it: 
MITCH (CONT'D) Lockwood. 
DAVE (ON PHONE) I haven't been on a first date in over a decade and I'm drowning in my own fear--! 
MITCH Don't move. I'll be right over. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
MITCH KICKING OPEN THE DOOR of his old apartment to find Dave, in khaki's and a pressed buttondown, freaking out in the mirror-- 
DAVE How do I look?! 
MITCH Like a fucking tool. Step aside-- Mitch throws open the closet and yanks out a pair of jeans. 
MITCH (CONT'D) These are called jeans. They've been very popular with our nation's young people for over 60 years. Put them on immediately. 
DAVE Jeans? To a restaurant? Mitch punches Dave in the nuts; he doubles over. 
MITCH Shut up and do what I say. We only have 3 hours to make you cool... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MITCH'S BATHROOM 
Mitch shows Dave how to put gel into his hair. 
MITCH This is called gel, or product. Use too little and you look like a pedophile Cub Scout leader, use too much and you look Persian. Neither is a winning hand. Dave very nervously applies gel to his hair... 
INT. MITCH'S SHOWER STALL 
Dave stands with his pants around his ankles as Mitch very delicately shaves his balls with a Bic razor. 
MITCH Okay, normally I would never do this for another man, but since we're in a rush, and technically this is my testicle bag, I'm making a rare exception. Always man-scape before a first date. It shows a lady that you're clean, considerate, and American. 
DAVE 
IT TICKLES-- 
MITCH Don't speak, it jiggles your sack. 
EXT. EXOTIC MOTORCARS -- EVENING 
Exotic sells the most pimped-out used cars in LA. Mitch SQUEALS off the lot in a RED FERRARI and cruises down the Sunset Strip, music BLASTING. Dave sits shotgun, stunned. 
DAVE I can't believe you just charged a Ferrari to my Discover Card. 
MITCH You need to learn to be spontaneous, Dave. Chicks like spontaneous. (to WOMEN walking by) Hey ladies! Show us your tits! They flip him off. Mitch laughs. Dave is still floored: 
DAVE What are we gonna tell Jamie...? 
MITCH Do me a favor, Dave. Relax your butt hole. 
ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN 
DAVE (trying to be sexy) So: what school district do you live in? 
ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN 
DAVE Yikes, what do your parents think of all those piercings?! 
ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN 
DAVE .and that's the difference between a stroller and a pram. 
YOUNG WOMAN My car's ready. The YOUNG WOMAN races off towards her newly cleaned car. Dave slumps, shit. Mitch nods, looking at his watch. 
MITCH Forty seconds. Not bad. Your times are improving. 
DAVE I forgot how hard it is to be single... 
MITCH As a general rule, when you're talking to single women, conversation topics to avoid include: your wife, your children, your favorite playgrounds, and The Wiggles... Dave nods, hating himself. Mitch heads for the Ferrari. 
MITCH (CONT'D) But this was good. You worked out all your bad game and now you're ready to dominate. Come on. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FERRARI -- NIGHT 
Mitch rockets down Sunset Boulevard. Dave looks nauseous. 
DAVE I don't feel good about this. 
MITCH Relax: you're dressed cool, your hair is crushing it, your ballsack is taut and smooth, and you're way better looking than you've ever been. Just remember Uncle Mitch's Golden Rule of Dating. 
DAVE I know, always use an alias. 
MITCH What? No. No, my Golden Rule of Dating is always find the fun. Think of it like this: for the next two hours, you're stuck with this chick. Doesn't matter if she's cool or crazy or if she was born with a vagina on her forehead -- you're stuck, so make the most of it. I dated this chick named Topaz once who may or may not have killed her father. Long story short, she looked like 50 miles of bad road and I wasn't interested, but I used our time together to learn about incest and the failures of the American Appellate Court system. I found it hugely informative, and Topaz got caught up in my enthusiasm and gave me a crying blowjob on the car-ride home, so everybody won. The point is: find the fun for yourself and great things will follow. Dave looks horrified as they roll up to RICHTER'S, a chic steakhouse. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Power hug. Mitch hugs a still-speechless Dave... 
MITCH (CONT'D) Now go on. Make daddy proud. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RICHTER'S RESTAURANT -- A SHORT WHILE LATER 
Richter's is dark, elegant, romantic. Dave sits at a candle- lit table, anxiously folding and unfolding sugar packets. Then Sabrina enters, looking stunning in a snug red dress, and gazes around the restaurant. Dave's heart skips a beat, and he waves her over. She approaches, smiling. 
SABRINA Hey! 
DAVE Hey. Hi. Hello. He awkwardly goes to kiss her cheek while she goes for a handshake. It's awkward/cute. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Oh -- whoop -- okay. They sit. Dave stares at her, terrified. Then he blurts out: 
DAVE (CONT'D) Do you like Googoo Lady?! 
SABRINA What. . .what is that? 
DAVE I-I don't know! I really don't! Sabrina smiles politely and looks around for a waiter. Dave winces, hating himself to the very core of his being... 
SABRINA So. How long have you known Dave? 
DAVE M-My whole life, actually. 
SABRINA Annnd have you ever seen him act like he did yesterday? 
DAVE What, like a total douchebag? She LAUGHS. Dave can't believe it. He loosens up a bit. 
DAVE (CONT'D) That's not fair. Dave...Dave isn't himself right now. I hope he didn't say anything to offend you... 
SABRINA No. I mean, he totally did, but it's fine. I have brothers. Dave pours both of them a glass of wine, finding his rhythm. 
DAVE So. You like working with Dave? 
SABRINA I love it. He's the best. 
SABRINA Good night, Mitch. 
She gives him a thoughtful smile then disappears inside. Dave waits a second, then does a victorious karate chop, YES! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY MORNING Light floods into Mitch's apartment. Dave wakes up and looks at the clock: 9:02. 
DAVE Fuck that. He rolls over and goes back to sleep, a smile on his face... 
EXT. TOAST -- DAY 
Dave sits at an outdoor table, reading a novel and taking his time with brunch. He sees a BUSINESSMAN wolfing down his food and running off to his car, yelling into his cell phone, stressed out of his mind. Dave smiles and keeps reading... 
INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- DAY 
Dave sits on the toilet, reading his novel and taking a leisurely shit. We hear the clean KER-PLOP of a solid poo hitting the toilet water, and Dave closes his eyes, nice... 
EXT. BATTING CAGES -- DAY 
Dave, in a Dodgers jersey, tees off on baseballs in a batting cage. CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! It feels great... 
EXT. JUNGLE -- MOVIE SET -- DAY 
Dave, holding a cross-bow and wearing a loincloth, has fake sex with his CO-STAR on a jungle set; their mid-sections are conveniently obscured by a giant fern. Dave is selling it, and when Valtan calls cut, the whole CREW applauds, wildly impressed. Dave waves them off, bashful... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Looking hip in jeans, flip flops, and a mildly ironic tee shirt, Dave breezes into his office to find Mitch, in a pressed suit, intently studying a legal casebook at his desk. 
DAVE Well, well, look who's all growns up. 
Dave crashes on the couch, happy. Mitch looks annoyed: 
MITCH Really? Open-toed sandals at work? 
DAVE Are...Are you kidding me? 
MITCH Look, I can't hang right now, okay? I've got the mediation in like ten minutes. Dave stands right back up, surprised and impressed. 
DAVE Wow. Okay. Well, I just wanted t tell you that if you can get a protracted buyout for anything over 700 million dollars, take it, okay? 
MITCH 700 million, you got it. 
DAVE (heading for the door) Also, I wanted to thank you for setting me up with Sabrina. She's amazing. I can't wait to see her 
AGAIN TONIGHT-- 
MITCH What?! Dave: No. You can't, you have to wait at least a week! Dave reaches for his cellphone as he heads out the door. 
DAVE Which reminds me, I wanted to call to see if she got the flowers... 
MITCH You sent her flowers after one date?! Are you retarded?! Do not get me into a relationship, dude! Too late. Dave is already gone. Mitch scowls. Then: 
MITCH (CONT'D) You can come out now, Gladys... A second later, GLADYS, in a form-fitting suit and a sexy new bob, crawls out from under his desk. Mitch zips up his pants. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Look, honey, I don't think this is 
WORKING OUT-- Gladys YANKS him by the tie and gets in his face, wild-eyed: 
GLADYS I haven't had sex in 34 years! This isn't over tit I su e' it's over. 
MITCH F-Fine, but can you please stop following me to the bathroom and calling my house late at night and sending me all those filthy emails? It's, you know, deeply disturbing. 
GLADYS You need to realize something, boy: (whispering in his ear) I fucking own you now. The old lady aggressively makes out with Mitch. Her tongue roams from his mouth and madly licks his face, neck, and forehead. Eventually they separate. Mitch looks stunned. 
GLADYS (CONT'D) I left you a little souvenir in your pocket... She winks and exits. Mitch tentatively reaches into his pocket and pulls out a giant pair of TAN GRANNY PANTIES. 
MITCH I've created a monster... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Rain pours down outside. Then Dave and Sabrina, soaking wet in their Dodgers gear, run into the apartment. 
SABRINA Oh my god, I'm soaking-- (taking in barren apartment) Wait, are you a single guy? Dave laughs and throws her a towel from the bathroom. She starts drying her hair. 
SABRINA (CONT'D) I need a beer and some dry clothes. When Dave passes her, though, she stops him, and starts kissing him... 
SABRINA (CONT'D) Or maybe...mmm...maybe just a beer. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. CUT RESTAURANT -- MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
Mitch stands in the restaurant's upscale men's room, staring at himself in the mirror, lost... 
MITCH What am I doing...? This isn't my life... 
VOICE Good evening, Mr. Lockwood... He spins to see Gladys in the doorway, vamping, sexy... 
MITCH Oh no. Gladys, not now-- 
GLADYS (approaching, coy) I'm not wearing any bloomers... 
MITCH I thought we talked about not using 
THAT WORD-- WHAM! She throws him against the bathroom wall and starts aggressively undressing him. 
GLADYS What's bothering you, Mr. Lockwood? 
MITCH Look, Gladys, I love bathroom sex as much as the next guy, but-- She SPITS in his face, crazy-eyed. 
GLADYS 
TELL ME WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU! 
MITCH (wiping face, a bit scared) O-Okay? Well, I guess what's bothering me is...I didn't earn any of this, you know? Gladys rips open his shirt and starts licking his chest downward until she disappears OUT OF FRAME. 
MITCH (CONT'D) And I know what you're thinking: Mitch, not earning things never used to bother you, why does it bother you now? And the answer is: maybe I'm growing up. We hear the sound of his pants UNZIPPING... 
MITCH (CONT'D) I mean, sure, I closed the deal today, and that felt good, but I didn't put in all the years of hard work that got Dave to this point, you know? Plus, those aren't my adorable kids, that's not my beautiful wife, you're not even my freaky deaky old lady secretary. I want to earn this stuff-- Just then FLEMMING STEEL III BLOWS IN -- and stops cold: 
FLEMMING STEEL III 
GOOD GOD MAN! GO WIDE to see that Gladys is in the Reverse Wheelbarrow position, her palms on the bathroom floor, her feet against the bathroom wall, with Mitch between her legs, his pants around his ankles. Mitch sees his boss -- and freezes. 
MITCH Uh oh. 
FLEMMING STEEL III 
THE REVERSE WHEELBARROW?. Mitch and Gladys disengage and straighten themselves. 
MITCH Sir, it's not my fault--! 
FLEMMING STEEL III Have you forgotten everything you learned in law school?! You can't screw a direct hire! How can we possibly make you a partner now?! You're completely exposed--! We hear a GASP from the doorway. Everyone turns to see Jamie -- she's heard the whole thing. Mitch quickly zips his pants. 
JAMIE I thought you might be having an affair... but not with Gladys: 
GLADYS Age-ist. 
MITCH Jamie, you gotta believe me, this woman is a predator--! 
JAMIE You know what? No. I can't do this anymore. I want you out of the house by the time the kids wake up. 
MITCH Jamie--! Too late. She runs off, choking back tears... 
EXT. CUT RESTAURANT -- NIGHT 
Fastening his belt, Mitch sprints out of the restaurant, desperate -- but Jamie is already SQUEALING away in her car. 
MITCH FUCK! Fuck... He stands in the rain, overcome with self-loathing... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
MITCH It's... confusing grown-up stuff-- 
CARA Try me. 
MITCH O-Okay? Well. I'm leaving because I'm a fuck up. Do you know what a fuck up is? 
CARA 
(NODDING) Like Uncle Mitch. 
MITCH Right. Right. Well, I thought this time was different, you know? I thought I actually did something right for once. But no, I'm still the same old fuck up I've always been. Only this time I really fucking fucked up, because I fucked up my life and my best friend's life... Mitch zips up his bag, full of regret -- and finds Cara hugging his leg. 
CARA I don't think you're a fuck up. He crouches down and looks at her, getting choked up... 
MITCH Thanks, sweetie, but your brain is the size of a radish. I am a fuck up. I always have been, and I always will be. Guys like me, we know how to have fun, but we don't know how to do the important stuff, you know...? Be good, okay, kiddo? She nods, confused. He kisses her head and exits, emotional. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BMW STATION WAGON -- NIGHT 
The rain still pours down. Jamie, tears streaking her face, drives home in stop-and-go traffic. Then, through her side window, we see Dave sprinting alongside her car, waving! 
DAVE 
JAMIE! Not seeing him, she accelerates forward and Dave disappears from view. . .until she stops, and Dave catches up again: 
DAVE (CONT'D) 
JAMIE! Still not seeing him, Jamie accelerates onto 
THE 101 FREEWAY where the stop-and-go traffic moves only slightly faster. Jamie continues quietly CRYING to herself... Then we see 
DAVE RUNNING ALONG THE SHOULDER OF THE 101 in the driving rain, waving his hands and yelling! 
DAVE 
JESUS JAMIE! LOOK RIGHT! Finally, she glances over, sees Dave -- and startles: 
JAMIE Mitch? 
DAVE 
PLEASE PULL OVER BEFORE I DIE! Jamie, stunned, pulls onto the shoulder and stops. A second later, Dave hops into the car, soaking wet and panting. 
JAMIE What is the matter with you?! 
DAVE Look, I know I haven't been a very good husband or father recently... 
JAMIE What are you talking about--? 
DAVE But I'm done looking over the fence for something better. I've seen what's on the other side, and it's great. . .and young... and supple... but it's not you. And the truth is there will always be another fence with shinier toys on the other side, but the only way to be happy is to say fuck the fence and just appreciate what you have, you know? Find the fun with what you got... 
JAMIE O-Okay? 
DAVE I'm so sorry I stopped appreciating you, pumpkin. I love you. And I love our weird little kids. And I can't believe I ever thought that wasn't enough. 
JAMIE Why...are you calling me pumpkin? And then he kisses her. She resists-- 
JAMIE (CONT'D) Mitch--?. But he holds her firm. And soon she's kissing him back, confused and overwhelmed and crying... It's emotional and intense for him, too. They finally separate, but remain inches apart, breathing hard. 
Jamie stares into his eyes, amazed: 
JAMIE (CONT'D) Dave? Dave nods. Jamie squints, trying to understand. 
JAMIE (CONT'D) But...how? Dave shakes his head, I don't know... 
JAMIE (CONT'D) So...then ...Mitch was the one... with Gladys? Dave nods again. Jamie looks relieved... Then she stops. 
JAMIE (CONT'D) Wait, so who was that hot young thing back in the apartment? 
DAVE Nothing happened, I swear. 
JAMIE Okay. But-we're going to need to talk about this. 
MITCH Yes. We have to pee in it. 
DAVE It's a magic fountain. The workmen just look at them, deadpan. Then Dave reaches into his wallet and starts pulling out CASH-- 
SMASH CUT TO: 
MITCH AND DAVE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE AT THE FOUNTAIN with their pants down around their ankles. Dave starts PEEING. Mitch doesn't. Dave hisses at him: 
DAVE Come on, open the floodgates! 
MITCH I can't pee with them watching! PAN OVER to the workmen, standing nearby, looking at Mitch and Dave like they're total freaks. 
DAVE Well I can't keep going forever! Mitch tilts his head back and quietly sings to himself: 
MITCH The sun is shining all the time, Looks like another perfect day, I love L.A. We love it! I love L.A... 
DAVE Are you singing Randy Newman--? Then we hear a second stream of PEE hit the fountain. 
MITCH Oh thank god. 
DAVE Okay, quick, we have to hug! 
MITCH (glancing back at workmen) Do we, though? 
DAVE Yes, we have to do everything exactly the same! Come on! As they scootch together and put their arms around each other, Mitch calls over to the workmen: 
MITCH Just so you know, this isn't gay! Our penises aren't even touching--! 
DAVE Come on: "I wish I had my old life back" on three! One, two: 
MITCH DAVE I wish I had my old life I wish I had my old life back! back! 
JUST THEN A THUNDER CLAP CRASHES OUTSIDE The lights in the warehouse flicker. Dave and Mitch finish peeing and slowly zip up, exchanging a worried look... 
DAVE You think it worked? 
MITCH How the fuck should I know? (waving to workmen) Thank you! Have a pleasant evening! 
CUT TO: 
PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then we hear a second baby join in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: 
JAMIE (O.S.) Your turn.

DAVE (O.S.) 
YES! Dave turns on the light, rushes over to the mirror, and touches his face, overjoyed, clearly back in the right body. 
DAVE (CONT'D) Oh thank God. Thank God. Pumpkin, it worked! I'm back! 
JAMIE (groggy, half-asleep) Great, go feed the fucking babies. She rolls over and goes back to sleep. He grins and runs out. 
INT. NURSERY -- NIGHT 
Dave cheerfully sings as he changes Sarah's diaper. 
DAVE You just vomited on my hand but I love yooooou... 
INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT 
Dave bounces down the hallway, a twin in each arm, SCREAMING into each of his ears and taking turns kicking his balls... and he's grinning. In fact, he couldn't look happier. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- MORNING 
Mitch slowly wakes up in his empty apartment. He stares at the blank walls, a little bummed... Then he startles when SABRINA rolls over, looking ravishing. 
SABRINA Last night was weird. 
MITCH Wasn't it?

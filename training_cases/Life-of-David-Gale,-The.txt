"THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE" 
by 
Charles Randolph 
FIRST DRAFT 
March 1, 1998 
FADE IN: 
EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - SUNRISE 
A dishevelled WOMAN in a business suit (27) runs down a lonely highway in Texas hill country, moving desperately through the thick morning fog. She's carrying a VHS cassette. The sounds of her breathing and SHOES HITTING the PAVEMENT ECHO into the mist. 
She runs, and runs. 
She slows, out-of-strength, looks up and down the highway. 
Both in front and behind, it leads straight into the mist, a tunnel of fog. She stumbles on, a final effort. 
She runs. Sees something. Stops cold. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
WHITE 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. OFFICE OF "DEATHWATCH AUSTIN" - SUNRISE 
A clock on the wall: 6:11. 
Beneath the clock a simple banner reads "DeathWatch Austin." 
YOUNG MAN (O.S.) It's probably been about seven minutes... 
The office is small, cheaply furnished. One wall is filled with neat rows of 8x10's of death row inmates. 
About 30 percent have red crosses over their faces. 
Five people wait in tense silence. A SKINNY COLLEGE GUY with a mullet and pinch of Skoal in his mouth looks at a computer screen. A co-ed cuddles a Styrofoam cup of coffee, sobs quietly. A matronly woman sits quietly at a desk holding a phone to one ear. 
The clock's minute hand changes from :11 to :12. 
CONSTANCE HARRAWAY (36), bookish, sits beside DAVID GALE (31). He wears a blue Yale sweatshirt. They both stare at nothing. She bites her lip. 
COLLEGE GUY Okay. Okay. We've got pronouncement. 6:12. Roughly eight minutes. (a beat as he records the time) Number 36 this year for the Great State of Texas. 
They all exchange looks: they've lost. David stands. 
CONSTANCE David, don't start throwing things. 
A PHONE RINGS. David controls himself. 
DAVID I'm going home. Let's do the press fax tomorrow. 
Another PHONE RINGS. Constance stands. 
CONSTANCE Go. I'll do it. 
He nods to her, exits. 
She walks to the photo wall. With a red magic marker she marks a cross over the photo of a Hispanic male. 
The wall clock reads 6:13. 
EXT. PARKING LOT IN FRONT OF OFFICE - SUNRISE 
The office is in a largely abandoned mini-mall. It's going to be a clear summer day. David hurries through the empty parking lot to Volvo station wagon. 
As the car exits the lot, we see the Austin skyline with the capitol building in the distance. 
INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE 
David drinks from a travel cup as he drives, windows down. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - SUNRISE 
David stops at a red light beside a squad car with one cop inside. The cop gives him a cursory glance. 
INT. DAVID'S CAR - SUNRISE 
He stares at the cop. The cop looks neutrally ahead; behind him the buckle of his seat belt shoulder strap catches the reflection of the rising sun. 
BACK TO DAVID 
He stares, then: 
DAVID Hey! 
BILL (V.O.) Meaning you've just spent a very public seven days in jail for a very public contempt of court citation. 
BITSEY Protecting sources, even kiddie porn scumbags, is magazine policy. 
BILL (V.O.) And I, we continue to appreciate your decision. We're just concerned. A rapist slash murderer, five days before he's executed, demands a reporter known for protecting sexual deviants. A reporter who is also a very attractive woman -- 
Bitsey and Kruger moan in unison. 
KRUGER This is disparate treatment. 
BITSEY I could go if I were an ugly blabby guy? 
BILL (V.O.) There's an agenda issue here which would be diffused with an older male... 
KRUGER I hear lawyers gleefully saying the words Bloom vs. News Magazine Inc. 
BITSEY 'Well, Your Honor, I started to notice that my assignments were evaluated on the basis of my sex.' 
KRUGER You've gotta let her go now. 
BILL (V.O.) That's not quite what I meant. 
KRUGER He's gotta let you go. 
BITSEY 'Certain references were made -- ' 
BILL (V.O.) (interrupting) All right. All right. Enough. The intern is with you at all times? 
Bitsey vehemently shakes her head "no" to this idea. 
KRUGER Yes. I, we are hanging up. 'Bye. 
Kruger hangs up the phone before he can respond. 
BITSEY I'm not baby-sitting. 
Kruger reaches for a chip. 
INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT 
ZACK (boyish, 24) sits in the passenger seat, smoking and looking at a case file in his lap. He holds the cigarette just outside the slightly open window. Zack has a bohemian grunge thing going -- long hair, ultra-hip glasses. As Bitsey drives, she keeps looking down at the dash's instrument panel. We hear strained patience in her voice. 
BITSEY Gale was seen leaving the house. 
EXT. INTERSTATE 45 - NIGHT 
The car's lights move past a sign: "Huntsville 27 Miles." 
BITSEY (V.O.) His sperm was inside her. 
INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT 
BITSEY His prints were all over the kitchen, including one on the bag. 
Zack has a police photo: a woman naked on a kitchen floor, hands handcuffed behind her. Over her head is an opaque white plastic bag, sealed around the neck with duct tape. 
ZACK Half-a-thumb print. 
BITSEY Okay, half-a-thumb print. 
ZACK Could have touched it before it was a murder weapon. 
BITSEY Do you fondle your friends' garbage bags? 
ZACK Yeah, I get very touchy around household plastics. 'Hello, everybody -- ooooh, Tupperware.' Chill. I'm just saying the bag could have been out on the counter or something. 
She looks at him a beat. 
BITSEY Hey, Zack? 
ZACK Yeah. 
BITSEY He did it. 
ZACK But the murder's way too fucking clumsy. And this guy's a major intellectual. Top of his Yale class, a Rhodes gig, tenured at 27, two books. He's an academic stud. 
BITSEY And, empirically speaking, a psychotic. 
Zack picks up another file photo: Christmas shot of the Gale family: David (31), his wife (Sharon, beautiful, 29), and son (Chase, 6). 
ZACK Look at his wife, she's a regular Grace Kelly. Old money svelte. Father was Ambassador to Spain -- 
BITSEY (looking at the car's instrument panel) Shit! The light's on again. 
CLOSEUP - OVERHEAT LIGHT 
is on. 
BACK TO SCENE 
ZACK Ignore it. It's a rental. 
Bitsey ignores her, takes a menu without comment. She goes and sits across from Zack; he's reading Dialogical Exhaustion by David Gale. 
BITSEY Little early, isn't it? 
ZACK The non-smoking section's over there. 
BITSEY I meant the book. 
ZACK Oh. 
Bitsey opens the menu; he puts the book down. 
BITSEY What time is it? 
ZACK 9:15. The waitress says the Ellis Unit is about fifteen minutes out of town, so we've got like five and half hours. I -- 
BITSEY Never eat where the menus have pictures of the food. 
ZACK I was thinking we should drive to Austin, check out the crime scene. Could be some story stuff for us. 
BITSEY (without looking up) First, this isn't a story. It's an interview. We come, I listen, you watch, we go home. Second, there is no 'us' in the assignment. 
ZACK Okay, what do I watch you do for the next five hours? 
BITSEY (closing the menu) Drive around looking for decent restaurant. 
ZACK You know, your reputation as Siberian- Female-Dog-Person doesn't do you justice. 
She's unsure how to interpret his comment. He smiles. 
BITSEY My reputation got us invited here. I play by the rules. It's called objectivity. 
They stare at each other. Zack picks up his book, starts to read, affects a shiver. 
EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY 
Drizzle. The prison and adjacent parking lot can be seen a few hundred yards down the road. In front of the guardhouse is a sign: "TDC Ellis Unit. All visitors must report." 
SUPERIMPOSE: "DAY ONE" 
The rental car ENTERS the FRAME, brakes briefly for the empty guardhouse, and moves on toward the prison. 
EXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY 
Bitsey and Zack get out of their car. She has an umbrella. 
ZACK So where do we report? 
Three razor wire fences surround the prison. Guard towers rise at the corners. Outside the fence sits a small building with a sign: "REPORT HERE." 
Bitsey makes a there-you-have-it face. They move toward the building. 
Someone hawks. They look over. Within the fence, a skinny Hispanic inmate (50's) spits. He's hunched in the rain thirty yards away. He watches them neutrally. 
CAMERA TRACKS Bitsey and Zack as they walk nervously past a series of kennel-like pens that run along a long building. Inmates watch them pass: A smoking, tattooed white male (30's) stands by his door. A muscular black man (30's) with a Muslim skullcap speaks quietly to the forty-something redneck beside him. A paunchy Hispanic (20's) with a shaved head sits back against the building, making clicking sounds. A skinny white guy with his shirt off tosses a tennis ball against the building. At the closest end of the last pen, a gang-banger (20's) watches as he stands with his fingers clutching the chain-link above his head. Rain runs down his face. 
INT. ELLIS RECEPTION OFFICE 
As Bitsey and Zack enter, a clean-cut man in his forties is on the phone (DUKE GROVER). He waves them in and holds up a wait-just-a-second finger. 
GROVER Well, I don't rightly know one fraternity from another. But if we catch any those boys out here again, we're gonna Arrest and Prosecute... You do that, Susan... Bye now. 
The office has cheap wood paneling and a tired shag carpet. A portrait of GOVERNOR HARDIN (female, mid-50's) is on the wall, a large aerial photograph of the prison on the other. At a desk sits a WOMAN WITH TEXAS HAIR (40's). 
Grover hangs up. 
GROVER (to the Woman) Thank you, Margie. (turning to Bitsey and Zack) Correspondents Bloom and Stevens I presume. 
BITSEY Yes, hello. 
They shake hands. 
ZACK Stemmons. 
GROVER Stemmons. Sorry, won't happen again. I'm Duke Grover, T.D.C. community relations. 
Grover's demeanor suggests a successful Little League coach, his suit suggests J.C. Penny. He speaks quickly. 
MARGIE (WOMAN) He's usually real good with names. 
GROVER (to Bitsey) And these days I always like to ask, now do you prefer Miss, Mrs. or Ms.? 
BITSEY Bitsey. 
GROVER Bitsey it is. Margie, I'm stealin' your umbrella. 
MARGIE Okey dokey. 
EXT. ELLIS UNIT ENTRANCE 
Bitsey and Grover walk beneath their umbrellas toward the Unit gate -- Grover walks as fast as he talks. Zack follows, turns his collar up. 
BITSEY This is Zack. 
BELYEU Pleasure. (turning) And this is the man of the hour. 
They move toward David. A SPEAKER-SYSTEM LOUDLY (really loudly) interrupts: 
GUARD (V.O.) Sit down, Gale. 
All wince. David sits, smiles, a bit embarrassed. 
DAVID Hello. 
BITSEY Hello. 
ZACK Hi. 
BELYEU Now, why can't they turn that thing down? 
DAVID (to the microphone above him) My lawyer respectfully suggests you adjust the speaker-system volume. 
A beat. They all look over at the guard's booth. One of the guards makes a get-on-with-your-business gesture. 
DAVID They're practicing being cruel and unusual. 
BELYEU Mrs. Bloom, I'm sure you're a bitin' at the bit. 
Belyeu collects papers from the chair he was using and starts to stuff them into his antique carpetbag. 
BELYEU Now, it is our understanding that you are to have three two-hour sessions. Today, tomorrow and Thursday, all at three in the P.M. I'm sorry we can't afford you more time, but contrary to popular rumor we have not yet begun to fight. Furthermore, it's our understanding that you will do this with no recording equipment of any kind. (to David) You have my Gregg book? 
DAVID I need it for Billy's appeal. 
BELYEU (to Bitsey) My client's got a ten pound bass on the line and he's worried about baitin' his neighbor's hook. (takes out his planner) Now, I have some papers for which I need your Jo Ann Hancock. (handing her a business card) Come by my Austin office at your earliest convenience. Thursday mornin', say. 
Bitsey's confused. Belyeu just smiles at her, then looks up at the microphone. She understands, nods. 
BELYEU Fine, till Thursday then. 
Belyeu picks up his bag. He and Zack start the hike to the door. Belyeu turns, walks backwards. 
BELYEU Good luck, Miss Bloom. (to David) I'll come by later. We can play a game of hangman, take up smokin'. 
David waves "get lost." Belyeu turns. 
BELYEU Bye, ya' all. 
They watch him walk away. Bitsey turns to David. He's looking at the floor, caught in a thought. 
BITSEY So... 
DAVID Sorry. Have a seat. 
She does so. David smiles at her, he has a beautiful smile, sincere, charming, vaguely devilish. 
BITSEY He's a character. 
DAVID Yeah, known Benny most my life. Met the summer after 4th grade, spent the day burning ants with his dad's magnifying glass. We called it playing 'Execution.' 
David looks at her a beat, lets the irony of this sit in the air. Uncomfortable, Bitsey starts to look in her purse. 
DAVID Since I grew up in foster homes, he's become the only family I have. 
BITSEY Where's your ex-wife? 
Bitsey takes a pad out of her purse, looks for a pen. 
DAVID We agreed minimal contact would be easier. Please don't mention her, or my son. 
BITSEY All right. Anything else, just clearly say, 'off the record.' I'll take it to my grave. But then you know that about me. Otherwise I wouldn't be here. 
David smiles, nods. 
BITSEY (referring to the pen) Is this recording equipment? 
He shrugs. 
DAVID How should we start? 
BITSEY I'd say you're a man with a story to tell, Mr. Gale. You chose the magazine, the format. You chose me. 
She sits with pen on paper, poised for dictation. 
BITSEY Go. 
David looks at her a long beat, then gives her the smile. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
WHITE 
DISSOLVE TO: 
She affects a solicitous shyness -- then goes all sex. 
BERLIN Any thing. 
He checks the room, then comes over to her, close. 
DAVID Tell you what, I'll give you good grade, a really good grade, if you will... (leans down to her ear, whispers sensually) ...study. 
He smiles, turns, walks away. As she watches, anger builds. 
INT. U.T. HALLWAY - DAY 
David comes out the room. Constance sees him, hurries to him. She's excited, and speaks now -- as always -- with absolute authority. They talk as they walk down the crowded hall. 
CONSTANCE David! 
DAVID Hey. 
CONSTANCE The T.A. finished transcribing the Governor's radio and TV comments. Listen: 'I hate killing, that's why I'm willing to kill to stop it.' The woman breathes in soundbites. 
She hands him a copy. 
DAVID (pretends to read a quote) 'Yes, Virginia, the people of this State have overwhelmingly affirmed the reality of Santa.' 
CONSTANCE You might can use some of her pre- centrist stuff. 
DAVID Tell me again why you aren't doing the debate. 
CONSTANCE Telegenics. You have a cuter butt. 
DAVID I hadn't noticed. 
CONSTANCE I know. 
DAVID That's not what I meant. 
EXT. U.T. CAMPUS - DAY 
David and Constance exit the building into the sun. 
CONSTANCE She's gonna do the whole mother thing. She empathizes with you completely, but experience has given her the courage to take the tougher road, ta- da, ta-da. Keep it rational. And flirt politely. 
DAVID 'Governor, you bat a lovely lash for a woman who executed thirty eight last year.' 
They've come to a sidewalk junction, stop. 
CONSTANCE And watch your ego. Don't come across as one of those I-hate-authority- because-nobody-in-charge-reads-the- New Yorker types. 
DAVID Anything else? 
CONSTANCE Yeah, don't fall into one of your brooding silences. Oh, I'm getting new federal stats from Amnesty tonight. 
DAVID I'm going to Greer's party. Fax them to Sharon's number at the house. 
She looks at him sternly over the top of her glasses. 
CONSTANCE If you have a hang-over tomorrow -- 
DAVID (hangs up, walking away) Apropos playing Mother. 
CONSTANCE (calling after him) Ten o'clock! (beat) Bright-eyed and bushy tailed! 
EXT. GALE HOME - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
The house is an immaculately restored two-story Victorian, far better than what a university professor can afford. 
The grounds are perfect. David's Volvo is in the driveway, his wife's new Laredo beside it. On the street out front sits a new VW Beetle. 
INT. KID'S ROOM - NIGHT 
David's son -- CHASE -- sits in bed holding a stuffed sheep in the air. David turns off the light in the adjacent bathroom, comes in holding his son's jeans and shoes. David wears a t-shirt which says "Evil-Doer & Curious Person." The room is over-decorated with boy stuff. 
DAVID Did you mark your calendar? 
CHASE (looking up at it) Yep. 
INSERT - KID'S CALENDAR 
hangs above the bed, opened to the month of March. It has a felt-tipped pen hanging from a piece of string taped to it. Ten frowny faces cover ten consecutive days, then there are three empty days before a large smiley face awaits on the fourth. The frowny faces are in a kid's hand, the smiley face in an adult's. 
BACK TO SCENE 
CHASE (counting on his fingers) Only... three more Spain days. 
David puts the jeans and shoes away. 
DAVID Only three. That's great, huh? 
David comes and sits beside his son. Points to an African statue (a man holding a spear) on the bedside table. 
DAVID What's he doing in here? 
DAVID The part of the foreskin that gets thrown away. I think it's called schmuck. 
BERLIN Aren't we so fucking clever. 
ROSS (standing, escaping) I suppose I should get us another. David? 
DAVID Black Bush. 
Ross walks to the bar. Berlin comes around and sits in his seat. Her mid-drift T-shirt reads "Sex is Power." 
BERLIN You were a jerk this afternoon. 
A beat. She's turned facing him, he looks forward. 
DAVID For what it's worth, I didn't know about the suspension. 
BERLIN Is that supposed to be an apology? 
DAVID More like a conciliation. 
ON FOOD AND DRINKS TABLE 
Ross has two gin-and-tonics and is finishing pouring David's Black Bush. He moves away. The table is neatly laid with snacks and bottles. The flower arrangement is perfect. 
SAME SCENE - LATER 
The table is now in mid-party chaos. Food spilled, bottles empty, the flowers in disarray. "I'M TOO SEXY" PLAYS LOUDLY in the background. Berlin takes a bottle of Red Label from the table. 
CAMERA TRACKS her THROUGH the living room, where a few people now dance, and out onto the patio. 
A crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool. They surround two patio chairs which face each other, one with David, the other with Ross. The men are playing an Irish drinking game -- the crowd has chosen favorites. 
ROSS (slurring a bit) All right. (clears his throat) As the poets have mournfully sung, Death takes the innocent young, The screamingly funny, The rolling in money, And those who are very well hung. 
Laughter, a few animated moans. David raises his glass to Ross and downs a whiskey. Someone starts to chant: "Gale! Gale! Gale!" 
DAVID (feeling good but very much in control) There once was a lesbian from Canjuom, Who took a young man to her room, And they argued all night, As to who had the right, To do what, how, and to whom. 
Laughter. Two women holding each other boo. Ross drinks. 
BERLIN One more. C'mon, one more. 
DAVID Enough. That's enough. 
The crowd wants more. Someone makes chicken sounds. 
ROSS Do you bow to the Queen? 
David looks at him, contemplates, then smiles. He holds his glass out for a refill. The crowd applauds. 
FULL SHOT OF PATIO 
The crowd is chanting: "Ross! Ross! Ross!" 
SAME SCENE - LATER 
The crowd has dispersed. A couple of small groups converse. Someone is being thrown into the pool. TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS. Inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it. 
INT. BATHROOM 
David is washing his face. As he dries, the TECHNO MUSIC downstairs gets BRIEFLY LOUDER. He looks from beneath the towel into the mirror. Berlin has entered the bathroom. 
DAVID I'm done. 
She locks the door, leans back against it. She's flushed. 
He folds the towel. 
BERLIN I'm not a student anymore. 
DAVID Don't think I want to know what that means. 
David lays the towel down, leans back against the sink -- they face each other on opposite sides of the bathroom. 
BERLIN There once was woman named Berlin, Who liked a bit now and again. Not now and again, But Now! And Again! And Again! And Again! And Again! 
He laughs. 
BERLIN Cute, huh? 
DAVID Cute. 
BERLIN I have a secret. But I have to come over there to tell you. 
He makes an I'm-not-so-sure face. She moves playfully toward him. 
BERLIN Here I come. 
She comes up to him, leans into him as she puts her mouthclose to his ear. He keeps his hands back on the sink counter. 
BERLIN (whispering) I wasn't after the grade. 
Berlin is pulling David into her. They approach a climax. 
She scratches him on the small of the back. Blood trickles. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
The MUSIC and dancers are in pure FRENZY. Suddenly, the MUSIC STOPS. Greer stands by the STEREO, his hand coming back from the power button. He gestures "that's-all-folks." 
INT. BATHROOM 
David and Berlin stand still and apart, breathing heavily into the reality-inducing silence. He looks at her in the mirror, a look of shame. She gives him an odd smile. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
BLACK 
FADE IN: 
INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Constance wakes with a jolt, sweating. She gets up and goes into her bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
She turns on the light, moves to the sink, opens the medicine cabinet. It's stacked with prescription medicines. Suddenly, she turns to the toilette, vomits. 
FADE TO: 
BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
INT. BARNES & NOBLE COFFEE HOUSE - DAY 
David and Constance sit by a window, the U.T. campus in the b.g. David's distracted, wearing a suit and a long face. She's wearing the closest thing she has to business attire. She has stacks of paper spread in front of her. 
CONSTANCE Okay, let's say we find an innocent on death row. Wouldn't matter. Corrections would let him go. Governor Harding would go on TV, say, 'Thanks to the good people at DeathWatch, the system works.' Yeah, if they executed an innocent, and we had absolute, undeniable, in-your-face proof, we could demand abolition. Just like happened in England. Are you okay? 
DAVID (coming out of it) Sorry. Yeah. 
He makes an effort, plays the "good listener." 
CONSTANCE But it hasn't happened, not since '76. And won't happen. 
David nods. 
CONSTANCE Dead men can't make a case. 
DAVID And 'Almost Martyrs' don't count. 
CONSTANCE Just keep it rational. The death penalty is expensive and ineffective. No one wants to see a murderer as a victim. 
DAVID Um-hum. 
CONSTANCE And stop that. 
DAVID What? 
CONSTANCE Active listening. I hate active listeners. Makes me feel like I'm with a Dale Carnegie grad who cares more about appearing to listen than actually listening. Did you bring the Amnesty fax? 
DAVID I can listen and appear to listen at the same time. Yeah, no. Damn, I left it home. 
CONSTANCE I have a copy. 
She looks through her papers, finds the copy in the stack beneath her coffee cup. She starts to hand it to him. He is looking out the window, caught in a thought. 
CONSTANCE You want to tell me what's up. 
DAVID Nothing. Everything. Something profoundly stupid happened last night. 
CONSTANCE (teasing) I hope you used a condom. 
A beat. His reaction tells her the jest hit home. 
CONSTANCE Jesus Christ, David. Was she one of yours? 
A longer beat. He holds her eyes. 
DAVID It was Berlin. 
She's stunned, then genuinely angry. 
CONSTANCE Oh, that's great, great. I can hear the grapevine now. They suspended her so Gale could dick her with a clear conscience. 
He looks at his coffee, which he hasn't touched. 
CONSTANCE A power differential equals coercion. Great. You are so weak. 
DAVID Constance, you're not my wife. Thank God. 
CONSTANCE I know you can tell yourself it's a position I aspire to, but believe me, I would rather... 
She moves toward her handlers. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN You folks keep up the good work. We need that opposition. 
Constance's and David's polite smiles follow her. 
EXT. TELEVISION STATION - DAY 
Constance and David argue as they walk the sidewalk to the parking lot. 
CONSTANCE Your exact words were, 'Just tell me when my ego gets in the way of the work.' Now I'm telling you: Your ego's in the way of work. 
DAVID (indicating the station) Look, I wanted you to do this anyway. 
CONSTANCE You put up precisely two seconds of protest at the thought of a televised debate. 
DAVID What's that supposed to mean? 
CONSTANCE It means DeathWatch suffers because you're so anxious to finger authority, to publicly prove that David Gale is so much fucking smarter than the powers that be. Learn to work without an audience. Try squeezing money from the donor list. Have you ever licked one single mail-out envelope? 
They come to the end of the sidewalk, where two SUITS are standing -- one Hispanic, one white (30s). 
MAN #2 (SUIT) Mr. Gale? 
DAVID Look, guys, there's not much more to say -- 
MAN #2 Rameriz, Austin police. This is Officer Haslinger. 
The officers show their Ids. Constance takes one to examine it more closely. 
DAVID What, arguing with the Governor is a crime? 
The officers exchange a look. 
MAN #3 (SUIT) No, sir, rape is. 
Constance and David look at each other, stunned. 
OVERHEAD SHOT 
CAMERA QUICKLY CRANES UP and ROTATES. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
WHITE. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY 
CAMERA CRANES DOWN and ROTATES, ENDING UPRIGHT BY Bitsey as she listens to David. 
GUARD (V.O.) (over the loudspeaker) Gale, time's up. 
The speaker, loud as ever, startles Bitsey. David nods over to the guard's booth. 
DAVID Berlin had my bite marks, bruises, ripped clothing. My skin was beneath her nails. It didn't look like anything but rape. Two days later she called the D.A., said she wouldn't testify, too drunk to be sure, etc. On the plane home, Sharon read about her husband's rape case being dropped. 
BITSEY Why'd she do it? 
A guard approaches. David stands up and moves to the back of his cage, puts his hands behind him and out the slot in the back to be handcuffed. 
DAVID (shrugs) Finger authority, show she was smarter than the powers that be. 
BITSEY Do you know where I can find her? 
DAVID First year in here I received a card postmarked San Francisco. It wasn't signed, but I suspect it was from her -- the front had the text 'Sex is Power.' 
Cuffed, David stands aside for the cage door to be opened. 
BITSEY Anything written on it? 
DAVID Yeah. It said, 'I'm sorrier than you can know.' (exiting the cage) See you tomorrow, Ms. Bloom. 
EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Bitsey and Zack are walking from the Kettle to their rooms. Zack is lighting a cigarette. The rain's stopped, but the lot is wet. 
BITSEY Try phone records, a net search. 
ZACK Fucking better than watching you work. 
They walk a beat in silence. 
ZACK You think he's telling the truth? 
BITSEY Don't ask me that. I don't know. There is no truth, only perspectives. 
ZACK Can't say that. If you say 'there is no truth,' you're claiming it's true that there is no truth -- it's a logical contradiction. 
BITSEY Working on our philosophy merit badge, Zack? 
She takes them to the coffee table. Among her own things, a dusty Johnny Walker Black Label bottle sits beside a tumbler (an index card with the #1 leans against it). The area has been outlined on the table with white shoe polish. 
GOTH GIRL She let him crash here sometimes. He was like constantly wasted. Drank Black Label religiously. 
Bitsey and Zack exchange a look. The Goth Girl moves into the kitchen. It's cluttered and dirty except in the various areas which at one point had been outlined and indexed -- the cards are all dirty. A sliding glass door leads onto the patio. The backyard hasn't been mowed in years; roughly twenty pots with dead plants lying around. 
By the door, three small taped Xs are on the floor, outlined and indexed (#2). 
GOTH GIRL This is where the tripod was. My boyfriend borrowed the one we usually show folks. They never found a camera, photos, or videos or anything. Gale must have buried them. These serial killer dudes take photos to whack off to later. 
ZACK He's not exactly a serial killer. 
GOTH GIRL Whatever. 
She moves to the sink. On the linoleum, the position of Constance's body has been chalk-lined (#3). In this area are a pair of handcuffs (#4). Not far off is a roll of packing tape (#5). A pair of latex kitchen gloves are crumpled on the sink counter (#6). 
GOTH GIRL She was like totally naked right here. The meter man saw her through the door. Gale handcuffed her, taped her mouth, then taped a bag over her head so she couldn't breathe. My boyfriend says that's probably when he fucked her. Your muscles tense up when you die -- the sex is better. (pointing) He used those housewife gloves so he wouldn't leave prints. They found sticky stuff from the tape on them. 
Zack picks up the gloves. 
GOTH GIRL We ask folks not to touch the exhibit. 
ZACK Right. 
He puts them back. 
GOTH GIRL The totally sick part was where they found the key -- 
BITSEY We know, you can save that. 
ZACK What? Where was it? 
GOTH GIRL It was in her stomach, dude. He made her swallow it before he bagged her. 
A beat. Zack's shocked. 
GOTH GIRL That's pretty much the highlight. 
Got questions? 
INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY 
Bitsey drives. They are on the two-lane highway to Huntsville. Zack smokes out the window. 
BITSEY It was in the case file. 
ZACK Fuck, in her stomach? That's colder than Wisconsin. 
BITSEY (looking in the rearview mirror) Zack, open your vanity. 
ZACK What? 
BITSEY The vanity mirror, pull it down. 
He does so. 
BITSEY See that truck behind us? 
ZACK Yeah. 
BITSEY Isn't that the cowboy from the rest area? 
They look in their respective mirrors. Some distance behind them is the older cowboy in his pickup. 
ZACK Same truck. 
BITSEY Weird coincidence, huh? 
ZACK (turning) Coincidences are always weird, that's why they're coincidences. 
INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY 
Bitsey sits in front of David. He's less animated than the day before, drained. He rubs his wrists. They are speaking in hushed tones. 
A beat. 
DAVID Off-the-record? 
BITSEY Alright, we're off. 
DAVID Constance was murdered with what's called the Securitat Method. You're hand-cuffed, forced to swallow the key, taped at the mouth, a bag's sealed over your head and you're left to suffocate. The Securitat did this to Romanians who wouldn't inform or confess. Sometimes the bag was ripped off at the last second, you got a second chance. If not, you die knowing the 'key' to your freedom was inside you the whole time. A cheap-but-effective metonym. Problem is I mentioned the method in an early article. The prosecution never knew. 
BITSEY You're telling me someone's framing you? 
DAVID It's more than that. 
DAVID There was a tripod. 
BITSEY Right, facing her body. Are we on? 
DAVID (nods agreement) Not a single print was found on it. Someone brought it, wiped it, left it. Why? It's as if they wanted me to know that somewhere there's a record of what really happened that afternoon. As if they wanted me to die knowing the key to my freedom was... out there. 
DOCTOR How we doing? 
DAVID Fine. How's Constance? 
DOCTOR Sleeping. 
A beat as he collects himself, sits up. 
DOCTOR Mr. Gale, a leukemia patient's condition is highly susceptible to external stress. While we don't want to totally restrict Constance's life -- 
DAVID What? 
DOCTOR Constance's illness requires a degree of regularity. 
DAVID Constance has leukemia? 
DOCTOR Acute. She was diagnosed last fall. 
A beat as the situation clarifies for both of them. David is stunned, the doctor embarrassed. 
DOCTOR Have I created a problem? 
DAVID No, no. 
They sit in silence. The hospital intercom seems to say: 
GUARD (V.O.) Gale, time's up. 
CLOSEUP - DAVID 
CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
WHITE. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - CLOSEUP - BITSEY - DAY 
CAMERA SLOWLY ROTATES. Bitsey stares at David, engrossed. 
DAVID When I asked why she hadn't told me, she muttered, 'too busy.' I guess she figured as long as death was chasing her, she could help others escape. 
He stands, goes to the back of the cage to be handcuffed. 
DAVID Constance left the world better than she found it. (beat) It's a small, difficult thing. 
EXT. ELLIS UNIT PARKING LOT - DAY 
The rental car sits in a corner of the mostly empty lot, as far as possible from the razor-wire fence and exercise pens. 
INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY 
Zack waits in the driver's seat, smoking. He looks nervously through the windshield toward the pens. Bitsey raps on the window, startling him. 
ZACK Fuck. 
Zack unlocks the door, throws his cigarette out. Bitsey opens the door and gets in. 
ZACK Hey. 
BITSEY (waving her hand at the smoke) For God's sake, Zack. 
ZACK You're not a happy camper. 
BITSEY It's not a happy place. 
He STARTS the CAR. 
ZACK Talked to the Austin prosecutor. Belyeu's a yokel. Prosecutor says he fucked up the penalty phase, says Gale probably would have gotten life on mitigating factors. Gale stuck with him, though, all through appeals, despite major pro bono offers. 
BITSEY What else? 
ZACK Notta on Berlin, we pick up the money in Houston tonight, overheat light came on twice, and you're about to get a surprise. 
BITSEY I don't want a surprise. 
ZACK (pointing ahead) Too late. 
EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY 
The guardhouse is now occupied. The crossing guard is down. Across the drive sits a Texas Highway Patrol car. 
All along the drive's left side, protest vehicles are parked in the grass. They stretch out to the two-lane highway, where another Highway patrol car is stationed. 
The drive's right side is also marked off, though the only vehicle on this side is a Houston TV news truck. Six people in ponchos discuss something in the middle of the drive. 
The rental car ENTERS the FRAME. 
INT. RENTAL CAR 
BITSEY Look. 
She holds up the cassette. It has a label typed from an old typewriter: "For Bitsey Bloom." 
EXT. MOTEL SIX RECEPTION - DUSK 
Zack runs out the front door carrying a VCR, the cables drag the ground behind him. He runs toward the rooms. 
INT. BITSEY'S MOTEL ROOM - DUSK 
Bitsey unlocks the door, lets Zack in. 
ZACK She says no one asked for you. And all the room keys are different. 
He goes to the TV. 
ZACK Just she and her husband have masters. 
BITSEY What did you tell her? 
ZACK That you have a jealous boyfriend. 
He starts to hook up the VCR. 
BITSEY Thanks. How about the V.C.R.? 
ZACK She didn't ask. I think she assumed it had something to do with why he was jealous. I still say we should do this in my room -- this one's a fucking crime scene. 
BITSEY Whoever got in here -- without a key in broad daylight -- was probably smart enough not to leave prints. I have the remote. 
He turns ON the TV. 
ZACK Maybe they could look for D.N.A. Try three. 
BITSEY (hitting the remote) They don't look for D.N.A. when someone breaks in to deliver, Zack. Here. 
She hands him the tape. He starts to put it in, hesitates, looks back at her. 
ZACK You sure you want to see what's on here? 
BITSEY No. Start it. 
He puts it in, pushes play. She sits on the bed. He sits beside her. They watch the black leader appear. 
BITSEY I hope this isn't what I think it is. 
CLOSEUP - TV 
An image flickers in. It's a woman lying nude on the kitchen floor of house 3307, facing away from the camera. 
An opaque white kitchen bag is over her head, sealed at the neck with duct tape. Her hands are handcuffed behind her. She appears dead. 
BITSEY (O.S.) God, no. 
ZACK (O.S.) Fuck. Is it her? 
BITSEY (O.S.) Turn it up. 
BACK TO SCENE 
They stare at the screen, she bites a thumbnail. He turns the sound up. 
INT. HOUSE 3307 - KITCHEN - DAY (ON TV) 
Hi-8 video: The woman does not move. The kitchen is cleaner than we've seen it, but otherwise unchanged. 
Kitchen gloves can be seen -- laid upside down and inside out -- on the dish rack beside the sink. Near the body on the floor is a roll of duct tape. In the lower right corner of the screen is part of what looks like a towel. 
The audio is full of ATMOSPHERIC HUM. A REFRIGERATOR contributes. BIRDS can barely be heard in the distance, so can what sounds like a LAWN MOWER. 
Suddenly, the woman makes a muffled sound, seems to come to life. Her wrists start to pull against the handcuffs, then jerk at them. She panics. He legs flail, kick against the counter. She screams, muffled, frantic. She rolls onto her stomach, her whole body fights against the cuffs. She desperately rubs her face along the linoleum trying to rip the plastic. Soon, her energy wanes, she jerks less. Her covered face now points toward the camera. Her head seems to rock, a sleepy nod. Her body goes slack. Black. 
EXT. MOTEL SIX GANGWAY - DUSK 
Bitsey stands at the railing, looking out at the interstate and a thunderstorm gathering on the horizon. 
After a few seconds, Zack comes up beside her. 
ZACK Belyeu says to bring the tape first thing tomorrow. Also said you were right about not calling the police. 
A beat, she keeps looking straight on. 
ZACK Are you gonna be okay? 
Bitsey takes a deep breath, turns to him, holds his eyes. 
She shakes her head no. Her lips start to tremble. He puts his arms around her as she starts to cry. 
INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Bitsey and Zack sit at a booth having coffee. Zack smokes. The VHS cassette is also between them, as is a small stack of crumpled tissues. The thunderstorm can be heard in the distance. The waitress is refilling their cups, and they wait until she leaves. Hushed tones. 
The Clerk puts the last of the money back into the suitcase. 
CLERK All here, Mr. Belyeu. 
BELYEU (to the Clerk) Thank you, Joshua. (to Bitsey) To add to our troubles, your own credibility may come into question. 
The Clerk exits. 
BITSEY Why? 
BELYEU You've been fraternizin' with the condemned. In the court's eyes, he's the most likely candidate to have put you onto the tape. He's a persuasive man, you're a out-of-state woman -- it don't look good on paper. 
BITSEY But someone put it in my hotel room. 
BELYEU A fact for which we have no evidence. 
A very professional-looking assistant enters, hands Bitsey her video. 
BELYEU Thank you, Bobbi. 
BITSEY Thanks. 
BELYEU (standing) Well, let's not start readin' Kafka just yet. Could we find a sympathetic judge. I'll file within the hour. You headin' back over to Ellis? 
BITSEY (standing) Yeah. 
BELYEU Fine. I'll call over at the motel later and give you an update. 
INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY 
Bitsey comes out of two huge oak doors, walks past a gold "Belyeu and Crane" sign. She turns a corner. 
At the end of another short hall, she comes to the elevator, pushes the call button. As she waits, she looks out an adjacent window at the capital in the rain. She remembers something, looks down -- she has her purse but no umbrella. 
BITSEY Shit. 
She heads back toward Belyeu's office. 
As she turns the corner, she sees the older cowboy enter the Belyeu and Crane office. 
EXT. AUSTIN OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
Bitsey hurries umbrella-less through the rain to the rental car parked in the loading zone. 
INT. RENTAL CAR - DAY 
Bitsey opens the door. Zack's in the passenger seat. She doesn't bother to sit. 
BITSEY Did you see the cowboy go in? 
ZACK He went in Belyeu's building? 
BITSEY Into his office. Just saw him. 
ZACK Fuck! 
BITSEY Follow him. Find out who he is, where he lives -- what he -- 
ZACK How are you gonna get to Ellis? 
BITSEY A taxi. 
Zack makes a face. 
EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE - DAY 
A taxi makes its way through the hundreds of protesters and press that now gather along the drive. 
INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - DAY 
Bitsey, wet and hugging herself, paces in front of David. 
She's upset. 
DAVID Okay, okay. Calm down. You have to sit. 
Over the loudspeaker: 
GUARD (V.O.) Visitors need to stay seated. 
She sits. 
DAVID (to the microphone above) Sorry. (to Bitsey) Look at me. He's not your man. His name is Dusty Wright, DeathWatch Director before Constance. He's a 'bullhorner,' a zealot who thinks a good demonstration has to end in a riot and arrests. 'Almost martyrs don't mean shit.' They fired him. Constance kept him in the organization, and he loved her for it. The man adored her. 
BITSEY Then why was he following us? Why was he at Belyeu and Crane? 
DAVID He and Benny used to work A.C.L.U. cases together, until Dusty punched a clansman in a federal court. Benny sometimes still gives him work, probably had him follow you. 
BITSEY Why? 
A beat. David looks up at the microphone. 
CONSTANCE I'm sorry, David. 
She reaches over and puts her hand on his arm. 
CONSTANCE I guess I just wish I would have risked more. 
She has the bottle in her other hand, looks at it, takes a swig. 
CONSTANCE (making a face, swallowing hard) Uumm, also not enough sex. Should have had more sex. 
She puts the bottle down beside her chair. 
DAVID How much... how many lovers have you had? 
CONSTANCE Including college? 
DAVID Including college. 
Her hand (on his arm) holds up four fingers. 
DAVID Well, it's... not every... yeah, you should have had more sex. 
She laughs, coughs. He laughs. Their laughter trails off into the yard. He takes her hand in his. 
CONSTANCE You work hard not to be seen as a sex object. Before long, you're not seen at all. 
DAVID I see you. 
They are holding hands in the air, their elbows on the chairs' armrests. 
DAVID Want to make it five? Finish the hand? 
CONSTANCE A pity lay. No thanks. 
A beat. They watch their fingers lightly play with one another. 
DAVID It wouldn't be pity. 
They turn, their eyes meet, hold. 
INT. CONSTANCE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Constance and David are in bed making love. He's on top, one hand supports her head, the other strokes her face. 
They tenderly kiss. He starts moving, gently. 
DAVID Are you okay? 
CONSTANCE Don't worry. 
He kisses her neck. 
CONSTANCE It's good. 
Moves up to her ear. 
CONSTANCE Talk to me. Let me hear your voice. 
DAVID (in her ear) I'm here. Happy. I'm very happy. 
He kisses her mouth, moves against her in delicate rhythm. 
Her moans take on a teary edge. Their voices, breathless whispers, meld into one another. 
CONSTANCE Hold me tight. 
DAVID I'm here. 
CONSTANCE Tight... I'm scared. 
DAVID It's okay. 
She's begun to cry. 
DAVID Okay. 
He stops moving, kisses her tears. 
CONSTANCE Don't stop. Stay in me. Please stay in me. 
He moves again, slowly. 
DAVID Shhh. I'm staying. 
CONSTANCE I need to feel you inside. 
DAVID It's okay. I'm inside. I'm not pulling out. 
CONSTANCE I'm so tired. 
DAVID I know, I know. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
WHITE. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ELLIS VISITATION AREA - BITSEY AND DAVID - DAY 
ROTATING CAMERA. Bitsey's agitated. David's drained. 
BITSEY But there has to be someone. Someone with a motive, who knew you both. Someone who visited that morning. 
DAVID If I could answer... we wouldn't be having this conversation. It's why I need you, why I chose you. You have my story, now... (mimicking her delivery) 'Go.' 
BITSEY There's not enough time. 
The guard approaches. 
DAVID You'll find time. 
BITSEY You know that's not what I meant. You should have done this earlier. 
DAVID You're not here to save me. You're here to save my son's memory of his father -- that's all I want. 
A beat. 
BITSEY You're going to let them kill you. 
David moves to the back of the cage to be handcuffed. 
DAVID We live to stop death. Eating, inventing, loving, praying, fighting, killing -- choose a verb. All to stall this evil, Job's 'king of terrors.' But what do we really know about it? Nobody comes back. There's a point, when your mind out-lives its obsessions, when your habits survive your dreams, when your losses... You wonder, maybe death is a gift. All I know is that by this time tomorrow, I'll be better off. What I don't know is why. (exits the cage) Goodbye, Bitsey. 
The guard escorts him away. When he's out of earshot: 
BITSEY (softly) Goodbye, David. 
EXT. ELLIS UNIT DRIVE GUARDHOUSE - DAY 
A guard hangs up a phone and leans out the door. 
GUARD Car's on its way. Wanna wait in here? 
Bitsey stands in the rain. Behind her, hundreds of protesters flank the drive. 
BITSEY No thanks. 
She turns and walks toward the highway. 
The parade tape has been replaced with crowd barriers. 
The drive's left side now overflows with abolitionists: 
They cluster beneath tarps, some sing hymns, others paint signs ("Don't kill with my taxes!", "Mark 6:10," "Murder doesn't Stop Murder!"). Beneath one umbrella stands a large black woman holding a candle -- she watches Bitsey. 
The right side is a media circus. Various pro-death penalty activists also cluster here. They too have prepared signs: "Rape and Suffocate Him!", "Thank Jesus for Justice," "'Let's Do it'." A blackboard keeps a countdown: "13 hours." 
At the end of the drive, on the left, Bitsey sees a sign leaning against a camper: "Save David Gale." It catches rain; its letters run. 
INT. KETTLE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
The restaurant's crowded. A Church of Christ couple (50s) eat without comment. The man's T-shirt reads, "It's Simple: You Kill, You Get Killed." 
In the booth beside them sit Bitsey and Zack, their dinners largely untouched. Bitsey watches three sleazy JOURNALISTS at a table not far from theirs. 
JOURNALIST #1 I got it. I got it. You could have corporate sponsors. Volkswagen for Bundy, Home Depot for Gacy. And 'The David Gale Execution, brought to you by...' 
JOURNALIST #2 '...Hefty.' 
They find this hilarious. Bitsey looks away. 
BITSEY What time is it? 
ZACK (checking his watch) Nine hours, 52 minutes. 
A beat. 
EXT. MOTEL SIX PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Pouring rain. As Bitsey and Zack hurry toward their rooms, they see Belyeu getting out of his Cadillac. He carries Bitsey's umbrella and opens his own. 
BITSEY Belyeu! 
He turns, comes toward them. Bitsey holds a newspaper over her head, Zack slouches. 
BITSEY Did you have Dusty Wright follow us? 
BELYEU I employ Mr. Wright from time to time. 
BITSEY You could have said something. 
BELYEU (opening her umbrella) That would have defeated the purpose. Apologies if I caused you unnecessary anxiety, but I'm paid to be suspicious. (handing it to her) Thought I'd return this. 
ZACK What? 
BITSEY We're taking a tour. 
ZACK Where? 
She has the VCR. Grabs her purse on the way to the door. 
BITSEY Austin. Get the T.V. 
She opens the door, exits. 
INT. HOUSE 3307 ENTRY HALL - NIGHT 
The DOORBELL RINGS over BAUHAUS MUSIC. The Goth Girl, wearing only the Nine Inch Nails T-shirt, opens the door. 
Bitsey barrages past carrying the VCR, Zack follows with the TV. 
BITSEY Wanna make a hundred bucks? 
GOTH GIRL What do I gotta do? 
INT. HOUSE 3307 LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Bitsey, Zack and the Goth girl enter. 
BITSEY We're going over the crime scene. 
Bitsey checks the kitchen. The tripod's back. The other exhibit pieces haven't changed. 
BITSEY And for the next hour I want you to do exactly what I say when I say to do it. If I say suck Zack's dick, all I want to hear from you is 'May I swallow.' 
GOTH GIRL You want me to suck his dick? 
ZACK It's just a patriarchal figure of speech. 
BITSEY Is your boyfriend here? 
GOTH GIRL He ain't exactly my boyfriend anymore. 
BITSEY Well is his video camera here? 
GOTH GIRL Yeah. 
BITSEY Get it. 
She starts to leave, turns back. 
GOTH GIRL I gotta collect first. 
Bitsey, moaning, reaches for her purse. 
CLOSEUP - STEREO CLOCK 
reads 1:48. Zack's hand ENTERS the FRAME, turns the MUSIC DOWN. 
SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER 
Video: The Goth Girl's messy kitchen. Camera zooms in to a perspective similar to that on the Constance tape. The exhibit pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more-or- less where they were before. The Goth Girl enters the frame, she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter. 
ZACK (O.S.) Move those index cards, too. 
She picks up the index cards. 
Zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. The camera is on the tripod, connected to the Goth Girl's TV. Near it, the hotel TV/VCR. Bitsey cues the Constance tape to the beginning, freezes the image. Zack then checks the camera angle on the Goth Girl's TV. He moves the TVs so that they are side-by- side. 
BITSEY Zoom in a hair. 
He does so. Bitsey compares perspectives between the left TV (Goth Girl cleaning) to the right TV (Constance). 
BITSEY Put the gloves on a dish rack. 
GOTH GIRL I don't have one. 
Zack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter as an ersatz dish rack -- he drapes the kitchen gloves over them. 
BITSEY Turn them inside out. 
He does so. 
BITSEY Move the tape roll about a foot to the left. And get rid of the handcuffs. 
Zack repositions the tape. The Goth Girl picks up the handcuffs. 
BITSEY Come check this, Zack. (to the Goth Girl) Could you... what's your name? 
GOTH GIRL Nico's cool. 
BITSEY Nico, lie down on the floor, facing the counter. 
Zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the TVs. NICO sits on the floor, starts to take off her T-shirt. 
Zack runs to her, knocking the tripod over. He rips the bag open. She sucks air. 
ZACK (ripping at the tape) Jesus fucking Christ, Bitsey. You okay? What if I'd've waited? 
She tries to catch her breath. Nico releases the handcuffs. 
ZACK No more fucking experiments, all right? Just tell me what's going on. You okay? 
Bitsey nods, holds up her hand, wants to say something. 
She takes his arm, looks at him. 
BITSEY (still breathing heavily) She... she did it herself. 
SAME SCENE - MINUTES LATER 
Zack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking. 
Nico sits on one of its armrests. Bitsey, full of adrenaline, paces in front of them, thinking out loud. 
BITSEY She used the gloves to keep fingerprints off the tape and bag. Then she put them back on the dish rack, but upside down and inside out, a housewives' habit. A murderer would have just tossed them aside -- like they were the first time we were here, like you do a towel in a hotel. 
ZACK Maybe, all right, maybe. (indicating the cuffs) But why wear these? 
BITSEY They threw me. I forgot you have to have the key to put them on. But she needed them. She knew she would instinctively try to rip the bag off, that at some point automatism would kick in. 
NICO Fuckin' A, like when people hang themselves. At the last second they go chicken, claw at the rope and shit. The police find their own skin beneath their nails. 
BITSEY And she swallowed the key so she couldn't get to it. She made sure there was no way out. 
ZACK Woa, chill, chill. Why not hang yourself, or take pills. Why take your fucking clothes off? Why make it look like a murder? 
A beat. Bitsey contemplates. 
BITSEY It's so calculated. She's handcuffed, taped at the mouth. The gloves. The damn tripod. 
ZACK Why, Bitsey? Why fake your own murder? 
BITSEY I don't know. 
ZACK Motive's like a major issue here. 
BITSEY Thanks, Zack. 
ZACK It doesn't make sense. The woman's a bleeding-heart abolitionist. Why frame an innocent man? Why send Gale to the chair for what looks -- 
BITSEY What'd you say? 
ZACK She had to know some innocent fuck would take the fall. 
BITSEY Oh my God, Zack, that's it! That's why! To prove it happens. To have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents. 
ZACK Get the fuck out of here. 
BITSEY No, that's how she thought. She lived for DeathWatch. If she's gonna die, why not die for it? That's why the tripod was here. To record proof, undeniable proof, the tape. That's why we got an out-take. 
ZACK A dead woman put the tape in your room? 
BITSEY Of course not. She needed help, someone to keep it, release it. Someone she could trust, someone dedicated to the cause... 
They stare at each other a beat. The same thought: 
ZACK (mimicking Belyeu) Thick as thieves. 
INT. DUSTY WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT 
Dusty looks up at a wall clock: 4:23. He sits fully dressed in his living room, listening to an OPERA. He closes his eyes. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK OUT of his window and into: 
EXT. WOODS BESIDE WRIGHT'S CABIN - NIGHT 
Behind a couple of trees near the woods' edge, Bitsey and Zack hide watching him. 
ZACK Hairy. 
BITSEY Come on. 
She turns back into the woods. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT 
Bitsey and Zack emerge from the woods near the rental car. 
They walk and speak quickly in the light rain. 
BITSEY ...Because of the Berlin thing, Constance knew the police would go straight to Gale. In a way, he's perfect. A high profile alcoholic whose life was shit anyway. But... 
ZACK She was in love with him. 
BITSEY I don't know. Something. They were close. She wouldn't want him dead. 
Kruger stands beside her. A few people congratulate her. 
She attempts a smile and nods, though she doesn't look away from the TV. Kruger shushes the others to hear the story. 
ROBERTS (V.O.) The footage appears to show Constance Harraway commit suicide. 
ON TV 
ROBERTS (V.O.) Bloom reports she received the tape Friday morning at a motel in Huntsville, where she was staying while conducting Gale's last interview. 
ON FLOOR 
Zack watches Bitsey from the other side of the room. She looks over at him, then quickly looks back at the TV. 
ROBERTS (V.O.) The tape apparently had been in the possession of a former DeathWatch Director... 
ON TV 
Camera pulls back to reveal that Roberts is standing in front of Wright's cabin. Other journalists and gawkers can be seen out front. Police vehicles are also visible. 
Suits and officers move in and out of the cabin. 
ROBERTS (V.O.) (reading the name off a card) ...Dustin Emil Wright. As you can see, police and officials from the State Attorney's office have been in and out of his cabin all morning, looking for clues to his whereabouts. 
INT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT - DAY 
Belyeu enters a men's room. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
Belyeu walks to a row of sinks. He sets the case on the floor and starts to wash his hands. A businessman combs his hair to Belyeu's left. Belyeu looks in the mirror and sees Dusty approach from a stall. 
INT. NEWS MAGAZINE - EDITORIAL FLOOR - DAY 
The room watches Roberts. 
ROBERTS (V.O.) ...a fanatic in the movement to stop the death penalty. 
ON TV 
ROBERTS (V.O.) It appears Wright withheld the tape to make an obscure political point about the potential for error in capital cases. 
ON BITSEY 
She watches, trying to contain her emotions. 
Zack watches her. She looks his direction. He smiles sadly, looks away. 
INT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT - MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
Dusty washes his hands, looks down at the case. The businessman leaves. 
DUSTY All there? 
BELYEU Passport and ticket as well. 
INT. NEWS MAGAZINE - EDITORIAL FLOOR - ON TV - DAY 
Governor Hardin is on the steps of the capital, journalists around her. 
GOVERNOR HARDIN (V.O.) Well, it's a tragedy for all of us. As to whether this will change policy, the people of Texas will have to decide. Right now, the prudent course is to put things on hold pendin' a procedural review, allow ourselves time to mourn. 
Kruger leans toward Bitsey. 
KRUGER You bet she'll review. Capital punishment approval rates dropped 17 points. 
Bitsey just looks at the TV, trying to make it through. 
INT. DALLAS/FT. WORTH AIRPORT MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
Dusty picks up the case. Belyeu straightens his tie. 
BELYEU What are you going to do? 
DUSTY (walking past him) Go to the opera. 
INT. NEWS MAGAZINE - EDITORIAL FLOOR - ON TV - DAY 
Old footage of David being led in chains from an Austin jailhouse to a waiting van. He wears the clothes he was wearing the day Constance died. 
ROBERTS (V.O.) Of course, the ultimate irony is that David Gale, a man who became an unwitting martyr, may achieve in death what he worked for in life. 
ON BITSEY 
She bites her lower lip in a manner reminiscent of Constance.

THE WILD WILD WEST 
FADE IN: 
A1   EXT. ALFALFA FIELD - NIGHT                                    A1 
A slight breeze gently sways the green and purple crop. The CHIRP of CICADA is the only sound. 
SUPERIMPOSE:   1868 - ST. TAMMANY PARISH, LOUISIANA 
But suddenly the CHIRPING GETS LOUDER and LOUDER -- BZZZZZ! -- until we realize it's not the cicadas, but a -- 
SWOOOSH! A lethal, razor-sharp DISC BUZZES up over the horizon, swoops TOWARD the CAMERA and OUT OF FRAME! 
The CAMERA SPINS AROUND to see the disc flying away, chasing a man, THADDEUS MORTON, wearing a strange metallic collar -- exhausted, horrified, about to die. 
NEW ANGLE - MORTON 
He looks over his shoulder, panting -- he's been running forever. 
MORTON (mumbling) Madman... Hideous spider... Run... Run! Warn the President... 
Morton zig-zags through a grove of trees, a desperate attempt to avoid the horrible serrated disc. But the ruse is futile. The disc goes straight through the trees, slicing a path straight as the crow flies. 
NEW ANGLE - OLD WAGON 
dilapidated, broken down, weathering away in the field. Morton runs around the wagon -- but the DISC BUZZES straight through the sideboards! Wood shavings spit everywhere! There's no stopping this thing. 
NEW ANGLE - MORTON 
running for his life -- stops, turns. He turns, incomprehensibly mumbling, pleading for his life, cowering. 
MORTON Noooooooo!!!!!

And the DISC SWOOSHES TOWARD the CAMERA -- BZZZZZZZ! 
CUT TO: 
BLACK 
DISSOLVE TO: 
NIGHT SKY FULL OF STARS - LOW ANGLE 
A man leans INTO FRAME. This is GENERAL McGRATH.      And he's there to collect the silver death disc. 
McGRATH (to the unseen, dead Morton) And they says you scientists are supposed to be smart. 
1    EXT. DUSTY ROAD - LOW ANGLE - NIGHT                              1 
HOOVES THUNDER by. Then bouncing, skidding wagon wheels. Up on the empty buckboard is a pair of murderous ex-Rebs. As the Rebs pass a pint of whisky, lash the six-horse team on, PAN WITH the wagon to see it's headed for... 
2    EXT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                         2 
SALOON GIRL (O.S.) The legendary Captain James West and I finally got him all to myself. 
3    INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                         3 
WEST is bathing with the beatiful SALOON GIRL. 
WEST That's right, sugar, and you should feel free to treat him just bad. 
She moves in and kisses him, long and hard. West hears the CLATTER of the APPROACHING WAGONS. He stops the kiss and peeks out the knothole. 
4    EXT. WAREHOUSE - WEST'S POV THROUGH KNOTHOLE - NIGHT 
Down below, West sees the wagon with the Rebs. 
WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                            3. 
5   INT. WATER TOWER - NIGHT                                      5 
WEST (to himself) General McGrath's boys. I thought y'all was never gonna show up. 
SALOON GIRL Mister West, you wouldn't be here workin' tonight, now would you? 
WEST How 'bout some pants!? 
As she throws the rest of his clothes down in a heap... 
12   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT (SAME TIME)                            12 
General McGrath checks a pocket watch, looks up impatiently at the Indian, Hudson. His eyes drift upwards... to the balcony where... 
ANGLE ON UPSTAIRS BALCONY - TWO MORE EX-REBS 
have come up back stairs lugging a heavy steamer trunk. 
McGRATH I'm still waiting on my guns and ammo, but I see my men have brought your merchandise. 
McGrath subtly gestures with his eyes to the balcony for Hudson to confirm. Hudson nods. 
McGRATH I had expected to be delivering it personally to Mr... 
Hudson quickly cuts him off before he can say the name. The Indian speaks in a very precise King's English. 
HUDSON My employer, here in a brothel? (a small ironic smile) That would be quite... redundant. 
13   EXT. STREET - ON CARRIAGE - NIGHT                             13 
MOVE IN ON an elegant brougham driven by a very large, very striking woman in livery. 
As the carriage passes under the gas lamp, we can make out the top-hatted silhouette of McGrath's "employer," DR. ARLISS LOVELESS. Clustered around him inside the cab are three more beautiful women. As he strokes the cheek of the ORIENTAL one with the back of his hand like a cat... 
14   INT. FAT-CAN'S - McGRATH AND HUDSON - NIGHT                   14 
HUDSON You'll meet him when the time -- and place -- are appropriate. Now... (stands) ... shall we go upstairs to check the 'merchandise'? 
(CONTINUED) 
14   CONTINUED:                                                     14 
McGRATH Frankly, Mr. Hudson, I wasn't planning to walk those oaken stairs with you. Direct me to the poot, sir. Something young and creamy. A gamer that takes to the crop and spur. 
McGrath looks to the singer (Rita), who beats a hasty retreat from him after her song. So, once again, McGrath lays his rheumy eyes on... 
ANGLE ON SOILED DOVE 
She's oblivious, more intrigued by the ex-Rebs on the balcony with the trunk. As she starts for the stairs... a man's hand grabs her. It's the Eye-Crossed Reb again. 
EYE-CROSSED REB You drive a hard bargain, lady. All right, fifty cents to take them big juicy lips and... 
DORA Still not interested. 
She tries to pull away.    But the Reb won't let go. 
EYE-CROSSED REB But you gotta be interested. You're a whore. 
Suddenly the coquettishness in the eyes becomes rage. The falsetto becomes a baritone growl. 
DORA (baritone) That doesn't mean a girl can't have high standards. 
Just as the Reb registers the odd new voice... wham!    Her corsage springs out and whacks him right in the jaw.    The Reb's eyes roll back... and he slumps to the ground. 
Whooa, hoss... the Soiled Dove is a man! He's ARTEMUS GORDON and his true profession will be revealed to us shortly. But now, as he/she stashes the unconscious Reb behind the bar, straightens bosom and wig... 
15   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         15 
West is trying to get dressed. 
(CONTINUED) 
15   CONTINUED:                                                    15 
As he pulls on one leg of his pants, a guard lunges at him with a knife. West hops up on one leg, smacks the guy with a mule kick. 
Now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve. When the hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist -- which coldcocks the other guard. 
WEST Could I have a little privacy here? 
As if in response, the water tower, still hovering above, now crashes to the floor -- obliterating his opponents. 
WEST Thank you. 
He calmly looks up in time to catch the falling, naked, screaming Saloon Girl in his arms. 
WEST You'll have to excuse me, darlin'... but my evidence is getting away. 
West gallantly puts her down, jumps up, grabs the overhead block and tackle system and slides through the warehouse. As the HORSE TEAM, which has spooked, THUNDERS past... 
CLOSEUP - WEST 
sails onto the runaway wagon. As he pulls himself into the back, he gives the shivering Saloon Girl a tip of his hat -- now on his head. 
WEST Sorry about there not being any towels. 
16   INT. FAT-CAN'S - NIGHT (SAME TIME)                            16 
General McGrath   leers down a line-up of Fat-Can's girls. Just as he gets   to the beautiful singer, who looks sick at the thought,   suddenly Gordon intrudes. He/she blocks out the singer,   poses coquettishly -- sucking a lollypop. 
McGRATH What's your name, missy? 
(CONTINUED) 
16   CONTINUED:                                                       16 
GORDON/DORA (demurely; back to his falsetto) Dora. Would you like to go upstairs? 
McGRATH Oh, indeedy I would. 
leads the sweating, leering General down the hall. He/she quickly opens and closes boudoir doors -- ostensibly to find a free room for their assignation. The real agenda is to find the mysterious trunk. 
ANGLE ON DOORWAY #1 
Quick peek. He/she registers a mild reaction of shock. Closes that door and moves on to... 
ANGLE ON DOORWAY #2 
Quick peek. The two rebs sitting on the trunk. At their feet is a wriggling burlap sack. The "merchandise" is alive. 
Gordon/Dora giggles like a schoolgirl. 
GORDON/DORA Well, that's a new one. 
McGrath slams the door, drags Gordon/Dora roughly... 
24   INT. BOUDOIR - CONTINUOUS ACTION                              24 
Our soiled dove has her back to the door as if steeling herself for the task at hand. McGrath beckons her over to the bed. 
McGRATH Don't let the ear scare you.    I lost it at Chickamauga. 
Gordon/Dora squints at the jerry-rigged ear. 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:                                                         24 
GORDON/DORA Oh really. One can hardly notice... (fiddles with her belt buckle) Would you mind...? I... I... can't seem to release the clasp of my belt. 
Say no more. McGrath is on her like a flash, fidgeting with it. But it pops open, revealing a spiraling screen courtesy of Dr. Mesmer. His eyes lock onto it. 
McGRATH Wha... what's this? 
GORDON/DORA It's a deep, deep pool. Maybe your old swimmin' hole. Getting sleepy, General? 
McGRATH (ga-ga) Yes, I'm sleepy. 
McGrath sits on the floor.        Gordon smiles... this is gonna be easy. 
GORDON (normal voice) Good. You're going to be my little doggy. And when I say 'speak,' you tell me everything I want to know. Understood? 
McGRATH (barks) Woof! 
GORDON All right, little doggy. Sit up. (as he does) Now tell me who's in the sack next door. Is it the scientist, Dr. Escobar? Speak! 
McGRATH Woof!   Woof! 
GORDON Speak words, dumb doggy! Tell me the name of the man you kidnapped him for... 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               24 
But McGrath doesn't answer. Gordon's Mesmer spiral slows to a stop. McGrath is coming out of the trance. McGrath starts to growl, rip at his/her petticoats. 
GORDON Watch the swirling spiral!   Lie down, bad dog! 
As Gordon notices that his contraption's failed... 
25   OMITTED                                                         25 
26   INT. FAT-CAN'S - BOUDOIR - GORDON/DORA                          26 
is busy trying to get the spiral going again, doesn't see McGrath reach for his boot knife. Just as the deranged general's about to plunge it into Gordon/Dora... 
... the WINDOW EXPLODES. Jim West comes tumbling into the room, kicks the knife out of McGrath's hand in one smooth move. West rolls to his feet, fixes a gallant smile on Gordon/Dora. 
WEST Didn't mean to startle you, ma'am. Looked like you could use some help. 
It takes Gordon a moment to recover. He stares at this black Samaritan, obviously having no clue who he is. 
GORDON (clears throat to recover falsetto) Looks can be deceivin'... dark stranger. I am perfectly fine. 
West quickly pats McGrath down, removes a revolver and his bag of gold coins. 
WEST I can see that, darlin'. Woman of your caliber probably gets top dollar, too. So here you go. (flips her McGrath's coin bag) You can run along. I'll take care of McGrath. 
As West sticks the barrel of his gun in McGrath's gramophone ear, Gordon's eyes pop. 
(CONTINUED) 
26   CONTINUED:                                                    26 
GORDON/DORA No!   I need him! 
WEST C'mon, lady. You got the money. Have a little dignity. 
Gordon jerks West's gun hand away from McGrath's head just as the dog-soldier comes around. McGrath suddenly lunges at him. 
McGRATH (bellows ferociously) West...!!! 
He drives his full weight into Jim's back, pushing him out into... 
27   INT. FAT-CAN'S - UPSTAIRS HALL                                     27 
McGrath's rebel yell brings help from all directions. DOORS BANG open all along the hallway. Not just McGrath's men, but Hudson and his crew. A melee will ensue. 
West pushes the monster off of him, rolls as a BULLET SPLINTERS the WOOD where he just was. The SHOT STARTS... 
ANGLE - STAMPEDE OF SEMI-CLAD WHORES 
all screaming hysterically and heading for the exits. The beautiful young singer, who'd been coming up the stairs alone, is now swept back down them. 
34   INT. WHITE HOUSE - DAY                                           34 
West limps past black floor scrubbers. They stop working to marvel at this handsome black man dressed in custom cowboy duds walking in there like he owns the place. 
But not everybody's so impressed. As West heads toward the Oval Office, four self-important house detectives block his way. 
HOUSE DETECTIVE Whoa there, 'pardner.' (as West stops) Winning the war may have got you forty acres and a mule, but you can't just traipse into the President's office. Now gimme that gun. (CONTINUED) 
34   CONTINUED:                                                      34 
He nods at the six gun on West's hip. West coolly flexes his hand above it, like he's about to draw... 
WEST This gun? 
Then like lightning, with his other hand, he whips out a sawed-off shotgun hidden by his jacket. He pokes the 12-gauge barrels up against Pinkerton's surprised crotch. 
WEST Or this one? 
A voice stops the situation from escalating further. 
PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.) Gentlemen! 
The detective's head swivels around to see... 
ANGLE - OVAL OFFICE DOOR - PRESIDENT GRANT 
stands in the doorway. 
PRESIDENT GRANT Don't make Captain West any later for his appointment than he already is! 
The detectives back away from the hair-trigger cowboy as fast as they can. West reholsters the gun and continues... 
35   INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE                                  35 
President Grant goes over to his desk, lights a cigar. Backlit in the haze, the portly bearded figure lives up to the myth. 
PRESIDENT GRANT Been a lot of death threats lately ... Cabinet made me hire some damn detectives. (by way of apology) Drink, cigar? 
WEST Thank you, sir. 
West limps across the room to the bar, pours himself a glass of whiskey, takes a cigar out of the humidor. 
(CONTINUED) 
35   CONTINUED:                                                      35 
PRESIDENT GRANT I hear you let General McGrath get away? 
Now West's blood is up. 
WEST Sir, I had him right in my hands when some half-a-sissy wearin' a dress ruined... 
PRESIDENT GRANT (cuts him off) Artemus Gordon. 
WEST You... know him? 
PRESIDENT GRANT Of course I know him, he's the best marshal I've got! He's a genius. (off West's incredulous look) Gordon has proven himself time and again as a very cunning operator with a rapacious intellect. Nothing will stop him from completing a mission for his President... except the impulsive actions of a headstrong cowboy! 
West just looks at him soberly. Draws his gun and places it against the President's head. Grant's eyes widen. 
WEST Who are you? 
PRESIDENT GRANT I am the President of the United States! 
West points the GUN to the ceiling and pulls the trigger. BLAM!!! As Grant jumps a foot and plaster rains down... 
WEST Wrong answer.    Who are you? 
PRESIDENT GRANT I am the President of... (as West cocks gun) ... I'm Artemus Gordon. 
(CONTINUED) 
35   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               35 
West lowers his gun, nods at Gordon's class ring. 
WEST The President went to West Point ... not Harvard. 
PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.) Will somebody tell me what the hell this stunt is all about!?! 
36   INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE - SIDE DOORWAY -                 36 PRESIDENT GRANT - DAY 
(the real one) stands in the doorway, hands on hips, surrounded by his house detectives -- their guns drawn. West nudges the fake Grant in the fake belly with his gun barrel -- go ahead. Sheepishly, Gordon starts peeling off his primitive, but effective, facial prosthetics. 
GORDON Sir, in perilous times like these, I was simply illustrating how someone impersonating you could actually walk right into the very bowels of the White House... 
Just as Gordon makes his intestinal allusion, West takes a ceremonial bayonet off Grant's desk and pokes a hole in the inflated bladder that was his fake paunch. The AIR HISSES out, finishes deflating with a flatulent R-R-RIP. (Hey, the first whoopee cushion?) 
Gordon scowls at him. 
PRESIDENT GRANT You're clever, Gordon. One day it'll get you killed. 
West smirks as Grant looks up at the bullet hole in the ceiling, then fixes West with a disapproving eye. 
PRESIDENT GRANT ... And you, West -- not every situation calls for your patented approach of shoot first, shoot later, shoot again -- then when they're all dead, try to ask a question or two. (shakes his head) Working together will be good for both of you.

WEST AND GORDON But, sir, I work... 
39   EXT. C STREET TRAIN STATION - TRAIN ENGINE - DAY            39 
From in front, as it CHUGS TOWARDS us. Sitting up in the spanking new steam engine (No. 5) is a white-haired Coleman. The Wanderer is his pride and joy. Coleman pushes the throttle forward and the ENGINE ROARS PAST us... followed by a tender, and two gleaming passenger cars. 
Then comes West THUNDERING past in a desperate effort to catch up. 
(CONTINUED) 
39   CONTINUED:                                                      39 
ANGLE - WITH WEST 
riding like hell. Getting the last ounce of speed out of his well-lathered steed, he finally pulls alongside the rear passenger car. He looks up... In the window, we see Gordon engrossed in what he's doing... which appears to be sewing. 
WEST Stop this train!! You hear me!?! 
If Gordon hears him, he pretends not to.    He just casually makes the next stitch. 
West's horse has had it. They're losing ground to the train. At the last second, West leans over at full gallop and grabs a handle on the side of the train. He swings out of the saddle, hanging on for dear life, blowing in the breeze like laundry. 
Finally, his boot finds a small metal plate to put its weight on. Just as West stands safely on it... whoosh! He flies up in the air and drops through a sliding partition in the roof. 
40   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                                40 
The car is like a classy Victorian men's club. Bar stocked with crystal decanters, a pool table, decorative pistols on the wall, books, etc. Gordon, seated in a club chair, looks over as West falls from the ceiling into a seat. He's hot, dusty and very pissed off. He glowers at Gordon murderously. 
GORDON (calmly) Thanks for dropping in. 
WEST Forget the bikes, the beards, the fake boobies. Put down the needlepoint and let's settle this like men! 
He takes off jacket, starts rolling up his sleeves. Gordon remains remarkably cool, continues sewing. 
GORDON As a matter of clarification, this isn't needlepoint. This is. 
He shows him some real needlepoint. 
(CONTINUED) 
40   CONTINUED:                                                      40 
GORDON Right now, I'm putting the final touches on a new invention of my creation. I call it... The Impermeable. It's a vest that, when worn under the clothing, can stop any modern bullet fired even at close range. 
West draws his gun, aims it at Gordon's stomach and cocks the trigger. 
WEST Really? 
Gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach. 
GORDON But it hasn't been really tested empirically yet. 
WEST Get up! 
West takes off his guns and puts them on the table. 
GORDON (yawn, yawn) Guns. I find them so primitive and unnecessary... if one has done one's proper planning. 
WEST Yeah?   How do you feel about a fist? 
Gordon puts down The Impermeable, stands with a weary sigh. 
GORDON I must tell you, Mr. West, I've always felt that allowing a situation to degenerate into physical violence is a failure on my part. 
WEST Well then, 'Mr.' Gordon, you failed. 
Whap! West unleashes a lightning punch that drives Gordon across the train car. He dabs at his bloody lip. 
(CONTINUED) 
40   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              40 
GORDON I'm sorry, Mr. West, you brought this on yourself. 
Then to West's utter amazement, Gordon puts his hands together as if praying while at the same time, crooking his right leg stork-like. Is this some kind of martial art? Then, he bends at the waist, and like a ballet dancer, extends his leg out to the wall and flips a switch. 
It immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down from the ceiling. It whacks West on the side of the head, and sends him spinning back onto the pool table. 
ANGLE ON POOL TABLE - WEST 
shakes it off and is about to attack again. Gordon calmly pokes a hidden button. Suddenly the pool table revolves. West is gone. 
GORDON I love this train! 
41   EXT. UNDERNEATH WANDERER - DAY                                 41 
West, eyes wide, is clinging on for dear life, staring at the ties racing by, inches from his face. 
42   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - GORDON                            42 
Gordon pours a fine Bordeaux, speaks loudly toward floor. 
GORDON The President asked for my suggestions on how to make the Wanderer both comfortable and functional... 
As he swishes the wine in his mouth... 
43   EXT. UNDER WANDERER - DAY (SAME TIME)                          43 
West reaches up to get a handhold in the myriad of tubes and wires on the underside of the car. As he rips one tube out of the undercarriage... 
44   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - DAY                               44 
Gordon has just settled into the club chair, puts his wine down on the table. 
GORDON And while you're down there, you may want to avail yourself of my Sub-carriage Inter-rail Egressor... 
GORDON (V.O.) How about this? You could come as my man servant? 
49   INT. WANDERER - LAB CAR - NIGHT                              49 
Gordon has his wardrobe open. Selected from his vast array of costumes and disguises is a full livery outfit. 
GORDON How about this? You could come as my man servant. 
WEST (slave voice) Oh yes, Massa Gordon, dats what I'll do. And I'll jus' smile and do as I's tole so those people won' ever know that I would rather shoot myself in the head than play your god damned man servant! 
West is right in Gordon's face.

GORDON I have a horse costume. (then, cheery) You could be the head. 
WEST The only thing I need to wear is this. 
West straps on his holster. 
GORDON Okay, if you insist on carrying a firearm, I have something I think you'll find intriguing... 
Gordon displays a belt with a silver buckle. He taps the buckle... a Derringer pops out. West stares, impressed. 
GORDON And it would go nicely with this... 
Gordon takes out a sequined dress, holds the Derringer up against it. 
WEST Jim West does not wear a dress. 
GORDON Then what's your plan? 
WEST How 'bout this: I'll go as a government agent who's gonna kill McGrath. 
GORDON An armed, Negro cowboy costume, how creative. In a room full of white Southerners, you oughtta fit right in. You might even win first prize! 
West starts to walk away.    Gordon grabs him. 
GORDON Listen to me. The art of disguise is what's going to get us into that party, thus allowing us to find these kidnapped scientists before they're forced to create something that will destroy this great country. (MORE)

GORDON (CONT'D) Now you and I are the chosen ones, Jim. We're under direct orders from the President himself. And our mission is clear: Save our country. Our freedom is at stake and this is our duty as men. Now, you go as a riverboat captain and I'll be a saloon girl. 
WEST Let me tell you a little something about beloved 'art of disguise'... That night at Fat-Can's, I knew you weren't a woman. 
GORDON But I was propositioned by three men. 
WEST Gordon, you looked nasty. Your breasts were all hard and stiff, and were sticking straight out like two rusty cannons on a sunken ship. 
Gordon grabs his fake breasts off the rack.       He puts them on. 
GORDON These are a work of art. Scientifically and aesthetically perfect. 
WEST They look like shit. 
GORDON Touch them. 
WEST I don't wanna touch 'em.   I can see I don't like 'em. 
GORDON What, are you afraid you're wrong? Touch my breasts. 
West touches Gordon's fake breasts.

ANGLE - COLEMAN 
walking through the next car, carrying a tray of tea. Gordon's last line got his attention. What the...? Coleman peeks around the corner to see West eyeing Gordon's "chest." 
COLEMAN (to himself) I knew it. Well, I'll have no part of it! 
Coleman shakes his head and walks off. 
ANGLE - WEST AND GORDON 
West is thwapping Gordon's breasts. 
WEST There, Gordon, you happy? I'm touching your breasts. 
GORDON Not so rough.    The buckwheat'll come out. 
WEST Buckwheat?   That's your problem. 
West takes one of the cow udders out of Gordon's bodice and dumps the buckwheat onto the ground. 
GORDON What are you doing? 
West goes over to a wash basin, picks up a water pitcher and fills the cow bladder. West squeezes the cow bladder shut and holds it up to his chest. 
WEST Now, squeeze this. This is what a breast should feel like. 
WEST ... West.   Jim West. 
DRAGON LADY Well... West meets East. Mae Lee East. (holds out delicate hand) Are you here alone, Mr. West? 
WEST Actually I'm, uh trying to surprise an old friend -- General McGrath. Seen him around anywhere? 
MISS EAST (DRAGON LADY) I don't believe that name was on our guest list. And I would know. I'm Dr. Loveless's personal assistant. 
The name means something to West.

WEST Dr. Arliss Loveless...? One of the great founders of the Confederacy with Jefferson Davis. Funny how most people think he's dead. 
MISS EAST Tonight's his coming-out party. 
We FOLLOW them as she takes his arm and leads him down the stairs, into the party. 
55   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - DOWNSTAIRS - PARTY - NIGHT             55 
West surveys the crowd. 
MISS EAST See anybody that looks familiar? 
West scans the room.    Stops. 
WEST Matter of fact, I do. 
WEST'S POV - WOMAN WITH BIG HAIR 
She's got the mole, too.    Gordon has apparently encored his Soiled Dove get-up. 
Miss East sees who he's looking at. She makes a pouty face as there's a flourish from the STEREO QUARTET. 
MISS EAST I'm... jealous. (blows a little kiss at him) Meet me later... in the foyer. 
West watches as she joins... 
56   INT. LOVELESS MANSION - DOWNSTAIRS - PARTY - REST OF           56 LOVELESS' WOMEN - NIGHT 
Miss East leads them in a sober rendition of "The Battle Hymn of the Republic" in front of a large doorway.

From behind the doors we hear the WHIR of an ELEVATOR. It stops with a CLUNK. Suddenly... 
NEW ANGLE - DOORWAY 
bursts open and Abraham Lincoln in a mini-float appears. It's decked out like Lincoln's box at Ford's theater. On its own power, it moves past the laughing party-goers in the foyer. Now the women throw grapes on the floor. 
DISTAFF CORPS (singing) 'He has trampled down the vintage Where the grapes of wrath are stored!' 
WEST'S POV - ANGLE ON WHEELS OF WHEELCHAIR 
are what's trampling down the vintage. West takes in the whole man. Very curious. Then suddenly... KABOOM! 
ANGLE ON ABE'S HEAD 
It explodes like a pinata. Up from the hole in his neck peeps... DR. ARLISS LOVELESS. 
LOVELESS (impishly) Don't you just hate that song? 
The Southern crowd gasps at Loveless's dramatic appearance. 
LOVELESS Why, y'all look like you've seen a ghost! It's me, dear friends, alive and kicking! Well, alive, anyway... 
As he giggles, the distaff corps surround him and remove the Lincoln paraphernalia. Then step aside, revealing... 
NEW ANGLE - DR. LOVELESS 
is half a man. Literally. Cut off at the waist and mounted on a wheelchair platform that is powered by an engine, he is a man bereft of tuchus, kishkes and everything else in that vicinity that makes life interesting.

LOVELESS (chuckles) We may've lost the war, but heaven knows... we haven't lost our sense of humor! 
Dr. Loveless looks down at himself, smoothes half of his Fritz Lang Metropolis-style suit. His face turns dark as he surveys the crowd. 
LOVELESS Not even when we've lost a lung... a spleen... a bladder... two legs... thirty-five feet of small intestine and our ability to reproduce... (like a preacher) All in the name of the South... (then quietly) ... do we lose our sense of humor. 
You can hear a pin drop.    Loveless turns to the foreign dignitaries. 
LOVELESS I owe a deep debt of gratitude to my friends across the sea for their comfort and... succor. 
He suddenly seems distracted by the comely beauties that surround him. Then abruptly, manically... 
LOVELESS So...! Mi casa es su casa! Ma maison est a vous! Let the party begin!!! 
Loveless signals to the quartets to resume playing. Miss East leans down and whispers in his ear. Loveless looks in West's direction. 
Now Loveless wheels over to West. West isn't hiding. He's cocky in the face of rolling danger. 
LOVELESS Mr. West, how nice of you to join us tonight... and add color to these monochromatic proceedings. 
West keeps a lid on his temper.    Two can play at this game. 
WEST (still pissed, to Gordon) Hang'm!?! 
GORDON (to Rita) Meet my trigger-happy partner, James West... who doesn't seem to realize that my carefully planned diversion gave me the opportunity to search for the missing scientists. 
Now West notices the half-dressed bombshell in the carriage. 
WEST Scientist, huh. 
GORDON This is Rita. I found her locked in a cage in Loveless's bedroom. She's an entertainer. 
RITA Um, maybe I haven't been quite honest about that... My name is Rita Escobar. I came to find Guillermo Escobar, the scientist, my... father. 
Gordon's eyes pop. 
GORDON Professor Escobar?! He was the one I almost rescued that night when... (lightbulb) That's where I know you from! Fat-Can Candy's... you sang before I did. 
RITA Excuse me?

Gordon starts singing the song... West rolls his eyes, cuts off the chit-chat. 
WEST Look, Rita, I'm sorry you had the wrong agent working on your case. When I find your father I promise I'll send him back safely... 
And with that... West suddenly leaps over Rita -- lands on the back of one of the horses. He grabs a handful of mane, leans over and unclips the harness. And with a kick in the ribs, West is off at a gallop -- leaving Gordon, one remaining horse and an awed Rita behind to chew his dust. 
RITA He's impulsive, James. 
69   EXT. OFFSHORE - LOVELESS BOAT - NIGHT                           69 
Dr. Loveless and his visiting foreign dignitaries are sipping champagne. One of them is holding a little DOG in his arms, BARKING at something in the dark. General McGrath stands at the railing, uncharacteristically pensive. Loveless rolls over, hands him a glass of champagne. 
LOVELESS Well, General, it's been a long journey from New Liberty. 
McGrath visibly winces at the sound of it. 
McGRATH Sir, there isn't a day that passes that I don't contemplate it. 
LOVELESS Yes, and so do I. So do I. (reflexively reaches for missing legs) If I'd only had the scientific understanding of gunpowder and primers that I have today... 
(CONTINUED) 
69   CONTINUED:                                                  69 
McGRATH That's not what I meant. 
Loveless looks at him, puzzled, then gets it. 
LOVELESS Oh, you mean the stomach-churning carnage that earned you your unfortunate nom de guerre... 
Loveless speaks for the benefit of the others. 
LOVELESS What was that nickname again? 
McGRATH (reluctantly) 'Bloodbath' McGrath... the Butcher of New Liberty.' 
70   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - MARSH - NIGHT                       70 
A reb battalion waits in a foggy meadow that slopes down to marsh. Beyond that is the Gulf of Mexico. We recognize one of the REBS from the cathouse. He opens his pocket watch. 
REB #1 They oughta be here by now. 
REB #2 Maybe we're in the wrong place. 
REB #1 (rechecks map) No, we're supposed to wait 'xactly on this here spot. 
Suddenly they hear a CLANKING and SCREECHING coming from the marsh. They ready their arms and get in defensive positions. What they can't see through the fog is... 
ANGLE - MARSH - ARMORED TANK 
amphibiously sludges up through the mud and reeds, passing by the dumbstruck soldiers as it heads to the center of the field. The contraption has a large cannon and Gatling guns bristling from several ports. The Rebs cheer their new weapon. 
THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 7/1/98                         52. 
71   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT                    71 
Now a MORTAR appears through the turret and FIRES a ROCKET that EXPLODES over the Reb soldiers, illuminating the field. As soldiers shield their eyes from the blinding light... 
ANGLE - AERIAL SHOT - LOOKING DOWN ON FIELD 
Unbeknownst to the Rebs, Loveless has mowed and stained the field with concentric lines to give it a giant dart board appearance. 
Suddenly the TANK TURRET OPENS FIRE on them. Once over their initial shock, the Rebs FIRE BACK with their Springfield RIFLES. But the BULLETS PING off the tank's impenetrable skin like goober peas. 
72   EXT. OFFSHORE - LOVELESS BOAT - NIGHT                          72 
Lippenreider is viewing the carnage through large binoculars on a stand. 
General McGrath turns from the rail and faces Loveless, outraged. 
McGRATH Why you sawed-off sadistic bastard! You've betrayed us! 
Loveless turns to him, cocks his head. 
LOVELESS My dear General, after donating half my physical being creating a weapon capable of doing this... how did you and General Lee repay my loyalty? You surrendered at Appomattox! So, who betrayed whom? 
Loveless turns to Munitia holding a steno pad. 
GORDON It came up out of the lake... from the way these corpses are positioned, laid down a 360-degree pattern of cannon fire... then disappeared in moments. (puts a foot on a body, scratches his chin) My God, what kind of weapon is it? 
Rita can't handle Gordon's clinical posturing. 
RITA Excuse me, I think I'm going to be sick. 
As she walks quickly away, West comes over, a haunted look on his face. 
WEST It just rolls on and on. Makes a screeching sound -- like a wounded animal. Got a 'cabin' on top with a cannon... swivels 'round like an eagle's head. 
GORDON You saw it? 
WEST Heard about it. Thought it was crazy survivors' stories. 
GORDON What survivors? There aren't any here. 
WEST New Liberty, Illinois -- the free slave town just over the border. Just one week before the War ended in '65. I was in the 9th Cavalry that discovered it. Old men, women, children... they used them for target practice...

He looks out at the battlefield as if reliving it. Gordon is sympathetic to his obvious pain -- just shuts up. West's grim reverie is interrupted by MOANING coming from the shoreline. They all follow the sound to find...

General McGrath, washed up on the shore. West looks down at him. Now Rita, still looking green around the gills, rejoins the party. 
WEST That's when I vowed to follow McGrath to the end of the earth. 
As grey as four-day-old mullet, McGrath manages a smile for his relentless pursuer. 
McGRATH (barely audible) What's the matter, West? Thought you'd be happy to find me... like this. 
WEST I was hoping to kill you myself. 
RITA That's a nice way to talk to people. 
McGRATH You'll have to live with it... As I've lived with the blame for New Liberty. 
McGrath fades out.    West grabs him and shakes him. 
WEST What do you mean? 
McGRATH (opens eyes) It was Loveless... his plan. He operated the killing machine there. Smarter now... left it to others here. 
With the meaning of it all sinking in, West grabs McGrath by the collar and pulls him toward him. 
WEST Where is he?   Where did he go?!

RITA (O.S.) Well, I know that. 
West turns to her... well? 
RITA I'll tell you if you take me along.

They're yanked backwards into each other. 
SPLASH! They fall in the water -- back to back. Every time one rolls up and catches his breath, the other is under water.

GORDON The pinnacle of my life in the theater came in a production of Our American Cousin -- a light comedy -- at Ford's Theater in Washington.

143   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DAY                                  143 
Loveless is sitting in a captain's seat 60 feet in the air. He's surrounded by his adoring crew Amazonia, Munitia and Lippenreider. He spreads his arms wide, world at his feet. 
144   EXT. SPIDER CANYON RIM - ANGLE - GORDON AND WEST - DAY         144 
They watch the Tarantula head toward a narrow opening between two red-rock outcroppings. 
GORDON (dismissive) We'll see about that. The fool doesn't even realize he's trapped. 
145   EXT. MESAS NEAR SPIDER CANYON RIM - DAY                        145 
Suddenly... a VOLLEY OF CANNON FIRE EXPLODES the impediment to dust. The Tarantula marches on. 
146   OMITTED                                                        146 
148   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR (STOPPED) - DAY                     148 
West is dressing for battle. He straps his six guns on his hips, flips the pool table over, grabs a coach gun, tucks that behind his chaps. 
He belts on his shotgun shell bandolero. An extra six gun gets tucked in the belt. Another in his boot. Pocketfuls of shells. The man's ready for war. 
WEST Gordon, let's ride! (pause) You do know how to ride...? 
He sticks his head through the door to... 
149   INT. WANDERER - LAB CAR (STOPPED) - DAY                        149 
Gordon's Nitro-cycle is out.   Gordon fusses with it and some canvas. 
WEST ... A horse, I mean. 
GORDON (distracted) Yes... I know how to ride a horse. When the situation calls for something primitive. 
(CONTINUED) 
149   CONTINUED:                                                   149 
WEST How about now? There's a big spider stompin' towards our President! 
But Gordon won't be hurried. He has a big book out, studies it, then looks back to his Nitro-cycle. 
GORDON I was just thinking about another spider. Remember in the desert, when that little wasp killed the tarantula...? 
West rolls his eyes impatiently. 
WEST Yeah. Well, the wasp had a small advantage. It could fly. 
GORDON Exactly! 
Gordon excitedly shows the book to West. Pictured is an archaic sepia diagram of a weird aircraft. West looks at it in disbelief as Gordon prattles on manically. 
GORDON In 1540, Leonardo Da Vinci invented a flying machine called the 'Ornithopter.' Though he never actually flew it... 
West's heard enough.    He grabs Gordon, shakes him. 
WEST Artemus! There's no time for plans or half-cocked inventions! They don't work. We gotta stick to what we're each good at! 
As West drags Gordon to the wardrobe... 
150   EXT. DESERT (UTAH) - DAY                                     150 
Two riders galloping TOWARD CAMERA. As they THUNDER PAST, we see West is in the lead, jaw set. And right behind him comes... President Grant...?! (It's Artemus in disguise, of course. And he actually can ride a horse.) 
THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 6/15/98                       88. 
151   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - CLOSE ON GOLDEN SPIKE - DAY           151 
being held in the stubby fingers of Ulysses S. Grant. He's reading an inscription on it. 
PRESIDENT GRANT (O.S.) May God continue the unity of our country... 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a crowd present to watch President Grant knock in the famous spike. Behind him, two train engines are facing each other. The detectives scan the crowd for possible trouble. 
PRESIDENT GRANT ... as this railroad unites the two great oceans of this world. 
Now he swings back the sledgehammer... but at the top of his swing... 
CLOSE - SPIKE 
starts to shake, wiggle, and actually pop out of its hole. Very curious. As it begins to hop on the ground, bounced by a RESOUNDING THUMPING... 
ANGLE ON GRANT AND CROWD 
look across the desert to see... 
152   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - LONG SHOT - DAY                       152 
The Tarantula in full view. People start screaming in terror as it appears over a ridge, huge even at this distance. The metal beast closes the 200-yard distance in seconds. 
The citizens flee. The detectives are not far behind them. The soldiers take cover and ready their weapons. Grant stands his ground... even as a huge FOOT CLOMPS down in front of him, VIBRATING the CAMERA. 
153   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DAY                                 153 
Loveless talks into a microphone which BOOMS his voice out through AMPLIFIED SPEAKERS.

153   CONTINUED:                                                      153 
LOVELESS Well, isn't this a coincidence! I'm out for a little mornin' ride, and right in the middle of nowhere, I bump into General Ulysses S. Grant himself! (leans over edge, mocking salute) We've never been properly introduced. I'm Dr. Arliss Loveless, formerly with the Confederate Army.

Down below, nozzles on the Tarantula's legs suddenly ERUPT in clouds of skin-scalding STEAM. West screams in pain and falls... 30 feet... 
171    EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - DAY                                    171 
... to the ground, his head hitting a rock. As the two Grants witness it THROUGH the sticky spider ball... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
172    EXT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK                     172 
Loveless, wearing a black tunic festooned with medals and a Prussian-style helmet with a horse hair plume, raises his arms Nixon-like as a band plays a flourish. 
LOVELESS Bonjour, buenas tardes and good day! Great glorious day! A day of healing for the wrongs that have been done to us all! 
(CONTINUED) 
172   CONTINUED:                                                     172 
Framed by a large flag featuring the spider emblem, he looks out from center stage of a Greek theater at the crowd of foreign dignitaries seated around him. 
LOVELESS ... Oh, how long have we waited! 
ANGLE - AMAZONIA, MUNITIA AND LIPPENREIDER 
dressed in tight Fascist-brown tankwear, rise from their seats and applaud. The only people not applauding are a row of haggard, bearded scientists and the manacled prisoners Gordon (sans disguise), Rita, Grant and Coleman. 
LOVELESS (looks to Englishman) ... 1776, wasn't it, old bean? Most expensive cup o' tea in history...! 
As the Englishman dignitary nods soberly... 
173   EXT. PROMONTORY POINT - DUSK                                   173 
West's body hasn't moved. The only change is that now a line of ants crawls across his face. We watch, hoping for a twitch, something... But there is none. The ants march over lifeless eyes, swarm onto the bloody cut on his head. If we're not convinced he's dead... 
ANGLE - VULTURE 
circles lower, finally landing right by West's head.   As the hideous carrion-eater leans over West's face... 
EXTREME CLOSEUP - WEST'S EYES 
A shadow falls across them. But instead of the pecking red beak, a human hand appears IN the FRAME. Brushes the ants away. We hear an INDIAN INCANTATION over. Then finally... West's eyelids flutter open. 
WEST'S POV - NAVAJO SHAMAN 
standing over him. BLURRY, back-lit by the sun, the face of West's Indian friend. The healer who can turn himself into a bird. 
(CONTINUED) 
173   CONTINUED:                                                      173 
As West sits up groggily, feels his head. Hey, it's okay. As he makes a mental note to always be kind to animals... 
174   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK (SAME TIME)          174 
Loveless continues his speech to the foreign contingent. 
LOVELESS (looks to Hudson the indian) Manhattan for a handful of beads? (raises his hand; injun-style) How? (to the Mexicans) Remember the Alamo indeed! (humbly to crowd) Today I'm proud to be able to sit before you and tell you the wrongs will be righted... the past made present... the United, divided! 
To thunderous applause. Loveless signals for the flag to be pulled down, revealing... 
ANGLE ON MAP OF "THE DE-UNITED STATES" 
There have been some significant internal changes which Loveless now describes. The delegation from each country stands when they hear their name. 
LOVELESS Great Britain gets back the thirteen original colonies... minus Manhattan. (off applause) Florida and the Fountain of Youth go back to Spain! (off applause) Texas, New Mexico, California, Arizona revolve a Mexico! (off applause) And the Louisiana Purchase reverts back to the King of France! 
In the front row Rita leans over to Gordon. 
RITA Queen of Spain. King of France. I was close. 
(CONTINUED) 
174   CONTINUED:                                                      174 
MUNITIA (jostles her) Shut up and listen to a real genius! 
Finally Loveless taps Colorado, Kansas, Utah and Nevada -- now labelled as "Loveless Land." Smiles impishly. 
LOVELESS And a tiny piece for me to retire on. 
There's appreciative laughter. 
175   INT. WANDERER - PARLOR CAR - WEST - SAME TIME                   175 
stumbles in and looks around discouraged. 
The place has been ransacked. The gun cabinets are empty, the Gatling lamp removed. All that's left is Gordon's Nitro-cycle and his wardrobe full of dresses. 
West tries every secret hiding place. Nothing. Finally he finds Gordon's belt buckle/derringer. He opens the breech. Only one dinky bullet. He throws down the belt in disgust. 
176   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - LOVELESS - DUSK           176 
sits behind a desk that has been brought to center stage. Loveless unrolls a document, signs his half of it. 
LOVELESS My partner nations insist that we make this as legal as possible. Personally, I like the symmetry of it. After all wasn't it you who made us sign a surrender at Appomattox? 
Loveless snaps his fingers. Amazonia drags Grant out of his seat and sticks a pen in his manacled hands. 
PRESIDENT GRANT Never will I sign that paper, never will the United States ever surrender! 
An immediate standing ovation. The diversion allows Coleman to unlock both Grant's and Rita's shackles. Grant looks at the keys. 
PRESIDENT GRANT Where'd those come from...? 
COLEMAN (nods to Ebonia) Captain West. 
Their eyes practically pop out of their heads. 
RITA She's... no...! 
ANGLE - EBONIA/WEST 
One more time.

WEST (singing) 'Ha, ha, ha... Hang... Town... Girls!!!' 
Suddenly the tassels on his bosoms are spinning to the delight of the crowd. 
WEST (suddenly blinks) Wait a minute. What the hell is this? 
He stops, but his tassels are still spinning on their own. 
178   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - DUSK                      178 
Immediately two FLAME THROWERS EXPLODE from his cone-like bosoms. 
Maybe he should've listened about the dress. He turns to Gordon questioningly, and inadvertently incinerates one of Loveless's goons. He howls in pain, runs panicked... right into Rita. 
RITA Serves you right for staring at them. 
As she relieves the charred goon of his keys... Loveless turns to the rest of his goons. 
LOVELESS Kill him! (off their confused looks, points) Him! Him! The girl! 
Finally getting it, they rush Ebonia. Even his 4th of July breasts aren't a match for them. Desperate, West reaches way down in his undergarments to retrieve one of Gordon's billiard balls. He depresses the number and rolls it at the guards. 
GORDON Was that the eight ball? 
WEST Mmm-hmm. 
Gordon grabs West and Rita, pulls them behind the bar. 
(CONTINUED) 
THE WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 7/1/98                         101.

GORDON That one's an incendiary bomb. 
KA-BOOOOM! An EXPLOSION rips the place and a Santa Ana- sized fire starts immediately. 
Rita jumps up and makes her way through the smoke to a bearded SCIENTIST. 
WEST/GORDON Rita! 
She unlocks his neck collar, turns to them and smiles. 
RITA (disappearing into the chaos) Meet me after the show! 
Both West and Gordon look after her with yearning as three goons charge them. Coleman, amazed at their torpor, quickly grabs a RIFLE from the incinerated goon and OPENS FIRE. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! 
Three goons drop. Gordon and West exchange looks. Not bad for an emphysemic old engineer. 
COLEMAN Special Marshal... President thought you needed some lookin' after. 
Speaking of the President... he's grabbed a dead goon's RIFLE, and is LAYING DOWN a pretty good field of FIRE himself. Suddenly, he gets a tap on the shoulder from behind. It's Amazonia. Whap, she sends a right to his chin knocking him out. She throws him over her shoulder and carries him away. 
179   INT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - BEHIND STAGE -            179 DUSK 
As fire engulfs the place, Loveless has no choice but to retreat... for now. Surrounded by a cadre of his women, who carry the unconscious President Grant, Loveless heads through a round STEEL VAULT DOOR. As Amazonia swings the door closed, the foreign dignitaries BANG on the door begging for admittance. 
(CONTINUED) 
179    CONTINUED:                                                      179 
FRENCH MINISTER Monsieur, we are your partners! You can't let us die in this fire!! 
LOVELESS It's not the first time y'all have been burned in America. 
He chuckles, nods to Amazonia, who SLAMS the DOOR closed. 
180    EXT. LOVELESS'S LAIR - AMPHITHEATER - WEST, GORDON AND          180 COLEMAN - DUSK 
emerge from the smoking lair, coughing and gasping for breath. They watch helplessly as... 
181    EXT. AMPHITHEATER - TARANTULA - DUSK                            181 
CLAMBERS out of the bowl -- with Grant captive on the bridge. 
A182   EXT. AMPHITHEATER - DUSK                                        A182 
COLEMAN This is diabolical! They've got the President and I've still got that silly song in my head! 
GORDON (freaking out) C'mon we gotta go! We gotta ride horse! Something! 
West is watching the Tarantula, turns to calm him. 
WEST Shut up and go down there, will ya? 
West reaches up, shoves the make-shift joystick forward. As the wasp plummets toward the bridge of the Tarantula and Gordon strains to keep control... 
190   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  190 
Loveless and Grant are oblivious to our heroes above.    He unlocks one of Grant's handcuffs, presents him with a pen. 
LOVELESS Well, Mr. President. Have you had enough yet? Would you like to sign the surrender or shall we set a course for Denver? Wichita? Washington, perhaps? 
Suddenly there's a LOUD WHOOOSH and... 
191   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE SILVERADO -          191 DUSK 
West and Gordon swooping down low. West unfastens BOMBS from his vest, waits for the right moment. As they swing past the Tarantula cannon, he drops them. BOOM! BOOM! The big gun falls limp. 
192   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  192 
The dumbfounded Tarantula crew, which has been whittled down to Miss Lippenreider, Amazonia and Munitia. They never counted on having to shoot something in the air, and can't raise their weapons any higher than 90 degrees. 
193   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE SILVERADO -          193 DUSK 
West and Gordon banking around for another sortie. 
194   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  194 
Loveless wheels his chair amid the smoke and chaos, shocked. WARNING HORNS are GOING OFF. 
PRESIDENT GRANT Well, I'll be damned... it's West and Gordon... flying! 
Grant chuckles at the dauntless pair's pluck. 
PRESIDENT GRANT Keep that surrender handy. I think you're going to need it! 
LOVELESS Don't be too sure... 
Loveless thinks for a moment, pushes Grant out of the way, and rolls over to the controls. He pushes a lever and the Tarantula bends down on its knees. He barks to Munitia. 
LOVELESS I'm through with diplomacy... Take him away and kill him! 
195   EXT. DESERT - TARANTULA - DUSK                                  195 
On its front knees... 
196   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  196 
Now its rear end is tilted up in the air giving Amazonia at the Gatling gun a shot at... 
197   EXT. SKY - DESERT WASP (IN FLIGHT) - ABOVE SILVERADO -          197 DUSK 
The BULLETS PERFORATE the Desert's Wasp's wings and BLAST through its STRUTS. They're going down! 
WEST What does your boy da Vinci say about puttin' this bird down? 
GORDON I don't think he thought it would ever work, so he didn't get that far. I'm open to suggestions. 
(CONTINUED) 
197   CONTINUED:                                                      197 
WEST Take out as many bad guys out as you can. 
Gordon aims wasp at the Tarantula kamikaze-like just as... 
198   EXT. TARANTULA - LOWER DECK - MUNITIA - DUSK                    198 
Munitia cocks back the hammer of her pistol and aims it at the President... The WASP CRASHES into her. The SHOT GOES OFF wildly and Munitia falls off the deck, to her death. 
As Grant and the wasp hang over the edge... 
199   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  199 
Loveless at the controls.

200   EXT. TARANTULA - LOWER DECK - DUSK                              200 
West and Gordon, bruised but alive, climb off the wasp and onto the lower deck. They pick up the President and dust him off. 
GORDON Sorry about that, sir. Nose up, flaps down. Have to remember that next time. 
PRESIDENT GRANT Son, never apologize for saving a President's life. 
As Gordon realizes that he's finally made amends for that night long ago in Ford's Theater... 
AMAZONIA (O.S.) Soon you all can fly again. This time with little angel wings. 
West, Gordon and Grant turn to see Amazonia and Lippenreider with the drop on them. 
WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                             109. 
201   EXT. TARANTULA - BRIDGE - DUSK                                  201 
West, Gordon, and Grant are now under Loveless's control. 
LOVELESS Gentlemen, I am truly impressed by your effort and ingenuity. Why not swear an oath of loyalty to me... and forego your executions. 
WEST Why not? Well, I guess maybe I'd rather see what happens when I stuff your ass into that cannon up there and fertilize the landscape. 
GORDON Uh, Jim, I think a polite 'no' would suffice... 
Loveless taps a button on his chair and the floor opens up beneath West. He goes crashing down a story. 
Wrench Guy sneaks up on West from behind and swings at his head. West, on instinct, lifts the shovel and blocks the deadly blow at the last second. 
West has now found his rhythm... 
He swings and shovel and connects with... first, the foot, then the chin, and last but not least, the head -- BOINK! West drops the shovel and, World Wrestling Federation style, picks him up and hurls him into the space between the gears. We won't see him anymore! 
West pivots and WHACK!... Shovel Guy plants a neat little roundhouse kick squarely on West's jaw. West backs up and catches another in the stomach. Then... 
Shovel Guy really shows what he's made of... 
He does a series of jump-kicks, round-houses and fan- kicks into the air. All perfectly timed, all deadly. 
SHOVEL GUY I learned that from a Chinaman. 
West, without missing a beat, steps on the shovel, which flips into his hand and -- WHACK! -- lands a clean one right on the top of Shovel Guy's melon. 
WEST I just made that up.

Shovel Guy reels back and tumbles over the railing, through the hole and he's gone... 
WEST Don't forget your shovel! 
West casts the shovel out into the abyss. 
WEST (upward) Is that all you got for me, Loveless?! 
West, exhausted, turns and sees... 
METAL HEAD 
all seven feet of him. The top of his head is a metal plate. Extending downward, encircling his eyes. West soaks him in, sighs. 
WEST Uh, I just threw my shovel out. So this really isn't fair. If you don't mind, I'd like to... 
West, at lightning speed, throws a sucker-punch/spin- ning back-fist to Metal Head's jaw... PING! That one really hurt... West's hand, that is. Metal Head isn't fazed a bit. West throws another shot, this time to the gut... PING! Then a kick to the groin... PING!!! 
WEST (incredulous) Noooo. 
Metal Head has had enough. He effortlessly picks West up by his lapels and flings him across the room. West tumbles, and lands right next to... 
WRENCH 
He picks it up and starts swinging! A shot to the body ... PING! Then another... PING! Then another... PINGGGG! Metal Head lurches forward, absorbing each blow with not so much as a twitch of the eye. West furries... PING! PING! PING! PING!... nothing! He goes for the head... PINNNNNNGGGG!... nothing! West is out of time. He's been backed up as far as he can go. His heels are dangling over the mouth of the beast, a thousand feet above the rocky cliff. 
WEST Sorry.

Metal head grunts, grimaces and pitches forward, toward West, slowly but menacingly... West braces himself. 
METAL HEAD Urrrrrrrrrrggggghhh!!! 
West side-steps and Metal Head falls face first into the open air. 
WEST (downward) You guys just don't get out enough. 
CUT TO: 
202A   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                              202A 
West slowly gets up. Loveless is about to roll over him. He jumps up in the air, grabs onto an overhead strut, reverses and shoves the wheelchair off the ramp jamming the wheels. 
A smile comes to West's face as he watches Loveless's frustrated attempts at going forward and backward. 
WEST When you get right down to it, Loveless, you just can't beat a good pair of legs. 
LOVELESS (thin smile) You're obviously not a poker player, Mr. West... 
Loveless presses a button, the sound of MECHANICAL GEARS ENGAGING. Suddenly four metal legs appear from underneath the wheelchair, raising his body to a height of six foot ten. 
LOVELESS Two pair always beats a pair. 
West stares up at him slack-jawed. Loveless rolls up his sleeves, steps away from the wheelchair ready to fight. 
LOVELESS Now... Was it someone particularly close to you who perished in that military action? 
West responds with a roundhouse kick to the chin that makes Loveless spin around on the platform of his chair.

LOVELESS (stunned) Hmmm.   Well, that hit a nerve. 
Loveless imitates West by kicking with a lightning flash of an alloy leg. It's a rib cracker that sends West sprawling. 
LOVELESS A mother, perhaps? A father? 
CLOSE - WEST'S HAND 
He's just trying to get up when a cleated metal foot stomps down with hundreds of foot pounds per square inch. As West screams in pain... 
WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                            114.

Whimpering pathetically, he uncouples his body from the useless contraption and slowly backs up to his wheelchair that's stuck against the railing. 
LOVELESS Please, West... show a little mercy to a poor defenseless cripple... 
WEST (imitating his accent) Now, now, Doctor... let's not cloud this otherwise sunny day with that poor-ol'-me-cripple-talk. Just buck up and say to yourself, 'I am indefatigably hard-pumpin' and steely!' 
Loveless gets to his wheelchair and collapses in it. 
LOVELESS After I kill ya, I swear I'm gonna boil you down to axle grease! 
WEST Now that's the ol' doctor I know! 
But the smile fades from West's face when he sees Loveless's shotgun armrests pop out leveled at his waist. 
West has nowhere to go but up as he leaps to grab the I-beam over his head just as Loveless pulls the triggers on both BARRELS... BOOM! BOOM! 
The SHOTS almost blow the heels off West's boots. They PUNCTURE a PIPE behind him. Steam spews out. This is going to have an effect on something. 
210   EXT. TARANTULA BRIDGE - DUSK                                   210 
Gordon and Grant are trying different combinations to stop the thing. Finally, Gordon throws up his hands. He doesn't know what else to try when suddenly the Tarantula seizes up as if it just had a heart attack and tilts forward. 
211   EXT. CLIFF - EDGE - DUSK                                       211 
The Tarantula lurches forward drastically and teeter- totters on the brink. 
WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                             114A. 
212   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                             212 
The sudden stopping jerks Loveless' wheelchair free. Despite his frantic efforts, he's rolling toward the opposite railing. When the wheelchair hits a pool of hydraulic fluid on the deck, it spins him around 180 degrees. 
West jumps up, grabs a girder. The wheelchair spins under West's legs and then -- CLANK -- it slams into the railing and wedges there. 
213   EXT. CLIFF EDGE - DUSK                                         213 
The impact makes the mighty beast jerk forward, inches away from toppling over. 
214   INT. TARANTULA - BELOW DECK - DUSK                             214 
The jolt shoots West off the girder. He free-falls through the belly and out into the open air. Thinking quickly, he grabs onto the back of Loveless' wheel- chair. His arms nearly torn from their sockets. His weight causes the wheelchair to shift, now leaving it hanging on by a thread. West reaches out, grabs the wheel of the chair and hangs there. 
LOVELESS Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle. How did we arrive in this dark situation? 
WEST I don't know.    Guess I'm stumped! 
LOVELESS And I'm so cotton-pickin' afraid of heights. They just give me the spooks! 
WEST Ah, don't be afraid, Loveless. With this being the last leg of our journey and all, you should soak in the view, you're really missing something. 
LOVELESS Mister West, I'm gonna cut this conversation short... 
WEST Good one, Loveless.   I didn't think of that one.

LOVELESS (furious) Mister West!!! I am faced with a difficult decision here. On one hand, there is the overwhelming love that I have for myself, and on the other, the raw, seething hatred I have for you! Now, I could kill you very easily, just by pulling this lever... 
He moves the joystick.    The chair jerks back. 
LOVELESS But, of course, I would die along with you. I guess the only thing that I can take comfort in is the hope that you would hit those rocks a second before me and I could enjoy immeasurable bliss before I vanish. (moving joystick back and forth) What to do, what to do... 
West grabs the joystick. 
WEST Allow me to make that decision easy on you, Loveless. Because I want to see you dead a hell of a lot more than I want to live. 
LOVELESS Why is it that I have a sneaking suspicion, that although you are as black as the night on the outside... inside, you are yellow?! 
They lock eyes.    A beat. 
LOVELESS You don't have it in you, do you... boy?! 
WEST You were right. Let's cut this conversation short! 
West yanks the joystick back.

ANGLE - LOVELESS 
his eyes widen. The wheels spin for a second, finally catch, and in a flash, Loveless and West free-fall into space. 
LOVELESS Weeeeeeeeeest!!!! 
A beat, then... 
ANGLE - CHAIN 
which is dangling from the belly of the beast. At the bottom of the chain is the Knife Guy from the fight scene. West is hanging on to his ankles, enjoying a vindictive, belly laugh. 
WEST (downward) Now that looked like it hurt.

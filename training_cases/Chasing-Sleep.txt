INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Ed lies awake in bed.  He is sweaty and nervous.  His eyes are wide-open, blood-shot and tired. 
He picks up his bedside clock which is ticking loudly.  It is 3:37. 
He looks over at the other side of the queen-size bed. It is still made. He picks a long, blonde hair from the pillow and examines it curiously. 
There is a noise outside and Ed gets up to investigate. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Ed walks through the dark hallway and into the living room of his small house. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
By the front door, hanging on the wall, is a framed picture of Eve, Ed's wife. Ed passes by it and looks outside through the window. There is some wind outside, but nothing else. 
INT. BATHROOM 
Ed looks longingly at his reflection. Ed Saxon, 45, is a morbid, insecure man. His frustration with his life has tinged his sense of humor with an acerbic bite. His early success, a few publications of his poetry, has given him a professorship at the University. He is well-read, intelligent, a bit pompous and occasionally condescending. But mostly, these qualities are restrained and his outward appearance is a little sorrowful. There is an unquestionable charm about him, and its effect is evident in the people around him. 
He searches through the medicine cabinet, which is full of women's items, and takes out a Cosco-sized bottle of sleeping pills. He reads the back and takes two. 
He hears something bang against the front door. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
He opens the front door and takes a step outside. 
EXT. PORCH - NIGHT 
He looks down by his feet and finds the morning paper, wrapped in blue plastic, lying on the doormat. He picks it up and goes back inside. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Ed stands helplessly in the empty living room. 
Ed's desk sits on one side of the living room, crammed into the corner. He searches quickly through the stuff on the desk and finds a small address book. He finds a name in the book and dials the number. 
SUSIE 
(over phone) 
Hello? 
ED 
Susie.  Hi, it's Ed.  I'm sorry I woke you up. 
SUSIE 
Is something wrong? 
ED 
Eve isn't there, is she? 
SUSIE 
No.  She's not there? 
ED 
No.  She didn't come home after work. 
SUSIE 
Oh, no.  Didn't she call or anything? 
ED 
No.  She was supposed to be home around six.  I cooked her dinner. 
SUSIE 
Could she have gone anywhere else? 
ED 
I don't think so.  Do you? 
SUSIE 
I don't know. 
ED 
I'm a little worried. 
SUSIE 
I bet.  Did you call Harborview? 
ED 
No.  Do you think I should? 
SUSIE 
Yeah.  If she got into an accident of something, they would take her there. 
ED 
You don't think that's overreacting? 
SUSIE 
Don't be silly.  Just call them.  It can't hurt. 
ED 
Alright.  But if she comes home later and it turns out to be nothing, don't tell her I called the hospital, OK? 
SUSIE 
Call me back. 
ED 
Alright. 
He opens the fridge, looks around and takes the plate of food he made for his wife. He takes off the cellophane and starts to eat. 
He sits at the table, but after a few more bites, he loses his appetite. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Ed sits at his desk, staring at the phone.  He takes a breath and calls 911. 
OPERATOR 
911 emergency. 
ED 
Hi.  I don't think this is an emergency. 
OPERATOR 
What's the problem? 
ED 
My wife hasn't come home and, I don't know..I wanted to check with the police to see if there was an accident. 
OPERATOR 
When was the last time you saw her? 
ED 
This morning.  She was supposed to come home from work, but she didn't. 
OPERATOR 
When does she get off work? 
ED 
Around six.  Usually. 
OPERATOR 
She hasn't called since then? 
ED 
No. 
OPERATOR 
Do you have any idea where she might have gone?  Maybe to a friend's house? 
ED 
I don't think so.  I called the only place I could think of. 
OPERATOR 
But you were expecting her home. 
ED 
Yes.  I cooked dinner. 
OPERATOR 
I could send a police officer to your house. 
ED 
Do you think that's necessary?  Maybe I should wait. 
OPERATOR 
Until when?  It's five in the morning. 
ED 
Maybe she went somewhere. 
OPERATOR 
Where? 
ED 
I don't know.  Should I be worried? 
OPERATOR 
I would be. 
ED 
Yes, I'm worried. 
OPERATOR 
So, do you want me to send an officer to your house? 
ED 
I don't think so.  I think I should wait. 
OPERATOR 
Do you think she's going to come home soon? 
ED 
I hope so. 
OPERATOR 
So do I.  How long are you going to wait? 
ED 
A little longer.  I think I may be overreacting.  She might have gone somewhere I can't think of.  Sometimes I worry too much. 
OPERATOR 
When she left for work this morning.  She was supposed to come home after work.  I cooked dinner. 
STEWART 
And she made it to work, right? 
ED 
Yes.  I think so.  I don't know. 
STEWART 
What time does she usually come home?  Around six? 
ED 
Yes.  Usually. 
STEWART 
What does she look like? 
ED 
She's blonde, straight hair. 
STEWART 
What was she wearing?  Do you remember? 
ED 
I think it was a red sweater and a dress. 
STEWART 
What kind of car does she drive? 
ED 
A Volvo.  Gray.  '85, I think. 
Stewart lets out a sigh of relief. 
STEWART 
Well, you had me worried. There was a blonde woman involved with a car-jacking around six. Apparently she was hit on the head by one of the perpetrators and then wandered away from the incident in a daze. Nobody's seen her since. When I got the call on the radio, I thought that must have been your wife, but this woman was driving a Pathfinder and was wearing jeans, so it probably wasn't her. You had me worried. 
ED 
She drove a Volvo.  Drives a Volvo. 
STEWART 
That's a relief.  Do you know anywhere your wife might have gone? 
ED 
I called the only place I could think of.  And I called the hospital. 
STEWART 
Harborview? 
ED 
Yes. 
Stewart takes a couple of pills from a bottle and takes them, chasing them down with a coffee he has with him. 
STEWART 
I'm afraid there's not much I can do now. By law, we can't put out a missing persons until 72 hours has elapsed since the last time she was seen. 
ED 
72 hours? 
STEWART 
Usually in these cases, it was something stupid. Maybe she was upset about something, had to get away. Who knows? What I can do is take the license plate number of her car and if it shows up for some reason, we'll give you a call. Do you have your wife's license plate number? 
ED 
Yes.  Actually, it's easy to remember.  007 FEC. 
STEWART 
James Bond. 
ED 
Right.  And FEC, For Every Child. 
STEWART 
And what's her name? 
ED 
Eve.  Eve Saxon. 
STEWART 
And your name? 
ED 
Ed.  Saxon. 
STEWART 
Like I said, it was probably something stupid.  Did you have a fight? 
ED 
Not at all. 
STEWART 
Well, you should try to get some sleep and, if she doesn't show up tomorrow, give us a call and we'll see what things look like then. OK? 
ED 
Certainly. 
Ed heads into - 
INT. EVE'S ROOM 
- and picks up the small address book from the desk. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
He hands the address book and takes a picture of Eve from his desk, removing from the frame. 
DERM 
Great. 
Derm flips through the address book and a business card falls out.  Derm picks it up and looks it over. 
DERM 
George Simian.  Is that the same George that called? 
ED 
Yes. 
DERM 
This address, this George Simian lives on Capitol Hill, where we found your wife's car. 
ED 
Really? 
DERM 
May I borrow this? 
ED 
I suppose. 
DERM 
I'll call the numbers in here and see what I can turn up.  Try no to worry, Mr Saxon.  I'll be in touch. 
ED 
Yes, thank you. 
Derm leaves.  Ed shuts the door and locks it. 
The phone rings and Ed picks it up. 
ED 
Hello. 
SADIE 
(over phone) 
He, Mr Saxon? 
ED 
Yes? 
SADIE 
Hi, it's Sadie Crumb, from your creative writing class. 
ED 
Oh, yes.  Hi. 
SADIE 
Are you OK?  Is this a bad time to call? 
ED 
No.  It's alright. 
SADIE 
I was, I don't know, wondering if you were sick or something, when you didn't come to class. 
ED 
No, well, a little. 
SADIE 
Do you need anything?  I mean, I could bring you something. 
ED 
No, I don't think so. 
SADIE 
Really, it's no problem.  Have you eaten? 
ED 
No, but... 
SADIE 
I can bring you something to eat.  It's no problem.  Some soup or something. 
ED 
Really, I don't know if it's a good idea. 
SADIE 
Oh, I'm sorry. 
SADIE 
It's almost eight. 
ED 
Oh.  I seem to be having a little trouble with time. 
SADIE 
I know what you mean.  I'm one of those people who is always late. 
ED 
Come in. 
SADIE 
I hope you don't mind me coming over like this. It didn't occur to me that it might be a little strange until after I hung up. It's just, well, at my high school, I went to boarding school, and we were pretty close with our teachers. 
ED 
It's nice.  Kindness.  Very refreshing. 
SADIE 
I brought you some soup. 
ED 
I better get some clothes on.  Make yourself at home. 
SADIE 
OK. 
INT. BEDROOM 
Ed gets dressed. As he does, he notices a pile of Eve's clothes on the floor. He picks them up and puts them in the closet, on top of a pile of Eve's dirty laundry. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
When Ed comes out, Sadie has put the soup in a bowl and set a place at the table. 
SADIE 
I put it in a bowl for you.  I hope you don't mind. 
ED 
Thank you. 
Ed sits down and tastes the soup. 
ED 
It's good. 
SADIE 
I got it at my favorite place.  You don't mind me hanging out for a little while, do you? 
ED 
No.  I could use the company.  Like I said, I haven't been feeling very well. 
Sadie notices the pile of papers on Ed's desk. 
SADIE 
Oh, you graded our papers. 
ED 
Some of them. 
SADIE 
Can I look? 
ED 
Sure. 
Sadie looks through the papers.  She finds hers marked with a C minus. 
SADIE 
Oh. 
ED 
What is it? 
SADIE 
I just...I guess I though this one was better. 
ED 
Let me see. 
Ed looks over the paper for a second.  He takes a pen and crosses out the C and changes it to an A. 
ED 
I was in a bad mood when I graded these. 
SADIE 
Don't change it if it's not good. 
ED 
It's just a grade. 
SADIE 
Please don't.  No.  Don't.  Please. 
Sadie takes the paper away from him. 
ED 
Maybe it's because you were fucking her. 
GEORGE 
You son of a bitch.  What did you do?  If you hurt her, I swear, I'm going to kill you. 
ED 
Look, she disappeared.  I haven't seen her.  Why do you think I called the police? 
GEORGE 
I'll kill you.  I'll kill you, you bastard.  I swear. 
Ed hangs up. He is shaky, but also strangely exhilarated. He turns off the ringer on the phone and turns down the volume on the answering machine. 
INT. KITCHEN 
He brings the rest of the soup to the sink, scrapes it into the garbage disposal, and flicks the switch. When the food has gone down, he starts to wash the dishes. He stops and looks back to the bathroom. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Ed walks over to the bathroom door. 
ED 
Sadie? 
There is no answer.  He knocks on the door. 
ED 
Sadie?  Is everything alright? 
There is still no answer. 
ED 
I'm coming in.  OK? 
INT. BATHROOM 
Ed opens the door. Sadie is lying on the floor, passed out. Her pants are around her knees, as if she passed out while standing up from the toilet. 
Her nose is bleeding, like she might have hit it on the way down.  It has bled on her sweater. 
The air from the open door wakes her up, but she is in a heavy daze. 
ED 
Are you alright?  My God.  What happened? 
Ed comes over to her and lifts her head.  She stares at him strangely. 
ED 
Can you stand?  Do you understand me?  I'll help you to the bedroom. 
Sadie notices her pants are down. 
SADIE 
Oh. 
ED 
I'll wait outside. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Ed waits outside and, a second later, Sadie comes out, still reeling, clutching her purse. She leans on Ed, who leads her into the bedroom. 
INT. BEDROOM 
Sadie lies down on the bed. 
ED 
You want some water. 
SADIE 
Yes, please. 
Ed goes into the - 
INT. KITCHEN 
He takes a glass from the cupboard and fills it up. He stops, having noticed something on the glass. He holds the glass up to the light. 
Eve's lipstick is clearly marked on the rim. 
He puts that glass down and fills another. 
INT. BEDROOM 
When he comes back, he finds Sadie digging through her purse.  She pulls out an asthma inhaler and takes a couple of big hits. 
Then she sits on the bed and drinks a little water. 
SADIE 
I'm so embarrassed. 
ED 
No, don't be. 
SADIE 
God, my nose. 
ED 
Does it hurt? 
SADIE 
No, but the blood. 
Cancer.  It was quite an ordeal.  She died very slowly. 
SADIE 
That's so sad.  I better go, huh? 
ED 
It's getting late. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Ed walks her to the door. 
SADIE 
I'm sorry about everything. 
ED 
Don't be sorry.  I'm glad you came. 
SADIE 
I'll see you tomorrow. 
ED 
Tomorrow? 
SADIE 
In school.  You'll be there, right? 
ED 
Oh, yes.  I'll be there. 
SADIE 
Bye. 
Sadie kisses him on the cheek and then leaves. 
Ed locks the door after her. 
INT. BATHROOM 
Ed looks at the tub in the bathroom which is full of water. 
He sticks his finger deep into the drain, trying to free whatever is in there. There is another tuft of hair, and again he throws it into the toilet. 
The gurgling sound that he heard before has come back, resonating through the soapy water from the drain. 
INT. BASEMENT 
Ed follows the gurgling sounds into the basement. 
He takes a flashlight from behind the basement door and shines it at the pipes that lead from the bathtub drain. He can hear the gurgling sound running through them. It sound like they ate something they can't digest. He reaches up and touches the pipe. It seems to be leaking a little, or maybe it is condensation. 
Ed traces the noise to a larger sewage pipe that runs down into the basement floor. He watches the pipe, but slowly, his attention is drawn to the shadow next to the pipe. 
As he stares intently into the darkness of the shadow, a figure begins to emerge in the distance. The darkness begins to change into a long hallway. A small figure is walking towards Ed and his footsteps echo in the distance. 
Ed watches, mesmerized. 
The basement fades into the blackness, and now, the hallway becomes more clear. 
INT. HOSPITAL 
It is a very long hospital hallway, and the figure walking toward Ed is a doctor, carrying a clipboard. 
DOCTOR 
Mr Saxon. 
ED 
Yes. 
DOCTOR 
There's nothing we can do for her now except to alleviate any pain she may be feeling. We have her on a morphine drip and we'll keep increasing the dosage as she shows any signs of pain. 
ED 
I see.  Can she understand me? 
DOCTOR 
At this point, probably not. She has so much morphine in her, I doubt she can even recognize you. But you never know. Actually, in cases like this, where the end is inevitable, I recommend that we increase the dosage on the morphine drip at an accelerated rate. There's no point in making this last longer than it has to. 
ED 
Whatever you think is best. 
The doctor nods, then walks into the hospital room where, we see now, Ed's MOTHER is lying in a hospital bed, hooked up to a digital IV. She is old, but looks older - she's been through chemotherapy and radiation and they have all taken their toll. 
She stares at Ed with confused and desperate eyes.  It is hard to tell if she is looking at him or not. 
The doctor, at the door, has a few words with the NURSE, who then looks into the room. 
Ed sits next to his mother and takes her hand.  She stares at him. 
The nurse comes in and pushes a button on the digital IV. Ed watches the LED numbers on the digital IV go up. The nurse smiles an attempt at comfort, then leaves the room. 
Mother reacts to the higher dosage of morphine. Her eyes get wider and more delirious. She sits up a little and tenses her muscles. She lets go of Ed's hand and starts moving her arm up and down. 
She starts shouting something.  At first, it is completely unintelligible, but slowly, it becomes clearer. 
MOTHER 
IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HELL! IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HELL! IT MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO HELL! 
Ed stands up and backs away.  He backs out of the hospital room as his mother continues to scream. 
Ed backs into the hallway, which is now blackness. 
As he backs away, another noise starts to echo around him.  A banging.  A loud banging is coming from upstairs. 
Ed backs away and then runs upstairs. 
ED 
Yes. 
DERM 
I've been trying to call you. 
ED 
You found her. 
DERM 
No.  I need to talk to you. 
ED 
Detective.  George Simian was just over here.  He hit me. 
DERM 
Are you OK? 
ED 
I think so. 
DERM 
Do you want me to call an ambulance? 
ED 
I don't need an ambulance. 
DERM 
I'll be right over. 
ED 
OK. 
He hangs up the phone. 
He sits at the desk, resting the ice on his forehead. 
Then he notices something under the sofa.  It grabs his attention.  He gets up for a closer look. 
There are dust bunnies and dust under the edge of the sofa, like it hasn't been swept for a while. Ed kneels down and tries to peer under the sofa. It is dark underneath and he can't see anything. 
He reaches his fingers under and sweeps out a few dust bunnies. 
Then he reaches a little further under the sofa and sweeps out Eve's pinkie finger. 
He recoils at the sight of this. The finger has been neatly cut, as if by a sharp blade. Dust has clung to the clotted blood around the stump, but it is unquestionably a woman's pinkie finger. 
He stares at it for a second, curiously disgusted. 
He goes to pick it up, decides he doesn't want to touch it, then uses a tissue to pick it up. 
He hurries to the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM 
He drops the finger into the toilet with the tissue and flushes it. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
He hurries to the edge of the couch with a sponge and cleans up the small amount of blood and dust left there. 
INT. KITCHEN 
He squeezes the sponge out until it is clean, then puts it aside. 
He lets out a huge sigh of relief. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Much of the ice has melted and the towel it was wrapped in is now soaking wet. 
INT. BATHROOM 
He takes the towel into the bathroom and rings it out. 
Then he looks over at the toilet. The finger is still there, floating like a cigarette butt. The water is pink from the blood, the tissue is gone, but the finger floats there defiantly. 
He flushes the toilet again, but this time stays to watch.  The water goes down, but the finger stays buoyant and won't go down. 
There is a knock on the front door. 
Ed takes a bunch of toilet paper from the roll and tosses it over the finger. He flushes again, but the tank hasn't filled up yet and, if anything, this makes it longer until it will fill up again. 
There is another impatient knock at the door. 
ED 
One second! 
Ed sits there waiting, listening to the toilet tank filling. 
The knocking outside is becoming more impatient. 
The tank finally fills. Ed flushes and watches. This time the paper he threw in clogs the toilet and the bowl quickly fills up with water. 
Ed reaches behind the toilet and turns off the water, stopping it from overflowing. 
He looks in the toilet and can't see the finger through the mess of toilet paper. 
There is another knock on the door. 
Ed closes the toilet lid. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Ed shuts the bathroom door firmly, takes a breath, and hurries out to meet Derm. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Ed answers the door.  Derm comes in with two assistants, MAZUREK and SNYDER.  Snyder is holding Ed's morning paper. 
The P.E. teacher.  I guess I should have known. 
DERM 
Apparently your wife has been seeing him for some time.  Almost a year, in fact. 
ED 
A year? 
DERM 
Do you consider that you and your wife have a normal relationship? 
ED 
I don't know. Normal relationship. We get on each other's nerves, have sex a few times a year, order pizza on Fridays. We've been married for ten years. It doesn't stay rosy forever. Maybe it isn't paradise, but that doesn't mean that I don't love her. 
DERM 
Are you having any other relationships? 
ED 
No. 
DERM 
Does your wife keep a diary? 
ED 
No.  She isn't the type. 
DERM 
Mr Saxon.  May I be frank? 
ED 
Yes.  Please. 
DERM 
Cases involving missing persons are not uncommon. In many cases, and that is not to say in every case, but in many cases, the results are unfortunate. 
ED 
My God. 
DERM 
I'm not saying that you should give up hope, but my experience tells me that you should prepare yourself for the worst. Now, having said that, we will do everything in our power to find your wife. 
ED 
I understand. 
DERM 
Now, it's best if we can gather as much information as possible, as quickly as possible. I'm sure you understand the urgency here. 
ED 
Of course. 
DERM 
It will be necessary for us to search through some of your wife's personal items. 
ED 
I'm sure I can find whatever it is that you want. 
DERM 
It's really in your wife's best interests if you allow us to do it. We won't disturb anything or touch anything without your permission. 
ED 
Alright. 
DERM 
How about we start in the bedroom? 
ED 
The bedroom. 
DERM 
Yes. 
ED 
Right.  I'll show you. 
Ed stands up and leads them into the bedroom. 
INT. HALLWAY 
They pass by the bathroom. The gurgling noises from the plumbing echo around the hallway, and while the police don't seem to pay it any mind, Ed can definitely hear it. 
INT. BEDROOM 
Ed looks around the bedroom quickly before they go in. 
ED 
Here you go.  It's sort of a mess. 
DERM 
Do you know where your wife keeps her credit card receipts? 
ED 
Yes.  Sure.  This way. 
Ed leads Derm to Eve's room, leaving the two assistants in the bedroom. 
DERM 
In cases like this, when we don't have many substantial leads, getting a picture of your wife on TV can be invaluably helpful. 
ED 
I don't know if I'm comfortable with that. 
DERM 
We still have options left, but without a thorough search of your wife's belongings, those options are extremely limited. 
ED 
I want to be helpful, but I really don't see how, if you think she was kidnapped, I don't see how it helps you to search around our things. 
DERM 
We don't know that she was kidnapped. We can't draw those kinds of conclusions. She could have simply decided that she needed some time alone. We have to consider every possibility. 
ED 
I just don't see how it helps. 
DERM 
I don't want to argue with you.  We're trying to help you.  This is our job. 
ED 
I understand. 
DERM 
It is in the best interest of your wife that you let us do that job without impediment. 
ED 
I don't want to get in the way. I just would like some time alone. You can comes back tomorrow, but, please. I'm very tired. I know it might seem irrational, but I haven't slept in a long time and this is all extremely overwhelming. Please. I need to be alone. 
DERM 
Certainly.  If I could just take those receipts. 
ED 
Sure.  Here.  Take them all. 
The receipts are on the desk in front of him and he hands them to Derm. 
Derm reaches out for the diary. 
ED 
I'd like to keep this. 
DERM 
There are some things it may be better not to know, especially if your wife comes back. 
ED 
I can give it to you tomorrow, if you still want it. 
Ed leaves the diary on Eve's writing table and walks the officers out. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
DERM 
Mr Saxon.  Is there something wrong with your answering machine? 
ED 
Yes.  It broke when I fell on it. 
DERM 
You haven't been answering your phone. 
ED 
It hasn't rung. 
Derm looks at the phone and sees the ringer is turned off. 
DERM 
The ringer is off. 
ED 
Oh.  I must have turned it off. 
DERM 
What if your wife calls? 
DERM 
Yes.  Of course.  I wasn't thinking. 
DERM 
Could you please leave the phone on from now on? 
ED 
Yes.  I thought I was.  OK.  Thank you. 
DERM 
I'll be calling to let you know how things go with Mr Simian. 
ED 
Yes.  Thank you. 
Derm and the officers leave. 
Ed lets out a sigh of relief.  He touches his forehead and it obviously hurts. 
MRS MASTRIONI 
Does this mean that you won't be coming to class tomorrow? 
ED 
Fuck you! 
Ed slams the phone down. 
INT. BATHROOM 
Ed takes the bottle of Midol from the medicine cabinet and takes a few more. 
Then he notices a trail of pink water leading from the toilet, along the bathroom floor and into the hallway. 
He follows the trail. 
INT. HALLWAY 
The trail leads up to the pinkie finger. Ed watches while the finger moves, inchworm-like, across the floor, toward Eve's room, leaving a wet trail behind it. 
Ed watches for a second while he decides what to do. 
He quickly grabs the finger and takes it to the kitchen sink. He drops it in the sink, pushes it down the drain and flicks the garbage disposal on. He turns the water on and leaves it running until it sounds like there is nothing left of the finger. 
When he turns it off, he sticks his hand in, searching for any remnants of the finger.  It appears to have gone down. 
He takes the sponge and wets it. 
INT. HALLWAY 
He wipes up the trail of the finger, following it back into the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM 
He looks at the toilet, which is still stuffed up. 
INT. BASEMENT 
Ed searches around the basement for a plunger.  The basement is full of strange sounds, all ruminating from the exposed pipes. 
He finds a plunger among some other tools and starts back upstairs, but on his way upstairs, he finds that there is a puddle of water on the floor. He traces the source of the puddle to the pipe that was only moist before. It is now dripping slowly and a large pool of dirty water is collecting in the shallow recess of the cement floor. 
Ed stares into the murky, black pool. 
There is a knock on the door upstairs and Ed turns to answer it. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Ed answers the door and sees that it is now dark outside. 
GEOFFREY COSTAS stands outside. Geoffrey, 54, is a wise, patient man. He is formal and calm in his manner, but these qualities belie a warm emotional vulnerability. Physically, he is not small or weak. One gets the impression that he wasn't always so kind. 
GEOFFREY 
Mr Saxon? 
ED 
Yes. 
GEOFFREY 
Hello.  My name is Geoffrey Costas.  I'm from Human Support Services. 
ED 
I'm not interested. 
GEOFFREY 
Detective Derm asked me to stop by. 
He hands him a business card.  Ed takes the card and looks it over. 
GEOFFREY 
You've been hit. 
ED 
I'm fine.  I don't need a doctor. 
He tries to hand the card back. 
GEOFFREY 
Oh, I'm not a physician.  I'm a psychiatrist.  But I'm not here on business.  This is my time off. 
ED 
This is a personal visit?  I don't understand. 
GEOFFREY 
Human Services is a volunteer organization.  We offer assistance to victims of traumatic crimes. 
ED 
What kind of assistance? 
GEOFFREY 
Advice, support, a shoulder to cry on. 
ED 
Why would I want to cry on your shoulder? 
GEOFFREY 
Maybe you just want someone to talk to.  It can be a lonely world when those you love are taken from you. 
ED 
No.  I don't think so. 
GEOFFREY 
Well, you have my card.  If you feel like talking at another time, please feel free to call. 
For what it's worth, I understand your position better than you think. Don't shut it all out. Sometimes that fragile connection to the rest of the world is all we have. I sincerely hope things turn out for you. Tomorrow then? 
ED 
Tomorrow. 
Ed shuts the door behind Geoffrey. 
INT. BATHROOM 
Ed works the plunger in the toilet. The water is still pink from the finger, but also might be pink from the pink toilet paper that is now broken up and mixed in with the water. 
He plunges the toilet a few more times and then stops to see if it is working. The water slowly goes down. He reaches behind the toilet and turns the water back on. He flushes it and it seems to be working again, albeit weakly. 
He sits on the edge of the bathtub and takes a breath. The water in the tub hasn't gone down, so he takes the plunger and starts to work it over the drain. 
After a minute, he sees that it isn't working. He reaches into the drain and pulls out a huge clump of scum-filled hair. It is repulsive to Ed. He throws it into the toilet. 
The water in the bathtub still hasn't gone down. 
INT. KITCHEN 
He searches under the sink through an exhaustive supply of cleaning supplies. He eventually pulls out a king-size container of Drano. 
INT. BATHROOM 
He reads the back of the container quickly, then pours the whole thing down the drain. 
He watches it for a second, waiting for it to go down. 
Slowly, then softly, the piano can be heard playing in the other room. 
Ed listens to it before following it down the hallway. 
INT. HALLWAY 
The lamp on Eve's writing desk is on and it lights up the end of the hallway.  The music still seems to be coming from her room. 
INT. EVE'S ROOM 
Ed comes in and looks around the room.  There is no one playing the piano, but the music continues over the rest of the scene. 
Ed's attention turns to the diary, which is still sitting on the desk where he left it. Ed sits in the chair and starts paging through Eve's diary. The piano continues playing. 
We hear Eve's voice as it must have been when she was writing. 
EVE 
(V.O.) 
More than three weeks late. Damn. I'm so stupid. I haven't told George because I'm sure he would use this as an excuse to pressure me to leave Ed. And how can I tell Ed. There's no way he could be the father. We haven't had sex in months. He would know it isn't is. 
Ed flips back a few pages. 
As he does, the camera starts to travel around the room, passing the piano, and then a few pictures from Eve's past, then some souvenirs on a shelf. 
EVE 
(V.O.) 
Saw a movie last night with George. It was awful; just the kind of movie Ed hates. I wanted to tell him about it, but I couldn't. I told him I was at Susie's. George loved it, of course. I think he likes every movie. Still, it was nice to go out on a date like that. It was fun. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Now the camera has turned to the empty hallway.  It slowly moves toward the bathroom. 
EVE 
(V.O.) 
Ed came home in a shitty mood and started picking a fight with me about a coffee cup I broke last week. It was the last thing I needed, today especially. Sometimes I fucking hate him. He can be such a shit. 
INT. KITCHEN 
The camera pans over the glass that has Eve's lipstick on it. 
EVE 
(V.O.) 
I can't believe what a jock George is. I knew he worked out, but he really takes car of himself. After we had sex, I was embarrassed to let him see me naked. How could I have gotten so fat? I'm going back to the gym tomorrow. I've really let myself go to pot. Maybe I'll get him a softball bat for his birthday next week. 
INT. BATHROOM 
The camera comes into the bathroom and passes over all of Eve's things sitting on the back of the toilet. 
EVE 
(V.O.) 
Ed doesn't sleep anymore. He's beginning to scare me. He takes all these pills to help him sleep, but they only make it worse. And he hates me. I can see it in his eyes. He blames me for everything that went wrong in his life. Maybe he's right. Maybe it is my fault. I feel so guilty about George that I can't argue with him anymore. I can't keep this up much longer. Fuck it. I'm going to tell him about George tomorrow. He knows anyway. He must know. He's been acting so weird. Poor Ed. He used to have so much ambition. And he's so talented. I just wish things had turned out better. 
The camera turns toward the bathtub, and focuses slowly in on the drain. A few bubbles pop out from under the water and the water starts to drain out. As the camera dollies in on the drain, the last of the murky water disappears. 
Ed, now standing in the bathroom, strikes a match and holds it up to the diary until the corner finally catches on fire. He fans out the pages so that it will catch more. 
When he can't hold it anymore, he drops it into the bathtub and watches it burn. He watches it until it has burnt itself out, burning into a pile of thick, black ashes. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Ed looks up at the smoke alarm.  He tries to pull it down, but it is out of his reach. 
Ed grabs a chair from the living room and stands on it so that he can reach the alarm. He pulls the cover off the alarm and then the battery out and the alarm is finally silenced. 
Then he hears voices coming from outside the front door. 
He approaches the front door cautiously, then puts his ear up to the door and listens. The voices are muted and whispered, but Ed can still hear what is being said, although it is hard to tell who is talking. 
HARVEY 
(O.S.) 
No.  I won't. 
SADIE 
(O.S.) 
You are so crazy. 
HARVEY 
ED 
Somebody hit me. 
SADIE 
Are you alright? 
ED 
I'm fine. 
SADIE 
Who hit you? 
ED 
I really don't want to get into it. 
SADIE 
I nearly had a heart attack when the police called me. 
ED 
What did they ask you? 
SADIE 
Just about me being here.  About what happened. 
ED 
But nothing happened. 
SADIE 
That's what I told them. 
ED 
They found your sweater.  It has blood all over it. 
SADIE 
You're kidding. 
ED 
You left it under the bed. 
SADIE 
Oh, yeah.  Damn.  I don't know why I do things like that. 
ED 
What if my wife had found it? 
SADIE 
Oh.  Is she here? 
ED 
No.  Look, Sadie.  I don't want you to get the wrong idea. 
SADIE 
Don't be mad. It's just that I worry too much. You didn't come to class again. And you said you would. I started getting all these ideas. I called you, but nobody answered. I meant to bring your wife's sweater back, but I forgot it. 
ED 
Actually, I'm glad you're here.  Can you do me a favor? 
SADIE 
Sure.  Anything. 
ED 
I have to get a prescription filled. 
SADIE 
No problem. 
Ed finds the prescription on his desk. 
ED 
I'd go myself, but I'm expecting a phone call. 
SADIE 
Sure. 
He hands her the prescription. 
ED 
There's a twenty-four pharmacy on Market. 
SADIE 
I know the one.  I go there all the time.  It's like my second home. 
ED 
I'll give you my credit card. 
Ed finds his wallet and hands her the card. 
SADIE 
I'll be back in a minute. 
ED 
Thank you. 
ED 
You put it all on my credit card, right? 
SADIE 
Actually, I paid for it.  They wouldn't take your card. 
ED 
Why not? 
SADIE 
They said you hadn't paid your bill, on the phone.  They called the credit card people when it didn't go through. 
ED 
Damn.  Well, I'll pay you back. 
SADIE 
It's OK.  I charged it to my Dad.  I don't even pay the bill. 
ED 
No, those pills are expensive.  And my insurance will cover it anyway. 
SADIE 
Pay me back later, then.  Really, it's OK. 
ED 
Are you sure? 
SADIE 
It's fine.  I swear. 
Sadie looks at the cuts on his face. 
SADIE 
Your face must hurt. 
ED 
No.  I don't seem to feel anything. 
SADIE 
It's nasty. 
Sadie takes a closer look. 
SADIE 
Here.  Sit down. 
She sits Ed down at the kitchen table, under a light, and sits across from him, then takes the peroxide and some cotton swabs she bought at the pharmacy and starts to dress his wounds. 
ED 
I've never been hit before. 
SADIE 
Me neither. 
ED 
It's not so bad, really. It's humbling, but I like the effect it seems to have on people. It seems to make them more compassionate. There's a competitive market for suffering in the world. It's difficult to stand out from the handicapped and the homeless and the politically oppressed. Sometimes a little advertising helps remind people that you're a human being. 
SADIE 
It does make you look sort of cute, in a pathetic kind of way. 
ED 
Sadie. 
SADIE 
Are you really married? 
ED 
What?  You think I just made it up? 
SADIE 
I don't know.  Some people just say they're married, you know, because maybe they think it's more respectable or something. 
ED 
I'm not one of those people. 
SADIE 
I didn't mean to imply anything.  It's just that you act sort of weird. 
ED 
I act weird? 
SADIE 
Not weird, really.  Worried, I guess.  Secretive.  Like you're worried I might find out something about you. 
ED 
You don't want to get involved with my problems. 
SADIE 
Maybe I do. 
ED 
Believe me, you don't. 
Yes. 
DERM 
It's Detective Derm.  I'm sorry to call you so late, but I thought you would want to hear this. 
ED 
Yes? 
DERM 
I'm afraid I have some bad news. 
ED 
What is it? 
DERM 
It's your wife.  We've found her... 
ED 
You found her. 
DERM 
We found her body. 
ED 
Her... 
DERM 
Yes, sir.  In the woods, near George Simian's house, where we found her car.  I'm afraid she's dead. 
Ed drops the phone.  He walks trance-like into the hallway. 
He follows the noise into the - 
INT. BATHROOM 
The noise coming from the bathroom now sounds more human, like a baby gurgling. 
As Ed walks into the bathroom, he can see that there is something in the bathtub. The shower curtain is closed, but behind it, there is some sort of body moving. Ed pulls the curtain back. He reveals a baby, just born, lying in the tub. Most of the murky water has drained and left a dirty ring around the tub. 
The BABY is a newborn, except that its eyes are maybe larger than they would be. The Baby is also SIX FEET TALL. It's immense frame fills the bathtub. It is naked (it's a boy). 
Ed watches with amazement. The baby looks incredibly real, except for its size. The stare at each other for a minute. The baby looks a lot like George Simian. It has his eyes. 
Other than this, it behaves like a baby. It is lying on its back, gurgling peacefully with his feet in the air and his left hand gripping the shower curtain. 
The baby reaches out for Ed lovingly. 
Ed backs away. 
Seeing this, the baby starts crying. 
Ed, panicking, approaches the baby. It is still crying. Ed reaches out to touch it. He touches its arm and the baby's crying starts to subside. The baby moves with typical, quick, chaotic movements that, because of the baby's size, are almost threatening. 
Ed puts his hand in the baby's hand. The baby grips it as baby's do, but this baby's hand is about the size of Ed's. The baby stops crying and returns to its curious gurgling. 
Ed tries to pull his hand back, but the baby won't let go. The baby, it seems, is incredibly strong. Ed pulls harder. He still can't get the baby to let go. Ed tries to pry the baby's fingers off, and this time manages to get his hand out of the baby's grip. 
But as soon as he does, the baby starts crying again. 
He backs out into the hallway. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Ed is in a panic.  The baby's cries echo around him as he backs away from the bathroom. 
INT. KITCHEN 
Ed finds himself in the kitchen. He looks at his hands which are covered with bloody muck from the tub. He washes them off in the sink. He looks over at the kitchen knife which has been drying in the dish rack. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Ed walks slowly, purposefully to the bathroom.  The crying baby gets louder as he approaches. 
INT. BATHROOM 
He comes into the bathroom, but in the tub, instead of the baby, there is a grown man's body. It is Ed, staring up at himself from under the water. We only see a very tight shot of BATHTUB ED's head and part of his neck. His head is under water and he looks up, unable to move. 
We then see the reverse shot of this and it is also of Ed, so that Ed is, in effect, looking up at himself through the cloudy water. 
The baby cries continue, although the baby is no longer in the scene. 
From Bathtub Ed's point of view, we see the other Ed takes the kitchen knife and lean forward and to the right, off-camera. 
Bathtub Ed, who can move his eyes, tries to look to his arm, where the other Ed is cutting. Soon, blood starts to mix with the water, diffusing over Bathtub Ed's face. 
The blood also diffuses over Bathtub Ed's P.O.V., as he looks up at the other Ed cutting him. When the other Ed is finished cutting, Bathtub Ed sees him put the knife aside and then reach down, off-camera. After a short struggle, the other Ed pulls up Bathtub Ed's severed arm and slips it into a garbage bag he has already prepared. 
The blood from Bathtub Ed's cut fills the water with dark blood, turning the film red. 
The red dissolves into a pool of blood that is in the hallway. 
INT. HALLWAY 
Ed, with a bucket and sponge, is cleaning pockets of blood from the floor and walls.  He is crying while he does this. 
He squeezes the sponge for the last time, then inspects the hallway as closely as he can, searching for any spots he might have missed. 
Then he picks up the bucket and takes it into the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM 
He dumps the water from the bucket into the bathtub. The water is pink and dirty. He sits down on the edge of the bathtub and watches the water go down the drain. 
He stares at the drain in a trance until he hears a knock on the front door.  He turns to listen to it in the other room. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
As he opens the bathroom door, he sees that the sun is shining in from the living room. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Geoffrey stands patiently outside as Ed opens the door. He carries his briefcase and looks dressed for work. His appearance is a stark contrast to the half-dressed, blood-shot Ed. 
Why would somebody do that? 
GEOFFREY 
Sometimes a man, when faced with his own problems or inadequacies, takes it out on someone weaker than themselves. 
ED 
I'm sorry. 
GEOFFREY 
Do you feel responsible at all for your wife's disappearance? 
ED 
Why? 
GEOFFREY 
People often blame themselves for events that they have no control over, especially when the events seem so random and cruel. Action leading up to tragedy tend to become more significant. Details weigh on the conscience. 
ED 
I do seem to be having problems with my conscience. 
GEOFFREY 
I see. 
ED 
Do you think that's why I can't sleep? 
GEOFFREY 
Could be. 
ED 
Is there anything you can give me? 
GEOFFREY 
A prescription?  For your conscience?  Of course not. 
ED 
Then what's the point? 
GEOFFREY 
There are other ways I can be of help. 
ED 
A shoulder to cry on? 
GEOFFREY 
Would you like me to call the police?  There might be some news. 
ED 
The police called last night, late last night.  They found Eve's body. 
GEOFFREY 
Oh, no. 
ED 
They found her buried in the woods, near where they found her car. 
GEOFFREY 
I'm sorry.  I didn't know. 
Geoffrey's watch alarm goes off. He looks at the time and then, habitually takes a shiny silver pillbox from his pocket. He takes two pills out. 
GEOFFREY 
Excuse me. 
ED 
I never knew I could feel so alone. 
Geoffrey takes a thermos from his briefcase, pours some hot tea into the lid and swallows the pills with a mouthful of tea. 
GEOFFREY 
He hasn't called since last night? 
ED 
No. 
GEOFFREY 
It's been a while.  Why don't you let me call him?  Maybe there's some news. 
When Ed doesn't object, Geoffrey takes his address book from his briefcase, along with a cellular phone and dials the number. 
GEOFFREY 
Detective Derm, please. Hi, Charlie, it's Geoffrey. I'm over at Ed Saxon's house. Yeah. He was hoping to get some information on his wife. Uh-huh. Well, he said you called him last night and told him that you had found her body. Uh-huh. I see. In the woods, near where you found her car. I don't know. Yes. Well, I did give him something to help him sleep. Right. Yes. 
Then Geoffrey turns away from Ed and says a few words quietly, so that Ed can't hear.  Then... 
GEOFFREY 
Yes.  Yes.  I'll tell him.  Yes.  OK.  Bye. 
Geoffrey hangs up and turns back to Ed. 
ED 
What? 
GEOFFREY 
George. 
GEORGE 
What did you do to Eve? 
ED 
I didn't do anything. 
GEORGE 
I know you did. I saw her before she left work. We met in the parking lot, like we always did. She told me she was leaving you. She was going to tell you when she got home. 
ED 
You don't know anything about it. 
GEORGE 
Yes, I do.  I know you.  Eve talks about you.  She tell me things. 
ED 
What things? 
GEORGE 
I know about the fights you have. 
ED 
She's my wife.  We fight sometimes. 
GEORGE 
That's bullshit.  I know what kind of a son of bitch you can be.  She's told me. 
ED 
What don't you tell it to the police? 
GEORGE 
I did. 
ED 
You think she was some sort of angel?  She was cheating on me. 
GEORGE 
I love her.  I loved her. 
Ed listens to George break down. 
ED 
I'm sorry. 
There is a long pause. 
GEORGE 
It's not enough. 
George hangs up. 
INT. BATHROOM 
The bathroom is completely clean. There is no sign of any of the activity from before. Ed finds the bottle of prescription sleeping pills. It is empty. He takes a couple of Midol and swallows them dry. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Ed sits down at his desk.  He looks over the papers on his desk.  Sadie's is on top.  He looks it over. 
The phone rings and he picks it up. 
ED 
Hello? 
SADIE 
Hello. 
ED 
Sadie. 
SADIE 
I wanted to apologize. 
ED 
No.  Don't apologize.  It was me. 
SADIE 
I shouldn't have left like that.  I don't know what came over me. 
ED 
It was understandable, under the circumstances. 
SADIE 
I really wanted you to like me. 
ED 
I wonder if you'll still feel the same way when you find out what kind of person I really am. 
SADIE 
I'll still keep your poem on my wall. 
ED 
Yes.

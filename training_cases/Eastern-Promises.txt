He grins. 
AZIZ And you have to open it in front of me. 
Aziz smiles as Anna unwraps a pair of leather motorcycling gloves. She looks up at him, expressionless. 
AZIZ (CONT'D) At least pretend. 
Anna considers the gloves. 
ANNA (deadpan)) In the whole entire history of my life, I have never felt this special. 
AZIZ Thank you.

Aziz plants a kiss on his two fingers and presses his fingers against Anna's cheek through the open visor of the helmet. 
AZIZ (CONT'D) Wear them.       It's cold. 
8   EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY                                         8 
Anna rides her big vintage URAL motorcycle through deserted morning streets. As she rides, we hear Tatiana in V.O. 
TATIANA (V.O.) I am so excited this morning. Yesterday a friend came back to our village and he told us all about the places on the map that I look at... Paris, Amsterdam, London. He's been there for real... 
9   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. ANNA'S BEDROOM - DAY                         9 
After the bright airiness of the bike ride, we are suddenly in Anna's bedroom where the curtains are drawn. Anna is lying awake on the bed, wearing a dressing gown. 
TATIANA (V.O.) ...he said the future of everything was already happening in all those places. 
There is a gentle knock at the door, which opens before Anna can respond. It is ANNA'S MOTHER (HELEN) with a cup of tea. 
HELEN Did you sleep? 
ANNA A bit. 
HELEN There's no point us tiptoeing around if you're not even sleeping. 
Helen puts the tea on the dressing table, then turns to leave without a smile. 
ANNA Mum?       Are you OK?

10   INT.   HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY                             10 
Anna is pouring two glasses of sherry. Helen is peeling potatoes. Anna peers at Helen... and sees tears. They share a moment of stifled emotion. Helen wipes her eyes with her sleeve. 
HELEN It's the chicken. (pause) The smell of chicken roasting reminds me of him. 
ANNA You should have done beef, then. 
They look at each other and giggle. They both have potato peelers in their wet hands, sleeves rolled up, two practical unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave of emotion. 
HELEN It wouldn't be Christmas without tears in the gravy, would it. 
We hear a gruff Russian voice calling out from the living room (UNCLE STEPAN). 
STEPAN (V.O.) (angry) Anna! Anna!    Where did you get this? 
Anna and Helen roll their eyes. 
HELEN (whispering) It's your own fault for giving him something to play with. 
ANNA (irritated) Well, I can't read Russian, can I? 
Anna drops her peeler and hurries into the living room.

The living room table is laid for dinner. Uncle Stepan is early seventies, Russian. He is reading the tiny diary that Anna found in Tatiana's bag. Anna breezes in. 
Kirill glares at Anna as she approaches the front of the restaurant. 
14   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                              14 
As Nikolai drives away, Anna rings the doorbell beside the front door. There is no reply. She is about to ring again when the door opens. We see SEMYON, a Russian man in his late sixties. He is wiping his hands on a tea towel, dressed in a spotlessly white apron. He has the sparkling piercing eyes of a falcon. 
SEMYON We are closed. 
ANNA I know. 
She fumbles in her bag. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Sorry... I'm a midwife. 
Anna produces her hospital ID and shows it to Semyon.

SEMYON (with a twinkle) Then unless one of my daughters is keeping something from me, you have the wrong address. 
ANNA I'd like to speak to the Manager. 
Semyon studies the name on the ID. 
SEMYON Khitrova? 
ANNA My dad was Russian. 
Semyon seems suddenly delighted. 
SEMYON And his name? 
ANNA Ivan. 
SEMYON So, you are Anna Ivanovna. 
15   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                           15 
The tables are set for a huge party. Kirill is now on step ladders, fixing some Christmas decorations. Other relatives are getting the place ready. Semyon hurries through the restaurant, leading Anna by the hand. 
SEMYON We must hurry. I must stir. Stir, stir or the gravy dies in my hands. Today it is family. Here is my son, Kirill. (he hisses at Kirill) Kirill! The berries are too low, too low. And Roman, more glasses for red! (he claps his hands) Come on! 
Kirill follows Anna's progress through the restaurant with a glare.

SEMYON (CONT'D) My angels. You should be practising. You must make the wood cry. Like this, like this... 
Semyon grabs a violin and plays a three-second burst of sad Russian violin music. 
SEMYON (CONT'D) You see... 
Semyon hurries on into the kitchen.    Anna smiles, delighted at the eccentric old man. 
16   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. KITCHEN - DAY                   16 
Inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam, smoke. Family members, some dressed in their party outfits, others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots, laughing, arguing. Children play and yell. You can almost smell Christmas. Anna enters, dazzled by it all, overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless Christmas kitchen. Semyon calls out to everyone. 
SEMYON Come, come, hurry, hurry.    They will be here any moment. (to Anna) Ok, show me this card. 
Anna reaches into her pocket and produces the `Trans- Siberian' business card she found in Tatiana's bag. Semyon angles his head to look as he stirs. 
SEMYON (CONT'D) It is the old card. From before the renovations. But even so, if she had worked here I would remember the name. Perhaps she ate here once. Try this. 
Semyon offers Anna a spoonful of his gravy.    She sips it. 
ANNA God, that's amazing. My dad made gravy just like that.

20   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - DAY                               20 
Anna emerges into the daylight. As she does she sees that four expensive-looking cars have already parked and various ostentatiously dressed Russian and Turkish couples with their children are emerging from their cars. The women are all wearing furs, even the little girls. The men wear leather or dark suits. They greet each other exuberantly as they emerge from their cars. Anna suddenly feels slightly uneasy. As she approaches her motorbike she sees Nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking, still wearing shades. His bumper is almost touching Anna's bike. 
NIKOLAI (in Russian) Nice bike. 
ANNA What? 
NIKOLAI Nice bike. 
ANNA Thank you. 
NIKOLAI A Ural. You don't see them anymore. 
ANNA It was my dad's. 
NIKOLAI How much do you want for it? 
Anna has already taken a dislike to this man. He is arrogant and looks potentially violent. His shades, suit and tattoos say it all. 
ANNA (irritated) It has sentimental value. 
Nikolai rolls the concept around in his mind and considers.

ANNA No. 
NIKOLAI Nor me. Chauffeurs don't get invited. You want to go for a drink instead? 
Anna mounts her bike. 
ANNA It's Christmas. Everything's closed. 
Nikolai smiles. 
NIKOLAI Sometimes if things are closed you just open them up, you know? 
Anna now feels intimidated and luckily the bike fires first time. She rides away. Nikolai watches her go and then stubs his cigarette. 
21   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. DINING ROOM - NIGHT                        21 
Sudden silence... perhaps the ticking of a clock. This is Anna's Christmas dinner, a total contrast to the chaos of the restaurant. Stepan is attempting to carve the chicken. 
STEPAN Anna, how come is it that your boyfriend isn't here to carve? 
Stepan takes a large sip of vodka. 
ANNA I don't live with Oliver any more, Uncle Stepan. I'm living back here for a bit.

STEPAN I knew he would run away from you.

Kirill cuts the call and nods to Ozim, who stubs his cigar. Semyon notices their silent communication, then turns to one of the violin-playing angels, smiles, and kisses her on both cheeks.

The three men walk to the door beside the barber shop. Ozim takes a bunch of keys out and prepares to open the door to the upstairs. He stops. 
OZIM The driver stays down here. 
Kirill smiles and shakes his head. 
KIRILL You really think I do this kind of thing? 
Kirill puts his hand on Nikolai's shoulder 
KIRILL (CONT'D) This guy's not a driver. He's an undertaker. 
Ozim looks at Nikolai, highly dubious. BLUE Revision   -   11/4/06                               24.

The rooms above Ozim's shop have been converted into a drinking club. Ozim leads Nikolai and Kirill through the debris of the night before. As they walk through, Ekrem suddenly leaps out of the darkness with a yell. Kirill and Nikolai both react with instinctive aggression. 
OZIM Hey, hey, hey Ekrem, sakim, durgun, durgun. 
EKREM I got tickets, Ozim. It's with Chelsea. They said there was no tickets but I got tickets for the Chelsea game. 
OZIM OK, OK, OK.    You go and watch a DVD, yeah? 
Ekrem nods and hugs Ozim. We realize he is slightly deranged. Finally he lets Ozim go and leaves. Kirill watches him go. 
KIRILL He knows to say he hasn't seen us, right Ozim? 
Ozim finds the key to the kitchen. 
OZIM He don't know anything.    He's touched by the angels. 
Ozim opens the kitchen door.

Inside the kitchen there are carcasses of lambs hanging from meat hooks. There are knives and skewers around the place. Ozim stops and locks the kitchen door behind them.

The freezer door opens and Ozim gestures towards a large package bound up in black bin liners which are dusted with frost. Kirill nods to Nikolai who grabs the package and hauls it out onto the kitchen floor. Kirill tears a hole in the bin liner and we see the frost-dusted face of Soyka.

KIRILL That's him. 
Kirill crosses himself.

He puts his hand on his heart with mock solemnity. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) Now he looks like a fucking ice cream.

There is a knock at the door and Semyon looks up sharply. His eyes glisten. He puts his novel aside.

Semyon and Anna are sitting down at the candlelit table. Anna fumbles in her bag and produces a sheaf of photocopied sheets. She has photocopied the pages of the diary and they are laid out in segments on each page. 
ANNA I copied the whole thing. 
Semyon takes the pages and looks troubled.

Semyon looks thwarted but hides it well. He studies the photocopied sheets for a while then looks up and smiles. 
SEMYON I will need my spectacles and a clear head. Today I broke my rules and drank vodka. Tomorrow I will translate it. 
He folds the papers carefully. 
SEMYON (CONT'D) Then I will bring what I have done to your home. Where do you live, Anna? 
There is nothing in Semyon's smile to cause alarm but Anna perhaps remembers Nikolai. Finally... 
ANNA Not far.    I can drop by and pick it up. 
SEMYON Then maybe I can drive you home. 
ANNA I'm fine.    I'm on my motorbike.

Semyon doesn't blink. At that moment a little girl of seven (MARIA) emerges from the darkness, carrying a soft toy. 
MARIA Grandpa. 
SEMYON Hey, hey, Maria, go back to bed. 
MARIA I'm too sad. Next Christmas isn't for another hundreds and hundreds of days. 
Semyon takes her onto his knee. As he does, we see, for the first time, an eagle tattoo on his wrist. 
SEMYON But you have had so many presents. 
The girl wafts Semyon's cigar smoke. 
MARIA You shouldn't smoke, Grandpa. 
SEMYON I know. 
Semyon cuddles Maria and stubs his cigar. 
Anna smiles at the warm family scene, perhaps remembering her own father.

Anna smiles politely.

Nikolai turns.

STEPAN No Anna! You don't go to someone else with this! You don't go to anyone! Nasilovanie, it means rape. Iglah, it means needle. Prostitutcia, perhaps you can guess. 
Stepan hands the diary to Anna and then turns. 
STEPAN (CONT'D) I go to wash my hands. 
He disappears. Anna and Helen are left in awkward silence. Anna buries the diary in her dressing table drawer. Helen looks at her with anxiety. 
HELEN Anna, Stepan said this girl ended up in the hands of the vory v zakone. Do you know what that means? 
ANNA Just because I'm back in this room doesn't mean I'm twelve again. 
HELEN You never listened to me even then! 
ANNA Look, if I don't find a relative in the next few days they'll put Christine out for fostering. Once she's in the system, she'll never get out again. 
A pause. 
HELEN Who named her Christine?

ANNA I had to call her something. It sounds like Christmas. (pause) She's very beautiful. 
Helen is now deeply concerned. 
HELEN If I can persuade Stepan to translate it, will you leave the rest to the police? 
Anna looks at Helen, then digs out the diary and hands it to her. 
ANNA Tell him I've heard bad words before. 
Helen is about to leave.       She stops in the doorway. 
HELEN Your father used to say the vory are a contagious disease. There's no cure once they've touched you. 
A pause.   Anna smiles. 
ANNA Momma, this is London. 
42   INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. NEGLECTED SITTING ROOM - DAY                42 
We are in HARLESDEN, NORTH LONDON. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) I'm recommending you to my dad. I want to make sure you're not a fucking queer. 
Kirill looks suddenly wild.          He swigs his whisky.   A long pause. 
NIKOLAI You've drunk enough Kirill. 
KIRILL Enough? 
Kirill hurls his whisky bottle against the wall.            The girls all flinch. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) You fucking Siberian ox don't tell a vor what is enough. 
A pause.   Nikolai studies Kirill's anger. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) I've brought you to my dad's best stable. He uses this place himself. They're all clean. Now I'm going to watch you fuck one of these girls to prove to me that you ain't queer. 
A pause. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) So which one is it going to be? 
Silence. Nikolai looks around the room.           Finally... Nikolai turns to the girl who is sobbing. 
NIKOLAI Her. 
Kirill smiles. WHITE Revision    -   9/12/06                            44. 
45   INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE. BEDROOM - DAY                             45 
Nikolai is fucking the girl, who is now silent.   She is on all fours, registering no emotion. 
Kirill is leaning against the wall, drinking wine from the bottle, watching Nikolai with burning eyes, his lust and drunken jealousy mixing together. Nikolai grits his teeth and comes inside the girl. Kirill whoops and whistles and begins to applaud. 
The girl is still silent, expressionless. 
KIRILL You did OK!     You did OK. 
NIKOLAI Yeah? 
Nikolai glares at Kirill. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) Well if my examination is over, get the fuck out of here while I get dressed. 
Kirill grins and offers the girl an elaborate bow before leaving. Finally alone, Nikolai gently helps the girl to lie down. She is numb. He covers her up with a blanket then begins to pull on his clothes. The girl is staring up at the ceiling. 
After a few moments she begins to sing a Russian folk song softly under her breath. Nikolai speaks to her softly in Russian. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) (in Russian) What's your last name? 
A pause. Finally the girl stops singing but is silent. Nikolai is insistent. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) (in Russian) Tell me your last name. 
GIRL Kirilenko.

NIKOLAI (in Russian) Where are you from? 
Silence. She looks up and stares into Nikolai's eyes. She sees some urgency there... 
GIRL Ukraine. 
NIKOLAI (in Ukrainian) Where? Which village? Which town? 
GIRL (in Ukrainian) Irpen. Outside Kiev. 
The girl is asking a silent question but Nikolai doesn't linger. He heads for the door then stops and turns. 
NIKOLAI (in Ukrainian) Stay alive a little longer. 
46   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -46 NIGHT 
In the half-lit private room, Anna is dancing with Christine in her arms. She is singing a lullaby softly to her. The door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other babies are silent. 
Finally she lays a sleeping Christine back in her crib. She sits down on the bed where the mother should be. She curses herself silently and gets to her feet, determined to pull herself together. 
As she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward, she is suddenly confronted by Semyon. 
He is standing in the shadows, a Bavarian trilby in his hands. Anna gasps with shock. Semyon speaks softly... 
SEMYON Hello Anna.     I came on tiptoes. 
ANNA How did you get in here? 
TATIANA (V.O.) I was thrown down the stairs and fell onto some sacks, like potato sacks... 
47   INT. HELEN'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY                              47 
Stepan is sitting at the kitchen table, translating Tatiana's diary aloud, as Helen transcribes it onto a note pad. Stepan's translation breaks up with emotion but he tries to remain detached. Helen also tries hard to concentrate on her task but wipes away a tear as she writes. Tatiana's V.O. slowly blends into Stepan's voice... 
STEPAN ...like potato sacks. Kirill came down after me and he hit me until I was bleeding. Then he tried to rape me but he couldn't do it... He just got madder and madder and kept hitting me. In the end his father came down. It was the father who raped me. He shouted at his son...'if you don't break a horse, it will never be tame, Kirill'. 
They hear a key in the door and prepare for Anna's arrival. When she enters she feels the tense silence. After a moment, Helen tries to be bright... 
HELEN Hello dear. How was your night? 
Anna sees the tears in both their eyes.   She sees the diary and the transcription and sits down. 
HELEN (CONT'D) Stepan's arthritis is playing up. I'm taking dictation. 
Helen gets to her feet. 
HELEN (CONT'D) Would you like some tea or something? 
ANNA No. 
Anna gently pushes Helen back into her seat.

HELEN What's wrong? 
ANNA He came to see me. 
Silence. 
ANNA (CONT'D) The man from the restaurant.    He came to the hospital. 
Stepan leaps to his feet. 
STEPAN I told you this would happen!    I told you! 
HELEN Sit down Stepan. 
STEPAN The devil is loose now. 
Everyone begins to talk at once... 
ANNA I know it's my fault... 
HELEN It's no one's fault... 
STEPAN They are in this room now.   They are cancer... 
HELEN We should just sit down calmly and think... 
STEPAN I have a friend from Ukraine who owns a gun.... 
HELEN Stepan!! 
STEPAN ...from the war in Afghanistan.

HELEN Don't talk about guns... 
Anna suddenly stands up. 
ANNA Shut up both of you!!! 
Silence.   Everyone catches their breath. 
ANNA (CONT'D) OK... now... what would dad have done? 
A pause. 
STEPAN We all know what he would have done. 
Stepan heads for the kitchen cupboard and produces a bottle of vodka. Rather than admonish him, Anna and Helen both nod agreement. Stepan pours three large vodkas. Stepan knocks his down. Anna and Helen take sips. 
HELEN And then he would have been practical. 
STEPAN He would ask if there were bullets for the gun. 
HELEN No! This isn't our world.     We're just... ordinary people. 
KIRILL You bet it's fucking good... 
Nikolai hands the bottle back. As he does, one of the van doors is kicked closed revealing Semyon, suddenly upon them. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) Jesus Christ, Papa... You scared me.... 
Semyon grabs the bottle of champagne and smashes it on the floor. Kirill recoils in terror. Nikolai straightens, faces up. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) What's wrong? We're just sampling it! 
Semyon is so furious he still can't speak. He grabs Kirill and slams him against the wall. Finally he hisses in his face. 
SEMYON Your friend Soyka is dead. 
KIRILL Yeah? So what? What's that got to do with me? 
SEMYON Don't lie to me!! 
Semyon slams Kirill against the wall once more.

SEMYON I said, don't lie to me! 
Semyon slams Kirill hard against the wall again.       Suddenly Nikolai steps forward. 
NIKOLAI Your dad is right, Kirill.       There's no point lying to him. 
A pause. Semyon and Kirill are frozen for a moment. Nikolai calmly lights a cigarette. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) Ozim's nephew slit Soyka's throat. Kirill paid him to do it. 
There is stunned silence.       Semyon loosens his grip on Kirill. 
KIRILL (in Russian) Shut your fucking mouth! 
NIKOLAI (in Russian) Your dad always knows the truth anyway. 
Nikolai and Semyon survey each other. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) But it's OK boss. You don't have to worry... 
SEMYON (incredulous) I don't have to worry? 
NIKOLAI I disposed of the body myself. The police won't find a thing. 
Semyon has now lost all interest in Kirill and is concentrating on Nikolai. He laughs with incredulity. 
SEMYON My son commits a murder? (MORE)

SEMYON (CONT'D) On my own doorstep? A fellow soldier! And no one thought to tell me about it? 
NIKOLAI The vory code says you don't talk to anybody about your captain. Kirill is my captain. 
Semyon circles Nikolai. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) When I found out what had happened, I did what I had to do to clean the situation up. 
Kirill is about to speak but before he can, Nikolai speaks for him. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) It was a matter of honor. Soyka was spreading lies about Kirill. About your family. (in Russian) Kirill did the right thing. 
Semyon hisses with fury and grabs Nikolai. 
SEMYON I decide what is right and what is wrong. You do not kill a vor for no reason. 
Nikolai shrugs Semyon off, holding his ground. 
NIKOLAI You know as well as I do Soyka was talking to the police. 
A pause. Semyon is shocked at the depth of Nikolai's knowledge. He peers at him. 
SEMYON For a driver, you are well informed. 
NIKOLAI I've got connections with the Chechens who export cars. Soyka was speaking to the Russian desk. Scotland Yard.

Anna races out of the restaurant in pursuit of Nikolai.

ANNA She was fourteen! Read the diary! She was fourteen when he raped her! 
Nikolai casually hits the key fob of his car. 
ANNA (CONT'D) You murdered her! You bastards murdered her! 
Passers-by stare at Anna. Helen and Stepan have come out of the restaurant to restrain her. Nikolai stops and judges the fury on Anna's face. He speaks calmly. 
NIKOLAI Anger is very dangerous. It makes people do stupid things. Forget any of this ever happened. You're in the wrong place, Anna Ivanovna. 
He gestures at the burger restaurant. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) You belong in there. With nice people. Stay away from people like me. 
Anna and Nikolai are staring at each other, suddenly a strange connection between them. 
Then Stepan steps forward and spits in Nikolai's face, delivering a Russian curse as he does so. Nikolai almost reacts out of instinct but stops himself. 
Nikolai wipes his face and peers into Anna's eyes.       Finally he gets into his car and drives away. 
52   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                             52 
Nikolai is alone, sitting at a candlelit table, reading Tatiana's diary. We hear Tatiana in voice-over... 
TATIANA (V.O.) I am not sure I can carry on another day. The windows won't open so I can't throw myself out. They inject me every day with heroin. (MORE)

TATIANA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Sometimes I think this is all a hallucination... 
He sees Semyon approaching from the kitchen and closes the diary. Semyon grabs a bottle of vodka from the bar on his way to sit opposite Nikolai. Nikolai pushes the diary across the table. Semyon pours two drinks. 
SEMYON It is good to have someone who I can trust to do simple tasks. 
A pause as Semyon glances at a few pages of diary. 
SEMYON (CONT'D) In this business, sometimes the biggest danger comes from the most stupid things. You can't afford to be careless in any area. 
Nikolai senses a change of attitude towards him. As if Semyon were beginning to accept him into the fold. Semyon raises a toast. 
SEMYON (CONT'D) Nasdrovia. 
NIKOLAI Nasdrovia. 
After a moment. 
SEMYON So what was the lie that Soyka was spreading about my son? 
Nikolai looks anxious. 
NIKOLAI (in Russian) It was nothing important. 
SEMYON Kirill had him killed for nothing important? 
Semyon pours two more vodkas. 
NIKOLAI I don't want to repeat it.

Nikolai doesn't respond. It is obvious that Semyon half knows already. He shrugs... 
SEMYON (CONT'D) You play   with the Prince to do business   with the King. But if you want   to do business with me you must   be open with me. Thieves- in-law.

60   EXT. HOUSING ESTATE - NIGHT                                    60 
A large public housing estate is being swept by rain. Christmas lights glow in the windows of the dilapidated tower blocks. Stepan is walking against the wind, carrying a bag of shopping. He holds onto his Russian hat to stop it blowing away. Kids splash in the puddles. 
Stepan arrives at the front garden of his small, ground- floor council flat. As he fumbles for his keys in the cold we see that Nikolai is watching him from the driver's seat of his Mercedes. Once Stepan has disappeared into his flat, Nikolai gets out of the car and approaches Stepan's flat.

ANNA Mum... I can't get hold of Stepan. 
HELEN Why do you want to? 
ANNA I need to check something with him. 
HELEN Anna... 
ANNA (matter of fact) He's not at home, do you know where else he might be? 
Helen simply stares at her. 
HELEN Anna. Haven't you had enough excitement?

HELEN You enjoy this.

HELEN (CONT'D) You're like your father. Ordinary life isn't enough. 
Anna turns and walks out of the house.

63   EXT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT                        63 
Anna is standing in the falling rain, staring over at the trans-Siberian restaurant. The restaurant is busy, with the noise of revelers swelling every time the door is opened. 
Anna seems to be exiled from where she should really be - 
Inside a restaurant like this, with its danger and vibrancy. 
Suddenly she is illuminated by headlights. She turns and sees that Nikolai is pulling up in his Mercedes. Kirill is in the passenger seat. Nikolai gets out of the car and stops when he sees Anna. Anna is like a fox caught in headlights. 
NIKOLAI What are you doing here?

Kirill studies the gaze between Nikolai and Anna and senses the connection. 
KIRILL If you're passing, you pass. You keep going, bitch. Nikolai, come on... 
Kirill grabs Nikolai's arm, and after peering at Anna for a moment, he turns to go with Kirill. Anna gathers her courage. 
ANNA Family is important to you people isn't it? 
KIRILL (laughing) 'You people'? (in Russian) What the hell is she talking about? 
Music swells from the restaurant. 
ANNA Tell Semyon the baby I delivered on Christmas Eve is his daughter. 
Kirill and Nikolai stop. A swell of laughter from the restaurant. Anna is about to continue but Nikolai steps forward and places two fingers on Anna's lips to stop her from saying anymore. Anna tears his hands from her mouth. 
SEMYON No. He stays here.   I want to talk business. 
A confused pause.     Kirill looks from Nikolai to his father. 
KIRILL What business? 
A pause as Kirill suddenly senses his exclusion. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) Papa, what business? His business is my business. 
Semyon stares at Kirill and Kirill knows the look. 
SEMYON Go to the cellar Kirill.   And take your time. 
Kirill hesitates. He is angry as hell but too scared of his father's gaze to say anything. Finally he turns fast and departs, slamming his open hand against the door as he goes. 
Semyon waits a moment before returning to the business of cutting the cake. Finally... 
SEMYON (CONT'D) Did you deal with the old man? 
Nikolai nods.

Semyon returns to his work.    Nikolai hesitates. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) What shall I tell Kirill? 
Semyon continues with the cake, unconcerned. 
SEMYON Tell him I changed my mind about the brandy. 
65   INT. TRANS-SIBERIAN RESTAURANT. CELLAR - NIGHT                65 
The cellar is half lit, the arched walls lined with crates of wine. Flour, grease and potatoes are stored here. As Nikolai walks down the steps into the gloom, he hears Kirill singing a Russian folk song to himself as he drags a case of brandy across the cellar floor. 
Kirill has already opened a bottle of brandy and takes a long swig as Nikolai joins him. He grins as he gestures at the brandy... 
KIRILL My dad swapped a little Georgian girl for this stuff. 
Nikolai sits down on a crate, rests his head against the wall. Kirill joins him and swigs some more. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) Hey, don't feel bad. What happened up there is just how he is. He plays people against each other. That's all. I realize more and more what he's like. Here, drink to the Georgian girl... 
Kirill offers the bottle to Nikolai but he refuses.

KIRILL (CONT'D) What?   I drink alone now. 
Nikolai decides to bite the bullet, get this news over with. 
NIKOLAI He offered me stars. I accepted them. 
A long pause. This is what Kirill wanted, but now it feels like a stab in the back. Finally Kirill swallows a huge swig of brandy then turns awkwardly to hug Nikolai. He squeezes him hard for a long time then shoves him away. 
KIRILL (lying)) You think I didn't know already? He told me before. It was my fucking idea. He said there are a lot of things I have to teach you. 
Nikolai nods.    Kirill gets to his feet.... 
KIRILL (CONT'D) Some stuff will take a long time. I've been protecting you until now. 
NIKOLAI Yeah. 
KIRILL What? 
A pause. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) You think I don't know stuff you don't know? I am vor by birth. The stars are a birthmark for me... 
NIKOLAI I know, Kirill. 
Kirill is about to fly into a rage but Nikolai gets to his feet. 
A wizened old Russian man (THE TATTOOIST) arrives at the kitchen door, carrying a battered leather case. The kitchen door is opened as he arrives and Semyon greets him.

Nikolai is sitting in a banquette at the back, wearing only his underpants. We circle Nikolai as the tattooist begins to work on his knees, preparing Nikolai's knee caps for the tattoos. 
The needle bites at Nikolai's skin as the old tattooist wipes away the blood. 
Then we see the needle working on the empty spaces above Nikolai's heart, tattooing the star symbol. 
Nikolai now has a star tattoo on each knee and two eight- pointed stars on his chest. He is now a member of the vory v zakone.

Anna is lying awake, her curtains drawn against the daylight. Helen knocks and enters with a cup of tea, just as in the opening scenes. Anna sits up. 
HELEN (almost accusing) Have you slept at all? 
Anna doesn't answer.    Helen looks anxious as she peeks out of the curtains. 
HELEN (CONT'D) I tried to get hold of Stepan for you.

HELEN (CONT'D) He's usually either at home or at his sisters. But she hasn't heard from him at all.

HELEN (CONT'D) You haven't spoken to him since, have you? 
Anna doesn't answer and Helen's anger sparks... She leaves and slams the door. 
71   EXT. TURKISH BATHS - DAY                                        71 
We are in St. Pancras, North London. 
More rain. Ozim is waiting nervously, blowing into his hands against the cold. The Turkish bath building is a Victorian red-brick edifice. 
Nikolai pulls up in his Mercedes. 
72   INT. TURKISH BATHS. CHANGING ROOM - DAY                         72 
Ozim and Nikolai are undressing. The place is deserted apart from an OLD TURKISH BATH-HOUSE ATTENDANT who is distributing towels. Ozim is unbuttoning his shirt. 
OZIM Semyon recommends these places for business meetings because you can see what tattoos a man has. 
Nikolai is pulling off his shirt and Ozim reacts to the sight of the fresh eight-pointed star tattoos. Ozim chuckles. 
OZIM (CONT'D) Come on. We have a lot to get through. Let's cook. 
Ozim disappears into a steam room, naked. Nikolai watches him go, a private agenda bubbling beneath the surface.

74   INT. TURKISH BATHS. STEAM ROOM - DAY                           74 
Ozim and Nikolai sit side by side, sweating.    There is no one else in the steam room. 
OZIM Our lines to Kabul get broken every two or three weeks. 
NIKOLAI How come? 
OZIM The Americans. Fucking NATO. (pause) Valery Nabokov imports flowers and television sets into this country. The television sets are one in ten. That means one in ten have cargo inside them. 
NIKOLAI Where do they dock? 
80   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - DAY              80 
Nikolai is conscious in bed, attached to a single drip. His wounds have been stitched up. 
A doctor and two nurses are settling Nikolai's vital signs, moving around him, checking his temperature. Finally they clear the bed and through the glass of the room we see Anna, standing outside, staring in at Nikolai. 
81   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - NIGHT            81 
Nikolai is peering through half-opened eyes. The last nurse is checking his vital signs. Then Anna enters. The nurse stops work... 
NURSE Anna? 
ANNA Is it OK to talk to him for a minute? 
The nurse hesitates... 
NURSE He's still in trauma.   Do you know him? 
Anna glances at Nikolai who is rousing himself.

ANNA Yes. 
The nurse is reluctant but sees Anna's fierce stare and finally leaves. After she has gone Nikolai stirs, focuses on her face. 
NIKOLAI I thought you did birth. 
Nikolai smiles, but Anna is trying hard to even out her fear and anger. 
ANNA My uncle.... 
Nikolai tries to sit up and registers pain. 
ANNA (CONT'D) ...the one who spat in your face... He's disappeared. 
A pause. Nikolai gasps in pain as he raises himself up. Anna sees the wounds on his arms and glimpses the tattoos on his chest, scaring her even more. 
ANNA (CONT'D) If we don't hear from him soon we're going to the police... 
Nikolai reaches for a bottle of water and manages to take a swig. Anna is impatient for a reaction. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Do you know where he is? 
A pause. Nikolai finishes the bottle of water in one thirsty swig. Finally... 
NIKOLAI Yes. 
A pause. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) He's in Scotland. In Edinburgh. In a five-star hotel. 
Anna is locating the door in case she has to flee as Nikolai swings his legs out of the bed to stretch his painful limbs.

ANNA Edinburgh? 
NIKOLAI I'm going to need some clothes. I arrived here without any. Can you get me some? 
Anna doesn't budge. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) I can't walk out of here naked. 
ANNA You can't walk out of here because you're attached to a drip. Explain Edinburgh. 
Nikolai sighs, sits back down on the bed.    He finally speaks softly. 
NIKOLAI Your uncle knew too much. 
Nikolai shrugs. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) I was told to get rid of him. I was meant to send him to heaven with a bullet in his head. Instead I sent him to Edinburgh. With a first-class ticket. 
A pause. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) He is of the old school. He understood the situation. Exile or death. Edinburgh was his idea. He said they throw a great party at New Year. And he said it was a good excuse to get away from his family. 
Nikolai smiles at Anna. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) So... just a pair of jeans and a T- shirt. A jacket. And some shoes. 
YURI (CONT'D) My God... 
NIKOLAI If they terminate the operation now, they will be wasting this... 
A pause. Yuri looks shocked and slightly horrified. Nikolai too suddenly seems almost ashamed that he has got this far. After a long silence Nikolai mumbles.

NIKOLAI (CONT'D) You tell the Russian desk you saw stars over my heart. OK? Tell them I'm through the door. 
A pause.   Yuri is still overwhelmed. 
YURI They are bound to ask... who did you kill? 
A pause. 
NIKOLAI (in Russian) Tell them I only killed myself. 
A pause. Yuri is humbled. They share a moment of understanding as they smoke. Finally... 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) And you can tell them I'm going to replace Semyon at the head of the London organization. 
Yuri laughs. 
YURI What drugs are they giving you? Maybe it's the anesthetic speaking. 
NIKOLAI I need you to take Semyon out of the picture. I want you to arrest him. 
Nikolai lights another cigarette from the stub of the one he is smoking. Yuri is incredulous. 
YURI Arrest him for what? 
NIKOLAI Rape. 
Yuri begins to chuckle. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) The girl was fourteen.

YURI (incredulous) And of course, she will testify... 
NIKOLAI She doesn't have to.   She's dead. 
A pause. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) But she had Semyon's baby. If you prove the baby is his and prove the girl was under age when the baby was conceived, that's statutory rape. 
A pause.   Yuri begins it think it through. 
NIKOLAI (CONT'D) All you need is the baby and some of Semyon's DNA. For poetic reasons I suggest you take his blood. 
Yuri peers at Nikolai with awe.    A long pause.   Finally Yuri smiles. 
YURI You intrigue me. 
A pause. 
YURI (CONT'D) If we had never had this conversation they would have sent you home. You could have spent the Spring in the mountains. Riding your bicycle to your office every morning through fields of flowers. 
A pause. 
YURI (CONT'D) Why stay? 
Nikolai reacts but doesn't answer. A pause. 
YURI (CONT'D) You keep in touch. 
Yuri studies Nikolai.

YURI (CONT'D) (in Russian) And take care, Mikhail. 
Yuri tenderly takes his overcoat from Nikolai's shoulders and goes back through the fire-escape door. Nikolai is left cold and exposed in his thin gown. 
86   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - DAY             86 
Nikolai is playing chess against himself, sitting on the bed, trying hard to concentrate. There is a knock and Anna enters, carrying an old shopping bag. She takes out a worn pair of jeans and a T-shirt, a denim jacket and a battered pair of shoes. Nikolai smiles...

Anna runs at breakneck speed through the corridors. 
97   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. CAR PARK - NIGHT                    97 
Kirill is at the wheel of Nikolai's Mercedes. He swigs from his bottle of vodka, which is now more than half empty. He fires the engine and reverses. A car passing by has to slam on its brakes. Kirill yells. 
KIRILL Hey, you stupid fucker!! 
A horn blows. The passing car accelerates angrily by. Then we hear a baby crying. Kirill looks into the half darkness of the back seat and we see Kirill's black sports bag, partially zipped up. Christine is crying inside it, her little grasping hand protruding past the zipper. Kirill speaks softly. 
KIRILL (CONT'D) Be quiet baby. Quiet baby.    It's OK. PINK Revision     -   11/12/06                         102. 
98   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD OUTSIDE NIKOLAI'S ROOM -        98 NIGHT 
Anna flies out of Nikolai's room and spots a nurse. 
ANNA What happened to the patient with the knife cuts? The Russian? 
NURSE We just discharged him.   A couple of minutes ago. 
Anna runs out. 
99   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. RECEPTION - NIGHT                    99 
Anna runs fast down the corridor towards the hospital exit. She spots Nikolai ahead of her. 
She pushes past a couple of drunks and flies at him. 
ANNA Where have they taken Christine?! 
Nikolai reacts. 
ANNA (CONT'D) You bastards!! Where will he take her?! Tell me!! 
People back away as Nikolai grabs Anna's arms and holds her still. 
NIKOLAI What are you talking about?! 
Anna studies Nikolai's face and sees his genuine confusion. She calms down a little. 
ANNA Kirill. Kirill has taken Christine. I saw him here! I thought he was coming to see you, but he wasn't, was he? 
Nikolai curses under his breath and thinks fast. 
NIKOLAI You brought your bike? BLUE Revision   -   11/4/06                            103. 
100    EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - NIGHT                        100 
The same dockside where Nikolai dumped Soyka and recommended this as the best place to dispose of a body. Kirill pulls up slowly in Nikolai's Mercedes. The car is parked for a long time before finally the headlights are switched off. 
101    EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. MATERNITY UNIT - NIGHT               101 
Nikolai and Anna race to Anna's motorbike. 
NIKOLAI I'll drive. 
ANNA I'll drive. 
Anna and Nikolai leap aboard the bike and it starts first time. With Nikolai riding pillion, they roar away. 
101A   EXT. LONDON STREET - NIGHT                                    101A 
Anna and Nikolai ride through London streets. 
102    EXT. NINE ELMS. ABANDONED DOCK - NIGHT                        102 
On the edge of the dockside, Kirill is kneeling with the zip-up bag before him. Suddenly fireworks begin to burst over the Thames. It is the stroke of midnight. 
Kirill unzips the bag. When he looks inside Christine stops crying. He peers at her, wiping away tears. 
KIRILL She's a little girl, Papa, a little sweet fucking girl... 
Kirill sobs then Christine cries... 
KIRILL (CONT'D) Shush, shush... 
Kirill lifts her out of the bag and holds her close to him, fireworks still illuminating the London skyline. He looks down at the freezing cold water, utterly confused. He whispers... 
KIRILL (CONT'D) (in Russian) I'm sorry, my little sister.

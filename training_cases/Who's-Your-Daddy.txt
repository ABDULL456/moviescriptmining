TED I genuinely think she wants me. I feel a vibe. 
CHARLIE That vibe is from your wrist, pal. You've been over-tenderizing your meat, again. 
Christy catches Ted's eye and smiles a perfect smile. 
TED See? Did you see that? 
CHARLIE She smiles at everyone, Ted.  She's like a newborn with gas. 
Charlie secretly shows Ted a nudie magazine. "HEAVEN." A GORGEOUS WOMAN with perfect breasts graces the cover. A golden halo over her head.  Charlie flips it open.  Points to a picture. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) The only chick more untouchable than Christy Malone is Miss April. (feminine voice) "Hi, my name's Ginger. I love tofu burgers, rainy nights, and riding bareback.  My biggest turn-off is cell phones during sex." Here's a tip:  set it on VIBRATE, honey, and don't be stingy with the lube. (winking at Ted) Don't knock it till you tried it. 
TED Were you always this sick? 
CHARLIE One thing for sure, Christy Malone ain't lookin THAT good naked. 
Ted takes a peek at Ginger.  Then at Christy. 
TED Someday, I'll find out. 
CHARLIE You have a better chance of being hit by a Mack truck with a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip. 
Ted grabs the magazine and flips through more pages. Beautiful, naked women.  Palm trees. Blue skies. Bubbling Jacuzzis. Red Ferraris. The stuff that fantasies are made of. Ted looks determined... 
TED I defy your hamburger theory of life, and all of the unfulfilled hopes and dreams it represents. 
CHARLIE That's crazy talk. 
TED I defy any and all limits. 
Charlie can see the look in Ted's eyes.  He's about to do something bold and daring. Something he'll regret. 
CHARLIE Don't do it, Ted. Don't do it. 
TED (walking away; defiantly) Any time, any day, a man can completely reinvent himself. 
Ted starts to walk across the corridor, ignoring Charlie... 
CHARLIE I'm warning you. This is an official warning. Danger, Will Robinson, danger. 
A quietly attractive teenaged girl, JULIE CONROY, watches Ted. She seems concerned, too. 
TED (V.O.) There's one more person you should meet. Someone integral to my story. 
FREEZE FRAME ON JULIE. 
TED (V.O.) That's Julie Conroy. Unlike the rest of these losers, she didn't grow up in Xenia, Ohio. I just met her that day. But already, she had made a difference in my life. 
INT. TEACHER'S LOUNGE - TECUMSEH HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Teachers mill around.  Chatting. Snacking on donuts, coffee. PRINCIPAL MERKIN bursts in, spilling a stack of "EXPOSED!" onto a table. Everyone freezes. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN Oh, Miss Pratt, Miss Pratt! What were you thinking?  How could you be so careless? (reading) "Exposing Hypocrisy in the Morons who Teach Us." That's the little bastard's motto! 
The teachers turn to MISS PRATT.  We recognize her from the cover of "EXPOSED!" 
MISS PRATT (summoning courage) Principal Merkin, I realize we have to teach the children that recreational drugs are the devil's work, but that doesn't mean we don't dance with the Prince of Darkness ourselves, every now and again. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN Ah, well, bravo!  That's just what we'll tell the school board. 
Suddenly, an AIR VENT pops open and CRASHES on top of a coffee machine.  THE WHOLE ROOM, IN SHOCKED SILENCE, turns to look at... 
JULIE, her head framed by the air duct.  She holds a digital camera in her hand. Her expression says: "Oh, shit." 
Principal Merkin narrows his eyes at the "little bastard" who has been making his life hell. 
INT. TED'S OFFICE - NEWSROOM - DAY 
Julie sits in a chair in front of Ted's desk. She and Ted size up one another. 
TED (V.O.) Merk's punishment was cruel. Expulsion without appeal. Or working for me on the school paper. The school paper would be torture for a gonzo reporter like Julie and we both knew it. But what choice did she have? 
Julie leans back on the chair, rests her feet on Ted's files, and blows a huge bubble. 
JULIE I tried to warn you, William Randolph. She's got stiletto heels hidden in those Keds. 
TED But you triple-dog-dared me. 
JULIE It was for your own good, in a twisted sort of publicly humiliating way. 
CHARLIE One word, my friend. One word. MEATLOAF. 
Ted lifts his head.  Looks in the mirror.  Distraught. 
TED There's gotta be more to life than meatloaf. 
INT. THE NELSON KITCHEN - EVENING 
Not a hair above middle class. Home sweet home nonetheless. Dinner in progress. MOM, DAD, Ted, younger brother, JIMMY. A mutt named CORKY curled under the table. A storm brews. Lightning in the distance. Thunder RUMBLES. 
Ted's Mom observes her son with unmistakable Mom-radar. She slides a slab of - rotten timing! - MEAT LOAF onto his plate with an unpleasant thud. Ted shudders... 
TED If I never eat another bite of meat loaf again, it'll be too soon. 
Ted's Mom frowns. Jimmy explains matter-of-factly. 
JIMMY Mom, Dad. Meatloaf has come to represent all that Ted hates about his mediocre life and the world we live in. He's what you'd call clinically bummed. 
TED Why can't we have pot roast or stroganoff or even a little London broil? I mean, for god's sake, we own a grocery store! 
Ted's parents look at one another, shake their heads. His Dad gently explains... 
DAD We heard about Christy, son. 
Jimmy tries to stifle a grin. 
TED What is this? Does everybody know everything I'm about to say or do every freakin' minute of the day? 
MOM No cursing in this house, young man. Use the strong vocabulary God gave you. 
TED I don't have a shred of privacy in this whole stupid town! 
DAD We understand your disappointment, Teddy. Christy is a pretty, sexy, provocative, voluptuous... (catches himself) We...uh...we understand your disappointment. 
TED It's my private business! Mine! 
MOM Can the tantrum, sweet pea. We're the good guys, remember? 
JIMMY Mom, Dad. Don't allow this disturbing behavior to furrow your collective brow. Ted's just experiencing some post-adolescent turmoil, coming to terms with the whole "small town dynamic." 
TED I hate Xenia! I hate my life! 
Ted charges for the front door... 
TED (V.O.) (CONT'D) And until that moment, this was the worst day of my seventeen and a half years. And then it happened. Three, two, one... 
EXT. NELSON HOUSE - EVENING 
Ted bursts outside and plows straight into MARTY ZUKERMAN, a short, rotund man in his mid-50s. 
TED Whoa! Sorry, mister. 
Zukerman's briefcase and papers are knocked to the ground. Ted helps to retrieve them. 
ZUKERMAN In a hurry, are we? 
TED I was in the middle of a melodramatic exit. It wouldn't really make a statement if I tiptoed out the door...What are you selling? 
ZUKERMAN Bad news. 
TED People pay good money for that? 
ZUKERMAN I'm just a messenger. 
Ted starts to back away. Instinctively knowing the bad news must be for him. 
TED Oh no. No way. I've had all the bad news I can take for one day. 
ZUKERMAN It's about your parents. 
DAD Son. 
TED Well, why should I? 
DAD They had a rough life. Your father was a bouncer. Your mother was, well, a two-bit stripper. There was no place for a baby. 
TED I guess. 
DAD They did do one great thing. They gave us our boy. 
TED Yeah. 
DAD Be a sport. How bad could spring break in Los Angeles be? 
TED I guess we could go to Disneyland or something. 
DAD Think of it as a rite of passage to manhood. 
TED Like one of those "National Geographic" specials with the topless chicks? 
DAD Whatever helps you cope. 
TED I guess it's better than having tribal patterns carved in my face. 
DAD There ya go. Always remember, focus on the peach... 
TED ...not the pit. 
Ted's Dad hugs him briefly, laughing... 
DAD Always one step ahead of your dear old dad. 
EXT. LAX - DAY 
A 747 lands screaming on the runway. 
INT. LAX - DAY 
Ted and Charlie exit the plane. They walk tentatively through the sleeve towards the entry gate. 
CHARLIE I wonder if this is what it feels like to be born? 
Ted gives him a look. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Think about it...Long tunnel, bright lights, it's full of vaginal symbolism. 
TED Poor Freud, turning in his grave. 
CHARLIE Seriously, it's like we're being reborn. We really could reinvent ourselves here, just like you said. Nobody knows about your massive humiliation. 
TED Nobody knows about your mental retardation. 
CHARLIE Nobody knows you barfed during junior high school graduation. 
TED Nobody knows about your constant masturbation. 
CHARLIE And nobody knows you're a virgin! (after a beat) Aw, who are we kidding... 
Charlie's words echo loudly through the sleeve... 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) ...EVERYBODY KNOWS YOU'RE A VIRGIN! 
People stare at Ted as they pass. 
TED I think I'll reinvent a new best friend. 
INT. LAX - TERMINAL - DAY 
Ted and Charlie enter the terminal.  Friends and family wait for loved ones.  A few chauffeurs hold signs with names.  One stands out.  Tall. Blonde. Gorgeous. In a short skirt. A matching low cut jacket.  And a cap.  She's stunning.  And she's holding a sign that reads: TED NELSON. 
CHARLIE What are the odds of there being ANOTHER Ted Nelson on our flight? 
TED Astronomical. 
They grin at one another. Then approach the Chauffeur. 
CHARLIE I'm Charles. The handsome, devoted best friend. We're so close, we feel each other's pain. 
The voluptuous beauty notices Charlie's soaked crotch. He winks... 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) See what you do to me, baby. 
Just then, the spry HELEN McDOLE, 60s, emerges from the mansion.  She approaches Ted and hugs him. 
HELEN Oh my, he would have been so proud. You're the spitting image of him. 
CHARLIE He never spits, ma'am. Ever. He can't even get a good hocker going. I've tried to teach him. It comes from the diaphragm. 
TED (sharply; to Charlie) You're on the next plane home. 
HELEN (emotional embrace) I'm Helen McDole.  Your father's executive secretary. 
INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Ted takes a seat at the spacious conference table.  Helen sits on his right. Charlie sits on his left. 
Zukerman and two other IMPATIENT ATTORNEYS wait at the head of the table.  Finally Zukerman checks his watch and rises. 
ZUKERMAN We're running out of time. The kid's here. We don't need HIM. 
HELEN Perhaps we could be patient for just a moment or two longer? 
They all watch a WALL CLOCK. Seconds pass, slowly, slowly. Then suddenly Zukerman rises. 
ZUKERMAN What did the doctor say to the nurse as they watched something black and white and red in a blender? (a wry smile) No more patients. 
Very dramatically, Zukerman slides a copy of "Heaven" magazine down the conference table. Right to Ted. 
ZUKERMAN (CONT'D) Are you familiar with "Heaven?" 
TED I'm seventeen. I know it like the back of my hand. 
ZUKERMAN Your fathered owned the entire "Heaven" empire.  You own it now. Any questions? 
Ted's stunned, speechless. Charlie gawks. 
CHARLIE Everything?  The publishing division, the real estate holdings, the retail outlets, the theme parks? 
ZUKERMAN As far as the eye can see. 
Zukerman presses a remote control.  A wall panel slides open to reveal a large monitor which springs to life.  On the screen is a striking couple.  Ted'S BIOLOGICAL PARENTS. HEATHER and TOM DEEDS. Heather, stunningly sexy and overflowing from her gold sequined halter top. Tom, very handsome in a Vegas showman sort of way. 
HEATHER Oh, sweetheart! We wish we could be right there to hug the living daylights out of you! 
TOM But if you're watching this, then it means we bit the dust. 
HEATHER But don't worry...we'll be in heaven. The REAL heaven, I mean. Not that heaven is an actual place, but more like a state of being. Or not being. Who knows. Maybe we know now. 
TOM If you're anything like yours truly, then you probably figure we didn't want you when you were born, so who cares if we're dead? Am I right? 
Ted looks guilty. This is too weird. 
HEATHER But we did want you. It's just that you don't always get to keep what you want. We knew you needed a real mom and dad. 
TOM We had no idea the nudie magazine we started in the garage would turn into all this. 
Heather holds up the first issue of "Heaven." She's on the cover, wearing nothing but a halo. She looks almost exactly the same today, with a few extra nips and tucks. 
HEATHER Can you believe that was me? 
TOM Before we knew it, we created the most popular men's magazine in the entire nation. The rest is history. 
HEATHER So here we are. Dead. But we never want you to want for anything. That is, we want you to have everything. 
TOM Everything. 
Heather leans forward and blows a kiss into the camera. Her strongest assets spilling forward. 
HEATHER We love you, Ted. We always did. We always will. 
Charlie's practically slobbering. He elbows Ted. 
UNCLE BILLY Hello, girls! Have you met Ted? 
The women wave, ad-libbing warm greetings. Charlie leans towards Ted, confiding... 
CHARLIE This is like my every wet dream come true.  I don't even care that you're here, too, bro. 
TED Be cool. Fake it if you have to. 
UNCLE BILLY Good advice, Ted. You have your father's instincts. 
"His father." The words sound so strange. He never even met the guy. 
UNCLE BILLY (CONT'D) Just remember, you're not the man you were a day ago. And these girls, let's just say they'd be eager to please you. 
Ted gulps. It's hard to believe this is real. 
CHARLIE I wonder how many of them will be at the orgy tonight? 
TED This isn't some 80's porno film, you dip shit. There are no wild sex orgies. 
CHARLIE Oh. Well. Maybe not yet. 
TED Not ever. Never. 
UNCLE BILLY Never say never. 
CHARLIE Oh, god.  Look. Look. 
Ted looks.  A beautiful woman sensuously rubs tanning lotion over her OWN breasts.  The boys stare, riveted. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I really love your peaches, wanna shake your tree. 
Uncle Billy grins. 
UNCLE BILLY Maybe she needs help, Ted. You should be a gentleman. 
TED (voice cracking) I...uh...I think she's doing fine on her own. 
CHARLIE (having a moment) Oh baby, yes, yes, yes. Fuck me like you mean it. 
Ted elbows Charlie out of his fantasy. 
TED You kiss your mother with that mouth? 
CHARLIE I'd kiss your mother with this mouth. I mean, if she wasn't, you know... 
He means dead. 
TED So far away? In Xenia? 
CHARLIE Yeah, whatever. 
INT.  THE NELSON HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mom waits nervously for the phone to ring. 
MOM Teddy? Is that you? 
Dad hurries out of the bathroom, hiking up his pajamas. Mom speaks loudly, as if Ted's in Siberia. 
MOM (CONT'D) How are you, baby? Are you all right? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. TED'S BEDROOM - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT 
A palatial suite. Very Louis XIV.  Ted throws a sheet over a nude sculpture of his biological mother. While holding a cordless phone in the crook of his neck. 
TED I'm all right, Mom. I'm not in Siberia, you know. 
MOM Did you have a nice flight?  Are they taking good care of you? 
TED Yeah, I'm doing fine.  I have so much to tell you.  I don't even know where to begin. 
MOM Save it, honey.  We want to hear every detail when you get back, but we don't want you to run up Mr. Zukerman's phone bill. 
TED Oh, how inappropriate is that! 
CHARLIE Take a whiff of heaven. 
TED How would you like it if I did that to your mother's panties? 
CHARLIE I'd call you a sick, twisted fuck. But this is different.  She wasn't your mother mother-- 
TED Give me those! 
Ted grabs the panties just as Charlie pulls away, ripping them in half. Just then the door opens to reveal a very proper ENGLISH BUTLER. 
BUTLER I do apologize, sir. I heard a noise. 
Ted and Charlie awkwardly hide the panty halves behind their backs. 
TED We were just-- 
BUTLER --I completely understand, sir. I'll leave you to your business. Good night. 
The Butler leaves.  Ted glares at Charlie. Who shrugs. 
CHARLIE A couple of boys fighting over a pair of red silk panties is nothing compared to what he's seen. 
TED (sarcastic) Yeah, he's probably been serving cocktails, SO TO SPEAK, at the orgies. 
INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GARAGE - THE NEXT MORNING 
The garage is crowded with two dozen sporty classics. Ted runs his hands over the hood of a red Ferrari 575M Maranello. He pulls the door open and slides into the leather seat. 
GINGER (O.S.) Wanna take me for a ride? 
Ted turns around and spots Ginger, the goddess from the pool, making her way towards him.  He gulps. 
TED I-I don't have the keys. 
GINGER They're in the ignition, silly. 
Ted glances down. There they are. She hops in next to him. He doesn't know what to do. 
GINGER (CONT'D) You do know how to drive? 
TED I don't have much experience with a...uh...stick. 
GINGER Want a lesson? 
Ted blushes. He needs a lot of lessons. 
GINGER (CONT'D) Press your left foot on the clutch. And turn the key. 
The Ferrari growls to life. Ginger places her hand over Ted's. 
GINGER (CONT'D) Now release the brake. And slide the stick into first gear. 
TED Got it. 
Ginger moves her slender fingers on his knees. Showing him how it's done. 
GINGER Now very carefully apply some pressure to the gas pedal with your right foot as you release the clutch with your left. 
She squeezes his thigh and winks. 
EXT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - GARAGE - DAY 
The Ferrari jerks out of the garage and promptly stalls. Ginger giggles.  Could Ted be MORE embarrassed? 
GINGER The first time can be awkward. You just have to get on and try again. 
TED I don't even know if I should be doing this. It's a very expensive car. 
GINGER It's your car. These are all your cars. 
TED Some of them have to be automatics. 
GINGER Your father liked shifting. He said it brought him closer to the engine. "Like a woman, purring with ecstasy." 
"HEAVEN" WAR ROOM 
POLAROIDS OF NAKED WOMEN cover every square inch of wall space.  Ted and Charlie gawk.  Who can blame them? 
UNCLE BILLY Every one of these women thinks she should be the next Angel of the Month. It's your job, Ted, to decide which of them is right. 
CHARLIE Let me get this straight... 
UNCLE BILLY If it isn't straight by now, son, you probably should see a doctor. 
CHARLIE These are real, live women? 
UNCLE BILLY (winking at Ted) We don't generally feature blow-up dolls in our magazine. But hey, if you think there's a market for it. 
CHARLIE God, I love being dead. 
Ted focuses on one particular picture. He removes the push pin that holds it to the wall. 
TED I like her. 
We can see the concerned look on Helen's face. Does this kid have any taste at all? 
HELEN (relieved) Nice choice. There's only one problem. 
She shows Uncle Billy. 
UNCLE BILLY You think she upgraded? 
HELEN They went in through the belly button. 
Uncle Billy nods. He explains gently... 
UNCLE BILLY We don't allow TIPN, Ted. 
TED Tipping? 
HELEN TIPN. Tattoos, implants, piercings, nose jobs. Our angels must be pure, unadultered, completely natural. 
Ted looks at the walls again. Carefully. He has a knack for this. He hands a picture to Helen. She turns to Uncle Billy and smiles. 
HELEN (CONT'D) (emotional) You have your father's eye. 
His father. He just can't get used to that. Who was this guy? 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM CLOSET - "HEAVEN" MANSION - NIGHT 
Ted looks at the impressive collection of suits. Runs his hands along the fabrics. Picks a particularly stylish jacket and tries it on. It fits poorly. Too big in the chest and shoulders. Ted looks at himself in the full-length mirror. He's not half the man his father was. 
Suddenly there's a KNOCK on the door. Ted quickly takes off his father's jacket and puts on his own. He lets Uncle Billy in.  LOUD PARTY SOUNDS momentarily pour into the room. 
UNCLE BILLY There you are, Ted-baby. Everything all right? 
TED Yeah.  Everything's cool. 
Ted's struggling with a silk tie. Uncle Billy helps him. 
UNCLE BILLY You ready for your big coming out party? Everybody's dying to meet you. 
TED Just a couple of finishing touches. My parents always said you never get a second chance to make a good first impression. 
UNCLE BILLY (puzzled) They said that? Really? (realizing) Oh, your parents. The Nelson's. Right, right. How midwest. I like that. 
Ted wipes his palms on his slacks. Confiding... 
TED Truth is, I'm a little nervous. 
UNCLE BILLY YOU? Nervous? Why on earth should you be nervous? 
TED All those people out there. It's a lot of pressure. 
UNCLE BILLY Huh! You laugh in the face of pressure! 
TED I do? 
UNCLE BILLY You are a multi-media magnate. The Tycoon of Tits. The Baron of Bottoms. 
A beautiful spring morning.  Cars pull into the school parking lot.  Students mingle in small groups. Making their way into the building.  A group of GUYS look up. 
Suddenly, a helicopter swooshes through the air, circling the school as if to get everyone's attention, then landing on a grassy knoll. The helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a pattern of white billowy clouds. 
The door slides open and out hops Ted. In SLOW-MO. Looking seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his stylish Persol shades.  Until he takes a second step and stumbles slightly, catching himself from falling face first into the grass. 
Charlie is right behind him. Looking great, too, but vaguely Mafioso in his efforts to be hip. He turns to the beautiful blonde PILOT and plants a big wet kiss for everyone to see. 
Ted and Charlie strut towards the school as Principal Merkin bursts through the front doors, shouting... 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN You cannot land a helicopter in my school yard! Get that blasted thing out of here! 
Ted raises his hand.  The chopper rises as if on cue. Without a word, Ted and Charlie pass the ruffled Principal Merkin and strut toward the entrance. Classmates surround Ted.  Congratulating him.  Everyone wanting to be Ted's new best friend.  Julie walks up to Charlie. 
JULIE What gives, Don Corleone? 
CHARLIE (smug) We reinvented ourselves. 
JULIE New Hushpuppies don't make a new man. 
CHARLIE You've obviously never had your dogs nestled in thousand dollar Italian loafers. 
JULIE That explains the emptiness that haunts me. 
CHARLIE Jealousy is so unattractive. 
Ted makes eye contact with Julie. Winking like he's Don Juan. She just stares at him, blankly. 
JULIE Second only to unfettered arrogance and the inability to see the irony therein. 
Charlie's baffled by that one. 
CHARLIE Wanna see my hickey from Miss December? 
Julie groans. 
INT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Principal Merkin paces dramatically... 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich. 
TED Thanks, Principal Merkin. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN I'll be blunt. I know you can take it. 
TED Yes, sir. I'll brace myself. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you. 
TED You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire? 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN That's a good start, yes. A very good start. 
TED Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN I never figured you for a pimp. 
TED Have you ever even looked at "Heaven?" 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing. 
TED I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then? 
Principal Merkin opens his desk drawer sheepishly. Caresses the watch. It kills him to return it. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN No. No, I won't. Thank you. For reminding me. 
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY 
Flurry of activity. Ted on his cell phone. Julie types furiously. Taking her job very seriously. Christy Malone props one leg against the wall. Demonstrating those contortionist warm-up moves that drove Ted mad with desire. 
CHRISTY Great jacket, Teddy Bear. 
TED (hanging up phone) Yeah? You like? 
MOM Your Dad and I were raised with a certain work ethic, that's all. 
Julie listens closely, admiring Ted's parents. 
DAD We can't start living like we're the Rockerfellers or something. 
JIMMY Mom, Dad. The Rockerfellers are paupers compared to my favorite brother, Ted. 
TED You don't have to work another day in your lives. 
MOM But how would we pay our bills? 
DAD We just barely have enough for your college tuition, son. 
Ted's frustration mounts. 
TED Don't you get it? In one day I earn more interest than the store's entire annual revenue. 
MOM Oh. Goodness. 
TED You're free.  You can do anything you ever wanted to do! 
MOM (after a beat) Like what? 
TED Like take that trip to Buckingham Palace. Go deep sea fishing in the Gulf of Mexico. Now's your chance. 
DAD But those are our dreams, son. We have to make them come true. 
TED Consider me your fairy godfather, except without the fairy part. No more mealy apples and bruised bananas, ever, for the rest of your lives. 
MOM But who would run the store? 
TED Forget the store. Think big. 
Dad looks at Mom. Forget the store. That stings. 
DAD Ted, we put a lot of love in our business. 
MOM We wanted you and Jimmy to have it someday. Something real and honest. 
DAD We love our lives just the way they are. 
Disappointed, disgusted, Ted looks to Julie for support. Tears fill her eyes. Mom and Dad moved her. Ted shrugs and digs into his food. 
EXT. ABOVE THE CLOUDS - DAY 
A heavenly blue jet with billowy white clouds soars through the sky. 
INT. THE "HEAVEN" JET - DAY 
Beyond first class; the ultimate in posh. Charlie sweet-talks a sexy FLIGHT ATTENDANT. 
CHARLIE Call me Charlie. I'm a photographer for "Heaven" magazine. And a very cunning linguist. 
The Flight Attendant pulls him toward the washroom, quickly. 
Julie interviews Ted, complete with tape recorder. 
TED I have to admit, I always felt... different. 
JULIE Different how? Different like a dwarf at a basketball game? Or different like a lesbian in pumps? 
TED I don't get the distinction. 
JULIE Could everybody else tell you were different, or were you the only one who knew? 
TED I felt limited. I felt confined. I felt like I was suffocating. 
JULIE I see. So more like a tight rope walker who secretly wants to be a trapeze artist. 
TED I guess. 
JULIE Interesting. 
Another FLIGHT ATTENDANT approaches... 
JULIE You've got enough people kissing your ass. 
Ginger returns with a rose. 
GINGER Here you go, cutie patootie. Rich guys always wear flowers. 
Julie gives Ted a look. See what I mean. 
INT. THE TONIGHT SHOW SET - DAY 
Jay Leno seems charmed.  Ted behaves as if he does this every day. The rose from Ginger is pinned to his lapel. 
JAY How are the hometown folks treating you, back in Xenia? 
TED Well, Jay. They've been exceptionally supportive. 
JAY Are they hitting you up for donations? Asking you to sponsor the local quilting bee? 
Audience LAUGHS. 
TED I'm no stranger to the notion of philanthropy. Andrew Carnegie has long been one of my idols. 
JAY What about the future? You planning to rock the boat at all? Stir things up in "Heaven?" 
Ted's so smooth. We know it's still HIM under all that Armani, but it sure does make him LOOK different. 
TED Matter of fact, Jay, my uncle and I are planning to rethink the magazine. To expand the traditional western notions of "beauty." 
JAY I see, so you'd be open to little ladies from Pasadena, who want to show you their knickers? 
TED Matter of fact, Jay, I'm planning a pictorial focusing on the women of my hometown, "The Girls of Xenia." Just to show my appreciation. 
OFF IN THE WINGS 
Julie looks thoroughly disgusted. 
JULIE The Girls of Xenia? Jesus. 
BACK TO STAGE 
JAY Now you're talking. What did Andrew Carnegie ever do? Open a couple of libraries? BOR-ING. 
INT. PRINCIPAL MERKIN'S KITCHEN - MORNING 
A Cocker Spaniel, POOCHIE, sits under a breakfast table, holding a newspaper in his snout. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN (O.S.) Poochie?  Where's my poochie? Where is she? 
MRS. MERKIN, dressed in a bathrobe and curlers, prepares breakfast.  Their beautiful college-aged daughter, JUDY, eats cereal at the table, while flipping through a glamour magazine. Principal Merkin enters. Ready for work. Wife and daughter don't even look up. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) Is my Poochie in here? 
Principal Merkin pretends to look for the dog in the cupboard. This is obviously a daily ritual. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) Is she in here?  No.  Where on earth could she be? 
He looks under the table. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) There's my Poochie!  There's my girl! 
The dog leaps into his arms.  Principal Merkin grabs the paper as Poochie starts to lick his face. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) Poochie loves Daddy, doesn't she? 
MRS. MERKIN Breakfast is getting cold. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN Thank you, dear. 
MRS. MERKIN No dogs at the table. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN I know, dear. 
Principal Merkin places the dog on the ground, takes a seat, and bites into a breakfast sausage.  He opens the paper and is confronted by a full page ad. 
CLOSE ON NEWSPAPER AD 
JUDY I'm an adult. I can do whatever I want. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN My roof, my rules, young lady. 
He grabs her arm while knocking the stack of flyers out of Charlie's hands.  As Principal Merkin drags her away, Judy smiles back at Charlie.  He winks. 
CHARLIE Send us a picture, sugar.  We'll get back to you. 
The stack of flyers FLOATS over the railing and onto the ground floor, just as a group of LOVELY YOUNG WOMEN enters the building lobby. They excitedly reach for the flyers. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN BUILDING - XENIA - DAY 
A line of BEAUTIFUL WOMEN - all shapes and sizes - snakes around the block and into a doorway.  The women are dressed to impress, in very skimpy clothing. Ted pulls up in his convertible Ferrari. The women shout greetings as Ted heads for the door. 
INT. BUILDING CORRIDOR - DAY 
We follow Ted as he dashes up the stairs, along the line of women, towards an office. 
TED (greeting the women) Hello there...Looking great...Very nice. 
Charlie looks frazzled. 
CHARLIE You're late, bro! 
TED Sorry. Ginger got a little, you know, enthusiastic. 
CHARLIE You'll never believe who's in there. 
TED It better not be my Aunt Trudy. 
They enter... 
INT. TED'S OFFICE - DAY 
A YOUNG WOMAN sits with her back to the door. 
TED Sorry to keep you waiting... 
The woman turns towards Ted, revealing herself to be Christy Malone.  Ted is momentarily stunned. 
CHRISTY Hi, Teddy Bear. 
TED Christy?  You want to be in "Heaven?" 
CHRISTY I turned eighteen over spring break. I'm eligible. 
Ted doesn't know what to say. Charlie's equally stunned. Hell, it seems, has frozen over. 
TED I feel like I've just been hit by a Mack truck. 
CHARLIE With a refrigerated cargo bed full of sirloin tip. 
INT. TED'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Highly modified since the last time we saw it. A large flat screen hangs on the wall.   A high tech computer system for video conferences dominates the room.  Ted speaks with Uncle Billy and Helen. 
UNCLE BILLY So far, so good. Some of them have real Angel potential. 
TED Really? So I'm doing OK? 
HELEN We're impressed but not surprised, Ted. You have your father's impeccable judgment. 
Dad passes the partially open door. Overhearing. He stops. 
TED My father must've been amazing. 
UNCLE BILLY He was in a league of his own. 
Suddenly Ted feels his dad's presence, behind him. 
DAD Sorry I-- 
TED It's okay. You need me? 
DAD (holding a list) Your mom said you've been ignoring your chores. 
TED Whatever you want. 
WE notice Christy Malone dancing with her FOOTBALL CAPTAIN DATE. The perfect male specimen. Christy gives Ted a disappointed, longing gaze. But he's oblivious. 
GINGER I bet St. Tropez in July would be paradise. For a honeymoon. 
Suddenly a FLASH blinds them. It's Julie Conroy, doing her job.  Following her subject. 
GINGER (CONT'D) (snapping) You could have warned us. 
JULIE Oops, sorry. Warning: You've got lipstick on your teeth. 
Julie flashes the camera again. Capturing Ginger's panicked expression. We notice that Julie looks alluring in a deep purple strapless gown. Not so glamorous as Ginger, but far more appealing and natural. 
TED Wow...you clean up nice. 
JULIE Put your eyeballs back in your head, William Randolph. I'm on assignment. A girl has to fit in. 
Ginger seems testy and jealous. Her true colors emerging. 
GINGER Teddy, I thought we were having a moment here. 
TED Of course we were. 
Suddenly the music dies.  Everyone turns to the stage where Principal Merkin stands proudly. Holding a power cord. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN I apologize for interrupting the festivities, but I have some good news. I've been reviewing the rules and regulations set forth by the superintendent of schools. And it seems quite clear... (reading from manual) "Minors may not be accompanied to school functions by adults unless they are their parents or legal guardians." 
A spotlight suddenly finds Ted and Charlie's beautiful dates. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) So long, ladies. Prom's over. 
The crowd boos, hisses. 
TED Honestly, Merk. It's like you were never seventeen and the head of a media empire. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN Rules are rules. 
TED Come on, it's our only senior prom. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN Deaf ears, Mr. Nelson. I answer to a higher power. 
Charlie steps in like a hostage negotiator. 
CHARLIE Here's the deal, Merk.  Forget the "rules and regulations" malarkey and we'll give you seven minutes in heaven with the Taylor Triplets. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN Out! Now! 
Ted realizes his high school reputation is at stake. He steps up on stage. Approaches Principal Merkin. Takes out his wallet. 
TED What's your price, Merk? How much will it cost to make you go bye bye? 
The crowd CHEERS. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN You're crossing the line, Mr. Nelson. 
TED A statue in front of city hall, dedicated to Principal Dick Merkin? 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN I'm warning you. 
TED A new pediatric wing at the hospital? A presidential campaign? Name it. Anything. 
Principal Merkin trembles from the sheer temptation of it. Yet he could never succumb in front of so many witnesses. He has to maintain his dignity... 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN That's it! You're out of here! 
From nowhere, a flock of beefy SECURITY GUARDS emerge to remove Ted & Co. 
PRINCIPAL MERKIN (CONT'D) Good-bye, Mr. Nelson.  Have a pleasant evening. 
The Marilyn Manson clone is rapidly whisked away, and replaced by six GEEZERS in powder blue tuxedoes. 
As Security Guards carry them away... 
GINGER Ted! Do something! 
EXT. HOLIDAY INN - NIGHT 
Drunken teenagers pour out of the building.  Dashing for their cars and limos.  Ted's among them.  Suddenly he's cut off by a Harley that stops right in front of him.  It's Julie.  Still in her purple strapless prom dress. With a black motorcycle jacket over it. 
JULIE Need a lift? 
Ted jumps on, wrapping his arms around her waist. Julie takes off. 
EXT. STREETS OF XENIA - CONTINUOUS 
Julie maneuvers the nighttime streets of Xenia, taking off 
down a country road. 
TED (V.O.) Where are we going? 
JULIE (V.O.) To the best hiding place in the world. 
EXT. JULIE'S BACKYARD - NIGHT 
Now we understand. Julie's family comes from major bucks. The yard is massive. And resting in a sprawling oak tree is the best hiding place in the world. 
INT. JULIE'S TREE HOUSE - NIGHT 
A cozy oasis. Books everywhere.  A whole series of flashlights hang upside down like lanterns. Giving the tree house a warm glow. 
TED I can't believe your dad built this for you. 
JULIE He didn't. He had it built. 
TED Whatever. 
JULIE Not "whatever."  It's two different things. 
TED He cared enough to want you to have it. 
JULIE He phoned it in. 
TED I see. 
JULIE I doubt it. 
TED Now it makes sense, the whole neo Bohemian, down with hypocrisy, fight the power crap. You're a poor little rich girl. 
JULIE The ozone must be fully depleted on Planet Ted. 
TED You think my dad would have been like that if I knew him? You think he would have bought me a stadium, instead of teaching me how to play ball? 
JULIE Your dad taught you everything. 
TED I mean my father. 
JULIE A father is nothing but sperm, Ted. It takes a real man to be a dad. 
TED It's all so complicated. 
JULIE It's incredibly simple. 
TED I feel like I'm being drawn and quartered. Like every part of me is being pushed and pulled and tugged in a different direction. 
JULIE Eventually you'll let go. 
TED And then what? 
JULIE Then you'll see who's really holding on to you. 
TED You're amazing. 
JULIE I know. 
TED Even when you infuriate me, I still want to kiss you. 
JULIE But you never do. 
TED If we were a team, we could do anything. I mean, anything. 
But Molly pulls off her panties and flings them at him. 
INT. TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - DESK AREA - THAT NIGHT 
Uncle Billy chortles, his image glowing on a large flat screen monitor that hangs on the wall.  Ted leans back in his chair. 
TED I never saw anybody turn so many shades of red. 
UNCLE BILLY I can't wait to see the pictures. 
TED It was incredible. The light, the crowd, everything. 
Uncle Billy grins proudly at Ted. 
UNCLE BILLY Such enthusiasm. Have I told you lately how proud I am of you? 
TED Seriously? I'm doing all right? 
UNCLE BILLY You're taking this bull of an empire by the horns, but you're still keeping your small town values. You're not letting all this "stuff" spoil you. 
Ted knows it's not true. He looks guilty. 
TED I owe it all to you. Without your help I'd be lost. 
UNCLE BILLY I wish I knew you years ago, when my brother was alive. I wish he never gave you up. 
TED Yeah, well, like my Grandpa used to say...you can't change your Christmas past, but you sure can exchange your Christmas presents. 
Uncle Billy forces a laugh. 
UNCLE BILLY Why don't you come to town this weekend? We could play some golf, chase some skirts. 
Ted smiles at the appealing offer. 
TED I'd love to, but I really need to crack the books.  Final exams are coming up and I've been slacking. 
UNCLE BILLY You're right. I should work, too. Our first issue together is almost ready to print. 
TED Thanks, Uncle Billy. Thanks for everything. 
UNCLE BILLY You're a great kid. Don't you forget it. 
With that, he's gone. The room is completely silent. And Ted is completely alone. 
UNTIL the doorbell CHIMES. 
TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - ENTRY WAY - NIGHT 
Ted opens the door. It's Jimmy, with his shiny new bike. 
TED James, what are you doing here? 
JIMMY You can call me Jimmy again. Sheryl Petersen said James sounds too pretentious. 
TED Sheryl Petersen is, what, nine years old, what does she know? 
JIMMY She knew exactly where you were staying, which you neglected to tell me, your own brother. 
TED It's really late...do your parents know where you are? 
JAMES Mom and Dad think I'm tucked safely in bed and that's all they need to know. Will this discussion be continuing in the hallway, or somewhere slightly more inviting? 
TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM 
Jimmy seems impressed by the opulence. He takes off his bike helmet, looks around. 
JIMMY Impressive. This is bigger than our whole house. 
TED Most places are, Jimmy. 
JIMMY They say money can't buy happiness but this is a reasonably good facsimile. 
TED So, what brings you here at his hour? 
JIMMY My new bike. 
TED'S LUXURIOUS HOTEL SUITE - LIVING ROOM - THAT MOMENT 
Ted hangs up the phone.  Looks around.  Jimmy's gone. But his SHINY NEW BIKE is left behind. 
INT. CINCINNATI NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 
Not much of a place. A middle-aged TORCH SINGER croons "MY ROMANCE."  Ted and Julie find their way to corner table. Keeping an eye out for Principal Merkin. 
TED I don't know. This place seems pretty tame. 
JULIE You expected whips, chains, Merk being cattle-prodded by some dominatrix in a leather hood? 
TED At least it's not another 4-H meeting or a Big Brother barbecue. 
JULIE Amen to that. 
Their heads are very close together. A conspiratorial tête-à tête. 
TED Look at us. It's one o'clock in the morning, on a school night. We're in a smoky nightclub, hoping to catch our principal with some big city tart. 
JULIE I'm trembling with excitement. 
TED That has more to do with your proximity to me. 
JULIE (playing along) My desire betrays me, like goosebumps on my flesh. 
TED I have a bit of a goosebump fetish. Not many people know that. 
JULIE I figured you for more of a hairy armpit guy. 
TED Shoes, if you want to know the truth. Shoes are my thing. 
JULIE Wearing them?  Or humping them? 
TED My fantasy is a totally naked woman, wearing nothing but a Timex and suede clogs. 
JULIE That's refreshingly deviant. 
TED What about you? 
JULIE I'm very aural. 
TED Tell me more. 
JULIE Sounds, voices, music, humming. All of it can turn me on, or off, like a switch. 
TED (feigning a deep voice) I see. 
JULIE I had a Portuguese boyfriend who could read the phone book and melt me. 
TED (jealous) A Portuguese boyfriend. Sounds very "Cosmo." 
JULIE You live and learn. I realized the most important thing to me, above all, is trust. 
TED Turned out to be a scoundrel, eh? I saw that one coming. 
JULIE You lose trust in someone and it's over, done, gone, forever. 
At that moment, the TORCH SINGER begins crooning "PEOPLE." 
TED Do you trust me, Julie? 
JULIE Not a chance. 
TED Come on. 
JULIE Trust is something you earn, over time. You don't just inherit it overnight like a gazillion dollar empire. 
Ted leans even closer. Looking into her eyes. Using his voice. Being as aurally seductive as he can. 
TED I want you to trust me. 
JULIE Maybe someday. 
TED Julie, I'll tell you something that is the god's honest truth. I've seen a lot of really beautiful girls. I mean a lot. But none of them make me feel like you do. 
UNCLE BILLY The kid came up with something that sounded good on paper. Who knew our readers wouldn't dig it? 
Ted bristles. THE KID?  The kid came up with something? 
HEAD OF MARKETING We tried to warn you. 
UNCLE BILLY Sometimes young people need to make their own mistakes. That's how they learn. 
Ted can see that Uncle Billy's playing this out differently than he imagined. Giving Ted all the "credit." 
TED (firmly; to Uncle Billy) It won't happen again. It will never happen again. 
INT. "HEAVEN" MANSION - TED'S OFFICE - DAY 
Ted sits at his father's desk.  Going through paperwork. Figures.  Charts. Reports. CEO work.  In the b.g., he hears the PLAYFUL SOUNDS of women.  Which distract him. 
Ted approaches the window and watches a group of girls splashing and playing in the pool. He looks sad. Helen enters behind him.  He turns to her. 
TED I always thought I wanted fame and fortune and beautiful women. But sometimes your dreams come true, and they cause you nothing but grief. I just want to chuck everything and sell the stupid magazine. It's not worth the pain. 
Helen takes Ted's hand, comfortingly. 
HELEN Come, let me show you something. 
INT. MANSION ATTIC - DAY 
Helen and Ted sit on old trunk. Helen holds a scrapbook in her arms. Explaining to Ted... 
HELEN Your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, Ted. They knew your Mom and Dad loved you very much. They knew they did the right thing. But that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar. 
TED You mean they knew who I was? 
HELEN They kept this scrapbook of your life. It meant the world to them. 
CLOSE ON SCRAPBOOK 
We see baby pictures of Ted, taken through the glass of a nursery. A newspaper photo of Ted playing a donkey in a nativity play. And clippings from Ted's high school newspaper. 
TED I wondered about them, for so many years. I wondered if I looked like them, acted like them. I wondered why they gave me up. 
HELEN Giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. When they founded "Heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. All they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours. 
TED My legacy. 
HELEN Your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it. 
TED They're not my parents, Helen. My parents are back in Xenia and I hurt them very much. 
HELEN I understand. 
TED And the girl I love, she hates "Heaven." If I keep it, she'll never respect me. 
HELEN But how can you respect yourself if you don't? 
INT. NELSON LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Ted's parents and Jimmy walk through the front door. They're stunned to find a huge 24x36 enlarged family portrait, hanging over the mantle. It's the same picture Ted broke in his childish tantrum. Mom and Dad are moved. Even more so when they see Ted. Waiting for them on the couch.  Ted rises. Misty eyed. 
TED Everything I am is because of you. Can you ever forgive me? 
MOM (hugging him) Oh, Teddy. We missed you so much. 
DAD You were always our number one son. 
JIMMY (rolling his eyes) Mom, Dad. This display of unconditional love is appalling. 
MOM We are a FAMILY. 
JIMMY A family, need I remind you, that HE ridiculed and left for dead. 
TED Shut your pie hole, Jimmy. 
DAD I will not have my boys arguing. 
JIMMY So, when I'm seventeen, can I turn everyone's life upside-down, behave like a total piece of canine excrement, and then wipe the slate clean with a half-baked apology and a Kodak moment? 
CLOSE ON MAGAZINE 
We see a special dedication, "To Julie, My Partner in Crime, With All the Love in the World." Julie's eyes fill with tears. She flips ahead to "The Girls of Xenia" pictorial, only to find-- 
Principal Merkin. Singing his heart out, in drag as Barbra Streisand. It's a series of shots from the Cincinnati nightclub. Other shots suggestively include him with Molly in the foreground, as if they posed together. 
JULIE Not bad for a hack. He has a future in yellow journalism. 
CHARLIE He kicked major ass and you know it. 
INT. MERKIN'S HONDA CIVIC - MOVING - DAY 
Principal Merkin drives. The RADIO plays in the b.g. As one song ends, we hear the DJ say... 
DJ This one's for you Dick Merkin of Tecumseh High. From all your students. With hugs and kisses. 
The voice of Barbra Streisand fills the car. 
BARBRA STREISAND (ON THE RADIO) "People/People who need People/Are the luckiest people in the world." 
Principal Merkin pales.  He turns off the radio.  But somehow, he can still hear the song.  As he pulls into the school parking lot, students wave enthusiastically.  He waves back tentatively.  Anxiety rising. 
EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY 
Principal Merkin swings open his car door to be greeted by the sound of Barbra singing her heart out through the parking lot. Every student's car stereo blasts the song. Students CHEER. Chanting:  "BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA, BAR-BRA!"  Principal Merkin turns crimson. 
EXT. SCHOOL STADIUM - DAY 
Graduation caps fall all around. People hugging, laughing, overjoyed. Ted searches for Julie, but she's nowhere in sight. 
INT./EXT. NELSON'S HOUSE - EVENING 
A big graduation party in progress. But Ted sits in the corner, looking sad, dejected. Julie didn't show up. He blew it. Jimmy and Charlie approach, with cheering on their minds. 
JIMMY Why so melancholy? 
CHARLIE You were born naked, wet, and hungry. Now you're hip, handsome, and rich. You are the coxswain on the ship of life. 
JIMMY Eat, Drink, and Screw Mary! 
CHARLIE (proudly) I taught him that. 
TED Great. 
JIMMY From my wise, albeit youthful, vantage point, the world is your oyster. You scored big. 
CHARLIE You got everything you ever wanted. 
TED Except the girl. The only one that really mattered. 
JULIE (O.S.) And who might that be?  Miss July? Miss August? 
Ted turns to find Julie. His faces brightens with hope. 
TED Julie, wow. I was afraid you left. I was afraid I'd never see you again. 
JULIE I'm not going anywhere, Ted. You're the one with the champagne wishes and caviar dreams. 
TED I decided to let Helen run the magazine. I need to go to college, learn a few things, you know. 
Julie seems pleased. 
TED (CONT'D) And I thought maybe I'd take up boating. I've always wanted to be a "coxswain." 
JULIE Very ambitious. I like that. 
TED The thing is, I'll need a first mate. 
JULIE I know where you can find any number of naked girls who'd love to hop on board. 
All kidding aside, he speaks from the heart... 
TED Julie, you were right. All the naked girls in the world mean nothing. It's the one you want to cover up with your coat that you really love. 
Julie smiles...

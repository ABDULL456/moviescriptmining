INT: BEDROOM. EARLY-MORNING HOURS 
A DOG sleeps on a neatly made bed. 
A CLOCK reads twenty to six. 
A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno, Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his back to the camera, phone in hand. 
FIGURE (groggily) Hello...What?...No, I don't work today...I'm playing hockey at two. 
THE DOG yawns and shakes its head. 
FIGURE (O.C.) Why don't you call Randal?... Because I'm fucking tired....I just closed last night.... (deep sigh) Jesus...What time are you going to come in?...Twelve...Be there be twelve?...Swear... 
A PICTURE OF A GIRL leans against a trophy. The picture is decorated with a Play-Doh beard and mustache. 
FIGURE (O.C.) Swear you'll be in by twelve and I'll do it....Twelve...Twelve or I walk. 
THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair and stands. 
THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is Dante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it. 
DANTE Next time, I get the bed. 
He releases the dog and sits up. 
DANTE (exhausted) Shit. 
CUT TO: 
INT: BATHROOM. MINUTES LATER 
A steaming shower fills the room. The dog licks water from the toilet. 
CUT TO: 
INT: KITCHEN. MINUTES LATER 
A towel-dressed DANTE opens the fridge and peers inside. He grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door. 
CUT TO: 
INT: KITCHEN. SECONDS LATER 
Chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. One scoop, two scoops, three scoops, four scoops. 
CUT TO: 
INT: BEDROOM. A MINUTE LATER 
DANTE gulps his breakfast while feeling inside the closet for some clothes. Some chocolate milk spills on the floor. THE DOG laps at the small puddle of chocolate milk. 
CUT TO: 
INT: HALLWAY. MINUTES LATER 
DANTE'S feet are hastily covered. A hand grabs keys from atop a VCR. 
CUT TO: 
EXT: DRIVEWAY. MINUTES LATER 
A car backs out of the driveway and speeds down the street. 
CUT TO: 
EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING 
The car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open. 
CUT TO: 
DANTE lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. He opens it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the store. 
CUT TO: 
INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING 
A very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the convenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a knife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack remains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot. Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls his eyes as it occurs to him. 
DANTE Shit. 
The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter.

EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. MORNING 
POV: NEWSPAPER MACHINE 
The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase. 
CUSTOMER What's this? 
ACTIVIST It's a trach ring. It's what they install in your throat when throat cancer takes your voice box. This one came out of a sixty-year-old man. 
CUSTOMER (drops ring) Unnhh! 
ACTIVIST (picks up the ring) He smoked until the day he died. Used to put the cigarette in this thing and smoke it that way. 
DANTE Excuse me, but... 
ACTIVIST This is where you're heading. A cruddy lung, smoking through a hole in your throat. Do you really want that? 
CUSTOMER Well, if it's already too late... 
ACTIVIST It's never too late. Give those cigarettes back now, and buy some gum instead. (grabs nearby pack, reads) Here. Chewlies Gum. Try this. 
CUSTOMER It's not the same. 
ACTIVIST It's cheaper than cigarettes. And it certainly beats this. 
Hands him a picture. 
CUSTOMER Jesus! 
ACTIVIST It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung. Keep it. 
CUSTOMER (to DANTE) I'll just take the gum. 
DANTE Fifty-five. 
ACTIVIST You've made a wise choice. Keep up the good work. 
The CUSTOMER exits. 
DANTE Maybe you should take that coffee outside. 
ACTIVIST No, I think I'll drink it in here, thanks. 
DANTE If you're going to drink it in here, I'd appreciate it if you'd not bother the customers. 
ACTIVIST Okay. I'm sorry about that. 
Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter. 
CUSTOMER Pack of cigarettes. (looks at model) What's that? 
ACTIVIST This? How long have you been smoking?

A blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB. 
JAY WE NEED SOME TITS AND ASS! YEAH! 
SILENT BOB lights a smoke. 
JAY I feel good today, Silent Bob. We're gonna make some money! And then you know what we're going to do? We're going to go to that party and get some pussy! I'm gonna fuck this bitch, that bitch... (Blue Velvet Hopper) I'LL FUCK ANYTHING THAT MOVES! 
SILENT BOB points to something off-screen. 
JAY (to O.C.) What you looking at?! I'll kick your fucking ass! (to SILENT BOB) Doesn't that motherfucker still owe me ten bucks? 
SILENT BOB nods. 
JAY Tonight, you and me are going off that fucker's head, and take out his fucking soul! Remind me if he tries to buy something from us, to cut it with leafs and twigs...or fucking shit in the motherfucker's bag! 
Some girls walk past. JAY smiles at them. 
JAY Wa sup sluts? (to SILENT BOB) Damn Silent Bob! You one rude motherfucker! But you're cute as hell. (slowly drops to knees) I wanna go down on you, and suckle you. (makes blow job neck-jerks) And then, I wanna line up three more guys, and make like a circus seal... 
JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys, looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly. 
JAY Ewwww!  You fucking faggot! I fucking hate guys! (yelling) I LOVE WOMEN! (calmer) Neh. 
A GUY comes up to them. 
GUY You selling? 
JAY (all business) I got hits, hash, weed, and later on I'll have 'shrooms. We take cash, or stolen MasterCard and Visa.

A SMALL CROWD gathers around the ACTIVIST as he orates. It has become something of a rally. 
ACTIVIST You're spending what? Twenty, thirty dollars a week on cigarettes. 
LISTENER 1 Forty. 
LISTENER 2 Fifty-three. 
ACTIVIST Fifty-three dollars. Would you pay someone that much money every week to kill you? Because that's what you're doing now, by paying for the so-called privilege to smoke! 
DANTE remains silent. 
VERONICA (sits beside him) Okay, champ. What's wrong? 
DANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look. 
VERONICA All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard? 
DANTE Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me! 
VERONICA At least they weren't lit. 
DANTE I hate this fucking place. 
VERONICA Then quit. You should be going to school anyway... 
DANTE Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point. 
VERONICA All I'm saying is that if you're unhappy you should leave. 
DANTE I'm not even supposed to be here today! 
VERONICA I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something. 
DANTE The guy got sick and couldn't come in. 
VERONICA Don't you have a hockey game at two? 
DANTE Yes! And I'm going to play like shit because I didn't get a good night's sleep! 
VERONICA Why did you agree to come in then? 
DANTE I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in. 
VERONICA Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here? 
DANTE Somebody jammed the locks with gum. 
VERONICA You're kidding. 
DANTE Bunch of savages in this town. 
VERONICA You look bushed. What time did you get to bed? 
DANTE I don't know-like two-thirty, three. 
VERONICA What were you doing up so late? 
DANTE (skirting) Hunhh? Nothing. 
VERONICA (persistent) What were you doing? 
DANTE Nothing! Jesus! I gotta fight with you now? 
VERONICA Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive? 
DANTE Who's defensive? Just...Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged. 
She stares at him. 
DANTE What? What is that? 
VERONICA She called you, didn't she? 
DANTE Oh, be real! Would you...Would you please hug me? I just went through a very traumatic experience and I haven't been having the best day so far. Now come on. 
VERONICA stares at him. 
DANTE What? What's with that look?! I wasn't talking to anyone, especially her! Look at you, being all sort of...I don't know...stand-offish. 
VERONICA looks away. 
DANTE Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug me. I see how it is. All right Pissy-pants, you just go on being suspicious and quiet. I don't even want to hug you at this point. 
VERONICA looks back at him. 
DANTE (pleadingly) Give you a dollar? 
CUT TO: 
INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY 
A NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads: 
PLEASE LEAVE MONEY ON THE COUNTER. TAKE CHANGE WHEN APPLICABLE. BE HONEST. 
DANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor, behind the counter. VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms, his head on her chest. Change is heard hitting the counter. 
DANTE (to O.C. customer) Thanks. 
The door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving. 
VERONICA How much money did you leave up there? 
DANTE Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning. 
VERONICA You're trusting. 
INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY 
A videocassette encased in the customary black box flips repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER glares at DANTE. Dante studies a copy of Paradise Lost, making a strong attempt at not noticing the glare. 
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (pissed off) I thought that place was supposed to be opened at eleven o'clock? It's twenty after! 
DANTE I called his house twice already. He should be here soon. 
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER It's not like it's a demanding job. I'd like to get paid to sit on my ass and watch TV. The other day I walked in there and that sonofabitch was sleeping. 
DANTE I'm sure he wasn't sleeping. 
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER You calling me a liar? 
DANTE No; he was probably just resting his eyes. 
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER What the hell is that? Resting his eyes! It's not like he's some goddamned air traffic controller! 
DANTE Actually, that's his night job. 
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER Such a wiseass. But go ahead. Crack wise. That's why you're jockeying a register in some fucking local convenience store instead of doing an honest day's work. (tosses tape on counter) I got no more time to bullshit around waiting for that sonofabitch. You make sure this gets back. The number's eight-twelve-Wynarski. And I wanted to get a damn movie, too. 
DANTE If you'll just tell me the title of your rental choice, I'll have him hold it for you. 
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (storming out) Don't hurt yourself. I'm going to Big Choice Video instead. 
He storms out. Dante lifts a ring of keys from the counter. 
DANTE (in a whisper) You forgot your keys. 
The half-filled trash can swallows the ring of keys.

Another VIDEO-ANXIOUS CUSTOMER leans against the video store door. A hapless RANDAL drifts by and stops. He glances at the door, peers inside, and gives the door a tug. 
V.A. CUSTOMER The guy ain't here yet. 
RANDAL You're kidding. It's almost eleven- thirty! 
V.A. CUSTOMER I know. I've been here since eleven. 
RANDAL (kicks the door) Man! I hate it when I can't rent videos! 
V.A. CUSTOMER I would've went to Big Choice, but the tape I want is right there on the wall. 
RANDAL Which one? 
V.A. CUSTOMER Dental School. 
RANDAL You came for that too? That's the movie I came for. 
V.A. CUSTOMER I have first dibs. 
RANDAL Says who? 
V.A. CUSTOMER (suddenly snotty) Says me. I've been here for half an hour. I'd call that first dibs. 
RANDAL Ain't gonna happen, my friend. I'm getting that tape. 
V.A. CUSTOMER Like hell you are! 
RANDAL I'll bet you twenty bucks you don't get to rent that tape. 
V.A. CUSTOMER Twenty bucks? 
RANDAL Twenty bucks. 
V.A. CUSTOMER All right, asshole, you're on. 
RANDAL walks away. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stands like a sentry at post. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms up. 
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER You see a pair of keys lying around here somewhere?

RANDAL dances in, attempting a soft-shoe routine. He sees DANTE and stops dead, midshuffle. 
DANTE You're late. 
RANDAL What the hell are you doing here? I thought you were playing hockey at one. 
DANTE The boss called. Arthur fell ill. 
RANDAL Why are the shutters closed? 
DANTE Someone jammed gum in the locks. 
RANDAL Bunch of savages in this town. 
DANTE That's what I said. 
RANDAL Shit, if I'd known you were working, I would've come even later. 
DANTE Seven months. 
RANDAL Chick's nuts about you. How long did you date Caitlin? 
DANTE Five years. 
RANDAL Chick only made you nuts. She cheated on you how many times? 
DANTE Eight and a half. 
RANDAL (looks up from paper) Eight and a half? 
DANTE Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me. 
RANDAL That's cheating? 
DANTE In the middle of it, she calls me Brad. 
RANDAL She called you Brad? 
DANTE She called me Brad. 
RANDAL That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl "Mom." 
DANTE I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson. 
RANDAL What do you mean? 
DANTE She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party. 
RANDAL Oh, my God. 
DANTE Great story, isn't it? 
RANDAL That girl was vile to you. 
DANTE Interesting postscript to that story: Do you know who wound up going with Brad Michaelson in the other dark bedroom? 
RANDAL Your mother. 
DANTE Allan Harris. 
RANDAL Chess team Allan Harris?! 
DANTE The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep. 
RANDAL That's frightening. 
DANTE It takes different strokes to move the world. 
RANDAL In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles. 
DANTE Because there was a lot of good in our relationship. 
RANDAL Oh yeah. 
DANTE I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple. That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity. 
RANDAL You think things would be any different now? 
DANTE They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone. 
RANDAL (suddenly recalling) Oh shit, I've got to place an order. 
DANTE I'm talking to myself here. 
RANDAL No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...? 
DANTE ...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level. 
RANDAL What about Veronica? 
DANTE I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin. 
RANDAL Caitlin's on the same wave-length? 
DANTE I think it's safe to say yes. 
RANDAL Then I think all four of you had better sit down and talk it over. 
DANTE All four? 
RANDAL You, Veronica, Caitlin... (lays paper flat) ...and Caitlin's fiancé. 
THE HEADLINE of the engagement announcement reads, BREE TO WED ASIAN DESIGN MAJOR.

RANDAL dials the phone. He holds a list in his hand. 
RANDAL Yes, I'd like to place an order, please...Thank you.

MOTHER Excuse me, but do you see videotapes? 
GIRL 1 No way! 
JAY Swear. (to OLAF) Olaf, metal! 
OLAF makes a metal face. 
JAY That's his fucking metal face. (to OLAF) Olaf, girls nice? 
OLAF looks the girls up and down. 
OLAF Skrelnick. 
JAY (laughs) That's fucked up. 
GIRL 1 What did he say? 
JAY I don't know, man. He's a fucking character. 
GIRL 2 He really wants to play metal? 
JAY He's got his own band in Moscow. It's called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans" or something like that. 
GIRL 1 That doesn't sound metal. 
JAY You gotta hear him sing. (to OLAF) Olaf, "Berserker!" 
OLAF laughs and shakes his head. 
JAY Come on, man, "Berserker!" 
GIRL 2 Does he sing in English or Russian? 
JAY English. (to OLAF) Come on, "Berserker!" Girls think sexy. 
OLAF (relents) Da. Da. 
JAY He's gonna sing it. This is too funny. 
OLAF (in broken English) MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A TRUCK BERSERKER! WOULD YOU LIKE SOME MAKING FUCK? BERSERKER! 
JAY (laughing) That's fucking funny, man! 
GIRL 1 Did he say "making fuck?" 
JAY Wait, there's more. (to OLAF) Olaf: sing... (makes pot-smoking face)

DANTE is tugging at a can of Pringles potato chips. The can is stuck on a MAN'S hand. 
DANTE You hold the counter and I'll pull. 
MAN Usually I just turn the can upside down. 
DANTE (pulling) Maybe we should soap your hand or something. 
MAN (straining) They oughta put some kind of warning on these cans, like they do with cigarettes. 
DANTE I think it's coming now... 
The can pops off and DANTE staggers back a few steps. The man rubs his hand. 
MAN Thanks. I thought I was gonna have to go to the hospital. 
DANTE I'll throw this out. Precautionary measure. 
MAN It stings a little. 
DANTE A word of advice: Sometimes it's best to let those hard to reach chips go. 
DANTE steps behind the counter. 
MAN Thanks. 
The MAN exits as RANDAL enters. DANTE throws the canister away. 
DANTE Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married! 
RANDAL All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with. (notices Dante's confusion) All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius. (MORE) 
RANDAL (CONT'D) You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living. 
The BLUE-COLLAR MAN joins them. 
BLUE-COLLAR MAN Excuse me. I don't mean to interrupt, but what were you talking about? 
RANDAL The ending of Return of the Jedi. 
DANTE My friend is trying to convince me that any contractors working on the uncompleted Death Star were innocent victims when the space station was destroyed by the rebels. 
BLUE-COLLAR MAN Well, I'm a contractor myself. I'm a roofer... (digs into pocket and produces business card) Dunn and Reddy Home Improvements. And speaking as a roofer, I can say that a roofer's personal politics come heavily into play when choosing jobs. 
RANDAL Like when? 
BLUE-COLLAR MAN Three months ago I was offered a job up in the hills. A beautiful house with tons of property. It was a simple reshingling job, but I was told that if it was finished within a day, my price would be doubled. Then I realized whose house it was. 
DANTE Whose house was it? 
BLUE-COLLAR MAN Dominick Bambino's. 
RANDAL "Babyface" Bambino? The gangster? 
BLUE-COLLAR MAN The same. The money was right, but the risk was too big. I knew who he was, and based on that, I passed the job on to a friend of mine. 
DANTE Based on personal politics. 
BLUE-COLLAR MAN Right. And that week, the Foresci family put a hit on Babyface's house. My friend was shot and killed. He wasn't even finished shingling. 
RANDAL No way! 
BLUE-COLLAR MAN (paying for coffee) I'm alive because I knew there were risks involved taking on that particular client. My friend wasn't so lucky. (pauses to reflect) You know, any contractor willing to work on that Death Star knew the risks. If they were killed, it was their own fault. A roofer listens to this... (taps his heart) not his wallet. 
The BLUE-COLLAR MAN exits. DANTE and RANDAL remain respectfully quiet for a moment. An angry WOMAN opens the door and pokes her head in. 
WOMAN Is that video store open or not?

RANDAL reads a newspaper. An INDECISIVE CUSTOMER studies the two rental choices she holds. She looks from one movie to the other repeatedly. 
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER (attempting a solicit help) They say so much, but they never tell you if it's any good. 
RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER half turns to see if her comment was even heard. She tries again, but this time with a different approach. 
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER Are either of these any good? 
RANDAL continues to read. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER tries harder, then louder and more direct: 
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER Sir! 
RANDAL continues to read. 
RANDAL (flatly) What. 
The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER holds up her rental choices. 
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER (politely) Are either of these any good? 
RANDAL, as always, reads on. 
RANDAL (again, flatly) I don't watch movies. 
The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER is a tad flabbergasted, but not put off. 
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER Well, have you heard anything about either of them? 
RANDAL does his level best to not get involved. 
RANDAL (reading) No. 
The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER challenges him. 
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER (in disbelief) You've never heard anybody say anything about either movie? 
RANDAL (O.C.) I find it's best to stay out of other people's affairs. 
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER (with a new determination) Well, how about these two movies? (holds up the same two) 
RANDAL continues to read his paper, not looking up. 
RANDAL They suck. 
The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER smirks smugly at RANDAL and his paper. She has caught him. 
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER I just held up the same two movies. You're not even paying attention. 
RANDAL No, I wasn't. 
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER I don't think your manager would appreciate... 
RANDAL (turning the page) I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am. 
INDECISIVE CUSTOMER I beg your pardon! 
SMOKER I was in the Food City last year when the same thing happened, different guy though. Stock boy told me that the guy had been looking through the eggs for like half an hour, doing all sorts of endurance tests and shit. I ask the kid how come nobody called the manager, and he says it happens twice a week, sometimes more. 
RANDAL Get out of here. 
SMOKER I kid you not. They call it Shell Shock. Only happens with guidance counselors for some reason. The kid said they used to make a big deal about it, but there's no point. 
The ODD MAN places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor. He quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg still sitting on the floor. 
SMOKER (O.C.) He said they always pay for whatever they break and they never bother anybody. 
DANTE, RANDAL and the SMOKER stare at the O.C. man. 
DANTE Why guidance counselors? 
SMOKER If your job served as little purpose as theirs, wouldn't you lose it, too? 
RANDAL Come to think of it, my guidance counselor was kind of worthless. 
SMOKER (grabbing matches) See? It's important to have a job that makes a difference, boys. That's why I kill Chinamen for the railroad.

POV RANDAL: THE EMPTY COUNTER 
And then a LITTLE GIRL comes into view, smiling and holding money. She can't be any more than five. 
LITTLE GIRL (innocently) Can I have a pack of cigarettes? 
RANDAL, without looking up from his magazine, completes the transaction. THE LITTLE GIRL puts a cigarette in her mouth. RANDAL hands her matches. DANTE returns to the counter as the girl skips away. Dante holds a price gun. 
DANTE Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie. 
RANDAL You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour? 
DANTE What's a jizz-mopper? 
RANDAL He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off. 
DANTE Nudie booth? 
RANDAL Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth? 
DANTE I guess not. 
A female CUSTOMER pops items onto the counter. DANTE rings her up. 
RANDAL Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks. 
DANTE What kind of show? 
RANDAL Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do. These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body...any opening. (to customer) He's led a very sheltered life. 
DANTE (indicating CUSTOMER) Can we talk about this later? 
RANDAL The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away. 
CUSTOMER (grabbing her bag, disgusted) This is the last time I come to this place. 
DANTE Excuse me? 
CUSTOMER Using filthy language in front of the customers...you should both get fired. 
DANTE We're sorry, ma'am. We got a little carried away. 
CUSTOMER Well, I don't know if sorry can make up for it. I found your remarks highly offensive. 
The CUSTOMER stands silently, awaiting something. 
RANDAL Well, you think that's offensive... 
RANDAL flips open the magazine's centerfold-a graphic picture of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread wide open. 
RANDAL ...then check this out. I think you can see her kidneys. 
RANDAL checks out the centerfold wistfully. DANTE frantically apologizes to the rapidly exiting CUSTOMER. 
DANTE Ma'am, ma'am, I'm sorry! Please, wait a second, ma'am... 
The CUSTOMER is gone. DANTE'S pursuit stops at the counter. DANTE turns on RANDAL. 
DANTE Why do you do things like that? You know she's going to come back and tell the boss. 
RANDAL Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers. 
DANTE I'm gonna hear it tomorrow. 
RANDAL You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer. 
DANTE What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them. 
RANDAL Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis. 
DANTE There aren't. 
RANDAL How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off? 
RANDAL (O.C.) (exaggeratively impressed) Thirty-seven! 
DANTE (to O.C.) Shut up! (to VERONICA) Yes, I've calmed down, I'm still not happy about it, but I've been able to deal. 
RANDAL makes loud slurping noises from O.C. 
DANTE (to O.C.) Why don't you go back to the video store? 
RANDAL walks past the two, and pats VERONICA on the head. He exits. 
VERONICA You had to tell him. 
DANTE I had to tell someone. He put it into perspective. 
VERONICA What did he say? 
DANTE At least he wasn't thirty-six. 
VERONICA And that made you feel better? 
DANTE And he said most of them are college guys, I've never met or seen. 
VERONICA The ostrich syndrome: if you don't see it... 
DANTE ...it isn't there. Yes. 
VERONICA Thank you for being rational. 
DANTE Thank you for the lasagne. 
VERONICA You couldn't get these shutters open? 
DANTE I called a locksmith and he said the earliest he could get here it tomorrow. 
VERONICA Bummer, Well, I've gotta head back for the one-thirty class. 
DANTE What time do you get finished? 
VERONICA Eight. But I have a sorority meeting till nine, so I'll be back before you close. Can we go out and get some coffee? 
DANTE Sure. 
VERONICA Good. (kisses him) I'll see you when you close, then. Enjoy the lasagne. 
She exits. DANTE leans against the magazine rack with his lasagne, contemplative. RANDAL pops his head in and makes the loud slurping noise again.

RANDAL is recommending titles to potential customers. 
RANDAL All right, now if you're really feeling dangerous tonight, then Smokey and the Bandit Three is the movie you must rent. 
CUSTOMER (studying box) This doesn't even have Burt Reynolds in it. 
RANDAL Hey, neither did ET; but that was a great movie, right? 
DANTE opens the door and leans in. 
DANTE Can you come next door? I gotta make a phone call. 
RANDAL (to DANTE) Smokey Three: thumbs up, am I right? 
DANTE The best Burtless movie ever made. 
DANTE exits. RANDAL gives his customers the what-did-I-tell- you look.

THE CAT lies on the counter. Pull back to reveal RANDAL as he rings up an order. The CUSTOMER pets the cat, smiling. 
CUSTOMER Awww, he's so cute. What's his name? 
RANDAL Lenin's Tomb. 
Dolly over to DANTE, on the phone. 
DANTE Hello, is Mr. Synder there? This is Dante...Did he say if he was on his way here?...Here...The convenience store...I know, but the other guy called out this morning and Mr. (MORE) 
DANTE (CONT'D) Synder asked me to cover until he got here. He said he'd be here by noon, but it's one-thirty now, so I...Excuse me...Vermont?!...No, that can't be; I talked to him this morning...He left at what time?...He really went to Vermont?...When the hell was someone going to tell me?...He promised he was coming by noon!...Jesus...When does he get back?!...TUESDAY!...You've gotta be fucking kidding me!...I've got a hockey game at two, and the fucking shutters are jammed closed, and he's in Vermont?...I'm not even supposed to be here today!! (deep sigh) So I'm stuck here till closing?...This is just great...I just can't believe...I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell at you...No...No, I'll be all right...Well, that's all I can do, right?...Thanks. 
He hangs up. RANDAL joins him. 
RANDAL Vermont? 
DANTE Can you believe this?! 
RANDAL He didn't mention it when he called you this morning? 
DANTE Not a fucking word! Slippery shit! 
RANDAL So, what-you're stuck here all day? 
DANTE FUCK! 
OLD MAN Thanks, young man. You've got a heart of gold. 
The OLD MAN sifts through some papers and a few magazines. He comes back to the counter. 
DANTE You know, you probably could've been home, already, in the time it's taken you to get in there. 
OLD MAN Can I trouble you for one of those magazines? 
DANTE I said go ahead. 
OLD MAN No, I mean the ones there. Behind the counter. 
DANTE glances over and reacts. 
DANTE The porno mags? 
OLD MAN Yeah. I like the cartoons. They make me laugh. They draw the biggest titties. 
DANTE (hands one to him) Here. Now leave me alone. 
OLD MAN Uh, can I have the other one. The one below this one. They show more in that one. 
DANTE makes the switch. 
OLD MAN Thanks son. I appreciate this. 
The OLD MAN walks off. We hear the back door open and close, then the front door does the same. RANDAL joins DANTE. 
RANDAL Helluva game! 
DANTE One ball!! They come all the way here...I close the damn store...for one ball! 
RANDAL Hockey's hockey. At least we got to play. 
DANTE Randal, twelve minutes is not a game! Jesus, it's barely a warm-up! 
RANDAL Bitch, bitch, bitch. You want something to drink? (walking away) 
DANTE Gatorade. 
Pause. Then... 
RANDAL (O.C.) What happened to all the Gatorade? 
DANTE Exactly. They drank it all. 
RANDAL (O.C.) After an exhausting game like that I can believe it. 
DANTE (as RANDAL) "It's not like we're gonna sell out." 
RANDAL comes back with drinks. 
RANDAL You know what Sanford told me? (offering drink) 
DANTE I still can't believe Caitlin's getting married. 
RANDAL Julie Dwyer died. 
DANTE Yeah, right. 
RANDAL No, I'm serious. 
DANTE is visibly taken aback. 
DANTE Oh, my god. 
RANDAL Sanford's brother dates her cousin. He found out this morning. 
DANTE How? When? 
RANDAL Embolism in her brain. Yesterday. 
DANTE Jesus. 
RANDAL She was swimming at the YMCA pool when it happened. Died midbackstroke. 
DANTE I haven't seen her in almost two years. 
RANDAL Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she one of the illustrious twelve? 
DANTE Number six. 
RANDAL You've had sex with a dead person. 
DANTE I'm gonna go to her wake. 
RANDAL No, you're not. 
DANTE Why not? 
RANDAL It's today. 
DANTE What!? 
RANDAL Paulsen's Funeral Parlor. The next show is at four. 
DANTE Shit. What about tomorrow? 
RANDAL Yeah, but at what a price. 
Silence. Then... 
DANTE I could never reach. 
RANDAL Reach what? 
DANTE You know. 
RANDAL What, your dick? 
DANTE Yeah. Like you said, you know. I guess everyone tries it, sooner of later. 
RANDAL I never tried it. 
DANTE glares at RANDAL. Silence. Then... 
RANDAL Fucking pervert. 
CUT TO: 
EXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY 
DANTE and RANDAL walk up the path to the funeral parlor. 
DANTE I know it was a bad idea to close the store. 
RANDAL Listen to you. 
DANTE I can't help it. At least when we were playing hockey outside, I could see if anyone wanted to go in. 
RANDAL Nobody's there. It's four o'clock on a Saturday. How many people ever come to the store at four on a Saturday? 
CUT TO: 
EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. DAY 
A MASSIVE CROWD is outside the store. 
CUT TO: 
EXT: FUNERAL PARLOR. DAY 
DANTE and RANDAL run from the front door, closely chased by a small crowd of angry mourners. Car locks are slammed down. The car screams away. The pursuing crowd stands in the middle of the street, shaking their fists, throwing things. 
CUT TO: 
EXT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT 
The car pulls up and RANDAL and DANTE get out. Absolutely nobody is outside. 
DANTE (furious) I can't fucking believe you!! 
RANDAL I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault! 
DANTE You knocked the fucking casket over, for Chrissakes! 
RANDAL I was just leaning on it! It was an accident! 
DANTE Does anyone ever knock over a casket on purpose? 
RANDAL So the casket fell over! Big deal! 
DANTE Her fucking body fell out! 
RANDAL So they'll put her back in! It's not like it's gonna matter if she breaks something! 
DANTE (opening door) Just...go! Go open the video store. 
JAY (O.C.) (mimicking) Yeah! Open the video store!! 
RANDAL (to O.C.) Shut the fuck up, junkie! 
JAY enters the frame, right next to RANDAL. He aims his butt at him and farts. RANDAL lunges for him. DANTE grabs RANDAL. 
DANTE (to RANDAL) Go open the video store. 
JAY Yeah, you cock-smoking clerk. 
DANTE (to JAY) How many times I gotta tell you not to deal outside the store. 
JAY I'm not dealing. 
A KID tugs at JAY'S shirt. 
KID You got anything, man? 
JAY Yeah, what do you want? 
RANDAL heads to the video store. DANTE enters the convenience store and slides the sign to OPEN. After a few seconds, the IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (guy who lost his keys) appears, flashlight in hand, scanning the ground. 
IMPATIENT CUSTOMER (to JAY) Hey, did you see a set of keys lying around here somewhere? 
CUT TO: 
INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT 
DANTE I know. I'm sorry. Let me refund your cigarette money, and we'll call it even. 
CUSTOMER (considerably calmer; takes money) This is the last time I ever come here. (to RANDAL) And if I ever see you again, I'm gonna break your fucking head open! 
The CUSTOMER leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL salutes him. 
DANTE (angrily) What the fuck did you do that for? 
RANDAL Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines. 
DANTE Jesus! 
RANDAL And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior. 
DANTE What? 
RANDAL If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice. (extends opened palm) Agreed? 
DANTE (shakes his head; hands over keys) You're a danger to both the dead and the living. 
RANDAL I like to think I'm a master of my own destiny. 
DANTE Please, get the hell out of here. 
RANDAL I know I'm your hero. 
RANDAL exits.

DANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER). He lifts the gallon of milk into a paper bag, letting out a slight grunt. 
TRAINER Sounds to me like somebody needs to hit the gym. 
DANTE Excuse me? 
TRAINER I heard you strain when you put the milk in the bag. That milk only weighs about seven pounds. 
DANTE I didn't strain. I sighed. 
TRAINER I don't think so. That was a grunt; a deep inhalation of oxygen to aid in the stretching of muscles. I'm a trainer. I know what that sound signifies: you're out of shape. 
DANTE I don't think so. 
TRAINER Oh, I do. You made the same noise when you reached across the counter for my cash. Your muscles are thin and sadly underutilized. 
DANTE They are not. 
TRAINER Yes, they are. You're out of shape. 
DANTE What are you talking about? There's no fat on this body. 
TRAINER No fat, but no tone either. You don't get enough exercise. 
A female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway. 
HEATHER Are you open? 
DANTE Yes. 
HEATHER (grabs a paper) Just the paper. 
DANTE (to HEATHER) Thirty-fire. 
TRAINER (to HEATHER) Let me ask you a question: Do you think this guy's out of shape? 
HEATHER (studies DANTE) I don't know. I can't really tell from here. 
TRAINER He is. 
DANTE I am not. 
TRAINER How much can you bench? 
DANTE I don't know. 
HEATHER (studying DANTE) I'd say about sixty, seventy-tops. 
DANTE I know I can bench more than that! 
TRAINER I think the lady called it. 
HEATHER My ex-boyfriend was about his height, but he was much bulkier. He could bench two-fifty, three hundred easy. 
TRAINER I do about three-fifty, four. 
HEATHER No way! 
TRAINER (rolling up sleeve) Feel that. 
HEATHER That's tight. Solid. 
TRAINER Now feel his. (to DANTE) Roll up your sleeve, chief. 
DANTE Oh for God's sake! 
HEATHER She said one time you set up a tent on the beach and you guys did it in the middle of this big rainstorm. 
DANTE What? When? When did all this shit happen? 
TRAINER Hey man, that was a long time ago. Don't let it get to you. 
HEATHER I'm surprised you never found out about it, Dante. Everybody in school knew-even in my class. 
DANTE Jesus Christ, what next? 
The SUITED MAN rips a piece of paper out of his notebook and hands it to DANTE. 
SUITED MAN Here you go. 
DANTE What's this? 
SUITED MAN A fine, for five hundred dollars. 
DANTE WHAT? 
TRAINER Five hundred bucks? What for? 
SUITED MAN For violation of New Jersey Statute Section Two A, number one-seventy slash fifty-one: Any person who sells or makes available tobacco or tobacco-related products to persons under the age of eighteen is regarded as disorderly. 
DANTE What are you talking about? 
SUITED MAN According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor. 
DANTE I didn't do that! 
SUITED MAN You said you were here all day? 
DANTE Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! 
SUITED MAN An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours. It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child. 
DANTE But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid! 
TRAINER To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag! 
HEATHER That's sick, Dante. 
DANTE I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear! 
SUITED MAN The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day. 
The SUITED MAN exits, with DANTE trying to follow. 
DANTE But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey! 
TRAINER (takes back the card) Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old. (to HEATHER) Can I offer you a ride somewhere? 
HEATHER Sure. How about the beach? 
TRAINER I like the way you think. 
The two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons. He rubs his forehead. 
DANTE Jesus! What next?

DANTE spins, angrily. 
DANTE What? 
His expression softens.

JAY For this kind of hash, you need that kind of cash. 
JOHN How long you gonna be here? 
JAY Till ten. Then I'm going to John K's party. 
JOHN You're gonna be at John K's party? 
JAY (to SILENT BOB) My man is deaf. (yelling) I'M GOING TO JOHN K'S PARTY! (quieter) Neh. 
JOHN Yo, don't sell all that. 'Cause I'm gonna get the cash and buy it from you at John K's. You're gonna bring it, right? 
JAY The only place I don't bring my drugs is church. And that ain't till Sunday morning. 
JOHN Yo. I'll see you at that party. (puts his hand up to be slapped) I'll see you there? 
JAY (reluctantly slapping hands) I'll see you there. 
CAITLIN The story goes like this: He proposed, and I told him I had to think about it, and he insisted I wear the ring anyway. Then my mother told the paper we were engaged. 
DANTE How like her. 
CAITLIN Then my mother called me this morning and told me the announcement was in the paper. That's when I hopped the train to come back here, because I knew you'd be a wreck. 
DANTE Thanks for the vote of confidence. 
CAITLIN Was I right? 
DANTE Wreck is a harsh term. Disturbed is more like it. Mildly disturbed even. 
CAITLIN I love a macho façade. It's such a turn-on. (sniffing air) What smells like shoe polish? 
DANTE And you came here to what? To comfort me? 
CAITLIN The last thing I needed was for you to think I was hiding something from you. 
DANTE But you were. 
CAITLIN No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people. 
DANTE Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle-I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody. 
CAITLIN I'm giving him his ring back. 
DANTE What? 
CAITLIN I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'' going to fit in all of the other stuff. I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway... 
DANTE Sang? His name is a past tense? 
CAITLIN Stop it. He's a nice guy. 
DANTE If he's so nice, why aren't you going to marry him? 
CAITLIN I just told you. 
DANTE There's more, isn't there? 
CAITLIN Why, Mr. Hicks-whatever do you mean? 
DANTE Tell me I don't have something to do with it. 
CAITLIN You don't have anything to do with it. 
DANTE You lie. 
CAITLIN Look how full of yourself you are. 
DANTE I just believe in giving credit where credit is due. And I believe that I'm the impetus behind your failure to wed. 
CAITLIN If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I having sex with an Asian design major? 
DANTE Jesus, you're caustic. 
CAITLIN I had to bring you down from that cloud you were floating on. When I say I don't want to get married, I mean just that. I don't want to marry anybody. Not for years. 
DANTE So who's asking? I don't want to marry you. 
CAITLIN Good. Stay in that frame of mind. 
DANTE Buy can we date? 
CAITLIN I'm sure Sang and-Veronica?-would like that. 
DANTE We could introduce them. They might hit it off. 
CAITLIN You're serious. You want to date again. 
DANTE I would like to be your boyfriend, yes. 
CAITLIN It's just the shock of seeing me after three years. Believe me, you'll get over it. 
DANTE Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market... 
CAITLIN You work in a market, all right. 
DANTE Cute. Tell me you wouldn't want to go out again. After all the talking we've been doing. 
CAITLIN The key word here is talk, Dante. I think the idea, the conception of us dating is more idyllic than what actually happens when we date. 
DANTE So...what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating? 
CAITLIN I don't know. Maybe we should just see what happens. 
DANTE Let me take you out tonight. 
CAITLIN You mean, on a date? 
DANTE Yes. A real date. Dinner and a movie. 
CAITLIN The Dante Hicks Dinner and a Movie Date. I think I've been on that one before. 
DANTE You have a better suggestion? 
CAITLIN How about the Caitlin Bree Walk on the Boardwalk, Then Get Naked Somewhere Kind of Private Date? 
DANTE Because I'm happy. 
RANDAL You're happy? 
DANTE I'm happy. 
RANDAL You're happy to get a fine? 
DANTE No. I'm happy because Caitlin came to see me. 
RANDAL Now I know you're lying. 
DANTE I'm not. She just left. 
RANDAL What did she say? 
DANTE She's not going to marry that guy. She went home to tell her mother. 
RANDAL You're kidding. 
DANTE I'm not. 
RANDAL (takes it in for a moment) Wow. You've had quite an evening. 
DANTE She went home, she's getting ready, and we're going out. 
RANDAL I feel so ineffectual. Is there anything I can do for you? 
DANTE Watch the store while I go home and change. 
RANDAL What happened to title dictates behavior? 
DANTE This is my way of spitting water at life. 
RANDAL (suddenly aware) Hey, what about Veronica? 
DANTE No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word. 
RANDAL You're a snake. 
DANTE In my absence, try not to sell cigarettes to any newborns. 
RANDAL You want me to bring the VCR over here so we can watch this? 
DANTE I might be leaving early to go out with Caitlin, in which case you'll have to close the store tonight. 
RANDAL All right, but you're missing out. Chicks with dicks. 
DANTE (puts cats on counter) I'll read the book. 
DANTE exits. A CUSTOMER comes back to the counter. He pets the cat.

JAY and SILENT BOB watch as DANTE passes. A small group of burners are poised around the store door. JAY carefully writes on a large piece of paper, using a thick marker. SILENT BOB hands him the scissors. JAY slowly cuts the large piece of paper. SILENT BOB hands him the tape. JAY snaps off a few pieces, and plasters the sign to the convenience store door. It is a large word balloon, and it reads I EAT COCK! Once in place, he raps on the window. RANDAL looks out, his face adjacent to the word balloon, making it appear as if he is saying he eats cock.

RANDAL Ladies and gentleman, Mrs. Asian Design Major herself: Caitlin Bree! 
CAITLIN You saw that article? God, isn't it awful? My mother sent that in. 
RANDAL I take it she likes the guy. 
CAITLIN You'd think she was marrying him. What are you watching? 
RANDAL Children's programming. What did your mom say when you told her you weren't engaged anymore? 
CAITLIN She said not to come home until graduation. 
RANDAL Wow, you got thrown out? For Dante? 
CAITLIN What can I say? He does weird things to me. 
RANDAL Can I watch? 
CAITLIN You can hold me down. 
RANDAL Can I join in? 
CAITLIN You might be let down. I'm not a hermaphrodite. 
RANDAL Few are. So what makes you think you can maintain a relationship with Dante this time around? 
CAITLIN A woman's intuition. Something in me says it's time to give the old boy a serious try. 
RANDAL (to DANTE) You dog! I didn't see you go back there. 
DANTE is bewildered. 
CAITLIN And the fact that there weren't any lights made it so... (she lets out a growl and hugs DANTE) God! That was so great! 
DANTE (quietly) It wasn't me. 
CAITLIN (laughing it off) Yeah, right. Who was it: Randal? 
DANTE (to RANDAL) Was it you? 
RANDAL I was here the whole time. 
CAITLIN (half-laughing) You two better quit it. 
DANTE I'm serious. 
CAITLIN (beat) We didn't just have sex in the bathroom? 
DANTE No. 
Everyone is silent. Then... 
CAITLIN Stop this. This isn't funny. 
DANTE I'm not kidding. I just got back from outside. 
CAITLIN (covering her chest) This isn't fucking funny, Dante! 
DANTE I'm not fooling around! (to RANDAL) Who went back there? 
RANDAL Nobody! I swear! 
CAITLIN I feel nauseous. 
DANTE Are you sure somebody was back there? 
CAITLIN (hits DANTE) I didn't just fuck myself! Jesus, I'm going to be sick! 
RANDAL You just fucked a total stranger? 
DANTE Shut the fuck up! 
CAITLIN I can't believe this! I feel faint... 
DANTE (to RANDAL) Call the police. 
RANDAL Why? 
CAITLIN No, don't! 
DANTE There's a strange man in our bathroom, and he just raped Caitlin!

CORONER What time was this? 
DANTE Um...I don't know. (to RANDAL) What time did hockey end? 
RANDAL Around three or something. 
DANTE What time did we go to the funeral? 
RANDAL I think four. 
CORONER Wait a second? Who was working here today? 
DANTE Just me. 
CORONER I thought you just said you played hockey and went to a funeral. 
DANTE We did. 
CORONER Then who operated the store? 
DANTE Nobody. It was closed. 
CORONER With this guy locked in? 
DANTE Everything happened at once. I guess I forgot he was back there. 
VERONICA stares, dumbfounded. 
VERONICA And...he told you all of this? 
RANDAL Pretty much. All except the latent homosexuality part-that's just my theory. 
VERONICA I...I don't know what to say. 
RANDAL Don't hold it against him. He just never got Caitlin out of his system. It's not your fault. It's Dante. (beat) I don't know thing one about chicks. Do you want to cry or something? I can leave. 
VERONICA I'm not sad. 
RANDAL You're not? 
VERONICA No, I'm more furious. I'm pissed off. I feel like he's been killing time while he tries to grow the balls to tell me how he really feels, and then he can't even do it! He has his friend do it for him! 
RANDAL He didn't ask me to... 
VERONICA After all that I've done for that fuck! And he wants to be with that slut? Fine! He can have his slut! 
RANDAL Um, do you think you can give me a lift home tonight? 
VERONICA (oblivious of RANDAL) I'm going to have a word with that asshole. 
VERONICA storms out. 
RANDAL Wait! Veronica...I don't think... 
RANDAL stares after her. A customer stands nearby. 
RANDAL (to customer) What am I worried about? He'll probably be glad I started the ball rolling. All he ever did was complain about her anyway. I'm just looking out for his best interests. I mean, that's what a friend does, am I right? I did him a favor.

VERONICA (throws purse at him) I'm not the one trying to patch things up with my ex, sneaking around behind your back! And if you think that thirty-seven dicks are a lot, then just wait, mister: I'm going to put the hookers in Times Square to shame with all the guys I go down on now! 
DANTE Would you let me explain... 
VERONICA Explain what? How you were waiting until the time was right, and then you were going to dump me for her? 
DANTE (getting up) Veronica...I...it's not like that anymore...I mean, it was never really like that... 
VERONICA kicks him in the other leg. DANTE goes down, yelling in pain. 
VERONICA You're damn right it's not like that! Because I won't let it be like that! You want your slut? Fine! The slut is yours! 
DANTE I don't want Caitlin... 
VERONICA You don't know what you want, but I'm not going to sit here anymore holding your hand until you figure it out! I've encouraged you to get out of this fucking dump and go back to school, to take charge of your life and find direction. I even transferred so maybe you would be more inclined to go back to college if I was with you. Everyone said it was a stupid move, but I didn't care because I loved you and wanted to see you pull yourself out of this senseless funk you've been in since that whore dumped you, oh so many years ago. And now you want to go back to her so she can fuck you over some more? 
DANTE I don't want to go back with her... 
VERONICA Of course not; not now! You're caught, and now you're trying to snake out of doing what you wanted to do. Well, I won't let you. I want you to follow through on this, just so you can find out what a fucking idiot you are. And when she dumps you again-and she will, Dante, I promise you that-when she dumps you again, I want to laugh at you, right in your face, just so you realize that that was what you gave up our relationship for! (grabs her purse) I'm just glad Randal had the balls to tell me, since you couldn't. 
DANTE (weakly) Randal...? 
VERONICA And having him tell me...that was just the weakest move ever. You're spineless. 
DANTE Veronica, I love you... 
VERONICA Fuck you. 
VERONICA exits. DANTE lies on the floor alone. 
CUT TO: 
EXT: VIDEO STORE. NIGHT 
RANDAL exits and locks the door behind him. 
CUT TO: 
INT: CONVENIENCE STORE. NIGHT 
Tight on RANDAL'S face as he steps inside. 
RANDAL Dante?

"I Pass the vale. I breast the steep. I bear the cross: the cross bears me." -- John Charles Earle Oxford Book Of Mystical Verse 
FADE IN: THE MOON. So fat and full in the night sky you can reach out and touch it. 
HICKS W. 0. This is what's known: There has always been man...and there have always been vampires. BLACK SHAPES swoop past the moonscape, vicious looking things. Much shrieking and wailing. Atop a STONE ZIGGURAT -- We see a GROUP OF MEN -- AZTEC WARRIORS readying themselves with PRIMITIVE WEAPONS -- SLINGS, BOWS, SPEARS. Tonight they know they will die. 
HICKS (CONT'D) Since the beginning -- the two have been locked forever in combat... The vampires were quicker, stronger and had the gift of flight. Quick glimpses of a bloody, brutal battle. Men screaming. Talons ripping. FIERY ARROWS launched against an unseen enemy. 
WHOOSH! With a HOWL, we see A MAN plucked off the ground, his body disappearing in the night. THE IMAGE DISSOLVES as -- the sky turns bright, the moon becoming a familiar ball of yellow gas. 
HICKS (CONT'D) But man had the sun. THE CAMERA TILTS DOWN to find another GROUP OF MEN -- more sophisticated than the first. Makeshift weapons made of metal and steel slung across their backs glinting in the sunlight. They stand before AN EARTHEN STRUCTURE, looks like a GIANT WASP NEST. Unsheathing their weapons, they step grimly inside. We HEAR a HISSING WAIL and the wielding of steel. 
HXCKS (V.0.) (CONT'D) And so it went like this over many years. As man and vampire both evolved -- the wars became bloodier. From afar, we see GIANT STACKS OF CORPSES as hydraulic machines stack the black bodies into pyres as big as buildings, smoke rising to the sky in twisting columns. 
A LONE MAN 
Stands at the base of one of the mammoth pyres. Even from this angle we sens e his quiet dignity. 
HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D) Then came THE PRIESTS -- The Man turns and we see his face is shadowed by a large CROSS TATTOO, cutting across his eyes and down the center. 
HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D) -- Specially trained warriors in the art of vampire combat. They single-handedly turned the tide for the humans. Quick glimpses of a GROUP OF PRIESTS battling a FURY OF VAMPIRES (we still do not get a good look at them). Their technique is otherworldy -- combining the brutality of a Maori Warrior. with the grace of a Samurai. The--combat-is intense. Glorious. An explosion of blood and s b m i l 
HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D) Over time the vampire threat faded. The once fierce race now fatally diminished. A shadow of what they once. were. Through heavy smoke, we see a pile of VAMPIRE CORPSES, a ragged collection of fangs and claws. 
HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D) The remaining vampires were put Into camps and -- by decree of the High Clergy the Priests disbanded. The former warriors to be integrated as members of regular society. We see a WAX SEAL pressed onto an ancient parchment. The document carefully rolled and stored in an ORNATE CHAMBER. 
HICKS (V.0.) (CONT'D) The human race thrived in relative quiet. The vampire menace quickly forgotten for other, more modern threats. 
(BEAT) And the few surviving Priests faded Into quiet obscurity. The chamber is closed. We see an encrusted key turning in a heavy set lock and we -- 
FADE TO BLACK. 
.s. Our story begins with the rusty SCRAPE of a windmill... 
FADE IN: 
EXT. THE WASTELAND - DAY 
Dust swirls in nasty tangles. A LONE MALE FIGURE moves across the plain, long and lean in overalls. AARON PACE. Shadows flicker across his sunburned face, the windmill looming above him. in his hands is an ELECTRONIC DEVICE, he plunges it into the earth. It makes a series of CLICKING SOUNDS, reading the soil. Aaron looks up to see the silhouette of a WOMAN standing in the doorway of his CABIN. He smiles, waving to her. His wife. 
INT. OUTPOST 10 (NURSERY).- DUSK 
A pioneer's wood cabin. Aaron sits surrounded, a lattice work of vines covering the walls and floors in beautiful patterns. Not a trace of soil anywhere in the room, everything hydroponically grown. 
SHANNON (O.S.) Supper's on! He smiles, studying a. stunning RUBY RED FLOWER, separate from the others. His crown jewel. He closes the door and enters -- 
THE KITCHEN SHANNON PACE carries a bowl filled with a steaming green broth, placing it on the dinner table, moving aside a tiny FIGURINE OF JESUS. The surrounding furniture cluttered with religious knickknacks. 
SHANNON (CONT'D) You been spending an awful lot of time behind that door. Makes a woman suspicious. 
AARON Special project. It's taking a little more time than I thought. 
SHANNON Nothing special about milkweed. Unless you like a thorn in the finger. 
AARON Get by me. Shannon-and Lucy crouch at his feet. 
EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME 
The cycles cut their engines, headlights centered on the house. A blistering spotlight. It's quiet. The RIDERS step from their machines. We don't get a look at their faces as one by one they LEAP onto the house and windmill, SKITTERING across the walls and roof like spiders. The blades of the windmill slowly come to a stop. 11U. OUTPOST 10 r- SAME The power goes out, everything going black. 
LUCY 
(TERRIFIED) Daddy? 
We hear the Riders crawling over the outside of the house. Snarling, howling, making terrifying sounds. Then the worst sound of all. Wood being torn apart. BLAM! BLAN! Aaron SHOOTS like crazy, the white light MUZZLE FLASHES providing glimpses of SHAPES moving inside the house. BLACK BODIES blown back. Shrieking. Everything happening lightening fast. Finally, the gun clicks empty and we're plunged back into darkness. 
THE LIGHTS COME BACK ON Aaron is still standing, the house in shambles around him. He's alone. 
AARON 
SHANNON! From outside we hear the cycles revving. Aaron runs to the door. Rips off the board in time to see -- 
EXT. OUTPOST 10 - SAME 
The motorcycles racing away, a cloud of dust in their wake. Aaron runs after but TRIPS on -- 
SHANNON Her body lying in the dirt, head lurching at an obscene' angle. He brushes back her hair -- ere' g UNCT_URE MABKS in hem neck. Crying, he cradles his, wife. Feverishly looking around for 
AARON 
LUCY! He keeps screaming but it's no use -- as the-motorcycles fade in the night he knows -- They've taken her. The CAMERA TILTS to the MOON hanging above the plain. it turns BLACK as we now find ourselves peering into -- 
EXT.. CITY FIVE/DISTRICT TWELVE - DUSK 
The lip of an ENORMOUS SMOKESTACK. One of hundreds. A seemingly endless brick forest reaching to a sky heavy with soot and ash, while below, miles of FACTORIES stretch and stretch. 
A STEAM WHISTLE BLOWS Quitting time. Hundreds of WORKERS trail listlessly from a massive brick and stone COMPLEX. Grey faces betraying another day's toll. 
A TATTOOED FIGURE moves through the crowd, people stepping out of his way. They do this not out of respect. . .but fear. We don't get a good look at him. Just FLASHES -- Shaved head. Eyes like nail guns. Tendons clenching over muscle. As he walks,people whisper. He hears all of it. He heads into the streets. CITIZENS hurry by, some with. surgical masks over their mouths. There's a pale, sickliness to them. Malignant. The Figure suddenly stops. He cocks his bald head -- Something's caught his attention... 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
We move through trash and shadow finding -- A gang of FACTORY WORKERS, uniformed, surrounding a GIRL 
Their LEADER holds her close, BUTCHER KNIFE at her throat. Mouth at her ear. 
LEADER Go ahead ...scream. 
(SMILES) Scream for daddy. He hears a noise, looks up and sees a SILHOUETTE standing at the head of the alley. 
LEADER (CONT'D) Looks like daddy's already here. (points the knife) Well, then. Come on daddy...make it better. The Figure steps into a pool of white light, giving us our first good look at him -- A LAL RGE AK CROSS TATTOO shadows most of his-- a e. Across the eyes and down the center. The Mark Of The Priest. 
LEADER (CONT'D) 
(LAUGHS) A Priest! Well, lookie here.. We got us a real life war-hero boysl Heard you guys were real baddasses. The Workers all pull out large knives. 
LEADER (CONT'D) Guess we'll find out. They move in on Priest, chemicals burning in their blood, mouths leering. Priest folds his hands into the prayer position. The Workers look at each other. Laugh. 
WORKER #1- What's he gonna do. . .BLESS us to death? VOOMI -- There's a whirling SNARL of sound -- the sonic equivalent of a back flip and -- Pries is holding their knives. Before they can react, he throws the knives into their feet. They HOWL, pinned to the concrete. Scared, the leader clutches the girl, pressing against the brick wall as Priest moves towards him. 
LEADER This ain't the war no more. You got no right meddlin'. 
(BEAT) You don't belong here -- You ain't one of us. 
PRIEST 
(SOFTLY) Yes. The lift door clatters shut. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PRIEST'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Sparse, containing only what's needed. Priest peels off his shirt revealing a constellation of old battle scars -- Punctures. Scratches. Bite marks. His skin showing the early signs of aging. He goes to the lone decoration in his apartment -- 
A FADED PHOTO OF THE PACE FAMILY He takes the picture off the wall, studying it. The image bringing him peace. From the streets below, the sound of a GUNSHOT. He looks at the rosary beads, still in his hand. He turns out the light. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - 3 AM 
Unable to sleep, Priest sits on the edge of his bed. Praying. There's a knock at the door. 
PRIEST Who is it? 
MESSENGER (0. S.) Messenger. Priest opens the door. A MESSENGER holds up a PUNCH CARD. 
MESSENGER (CONY ' D) I gota Priority Punch. Originated in the wasteland. Priest takes the card, the man writing up a receipt. 
INT. PRIEST'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Priest goes to a WOODEN BOX, feeding the punch card into it. A Rube Goldberg-like device of PULLEYS and WINCHES squeaks to- life, like a sail, a SCREEN rises and Aaron appears, his image a smudge. He looks awful. A man at the end of himself. 
AARON 
(FILTERED) L-Lucy's gone. They t-took her. I tried to stop 'em. I knowouu're..."retired". But can you find her? Find her before --. 
(SOBS) They killed Shannon. The screen goes blank. Priest shuts his eyes, making the sign of the cross. His hand curls into a fist. 
EXT. CLERGY CITY (ESTABLISHING) - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Magnificent. At the Cities center, a municipal of baroque BASILICAS AND .CHURCHES -- all safely walled off from the rest of the metropolis. 
INT. CLERGY CHAMBER - NIGHT 
Giant shafts of moonlight hit a marbled floor. Priest and Father Koeppen are led by FOUR OFFICERS before A TRIBUNAL OF MONSIGNORS (all at least in their 70's). They sit behind a giant table cloaked in the florid robes of their religion. Men of scripture, creed and doctrine. Priest kneels, bowing his head. 
PRIEST Thank you for meeting with me on such short notice, Monsignors. Even the Monsignors are uneasy'around Priest. Their leader, ORELAS, leans forward, addressing him. 
MONSIGNOR ORELAS Father Koeppen notified us of the situation. Our prayers are with your family. 
PRIEST I come before you because I would like my authority to be reinstated. 
MONSIGNOR ORELAS On what grounds? Priest is taken aback. 
PRIEST She's my blood, Monsignor. 
MONSIGNOR ORELAS The proper authorities are handling the situation. I'm sure they'll.do a fine job. 
PRIEST The proper authorities? 
MONSIGNOR ORELAS All occurrences of vampire. disobedience and felonies are strictly a Federal matter now. 
(BEAT) You Priests did too good a job. The vampire population is classified as endangered. They're protected. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HALBRIDGE - NIGHT 
Hicks and Priest ride in tandem across the plain. Hicks' bike a standard police vehicle, nothing fancy but reliable. They head towards town, passing aWOODEN SIGN`-- 
HALBRIDGE 
EXT. HALERIDGE (MAIN STREET) - NIGHT 
At a glance this seems like one of those frontier towns from an old western. TOWNSPEOPLE gather around a SNAKE-OIL SALESMAN, the man pitching his wares before a painted van reading DR. TOMLIN'S MEDICINE SHOW. TRANCE MUSIC wafts from the nearby saloon. 
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN Do I ask for three dollars?' Do I ask for two dollars? No folks! ONE dollar! One piece of tin and protection is yours! 
PRIEST AND HICKS Pull up in front of the Jail. Hicks eyes the salesman, coolly dismounts and adjusts his hat. 
HICKS â¢Scuse me a minute, He heads towards the crowd, the salesman continuing his pitch. 
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN Vampires are a deadly lot! YOU could be next I I seen a Blackblood bite a man like a gingersnap! The only sure way to be safe is a bag of DR. TOMLIN' S WONDER 
POWDERT (holds up a sack) If you care about your loved ones then you MUST have this amazing elixir in your homes tonight -- WHOOSH! A KNIFE slices through the air, spears the sack and pins it to a nearby wall with a THUNK. Hicks steps to the front of the crowd. it's his knife. 
HICKS You best get in that van and clear on out, mister. 
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN For what reasons? I'm a legitimate business man. Hicks PULLS his SIX-SHOOTER, cocks it. 
HICKS I got six right here. 
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN Sheriff, I am shocked you can be.so cavalier with the safety of your 
TOWNFOLK -- HAM! A bullet blows out the van's headlight. 
HICKS That's one. KAPOW! The windshield cracks like a spiderweb. 
HICKS (CONT'D) Two. Immediately, the salesman quickly packs up his wares, scrambling for the van door. As he gets in, he catches a look at Priest, pauses a moment, then starts up the vehicle and quickly PEELS away. Hicks pulls the knife from the wall, holds the bag up to the crowd. 
HICKS (CONT'D) Now you all listen up. This bag ain't good fornothin' but linin' that man's pockets with your hard earned money. Much shuffling amongst the people -- they trust in their sheriff but they're frightened. An older man named, CROCKER, steps up. 
CROCKER You don't know'that. You're just a kid. 
HICKS I seen enough two-bit hustlers and carry barkers. He ain't no better. 
CROCKER But what if he's right? Hicks tosses the sack to Crocker. 
HICKS Take a look. (Crocker does, the contents spilling to the ground) Ain't nothin' but sand, flour and maybe 'a little garlic.. Oldest trick in the 
WASTELAND: 
(TO EVERYONE) Now I don't blame you for bein' afraid. But those vampires headed clear .on out and they ain't comin' back. 
WOMAN And what about the girl? Hicks pauses. This is not easily said. 
HICKS I filed a report with the Cities last night. I'm sure they're Join' all they can. The townspeople mutter amongst themselves. Hicks looks over to Priest, a GROUP OF CHILDREN have already gathered,. pointing and whispering at him. 
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
A hole in the wall. A few wanted posters and postal warrants tacked up on a board beside asingle jail cell. Hicks leads Priest inside. 
HICKS I've already had one of the boys send for your brother. We got him put up at Paddy's place. Priest gazes out . the; window. A group of TOWNSPEOPLE are milling out front, staring at him.. He pulls down the shade. 
PRIEST How many do you have? The clerk laughs... then realizes he's serious. 
CLERK No offense, Father. You got a permit, right? 
PRIEST I have this. He pulls out a sack of coins, it hits the counter with a solid THUD. The clerk smiles wider.. 
,S, 
INT. PADDY'S PLACE - NIGHT 
Hundreds of bullets all orderly lined on a table top. Priest site with his back to us, hunched over a candle. We're unable to see what he's doing. Aaron picks up a bullet, twirling it in the light. 
AARON Maybe if I knew how to use these she'd still be alive. 
PRIEST Sometimes things just happen. Fault's got nothing to do with it. 
AARON Funny. I'm the one who used to say that. You were the one who always said everything was God's will. Priest takes the bullet from him. 
PRIEST I'm not so sure anymore. There's a KNOCK at the door. Aaron opens it slightly. It's Sheriff Hicks. 
HICKS Aaron. 
AARON Sheriff. 
HICKS You mind if I have a word-with your brother? An awkward BEAT as the two stare at each other. Both knowing what the other's thinking. 
PRIEST (0.S. It's alright. Let him in. Eyeing Priest, Aaron lets the Sheriff in, shutting the door behind him as he leaves. The vibe in the room is uncomfortable -- Priest not even acknowledging Hicks. 
HICKS I'm sure you're well aware of the Vampire Protection Act. 
(MORE) 
HICKS (CONT'D) it strictly states it is forbidden for anyone to hunt vampires anymore. 
C Priest doesn't say anything, he just keeps working. 
HICKS (CONT'D) These days, things go through proper channels. Paperwork drawn up. investigators called in. Procedures followed. (spits, a wad of tobacco) 'Course we both know after a week, girls taken by vampires either and up dead or worse -- turned. 
(THINKS) I'm sure you also wouldn't be surprised to know my office's'been contacted. I'm supposed to arrest you on sight. He pulls a SHINY OBJECT from his pocket, puts it on the table beside Priest. 
HICKS (CONT'D) On the other hand -- if I go after Lucy there'll be a warrant on mybead too...and that'll put us in the same briar patch. 
O Priest looks at the object -- It's Hicks' sheriff's badae. Five points glowing brightly in the candlelight. 
HICKS (CONT'D) We leave at sun up. Priest turns. A moment as each man studies the other. 
PRIEST Why? 
HICKS We're the only chance she's got. Priest picks a bullet from the table, a carefully notched CROSS now in its tip (this is what he's been doing). He SNAPS it in the air. 
PHHHHTTI Hick's knife FLIES across the room, PINNING the bullet to the wall. A thin trickle of gun powder leaks from its casing, spilling to the floor. The kid's fast. 
PRIEST How you with a gun? 
HICKS Better than I am with a knife. Priest considers this. 
PRIEST I'll be there. Nothing more needing to be said, Hicks turns to walk out, stops at the door. 
HICKS What's with all the bullets anyway? I thought Priests don't use firearms. 
A SERIES OF SHOTS as Priest and Hicks BLAST across the barren wasteland. They make a strange pair, not exactly Butch and 
SUNDANCE: A. THUNDERING past Strange ROCK FORMATIONS, bizarre shadows cast across the plains. B. A group of WANDERING MONKS, holy men carrying offerings to the desert, bow as they race by. C.- We.see a PHOTO OF LUCY now stuck to Hicks' windscreen. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BLUFF - LATER 
Astride their bikes, Priest and Hicks, look down at a valley. A SERIES OF ADOBES sit clustered in the basin. CRYPTS. 
HICKS The Nightshade Reservation.. Ain't nothin' but red-outs and rejects. They're a fallen tribe. 
PRIEST Either way. We have two hours to get in and out. 
HICKS What happens in two hours? 
PRIEST Sundown. Hicks looks up at the sky. The sun tilting towards the horizon. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NIGHTSHADE RESERVATION - 60 MINUTES `TIL SUNDOWN 
Priest and Hicks enter engines idling, flocks of chickens run riot underneath their tires CLUCKING. wildly. Crumbling structures. Squalor. 
HICKS This is how most of the reservations are these days. We see faces peering out from wooden slats. Gaunt,: lifeless eyes. These'are FAMILIARS. 
PRIEST Familiars are illegal. 
HICKS Nobody really enforces it. most come from the fringes. Drifters. They're creepy as all hell -- but harmless. They turn off their bikes and dismout. Hicks stepping awkwardly between the chickens. A MALE FAMILIAR stands with a butcher knife over a basin. His gaze is slack -- More dead than alive. He picks up a chicken and CHOP1 off goes its head, blood draining into the container. His voice a hissing rasp. 
S 
FAMILIAR Good afternoon, Sheriff... Father. What brings you to Nightshade? 
HICKS We're looking for a Vamp Pack. They woulda' came through here a couple nights ago. 
FAMILIAR Nobody comes through Nightshade. That's the way we like it. Nice and quiet. 
HICKS Then you won't mind if we have a look around? The Familiar picks up another chicken. Raises the butcher knife. 
FAMILIAR Not at all. CHOPI The head clatters to the ground. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NIGHTSHADE RESERVATION - 30 MINUTES TIL' SUNDOWN 
Priest and Hicks move through the reservation looking for clues. Priest goes to the nearest structure, TWO EYES peer from a tiny slat. The CRYPT'S FAMILIAR. 
PRIEST We're not going to find anything out here...We have to get into the crypts. 
HICKS Not supposed: to do that without a warrant -- BAMI -- Priest kicks the door in. We hear the Familiar SCREECH as Priest steps inside -- 
INT. CRYPT - CONTINUOUS 
The light of the sun's never been in here. Probably should have stayed this way. Tiny bones-cover the entire floor., excrement smearing the walls. The Crypt Familiar cowers-in the corner, shielding his eyes from-the light. His body'fishbelly white and sickly. 
CRYPT FAMILIAR (hissing). Got Got You must got Master will be angry! Nicks is grimacing from the stench. He looks at Priest, not happy as he approaches a STONE SARCOPHAGUS. Running his hand over it. 
PRIEST Where's the girl? 
HICKS Why? You gonna shoot me now? Priest's stare is piercing. A pause then Hicks pulls his six shooter, handing it to him. Priest checks the chambers, giving it a quick spin. 
PRIEST Don't anticipate the trajectory of your target. Know it. He stomps his foot into the fire, launching a GLOWING COAL OF ASH into the air. Priest quickly raises the gun and FIRES, the ash explodes, raining fiery red sparks. 
HICKS You're teaching me to shoot? 
PRIEST I'm teaching you to kill vampires. No more wild shots -- 
HICKS My ass I In case you didn't notice I was pretty damn good out there! And I sure as hell didn't see you doin' much when I had that blade buried in my arm. 
(SPITS) Must've been too busy "focusing". Priest hands the gun back to Hicks. 
PRIEST There's always-two points. A and B. Know the points and you'll know your target. 
HICKS Ain't nothin' but a bunch of bullshit. 
PRIEST I see ten crypts ...but only eight vampires. We find the missing, we'll find-Lucy.' What's the next nearest town? 
HICKS Jericho. It's clear across the Plains. Gonna be a rough ride. 
PRIEST Then you better get a good night's sleep. This bunch was easy, their bloodlines watered down by man. 
(BEAT) Whoever took Lucy was a whole different breed. He tosses another body on the fire, tiny sparks floating into the night as -- 
We hear the Banshee call of a STEAM WHISTLE, sharp and shrill as we CUT TO: 
EXT. DUNKIRK RAIL - NIGHT 
A STEAM LOCOMOTIVE Bearing down like death itself, teeth of the behemoth's grill leering: like a skull. Thick clouds of heavy smoke burst from its blast pipe, rails SQUEALING as the train RACES past. There re no Windows, just an unblinking black juggernaut, midnight willed into.a steel and iron frame. Terrifying. 
INT. TRAIN - CONTINUOUS 
As the cars BLAST PAST THE CAMERA we see each is filled with rows of BLACK COFFINS. A TALL FIGURE walks between them, wearing a BLACK TOP HAT AND CAPE. We only see 12im from behind. PALE ARMS reach from within the coffins, fingers touching the hem of the Figure's cape as he walks past. â¢ A FAMILIAR approaches. 
FAMILIAR A man came on board at the last stop. Says he has something for you. The Figure nods. We-FOLLOW as he continues to the back of --- the car, sliding open the door 
INT. DINING CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Fine china on oak tables. The SNAKE OIL SALESMAN we saw back in Halbridge sits, nervously, in a plush chair. Candles light the car, casting the room in a surreal flicker. 
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN You told me tQ come to you if I had any information. 
(SMILES) I have some. Silently, the Figure sits down across from him. 
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D) But before I tell you...and I hate to bring this, up -- there is the small matter regarding compensation. 
(LEANING FORWARD) 
(MORE) 
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN (CONT'D) Now your group's been REAL good for business so, of course, I'm willing to cut you a deal The Figure suddenly. LUNGES, grabbing the salesman by the throat, teeth clicking inches from the man's neck. WE STILL 
DO NOT SEE HIS FACE. 
BLACK HAT I can SMELL the blood racing through your veins... Smells like dinner. The salesman starts to shake. 
SNAKE OIL SALESMAN 
(VOICE QUAVERING) A-After you snatched that girl outside Haibridge...two nights later -- a Priest s-showed up. 
HICKS Gotta be a desert rat. They park their bikes about twenty feet from the rickety structure, Hicks stepping off his bike and approaching. Carefully. 
HICKS (CONT'D) Let me do the talkin'. The sun has a way of cookin' these people's brains so they ain't quite right - BANG! A rifle shot kicks up dust at Hicks' feet. 
VOICE (0.3.) Hold it right there, mistert Hicks freezes. A BEAT as. the front of the shack shows only a doorway hidden in shadow...thenan OLD MAN emerges, Rifle in hand. He COCKS it, making a bead for Hick's head. 
OLD MAN Take another step and you'll be meetin' the Lord directly. 
HICKS Easy now old timer. I'm a sheriff. The old man snorts, spitting a thick stream of tobacco,. it sizzles when it hits the dust. 
OLD MAN Ain't no law out here but my own. Calm and cool, Priest shifts in his seat, drawing his gaze. 
THE MAN'S EYES WIDEN Seeing Priest clearly now for the first time. 
OLD MAN (CONT'D) Praise The Lord. Total attitude adjustment. He lowers the Rifle and smiles -- revealing a gap tooth smile wide enough to drive a herd of cattle through. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TIN SHACK - DAY 
A dusty PHONOGRAPH playing a recording of an old-time spiritual, the record warped from the heat, distorting the voice as THE CAMERA PANS PAST hundreds of homemade CRUCIFIXES haphazardly nailed across the wall. 
OLD MAN Cleaned the place up a bit. Been years since I had any kind of company 'sides jackrabbits but I knew you was comity' -- Dreams don't lie.' Ignoring Hicks, the old man pours BLACK TEA into a rusty can, handing it to Priest. 
OLD MAN (CON'S I D) Most people don't remember what you folk done -- Don' t WANT to remember. But I do. I know what you can do. (making the sign of the cross) You are God's mighty sword fused into flesh. One of the chosen.. Touched by His very ha nd so peace could finally come to this cur sed land. Hicks snorts. 
HICKS Sounds like a bunch of religious mumbo jumbo to me. The old man stares fixedly at Priest. 
OLD MAN Now you tell the Clergy this here is an authentic miracle, I want it registered. It's mine. 
PRIEST Miracle? 
OLD MAN The Angels. Never seen so many loot souls, breaks my heart just to think of it. This ain't no place for nothin' divine. The man's fevered belief unsettles Priest, he's unsure how to respond. 
PRIEST You saw angels? 
OLD MAN Sure as chit. 
PRIEST How many? 
OLD MAN Don't know, too many to count. Hundreds. Thousands. Some nights the sky was so thick you couldn't see the stars. His eyes suddenly light up, remembering something. i OLD MAN (CONT'D) Here! Look at this -- He goes to a shelf, it's been turned into a MAKESHIFT SHRINE -- rw=ging through a jumbled collection of crucifixes, yellowed photographs, collected junk. He pulls out a GLASS JAR containing SOMETHING MISSHAPEN floating in murky water, the old man proudly showing it to Priest and Hicks. 
HICKS What is it? 
OLD MAN It's their spoor! They'd be flyin' above and this stuff would drop from the sky like manna. 
HICKS That's angel shit? 
OLD MAN Scooped it up myself. (offering it to Hicks) You wanna hold it? Hicks backs away, shaking his head. 
OLD MAN (CONT'D) Suit yourself. Priest still doesn't know what to make of the man but he senses something to be gained. He tries changing the subject. 
PRIEST These angels...di.d you ever see them during the day? 
OLD MAN No, I reckon'. that's when they'd go back home for some shut eye -- Gettin' the world ready for the rapture takes a lot of work. Praise God. 
PRIEST Home? 
OLD MAN The castle - .:,He:points out the window, far away, atop a craggy peak sits the -remains of a CASTLE -- 
Frustrated, Hicks kicks at the garbage. There's something underneath. He brushes aside the refuse, uncovering a . bunch' of SMALL WHITE SHAPES, breath catching as he realizes what it is: Bones. 
INT. CATACOMB - SAME 
It's quiet. Priest moves through the darkness, footsteps not even a whisper, heading deeper and deeper into the labyrinth as 
INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAMB 
Hicks is now at the chamber wall,'running his hand along it, feels grooves lining its surface. Stepping back, he sees they form an image-of some kind. Hard to make it out in the darkness. He leafs through the garbage, pulling out a piece of BROKEN 
GLASS AS 
INT. CATACOMB - SAME 
Priest turns a jagged corner and looks down the longest, most narrow tunnel yet. A light shines at the end. A TORCH. Flickering gently. A SHADOW brushes past the light, moving so fast it barely registers. Could just be a trick of the eye. Or not. Priest moves towards it. 
IT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAME Hicks angles the broken glass under the light, reflecting a faint beam onto the wall, revealing a HUGE CARVING cut into 
THE STONE: 1L0Z.J.PIf .! i Primitive but very creepy. We linger on the image, the terror of the people, the viciousness of the creature. Truly horrific. 
INT. CATACOMB - SAME 
Quiet. Just the low how], of a breeze moving through the tunnel. Priest walks into an ANIMAL PEN of sorts, a hay-like substance covering the floor, the smell of something bestial. He,covers his nose, looking around, something in the corner catching his eye --- 
TWO BODIES splayed across the ground like rag dolls. He crouches to take a closer look... 
WHAM! SOMETHING. barrels into him with superhuman force! Acting on instinct, Priest FOLDS AND ROLLS. Kicking the thing off him and PUSHING off the wall for a blistering recovery. Whatever it is, it's fast. Quickly countering for every move he gives, neither able to get the upper hand. Too dark to make out what it is. Priest locks his arms around the shape's arms, SLAb24=G it against the wall, illuminating it under the torch light. 
IT'S A FEMALE PRIEST 
o A BEAT as they stand staring at each other, unsure what to say. The cross tattoo covers her face, shadowing fierce eyes. Every inch a warrior. Time seems to stop for these two. Their whole dark history their bend -- passing between them in one glance. 
PRIESTESS How did you find me? Priest doesn't reply. She narrows her eyes, suspicious. 
PRIESTESS (CONT'D) Did the Clergy send you? 
PRIEST No. 
(BEAT) Why would they? She nods towards the bodies, we now see tb=1re.-VAMPIRZ- 
CORPSES. 
PRIESTESS I've been busy. Off Priest's reaction we CUT TO: 
INT. CASTLE CHAMBER - SAME TIME 
Hicks looking up to see the light; from the hole in the geilingwinkinc_out. The sun is setting. Slipping, he drops the piece og glass, cutting his finger. Drawing blood. 
HICKS Shit. He wipes the blood on his pants, not noticing as a A LARGE SHAPE looms in the archway behind him... 
INT. CATACOMB - SAME 
The two warriors eye each other, the. air heavy between them. 
PRIESTESS If you didn't come for me...why are you here? 
PRIEST I should be asking you the same question. 
The bestial smell stings their nostrils, smells good. 
CREATURE -- 
ï¿½1ï¿½_ M, .Q A BRIGHT FLASH again -- and now Priest is ON the behemoth, he pulls out the FAMILIAR'S KNIFE, twirling it in his hand -- EVERYTHING GOES BLACx And WHAM1 we fuse back into real time as the creature CRASHES to the ground. Its DECAPITATED HEAD rolling to a stop, face frozen in a horrible rictus. 
A BEAT 
O as the world seems to hold its breath then -- Priest lands in a crouch, dropping next to the Priestess, her hands still locked in the prayer position. She turns to him. 
PRIESTESS Not bad. Suddenly the CREATURE'S BODY erupts into ablistering death spasm! Talons clacking like STRAIGHT RAZORS, flailing dangerously close to the two of them. 
BAMI A single bullet. pierces its heart and the body collapses with a THUD. Once and for all -- dead. ANGLE ON HICKS in the archway, smoke coming off his gun. He looks at the Priests. 
HICKS Point A...meet point fuckin' B. He smiles, twirling his six shooters back into their holsters. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COURTYARD - LATER 
Hicks examining the fallen creature, poking at the carcass with his gun. In some crazy, distant way he's related to this thing. He raises his hand, comparing it to the beast's talon. Shakes his head. 
ATOP THE CASTLE WALL Priest and the Priestess stare out at the Wasteland, uncomfortable with looking at each other. 
PRIEST This was a Pureblood. 
PRIESTESS we both know that's impossible -- They haven't existed for a millennium. 
(BEAT) What's going on here? 
PRIEST .I don't know. A BEAT filled with awkward silence -- when the Priestess ktï¿½ speaks it comes as a relief for both. An unloosening of things long held tight. 
PRIESTESS Sector Seven was the only place I could find work. Waste Management. 
(BEAT) Nobody else would hire me. %No applicable skills.& 
PRIEST I heard that one too. 
PRIESTESS A week ago, a family camping out on the Perimeter approached me --.Told me vampires were terrorizing their village and that the government wouldn't do anything about it. 
PRIEST Did you go to The Clergy? 
PRIESTESS They wouldn't see me, 
(LOOKS DOWN) 
(MORE) 
PRIESTESS (CONT'D) By the time I got to the village it was completely razed. Nothing left. Women. Children. All dead ...they didn't even bother to feed. 
(BEAT) I've been on their trail ever since...could be the same group who took your niece. 
PRIEST Could be. The Priestess glances towards Hicks. 
PRIESTESS Does the lawman know what you'll do if you find her? 
PRIEST He knows. 
PRIESTESS He'll try to stop you. 
PRIEST He won't be able to. She pauses a moment, regarding him. 
HICKS (CONT'D) So what's the trick? 
PRIESTESS No trick. You just have to remember. 
HICKS Remember... what? 
PRIESTESS Time is relative. 
Priest snaps up his hand, cutting off their conversation, something strange up ahead -- He slowly moves forward, the tunnel sharply dropping, feeding into a -- 
HUGE CHAMBER Not like the cave, this is more earthen. Like the inside of a wasp nest, curved walls made of dirt and spit, Priest covering his nose and mouth as he's hit with a massive stench. 
A GIANT SHADOW Looms before him, we_don't see what it is. As the Priestess and Hicks enter the chamber, Hicks coughs, reeling from the smell, the Priestess wrapping a cloth around her mouth -- the CAMERA focusing only on theirexpressions as they take in the horrible spectacle before them. 
PRIEST You said the next nearest town was Jericho. 
HICKS Yeah. 
PRIEST Then we better go see. 
HICKS . See what? 
PRIESTESS -- What they left of it. PUSH IN ON HICKS -- knots of rope tightening in his stomach... only now realizing how truly black the path before him will be. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DUNKIRK RAIL - DAY 
The NIGHT TRAIN thundering across the rails, almost obscene in the bright sunlight. An intruder from the darkness We hear a SCRATCHING sound, something scraping. Heavy breathing as we MOVE INTO... 
INT. ASSEMBLY CAR - SAME 
THE SERVANT FAMILIAR slides the door open, carrying food for Lucy, no tray this time. 
But she's not there. He SCREECHES, dropping the-food as he runs to a HOLE ripped in the wood floor, smatterings of blood around the edges. It's not very big, just enough for a small body to fit through. The Familiar sticks his head through the opening and -,- 
RAILROAD TRACKS CLACK past at a furious speed, inches from his head! The noise is deafening.. 
LUCY (0.S.) Hey... The Familiar turns -- Lucy's perched inside one of the JOISTS lining the underside of the train. KRACKI- She lets loose with a well-placed KICK, snapping his head back so he catches on the track. With ascream, he's quickly SUCKED out the train, pulverized on the track. Lucy's covers her mouth, her nails an ugly bloody mass. She's come this far, time to go the rest. She manages to carefully crawl from joist to joist, moving along the underside of the train, her body just centimeters from the passing track. 
OHB SLIPS Catching herself just in time. Her eyelids practically brushing the wood. Taking a deep breath, she manages to hoist herself through the rest of the way finally making it to the CABOOSE. She pulls herself up onto the back of the car. Now what? The train is blazing past the wasteland at an incredible speed. Only one thing to do. She makes the sign of the cross, closes her eyes and JUMPS 
EXT WASTELAND (EDGE OF THE PLAINS) - DAY A dustorm. The plain's a shifting veil of sand, parting to reveal a vista of dunes, wind shipping across them. 
As quickly as it opened the veil closes again, shifting to reveal OUR TRIO plowing through, blast goggles and respirators covering their faces. The Priestess riding a cycle identical to Priest's. In the distance we can make out a cluster of structures as they arrive at Jericho. 
EXT. JERICHO - DAY 
Riding into town. The storm making it difficult to see anything as they idle onto main street. It's deserted -- The only sound a saloon door creaking noisily in the wind. Ominous signs left in the vampires' wake are everywhere -- 
BROKEN DOORS, SHATTERED WINDOWS, OVERTURNED VEHICLES. 
PRIEST We separate. Go through each building, see what we find. 
HICKS I'll start with the sheriff. 
PRIESTESS Be careful. Just because it's daylight doesn't mean it's safe. Hicks nods, tightening the twin BANDOLEERS across his chest. 
EXT. JAIL DAY 
PRIESTESS The same thing as us. 
(BEAT) Someone's drawing us out. 
HICKS Who? The Priests just stare into the fire, not having any idea. 
HICKS (CONT'D) I imagine you'll have to go back to the Cities, inform the Clergy. A sudden silence. 
PRIEST We're not going back. 
The Priestess looks at him, he speaks for her as well but she's still shocked to hear the words out loud. A lifetime of conditioning.. 
PRIESTESS We'll burn for this. 
PRIEST (looking at the pyre) We already are. Something in the flames catches the Priestess's eye, in the charred remains of one of the corpses -- SOMETHING'S GLOWING. She wraps her arm, plunging her hand through the bones, pulling out the object. Quickly, she tosses it into a'barrel of water. it hisses, steam rising as it cools. Priest reaches into the barrel, his hand emerging with a 
METAL SPIKE. 
HICKS It's a railroad spike. My pop used to work boxcars before they shut down -- Why the hell would anyone wanna swallow that? A beat as Priest puts it together. 
PRIEST He wanted us to find it. It's a clue. 
PRIESTESS Where's the closest track? 
CUT TO. 
INT. JAIL DAY 
Hicks pulls a LARGE MAP off the wall, blowing off a layer of dust, drawing a line across the paper with his finger. 
HICKS The Dunkirk Line. It starts all the way in the backcountry, bought the ore from the deep mines. There were about five stops along the route. I think. He draws several Xs along the line. His hand coming to a stop on a particular forboding PATCH OF MOUNTAINS. 
HICKS (CONT'D) Looks like Jericho was, the last town it glances before'. heading around the Linwood Mountains...Then it goes to the last stop. 
PRIEST Where? He draws one final X at the end of the line. Looks up. 
HICKS The Cities. So there it is. The Priestess narrows her eyes. 
PRIESTESS They must have been picking up different factions along the way. Moving during the day, feeding at night. 
HICKS But headin' to the Cities is suicide. The sun will kill `em -- there's nowhere to hide. Priest gazes at the map, deeply troubled. 
PRIEST They won't have to. And with the SHRIEK of the train whistle we CUT TO: 
EXT. WASTELAND (DUNKIRK RAIL) - DAY 
The Night Train barreling down the track, blasting along on its grim trajectory. Suddenly -- 
THE CAMERA Overtakes the train. Snaking along the rail at an incredible speed, leaving the train in its tracks (sorry) as it blisters across the Wasteland through craggy mountains and finally ending up in 
THE CITIES. And it is only now that we see exactly what Priest means. THICK CLOUD OF INDUSTRIAL SMOKE covers the metropolis. There is no sun. 
CUT TO:

Headlight crossbeams leading the way, their cycles navigate the twisty trail, cutting across sheer canyon walls, teetering on the brink of an abyss, rock slides a constant threat. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS CAMP - LATE NIGHT 
They've set up camp for the night on the lip of a ridge. Hicks and the Priestess sit by a fire dunking their feet in a nearby stream, the wear and tear of their journey evident on the sheriff's face. Priest lies close by, asleep. 
HICKS If we push it hard we'll gain two days on 'em. Should be enough to get us a jump. 
PRIESTESS We'need more than a jump. We need a miracle. 
HICKS That's the funny thing about time -- He dips his hand in the water and raises it, letting the liquid leak from between his fingers. 
HICKS (CONT'D) It's always runin' right through my fingers. 
PRIESTESS You should try harder, sheriff. She cups her hand in the water, bringing it to her lips for a drink. Hicks smiles, leaning forward, something on his mind. 
HICKS You ever regret it? Bein' a Priest? 
PRIESTESS No. 
HICKS What about a husband, children...A family? 
PRIESTESS I've had a family -- just not the kind you're familiar with. 
Hicks glances at Priest. 
HICKS What? You mean Mr. Laffs over there? 
PRIESTESS He's not so bad once you get to know him. A beat, Hick's expression becoming serious. 
HICKS He's going to kill her, isn't he? If. she's turned. 
PRIESTESS Yes. 
HICKS There's things that can be done. She doesn't have to die. 
PRIESTESS She's his bloodline... and he's a Priest. It's the only way. Hicks tosses the rest of his food into the fire, troubled, but he knows there's no point in discussing it any further... for now. 
HICKS And how many of you Priests are left now? A long moment before she speaks. 
PRIESTESS Two. Hicks doesn't know what to Say-,, 
HICKS .I'm sorry., 
PRIESTESS Yes. She nods, though in affirmation of what Hicks's isn't sure. He watches her as she stares'into the fire. We FADE TO BLACK: 
INT. VAMPIRE HIVE - DREAM SEQUENCE/FLASHEIACK 
It's dark. 
A GROUP OF PRIESTS (OUR TWO amongst them) move silently through a DEEP TRENCH, moist earthen walls rising around them, the air putrid with stink, mud clinging to their feet. Last: in the line, is a particularly FEARSOME PRIEST ...unlike the others, he's smiling, enjoying the action. As a cohesive unit, the Priests, climb up from the trench, scaling through the muck. They find themselves at the base of the hive, looking around at a chilling sight -- 
THOUSANDS OF HONEYCOMBS stretching endlessly, rising high above in a cone. THOUSANDS 
OF SLEEPING VAMPIRES. OUR PRIEST, motions with his hand to the others, giving precise instructions, their movements well coordinated. He stops. Hearing a sound...a faint but incr. A BEAT as the Priestess looks at the others. 
PRIESTESS They know we're here. From under the earth A HAND SHOOTS UP, grabbing onto a Priest's leg, pulling him down. Suddenly DOZENS OF VAMPIRES emerge, seemingly birthed from the soil. The warriors fight valiantly. Fiercely. But it's too much. Most are quickly cut down. 
EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS, DAWN 
A blanket of mist covers everything in a grey haze. Morning has come. 
A QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS As our trio forges onward and upward, the trail more treacherous with every twisty ridge, the overhangs looming ominously as they head deeper into the mountain. 
EXT. BEGGAR'S PASS - LATER 
The final climb. Yawning crevices, the wind moaning as it whistles between the canyon walls. Carefully they ride across DEVIL'S BRIDGE, a finger of stone, just wide enough for the cycles, on either side a straight drop to, oblivion. The peak of the mountain Just ahead. 
The Priestess is in front leading the charge, closely followed by Hicks. Priest brings up the rear, he stops just past the bridge, looks around. Something's wrong. 
HICKS I- ee itl Hicks points, reaching the top of the mountain. 
IN THE DISTANCE A long black line snakes along the rail, puffs of heavy smoke lining its path; The Night Train. They're ahead of it. Barely. In his excitement, Hicks thunders ahead, starting the descent down the other side. The Priestess turns to shout back to Priest. But he's gone. Off her reaction we CUT TO: 
EXT. CREVASSE - DAY 
Tall rock walls flank Priest on. either side, the surrounding mist hanging in the air in cloudlike wisps. Slowly he walks through the canyon, senses fully attuned. It's quiet. 
PRIEST I know you're there. A slight sound, the mist whipping into a pool as if something just moved through it. Priest quickly turns but there's nothing there. 
A GROUP OF ROCKS Tumble down the cliff. Again Priest abruptly turns but...still nothing there. 
PRIEST (CONT'D) Show yourself. A BEAT as he stands in the ether, waiting. Then -- WHOOSH! Qurye -M onen. ieadjna straight-for pi=. 
Just in time -- he DIVES, the claw BITING into a rock behind him, the chain quickly snapping back, disappearing into the fog. 
RU11TE (O. S. ) (voice like the mist itself) I've waited a long time for this Priest. 
PRIEST This isn't the time to settle old scores, Rune. 
RUNE (0. S. ) I disagree... This is the perfer, time. WOOSH! Like lightning, the claw LASHES out, appearing from. nowhere. Priest JUMPS and it CHOMPS into the ground where he was standing. He lands on top of the chain, backflipping as it retracts back. Gearing up for another attack. RUNE (0.s.) (CONT'D) You've lost a step Priest...I never came this close before. 
PRIEST I'm older now. We can almost bear Rune smile. 
RUNE (0.8.) Not me. And now THE CHAIN comes from a different direction, WRAPPING around Priest like a snake, the metal cutting into his body, snapping a ribt Yelling, Priest GRABS the chain, PULLING with everything he's got. Rune flies from the mist, dragged by Priest, crashing at his feet. The chain SNAPS and Priest BREAKS from the coils, grabbing Rune by the jacket, picking him up. Rune flashes his fangs and scissors his legs across Priest's stomach, the razor sharp roweled SPURS slicing his flesh, tearing the muscle, Priest SCREAMS, a hot rush of, blood staining the desert floor. Rune leaps away, landing ontop a boulder. 
RUNE (CONT'D) You can't outrun the past, Priest... the things you did. 
PRIEST It was a war, Rune. 
RUNE It still is He launches at Priest, duster fluttering like wings. The two grapple, Rune's fangs brushing Priest's neck. It's a savage battle, Priest's muscles and laser-like focus the only thing keeping him alive as Rune flies back across the canyon, landing against the rock wall like.a spider. Hunched, ready to strike BUT -- 
THE PRIESTESS Appears from within the mist, already in mid-leap, she lands beside Priest. The two together, a formidable presence. But Rune's a tough customer, he readies himself for another attack. ough h2 mist a single CLICKING sound. Rune looks over, sees -- 
HICKS Six-shooter pointed right at him. 
A beat as the two sides stare at each other in standoff. The air between them vibrating with energy. Crackling. Rune considering his options. 
RUNE (CONP' D) 
(HISSING) Another time, Priest. He skitters up the rock face, disappearing into the mist. 
HAM! Hicks fires a single shot, the echo ringing through the canyon. 
RUNE'S BODY Drops from the fog, hitting the ground with a thud. Dead. And now Hicks turns -- points his revolver at Priest. Catching both he and the Priestess by surprise. 
HICKS Tell me you won't kill her. Priest doesn't reply. 
WE HEAR A HUM Molecules and electrons bursting from their orbits, the roar of the train gently subsiding as if the universe itself wants to leave these two room to battle. And before anyone knows it, they're already mid-fight. The SLAM and COLLISION of bodies giving way to the graceful sweep and echo of Priest combat. 
Then as combustibly fast as it started -- the tableau drops. They stand, wind whipping around them in lethal currents, Black Hat having to shout to be heard. 
BLACK HAT They taught us God created man in His image. . .but they lied. Man created God in a image -- And so, like man, God is weak. Corrupt. Merciless. He wipes away a streak of blood from his cheek. 
BLACK HAT (CONT'D) Who do you fight for, Priest? The Order's collapsed. The Church nothing but a line of decrepit, ruined old men. Charlatans. 
(SMILES) How do you think I'm getting into the cities? Priest's face drops. 
PRIEST I don't believe you. 
BLACK HAT Your faith has failed you Priest. 
(BEAT) Join me. Join me and have the best of both worlds --Walk in the sun. Stalk in the night. Why pray to a God when you can BE one? 
PRIEST With ferocious instinct, he launches forward, feet digging into the metal. The two bodies COLLIDE w th Mic impact. Rolling across the roof, bodies twisting to the edge before FLIPPING onto the next car. The warriors rise, locked in a furious coil.as WHOOSHI train car after train car passes beneath them. Each leaping at j ust the right moment to land onto the next. But Priest is,outmatched. As they hit the final car, Priest flies across the roof catching the edge with his hand just before he goes over, his body dangling over the side. Exhausted and bloodied. 
Black Hat calmly approaches, his foot dangerously close to Priest's hand. The landscape below-whipping past at an incredible speed. 
BLACK HAT Your problem is you keep looking to God for-your power -- But I know the real truth. 
(BEAT) You've been praying to an empty sky. And now he SWIPES his foot across the roof, knocking off Priest's hand as one would swat a bug. Priest falls below, getting caught under the train and quickly dragged under. 
BLACK HAT (CONT' D) But you know that now. 
CROSSCUT TO: 
EXT. TRAIN - SAME TIME 
The Priestess, cycle at full throttle, racing beside the TRAIN ENGINE. Up close it's a real mechanical monster, black metal and heat fused into a superpowered nightmare. The hull completely covered. Impervious. 
MASSIVE PISTONS Pump up and down furiously, moving so fast they blur, turning the-giant DRIVE WHEELS that power the locomotive. ANGRY BLASTS OF STEAM vent whi te hot from between the wheels, just missing the Priestess. She reaches into her pack and lugs out a CROWBAR, pulling up to the beast and managing to stick it between the pistons hoping to jam up the works. The machine chews it up like candy. 
CROSSCUT TO: 
INT. TRAIN COFFIN CAR - SAME TIME 
Hicks is almost at the door, hand reaching for the handle. He hears a RUSTLING sound and turns to look behind him... But there's nothing, just the open coffins. Turning back, Hicks catches his breath: 
A VAMPIRE hangs upside down from the ceiling, blocking the door. Its red eyes snap in anticipation, a shiny BLACK PROBOSCIS darting from its mouth! Hicks SPITS a wad of ATOMIC CRAW at the creature. It RIEKSI dropping to the floor, writhing. The sick smell of cooked flesh filling the car. 
HICKS LOOKS BEHIND HIM DOZENS OF VAMPIRES ARE NOW AWAKE. Sitting up in their coffins, the foul creatures all blood-eyeing Hicks like the dinner he most surely is. 
HICKS Shit. With a WAIL, the vampires quickly scramble from their coffins, sharp talons scratching at the wood, snapping the planks. Desperate, he wrenches open the door, darting into -- 
INT. STEEL ENCLOSURE - CONTINUOUS 
and manages to SLAM the door behind him just in time as the hungry beings CRASH against itl 
A He wedges a knife in the door-handle, bashing it with his revolver, jamming the door trapped shut. He turns to head to the next car but there's a THICK CHAIN AND PADLOCK wrapped around the door, aWILD-EYED FAMILIAR peering out from inside the door window. Hicks SHOOTS the padlock but no luck, it doesn't break. He's trapped. 
THE DOOR BEHIND HICKS BUCKLES ON ITS HINGES It'll hold. . .but not for long. 
EXT. UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN - SAME TIME 
Priest is still alive. Barely. He hangs in tatters, desperately clinging to the undercarriage, face and body punched with bruises and blood. Jaw set, he begins to move through the undercarriage, hand over hand, every movement sheer agony. 
INT. METAL ENCLOSURE - SAME TIME 
Lucy, don't do this! The girl's just too fast. She keeps pushing him backwards until he's dangerously close to the vampire's clawing hands.. Hick's closes his eyes, knowing this is it... 
A FIST PUNCHES through a BOARDED UP HOLE in the floor (the one through which Lucy escaped before), wood splintering into tiny shards. Hicks takes advantage of the distraction and SLUGS Lucy, knocking her unconscious. He dives for his gun, scooping it up and leveling it at the hole, ready to fire at whatever's coming through... 
IT'S PRIEST He sticks his head through the opening, having been drawn by the sound of gunfire. Hicks can't believe it. 
PRIEST (reaching for Lucy) Give her to me! Hurry! 
Hicks thinks about it, unsure. 
PRIEST (CONT'D) -- They'11.get through the door any second! Give her to mei Screeching, ANOTHER VAMPIRE makes it through the opening, Hicks quickly taking him down in one crack shot. He picks Lucy up, handing her to Priest. Priest disappears with her, Hicks climbing down behind just as -- the chain finally SNAPS and the door BURSTS open with screeching vampires! Hicks BLASTS away but there's too many of them, they keep coming. He drops into the hole -- 
EXT. UNDERNEATH THE TRAIN - CONTINUOUS 
Landing in the undercarriage. Coming face to face with the speeding track, everything shaking like an earthquake. 
A VAMPIRE Jabs its head through the hole, teeth chattering-- but the creature can't go any further, the sunlight already making its skin smoke. On his back, Hicks worms his way down,. following Priest.as they climb up a LADDER attached to the side of the train. 
EXT. TRAIN CONTINUOUS' 
They work their way up the side, making it to the roof, exhausted. Priest carrying the still unconscious Lucy. 
HICKS We should jump! 
PRIEST Not until we stop the trains But now Hicks isn't even looking at him, his attention caught up in the horrible sight waiting ahead of them. 
HICKS 
(SWALLOWS) Too late. 
THE CITYSCAPE 
t Towers above as the train approaches, so close the smell of sulphur and carbon clogs their noses. But that's when something catches Hicks' eye...up ahead on the tracks -- Someone stands. awaiting the train. IT'S THE PRIESTESS -- Standing defiant as the train barrels towards her. An ant in front of a battleship. She sees Hicks and Priest-on top of the train, Lucy with them. Taking one last look at Priest -- she smiles. And spreads her arms open. 
ON PRIEST Horrified, realizing what she's going to do...and powerless to stop her. 
PRIEST What happens next happens fast: Priest GRABS Hicks, folding his body around both he and Lucy, hands coming together in prayer, feet leaving the train as -- E ERYTH ggas BLACK The sound of a heartbeat.A threshold. A zone of transition. A BRIGHT FLASH -- we see the TRAIN collide with the. Priestess. The massive grill of the engine CRUMPLING AROUND HER as if smashing into a building. She doesn't move. A BRIGHT FLASH -- one by one the train cars SLAM into each other, the cars JUMPING the rails. MMMM gQES BLACK A BRIGHT FLASH -- and now Priest is falling through the air, his body shielding Hicks and Lucy, train care skipping across the earth, careening through the air. 
And WHAM! we FUSE back into real time as train cars CRASH down, sheets of dust clouding the sky in a roiling storm of debris and shrapnel, until finally...it all comes to a stop. It's quiet. We move through the swirling sand until we find -- 
PRIEST He stands, bruised and bloody, staring at the sky. Watching. A dazed Hicks beside him, Lucy in his arms as she comes to. A HORRENDOUS SCREECH fills the air. Led by the Purebloods, HUNDREDS OF VAMPIRES fly out from within the broken cars, taking to the sky in a massive black swarm, tangling together in flowing shapes. Beautiful. Terrifying. Then in one horrible instant -- They TURN as if guided by an unseen hand, flying towards the Cities. Sensing the blood that awaits. 
HICKS 
(HORRIFIED) They're gonna make it. The creatures arctowards the metropolis,the city within 
THEIR REACH: Priest studies the sky and all at once...he knows. 
PRIEST No, they're not. 
THE SUN PUNCHES through the teeming mass. A few rays at first, but then more and more,-cracking through the black tide like shattered glass. Hicks' eyes, widen, witnessing an amazing eight as the vampires' bodies collectively BLACKEN and SHRIVEL the swarm withering... quickly becoming nothing more than husks. Floating black kites. Hicks and Priest stand, surrounded by the epic destruction, fire and smoke casting everything in a surreal haze. 
HICKS You knew they wouldn't make it. A long time before Priest answers. 
PRIEST She knew. He turns to THE ENGINE -- its grinning teeth grill CAVED IN as if smashed by the very hand of God. 
THE PRIESTESS Lies before it. Somehow not a scratch on her...But something's wrong -- something inside her broken, something elemental. She doesn't have much time. Priest kneels beside her, taking her hand. Trying to be strong for her. 
PRIEST (CONT'D) Do you want me to? 
ORELAS Ecces Agnes Dei, ecces qui tollit peccata mundi. 
THERE'S A LOUD CRASH Everyone turns to see the massive chamber doors BURSTING inwards! THE BODIES OF TWO GUARDS skidding across the marble floor. 
PRIEST ENTERS THE CHAMBER A true force of nature now, coming like the Fourth Horseman. Grief and betrayal stoking his anger higher, a blaze igniting behind his eyes. 
BLACK HAT 
Steps from the shadows. Deep wounds line his face, the cross tattoo now gouged and distorted with blood -- He smiles. 
BLACK HAT I'm afraid you're too late, Priest. 
THE MONSIGNORS Shed their robes, revealing fresh BITE MARKS on their necks. Orelas' new-found fangs glint in the candlelight. 
ORELAS And why shouldn't we live forever? 
(HISSES) We're God's very voice. His vessel! 
PRIEST Stands shell shocked, the level of betrayal staggering. 
BLACK HAT ATTACKS SLAMMING.into him, the two warriors going at it in a brutal battle, the vampire raking his claws across Priest's face, drawing blood. 
PRIEST Sends him sailing through the air, Black Hat crashing into a collection of CANDLE HOLDERS, an ancient TAPESTRY catching fire, flames quickly spreading to the other fabrics -- The chamber erupting in an orange blaze! 
THE MONSIGNORS SHRIEK Bodies contorting in grotesque shapes as they BECOME. Black Hat stands triumphant, flames rising behind him. 
BLACK HAT With them I can start anew! You can't stop it -- 
(SMILES) Must be God's will. He flies across the room, BARRELING into Priest with everything he's got, DIGGING a hand into Priest's wound. 
BLACK HAT (CONT'D) "I looked and beheld a pale horse and His name that sat on him was Death" -- 
Priest coughs up blood. Black Hat smiles, wrapping a hand around Priest's. throat, LIFTING him off the floor, SQUEEZING the life from him, 
BLACK HAT (CONT'D) "And all hell followed with him." He raises his head back, ready to sink his teeth. Priest too exhausted to fight back. This is it. Prom a b= -- 
THE GIANT GOLD CROSS Breaks from the wall with a GROAN, PLUMMETING towards them. Black Hat stops, his eyes snapping upward. At the last second -- 
PRIEST WRENCHES himself from,Black Hat's grip, tumbling. across the floor. WHAPI The cross S LM onto Black Hat, pulverizing hi ! 
Chunks of glass and stone rain down around Priest, the chamber starting to COLLAPSE. Diving, he barely makes it out, the rotunda .CRASHING down behind him., The Monsignors lunge but Priest manages to jam the doors shut, locking them in. They BASH against the door, SHRIEKING horribly, the chamber now an oven. Priest presses against the door, it SPLINTERS all around him, the terrible sound RISING until finally it stops. 
PRIEST 
(WHISPERS) Forgive me. He collapses, making the sign of the cross. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CLERGY CATHEDRAL - MOMENTS LATER 
Complete chaos.

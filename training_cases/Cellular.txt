TITLES OVER YELLOW BACKGROUND. We PULL BACK to reveal we're looking at THE SUN. In the distance lie the gorgeous San Gabriel Mountains and the Downtown Los Angeles skyline. In ONE LONG TRACKING SHOT, we CRANE PAST some trees to reveal the vast expansive homes scattered in the hills of Brentwood. HOMEOWNERS walk dogs, a PAPERBOY chucks papers fr9m a gleaming mountain bike... It's early in the morning, and the landscapers haven't come with their leaf blowers yet. CONTINUE BOOMING DOWN to road level to face    the resplendent Martin residence. We STEADICAM down the fr    ont walk, able to admire the manicured hedges and the black E   scalade in the driveway, to the front door decorated with    a whimsical placard that reads, "The Martins" -- and we    pass THROUGH THE KEYHOLE into the foyer. 
INT. JESSICA'S HOUSE - MORNING We TRACK through the living room, passing framed photos of an athletic eleven year old boy, and we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE as she comes down the stairs with a GOLDEN RETRIEVER at her side. 
WOMAN (into phone) Yes Donna, I'm out the door. We TRACK over the Woman's shoulder and follow her into the kitchen, unable to see her face. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) Just inform Kayleigh that anesthesia is on the way to prep the epidural and I'll be there as soon as I can. Still looking over her shoulder, we watch her absently straighten a PHOTOGRAPH of her son on the fridge as she talks. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) And promise her she's about to have a woooonnderful labor. As the woman pours herself a fresh cup of coffee, her HOUSEKEEPER enters the kitchen with a full laundry basket. They give each other a silent wave. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) Right, I'll see you in twenty. She hangs up her cordless and takes a breath as we COME AROUND to finally REVEAL JESSICA MARTIN; slightly weary, but ready for the day ahead. 
JESSICA Buenas dias, Rosario. 
ROSARIO Good morning Miss Jessica. Jessica sees her answering machine blinking, hits PLAY. In the background, a cheerful Rosario enters frame and heads for the back door carrying the basket of laundry. 
MALE VOICE (on machine) Honey? Honey, wake up.   Pick up the- And as she brings the coffee cup to her lips-- SLAMM!! The door EXPLODES open and a squad of FIVE GUNMEN storm in, wearing SKI-MASKS. Everything is a whirlwind of quick cuts, noise and confusion. Jessica's DOG starts to lunge at the men and -- thup! -- is stilled by a silenced pistol before its second bark. Rosario runs for the ALARM SYSTEM -- 
LEAD GUNMAN Get away from there! Don't touch that -- !! -- but as she reaches out for the PANIC BUTTON -- BLAM!!     He blows her away, too. The Gunman curses, then turns on Jessica. 
LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D) (dire) Where is he? Jessica cringes. 
JESSICA Where is who? 
LEAD GUNMAN Wrong answer. The bastard hauls back and -- WHAM I -- punches her in the face, knocking Jessica cold. Then he turns to his men. 
LEAD GUNMAN (CONT'D) Search the house. And as the answering machine fills the silence: 
CRAIG VO (on machine) -I'll call back later. The LEAD GUNMAN spins around, and we PUSH INTO the blackness of his masked face. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
EXT. KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE - DAY The BLACKNESS of a BLACK VAN and ESCALADE passing below us. We quickly CRANE DOWN to see the vehicles traveling through: An IRON GATE at the edge of an aband9ned property. They bounce down a long lonely driveway lined with barren trees-- ANGLE ON: THE KIDNAPPERS' VAN as it arrives at its destination; an isolated HOUSE in the Hills. The grass is dead. The trees are dead. It's the kind of place you could scream for a week and no one would hear a thing. As the van stops-- 
WE PUSH INTO ITS DOORS: 
INT. DARKENED ATTIC - KIDNAPPERS' SAFEHOUSE A door CRASHES open. Light slices through the dark revealing the dusty, skeletal interior. Jessica is hurled into the room and falls to the floor. With bound hands, she frantically pulls her blindfold off to see-- 
THE LEAD SKI-MASKED KIDNAPPER Standing in front of her.    Sturdier than the rest.   Solid. Imposing. 
JESSICA Wh... what do you want? Unsettlingly, the Kidnapper says nothing, staring at her. Jessica tries to remain calm under his angry gaze... Then suddenly, the Kidnapper turns and exits the room. Jessica breathes a sigh of relief...but it catches in her throat as he returns ten seconds later -- with a BASEBALL BAT. Grim as death, he stalks toward her -- 
JESSICA (CONT'D) No, wait.. And reaching.her, he hauls back and SWINGS -- 
JESSICA (CONT'D) 
NO!   PLEASE--// SMASH! The bat connects with a wooden beam an inch above Jessica's head, OBLITERATING the ROTARY DIAL TELEPHONE that hung there. As phone guts shower down on her, the Lead Kidnapper turns and stomps away, slamming the attic door shut and locking Jessica in the darkness. Only now that they're gone does Jessica allow her fear to show through. Trembling, tears running down her face, Jessica finally breaks down, pleading to the empty attic-- 
JESSICA (CONT'D) Wha... what the hell is happening?! The attic's suffocating silence is the only answer she gets. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE OCEAN Skimming along the water. And we TILT UP to reveal the majestic beaches of Southern California, and at the center of it all, the SANTA MONICA 
PIER. 
EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - MORNING - ESTABLISHING It would be a typical day, except for that some PEOPLE are preparing for a "HEAL THE BAY" rally at the end of the pier. VENDORS set up, preparing for the daily grind ahead. BIKERS gather around a bad-ass HELLCAT G2 CONFEDERATE MOTORCYCLE and admire its cutting-edge design. HOT CHICKS in bikinis try on sunglasses at a stand. FISHERMEN crack beers while awaiting the next bite. 
CHLOE Chloe. The handshake lingers a second longer than necessary, and they both smile at each other. Chad splits. 
CHLOE (CONT'D) I can't tell if you're full of it. Ryan stops posturing, gets real. 
RYAN You ever go up to Santa Barbara? My dad used to take me there all 
RYAN (CONT'D) the time. Their pier is amazing, clear water, huge crabs everywhere, oysters right there on the rocks, starfish... Hard to believe it's the same ocean sometimes. He's managed to win her back. 
CHLOE Maybe you and I can take a break later when Pat Benatar goes on. 
RYAN Sounds like a plan. There's a moment...     Then -- 
CHLOE Oh no -- I forgot. I still have to pick up a box of T-shirts at the Kinkos on Venice. 
RYAN I'll do it for you... if you want. 
CHLOE Seriously, you would? 
RYAN Sure.     How much is the bill? 
CHLOE Nothing.    It's been paid up front. 
RYAN Do you promise not to go anywhere? 
CHLOE Done. Ryan makes a graceful exit.       Turns back. 
RYAN Okay, I won't be long. 
CHLOE (laughing) Bye. Ryan grabs Chad, and as they walk out of earshot: 
RYAN Dude, does Santa Barbara have a harbor or a pier? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. VENICE - DAY A short time later, Ryan cruises through a Venice neighborhood. 
Ryan drives an early 70's Ford Bronco; clothes are strewn across the backseat, and a box of "Heal the Bay" T-SHIRTS now sits on the shotgun seat. Ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush. He sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing. Checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa, and grabs the cellphone. 
RYAN (into phone) Dex, wassup? You won't believe the hotties I just met at the pier. Smoking. You wanna meet them? Yeah? Well don't get too excited 'cause I need my money. Ryan stops at a red light. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Bullshit, you're not going anywhere, (quickly adding) I'm pulling up right now. Some AMBULANCES SPEED BY, SIRENS BLARING.   It's deafening. Ryan lays on the horn.   When the light changes, Ryan peels away angrily. 
RYAN (CONT'D) (covering his ear) What? Yeah, you better be. And I need your shower, I'm talkin' code red stankage- The CELLPHONE begins to CRACKLE with STATIC just as Ryan drives under an OVERPASS. Suddenly -- The car ahead of him STOPS in the middle of the street. Ryan notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. The car skids, he SCREAMS... and comes to a stop an inch before hitting the other car's bumper. He lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is WASHED 
WITH STATIC. 
RYAN (CONT'D) (into phone) Dex? You still there...? And as has happened to all of us, he loses the call. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Damn. 
EXT. HIGHWAY OVERPASS - MOMENTS LATER                           10 As traffic resumes and Ryan clears the overpass-- 
ID                                                                   iu 
SFX:   THE CELLPHONE RINGS. Ryan picks up the phone. 
RYAN Sorry, got cut off.      Hey -- what's my Caller ID say? But there's no voice on the other end, only shuffling sounds. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Yo Dex...? 
MATCH CUT TO: 
11   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          11 
ECU - A TANGLE OF PHONE WIRES 12   Their insulation picked off and spliced together. PAN ALONG 12 the attic floor, past the rubble of the shattered phone, foll9wing the crudely repaired wires to JESSICA'S HANDS, tapping the dialer wires together. She's trying so hard to simulate a NUMERIC PULSE that she almost doesn't hear: 
INTERCUT CALL - RYAN IN CAR/JESSICA IN ATTIC                    19 
JESSICA (VO) --an you hear me?! 
RYAN You still there? You're getting kinda creepy, lady. See ya. 
JESSICA No!    Don't! They're going to kill me!    They're going to kill me!! A silent beat.   A calculated look in her eyes... RYAN pulls the phone from his ear and is about to hang up...when he hears the one sound that stops all men cold. On the other end, Jessica begins to CRY. 
RYAN Oh, it's like that, huh?     Nice with the fake tears, lady... 
JESSICA Please...   I just need help. But Ryan won't be manipulated. 
RYAN You need acting lessons. Now go take your meds and bug someone else. 
JESSICA These men!!!-- Jessica stops herself short, quieting the rising hysteria in her voice before it gives her away. She glances anxiously at the attic door, then continues, more in control. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) These men killed my housekeeper. My dog. You have to help me. Ryan bristles at being saddled with anything, much less this. 
RYAN No, actually( I don't. Not with a hot chick waiting for me at the pier. 
JESSICA Please...you're my only hope. (beat) What's your name? That catches Ryan off-guard.   He stalls, not wanting to make this personal. 
RYAN Why, you writing a book--? 
19                                                                  x? 
JESSICA --Please, just tell me your name! Ryan glances around the street, his eyes falling on a stone fountain outside a French Restaurant. 
RYAN Uh...Johnny. Johnny Fountain. 
JESSICA Johnny... What if it was your mother who was calling for help? How would you feel? 
RYAN Well, I'd be damn impressed, considering she's dead. 
JESSICA Goddamn it, how difficult is it to hand this phone off to the police?! I'll pay you! 
RYAN How much? 
JESSICA Five thousand dollars. 
RYAN Sure you will. I'm hanging up now. 
JESSICA No, wait! WAIT!! Even if there's a eighty percent chance I'm lying, you nave a one in five chance to make five grand f9r a lousy twenty minutes of your life. (panics as Ryan is silent) Haven't you ever bet on a horse or bought a Lottery ticket? I'm talking one-in-five odds, twenty minutes. Ryan slaps the radio off. 
RYAN What do you want me to do? 
CUT TO: 
20   INT. 15TH PRECINCT - STATION DESK - DAY                        20 
SOMEONE'S POV. In EXTREME SLOW-MOTION, chaos unfolds around us like a nightmare -- OFFICERS manhandle a drunk toward the back, a HOOKER screams at us with unholy rage, in the far corner, a JUNKIE spits on 
an OFFICER'S FACE and there's a lethal race for disinfectant through invisible soup. Sounds are distant, eerily muffled.      A HIGH-PITCHED WHINE lets us know we're in hell. CLOSE UP:    BOB MOONEY'S EYES.    Concerned, but not panicked. MOONEY'S POV. Still surreal, SLOW-MOTION, as an Officer with a CREWCUT responds by spinning the Junkie's face into a wall, legal but hard. SFX:   A HEARTBEAT.    OURS.    FAST... And possibly IRREGULAR? CLOSE UP - SLOW MOTION - The RIGHT THUMB presses into the 
LEFT WRIST. MOONEY'S EYES.      Watching.   Counting... Suddenly -- WHAM!! Back to reality when a YOUNG GANGBANGER is slammed into the station desk by a ROOKIE. 
ROOKIE OFFICER Problem, Mooney. If I put this one in with the others, there's gonna be a bloodbath. 
GANGBANGER Put me in there! I'll waste all them pussies! REVEAL SERGEANT BOB MOONEY -- a tough, fifty-something beat cop who's fighting growing old every step of the way. He rolls his eyes at the situation and takes a bite of PIZZA. 
MOONEY Come on Powell, put the Sharks with the Sharks, the Jets with the Jets and make room. Rookie Powell suppresses his irritation and roughly yanks the Gangbanger back over to the holding cells. Mooney puts down the pizza, no appetite, and stares at the news story playing on the TV mounted in the corner. 
21   ON THE TELEVISION                                                 21 a NEWS REPORTER is in the middle of a segment. Over him, FOOTAGE rolls of six guilty-looking cops testifying in court; being led away in handcuffs. 
NEWS REPORTER ...was somber when the indictments came down this afternoon in the 23rd Precinct corruption scandal. Though the names of six police officers were read aloud, the District Attorney stated that this was merely the "tip of the iceberg" and that unfortunately many other arrests are likely to be coming as the investigations proceed. 
Ryan reluctantly takes the phone back as more people converge on the Station Desk. 
27   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          27 Jessica hears the phone being shuffled around. 
RYAN (VO) Where? 
JESSICA Hello?    Officer? Hello?! 
28   BACK TO POLICE STATION                                          28 Mooney, recognizing an emergency when he hears one, ignores the incoming CROWD him long enough to assist Ryan. 
MOONEY Up the stairs, Tomlin! Ryan turns away, and as he returns the cellphone to his ear, he's startled to hear-- 
JESSICA (VO) (terrified) Oh my God... 
RYAN What? What is it? 
CUT TO: 
29   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                          29 Jessica hears: 
SFX: FOOTSTEPS.     RIGHT OUTSIDE HER DOOR. 
RYAN (VO) Lady, what's going on?! Jessica drops the phone. Has just enough time to shove it behind her before -- SLAM! -- the attic door swings open and two of the masked kidnappers stride in. When they reach her, they stand silently, trying to unnerve her. 
LEAD KIDNAPPER Where's your husband? 
JESSICA What?     I don't- The masked leader SLAPS HER SHARPLY across the face! Jessica wants to collapse to the ground, but remains sitting TO KEEP THE PHONE HIDDEN behind her. The Leader bends down and yells right in her face. 
LEAD KIDNAPPER Where is he!? 
JESSICA At work!     Why, what do you want--? SLAP!!!   This one's even nastier than the first. 
LEAD KIDNAPPER 
NEGATIVE!    WHERE WOULD HE RUN?! 
MATCH CUT TO: 
30    RYAN - IN THE POLICE STATION STAIRWELL                               30 Phone to his ear. Wide-eyed. Hearing it all.         For the first time, starting to believe Jessica's story. 
RYAN Oh shit... Panicking, Ryan turns and walks, then jogs, then all-out runs for the station stairwell. 
CUT BACK TO: 
31   INT. KIDNAPPERS' ATTIC                                               31 -v The Lead Kidnapper stands ominously over the trembling Jessica -- Oh God! Does he see the phone cord? 
JESSICA Please, he should be at work! That's all I know. The Leader nods, then turns away. Jessica exhales with relief that he didn't spot the phone. But her victory is short-lived as: 
LEAD KIDNAPPER You have a little boy, right? Ricky? The Wyman School in Westwood? Jessica gasps like a sledgehammer just hit her in the chest. 
JESSICA 
NO! NO--.'.' STAY AWAY FROM MY SON! 
LEAVE HIM ALONE!! But -- the men silently head out the door -- SLAM!       The door locks. Jessica scrambles back to the phone. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) Johnny!! 
32    INTERCUT CALL - RYAN RUNNING UP STAIRWELL/JESSICA IN ATTIC           32 
RYAN I know.    I'm trying to get help. 
JESSICA My son -- Suddenly, as Ryan reaches the first landing -- STATIC starts breaking up the call. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) (worried) Oh my God! What's happening?! 
RYAN Like you don't remember the lunch box? Or anything else about your kid-- (stops, realizing) Oh, man. This is a prank, isn't it? 
JESSICA (VO) No! 
RYAN Bullshit! Oh, you're good lady. Your friends too. Getting me to scream out 'Ricky Martin' at a boys school. Damn, you really nailed me. 
JESSICA (VO) No-- 
This is great, the police think I'm a whack job. The school thinks I'm some kind of perv child molester. I'll probably get the Herpes from the gym teacher's whistle -- 
JESSICA (VO) No, Johnny, you have to listen to me-- /.' But Ryan's had enough.     He turns to leave -- 
RYAN I'm done being your entertainment for the day. I'm going back to the pier while I still have a chance -- -- and passes right by a blonde-haired, green-eyed, EIGHT- YEAR-OLD BOY carrying a Lord of the Rings lunchbox. Ryan hesitates and is about to stop the kid...but then decides "screw it", and keeps on hoofing. Ryan rounds a corner to leave -- and is confronted by the Gym Teacher and a RENT-A-COP SECURITY GUARD. 
GYM TEACHER Here he is! He's the one that's been stalking the students. 
RYAN Stalking?!     No, I can explain-- The Rent-a-Cop mumbles into his walkie. 
RENT-A-COP #1 Okay, we got him. We're at the front of the school. (then, to Ryan) Sir, come with us. 
RYAN (as they grab him) Hey, HEY RENT-A-DUDE--!!    Hang on a sec! This is a huuuge misunderstanding-- A little RENT-A-COP CAR (think geeky, wanna-be cop car) pulls up in the driveway below. The Security Guard starts forcibly leading Ryan toward it, but as he gets close-- 
JESSICA (VO) (interrupting) Lord of the Rings! I forgot his father bought him a Lord of the Rings lunchbox last week! Ryan's heart stops in his chest. He turns to see the Boy with the Lord or the Rings lunchbox racing down the school steps and up to one of the waiting Escalades. 
RYAN (struggling) 
RICKY MARTIN!! The Boy opens the car door...but turns as he hears his name called. For the briefest moment, Ricky and Ryan lock eyes-- 
[CONTINUED) 
--and that's when a HAND reaches out, snags his backpack and YANKS Ricky into the dark of the car! Instantly, the door slams shut and the Escalade begins to take off. WHIP PAN to Ryan's shocked reaction. He's the only one who's seen it. He tries to struggle free of the Guard. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Oh shit!    You just see that?! Losing control of Ryan, the Rent-a-Cop calls to his partner in the car. 
RENT-A-COP #1 Roy, some help over here! Below, the Escalade is leaving the driveway. 
RYAN (struggling harder) Goddamn it, that little kid was just kidnapped!! Do something!! 
RENT-A-COP #1 Roy--! ! The second Rent-a-Cop, hops out of his car and runs over, but as he gets near -- Ryan breaks free! 
RENT-A-COPS 
HEY--! ! They chase after him, but Ryan hops over the hood of the idling RENT-A-COP CAR and throws himself into its driver's seat. Rent-a-Cop #1 reaches through the open window and grabs Ryan's collar -- and is dragged twenty feet as Ryan throws the little car in gear and burns away. 
39       INT. RENT-A-COP CAR - RACING DOWN A RESIDENTIAL STREET           39 Trying to catch the Escalade, a quarter-mile ahead. Ryan feels completely conspicuous in the security car as he slaloms through the streets of East Hollywood. 
JESSICA (VO) What's happening, Ryan?! 
RYAN Don't worry, I can fix this. 
JESSICA (VO) Oh my God. There are three cars between Ryan and the Escalade. 
RYAN It's okay, I can see them ahead. 
JESSICA (VO) Don't lose them! If you follow them back here, you can tell the police where they're holding us! 
RYAN Okay.

40    INT. THE KIDNAPPERS' ESCALADE                                       40 The mountainous Deason drives as Ellis sits shotgun. In the back sits Jessica's son, RICKY; who eyes the two men suspiciously. CCR plays on the RADIO. Ellis, turns down the radio.       Faking sincerity, he turns to face Ricky. 
ELLIS (gesturing to the radio) Do you want me to change the station to something else? Ricky refuses to answer.        Ellis turns around, his fake smile quickly vanishing. 
ELLIS (CONT'D) Yeah.   I like Creedence too. He's about to turn the radio volume up when -- 
JESSICA (VO) What?!    Yo u lost-- 
RYAN No, No!    just give me a second-- As Jessica goes off, Ryan tosses the phone down and focuses on finding the Escalade. He floors the rent-a-cop car, engine CLATTERING, to the intersection. Ryan franticly searches in every direction, but the Escalade is nowhere to be seen. He floors it. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Jesus!    Where the hell did they go? Dreading talking to Jessica, Ryan slowly picks up the receiver. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Jessica, I-- 
JESSICA (VO) You let them get away. Ryan wants to snap at her, but guilt crushes it right out of him. He knows she's right. 
DISSOLVE TO: j    INT. 15TH PRECINCT - LOCKER ROOM - DAY                           45 Mooney changes out of his blues, his ears glued to THREE COPS in the corner, boasting about an arrest. 
COP ONE -- so of course everyone's playing dumb to what kind of drugs he's on. The cops start to snicker; they've all heard that one before. 
COP ONE (CONT'D) So I start searching the place. I'm about to open a closet door when a kid with a Mac 10 jumps out of the bathroom. He shoots. Misses me and hits one of the E.M.T's. Fires again, but the gun jams and BAM! Blows half his face off. Had enough black tar heroin in the closet to resurface the 405. Mooney tries to join in on the conversation. 
MOONEY It must've been around '84, when... The Cops turn around, while grabbing their stuff. 
COP TWO Sorry Moon, we're late for a briefing. Mooney waves them on, but looks disappointed for not being able to join in. 
DEEP MALE VOICE (O.S.) I'll bet in your day you had some stories. Mooney whips his head around to see DETECTIVE JACK TOMLIN. 
MOONEY Hey Tomlin. 
DETECTIVE TOMLIN Taking off? 
MOONEY (hardly thrilled) My anniversary. You know, duty calls; pricey dinner and then some crap-ass play. (beat) Hey, I sent some college kid down to see you this morning. Had some rap about a kidnapping -- 
DETECTIVE TOMLIN I haven't seen anyone, but I'll ask around. Kidnapping, huh? 
MOONEY I thought it was a prank at first, but the kid was so worked up-- 
DETECTIVE TOMLIN Well, don't you get worked up. (slaps Mooney's chest) If the kid comes back, page me, and I'll be sure to see him. 
MOONEY (swallowing his pride) Yeah. Okay, Jack. Thanks. And as Tomlin walks off --

RYAN Are you high?! I just jacked a car! 
JESSICA (VO) Goddamn it, stop thinking about just yourself! You can explain everything to them later! 
SUDDENLY -- SFX: RYAN'S PHONE BEGINS BEEPING. 
RYAN What now? Ryan pulls the phone away from his ear and checks it out. 
INSERT SHOT - CELLPHONE FACE PLATE The BATTERY INDICATOR is flashing:         LOW BATT.   LOW BATT.

JESSICA Don't you have a charger? 
RYAN It's in my car!      Hold on. SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!    The battery indicator has lost another bar. Ryan fumbles around in the armrest. Finds nothing. Opens the glovebox and -- a snub-nosed .38 SPECIAL tumbles out. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Jesus -- ! 
JESSICA What's going on? Did you find one? 
RYAN (staring at the gun) Not exactly... SFX:   BEEP-BEEP!!     Jessica starts growing afraid.

JESSICA You won't get away with this. When I didn't show up at the hospital, someone must have called the police--

It's subtle at first, but grows increasingly louder. She closes her eyes, praying Greer won't hear it-- But Greer does hear it. On the verge of leaving the room, Greer stops. Cocks an ear. Instantly, Jessica tries to cover it with her own voice. 
JESSICA Do you honestly expect me to believe we're going to walk away from this alive? But Greer isn't listening to her. He strides back into the room, listening to the noise under her voice.

MOONEY Ms. Martin? 
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN Yes? 
MOONEY Jessica Kate Martin? The Woman nods. Mooney is plainly disillusioned by the woman. Maybe his hunch was wrong... 
ATTRACTIVE WOMAN Cam I help you, Officer...? She scans Mooney's badge. 
MOONEY Mooney. (shakes his head) No. No, I guess not. Must've been a prank. I m sorry to have b9thered you, Ms. Martin. Have a nice day. The Woman smiles and nods, and Mooney walks off. When he gets to his car, he CRUMPLES the paper with Jessica's name and address, and shakes his head, chuckling at himself. As Mooney drives off-- 
THE ATTRACTIVE WOMAN walks back into the house and flips open her CELLPHONE. When she finishes dialing, a familiar DEEP MALE VOICE answers.

RYAN Jessica? 
JESSICA (VO) Ryan?!    I'm here! Her voice says she can't believe her ears. Relieved, Ryan jumps in the Cadillac XLR and tosses his phone on the passenger seat, next to a LAPTOP computer. Guns the engine and STOMPS the gas. As he passes the ruins of his rent-a-cop car, he slows just enough to open the Cadillac's door and snatch up his bag of Verizon goodies laying on the pavement -- then peels away.

JESSICA (VO) What? 
RYAN Your car's here. Ryan pulls along side the red curb and watches as four tough- looking men exit the vehicle. We recognize them as Greer, Deason, Ellis and Hodges. 
JESSICA (VO) Hurry, Ryan! Just find Craig! Ryan hops out -- but stops when the car CALLS OUT TO HIM.

As he does, NOTICE -- ECU of Ryan slyly slipping the rent-a-cop's tiny .38 Special into Greer's heavy motorcycle jacket. Greer turns, glaring -- But no one's there. Greer looks around, and there's a heart-stopping moment that we're afraid he's going to notice Ryan, who now stands innocently the next line over-- --but Greer's eyes pass right over him as he scans the crowd. Ryan breathes a sigh of relief as Greer finally turns away to walk through the metal detector and...

CRAIG (CONT'D) Oh, God, Jess... What have they done to you? But Jessica won't let this moment be about pity. 
JESSICA Who are they, Craig? Craig doesn't know what to say. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) Tell them, Craig. Tell them they have the wrong family. Tell them they've made a mistake-- But something in his eyes disagrees. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) What?!      What is it?

GREEK Where is the disc now? Blood trickles from the corner of Craig's mouth. 
CRAIG You have to promise. If I give it to you... you'll let my family go. 
GREER I'll tell you what, you tell me where it is-- (turns his gun on Jessica) --and I won't blow her brains all over you right now. Greer traces the barrel of the gun down Jessica's cheek. Craig looks utterly helpless. 
GREEK (CONT'D) Your call Craig. It's an eighty-five ''cent bullet to me. 
Greer lowers the gun to her neckline( pulls her shirt lower... She pleads "no" at Craig with her eyes, but he finally breaks.

CRAIG I love you. Craig squeezes the good years of their marriage into a strong, loving embrace. Jessica hugs him closer. Leans into his ear to seemingly whisper her love in return -- but what she actually whispers takes Craig by surprise. 
JESSICA (quickly; sotto voce) Pretend I'm telling you that I love you. There's an open phone line in here. You'll have help at the office, but if you give these men what they want, we're dead. Jessica kisses her husband on the lips and withdraws, leaving Craig with an utterly confused expression on his face. But before his look can betray him--

RYAN Me? 
MAIL CLERK You waiting for a package? Now everyone's looking at Ryan.     Including Greer. 
RYAN (facing away) Sure, uh... I'm supposed to pick something up for Mr. Fountain over at the Bonaventure.

MAILROOM SUPERVISOR Mr. Martin? I found a number of things that could be what you're looking for. Mind coming back to take a look? Hodges shoots Craig a look, "go".

MAIL CLERK (impatiently) Sir? You think you could just go outside and get your clipboard? Just then, Hodges and Craig come marching out of the vault.

DEASON 
YOU AND YOUR KID ARE DEAD! She lowers her arm, defeated, out of breath...        You win. 
JESSICA Don't hurt me, and I'll do anything... Anything.. . There is a promise in what Jessica offers that Deason responds to. His fist FLASHES toward her throat, making her flinch. But rather than hitting her, he wraps his meaty fingers around her throat, almost daring her to stop him. Jessica trembles, but that is all, and just as Deason begins to enjoy his work, Jessica JABS at his face, but he predicted as much and easily moves to deflect it -- SNICKK! -- she flicks her wrist up and SLICES the underside of his upper arm. Deason flinches a little bit, like a bee sting, then laughs as he notices the tiny SHARD in her hand-- 
DEASON (sarcastic) Oooh. --but that's when he HEARS it. A DRIPPING SOUND. Deason looks down at his arm and is confused to see his entire shirt sleeve SOAKED IN BLOOD. It literally pours from his arm onto the floor like a river. Deason drains white; dizzy.      He looks at Jessica, confused. 
JESSICA Brachial artery. Pumps up to 30 liters of blood per minute...and there's only five liters in the human body. Three seconds later, Deason crumbles...and Jessica leaves the attic.

TELEMARKETER Look, sir, we can take your name off our list if you want, but you don't have to get nasty-- 
RYAN (VO) What--?    Who is this? 
TELEMARKETER Mark.     At Mastercharge Credit Union- 
RYAN (VO) *59             A frickin' telemarketer? But I                            159 just hit "Last Incoming Call"-- Ryan suddenly puts it together. 
RYAN (VO) (CONT'D) You bastard. The Telemarketer quickly hangs up before it gets ugly.

TOMLIN (VO) Look, Captain, we've got to do everything we can to protect this guy. I mean, shit, with all his years in he's owed a little.

TOMLIN STANDING NEXT TO MOONEY OUTSIDE JESSICA'S HOUSE 
GREER VO He's with you? How'd he find out? 
TOMLIN Said something about a kid who came into the station earlier-- Greer grimaces, putting it together. 
GREER Early twenties? Stumbled out of Brian Wilson's hamper? 
TOMLIN Yeah.   Something like that. 
GREER Tomlin. Take care of him.      No witnesses. That's more than Tomlin bargained for. 
TOMLIN Are you sure that's necessary, sir? 
GREER You know once the shitstorm starts, there's nothing I can do to save you. 
TOMLIN Sure. That's what I thought.        I'll tell him. 
Tomlin hangs up with a calm FLICK.   The Paramedic finishes up Mooney's bandage. 
PARAMEDIC #1 Keep pressure on it until you get it stitched. 
MOONEY What's the word? 
TOMLIN Not g9od. I.A.'s not throwing out any lifelines with all that's going on.. . (re: Mooney's sh9ulder) Come on. You can write a statement while I take you to the hospital.

HODGES Well?   What'd he say? 
GREER You know a desk jockey named Mooney? 
HODGES 
-- HOLY SHIT! Greer sees Hodges gaping up the stairwell. Following his look, Greer turns...and sees the attic door WIDE OPEN! Further in, he can make out Deason's bloody body and the rigged-together phone... In fact, the only thing Greer doesn't see is Jessica. 
GREER 
NO! Greer turns and pounds down the stairs. 
GREER (VO) No.     Somewhere quieter. 
RYAN Dude, you're lucky I'm still talkin' to your sorry ass. You do as I say, exactly as I say, or I hang up now and slap this bitch on Nightline, you know what I'm sayin'? There's a long beat. 
GREER (VO) Fine.    But you come alone. 
RYAN Done. 
GREER (VO) How will I recognize you? 
RYAN You let me worry about that. What's your cell number? 
GREER (VO) (310) 555-8342. An hour then? 
RYAN I can hardly wait. Ryan hangs up.    A scared, but satisfied smile...

MOONEY (to Tomlin) Shouldn't we be on Pico? To the right, some PEOPLE wait for a bus.      Tomlin turns left. 
TOMLIN County will have a six hour wait. Ten if they know you're a cop. Mooney grunts his gratitude as Tomlin heads toward a wasteland of warehouses. And just as any potential witnesses vanish from sight -- Tomlin's cellphone RINGS!      He lowers the gun and answers the call. 
TOMLIN (CONT'D) Yeah? 
GREER (OS) Is it taken care of? 
TOMLIN Not yet. 
GREER (OS) Good. We're making a trade with the kid at the Santa Monica Pier. Your boy can ID the kid for us. Bring him down. 
TOMLIN (relieved) I'm on it. Tomlin flips his phone closed and turns the car around. 
TOMLIN (CONT'D) We caught a break with the kid. He's been spotted on the pier. Think you can hang on a little longer? Just enough to ID the kid before we patch you up? Mooney clearly doesn't want to say "no."     But it hurts. 
TOMLIN (CONT'D) Whaddaya say? Up to you. Beat. 
MOONEY Let's solve the goddamn thing.

RYAN And I'll forget a lot, too. But not until they're both out of danger. Now PAN AROUND TO REVEAL Ryan among the crowd, wearing a SURFING WINDBREAKER; HOODED with WATERPROOF POCKETS -- but where's his cellphone? Moving closer, we see Ryan's wearing the EARBUD MIKE from the Verizon store. With the earbud concealed under the loose hood, Ryan looks like anyone else just watching the show. 
RYAN (CONT'D) Your choice, man. The Martins or the DVD. Either way, I'm not hanging around any longer. You got five seconds, then I disconnect your ass.

GREER Shut up and do it!

GREER (VO) Don't screw me kid, y9u won't live long enough to enjoy it. 
RYAN Oooh, I think I just pissed myself. Ryan looks optimistic when Hodges gets out and opens the back door. And just as he's on the brink of success-- 
FEMALE VOICE (OS) 
HEY--! 
A woman's HAND grabs the hood of Ryan's windbreaker and rips it away from his face. Wheels him around. It's: 
CHLOE There you are! Where the hell were you! ? 
RYAN Chloe!    Get away from here! 
CHLOE Know how many hours I waited for you to bring back those stupid shirts?! What'd you do? Sell them on the Prominade yourself--? But Ryan's got no time for this.

CHLOE (shrugs free) What -- are you high? Suddenly, Mooney steps up beside Ryan and grabs him. 
MOONEY (winded) I've been..looking for..you, kid-- But Ryan struggles, thinking Mooney is with the bad guys. Mooney grabs him as he tries to make a break for it. 
RYAN Let go of me! Sonofabitch, let go!

194   INT. THE DORY ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                     194 TOMLIN - By the time his eyes adjust to the dark, Ryan is nowhere to be seen. TARPS undulate over jumbles of boxes and equipment everywhere -- a hundred places to hide. Alone, Tomlin stalks among the equipment.     Gun out.   Hunting Ryan like a snake on the scent or prey. 
TOMLIN You're wounded kid, just give me what I came for, and I'll let you all go. Police sirens in the distance grow louder. Tomlin's offer goes unanswered.    That's when he notices the BLOOD on the ground. Tomlin smiles, following Ryan's trail to a PILE OF BLOOD-SMEARED TARPS -- where the trail ends! It's obvious Ryan used these to staunch his wound. Shit! He's gonna have to search this whole place-- Then, suddenly, Tomlin gets an idea. He pulls out his phone, making sure it's concealed from view, and writes a TEXT MESSAGE to-- x95   EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT                                     195 Greer pulls out his ringing cell phone. On the text screen it says, "CALL HIM".

Instantly, Tomlin hones in on the noise -- coming from under a bulky tarp along the far wall -- and EMPTIES HIS GUN at it! The tarp shreds. Nothing could survive the assault. Tomlin walks calmly across the room to stand before the tarp. 
TOMLIN Shoulda stayed at home this morning, kid. And just then, Tomlin throws off the shredded tarp exposing-- Ryan's cellphone.   And nothing else. 
^_        RYAN (OS) Funny. I was about to say the same to you. 
TOMLIN What the-- And in the instant Tomlin realizes he's been tricked, he turns and-- 
WHAM! 
RYAN HITS TOMLIN in the face with a 2x4, SMASHING his TEETH and sending him backwards. Before Tomlin has time to rec9ver, Ryan swings again. CRACK! -- And his KNEE CAP is obliterated. Ryan, looking like a psychotic Babe Ruth, gives Tomlin two more vicious WHACKS before grabbing his cellphone and high-tailing it out of there.

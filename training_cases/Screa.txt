SCREAM (SCARY MOVIE) 
by Kevin Williamson 
Rewrite July 31, 1995 
FADE IN 
ON A RINGING TELEPHONE. 
A hand reaches for it, bringing the receiver up to the face of CASEY BECKER, a young girl, no more than sixteen.  A friendly face with innocent eyes. 
CASEY Hello. 
MAN'S VOICE (from phone) Hello. 
Silence. 
CASEY Yes. 
MAN Who is this? 
CASEY Who are you trying to reach? 
MAN What number is this? 
CASEY What number are you trying to reach? 
MAN I don't know. 
CASEY I think you have the wrong number. 
MAN Do I? 
CASEY It happens. Take it easy. 
CLICK! She hangs up the phone.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Casey in a living room, alone.  She moves from the living room to the kitchen.  It's a nice house.  Affluent. 
The phone RINGS again. 
INT.  KITCHEN 
Casey grabs the portable. 
CASEY Hello. 
MAN I'm sorry. I guess I dialed the wrong number. 
CASEY So why did you dial it again? 
MAN To apologize. 
CASEY You're forgiven. Bye now. 
MAN Wait, wait, don't hang up. 
Casey stands in front of a sliding glass door.  It's pitch black outside. 
CASEY What? 
MAN I want to talk to you for a second. 
CASEY They've got 900 numbers for that. Seeya. 
CLICK!  Casey hangs up.  A grin on her face. 
EXT.  CASEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT - ESTABLISHING 
A big country home with a huge sprawling lawn full of big oak trees.  It sits alone with no neighbors in sight. 
The phone RINGS again. 
INT.  KITCHEN 
Popcorn sizzles in a pot on the stove.  Casey covers it with a lid, reaching for the portable phone. 
CASEY Hello. 
MAN Why don't you want to talk to me? 
CASEY Who is this? 
MAN You tell me your name, I'll tell you mine. 
CASEY (shaking the popcorn) I don't think so. 
MAN What's that noise? 
Casey smiles, playing along, innocently. 
CASEY Popcorn. 
MAN You're making popcorn? 
CASEY Dial someone else, okay? 
MAN You getting scared? 
CASEY No-bored. 
CLICK.  She hangs up.  The phone RINGS again.  She grabs it. 
CASEY Listen, asshole... 
MAN (deadly serious) NO, YOU LISTEN, YOU LITTLE BITCH. IF YOU HANG UP ON ME AGAIN I'LL GUT YOU LIKE A FISH. UNDERSTAND? 
Total silence.  He has gotten her full attention. 
CASEY Is this some kind of a joke? 
MAN More of a game, really. 
Casey eyes the glass doors, then looks up the hallway to the front doors...moving to it.  It's unlocked.  She bolts it. 
CASEY I'm two seconds from calling the police. 
MAN They'd never make it in time. 
Casey moves her face flush against the door, her eye looking through the peephole. 
ANGLE THROUGH PEEPHOLE. 
A distorted view of the front porch.  It is empty.  She relaxes a bit, relieved. 
CASEY What do you want? 
MAN (pure evil) TO SEE WHAT YOUR INSIDES LOOK LIKE. 
Casey's jaw drops as total fear storms her face.  She hangs up the phone, throwing it down on a side table when... 
THE DOORBELL CHIMES. 
Casey leaps out of her skin.  She turns to the door as it chimes again. 
CASEY (calling out) Who's there? 
Another CHIME.  She moves to it. 
CASEY (louder) Who's there? 
No answer.  Fuck this.  It's time for the police.  She goes for the portable phone. Just as she picks it up... 
IT RINGS. 
Casey almost drops it, losing her breath... 
She brings it to her ear with trembling hands, saying nothing...listening, waiting... 
A long silence.  And then. 
MAN You should never say "Who's there?". Don't you watch scary movies? It's a death wish. 
Casey clutches the wall, nearly collapsing.  She tries her damndest to hang tough. 
CASEY Look, enough is enough. You had your fun now you better leave me alone or else. 
MAN Or else what? 
CLOSE ON her face, her mind thinking, calculating... 
CASEY My boyfriend will be here any second and he'll be pissed when I tell him... 
MAN I thought you didn't have a boyfriend. 
Busted.  She holds steady. 
CASEY I lied. I do have a boyfriend and he'll be here any second and your ass better be gone. 
MAN Sure... 
CASEY I swear it. And he's big and plays football and will beat the shit out of you. 
MAN I'm getting scared. 
CASEY I'm telling you the truth. I lied before... 
MAN I believe you... 
CASEY So you better leave. 
MAN His name wouldn't be Steve, would it? 
Silence.  Casey buckles at the knees, losing it. 
CASEY How do you know his name? 
MAN Go to the back door and turn on the porch light--again. 
Suddenly...through tears...Godsent... 
CASEY (a whisper) Michael...Michael Myers. 
MAN YES! 
Casey SIGHS...relieved. 
MAN Now for the real question. 
CASEY NOOOO.... 
MAN But you're doing so well. 
CASEY Please go away! Leave us alone! 
MAN Then answer the question. Same category. 
Casey is a blubbering, wet mass on the floor. 
CASEY ..please..no... 
MAN Name the killer in FRIDAY THE 13TH. 
A mad smile purses Casey's lips.  She knows this.  She leaps up, through tears, screaming... 
CASEY Jason! Jason!...JASON! 
A slight PAUSE. 
MAN I'm sorry. That's the wrong answer. 
CASEY No it's not. It was Jason. 
MAN Afraid not. 
CASEY It was Jason. I saw that godamned movie twenty times. It was Jason. 
MAN Then you should know Jason's MOTHER -Mrs.Vorhees was the original killer. Jason didn't show up until the sequel. 
Casey is stupefied. 
CASEY You tricked me... 
MAN Lucky, for you there's a bonus round. But poor Steve...I'm afraid...he's out. 
This implication sends Casey running to the kitchen...to the glass doors.  She flips on the porch lights to see... 
STEVE 
eyes wide, sitting in the lawn chair...his belly gaping open...a mass of blood and ripped flesh...his insides lay on the ground between his feet...steam rising. 
A SCREAM erupts from the bottom of her soul as Casey collapse on the floor...nearly passing out.  CLOSE ON her face...pale and ghostly white.  She SOBS. 
MAN Final question. Are you ready? 
She doesn't answer.  A long, maddening silence.  Casey reaches up and CLICKS off the light, making Steve go away...wishing, hoping... 
CASEY ..leave me alone..please... 
MAN Answer the question and I will. 
Casey is curled up on the floor like an infant, rocking slowly back and forth. 
MAN What door am I at? 
CASEY What? 
MAN There are two doors to your house. A front door and a back one. If you answer correctly-you live. 
From where Casey sits she can see both front and back doors.  She deliberates...with her last bit of strength she tries to strategize.  Eyeing both, the front door...the back door trying to decide between the two. 
CASEY Don't make me...I can't...I won't. 
MAN Your call. 
In the darkness, Casey crawls to the kitchen counter-she leans up and grabs a long, sharp knife. 
Casey looks around her...she looks down the hall to the front door...then turns back to the kitchen glass door as it suddenly... 
SHATTERS TO BITS... 
as a lawn chair come flying through it.  Exploding glass sprays everywhere. 
This incites Casey like fire.  She springs to her feet...bolting out of the kitchen as a SHADOW moves quickly through the shattered doorframe. 
ANGLE ON CASEY 
Somewhere in the house, back flat against a window, listening to FEET ON CRACKING GLASS.  She turns and unlocks the latch, quietly sliding it up. She can hear him move through the foyer...to the front door. 
Casey lifts herself up and puts her legs through the window.  She holds the knife in one hand, the phone in the other. 
Casey eases out the window, fumbling, dropping the knife back in the house.  She starts to reach for it.  Fuck it, she takes off... 
EXT.  SIDEWALK 
Sidney approaches the school seeing the commotion.  Four different REPORTERS stand in front of four different cameras giving four different news reports. 
She moves passed a policeman standing guard.  Her interest peaked, she stops at the first reporter who is... 
GALE WEATHERS 
Thirties.  He smart face is overshadowed by a flashy smile and a massive mane of chemically enhanced hair. 
GALE (for the camera) The small town of Bayboro, North Carolina was devastated last night when two young teenagers were found brutally butchered. Authorities have yet to issue a statement but our sources tell us that no arrest has been made and the murderer could strike again... 
ON SIDNEY.  Moved, disturbed.  From behind, a finger taps her shoulder.  She spins around to see... 
Tatum Riley, same age, feisty, carefree. 
TATUM Do you believe this shit? 
SIDNEY What happened? 
They break away from the crowd and head for school. 
TATUM Oh God! You don't know? Casey Becker and Steve Forrest were killed last night. 
SIDNEY No way. 
TATUM And not just killed, Sid. We're talking splatter movie killed-split open end to end. 
SIDNEY Casey Becker? She sits next to me in English. 
TATUM Not anymore. Her parents found her hanging from a tree. Her insides on the outside. 
SIDNEY Do they know who did it? 
TATUM Fucking clueless-they're interrogating the entire school. Teachers, students, staff, janitors... 
SIDNEY They think it's school-related? 
TATUM They don't know. Dewey said this is the worst crime they've ever seen. Even worse than... (stopping herself) Well it's bad. They're bringing in the feds. This is big. 
Sidney looks back at Gale, her face deeply pained. 
INT.  CLASSROOM - LATER 
A frumpy old woman, MRS. TATE, faces her class.  Her hands clasped together.  A tragic look upon her face. 
MRS. TATE ..a terrible tragedy. An unbearable loss. It's days like today we need prayer in school... 
Sidney sits near the rear of the room.  The desk in front of her sits vacant.  Sidney can't take her eyes of it. 
The door opens and a student opens with a slip of paper.  He hand s it to Mrs. Tate. 
MRS. TATE Sidney. It appears to be your turn. 
INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE 
The room is at capacity...wall to wall with police, and the likes. Some sit, stand, lean... 
SHERIFF BURKE, a round man in his fifties, wipes the stress from his face. 
SHERIFF BURKE Who's up next? 
A young officer looks at the clipboard.  This is DEPUTY RILEY, better known as DEWEY.  He's a big guy, 20's, handsome in a scrubbed-clean boyish way. 
DEWEY Sidney Prescott. 
Sheriff Burke gestures to bring her in.  PRINCIPAL HIMBRY, 50's, an old codger of a man wearing a sour face speaks up. 
MR. HIMBRY Sidney Prescott. She was daughter of... 
DEWEY We all know Sidney, Mr. Himbry. 
SHERIFF BURKE How she doin'? 
MR. HIMBRY She's adjusted well. Maintains an "A" average. You never know she... 
Himbry stops short, seeing Sidney in the doorway.  He rises and seats her. 
SHERIFF BURKE Hi Sidney. 
SIDNEY Sheriff Burke. Dewey. 
Dewey shakes his head seriously. 
DEWEY It's Deputy Riley today, Sid. 
SHERIFF BURKE How is everything? 
SIDNEY Good. 
SHERIFF BURKE And your Dad? How's he doing? 
SIDNEY We're fine. Thanks. 
She moves to the front door, unlocks it...pulls it open...it catches on the chain.  Shit!  She pushes it closed again looking behind her..the FIGURE has risen, knife in hand. Sidney pulls on the chain and then-inexplicably turns and... 
RUNS UP THE STAIRS.  The FIGURE right behind her. 
INT.  UPSTAIRS LANDING 
The FIGURE leaps at Sidney taking hold of her foot, she grabs madly at the wall...her hands grasp a framed painting-a quiet country home, subdued colors, done in oils-she rips it from the wall swinging it behind her... 
It catches the FIGURE head on, smashing against his skull, sending him backwards, tumbling down the stairs.  Sidney races to her bedroom... 
INT.  BEDROOM 
She locks the door shut, the pulls her closet door open, placing the edge right at the door knob just as... 
THE FIGURE POUNDS AGAINST THE BEDROOM DOOR... 
ramming it, it rips open, but the closet door catches it in a crazy vice-like hold. 
Sidney grabs the desk phone.  It's dead...off the hook downstairs. 
The figure rushes the door several times..the frame splinters..but won't give. 
Sidney is at her computer, she punches at the keypad madly. 
CLOSE ON SCREEN AS WORDS APPEAR. 
FAX MODEM 
9-1-1 SEND 
The knife slashes through the crack in the door wildly. 
ON SCREEN AGAIN 
HELP KILLER 
34 ELM ST 
Sidney presses SEND when it occurs to her-all is quiet.  The FIGURE is gone.  A fearful silence.  She looks around...the only sound her own rapid, terrified BREATHING. 
ON THE SCREEN 
"Stay calm.  Police enroute." 
Suddenly a NOISE at the window...Sidney looks up to see... 
BILLY 
her boyfriend, staring at her, surprised. 
SIDNEY Oh Billy...Please...God... 
BILLY I heard screaming. The door was locked. Are you okay... 
SIDNEY He's here. He's trying to kill me... 
Billy pulls himself through the window.  As he does, a small black object falls from his dark jeans.  It hits the floor as Sidney eyes it...a sleek, compact cellular phone. 
Sidney stops in her tracks.  Their eyes meet...an eternity.  A SIREN is heard in the distance.  Sidney bolts... 
BILLY Hey...wait...what's goin.. 
Billy reaches for her.  Sidney unblocks the bedroom door and tears out of the room. 
INT.  LANDING 
Sidney nearly falls down the stairs... 
INT.  FOYER 
She rips the chain off the door, pulls it open, coming face to face with a white, ghostly mask. A massive SCREAM erupts from her gut as... 
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK 
to find Dewey-Deputy Riley, holding it.  Red lights flash, sirens BLAST vas car after car surrounds the house. 
Sidney falls into the safety of Dewey's arms. 
EXT.  FRONT YARD - MINUTES LATER 
The yard is a whirlwind of activity.  An ambulance, squad cars, cops everywhere... 
CLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE 
as it SMASHES against the hood of a police car.  His hands are being cuffed, his rights being read. 
BILLY (screaming) I didn't do anything! Sid...where's Sid? Ask her, she'll tell ya... 
Dewey holds a car door open as Sheriff Burke steps out. 
DEWEY We got him, Sheriff. Billy Loomis. 
SHERIFF BURKE Hank Loomis' kid? Aw..Jesus... 
Gale moves back to the van leaving Kenny miffed. 
INT.  POLICE STATION 
A small town station.  The bull pen is a little square room with four desks and tonight--it's hopping.  Cops everywhere. 
INT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE 
Sidney sits at a desk drinking a cup of water.  She wears the Sheriff's jacket over her shoulders.  Dewey approaches. 
SIDNEY Did you reach my Dad? 
DEWEY You're sure it was the Hilton? 
SIDNEY At the airport. 
DEWEY He's not registered. Could he have gone to another hotel? 
SIDNEY I don't know. I guess. 
DEWEY We'll find him, Sid. Don't worry. 
Sidney stares blankly, numb. 
INT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE 
Billy sits opposite Sheriff Burke.  Next to Billy, sits his father, HANK LOOMIS, an older version of Billy. 
SHERIFF BURKE What are you doing with a cellular telephone, son? 
MR. LOOMIS It's my phone. He was just playing around with it. 
SHERIFF BURKE You got some ideas of playing around, boy. 
BILLY I didn't call anyone with it. I just took it for fun. 
MR. LOOMIS Everybody's got one now. Why don't you check the phone bill for chrissakes. Call my carrier--AirFone Comp. They'll have records of every number dialed. 
SHERIFF BURKE Thank you, Hank. We're on it. What were you doing out at Sidney's tonight? 
BILLY I just wanted to see her, that's all. 
SHERIFF BURKE You rode your bike out there? 
BILLY Yes, sir. 
SHERIFF BURKE And last night? Sidney said you crawled through her window last night too? 
MR. LOOMIS (surprised) You were out last night? 
BILLY I watched TV for awhile but the I felt like going for a bike ride. 
SHERIFF BURKE Did you ride past Casey Becker's house? 
BILLY No, I didn't. I didn't kill anyone, Sheriff. 
SHERIFF BURKE We're gonna have to keep you, Billy. The governor's got SBI, FBI, and god knows who else on their way down here. 
Billy fights tears. 
BILLY This is crazy. I didn't do it. 
Sheriff Burke eyes him up and down, very carefully. 
INT.  POLICE BULL PEN - MINUTES LATER 
Tatum has joined Sidney.  The sheriff's door opens and Billy is led out by a coupla UNIFORMS.  Burke and Dewey appear in the door watching Tatum comfort Sidney. 
OUT OF EAR SHOT 
DEWEY That ghost mask is sold at both Kroger's and WalMart. Neither of which keep purchase records. 
SHERIFF BURKE What about the cellular phone bill? 
DEWEY They're pulling Loomis' account. But it'll be morning before we see something. You think he did it? 
SHERIFF BURKE Twenty years ago I woulda said not a chance. But these kids today...damn if I know. 
TATUM (o.s.) Hey...Dewey. Can we go now? 
DEWEY Hold up a sec... 
SHERIFF BURKE She staying with you? 
DEWEY We haven't located her Dad yet. 
TATUM (o.s.) Goddammit, Dewey! 
Dewey turns to her, his face red. 
DEWEY What did Mama tell you? When I wear this badge you treat me like a man of the law. 
TATUM I'm sorry, Deputy Dewey-boy but we're ready to go. 
TATUM Take a message. 
SIDNEY It's alright. I'll get it. 
Sidney takes off out the door.  Mama Riley motions to Tatum. 
MAMA RILEY (whispers) How is she? 
Tatum shrugs. 
INT.  HALLWAY 
Sidney grabs the phone at the end of the hall. 
SIDNEY Hello? 
MAN (from phone) Hello Sidney. 
IT'S HIM.  The CAMERA does a Hitchcock as Sidney's entire body goes weak..his VOICE moving through her..invading her.  She CRIES OUT. 
SIDNEY NOOOOOO... 
Mama Riley turns in the doorway.  Tatum comes bolting out of the bedroom. 
MAN (from phone) Poor Billy-boyfriend. An innocent guy doesn't stand a chance with you. 
SIDNEY LEAVEMEALONE! 
MAN Looks like you fingered the wrong guy...again. 
SIDNEY Who are you? 
TATUM Hang up, Sid. 
MAN Don't worry. You'll find out soon enough. I promise. 
Mama Riley BEATS on a closed bedroom door. 
MAMA RILEY Dewey! Dewey! 
MAN This is gonna be fun, Sidney. Just like old times. 
CLICK. 
Dewey flies out of his room wearing only his boxers...holding his gun. 
DEWEY What? What? 
The phone goes dead.  Sidney stands frozen. 
EXT.  BAYBORO MAIN STREET - DAWN - ESTABLISHING 
The morning sun shines high over Bayboro Townsquare.  Cars come to life, townsfolk stir as the picture postcard community awakens from a restless sleep. 
INT.  KITCHEN - MORNING 
Sidney and Tatum sit at the kitchen table, dressed and ready for school as Mama Riley serves up breakfast.  A small television sits on the counter BLARING. 
Dewey, in uniform, stands near the door, talking on the phone. 
MAMA RILEY I think you girls really should stay home today. 
TATUM Your objection is duly noted. 
SIDNEY I'd rather be around a lot of people, Mama Riley. 
From the TV, Sidney hears her name, "SIDNEY PRESCOTT..."  All eyes go to the television. 
REPORTER (on TV) ..who escaped a vicious attack last night was the daughter of Maureen Prescott who was brutally killed last year when convicted murderer Cotton Weary... 
INSERT of COTTON WEARY, in prison fatigues.  A once handsome man, now haggard and worn. 
REPORTER (cont'd) ..broke into their home and savagely raped and tortured the deceased. Cotton Weary is currently awaiting appeal for the death sentence handed down after the young Sidney testified against him. She was the key witness in the state's prosecution... 
SIDNEY It's never gonna stop. Is it? 
Dewey is off the phone. 
DEWEY Billy was released. His cellular bill was clean. He didn't make those calls. 
SIDNEY Somebody called me, Dewey. I'm not making it up. 
DEWEY I know. We're checking every cellular account in the county. Any calls made to you or Casey Becker are being cross- referenced. It's gonna take time but we'll find him. 
SIDNEY And my Dad? Any word on him? 
Riley shakes his head "no". 
EXT.  SCHOOL STREET - LATER 
Once again, REPORTERS line the street attacking students as they make their way to school, asking questions, hungry for that teenage insight. 
Dewey's patrol jeep cruises by.  Sidney watches from the passenger's window. 
GIRL #2 Why would she lie about it? 
GIRL #1 For attention. The girl has some serious issues. 
Sidney listens intently. 
A toilet FLUSHES.  Sidney quickly jumps in a stall, hiding, just as GIRL #1 appears from a stall.  She looks like that voice--a snotty little twit. 
GIRL #1 What if she did it? What if Sidney killed Casey and Steve? 
GIRL #2 And why would she do that? 
GIRL #1 Maybe she was hot for Steve and killed them both in a jealous rage. 
Another toilet FLUSHES. 
GIRL #2 Why would Sidney want to be with Steve? She has her own bubble-butt boyfriend Billy. 
GIRL #1 Maybe she's a slut just like her mom. 
INSIDE THE STALL Sidney listens.  Her face weakening. 
GIRL #2 You're evil. 
GIRL #1 Please, it's common knowledge. Her mother was a trollop. 
GIRL #2 appears from her stall--another twit.  They both stand in front of the mirror adjusting two snotty faces. 
GIRL #2 Cut some slack. She watched her mom get butchered. 
GIRL #1 And it fucked her up royally. Think about it. It makes perfect sense. Her mom's death leaves her distraught and hostile at a cruel and inhumane world, she's disillusioned, where's God, etc. Completely suicidal. And one day she snaps. She wants to kill herself but realizes teen suicide is out this year. And homicide is a much healthier therapeutic expression. 
From the stall, Sidney listens, her heart pounding, jaw quivering. 
GIRL #2 Where do you get this shit? 
GIRL #1 Ricki Lake. 
The two girls exit.  Sidney moves out of the stall, catching her reflection in the mirror. 
SIDNEY Pathetic. 
Water DRIPS somewhere from a leaky pipe as wind WHISTLES in from the cracked transom above the bathroom door.  It sound almost like a whisper,   "Siddneey..." 
Sidney spins around.  What the...  She checks out the bathroom. The doors to the stalls are all closed.  She bends down and scans beneath them, looking for feet.  No one.  Nothing. 
Sidney turns back to the mirror.  Suddenly... 
MAN (o.c. whisper) Siddneey... 
Unmistakable this time.  The VOICE strikes Sidney like a nail through the eye.  It comes from one of the stalls.  She stands thunderstruck, eyeing the stalls thru the mirror. 
SIDNEY Is someone there? 
A long, morose silence.  And then: 
MAN (softly, simply) It's me, Sidney. 
Sidney spins around.  Fuck no!  HE'S HERE.  Terror floods her face.  She eyes the exit door, then the row of stalls she must pass to get to it. 
She checks under the stalls again.  Nothing...where the fuck is he?  She takes a step forward when... 
TWO FEET step down from a toilet onto the floor in the last stall. Sidney's face draws tight as the stall door begins to CREAK open. She bolts forward, making a break for it...but slips on the wet floor...her feet flying out from under... 
Sidney reaches out...grabs hold of a sink...saves herself from falling...she glimpses a GHOST MASK in the mirror coming for her. A hand grabs her shoulder as she SLAMS her body through the exit door...narrowly escaping. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
Sidney flies out of the bathroom door SCREAMING...burning up the hallway, not looking back.  A TEACHER, hearing her SCREAM, peer out from an open doorway...as Sidney sprints by him, not stopping...running madly. 
INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
CLOSE on a red-faced Principal Himbry as he reads someone the riot act. 
MR. HIMBRY I'm sickened. Your whole havoc-inducing, thieving, whoring generation disgusts me. 
The CAMERA SWINGS AROUND to reveal two GHOST MASKED STUDENTS standing at attention.  Mr. Himbry rips the mask off of one of the student's heads. 
MR. HIMBRY Two students have been savagely murdered. And this is how we express our compassion and sensivity? 
He rips the mask off the other student. 
MR. HIMBRY We throw on a mask and dance around campus just hoping someone else gets butchered before we get bored again. You're both expelled. 
The GHOSTS doth protest... 
GHOST #1 Aw, come on, Mr. Himbry, it was just a joke. 
GHOST #2 Yeah, that's not fair. 
A deep rooted hostility has taken over Mr. Himbry's face.  Neither student budges, scared to even breathe. 
MR. HIMBRY No, it's not fair. Fairness would be to rip your insides out and hang you from a tree so you can be exposed for the desensitized, heartless little shits that you are. 
SIDNEY It was him, Tatum. I know it. 
Tatum wants to believe her but... 
TATUM You are not to be alone again. Is that clear? If you pee--I pee. 
Stu appears. 
STU Is this not cool or what? Hey, Sid, what happened? 
TATUM For once, Stu, drop it. 
STU Okay, but whatever you did--the entire student body thanks you. 
Stu moves to Tatum and gives her a kiss. 
STU And to celebrate this impromptu fall break, I propose we have a party. Tonight, my house. 
SIDNEY Are you serious? 
STU My parents are out of town. It'll be like my hurricane bash last year. Nothing extreme. Just a few of us, hangin'. 
Tatum warms to the idea. 
TATUM This could be good. What do you think, Sid? 
SIDNEY I don't know... 
TATUM Come on. Pathos has it's perks. 
Sidney considers trying hard to be good spirited. 
STU Remember, there's safety in numbers. 
SIDNEY (giving in) Yeah, okay...whatever. 
STU Cool. See you guys tonight. Bring food. 
Stu speeds off, sliding down the empty hallway. 
INT.  PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - LATER 
Mr. Himbry sits at his desk staring at the ghosts masks before him.  He picks one of them up, snickering. 
MR. HIMBRY Damn... 
He stands and moves to the closet next to his office door.  He pulls it open to reveal a mirror hooked inside the door.  He tries the mask on, pulling it over his face, looking in the mirror when... 
A KNOCK AT THE DOOR stops him.  He rips the mask off his head, turns to his office door and opens it to reveal... 
AN EMPTY DOORWAY.  He pokes his head into the outer office area and looks around.  But no one's there. 
MR. HIMBRY Yes? Hello? 
The place is empty.  A little suspicious he closes the door, catching his reflection in the closet mirror.  He looks at the mask in his hands.  Jesus, even he's jumpy.  Two seconds later... 
ANOTHER KNOCK AT THE DOOR.  Himbry grabs the door quickly, this time throwing it open.  Again no one's there.  He steps out into the outer office determined to catch a prankster. 
INT.  OUTER OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Completely empty.  Mr. Himbry moves through the outer office and into the school corridor.  The overhead lights have been turned off and the corridor is now dark and deserted.  He looks up and down the hall.  Only a JANITOR is seen in the distance pushing a broom. 
MR. HIMBRY Little shits. 
Mr. Himbry returns to his office. 
INT.  OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Himbry reenters his office, moving to his desk, when he spots the closet door NOW CLOSED SHUT. 
This gives him a pause-he had left it open.  Hadn't he?  Suddenly, he can't remember.  He shifts uneasy, reaching for the door knob, pulling the door open to reveal... 
AN EMPTY CLOSET.  He stands still a moment, suddenly realizing someone could easily now be standing behind the open closet door. Nervously, he pushes it shut to reveal... 
NOTHING.  Himbry shakes away his jitters, realizing he's spooked himself.  He continues to his desk, pushing his office door shut when... 
A GHOST MASKED FIGURE lunges from behind it...knife in hand. Quick and easy.  Three quick jabs to the stomach and Himbry goes down.  The GHOST MASKED FIGURE towering above him. 
EXT.  TATUM'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON - LATER 
The late afternoon sun is quickly disappearing. 
Tatum and Sidney rock on the front porch looking out into the small town neighborhood.  Dewey's patrol jeep is parked in the driveway. 
Despite loud music, BLARING from an inside stereo, this is a quiet moment. 
TATUM Maybe Cotton Weary is telling the truth. Maybe he was having an affair with your mom. 
SIDNEY So you think my mom was a slut too? 
TATUM I didn't say that, Sid. But you know there were rumors. Your dad was always out of town on business. Maybe your mom was a very unhappy woman. 
SIDNEY If they were having an affair how come that Cotton couldn't prove it in court? 
STU Which is you... 
RANDY So while they're off investigating a dead end, Billy, who's been written off as a suspect, is busy planning his next hunting expedition. 
BILLY (o.c.) How do we know you're not the killer? 
Randy spins around to find Billy right behind him.  Busted. 
RANDY Uh...hi, Billy. 
BILLY Maybe your movie-freaked mind lost it's reality button? 
Randy shrugs, laughing it off. 
RANDY You're absolutely right. I'm the first to admit it. If this were a scary movie, I'd be the prime suspect. 
STU And what would be your motive? 
RANDY It's 1995--motives are incidental. 
EXT.  MAIN STREET - LITTLE LATER 
Dewey's patrol jeep makes it's way down mainstreet.  It's almost dark.  The street is close to deserted. 
INT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS 
Dewey's behind the wheel having a heated conversation with Tatum while Sid stares out the window. 
DEWEY A party? Mom's gonna kill you. Then me. 
TATUM Don't be so self-righteous. It's just a little blow out--we'll be perfectly safe. 
Sid stares out the window. CLOSED SIGNS fill the storefronts, a few people rush to their car, in a hurry to beat curfew. 
SIDNEY God, look at this place, it's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. 
DEWEY Hey, I saw that movie. True story, 'bout some killer in Texas. 
TATUM Hey, Sid. Just think if they make a movie about you. Who's gonna play you? 
SIDNEY Oh, god... 
Dewey comes to a stop, parking the car in front of the police station. He looks to Sid with a brotherly smile. 
DEWEY I see you as a young Meg Ryan myself. 
SIDNEY Thanks, Dewey. But with my luck they'd cast Tori Spelling. 
EXT.  PATROL JEEP - CONTINUOUS 
They pile out of the jeep.  Dewey heads for the station. 
DEWEY I'll just be a few minutes. Don't go far. 
The girls take off for the local supermarket that sits across the street. 
SIDNEY Is Billy going to be there tonight? 
TATUM He better not be. I told Stu to keep his mouth shut. I think we can live without EVERYBODY'S ALL AMERICAN for one night. 
They approach the grocery store.  Small and simple.  Sid and Tatum grab a shopping cart from the bin and enter the store, pushing the cart through two sliding glass doors. 
A lone CHECKOUT LADY behind the counter, big and frumpy, looks up from counting money. 
CHECK OUT LADY You girls gonna have to hurry it up. We're under curfew. 
TATUM Two minutes tops. 
They make a bee-line for the junk food section just as the automated doors slide shut behind them and a... 
GHOST MASKED FIGURE appears, out of nowhere, standing just outside, watching, quietly through the glass store windows. 
EXT.  POLICE STATION - SHERIFF'S OFFICE 
Sheriff Burke's face heats up as Deputy Riley marches in, hurriedly. 
SHERIFF BURKE Dewey! Where the hell you been, boy? 
DEWEY Keeping my eye on Sidney. 
SHERIFF BURKE Listen up, Dewey, because it's bad. Real bad. Aircomp just faxed us. The calls were listed to Neil Prescott--Sidney's father. He made the calls with his cellular phone. It's confirmed. 
DEWEY Couldn't his cellular number have been cloned? 
SHERIFF BURKE There's more. Guess what tomorrow is? The anniversary of his wife's death. It all fits. He's our man. 
DEWEY Have you contacted the bureau? 
SHERIFF BURKE They believe he's out of state by now. We'll keep roadblocks and curfew in effect through the night. If he's not picked up by morning--we'll do a house to house. 
DEWEY You think he could still be in town? 
SHERIFF BURKE He'd have to be crazy. Where's Sidney? 
Tatum and Sid enter with groceries.  Various FRIENDS greet them. 
TATUM Caterer's here. 
The girls carry bags through a hallway that opens up onto an enormous kitchen.  Stu and some GUYS are leaning over the sink drinking beer through a funnel. 
TATUM That's mature. 
STU Where you guys been? We had to start without you. 
EXT.  STU'S HOUSE - ROAD 
The newsvan pulls up and parks unobtrusively on the side of the road a few feet down from the front yard. 
INT.  NEWSVAN 
Kenny and Gale move around inside the van.  Kenny hovers over a control panel complete with video monitors. 
KENNY What's the plan? 
GALE Prep the compact, we'll hide it in a window and tape all of tonight's festivities. 
Kenny picks up a compact video camera the size of his fist.  He checks its battery pack. 
KENNY The control board's glitched. You know we can't carry a live picture. 
GALE What's the delay? 
KENNY About thirty seconds. 
GALE As long as it records I don't give a shit. We're not doing a remote. 
Gale slides open the side door and steps out into the darkness, not seeing the FIGURE that stands behind her.  A hand grabs her shoulder, Gale's heart stops as she spins around to find... 
Dewey, smiling, extremely pleased to see her. 
DEWEY Evening, ma'am. 
GALE Deputy...good evening. 
DEWEY What brings you out to these parts? 
GALE You never know when or where a story will break. 
DEWEY Not much story here. Just a bunch of kids cutting loose. 
GALE Then what are you doing here? 
DEWEY Keeping an eye on things. Checking the place out. 
GALE Mind if I join you? 
Dewey considers for a whole two seconds. 
DEWEY Not at all. 
Gale leans in the van, grabs the camera from  Kenny's hand, and throws it in her bag.  She gives Kenny a wink. 
INT.  KITCHEN 
CLOSE ON a microwave.  Popcorn POPS inside.  CAMERA WIDENS TO REVEAL... 
Sid, Stu, and Tatum moving about the kitchen, preparing a junk food feast.  Other TEENS pop in and out. Randy appears amongst them.  He carries an armful of videos. 
RANDY I thought we'd make it a BLOCKBUSTER night. 
He lets the videos splatter across the kitchen counter.  Stu and Tatum dive in. 
STU I thought everything was checked out. 
RANDY I had 'em hid in the foreign section. 
Sidney peruses the videos. 
SIDNEY THE FOG, TERROR TRAIN, PROM NIGHT --How come Jamie Lee Curtis is in all these movies? 
RANDY She's the Scream Queen. 
STU With that set of lungs--she should be. 
TATUM (to Sid) Tits--see. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - FEW MINUTES LATER 
The party is going strong.  Ten maybe fifteen people stand, sit, lean.  Some crowd around the floor in front of the television. Randy is taking a vote. 
RANDY How many EVIL DEAD'S? (hands go up) How many HELLRAISER'S? 
Hands go up.  BICKERING AD-LIB, etc. 
The doorbell RINGS.  Stu goes for it. 
STU I got it. Tatum get me a beer. They're in the fridge in the garage. 
Tatum leans over and, with her elbow, hits the garage door button. BRRRMM!  It begins to rise. 
She moves towards the rising door, beer in hand.  Suddenly, CRR- BRRRM!  The garage door RESETS, reversing direction, moving down, closing. 
TATUM What the... 
Tatum spins around to see.. 
A GHOST MASKED FIGURE 
Silhouetted in the dark, next to the kitchen door, his hand on the switch.  Tatum at once GASPS, taken back, but then relaxes. 
TATUM Is that you, Randy? Cute. 
The FIGURE stares at her, blankly. 
TATUM And what movie is this from? I SPIT ON YOUR GARAGE. 
Tatum takes a step towards the FIGURE. 
TATUM Lose the mask. If Sidney sees it, she'll flip. 
The FIGURE shakes his head slowly from side to side. 
TATUM Oh, you wanna play psycho killer? 
The FIGURE slowly nods. 
TATUM Can I be the helpless victim? 
The FIGURE slowly nods again. 
TATUM Okay, let's see. "No, please don't kill me, Mr. Ghostface. I want to be in the sequel." 
Tatum takes a step to move around the FIGURE, but he steps too, blocking her. 
TATUM Cut, Casper. That's a wrap. 
Tatum moves again, sidestepping the FIGURE, but he's faster and cuts her off. 
Tatum juggles the beer against her chest with one hand and with the other pushes the FIGURE hard, knocking him aside. 
TATUM Randy--will you stop? 
But as the FIGURE intercepts, lunging forward, grabbing her wrist hard, Tatum stumbles...beer cans hit the floor, spewing... 
TATUM You little shit. 
Tatum yanks hard, releasing his hold when a flash of silver catches her eye.  She looks down, glimpsing a long sharp blade as it darts forward, cutting into her forearm... 
Tatum pulls back, horrified, as the moment turns deadly serious. 
The FIGURE advances on her--knife out, ready.  She staggers backwards, holding her bloody arm, backing into the refrigerator, SCREAMING. 
TATUM Who are you? 
The FIGURE lashes out with the knife.  Tatum dodges it, leaping back against the fridge.  The FIGURE advances.  Instinctively, she rips the top freezer door open, BASHING the FIGURE in the face, sending him backwards, reeling. 
Tatum bolts to the...CLOSED GARAGE DOOR.  In a panic, she BEATS and PULLS on it, trying to make it lift.  She eyes the FIGURE...he's recovering... 
She goes for the pet door, dropping to the floor, diving for it...she wedges her upper body through, her head, shoulders, torso just as the... 
FIGURE pounces, grabbing hold of her feet.  Tatum goes crazy SCREAMING and KICKING trying to get through. 
EXT.  GARAGE DOOR 
Tatum is half in/half out of the pet door.  She BEATS and JERKS wildly, unable to see the FIGURE on the other side... 
A true fighter, Tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the FIGURE, knocking him away. 
She takes the moment to pull herself through further...but she stops...stuck.  She pulls and tugs but can't move.  She listens but hears nothing.  Where did he go?  An agonizing silence.  And then... 
CRR-BRRRM!  The garage door is activated.  It begins to rise upward, taking Tatum with it.  She SCREAMS MADLY. 
TATUM NOOOOOOOO..... 
Tatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free herself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up... 
She looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage rafters just as her neck hits the first beam, SNAPPING instantly. 
INT.  FOYER - MINUTES LATER 
It's getting late and SOME KIDS leave through the front door, muttering, "parents and curfew", etc.  The door hangs open wide. Sid moves to close it when.... 
BILLY appears in a classic fake scare. 
SIDNEY Billy? Jesus, you scared me. 
Stu appears. 
STU (with a wink) Dude. What are you doing here? 
BILLY I was hoping Sid and I could talk. 
The camera sits on the book shelf lodged between two knickknacks, completely inconspicuous. The CAMERA WIDENS to reveal several TEENS watching the TV--the horror diehards. 
TEEN #1 Look, here it comes. SPLAT! 
TEEN #2 The blood's not the right color. Why do they do that? It's too red. 
RANDY Here comes another... 
TEEN #3 Predictable. Knew he was going to bite it. 
BORED TEEN How can you watch this shit over and over? 
RANDY Shhhhh. 
STU I wanna see Jamie Lee's breasts. When do we see Jamie Lee's breasts? 
RANDY Not until TRADING PLACES in '83. Jamie Lee was always the virgin in horror movies. She didn't show her tits until she went legit. 
BOY TEEN No way. 
RANDY That's why she always lived. Only virgins can outsmart the killer in the big chase scene in the end. Don't you know the rules? 
Stu finishes his beer. 
STU What rules? 
Randy hits the pause button on the remote and stands in front of the television, explaining. 
RANDY There are certain rules that one must abide by in order to successfully survive a horror movie. For instance: 1. You can never have sex. The minute you get a little nookie--you're as good as gone. Sex always equals death. 2. Never drink or do drugs. The sin factor. It's an extension of number one. And 3. Never, ever, ever, under any circumstances, say "I'll be right back." 
STU Wanna another beer? 
RANDY Yeah. 
STU I'll be right back. 
Everybody "ooohhs". 
RANDY There he goes folks--a dead man. Wave bye-bye. 
INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS 
Gale and Kenny watch the monitor.  The party is clearing out some 
A RAP at the van door.  Gale pulls it open to see Deputy Riley standing, his face all smiles. 
DEWEY Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me. 
GALE What kind of lead? 
DEWEY A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road. 
GALE I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright? 
DEWEY Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town. 
GALE Can I bring Kenny? 
DEWEY (too quickly) NO! I mean...I should probably take just you. 
Gale steps out of the van turning back to Kenny. 
GALE I'll be back. 
She slides the van door closed. 
EXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS 
Gale heads for Dewey's patrol jeep. 
DEWEY Actually, I thought we could walk. It's not far. 
Gale appears skeptical, but smiles anyway.  She's genuinely smitten by this young guy. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
SCARY MUSIC fills the room.  The party is reduced to the diehards in front of the television. 
RANDY (pointing to TV) Look, here comes the obligatory tit shot. 
OTHER GUYS Beautiful! Finally! 
INT.  BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Billy and Sidney are going at it...passionately.  He has his head buried in her neck. 
SIDNEY (to herself) "Eight is enough to fill our lives with love..." 
It's working.  Sidney pushes Billy off her as she pulls her shirt over her head.  She fumbles with the clasp of her bra as the... 
CAMERA RUSHES IN on her breasts.  Just as Sid's bra straps slide of her shoulders... 
Billy moves in front of the CAMERA, pulling his jeans off, Blocking Sidney from view. 
She unlocks the door and pushes on it.  But it won't give...she pushes on it again.  It's locked from the other side.  Shit.  She turns to the staircase. 
EXT.  DARK ROAD - CONTINUOUS 
A long, deserted country road.  In the distance, a single flashlight beams ahead, the only light in the black night.  Gale and Dewey can be heard. 
GALE So is Dewey your real name? 
DEWEY Dwight. Dewey was something I got stuck with a long time ago. 
GALE I like it. It's... sexy. 
DEWEY Nah... it's just this town's way of not taking me serious. 
GALE What about Gale Weathers? I sound like a meteorologist... 
CLOSE ON Gale and Dewey, walking closely, side by side- flirtatiously.  Gale is surprisingly nervous. 
GALE People treat me like the Antichrist of television journalism. 
DEWEY I don't think you're so bad. 
Gale smiles. 
GALE Are all the local boys as sweet as you? 
Dewey blushes.  He starts to say something when headlights appear behind them.  They both spin as TWO CARS loaded with KIDS come racing right at them. 
Dewey grabs Gale and pushes her off the road... just as the cars speed by, oblivious to them. 
IN THE DITCH 
Gale lands face up with Dewey right on top of her.  He steals a glance in her eyes before rolling off her. 
DEWEY You okay? 
Something takes Gale's attention. 
GALE What's that? 
Dewey looks to where gale points.  He finds the flashlight and aims it into the bush.  The tail end of a car is just visible. 
DEWEY Looks like a car. 
Dewey helps her up and they move to it.  He shines the flashlight on the plates but it's already obvious to the CAMERA.  This is the same car we last saw Sidney's father driving away in. 
DEWEY Shit. It's Neil Prescott's car. 
GALE Sidney's father? 
DEWEY We gotta get back. Jesus. He's here. What the fuck is he doing here? 
Dewey is panicked.  He grabs Gale and they race off down the road. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Randy continues to watch TV.  He is now sloppy drunk, completely involved in the movie on the screen. 
SCARY MUSIC SWELLS, filling the room. 
RANDY (to TV) No, Jamie. Look behind you! Watch out! Behind you! 
And if he followed his own advice, he would see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE that stands directly behind him...knife poised. 
INT.  NEWSVAN - CONTINUOUS 
Kenny finishes off a soda and crushes the can in his hand.  He tosses it to the floor when a movement from the monitor catches his eye. 
ON THE MONITOR is Randy, still on the couch, engrossed in the movie.  Directly behind him...the GHOST.  Kenny does a double- take.  No fucking way.  He watches as the GHOST stands still, unmoving, knife raised. 
KENNY JESUS...FUCK... 
The GHOST takes a silent step forward. 
KENNY (screaming at the monitor) BEHIND YOU! LOOK BEHIND YOU! 
This kid needs help.  Kenny bolts out of his seat and goes for the side door.  He slides it open and sticks his head out as... 
A LONG, SHARP BLADE 
comes at Kenny, fast and furious...slicing into his throat.  Kenny falls forward...out the door as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE is upon him. 
THE CAMERA PANS TO THE MONITOR 
just in time to see the GHOST MASKED FIGURE turn away from Randy, leaving him unharmed, moving instead, out the front door, on a thirty second walk to the newsvan. 
INT.  ATTIC - CONTINUOUS 
The attic is long and narrow...cluttered with furniture, boxes, and the likes...moonlight filters in through a small raised window on the front wall of the house. 
Sidney moves through the attic...BUMPING into this, KNOCKING over that...she passes a dusty mirror, jumping at her own reflection. She cringes at her image, drenched in Billy's blood.  She stares long and hard...something about the blood, the redness of it.  She moves on, determined. 
She eyes the raised window above her...a way out...if she could only reach it... 
SIDNEY APPEARS 
in the middle of the road, drenched in blood, very much resembling a young Sissy Spacek. 
Gale swerves to miss her, but she turns too sharp and the van veers off the road at top speed...flipping over on its side, sliding off into the thick foliage. 
EXT.  ROAD - CONTINUOUS 
Sidney races to where the van lay on it's side.  Sidney peers through the windshield...Gale's body lay limp and bloody. 
SIDNEY CRIES OUT, turning, limping to the driveway.  She sees the patrol jeep with it's open door...she goes for it. 
INT.  JEEP 
Sidney hops in, reaches for the ignition...NO KEYS!  Shit.  Just then, Sidney's eyes go to the front porch.  She watches as the front door opens and a FIGURE appears in the darkness, undetectable. 
Sidney throws the headlights...illuminating the front side of the house, revealing... 
DEWEY STANDING IN THE DOORWAY. 
SIDNEY DEWEY! 
Sidney opens the jeep door, moving to him, noticing his body, slumped, knees buckled... 
And then his body falls forward, slowly, deliberately, hitting the porch hard.  Standing behind him is... 
THE GHOST 
SIDNEY SCREAMS FROM THE BOTTOM OF HER SOUL. 
SIDNEY NOOOOOOOO!!!!! 
Sid jumps back inside the jeep, closing the door, locking it.  She reaches over and locks the passenger's door and then she...waits. 
And watches as the GHOST leans over Dewey's still body, fumbling with something.  Then the FIGURE stands upright, in his hands he holds... 
THE KEYS 
They jingle in the wind, the GHOST toying with her, enjoying this... 
Sidney, hysterical, locks eyes with the FIGURE as he moves to the door, Sidney leaps on it, holding the lock button down, making it impossible to unlock.  Her face is pressed against the glass...inches from the MASKED FIGURE. 
She uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the GHOST DISAPPEARS, dropping down, below the window, out of her view. 
Sidney moves to the center of the jeep, trying hard to listen over her own RAPID BREATHING, every sound AMPLIFIED. 
Then she hears it, the soft JINGLING of keys near the passengers side door.  She pounces on the lock, holding it down. 
A shadow cuts the beam of the headlights, unseen by Sidney.  The lock turns on the other side.  Sidney leaps over and holds it down, securing it.  This is beyond nerve-racking.  Sidney is certifiable. 
Her eyes spot the police radio for the first time.  She grabs the mouthpiece and hits the switch. 
SIDNEY Help! Please! I'm at Stu Maker's house on Turner Lane. Please, HE'S GONNA KILL ME! 
EXT.  FRONT OF JEEP 
ANGLE through front windshield.  Sidney RANTING into the police band.  She doesn't see the... 
GHOST FIGURE open the tailgate door of the jeep and slowly crawl in behind her. 
The GHOST FIGURE reaches out and grabs hold of Sidney's neck. 
Sidney, with surprising strength, spins around and attacks the GHOST. 
She falls back against the dash, legs out, kicking wildly at him. 
Her hand reaches for the door, finds the lock, the door lever, she pulls... 
The door swings open... 
Sidney falls out of the door, hitting the ground. 
EXT.  FRONT YARD - CONTINUOUS 
Sidney, on her stomach, squirms away from the jeep.  She brings herself up to her hands and knees, looking behind her to see nothing... 
THE GHOST HAS DISAPPEARED. 
Sidney's eyes roam the yard but he's nowhere.  Completely gone. Vanished.  Sid crawls to the front porch where... 
DEWEY'S BODY LAY 
Thinking quickly, precisely, she reaches to Dewey's holster and grabs his gun when a VOICE ECHO'S behind her... 
VOICE (o.c.) Sidney! 
She turns to see Randy racing to her, limping.  He appears stone cold sober. 
RANDY Jesus, Sid. We gotta get out of here. 
Sidney throws the gun forward. 
SIDNEY Stop. Right there. 
RANDY Stu's flipped out. He's gone mad. 
Slowly, a small smile creeps across Billy's face. 
BILLY "We all go a little mad sometimes." 
Randy squints, confused, as Billy aims the gun at Randy and pulls the trigger.  The BLAST throws Randy's body against the wall before sliding to a heap on the floor...still. 
BILLY Anthony Perkins--PSYCHO 
BILLY TURNS TO SIDNEY... 
Who stands only feet away, face aghast... 
Fuck, no...this can't be happening.  Billy's eyes are on her, unmoving. 
He sticks his tongue out and slowly licks the blood dried to his face...tasting it. 
BILLY Corn syrup. Same stuff they used for pig's blood in CARRIE. 
Sidney is dumbfounded.  Slowly, she takes a step back, moving into the dark refines of the kitchen. 
Billy, lurches forward in a fake-out, baiting her.  She takes another step back--petrified. 
CLOSE ON BILLY'S FACE.  It is no longer familiar to Sidney.  There is something inhuman now about his features.  His expression is pure evil. 
She takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen. 
THE CAMERA TAKES A MOMENT TO ADJUST TO THE DARKNESS as the outline of a FIGURE appears... 
STANDING RIGHT BEHIND SIDNEY. 
She continues to back up, moving right into the arms of... 
STU 
Sidney spins around...her mouth open in speechless horror. 
SIDNEY Stu...please...help me... 
Stu stares back at her, eyes wide, lips curled in a subtle smile as he holds a small compact CELLULAR PHONE up to his face. 
STU (whispering into phone) Surprise, Sidney. 
His VOICE sounds affected now...the VOICE of the killer. 
Sidney looks back to Billy, then to Stu, then to Billy again.  It becomes all too clear. 
She stands between them, her mind racing, calculating... 
SHE BOLTS INTO THE LIVING ROOM 
If for no other reason than to put space between her and them...they stand in the entryway, trapping her in. 
BILLY Where ya going? It's not over yet. We've got one more surprise--Stu, I believe it's your turn. 
STU Oh yeah 
Stu disappears into the kitchen. 
BILLY (to Sidney) What's wrong? You look like you've seen a ghost. 
Sidney stands, trying hard to hold a calm resolve. 
A NOISE comes from the kitchen.  A low dragging sound.  Stu reappears from the front hall...wrestling with something...someone... 
CLOSE ON STU...he has a body in tow, he thrusts it forward and it rolls into the living room.  Sidney looks down to find... 
HER FATHER 
bound and gagged.  His eyes wide in fear, very much alive. 
SIDNEY Daddy! 
She starts for him. 
BILLY Close enough. 
Stu places the cellular phone in Mr. Prescott's shirt pocket. 
STU Guess, I won't be needing this anymore. 
SIDNEY Why are you doing this? 
STU It's all part of the game. 
BILLY It's called GUESS HOW I'M GOING TO DIE! 
SIDNEY Fuck you. 
BILLY We already played that game. You lost, remember? 
STU You have to play, Sid. Don't want to disappoint your dad. He's been waiting around all night. 
STU Everyone dies but us. We get to carry on and plan the sequel. Let's face it, these days--you gotta have a sequel. 
Stu takes the knife and cuts at Billy. 
SIDNEY You sick fucks--you've seen one too many movies. 
Billy looks at her, bent over, crazed. 
BILLY Oh Sid, don't blame the movies...Movies don't create psychos. Movies just make psychos more creative. 
Stu staggers a bit. 
STU That's it, Billy. I can't take any more. I'm feeling woozy. 
BILLY Get the gun. I'll untie Pops. 
Billy moves to Sidney's father. 
STU Where'd you put it? 
Stu is searching the foyer for the gun. 
BILLY It's on the table. 
STU No, it's not. 
Billy hobbles over.  The gun is gone. 
BILLY Where the fuck is it? 
VOICE (off camera) Right here, asshole. 
Billy and Stu look up in unison to see... 
GALE WEATHERS-CORRESPONDENT FROM INSIDE STORY 
standing in the front door way, gun in hand.  Her body tattered and bloody.  Her hair a mess. 
BILLY I thought she was dead. 
STU She looked dead. Still does. 
Gale holds the gun firm, in total control. 
GALE I've got an ending for you. The reporter left for dead in the newsvan comes to, stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day. 
Sidney steps forward. 
SIDNEY I like that ending. 
Billy lunges at Gale, but she holds steady.  Billy and Stu eye each other. 
BILLY She can't get both of us. 
STU Odds are--she'll miss anyway. 
In a mad rush, they storm Gale, heading straight at her.  She pulls the trigger, but nothing happens...the safety is on. 
Billy charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, SLAMMING IT SHUT.  It catches Gale in the face, knocking her backwards out the door.  She goes down...out. 
STU Cool move. 
Billy steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where Gale lays.  Then he turns back inside the house to find... 
SIDNEY GONE. 
BILLY Where'd she go? 
Stu looks around, staggering now, bleeding heavily...Sidney has completely disappeared.  Only her father, bound and gagged remains in the living. 
STU I don't know Billy but I'm hurtin'. 
BILLY Where the fuck did she go? 
Suddenly, the phone RINGS.  Billy and Stu look at each other. Completely surprised.  Billy scrambles over to the phone. 
BILLY (picking up phone) Hello? 
SIDNEY (from phone) Are you alone in the house? 
Billy looks to Mr. Prescott.  The cellular phone is gone. 
BILLY You bitch--where the fuck are you? 
SIDNEY Not so fast.  We're gonna play a little game. It's called GUESS WHO JUST CALLED THE POLICE AND REPORTED YOUR SORRY MOTHERFUCKING ASS? 
Billy looks around the living room. 
BILLY Find her. 
Billy is fuming now...slightly staggering...and starting to lose it.  He SCREAMS at Stu who has fallen to his knees. 
BILLY FIND HER YOU DIPSHIT!

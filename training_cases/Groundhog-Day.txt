ROLL CREDITS AND THEME MUSIC 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. A FOREST CLEARING - EARLY MORNING 
The crust of an old snowfall still covers the frozen ground, and the bare, icy branches of the trees glisten dully in the early morning light. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME 
PHIL CONNORS is standing in front of a blank green wall gesticulating animatedly at some invisible images on the wall, talking a mile a minute (MOS) . He looks completely crazy as he points at nothing and winks to an unseen audience. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA - SAME TIME 
CREDITS CONTINUE as we streak across the winter landscape, flying over fields and farms, small towns and hamlets, railroad lines and interstates, coalyards and factories, until we cross the Allegheny River and follow it to the southwest. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TV STUDIO - SAME TIME 
Phil continues pointing out features on the blank wall , but from a new angle we can see that he ' s looking at a monitor out of the corner of his eye which shows the chromakey insert he's pointing to -- a national weather map. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEAR PITTSBURGH - SAME TIME 
The country towns turn to suburbs, traffic on the roads gets heavier and finally we see the skyline of Pittsburgh and the confluence of the Allegheny with the Monongahela and the Ohio. 
We zoom into a tall building in the downtown area and 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PHIL CONNORS' OFFICE - MORNING 
We don't see anyone at first but the office itself speaks volumes about it's inhabitant-- team pictures of the Steelers from the Franco Harris-Terry Bradshaw glory years, a framed memorial portrait of Roberto Clemente, a local Emmy award statue, an erasable weather map and mountains of personal junk on the desk, ^windowsill, and every other available surface. As the CREDITS END, we notice a sleeping figure on the small sofa, buried deep under a pile of coats and a stolen airline blanket. GIL HAWLEY, Executive Producer of the Action News, sticks his head in the door. 
HAWLEY Christ, what a pit. Phil" The sleeping figure rouses himself and looks out at Hawley. It's Phil, the .Channel 9 Action News weatherman. 
PHIL 
(SLEEPY) What? 
HAWLEY It's February first, Phil. You know what tomorrow is? Phil sits up and.thinks hard. He's in his mid-thirties, smart, rugged-looking, perhaps a little too full of himself, but clearly a guy with a lot of personality. 
PHIL (catching on) Oh, no! Not again. He jumps up and exits the office with Hawley right behind him. 
PHIL Forget it! I'm not going. 
INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
Hawley pursues Phil through the office suite of the Channel 9 Action News, from the look of it a typical, big city, local news operation. A logo on the wall identifies the station as WPGH - Pittsburgh. Phil ducks into the studio. 
INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS 
Hawley follows him in and catches up with him at the weather corner of the Action News set. Phil starts putting weather stats up on a chart. 
PHIL Get away from me. I'm working. 
HAWLEY So what's the outlook? We gonna get that blizzard? Phil shakes his head and points to the chart which is headed "Phil's Phorecast" with a cute caricature of himself drawn next to the title. 
PHIL No way. All that moisture coming up from the Gulf is going to miss us completely and take a dump on Harrisburg. 
He takes off the headset, gets up and closes the door for privacy. 
PHIL 
(KINDLY) You didn't do anything wrong, Stephanie, and I ' m not tired of you. It's just that I don't have time for a real relationship right now. I told you that the first time we went out. 
STEPHANIE (getting close) Everybody says that at the beginning of a relationship. 
PHIL (gently pushing her 
AWAY) I'm different. I really meant it! Things are really starting to move for me now. I ' m not going to be doing the weather for the rest of my life. I was just talking to the CBS guy about a network job. I want that. This is just the beginning for me. I can't waste any more time. 
STEPHANIE Are you saying our relationship was a waste of time? 
PHIL Our relationship? We went out a total of four times! And only twice did anything happen. It was fun but I don't see that as a big commitment. 
STEPHANIE (closing in again) I had our charts done. My astrologer says we're extremely compatible. There may even be some past lives involvement here. 
PHIL See? So we've already done this. Let's move on. Next case. 
STEPHANIE You know what's wrong with you, Phil? You're selfish. You don't have time for anyone but yourself. 
PHIL That's what I ' m trying to tell you. You don't want to be with me. You can do better. Look, Stephanie, if I ever said or did anything to mislead you I'm sorry for that, but right now I have to do this groundhog thing and I don't have a handle on it yet. He throws some papers and his datebook into a briefcase and puts on his jacket. 
PHIL (CONT.) I'll tell you what. I ' m going to do some serious thinking while I ' m in Punxsutawney, okay? He pats her on the shoulder and brushes past her, leaving her standing there with a malevolent look on her face. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. A HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON 
A VAN marked ".Channel 9 Action News" speeds along a two-lane highway through the winter landscape of West Central Pennsylvania. Mounted atop the van is a microwave transmitter. Rita is riding up front with LARRY, the union cameraman and techie. Phil is following close behind the van in a new Lexus coupe. His car has a bumper-sticker that reads "Weathermen Like it Wet." 
PHIL (V.O.) (on his earphone) I'm on my way to Punxsutawney... (forced to repeat it, a little embarrassed) Punx^su-taw-ney....Work or fun? I think that all depends on you. 
INT. THE LEXUS - CONTINUOUS 
Phil is talking to one of his girlfriends, sorting through a stack of CD's, as usual, grabbing at the good life with both hands. 
PHIL . . . . I thought maybe you could meet me up there tonight and let me vulgarize you for about seven hours....So I ' m supposed to spend the night in Punxsutawney all alo ne? Thanks. 
Phil loads a CD and a great, driving song kicks in. 
CUT TO: 
A SIGN "Welcome to Punxsutawney - The Original Weather Capitol of the World Since 1887." Depicted on the sign is a large cartoon GROUNDHOG wearing a top hat and clutching an umbrella under his arm. The mini-convoy passes some fast food places on the outskirts of town. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - PUNXSUTAWNEY - LATER 
The van drives along , the small-town main drag. There are cartoon groundhogs everywhere you look and the whole town has been gaily festooned with banners and bunting. 
EXT . MOTEL - LATER The van pulls into the parking lot at a Quality Inn. The announcement billboard in ;front of the motel reads: "Groundhog Day Breakfast Special - Feb.2 - All You Can Eat - $5.99." The parking area is already crowded with cars including a number of other news vans. The Lexus pulls in behind the van and everybody gets out. Phil takes one look at the motel and shakes his head. 
PHIL (calls out) Rita! I can't stay here. Rita is already helping Larry unload equipment from the van. 
LARRY 
(MUTTERING) Prima donnas. 
RITA It's okay. I'll handle it. She crosses to the Lexus where Phil is trying to make another call on his earphone. 
RITA What's the problem, Phil? 
PHIL I hate this place. I stayed here two years ago and I was miserable. It's like a minimum security prison. I'm not staying here. 
RITA You're not staying here. 
PHIL 
(BRIGHTENING) I ' m not? 
RITA No, Larry and I don't care but I thought you might, so I booked you at a very nice bed and breakfast on Cherry Street. Here's the address. She hands him a card. 
PHIL 
(PLEASED) Great. That's great. That's the mark of a really good producer. Making the talent happy. 
RITA Whatever I can do. 
PHIL You don't have to rush off, you know. That storm is 'going to miss us completely. 
RITA Nice working with you, Phil. See you around. Rita walks away, leaving him sitting alone. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
Phil's Lexus is driving down the highway. Light snow is just starting to fall. 
PHIL(V.O) (on the earphone) I'll call you after I see the network guy. I should be back there in a couple of hours...What?...1 can't hear you-- you're breaking up...Hello? Sabrina? 
INT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Phil is getting annoyed as the phone connection deteriorates. The snow is getting heavier. Phil switches on the windshield wipers. 
PHIL Sabrina ? Can you hear me? Shit! He slams the phone back into it's cradle, then looks up and notices slow traffic up ahead. He honks his horn as the traffic comes to a complete stop. He keeps honking but nothing moves. He rolls down the window and looks up ahead. The highway is a parking lot. 
PHIL No. No! 
EXT. THE CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Phil jumps out and begins to walk down the highway, past the parked cars, shivering in his light sweater and silk sport shirt. The snowfall is getting heavier and the wind is pickin up. The snow comes down unnaturally hard and fast. He walks on, slipping and sliding in his expensive loafers until he j comes to a police roadblock up ahead, manned by TWO HIGHWAY 
"J PATROLMEN. 
PHIL What's going on, Officer? 
PATROLMAN Nothin's goin1 on. We're closin1 the road. Big accident up ahead. Blizzard movin1 in. 
PHIL What blizzard? A couple of flakes! An isolated phenomenon of nature. 
PATROLMAN Are you nuts? We got a major storm movin' in. 
PHIL No, no. All that moisture is going to miss us and hit Harrisburg. 
PATROLMAN Pal, you got that moisture on your head. 
PHIL But I have to get to Pittsburgh today! 
PATROLMAN Mister, the only place anybody's goin' on this road is back to Punxsutawney. Phil glowers at him and shivers. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GAS STATION - LATER 
Phil is on a pay phone. Snow is falling heavily outside. GAS STATION ATTENDANT is shovelling around the pumps. 
PHIL So all the long distance lines a re down? What about the sa tellite? Is it snowing in space?...But I have to call Pittsburgh...Isn't there some special line you keep open for emergencies or for celebrities?...Well, I'm both really. I'm a celebrity in an emergency. Can you patch me through on that line? 
The door opens and Phil is blasted with frigid Arctic wind and blowing snow. The GAS STATION ATTENDANT enters the tiny office and in trying to squeeze past Phil accidentally bangs him on the head with his snow shovel. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL BAR - EVENING 
Phil is at the bar in Punxsutawney ' s oldest and best hotel , the Pennsylvanian. He looks very bored, drinking a beer, unsuccessfully hustling an attractive local girl named NANCY. 
PHIL You never saw me on TV-- on the news? 
NANCY I don't think so. What part of the news do you do? 
PHIL I ' m the White House correspondent for NBC news. 
NANCY Oh , I ' m so sure . 
PHIL Ask me anything? 
NANCY Okay, how big is the White House? 
PHIL Three bedrooms, two and a half baths. Looks much bigger than it , is. Nancy just stares at him, clearly not into his sense of humor. Suddenly, a BRIDE in full white wedding gown and veil rushes into the bar, crying and shouting. A gaggle of BRIDESMAIDS flutters around her trying to coax her back to her own wedding but she won't budge. Then the GROOM, wearing a bad rented tux, comes storming in and tries to drag her back, until the BEST MAN restrains him and the bridesmaids hustle the bride away. Phil watches the whole drama play out, then turns back to Nancy . 
PHIL Good start. I ' m sure they'll be very happy. So what do you say? You want to play doggie obedience school with me? 
NANCY Thanks. I'll pass. She gets up to leave. 
PHIL Sit! Stay! He watches her go, then tosses a tip on the bar and exits somewhat unsteadily. 
Rita looks at him like he's crazy, then looks at her watch and gives up. 
RITA Larry! She charges off toward the cameras. In the Press Area, several reporters are already talking to their cameras, dribbling on about how "He could appear any second now." Rita and Larry grab their gear and rush back to Phil. Larry hurriedly sets up the camera. 
LARRY You want me to roll tape? 
RITA (to Phil) Are you going to get on your mark? 
PHIL No hurry. Larry glances over at the other news reporters, all talking to their cameras and pointing towards the mound. 
LARRY 
(DESPERATELY) Everyone else is rolling! Rita looks helplessly at Phil. 
RITA I'm begging you, all right? Gould we please just do this? Phil glances down at his watch. 
PHIL Okay, let's do it. He crosses over to Larry and taps him on the shoulder. 
PHIL Roll tape. 
LARRY 
(MUMBLING) Prima donnas. Phil takes the microphone from Rita and positions himself against the fence. 
LARRY Rolling. 
Phil does a similar intro to the one he did before, though this time it's a bit tentative. 
PHIL (to camera) We ll, it's Groundhog Day-- again-- and you know what that means. Everybody's here on Gobbler's Knob waiting in the cold for the appearance of the most famous groundhog in the world, Punxsutawney Phil, who's going to tell us just how much more of this we can expect. The Groundhog Club Official knocks on the groundhog's door, then opens it and retreats. Phil takes a deep breath and makes his first experimental prediction, recalling the previous day. 
PHIL My forecast is we're going to see the groundhog peek its head out of its hole, look around a little bit, then he's going to come out, scamper over to this general area, look at the crowd for a second, make a little burping noise and run back into the ground. 
RITA (whispers to Larry) That's it. I'm going to kill him. Phil looks at his watch. 
PHIL O k ay ? And here we go-- Phil points to the hole and Larry zooms in. The groundhog sticks his head out, looks left, looks right, steps out of the hole, and runs away from the press pool, directly over to Larry's camera. As he stands there, his body casts a long shadow. The groundhog looks right into the camera, lets out a squeak, and runs back into the hole. Rita and Larry are completely amazed as the crowd cheers the brief appearance of the groundhog. Larry pans back to Phil. Phil just stands there speechless, staring at the groundhog burrow. 
RITA 
(HISSES) Phil! Buster Greene, the Groundhog club official, walks onto the mound and hushes the crowd, exactly as before. 
BUSTER He came out, and he saw his shadow. Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but it looks like it's going to be a long winter. Again the crowd lets out a good-natured "Awwwwww" in disappointment. Larry pans back to Phil just in time to see him walking away in a fog, without signing off. Then he pans back to Rita. 
RITA (at a loss) For Channel 9 News, this is Rita Hanson in Punxsutawney. She holds for a moment then makes the cut sign, drawing her finger across her throat. 
CUT TO: 
- LATER 
INT; PHIL'S ROOM Phil is on the phone desperately trying to make a call. 
PHIL (on the phone) I know there's a blizzard, but I have to get a call through to my doctor in Pittsburgh. It's a medical emergency. . . .No, don't give me the Punxsutawney Fire Department. When do you think the long distance lines will be working again?. . . But what if we don't have a tomorrow? We didn't have one today, my friend... Hello...Hello? He hangs up and shakes his head which is now really starting to ache, then he pops a handful of Tylenol, lies down and pulls the covers up over his head. A moment later, he sits up, takes a pencil from the nightstand, breaks it in half and puts the pieces back on the nightstand. Then he lies back down and retreats back under the covers. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP - CLOCK The digital clock-radio changes from 5:59 to 6:00 AM. The radio comes on, playing the end of the Sonny and Cher hit, "I Got You, Babe," just as it did the day before. 
INT. PHIL'S ROOM - DAWN 
Phil sits up in bed fearing the worst and looks on the nightstand. The pencil is whole again. Completely stunned by the phenomenon, he jumps out of bed and starts dressing hurriedly as the morning Deejays begin their now familiar rap. 
DEEJAY Okay, campers, rise and shine, and don't forget your booties because it's COOOLD out there today! 
SIDEKICK It's cold out there everyday. What is this-- Miami Beach? Phil rushes out of the room. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHERRY STREET - LATER 
Phil hurries toward the bed and breakfast carrying two gallon buckets of paint, and a couple of big bags from a hardware store. 
INT. BED AND BREAKFAST - CONTINUOUS 
Phil enters and passes Mrs. Lancaster in the breakfast room. 
MRS. LANCASTER Painting something, Mr. Connors? 
PHIL I ' m conducting an experiment. 
PHIL No, really. It's like today never happened. I shaved my head last night, today its all grown back. I could probably cut off my limbs, one by one, and - pop! They'd grow back. Just like a starfish. I probably don't even have to floss? 
RITA I'm wracking my brain, but I can't even begin to imagine why you'd make up something like this. 
PHIL 'Cause I'm not making it up. I'm asking for your help. Rita looks at him for a long moment. 
RITA Okay, I'll bite. What do you want me to do? 
PHIL The truth? I'd 1ike you to spend the next 24 hours with me and don't leave my side for a second. 
RITA I see. You know, Phil, you can charm all the little P.A.'s at the station, all the secretaries, and even some of the weekend a nchors, but not me-- not in a thousand years. 
PHIL Wa it a second-- 
RITA Not if I was dying and your breath was the only cure; not if having your child was the only way to preserve the human race. Just get it out of your head because it is NOT GOING TO 
HAPPEN! 
PHIL So much for the truth. Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their table. 
LARRY (to Rita) You ready? We better get going if we're going to stay ahead of the weather. 
RITA Yeah, , I ' m . ready, Larry. 
(EXITING) Good luck, Phil. 
CUT TO: 
INSERT X-rays of Phil's skull are slapped up onto a light box. 
INT. MEDICAL CLINIC - DAY 
Phil is having his head examined by a NEUROLOGIST. 
NEUROLOGIST No spots, no tumors, no lesions, no clots, no aneurisms. Everything looks fine and dandy to me, Mr. Connors. Have you considered psychiatric help? 
CUT TO: 
INT. PSYCHOLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY 
Punxsutawney's only PSYCHOLOGIST is a marriage and family counselor at the local Lutheran church. His appearance and manner indicate he may have some serious problems of his own. 
PSYCHOLOGIST (not too confident) That's kind of an unusual problem, Mr. Connors. Most of my work is with couples and families. Phil is lying on a couch. His head is completely shaved. 
PHIL Yeah, but you're still a psychologist. You must have had some course in school that covered this kind of thing. 
PSYCHOLOGIST Sort of, I guess. Abnormal Psychology. 
PHIL So based on that what would you say? 
PSYCHOLOGIST 
(HESITANT) I ' d say that maybe you're -- I don't know -- a little delusional. 
PHIL You're saying this thing is not really happening to me? 
PSYCHOLOGIST Uh-huh. 
PHIL Then how do I know this conversation is really happening? 
PSYCHOLOGIST I guess you don't. 
PHIL Then forget about me paying you. A discreet little alarm sounds. 
PSYCHOLOGIST 
(RELIEVED) I'm afraid that's all the time we have, Mr. Connors. 
PHIL Wait! Are you saying I'm crazy? 
PSYCHOLOGIST (humoring him) Not necessarily. If it concerns you we should schedule our next session as soon as possible. How's tomorrow for you? Phil glowers at him. 
CUT TO: 
INSERT - A MODEL OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM A SCIENTIST in a white lab coat is holding up the model. Phil looks on with interest. 
SCIENTIST 
PHIL (starting the ear) Seatbelts. Ralph and Gus give him the thumbs up sign and start digging around in the seat cracks for their seatbelts. Suddenly, Phil floors the accelerator and peels away, sideswiping a parked car as he screeches around the corner. 
INT. THE BUICK - CONTINUOUS 
Phil is having a great time. Gus and Ralph are whooping it up like kids on a roller coaster. 
PHIL This is great, Ralph! 
RALPH Oh, hey, take a left! Phil passes the intersection. 
RALPH You missed it! 
PHIL No problem -- 
EXT . MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS Phil throws the car into a high-speed, skidding U-turn, goes up on the curb, across a couple of lawns, takes out a mailbox and a STOP sign and bounces back onto the street. A POLICE CAR parked in front of the hardware store pulls out and takes off after him. 
INT. THE BUICK - CONTINUOUS 
Phil swerves in and out of oncoming traffic. Gus is starting to look a little green. 
PHIL So many rules -- 
RALPH You can say that again. 
PHIL "Don't do this--" 
EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS 
The Buick demolishes a parked car. 
PHIL (V.O.) "Don't do that -- " He mows down a row of parking meters. 
POLICE CAR It comes screaming around a corner in hot pursuit of the Buick 
INT. THE BUICK - CONTINUOUS 
Ralph hears the siren and looks back at the police car. 
All right! Try and stop us, you mothers ! 
PHIL No more rules! 
RALPH No more rules! 
EXT. THE STREET - CONTINUOUS 
A second police car joins the chase. 
RALPH (looking back) That's two! 
PHIL Having a good time? 
RALPH I'm having a great time! Phil speeds up to a hundred miles and hour. Gus is looking even worse from the liquor and the motion of the car. 
GUS Hey, uh -- 
PHIL Phil. 
GUS Yeah, Phil-- like the groundhog. 
PHIL Right. 
GUS Hey, Phil? How're we going to get out of this? 
THEIR POV - THE INTERSECTION AHEAD Two police cars with lights flashing are parked sideways, completely blocking the road. Officers stand in the roadway, motioning for Phil to stop. 
PHIL 
(CALMLY) Gus, you're just going to have to trust me on this one. He tromps the gas pedal to the floor. Gus's eyes go wide with terror. The police dive out of the way. 
PHIL AND RALPH Yahooooo! 
THEIR POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD The Buick crashes head on into one of the police cars. 
BLACK OUT: 
C LOSE UP - CLOCK The time changes from 5:59 to 6:00. The radio starts playing "I Got You, Babe." Phil sits up suddenly and looks around, completely amazed. He is in his room at the bed and breakfast, everything exactly the same as before. He hops out of bed and quickly examines himself for signs of physical injury. Nothing. The music ends and the two deej ays come on. 
NANCY Is this some kind of come-on? 
PHIL I'm not really sure. We'll have to see. Phil walks off and joins Rita at their camera position. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DINER - LATER THAT MORNING 
Phil is sitting at his usual table, which is covered with an incredible variety of rich foods-- eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, pies, cakes, eclairs, ice cream, puddings, etc. Rita sits across from him, watching in amazement as he stuffs himself with pastry. 
RITA Is this some new fad diet? Don't you worry about cholesterol? Phil scrapes a plate and takes a final bite of a chocolate eclair. 
PHIL I don't worry about anything anymore. 
RITA What makes you so special? Everybody worries about something. 
PHIL That's exactly what makes me so special. He takes a big bite of cake. Rita shakes her head. 
PHIL (with his mouth full) What? 
RITA "The wretch, concentered all in self, Living, shall forfeit fair renown, And doubly dying, shall go down to the vile dust from whence he sprung, Unwept, unhonored, and unsung." Sir Walter Scott. 
PHIL (stares at her for a long moment) "There was a young man from Na n t uc k e t-- " 
RITA That's really funny. When are you going to grow up, Phil? 
PHIL At this rate-- never. (he pulls out a pack of 
CIGARETTES) Okay if I smoke? Rita shrugs. Phil lights up a cigarette. 
RITA You really do have a death wish, don't you? 
PHIL Just the opposite, Rita. I have a life wish. I'm just trying to enjoy it. Taking pleasure in the little things. Don't you ever just want to cut loose and go wild? 
RITA I wouldn't even know what it means to go wild. 
PHIL Yeah, well, that's where I come in. Going wild is one of my specialties. Last night I got completely loaded and drove head- on into a police car. 
RITA 
(DISBELIEVING) Oh, really? You look pretty good this morning. 
PHIL That's my point. I know you won't believe me, but we could do anything we want today and it wouldn't matter one bit. Absolutely no consequences. Complete and total freedom. 
RITA And how. . , do we manage that? 
PHIL You leave that to me. Why don't you send Larry back and hang out with me for the rest of the day? You never make it through that blizzard anyway. Larry enters the diner and spots them. 
RITA I'll take my chances with the -weather. But you have a good time. 
PHIL Don't worry. I plan to. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GOBBLER'S KNOB - NEXT MORNING 
Phil comes through the crowd and finds Nancy in the same spot she was in the day before. 
PHIL Nancy? Nancy turns and looks at him quizzically. 
PHIL Nancy, right? 
NANCY I'm sorry, I-- 
PHIL Nancy Taylor? Lincoln High? I sat next to you in Mrs. Walsh's English class. 
NANCY T h at -- 
PHIL Phil Connors. 
NANCY --is amazing! 
PHIL You don't remember me, do you? 
NANCY I don't-- sure, I think-- 
PHIL We used to shoot spit balls-- 
Phil kisses her on the lips and walks off. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PENN BANK AND TRUST - DAY 
Two harmless-looking old GUARDS are calmly loading bags of cash into an armored car parked in front of a local bank. Suddenly Phil appears, wielding a shotgun, wearing a Batman style cape, his face completely hidden by a ski mask. 
PHIL 
(SHOUTS) All right, freeze!! Drop your guns J! The guards stand there frozen with terror. 
PHIL You guys ever been held up before? (they shake their 
HEADS) It's kind of exciting, isn't it? 
FIRST GUARD 
(FRIGHTENED) I guess so. Something to tell the kids about. 
PHIL Yeah. By the way, I'm Phil. He raises the mask and shows his face. 
FIRST GUARD Herman. 
S E C O N D GUARD Felix. 
PHIL (shaking their hands) Herman and Felix. Okay. Take it easy, boys. And thanks. The frightened guards watch as Phil makes off with two large satchels of cash. 
CUT TO: 
INT. USED CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY 
Phil pats the hood of a used BMW 850 sports car as a SALESMAN stands by beaming. Phil is wearing a full Steelers football uniform complete with shoulder pads. 
SALESMAN A real beauty, huh. We picked it u p at a-- 
PHIL I'll take it. How much? 
SALESMAN Well, the sticker says $62,999 bu t if you want-- 
PHIL I'll tell you what. I'll give you $70,000 if you just knock off the car salesman stuff and let me get out of here with my car. The Salesman gawks as Phil opens his briefcase and starts counting out stacks of bills. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PUNXSUTAWNEY - DAY 
From a high angle, we see the BMW tearing around the streets of the town as if running a Grand Prix road race. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 
The BMW comes screeching to a stop right in front of the movie theater and the door opens. A pair of really elaborate cowboy boots complete with silver spurs hits the pavement first; then we PAN UP to see Phil emerge from the car wearing a really gaudy; full cowboy outfit with real six-guns on his hips. A very trashy-looking girl, LARAINE, gets out on the passenger side, dressed like a French maid. 
LARAINE (very self-conscious) I thought we were going to a costume party. 
PHIL Yeah, we are, we are. But first I have this movie theater fantasy I want to talk to you about. He escorts her into the theater. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TATTOO PARLOR - ANOTHER DAY 
Phil is lying on the table, getting elaborately tattooed. Rita walks by, looks in the window and is shocked to see Phil there. Phil waves at her and points to the colorful new heart pierced by a bloody dagger being tattooed on his arm. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BIKER BAR - NIGHT 
We pan down the line of ROUGH TRADE PATRONS to. Phil, dressed all in black leathers, both arms heavily tattooed, looking like Sid Viscious on crack. He takes off his hat to reveal red, white and blue hair shaved almost down to his skull. A slut named ANGIE and another overweight, not very pretty MADONNA WANNA-BE, both in too-tight jeans and bullet bras are coming on to him, practically licking his ears. Angie pops a couple of mystery pills into his mouth. Phil washes them down with a shot and a beer. 
I 
CUT TO: 
INT. PHIL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
It looks like ;outtakes from Fellini's "Satyricon." Heavy metal is blaring from the radio, as several unsavory looking men and women are partying down, a few already passed out, sleeping off whatever hit them. Someone is knocking loudly on the door, shouting complaints about the music. A beer bottle smashes against the door. Phil is sitting up on the bed with Angie. He has his arm around her shoulder and a fifth of Wild Turkey in his hand. 
PHIL You'd what? 
RITA I don't know what. 
PHIL Then maybe you'd like me? She stares hard at him. 
RITA I don't know. It's sort of like the way I feel about UFO's. I'd have to see it to believe it. Larry pokes his head in the doorway, looks around, spots Rita and makes his way over to their table. 
LARRY (to Rita) You ready? We better get going if we're going to stay ahead of the weather. 
RITA Yeah, I'll be right out, Larry. Larry scowls at Phil and exits. 
PHIL (to Rita) Why don't you stay for a while? The road's going to be closed anyway. Do you really want to be stuck in the van with Larry for three hours? 
RITA I've got to get back. I'll see you later. Phil watches Rita exit. 
PHIL'S POV Rita gets in the news van and drives off with Larry. Phil stares out the window, more" determined than ever to win her over.

RITA

PHIL Wouldn't you know it. Buy you a drink? 
PHIL (making mental note) No white chocolate. 
RITA There's something so familiar about this. Do you ever have deja vu? Phil smiles. Then Larry enters. 
LARRY (irate, to Rita) I don't believe it. Someone bought every distributor cap in this town. We're going to be stuck here all night1 Over Phil's sympathetic look we hear the song, "I Can't Get Started With You".

EXT. MAIN STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT 
There is a light snow falling. Phil and Rita are making a little snowman. Somehow the town looks magical tonight-- old fashioned, wholesome. A snowball hits Phil in the back. He and Rita turn around to see a giggling KID. Phil packs a snowball and tosses it. The kid throws one back. Rita and Phil both get into it, packing snowballs and getting into a war with this kid and his little gang of friends. A snowball catches Rita unaware, she slips and goes down in a snowbank. Phil bends down to help her and slips. They are no together, lying in the snow, laughing. Their eyes lock for a long sweet moment, then Rita gets embarrassed and stands up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT . CHERRY STREET INN - NIGHT Phil and Rita are walking slowly, very close. 
PHIL What? 
RITA I ' m just amazed. And I'm not easily amazed. 
PHIL About what? 
RITA How you can start a day with one kind of expectation and end up so completely different. 
PHIL Do you like how this day is turning out? 
RITA Yes. I like it very much. They stop dn front of Phil's hotel. She turns to him. 
RITA You could never have planned a day like this, but it couldn't have been more perfect. 
PHIL You're wrong. I've been planning this day for weeks. Rita ignores the remark and hugs him. Phil tries to kiss her but she gently puts her fingers to his lips, stopping him. \ They enter the bed and breakfast inn. 
INT. VESTIBULE - CONTINUOUS 
Rita hugs him again and starts to exit. 
RITA Thanks. See you tomorrow.

RITA (very reluctant) I don't know, Phil-- 
PHIL No·reason to end a perfect day. 
RITA

PHIL Why not? Rita, I love you! 
RITA You don't even know me! 
PHIL (grabs her hand) Please! You have to! Rita shakes loose from his grasp. 
SECOND HUSTLER So what's your name?

The crowd is waiting expectantly for the groundhog to appear Phil is a wreck, squatting unprofessionally in front of the camera. 
PHIL 
(CYNICALLY) This is one of the most pitiful spectacles known to civilization. With one nod from a filthy rodent best known to pest control agencies, a moribund old coal mining hamlet turns magically into the Lourdes of Pennsylvania, Mecca to thousands of people who, if they hated the winter so damned much, why don't they move to Florida, anyway? 
Larry and Rita look on, incredulous.

BUSTER Jake! Call the police, and get the word out. Somebody kidnapped Phil. We're going after him. Come on, Tommy! They jump into a car, Buster guns the engine and takes off after the pickup. Rita runs up to Larry and grabs the camera on the fly. 
RITA Let's go! Phil just snatched the groundhog! Larry does a slow take and starts gathering up the rest of the gear.

RITA 
PHIL! NO! 
EXT. LOGGER'S LEAP - CONTINUOUS 
The pickup bursts through a retaining fence and rockets over the edge of the cliff. The pickup seems to hang in the air for a long time, then it begins its SLOW MOTION descent, falling ever so gracefully until it impacts on the granite rock face far below. BIG EXPLOSION. BIG FIREBALL. FLAMING WRECKAGE. Then a small click, followed by "I Got You, Babe." 
DISSOLVE TO: 
RITA Why are you telling me this? 
WAITER 
(SHRUGS) Because some people like blueberry waffles. 
RITA (to the waiter) No t you-- him. 
PHIL Because I want you to believe in me.

WAITER I could come back if you're not ready. 
PHIL How do you know I'm not a god? 
RITA Please. 
PHIL How do you know? 
RITA Because it's not possible.

RITA Lovely ring. 
DORIS Thanks. 
Phil drags Rita to the counter. 
PHIL This is Ralph. Say "Hi," Rita. Rita flashes a quick smile. 
RALPH Don't believe I've had the-- 
PHIL Ralph hates his life here and wants to drive around town smashing into policemen. 
RALPH Well, who don't? 
RITA This is some kind of trick. 
PHIL Yes, it's a trick. But maybe the real God cheats, too. Maybe God isn't omnipotent-- he's just had a lot of practice. 
RITA How about that guy? 
PHIL Tom. Worked in the coal mine ·til they shut it down. 
RITA Her? 
PHIL ' Nancy. Went to Lincoln High School in Pittsburgh. Takes herself out to lunch once a week. Rita is getting very bewildered. From their reactions she can see that Phil is right about each and every one of them. 
RITA How do you know these people! 
PHIL I told you the truth. In five seconds there's going to be a grease fire in the kitchen. Five, four-- 
RITA This is nuts. 
PHIL --three, two, one. Phil points to the kitchen as smoke starts pouring from the service window. Everyone in the diner is now staring at them 
RITA (trying to puzzle it 
OUT) Okay, enough. Let's just sit down and think for a second. (they sit) What do you know about me, Phil? Do you know me, too? Phil takes a long pause. 
(BLUSHING) Phil! It's not funny. She catches up to him. Phil turns to her. 
PHIL You weren't interested. 
RITA 
(RELIEVED) Okay. She begins walking again. 
RITA Not that it would've been so awful. 
PHIL I understand. 
RITA I just had to know whether to smack you or not. 
PHIL You did. 
RITA Good.

EXT. PARK - DAY 
Phil and Rita are sitting on a park bench. 
PHIL So do you believe any of this? 
RITA I don't know. I don't know how else you could know so much. Maybe it is really happening. 
PHIL I used to try to stay up all night sometimes. I thought if I could stay conscious I could figure out what was going on, or at least hang onto something from the day before. But I gave up on that a long time ago. Rita looks at him with compassion. 
RITA It sounds so-- lonely. 
PHIL (trying to shrug it 
OFF) It's not that bad. You get used to it. Rita comes to a decision. 
RITA Maybe I should spend the rest of the day with you-- as an objective witness. Just to see what happens. Okay? 
PHIL Yeah, sure. That'd be okay. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PHIL'S ROOM - NIGHT

PHIL It's not in the wrist so much as the fingers. Be the hat. 
RITA It would take me a year to get good at this. 
PHIL Uh-uh. Six months. Four, five hours a day. 
RITA Is this what you do with eternity? 
PHIL Now you know. It's like waiting for a bus that never comes . You should see me play pool -- and bowling, juggling, hacky sack. I can ride a unicycle. There ' s a knock on the door .

PIZZA GUY U h hh h -- Phil pays him, takes the pizza and closes the door. 
RITA (opening the pizza box) MMMM. Pepperoni and olives. My favorite . 
PHIL Of course. I told you, I know everything . 
RITA (taking a bite of 
PIZZA) I don ' t think I ' d want to know everything that ' s going to happen. I like to be surprised. 
PHIL That's not the worst part. 
RITA What's the worst part? 
PHIL The worst part is starting over everyday. Tomorrow you won't remember any of this. You'll go back to treating me like a complete jerk -- 
RITA No -- 
PHIL I was saying that the cow was eventually returned to it's rightful owner. 
RITA (drifting off) Really? 
PHIL That's right. He looks at her, sees she's truly asleep, and gently maneuvers her into a comfortable reclining position on the bed. Then he carefully puts a pillow under her head and settles down next to her. 
PHIL What I was going to say was, I think you're the kindest, sweetest, prettiest, most wonderful girl I ever met in my life. She starts to stir but he gently kisses her back to sleep. 
PHIL Shhhh. That's good. (satisfied she's still 
ASLEEP) I could never tell you this, but from the first minute I looked at you I wanted to just hold you close and be with you forever. iEverytime I -saw you around the station, I thought my heart was going to explode. I used to dream about us being together. In my dream you loved me as much as I loved you and we didn't have to say anything but I knew you understood everything. She stirs again but he kisses her until she returns to deep sleep. 
PHIL I know a guy like me could never deserve to have someone like you, but if I did, I swear I would love you for the rest of my life. Rita opens her eyes. 
RITA 
(HALF-ASLEEP) Did you say something? 
PHIL Good-night, Rita. He kisses her gently on the forehead. 
RITA Good-night, Phil.

RITA Really? 
PHIL I mean, maybe we should go for it. What do you think? 
RITA Sounds good to me. Larry? 
LARRY Sure, why not? 
RITA All right. Thanks, Phil. Good work. She reaches for an equipment case.

PHIL What? 
RITA Nothing. I just can't believe you're such a fine sculptor. Phil takes a bite of her apple and gets up.

NED Phil! Phil Connors! I thought that was you! 
PHIL Ned? Ned Ryerson! I don't believe it. I've missed you so much. 
Phil gives Ned a big hug and keeps holding on for an uncomfortably long time, actually giving Ned a hickey on the neck. Ned goes into homophobic shock.

PHIL I really don't know. 
RITA No, there's something going on with you. 
PHIL Okay, I wake up in Punxsutawney on February second -- every day. It's supernatural. I don't even try to explain it anymore. So, I live each day as if it's the only day I've got. Rita stares into his eyes for a very long time, but sees only good, true things. 
RITA That's pretty amazing. " 
PHIL You want to know what's really amazing? I've been waiting for you every day for ten thousand years. I dream of you every night of my life. You've been my constant weapon against total despair, and just knowing you exist has kept me alive. How's that? Rita can't even speak. This is clearly the nicest thing anybody has ever said to anybody. Mary the piano teacher notices Phil. 
MARY Phil! (to her friend) This is the guy. 
PHIL Hello, Mary. Rita, this is one of Punxsey's finest musicians. 
·MARY Give me a break. You should talk. Why don't you play something? 
PHIL N o , I-- 
MARY Please. 
FRED Hey, Mr. Connors. Go for it. Phil looks at Rita. She nods and shrugs. Phil walks up to the platform and sits at the piano. He begins to play a slow, serious, classical piece. Everyone falls silent. It's so beautiful, Rita is almost in tears. Then, after a pause to let the serious notes sink in, Phil transforms the piece into a fast, lively, upbeat jazz romp. Everyone is delighted, and as the rest of the band kicks in, everyone grabs a partner and begins to dance. An old coot, UNCLE LEO, grabs Rita and the two of them dance up a storm. 
LEO That's a great guy you've got there. Doctor Connors fixed my back, you know.

RITA Making a snow man? I'll help.

Phil is using a stick and the heat of his bare hands to model a delicate fold in the snow sculpture. Several bystanders look o n with interest as Phil stands back from his work. 
RITA Can I look? 
PHIL O kay, look. 
It is an excellent likeness of Rita, the snow white as alabaster, pure as marble, a beautiful and delicate homage.

Uzodinma Iweala 
May 8th, 2014 SHOOTING SCRIPT 
FORWARD NOTE: 
The dialogue in this screenplay is faithful in form to the novel, originally written in a lighter form of Nigerian Pidgin English known as Krio. 
Krio (and its various dialects) is used as a lingua franca throughout West Africa, from The Gambia to Cameroon, and is spoken by millions. 
FRONT CREDITS OVER BLACK: 
The KRIO-accented VOICE of AGU (10). 
AGU (V.O.) It is starting like this... 
EXT. VILLAGE FOOTBALL PITCH - DAY 
Angle on: the plastic exterior of a screen-less television. 
Through it we see children running in circles on a football pitch. 
Angle on the boy balancing it on his head, AGU (10), a warm smile and clever eyes. Next to him, DIKE, his littler best friend. 
AGU Which ones having talent? 
DIKE That one...not that one. 
EXT. VILLAGE MARKET - DAY 
Agu passes a line of YOUNG MEN lying on wheel barrows while carrying the TV. Dike and their YOUNG RECRUITS, the kids they were scouting on the football pitch, follow suit. 
EXT. ECOMOD CHECK POINT - DAY (FORMERLY SC. 14) 
Agu and Dike drop the TV down on a stool in front of the VILLAGE CONSTABLE, charming it up. 
VILLAGE CONSTABLE Agu, what am I supposed to be doing with this? 
AGU Watching TV, Massah. 
VILLAGER CONSTABLE It is not having a screen. 
AGU It is imagination TV. 
Agu has the YOUNG RECRUITS perform, framed in the empty space of the demolished television. The Constable is unimpressed. 
VILLAGE CONSTABLE It is garbage. Go, get out of here. 
Agu disappointed but not discouraged, looks at the PEACE OBSERVERS with optimism. 
EXT. ECOMOD TROOP TRANSPORT - DAY (FORMERLY SC. 15) 
Agu stands in front of white helmeted NIGERIAN troops. The 2ND LIEUTENANT humors him. 
2ND LIEUTENANT It doesn't have any channels. 
Agu turns the knob swiftly. 
AGU It is having 12, and one more, that is the imagination channel. 
He addresses his YOUNG RECRUITS to PERFORM again. The 2nd Lieutenant is amused. 
2ND LIEUTENANT And how much for this treasure? 
AGU 3000. And you are giving us some of your foods. 
2nd Lieutenant motions to his CORPORAL to get something out of the carrier. The corporal comes back with several PLASTIC CONTAINERS OF RICE AND SAUCE. 
2ND LIEUTENANT Take these. 
Agu reviews the food. 2nd Lieutenant pulls out a pack of gum from his side pocket to sweeten the deal. Agu snatches up the takings, giving some cash to Dike and his recruits. 
EXT. NATIONAL HIGHWAY - DAY 
AGU (V.O.) Big Brother, he is more concerned with his muscles, and his skin. Sometimes I add to his products. 
INT. AGU AND BIG BROTHERS ROOM - DAY 
Big Brother has captured Agu and is rolling him up in a thick carpet that makes it impossible for him to use his arms to escape. He looks like a tampon with a head as Big Brother props him up against the wall. 
AGU (V.O.) Big Brother is also concerned with sleeping. 
Big Brother is talking about sleeping with a girl in the village as he dances to music from a tape deck. 
AGU (V.O.) I am not liking his music, and I am not like his dancing, and if he is playing it loud loud I do not know how this girl will be sleeping. 
Fuming, Agu looks like he is about to cry as he yells at his brother to be let go. 
INT. VILLAGE CHURCH - PREVIOUS SUNDAY 
Agu sits uncomfortably on one of the church benches amongst hundreds of people listening to a PASTOR with his SUPPORT STAFF with MUSICIANS behind them. 
AGU (V.O.) I am going to church every Sunday with my family. 
He looks up, distracted, at the spinning CEILING FANS. Mother pinches his leg, motioning for him to pay attention. 
Big Brother is making eyes with a TEENAGE GIRL from across the aisle. She returns his affection coyly. 
Agu looks at Father who pretends like he is dozing to entertain Agu. 
AGU (V.O.) Father is saying that Pastor is thinking he can be talking so much because he is having his Reverend Doctorate -- that is making him doctor of "talking." 
On another pew, Dike sits with a well dressed family. They raise their chins in salutation as everyone stands to sing. 
EXT. VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY 
The PARISHIONERS spill out of the church clapping and singing in a parade of music and dance. The church brass and percussion band BLASTING A CELEBRATORY TUNE. 
AGU   (V.O.) God is liking    music more than just talking so if    we are singing and dancing, then    He is listening to us well well. 
INT. AGU AND BIG BROTHERS ROOM - FROM BEFORE 
FATHER snatches the Tape Player from the shelf, hitting the machine to make it stop. 
FATHER What is wrong with you? You know you cannot waste batteries on such nonsense! 
Agu and Big Brother can't help laughing as Father slaps the laugh out of Big Brother from the back of his head. 
FATHER (CONT'D) (TO AGU) And you? What are you doing? (to Big Brother) Unroll him. 
Big Brother snaps the carpet, spinning Agu. 
FATHER (CONT'D) Agu. What are these?! 
Father holds up several the plastic containers of food. 
FATHER (CONT'D) Well? 
AGU I... 
FATHER I?   I. I. I. what? 
AGU I got them from the Nigerians. 
FATHER We do not need handouts. We are not beggars on the street. We are not refugees. I work for this family and I provide for this family. 
AGU But I earned- 
FATHER You will return them. 
AGU Yes, Father. 
Father looks at Agu a beat longer to ensure Agu understands, then he tenders a forced smile to release the tension. 
FATHER Good dancing. (TO AGU) Go on, help Mother. 
EXT. KITCHEN HUT - DAY 
Agu's Sister sweeps the grounds between the kitchen hut and the main house with a small wad of reeds fashioned into a broom. Agu grates a long reedy root into a bowl. 
Inside the house, Agu spies FATHER resting on a chair while listening to the RADIO, a BBC-like AFRICAN CORRESPONDENT reporting... 
BBC CORRESPONDENT (O.S.) It would seem things are changing quickly within the interim government. As of this morning, the NRC junta moved to abolish all political parties, further consolidating their control of the government in the wake of the recent military coup... 
Agu's GRANDFATHER sits on a bench. His eyes are open, staring into the courtyard, but he does not appear to be awake, flies buzzing around his milky eyes. 
Father lunges after Agu. FREEZE FRAME again. 
EXT. AGU'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Agu sleeps on the front porch, afraid to go inside. 
AGU (V.O.) I am a good boy. But sometimes I am sleeping outside so I am not having to go inside and be getting a beating. 
The lights go out on the porch. Agu looks out over the town as all lights go out. 
Mother lights candles and lamps and steps out over him to see what is going on in town. 
Father walks over with his radio, shaking it for a better signal. She looks to him for an answer as a RADIO BROADCAST plays the voice of the LIEUTENANT GENERAL addressing the PLF and requesting they lay down their weapons in return for amnesty within 24 hours. 
FATHER Why so fearful? Doesn't the light go out all the time? It will come back. 
Mother holds onto Father. Agu watches them from the doorway. She turns towards him, adjusting her display of fear. 
MOTHER Go on Agu, go to bed. 
AGU No beating? 
Father brings Mother in close, Agu waits for an answer. 
INT. AGU AND BIG BROTHER'S ROOM - MORNING 
FATHER Get up! Get up, now!    We are going to church! 
Father shakes Agu awake. Agu, still groggy, hides his face from the light. 
BIG BROTHER But it is not Sunday. 
Agu sees his Father's stress. So does Big Brother. 
EXT. NATIONAL HIGHWAY - DAY 
Agu and his family watch as a long convoy of NRC Junta Army trucks enter their town. 
PASTOR (O.S.) It is saying in the Bible that God is only helping those who are helping themselves. 
INT. VILLAGE CHURCH - DAY 
Agu and family are pressed against the wall, everyone drips with sweat. 
Agu, between the towering adults, looks up at the fans but they are not turning. 
PASTOR Isn't God protecting the Israelites when they are having to leave their own home? 
Big Brother sees Agu struggling below and picks him up and puts him on his shoulders so he can see. Agu whispers to his brother... 
AGU Where is Dike? 
Agu scans the room for Dike and his family, but cannot see them. The Pastor speaks from a podium while an ECOMOD CAPTAIN, LOCAL IMAM, PARAMOUNT CHIEF holding his golden talisman, a LINGUIST, ASSISTANT PASTOR, VILLAGE ELDERS, ONE FEMALE REPRESENTATIVE sit behind him. 
Agu smiles to himself, the Pastor looks desperate to him. 
PASTOR We cannot allow ourselves to face voluntary self-destruction. May God bless us all! 
AGU (V.O.) Reverend Doctorate. 
Agu looks down at his Father to share his observation, but his father has a look that Agu has never seen before: fear. The entire room is gripped with it as they murmur their concerns and beliefs to their neighbors. 
MAN #4 What about our homes, property we leave behind? Our crops? Who will protect them? 
The crowd goes silent as the PARAMOUNT CHIEF leans forward. 
PARAMOUNT CHIEF Linguist. 
The Linguist joins him at his side, leaning over to listen. The crowd leans in, knowing that the Linguist will only filter. 
PARAMOUNT CHIEF (CONT'D) I am listening to the Pastor and to the Imam, and the representative for the women, and what they have to say is wise, but not all of it. It is right that we must be helping ourselves. (MORE) 
PARAMOUNT CHIEF (CONT'D) The NRC Junta telling us to be running away is not acceptable. Our forefathers have lived on this land for centuries. It is our duty to preserve it for our children. 
The crowd adjusts and shifts nervously. 
PARAMOUNT CHIEF (CONT'D) Now that the NRC has broken its promise and entered the buffer zone, we should be accepting ECOMOD help and be sending women and the small small children to safer areas. But we who call ourselves men must stay. 
Some of the crowd reacts in favor of the Chief while many more MOAN in fear, drowning out the Linguist's call... 
LINGUIST (shouting over the crowd) The Section Chiefs and their deputies should be assembling after this to discuss protection of this village. We all must do our part. 
The driver laughs off the suggestion. 
DRIVER 70,000. No boy. 
FATHER With the boy- 
-The driver raises his finger to shush him... 
MOTHER We will find another way. 
FATHER (TO MOTHER) No! (TO DRIVER) With the boy. 
DRIVER No bargaining. Or are you wanting your woman to be walking through the bush to the capital? 
Mother looks prideful. 
MOTHER I would rather be walking then leaving my child. (MORE) 
MOTHER (CONT'D) (TO FATHER) I am not leaving him. 
FATHER (TO DRIVER) Please. How much to fit the boy? 
DRIVER No boy. 
TWO FAMILIES, seeing an opportunity, start OFFERING MONEY to the driver to take the Mother's space. Without recourse, Father starts pushing her towards the car. 
MOTHER No. No we cannot! 
Father is picking up Little Sister to place her inside. 
MOTHER (CONT'D) No, I cannot! 
FATHER (whispering, consoling) Do not scare them. You are strong. You will be okay. Take care of them and I will take care of our boys. Now get in, there is no choice. 
Father pays the Driver as Mother kneels down to Agu, unable to speak, on the verge of breaking down... 
MOTHER Remember to be praying praying to God all the time and not to be worrying, we will be seeing each other soon. 
She hugs and kisses him, grabs his hands, before turning away. 
She slides into the front seat, the gearshift situated between her legs, Sister and Little Brother on her lap. Three more people between her and the passenger door. All are hot, uncomfortable, and scared. 
AGU Mother! 
She cannot bear to be looking at Agu, Big Brother or Father, instead, she looks a the faces around her, and then forward. 
Father holds Agu by both shoulders in front of him. Agu begins to cry. He cannot see Mother. He tries to move but Father holds him back. 
FATHER You are with the men now, Agu. Be strong, wave goodbye. 
Big Brother is holding back tears as well, struggling just as hard to be strong. 
The engine rumbles to a start spewing black smoke onto Agu and what's left of his family. 
As the car pulls away, Agu cannot help himself, he breaks away and runs after the car, crying after his mother. 
AGU Mama! 
Agu's brother grabs his hand and holds him back. 
BIG BROTHER Let's go home. 
Father looks at them tenderly. The square, filled with the sounds of straining engines and crying families. 
AGU (V.O.) And this is how it is starting. 
EXT./INT. AGU'S HOME - NIGHT 
The last light of day. 
Agu, Big Brother, his Father and Grandfather sit around a meager plate of rice and sauce. 
They eat quietly. Agu doesn't like the taste of his father's cooking. 
AGU (V.O.) If I am closing my eye, I am seeing the rainy season and how in my village, they are saying it is always bringing change too fast. You can be finding that the whole world is washing away beneath your feets. 
Father feeds Grandfather, the activity helping keep his thoughts in order. 
Outside, THUNDER rolls, or   something that sounds like it. Father is acutely aware of   it, as if it could be artillery. Agu doesn't seem to notice   as the camera moves away from the family and out towards the   wet countryside. 
AGU (V.O.) You can be walking on road and finding that you are swimming in river. You can be starting day all dry and warm and then be finishing with your clothes like another skin on your body. Nothing is ever for sure and everything is always changing. 
They break the door open. Light, air, and sounds pour into the room. Everyone SIGHS. 
BULLETS obliterate the three men by the door. GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS appear in the doorway, everyone throws their hands up in surrender. 
EXT. VILLAGE SQUARE - MINUTES LATER 
Agu, Big Brother, Father, Grandfather and several of the men sit on the ground with their hands on their heads. THREE GOVERNMENT ARMY SOLDIERS hold them at gun point, prodding them, shoving their heads, toying with them and tying them up. 
Agu notices that some of the NRC SOLDIERS ARE CHILDREN just a couple years older than himself. 
A GOVERNMENT ARMY SERGEANT interrogates them. 
SERGEANT Which faction are you fighting for? 
FATHER We are not fighters. We are from this town. We were protecting the stores. 
SERGEANT You are Native Defense Forces? 
FATHER No. I am a Section Chief. We were tasked to stop looters. 
SERGEANT (to his Corporal) Bring the woman. (MORE) 
SERGEANT (CONT'D) (TO FATHER) You are calling us looters? 
GOVERNMENT ARMY Soldiers exit buildings and connecting streets carrying looted goods. They dump them into their trucks. 
The Corporal returns with the OLD WOMAN from his jeep. 
SERGEANT (CONT'D) Do you know these men? 
The old woman looks at Father, then at Agu and his brother. She shakes her head. 
OLD WOMAN I do not know them. 
The MEN all YELL in protest. Agu looks angrily at the wretched woman. 
FATHER This woman, everyone knows she is crazy. Just talk to her, Massah, you will see she is not right in the head. 
OLD WOMAN They are not from here, they must be rebels. 
The men protest. The Sergeant nods gravely. 
SERGEANT We, the armed forces of the National Reformation Council, find you to be spies and sentence you to immediate and summary execution. (to the soldiers around THEM) Waste them. 
FATHER (looking at his boys) Run! 
The men rise, those who haven't been tied yet put their hands up and back away as the Government Army Soldiers shoot them to the ground, point blank. 
Agu and Big Brother run. 
Agu dodges around a corner as a bullet hits the wall beside him. 
Safely around the corner, he stops and looks over for Big Brother who was just a second ago behind him. Agu looks down, Big Brother is lying face down in a pool of blood. Agu reaches for his Big Brother as his body is pelted by bullets. 
Reloading, they see Agu frozen in place. They aim to fire just as Agu regains his senses and runs. 
EXT. BUSH - CONTINUOUS 
Agu slams through the bush, branches scraping past him. His flip-flops slapping the red mud. Flinging it all over him. 
The sounds of WAR gone. 
EXT. BUSH - DUSK 
Agu wanders on his own. Lost, confused, angry, his emotions overwhelming him. 
He cries drunkenly, walking deeper into the wilds. 
EXT. FOREST TREE - NIGHT 
Agu tries to sleep on a branch of a tree, he still cries a mournful sob. 
EXT. FOREST - LATER 
Agu again wanders the intermittent bush and woods. 
He finds one rotten fruit hanging from a tree. Devours it. 
EXT. FOREST CREEK - LATER 
A small babbling creek. Agu drinks water. The sounds of animals in the forest suffocating. 
The BOY who attacked Agu salutes Commandant. The Commandant addresses him... 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Strika. Is it you who is finding this thing? 
Strika nods his head proudly. Agu avoids looking at Strika as he passes him again. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Enh! Strika? Untie him. (to the other NDF Soldiers) So all of you grown men here, and it is Strika who is finding a prisoner? 
He kneels down next to Agu as more men emerge from the bush, carrying clothing and loot. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) (addressing Strika but STUDYING AGU) Where are you finding him? 
Strika points to the ground. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Here? Is that right... where is Two- I-C? Two-I-C! 
Commandant looks at FAST KILL and BONE, two of his BODYGUARDS. They yell as the human telephone courses deeper into the bush. 
FAST KILL AND BONE Two-I-C! 
Through the rustling grass, a THIN MAN emerges with a small SQUAD of MEN. His skin sweaty and yellow like tanned leather. 
TWO-I-C Commandant, sah! 
The Commandant motions for him to approach. 
COMMANDANT What are we to be doing with this thing? 
TWO-I-C This thing? It is just a boy. 
COMMANDANT A boy. 
Two-I-C is about to explain when Commandant raises his finger to quiet him. Now addressing him in front of the soldiers. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) A boy is nothing? A boy is harmless? 
Commandant looks at the NDF Small Boy Unit Soldiers near him. They scream in unison... 
NDF SBU Harmless no, sah! 
COMMANDANT Does a boy not have eyes to see? 
NDF SBU Two eyes, sah! 
COMMANDANT A boy has hands to strangle! 
NDF SBU Soldiers laugh. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) And fingers to pull a trigger. BUAH! 
Commandant simulates firing a gun towards the bush. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) A boy is not harmless. 
He looks at the men. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) A boy is very dangerous. (TO STRIKA) Strika, are you trying to be eating this boy? 
Strika shakes his head no, smiling devilishly. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) I am looking at you. You are not seeming like soldier to me. Show me your fingers. 
Agu raises his open hands. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Your hands are like babies hands. What were you doing here? Why are you just laying by the ground like one dead rat? 
TWO-I-C Sah? We need to be move- 
COMMANDANT I said wait. (TO AGU) You are from Alpha Town? 
Agu nods, shyly. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) You should be telling me. 
Two-I-C swears under his breath while looking nervously at black smoke rising above the trees in the distance. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Just tell me and I will be helping you. 
AGU My father is telling me to run. Run far far so the Army Soldier is not catching me and killing me. And then, and then I am just hiding in the bush and running running... 
COMMANDANT And where is this your father? 
RAMBO Botu botu botu. 
He points to the helicopter in the sky, then slides his finger over his neck. 
Agu looks up at it again, his face gaunt with hunger. 
AGU (V.O.) Botu botu botu. 
EXT. JUNGLE HILL - DAY 
At the front of the line, Commandant raises his hand and everyone stops. 
An NDF SCOUT steps out from behind a tree. They salute each other. 
Rambo taps Agu's shoulder. 
RAMBO Water. 
Agu dumps the ammunition and grabs a plastic jug of water to distribute to the soldiers. 
At the head of the line Commandant picks up a thick baton- like stick from between the tall ribboned roots of a giant buttress tree. He swings the baton into a ribbon and it BOOMS like a bass drum, the entire trunk turned into a resonator. 
ANGLE WIDE above the canopy of the jungle as the tree, which looms over the other trees, reverberates. 
The sound startles Agu in the midst of pouring a cup of water for a soldier, GRIOT. The naked warrior, TRIPOD, stomps past him. He looks like a giant next to Agu. 
Commandant and everyone wait. BOOM BOOM - a distant retorting response. 
Commandant signals his men to move forward. Agu runs back to pick up the bands of ammunition as the troops now move ahead past Commandant up the valley walls. 
EXT. EDGE OF NDF CAMP, FIRE POST - DAY 
NDF soldiers file past an entrenched bunker that looks out over the valley. An NDF PICKET fires in the air, announcing and celebrating their return. 
EXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP - DAY 
Commandant, Agu and the rest of the company exit the denser woods, revealing an extensive camp housing 400 NDF combatants. It is constructed from a mixture of older thatch huts and lean-tos, haphazardly dispersed in a covered section of the jungle with a parade ground at its center. 
An open grass field lies just beyond where soldiers play football. 
The NDF Soldiers greet their COMRADES who also fire into the air in celebration, as well as handing over loot and goods carried by the CIVILIANS to the CHIEF SUPPLY OFFICER. 
The rest of the soldiers disperse into their places in camp. Some continue conversing with friends as they remove all their heavy equipment, some slouch into corners to relax and rest, others light joints and take other sundry drugs. 
EXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP - SAME 
Commandant hands Agu over to Two-I-C for deployment. Two-I-C, busy with the CIVILIAN PORTERS, ignores Agu until he is done. 
TWO-I-C (to the Civilians) ...to protect life and property. If you are wanting to stay, then stay, but you must be initiated. 
All agree to stay. Two-I-C looks down at Agu. 
COMMANDANT Two-I-C. 
TWO-I-C Yes, suh. 
COMMANDANT This baby boy is your responsibility now. Train him. 
Commandant salutes and walks away with his detail. 
TWO-I-C Yes, sah. (yelling to another) C/O Hope! 
Hope runs up to Two-I-C and salutes him. 
HOPE Yes, suh. 
TWO-I-C This baby boy is your responsibility now. Train him. 
Two-I-C points to Agu and walks away. Hope appraises Agu dispassionately. 
EXT. NDF JUNGLE CAMP - DUSK 
A COOK, holding a dog and smoking a cigarette, dispenses rice and sauce from the back of a hut to Hope and his NDF Small Boy Unit Soldiers. Others exchange cartons of cigarettes for other extras, peppers and juicier cassava chunks and more rice. 
TEN NDF SBU Soldiers, including the boys Strika, Hope, Griot (17), PREACHER (16), JUSTICE (13) and CHICKEN LEGS (15) collect their ration and sit around a fire to eat. Agu is ignored. He has no bowl. 
Agu, hungry, watches them with hawkish and ravenous eyes. They use their fingers, licking every last drop of food. Preacher sings a song as he finishes his bowl of food and lets it drop. 
Agu dives for it. He runs to where the cook was dispersing food but there is none left. The DOG, the Cook's pet, licks the rest. 
Despondent, he uses his hands to gather what little is left in his own bowl, then drops to the level of the dog and competes for scraps. 
Agu chops again. The THUD vibrates up his arm, droplets of blood suspend in the air and sparkle. 
Anger, memories of his father and his brother, gunned down in the street fueling anger he didn't know he could muster starts swinging harder. 
Strika walks over with his rifle and helps Agu. Together, they stomp and cut with increasing furry and vigor until the man's face becomes unrecognizable. 
Agu, suddenly feeling sick, rushes to the grass to vomit. 
Commandant pulls him up. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Watch his blood, Agu. That is justice. That is what God wanted. 
Agu looks up at Commandant, then at Strika. Common understanding, mutual blame, between them. 
Agu wipes the blood from his face, the NDF Soldiers celebrate, firing into the air, SING and dance around the dead government soldiers. It is a great victory. 
AGU (V.O.) Mother, I have kill a man. 
A mosquito drowns in blood. No one notices this but Agu. 
AGU (V.O.) It is the bad sin and I am feeling like I am dying inside, like each breath can be my last and my heart will stop its beating. But I am knowing, too, it is the right thing to be doing. 
EXT. NATIONAL HIGHWAY - DUSK 
NDF SOLDIERS SING A RHYTHMIC SONG while organizing the looted clothing and weapons. SEVERAL are already dressed in the new clothes taken from the Government Soldiers. 
Agu and Strika dig through one of the vehicles looking for any contraband. Agu finds CIGARETTES under a seat and shows them to Strika. 
TWO CIVILIAN TRUCKS arrive from down the road loaded with SQUADS of Commandant's NDF forward strike troops. 
Mechanics fix the engines of the lighter convoy vehicles. Supplies are finished loading. Platoons and Companies re- organize. 
Machine guns and anti-aircraft guns are mounted on the trucks, turning them into improvised attack trucks: a.k.a., TECHNICALS. 
Two-I-C hands Commandant one of the Government Soldier's nicer FN-FAL RIFLES. 
Commandant checks the chamber, looks down the barrel from the breech, replaces the loaded clip into it, turns towards Agu and gives it to him. Two-I-C is surprised. 
COMMANDANT Always keep it with you. 
TWO-I-C If you are losing it, then I will be losing you. 
Commandant winks at him to affirm their pact. Strika approaches with some captured Army accoutrements in hand. 
COMMANDANT You are my Special Guards now. (TO STRIKA) Both of you. 
Strika stands at attention and salutes affirmation, as does Agu, mimicking Strika. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) (to his CSO) CSO. Take note and act accordingly. 
CSO Suh. 
COMMANDANT Agu and Strika are now my Special Guards. 
CSO, not knowing what that actually means, just agrees. 
CSO Yes, suh. Special Guards. 
Agu sits down with his rifle, looking at it proudly. 
AGU (V.O.) Always be keeping it. If you are losing it, then they will be losing you. 
Strika tosses Agu a pair of green army pants and an ammunition vest. 
Agu holds them up. Far too large but he tries them on anyway, using a piece of hemp as a belt. He looks up to thank Strika but he is already chasing after Commandant. 
EXT. SAVANNAH - MORNING 
The NDF Convoy cuts through the rolling countryside, past burnt frames of vehicles. Agu rides with Strika in the back of Commandant's truck. 
EXT. SAVANNAH - MORNING 
NDF SBU Soldiers spread out in the bush, scavenge for food. Agu and Strika play, a rare glimpse of childish fun for them. 
Hope and Griot chop through the plants when suddenly a BUSH RAT dashes out of its hiding spot. Excited, they swing their rifles around and OPEN FIRE, killing it and nearly killing each other. 
Agu and the other SBU run to see what they shot when the horn of the CONTROLLER sounds off, like the WHISTLE of a tea kettle, heralding the distant thumping of a HELICOPTER. 
COMMANDANT Gentlemen! Cover! Cover! 
Agu looks at Strika. 
COMMANDANT Explain. 
TWO-I-C It's very difficult, suh. Our     men are fighting bravely but- 
COMMANDANT But nothing. Take the bridge, that is your task. 
Commandant motions for the MORTAR MAN to set up a mortar to help the HILL ADVANCE. 
EXT. ROAD TO BRIDGE, BURNT VILLAGE - SAME 
Two-I-C and his forward operation team are hunkered down behind a building facing a PLF stronghold -- TWO MACHINE GUN nests with sand bags in front of the heavily defended bridge which looks like a former check point. 
TWO-I-C We need support, suh. The men's spirts are low, suh. 
Behind Two-I-C there is general chaos. The men are not advancing and many are retreating. JUSTICE is yelling at the men around him to help him carry an injured RAMBO to safety, but no one will help him. 
He is driven to tears in the chaos, spinning in circles trying to get a grown-up to help him as Rambo bleeds out on the street. 
COMMANDANT (O.S.) Sustain. 
EXT. BURNT VILLAGE, CENTRAL INTERSECTION - DAY 
Commandant lets his radio hang around his neck, watching the HILL BATTLE progress again. 
COMMANDANT Agu, Strika, come here. Look at this. 
Agu and Strika obey. Commandant holds the scope up for them. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) This is a very special device, you can be seeing the enemy with it, even when they are hiding. 
Agu, through the scope, sees the FORWARD STRIKE NDF SOLDIERS unload and disperse. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) You see? 
He motions for the mortar to fire. Agu looks through it while the first blasts force the PLF to scurry. Strika, impatient for his try, paces. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) It's magic. (to the men) I need volunteers! Who has heart? Who wants to fight with me? Who isn't afraid of bullets!? 
The men ROAR BACK in affirmation. Commandant moves amongst the men, placing his hand on their chest, feeling their hearts. 
When it's Strika's turn to look, Commandant interrupts his try by asking him if he has heart for battle. Conflicted between wanting to try out the scope and the call for battle, he affirms he is ready to fight while the "toy" is put away by the Aide. 
Commandant selects men and boys to go with him, those who aren't selected are pushed aside and kneel down in shame and disappointment. Amongst the selected are Agu, Strika, Hope, Chicken Legs, and Griot. 
An AA technical rushes back around the market towards the intersection under a hailstorm of bullets and clouds of smoke, PREACHER is in the back firing back with RANDY and a couple other SBU's. 
The Technical screeches into position at the top of the intersection leading to the bridge. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Chicken Legs, go! 
Chicken Legs runs to the intersection with Griot in support, to fire an RPG down on the bridge. 
The SELECTED TEAM, about 20 MEN and SBUs, advance towards the bridge. 
EXT. ROAD TO BRIDGE, BURNT VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER 
Commandant CHANTS a war chant, "no retreat, no surrender, men dropping, men moving". The men respond to the CHANT, all of them, a battle cry that rouses. They keep huffing into the chant as Commandant addresses them... 
COMMANDANT These bullets? 
The WHISTLE of bullets increases and, where most rational men would duck, has no affect on Commandant. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) They are nothing. No one can touch us! 
The Commandant pulls a chanting Agu up near him and uses him as an example. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Are you afraid? 
Agu shakes his head, even if inside he is afraid. 
Commandant, along with Tripod and the Controller. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Moove it!    Gentlemen! Moooooove it! 
The NDF SOLDIERS YELL again. A NERVE TINGLING BATTLE CRY. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) No retreat! No surrender! Men dropping! Men moving! 
The bullets whistle by angrily. Then, a tidal wave of wind and fire is laid down on them, tearing up a building's wall and wooden kiosks around them. The men do not flinch, they believe they cannot be hit, although some MEN do go down, the majority continues the advance. 
Agu is astonished, but because everyone else keeps moving, so does he. To his left, Commandant smiles at him, loving the adrenaline of battle. TRIPOD prancing in front of them. 
Commandant lays out a line of brown-brown. He snorts it and beckons Agu to do the same. Agu, having seen others do this, knows how, but has never experienced it. He sniffs eagerly. The Brown-brown going straight to his head. 
COMMANDANT You are wanting to know how to be leading? 
AGU No, sah. I am happying to be following you, sah. 
His nose tingles. 
COMMANDANT That is good, Agu, because there is no learning to be leading. Some men is born to leading, other is born to following, and other is only waiting to be dying. 
AGU I am following you, sah. 
COMMANDANT No, Agu. You are different. You are reminding me of me when I was a little boy, and this means you are borning to be leader. But even the best leader Agu, must first be learning to be good follower. Sometimes I even have to be following the Supreme Commander, if when I am not agreeing. 
AGU Yes, sah. I am a good follower, sah. 
Commandant points at the map. Lines of two highways intersect near the bottom center. He points at it. 
COMMANDANT You are seeing this place. Supreme Commander is saying this is important. So it is important for me then. 
Agu nods. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) If we get this place, then we can go to Taro. Is that where your mother is? 
AGU I am thinking she is in the Capital, sah. 
COMMANDANT After Goodblood greets us, we all will be going to the Capital, that is a certainty. 
Agu nods. It is hard for him to think of her without feeling emotions, and he doesn't want to show Commandant these childish emotions. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) I am wanting to be helping you more than the others, Agu. 
Preacher SINGS somewhere in the encampment. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) But do not be telling anyone I am helping you like this, this will be our secret. Can you be keeping this secret, Agu? 
AGU (PLEASED) Yes, sah. 
And with Commandant's attention, he is able to forget, for this instance, his mother again. 
COMMANDANT Then be saying it. 
AGU I can be keeping this secret, sah. 
COMMANDANT In this family where I am being father, we cannot have the other children getting jealous, Agu! 
He rubs Agu's head, roughly. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Kneel down in front of me. You do me this thing. 
Agu, respectfully, kneels down in front of Commandant as he blows out the lantern light. It is near darkness except for the campfires outside. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) I am not punishing you, Agu. I am helping you, to care for you. 
He touches Agu on his shoulder, then his hands drift down Agu's arm to his hand. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) This is what commanding officer is supposed to be doing to his best boy soldier. Play with him, cherish him, protect him, enh? 
He brings Agu's hand down towards his own genitals. Agu is too afraid to move. Commandant moves Agu's head towards his crotch. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Touch my soldier, Agu, with your mouth. This is a command. You took an oath to obey, and now obey. 
Agu's moves to do as he is told. We TILT AWAY AND UP to Commandant, leaning back and mentally departing. 
EXT. EDGE OF BURNT VILLAGE - NIGHT 
Agu's face appears out of the darkness, illuminated by the lantern lights. His face shows excruciating pain. Everyone is already asleep, so he tries to walk quietly, but it is too painful. He whimpers. 
Strika has been waiting for him. Agu collapses into Strika, crying. Strika holds him. They lay amongst all the other NDF Soldiers, who are already sleeping. 
AGU (V.O.) Strika. He is my only friend, Mother. His eye are too red, his teeth are too brown, his head is too too big, but he is my friend even if he is looking too ugly. 
Strika throws his arm around Agu, protecting him. 
EXT. NATIONAL HIGHWAY JUNCTION - DAY 
The convoy has stopped in the middle of the country side. Everybody is prepping themselves for battle. 
The NDF Soldiers smoke their joints laced with powder, others sniff brown-brown, while loading up ammunition and prepping for combat. 
COMMANDANT (O.S.) No one in the land we are going is your friend. They are the farmers who feed your enemy. 
EXT. SALT FLATS - DAY 
Agu kneels down looking for ammunition, drugs, he finds a foil filled with cocaine. 
A shallow river where Government Soldiers are SHOT DOWN in retreat behind Agu. The husk of a helicopter half submerged on the river's edge. 
Agu looks up at the sun... 
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
The sun becomes the dirty glass light shade of a ceiling light. TWO LIZARDS face off inside of it. Agu's head tilts up, powder around his nose, he looks around, unsure how he got there. 
Strika beckons him to follow into 
EXT. JAH KINGDOM-LIKE DEN - NIGHT 
Lit only by candle light, Agu's boy unit and other soldiers do more drugs, a dead PLF Soldier is propped up between Hope and Griot, they place a joint in its mouth. 
Agu walks through another room where money and loot is being counted, the MEN look at the drugged out Agu, only briefly. 
Agu notices THREE BOYS crying. 
AGU What is wrong with them? 
EXT. FORTIFIED HOUSE STREET - DAY 
Agu sits over the corpse of an NRC Soldier. He looks around, as if surprised that it is daylight. 
Hope is speaking to him, but when words come out of Hope's mouth, they sound like a garbled language. 
Agu looks up at him blankly as he takes a hit from the joint. 
Now he is surrounded by SEVERAL of his BOY UNIT soldiers who stare and laugh at Agu sitting on the dead soldier. 
He looks at the group of YOUNG BOY SOLDIERS crying. 
AGU What is wrong with them? Why are they crying? 
PREACHER Commandant won't let them go with him into battle. 
AGU Where is this battle? 
He looks at Strika who shrugs his shoulders. Agu calls the crying BOYS over to him and leads them down the street.. 
EXT. FORTIFIED HOME - DAY 
Agu walks down the street with the CRYING BOYS just as his SBU blows up the gates of a fortified house. 
BOOM. The gates go down in a shower of explosives. Agu and the rest storm in. 
INT. FORTIFIED HOME 
Agu and Strika run upstairs, scavenging, breaking, scattering, tipping... 
There are pictures on the wall. Family, smiling faces, long mildewed. 
Hope is knocking down a door. KPWAM! KPWAM! 
Agu and Strika join in, kicking, kicking, kicking. They break through. 
INT. FORTIFIED HOME - BROKEN ROOM 
Agu looks down and sees the sky as the rest of the Boy Unit enters the house. 
AGU (V.O.) God, there is nothing to be keeping you from watching what we are doing. 
The VOICES laugh, the world shakes. 
They flip open an armoire. A quiet settles over the room as Hope and Griot take a moment to look at what they have found. 
A WOMAN, late-twenties, and her 10 year-old DAUGHTER hide with their backs to the men. 
The woman looks like it could be an emaciated version of Agu's Mother, she even has THE SAME DRESS AS HIS MOTHER. 
Agu looks at them, his eyes, so high, seem to float on his shoulders. 
AGU Mother? 
Hope looks at Agu, amused. Agu moves to hug her. 
AGU (CONT'D) I am not recognizing you. 
COMMANDANT No. 
The CSO and the rest of Commandant's entourage voice approval. 
PREACHER Pardon me, sah. 
Somehow, Chicken Legs has died, they drag the body to Commandant. 
COMMANDANT What is happening to this one? 
TWO-I-C A piece of his own RPG is hitting his temple. 
Commandant closes the soldier's eyes with his fingers tenderly. 
Agu and Strika watch the odd moment of sentimentality, but in both of their eyes, there is none. 
PREACHER What do we do with them? 
COMMANDANT Leave one living. Tell him to run north, to the next village, and to the next village after that, tell him to tell everyone that soon we come. This is just the beginning. 
Two-I-C digests the orders. Preacher salutes, turns and walks towards the CIVILIANS. 
EXT. LOWER COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK 
The NDF Convoy snakes through the wilderness in the last glow of skylight. 
INT/EXT. COMMANDANT'S PICK-UP TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT 
Agu watches the passing pavement under the warm beams of headlights, grass and shrubs falling off into darkness. 
INT/EXT. COMMANDANT'S PICK-UP TRUCK (MOVING) - DAY 
The convoy crests a hill and descends down a rusting grand boulevard. A burned out caravan of Bush Taxis rusts on the side of the road. 
We pan as it passes a colonial era sign on the highway "WELCOME TO TARO, THE TOWN OF ABUNDANT RESOURCES". 
ANGLE through the windshield at the passing town sign. 
Agu looks up at Commandant. Commandant notices him looking at him, he smiles. 
COMMANDANT Home, Agu. 
EXT. T.A.R. - NDF CHECK POINT - DAY 
They approach an improvised check point guarded by SOLDIERS who look much like our NDF Soldiers from a distance. Rusted and shot up cars line the road side, as if pitched gun battles had taken place here long before. 
The convoy stops a 100 hundred meters before it as THREE HEAVILY ARMED MEN approach them from the sides of the road, ready to fire. 
They wear the same amulets and pieces of equipment as the NDF but their clothes are covered in a CHARCOAL rub and OIL dipped materials: the CHARCOAL FACTION of the NDF. 
CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER Halt!   Enemy or friend?! 
PREACHER Friend! 
CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER Drop your arms to be recognized! 
PREACHER We are NDF. (code exchanged) 
CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER Who is your Commander? 
COMMANDANT I am. 
Commandant steps out of his vehicle, walking to the front, immediately protected by his entourage. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) What kind of welcome is this, enh, for a hero battalion? 
CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER I am not having instructions to be receiving you. I will radio HQ. Hold ground. 
The Charcoal NDF Soldier steps to the side with his VHF RADIO. He speaks inaudibly into it, looking back at the convoy, then receives instructions. 
He sends another CHARCOAL NDF -- PRINCE, who JUMPS ONTO THE SIDE of Preacher's truck, waiving for the convoy to follow. 
CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIER (CONT'D) I have instructions to take you to HQ immediately. The Supreme Commander, he is awaiting you. 
They pull through the convoy. About 30 CHARCOAL NDF SOLDIERS watch them go by curiously. 
Commandant, suspicious but willing to let this pass, waves his battalion off to the side of the road. 
INT./EXT. T.A.R. MAIN BOULEVARD - DAY 
WIDE ANGLE OVER TARO. Commandant's truck moves into town. 
INT. SUPREME COMMANDER HQ - ANOTHER WAITING ROOM - LATER 
They are all sleeping. 
DEPUTY Commandant. 
They stir. 
DEPUTY (CONT'D) The Supreme Commander felt ill and has gone home for the evening. 
The Deputy can see this will not satisfy Commandant, who looks like he could squeeze the life out of this functionary. 
DEPUTY (CONT'D) But he invites you to his home first appointment in the morning. 
COMMANDANT Where are you putting us to be sleeping? 
DEPUTY I hope this room, with the air conditioning, will be sufficient. Thank you, Gentlemen. 
INT. SUPREME COMMANDER'S HQ - HALLWAY - DAY 
They walk down a pleasant hallway, as if they were on a museum tour, Strika and Agu are dazzled by the cleanliness of it all. 
DEPUTY Commandant, I trust you rested well. I would like you to know we also offered rations and water to the rest of your Battalion this morning. 
Commandant walks past him. 
TWO-I-C Thank you, Deputy. 
INT. SUPREME COMMANDER'S OFFICE - DAY 
They spill out into a foyer flanked by a dining room and an office with chairs arranged for long, circuitous conversations. 
Commandant takes a seat, the rest of the entourage hold back uncomfortably, along the edge of the room. 
The Deputy enters a door on the opposite side of the room where UHF radio chatter links Goodblood to his commanders and fighters across the country. There, an elder statesman like intellectual appears in the doorway, DADA GOODBLOOD, followed by the deputy. 
EVERYONE stands and salutes. Agu strains to finally see the man they have all spoken about. He wears a fine combination of clothes, and looks smart, even in his morning slippers, newspaper in hand, Deputy holds his coffee. He sits on the smaller chair, near to Commandant. 
GOODBLOOD At ease Gentlemen. At ease... 
Goodblood smiles warmly as he sits. 
GOODBLOOD (CONT'D) Commandant. 
COMMANDANT Supreme Commander, sah. 
GOODBLOOD I must apologize for yesterday, so much busy-ness these days, it's worn me down. 
Commandant doesn't hide his frustration. 
COMMANDANT I'm sorry you were feeling weak, sah. 
GOODBLOOD I see your family has grown. 
He looks at the entourage watching them, in particular the boys. 
GOODBLOOD (CONT'D) They will want to eat while we talk. Unless you are hungry, too? 
Goodblood looks at Deputy, who quickly realizes he must usher the men to the adjoining room that offers Commandant and Goodblood more privacy. 
COMMANDANT I am hungry. Two-I-C, bring me a plate. 
Two-I-C starts to move- 
GOODBLOOD Two-I-C, you stay. Deputy? 
The Deputy nods dutifully. 
In the dining room a table of European style food is quickly sacked by the men. Strika and Agu stuff croissants into their pockets and sit on the floor, rolling slices of meat and stuffing them in their mouths. 
Agu keeps one eye on the meeting, where the Commandant and Goodblood share weighted stares. Goodblood reading Commandant's emotional weariness, Commandant reading Goodblood's ill intentions. Two-I-C is paralyzed between them. 
COMMANDANT What is this, Chief? Why are you making me wait? 
GOODBLOOD It is your duty. 
COMMANDANT Something has changed, what is it? 
He sniffs out Goodblood. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) We are not taking the Capital? 
EXT. WHOREHOUSE, DOOR - NIGHT 
Commandant and his men stand outside a sealed door. 
A dwarf like Old Woman SLIDES the window open. 
INT. WHOREHOUSE - NIGHT 
A small room. A fluorescent light casting a blue glow over everything. The men's faces shine with sweat. All of the windows and doorways have heavy black material blocking any light from escaping. 
The men fill up the room. Agu looks up, he cannot believe what he sees. 
AGU (V.O.) Imagination TV. 
On the screen is a bootleg Jimmy Cliff film. 
A HEAVY WOMAN, THE MADAME, approaches them, her eyes shine with bright blue contacts, her body is curvaceous and she walks with a limp. 
MADAME Enh, so you come? 
COMMANDANT Ma. Bring something that will satisfy my soldiers and my soldier! 
The men laugh nervously, all still reeling. Commandant's ease in conflict with what he just received from Goodblood. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Bring beer! Bring soda! Bring it all! 
The men laugh forcefully, glancing down the empty hall eagerly. Agu notices a GIRL, young and pretty, sleeping on a bench at the exit to the room. The Madame shouts at her... 
MADAME Get up you, can't you see we are having guest? 
The young girl gets up slowly and goes to a cooler. She bends over, all of the men lean to get a better view. 
YOUNG GIRL The beer is warm. 
COMMANDANT How is it warm? 
YOUNG GIRL No ice. 
COMMANDANT No ice!? 
YOUNG GIRL No light. 
COMMANDANT Bring the drink. We will be drinking it even if it is warm. 
She sighs and fills a bucket with warm beer bottles. 
TWO-I-C Commandant. Permission to be dismissed. I want to be going to be checking on my men- 
Commandant turns from smiling to deathly serious. 
COMMANDANT Negative. You'll be staying here so we can celebrate you. In fact, Mama, why don't you bring a special one for my Two-I-C, who will soon be the Co-mman-dan-tttt. (TO OTHERS) Who's your Commandant? 
TRIPOD You, sir! 
The Commandant's smile returns. He turns to the Madame. 
COMMANDANT But you have one special for Two-I- C? 
The Madame laughs. 
MADAME No problem. No problem. 
The Commandant becomes serious again, his eyes seem to communicate something coded. The Madame's tone changes. 
MADAME (CONT'D) No problem. 
COMMANDANT Hey Mama, this one's fresh papaya. 
The men laugh harder. She is annoyed, but not unaccustomed. Agu can tell now she is even younger than he thought she was, barely 14. 
MADAME If it is woman you are wanting, leave this one. I am having plenty womens in the back if you are having plenty moneys to be giving me, for a special girl. 
COMMANDANT Don't you be worrying about money, ma. Bring me a good girl, you know my specifications. 
AGU Auntie! Auntie, bring us some chips! 
The Madame turns towards him, sighing through her teeth. 
MADAME This small thing borned yesterday trying to order things around, enh! 
She goes and grabs a basket of crisps and places it in front of Agu as FOUR WOMEN appear in the doorway. 
Approaching Two-I-C, thinking he is dead. Two-I-C's eyes are open and he's trying to whisper something. Agu cannot hear it. He leans in closer. Two-I-C's breaths a death rattle. 
TWO-I-C You are just a boy. 
Agu looks at his hand, clammy and yellow, fingers gripping his blanket. 
TWO-I-C (CONT'D) Do you know you are just a boy? 
Two-I-C begins to tremble, panic. Agu reaches for his hand, holds it. 
TWO-I-C (CONT'D) Was this all for nothing? 
He looks at Two-I-C, unsure why he is feeling sad for this man at this moment. 
AGU (V.O.) It is like God is turning his gaze on Two-I-C. 
Two-I-C exhales, the trembling ceases. He is dead. Agu, drawn by the fading light, walks to the balcony overlooking the town. 
COMMANDANT Agu? Is that you. 
Agu can barely perceive Commandant sitting in the railing, his skin reflecting the faint embers of a joint cupped in his hands. Agu does not respond. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) Agu. Come. Sit down with me. 
Agu leans into the railing. Commandant rubs the back of his neck. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) It is dangerous times now, Agu. Can't be trusting nobody. That is why it is always good to be sleeping with one eye open. And that is why I have you and Strika. 
Tripod enters with RADIO OPERATOR. 
TRIPOD Goodblood is asking for you. 
Commandant waves him away. Tripod, aware things have changed, waits an explanation. 
COMMANDANT Sometimes Agu, sometimes I am feeling sorry for you. 
Agu cannot tell if he heard him say it or if he dreamed he said it. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Sometimes I am. 
AGU Two-I-C is dead. 
EXT. UNFINISHED BUILDING - NIGHT 
Preacher SINGS over Two-I-C's body. They strip him of his "Two-I-C" jacket, his belt, boots, and anything else of use. He is left with only his dirty socks and underwear. 
AGU (V.O.) It is taking Two-I-C all day to be dying, and then he is dying when the moon is full and the night is shining like silver. 
COMMANDANT You are my new Two-I-C. 
Commandant places the jacket on Tripod, who proudly puts it on over his bare chest. 
AGU (V.O.) The the only way not to be fighting anymore is to be dying. 
COMMANDANT This was not God's work. This was man's. The Supreme Commander was our friend. Now he is our enemy. But we are not fearing change... for we are strong! 
MEN Strong and proud! 
COMMANDANT That is why we should be taking our own territory and filling our own pockets. Move out. 
The NDF Soldiers take stock in what they have, burn their vehicles and move out. 
EXT. JUNGLE CAMP - NIGHT 
Fog swirls along the canopy of the jungle. Commandant's tent has been reduced to a small lean to, separate from where everyone else sleeps under the trees. 
AGU (V.O.) Mother. If this war is ever ending I am thinking, I cannot be going back to doing child thing. 
Everyone sleeps. Suddenly they are attacked from unseen forces. Bullets pound the ground around them, burying men in dirt and tearing others up with shrapnel. 
AGU (V.O.) We are just wild animals now with no place to be going. 
Agu and Strika hold each other while bullet shells pour on them. The battle is over as quickly as it began. 
Commandant is frazzled. He picks up his hat, dusting it off, while yelling for the men to fall back. 
Preacher moves up and down the line, checking the men. 
PREACHER Tripod, Hope! 
Agu looks down the line. They are both bleeding. Hope is dead. Tripod still breathes, but his body is leaking blood from many wounds. He screams while staring wildly at everyone looking down at him, breathing. 
EXT. MUDDY RED TRENCH - MORNING 
Agu stands alone in knee deep water peeing into the same. He notices a floating corpse next to where he is peeing, its BOOTS looking in decent condition. 
He stops peeing and pries the boots off, falling back into the water. 
When he gets up he notices the GIRL from the whorehouse, now fully pregnant trying to climb out of the trench to escape. 
His first instinct is to grab his rifle and aim. She sees this, they lock eyes, but she tests him, stepping higher. He lowers his aim. 
She thanks him with her eyes, but doesn't make it more than 15 feet before SWOOFFF, a bullet from a SNIPER far off on the other side of a BURNED FIELD drops her - the MEN the trench Agu is hiding in was built to hide from. 
Agu, only briefly saddened by the quick end to the girl, goes back to prying off the dead man's boot. 
EXT. MUDDY RED TRENCH - DAY 
The rain mists on Agu, newish boots hanging on his shoulders from their laces. The MOTHER'S SONG sings again from some place off in the mist. 
AGU (V.O.) Mother, your song is making my body to move and I am not having to think anymore, not about Strika, not about this war, not about any of the thing that are jumping into my head. 
He sits in a fox hole overlooking the burnt field. PREACHER tries to take a pop shot at someone on the other side of the field. 
PREACHER Ammo. Find me some fucking bullets to be shooting, Agu. 
AGU He is dead. 
PREACHER Who is dead? 
AGU Him. 
Agu points to the man he pried the boots from. Bored, he goes to find ammo, digging through abandoned rifles and dead bodies. 
AGU (V.O.) I want to be going to that person who is singing and taking all of the sound so I can be keeping it in my pocket, to be having it for myself. 
The trench is filled with more water. Agu walks through it towards the inner part of the NDF defenses, the water up to his belly so he rests his rifle on his head. 
AGU (V.O.) I am wanting to lie down on the warm ground with my eye closed and the smell of mud in my nose, just like Strika. 
Agu looks at his reflection in the water staring back at him. He moves, it moves. He walks, it follows. Around him, the men have created smaller mini-indentations to protect themselves from the rain of shrapnel. 
AGU (V.O.) I am wanting to feel how the ground is wet all around my body so that if I am sweating, I am feeling like it is the ground sweating through me. 
NDF Soldiers are like ghosts in the heavy mist. He cannot see more than a couple feet in front of him at a time. 
AGU (V.O.) And I am wanting to stay in this same place forever, never moving for anything, just waiting waiting until dust is piling on me and grasses is covering me and insect is making their home in the space between my teeths. 
He rounds an intersection in the trench with a wooden defense protecting it from exposure, leading deeper into the woods. 
AGU (V.O.) One onina tree will be growing from my body, so wide that its trunk is separating night and day and so tall that its top leaf is tickling the moon until the man living there is smiling. 
EXT. COMMMANDANT'S GOLD MINE - DAY 
Agu enters the gold mining area of their encampment. He sits to put on his new boots while looking at the lackluster industry. 
Commandant sits on a throne of earth, a purple rappa covering him from the rain like a tribal king. He stares at the sky, a joint hanging gingerly in his dirty fingers, ash floating on the water all around him. 
AGU Commandant, suh. We are out of bullets. 
COMMANDANT Kai! This fog, Agu. It is our friend. 
Agu nods, dutifully. Commandant relights the joint. 
He motions for Agu to come over to him. Agu does, slowly, trudging through the shallower water. Commandant puts his arm on him, gently caressing his back. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) It was not supposed to be the way it has come to be, Agu. 
AGU They are dead. 
COMMANDANT Who are dead? 
Agu doesn't seem to know how to answer the question. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) EVERYONE- 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Everyone betrays you, eventually. But, I will always look out for you, Agu. I will look out for you because you are my son. 
Out of the mist, Agu hears voices, restless voices. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) And a son always protects his father. 
Agu pulls away from Commandant and trudges towards the entrance to let Preacher through. 
As they pass a line of former ECOMOD TROOPS now re-organized as UN forces, Agu notices the 2nd Lieutenant from his home village, Alpha Town, the man he sold his imagination TV to, but the man does not recognize Agu. 
As Agu stares at him, the 2nd Lieutenant is forced to make eye contact with him, but can't make out why this young fighter is staring at him. 
FADE TO WHITE: 
AGU (V.O.) In heaven, it is always morning. 
FADE IN: 
INT. ROOM - DAY 
A ceiling fan spins around in circles. Agu stares at it while laying in a clean bed of white sheets. 
He is healthy. His skin fresh, his face filled in. His eyes clear. 
Outside, children scream -- with joy. 
Agu sits up. Child-like drawings of war flutter on a desk under the ventilation of the fan. He steps out of bed and stares out the window. 
Permanent wooden blinds split his view horizontally, but he can see through them, at DOZENS of children running into the turquoise waters of the ocean. 
AGU (V.O.) I am not knowing how long I am staying here, but I am staying here for a long time -- some week, some month -- I am not knowing. All I am knowing is how it is feeling here. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Agu stares at the other children at play. 
He notices a miniature crab running sideways in the sand, making a tiny trail. 
He looks back at the kids playing by the ocean. 
INT. CAFETERIA - DAY 
A young WOMAN, AMY (20s) watches Agu. He doesn't join the other children, he stays separate. 
AGU (V.O.) Sometimes I am eating even if I am not hungrying too much because I am fearing that the food is finishing for the next day. 
INT. AGU'S ROOM - DAY 
Agu dresses in new clothes, stares into a mirror at himself. 
AGU (V.O.) I am liking the clothes is clean and dry and it is not having any hole from bullet or blood from the last person who is wearing it. 
EXT. SHELTER COURTYARD - DAY 
The children scream as FATHER FRIDAY, (50s) enters the compound in a Land Rover. They swarm him. 
INT. SCHOOL ROOM - DAY 
Father Friday sits in front of Agu. 
FATHER FRIDAY Turn to God. Confession and Forgiveness and Resurrection, these are the things you need to know to bring the life back to your life... 
He continues while Agu listens. 
AGU (V.O.) I am not knowing all what he is meaning. The only thing that is making sense to me is memory that I am having of another boy -- Strika - - sleeping next to me, so close because we are the only people protecting each other from all of the thing trying to kill us. 
FLASH CUT TO: 
EXT. JUNGLE CAMP - NIGHT 
Agu and Strika holding on to each other. 
INT. SCHOOL ROOM - DAY 
Agu sits defensively in front of the Father. 
AGU (V.O.) The only thing I am knowing is the sound of people coughing and screaming, and the smell of going to toilet and dead body. And the feeling of the brown brown and djamba in my blood. 
INT. ROOM - NIGHT (FORMERLY SC. 150) 
The same dorm room, several weeks earlier. 
Agu sweats in bed, his body aching as the drugs and poisons leave his system. He shakes in bed. 
INT. SHELTER KITCHEN - DAY 
The kids, including Agu, raid the kitchen threatening the COOKS, they lock them inside the kitchen and take over the school. 
INT. SHELTER COURTYARD - DAY (FORMERLY SC. 159)

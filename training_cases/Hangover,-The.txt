THE HANGOVER

EXT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB -- PACIFIC PALISADES, CA -- MORNING 
It's a beautiful spring morning in the Palisades. High atop the cliffs, looking out over the Pacific Ocean, sits the exclusive BEL AIR BAY CLUB. Workers bustle about the lawn, setting up a high-end wedding. A STRING QUARTET warms up. A team of FLORISTS arrange centerpieces. CATERERS set the white linen tables... 
INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY 
A simple, classic wedding dress hangs on a closet door in this sun-drenched bridal suite. Sitting at the makeup table, surrounded by her bridesmaids, is the beautiful bride, TRACY TURNER, 20's. She's busy doing her makeup. Just then, Tracy's rich, stern FATHER, 50's, blows in. 
MR. TURNER Any word from Doug? The way he spits out "Doug" tells us all we need to know about how Mr. Turner feels about his future son-in-law. 
TRACY No, but I'm sure he's-- Just then, Tracy's CELLPHONE rings. She quickly answers it. 
TRACY (CONT'D) Hello? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- MORNING 
Heat-waves rise off the Mojave. Standing at a lone, dust- covered payphone in the middle of the desert is 
VICK LENNON He's in his late 20's, tall, rugged -- and currently a mess. His shirt is ripped open, his aviator sunglasses are bent, his lip is bloodied, and he clearly hasn't slept in days. 
VICK Tracy, it's Vick. Parked on the dirt road behind Vick is his near-totalled 1967 Cadillac Deville convertible; it's scratched, dented, filthy - - and missing its passenger side door. Slouched inside are TWO OTHER GUYS, also looking like hell. 
TRACY Hey Vick! 
VICK Listen, honey...The bachelor party got a little out of control and, well...we lost Doug. 
TRACY (her jaw dropping) What?! But we're getting married in like four hours! Vick squints at the rising sun. 
VICK Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

TITLE OVER BLACK: 40 HOURS EARLIER 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE 10 FREEWAY -- DAY 
The top down, The Who's "Baba O'Riley" blasting from the stereo, Vick's pristine Cadillac convertible rockets down Highway 10 towards Nevada. At the wheel is Vick, looking as sharp as his Caddy in a half- open shirt and mint condition aviators. Sitting shotgun is the groom, DOUG BILLINGS, late 20's, handsome, barefoot, crunchy -- an all around great guy. Behind Vick sits ALAN MERVISH, late 20's, an anal tax attorney from Connecticut, his Izod shirt tucked into his khakis. He's currently applying sun screen to his forehead. Next to Alan is STU PRYCE, late 20's, former high school linebacker and lovably dimwitted father of two. He drums the back of the frontseat to the music, totally pumped, like this is his first time out of the house in years. Because it is. 
STU Dude this is already the best weekend ever! 
VICK Stu, relax, we're still on the 10. 
STU Oh, did I show you pictures of my kids?! 
DOUG No, dude, show `em. Stu fishes pictures out of his wallet and eagerly shows them to Doug in the front seat. Doug is clearly the core of this group, the glue that holds these childhood friends together. 
STU Haylee is two, and Kaitlin is already four! Can you believe it?! 
DOUG (smiling at photos) How cute... Good for you, man. Doug shows the photos to Vick; he nods, impressed. 
VICK The one on the left is gonna be a hottie. The other one, not so much. Stu protectively snatches the photos back, muttering: 
STU Jesus, dude, those are my children-- 
ALAN (re: sunscreen) Hey, am I rubbed in? Stu glances over and sees un-rubbed-in sunscreen all over Alan's face. 
ALAN & DOUG & VICK 
YES! Doug laughs and raises his glass for a toast, heartfelt: 
DOUG Little toast: to Tracy, the coolest, kindest, most beautiful woman I've ever met. I can't believe she let me come this weekend -- much less agreed to spend the rest of her life with me. I think both will prove to be massive errors of judgement on her part. The guys chuckle, hear-hear. 
DOUG (CONT'D) And to being here, with my best friends in the world. There's nowhere else I'd rather be. The guys raise their glasses, touched. 
DOUG (CONT'D) That said, let's not get too stupid tonight, okay? I'm getting married in 36 hours. 
ALAN & STU & VICK No, no. / We'll be good. / Totally, dude. Doug lowers his glass, laughing, completely unconvinced. 
DOUG I'm serious, dudes! Nothing above the neck -- no piercings, no weird haircuts, no facial tattoos. I gotta look decent on Sunday. 
VICK Jesus, what do you take us for? 
DOUG Vick: you shaved Alan's eyebrows off the night before graduation! 
STU Oh yeah! That was hilarious! And remember when I blacked out at Homecoming and you wrote on my face with permanent marker?! That was awesome! What'd you write again? 
ALAN & DOUG & VICK "Respect me!" They all laugh. Stu throws his arm around Doug, nostalgic. 
STU Ahh, good times, man. Good times... 
VICK We'll be good tonight, Doug. 
ALAN Seriously, man, we're your friends. 
STU Yeah, we've totally grown up since then. Doug looks at them, highly dubious, then hoists his glass. 
DOUG Well then...to a night we'll never forget. They CLINK glasses, shoot their shots, and 
SMASH CUT TO: 
THE NEXT MORNING Shafts of white desert sunlight pour into 
THE DEAN MARTIN SUITE THE CAMERA follows a LIVE CHICKEN as it walks through the totalled suite. Furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans, platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the Gideon Bible, half-eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc. SNORING on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe, the word ASSHOLE written in Sharpie across his chest, is Stu. 
TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 11:15AM" The chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it reaches a plastic coin cup from Bellagio blocking its path. Beat. Then the chicken pecks it off...onto Stu. The cup hits Stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all over him. Stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the couch, onto a pile of newspapers. 
PILE OF NEWSPAPERS OWW! Get off! Get off! Jesus! Confused, Stu clambers off the pile of newspapers -- to find Vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. Vick pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain. 
VICK Damn, dude, why are you retarded? Both men are ragingly hungover. A long beat as both of them rub their faces, then: 
VICK (CONT'D) Um, Stuey? 
STU Yo. 
VICK Why do you have a mullet? Stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. But he's too hungover to understand. 
STU What? 
VICK You know, business on top, party down the back? Stu still looks confused. This is excruciating for Vick. 
VICK (CONT'D) Your hair, dude. You have a mullet. Stu touches his hair. Then he stumbles into the bathroom. After a beat, we hear his voice: 
STU (O.S.) Dude...I have a mullet. Then we hear ALAN'S VOICE in the bathroom, groggy: 
ALAN (O.S.) Just give me ten more minutes, Beck... 
STU (O.S.) Whoa, did you sleep in the tub? Beat, then Stu pokes his head out of the bathroom. 
STU (CONT'D) Check it out: Alan slept in the tub. 
VICK Get him up. I'm hungry. Stu disappears back into the bathroom. We hear the SHOWER turn on. Beat. Then we hear Alan slowly awaken: 
ALAN (O.S.) Wet. Water. Jesus, what's--?! There's a THUD as Alan falls out of tub. Beat. Then Stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet Alan stumble out of the bathroom. Alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night before. Only, as we PULL BACK, we see that his shirt is cut off at his chest -- he's naked from there down. 
ALAN What an asshole. Stu, check the pool and the casino, I'll check the room and the gym. Maybe he's working out or something... Stu nods, and they slowly slide out of the booth. 
ALAN (CONT'D) And Vick, if you could keep a close eye on the buffet, that'd be really helpful. Thanks, man. Alan and Stu saunter off. Vick yells after them, mouth full: 
VICK 
HE'S FIME! YOU'RE OBERWEACTING! 
Vick scowls, and angrily takes Alan's last cruller. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Alan weaves through the totalled suite, half-awake. 
ALAN Doug...? Doug...? Wake up, man. Alan enters the bedroom where Doug slept, and stops. It takes him a second to realize what's wrong: 
THE BED IS MISSING There are four indentations on the carpet where it once lay. Alan scratches his head. 
ALAN That's weird... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- POOL -- DAY 
Stu, walking bow-legged, squinting painfully in the bright sun, tries to inspect everyone lying around the huge pool. Doug? Doug? Several HOT WOMEN in bikinis sit up, disgusted! 
STU No, no. It's cool, I'm a dad. It's totally cool... 
CUT TO: 
INT. GYM -- DAY 
Alan stumbles through the gym, looking for Doug. The place is packed with fit people, working out. Alan mumbles to himself: 
ALAN I hate you all... 
CUT TO: 
INT. CASINO FLOOR -- NICKEL SLOTS 
Stu wanders through the casino, calling out, incredibly loud: 
STU 
DOUG! DOUG! Two GAY MEN in identical tank tops pass by, holding hands. 
GAY MAN Hey Stu. 
STU Hey guys. DOUG! DOUG--! Then Stu registers what just happened. He stops and turns around -- enh? -- but the gay men are gone. Before he can comment, however, he sees Vick and Alan talking to Atashir at 
THE RECEPTION DESK He slowly bow-legs himself over. 
STU You find Doug? 
ALAN No, I assume you didn't either? Stu shakes his head, no. Then Atashir hangs up his phone. 
ATASHIR There is no Doug Billings at any of the area hospitals, morgues, or police stations. The guys frown, starting to grow worried. 
STU Maybe he went for a jog? 
ALAN Dude. It's 120 degrees outside. 
STU Or shopping? The guys just look at him like: you're an idiot. 
ALAN Great. So we've officially lost Doug. His wedding is in what, 22 hours? 
ALAN Jesus, what is it? 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Vick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans. 
VICK I can't believe we're doing this. 
STU You don't have to look up my butt, just at it. Something is terribly, terribly wrong... Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes. 
He's wearing a snug FLUORESCENT PINK G-STRING with "I ROGER" written vertically down the front. In glitter. 
ALAN Sweet mother of mercy... 
VICK Who's Roger? 
STU I-I-I don't know?! What do you think it means?! 
VICK What do I think it means? Well, Stuart, your ass is all torn up and you're wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude -- I don't think we need the CSI team for this one! You got reamed last night, man! Stu covers his mouth, horrified! 
ALAN I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this... 
STU Really?! What?! Alan tries to think of one. 
ALAN Yeah, maybe there isn't. 
VICK Look, I'm sure Roger is a very nice, considerate young man-- 
STU Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?! 
VICK Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near cool enough. 
STU (gasping, realizing) I do watch Dancing With The Stars with the kids! 
ALAN Oh god, that doesn't mean you're gay. 
VICK But sort of...it does? Stu grows increasingly frantic. 
STU And once, I caught myself gazing at a topless photo of David Beckham! 
ALAN So what, he's a great-looking dude-- 
STU And then I had those weird feelings for Vick that time in middle school, remember?! Everyone stops. Vick most of all. 
VICK Um, what? 
STU Yeah, that weekend we were all camping -- I told you this. 
VICK Yeah, no you didn't. 
STU I didn't? 
VICK I think I'd remember, dude. 
ALAN Yeah, I think we'd all remember. 
STU Yeah. I had weird feelings for you that weekend. Like really hot, really gay feelings. But then they went away. Vick is just looking at him, stunned. 
ALAN Wait -- I was there that weekend. Did you have gay feelings for me? 
VICK Unbelievable. 
ALAN What?! I was a good-looking kid! 
VICK Please, you're so not his type! 
ALAN (CONT'D) Oh, hey Becky! Hi! He steps away to take the call. Vick explains to Carla: 
VICK That's his girlfriend of 14 years. I'm sure this'll only take a minute... 
Vick and Stu go back to looking at the wedding photos as Alan tries to talk to his furious girlfriend. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
BECKY in her Laura Ashley bedroom, angrily packing up her suitcase. She's beautiful and preppy in pearls and a sweater set. 
BECKY Can you tell me why all the goddamn credit cards are maxed out?! 
ALAN No! I-I have no idea--! Then Vick calls over from the white plastic table, pissed: 
VICK 
HEY ALAN, HOW COME I WASN'T YOUR 
BEST MAN, DUDE! 
STU 
YEAH, WHAT THE HELL, ME EITHER! 
WHY'D YOU PICK DOUG?! Alan waves at them, shut the hell up! But Becky has heard. 
BECKY "Your best man?!" What's going on there, Alan?! 
ALAN Nothing! Baby, nothing, the GUYS 
ARE JUST BEING DICKS! 
VICK 
HEY ALAN, YOU WANT ALL YOUR WALLET- 
SIZED WEDDING PHOTOS, OR CAN I 
BOGART A FEW?! Alan furiously flips them off, shut up! 
BECKY I really don't appreciate being mocked right now, Alan, especially about wedding-related issues. You know how hard this weekend is going to be for me. 
ALAN I know, baby! I know-- 
BECKY So you'll call the credit card company and straighten this out? 
ALAN Yes. I will. I promise. 
BECKY Okay. Okay... (beat, calming) Look, sorry I'm so tense... I'll see you soon, okay? Love you. But Alan is just staring at the BRONZE SHIELD of him making out with his blonde bombshell wife... 
BECKY (CONT'D) Alan? Hello? I said I love you?! 
ALAN Yes, no, I love you too! Becky hangs up, rolling her eyes, unbelievable. STAY WITH ALAN as he closes his cellphone. Exhales. 
STU Hey, how's Becky doing, man?! 
VICK Yeah, did she ask about us?! Off of Alan's hate-filled glare, we 
CUT TO: 
STEVE AND THE GUYS SCHLEPPING ALL OF THE WEDDING CRAP through the strip mall parking lot, back to their car. Alan sullenly carries the GIANT BRONZE SHIELD. 
STU Look on the bright side, Alan. Vick found a great clue. 
VICK Turns out Doug was in all the wedding photos, which means -- if the time stamp was right -- we had him in our possession until 11 pm. 
STU That's another hour of last night that we can account for. Isn't that great? 
KALOLO FANALUA We're from Guam, bitch! Now get outta the car! 
VICK Okay, okay! Cool it with the bat! Jesus, why is everyone trying to kill my car...? Vick undoes his seatbelt   and reaches for his door handle. Kikiolani lowers his bat   -- and Vick throws the door open, right into his nuts! The   huge Samoan staggers back, OWWW, and Vick slams his door shut   and 
FLOORS IT OUT OF THERE IN REVERSE! The Caddy sideswipes a car, hops the curb, and lands on the street! They SQUEAL AWAY, the huge bronze shield flying out of the backseat as they do! It CLATTERS on the pavement... 
EXT. EAST VEGAS STREET -- CONTINUOUS 
Vick drives like the wind, trying to see around the huge SPIDERWEB in the windshield. Alan and Stu are freaking out. 
ALAN Why'd you do that?! 
VICK 
(INCREDULOUS) Really? 
STU Maybe they just wanted to talk! 
VICK I honestly don't know how you two are still alive. 
ALAN Do you think we stole something from them last night?! 
STU Oh my god I am such a bad dad! 
ALAN (producing cellphone) I'm calling the police. This is getting way out of control-- 
VICK No! No cops! 
ALAN "No cops?!" Who are you, Fitty Cent?! 
STU Yeah, Vick, what's going on? 
VICK Nothing! I just think we should focus on finding Doug and not get distracted by every little thing! 
ALAN Every little thing?! We were just assaulted by the Yakuza! 
VICK Oh please, those guys are from Guam. Get a grip. 
ALAN They knew your name, Vick! Which means they probably know who Stu and I are, too! 
STU If anything ever happened to my family, Vick... 
VICK Fine. Let's just go back to the hotel -- Doug is probably back from wherever he spent the night, we'll get him, we'll straighten out whatever we did to those angry Samoans, then we'll get the hell back to LA, okay? Left turn. Vick angrily takes a harder-than-necessary left turn. Alan hangs on tight, almost flying out of the car. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: "SATURDAY, 2:26 PM" 
INT. DEAN MARTIN SUITE -- DAY 
The boys hurry into their room, stressed. 
VICK Doug? Doug? Alan quickly checks the room phone. 
ALAN No messages. 
STU Come on, let's toss the place. Alan starts wading through the crap in the living room, while Vick and Stu head off to check the bedrooms... 
INT. BEDROOM 
Stu brushes aside beer bottles and room service dishes, looking for anything relevant. He spots a LEGAL CONTRACT on the ground. Picks it up. 
STU Hey, check it out, Vick! I invested 30 grand in your custard store last night! Vick calls from the other bedroom. 
VICK (O.S.) Smart move, man. Stu opens the closet door -- and freezes. 
STU Hey, you wanna come in here a sec?! Vick enters a moment later to find Stu staring into the closet. Vick follows his gaze and sees a SEXY WOMAN snoring away on the closet floor, her blonde hair obscuring her face. 
CHASTITY Sure, we met at the bar at like 10:00? Then we got married on my smoke break, which was like 11:00? 
VICK It's the All-American love story, isn't it? What happened next? 
CHASTITY Well, I had to go back to work. But when I got off at 5:30, I met up with you guys back here. 
VICK And was Doug with us then? 
CHASTITY No. 
VICK Interesting... Do you have any idea where we went after the wedding? 
CHASTITY No, but I bet some of my work friends do. You were partying with them pretty hard. 
STU Work friends? 
SMASH CUT TO: 
STRIPPERS Dozens of `em, dancing, grinding, shimmying on poles. 
INT. CRAZY HORSE GENTLEMEN'S CLUB -- DAY 
Chastity leads the guys through Vegas's Most Notorious Strip Club, The Crazy Horse. It's bacchanalia writ large, complete with throbbing music, flashing strobe lights, and six stages of spinning flesh. The place is mobbed with PATRONS. Alan follows after Chastity, horrified. 
ALAN You work here? Behind him, Vick SLAPS FIVE with Stu, psyched. 
CHASTITY Yeah -- and this is the pole where we first met! She stops at a pole, around which a BRUNETTE STRIPPER currently spins. Alan looks ill. 
CHASTITY (CONT'D) It's always been my lucky pole... 
ALAN Look, I don't know how to tell you this, but-- 
CHASTITY 
HEY PLATINUM, CHECK IT OUT! She holds up her hand, showing off ALAN'S GRANDMOTHER'S RING to the stripper currently upside-down on the pole. 
PLATINUM THE STRIPPER Get it, girl! 
CHASTITY Come on, let's go meet my bridesmaids! 
She hurries off, but Alan can't move. 
STU Dude. 
VICK I know. 
ALAN The Holocaust, man. Alan just stares into space. Vick takes him by the shoulder. 
VICK Look, we can get your grandmother's ring back. We just gotta go about it in the right way. 
ALAN I have besmirched my people. 
STU Don't be so hard on yourself, dude-- Just then Chastity runs back over with two BLONDE STRIPPERS. 
CHASTITY These were my bridesmaids, Anastasia and Starr! 
STARR Hey, boys! Good to see you again! 
ANASTASIA Mazel Tov--! 
ALAN Please...don't. Just then a SPOTLIGHT finds Chastity and Alan, and the SLEAZY PONYTAILED DJ up in the booth comes over the P.A. system: 
STRIP CLUB D.J. 
OKAY, GUYS! LET'S GIVE A CRAZY 
HORSE SHOUT-OUT TO OUR HAPPY NEW 
STU Is it weird that we're sitting this close watching? 
VICK Not for me. More watching in silence. 
STU I really shouldn't be here. I have daughters. Then both of their heads angle the same way. 
VICK Not that can do that. 
STU How can she do that without dislocating her hip? 
VICK Because she's been touched by God. They continue staring, amazed. Just then, the door is kicked open and KIKIOLANI and KALOLO FANALUA burst into the Champagne Room, peering through the darkness, looking for our guys. Vick and Stu see them immediately. 
VICK (CONT'D) Shit. They both hop up. Alan remains sitting, however, hypnotized by Chastity. Vick grabs him. 
VICK (CONT'D) Alan, come on, man, we gotta go! 
ALAN Whoa, whoa, I'm smelling the roses-- Vick literally yanks Alan up from the banquette. 
VICK Come on, man! We got company! Finally, the Guamians spot the guys and lumber for them! 
VICK (CONT'D) Chastity, honey, is there a back way out of here?! Thinking fast, Chastity grabs her clothes and darts over to a darkened, unlabeled FIRE DOOR. 
CHASTITY Come on! The guys race after her... 
INT. CRAZY HORSE -- BACK HALLWAY 
Chastity and the guys sprint through the bright, crowded back hallways of the Crazy Horse, weaving through strippers, cocktail waitresses, and barbacks. Behind them, the two massive Samoans try to follow, but are slowed by all the foot traffic. Strippers SCREAM as they're bowled over by the obese Islanders. 
INT. CRAZY HORSE -- MAIN STAGE 
A spotlight holds on a CLOSED CURTAIN covering the main stage. Some sort of techno Limp Bizkit song is playing. 
STRIPPER D.J. (O.S.) 
ANNND ON STAGE ONE, PUT YOUR HANDS 
TOGETHER FOR...DOUBLE STAXXX! All the patrons turn their attention to Stage One -- then Stu blows through the curtain, out of breath. Beat. The patrons look at Stu, confused. Stu looks at them, equally so. The patrons start to BOOO, just as Vick, Chastity, and Alan blow through the curtain after Stu. 
CHASTITY Come on! Chastity, in six inch leucite heels, sprints down the main runway, leaps over the patrons sitting at the end, and hits the floor running! 
STU Did she just do that in heels?! 
VICK I'm really starting to like this girl. The guys all follow suit, sprinting down the runway and leaping over the patrons! Then the Guamians blow through the curtain, panting, very upset. They lumber down the stage -- and the patrons at the end of the runway clear the hell out of the way. 
CHASTITY AND THE GUYS RACE THROUGH THE STRIP CLUB Upsetting cocktails, hopping onto stages and then off again, leaping over chairs, spinning around stripper poles, and, finally, sprinting out the front door! 
The massive Guamians give chase, leaving a wide trail of destruction behind them, like two elephants trampling through a forest. Just as they're blowing out of the door, however, 
THEY'RE CLOTHESLINED BY TWO CHAIRS being swung into their chests! SMASH! They both stumble backwards, and then four roided-up STRIP CLUB SECURITY GUARDS pounce on them, wrestling them to the ground. 
CRAZY HORSE SECURITY GUARD (to walkie talkie) Viper One, this is Rolling Thunder, we've subdued the targets, over. 
EXT. CRAZY HORSE -- DAY 
Chastity and the guys hurry around the corner from the Crazy Horse, laughing, exhilarated from the chase. 
STU Did you see them trample those tiny Japanese businessmen?! I think they killed like four of them! Everyone laughs. Vick puts his arm around Alan. 
VICK Come on, Alan: tell me that wasn't just a little fun... 
ALAN That was...a little fun. Vick smiles -- just as a LAS VEGAS POLICE CAR hops the curb, lights flashing, and cuts them off! Two mustachioed COPS get out and hurry for them, pointing, intense. 
LAS VEGAS POLICEMAN Victor Lennon?! Alan Mervish?! Stuart Pryce?! 
STU 
(SCARED) Y-Yes?! 
VICK 
(UNBLINKING) Yes, Officer Merriweather. I do. 
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER If I find out you're lying to me, son, I will take all of you down, is that clear? 
OFFICER BLADEN You boys wouldn't last three hours in prison. 
VICK Stu might. Stu shakes his head, unbelievable. 
VICK (CONT'D) Now: are you gonna charge us with something, or are we free to go? The cops look at each other, scowling. Beat. 
OFFICER BLADEN Get outta here. Stu and Alan quickly hop to their feet and make for the door. 
ALAN Oh, thank you, Officers! 
STU It was really nice meeting you--! 
OFFICER MERRIWEATHER If you know what's good for you, you'll get the hell out of Vegas. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAS VEGAS POLICE STATION -- NIGHT 
Day has turned to night. Vick, Stu, and Alan descend the steps of the police station. The mood is grim. 
ALAN Did you have to be such a dick?! 
VICK We got out, didn't we? 
ALAN Yeah, four hours later! If we'd just cooperated with them-- 
VICK If we'd cooperated with them, we'd be in jail right now, Alan. They reach the curb, and Stu starts trying to hail a cab. Desperation is setting in. 
ALAN What are we gonna do now? We've got zero leads on where Doug is! 
STU Why hasn't he called? It's 8:30. The guys shake their heads, I don't know. 
STU (CONT'D) Do you think he's okay--? 
VICK Stu, don't. Doug is fine. 
STU I mean, we were hanging out with mobsters last night, man! They kill people for looking at `em weird--! 
VICK Stu: Doug is fine. 
STU Or what if we like drove Doug out to the desert and left him, just as like a funny prank--?! 
VICK Stu! Enough! 
ALAN 
(MUTTERING) I knew I shouldn't have come... 
VICK What did you just say? 
ALAN I said I knew I shouldn't have come this weekend, Vick! 
VICK (getting heated) Is that right? 
ALAN Yeah, that's right. I only came because Doug insisted. Vick steps towards Alan, heated. 
VICK Why do think you're so much better than us, dude?! 
ALAN I don't -- I just think I'm better than you, Vick! And trust me, it's not that hard! You haven't changed one bit since high school! Jesus, you're 28 years old and you still talk back to cops?! Really?! 
VICK You're out of your depth, Alan-- 
STU (torn, answers phone) Good evening, this is Stu! 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- NIGHT 
It's Tracy. She's sitting in her living room, on the phone. Her STERN FATHER sits nearby, as do other FAMILY MEMBERS. 
TRACY Stu, it's Tracy! His eyes bulging, Stu covers the phone and hisses: 
STU It's Tracy! Vick glares at Alan. Alan looks away, shit. 
STU (CONT'D) Why is she calling me?! 
VICK Because she knows you're the most easily tricked. 
ALAN We have tell her we lost Doug. 
VICK No we don't! Tell her nothing, Stu! Stu turns back to the phone, rattled. 
STU Hey, Trace! W-What's going on? 
TRACY Oh, nothing, just here with my family... 
STU Wow, that sounds amazing! 
TRACY Yeah...? Hey, you wouldn't happen to know where Doug is, would you? He said he'd be home by 5 for this dinner, and now it's almost 9:00. I tried his cell, but he didn't answer... 
STU Ummmm........Hang on. (covering the mouthpiece) She wants to know where Doug is! 
VICK I'm working on it! Buy us some time! 
ALAN No, just tell her the truth! Honesty is always the best policy! 
VICK What are you, retarded?! Honesty is never the best policy! Especially not with brides! 
STU (lamely, to phone) Um, what'd you say? 
TRACY 
(FROWNING) I asked if you knew where Doug was. 
STU Yeah, um, hang on. (to guys) She still wants to know! 
VICK Okay: tell her Alan got really drunk last night and fell down, and the doctor said not to move him for a few hours, but that we'll be back in time for the wedding. 
ALAN Why do I have to be the one that fell over drunk?! 
VICK It's a fictitious canard, Alan, get over yourself! Stu: tell her! 
STU (TO PHONE) Listen, Tracy, Alan fell on a 
DOCTOR-- 
VICK Fell over drunk. 
STU H-He was drunk. And the doctor -- a different doctor, not the one he fell on -- he said we couldn't move him until the wedding-- 
VICK For a few hours! We'll be home before the wedding! 
STU But we're going to have the wedding at your home-- Tracy just looks really confused. Exasperated, Vick rips the phone away from Stu. 
VICK Tracy?! Vick! How are ya, hon? 
TRACY (now very concerned) Vick, what is going on? 
VICK Nothing! Stu is a moron. Listen, Alan hurt his back last night, so we're gonna be laid up here for a bit, but I promise we'll have Doug home in time for the wedding, okay? 
TIGHT ON: STU'S HAND The first bar written on it is "GhostBar." 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT. GHOSTBAR -- NIGHT 
Chastity and the guys blow in, each with a photo of Doug (in medieval armor) from Alan's wedding. As they move into the club, every single waiter, bartender, and busboy sees them and throws open their arms, heyyyy, remembering them! They flash the picture of Doug to anyone who'll look -- waiters, maitre d's, thugs, bachelorettes, fetishists, bikers, swingers, brides and grooms -- but all of them shake their heads, we have no idea where Doug is... 
INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT 
Stu crosses off "GhostBar" from his arm... 
INT. BODY ENGLISH NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT 
The guys and Chastity enter and disperse. Again, everyone recognizes them and hugs them like returning heroes -- and again, no one remembers where they were taking Doug... 
INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT 
Stu crosses off another stamp from his arm... 
EXT. PURE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT 
The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line... 
INT. TAO NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT 
The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line... 
INT. ICE NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT 
The BOUNCER recognizes the guys from the night before and unclips the rope, letting them in past the immense line... 
INT. VICK'S CAR -- NIGHT 
The guys race through a shadier, more industrial area of town, their hopes dimming... 
STU All right, this is the last place we went, "Chaps." Vick rolls to a stop in front of... 
CHAPS NIGHTCLUB It takes a moment for the guys to realize that everyone in line is male, buff, and wearing erotic cowboy gear. 
STU You sure we came here...? Then they look up at the marquee. It reads "CHAPS: HOME OF 
THE GOLDEN PONY ALL MALE REVUE." 
ALAN The Golden Pony. That's us. 
STU Maybe I'll just wait in the car-- But Vick is already shoving Stu out of the car. 
INT. CHAPS NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT 
The guys walk into the massive nightclub and stop. It's got a kitschy barn theme, and hosts 200 TOPLESS DUDES in cowboy hats and short-shorts grinding on each other. 
VICK You think we would've remembered this... 
STU Yeah, I don't think we came here... 
ALAN Then why is your underwear nailed to the wall? The guys turn to see numerous pairs of MEN'S UNDERWEAR nailed to the wall nearby. A sign above it reads "CHAPS WALL OF FAME." We recognize Stu's COLORADO STATE BOXERS. 
STU Those could be anybody's. Thousands of people go to Colorado State-- 
ALAN (looking more closely) Oh my God, are they autographed? 
VICK 
(READING) "Stu Pryce, 9/30/08. I     Chaps!" 
STU (realizing, stunned) I am so gay... Just then, a BUFF WAITER in assless chaps blows by, smiling. 
ROGER I know, I'm sort of over group stuff too, but Alan insisted. Now it's Alan's turn to look stunned. 
VICK You insisted?! Why'd you insist?! 
ALAN I don't know! I don't know why I insisted! 
ROGER Actually, after the anger went away, it was really quite tender. The guys look at each other, nauseous. 
STU I'm really not sure we can be friends anymore... Finally, Chastity starts LAUGHING. 
CHASTITY Guys: he's kidding. Roger breaks into a smile and slaps five with Chastity. The guys all exhale, incredibly relieved. 
VICK Not cool, Roger. Not cool. 
ALAN So what did happen last night? 
ROGER Oh, well, you guys came in near the end of our last set, like 2ish. Doug pretty much dragged you in. 
ALAN Really? Doug did? 
ROGER Oh no, my Doug, not your Doug. Black guy, shaved head? The guys look at each other, confused. 
ROGER (CONT'D) He's a cake designer, he said he met you guys at some sort of birthday party at the Rio? 
VICK (snapping his finger) The guy from the Jimmy Lang surveillance video. The guys nod, right. 
ROGER Anyway, for the big finale of our show, we always bring someone on stage, and, well, Stu, you volunteered pretty aggressively. (to nearby dancer) Hey Dallas, do we have the video of last night's show? 
STU No! That's cool, I don't need to see it-- 
VICK We must see that video. 
DALLAS It's in the machine. Roger nods and presses PLAY on a little VCR/TV combo sitting in front of his mirror. ON THE TV a very Brokeback, Chippendale's-style male revue starts playing. Stu GASPS. Roger fast forwards. 
ROGER You were pretty mellow at first, Stu, but once we got you into the chaps, you really came alive-- oh, here it is. 
ON THE TV we see Stu, wearing only his "I    ROGER" g-string and assless chaps, grinding on stage with the Golden Pony dancers. He is way fatter, paler, and hairier than the greased young studs. The guys look away, oooo. 
STU I'm a Dad, I-I don't get to the gym as much as I'd like... 
ROGER You even taught us The Pony, which we'd never even heard of before... ON THE TV Stu gets on all fours on the stage, and eagerly gestures for the dancers to take turns "riding" him. Stu's face drops. 
ROGER (CONT'D) And then, of course, the pièce de resistance: the Ride of the Valkyries. ON THE VIDEO Stu clutches onto Roger from behind as they ride a LAVENDER MECHANICAL BULL together. The crowd goes wild. 
STU Annnnd that would explain the searing ass pain. 
ROGER After the show, we split a couple pitchers of flirtinis, you had our stylist cut your hair like mine, and then you split. 
VICK And what time was all this? 
ROGER 4:30 in the morning? 4:45? 
ALAN And our Doug was with us? 
ROGER Yeah, he had passed out by then, but you carried him out. It was all very Officer And A Gentleman. The guys look at each other, confused. 
ALAN Wait, so we left with Doug at 4:45, we got back to the hotel at 5:00, and Doug was gone by 5:30 when Chastity met back up with us? 
STU That doesn't make any sense. 
VICK Did we lose him along the way? 
STU He was passed out, how far could he have gone--? Just then, Vick's cellphone rings. The caller ID reads "MANDALAY BAY." He answers: 
VICK Hello? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
ALAN Oh yeah? 
CHASTITY Yeah. I work here on the weekends. 
ALAN You fly out every week? 
CHASTITY Yeah. I'd move, but my kid is in a great school. 
ALAN Kid? 
VICK (aside, to Stu) They always have kids. 
CHASTITY I have a little girl, Sarah. She's... Well, she's everything. Chastity proudly shows Alan a photo from her purse of a cute little toddler. Alan smiles. 
CHASTITY (CONT'D) What about you? 
ALAN No kids. Same girlfriend for 14 years. Becky. Alan shows her a photo of Becky on his cellphone. 
CHASTITY Wow, she's stunning. Stu turns around, unable to keep quiet any longer: 
STU We like you way better. 
ALAN 
STU! Chastity tries to stymie her laugh. 
ALAN (CONT'D) Becky is great. 
STU Becky collects teapots. 
VICK Yeah, she's a total canwego. 
CHASTITY A what? 
VICK You know, she's the girl at the party who's always like "Can we go? Can we go?" Chastity laughs. Alan does too, shaking his head. 
ALAN She has low blood sugar. 
STU She has low fun sugar. 
ALAN Jesus, guys! This is the girl I'm going to marry! (beat, considers) If, you know...she forgives me for cheating on her... 
VICK Wait: you're going to tell her? 
ALAN Of course I'm going to tell her! I could never keep something like that from her. 
VICK Dude, she still hasn't forgiven me for scratching her Queensryche CD in sixth grade -- she's neeeeever gonna forgive you for marrying a stripper in Vegas. 
ALAN Well, then that's just the price I'm going to have to pay. Alan looks off, stoic. Chastity pats his hand, proud. 
CHASTITY Good for you. She smiles at Alan, impressed, pulling her hair from her face. Alan looks at her anew... It's a sweet moment... 
VICK She's gonna cut your dick off, dude. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- NIGHT 
Lamborghini's, Ferrari's and Hummer limos clog the valet stand. Vick rolls up in his clunker. The guys hop out. 
VICK (to the valet) Keep `er close, Paco. We'll be right back. 
INT. MANDALAY BAY -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT 
Chastity and the guys hurry down the hallway to their suite. Vick unlocks their door and pushes inside. 
VICK Doug! Wake up, man! 
STU (CONT'D) Were any of your deals...real? 
VICK 
(GUILTY) Some. Stu drops onto the couch, deeply disillusioned... 
STU Dude, I manage an Applebee's, that money meant something to me... Vick spins around, furious: 
VICK Do you really think I wanted my life to turn out like this, Stu?! Do you really think I don't know that I'm a massive loser?! 
(MORE) 
VICK (CONT'D) Jesus, you guys got out of high school and you just knew what to do, you went to college and got good jobs and found cool wives and made beautiful children -- what do I have to show for the last decade of my life?! Nothing! Vick swats a lamp off a nearby end-table -- it SMASHES against the wall! The guys freeze. Tense silence. Vick grows emotional. 
VICK (CONT'D) Jesus, I'm almost 30, and the only thing I really have...the only thing I really have is you guys. 
STU Come on, Vick-- 
VICK No, man, it's true! I put on a good show, but my life is so goddamn hollow and vapid and lonely, it scares me, man. I-I don't know how much longer I can keep this scam going. And now I've gone and ruined the one good thing I had... Tears threaten in his eyes. He wipes at them, angry. 
VICK (CONT'D) Just...please don't give up on me, okay? I-I don't know what I'd do without you guys. I really don't... Alan and Stu exchange a look. They've never seen brash, cocky Vick this vulnerable before. Stu can't help but give in. 
STU Come on, man, we've been bro's since third grade, it's gonna take a lot more than money to ruin our friendship. Vick looks down, deeply touched... 
STU (CONT'D) What I don't understand is why you didn't just ask me for the money. I would've given you every last cent I had, man... 
Tears trail down Vick's cheeks. He crosses and gives Stu a hug. Stu hugs back, emotional. 
STU (CONT'D) I love you, man. 
VICK Love you too, bro. Love you too. They hug tight. For a while. 
STU Also, I banged your sister sophomore year. Vick pulls away. 
VICK What?! 
STU Sorry. Just seemed like a good time to tell you. Vick stammers at Stu, speechless. 
STU (CONT'D) She had just broken up with that guy from Central, we were playing "I Never" at Tim Donahee's pool, one thing lead to another-- 
VICK No! No. That's...that's plenty. Vick desperately tries to clear the image from his mind. Alan just frowns at his watch, stressed. 
ALAN Look, I'm glad we're all sharing, but we've got three hours to come up with 200 grand, or else... The guys nod, frowning, back on point. 
ALAN (CONT'D) I'd offer to take a loan out, but it's 3 o'clock in the morning, I'm pretty sure my bank is closed. 
STU I think I can get a 20 grand cash advance on my credit card... 
ALAN So that just leaves 180 grand... The guys frown at each other. 
CHASTITY Well, it is Vegas... The guys' eyebrows all rise, you think...? 
SMASH CUT TO: 
ALAN THROWING DOWN BLACKJACK AT A BLACKJACK TABLE The guys erupt in CHEERS around him, YAAA! The dealer slides over a large pile of CHIPS. 
CUT TO: 
CHASTITY THROWING CRAPS AT A CRAPS TABLE Again the guys erupt! Alan hugs Chastity. Their pile of CHIPS grows... 
CUT TO: 
STU YELLING "BINGO" AT A BINGO TABLE The guys jump up, slapping ten, YELLING! Stu points at a table full of OLD LADIES nearby: in your face! 
CUT TO: 
ALAN, STU, VICK AND CHASTITY SITTING AT A PAI GOW TABLE looking lost. Then they take their large stack of chips and quietly leave. No one knows how to play Pai Gow poker. 
Vick's car races down a dark, abandoned desert highway. The guys look tired, stressed, and most of all, scared. 
ALAN Yep, just driving out to the middle of desert to meet some mobsters, what could possibly go wrong...? The guys all frown. 
STU So what's our plan? 
ALAN I think we should tell Mr. Lang that we couldn't get the money, but that, if he's amenable, we could create a payment calendar-- 
VICK We're gonna give Jimmy a dummy bag of money, grab Doug, and make a run for it. 
ALAN Yes, good! What an airtight plan--! 
VICK Jimmy Lang doesn't do payment calendars, Alan! Trust me: this is our only shot of getting Doug back! Left turn! Vick skids onto Highway 12 -- a barely labelled dirt road. Things are quickly going from bad to worse... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE FIRST RAYS OF DAWN streaking across Venice Beach. 
TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 6:04AM" 
INT. VENICE BUNGALOW -- MORNING 
Tracy exits her bedroom in her jammies, looking like she barely slept. Her father is up, and making breakfast. 
TRACY Any word from Doug? 
MR. TURNER Nope. 
(BEAT) I know you don't want to hear it, Trace, but you deserve better. Tracy frowns, overwhelmed with stress. 
TRACY I'm sure everything's fine. They're all smart, capable adults... 
CUT TO: 
VICK DELICATELY LAYING CASH INSIDE HIS DUFFEL BAG on top of his dirty clothing, fruitlessly trying to create the appearance of a bag full of money. He's using some $20 bills, but also some $5's and $1's. 
VICK This all the cash we got? The guys frown at their empty wallets, yeah. We are 
INT. VICK'S CAR/EXT. MOJAVE DESERT -- DAWN 
The Caddy is parked next to MILE MARKER 26 in the middle of the windy desert. The Las Vegas skyline is just barely visible in the distance. Vick very delicately zips up his duffel bag so as not to disturb the bills, and places it on his lap. 
ALAN This is the dumbest plan ever. 
VICK Alan I need you positive please. 
STU Here they come. They all look up to see a WHITE YUKON approaching on the far horizon, kicking up a trail of dust. The guys tense up. 
VICK Stuart? 
STU Yeah? 
VICK There's an emergency bottle of tequila in my glove box. Get it out please. Stu opens the glovebox, pulls out a bottle of Patron. He opens it, takes a swig, then passes it to Vick, who takes a pull and passes it to Alan, who also drinks. They all watch the white Yukon draw ever closer. 
ALAN I can't believe this is how we're going to die... The Yukon pulls up about ten yards away. No one moves. The Yukon's doors open... The Cadillac's doors open... TIGHT ON the Jimmy Lang's RED BOOT as it hits the road... 
TIGHT ON Vick's LEATHER SHOE, then Alan's SAILING TOPSIDER, then Stu's FLIP-FLOP, as they all hit the dusty road... The two parties stand by their respective cars, facing off. Somewhere in the desert, a rattlesnake RATTLES. 
JIMMY LANG Let's see the money! Vick gently holds up his duffel bag. 
VICK Let's see Doug! Jimmy Lang nods to Kalolo, who opens the back door of the Yukon and pulls out a GUY with his hands tied behind his back and a plastic RALPH'S BAG over his head; he struggles a bit. The guys look a bit alarmed. 
ALAN Jesus, what'd they do to him? 
VICK Pull off the Ralph's bag! Jimmy yanks the bag off of the guy's head to reveal 
IT'S NOT DOUG It's some black dude. Vick, Stu, and Alan look confused. 
STU 
CAN SOMEONE PLEASE TELL ME WHERE 
DOUG IS?! 
VICK He's on the roof! Stu looks confused, the roof? 
ALAN After Doug passed out, we must've taken him up there in his bed as a prank, so he'd wake up on the roof or whatever? Then we forgot him. 
VICK And all day he's been throwing his crap off the roof, trying to signal someone to get him down! 
STU You think he's still up there?! 
ALAN Only one way to find out... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- DAY 
The guys peel up to the valet and sprint out of the car. 
INT. MANDALAY BAY -- LOBBY -- DAY 
The guys race through the lobby at top speed. 
EXT. MANDALAY BAY -- ROOFTOP -- DAY 
The guys burst out of the steel door, onto the massive black tar roof. It's empty. 
ALAN 
DOUG?! DOUG?! 
VICK 
WHERE ARE YOU, MAN?! But Doug is nowhere to be seen. The guys start to despair... Then...stepping out from behind an air-conditioning vent, naked except for tighty-whities, his entire body bright pink from sunburn... 
IS DOUG! And he looks furious. The guys run to him, overjoyed! 
ALAN 
DOUG! 
STU Oh my god, I'm so glad you're okay! 
Before they can hug him, though, Doug holds up his hand, and whispers, nasty, parched: 
DOUG Don't...even...talk to me. The guys stop short. 
VICK Okay, no, that's cool! 
STU Yeah, you have every right to be upset! We validate your anger! 
CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 7:05AM" 
EXT. MANDALAY BAY/INT. VICK'S CAR -- MORNING 
The guys gingerly rush Doug, now in a Mandalay Bay bathrobe and clutching an arm-full of BOTTLED WATERS, through the hotel lobby. Alan is arguing into his cellphone. As they pass ATASHIR at his desk, Vick yells over: 
VICK Why'd you do it, sweet Atashir?! Why did you betray us?! 
ATASHIR Because they paid me. And also because you're kind of racist. 
VICK Fair enough! See you next time, you beautiful Judas! They blow out of the hotel... 
TITLE CARD: "SUNDAY, 10:19AM" 
INT. BRIDAL SUITE -- DAY 
Tracy paces in the bridal suite. Then Mr. Turner enters. 
MR. TURNER I'm sorry, honey, but I think you need to seriously consider that Doug might not be coming... Tracy stops short, speechless. 
MR. TURNER (CONT'D) Some men just aren't cut out for this kind of commitment. I'm so sorry that this is how you had to find out-- Just then, we hear a car SQUEALING UP outside... 
INT. BEL AIR BAY CLUB 
The Bridesmaids sit around the posh lobby, waiting, anxious. Just then, the doors blow open and 
VICK, ALAN, STU, AND DOUG stride inside! Their tuxes are wrinkled, their hair is a mess, and the groom is bright pink -- but they're here. 
VICK Sorry, Mapquest took us a crazy route. We ready to do this thing? The bridesmaids sit up, stunned. 
CUT TO: 
TRACY AND HER FATHER walking down the aisle, arm-in-arm, as Mozart plays. Tracy looks tentative. Her father frowns, not at all happy... 
IN THE AUDIENCE Everyone smiles, AHHS, and snaps photos... 
AT THE ALTAR The groomsmen smile as well. Vick whispers to Doug: 
VICK She looks beautiful, man. 
Doug still doesn't speak to him. 
VICK (CONT'D) That's cool. I get it. 
TRACY reaches the altar, then turns to her dad. His face is a mess of emotions. They hug. 
TRACY I love you, Daddy. 
MR. TURNER I love you too, pumpkin. Tracy's Dad shoots Doug a nasty look before taking his seat in the first row. Then Tracy approaches Doug at the altar, and whispers to him, angry, hurt: 
TRACY Where were you? And why are you pink? 
DOUG It's a long story. All I can say is I'm so sorry. And I promise, for as long as we're married, I will never ever put you through something like this again. (desperate, pleading) Can... Can you forgive me? Tracy studies his face, searching... All the guests wait with bated breath... The groomsmen wince, come on come on come on... Then, unable to be mad at Doug, Tracy smiles and kisses him. He kisses her back. The guests all SIGH in relief. The groomsmen exhale, whew. Vick and Alan covertly knock fists. The Minister clears his throat. 
MINISTER We, um, we traditionally wait til the end for the kiss...? But Doug and Tracy just keep on kissing... 
MATCH DISSOLVE TO: 
DOUG AND TRACY STILL KISSING at the reception. The entire wedding party is applauding. 
CHAMPAGNE IS UNCORKED and the WEDDING BAND kicks in. We are now down on the lawn, where white tables and a dance floor have been set up. 
STANDING IN THE BACK OF THE RECEPTION Vick, Stu, and Alan aggressively APPLAUD and WHISTLE for the bride and the groom. 
VICK We did it, fellahs. We pulled it off. 
ALAN I never had a doubt. They LAUGH. Alan smiles, more relaxed than we've ever seen him. They sip champagne and watch Doug and Tracy enjoy their first dance on the dance floor. 
STU You think Doug's ever going to talk to us again? 
VICK Give him time. 
ALAN Yeah. Like a decade or two-- Then Stu sees someone approaching over Alan's shoulder. 
STU Uh-oh. The guys all look over to see 
BECKY Alan's girlfriend of 14 years, bearing down on them, irate. 
VICK Hey Beck--!

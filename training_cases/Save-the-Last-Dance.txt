JUNE 11, 1999 
FADE IN: 
1   EXT. PENNSYLVANIA COUNTRYSIDE - LONG SHOT - DAY            1 
of an empty stretch of land parted down the middle by railroad tracks. An Amtrak Commuter crests the horizon, heads TOWARD us. As it gets CLOSER, we GO IN TIGHTER to see -- 
2   FACE OF SARA JOHNSON                                       2 
17, pressed at one of its windows. 
3   REVERSE ANGLE - REFLECTION IN TRAIN'S WINDOW -             3 SARA'S FACE 
distant and lovely and sad. SUPERIMPOSED against an endless stream of sky and trees. The train speeds up and SARA's face flies by, disappearing FROM FRAME. 
4   INT. AMTRAK TRAIN - MOVING - DUSK                          4 
A zaftig BLACK WOMAN clumsily negotiates the aisle. Stops at the first of a few empty seats left in the car. 
WOMAN This seat taken? 
ANGLE ON SARA 
looking up, around. She shakes her head, clears her backpack and magazines from the seat beside her. The Woman drops down, settles in. A long silence. The Woman glances at the American Ballet magazine on Sara's lap. Tries to make conversation. 
WOMAN I love ballet. Never had the body for it. Do you dance? 
Sara folds her arms, turns away mumbling under breath. 
SARA Used to. 
Sara gazes out the window. The world outside begins to dissolve melting into images from another time, another place. Her eyes stare blankly OUT AT us, blinded by her memories. 
5   FLASHBACK - INT. AUDITORIUM - KINDERGARTEN RECITAL - DAY 5 
A stage full of five-year-olds in tights and tutus. A little girl performs center stage. She's remarkably poised, remarkably good. CAMERA PANS TO the audience. A woman in an Irish clover necklace springs to her feet clapping loudly. The little girl's eyes catch the glint of the necklace's gold. Mommy. She flashes a megawatt smile, ends the dance with an unscripted bow, as we... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
6   INT. BALLET CLASS - EVENING (FIVE YEARS LATER)                6 
Young Sara, lithe and earnest, dances. A budding beauty blessed with long limbs and natural grace, she makes it look easy. Gliding past the envious stares of classmates, she scans the hall for a glint of gold. Finds it in the back of the room where her mother, Glynn, stands watching her. Their eyes connect with mutual smiles and those smiles CARRY us TO: 
7   INT. SARA'S EXETER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                  7 
A pair of flexing feet in ballet slippers on a hardwood floor. PAN UP and PULL BACK to reveal Sara at 17, dancing in the space opened up by cornered furniture and rolled up rugs. As Glynn looks on, Sara completes the routine with a pirouette. She spins out of it with a preoccupied frown on her face. 
GLYNN What's the matter?   It was good. 
SARA (checks her stance in mirror) Everybody there's going to be good, Mom. I have to be better. (then, beginning again) My knees still knock when I do my free form. Did you notice that? 
GLYNN I noticed that it was fine. 
SARA (escalating frustration) It's not supposed to be fine. It's supposed to be special. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
7   CONTINUED:                                                     7 
SARA (CONT'D) And it just lays there, it doesn't do anything. I bet they notice that. That it doesn't do anything. That I don't do anything special enough to get in. 
GLYNN Sara.   You'll get in. 
SARA Don't lie because you love me.     My free form sucks. 
GLYNN (giving up that battle) I've got something for you. Come on. Sit. Mouth closed, eyes shut. No pouting. No peeking. 
Sara lying in bed... wide awake... her stiff upper lip quivering. She slips out of bed, creeps on tiptoes into the bathroom. Closes the door oh-so-quietly behind her. She flips on the light, crosses to the sink, turns on both faucets. As the water flows and the PIPES RATTLE, the brick wall shatters. Sara crumbles to the floor. Buries her head in her arms. Cries like a baby. 
35   INT./EXT. ROY'S PICKUP (SOUTH BALTIMORE) -                     35 NEXT MORNING 
Roy and Sara. Barreling through the south end, tongues stuck in gear. A Pop-Tart grows cold on Sara's lap. Then, finally. 
SARA I can take the school bus. Tomorrow. 
ROY School bus? That's the other Oz, Dorothy. Patterson kids ride the city Metro. Or walk. 
(CONTINUED) 
35   CONTINUED:                                                     35 
SARA Well, I know how to do both. 
ROY Not around here you don't. Not until you get the hang of things. 
Sara looks out the window at a full-fledged ghetto. It's all to obvious, the hang of things. Roy glances over at her. 
ROY I called about your transcripts. You're all set. Patterson's got a pretty good Humanities program. No ballet, but we can find a studio someplace close for after school -- 
SARA -- I don't think I'll have time. I have to study, I'll be busy. 
Roy can hear the lie behind her words.      The pain too. He lights a cigarette, cracks the window.      He wants to say the right thing. 
ROY Good idea. Take a break. Not too long a break though. You're a dancer. You should dance. Stay on top of your art. 
SARA Like you stay on top of yours? 
ROY Maybe I ain't playin' no grand ballrooms or fancy jazz festivals, but I'm playing. 
SARA (unconvincingly) I didn't mean it like that. 
ROY S'alright. Hell, I wish I had half the time I wasted gettin' wasted. But those days are over. You'll see. I got my life on track. 
36   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH SCHOOL (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - MORNING       36 
Formidably large and surprisingly well-kept, Patterson serves the nearby, predominantly black O'Donnell Heights Projects. Kids malinger outside on the front steps and lawn. 
37   FROM ANOTHER ANGLE - PARKING LOT                             37 
Roy's pickup pulls in. Roy CUTS the ENGINE. Sara looks at him. Or through him. She won't let his eyes connect. 
SARA You don't have to go in with me. Since I'm all set. I mean, I have done this before. Gone to school. I'll be fine. I am fine. Really. 
Roy regards her with weary resignation.   Sara climbs out. He calls after her. 
ROY -- Pick you up. Three-thirty. 
SARA (over a shoulder) Yeah.   Sure. Whatever. 
38   EXT./INT. PATTERSON HIGH - MORNING                           38 
Sara moving TOWARD us PAST a floating mosaic of black faces. This is a near out-of-body experience for her. She walks like a well-rehearsed soldier in a stiff straight line to the school's entrance. It's clogged with students. Inside the doorway, two security guards flank a metal detector. When it's Sara's turn to pass through, one of the guards grabs her backpack and wordlessly begins searching it. He hands it back to her on the other side of the detector where Sara stands obtusely and mutely amazed. 
39   INT. ADMINISTRATION BUILDING - MORNING                       39 
THROUGH a window, Sara seated across from an ADMINISTRATOR. We PUSH IN. 
ADMINISTRATOR ... It's no fun being uprooted in the middle of your senior year. We realize that and we'll do what we can to help with the transition. 
(CONTINUED) 
39   CONTINUED:                                                        39 
There's a KNOCK at door. MRS. GWYNN, the Guidance Counselor, steps in. The Administrator introduces her to Sara. Sara regards Mrs. Gwynn with polite petulance. 
MRS. GWYNN Any questions?     Concerns? 
SARA About school?     No.   Not really. 
MRS. GWYNN Not even about Baltimore? 
SARA I'm not gonna be here that long. Besides, it's just a city, right? 
Mrs. Gwynn looks at her squarely. But the brick wall doesn't move an inch. Sara feels too safe behind it. 
40   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                            40 
Clutching new textbooks, Sara starts down the hallway. She's hoping nothing in her face reveals the rising panic in her heart. She's surrounded. Alone. Every inch of her feels afraid. 
SARA'S POV 
as she MOVES FORWARD. A crush of KIDS -- mostly black with a sprinkling of white and Latino faces thrown in. Kids like her. Only they don't dress like her. They dress like commercials for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein. And they definitely don't sound like her... 
44   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CAFETERIA - NOON                             44 
Lunchtime. PICK UP Sara among a cattle drive of boisterous students. 
45   CAFETERIA - FOOD LINE - LATER                                        45 
Hundreds of voices unleashed in pure, unadulterated teenage cacophony. Sara's in a queue of kids, working her way down the line. 
(CONTINUED) 
45   CONTINUED:                                                    45 
She's as invisible and anonymous as ever. CAMERA TRACKS her FROM the line, TO the cashier, INTO the heart of the dining hall. She stands with a food tray, looking for a place to sit. 
HER POV 
Table cliques of the cafeteria. 
SERIES OF SWEEPING SHOTS 
46   JOCK TABLE                                                    46 
Two tables pushed together.    Full. 
47   NERD TABLE                                                    47 
Barely, pathetically populated but surprisingly diverse. 
48   HIP-HOP TABLE                                                 48 
Loud, overflowing, fun.    King Patrick and his loyal subjects horse around. 
49   POPULAR TABLE                                                 49 
Over which a glacial beauty we will come to know as NIKKI DAVIS presides. Girls only. 
50   WHITE TABLE 
Notable for its glaring absence of color.    A girl we will come to know as TONI sits there. 
And then PUSHING IN ON -- 
51   CHENILLE'S TABLE                                              51 
She's there with a group of girls who eschew pretense. They, like Chenille, are rugged and regular. They know who they are. 
END OF SERIES OF SWEEPING SHOTS. 
52   ANGLE ON SARA                                                 52 
eyeing Chenille's table. Screwing up courage as she approaches it. She gets there but two black girls are faster. They sit down in the only empty seats. Sara backs off, invisible again. 
ON CHENILLE 
glimpsing Sara from the corner of her eye as Sara walks away. 
53   AT NERDS' TABLE - LATER                                       53 
Time has    passed. The cafeteria is half as full, half as noisy.     Sara sits among the NERDS, a friendly if verbose group.     She's trying to eat but a snooze button is talking    her to death... 
WONK ... I know you're new to the table, but think about it. We're the Y2K generation and nobody takes us seriously. We don't take ourselves seriously. Just look around. Half the student body is D.O.A. -- and that's from the neck up, Clara. 
SARA Sara.   It's Sara. 
CHENILLE (O.S.) Yeah. It's Sara. And you're boring her from the ears down. 
Sara looks up, surprised to see Chenille standing there. She flashes a knowing smile at her, indicates Sara's tray. 
CHENILLE You finished? 
Sara leaps up with a quick, grateful nod. Beats a hasty retreat from the table. As she and Chenille walk through the cafeteria, Sara shudders with relief. She feels rescued. 
SARA God!    Thank you! 
(CONTINUED) 
53   CONTINUED:                                                      53 
CHENILLE (laughs) Gotta watch where you sit, girl. And it's Chenille. But you're still welcome. Let's catch some air before the bell rings. 
54   EXT. QUAD - MOMENTS LATER                                       54 
Sara follows Chenille into the "QUAD," four squared off sections outside the cafeteria. There are a few dry- rotted picnic tables scattered around. Other kids -- and they run the gamut -- are seen in clots, sneaking smokes... horsing around... making out. 
SARA'S POV - KIDS OF QUAD 
SARA (yanks her hand back) Who died and made you teacher? 
Patrick pulls back, looks at her. He can't believe she dissed him. A small smile forms on his face. Sara turns away from it, goes back to her vials. Patrick slides to the farthest end of the table. Watches her consternation with bemusement. 
PATRICK Know the difference between ethyl glycol and methyl acetate? Both got three elements, two parts the same. It's that first part, C2 versus C3. C3 could blow a vial right out a person's hand. 
Sara thinks he's messing with her. But then the contents of the beaker begin to ominously bubble. Panicked, she drops the vial into their sink. It instantly goes up in smoke. Some of the liquid splashes on Sara's lab coat. Patrick grabs a wet towel, quickly wipes it off. The class stops cold. Hill rushes up to them. Once he's sure Sara's fine, he looks sternly at Patrick. 
MR. HILL What happened?      Everybody back in your seats! 
Patrick stares at Sara.     Her face is red.     She's biting her lip. 
PATRICK I misread the component. 
MR. HILL (even more angry now) You? You misread a component. Don't give me that, Patrick. You were screwin' around! 
(CONTINUED) 
66   CONTINUED:                                                       66 
Hill's tone is searing. He turns to     Sara. She's trying to say something but the words won't    come out. Hill regards her wearily, then walks off    pushing the curious class back to their stations. Sara     looks at Patrick, weakly mouths "thanks." 
67   INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT                                           67 
Over the sound of GRUNTING... OPEN CLOSE ON a girl's plump ass. Squirming in too-tight gym shorts that hug the cheeks. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a stout white girl on a balance beam. Trying to get her legs to stand up on it. Hanging on for dear life. From somewhere around her, a WHISTLE BLOWS. 
TEACHER (O.S.) Alright, Ms. Diggs. Time! 
WIDEN to see the teacher and her class (FAVOR Sara, Chenille, and Nikki). Amid snickers, the stout girl ("DIGGY") slides off the beam, walks past the teacher with her head demurely cast down. Clearing the teacher, Diggy pivots around, both middle fingers in the air. Gives up the double bird with much attitude. The class loves it. Cheers it. Until the teacher swerves around. 
67   SERIES OF CLOSE CUTS                                             67 
Chenille on balance beam.    competent but average. 
Nikki on balance beam.    Agile.   Self-assured.   Good. 
... And then TIGHTER STILL on Sara. Tentatively approaching the balance beam. Mindful of all the eyes on her, all the bated breaths. All waiting to see the new girl fall on her ass. Sara swings herself onto the beam with aplomb. Her legs and body are strong, supple, pliable rubber bands. She flounces across it on her tiptoes. Does a flawless split. Hops off. Looks out. 
SARA'S POV - TEACHER AND CLASS 
Reacting with shock and surprise. Awed. Except for Nikki. She stands there with her arms folded. Simmering. Envious. 
68   PATTERSON HIGH - END OF SCHOOL THAT DAY                          68 
Sara. Heading down the steps with other students. Chenille and Diggy break through the logjam, catch up to her. (CONTINUED) 
68   CONTINUED:                                                        68 
CHENILLE Girl, how you get your legs to twist like that? 
DIGGY (wildly gesticulating) Yeah. What was all that double- jointed cheerleader shit? 
CHENILLE This is Diggy.     Thinks she's down. 
DIGGY Egg-cuse me?     I am down. 
CHENILLE So, Sara.   What's up with that? 
SARA (awkwardly) Nothing's up with it. I used to kind of dance. Ballet. Mostly. 
Chenille makes an impressed face.          Regards Sara curiously. 
CHENILLE You should hit Feetz with us tomorrow night. It's a club. Sorta members only. 
DIGGY Un-der-ground. 
SARA I don't know... 
CHENILLE Come on and hang out. Snook dee's sometime. He can get you in. (yelling) Yo, Snook 
Sara sees Snookie... then Patrick... loping her way. She steels herself. He's going to say something, crack some joke about her nearly blowing him up. But Patrick just stares at her with a twinkle in his eyes. A nice twinkle. Sara's not entirely immune to it. Chenille breaks their eye play, pushes Patrick aside. She grabs Snookie's arm, indicates Sara. 
(CONTINUED) 
68   CONTINUED:                                                      68 
CHENILLE She needs to get hooked up for Feetz. All the way up. Sara, give Snook twenty dollars. 
SARA For what? 
SNOOKIE I.D. Eye-dee. How you think you gettin' in? On your looks? (rolling his eyes) Chenille, your girl is weak. Shit. I got my rep to watch. I can't just be gettin' any green in. 
Sara glares.     Regards Snookie with a sweeping scowl. 
SARA Look closer. And if I still look green, I think maybe you should wipe the crust from your eyes. 
SARA Chenille.   She's ugly.   She's fat! 
CHENILLE She's twenty-one too. I ain't got all night. Let's hop. 
SARA Wait. I have to ask you something. (hard for her) Do I really look alright? 
An unspoken thing passes between them. Chenille suddenly whips off her coat. Gestures at Sara with her head. 
CHENILLE Gimme that '89 Madonna shit.    Your jacket. Give it here. 
Sara takes off the bolero. Chenille ties it around her own neck, then yanks Sara's miniskirt down around her hips. Sara's torso is clad in a long-sleeved cotton tee. Chenille frowns at it. 
SARA It's from the GAP. 
CHENILLE It's country. You look country in it. Take it off. 
SARA I'm not walking in there in my bra. 
(CONTINUED) 
74   CONTINUED:                                                  74 
Chenille thrusts her leather coat at her. Sara can't believe what she's doing, getting (un)dressed on a public street! She pulls off the tee, slips on Chenille's coat. Buttons it as far as the buttons go. Looks down. Half her chest is exposed. 
75   EXT. ALLEY (EAST BALTIMORE) - SARA AND CHENILLE - NIGHT     75 
Gaining on what looks like an abandoned warehouse. Chenille snorts at the roped off queue of kids waiting to get inside. 
CHENILLE Rope dopes.   C'mon. 
She leads Sara to the door of FEETZ. The Sumo-sized MAN guarding it knows Chenille, digs her. His grin exposes gold-capped teeth. 
DOORMAN Chenille.    Lookin' fine.   As always. 
CHENILLE Too fine to stand in line? 
The Man grins, opens the rope, lets them in -- "in" being just inside the front door. A BOUNCER there collects the $10.00 cover charge. Checks their I.D. He hands Sara's back with a smirk. 
BOUNCER Changed your hair. 
He waves a metal detector over their bodies, nods to yet another bouncer who escorts Sara and Chenille through yet another door. 
76   ANOTHER ANGLE                                               76 
They march a short distance to an old elevator where a group of kids wait. Bouncer #2 engages the elevator. Everyone piles in. 
77   INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION                           77 
Sara holds onto her stomach as the CREAKY ELEVATOR descends and the MUSIC below rises. The elevator's vibrating with music. 
(CONTINUED) 
77   CONTINUED:                                                     77 
SARA (an inside to Chenille) Can't get much more underground than this. 
78   INT. FEETZ CLUB - CONTINUOUS ACTION                            78 
A smoky hole in the wall, filled to the brim with kids. Mostly black kids with a few whites and Latinos melting in. They share a common goal: To clog the dance floor, flaunt their outfits and get nasty with the music of the masters: Tupac Shakur, NAS, Lauryn Hill, Puff Daddy, etc. Here, the boundaries of dirty dancing are pushed, from erotic to vulgar; loving to lascivious. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Sara and Chenille. Sara's excited. She loves that she has to shout to be head over the music. 
CHENILLE Let's get our table 'fore it gets crashed and I hafta hurt somebody. 
Sara's bewildered. She doesn't see any tables. She follows Chenille to the back of FEETZ. Sees six or seven tables. All of them have reserved signs. Most of them are filled. 
SARA What are you, some kind of V.I.P.? 
Chenille indicates the deejay booth.     Snookie's in it. 
CHENILLE Snook hooks me up whenever he dees. 
They walk past a SLACKER in lycra pants and a big Army shirt. He licks his tongue at Chenille, grabs at her protruding butt. She swirls around, grabs his crotch hard enough to get his attention. The Slacker is squirming in her clutch. 
SLACKER Aw'right, aw'right. You got it. 
CHENILLE Got what? (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
78   CONTINUED:                                                       78 
CHENILLE (CONT'D) (as he can't think of anything but the squeeze on his balls) The right to walk past your greasy, tickle dick self without your paws on my ass? 'S'that how I got it? 
NIKKI Oh?   It's gonna be like that. 
PATRICK How'd you think it was gonna be? That you was gonna drop me and pick me up whenever you felt like it? 
NIKKI It ain't all that serious, Patrick. 
PATRICK It ain't anymore, Nikki.     Not to me. 
He walks off. CAMERA TRACKS him going deep inside the club. He wants a drink. He's almost at the bar when he sees Chenille on the dance floor with Kenny. She shrugs a smile, then cocks her head over at the bar. Toward Sara. The look is like, help me out. Don't let me leave her hangin'. Patrick rolls his eyes as he glances at Sara, before he really sees her. She looks fly. Hugely fly. He ambles up as she shouts into the bartender's ear. 
SARA Rum and Coke, straight up. And a beer. I don't care. Anything. 
PATRICK (O.S.) Bad choice.      'Anything.' 
The closeness of his voice startles her. She turns into his smile. That cocksure, leave'em-weak-in-the-knees smile. 
SARA It's just a beer. 
PATRICK Then it should be the best beer. You'd know that if you really drank. 
Sara's knees straighten, her spine stiffens.         The asshole's back. 
SARA Whatever. 
PATRICK What's that mean? Whatever. 
(CONTINUED) 
80   CONTINUED:                                                   80 
SARA Whatever you want it to mean. You're the whiz kid, right? You know everything. 
PATRICK (chuckles at this, at her) Not everything. Like I don't know why we're standin' still. (closer with a teasing whisper) I'm supposed to be dizzy by now. Remember? From all those circles you danced around me. 
Sara leans against the bar.    The knees are going again. 
SARA I don't feel like dancing. 
PATRICK But you do know how...? 
SARA Would I be here if I didn't? 
PATRICK ... Let's do it then.    C'mon. 
He coaxes her onto the dance floor. PARLIAMENT'S funk classic "Flashlight" is playing. The dance crowd is robustly singing the refrain to the song. There's a party on the floor. FAVOR Sara and Patrick, facing each other. He's moving already. She starts to dance, stiffly, tentatively. Patrick smiles at her. Shakes his head. He grabs her hands, swings them in time to the music. 
PATRICK Now move your hips. Not so fast. (as Sara looks lost) Sara! Just like our hands. (singing, in sync with the crowd) 'Flashlight! Neon light! Stop light! Everybody got a little light under the sun.' 
The music's beginning to feel good to Sara. Patrick lets go of her hands. Starts to dance. Sara watches him intensely, her body follows his stiffly. Patrick's a good teacher. He leads without leaving her. Whenever she misses a complicated move, he smoothly segues into another less-complicated one. (CONTINUED) 
80   CONTINUED:                                                    80 
Sara begins to pick-up on Patrick's rhythm. Her eyes never wander from his. And then she starts to feel something else. They both do. A rising beat. A quickening heart. And not from the dancing. She smiles bashfully at him. Patrick suddenly grabs her around the waist, pulls her to him in a sexy spoon dance. All Sara can do is try to keep up and hang on. 
FROM ANOTHER ANGLE 
Nikki avidly watching Sara and Patrick with Jasmin and Tiff'ny. 
JASMIN She's all up in your nut, Nikki... Oh, that's right. It ain't your nut anymore. 
NIKKI It is if I want it to be. He is if I want him to be. That bitch ain't got shit on me. 
The girls regard her in conspicuous, dubious silence. Nikki maintains her cool but inside her pride is pricking. 
81   INT. FEETZ - SAME TIME                                        81 
Malakai and the clinging girl nuzzle in a back corner. She licks his ear, whispers into it. Malakai laughs. Then his expression abruptly darkens. A storm cloud comes over it. He gets up. 
MALAKAI'S POV - WALKING TOWARD 
... two dealers a few feet away. They're talking to an Asian guy with a multi-colored Mohawk. One slips Mohawk a packet of coke, the other takes his money. WIDER as Malakai reaches the dealers. He doesn't explain, doesn't complain. He just starts swinging. 
SARA AND PATRICK 
The MUSIC changes and their dance ends. They stand there for a moment, a little caught up in each other. A little unsure of the moment. And then there's a scream! Several of them actually. Patrick reacts to it instinctively. Looking around. In a small pocket of the club he sees Malakai.

PATRICK'S POV - MALAKAI 
in full fisticuffs with the two dealers.     Holding his own. 
ON PATRICK 
PATRICK Why you keep lookin' at me? 
SARA I have to look somewhere. The streets are deserted. Might as well look at you. 
PATRICK That's not why. You wanna know somethin'. Ask somethin'. 
SARA It's not a question. It's the way you were beating that kid up. You looked so mad. 
PATRICK I was mad and he wasn't no kid. But you're from the suburb Mars, right? Folks don't fight there. 
SARA Not like that. (some kind of wonder) You were really kicking his ass. 
It's not funny, the look on her face.      But Patrick laughs. 
SARA Are you laughing at me? 
Dropping the smile, Patrick shakes his head.      Looks at her. 
PATRICK My friend was in trouble. 
SARA Maybe he's my question. Your friend. Chenille doesn't like him. 
PATRICK She likes him. It don't stop her from trippin' off him now and then. But Malakai's good people. We go back. Way back. You know, like they say, through thick and thin. (beat) So, how'd you like Feetz? 
(CONTINUED) 
85   CONTINUED:                                                       85 
SARA It was great. 
PATRICK Once you got used to the music. 
SARA It wasn't the music I wasn't used to. I mean, it's not the first time I heard hip-hop, Patrick. 
PATRICK Uh-huh. Bet you listen to it all the time. 
Patrick regards her with a sly, knowing smile. His stare is significant, unsettling. Sara's face flushes. She turns from him, hoping he didn't see it. 
SARA Not all the time. But a lot. 
PATRICK We gettin' any closer to your crib or should we stop for food and water? 
Sara snaps out of it. Looks around. Shit. First the flush and now this. She looks at him. She could kick herself. 
SARA We passed it. 
PATRICK You passed it. 
A look. They double back to her front door.        Pause on the stoop. 
SARA Thanks for walking me. 
PATRICK No problem. 
SARA So.      I'll see ya. 
PATRICK Is that 'see ya' like gee-whiz, had a great time, can't wait to see you again? (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
85   CONTINUED:                                                       85 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Or is it like 'see ya,' I'll bust a cap in your ass if you ever darken my doorstep again? 
He makes it impossible not to smile.     So damned charming. 
SARA I haven't said gee-whiz since I was six. But I really had a great time... okay? 
PATRICK Okay. 
She enters the rowhouse. Patrick waits until the lights go on inside before he turns around and starts home. 
86   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING                    86 
Roy's making breakfast when Sara straggles in. She peers at the stove. Scrambled eggs and bacon. Toast too! A first for him. 
ROY Figured I'd put a little marrow in your bones. Siddown, siddown. (she slumps in chair) You gettin' along at school? Makin' friends...? (as she nods robotically) ... See any of 'em last night? 
He slides a plate in front of her.      Stands there holding his. 
ROY I came home on my break. 
SARA Oh. 
The succinct sneer in her voice gets to Roy.       He snaps at her. 
90   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY - MORNING                          90 
A fight. Two black girls having at it. It's a ferocious match. Hair pulling, spit flying, punches landed, clothes torn apart. 
ANGLE ON SARA 
as she crowns the corner, comes to a bottleneck of students. It's like the nose bleed section of Caesar's Palace. The far hallway is the ring. Sara cranes her neck to see the action. (CONTINUED) 
90   CONTINUED:                                                   90 
ANGLE WIDENS as a security guard earns his hazard pay. He separates the two girls who are still swinging at each other. He throws one into a corner, hurls the other in an opposite corner. 
ON SARA 
as a WHITE GIRL standing next to her shakes her head lamentably. 
SARA What happened? 
The White Girl studies Sara's suburban clothes and fresh- scrubbed face. Thinks she found a kindred spirit. 
TONY (WHITE GIRL) We freed the slaves and didn't teach them no manners. (before Sara can react) You're Sara, right? (as Sara warily nods) Toni. I was gonna introduce myself before but you're always with that crowd. You know. Chenille, her girls, that identity crisis Diggy. 
Sara looks at Toni. Getting it. Getting her. The expression on her face closes off. Toni, too dense to read it, keeps talking. 
TONI (brightly) We should hang out sometime, Sara. The two of us. Whenever you decide to lose the tan? 
Her inference clear, Toni flashes a brilliant smile, happily walks off. Sara shakes her head to herself. What an idiot. 
As Sara continues down the hall, a P.A. address comes on. 
P.A. ADDRESS (V.O.) Seniors, a reminder before you rise up and change the world. Mrs. Gwynn is holding all diplomas hostage in her office. Her only demand is the pleasure of your company for career D-Day. Be there. 
Sara enters her classroom, a bunch of kids in front of and behind her. 
91   EXT./INT. STREET/ROY'S ROWHOUSE (SO. BALTIMORE) - DAY           91 
Sara walks up the street (passing many black people), sees Roys' pickup. Shit. He's home. 
92   CAMERA TRACKS                                                   92 
Sara as she enters their rowhouse, walks up a flight of stairs to their apartment. There's a JAZZ INSTRUMENTAL FAINTLY coming from it. And another NOISE. Foreign and yet familiar. Like grunting... but not. Sara unlocks the door. Opens it. 
93   SARA'S POV - LIVING ROOM                                        93 
Her father's fucking somebody! On the couch. Half on it anyway. In broad daylight! The whore underneath him is moaning. Jesus! 
ANGLE WIDENS as Sara turns away from the spectacle. Reaches for Roy's sax. She blows the longest, shrillest note known to mankind. 
94   ON ROY                                                          94 
The hair on his head stands up.    His body deflates instantly. 
95   INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER                                    95 
Sara sits at the table. Roy enters in a wrinkled T-shirt and battered jeans. His embarrassment is naked. 
ROY I don't know what to say.    I don't. 
SARA How 'bout fuck it? Or should I say fuck her? It's a fuck-fest, Roy. 
ROY Don't talk to    me like that, Sara. (beat) I thought you    were goin' to your friend's house    after school. Obviously, you    changed your mind. So I'm sorry.     Alright? 
SARA Sorry you got caught. 
(CONTINUED) 
95   CONTINUED:                                                   95 
ROY Sorry I got... observed 
The "whore" with the Hich C is RHONDA. She stands between the living area and the kitchen entrance now. Sara tries not to look at her. Can't help it. She has to see the whore. Not bad looking, in a washed out, bottle blonde barfly kind of way. 
RHONDA Don't be mad at him. It's my fault. I'm real sorry, honey. 
ROY It's nobody's 'fault.' It's over. Let it be over. We're all adults. 
Sara glares at him.     The disingenuous Rhonda jumps in. 
RHONDA I think he means you know about sex. That we have it and he likes it. Isn't that what you mean, Roy? 
Sara looks at her.     Bats her eyes.   Hard. 
SARA Really?   How often do you have it? 
RHONDA Things been kind of slow since you got here. Once upon a time we were real rabbits, weren't we, Roy? 
KENNY You don't ask, Chenille. You make demands. You want money, you -- 
CHENILLE -- I want you to pick up some of the slack. You always have an excuse. 
KENNY It's not like that.    I get tied up. 
CHENILLE You wanna talk about tied up? Try gettin' up in the middle of the night to change diapers and give him bottles or stayin' up with him when he's sick and havin' to drag your ass to school the next day. 
KENNY Look.    I'm doin' the best I can. 
CHENILLE It ain't good enough, Kenny! 
112   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GIRLS' LAVATORY - MORNING                  112 
Dripping, out-of-order faucets, graffiti-laced stalls, litter-strewn floors are underscored by the spooky flicker of fluorescent lights. Sara walks in. The bathroom appears to be empty. She's about to enter a stall when she hears the murmur of a voice. A guy's voice. Then a girl's whimper. She eases forward a bit. 
GIRL (O.S.) I don't get paid 'til next week. 
MALE (O.S.) Boo the fuck hoo. You can't put my bizness up your nose on no layaway plan. C'mon now. You know what you gotta do. 
(CONTINUED) 
112   CONTINUED:                                                       112 
Sara ventures carefully forward to the edge of the stall's open door. She cranes her neck trying to see without being sen. 
HER POV - STALL 
A GIRL is seated on the toilet. A man straddles her, his crotch in her face. The Girl sees Sara. Something in her face gives this away. The "man" glances out past his shoulder. He looks right down our throat straight into Sara's eyes. Malakai. 
ON SARA 
SARA What are you doing? 
Malakai backs up. The Girl jumps up, runs out the lavatory. Malakai zips up his pants. Sara's frozen, staring at him. 
MALAKAI You didn't see nothin', you don't say nothin'. Not unless you want a taste for yourself. And that can be arranged. 
He leaves.     Sara waits a moment.   Exits. 
113   HALLWAY                                                          113 
She sees Mr. Hill, starts to move for him. Someone grabs her arm from behind. She turns, startled, a little afraid. It's the Girl from the stall. She looks Sara in the eye. Shakes her head. Don't. Mr. Hill walks by them unbeckoned. 
114   EXT. INNER HARBOR (DOWNTOWN BALTIMORE) - PARK - DAY              114 
A perfect day. CAMERA PANS FROM the waterfront TO the bustling crowds of the inner harbor, then to a park across from this where Sara and Patrick are practicing. HIP-HOP MUSIC softly PLAYS from Patrick's BOOM-BOX. Sara watches his face as they dance. 
PATRICK Didn't you like it when you 'used' to dance? 
(CONTINUED) 
114   CONTINUED:                                                      114 
SARA Yeah I liked it. I was gonna go to Juilliard. That school fucked up my entire life. It's a long story. 
PATRICK Let me guess. You don't wanna talk about it. 
Sara looks at him.     A soft smile is all she offers up. 
115   EXT. PARK - SARA AND PATRICK - LATER                            115 
They lay on their bellies in the grass.       Close to each other. 
PATRICK I stole a bike here once. 
SARA Why'd you do that? 
PATRICK 'Cause I didn't have one. 
SARA That's a good reason. 
PATRICK I used to do wild shit like that. 
SARA You and Malakai? 
PATRICK Yep.   Most of the time. 
SARA I don't get you guys.    You seem so... different. 
PATRICK We're not. 
SARA Maybe you weren't then but you are now. You said you changed. 
PATRICK Doesn't make me different from him. Not the way you think it does. 
SARA I wanted to get you something and I couldn't figure out what. It's not much but I hope you like it. 
Patrick opens the box. Removes a key chain. It's engraved with the medical emblem (snake & staff, etc.). He regards her, touched. 
PATRICK I like it.   I love it.    Thank you. 
SARA Wait.     There's more. 
She leans in, turns the key chain over in his hand. The back side of it is engraved with the words, "PATRICK REYNOLDS, M.D." Patrick locks eyes with Sara, lifts her hand to his lips. Kisses it softly. The gesture is succinct but alluring and, for a brief moment, they're the only two people in the world. 
118   INT./EXT. CITY BUS - SARA AND PATRICK - LATER                      118 
The bus makes a stop and an older white woman gets on. Sits across from Sara and Patrick who have moved even closer to each other. Patrick's arm is around Sara's shoulder. He whispers something in Sara's ear. She laughs and looks up to see the white woman staring at them with a muted but obvious repugnance. Watching the woman from the corner of her eye, Sara drapes her arms around Patrick's neck, nuzzles at his ear. Patrick's eyes widen. Sara, playing this for all it's worth, folds one of her legs between his and whispers: 
SARA We have an audience.      Work with me. 
PATRICK (nonplussed) Work with you? 
SARA (sotto voce, through her teeth) Grab something. 
(CONTINUED) 
118   CONTINUED:                                                   118 
He grabs her ass   -- what else is there? -- runs his hand along her side.    The white woman, thoroughly disgusted, gets up and moves   to the back of the bus. Patrick and Sara look at each   other, burst out laughing. 
119   EXT. BALTIMORE HALL - NIGHT                                  119 
The equivalent of D.C.'s Kennedy Center, the hall is awash in lights and activity. Men and women are donned in formal attire. Parking valets hover on the sidewalks waiting for cars. Into this, Sara and Patrick walk. She looks at the crowd, then sees the overhead banner -- "Boston Ballet, A Command Performance." Sara's heart stops. Her feet freeze. Patrick looks at her. She looks positively catatonic. 
PATRICK Surprise... Sara? 
SARA (quietly urgent) I can't. I can't go in. 
PATRICK (doesn't understand) You have to go in. This is where I'm bringing you. The ballet. 
SARA (beside herself) I know, but -- 
PATRICK (crestfallen) But what? 
Sara looks at him, feeling bad. Feeling stupid for ruining the evening. She bites her lip, shakes her head ("but nothing"). Patrick takes her and they go in. 
120   INT. BALTIMORE HALL - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT                     120 
Sara and Patrick watch the Boston Company perform Igor Stravinsky's "Scenes De Ballet" as choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon. They're both enraptured. But while Patrick keeps sneaking excited glimpses of Sara, her eyes remain fixed on the dancers, the dance. She is utterly, totally engaged and amazed. The yearning that never really left her returns to tug at her heart and project her soul onto the stage. 
121   EXT. STREET (SOMEWHERE IN BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                   121 
Post-ballet, Sara and Patrick walk. She's quiet, introspective. Patrick's at a loss. He can't decipher her mood and, which is more, he's disappointed by it. 
PATRICK I thought you would like it. 
SARA I did. 
PATRICK You ain't actin' like you did. 
She looks over at him, tries to smile. 
SARA I'm sorry. 
They come to a small, secluded bridge.     Sara sits down on the edge of it. Patrick follows suit.      A long moment. 
SARA I don't want you to think I didn't have a good time tonight, Patrick. I did. But ballet isn't a part of my life anymore. 
PATRICK Why not? What happened? You just woke up one day and decided to waste your talent. 
SARA (without rancor) How do you know I have talent? Because I did some stupid leg trick. 
PATRICK I saw the look on your face when you did it, Sara. The same look I saw tonight. Goofy happy. So if you're gonna tell me somethin' about not dancing, at least tell me somethin' real. 
A long, difficult moment wherein Sara attempts to find the words, face the pain that comes with them. Finally, she looks at him. 
SARA Maybe I don't want it to be real. 
(CONTINUED) 
121   CONTINUED:                                                    121 
She stares out at the water, the moon reflected off of it. It's hard to reconcile that beauty and the turmoil she's feeling. But she goes on. 
SARA What I want is to wake up and see my mom. For things to go back to the way they were. When they made sense. When my life made sense. (because) And it's all my fault. She got scraped off the highway for me, for my fucking audition. She was rushing. It was raining. It was raining... (a torrent) ... But she promised to be there. I made her promise. And then I didn't wait for her. I should have but they called my name and I didn't say anything. I just went out and danced. I was mad. I needed her and she wasn't there. 
She buries her face in her hands, breaking down, racked with tears and guilt. Patrick puts his arms around her. 
SARA (inconsolable) She was dying while I was dancing and I was mad at her and I'm sorry. I'm sorry... 
BEGINS OVER THEME MUSIC. 
125   INT. ROY'S APARTMENT - SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT                       125 
Sara in the mirror dressed in leotards and tights.       She bends forward from the hip, extends a leg, a corresponding arm.

OPEN CLOSE ON a black hand shaking a white one. PULL BACK to reveal Patrick and Roy. Sara enters looking striking, pretty, very down. Chenille's influence is written all over her makeup and her clothes. Overlooking Roy, she blithely tags Patrick. 
SARA Let's skip. (cursory, to Roy) Later. 
They leave. Roy stands in the middle of the room, dumbfounded.

Usual suspects, usual music. Patrick hands Sara a call- brand beer. Leans in with his drink, openly and contently with her. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Nikki and her crew (Jasmin, Tiff'nee, Alyssa). Nikki hasn't seen Patrick and Sara. She's showing her crew a dance. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Chenille, Diggy and another black girl.     Fraternizing. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - DEEJAY BOOTH 
A chrome-domed deejay with a Barry White baritone bellows into his mike as he changes the music. 
DEEJAY Master P with the 'Ghetto D'. Showmesomethin', showmesomethin', give up that cruel. Eyes on you! 
WIDER as the dance floor swells with kids. PICK UP Sara and Patrick among them. She looks at him nervously. He smiles. 
PATRICK Nobody's watchin' you but me. 
A gallant lie. Sara tries    to believe it. They dance. Practice has made her near   perfect. Their movements are ambitious, nimble, better   than anyone else on the floor. They move so well together   that Snookie, dancing nearby, starts chanting: 
SNOOKIE Go, Patrick!    Go, Patrick!

FROM ANOTHER ANGLE OF DANCE FLOOR 
CAMERA TRACKS them as they walk down the hall hand-in- hand, sometimes exchanging greetings with other students. They are officially a couple and they appear to be in love. At the door to Sara's next class, Patrick busses her lips before she enters.

TONI 'Hit it and quit it,' that's their motto. 
SARA Whose motto? 
TONI Black guys.    Everybody knows that. 
The teacher walks in.       Sara quickly whispers back to Toni. 
SARA Don't forget, they all have big dicks and beat their wives. Everybody knows that too. 
138   INT. RIB JOINT (SOMEWHERE IN BALTIMORE) - NIGHT                   138 
Malakai, along with Snookie and two brain donors, ARVEL and LIP, eat at a booth. Patrick strolls in gritty from work. Tired from work. He slides in next to Malakai. The mood is light, jovial. 
ARVEL You smell, boy. 
PATRICK How can a piece of shit tell? 
The table cracks up. 
MALAKAI You been scarce lately, man. Where you been? 
ARVEL Somewhere dreamin' of a White Christmas...

PATRICK (snatching up one of his ribs) Back out my business, boy. 
MALAKAI (watching Patrick keenly) You tappin' that white girl, man? (half joking) That's why you ain't got time for your boyz no more, you too busy frontin'. Too busy snowflakin'. 
Patrick lifts one of Malakai's ribs, responds coolly. 
PATRICK How am I frontin', 'Kai? I made time for this bullshit, didn't I? 
LIP Aww, man. You busted. That's why your jaws are gettin' so tight. 
SNOOKIE You the one need his jaws tightened with your pork-ass instigatin' self. 
ARVEL (re: Patrick's roving fingers) Order somethin', Patrick. This ain't no goddamn soup line. 
Patrick grabs some of Arvel's fries, chews them in his face. 
PATRICK Y'all hangin' tonight or what? 
MALAKAI We thinkin' about slidin' through that new rec center opened up on the Eastside. You ridin'?

PATRICK (CONT'D) I ain't messin' with those fools over there. You know how they are. 
MALAKAI I ain't pressed. I got my own shit. 
Shorthand. The table stops. Malakai glances around, lifts his shirt to expose a gun. Patrick stares at Malakai with disbelief. 
MALAKAI What you think? I'ma keep walkin' around waitin' for some chump to cap me? I'ma protect myself. 
PATRICK That ain't protection. It's an excuse for some unnecessary mayhem. 
MALAKAI Ain't nothin' unnecessary 'bout it. Shit. Mayhem and madness. That's a black man's life. 
ROY Yeah? Well, when are you gonna have the guts to say what you really want to say to me, Sara? 
(CONTINUED) 
139   CONTINUED:                                                     139 
SARA (screaming at him) Want me to say it? You were a piece of shit husband and you're a piece of shit father! You were never there for Mom or for me. You took off and never looked back. So don't talk to me about guts. 
Not quite the truth, but near enough to sting. It quiets Roy down. He regards her with regret and guilt. 
ROY Sounds like you have it all figured out. 
SARA I have you figured out. You think you can make up all the time you missed, all the things you didn't do? You can't! I'm here because I have to be and it's a goddamned nightmare. 
ROY Well, you might as well wake up and get used to it, Sara, because that's the way things are sometimes, the way life is. 
SARA How the hell would you know? You've been asleep for the past thirty-seven years! 
Now she does storm off. This time Roy lets her.     He can't find the words to deny what she's said. 
140   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - QUAD OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - DAY             140 
A break between classes draws the requisite claques and cliques. Sara and Patrick huddle over a chemistry book, attentive to each other. Nikki stands off watching both of them. Malakai saunters up to her smoking a joint. Hazily indicates Patrick and Sara. 
MALAKAI The 'Love Boat.' 
NIKKI Love shit. That bitch is tap- dancin' on my last nerve. 
(CONTINUED) 
140   CONTINUED:                                                      140 
MALAKAI Looks like she's tap-dancing on your last boyfriend. She got it like that? Naw. Never mind. Stall it. I ain't heard shit. 
NIKKI Stall what?   What you hear? 
MALAKAI Some trash she's talkin'.   About you. 
NIKKI About me? 
MALAKAI Yeah. How you ain't all 'at since Patrick's takin' her to the prom. (in for the kill) I am a little bit... chagrined though, Nikki. You lettin' some white ho' show you up like that. 
He regards her with bemused pity. Nikki, with all her inner outrage, manages to salvage her pride. She sneers in his face. 
NIKKI Fuck you, Malakai. Fuck her too. 
MALAKAI (gaily, a she sails off) Ain't no need in fuckin' me... stuck up, bitch... I'm on your side 
141   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY                             141 
Patrick drinks at a water fountain. Looks up. Malakai's standing there. There's still some tension between them. 
MALAKAI Yo. Me and the boyz fixin' to shoot some hoops. Us against Druid Hill. If you interested. 
PATRICK Druid Hill?   Hell yeah. 
MALAKAI Gotta skip last period. 
(CONTINUED) 
141   CONTINUED:                                                   141 
PATRICK I got study hall. Don't matter anyway. Not with those suckers. I'll be back before the bell rings. 
They walk off together and, after a few steps, begin dribbling imaginary balls down the hall. 
142   INT. GYM (PATTERSON) - DAY                                   142 
A girls' basketball game in progress. Sara's playing defense. She's on Nikki's team. She blocks a shot but Chenille, on the opposing team, gets it on the rebound. Basket. Nikki shoots Sara a murderous look. Stupid, uncoordinated bitch. 
143   EXT. DRUID HILL PLAYGROUND - BASKETBALL COURT                143 
A four-on-four game in progress. Patrick, Malakai, Snookie and Arvel versus the Druid Hill Two Deuces. An unseen BOOM BOX BLASTS the music of JAY-Z throughout. Patrick has the ball. He passes it to Malakai. They AD- LIB insults to the Two Deuces. This is heaven for them. Talking shit and playing ball. The best time. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
144   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GYM                                    144 
Sara takes her defensive position against an opposing player, successfully blocks the shot, tries to slam the ball to Nikki. It clips Nikki's head, bounces out of bounds. Nikki, her dignity stunned, her patience out, walks up to Sara, shoves her to the floor. Sara looks up at her as some disembodied voice calls out: 
FEMALE VOICE Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'! Stay down, girl! 
145   EXT. DRUID HILL - BASKETBALL COURT                           145 
Malakai dribbles the ball around one of the Two Deuces, skies it. Misses the hoop. Patrick rebounds. Passes it back to 'Kai. He takes the shot. Makes it. Patrick and Arvel strut victoriously. 
DIONDRE (a taunting twist) I can go where I want. You the one on punishment. 
Nikki swings a wet shirt with no intention of hitting him. She looks up. Patrick's standing in the doorway. Diondre runs up to him, holds out the palm of his hand. 
(CONTINUED) 
154   CONTINUED:                                                     154 
DIONDRE There she go.    Gimme my two dollars. 
Patrick pays him. Diondre darts out. Patrick walks up to Nikki. Nikki clenches, tries to dismiss him with a backhanded wave. 
NIKKI Whatever it is, I don't wanna hear it. 
Patrick leans up against a washing machine and for a long moment just looks at her. The walk there has composed his emotions. 
PATRICK I thought you had somethin' to say to me. 
NIKKI You thought wrong. 
An old black woman is avidly, openly watchin' them. Patrick indicates a bench on the other side of the laundromat. Nikki petulantly follows him there. They sit. Patrick looks at her. 
PATRICK Somethin' must be on your mind for you to get up in Sara's face, start all this drama. What you tryin' to prove, Nikki? 
NIKKI You're the one tryin' to prove something. Stuck up in her shit like she's somethin' special. 
PATRICK What if she is? What's it to you? You didn't see me trippin' off that Howard dude and I could have. I coulda tripped hard, Nikki. 
NIKKI That was different. 
PATRICK How you gonna call it different? 
She stands up.     Looks down at him.    Raises her voice. 
(CONTINUED) 
154   CONTINUED:                                                  154 
NIKKI Because she's white and he ain't. And don't sit there like you don't know what I'm talkin' about, Patrick. 
PATRICK (glaring at her) You don't even know what you're talkin' about, Nikki. 
NIKKI I don't?     Y'all black men, soon as you even    think about goin' someplace    good, first thing you do is find a    white girl to take with you. 
OLD WOMAN (O.S.) Uh-huh. 
Patrick glares in the Old Woman's direction, then back at Nikki. 
PATRICK I thought I was goin' someplace good with you. You the one called me off. But you ain't tryin' to remember that. Now you mad. Why? Because she's white and I like her? I'm with her. 
NIKKI Please. You're with her because she's white. That's what sets me off. 
PATRICK (exasperated) It ain't got no business settin' you off! Me and her ain't got nothin' to do with you and what you think. So keep your hands off her and that shit to yourself. 
Nikki folds her arms across her chest, looks at him defiantly. 
NIKKI I don't think it, I know it. But you go ahead, deny it. That's what y'all always do. 
She turns on her heels, goes back to her machine. Patrick rises, sees the old woman glinting at him. He holds her hateful stare for a moment, then walks out. 
155   INT. REYNOLDS' APARTMENT - CHENILLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT           155 
Chenille and Kenny.     In the middle of a contentious moment. He tries to     give her some money. She snatches it out of his hand.     Kenny looks at her. He's hurt. Chenille's too mad to    see it. 
CHENILLE What? I'm supposed to get excited because you decided to skate by and drop a dollar on the dresser? 
KENNY It's more than a dollar. And it's all I got. (beat) I got laid off rom B.W.I., Chenille. I been workin' part- time. Money's tight. You know how you are about money. That's way I haven't been coming around. 
Chenille stares at him for a long moment.       Her voice is low. 
CHENILLE Money ain't got nothin' to do with it, Kenny. You don't come around because you don't feel like comin' around. You don't want the responsibility of comin' around. As long as you out there and I'm in here, you know your son's being taken care of. You ain't got no worries when it comes to him. 
KENNY And you don't have no   feelings when it comes to me.    All you do is bitch and complain   about what I don't do. I get sick    of that. 
CHENILLE Be sick of it. You ain't got to see me to see your son. 
KENNY I'll be sure to keep that in mind. 
He leaves.    Chenille stands there, mad at him.    Mad at herself. 
156   INT. FREE CLINIC (SOUTH BALTIMORE) - DAY                        156 
The lowest common denominator for misery. 
(CONTINUED) 
PATRICK That shit ain't funny. 
SNOOKIE (springing up) Damn right it ain't funny. 
MALAKAI I thought you liked it down there. That's your specialty, ain't it? Crawling? 
SNOOKIE That was a reflex action, man. And you just plain rude and wrong to bring the shit up in mixed company. 
Sara's not quite sure what they're alluding to but she doesn't want the displeasure of Malakai's company. She taps Patrick. 
SARA I gotta get home. Ready? 
Malakai's eyes slice into her. First Snookie, now this bitch. Steppin' all over his conversation with Patrick. 
MALAKAI No, he ain't ready. He's talkin'. To me. A-B conversation. Gotta go? C yourself the fuck home. 
SARA (a real reflex action) Fuck you. 
Malakai lunges for her. The move is so swift and sudden Patrick overturns his stool to dive between them. He sweeps Sara behind him, into the path of a startled 
Snookie. Stands there nose-to-nose with Malakai, staring him down, furious with him. 
PATRICK Have you lost your motherfuckin' MIND, man? Huh? Have you! 
Sara, frightened and frozen, doesn't know what to do. Snookie's voice weakly creaks out. He's trying to rise to the occasion. 
SNOOKIE Patrick, man, c'mon. 
But Malakai and Patrick stay where they stand. Too close for comfort. Both in the danger zone. Malakai regards Patrick with a combination of cruel anger and deep, genuine hurt. 
MALAKAI You take that bitch's back and won't even cover mine? 
PATRICK 'Cause you wrong, Malakai! 
MALAKAI No! You wrong. You BEEN wrong. You ain't worth shit no more. (venomously) Get out my face, and take that ho with you. 
Patrick bucks up. Sara walks over to him, gently clutches his sleeve. It's no easier to turn away from Malakai than it is to walk away from a lifetime of friendship. But Patrick does. With Sara holding onto his arm, at his side, he turns and walks away. 
158   EXT. STREET - SARA AND PATRICK - NIGHT                     158 
walking. A heavy silence. Sara looks over at him. Patrick doesn't say anything. But after a moment, he reaches down and takes her hand and they walk on like this together. 
OVER MUSIC (e.g. BUSTA RHYMES' "Dangerous.") 
159   INT. DANCE STUDIO - SARA AND PATRICK - MORNING             159 
Practice her free form, a hip-hop ballet hybrid. They're both tired, irritable, beaten down. They've been there awhile. Sara makes a misstep. Patrick stops. Cold. Sara grits on him.

SARA We should keep going. 
PATRICK You messed up. 
SARA I know I messed up. I'll get it right the next time. 
PATRICK No. You gonna get it right now so you can do it perfect next time. 
She glares at him, exasperated.         So many things bottled up. 
SARA I can't work like this.      I can't dance like this. 
PATRICK Like what? 
SARA Like this.     You dictating to me. 
He crosses the room, CUTS OFF the MUSIC. Looks at her. Sara walks over to a window seat near him. Flops down. 
PATRICK What's wrong, Sara? 
SARA Nothing's wrong. (except) I can't figure things out. 
PATRICK What things? The audition? You ain't got nothin' to worry about. I told you. I'll be there. 
SARA Things, Patrick. Things between us. Things between us and them. 
PATRICK I didn't know there was a 'them.' 
SARA Well, open your pretty brown eyes, look the hell around. (MORE)

165   INT. SARA'S ROOM - NIGHT                                      165 
Sara's on the futon, flipping through a photo album. Pictures of her and Glynn. Roy knocks on the partition. Waits a beat before he comes in. He looks at Sara. She keeps flipping. 
ROY I was wondering... how long you plan on hating me? Maybe I'm an optimist but I hope there's some kind of timetable. (this raises a small smile) Well, I don't wanna bug you. I just came in to say good luck. 
Sara regards him quizzically. Roy goes to her dresser, picks up an envelope from Juilliard. 
ROY I saw the return address. Got curious. It was open. I read it. I know I shouldn't have but at least now I have an excuse to tell you how proud I am of you, Sara. 
SARA (quietly miserable) I was gonna tell you about the audition, Roy. I meant to. 
She's clutching the photo album.    Roy sits down next to her. 
ROY Tomorrow's the big day? 
SARA Uh-huh.   The big day. 
ROY You bummed out about it? (as she shakes her head) You're a worse liar than I am father.

SARA You're not so bad. (close to a confession) I didn't give you much to work with. It's not like I've been the perfect daughter. 
ROY Well, it ain't like I deserve a perfect daughter. I screwed up. Did everything in a hurry and still thought I had all the time in the world. To be in love with your mother. Be a father to you. But time flies. You look up one day and all you got to show for yourself is a pretty little girl who hates your guts and won't talk to you because too much time went by. 
Sara's eyes well up.    Before she can stop herself,        she's crying. 
SARA I don't hate you. I miss her. I miss Mom... (as Roy takes her in his arms, tries to console her) ... Patrick's pissed at me. I'm pissed at him. He's not coming tomorrow and I want him there and I don't know what to do. 
Sara draws back from Roy, wipes her tears.       Collects herself. 
ROY You want him there. I understand that. But whatever he brings to the table, Patrick can't dance for you, Sara. You're the bottom line out there. This is your chance to be the dancer Juilliard came to see. 
SARA I wanted somebody there who loves me. 
Roy regards her softly, significantly, the irony implicit. 
(CONTINUED) 
165   CONTINUED:                                                     165 
ROY I love you. 
Sara looks up.    For the first time in her life, she believes him. 
166   INT. HOSPITAL - I.C.U. WAITING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING         166 
Patrick's bouncing on his knees, speaking to Arvel's parents, who are clearly stricken. Arvel's father, stoic, holds his wife's hand. Arvel's mother kneads a Kleenex, her face etched with tears. Patrick hugs her. Stands up to see Malakai frozen in the doorway, put off by the palpable grief. Patrick crosses over to him. They retreat quietly into the corridor, their concern for Arvel a shaky ground for conciliation. 
MALAKAI Why his mom's cryin' like that? Arvel's gonna make it, right? That what's his nurse said. She told me herself, 'Your friend's gonna make it.' Did that bitch lie to me! Talk to me, Patrick! Is he gone? 
Patrick steers Malakai away from the waiting room, backs him against a wall and, in a gentle but firm way, holds him there. 
PATRICK They just got bad news, man. They don't need to hear it again. (trying to be strong; faltering) Arvel's fightin'. He's gonna pull through. Thing is, when he does, they don't think... he ain't... shit. Arvel ain't gonna walk again. 
In that moment, whatever's left of Malakai's soul crumbles. He looks at Patrick with aggrieved disbelief and then a building anger. A stronger man would probably cry. 
Patrick eases his grip. Malakai straightens his body, cocks his head slightly. Studies Patrick in this crooked, derisive way. 
MALAKAI I got a good reason now, man? (MORE)

MALAKAI (CONT'D) (off Patrick's silence) Aw'ight, college boy. You do what you think is the right thing. I'ma do what I know is the only thing. 
He starts to walk off, doesn't get far before Patrick calls out. 
PATRICK Malakai... (a fleeting hesitation) ... When it's on, I'll be there. 
167   EXT. PLAYGROUND (O'DONNELL HEIGHTS PARK) - DAY                  167 
Groups of children scatter around worn-out playground equipment. The gleeful squeal of them is everywhere. Patrick guides Christopher down a slide; Chenille catches him at the bottom. Christopher can't get enough of this ride and Patrick and Chenille repeat the routine throughout their conversation. 
CHENILLE Why you so quiet? (off Patrick's brooding look) Patrick Reynolds ain't got nothin' to say? That's a first. (catches her son with a whee!; then) You know how I go off on folks sometimes. I mean it and then I don't mean it. Like what I said to Sara. Guess she told you. 
PATRICK (monotone) I don't care what you said, Chenille. 
CHENILLE Patrick. Your ass is on your back and your lips are on the ground. You care, baby brother. And not just about what I said. (as he looks at her) You seriously like Sara. She got a serious jones for you. Am I lyin'?

PATRICK What you gonna do, 'Kai? You gonna shoot me? Go ahead! You'll have to! 
LIP Let him out!   We don't need him. 
MALAKAI Shut the fuck up. 
Patrick jerks himself loose. Opens the door. Malakai cocks the gun. Patrick's face flinches at the sound of it. He can feel it trained on his back as he gets out the car. But Malakai can't do it. Wouldn't do it. He takes off like a bat out of hell. 
174   EXT. STREET                                                       174 
Patrick heads down the street. As he walks, he can hear the sound of GUNFIRE behind him, and then the sound like an EXPLOSION. A CAR HORN goes off in a persistent drone. Patrick stops. Stands there for a moment. Then he's walking again. Without looking back. And then he's running away from the mayhem behind him. 
175   EXT. STREET - SAME TIME                                           175

176   INT. BALTIMORE SCHOOL OF PERFORMING ARTS - AUDITORIUM -           176 NIGHT 
Pince-Nez leads Sara to the stage.      Announces her. 
Sara walks onstage. 
She nods down at the judges, looks out into the audience. Her eyes anxiously search for Patrick... hoping. Her MUSIC begins. 
Grieg's Peer Gynt (Morning). Sara starts to sway, moving like an angel through the soft cloud of this music. Her line, proportion and balance are impeccable.

Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake (Tanz der Schwane) begins and Sara slowly blossoms, opening herself up to the music like a flower. She completes every turn and twist and leap with confidence, energy and persuasion. She is doing what a dancer should do -- engaging the audience, igniting their imagination, drawing them in. 
ANGLE - JUDGES 
perking up, taking notes, attentive to her. 
SARA 
finishes with a flawless arabesque.      Looks out. 
REVERSE ANGLE - JUDGES 
One of the more imperious-appearing JUDGES removes his glasses, speaks to her. Sara's still trying to catch her breath. 
STERN JUDGE You prepared a free-form? 
SARA Yes... sir... they have... my music. 
JUDGE Does it have a theme? 
SARA Yes.  Emo... (clears her throat) Emotion. 
The Judge turns around, shouts to someone we can't see: 
STERN JUDGE Cue Johnson's music. 
MUSIC UP: A remix of hip-hop (e.g., LAURYN'S HILL'S doo wop; NAS'S "We Will Survive" and JAY Z's latest) and snatches of CLASSICAL. 
SARA 
stands there. Doesn't move. Can't. She finally walks up to the edge of the stage. Looks down at the judges, her eyes filled with trepidation. Her voice is a shaky whisper. (CONTINUED)

SARA I'm sorry. I wasn't ready.       Can you start it over again? 
REVERSE ANGLE 
The Judge waving off the MUSIC.      It STOPS.      He regards Sara impatiently. 
STERN JUDGE Are you ready now? 
Before she can respond, Patrick's voice booms from the back of the auditorium. 
PATRICK (O.S.) Yes, sir.    She's ready. 
ANGLE WIDENS to reveal him coming forward. Rushing for the stage. He pauses at the apron of it. Looks up at Sara. She peers down at him, astounded. Shaken. He smiles at her. She smiles back. Patrick's eyes softly take her in. 
PATRICK You can do it. (because) Ain't nobody watchin' you but me. 
Sara's eyes focus on him.       She nods.     Turns to the judges.

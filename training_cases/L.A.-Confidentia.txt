Based on the novel by James Ellroy

FADE IN: 
OVER the opening strains of "I LOVE YOU, CALIFORNIA," a MONTAGE:  a mixture of headlines, newsreel footage and live action.  Economy Booming!  Postwar Optimism!  L.A.: City of the Future!  But most prominent among them: GANGLAND!  Police photographers document crime scenes. The meat wagon hauls ex-button men to the morgue.  Where will it end? 
EXT. L.A. SKYLINE - SUNSET 
Palm trees in silhouette against a cherry sky.  City lights twinkle.  Los Angeles.  A place where anything is possible.  A place where dreams come true.  As the sky darkens, triple-kleig lights begin to sweep back and forth. 
EXT. MANSION (HANCOCK PARK) - NIGHT 
The KLEIG LIGHTS are out front.  Valets hurry to park a line of elegant cars. 
MAYOR (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the future of Los Angeles! 
INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT 
The MAYOR yanks a cloth to reveal a MODEL of L.A. criss- crossed by an elaborate FREEWAY SYSTEM.  The CROWD oohs. A COUNCILMAN claps.  A SOCIETY MATRON nods her approval. 
PIERCE PATCHETT, 50, tuxedoed, watches off to one side. A behind-the-scenes power broker, Patchett exudes authority much more so than the Mayor does. 
MAYOR The Arroyo Seco freeway is just the beginning.  We're planning freeways from Downtown to Santa Monica, from the South Bay to the San Fernando Valley.  Twenty minutes to work or play is the longest you'll have to travel. 
More applause.  One REPORTER asks a little too loudly... 
REPORTER How many bodies you think Mickey Cohen'll be able to hide in all that cement? 
The Mayor wears a plastic smile, ignores it. 
INT. THE MOCAMBO - NIGHT 
A CLUB PHOTOGRAPHER pops snapshots, but the real action is on the floor where MICKEY COHEN does a wicked "Lindy Hop" with THREE different GIRLS at once.  A fireplug of a man, he hardly seems a public menace.  Nearby is his bodyguard JOHNNY STOMPANATO.  Over it all: 
HUDGEONS (V.O.) Meyer Harris Cohen, Mickey C to his fans.  He's the big moocher, local L.A. color to the nth degree.  You know Mickey.  He runs dope, rackets and prostitution. He kills a dozen people a year. But who you may not know is bodyguard Johnny Stompanato. 
His hair in a slick pompadour, Stompanato keeps an eye on Cohen and comes onto a CIGARETTE GIRL at the same time. 
HUDGEONS (V.O.) Johnny's handsome, ladies, but the real attraction is below the belt. Second only to Steve Cochran, he's sometimes known as 'Oscar' because of his Academy Award-size appendage. 
Mickey works a sweat on the dance floor.  A bottle of champagne pops; Stompanato reacts, nearly draws a pistol from his shoulder holster.  As he laughs at himself... 
INT. HUSH-HUSH MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY 
Lurid page one headlines cover the wall where SID HUDGEONS types.  The essence of sleaze, Sid is the publisher-photographer-writer of Hush-Hush magazine and keeper of inside dirt supreme.  As he continues... 
HUDGEONS (V.O.) Remember, dear readers, you heard it here first, off the record, on the Q.T. and very Hush-Hush. 
INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT 
The party continues.  The Mayor has moved off to the side with the power brokers.  Patchett is a presence. 
MAYOR We're selling an image, gentlemen. Beautiful weather.  Affordable housing. (re:  model) Trouble-free transportation.  And the best police department in the world to keep it all running smoothly. 
EXT. STOREFRONT - NIGHT 
A dozen people watch a display windoe TELEVISION as it rolls the opening of the hit show "Badge of Honor."  Over familiar THEME MUSIC, "Sgt. Joe Reno" (actor BRETT CHASE) walks the streets of Los Angeles. 
CHASE (V.O.) My name?  Joe Reno.  The city? Los Angeles.  A big town.  Full of all sorts of people.  It's my job to help them.  I like what I do. I'm a cop. 
INT. HANCOCK PARK MANSION - BALLROOM - NIGHT 
The Mayor continues. 
MAYOR But with a second rate Al Capone out there, L.A. looks like Chicago in the '30s.  Something has to be done. 
As Pierce Patchett nods sagely. 
INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 
Wrestler GORGEOUS GEORGE primps and poses before flatten- ing an opponent with a drop kick. 
INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 
An enthusiastic crowd adjusts their 3-D glasses. 
EXT. COHEN MANSION (BEVERLY HILLS) - DAY 
In monogrammed silk pajamas, Mickey Cohen answers the door, his pet BULLDOG Mickey Jr. at his feet.  The police are waiting.  REPORTERS' flashbulbs pop. 
POLICE OFFICER Mr. Cohen, you're under arrest. 
COHEN Bullshit.  What's the charge? 
POLICE OFFICER Non-payment of federal income tax. 
COHEN Bullshit. 
JACK Two sets. 
ACTRESS I'll get my coat. 
They're interrupted by Sid Hudgeons. 
HUDGEONS Big V Jack Vincennes!  May I have this dance? 
JACK Karen, this is Sid Hudgeons from Hush-Hush magazine. 
ACTRESS I know who he is. 
The Actress storms off.  Jack looks to Sid. 
HUDGEONS We did a piece last year. 'Ingenue Dykes In Hollywood.'  Her name got mentioned. 
JACK Is she? 
HUDGEONS Beats me.  Look, Jackie-Boy, a friend of mine just sold some reefer to Matt Reynolds.  He's tripping the light fantastic with Tammy Jordan at 2245 Maravilla, Hollywood Hills.  It's right around the corner. 
JACK You lost me, Sid.  Who? 
HUDGEONS Contract players at Metro.  You pinch 'em.  I do you up feature in the next issue.  Plus the usual fifty cash.  Tell me, am I fucking Santa Claus? 
JACK I need an extra fifty.  Two patrolmen at twenty apiece and a dime for the watch commander at Hollywood Station. 
HUDGEONS Jack!  It's Christmas! 
JACK No.  It's felony possession of marijuana. 
EXT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT 
WITH a VIEW of Grauman's Chinese.  Jack and two uniformed patrolmen wait on the darkened street.  An arc light has been set up.  Hudgeons creeps back over from the house. 
HUDGEONS They're sitting in the dark, goofing on the Christmas tree. 
JACK Stand there with your camera. I'll stop here so you get Grauman's Chinese in the backgrouns. 
HUDGEONS I like it!  I like it! 
INT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT 
The arc light floods the living room about the same time that Jack kicks the door in.  The room is caught flush: Christmas tree, a bag of weed on the couch, two kids necking in their BVDs.  MATT REYNOLDS and TAMMY JORDAN. 
JACK Police! 
EXT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT 
Jack exits, hauling Jordan and Reynolds by the neck. Jack stops with Grauman's FRAMED behind him and Hudgeons CLICKS off several shots with his CAMERA. 
HUDGEONS Cut!  Wrap it! 
Windows light up.  Rubberneckers appear.  Jack hands the kids to the patrolmen, heads back in with Hudgeons in tow. 
INT. 2245 MARAVILLA - NIGHT 
Jack scoops the pot, flips through an address book.  A card falls out.  "Fleur-de-Lis.  Whatever you desire..." Jack looks from the card out the window at the kids being loaded into a black and white.  They're both crying now. 
HUDGEONS (stantorian tone) It's Christmas morning in the City of Angels, and while decent citizens sleep the sleep of the righteous, hopheads prowl for marijuana, not knowing that a man is coming to stop them.  The free- wheeling, big-time Big V, celebrity crime-stopper, Jack Vincennes, the scourge of grasshoppers and junk fiends everywhere.  You like it, Jackie- Boy? 
JACK Yeah, it's subtle. 
Sid hands him a President Grant 50. 
HUDGEONS Remember: you heard it first here, off the record, on the Q.T. and very Hush-Hush. 
INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT 
Suspects, mostly drunk and disorderly, are ushered through.  Sgt. ED EXLEY, 30, bespectacled, is at the desk with a YOUNG OFFICER.  Exley is an up-and-comer.  Burning with ambition.  The faster he rises through the ranks, the more resentment he leaves in his wake. 
EXLEY What's on the call sheet? 
YOUNG OFFICER A guy dressed as Santa has been exposing himself to kids in Los Feliz.  Apparently, sir, he's decorated himself. 
EXLEY Decorated? 
YOUNG OFFICER With tinsel and plastic icicles and... on his penis, sir. 
EXLEY I get the idea.  You got a description? 
YOUNG OFFICER Of his penis, sir? 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - HOLLYWOOD LIQUOR - NIGHT 
Tinsel-trimmed photos of movie stars look down from the walls as the OWNER takes an order from LYNN BRACKEN. 
LYNN A case each of gin, Scotch, and rum.  Everything top shelf.  None of that watered-down stuff you push on Errol Flynn. 
OWNER (laughs) Sounds like a helluva party. 
Her hair kerchiefed, Lynn waits as the Owner writes it up.  There's glamour, a cat-girl grace about Lynn.  She seems like she belongs up on the wall with the movie stars.  Lynn looks across as Bud White heads toward the counter.  Spotting her, Bud doesn't look so tough for a moment. 
OWNER You want it delivered? 
LYNN Before five tomorrow. 
The Owner spots Bud.  A big smile turns to a frown. 
Dudley's the last one out the door.  As he goes, he turns back to give the men a wink.  He's no sooner out the door when the first case of Johnny Walker is brought in. 
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - DISPATCH DESK - NIGHT 
Ed Exley gets another report from the Young Officer. 
YOUNG OFFICER Two police officers were assaulted in a bar.  Brown and Helenowski. 
He hands the report to Exley.  It's now that Dudley comes through on his press junket. 
DUDLEY This is Sergeant Ed Exley.  Son of the legendary Preston Exley.  He's the watch commander tonight and a damn fine job. 
As the photographer snaps Exley's picture... 
DUDLEY I was fortunate enough to be partnered with his father when I was a rookie.  It makes a man feel old.  That's a fact. (a beat) Feel free to get a feel for the place. 
As the Reporter and photographer wander off, Dudley turns to Exley a bit more serious. 
DUDLEY A word with you, lad. 
INT. DUDLEY SMITH'S OFFICE - DAY 
Dudley pours two drinks, hands one to Exley. 
DUDLEY To the memory of your father. 
They drink.  Exley looks to a photo on the wall. 
Himself as a ten-year-old standing between Dudley and his father Preston, both in police uniform. 
DUDLEY The day he got the Medal of Valor. A simpler time. 
Remembering, Exley invokes his father's favorite toast. 
EXLEY To the solving of crimes that require absolute justice. 
Exley raises his glass, but Dudley just watches him. 
DUDLEY That was his favorite toast. (a beat) I saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam.  You placed first out of twenty-three. 
EXLEY The youngest applicant by eight years. 
DUDLEY You'll make lieutenant inside a year.  Patrol division? 
EXLEY I was thinking Detective Bureau. 
We can see Dudley doesn't approve. 
DUDLEY You don't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective. Or the stomach.  You're a political animal, Edmund. 
The criticism stings, but Dudley's a straight shooter. 
EXLEY You're wrong. 
DUDLEY Am I...?  Would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment? 
EXLEY Dudley, we've been over this. 
DUDLEY Answer yes or no. 
EXLEY I... No. 
DUDLEY Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis...?  Yes or no, Edmund. 
EXLEY No. 
DUDLEY Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty? 
EXLEY No. 
DUDLEY Would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance -- 
EXLEY No. 
DUDLEY Then for God's sake, don't be a detective.  Stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices.  Patrol, Internal Affairs, but not the Bureau. 
EXLEY I know you mean well, Dudley, but I don't need to do it the way you did.  Or my father. 
DUDLEY At least get rid of the glasses. I can't think of one Bureau man who wears them. 
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - MUSTER ROOM - NIGHT 
A large impromptu bar has been set-up.  The party is in full swing, the floor packed with nightwatch blues.  A PHONOGRAPH SPEWS DIRTY CHRISTMAS CAROLS. 
Stensland pours eggnog and Old Crow into the water cooler as Bud elbows his way in with another case. 
STENSLAND Hey, partner.  Grab a cup. 
BUD I got to write my report first. 
PASSING COP #1 Hear about Helenowski and Brown? They got into a helluva scrap with six taco benders at some bar. Helenowski lost six pints of blood.  Brown's in a coma. 
PASSING COP #2 We ought to teach Paco and his friends a lesson. 
More cops vocie their agreement.  Bottles are passed. Only Bud doesn't seem as caught-up as the rest. 
INT. PRECINCT HOUSE - NARCO PEN - NIGHT 
EXLEY (V.O.) Let me out!  That's an order! 
CELL BLOCK 
The Herald Reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned and unnoticed.  Stensland swings like a madman.  That's when a flashbulb goes off.  Freezing everyone in black and white. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - DAY 
The CHIEF sits behind a desk in a four-star uniform. Dudley Smith sits to his left, D.A. Ellis Loew to his right.  Seen earlier at the Mickey Cohen press conference, Loew is the only civilian.  Bud White stands across from them.  There to be judged. 
CHIEF Officer White, you've refused to cooperate with Internal Affairs. But you should know this is bigger than a police board.  Indictments may be handed down.  Quite frankly, we need police witnesses to offset the damage done to the Department's image.  Will you testify? 
Bud glances to a gray tinted mirror, then to the Chief. 
BUD No, sir.  I won't. 
The Chief sighs, looks to Loew. 
CHIEF District Attorney Loew. 
Loew steps to Bud, holds up a newspaper with the cell block photo.  The headline:  "BLOODY CHRISTMAS." 
LOEW Bloody Christmas.  The press love to label.  You and Officer Stensland brought the liquor into the precinct.  Stensland was already drunk.  Do you see how appearing as a voluntary witness against him could offset the damage you've done to yourself? 
BUD I won't do it. (staring at mirror) I won't testify against my partner or anyone else. 
LOEW This man is a disgrace. 
CHIEF Your badge and gun, Officer. 
Bud sets them on The Chief's desk. 
CHIEF This is the new L.A.P.D., White. You're suspended from duty and dismissed. 
Turning, White shoots the mirror a stiff middle finger as he makes his way out.  Dudley Smith hides a smile. 
OTHER SIDE OF GLASS 
Exley watches, involuntarily leans back as Bud passes on the other side of the glass. 
THE CHIEF'S OFFICE 
Dudley, Loew and The Chief wait as Exley enters. 
CHIEF Ed, your observations have been astute.  What's your assessment of this situation? 
EXLEY The public demands justice, sir. This was a full-fledged riot of policemen.  Shift the guilt to men whose pensions are secured.  Force them to retire.  But someone has to swing.  Indict, try and convict Stensland and Bud White.  Secure them jail time.  Feed them to the sharks, sir.  Protect yourself; protect the department. 
Dudley gives Exley a look.  He's angry with him. 
DUDLEY Stensland's a disgrace.  Straight D fitness reports from every C.O. he ever served under.  But White is a valuable officer. 
EXLEY White's a mindless thug. 
DUDLEY No, Edmund.  He's a man who can answer yes to those questions I ask you from time to time. 
The Chief interrupts with his own concern. 
CHIEF I want to know who we give the public in contrast?  The department needs role models. Clean-cut, forthright men the public can admire. 
EXLEY I'll testify, sir.  I'm not afraid to do what's right. 
CHIEF And I'll promote you.  You'll be a lieutenant immediately. 
Exley seizes the moment, going over Dudley's head. 
EXLEY Detective lieutenant. 
The Chief and Dudley exchange a look.  Neither approves. 
CHIEF Ed, you're 30.  Your father didn't make lieutenant until he was 33. 
EXLEY I know that, sir.  I also know that when he made lieutenant, it was as a detective. 
LOEW (interrupting) Before we start polishing our laurels, it would look better if we had a corroborative witness. 
DUDLEY That'll be hard to come by.  The men hate a turncoat. 
EXLEY Jack Vincennes.  He's the technical advisor on 'Badge of Honor,' sir.  He lives for it. That's the way to get him. 
CHIEF All right, Ed. (into desk intercom) Call Sergeant Vincennes. 
As Exley starts out, Dudley pulls him aside, speaks low. 
DUDLEY You'll reap the benefits, but are you truly prepared to be despised within the department? 
EXLEY Yes, Dudley.  I am. 
DUDLEY So be it. 
JACK VINCENNES 
Looking sharp, he strides down the hall, enters the... 
CHIEF'S OFFICE 
BUD Captain, what do you want? 
DUDLEY Call me Dudley. 
BUD Dudley, what do you want? 
DUDLEY Lad, I admire your refusal to testify and your loyalty to your partner.  I admire you as a policeman, particularly your adherence to violence as a necessary adjutant to the job. And I am most impressed with your punishment of wife beaters.  Do you hate them, Wendell? 
BUD (looks away) Yeah, I hate them. 
DUDLEY And for good reason judging from what I know of your background. 
Bud looks back over.  Dudley's getting too personal. 
BUD What's going to happen to Stensland?  He'll give himself cirrhosis over this.  He's one year from his pension. 
DUDLEY It would've happened years ago if you hadn't carried him.  Why the loyalty, Wendell? 
BUD He helped me out once.  That's all. 
DUDLEY Your partner's through. Department scapegoat on the Chief's orders.  He's been billed, he'll be indicted and he'll swing. 
BUD Him and me both.  Fucking Exley. 
DUDLEY Don't underestimate his skills. As a politician he exceeds even myself.  But the department needs smart men like Exley and... direct men like yourself 
BUD What do you want? 
DUDLEY Wendell, I want you to come to work for me. 
BUD Doing what?  Mowing your fucking lawn? 
Smith yanks the newspaper revealing Bud's badge & .38 Special.  Bud can't believe his eyes. 
DUDLEY They're yours.  Take them. 
BUD I knew you had juice, but... There's no goddamn bill on me? 
DUDLEY Four of the defendants recanted their testimony. 
BUD How? 
Dudley dismisses the question with a wave of his hand. 
DUDLEY I need you for an assignment the Chief's given me the go-ahead on. A duty few men are fit for, but you were born for.  You'll be working out of Homicide. 
BUD (excited) Homicide?  A detective? 
CHIEF Your talents lie elsewhere, Wendell.  It's a muscle job and shooting job.  You'll do what I say and not ask questions.  Do you follow my drift? 
BUD (disappointed) In Technicolor. 
DUDLEY Will you work for me? 
BUD Of course... But how? 
DUDLEY How what, Wendell? 
BUD How'd you get them to retract? 
Dudley lays brass knuckles on the table.  They're chipped, caked with blood. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
L.A. MONTAGE 
Over the pop song "STRANGER IN PARADISE." 
A)  EXT. GRAUMAN'S CHINESE - NIGHT 
Frank Sinatra at the premiere of From Here to Eternity. 
B)  INT. KLUB ZAMBOANGA - NIGHT 
Charlie "Bird" Parker makes magic before an appreciative, mostly black crowd. 
C)  TORCH SONG TAVERN (RIVERSIDE) - NIGHT 
Nate Janklow exits with his latest flame.  A mob lieutenant, Nate was last seen with Mickey Cohen outside the Federal Courthouse in the opening montage.  A CAR SCREECHES up.  TWO GUNS aim and Nate and his date do down in a proverbial HAIL OF LEAD. 
D)  EXT. FREEWAY - DAY 
A groundbreaking.  The Mayor scrapes at the ground with a gold shovel.  Pierce Patchett is among the distinguished guests. 
END OF MONTAGE 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
The marquee gushes:  "Today Sgt. Joe Reno:  Badge of Honor Star Brett Chase." 
INT. HOLLYWOOD HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY 
A nerdy 14-YEAR-OLD asks Brett Chase: 
14-YEAR-OLD Why'd you become a policeman? 
CHASE I'm not a policeman.  I just play one on television.  But I think I can answer for them.  To help people.  That's why I do the show. 
VICE CAPTAIN They're yours.  Make a major case, Sergeant.  It's the only way you're getting out of here. 
Exaggerated "oohs" and "aahs" from the men. 
VICE CAPTAIN Dismissed, gentlemen. 
As they go, Jack sees the books are stamped:  "Fleur-de-Lis Whatever you desire."  Jack takes the matching business card from his wallet, the one he found on Christmas Eve. 
VICE CAPTAIN Roll, Vincennes.  No sidetracks. This is Ad Vice, not Narco. 
INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - NARCO PEN - DAY 
Jack Vincennes is at his desk.  Holding the Fleur-de-Lis card, magazines spread before him, Jack dials the number. 
INT. HUSH-HUSH MAGAZINE OFFICE - DAY 
Sid Hudgeons sits behind his desk, answers the phone. 
HUDGEONS Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on the Q.T. 
JACK (V.O.) Sid, it's Vincennes. 
HUDGEONS Jackie, are you back on Narco?  I need copy. 
INTERCUT WITH Jack at his desk: 
JACK No.  But I've got something going with Ad Vice. 
HUDGEONS Something good? 
JACK Don't know.  I'm chasing picture books.  Fuck shots, but the posers don't look like junkies.  It's well done stuff.  I thought you might have heard something. 
Hudgeons reaches into a stack of papers, pulls out a magazine like the one Jack has. 
HUDGEONS Not a word. 
JACK What about Fleur-de-Lis?  Their slogan's 'Whatever you desire.' 
HUDGEONS No.  No, I've heard bupkis.  Jack, I'll talk to you later.  Call me when you get something I can use. Smut's from hunger.  For sad sacks who can't get their ashes hauled 
The LINE CLICKS off.  Jack hesitates a moment before cradling the receiver.  Something's not right here. 
EXT. HOLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - TWILIGHT 
As Exley pulls in, his two-way drones: 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) Park Rangers report three Negro youths discharging shotguns into the air in Griffith Park. Suspects are driving a late model purple Mercury Coupe. 
As the report ends, Exley switches off the two-way and gets out of his car. 
INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT 
Accompanied by Bud, Dick Stensland crams the contents of his desk into a box.  Well-wishing cops pat him on the back, offer words of encouragement, but Stensland looks like he's going to cry. 
It's very bad timing as Exley enters, comes face-to-face with them.  This is hatred. 
Acting on impulse, Bud goes after Exley.  It's a mauling. Four vicious body shots.  A potentially lethal head shot sails wide as Exley falls to the ground. 
As four men move to hold Bud back, Exley looks up at him. 
EXLEY (gasping) You're just a thug, White.  That's all you'll ever be. 
Dudley steps into the fray.  He helps Exley to his feet. 
DUDLEY You should stay away from a man when his blood is up. 
EXLEY His blood's always up. 
Four cops are genuinely having trouble holding Bud back. Dudley watches with something bordering on admiration. 
DUDLEY Then maybe you should stay away from him all the time. 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Accompanied by Bud, Stensland reaches his car, loads his box of stuff into the trunk.  Bud is moody, pensive. 
STENSLAND Don't look so down in the mouth, Bud.  You nailed him good. 
BUD Yeah, sure... I got a couple of hours before I have to be at the Victory.  Want to grab a beer? 
STENSLAND Rain check me, partner.  I got something big going on tonight. 
BUD What?  That new mystery girl you've been seeing? 
STENSLAND No.  I'll tell you sometime.  Not now.  Don't want to jinx it.  But it could take the edge off that jail time I got coming. 
BUD What are you talking about? 
STENSLAND It's confidential, Bud.  Like that magazines Vincennes scams for. Hush-Hush. (smiles) I'll see you tomorrow.  And hey, if it works out, you'll get a piece of it. 
Stensland gets in the car, drives off.  Bud is left alone. 
INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT 
Exley sits alone in a sea of desks.  The SQUAWK BOX DRONES.  Exley squints at the clock on the wall, can't make it out.  He takes his glasses from the inside of his jacket.  2:00 A.M.  Finally, something to do.  He walks to the wall calendar, tears off Feb. 28 to reveal Mar. 1. 
As Exley sits, the call SQUAWK BOX booms to life. 
Dudley turns to Exley. 
DUDLEY Mr. Sifakis is a known loan shark from San Francisco.  He arrived this afternoon at Union Station. Looking for business opportunities in our fair city.  An organized crime associate in need of re- education in the ways of polite society. 
Uncuffed, Flatnose rubs his wrists.  Wary.  As Breuning steps back, Flatnose snatches the .45 off the table. 
FLATNOSE Motherfuckers! 
Exley dives for cover, but the other four cops just stand there.  Dudley looks down on the floor at Exley. 
DUDLEY It's part of the play, Edmund.  A sincerity test. 
Flatnose looks at the gun a beat, then squeezes the TRIGGER.  CLICK CLICK.  No bullets. 
DUDLEY (to Breuning) Sit him back down. 
CLICK, CLICK.  They shove Flatnose back in the hot seat. Dudley offers a hand to Exley, helps him to his feet. 
DUDLEY Wendell, you need to accompany Detective Lieutenant Exley on official police business.  I'll finish up here. 
INT. EXLEY'S PLYMOUTH - DAY 
They drive in silence.  No love lost here.  Finally. 
BUD Where are we going? 
EXLEY It's a surprise.  You like surprises, don't you, White? 
EXT. COUNTY MORGUE - DAY 
Exley pulls up.  Bud looks to him.  Really curious now. 
INT. COUNTY MORGUE - HALLWAY - DAY 
Exley and Bud walk.  An orderly wheels a covered corpse toward them from the other end of the hall.  Bud's spooked.  The orderly wheels the body in to the examination room. 
As Bud and Exley pass, the CORONER pulls back the sheet, is surprised at the sight of a woman who we don't quite see. 
CORONER Call me crazy, but for a second I thought it was Rita Hayworth. 
MORGUE MEAT LOCKER 
Exley and Bud walk past a wall of drawers to where a coroner's assistant waits. 
EXLEY We need you to I.D. the body. There's no next of kin and you knew him best.  So tell me... 
The assistant pulls open drawer 12.  A naked man. 
A tag on his toe and half his face blown off. 
EXLEY Is that Dick Stensland? 
Stunned, Bud stares at what's left of his old partner. 
BUD Yeah, that's Stens. 
EXLEY Hell of a way to avoid a prison sentence. 
Bud's torn between wanting to smash Exley and finding out why Stensland is dead.  He squeezes out the words. 
BUD What happened? 
EXLEY Someone held up a coffee shop, panicked and killed six people. 
Then, from the hall... 
WOMAN (O.S.) Not my baby!  Not my little girl! 
INT. COUNTY MORGUE - EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY 
HILDA LEFFERTS, 50, enters with the coroner to ID the body of her daughter, Susan. 
There's stray buckshot in the upper chest and shoulders, but a sheet hides the real damage.  It's the girl Bud saw outside Hollywood Liquor.  Without the black eyes, she does look like Rita hayworth. 
As Bud and Exley appear, Mrs. Lefferts looks confused. 
CORONER Is this your daughter, Mrs. Lefferts? 
MRS. LEFFERTS I -- I don't know. 
EXLEY We know this is difficult.  Just take your time and look again. 
Exley doesn't realize, but Bud recognizes the deceased. 
MRS. LEFFERTS It seems like my Susan, but... 
EXLEY When was the last time you saw her, Mrs. Lefferts? 
MRS. LEFFERTS At Christmas.  We had fought.  I didn't like her boyfriend.  I -- she has a birthmark on her hip. 
The Coroner lifts the sheet.  Mrs. Lefferts gasps. 
MRS. LEFFERTS It's her.  My baby.  Dear God... 
As Mrs. Lefferts swoons, Bud and Exley both hold her up. 
INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY 
BUD You fuck for money. 
LYNN There's blood on your shirt.  Is that an integral part of your job? 
BUD Yeah. 
LYNN Do you enjoy it? 
BUD When they deserve it. 
LYNN Did they deserve it today? 
BUD I'm not sure. 
LYNN But you did it anyway. 
BUD Yeah, just like the half dozen guys you screwed today. 
LYNN (laughs again) Actually, it was two.  You're different, Officer White.  You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute. 
BUD You look better than Veronica Lake.  Now, Pierce Patchett. 
LYNN He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us.  He makes us quit the life at thirty.  He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us.  Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions? 
BUD He had you cut to look like Veronica Lake? 
LYNN No.  I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me.  And that's all the news that's fit to print. 
Lynn starts toward the door.  Bud watches her a moment, then follows.  She takes his glass at the door. 
LYNN It was nice meeting you, Officer. 
Out the door, Bud turns back.  Blurts: 
BUD Look.  I want to see you again. 
LYNN Are you asking me for a date or an appointment? 
BUD (suddenly unsure) I don't know. 
LYNN (another smile) If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I -- 
BUD (feeling foolish) Forget I asked.  It was a mistake. 
Lynn watches thoughtfully after Bud as he walks away. He opens his car door like he's going to tear ir off. A last glance back at Lynn and as he gets in the car... 
EXT. TEVERE HOTEL - DAY 
An L-shaped walk-up.  Jack coasts the car to the curb. He leaps out with Exley.  Exley holds up at the sight of a late model sedan.  He leans down to look in the window at the two-way on the dash. 
EXLEY L.A.P.D. 
JACK Shit.  Someone beat us here. 
VOICES from the carport ahead.  We see a chrome bumper, the purple fender of a '49 Mercury coupe.  A door slams. Drawing a .45, Jack starts over with Exley, .38 in hand. 
CARPORT 
Toting shotguns, Dudley's boys from the Victory Motel, Breuning and Carlisle, stand by the purple Mercury.  Jack and Exley come around the corner, lower their guns. 
JACK Hey. 
Breuning wheels, pumps a round into the chamber.  He very nearly fires before he sees who it is. 
CARLISLE What the fuck are you guys doing here? 
EXLEY Think of us as back-up. 
JACK What do you got? 
As Jack moves to peer through the Merc's window. 
BREUNING Three Ithaca pumps, an empty box of double-ought buck and cash. 
Jack spots them.  Three shotguns on the passenger side floor, an empty box of shells and loose dollar bills. 
JACK So long, Vice.  Badge of Honor, here I come. 
CARLISLE Fuck you, Vincennes.  It's our collar. 
Breuning actually has to restrain his partner. 
EXLEY Quiet.  I'm ranking officer here. We go as a team.  End of story. 
INT. CORRIDOR - TEVERE HOTEL - DAY 
Breuning and Carlisle lead the way with Jack and Exley bringing up the rear.  Squinting, Exley reaches to his pocket for something.  Not there. 
EXLEY Damnit... 
JACK What? 
EXLEY Glasses. 
JACK (chuckling) Just don't shoot me. 
The door to 414.  Two men on either side.  Breuning rears back.  Jack rears back.  They kick at the same instant. The door flies off its hinges to reveal two young black men, LARRY FONTAINE and TY JONES, waking from a couple of flop mattresses. 
COATES Man, what're you saying? 
EXLEY Ray, we got the shotguns. 
COATES I don't own no shotguns. 
EXLEY Why were you throwing clothes in the building incinerator? 
COATES (trembling) Say what? 
EXLEY You guys were arrested this morning, but none of you have last night's clothes.  You were seen burning them.  Add to that the fact that you hid the car you were cruising around in last night and it doesn't look good. 
COATES I got nothin' more to say till I see a judge. 
EXLEY Were you on hop?  You were passed out when you got arrested.  Were you hopped up, Ray? 
COATES Ty and Larry fuck with that shit, not me. 
EXLEY Where do they get their stuff? Come on.  Give me one to feed the D.A.  Just a little one. 
Coates nods.  Exley flips up the toggles as he leans in. 
COATES Roland Navarette.  Lives on Bunker Hill.  He runs a hole-up for parole absconders and sells red devils. 
Exley flips down the switches, stands. 
EXLEY I'm going to take a break. 
Exley opens the door, looks back in afterthought. 
EXLEY You know, Ray, I'm talking about the gas chamber and you haven't even asked me what this is all about.  You got a big guilty sign around your neck. 
Exley exits. 
OBSERVATION ROOM 
Exley enters. 
DUDLEY Masterful, Edmund.  Your father would've been proud. (pointing) This one's on the verge. 
Exley looks through the glass into #2.  Larry Fontaine is weeping.  A piss puddle on the floor by his chair. 
EXLEY Fontaine next, but give Jones the newspaper.  I want him primed. 
#2 ROOM 
Fontaine tries to control his sniffles as Exley enters. 
EXLEY Larry, Ray Coates ratted you off.  He said the Nite Owl was your idea.  You want to tell me about it? 
No answer. 
EXLEY I think it was Ray's idea.  Talk and I think I can save your life. 
No answer. 
EXLEY Larry, this is a gas chamber job. If you don't talk, you'll be dead in six months. 
No answer. 
EXLEY Son, six people are dead and somebody has to pay.  It can be you or it can be Ray. 
No answer. 
EXLEY Larry, he called you queer.  He said at Casitas you took it up the ass.  He said -- 
FONTAINE I DIDN'T KILL NOBODY! 
The voice is strong, full of conviction.  Exley glances at the mirror.  Then... 
EXLEY Why'd you burn the clothes? 
FONTAINE (sobbing) I just wanted to lose my cherry. I didn't mean to hurt her. 
Exley can't hide his surprise at this. 
EXLEY Hurt who?  Was she a hooker? Hurt who? 
But Fontaine is gone.  Head lolling, eyes squeezing out tears. 
OBSERVATION ROOM 
Exley steps out of the interrogation room.  Dudley braces him. 
DUDLEY Don't get sidetracked.  Stay with the Nite Owl. 
EXLEY She may still be alive, whoever she is. 
Bud's all ears. 
#3 ROOM 
Reading, Jones has his feet on the table.  Exley bursts in. 
JONES This newspaper shit ain't shit. 
EXLEY Where's the girl?  Did you kill her? 
In the back, Bud stays sprawled in his seat.  No one's watching as he takes out his gun, kisses it, and blows pretend smoke off the barrel.  As the song ends... 
INT. VARIETY INTERNATIONAL PICTURES - STAGE 4 - NIGHT 
A "Badge of Honor" fund-raiser for D.A. Loew's re- election cmpaign.  Hot dogs and sauerkraut.  Fishbowls stuffed with cash.  Jack is here, returns a smile half- heartedly.  Loew sits with his wife and teenage daughter as Brett "Joe Reno" Chase speaks. 
CHASE This election is about the future of law enforcement in Los Angeles. Ellis Loew represents that future. So dig deep and let's get a moral man re-elected. 
Applause.  Leaving the podium, Chase smiles at Ellis Loew's daughter who absolutely gushes.  Chase then winks knowingly to Jack who returns a tired, humorless smile. 
Jack scans the room.  An odd moment as Jack catches his own reflection in a mirror across the way.  He puts a hand to his face.  Is that him? 
HUDGEON (O.S.) Big V Jack Vincennes! 
Jack turns to see Sid Hudgeons approaching. 
HUDGEONS You're back, boychick. 
JACK Sid, how are they hanging? 
HUDGEONS Down around my ankles. 
Hudgeons scans the crowd, points someone out. 
HUDGEONS You remember Matt Reynolds? 
Jack spots Matt Reynolds -- one of the young actors Jack arrested on Christmas Eve. 
HUDGEONS The Grauman's Chinese pot bust. He just got off the honor farm. 
JACK What's he doing here, Sid? 
HUDGEONS You tight with the D.A., trash? 
JACK Sure, he just tried to throw me off the force last Christmas as a little joke. 
HUDGEONS How'd you like a little payback? Not to mention a donation to the widows and orphans fund.  Did you know Loew was a swish? 
JACK And Reynolds? 
HUDGEONS He's queer too.  Metro paid him two grand a week to fake it with ingenues.  On screen and off.  I'm getting him to fuck the D.A. for a hundred bucks. (winks) That's twice the fifty you got for wrecking his career. 
Even Jack's not immune to a comment like that. 
HUDGEONS Matt!  Over here! 
As Hudgeons heads over, Hudgeons points out... 
HUDGEONS That's D.A. Loew right there. 
Reynolds gets a nervous bead on Loew.  Hudgeons realizes: 
HUDGEONS You need a drink, kid... Jack, look after him a minute.  Kid, this is Jack.  No secrets between me and him. 
Hudgeons heads off.  Reynolds, plae, nods at Jack. 
REYNOLDS Have we met before? 
JACK Yeah. 
Jack doesn't really feel like talking to him.  Reynolds' nerves won't let him stay quiet. 
REYNOLDS Was it a party? 
JACK Something like that. 
REYNOLDS (misreading) Oh, I know.  A Fleur-de-Lis party, right? 
Jack remembers the name, plays along for what it's worth. 
JACK Fleaur-de-Lis.  'Whatever you desire.' 
REYNOLDS Dope, liquor, hookers that look like movie stars.  Pierce Patchett has it all. 
Jack recognizes the name, bluffs for more information. 
JACK Yeah.  Me and Patchett go way back. 
REYNOLDS Pierce isn't like regular people. I dig him, but he scares me too. 
JACK Really?  How? 
REYNOLDS (shakes his head) You know, when I came out to L.A., this isn't exactly where I saw myself ending up. 
JACK Yeah.  Me neither. 
Reynolds looks like he's going to cry.  Hudgeons returns with a double Scotch straight up and a hot dog with sauerkraut.  He hands the drink to Matt. 
HUDGEONS Dutch courage, kid.  Drink up. 
Reynolds downs a few gulps, looks across the room at Loew. 
REYNOLDS I don't know if I should do this. 
HUDGEONS Hey, it's not like you don't know how.  And Jack here has connections on 'Badge of Honor.' Pull this off and there'll be a part for you.  I smell a comeback. Don't you, Jack? 
Reynolds looks to Jack who gives a noncommittal shrug. 
Jack decides.  MOVE WITH him as he gets out and crosses the street.  The apartment is dark, the front door a few inches ajar.  Suspicious, Jack listens.  Dead quiet.  He enters... 
INT. 5261 CHERAMOYA AVENUE - NIGHT 
No one here it seems.  Till Jack nearly trips over a body.  Matt Reynolds.  Soaked in blood.  Throat slit. Jack looks down in horror as Reynolds seems to stare back up at him.  Jack stumbles out the door.  We hear his CAR DOOR SLAM shut, the SCREECH of RUBBER down the street. 
EXT. 2345 HALBORO (HUDGEONS' HOUSE) - NIGHT 
Jack pounds on Sid's door till lights switch on. 
JACK It's Vincennes!  Open up! 
Hudgeons opens the door.  He's in his pajamas. 
HUDGEONS Jackie!  You got some good scoop for the Sidster? 
JACK Sid, cut the crap.  I -- 
HUDGEONS Give me some Narco skinny.  I want to put out an all hop-head issue. Shvartze jazz musicians and movie stars.  Maybe tie it into the Rosenbergs.  You like? 
Jack grabs him, jerks him into the door frame. 
JACK Shut up! 
HUDGEONS (confused) What's wrong, Trash? 
HUDGEONS What happened with the kid and Loew? 
HUDGEONS You didn't get my message?  It got called off.  The kid chickened out at the last minute. 
JACK He's dead.  I was just there. Somebody slit his throat. 
HUDGEONS Jesus.  Jack, that's a story. 'Swish Actor Gets The Gay Blade.' Let me get my camera. 
Hudgeons starts away, but Jack grabs him. 
JACK Loew didn't go with him.  You're sure? 
HUDGEONS I put Reynolds in the cab myself. The night cost me a hundred scoots and I got bupkis. 
Jack lets go of him, starts to ramble off into the night. 
HUDGEONS Jackie!  Big V!  Let me get my camera!  Where are you going?! 
INT. AFTER HOURS CLUB - NIGHT 
The BARTENDER walks down the bar to where Jack arrives. 
BARTENDER What'll it be, Jack? 
JACK (pulls out wallet) A bottle of Scotch. 
As the Bartender turns for one, the only bill Jack finds is the President Grant fifty.  The things he's done for fifty bucks... As he looks up with despair at his reflection in the bar mirror, the Bartneder sets down a bottle and shot glass.  He plucks the fifty from Jack's hand. 
Jack grabs the bottle and starts out. 
BARTENDER Hey!  Your change! 
INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Spent, Bud and Lynn lie in bed.  SHe traces a finger over his bicep as he muses on the ceiling. 
BUD Who was that guy who was here earlier? 
Lynn's tracing finger stops on Bud's shoulder -- a small white scar. 
LYNN It doesn't matter.  All they get is Veronica Lake.  You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken... (re: scar) Where'd this come from? 
BUD When I was ten, my old man threw a bottle at my mother.  I guess I got in the way. 
LYNN So you saved her. 
BUD Yeah.  But not for long. 
Bud looks away.  Lynn sees he doesn't want to talk about it. 
LYNN Do you like being a cop, Bud? 
BUD I used to.  What I do now is strong-arm.  Sitting duck stuff... No, I don't like it.  If I could work Homicide like a real detective... 
Lynn listens sympathetically.  Bud's opening up. 
BUD There's something wrong with the Nite Owl.  That prick Exley shot the wrong guys.  But they made him a hero and whoever killed my partner is still out there. 
Frustrated, Bud pokes at his own chest. 
BUD In here I know it.  But I can't prove it.  I'm not a detective. I'm not smart enough.  I'm just the guy they bring in to scare the other guy shitless. 
Bud looks away, embarrassed to have shown so much of himself.  Lynn reaches over, turns his face back to her. 
LYNN You found Patchett.  You found me. You're smart enough.  Be a detective if that's what you want. 
BUD That simple, huh? 
Lynn nods.  That simple. 
INT. HOLLYWOOD STATION - EXLEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
JACK Okay, college boy, I'll help you. But I want half the collar. 
EXLEY A third.  I don't think we can make a case without Bud White. 
EXT. BROWN DERBY - DAY 
A Packard pulls up out front.  Bud gets out, heads inside.  Another car pulls up across the street. 
CLOSE ON JACK 
Watching Bud.  Jack gets out, starts across the street. 
INT. BROWN DERBY - BAR - DAY 
At the bar, Johnny Stompanato looks over as Bud joins him.  Stompanato isn't happy about it, but he smiles anyway. 
STOMPANATO Wendell White, how's tricks, paesano? 
BUD I ain't your paesano, you wop cocksucker. 
Nervous, Johnny taps his pinkie ring on a bottle of beer. 
STOMPANATO What do you want, officer? 
BUD You remember an ex-cop named Buzz Meeks?  He works for a guy named Patchett. 
Johnny taps his ring harder.  The bottle almost tips. 
STOMPANATO Should I? 
BUD His file listed you as a known associate.  Now spill. 
STOMPANATO Oh, yeah.  That was a long time ago.  Before your day.  The last few years he's been muscle for hire.  But I heard he's disappeared. 
BUD More. 
STOMPANATO More's gonna cost you. 
Bud's hand flashes out, grabs Stompanato by the crotch. 
BUD How 'bout I give you your balls back? 
STOMPANATO (in considerable pain) Before Meeks disappeared he was popping off about trying to move eighteen pounds of heroin. 
BUD Bullshit.  Where would a two-bit ex-cop get 18 pounds of heroin? 
STOMPANATO Deuce Perkins.  Mickey C's narcotics lieutenant.  The night he got clipped, eighteen pounds of Mickey's heroin went missing. 
Bud loosens his grip.  Stompanato gasps for air. 
DOOR 
Jack peels in, catches a glimpse of Bud and Stompanato. Too far away too hear anything, Jack quickly ducks out. 
BAR 
Stompanato's recovering. 
STOMPANATO Meeks is probably in Rio or someplace like that by now. 
BUD He's under a tract house in San Berdoo.  And he don't smell too good.  What happened to the heroin, Johnny? 
STOMPANATO I don't know.  I swear it! 
Bud starts to raise a hand.  Stompanato cringes, but Bud just slaps a twenty down on the bar and goes. 
INT. BROWN DERBY - PHONE BOOTH - DAY 
Jack's on the phone to Exley. 
JACK He's in the Brown Derby with Johnny Stompanato. (sees Bud exit) Check that.  I gotta go. 
EXT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY 
Jack pulls up, sees Bud knock on the front door.  It opens and Bud steps in.  Jack doesn't see who opens it. 
EXT. BUSHES - 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN BRACKEN'S) - DAY 
LEAVES RUSTLE.  There's movement in the underbrush.  Jack appears, followed by Exley.  Jack pulls a gun as they near a window. 
EXLEY What's that for? 
JACK Bud White.  He sees us and we're dead. 
They press up to the glass for a partial view.  Bud White sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet. Jack and Exley exchange a long, curious look.  This isn't the Bud White they're used to.  A pair of woman's hands take Bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin. 
The woman, Lynn Bracken, leans forward to kiss her policeman.  It may have been a long day, but she's every inch Veronica Lake.  Only the hair's not over her eye. 
They stand, kiss again.  Lynn's gown spills down around her ankles.  Bud scoops Lynn into his arms and the two of them disappear into a bedroom.  A long beat before... 
JACK Jesus... Maybe White's not so dumb after all. 
EXLEY Rita Hayworth at the morgue and now Veronica Lake with White. What the hell's going on? 
JACK Movie star hookers.  Whatever you desire... It's Fleur-fr-Lis again. 
EXLEY What's Fleur-de-Lis? 
JACK Guy's as cool as they come. 
A call CRACKLES in over Exley's RADIO.  Exley picks up. 
EXLEY This is Exley. 
DISPATCHER (V.O.) Ray Pinker wants to talk to you, Lieutenant.  Says he has your I.D. 
EXLEY Tell him Sergeant Vincennes is coming in to talk to him. 
JACK What are you going to do? 
EXLEY I'm going to Lynn Bracken's.  I'll meet you at the Dining Car. 
JACK Great.  You get the girl, I get the coroner. 
INT. LIBRARY (1184 GRETNA GREEN) - NIGHT 
Watching Exley and Vincennes from the window, Patchett picks up the phone, dials. 
HUDGEONS (V.O.) (over phone) Hush-Hush.  Off the record and on the Q.T. 
INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
KNOCKING on the door.  Lynn answers to reveal Exley. 
EXLEY Miss Bracken, I'm Lieutenant Exley. 
LYNN I know who you are.  You're the policeman Bud told me about. 
EXLEY Really?  What did White say? 
LYNN He said you were smart.  He also said you were competing with your dead father.  How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost. 
Exley lets it pass.  As he enters... 
EXLEY Let's concentrate on my smarts. Pierce Patchett made you, didn't he?  He taught you how to dress and talk and think and I am very impressed with the results.  But I need some answers and if I don't get them, I'm going to take you and Patchett down. 
LYNN He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you.  And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink? 
Exley can't help but smile.  Lynn smiles back. 
EXLEY Scotch. 
Exley watches her as she steps over to fix the drinks. 
LYNN I'm curious about you. 
EXLEY Why? 
She hands him his drink. 
LYNN Because Bud hates you more than he loves me. 
Exley stews.  Lynn watches him over the rim of her glass. 
LYNN It galls you that I know so much about you.  You don't have information to compete. 
EXLEY Don't underestimate me, Miss Bracken. 
LYNN The way you've underestimated Bud White? 
Exley's had it.  A menacing step forward.  Lynn's smile becomes a laugh.  Lost to himself, Exley leans in and kisses her.  Lynn pulls back, then kisses back.  In a beat, they're rolling to the floor, shedding clothes. 
As they trash the furniture, Lynn looks over his shoulder at her own reflection in a closet door mirror. 
REVERSE ANGLE - INSIDE CLOSET 
Two-way glass.  Sid Hudgeons is in here SNAPPING pictures.  As Lynn and Exley continue with their frantic lovemaking... 
INT. FORENSIC LAB - NIGHT 
Ray Pinker rubs his tired eyes. 
PINKER God bless dental records.  Stiff used to be a cop.  Turner Meeks. 
JACK Buzz Meeks? 
PINKER You knew him? 
JACK Of him.  He was around when I first joined the force.  A bad egg. 
Pinker could care less.  As Jack's wheels turn... 
INT. LAPD - RECORDS ROOM - NIGHT 
Jack searches dusty filing cabinets with dates like 1939 and 1940.  Reading one headed "Meeks," Jack lets out a low whistle.  He's found something. 
INT. PACIFIC DINING CAR - NIGHT 
Jack waits at the bar, watches the door anxiously. 
JACK Come on, Exley.  Where are you? 
INT. 1736 NOTTINGHAM (LYNN'S) - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Spent, Exley and Lynn sit, half-dressed, on the floor. They're quiet.  Then, through a smile: 
Jack shakes his head.  Dudley raises a REVOLVER.  He FIRES it at point-blank range, right into Jack's heart. Jack hits the floor, his cheek pressed flat on the linoleum. 
Jack opens his mouth to speak.  His lips form the words, but no sound comes out.  Dudley crouches down beside him. 
JACK Have you a valediction, lad? 
Dudley leans low, gives Jack an ear.  As he dies... 
JACK Rollo Tomasi... 
Dudley frowns in ignorance at the name. 
INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY 
Nothing mobilizes the police like losing one of their own.  Dudley is at the podium along with Exley.  Dozens of detectives take notes, including Bud White. 
DUDLEY Sergeant Vincennes' body was found in Echo Park at ten o'clock this morning.  Killed by a single .38 round to the heart.  One of our own, gentlemen.  We cannot tolerate it.  Justice must be swift and merciless.  That's all. 
As the men move odd, Dudley approaches Exley. 
DUDLEY Edmund, a word with you.  We received a tip this morning.  Did Vincennes ever mention the name Rollo Tomasi? 
Exley tries to look like he's thinking as Jack calls from the grave.  Screaming the name Dudley! 
EXLEY No... Where'd the tip come from? 
DUDLEY Anonymous.  Probably nothing. 
As Dudley moves off, Exley watches him go.  Scared. 
INT. LAPD HEADQUARTERS - BUD WHITE'S DESK - DAY 
Bud looks over as Dudley sits down across from him. 
DUDLEY You're perplexing to me these days, Wendell.  You're not your old, cruel self anymore.  I need proof that the extracurricular work I had planned for you remains within your grasp. 
BUD What work? 
DUDLEY I've long been involved in containing hard crime in such a way that myself and a few colleagues might someday enjoy a profit dispensation.  That day will soon be here and you'll share handsomely.  Grand means will be in our hands, Wendell. (MORE) 
DUDLEY (CONT'D) Imagine crime limited to the criminal element who perpetrate it. Imagine the means to keep the nigger filth sedated.  But don't stop there.  Extrapolate.  Imagine the police in control.  It's big, lad. 
BUD You lost me, Dudley.  I don't know what you're talking about. 
DUDLEY You have your extracurricular secrets, I have mine.  We'll hold a clarification session soon.  For now, I need your fearsome old habits at the Victory Motel. We're going to brace a man who may know who killed Jack Vincennes. Can I count on you? 
BUD Sure, boss.  Sure you can. 
INT. FORENSICS LAB - DAY 
Pinker looks up as Exley enters. 
EXLEY I want to know what you and Jack Vincennes talked about last night. Anything and everything.  Start with the I.D. on the corpse. 
A put-upon Pinker sighs. 
PINKER An ex-cop.  Buzz Meeks.  I pulled his police academy photo. 
Pinker goes to his desk for a twenty-year-old photo of Meeks.  he hands it to Exley, whose wheels are turning. 
EXLEY We got a dead ex-cop and a girl who looks like Rita Hayworth at the Nite Owl.  Another dead ex-cop under the house of Rita's mother. It's not a good week for ex-cops. 
PINKER I got Vincennes in the next room. It's not a good week for cops in general. 
EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - DAY 
A RAIN STORM has turned the courtyard into a mud bath. As usual, a light burns in room six.  Bud White parks alongside the other cars already here.  He makes a dash for the door. 
INT. VICTORY MOTEL - ROOM SIX - DAY 
Sid Hudgeons is cuffed to the hot seat.  Dudley sits across from him.  Dudley's henchman Breuning looms.  Bud enters. 
DUDLEY This is Mr. Hudgeons, Wendell. 
HUDGEONS I'm happy to cooperate.  You don't need to tie me down. 
DUDLEY It's for your own safety.  Now what can you tell us about Sergeant John Vincennes? 
HUDGEONS Trashcan Jack.  The Big V.  I can tell you he's on the Night Train to the big adios. 
Breuning cuffs Hudgeons in the side of the head. 
HUDGEONS Take it easy!  I didn't have anything to do with him getting killed if that's what you mean. 
DUDLEY But you were business associates? 
HUDGEONS What does that have to do -- 
Breuning cuffs him again. 
HUDGEONS Okay so we worked together.  It was an information exchange.  I got him first class collars and he got me good stories.  We were friends for Chrissakes! 
DUDLEY Alright.  We'll drop that line for now.  Next topic.  Please comment on Pierce Patchett. 
Bud looks over at mention of the name. 
HUDGEONS You think he had something to do with Vincennes getting iced? 
More lightning.  Lynn looks God-awful sad. 
LYNN Come in out of the rain, Bud. 
BUD You gonna tell me what happened with you and Exley? 
LYNN We talked. 
BUD So tell me about it. 
LYNN (looking away) In the morning. 
BUD No.  Now. (a beat) You fucked him. 
Too tired to lie anymore, Lynn finally just nods. 
LYNN I thought I was helping you.  I thought -- 
Bud backhands her, hard.  Lynn faces straight into the next one as Bud hits her again.  A third time as the sins of the father are visited on the son.  Bud stops short as the self-realization slams home.  Lynn waits stoically. She doesn't start crying till Bud turns and runs back into the rain. 
INT. RECORDS ROOM - LAPD - DAY 
Drawers are open.  Files are everywhere.  Exley's reached the end of the line.  As he looks through one last file, he finds a stack of official photos.  Then he stops short.  There's a photo of four cadets and an academy instructor. 
Two of the cadets are IDed as Turner Meeks and Dick Stensland.  The instructor is Dudley Smith! 
Exley looks up at the sound of FOOTSTEPS and Bud is there.  Fury.  He slams Exley, knocks him flat. 
Bud's here to kill him.  He hauls Exley up, pummels him, then throws him over the table.  Then up into a wall. Plaster cracks.  Bud's on some gonzo animal plane.  Bud strangles him.  Exley gags.  It'll be over in moments. 
Until Exley's flailing hands finds Bud's .38.  Yanking it from his waistband, Exley smashes Bud in the forehead. Bud reels.  But, blind with rage, he moves back in only to have the barrel of the .38 placed right between his eyes. 
EXLEY Why? 
BUD Lynn. 
EXLEY She told you? 
Bud shakes his head.  He's coiled, ready to make a move. 
EXLEY Who told you?  Did Dudley have anything to do with you finding out? 
Bud hesitates, the answer obvious. 
EXLEY Listen to me.  Dudley killed Jack. It has something to do with Buzz Meeks. 
Exley points out the academy photo on the floor. 
EXLEY Look.  Dudley and Meeks go way back.  Stensland, too. 
Bud sees, but does he really?  As Bud reaches for the photo, Exley relaxes slightly.  Bud slaps the gun away, drops Exley to the ground.  He grabs, begins slamming his head into the floor. 
EXLEY Think, goddamn you.  Think... 
Exley's almost out.  But maybe Bud heard him.  The attack slows, stops as Bud does think.  Exley stays conscious. 
BUD I knew Stensland and Meeks knew each other.  Meeks was with Sue Lefferts on Christmas Eve.  The night I met Lynn.  Lefferts' mother I.D.ed Stensland as Lefferts' boyfriend, but Stens pretended he didn't know either one of them. 
EXLEY Stensland and Meeks.  What were they up to? 
BUD Johnny Stompanato told me when Meeks disappeared, he was trying to move the 18 pounds of heroin that went missing when Deuce Perkins was shot. 
EXLEY Stensland and Buzz Meeks.  Two-man triggers knocking off Mickey Cohen lieutenants.  When they killed Deuce Perkins, they got heroin as a bonus. 
BUD Then something goes wrong.  Meeks gets killed.  Maybe Stens got greedy, killed Meeks and left him under his girlfriend's house. (a beat) The night he died, Stens was all mysterious.  Said he had something big going down. 
EXLEY The Nite Owl!  Stensland was going there to sell the heroin. 
BUD Somebody got wind of it, killed them all. 
EXLEY It wasn't the Negroes.  The Griffith Park report was a phony. And, who says the purple Merc was spotted outside the Nite Owl? 
BUD Dudley. 
EXLEY The first guys to the car when Jack and I got there were Bruening and Carlisle. 
BUD Dudley's guys. 
EXLEY They didn't find the shotguns. They planted them. 
BUD It all keeps coming back to Dudley. 
EXLEY It's Dudley for the Nite Owl. 
They just stare at each other a beat as it sinks in. 
EXLEY Pierce Patchett figures in, too. That's the angle Jack was working. Dudley must work for Patchett. 
BUD Let's just kill them. 
EXLEY What? 
BUD For Jack, for Stensland, for anybody else who got in the way. I've been trying to be smart.  A detective.  But killing those two fuckers, that would be justice. 
EXLEY Stay smart, Bud.  We build a case. We play by the rules. 
BUD There are no rules!  Why the fuck are you doing this?  The Nite Owl made you.  You want to tear all that down. 
A beat as Loew considers his options. 
LOEW It's okay.  These are police. (as she leaves) What do you want? 
EXLEY I want D.A. bureau men to tail Dudley Smith twenty-four hours a day; I want you to get a judge to authorize a wire tap on his home phone; I want authorization to check his bank records and I want it all in an hour. 
LOEW On what evidence? 
EXLEY None.  Call it a hunch. 
LOEW (incredulous) Absolutely not.  Dudley Smith is a highly decorated member of this city's police department and I won't smear his name without -- 
EXLEY Without what, his smearing yours first?  What's he got on you, Loew?  Pictures of you and an out of work actor with your pants down? 
LOEW Do you have any proof? 
EXLEY The proof had his throat slit. (a beat) So far you're not denying it. 
LOEW I'm not going to dignify youwith answers.  If you'll excuse me, I've got a Jack Vincennes press conference to prepare for. 
Loew enters his bathroom.  Bud looks to Exley who nods: Go. 
OFFICE BATHROOM 
Loew is at the mirror clipping a few stray nose hairs. Bud enters full of menace followed by Exley. 
LOEW Unless you're here to wipe my ass, I think we're through. 
Bud just glares at him.  Loew shakes his head. 
LOEW Don't try this good cop/bad cop with me.  I practically invented it.  And so what if some homo actor is dead.  Boys, girls, ten of them step off the bus to L.A. every day. 
The MIRROR SPIDERWEBS as Bud slams Loew's face into it. Bud swings him around, forces him forward and shoves his head in the toilet. 
He holds it there, finally lets Loew up for breath.  Then backhands:  one, two, three. 
BUD Dudley Smith.  Spill. 
LOEW Call him off, Exley! 
EXLEY I don't know how. 
More backhands.  Holding Loew by the scruff of the neck, Bud marches him past Exley and back into the... 
INNER OFFICE 
Bud heaves up the window, practically throws Loew through it.  Loew catches hold of the window framing.  Bud hammers his hands loose with a fist and pushes him through. 
OUTSIDE 
Bud holds his leg.  Loew screams as coins, comb and wallet spill from his pockets, plummet toward the street below. 
INNER OFFICE 
Bud shakes Loew, could drop him at any time. 
EXLEY Bud... 
BUD If I let you go, there'll be ten more lawyers to take your place tomorrow.  They just won't come on the bus, that's all. 
OUTSIDE 
We hear Loew's PANT LEG TEARING loose. 
LOEW Okay!  You're right!  Dudley's got photos of me and Reynolds. 
EXLEY What's Dudley's scheme? 
More TEARING.  Loew's life may depend on the answer. 
LOEW Dudley's rotten to the core.  He's taking over Mickey Cohen's rackets, his own hand-picked cops'll be the new franchise holders.  Because of those pictures I won't be able to prosecute.  Oh Jesus pull me up! 
INNER OFFICE 
Exley helps pull Loew back inside.  Bud dumps him on the floor.  Bruised and bloodied, Loew looks up at Exley. 
LOEW Dudley's got everyone under his thumb.  Not just me, but the Chief of Police, the lieutenant governor, everybody! 
Exley pulls his .38, shoves it into the side of Loew's neck. 
EXLEY Not everybody.  You tip-off Dudley and Officer White visits you alone next time. 
Loew looks at Bud, nods, his face a bloody mess. 
EXT. CITY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
Exley and Bud exit.  Bud's wheels are turning. 
BUD They never made a match on the shotgun serial numbers.  What if Breuning and Carlisle took them from the evidence room?  Couple of cold pieces that had been hanging around a year or two. 
EXLEY We should check the records, and, we should talk to Lynn. 
Bud just stares at him a beat. 
EXLEY You want to talk to her? 
Bud looks away, shakes his head "no."  Finally... 
Bud smiles, in on the plan as theres an answering WHOOP. A third man looks through the window.  BOOM!  Bud nails him. 
Bud motions Exley to stay put, then slips out the window. 
EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT 
Bud crouches, looks between the cinder blocks supporting the room.  Two sets of feet shuffling along.  Bud FIRES the SHOTGUN.  Shrieks as the men go down.  Bud extends the .38 to fire point blank headshots.  Then... 
Bud flattens himself as a wicked CROSSFIRE TEARS UP ROOM 
INT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT 
Exley is forced down as well, lying flat as plaster rains down. 
The door frame splinters as more Dudley men charge in. Four men with rifles.  One is Patchett's Burly Bodyguard. They spot Exley lying there.  Hushed whispers as they approach:  "Dead meat."  "Be careful."  Kicks in the side.  The men look at each other, sneer. 
Exley jerks a foot.  The foot man stumbles as Exley spins around SHOOTING.  FIRING the .45 and his own .38.  All four men go down.  Exley stands, digs into his pocket to reload. 
Bud scrambles back through the window.  Exley looks over and smiles as Bud reloads the shotgun.  It's dead quiet. 
EXLEY I'm thinking we might walk away from this. 
At that instant, Dudley steps through the bathroom door. He's got Exley dead to rights.  As he squeezes the trigger, Bud leaps forward, pushes Exley hard to the ground. 
The SHOT passes through Bud's back by his left shoulder blade.  It spins him around.  A SECOND SHOT to the stomach slows him to a walk as he charges Dudley.  A THIRD ROUND SHATTERS Bud's jaw, but still he comes. Driven by rage, his hands reaching for Dudley's throat. He even gets hold before a FOURTH SLUG tears his chest. 
Bud falls hard. 
Dudley swings his aim to Exley who's just managed to shake the cobwebs of being flattened by Bud.  A frozen moment. 
DUDLEY I'm loathe to kill my brother officers, Edmund. 
EXLEY Tell that to Jack Vincennes.  To Stensland. 
DUDLEY Jack was a shame, but Dick Stensland had the audacity to try to sell me my own heroin.  Through his whore girl friend.  I sent him to make the buy.  The rest is history. 
EXLEY Why? 
DUDLEY A vacuum, Edmund.  That's what we have in Los Angeles.  Sending Mickey Cohen up created it.  My containment work maintained it. Certain photographs guarantee it. Organized crime has been held back, but there's still a demand for the services it provides. 
EXLEY And now you'll provide them. 
DUDLEY Absolutely.  Prostitution and gambling are victimless crimes. The heroin we'll run down to the coloreds.  Anesthetize them.  As long as it's not a middle class problem, no one will care.  It's still a crime free city... for respectable people. 
Dudley aims the .38, cocks back the hammer.  We hear DISTANT POLICE SIRENS. 
DUDLEY This isn't politics, Edmund. There won't be winners and losers when it's over... 
Dudley doesn't see Bud stir, reach into a pocket. 
DUDLEY Just the living and the dead. It's always been that way in the Bureau.  You should've realized that before you became a detective. 
It's over.  Dudley's finger tightens on the trigger.  But Dudley screams as Bud buries a switchblade into his left calf.  It took all Bud had left.  As he collapses... 
Dudley wails; Exley dives for Bud's shotgun.  Dudley FIRES, misses.  A wild SHOTGUN BLAST takes out half the wall.  Dudley stumbles out the door.  SIRENS BLARE. 
EXT. VICTORY MOTEL - NIGHT 
Dudley drops his gun as the cruisers stream down.  Exley steps out behind him, but doesn't drop the shotgun.  The two of them are bleached white by headlights. 
Dudley raises his badge over his head. 
DUDLEY We're policemen! (winks) Let me do the talking.  They'll make you Chief of Detectives. 
Exley steps ahead to block his way. 
EXLEY No. 
DUDLEY Why not, lad?  Absolute justice? 
EXLEY Something like that. 
DUDLEY Really?  Would you be willing to rig crime scene evidence to support a prosecuting attorney's working hypothesis? 
Exley doesn't answer.  Dudley smiles. 
DUDLEY Would you be willing to beat confessions out of suspects you knew to be guilty? 
Exley glares.  Laughing, Dudley brushes by, limps toward the gathering policemen. 
DUDLEY Are you willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance they'll -- 
The SHOTGUN BELCHES flame.  Dudley goes down, shot in the back.  Exley drops the gun, raises his hands over his head.

Riding in a convertible, waving to the crowds is the Grand Marshal -- the new Vice President, a young Richard Nixon.

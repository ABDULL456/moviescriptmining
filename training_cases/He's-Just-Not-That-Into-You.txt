CONOR Hey, it's me...I just wanted you to know that I was thinking about you. 
INT. EDDIE'S OF ROLAND PARK GROCERY - SAME 
ANNA, hot in an earthy sort of way, heads down the aisle. She holds her cell phone in one hand - a BOTTLED WATER and a BAG OF SOY NUTS in the other. 
ANNA Conor, that's so nice.     Thank you. 
As Anna gets to the checkout, there's one person ahead of her. He looks back to see her - he's BEN, good looking and supremely likeable. They share a smile. 
BEN Do you want to go ahead? 
ANNA Hmm? 
BEN Go ahead?   You've only got two things. 
ANNA (into phone) Hold on. 
She looks at what he's got - a SIX PACK OF SIERRA NEVADA. 
ANNA (CONT'D) You've only got one thing. 
BEN Well, technically it's six. And I'm still mulling over a gum purchase. So... 
He steps aside to let her go.   She smiles. 
ANNA (into phone) Hey, let me call you right back. 
She hangs up the phone and moves past Ben, hands her things to the EMOTIONLESS CASHIER. As he rings them up - she looks back at Ben - they SHARE ANOTHER LOOK. 
She hands the cashier her ATM card - he swipes it. 
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER Oh my word. 
ANNA Come on. Seriously. I just deposited money today. There's no way - 
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER It's not that. Let me check something. 
He turns and rifles through a stack of papers, finally finding what he was looking for. 
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER 
(CONT'D) Congratulations. You won. 
ANNA What? 
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER Our "Sizzlin' Summer" promotion.     You're our 1000th customer in June. 
The cashier reaches under the register and pulls out an IGLOO COOLER and hands it to Anna. She BEAMS. 
ANNA Are you kidding? 
EMOTIONLESS CASHIER Do I have that kind of manner? A joking manner? 
Anna looks to Ben.   She looks like she's about to burst. 
ANNA I swear to god, this is the most exciting thing that's ever happened to me. 
Ben can't tell if she's kidding. 
BEN Really? 
ANNA Is that sad? 
BEN No, it's - charming.     Congratulations. 
Anna smiles wide, admiring her cooler.    Then - 
ANNA Wait, no. I can't accept this. You were here first. I didn't win at all. 
BEN Yes, you did. Trust me - it's fate.      You were meant to have that cooler. 
Anna throws her arms around him and hugs him. 
ANNA Thank you SO MUCH. 
Ben can't help but laugh. 
INT. NATIONAL BREWERY LOFTS - NIGHT 
Conor enters his apartment.     ALEX sits on the couch watching TV. 
ALEX Hey.    How was the date? 
CONOR Fine.   You know. 
Conor heads for the kitchen, and turns back. 
CONOR (CONT'D) Why are you here? 
ALEX My cable's out. 
Conor returns from the kitchen with a beer. 
Gigi nods - it's all under control. 
GIGI (reading off her paper) Hey, Conor. It's Gigi. I just thought, I hadn't heard from you and, I mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to wait for a guy's call anyway, right? 
Gigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she seems confused. She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing - "What does this say?". Janine looks - she's no help. 
GIGI (CONT'D) (clearly ad-libbing) I mean, we're all equal, right? More than equal -- more women are accepted into law school now than men, and we do better in those police simulations where you can mistakenly shoot innocent people - (rifles through the pages) - I mean I don't know if you saw that Dateline - but women practically have penises now, right? (looks to Janine, helpless) Well, call me. This is Gigi. Call me. 
Gigi hangs up, unsure.   She looks to Janine. 
JANINE Don't worry.    He's totally gonna call. 
INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Gigi stares at the PHONE. Then she feigns disinterest in the phone. It still doesn't ring. Finally, she picks up the receiver to listen for a dial tone. And PANICS. 
GIGI WHAT?   How can there be no dial tone? 
She frantically jiggles the cord, then hears something. 
GIGI (CONT'D) Mom? Is that you? I can't talk now. I'll call you back. 
She hangs up, stares at the phone again. A look of DETERMINATION crosses her face. She dials. 
GIGI (CONT'D) Janine. It's me. Conor never called, so I'm on the precipice of staging a casual run-in at Red Maple. Pick up if you want to stop me. (beat, then really fast) 
ALRIGHT-I'M-INTERPRETING-YOUR-SILENCE-AS tacit-compliance-bye. 
Gigi hurriedly hangs up, and heads out the door. 
INT. RED MAPLE - NIGHT 
A CROWDED, SCENEY restaurant/bar - with a giant red Japanese maple growing behind the bar (thus the name). 
We follow a THIN, BLACK CLAD HOSTESS as we wind through the throng of stylish twentysomethings at the bar to: 
INT. RED MAPLE - KITCHEN - SAME 
A busy kitchen.   Off the kitchen a door leads to: 
INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - SAME 
ALEX sits at a small, cluttered desk, rifling through some papers. Then, from the doorway: 
KELLI ANN Knock knock. 
Alex looks up to see KELLI ANN - Red Maple's hot hostess, standing in the doorway. She makes her way in. 
ALEX Hey. 
KELLI ANN So.    Here we are. Same shift again. 
ALEX I know.    I make the schedule. 
KELLI ANN 
(FLIRTING) I figured it was no coincidence. 
She leans against the desk.     Alex keeps working. 
KELLI ANN (CONT'D) I had fun the other night. 
ALEX Yeah. It's amazing where 10 shots of Patron will get you. 
Kelli Ann laughs, then thinks - wait, was that nice? 
KELLI ANN Anyway - I was thinking, maybe tonight after work...we could, you know... 
Alex stops what he's doing, looks up at her. 
ALEX Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between us the other night was - fun. But we're way understaffed tonight - I even have to man the bar - and that's why I scheduled you. To work. So... 
He goes back to work. Kelli Ann stands there, frozen. Alex can feel her eyes on him. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Are we good here? 
Kelli Ann's face goes flush. She tries to hide it.    She backs up, puts on a smile. 
KELLI ANN No.    We're good. 
She leaves.   Alex exhales, goes back to work. 
INT. RED MAPLE - LATER 
In the back doorway leading to the alley, Alex stands chatting with TYRONE, 18, a busboy, who smokes a cigarette he holds just outside the doorway. 
Kelli Ann approaches, trying to squeeze through, and 
ACCIDENTALLY (ON PURPOSE) SHOULDER BLOCKS ALEX. HARD. He has to take a step to catch his balance. 
He turns around to see what happened, but Kelli Ann keeps walking eyes front. He and Tyrone share a look. 
TYRONE Dude. 
INT. RED MAPLE - NIGHT 
It's late. The bar is nearly empty. Alex is totaling receipts - and Gigi is still nursing a drink. 
ALEX Look, you seem like a cool girl, so I'm just gonna be honest - Conor is never going to call you. 
GIGI Oh really? How do you know? 
ALEX Because I'm a guy.   It's how we do it. 
GIGI 
(HOPEFUL) He said it was nice meeting me. 
ALEX I don't care if he said you were his favorite female since his mommy and Joanie Cunningham. Over a week went by - and he didn't call. 
GIGI But maybe he called me and I didn't get the message. Or maybe he lost my number, or was out of town, or was hit by a cab, or his grandma died. 
ALEX Or maybe he just didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again. 
GIGI Yeah but my friend Terri once went out with this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off - then like a year later she ran into him -- 
ALEX Your friend Terri's an idiot.   And she's the exception. 
GIGI OK.   But what if I'm the exception? 
ALEX You're not. You're the rule. And the rule is - if a guy doesn't call you, he doesn't want to call you. 
GIGI Really?     Always? 
ALEX Yeah. Always. I know what blowing off a woman looks like. I do it early and I do it often. Trust me - if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit - - he doesn't. No exceptions. 
Gigi thinks this over. 
GIGI Why are you telling me all of this? Aren't these man-secrets - like why men need to watch televised golf? 
Alex LAUGHS. 
ALEX I don't know. You looked like you could really use the help. 
GIGI Thank you. You've given me a lot to think about. 
Gigi smiles at him. 
INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORP. HQ - DAY 
Gigi comes in - carrying a MESSY HANDFUL OF PAPERS, with crazy hair and wearing the last outfit we saw her in. 
JANINE Everything OK? 
GIGI I was up all night. 
JANINE Please say you were working on the newsletter. 
GIGI Sure. It's basically done.   But this is important. 
JANINE What's happening with your hair? 
Beth comes out of her office and looks at Gigi. 
BETH Please come in my office before the others see that you have mini muffin stuck in your hair. 
INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORP. HQ - BETH'S OFFICE - DAY 
Gigi paces in front of Beth's desk. 
GIGI I think I figured it out. Remember when I went out with that notary public? And he cheated on me? And then Anastasia from upstairs told us that story about how her boyfriend cheated on her at the beginning - but then he totally changed and they're married and crazy in love. 
BETH I thought that guy was a process server. 
GIGI No, notary. Anyway, the point is - Anastasia is the exception. Not the rule. We have to stop listening to these stories - because the rule is that most guys who cheat on you up front don't really care about you very much. 
BETH Okay... 
Gigi consults her crumpled pieces of paper. 
GIGI Exhibit A: Chad, the drummer who lived in his storage space. He only used me for rides, yet I continued to stalk him for most of 1998. Then there was Don, who broke up with me every Friday so he could have his weekends free. I was so delusional about our relationship that I referred to him as my husband to random people like my dental hygenist. 
(MORE) 
GIGI (CONT'D) And all my friends would tell me stories about how things might work out with these dipshits because they knew someone who knew someone who dated a dipshit just like mine, and that girl ended up getting married and living happily ever after. But that's the exception. And we're not the exception - we're the rule. 
Gigi sits down, spent.   But Beth has been listening. 
BETH OK. So let me see if I understand. What you're saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a guy for thirteen years, and then he finally married her -- that's the exception. And the rule is that guys - like Neil - who are with girls - like me - for seven years without getting married - are never getting married. 
Beth is serious.   Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack. 
GIGI No. No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. This has absolutely nothing to do with you. I was just talking, you know, about me. Specifically. 
Off Beth, knowing it's about her, too. 
INT. SASSY NAILS - EVENING 
BETH Why are you hanging that? 
NEIL I told you I'd do it weeks ago.   You don't like it there? 
BETH I love it there. But just - stop. 
NEIL It's the image, isn't it? I didn't see it before, but - you're right - it totally looks like a sagging boob. 
Beth is silent. 
NEIL (CONT'D) You want me to take it down? 
BETH No.     I want you stop doing anything nice. 
NEIL Is this a trick? 
BETH No. I need you to stop being nice to me - unless you're gonna marry me after. 
Neil laughs. 
BETH (CONT'D) Is that funny? 
NEIL No.     It was just - I was just-- 
BETH See, you can't keep being nice to me and I can't keep pretending like this is something that it's not. We've been together over seven years. You know me. You either want to marry me or you don't. 
NEIL Or there is the possibility that I just don't really believe in the concept of - 
BETH BULLSHIT! BULLSHIT! Bullshit for every woman who's been told by some guy that he doesn't believe in marriage just to see him turn around eight months later and marry some twenty four year old girl he met at the gym. Bullshit. 
Beth tries to hold back her tears. Neil looks stunned. He hops down off the couch and goes to her. 
NEIL Honey, where is all this coming from? 
BETH From the place that I have been hiding from you for the last five years because I didn't want to seem demanding, or clingy or psycho or whatever. So I never ask. But now I'm going to --- 
Neil looks at her.    She looks at him. 
BETH (CONT'D) Are you ever going to marry me? 
Beth looks at Neil.    There is a long, painful SILENCE. 
BETH (CONT'D) I can't do this anymore. 
She walks out of the room. 
FADE TO CHAPTER CARD:    ... IF HE'S NOT MARRYING YOU 
AMY sits with a sleeping baby in her arms. 
AMY I was with Damon for six years. He asked me to marry him on the phone, because he's just so different and cool like that. Said he'd eventually get me a ring, which he didn't, but he did buy himself a ring because isn't that so hilarious and cool that the guy is wearing the ring? Then, my favorite part is, I stayed with him even after he took back his proposal, and introduced the idea of a "relation vacation." Isn't that a cute name? Let me explain the concept: it involves dating a girl from the time she's thirty two to the time she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her of the ability to bear children, and then, after all that, wanting to take a year off. And giving it a fun name that you can put on t-shirts. (looks at the baby, smiles) I left him. 
INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY 
Ben, our married guy from the grocery store, sits on the floor in a barely furnished room, and dials his cell. 
BEN Hey, Anna. This is Ben. Look, I know it's been a little while since you called. I just - it took me by surprise. But I offered to help you with your career, and I don't see why I can't do that, right? So, give me a call. Maybe you can come by the office this week or something. Okay, take care. Bye. 
Ben hangs up. And STARES INTO SPACE until THE DOOR OPENS TO REVEAL: JANINE. Gigi's co-worker. And Ben's WIFE. 
JANINE Hey, how -- 
Ben is CLEARLY STARTLED. 
BEN Shit - you scared me. 
Janine looks at him. 
JANINE Is everything OK? 
BEN Yeah.   Everything's fine.   Why? 
She sits down next to him, looks at him intently. 
JANINE Are you smoking again? 
BEN No, sweetie.    Why? 
JANINE Well - you get jumpy when you smoke. 
Ben puts his arm around Janine, and pulls her close. 
BEN I'm not smoking. So, why don't we worry about what color we're gonna paint this room, instead of worrying about things that aren't happening? 
Janine contentedly curls up to Ben. 
JANINE I don't know - I was thinking maybe - pink? 
BEN Pink?   Seriously? 
JANINE Well, I mean, at some point. 
Janine gives Ben a knowing look.   He gets it. 
She gets to her desk and is descended upon by - BRUCE, NATHAN, and JOSHUA. All mid-20's. All gay. 
BRUCE So? 
Mary looks at them, smiling, enjoying their impatience. 
MARY He asked me out. 
NATHAN Oh my god!    He called? 
MARY Well - 
JOSHUA He emailed? 
MARY Umm - 
BRUCE What? Did he travel by carriage and leave his calling card with your lady in waiting? 
MARY He MySpaced me. 
The guys all look skeptical. 
NATHAN Ouch. 
JOSHUA I don't know. My slutty sister says MySpace is the new booty call. 
MARY Well, what am I supposed to do? Things have changed. People don't just meet organically anymore. If I want to make myself more attractive to the opposite sex, I don't go get a new haircut - I update my profile. That's just how it is. 
The guys look at her, starting to understand.   Mary's 
PHONE RINGS. 
MARY (CONT'D) Back to work. 
She smiles at the guys - they disperse as she picks up. 
MARY (CONT'D) Ad sales - this is Mary. 
INTERCUT WITH EXT. LIGHT ST. - DAY 
Conor sits on a bench, NEWSPAPER folded open on his lap. 
CONOR Hey, it's Conor. Anna's - uh - friend. Or whatever. 
MARY Hey.   So, did you see it? 
CONOR I'm not sure about this. 
MARY You gotta trust me. It's a burgeoning market. You're gonna make a fortune. 
Conor looks at the paper. 
CONOR Yeah. I hope so. But, like - did you have to put me on the page with the massage ads? 
MARY It was either that or on the page with the personals. I made a call. 
CONOR OK. You're right.      Hey, have you talked to Anna lately? 
Conor leaves the paper and gets up. He walks away, still on the phone, we STAY WITH THE NEWSPAPER AND WE PUSH IN. 
UNDER VARIOUS 1 INCH ADS FOR MASSEUSES, S&M and LEATHER 
TYPE SERVICES - THERE'S A HALF PAGE AD UNDER THE TITLE: 
THE HOME FOR YOUR LIFESTYLE - CONOR BARRY - REAL ESTATE Under which is a picture of Conor, standing in front of a brick Tudor, a SOLD SIGN proudly displayed. In the background - TWO MEN look lovingly at their new home. 
INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DINING ROOM - DAY 
PAIGE, blonde and angelic, looks on as LAURA, CATHERINE, and Beth pull on matching coral dresses. 
CATHERINE I do not understand how you got mom to sew all of these in two weeks. 
PAIGE She wanted to do it. 
LAURA Mom told me she felt like an old Indonesian lady in a sweatshop. 
PAIGE No, she didn't. 
BETH Why again do you need to get married so fast? 
CATHERINE You're so pregnant. 
PAIGE I'm not pregnant. 
CATHERINE Chug a beer, then. I want to see you chug a beer. 
PAIGE We're in love, you assholes. That's what people do when they're in love - they get married. 
Everyone FREEZES.    And looks at BETH.   Big silence. 
PAIGE (CONT'D) Bethie, you know I didn't mean -- 
BETH It's OK.    Neil and I are actually - done - anyway. 
There are cans of paint, bags of cement, some tarps. Janine grabs a TARP, when she sees, on a window ledge, next to a folding chair - AN ALUMINUM FOIL ASHTRAY. 
CIGARETTE BUTTS. AN EMPTY PACK OF AMERICAN SPIRITS. 
She stares at them for a moment, then heads back inside. 
INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - DAY 
CLOSE ON: A TORN BUSINESS CARD, TAPED BACK TOGETHER. The name on the card is JARRAD MONTROSE. Gigi sits, staring at the card. She reaches for the phone, and then thinks the better of it. And again. 
Finally, she grabs the receiver, picks it up, and dials. 
GIGI Hi, this is Gigi. 
INTERCUT WITH:   INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - DAY 
Alex sits in his office.    He talks into his CELL. 
ALEX Gigi? 
GIGI Gigi Phillips. I had the - umm - dentist pen. 
ALEX Right. 
GIGI I'm really sorry to bug you. I just - I thought you had some really good insights the other night and -- I had a question. 
ALEX Okay, maybe I need to be harsh -- Conor is never going to be interested in you. 
GIGI No, I know. This is about - (she looks at the card) - Jarrad. You have a sec? 
ALEX Okay... 
GIGI So I meet him at happy hour and he was completely charming -- 
ALEX Lemme guess - he said the only thing happy about this hour is you. 
GIGI He may have used some derivative of that. So, he says he's going to call, but then gave me his card and -- 
ALEX He's not interested. 
GIGI You don't even know if he called -- 
ALEX Did he? 
GIGI No. But the thing is, I honestly think he's expecting my call. 
(MORE) 
GIGI (CONT'D) He said "Look forward to hearing from you" and not "Look forward to talking to you." I mean, do you hear the connotations? 
ALEX He.   Is.   Not. Interested. 
Tyrone appears in Alex's doorway. 
TYRONE Alex - this is jacked. The hostess is giving me shit for not wearing a white shirt -- this shirt is WHITE! 
Tyrone points to a VERY SMALL WHITE INSIGNIA on an otherwise BLACK SHIRT. Alex shuts the door on him. 
TYRONE    (O.S.) (CONT'D) This shit is white. 
ALEX If a guy gives you his phone number, instead of taking yours, he's not interested. 
GIGI He took mine first, but then he -- 
ALEX And, if a guy wants to see you, he will see you. I once called 55 Lauren Bell's until I got the right one. 
GIGI That's cute.    What happened? 
ALEX As it turned out, her ass looked really huge in daylight. 
GIGI Is it your sensitivity that makes you so popular with women? 
ALEX Don't call him. He doesn't like you. 
GIGI Again with the sensitivity. 
ALEX Just trying to help. 
GIGI I know.   Thanks. 
Gigi hangs up, re-tears up Jarrad's card. 
EXT. DUNDALK HOME - BACKYARD - DAY 
CLOSE ON:   HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM written across a CAKE. 
As the candles are blown out, we widen to reveal: Anna and Conor siting at a cheap picnic table in a tiny backyard, across from MAYA - Anna's mom. 
As Maya refills her glass from a BOTTLE OF WINE, Anna grabs a GIFT from her bag - hands it to her mom. 
MAYA Oh sweetie - you didn't have to get me anything. 
ANNA Mom - you always say that and I always get you something. 
TRENT, early 30s, talks to the camera as he drives his Ford Explorer. He's cute - but trying a smidge too hard - - goatee, leather cord necklace he bought in Cancun, etc. 
TRENT If a girl is into you, she's sleeping with you. And if after a month - two months at the very outside - she's not sleeping with you, she does not like you. I guess the trick is, how to spot this girl early - so you don't waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out that it's never gonna happen. So, I've got some signs about how to spot this girl - gleaned from my own experience, of course. A girl will never sleep with you if: she calls you cuddly or dependable, she pops a zit in front of you, her name is Amber or Christine, she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers in dates 1-3. I know it's not scientific - but I'm just saying - you were warned. 
INT. NATIONAL BREWERY LOFTS - NIGHT 
Alex knocks and opens the door in one motion. 
ALEX Hey dude - you here? 
CONOR (O.S.) Yep. 
Alex heads to the fridge, opens it and looks in. 
ALEX Wanna beer? 
He pulls TWO BEERS out, shuts the fridge and turns to find Conor standing there. He's wearing a REALLY TIGHT, SHINY SHIRT and EVEN TIGHTER, VERY BLUE JEANS. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Or an apple martini? 
CONOR Funny. 
Conor grabs the beer and opens it. 
ALEX Need I ask? 
CONOR It's for work. I'm trying to expand my client base. 
ALEX By pretending you're gay? 
CONOR No.   By being more gay friendly. 
ALEX Or, in real estate terms, by becoming "gay adjacent". 
CONOR Nice.    I may have to use that. 
Conor heads back toward his room. 
CONOR (CONT'D) I'm gonna try something else. This may be too much. 
ALEX I don't know. You dress like that - and you're already seeing a girl who won't sleep with you - I think maybe you can pull it off. 
CONOR (O.S.) It's not that she won't sleep with me douchebag...I have slept with her. It's just, you know, she...um... 
ALEX Won't sleep with you anymore. 
Conor reappears, now wearing A FRENCH CONNECTION TYPE 
TIGHT T-SHIRT AND BLACK JEANS. 
CONOR Pretty much, yeah. (re: his new outfit) So, what do you think? 
Alex gives him the once over. 
ALEX I think you're gonna have to beat 'em away with a stick - you hot, sexy man. 
Conor rolls his eyes and heads back into his room.    Alex laughs to himself and takes another sip of beer. 
INT. FELL'S POINT CONDO - NIGHT 
Leather couch, framed Orioles jersey - typical bachelor pad. Gigi is making out with GREGORY, 30s. 
GIGI Who would have thought that a random girl from Pilates would fix me up with such a good kisser? 
GREGORY Back at you sister. 
Gigi beams.   They make out some more. 
GIGI I can't wait to kiss you again. 
GREGORY Umm.   We're kissing right now. 
GIGI I know. But next time. The second date kiss is way more intimate. 
As they start kissing again - 
GREGORY Well, I'm going out of town tomorrow - so I'll be out of touch for a bit. 
Gregory starts pulling off Gigi's top.    Gigi pulls away deftly. 
GIGI Would you excuse me a quick second?    Too many diet cokes... 
Gigi makes a beeline down the hall. 
INT. FELLS POINT CONDO - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Gigi dials her CELL as she goes through Gregory's bathroom cabinets. 
INTERCUT WITH:   INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Alex is also mid-makeout on his leather couch with a HOT WOMAN. The PHONE RINGS. Alex grabs it. 
ALEX Yup. 
ANNA So, friends, right? 
BEN Totally. 
And with that, Anna pulls off her top. And then her sweats. And, totally naked, slides into the pool. 
ANNA You wanna come in? 
BEN I'm sorry.   I don't trust myself. 
ANNA OK.   You can just watch. 
He does. 
BEN You may be the best friend I've ever had. 
Anna LAUGHS, and then dunks her head under the water. 
INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Ben comes in the front door, drops his gym bag. Janine sits on the couch flipping through a magazine. He leans in to kiss her on the cheek. She does not look happy. 
JANINE Honey - you smell different. 
Ben pulls back smoothly. 
BEN Different how? 
JANINE I don't know. 
BEN Well that's an odd thing to say. 
She looks at him.    He tries to coolly meet her gaze. 
JANINE Maybe it's the ashtray and cigarettes I found. In the side yard. What part of "my dad died of lung cancer" is hard for you to wrap your brain around? 
BEN What? 
JANINE Do not lie to me, Ben.      Please. 
BEN Are you serious? We have like eight thousand undocumented workers in this house daily. You find cigarettes, and you automatically assume they're mine? 
JANINE Well, yes. 
BEN Honey, I'm not lying. And you are really freaking out. I think the renovation is getting to you because nothing is going on. Just please - relax. 
Ben walks away.    Off Janine, wanting to believe him. 
EXT. BALTIMORE YACHT CLUB - DOCK - DAY 
Ben walks to a boat at the end of the dock. He stands, unsure, before deciding to KNOCK on the side of the boat. NEIL emerges - unshaven, possibly unshowered. 
NEIL Ah.     My first visitor. 
BEN This boat is sick. How come you never invited me out before? 
NEIL Well, this was supposed to be just for Beth and I - for our retirement. Leave our jobs. Sell the house. Take off. 
Neil is clearly having a tough time. Ben doesn't know what to say. They're silent for a second. 
NEIL (CONT'D) Sorry. Where are my manners? Permission to board granted. I'll show you around. 
Ben smiles, steps on to the boat. 
EXT. INNER HARBOR - DAY 
CLOSE ON: A cigarette being lit. WIDEN to reveal Neil smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out into the bay.   Ben stands across from him, looking on. 
NEIL (re: cigarette) Sorry. 
BEN It's OK. 
Neil switches to his left hand, away from Ben. 
NEIL So Janine sent you to check on me? 
BEN Yeah.    Pretty much. 
NEIL Any message from Beth? 
Ben shakes his head no.    Neil seems disappointed. 
BEN I think she's been busy getting ready for her sister's funeral though, so... 
NEIL Her sister's what? 
BEN Wedding.    Her sister's wedding.   What did I say? 
Neil is now LAUGHING HARD. 
NEIL You said funeral. 
BEN No, I didn't. Shit, did I? 
GIGI Awesome. I'm stuck here with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday - and meanwhile this girl - (motions to GIRL at the bar) - she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak. 
The GIRL is standing between TWO GUYS. 
ALEX Nope. 
GIGI How do you know? 
ALEX See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise thing. She's interested. He's not. 
GIGI You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not interested. 
ALEX Actually, I can. I manage a restaurant. I see this stuff go down every night. Watch -- 
As if on cue, Tom Cruise Guy BANGS his elbow into the GIRL, hard, causing her to spill her drink. Tom Cruise Guy sees, but doesn't acknowledge. Alex looks smug. 
GIGI Man, you have a gift. 
ALEX And check out droopy dawg on her other side. He can buy her drinks all night, and she'll insist there's no "spark." 
GIGI Maybe there isn't.   You need a spark. 
ALEX The "spark" thing is bullshit. 
GIGI Really?    Enlighten me. 
ALEX Guys invented the "spark" so they could not call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing, and then convince you that the anxiety and fear that it creates in you is actually a "spark." And you all buy it. You love it. You all thrive on it because you all love drama. 
GIGI I don't. 
ALEX Really? So you don't wait until the last minute on deadlines, or on phone bills, because you love the drama of not knowing whether you'll make it? 
She's busted. 
GIGI Maybe. 
ALEX And let me guess - when you were stalking Conor that night - were you obsessing about him calling for days, even though the date was just kind of mediocre? 
GIGI OK.   Yeah. 
ALEX See, you thrive on drama. You gotta be more like me - if a girl likes me great, if not, there are plenty more like her - probably with smaller pores and bigger implants. 
GIGI That's beautiful. 
ALEX Thanks. 
They continue drinking and observing the scene. 
GIGI Why are you sharing all this inside dating information with me again? 
ALEX I dunno.    I like you. 
GIGI You do? 
ALEX Don't start doodling my name on your binder. I just mean, I like you, like I like basset hounds. They're kinda pathetic - so you want to cheer them up. 
GIGI Again with the sensitivity. 
Alex smiles at her.   Gigi can't help but smile back. 
INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - MORNING 
Janine walks down the hallway, with JAVIER (40, stocky), her contractor. She's inspecting the crown molding. 
JANINE It looks good. 
JAVIER Yes. 
JANINE He does good work. 
JAVIER He's very good. 
Janine stops and looks at Javier.   He looks back at her. 
JANINE Javier. 
JAVIER Yes. 
JANINE Javier, if I asked you an honest question, do you think you could give me an honest answer? 
JAVIER I think so. 
JANINE Good. Because I think some of your guys have been - smoking. 
Janine looks at Javier.    It's awkwardly silent. 
JANINE (CONT'D) Javier? 
JAVIER Is that the question? 
JANINE Yes. 
JAVIER Oh.    It seemed like a statement. 
INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
Gigi blows in, dumps her things and turns to Janine: 
GIGI He's into me. 
JANINE Awesome. I knew it. (she hugs Gigi) Who's this now? 
GIGI Alex. It's totally clear to me now. He's Watts. 
JANINE What? 
GIGI From Some Kind of Wonderful. 
JANINE Wait, isn't Mary Stuart Masterson Watts? 
GIGI Yes. 
JANINE So, why aren't you Watts? 
GIGI I'm Eric Stoltz. 
JANINE What? 
GIGI Alex is Watts because Watts helps Eric Stoltz go on a date with Amanda Jones, but really she's in love with Eric Stoltz herself. 
JANINE Wait - so who's Amanda Jones? 
GIGI I guess Conor at first. Now men in general. But that's not the point.    The point is -- he's into me. 
JANINE You know, I knew there had to be a reason he was spending all that time with you. 
GIGI I know! It's so obvious now -- there are so many signs. 
JANINE Oooh, gimme the signs.   I love to hear about the signs. 
Janine rolls her chair closer to Gigi's desk. 
GIGI At first they were small - like when I first called he said "Good to hear from you" - 
JANINE Totally good sign. 
GIGI Right? And then the next time I called he was with a woman - but he still took the call. And talked to me for a while. 
JANINE You know it was a woman? 
GIGI He called her "babe." 
JANINE A guy does not leave a woman - to talk to another woman - unless there's something going on. 
GIGI I know! And it gets more obvious. I mean, please - there was no guy he was going to fix me up with. The fix up was him. 
JANINE Wait - really? 
GIGI He shows up - without this fictitious Bill character - and the two of us basically have a date. And then he calls me to invite me to a party at his place. 
JANINE You're right. He so likes you. 
Janine rolls her chair up to Gigi's computer screen. 
JANINE (CONT'D) Let's look up places for your destination wedding. Would you guys wanna do Napa Valley - I've always wanted to go there. 
Gigi laughs but doesn't fight as Janine starts searching. 
INT. BALTIMORE BLADE OFFICES - DAY 
Mary sits at her desk, surrounded by her gays.    They are all looking at her computer screen. 
CLOSE ON:   A MYSPACE PAGE. NAME:"YOUR SOUL-UTION" 
SEX: MALE   AGE: 29 FROM: FUNKYTOWN FRIENDS : 1282 
MARY There's no way he's already called - we only met for coffee last night. I mean we video iChatted. While holding coffee. Kinda like having coffee. 
Nathan hands her the phone. 
NATHAN Just call your voice mail. 
MARY And he told me he had a gig last night, so he probably got in real late. Did I tell you he was singer? 
BRUCE Just call. 
Mary cradles the receiver with her shoulder and dials. 
JOSHUA On speaker. 
Mary hits the SPEAKERPHONE button. 
YOUR SOUL-UTION (O.S.) (SINGING, in a sexy voice) Maaaary. Mary, Mary, Mary, Maaaary.   Oh my Maaary. 
Mary is clearly charmed.    The gays all SWOON. 
NATHAN I just got hard. 
Janine just STARES AT HIM, FUMING. 
BEN (CONT'D) Look, I talked to Neil, and he said I could stay on his boat for a while if -- 
Now Janine's eyes go wide with disbelief. 
JANINE EXCUSE ME? And now you want to move out? You're like - what - leaving me? 
Ben looks confused, but is trying to roll with it. 
BEN No. NO. I just assumed that you wouldn't want me to -- 
JANINE We're not going to deal with this? We're not going to figure out a way to work through this? 
BEN I just assumed that once I told you, you would want me -- out. 
JANINE Is that what you want? 
BEN (almost a whisper) No. 
JANINE 
OK. 
She heads down the aisle with the cart. Ben follows, confused - that didn't go how he thought it would. 
EXT. GRAMERCY MANSION - DAY 
The lush grounds surrounding a beautiful turn-of-the- century mansion. The procession of a wedding has just begun. TWO ADORABLE FLOWER GIRLS start things off. 
Then Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with her husband, STEVEN. Beth's sister Catherine and her husband GEORGE are next. Big smiles all around. 
Then Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort - BUDDY, a 12 year old CHOCOLATE LAB, wearing a coral bow tie. Beth forces a smile as she processes with Buddy - who stops to piss on a chair leg. Beth is not happy. 
INT. GRAMERCY MANSION - DAY 
A lavish reception. Beth takes her seat next to DAN, 40s. Dan looks over at Beth's place card. 
DAN You must be Beth. 
BETH Yep. 
DAN I've heard a lot about you from Paige. I'd been lobbying for weeks to be seated next to her single sister. 
BETH Oh, yeah? So you are - (looks at his placecard) Dan. 
DAN Uh, sort of. 
BETH Hmmm? 
DAN Well, I'm actually a wiccan.    So I have a magickal name. 
BETH Really? 
DAN It's Brother Phoenix East-Horse. But I didn't know if that would fit on a card. 
Beth slaps on a fake smile, and grabs for the wine. 
INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
A PARTY is in full swing. Typical affair for someone in their late 20's - mediocre food but decent alcohol. 
Gigi stands, somewhat uncomfortably, near the Chex Mix. She tries smiling at a TALL GIRL, who ignores her. So Gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls of Chex Mix into her mouth. 
NATHAN It makes your breath stink. 
GIGI Pardon? 
Gigi looks up to see Nathan and Bruce - Mary's gay coworkers who are now decked out in full-on Saturday night gay mode - standing next to her. 
NATHAN Chex Mix. I learned the hard way. I made out with a guy after eating like a bag of the stuff. He said my breath smelled like trout. 
Gigi puts her handful of Chex Mix back. 
GIGI Thanks for the tip. 
NATHAN I'm sorry. That was rude. And that guy I made out with was a total asshole. 
BRUCE You want me to smell you?   I'm sure you don't smell like trout. 
Gigi LAUGHS. 
GIGI Thanks.   I'm good. 
She cups her hand and surreptitiously checks her breath. 
NATHAN I'm Nathan.   This is Bruce. 
GIGI Gigi.   How do you guys know Alex? 
BRUCE We don't. Our friend Mary heard about it from some guy named Conor. 
Gigi smiles in recognition. 
She CATCHES ALEX'S EYE across the room, he's talking to friends. She smiles and gives a THUMBS UP. He gives an awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation. 
INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER 
Gigi is in the kitchen, mixing up some DIP. She chats with a couple of PARTY-GOERS, very much at home. 
PARTY-GOER #1 Really great party. 
GIGI Thanks. When Alex said he wanted to have a party, I was like "Let's do it." 
PARTY-GOER #2 Thanks so much for having us. 
GIGI No problem.   Anytime. 
An attractive TALL GIRL enters the kitchen, and starts LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS. Gigi watches with interest. 
GIGI (CONT'D) Can I help you find something? 
The Tall Girl finds a BOWL in the cabinet, and grabs it. 
TALL GIRL No, that's OK. I got it. 
She brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts emptying Gigi's dip into the bowl. Gigi is THROWN. 
TALL GIRL (CONT'D) Thanks for mixing that up. 
GIGI What? 
TALL GIRL Alex asked me to get the dip together. Thanks for getting it started. 
Gigi's face grows red.   The Tall Girl tastes the dip. 
TALL GIRL (CONT'D) Hmmm - could use a little more dill. 
Then the Tall Girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and heads back out to the party. Gigi looks to the confused party-goers, not pleased. 
INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Bruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave. People are getting coats - the crowd is definitely thinning. 
Gigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline. 
GIGI When someone's underwear ends up in your toaster oven - it's been a good party. 
Alex looks at the toaster oven and laughs. 
ALEX I guess people had fun. 
Then, the TALL GIRL emerges. 
TALL GIRL Alex, you want me to start cleaning up? 
Gigi STARES DAGGERS AT HER. 
GIGI That's sweet of you. But I thought I'd stick around, so I'll take care of it. 
TALL GIRL No.   I got it. 
The tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a trash bag. Gigi grabs one, too. Alex looks mystified. 
ALEX Knock yourselves out. 
INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - STILL LATER 
It is really late. Everyone's gone - except the TALL GIRL and ALEX, who sit on the couch playing a NBA LIVE on the XBOX. Gigi enters from the kitchen. 
GIGI I think I've rounded up the last of the beer bottles. 
The tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game. Gigi stands there awkwardly. 
GIGI (CONT'D) So, umm - what game is this? 
They ignore her.   She looks around.    It's awkward. 
GIGI (CONT'D) Well, maybe I should just -- you know -- I mean it's past three and -- 
TALL GIRL YES!!    Suck it! 
Alex tosses down his controller. 
ALEX You are sensational. 
The tall girl beams.   Gigi flinches. 
TALL GIRL Did you say it's past three?     Man, I gotta go. 
Gigi suppresses a SMILE. The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug, and heads out. Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next to him on the couch. They're silent for a moment. 
ALEX Thanks for staying and helping clean up - but I really gotta get to bed. 
GIGI Is that an invitation? 
ALEX What? 
Beth hauls the dishes downstairs and through the den where Steven, Laura's husband, is on the couch, intently watching the golf channel. 
STEVEN Hey, Beth. Grab me a beer if you're going that way? 
Beth rolls her eyes. 
STEVEN (CONT'D) And a little plate of cold cuts if there are any left? 
Beth just keeps on walking. 
INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME 
Beth walks by Paige, on the couch, and DEVON, Paige's new husband, on the floor, surrounded by a mess of VINYL RECORDS. He has an old BOBBY DARIN tune BLARING. 
BETH You might wanna kill the volume just a smidge. My mom is finally taking a nap. 
DEVON You think your dad really wants to hang on to all this vinyl? My collection could use a bunch of these. 
BETH Turn it the fuck down. 
Both Devon and Paige look at her, stunned. 
INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - KITCHEN - SAME 
The kitchen is a total MESS. Beth sets the dishes down in a precarious pile of other dishes, and sees her sisters Laura and Catherine at the kitchen table. 
BETH I finally got mom to lay down in the spare room. All we have left to eat is some old jelly and ramen noodles, so after I tackle some of these dishes, maybe we can go to the store. Our new brother is trying to co-opt dad's property before he's even dead. 
(MORE) 
BETH (CONT'D) And Laura, your husband would really like a beer to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf channel. 
Beth looks up. Laura is pointing to Catherine, who has her head in her hands. She's CRYING SOFTLY. 
BETH (CONT'D) It's OK.     It's all gonna be OK. 
CATHERINE What am I gonna do without dad? 
BETH First of all, he's upstairs watching 'Oprah After The Show'. 
LAURA And second of all - you have us. 
CATHERINE But he's always been - the one who's there for me. 
BETH What about your husband?    Where the hell is he? 
CATHERINE Playing ultimate frisbee.    His team may make the quarterfinals. 
Beth rolls her eyes.    The DISHES crash in the sink. 
INT. MCCORMICK SPICES CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
Janine sits at Beth's desk, across from Gigi, who stares at her in disbelief. Janine fiddles with a TILE SAMPLE. 
GIGI Do you know who it is? 
JANINE (shaking her head "no") It doesn't matter. 
GIGI So are you going to - leave - him? 
JANINE Gigi, he's my husband. He's not just some guy that didn't call me back. And he did admit it to me. He didn't wait to get caught. That takes courage. 
Gigi is clearly STUNG. 
JANINE (CONT'D) I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.     I know Alex was not just some guy. 
GIGI It's OK. 
JANINE It's my fault, you know. 
GIGI What? 
JANINE I'm willing to accept my responsibility in this. I forced him into getting married. He wasn't ready. 
GIGI Janine - this is not your fault. 
JANINE It is.  I've - changed. I used to be fun. I was fun when we met. 
GIGI You're still fun. 
A BEAT.   Janine looks at Gigi, the tears come. 
JANINE We never have sex anymore. 
GIGI Lots of couples got through lulls. 
JANINE No. We never have sex. Realistically, what did I expect him to do? 
GIGI I don't think that's really -- 
She looks down at the TILE in her hand. 
JANINE This is too small. I gotta tell Javier. 
JANINE I don't know. I just thought - maybe we could, you know, relight the fire. 
BEN Honey, did you hear what I just said? I gotta get this offering statement out. 
Ben picks up some papers, but Janine is not giving up. 
JANINE Look, I am trying here. Do you want to save our marriage or don't you? 
Janine looks at Ben.   Ben is SILENT. 
INT. BEN'S OFFICE - CLOSET - SAME 
Anna sits, holding back tears, as she listens closely. 
BEN (O.S.) Of course I do. 
JANINE (O.S.) Then you'll let me do this. 
Then a ZIPPER OPENING, a chair CREAKING - 
JANINE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Yeah, just like that, yeah... 
We HOLD ON Anna as she sits there, stonefaced. 
INT. RED MAPLE - BAR - EARLY EVENING 
Alex has the staff (of about 10) assembled for the pre- shift meeting. He consults a clipboard as he talks. 
ALEX OK - Tyrone you bus 4 through 6 - and pitch in with the servers when you - 
TYRONE No...I'm on 8 thru 10. I'm always on 8 through 10. Been working here 18 months doing 8 through 10. 
ALEX Right.   Luis you take 4 through 6. 
The staff looks at each other - perplexed. 
TYRONE Dude.    Luis quit like 10 months ago. 
Alex rifles through his papers, not sure what he's looking for. He slams his clipboard on the bar. 
ALEX Do we even need to have this meeting? Seriously? Does this serve any purpose? 
The group voice their opinions - a resounding "NO". 
ALEX (CONT'D) Good.   Great. Get to work. 
The group disperses, Alex heads around the bar.   He sees Kelli Ann walking away and calls after her. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Hey, Kelli Ann - any calls for me? 
KELLI ANN Since you asked me 11 minutes ago?   No, not a lot of phone traffic. 
Kelli Ann starts to turn away as she sees Alex grab his cell phone, look at it, then put it down. He grabs a beer, takes a swig - then grabs his cell phone again - staring at it, willing it to ring. He puts it down again. A HUGE SMILE grows on Kelli Ann's face. 
KELLI ANN (CONT'D) Oh my god. 
ALEX What? 
KELLI ANN It's happened to you. 
ALEX What has happened to me? 
KELLI ANN What's her name? 
ALEX Who? 
KELLI ANN The girl, Alex. 
ALEX There's no girl. 
Alex takes his beer and heads down the bar. 
KELLI ANN You can't hide it man. I know strung out and you are strung - out. 
ALEX Please - 
KELLI ANN This is amazing. Can't focus, right? Jumping every time your phone rings, checking your email 100 times a day. Wishing you could write songs. Feeling the need to bring up her name in random conversations... 
Alex stops at the office door. 
KELLI ANN (CONT'D) It's always the same. And it has happened to you, my friend. Trust me. 
Alex looks at Kelli Ann, her words settling in. 
ALEX Shit. 
Kelli Ann smiles, and as she walks away - 
KELLI ANN Welcome to my world asshole. 
Alex takes this in, KNOWING SHE'S RIGHT. 
INT. BEN'S OFFICE - EVENING 
MAYA (CONT'D) Well, your father and I had a glorious life together. 
ANNA Are you kidding? All you talk about are the things you didn't do, the people you wish you could have been with, the Tim Buckleys - anything but the life you actually had. 
Maya looks at her daughter. 
MAYA Those are just dreams Anna. 
Anna tries to process this. 
MAYA (CONT'D) Now true - I did not like your father at all when we met. 
(MORE) 
MAYA (CONT'D) Or after we got married for that matter. But let me tell you this - life with him was a hell of a lot better than life is without him. 
Maya stands, walks slowly toward the kitchen. 
MAYA (CONT'D) There are worse things in life than settling. 
ANNA Like what? 
MAYA Like wishing you had. 
Anna considers this. 
INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Anna lays on her bed, staring at the ceiling. 
The doorbell RINGS, Anna gets up to answer it. Almost as soon as she turns the knob, Conor is standing in the middle of her studio apartment. He is all amped up. 
ANNA Hey, sweetie. 
She reaches up to give him a hug, he doesn't go for it. 
CONOR See, why did you call me sweetie? 
Anna looks confused. 
ANNA Because we always call each other that. 
CONOR Why? 
Anna doesn't have an answer for that. 
CONOR (CONT'D) I want to say something, OK? I mean, we call each other sweetie, and we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours and I washed your hair for you after you had that shoulder surgery and everything - it's like we're together. 
ANNA I know that I - 
CONOR Let me finish. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I haven't been clear about what I want. So let me be clear. I love hanging out, but I am so attracted to you, and I just - I want both. I want to make love to you. I know that sounds kind of embarrassing coming out of my mouth - I just freaked myself out, too - but it's true. And I'm not sure what happened, or why we stopped - but I don't really care. I just -- 
ANNA 
OK. 
Conor is STUNNED. 
CONOR What? 
ANNA 
OK. 
CONOR I'm talking about really doing this. Like a full-on relationship. 
ANNA Right. 
CONOR With me. 
She LAUGHS. 
ANNA Yes. 
CONOR Did a bunch of gay people put you up to this? 
ANNA Please stop talking. 
He does.   They KISS. 
INT. ANNA'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER 
Conor sleeps peacefully with his limbs wrapped around Anna. Anna lays on her back, eyes wide open, STARING AT THE CEILING. She's clearly not at peace. 
INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DEN - DAY 
All of Beth's sister's spouses - Steven, Devon and George - sit on the couch watching basketball. 
DEVON Shit!    Take him out.   He's done. 
GEORGE Jesus.   This isn't some exhibition game. 
Beth comes downstairs, with another set of dirty dishes, and walks past them to the kitchen. The guys are annoyed that she blocks their view. 
Neil ushers her in, shuts the door.    Beth looks around. 
BETH (CONT'D) I wanted to thank you. For coming by my folks' house. 
NEIL Of course. I really care about your dad. And I really love you. Even if I can't give you what you want. 
BETH You're what I want. 
Neil looks at her - unsure of her meaning. 
BETH (CONT'D) Our life together is what I want. Your love is what I want. Did you see those guys my sisters are married to? You are a better husband to me - without being married - than any of those real husbands will ever be. And that's enough for me. 
NEIL And you'd really be OK if we take the marriage thing off the table? 
BETH If you promise to love me and be committed to me - 
NEIL I always have - 
BETH Wait, I'm not done. And snake the shower drain when my hair clogs it, and let me eat Wheat Thins in bed. 
NEIL I do. 
Beth smiles.   They KISS. 
NEIL (CONT'D) So, I get to move back in? 
BETH I guess.   But, you cannot bring those. 
She points to his pants - a RAGGEDY pair of CARGO PANTS. 
NEIL What? You're just mad at me, and you're taking it out on the pants. 
BETH Look, I gotta win something. I let you win the big battle, so throw me a bone. 
NEIL OK. We're not getting married, but I'm chucking the pants. 
BETH Great.   We both win. 
They kiss AGAIN. 
INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Gigi sits on her bed, head flung upside down, blow drying her hair. The phone RINGS but Gigi doesn't hear it. 
INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - SAME 
Alex, in his office, paces as he talks into the phone. 
ALEX Hey, Gigi. It's Alex. I was just wondering how you were doing. It's been a little while since we've talked -- and I was wondering how you were doing. 
Alex looks up. Tyrone is watching him, shaking his head. Alex motions for Tyrone to leave. He doesn't. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Anyway, I was hoping to talk to you. Obviously. But you're out. So, call me. Sometime. Or tonight. I'm around. OK. That's enough now. It's Alex. 
He hangs up.   Tyrone is unimpressed. 
TYRONE Dude. 
ALEX I know.   I know. 
INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - SAME 
Gigi flips her head back - oblivious to the phone call - and checks her hair. She heads out of the bedroom. 
EXT. ROWHOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Conor and Anna climb the stairs of a three story row house. A "FOR SALE" sign is outside. 
ANNA You seriously get a ton of people bidding on this? 
CONOR I know it's crazy. But it's a neighborhood "in transition." 
ANNA So that means what - that hip gay people want to live out here? 
CONOR Yeah. Hip gay people, young couples, young families. 
Conor smiles as Anna heads into the house. 
INT. ROWHOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
ANNA Weird - it totally reminds me of the house I grew up in. I bet there is a - 
Anna goes into a little nook off of the kitchen.   And pulls down a BUILT IN IRONING BOARD. 
ANNA (CONT'D) We totally had this same thing. My mom would use this as her 'desk'. Isn't that bizarre? It was always covered with her little coupons and stuff. 
Anna looks up to Conor, who is just watching her. 
ANNA (CONT'D) So, when do all the fabulous homosexual couples start arriving? 
CONOR Well, the open house is tomorrow. But I have this one buyer. I mean, I want to see if his girlfriend likes it first - 
ANNA His girlfriend? 
GIGI Really?     What did you forget? 
ALEX This. 
Alex reaches into his pocket and pulls out a PEN. THE 
SAME PEN THAT GIGI PRETENDED TO BE RETURNING TO CONOR. Gigi tries, without success, to suppress a SMILE. 
FADE OUT. 
INT. THE OWL BAR - NIGHT 
A speakeasy from the 1900s that hasn't changed much. A PIANO starts to play on a tiny stage - empty. And then - a terrified but determined Anna takes her place in front of the mic. And begins to SING. 
It's a "THE LAST GOODBYE" by JEFF BUCKLEY - barely recognizable - more of a torch song. As she sings, she begins to gain confidence. We hear the song over: 
INT. WESTSIDE LOFT - DAY 
Beth and Neil's place. Neil comes in holding a few MESSILY PACKED BOXES. He is clearly moving back in. 
NEIL How did all this stuff fit in here fine before? 
Beth comes in after him, holding some of his clothes. 
BETH I don't know. It expanded. 
Neil collapses on the couch. Beth sits next to him, a pile of clothes on her lap. She looks down and laughs. 
BETH (CONT'D) No you are not trying to bring these back in here - 
Beth holds the CARGO PANTS that she protested before. 
NEIL What?    I have no idea what you're - 
BETH We had a deal. These are not staying. 
NEIL That's really gonna free up a lot of space. 
BETH They're going. I have a bag I'm taking to the Goodwill. 
Neil watches her, smiling, as she walks across the room. 
NEIL Okay, okay. You win. Just check to make sure there's nothing in the pockets before we give them away. 
Beth dutifully puts her hands in the pockets. And then she FEELS SOMETHING. Her face registers curiosity as she pulls out - A BLACK VELVET RING BOX. Beth looks at it, and when she looks up - Neil's down ON ONE KNEE. 
NEIL (CONT'D) I love you so much. So much. I want to make you happy. I need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being happy, too. 
Tears stream down Beth's face.      Neil pops open the box, revealing an ENGAGEMENT RING. 
NEIL (CONT'D) Will you marry me? 
Neil gets up and KISSES HER. They kiss, passionately, for a long moment. And then: 
BETH Yes.    Of course, yes. 
INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Gigi and Alex stand in her entry.     She holds the PEN. 
GIGI You came all the way here - at 11 at night - to give me back a promotional pen? 
ALEX I thought I better come up with some excuse to get over here. Isn't that how it's done? 
GIGI Sometimes. 
Alex looks at Gigi for a long moment.    He looks nervous. 
ALEX Look, I can't stop thinking about you. I drive by your place. I call and hang up. I'm turning into - 
GIGI Me. 
He LAUGHS. 
ALEX Yeah. 
GIGI Well, a wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl, he will make it happen. No matter what. 
ALEX True. 
GIGI Hmmm. Because when I was hurling my body onto yours - you did not seem to want to "make it happen."

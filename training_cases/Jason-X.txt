JASON X - Revised Rough Draft 
JASON-X BY TOD FARMER REVISED ROUGH DRAFT MAY 24, 1999 
FADE IN: 
DARKNESS. 
A scream rises to an ominous crescendo as we SHOCK CUT INTO - 
MONTAGE of fast moving clips.  Death, destruction, fear.  All images taken from the previous ten Friday The 13ths. 
AGAIN, DARKNESS. 
OPEN ON: 
The year is 2455. The place is Old Earth. Barren, void of life, a hazardous and violent planet. The sky is blood red with spiked clouds of dark gray.  It is beautiful, but frighteningly foreign. 
BLUE LIGHTNING CRACKLES as several figures rush through a DUST STORM below. 
Small groups of people, wearing thick dusters, goggles and masks, work nearby. Some dig in the cracked earth, others take assorted readings with strange devices. 
This is an archeological expedition. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DARK PLACE 
The dust storm rages outside. Two figures are looking closely at a small object buried in the dirt. One of them pulls a device out of their pouch and slowly, gently picks up the object. The other uses a magnetic tool to remove the dirt. 
FEMALE VOICE Careful . . . 
MALE VOICE I know. 
They take off their masks and goggles. They are both young. ADRIENNE female (17) watches as STONEY male (18) studies the object closely. 
STONEY (reading) Not guaranteed, if used After 2198. 
CLOSE UP of the object. It's an unopened condom. 
ADRIENNE (smiles) You thinking what I'm thinking? 
Stoney tosses the high tech equipment over his shoulder and rips open the condom as Adrienne rips her clothes off. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
They are in a half buried mini-van.  It rocks violently from the raging storm outside and from the raging lust inside. 
BACK INSIDE THE VAN. 
ADRIENNE (breathless) What about Kkinsa? 
STONEY is desperately trying to take off her bra. 
STONEY It's over between us. You're the only one for me! 
METAL SCREECHES! THE FLOOR COLLAPSES! 
They fall some ten feet, RUBBLE RAINING down on top of them. 
INT.  DARK CORRIDOR 
A rusty metal ladder. Debris everywhere. Half inch layers of dust cover everything. Dead. Lifeless. 
STONEY You okay? 
Adrienne sits up, shines her light down the long metal corridor. She turns her light on STONEY then sees something over his shoulder. 
SHE SCREAMS A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM. 
We PULL BACK, out of the tunnel, through the van as the sounds of the storm drown out ADRIENNE'S SCREAM. 
CUT TO: EXT.  BASE CAMP 
The digging and readings have stopped. A group approaches a time scarred shuttle and begin loading their packs into the cargo belly. 
FAT LOU (40), rail thin, possible female, pilot, appears at the top of the shuttle ramp. 
FAT LOU (yelling over the wind) Let's go! Time to load up! 
YLLO(33), a professor of archaeology lowers his veil. 
YLLO (yelling) I'm missing two! 
FAT LOU Shit! Temp's dropping! We should have left this rock an hour ago! 
BOEMAN (eyes a device) North three clicks. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MINI-VAN - DAY 
YLLO and the rest of the group run into view. BOEMAN (18), husky, physical; holds out a device and checks the reading. 
He points to the rusted out mini-van sitting on its belly. 
BOEMAN (yelling) There! 
KICKER(30), bulky, short on temper, rushes up wearing futuristic military garb - 
KICKER Yo, Teach, what the fuck? 
YLLO We're missing two of the kids! 
KICKER Get your ass back to the shuttle. I'll check it out. 
KICKER moves past the group and into the Van. 
YLLO Not without me! 
The rest of the gang look at each other and climb into the Van. 
INT. ANCIENT CORRIDOR 
YLLO and the others climb down a rusted ladder. Metallic walls, graffiti, cluttered floors. No Stoney or Adrienne. A sign from the ceiling states - 
DELONGPREE Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year. 
ADRIENNE Check it out. 
With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning - 
A SKULL AND CROSSBONES 
KKINSA So don't open the door. 
ADRIENNE Look beyond it, yesterday's news. 
Yllo pushes his way to the window. 
Shocked faces. 
INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled up into a ball, is a body - female, young. 
YLLO Is that? 
KAY-EM 14 The room's still operational. She's perfectly preserved. 
Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio. 
YLLO (into radio) Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century! 
KICKER Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door. 
YLLO This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way. 
Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited. 
YLLO Okay, no screwing around. This is the real thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, open it up. 
Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget. 
KKINSA You're opening the door? What about the . . . ? 
She points to the skull and crossbones. 
DELONGPREE I'm thinking we should call in some experts. 
YLLO This is your find people. You want to give your credit away? 
DELONGPREE I was just saying . . . 
THORGAN The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back. 
KAY-EM 14 Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious. 
DELONGPREE Knock you on your ass pal. 
They don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice crystals crack and fall to the floor. 
EXT.  CRYO CELL 
YLLO Kay-Em! 
Kay moves into the room ahead of the others. 
INT.  CRYO CELL 
CLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES 
They are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the body. 
--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the wound in her shoulder, props the body up. 
The other enter the icy chamber. 
DELONGPREE I speak on behalf of the group when I say . . . that's fucked. 
KAY-EM 14 Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . . 34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick shit house. 
YLLO Thorgan?!!! 
THORGAN Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back. 
KAY-EM 14 Time of hibernation 2049. Crystallization at seventeen percent. Suggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of rejuvenation eight-one percent. 
KKINSA What's going on? 
DELONGPREE She's dying. 
JANESSA Bitch looks dead to me. 
The RADIO CRACKLES . . . 
SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.) Yllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass back to the shuttle!! 
YLLO Janessa, stretcher. (into radio) Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have a medical emergency here not tot mention the discovery of a lifetime. 
SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.) Kicker! Get them the hell out of there! 
Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground. 
Kicker grabs Yllo. 
KICKER We're outta here! 
Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of blood and -CRACK-breaks it off. 
YLLO Fine, grab that end. 
Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled body on the stretcher. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit - 
THORGAN Hey check this out! 
Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete. 
THORGAN This caused the leak and there's an occupant. 
A laser strikes the body of Jason Voorhees, breaking off a chunk of ice. 
THORGAN (reading from device) They're not after us. Their sensors are locked in on . . . him! 
Thorgan points to JASON'S STRETCHER. 
KICKER Leave him behind! 
YLLO No! He's coming with us! 
They round a corner . . . 
BOEMAN Here. We're one meter from the surface! 
KICKER Then duck. 
CHA-CHUNK . . he cocks his grenade launcher and fires at the ceiling. 
KABLOOM!! Rocks and falling debris reveal the violent surface above. 
DELONGPREE It's too high! 
Kicker rolls around the corner and starts blasting! 
KICKER Make it happen! 
JANESSA They're just subclass B droids. I'm so not impressed. 
BOEMAN Stoney, you catch. 
Stonet leaps, grabs the lip and tosses his feet up and over in a very acrobatic move. 
Boeman kneels, cups his hands to make a step. He begins tossing his friends up to Stoney as Kicker makes war in the hall! 
Soon, Boeman and Kicker are the only two left. 
BOEMAN We're clear! Let's go! 
Boeman leaps up, grabs the lip and pulls himself to safety. He spins around and holds his arm out for Kicker. 
Kicker leaps, grabs Boeman's hand. Boeman strains to pull him up as spider's cover the floor below them, then - 
A spider crawls up Kicker's leg - a spike shoots out into Kicker's thigh. He screams. 
KICKER They've got me! Let go! 
BOEMAN No! 
Boeman ROARS and pulls harder. Kicker's pack RIPS from his body - the spiders falling with the pack. 
EXT. SURFACE - DAY 
The sand storm is raging on the surface. Kicker lands on top of Boeman. 
BOEMAN That wasn't so bad. 
Kicker bites the pin from a grenade, tosses it into the hole. 
KICKER (yells) This will be! 
The others dive for the ground as -  - 
KAFOOM! A FIREBALL rises up out of the hole! 
THORGAN Nice touch. 
BOEMAN And you said high school was boring. 
Our team fights the winds and rushes up the ramp of the waiting shuttle. 
FAT LOU is waiting at the ramp. He looks at the two stretchers. 
FAT LOU Oh my God . . . what the hell is . . . 
YLLO Just get us to the ship! 
Azrael stops in a panic! 
AZRAEL Oh shit I forgot my arm! 
ADRIENNE Here. Dumbass. 
She hands him the severed limb as they race up the ramp. 
The door closed, the SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF THE GROUND and soars into the sky. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  ORBIT AROUND OLD EARTH - LATE 
THE SHUTTLE maneauvers through the junk that now floats in orbit. Old satellites, the front quarter of a Space Shuttle, etc. 
INT.  SHUTTLE COCKPIT 
Navigating through the debris, FAT LOU grabs a radio mike. 
FAT LOU This is Beowulf approaching from sector fifteen. 
Through the front windshield we see - - 
GRENDEL, a class IV Catamaran Transport. It looks like two huge torpedoes attached by three thin walkways. Not new, but by no means old. 
BERNIE(V.O.) I've got you, Beowulf. Proceed with docking. And by the way, Brodski's pissed. 
INT.  DOCKING BAY 
The shuttle doors open revealing SERGEANT BRODSKI and six E-X GRUNTS standing with weapons at the ready. 
As the group gather their equipment and begin to move the two stretchers, Brodski stepsi n front of YLLO. 
BRODSKI What the hell were you thinking? 
YLLO ignores him, turns to his team. 
YLLO Get them in the lab! 
Adrienne and Stoney push Jason into the lab. 
LAB TWO is smaller and less high-tech than LAB one. They shove JASON'S body onto the EXAM TABLE. 
ADRIENNE Fucking Yllo! Thinks he can push me aside. This is my find! 
She removes chucks of ice from JASON'S FACE. 
STONEY You know even though we both found this guy , I'll let you take the credits. You can take it from here. 
ADRIENNE Oh thanks . . . fine go. It's just another dissection. You'll only get in my way. 
STONEY Cool. Besides, you're into this shit. 
Stoney leaves Adrienne alone with Jason . . . and he is THAWING. 
INT.  LAB ONE 
Yllo walks around the room, overseeing all the action. He's excited and cocky. 
YLLO Hands on training is rare. You should consider yourself lucky. 
AZRAEL Lucky?! 
Azrael sits in a large machine. This is . . . 
The NANO-TECH 2000. It can repair non-fatal injuries with the use of Nano-Technology. 
Azrael is scanned by the NT-2000 and so is his injury. It goes into action as articulated mechanics begin to re-attach his arm. 
AZRAEL Another hour and I'd have lost the arm. 
JANESSA Oh, was that the hand you beat off with? 
AZRAEL I better get extra credit for this shit. 
YLLO Delongpree, Status. How you doing? 
Delongpree cuts her underpants from her body and tosses them over his shoulder. 
DELONGPREE (swallows hard) I'm Okay. 
STONEY Well she's definitely a blond. 
JANESSA Oh that's scientific. 
DELONGPREE You think all girls from the past looked this good? 
JANESSA She's not that great. 
THORGAN 400 years . . . I bet she'll be horny. 
YLLO Okay, people, we need to Learn everything there is to learn about our two guests. And if all goes well, I'll mention each one of you when I make my nobel prize speech. 
DELONGPREE (underbreath) Yeah, right. 
Delongpre presses a button on the table. The edges of the table RISE UP to create a clear dome around the table. A hot gel-like substance shoots out of small tubes. The FROZEN BODY is covered in the NANO-GEL. 
Thorgan checks a monitor. 
THORGAN Everything looks good. 
Yllo smiles - gushing self-satisfaction. 
YLLO Turn up the heat. 
Adrienne is wearing a metal eyepiece while staring at a computer screen. No hands. 
ADRIENNE Done. Crystallization remains seventeen percent. 
INT.  LAB TWO 
Adrienne scans Jason with a machine identical to the one Kkinsa was using in LAB ONE. 
COMPUTER VOICE Crystallization at sixty percent Subject classification . . . deformity. 
ADRIENNE Put it on the screen. 
A monitor lights up with a scan of Jason's body. The internal organs are distorted and bloated. She keys into the next lab. 
Back to lab one. 
ADRIENNE(V.O.) (over speaker) Guys, check out beef-cakes scan. 
Jason's 3-D scan appears on one of the big monitors. 
ADRIENNE(V.O.) Look at the brain. 
Within Jason's skull is a brain the size of a golf-ball. 
JANESSA It's just like Thorgan's. What do you think this means? 
Thorgan grabs his crotch. 
THORGAN This is what it means right here. 
JANESSA Small brains make your balls itch? 
DELONGPRE And what's with the headgear? 
KAY-EM 14 The mask is an artifact from a sport outlawed in twenty-twelve. 
BOEMAN Hockey. 
KAY-EM 14 A medieval sport where two teams club one another with elongated sticks. Very sexy. 
YLLO What do you expect from a culture that sucked its planet dry of resources. 
She eyes Stoney. He smiles knowingly. 
KKINSA This bores me. 
DELONGPRE She's red. Body temp 98.6. This is so cool. 
YLLO Prep defib and start the cell reconstruction. 
PEREZ(V.O.) If you're for real, you're looking at a million credits for viewing rights alone. Doesn't include touring and guest lectures. When can you get them here? 
YLLO I'll reset our course . . . 3 hours? 
PEREZ(V.O.) See you then . . . doctor. 
Yllo's face glows with thoughts of fame and fortune. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
INT.  HALL OUTSIDE YLLO'S QUARTERS 
Janessa has hooked up a small device to the door. She's heard every word. 
INT.  STONEY'S CABIN 
Kkinsa rips off Stoney's shirt. Stoney grab her and rolls on top of her. 
INT.  LAB TWO 
CLOSE ON JASON'S HAND - it curls, the frozen joints CRACKLE. 
Adrienne turns from Jason's mask. A large wad of goo hits the floor. She turns back to her work. Slicing flesh away from the mask. 
INT.  STONEY'S CABIN 
Stoney and Kkinsa kiss passionately as they wrestle to get each other's pants off. 
INT.  LAB TWO 
Adrienne tries to pry the Mask off . . . but it holds firm. 
She stick s a long sharp tool into an eye hole. We hear disgusting noises as she probes JASON'S EYE SOCKET. 
She removes the tool, and on the end is Jason's eye! 
Holding it close she looks at it. It is bloated and distorted. She drops it in a specimen jar and takes it over to her work station. 
INT.  STONEY'S CABIN 
Kkinsa rolls on top of Stoney. She holds his arms down as she whispers in his ear. 
KKINSA How bad do you want it? 
Stoney gets his arms free and rolls on top of her. 
INT.  LAB TWO 
JASON'S LEG JERKS! 
Adrienne turns again, then approaches. 
ADRIENNE Interesting. Record. Thawing has caused possible muscle spasms. 
She frowns at the disgusting ooze. A mixture of swamp waters, blood, and other thawing bodily fluids, puddle around Jason's body. 
She moves back to her work station and picks up JASON'S BLOATED EYE. She takes out an autopsy laser and cuts through the center of the eye. 
The laser slices through the fatty tissue as thick black goop drips out of the eye. Adrienne stares into a microscope. This is all very interesting. 
INT.  STONEY'S CABIN 
Stoney lies on top of Kkinsa. 
KKINSA Yes . . . yes . . . that's it! 
. . . a moment, then both GASP as he enters her. 
INT.  LAB TWO 
JASON sits up! 
CLOSE on ADRIENNE as she studies the dripping eye. She puts the laser down and turns to the slab and freezes. 
JASON IS GONE! 
She spins around only to find Jason standing behind her. He grabs her by the throat! She can't scream. She kicks wildly as he studies her. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
INT.  LAB ONE 
Delongpre, Boemen, Kay-Em 14 and Thorgan wait and watch girl in the NANO-GEL. Thorgan is getting impatient. He can't find something. 
THORGAN Anybody seen the reticulator? 
INT.  LAB TWO 
Adrienne is thrown into a work light. The room goes dark. 
INT.  LAB ONE 
DELONGPRE Try next door, there was one there yesterday. 
Thorgan exits. 
INT.  LAB TWO'S OBSERVATION ROOM 
The lights go. Thorgan looks around. Through the thick glass, where JASON is killing Adrienne, is blackness. 
THORGAN Wakey wakey love birds . . . Yllo's gonna be pissed if he catches you fooling around instead of working. 
Thorgan roots through a drawer, his back to the glass. 
ANTE ROOM 
Through the glass beside him we see Adrienne screaming. But NO SOUND. All rooms are air tight. Her head is smashed on the glass! 
Still screaming, her face recedes back into the darkness as Thorgan looks over his shoulder. 
THORGAN Bye, lovebirds . . . Stoney, you dog. 
He exits. 
BACK TO JASON 
INT.  LAB TWO - MOMENTS LATER 
The others enter to find Rizzo leaning over Adrienne's headless body. 
YLLO Jesus! 
JANESSA Oh my God! Adrienne? 
THORGAN What have you done? 
RIZZO What have I done?! Idiots. 
Thorgan throws up. 
BOEMAN (into a mike) Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency! 
DELONGPRE Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player? 
RIZZO I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves. 
JANESSA Maybe she tripped. 
Brodski and Kicker burst into Lab Two, they react to the carnage. 
BRODSKI Jesus, God! 
KICKER Oh man, what the hell happened? 
RIZZO Jason! Can't you see? He did this. 
YLLO Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive. 
RIZZO I didn't say he was alive. 
CUT TO: 
INT.   GRID 52 
Azrael moves through a maze of walls and pipes. Stea, HISSES lights STROBE. 
He's dressed in full military garb, a huge gun strapped to his hsoulder. 
STALKING POV 
Something watching Azrael, his back to us. Azrael moves. The stalker closes in. 
Suddenly Azrael hits, rolls and comes up Blasting right at us. 
HIS POV 
A HUGE ALIEN CREATURE, fangs, claws and so on, leaps at him. THe big blaster hits home. The alien DISINTERGRATES. 
Sitting on the floor, Azrael sighs and wipes his brow. 
SUddenly, another alien rises up behind him with a hideos Screech. There's nothing Azrael can do. He's a goner. Then -- 
FZZT! A blast from elsewhere DISINTERGRATES THE CREATURE. MOVE TO REVEAL-- 
DALLAS, the grunt Azreael had words with earlier. 
DALLAS That's nine to four, geek-boy. 
AZRAEL You got lucky. 
DALLAS You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head. 
AZRAEL Speaking of which, duck! 
Dallas hits the deck as Azrael FIRES, disintegrating another. Beyond it lunge a half dozen more.  Dallas and Azrael scramble to their feet, take aim, when -- 
ONE OF THE ALIENS IS CUT IN HALF! 
GREEN GOO squirts from its body. 
AZRAEL What the?! 
JASON VOORHEES 
SLASHES THROUGH another alien, splitting it down the middle. Then another. 
DALLAS He's good. 
Azrael smiles knowingly. He takes aim and lets loose a blast at Jason. Aliens scatter as the blasts hits Jason dead on. Dallas joins in unloading on the hulinking terror. 
THeir assault has no effect on Jason whatsoever. 
DALLAS That sucks. Why won't he go down? 
AZRAEL Pause play. 
Suddenly the aliens freeze in place. Jason stares at them, then turns to Dallas and Azrael. 
DALLAS He's not part of the program. 
AZRAEL Hey cool. They brought ancient hockey guy back to life. 
Jason walks up to them. Titls his head like a dog hearing a high-pitched whistle. 
Why aren't they running. 
AZRAEL Hey! We're playing a game here. Get off the court! 
Jason raises his silver blade high. 
DALLAS No, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts... 
SLASH! The blade slices through Azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his rib cage. Blood spurts as his right side pulls away from his body. Azrael does not seem hurt, only pissed. 
AZRAEL Asshole that does not count as a kill. 
DALLAS Yes it does. 
AZRAEL Oh, come on! 
JASON is confused. He spins and slashed taking Dallas' head clean off. The head falls to the ground, then Dallas speaks. 
WIDE:  Hard beams of light search for anything. 
Sven, as his beam hits Azrael's pod. 
SVEN Oh shit. 
From inside pod as Sven and Kicker approach. THe blood splattered inside the glass glows in the throws of their lights. 
Kicker breaks off to inspect the other POD Sven tries to hold down his lunch. 
SVEN Sarge, this is bad. The kid's His guts are ripped out. 
BRODSKI (over radio) Dead? 
SVEN Oh yeah. 
Kicker reaches the other POD. the darkness looms behind him as he finds his friend. KICKER (into radio) Sarge, this is Kicker. Dallas got it to. Real slice and dice. What should we do? 
INT.  LAB TWO 
Everyone is in shock except Brodski...he's a pro. 
BRODSKI Report to weapons. We're going on a hunt. 
KICKER IN THE GRID 
KICKER Roger that. (to himself) Time to kick some ass! 
From behind him a shape materializes. A hand reaches out of the darkness. 
KICKER JUMPS! Spins around with his weapon at the ready! 
IT'S SVEN! 
SVEN Sorry! 
KICKER Don't friggen do that! 
INT.  LAB TWO 
Brodski is in assault mode. 
BRODSKI Yllo, what's your head count? 
YLLO Looks like we're missing two. Stone and Kkinsa. 
JANESSA You know, Stoney's done everyone on this trip but me..what's up with that? 
Brodski scans the room - a tactical assessment. 
BRODSKI This place should be safe. Get them back here. I don't want to be hunting around and kill one of your kids by accident. As much as I've dreamed of doing that. 
Brodski goes to Rizzo while Yllo buzzes Stoney's cabin. 
BRODSKI I need to know what you know about this guy. 
RIZZO Don't go out there. You can't win. We need to get off this ship. That's all there is to it. 
BRODSKI Not an option. I'm going to hunt this son of a bitch down. 
Rizzo shakes her head. She can't get through to this guy. 
BRODSKI I've been a grunt for fifteen years. There's not a problem I can't fix with enough ammunition. 
Yllo is getting no response. 
YLLO Stoney! Stoney if you can hear me, get your ass down to the lab immediately! (beat) I'm going to see if I can find them. 
Yllo opens the door and Kkinsa is there! Half-naked, covered in blood. Janessa SCREAMS and the others gasp. 
Kkinsa falls to the floor..whimpering, in shock. Boeman rushes over to her with a blanket. 
KKINSA Sstoney's dead! 
They all look to each other, searching for what to say or do...Rizzo puts her head in her hands...not again. 
INT.  CORRIDOR 
Brodski double-checks his sidearm as Yllo follows him down the hall. 
YLLO ALL I'm saying is dock with Space Lab, couple of hours no more. Let them take a look at our friends. 
BRODSKI Not a chance. 
YLLO JUst don't go in there half cocked. You guys have a tendency to blow shit up and ask questions later. 
BRODSKI You got that right. 
They arrive at the door of the WEAPONS ROOM. 
YLLO This thing could be worth a great deal.... scientifically...not to mention what the fat cats on Earth II would pay for it! Look, I'll split it with you 50/50... 
The door opens. The E-X Grunts are all there. Weapons in a rack on one wall. They are in various states of battle dresss. Yllo follows Brodski in. Brodski turns and faces him, his men behind. 
BRODSKI You sumbitch! Three dead! On my watch! If that...that thing is out there, it's dead! You got it!!! 
KICKER Fuckin A... 
BRODSKI Now get out of our way...get back to the lab and baby sit your snot nosed brats... we've got a job to do! 
INT.  LAB ONE 
Yllo enters pissed off. The others are standing around not sure what to do. 
YLLO That bastard! Boemen turn on the tracking monitors. 
Rizzo walks over to Kay-em 14. Thorgon is working on her. 
RIZZO Robot huh? 
KAY-EM 14 Kay-em 14. 
RIZZO Barbie from hell... 
KAY-EM 14 Cybernetics science droid, fluent in over six... 
BACK TO BRODSKI 
BRODSKI DAMNIT to hell! We're coming to you! 
INT.  LAB ONE 
A BLIP flashes for a second on the screen. 
THORGAN You see that? 
BOEMAN Briggs, Geko, movement beyond the boxed fuselage. 
INT. CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE 
BRIGGS Got it. 
BRIGGS and GEKO split up, moving around a large metallic tank. 
BRIGGS INFARED POV 
Gun ready, he moves around the crated fuselage slowly. 
BRIGGS I don't see anything. 
INT.  LAB ONE 
The blip flashes again. 
INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE 
BOEMAN(V.O.) He's right there! In front of you! 
INFARRED POV reveal GEKO moving toward him. 
BRIGGS That's GEKO. mAYBE you kids should stay out of this. 
Briggs removes his gogles only to find Jason standing before him, holding Geko's body...impaled onto his silver blade. 
BRIGGS fires...screams. 
INT.  LAB ONE 
BRIGGS(V.O.) He doesn't show up on... 
PAINFUL GURGLES then two more blips disappear. 
THORGAN (turns) Jesus, is this what it was like on your... 
Rizzo is cowering on the floor, her hands over her ears. She's sweating, convulsing. 
BOEMAN Sergeant, you've lost two more men! 
INT. CARGO BAy - PORTSIDE 
Brodski and his remaining men double-time-it to the slaughter. Briggs and Geko lie dEAD AT THEIR FEET. 
KICKER Jesus, Sarge, what is this thing? 
BRODSKI Teach! Where the hell are you?! Where's our visuals?!! 
INT. LAB TWO 
Yllo is talking on  aseparate mike. Unwaakre of the slaughteri n the next room. 
YLLO Fat Lou, we're changing courses for the Solaras Space Lab. 
FAT LOU(V.O.) I'll need the sergeant's okay on that. 
YLLO We've got a situation here! Just do as  you're told! 
FAT LOU(V.O.) Alright, relax. 20 minutes. Soon as we've passed Tara's rings we'll make the course correction. 
BACK TO YLLO. 
YLLO Thank you. 
Yllo disconnects, and turns to the other console. 
YLLO (into mic) Ok Sarge, what's your status? 
BRODSKI(V.O.) wHAT'S My status?! I've lost three men and your worthless fuck! After I kill this asshole I'm coming your Yllo! 
YLLO But I didn't see... 
INT.  CARGO BAY - PORT SIDE 
GUNFIRE ERUPTS! 
SVEN(V.O.) I got him! I got him! 
INT. LAB ONE 
CHEERS from everyone except Rizzo who knows better. She shakes her head. 
THORGAN Yes! 
RIZZO Listen up duck fuckers, you can't kill this thing. 
BOEMAN Duck fuckers? 
RIZZO He's either unconcious or playing dead, whichever, he ain't really dead. Okay, you know , that's it for me. I'm outta here. 
DELONGPRE Outta here? 
RIZZO Isn't there an escape POD on this ship? Something? 
THORGON There's a shuttle. 
RIZZO Alright, been nice knowing you. Who's with me? 
KKINSA I'll go. 
BOEMEN Yllo said stay here. 
KKINSA Fuck Yllo! 
RIZZO tNighty-night. 
Janessa collapses.  Yllo rushes Rizzo again, but this time Boeman stands, blocks his path. 
CRUTCH Leave her be. 
RIZZO Ok, who do I gotta fuck to get off this boat? 
Thorgan timidly raises his hand. 
RIZZO Listen to me. Please. Let's get off thsi ship. Come with me. 
THORGAN Rizzo, a shuttle out in the middle of space? We'll die oout there. 
Rizzo rushes the door. There's a code box on the wall. 
RIZZO How do you open the damn door? 
YLLO You're crazy! 
Kkinsa punches in the code. The door HISSES open. 
DELONGPRE Rizzo, he's out there. 
RIZZO Yeah and he'll be here soon enough. (looks at Delongpre) Last chance. 
The others stare at her. She's crazy. 
RIZZO Fine. Bye. 
She and Kkinsa exit, the door SWISHES CLOSED behind them. 
YLLO (favoring his nose) Pack your shit. We'll disembark in an hour. The guys at Space Lab have the necessary equipment to contain this thing and then we can study it. 
But the kids aren't so sure. 
INT.  LAB TWO 
Yllo enters, makes sure he wasn't followed then approaches a console. 
YLLO Computer on line. 
A series of beeps. 
JANESSA(O.S.) What are you doing? 
YLLO (jumps) Jesus! Can't you knock? (back to console) Diminish power to shutttle Beowulf. 
COMPUTER VOICE Power to Beowulf disengaged. 
YLLO (to Janessa) She's too valuable. She's not leaving this ship. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GRENDEL BRIDGE 
Fat Lou and Bernie prepare for course corrections. 
FAT LOU Disengage auto-pilot. 
BERNIE Disengaged. 
FAT LOU New COURSE, seven-eighty-one. 
EXT.  GRENDEL CLASS IV 
She banks slowly to the right. 
INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE 
BERNIE On course. ETA 36 minutes, 34 seconds. 
FAT LOU Engage auto pilot. 
Suddenly, Bernie is ripped from his chair! Electricity SHOOTS through the console as Bernie's DIALOG becomes jibberish. 
BERNIE En-en-en-en...Eta-Eta... 
Fat Lou stares up in shock just before JASON SLAMS Bernie's torso ontop of her. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
FAT LOU'S upper body has disappeared. In other words, Bernie now has legs. Little good they'll do him. 
THROUGH WINDSHIELD. 
Far in the distance we see a tiny space station -- SPACE LAB. A monitor reads ... 
SPACE LAB ETA 00:35:59 and counting. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CARGO BAY 
Rizzon and Kkinsa enter. 
RIZZO Which way? 
Kkinsa points. They head in that direction. Then Rizzo suddenly stops. 
KKINSA What? 
RIZZO Ssh. 
Rizzo pulls Kkinsa close to one of the crates. 
RIZZO He's in here. 
Kkinsa opens her mouth to scream. Rizzo slaps her hand over Kkinsa's mouth. 
RIZZO You scream I'll snap your neck. Got it? 
Kkinsa nods. Rizzo releases her. 
KKINSA (whispers) How do you know? 
THORGAN Jesus, tell this asshole I don't play hockey! 
CRUTCH Okay! 
Our group starts climbing the table and into the ceiling space. 
YLLO Will that take us to the bridge? 
CRUTCH It's a maze up there, but yes. 
YLLO We'll engage auto-pilot! Everything'll be fine! 
With that, the door gives! 
Boeman heaves Crutch into the crawl space then follows himself.  Jason pauses, staring at Kay-Em -- 
KAY-EM 14 Heart beat irregular...no blood flow... impossible...this....this... does not make sense. 
Jason's heard enough. He swings his cleaver, but Kay-Em ducks. Turns and leaps through the hole in the celing. 
INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE 
Yllo grips the ledge. 
YLLO Move it people! 
Then Yllo screams. Jason has him from below. Boeman grabs his arms. 
BOEMAN Help me! 
DeLongpre grabs hold and pulls. Suddenly Yllo is jerked out of their grasp. They fall onto their backs breathing heavily. 
INT.  LAB ONE 
Yllo leaps to his feet. Jason looms over him. 
YLLO Now hold on! Have you considered how valuable you are? Credit, fame, you can have it all. And ladies. I mean, how long has it been? 
Jason stands there, but his attention isn't on Yllo. It's on the machete sticking through Yllo's belt. Jason reaches for it. Yllo backs into a wall. 
Jason slowly removes the machete from Yllo's belt and stares at it. He drops the cleaver to the ground. 
YLLO (chuckles) That's all you wanted? 
INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY 
The shuttle doors slide open as we hear over the headset -- 
YLLO(V.O.) It's okay, he just wanted his machete. 
RIZZO (knowingly) Three...two...one... 
Yllo screams. 
INT.  CEILING WALK SPACE 
Yllo's SCREAMS turn to GURGLES. All eyes stare at the opening in the walkway, then -- 
YLLO'S HEAD LANDS IN BOEMAN'S LAP! 
KAY-EM 14 Now that's just gross. 
JASON STICKS HIS HEAD THROUGH.  EVERYONE JUMPS, SCREAMS. 
DELONGPRE GO, GO, GO! 
They race down the walkway, over huge pipes and through electrical wires, Crutch in the lead. 
INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY 
Kkinsa enters the shuttle, turns to Rizzo. 
KKINSA Rizzo, come on! 
But, Rizzo hesitates. We can still hear the PANICKED SCREAMS over the headset. 
THORGAN(V.O.) Go-go-go-go-go!!!! 
DELONGPRE(V.O.) He's right behind us! 
RIZZO Damn! (to Kkinsa) Close the door! I'll be right back. 
KKINSA (panicked) What?!! 
RIZZO I gotta go back. 
KKINSA But?!! 
Rizzo turns and races through the maze of boxes and crates leaving Kkinsa nearly insane. 
INT.  CELING WALK SPACE 
KAY-EM 14 I'm quite sure I wasn't designed for this. 
Crutch comes to a fork in the walkway. 
CRUTCH Okay, we need to ... 
BOEMAN You forgot didn't you, you old fart? 
At the back of the line, Delongpre turns as Jason rounds the bend behind him. 
DELONGPRE Shit! Move it! He's coming! 
Delongpre leaps forward creating a pile out of Janessa and Thorgan 
DELONGPRE Go! 
Racing forward the group stays just out of Jason's grasp. Leaping over and under and through whatever blocks the path. 
DELONGPRE Faster! 
Jason swings his machete at DeLongpre! It just misses him. 
DELONGPRE FASTER!!! 
But Jason has other plans. Seemingly unfazed by the past events he rushes after them. 
INT.  GRENDEL BRIDGE 
COMPUTER VOICE Dam-damage port side 59 percent. Decompression 40 percent. Gravity-y rotors failing. 
INT.  CARGO BAY 
Our kids race toward the door, Jason right behind them -- 
Thorgan slams the door panel with his good arm. SPARKS fly. The door won't open. 
THORGAN Oh shit. 
They turn as Jason looms toward them, then -- 
EVERYTHING STARTS TO FLOAT 
Cargo and debris. Our heroes. Jason. 
The loss of gravity and Jason's steamrollering momentum SLAMS him into the cargo doors, BREAKING them open and sending him tumbling backwards. 
JANESSA This is just great. 
KAY-EM 14 Engage magnetics. 
Kay-Em 14's left hand magnetically locks to the Cargo frame a 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Jason grabs Rizzo's ankle. Boeman, floating close, punches Jason in the back of the head. 
Still holding Rizzo's ankle, Jason topples, spinning the two out of frame. 
The force of the punch sends Boeman in the opposite direction. 
THORGAN This is crazy, we can't do anything like this! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Rizzo KICKS Jason in the top of the head, sending him SLAMMING into the ceiling. 
A SEVERED ARM 
floats past DeLongpre. There's a chain gun still clutched by the  hand. Delongpre grabs both and turns the gun on Jason. 
BRAAATTTT... 
Jason is sent further back, but the force of the chaingun SLAMS Delongpre into a back wall. He's knocked unconcious. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
As Thorgan manages to grab Kay-Em 14 around the neck. 
THORGAN Grab my hand! 
Janessa takes his hand and in turn reaches out and snags the unconcious dELONGPRE'S FOOT. 
JANESSA Boeman, can you reach DeLongpre? We'll push you in. 
CARGO - MIDSHIP 
Jason is floating toward the other end of the Cargo Bay, unable to stop himself. 
BOEMAN 
reaches for DeLongpre. Inches away. Finally he grabs Delongpre by the locks of his hair, pulls himself closer. 
DELONGPRE Hey! That hurts. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Rizzo is floatin g up near the ceiling. She manages to grab hold of a hanging piece of busted catwalk. 
DELONGPRE (to Rizzo) Push off toward us. 
JANESSA Forget her, she's a pain in the ass. Let her hang there. 
Crutch's body floats into our heroes, his intestines spilling from his open gut, tangling around our heroes. 
THORGAN I'm gonna spew. 
JANESSA That ought'a help the situation. 
DELONGPRE Do it Rizzo! We'll catch you. 
RIZZO'S POV 
Rizzo stares at the human rope that consists of Thorgan, Janessa, Boeman, and Delongpre. 
RIZZO What if you miss? 
DELONGPRE What if we don't? 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
AS JASON steadies himself against a wall, focuses in one Rizzo, then pushes off with his feet. 
HE ROCKETS toward her! 
DELONGPRE He's coming right at you! 
Rizzo spots Jason and pushes off! But her aim was HURRIED... and bad. She's gonna miss them. 
Boeman flips in the air! 
BOEMAN (to Delongpre) Grab my feet! 
Delongpre does and Boeman reaches out and snags Rizzo. The momentum spins the human chain into a near wall --KAFWAM-- nearly breaking it apart. 
JANESSA Okay that hurt. 
BOEMAN Thorgan, pull us in. 
Jason SLAMS into the ceiling, then careens off of the wall -- 
Janessa stares at him. 
JANESSA What's the point? 
Delongpre shrugs. 
DELONGPRE So that's it then. 
It seems it is. 
Janessa stands over Yllo's decapitated body. It's obvious their relationship went beyond just teacher/student. There is a loud METALLIC WHINE from the ship's hull. 
RIZZO What's that? 
BOEMAN THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship. 
KAY-EM 14 No... (signing) That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang. 
RIZZO Are there any other shuttles? 
JANESSA No. 
RIZZO Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge? 
THORGAN You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you? 
JANESSA A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it? 
KAY-EM 14 I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn. 
THORGAN Am I in there? 
KAY-EM 14 Sory... 
RIZZO Hey. 
DELONGPRE That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good. 
RIZZO Hey!! 
All heads turn to Rizzo. She's staring at a schematic of the ship. The left hull of the two hulled ship is lit up with blinking light denoting the various system failures. Rizzo points to the right hull. 
RIZZO What's this? 
DELONGPRE It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom. 
Rizzo points at the thin walk-ways connecting the two hulls. 
RIZZO Can we get through these? 
THORGAN Sure but what good will that do? 
BOEMAN When the left hull goes, so will the right. 
RIZZO What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship? 
They stare at her. 
JANESSA You know, Yllo seemed to think we could catch this guy alive, well, he'd be worth millions. 
The others stare at her as if she were crazy. 
RIZZO Any connection between your reality and mine is purely coincidental. 
JANESSA I'm just saying. 
RIZZO (to others) Come on. You got all these gadgets and shit. Why can't we get inside the right hull, seal up the doors and blow the walkways? 
DELONGPRE We'd need charges. 
BOEMAN We could convert fission transistors. 
THORGAN We're not supposed to do that. 
BOEMAN What are you gonna do, tell me? 
DELONGPRE The engine room will have molecular welders. We could seal up the hull. 
A moment of consideration. Could this actually work? 
JANESSA YeaH, GREAT IDEA! And I'll keep the big guy distracted with a blow job. 
THORGAN Would you? 
KAY-EM 14 Now this is getting exciting. 
DELONGPRE Remember to roll his balls around a bit. 
RIZZO You got a better plan? 
Obviously they don't. They got to work. Boeman grabs a number of devices from under a cabinet. 
BOEMAN I'll need system four converters. 
THORGAN They're back here. 
DELONGPRE How many? 
BOEMAN Bring 'em all. Let's move! 
Thorgan's still hooked up to the Nano-Tech machine. 
THORGAN Hey! I'm not ready. 
BOEMAN Then you better hurry. I'll blow alley one, Delongpre, you and Rizzo take there. Janessa you ready two and we'll meet up there. 
JANESSA You're so bossy. 
THORGAN You're leaving me here alone? 
Delongpre tosses the chaingun next to him. 
DELONGPRE Don't blow your foot off. 
They climb through the hole in the corridor and disappear. 
RIZZO(O.S.) Jason seemed to have the right stuff. Physically, anyway. Radiation, cell damage, didn't matter. He just kept going. 
INT.  WALKWAY THREE 
DELONGPRE Were you close to your father? 
Thorgan interrupts over the headset. 
THORGAN(V.O.) Delongpre? What did you do with the chain gun? 
Delongpre frowns. 
DELONGPRE (into mike) It's on the table where I left it! What the hell are you doing?! Hurry up! 
THORGAN(V.O.) I'm on my way. 
BOEMAN(V.O.) Thorgan, quit screwing around and come on! 
THORGAN(V.O.) I'm coming, I'm coming. 
DELONGPRE Sorry, you were saying? 
INT. CARGO BAY 
WATCHER'S POV 
JANESSA approaches the pile of debris where Jason was buried. 
RIZZO(O.S.) I got along great with my father, my mother too. Dad and the others thought they could learn a great deal from this thing the army had been keeping on ice for over a hundred years. 
Janessa moves the debris around with her foot. 
RIZZO(O.S.) They were all wrong. They couldn't control him. 
INT. WALKWAY THREE 
DELONGPRE And what happend to ...? 
Rizzo begins to tear up. 
RIZZO I couldn't save them. 
DELONGPRE Well, we'd be dead without you. You know that, don't you? 
She stares at him. 
DELONGPRE It's true. (chuckles) You caused enough stink that we were at least a little cautious. Of course this is the first field trip I went on that had a body count. 
She gives him a  half smile. 
DELONGPRE I'm not much, but I promise, I won't let this guy get you. 
Another half smile. It's a sweet gesture, but what can this guy really do? 
INT. CARGO BAY 
JASON'S POV 
He watches Janessa from a  distance. Moving slowly and silently toward her. 
She stands and turns as -- 
SERGEANT BRODSKI grabs her! 
She SCREAMS. 
He's covered in blood from a gaping wound in his gut. 
BRODSKI Where is everybody? What happened? 
JANESSA Damnit! You scared the hell out of me! 
BRODSKI Give me a break! What happened? 
JANESSA Jason. He's what happened. Then Grendel hit Space Lab. 
BRODSKI Space Lab?! Wait'll I get my hands on Yllo. 
JANESSA Yllo's dead. We...we thought you were too. 
BRODSKI Takes more than a steelbalde to take this old dog down. 
KA-THUNK! 
JASON"S MACHETE THRUSTS though Brodski's gut. Jason spins Brodski around and tosses him to the floor! 
BRODSKI Yup, that ought'a do it. 
Jason turns on Janessa. 
She stands frozen in fear. 
Jason raises his machete and -- 
JANESSA 
Lights a flare, blinding Jason for the moment. Then she sinks the Rhino syringe into his chest! Jason stumbles...falls hard on his ass and sits there staring at her. 
JANESSA Well go on! Pass out! 
Jason tears the syringe away and tosses it aside. 
JANESSA Shit. 
Jason starts to climb to his feet. Janessa turns to run. 
BRODSKI (weak) He-help me... 
He holds his hand out to her. Then-- 
BOEMAN(V.O.) I'm blowing Walkway One. Hold on. 
KA-FOOM! The SHIP BUCKS! 
Janessa runs, leaving the sergeant behind. 
ON OUR HEROES 
Suddenly there is a GRINDING SOUND. Engines WHINE from behind them. 
The group stops and turns. 
The cargo door is starting to smoke. It SQUEALS as it slowly opens. 
BRODSKI Well fuck me. 
KAY-EM 14 No, fuck me. 
The door opens and Jason steps into the walkway. 
But he's no Jason we've ever seen before. His leg and arm are now SHINY METAL. His clothes are BLACK, no longer tattered. His mask is CHROME. We can't see them, but we know...his insides are in better shape than ever. 
THORGAN Kay-Em? Re-engage killer instinct. 
KAY-EM 14 Yeeee-haw!!!! 
BRAAAATTTTT! 
Kay-em firs. But, this time it doesn't seem to faze Jason. SPARKS fly as bullets vounce off of his metal limbs. 
Jason swings his new improved machete. It CLANGS off of Kay-Em's armor, removing a hunk of metal. 
Jason grabs her and swings her into the glass walkway. Glass CRACKS. One of the wires, connecting two charges severs. 
BOEMAN Shit! 
Kay-em does a back flip, kicking Jason in the chest. He's shoved backwards. 
Boeman attempts to splice the wires back together as the battle ensues. 
IT'S MASSIVE! Intellectual synthetic droid verses psychotic metallic killer. SPARKS FLY. GUNFIRE SOUNDS. Then Kay-Em does a round house kick, but Jason uses his machete as a shield. Kay-Em's leg is nearly sliced off at the knee. 
She stumbles...falls to the ground. 
THORGAN Kay-Em!!! 
Boeman splices the wires together. 
BOEMAN Done!! 
Then turns to see Jason approaching. 
BOEMAN RUN!! 
But Jason's too close. He grabs Boeman. 
ON KAY-EM 
As her body separates from her legs mid-thigh. CHCHHHHH! THRUSTERS IGNITE from her lower thighs. 
As Jason raises his machete to do Boeman in -- 
KA-FWAM! Kay-Em slams into him! Knocking Boeman free. 
Jason and the now hovering Kay-Em go at it again. 
CHANG! CLANG! CLUNK! Metal against metal. Kay-Em hovers up the walls, over Jason's head...but Jason has come into his own with these new body parts. She's no match. Finally -- 
JASON EMBEDS HIS MACHETE IN KAY-EM'S THROAT 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Jason rears back and shoves his fist though Kay-Em's chestplate! his fist from Kay-Em's chest and wraps his metallic hand around he throat. 
THORGAN Kay-Em! Get away! 
Thorgan moves toward his robotic love but Boeman grabs him and pulls him down the hall. 
KAY-EM 14 That's the best you can do? 
Jason yanks his machete from the side of Kay-Em's neck. Severing her head from her body. It flies down the hallway behind the kids. 
KAY-EM 14 Is that it? Come back and fight like a man! 
JASON 
Turns his glare on our heroes racing toward Delongpre at the other end. 
DELONGPRE 
DELONGPRE Done! 
Delongpre lifts his welder's mask to call to the others when he sees JASON. 
DELONGPRE Shit, hurry! 
OUR HEROES 
Run toward the door. But, Thorgan stops. 
BOEMAN What...? 
Thorgan turns, runs back toward Jason. 
BOEMAN What are you doing?!! 
Thorgan is running to retrieve Kay-Em 14's head. It lies between he and Jason. He'll never make it!  Thorgan hits the floor, slides and scoops up the head. 
KAY-EM 14 I think I'm going to throw up... 
BUT IT'S TOO LATE. 
Jason raises his machete from his belt and -- 
RIZZO(O.S.) Hey, dickhead! 
JASON TURNS AS -- 
KA-CHUNG!!!! Rizzo nails him with a metal ar. 
RIZZO (to Thorgan) Go! 
RIZZO Not so bad. 
There's that moment when we think the two might kiss. She takes a step toward him. Yes, they are going to kiss -- 
BOOM! 
WARNING LIGHTS. WARNING ALARMS. The sound of SUCKING WIND. AS JASON, still very alive shoves his fist through the imprinted door with his metal hand! 
As he rips a bigger hole to gain entrance our heroes are fighting to hold on to anything. 
The Hole is sucking everything not tied down out into space. 
Boeman is the first to reach the reactor room door. 
BOEMAN This way! 
He pulls Sergeant Brodski through the door as -- 
JASON 
Fights his way through the opening in the hull. 
The engines BUCK and begin to SMOKE. 
BOEMAN The pressures cause the engines to overheat! Hurry! 
Delongpre helps Rizzo and Thorgan to safety. 
Janessa crawls across the floor digging her fingers into the steel mesh. 
SERGEANT BRODKSI 
Lying in the door's threshold reaches out and snags her hand. 
JANESSA Pull me in! 
BRODSKI I'm pulling, damnit! 
But Jason grabs Janessa's ankle and jerks. She's pulled from the Sergeant's grasp. 
She flops around in the sucking wind as Jason watches. He lets go. 
She flies toward the hole, slams into it. 
Everything goes quiet for a moment. As he body has sealed the hole then 
SHHHHHHHHOOOOOK! 
She's sucked into space in a most grotesque manner. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
BRODSKI Well, that's a shame. 
INT. REACTOR CORE 
Hug cylindrical machines run the length of this enormous room. They HUM quietly as our group enters. 
BRODSKI We need weapons. 
RIZZO Weapons? All this technology and what good has it done?! 
DELONGPRE It bought us some time. 
BOEMAN And now we're all out of it. 
Everyone stares at Boeman. He's standing at another console. 
BOEMAN The ship's depressurizing, the engines overheating. When it  reaches the core, we're done. 
RIZZO Done? 
THORGAN Kaboom. 
DELONGPRE Again?! Jesus! 
RIZZO Why am I not surprised? 
Thorgan still clutches Kay-Em 14's severed head. 
KAY-EM 14 You must shut down the engines. 
DELONGPRE Then do it. The rescue ship can find us here right? 
BRODSKI Can't shut em' down from here. 
BOEMAN Somebody's gonna have to go back to the engine room. 
DELONGPRE You ain't catching my ass in there again. 
Brodski, still bleeding, pale, struggling to stand -- 
BRODSKI I'll go. 
The kids give him the "are you crazy?" stare. 
BOEMAN You're too weak. I'll go. 
KA-FWAM! Everyone jumps but this time it's only Rizzo. She broke a metal stand and has yanked one of the legs free. 
RIZZO You know, this future shit sucks. I'll fucking do it. 
DELONGPRE You? 
RIZZO (mumbling) Wait around on your asses all day. (turns to Thorgan) I'll need a distraction. 
THORGAN What kind of a distraction? 
INT. ENGINE ROOM 
JASON is pounding on the reactor room door. A difficult act with the continued pressure trying to suck him into space. 
THEN RIZZO HEY! 
Jason turns to find Rizzo standing in the doorway behind him. 
No, on second look, it's not exactly the way we remember. The trees are strange looking. Not the Pines and Oaks of Connecticut, but something foreign. The cabins look a little too advanced to be stuck in the middle of a camp. But the image will do. QUICK CUT TO: 
INT.  REACTOR ROOM - DOCKING BAY 
Thorgan stands at a keyboard clicking away. Boeman is wearing a space suit. He's helping sergeatn Brodski into his. 
At the other end of the huge room, Jason wanders ... with confusion. 
THORGAN Don't worry. He can't see us. 
Rizzo glances out the docking bay window. 
RIZZO Is that...? 
THROUGH WINDSHIELD 
We see a planet much the same color as Earth, but the continents are wrong. 
DELONGPRE Earth II. 
BOEMAN(V.O.) Suit up. 
Delongpre leads Rizzo to a suit. 
DELONGPRE I'll help you in. 
THORGAN (into headset) Kay-Em, you've saved our lives, you know that don't you? 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Kay-Em 14's head sits on the floor in the center of room. 
KAY-EM 14 It was my pleasure, my love. Perhaps if all works for the best you can rebuild me and we can try that doggie style thing again. 
DOCKING BAY 
The others stare at Thorgan...he looks embarrassed to say the least. 
DELONGPRE I knew you were a little sick, but Geez. 
ON KAY-EM 
KAY-EM 14 (singing happily) I get no kick from champaign, mere alcohol doesn't faze me at all, but I get a kick out of you. 
THORGAN (under his breath) Goodbye, my love. 
BOEMAN(V.O.) Thorgan, suit up. 
THORGAN (to Rizzo) This is gonna work. If he sticks to the program. Will he? Stick to the program? 
RIZZO His mother was killed before his eyes. That's what drove him insane. It'll work. 
DELONGPRE That sounds like Rizzo having faith in some of that future shit. 
RIZZO Eat me. 
She smiles as she jersk the helmet out of his hand. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Jason slowly walks beside Kay-Em 14. 
QUICK-CUT TO: 
EXT. CAMP CRYSTAL LAKE 
Jason is walking along the lake when he sees -- 
A CAMPFIRE off in the distance. LAUGHTER, SINGING. CAMPERS!!! 
He takes off toward the campfire, then hears -- 
SPLASHING. 
He turns. 
HIS POV 
Within the distorted lake, someone is drowning. Could it be a little boy? A little Jason from many years ago? 
WOMAN Help me! (gurgles) Jason help me! 
JASON 
Moves toward the beach. Steps partly into the water. 
HIS POV 
THE WOMAN, THE VOICE. IT'S JASON'S MOTHER! 
He turns toward the campfire, back to his mother...what to do?! Then -- 
JASON TEARS INTO THE WATER, TRYING TO REACH HER. 
MRS. VOORHEES Help me, Jason, please! Help your mother! 
Jason moves closer. 
MRS. VOORHEES Don't let me die again! 
As he draws near, she reaches out her hands to him. 
JASON 
Pauses staring at the please for help. 
He stares into her pleading face. HIS MOTHER! After all these years! 
He places his hand over her face, gently, then -- 
PUSHES HER UNDER! 
He holds her there. 
QUICK-CUT TO: 
DELONGPRE(V.O.) Don't worry. He can't get through that door. 
Delongpre's right. This isn't some thin interior door or some walkway door reinforced by a high school kid. This is an air lock door. Built to withstand laser cannons and meteors. 
BOEMAN(V.O.) Thrusters. 
CHSHSHSHSH. CHSHSH. 
Our group enters deep space. 
EXT.  WHAT'S LEFT OF GRENDEL 
Rizzo, Thorgan, Boeman and Delongpre look tiny next to the massive right hull. They thrust slowly into space. 
DELONGPRE(V.O.) Rizzo, you okay? 
RIZZO(V.O.) No I'm not okay! I don't know what the hell I'm doing! 
DELONGPRE(V.O.) You're doing fine. I won't let anything happen to you, remember? 
QUICK CUT TO: 
INT. DOCKING BAY 
Jason finally gives up with the massive pounding. He steps back. Turns, stares at the sergeants' dead body, then looks at -- 
THE DOOR PANEL 
He preses the button 
the ari lock door begins to open. Air is suddenly sucked out of the room! 
Sergeant Brodski's body flies out into space. Everything not tied down races out along with him. 
ON KAY-EM 14'S HEAD 
AS it skitters across the floor -- 
KAY-EM 14 Ahhhhh! 
-- and right out the air lock 
JASON 
holds onto a machine until the door is open, then lets go! He shoots out into space. 
EXT. GRENDEL 
Jason flies out of the air lock. 
HIS POV 
He's rocketing right toward one of the space suits! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
DELONGPRE(V.O.) Rizzo, did they have chinese food in your time? 
RIZZO(V.O.) I think I had some when I was eight. 
DELONGPRE(V.O.) Did you like it? 
RIZZO(V.O.) I think so, why? 
THORGAN(V.O.) He's trying to ask you out on a date. 
DELONGPRE(V.O.) Shut up, Thorgan! 
RIZZO(V.O.) Delongpre, you don't even know me. 
DELONGPRE(V.O.) I know you. 
Suddenly Rizzo is SLAMMED from behind. She and Jason go spinning away from the others. 
DELONGPRE(V.O.) Nooooooo!! 
RIZZO 
grapples with Jason, but JASON IS JUST TOO STRONG. 
Jason holds HER with his good hand and REARS his metallic hand back. He's going to punch a hole right through her helmet, most likely throat her head, when -- 
WHAM! 
Delongpre rockets into Jason, but Jason's got one of his arms sticking through one of Rizzo's harnesses. THe three go tumbling. 
Delongpre clings to Jason's back. 
DELONGPRE(V.O.) Rizzo, pull away! 
RIZZO(V.O.) I'm stuck! 
Jason reaches back, grabs Delongpre and jersk him over his head until he's holding Delongpre around the thoat. He'll pop his helmet like a cork! 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
AS Thorgan and Boeman thrust towards the tumbling mass... 
THORGAN(V.O.) We're too far away! 
BACK TO JASON 
AS he tightens his grip around Delongpre's neck. He can't fight back. 
RIZZO is fighting to untangle her harness. We can hear Delongpre CHOKING over the radio. 
The three are spinning even closer and closer towards EARTH II. 
Then, Rizzo reaches down. She grabs Delongpre's leg and CLICKS a button on her sleeve. 
KA-CHSSHSH!!! 
HER AIR TANK BLOWS! 
JASON IS THROWN OFF OF THEM!

FADE IN ON: 
A VIDEO GAME ON A COMPUTER SCREEN 
The game is in progress. As a sick coughing sound is heard. 
CUT TO: 
THIS KID 
lying in bed, coughing. Pale, one sick cookie. Maybe he's seven or eight or nine. He holds a remote in one hand, presses it, and the video game moves a little bit. Then he's hit by another spasm of coughing, puts the remote down. 
His room is monochromatic, greys and blues, mildly high-tech. We're in the present day and this is a middle class house, somewhere in the suburbs. 
CUT TO: 
The Kid's MOTHER as she enters, goes to him, fluffs his pillows, kisses him, and briefly feels his forehead. She's worried, it doesn't show. During this 
MOTHER You feeling any better? 
THE KID A little bit. 
MOTHER Guess what. 
THE KID What? 
MOTHER Your grandfather's here. 
THE KID (not overjoyed) Mom, can't you tell him that I'm sick? 
MOTHER You are sick, that's why he's here. 
THE KID He'll pinch my cheek. I hate that. 
MOTHER Maybe he won't. 
The Kid shoots her an "I'm sure" look, as we 
CUT TO: 
THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursting into the room. Kind of rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as be immediately goes to The Kid, pinches his cheek. 
GRANDFATHER Hey! How's the sickie? Heh? 
The Kid gives his Mother an "I told you so" look. The Mother ignores it, beats a retreat. 
MOTHER I think I'll leave you two pals. 
And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then... 
GRANDFATHER I brought you a special present. 
THE KID What is it? 
GRANDFATHER Open it up. 
The Kid does. He does his best to smile. 
THE KID A book? 
GRANDFATHER That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you. 
THE KID Has it got any sports in it? 
CUT TO: 
THE GRANDFATHER 
Suddenly passionate. 
GRANDFATHER Are you kidding? Fencing. Fighting. Torture. Revenge. Giants. Monsters. Chases. Escapes. True love. Miracles. 
CUT TO: 
THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed. 
THE KID (manages a shrug) It doesn't sound too bad. I'll try and stay awake. 
GRANDFATHER Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right. (Book open now, be begins to read.) The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English countryside. 
GRANDFATHER (off-screen) Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that. (to the kid) Isn't that a wonderful beginning? 
THE KID (off-screen doing his best) Yeah. It's really good. 
HOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
FLORIN CASTLE - DAY 
The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople, livestock, and a bustling marketplace. 
GRANDFATHER (off-screen reading) Five years later, the main square of Florin City was filled as never before to hear the announcement of the great Prince Humperdinck's bride-to be. 
CUT TO: 
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing, standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN. 
HUMPERDINCK (raises his hands, starts to speak) My people ... a month from now, our country will have its 500th anniversary. On that sundown, I shall marry a lady who was once a commoner like yourselves -- (pause) -- but perhaps you will not find her common now. Would you like to meet her? 
And the answering YESSSS booms like summer thunder. 
CUT TO: 
A giant staircase leading to the CROWD and as a FIGURE just begins to become visible, 
CUT TO: 
THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd, collectively, holds its breath. 
CUT TO: 
THE STAIRCASE, as the figure appears in the archway. It is Buttercup. And she resplendent. 
HUMPERDINCK My people ... the Princess Buttercup!! 
She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people. 
CUT TO: 
THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees. Great waves of people kneeling and -- 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her subjects, blinking back tears. HOLD on her beauty for a moment. 
GRANDFATHER (off-screen) Buttercup's emptiness consumed her. Although the law of the land gave Humperdinck the right to choose his bride, she did not love him. 
CUT TO: 
WOODLANDS 
-- and Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse easily. 
GRANDFATHER (off-screen) Despite Humperdinck's reassurance that she would grow to love him, the only joy she found was in her daily ride. 
CUT TO: 
A WOODED GLEN - CLOSE TO SUNDOWN 
Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in. 
VOICE A word, my lady? 
CUT TO: 
THREE MEN, standing close together in the path. Beyond them can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his name is VIZZINI. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as a blade of steel. His name is INIGO MONTOYA. Beside him is a giant. His name is FEZZIK. 
VIZZINI We are but poor, lost circus performers. Is there a village nearby? 
BUTTERCUP There is nothing nearby; not for miles. 
VIZZINI Then there will be no one to hear you scream- 
He nods to the giant, Fezzik, who merely reaches over, touches a nerve on Buttercup's neck, and the start of a scream is all she manages --unconsciousness comes that fast. As she starts to fall -- 
CUT TO: 
A TINY ISOLATED SPOT AT THE EDGE OF FLORIN CHANNEL 
A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long. Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready. 
CUT TO: 
The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board. 
Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision. 
INIGO What is that you're ripping? 
VIZZINI (not stopping or turning) It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder. 
FEZZIK Who's Guilder? 
VIZZINI (pointing straight out) The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. (slaps the horse's rump) Go! 
The horse takes off. They start for the boat. 
VIZZINI Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed. 
FEZZIK You never said anything about killing anyone. 
INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI squinting back, trying desperately to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths. 
CUT TO: 
THE DARKNESS BEHIND THEM 
And there's still nothing to be seen. It's still ominous. Only now it's eerie too. 
Then -- 
The moon slips through and -- 
Inigo was right -- something is very much there. A sailboat. Black. With a great billowing sail. Black. It's a good distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the gap. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO, FEZZIK, AND VIZZINI 
staring at the other boat. 
VIZZINI (explaining with as much logic as he can muster) Probably some local fisherman out for a pleasure cruise at night through eel-infested waters. 
And now as a sound comes from their boat they turn as we 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP, diving into the water, starting to swim away. 
CUT TO: 
THE BOAT 
and Vizzini screaming. 
VIZZINI Go in, get after her! 
INIGO I don't swim. 
FEZZIK (to the unasked question) I only dog paddle. 
VIZZINI Veer left. Left. Left! 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new is heard. A not-too-distant high-pitched shrieking sound. Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water. 
CUT TO: 
THE BOAT 
VIZZINI Do you know what that sound is, Highness? Those are the Shrieking Eels -- if you doubt me, just wait. They always grow louder when they're about to feed on human flesh. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP, treading water, still not far from the boat. The shrieking sounds are getting louder and more terrifying. Buttercup stays silent. 
CUT TO: 
THE BOAT 
VIZZINI If you swim back now, I promise, no harm will come to you. I doubt you will get such an offer from the Eels. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP, and she's a gutsy girl. The shrieking sound is louder still, but she doesn't make a sound. Behind her now, something dark and gigantic slithers past. 
She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply -- 
-- and now a SHRIEKING EEL has zeroed in on her -- 
-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close -- 
-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind -- 
-- and the Eel slithers closer, closer -- 
-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over -- 
-- and now the Eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down -- 
GRANDFATHER (off-screen) She doesn't get eaten by the Eels at this time. 
And the second we hear him: 
CUT TO: 
THE SICK KID'S ROOM 
The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands. 
THE KID What? 
GRANDFATHER The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous. 
THE KID Well, I wasn't nervous. 
CUT TO: 
THE CLIFFS 
The rope goes all the way to the top. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
hurrying to FEZZIK. He straps a harness to him, then lifts Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself gets in the harness. All three are strapped to FEZZIK like papooses. 
And he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along with him as he goes. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK, sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity, watching as FEZZIK rises swiftly through the first moments of dawn. 
CUT TO: 
THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS - LOOKING DOWN 
FEZZIK'S GROUP is only faintly visible far below. This is the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling and it's a gasper. 
CUT TO: 
FEZZIK CLIMBING ON. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear. 
CUT TO: 
THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE CLIFFS 
FEZZIK is moving right along; however high they are, he's already over a third of the way done. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
leaping from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over hand like lightning. 
CUT TO: 
VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS 
INIGO (looking down) He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us. 
VIZZINI Inconceivable! 
He prods FEZZIK, who nods, increases his pace. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
roaring up the rope, and 
CUT TO: 
LONG SHOT - THE CLIFFS 
-- and the Man In Black is cutting deeply into FEZZIK's lead. 
CUT TO: 
VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS 
VIZZINI (shrieking) Faster! 
FEZZIK I thought I was going faster. 
VIZZINI You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains. 
FEZZIK Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself. 
VIZZINI (cutting through) -- I do not accept excuses. (shaking his head) I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all. 
FEZZIK (hurt) Don't say that, Vizzini. Please. 
And his arms begin moving much more slowly. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
His arms still work as before. If anything, he has speeded up. FEZZIK's lead is smaller and smaller 
CUT TO: 
THE VIEW FROM THE TOP OF THE CLIFFS 
Maybe a hundred feet for FEZZIK to go. Maybe more. 
CUT TO: 
VIZZINI AND THE OTHERS, and it's getting too close now. 
VIZZINI Did I make it clear that your job is at stake? 
He watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the Cliffs. He watches a moment, then paces, shaking his hands loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills. He is a taut and nervous fellow, and has never been one for waiting around. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
climbing on. He must be six inches closer to the top than when last we saw him. Inigo is watching. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
walking away. Finally he goes back to cliff edge, starts to talk. It's instant death if the Man In Black falls, but neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our two heroes meeting. They don't know it yet; but that's what it is. 
INIGO (hollering down) Hello there. 
The Man In Black glances up, kind of grunts. 
INIGO Slow going? 
MAN IN BLACK Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me. 
INIGO Sorry. 
MAN IN BLACK Thank you. 
Inigo steps away, draws his sword, loosens up with a few perfect thrusts. Then resheathes and looks eagerly over the edge again. 
INIGO I do not suppose you could speed things up? 
MAN IN BLACK (with some beat) If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. 
INIGO I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you. 
MAN IN BLACK That does put a damper on our relationship. 
He finds another bold a few inches higher. 
INIGO But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top. 
MAN IN BLACK That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait. 
INIGO I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard. 
MAN IN BLACK No good. I've known too many Spaniards. 
And he just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his strength. 
INIGO You don't know any way you'll trust me? 
MAN IN BLACK Nothing comes to mind. 
And on these words, CAMERA ZOOMS into a CLOSE UP on Inigo. He raises his right hand high, his eyes blaze, and his voice takes on a tone we have not heard before. 
INIGO I swear on the soul of my father, Domingo Montoya, you will reach the top alive. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK. 
There is a pause. Then, quietly: 
MAN IN BLACK Throw me the rope. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
He dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
as his grip loosens a moment, trying to cling to the side of the cliff. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and hurls it over -- 
CUT TO: 
THE ROPE 
It hangs close to the Man In Black. He releases the rocks, grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then looks up at Inigo and -- 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
straining, forcing his body away from the cliff edge and -- 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
And he shifts his style now. 
MAN IN BLACK (coping as best he can) -- naturally -- (suddenly shifting again) --but I find Thibault cancels out Capo Ferro, don't you? 
The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated castle ruin. No where to go, he jumps to the sand. 
Inigo stares down at him. 
INIGO Unless the enemy has studied his Agrippa- 
And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and lands facing his opponent. 
INIGO -- which I have. 
The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that. This is two legendary swashbucklers and they're in their prime, it's Burt Lancaster in "The Crimson Pirate" battling Errol Flynn in "Robin Hood" and then, incredibly, the action begins going even faster than before as we 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death. 
INIGO (happy as a clam) You are wonderful! 
MAN IN BLACK Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so. 
The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being forced toward it. 
INIGO I admit it -- you are better than I am. 
MAN IN BLACK Then why are you smiling? 
Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles. 
INIGO Because I know something you don't know. 
MAN IN BLACK And what is that? 
INIGO I am not left-handed. 
And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and immediately, the tide of battle turns. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
stunned, doing everything be can to keep Inigo by the Cliff edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
and the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again. 
CUT TO: 
A ROCKY STAIRCASE leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop Inigo -- nothing can stop Inigo -- and in a frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left. But he fails. Everything fails. He tries one or two final desperate moves but they are nothing. 
MAN IN BLACK You're amazing! 
INIGO I ought to be after twenty years. 
And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar, pinned there under the six fingered sword. 
MAN IN BLACK (hollering it out) There's something I ought to tell you. 
INIGO Tell me. 
MAN IN BLACK I am not left-handed either. 
And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully joined. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps. He tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing -- the Man In Black seems to be in control. And before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked clear out of his hand. 
Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and scrambles to his sword and we 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
who watches Inigo, then casually tosses his sword to the landing where it sticks in perfectly. Then the Man In Black copies INIGO. Not copies exactly, improves. 
He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus performer and dismounts with a backflip. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
staring in awe. 
INIGO Who are you?! 
MAN IN BLACK No one of consequence. 
Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he rounds the bend -- a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a boulder inches in front of him. 
CUT TO: 
FEZZIK 
He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another rock and holds it lightly. 
FEZZIK I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss. 
MAN IN BLACK I believe you -- So what happens now? 
FEZZIK We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone. 
MAN IN BLACK You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people? 
FEZZIK (gently) I could kill you now. 
He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head, takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward the Giant. 
MAN IN BLACK Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting. 
FEZZIK It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. 
He flips the rock away. 
CUT TO: 
THE MOUNTAIN PATH AND THE TWO MEN 
The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so much. 
There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any number of terrific wrestling moves. 
FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery. Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at the Giant. 
MAN IN BLACK Look are you just fiddling around with me or what? 
FEZZIK I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed. 
They get set to begin again. Then suddenly -- 
CUT TO: 
FEZZIK 
as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs. 
FEZZIK You're quick. 
MAN IN BLACK And a good thing too. 
FEZZIK (getting set for another onslaught) Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? 
MAN IN BLACK Oh no. It's just that they're terribly comfortable. I think everyone will be wearing them in the future. 
FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter. 
FEZZIK (standing, talking as he does so) I just figured out why you give me so much trouble. 
CUT TO: 
FEZZIK 
as he charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe. 
MAN IN BLACK (his arms never leave Fezzik's throat) Why is that, do you think? 
FEZZIK (his voice just beginning to get a little strained) Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing. 
CUT TO: 
ANOTHER HUGE ROCK ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PATH 
Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on. 
MAN IN BLACK Why should that make such a difference? 
FEZZIK Well ... (And now his voice is definitely growing weaker) ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one. 
Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and Fezzik starts to slowly collapse. 
CUT TO: 
FEZZIK 
BUTTERCUP (stares at him) I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything. 
The Man In Black says nothing. 
BUTTERCUP You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it. 
MAN IN BLACK (bowing) With pride. What can I do for you? 
BUTTERCUP You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces. 
MAN IN BLACK Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me? 
CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now. 
BUTTERCUP You killed my love. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
watching her closely. 
MAN IN BLACK It's possible; I kill a lot of people. Who was this love of yours? Another Prince, like this one, ugly, rich, and scabby? 
BUTTERCUP No. A farm boy. Poor. Poor and perfect, with eyes like the sea after a storm. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be tears. 
BUTTERCUP On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners. 
MAN IN BLACK (explaining as a teacher might) I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time. 
BUTTERCUP You mock my pain! 
MAN IN BLACK Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago? 
Buttercup nods. 
MAN IN BLACK Does it bother you to hear? 
BUTTERCUP Nothing you can say will upset me. 
MAN IN BLACK He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory. (MORE) 
MAN IN BLACK (CONT'D) I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are. 
BUTTERCUP And what am I? 
MAN IN BLACK Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead? 
BUTTERCUP You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day! 
The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his attention and as he stares at it briefly, 
CUT TO: 
HIS P.O.V.: 
The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up into the sky. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high, she pushes him with all the strength she has. 
BUTTERCUP You can die too, for all I care!! 
CUT TO: 
THE MAN IN BLACK 
teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins to fall. Down goes the Man In Black. 
Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward the flat rock floor of the ravine. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
staring transfixed at what she has wrought. 
There is a long pause. She stands there, alone, as from far below the words come to her, drifting on the wind -- 
MAN IN BLACK ... as ... you ... wish... 
BUTTERCUP Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done? 
And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers, she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn, cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved. 
CUT TO: 
THE DUST CLOUD 
Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but he moves jauntily along, sword in hand. 
WESTLEY It's not that bad. I'm not saying I'd like to build a summer home here, but the trees are actually quite lovely. 
THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun. 
A GIANT SPURT OF FLAME leaps up, preceded by a slight popping sound, and this particular spurt of flame misses Westley, but Buttercup is suddenly onfire; at least the lower half of her is and -- 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire. This isn't all that easy and it causes him a bit of grief, but he does his best to sound as jaunty as before. 
WESTLEY Well now, that was an adventure. 
He examines where the flames burst over her. 
WESTLEY Singed a bit, were you? 
BUTTERCUP (She wasn't and she shakes her head "no") You? 
He was, and he shakes his head "no." As he pulls her to her feet -- 
CUT TO: 
THE SWAMP FLOOR 
-- and as there's another popping sound, 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY GRABBING BUTTERCUP 
pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame suddenly shoots up. 
WESTLEY Well, one thing I will say. The Fire Swamp certainly does keep you on your toes. 
Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently leads her forward as we- 
CUT TO: 
THE TWO OF THEM 
moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of the Fire Swamp. 
It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different angle. 
WESTLEY (happily) This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts. 
BUTTERCUP But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago? 
WESTLEY I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. 
There is again a popping sound, then a huge spurt of flame. Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking without missing a beat. 
WESTLEY You see, what I told you before about saying "please" was true. It intrigued Roberts, as did my descriptions of your beauty. 
CUT TO: 
SOME HIDEOUS VINES -- 
they look like they could be flesh eating. Westley takes his sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time. 
WESTLEY Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened. 
BUTTERCUP What? -- go on -- 
Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch. 
WESTLEY Well, Roberts had grown so rich, he wanted to retire. So he took me to his cabin and told me his secret. "I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts," he said. "My name is Ryan. I inherited this ship from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from was not the real Dread Pirate Roberts, either. (MORE) 
WESTLEY (CONT'D) His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts has been retired fifteen years and living like a king in Patagonia." Then he explained the name was the important thing for inspiring the necessary fear. You see, no one would surrender to the Dread Pirate Westley. 
The two of them have by now crossed the pond. 
WESTLEY So we sailed ashore, took on an entirely new crew and he stayed aboard for awhile as first mate, all the time calling me Roberts. Once the crew believed, he left the ship and I have been Roberts ever since. Except, now that we're together, I shall retire and hand the name over to someone else. Is everything clear to you? 
Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way -- it's Lightning Sand -- a great patch of it, and it has her -- a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is gone as we -- 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY WHIRLING 
slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half -- it's still connected to the tree. Then be grabs it, drops his sword, and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder, but it settles quickly. 
Now nothing can be seen. Nothing at all. Just the lightning sand, lovely and lethal. 
HOLD ON THE LIGHTNING SAND -- THEN -- 
An odd panting sound is heard now. The panting sound is suddenly very loud. And then a giant R.0.U.S. darts into view. The R.0.U.S. -- a Rodent of Unusual Size -- is probably no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes. 
CUT TO: 
THE LIGHTNING SAND 
as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine -- 
THE FAR EDGE OF THE FIRE SWAMP 
Beyond, a beach. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY 
BUTTERCUP (almost in disbelief) We did it. 
WESTLEY Now, was that so terrible? 
And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace, and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp -- 
CUT TO: 
SOMETHING WE HADN'T EXPECTED: 
Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS, armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. Buttercup and Westley are at the edge of the Fire Swamp, about to leave it. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion. Westley looks worse. 
HUMPERDINCK Surrender! 
It's dusk. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay. 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP 
staring out at the others. 
WESTLEY You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept. 
HUMPERDINCK I give you full marks for bravery --don't make yourself a fool. 
WESTLEY Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit. 
HUMPERDINCK I tell you once again -- surrender! 
WESTLEY It will not happen! 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
looking from one to the other; then something else catches her eye and we -- 
CUT TO: 
AN ARMED WARRIOR 
in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
looking the other way -- 
CUT TO: 
ANOTHER WARRIOR 
crossbow aimed at Westley. 
HUMPERDINCK (roaring) For the last time -- SURRENDER! 
WESTLEY (roaring right back, bigger) DEATH FIRST!! 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
frantically staring around, and now 
CUT TO: 
A THIRD WARRIOR 
crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a tree blocking any escape Westley might try. 
BUTTERCUP Will you promise not to hurt him? 
CUT TO: 
HUMPERDINCK 
whirling to face her. 
HUMPERDINCK What was that? 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
whirling to face her. 
WESTLEY What was that? 
with numbers ranging from a low of "1" to a high of "50." Rugen goes to it. 
RUGEN This being our first try, I'll use the lowest setting. 
And he turns the dial to "1". 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of himself 
CUT TO: 
COUNT RUGEN 
fiddling with his Machine a moment more. And then he opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going. 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them. A terrible sound comes from his throat, an incessant gasping. It keeps on coming as we finally 
CUT TO: 
COUNT RUGEN 
He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and pen, sits in a chair. The NOISE of The Machine subsides. Rugen opens the book to a blank page. 
RUGEN As you know, the concept of the suction pump is centuries old. Well, really, that's all this is. Except that instead of sucking water, I'm sucking life. I've just sucked one year of your life away. I might one day go as high as five, but I really don't know what that would do to you. So, let's just start with what we have. What did this do to you? Tell me. And remember, this is for posterity, so be honest -- how do you feel? 
AND NOW, AT LAST: 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries. 
Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write. 
RUGEN Interesting. 
CUT TO: 
HUMPERDINCK 
in his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all over. Now YELLIN, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in the doorway. 
HUMPERDINCK Yellin. 
YELLIN (bows, then kneels) Sire. 
HUMPERDINCK As Chief Enforcer of all Florin, I trust you with this secret: killers from Guilder are infiltrating the Thieves' Forest and plan to murder my bride on our wedding night. 
YELLIN My spy network has heard no such news. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
entering. 
BUTTERCUP Any word from Westley? 
CUT TO: 
THE PRINCE AND YELLIN 
turning to her in the doorway. 
HUMPERDINCK Too soon, my angel. Patience. 
BUTTERCUP He will come for me. 
HUMPERDINCK Of course. 
As she glides out-- 
HUMPERDINCK She will not be murdered. On the day of the wedding, I want the Thieves' Forest emptied and every inhabitant arrested. 
YELLIN Many of the thieves will resist. My regular enforcers will be inadequate. 
HUMPERDINCK Form a Brute Squad then. I want the Thieves' Forest emptied before I wed. 
YELLIN It won't be easy, Sire. 
HUMPERDINCK (alone, exhausted) Try ruling the world sometime. 
CUT TO: 
THE THIEVES' FOREST - DAY 
A lot of hollering is going on. The THIEVES are being rounded up by the BRUTE SQUAD, a large group of large men. Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling. 
GRANDFATHER (off-screen) The day of the wedding arrived. The Brute Squad had their hands full carrying out Humperdinck's orders. 
INIGO -- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go -- 
FEZZIK -- where? 
INIGO To find the Man in Black, obviously. 
FEZZIK But you don't know where he is. 
INIGO (he is possessed by demons now) Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP - INIGO 
INIGO (big) There will be blood tonight!! 
CUT TO: 
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK'S CHAMBERS 
-- strewn with maps, etc. Yellin enters, and kneels. 
HUMPERDINCK (sharpening his dagger) Rise and report. 
YELLIN The Thieves' Forest is emptied. Thirty men guard the castle gate. 
HUMPERDINCK Double it. My Princess must be safe. 
YELLIN The gate has but one key, and I carry that. 
He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck. Just at that moment, Buttercup enters. 
HUMPERDINCK Ah! My dulcet darling. Tonight we marry. Tomorrow morning, your men will escort us to Florin Channel where every ship in my armada waits to accompany us on our honeymoon. 
BUTTERCUP Every ship but your four fastest, you mean. 
The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment. 
BUTTERCUP Every ship but the four you sent. 
HUMPERDINCK Yes. Yes, of course. Naturally, not those four. 
YELLIN (bows, exits) Your Majesties. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
staring at Humperdinck. 
BUTTERCUP You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway. 
HUMPERDINCK (sharply) You're a silly girl. 
BUTTERCUP Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear. 
HUMPERDINCK (close to erupting; speaks very distinctly) I-would-not-say-such things-if- Iwere-you- 
BUTTERCUP Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth. 
CUT TO: 
HUMPERDINCK 
jumping at her, yanking her by the hair, starting to pull her along, out of control, his words indistinct. 
HUMPERDINCK IWOULDNOTSAYSUCHTHINGSIFIWEREYOU! 
CUT TO: 
A CORRIDOR OF THE CASTLE 
as the Prince throws open the door to Buttercup's room, slams it shut, locks it, breaks into a wild run and -- 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY IN THE MACHINE 
but it's not on. Count Rugen is adding more notes to his book. He looks up as the Prince suddenly comes down the steps, raging. 
HUMPERDINCK (at Westley) You truly love each other, and so you might have been truly happy. Not one couple in a century has that chance, no matter what the storybooks say. And so I think no man in a century will suffer as greatly as you will. 
And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the lever and -- 
CUT TO: 
COUNT RUGEN 
calling out -- 
RUGEN Not to fifty!!! 
But it's too late as we -- 
CUT TO: 
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK 
as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword held in his hands. 
Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind. 
CUT TO: 
THE SECRET KNOT 
that reveals the staircase. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it. 
Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen. Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot and -- 
Nothing. He has failed. 
In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each other, then start down. 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head. 
FEZZIK He's dead. 
Inigo is in despair. For a moment, he just sags. 
INIGO (barely able to speak) It just is not fair. 
THE KID (off-screen) -- Grandpa, Grandpa -- wait -- 
CUT TO: 
THE KID'S ROOM 
He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet seen him. 
THE KID -- wait -- what did FEZZIK mean, "He's dead?" I mean he didn't mean dead. 
The Grandfather says nothing, just sits there. 
THE KID Westley's only faking, right? 
GRANDFATHER You want me to read this or not? 
CUT TO: 
THE KID: CLOSE UP 
THE KID Who gets Humperdinck? 
GRANDFATHER I don't understand. 
THE KID Who kills Prince Humperdinck? At the end, somebody's got to do it. Is it Inigo? Who? 
GRANDFATHER Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. 
THE KID You mean he wins? Jesus, Grandpa! What did you read me this thing for? 
And he desperately fights for control. 
GRANDFATHER You know, you've been very sick and you're taking this story very seriously. I think we better stop now. 
He closes the book and starts to get up. 
THE KID (shaking his head) No! I'm okay. I'm okay. (gestures toward the chair) -- sit down. All right? 
GRANDFATHER Okay. (sitting and opening the book again) All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO, IN DESPAIR 
We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before. For a moment, he just sags. 
INIGO Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body. 
FEZZIK The body? 
INIGO (not stopping) Have you any money? 
FEZZIK I have a little. 
INIGO I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. 
As Fezzik takes the corpse, follows Inigo up the stairs -- 
CUT TO: 
A HOVEL - DUSK 
Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. From inside the hovel a little man's voice is heard. If Mel Brooks' Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her. 
HUMPERDINCK You don't seem excited, my little muffin. 
BUTTERCUP Should I be? 
HUMPERDINCK Brides often are, I'm told. 
BUTTERCUP (gently, confidently) I do not marry tonight. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
and she couldn't seem more serene. 
BUTTERCUP My Westley will save me. 
CUT TO: 
HER WESTLEY 
looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE 
-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes. 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK 
looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake hands. 
Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's. 
CUT TO: 
AN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing CLERGYMAN imaginable. 
Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the back is Count Rugen. 
FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door. 
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN (clears his throat, begins to speak) Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings us togewer today... 
He has an impediment that would stop a clock. 
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement, that dweam wiffim a dweam... 
And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a commotion. And then-- 
YELLIN (off-screen) Stand your ground, men. Stand your ground. 
CUT TO: 
THE BRUTES AND YELLIN 
by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the commotion, frightened, pointing. 
YELLIN Stand your ground. 
CUT TO: 
THEIR P.O.V.: 
And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls. 
FEZZIK (deep and booming) I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS. THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS. 
CUT TO: 
FEZZIK 
and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley. 
INIGO Now? 
WESTLEY Not yet. 
CUT TO: 
THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER 
pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and FEZZIK close in. 
WESTLEY Give us the gate key. 
YELLIN (every ounce of honesty he's got) I have no gate key. 
INIGO Fezzik, tear his arms off. 
FEZZIK 
steps toward him. 
YELLIN Oh, you mean this gate key. 
And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik. 
CUT TO: 
HUMPERDINCK AND BUTTERCUP 
AND THE IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN 
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN And do you, Pwincess Buwwercwup... 
HUMPERDINCK Man and wife -- say man and wife... 
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN Man and wife. 
HUMPERDINCK (whirling to the King and Queen) Escort the bride to the Honeymoon Suite -- I'll be there shortly. 
And as he dashes off -- 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
standing there. Dazed. 
BUTTERCUP He didn't come. 
CUT TO: 
COUNT RUGEN AND HIS FOUR WARRIORS 
racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous, as we 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY, INIGO, AND FEZZIK 
moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog leash --Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it. 
CUT TO: 
COUNT RUGEN 
as the confrontation is about to start. 
RUGEN Kill the dark one and the giant, but leave the third for questioning. 
And as his Warriors attack -- 
Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe they're even better than that -- but they never get a chance to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and the FOURTH WARRIOR is dead before the FIRST ONE has even hit the floor. There is a pause. Then -- 
INIGO (to Rugen, evenly and soft) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. 
CUT TO: 
COUNT RUGEN 
For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen, running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He tries again. No kind of chance. 
INIGO (calling out) Fezzik, I need you -- 
CUT TO: 
FEZZIK WITH WESTLEY 
who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls back -- 
FEZZIK (indicating Westley) I can't leave him alone. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
desperately pounding at the heavy door. 
INIGO He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK! 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY There's a shortage of perfect breasts in this world. It would be a pity to damage yours. 
And Buttercup whirls as we -- 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice sounds just fine, but he does not move. 
Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses. Westley is helpless. 
BUTTERCUP Oh, Westley, darling. (more kisses) Westley, why won't you hold me? 
WESTLEY (gently) Gently. 
BUTTERCUP At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?" 
WESTLEY (not so gently) Gently!! 
And she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard and 
CUT TO: 
COUNT RUGEN 
looking very much surprised. 
RUGEN Good heavens. Are you still trying to win? 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
Inigo, struggling feebly, pulling the dagger from his stomach. Holding the wound with his left hand. 
Rugen is pushing off from the table, sword in hand, moving in to kill Inigo. 
RUGEN You've got an overdeveloped sense of vengeance. It's going to get you into trouble some day. 
Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do, just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left shoulder. 
Inigo doesn't seem to feel it, his other agonies are so much worse. 
CUT TO: 
THE COUNT 
stepping back, going for the heart again. 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
And as this blow comes he's trying to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it. 
CUT TO: 
COUNT RUGEN 
stepping back forj ust a moment, watching as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise and 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
slowly pushing away from the wall. 
INIGO (all but audible) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father; prepare to die. 
CUT TO: 
COUNT RUGEN 
suddenly going into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo easily back, drives him easily into the wall. But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment -- 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
pushing slowly off from the wall again. 
INIGO (a little louder) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya, you killed my father, prepare to die. 
CUT TO: 
THE COUNT 
And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves forward. 
INIGO (a little louder still) Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die. 
RUGEN Stop saying that! 
CUT TO: 
COUNT RUGEN 
retreating more quickly around the table. 
HUMPERDINCK That may be the first time in my life a man has dared insult me. 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first. 
WESTLEY It won't be the last. To the pain means the first thing you lose will be your feet, below the ankles, then your hands at the wrists, next your nose. 
CUT TO: 
HUMPERDINCK 
gripping his sword, watching. 
HUMPERDINCK -- and then my tongue, I suppose. I killed you too quickly the last time, a mistake I don't mean to duplicate tonight. 
WESTLEY I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right -- 
HUMPERDINCK (takes step forward) -- and then my ears, I understand. Let's get on with it 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE UP: WESTLEY HUGE 
WESTLEY Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why -- 
CUT TO: 
HUMPERDINCK 
And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return. 
WESTLEY -- so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish -- every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, "Dear God, what is that thing?" will echo in your perfect ears. (MORE) 
WESTLEY (CONT'D) That is what "to the pain" means. It means I leave you in anguish, wallowing in freakish misery forever. 
CUT TO: 
HUMPERDINCK 
doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him. 
HUMPERDINCK I think you're bluffing -- 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
lying there, staring at him. 
WESTLEY It's possible, pig -- I might be bluffing -- it's conceivable, you miserable vomitous mass, that I'm only lying here because I lack the strength to stand -- then again, perhaps I have the strength after all. 
And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his feet go to the floor, he starts to stand -- 
CUT TO: 
HUMPERDINCK 
staring, eyes wide. 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
And now he is standing, sword in fighting position. 
WESTLEY (slow and determined) DROP-YOUR-SWORD. 
CUT TO: 
PRINCE HUMPERDINCK 
and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind his watch. He throws his sword to the floor. 
WESTLEY (to Humperdinck) Have a seat. 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY 
speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits. 
WESTLEY Tie him up. Make it as tight as you like. 
And as she sets to work -- 
CUT TO: 
INIGO 
entering, looking around. 
INIGO Where's Fezzik? 
WESTLEY I thought he was with you.

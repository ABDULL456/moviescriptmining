FADE IN: 
CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S LEG 
A nervous leg shakes under the table. The appendage seems to be attached to someone who has a lot on their mind. 
INT. CAFE-DAY 
LOUIS, a college student in his late twenties stares at a friend who is sitting off screen. Louis is calm, almost villainous in how collective he is. 
He stares at this unseen friend, trying to assess the cause for his anxious state. 
LOUIS (smug) Something is bothering you... 
We finally see QUINN, also in his late twenties. He is obviously uneasy about being out in public with this person. 
QUINN I appreciate the faux concern but I'm fine. 
Louis is taken aback. 
LOUIS My concern is genuine... 
QUINN With our history can you honestly say you care about my well being? 
LOUIS Yes I can, our connection is a product of destiny. I have no ill-will against you. 
Quinn scoffs. 
QUINN 
LOUIS -The Stephen Speilberg film? 
QUINN No, there was that little French girl I liked. You..you violated her and torched her farm killing her family- 
LOUIS -Actually you are jacking up the story, I violated her father in front of her...then I torched the farm. 
QUINN Well...that makes it ten times better. 
LOUIS Quinn that was war, people do crazy things midst of wide spread conflict. I have gotten jaded over time. It's not like the dark ages when I had style. 
QUINN When you would rape the horses and ride away on the women? 
LOUIS Yeah I was such a ham. (beat) Quinn, this is what we do. I have gotten carried away in the past, but now I'm tired. I just want to get this over with. It's our calling, we help bring order and balance to the universe. (beat) Maybe I would feel less removed if you would let me win just once. 
QUINN This isn't a 1930's boxing match. If I take dive, I'm not lining the pockets of some bookie...I'm bringing on the apocalypse. Louis takes a drink of his coffee. 
LOUIS See at least our obligation would be over. 
RICK Oh well...so do you want to see what I'm doing on the computer? 
Zoey feels like she has broken down the "wall". 
ZOEY Yes...of course! 
Rick spins the computer around. 
RICK Check that out Lloyd Dobler. 
ZOEY (Shocked) Is that...porn? 
RICK Red Tube...like You Tube...but with porn. 
ZOEY Um.... (lightbulb) wait...is that? 
RICK Oh yes... 
ZOEY Us having sex? 
RICK Oh yeah... 
Rick reaches over and points at the laptop screen. 
RICK (CONT'D) I love the part coming up. (beat) You know where I put your legs behind your head and yell "hump bunny!" 
ZOEY Yeah...um...I'm not OK with this... RICK Yeah...OK...I'm also breaking up with you. 
ZOEY What?- 
RICK -Yeah not working any more for me- 
ZOEY What the hell?!? How is it not working?!? 
RICK You are yelling...you know I don't like confrontational situations. 
ZOEY I'm not trying to be confrontational...I just...you are breaking up with me? 
RICK -Yeah...Can I have my laptop back now? 
Zoey, still confused, slowly turns the laptop back toward Rick. 
RICK (CONT'D) (looking at the screen) This part is fucking priceless. 
Zoey is bewildered. 
EXT. PARK-AFTERNOON 
Louis kicks at the ground, almost as if he was searching for something. His foot finally rests on a broken tree limb. 
He places his foot under it and kicks it up to his right hand. 
LOUIS This will do. 
The boy is now doing the same to Zoey. 
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) -This put you right in the cross-hairs to be his next victim. 
ZOEY 13 YEARS OLD 
ZACK, a young teenager is selling drugs on the street corner. His bags of coke should be exaggerated, as well as the customers coming up to buy from him. Think if South Park was crossed with HBO's The Wire. 
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Good old Zack the neighbourhood drug dealer- Zoey takes Zack into a room labeled "Rehab" on the door. 
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) -You took it upon yourself to be his personal savoir. What did it get you? 
Zack is out with Zoey when a few of his old GANG FRIENDS show up looking to collect. Zack opens his pockets to show he doesn't have any dough on him. 
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) Well when Zach's old business partners wanted to collect on a debt- 
Zack slowly pushes Zoey toward them. 
A few days later we see Zoey being used as a human coffee table as the gang uses her back to cut cocaine. 
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) - they used you to replace their missing coffee table they broke during a drunken party. 
ZOEY 17 YEARS OLD. 
A gang member looks directly into the camera. He smiles showing his golden grille. 
ANNA (V.O.) (CONT'D) -And then you have Toothpick. What kind of name is Toothpick? 
ZOEY (V.O.) It was his gang name. 
ANNA (V.O.) Of course. 
It's prom night and Toothpick is in his "pimp" tux. He takes a swig of his "40" while he dances with Zoey. 
ANNA (CONT'D) We won't talk about prom night. Needless to say it wasn't romantic. 
Toothpick and Zoey are in an hotel room. Toothpick is standing over Zoey, who is facedown on the bed. It appears he is urinating on her. It's hard to tell with the black censor bar. 
END SEQUENCE BACK TO: 
PARK-RIVERSIDE-PRESENT DAY 
ZOEY Exaggerations- 
ANNA -Accurate account of events... The story of your romantic life- 
ZOEY -Unfair. Because these people need someone who is going to sacrifice their own needs for them. 
ANNA Why? 
ZOEY Who else is going to do it? We're alone in the universe. If we are going to make it through this "crazy world" we need to look out for each other. 
ANNA I think you use atheism and the whole "we are alone in the universe" jive to justify your actions. (beat) I regret taking you to see Dawkins because you use that as a fall back to be codependent. 
CLOSE UP-HAND 
As her hand opens a class ring was digging into her palm. It appears this might have belonged to Rick. 
PARK-RIVERSIDE 
Still teary eyed, Zoey angrily throws the ring toward the river. A gust of wind causes the ring to curve and it slams into the temple of a man sitting on a park bench. 
Zoey walks over to apologize and meets Quinn for the first time. 
ZOEY (making her way to the bench) I'm so sorry Quinn rubs his temple and then reaches down to pick up the ring. 
QUINN (handing the ring back to her) Is this yours? 
She takes the ring and shoves it into her pocket. 
ZOEY Kinda... Again I'm so sorry. 
QUINN No need to apologize. 
Quinn scoots over and motions for her to sit. 
QUINN (CONT'D) Do you want to sit? 
ZOEY (unsure) OK? 
Zoey sits, still apprehensive. 
ZOEY (CONT'D) (reaching her hand out) I'm Zoey. 
QUINN (He returns the gesture) Quinn. (beat) Zoey? Interesting. 
ZOEY Oh name? Yes, most people have interesting stories behind their names...Honestly I have nothing. Not sure why my parents did that. 
QUINN Very unique. 
ZOEY (smiles) I suppose that's a compliment. So I've seen you around school, but never really...in...class... 
QUINN I don't go to Marshall, I live near the campus though. 
ZOEY Oh, well so what do you do? 
QUINN As in profession? I don't really have one. 
ZOEY Really? Rent is insane around here... 
QUINN Yeah, my father provides for me. 
ZOEY That's pretty cool. What's he into? 
QUINN Everything. 
ZOEY An entrepreneur...That's awesome. (beat) Well...So do you like coming down here? 
We follow Anna across the room where she plops herself down on the couch. 
ANNA I promised her we would behave. 
A KNOCK is heard at the front door. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Although knocking right as I sat down doesn't endear him to me... 
Jack gets up from the desk. 
JACK You sit your pretty little ass down hooker. 
Anna adjusts herself back down into the comfy couch. 
ANNA This is why I don't need a boyfriend. You are way to good to me. 
Jack opens the door to reveal Quinn. 
JACK Look at this mother fucker. 
He rudely motions him to come in and sit down. 
JACK (CONT'D) Zoey is in the bathroom getting ready for a night of manipulation, sit the fuck down. 
QUINN (confused) Um...OK? 
In almost the same beat, Zoey walks into the room. 
ZOEY Quinn, is he being rude? 
QUINN (looking at Jack) No quite pleasant. 
Zoey reaches out her hand to help Quinn off the couch. 
ZOEY Let's go. 
JACK (looking at Quinn) I will call the state police in a fucking heart beat if she isn't here by midnight. 
QUINN (still confused) OK? 
Anna grabs the remote trying to ignore the situation. 
ZOEY Anna, you going to call the guard dog off? 
ANNA (out of it) David Smith's Candytakers is on tonight. I'm relaxing and not getting in the middle. 
QUINN (To Jack and Anna) Nice meeting both of you. 
JACK Get the fuck out. 
ZOEY (to Jack and Anna) Don't wait up 
Zoey and Quinn leave the apartment as Jack stares daggers. 
QUINN (laughs) What? 
ZOEY Have you thought about St John's Wort? 
QUINN You are a very cryptic speaker. ZOEY No I'm thinking out loud mostly. I was just...well...you have some social awkwardness. 
QUINN OK? 
ZOEY Well you are latching on to religion to make you feel whole. It doesn't make you feel whole, or at least as whole as you thought it would- 
QUINN You are kind of right on that one. 
ZOEY So you are out with me...I represent everything you were brought up to combat. You're missing something and you are looking for help. 
QUINN I am looking for help. I'm out with you though because I'm interested in getting to know you. 
ZOEY (smiles) See I'm good at reading people. 
QUINN (rolls eyes, smiles) Kind of. 
ZOEY I don't know Quinn you seem like a lost soul. I thought that when I saw you by the river. 
QUINN You like lost souls don't you? 
ZOEY Yeah I actually do. Someone needs to save them. 
QUINN You going to save me? 
ZOEY If you let me. QUINN I think you might be able to. 
ZOEY (endearing smile) So what do you need Quinn? 
QUINN (smiles) Dessert. 
INT.   ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-LATER 
Jack is passed out drooling on the couch. Anna and Zoey are cross legged on the floor in the midst of "girl talk". 
ANNA I don't know, he seems fishy. 
ZOEY He seems harmless. 
ANNA I have heard that a million times. 
ZOEY I know. He's in the ministry- 
ANNA -and you hate organized religion. 
ZOEY I know and he's understanding of that. 
ANNA Plus it's to my understanding he didn't actually admit what he did. He just did a bunch of double talk. 
ZOEY It was understood. 
TREE 
From behind a tree we see RYAN BLOOD for the first time. He hides in the shadows taking pictures with his digital camera. 
Quinn and Louis continue to practice unaware of the unwanted attention. 
INT. CAFE-DAY 
Louis sips his coffee, while Quinn just stares out the front window. It almost as if he is searching for something. 
LOUIS You have not been lively at all this go around. 
QUINN A lot on my mind... 
LOUIS We only do this once every seventy years brother. You have to enjoy it while it lasts. QUINN Louis our whole purpose here, is to show up, and over time establish a social base, and then kill each other. 
LOUIS You know and I'm very good at the social base part, and you are not so good... 
QUINN That's because you find a way to screw it up every time. 
LOUIS That's because, I know this is news to you, I represent evil. (MORE) 
LOUIS (CONT'D) Here's the thing though, I'm tired Quinn. I really want to stop being the ambassador for this. 
QUINN That's something we agree on. I'm tired too. 
LOUIS I don't know if we can get off this train. It's just a viscous cycle. 
QUINN Letting you win is not an option. 
LOUIS I wasn't going there... (beat) ...yet. 
INT. ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EVENING 
Quinn is sitting on the couch as Jack and Anna make their way for the door. 
ZOEY (O.S.) You guys leaving? 
Zoey comes out of the kitchen with a bowl of popcorn. 
JACK Yeah we don't want to interrupt your "date rape". 
Anna hits Jack. ANNA Jesus Jack! He can't do anything here anyway. Too much exposure. Witnesses my friend...We knew he was here. 
Zoey sits down and hands the bowl to Quinn. 
ZOEY Will you guys stop?? 
QUINN It's OK. I like your friends. 
Anna walks over to the couch. 
ANNA So Quinn? 
ZOEY This might be a little hard-core for your first film. 
QUINN No it's OK. I'm excited. 
Zoey shakes her head. 
ZOEY I feel like I'm stealing your virginity here. 
Zoey slowly looks over at Quinn. 
ZOEY (CONT'D) You're a virgin too aren't you? 
Quinn shrugs 
ZOEY (CONT'D) Oh my god! I'm a bad girl. 
Quinn puts his hand on her shoulder. 
QUINN (smiles) You are not. 
Quinn motions to the TV. 
QUINN (CONT'D) Please play the film. 
ZOEY (hesitant) OK? I mean I usually play this for potential boyfriends. If they can handle this, they can handle me. 
Zoey hits play on the remote. 
ZOEY (CONT'D) I guess you're lucky I thought about "They Call Her One Eye". (to herself) I hope this doesn't jack you up. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: 3 DAYS LEFT 
EXT. OPEN FIELD-DAY 
Quinn is sitting cross legged in the middle of the field. He seems as though he is in the middle of a trance. 
QUINN (monotone) I am curious Yellow... 
Louis walks up and throws a toy sword on Quinn's lap. 
LOUIS What the hell are you talking about? 
Quinn stands up and grabs the sword. 
QUINN Nothing really. 
The two start to sword fight, but Quinn does not have his heart in it. 
LOUIS You half asleep Quinn? 
Quinn stops for a second and drops his sword down to his side. Louis pokes Quinn in the chest with the tip of his sword. 
He walks up to a mirror and starts looking at himself. 
LOUIS' POV 
He starts to run his hands through his hair. He tries to straighten up the mess on his head. He picks up some gel and squirts a small amount in his hand. 
He runs it through his hair, getting the desired look. 
LOUIS (to himself) You are a handsome devil. 
LOUIS APARTMENT 
Louis spins around and grabs his keys off of the coffee table. He then dances right out the door. 
INT. QUINN'S ROOM-A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
Louis walks into Quinn's room and finds him not there. 
LOUIS (puzzled) Weird? 
Louis walks out into... 
HALLWAY 
...the hallway. Ryan Blood is standing in the doorway of his room, across the hall. 
RYAN BLOOD You looking for Quinn? 
Takes Louis' a second to register Ryan's question. 
LOUIS Yes? 
RYAN BLOOD (nodding toward the exit door) He just left. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING 
Louis runs outside. He looks up and down the street. In the distance he finally spots them, Quinn and Zoey holding hands. 
LOUIS (to himself) What do we have here? 
EXT. CAFE-MOMENTS LATER 
Louis stands across the street, staring right into the window of the cafe. He clearly sees Quinn and Zoey on a date. 
His eyes widen as their hands touch. 
EXT. ZOEY'S APARTMENT BUILDING-LATER 
Zoey and Quinn walk holding hands through the apartment building parking lot. Zoey stops for a second and turns to face Quinn. 
ZOEY Why haven't I seen your place? 
QUINN My place isn't very exciting. 
Ryan leans back in his desk chair. Louis has cleared off a spot on a messy couch. 
The apartment, simply put, is a "shithole" 
RYAN BLOOD You're here to learn more about his "coming and goings". To find out what I have seen. 
LOUIS So far you are dead on. 
RYAN BLOOD It's more than that Louis- 
LOUIS -You know who I am? RYAN BLOOD I know pretty much everything. I've watched you, studied you...I feel I'm expert on your little game every seventy years. 
LOUIS Really? 
RYAN BLOOD Oh yes. 
Ryan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers one at a time at Louis. 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) You battled as mortals- (beat) (MORE) 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) -You were a Lamanite then- (beat) -Quinn was a commander of the Nephites, last survivor of that nation- (beat) -The savoir spoke to him, showed him his future...his destiny- (beat) -See after the death of Christ there was some debate on what was going to bring on the end and signal his return- (beat) - It was decided two great warriors had to fight. The winner would determine the start of the apocalypse. Your boss of course needed someone to represent his interests. Who better than Quinn's old adversary? 
Louis brushes the pile of papers of his lap. 
LOUIS Where are you going with this you weird little man? 
RYAN BLOOD You had strategy in the beginning. Middle Ages...Old West...Even World War II. (beat) Let's take a step back for a second. The Old West. Lack of faith, corruption, these things make Quinn weak. The chink in his armor is his faith in people. You knew that, and corrupting America...a young land...was the key. (beat) Quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked for a human ally. That ally was Joseph Smith, and Quinn...or I mean Moroni...led Joseph to the plates that later when into- 
Ryan picks a book up and throws it at Louis. Louis looks down at the "Book Of Mormon". 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) -His little plan didn't work, but the book is a great coffee table discussion piece. This made him weak Louis. You could have destroyed him. The problem is you've allowed yourself to become fond of him. YOU need to embrace your destiny. 
LOUIS How do I do that? 
RYAN BLOOD This girl is distracting him. Get his mind focused on the matter at hand. At this point I'm afraid he isn't even going to fight you. 
LOUIS I'm surprised this girl even likes Quinn. He comes across creepy. 
RYAN BLOOD Maybe that's the key- 
LOUIS (lightbulb) -Make her think he's crazy. 
INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER 
Quinn opens the door to his room and spies a silhouette in the far corner. 
LOUIS Where have you been? 
The silhouette comes out of the darkness and into view. It should come to no surprise that Louis is emerging from the darkness. 
QUINN You've been waiting long? 
LOUIS No I figured you were on your way back- QUINN -because you are spying on me again? So I don't need to tell you where I've been. 
JACK (O.S.) What the fuck?!? I want to watch Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia in peace! 
QUINN I need to see Zoey. 
ANNA What about tomorrow? Or never is good. 
You hear Zoey off screen. ZOEY (O.S.) What's going on?? 
Zoey comes to the doorway and stands behind Anna. 
ZOEY (CONT'D) Quinn? What's wrong? 
QUINN I need to talk to you, it's important. 
Quinn grabs her by the arm and pulls her outside, pushing her right past Anna. 
ANNA Jesus Christ! 
Anna slams the door shut, leaving Zoey and Quinn outside. 
QUINN I need to tell you everything. Anna is so right. 
ZOEY What are you talking about? Anna is right? 
QUINN I've not been honest with you about what I do...or who I am. 
ZOEY OK? 
QUINN I need to come clean. I want you to trust me. I want your friends to trust me. 
ZOEY (nervous laugh) OK Quinn, just spit it out. 
QUINN OK (beat) I'm an archangel named Moroni and I basically represent "light" or everything that's good. Louis, my friend, represents "darkness". Every seventy years we have to fight to the death. If I win everything stays the way it is. The world continues turning. If I lose, Louis takes on the role of the Antichrist and the apocalypse will be unleashed. I'm talking Book of Revelations stuff here. So I only have a limited time left in this world... (beat) I want to spend that time with you. 
Zoey is stunned, silent. 
ZOEY Oh honey... 
Zoey touches his face. 
ZOEY (CONT'D) You must have a brain tumor or something. You're obviously mentally ill. 
QUINN Zoey? I... 
Zoey puts her finger up to his lips to quiet him. 
ZOEY Shhh. You need me more than ever. 
Zoey reaches down and takes a confused Quinn's hand. She leads him to the door. Like a sheep herder, she takes Quinn inside of the apartment. 
The last image we see is the apartment door slamming behind them. 
CUT TO: 
ZOEY I don't know. He's losing it. 
Jack hands her the folder. 
JACK You need to look at this. 
Zoey takes the folder from him and starts reading. 
JACK (CONT'D) I spent a lot of time gathering that information. 
ZOEY So what is all this? 
JACK Quinn Wilson and Louis Marks were orphans. 
Zoey is flipping through documents. 
JACK (CONT'D) Quinn displayed some erratic behavior from the beginning. One of the staff members was Mormon and they would read stories to Quinn out of the Book Of Mormon. That employee was later fired, but a seed was planted in Quinn's head. He kept going on about how he and Louis were meant to fight to the death. Some of the children at the time claim Louis would encourage this behavior. He probably thought this was Quinn's attempt at playing. (beat) As things continued the staff at the orphanage thought Quinn needed help beyond what they could offer. They sent Quinn to a hospital. 
Zoey puts the folder down, the documents fall to the floor. 
ZOEY You're not telling me anything I didn't already know. 
ANNA That makes it worse. You're going to continue this now that you know for a fact that he is nuts? 
ZOEY I'm too far into this now. I don't have a choice. 
Zoey picks the documents up and places them in the folder. She then tosses the folder on the coffee table. 
JACK Why don't you let us save you? Please Zoey. 
ZOEY Let me be guys. 
Zoey walks to her bedroom, leaving Anna and Jack exhausted. 
ZOEY AND ANNA'S APARTMENT-EARLY MORNING 
The apartment is quiet. Anna no where in sight, more than likely in her room sleeping. 
Jack is passed out on the couch. Zoey walks in, it's obvious she hasn't slept all night. 
She scoots Jack's legs over and sits on the couch. She proceeds to pick up the file folder. 
She starts thumbing through the documents. After a few moments she finds one of interest. 
She reaches over and pushes Jack. 
JACK (rousing up) Ehhh...what? You better be a hot bear of a man. 
Jack looks up and sees Zoey. 
JACK (CONT'D) Or Zoey...What do you need hun? 
Zoey hands Jack a document from the folder. 
LOUIS And a battle cry is going to give me the advantage in battle? 
RYAN BLOOD Of course it will. Why don't you try one out? 
LOUIS What? 
RYAN BLOOD Yeah, try one out right now. It's liberating. 
LOUIS I'd rather not. 
RYAN BLOOD Come on. 
LOUIS (extremely confused) Right here? 
RYAN BLOOD Here I'll go first- 
Ryan let's out a scream that sounds as though he is being sodomized. 
LOUIS That was...interesting. 
RYAN BLOOD See? (beat) Your turn. 
Louis looks around. 
LOUIS So right now? 
RYAN BLOOD Of course. 
Louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream. It comes out more like frightened little girl. 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) Oh come on! That sounds like you are scared of the battle. What? Are you scared of Quinn? You probably are- 
Louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly better. 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) That's good! Come on! 
Louis lets out another one that actually causes Ryan to jump back. 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) Yes that's what I'm talking about! 
Out of nowhere, Quinn walks up to the two of them. 
RYAN BLOOD (CONT'D) (noticing Quinn) Quinn?!? Good to see you! 
Quinn grabs Louis' arm. 
QUINN We need to talk. 
LOUIS (to Ryan) Excuse me for a second. 
Louis walks with Quinn to a spot that gives them some distance away from Ryan. 
QUINN I know that guy and I don't trust him. 
JACK I got a text about thirty minutes ago. I'm pretty sure she is going to head to Quinn's apartment. 
ANNA Jack... JACK What? 
ANNA Her Christ Complex is going to get her killed. 
JACK Trust me I know Anna. (beat) I know... 
KNOCKING is heard at the door. Anna gets up to answer. 
JACK (CONT'D) Maybe it's Quinn the jackass. 
Anna just gets the door opened a crack when... 
Ryan and Louis BURST into the room. Anna SCREAMS. Louis restrains her against a wall. 
Jack gets up from the couch, but he meets a gun handle to the head from Ryan. 
RYAN BLOOD Good afternoon boys and girls! I need your assistance. 
INT. QUINN'S ROOM-MOMENTS LATER 
Quinn walks into his room. To his surprise, Zoey is sitting on his bed. It appears she has been there for a while. 
QUINN How do people keep ending up in my room? 
ZOEY (laughs) You need to learn to lock up. 
Quinn walks over and sits on the bed beside her. 
QUINN I'm not fighting Louis. 
ZOEY Why the change of heart? 
QUINN I think you might be right. I don't think it's necessary. I think the world will keep turning one way or another. I'm not dependant on that. (beat) I'm not a savior. 
ZOEY Do you really believe? You know? 
QUINN Yes. I do believe it. I know it actually. Since I have been with you, I've doubted what I know to be fact though. Then it hit me, it really doesn't matter. 
ZOEY I'll help you Quinn. I don't want to do it for myself... (MORE) 
ZOEY (CONT'D) I don't want to do it because I feel I have to. Obligations, or dark incidents from my past...That's not a reason to help anyone. It makes me fucking selfish actually. 
QUINN You're not selfish Zoey. 
ZOEY I care about you Quinn. That's sincerely my reason for wanting to do this. That's a first for me you know? 
QUINN I know... 
Quinn hugs her and they slowly lay down on the bed together. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
JACK Ass fuck salad- 
Quinn puts the duct tape back on Jack's mouth. Even though we can't make out what he is saying, he is still running off at the mouth. 
QUINN That actually felt kind of good. 
Quinn pats Jack on the head. 
QUINN (CONT'D) I'll be back guys. 
Quinn leaves the room. Muffled cursing can be heard through out the apartment. 
CLOSE SHOT-QUINN'S BED 
A long black box is pulled out from under Quinn's bed. We see Quinn's hands unlatch and then open it. 
Inside we see Quinn's katana. His hand grips the hilt. 
INT. QUINN'S ROOM 
Quinn gets up, holding his katana and ready for a fight. He's dressed in a black biker jacket, kind of looking like the Bride from Kill Bill. 
He walks to the doorway. He stands still for a second. He's preparing his next move. 
Bad ass comic book pose...'nuff said. CUT TO: 
TITLE CARD: DAY ZERO THE ENDGAME 
DREAM SEQUENCE 
START CHOIR MUSIC 
INT. CHURCH 
The front doors to the church swing open. Light fills the sanctuary. Zoey walks through the doors. 
She heads toward the alter and sees a man, in his 50's, kneeling. It appears he might be praying. 
She places her hand on his shoulder. As he turns around she sees her Dad. 
ZOEY I'm not doing it anymore. You will not have redemption from me. 
DAD (raspy) Zoey... 
He reaches for her, she pulls away. She starts to back up. 
ZOEY Take ownership of what you did. Don't rely on me to save you. I need to start saving myself. 
She slowly backs up and then turns to walk away. 
ZOEY (CONT'D) (as she is turning) Goodbye. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
Louis is irritated. 
LOUIS Will you shut up?!? You are ruining my climatic fight. 
Louis spies Quinn in the distance. 
LOUIS (CONT'D) Showtime. 
START CHOIR MUSIC 
Quinn lowers his katana, it brushes against the blades of grass. Louis follows suit as he slowly walks to meet Quinn in the middle. 
The two warriors stand on opposite sides of the battle field. 
END CHOIR MUSIC 
Quinn looks over and sees Zoey. 
QUINN Let her go! 
Ryan grabs her tighter. 
RYAN BLOOD Not yet... 
QUINN (To Louis) Is this the game you want to play? 
LOUIS I'm not going to lose this time. 
ZOEY (To Quinn) I thought you didn't believe this shit anymore. 
QUINN There's more going on than you realize Zoey. 
ZOEY This is fucked. Quinn you're not 5000 years old. You were born in an orphanage. None of this makes sense. 
LOUIS Lady, it would look weird if we roamed the earth for 5000 years without facing a mortal death! We keep getting reborn, sometimes we even switch physical form. Thanks for coming to the game late missy! 
ZOEY That makes total fucking sense. Color me stupid! 
QUINN (to Louis) You don't get it do you. LOUIS What?!? 
QUINN If you win...you're not becoming the antichrist. 
LOUIS What are you talking about?? 
QUINN It's   Ryan...it's always been Ryan. 
LOUIS (To Ryan) What is he talking about? 
RYAN BLOOD He's pitting us against each other. 
QUINN I'm going to be honest with you Louis. I've always been honest. 
LOUIS Yeah sometimes to a fault. 
Quinn turns toward Louis. He pulls his katana up to attack position and Louis follows suit. 
ZOEY (tearing up) Wow...yeah goodbye. 
Quinn and Louis charge each other. Zoey doesn't bother to stay to watch the battle. She slowly walks away. 
Quinn and Louis' swords meet. The clang is triumphant. Details of this climatic battle will be choreographed by the actors involved, but think high flying Shaw Brothers film. 
We don't see a clear victor, just the two boys going at it until we can't tell who is who. 
OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD-AWAY FROM THE BATTLE 
Zoey starts to make a call on her cell phone. 
CLOSE SHOT-CELL PHONE 
She starts to dial 911. Her thumb moves in the position to hit send. 
OTHER SIDE OF THE FIELD 
Zoey stops. She slowly puts her phone away. She looks back toward where the battle is going on. 
She starts to walk back. The walk turns into a jog. Finally the jog turns into a full run. 
OPEN FIELD 
When she gets to the field Quinn and Louis are gone. All that can be seen is Ryan Blood's body, two katanas and an empty ninja suit. Zoey leans down and touches Quinn's katana. 
ZOEY (laughs to herself) I am Curious:Yellow (beat) Goodbye boys... 
Zoey stares out into the open field. She feels reborn. She knows there is a new world, a new perspective for her beyond the horizon.

TITLE CARD: 70 YEARS LATER 
INT. UNIVERSITY CONFERANCE HALL 
The camera slowly pans toward an older ninety year old Zoey. She's behind a podium, there is a sign on the front that reads: Marshal University Association of Free Thought. 
ZOEY For years we have thought absence of the impossible indicated that we were exercising free thought. In my experience ladies and gentleman, that's not the case. (beat) Believing in hope my friends, opening yourself up to accepting there might be more than the world around you. That's truly being a free thinker. 
The camera ends with a close shot on Zoey's face. 
EXT. PARK-RIVERSIDE-LATER 
Zoey sits on the same bench where she met Quinn. Her great-granddaughter, JENNIFER walks up. She sits down beside her grandmother. 
JENNIFER Hey Grandma. 
ZOEY Hey...

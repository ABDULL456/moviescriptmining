Second draft script 
With the support of the Media Programme of the European Union The SOUND of Muay Thai boxing... The Art of Eight Limbs... Thrust and move... Feet shuffling across the ring... 
FADE IN: 
INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON a pair of hands from VARIOUS ANGLES... The SOUNDS of the fighting grow LOUDER. Punches, kicks, elbows... The hands tense into fists. They're strong hands. Fighter's hands. 
ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL Julian (mid-thirties) staring at his hands. 
Even though he's kept in shape, he hasn't fought for a long time. The SOUND of the boxing match gets LOUDER STILL as Julian continues staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating. Suddenly he breaths in. 
Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this is Liang, barely sixteen. He looks nervous, occasionally glancing at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the far wall. 
Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a tight fist. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CORRIDORS - NIGHT 
The SOUNDS of the boxing match reach FEVER PITCH as we TRACK WITH Julian and Liang making their way towards the ring. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT 
Two Young Thai Boxers beat the crap out of each other. The crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which way the fight will turn. 
One of the Thai Boxers goes down and money immediately starts changing hands... 
The ring is cleared and Liang jumps in as Julian pushes his way though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes. They know him here. 
Again bets are placed.... 
PICK OUT a face in the crowd. Billy. Julian's older brother (late thirties). 
Julian sits down next to Billy who's delighted to see him, throwing his arm around him, pulling him in close. 
BILLY ... I love violence! 
Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey. Julian refuses. He's more interested in the fight. 
BACK TO THE RING where the fight has just started. Liang is immediately on the ropes. 
Julian watches, concerned. 
Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. He nods to Julian and takes it outside. 
BACK TO THE FIGHT where Liang pulls an amazing move. Turns the tables. Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings and backfists. 
As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the auditorium. 
Liang wins the fight with a knock out... The crowd go wild with adulation... 
Julian watches, transfixed... 
Liang is lit up by a beatific white light... As he stands triumphant in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him... Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him... 
THE LIZARD Wouldn't listen... Julian stares at him... 
JULIAN Well maybe you didn't try hard enough. The Lizard takes the handkerchief away from his nose. Shows the bloodstain to Julian. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) When was the last time you slept? The Lizard smiles but stares at Julian with hatred in his eyes. 
THE LIZARD Just cause I ain't slept for three days, don't mean I don't know right from wrong... and your brother has become a real problem... Again Julian stares at him - clenching his fist. The Lizard notices this but gazes up into Julian's face blankly. 
THE LIZARD (CONT'D) You're not going to cause another ruckus in my club now - are you? A long pause as Julian considers it. 
JULIAN No. 
THE LIZARD Good - 'cause Billy ripped me off and then he broke my face... Julian turns to Gordon. 
GORDON Like I always said. One day he's going to meet the devil. Beat. 
JULIAN You know where he is now? The Lizard stares at Julian. 
THE LIZARD Bangkok has millions of people my friend. You and your brother, you're lost to my world... The Lizard gets up - puts out his cigarette and looks at Julian... 
THE LIZARD (CONT'D) So what you going to do? You wanna come in? Very good amphetamine in here... Julian looks over to Gordon. Sees he's keen. 
JULIAN You go. I'm gonna look around. See if I can find him. 
GORDON Sure--? 
JULIAN Go on. He turns back to The Lizard. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) Which way'd he go? The Lizard nods his head towards the busy street. Julian turns and heads off... Gordon steps up to the entrance to the club. The Lizard sticks out an arm, blocking his way. 
THE LIZARD His brother didn't pay. 
GORDON So? That's his problem. 
THE LIZARD Now it's your problem. 
GORDON I'm with you mate. Billy's fucked-- 
THE LIZARD You don't pay his debt - you don't enter. Gordon thinks for beat. Takes out his money... 
GORDON How much...? ...and The Lizard smiles for the first time. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MA LONG'S BROTHEL - NIGHT 
Julian is talking to Ma Long, fifties, the mother figure to a group of girls who stand in the background. 
JULIAN You seen Billy? 
MA LONG Not this evening. A particularly pretty prostitute catches Juilan's eye. He stares at her, stone faced. 
JULIAN Well if he comes in, tell him I'm looking for him, yeah? 
MA LONG He's not coming in. I tell him to stay away. He hurt one of my girls Julian. Not good... Julian considers. Pulls out his wad of notes again. Hands a few to Ma Long. 
JULIAN Yeah, well... if you see him, tell him I'm looking for him... Ma Long nods as she takes the money. Julian is about to leave. He looks at the pretty prostitute again. Stares at her for a moment. Then walks out. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - NIGHT 
Billy's so wasted he's bumping into people. He starts window shopping the various brothels that line the street: groups of girls smiling at him... Anything for a price... PICK OUT one particularly young-looking girl. Just fifteen. She makes eye contact with Billy... He smiles... Pulls out a roll of notes... 
CUT TO: 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Is this your daughter? Beat. 
CHOI YAN LEE 
(IN THAI) Yes. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) How could you? ... but Choi Yan Lee just stares at his daughter. Finally: 
CHOI YAN LEE 
(IN THAI) ... What? 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) How could you let this happen? 
CHOI YAN LEE 
(IN THAI) I didn't do anything. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Well now's your chance. A long moment between them as Choi Yan Lee fails to understand what Chang is suggesting. Chang stands back. 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) Do what thou will. Choi Yan Lee nods. Chang leaves the room, closing the door behind him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROOM 611 - NIGHT 
Chang sits drinking tea in silence with Lieutenant Kim. The guards in the corridor stare at the closed door of Room 610 from where we hear the cries of Billy being beaten to death. ANGLE ON: Daeng who's starting to look scared. Phaiban puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder. As the beating reaches its climax, with Choi Yan Lee screaming out Thai obscenities, we hear the sickening sound of Billy's neck snapping. And then a regular thud as blow after blow rain down on his body. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROOM 610 - NIGHT 
Chang opens the door and looks through. Choi Yan Lee is sitting breathlessly on the floor covered in blood. In his hand he holds a piece of wood he has ripped from a chair. Billy lies dead, his head completely smashed in. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT 
A police car drives through the city streets and onto the freeway heading out of town. 
CUT TO: 
INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT 
The bloodied Choi Yan Lee sits in the back, Chang on one side, Kim on the other. As the police car turns onto a more major road, Choi Yan Lee starts to get nervous. 
CHOI YAN LEE 
(IN THAI) You missed my turning. I live that way. Beat. Chang says nothing. Phaiban is driving, Daeng in the passenger seat. Daeng looks back at them through the rearview mirror... 
KIM 
(IN THAI) We'll get you there. 
CUT TO: 
(IN THAI) I won't forget. I promise. Forgive me. Chang approaches with the axe. He stops for a moment. Looks down at him... 
CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) I'll change. I'll be a better man. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) I know. Chang slams down the axe, severing Choi Yan Lee's arm at the elbow. Choi Yan Lee SCREAMS in agony. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
The anonymity of a hotel room. Julian opens the curtains and we see the sky line of Bangkok - he looks out. He lies back on the bed, surfing through two hundred TV channels. Settles on a boxing match. Starts drifting off... As he drifts we hear the SOUND OF SINGING. A karaoke rendition of 'I Hung My Head' by Johnny Cash. 
VOICE I set off running to wake from the dream My brother's rifle went into the sheen I kept on running Into the south lands That's where they found me My head in my hands 
CUT TO: 
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 
REVEAL that the voice is that of Chang and he's not half bad either: deeper than you'd have though, and with it comes a stage presence, a sort of John Wayne swagger... 
CHANG The sheriff he asked me Why I had run And then it came to me Just what I had done And all for no reason Just one piece of lead I hung my head I hung my head. The policemen, still dressed in their uniforms, watch in respectful silence. Daeng sits with them. He too watches in awe. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SKYTRAIN - DAWN 
Chang travels home across the city. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / LANDING - MORNING 
Chang opens the door as quietly as he can. He slips off his shoes and walks gingerly into the apartment. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - MORNING 
On the kitchen table Chang sees a picture. A badly-drawn house with a man, a woman and a child. Across the bottom: "LOVE YOU 
DADDY FROM DAUGHTER AND WIFE XXX' Chang stares at it and smiles - picks it up and pins it to the fridge with a magnet. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHANG'S HOUSE / KANITA'S BEDROOM - DAY 
Chang and Kanita, his eight year old daughter, are playing with her dolls who have captured a soft toy. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) So now that they've caught him... What are they going to do? Kanita thinks for a moment. 
KANITA 
(IN THAI) Put him in jail. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Come on. They haven't got a jail big enough. Look at the size of him. Again Kanita thinks. 
KANITA 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DUSK 
The remnants of various room service orders litter the floor along with the trappings of a heavy session: empty bottles of alcohol, drug paraphernalia, etc. Julian lies sleeping, entwined in the limbs of the girl... There is a knock on the door. Julian and the girl ignore it. A pause and then Julian's mobile phone starts ringing. He doesn't answer. The knocking starts up again, this time louder. Finally: 
JULIAN Julian's not here mate. Fuck off... Beat - then we hear a voice from behind the door. 
GORDON (O.S.) Julian? Still they ignore him. Either too wasted or too tired to do anything else. 
GORDON (O.S.) (CONT'D) Julian...? I need to talk with you... Beat. Finally Julian answers with zero energy... 
JULIAN What is it? 
GORDON (O.S.) It's about Billy... 
JULIAN I can't deal with my brother right now... Beat. 
GORDON (O.S.) He's dead... Julian opens his eyes, confused - still out of his head on drugs. 
JULIAN What? No answer. Finally Julian gets up and wraps a towel around his body and slowly opens the door. Gordon stands in the hallway - behind him two Thai men from Julian's crew. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) What happened? 
GORDON They found his body in a hotel room... Julian doesn't know what to say... Neither does Gordon. 
GORDON (CONT'D) Look, get dressed and I'll see you downstairs. Julian nods and closes the door. He stands still - glances out the window - seeing the sun setting and the night coming in. He glances at the pretty girl still sleeping on the bed. He goes into the bathroom where Mai is dressed and putting on make up. 
MAI What happened? Julian looks at her. 
JULIAN Someone killed Billy... The camera ZOOMS IN on Mai. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
A Mortuary Attendant pulls a sheet back to reveal - Billy. His body completely mutilated. Julian stares at his brother's corpse intensely, not betraying any emotion. He turns to Gordon who's standing behind him. 
GORDON What do we do? 
JULIAN For now... We wait. Julian glances back at the body... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT 
Julian stares up at the night sky, his mobile phone gripped tightly in his hand. He puts the phone down. He looks out across the city again then back to the phone. It's like he's scared. He picks it up quickly and dials. A moment as it rings then it's answered. 
JULIAN Hello Mum. Beat. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) It's me... Julian... Something's happened. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL - DAY 
The CAMERA tracks as we follow a pair of high heeled shoes belonging to an elegant woman in her fifties, who looks like she's in her forties and could actually pass for late thirties. She strides towards reception, a Porter struggling to keep up with her. This is Jenna Hopkins. Head of a notorious London Crime Family. Mother of both Julian and Billy. Newly appointed Lady Macbeth of Bangkok. She hands her passport over to the Concierge. 
JENNA I'd like to check in now please. The Concierge checks the computer. 
CONCIERGE I'm afraid the room won't be ready until four o'clock. Beat... Jenna just stares at him... 
CONCIERGE (CONT'D) ... It's policy 
JENNA I'd like to speak to your manager. Beat. 
CONCIERGE Yes of course... The Concierge retreats. Jenna lights a cigarette. 
CHARLIE LING He says he killed his daughter. Julian considers him for a moment. Slowly he pulls out a gun... Aims it at Choi Yan Lee's face... 
CHOI YAN LEE 
(IN THAI) Oh God. Please don't kill me. Please. I'll give you anything. Anything you want. My daughters. My shop. Please. I've paid for what I did. Look at me. In his desperation Choi Yan Lee suddenly lurches forward, brandishing his wounded arm at Julian. He pulls the bandages off, exposing the bloody stump. 
CHOI YAN LEE (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) I've paid for what I did. Don't you see? Julian turns to Charlie Ling. 
JULIAN What's he saying? Beat. 
CHARLIE LING He says... He says he's paid for what he's done. That he's been punished already. Choi Yan Lee nods his head enthusiastically. 
CHOI YAN LEE 
(IN THAI) He told me to do it. Then he took my hand. Look. Again he thrusts his stump at Julian who glances at him. 
JULIAN Who did that to him? Choi Yan Lee looks at the various faces that surround him - then stares directly at Julian. 
CHOI YAN LEE 
(IN THAI) The Angel of Vengeance... Charlie Ling looks at him surprised... yet there's a sense that deep down he knows what he's talking about... 
CHARLIE LING 
(IN THAI) It's a lie - he doesn't exist... 
CHOI YAN LEE 
(IN THAI) I'm telling the truth. It was the Angel of Vengeance. 
JULIAN What's he saying? 
CHARLIE LING He's lying... 
JULIAN Tell me. 
CHARLIE LING It's a story old women tell their grand children... 'The Angel of Vengeance' is supposed to come down from the heavens and judge the living... restore karma to the world.. Gordon laughs... but Julian listens with great interest... 
JULIAN How does he do that? 
CHARLIE LING Leads people to their destiny... That's the myth anyway. Ko Sam smiles. Julian doesn't. Finally: 
JULIAN Ask him who cut his hand off. Charlie Ling's reluctant to question him further. Julian insists. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) Do it. 
CHARLIE LING 
(IN THAI) Who turned you into a cripple - and no bullshit this time. Choi Yan Lee continues babbling hysterically... 
CHOI YAN LEE 
(IN THAI, QUIETLY) I'm telling you the truth... The Angel of Vengeance is real... He made me do it... You've got to believe me... I've already been judged. 
CHARLIE LING He says it was The Angel of Vengeance... Choi Yan Lee starts to giggle uncontrollably. 
CHOI YAN LEE 
(IN THAI) The Angel of Vengeance. Yes. You don't find the Angel of Vengeance. No. He finds you. 
JULIAN What's he saying? 
CHARLIE LING 
JULIAN ...it - or he - restores karma and order in the world. 
JENNA 'Restores' things? Who said anything about 'restoring' things? Beat. 
JULIAN He loves all humans... 
JENNA I don't know what kind of spiritual journey you're on, but you will kill 
HIM-- 
JULIAN I'm not, I'm just... Julian can't get the words out. He gets up. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) ... I've got to go. ...and Julian leaves - letting the door to the office stay open. We pick up the sounds of the fighters training outside as we slowly ZOOM IN on Jenna. She turns to Gordon. 
JENNA How's business? 
GORDON It's alright, yeah. Well, what with Billy not being around, it's tricky to be honest... 
JENNA What d'you mean? 
GORDON Well, we're supposed to be moving five keys out the end of this week. But Billy's not here, is he? 
JENNA I'm here. Julian's here. Gordon shrugs. Jenna clocks it. 
JENNA (CONT'D) What's gotten into him...? Is he high or something? 
GORDON I don't know. Earlier today - we had the guy... The guy that killed Billy. Had a gun against his face. But then - nothing... 
JENNA Nothing? 
GORDON Julian let him go. Now there's all this stuff about angels... I don't know what the fuck's wrong with him. 
JENNA Not like you... Gordon smiles at her uncertainly. 
GORDON I know how to do what needs to be done. That's all. She stares at him, long enough to make him uncomfortable. 
JENNA So tell me... What did he mean when he said it was complicated? 
GORDON There's this other guy... Might have been involved... 
JENNA So we kill them both. 
GORDON We don't know who the other guy is yet... 
JENNA Okay. Well how about we start with the guy we do know? 
CUT TO: 
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 
A girl sings 'Another Woman's Man' by Dolly Parton. Julian's sitting alone at a table, nursing a drink. Mai enters, looking much more sophisticated than when we saw her in the hotel. She sits next to Julian and gives him a kiss on the cheek. 
MAI Sorry I'm late. 
JULIAN It's alright... He drinks his drink. Silence... 
MAI What's wrong? 
JULIAN Nothing. Mai looks around the bar... It's half empty - some girls and men spread out. The waitress comes over and Mai orders a drink. They sit in silence, listening to the song... 
MAI See anyone you want us to take home tonight? Julian glances round but shakes his head. Looks at Mai. 
MAI (CONT'D) What? 
JULIAN Nothing... 
NADEE What is it? Chang takes her in his arms. He starts kissing her neck. 
CHANG I need to speak to you in Thai. A pause. 
NADEE 
(IN THAI) What is it? 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) I love you. She stares at him for a long moment. It's odd for him to have confessed his feelings in such a way. Not bad, just odd. And then she starts to kiss him back... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - EVENING 
Julian is anxiously waiting outside. He looks up as Mai comes out of her appartment in a red dress. Julian's face drops. 
MAI What is it? 
JULIAN You can't wear that. 
MAI Why not? 
JULIAN My mother's... Very particular about colours. 
MAI You're kidding? 
JULIAN She hates red. Come on, we'll get you something else. Mai stares at him, reluctant to give in. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) Come on. 
MAI This is insane. 
JULIAN Look, I'm telling you. It's easier this way. Trust me. Mai gives in. Takes his hand. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CLOTHES SHOP - NIGHT 
Chang picks out a dress for Mai. She takes it, finding it hard to believe that he's making her do this... 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Three people sit around a table awkwardly. Julian, Jenna and Mai (dressed very conservatively) all eating soup. A long silence. 
JENNA So... May, isn't it? 
JULIAN It's Mai, Mum. 
JENNA How long have you two known each other then? Mai's about to answer but Juilan gets there first. 
JULIAN A year and a half isn't it? Beat as Mai quickly counts in her head... 
MAI ...that sounds about right. 
JENNA Well it's always a rare treat to meet one of Julian's lady friends. 
JULIAN Mum, please... 
JENNA So, where did you two meet? 
JULIAN I saw her walking down the street. Jenna raises an eyebrow... 
JENNA You're right. We're family. We stick together. But Billy was family too. 
JULIAN Billy was a fuck up... He deserved everything he got. You know it and I know it. 
JENNA That's it. I'm not listening to this. I don't ever want to hear you mention his name again... Do you hear me? 
JULIAN Yeah we were brothers, but we were never close... And he was only in Bangkok cause you couldn't control him. So you sent him to me-- 
JULIAN (CONT'D) -- So you sent him to me and what could I do? 
JENNA You could have protected him. 
JULIAN I did what I could. And that's more than you ever did. 
JENNA I would've done anything for him. Okay, he wasn't born with as many advantages as you were. He struggled with things. But I always stood by him. 
JULIAN And what did that get him? I'll tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me. 
JENNA Don't you dare blame me for what happened back then. 
JULIAN I'm only here 'cause of you. If you didn't exist, I wouldn't be here. Beat. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) I could've been someone, Mum. I was on my way... Jenna stares at him - this is a conversation she does not like having... 
JENNA You would've been a great fighter... You could've gone pro. 
JULIAN Don't you think I know that? And look at me now. I'm a front for a drugs smuggling. He turns to Mai. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) It's true... The whole thing's a front. Every day I see kids coming in with great potential. And every day I see kilos of heroin going out. And it's all because of you, Ma. You and the money and the drugs. Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up. He quietens down... 
JENNA At least you're not behind bars and that's more important to me. Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say this. 
JULIAN That's right Mum. That's what's more important to you. But what about me? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you... Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) ...that's right Mum. Think about it. With me gone you were safe. And it turned out to be good for business as well. All very convenient. Silence between them. Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands now shaking. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) Is that what happened with Billy? Did Billy become a problem like I did? Wouldn't surprise me, he was a big fucking problem when he was here... Still, at least you didn't have him killed. Jenna slaps him hard on the face. Julian recovers. Looks up at her. Very intense. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) I'm not going to kill him for you, Mum. Doesn't matter what you say. And do you want to know why? 
JENNA Surprise me. 
JULIAN 'Cause I'm going to fight him. In the ring. Me versus him. 
JENNA Well that seems sensible... And what do you hope that's going to achieve? 
JULIAN I don't expect you to understand. Cause you don't understand anything that isn't about you. 
JENNA And when you lose, what's going to happen then? 
JULIAN I don't know... But maybe this time I'll win. Like you say, only God forgives. Maybe this time he'll forgive me... Jenna turns to Mai. 
JENNA Do you understand what he's talking about? 'Cause I haven't got a fucking a clue. 
JULIAN You never did, Mum. A pause. Julian's touched a nerve. Jenna recovers. 
JENNA I hope you find what you're looking for. 'Cause if you don't, it's going to find you and I'm not always going to be there to look after you. Jenna composes herself. Suddenly brightens. A different person. 
JENNA (CONT'D) Nice to meet you Mai. Hope to see you again soon. Jenna shakes her hand. Mai's too shocked to resist. And then, as if nothing had happened, Jenna leaves. Julian covers his face with his napkin. 
MAI Are you alright? He's not. He's crying. But he doesn't want anyone to see. 
JULIAN I'm fine. Beat. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) I'll be fine. In a minute. Julian wipes his face clean. Pulls himself together. 
MAI It's fine, but you know... It's not my style. 
JULIAN What do you mean? 
MAI Maybe you should give it to your mother. 
JULIAN Don't to be so hard on her. Her life hasn't been easy. 
MAI Come on Julian. She's a fucking bitch. 
JULIAN Don't say that, okay? You don't know what you're talking about. She'd do anything for me. 
MAI The way she talks to you -- 
JULIAN Don't go there. 
MAI What? 'Don't talk about my mother'? Come on Julian. Julian stands up, angry. 
MAI (CONT'D) Why don't you fuck her instead of me? Julian grabs hold her neck. Throws her hard against the wall. 
JULIAN You don't get to judge her. You think she's bad? You should've met my dad. But he's not around anymore, and do you know why? Cause she loved me too much. He lets go of her neck. Mai rubs her neck. 
MAI You're fucked. He pulls money out of his pocket. 
JULIAN How much do I owe you? He forces a roll of notes into her hand, forcing her to take it. 
MAI Fuck you. She opens the door, sets fire to the money, and walks out of the room. As she walks down the hotel corridor, Julian slams his fists into the wall. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SKYLIGHT BAR - NIGHT 
A mixed clientele. High class. Asian and European. But there's an edge to the atmosphere. The music's that bit too loud, that bit too aggressive. And the people inside don't look like they're having a good time. It seems evil. Sleazy. Jenna introduces herself to Yuri Karkov, a well dressed and charismatic Russian in his forties who is surrounded by Thai girls and fellow Russians including his distinctive looking bodyguard, Dimitri. As the camera TRACKS CLOSER to them we start to hear what they're saying... 
YURI KARKOV ... so why do you want to kill a policeman? Policemen are good. They mind their own business and keep the streets safe. Stop people stealing my cars... 
JENNA You really want to know? 
YURI KARKOV Yes. It may effect the price. 
JENNA He killed my son. 
YURI KARKOV Revenge. Pricey... 
JENNA This is Bangkok. Nothing's that expensive. 
YURI KARKOV You're right. Most things are cheap in Bangkok. Especially life... We'll take care of this business for you. But it won't be easy and it won't be cheap. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Chang and his crew eat dinner together. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A crappy van pulls up outside. Out get three Cambodian men. Very poor, badly clothed. They look like farmers. Only they pull out semi automatic firearms and head for the restaurant. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Chang has just finished a meal with the Cops including Kim, Daeng and Phaiban. Chang is just settling the bill when the Three Gunmen walk in. He looks up just as they OPEN FIRE. An insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all the mirrors on the back wall, taking out Two Waitresses and covering the room with broken glass. Chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover. Chang's men are completely pinned down. Phaiban's been hit and his white shirt has turned dark red with blood. Chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair. In it, his pistol. The Gunmen keep firing. As soon as a clip is finished, they pull it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting. A stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair Chang's jacket's on. It falls to the ground. With it, his pistol. He grabs it and returns fire, letting off four rounds. He takes Gunman One. Head shot, right between the eyes. Gunman Two sees this and sprays at Chang - - but Chang manages to dive to cover. He rolls and fires again, shooting Gunman Two in the chest three times. Chang's out of ammo and needs to reload. Gunman Three's weapon jams. He drops his weapon and runs. Before he's finished reloading his pistol, Chang's after him. He sees Phaiban. Dead. Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood from his chest. Chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELECTRICAL SHOP - NIGHT 
Chang enters, followed by the others. Gunman Three is incredibly relieved to have found it. Li Po stands behind the counter - beside him sits Pan, a twelve year old boy who is severely handicapped. As soon as Li Po sees Chang and his crew arrive with Gunman Three next to them he knows the game's up. He can't run. His kid's sitting there... He approaches them with a heavy sigh. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) You know why we're here. 
LI PO 
(IN THAI) Yes... 
GUNMAN THREE 
(IN THAI) He set it up. He knows who ordered the hit. He'll tell you. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Don't talk unless I ask you to. Understood? 
GUNMAN THREE 
(IN THAI) Yes. Completely understood. Chang turns to Li Po. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Do you have anything to say for yourself? 
LI PO 
(IN THAI) I'm a salesman. Some of the things I sell aren't exactly legal... But I'll give you the man that hired the hit... Chang stares at him... 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Good... Li Po summons the contact details on his distinctive looking mobile phone. Proffers it to Chang. 
LI PO 
(IN THAI) As for myself, I'm not scared of paying for what I've done. I just... just don't hurt my son. Chang looks down at Pan - who is just staring at them, not understanding the situation. Chang takes the phone from Li Po. 
GUNMAN THREE 
(IN THAI) You see? He knows. He's got the details. I told you he would. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) And I told you not to talk unless I asked you. Chang aims his gun at Gunman Three. 
GUNMAN THREE 
(IN THAI) Wait. You said if I took you to him you'd let me live. Chang shakes his head. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) I never said that. Chang fires. Gunman Three's brains spatter across the TV screens on the far side of the wall. Pan begins to cry and Li Po hugs him and tells him how much he loves him... thinking they're next... Chang studies the mobile phone. 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) This him? Li Po nods - scared. 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) Where do I find him? 
DIMITRI I don't know... 
CHANG How did she know me? Dimitri shakes his head. He really doesn't know. 
DIMITRI She asked for you by name... 
CHANG And what's my name? 
DIMITRI 
CHANG-- Chang starts to circle him. Dimitri's terrified. Doesn't know what the fuck he's on about. Suddenly he's grabbed from behind by Phaiban. Chang smashes a beer bottle and walks up behind Dimitri... 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) I see the way you look at my people. The way you abuse them with your eyes. For this, I take your sight. He pushes the broken bottle into Dimitri's eyes. Gauges them out. Dimitri screams hysterically - calling out for his mother in Russian... 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) You live in my country, but you fail to learn our language. You don't even try. For this I take your tongue... Phaibun grabs Dimitri's head from behind. Chang presses down on his stomach with his knee and opens his mouth - grabs hold of his tongue and with a blade slowly cuts it off. ...Dimitri's screams become more like the howls of a dying animal... Chang looks at him and his men release Dimitri who stumbles around the room like a chicken without a head... 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) You had opportunities. You could have chosen other paths... But you wouldn't listen... For this I give you silence... Chang grabs Dimitri and pushes the knife into his ear. First one side, then the other. SOUND OUT. We can't hear Dimitri's screaming. We can't hear anything at all. Beat. MUSIC STARTS. Painful and beautiful, but also tacky... The opening bars to one of Dolly Parton's classics. Karaoke style. 
NADEE (V.O.) If I should stay, I would only be in your way. So I'll go, but I know I'll think of you every step of the way. And Chang with his crew just stare at the tortured Russian as he screams until his lungs are ready to burst.

INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 
Nadee and Chang on stage. Singing their hearts out.

INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / JENNA'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Gordon is sitting on a chair in Jenna's hotel room, a whiskey in his hand, the Bangkok skyline behind him. 
NADEE (V.O.) Bittersweet memories that is all I'm taking with me. So, goodbye. Please don't cry, Jenna walks in from the bedroom wearing her dressing gown and walks over to him - a commanding presence. He makes to get up but she pushes him down and then leans down and kisses him hard on the mouth. 
CHANG (V.O.) We both know that I'm not what you, you need. 
CUT TO:

Jenna and Gordon are still kissing as the guitar solo of the instrumental section kicks in... 
CUT TO: 
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT 
As Chang waits for the instrumental section to end, he starts to cry, letting the tears flow without embarrassment. Nadee puts her arm around him to comfort him. The rest of the crew start crying as well, Daeng in particular. 
NADEE I hope life treats you kind And I hope you have all you've dreamed of... And I wish you, joy and happiness. 
Chang speaks on the phone. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) They're going to come after me... Okay. Good. He ends the call. Stares at his reflection in the window. 
CUT TO:

CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - DAY 
It's still early - the sun is only just starting to rise over he city. Charlie Ling's driving, Ko Sam beside him. Julian's in the back street. His face is a mask, his eyes hidden by his sunglasses... next to him is a silver shining motorcycle helmet.

CHANG 
(IN THAI) Hello... 
VOICE 
(IN THAI) She is in her room... 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) You sure it's her? 
VOICE 
(IN THAI) Yes... 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Good... see you very soon. ...and Chang hangs up... The Angel of Vengeance getting ready to strike again.

Chang steps out of his apartment into the hallway where a uniformed policeman sits on guard reading a Manga comic. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) What's your name? 
LI HOM 
Nadee and Kanita come out of the elevator and Nadee quickly sees that police guard from before has been replaced by someone else (Ko Sam)... Ko Sam smiles... 
KO SAM 
(IN THAI) I'm the new guard. Please, go on in. Nadee looks at him suspiciously but enters the apartment with Kanita. Ko Sam pretends to go back to reading his Manga comic. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / JENNA'S ROOM - DAY 
Jenna sips tea from a China cup. She puts it back down on to her saucer. Kim is sitting opposite her. Chang stands in the background. 
JENNA I came here to collect my son's body. Now it's released, my business in Bangkok is completed. 
KIM When are you leaving? 
JENNA Tonight. 
KIM And your other son - is he going with you? 
JENNA I've had no real contact with Julian since he ran away. 
KIM You watched him fight. Jenna looks over to Chang. 
JENNA I watched him lose. And he deserved to. You were the better fighter. My only sadness is that Billy got caught up in what he's doing out here. And paid for it with his life. Kim and the rest of the crew take this in. 
JENNA (CONT'D) I'll never testify against my own flesh and blood, Officer Chang. But he's a killer. Chang senses something. Starts to become agitated. 
JENNA (CONT'D) ... It pains me to say it, but my own son is a killer. He killed a cop back in England ten years ago. He's been on the run ever since. I say son... But he hasn't been a son to me. Chang stares at the door to the bedroom. Feels the presence of someone the other side of the door. 
JENNA (CONT'D) Not for a long time. Not since he killed that cop back home... That was ten years ago. He's been running ever since. And he'll never stop until he's caught. Until you catch him. Chang starts to push the door open... Behind him Jenna stands up. Before Chang fully opens the door, his mobile phone rings. It sounds INCREDIBLY loud. He takes it out and looks at the display with a feeling of dread. He answers... 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) 
HELLO 
NADEE (V.O.) 
(IN THAI) It's me... Did you change the guard? 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT / KITCHEN - DAY

INT. FOUR SEASON'S HOTEL / JENNA'S ROOM - DAY 
Chang begins to panic. His eyes fall upon Jenna. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Get out of the apartment... 
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY 
Chang stops in his tracks. It's as if he can feel the shotgun blast in his heart. He knows what's just happened... He stands still. He closes his eyes as if he had only to wish to make it all go away... He opens them again to see... The street is completely deserted. Chang stands alone in the middle of a ghost town. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Julian takes off his helmet that's covered in blood, throws it onto the floor and walks toward the front door. 
CHARLIE LING Wait... Julian turns back. Charlie Ling nods towards Kanita's room. 
CHARLIE LING (CONT'D) The kid. Julian shakes his head. 
JULIAN No way. 
CHARLIE LING 
SHE SAID-- 
JULIAN Who said? Beat. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) My mother? Charlie Ling nods. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) What kind of a mother says that? 
CHARLIE LING If you've got a problem, talk to her. 
JULIAN No. We're not doing it. 
CHARLIE LING You don't have to. I will. Charlie Ling kicks open the door. Julian realises he can't let him do it. And as Charlie Ling sees Kanita... Julian shoots him in the back. Charlie Ling slumps to the floor. Julian approaches the doorway. He looks in. Sees Kanita sitting on her bed. She stares at Julian, Charlie Ling's dead body at his feet. They hold each other's gaze... and then Julian slowly bows his head and leaves... 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHANG'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Julian walks out of the apartment with the shotgun raised, expecting to shoot Ko Sam... But the hallway is empty... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DAY 
Julian stumbles out of the apartment, desperately catching his breath. He ends up leaning on a stall - similar to the one he knocked over outside Choi Yan Lee's kiosk. Candles and incense. Buddha's smiling back at him... Julian looks around him and again everything seems intense and incredibly vibrant... A group of school children, all of whom are Downs Syndrome, are crossing the road. Smiles plastered across their faces... Julian stares at them... Their presence seems to have a calming effect on him, as if they're giving him new energy to do what he's starting to realize he has to do next.

Lift music. Julian stands perfectly still in the lift as it goes up... Just like Chang did before... 
CUT TO: 
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Julian takes the top off a vodka bottle with his teeth. He pours the spirit over his wound. It stings like hell and Julian screams in agony. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BANGKOK STREETS - DUSK 
Julian walks out into the night, the neon glow turning the streets into a modern day Hades.... Although the wound isn't life threatening, Julian's face is pale from the loss of blood. He looks like a ghost. He sees two cops chatting on a street corner. They don't see him, they're not even looking for him, but they remind him. Chang. It's just a matter of time... Julian keeps walking. Wipes sweat from his face. Looking for a place to hide. A hole in the ground. Anything. Then suddenly it comes to him. A single idea. A possible way of escape... 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT 
A series of napkins are rolled and placed in a steadily growing pile. The work is being carried out by Mai who has a lowly position in a massive and sterile industrial kitchen. Not the sort of life she planed on having... A Co-Worker calls out to her... 
CO-WORKER 
(IN THAI) Mai. Some guy's out there asking for you. Mai finishes the last napkin and places it on the pile. She walks towards the exit, passing her Co-Worker... 
CO-WORKER (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) Don't forget it's supposed to be my break next. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Mai comes from round a corner and sees Julian leaning against the wall. She checks that they're alone, knowing instinctively that he's in trouble. 
MAI What happened to you? Beat. Julian almost smiles. 
JULIAN I've got to get out of Bangkok. Didn't want to leave... He winces. 
JULIAN (CONT'D) ... without saying goodbye. 
MAI Who did this to you? A pause. 
JULIAN My mother... She made me what I am. And now I've got nothing. And they're after me. Mai stares at him. 
MAI Come with me... Julian looks at her. 
MAI (CONT'D) ...to Cambodia - we can hide there... You'll be safe there. Mai and Julian smile at each other. It's sweet. Innocent. 
JULIAN I got about twelve grand at the club... Should be enough to get us there. Set ourselves up. Disappear... 
MAI Now? 
JULIAN Right now. Mai looks around - they're alone. 
MAI Wait outside... 
CUT TO: 
INT. / EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Julian watches as Mai comes into the Restaurant from the kitchen and walks over to the bar area... Making sure no one's watching, Mai starts to pull money out of the til... Julian looks over at the shop front next to him... A Travel Agency. Pictures of holidays and beaches. Paradise. It all seems in his grasp. Mai comes up to him... 
MAI Let's go. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TAXI - NIGHT 
Mai and Julian are in the Taxi. He puts his arm around her. They're on their way... 
CUT TO: 
Chang leads Juilan across the field. The Cops follow a few steps behind with Mai. Suddenly, and completely unexpectedly, Chang punches Julian in the gut... Julian falls to the floor and Chang starts to viciously attack him, punching and kicking him. Finally Julian, unable to defend himself, is lying on the ground, immobile. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Get up. Julian rolls over. Eyes Chang. Slowly he starts to get up onto his knees. They continue, Chang forcing Julian to crawl as they make their way further into the field. Then Chang stops... 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) Get up. Now. Julian struggles to get up to his feet, but before he does, Chang kicks him hard in the chest, sending him back down to the floor. 
JULIAN I'm sorry... 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Do you have anything to say? 
JULIAN Don't hurt her. He kicks him in the stomach. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Do you have anything to say? 
JULIAN I'm sorry... Chang kicks him again - like you would kick a dog... Juilan groans. Chang squats down next to him. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) What do you expect me to do? 
JULIAN I don't know... I'm sorry. Chang gets up and walks on. He stops and turns round. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) Come on. Julian stumbles to his feet. The party continue. We see that one of the crew is carrying an axe. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FIELD / HIGH POINT - DAWN 
A couple of wild dogs watch as our group reach a high point. Chang looks down at Julian who is lying on the ground. The crew stand in the background with Mai. Chang sits next to Julian. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) When you were born - what's the first thing you remember seeing? A beat as Julian struggles to understand Chang's question... Chang stares at him. 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) What do you remember? Beat. 
JULIAN Dark... Darkness. Chang looks at him in a strange way - like this answer has some meaning for him. 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) And do you ever see light? Julian shakes he's head. 
JULIAN No... Never. Chang considers this answer for a long moment. He gets up and returns to Mai - stares at her.... 
CHANG 
(IN THAI) I am the Angel of Vengeance... I restore order and karma. I love all living things... Mai just stares at him - too frightened to move. 
CHANG (CONT'D) 
(IN THAI) ...I want you to walk away from here now... Do you understand? Mai nods. 
CHANG (CONT'D)

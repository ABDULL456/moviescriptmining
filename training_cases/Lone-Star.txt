EXT. TEXAS SCRUB -- DAY 
Two men in shorts and Hawaiian shirts are poking around a sandy section in the middle of scrub flats. SERGEANT CLIFF POTTS is in the f.g., a plant-and-tree guidebook in hand, as SERGEANT "MIKEY" HOGAN works a metal detector over a large, sandy bank in the b.g.  Both are Army career men with a morning off to pursue their hobbies. 
CLIFF We got ocotillo, devil's walking stick--what's this stuff--it's that whattayoucallit--horse-crippler. 
Mikey bends to scoop something out of the sand, putting it in a canvas bag slung on his hip. 
MIKEY This place is a gold mine. 
CLIFF Lead mine. 
MIKEY sees that Cliff is talking, pulls his headset off. 
MIKEY What? 
CLIFF It's a lead mine. 
MIKEY Right. 
CLIFF I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head. 
MIKEY You finding lots of cactus and shit? 
CLIFF It's not just cactus.  There's the nopals, the yuccas-- 
MIKEY (Puts headset on) Looks like a lot of cactus to me. 
CLIFF (Grumbles) Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear. 
MIKEY (Troubled) Cliff-- 
CLIFF You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore-- 
MIKEY Cliff-- 
CU MIKEY 
MIKEY in the f.g. now, looking down at something as he pulls his headset off again-- 
MIKEY Cliff, you gotta look at this-- 
Cliff wearily turns and approaches from the b.g. 
CLIFF Don't tell me--Spanish treasure, right?  Pieces of eight from the Coronado expedition-- 
He stops by Mikey and looks down, his expression changing 
CLIFF Jesus-- 
GROUND -- CU BONES 
Sticking out from the sand bank are the SKELETAL BONES of a MAN'S HAND.  There is a ring on one finger. 
MIKEY (O.S.) Was Coronado in the Masons? 
EXT. ROAD -- DAY 
A distant cloud of DUST appears on the horizon MUSIC underscores that we are in Texas, and we SUPERIMPOSE the OPENING CREDITS as the dust takes form around an APPROACHING CAR.  The car comes close enough to see it has a County Sheriff's insignia on the side. 
INT. CAR 
We see SAM DEEDS, the Sheriff, driving. Sam is 40, quietly competent to the point of seeming a bit moody. He sees something up ahead. 
MUSIC, CREDITS END as Sam pulls off the road and we see the sergeants standing in the scrub. 
EXT. SCRUB -- DAY -- BONES 
The hand and forearm down to the elbow of the skeleton are visible now. 
WIDER 
Cliff stands looking at the arm with Sam. MIKEY is a few yards behind them, playing with his metal detector. Beyond him we see the Sheriff's car parked. 
SAM I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio. 
CLIFF This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction. 
SAM (Nods) I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work. 
CLIFF That ring-- 
SAM Masons been around a long while. 
Mikey has come up to them, still sweeping with the metal detector. 
INT. CAFE SANTA BARBARA -- AFTERNOON -- ENRIQUE 
Sweat beads the forehead of a thin, tired-looking recent immigrant, ENRIQUE, as he delivers platters of chile rellenos to a booth. MEXICAN MUSIC plays on a jukebox in the b.g. We HOLD on the booth, where HOLLIS POGUE, in his 60s entertains two GOOD OLD BOYS-- 
HOLLIS So Buddy walks up to the porch and there's old Fishbait McHenry, cleanin' the dirt out his toenails with a pocketknife--he was the most hygienic of all the McHenrys-- 
The breakfast companions are laughing already-- 
HOLLIS "Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!" 
FENTON (Laughing) Buddy Deeds. He had a way. 
HOLLIS He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, "never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it." 
More laughter-- 
FENTON Won't be another like him. That boy of his doesn't come near it. You ask me, he's all hat and no cattle 
SAM (O.S.) Fellas-- 
We WIDEN to see Sam standing by their booth. No telling how long he's been listening, Fenton is embarrassed. 
HOLLIS Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man. 
FENTON He was a unique individual. 
SAM Yeah, he was that. 
We sense a little strain when Sam has to talk about his father-- 
HOLLIS Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected. 
FENTON Better late than never. Korean War hero, Sheriff for near thirty years-- Buddy Deeds Memorial P-- 
SAM I heard there was a bit of a fuss. 
HOLLIS Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd. 
FENTON Every other damn thing in the country is called after Martin Luther King, they can't let our side have one measly park? 
HOLLIS King wasn't Mexican, Fenton-- 
FENTON Bad enough all the street names are in Spanish-- 
SAM They were here first. 
FENTON Then name it after Big Chief Shitinabucket! Whoever that Tonkawa fella was. He had the Mexes beat by centuries. 
HOLLIS There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben-- 
SAM --Santiago. 
HOLLIS Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news-- 
FENTON They just wanted it to be one of theirs-- 
HOLLIS That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people.  Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him. 
Sam looks to the register where Pilar's mother, MERCEDES CRUZ, whacks rolls of change apart on the counter. She seems to be avoiding looking toward him. 
SAM That so? 
HOLLIS She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part. 
FENTON Tell that one, Hollis-- 
HOLLIS Hell, everybody heard that story a million times. 
SAM I'd like to hear it. Your version of it. 
Something about the way Sam says it puts Hollis on guard. 
FENTON Go ahead, Hollis. 
CU HOLLIS 
Hollis is hooked into it now-- 
HOLLIS The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- 
FENTON (O.S.) '57, 1 believe-- 
HOLLIS And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county. 
He looks down at the table-- 
HOLLIS It was in here one night, back  when Jimmy Herrera run the place.   Started right here in this booth. 
We PAN down to the table, The food has changed. The tortillas are in a straw basket instead of plastic. The jukebox changes to ANOTHER SONG and the LIGHT DIMS slightly. A hand with a big Masonic ring on one finger appears to lift a tortilla-- underneath it lie three ten-dollar bills.  The hand lifts them up and we TILT to see the face of SHERIFF CHARLEY WADE, a big, mean redneck with shrewd eyes. It is 1957-- 
WADE (Grins) This beaner fare doesn't agree with me, but the price sure is right. 
WIDER 
HOLLIS Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning. 
SAM Right. 
HOLLIS Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well-- 
FENTON Your mother was a saint. 
HOLLIS --but Buddy Deeds was my salvation. 
Sam nods, speaks softly-- 
SAM Won't be another like him. 
EXT. ARMY INSTALLATION -- DAY -- CU DEL PAYNE 
COLONEL DELMORE PAYNE (DEL), a very direct, by-the-book Black officer, addresses them. Artillery pieces angle toward the sky behind him-- 
DEL --it's an honor for me to assume command of this unit, and I look forward to working with all of you. 
OFFICERS Cliff and Mikey, in uniform now, flank SERGEANT PRISCILLA WORTH, a Black woman in her early 40s, as they stand in formation-- 
DEL (O.S.) I'm sure you're all aware of the Army's decision to close this installation under the Reduction in Force plan. That does not mean, however-- 
REVERSE 
We look over the shoulders of assembled OFFICERS and NCOs toward Del. 
DEL --that we've been sent here to mark time until we are absorbed by another unit. 
CU DEL 
DEL You may have heard rumors that I run a very tight operation. These rumors are not exaggerated. 
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON -- BUDDY PHOTO 
We are looking through a magnifying glass at an old photo. Buddy's face is slightly distorted by the glass. 
SECRETARY (O.S.) Sam? I got Danny Padilla from the paper for you-- 
Sam sits at his desk in the Sheriff's office, looking down at the photo-- 
SAM Tell him I'll catch him later. 
CU PHOTOGRAPH 
An old photo of the 1957 Sheriff's Department officers on the courthouse steps. Wade, Hollis, Buddy, a few others, all in uniform. 
SECRETARY (O.S.) He says he needs to talk to you before the ceremony, Sam. 
Sam puts a magnifying glass over the photo and bends close to look. 
SAM Tell him to try me tomorrow. 
EXTREME CU PHOTO -- BADGE 
MAGNIFIED POV of the badge on Wade's chest swims into view. A metal star. We hear the secretary getting rid of the caller. 
SECRETARY (O.S.) He thinks you're trying to duck him. 
CU SAM 
Looking at the photo, troubled-- 
SAM (Mutters) He's right. 
EXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- NIGHT -- NEON SIGN 
We start on a BLINKING SIGN--BIG O'S, then PAN to see a full parking lot outside the low, neon-lit roadhouse. R&B MUSIC blasts from inside. 
EXT. DOORWAY -- CHET 
CHET, a Black kid around 15, stands nervously at the door building up his courage.  He takes a deep breath, plunges in. 
INT. BIG O'S 
We TRACK with Chet, very nervous, as he makes his way through the crowded roadhouse. The customers are all Black, many from the nearby Army post, SHOUTING and LAUGHING over the loud MUSIC. Chet, edgy, is looking for somebody.  He sees... 
CHET'S POV -- OTIS 
Seen through the crush is OTIS "BIG O" PAYNE, a large man in his early 60s, laughing as he stands behind the bar. 
CHET 
He nervously puts his hand under his jacket. A gun? He pushes forward to get a better view. 
CHET'S POV -- OTIS 
Moving in on him. Otis looks over, sees the boy, frowns-- 
CHET 
Reaching under his jacket, he pulls out--a photograph. He looks at it--suddenly there is a SCREAM from behind, then GUNSHOTS, patrons diving for the floor. 
CU PRINCIPAL 
Weary-- 
PRINCIPAL Would you people like to form another committee? 
GROANS from the parents-- 
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- SHADOW 
Shadow, face bruised, hands cuffed behind him, is pushed in through the door to be booked. 
SHADOW I hope the sucker does die, man! Mess with me, that's what you get! 
Sam steps in behind him and meets his Chief Deputy RAY HERNANDEZ, coming from the other direction. 
RAY Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape-- 
SAM (Glances ahead) The shooter local? 
RAY (Shakes his bead) Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before. 
SAM Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club. 
RAY Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today? 
SAM Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later. 
As Ray steps out, Pilar looking distraught, walks into the station, passing right by Sam without seeing him. 
CU SAM 
Wonders what she's doing there-- 
SAM'S POV -- PILAR 
She stands by an unoccupied reception desk, very upset, unable to attract anyone's attention because of the activity around the shooting.  She looks tired and a bit scared under the harsh overhead light. 
SAM (O.S.) Pilar. 
PILAR AND SAM 
Pilar looks around. Sam is standing by her. We can tell there is some history between these two. 
SAM Something wrong? 
PILAR They've got my Amado. 
SAM Got him here? 
PILAR Somebody called--something about an electronics store. 
SAM I'll see what's going on. 
He starts away, stops, comes back-- 
SAM I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since. 
PILAR We haven't talked since high school. 
SAM Yeah. I'll go check on your boy. 
Pilar watches Sam go-- 
REAR OF OFFICE 
Travis sits typing away at a word processor as Athena, in tears, gives testimony. 
ATHENA --so Richie just didn't say nothin' 'cause he didn't want to get into it, see, and the next thing I know there's shots and Richie is down. It happened so fast-- 
SAM (O.S.) Excuse me-- 
We WIDEN to see Sam standing over the desk-- 
SAM We got some boys you run in earlier today? 
TRAVIS Yeah. I pulled the bunch that hangs at Pico Bernal's place. We finally caught them with something. 
SAM You got a juvenile with 'ern--Amado Cruz? 
Travis looks at his booking sheets-- 
TRAVIS Yeah--let's see--the other ones say he wasn't in on the theft, he just knows how to hook things up. We've been trying to contact a parent. 
INT. JAIL HALLWAY 
Sam walks with Amado, who is trying to look defiant-- 
SAM They tell me you're good at fixing things. 
Nothin-- 
SAM Your father was a hell of a mechanic. 
SAM Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down. 
They shake, Sam sits. 
BEN How's business? 
SAM Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated. 
BEN I hear they're closing that post down. 
SAM September '97, that's all she wrote. 
BEN Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county. 
SAM Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops. 
Sam looks at the folder of reports. 
SAM That the word on our boy? 
BEN Yeah, this is Skinny. 
SAM Skinny? 
BEN We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones. 
SAM Nice job. 
BEN (Opens folder) Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records-- 
SAM Charley Wade. 
BEN (Nods) That badge-- 
SAM --it didn't come out of a cereal box. 
BEN Yeah. 
SAM You know the popular version of how he left town. 
BEN Everybody on the border knows that story. 
SAM You got a cause of death? 
BEN Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on. 
SAM So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack. 
Ben smiles, closes the folder-- 
BEN You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm? 
SAM Colt Peacemaker. 
BEN A .45-- 
SAM He swore by it. (Ben frowns) What? 
BEN Just wondering. 
SAM So is Buddy on your short list? 
BEN If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen. 
SAM You got to investigate. No question about it. 
BEN What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old. 
SAM Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail. 
They sit in awkward silence for a moment. Ben feels bad about it. 
BEN I remember Charley Wade come to my father's hardware store once when I was a little boy. I'd heard stories how he shot this one, how he shot that one--man winked at me and I peed in my pants. (Shakes his head) Winked at me. 
INT. CLASSROOM -- DAY 
Pilar stands at the blackboard by her outline of 19th century Texas history. 
PILAR Okay, we have the fight against the Spanish with bloody conflict for dozens of years till they're finally defeated in 1821 and Mexican independence is declared. Anglo settlers are invited-- 
CU DRAWING 
Somebody making a skillful pencil drawing on the corner of a sheet of lined notebook paper. A bald, muscular shotputter after releasing the shot, his hand large in the f.g. 
PILAR (O.S.) --to colonize the area and by the time they begin the movement against Santa Anna they outnumber the Mexicans here by four to one. The war between Mexico-- 
CHET 
Drawing intently. He takes the notebook and lays his thumb over the corner. 
PILAR (O.S.) and the Anglo forces ends in 1836 with the formation of the Texas Republic. Texas joins the United States as a state where slavery is legal in 1845-- 
NOTEBOOK 
INT. CLASSROOM -- ARMY BASE -- DAY -- CU ATHENA 
Athena stands at attention, trying to keep her composure-- 
CLIFF (O.S.) So you knew this young man before? 
ATHENA From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street. 
PRISCILLA (O.S.) Did you know he was going to be there last night? 
ATHENA If I had I wouldn't have gone in. 
PRISCILLA (O.S.) And you and Private Graves-- 
ATHENA We were just dancing-- 
WIDER 
Cliff leans against a desk, a blackboard covered with radar diagrams behind him. Priscilla sits nearby, both of them focused on Athena. 
PRISCILLA We're not running a dating service here. 
ATHENA I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble. 
CLIFF It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here-- 
ATHENA I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy-- 
A silence as the sergeant lets her stew for a moment. She works up her courage-- 
ATHENA Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves? 
CLIFF He'll live. 
PRISCILLA He'll be transferred to a military hospital as soon as he's stabilized-- 
CLIFF He'll probably be getting a medical discharge-- 
ATHENA Out of the Army? 
CLIFF He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena-- 
ATHENA Will this go on my record? 
Cliff considers for a long moment-- 
CLIFF If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction. 
ATHENA Thank you, Sergeant Major. 
CLIFF You're dismissed. 
ATHENA Thank you, Sergeant Major. 
Athena steps out of the room. Cliff sits on the desk-- 
PRISCILLA You spoil 'em, Cliff. 
CLIFF Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack-- 
PRISCILLA But I'm the one in charge of her sorry ass. 
CLIFF She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood. 
Crossing to the door-- 
PRISCILLA And if she isn't careful she's gonna slide right back into it. 
EXT. BLEDSOE HOUSE -- DAY -- ROCKER 
We start on a CU of a rocker creaking back and forth on an old wooden porch. A WOMAN HUMS. 
MINNIE 
MINNIE BLEDSOE, in her 60s, sits on her porch in the old Black section of town, playing with a Gameboy. She has very thick glasses on. Sam walks up to her from his car-- 
SAM Mrs. Bledsoe? 
MINNIE That's me. 
SAM I'm Sheriff Deeds-- 
MINNIE Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior. 
SAM (Smiles) Yeah, that's the story of my life. 
MINNIE You ever play one of these? 
SAM I've seen 'em. 
MINNIE Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone. 
SAM You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick? 
WADE Whoah, son. You're not finished. Pour his. 
YOUNG HOLLIS I prefer it in the bottle-- 
WADE Shut up, Hollis. Pour. 
Otis meets Wade's look now, pours the other beer-- 
WADE How come you don't took familiar? 
YOUNG OTIS Been away. Up to Houston. 
WADE Houston, huh? I hear they let you boys run wild up there. 
No response. Wade deliberately pushes the glass away so beer splashes on the table and drips into Hollis's lap-- 
WADE Aw--look what you done now. Better get something to wipe it up, son. 
Half the people in the room are watching now, the other half moving away to relative safety. Otis tries to keep a lid on his temper, looks around the room-- 
YOUNG OTIS You spilt it, you wipe it up. 
Wade stands, steely-eyed, and looks at Otis nose to nose-- 
WADE I told you to do something. Are you gonna hop to it, or are we gonna have a problem? 
Otis is starting to shake, but holds his ground-- 
WADE Don't want to turn tail in front of your people. I understand. 
He starts to turn away then WHAP! brings the butt of his pistol up under Otis's chin, knocking him to the floor. A woman SCREAMS and Otis, enraged, grabs the chair he has fallen over, starts to get up--but Wade has the pistol levelled at his face-- 
WADE Come on, Houston, give it a try! Come to Poppa-- 
RODERICK is out on the floor now, hands held out in a gesture of peace, as YOUNG MINNIE watches from behind the bar, petrified-- 
RODERICK Don't mind him, Sheriff. Boy's just a bit slow, is all. He don't mean nothin' by it-- 
WADE That the problem, son?  You Slow? 
RODERICK Otis, apologize to the Sheriff-- 
Otis eases the chair down but doesn't say anything-- 
RODERICK You got him too scared to peep, Sheriff. Maybe if you put that gun up-- 
WADE You telling me what to do, Roderick? 
RODERICK No, Sheriff, I'm just-- 
Wade looks around, widens his eyes in mock surprise-- 
WADE What's this I see? Is that whiskey in them glasses on the Bar? Roderick, I'm gonna have to cite you for a violation of state law-- 
RODERICK This is a club, Sheriff--you been in here-- 
WADE And people better clear out of here! Now! 
A few people start for the exit.  Wade swivels and BLAM sends a bullet past Minnie that shatters a crystal decanter behind the bar.  People run for the door. Wade squats down to look Otis in the face-- 
CU WADE 
WADE You learn how to act your place, son. This idn't Houston. 
He stands and we FOLLOW him toward the bar-- 
OTIS (V.O.) 'Course I was young and full of beans then-- 
The camera passes Wade and instead of Minnie there stands Otis, PRESENT DAY, reminiscing. We are back in '95-- 
OTIS I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in. 
SAM And that was the last time you saw him? 
We SHIFT to see Sam sitting where Wade was headed-- 
OTIS Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope. 
SAM That was the night he disappeared? 
OTIS (Shakes his head) Could of been. That was white people's business. 
SAM And when my father was Sheriff? 
OTIS What about it? 
SAM What was your deal with him? 
Otis smiles, chooses his words carefully-- 
OTIS Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side. (Smiles) Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black  folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged. 
SAM He ever accept cash for a favor? 
We TRACK down a hallway as Celie walks toward us, calling ahead. Chet stands in the middle of the hall behind her. 
CELIE (O.S.) I don't see what the big deal is. Go back over, talk to the man, and bury the hatchet, Del-- 
CELIE passes us and Del crosses back in the other direction from behind the camera, carrying boxes of their belongings. We continue our SLOW TRACK forward-- 
DEL Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life. 
CHET Dad-- 
CELIE (O.S.) You were 8 years old when he left-- 
DEL He didn't leave, he moved three houses down with one of my mother's best friends. 
CHET Dad--? 
DEL "Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?" 
Del disappears into the bedroom at the end of the hall-- 
DEL (O.S.) Everybody else's business. And everybody loved Big O-- 
DEL comes back out, empty-handed-- 
DEL Big O was always there with a  smile or a loan or a free drink. 
CHET Dad, can I talk to you about track? 
CELIE (O.S.) People change. 
DEL Not that much. 
CHET Dad, I talked to the track coach-- 
DEL I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough-- 
CHET I have a B average. 
DEL How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point? 
CELIE (O.S.) We're going to have to see him. 
DEL No, we don't. 
Del steps away past us, leaving Chet, defeated-- 
INT. CAFE -- NIGHT -- ENRIQUE 
We start on Enrique, talking surreptitiously on the pay phone on the way to the kitchen. 
ENRIQUE Sabado por la noche--Is, es el  mas seguero--a cruzar por la  manana y pues tendremos que esperar--[Friday night--Yes, that's the safest--I'll cross in the morning and then we'll have to wait--] 
Mercedes bustles by, snapping her fingers-- 
MERCEDES Off the phone, by we've got people waiting. Andale! 
We FOLLOW Mercedes back into the kitchen, where she moves through, kibbitzing the operation-- 
WAITRESS 
Mercedes stops by a young girl prepping a pork loin to be cooked. She isn't wearing gloves. 
MERCEDES Donde estan sus guantes? Tonta! Quiere matar a mis clientes? [Where are your gloves? Stupid! You want to kill my customers?] 
She continues past, shaking her bead, bringing us to Pilar, who is trying to stay out of the way-- 
MERCEDES These ones coming up are getting stupider every year. 
PILAR Maybe you're just getting less patient. 
MERCEDES If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan! 
PILAR Well, you hire illegals-- 
MERCEDES (Indignant) Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy. 
PILAR If you spent a little more time training them-- 
MERCEDES Did you come here to tell me how to run my business? 
PILAR No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up-- 
MERCEDES Why would I want to go there? 
PILAR Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon-- 
MERCEDES You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them. 
Pilar gives up on the trip. She watches her mother poking at the plates of chips and salsa ready to go out-- 
PILAR Mami, how old were you when my father-- 
MERCEDES He was killed. 
CLIFF Seriously, I think we should get married. 
PRISCILLA We been through this before-- 
CLIFF We should just do it. 
PRISCILLA And if I get a shot at a promotion somewhere-- 
CLIFF You could take it-- 
PRISCILLA It's up or out these days, Cliff. Say I get transferred to a different post-- 
CLIFF I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that. 
PRISCILLA (Grins) Man's gonna retire in two years and he offer to quit. Big goddamn deal. 
SAM (O.S.) Excuse me-- 
They look up to see Sam standing over them-- 
CLIFF Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth. 
SAM Pleased to meet you. 
CLIFF Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday. 
PRISCILLA It true they gonna build a shopping mall out there? 
SAM If certain people have their way, it's going to be a new jail. 
PRISCILLA Damn. Maybe we got in the wrong business. They closin' down military bases left and right, puttin' up jails like 7-11 stores. 
SAM Do either of you have any idea when they stopped using that site as a rifle range? 
CLIFF They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year. 
PRISCILLA You know who it was they dug up? 
SAM Not for sure yet. But I kind of wish they hadn't. 
EXT. CAFE -- NIGHT 
Enrique steps out of the darkened cafe, followed by Mercedes, who locks up. Mercedes steps over to an expensive-looking car-- 
ENRIQUE Es muy lindo, su coche-- 
MERCEDES En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English. 
ENRIQUE Is very beautiful, your car. 
MERCEDES Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car-- 
ENRIQUE Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction-- 
FADE OUT 
EXT. BIG O'S ROADHOUSE -- DAY -- CU DEL 
Del, in uniform, approaches the front door of Big O's, not open for business yet. We TIGHTEN as he stops to read a handlettered sign next to it: "BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT REAR ENTRANCE." He steps in-- 
INT. ROADHOUSE 
Late-50s R&B plays on the JUKEBOX. Otis stands behind the counter hooking the beer taps up. Del steps in and sits on a stool at the far end of the bar, tense, looking around the place. When Otis sees him, he stops dead. They lock eyes for a moment, then Otis turns to call. 
OTIS Carolyn--knock that off for a minute. 
CAROLYN 
CAROLYN SYKES, an attractive woman maybe ten years younger than Otis, pulls the plug from the jukebox near where she's scrubbing bloodstains off the floor. She turns to look at the newcomer-- 
BAR 
Del doesn't move to come closer-- 
DEL Black Seminoles? 
OTIS (Shrugs) Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission. 
Del nods toward where Carolyn is mopping-- 
DEL That where he was shot? 
OTIS That's where he fell. 
DEL You get much of that in here? 
OTIS It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out-- 
DEL Deal drugs in the bathroom-- 
OTIS If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands. 
Carolyn has come over by Otis, lugging the bucket and mop-- 
H.L. Which is why we need to talk to you about the new jail--just so we're all on the same page. 
SAM We don't need a new jail. 
H.L. That's a matter of interpretation-- 
SAM We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow-- 
JORGE There was a mandate in the last election-- 
SAM It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters-- 
H.L. Dammit, Sam, the people are concerned about crime-- 
SAM We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school-- 
JORGE There isn't money allocated for that. But a jail-- 
SAM Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail. 
H.L. When we backed you-- 
SAM When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office.  Hey, folks-- 
Sam and the others smile as they reach the CROWD of townspeople, mostly small business owners and retired people. Photographers from the paper and a local TV news crew wait by a veiled Statue roped off in a little traffic island. Mercedes, dressed to kill, stands waiting next to Hollis with a huge pair of scissors in her hand. 
CU MERCEDES 
Slowly working the blades of the scissors, she looks coldly at Sam-- 
CU SAM 
He nods to her as the crowd opens a path for him. 
SAM Let's get this thing over with. 
INT. MIKEY'S WORKSHOP -- MORNING 
We start on a two-foot-high statue of a cowboy made from old bullets and shell casings. We PAN past a few others, the poses lifted from Frederic Remington paintings, till we see Mikey, gluing together a work in progress, a Remington book propped open in front of him. Cliff sits at the worktable playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from MIKEY'S bag 
MIKEY Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder. 
CLIFF I think it's beyond what you'd call dating. 
MIKEY You going to get married? 
CLIFF (Shrugs) Maybe. 
MIKEY You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy? 
CLIFF Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man-- 
MIKEY Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice.  But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse. 
Cliff picks up a slug-- 
CLIFF Hey, Mikey-- 
MIKEY I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part-- 
CLIFF Mikey-- 
MIKEY Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains-- 
CLIFF Mikey-- 
MIKEY If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine-- 
CLIFF Mikey look at this-- 
MIKEY What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here. 
CLIFF It's a .45. 
MIKEY Yeah? 
CLIFF This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber-- 
MIKEY They were using M-1's, yeah-- 
CLIFF What's it doing on a rifle range? 
MIKEY holds the slug in front of his face-- 
MIKEY We better call that Sheriff. 
EXT. SAN JACINTO STREET -- DAY 
Hollis is finishing his oration, having put the crowd in a good mood. 
HOLLIS Sometime in the early '70s a reporter from a national magazine was talking to the governor of our Lone Star state, and he asked him, "Governor, what's your ideal of what a real Texan ought to be?" Governor said, "That's easy, son- you just go down to Rio County and get a look at Sheriff Buddy Deeds." 
Applause-- 
Wade falls on his face. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM flicks ON and plays over his body. We PAN back along the be to see Buddy, holstering his Pistol. He hears something, swings the flashlight up. 
SAM 
We are back in 1995. Sam is blasted in the face with a FLASHLIGHT BEAM-- 
PATROLMAN (O.S.) Hold it right there! Brazos  arriba! Sam, squinting toward the light to see who it is, raises his hands over his head-- 
ZACK (O.S.) Get that thing off 'im! He's one of ours-- 
SAM Zack? 
The FLASHLIGHT BEAM PANS AWAY and ZACK POLLARD, a Border Patrol agent, steps out of the dark to Sam-- 
ZACK Hey Sam. Sorry 'bout that. 
SAM What's up? 
ZACK We had about a dozen wets come over just upriver. They ran into one of our posts--it was like a breakshot on a pool table, illegals runnin' every which way. 
SAM I haven't seen anybody come by. 
ZACK We'll get 'em-- (Looks around) So you livin' out here now? 
SAM Yeah. It's quiet-- 
ZACK I heard about that deal for your father--You must be real proud. 
SAM Sure. 
ZACK The stories people tell, he was a real colorful fella-- 
PATROLMAN (O.S.) Zack! We got one! 
ZACK Well--back on the clock. You see any of our neighbors from the south, let 'em know I'm lookin' for 'em. 
SAM 'Night-- 
Zack steps away.  Sam shakes the pecans still in his band, goes back to chucking them-- 
EXT. COURTYARD -- DANCERS 
Older CHICANO COUPLES dance to Mexican Music playing from speakers set up in the apartment complex courtyard.  We TILT UP to see Enrique watching from his window-- 
INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
MUSIC still blasting.  Enrique steps away from the window, and sits on the bed of his drab furnished apartment. He goes back to tying knots in a length of clothesline splicing it to another. On the bed beside him are new flashlights and the batteries, still in their packaging. He begins to coil the rope--it is hundreds of feet long. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH, PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
Pilar sits on her front Porch, listening to the MUSIC in the distance. A woman singing a MEXICAN LOVE BALLAD. After a while we hear Paloma open the screen door behind her-- 
PALOMA (O.S.) Mom? 
PILAR Yeah? 
PALOMA (O.S.) You gonna stay out here? 
PILAR For a while. 
A silence. They listen to the RECORD-- 
PALOMA (O.S.) What's she singing about? 
PILAR (Smiles) What do you think? 
FADE OUT 
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- EARLY MORNING 
Sam has been up since dawn, searching through piles of old department records. Papers cover his desk and the chairs he's dragged over next to it. He reads out loud himself from a report in front of him-- 
SAM First bullet entered beneath the left eye, severing the optical nerve and exiting from top rear of skull causing tissue damage 
DOCUMENTS -- VARIOUS SHOTS 
As Sam reads, we see quick pops of various records-- Certificates of death. An old Sheriff's Department payroll. An autopsy report. Eviction notices. 
SAM (O.S.) --and severe cerebral hemorrhaging. Second bullet entered left cheek driving fragment of upper and lower molars into base of skull. Third bullet-- 
Real estate transfers. A map of the Proposed Lake Pescadero. Another autopsy report. A FAX COPY of the forensics dental report on Charley Wade. Another autopsy report-- 
CU SAM 
Intent as he pores over the paperwork--

We come to Sam's hand, writing, when it clears we can read the last entry-- 
Mercedes Cruz hired as cook, Rio Co. jail--4/57 ????? 
RAY Yeah. 
SAM You'd do a good job. 
RAY How 'bout you? 
SAM Don't know if I'll still want it. 
RAY I didn't want to be going around your back. 
SAM I appreciate you telling me. 
Sam looks at his Chief Deputy-- 
SAM You think we need a new jail? 
RAY Well, it's a complicated issue-- 
Sam smiles, turns the engine on-- 
SAM Yeah, Ray, you'd be a hell of a Sheriff. 
EXT. SCHOOL -- MORNING 
Pilar sits with Amado on the football field bleachers before school starts-- 
PILAR I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college-- 
AMADO I can't take any more school. 
PILAR --you're going to be on your own. 
AMADO So? 
PILAR So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends. 
AMADO They're not going to jail. 
PILAR Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things. 
AMADO Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year. 
PILAR That makes it okay? 
AMADO They stole our land-- 
PILAR Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me. 
A silence. Amado sulks. 
PILAR How do you think you're going to make a living? 
AMADO I can fix cars. 
PILAR You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized-- 
AMADO You think I can't learn that? 
PILAR I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for-- 
AMADO I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste. 
PILAR That isn't true. 
AMADO Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad-- 
PILAR If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled. 
They look, at each other for a long moment. 
AMADO It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business. 
PILAR (Nods) I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age. 
AMADO And what did she do? 
PILAR Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help. 
AMADO Catholic school, nasty. 
Pilar is nearly in tears. 
PILAR Honey, I think you're smart and you're good and I love you. So don't act like an idiot, all right? 
EXT. BORDER CROSSING -- DAY 
We see Sam's car roll through the "express lane" as other cars in both directions stop by the inspection booths. Sam drives across the bridge over the Rio-- 
EXT. STREETS -- CIUDAD LEON -- VARIOUS SHOTS 
Sam drives slowly through the sprawling, more populous town on the other side.  Lots of the streets are unpaved.  We PAN with the car till we HOLD on ANSELMA, a country girl of 15, aimlessly walking the streets-- 
EXT. LLANTERIA (TIRE REPAIR SHOP) -- DAY 
ELADIO Not much, jefe. Some watermelons. 
WADE I heard somebody been haulin' wets on this road. 
ELADIO I haven't seen anybody doing that. 
WADE This same person been bragging all over the county how he don't have to cut that big gringo Sheriff in on it-- he can run his own operation 'thout any help. Como se llama, amigo? 
ELADIO Eladio Cruz. 
WADE You know this road got a bad reputation, Eladio-- 
ARROYO -- CHUCHO 
Young CHUCHO pecks over the edge to see what's happening. 
ELADIO Reputation? 
WADE Bandidos, Injuns-- 
CLOSER -- MEN 
Hollis wanders over to stand by Wade-- 
WADE There's many an unfortunate soul been ambushed out on this stretch. Hope you're carrying some protection. 
ELADIO Protection? 
WADE You carryin' a firearm, son?  Don't lie to me now. 
ELADIO Si--tengo escopeto--just a shotgun-- 
WADE Just a shotgun, huh? Better let me take a look at that. 
ELADIO opens the truck door and digs under the seat. Wade winks to Hollis, then turns and BLAM! shoots ELADIO through the head. Hollis jumps back startled and horrified-- 
YOUNG HOLLIS Oh no--oh Jesus--oh my Lord-- 
WADE Little greaser sonofabitch been running a goddarn bus service. Think he can make a fool out of Charley Wade! Get them wets outta the back, Hollis, see what we've got-- 
CU CHUCHO 
Squatting in a ball to make himself as small as possible, eyes covered with his hands. 
YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.) You killed him-- 
WADE (O.S.) You got a talent for statin' the obvious, son Muchachos! Venga afuera!Brazos arribas! [Come on out! Hands up!] 
Young CHUCHO hears FOOTSTEPS approaching. We PAN as he looks-- a man's BOOTS appear at the top of the arroyo. We TILT UP to see a Sheriff, BACKLIT, then CRANE to see it is Sam, back in the PRESENT looking over the site, troubled. His car sits on the empty road behind him. He frowns, turns to go-- 
EXT. PARK -- DAY -- PLAQUE 
Somebody has spray-painted "PERDIDO!" over the plaque of Buddy and the little boy-- 
HOLLIS (O.S.) Hooligans-- 
WIDER 
Hollis and a couple of MEN from the Public Work Department look at the damage. 
HOLLIS It happens again, we build a fence around it. 
INT. CAFE -- DAY 
Enrique steels himself, trying to cover his nerves. We CROSS with him to a booth. 
ZACK Podemos ganar muchas batallas pero la guerra ya es perdido--[We can win a lot of battles but the war's already been lost--] 
Zack and another BORDER PATROLMAN look up at him-- 
CU ENRIQUE 
Eyes glued to his notepad-- 
ENRIQUE You wan' something to drink? 
EXT. ROADSIDE STAND -- DAY -- CU CATTLE SKULL 
A Georgia O'Keefe-looking cattle skull sits on a pedestal against the Western sky-- 
WESLEY (O.S.) The longhorns go for ten times the price-- 
We WIDEN as the skull is lifted by WESLEY BIRDSONG, a Native American man in his 70s who wears extremely thick glasses. Sam tags along as the old man rearranges the display of Texas curios laid out in front of his trailer. Empty scrubland surrounds them. 
WESLEY --but longhorns are hard to come by these days. 
SAM You sell much out here? 
WESLEY How am I gonna sell things if nobody comes by? This stretch of road runs between Nowheres and Nothin' Much. 
SAM Hell of a spot to put a business. 
WESLEY But you don't see much competition, do you? 
It is 1972. An early-'70s cheezy action picture (Filipino women-in-chains or biker flick is playing. We TILT DOWN to a man's BOOTS crunching across the gravel of the parking area. Now and then, the man turns a FLASHLIGHT BEAM on a license plate. The cars are all pre-'72, lots of pickups, and the patrons are almost all TEENAGERS. Some have turned their pickups around to sit on the tailgate and watch, while others have set lawn furniture out to sit on. We TILT UP slightly to see the glint of a Rio County Sheriff's badge pinned on the man's shirt. He meets a DEPUTY coming in the other direction. Both train their FLASHLIGHTS on the license of the car we see in the b.g. between them.  We TILT and RACK to see that nobody is visible through the window-- 
BUDDY (O.S.) Let's go. 
We FOLLOW Buddy up to the driver's side of the car as the Deputy goes to the passenger side. We PAN with Buddy's hand down to the door handle--he grabs it, flings it open--the overhead LIGHT flicks ON and there lie YOUNG SAM and PILAR, teenagers, half their clothes off and just about to close the deal. PILAR SCREAMS and the Deputy throws the door open by their heads-- 
BUDDY Goddammit! 
Buddy grabs Sam's ankles and yanks him out of the car onto the ground as the Deputy awkwardly pulls PILAR, out the other side-- 
YOUNG SAM What the hell are you doing? You fucking asshole! 
BUDDY How old is that girl? Goddammit, where's your goddam sense? 
YOUNG PILAR (O.S.) Let me go!  Pendejo! 
YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.) Come on now, Missy, get your clothes in order-- 
Sam is trying to kick and punch at his father, pausing in between to pull his pants up. People are BOOING and HONKING their HORNS all around-- 
YOUNG SAM You got no fuckin' right! You stay out of my fuckin' life! 
BUDDY Gimme the keys--gimme the goddamn car keys, son-- 
YOUNG HOLLIS (O.S.) What am I s'posed to do with her, Buddy? 
BUDDY You drive her home and tell her mother where we found her-- 
YOUNG PILAR (O.S.) Sam! 
The kids are dragged forward into the HEADLIGHTS that are being turned on to see what the ruckus is. Both are crying, struggling-- 
YOUNG SAM You leave her the fuck alone! 
BUDDY You just shut that filthy mouth, son. I'll deal with you when we get home-- 
YOUNG PILAR Please, don't tell my mother! She's gonna kill me! 
They step closer into the glaring HEADLIGHTS which WHITE OUT the scene, then FADE. 
EXT. RUINED DRIVE-IN -- DUSK 
It is DUSK, PRESENT DAY. Our eyes readjust to see Sam, standing by his car in the lot of the long-abandoned drive- in. The ruined screen rises in the b.g. 
CU SAM 
Remembering. MUSIC BEGINS as he gets back into the car, pulls away. 
MARQUEE -- DUSK 
MUSIC CONTINUES as the car cruises out past the old marquee, a few letters still jumbled on it, several bullet holes around them. 
INT. CAR 
MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam drives, thinking-- 
EXT. ROADS -- VARIOUS SHOTS -- DUSK/NIGHT 
MUSIC CONTINUES as the car crosses the scrubland back toward town. DUSK turns to NIGHT-- 
EXT. PILAR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam cruises past Pilar's house. The car is not in the driveway: Paloma hangs out with a couple FRIENDS under the porch light, laughing-- 
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL -- NIGHT 
MUSIC CONTINUES as Sam's car pulls into the high school lot. He looks up toward the school-- 
EXT. WINDOW, PILAR, -- SAM'S POV 
MUSIC CONTINUES. We can see PILAR, through the lighted window of her classroom, preparing something on the blackboard-- 
INT. CAR 
MUSIC ENDS as Sam leans back to wait-- 
EXT. PARKING LOT 
PILAR digs in her bag for her car keys as she makes her way across the lot. She sees something, slows, reacting, then brings us to Sam in his car. He has parked head-to-foot next to hers. They look at each other for a long moment 
PILAR (Softly) Follow me. 
EXT. MAIN STREET -- NIGHT 
Nothing stirring. Pilar's car appears, closely followed by Sam's. The cafe has closed for the night. 
INT. CAFE -- NIGHT 
Sam and Pilar sit on chairs next to each other, facing the window, talking softly. The STREETLIGHT shining through the letters in the front window makes patterns on their faces 
PILAR We thought we were something, didn't we? 
SAM Yeah. 
PALOMA How come? 
PILAR Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys. 
PILAR steps out into the sun-- 
PALOMA Did it work? 
INT. CAFE -- MORNING 
Hollis is sitting alone in a booth, working on some heuvos rancheros.  Sam slides in across from him-- 
SAM Morning, Hollis. 
HOLLIS Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something. 
SAM You thought any more about our murder? 
HOLLIS We have a murder? 
SAM Charley Wade. 
HOLLIS I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't. 
SAM I got an idea what happened. 
HOLLIS Do you? 
SAM I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back. 
Hollis sits back to look Sam in the eye-- 
HOLLIS You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that? 
SAM I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight. 
Sam stands and walks away. We HOLD on Hollis, his appetite gone-- 
EXT. BIG O'S -- MORNING 
Chet steps around to the side entrance-- 
INT. BLACK SEMINOLE EXHIBIT -- DAY -- CU STATUE 
We start on a statue of a BUFFALO SOLDIER made from spent bullets and shell casings, then PAN to another, then WIDEN to see Chet as he pokes his head in, the BELL of the door ringing.  He steps in cautiously, looking around the room. On the walls there are photo-blowups, some artifacts, handlettered information on cardboard. Chet stops to look up at a picture of a barechested Black man with a couple of feathers stuck in his headband 
OTIS (O.S.) That's John Horse. 
Chet turns to see Otis standing back by, the door from the bar-- 
OTIS Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse. 
CHET (Looks at picture) He a Black man or an Indian? 
OTIS (Steps in) Both. 
Otis crosses to the poker table, begins to clean up-- 
OTIS He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma-- 
CHET The Trail of Tears. 
OTIS (Smiles) They teaching that now?  Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee. 
CHET So they stayed in Florida? 
OTIS They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass. 
They move on to some photos of very African-looking people dressed in beautiful Seminole clothing-- 
OTIS Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche-- 
CHET They fought against the Indians? 
OTIS Same as they done in Mexico. 
CHET But they were Indians themselves. 
OTIS They were in the Army. Like your father. 
CHET (Surprised) You know who I am? 
OTIS I got a pretty good guess. 
CHET That guy who got shot-- 
OTIS You didn't go telling your father you were here? 
CHET Are you kidding? And face a court- martial? 
OTIS (Smiles) He's a pretty tough old man, huh? 
CHET No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's-- 
Del squirm a bit at the word "father"-- 
DEL You've been in this house for a while? 
CAROLYN I been here with him eight years now. He built it when he was with Leora. 
DEL I never met her. 
CAROLYN There was a bunch of 'em You never met. Me neither. 
Del looks around the living room-- 
CAROLYN Let me show you around-- 
INT. DEN -- PHOTOGRAPH 
A blowup of a photo of a squad of Buffalo Soldiers is mounted on the wall-- 
CAROLYN (O.S.) He got into all this cowboys and Indians stuff awhile back. Spend half his time pokin' around in the library way up to Austin. 
CU DEL 
He looks at something below -- 
DEL'S POV -- CLIPPINGS 
We PAN slowly over laminated newspaper clippings mounted behind a picture of young Del in a track uniform, holding a vaulting pole. The clippings are about Del making honor rolls, winning a Silver Star in Vietnam, graduating from Officer Candidate School, being named head of this and that in the Army-- 
CAROLYN (O.S.) Kind of like a shrine, isn't it? 
DEL, CAROLYN 
Carolyn stands behind, watching Del's face as he looks at the stuff-- 
DEL Where'd he get all this? 
CAROLYN Your mother got a brother--Alphonse-- 
DEL Uncle Al-- 
CAROLYN Otis stood on good terms with the man. Whenever you do something makes the news, he sends it on. When they made you General, Otis just about drove away all our customers going on about it. 
DEL I'm a colonel. 
CAROLYN Yeah, I know--Man made me memorize the whole damn Army chain of command before he'd marry me. So this is a big deal, commander and  all? 
DEL It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command. 
CAROLYN Otis went on like you were that guy who won the Gulf War. Colin whatsit. 
DEL My mother said he never asked about-- 
CAROLYN He never asked her. 
It's a bit too much for Del-- 
DEL Listen, I uh--tell him I came by. Thanks-- 
We HOLD on Carolyn as he hurries out. She salutes-- 
CAROLYN Catch you later, Colonel. 
EXT. RIVER -- NIGHT 
PEOPLE, crouching low, wade across the river toward us. When he gets close enough to us, we recognize Enrique, nervously leading a group of Mexican men, women and children to the U.S. side. They are spaced out in the dark, loosely holding the line Enrique made in one hand and holding their bundles high away from the water with the other. Enrique turns as he hears a WOMAN'S CRY.  The line goes slack, then NESTOR steps out of the darkness to join him-- 
ENRIQUE Que Paso? [What happened?] 
NESTOR Anselma cayo en las rocas. Creo que la pierna ha sido root--[Anselma felt on the rocks. I think her leg's broken--] 
Two men struggle forward supporting Anselma, trying to hold her leg out straight in front of her. She is in a lot of pain-- 
NESTOR No podemos alcanzar el camion llevando a ella. Hay lugar para esconderla? [We can't reach the truck if we're carrying her. Is there somewhere to hide her?] 
Enrique thinks, trying not to panic, as the others come up around him-- 
ENRIQUE Conozco solamente una persona con casa--[I only know one person with a house--] 
ANSELMA (In pain) Esta lejos? [Is it far?] 
EXT. PATIO -- NIGHT 
Mercedes sits on her recliner, drink in hand. An old RECORD plays from inside. She is startled by the voice from the dark-- 
ENRIQUE (O.S.) Senora Cruz? 
MERCEDES (Standing) Quien es? [Who is it?] 
ENRIQUE Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo-- [It's me, Enrique. Don't be afraid] 
Enrique steps out into the light. His pants are wet and he's scared-- 
MERCEDES What are you doing out there? Are you crazy? 
EXT. MERCEDES' HOUSE -- MERCEDES 
Mercedes is lost in thought as she recalls. She steps into the light by the carport. Enrique and Nestor are propping Anselma's leg up on pillows in the back of Mercedes' old station wagon-- 
MERCEDES Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see! 
ENRIQUE Donde vamos? [Where are we going?] 
MERCEDES A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it. 
ENRIQUE Senora, anything it costs, I can work-- 
MERCEDES Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors. 
Enrique turns to ANSELMA still frightened in the rear of the station wagon-- 
ENRIQUE Seas tranquila, mija. (Nods to Mercedes) Estamos en las manos de Senora Cruz. [Just relax, honey. We're in the hands of Senora Cruz.] 
Mercedes starts the car-- 
MERCEDES In English, Enrique. In English-- 
INT. DEL'S HOUSE -- DINING  ROOM 
Del steps in. Chet sits at the table, drawing a cartoon in panels. Del looks over his shoulder for a moment-- 
CARTOON 
A tank rolling over barbed wire, cannon and machine gun blasting away-- 
DEL (O.S.) Homework? 
DEL AND CHET 
CHET I finished that. I'm just messing around. 
DEL Tanks, huh? 
CHET You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive. 
DEL So you're going into the Army? 
Chet looks at him, not in a good mood, then goes back to his drawing-- 
CHET That's the general plan, isn't it? 
Del watches for a long moment, thinking-- 
DEL (Softly) That's up to you. 
Chet looks at his father again. All this is news to him-- 
DEL The Army isn't for everybody. 
Chet can't quite believe he is hearing this. Del crosses to the refrigerator-- 
DEL Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.

DAD (to the DR. PARNASSUS, threateningly) Oy! 
PARNASSUS ignores him and resumes his trance. 
Unnoticed by all, DIEGO has somehow managed to climb onto the stage and is peering at the mirror. 
MUM (looking around) Diego!? Where's Diego? 
DAD DIEGO!? 
VALENTINA turns her head just in time to see DIEGO vanish through the mirror. 
She starts to go after him, then hesitates. 
VALENTINA (trying to get ANTON'S attention) Pssst! 
ANTON looks across the stage to her. She mimes that a certain someone has gone into the mirror. ANTON considers waking DOCTOR PARNASSUS but thinks better of it. Instead he heads off upstage and through the mirror in pursuit of Diego. VALENTINA takes over the pitch. 
VALENTINA (CONT'D) Ladies and Gentlemen, let Dr. Parnassus be your guide... 
11   INT/EXT   MAGICAL LANDSCAPE                                 11 
ANTON moves through the cut -out trees and into a fantastic, brightly coloured landscape of Dr. Seuss-like hills and valleys. The sky if full of cloud-sized soap bubbles. 
Diego is in the distant using his game controller to make the bubbles bang into each other...trying to burst them. 
We can hear VALENTINA trying to continue the pitch in the face of the family from hell. Their baby has now started wailing. 
Cracks in the ground begin to appear under ANTON"S feet.

VALENTINA (V.O.) Beauty, Truth, Wisdom, Justice... without imagination all are dead. 
MUM (V.O.) DIEGO!!! 
DAD (V.O.) DIEGO!!! 
LINDA (V.O.) DEGSY! 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) OH FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! SHUT UP! 
The landscape, in response to DR. PARNASSUS' rage suddenly rips apart, fragmenting and spinning with ANTON inside it. 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) (enraged) AAAHHHH!!! DAMN AND BLAST!!! 
Things fly in all directions. 
12   INT/EXT   MAGICAL LANDSCAPE                                   12 
ANTON, recovering, struggles out from between giant blocks of stone. The world has gone dark. 
He hears DIEGO crying somewhere in the distance and starts to clamber over the shattered monoliths.. 
Reaching the top, ANTON sees DIEGO on the peak of a distant rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms. There are what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on either side of the pinnacle. 
CUT TO DIEGO who is in a state of confusion and terror. Is he lost inside a video game he can't control? He presses the buttons on his gaming device - to no avail. 
One of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under way... all very video-game-like. Thrilling aggressive music blares forth. 
MR NICK appears, still in red waist-coat and bowler hat, but this time in the form of a CUT-OUT shooting target with a bull's-eye on his chest. 
(CONTINUED) 
12   CONTINUED:                                                12 
MR NICK Come on laddy, cross the bridge! Join up! Be a man. Kill the enemy. Impress your dad. Unlimited ammo. Great fun. Pow! Pow! Pow! 
As he speaks bullets fly. Each time MR.NICK gets shot and is knocked flat, he pops back up continuing his spiel. 
The other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano keys and looks very rickety and unsafe. The piano key bridge descends into a great cavern where hundreds of BOY AND GIRL PIANISTS are practising on hundreds of pianos, all playing the same tune - the tune DR. PARNASSUS is humming, but with stern, demanding, PIANO TEACHERS in attendance. 
PIANO TEACHERS No, no, start again! Again! From the top! Again! Practice! Practice! 
DIEGO doesn't know what to do. 
Behind him rises a strange Mongolfier balloon. DR. PARNASSUS's face is repeated again and again around its circumference. ANTON'S in the basket. 
DIEGO catches sight of ANTON. 
DIEGO Help! (indicating gaming device) It doesn't work! It's broken! 
ANTON What? 
DIEGO The game! 
ANTON What g-g-game? 
DIEGO The game! The video game! The one we're in! 
ANTON I d-d-don't know what you're t-t- talking about. 
The INSPECTOR OF FAIRS is joined by a POLICEMAN and POLICEWOMAN. 
POLICEMAN What's the trouble? 
DR. PARNASSUS Ah, the fuzz. 
POLICEMAN What did you say? 
DR. PARNASSUS (charmingly) Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear, Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair, Fuzzy Wuzzy wasn't fuzzy wuzzy? 
The POLICE and the INSPECTOR exchange dark looks. Clearly they're dealing with a dangerous trouble-maker. 
INSPECTOR (to Parnassus) Next time I find you doing business without a permit I'll impound your wagon. 
POLICEMAN (to Parnassus) I'll be doing worse than that...now, bugger off! 
DR. PARNASSUS With pleasure. 
He bows mock graciously. 
14   INT   BACK STAGE   DRESSING ROOM   A MOMENT LATER           14 
Valentina, half-undressed, is struggling out of her `Wisdom' costume while at the same time looking at pictures of beautiful homes and gardens in a very battered copy of `Homes and Gardens'. Without make-up and costume she appears much younger.

14   CONTINUED:                                                  14 
A movement of something reflected in the dressing-room mirror catches her eye. 
In the mirror we see MR NICK, not a CUT-OUT, but the real thing. 
VALENTINA (startled, guiltily hiding `Homes and Gardens') Oh! 
She turns, holding her dress to cover her modesty. There's nobody there. 
VALENTINA (CONT'D) Who's that? Who's there? 
15   EXT   EDGE OF FAIR / THE WAGON       CONTINUOUS              15 
ANTON and PERCY are packing-up and closing the wagon. 
DR. PARNASSUS, out of his make-up and costume, is smiling and humming to himself as he removes the feed bag from one of the horses. 
The horse lifts its head and DR PARNASSUS recoils in shock and horror. Standing directly behind the horse is MR. NICK... a huge grin splitting his face. 
MR NICK Hello Parnassus... It's been a while hasn't it? 
PERCY, winding a rope onto a cleat, hears distant laughter and looks up. 
CUT TO PERCY'S P.O.V. where we see, some distance away and in a relatively secluded spot, MR NICK rocking with laughter while DOCTOR PARNASSUS looks stricken. He clutches at the back of a park bench to steady himself. 
CUT TO PERCY who looks thoughtful and worried. He heads off to help DOCTOR PARNASSUS as the latter slumps onto the bench. MR NICK has vanished. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (distraught) He's come to collect. 
PERCY I thought so.

DR. PARNASSUS What can I do?... 
PERCY (grimly) Nothing. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS There must be something! 
He looks over to where VALENTINA is helping close the theatre. PERCY follows his gaze. 
PERCY You're going to have to tell her. 
16   EXT   CITY STREETS      LATER                             16 
The wagon makes its way through city streets. 
PERCY is sitting on the roof driving. ANTON is lying on the roof looking up at the stars. VALENTINA is sitting next to him lost in thought. 
ANTON Look at that moon. (no response from Valentina) I've n-never seen it so b-big. And the stars...It's so c-clear. 
PERCY holds his hand out, palm up. 
PERCY (sardonically) Rain. 
ANTON (sotto voce) Valentina? 
VALENTINA (irritated) Val... Val. 
ANTON I c-c-can't call you Val, P- Parnassus d-doesn't like it.

VALENTINA He's not here is he? He's inside getting pissed. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (startled) Valentina... 
She comes in. 
VALENTINA I go to all this trouble and you leave it. 
DR. PARNASSUS I'm not hungry. 
VALENTINA Are you ill? 
DR. PARNASSUS (anguished) Valentina... my miraculous child.. I have something to tell you. 
VALENTINA Now what? 
She starts tidying up. 
DR. PARNASSUS (avoiding the question) I should never have brought you into this rotten bloody world! 
VALENTINA (she's heard this before) Oh for God's sake! 
DR. PARNASSUS What was I thinking of! 
VALENTINA Percy liked the soup. 
DR. PARNASSUS (agitated) Why does everybody want to live forever?

VALENTINA That's normal isn't it? 
DR. PARNASSUS Immortality's a curse! Any fool can tell you that! 
Valentina picks up Parnassus' nearly empty bottle. 
VALENTINA You know it doesn't agree with you. 
DR. PARNASSUS (in difficulty) Valentina... 
VALENTINA (losing patience) And I'll be sixteen on Thursday, so let's not have any more tosh about that. 
DR. PARNASSUS Listen to me! 
VALENTINA You think you're so clever and that everybody else is an idiot! You can't stop me growing up just by lying about my birthday! It's ridiculous! 
DR. PARNASSUS Shut up! Shut up and listen to me! Listen to me! I need to tell you something, before it's too late! 
DR PARNASSUS reaches up and plucks a glass paperweight out of the air. It's that kind that contains little models which are engulfed in a snow storm when the paperweight is shaken. 
DR. PARNASSUS shakes the paper-weight and watches the `snow' swirl about. 
DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D) One dark winter's night... Many years ago...? 
VALENTINA Is this going to take long?

THE CAMERA closes in on and `enters' the paperweight. 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) (CONT'D) Many centuries ago, as a matter of fact... 
18   EXT   INSIDE THE PAPERWEIGHT    NIGHT                        18 
A HOODED RIDER moves slowly through the snowstorm, the horse picking its way carefully across a field of virgin snow. 
DR. PARNASSUS (V.O.) ... I was visited... by someone I had hoped never to meet. 
In the distance, rising like a dark mountain, is a strange monastery. Dim light comes from a couple of windows. 
We can hear, from far away, the indistinct droning voice of the story teller, a younger DR. PARNASSUS. 
THE CAMERA moves up over and way ahead of the HOODED RIDER, continuing through the snowstorm, over fields, forests, valleys, rocks, until it reaches the monastery, high on a rugged hill. Here it enters one of the dimly lit monastery windows, taking us into a dining hall. 
19   INT   MONASTERY DINING HALL    NIGHT                         19 
Entering via a window and looking down into the monastery dining hall, we see DOZENS OF MONKS sitting at a long refectory table. They are eating their supper and listening to a young DR. PARNASSUS who is sitting on a dais at the far end of the hall, his eyes closed, in a trance, telling a story. 
A log fire burns in a big fireplace. 
DR. PARNASSUS ... Having captured the wind and tamed the storm ... the Chief Steward, laying down to take his rest, had a disturbing dream... He dreamt that a hooded rider was approaching across the snow-swept plain. (MORE)

The door to the refectory swings open with a crash. 
The MONKS look up. 
Standing on the thresh-hold is the hooded figure, covered with snow. 
The MAN appears to be dead but VALENTINA decides to try the kiss of life. 
ANTON is made uncomfortable seeing VALENTINA administer the kiss of life and he pulls her away. 
ANTON No! That won't work. And anyway, you d-don't know where he's b-been. Let me... 
He brings both fists down hard on the centre of the MAN'S chest. 
Boing! The `dead' MAN coughs, sits bolt upright, spits out a little metal tube and smashes his head on the underside of the wagon, knocking himself out. 
The little metal tube clatters over the asphalt. 
ANTON (CONT'D) He's alive! 
VALENTINA Thank God. 
PERCY Well, he was. 
ANTON picks up the little metal tube and examines it. 
ANTON What on earth is this? 
29   EXT   BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE        REAR OF WAGON MOMENTS LATER   29 
VALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY drag the MAN from under the wagon and carry him to the rear. 
VALENTINA Put him in the big trunk. 
ANTON B-but... 
VALENTINA Don't argue. 
PERCY The boss said leave him.

VALENTINA He thought he was dead. 
They start to bundle the MAN in one of the travelling trunks attached to the back of the wagon. With the body hanging half in half out, ANTON suddenly stops. 
ANTON I d-don't like it. It's none of our b-business. 
VALENTINA So, what do you suggest, we leave him on the side of the road? 
ANTON doesn't want to answer that one. 
PERCY (walking away) Definitely. 
VALENTINA, single-handedly, hefts the MAN into the trunk and carefully places a cushion under his head. An action not missed by ANTON. 
30   EXT   DERELICT BUILDINGS       DAWN                         30 
The wagon stands, hidden, among deserted derelict buildings. All is quiet. 
The lid of the big travelling trunk slowly opens. 
The MAN struggles out. His neck is sore, his wrists ache and his head is bruised. He hasn't a clue where he is. He tries to make sense of the wagon, the grazing horses, the derelict buildings. 
Some distance away a bizarre, horned and tailed CREATURE is involved in a strange contorted dance. 
Hoping to avoid the CREATURE, the MAN starts to move away but is stopped by a squeaky voice behind him. 
PERCY (V.O.) Hey, you! 
The MAN turns around to find PERCY looking at him. 
PERCY (CONT'D) I suppose somebody saves your life everyday of the week.

MAN (croaking) What? 
He can hardly speak. It hurts him to do so. 
PERCY Too much like routine to bother with a thank you. 
MAN (with difficulty) Who are you? 
PERCY Percival St. Antoine della Touraine et Sansepolcro da Piemonte the Third. If that proves too difficult, you may call me Percy. 
MAN Where are we? 
PERCY Geographically, in the Northern Hemisphere. Socially, on the margins. Narratively, with some way to go. And your name is... 
MAN (appalled) I... I can't remember. 
PERCY That's handy. 
PERCY whistles to the dancing CREATURE, who turns and approaches. The MAN is getting very nervous. 
PERCY (CONT'D) Any credit cards? 
MAN (puzzled) Marks? 
The MAN wipes his hand across his forehead. Looks at his inky hand.. confused. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (sotto voce) You've been sent by Mr Nick. 
MAN (puzzled) Mr Nick? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (impassioned) Don't toy with me. Tell me you're an emissary from Mr Nick. (MORE)

TONY doesn't know what DR PARNASSUS in talking about but he grasps the fact that if he wants to be allowed to stay here he needs to play along. 
MAN Yes. 
DR. PARNASSUS Thank God! Thank God! Thank God for that! 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS takes PERCY aside, shows him the Hanged Man Tarot Card and indicates the MAN with a nod. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS He's from Mr Nick. 
PERCY No he's not. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS He's come with a proposal. 
PERCY No he hasn't. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS All is not lost. 
PERCY What proposal? 
VALENTINA Father? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (looking at the card, then to the MAN) You're welcome. 
MAN (croaking) Thank you. 
PERCY groans and tears his hair. 
VALENTINA is pleased. ANTON is not. 
VALENTINA kisses PARNASSUS on the cheek. 
31   INT     DOCTOR PARNASSUS' DEN     A LITTLE LATER          31 
The MAN precedes DOCTOR PARNASSUS in the tiny room. He looks around in amazement. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS We can talk here. Sit down, sit down. 
MAN Thank you. 
He does so. DOCTOR PARNASSUS sits opposite him. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (expectantly) So... 
PAUSE 
MAN (trying to look on top of it) I like your study. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS The message. 
MAN (cautiously) The message? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS The message! What's the message? From Mr Nick. What does he want? 
MAN Ah... Well... That's the problem... 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Problem? What problem?

32   EXT   SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT    NIGHT                     32 
The wagon is parked in a shopping mall parking lot. The theatre is being opened up by PERCY and ANTON. There are a few late night SHOPPERS coming and going. 
VALENTINA peers out over the `footlights' in the hope of catching sight of GEORGE. 
VALENTINA Where's George? 
He's nowhere in sight. 
ANTON (sarcastically) P-probably remembered he had a wife or t-two back in Russia. 
VALENTINA gives him a dirty look. 
36   INT   SHOPPING MALL SUPERMARKET     THAT MOMENT              36 
GEORGE, wearing his `romantic' Venice carnival mask is smooth- talking several middle-aged LADIES on queue at the supermarket check-out. 
He's carrying the theatre's ticket dispenser. 
GEORGE Three tickets for the price of two... That's a fantastic deal. It's a brilliant show. Much better than sex. 
Much ribald laughter from the flattered LADIES. 
37   EXT   SHOPPING MALL PARKING LOT   LATER                      37 
The shoppers have gone. The last car drives out of the car park leaving it empty except for the theatre wagon. 
ANTON, VALENTINA and PERCY are on their own. 
PARNASSUS, on his plinth, is asleep and snoring. 
ANTON Thank G-God... N-not a single customer! 
PERCY Let's close up quick while the going's good. 
VALENTINA (amazed) He's never not done a show before... Maybe he's past it. (hopefully) Maybe it's time to retire. 
PARNASSUS groans in his sleep. 
ANTON (looking out front) Oh n-no! 
ANTON sees GEORGE heading towards them with a mob of MIDDLE- AGED WOMEN in tow. 
Bubbling with excitement, the mob arrives.

EVELYN Oh look! How fascinating. 
The other WOMEN agree. 
EVELYN (CONT'D) (looking at her watch) When does the next show start? 
PERCY There isn't a next show. 
EVELYN and the other WOMEN are puzzled. 
PERCY (CONT'D) We've done all the shows we're doing here this evening. 
DEIDRE But we've got tickets. 
GEORGE looks hopefully at VALENTINA and ANTON who don't know what to say. 
We hear a crash. 
THE CAMERA PANS around. PARNASSUS has fallen off his perch and is now lying on the floor...snoring and mumbling. 
VALENTINA and some of the WOMEN run forward. 
SYLVIA This man's drunk. Dead drunk. 
EVELYN Disgraceful. 
VALENTINA O/S (suddenly defensive of her father) He's not drunk. He's got a bad cold.... 
GEORGE But being a true professional he tried to keep going, at considerable risk to his health. 
VALENTINA and GEORGE exchange a quick look. VALENTINA thinks she's found a kindred spirit.

GEORGE No problem...dear ladies. No problem at all. I'm so terribly sorry. I can't apologize enough. You can have your money back or, if you like... an extra free ticket. Better yet, two extra free tickets if you buy another ticket at half price. This offer is only available today. 
The WOMEN look on the verge of taking up the offer. 
ANTON and PERCY exchange looks. They can't believe GEORGE'S chutzpah.

VALENTINA sits at a mirror fussing with various hair styles - slyly trying to catch GEORGE's attention. 
PARNASSUS, holding his aching head, sits a short distance away sadly watching her. PERCY is with him. 
PERCY Five souls.. two days, eh!? 
DR. PARNASSUS Shh! I'm trying to think. 
PERCY I told you didn't I? 
DR. PARNASSUS What?

PERCY No... but they sure as hell like being economical with the truth. 
CUT TO ANTON who is painting a long-stemmed, wooden flower...he comes over to VALENTINA with it in his hand. 
VALENTINA (looking away) Don't talk to me. 
ANTON P-please...I'm sorry about last night. I behaved like an idiot. 
VALENTINA Yes. 
ANTON suddenly plops down on his arse in a puddle of mud. Then spins, flips the flower high into the air and, rolling face down onto his stomach, catches the stem with his clenched buttocks. VALENTINA bursts out laughing. 
ANTON You must admit... even idiots have their qualities. 
CUT TO GEORGE who is peeling potatoes, badly. PARNASSUS and PERCY come up behind him. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS George... We'd like to know who you really are. 
GEORGE What?... Yes. Me too. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS I may be able to help. 
GEORGE Really? What?... How...? 
PERCY produces a small contraption with wires from behind his back and gives it to DR PARNASSUS.

PERCY You won't feel a thing. 
GEORGE takes the end of the wire. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS I'm going to put the tips of my fingers on the top of your head. 
He does so. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) I want you to relax and try as far as possible to think of nothing. 
GEORGE That's not difficult... in my condition. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS closes his eyes. He seems to be making an effort. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Hold your breath. 
GEORGE does so. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) Very good, very good. Yes... Yes, I see... I see... Very interesting. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS takes his hand from GEORGE'S head and gives the contraption back to PERCY. 
PERCY You may breathe normally. 
The effort seems to have tired PARNASSUS. He needs to sit down. 
GEORGE What... ? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Alas, this technique has its limitations. 
GEORGE But... Did you discover anything?

DR. PARNASSUS The little snake! I'll skin him alive! 
CUT TO ANTON who winces. 
PERCY While you're at it, don't forget the other one. 
DR. PARNASSUS looks at PERCY questioningly.

DR. PARNASSUS I think he might. Valentina sees good in him. 
PERCY She'd be better off with Anton. 
CUT TO ANTON who's pleased. 
DR. PARNASSUS Perhaps I should offer her hand to whoever helps most in winning the next five souls. 
CUT TO ANTON who looks puzzled. 
PERCY That's even worse than the other ideas you've had today.

ANTON, as Mercury, is doing his pitch. 
ANTON Sleep no more. Procrastinate no longer. Embrace this once in a life- time opportunity. Let the mind of Doctor Parnassus be the portal to the infinite world of your imagination. 
Behind the curtain, PERCY is signalling VALENTINA to see if DOCTOR PARNASSUS has been drinking. She sniffs him. 
(CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED:                                                  44 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS What are you doing? Please concentrate. We've got a tremendous amount of work to do tonight. A great deal depends on it. 
A roll on the drums from PERCY. The curtain rises. DOCTOR PARNASSUS `floats' above the stage on his glass plinth. 
ANTON As old as the universe itself, the great Doctor, versed in every mystic practice known to man, and many more besides, will guide you to your destiny. 
However, the AUDIENCE - a few PASSERS-BY and DRINKERS who have drifted out of the pub for a smoke - aren't much interested in ANTON. Instead they pay more attention to the masked TONY who, decked out in a stylish costume, is working the sparse crowd with his smooth charm. 
ANTON, irritated, glances back at DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is worried about the lack of customers. 
TONY is now surrounded by fascinated WOMEN. They laugh at one of his jokes. One pretty young woman, SALLY, in particular seems to be smitten by the handsome `actor'. TONY smiles seductively at her. 
The sight provokes ANTON. He leaps off the stage, grabs SALLY by the wrist and begins to pull her to the stage. 
PERCY keeps playing. 
SALLY (laughing) What?... Hey, what you doing? 
ANTON T-taking you to the heart of your imagination! 
ANTON is trying to compete with TONY but just can't manage the charm. 
SALLY (good humoured) Oh my god! No way! 
ANTON You won't regret it! 
(CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED: (2)                                       44 
FEMALE FRIEND Go for it Sal! 
SALLY (indicating friend) Only if she comes with me. 
FEMALE FRIEND (enthusiastic) Now you're talking! 
(CONTINUED) 
46   CONTINUED:                                                  46 
PERCY, desperate, produces a pistol and fires a couple of shots into the air. 
EVERYONE dives for cover. 
PERCY, taking advantage of the temporary lull, begins to race around, untying, unhooking, and pulling on ropes. 
The theatre begins to close up as the horses bolt and the wagon clatters off down the street, bits falling off as it goes. 
VOICE IN CROWD Somebody call the police! 
A battered TONY, chased by the enraged crowd,just manages to clamber on board, with the help of VALENTINA. 
The wagon narrowly succeeds in out-pacing the fastest of the CROWD. As it disappears down the street, a figure is dumped unceremoniously out through the back door of the wagon. 
It's the terrified SALLY, sent sprawling in the middle of the road. 
A figure steps out from the shadows to help her to her feet. It's MR. NICK in his bowler and red waistcoat. 
47   EXT.   RUBBISH TIP      NIGHT                                47 
A police siren howls as the wagon comes crashing around the corner of a great rubbish tip and clatters to a halt... the horses steaming, sections of the theatre hanging loose, broken..an utter mess. The siren fades into the distance. 
48   INT/EXT   THEATRE/WAGON      NIGHT                           48 
Amongst collapsed scenery PARNASSUS lies in a heap. The others are struggling to their feet. ANTON is desperately trying to do something useful to help PARNASSUS but, VALENTINA pushes him out of the way. 
VALENTINA What were you thinking? Look what you've done. Get out of the way! (appealing to Tony) Tony. 
TONY, battered and bleeding, helps her lift PARNASSUS and manoeuvre him to his room. 
(CONTINUED) 
48   CONTINUED:                                                   48 
ANTON is mortified.      PERCY pats him on the back. 
PERCY Better luck next time. 
49   INT    PARNASSUS' ROOM    NIGHT                               49 
TONY helps VALENTINA get PARNASSUS comfortable. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (babbling) This is my punishment. All is lost. First to Five. One down. Impossible, Valentina. First to five. One down. No people. No time, Valentina. We are doomed. 
VALENTINA (very concerned) Ssshhhh... Thanks, Tony. Leave us. 
TONY, nods, leaves slowly. Listening. 
50   EXT.    WAGON    NIGHT                                        50 
PERCY is angrily banging about, trying to repair the damage. ANTON is trying to help but, is just getting in the way. 
PERCY Do me a favour. Take a long walk off a short pier. 
TONY arrives. 
TONY Can I help? 
PERCY Bugger off! 
TONY finds ANTON sitting despondently a short way from the wagon swigging from a bottle. He sits down next to him. 
ANTON L-leave me alone. 
TONY What were you doing to that girl behind the mirror? 
(CONTINUED) 
50   CONTINUED:                                                50 
ANTON (incensed) What are you suggesting? 
TONY Oh, c'mon...we all heard her screaming. 
ANTON I was screaming as well.   It was t- terrifying... 
TONY Terrifying? Why? I don't understand. 
ANTON (reluctantly) No, well...you wouldn't. You've n- never been inside the D-Doctor's mind have you? 
TONY Your not trying to tell me that mind control stuff is real? 
ANTON You think it's some k-kind of scam, d-don't you? 
TONY Isn't it? 
ANTON No... But I d-don't expect you to g- get it... N-not in a million years. 
TONY Hang on.. if he can really control people's minds, why isn't he ruling the world? Why bother with this crappy side show? 
ANTON He d-doesn't want to rule the world d-does he?... He wants the world to rule itself! 
(CONTINUED) 
52   CONTINUED: (3)                                            52 
TONY The trick is not to hide. Change your colours. Be bold. Go where they would least expect to find you. I think we have been brought together for a reason. I don't believe in coincidence. You saved my life. Now let me do something in return. 
PARNASSUS confers with PERCY. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Our time's nearly up... This could be what we need. 
TONY (to Valentina) This can be my birthday gift to Valentina. 
VALENTINA smiles and nods to PARNASSUS. 
DR. PARNASSUS Well then... (with a burst of energy) For God's sake let's do it!!! 
PERCY (sighs) Yeah, okay, but what exactly do we do? 
TONY Well... First of all, I want you to give me your money. All of it. 
What?!   PARNASSUS, PERCY, and VALENTINA look at each other. 
Then PARNASSUS sees something beyond the wagon...ANTON, downcast, heading off through the swirling plastic bags and flying rubbish... a battered suitcase in his hand. 
DR. PARNASSUS Anton!   Where are you going? 
No answer from ANTON. 
VALENTINA runs after him but, he marches on silently. 
(CONTINUED) 
52   CONTINUED: (4)                                              52 
VALENTINA What are you doing? Didn't you do enough damage last night? (pummmelling his back) Anton... I'm the one who wants to run away! (he slows) Are you trying to wreck my birthday, or what? 
Anton stops, still not looking at VALENTINA he slowly drops his suitcase. 
VALENTINA (CONT'D) Please. We need you. 
Moved, ANTON turns to her.   She smiles sweetly. 
VALENTINA (CONT'D) How much money have you got? 
53   EXT   BOND STREET   EVENING                                  53 
Close up on Parnassus's glass plinth..now open-topped and sitting on the edge of the stage... full of the troupe's savings. A sign proclaims "Please Take Generously" 
Directly behind the glass box is a half-globe with the continent of Africa featured. Sitting on top is Percy playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one hand...his other is held out pathetically... a beggar. He's blacked up and dressed in rags. He doesn't look happy. He sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money. 
The wagon, newly painted in sleek and stylish black and white, stands in Bond Street or some similarly fashionable street with expensive shops and art galleries. RICH WOMEN anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth glide past. 
New signs proclaim `The Choice Is Yours' `The Imaginarium - More Exclusive than ever'. 
The stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been chromatically divided in half - one side black, the other white. 
On the dark side a bloated, sun-glassed woman consuming vast quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge. She is, in fact, a very uncomfortable ANTON in full and fulsome drag. 
(CONTINUED) 
53   CONTINUED:                                                    53 
Center stage stands DR. PARNASSUS dressed as a stylized doctor with head reflector. In his hand is a staff with an elaborate sun on the top. He is blindfolded. 
On the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples. Under the tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits VALENTINA as Eve...naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty. She gracefully combs her hair. 
Above the mirror is a sign proclaiming "The Naked Truth". 
DR. PARNASSUS, peeking under his blindfold, is distinctly uncomfortable by his daughter's lack of attire. 
TONY, in a beautifully cut white suit, and wearing his `romantic' Venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy pose on the edge of the white side of the stage. 
Nobody speaks. They pay no attention to the crowd. 
A few women stop, curious. One of them takes out some money and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go. 
TONY (retrieving the money) Excuse me, madam. I'm afraid we can't accept this. 
The woman stops, confused. Tony hands her back her money. 
TONY (CONT'D) We are here to give...not take. We are here to help those in need. If it's money you need, then here it is. (referring to the glass plinth) If it's the flowering of the soul you need, then here we are but, unfortunately we are booked solid at the moment. But thank you.. I can see you have a generous spirit. 
TONY returns to his pensive pose.    The women look at each other. 
WOMAN Excuse me but, how does this work? What does it cost? 
(CONTINUED) 
53   CONTINUED: (2)                                           53 
TONY Cost? Money is no good in the Imaginarium.   This is a refuge for hearts in need of truth. A place for souls to be purified. 
WOMAN 2 How long does that take?   I'm running late. 
TONY Madam, why should you care about time? What are your dreams worth in minutes? 
THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN pouts playfully, pulling him onwards. 
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN Why would I want to go without you darling? 
TONY It's one of the rules... One imagination at a time, free from the influence of another. 
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (petulant) Boring. 
(CONTINUED) 
54   CONTINUED: (2)                                              54 
They have reached the bridge. Stairs descend to a stream. 
TONY Oh..look... another possibility.. 
Below them a gondola rests in the stream as small, flower bedecked barques float past with framed pictures of romantic heroes who died young; Keats, Shelly, Byron, James Dean, Rudolph Valentino, Marilyn Monroe, Buddy Holly, Princess Diana... the stream continues off into the distance to a dark, towering Egyptian pyramid. 
TONY is as bemused as THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN. 
TONY (CONT'D) You must make a choice...and... actually, to be honest, I'd strongly recommend this one. 
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN But... Rudolph Valentino, James Dean, Princess Di?... all these people... they're dead. 
TONY (thinking fast) Exactly. To be reborn, first you must die. All of them have achieved a kind of immortality. And we love them all the more for it. They won't get old or fat. They won't get sick or feeble. They are beyond fear. They are forever young. They are gods. And you can join them. 
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN (softening) You're such a wonderful speaker. 
The gondola awaits....with a beautiful male model at the helm. THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN smiles at him. 
TONY There's not a moment to lose. 
But as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them. TONY, looking past the WOMAN"S shoulder, sees the dark waters of the stream rise up transforming into a GIGANTIC KING COBRA that towers menacingly over them. It's wearing a BOWLER HAT... and it's angry. 
(CONTINUED) 
54   CONTINUED: (3)                                           54 
TONY (CONT'D) But your sacrifice must be pure. You have to let go of all these worldly goods. 
He helps THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN remove her necklace, earrings, bracelets, rings, broach, in double quick time and guides her onto the gondola, blowing a kiss after her. 
TONY (CONT'D) Remember nothing is permanent... not even death. 
He turns back to see the GIGANTIC KING COBRA shrinking back below the bridge, transforming itself back into the waters of the stream. From under the arch of the bridge hangs a rope. At its end.. a hangman's noose. 
TONY stares at it darkly disconcerted. 
55   EXT.   STAGE     EVENING                                  55 
TONY re-enters the stage through the mirror, looking at DR. PARNASSUS who has just come out of his trance with astonishment 
TONY (gobsmacked) That was so... I had no idea... It's just... incredible. 
...And then he realizes the clock is still striking the hour realizing that only a few moments have passed since he entered the mirror. 
TONY (CONT'D) ..how do you do this? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (ignoring him and with a big theatrical gesture) Hooplah! 
The LOUIS VUITTON woman reappears, sitting on a cut-out cloud descending from the ceiling of the stage. She looks radiant. 
She is weeping, completely overcome by her experience. PARNASSUS steps forward and helps her to her feet. She kisses his hands in gratitude. 
(CONTINUED) 
55   CONTINUED:                                                  55 
LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN Thank you, thank you, that was so beautiful, I feel so... thank you so much... 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (graciously) Thank YOU, dear Lady, you give me strength to continue 
Born again, tearful but transcendent, the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN produces her cheque book and begins to write a cheque. 
TONY is frozen, confused. The crowd is still... stunned by the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN's transformation as she deposits the cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box and glides benignly through the crowd... which parts in awe. 
Pause... and then the other WOMEN rush the stage. Mayhem is narrowly averted as TONY and PERCY manage to coral them into a more-or-less orderly queue. 
Across the street, standing in the doorway of a shop selling luxury goods, is MR NICK. He watches events, intrigued... 
...as TONY escorts a second woman through the mirror, and a third, they descend, ecstatic, emptying the contents of their handbags, their pearls, earrings and diamond rings into the glass box. 
TONY pays off the cops who move on. 
TONY, getting more and more flamboyant, forgets to lower his mask each time he re-enters the stage. And now a fourth woman descends. Four successes for DOCTOR PARNASSUS. 
DR. PARNASSUS (aside to Percy) One more to go and we're free. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS spots MR NICK across the street, smiles, holds up four fingers. 
MR NICK gives a little `I'm not impressed' smirk and turns away and pretends to be interested in the luxury goods in the shop window as four large dark heavy RUSSIAN MEN, all laden with luxury shopping walk past. 
One of the RUSSIANS stops..looking at the show..at TONY whose mask is sitting on top of his head. The leading RUSSIAN pulls him on. 
(CONTINUED) 
ANTON Stop it! L-leave him alone! 
(CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED: (3)                                              56 
The RUSSIANS turn and, thinking ANTON is a fat, bossy, middle- aged woman, hesitate. 
ANTON (CONT'D) Stand b-back! I'm warning you! 
Foolishly, he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial arts pose. The RUSSIANS look at each other. Then, utterly ignoring ANTON, turn their attention back to beating TONY. 
GREGOR walks calmly over to ANTON who is in attack mode. 
GREGOR (bending down and picking a flower, he offers it to ANTON) Relax. Smell the flowers. 
Confused, ANTON takes the flower, sniffs and then... GREGOR floors him with a powerful punch on the nose 
Meanwhile, the RUSSIANS have a noose around TONY's neck and have looped the rope over a tree branch. TONY struggles to pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck. He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when... 
... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves - revealing DR. PARNASSUS' carved and painted face beneath. 
The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a welcoming red carpet. From inside the giant mouth a smiling policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in.. 
The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope. 
TONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe flies out of his mouth. 
Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads "JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE".. and a chorus line of LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear - high-kicking a snappy song and dance number. 
The astonished RUSSIANS don't know what the fuck is going on. 
Suddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting something in Russian. 
Spinning around, the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russian grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to them. A stunned pause. Then, pell-mell, they rush to her. 
(CONTINUED) 
56   CONTINUED: (4)                                             56 
RUSSIANS (IN RUSSIAN) Mama!   Mama! Help! Save us! 
As they run toward her they get smaller and smaller. She lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath. And then.. BOOM!.. a muffled explosion balloons the skirts outward. Smoke spews out from below. 
Straightening her skirt, the BABOUSHKA looks up, and pulls off her head - revealing MR.NICK's tiny head poking out of the collar. He smiles smugly. 
The giant POLICEMAN DR. PARNASSUS registers disappointment and, like a balloon rapidly deflating, spins off into the sky sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything. 
The dust clears and TONY and ANTON find themselves in a desolate, empty landscape. Nowhere. Nothing. 
TONY Did you see me!! I almost reached the clouds! I could have...it was incredible...I was almost there... 
ANTON Shut up! 
Over a distant rise the wagon appears, pulled by the horses. ANTON drags Tony, babbling and stumbling, towards it. 
TONY I made my choice and I climbed... I felt so much potential. I could have done anything. I have to have another chance...another go...I need this... 
57   EXT   SOMEWHERE DOWN RIVER - MUD FLATS   EVENING             57 
The wagon is parked on waste ground. It looms out of nowhere illuminated by a light leaking from within. 
We hear PERCY'S angry voice. 
PERCY O/S Maybe you were holding them upside down. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS What? 
(CONTINUED) 
57   CONTINUED:                                                  57 
PERCY That cards! The bloody Tarot cards! 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S (distraught and angry) Enough, Percy! Enough! 
TONY O/S I made a mistake. A big mistake. I know that and I'm sorry. 
58   INT   THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS                                58 
The angry troupe huddles amongst the clutter of props and jumbled scenery. TONY is on trial. 
DR. PARNASSUS is sitting in a corner, head in hands. He seems utterly destroyed. 
ANTON You're a l-liar. You've been lying to us all along. Who are you? Who were those thugs? 
TONY I am not a liar! 
ANTON No? 
TONY No! I just... didn't divulge everything I knew. 
PERCY Comes to the same thing. 
TONY Absolutely not. Not in law. 
The horses are standing steaming nearby. 
DR. PARNASSUS (very down) I know... It's over....you've won... 
MR NICK Four rotten Russkies? 
DR. PARNASSUS And the girl..from the pub. 
MR NICK shakes his head. 
MR NICK Sally doesn't count.    Do you, gal? 
SALLY (the woman thrown out from the wagon as they escaped from the pub mob) steps out of the shadows, puts her arms around NICK 
DR. PARNASSUS You're joking... toying with me. Like a cat with a mouse... As is your privilege. 
MR NICK Sal didn't get to make a real choice. You were gaga. Out for the count. Wouldn't be fair...And you've got four, thanks to your friend Tony. So... we're even... it's not quite over. 
He smiles, lights a cigarette, takes a deep drag... 
MR NICK (CONT'D) Not quite. (checks his watch) Oh,oh, look at the time...it's 11. 
(CONTINUED) 
59   CONTINUED:                                               59 
...and he wanders off into the darkness with SALLY. Somewhere, a clock strikes 11. 
DR. PARNASSUS, agitated, watches him go. 
VALENTINA (V.O.) Father? 
DR. PARNASSUS looks round to find VALENTINA standing next to him. He starts to round up the horses. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Valentina... my darling girl. We must do another show! Now! Quickly! Get ready to move out! 
VALENTINA Who was that? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Somebody asking the way. Where's Tony? 
VALENTINA I overheard you... He wasn't asking the way. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Please! Get everybody together. Another show! Tony! Percy! 
VALENTINA I want to know what's going on. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (harnessing the horses) Not now. 
VALENTINA Yes, now! I want to know the truth! 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS The truth? 
VALENTINA What are you hiding? 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS There are more important things, at this moment! 
(CONTINUED) 
59   CONTINUED: (2)                                           59 
VALENTINA It's something to do with that bloody rambling story you were telling me the night we found Tony isn't it? 
PARNASSUS sighs. Stops. He checks his watch 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Yes. 
VALENTINA So tell me. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS What I told you was... the truth. I really am thousands of years old. I have been immortal. I have been mortal. And I have had many dealings with the devil. Too many. 
VALENTINA (fearful) What are you saying?... 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Remember the woman I was telling you about?.. the one I was so desperately in love with.. so in love that I made a deal with the devil? That was your mother... ...she was so beautiful, so enchanting...so... 
Looking at VALENTINA, DR. PARNASSUS sees her morph into the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN appearing. He almost swoons. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) ... so young. She was everything I had ever dreamed of. I made a choice. I bargained away my immortality. I regained my youth... and I won her. I did! I won her...! 
The BEAUTIFUL WOMAN morphs back into VALENTINA. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) ...but at a price... 
DR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and loses his balance. 
(CONTINUED) 
59   CONTINUED: (3)                                       59 
VALENTINA stops him from falling. 
VALENTINA What price? 
DR. PARNASSUS (anguished) It's too terrible... 
VALENTINA Tell me... 
Tony steers DOCTOR PARNASSUS towards his glass column. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS Yes! Yes! Of course! Of course! Thank God! Thank God! 
TONY (to himself) How about thanking me? 
DR. PARNASSUS What? 
TONY I expect nothing in return. 
DR. PARNASSUS (trying to go into a trance) No. You're a saint... A saint. 
TONY Only Valentina's hand in marriage, if she'll have me... 
DR. PARNASSUS (not listening) Oh, my head... 
TONY And, as your son-in-law... perhaps... initiation into the secrets of the trance. 
DR. PARNASSUS No! I can't do it! 
(CONTINUED) 
62   CONTINUED: (2)                                             62 
TONY But... (realizing Parnassus is referring to his inability to go into a trance) Why not?! What's wrong? 
DR. PARNASSUS My mind... I can't concentrate... I'm too upset... 
TONY You must do it! You have to do it! It's the only way to save your daughter! 
DR. PARNASSUS (distraught) I know... 
TONY (sitting PARNASSUS down) Concentrate. You must concentrate. (clearing the way to the mirror) I'll make the right choice. I'm sure of it. I can feel how right it is already. 
TONY leaps back to steady DR. PARNASSUS who looked as though he were about to topple off his pillar. 
TONY (CONT'D) Oh God!... Doctor... We can save her.. you and me. I need this. We both need this. Please. The trance. 
PARNASSUS quiets down.   Starts mumbling. 
TONY rushes to the mirror. Steps through. He finds himself standing amongst the stage scenery. Nothing else. 
TONY (CONT'D) Bugger! 
He steps back out of the mirror.    Goes to PARNASSUS who is weeping. 
DR. PARNASSUS It's no good! 
(CONTINUED) 
62   CONTINUED: (3)                                           62 
TONY shakes him hard. 
TONY PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER!... Sir. Concentrate...or you'll have lost her forever. 
PARNASSUS slowly goes into a sobbing kind of trance state. 
TONY confirms he is in a trance, then rushes to the mirror. 
VALENTINA O/S Tony...oh, Tony.. 
What?! TONY stops. Looks around. There in the shadows huddles VALENTINA, sobbing. 
VALENTINA (sobbing) It's useless... Hopeless... I thought I was strong, but I don't even know how to run away... 
TONY hesitates.. No time! He looks back to PARNASSUS who seems to still be in his trance. Hesitates. Then rushes to VALENTINA. 
TONY It's alright... it's alright... Don't cry. It's going to be alright, believe me. 
VALENTINA This stupid theatre...!... That's all I've ever known...! I've always believed it was something precious, but it's not... it's a lie...I hate it! 
TONY lifts her up, putting his arm around her. 
TONY Everything's going to be alright... I'll take you away. I'll show you the world. My world. The great big beautiful world I've always dreamed of... You'll love it. 
VALENTINA, grateful, clings to TONY.

TONY (CONT'D) Yes? 
VALENTINA Maybe. 
TONY C'mon then. 
They turn to the mirror but, an off-stage clearing of the throat makes them look round to see ANTON watching them. He's holding a torn and dirty piece of newspaper. 
ANTON Ah, there you are, Tony. Here's something m-might interest you. (reading) 'Missing: D-disgraced head of children's charity'. 
TONY No! 
TONY tries to snatch the paper but ANTON steps back. 
TONY (CONT'D) (shouting angrily) Ostanobuite bas menshi schit! 
The litle girl goes quiet. VALENTINA looks at TONY with surprise. The BABOUSHKA looks angry. Suddenly a light begins to suffuse TONY and the little girl. A small orchestra can be heard playing garden party music. 
VALENTINA You did it! You made the right choice! 
The light fills the screen and we find... 
...TONY, sleekly groomed and immaculately dressed, holding the smiling little girl. She too has been cleaned and buffed. The sun shines. He stands in... 
64   EXT   CHARITY GARDEN PARTY     DAY                            64 
...a large well kept lawn covered with smart guests, BUSINESS PEOPLE, POLITICIANS, POP STARS, CELEBS... 
Behind and beyond them is an impressive country house. 
A small orchestra is playing. There is a marquee. 
WAITERS and WAITRESSES move amongst the assembled notables bearing trays of drinks and food. 
TONY is the focus of attention. A TV current-affairs/news JOURNALIST with CAMERA CREW is following him around.

TONY Sustainability's great, if you can achieve it. The problem is, in many cases you simply can't, for a whole variety of reasons. 
TONY smiles and shakes the hand of someone in a wheelchair. 
A GROUP OF GUESTS burst into spontaneous applause. Everybody loves and admires TONY. He smiles boyishly. 
He moves on. The TV CREW stay with him. 
JOURNALIST Aren't you running the risk of entrenching the need for charity by increasingly institutionalising it? 
TONY Look, charity, like poor little Olga... (referring to the little girl) ...is always with us, to coin a phrase... 
VALENTINA appears. She is beautifully dressed, coiffed, made- up, she looks stunning. 
TONY (CONT'D) (to VALENTINA) Ah, there you are, my lovely. 
She and TONY exchange broad smiles. They're in love. He pulls her to his side and puts his arm around her. The photographers snap away. 
JOURNALIST And what's your message to the Prime Minister? 
TONY (laughs engagingly) I wouldn't presume to have a 'message' for the Prime Minister... Fortunately for the Foundation, I think we pretty much see eye to eye on most things. 
Now we hear a distant buzzing. EVERYBODY looks up. 
(CONTINUED) 
64   CONTINUED: (2)                                           64 
They see a speck in the sky, it's the PRIME MINISTER'S approaching helicopter... 
TONY and the posse of JOURNALISTS and PHOTOGRAPHERS rush off leaving VALENTINA standing alone. 
65   EXT   HELICOPTER LANDING PAD DAY                             65 
The PRIME MINISTER and his WIFE get out of the helicopter, followed by their AIDES. TONY and the PRIME MINISTER shake hands for THE TV CAMERAS. 
VALENTINA watches from a distance..ignored. 
66   INT   BALLROOM   NIGHT                                       66 
A huge chandelier illuminates a grand ornate ballroom where wealthy guests, in evening dress, are being seated at tables by liveried ushers. Large beautiful photographs of the underprivileged children of the world line the walls. A great banner reads "Suffer The Little Children Benefit Ball" 
The PRIME MINISTER and his WIFE are seated at the head table, facing the dais, bubbly and expectant. Security is heavy. 
67   INT   ENTRANCE HALL   NIGHT                                  67 
TONY is conferring with his speech writers and assistants as VALENTINA descends the staircase looking utterly stunning in a beautiful gown. TONY bows, romantically kissing her hand. He turns her to admire their reflections in a gilt mirror...the perfect, beautiful, dream couple. 
TONY You look gorgeous, my love.   I knew you wouldn't let me down. 
The little girl, OLGA, and a little boy are brought forward. They are dressed in ethnic clothes. TONY takes OLGA'S hand...offers the little boy's hand to VALENTINA. She takes it in her own. The four of them start to walk to the door leading to the ballroom. 
TONY (CONT'D) (looking to everyone) This is a vitally important moment for the future of the Foundation. The children of the world are depending on us.

67   CONTINUED:                                                    67 
ANTON (V.O.) Valentina! 
VALENTINA Anton!? 
TONY and VALENTINA look around. ANTON is nowhere to be seen but, his voice continues. 
ANTON (V.O.) All of this is false! It's nothing to do with you! It's all him. It's his imagination! 
TONY Call security, somebody. 
ANTON (V.O.) It's all rotten! A naked lie! You've got to understand! 
GUESTS (O.S.) There he is! Stop him! Leave her alone. Get him! 
Throwing his arm around TONY, PARNASSUS spins him around to face the MOB rushing towards him. 
DR. PARNASSUS I create the opportunities. Is it my fault if your not up to it? 
Tony wrenches his arm free and violently shoves the drunken DOCTOR right into the path of the frenzied MOB. PARNASSUS is trampled underfoot in their rush to catch TONY. 
VALENTINA Father! No! 
PARNASSUS'S body lies broken on the ground. Frantically, VALENTINA rushes to him, throwing herself on her father's battered body, sobbing hysterically. 
VALENTINA (CONT'D) NO..NO NO... Please.. father..it's all my fault. What have I done?... 
With siren wailing, an AMBULANCE arrives, screeching to a halt. PARAMEDICS pull VALENTINA away. They check PARNASSUS for signs of life and begin to lift him onto the gurney. VALENTINA can't control herself and tries to throw herself onto his body. The PARAMEDICS struggle with her. 
PARAMEDIC (with a severe stutter) P-p-p-lease m-mis-s, there's-s n-n-othing y-y-y-you c-can d-d-o, he-he-he's d-d-dead...

68   CONTINUED: (3)                                              68 
VALENTINA NOOOOO...!!! 
VALENTINA wrenches herself out of their grasp howling like an animal and rushes away out of earshot before the PARAMEDIC can finish speaking. 
PARAMEDIC ...d-dead drunk. 
A bottle falls from the DOCTOR'S hand and explodes in a million fragments as it hits the ground. 
The shimmering fragments coalesce into a fractured mirror corridor down which a multi-reflected VALENTINA runs - sobbing like a madwoman - lashing out at her reflections, some of which are flashbacks of her flirting with TONY, irritated with ANTON, angry with PARNASSUS. 
VALENTINA (to her reflections) You little fool! You're to blame!.. for everything... I hate you! 
The multi-reflection broken mirror corridor ends at two mirrors identical to the one used in the Imaginarium. The one to the left is marked 'His' with a bowler hat, the other to the right 'Hers' with a bonnet. She hesitates. 
VALENTINA (CONT'D) (laughing madly) So this is to be my choice!! 
MR NICK appears out of the "His" mirror - a burst of flame behind him. 
He makes a sweeping gesture inviting VALENTINA to enter the mirror marked 'Hers'. 
VALENTINA, heads for the mirror marked 'His'. MR NICK blocks her path. 
MR NICK Now, there's absolutely no need for that. That's just plain contrariness. 
VALENTINA tries to get around him. 
(CONTINUED) 
68   CONTINUED: (4)                                            68 
MR NICK (CONT'D) You think you deserve punishment but you're a kid - you have no idea...trust me. 
VALENTINA feints another direction. MR NICK blocks her. 
VALENTINA (a crazed look) Wrong. I'm 16...I'm a woman now.. 
She spins around him...he blocks....a kind of dance between them begins - confusingly reflected in the mirrors. A tango can be heard. 
VALENTINA (CONT'D) ...a selfish bitch, everyone I love dies...I'm... 
MR NICK ...only fit for hell? If only. 
He looks at Valentina with lascivious intent. He's tempted, briefly, but resists it. 
MR NICK (CONT'D) No... your pop would never speak to me again. And that'd be a shame. Let's dance. 
Reflected in the swirling mirror fragments, they tango until he spins her towards the right hand mirror. She sails through - and, with a mad smile, throws him a kiss. 
The mirror closes with a burst of flame. The briefest flash of DR. PARNASSUS face is reflected in the mirror fragments. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS O/S Valentina!!!!!! 
MR NICK turns, realizing he has been looking into a mirror fragment reflecting the two mirrors. The writing on the Valentina's mirror reads "His". 
MR NICK Damn!... I've won. 
69   EXT   STRANGE   MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE                           69 
DR. PARNASSUS is sitting alone on a prominent bluff (the same one he tried throwing himself off many years ago) He's distraught. Tears run down this cheeks. A distant bell tolls midnight. 
MR NICK appears behind PARNASSUS...sits down beside him. 
MR NICK Funny how things work out, isn't it? 
He lights a cigarette. 
MR NICK (CONT'D) It's not what I had in mind y'know... this.. Valentina, being the fifth... It doesn't seem right... She's supposed to be the prize, the star prize... not part of the bloody score... And you lumbered with eternal life all over again... What a bummer, eh? 
No response from PARNASSUS. A Tarot cards drops from his hand. It is The Hanged Man. 
MR. NICK points to the plain far below. Across the harsh ground, TONY is running for his life...pursued by the MOB. 
MR NICK (CONT'D) I hope they get that bastard. Tear him limb from limb... But they won't... He leads a charmed life, that one... I've been trying to nail him for years... I thought I had him this time. But, there's always some prat comes to his rescue... Talk about the luck of the Devil. (he laughs) Those weird markings you found on him... on his forehead... Those satanic-symbol, so-called, things... What's all that about?... Maybe they protect him in some way... I've never been into that black-magic stuff myself... Can't seem to get the hang of it... I know, pathetic isn't it?... 
The tube pops out of the DOCTOR'S gullet. TONY catches it. 
TONY Gotcha! 
TONY swallows the tube as the MOB surge around the gibbet, grabbing him, beating him, and then lifting him onto the chair, tightening the noose around his neck. 
(CONTINUED) 
70   CONTINUED: (3)                                             70 
Although battered, TONY winks smugly at DR. PARNASSUS, but his mood changes when he sees DR. PARNASSUS spit out several more fake tubes, then, gagging, force the real one up and out of his gullet. 
With a look of realization and horror, TONY drops to his death as the MOB kicks the chair away from under him. 
The MOB cheers. Yes, he's dead. 
DR. PARNASSUS tosses the metal tube to MR NICK who steps coolly out of the MOB, cigarette in his mouth. 
DR. PARNASSUS (hoarsely) There are three cardinal rules. One, there's no black-magic, only cheap tricks. And... er... I forget the others. Now, where's my daughter? 
MR NICK How should I know? You're her father. (with needle) Her loving father. 
DR PARNASSUS looks askance at MR NICK. 
MR NICK (CONT'D) She's free... isn't she? 
MR NICK smiles and blows smoke in PARNASSUS'S face. The smoke fills the screen and becomes... 
71   EXT   DESERT     DAY                                       71 
... a dust storm. The wind is howling. The swirling dust thins to reveal DR.PARNASSUS, alone, exhausted, trudging across a vast desert. 
He's tormented by his thoughts. 
DR. PARNASSUS What else could I do, Valentina? What else could I have done... What other choice could I have made?... Damn!... It was the right choice... Of course it was... Of course... But where are you? (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
71   CONTINUED:                                                 71 DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D) Where's my beautiful daughter? Where's my darling? How long must I suffer? 
There is no proper road, only endless sand, but nevertheless DR. PARNASSUS reaches a signpost which indicates two distinct paths. 
One leads to a tidy little suburban home, the other up an dramatic mountain pass via a painfully steep staircase cut into the rock (the same one that MARTIN THE DRUNK chose not to climb days earlier. 
DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D) No, no, no... No more choices, please... No more choices...!!! 
Enraged, he tries to push the sign over, but is too feeble. Exhausted, he subsides onto a smooth protruding stone. 
VOICE (V.O.) (angry) Hey! 
DR. PARNASSUS, alarmed, rolls quickly off the stone. 
Now on his knees he finds himself looking at the top half of PERCY'S head and face. What he'd thought was a stone was, in fact, his old companion buried in the sand. 
DR. PARNASSUS Percy! 
DR. PARNASSUS, overjoyed, begins to dig PERCY out. 
PERCY About bloody time! 
DR. PARNASSUS Where have you been? 
PERCY (irritated) Here! 
DR. PARNASSUS How long have you been here? 
PERCY How long's a piece of string? Don't ask daft questions. 
(CONTINUED) 
71   CONTINUED: (2)                                             71 
DR. PARNASSUS Thank God I found you. I need your advice. (indicating sign) I've got a problematical choice to make. 
PERCY Problematical my arse! Come on... I know it's against the grain... 
PERCY grabs DR. PARNASSUS'S cloak and begins to pull him across the sand in the direction of the bungalow. We can now see the sign reads `Easy'... 
DR. PARNASSUS (on his dignity) No! Suburban bungalows and all that they evoke are anathema to me. Dammit Percy! Stop! I've got my pride! 
PERCY Yeah, it goes just before the fall. 
PERCY grabs DR. PARNASSUS'S cloak and begins to pull him across the sand in the direction indicated by the sign which we can now see reads 'Easy'.. 
PERCY (CONT'D) Come on... I know it's against the grain... 
72   EXT   SUBURBAN BUNGALOW                                    72 
PERCY pulls the reluctant DR. PARNASSUS up the drive of a suburban bungalow, past a perfect lawn and double garage, to the front door. 
PERCY rings the bell. 
DR. PARNASSUS tries to make a run for it but PERCY holds him fast. 
The door is opened by VALENTINA. She's older and is carrying a BABY in her arms.

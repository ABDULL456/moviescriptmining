"Philadelphia", by Ron Nyswaner 
PHILADELPHIA 
by RON NYSWANER 
September 21, 1992 
FADE IN: 
VARIOUS SHOTS OF PHILADELPHIA EXTERIORS (EXT./DAY) ... 
which may include the Liberty Bell, the Italian Market, scenes along the Delaware and Schuylkill Rivers, Independence Square, the Russian Orthodox neighborhood, the ghettos of North Philly. 
MAIN TITLES PLAY OVER THIS SEQUENCE which culminates in a SHOT OF... 
CUT TO: 
PHILADELPHIA'S GLORIOUSLY ORNATE CITY HALL (EXT./DAY) ... 
TITLE: "Philadelphia City Hall." 
CITY EMPLOYEES, JUDGES, COPS, LAWYERS, CRIMINALS, TOURISTS pour into City Hall, into... 
TO: 
TWO STORY HIGH CORRIDORS THAT REEK OF HISTORY (INT-DAY). 
Young lawyer JAMEY COLLINS darts through the crowd, carrying an accordion file under his arm like a football. 
Jamey elbows his way through a JAPANESE TOUR GROUP. 
Jamey trots up a marble staircase, two steps at a time 
TO: 
JAMEY RUNS LIKE HELL DOWN A THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR, FOOTSTEPS making a racket... 
Jamey rushes toward a door marked "JUDGE TATE." 
RAISED VOICES from inside Judge Tate's chambers: 
JOSEPH MILLER (OS) This construction site is causing mortal and irreparable harm to an unsuspecting public! 
ANDREW BECKETT (OS) My client has one of the finest and most respected safety records in the business, Your Honor! 
Jamey shoves open the door, REVEALING TWO LAWYERS (BACKS TO CAMERA) STANDING BEFORE JUDGE EUNICE TATE: ANDREW BECKETT (in conservative gray) and JOSEPH MILLER (in pinstripes). 
JUDGE TATE One at a time. Mr. Miller? 
JOE Your Honor, since Rockwell Corp. began construction, the surrounding residential neighborhood has been enshrouded in a cloud of foul-smelling, germ-carrying, pestilent dust. My client is being forced to breathe known carcinogens daily! Other residents are coming forth on a daily basis to add their voices of outrage! 
ANDREW Your Honor, I submit there were no complaints until Counselor began knocking on doors, drumming up business. And the dust, which Counselor refers to, has appeared on only three occasions. Each time it has been examined and the results... 
Behind his back, Andrew wiggles his fingers. Jamey stuffs a document into Andrew's hand. 
ANDREW (CONT.) Limestone. Messy, but innocuous. 
Andrew submits the report to the Judge. 
JOE Innocuous? 
ANDREW Defined by Webster's as harmless. 
JOE I know what it means. Your Honor, imagine how the children in this neighborhood have been made to feel. The pounding of construction ringing in their ears as this skyscraper, a tribute to mankind's greed, grows daily, casting an ominous shadow over their lives, filling them with dread even as they are surrounded in a black, toxic fog, blocking out the sun while poisoning their lungs! And Counselor calls it harmless?! 
His back turned momentarily to the JUDGE, Andrew mouths to Jamey: "Not bad." But he whips around, serious again: 
ANDREW Your Honor, Counselor is attempting to portray my client as a hideous manifestation of evil and corruption. But nothing could be further from the truth. Rockwell has generously contributed ten thousand dollars to this neighborhood's schools, clinics and youth centers! Granting a restraining order on the construction site will throw hundreds of Philadelphians out of work, and will lend validation to this contemptible and groundless nuisance suit, which speaks directly to the kind of greed and treachery that today is threatening the very fabric of our society. 
Judge Tate looks skeptically at both lawyers. 
JUDGE TATE Let's not go off the deep end, gentlemen. I thought we were talking about some dust. 
CUT TO: 
A MAN ON CRUTCHES HOBBLES INTO A COURTHOUSE ELEVATOR AND IS joined by Andrew and Joe, crowding inside (INT./DAY) ... 
As soon as the doors close, Andrew whips out a micro- cassette recorder, making notes, and Joe, in the opposite corner of the elevator, does exactly the same thing. 
ANDREW                      JOE ... plaintiff seeks to re-     ... whereas decedent had strain defendants from con-    pre-existing asthmatic tinued improper use of trade   condition and ride on name without...                Ultra Loop caused sub- sequent death... 
Andrew and Joe stop at the same time, look at each other... 
And turn toward the corner, seeking privacy. 
ANDREW (CONT.)              JOE (CONT.) ... plaintiff's permission or  ... complainant seeks authorization...               relief... 
There's a PERSISTENT BEEPING, Andrew and Joe pull out their portable telephones at the same time. 
They look at each other: which phone is ringing? 
RACHEL I'm late, I have to pick up Amy from her afterschool but I want to talk to you about that Hansen thing. 
ANDREW Catch me later, I'll be here. And tell Amy, I love her painting, it's on my wall. 
Andrew SAILS toward his office. 
CONTINUOUS CUT TO: 
ANDREW ENTERS HIS OFFICE, KICKING THE DOOR SHUT (INT./DAY). 
... DROPPING the documents on his desk, SCANNING them. 
... ADMIRING a child's painting taped to the wall. 
... PUNCHING into the speaker phone on his desk. 
The SCREEN SPLITS, REVEALING A TELECONFERENCE OPERATOR: 
OPERATOR ... Karen Hargreave, representing Lloyd Management Corporation? 
The SCREEN SPLITS INTO THIRDS: Andrew, the OPERATOR, and HARGREAVE (a sharp, California lawyer.) 
HARGREAVE Present. 
As the OPERATOR continues the roll call, the SCREEN CONTINUES TO SPLIT and HARGREAVE is replaced by a SERIES OF LAWYERS in offices around the country, (MOSTLY WHITE MALES) saying "Present" while in Andrew's section of the screen... 
... Andrew dials a number on another telephone line, 
OPERATOR Andrew Beckett, representing Saunders International? 
Andrew punches into the conference call 
ANDREW Present. 
The MULTI-IMAGE SCREEN is now joined by SARAH BECKETT, a suburban, 60ish American MOM, in her backyard garden, answering a portable phone. 
SARAH Hello? 
ANDREW Hi, Mom. It's me. 
The LAWYERS are into the conference, in their portions of the screen, (their VOICES HEARD underneath Andrew's conversation with his mother). 
SARAH Andy! This is a nice surprise. How are you, hon? 
ANDREW I'm fine. 
SARAH What's Dr. Gillman say? 
ANDREW Hold on, Mom. (punching into the conference call) There's no way my client will go along with that. 
HARGREAVE Who's this? 
ANDREW Andrew Beckett. Hi, Karen. I'm sorry I interrupted... 
He punches out of the conference, back to his Mom (glancing over his shoulder to make sure the door is shut). 
ANDREW (CONT.) Gillman says I'm fine. My blood work is excellent. T-cells are up. Just a sec ... (conference call) Yes, I think that would alleviate most of our concerns. (back to Mom) My platelets look good too. 
SARAH Are you on one of those conference calls? I hate when you put me on hold. 
CUT ON ANDREW'S LAUGHTER TO: 
THE MOON ABOVE THE WHEELER BUILDING LATE AT NIGHT (EXT.) 
TITLE: "One-thirty a.m." 
CUT TO: 
ANDREW AT WORK IN THE FIRM'S LIBRARY (INT./NIGHT) ... 
Andrew's fingers FLY across the keys of a notebook computer. 
Needing a reference, he shoves his rolling chair away from the computer... opens a reference book... grabs a carton of Chinese food... (NOTE: The library may be equipped with a computer terminal which Andrew uses for reference, rather than a book.) 
Andrew eats sauteed string beans with chopsticks, finding a relevant citation: 
ANDREW Ah hah! Yes! (chewing a string bean) Rentworth v. Pennsylvania... court of appeals affirms jury award of punitive damages for wrongful interference with prospective economic relations... 
A SHADOW falls across Andrew. He IGNORES IT. 
ANGLE: TWO MEN IN SILHOUETTE. WALTER KENTON says: 
KENTON Look at this fucking guy. He's an animal. 
Andrew's hands DO NOT LEAVE the keyboard. 
ANDREW Walter. 
The SECOND MAN steps forward, a silhouette becoming visible This is BOB SEIDMAN. He and Kenton wear tuxedos. 
SEIDMAN Are we interrupting, Andy? 
ANDREW He's not sorry, okay, fine. (the diplomat) Why don't we see what we find out from the blood work? I'll work on getting a specimen, I'm sure hospital food could help in that direction. Maybe, by then, we'll hear from my doctor, and we'll go from there. Okay? Everybody happy? 
INTERN Allright. I'll get on the lab about the blood work. 
MIGUEL (to the Intern) I'm sorry. 
The INTERN walks away. Andrew's BEEPER BEEPS. 
ANDREW That's the third time. I better call the office. (smiling at Niguel) Would you relax, please? 
MIGUEL I am relaxed. 
Andrew HOBBLES toward a pay phone, outside a VISITOR LOUNGE, where weary relatives are watching TV. 
Andrew drops a quarter into the phone. 
JOE MILLER'S VOICE "If you or someone you know..." 
ANDREW'S POV ON TELEVISION: Joe Miller on the screen, with the words "Negligence... Malpractice... Auto accidents"... and in the background, PHOTOS of MAIMED, BURNED, INJURED CLIENTS. 
JOE (CONT.) "... has been injured through the fault of others, you may be entitled to legal remedy... 
Andrew LAUGHS. Then, his call is answered: 
ANDREW Shelby? It's me. Jamey's been beeping me, I... Okay, okay, calm down. Put Jamey on. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
FIRST YEAR ASSOCIATE JAMEY COLLINS, SITTING AT ANDREW'S DESK (INT/DAY), GRABS THE PHONE when Andrew's intercom BUZZES... 
JAMEY (frantic) Andy?! This is a disaster! We can't find your revisions on the Kronos complaint! 
ANDREW Slow down, Jamey, for Christ's sake! 
JAMEY I went down to Word Processing to pick up the corrected copy, but they said you haven't delivered the corrections. I told them you've been working on it at home, and... 
Andrew forgets his physical pain, this is more important. 
ANDREW I brought it in last night, around midnight. It's in my computer. 
JAMEY What did you file it under? 
Jamey puts his hands on Andrew's computer keyboard. 
ANDREW K-R-O-one. 
Jamey types the file name. 
ANDREW (CONT.) Jamey, I don't have to mention, do I, that we're up against a statute of limitations on this complaint which runs out in... (checks his watch) Seventy-five minutes. 
Jamey stares dumbfounded at the computer monitor. 
JAMEY It's not here, Andy. 
Andrew closes his eyes. He can't believe this. 
ANDREW You go down to Word Processing and tell those motherfuckers they better come up with that complaint, now! Or they are fucking dead! You tell them that comes from me! 
Andrew SLAMS the phone into its cradle. 
He pauses, takes a deep breath, and says to himself: 
ANDREW (CONT.) Every problem has a solution. Every problem... has... a... solution. 
Calmer, Andrew returns to the gurney, putting on his shirt. 
ANDREW (CONT.) Every problem has a solution... 
Miguel approaches with tea purchased at the canteen. 
MIGUEL Why are you getting dressed? 
ANDREW You're not going to like this. Please try to smile... 
Andrew puts his arms around Miguel. 
ANDREW (CONT.) Thanks for leaving school, and coming here, and... (pulling back, putting on his jacket) I will be back. An hour, tops. 
MIGUEL You're going to the office?! 
ANDREW You're not smiling. 
Andrew rushes toward the exit doors. 
MIGUEL You're leaving the hospital? You're going into the office looking like that? Are you insane? 
ANDREW One hour! 
MIGUEL Drew! 
ANDREW I promise! 
SEIDMAN You'll never find it in the dark. 
Seidman FLIPS ON the overhead light. Andrew flinches. 
Seidman approaches. Andrew gives up trying to hide the purple blotches, facing his mentor straight on. 
SEIDMAN (CONT.) What in God's name... ? 
ANDREW Bob... 
SEIDMAN What's wrong with your face? 
ANDREW What's wrong with my face? You want to know what's wrong with my face? I've got a skin condition. Next question, Bob? No more questions? Fine. Now can you help me find the complaint? 
SEIDMAN Allright. Calm down. 
ANDREW Sorry... 
Seidman sits in front of Andy's computer. 
SEIDMAN What was the file name? 
ANDREW K-R-O-one. 
SEIDMAN Maybe you mistyped the name when you were saving it. We'll try combinations of those letters... 
Seidman goes to work. Andrew leans over his shoulder. 
ANDREW You're right, I probably just misfiled... 
KENTON (O.S.) Andy? 
Walter Kenton is standing at Andrew's door. His demeanor is casual. So casual it seems a little forced. 
KENTON (CONT.) Some sort of problem? 
Andrew has kept his face averted. But now he TURNS DIRECTLY TOWARD CAMERA, showing his face to Kenton. 
ANDREW Yeah, Walter. Yeah. Some sort of major problem. 
HOLD ON THIS CLOSE UP OF ANDREW... 
SOUND OF A BABY CRYING CROSSES THE CUT TO: 
A NEWBORN BEING LIFTED INTO A DOCTOR'S HANDS (INT./DAY) ... 
DOCTOR There she is, okay. You can relax now, Lisa. 
LISA MILLER has just given birth to a baby girl. She collapses on her pillow, gasping for breath, moaning in pain, quietly crying a little. 
TITLE: "One month later." 
The NURSES and the (FEMALE) DOCTOR move professionally around the bed, doing their jobs. 
At Lisa's side, Joe fumbles with a camera while darting amazed looks back and forth between Lisa and the baby. 
JOE Oh my god... a girl... oh my god... Lisa... oh my god... 
He's frantic. 
JOE (CONT.) You load the film... ? No, on this side... or this side? Don't move the baby! 
LISA Give me the camera, Joe. 
Lisa pops the film into the camera, hands it back. 
JOE Thanks, hon. Oh my god... 
With wildly trembling hands, Joe begins SNAPPING PHOTOS. 
JOE (CONT.) Oh my god... oh my god, look at her... oh my god... 
CUT TO: 
JOE, WALKING THE HOSPITAL CORRIDOR, STILL WEARING SURGEON'S greens, SPEAKING INTO HIS PORTABLE PHONE (INT./DAY) ... 
JOE Go to Famous Fourth Street and buy a pound of Nova. No! She likes Scotch salmon better. Ah heck, get a pound of both! Get a dozen onion rolls. Get some bagels. Get a dozen. Get a bottle of champagne. Dom Peringon... A hundred bucks a bottle?! Better get a good California... 
Passing a PATIENT IN TRACTION, ROLLING BY ON A GURNEY, Joe drops a business card into the PATIENT'S broken hand. 
JOE (CONT.) (to the PATIENT) Give me a call. (into the phone) Get everything over here as soon as you can, she's starved. No, not the baby! Lisa! ... Iris, listen: any calls I should know about? ... Uh huh... Uh huh... Beckett? Who's Andrew Beckett? 
Turning a corner, Joe comes face to face with HIS RELATIVES, who charge at him joyfully: 
JOE'S MOTHER/AUNTS/UNCLES, ETC. Congratulations! How is Lisa?! When can we see the baby?! 
CUT TO: 
QUIET... JOE, LISA AND THEIR BABY CUDDLED TOGETHER IN Lisa's hospital bed, surrounded by debris from a party, paper plates, empty champagne bottle (INT./NIGHT) ... 
The relatives have gone. It's late at night. 
JOE Uh, yeah. 
Andrew hesitates. Joe doesn't sound sure. 
JOE (CONT.) Go ahead. 
Andrew sits, Joe returns to his desk. (Joe finds himself acutely aware of where Andrew places his hands.) 
ANDREW (the cigars) New baby? 
JOE One week old. 
ANDREW Congratulations. 
JOE Little baby girl. 
ANDREW Kids are great. 
JOE Thanks, Beckett. I'm real excited about it. (glances at his watch) What can I do for you? 
ANDREW I was fired by Wyant Wheeler. I plan to bring a wrongful termination suit against Charles Wheeler and his partners. 
JOE You want to sue Wyant Wheeler Hellerman Tetlow and Brown? 
ANDREW Correct. I'm seeking representation. 
JOE Continue. 
ANDREW I misplaced an important complaint. That's their story. Want to hear mine? 
JOE How many lawyers did you go to, before you called me? 
ANDREW Nine. 
JOE Continue. 
ANDREW I was diagnosed with AIDS eight months ago. During a bout of pneumonia. I recovered quickly and was back at work in ten days. Since I was doing so well on the AZT, we decided against telling anyone about it. 
JOE We? 
ANDREW My lover and I. 
JOE Your... lover? 
ANDREW Miguel Alvarez. We've lived together for nine years. 
JOE Continue. 
ANDREW I dove back into work, everything was fine. Until the lesions started... 
SUDDENLY PICTURE CUTS TO: 
TIGHT ON ANDREW WAUKING THROUGH THE LOBBY OF THE WHEELER Building (INT./DAY). He's wearing MAKEUP, which sort of covers the blotches. (NOTE: PICTURE and ANDREW'S VOICE OVER do NOT match up. This is no ordinary flashback) ... 
ANDREW (VO) (CONT.) First on my leg. Then my forearm, my back. Then... my face. For a short period, I avoided the office during the day, waiting for the chemo therapy to clear up the lesions... 
IMAGE: ANDREW RIDING THE CROWDED ELEVATOR ON A WORKDAY. 
ANDREW (VO) (CONT.) But I never let anything slide. I made all my calls from home. I worked sixteen hour days on a complaint for a 350 million dollar copyright infringement suit. 
IMAGE: JOE IN HIS OFFICE, ABSORBED IN ANDREW'S STORY. 
ANDREW (OS) (CONT.) But the day the complaint was due, it disappeared. Erased from my computer. I thought I was losing it, mentally... 
IMAGE: ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING, ANDREW STEPPING INTO WYANT WHEELER OFFICES. NOW HE SPEAKS DIRECTLY TO CAMERA: 
ANDREW (CONT.) That can happen, it's called AIDS dementia when it gets into your brain. But miraculously, a copy of the complaint was located at the last minute, and we got it to court on time... 
IMAGE: ANDREW'S POV OF COLLEAGUES, STAFF IN THE OFFICES, GIVING HIM LOOKS, WHISPERING. ANTHEA BURTON NODS HELLO. 
ANDREW (OS) (CONT.) The next morning, I was called to the office for a meeting with the managing partners. Walking down that corridor was strange. Felt like everyone was staring. 
REVERSE ANGLE ON ANDREW AND JOE WALKING AT ANDREW'S SIDE. 
JOE Hell, they are staring. What's that shit on your face? 
ANDREW Makeup. 
ANDREW'S POV: RACHEL OUTSIDE HER OFFICE, SAYS "GOOD LUCK." 
ANDREW (CONT.) The partners were waiting for me in the main conference room. 
CONTINUOUS CUT TO: 
CAMERA TRACKS INTO THE CONFERENCE ROOM, GIVING US ANDREW'S POV as he enters the room where Wheeler, Kenton, Killcoyne, Bob Seidman are waiting (INT./DAY) ... 
WHEELER Sit down, Andy. 
Wheeler's secretary, LYDIA, takes notes. 
WHEELER (CONT.) Thanks for coming in. 
LISA That's perfectly clear. 
CLOSE ON JOE, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA: 
JOE Would you take a client if you were constantly thinking: "I hope this guy doesn't touch me. I don't even want him to breathe on me?" 
CUT TO: 
THE STREETS OF PHILLY ARE DUSTED WITH SNOW, STORE WINDOWS decorated for Christmas. Joe steps out of the Famous 4th St. Deli, with a package (EXT./DAY) ... 
TITLE: "Two weeks later." 
CUT TO: 
JOE SITS AT A TABLE IN THE PUBLIC LAW LIBRARY, SURROUNDED BY books and legal pads, hard at work. He's eating a pastrami sandwich which he hides behind a reference book when a LIBRARIAN saunters by (INT./DAY) ... 
A CHAIR SQUEAKS and Joe LOOKS UP TO SEE: 
Andrew taking a seat across the room (the blotches have been reduced by chemo, but he's struggling with a cold). Andrew removes notepads and pens from his briefcase. He takes out a package of tissues, blowing his nose. 
JOE (under his breath) Shit... 
Joe slides to the far end of his table, stacking seven or eight HUGE REFERENCE BOOKS in front of him. 
JOE'S POV, PEERING THROUGH THE REFERENCE BOOKS: 
Andrew opens a book, taking notes. Rubs his eyes. Writes something. Sneezes. 
A LIBRARIAN delivers a book to Andrew. 
LIBRARIAN This is the supplement. You're right, there is a section on... (lowers her voice) ... HIV related discrimination. 
ANDREW Thank you. 
Andrew takes the book from her -- but she remains. 
LIBRARIAN We have a private research room available. 
ANDREW I'm fine, thanks. 
Andrew BLOWS HIS NOSE. Now other PATRONS are watching. 
LIBRARIAN Wouldn't you be more comfortable in a research room? 
ANDREW (pleasantly) No. But would it make you more comfortable? 
LIBRARIAN Whatever, sir. 
The LIBRARIAN turns away, shrugging to a PATRON, indicating she's done all she can do. 
As Joe continues to watch: one of Andrew's NEIGHBORS picks up his books and moves away. 
Joe rises, gliding down an aisle of books, keeping one eye on Andrew, who concentrates on his work. 
Joe approaches, nonchalantly, as if he just happens to be sauntering by. Suddenly he "notices" Andrew. 
JOE Oh, Beckett. How's it goin'? 
ANDREW Fine. 
Andrew goes back to his work. 
JOE Who'd you get? 
ANDREW What? 
JOE Find a lawyer? 
ANDREW I'm a lawyer. How's your baby? 
JOE Huh? Oh. Great. She's great. 
ANDREW What's her name? 
JOE Rayisha. 
ANDREW Rayisha. Very nice. 
Andrew focuses on his work. Joe steps away. 
Joe comes back. 
JOE How did they find out? 
ANDREW (a second, then:) One of the partners spotted a lesion on my forehead. 
Nearby, a CHINESE PROFESSOR looks up, startled, when she hears the word "lesion." 
JOE Uh huh... 
Andrew concentrates on his work once more. 
DR. J. Gentlemen... Ladies... 
JULIUS ERVING enters, greeted by the LAWYERS. 
LAWYERS How's it goin', Doctor?/This is an honor!/etc ... 
The door is opened again, by the SECURITY GUARD, REVEALING Joe Miller (in jeans and basketball jacket) and a MARSHALL. 
JOE Excuse me. Charles Wheeler? 
Wheeler turns. Joe SLAPS a document into Wheeler's hand. 
JOE (CONT.) Summons. For you. 
NOW the box is QUIET. 
DR. J. Say. What's up, Chuck? 
CUT TO: 
THE BRIGHTLY LIT, RESTRICTED, INNER CORRIDOR OF SPECTRUM Stadium (INT./NIGHT) where Wheeler walks beside Bob Seidman, with Walter Kenton and Kenneth Killcoyne just behind. SOUNDS OF THE GAME STILL IN PROGRESS can be heard, but FAR AWAY. Occasionally the lawyers are passed by FOOD SERVICE or LAUNDRY SERVICE EMPLOYEES... 
WHEELER ... interview every employee, support staff, associates, partners. Did any of them know Andy was sick? How did they know? Did he tell them? Did they notice something was wrong with his appearance? None of this information got to the managing partners. We know that. Make sure everyone else does too... And Beckett: I want to know everything about his personal life. Did he frequent those pathetic bars on Camac Street? 
SEIDMAN Jesus. 
WHEELER (ignoring Seidman) What about other homosexual facilities, whatever they are? 
SEIDMAN Charles... 
WHEELER What deviant groups or organizations did he secretly belong to? (with irritation) What is it, Bob?! 
SEIDMAN Let's settle with Andy and put this whole tragic mess behind us. 
They arrive at a quiet, semi-private cul de sac. 
WHEELER Andrew brought AIDS into our offices, into our men's room. He brought AIDS to our annual goddamn family picnic. 
KENTON We ought to be suing him. 
SEIDMAN For Christ's sake, where's your compassion? 
KENTON Compassion? Andy sucks cocks, Bob. He takes it up the ass. He's a pervert. 
Only Seidman shows any kind of REACTION. 
SEIDMAN That's kind of... extreme, Walt. Andy's private life is none of our business. 
WHEELER Bob. You're trying my patience. Andrew Beckett is making his private life our business. We gave him Kronos. Did he say, "I'm sick. I might not be able to see this through?" 
SEIDMAN He was doing a great job. 
WHEELER Bob. I must ask you to shut the fuck up. Did Andrew Beckett say "I might not be able to serve our clients to the best of my ability?" He said nothing. And now, Andrew Beckett proposes to haul me into a court of law, to sling accusations at me, in full view of the entire, Philadelphia, judicial establishment. My God. 
KILLCOYNE Beckett doesn't want to go to court, he's hoping for a quick tasty settlement. 
SEIDMAN A jury might decide that Andy has a case. 
WHEELER Wait a minute. The man was fired for incompetence, not because he has AIDS. You didn't know he was sick, did you, Bob? 
KENTON Holy Shit. Did you, Bob? 
SEIDMAN (after a moment) No. Not really. 
Wheeler walks away, followed by Kenton and Killcoyne. 
Bob Seidman stands alone in this dark place. 
CITY SOUNDS ON A WORK DAY AS WE CUT TO: 
EXTERIOR, JOE'S OFFICE BUILDING, ON A THURSDAY MORNING. 
CONTINUOUS CUT TO: 
JOB'S COLLEAGUE, FILKO, LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA (in Joe's offices, INT./DAY): 
FILKO Charles Fucking Wyant Wheeler?! 
Joe sweeps by, just arriving for work. 
JOE Morning, Filko. 
Filko keeps pace with Joe down the corridor. ANOTHER COLLEAGUE calls out from an office as Joe passes: 
COLLEAGUE Hey, it's the local chapter of the ACLU! 
FILKO You're a Republican, Joe! You belong to the NRA! 
JOE How many toilet stalls are there in the women's restroom on this floor, Filko? 
FILKO How many... what?! 
SARAH Ancient. How do you think I feel? Put that thing down and give me a hug. (he keeps it pointed at her) Andrew, stop! ... He still doesn't listen. 
ANDREW Where's Dad? 
SARAH He's out in his shed showing your uncle his new riding mower. 
One of Andrew's YOUNG NEPHEWS SHOVES HIS FACE into the CAMERA, UNTIL SCREEN GOES BLACK. 
CUT TO: 
QUIET (INT./DAY) ... 
Andrew and his immediate family are gathered in the den, sitting quietly, facing each other. Andrew's father, BUD, with an American flag pin in his lapel, sits next to Sarah. Jill holds the hand of her husband, REVEREND JIM. Two of Andrew's brothers, MATT and RANDY, (big, athletic guys with mustaches) are there. 
Andrew sits next to Miguel. 
ANDREW Things might be said, at the trial, that... are not going to be easy for you to hear. Things about me, about my private life. And I want to make sure it's okay with everybody. 
MATT I appreciate you asking, Andy, but really, it's your call. 
ANDREW What do you think, Jill? 
JILL To be honest, I'm worried about Mommy and Daddy. They've had to go through so much already... And, we all know... (very difficult to say) There's going to be even worse things to deal with, eventually. I wonder if it's fair to put them through this. 
Andrew's father STARES at his folded hands. 
ANDREW Mom? 
SARAH All I know is, you got through your diagnosis fine, like a trooper. But when they fired you... you were so devastated, Andy... I don't expect any of my kids to sit in the back of the bus. Fight for your rights. 
ANDREW Thanks, Mom... Dad? 
There's a pause before Bud Beckett speaks. 
BUD Supposedly, the Lord doesn't give you more trouble than you can handle. But I'm having a hard time believing that these days. 
Andrew's construction worker brother, RANDY, wipes tears from his eyes. Clearly their father is in alot of pain. 
BUD (CONT.) Andy, the way you've faced this whole thing, you and Miguel, with so much courage... your mother and I have been so very impressed... 
Andrew gazes at his father with incredible love. Miguel puts an arm around Andrew. 
BUD (CONT.) I can't imagine there is anything, that anyone could say, that would make us feel less proud of you. 
ANDREW (full of emotion) Thanks, Dad. I love you guys. How about you, Randy? 
RANDY Hey. You're my kid brother, Andy. That's the bottom line. I mean, what are those bastards going to say? You're gay? Shit, I knew that when you were five years old. 
Everyone LAUGHS. Andrew and Randy high five. 
MIGUEL Wait a minute... (to Andrew) You're gay? 
More laughter. But Jill speaks seriously: 
JILL What about you, Andy? You're not a militant type. You've always been so private. 
CLOSE ON ANDREW: 
ANDREW I guess... I don't have time for that any more. 
SARAH Jim? Will you lead us in a prayer? 
Everyone bows heads, holding hands in a circle. 
REVEREND JIM Dear Lord. Sometimes it is difficult to remember to be grateful... 
CAMERA PANS THE CIRCLE, THE PRAYING FACES. 
REVEREND JIM (CONT.) To remember, in our times of sorrow and confusion, that we have You to turn to, and each other. Bless and keep Andrew and Miguel, dear Lord, deepen and strengthen their love as they face the struggles that lay ahead. Bless and watch over all of us, fill us with Your love, Your light, and Your peace, which passeth all understanding. In Jesus' name, we pray... 
EVERYONE Amen. 
ROMANTIC MUSIC CROSSES CUT TO: 
BECKETTS' LIVINGROOM, SEEN THROUGH THE VIDEO CAMERA (DAY) ... 
A local entertainer (GUIDO PAONESSA) launches into a standard, accompanied by a single guitar player, and Bud and Sarah begin to dance, surrounded by family and friends. 
GUIDO "After all the days of Spring have flown..." 
VIDEO CAMERA PANS: RELATIVES eating cake, KIDS chasing each other, a GRANDMOTHER in a wheelchair holding a NEWBORN, watching silent, video home movies. 
CAMERA FINDS Andrew and Niguel eating anniversary cake (Andrew barely touches his). Playing for the camera, Miguel dips his finger into icing and smears it onto Andrew's nose. Andrew tries to reach the icing with his tongue. 
CAMERA PANS WITH ANDREW as he comes forward to dance with his mother, while Jill dances with their father. 
CAMERA RETURNS TO MIGUEL. MATT (behind the camera) says: 
MATT (OS) Hey, Miguel, can you imagine any two people being together for forty years? 
ZOOM IN CLOSE ON NIGUEL (who's watching Andrew): 
LAIRD We were satisfied. 
Joe and Andrew exchange a LOOK -- Laird's response surprises and disappoints them. 
JOE Were you satisfied, or were you pleased? 
Laird glances toward Charles Wheeler before answering. 
LAIRD We were satisfied. 
Joe refers to legal documents. 
JOE Mr. Laird, when I approached you about being a witness at this trial, and you agreed, you gave sworn testimony in a deposition. Is that correct? 
LAIRD That's correct. 
JOE According to the deposition, you said you were "thrilled, impressed, overwhelmed" by the quality of Andrew Beckett's work. Do you remember saying that? 
LAIRD I may have said something like that. But that's not how I feel at this moment. 
Joe takes on a street-tough tone: 
JOE Okay, Mr. Laird. Explain this to me like I'm a four year old: Did Andrew Beckett win your lawsuit for you or not? 
LAIRD We won. 
JOE Did that thrill, impress and overwhelm you? 
LAIRD It satisfied me. 
Joe STARES at the guy. 
JOE It's a long way between being overwhelmed and being satisfied. A cheeseburger may be satisfying whereas caviar and champagne and roast duck and baked Alaska for dessert might be considered overwhelming. Do you agree? 
LAIRD I might. 
JOE Five months ago you characterized Andrew Beckett as caviar and now you're calling him a cheeseburger. Your standards have shifted a great deal, and I'd like to know why you've changed your mind. 
LAIRD Since that time I've devoted more thought to the subject, and that's how I feel now. 
QUICK CUT TO: 
JEROME GREEN CROSS-EXAMINING LAIRD (INT./DAY). 
JEROME GREEN Partner Robert Seidman was the supervising attorney for your lawsuit? 
MR. LAIRD That's right. 
JEROME GREEN Does the supervising attorney guide the litigating attorney during the trial? 
MR. LAIRD Often, he does. 
JEROME GREEN As far as you know, in the handling of your lawsuit, Andrew Beckett was simply following orders. 
LAIRD That's a fair assessment of the situation. 
Andrew glances over his shoulder: at Robert Seidman, who meets his gaze.

SPECTATORS STREAM OUT OF CITY HALL INTO THE HUBBUB OF TWO DISTINCT GROUPS SHOUTING AT EACH OTHER (EXT/DAY): GAY RIGHTS ACTIVISTS in T-shirts with pink triangles, denouncing discrimination; BORN AGAIN ACTIVISTS waving placards citing AIDS as God's punishment for homosexuality; POLICEMEN keeping them apart; A MEDIA CIRCUS getting it on videotape. 
Joe and Miguel FLANK Andrew, who walks weakly. with a cane. Sarah and Jill follow close behind, running the gauntlet of ACTIVISTS and REPORTERS. 
Andrew's POV on a placard: "We Die - They Do Nothing!" 
Jill's POV on a placard: "AIDS Cures Homosexuality!" 
A TV CREW shines HOT LIGHTS on Andrew. 
TV REPORTER (ANGELA MEDINA) Do you see this as a gay rights issue? 
ANDREW I'm not political. I just want compensation for being fired. 
REPORTER MEDINA But you are gay, aren't you? 
IMAGE: ANDREW SEEN ON A TV SCREEN (INT./NIGHT): 
ANDREW "I don't see how that's any of your business... (a smile) But yes, I am." 
WIDE ANGLE: WE'RE IN A SPORTS BAR WHERE JOE WATCHES THE SIX O'CLOCK NEWS WITH FILKO, A LOCAL COP, OTHERS (INT./NIGHT) ... 
ON THE TV SCREEN: A microphone is shoved at Joe. 
REPORTER MEDINA "Do you believe that homosexuals deserve special treatment?" 
FILKO Hell, no! 
JOE (on TV) "Angela, we're standing in Philadelphia, the City of Brotherly Love, the birthplace of freedom, where our Founding Fathers authored the Declaration of Independence. And I don't remember that glorious document saying "All straight men are created equal." I could have sworn it says, "All men are created equal." 
CHARLIE THE COP Give me a goddamn break! 
ANTHEA Well... One time, Mr. Wheeler's secretary, Lydia, told me Mr. Wheeler had a problem with my earrings. 
JOE Your earrings? 
Anthea is wearing large, dangling African-style earrings. 
ANTHEA Apparently, Mr. Wheeler felt they were too... "ethnic" is the word she used. She said he would like it if I wore something smaller, less garish, and... more "American." 
JOE What did you say? 
ANTHEA I said my earrings are American. They're African-American. 
JOE Thank you. No more questions. 
Belinda Conine approaches Anthea. 
BELINDA Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler? 
ANTHEA Yes. 
BELINDA Were you recently promoted? 
ANTHEA Yes. I'm now in charge of the paralegal department. 
BELINDA Thank you.

CUT TO: 
JOE COMES DOWN AN AISLE OF A DRUG STORE, EXAMINING THE BABY cold medicines, carrying a box of Pampers (INT./DAY) ... 
A YOUNG MAN in grass-stained sweats, carrying a football under one arm, buying a tube of toothpaste, speaks to Joe: 
YOUNG MAN How's the trial going? It's a great case. 
Joe looks up surprised. The YOUNG MAN smiles. 
YOUNG MAN (CONT.) I saw you on television. I'm a law student. At Penn. 
Joe is flattered by the YOUNG MAN'S interest. 
JOE Good school. What year? 
YOUNG MAN Second. 
JOE Great. 
YOUNG MAN Would you like to have a drink with me? I just finished a game, I could use a beer. (a smile) I don't pick up people in drug stores every day. 
JOE Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... do you think... ? You think I'm... (low) ... gay? 
YOUNG MAN Aren't you? 
JOE What's the matter with you? Do I look gay to you? 
YOUNG MAN Do I look gay to you? Relax. 
JOE Relax? I ought to kick your faggoty little ass for you! 
YOUNG MAN Take it as a compliment. Geesh. 
But Joe is really upset. People are watching. 
JOE Don't you know this is exactly the kind of bullshit that makes people hate you guys? 
YOUNG MAN Fuck you! You want to kick my ass? You want to try? (walking away) Asshole. 
JOE You're the asshole, buddy. 
YOUNG MAN (going out) Get a life. 
Joe stands there, holding the Pampers, people STARING. 
CUT TO: 
LISA'S WORKING ON HER COMPUTER, AT HOME, WHILE JOE PACES around her desk, really upset (One year-old Rayisha sits on the desk playing with wooden salad spoons.) (INT./NIGHT) ... 
JOE But what was it?! What was this guy thinking... ?! 
LISA Don't know, Joe. 
JOE Is there some kind of expression I've picked up from Beckett?! Some kind of fairy attitude I've unconsciously adopted?! Am I walking different?! Some kind of vocal thing?! Have I picked up some kind of homo vibe?! 
LISA Have you changed your aftershave? 
JOE Very funny. I had a box of Pampers under my arm for Chrissake! 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON BOB SEIDMAN. 
CLOSE ON THE MARINE JUROR. 
CLOSE ON JAMEY COLLINS, sweating bullets on the stand. 
JUDGE GARNETT In this courtroom, Mr. Miller, justice is blind. To matters of race, creed, color, religion. And sexual orientation. 
JOE With all due respect, Your Honor... We don't live in this courtroom, do we? 
JUDGE GARNETT No. We don't... However, as regards this witness, I'm going to sustain the defense's objection. 
CUT TO: 
COURTHOUSE MEN'S ROOM, FIVE URINALS, THREE SINKS (INT./DAY). 
The MARINE JUROR, the RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR, and AN UPTIGHT BUSINESSMAN JUROR stand at the urinals, with an empty urinal between each of them. The MARINE JUROR whistles while he pees (a classic rock tune, like "Radar Love.") The BUSINESSMAN sighs, "Ahhhhhh." 
The RETIRED POSTAL WORKER JUROR jingles change. 
The ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR enters, stepping up to the urinal between the BUSINESSMAN and the MARINE. He unzips, and it seems to take him an incredibly long time to extricate his urinary organ. This does not escape the MARINE'S notice. 
ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (innocently, to Marine) I have some gay friends. What's the biggie? 
The MARINE says nothing. 
ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR (CONT.) Everybody has a couple of gay friends. Don't you? 
MARINE No, sir. I do not. 
The MARINE moves closer to the urinal, so that no one can see his private parts. 
ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR You might have them, and just not know they're gay. 
The MARINE shakes, zips, flushes, turns away. He pauses to look directly at the ROCK MUSICIAN JUROR. 
MARINE I know. 
CUT TO: 
WALTER KENTON ON THE WITNESS STAND (INT./DAY) ... 
JOE And how many weeks at a time would you be out to sea, without stopping at port? 
KENTON Anywhere from two weeks, to several months. 
JOE Any women on board? 
Kenton glances at the MARINE JUROR. 
KENTON Not when I was in the Navy. 
JOE So during those long voyages, months at a time, out to sea, no women in sight, a hundred, hardworking, robust, young men, in the prime of their life, at the peak of their natural appetites, desires, their god- given, hormonal instincts... Anything going on? 
KENTON Going on... like...? 
JOE Like... two sailors playing hide the salami. 
Andrew covers his face with his hands. 
BELINDA Objection! 
JUDGE GARNETT Mr. Miller! 
KENTON (can't resist) We had one guy like that. 
BELINDA You haven't ruled on my objection, Your Honor. 
Kenton seems eager to tell his story. Joe stands with crossed arms, waiting. 
JUDGE GARNETT Let's continue. 
JOE (to Kenton) You had one guy "like that?" 
KENTON Yeah. But we took care of him. 
JOE How did you do that? 
KENTON We stuck his head in the latrine, after ten of us had used it. 
LAUGHTER and SOME APPLAUSE from some SPECTATORS, and some JURORS. ACTIVISTS BOO and HISS. 
The JUDGE POUNDS HIS GAVEL. 
JOE You taught him a lesson. 
KENTON Yes, we did. 
JOE Like firing Andrew Beckett taught him a lesson? 
BELINDA Objection! 
ANDREW I'm not ready to die. 
MIGUEL Do you think I'm ready for it?! I hate this shit. I'm not a fucking martyr! I hate every goddamn part of it! 
Miguel slides down the wall, sitting in a heap. 
Andrew goes to him. They hug. Miguel holds him tight. 
MIGUEL (CONT.) Please don't leave me. I love you so much. Don't die, don't leave me, please... 
Miguel rocks in Andrew's arms. Andrew kisses the top of his head, holding tight. 
ANDREW I am so scared. I am so fucking, incredibly, fucking scared... 
A MOMENT. Andrew stroking Miguel's hair, as he calms down. 
ANDREW (CONT.) You know, there's only one thing to do. (beat) We have to have a party. 
CUT TO: 
JOE AND LISA STAND OUTSIDE ANDREW'S APARTMENT -- IN COSTUME. DANCE MUSIC is playing inside (INT./NIGHT) ... 
Lisa is dressed as a giant sandwich. Joe's costume looks quickly thrown together: he's wearing a suit, but has pages from a legal document stapled all over the suit. 
JOE Did I ever tell you, I hate costume parties? 
LISA My lettuce is wilting. 
The DOOR IS OPENED -- by the LEAD SINGER OF WHITE SNAKE: big hair, leather, guitar. 
ANDREW (AS ROCKER) PARRTYY! 
JOE We're friends of Beckett's. 
ANDREW It's me, you dork. 
LISA I'm Lisa Miller. 
ANDREW Glad to finally meet you. Come on in. 
CONTINUOUS CUT TO: 
JOE AND LISA FOLLOW ANDREW INTO THE APARTMENT (HE LIMPS, relying on his cane, but he's got A LOT OF ENERGY). The room is filled with two Madonnas, an M.C. Hammer, three nuns, a can of soup (INT./NIGHT) ... 
ANDREW (to Lisa) I have to introduce you to the can of soup. You can enter the costume contest together as a lunch special. 
Miguel approaches, dressed as a MEMBER OF MEGA-DEATH or ANTHRAX. He strikes a pose, contorts his face and hits an air guitar riff. Andrew crosses guitars with Miguel. Then: 
ANDREW This is Lisa Miller. Miguel Alvarez. 
Miguel's sister MARIA is passing by with a GROUP OF FRIENDS. Everyone ad libs greetings. 
MIGUEL My sister, Maria. (to Lisa) Pastrami on rye? 
LISA Corned beef. 
MIGUEL Want to dance? 
LISA Sure! 
Miguel leads Lisa away. Joe is reluctant to give her up. 
JOE Beckett. You seem... better. Energized, more alive... 
ANDREW I had a blood transfusion today. I feel great. 
Andrew studies Joe, trying to figure out the costume. 
JOE I'm a law suit. 
ANDREW Not bad. 
JOE Get it? 
ANDREW Let's find you a drink. 
Andrew leads Joe through the crowd, greeting Rachel, skin painted blue (SMURFETTE) her daughter AMY (BART SIMPSON), Anthea, TYRONE from Dr. Gillman's office (A COWBOY), and TYRONE'S LOVER (A HORSE) ... Some of Dr. Gillman's PATIENTS are here too, including the YOUNG ASIAN MAN who is now in a wheelchair. And, one or two of ANDREW'S SIBLINGS may be present as well. And Alan, Bruno and Chandra, and some arty friends and neighbors. 
ANDREW (CONT.) What do you want? 
JOE Beer. (patting his briefcase) We need to go over your Q and A. 
ANDREW Excuse me, I'm having a goddamn party, is that allright with you? 
JOE Sure. It's fine. 
ANDREW No, we have to do it. But later, allright? 
JOE Thank you. 
A MAN dressed as LA TOYA JACKSON (with fake snake) squeezes past Joe, reaching for a beer. 
JOE For a healthy baby. For Lisa to make it through the delivery. For the Phillies to get into the playoffs. 
ANDREW (no self-pity) There's a possibility I won't be around for the end of this trial. 
JOE I've considered that. 
ANDREW What happens? 
JOE We proceed, representing your estate. 
ANDREW I've made provisions in my will for some charities. Miguel will need a lawyer. I know it's not your area... 
JOE I know a good probate lawyer. 
ANDREW Thanks. (a beat) Do you like opera? 
Andrew moves to the stereo, pulling the IV line with him. 
JOE Opera? 
ANDREW Want to hear my favorite aria? 
JOE Opera? 
SUDDENLY, AN ARIA BY MARIA CALLAS FILLS THE ROOM -- startling Joe with its VOLUME. 
ANDREW (over the MUSIC) Andrea Chenier, by Giordano. This is Madeleine. She's telling how, during the French revolution, a mob set fire to her house. Her mother died, saving her. 
"I look... The place that cradled me was burning!" 
Do you hear the heartache in her voice? Then, here come the strings. Everything changes. The music fills with hope. Madeleine says... 
Andrew sways through the room to the music, pulling the IV at his side. He seems truly free and relaxed. 
ANDREW (CONT.) "It was during that sorrow that love came to me! 
A voice filled with harmony That said... Live still, I am Life!" 
"I am the god that descends From the heavens to the earth To make of the earth A heaven!" 
ANGLE ON JOE: Shifting, uncomfortable. 
ANDREW (CONT.) "I am Oblivion! I am Glory! I am Love, Love, Love!" 
The MUSIC ENDS. 
Joe sits there, fidgeting. He reaches for his briefcase organizing his notes. 
JOE I think I'll... I told Lisa. 
Andrew collects himself, as Joe rises from his chair. 
ANDREW Right. 
Andrew follows Joe to the door. 
ANDREW (CONT.) (businesslike) I'll look over the Q and A. 
JOE You're ready, don't worry. 
An awkward moment, both men standing with their hands at their sides -- will one of them initiate a handshake? 
Joe gives a little "salute," then leaves. 
CONTINUOUS CUT TO: 
JOE COMES DOWN THE HALLWAY OF THE MODERN CONDO BUILDING (INT./NIGHT) ... 
JOE Jesus. 
Suddenly, Joe HEARS: OPERA MUSIC PLAYING AGAIN. 
He pauses, listening. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
ANDREW MOVES THROUGH THE ROOM, DRINKING IN THE BEAUTIFUL, passionate MUSIC (INT./NIGHT) ... 
The IV stand catches against the sofa, tugging the line. 
Andrew pulls the line out of his arm. He moves, freer now. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
JOE STANDS OUTSIDE ANDREW'S DOOR, OPERA MUSIC PLAYING (INT./NIGHT) ... 
Joe lifts his hand to KNOCK. 
He changes his mind. 
JOE Fucking guy... 
JOE Obviously, at this time, you weren't sick. 
ANDREW It's possible I was infected with the HIV virus at that time, but I wasn't diagnosed until several years later. 
JOE You didn't look then, the way you look now? 
REVERSE -- ON ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND, BUT NOW HE LOOKS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT (The healthy. pre-AIDS Andrew.) 
ANDREW No. I was thirty pounds heavier. I was athletic. 
JOE A regular all-American guy? 
ANDREW I suppose you could say that. 
JOE Except... you were gay? 
ANDREW I still am. 
SPECTATORS CHUCKLE. 
JOE In the years you worked at Wyant Wheeler, did you ever tell Charles Wheeler you were gay? 
ANDREW No. I didn't. 
JOE Can you explain why you didn't? 
ANDREW You don't bring your personal life into a law firm. You're not supposed to have a personal life, really. Anyway, I did plan to tell Charles, eventually. But then, this thing happened at the tennis club... 
IMAGE: WHEELER. ANDREW. SEIDMAN. OTHERS IN A LOCKER ROOM OF A TENNIS CLUB, WEARING TOWELS, ENTERING A SAUNA (INT./DAY). 
WHEELER Longstreet's interested in the Harrisburg deal. 
ANDREW I'm seeing him this afternoon. 
INSIDE THE SAUNA: CAMERA PANS SEVERAL MEN. 
ANDREW (VOICE OVER) "Somebody started telling jokes." 
FIRST MAN What do you call a woman who has PMS and ESP at the same time?. 
SECOND MAN What? 
FIRST MAN A bitch who knows everything. 
LAUGHTER. Andrew keeps his eyes closed, leaning against the wall of the sauna, next to Wheeler, relaxing. 
CHARLES WHEELER How does a faggot fake an orgasm? 
Andrew opens one eye. 
CHARLES WHEELER (CONT.) He spits on your back. 
SEIDMAN Charles, that's revolting! 
All the men LAUGH, and Wheeler LAUGHS THE HARDEST. 
JOE (VOICE OVER) How did that make you feel? 
IMAGE: BACK TO THE COURTROOM. ANDREW IN THE WITNESS STAND (And it's the sick, thin Andrew with AIDS). 
ANDREW Relieved. That I'd never told him I was gay. Very relieved. 
ANGLE ON CHARLES WHEELER: shakes his head, a denial. 
JOE Are you a good lawyer? 
ANDREW I'm an excellent lawyer. 
JOE What makes you an excellent lawyer? 
ANDREW I love the law. I know the law. I excel at practicing it. It's the only thing I've ever wanted to do. 
JOE What do you love about it? 
ANDREW Well... many things. But I think the thing I love the most, is that every once in a while, not that often, but occasionally... you get to be part of justice being done. It's really quite a thrill when that happens. 
CUT TO: 
BELINDA CONINE STANDS BEFORE ANDREW (INT./DAY). 
BELINDA You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct? 
ANDREW Something like that. 
BELINDA Do you take risks? 
ANDREW In my work? Yes. Calculated risks. You have to. 
BELINDA In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life? 
ANDREW Not unnecessary ones. 
ANDREW Some do. I didn't. 
BELINDA As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right? 
ANDREW In some situations. 
BELINDA Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?! 
JOE Objection! 
BELINDA I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater? 
ANGLE ON MIGUEL, sitting next to Sarah. 
ANDREW Yes. 
BELINDA You could have infected him, isn't that right? 
ANDREW Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread. 
BELINDA Really? 
ANDREW Yes. 
Andrew wipes sweat from his forehead. 
BELINDA You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct? 
ANDREW That's right. 
BELINDA And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you. 
ANDREW Absolutely. 
BELINDA Do you have any lesions on your face at this time? 
ANDREW One. Here, in front of my ear. 
An ASSISTANT hands Conine a shaving mirror. She holds it before Andrew. 
BELINDA Remembering you are under oath, answering truthfully, can you see the lesion on your face, in this mirror, three feet away? Answering truthfully. 
Andrew looks in the mirror: the lesion is NOT very visible. 
ANDREW By the time I was fired, there were four lesions on my face, much bigger... 
BELINDA Answer the question, please. 
ANDREW No. I can't really see it. 
BELINDA Thank you. 
Andrew rubs his eyes. 
JUDGE GARNETT (OS) (far away) This would be a good time to break for the day... 
JOE (OS) (far away) Your Honor? May I have ten minutes in re-direct? 
JUDGE GARNETT (OS) (far away) Beckett? 
Andrew finds the Judge looking at him. 
JUDGE GARNETT (CONT.) Can you go on for ten minutes? 
ANDREW Yes sir. 
Joe JUMPS UP from the plaintiff's table. 
JOE I only need five! (to Belinda, reaching for the mirror) May I? 
Joe approaches Andrew, with the mirror. 
JOE (CONT.) Do you have any lesions on any part of your body, at this time, that resemble the lesions that were on your face at the time you were fired? 
ANDREW Yes. On my torso. 
JOE If it please the court, I'd like to ask Mr. Beckett to remove his shirt, so that the jury can have an accurate idea of what we're talking about. 
BELINDA We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury. 
JOE Your Honor, if Mr. Beckett was forced by his illness to use a wheelchair, would the defense ask him to park it outside? We're talking about AIDS, we're talking about lesions. Let's see what we're talking about. 
ANGLE ON MEMBERS OF THE JURY -- LOOKING APPREHENSIVE. 
JUDGE GARNETT (a moment, then) I'll allow it. Would you mind removing your shirt, Mr. Beckett? 
ANGLE ON MIGUEL -- TENSE. 
ANDREW Allright. 
The COURTROOM TURNS SILENT. 
WHEELER Yes, character. To the extent that it affects a person's ability to do a great job. 
Andrew looks away -- face shiny with sweat, breathing difficult. He takes in the rest of the court, while Wheeler's words THROB THROUGH THE AIR... 
WHEELER (CONT.) Andy worked when he wanted to work, telling us what he thought we needed to know about his lifestyle... 
ANDREW'S POV -- ON RACHEL, sitting among the spectators. Rachel begins speaking, her WORDS OVERLAPPING Wheeler's (we should get the feeling she's giving her testimony). 
RACHEL I didn't mind covering for Andy, but I did wonder... when was he planning to deal with his problem? 
Andrew blinks... what's going on? 
Looking back to the court: Joe presses in on Wheeler. 
Everything seems normal. 
WHEELER Sometimes it seems like society is run by these kinds of people. 
JOE What kind of people? 
WHEELER People who want to bend the rules... 
ANDREW'S POV -- KENNETH KILLCOYNE at the defense table: 
KILLCOYNE If you want to be a leader in this society, you have to make certain sacrifices. 
Wheeler keeps speaking: 
WHEELER ... to suit their personal desires, and the rest of us have to live with it. 
ANDREW'S POV -- WALTER KENTON: 
KENTON You have to make a decision: is this guy partner material? 
JOE Who makes the rules, Mr. Wheeler? You? 
ANDREW'S POV -- BOB SEIDMAN: 
SEIDMAN Yes, I did see the lesions. I suspected he was sick... 
CLOSE ON ANDREW: closing his eyes. 
THE VOICES GET LOUDER, FIGHTING WITH EACH OTHER: 
WHEELER The everyday, common person with decent values... 
RACHEL It seems like he wasn't willing to face the reality of his situation... 
Andrew slowly rises, the VOICES GETTING LOUDER: 
SEIDMAN I didn't tell the others, I was afraid to... 
WHEELER ... But now, we're standing up for ourselves... 
SEIDMAN ... But we shouldn't have fired him... 
WHEELER ... It's time to get this society back on track! 
Andrew OPENS HIS EYES... WE SWITCH TO HIS POV: 
The Judge, the Jury -- everyone silent, looking concerned. 
ANDREW'S POV of the courtroom floor. 
Andrew falls into his own POV SHOT. In slow motion. 
He lies on the floor, looking up. 
ANDREW'S POV -- Joe steps over him. 
ANDREW Could you call an ambulance, please? 
CUT TO: 
A CRISIS IN A HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./DAY) ... MEDICAL STAFF working frenetically, trying to intubate Andrew, who IS HAVING SERIOUS TROUBLE BREATHING, his body HEAVING. The tube they're trying to put in place seems to be making matters worse. 
Miguel stands to the side, furious: 
MIGUEL It's making it worse. Take it out. Take it out! 
Dr. Gillman RUSHES into the room, in street clothes, obviously having answered an emergency call. She tries assessing the situation, just as the tube is removed and Andrew GASPS for breath. A NURSE places an oxygen mask over Andrew's face and he drinks in the air. His eyes are wide open with fear, sweat covering his face. 
CUT TO: 
PHILADELPHIA CITY HALL, A BUSINESS DAY (EXT./DAY). 
TITLE: "Two weeks later." 
LESBIAN JUROR (VO) If he was "mediocre," why did they gave him this major assignment three weeks before they fired him? 
POSTAL WORKER JUROR (VO) They were testing him. 
OPERA MUSIC FADES IN, TAKING US TO... 
ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING... JOE STEPPING INTO THE CORRIDOR OF a hospital (INT./NIGHT), carrying two shopping bags from the Famous 4th Street deli... 
Joe moves down the corridor, looking for a particular room. 
Dr. Gillman stands outside a hospital room, talking in a low voice to Bud and Sarah Beckett. As Joe passes them, entering Andrew's room, he hears: 
DR. GILLMAN ... if he comes out of the hospital this time, you mustn't expect him to be like he was before... 
Joe steps into... 
ANDREW'S HOSPITAL ROOM (INT./NIGHT) ... 
A hand-painted banner is strung over Andrew's bed: "Victory." 
OPERA MUSIC plays on a portable CD player. ANDREW lies in a hospital bed, with a pressurized oxygen mask on his face. 
JILL sits on the edge of Andrew's bed, holding his hand, smiling, speaking to Andrew in low tones. With his free hand, Andrew gently strokes Jill's forearm. (Andrew has an amazing assortment of tubes and IVs running into various parts of his body.) 
Andrew's brothers MATT and RANDY are sipping beers with REV. JIM, MIGUEL, Miguel's sister MARIA, Bruno and Chandra, while Matt does a dramatic re-creation of the Marine Juror rendering the judgment. Matt's audience is loving it. 
As Joe comes into the room, Jill rises to take the shopping bags from him. Joe exchanges nods and greetings with the others. 
People KEEP THEIR VOICES LOW, but there's a certain energy, and happiness evident in the room. 
ON ANDREW: Watching his friends and relatives with sparkling eyes and a weak, but grateful and peaceful smile. 
ON JOE: Glancing across the room, catching Andrew's look. 
Andrew smiles at Joe and pats his hospital bed, indicating he wants Joe to sit there. 
Joe crosses the room, sits on the edge of the bed. 
With some difficulty, Andrew removes his oxygen mask. His voice is raspy, weak: 
ANDREW What do you call a thousand lawyers chained together at the bottom of the ocean? 
JOE What? 
ANDREW A good start. 
Joe smiles. 
ANDREW (CONT.) Excellent work, Joe. I thank you. 
JOE It was good working with you, Andrew. You're welcome. (sees the oxygen mask) Hey. Shouldn't you put that thing back on? 
Andrew begins fitting the mask back in place, but his hands are weak. Joe helps adjust the straps behind Andrew's ears. 
JOE (CONT.) I better get home. Lisa and I are having some friends over. 
ANDREW (muffled by the mask) Sure thing. 
Joe stands. 
JOE I'll see you, Beckett. 
Andrew nods, weakly. But he's still smiling and his eyes are dancing. 
ANDREW (through mask) Thanks for coming by. 
JOE You bet. We'll see you later. 
Joe heads for the door, meeting Miguel there. 
JOE (to Miguel) He's looking good. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets out of here soon. 
MIGUEL We just want to get him home. Thanks for stopping by, Joe. 
Miguel puts his arms around Joe and hugs him. Joe slaps Miguel's back. 
JOE Night. 
Joe leaves. 
Miguel begins circulating among the "guests," saying: 
MIGUEL He's tired. He ought to sleep. 
CONTINUOUS CUT TO: 
JOE STEPPING INTO THE HOSPITAL ELEVATOR (INT./NIGHT), AND saying to a GROUP OF DOCTORS and NURSES:

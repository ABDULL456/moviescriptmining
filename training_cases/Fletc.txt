FLETCH 
FADE IN 
EXT.CALIFORNIA BEACH – DAY 1Seagulls squawk, and the waves pound, but we’re not talking about Malibu Colony, here. This is a fairly rundown beach area, catering to lower-echelon surfers, vagrants, and strung out druggies of all ages, several of whom stand or sit on their haunches by a dilapidated old hamburger stand. Over the stand is a faded sign: "FAT SAM’S HAMBURGERS". A simple but haunting electronic melody plays in the b.g. 
INT. "FAT SAM’S" – DAY 2Seated just inside the stand on a folding aluminum chair is a chubby man in his late thirties. He’s wearing a stained valor sweat suit and a cap. This is Fat Sam. He’s a dealer. Seated on the sand next to him is Fletch, a rangy man, early thirties, in jeans and a Magic Johnson T-shirt, nodding idly on a battered Casio music machine which he treats lovingly. This is the source of the title music. FLETCH So what do you figure? FAT SAM No idea. FLETCH No idea at all? FAT SAM Okay. Some idea. FLETCH Like when? FAT SAM Like tonight. FLETCH For sure? FAT SAM No, not for sure. When it comes, it comes. You gonna want some $hit? FLETCH I think I’d rather have drugs.

FAT SAM 
(shakes head and smiles) 
Fletch… 
FLETCH 
Sorry. I find a little humor really brightens 
things up around here, don’t you? 
A young junkie with a black eye – Gummy – passes. 
GUMMY 
Hi Sam. Hi Fletch. 
FLETCH 
Hi Gummy. How’s the eye? 
GUMMY 
It’s okay. The cops did it. 
FLETCH 
I know. 
GUMMY 
They busted me last week. 
FLETCH 
They bust you every week. 
GUMMY 
I know. I got bad luck or something. 
STANWYK (shakes his hand) Alan Stanwyk. 
FLETCH Charmed. 
9 EXT. BERMAN STREET - BEVERLY HILLS - DAY 
---A Jaguar XJ sedan goes up Berman Street, a dead end.  Fletch's hand reaches out ---of the passenger window and empties sand out of a sneaker. 
10 INT. JAGURE - DAY 
FLETCH I always liked this part of town. 
11 EXT. BERMAN STREET - DAY 
---The Jaguar continues on up Berman Street, stopping before massive iron gates ---marked PRIVATE PROPERTY -- NO TRESPASSING -- STANWYK. The gates open ---electronically. 
12 EXT. STANWYK HOUSE - DAY 
---The jaguar goes up the center of the drive toward a white-pillared mansion. The ---lawns and planting are spectacular. 
13 INT. JAGUAR - DAY 
---Fletch stares out the window. 
FLETCH What a coincidence. 
---The car stops before the house. 
STANWYK What? 
14 EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
---as they get out of the car. 
FLETCH I came this close... (holds fingers slightly apart) ...to buying this place 
---Stanwyk ignores Fletch and starts toward the house. Fletch follows. 
FLETCH Then I found out Hopalong Cassidy had shot himself in the game room. That just blew it for me. 
STANWYK Who? 
FLETCH Hopalong Cassidy. Killed himself here. Bow and arrow. Strange. 
---Stanwyk stops before the front door, stares at Fletch 
STANWYK What are you, doped up or something? 
---Fletch abruptly changes gears, stares at Stanwyk 
FLETCH I don't work for you yet, assface. Don't talk to me like that. 
STANWYK (after a beat) Come inside. 
15 INT. HOUSE - DAY 
---Stanwyk and Fletch enter. A Mexican Maid crosses. 
STANWYK Buenas dias. 
MAID Buenas dias. 
She disappeared. 
FLETCH I commend you on your Spanish. 
---Stanwyk doesn't reply, keeps on walking. He opens a set of double doors to the ---left of the winding staircase, then stands to one side, indicating that Fletch ---should enter. 
16 INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
---Massive fireplace. Everything built in teak. Fletch enters, and Stanwyk closes ---the door behind them. 
FLETCH Ahh, the library. Masculine but sensitive. 
---Stanwyk wordlessly goes behind the desk 
FLETCH Really, I love what you've done with the place. Must have cost you...hundreds. 
---Stanwyk turns, looks out a pair of French doors behind his desk, then turns ---back. 
STANWYK (goes on, unresponsive) I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves? 
FLETCH I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy. 
STANWYK In this drawer.... 
---He opens the top drawer of his desk 
32 INSIDE THE DRAWER 
---an enormous .357 Magnum. 
33 MASTER 
---Stanwyk holds up the gun. 
34 FLETCH 
FLETCH A .357. 
35 MASTER 
STANWYK Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray. 
FLETCH So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you. 
STANWYK Precisely. Are you a good shot? 
FLETCH (looking at the huge gun) What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first. 
STANWYK Get me on the first shot, if you can. 
FLETCH I don't think you'll have to worry about that. 
---A beat. Stanwyk stares at Fletch. 
STANWYK Do you have a passport? 
FLETCH Sure, all drifters do. 
STANWYK Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment. 
FLETCH Take it where? 
---Stanwyk starts to write down the information on a note pad. 
STANWYK LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you. 
FLETCH Where am I going? 
STANWYK (hands Fletch the note) Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM. 
FLETCH They serve dinner on the flight? 
STANWYK It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Fletcher. 
FLETCH You've certainly thought this out, haven't you? 
STANWYK I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Fletcher. 
FLETCH You sure those doors will be open? 
STANWYK Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else. 
FLETCH The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying. 
STANWYK That's right. 
FLETCH You sure got the hard part. 
STANWYK What do you say, Mr. Fletcher? You'll be doing me and my family a great service. 
36 FLETCH 
---thinking it over. 
37 STANWYK 
STANWYK Will you kill me? 
DR. DOLEN Joan or Margaret Smith. 
FLETCH Right. 
DR. DOLEN Well, which one? 
FLETCH Margaret. 
DR. DOLEN Funny old bird. 
FLETCH Is she ever. I've got some stories.... 
DR. DOLEN I'll bet. Shame about Ed. 
FLETCH (vamping) It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly. 
DR. DOLEN Oh, he was dying for years. 
FLETCH Sure, but the end was so sudden. 
DR. DOLEN He was in intensive care for eight weeks. 
FLETCH Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden. (quickly) You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy. 
DR. DOLEN Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar. 
FLETCH Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that.... 
DR. DOLEN Just relax.... 
FLETCH Honest, I feel fine. You better be married. 
Fletch looks alarmed as Dolan pushes him into position. Dolan puts on a plastic glove. 
53 CLOSE - FLETCH 
FLETCH Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh -- (as Dolan starts to probe from behind) Ever serve time? 
DR. DOLEN Breathe easy.... 
FLETCH Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family. 
DR. DOLEN (noncommittally) There is? 
FLETCH Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist? 
DR. DOLEN Just relax. 
FLETCH (reacts to a poke) Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right? 
DR. DOLEN I can't discuss another patient. You know that. (rising into frame and washing up) Well, I can't find anything wrong with you. 
FLETCH I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you? 
DR. DOLEN Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now. 
FLETCH I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove? 
DR. DOLEN Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements. 
FLETCH Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant. 
54 INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Fletch is dressed in shorts, a clean shirt, and is carrying a doctor's bag. He is wearing a stethoscope around his neck , has a beeper on, a lot of pencils and other doctor gadgets. He's standing at the directory 
55 DIRECTORY 
Combing it with his eyes, he sees the directory: 
PATHOLOGY - THIRD FLOOR B. ROSENSTIEN, M.D. H. ROSENBLATT, M.D. P. ROSENWOHL, M.D. 
Fletch goes to a door marked "Stairs." 
56 INT. STAIRWELL - DAY 
Fletch abruptly empties his doctor's bag and puts on a long green gown, a cap and a face mask. He plugs the stethoscope in his ears, removes miscellaneous file folders filled with papers, closes the bag, and heads for Pathology. 
57 INT PATHOLOGY DEPARTMENT - DAY 
There's Fletch, his hair in an Afro, dressed in Laker gold. He's on the receiving end of a Jabbar pass, making an easy layup. 
HEARN (V.O.) Gosh, he makes it look so easy! 
75 FLETCH 
asleep, smiling. 
77 PRICATICE COURT - DAY 
Gail Stanwyk is on the other side of the net, loading tennis balls into the automatic serve machine. She is in her late twenties and quite attractive., but in a much more natural way than other women we see here. She is good natured and effervescent. Fletch steps up to the entrance of the court. 
FLETCH Gail Stanwyk! 
She looks up. He enters the court with great delight. 
FLETCH (continuing) I haven't seen you since the wedding, Jeez, you look great. 
MRS. STANWYK (genuinely pleased) I do? Oh, isn't that sweet, thank you. I have to confess something to you. I must have been pretty plowed at your wedding. I really don't have the faintest idea who you are. 
FLETCH Huh? No, not my wedding. Yours. 
MRS. STANWYK Oh, mine! Thank God. (furrows her brow) Actually, that doesn't make it any better, does it? Are you a friend of Alan's? 
FLETCH We used to fly together. I'm...John. 
MRS. STANWYK (snaps her fingers in happy recognition) John! You used to fly together! 
Her smile segues right into an "I'm sorry, bit I give up" expression. 
MRS. STANWYK John who? 
FLETCH John Ultrarelamensky. 
MRS. STANWYK (bursts out in laughter) Oh, I'm sorry. It's a beautiful name, really. 
FLETCH It's Scotch-Rumanian. 
MRS. STANWYK (still loading tennis balls) That's a strange combination. 
FLETCH So were my parents. 
MRS. STANWYK Mind if I keep practicing? I need to work on my ground stroke a little. 
FLETCH Please. 
As Mrs. Stanwyk crosses to the other side of the net, a waiter approaches Fletch. 
WAITER Excuse me sir. Are you a guest of the club? 
FLETCH Yes, I'm with the Underhills. 
WAITER They just left, sir. 
FLETCH They'll be back. He had to go in for a urinalysis. 
WAITER Would you care for a drink while you're waiting? I can put it on the Underhill bill. 
FLETCH Great. I'll have a Bloody Mary and a steak sandwich. 
WAITER Very good sir. 
The Waiter leaves, and Fletch watches as Mrs. Stanwyk tries to return the serving machine's serves. She swings so goofily that she can't even get the racket on the ball. She has clearly never taken a lesson in her life, and it is doubtful if she will ever make contact with a tennis ball in this century. 
MRS. STANWYK Damn, I thought I had that one. 
FLETCH You should play with much larger tennis balls. So how's Alan? 
MRS. STANWYK What are you asking me for? He's so busy lately I hardly see him. And he's been so preoccupied. 
FLETCH Preoccupied with what? 
MRS. STANWYK Oh, personal stuff. Look! I hit one! 
Indeed, she has. Strait up. She and Fletch crane their necks upward to follow it's flight. 
FLETCH Good. Lobs are a very important part of the game. 
She completely misses the next one. 
FLETCH I feel like dirt. They even want to know what he's doing in Utah? 
BOYD Utah? (laughs) Jesus Christ! First of all, Alan Stanwyk does not own one share of stock.The three million dollars for the ranch in Provo comes from my daughter who converted some of her personal holdings, not company holdings. Now if anybody in DC wants to make something of that, bring 'em on. Until then, get the hell out of my face. 
FLETCH (stands and closes briefcase) God I admire you. 
BOYD By the way: what kind of name is Poon? 
FLETCH Comanche Indian. 
80 ALAN STANWYK'S OFFICE - DAY 
Fletch breezes in, right up to the Secretary, whose nameplate reads MADELINE TURNER. 
FLETCH (rapidly) Oh, Margie, sorry, Frieda lost the number of Alan's realtor in Provo. Can you give it to me real quick? 
MARGIE Jim Swarthout? 
FLETCH Yeah. 
She writes it out for him. 
MARGIE And, I'm sorry, who are you again? 
FLETCH (grabbing the paper) Frieda's boss. 
MARGIE (calling after him) Who's Frieda? 
FLETCH (out the door) My secretary. 
81 EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Pan across the beach.... 
FLETCH (O.S.) Larry, it's me.... 
Fletch is in a phone booth on the sidewalk next to the beach, keeping an eye on "Fat Sam's." 
FLETCH See if you've got anything in Stanwyk's background from when he lived in Utah. Also check on a realtor in Provo named Swarthout. And tell Frank I'm crazy about him and I'd like to discuss his maybe moving in with me. 
We hear police sirens. Fletch looks O.S. 
FLETCH Later. 
He hangs up. 
82 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - FOUR SQUAD CARS 
have pulled up to the beach, lights flashing. The druggies are dispersing. Creasy is running towards Fletch. 
CREASY Fletch! Take off! 
83 FLETCH 
He steps out onto the beach, and starts towards the cops. 
84 MASTER 
CREASY What are you doing? 
85 MASTER 
Everyone is scattering. The cops run past everyone, and approach Gummey. 
86 FLETCH AND CREASY 
FLETCH They're after Gummy again. It's weird. 
Fletch keeps moving toward the police. 
CREASY (out of breath) Fletch, slow down. 
87 GUMMY AND THE COPS 
Gummy trips and falls in the sand. A Cop kicks him in the head. 
COP #1 Let's go, Gummy. 
88 FLETCH AND CREASY 
FLETCH Gummy and two cops.... 
and OMITTED 
104 INT. FRANK WALKER'S OFFICE - DAY 
FLETCH Cool your tool, Frank, I need a little more time. I think I'm really on to something here. 
WALKER Your onto something. That's good. What? 
FLETCH I really don't want to spoil your surprise, Frank. Why don't you read it tomorrow? 
Larry, knocks on the door. 
WALKER What do you want? 
Larry points to Fletch. 
WALKER Speak, don't point! 
LARRY I need Fletch for a second. 
FLETCH She needs me, Frank. 
Fletch turns to Larry. Push to two shot. 
LARRY Nothing on Gail Stanwyk, nothing on Jim Swarthout. But I did --- 
FLETCH That's okay, Lar. I gotta put this on the back burner for a while. 
Larry starts to exit. 
WALKER Just give me a hint, all right? 
FLETCH All right. Maybe there are some crooked cops involved in all this. 
LARRY (stopping in the doorway) Did you say cops? 
FLETCH Yeah. 
LARRY That's one thing I did find. It's from Last month, so it was in the unsorted pile. 
She hands Fletch a clipping. 
105 INSERT - CLIPPING 
It is an article and photograph of the newly-appointed citizens on the Police Advisory Board. One of them is Alan Stanwyk. 
WALKER What's that? 
106 MASTER 
Fletch pockets the photo. 
FLETCH (puzzled) More cops. (then) I think I gotta go to Utah, Frank. 
WALKER Utah? 
FLETCH Yeah. It's wedged in between Wyoming and Nevada. I'm sure you've seen pictures. 
WALKER What about finding the source? 
FLETCH I have some ideas. 
WALKER Who? Donnie and Marie? 
FLETCH Very possibly. Come on, say yes. I'll buy you a shirt. 
WALKER Go to transportation, get a ticket. 
LARRY (to Fletch as he exits) My hero. 
FLETCH Nothing to it. 
107 EXT. PROVO, UTAH - AIRPORT -DAY 
A Western Airlines flight arrives. 
107-A EXT. HIGHWAY - DUSK 
FLETCH Roll over. Play dead. Good boy. 
Fletch now grabs hold of the eave on the side of the house, and very carefully pulls himself onto it. It's only about ten feet from there to the vulnerable window, but the angle of the eave is rather steep, and the going is treacherous. As he makes his way, he keeps a wary eye on the dog who keeps leaping up, seemingly getting closer and closer to taking a giant bite out of Fletch's backside. 
FLETCH You any relation to Doctor Dolan? 
Now he's at the window. He tries to open it, but despite it's warped appearance from the ground, it is locked. Fletch looks at the lock and can't believe it. He sighs. He shakes his head. He smashes the window with his elbow. 
FLETCH I hate this. 
He climbs into the darkened house, leaving the enraged dog to run furiously around the fenced in yard that surrounds the house. 
123 INT SWARTHOUT'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT 
Fletch tiptoes though the upstairs bedroom and down the stairs. From outside, he can still hear the dog snarling and barking. 
124 INT. SWARTHOUT'S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT 
As Fletch passes through the living room he sees the dog snarling at him through the living room window. 
125 INT. SWARTHOUT'S DEN - NIGHT 
Fletch enters and looks around. 
The dog is now outside the den window. 
FLETCH Make sure nobody comes in, okay? 
He goes to the file cabinet and opens it. 
He flips through the "S" section. "Stanwyk". He pulls it. He thumbs through various documents until he finds what he's looking for. A copy of a deed. He pulls it out. 
125-A INSERT - DEED - CLOSE ON THE PURCHASE PRICE 
Three Thousand Dollars. 
FLETCH (O.S.) So much for your three million dollar ranch. 
126 FLETCH 
takes out a tiny document camera -- the kind spies use in the movies -- and loads it fumblingly. Then he props the deed up on top of the file cabinet, and moves a lamp into position to light it. Just as he snaps his first shot, we hear a terrible crashing sound. 
127 WINDOW 
The murderous Doberman has made a crashing leap right through the den window, sending glass flying everywhere, and he streaks across the room to rip Fletch into bite-sized shreds. 
128 MASTER 
Fletch bolts and the dog flies into the file cabinet, knocking it over, scattering all the files over the floor. Fletch dashes for the nearest door, and runs through it just as the dog slams into it. 
129 INT. KITCHEN 
Fletch is now holed up in the kitchen, panting to catch his breath, feeling the full course of adrenaline pumping through his terrified veins. He sees that he can get to his car by climbing through the window. But in order to get to the window he has to let go of the door, and that would allow the dog to get in. 
Looking around frantically, holding the door shut against the furious slamming of the dog, he reaches for and finally grabs a mop which he props under the door knob, thus keeping the door shut. Letting go of the door gingerly, he satisfies himself that the dog cannot get in, and he makes his break for the window. 
He vaults up onto the counter top and is just about to break the window when he sees that the dog's continued efforts are about to result in opening the door. 
Fletch knows he has only seconds. Standing on top of the counter, he opens the door of the restaurant-sized refrigerator next to him, and just as the snarling dog bursts into the room Fletch starts hurling food at it. A pot roast, sliced turkey with stuffing, a couple of filet mignons. The dog is momentarily distracted. Fletch pours a large bucket of cranberry sauce on the dog. 
FLETCH Suck on this Cujo! 
Then he dumps an equally large bucket of mashed potatoes. With the dog temporarily vision-impaired, Fletch bolts. 
130 EXT. SWARTHOUT HOUSE - NIGHT 
Fletch runs as fast as humanly possible towards his car, fishing for his keys as he goes. The dog -- having shaken off the people-food from his hateful face -- is seconds behind and closing. 
Fletch makes it to his car, hops inside, and slams the door just as the dog leaps furiously at the windshield. 
131 INT. FLETCH'S CAR 
Fletch makes it to his car, huffing and puffing. The dog jumps across the closed window, snarling and bug-eyed with hatred. 
Fletch smiles, waves at the dog, and starts taking its picture with his little camera. 
FLETCH Gimme a smile! There you go...oh, that's a nice one... (starting the car) Everything's fine, now...go take a little nap.... 
Fletch is ready to pull out, but the dog is still leaping madly at the window. Fletch points back to the house. 
FLETCH Fletch F. Fletch 
CUMMINGS (skeptical but patient) I see. And what do you do for a living, Mr. Fletch? 
FLETCH I'm President of the International Fletch Corporation. 
Cummings just stares at Fletch. 
CUMMINGS Why are you doing this Mr. Fletch? 
FLETCH Frankly sir, you look a little like my father. Probaly explains the curious feeling of love I have for you. 
CUMMINGS For a gentleman who was just found holding a bag full of heroin.... 
FLETCH It was planted on me, sir. 
CUMMINGS We're looking at five years, maybe ten. Is that what you want...Jane Doe? 
He suddenly kicks Fletch's chair out from under him. Fletch falls to the floor. 
CUMMINGS Your editor called me yesterday to respond to allegations you're about to print about police involvement in narcotics dealing. 
Fletch starts to get up, but Cummings plants his foot on Fletch's chest, forces him back down. 
CUMMINGS I'm about to break that beach wide open, and I don't need some pennyante Woodward and Bernstein getting in the way of my men. 
FLETCH 'Your men' might just be involved in all this. 
CUMMINGS You idiot. Off the record, deep background: I've got that beach crawling with undercover cops. 
Cummings picks Fletch up, and holds him by the lapels. 
CUMMINGS If you keep nosing around, you make the bad guys just a little bit more cautious. That makes my job harder. And if you print your story this week, you might get some of my men killed. I can't let that happen, Mr. Fletch. 
He throws Fletch against the wall of celebrity photos, some of which fall to the floor. 
CUMMINGS You go back to that goddamn beach, I swear to God I'll make you regret it. 
FLETCH (picks up a picture) Hey, you and Tommy Lasorda. That's great. 
Fletch takes the picture and hurls it across the room. It smashes into the opposite wall and shatters. 
FLETCH I don't like Tommy Lasorda. 
and OMITTED 
140 JAIL CORRIDOR 
Fletch is tossed into an empty cell by the two Cops who brought him in. Cummings watches. The two Cops leave, and we see that all the cells in this corridor are empty. 
FLETCH You can't keep me here. 
CUMMINGS Maybe I'm not going to keep you here. (takes out a gun) Maybe I'm gonna blow your brains out. 
FLETCH I'm no lawyer, but I do believe that's a violation of my rights. 
The Chief takes a knife out of his pocket, holding it with a handkerchief. 
CUMMINGS After I shoot you, I stick the knife in my arm, then place it in your dead hand. Self-defense. We don't do this very much anymore...but we have. Got rid of a lot of minorities that way. 
FLETCH My God, you're serious. 
CUMMINGS Ask anybody. 
FLETCH Can I ask anybody now? 
Cummings looks down the corridor. Deserted. 
FLETCH Can I call my Mom? I'd like to tell here how much I've always loved her. 
CUMMINGS (cocks the gun) What'll it be Fletch? 
Fletch looks in Cummings' eyes. They are steely and cold. He is quite serious. 
FLETCH I hate the beach. Wouldn't go there if you paid me. Besides, I'm way overdue on my story about off-track betting in the Himalayas. You don't think it's the mafia, do you? 
CUMMINGS (opening the cell) Its been very nice meeting you. I enjoy your column. 
Fletch walks out of the cell. Cummings walks with him through the empty corridor to the exit. 
154 OMITTED and 
156 EXT. CABANA ONE 
A little Spanish bungalow-type affair. Old California money-style elegance. Fletch rings the bell. 
MRS. STANWYK (V.O.) Who is it? 
FLETCH It's John. John... (forgets name) Znhcneelsky. 
MRS. STANWYK John Ultramalensky? 
She opens the door, clad only in a towel. A towel is wrapped around her head. She seems surprised, but not displeased, to see Fletch. She also seems a little at a loss for words. 
FLETCH Hi. 
MRS. STANWYK (finally) Hi. 
FLETCH I was hoping you'd say that. 
They have just shaken hands, and Fletch notices his hand is now sopping wet. 
MRS. STANWYK Uh...I'm just out of the shower. 
FLETCH Can I borrow your towel for a minute? 
She laughs a nervous little laugh. There is a bit of sexual tension here. 
MRS. STANWYK I'm sorry, I'm just surprised to see you. I didn't think...What do you want? 
FLETCH I ordered lunch. 
MRS. STANWYK You ordered it here? 
FLETCH Well, I knew this is where my mouth would be. 
MRS. STANWYK Down boy. 
With a nervous glance in both directions, she lets him in and closes the door behind them. 
157 INT. CABANA 
They stand there for a few seconds looking at each other. 
MRS. STANWYK I really should change. 
FLETCH No, I think you should stay the same wonderful person you are today. 
MRS. STANWYK I mean put clothes on. 
FLETCH Here, take mine. 
He starts to take off his shirt. She is amused, and responds playfully, but firmly. 
MRS. STANWYK Stop that! 
He does. 
MRS. STANWYK Have you gotten cuter since I last saw you? 
FLETCH Yes. 
She stands there, looking around, trying to act as if her heartbeat weren't speeding up. 
SFX: Knock at door. 
FLETCH Lunch.... 
MRS. STANWYK God.... 
She goes sprinting into the bathroom. 
FLETCH Come on in. 
The door opens. A second Waiter, Mexican, solemnly wheels in a cart bearing the goodies ordered by Fletch. The twin bottle of Dom Perignon juts from a silver ice bucket. 
WAITER You want I set up? 
FLETCH No thanks, I'll do it. Give yourself twenty dollars. Underhill. 
MRS. STANWYK He never sees them and I never met them. 
FLETCH How come? 
SFX: Insistent knock at door. 
Fletch and Mrs. Stanwyk freeze. 
MRS. STANWYK Yes? 
MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Mrs. Stanwyk, I hate to disturb you. Tom Underhill here...I'm a new member. 
Fletch rises. 
FLETCH Thanks for the great time. 
MRS. STANWYK (sotto voice) What is this? 
FLETCH Long story. 
MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Apparently, someone of your acquaintance has charged the most extraordinary lunch to my bill. 
MRS. STANWYK (hissing) John! 
Fletch starts pushing the lunch table towards the bathroom. 
MRS. STANWYK You don't know the Underhills? 
MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) I'd appreciate an opportunity to discuss this with you. 
MRS. STANWYK I just stepped out of the shower! Can you give me a minute? 
MR. UNDERHILL (V.O.) Of course. 
Mrs. Stanwyk follows Fletch into the bathroom. 
160 INT BATHROOM 
Fletch jams the cart into the bathroom. 
FLETCH Take one end. 
Mrs. Stanwyk lifts one side of the cart. They lift it and put it up into the bathtub. There's a window in the bathroom. Fletch opens it. 
FLETCH I'll be leaving now, Mrs. Stanwyk. 
MRS. STANWYK I think you should call me Gail, now. 
FLETCH Gail. I hope this won't embarrass you in any way. I think Underhill's a yutz, you won't have any trouble with him. 
MRS. STANWYK Why did you do it? 
Fletch shrugs, smiles. 
MRS. STANWYK A four hundred dollar lunch tab! 
FLETCH Yeah. 
MRS. STANWYK I'll cover it. You have any other surprises? 
FLETCH (after a beat) Yeah. My name's not John Ultramalensky and I wasn't at your wedding. 
She stares at him. 
MRS. STANWYK Who. 
FLETCH Irwin Fletcher. I write a newspaper column under the name Jane Doe. 
A long beat. 
MRS. STANWYK So? 
FLETCH So, your husband hired me to kill him. That's the truth. 
MRS. STANWYK What are you talking about? 
FLETCH That's what I want to know. 
161 EXT. CABANA 
Gail opens the door where Mr. Underhill has been waiting. 
MRS. STANWYK Sorry. Here. (grabs the bill from his hand) Thanks. Bye. 
She closes the door in his face.

165 EXT. BOYD AVIATION - PARKING LOT 
Alan Stanwyk crosses the parking lot and gets into his Jaguar. He starts the engine, backs out of his reserved space, and pulls out of the lot. 
166 ANOTHER ANGLE - PARKING LOT 
Fletch is reading a copy of Sports Illustrated. He puts it down, starts his car, and pulls out of the lot. 
167 SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD 
Stanwyk's Jaguar tools down Santa Monica Boulevard. Fletch's car follows, several discreet car lengths behind. 
168 INT. JAGUAR 
Stanwyk checks his watch, and makes a turn. 
169 MASTER 
Stanwyk has pulled into a service station. He gets out of his car and opens the trunk. 
170 FLETCH 
He pulls into a fast-food joint on the west side of the street. He opens the Sports Illustrated and peers over it. 
171 STANWYK 
He takes a gas can from the trunk, goes to the pump, fills it, and pays the attendant in cash. 
172 FLETCH 
Curious. 
173 STANWYK 
He puts the gas can back in the trunk, gets into the car, and starts off. 
174 FLETCH 
follows suit. 
175 SANTA MONICA BOULEVARD 
We are getting into the increasingly rundown section of Santa Monica. The Jaguar turns off. Hold: Several beats later, Fletch turns off. 
176 OVERPASS 
A freeway overpass. Stanwyk stops his car. 
177 FLETCH'S CAR 
He pulls off behind a liquor store, in view of the overpass. Fletch waits. 
178 OVERPASS 
A second car pulls up behind Stanwyk's. A cop steps out and says something to Stanwyk. Stanwyk gets out of his car and walks over to the unmarked police car, and gets in. 
178-A FLETCH 
takes out his binoculars. 
178-B FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW 
Because he's looking through the reflection of sunlight on the back window of the unmarked police car, Fletch's point of view is fuzzy, but we can just make out the form of someone else in animated conversation with Stanwyk. 
178-C FLETCH 
A moment of possible recognition. He focuses intently. 
178-D FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - THE OTHER MAN IN THE CAR 
with Stanwyk...is Police Chief Cummings. 
TEENAGER Okay, okay, just stop, will you. I admit it. I stole it. I was just taking it for a little joy ride, that's all.... 
FLETCH Holy sh*t. 
191-B EXT. CAR 
Fletch squeals around a corner, runs a light, and booms into the parking lot of a large Holiday Inn. He's a few seconds ahead of the cops. 
FLETCH Okay, kid. Just stand here with your hands on the car and wait for the cops. I gotta pee. Here, take my hat. 
Fletch pops his hat on the kid's head, and runs off. 
192 EXT. HOLIDAY INN 
Fletch runs into the kitchen entrance of the Holiday Inn. 
193 INT. HOLIDAY INN KITCHEN 
Fletch picks up a case of vegetables and walks through as if he belonged there. 
Moments later, two cops enter. 
194 THE COPS 
can't see him because of the crate. 
195 INT. HOLIDAY INN - BANQUET ROOM 
A testimonial dinner is in progress. A sign on the wall reads: 
TRB SYSTEMS SALUTES FRED DORFMAN 40 YEARS OF SERVICE 
Thirty tables of conservatively dressed, older men and women are enjoying lunch. Fletch enters from the kitchen followed by several waiters and busboys. He looks over his shoulder. 
196 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - KITCHEN 
Two cops are in hot pursuit. 
197 FLETCH 
moves into the middle of the tables as a florid fat Speaker at the dais drones on. 
SPEAKER ...and he can truly be called the Father of Internal Bushings. 
A round of applause which Fletch joins heartily, as he quickly sits in the audience at an empty seat at a table in the center. 
FLETCH (to his table) Hello. I'm with the hotel catering. Are you enjoying your meal? Carrots overcooked? 
Fletch looks to the kitchen entrance and sees two cops scanning the crowd. One signals to the opposite door. 
198 DOOR 
Four more cops converge, looking for Fletch. Distant sirens indicate even more. 
199 MASTER 
SPEAKER And now a man who needs no further introduction.... 
The police spot Fletch and start moving forward. Fletch stands up. A spotlight swings onto him. 
FLETCH Thank you, Tony, thank you. As a lifelong friend of.... (looks at banner) ...Fred Dorfman, I'm thrilled to be here. 
200 DIAS 
Fred Dorfman turns to the people on either side of him and whispers, obviously wondering who the hell this guy is. 
201 FLETCH 
The cops are hesitant to move in. They wait for Fletch to finish and get out of the light. 
FLETCH Many of you are probably not aware of Freddie's lifelong commitment to honoring a profession that frequently goes unsung -- the police. Many times Fred used to forsake a night with his wife and children to go out an sell tickets for the Policemen's Benevolent Association. 
202 POLICE 
look at each other, sensing a trick, and start to move in. 
203 FLETCH 
going for broke. 
This is all news to Fletch, but he covers his surprise. 
FLETCH Isn't that nice. Since when? 
MARVIN Since he moved to L.A. 
Fletch is very interested in all this. 
FLETCH Forgive me now for seeming personal, but we understand that there is a lady friend he sees here in Provo. 
MARVIN What the hell does this have to do with insurance? 
FLETCH Trust me, sir. It's a comprehensive policy. 
MARVIN Well, you can forget about that lady friend business, Alan's the most loyal husband a girl could have. He dotes on that bride of his. 
VELMA Cute young thing, too. 
FLETCH I'm sorry? 
VELMA His bride. Cute as a button. 
FLETCH You've met her? 
MARVIN Well, of course we have. He brings her with him. 
Fletch is getting very puzzled and very concerned about all this. 
FLETCH Has Alan ever mentioned the name Sally Ann Cavanaugh? 
Marvin and Velma exchange the oddest of glances between them. 
FLETCH Has he? 
MARVIN Boy, what the hell's the matter with you? 
FLETCH Then he has. 
MARVIN Course he has. That's his wife. 
You could knock Fletch over with a straw. Again, he quickly recovers. 
FLETCH Of course, his wife's name is Sally Ann Cavanaugh? 
VELMA Cute thing. 
FLETCH (starting to sweat a little) Do you happen to have a picture of Alan and his wife? 
VELMA Oh, we've got lots of pictures. Let me show you some. 
Velma rummages through a family album on a side table as Fletch tried to sort all this out in his mind. She brings a photo over to him. He looks at it. 
223 INSERT - PHOTO 
It's a wedding photo of Alan and a woman we have not seen. She is brunette and quite unlike Gail. Alan wears a similar sh*t-eating grin, and makes a similar thumbs-up gesture to the wedding photo with Gail that Fletch saw in Boyd's office. 
224 FLETCH 
He sighs. 
FLETCH And they're still married...Alan and Sally Ann. 
MARVIN Of course they are. 
VELMA She's cute as a button. 
FLETCH How long have they been married? 
MARVIN Lets see, it was before he moved to L.A...four years April. 
FLETCH Mrs. Stanwyk, may I borrow this picture. I promise to send it back to you. It's routine, really. The actuarial people need to --- 
VELMA Oh, that's all right, I've got lots more. Want to see the reception? 
FLETCH (rising) No, thank you. 
VELMA How about Marvin's sixty-fifth birthday party? 
Exit Fletch. 
MRS. STANWYK Oh God, I hate things that start like that.... 
FLETCH Gail, please. 
She sits in a chair. he hands her the wedding photo. 
FLETCH I got this from Alan's parents. By the way, they see him all the time. 
First she looks at Fletch with puzzlement. Then, she looks at the photo and can't seem to decide what to think of it. But she knows it's bad. 
MRS. STANWYK What is this.... 
FLETCH I checked. There was no divorce. 
MRS. STANWYK Are you telling me my husband is a bigamist??? 
FLETCH I'm telling you he's not your husband at all. 
She is stunned. 
FLETCH And they're leaving the country tomorrow night. 
MRS. STANWYK (rocked) Bastard. 
FLETCH I don't have all the pieces yet, but I'm close. I'll know tomorrow. 
MRS. STANWYK I'm calling the police. Right now. 
FLETCH You cant do that. 
MRS. STANWYK Don't tell me I can't --- 
FLETCH They're trying to kill me! 
She is taken aback by that, but there is a determination in her eyes. 
MRS. STANWYK Your twenty-four hours are up, Fletch. 
She starts for the phone, but he stops her. 
FLETCH You're going to have to trust me, Gail. You have to. Now listen to me: he's expecting you to go to your meeting tomorrow night. Do it. Stay out of the house. 
There is a long beat. 
MRS. STANWYK I'm terrified. 
FLETCH Come here. 
He puts his arms around her and holds her tight against him. After a few seconds she raises her head and turns the hug into a kiss. Then the kiss turns passionate. 
DISSOLVE TO 
233 FRISBEE 
sails across the surf. 
234 EXT. BEACH - DAY - WIDER 
The usual scene-- a mix of teeny-boppers, junkies and surfers. Into the f.g. step a couple of "surfers." They're wearing wet suits and carrying surfboards, but they're obviously cops. They sit down. Across the beach, a Sufi, dressed in a turban and flowing garments, crosses the sand. 
SURFER COP A Sufi junkie. 
The cops laugh derisively and turn their attention else-where. 
235 CLOSER ON SUFI 
It's Fletch. he's got a beard pasted on, and nervously scans the beach. 
236 FLETCH'S POINT OF VIEW - GUMMY 
is seated on a towel. 
237 MASTER 
Fletch sits near, but not next to, Gummy. 
FLETCH Gum? 
Gummy looks around. 
FAT SAM Thought so. What for? 
FLETCH For me. I'm a reporter, Sam. I'm breaking the drug story and I got the chief red-handed. Gummy game me a deposition. 
FAT SAM (smiles) You gonna nail the chief? 
FLETCH I'm gonna nail the chief. And you can help or --- 
FAT SAM Oh, I'll help, Fletch. I'm a slave to that sonofabitch. He busted me, third offense, gave me a choice: Work for him or do fifteen long. All I get out of this is free snort. 
FLETCH You don't have a piece of the action? 
FAT SAM Noooo. Free snort. That's it. 
FLETCH (hands him a card) Wait five minutes, and go to my office. You'll get federal protection after that. 
FAT SAM Gonna need it. That boy is dangerous. Fletch? 
FLETCH What? 
FAT SAM You find the source? 
FLETCH Gum thought Brazil. 
FAT SAM Rio. Know how he gets it in the country? Some big shot airline executive flies it in on company jets. Very impressive operation, Fletch. Very impressive. 
and OMITTED 
241 INT. NEWSPAPER - CITY ROOM 
Fletch parades through the city room, still in his Sufi getup. He takes off the beard and heads for Frank Walker's office. Fat Sam and Gummy, looking like fish out of water, follow him. 
242 WALKER'S OFFICE 
Fletch marches in with Sam and Gummy. Walker gawks at him. 
WALKER Fletch.... 
Fletch takes off the turban. 
FLETCH I'm quitting, Frank. As of midnight tonight. 
WALKER What? (stares at Fat Sam and Gummy) Who the hell are they? 
FLETCH This is Fat Sam, and this is Gummy. (hands two sheets of paper to Walker) 
WALKER What.... 
FLETCH Their statements, naming Chief Cummings as the numero uno drug pusher from here to Oxnard. I want them to have federal protection under the paper's sponsorship. 
Walker just stares at the sheets. 
WALKER Jesus H. Christ. (smiles) Fletch, this is the greatest. 
FAT SAM He's some reporter, this guy. 
FLETCH I'm out, Frank. You lost faith in me. 
WALKER Fletch, I got nervous. Please.... 
FLETCH Forget it. 
Fletch takes off his robe and drops it to the floor. Beneath the robes he's wearing cutoffs and a Bob McAdoo t-shirt. 
FLETCH I'm going to write the story. Just hold the last couple of paragraphs till ten o'clock tonight. 
Fletch leaves the office. 
FLETCH (to Fat Sam and Gummy) Make yourselves comfortable, guys, but don't leave the office. 
243 CORRIDOR 
Fletch heads for his office. Walker follows. 
WALKER Fletch! 
Fletch doesn't answer. 
244 FLETCH'S OFFICE 
256 INSERT LETTER 
We see that it is addressed to: 
JOHN BOYD CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD BOYD AVIATION 
257 STANWYK 
MR. STANYK (reading) 'Dear Sir: Alan Stanwyk murdered me tonight. The charred remains found by the police in the Jaguar are mine, not his. Mr. Stanwyk, using my name and passport, boarded Pan Am Flight 306 for Rio, where he intends to establish residence with ---' 
He stares at Fletch. 
258 FLETCH 
He is lifting Stanwyk's two attaché cases. 
FLETCH Pretty hefty. Keep reading. 
259 STANWYK 
MR. STANWYK (reading) '...with his legal wife, the former Sally Ann Cavanaugh.' 
Stanwyk stops. He's stunned, and not about to read anymore of this. 
GAIL'S VOICE (O.S.) Keep reading, Alan. 
Stanwyk spins to the doorway. 
259-A GAIL STANWYK 
standing in the doorway. 
MRS. STANWYK Don't worry, I can take it. 
260 MASTER 
FLETCH You shouldn't be here. 
MRS. STANWYK I want to hear this. 
Fletch takes the letter from Alan. 
FLETCH He doesn't read my stuff well. (reads) 'Sally Ann and Alan were married four years ago and never divorced, making Stanwyk a bigamist even in Utah. Stanwyk is also traveling with three million dollars in cash, the result of Gail Stanwyk's conversion of Boyd Aviation stock. Mrs. Stanwyk believed the money was to be used to purchase property in Utah, but it wasn't; a fact that can be confirmed by realtor James Swarthout of Provo.' (aside) That was stupid, Alan. 
MR. STANWYK I'd have been long gone. 
FLETCH Ahem. (continues reading) 'Sally Ann can confirm all this when the police pick her up at the Airport Marriott.' 
Mr. Stanwyk blanches. Fletch continues. 
FLETCH 'By the way, Alan is a very big drug smuggler, but you can read all about that in tomorrow's paper. Sincerely yours, I.M. Fletcher. P.S. Have a nice day.' 
Alan mulls over all this for a few seconds, then smiles wistfully. 
MR. STANWYK Bravo, Mr. Fletcher. 
FLETCH The thing that really tipped it off for me was something your wife said to me while we were in bed together. 
Stanwyk shoots a surprised look at Gail. She returns it with an innocent shrug. 
MR. STANWYK (to Fletch) And what was that? 
FLETCH How similar in build you and I are. then I figured it. You bump me off, throw me in the car, and burn me up. 
MRS. STANWYK My God, Alan, you really are and a**hole, aren't you? 
Now it is Alan's turn to shrug innocently. 
MR. STANWYK Sorry, darling. 
MRS. STANWYK You sonofabitch. 
MR. STANWYK Yes, I suppose I am. But I'm not a stupid sonofabitch. 
Mr. Stanwyk reaches into his desk and pulls out his gun, and levels it at Fletch. 
MR. STANWYK I was already prepared to commit one murder. What makes you think I won't commit two? 
FLETCH Whoops.

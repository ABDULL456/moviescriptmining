ZELMAN How much more is there? 
ASSISTANT Another five reels. 
ZELMAN Lights up. 
Light floods the room as the washed out image on screen is extinguished. 
DENHAM notices a sleazy looking INVESTOR wake up with a start. 
THUGGISH INVESTOR This is it? This is what we get for our forty grand, Denham? Another one of your Safari pictures? 
LEAZY INVESTOR You promised us romantic scenes with Bruce Baxter and Maureen McKenzie. 
DENHAM Come on, fellas - you know the deal - we agreed to push Maureen's start date so she could get her teeth fixed. 
THUGGISH INVESTOR It's not the principle of the thing - it's the money. 
ELMAN Carl - you've been in production for over two months - 
DENHAM Trust me, Bruce and Maureen are gonna steam up the screen - once we get them on the ship. Z ELMAN What ship? 
DENHAM The one we've hired to get to the location. 
DENHAM hurriedly pulls himself up - as ZELMAN turns on him. 
ZELMAN What location? Carl - you're supposed to be shooting on the back-lot. 
DENHAM Yes, I understand that - but fellas, we're not making that film anymore - and I'll tell you why. 
DENHAM gets out of his SEAT and moves to the FRONT of the ROOM. 
DENHAM (cont'd) The story has changed, the script has been rewritten. 
DENHAM turns to face the room, whipping a TATTERED MAP out of his pocket. 
DENHAM (cont'd) Life intervened! I've come into possession of a map. growing excitement) The soul surviving record of an unchartered island, a place that was thought to exist only in myth ... until now! 
ZELMAN Whoa! Carl - slow down! 
SLEAZY INVESTOR Is he askin' for more money? 
THUGISH INVESTOR He's asking us to fund a wild goose- chase. 
DENHAM I'm talking about a primitive world ... never before seen by man! The ruins of an entire civilisation - the most spectacular thing you've ever seen! (dramatiC pause) That's where I'll shoot my picture! 
SILENCE for a beat ... And then - 
SLEAZY INVESTOR Will there be boobies? 
DENHAM is momentarily SPEECHLESS. 
DENHAM Excuse me, boobies? 
SLEAZY INVESTOR Jigglies, jablongers, bazoomers! ... In my experience people only go to these films to observe the ... undraped form of the native girls. 
DENHAM What are you - an idiot? You think they asked De Mille to waste his time on nudie shots? No - they respected the film maker, they showed some class! Not that you'd know what that means - you cheap low-life! 
ZELMAN shifts uncomfortably in his seat as THUGGISH shoots him an ANGRY LOOK. 
ZELMAN Would you step outside for a moment, Carl? 
DENHAM looks at them ... the INVESTORS avoid EYE CONTACT. 
INT. SCREENING ROOM LOBBY - DAY 
AS DENHAM STEPS INTO THE LOBBY, PRESTON, HIS LONG SUFFERING ASSISTANT WAITS ON A SOFA. 
DENHAM points suddenly to the GLASS OF WATER on the TABLE next to PRESTON. 
DENHAM Gimme that - quick! 
PRESTON hands him the WATER. 
PRESTON You won't like it, it's non-alcoholic! 
DENHAM empties the GLASS into a POT PLANT.

INT. SCREENING ROOM LOBBY - DAY 
CLOSE ON: DENHAM listening ... 
THUGGISH INVESTOR (O.S.) (through the door) ... an ambitious no-talent! The guy has "loser" written all over him. 
ELMAN (O.S.) Look, I understand your disappointment.

ZELMAN The animal footage has value?

PRESTON We gotta delay the shoot - shut production down ... We can't sail tonight! 
DENHAM Not an option. 
RESTON Carl! 
DENHAM I said I'd find a girl. 
DENHAM turns and looks at PRESTON briefly. 
DENHAM (cont'd) For Godsake, Preston - think like a winner. Call Jack ... I need that Goddamn screenplay! 
ANGLE ON: DENHAM leans in the window, PRESTON looks on PERPLEXED.

CLOSE ON: A series of PHOTOS of SEMI NAKED WOMEN, with feather boas and peacock fans ... gaudy banners proclaiming Miss Lily Rose ... Delaware Du Boise ... Velvet Cushions ... W IDER: DENHAM is standing outside a tacky BURLESQUE THEATRE. He straightens his tie and heads towards the DOOR. 
ANGLE ON: A couple of LARGE GIRLS, followed by a SMALLER GIRL, arrive for work and enter the BURLESQUE THEATRE ... DENHAM eyes the BIGGER GIRLS, then chooses to follow the SMALLER ONE. 
ANGLE ON: DENHAM is reaching for the DOOR HANDLE to go inside, when he suddenly pauses, his eye caught by the REFLECTION in the GLASS DOOR ... 
LOSE ON: ANN ... standing in the MIDDLE of the SIDEWALK. She is unaware of DENHAM watching her. ANN stares grimly at the BURLESQUE HOARDINGS, the FLYER clutched in her hands, a small knot of anger forming in her stomach. 
LOSE ON: DENHAM's HAND lets go of the DOOR. His eyes lock on ANN through the sea of PEDESTRIANS.

EXT. FRUIT STALL - EVENING 
A BUSY FRUIT STALL on the SIDEWALK. The VENDOR is hurriedly handing out APPLES and pocketing NICKELS.

ANN'S arm is suddenly GRABBED! The ANGRY VENDOR pulls her     hand out of her pocket, which is still clutching the stolen apple. 
VENDOR (angry) You gonna pay for this? 
ANN tries to pull away. The VENDOR's grip on her arm tightens. 
DENHAM (O.S.) Excuse me ... 
ANGLE ON: DENHAM steps up behind them up HOLDING a NICKEL ... 
DENHAM (cont'd) Ma'am, I think you dropped this.

INT. NY DINER - EVENING 
ANGLE ON: ANN is eating from a FULL PLATE, trying to disguise her HUNGER. DENHAM walks over carrying a CUP of COFFEE. 
DENHAM Vaudeville huh? I worked Vaudeville once... that is a tough audience. If you don't kill them fast, they kill you. 
ANN Mr. Denham - I want you to know that I'm not in the habit of accepting charity from strangers, or for that matter ... taking things that don't belong to me. D DENHAM t was obviously a terrible misunderstanding. 
ANN It's just that, I haven't been paid in a while ... 
DENHAM mock sincerity) That's awful. Anyway, Ann - may I call you Ann? 
DENHAM leans forward ... lowering his voice. 
DENHAM (cont'd) ... You wouldn't happen to be a size four by any chance? 
ANN pauses mid way through a mouthful of food, her appetite suddenly draining away. She abruptly stands. 
DENHAM (cont'd) No! Oh God, no! You've got me all wrong. Miss Darrow, please! I'm not that type of person at all! 
ANN What type of person are you? 
DENHAM I'm someone you can trust, Ann. I'm a movie producer. (sincere) Believe me, I am on the level, no funny business. Please, sit down - Please ... Please. 
ANN hesitates a moment before sitting down once again. 
DENHAM (cont'd) (pitching the film) Ann, I want you to imagine a handsome explorer bound for the Far East. 
ANN You're filming in the Far East? 
ANGLE ON: DENHAM looking her in the eye and lying. 
DENHAM Singapore. On board ship he meets a mysterious girl. She's beautiful ... she's fragile ... haunted ... 
ANN looks up ... caught by the tale DENHAM is weaving. 
DENHAM (cont'd) She can't escape the feeling that forces beyond her control are compelling her down a road from which she cannot draw back. It's as if her whole life has been a prelude to this moment - this fateful meeting that changes everything. And sure enough, against her better judgement - 
ANN She falls in love. 
DENHAM Yes! 
ANN But she doesn't trust it. She's not even sure if she believes in love. 
DENHAM Oh really? 
ANN If she loves someone - it's doomed. 
DENHAM Why is that? 
ANN Good things never last, Mr. Denham. 
An awkward pause ... ANN looks away, having revealed too much. DENHAM considers her a beat, realising something ... 
PRESTON (hurriedly) Why don't I show Miss Darrow to her cabin? 
DENHAM Wonderful idea, thank you, Preston. 
PRESTON Miss Darrow, if you'd just - Hi, my name is Preston, Carl's assistant. 
DENHAM pulls his CHEQUE BOOK from his JACKET POCKET.

PRESTON Please, follow me. If there's anything that you need ... `excuse me fellas, if there's anything that you need please don't hesitate to ... ask ...

DENHAM Jesus, Jack - you scared me! 
DENHAM crosses to a cabinet and breaks into a CRATE OF JOHNNY WALKER.

DENHAM I'm supposed to be making a feature length picture. 
JACK You told me I had more time. I'm sorry. Look I gotta go. 
DENHAM Jack - No - you can't do this to me! I have a beginning but I need a middle and an end! I gotta have something to shoot. 
The SHIP'S ENGINES roar into life ... JACK stands to leave. 
JACK You got my notes - I gotta go. See you. 
CLOSE ON: DENHAM looking DISMAYED. He stares blankly at the RUSH of ACTIVITY through the PORTHOLE WINDOW behind JACK. 
OV: The VENTURE'S CREW hurriedly RELEASE ROPES in preparation for the ship's imminent departure. 
DENHAM'S expression slowly CHANGES ... 
DENHAM Alright, fine. We might as well settle up. 
JACK looks ASTONISHED as DENHAM pulls out his CHEQUE BOOK. 
JACK You're going to pay me? 
DENHAM I'm not going to stiff a friend. 
ACK I've never known you to volunteer cash before ...

NGLE ON: A SAILOR CRANKS a series of VALVES as the SHIP'S PISTONS crank in to life. 
DENHAM signs the CHEQUE, and hands it over with a FLOURISH ... D DENHAM (cont'd) (signing with a flourish) Voila! 
JACK snatches the CHEQUE and turns to leave. 
JACK Thanks... 
JACK glances at it. 
JACK (cont'd) Carl ... you've written "Two Grand". 
DENHAM takes the CHEQUE back ... 
DENHAM So I did ... Sorry about that (screwing it up) Let's start from the beginning. 
DENHAM (cont'd) (writing) "Two Thousand Dollars" ... 
ANGLE ON: The ship's PISTONS PUMP faster. 
DENHAM looks up at JACK, a confused look on his face. 
DENHAM (cont'd) It is the 29th, isn't it? 
JACK (anxious) Come on - it's the 25th, Carl, the 25th! 
ANGLE ON: JACK suddenly realises the SHIP is about to leave. 
RESTON dances over to the WARDROBE. 
PRESTON (cont'd) The closet ... your costumes - I hope you'll find everything is in order. If there is anything that you need, please do not hesitate to ask...fresh water, perhaps? I can bring it to you personally. 
PRESTON is interrupted by a knock on the CABIN DOOR... 
ANGLE ON: The DOOR opens and DENHAM enters. He thrusts a bottle of JOHNNY WALKER SCOTCH into ANN'S HANDS ... 
DENHAM Knock knock! We can't have our leading lady deprived of the necessities of life. to PRESTON) Do me a favour - run a bottle down to Jack. It'll fend off his migraine. 
PRESTON They're still trying to find a place for him to sleep. 
DENHAM (to PRESTON) You told him my typewriter is available for hire? 
RESTON Yes - he didn't take it well. 
PRESTON departs down the corridor. 
ANN (confused) Mr. Driscoll ...? 
DENHAM turns and looks at ANN. 
ANN (cont'd) He's on board?

INT. SHIPS HOLD - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: CHOY is showing JACK to his sleeping QUARTERS, carrying BLANKETS. 
JACK stares in DISBELIEF at the DINGY HOLD strewn with STRAW BALES and EMPTY ANIMAL CAGES. He reacts to the SMELL.

JACK (dryly) Spoilt for choice. 
ENGLEHORN surveys a COUPLE OF LARGE CAGES. 
ENGLEHORN What are you, Mr. Driscoll, a lion or a chimpanzee? 
JACK opens a CAGE large enough to sleep in. 
JACK Maybe, I'll take this one. 
He steps back with SURPRISE as a WOODEN CRATE TOPPLES, spilling out a LARGE MEDICAL BOTTLE. CHOY looks up in SHOCK as the BOTTLE ROLLS towards ENGLEHORN who coolly TRAPS it with his FOOT. E ENGLEHORN I told you to lock it up. 
CHOY (scared) Sorry, Skipper! Lumpy said - 
ENGLEHORN (interrupts) Lumpy doesn't give the orders. What are you trying to do? Put the whole ship to sleep? Get them out of here! 
ENGLEHORN hands the BOTTLE to a nervous CHOY. JACK stares at the CRATES stacked in the CAGE.

DENHAM ait a second, we're killing off the First Mate? 
JACK That's assuming she knows who the First Mate is. 
DENHAM Come on, Jack! It was an honest mistake. Ann is near-sighted - it could happen to anyone. 
JACK I was joking, Carl. 
DENHAM The point is: she's horrified. She has to look away. And that's when she sees it. 
JACK See's what? What? 
ANGLE ON: Unseen by either DENHAM or JACK, JIMMY has snuck down in to the HOLD ... 
DENHAM (dramatic) The island.

DENHAM Gentlemen please, we're not looking for trouble - 
ANGLE ON: JIMMY enters the MESS from behind him... 
JIMMY No. You're looking for something else

DENHAM (quietly) Yes .... we are. We're gonna find Skull Island! We're gonna find it, film it and show it to the world. For twenty five cents you get to see the last blank space on the map! 
LUMPY I wouldn't be so sure of that. 
PRESTON What do you mean? 
LUMPY Seven years ago, me and Mr Hayes - we were working our passage on a Norwegian barque. 
HAYES We picked up a castaway - found him in the water - he'd been drifting for days. 
LUMPY His ship had run aground on an island, way West of Sumatra. An island hidden in fog. He spoke of a huge wall, built so long ago - no one knew who had made it ... A wall a hundred foot high ... as strong today as it was, ages ago. 
PRESTON Why did they build the wall? 
SILENCE ... 
LUMPY The castaway - he spoke of a creature, neither beast nor man, but something monstrous, living behind that wall... 
DENHAM A lion or a tiger. A man-eater. That's how all these stories start. 
PRESTON (to LUMPY) What else did he say? 
LUMPY Nothing. We found him the next morning ... he'd stuck a knife through his heart.

HAYES is manning the WHEEL. ENGLEHORN is staring at the CHARTS, a CIGARETTE in his hand. There is a PALPABLE sense of tension in the AIR. 
HAYES (tense) How long do you expect us to stay out here? 
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN puts his cigarette out, ignoring HAYES. 
INT. ANN'S CABIN - NIGHT 
ANN is pacing the cabin. She is wearing a SHAWL over pyjamas. She smiles as she turns pages of a loose leaf manuscript. ANN looks up at JACK. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. VENTURE DECK - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: The MAP as it SLOWLY rotates in JACK'S HANDS. 
CLOSE ON: DENHAM leaning on the RAILING staring absently out to SEA. Behind him JACK is looking at the MAP in his HANDS. 
JACK What is that? 
DENHAM (distracted) What? 
CLOSE ON: JACK'S EYE is caught by something on the PAPER. He shifts the MAP around, turning it upside down. 
JACK That. 
JACK walks over to the railing and hands the MAP to DENHAM. 
DENHAM I don't know ... what is it, a coffee stain? 
DENHAM looks hard at the map, suddenly a look of intrigue dawning on his face. 
SLOW PUSH IN on a STRANGE SMUDGE-LIKE MARKING ... 
LOSE ON: DENHAM is CAPTIVATED ... 
CLOSE ON: DENHAM slowly looks up from the MAP, a look of HOPE kindles in his EYES. 
CLOSE ON: the STRANGE SMUDGE-LIKE MARKING. An IMAGE begins to become clear - a GORILLA-LIKE FACE. 
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: the sudden blast of the SHIP'S FOG HORN. 
DENHAM's eyes shift upwards ... 
AT THAT MOMENT a GUST of WIND plucks the MAP from DENHAM'S HAND and blows it overboard ... whirling it out to SEA ... 
EXT. OCEAN - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: The MAP FLOATING on the INKY WATER as the VENTURE steams away ... .. into a HUGE BANK of FOG that seems to melt out of the DARKNESS! 
Another BLAST from the FOG HORN echoes across the silent ocean.

The HELMSMAN hurries away. 
EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT

ANGLE ON: A CREWMAN throws a LEAD-LINE over the side. CONCERNED CREWMEN hurry to their stations. 
CREWMAN (calling) Thirty fathoms ... no bottom! 
INT. WHEELHOUSE - FOGGY NIGHT 
HAYES is tense. ENGLEHORN remains focussed, his eyes fixed ahead. 
ENGLEHORN Reduce speed, steerage way only. 
HAYES swings the TELEGRAPH LEVERS. 
HAYES Dead slow ahead, both. (beat) You should stop the ship. 
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN spins the WHEEL. 
ENGLEHORN 15 degrees Port. (beat) We're getting out of here, Mr. Hayes ... we'll find clear conditions.

ENGLEHORN looks with despair at the THICKENING FOG ahead. He starts spinning the WHEEL. 
ENGLEHORN 20 degrees starboard! 
HAYES (urgent) Captain, you don't know where the hell you're going! 
ENGLEHORN glares at HAYES. 
he VENTURE lolls WITHOUT POWER in the heavy swell. 
The HEAVY THROB of the ENGINES regain strength ... the reverse propellers pull the ship away, but still without adequate control. 
EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: ANN hurries up the STAIRS ... she clutches the RAILING for support and reels off balance, literally FALLING into JACK'S ARMS as the side of the VENTURE CRUNCHES against rock. 
EXT. VENTURE - FOGGY NIGHT 
The IMPACT sends the VENTURE into a SLOW SPIN. As the SHIP sinks in the trough of a WAVE, MORE ROCKS emerge from the WATER around it.

JACK looks down at ANN - he still has hold of her. 
INT. WHEELHOUSE - FOGGY NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN staggers into the WHEELHOUSE, slamming the TELEGRAPH LEVER forward.

EXT. OCEAN - FOGGY NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: The VENTURE rides the SWELL towards CAMERA. 
SUDDENLY! 
A SICKENING GROAN OF METAL ... as the VENTURE RUNS AGROUND on HIDDEN ROCKS! HAYES looks in HORROR as he comes within inches of the rock outcrop. 
EXT. VENTURE DECK - FOGGY NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: DENHAM watches as a HUGE STONE FACE - part of the ROCK OUTCROP they have grounded on - slides to a halt just off the VENTURE'S BOW. Weathered ... eroded away ... carved by the hand of some ANCIENT PEOPLE. 
NGLE ON: A breathless JIMMY scuttles backwards as the CROWSNEST settles against the ROCK. 
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN shuts the engines down as his ship GRINDS sickeningly against the rock ... 
... STUCK FAST. 
PANDEMONIUM ON DECK! 
NGLE ON: HAYES, unable to believe his eyes as he STARES up at the LOOMING ROCK. 
DENHAM stares at the EERIE SILHOUETTE of an ISLAND, visible through the thinning FOG. JAGGED PEAKS rise from a ROCKY SHORELINE. CRUMBLING RUINS cling to BARREN CLIFFS. 
ANN steps closer, a LOOK of total DISBELIEF on her FACE. 
INT. VENTURE ENGINE ROOM - FOGGY DAWN 
CLOSE ON: JETS of WATER are squirting into the ENGINE ROOM, through cracks between RIVETED PLATES. 
HAYES supervises STOKERS frantically opening valves on the PUMPS. OLD MATTRESSES are being shoved up against the LEAKS. 
ENGLEHORN arrives, looking GRIM. 
ENGLEHORN Hayes! 
HAYES he's taken a pounding ... 
ENGLEHORN What about the prop? 
HAYES Shaft's not bent, far as we can tell, but she's stuck hard against the rock - 
A LOUD GROAN as the SHIP shifts against the ROCKS. 
At that moment JIMMY comes bursting into the ENGINE ROOM. 
JIMMY Captain! You'd better come up quick!

HAYES You want me to bring them back? 
ENGLEHORN I don't give a damn about Carl Denham ... I want this ship fixed and ready to float on the next high tide. We're leaving Mr. Hayes. 
EXT. SKULL ISLAND COAST - DAY 
IDE ON: The WHALER rows towards the ISLAND passing great STONE RUINS jutting out of the WATER. The HUGE WALL rises out of the WAVES and disappears INLAND. 
NGLE ON: DENHAM is balanced at the front of the BOAT, filming as the SAILORS row ashore ... 
DENHAM (quietly) Can you believe this, Jack? ... Skull Island! We got our picture! 
ANGLE ON: JACK as he STARES up at the RUINS ... 
CLOSE ON: ANN, as if COMPELLED, turns and looks over the side of the BOAT, into the SEA ... her breathe catches! 
ANN'S POV: Beneath the WATER the HIDEOUSLY, DISTORTED FACE of     a FALLEN STATUE gapes up at her ... 
ANGLE ON: ANN sitting huddled to one side of the BOAT ... drawing her RAIN-SLICKER closer around her ... ANN'S FINGERS edge across the seat and curl over JACK'S HAND ... 
WIND WHISTLES through the GAPING HOLES in the EDIFICE ... a CREEPY MOANING SOUND that mixes with the DEEP BOOM of the CRASHING WAVES 
EXT. SKULL ISLAND SHORE - DAY 
A RUMBLING, BESTIAL ROAR fills the VILLAGE as if in answer to ANN'S CRY ... LOUD and CLOSE ... for a brief moment everyone freezes ... F AST ACTION: NATIVE MEN emerge as if from NOWHERE ... before anyone can react, they are roughly SHOVED and PULLED into the MIDST of the FURIOUS NATIVE MOB. 
In the SHADOWS the agitated WOMEN of the VILLAGE start rocking and wailing in unison. 
IMAGES: STRANGE FACES, smeared with MUD ... SCREECHING MOUTHS. BRUCE is HELD BACK by SEVERAL NATIVES as he struggles. JACK pulls ANN close to him, trying to protect her. ANN is wrenched from him ... 
She struggles against her captors ... 
ANGLE ON: A OLD-WOMAN moves through the midst of the VILLAGERS ... her gaze fixed on ANN, muttering curses, eyes burning with a dark fury ... 
DENHAM is YELLING at the NATIVES ... he is SHOVED to the GROUND. 
The NATIVES SHRIEK. One of the SAILORS is DRAGGED forward, his HEAD pushed against a FLAT STONE SLAB, and CLUBBED TO DEATH. 
ANGLE ON: In the midst of the CONFUSION, JACK sees the          OLD SHA-WOMAN screaming at ANN. She starts chanting with rising HYSTERICS ... 
SHA-WOMAN (chanting) Larri yu sano korê ... Kweh yonê kah`weh ad-larr ... torê Kông. 
CLOSE ON: JACK struggles, fists flying - he is clubbed and DROPS like a stone. 
ANN SCREAMS ... the BEAST ROARS in the DISTANCE! 
DENHAM punches a NATIVE ... they haul him forward and thrust his HEAD onto the BLOOD SPLATTERED STONE ... NATIVE CLUBS rise into the air ... 
.. a GUNSHOT! 
The NATIVES hesitate, as if STUNNED ... then SCATTER. 
ENGLEHORN, HAYES and an ARMED GROUP of SAILORS race into the VILLAGE! 
ENGLEHORN roughly hauls DENHAM to his feet.

INT.   DENHAM'S CABIN - NIGHT 
DENHAM is swigging from a HIP FLASK. HERB and PRESTON are gathered gloomily around a TABLE, while DENHAM strides around the ROOM, swigging and talking in a animated fashion. The STORM BATTERS and CRASHES outside. 
DENHAM We got away. We gotta be grateful for that gentlemen. 
PRESTON What about Mike? He didn't get away - he's still there! 
DENHAM (sharply) Mike died doing what he believed in! He didn't die for nothing. And I'll tell you something else - I'm going to finish this film - for Mike. 
I'm going to NHAM(cont'd) donate the DE finish it and proceeds to his wife and kids - because that man is a hero and he deserves nothing less! 
HERB Hear! Hear! 
INT. ANN'S CABIN - NIGHT 
ANN alone in her CABIN, is overwhelmed by a terrible SENSE of FOREBODING ...

INT. MESS ROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: JACK sprawled on a BENCH SEAT in the MESS ... a LOUD METALLIC CREAK wakes him up. He rolls over, tries to focus ... he touches his hand to the back of his HEAD ... when he withdraws his hand ... his fingers are covered in BLOOD.

EXT. VENTURE DECK - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: JACK staggers on to the BACK DECK, clutching a railing to steady himself. He suddenly discovers a NATIVE NECKLACE on the DECK ... 
... JACK stares at the NECKLACE, decorated with a MONKEY SKULL, a look of HORRIFIED REALIZATION growing. JIMMY is racing past, JACK grabs him: 
JACK Where's Ann? 
JIMMY She went to her cabin. 
ANGLE ON: JACK loading a BOX of AMMUNITION on to the other BOAT ... he looks tensely at the FIRES burning on the ISLAND.

ANGLE ON: JACK in the OTHER BOAT, looking GRIM and DETERMINED. 
EXT. SKULL ISLAND COAST - NIGHT 
ANGLE ON: the TINY BOATS are tossed in the RAGING SEAS. SAILORS try to STEER them towards the SHORE, as they bounce off ROCKS and STATUES. 
EXT. TOP OF WALL - NIGHT 
LOSE ON: FLAMING TORCHES ignite POOLS of OIL along the length of the TOP of the WALL. 
ANGLES ON: ANN'S WRIST'S are TIED outstretched to BAMBOO POSTS. She is on the SUMMIT of the WALL, lit by the flickering FLAMES ... looking out onto DARK TREE TOPS. F LAMES DANCE ... DRUMS BEAT in a RITUALISTIC FRENZY. 
ANGLE ON: SKULL ISLANDERS knock away WOODEN PLUGS, releasing the FLAMING OIL to pour down rough CHANNELS hewn into the STONE of the WALL ... it runs and falls down CHUTES into POOLS carved into the GROTTO WALLS. 
WIDE ON: The CLIFF WALLS light up as FLAMES within LARGE CARVED CHAMBERS create huge backlit PAGAN FACES. 
FIRELIGHT dances across the nightmarish JUNGLE ... DISTANT TREES start to TREMBLE, their canopies swaying as if PUSHED by an UNSEEN FORCE. 
CLOSE ON: ANN ... looking on with HORROR at the MOVEMENT in the JUNGLE below her. She struggles against the ROPES, to no avail. 
CLOSE ON: The OLD WOMAN, eyes rolled up in her head. 
LOSE ON: A NECKLACE is placed over ANN'S head. 
ANGLE ON: A SHAMAN starts BEATING out a RHYTHM on a LOG DRUM ... SKULL ISLANDERS fall to their KNEES ... a MOANING WAIL rises ... the DRUMMING builds to a FRENZIED CLIMAX. 
WIDE ON: On the OTHER SIDE, the WALL falls away vertically into a ROCKY GROTTO, leading into the DENSE TANGLED JUNGLE of SKULL ISLAND. 
SUDDENLY ANN feels herself DRAGGED FORWARD ... the POSTS she is tied to are MOVING, pulling her TOWARDS the EDGE of the WALL! ANN digs her heels and tries to PULL AGAINST it, but is unable to stop herself being HAULED OFF THE WALL ... .. into thin air! 
ANGLE ON: SKULL ISLANDERS lowering the BAMBOO ALTAR STRUCTURE DOWN, slowly releasing the flaxen ROPE. 
ANN is dangling from the POSTS by her WRISTS, as the HINGED FRAMEWORK swings her out over the CHASM, LOWERING her towards a ROCK PROMONTORY on the EDGE of the FOREST. 
NGLE ON: ANN is LOWERED onto the ROCK PROMONTORY, which resembles an ALTAR ... ANN struggles to free herself, but she is tied fast to the posts, a TINY FIGURE illuminated by enormous GLOWING CARVINGS ... the WALL towering up behind her. 
ANGLES ON: ANN squirms ... as the FOREST BELOW HER BROILS and SEETHES! TREES are violently SWAYING ... above the crescendo of the NATIVE FRENZY, ANGRY BESTIAL ROARS can be heard. 
SKULL ISLANDERS line the TOP of the WALL, their WAILING and CHANTING interrupted by a LOUD SPLINTERING SOUND. 
EXT. SKULL ISLAND SHORE - NIGHT 
The SHIP'S BOATS pull up at the foot of the great STAIRCASE. JACK leaps out of the BOAT and races up the stairs. 
EXT. WALL GROTTO - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON: ANN lifts her head ... something VERY BIG is moving towards HER. 
ANN catches a BRIEF GLIMPSE of a HUGE DARK SHAPE propelling itself THROUGH the JUNGLE ... the OILY SMOKE from the FIRES hangs in the air, OBSCURING HER VISION ... she can now only hear the CREATURE'S MOVEMENTS and BREATH as it draws ever closer. 
ANN cowers back, pulling at her bonds. 
A MASSIVE SHAPE moves through the air ... The ground SHAKES with a sudden force of IMPACT! 
ANGLE ON: ANN stands trembling, as the swirling smokey cloud slowly DISSIPATES ... a GIANT LEATHERY FOOT is visible. 
CLOSE ON: ANN balanced on a knife-edge of TERROR. 
A SUDDEN PUFF OF WIND INSTANTLY CLEARS THE VEILING SMOKE. 
ANN slowly LOOKS UP, her face filled with DREAD. 
The SKULL ISLANDERS reply in UNISON ... a piercing WAIL, from the TOP of the WALL. 
ANN'S strength suddenly DRAINS from her legs, and SLUMPS between the POSTS. 
Before her is ... KONG! 
A 25 FOOT TALL MALE GORILLA! KONG stares at ANN for a beat, leaning forward on his KNUCKLES ... then prods her with his finger. 
SUDDENLY ... GUNSHOTS! 
EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE/WALL - NIGHT 
FRENZIED MOVEMENT: SAILORS, lead by ENGLEHORN, race into the VILLAGE firing WARNING SHOTS in the air ... SKULL ISLANDERS SCATTER in TERROR ... 
EXT. WALL GROTTO - NIGHT 
IDE ON: KONG in front of ANN ... HE RISES to his full height and BEATS HIS CHEST!

EXT. NATIVE VILLAGE/WALL - NIGHT 
FRENZIED MOVEMENT: SAILORS, lead by ENGLEHORN, race into the VILLAGE firing WARNING SHOTS in the air ... SKULL ISLANDERS SCATTER in TERROR ... 
ANGLES ON: The SKULL ISLANDERS melt away into the darkness ... vanishing as fast as they appeared. 
... from behind the WALL, the DISTANT CRY of ANN screaming for help, following by an EARTH SHUDDERING ROAR. 
ENGLEHORN (staring upwards) What in God's name was that? 
JACK (sudden realisation) Behind the wall! 
DENHAM No!!! 
DENHAM and JACK scramble to their feet and start to RUN!   DENHAM cradles the CAMERA and TRIPOD in his ARMS, as the   BRONTO PACK bears down on them from behind! 
Spectacular TRACKING SHOT: ... The PACK of 15 CARNOTAURS are CLOSING IN on the BRONTOSAURUS HERD! A CARNOTAUR leaps onto the back of a FLEEING BRONTOSAUR, causing it to falter and slide against the cliff. TWO MORE CARNOTAURS leap onto the ailing BRONTOSAUR as the rest of the pack stream past. 
DENHAM, JACK and the OTHERS are running as fast as they can ... JACK glances over his shoulder - the WALL of THUNDERING BRONTOSAUR LEGS are about to ENGULF THEM! A NGLE ON: JACK and DENHAM suddenly find themselves in a SEA of HUGE LEGS - like wildly pounding Redwood tree trunks! The CARNOTAURS are snapping and snarling at the LEGS ... they see the MEN! Their only hope of survival is to stay WITHIN THE STAMPEDE, out of reach of the MEATEATERS! 
QUICK IMAGES: THE GROUP in the SEA of LEGS ... a SAILOR trips and is CRUSHED UNDERFOOT. A COUPLE OF SAILORS jump clear of the BRONTOSAURS - only to be set on by the CARNOTAURS. JACK ... DENHAM ... SAILORS ... everyone is running madly, dodging BRONTOSAURS, CARNOTAURS and trying not to fall! 
A CARNOTAUR focuses on JACK ... it skillfully weaves IN BETWEEN and UNDER the BRONTOSAURS and emerges right behind JACK, it's SNAPPING JAWS inches away from his head! 
ACK suddenly SIDE-STEPS, and SHOULDER-BARGES the CARNOTAUR SIDEWAYS - under a BRONTOSAUR'S LEGS. The CARNOTAUR is instantly trampled! 
BRUCE is managing to stay ahead of the stampede - possibly RUNNING FASTER than any human before him! A CARNOTAUR races out in front of the stampede and bears down on BRUCE with incredible speed! BRUCE desperately waves a TOMMY GUN at the CARNOTAUR ... TOWARDS THE STAMPEDE! 
JACK sees it coming ... 
JACK (yelling) No!!!! 
BRUCE FIRES, missing the CARNOTAUR ... 
... but he hits the LEAD BRONTOSAUR, following behind, in the chest. The BRONTOSAUR COLLAPSES AT TOP SPEED! It CARTWHEELS OVER, it's huge NECK and TAIL thrashing out. The OTHER BRONTOSAURS PLOUGH INTO IT, tripping and rolling! 
JACK and the SAILORS suddenly find themselves in the middle of an amazing FLESHY FREIGHT TRAIN PILE-UP! SAILORS are crushed as BRONTOSAURS come down on top of them! A CARNOTAUR is squashed when TWO BRONTOSAURS slam together. 
JACK rolls against a rock as MOUNTAINS of BRONTOSAUR TUMBLE all around him. 
DENHAM throws himself onto the ground, shielding the CAMERA. 
n the space of seconds, the MIGHTY HERD OF BEHEMOTHS is reduced to a VAST PILE of DEAD or WOUNDED ANIMALS ... The CARNOTAURS immediately go to work, leaping onto BRONTOSAURS, ripping into fleshy stomachs. J ACK crawls past huge HEAVING BELLIES and TWITCHING LEGS ... he staggers out of the DINOSAUR PILE-UP ... he turns back at the SOUND OF LOUD HISSING - a CARNOTAURUS is climbing over a DEAD BRONTOSAUR, it's gleaming eyes intent on JACK. The CARNOTAURUS leaps ... 
BAM! BAM! BAM! The CARNOTAURUS is riddled with BULLETS and falls DEAD at JACK'S FEET! 
HAYES hurries towards JACK, clutching his TOMMY GUN! 
HAYES (yelling) Go! Go! 
HAYES sends the rest of the MEN up a steep ROCKY SLOPE ... they SLIP and SLIDE on the SLIMY MOSS-COVERED ROCKS. 
JACK doesn't move. He looks around in mounting panic. 
JACK (frantic) Carl!? Carl?! Get up! 
DENHAM limps out of the PILE-UP, bloodied and covered in DUST - the CAMERA in his arms. 
HAYES blasts at another CARNOTAURUS - it TOPPLES BACKWARDS. 
HAYES Run! 
EXT. SLIMY SLOPE - DAY 
The GROUP are desperately scrambling up the STEEP ROCKY SLOPE - slipping and sliding on the WET MOSS ... FOUR SURVIVING CARNOTAURS follow in pursuit ... the MEN start sliding backwards in their panic. The CARNOTAURS are sliding too, but their powerful legs are working furiously, propelling them closer and closer to the flailing SAILORS! 
A SAILOR loses his footing completely ... he rolls past TWO CARNOTAURS before being grabbed by the JAWS of the THIRD. 
The MEN grab hold of WEEDS, ROCKS ... ANYTHING, to get away from the DINOSAURS. They are crawling towards a network of NARROW FISSURES between HUGE ROCKS ... which the CARNOTAURS cannot squeeze through. 
ANGLE ON: HERB is scrabbling up as best as he can with his bad leg ... DENHAM moves towards him, reaching desperately ... 
DENHAM Herb! Come on! 
HERB (gasping) Mr Denham ... ! Take the tripod. 
DENHAM Come on Herb - I'm pulling you up. Come on, hold on to your end. 
HERB (gasping) You gotta go!! 
DENHAM I'm not going anywhere without you! 
HERB You gotta leave me! 
HERB is straining to hold the TRIPOD when his GAMMY LEG gives way ... he SLIPS and ROLLS into the path of an oncoming CARNOTAUR! 
CLOSE ON: DENHAM reacting in SHOCK as HERB is KILLED by the frenzying CARNOTAURS. 
EXT. JUNGLE RUINS - DAY 
ANGLE ON: KONG drops ANN onto the ground. She LANDS in a LIFELESS heap. 
KONG has dropped ANN in a small RUINED COURTYARD, it's WALLS are cracked and split by encroaching JUNGLE CREEPERS. 
IDE ON: KONG circles around ANN who lies MOTIONLESS on the GROUND. He PRODS her ROUGHLY with a FINGER ... no response.   KONG GROWLS ... PRODS AGAIN ... ANN lies STILL. 
LOSE ON: ANN ... she slowly OPENS HER EYES! ANN looks warily towards KONG. 
EXT. EDGE OF SWAMP - DAY 
ACK, DENHAM, HAYES, BRUCE, JIMMY, LUMPY, CHOY and PRESTON clamber down a JAGGED ROCK face into lush sub-tropical VEGETATION. They are followed by a few surviving SAILORS - a bedraggled GROUP ... CUT, BRUISED, COVERED in DUST, SOAKED in SWEAT. Most of the GUNS are lost. 
AILORS slump to the ground, EXHAUSTED. 
They are on a NARROW CLEARING at the edge of a MISTY SWAMP. SHEER CLIFFS rise out of the SWAMP on both sides of the SHORE. 
HAYES Jimmy, do a head count. I wanna know how many injured and how bad - 
LUMPY (interrupting) Injured? Four of us are dead! 
CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaches with a trembling hand for his HIP FLASK. He takes a big SWIG ... and stands staring out over the SWAMP. PRESTON sits on A TREE STUMP nearby. 
PRESTON It's not your fault. What happened to Herb - it's no ones fault. 
DENHAM (soft realization) You're absolutely right, Preston ... And I'll tell you something else. Herbert didn't die for nothing. He died for what he believed in and I'm gonna honour that. 
CLOSE ON: DENHAM reaching for that moment of self justification. 
DENHAM (cont'd) He died believing there is still some mystery left in this world - and we can all have a piece of it - for the price of an admission ticket! (excited) Goddammit Preston we're gonna finish this film for Herb. We'll finish it, and donate the proceeds to his wife and kids. 
CLOSE ON: PRESTON, he has heard this all before. 
ANN watches as KONG lopes off. He pulls himself up and over a RUINED WALL and DISAPPEARS from SIGHT. 
ANGLE ON: ANN, rising to her feet, finally free of her captor. 
EXT. THICK JUNGLE - DAY 
NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... pushing THROUGH thorns, TANGLED in VINES ... she is EXHAUSTED, THIRSTY. 
EXT. LOG CHASM - DAY 
IDE ANGLE: DENHAM, JACK, HAYES, LUMPY, JIMMY, PRESTON and the remaining CREW have arrived at a DARK, VINE ENTANGLED CHASM ... spanning the narrow, but deadly RAVINE is a SINGLE FALLEN TREE. 
WEAK SUNLIGHT filters through the DARK CANOPY above casting a SICKLY GREEN HUE over the place. 
IDE ON: HAYES, followed by JIMMY, leads the GROUP across the SLIMY, MOSS covered LOG ... the going is treacherous. 
ANGLE ON: DENHAM struggling with the CAMERA ... JACK follows HAYES ... LUMPY helps CHOY. They put one foot in front of the other, trying not to let the DROP unnerve them. 
ANGLE ON: HAYES suddenly stops ... tensely scanning the DARK RUINS on the other side of the CHASM ... 
CREEPY POV: ... something is watching the MEN on the LOG. J IMMY (low voice) What is it? 
HAYES motions for JIMMY to be quiet. He stares intently into    the DARKNESS of the FOREBODING RUINS. 
JIMMY (cont'd) (whispering) Mr. Hayes ...? 
HAYES turns and looks at JIMMY. 
HAYES If anything happens, I want you to run! Understand? 
JIMMY I'm not a coward - I ain't gonna run. 
HAYES (gently) It's not about being brave, Jimmy. 
CLOSE ON: JIMMY looking at HAYES uneasily, as he continues across the LOG. 
EXT. FAR EDGE OF CHASM - DAY 
NGLE ON: HAYES is the first to step off the LOG, to the safety of the FAR BANK.

CLOSE ON: HAYES ... peers into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL. 
ANGLE ON: A PAIR of GLEAMING EYES, reflecting LIGHT ... rushing towards HAYES. 
HAYES o back! Back across the log! 
The GROUP on the LOG FREEZE, start to BACK AWAY, slipping and sliding on the WET MOSS. 
JIMMY I ain't gonna run. 
HAYES Get Jimmy out of here. 
ANGLE ON: HAYES... SHOOTS into the DARKNESS of the TUNNEL. 
KONG rampages out of the TUNNEL MOUTH! He SNATCHES HAYES with one SWEEP of his HAND. 
CLOSE ON: HAYES in KONG's HAND ... 
IMMY yells! KONG's GAZE turns toward the MEN on the LOG! 
JIMMY No! Let him go! (to HAYES) Kill him! Kill him! 
HAYES (to KONG) Look at me! Look at me! 
JIMMY (desperate) Bring him down! Mr Hayes! 
SLOWLY HAYES begins to lift his PISTOL up ... KONG's GAZE locks back on HAYES ... 
HAYES deadly calm) You've gotta run, Jimmy. 
IMMY No! I ain't gonna run. 
HAYES Do as I say. (to JIMMY) G o with Jack ... All of you. 
KONG stares at HAYES a BEAT ... HAYES suddenly raises his PISTOL at KONG to shoot! 
HAYES (cont'd) Run! 
ANGLE ON: KONG HURLS HAYES at the SAILORS ... he flies over their heads like RAG-DOLL and smashes against the FAR WALL of the RAVINE with a sickening CRUNCH. 
JIMMY No! 
JIMMY runs at KONG, blinded by tears of GRIEF and RAGE ... JACK KNOCKS him down and SHOOTS at KONG. 
JACK (desperate) Shoot him! 
WILD SHOOTING from the SAILORS, as they try to maintain BALANCE on the LOG. 
KONG ROARS ... DESPERATE SAILORS try to back across the RAVINE. 
KONG runs towards the LOG ... KONG'S FIST smashes at the LOG, knocking the men off balance. A SAILOR plummets off into the CHASM below. 
EXT. THICK JUNGLE - DAY 
NGLE ON: ANN hurrying through the JUNGLE ... hearing the sound of gun fire. 
ANN Hey! Here! Over here! 
She runs up the bank towards the noise. 
EXT. FAR EDGE OF CHASM - DAY 
IDE ON: KONG has LIFTED the END of the LOG! 
JACK, DENHAM, LUMPY, CHOY, JIMMY, PRESTON and THREE SAILORS hold on for dear life ... as KONG vigorously TWISTS and SHAKES the LOG, bucking the MEN into the air. 
ANGLE ON: DENHAM skates on the MOSS and his CAMERA slides away, becoming WEDGED in the fork of a STUMP. 
WIDE ON: KONG SEES AND CLIMBS UP TOWARDS IT, PULLING IT DOWN. THEY ALL TUMBLE DEEPER INTO THE CHASM, AND SUDDENLY ANN FINDS HERSELF DANGLING FROM THE JAWS OF THE TYRANNOSAUR ABOVE THE JAWS OF ANOTHER! KONG SWINGS AND KICKS THE TYRANNOSAUR IN THE HEAD ... ANN LOSES HER GRIP AND PLUMMETS DOWN ... VINES BREAKING AS SHE FALLS. AND more SMASHING AGAINST THE CHASM WALLS ... SHE FALLS AND LANDS ON THE HEAD OF ANOTHER. FALLS AGAIN. SHE LANDS IN THE SWAMP. RUNS. IT CHASES. 
EXT. CLEARING - DAY 
WIDE ON: ANN faces the TYRANNOSAUR! SUDDENLY KONG THUDS DOWN BEHIND HER ... GLARING AT THE DINOSAUR ... ANN FINDS HERSELF CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO BEASTS. ANN WEIGHS UP HER OPTIONS BETWEEN BOTH ... and for a moment ANN & KONG LOCK EYES. SHE THEN BACKS BENEATH THE LOOMING FIGURE OF KONG. T HE TYRANNOSAUR SNARLS at KONG and he ROARS BACK ... KONG THROWS ANN GENTLY to the side as HE and the TYRANNOSAUR LUNGE at each other. 
KONG GRABS HIS JAWS in BOTH HANDS forcing it OPEN and BITING the TYRANNOSAUR'S TONGUE. HE ROLLS the TYRANNOSAUR over and over, using all his strength to force the TYRANNOSAUR'S JAWS OPEN before RIPPING them clean APART at the HINGE! The TYRANNOSAUR sprawls back, DEAD. 
KONG is PANTING HEAVILY ... he has been BITTEN, RAKED and CUT.    He puts his foot on the LAST TYRANNOSAUR and BEATS HIS CHEST, TRIUMPHANTLY with a DEAFENING ROAR. 
WIDE ON: KONG KICKS THE DINOSAUR OUT THE WAY. KONG ROARS ANGRILY - his blood is up, he is ready to take on the world. HE STANDS NEXT TO ANN, BUT HE WON'T LOOK AT HER DIRECTLY. SHE TRIES TO HIS ATTENTION BUT HE LOOKS AWAY. HE LUMBERS AWAY. KONG has DEADLY INTENT in his EYES. ANN watches as he DISAPPEARS into the JUNGLE. 
ANGLE ON: ANN, CONFUSED for a minute ... THEN RUNS AFTER HIM. 
ANN Wait! 
ANGLE ON: ANN is roughly SWUNG into the air, as KONG bounds off into the DEEP JUNGLE INTERIOR.

CLOSE ON: ANN HANGS ON for dear life as KONG GALLOPS into the JUNGLE. 
KONG moves SWIFTLY and POWERFULLY through the JUNGLE with ANN on his SHOULDER ...

EXT. BOTTOM OF CHASM - DAY 
CLOSE ON: JACK STIRRING, immediately hearing the SCUTTLE OF INSECTS. HE ROLLS OVER and see's HUGE SPIDERS CRAWLING INTO THE PIT. HE staggers to his FEET ... REACHING INTO HIS PACK and PULLS from it A FLARE. THROWING it at the SPIDERS they CRAWL OFF. 
DENHAM is lying nearby. 
JACK Carl!!! 
DENHAM STIRS, MUMBLING IN PAIN BUT ALIVE. 
JACK SEES JIMMY. 
CLOSE ON: JIMMY is looking VACANTLY into space, JACK kneels down. 
JACK (cont'd) Jimmy?

ANGLE ON: DENHAM sitting up... dawning realization in his eyes. 
LUMPY, his back to CHOY ... he HOLDS CHOY'S HAND ... but CHOY'S FINGERS SLIDE LIMPLY out of LUMPY'S HAND ... LUMPY TURNS TO CHOY .. ONLY TO SEE THAT HE has DIED. 
NGLE ON: HAYES' eyes closed, his FACE peaceful, lying DEAD on the floor of the RAVINE. 
ANGLE ON: DENHAM PEERING over a ROCK. The wreckage of the CAMERA lies smashed and broken on the CHASM floor ... a thin, shiny, thread of black FILM trailing from the smashed CAMERA body like spilt innards. 
DENHAM reaches out and touches the EXPOSED FILM ... his dreams DESTROYED. 
WIDE ON: THE FLARE SLOWLY DIES. 
CLOSE ON: JACK cradling JIMMY in his ARMS. HE LOOKS UP as he SEES the INSECTS CRAWL BACK.

JACK tries to PULL THE GIANT CRAB-SPIDER OFF LUMPY, but instead it TURNS on him! More GIANT CRAB-SPIDERS JUMP at JACK. 
LUMPY and CHOY are CONSUMED by the nightmarish BUGS. 
ANGLE ON: DENHAM is WIELDING a short stick like a CLUB ... he smashes the HUGE BUGS in a psychotic explosion of RAGE, pulverizing their bodies into the DIRT! 
All around, MONSTROSITIES OF NATURE emerge from DANK BURROWS and crawl towards the JACK, DENHAM and JIMMY ... these are HUGE INSECTILE MUTANTS - combinations of SPIDERS, CRABS, MANTISES and CENTIPEDES! 
SUDDENLY JIMMY notices the TOMMY GUN sticking out of JACK'S PACK. GRABBING IT he aims at the INSECTS on JACK. 
BAM! BAM! BAM! The GIANT INSECTS are blown apart! 
JACK looks wildly around for DENHAM. THEY SEE that they're SURROUNDED BY SPIDERS. ANGLE ON: JACK desperately swings at the INSECTS with a STICK, whacking and stabbing them. 
BAM! BAM! BAM! GUNSHOTS RING OUT. SPIDERS SWARM out of HOLES in the CLIFF AND DIE. JACK spins around ... confused. 
ANGLE ON: ENGLEHORN and a COUPLE of SAILORS OPEN FIRE from the LIP of the CHASM, SHOOTING the SPIDERS into SMITHEREENS! 
ANGLE ON: BRUCE SWINGS down from above, clinging to a VINE ... GUN BLAZING! 
BRUCE proceeds to lay waste to the INSECTS ... those not    blasted apart, scurrying away, back in to the darkness. 
EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 
Moving purposefully along a well-known route to his LAIR, KONG launches himself across a LOW CHASM ... one hand reaching out to clutch at THICK VINES on the other side ... 
SUDDENLY! The THICK VINES TEAR AWAY from the side of the CHASM WALL ... KONG falls backwards. ANN still clutched protectively to his CHEST he lands with a THUD! 
ANN looks up alarmed! 
KONG scrambles to his feet, GROWLING ... he places ANN on the GROUND pushing her protectively behind him. 
KONG POV: LOOMING out of the CHASM WALL is a HUGE FACE! 
CLOSE ON: ANN as her expression suddenly changes from FEAR to DAWNING COMPREHENSION. 
ANN walks past KONG ... who emits another LOW, WARNING GROWL. 
ANN It's alright ... it's okay ... 
ANN reaches the WALL and begins to pull away more of the VINES and CREEPERS to reveal ... 
A life-size and very life-like eroded STATUE of a SITTING GIANT GORILLA ... the IMAGE of KONG ... 
ANN turns back excitedly to KONG, trying to make him understand. 
ANN (cont'd) Look - it's you ... "Kong". See ... you. "Kong". This is you.

CLOSE ON: JACK freezes. 
NGLE ON: A LARGE NUMBER of BAT-THINGS are GATHERING amid the STALACTITES that hang from the ROOF of the CAVERN. 
He scans the LAIR for any sign of ANN ... but can't see her. The OLD BONES of a LARGE GORILLA lie across the CAVE from JACK.

LOSE ON: KONG GROWLS ... JACK SPINS AROUND ... KONG is growling in his sleep! 
JACK is less than 8 FEET away from ANN. 
CLOSE ON: ANN'S eyes OPEN. For a MOMENT she stares blankly at JACK ... then REALISATION arrives quickly - he has come for her! She looks at JACK with disbelief. 
LOSE ON: JACK looks at ANN, drawing a finger to his lips ... neither DARES to move, or make a sound. 
ERY SLOWLY, JACK rises and steps towards ANN. He gestures for her to stay motionless in KONG'S PALM. 
NGLE ON: The salivating, carnivorous BAT-THINGS flutter out of the CAVE and SWARM around the LEDGE ... their FEAR of KONG is overwhelmed by the tempting SIGHT of JACK and ANN. 
KONG STIRS. 
CLOSE ON: JACK extends his HAND towards ANN ... she reaches out ... their FINGERS TOUCH ...

The FRENZIED BAT-THINGS ATTACK KONG EN MASSE as he snatches ANN from the LEDGE. 
They strike at KONG and ANN like a swarm of giant bees. KONG ROARS and THRASHES OUT at them in a FRENZY! 
NGLE ON: KONG puts ANN down against the ROCKS, so he can use BOTH HANDS to strike at the DEADLY BAT-THINGS. With every sweep of his ARM, several BAT-THINGS are KNOCKED TO THE GROUND, but OTHERS claw at his HEAD and BODY. A NGLE ON: JACK seizes his CHANCE! He rushes along the EDGE of the CLIFF towards ANN ... under the cover of an OVERHANG. 
JACK and ANN are inches away from each other right behind KONG'S FEET! 
ACK grabs ANN'S HAND and leads her towards the only possible escape route - the EDGE of the LEDGE, 1000 FEET above the JUNGLE! 
JACK grabs a LARGE VINE, testing it's strength. He turns to     Ann. 
JACK (urgent) This way! Come on! 
JACK pulls ANN to him and clambers over the EDGE of the   DIZZYING DROP.

ANN (cont'd) No! 
KONG breathes in the cloud of CHLOROFORM, he tries to push himself up. 
ENGLEHORN Keep him down! 
SAILORS throw BOULDERS down from the TOP of the WALL,   pummelling KONG'S HEAD. 
ANN breaks away from JACK, rushes at ENGLEHORN, grabbing his   arm just as he prepares to throw another CHLOROFORM BOTTLE. 
ANN Stop it! You're killing him!

FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT December 21, 2001 
FADE IN: 1    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                    1 As we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical American high school... 1A   ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                                1A ...we hear all the sounds of a STANDARD PORNO FLICK, from the unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music. 1B   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY                1B The sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light from an open door... MATT (O.S.) This is unwatchable. It's not even in focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is in the shot. This is really shoddy work. 1C   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM   - DAY                1C The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face. DEACON (O.S.) Why do they always show the guy's face? It's like, can't we just assume he's enjoying it? We slowly PULL BACK from the TV. FRED (O.S.) Because they're trying to make us feel like we're better looking than that guy, so we should be able to get chicks as hot as her. DEACON (O.S.) How the hell do you know? FRED (O.S.) It's a basic rule of porno. Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON. They're watching the porno... 2    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY                   2 ... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can still hear the porno. The three guys are sitting with their book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage.

11   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                   11 Deacon talks quietly to a DORKY FRESHMAN. DEACON Dirty Darla #7 is a modern classic. This is grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot more than twenty dollars. DORKY FRESHMAN Sweet. He hands him the money and Deacon makes the exchange for the tape. The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away. Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. He sees a gaggle of teenage GIRLS gossiping. DEACON (V.O.) People always talk about how tough it is being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have to watch one more TV movie about bulimia or self mutilation or vaginal dryness... Deacon reaches his locker and opens it. He sees some CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some books for class. DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.) (CONT'D) I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's like to have only one thing on your mind all day, every day, but to have absolutely no way of getting it. 12   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY                                        12 CLOSE ON a textbook showing the anatomy of the vagina. PULL BACK to reveal Deacon, seemingly staring into space, but really staring at... DEACON (V.O.) Testosterone is a drug more powerful than heroin. I don't really have any evidence to support that, but the point is, a horny teenage boy will do almost anything for even a glimpse of sex. ... his BIOLOGY TEACHER's erect NIPPLES visible through her conservative bra and blouse. Aside from her flashing headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even if you were alone with her on a two-man luge. But that doesn't matter-- Deacon can't take his eyes off of them.

BIOLOGY TEACHER (in the background) ... the increase in the hormone testosterone causes certain physiological changes in the adolescent male... DEACON (V.O.) We're suffering. Suffering from a deep, debilitating addiction to something we've never even had. Teenage boys are like time bombs, ready to explode. BEHIND DEACON Two GUYS are whispering. GUY 1 Did you hear about Rachael? GUY 2 No, what happened? GUY 1 John Baldwin nailed her. Deacon bolts upright and spins around, concerned. DEACON Are you talking about Rachael Unger? GUY 1 Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's party. In the bathroom. DEACON (crushed) You're kidding. 13   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)                        13 RACHAEL UNGER, Deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked under Deacon's sheets after school one day. Deacon ENTERS from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state of undress. DEACON Rachael! What are you doing? She sits up and strikes a sexy pose. RACHAEL We've been together for a year now, and I thought it was time to take our relationship to the next level. Deacon is becoming very nervous.

DEACON Now? RACHAEL You've been talking about this for months. DEACON I didn't think you were listening to me. Suddenly, Rachael becomes a little self-conscious. RACHAEL Don't you want to? DEACON Of course I do. But, I, um... I don't have anything... She pulls out a condom. RACHAEL I do. But he's still hesitating. RACHAEL (CONT'D) Deacon, what's the problem? Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the taking. An eternity passes. Then, DEACON I have a math test tomorrow. 14   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY (END FLASHBACK)                        14 The Teacher CLEARS HER THROAT and Deacon snaps out of it. He turns away from the guys behind him as they continue to describe the John Baldwin incident. DEACON (V.O.) "I have a math test tomorrow." The bottom line is, I just couldn't do it. I don't know why, I just couldn't. And I've cursed myself every day since then. Deacon is suddenly... 15   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                   15 ... very depressed as he trudges to his locker. Which is nothing compared to how he feels when he looks

RUSS Gotcha! Fred SCREAMS. RUSS (CONT'D) I've been watching you. Russ grabs Fred by the shoulders and throws him up against the shelf, shaking him with every word. RUSS (CONT'D) Those movies aren't for little monkey- boys! FRED Aaaaaahhhhhhhh! The Customers stop to stare at the scene. Fred breaks free, and Russ chases after him. RUSS Come back here, you bastard! Russ runs after him and DIVES at Fred's legs, knocking him and entire shelf of tapes over. The tape FLY EVERYWHERE. Fred is still SCREAMING. Russ starts shouting at Fred so that everyone can hear. A crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle. RUSS (CONT'D) What else you got in here? Russ rips open Fred's bag and pulls out items, looking for more tapes. Fred tries to stop him, but the old man has an iron grip and keeps him away. Fred cringes as Russ exposes porno magazines, kleenex tissues, baby wipes, the bottle of Moisty-Mate Firming Lotion, Q-tips, women's sexy underwear, surgical gloves... Wendy and Kelly are completely grossed out. RUSS (CONT'D) (totally confused) What's this for? ...and a Barbie-type DOLL with a pullstring. Russ pulls it. DOLL I'm Candy. Let's play dress-up. The crowd is now seriously disturbed. MARK Dude.

Fred sits there, whimpering on the ground. 19   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY                                         19 Deacon drives the DMV Tester Car under the watchful eye of the DMV TESTER. DEACON And I signal exactly two hundred feet before the turn. Rule 108-1. The unimpressed Tester remains expressionless. DMV TESTER Great. Now after the right, I want you to parallel park in the open space. Deacon complies. DEACON I begin the parallel parking maneuver by pulling within three feet of the forward vehicle. I now shift into reverse while turning the wheel two revolutions clockwise... The Tester rubs his brow. 20   INT. DMV - DAY                                                     20 FLASH! Deacon's picture is taken. He passed.

EVERYONE Surprise! Deacon pretends to be surprised. DEACON Wow. This is great. The room is sparsely populated with a few of Deacon's RELATIVES, his MOM and DAD, younger brother MAX (14), and ROGER, a wheelchair-bound nerd with a face full of orthodontic headgear and braces. MATT Were you surprised?

DEACON Yeah. MATT Really? DEACON Really. I was. ROGER Happy birthday, Deacon. It's Lois Lane #2. Be careful. It's still in the wrapper. He hands Deacon a comic book, still in the plastic bag. DEACON Thanks. 23   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - LATER                                       23 Half-eaten cake and ice cream, unwrapped presents. Matt videotapes the event. MR. LEWIS Are you ready for the big present? DEACON (laying it on thick) You mean there's more? Deacon can hardly contain his excitement. MR. LEWIS It's in the garage. Come with us. He follows them, looking back knowingly at Fred and Matt. 24   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)                   24 The door opens, the lights come on, and Deacon's face drops. No new car. Instead, several large wrapped boxes. Deacon halfheartedly rips open the paper. MR. LEWIS It's a new computer system. You've been talking about it for months. But his Mom can see his expression. MRS. LEWIS What? That's not what you wanted? DEACON No, it is. It's just--

DEACON (in a trance) Oh, my God. There's Naomi. FRED She looks good. And there's NAOMI, every teenage boy's fantasy, wearing a hot party dress and drinking a cup of beer. Someone lightly bumps her... CLOSE ON her lips as the beer dribbles down her chin, and the world goes still . She playfully wipes the beer off her moistened lips and chin with the back of her hand. She turns her head and her hair floats in the air. DEACON AND FRED are zombies, completely mesmerized by her. FRED She spilled her beer. DEACON Yeah. Fred adjusts his pants. Deacon makes a decision. One that he'd normally never make. DEACON (CONT'D) I'm gonna go talk to her. What have I got to lose? FRED Your dignity? DEACON She's Rachael's friend. It's not like I don't know her. MATT Ask her if she has any unusual hats. Girls like that. Deacon gives Matt a dirty look. THE KEG AREA DEACON Hey, Naomi. NAOMI Happy Birthday, Deacon.

DEACON (pleasantly surprised) You remembered. NAOMI Well, I got this flyer and-- DEACON Oh, right. So where's Jake? NAOMI Like I care. DEACON (hopeful) So you two aren't going out any more? NAOMI Duh. Deacon's mind is racing with possibilities when: JAKE (O.S.) Freakin! It's Jake, back for another beer. JAKE (CONT'D) Hey, did you hear about Rachael Unger? Before Deacon can answer... JAKE (CONT'D) He shoots, he misses, right, ass- sphincter? Come on, Naomi. We're going in the pool. NAOMI Screw off. I'm talking to Deacon. JAKE Whatever. NAOMI Whatever. Jake gives Deacon a dirty look, nods a "let's go" to J.T. and Mark, and heads out back. NAOMI (CONT'D) What an asshole. As soon as Jake is out of sight, Deacon turns back to Naomi, but she's already gone, stranding Deacon. What just happened here? REVEAL Matt helping Roger drink a beer in the background.

28   EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER                              28 Deacon wanders out back. It's   very dark and there are several people in the pool, including   Jake's good-looking friends, Kelly, Wendy, J.T., and MARK.   It's hard to tell in the dark water, but it looks like they   might not be wearing any clothes. Deacon sees this and   starts to walk away. J.T. Deacon. I heard it was your birthday. Come on in the pool, man. DEACON No, that's okay. MARK No, seriously. It's cool. KELLY (come hither) Come on, Deacon. WENDY Yeah. Come on. Deacon thinks about it. He takes the metaphorical plunge. DEACON All right. He slips off his shoes and takes off his shirt. He walks over to the shallow end. Deacon steps in with his shorts still on. MARK Dude, what are you doing? Take off your clothes. DEACON What? WENDY We're skinny dipping, Deacon. He hesitates, not sure what to do. DEACON Oh. Okay. Sorry, I'll just leave you guys alone then-- KELLY --No, come on in. Join us. Wendy swims into J.T.'s arms. Her shoulders rise above the water and you can just make out the top of her breast. 
DORKY FRESHMAN Is this some kind of extortion racket? I'll pay you double if you can get me something today. DEACON I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do for a while. We don't have anything new. DORKY FRESHMAN I'm dying. I just need something. Just then, Naomi walks by on her way to the parking lot. DEACON Hey, Naomi. What are you up to? NAOMI Going home to cram for midterms. With a look, Deacon shoos away the freshman dork. DEACON Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you needed any help. NAOMI That's okay. I'll be all right. Deacon searches for something meaningful to say, desperate not to let the moment pass him by. Naomi cuts him some slack by asking, NAOMI (CONT'D) So where did Rachael go off to? DEACON She went to Paris with the French Club. (then, taking a chance) We're seeing other people. She laughs at his attempt at being nonchalant. But she's laughing with him, not at him, and Deacon can tell the difference. He relaxes... JAKE (O.S.) Hey, sphincter. ... just as Jake drives up to them. Deacon is starting to really get pissed at Jake ruining the moment with Naomi. DEACON Look, can you please stop calling me that? I think we're old enough to just let it go. All right? 
FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     24. 
JAKE Oh, sure. Sorry about that... Shit-pants. He looks at Naomi. JAKE (CONT'D) Hi, Naomi. NAOMI Whatever. She turns her back to Jake and his smile fades. He revs the engine and peels out BACKWARDS. Deacon jumps out of the way, but his bike is CRUSHED by the car. JAKE Oops. Sorry. He shifts gears and drives over the bike again. He laughs as he drives away. Naomi gives Deacon a pitying look and walks away. The moment is gone. Now Deacon is... 33   INT. AEROSTAR - DAY                                             33 ... pissed. His crushed bike is in the back seat. DEACON (emphatic) Look, mom. I need a car. MRS. LEWIS But I thought we agreed-- DEACON I need a car of my own. MRS. LEWIS Well, honey. A car is a lot of responsibility. DEACON Jesus, Mom. I'm seventeen now. I think I can handle it. MRS. LEWIS Well, it's also a lot of money. I'll tell you what. Maybe you can get an after school job to earn money for a car. I'll talk to your father. Deacon is stewing.

35   INT. FRED'S BEDROOM - DAY                                        35 CLOSE ON a web browser as the following URL is typed in: www.nicelookinggirlsthatgetnaked4U.com. The Cyber Granny parental block pops up. Denied. www.homeroomteachersdoingitbeforeschool.com Cyber Granny. Denied. www.ineedfreepornnow.org Denied. FRED Goddamn it. MATT Your dad really knows his firewalls. Deacon bursts into the room. FRED Hey, asshole. Don't just come barging in here. We could have been naked. Matt gives Fred a look. DEACON (excited) Shut up. I figured out how to get back on the Tony Montana track.... So, I'm at the zoo today... 36   EXT. ZOO - DAY                                                   36 A crowd of people (including Deacon's biology class) are watching something in the monkey cage. BIOLOGY TEACHER People! People! Come quickly. Witness the miracle of nature at its most primal. She's videotaping it, and Deacon looks up AT HER VIDEO VIEWFINDER. It's a monkey orgy. Masturbation and fornication everywhere. DEACON (V.O.) And these monkeys are doing it. I mean, they're going wild. And Miss Ariel is videotaping it. 
FRED Okay. Sure. I've thought about it. I've thought about shaving Principal Taggert's ass, too. A look, then Deacon gets up to seal the deal. DEACON Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn't let slip away. If we make this movie, it could be the best year of our lives. We'll go in boys and come out men. And at the end, we'll have the money, the power, and the women. But you losers would rather play it safe. Well, I'm not going to waste another minute. I'm making this porno movie with or without you. And when I show up at school in my new set of wheels, and you two limp dicks are begging me for my sloppy seconds, I'll just have to tell you, "Sorry, guys. That ship has sailed. You blew it." Ringing silence. MATT (sincerely) That was a really good speech, Deacon. DEACON Thanks. MATT Did you work that out before? DEACON No, Matt. FRED Okay... So say we were to do this. What would we call our company? MATT I've got it. "After School Special." They look at him. It's perfect. 38   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                                      38 WE FOLLOW a WOMAN dressed in a Fredericks of Hollywood type outfit, walking down the hallway past office suites; a mortgage company, a dentist, etc... She enters an office. As the door closes behind her, WE SEE the sign on the door, "Ramalot Productions."

39   INT. VIC'S "STUDIO" - CONTINUOUS                                39 A small, vertically integrated porno production company. Blow-ups of the company's box covers on the walls, hundreds of copies of titles on shelves, a small STAFF and two adjoining rooms. VIC RAMALOT, whose face we recognize from Dirty Darla #7, enters from the set. His partner, MIKE, helps him on with his robe. MIKE That was good. Some good action. VIC I've got a question for you Mike, and I want you to promise to be completely honest. MIKE Sure. Of course, Vic. Vic looks at him, vulnerable. VIC Do you think I'm too fat? MIKE Are you kidding? The camera loves you. VIC Seriously? MIKE Absolutely. VIC Thanks, man. Vic gives Mike a jive hand shake and the two do a little hug. Over Mike's shoulder, Vic sees the woman who's come into the office. VIC (CONT'D) Darla, sweetheart. Ready for number eight? Darla drops her top and heads for the bathroom. DARLA Sure, Vic, lemme freshen up first. VIC (to Mike) Is he in there? Mike nods, leading Vic through a door, into

40   INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                  40 where there's a terribly FRIGHTENED MAN (cameo for Ron Jeremy, etc.) tied to a chair with a gag in his mouth. Vic shakes his head, picking up a pair of rusty hedge clippers from the table. He snaps them open. VIC So, you think you can just walk into my town and move in on my territory? The Man takes a quick look down at his own crotch, fearing the worst. He shakes his head, pleading through his gag. 41   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY                                         41 The guys are huddled behind the frosted window of Fred's dad's office, standing away from the RECEPTIONIST. FRED We've got to have two forms of i.d. to prove she's over eighteen. DEACON How much money do we need? FRED A first time porno actress makes only two fifty to five hundred bucks. MATT That's it? Does that include the sex? DEACON Yes, Matt. MATT So how do we get women for this movie? FRED We place an ad in the Cleveland X-Press for "body models." That's like some sort of code word in the industry. MATT Are we supposed to have sex with these women? DEACON No, Matt. A NURSE walks in. NURSE Fred, your father wants you to take these urine samples down to the lab.

The Crack Whore makes her way over to them. They stare at her, slackjawed. DEACON Take a seat please. FRED Hi, I'm Balls McLongcock and this is Sam Slam. CRACK WHORE Tequila. You boys seem kind of young. DEACON Don't worry. We're old enough. FRED Tequila. Nice name. So, have you done any films before? CRACK WHORE I been in some home movies. Stuff like that. Some pictures. She tosses a stack of Polaroids at them. The top one has her standing next to a horse. Fred is speechless. DEACON Okay, then. I think we have what we need. We'll call you. She's confused. CRACK WHORE So you don't want me to suck you two off? They look at each other. DEACON No, I don't think that will be necessary at this time. FRED Maybe later. 46   INT. DEACON'S BASEMENT - LATER                                  46 The whores are gone. MATT Maybe if we put another ad in and say we're only looking for good looking models.

They look at him with disdain. FRED There's got to be another way to recruit porno actresses. 47   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                     47 FLASH! Three digital images of the guys are lined up on Deacon's computer monitor (thanks Mom and Dad!). Deacon is digitally altering the photo of Fred to give him a goatee. Matt's photo has already gotten mutton chops and Deacon's looking sweet with a fu-manchu. DEACON I say we make them from Hawaii. MATT Hawaii? DEACON It's perfect. Do you know what a Hawaii driver's license looks like? MATT No. DEACON Exactly. FRED But isn't it going to seem a little suspicious? Like why are we in Cleveland? DEACON Vacation. People from Cleveland vacation in Hawaii, where do you think people from Hawaii go? Matt and Fred look at each other. They shrug, then, MATT Aloha. 48   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT                         48 The next night. The three guys walk downstairs dressed in Hawaiian shirts. Deacon's parents are reading and Max is watching TV. DEACON Hey, mom. Can I borrow the car? MRS. LEWIS I have to go to the video store later.

DEACON But, mom. You said I could use the car, but it's never free. MRS. LEWIS All right, Deacon. I'll walk to the store. MAX Where are you guys going? DEACON Out. MR. LEWIS Why are you boys dressed like Don Ho? FRED This is the new style, Mr. Lewis. MAX Yeah, for ass-wranglers. MRS. LEWIS Max! 49    INT. AEROSTAR - NIGHT                                               49 Inside the car (still in the garage), the three guys apply their fake facial hair to match their three new fake i.d.'s. FRED Are we really going to do this? DEACON Oh, yeah. He starts the ignition, and an EASY LISTENING tune blasts on the radio, ruining the moment. The guys look at each other for a beat, then Deacon quickly changes the station to a ROCKING SONG, and get back into the mood for adventure. DEACON (CONT'D) (once again) Oh, yeah. They pull out and drive off. 49A   EXT. CLEVELAND - NIGHT                                             49A The minivan descends out of the suburbs into the lights of the big city below. 50    EXT.

The song ends, the curtain comes up, and Fred is smiling ear to ear. The Stripper gets dressed and Fred pays her. AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER You want another dance? FRED Uh, not right now, thank you. I have to go to the bathroom. He tries to get up, but the Stripper stop him. AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER Well how about you buy me a drink? FRED Okay. She sits down on Fred's lap. Right on his boner. FRED (CONT'D) Uhhhhh. AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER (to the waitress) Seven and seven. MATT You want mine? She laughs. AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER So what brings you boys to the Pretty Kitty? MATT We're from Hawaii. DEACON Actually, we're filmmakers. We're here looking for new talent. AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER Really? DEACON Yeah, we're looking for some beautiful ladies looking to break into film. You interested? AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER No. They look defeated.

AMERICAN FLAG STRIPPER (CONT'D) But I know someone who is. A beat, then time stands still once more for our heroes as ASHLEY makes her entrance. She looks barely legal, dressed in a Catholic school girl outfit, and walks up to them. ASHLEY Hi, I'm Ashley. You guys are filmmakers? MATT Video actually. They won't let me shoot on film. Deacon pulls out his wad of cash. DEACON Look. We're paying top dollar, hetero only, no anal, and we're distributing through our web site. ASHLEY Aren't you kind of young? DEACON Aren't you? You know we're going to need two forms of i.d. to prove you're over eighteen. ASHLEY I'm eighteen. Don't worry. FRED Then you're hired. MATT Shouldn't we audition her first? ASHLEY Don't worry. You guys relax and have a few drinks. By the time the night's over, you'll know I'm your girl. STRIP CLUB MONTAGE: 51A   INT.

VIC'S "STUDIO" - DAY                                           52 A LADY dressed in sexy clothes and eating chicken wings from a huge bucket is waiting around on the set, but Vic is over talking to Mike. VIC Someone's been recruiting new talent. MIKE Jimmy Rimmer says they're from Hawaii. VIC Why the hell would someone from Hawaii come to Cleveland? 
MATT A stripper. Her name's Ashley. He pulls out Ashley's picture from his manila folder. Jake checks it out. His eyes go wide and suddenly he's their new best friend. JAKE Who's the guy? A beat. JAKE (CONT'D) Well, maybe I could do it. DEACON No, that's not a good idea. JAKE Why not? FRED It's a lot harder than it looks. JAKE You don't think I can do it? Trust me, I've nailed enough girls. DEACON Forget it. JAKE Look, you little butt munch. I want to do this, and if you don't let me, I'll go and tell your mommy what kind of sick shit you're doing. Jake looks him over. 54   INT. BASEMENT SET AS "YEARBOOK OFFICE" - DAY                    54 DARKNESS. Click. The lights come on. The big day has come at last. The guys are nervously conferring on one side of the room, far away from Ashley, who's standing alone, dressed in a conservative high school girl's outfit. The basement has been transformed into the guys' idea of a movie set, complete with lights, camera, tripod, and sound equipment. A desk and decoration make the room look roughly like the high school yearbook offices. Deacon gives Matt a little shove, and Matt takes a long walk over to Ashley.

MATT So, um, I'll be directing. ASHLEY Okay. MATT Okay. So I want you to play this very understated. It's a very visceral scene, so it's important not to play it too over the top. ASHLEY Uh huh. (beat) Hey, did you guys shave or something? Deacon looks at the other two, all three now beardless. DEACON Okay. I think we're ready here. Fred awkwardly picks up the boom and puts his earphones on. MATT Boom in position. FRED What? Deacon pushes him over to position. MATT Ashley, get into position. Matt gets behind the camera. They whisper conspiratorially. One last reality check before they take the leap. FRED Are we actually going to do this? They look over at Ashley. She's waiting. DEACON I guess so. They return to position. MATT So, um, we're starting with the masturbation and then Phillip, the yearbook editor, is going to surprise you. ASHLEY Okay.

MATT And ... action. ASHLEY (wooden) These yearbook photos of the Debate Club are making me so hot. I can't help myself. THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY, Ashley slowly strips off her clothes. But before we get too good a look, we REVERSE ANGLE FRED smiles ear to ear. DEACON gulps. MATT peers out from behind the camera. ASHLEY (O.S.) I hope no one catches me because I forgot to lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, yeah. FRED's smile turns into nervous ogling. DEACON crosses his legs and adjusts his shorts. MATT wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. Deacon whispers, DEACON Close up. MATT What? DEACON Close up. MATT Oh yeah. Right. And Matt zooms in. Ashley continues moaning and as Matt gets closer, the camera starts shaking. He can't keep his hands steady. 54A   THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY                                       54A We'd love to get a look, but the camera is shaking so much, it's just a BLUR.

MATT Deacon, come quick. Deacon steps away from his class for a moment. DEACON Matt, what's wrong? BIOLOGY TEACHER (O.S.) Like all mammals, the whale gives birth to live young. Can anyone name another characteristic of mammals? Vinnie? FRED Our site got linked by another bigger site. Someone must have seen our stories and liked them. DEACON And? MATT We got a few more pre-orders and a ton of hits. DEACON How many? MATT Guess. DEACON A thousand? FRED Twelve thousand. DEACON Holy shit! Deacon high-fives the other two. They're all stoked. FRED We need to hurry up and make this movie. MATT We should go over the schedule for tomorrow. And make sure the script is ready. Deacon's smile fades. DEACON Uh, I can't tonight guys. FRED Why? Where are you going?

DEACON It's this thing I have to go to. MATT Is it a travelling carnival? DEACON No. Look, it's this party Naomi invited me to. MATT Can we come? Fred picks up on Deacon's hesitation. This isn't good. DEACON Uh... Okay. I guess that's cool. An awkward beat. DEACON (CONT'D) I want you guys to come. It's just, I don't know. I kind of had this vibe from Naomi. MATT (still doesn't get it) We can just meet you there. DEACON Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Look, it's at Mark and J.T. Slistak's house. I'll see you guys there. I've got to get back to class. MATT Later. Deacon walks back to the group. MATT (CONT'D) What are you wearing to the party? FRED We're not really going to the party, you moron. MATT Why not? FRED Because I said so. Matt starts getting agitated.

MATT But we told Deacon-- I mean, we can't just not show up. What if Deacon is looking for us-- This is too complicated to explain to Matt, so Fred just gives in. FRED All right. All right. Stop crying already. We'll make an appearance. MATT Cool. 66   INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        66 Amid this raging party, Deacon has taken his rightful place with the in-crowd, standing dangerously close to Naomi without his usual sidekicks weighing him down. Finally. NAOMI You know, Rachael's coming back from Paris in a couple of weeks. DEACON So? NAOMI So, aren't you even a little interested in seeing her? DEACON No. There's someone else I'd rather see... He looks into her eyes, waiting to see if the limb he's out on is going to break. She smiles. It's working. Just then, MATT Hey, guys. It's his sidekicks and they've got some seriously bad timing. Deacon shoots them an annoyed look. NAOMI So what's this project you guys are working on? FRED We can't really talk about it. JAKE (O.S.) Yeah. It's private. Jake eyes Deacon intently. 
DEACON I think Ashley's busy tonight-- ASHLEY Okay. Oh, shit. MRS. LEWIS Okay, then. 74   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                           74 Ashley is eating dinner with the Lewises. Max keeps staring at her. Mr. Lewis steals a few glances of Ashley himself while continuing his work-related rant. MR. LEWIS So get this. Johnson comes up to me today and he's all like "where's the ND-90's?" I'm like, "Johnson, they discontinued the ND-90 like six weeks ago." I've been telling this guy... ASHLEY Johnson sounds like a moron. MR. LEWIS Exactly! Mr. Lewis is psyched that someone is finally paying attention to him. Mrs. Lewis doesn't like the way he's looking at her. MRS. LEWIS So, Ashley. If I could ask you a personal question, exactly how old are you? ASHLEY Nineteen. But I tell people eighteen. Deacon laughs nervously. DEACON Isn't that funny? The doorbell rings. DEACON (CONT'D) I'll get it. FOYER Deacon open the door. It's Naomi. DEACON What are you doing here?

NAOMI I thought I'd come by and surprise you. Maybe we could hang out in your bedroom. She looks at him seductively. Deacon looks over his shoulder. DEACON Now's not a good time. NAOMI What's wrong? DEACON Nothing. Let's talk later. He tries to close the door, but she stops it. MRS. LEWIS (O.S.) Deacon, who is it? Too late. Naomi comes in. NAOMI Hi, Mrs. Lewis. I'm Naomi. I'm Deacon's girlfriend. And with that she looks at Deacon, figuring she just made his day. It fails, however, to achieve the desired effect. MRS. LEWIS His girlfriend? She looks at Deacon. Max pokes his head through. MAX Deacon has two girlfriends? DEACON Shut up, Max! NAOMI What do you mean? What's going on? MAX Deacon's other girlfriend is having dinner with us. DEACON I can explain. Naomi walks into the kitchen with Max. MAX This is Deacon's other girlfriend, Ashley.

MR. LEWIS His other girlfriend? Dad's beaming with pride. The two girls size each other up. ASHLEY Hi. NAOMI Oh, my God. How old are you, you slut? ASHLEY Eighteen. NAOMI I thought you were a nice guy. Naomi storms out of the house. Deacon follows, then Ashley. MRS. LEWIS You need to have a talk with him. He could be having S-E-X. MR. LEWIS I need to give him a goddamn medal. (she storms off) What? FOYER Deacon watches Naomi go. Ashley consoles him. ASHLEY Let her go. DEACON Are you insane? I've been fantasizing about Naomi Feldman since the seventh grade. ASHLEY Fantasy and reality are two different things, Deacon. Don't fall in love with who you think she is. You have to be sure you love the real person. DEACON So what should I do? ASHLEY Go after her then. Or don't. Whatever. He looks at Ashley for a beat, then goes after Naomi. 75   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                             75 Naomi and Deacon are arguing under a street light.

Fred exchanges a glance with Matt. DEACON (CONT'D) And I wanted her to help out. Give the script a female point of view. Fred pulls Deacon aside. FRED Jesus, Deacon. Didn't you see that Beatles documentary on the History Channel? You're pulling a Yoko Ono on us. DEACON What? FRED Fine. Whatever. Let's get started. I'm sure she'll be really helpful. Coop comes out of the bathroom dressed as the Math Team Captain, complete with nerd glasses, pocket protector, etc. COOP Oh, hey, Naomi. NAOMI Hey, Coop. Are you helping these guys, too? COOP (sheepishly) Sort of. MATT Okay, people. Places everybody. Let's try to do this with a little heart, okay? And action. Everyone turns to their scripts and starts the rehearsal. ASHLEY This quadratic equation is so hard. COOP Well, maybe we should just stick to long division. Coop drops his corduroys and Naomi gasps. She stares at Coop's "slide rule" for a beat, then snaps out of it. NAOMI Wait a second. Cut. This is all wrong. She wouldn't be fantasizing about some geek.

MATT He's not a geek. He's the Math Team Captain. NAOMI No, he should be really well-dressed, and maybe he's a foreign exchange student from Portugal. MATT Um, and the director is the only one who's allowed to say "cut." FRED Who cares, Naomi? NAOMI Deacon agrees with me, don't you? Matt and Fred look at Deacon. COOP Dudes, come on. My nuts are getting cold. ASHLEY I'm out of here. NAOMI Shut up, Coop. This is important. COOP (swings his arms out) And my nuts aren't? Coop's hand accidentally smacks Ashley in the nose as she's getting up. She SCREAMS. DEACON Are you okay? COOP I'm sorry, Ashley. She's pissed, holding her nose. ASHLEY Look. This is ridiculous. Who does dress rehearsals for a porno shoot? MATT Oh, sure. Why don't we throw out the script while we're at it and "improvise."

ASHLEY Guys, I appreciate the money. It's nice to get paid for sitting around doing nothing, but this isn't helping my career. I've got no footage for my reel. She packs up. FRED Where are you going? ASHLEY Sorry. She leaves. COOP Ashley, wait. I'm sorry. Ashley! Then, he blurts out something unexpected: COOP (CONT'D) (calling after her) I love you! Coop exchanges an awkward glance with the guys: he's said too much. He goes after Ashley, with his pants still around his ankles and his bare ass in full display. He stumbles on his pants and falls on his face. He gets up quickly and continues after her, still with his pants down. FRED Now what are we going to do? Your "girlfriend" ruined everything. DEACON Coop's the one that smacked her. NAOMI Besides, if you losers knew anything about women, we wouldn't have this problem. FRED Who asked you? NAOMI I don't have to take this. She storms off, leaving Deacon there to make a decision. He looks at Matt and Fred for a beat, then follows Naomi. Fred and Matt are crushed. 80   EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - DAY                                80 Ashley is walking through the parking lot on the way to work. 
Naomi's HAND presses up against the window. It slowly falls to the ground. FRED (V.O.) It's a basic rule of porno. JUMP CUT TO: Back on the bed, Naomi is in a state of complete bliss, having had her first ever orgasm. ASHLEY (V.O.) Fantasy and reality are two different things... But Deacon doesn't share Naomi's contentment. He looks troubled. 83A   INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                     83A The next night, Deacon is talking to Ashley backstage as she's getting ready to go on. DEACON I don't know. It was weird. Is it supposed to be so weird? ASHLEY Of course it was weird. True love can only exist between two women. Deacon is stunned. ASHLEY (CONT'D) Just kidding. I don't know, Deacon. Do you like this girl? He hesitates a bit too long. DEACON Of course I do. ASHLEY Your heart is telling you that you don't. And I think it's time you start listening to your heart. Deacon still doesn't get it. ASHLEY (CONT'D) Look. I have to go on. Just do whatever you want. Or don't. Whatever.

VIDEO DUPE GUY Hey, Dave, there's a guy on the phone who wants to set up a new account. DAVE What's it for? VIDEO DUPE GUY Some outfit called After School Special. They turn back.

NAOMI What's wrong? DEACON I have to meet up with Matt and Fred this afternoon. I already blew them off yesterday. NAOMI Deacon, you don't have to hang out with those guys any more. Besides, you really need a facial. And I mean, I thought we could spend the day together. You know, after last night. DEACON But what about Matt and Fred? NAOMI Well what about me? She pouts.

Matt calls "Okay, people. Places. Let's get it together." Plantain puts the cigarette out on her heel, hides the tuna fish sandwich in her purse, and sprays the air with Weylon J. Petunia's.

KELLY AND WENDY No. ASHLEY You're wasting your time giving those Neanderthals blowjobs. I mean, they'll probably wind up unemployed wife beaters anyway. KELLY So, are Deacon's friends seeing anybody? ASHLEY Matt and Fred? I don't think so. But if you're interested, you better move fast. Those guys know how to do this thing ... She whispers something to Wendy and Kelly. They look shocked. Ashley walks off... 100A   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT                                      100A ...and finds Deacon, sitting alone on a broken-down ride. She sits down next to him. ASHLEY How's Naomi? DEACON I don't know. Good, I guess.

ASHLEY I thought she was your fantasy girl. DEACON Yeah. She was. ASHLEY You're gonna dump her. DEACON I don't want to. I don't know. It's not like it was when I was with Rachael. Rachael and I used to talk about stuff. We just, I don't know, connected. ASHLEY Very good, Deacon. Deacon is confused. DEACON What do you mean? ASHLEY Oh, nothing. I guess I'm just glad that you finally figured it out. A moment of realization. DEACON Yeah, I guess I did. (beat) So I have to do this, don't I? ASHLEY (joking this time) I guess. Or not. Whatever. Deacon smiles. He finally understands that Ashley really does care about him. Ashley kisses him on the cheek and exits off into the horizon. 101   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT                                      101 Deacon holds Naomi's hand and they walk and talk. DEACON There's something I want to talk to you about. NAOMI What? DEACON I've been thinking. Maybe we should see other people.

CRANE SHOT up to the second floor landing. 110B   INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                  110B Deacon, Matt, and Fred are bound and gagged, and hanging by their pants from meat hooks. Mike takes their gags off and they starts whimpering. MATT Please don't kill us, Mr. Porno Man. VIC Relax. We're not going to kill you. The guys let out a collective sigh of relief. Thank God. A beat. Then Mike pulls out the HEDGE CLIPPERS. MIKE (matter of fact) We're going to cut your balls off. FRED What?!? The guys freak out, but Mike's gun keeps them in place. VIC (re: Fred) Start with him. FRED Why me? It was all Deacon's idea! DEACON FRED! VIC Okay. Do the leader kid. MIKE Quit squirming. It hurts a lot more if you struggle. Vic starts undoing Deacon's belt. DEACON Wait! Wait! Wait! VIC Come on, kid. Take it like a man. Vic pulls down Deacon's pants. Mike brings the blades together in a menacing practice chop. 
He looks around frantically. He runs into the 117A   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS)           117A where his parents are sitting there waiting for him. He can tell by their expression, they know. MR. LEWIS Looking for something in the mail, Deacon? DEACON No, I just-- MR. LEWIS Maybe something you'd rather not have us see. Deacon goes white. DEACON Mom, Dad... MRS. LEWIS It's too late, Deacon. DEACON Wait-- MRS. LEWIS We just want you to know how deeply disappointed we are in you. DEACON I can explain. MR. LEWIS Explain? Explain? DEACON If you'll just give me a chance... MR. LEWIS How are you going to explain this? He holds up the REPORT CARD. MRS. LEWIS How did you manage to get a "C" in biology? Deacon is in shock: relieved, confused, and a little angry. MRS. LEWIS (CONT'D) I knew we shouldn't have let him have a girlfriend--

MR. LEWIS Let alone two-- DEACON Is that what this is about? My biology class? It's just a stupid midterm grade. MR. LEWIS I don't like your tone, mister. DEACON Mom, Dad. I'm seventeen now. I'm driving. I've got a girlfriend. Well, actually, we broke up. But you guys treat me like a kid. Is it too much to ask for to be a normal teenager with a normal life? MRS. LEWIS You broke up with Ashley? DEACON No. Naomi. Look. I just want to have fun with my friends, okay? They look him over. Finally, MR. LEWIS Okay, then. Just make sure you don't repeat this performance on your finals. DEACON I won't. Relieved, he walks out into the Foyer. Max appears from around the corner with the tape. They walk together. DEACON (CONT'D) How much do you know? MAX Pretty much everything. Mr. Slam. Max hands him a piece of paper. MAX (CONT'D) These are my demands. He looks them over. DEACON Done. (beat) Did you know all along? MAX Are you kidding? Who do you think made the first pre-order?

Max hands him the tape and they shake hands. Deacon turns to Matt and Fred waiting in the foyer. They're relieved. CUT TO: 118   FRED'S FACE                                                      118 FRED I'm really nervous. DEACON puts his arm around his shoulders. DEACON My advice is to go slow. If you feel you're losing control, just try to relax. Don't worry. It's easier than it looks. PULL BACK to reveal we're in INT. DMV - DAY Fred is about to take his driving test. FLASH! Fred gets his picture taken. 119   EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - DAY                                        119 Deacon drives the minivan home and pulls in next to the brand new convertible sports car. Deacon gets out, excited. MR. LEWIS What do you think? DEACON This is for me? MR. LEWIS Are you crazy? It's for me. You want a new car, you get an after school job. Deacon's Mom is wearing a sexy outfit and carries an overnight bag. She's beaming. MRS. LEWIS But we are letting you have the Aerostar. It may not be "cool," but it'll get you where you're going. DEACON Thanks, guys. Really. MRS. LEWIS We're going away for the weekend. Your father surprised me!

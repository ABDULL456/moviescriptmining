EXT. CROWD SCENES. VARIOUS. 
A massive crowd, it could be a sports stadium, a u2 farewell show or new year's eve on copacabana beach, but whatever it is there are thousands and thousands of us. A mexican wave erupts success, celebration, with so many involved it's impossible to pick out anyone individually. Critical mass cyclists, easter crowds at st. Peter's basilica, nyc marathon, 4,000 flash mobbers doing the silent disco at london's victoria station, india's kumbh mela, macy's thanksgiving day parade, raves, subway parties, the daytona 500. . . . Gradually the screen splits into 2, and then 3, though at times there appears to be no division at all. 
EXT. FREEWAY. NIGHT. 
An overhead shot of a crammed freeway gives way to a single vehicle, a 98 Toyota Tacoma, red and white with a topper. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT. 
Cut inside as Aron Ralston, 27 cuts off the freeway. 
TRIPTYCH. 
OPENING TITLES ARE A SERIES OF TRIPTYCHS FEATURING ALL THE TITLE CARDS EXCEPT THE MAIN ONE. THEY BLEND, OVERLAP AND ARE INTERCUT WITH ADVERTS SOME FROM THE BILLBOARDS ARON'S VAN PASSES, SOME FROM TELEVISION AND SOME FROM THE RADIO. AND, OF COURSE, ALL THESE INTERCUT WITH ARON AND HIS TRUCK. AND THE LANDSCAPE. 
A TITLE CARD READS: 'Utah. The Canyonlands. The slickrock desert. The red dust and the burnt cliffs and the lonely sky-all that which lies beyond the end of the roads.' 
Edward Abbey. Desert Solitaire. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROAD. NIGHT. 
Eventually Aron's truck is now alone on an interstate road. 
INT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT. 
At the southwest edge of Green River, Aron Ralston drives under the interstate into a landscape of obscurity. He looks to his right and left, not a single light perforates the absolute blackness of the San Rafael Desert. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT. 
From high above, three quarters of the screen is black and we see his truck's lights running parallel with the blackness. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT. 
A sign flashes by: Next Service: 110 miles America's challengers for the Tour de France flash by in a pack of 15 or so neon spirits. Night training. 
10PM. 
A BLM sign indicates that Horseshoe Canyon Trailhead is 47 miles ahead through the desert darkness. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PARKING AREA. NIGHT. 
Ghostly, but there are three other vehicles and two encampments at the Trailhead, despite signs prohibiting camping. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARON'S TRUCK. NIGHT. 
He turns off the music and waits for a head to pop out or a light to come on but they have all turned in. Ghostly. He glides to a flat spot near the sign board welcoming visitors to the Horseshoe Canyon quadrant of Canyonlands National Park. He whips into the back of the truck and flings everything out of the way of his sleeping bag and pad. Black. 
END OF TRIPTYCH TITLE SEQUENCE. 
CUT TO: 
BLACK. 
But no rest. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARON'S TRUCK. DAY. 
The doors smash open to reveal a glorious day and Aron's bike careers into it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT. VARIOUS. 
It's still like a wild road movie, but now on a bicycle. Having parked his motorized transport he ploughs into the land like an ad for extreme sports. Past bikers, he vanishes temporarily in their dust cloud, he wears a bandana across his face as the bikers pass by... a final telephone box, past remnants of those who tried to settle or work this unforgiving land; Aborigines, frontier settlers, ranchers... all driven away from a heartland he ploughs into....... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT. CU on ARON. Wearing a pair of beat-up running shoes and thick wool-blend socks, Lycra biking shorts and a Phish tee shirt he has a back pack with equipment but hydrates through a gallon of water stored in an insulated three litre CamelBak hydration pouch which he sucks on without stopping. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT. DAY. 
His bike pummels the canyon landscape and you get a sense of the exhilaration this man gets from pitting himself alone against what nature can offer. He's clearly a fit and daring young man and these are his kicks. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT. DAY. 
Even uphill he hammers his way up the sandstone. Gasping for oxygen, his legs screaming for rest, he pushes and pushes until the crest and then down, down, instant speed and he can suck on his water again. Part of a massive clan who define themselves not by what they are, but by what they do. In a way, he's an action movie personified and the opening should be shot and cut to provide adrenaline in spadefuls. 
Until... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT. DAY. 
Suddenly, he hits a sand trap and hurtles forward over the handle bars, face first into the sand, his toe clips and momentum brings the bike with him. The bike has him trapped on the desert floor like a takedown in wrestling. He submits, landing nose deep in the sand. He sits up, looks around quickly to see if anyone saw. Pulls out his camera from his bag and takes a a self-portrait snap of the mess. 
CUT TO: 
ARON Solitude. Great tunes. Empty mind. He indicates the wilderness. 
ARON (CONT'D) And I can sing Phish songs as loud as I like. 
MEGAN Phish? 
KRISTI Not those guys from... 
ARON Yeah, I know, I know. 
(LAUGHS) See, that's why I'm on my own. Nobody likes me or my band. They laugh as he goofs for them. He gathers all their packaging and stuffs it in his backpack. 
ARON (CONT'D) I'll get this. Leave no trace. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BLUE JOHN CANYON. DAY. 
They're walking again. 
ARON (CONT'D) Hey, but I like a beer like the next man. You know, end of the day. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CANYON. GULLEY. 
They're negotiating a steep gulley. Aron is 1/2 way down, Megan at the top, Kristi on her way down to him. 
ARON I'm not certified yet but that's what I want to do. 
MEGAN An illegal instructor. 
ARON It's hard to get the hours to qualify. Catch 22. 
KRISTI Well, we'll sign your time-card today. 
ARON Great. Now put your ass on my head. 
KRISTI Okay but don't look and no grabbing now, if I do... 
MEGAN Oh whatever, you love it. 
KRISTI Shhh! 
Aron then quickly slips to the bottom. Megan is way high, Kristi half way. 
ARON (at his most instructor- ish, talking all the time as he makes his way down) You'll have to chimney down a little ways - like here, watch - one foot on each wall then squat onto your right heel, now your butt's on the wall, so you can move your right foot across, now put your left foot under your butt lower down and scootch your butt down - watch that black part, it's slick, slime, try not to get it on your shoes - if you can get to these bomber handholds here it's like an elevator shaft and just think friction to control the slide. This is a keeper so always have someone at the bottom to boost you out. He looks up to them. 
MEGAN I didn't understand any of that. 
EXT. CONJUNCTION OF BLUE JOHN CANYON, WEST FORK, EAST FORK. 
LATER IN THE DAY. 2PM-ISH They come to a clear fork in the paths. He watches them turn their map round and round. 
MEGAN (CONT'D) Kristi, I think this is our way back. 
... to see the slot canyon, back and back and back, nothing more than a dry crack in the surface of this massive land. Gradually his cries for help become inaudible. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. 
He unpacks everything with great energy, like a stocktake, and lays it all out on the surface of the rock; 
chocolate bar wrappers and bakery bag with crumbs of chocolate muffin inside that he volunteered to take away on behalf of the girls, 2 small bean burritos, cd player, cds , extra AA batteries, mini digital video camcorder, small multi- use tool and 3 LED headlamp. 
CUT TO: 
BIG C/U: VARIOUS. ... of all these elements - these are now his only companions and their POV of him reflects that as he tests each one for its potential, opening all the blades and laying them out to look at them; sunglasses - scratched, bike Ulok key, rock climbing harness, cloth goggles bag, rapelling equipment, water bottle, car keys, plastic grocery bag, empty de- hydration pack, money, credit cards, green and yellow climbing rope in black zippers bag, a stick, stones and sand. Everything. 
Pause. He stares at it all and it all stares back at him. 
CUT TO: 
C/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS. 
3.28, changes to 3.29 
HARD ENERGY CUT 
TO: 
INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. 
Inside the tiny gap we see... his headlamp flick on to let him assess the rock and the wall and his hand in between it. He picks a point and begins to chip away with the knife. He's back - energy, movement, purpose, action makes him happy. He occasionally stops to look at his left hand, swollen and puffy and constantly in need of flexing. He gets into a rhythm of 'tick,tick,tick', flex and back again, `tick,tick,tick' 
CUT TO: 
TIGHTER C/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS. 4.19pm, changes to 4.20 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. 
In a huge close up of this eye he can see in the foreground that there's a pile of steel filings from the knife itself, almost as big as the dust from the ground - 
ARON Not good. He blows the whole lot into our face with a mighty gust. 
ARON (CONT'D) When in a hole.... Alternative; he starts digging away at the wall instead, same result. 
ARON (CONT'D) Fuck. It's hard as iron. Pause. 
You're gonna have to cut your arm off. 
As if to answer that idea we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. 
Tapping a rock in his hand onto the top of the knife as he balances it against the wall or with his mouth. Weird close angles as he almost taps the side of his eye socket. Suddenly, he hammers down with ten times more force onto the handle of the knife, the rock explodes in his hand, showering pick dust over everything, and bouncing the knife off the rock. Once again, gravity takes over. The knife hits his shorts and as he moves to grab it, he misses it and knocks it further round the back of his leg. He pivots and turns to try and catch it but gravity is quicker than his restricted twist and it falls into a hole between the rounded rocks near his left foot - 
MARK Wow, look at the size of this one. There's no cliffs or mountains anywhere near. We look at Mark's pleasant, unremarkable face for far too long as he looks around - 
MARK (CONT'D) How the fuck did this get there? It's like we're on the moon looking over Buzz Aldrin's shoulder at Neil Armstrong; it certainly sounds like that... 
HARD CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON FLOOR. NIGHT. 
Chip,chip,chip; stretches his arm, flexes his legs, tick,tick,tick. He changes the blade, prising suddenly at a section of the rock with his file. It bites and a dime size shred chip of rock arcs through the night light. He catches it perfectly on his right elbow. 
ARON Cool. He picks it off his arm and places it on top of the rock next to where he's working. It's a grain of sand on the seashore but it's something. 
Boy, his arm and his legs are aching now. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ABOVE ARON, LOOKING DOWN INTO CANYON. NIGHT. 
He's stepped into his harness and is throwing 30ft of rope up towards us. There's a tangle of knots and carabiners looking for purchase close to camera. Each time it falls back all the way. He persists, each time, varying his line of attack fractionally. Finally it catches. 
He pulls gently at first, then fiercely, it holds and we slide softly and slowly down the rope and as we reach him he gently takes the weight off his feet finally. 
ARON Aahhhhh. 
Lovely relief for him, light off, his eyes close. 
CUT TO: 
INT/EXT VARIOUS. DAY. A re-run of the accident. He can now witness it in detail as though it were planned and his role is to point us where to look. 3 seconds become 30... We fall with his face in high definition slow motion watching his future. We fall with the rock pitilessly chasing him down to the floor of the canyon. As he lands... 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. PRE DAWN. 
... His eyes open and he stands unsteadily rubbing at his legs, the lack of circulation has forced him up. Doesn't think about the dream, starts chipping again. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. TIME-LAPSE. DAWN. 
Lit only by his lamp, the black shifts to grey and then there's light. He watches it arrive. A rush of wind. Something flaps and he looks up sharply - 
RAVEN Caw-caw. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SKY. DAY. 
A black raven flies symmetrically the length of the canyon slit above him. Blue, blue sky. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. 
ARON Caw-caw. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO FOOTAGE. 
ARON What you're looking at there is my arm, going into the rock... and there it is, stuck. It's been without circulation for 24 hours. 
(MORE) 
ARON (CONT'D) It's pretty well gone. If the colour doesn't come across on the video, it's grey and blue. 
ARON (CONT'D) Unnhhhhh.......I'm in deep stuff. 
ARON (CONT'D) So I have very little water. He can't help look in the camera towards those who know what that means in this place. 
ARON (CONT'D) Yeah, I have about a third of a litre left. He picks up the water bottle and shakes it for the camera. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT/EXT. VARIOUS. CANYON. DAY. 
Different angle on the freeze-frame. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. VIDEO FOOTAGE. 
ARON So the way I see it... there's kind of four things happening here... I tried to move it with some rigging... useless... and I tried chipping away at the rock... I think part of the problem is, is that my hand is actually supporting the rock. Which means every time I chip away the rock moves a bit and settles onto my hand again. I can't feel it happening but microscopically, it seems to be, because the little gap over there between the rock and the wall seems to be getting smaller. And this chockstone is the hardest thing here. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WIDE. MOVING THROUGH CANYON. REALTIME. 
A breeze slides through the canyon and he shudders involuntarily for five seconds. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO FOOTAGE. 
ARON So the third thing left was to cut my arm off. 
PAUSE 
ARON (CONT'D) I don't know whether I could do that but it's pretty much suicide. It's four hours to my vehicle that way and with very difficult climbing with one hand and the bike is like two, two and a half hours, that way but the climbing... fourth class climbing... which I think will be probably impossible with one hand... between the blood loss and the dehydration I think I would die if I cut off my arm. 
ARON (CONT'D) Which means I'm waiting for someone to come along. He summons up the guts to let the evidence out. 
ARON (CONT'D) I didn't tell anyone where I was going and I didn't leave a note on the truck. 
ARON (CONT'D) Dumb. The video whirrs on until he suddenly looks straight into the lens. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. REALTIME. 
He hears voices. 
He rewinds to the end of the message and erases his futile calls for help. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ARON'S TRUCK. DAY. 
Aron's Truck. We sense him in the cab but we're not inside with him yet. Music loud and pulsing as we travel towards the inflatable Scooby Doo. It's 12ft tall, powered by a mini- generator. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARON'S TRUCK. DAY. 
Aron swerves to affect the figure which buckles and flaps in his after-draft. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROAD. DAY. 
We stay with the dancing figure as his truck drives away into the landscape. The generator fan rattles on as the booming bass of the truck fades. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. 
You can see him thinking. Will the girls go to the party? 
EXT. GOOGLE-EARTH SATELLITE SHOT OF WILDERNESS. DUSK. 
We're now high above the desert, and in the time-lapse we see the soft, grey, endless line of darkness cross right to left

A flashing, strobe-ing light - Aron's head-lamp bouncing back and forth off the canyon walls - but also, as he continues to chip away... 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. CANYON. NIGHT. 
...jump-cutting, strobe-lit as though by flash, of Aron madly dressing for the night. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
C/U: WATCH 
We see the thermometer on his watch falling down and down from 70 => below 50. 
ARON Always do.

C/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS 11:59 => 00.00 in huge, luminous figures. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. NIGHT. 
He pulls his bag off and pulls his water bottle out of the ground where he has half-buried it. It won't open. He can't unscrew it. He mutters, cursing himself for tightening the lid too much. He puts it between his teeth and levers with his head, but nothing. Is his strength vanishing so quickly? 
He looks at his puffy left hand... there's a tremble in it. He shakes it to get rid of the tremble and jams the bottle between his legs. He uses a bit of cloth to give his hand better purchase on the top. We're tight on the neck of the bottle as it releases, finally and he lifts it, slowly, almost ceremonially. Controlling the tilt, a half-mouthful of water slides onto his tongue. He tilts the bottle back towards upright but not the whole way. He waits. Circulating the splash of water around his mouth. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. C/U: BOTTLE NECK 
The bottle neck stares at Aron. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. C/U: ARON 
... his eyes staring at the bottle neck. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. NIGHT. 
He still holds the water in his mouth as he rewinds the top onto the bottle and reburies it in the sand to stop any evaporation. He moves to pop his contact lenses into his mouth and wash them in the moisture. First one then the other as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARON'S APARTMENT. DAY. 
The images shift with the lens change back to his apartment, daylight, we sense him though he's probably in the shower. His ansaphone clicks in. 
ANSAPHONE (MOM) Aron, it's Mom. Hoping to catch you. Nothing urgent. Dad's in New York so it'll be a quiet weekend. Aron is clearly there but can't answer. 
ANSAPHONE (MOM) (CONT'D) Call me. Lots of love. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARON'S APARTMENT. DAY. 
In front of his bathroom mirror he's slipping his lenses in for the day. It looks like The Man Who Fell To Earth.

VIDEO MESSAGE TWO. INTERCUT WITH LIVE FOOTAGE. 
Aron trying not to look at himself: 
ARON It's freaking me out looking at myself so I hope you guys are OK with this 
PAUSE 
CUT TO: 
REALTIME: 
We can see 2 images of him when we go behind the balanced video on the rock, as he has deliberately turned the screen away from himself. 
CUT TO: 
VIDEO: 
ARON It's Monday - all day - bummer. I spent the morning trying to create a 6:1 system ration and lift the boulder but friction between the rope and carabiners is dissipating every bit of force I apply. 
(MORE) 
ARON (CONT'D) All it's good for is sitting in... 
CUT TO: 
REALTIME: 
We see a more objective view of his morning's activities as he describes them. We see him below us as the raven flies between us and him. 
CUT TO: 
VIDEO: 
ARON There's a raven flies overhead, I clocked it at 8.15. I'll bet it's there tomorrow too. I'll film it for you tomorrow 
CUT TO: 
REALTIME: EXT. SKY. DAY. 
We see the raven and we see him check his watch. Sure enough, 8.14 Slides to 8.15. 
CUT TO: 
VIDEO: 
ARON I have about one hundred and fifty millilitres of water left. That's four ounces. I can't believe it but I peed twice today, within a few minutes of each other. How is this possible? It's two days since I peed, I'm dehydrated and I had to go so quickly I forgot to save the first. I saved the second in the CamelBak. Will I drink it? It smells foul, and hot but it'll settle. And I can chill it in the sand in the night. It's like Polar winter here for nine hours. 
CUT TO: 
REALTIME: We see his precious bottle of water. It looks back at him. Next to it is the Camelbak of his stored urine. 
CUT TO: 
VIDEO: 
ARON (CONT'D) (mutters, bitterly) It's cold... this place is an ice- box at night... And killing winds. 
PAUSE 
ARON (CONT'D) (he struggles to complete the sense of the 
SENTENCE) 
" - to do all the outings that I did". PAUSE. As he loses track of what he's saying and then catches up, the canyon has become noticeably darker. He's oblivious. 
ARON (CONT'D) I did want to say, on the logistical side of things, I have some American Express insurance that should cover costs of the recovery operation when that does happen. Bank account balances should take care of my credit-card debts. You'll have to sell my house, Mom and Dad. Possession- wise, I don't know if Sonja can use my computer and video camera... 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. 
He's interrupted by a sudden realization as he looks first one way up the canyon and then the other. He looks up at the sky above. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SLOT CANYON. DAY. ARON'S POV. 
There's an angry looking black motherfucker of a cloud. 
CUT TO: 
HUGE C/U OF: A massive crack of noise like the land has split. His eyes staring up, unblinking, the corridor of light above him reflected in is contact lenses like mirrors. Suddenly a drop of water hits his eye like an invisible bomb dropping from the sky. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT. DAY. 
We're many miles away, the dust spits as though hit by silent bullet tracer fire. Raindrops gathering and multiplying, soaking and bouncing off the desert floor, they skim and slip into a groove and then another, the slit instantly fills and water drops crash on the new surface. The spillage spreads and fills everything near it. We tilt up, the sky is furious black, and murderous. Lightning arcs across hundreds of miles. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. 
Aron's sky darkens above him. Instantly plunging him into a dark, violet nether-light. He looks up the canyon as he pulls at his arm in panic and tries to gather his laid-out possessions into his backpack. Simultaneously he opens his mouth to gather any drops he can into his parched throat. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT. DAY. 
A channel fills now as the grooves spill and multiply. The water poured from above appears everywhere, visibility is virtually gone, whether it's through mist or darkness it's impossible to tell. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DESERT. DAY. 
Another channel explodes like a volcanic surging mass in every direction. The camera literally slips and slides as the water now seems to take a direction towards deeper gulleys, looking for something to fill, for somewhere to escape to. 
The floor of the desert becomes a river careering towards the slot canyons. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. NIGHT. 
He can't believe so little time has passed. He's only just closed his eyes. It's going to be a long night. The two bottles stand looking at him. He goes back in the head bag and we go with him. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT 
He holds the video camera at waist height and switches it to playback. He rewinds through his messages. Stops, switches off playback and rewinds the blue LCD screen to save battery. The light is surreal, soft LCD hell. 
CUT TO: 
HUGE C/U OF: Battery time. Time rewinding, hurtling backwards. 
Stops. Plays back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CATHEDRAL CAVE. DAY. VIDEO FOOTAGE. 
Megan and Kristi. The Cathedral. They clamber out in wet clothes - it's from after their first jumps. We see all three of them climb and fall and get out of the water and climb and fall, smashing into the azure water. Their faces are dripping wet, beaming mad, screaming and howling, completely natural, children really, on their first helter- skelter / Big Dipper. 
He rewinds this time in vision. Kristi's bra and pants are soaking. Megan's top cascades water as she rises out of the water. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT 
For Aron the volume of his and their shouting is deafening and the first human sounds he has heard for days. He watches, staring, laughing; not laughing, staring, eyes tearing in self-pity. 
CUT TO: 
C/U: VIDEO CAMERA 
HE STOPS IT IN VISION There's water, joy, 2 beautiful girls, happiness, sensuality, company, freedom... 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT. 
He looks at the picture and then into the bag. His breathing is hard, pronounced. He carefully tells himself.. 
ARON No. No. Don't. 
He sees the moisture on the inside of the bag, condensation. He licks it with his sticky tongue, twice, three times. He looks back at the LCD screen. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT. 
The LCD looks back at him.

INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT. 
INT. CANYON. NIGHT. 
Aron very still, listens to their screams. He looks at his knife dangling from his wrist by the shoelace. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CANYON. SUNRISE. 
Hundreds of miles of canyon - sunrise. The inner canyons change from dark umbers and black shadows to immense bands of pastel yellow, white, green and a hundred shades of red, a hallucinogenic movement towards light. 
V.O. `Good morning America!' etc. 
There's a chorus of 'Good Mornings' from American TV & radio shows. Literally dozens of them from Texas to Oregon, Massachusetts to the Carolinas. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE: 
" TUESDAY ": 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. MORNING. VIDEO FOOTAGE. 
Aron joins the morning chorus. 
ARON Good morning everyone! It's 6:45 Tuesday morning in BJ Canyon. The weather is great! I figure by now that Leona, my housemate - Hi Leona! - has missed me hopefully since I didn't show up last night. Another hour and a half they'll miss me for not showing up for work. Hi Brion at work! Best case scenario is they notify the police and after a 24 hour hold they file a report, a missing persons report. Which means noon tomorrow it's official that I'm gone. I do still have the tiniest bit of water left. Well, actually, I've resorted...I've had a couple pretty good gulps of urine that I saved in my Camelbak. I sorta let it distill...it tastes like hell. So it's 70 hours since I left on my bike from Horseshoe Trailhead during which time I have consumed 3 liters of water and a couple mouthfuls of piss. 
Pause. Did I say the weather is great? Well, it is. Though flash floods potential is still present. There's 4-prong major canyons upstream from me that all converge in this 3 foot wide gap where I am. The rock I pulled down on top of me, it was put there by flood. 
PAUSE Still, I'd get a drink. He shudders, it's ridiculous. Then composes himself during a long blink and looks straight at the camera. 
ARON (CONT'D) Mom, Dad, I really love you guys. I wanted to take this time to say the times we've spent together have been awesome. I haven't appreciated you in my own heart the way I know I could. Mom, I love you. I wish I'd returned all of your calls, ever. 
(MORE) 
ARON (CONT'D) I really have lived this last year. I wish I had learned some lessons more astutely, more rapidly, than I did. I love you. I'll always be with you. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. MORNING. 
Switches off the camera. He charges into setting up the 6:1 haul system again. Much quicker this time. He clears the rope - the rock - of his possessions and puts his sunglasses on. 
ARON Ready for lift-off. He bounces his full weight in the stirrups and pulls on the haul line. It looks a better set up. 
ARON (CONT'D) Come on, move, dammit. 
Nothing. He stops. And stares directly at the knife below him. Absolute stillness. Nothing moves. Not him. Not even the insects. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. MORNING. 
The knife stares back. 
TITLE: 
" NIGHT FOUR. WEDNESDAY. NIGHT FIVE " 
CUT TO: 
INT/EXT. VARIOUS. 
The rest of Tuesday and night, and Wednesday and night play out through the triptych. Repetition is used to create a trippy sense of losing coherence- sometimes there's 3 Arons doing the same thing. It could be consecutive days or he's forgotten. 
At key moments it resolves to one image and then back again. Things seem to loop and his close-ups almost seem to watch the loops happening again and again. This is particularly true inside the head bag at night. When his light is switched on it's bleached and monstrously overlit, like cruel HD close- up - his disintegration is terrifying. 
When it's off we establish a night vision, of green, of blue, that allows us to witness him in hiding. The images, sometimes of himself also, play out on the interior surface of the bag. The effect is like wraparound Imax, multi-screen Technicolor. 
INT. CANYON. DAY. DIPTYCH.

It's tough looking at him. So long without water. The dehydration is frightening. 
ARON No raven today. Everything's fucked. Sonja... if you still want me to play at your wedding... there's a tape in a box in the basement of Mom and Dad's Lounge. It's me 1993 or 1994. We hear the music. Mozart, Beethoven, Bach, Chopin - he can hear it as he played it until... 
ARON (CONT'D) There was a little boy,and he looked like my cousin Charlie but he was too young. And I don't want to die... But I really don't know what to do. Pause. 
Quietly, deadly: 
VOICE I did this Aron. I created this. The boulder did what it was here to do. It was waiting for me but it did the only natural thing it could do. I chose to come here, I chose to do this descent by myself. I chose not to tell anyone where I was going. I chose to turn away from the women who were there to keep me from getting in this trouble. I wanted it to be like this. Look how far I came to find this spot. 
It's not that I'm getting what I deserve - I'm getting what I wanted. He's empty now. He clicks the camera shut and puts it away. That's over. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. 
He looks at his 'good' hand. It's swollen and angry red like an inflated prosthetic on top and around of his real hand. He takes off his shoe and pulls the sock over his hand to cushion his palm and picks up the black rounded hammer rock again. Ignoring the pain he starts hammering at the rock surface. SMASH. MAD NOW. 
ARON I hate this rock. The rage blooms purple in his mind. 
ARON (CONT'D) I hate it. His face swells with anger, nostrils flaring. 
ARON (CONT'D) I hate this fucking canyon. 
A small mushroom cloud of pulverized grit and dust erupts each time. 
ARON (CONT'D) I hate this cold slab pressing me against this damp fucking wall. Smash, Smash, Smash. 
ARON (CONT'D) I know there's water near coz of these fucking mosquitoes. 
The sock quickly disintegrates with friction as he hammers and hammers. 
ARON (CONT'D) I hate this fucking mess. 
Finally he stops but his fingers are paralyzed, fused rigid around the rock. He pulls them off with his teeth and the stone drops to his feet. 
He returns to the knife. Finally all that remains inside is a pale white strand. Like swollen angel hair pasta. The nerve. He touches it with the knife edge. 
ARON 
AAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH! 
He explodes internally with vocal pain, through gritted teeth. The first time he has made any sound during the surgery. But it's like he's been taser-ed, he's stunned still for a minute

He looks at it... the nerve. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. 
...and the thin, swollen wire of his own nerve looks back at him. For the final time, he asks himself, `Can you do this?' 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. 
He puts the knife in and pulls it toward him, an inch, two inches, it lengthens like pulling a guitar string. Unimaginable pain builds in his whole body, like he's pushing his arm into a cauldron of magma... 
(It's difficult to tell because everything is so tight and claustrophobic but maybe the boy is there intermittently riding his shoulders slipping across and around him, or obstructed by the boulder and stopped from getting to Aron) ...until it breaks. He shudders in shock and drops everything for minutes. His head lolls forward dripping. His mind swarming with trauma. And then he's back on the last action stretching the skin of his outer wrist tight and sawing the blade into the wall. It's a piece of gristle on a cutting board. Everything now is forcing us towards the boulder, cramping us in with him impossibly close, he's sweating and heaving, his vision blurring with tears, his contacts failing, his breath impossibly dry and rasping and then, as simply as this all began, his shoulders open and he's free...... He staggers back, one, two, three steps away from his arm... 
His head swarming with colours, swooning, overpowering. He stares at his obituary as he's born again. His feet stagger under him like a new foal, an involuntary dance, we see colours bleeding and blending in his P.O.V.s and the colours invade our shots of him. 
ARON (spitting out this declaration at the rock)

He's busy packaging his stump in the plastic grocery sack and then wrapping that with the yellow webbing he wore as a chocker to keep his neck warm in the night. He stuffs the repackaged arm into the empty Camelbak backpack and throws the straps over his neck to hold the arm in a makeshift sling. Packs his bag, water reservoir, full bottle of shiny urine, video, pocket knife. Grabs his climbing rope, messy and knotted from its use as insulation, and heads off down the canyon. 
Stops almost immediately and hesitates for a beat. He returns 
to take 2 photos on his still camera of the rock and his hand. Goodbye.

70 yards ahead, 3 aliens are walking away from him. 2 tall, one shorter. All with elongated bodies and tiny heads, shimmering in the heat. 
He goes to shout but his voice catches. Then a feeble effort is lost in the vast scale of the canyon. The figures walk on bending and disappearing in the light. He digs deep. 
ARON 
HELP! 
And the figures turn. There's a terrible pause of uncertainty on both sides and then he pushes out another heartbreaking - 
ARON (CONT'D) 
HELP ME! I NEED HELP! The figures begin to run towards him. We watch his face in close up as they come. If tears come, then now they come at the sight of humans. He mutters to himself. 
ARON (CONT'D) Hang in there Aron. At they get closer he summons a surge of energy from somewhere. 
ARON (CONT'D) My name is Aron Ralston. I was trapped by a boulder on Saturday and I've been without food and water for 5 days. I cut my arm off this morning to get free and I've lost a lot of blood. I need medical attention. 
There's a pause as they look at this refugee from a low budget horror movie. He hungrily eyes the water bottles attached to their waist bands. This gives them a way in to his world. The moment is broken by their offering him their water. It pours down his throat bypassing the swallow mechanism.

INT. TV STUDIO. DAY. ERIK MEJER TESTIMONY 
(Erik's English is almost perfect, although accented and without humour. His family sit beside him on comfortable chairs in a TV studio. They are very pleased to 
BE THERE) 
ERIK We are the Mejers from Holland. At the start of the trailhead we talked to a ranger who told us about a car that was parked in the area already for several days and that the owner might be missing in the canyon. We joked that we would keep our eyes open and that we would try to find him. After a hike of 5.3 kilometres to the Great Gallery (Indian rock art) where we took some pictures, we returned and suddenly heard a noise behind us, and after that a voice that cried "Help, I need help". Monique and I immediately realized that this had to be the missing person.

ERIK (CONT'D) We didn't find him, he found us! We gave him our water and Oreos.

Back now live as Aron wolfs down the cookies and organises the Mejers in a series of jump cuts pushing us through the final stages-he's brutally practical. 
ERIK We are the Mejers from Holland. You should stop and rest. 
ARON No, we need to keep hiking. We need a helicopter - who can run fastest?- You, go now fast. Take him. 
Monique runs ahead with Andy, her son. 
ERIK They told us you were here. 
ARON Who? Who told you? 
ERIK The police at the parking lot 
BURLY MAN That's all your miracle days used up kid. You need to rest. You can stand everyone a beer later. Aron is greeted by medics. Needles. Care. Machines. Tubes.

He opens his fist and there is the small folded up knife.

A very soft voice reading.

ARON Mom. 
MOM My boy. My only one. There you are. She strokes his head so gently. 
ARON Hey Mom. 
MOM How are you feeling? 
ARON OK. Are you okay... 
MOM You've been asleep for 2 days. We are so lucky... She's a decent woman and a devoted mum. She looks weary, worn out with worry and love for her boy. 
ARON Mom, I'm sorry I scared you. 
Very soft voice (again) - Aron hears the same words as he drifts back into drugged rest. 
VOICE (MOM) ...his love, the peace that passeth all understanding...

Flash of celebrity. His first press conference. And boy, is there a lot of press there! 
Aron, of course has his camera with him as he walks out and takes a snap of the noise and light. We see his still, it's floor to ceiling, wall to wall journalists.

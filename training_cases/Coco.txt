EXT. MARIGOLD PATH - DUSK 
A path of marigold petals leads up to an altar lovingly arranged in a humble cemetery. An old woman lights a candle as the smoke of burning copal wood dances lyrically upward...

CARD: A PIXAR ANIMATION STUDIOS FILM 
The smoke lifts up toward lines of papel picado ­- cut paper banners -- that sway gently in the breeze. 
PAPEL PICADO CARD: "COCO" 
MIGUEL (V.O.) Sometimes I think I'm cursed... 'cause of something that happened before I was even born. 
A story begins to play out on the papel picado. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) See, a long time ago there was this family. 
The images on the papel picado come to life to illustrate a father, a mother, and a little girl. The family is happy. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) The papá, he was a musician. 
The papá plays guitar while the mother dances with her daughter. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) He and his family would sing, and dance, and count their blessings... (beat) But he also had a dream... to play for the world. (beat) And one day he left with his guitar... and never returned. 
The man walks down a road, guitar slung on his back. In another vignette his daughter stands in the doorway, watching her papá leave. Two feet step up next to her. It is her mamá, hardened. 
She shuts the door. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) And the mamá...? She didn't have time to cry over that walkaway musician! (beat) After banishing all music from her life... 
The woman gets rid of all of her husband's instruments and records. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) She found a way to provide for her daughter... (beat) She rolled up her sleeves and she learned to make shoes. (beat) She could have made candy! 
Amongst the papel picado, a stick swings at a strung up piñata which bursts with candy... 
MIGUEL (V.O.) Or fireworks! 
Fireworks go off in the background... 
MIGUEL (V.O.) Or sparkly underwear for wrestlers! 
Sparkly underwear and a luchador mask hang on a line amongst other linens... 
MIGUEL (V.O.) But no... she chose shoes... 
On the papel picado, the little girl becomes a young woman. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) Then she taught her daughter to make shoes. And later, she taught her son-in-law. 
She introduces a suitor to the family business. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) Then her grandkids got roped in. As her family grew, so did the business. 
In the next vignette, a bunch of goofy grandchildren join in the shoemaking. The shoe shop is full of family! 
MIGUEL (V.O.) Music had torn her family apart, but shoes held them all together. (beat) You see, that woman was my great- great grandmother, Mamá Imelda. 
TILT DOWN from the papel picado to the 
OFRENDA ROOM - DAY 
where a photo sits at the top of a beautiful altar. The photo features MAMÁ IMELDA -- serious, formidable. She holds a baby on her lap. Her husband stands beside her, but his face has been torn away. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) She died WAY before I was born. But my family still tells her story every year on Día de los Muertos -- the Day of the Dead... (beat) And her little girl? 
Fade from the face of the little girl to present day MAMÁ COCO (97), a living raisin, convalescing in a wicker wheelchair. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) She's my great grandmother, Mamá Coco. 
A boy (12) walks into frame and kisses her on the cheek. This is our narrator, MIGUEL. 
MIGUEL Holá, Mamá Coco. 
MAMÁ COCO How are you, Julio? 
MIGUEL (V.O.) Actually, my name is Miguel. Mamá Coco has trouble remembering things... But it's good to talk to her anyway. So I tell her pretty much everything. 
QUICK CUTS of Miguel with Mamá Coco: 
EXT. COURTYARD 
MIGUEL I used to run like this... 
Miguel pumps his arms with his hands in fists.           Then he switches to flat palms. 
Running past a food stand, Miguel grabs a roll of pan dulce and tosses the vendor a coin. 
MIGUEL Muchas gracias! 
STREET VENDOR De nada, Miguel! 
As Miguel passes all these scenes, the music synthesizes and he can't help but tap out rhythms along a table of alebrijes. The fantastical wooden animal sculptures each play a different tone like a marimba. Miguel finishes with a SMACK on a trash can, out of which a pops up a scrappy hairless Xolo dog. The dog, DANTE, barks and jumps up to lick Miguel, who laughs. 
MIGUEL Hey, hey!    Dante! 
Miguel holds the pan dulce over Dante's head. 
MIGUEL Sit. Down. Roll over.        Shake. Fist bump. 
Dante obeys to the best of his ability. 
MIGUEL Good boy, Dante! 
Miguel tosses the pan dulce to his furless friend who topples back into the trash can. 
CUT TO: 
MARIACHI PLAZA - MOMENTS LATER 
Miguel rounds the corner toward the town square. Vendors sell sugar skulls and marigolds, and musicians fill the square with music. 
MIGUEL (V.O) I know I'm not supposed to love music -- but it's not my fault! (beat) It's his: Ernesto de la Cruz... 
Miguel approaches a statue of a handsome mariachi at the heart of the plaza. 
MIGUEL (V.O) ...The greatest musician of all time. 
A tour group and their TOUR GUIDE are gathered around the base of the statue. 
TOUR GUIDE And right here, in this very plaza, the young Ernesto de la Cruz took his first steps toward becoming the most beloved singer in Mexican history! 
CUT TO: 
CLIPS of de la Cruz in his hay day: playing as a young man in the plaza, serenading bystanders in a train car... 
MIGUEL (V.O.) He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me. But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him. 
MORE CLIPS from de la Cruz's films. He leaps from a tree branch onto a galloping horse. He plays his signature skull guitar with flourish and flair. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) He starred in movies. He had the coolest guitar... He could fly! 
A CLIP features de la Cruz dressed as a hovering priest, held up by strings, in front of a cycling sky flat. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) And he wrote the best songs! But my all-time favorite? It's-- 
A CLIP of de la Cruz performing in a fancy nightclub. 
DE LA CRUZ (singing) REMEMBER ME THOUGH I HAVE TO SAY GOODBYE REMEMBER ME DON'T LET IT MAKE YOU CRY FOR EVEN IF I'M FAR AWAY I HOLD YOU IN MY HEART I SING A SECRET SONG TO YOU EACH NIGHT WE ARE APART REMEMBER ME (MORE) 
DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D) THOUGH I HAVE TO TRAVEL FAR REMEMBER ME EACH TIME YOU HEAR A SAD GUITAR KNOW THAT I'M WITH YOU THE ONLY WAY THAT I CAN BE... 
MIGUEL (V.O.) He lived the kind of life you dream about... Until 1942... 
As the audience swoons over de la Cruz, an absent-minded stagehand leans on a lever. Ropes and pulleys go flying. 
DE LA CRUZ UNTIL YOU'RE IN MY ARMS AGAIN REMEMBER ME! 
De la Cruz is subsequently crushed by a giant bell. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) When he was crushed by a giant bell. 
CUT TO: 
MARIACHI PLAZA - DAY 
Miguel gazes up at the statue of de la Cruz in awe. 
MIGUEL (V.O) I wanna be just like him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER 
Miguel weaves up to de la Cruz's mausoleum and peeks in the window. He catches a glimpse of de la Cruz's signature skull guitar. 
MIGUEL (V.O.) Sometimes, I look at de la Cruz and I get this feeling... like we're connected somehow. Like, if HE could play music, maybe someday I could too... 
EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - DAY 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) ...If it wasn't for my family. 
PLAZA MARIACHI (playful) Ay, ay, ay, muchacho. 
MIGUEL Huh? 
PLAZA MARIACHI I asked for a shoe shine, not your life story. 
Miguel comes out of his reverie and looks up at the PLAZA MARIACHI whose shoes he is shining. 
MIGUEL Oh, yeah, sorry. 
He goes back to scrubbing the man's shoe.    As Miguel shines, the mariachi plucks his guitar idly. 
INT. RIVERA WORKSHOP 
The Rivera workshop is abuzz with family making shoes. WHOMP! Miguel is plopped onto a stool, ready for a lecture. 
ABUELITA I found your son in Mariachi Plaza! 
PAPÁ (disappointed) Miguel... 
MAMÁ You know how Abuelita feels about the plaza. 
MIGUEL I was just shining shoes! 
TÍO BERTO A musician's shoes! 
Gasps from the family. PRIMO ABEL (19) is so shocked he loses his grip on the shoe he is polishing, which zips away from the polisher and lodges itself in the roof. 
MIGUEL But the plaza's where all the foot traffic is. 
PAPÁ If Abuelita says no more plaza, then no more plaza. 
MIGUEL (blurting) But what about tonight? 
PAPÁ FRANCO What's tonight? 
MIGUEL Well they're having this talent show- 
Abuelita perks her ear, suspicious.          Miguel squirms, deciding whether to go on. 
MIGUEL And I thought I might... 
Mamá looks at Miguel, curious. 
MAMÁ ...Sign up? 
MIGUEL Well, maybe? 
PRIMA ROSA (laughing) You have to have talent to be in a talent show. 
PRIMO ABEL What are YOU going to do, shine shoes? 
The shoe from the ceiling falls back down on Abel's head. 
ABUELITA It's Día de los Muertos -- no one's going anywhere. Tonight is about family. 
She deposits a pile of marigolds in Miguel's arms. 
ABUELITA Ofrenda room. Vámonos. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OFRENDA ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Miguel follows his Abuelita to the family ofrenda, holding the pile of flowers as she arranges them on the altar. 
ABUELITA Don't give me that look. Día de los Muertos is the one night of the year our ancestors can come visit us. (beat) We've put their photos on the ofrenda so their spirits can cross over. That is very important! If we don't put them up, they can't come! (beat) We made all this food -- set out the things they loved in life, mijo. All this work to bring the family together. I don't want you sneaking off to who-knows-where. 
She looks up to find Miguel sneaking away. 
ABUELITA (CONT'D) Where are you going? 
MIGUEL I thought we were done... 
ABUELITA Ay, Dios mío... Being part of this family means being HERE for this family... I don't want to see you end up like-- 
Abuelita looks up to the photo of the faceless musician. 
MIGUEL Like Mamá Coco's papá? 
ABUELITA Never mention that man!      He's better off forgotten. 
MIGUEL But you're the one who-- 
ABUELITA Ta, ta, ta-tch! 
MIGUEL I was just-- 
ABUELITA Tch-tch! 
MIGUEL But-- 
ABUELITA Tch! 
MIGUEL I-- 
ABUELITA Tch-tch! 
MAMÁ COCO Papá? 
They look to find Mamá Coco agitated. 
MAMÁ COCO (CONT'D) Papá is home...? 
ABUELITA Mamá, cálmese, cálmese. 
MAMÁ COCO Papá is coming home? 
ABUELITA No Mamá.   It's okay, I'm here. 
The tape ends with an interview clip. 
INTERVIEWER (FILM CLIP) Señor de la Cruz, what did it take for you to seize your moment? 
DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) I had to have faith in my dream. No one was going to hand it to me. It was up to me to reach for that dream, grab it tight, and make it come true. 
MIGUEL ...and make it come true. 
The tape ends. The words sink into Miguel.        He reaches for the flyer for the plaza "TALENT SHOW." 
MIGUEL No more hiding, Dante.      I gotta seize my moment! 
Dante wags his tail, panting happily. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) I'm gonna play in Mariachi Plaza if it kills me! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RIVERA COMPOUND - SUNSET 
Children run by with sparklers as Abuelita opens the doors to the family compound. 
ABUELITA Día de los Muertos has begun! 
In the courtyard, two TODDLER COUSINS haphazardly scatter marigold petals from their baskets. 
MAMÁ No, no, no, no, no. 
Mamá corrects them, creating a path from the ofrenda room to the front gate. 
MAMÁ (CONT'D) We have to make a clear path. The petals guide our ancestors home. We don't want their spirits to get lost. We want them to come, and enjoy all the food and drinks on the ofrenda, sí? 
As Mamá teaches, Miguel and Dante sneak across the roof and drop to the sidewalk outside the compound, Miguel clutching his guitar. 
Suddenly Tío Berto and Papá round the corner carrying a small table from storage. 
PAPÁ Mamá, where should we put this table? 
Miguel and Dante back up to avoid the adults, only to find Abuelita sweeping the sidewalk behind them! Miguel and Dante jump into the back into the Rivera courtyard before she sees them. 
ABUELITA In the courtyard, mijos. 
PAPÁ You want it down by the kitchen? 
ABUELITA Sí.   Next to the other one. 
INT. OFRENDA ROOM 
Miguel backs out of the courtyard and into the family ofrenda room. Nearly cornered, he ushers Dante past a sleeping Mamá Coco. He stashes the dog and the guitar under the ofrenda table. 
MIGUEL Get under, get under! 
ABUELITA (O.S.) Miguel! 
Miguel straightens up to notice the doorway of the ofrenda room darkened by three figures. 
MIGUEL Nothing! 
His Abuelita and parents stare straight at him.     A pit grows in his stomach; he's been caught. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) Mamá -- Papá, I-- 
Papá lifts his finger to silence his son. 
PAPÁ Miguel... (beat) Your Abuelita had the most wonderful idea! (beat) We've all decided -- it's time you joined us in the workshop! 
Abuelita hands Papá a leather apron, which he hangs over Miguel's shoulders. 
MIGUEL What?! 
PAPÁ No more shining shoes -- you will be making them! Every day after school! 
Abuelita shuffles toward Miguel squealing.      She squeezes his cheeks, full of pride. 
ABUELITA Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-to carrying on the family tradition! And on Día de los Muertos! Your ancestors will be so proud! 
She gestures to the shoes adorning the ofrenda. 
ABUELITA (CONT'D) You'll craft huaraches just like your Tía Victoria. 
PAPÁ And wingtips, like your Papá Julio-- 
Miguel crosses away from the ofrenda. 
MIGUEL But what if I'm no good at making shoes? 
PAPÁ Ah, Migue... You have your family here to guide you... (beat) You are a Rivera. And a Rivera is...? 
MIGUEL ...A shoemaker. Through and through. 
Papá swells. 
PAPÁ That's my boy! (calling out) Berto, break out the good stuff, I wanna make a toast! 
Papá heads out of the room, Mamá follows. Last is Abuelita, who smothers Miguel with tons of kisses as she leaves. 
With the family gone, Miguel deflates. 
Abuelita smashes it to bits! 
ABUELITA There. No guitar, no music. (softening) (MORE) 
ABUELITA (CONT'D) Come. You'll feel better after you eat with your family. 
She reaches out to comfort Miguel, but he is hurt beyond repair. 
MIGUEL I don't wanna be in this family! 
He snatches the photo from Papá and bolts out of the hacienda. 
PAPÁ Miguel!   MIGUEL! 
EXT. SIDE STREET 
Miguel bursts out of the compound, desperate to get away. Dante, nose buried in a trash bag, hears Miguel and chases after him. Miguel runs past a poster for the plaza "TALENT SHOW." 
EXT. MARIACHI PLAZA - EVENING 
Miguel approaches a STAGE MANAGER in the gazebo. 
MIGUEL I wanna play in the plaza. Like de la Cruz! Can I still sign-up? 
STAGE MANAGER You got an instrument? 
MIGUEL No... But if I can borrow a guitar-- 
STAGE MANAGER Musicians gotta bring their own instruments... (walking away) You find a guitar, kid, I'll put you on the list. 
Miguel looks distraught. 
MOMENTS LATER: 
Miguel approaches any musician he can find. 
MIGUEL Excuse me, can I borrow your guitar? 
MUSICIAN #1 Sorry, muchacho. 
CUT TO: 
MIGUEL You guys have a spare guitar? 
MUSICIAN #2 No. 
CUT TO: 
MIGUEL I need a guitar, just for a little bit-- 
MUSICIAN #3 Get outta here, kid! 
Disheartened, Miguel walks away.       He finds himself facing the statue of de la Cruz. 
MIGUEL Great-great grandfather... What am I supposed to do? 
No answer. Miguel's gaze falls on a plaque at the base of the statue that reads "Seize Your Moment!" Miguel looks at the photo in his hand. He moves his thumb to reveal the skull head guitar. Then, a firework illuminates the skull head guitar that the statue holds. Miguel gets an idea. 
EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER 
A sea of candles and flowers, families gathered at graves. 
Miguel sneaks through the cemetery unnoticed, slipping from one shadow to the next. 
Dante suddenly catches up to Miguel.         He barks excitedly. 
MIGUEL No, no, no, no, no, Dante stop! Cállate! Shhh! 
Miguel swipes a chicken leg off a neighboring grave, and chucks it. Dante bounds after the food. 
EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM 
Miguel slinks around the side of the tomb.   He looks in one of the windows. 
Inside, the famous guitar hangs above the crypt. Fireworks pop; bursts of light glint off the instrument. It seems to beckon him. He tries the window but it's locked. 
More fireworks shoot into the sky. 
MIGUEL I'm sorry... 
Timing to the explosions, Miguel throws his shoulder into the rusted-shut window pane and forces it open with a scraping KRRRR-LANK! He slinks inside the tomb. 
INT. DE LA CRUZ'S MAUSOLEUM 
Miguel drops down to the mausoleum floor. The noise from outside is muffled. He climbs onto the crypt, slightly moving the lid. He stifles a gasp. 
He crawls over the marble sarcophagus and comes face-to-face with the famed guitar. Miguel wipes away a layer of dust, revealing the rich painted wood beneath. He looks up to the portrait of de la Cruz. 
MIGUEL Señor de la Cruz? Please don't be mad. I'm Miguel, your great-great grandson... I need to borrow this. 
Heart in his throat, Miguel lifts the guitar off its mount. Unbeknownst to him, some marigold petals in the mausoleum begin to sparkle. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) Our family thinks music is a curse. None of them understand, but I know you would have. You would've told me to follow my heart. To seize my moment! 
He backs up, in full view of the painting. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) So if it's all right with you, I'm gonna play in the plaza, just like you did! 
PAPÁ JULIO (CONT'D) And you can see us?! 
TÍA ROSITA charges through Papá Julio, sending his bones scattering again. She grabs Miguel, hugging him tight. 
TÍA ROSITA Our Migueli-ti-ti-ti-ti-to! 
Miguel, smothered by Rosita's ample ribcage, struggles for air. 
MIGUEL (muffled) Remind me how I know you? 
TÍA ROSITA We're your family, mijo! 
Tía Rosita's ofrenda photo flashes in Miguel's memory. 
MIGUEL Tía... Rosita? 
TÍA ROSITA Sí! 
He looks at Papá Julio, whose head is still turned the wrong way. TÍA VICTORIA straightens it. 
MIGUEL Papá Julio? 
PAPÁ JULIO Hola. 
MIGUEL Tía Victoria? 
Tía Victoria pokes Miguel's cheek, skeptical. 
TÍA VICTORIA He doesn't seem entirely dead. 
A living person ambles through Miguel's non-corporeal form. 
TÍA ROSITA He's not quite alive either... 
PAPÁ JULIO We need Mamá Imelda. She'll know how to fix this! 
Suddenly twin skeleton gents run, huffing, toward the family. 
TÍO FELIPE (huffing) Oye! 
TÍO OSCAR (winded) It's Mamá Imelda-- 
TÍO FELIPE (huffing) --She couldn't cross over! 
The others gasp. 
TÍO OSCAR She's stuck-- 
TÍO FELIPE --On the other side! 
Miguel sees pictures of his Tío Oscar and Tío Felipe flash in his memory. 
MIGUEL Tío Oscar?     Tío Felipe? 
TÍO OSCAR Oh, hey Miguel. 
Tía Victoria turns her gaze on Miguel. 
TÍA VICTORIA I have a feeling this has something to do with you. 
TÍA ROSITA But if Mamá Imelda can't come to us... 
PAPÁ JULIO ...Then we are going to her! Vámonos! 
Papá Julio grabs Miguel by the arm and the family rushes through the cemetery, trailed by Dante. 
EXT. CEMETERY - MOMENTS LATER 
Miguel and his family weave through the graves, rounding a corner. 
His gaze falls upon a glowing MARIGOLD BRIDGE arching before them. 
MIGUEL Whoa... 
The bridge extends into the mist.        A stream of skeletons amble across for the holiday. 
The family passes through an invisible barrier onto the bridge. Their bodies change from ghostly to solid. Miguel hesitates at the threshold. 
PAPÁ JULIO Come on, Miguel. It's ok. 
Miguel follows after the family, the petals glowing under his feet. Dante takes off. 
MIGUEL Dante!   Dante! Dante, wait up! 
Miguel runs after Dante, finally catching up to the dog as he rolls in the petals at the crest of the bridge. He sneezes some petals into Miguel's face. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) You gotta stay with me, boy.       We don't know... where... 
Out of the mist, the sparkling cityscape of the Land of the Dead emerges. It's breathtaking. His family sidles up. 
MIGUEL This isn't a dream, then.        You're all really out there... 
TÍA VICTORIA You thought we weren't? 
MIGUEL Well I don't know, I thought it might've been one of those made up things that adults tell kids... like... vitamins. 
TÍA VICTORIA Miguel, vitamins are a real thing. 
ARRIVALS AGENT Welcome back, amigos! Anything to declare? 
PAPÁ JULIO As a matter of fact, yes. 
The family pushes Miguel to the front, very much alive. 
MIGUEL Hola. 
The arrivals agent's jaw literally drops. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARIGOLD GRAND CENTRAL STATION 
Miguel and his family are escorted by a security guard across an arching second floor walkway. 
VOICE OVER P.A. Paging Marta Gonzales-Ramos. Marta Gonzales-Ramos, please report to Level 7. 
Dante happily trots alongside.       Miguel looks up to see gondolas traveling by. 
MIGUEL Whoa... 
Skeletons stare at Miguel as he walks by. Suddenly Miguel notices Tío Oscar staring at his face in deep contemplation. 
TÍO OSCAR I miss my nose... 
At the end of the walkway are doors emblazoned with "DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS." The family passes through. 
INT. DEPARTMENT OF FAMILY REUNIONS 
Inside, they find case workers helping travelers work out holiday snafus. 
DISTRESSED TRAVELER C'mon! Help us out amigo... We gotta get to a dozen ofrendas tonight... 
CUT TO: 
MIFFED WIFE We are NOT visiting your ex-wife's family for Día de Muertos! 
CUT TO: 
In a far corner, one traveler in particular is raising hell. 
MAMÁ IMELDA I demand to speak to the person in charge! 
A beleaguered CASE WORKER cringes as Mamá Imelda tears into her. 
CASE WORKER I'm sorry, señora, it says here no one put up your photo-- 
Mamá Imelda coldly eyes the Macintosh 128k on the woman's desk. 
MAMÁ IMELDA My family always -- ALWAYS -- puts my photo on the ofrenda! That devil box tells you nothing but lies! 
In a swift movement, Mamá Imelda removes her shoe and smacks the computer. 
PAPÁ JULIO Mamá Imelda? 
She turns her shoe on Papá Julio, who leans back and yelps. Mamá Imelda softens. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Oh, mi familia! They wouldn't let me cross the bridge! Tell this woman and her devil box that my photo is on the ofrenda. 
PAPÁ JULIO Well, we never made it to the ofrenda... 
MAMÁ IMELDA What?! 
PAPÁ JULIO We ran into... um... 
Mamá Imelda's eyes fall on Miguel. 
Miguel looks at Mamá Imelda.       Her photo flashes before him. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Miguel? 
MIGUEL Mamá Imelda... 
MAMÁ IMELDA What is going on? 
Just then, a door opens and a CLERK pokes his head out. 
CLERK You the Rivera family? 
The computer short circuits. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CLERK'S OFFICE 
CLERK Well, you're cursed. 
The family gasps. 
MIGUEL What?! 
The clerk searches through a huge stack of papers. 
CLERK Día de los Muertos is a night to GIVE to the dead. You STOLE from the dead. 
MIGUEL But I wasn't stealing the guitar! 
Miguel and Dante burst out the door and rush down the stairs. Héctor's arm snaps to get Miguel's attention. Miguel realizes it's no longer attached to Héctor's body. The arm signals backwards to Héctor who is ten paces behind. 
HÉCTOR Espérame chamaco! 
Miguel throws the arm back to Héctor an they disappear into a dense crowd. 
Moments later, the Dead Riveras burst from the revolving doors. Mamá Imelda scours the crowd for Miguel. He's nowhere to be found. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Ay, he is going to get himself killed... I need my spirit guide, Pepita. 
Mamá Imelda looks to the night sky, puts two fingers to her mouth, and lets out a piercing whistle. 
FWOOOMP! A giant winged jaguar lands in front of Mamá Imelda. She turns to the family. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Who has that petal Miguel touched? 
PAPÁ JULIO Here! 
Papá Julio steps forward with a marigold petal.      He creeps forward, jittery, holding it out for Pepita. 
PAPÁ JULIO Nice alebrije... 
Pepita sniffs the petal's scent. 
Suddenly Pepita's head darts, narrowing in on the scent.         She takes to the air. 
EXT. UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Miguel sits on a wooden crate. Héctor uses his thumb to smudge black and white shoe polish on the boy's face. 
HÉCTOR Hey, hey, hold still. (beat) Look up. Look up. A ver, a ver... look up. Up, UP!... Ta-da! 
Héctor opens a small mirror.       Miguel's face is painted to look like a skeleton. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) Dead as a doorknob. (beat) So listen, Miguel: this place runs on memories. When you're well- remembered, people put up your photo and you get to cross the bridge and visit the living on Día de Muertos. (beat) Unless you're me. 
MIGUEL You don't get to cross over. 
HÉCTOR No one's ever put up my picture... (beat) But you can change that! 
He unfolds an old picture.        In it is a young, living Héctor. 
MIGUEL This is you? 
HÉCTOR Muy guapo, eh? 
MIGUEL So you get me to my great-great grandpa, then I put up your photo when I get home? 
HÉCTOR Such a smart boy! Yes! Great idea, yes! (beat) One hiccup: de la Cruz is a tough guy to get to. And I need to cross that bridge soon. Like TONIGHT. (upbeat) So, you got any other family here, you know? Someone a bit more... accessible? 
MIGUEL Mmm, nope. 
HÉCTOR Don't yank my chain, chamaco.      You gotta have SOME other family. 
MIGUEL ONLY de la Cruz. If you can't help me, I'll find him myself. 
Miguel marches out of the alley, whistling for Dante to follow. 
HÉCTOR Okay, okay, kid, fine -- fine! I'll get you to your great-great grandpa...! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BUSTLING STREET 
They make their way through a pedestrian path. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) ...It's not gonna be easy, you know? He's a busy man. (beat) What are you doing? 
Miguel slink-walks next to Héctor goofily. 
MIGUEL I'm walking like a skeleton. Blending in. 
HÉCTOR No, skeletons don't walk like that. 
MIGUEL It's how you walk. 
HÉCTOR No, I don't. 
Miguel keeps walking funny. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) Stop it! 
Miguel notices a billboard advertising "ERNESTO DE LA CRUZ'S SUNRISE SPECTACULAR!;" "Remember Me" blares from attached speakers. 
MIGUEL Whoa..."Ernesto de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular...!" Qué padre! 
HÉCTOR Blech. Every year, your great- great grandpa puts on that dumb show to mark the end of Día de Muertos. 
MIGUEL And you can get us in! 
HÉCTOR Ahhhh-- 
MIGUEL Hey, you said you had front row tickets! 
HÉCTOR That... that was a lie.      I apologize for that. 
Miguel gives Héctor a withering look. 
Miguel brightens.     Frida turns back to the rehearsal. 
FRIDA The dancers exit, the music fades, the lights go out! And Ernesto de la Cruz rises to the stage! 
A silhouette rises from a trap door.         Miguel leans forward. 
A spotlight shines on the silhouette revealing it to be a mannequin. 
MIGUEL Huh? 
FRIDA He does a couple of songs, the sun rises, everyone cheers-- 
Miguel hustles up to Frida. 
MIGUEL Excuse me, where's the real de la Cruz? 
FRIDA Ernesto doesn't do rehearsals. He's too busy hosting that fancy party at the top of his tower. 
She gestures out a large window to a GRAND ESTATE lit up in the distance, atop a steep hill. 
Suddenly Héctor rounds the corner, out of breath. 
HÉCTOR Chamaco! You can't run off on me like that! C'mon, stop pestering the celebrities... 
Héctor pulls Miguel away, but Miguel won't be wrangled. 
MIGUEL You said my great-great grandpa would be here! He's halfway across town, throwing some big party. 
HÉCTOR That bum! Who doesn't show up to his own rehearsal? 
MIGUEL If you're such good friends, how come he didn't invite you? 
HÉCTOR He's YOUR great-great grandpa.   How come he didn't invite YOU? 
Héctor walks away from Miguel toward the musicians. 
HÉCTOR Hey Gustavo! You know anything about this party? 
GUSTAVO It's the hot ticket. But if you're not on the guest list you're never getting in, Chorizo... 
MUSICIANS Hey, it's Chorizo! / Choricito! 
HÉCTOR Ha ha, very funny guys.      Very funny. 
MIGUEL Chorizo? 
GUSTAVO (to Miguel, re: Héctor) Oh, this guy's famous! Go on, go on, ask him how he died! 
Miguel looks to Héctor, eyebrow cocked. 
HÉCTOR I don't want to talk about it. 
GUSTAVO He choked on some CHORIZO! 
The musicians laugh.     Miguel tries to stifle a giggle. 
HÉCTOR I didn't choke, okay -- I got food poisoning, which is a big difference! 
More laughter. 
HÉCTOR (to Miguel) This is why I don't like musicians... bunch of self- important jerks! 
MIGUEL Hey, I'm a musician. 
HÉCTOR You are? 
GUSTAVO Well, if you really want to get to Ernesto, there IS that music competition at the Plaza de la Cruz. Winner gets to play at his party... 
Miguel's wheels start turning. 
HÉCTOR No, no, no, chamaco, you are loco if you think-- 
Miguel looks to his hands, progressed in their skeletal transformation. 
MIGUEL I need to get my great-great grandfather's blessing. 
Miguel looks up to Héctor. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) You know where I can get a guitar? 
Héctor sighs. 
HÉCTOR I know a guy... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT 
Pepita sweeps across the sky, landing in a darkened corner. She casts a shadow on the wall, then lurches into the light. She sniffs out the spot where Héctor painted Miguel's face, finding a canister of shoe polish. She lets out a low growl. 
The Dead Riveras follow after her. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Have you found him, Pepita?      Have you found our boy? 
Pepita breathes on the ground, revealing a footprint.   It glows for a moment. The family leans in to inspect. 
TÍA ROSITA A footprint! 
CHICHARRÓN Like the time you promised to bring back my van? 
HÉCTOR Uh... 
CHICHARRÓN Or my mini-fridge? 
HÉCTOR Ah, you see­- 
CHICHARRÓN Or my good napkins? My lasso?    My femur?! 
HÉCTOR No, no, not like those times. 
CHICHARRÓN Where's my femur?! You-- 
Chicharrón raises his finger to give a tongue lashing. But then he weakens and collapses in his hammock, a golden flicker flashing through his bones. Héctor rushes forward. 
HÉCTOR Whoa, whoa -- you okay, amigo? 
CHICHARRÓN I'm fading, Héctor. I can feel it. (looking to guitar) I couldn't even play that thing if I wanted to. (beat) You play me something. 
Héctor looks surprised. 
HÉCTOR You know I don't play anymore, Cheech. The guitar's for the kid-- 
CHICHARRÓN You want it, you got to earn it... 
Héctor sighs, then reaches over Chicharrón and takes the instrument. 
HÉCTOR Only for you, amigo.     Any requests? 
Héctor begins tuning the guitar. 
CHICHARRÓN You know my favorite, Héctor. 
Héctor begins a lovely, lilting tune. Chicharrón smiles. Miguel's eyes go wide at Héctor's skill. 
HÉCTOR (singing) WELL EVERYONE KNOWS JUANITA, HER EYES EACH A DIFFERENT COLOR. HER TEETH STICK OUT, AND HER CHIN GOES IN, AND HER... 
Héctor eyes Miguel. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) ...KNUCKLES THEY DRAG ON THE FLOOR. 
CHICHARRÓN Those aren't the words! 
HÉCTOR There are children present. (continuing) HER HAIR IS LIKE A BRIAR, SHE STANDS IN A BOW-LEGGED STANCE. AND IF I WEREN'T SO UGLY, SHE'D POSSIBLY GIVE ME A CHANCE! 
Héctor finishes with a soft flourish. 
Chicharrón is tickled, joyful.       For a moment he's present and bright. 
CHICHARRÓN Brings back memories.     Gracias... 
His eyes close.    He looks at peace.        Héctor looks sad. 
Suddenly, the edges of Chicharrón's bones begin to glow.         A soft, beautiful light. Then... he dissolves into dust. 
Miguel is stunned, concerned. 
Héctor picks up his shot glass, lifts it in honor, and drinks. He places it rim down next to Chicharrón's glass, which is still full. 
MIGUEL Wait... what happened? 
HÉCTOR He's been forgotten. (beat) When there's no one left in the living world who remembers you, you disappear from this world. We call it the "Final Death." 
MIGUEL Where did he go? 
HÉCTOR No one knows. 
Miguel has a thought. 
MIGUEL But I've met him... I could remember him, when I go back... 
HÉCTOR No, it doesn't work like that, chamaco. Our memories... they have to be passed down by those who knew us in life -- in the stories they tell about us. But there's no one left alive to pass down Cheech's stories... 
Miguel is deep in thought. 
Héctor puts his hand on Miguel's back, suddenly cheerful. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) Hey, it happens to everyone eventually. 
He gives Miguel the guitar. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) C'mon "de la Cruzcito." You've got a contest to win. 
Héctor throws open the curtain and exits.      Miguel looks back at the glasses, then turns and follows. 
EXT. LAND OF THE DEAD 
Héctor and Miguel hang off the back of a moving trolley. Miguel holds Héctor's photo in his hands, scanning it, while Héctor fiddles on the guitar idly. 
MIGUEL You told me you hated musicians, you never said you were one. 
HÉCTOR How do you think I knew your great- great grandpa? We used to play music together. Taught him everything he knows. 
Héctor plays a fancy riff, but botches the last note. 
MIGUEL No manches! You played with Ernesto de la Cruz, the greatest musician of all time? 
MIGUEL 'Cuz I don't just want to get de la Cruz's blessing. I need to prove that... that I'm worthy of it. 
HÉCTOR Oh. Oh, that's such a sweet sentiment... at SUCH a bad time! 
Héctor looks in Miguel's eyes.       The kid is sincere.   Despite himself, Héctor softens. 
HÉCTOR Okay... okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. (beat) Okay. (beat) Okay you wanna perform? Then you've got to PERFORM! 
Miguel perks, surprised that Héctor wants to help. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) First you have to loosen up.     Shake off those nerves! Sáquenlo sáquenlo, sáquenlo! 
Héctor does a loose-bone skeletal shimmy and Miguel copies. 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) Now gimme your best grito! 
MIGUEL My best grito? 
HÉCTOR Come on, yell! Belt it out! OOOOOOH HE-HE-HEY! Ha! Ah, feels good! Okay... now you. 
MIGUEL (uncertain) Ah -- ah -- ayyyyy yaaaaayyyyay... 
Dante whimpers. 
HÉCTOR Oh, c'mon kid... 
On stage, Los Chachalacos wrap up to raucous applause. 
STAGEHAND De la Cruzcito, you're on now! 
HÉCTOR Miguel, look at me. 
STAGEHAND Come on, let's go! 
HÉCTOR Hey!     Hey, look at me. (beat) (MORE) 
HÉCTOR (CONT'D) You can do this. Grab their attention and don't let it go! 
EMCEE (O.S.) We have one more act, amigos! 
MIGUEL Héctor... 
HÉCTOR Make 'em listen, chamaco!        You got this! 
EMCEE (O.S.) Damas y caballeros! De la Cruzcito! 
The crowd applauds as Miguel is led on stage. 
HÉCTOR Arre papá!     Hey! 
Héctor's face contorts with a mix of encouragement and dread. 
ON STAGE 
Miguel slowly takes the stage, guitar in hand.         He's blinded by the lights and squints out at the audience.         He's frozen stiff. 
OFF STAGE 
HÉCTOR (to Dante) What's he doing? Why isn't he playing? 
ON STAGE 
Panic is painted across Miguel's face. 
AUDIENCE MEMBER (O.S.) Bring back the singing dogs! 
The crowd begins to murmur impatiently.         Miguel looks to Héctor in the wing. 
Héctor makes eye contact with Miguel and does the "loosen up" bone shimmy. 
On stage Miguel shakes off his nerves.       Deep exhale and... 
MIGUEL HAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAAAAI-YAAAAAAAAI! 
The sound is full-throated and resonant. People in the audience whistle and whoop. Some return the grito, some applaud lightly. His brows go up and he begins his guitar intro. 
MIGUEL (singing) WHAT COLOR IS THE SKY? AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR YOU TELL ME THAT IT'S RED AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY SHOES? AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR YOU SAY PUT THEM ON YOUR HEAD AY MI AMOR, AY MI AMOR 
As the audience warms up, so does Miguel.      Héctor perks up, he's got this! 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) YOU MAKE ME UN POCO LOCO UN POQUI-TI-TI-TO LOCO THE WAY YOU KEEP ME GUESSING I'M NODDING AND I'M YES-ING I'LL COUNT IT AS A BLESSING THAT I'M ONLY UN POCO LOCO... 
INSTRUMENTAL INTERLUDE. Dante grabs Héctor by the leg and drags him onto the stage with Miguel. 
HÉCTOR No, no, no, no... 
Once in the spotlight, Héctor warms up and busts out some percussive footwork to Miguel's guitar. 
MIGUEL Not bad for a dead guy! 
HÉCTOR You're not so bad yourself, gordito! Eso! 
CUT TO: 
EDGE OF AUDIENCE 
A ripple of glowing footprints leads Pepita and the Dead Riveras to the edge of the audience. 
Miguel hustles to get away from Héctor. Dante bounds after him, but looks back and whimpers. He barks to get Miguel's attention. 
MIGUEL Dante, cállate! 
But Dante is insistent.      He tugs at Miguel's pants, pulling him back to Héctor. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) No, Dante!     Stop it! He can't help me! 
Dante grabs onto his hoodie sleeve. Miguel tries to shake him off, but his hoodie slips off, revealing the arms of a living boy. Dante redoubles his efforts. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) Dante, stop! Stop it! Leave me alone! You're not a spirit guide, you're just a dumb dog! Now get out of here! 
Miguel yanks his hoodie away from Dante, who shrinks back, rebuffed. The scuffle has drawn the eyes of the crowd. 
Startled skeletons see Miguel's arms.        He hurries to get his hoodie back on. 
CROWD MEMBERS It's him! / It's that living boy! / I heard about him. / Look! / He's alive! / The boy's alive. 
Miguel runs and jumps down some scaffolding. In the distance, he sees de la Cruz's tower. After only a few paces, Pepita lands in front of Miguel, cutting off his path! He skids to a stop. 
MIGUEL AAHH! 
Then, peeking over the jaguar's head is an even more terrifying sight: Mamá Imelda riding atop. 
MAMÁ IMELDA This nonsense ends now, Miguel! I am giving you my blessing and you are going home! 
MIGUEL I don't want your blessing! 
Miguel scrambles upright and bounds for a narrow alley staircase. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Miguel!   Stop! 
Not able to get through on her spirit guide, Imelda is forced to pursue Miguel on foot. 
EXT. NARROW STAIRCASE 
MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D) Come back!     Miguel! 
He wriggles through an iron gate. 
MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D) I am trying to save your life! 
She is stopped by the gate. 
MIGUEL You're ruining my life! 
MAMÁ IMELDA What? 
MIGUEL Music's the only thing that makes me happy. And you, you wanna take that away! (beat) You'll never understand. 
Miguel heads away from her up the stairs. 
MAMÁ IMELDA (singing) Y AUNQUE LA VIDA ME CUESTE, LLORONA... NO DEJARÉ DE QUERERTE... 
Miguel stops in his tracks.      When Imelda finishes, he turns back, confused. 
MIGUEL I thought you hated music. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Oh, I loved it. (reminiscing) I remember that feeling, when my husband would play, and I would sing and nothing else mattered. But when we had Coco, suddenly... there was something in my life that mattered more than music. I wanted to put down roots. He wanted to play for the world. 
Mamá Imelda pauses for a moment, lost in a memory. 
MAMÁ IMELDA (CONT'D) We each made a sacrifice to get what we wanted. Now you must make a choice. 
MIGUEL But I don't wanna... pick sides! (beat) Why can't you be on MY side? That's what family's supposed to do -- support you. (beat) But you never will. 
Miguel wipes the corner of his eye, frustrated. Imelda is shocked to see him so hurt, but Miguel turns away before she can answer and ascends the narrow staircase toward de la Cruz's tower. 
EXT. BOTTOM OF THE TOWER 
Miguel arrives at the foot of the hill to de la Cruz's tower. 
Vehicles from all eras (limousines, motor cars, carriages) drop off finely dressed guests who line up to get aboard a funicular that scales the tower to the mansion. 
A couple at the front of the line show a fancy invitation to a SECURITY GUARD, who then lets them onto the funicular. 
SECURITY GUARD Have a good time. 
GUEST Oh, how exciting! 
EL SANTO, the silver-masked luchador, produces a fancy invitation to the security guard. 
SECURITY GUARD Oh!  El Santo! (giddy) I'm a big fan. 
The security guard sheepishly holds up a camera. 
SECURITY GUARD You mind if I-- 
El Santo nods. The security guard removes his head and hands it to the luchador for a selfie. His body proceeds to take the photo. 
SECURITY GUARD Gracias, señor! 
The security guard puts his head back on and El Santo heads past the velvet rope. Miguel is revealed waiting in line behind him. 
SECURITY GUARD Invitation? 
MIGUEL It's okay. I'm Ernesto's great- great grandson! 
Miguel's soul pours into the strings as he approaches his hero-- 
MIGUEL FOR THIS MUSIC IS MY LANG-- 
SPLASH!   Miguel tumbles into the indoor pool. 
The party-goers gasp, but it's Ernesto who rolls up his sleeves, and, in true movie hero fashion, jumps into the pool and lifts a coughing Miguel to the edge. 
DE LA CRUZ Are you all right, niño? 
Miguel looks up, mortified. His painted face begins to run, revealing him to be a living boy. De la Cruz's eyes go wide. The crowd gasps and murmurs. 
DE LA CRUZ It's you... you, you are that boy, the one who came from the Land of the Living. 
MIGUEL You... know about me? 
DE LA CRUZ You are all anyone has been talking about! Why have you come here? 
MIGUEL I'm Miguel. Your great-great grandson. 
More murmuring from the crowd.       De la Cruz is shocked. 
DE LA CRUZ I... have a great-great grandson? 
MIGUEL I need your blessing. So I can go back home and be a musician, just like you. (beat) (MORE) 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) The rest of our family, they wouldn't listen. But I... I hoped you would? 
DE LA CRUZ My boy, with a talent like yours, how could I not listen? 
Miguel hugs de la Cruz who sweeps Miguel up onto his shoulders, showing him off to the room. 
DE LA CRUZ I HAVE A GREAT-GREAT GRANDSON! 
The crowd roars. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BOTTOM OF THE TOWER 
CROWD Look, it's Frida! 
The silhouette of Frida Kahlo steps up to the security guard. 
HÉCTOR Yes, it is I. Frida Kahlo. 
The security guard lets her in immediately.     No need to check the list. 
SECURITY GUARD It is an honor, señora! 
HÉCTOR Gracias... 
Hector steps onto the funicular, readjusting his unibrow to maintain his diguise. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S MANSION 
Quick cuts over instrumental version of "Remember Me:" 
De la Cruz barges into several conversations, proudly introducing Miguel. He seems almost giddy. They wedge themselves into a group laughing in the garden (which includes Jorge Negrete & Pedro Infante): 
DE LA CRUZ Hey Negrete! Infante! Have you met my great-great-grandson? 
CUT TO: 
De la Cruz and Miguel ride up on horseback while guests play polo: 
DE LA CRUZ My great-great grandson! 
CUT TO: 
In the parlor: 
DE LA CRUZ He's alive! And a musician to boot! 
CUT TO: 
Miguel chats away with de la Cruz and guests. 
MIGUEL Dimple.   No dimple.      Dimple.   No dimple. 
De la Cruz laughs, delighted. 
DE LA CRUZ No dimple! 
CUT TO: 
A film clip is projected in the main hall. 
ON SCREEN: Don Hidalgo turns raising two glasses.         Miguel acts along with the clip. 
DON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP) To our friendship!... 
DON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP)                        MIGUEL ...I would move Heaven and            ...I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo.              Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud!                                Salud! 
In the clip Don Hidalgo and de la Cruz drink.        De la Cruz spits. 
He looks from the picture to the gray, faded skeleton who kneels before him. Héctor looks weak. 
DE LA CRUZ My friend... you're being forgotten... 
HÉCTOR And whose fault is that? 
DE LA CRUZ Héctor, please-- 
HÉCTOR Those were MY songs you took.     MY songs that made YOU famous. 
MIGUEL W-What? 
HÉCTOR If I'm being forgotten, it's because you never told anyone that I wrote them-- 
MIGUEL That's crazy, de la Cruz wrote all his own songs. 
HÉCTOR (to de la Cruz) You wanna tell him, or should I? 
DE LA CRUZ Héctor, I never meant to take credit. (beat) (MORE) 
DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D) We made a great team but -- you died and I -- I only sang your songs because I wanted to keep a part of you alive. 
HÉCTOR Oh, how generous. 
MIGUEL You really did play together... 
HÉCTOR Look, I don't want to fight about it. I just want you to make it right. Miguel can put my photo up-- 
DE LA CRUZ Héctor... 
HÉCTOR --And I can cross over the bridge. I can see my girl. 
De la Cruz looks at the photo, deliberating. 
HÉCTOR Ernesto... Remember the night I left? 
DE LA CRUZ That was a long time ago. 
HÉCTOR We drank together and you told me you would move heaven and earth for your amigo. Well, I'm asking you to now. 
MIGUEL Heaven and earth?     Like in the movie? 
HÉCTOR What? 
MIGUEL That's Don Hidalgo's toast... in the de la Cruz movie, "El Camino A Casa." 
HÉCTOR I'm talking about my real life, Miguel. 
MIGUEL No, it's in there.    Look. 
Miguel looks around and points to the movie clip projected across the room. 
FILM CLIP: 
DON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP) Never were truer words spoken. This calls for A TOAST! To our friendship! I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. 
MIGUEL But in the movie, Don Hidalgo poisons the drink... 
DON HIDALGO (FILM CLIP) Salud! 
In the clip Don Hidalgo and de la Cruz drink.      De la Cruz spits his drink. 
DE LA CRUZ (FILM CLIP) Poison! 
Héctor's gears are turning too. 
HÉCTOR That night, Ernesto.    The night I left... 
FLASHBACK: 
INT. MEXICO CITY HOTEL ROOM 
Héctor throws a songbook in a suitcase, shuts it.     He grabs his guitar case like he means to leave. 
HÉCTOR (V.O.) We'd been performing on the road for months. I got homesick -- and I packed up my songs... 
YOUNG DE LA CRUZ You wanna give up now? When we're this close to reaching our dream? 
YOUNG HÉCTOR This was your dream. You'll manage. 
YOUNG DE LA CRUZ I can't do this without your songs, Héctor-- 
De la Cruz grabs young Héctor's suitcase, but Héctor pulls away. 
YOUNG HÉCTOR I'm going home, Ernesto. (beat) Hate me if you want, but my mind is made up. 
De la Cruz looks angry.      For a moment his face darkens.    But he composes himself. 
YOUNG DE LA CRUZ Oh, I could never hate you. If you must go, then I'm... I'm sending you off with a toast! 
De la Cruz pours a couple of drinks.         He gives one to Héctor. 
YOUNG DE LA CRUZ (CONT'D) To our friendship. I would move Heaven and Earth for you, mi amigo. Salud! 
They both drink. 
EXT. EMPTY STREET 
MIGUEL No, NO! 
EXT. DE LA CRUZ'S TOWER 
The guards drag Miguel out the back of de la Cruz's mansion. 
MIGUEL Let go! 
They throw him into a cenote, an inescapable sinkhole behind the estate. 
INT. CENOTE 
MIGUEL NO!   AHHHHHH! 
He falls four stories and splashes into the pool at the bottom of the hole. He breaks the surface and swims to a stone island in the center. 
MIGUEL Help! Can anyone hear me?        I wanna go home! 
Miguel collapses on the stone island. 
His soaked hoodie sags off his shoulders.        The skeletal transition is almost complete. 
A moment of silence.     He is alone. 
Suddenly, Miguel hears a noise. Footsteps. Héctor emerges from the darkness, looking beat up. Héctor stumbles. 
MIGUEL Héctor? 
HÉCTOR Kid? 
MIGUEL Oh, Héctor! 
They run to each other.      Héctor embraces Miguel.   But Miguel is overcome with shame. 
MIGUEL You were right. I should have gone back to my family-- 
Héctor tries to calm him but Miguel is shaking. 
HÉCTOR Hey -- hey, hey... 
MIGUEL They told me not to be like de la Cruz, but I didn't listen-- 
HÉCTOR Hey, it's okay... 
MIGUEL I told them I didn't care if they remembered me. I didn't care if I was on their stupid ofrenda. 
Héctor holds Miguel to his chest.       Miguel is tense. 
HÉCTOR Hey, chamaco, it's okay.         It's okay. 
MIGUEL I told them I didn't care. 
Suddenly, a golden flicker flutters through Héctor's bones, and he falls to his knees. 
HÉCTOR Hhuuh! 
MIGUEL Héctor!   Héctor-- 
HÉCTOR She's... forgetting me. 
Miguel looks at Héctor with concern. 
MIGUEL Who? 
HÉCTOR My daughter... 
MIGUEL She's the reason you wanted to cross the bridge... 
HÉCTOR I just wanted to see her again... (beat) I never should have left Santa Cecilia. I wish I could apologize. I wish I could tell her that her papá was trying to come home. That he loved her so much. (beat) My Coco... 
A chill runs through Miguel. 
MIGUEL Coco? 
Miguel reaches into his hoodie and pulls out the photo of Imelda, Coco, and the faceless musician. 
Miguel shows the photo to Héctor.       Héctor is confused; it's like he's seen a ghost. 
HÉCTOR Where... where did you get this? 
MIGUEL That's my Mamá Coco. That's my Mamá Imelda. Is that... you? 
Gears turn in both of their heads. 
HÉCTOR We're... 
HÉCTOR                              MIGUEL ...family?                           ...family? 
Héctor is as shocked as Miguel.       He looks at his great-great grandson. 
He looks to the photo, touches the image of baby Coco, and he becomes saddened. 
HÉCTOR I always hoped I'd see her again. That she'd miss me... maybe put up my photo. But it never happened. (beat) You know the worst part? (beat) Even if I never got to see Coco in the living world... I thought at least one day I'd see her here. Give her the biggest hug... (beat) But she's the last person who remembers me. The moment she's gone from the living world... 
MIGUEL You disappear... from this one. You'll never get to see her... 
HÉCTOR ...Ever again. 
They dismount from Pepita. Héctor falls off first but gets up and raises his arm to help Imelda. She gives him a withering stare and dismounts without his help. Miguel pets Dante and Pepita gives Miguel a big lick. 
Imelda rounds Pepita's shoulder and folds Miguel into a tight hug. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Mijo, I was so worried! Thank goodness we found you in time! 
Imelda's eyes fall on Héctor, who holds his hat in his hands sheepishly. 
MAMÁ IMELDA And you! How many times must I turn you away? 
HÉCTOR Imelda-- 
MAMÁ IMELDA I want nothing to do with you. Not in life, not in death! (beat) I spent decades protecting my family from your mistakes. He spends five minutes with you and I have to fish him out of a sinkhole! 
Miguel steps between Imelda and Héctor. 
MIGUEL I wasn't in there `cause of Héctor. He was in there `cause of me. (beat) He was just trying to get me home... I didn't wanna listen, but he was right... nothing is more important than family. 
Mamá Imelda looks at Héctor, shocked to hear the sentiment. 
MIGUEL (CONT'D) I'm ready to accept your blessing... and your conditions. But first, I need to find de la Cruz. To get Héctor's photo. 
MAMÁ IMELDA What? 
MIGUEL So he can see Coco again.        Héctor should be on our ofrenda.        He's part of our family-- 
MAMÁ IMELDA He left this family! 
MIGUEL He tried to go home to you and Coco... but de la Cruz murdered him! 
Startled, she looks to Héctor for confirmation. 
HÉCTOR It's true, Imelda. 
Imelda wrestles with her emotions. 
MAMÁ IMELDA And so what if it's true? You leave me alone with a child to raise and I'm just supposed to forgive you? 
HÉCTOR Imelda, I-- 
Héctor's body suddenly shimmers, leaving him winded.   Imelda gasps. 
MIGUEL Héctor? 
HÉCTOR I'm running out of time.         It's Coco... 
MAMÁ IMELDA She's forgetting you... 
MIGUEL You don't have to forgive him... But we shouldn't forget him. 
MAMÁ IMELDA (to Héctor) I wanted to forget you. I wanted Coco to forget you too, but-- 
HÉCTOR This is my fault, not yours. (beat) I'm sorry, Imelda. 
Mamá Imelda, holding in her emotions, turns to Miguel. 
MAMÁ IMELDA Miguel, if we help you get his photo... you will return home?          No more music? 
MIGUEL Family comes first. 
Mamá Imelda considers.      She turns to Héctor. 
MAMÁ IMELDA I -- I can't forgive you.        But I will help you. 
Miguel smiles. 
MAMÁ IMELDA (to Miguel) So how do we get to de la Cruz? 
Miguel furrows his brow. 
MIGUEL I might know a way... 
EXT. SUNRISE SPECTACULAR AMPHITHEATER - BEFORE DAWN 
Crowds are congregated at de la Cruz's Sunrise Spectacular which takes place in an open air amphitheater. They hurry to their seats as the lights begin to dim. 
ON STAGE 
Frida's performance piece begins. Dramatic symphonic music plays as a giant papaya appears to ignite on stage. The "seeds" in the body of the papaya unfurl to reveal that they are dancers, each dressed like Frida Kahlo, right down to the painted on unibrow. 
The dancers roll out of the "flaming" papaya and gyrate their bodies nonsensically. 
A giant cactus that resembles Frida is illuminated, and all the dancers slink to it. 
In the midst of this, eight familiar looking dancers (the Dead Riveras and Miguel) inch their way out of the spotlights and to the wings of the stage. 
STAGE WING 
FRIDA Good luck, muchacho. 
MIGUEL Gracias Frida! 
INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 
The Dead Riveras congregate in a hidden backstage corridor, shedding their Frida outfits. Miguel rips off his unibrow. 
MIGUEL Ow! 
MIGUEL AHHH! 
HÉCTOR NO! 
The family runs to the ledge, horrified. 
TÍO OSCAR/TÍO FELIPE Miguel! 
MAMÁ IMELDA Miguel! 
CUT TO: 
STADIUM 
The audience gasps.     Some shrieks. 
BACK TO: 
BACKSTAGE 
De la Cruz crosses from the ledge, past Héctor, who remains collapsed on the floor, breathless. 
DE LA CRUZ Apologies old friend, but the show must go on... 
CUT TO: 
Miguel is in free fall, the photo still in his hand. As the wind whips against his face, he hears a faint howling. 
Dante slices downward through the air, catches Miguel's shirt in his teeth, and opens his wings. He and Miguel jerk upward, but the photo falls from Miguel's hands and is gone from sight. 
Miguel and Dante twist in the air, Dante trying to slow their decent but the two of them are too heavy. Miguel's shirt rips and Dante loses him. 
Miguel plummets toward the base of the tower. Suddenly Pepita flies in and scoops up Miguel. Dante follows close behind. Miguel looks over the side of Pepita down towards the water. 
The photo is lost.

BACKSTAGE 
De la Cruz steps up to the curtain, slicks back his hair, and emerges to his audience. 
ON STAGE 
De la Cruz is found by a spotlight. 
DE LA CRUZ Ha ha! 
He is met with boos.      He looks confused. 
CROWD Boo!    Murderer! 
DE LA CRUZ Please, please, mi familia... 
AUDIENCE MEMBER Get off the stage! 
More booing.    De la Cruz tries to kick up the orchestra. 
DE LA CRUZ Orchestra!     A-one-A-two-A-one-- 
The conductor snaps his baton.        More booing. 
DE LA CRUZ (singing) REMEMBER ME, THOUGH I HAVE TO-- (beat) Hey!-- 
The crowd pelts de la Cruz with fruit and offerings. 
CROWD MEMBER Look! 
Crowd members point up to the screen. Pepita rises above the ledge with Miguel on her back. Miguel slides off her wing and runs to his family. 
CROWD MEMBER He's alright! 
The crowd cheers.     There are sighs of relief. 
De la Cruz, seeing this     play out on screen, realizes his backstage treachery has     been projected to the whole world. He watches horrified as     the image of Pepita grows larger and larger on the screen as     she prowls past the camera. 
De la Cruz begins to back up just as Pepita emerges through the curtain, eyes locked on him. 
DE LA CRUZ Nice kitty... 
Suddenly Pepita head-butts de la Cruz and lifts him into the sky, flinging the singer in the air like a kitten playing with a ball of yarn. 
DE LA CRUZ AAAHHHH! Put me down! No, please! I beg of you, stop! Stop! NO! 
She swings him around to gain momentum, then throws him over the audience. 
DE LA CRUZ NO!   AAAHHH! 
He flies out of the stadium, hitting a giant church bell in the distance. The stadium erupts in cheers. 
In the midst of the cheering, an unsuspecting crowd member returns from concessions. 
CROWD MEMBER What did I miss?

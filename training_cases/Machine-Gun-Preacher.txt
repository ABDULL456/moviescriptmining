MACHINE GUN PREACHER 
Written by

based on the life of Sam Childers 
FINAL SHOOTING DRAFT 
This is true... 
EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT - (2003) 
The night is stillborn. 
Without sound or movement and nothing is in definition. All we see are degrees of blackness in this unlit world. The vague impressions of an African village in the void... a ragged line of tukuls (straw huts)... a bicycle propped against a mud wall... a soccer ball in the dirt... 
INT. TUKUL - NIGHT 
And we find a Sudanese family asleep on reed mats. A mother, father and their two boys. The younger boy we'll come to know as "WILLIAM" (9). His older brother "CHRISTOPHER" (12) curled next to him. 
EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT 
And slowly the blackness begins to shift... an otherworldly light seeping in from someplace far off... shadows contorting in a ghostly orange flicker... images emerging... the silhouettes of men coming into this village carrying flaming torches. 
INT. TUKUL - NIGHT 
The family still sound asleep, oblivious to the torch glow coming from outside, and suddenly -- 
SCREAMING! -- GUNSHOTS! 
The family bolts awake, moving to their feet as the door to their tukul SLAMS open -- THREE soldiers from the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) coming in carrying AK47's -- shouting in Arabic -- "Get up! Get up!" -- the FATHER stepping forward -- holding up his hands -- "Don't shoot!" -- 
KAK! KAK! KAK! 
And he's gunned down in cold blood. The soldiers grab the mother and boys and begin to drag them out of the tukul -- but WILLIAM breaks free -- scrambles deeper into the room -- 
THE SOLDIER going after him -- WILLIAM darting behind a stack of storage boxes knocking them to the ground -- frantically burrowing into the corner -- trying to get away but it's useless -- THE SOLDIER grabs his feet and begins to pull him out -- WILLIAM KICKING WILDLY -- digging his nails into the dirt -- and as he's dragged out of the corner he reaches out... inadvertently grabs a FADED PHOTOGRAPH which has fallen on the ground... 
EXT. VILLAGE - NIGHT 
CHAOS! -- PANDEMONIUM! -- the black sky ablaze in apocalyptic fire -- 
families yanked out of their burning tukuls by LRA rebels -- the adult males of this village shot dead or bludgeoned to death -- the women and children forced into the center of the village -- huddled together and weeping -- 
-- and now we see WILLIAM hauled out -- his captor shouting to another soldier -- pointing to WILLIAM'S mother and she's pulled from the group and forced onto her knees... 
... and WILLIAM is brought in front of her -- his captor saying something in Arabic as he hands him a club -- "Kill her!" -- WILLIAM shaking his head `no' -- tossing the club in the dirt and -- 
CRACKKK! -- WILLIAM is hit with the butt of a rifle -- goes down -- blood streaming down his face as he's pulled back up to his feet -- crying -- shaking with fear... 
... and then he sees his mother staring up at him... and despite the hell unfolding around them we see a moment here between mother and son... something calm and reassuring in the way she's looking at him now... her eyes full of love... and pity... for her child in this terrible moment... and before we see how this ends we -- 
CUT TO: 
BLACKNESS 
FOR A LONG BEAT -- AND THEN WE BLEED UP WHITE LETTERS ON THE BLACK SCREEN THAT READ -- 
MACHINEGUN PREACHER ... AND THEN THE ECHOED VOICES OF MEN YELLING TO ONE ANOTHER... BOOMING MUSIC... TAUNTS... WHISTLES... AN ANNOUNCEMENT, INAUDIBLE, OVER A LOUDSPEAKER... TAKING US TO... 
INT. PRISON CORRIDOR - RURAL PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - (AUGUST/1998) 
And we see SAM CHILDERS coming down a corridor toward us, dressed in jailhouse orange and flanked by a guard. He's stocky, 32 years old, with a biker's handlebar moustache. On the surface he appears good- looking... even handsome if the light is right... but his face is tricky... always changing... behind the quick smile, around his dark eyes, in the taut muscles of his neck we see violence. 
INT. PRISON RECEIVING AND RELEASING - DAY 
We see a CLERK handing Sam a prison issue tub full of his personal affects. He takes out his clothes, digs out a leather wallet, a watch, some silver rings and a lighter. 
He looks up to the Clerk and flashes a malicious smile -- 
SAM Ya'll go fuck yourself now, k? 
EXT. PRISON - DAY 
A beat-up CHEVY VEGA parked at the curb. Sam's wife, LYNN, 30's, in a thrift store dress, leaning against the car, waiting. 
Sam (dressed in civilian clothes now) pushes out a door and she sees him, straightens her hair, an uneasy smile. 
LYNN Hey baby. 
EXT SIDE OF ROAD/INT. LYNN'S CAR - DAY 
The Vega pulled of the side of the road and Sam fucking Lynn in the back. There's nothing tender about what we're watching here. Sam finishes and Lynn slumps into the seat, pulls down her dress. 
SAM Gimme a smoke. 
LYNN Don't got any. 
SAM What, you quit? (LYNN NODS) Shit, that ain't gonna last. 
EXT. MOBILE HOME PARK - DAY 
The Vega pulls up to a beat-to-shit single-wide and Sam and Lynn get out. We see a homemade sign hanging outside the trailer that reads, "Welcome Home Daddy!" 
And now Sam's daughter PAIGE (6) bursts out of the trailer and down the steps... Followed by Sam's mother, DAISY, mid 60's, comes out of the trailer. 
PAIGE DADDY! 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Sam riding down the road. 
INT. CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT 
A tough biker bar in Johnstown, PA. A jukebox in the corner playing Lynard Skynard. Sam coming through the door, AD-LIBBED greetings from some of the other bikers here. He makes his way to a back table where a hulking biker in a leather vest named DONNIE is sitting with two girls. Donnie looks up, sees Sam... 
DONNIE Crazyhorse! There he is... 
They embrace, old friends. 
DONNIE (CONT'D) Figured you'd be rollin out round now. How you doin, buddy? 
SAM I'm doin. 
DONNIE (to one of the girls) Get us a coupla shots and buds. (SAM SITS) Don't look too worse for the wear. 
SAM I'm alright. 
DONNIE Heard yer old lady ain't at the Bunny Hop no more. 
SAM Bitch found Jesus. 
DONNIE Damn! That bearded sonuvagun slipped her the high holy dick while you was in the can, huh? Better him than the milk man, I guess. 
SAM Ain't so sure bout that. 
Donnie laughs, slaps him on the shoulder... 
DONNIE You wanna taste? 
Sam smiles that wicked smile and we go -- 
INT. BACK HALLWAY - THE CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT 
-- as a biker chick leads Sam down this hallway into -- 
INT. BATHROOM - THE CROSSROADS BAR - NIGHT 
Sam and the biker chick crammed into this dirty stall, Skynard pounding through the walls. He rolls up his shirt sleeve as she cooks a spoon of methamphetamine... juices a hypodermic... he finds a vein and she spikes his arm... presses the plunger and his head rolls back on his shoulders... speed slamming into his bloodstream as we RAMP UP THE MUSIC. 
INT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - MORNING - WEEKS LATER - (DECEMBER/1998) 
Snow piled up on the windowsills and it's cold as shit outside. Sam passed out on the couch and this guy looks like hell. 
Thinner than the last time we saw him, skin sallow and drawn tight over his face. He stirs awake, sees Paige playing by herself on the floor next to him. She sees that he's awake, picks up her doll, and quietly goes outside without saying a word. 
INT. BATHROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - MORNING 
Sam coming in, taking a piss, staring at himself in the mirror and we see a junkie map of track marks running up and down his arms. And then WE HEAR a Pentecostal communion hymn, "the Old Rugged Cross", coming through... taking us to... 
INT. CHURCH - JOHNSTOWN, PA. - DAY 
A congregation packed into this church for Sunday service. We see Lynn and Paige in the crowd, singing along with the congregation. 
EXT. DOPE HOUSE STREET/INT. DONNIE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Sam and Donnie in this car, parked in front of broken down clapboard houses. Donnie pointing through the windshield... 
DONNIE Right there. With the green light. 
EXT. PORCH - DOPE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Bone chill cold. Sam and Donnie on this porch, scarves pulled around their necks, hands shoved into their jackets trying to stay warm. Donnie KNOCKING at the door... 
DONNIE Hey, man, you there?! Open up... 
Donnie KNOCKING again and the door cracks an inch... and we see a black man with a SHAVED HEAD on the other side looking out... 
SHAVED HEAD Fuck are you? 
DONNIE It's me, man, c'mon. Fuckin cold out here. 
SHAVED HEAD I don't know you. 
DONNIE Yeah you do, man. I saw you the other day. I'm Bobby's friend. 
SHAVED HEAD Who the fuck is Bobby? 
Suddenly Sam pulls a short barrel shotgun from his jacket -- MOSSBERG 10 GAGE -- presses it to the door and -- 
BOOOM! 
INT. DOPE HOUSE - SAME 
DOOR SPLINTERING OPEN! -- concussion like a fucking pipe bomb -- wood splintering through the room like shrapnel -- Sam and Donnie STORMING IN... 
DONNIE Don't fuckin move! 
INSTANT PANDEMONIUM! -- JUNKIES hopping off the couch, scattering like rats deeper into the house -- SHAVED HEAD darting out of the room -- Sam leveling the MOSSBERG in his direction -- 
BOOOM! -- the room flashing like a fucking supernova. 
INT. STAIRWAY- DOPE HOUSE - SAME 
SHAVED HEAD scrambling up these stairs -- Sam coming up after him -- hunting him -- MOSSBERG BLASTING in his direction -- BOOOM! -- 
INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - DOPE HOUSE - SAME 
Suddenly -- silver flashing -- A BLADE -- out of nowhere -- pressed into Donnie's neck from the backseat -- the Drifter pulling him tight against the seat rest, pressing it into his throat -- 
DONNIE What the fuck?! 
DRIFTER Keep drivin! Dunshore or I'll cut his fuckin throat. 
SAM Get that fuckin blade off him... 
Sam reaches his leg over and STOMPS ON THE GAS PEDDLE -- the car LURCHES forward -- accelerating -- 
DONNIE Sam! 
DRIFTER SLOW THE FUCK DOWN! 
But Sam's not letting up... pressing down on the peddle hard... 90... 100... 110 mph -- Donnie YELLING -- trying to keep the car on the road -- MUSIC BLARING -- like some wild ride to hell and then -- 
SAM SUDDENLY JUMPS IN THE BACKSEAT -- wrestling with the drifter -- fighting wild -- elbowing him in the face and somehow the blade is in his hand now -- and -- 
Stick, stick, stick, stick, stick, stick! 
He stabs him six times in the gut. The drifter HOWLING in pain. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT 
Donnie's car skidding off the shoulder of the road, back door popping open and the Drifter's body dumped into the dirt. The car PEELS OUT, accelerates, tail lights disappearing into the dark. 
INT. BEDROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT 
Lynn sound asleep in bed. And she slowly stirs awake, hears water running from somewhere in the trailer. 
INT. HALLWAY AND BATHROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - NIGHT 
Lynn moving down the hall... toward a sliver of light coming from under the closed bathroom door... gently pushing it open to see -- 
Sam standing at the sink... covered in blood... frantically trying to clean himself up... trying to wash the sin from his skin and clothes but it's useless... and the sense we get is that we're staring at a man at the edge of an abyss... set to swallow him whole... terrified... shaking... 
... and now he realizes Lynn is here and he turns to her... holding up his stained hands... a terrible fear in his eyes when he says... 
SAM Help me. 
EXT. CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY 
Days later and we see Lynn and Paige, dressed up, sitting in the idling car, waiting. 
PAIGE He comin or ain't he? 
LYNN I don't know. 
INT. BEDROOM - CHILDERS MOBILE HOME - DAY 
And we find Sam in this bedroom all alone, wearing a thrift store sportcoat, sitting on the edge of the bed. Frozen. Staring at his stocking feet and three or four pairs of workboots scattered on the floor. 
Lynn steps into the doorway... 
VOICE (O.S.) Honey? You ready? 
Sam turns to her, and he looks lost here. Like a little boy. 
SAM I don't got no good shoes, Lynn. 
And she comes into the room, sits on the bed next to him, puts an arm around his shoulder. 
LYNN He don't care what kinda shoes you wearin, baby. 
INT. BAPTISM CHURCH - JOHNSTOWN, PA. - DAY 
Packed with Sunday families listening to Pastor Krause at the pulpit. Behind him we see a BAPTISMAL TANK filled with water. And now we see Sam, Lynn, Paige, and Daisy sitting near the back. Sam looks uncomfortable, on edge. 
PASTOR KRAUSE The point of receiving God's word is life. Life upon life. And to accept the blood of Jesus is life upon life upon life... 
CONGREGATION Praise be to God! 
PASTOR KRAUSE He breathes his spirit into darkness and makes something good. He sees our shadow and says, `let there be light!" 
CONGREGATION Amen! 
PASTOR KRAUSE ... now proclaim his saving grace! If there are sinners here looking for God raise your hands! 
A few hands shoot up -- 
PASTOR KRAUSE (CONT'D) Stand up! Receive Jesus Christ as your light and saviour... 
Three or four people moving to their feet, making their way up to the altar. Lynn turns to Sam, their eyes meet. He looks hesitant, unsure. She gives him a reserved little smile, nods her head slightly as if saying "you can do this"... 
And in her look he finds strength, gets up, slowly makes his way to... 
FRONT ALTAR 
And now we see Sam on his knees in the baptismal tank. The water almost up to his waist. Pastor Krause kneeling behind him. 
PASTOR KRAUSE (CONT'D) Receive Jesus as your Lord and Saviour... in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost... 
... and he leans Sam back, cradling his head as he submerges him in the water completely... and when Sam comes back up the church breaks into ROWDY HALLELUJAHS!... and we see Lynn... tears in her eyes... 
clapping in the back row... and an organist and singer begin to sing "Amazing Grace" taking us to... 
OMITTED 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY - (JUNE/1999) 
... Sam and Deng crammed into this crowded bus... 
SAM They always drive this fast? 
DENG Traveling is the most dangerous time in Sudan. If the rebels find you on the open road it would be very bad. 
An awkward silence as Deng stares out the window. Sam wanting to connect here, but Deng is reticent. 
SAM You got kids, Deng? 
DENG No. I have no children. 
SAM Where you from? 
DENG A little village called Aweil. Many hours from here. 
SAM That's where your family is? 
And Deng simply says... 
DENG My family was killed by LRA. (BEAT) Unyama is about two hours from here. We will stop there for lunch. 
Deng turns and looks out the window again, silent, quietly watching the land blur past. And Sam says nothing more, intuitively feeling this man's need to be alone in the moment. A great, lost giant. 
EXT. UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY 
A dense sea of people. 20,000 displaced refugees living on top of each other. 
Life is lived out in the open here... women bent over brightly colored washtubs sloshing clothes in soapy water... smoke from giant cooking pots drifting into the air... semi-clothed children, some with even younger children on their hips, running everywhere. The poverty and hopelessness is overwhelming. 
And we see Sam and Deng walking through the camp... 
DENG The Muslim North has tried to kill the Christian South for 30 years. Two million have lost their lives... 
Deng sweeping his hand, indicating the mass of refugees. 
DENG (CONT'D) ... these people have been driven from their villages, however these camps are not much better... 
EXT. MEDICAL AREA - UNYAMA REFUGEE CAMP, UGANDA - DAY 
A row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area. Each enclosure jammed with the desperately sick. Battle-weary AID WORKERS move among them, doing what they can, caring for the ones who are most desperately ill. 
DENG Cholera and Malaria are everywhere, there is little food and not enough UN soldiers to protect everyone. Even here they worry the LRA will attack at night. 
And another SPLA soldier comes up to Deng -- 
SPLA SOLDIER 1 (ARABIC) Are you from Kitgum? 
DENG (ARABIC) Yes. 
SPLA SOLDIER 1 (ARABIC) Someone wants to speak with you. 
Deng turns to Sam... 
DENG I'm sorry, Sam... I'll be five minutes. 
SAM Course, do what you gotta do. 
Deng leaves and now Sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of humanity all around him. And suddenly there's COMMOTION! -- two aid workers coming into this tent carrying a WOMAN on a stretcher. One of the aid workers looking around -- a white woman -- mid 30's -- her name is AGNETE CLOSSON, Regional Director of Doctors Without Borders. She sees Sam across the tent. 
AGNETE Excuse me. You. Can you help please? 
Sam moving to her -- 
AGNETE (CONT'D) We need to transfer her to the bed. Get her shoulders... 
Sam grabbing the woman underneath the shoulders as another aid worker gets her feet... 
AGNETE (CONT'D) One, two, three... 
And they swing the woman over to a cot... but as they do the sheer piece of blood-stained muslin that was covering her face falls away... and we see that she has been mutilated... her lips cut off of her face... 
... and now a DOCTOR sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her. Sam and Agnete pushed back, away from the action. Sam still shocked by what he's seen. 
SAM What happened to her face? 
AGNETE The rebels cut off her lips because she argued. These are Kony's orders. 
SAM Who's Kony? 
Agnete, suddenly suspicious, takes an appraising look of Sam. 
AGNETE Who are you with? 
SAM I'm with Deng over there. 
AGNETE What organization are you with? 
SAM Working with a Christian group down South. Just up here takin a look around, seein a bit of the country. 
AGNETE This isn't a tourist destination, this is a war zone. You stay in this area, you'll be killed. (BEAT) Thank you for your help. 
And she walks off. 
EXT. NIMULE, SUDAN - DUSK 
Establishing a bustling trading center on the border of Uganda and Sudan. Noisy and overpopulated, a maze of concrete and tin buildings, hundreds of people on the streets, riding bicycles, finishing their business before nightfall. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT 
DENG The LRA attacked a village last night. 
Sam looking up to him... 
DENG (CONT'D) You said you wanted to see. 
Sam sits up, looks around the hotel room and we see that it's empty... the children vanished... only a small, handmade toy on the ground which has been left behind. 
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - RURAL SUDAN - DAY 
Sam, Deng, and a few other SPLA SOLDIERS jammed into the flatbed of this truck, carrying heavy weapons, bouncing fast over this open dirt road... featureless savanna FADING into sporadic mud huts... the outskirts of a VILLAGE in the distance... and thin columns of black smoke twisting into the air... 
... and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass CHILDREN walking along the side of the road... night commuters returning to their village... some of them huddled together, weeping... 
... and we notice -- Sam notices -- the little boy in the GREEN SHORTS, walking hand-in-hand with his sister, their faces quiet masks of fear as they move closer to their home. 
EXT. VILLAGE - YEI, SUDAN - DAY 
The pickup arrives and Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers hop out... and this is what they see: 
Complete devastation. 30 or 40 bodies mutilated and stacked outside smoking tukuls. Some children already here, on their knees, weeping next to the corpses of their parents. If you could smell the air it would smell of burnt flesh and death. 
Sam silent, aghast, just staring at the horror all around him... 
... and now we see GREEN SHORTS and his sister arriving at the village... moving to their family's tukul and discovering their mother and father piled outside. Naked and burned alive. And the sister falls onto her mother's corpse and begins to wail as GREEN SHORTS stands there -- frozen -- staring down at his dead parents -- and suddenly -- 
MOVEMENT! -- from inside the tukul... a small dog... a family pet... darting into the open... running across the dirt... GREEN SHORTS going after it, yelling his name... 
Sam watching the boy chasing after his dog, rounding a corner out of sight... 
... for a moment... 
... just the boy's voice calling after his dog... and then... 
BOOOOM! 
A muffled burst -- in the distance -- Sam, Deng, and the other soldiers running out of the village toward the explosion... 
EXT. DIRT ROAD - YEI, SUDAN - DAY 
... Sam, Deng, and the others arriving at the source of the explosion. And we see GREEN SHORTS laying on the side of the road... cut in half by a land mine... his dead eyes wide open with surprise... 
... and Sam drops to his knees... lifting what's left of the boy into his arms and rocking him back and forth... and we watch as a terrible sadness overtakes him... something happening here... a fierce and overwhelming burden dropping into this man as he holds this dead boy... in the dirt... in the middle of this savage world... 
... and as Sam puts it, his "life changed forever" in this moment... and we see him looking up to the heavens... 
tears streaming down his face... saying something we can't hear, but it's a promise... to God... 
To save the children of Sudan. 
INT. PITTSBURGH AIRPORT - DAY 
A bright, fluorescent corridor filled with garish advertising and harried travelers rushing to make planes... and we find Sam coming down this concourse, carrying his duffle bag, his face expressionless. He reaches a revolving door but stops... doesn't pass through... sees Lynn, Paige, and his mother waiting for him on the other side... their happy, expectant faces... 
But they don't see him yet... and he just stays here... hidden... watching them through the glass... and as Sam puts it, at this moment he realized he would never look at his own family the same way again... in some way lost to them forever after what he saw on the side of road in Yei... 
... and finally he forces a smile, pushes through the revolving door and we watch, from this side of the glass, as Paige leaps into his arms... Lynn and Daisy moving to him too, embracing him, welcoming him home. 
INT. BATHROOM - PAIGE'S ROOM - CHILDERS HOUSE - NIGHT 
Paige brushing her teeth at the sink. Sam watching her from the doorway... 
PAIGE You see any tigers over there? 
SAM Naw, didn't see no tigers. 
PAIGE But they do have them over in Africa. 
SAM So I hear, but not where I was. 
PAIGE Sure am glad you're home. 
SAM Me too, bug. 
PAIGE I'm thinkin of a plane... 
SAM It's late, you better get to bed... 
And he grabs her and carries her into the bedroom, plops her onto the bed... 
PAIGE C'mon, plane... I'm thinkin of a plane... 
Sam giving in, playing their little game as she gets under the covers... 
SAM You said plane, I'm thinkin of a train... 
PAIGE You said train, I'm thinkin of a brain. 
SAM You said brain, I'm thinkin of a... (HESITATING) 
PAIGE Gotcha! 
SAM Ok, you got me. 
PAIGE You coulda said drain, or mane... like horse's hair. 
Sam bending over, kissing her forehead... 
SAM Sweet dreams, bug. 
She runs off. 
BIKER (CONT'D) Goddamn, they grow up quick, don't they? 
SAM Sure do. 
BIKER Hey, nuthin fer nuthin, Sam, but rumor has it you was puttin up a chapel over there in Central City. 
SAM That's right. Gonna minister to anybody who's lookin for The Lord. 
BIKER That's good, man. Maybe you can do somethin bout your old friend, Donnie. 
SAM What about em? 
BIKER He ain't doin so good, bro. But hey, good seein ya' man. 
EXT. CRACK HOUSE - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY 
A torn up house in a shitty part of town, windows spray painted black. Sam pulls up to the curb on his Harley, gets off, opens one of the bike's hard cases and pulls out the same SAWED OFF 10 gage we've seen before... chambers a slug as he moves toward the house... 
INT. CRACK HOUSE - JOHNSTOWN, PENN. - DAY 
Dark, junkie squalor. Two or three people slumped on a ratty couch, strung-out, watching a flickering TV -- and then -- 
THE FRONT DOOR CAVES IN! 
Sam coming into the house -- sawed-off leveled -- junkies scrambling for cover -- YELLING! -- CHAOS! -- Sam moving into -- 
INT. CRACK HOUSE - BACK ROOM - DAY 
Sam comes around the corner and finds himself face-to-face with a CRACKHEAD pointing a .357 MAGNUM -- eyes amped up and wild -- shaking -- a stand-off -- and Sam sees a body on a bare mattress in the b.g. -- bone thin and pale -- spent hypodermic hanging out of his arm -- 
It's Donnie. 
SAM I'm here for that boy right there. You gonna get in the way a that? 
A TENSE BEAT -- not sure how this is gonna go -- and then the CRACKHEAD shakes his head "no" 
INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY 
Donnie in a bed, covers pulled up to his neck and he's shaking bad, retching in a bucket, deep in the throes of a detox. Sam and Lynn here doing what they can, toweling off his forehead, trying to keep him warm, as Donnie pulls the sheets tighter, gritting his teeth, shaking his head. 
DONNIE I can't do this. 
SAM Look at me. God don't make trash, boy. Now he ain't givin up on you, so don't give up on him, you hear me? 
And somehow Donnie finds strength in his words, and in Sam's hand touching his head, and he nods. 
EXT. RURAL ROAD - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY - (AUGUST/2003) 
A bright Sunday morning and we're staring at the cinder block church which is almost completely finished... the sound of a garage band coming from inside, playing an unlikely rendition of a spiritual hymn... and a handful of people, dressed for service, moving up the cement stairs into... 
INT. ENTRY HALL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY 
And we see Donnie, dressed in his biker jacket and a buttondown shirt, sober for the moment, greeting people as they come through the front door. Standing next to him is Daisy handing out programs. 
DONNIE Welcome to Shekinah Fellowship Church. 
INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - DAY 
Still under construction. Exposed beams and bare insulation on the walls. There's a small riser at the front of the hall with an altar, organ, and the GARAGE BAND playing the rocked-out hymn. 
A handful of people here sitting in pews. FARMERS in clean overalls, FACTORY WORKERS, BIKERS still dressed in their riding leathers, listening to the garage band and chatting. 
And now we see Lynn and Paige (11) standing near the back. Lynn nervous, checking her watch. 
INT. FOYER - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY 
Sam on his knees, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, wrenching a leaking pipe. Lynn and Daisy walk in... 
LYNN It's five-til and he still ain't here. 
Sam hearing this, moving to his feet, toweling off his hands. 
SAM You call him? (LYNN NODS) Try him again. 
Lynn exits and Daisy steps forward, shuts the door behind her. Just she and Sam here alone now. 
DAISY You like this dress, Sam? 
SAM What, mom? 
DAISY You ain't never seen this one. I bought it a long time ago. Been keepin it for a special occasion. 
SAM It's nice. 
DAISY I never told you this but when I was pregnant with you, now this was way back, probably 1960, when yer daddy and I was still in Grand Rapids, a Pastor prophesied over me. Pulled me right up on stage and laid his hands on my belly and told me I was gonna have a Preacher for a son. (smiling at the thought) Yer daddy and I were so proud. I remember we went home and neither of us could sleep all night. Just laid there and talked bout you, bout what was comin. 
SAM I just built a church. I ain't no preacher. 
DAISY Yes you are. You were born to it. Just took you a little ways to get here. 
INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY 
Sam entering at the back of the chapel, taking a moment to appreciate what he's looking at: 20 or 30 people here in the church that he built. A dream realized. And he walks down the center aisle, shaking hands with a few people, climbing steps to the altar and switching on the microphone... 
SAM (to the band) Thank you, Tommy. You boys is soundin pretty good up here. 
Sam turning to the crowd, clearing his throat, clearly nervous. 
Sam pointing to the map. The Administrator turning to Deng -- 
ADMINISTRATOR (ARABIC) He should not be this far north. 
SAM What are you sayin? 
ADMINISTRATOR The villages in this area are very remote, Mr. Childers. There is nothing there. 
SAM Then it seems to me them people need help the most. 
ADMINISTRATOR (to Deng, Arabic) He will be killed. 
SAM Talk to me. 
The Administrator turning to him, laying it out simply -- 
ADMINISTRATOR This is in the war zone, Mr. Childers. The LRA will kill you here. 
SAM I don't think you understand me, so lemme make it real clear to ya. I didn't pick this land -- God did. 
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANGE - SUDAN - DAY - THREE MONTHS LATER 
What we're looking at is the modest beginning of The Angels of East Africa Children's Orphanage. A cluster of tukuls and 2 or 3 rudimentary wood buildings built on the dirt Sam first let trickle between his fingers. 
And we see life already finding it's place within these bamboo walls. Acholi WORKERS laying brick on what will eventually become a schoolhouse and chapel. 
And we find Sam with two or three small CHILDREN who are crying for no apparent reason. He's on his knees, trying his best to soothe them but he is way out of his depth here. 
And now we see Deng in the b.g. approaching with a powerfully built Ugandan woman in her late 40's. 
DENG (INTRODUCING) Sam... this is Betty. She is from the village of Kotido. A few miles from here. 
SAM Good to meet you Betty. 
Betty, no reaction. Just the incessant crying of the children in the b.g. 
DENG She is knowing that you need someone to run the orphanage. 
SAM I'm lookin for somebody who can keep the place in order. Make sure things is taken care of when I'm away. 
DENG She can do this. 
SAM She's gonna have to take care of the children too, make sure they're fed, fix em when they're sick. Can she do that? 
Betty hears this, turns to the crying children and softly says -- 
BETTY (ARABIC) Quiet now. 
-- and instantly their crying stops. 
SAM Tell her she's hired. 
INT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANGE - NIGHT 
We see Betty and another Camp Woman (ROSE) moving through this room carrying lanterns, helping the children get ready for sleep -- 
BETTY (ARABIC) You two share a blanket and tomorrow we will find another. 
ROSE (ARABIC) Shhhh, it's time to shut your eyes... 
And we see Sam here too, doing what he can, tucking in a few of the kids, starting to make a connection with these children. 
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
And we see a handful of SPLA soldiers stationed around the perimeter of the compound, standing guard. Sam and Deng sitting next to a lantern by the front gate. 
SAM You know what's funny? In English your name means "darn it." 
DENG What is this `darn it?' 
SAM Deng. It means `shucks.' You know, like you stub your toe and you go "ahhhhh, deng!" Get it? 
DENG (DEAD SERIOUS) This is not funny. In my language, in Arabic, names are very important. They tell you everything about a man. (BECOMING HEATED) Your name proceeds you wherever you go. You are Sam. This is how you are known. In my language this means something. 
Sam feeling terrible, realizes he's offended him. 
SAM I'm sorry, buddy. It was just a joke. 
Quiet, awkward, just the two of them sitting here quietly for a long beat. Finally... 
SAM (CONT'D) What does Sam mean in Arabic? 
DENG Small penis. 
And Deng smiles brightly. Sam realizing he's been played. And Deng starts to LAUGH. A deep, guttural, infectious laugh. Sam joining him, and we sense that at this moment these two have become friends. And gradually their laughter subsides, and it's quiet again. 
SAM Can I ask you a question? 
DENG Of course. 
SAM You believe in God? 
Deng considering this for a beat, and then... 
DENG I was raised to believe there was a God in heaven. (MORE) DENG (CONT'D) But it is impossible to live here, to see what I have seen, and not turn your back on him. 
BEAT. 
SAM Maybe you'll invite him in again one day. 
Betty and the other Camp woman herding the terrified children into this building -- the only brick structure on the compound -- and then Deng, Marco, A.J. and the other SPLA soldiers coming in -- moving to the window holes and returning fire -- 
EXT. FRONT GATE - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
Sam sweeping the AK back and forth, trying to hold off the rebels as long as he can -- and then -- 
KABOOOM!! 
More of the fence eviscerated by a grenade blast. 
REBELS ADVANCING ON THE ORPHANAGE -- BREACHING THE PERIMETER -- 
Sam becoming overwhelmed in the fight -- firing as he retreats back into the compound -- 
INT. CHAPEL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
-- Sam storming into the chapel -- turning to Betty -- 
SAM (meaning the children) Put em in the middle! 
Betty and the other woman do exactly that -- they move the children into a tight group in the center of the room. 
BETTY (ARABIC) Down here! -- in the center! -- all of you! -- stay down! 
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
Rebels moving through the compound, firing into tukuls and setting everything on fire. 
INT. CHAPEL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
Sam, Deng and the other soldiers returning fire -- 
DENG (ARABIC) Four on the right! 
NINETEEN (ARABIC) There are too many! 
SAM Just keep firin! 
Sam starting to open up with his AK -- Krakakakakakak! -- spent shells showering down around the children huddled in the middle of the room. 
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
Rebels swarming around the chapel, but reaching a point where they can't advance any further -- 
-- and we see a rebel squat behind a shed and screw an RPG into a launcher -- he pops up -- levels the launcher at the chapel and -- 
Krakakakakak! 
He's cut down before he's able to fire -- 
INT. CHAPEL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
-- Sam sweeping his AK across the compound -- the other soldiers burning through magazines and reloading -- rebels firing back -- Betty and the children crowded on the floor in the middle of this STORM OF GUNFIRE -- and we stay in this little chapel -- watching this last stand -- until we -- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - MORNING 
And we see the entire orphanage has been razed to the ground. Betty and a few of the children picking through the burned out buildings and torched tukuls, looking for anything salvageable. Deng, Nineteen, and some of the SPLA soldiers loading the corpses of rebels into the back of the truck... 
... and now we find Sam staring at the brick chapel in the middle of the compound. The only structure that remains. Everything else -- his entire dream -- in ashes. 
INT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT 
And we see Lynn pushing a shopping cart down the aisle, past shelves loaded with packaged produce. And we hear BUZZING. Lynn digging the cell phone out of her purse -- 
LYNN Hello? 
EXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, SUDAN - SAME (DAY) 
And we find Sam sitting at a table along this dusty, crowded street. His duffelbag on the ground next to him. 
SAM (INTO PHONE) It's me. 
INT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT 
Lynn immediately senses something wrong. 
LYNN You ok? 
EXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, SUDAN - SAME (DAY) 
And we see that he's not. This man is empty, alone, defeated. 
SAM They burned it to the ground. All of it. Ain't nuthin left. 
INT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT 
She hears the anguish in his voice. 
LYNN Where are you? 
EXT. STREET CAFE - NIMULE, SUDAN - DAY 
SAM Nimule... 
INT. GROCERY STORE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT 
SAM'S VOICE (O.S.) ... I'm comin home. 
-- DOORS BANGING OPEN! -- CONTROLLED CHAOS as the children are hauled into this clinic -- Betty taking care of Alice -- the worst off -- hooking her up to an IV as Sam moves to her bedside -- the little girl still mumbling quietly -- 
SAM What is she saying? 
BETTY She is asking what she did wrong? 
Sam taking Alice's hand in his... very slowly her beautiful eyes open and she sees him... and says something in Arabic... 
BETTY (CONT'D) (TRANSLATING) She is asking if you are `The Preacher.' 
SAM (NODDING) Tell her she's gonna be ok. 
Betty translates and Alice smiles faintly... and now one of the other camp women comes over and Sam steps back so they can work... 
EXT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DUSK 
Sam coming out of the infirmary and finding Deng here with a few of the SPLA soldiers who brought the children. 
SAM Where did they find em? 
DENG Their village was hit out Adjumani. 
Off Sam, hearing this, we... 
TIME DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANAGE - DAWN 
And we see Sam and Deng sitting outside the infirmary, exhausted, been here all night waiting. And now the door opens and Betty comes out. She looks down at them and simply shakes her head... 
And we know Alice is dead. 
And it looks like a grenade has gone off inside Sam. And suddenly he grabs an AK and gets up, seething, walks off... 
DENG Sam... 
EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - DAY 
... Sam walking fast through the compound... Deng following... 
DENG Where are you going? 
SAM Adjumani. 
DENG Sam, please wait... 
SAM I ain't waitin. You wanna see what waitin gets ya? Take a look in that buildin over there... 
Sam reaching the SUV and starting to gear up... 
FADE UP the plaintive wail of an Acholi WAR SONG... haunting... ethereal... and then a chorus of voices rising up... taking us to... 
INT. SUV - DRIVING - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY 
Bombing down this rutted, red dirt road. The engine at full tilt. Sam, Deng, Nineteen, Marco, and A.J. jammed into this truck riding in dead silence... AK47's bouncing between their knees... only the sound of the WAR SONG playing as we watch these men... a grave stillness on their faces... thinking of what men do just before their own death. 
EXT. DIRT ROAD - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAY 
We see two LRA VEHICLES approaching in the distance... a LEAD JEEP and a PICKUP TRUCK behind it... 
INT. LRA PICKUP TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY 
Four CHILD SOLDIERS squatting in the flatbed of this truck carrying AK47's. We recognize one of the boys as the younger brother from the opening scene -- WILLIAM. 
INT. LRA JEEP - DRIVING - DAY 
With two ADULT REBELS in this Jeep as they drive down this road past bombed-out vehicles... and in the distance we see the smoldering wreckage of a transport truck on the side of the road... the thick smoke hanging over the road like a black curtain... blocking out vision of the road ahead... 
... and the Jeep punches into the black smoke followed by the pickup truck... and we're lost in the swirling haze for a moment before coming out the other side... and this is what we see -- 
SAM -- standing in the middle of the road ahead of us shouldering a RPG -- the ADULT REBELS see him just as -- 
WHOOOOSH! -- an RPG streaks right at us and DETONATES -- KABOOOOM! -- and the Jeep flips onto it's side -- 
INT. PICKUP TRUCK - DAY 
THE PICKUP GRINDS TO A STOP! -- the driver slamming it into REVERSE - - accelerating back into the curtain of smoke -- trying to get the fuck out of there when -- 
BBrrraaaappp! 
.30 CALIBER MACHINEGUN STRAFE across the front hood -- 
EXT. SUV - SAME

EXT. LRA PICKUP TRUCK - DAY 
-- the pickup truck reversing out of the black smoke -- OUT OF CONTROL -- going off the road into a ditch -- WILLIAM and the other boys bailing out of the flatbed -- TWO ADULT REBELS piling out of the cab -- scrambling for cover behind the truck. 
EXT. BUSH - DAY 
Sam, Deng, A.J. and the others hustling through the smoke and finding cover. From Sam's vantage point he sees rebels hiding behind the disabled truck for cover -- shooting back -- a withering firefight -- the big .30 cal ROARING offscreen but the truck is protecting the rebels -- no clear shot -- 
EXT. LRA TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY 
William and the other child soldiers here with two ADULT REBELS -- crouched behind the truck for cover -- the ADULT REBELS returning fire, but the children aren't moving, scared shitless. 
William peers around the truck and sees Sam fifty yards away, turns to the boys next to him... 
And we see Sam on his cot when the light goes out. He leans over and torches a small Kerosene lamp next to him. 
INT. DORM - NIGHT 
The children on their mats in the dark now... quiet... a few of the younger ones whimpering, starting to cry... the darkness becoming too much... reminding them of past horrors... and then we hear a FAINT VOICE in this dark room... singing quietly... an ancient African lullaby... and then other little voices joining in... singing this song they all know... a song their mother's once sang to them... 
INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
... Sam hearing the soft chorus drift across the compound... somehow finding comfort in it too... blowing out the lamp and laying here in the dark... listening to the children sing. 
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - EARLY MORNING 
A SLOW DISSOLVE... life springing up in the camp... daylight breaking... a routine seen here... Betty, Rose and the other camp women arriving at the orphanage... cooking fires being lit... soldiers drinking cups of strong coffee, warming themselves after a long night... 
... and Sam coming out of his tukul carrying his duffle bag... discovering William curled up next to his door, sleeping on a mat in the dirt... been there all night. William stirring awake, seeing Sam above him and scrambling to his feet. 
SAM Mornin, buddy. 
William, no response. Just staring up at him. 
SAM (CONT'D) Ain't you gonna say nuthin? 
William, nothing. 
SAM (CONT'D) Ok then. 
And Sam walks across the compound followed by William a few paces behind... and he reaches Deng, Betty, Nineteen, and a few of the other volunteers waiting by the truck... 
DENG (MEANING WILLIAM) Looks like you've got yourself a bodyguard. 
SAM Guess I do. 
Sam tosses his bag into the back, says goodbye to everyone... 
SAM (CONT'D) Take care of things while I'm gone, ok? 
DENG I will, Preacher. 
They shake hands and Sam gets into the truck... and we see William already here, sitting in the backseat. 
SAM You can't come with me, buddy. 
DENG (to William, Arabic) Get out of there. 
But William isn't moving... 
DENG (CONT'D) (ARABIC) Come on! -- out! -- 
... and finally Deng reaches in and grabs him... tries to pull him out but he fights back... yelling as Deng drags him out of the truck... 
INT. TRUCK - DRIVING - DAY 
Sam turning around in his seat as we pull away from the compound... and he sees William still struggling in Deng's arms... and finally he breaks free and SPRINTS for the truck as it drives off... fast as he can... chasing Sam until he no longer can. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH/KITCHEN - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY 
And we see two teens moving toward the sound of a crowd coming from inside the church, responsive, "Hallelujah!"... and then Sam's voice over it all... 
SAM (O.S.) In your actions you give service to the Lord... 
INT. CHAPEL - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - CENTRAL CITY - SAME 
Sam at the pulpit in mid-sermon. There is an air of Fire and Brimstone to what we're watching here... electric... the congregation listening in rapt attention... 
SAM ... he's not interested in your good thoughts... your good intentions... he wants your hands... your backs... your sweat... your blood to pour into the foundation that will build up his kingdom! 
Ad-libbed SHOUTS and PRAISE... and now we see Lynn, Daisy, Donnie and Paige in the congregation listening... as we go -- 
INT. HALLWAY/FOYER - SHEKINAH FELLOWSHIP CHURCH - DAY 
Lynn and Sam walking through the facility, and we see this place is alive with activity. More than just a church, this is a community center. Lynn opening a door and we see a Volunteer here with a dozen little children running around this playroom... 
LYNN We started daycare last month. Monday thru Friday from 8 to 2... Sundays after first worship for a few hours if anybody needs it. How you doin, Sue? 
VOLUNTEER Good. Hey Pastor. 
SAM Sue. 
Lynn pulling the door closed and they continue... moving down a set of stairs to the basement where we see children and parents... some of them playing ping-pong and air hockey... others in a corner rehearsing for a Christmas play... 
SAM (CONT'D) Been thinkin we need to put up a playground. Swings. Some things the kids can climb on. 
LYNN We can't build anymore. Not for awhile. 
SAM You said Sundays has been full. 
LYNN Turn outs been good, but that don't mean people is givin money. (MORE) LYNN (CONT'D) Economy is in trouble, construction business is slow. Times is tight. 
SAM Be good for them kids, Lynn. 
LYNN They got the playground over in Cairnbrook. And they can play at the school on weekends if they want 
Sam turning to her -- 
SAM Not talking bout here. Talkin about the orphange. 
Lynn catching up to him now, realizing his head is still back in Africa. 
DOOR BELL RINGING -- and we see a perky woman in her late 40's coming through the crowd, blonde hair from a bottle, accessorized to the hilt, holding a glass of white wine. SHANNON WALLACE. She opens the door to find Sam, Lynn, and Paige standing in the doorway. 
SHANNON Well, come on in... 
And they enter... Lynn smiling awkwardly, dressed in the same yellow dress we saw her in previously... her only dress... and Sam looking around this enormous room... 
SHANNON (CONT'D) Ya'll must be the Childers. Welcome. I'm Shannon, Bill's ball-n-chain. 
Smiling, a joke she loves... 
LYNN I'm Lynn, this here is Sam, our daughter Paige. 
SHANNON Good to meet you. 
VOICE (O.S.) There he is! 
Everybody turning to see the car dealer coming through the crowd, smiling, a little drunk. AD-LIBBED introductions and then... 
BILL Glad ya'll could make it. Get on in here and meet some people... 
Bill ushering them deeper into the house... quick intros to a few guests as they pass... Sam, Lynn, and Paige taking it all in... starting to sense the dimensions of this massive house... the waiters in their pressed jackets offering them food... the extravagance... like nothing they've ever seen... 
... Bill pulling Sam off from the crowd so it's just the two of them... taking an envelope from his jacket and handing it to him... 
BILL (CONT'D) This is a little somethin for the kids, ok? What we were talking about. 
SAM Thank you, Bill. 
BILL Forget it. Now c'mon, can I get ya a mojito or somethin? 
INT. BATHROOM - SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY 
Sam coming into this bathroom and locking the door... taking the envelope out of his pocket and tearing it open... pulling out a personal check -- CLOSE UP to see it's in the amount of $150 
HOLD ON Sam face, and it's disgust we see in his eyes. 
EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY 
Front door opening fast and Lynn and Paige coming out, followed by Sam, pushing them along... 
LYNN Sam... 
PAIGE Why we leavin so soon? 
Shannon appearing in the doorway in the b.g., calling after... 
SHANNON Everything alright?... 
Lynn turning to respond, but Sam keeps her moving forward, down the driveway, past the line of parked BMW's and Mercedes to their truck at the curb... 
SAM Get in the car. 
LYNN What's wrong? 
As they load into the truck... 
SAM Sonuvabitch is cryin pour-mouth to me and he's livin in the damn Taj Mahal... 
LYNN Sam... 
SAM I asked him for five-thousand dollars to feed a buncha motherless babies and you know what he gave me? (taking out the check, wadding it up) Hundred and fifty bucks. That's it. Handed it to me like it was gold bouillon! Sonuvabitch spent more than that on salsa for his party. 
INT. CHILDERS HOUSE - DAY 
-- Sam coming into the house, enraged, followed by Lynn. He moves to his gun cabinet, grabs a hidden key, unlocks it... 
LYNN What are you doin? 
SAM I've had it with these people and all their bullshit about wantin to help... 
And he starts pulling out weapons... shotguns and assault rifles... stuffing them into an oversize gun bag... 
LYNN Sam Childers... 
Lynn reaching for him and he grabs her wrist... tightly... staring at her with dark eyes. A flash of the "old" Sam Childers here when he says... 
SAM Stay outta my way. 
And for the first time in years this woman is scared. He lets go of her wrist and continues to fill the bag -- and we go -- 
EXT. PAWN SHOP - JOHNSTOWN, PENNSYLVANIA - DAY 
Sam coming out followed by the Shop Owner... 
SHOP OWNER ... I'm sorry, twenty-five hundred is the best I can do for them gun. 
REVERSE to see Lynn's car parked at the curb, Sam pointing to it... 
SAM Throw in the car for five. 
The Shop Owner considering, as we go... 
EXT. ROAD - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY 
Windy, pissing rain. And we see Sam walking up this rural road, hands in his pockets, head down... the only human for miles... trudging through this shitstorm completely alone. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY 
DONNIE Ok. 
PAIGE Dad usually kisses me on the forehead before he leaves. You can do that. 
DONNIE Sure I can. 
And Donnie does just that, bends down and kisses Paige on the head... 
DONNIE (CONT'D) Sweet dreams. 
And now we see Lynn in the hallway having just witnessed this through the cracked door, keenly feeling Sam absence in this moment. 
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY 
And we see Sam, Betty and Rose leading a group of children, their hands covering their eyes so they can't see, into a clearing behind one of the dorms. 
SAM Keep em closed! A little bit more! 
BETTY (ARABIC) Keep your eyes closed. 
ROSE (stern, Arabic) Michael! Cover your eyes! No peeking! 
SAM ... keep comin'... 
The children inching forward, following his voice, until... 
SAM (CONT'D) Ok, stop! Open your eyes! 
BETTY (ARABIC) Open your eyes! 
And we see a hundred little eyes popping open, staring at something off screen, confused for a split second at what they're looking at. 
REVERSE to see a PLAYGROUND: two or three battered swingsets, a few see-saws, and a jungle gym soldered out of metal pipe. 
And the kids SPRINTING for it, climbing all over the jungle gym like ants... hitting the swing-sets... and then we hear it... something we realize we haven't heard in this place before... the sound of laughter... children losing themselves in play. Innocence flooding back. 
And now we see Nineteen, A.J. and two other SPLA soldiers standing around a BUNNY BOUNCER... staring at it quizzically... talking in Arabic, trying to decide what this thing is... and then A.J., the bravest, slings his AK onto his back and carefully straddles the bouncer... pulling up his long legs and resting his feet on the pegs... 
And he begins to bob back and forth... holding onto the bunny's ears with his big hands... the other soldiers starting to laugh as he bobs faster... and then we see A.J's smile... a million watt smile on this guy... the first time he's played like this since he was a boy. 
EXT. DORM - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER 
Hours later and we see Sam pushing a couple of the smaller children on the swingset. Deng approaches... 
DENG Some of the child soldiers say there is a bounty on your life. That Kony is offering money for your nose and ears. 
Sam, no reaction, just keeps swinging the children... 
DENG (CONT'D) I'd like to assign a few more men to you during the day. 
SAM He ain't the first old-boy who wanted to see my head hanging on his wall. Keep yer soldiers where they're needed. I can take care of myself. 
Deng clearly worried for his friend, but doesn't press the issue. And now Sam notices William off from the group, sitting on the ground by himself, not playing. 
SAM (CONT'D) He said anything yet? 
DENG All we know is that his family was killed and that he and his brother were taken into the LRA. 
SAM Where's the brother? 
DENG Nobody knows. 
NEW ANGLE 
Sam approaching William, kneeling down next to him. 
SAM Hey buddy, you don't wanna play with the other kids? 
William, no response. 
SAM (CONT'D) You know sometimes it helps to tell somebody what you got locked up inside, know what I mean? 
William, no reaction whatsoever. Something dawning on Sam in this moment... 
SAM (CONT'D) You have no idea what I'm sayin, do you? 
William just stares back at him and Sam realizes he doesn't speak English. And they both just sit here for a moment, silent, staring at the children playing on the playground. And then Sam, feeling the need to unburden himself, begins to talk... 
SAM (CONT'D) I done a lotta things I ain't proud of. Hurt a lotta people. Truth is, helpin you kids is about the only good thing I ever done in this life. 
William watching him quietly. 
SAM (CONT'D) But I'm scared. Scared one day I'll close my eyes to all this and make it somebody else's problem. (BEAT) Just like everybody else in this world. 
And he stops and it's silent between them again. William just sitting there quietly. And Sam looks up to the sky... feeling his life washing over him... his burden... this fear. 
INT. SUV - DRIVING - DAY 
Sam behind the wheel, driving alone the edge of a dry ravine. Deng is in the passenger seat and we see Nineteen, Marco and A.J. crammed into the back. 
SAM I don't see nuthin. 
Deng checking a handheld GPS unit -- 
DENG This is it. 
Sam looking out the window, sees movement at the bottom of the ravine. 
SAM Hold on... 
Deng looking through binocs at the ridge -- 
DENG (calling out to Sam) I think you got him! 
EXT. RIVERBED - DAY 
Sam, Deng, and Marco moving toward the children, weapons drawn, scanning the area in all directions. Deng is the first one to reach the boys who are huddled on the ground, shaking from fear... 
DENG (ARABIC) It is ok. You can get up now. 
But the boys don't move... and Deng reaches down, pulls them to their feet and we see that their ankles are chained to a post which has been buried in the ground. 
DENG (CONT'D) Sam. 
Sam joins Deng, sees the chains. 
DENG (CONT'D) LRA wanted us here. 
Sam realizing that these children were used as bait -- for him. 
EXT. RAVINE RIDGE - DAY 
We're at the top of the ravine now and we see Sam and the others moving toward the location of the SNIPER... 
... and Sam is the first to reach the body... laying on the ground face down... a pool of blood soaking the dirt underneath... and he rolls the body onto it's back and we see it's just a kid -- no older than 15 years old. 
INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
It's late at night and we see Sam on his cot, sitting here in the dark. And we hear the sound of his satellite phone vibrating on the table next to him. He picks it up, sees DONNIE'S name on the screen... 
SAM (INTO PHONE) Hello? 
INT. UNKNOWN LOCATION - PENNSYLVANIA - DAY 
And we see Donnie on a couch by himself in this shitty little room. 
DONNIE Sam, it's me. 
INTERCUT THE CONVERSATION: 
SAM Everybody ok? 
DONNIE Oh yeah, everybody's just fine. I was just callin to say `hey' is all. 
SAM How're the girls? 
DONNIE They're good. Paige cooked us all dinner the other night. Chocolate-chip pancakes. 
SAM By herself, huh? 
DONNIE Yep. I helped her with the stove is all. She did everything else. Pretty good too. 
And now we see Donnie's DOPE WORKS sitting on the table in front of him. He's using again. 
DONNIE (CONT'D) How's it goin over there? 
SAM Goin fine. 
DONNIE Hey, maybe I'll come with you one of these trips. I'd like to get outta here for a spell. See what it's like. 
SAM Sounds good. 
And it's silent between them... both of these men lost in their own worries for a moment... and then... 
DONNIE Ask you a question? 
SAM'S VOICE Yeah. 
DONNIE'S VOICE You think God will forgive us for the things we've done? 
And we're watching Sam, this question hitting him like a freight train. Unable to answer. 
EXT. NIMULE - SUDAN, AFRICA - DAY - DAYS LATER 
We're hit by a crush of people, a thousand black faces moving past us and all the noise and confusion of this busy border town. And we find Sam, Deng, and Nineteen here loading supplies into the back of the SUV. 
VOICE (O.S.) They talk about you... 
Sam turning to find Agnete, the aid worker, approaching him. 
AGNETE In the camps. The children. They say there is a white preacher who hunts the LRA. This place does not need more killing, Mr. Childers. 
SAM I'm just tryin to help these people. Same as you. 
AGNETE War upon war does not fix what is broken here. The history of this country is filled with righteous killers. That is how it always begins, with men thinking they are killing for the right reasons. 
SAM I got a 200 kids who are gonna sleep safe tonight and wake up tomorrow mornin to a bowl of hot food. Right or not, that's all the reason I need. 
AGNETE And what about the rumors I have heard about you supplying weapons to the SPLA? 
Sam turning to her, face-to-face, starting to get pissed... 
SAM You fight the evil in this place your way, I'll fight it mine. 
AGNETE Do not delude yourself, Mr. Childers. You're a mercenary, not a humanitarian. 
Sam, finished with this conversation, slams the lift-gate closed on the truck and starts to climb in... 
AGNETE (CONT'D) They say you are doing good. That you have special powers. That you are protected by angels and cannot be killed by bullets. 
EXT. TARMAC - KAMPALA AIRPORT - DAY 
The helicopter lifting off the ground, ascending into the cloudless sky until it's just a speck in the limitless blue... 
SAM (V.O.) And only then will their hearts beat no more... and they will be turned to dust. 
INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY - (JULY/2005) 
Paige and her girlfriend from her 7th grade class sit on the landing. Donnie flips through a magazine, Lynn puts away laundry. Chatter here about an upcoming formal... 
PAIGE Mary Strauss and them is havin dinner at The Chimney. 
LYNN Who's her date? 
PAIGE'S FRIEND Tony Wilks. 
LYNN I thought Tony Wilkes was goin with Patty Hobbes' daughter. 
PAIGE They broke up last month. 
And now we see Sam off from the group, absently watching the TV in an adjoining room... and a NEWS REPORT begins... a PICTURE OF JOHN GARANG flashing on the screen... Sam moving closer to the set so he can hear -- 
TV NEWSCASTER ... Sudanese opposition leader John Garang has been killed in a helicopter crash according to a statement released by the Sudanese Government in Khartoum today. 
Sam going completely still... 
TV NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) Garang was hailed as a peacemaker in Sudan and was instrumental in ending the 21-year civil war that has ravaged that country. 
ARCHIVAL SHOTS OF GARANG. 
TV NEWSCASTER (CONT'D) Six of Garang's associates and seven others also died in the crash which is being blamed on bad weather. 
Sam frozen, shocked... just staring at the TV as the newscast switches to another story... 
PAIGE (O.S.) Dad? -- Dad? 
Sam looking up to find everybody staring at him. 
PAIGE (CONT'D) What do you think about us gettin a limo for next weekend? Wouldn't be too expensive since there'd be six of us. 
Sam lost here for a moment... 
PAIGE (CONT'D) Hel-lo? Earth to Dad? What do you think? 
LYNN Honey, you ok? 
DONNIE Heck, why don't I just drive ya'll? 
PAIGE We ain't crammin in the back of your Caprice. 
DONNIE Ya'll could fit in there easy. 
PAIGE We got dresses, Donnie! We'll get all wrinkled! Plus it smells in there. 
DONNIE I can get some freshener, Paige, that ain't no problem. 
PAIGE Dad, what you think? Can we get a limo? 
SAM No. 
PAIGE Dad. Please. Patty and them is gettin one. 
SAM You ain't rentin no limo to Pittsburgh. 
LYNN We could probably get us a deal through one of Tom Hickey's boys. Between the six of them it wouldn't cost too much. 
SAM Nobody's spendin money on no friggin limousine. 
PAIGE But dad... 
Sam snapping, FLASHING WITH RAGE -- 
SAM WHAT THE HELL DID I JUST SAY?! 
Quiet. Nobody moving. Completely still. And then... 
LYNN We're just talkin bout it, honey... 
SAM Too much talk in this house. I got mouths to feed and you're talkin bout pissing money away on a limo. 
PAIGE It's my formal, dad. 
SAM I don't give a shit what it is! You ain't gettin no limo, end of story. 
Tears welling up in Paige's eyes, anger, hurt, wanting to lash out at him somehow. And what she says next she's felt her whole life... 
PAIGE You love them black babies more than you love me. 
SAM WATCH YER MOUTH LITTLE GIRL, BEFORE I SLAP IT! 
LYNN Sam... 
Donnie instinctively grabbing his arm, protective... 
DONNIE Hey... 
And Sam spins -- gets in his face -- eyes dark and threatening -- 
SAM What the hell you think you're doin, boy? 
DONNIE'S CORPSE lying in a casket... 
Packed with mourners. And we hear a CHILDREN'S CHOIR singing a plaintive hymnal... "My Jesus, I love thee"... and Donnie's mother in the first pew, dressed in black, surrounded by a few other women offering her comfort. 
And now we see Sam moving up the steps to the platform... and the choir softly finishes... and he looks out over the congregation... not saying a word for a long beat... and then... 
SAM Most of you want me to stand up here and make some sense outta this. That's why you come here today. You want me to tell you that God has his plan for all of us, and when he wants to call us back home he's gonna do it. (BEAT) That's what you wanna hear... (QUIETLY) That's what you wanna hear... 
And Sam stops, unable to continue... just stares out at the congregation... at the expectant faces looking back at him, waiting... 
... but he steps away from the lectern, down the steps, and walks up the aisle toward the exit... the congregation staring at him as he passes... 
INT. LYNN'S CAR #2/CHILDERS DRIVEWAY - DRIVING - DAY 
Hours later. Lynn and Paige still dressed from the funeral, driving up the driveway to their house. 
PAIGE Mom, who are those men? 
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD we see a FLATBED TRUCK parked next to the house and 7 or 8 MOVERS pulling heavy machinery out of the barn. 
EXT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY 
Lynn getting out of the car, approaching some of the men... 
LYNN S'cuse me, what are you doing? 
MOVER Loadin up... 
And she makes her way into... 
INT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY 
Filled with movers busily hauling equipment out of the garage. Lynn coming in, confused... 
LYNN Hey, s'cuse me... 
And now she sees Sam going through a cabinet in the back. 
LYNN (CONT'D) Sam, what's goin on? What are these men doin here?... 
Sam slamming the cabinet closed, moving past her without saying a word. Lynn grabbing his arm, stopping him. 
LYNN (CONT'D) Where are they taking our stuff? 
SAM Ain't ours no more. Best go through and make sure they ain't takin nuthin that belongs in the house. 
He walks off... 
LYNN Sam... 
And she sees two men start to dismantle the "Childers Construction Company" sign that she painted herself years ago -- 
LYNN (CONT'D) Hey! -- Don't touch that! -- 
EXT. GARAGE - CHILDERS HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - DAY 
Sam moving toward the house. Lynn comes out of the barn after him... 
LYNN (CALLING AFTER) Sam! 
But he's not stopping. He reaches the house... 
INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE - DAY 
... Sam coming inside, moving to the kitchen... Lynn following him. 
LYNN Honey, I know you're hurtin. I know you're angry, but we need to talk about this... 
SAM It's all done, so save yer breath... where's the keys to the safe? 
Sam grabs papers from the counter and hands them to Lynn. She quickly pages through them, can't believe what she's reading. 
LYNN You sold the business for $27,000? 
SAM I need a new truck for the orphanage. 
LYNN A new truck? You sold our business for a new truck? 
Sam finds the Keys. 
LYNN (CONT'D) That was our future, Sam. Paige's future. 
Lynn follows Sam into the office. 
LYNN (CONT'D) Everything we have has gone to those children, Sam. There's a point when there ain't no more to give. 
SAM What's the combination? What's the fucking combination. 
LYNN Paige's birthday. 
Sam starts to spin the combination but hesitates... 
LYNN (CONT'D) You don't know it, do you? You don't even remember your own daughter's birthday. 
SAM What are the numbers? 
LYNN You fight for everyone but us. 
She moves past him, spinning the combination and cranking open the vault. Sam grabbing a couple stacks of cash. 
BOOOOM! 
He's dead. Just like that. And he continues walking up the bridge. And we see Agnete, Deng and the other soldiers having just witnessed this. 
INT. INFIRMARY - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
William coming in quietly, moving next to one of the captured Rebels from the previous scene who is shackled to a bed, injured. Two SPLA soldiers here standing guard. 
WILLIAM (ARABIC) I want to ask you something... 
William pulls out the photograph of his brother, holds it up... 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) This is my brother. His name is Christopher. He was stolen by the rebels. (BEAT) Do you know if he is alive? 
The Rebel looks at the photograph but says nothing, just shakes his head... and he looks off, his thousand yard stare inscrutable... 
And William simply folds the photograph back up and slips it into his pocket... but he doesn't leave... he sits here a moment longer... quietly... thinking... and then... 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) Were you taken when you were young like me? 
The Rebel hears this and turns to him... and nods his head... 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) Do you remember your parents? 
And we see something happening in this hardened rebel... his eyes filling with a distant memory... a sadness... and slowly he nods his head again. 
And we stay here with these two lost souls sitting next to each other... silent... connected by a shared history and anguish. 
EXT. CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - DAY - LATER 
Sam sitting alone, lost to the world around him. Deng approaches. Neither one acknowledging the other for a long beat until... 
DENG Do you hear that, Preacher? 
SAM What? 
DENG There is no more laughter. The children do not play here anymore. They are scared once again. (BEAT) But now they are scared of you. 
Sam, no response. 
DENG (CONT'D) The men do not trust you any longer to lead them into battle. They say you have a wish to die. (BEAT) I am worried about my friend. I want to help him. 
SAM I don't need your help. 
And Sam turns away. After a beat Deng walks off, leaving him alone once again. 
INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
And we see Sam here in the dark... moonlight filtering in through the thatched roof... like shards of glass cutting through the blackness... and he doesn't look right here... soul worn thin... eyes hollow... starting to go someplace very bad... 
... IMAGES FLASHING IN HIS HEAD... babies burned and screaming... Donnie in his coffin... and we realize we're watching something here... his world starting to cave in on him... 
... and he drops against his cot... distraught... tears in his eyes and this man is breaking... and suddenly we see a gun in his hand... finger curling around the trigger as he puts it to his head... eyes closing against the world... and... 
WE HEAR A KNOCK AT HIS DOOR 
Sam frozen... still holding the gun... and slowly the door pushes open and we hear soft footsteps shuffling into this dark room... 
... and William steps into the light, sees Sam here on the ground with the gun in his hand... and slowly he moves next to him, sitting on the cot without saying a word... just the two of them here for a moment... and then slowly he begins in perfect English... 
WILLIAM I remember my parents when I sleep. I see them in my dreams sometimes. 
Sam looking to William... this small boy sitting above him... telling his story... 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) My father was big like you. They shot him. We were so scared. Then the rebels gave me a club and told me if I didn't kill my mother they would shoot my brother and me. 
And William pauses in his story... lost in this memory... his face becoming a mask of pain... but no tears... there are no more tears in this young man left to be shed... and so he continues... 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) I refused, but my mother told me to swing hard... that I must make her proud... (BEAT) And so I did. I made her proud. 
And now William looks down at Sam... staring at this man on the ground... and he reaches out and gently touches Sam's head... a moment of tenderness for both of them... an act of love.... these two broken souls finding each another here... and William says... 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) If we allow ourselves to become full of hate then they've won. We must not let them take our hearts. This is the most important thing. 
And Sam sets the gun down and reaches out to William, pulls him into an embrace... holding him close... and we know that without a doubt this boy has saved this man's life. 
INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY- CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT 
Soft Christian music is playing on the radio. Lynn folding clothes in the laundry room when the phone rings. Paige comes into the upstairs hallway and answers it. 
PAIGE (quiet, into phone) Hello? 
INT. SAM'S TUKUL - CHILDREN'S ORPHANAGE - NIGHT 
Sam on his sat phone -- 
SAM Bug? You there? 
INT. CHILDERS' HOUSE - CENTRAL CITY, PENN. - NIGHT 
PAIGE Dad? 
SAM Yeah, it's me. 
PAIGE You ok? 
SAM I'm ok, Bug. 
And there's a long pause... so much to say but no words to say it... each of them holding their phones to their ears and just listening... and finally Sam says... 
Deng coming up to Sam... 
DENG Some of the soldiers said he was asking about the commander that is being held at Kismoro. 
Sam closing his eyes, knows instantly what William has done. 
SAM Get em on the phone, see if he's shown up at the base yet. 
EXT. LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - NIGHT 
William shoved through the bush... moving deeper into this rebel encampment... dark and otherworldly... figures moving around camp fires... laughing... men with little girls... their child wives... with pregnant bellies... and incongruously the sound of American rap music coming from a jambox somewhere. 
The overriding sense we get from this place is one of `insanity.' 
And William is dragged to a clearing next to a grouping of tents and he's kicked to the dirt... two other soldiers pinning him to the ground as a third grabs his feet and pulls off his shoes... William YELLING and now a handful of other LRA soldiers start to gather around... most of them only a few years older than him... watching as his ankles are bound together and placed on a wooden block... 
... and now another soldier steps forward with an AXE... and the crowd whips into bloodlust... shouting... cheering... 
AND THE SOLDIER LIFTS THE AXE INTO THE AIR -- 
WILLIAM WRITHING ON THE GROUND BUT CAN'T GET FREE -- 
AND THE SOLDIER STARTS TO BRING THE BLADE DOWN -- AND -- 
VOICE (O.S.) (ARABIC) Stop! 
The soldier freezes -- everyone turning as an LRA COMMANDER comes through the crowd -- takes the axe from the soldier -- 
SOLDIER He ran from us. 
COMMANDER He is worth nothing with no feet. Put him with the others until tomorrow. 
EXT. COMPOUND - CHILDREN'S VILLAGE ORPHANGE - NIGHT 
Deng hustling up to Sam... shaking his head... 
DENG They have not see the boy. 
SAM Ok. Get Nineteen and Marco -- we're gonna go look for him. 
EXT. LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - NIGHT 
And we see William in a bamboo cell in the center of camp... and we see other children here... in various stages of fear and suffering... some of them completely naked... shivering in the cool air... others catatonic, probably doped up or too battered to move. 
INT. SUV - DRIVING - NIGHT 
Sam, Deng, Nineteen and Marco in this lead truck... been out here for hours... behind them we see the second camp truck following... 
And they come to a fork in the road, pulling to a stop. 
DENG It will be light soon. What do you want to do? 
Sam looking at a topo map on his lap... 
SAM Let's go through Maridi, see if they've seen anything. 
EXT. LRA CAMP - DEEP IN THE BUSH - DAWN 
Pale yellow sun breaking and we see William and a line of 10 or 12 other children -- shackled in iron -- being loaded into the back of a TRANSPORT TRUCK. 
INT. SUV - DAWN 
Both SUV's parked off the side of the road now. Sam and Deng here, looking at maps and the GPS tracker. And we hear Deng's radio squawk. He digs it out, responds in Arabic, then turns to Sam... 
DENG The village outside of Akot says an LRA caravan came through there an hour ago. They were headed for Ed Duim. 
INT./EXT. - LRA CONVOY/BUSH - DEEP IN SUDAN - DAY 
A convoy of 4 or 5 LRA trucks barreling down this dirt track. And we see lots of rebels standing up in the back of these trucks, cradling heavy weapons, alert -- and suddenly we see in the distance -- 
TWO ROOSTER-TAILS OF DUST COMING AT US 
From different angles -- converging on the LRA convoy -- the Rebels see them and point -- they know what's coming and they begin to prepare for war -- 
THE ROOSTER-TAILS 
Getting closer -- and then we see them -- 
SAM'S TWO TRUCKS 
Bouncing over the terrain towards us -- coming fast -- and then -- 
WOOOOSH! 
An RPG streaks toward the lead LRA truck and -- KABOOOM! -- the truck is blown off it's axles -- the other LRA trucks pulling off the road -- and suddenly we're in a withering firefight -- the roar of heavy weapons at full-tilt. 
SAM AND HIS MEN 
Jumping out of their trucks and flanking the LRA convoy -- triangulating fire -- shredding the rebels -- blowing them back off their feet. 
NINETEEN 
Sprinting through the bush -- edging around the LRA trucks -- finding a position on their weak side and locking an RPG into a launcher -- shouldering it -- aiming -- WOOOOSH! -- the missile streaking toward the second LRA jeep and -- 
KABOOOM! 
It's blasted into the air -- onto it's side -- rebels scurrying away from the wreckage -- still firing -- an absolute hail of lead -- AK's barking in every direction -- 
KRATAKRATAKRATAKRATAKRAKKK!

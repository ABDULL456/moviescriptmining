FADE IN: 
INT.  SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
Blinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit in the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES, a 50-year-old civilian.  This is his confirmation hearing. Reading from prepared material: 
HAYES ... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on -- 
DEHAVEN Whoa, whoa, whoa.  "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that... 
At the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to ponder the ceiling of the hearing room.  Her plaque card reads "CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE." DeHaven is a tough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60. In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades -- and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim. 
DEHAVEN Would that be anything like "typing"?  "Restocking the cupboards"?  That sort of thing, Mr. Hayes? 
CHUCKLES from the packed gallery.  The flag officers go stone-faced.  Hayes forces a smile. 
HAYES Hardly the case, Senator. 
DEHAVEN Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type.  I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military.  Case in point... 
On cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members of the dais.  Hayes gets a copy, too.  And it jars him. 
DEHAVEN "The Lark Report." 
HAYES Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy.  I must seriously question whether -- 
DEHAVEN (to others on panel) The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier.  Female aviator, it just so happens. (to Hayes) You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right? 
HAYES I was one member of the investigating commission. 
DEHAVEN Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's.  And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm? 
HAYES I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of -- 
DEHAVEN I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes. 
A humorless smile.  She's roasting his nuts over an open fire, and everyone knows it. 
HAYES The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier. 
DEHAVEN That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior. (closing report) In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this.  Never.  I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes.  Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
Heading for her office, DeHaven is escorted by a small PRESS RETINUE. 
DEHAVEN ... a full 35 percent of all jobs in the U.S. military are still, to this day, off-limits to women.  And that's simply gotta change. 
PRESS #1 What about those who say women aren't suited for all jobs?  That they're physically weaker... they have less stamina... 
DEHAVEN Sure.  And we're gonna hog the bathroom, too. 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE catches up, pulls her aside. 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE White House boys want a private meeting. 
DEHAVEN I'll act surprised. 
INT.  DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
Shoes dumped on her desk, DeHaven changes out knee-high stockings while devoting one ear to... 
WHITE HOUSE #1 ... to reassure you that he has every faith in the ability of Mr. Hayes to guide the Navy into the next century.  The task, as the Administration sees it, is to acknowledge changing realities without losing traditional values. 
A beat.  DeHaven looks between the two WHITE HOUSE boys -- #1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier. 
DEHAVEN 'Zat it?  Ten minutes, nothin' on the table?  Sweetcakes, you best go back to the President and tell him to open up the phone book and start lookin' for his next nominee. 
White House #1 looks spanked.  Taking over, #2 pops a briefcase.  An inch-think report appears before DeHaven. 
INTERCUTTING: 
ROYCE Halfway 'round the world.  So that's the problem -- we can get the team in, just not out. 
JORDAN (an inspired beat) Unless you Whiskey Run. 
ROYCE Blank faces here, O'Neil. 
JORDAN Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles.  All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride.  Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan:  Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub.  But don't waste time opening and closing hatches.  They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters. 
A dubious beat. 
ROYCE You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back?  Is that correct, O'Neil? 
JORDAN Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir.  Why not? 
Silence on the radio:  They're discussing her scenario privately.  During, Jordan's kayak reaches the junction of the Potomac and the Anacostia rivers.  On the far bank lies... 
Naval Intel Center (N.I.C.), bristling with communication antennae. 
Jordan stares at the complex, waiting for a response. 
ROYCE All right, sending the recommendation across the river. Royce out. 
The phone goes dead. 
JORDAN No, thank you, sir. 
EXT.  SECURITY STATION - N.I.C. - DAY 
Bundled in topcoat and scarves, military and civilian employees transit a security station on their way inside. Presently Jordan appears -- wearing a wetsuit and balancing a collapsed kayak on her head.  She flashes a photo-badge and double-times inside. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY 
Jordan exits a locker room.  Smoothing out her Khaki uniform, she heads down a broad corridor with cipher-lock doors.  Falling in step: 
ROYCE That was good headwork, lieutenant. 
JORDAN Thank you, sir.  We hear back from the Pentagon? 
ROYCE (scoffing) Probably hear back from CNN first. 
JORDAN Hate this part.  Just sweating it out on the sidelines. 
ROYCE Intel has its own glory, lieutenant -- no matter how subtle. 
Now they reach... 
INT.  BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY 
A circular chamber.  Dominating the ground floor is the bullpen, a hive of cubicles an computer stations.  On the second floor are executive offices, ringing the bullpen. 
ROYCE By the way, I'll need that option paper by 11-hundred today so I can review it with Admiral Hanover.  And do we have any of that breakfast tea around here? 
JORDAN (with a look) Is this my glory, sir? 
On the upper walkway, a frazzled N.I.C. SECRETARY appears.  She spots Royce and Jordan below. 
N.I.C. SECRETARY Excuse me, but I have Senator DeHaven on the line for you. 
ROYCE Jesus God, what now? 
He bounds up the stairs toward his office. 
N.I.C. SECRETARY I'm sorry, sir no -- she asked to speak with Lieutenant O'Neil. 
Royce turns back and gives Jordan a hall-of-fame look. "Oh, really?" 
INT.  DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
DEHAVEN (into phone) So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Thank you, ma'am.  Um, may I ask what this is regarding? 
DEHAVEN (reading file) High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia.  Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote. 
INT.  BULLPEN - N.I.C. - DAY 
On the phone, Jordan glances around.  Co-workers mull within earshot.  Those out of earshot post E-mail memos on Jordan's computer:  "Moving up in life."  "I want a full report."  "Don't tell her who you really voted for." 
SLUTNIK Half a night, Lord, just gimme half a night to set her straight... 
Jordan tries another table.  This one, too, becomes abruptly full.  As Jordan leaves, HOLD on Miller.  He's a human eclipse -- six-three, 220, the perfect commando physique.  Instructors wish they could clone him. 
MILLER Average woman is 25 percent body fat.  That's one-quarter fat, man. Think about that. 
MCCOOL Nice distribution, though. 
MILLER No way does she makes this program. No way. 
After wandering the mess hall like a homeless person, Jordan finds refuge at a table with female mess stewards. They look at her with blank faces.  No understanding.  No compassion. 
EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
Jordan walks in a bathrobe, toweling her hair dry.  She fishes for keys at her door. 
VOICE It's not so much that they hate you... 
Jordan looks.  Someone is sitting on an outdoor table, smoking.  He leans into the light so she can see his face. It's Wickwire, the mid-30s lieutenant who doubles as class officer.  He's dangerously handsome. 
WICKWIRE They're more afraid of you. 
JORDAN Well, now I feel so much better. 
WICKWIRE It was made clear before you came -- harassment equals career suicide. Can't say anything good, so they don't say much at all.  To your face, anyway. 
JORDAN Whose orders were those? 
WICKWIRE It was made clear. (getting up) Anyway, stay ballsy.  First week's hell, then it levels out.  Until S.E.R.E. training, anyway.  That's hell-and-a-half. 
JORDAN And how do you know that? 
WICKWIRE Made it to Week 10 last time. 
JORDAN I didn't know they let you try again.  Especially at your age. 
WICKWIRE You're kind of a surprise yourself. 
A faint grin from Wickwire before he shadows back across the courtyard that separates the two B.O.Q. buildings. Back across no-man's land. 
INT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
Two beds.  Matching lockers.  A desk, a chair, a mirror. All overwhelmingly dull. 
Jordan drops the robe off her shoulders to take inventory of her body.  Both sides of her neck are bruised from the phone-pole run.  Her back and thighs are sand-burned. Mirror cuts abound.  She's already a mess. 
Jordan uncaps some cologne.  It's a vestige of her old life she's not going to surrender.  She sniffs.  Savors. Dabs.  Looks back in the mirror... 
And breaks out laughing.  It's like dropping a rose in a cesspool. 
EXT.  SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - CORONADO - DAY 
A PHOTOGRAPHER stands near a car parked just outside the base.  He's peering through a 600mm lens. 
PHOTOGRAPHER'S POV:  FOCUSING through cyclone fencing... PANNING past the sand dunes... and finding green-clad trainees gathered at an obstacle course. 
EXT.  OBSTACLE COURSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
An explosion of sand:  England and Wickwire belly-flop into a sand pit and speed-crawl under barbed wire.  Clear, they gain their feet and blitz toward... 
The rolling logs.  They balance-beam their way to... 
The rope climb.  Racing to the top, they reach a platform and fling themselves down onto... 
The high poles.  They land awkwardly, losing their wind and their grip, tumbling into the sand pit below before... 
Racing for the finish.  The Chief thumbs a stopwatch. 
THE CHIEF England, 88 seconds.  You're good to go for the slide-for-life. Wickwire, roll back till you get south of 90. 
WICKWIRE Fuck.  Yes sir. 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO Who'd you kiss to get back in here, anyway? 
Wickwire dusts off and starts back for... 
The starting line.  Stepping up next is Cortez, the human fighting cock.  Jordan lines up beside him and psyches up for the first obstacle -- and eight-foot sheer wall. 
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS Hang on, here... 
The outdoor table.  No visitors tonight. 
INT.  JORDAN'S B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
Jordan pushes inside -- and stops when she sees the little two-step platform.  That awful crutch.  Someone has put it beside her bed. 
Jordan wheels around to check... 
EXT.  B.O.Q. - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
The men' building.  Slutnik and a few others loiter on a balcony, mirroring her stare. 
EXT.  CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
Hastily dressed, Jordan marches across the base.  Her march turns into an angry run as she cuts through parking lots... jumps hedges... and finally reaches... 
EXT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
An on-base bungalow.  Jordan bangs on the front door until the C.O.'S scowling face appears. 
JORDAN Pardon the hour, sir.  But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way. 
C.O. Didn't take long. 
He waves her inside. 
INT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
C.O. All right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, I'll have the X.O. file an action first thing in the morning. (waits) A name? 
JORDAN It's you, sir.  And it started the day I came here. 
C.O. (jolted) Oh, really. 
JORDAN It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment.  It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met. 
C.O. Because I was civil, now you're complaining. 
JORDAN I can't afford civility, sir.  How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider?  Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..."  I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base? 
C.O. Did you just have a brain-fart? 
JORDAN Pardon? 
C.O. Did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander?  If so, I regard that as a bonafide brain- fart, and I resent it when people fart inside my home. 
JORDAN I think you've resented me from the start, sir. 
Now, finally, her opponent steps into the ring.  And he's a bare-knuckle brawler. 
C.O. (building) What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment.  What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears. (drawing close) But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities.  DOES IT? 
JORDAN No, sir. 
C.O. No, sir, WHAT? 
JORDAN The shape doesn't bother me.  It's just that goddamn rotten stench. 
A dangerous beat -- before the C.O. disengages. 
C.O. Well.  'Least now we're talking the same language. (a beat) So one standard.  Is that what you're after? 
JORDAN Same rules for everyone, sir. 
C.O. Straight up? 
JORDAN Across the board, sir. 
C.O. And if you just happen to wash out, I won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy-chested female Senator?  And please note I did not identify any one in particular. 
JORDAN Wouldn't dream of it, sir. 
A deciding beat. 
C.O. Then good night. 
JORDAN So I'll get a fair shot? 
C.O. You'll get everything you want, O'Neil.  Let's see if you want what you're gonna get. 
JORDAN Come on, Montgomery... 
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS Flea!  O'Neil!  Why is there a break in that line? 
Finally Jordan grabs Flea by the neck, pushes him ahead and mounts him.  The class closes down into a long human snake. 
JORDAN (in his ear) Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"? 
FLEA It's really "F. Lee Montgomery" -- but that gets whittled down to just "Flea."  For short, ma'am. 
JORDAN So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size? 
FLEA No, ma'am. 
JORDAN Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me.  But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway.  It's just gonna hurt us both, okay? 
FLEA I'll work on it, ma'am. 
JORDAN Do that. 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO (to the Chief) Time. 
THE CHIEF Check your watch, Pyro.  Seems fast. 
CAMERA POLLS the grim, blue-lipped faces in the water. Jordan feels Flea starting to shake.  Badly. 
JORDAN Hey.  You okay, Flea? 
FLEA 'Snot me.  It's him. 
Two bodies ahead, it's the big bruiser, Miller, who's shuddering.  Jordan feels him shaking through Flea. 
MILLER Jesus, my hands... they aren't workin' right... 
NEWBERRY How long i'zis for? 
WICKWIRE 'Sposed to be 20-minute intervals, no more. 
NEWBERRY Swear each time's gettin' longer. 
MCCOOL This where you bailed last time, Wick? 
WICKWIRE Huh-uh -- but wasn't middla February last time, either. 
FLEA How you doin', Miller?  Miller? 
No answer.  Bad sign.  On shore: 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO 22 minutes... 
Ignoring, the Chief lifts his bullhorn: 
THE CHIEF Remember, all this is completely voluntary.  For any of you who don't want to continue, Instructor Johns is now serving coffee and danish at the ambulance. 
A portable light comes on.  Indeed, an instructor is setting up coffee service. 
THE CHIEF Any takers? 
SLUTNIK He's the fuckin' Antichrist. 
MCCOOL Wick!  They really got donuts over there?  Or just some'a last night's dinner rolls? 
FLEA Look like donuts to me... 
JORDAN (in disbelief) What're you guys doing?  Huh? 
MCCOOL Just askin' 
JORDAN What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist?  How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they -- 
Suddenly the line rips apart.  It's Miller, breaking for shore. 
CLASS NO! 
Soon the dyke is bursting everywhere:  Four others break rank, following Miller's lead. 
The deserters stagger onto the beach.  MEDICS close in quick, draping them with blankets, shining flashlights in their faces, asking brain-check question. 
MEDICS Tell me what day this is... look at me now... what city are you from, sailor... here, look right here... 
ENGLAND He talked too much? 
MCCOOL "Negroes can't see at night.  Bad night vision." 
JORDAN You're kiddin' me. 
Jordan jumps in the hole, ready to take over shoveling. 
MCCOOL See, you just the new nigger on the block, O'Neil.  That's all.  And maybe you moved in too early. 
He climbs out.  HOLD on Jordan, looking off down the dunes, seeing the other crews covering up and going underground for the night.  How the hell did she wind up here?  So far from home? 
EXT.  SILVER STRAND HIGHWAY - DAY 
A Jeep speeds along the public highway, carrying the C.O. back to base.  When the Jeep tops a rise: 
C.O. What in God's name... 
Ahead, a half-dozen news crews are camped on the shoulder. All cameras are trained on the base. 
INT.  BEDROOM - GEORGETOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT 
CAMERA FINDS Navy dress blues laid out on a bed... topcoat draped on a chair-back... CNN on a television. 
CNN COMMENTATOR (TV) ... is denying that it is considering changing its long-held policy of exclusion -- but it isn't denying the presence of at least one female in a heretofore all-male program.  Dubbed "G.I. Jane" by the media, this woman is now undergoing commando training at the Special Warfare Command Center in San Diego... 
Half-shaven, Royce leans out of the bathroom in time to catch... 
Footage from Coronado:  A woman in Navy greens is on a beach run, loaded down with backpack and M-16.  The NEWS FOOTAGE ZOOMS IN, FREEZE FRAMES with the indelible image that will be used over and over in coming weeks:  Woman cradling rifle.  Madonna for the 21st century. 
ROYCE Goddamn.  My poster girl. 
CNN COMMENTATOR (TV) Senator DeHaven's office still has not released the identity of the woman, but DeHaven is confirming that "G.I. Jane" has outlasted many of her male counter-parts in the program, said to be one of the most grueling anywhere.  Joining us now on "Washington Tonight" for the feminist perspective is Gloria Allred, live from -- 
Royce snaps it off.  He can't take anymore. 
INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT 
Beneath the coffered ceiling of a great Beau-Art hall, one of Washington's power-tribes is celebrating.  We find gowned women, tuxedoed men, gold-braided naval officers, a SWING BAND, and... 
Secretary Hayes, newly confirmed.  He beams as he dances with his wife.  Compliments and friendly barbs come from all directions: 
COMPLIMENTS (O.S.) Congratulations, Mr. Secretary.  Say hello to the President for me... Maybe now you can change that carpet in your office, Teddy... So what was the deal you made with DeHaven?  Or was it the Devil?  Always get them confused... 
HAYES Didn't you hear?  Effective immediately, all navy vessels can no longer be referred to as "she." 
BRAYS of laughter. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BEAU-ART HALL - WASHINGTON D.C. - NIGHT 
Royce, EXCUSING his way through the crowd, fixating on the bar, leading his DIAL-A-DATE winner by the hand. Conversations drift into earshot: 
VOICE #1 ... women are child-bearers.  Life- givers.  Now we're going to make them killers? 
VOICE #2 ... just don't have the upper-body strength... 
VOICE #3 How strong do you need to be to launch a rocket?  To push a button or pull a trigger? 
Royce can't get away from it. 
DIAL-A-DATE Are we going to dance? 
ROYCE Not right now. 
Just yards from the bar, a Pentagon E-RINGER snags Royce's elbow. 
E-RINGER Commander Royce.  How's life across the river? 
ROYCE Little slow, sir.  When's the Pentagon going to send me a good crisis? 
E-RINGER I'll check my out-basket in the morning.  Say, do you know... 
The E-Ringer turns to make introductions -- but finds his CIRCLE OF FRIENDS embroiled in the topic du jour: 
CIRCLE #1 ... but men have trained as athletes for 5,000 years.  Women have been at it for, what, couple of decades?  Do we really know the limits of their strength? 
CIRCLE #2 Or their endurance?  You know, 30 years ago, women marathoners were 90 minutes off the pace of the men. Now, the women's time is probably only 20 minutes off. 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
Jordan resurfaces.  Treading water, she scans for... 
Seafox.  It makes a hard turn in the water and starts back.  The recovery rig -- a big flexible loop -- is lowered into position. 
Still hauling ass, Seafox picks up the trainees in reverse order -- England, Slutnik, Cortez.  They each stab an arm through the passing loop... 
EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY 
... and vault back aboard, slick as hell. 
CORTEZ Hoo-yah!  Better'n sex in a car crash! 
But now they're bearing down fast on... 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
Jordan.  She braces as best she can.  As SEAFOX THUNDERS past, she stabs for the loop... 
And snags it with her hand.  But only her hand. 
Hanging on grimly, Jordan drags face down in torrential water.  Her mouth gropes for clean air but can't find it. If she doesn't let go soon, she'll drown. 
EXT.  SEAFOX - OCEAN - DAY 
At the stern, the Chief spots Jordan bobbing up in the boat's wake. 
THE CHIEF (to pilot) Next recovery!  Keep goin', keep goin'! 
EXT.  OCEAN - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
COUGHING up water, Jordan watches Seafox speed on toward McCool and Flea.  They make textbook recoveries.  She's the only one who couldn't cut it. 
INT.  WOMEN'S SHOWERS - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
Head hung, Jordan showers alone. 
THE CHIEF (O.S.) You know, the Israelis... 
Jordan recoils.  Christ, how long has he been there?  Just standing in the doorway? 
THE CHIEF ... they tried women in the 1967 War.  Female soldiers. 
With forced calm, Jordan squeaks off the water and finds a towel. 
JORDAN Permission to get dressed, sir? 
THE CHIEF It seems the men couldn't get used to the sight of women blown open and their viscera hanging from tree limbs.  Israeli men would linger over wounded females -- often to the detriment of the mission, often endangering their own lives.  They don't use women anymore. 
JORDAN (moving closer) Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross.  May I ask what you got it for? 
THE CHIEF For pulling a 210-pound man out of a burning barrack in Saudi Arabia. 
JORDAN I see.  So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft. 
THE CHIEF Could you have pulled that 210-pound man clear, lieutenant? 
She can't say yes.  She wants to but can't. 
THE CHIEF Females in combat situations impact unit cohesion.  Men fight better without women around.  And that is an historical fact. 
JORDAN It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir.  So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead. 
She shoulders past.  The Chief gives her a few steps before dropping his bomb: 
THE CHIEF England went out with a stress fracture.  That puts you in charge, lieutenant. 
JORDAN (off-balance) McCool's that same rank.  We're both j.g.'s. 
THE CHIEF You were commissioned one month earlier, which makes you the senior officer. (passing her on his way out) Remember.  There are no bad crews -- only bad leaders. 
INT.  ARTILLERY RANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
Trainees are getting familiar with M-60 machine guns, firing SHORT BURST at downfield targets. 
CORTEZ (pissed) No operational experience, and now she's callin' the shots? Unbelievable. 
SLUTNIK Suppose she'll wanna eat with us now... 
JORDAN So why are you telling me this? 
ROYCE Big symbols make big targets, Jordan.  I think someone's gunning for you. 
JORDAN You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too. 
ROYCE I'm only trying to warn you in case -- 
JORDAN Well, let me warm you:  I'm going though with this.  The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish.  So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay? 
ROYCE That's not what I want, Jordan.  I mean... it is and it isn't... 
JORDAN Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce. 
ROYCE Jordan.  You watch your ass. 
JORDAN Sure.  I'll join the crowd. 
EXT.  AIR STATION - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
A HELO WARMS UP on its pad. 
Crew Six approaches, garbed in black wetsuits, loaded down with weapons and rucksacks.  Jordan is at the lead. 
INT.  HELO - NIGHT 
The helo is airborne.  Sitting on rucksacks, trainees slather their faces with green camouflage paint.  Over the HOWLING ROTORS: 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO Infiltrate... establish your hide- site... record any movement of troops, vehicles, patrols -- any activity inside your scan.  If you are compromised, you have two options!  Newberry! 
Newberry is the new sixth man.  He's young enough to still have a hyperactive Adam's apple. 
NEWBERRY Evasive maneuvers or radio for emergency extraction, sir! 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO If you are extracting, be damn sure to follow procedures you have learned in your classroom training! A helo cannot extract you from a wooded area!  You must bring it down in a clearing!  What's the minimum clearance for an MH-60 Black Hawk, McCool? 
MCCOOL 32 feet, six inches, sir! 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO You will be penalized for early extraction, but you will be penalized more for capture -- trust me, far more!  Survival!  Evasion! Rescue!  Evacuation!  Welcome to S.E.R.E.! 
EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT 
The helo swoops low over the water, moon silhouetting. Black figures helo-cast into the ocean. 
INT.  HELO - NIGHT 
Last out, Jordan is poised to follow when... 
INSTRUCTOR PYRO Lieutenant!  Don't back down! 
Jordan looks back.  "What the hell does that mean?" Offering no elaboration, Pyro signals "GO!"  Jordan springs clear... 
EXT.  OCEAN - NIGHT 
... and knifes into black water. 
The HELO PATTERS away. 
An inky stillness overtakes the world. 
Jordan activates a red-light beacon, sweeps it around, revealing her position to... 
Her crew.  Five black faces regroup around her. 
SLUTNIK Feel right at home, McCool? 
They secure weapons atop their waterproof rucksacks. Jordan checks a heat-bearing compass. 
JORDAN (nodding direction) South-southeast.  And I don't want to hear another word till we're underground. 
Pushing rucksacks ahead of them, they start swimming towards... 
A moonlit shoreline.  Half-mile ahead. 
EXT.  ROCKY SHORELINE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - NIGHT 
Jordan's crew reaches shallow water.  They deflate their vests and rucksacks.  Jordan trades her face mask for night-vision goggles. 
NIGHT-VISION POV:  Sweeping the rocks.  Nothing at first. Then two "hostiles" appear, patrolling the rocks. 
McCool takes a second look. 
SCOPE POV:  Of the women drawing closer... closer... and finally looking dead-bang at us.  She does an about-face and walks away.  Quickly. 
MCCOOL Shit.  Think we're had. 
CORTEZ Smoke her. 
MCCOOL I ain't gonna shoot her. 
CORTEZ Only blanks.  Lemme do it. 
MCCOOL (pushing him away) Hey.  Ain't your call, man. 
He looks to Jordan. 
JORDAN Pri One is to protect the mission. If she represents a real threat, we have to do it. 
Pleased, Cortez slips his rifle under a roof panel. 
JORDAN (to McCool) But did she see us?  Do you know for a fact that we are compromised? 
McCool doesn't.  Not for sure. 
JORDAN If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area.  Now how smart is that? 
MCCOOL (a beat) Mighta been civilian. 
NEWBERRY They got regular peeps on this island, don't they? 
EXT.  ROAD - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY 
The asphalt road shimmers with midday heat.  Suddenly a TROOP CARRIER ROARS over a rise. 
INT.  HIDE-SITE - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY 
SCOPE POV:  Of the troop carrier braking hard.  "Hostiles" spill out the rear -- and fan out all around us. 
CORTEZ (at scope) Banditos on the east perimeter!  150 yards!  Shit, she was part of it! 
MCCOOL Fuck me. 
FLEA What's the word, el-tee?  We're about one minute from a major take- down here. 
HOLD on Jordan, heart skipping.  Did she really make the wrong call? 
JORDAN All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site.  Ready? 
SLUTNIK Sure.  Now she wants to shoot. 
JORDAN MOVE! 
EXT.  SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY 
They come out of the hide-site like atomic locusts, splintering into three groups and laying down SUPPRESSIVE FIRE as they blitz for... 
The woodlands. 
"Hostiles" FIRE and pursue. 
Flea is running flat out when the ground vanishes beneath him.  He goes down like a doped race horse.  Suddenly exposed, another crew scrambles into daylight:  Flea ran right over their hide-site. 
Slutnik yanks Flea out, gets him back on his feet. 
EXT.  WOODS - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY 
Breathing like asthmatics, Jordan's crew regroups at the link-up site just inside the woods.  Flea comes in hobbling.  Badly. 
SLUTNIK This ain't workin' right! 
MCCOOL What's our go-to-shit plan, O'Neil? 
SLUTNIK This ain't even workin' wrong! 
A beat as Jordan deliberates.  She doesn't want to go out like this. 
FLEA Really don't wanna be captured, el- tee.  Heard some bad things. 
JORDAN Fuck. (snatching the radio) Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix... 
As "hostiles" pull Flea out of the pen. 
INT.  BOX - P.O.W. CAMP - NIGHT 
A BANGING wakes Jordan.  Are they coming for her?  But FOOTSTEPS LEAVE.  A GROAN from the adjacent box. 
JORDAN Who is it? 
WICKWIRE (O.S.) (a beat) You know, I had an apartment about this size once. 
JORDAN Wick.  They got your crew, too? 
WICKWIRE (O.S.) Intagliata was out chasing breakfast.  They found his tracks. Well, shit. 
A beat. 
JORDAN You really came back for more?  Of this? 
WICKWIRE (O.S.) When I was sittin' behind a desk in Washington, it made sense, somehow. Blame it on my big brother.  He was Spec-Recon.  And the stories he used to tell... 
JORDAN If you got a good one, Wick... 
Anything to get her mind off this box.  Out of this box. Now INTERCUT Jordan and Wickwire, lying like fraternal twins in their wombs of steel: 
WICKWIRE One time he was doing a rekkie of the Libyan coastline.  This is, like, right before we bombed Khadaffi into the past tense.  So his crew does a nighttime infil, maps all the big artillery placements and stuff, then turns around to get the hell gone.  But between them and the water are five Libyan guards, all armed to the nuts. 
JORDAN They had to kill 'em? 
WICKWIRE Nah, they were dead-ass asleep.  But on every guard's chest,they left one Marlboro cigarette.  Just a little calling card to say they'd been there -- and could come back any time they wanted. 
JORDAN That's a good story. 
WICKWIRE So the shit you gotta go through? To get from here to there?  Brother said it was worth it.  Worth the training... worth the divorce... worth anything. 
JORDAN He was married? 
WICKWIRE At first. 
JORDAN You got anybody, Wick? 
WICKWIRE Not me.  You? 
It hurts to think about it.  The Potomac.  The gunkhole harbor.  Royce. 
WICKWIRE O'Neil? 
JORDAN How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part? 
WICKWIRE (a beat) Last time I didn't. 
JORDAN (jarred) Let's keep talkin', Wick.  Just keep talkin' to me... 
EXT.  NEWSSTAND - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY 
Royce stops for a newspaper.  As he pays, something else catches his eye.  He picks up... 
A "People" magazine.  The grainy image of "G.I. Jane" fills the cover.  A photo inset, much clearer, shows a beaming DeHaven.  "BEHIND EVERY GREAT WOMAN..." 
ROYCE (shaking head) Suitable for framing... 
INT.  CORRIDOR - N.I.C. - DAY 
ROYCE Got time for a brain-pick? 
Reading as he walks, a former CIA spook looks up to find Royce in lockstep.  It surprises him:  Not many people here talk to him -- unless they're in trouble.  THE SPOOK is physically unremarkable except for a face that would be right at home on Easter Island:  This is a man who's seen most of the world's ills -- and forgotten none. 
THE SPOOK Subject? 
ROYCE O'Neil, Jordan. 
THE SPOOK Thought you two were file-closed. 
ROYCE You knew about us? 
THE SPOOK Sorry.  Thought you knew I knew. 
INT.  SITUATION ROOM - N.I.C. - DAY 
Royce and the Spook enter.  The vault-like door closes emphatically.  Ensuring their privacy: 
THE CHIEF You are in the cage, O'Neil.  Right here, right now. 
JORDAN Should I be afraid? 
THE CHIEF Right down to your worthless womb, and I'll tell you why.  This is my island.  My world.  And here I can get away with shit that would get me arrested anywhere else in the world. Take another scan of my little joy- boy outside.  If I can do that to a Navy Seal, what's gonna happen to you?  Huh? 
It makes Jordan think -- and yes, it makes her afraid. Continuing the psychological strip-search: 
THE CHIEF Why didn't you shoot the woman, O'Neil? 
JORDAN Wasn't deemed a threat. 
THE CHIEF She led us right to you.  That's no threat? 
Jordan rubs her head.  So long ago.  How did the call come down? 
THE CHIEF Would you have shot if it was a man? 
JORDAN No.  Yes.  I mean, depends on -- 
THE CHIEF The others already told me, O'Neil. They wanted to shoot, but you wouldn't let them.  Because you went soft on another women -- 
JORDAN That's not right. 
THE CHIEF That's what your crew said.  Are they lying?  Or are you? 
JORDAN I think you're the liar. 
THE CHIEF I'm not the one who got five good men thrown in a bamboo cage.  You wear the bars, you made the call, and you got your whole crew -- 
JORDAN We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position. 
THE CHIEF You think we should go easy on women, O'Neil? 
She stares a beat, knowing it's a loaded question. 
THE CHIEF Do you? 
JORDAN No. 
THE CHIEF I'm so glad we agree. 
With stunning ferocity, he grabs her by the neck, pushes her out the door... 
EXT.  P.O.W. CAMP - SAN CLEMENTE ISLAND - DAY 
... and throws her onto a table. 
In the pens, all faces turn to watch.  Even instructors stop what they're doing as... 
The Chief pushes Jordan's head down and jams up behind her. 
THE CHIEF Didn't you know you'd be raped if you were captured?  Didn't you even think about that? 
JORDAN Sure.  Just like your men do. 
THE CHIEF I think we oughtta practice it, just so you know what to expect. 
He flips her over, rips off her belt, starts tearing open her pants. 
JORDAN Should I practice bleeding, too, sir?  Would that make me a better soldier? 
He covers her mouth -- her whole face -- with one hand. 
THE CHIEF (to the men) Any of you can stop this!  Just give me the location of one more hide- site, and it ends right here! 
In the pen: 
SLUTNIK (wide-eyed) Someone's trippin' out here... 
The Chief jerks Jordan up, whirls her around like a dead dance partner, slams her face-first into the pen to give the guys a good look at what's happening to that pretty face. 
THE CHIEF Three crews are still on this island somewhere.  Who knows where? 
The men trade itchy looks.  Some do know. 
JORDAN Don't do it, don't do it... 
The Chief throws her down like garbage. 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.) Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws. 
The phone suddenly weights a ton, DeHaven dumps it on the seat beside her.  HOLD on her disbelieving face. 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.) You there?  Senator? 
INT.  CORRIDOR - PENTAGON - DAY 
Hand-carrying a report, Flag Officer #1 hurries down a corridor, pushes through a door.  HOLD on the door marker: "Secretary of the Navy." 
INT.  SECNAV OFFICE - PENTAGON - DAY 
HAYES Without telling us they do this? With absolutely no lead time? 
At his desk, Hayes scans the report with a deepening frown. 
FLAG OFFICER #1 (to Hayes) Mr. Secretary, if this bill passes... 
FLAG OFFICER #2 Forget our three-year plan.  They're rushing the cadence.  We'll be forced to reorganize the Navy from top to bottom -- overnight. 
HAYES What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder? 
FLAG OFFICER #1 I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly. 
HAYES "G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh? 
The flags squirm.  Shaking his head, Hayes moves to a window that offers a stunning view of Arlington National Cemetery. 
HAYES 20 years in the Pentagon, I finally rate an office with a window -- and it looks out over the world's largest graveyard.  Think it's a sign? 
EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
The bell.  It reflects the moon.  TILT DOWN to reveal a new batch of helmets -- the casualties of S.E.R.E.  A graveyard of its own. 
EXT.  THE EXCHANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
Jordan exits with purchases.  Her face is still bruised from S.E.R.E.  With a minute to kill, she peruses a bulletin board casually.  But a RAISED VOICE leads her eyes to... 
Wickwire.  At a phone kiosk, he hangs up emphatically.  He looks flustered when he spots Jordan. 
JORDAN Sorry, didn't mean to -- 
WICKWIRE That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why. 
JORDAN First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire. 
WICKWIRE Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you? 
JORDAN (touching bruises) I can't go out.  Not like this. 
WICKWIRE I think you look beautiful. 
JORDAN Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides... 
Catching up, Blondell exits the exchange. 
BLONDELL Sorry.  Forgot I needed oregano and... 
She sees Wickwire.  An awkward beat for them all. 
JORDAN Do you, uh, know... 
WICKWIRE Sure, sure. 
JORDAN We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special. 
WICKWIRE Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask. 
Jordan and Blondell head for the parking lot.  HOLD on Wickwire, looking after them.  Thinking it through. 
INT.  CLASSROOM - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
Charts are being passed around the room.  Every trainee takes one, including Jordan. 
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS ... underwater detonation devices employ mechanical timers, and as such, they are subject to variances due to water temperature.  That's why when clearing mines, we always use two timers.  The charts now being passed out contain calculations you must memorize before... 
A MILITARY COP fills the classroom doorway.  Frowning, Johns joins the cop for a private discussion. 
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS O'Neil? 
She passes them robotically.  Flea realizes where she's going. 
FLEA Oh, no... no, no, no, no... 
They lurch after her, grabbing her, stepping in her way. 
THE CHIEF Stand fast! 
McCool and Flea jerk to a stop:  The Chief has emerged from the instructor's office.  Helpless, they watch as... 
Jordan mounts the stairs to the bell... takes up the baton... and HITS THE BELL like a tyko drummer. 
RING ONE:  On the pained faces of her crewmates. 
RING TWO:  On the Chief.  Taking no joy in it.  Just accepting it as inevitable. 
EXT.  THE QUARTERDECK - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
RING THREE:  On Wickwire as he walks across the base.  His regrets are obvious. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
EXT.  UPRIVER - THE POTOMAC - DAY 
The ice floes are gone.  The river banks are budding green.  Soon CAMERA FINDS a power boat making its way upriver.  A lone figure sits on the prow. 
EXT.  POWER BOAT - DAY 
It's Jordan.  Dressed in civvies, gunnysack between her legs, she's back in Virginia with nothing more than what she left with.  Around a river bend appears... 
The gunkhole harbor.  Home. 
EXT.  GUNKHOLE HARBOR - POTOMAC - DAY 
The boat docks.  Jordan springs clear, waves a worn-out thanks, starts up the dock.  But now she comes to a stop, seeing... 
Royce.  Stepping out of the house. 
EXTREMELY WIDE:  River shimmering behind them, they meet on the dock.  A charged stand-off:  Where do they pick up? Can they pick up?  Then Jordan drops her gunnysack and steps into his wide-spread arms.  Royce wraps her up as if to never let go. 
For the first time in this whole ordeal, Jordan begins crying, sobbing uncontrollably. 
ROYCE (in her ear) I want to kill them... I want to kill the guys who made you cry like this... 
INT.  COVERED PORCH - JORDAN'S HOUSE - SUNSET 
An hour later.  Sharing a quiet moment, Jordan and Royce cradle tea mugs while sitting on the rear porch that overlooks the Potomac and a fiery sunset. 
JORDAN All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay. 
ROYCE And this class officer... "Wickwire."  You think he was just trying to get even?  Striking back for... 
JORDAN Maybe.  Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it.  Almost like... (a beat) Did I say he was class officer? 
ROYCE Almost like someone put him up to it.  Okay, who? 
JORDAN No shortage of suspects. 
ROYCE The Chief?  Or maybe even Turrentine?  Your C.O.? 
She looks at him sidelong. 
JORDAN Royce.  Tell me you didn't keep a file on me. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - JORDAN'S HOUSE - DAY 
CLOSE on multiple files being pulled out of a briefcase. One contains clippings -- "G.I. Jane" photos, editorials, political cartoons.  Another holds records of Coronado personnel -- Jordan's crewmates, instructors, the base brass. 
ROYCE Somebody was yankin' your stings, Jordan -- maybe from 3,000 miles away.  I wanted to know who.  I still do. 
She shakes her head, resisting. 
ROYCE C'mon, Jordan.  Do the headwork with me. 
JORDAN It's done with, Royce.  Let it go. 
ROYCE Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back? 
EXT.  CAPITOL BLDG. - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY 
The real Capitol dome.  A flag is being raised over the Senate Wing. 
EXT.  CAPITOL BDLG.  - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY 
A car parks at barricades.  Jordan and Royce emerge, both in uniforms. 
D.C. COP Don't even dream about leaving that vehicle there. 
ROYCE Government car -- tow it if you want.  Just point us to DeHaven's office first. 
Not waiting for directions, Jordan takes the Capitol steps two at a time.  We've seen this look on her face before -- and last time, she nearly knocked the grinder bell into orbit. 
INT.  CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
Jordan and Royce move quickly down a corridor, eyes hunting, passing CAPITOL GUIDES and their tourists.  Soon they find... 
DeHaven's office.  A Navy captain exits with paperwork. Hasty salutes. 
ROYCE Capt'n. 
NAVY CAPTAIN Commander. 
The captain moves on.  Royce holds in the doorway a beat, memory nagging him.  Again he looks at... 
The captain.  He has a distinct bald spot. 
ROYCE (to Jordan) Get started here.  I'll catch up. 
Picking up where he left off a few weeks ago, Royce follows Bald Spot around a corner... 
INT.  PRIVATE STAIRCASE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
... down a private staircase... 
INT.  ANOTHER CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
... and through a door marked "Naval Appropriation Liaison Office."  It's not 30 seconds from DeHaven's door. 
INT.  FOYER - DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
SECRETARY Your name again? 
JORDAN Lieutenant j.g. O'Neil. 
In a side office, DeHaven's aide overhears.  He rises quickly and enters the foyer. 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE Ms. O'Neil.  Yes, of course.  I'm Douglas Champeau.  Unfortunately, the Senator is in chamber right now. How can I help you? 
JORDAN What chamber?  Which way is that? 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE I mean, she's on the floor of the Senate. 
JORDAN Okay, which way? 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE She really can't be disturbed.  But if you care to wait, I'll find you an office with a phone.  It might be several hours, but -- 
A TOURIST pokes in. 
TOURIST 'Scuse me, but I'm here to pick up gallery tickets?  Are you... 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE See the secretary, please. 
Over the aide's shoulder, Jordan watches as... 
The tourist claims tickets.  HOLD on the bureau near the secretary's desk where the tickets are stored. 
INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
On the chamber floor, SENATORS mull about, consulting aides, polling party mates.  PAGES place microphones and fill the ceremonial snuff boxes, readying the room for session.  Among the activity, we find... 
DeHaven.  Caucusing with another Democrat. 
JORDAN (O.S.) Senator DeHaven... 
DeHaven looks behind her.  Nobody. 
JORDAN DeHaven... 
DEHAVEN Just hold the goddamn clock, Walter. 
Not happy about it, the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove, grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions. He enters the chamber... 
INT.  SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
... and moves behind the rostrum.  Holding the broom by the bristles, the doorkeeper stands on tip-toes... 
And uses the broom handle to turn back the Senate clock by three minutes. 
Senators GROAN.  It's an old trick played by senior members -- and they all hate it when it happens to them. 
INT.  CLOAK ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY 
DEHAVEN I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that.  Come work for me.  I can always use a hard-charger on my team. 
JORDAN You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too? 
DEHAVEN I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began.  And that's quite verifiable. 
JORDAN I'm sure it is. 
DEHAVEN You'll think about my offer? 
JORDAN You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it.  If I spoke with him. 
DEHAVEN Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off.  No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige. (dangerously low) Don't play politics with me, little darlin'.  You'd be up way past your bedtime. 
DOORKEEPER (distraught) Madam Senator, please... 
DEHAVEN I'll call you in a few days. 
She flashes a winning smile and turns away.  As the chamber doors start to close behind her: 
JORDAN So I wonder what the President would think. 
The last image we have of DeHaven is her whirling back, startled.  The DOORS BOOM CLOSED in her face. 
EXT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
Through a window, we see the C.O. with a phone pressed to his ear.  He stands at attention even though wearing a bathrobe.  Half-audible through the glass: 
C.O. Yes sir.  No, I'm not saying it would be impossible, sir, just... Yes sir.  No sir.  Yes sir.  I can appreciate that, sir.  Good night, sir. 
INT.  C.O.'S HOUSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
The C.O. hangs up and looks to Jordan, heretofore unseen. She waits anxiously. 
C.O. Well, if you had to go over my head, lieutenant, that's the way to do it.  Christ, nothin' like a 0-200 call from the Commander and Chief to get the bowels movin'. 
JORDAN Sir?  What did he say? 
C.O. Basically -- he asked me if I could unring a bell. 
EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
START on the helmet graveyard.  Hands enter FRAME to reclaim one helmet in particular.  TILT UP on Jordan, back in the grinder, back in Navy greens. 
The Spec-Recon class is here.  Crewmates gawk like stone idiots as Jordan takes her old place in the line-up. 
C.O. (to class) One of you here understands better than anyone what this is all about. Someone who has engaged in conduct unbecoming.  Someone who knows, I would hope, what he must now do. 
CLOSE on Wickwire.  Feeling the heat.  Wondering if they really know who it is.  Now the C.O. parks himself right in Wickwire's face. 
C.O. And unless that someone takes the honorable way out in the next 10 seconds -- I will make certain he faces action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. 
Wickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell.  He slows when reaching Jordan, considering an apology he knows would be inadequate. 
JORDAN Just walk away and never stop. 
He does.  As Wickwire RINGS OUT: 
C.O. It seems we have an opening for class officer.  Any nominations? 
Eyes swing to Jordan.  Way ahead of them: 
C.O. All those in favor? 
A CHORUS OF AYES.  Jordan puddles up. 
PILOT Holy... LET'S GYRATE! 
As the pilot wrestles controls, the co-pilot rigs for auto-gyration.  But the bank they started is working against them:  The helo is coming down badly, circling like a huge steel feather. 
Braced, the Chief looks out the side door -- and sees ocean rushing up at him.  Fast. 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
MCCOOL What the shit is... 
Jordan whirls.  She's just in time to witness... 
The helo hitting the water.  In seconds it's gone. 
A stunned beat.  We never knew the ocean could be this quiet.  When the anesthetic of shock wears off: 
SLUTNIK You don't suppose this is just part of... 
JORDAN FLEA!  KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it!  Cortez?  What the hell you waiting for? 
Cortez torques his wrench hard:  CO2 flows into the ILB, inflating it.  The crew scrambles aboard.  Jordan digs like a dog to find a radio. 
JORDAN Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  We have a downed helo 12 miles west- south west of base with three aboard.  Repeat, we have a downed helo with three aboard... 
Slutnik yanks a starter cord:  Their outboard MOTOR ROARS to life.  The boat does a donut in the water and blasts away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
The ILB powers over swells.  Flea is perched on the bow, nose to the wind like a hunting dog. 
FLEA CUT IT!  CUT IT HERE! 
Slutnik motors down. 
FLEA Close as I can get, el-tee! 
JORDAN Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water.  Go, GO! 
They grab masks and mini-tanks and dive in like dolphins. Jordan snaps up the radio. 
JORDAN Base, this is Crew Leader Six.  What is your E.T.A. on that rescue helo? Over. 
BASE (V.O.) Crew Leader, we have a Medevac rerouting from Long Beach, but no other helos prepped at this time. Seafox One and Two are launching now.  Over. 
A beat. 
JORDAN Base, don't think you copied me.  We are 12 miles out.  Seafox tops out at 30 knots, which makes it a no- show for 18 minutes.  Over. 
BASE (V.O.) You copied right, Crew Leader. We're looking for options ourselves. 
SLUTNIK Maybe we should call the Coast Guard. 
JORDAN Shut your hole, Slutnik. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
McCool surfaces. 
MCCOOL Visibility drops dead at 40 feet. If they're deeper than that... 
The others surface and swim in. 
CORTEZ Nobody's comin' outta that crash, el-tee.  Nobody. 
A grim beat -- and then A CRACKLE on the radio.  With a voice seemingly from the far side of the moon: 
THE CHIEF (V.O.) Base, this is Basher One.  I've got a small problem here.  Do you copy? 
Jaws drop. 
JORDAN (into radio) Basher One, this is O'Neil.  We are barely reading you.  What is your situation? 
EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
50 feet down, the helo lies canted on a reef shelf. 
JORDAN So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each.  'Cool?  How much air in yours? 
MCCOOL Maybe half.  Not even. 
JORDAN Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it.  Cortez, help him.  Flea?  You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead. 
CORTEZ What, we're gonna pry 'em out with paddles? 
MCCOOL (grabbing her) O'Neil.  Our air's gonna crap out as soon as we get down there.  You know that, don't you? 
JORDAN So I guess we get one shot at it. 
INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
Swimming in his own blood, the Chief starts to fade away, losing consciousness.  But then, through the cockpit windscreen... 
A hazy orb of light above him.  The orb grows and grows until it resolves into a flare carried by his would-be savior.  Jordan. 
THE CHIEF Why'd it have to be her... 
EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
Reaching the downed Helo, McCool and Cortez wedge their oars under the fuselage and leverage hard until... 
An opening appears. 
Jordan and Flea swim into the breach... 
INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
... and surface inside the wreckage. 
JORDAN Chief, sir... still with me? 
CHIEF (unbuckling co-pilot) Take him first.  Once he's clear, come back with -- 
JORDAN Sir, let me suggest you stop giving orders and start doing exactly what I say, because that's the only way we're all getting out of here.  Now how's your vest check out?  Still good? 
EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
McCool's air craps out.  He abandons his oar and swims for the surface.  That leaves only... 
Cortez, struggling mightily to keep the escape route open. He knows his mini-tank is running on empty -- and it scares the bejeezus out of him. 
INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
JORDAN Flea, take the pilot up slow, feed him air.  Chief, sir, you and I are gonna take the express elevator outta here.  Remember to let your air out.  Ready? 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
Twin transports -- Seafox One and Two -- pound across the water.  Instructors sweep binoculars, trying to spot... 
The ILB.  Newberry POPS A FLARE skyward as Slutnik DOWNLOADS INFO over the radio. 
EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
Cortez's air goes dead.  He gives it three more seconds, eyes riveted on the underside of the helo, knowing they have to come out... right... fucking... absolutely... 
NOW:  Jordan appears with the Chief.  Flea is at their heels with the co-pilot. 
Cortez drops his oar as if it were radioactive and swims for the sky. 
The HELO BOOMS back down onto the reef. 
Jordan yanks the cord on the Chief's vest.  It inflates instantly.  One arm raised, Jordan streaks for the surface... 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
... and "Supermans" into daylight with the Chief.  They covered 50 feet in four seconds. 
Doing a 360, Jordan spots... 
Seafox One coming their way. 
Jordan waves like a shipwreck victim. 
Not slowing, Seafox lowers a recovery rig into place: They're wasting no time on the pick-up. 
Remembering the last time she tried this, Jordan gets a death-grip on the Chief's vest.

13 FEBRUARY 1998 
"I wish that I could write you a melody so plain That would save you dear lady from going insane" Bob Dylan, Tombstone Blues 
BLACK 
MUSIC UP: Slow, sad, ethereal. Perhaps even eerie. 
FADE IN: 
On a sea of red, filling the frame. A crimson ocean without waves or ripples. 
A thick housepainter's BRUSH dips in, revealing its paint. The BRUSH is extracted, paint dripping like congealing blood. FOLLOW THE BRUSH to reveal... 
INT. A HOUSE - NIGHT 
A white wall, where the BRUSH is moved horizontally, leaving a thick continuous stripe, until the paint thins out. A WOMAN'S HAND plunges the BRUSH back into the paint can, then takes up creating the stripe again, painting the wall: until it reaches &pleated drape -- -- and doesn't stop. A window and another drape receive the same treatment before the BRUSH is re-dipped. 
A PUPPY, a sad-eyed basset hound, sits on the floor watching, a bit perplexed. This is WALTER and even he knows this is weird. The dog looks over to... 
A FOUR-YEAR-OLD GIRL standing next to him, also watching. This is RACHEL. Dark haired, in a plain dress. Her large eyes are welling on the verge of tears. 
The BRUSH is dragged across the wall, hits a wooden picture frame, moves across a cheap oil painting of a pastoral, forest scene, and over the other edge of the frame. 
Another ANGLE takes in the red line, five feet high, parallel to the floor, extending around a modest living room. 
Painting the line is BARBARA LANG, in her thirties, yet worn, haggard- She hasn't slept in a while. 
The precision of her work, her concentration, her focus, as the line runs across a wall and into a corner, is more than a little frightening. 
RACHEL 
Mommy 
BARBARA hears nothing, says nothing, just wipes a paint drip. This is a very careful line. 
RACHEL Momma, come play with me. In my room. But her mother keeps painting across a door. 
RACHEL Right now, mommy, okay? BARBARA looks at her, or rather through her. And continues her task. RACHEL steps forward, tugs on her mom's 
RACHEL I got a idea, we could-- -- and gets , , splat, right-in the face with the brush 
THE KITCHEN A TOY AMBULANCE sits on the floor. RACHEL's tiny hand deliberately presses a button on it. The TOY responds with a wheep whe ep siren, then: 
AMBULANCE VOICE 
(CANNED; TINNY) If you need help, dial nine one one. If you need help, dial nine one one. 
A WALL-MOUNTED PHONE RACHEL's HAND struggles to reach the buttons to dial 9-1-1. BARBARA's still painting the wall in the background. 
RACHEL (O.S.) Hello? It's my mom. She's doing some... some wrong things. She's doing wrong things, so, and, you should come. 
EXT. THE STREET - FROM ABOVE - NIGHT 
A light rain falls on an AMBULANCE sitting next to a POLICE Its dashing red lights CRUISER with its doors flung open. splash over the umbrella carrying NEIGHBORS, in pajamas and robes, watching... 
(TO RACHEL) Was the dog in the house last night? He's allowed in the morning. 
BOYD (head in refrigerator) Daytime, yes; nighttime, no. We've been over this ground. I only brought him in this morning. No juice? 
EMILYN We're out of a lot of things. 
(TO RACHEL) I heard dog noises last night. When I was trying to sleep. 
(LOUDER) Walter was not in the house last night. 
BOYD (shoots Rachel a look) You watch that voice in this house. While you're here, you'll respect her as your mother, and treat her as such. 
RACHEL (lowers her eyes, mumbles) Sorry. She picks through her cold cereal in silence. 
EMILYN Your mom's making progress isn't she, on the new medicacions, the tricyclics? 
RACHEL Yes, ma'am. 
(BEAT) May I be excused? Without waiting for a reply, she stands and gathers the bowl. (casually, a routine) And you should take that thing outta your nose. Don't you have enough holes in your head? As she turns away, RACHEL makes a face, but replies. 
RACHEL Yes, sir. 
EXT. HOUSE - MORNING 
RACHEL stands outside, clad in a long dark overcoat, with a black backpack. WALTER sits next to her, behind a fence. A YELLOW SCHOOL BUS pulls up. 
RACHEL Later, Walt. On WALTER, bummed. 
WITHIN THE SCHOOL BUS A gaggle of young KIDS in faded denims and pastels. RACHEL moves to the back, sits with LISA PARKER, who could be her younger sister, also dressed Goth, black lace and metal. LISA has a HEART-THORN TATTOO around her arm, like RACHEL's. 
LISA 
(SMILES) Well, hullo. 
RACHEL She speaks. She opens her mouth and sounds come out. The sounds are words. LTA gives her a Cheshire cat grin. 
LISA What's wrong, fcscer-dad bein' a pain again? 
RACHEL Why are you so weiz.ly happy? 
LISA o I look any different? 
RACHEL Do you look any... 
(GETTING IT) Oh, my gawd. You did it. 
LISA Yep. With who? 
LISA You'd never believe me if I told you. I'm bringing him to lunch. 
RACHEL C'mon. ' 1 Fess up. 
LISA All will be revealed in due time. RACHEL pulls out a worn Anne Rice paperback from her ba gives it to LISA. 
RACHEL You suck. 
LISA I love you too. Simultaneously, they bite their thumbs, then press them together; a pantomime of blood sisters. 
LISA / RACHEL Best Blood. / Best Blood. ARNIE, a skinny, pimply stoner, plops into the seat behind them, sticks his head on their seatback, smiles full braces. 
ARNIE Hi there gruesome twosome, how 'bout a threesome? 
ENGLISH TEACHER Romeo and Juliet, a tale of two lovers meant for each other, pulled apart by their families, society, and, some might say, by fate. 
(BEAT) Why is it that we are so moved by love stories that end with separation? The STUDENT' s faces are blank. 
ENGLISH TEACHER What are some other stories with this theme? 
(NO RESPONSES) How about, Dr. Zhivago? Casablanca? Still blank. AMY timidly raises her hand. 
AMY You meair like in Dumb and when the girl's husband showed up? The TEACHER surrenders to the inevitable. 
ENGLISH TEACHER Okay, well. Perhaps at some level we know that Lauren Holly's husband AIM to show up? What say? Anyone? 
(BEAT) Rachel? I don't know that I believe in it. 
ENGLISH TEACHER Believe in what? 
RACHEL Love. JESSE looks at her, pensive. 
ENGLISH TEACHER 
(SYMPATHETIC) Well, then you've got bigger problems than passing this crass. 
ARNIE (raises his hand) Love is fifteen seconds of squishing noises. Unquote. Johnny Rotten. Scattered laughs. JESSE overhears TRACY as she nods at RACHEL, whispers to AMY... 
TRACY Who would love her? 
ENGLISH TEACHER Do you think that all love stories are tragedies? I mean, unless they die at the same time, all lovers are eventually separated by death. 
JESSE Well, then Romeo and Juliet isn't a tragedy, because the only way they could really be together was in death. 
ENGLISH TEACHER Very good. (nods at Rachel) A foul cynic, most cliche. (turns to Jesse) A true romantic, how refreshing. Kids scoff at JESSE, but RACHEL eyes JESSE, struck by this side of him. The BELL rings and ARNIE leads the exodus. 
ARNIE Food! 
ENGLISH TEACHER Next assignment, Brave New World, the book, not the TV movie. 
INT, HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY A stone-faced LISA folds a NOTE, places it within her hallway locker, jammed to the brim with books; a photo of Fiona Apple and a Nine Inch Nails sticker are plastered on its door. 
EXT. ICE SCHOOL. THE REAR PARKING LOT - LUNCHTIME 
STUDENTS pour out the doors, some heading to a row of outside lockers. RACHEL appears, searching for LISA. 
BACK TO: 
THE SCHOOL HALLWAY LISA walks as if moving through extremely dense air, hugging the wall as STUDENTS pass without acknowledging her. 
HACK TO: 
THE PARKING LOT RACHEL looks around the students, sees a GIRL's HEAD from behind, realizes it isn't LISA. 
BACK TO: 
A STAIRWELL LISA ascends several flights, still brushing the wall, exiting onto the... 
SCHOOL'S ROOF She walks past a TRIO OF STUDENTS smoking near the roof's edge. Without slowing or blinking an eyelash LISA simply.. 
DROPS OUT OF FRAME. A GIRL turns in the direction of LISA's disappearance. 
SMOKING GIRL Did you see that? 
SHOCK CUT TO: 
(PAUSE) Copycats. Everybody got it? Nods all around. 
PRINCI PAL Then let's go with the drill. A TEACHER reads from the prepared statement to her class. 
TEACHER One of our students died today. -- A FOREST -- Glimpses of RACHEL running through the trees. -- SUE at a microphone, reading from a sheet of paper: 
SUE We will observe, at exactly two p.m... -- Her voice emanates from an INTERCOM BOX high on a classroom wall. STUDENTS bow their heads.

SUE (V.3.) Lisa Parker may be gone, but she will not be forgotten by her friends. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
ERIC surreptitiously passes MARK something under a desk, a large pocket NOTEBOOK. A GIRL picks her nose. A 3CY yawns. Another BOY absently fiddles with his crucifix as he reads a comic book. 
A GIRL and a BOY whisper to each other, then stifle a laugh. 
SUE {V.0.) She will not be forgotten, by her fellow students, her teachers, and her school. 
EXT. THE FOREST - DAY 
RACHEL sits on rock in a clearing, observing her own moment of silence. She looks at her hand. It's trembling and still covered with LISA's BLOOD.

INT. STATE HOSPITAL, VISITING AREA - DAY 
The dilapidated room is a statue garden of catatonics and depressives seated on vinyl furniture before a static-filled T.V. PATIENTS shuffle past like motorized corpses. BARBARA LANG, now in her 40's, sits on a couch with a transformed RACHEL. BARBARA is lucid and beaming at her. 
BARBARA Yes, baby, I really am feeling so much better. I feel so good on the inside, I must be glowing on the outside. 
RACHEL You look great, mama. 
BARBARA Lord, you come all the way out here, we can't keep talking about me. How are you? I wane to hear every little thing I'm missing. 
RACHEL takes a deep breath, working extra hard to seem happy and well adjusted today. 
RACHEL Things are really great. Last night I, um, I had this slumber party, with some girlfriends. And this morning, Mrs. Wallace made us all pancakes before school. 
BARBARA The Wallaces sure are a nice family. 
RACHEL (her smile falters) Oh, they are. A nice family. 
BARBARA What's wrong? 
RACHEL Nothing, I just... I miss those crepes you used to make me. 
ERIC Lisa took a picture of me with. her. 
MARK Shit. Okay. I'll handle it. 
ERIC How? 
MARK Eric, relax, its me, Mark. I'll handle it. The WAITER sets a pitcher of soda and cups on the table. AT THE BAR -- MR. STARK, a rotund lawyer in his 40's, takes a pitcher of beer from the BARTENDER. 
BARTENLER I don't see nuthin'. STARK strolls to the booth with the pitcher in hand. He sits, hiding the pitcher below table level. 
STARK Hello, boys. 
ERIC Hi, dad. STARK winks, takes MARK's empty cup and fills it with beer below the table. 
STARK Great game last week. All of us on the town council are awful proud. He hands MARK the cup under the table and takes JESSE's cup. The PLAYERS smile at each other. 
STARK So, the Bulldogs bringing home the state championship again this year? 
MARK Absolutely. We're gonna crush Carlin Friday and make it seven years in a'row. 
STARK That's what I like to hear. 
MARK (offers a toast to Jesse) It's good to be king. 
INT.SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY 
A CRASH of metal as the lock is cut off Lisa Parker's locker with a pair of boltcutters held by SHERIFF KELTON, 30"s, a former Bulldog himself. The PRINCIPAL and SUE stand nearby. Opening the locker, KELTON finds LISA's NOTE. As he pulls it out, something falls from the note. 
SUE What is it? 
KELTON 
(READS) Looks like a suicide note. (bending to retrieve) .and a stub. Royal Photos. 
EXT. ROYAL DRIVE-THRU PHOTCMAT - DAY 
RACHEL's at her job, an island in the middle of a parking lot. She wears her Walkman, listening to music. Across the street is a 7-11 type store. 
INT. MINIMART - DAY 
ARNIE,che sweet-natured stoner, mops the floor. He waves to RACHEL, who gives him a half-hearted wave back. 
INT. ROYAL PHOTOMAT - DAY 
Photos glide out of the developing machine. RACHEL pulls the pictures out, stops dead when she sees they're shots of LISA; With RACHEL, laughing. LISA with Rachel's dog. RACHEL's finger tenderly slides along LISA's face. She's shocked to find a picture of -- LISA AND ERIC -- his arm draped around her in the backseat of a car. LISA's holding the camera at arm's length. JESSE's CAR pulls up outside. MARK sits beside him. 
RACHEL 
(STARTLED) Oh! She peels off her headphones. 
JESSE Sorry, didn't scare you, did I? RACHEL turns, slides LISA's PICTURES into an envelope. MARK checks her out, likes what.he sees, nudges JESSE. 
JESSE You're... Rachel, right? She nods, surprised he knows she's alive, much less knows her name. 
JESSE I'm Jesse. 
RACHEL Uh-huh. The true romantic. MARK leans over JESSE, his voice low now, intimate. 
MARK So, Rachel, there were some pictures Lisa took. They have, what you might call sentimental value. She just stares at him. MARK pulls a twenty from his wallet. 
MARK Twenty bucks cover it? 
INT. RACHEL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
SMASH as a dish drops onto the floor. RACHEL is at the sink, doing dishes. She crouches to retrieve the broken plate. WE PAN along the chorus line of dishes, glasses, and silverware on the counter as the metronome of the sink faucet's DRIP, DRIP, DRIP and the micro-explosions of the soap bubbles in the water intensify to deafening levels. TIGHT ON a SPOON atop the counter which suddenly begins dancing. Pots and pans on a hanging rack start rattling. A RUMBLE as more dishes and utensils vibrate and rattle, as if by a paranormal force. But as RACHEL casually straightens up and looks out the window, it's revealed it's only... 
EXT. RACHEL' S HOUSE - NIGHT 
BOYD driving a large SEMI-TRUCK pulling alongside the tiny house. Its engine shuts off.., 
THE KITCHEN .and the spoons and dishes stop vibrating. 
RACHEL (singsong, to herself) Daddy's home. She walks to her bedroom and closes the door. 
EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 
BOYD goes to shut the open fence and WALTER, the basset hound, scurries past him and into the street. 
BOYD Come back here, mutt. 
(WHISTLES LOUDLY) Aw, good riddance. And he closes the gate. 
INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
RACHEL lays in bed, staring at the ceiling. BOYD knocks on her door.

INT. JESSE'S CAR - NIGHT 
JESSE's driving alone, wiping Tracy's lipstick from his cheek. 
EXT. THE STREET -NIGHT 
's in her overcoat over her longjohns. She looks down the road and blanches as she sees WALTER trotting towards... The road in front of him, a two-lane blacktop with CARS and TRUCKS streaming by at high speed. 
RACHEL Walter! And she breaks into a run. WALTER looks back, starts running, this is all fun for him. There's the low BLEAT of a TRUCK'S HORN and then... The high, piercing SQUEAL of a wounded animal. In the road, WALTER, laying flat, keening in pain. She runs to him and in one continuous motion SCOOPS him into her arms. RACHEL, in the middle of the two lanes. She turns as.__ 
HEADLIGHTS approach, fast. 
She stumbles under the dog's weight, tries flagging down a car. 
RACHEL Help me! Please! It speeds past, dangerously close. Another set of LIGHTS. 
RACHEL Stop! Please, stop! But the CAR passes, blaring its horn. She spins,around. is bearing down on her. She holds her ground. 
RACHEL THE CAR'S WINDSHIELD -- CRACKS, crazes, as if it hit with a sharp, fierce projectile. THE CAR -- lays down rubber as it screeches to a halt. JESSE is at the wheel. Sees through the crazed windshield: RACHEL, splattered with dog's blood. He gets out, stares at his'windshield, shaken-up, groping for some explanation. 
JESSE Damn. What... damn. RACHEL staggers up to him, holding a shivering mass of fur. 
RACHEL 
PLEASE-- 
JESSE Oh, my god. 
. JESSE'S CAR - NIGHT JESSE driving. RACHEL sits next to him, hugging the dog. 
RACHEL It's my fault. He should have been in bed with me. 
JESSE Everything's gonna be all right. His voice is not entirely convincing. 
Through the spidered windshield: The car's headlights pierce the night. 
RACHEL Sometimes I'd see someone, from behind, and I'd know, I'd just know, it was Lisa. And then she'd turn ound, and it wasn't. But sometimes, you know, it was. And now... 
(PAUSES) Whenever I see someone who looks like her, and she turns around... it won't be... ever. They both go quiet, not knowing what to say. 
JESSE (looks at his latch) Wow. It's late. "ve got football practice tomorrow. 
RACHEL I know. I hope I didn't ru;.n 
JESSE No, if it wasn't for you I wouldn't have had this nutritious medl, 
RACHEL You're very polite, for a jock. 
JESSE The compliments, they just keep on comin'. He drops some money on the table. 
RACHEL I don't have any-- 
JESSE 's cool, I got it. Can I give you a Et home or something? I can walk 
JESSE Yeah, right.

RACHEL Sure. 
JESSE You'll let me know how Walter's doing? 
RACHEL Yeah. 
JESSE Good night. He extends his hand. She takes it. 3i2! The SHOCK of static electricity. Their words are simultaneous. 
RACHEL Dry weather. 
JESSE Acrylic sweater. They both laugh. Then go quiet. Then just stare at each other. Then the moment is gone. RACHEL gets out of the car, through the gate, back inside her house. JESSE watches her go. Starts his engine, and his car 
WIPES THE FRAME TO: 
EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY 
RACHEL crossing the lot. Her HEARTBEAT can be heard. She looks up, sees LISA approaching the roof's edge. RACHEL's heart sounds like its bursting from her chest. 
RACHEL I guess. I mean, you seem pretty normal. 
SUE Thanks. i try. You visit your moat often? 
SUE Is that scary for you? 
RACHEL Why? 
SUE Well, children of schizophrenics sometimes live with the fear of it happening to them. At your age, it's perfectly normal to be afraid of turning out like your parents. 
RACHEL Normal, huh? Get real, I know I'm ten times more likely to get it than most people. 
SUE You're right. I'm sorry. So. You've been in a series of foster homes since you were, what, four? 
RACHEL N 
SUE How's your foster family? 
RACHEL They're happy, - 'z-rig as they get their check every month. 
SUE What about your real father? 
RACHEL Never met the gentleman. My mom won't even tell me his name. RACHEL stares at a ceramic MUG of coffee, very close o the edge of the desk. 
SUE Rachel, in a way, you've lost your mother. And now you've lost a friend. Losing someone can be a very lonely, painful place to be. 
RACHEL 
(QUIETLY) You're right, I.lost my mom, I lost my, friend, the people who cared about me. But you only get paid to care. 
SUE I really do care. How can I show you that I do? RACHEL is silent, staring at the MUG. 
SUE Rachel? But RACHEL's shut off, pushing down a storm of emotions. 
SUE You know, this room is a place where if you have feelings, you can talk about them. You can let them out. RACHEL shifts. SUE sees RACHEL's forearm near the coffee MUG. And, as if by proximity alone, it EDGES off the end of the desk -- And FALLS -- RACHEL catches it in one smooth motion just before it hits. 
RACHEL sorry. I must've knocked it. SUE, the color draining from her face. 
SUE I didn't... see you knock it. 
The DOOR swings open and the PRINCIPAL walks in, lays a computer printout on her desk. 
PRINCIPAL Sue, could you update the absentee lists, see who we have to call? 
SUE 
(DAZED) ure... sure. She turns, and RACHEL is gone. 
NT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY ERIC is at his locker, wearing his BULLDOG letter jacket. He closes his locker to find RACHEL approaching him, intimidated, but determined. She looks him in the eyes. 
RACHEL 
(LOW) know. I know what you did. A chill goes through him. Not saying a word, he turns, walks through the crowd, looks back. She's still rooted, staring him down. 
EXT. FREAK HALL - LUNCH 
ARNIE plays hackey-sack behind RACHEL, who sits on the steps. She looks up, sees a BULLDOG letter jacket standing over her. It's JESSE. 
JESSE Hi. How's Walter? 
RACHEL 
(INTO PHONE) I have an emergency. Now, right now! Yes, 3366 Elm Street... She turns, sees the HAND at the window. 
RACHEL No! The WINDOW SMASHES down on the intruder's HAND. There's a muffled YELL outside and the HAND is extracted. 
EXT. THE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Headlights light up MARK's face as BOYD and EMILYN's beat-up STATION WAGON approaches the house. MARK whistles loudly. And takes off, joined by ERIC, clutching his injured hand. 
â¢ SE - NIGHT RACHEL, still stunned by what just happened. The cordless in her hand speaks: 
911 OPERATOR (V.O. ) Hello? Hello, :Ma'am, you still there? RACHEL slowly moves to tier bedroom doorway. BOYD comes in the front door. 
RACHEL 
(INTO PHONE) Yes. It's okay. Things are fine. She hangs up as a clueless BOYD takes in her freaked-out appearance. 
BOYD What's wrong? 
RACHEL Nothing. She retreats into her bedroom, looks at the Window. The PHONE RINGS in her hand. She answers. 
MARK (V.0.) Don't go tellin' stories about my Eric. Click and the line goes dead. She hangs up. The PHONE RINGS again. She doesn't answer. 
THE LIVING ROOM The PHONE RINGS on another extension. EMI, swers. 
EMILYN Hello... just a second. Rachel? 
RACHEL curled on her bed with WALTER, calls out: 
RACHEL I'm not here.

EXT. SCHOOL ENTRANCE - DAY 
A SCREAMING DEVIL fills the frame. The bed of a speeding PICK-UP TRUCK is jammed with kneeling TEENAGE BOYS wearing children's Halloween masks. They're screaming bloody murder as they fire RAW EGGS at... The BERGEN STUDENTS gathered at the entrance. The PICK-UP speeds off as STUDENTS recover, straightening up from their ducking positions. MARK and his cohorts go running after the truck. 
TRACY Carlin creeps! At Freak Hall, ARNIE rises, wipes egg yolk from his hair. 
ARNIE 
(SLOWLY) Hormonally-charged mo,,,ï¿½r 'âns. Why do the innocent always get hit in a drive-by? RACHEL looks up, sees JESSE approaching. Her eyes flare. 
JESSE Hey, what happened to you last night? I waited. 
RACHEL You tell me what happened last night. 
JESSE What? ON RACHEL and JESSE as she tells him what happened last night. He gets more and more agitated. TRACY is wearing her glasses as she and MONICA watch JESSE from the Patio. 
TRACY What is wrong with this movie: does he see in her? 
MONICA Come on Trace, you're caviar, she's cheeze whiz. He'll come around. He's just letting little Jesse do the thinking for big Jesse. BACK TO -- A pissed-off JESSE. 
JESSE Okay, don't worry, I'll talk to Mark, I'll take care of it

EXT. ARKHAII STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - DAY 
SUE'S red VOLVO sits before the entrance to the hospital. SUE looks at HER EYES in the rearview mirror, takes a deep breathe to summon her courage. 
SUE

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY 
SUE strides up to the reinforced door. The sudden BUZZ o the lock seems to cut through her. She hesitates, then pushes in to... 
THE VISITING AREA .and approaches the NURSES STATION. 
SUE I'm here to see Barbara Lang. 
NURSE Stay here, I'll get her. SUE looks around. This place holds a lot of bad memories. DOCTOR NELSON, SO's, an overworked-underpaid psychiatrist approaches with a smiling MALE PATIENT. 
DOCTOR Suzy? Suzy Snell? 
SUE Hello, Doctor Nelson. 
DOCTOR Suzy Snell, one of my rare success stories. What brings you back? 
SUE I'm visiting the mother of one of my students. 
DOCTOR I heard about the good work you're doing at the high school. The PATIENT turns and softly starts thudding his forehead against the wall. The DOCTOR casually pulls him away before he can harm himself. 
R Excuse me, Sue. (towing the Patient) Come see me after. I'd like to hear how you're doing. 
INT. THE VISITING'AREA - DAY 
SUE sits before BARBARA, who's picking her way though the chocolates. The MOANS of PATIENTS seem to rattle S 
BARBARA Thank you for the chocolates. Thoughtful of you. 
S 
AT) Mrs. Lang, why didn't you ever tell Rachel who her father was? 
BARBAR. Wasn't important. Why was it important for her not to know? 
BARBARA Why would she need to? Hrs. Lang, I need to know who he was. 
BARBARA sorry, that's private. 
JESSE He got two letters back. one was a form letter which said, 'Thank you for your support.' 
RACHEL And the other? 
JESSE The other was from Hubert Humphrey. 
RACHEL Who? 
JESSE He was the vice-President once. He wrote back a three page letter, raving about a place called Wally's Burger Hut. My dad was knocked-out. 
RACHEL So your dad wrote a book, color me impressed. 
JESSE He never wrote it. Or he was going to, and then my sister was born, and then I was born. And there was this car dealership, and it was security. So your dad wanted to be a writer. How'd his kid end up being this sweaty armpit jock? 
JESSE 
(BEAT) Sometimes when they throw me the ball, it feels like time just slows down. And I know where to be and how to get there. When I have that feeling I catch it. Always. Every time. 
RACHEL And you like that. 
JESSE Yeah, I love it. Except. My dad. He's got my life all mapped out. He wants me to take over the business. 
RACHEL What's wrong with that? Sounds like a nice life. 
JESSE Selling used cars is not what I want. And, unless I nail that football scholarship,' that's what I'll get. 
(EXHALES) Wow. I can't believe I'm telling you all this. I've never said any of this out loud to anyone before. (takes a long look at her) Must be great not having to be like anyone else. 
RACHEL It's not so great. Sometimes I wish I could just be one of the shiny, happy people. Does that surprise you? 
JESSE Everything about you surprises me. There's the soft pops of rain hitting the car as it begins to drizzle, then it comes down hard. 
WITHIN THE CAR RACHEL and JESSE are in front, facing each other, leaning against the doors as rain streams against the windows. 
RACHEL 
(SITS FORWARD) I used to know this guy, could suck a strand of spaghetti through his mouth and out his nose. He called it Brain Flossing. JESSE smiles. 
RACHEL He had a talent. You. You got football. It'll get you outta this place. You can make your own path after that. Write your own book. 
JESSE Yeah? Want to come with me? She smiles. He leans forward. And she pulls away-, afraid, then decides to let him. They kiss. Then she pulls away. 
JESSE What? 
HEL This... She indicates the gear shift. 
HEL is poking me right in the ribs. JE55E's eyes flicker to the back seat. 
RACHEL Um, I don't know how to say this. 
JESSE Yeah? 
RACHEL But I've never... 
JESSE Oh. 
RACHEL And, I'd want it to be special. Like you ring the doorbell, with flowers in your hand. 
JESSE Right. So... what's your favorite flower? 
RACHEL 
JESSE I will predict your future. 
RACHEL Uh-huh. Can I get a hint? 
JESSE 'm in it. ON THE PATIO -- are TRACY, MARK and MONICA, watching the. 
TRACY If he's gonna do it, you know, be seen talking in public with someone else, he should show some respect. (a slow boil) He should show me the respect, at least, to be seen with someone pretty. Someone cool. Someone who counts. Amy or you, you know, ate. Instead, it's Its. And I feel... 
MONICA Disrespected? 
TRACY That's right. I wish there was something I could do to make him come to his senses. On MARK's face, a slow, insidious grin that seems to spread into eternity appears. 
TRACY What? 
MARK Let's nail the bitch. Plan a way to screw her like she's screwing us. .TRACY, a wicked smile as she nods. 
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY 
RACHEL watches SUE at the door, speaking to her TEACHER. SUE points to RACHEL, who looks less than thrilled. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
A dark smudge is spread on the empty parking space where LISA died. No one parks there anymore. SUE is escorting RACHEL to her VOLVO. 
RACHEL (V.0.) Where are you taking me? 
SUE (V.0.) There's something you have to see. 
EXT. THE WOODS - DAY 
A DREAM-LIKE GLIDE past SUE's VOLVO, parked on the roadside, and through the trees. 
SUE (V.0.) This used to be the school for the whole district. Chamberlain High. It was closed down in 1976. 
FAST DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE OLD GYM - DAY 
A burned-out hulk, shrouded in mist. 
SUE (V.0.) There was a fire here that year. The night of the prom. Seventy-three people died. A few of us survived. 
INT. THE DESTROYED GYM - DAY 
Dark; full of exposed wires, metal rods and pipes, countless empty beer cans. Two mattresses are laid out amid the debris. SUE stands on a pile of rubble, next to RACHEL. There's a haunted look on SUE's face. 
FLASH TO: 
GYM - PROM NIGHT, 1976 (STOCK) STROBING IMAGES of CARRIE WHITE, drenched in pig's blood. Sounds of horrible SCREAMING. Flashes of.KIDS stampeding. Burning. Dying. A fire rages behind CARRIE as she steps off a platform, turns and looks at us with the face of an avenging angel. 
BACK TO. 
THE DESTROYED GYM, present day, as SUE flinches. 
SUE I haven't really been here in over twenty years. But it feels like I've been back here every day since. 
RACHEL Happy homecoming. Can we go? This place is spooky. Gives me the creeps. 
SUE Do you know what happened here? 
RACHEL You just said. A fire. 
(BEAT) No, really. Look, this shade would look very kissable on you. Soft. MONICA goes to apply the lipstick on her. RACHEL pulls away. 
MONICA Trust me. See, Tracy tried to steal Brad from me. Now hold still. And RACHEL does. 
MONICA So, he invite you to the game? Just nod. RACHEL nods. 
MONICA Well, there's a big party after. I hope you can go. I know it would mean a lot to Jesse if we all got along. 
RACHEL Uh-huh. 
MONICA Good. See? Checking in a mirror, RACHEL sees she's right. 
MONICA Here, these two would also rock on you. The SALESWOMAN reappears. 
SALESWOMAN Can I ring those up? 
RACHEL Um, sure. How much are these? 
SALESWOMAN Twenty-two fifty. Each. RACHEL sets the lipsticks down. MONICA smiles at the 
SALESWOMAN. 
MONICA Maybe next time. Bye. She pulls RACHEL away. As they walk the SALESWOMAN keeps looking at RACHEL with distaste. 
MONICA (a conspiratorial smile) Here, I kleptoed it for you. She slips RACHEL the lipstick. 
INT. RACHEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
RACHEL before the mirror, applying the lipstick. A P.J. HARVEY song plays under, slow, insistent, seductive: 
P.J. HARVEY She's burst/ dropped off! picked the fruit! realize! I'm naked / I'm naked too./ So cover rrry body/ dress it fine/ hide my linen and lace. She pulls on a silver, thrift-shop SLIP DRESS, moves a slee ve to cover her tattoo. 
P.J. HARVEY (cont'd) So fruit flower myself inside out/ I'm happy and bleeding for you / fruit flower myself inside out / I'm tired and bleeding for you... She slips off her nose stud. 
EXT. RACHEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
JESSE waiting in his car. He looks up -- RACHEL stands under the porch light in her dress. A lanky gangster girl, with. one leg planted on a step like a cocked gun. She's bone-chillingly beautiful. He gets out, opens the car door for her. 
JESSE What happened to that little thing you wear, that, uh... He gestures to hib'nose, indicating her stud. 
RACHEL Took it off. 
JESSE Too bad. I like it. It's different. RACHEL looks at the car seat. On it are DAISIES. 
JESSE 
(SMILES) Just, you know, throw'em in the back. 
EXT. A CABIN - NIGHT 
A small cabin in the woods. Fire light in the window. JESSE's CAR is parked in t;^.e gravel alongside. 
INT. THE CABIN - NIGHT 
JESSE is stoking a fire in the fireplace. There's a MOOSE HEAD TROPHY on the wall. RACHEL's sitting on a bed, draped with a chenille spread. 
JESSE It was nice of mark to lend us the place. He's really tryin' to make peace. Invited .s to his party. But we won't go if y;,u,d be uncomfortable. 
He moves to the bed. 
RACHEL No. Let's go. 
The entire town has showed for this traditional rivalry and there's Bulldog paraphernalia galore. RACHEL appears in the stands, looking a bit lost. Down front sit MONICA and AMY. On the field are TRACY and her fellow CHEERLEADERS. MONICA nudges AMY and waves to 
MONICA Rachel, Rach, over here. Hey. Grab a seat. Looking around, RACHEL sees she's surrounded by Patio People. 
RACHEL Thanks, but... 
MONICA Oh, please, you're.not gonna sit by your lonesome. There's plenty of room, if Amy;here slides her bubble butt. 
AMY 
(DRY) Very witty, Ms. Bulimia. But she moves over. RACHEL tentatively sits. 
INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT 
JESSE enters, mounds of hair are at his feet. He looks up. MARK and most of the BULLDOGS have shaved their heads and are working on the last players. They turn to him in unison. CHUCK grins, runs his hand over his scalp. 
CHUCK We did it for the big game. 
MARK C'mon, Jess, you're up. JESSE stares in horror at how identical they all look now. Then he starts to... giggle, then breaks into laughter, turns and walks away. 
A P-ALN Man, he'll ruin the whole effect. 
EXT. THE STANDS - NIGHT 
MONICA and RACHEL. 
MONICA No, no, it's an extra point when you score the kick after the touchdown. A safety is when you get tackled with the ball in your own end zone. 
RACHEL Thought that was a bunt. What? 
RACHEL I'm kidding, I'm kidding. 
MONICA Okay, listen. Here's what Brad told me to say, doesn't matter if something good or bad happens, just say "You. gotta be fuckin' kiddin' mel" No matter what, just say that. It'll sound like you know what's going on. 
INT. STADIUM TUNNEL - NIGHT 
JESSE and the team move through a dark tunnel and onto... 
THE FOOTBALL FIELD with all the pageantry and sheer rush of a hometown crowd. The school band plays like they're going to bust a gut. Hysteria and bloodlust fill the air as the crowd starts a barking chant. 
JESSE on the sideline bench. He scans the crowd behind him, sees. A NOTRE DAME SCOUT, wearing a "Fighting Irish jacket, toting a clipboard. JESSE then spots RACHEL in the stands, gives her a reassuring grin. She glances at the SCOUT, smiles back at JESSE. TRACY sees them, is none too happy. SLOW MOTION -- A whistle sounds as a FOOTBALL is kicked to start the game. The BALL spins end over end until... 
It's caught by a BULLDOG receiver who starts his return, then is popped hard and FUMBLES. An OPPOSING PLAYER leaps onto the ball on the muddy quagmire of a field. n the stands... 
RACHEL, MONICA, AMY (in accidental unison) You gotta be fuckin' kiddie' me! They turn to each other, burst into laughter. MONTAGE -- of the punishing game. Epic warfare with grunting, spitting and cursing as LINEMAN butt heads and. -- A CARLIN RUNNING BACK steamrolls through the BULLDOGS for a touchdown. -- RACHEL, MONICA and AMY do their You gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me routine. JESSE catches a pass, and is immediately slammed hard 
CARLIN PLAYER. RACHEL looks like she's been kicked in the gut. 
RACHEL Do they have to hit him that hard? 
MONICA Amy, Rachel's worried about Jesse. 
AMY Don't worry, i always looks worse than it really 
CUT TO: TRACY and the other CHEERLEADERS leading a cheer as... JESSE glances at the sideline, where the NOTRE DAME FOOTBALL SCOUT watches him, writing notes on his clipboard. THE HALF-TIME SCOREBOARD and the BULLDOGS trail 7- On the sideline, MARK SMASHES his helmet to the ground. 
INT. ARKHAM STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
mpatient SUE sits before an exhausted DOCTOR NELSON. 
DOCTOR Well... I understand you need to take out Mrs. Lang, to do a drug-abuse intervention with her daughter. But while she's doing well, her condition may be fragile. 
The bedroom door is opened by EMILYN. SUE and BARBARA stand behind her. They find WALTER, alone on the bed, blinking awake. 
MARK BING'S HOUSE - NIGHT An upper-class home built in the international style of fieldstone and gray-stained wood. The house is set back from the road, surrounded by trees, with a pool in the back. A herd of parked cars and throbbing music indicate MARK's party is at full tilt. 
INT. MARK BING'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON -- a 36-INCH TV playing psychedelic music videos and Japanese anima. WIDEN -- to reveal a DANCING'CROWD in a dimly lit, split- level living room with exposed wooden beams. There's a large, roaring fireplace and a Jackson Pollock splatter PAINTING hangs opposite. Sliding glass doors overlook the backyard patio and swimming pool. CHUCK cuts through, sees someone jostle a table lamp. 
CHUCK Careful! Don't break anything, or Mark'll have my head on,a plate. 
EXT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
MONICA leads RACHEL up the walkway to the front door where a BEEFY BOY plays doorman. ARNIE and two geeky YOUNGER BOYS mill outside the door, trying their damndest to look cool. 
ARNIE Hey, Monica, can ya get us into the party? 
MONICA Sure, Arnie, wait here. I'll come back for ya.. . And she waltzes past him. 
MONICA (CONT'D) . in two or three years. ARNIE points at a passing RACHEL. 
APISI E How come she gets to go in? 
MONICA (rais6s a toast) To new friends. They raise their glasses and RACHEL joins in with a hesitant smile. Their glasses clink together for the... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
JESSE crosses the near empty lot, hair wet from his shower. He stops dead. 
JESSE Damn it. Under a pool of lamplight -- HIS CAR has had its tires slashed and someone has sprayed in red Carlin uies!â across the door. TRACY pulls up in. her BMW, wearing her cheerleading outfit. 
TRACY Oh, wow, that sucks. Further proof Carlin guys are gravy sucking pigs. 
JESSE Yeah. 
TRACY Need a ride? 
JESSE You goin' to Mark's? 
TRACY Wouldn't miss it. Hop in. As he gets into her car, TRACY has one hand on the wheel, the other hanging out her window. She drops something as JESSE closes the door. REVEAL a CAN of red spray paint TRACY dropped onto the parking lot's tarmac. 
TRACY Just a quick stop at my house, want to change my outfit. Her car pulls off... 
WIPING THE FRAME TO, 
INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
RACHEL and MONICA chat with AMY and two other PATIO GIRLS. AMY takes RACHEL 's hand. 
AMY I really like your nail color. 
MONICA Check out the tattoo on her arm wild huh? 
AMY Yeah. Did that hurt? 
RACHEL No. Well, yeah, actually some. 
AMY Oh, it's just too cool. 
MONICA I'm dying to get one, but my mom would have a shit fit. 
CHUCK How many points was she? 
BRAD Four. But maybe he shoulda lost those when she offed herself. 
MARK Rach, look under Jesses's name, how many points you get? 
MONICA 
(CHEERLEADING) Two, four, six, eight-- 
AMY Who do we appreciate! RACHEL looks down JESSES's column sees-her name with thirty points next to it, then, above hers, sees TRACY with ten. 
MARK No, more than that, remember, we thought Rach was a dyke. He got extra-points for the conversion. 
BRAD points? Try thirty. RACHEL stares at the book, stunned, trying to make sense of it. 
MONICA Look at her face, this is priceless. At the front door, JESSE walks in, TRACY behind him. He looks around, hasn't seen what's going on yet. ERIC intercepts him, turning JESSE away from the TV. 
ERIC Hey, man, what did the scout say? Behind Rte... THE TV SET -- between shots of players grunting, tackling and smashing into each other, longer and longer segments appear of... 
A COUPLE MAKING LOVE -- from the waist up, with thick scan lines that almost make it look surreal. It's obvious that the girl is RACHEL, and the boy is JESSE. DANCING KIDS notice what's on the TV and start to point and laugh at the set. RACHEL is completely unaware of what's going on behind her. 
MARK See, we didn't think Jess could do i so he offered to get evidence, proof that he'd scored you. 
MONICA Here comes Jesse's big play! 
MARK Lookie, lookie, Rachel. RACHEL realizes people are watching something behind her, then laughing at her. She turns and sees... The IMAGES of her and JESSE on the TV. Her face goes slack with horror. 
RACHEL Oh, God MARK leans in to RACHEL, who hasn't noticed JESSE. 
MARK Jess was disappointed with the picture quality, but I told him it was better than Pam and Tommy Lee's tape. 
CK Rach, was it good for you too? Sure looks like it, don't it? 
MARK Why don't we ask Jesse? He turns and calls out. 
MARK (CONT'D) Hey, Jesse! Over here! JESSE looks over and his eyes meet RACHEL's, but she just stares back, horrified. Then he sees the TV set behind her 
JESSE What... JESSE pushes his way through the crowd, trying to get to RACHEL. TRACY throws an arm around him, kisses his neck. 
TRACY He told me he was thinking of me when he fucked you. 
Seeing MARK laughing, JESSE realizes what's going on. 
JESSE Rachel... He tries to shrug off TRACY, but ERIC and CHUCK grab his arms and pull him back into the crowd. 
JESSE Rachel! MARK pushes RACHEL towards BRAD. 
MARK Rachel! Rachel! She tries to get away, but BRAD pushes her into MONICA who shoves her to AMY as they join in the chanting. Rachel! 
MONICA Rachel! Rachel! Drowning out JESSE's cries. RACHEL's P.Q.V. -- spinning around. A NIGHTMARISH GALLERY of dancing, jostling torsos, TWISTED FACES and LAUGHING MOUTHS, smirking and pointing at her. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
FAST CLOSE-UPS of RACHEL and JESSE making love. The assault of music, chanting and images crescendo with... BRAD grabbing RACHEL's bare arm below her HEART-THORN TATTOO forcing her to face the TV screen. 
BRAD Hey, is that a zit on your ass? RACHEL has tears streaming down her face for the first time since she was four years old. She bows her head. 
A LAUGHING BRAD glances down at RACHEL's arm. The THORN VINE around the HEART TATTOO looks bigger, edging up her arm. He looks away, shares a laugh with MARK, looks back and... 
THE HEART TATTOO on RACHEL's upper arm is growing, etched from within, the thorn covered vine snaking like a tendril up her arm. 
His eyes widen as the life is squeezed from him and he sees RACHEL standing over him. He gropes for the shotgun again... and finally grabs it. RACHEL looks at the rifle and it flies from his hold, splashing into the pool. But she jolts on two... 
GUNSHOTS RACHEL looks down. MARK had pulled the handgun from his belt with his pinned hand and fired. She's holding her belly, gutshot, staggers and falls into the pool, disappearing amid a swirl of blood. MARK yanks the hose from his neck as it goes slack. He gasps, points the gun into the pool and FIRES until it's silent and he's left pulling the trigger on empty chambers. He gets his breatking under control, leans over to look into the water of the deep end. He Aar on the sound of a mechanical whirring, and turns. A POOL COVER starts to unfold. At that moment... 
RACHEL'S BLOODY ARM bursts from the water and grips his neck. MARK grabs her forearm as her other arm yanks him into the pool. 
UNDERWATER -- As RACHEL drags MARK down, he kicks and pummels her, but she holds on. The POOL COVER steadily closes over them, shutting out the light from above. MARK finally frees himself and lunges for the surface, but the POOL COVER blocks his escape. He desperately pushes at it, eyes bulging, lungs burning, as his feet kick to keep him afloat. 
ON THE SURFACE -- The POOL COYER closing as RACHEI, hauls herself from the water, barely making it out. MARK'S HAND, grabs her leg, slides, then clutches at the edge of the pool. His fingers slip under as the cover completely shuts. 
M RX's head bulges the POOL COVER, then his hands punch feebly at it a few times. Then... nothing. 
BARBARA (O.S.) Rachel! A weakened RACHEL lays by the pool. She seems to be snapping out of her trance as she rolls over and sees BARBARA. RACHEL shudders and suddenly just looks like a wet, scared little girl reaching for her mother. 
RACHEL Mama. Maury? BARBARA'S P.O.V. o but it's a FOUR-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, pristine, without tattoos. BARBARA blinks and her P.O.V. is of a TEN-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, reaching for her. Mama, please. BARBARA blinks and it's now... The 17-YEAR-OLD RACHEL, covered in blood and tattoos. She looks her daughter in the eyes, backs away in terror. 
BARBARA What are you? You're not my little girl. No. The devil's in you. 
RACHEL 
(CRYING) Don't leave me, mama. But her mother disappears into the shadows. 
RACHEL Please, I don't have... anyone. She rolls onto her back, looks up at the STARRY NIGHT. 
RACHEL Please, God, let me die... And she tightly shuts her eyes. 
DISSOLVE BACK TO: 
THE LIVING ROOM A vision of hell -- crimson-stained walls and piled bodies. The fire is spreading, licking its way across the burning SCOREBOARD NOTEBOOK, and along the floor toward... JESSE, in pain, still pinned to the wall. He raises his head and starts in fear as... o the center of the room, facing him. He sees the gunshot wounds in her stomach, then follows her gaze to... 
THE TV SET with a cracked screen, but still playing the tape of their intimate moment at the cabin, with a sleeping RACHEL laying 
ON JESS He looks back at her. 
JESSE Rachel, listen. I swear, d know they were taping us. d never hurt you. She looks at his pleading eyes. 
JESSE 
I LOVE-- The TV SET now has the video footage of... 
INT. THE CABIN - NIGHT 
JESSE looks at RACHEL clinging to him, asleep, peaceful. He gently runs his fingers across her brow. 
JESSE 
(SOFTLY) I love you . And oulls her closer. 
HACK TO -- - RACHEL staring at the TV. And the VCR rewinds and replays.. ON TV -- the moment of JESSE saying 'I love you" to her while she was asleep. 
RACHEL falls to her knees, tears running down her face. She turns back to JESSE, amazed. A BLAZING CHUNK of ceiling falls near her. 
JESSE 
(COUGHS) Rachel. Gat out, now. Go. And the KNIFE and the CORKSCREW drop away, releasing him. He falls to the floor, drags himself over... and takes RACHEL in his arms. He cradles her. She whispers and he bends over to hear. She whispers again... 
RACHEL .love you. JESSE tenderly kisses her lips. And all the TATTOOS fade from her face and body Love. Her face is serene. JESSE traces his fingers across her brow, embraces her, the flames start to encircle them, just like in RACHEL's nightmare. JESSE pulls RACHEL over the debris ridden floor toward the back windows, but stumbles and goes down. Her eyes flutter open. 
RACHEL Leave. Get out Instead of leaving her, JESSE hugs RACHEL closer. The sleeve of his jacket catches flames. And he accepts his fate. RACHEL shuts her eyes, gives one last TELEKINETIC PUSH... 
EXT. THE BACKYARD - NIGHT

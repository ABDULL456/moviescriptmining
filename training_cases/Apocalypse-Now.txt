December 3, 1975. 
1  PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN 
It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago. 
Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface; then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, in a psychedelic  hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier beneath has  exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely. 
Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance. We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears. As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted in a paisley design. 
Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes. ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW. Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching. 
The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out with AUTOMATIC FIRE. 
Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn, screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed. Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved; they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else. They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns. They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US as they move. 
The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE. 
We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him, only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is frightened. 
An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the dead. 
OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame, bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud, electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK : 
MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW 
2  TITLE SEQUENCE 
The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying; transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely look at, like the sun itself. 
Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more distant. The TITLES CONTINUE. 
We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the MUSIC  now. 
We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds, as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE. 
We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds, close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere; CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California; Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like shapes of : 
3  EXT. MARINA DEL REY 
The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day. 
It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the head of a large American Corporation, and this is his party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war paint. Charlie is going on and on : 
CHARLIE ... It's crazy -- sugar is up to 200 dollars a ton -- sugar ! 
LAWYER What about oil ? 
CHARLIE Food, oil --look, let me show you something. This is the economy of the United States in two years -- 
He takes a newspaper, draws a circle. 
CHARLIE (continuing) This is West Germany. (he draws another, bigger circle) This is Japan. (another , bigger) This is Italy. (a dot) This is Iran. (a very big circle) And this is Saudi Arabia... In two years ? (a gigantic circle) Do you understand ? 
ACCOUNTANT What's to prevent it ? 
CHARLIE Maybe nothing. But I'll tell you, I didn't build a two-billion-dollar company in the last twenty years by doing nothing. We can protect our interests. (pause, for a drink) We are still the most powerful nation in the world. Militarily. 
He leans to his associates, in a half-whisper. 
CHARLIE (continuing) You know bodyguard; he was a captain in Viet Nam. You talk to him, except he won't talk. This kind of man can kill you with his pinky. A nice quiet fella, though. 
The VIEW BEGINS TO PULL AWAY from this group. 
CHARLIE (continuing) Carries a attache case at all times. You know what's in it ? (another sip) An Ingram Machine pistol. 
Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it : 
CHARLIE					WILLARD (V.O.) I don't tahe chances, and			Bullshit. You can kill neither should this country.			with the ridge of your If we're strong, we should			hand to the throat; you protect our interests, and			can crush a skull with we should have the respect			your knee... but you of the world, even if it				can't kill anybody with takes another war.				your pinky. 
The VIEW MOVE ALONG the guests of this small party : Pictures being taken, some people are swimming. It is the good life. Now WILLARD'S VOICE TRACK DOMINATES. 
WILLARD (V.O.) The attache case has been empty for three years, but it makes him safe to think there's a machine pistol in it. 
I don't like automatic weapons. They jam. 
I saw a friend of mine get ripped open because he flicked his M-16 to automatic, and it jammed. How much money did the contractors make on the M-16 ? 
Our VIEW IS MOVING through the people on the boat; some reading, flirting, drinking. 
WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) He likes to hear stories about Nam. I tell him I can't; they're not cleared. The truth is he wouldn't understand. 
We can now SEE A MAN with his BACK TO US, looking the opposite way. An attache case resting near to him. We MOVE CLOSER. 
WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) There's no way I can tell them... what really happened over there. 
I wouldn't've believed it if someone'd told me. 
We are now RESTING on his back. Occasionally, he sips from a beer, but we cannot see his face. 
The boat slams through the heavy sea ; hurtling off the top of a wave and crashing full into the trough of another. 
15  MED. SHOT - BOAT COCKPIT - WILLARD AND CHIEF 
Willard holds on to whatever he can -- he looks very pale. Water crashes over the bow and drenches everyone. The Chief mans the wheel and the ENGINES WHINE. Lance climbs back from his position. He looks at Willard, who just stares ahead into space, swallowing. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
16  LONG SHOT - BOAT DUSK 
The dusk is spectacular through the broken storm clouds -- the sea is calm again. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
17  VIEW ON THE BOAT - PROCEEDING UP THE COAST 
The Chief is at the helm -- Willard approaches him. 
CHIEF The Delta closes off to us about ten  miles out of Hau Fat. We'll be able to pick up some supplies -- bit I think there are only two points we can draw enough water to get into the Nung River. It's all Charlie's turf from there on out. 
WILLARD We're gonna have some help to get in the river. You know these waters, Chief ? 
CHIEF 'Bout six months ago I took a man up to Lo Mung Bridge. He was regular Army too. Shot himself in the head. I brought his body back down. 
WILLARD Shot himself. What for ? 
CHIEF Beats me -- the sun was too much for him, or the mud. Who knows ? 
Pause, looking at Willard. 
18  CLOSE SHOT - ON WILLARD 
Suddenly, his attention is diverted -- there is a slow buffeting, as if the air around them is being sucked out and replaced quickly. The boat shakes slightly. There is a distant ROLLING NOISE like interrupted thunder. All the men have stopped whatever they're doing -- stand up and look out toward the shore and the green jungle hills beyond. The buffeting and NOISE CONTINUES -- they all stand silently -- suddenly it stops. 
WILLARD Arch light. 
CHEF I hate that -- Every time I hear that noise something terrible happens. 
CHIEF Anybody see some smoke ? 
CLEAN Too far inland. 
LANCE There they are. 
He points up to the sky. 
19 FULL SHOT - ON THE SKY 
Way up -- past any clouds and barely discernible, we SEE the black silhouttes of four B-52 bombers, their vapor trails streaming white against the dark blue sky. 
CLEAN Charlie don't ever hear 'em. Not till it's too late -- don't have to hit you neither, concussion'll do it for a quarter mile or better. Burst your ears -- suck the air outta your lungs. 
20  FULL SHOT - BOAT - CREW 
They are looking up. Willard sits down, unconcerned. He takes out the dossier given him by ComSec. He flips through the letters and other documents. 
WILLARD (V.O.) The dossier on A detachment had letters from Kurtz' wife and the wives and families of his men. All asking where to send future mail, understanding the necessery silence due to the nature of their work -- None of the men had written home in half a year. 
Occasionally, in the b.g., we FEEL the terrifying buffeting of the distant B-52 BOMBING. 
21  CLOSE - ON WILLARD 
studying, examining a report. 
22  MONTAGE - PICTURES OF KURTZ 
Kurtz' face evolves through the various stages of his career as represented in the pictures in the dossier, as Willard reads : 
WILLARD (V.O.) Lieutenant Kurtz has shown a dedicated and well-disciplined spirit. He is a fine officer, combining military efficiency -- with a broad background in the Humanities, the Arts and Sciences ... 
Another picture of Kurtz in Germany, standing next to the 161st Petroleum Supply Group sign. 
WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... He views his military career as the dedication of his talents to bringing our values and way of life to those darker, less fortunate areas in the world. 
A SHOT of Kurtz at jump school. 
WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... I feel Captain Kurtz' request for Special Forces training is highly unusual in regard to his past humanitarian concerns, and his somewhat liberal politics, though I can see no reason to deny it. 
A CLOSE SHOT of Kurtz with Green Beret on in the Vietnam jungle. His face is blank and vacant. 
WILLARD (V.O.) (continuing) ... We feel Major Kurtz' need to bring a sense of Western culture to the backward peoples of these areas will be of use in accordance with our 'Vietnamization' programs ... 
MOVE IN TO Kurtz' empty eyes until the photograph is just a BLURRED MASS OF DOTS. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
23  EXT. HAU FAT - AN ADVANCE STAGING AREA 
WILLARD (V.O.) One day later we came to an advanced staging area along the coast. This was our last chance to pick up supplies before approaching the mouth of the Nung River. The VIEW OF THE COASTLINE leading up along the long load- ing docks at Hau Fat, an advance staging area for opera- tions "Brute Force" and "Mailed Fist." 
Everywhere are tents -- oil drums -- sandbagged bunkers -- helicopters -- tanks -- guns -- men. Nobody builds advanced staging areas like the Americans. 
As the P.B.R. approaches the docking area, Lance notices something. 
LANCE Hey. 
They look as a Chris-craft speeds by pulling a fancy water- skier who waves as he slaloms by. The men just look at one another. 
24  VIEW ON THE DOCK 
Others grab the air in front of them. With each movement their need increases by the square. 
31  FULL SHOT - PEDESTAL - GIRLS - MEN 
They crush forward starting to scream -- men fall on the wire -- the guards in the "riot control positions" forget -- the attack dogs are trampled. The mob as one surges forward onto the wire. Men scream and fall into the moat, which is filling up fast. The Agent sees this all as he has seen it before. He casually pulls the pin of a smoke grenade; the girls retreat into the copter -- he follows, then the two Green Berets. The ROTARS WHINE -- the black Playboy Huey lifts off just as the first crazed men reach it. They grab frantically for the wheels, but miss. The Huey wheels up into the blue sky, leaving them all below. 
Such are the ways of war. 
CUT TO: 
32  EXT. FULL VIEW - DAY 
The P.B.R. moving further up the primitive coastline. There are few signs of civilization; no villages, no boats -- just the overwhelming presence of the jungle. 
WILLARD (V.O.) Two days out of Hau Fat, there was nothing but us and the coastline. I felt like I had set off for the center of the earth... 
Suddenly, Chief looks out, ahead. 
CHIEF Smoke ! 
WILLARD Where ? 
They all turn. Chief points up the coast. 
33 FULL SHOT - THE COASTLINE 
A thick train of black smoke rises from the green jungle. 
WILLARD Black smoke ... secondary burning. 
The Chief grabs field glasses. 
CHIEF Yeah -- fishing village -- helicopters over there. Hueys, lots of 'em. 
WILLARD First Air Cavalry. They're the ones gonna get us into the River. 
34 FULL SHOT - THE BEACH AND VILLAGE 
A vast field of devastation -- smashed and smoking palm trees -- deep, ragged craters -- gutted and burning huts -- shattered sampans and bodies washing around in the surf. 
35  MED. SHOT - BEACH - WILLARD AND CREW 
They wade through the water to the beach where they are met by a heavily armed group of men. 
Overhead jets swoop by FIRING ROCKETS, the NOISE drowning out Willard's attempt at conversation with some of the men. 
We can't hear any of the talk, but we notice that the Sergeant turns up to a particular Huey, and points to it. 
36  FULL SHOT - HELICOPTERS 
Three Hueys swoop in low -- they are heavily laden with machine guns -- rockets and loudspeakers. The two out- side copters hover, while the center copter lands, raising a lot of dust. It cuts its rotors and the other copters pull up and off to the side. Two armed soldiers jump from the doors and stand with guns ready. Then a tall, strong looking man emerges. He wears a well-cut and neatly-stretched tiger suit. It is COLONEL WILLIAM KILGORE -- tough looking, well-tanned, with a black mustache. 
He crouches over, holding his hat in the rotor wash. It is no ordinary hat but a L.A. Dodgers baseball hat. He walks out, and then stards to his full immense height and with his hands on his hips he surveys the field of battle. His eyes are obscured by mirror-fronted sunglasses. 
KILGORE (bellowing) Lieutenant: Bomb that tree line back about a hundred yards -- give me some room to breathe. 
A Lieutenant and radio man nod and rush off. 
37  CLOSE VIEW ON WILLARD 
He was not quite prepared for this. 
38  VIEW ON KILGORE 
turning to his GUARDS 
KILGORE Bring me some cards. 
GUARD Sir ? 
KILGORE Body cards, you damn fool -- cards ! 
The soldier rushes over and hands him two brand new packages of playing cards wrapped in plastic. Two other soldiers get out of the copter and walk over. They are well-tanned and carry no weapons. They seem more casual about the Colonel than anyone else. The Sergeant walks up, leading Willard, the Chief and Lance. 
WILLARD (formally) Captain B-L. Willard, sir -- 4th Recon Group -- I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence 11 Corp -- I believe you understand the nature of my mission. 
KILGORE (not looking up) Yeah -- Na Trang told me to expect you -- we'll see what we can do. Just stay out of my way till this is done, Captain. 
He cracks the plastic wrapping sharply -- takes out the deck of new cards and fans them. The Colonel strides right past Willard with no further acknowledgement. The others follow, 
39  TRACKING VIEW 
The Colonel walks through the shell-pocked field of devastation. Soldiers gather around smiling; as Kilgore comes to each V.C. corpse he drops a playing card on it -- carefully picking out which card he uses. 
KILGORE (to himself) Six a spades -- eight a hearts -- Isn't one worth a Jack in this whole place. 
The Colonel goes on about this business. 
40  TRACKING ON KILGORE 
moving through the corpses, dropping the cards. 
On of the two tanned soldiers rushes up and whispers something to him. He stops. 
KILGORE What ? Here. You sure? 
The soldier points to Lance, who immediately puts down the card he was holding. Kilgore strides over to the young man, who almost instinctively moves closer t Willard. 
KILGORE (continuing) What's your name, sailor ? 
KILGORE Haven't got time, Hell's Angels -- lay it right up the tree line. 
65  FULL SHOT - JET SQUADRON 
Four F-4H Phantoms peel off and streak toward the coast. 
66  INT. COMMAND COPTER - VIEW ON WILLARD AND KILGORE 
KILGORE Fucking savages. WILLARD Who? KILGORE The enemy. Who else? 
67  HELICOPTER'S POV - THE JETS 
The jets streak by below laying in huge gobs of orange napalm along the trees. 
KILGORE (O.S.) (on radio) Very good, Hell's Angels -- suggest you follow with cannon fire. 
68  INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT 
They circle the battle. 
RADIO (V.O.) This is Baker Delta Four -- Captain hit bad -- need dust-off. Receiving heavy automatic weapons fire from huts about thirty yards to our left. 
KILGORE Big Duke Six to Baker Delta Four -- hold -- we're right over you. 
He turns to door gunner. 
KILGORE (continuing) Right along the doors, boy. 
The gunner FIRES leaning out -- 
KILGORE (continuing) Fine... fine... little higher. Through the roof; yeah, that's good. 
He leans back in. 
KILGORE (continuing) Didn't anybody bring me any bombs, grenades, claymores or anything? 
LIEUTENANT You didn't tell me to, sir. 
KILGORE (grumbling) You shoulda known. 
Suddenly, BULLETS SMASH through the copter -- Plexiglass SHATTERS; the copter vibrates and turns sharply. Kilgore is thrown down where he hangs on. 
KILGORE (continuing) Sonuvabitch -- anybody hurt? 
WILLARD Automatic weapons flashes along those trees -- probably eleven millimeter guns and AK-47's. 
KILGORE The trees, eh... 
He grabs the R.T. 
KILGORE (continuing) Eagle Thrust Four -- Big Duke Six. Join me in sparaying some trees. 
RADIO (V.O.) Affirmative, Big Duke Six -- We're even got some rockets left. 
KILGORE Take her in low, Lieutenant. 
69  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, HELICOPTERS 
The two helicopters swoop up out of the smoke and blast the trees with ROCKETS, MACHINE GUNS and GRENADE LAUNCHERS. 
Other copters join -- The V.C. break and run through the rice paddies in the f.g. -- BULLETS EXPLODING around them -- they scream and fall FIRING back. 
70 INT. COMMAND COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD 
Kilgore looks out as three V.C. break and run through the rice paddies -- the helicopter turns and follows them -- the door gunner swings out and BLASTS two of them into the mud. He takes a bead on the third. 
KILGORE Hold it, boy. 
He puts his arms across the sights -- the gunner swings back inside. 
KILGORE (continuing) Take her up to 300 feet, Lieutenant. 
They rise above the paddy -- the man below runs for all he's worth. Kilgore motions to the door gunner who steps aside. Kilgore buckles himself into the gunner's harness. 
KILGORE (continuing) Rifle. 
A hand passes him a M-16. 
KILGORE (continuing; hard) My rifle, soldier. 
There is some fumbling and then a hand passes him a 300 Weatherby Magnum with a zebra wood stock -- mother of pearl inlays and a variable power scope. Kilgore takes it and opens the bolt. 
71  VIEW ON WILLARD 
Amazed at these proceedings. 
72  VIEW ON KILGORE 
as he loads the rifle with huge cartridges. He gets into the sling and slams the bolt shut. 
73  MOVING POV. ON THE V.C. 
He is running hard, but starting to sink into the mud. The Huey DRONES overhead, its huge shadow behind him on the mud. He turns and FIRES with a pistol. 
74  INT. COPTER - MED. SHOT - KILGORE, WILLARD 
Kilgore leans out; pulls the gun in tight -- takes careful aim and the Cong is BLASTED flat into the paddy. Kilgore leans back, opens the bolt, ejecting the spent cartridge out the door. He hands Weatherby back into the copter. 
75  VIEW ON WILLARD 
They walk through shallows carrying brightly colored boards. They look very scared. JETS SCREAM overhead, FIRING CANNONS. Helicopters wheel by carrying out wounded. 
They wear olive drab surfing trunks with the Cav's shield on the left leg. The same shield is emblazoned on the boards along the word "Airmobile". They edge into the water and paddle through the mild shorebreak. 
82  FULL SHOT - THE POINT - SURFERS 
They paddle up the point in the calm channel -- the beautiful waves breaking beyond them. 
83  CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY, MIKE 
They paddle on their stomachs, keeping low -- breathing hard and constantly looking around scared out of their minds. 
84  MED. SHOT - KILGORE AND LANCE 
Kilgore looks at them with his field glasses. Lance kind of sits below taking cover in a shell hole. 
KILGORE They far enough? 
LANCE Sure -- fine -- 
Kilgore turns and takes a giant electric megaphone from a waiting lackey. 
KILGORE (through megaphone) That's far enough -- pick one up and come on in -- 
85  FULL SHOT - THE POINT, SURFERS 
They line themselves up on the point. A good set is building. Mike turns strokes into it -- takes off -- drops to the bottom and turns -- trims up into a tight section -- everything right except he keeps looking around frantically. 
86  CLOSE SHOT ON LANCE AND KILGORE 
Another SHELL SCREAMS over and EXPLODES down the beach. Lance looks over at Willard. 
LANCE (to himself) Maybe he'll get tubed. 
WILLARD What? 
LANCE Maybe he'll get inside the tube -- where -- where they can't see him. 
A SERIES of SHELLS ROAR in. WILLARD Incoming ! 
Lance ducks -- puts his hands over his head. The SHELLS SCREAM over Kilgore and out towards the point. Kilgore looks through his glasses -- two EXPLOSIONS in the water are HEARD. 
KILGORE Son of a bitch. 
Lance looks up and out toward the point in horror. 
87  FULL SHOT - THE POINT 
Two surfboards float in the channel bobbing up and down on the waves. 
88  MED. SHOT - LANCE AND KILGORE 
LANCE (to himself) The tragedy of this war is a dead surfer. 
Willard looks over, beginning to think Lance is crazy, too. 
WILLARD What's that? 
LANCE Just something I read in the Free Press. 
KILGORE They just missed a good set -- the chicken shits ! 
Lance looks up. 
89 FULL SHOT - THE POINT , SURFERS 
They come up near their boards and climb on -- smoke hangs over the water. 
KILGORE (O.S.) (megaphone) Try it again, you little bastards. 
90  BACK TO SCENE 
He turns to Willard. 
KILGORE (continuing) I´m not afraid to surf this place. I'll surf this place. 
91  CLOSE SHOT ON KILGORE 
He turns, glowering to his lackeys. 
KILGORE Bring that R.T., soldier. 
He grabs it. 
KILGORE (continuing) Big Duke Six to Hell's Angels -- Goddamit, I want that treeline bombed -- yeah -- napalm -- gimme some napalm -- son of a bitch -- yeah, I'll take H.Z. or C.B.U.'s if you got any of them -- just bomb 'em into the Stone Age, boy. 
He throws the R.T. back to a soldier -- another SALVO WHISTLES over -- everyone drops. 
KILGORE (continuing; to himself) Son of a bitch. 
As the SHELLS EXPLODES on the beach behind him, KIlgore raises his M-16 and EMPTIES it full automatic in the general direction of the trees. He mumbles a few un- intelligible swear words and jams a new clip into his rifle turning to Lance -- 
KILGORE (continuing) We'll have this place cleaned up and ready for us in a jiffy, boy. Don't you worry. 
He FIRES another clip as the JETS SCREAM overhead. 
92  FULL SHOT - RIVER - COPTERS 
A sky-crane without pod descends slowly toward us -- The P.B.R. hangs below it. 
The P.B.R. along the river shallows -- The Chief and crew waiting and yelling. 
99  MED. VIEW ON WILLARD AND LANCE 
WILLARD Are you finished surfing? 
LANCE Yeah... thanks. 
WILLARD Want to say goodbye to the Colonel? 
LANCE Nah. 
WILLARD Then let's get the hell out of here. 
They break and run like hell toward the boat in the distance. OUR VIEW TRACKS with them. They are cheered by the crew -- suddenly, Willard sees some- thing and stops... Lance continuing. In a pile of equipment that the Hueys have left are two surfboards -- Willard looks at them. 
LANCE No -- no, Captain. 
WILLARD Which one's the Colonel's? 
LANCE The Yater -- the clear one with the thin stringer. 
Willard glances over to it with determination. There is still MORTAR FIRE coming in between him and the board. Suddenly, Willard makes a run for it. 
CHIEF (O.S.) Incoming ! Incoming -- son of a bitch. 
The ROUNDS bracket the P.B.R. and line up the beach toward Willard. He stands there and doesn't move, the surfboard under his arm. The shells kick up sand. Lance has dropped. Fragments whistle by, one rips a chunk of foam and fibreglass from the rain of the board. 
WILLARD (calm) This one , Lance? 
LANCE Yeah, Jesus Christ ! 
Once again, Willard takes off fast as hell with the board under his arm. Lance follows toward the boat, through the water. Willard hands the board up to Mr. Clean, and they both scamper abroad, exhausted and relieved. 
CLEAN What'd you that for? 
WILLARD When I was a kid I, never had a Yater spoon. 
Mr. Clean stuffs the board in the stern 50 Cal. mount. The boat turns -- ENGINES RUNNING HARD and ROARS OFF toward the deeper water of the river -- the board clearly visible on the stern. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
100  FULL SHOT ON THE RIVER - P.B.R 
The P.B.R. ROARS BY going down the river at full speed. It is swerving and zig-zagging to avoid potential enemy fire. 
101  MED. SHOT ON THE CREW 
They all are in full battle positions -- their twin fifty Cal. guns turning; warily covering the jungled banks. The Chief is at helm -- Willard crouches against some armor plate, huddled with his M-16 ready. Chef is behind him at the radio. Lance leans back from his forward turret. 
LANCE (yelling) Maybe we better stay in under the trees till dark -- we got his Yater. 
WILLARD He didn't look like he'd take that sitting down. 
They all look up into the sky -- expecting the worst. 
WILLARD (continuing) Let's put some distance between us and Charlie. 
The Chief nods. 
CHIEF Lance --- LANCE Yeah. 
CHIEF Why don't you roll us a big joint? I think the Captain'd like that. 
They all look at Willard uneasily. After a suspensful pause, Willard smiles: 
WILLARD Take one a mine -- 
He fishes into his breast pocket -- pulls out a huge cigar-sized joint. They all smile -- Willard lights up. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
102  FULL SHOT - THE P.B.R. 
It zig-zags away from us down the river at high speed. 
DISSOLVE TO : 
103  FULL SHOT - THE TREES, BOAT, CREW - NIGHT 
The boat is hidden under some trees along the river bank. The men wait tensely listening -- 
LANCE You hear it again? 
WILLARD No -- I don't think so. But it'll be back. They were circling. It'll be back. 
LANCE You think he'd of shot us? 
WILLARD When? 
LANCE Any time -- us -- Americans. 
Lance looks over at Willard. 
WILLARD I don't think he´d of shot us on the beach but -- he'd of shot us if he saw me taking the board -- 
LANCE A Yater spoon is hard to get -- especially here. 
WILLARD He's a man who knows what he wants -- he does know what he wants. 
TERRI Do us a favor -- I'd do one for you -- if I could -- 
Willard just stares at her -- even though she's in jeans and field jacket she is something to see -- The Agent takes Willard aside -- Terri goes back to the others. 
AGENT Look -- you know who that is, Captain -- you know what she's saying -- you'll never see stuff that good outside of a magazine for the rest of your life. 
WILLARD I'm not that fond of blondes -- maybe I like brunettes -- 
AGENT Take your pick -- they all like you -- I can tell -- 
WILLARD I like all of them -- 
AGENT Good -- like I said, take your pick. 
WILLARD I said I like all of them. 
AGENT Now just a second -- I'm doing you a favor, buddy -- what're you trying to pull? 
Willard turns to leave again. 
WILLARD We need all our fuel anyway. 
AGENT Wait -- wait -- don't get up tight -- what I meant was we'd need a whole drum for that -- 
WILLARD Sit down -- we'll talk about it. 
Willard sits down on a metal chair -- motions the Agent to do likewise. 
AGENT What's there to talk about -- this whole thing disgusts me. 
WILLARD My men -- 
AGENT What ! 
WILLARD That's what there is to talk about -- my man -- I take a good care of my men -- 
The girls are trying to pretend they're not listening -- the helicopter Pilot is cackling to himself. 
AGENT You're out of your skull -- 
WILLARD We have a lot of pride in our unit -- 
AGENT How far do you think you can push -- what kind of people do you think -- 
WILLARD Esprit de corps -- AGENT No -- absolutely not -- 
WILLARD One for all -- all for one -- 
AGENT You can keep your fucking fuel -- 
Willard gets up. 
WILLARD You make some of your closest friends in the army -- war has a way of bringing men together. 
AGENT Get out -- 
WILLARD Men of all races -- nationalities -- 
He gets up and starts out. 
AGENT Two drums -- 
Willard turns around slowly. 
AGENT (continuing) Two whole drums -- 
WILLARD We can use some fifty caliber and a 16 too -- 
AGENT I don't know what you're talking about -- Get fucked -- 
WILLARD I will -- I assure you that -- You got a fifty on that H-34 -- leave the ammo in boxes -- I'll get my men to bring the first drum with 'em -- 
He turns to go under the tent flap. 
WILLARD (continuing) Have the girls freshen up a bit -- comb their hair -- put on something -- you know what I mean -- 
He leaves. 
123  FULL SHOT - P.B.R. - CREW 
They are all working on patching the boat and cleaning it up in general. Mr. Clean sits in f.g., cleaning an M-16. 
CLEAN You keep this thing in this condition an' it's gonna jam, Lance -- mark my words. 
LANCE Why don't you go pet the water buffaloes -- get off my back. 
Behins them on the beach stand several water buffaloes eating mud or whatever they do. They are painted jungle brown and green camouflage with grey bottoms -- on their sides the words have been stenciled in black: 1 Each -- Buffalo, Water B-1A U.S. Army No. 15239 
Willard walks through them down to the boat. 
CHIEF Careful,  Captain, they've been known to charge. 
WILLARD All right I got a little surprise for you -- 
They all look up. 
WILLARD (continuing) I've arranged with those people we saw at Hau Fat to give us some 50 caliber in trade for a couple a drums of fuel -- 
CHEF No shit. 
LIEUTENANT I'd just clear out as soon as I could if I were you, sir. They're gonna start working on the bridge with torches again. Charlie will start throwing it in hard -- 
WILLARD What is this bridge? 
LIEUTENANT It's of strategic importance for keeping the highway into Bat Shan open -- the generals don't like to admit that Bat Shan is surrounded. 
He points to the men getting ready to work. 
LIEUTENANT (continuing) Every night we build it and by 0800 they've blown it up -- it and a lot of good men -- But the generals like to say the road is open -- ha ! Nobody uses that road except Charlie. 
He turns and splashes off into the darkness. 
LIEUTENANT (continuing) This is the cesspool of hell. 
SOLDIER (O.S.) Incoming. 
SHELLS WHISTLE OVER and CRASH into the bridge -- MEN SCREAM in the distance -- the EXPLOSIONS are thunderous. 
CHIEF (yelling) All right -- Lance, go with the Captain an' see what you can scrounge -- 
Willard climbs out with Lance. 
CHIEF (continuing; to Willard) Better make it fast, sir -- we don't really need much anyway. 
Willard nods and they scurry off the bank under the bridge. 
129  MED. SHOT - WILLARD, LANCE 
They dash up the embankment and along the barbed wire on the edge of the road. SHELLS SCREAM overhead, they don't know where to run. 
VOICE Straight ahead, son of a bitch. 
They dive towards the voice. 
130  CLOSE SHOT - TRENCH 
They dive in, a SOLDIER is crounched in f.g. holding his buddy who is crying uncontrollably. 
SOLDIER You came right to it, son of a bitch -- 
WILLARD Son of a bitch, sir. 
The Soldier doesn't respond. 
WILLARD (continuing) Where's your chief supply officer? 
SOLDIER Beverly Hills -- 
WILLARD What? 
SOLDIER Straight up the road -- a concrete bunker -- Beverly Hills -- where else you think he'd be? 
WILLARD C'mon -- 
There is an apparent lull and they dash out along the road. Suddenly to their right an M-60 STARTS OPENING UP from a sandbagged emplacement. 
SOLDIER (O.S.) Get your asses down, buddy. 
They drop and crawl to the slit trench and run up to the emplacement. Several SOLDIERS man a M-60. One has a sniper rifle -- another tries to spot for the Gunner. Willard and Lance edge up along the trench. Willard trips. 
VOICE Watch your feet, asshole -- 
Willard looks down. 
VOICE (continuing) You stepped on my face. 
LANCE We thought you were dead. 
VOICE The whole world loves a smart ass. 
They move ahead more carefully. The Gunner BLASTS away into the night, there is a pile of brass cases about three feet high next to him. Finally he stops swearing to himself. 
WILLARD What're you shooting at, soldier? 
GUNNER Gooks. 
He turns and sees it's an officer. 
GUNNER (continuing) I´m sorry, sir. 
WILLARD It's all right, sergeant -- what's out there? 
GUNNER They were tryin' to cut through the wire -- I got 'em all I think. 
OTHER SOLDIER Oh yeah -- listen. 
There is a low moaning SCREAM from out in the wire -- it stops for aminute then continues hideously. 
GUNNER He's trying to call his friends -- send up a flare. 
The Spotter does, it arcs up, then bathes them in eerie light. The Gunner FIRES a long BURST. 
SPOTTER Those are all dead, stupid, he's obviously underneath 'em -- 
They think about this as the flare goes out. The SCREAMING gets more intense. 
GUNNER Wake up the Roach. 
The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are the words: "GOD BLESS DOW." 
The river is moving fast against them. all manner of de- bris; tree trunks, sweeping by the P.B.R. 
CHIEF (to Willard) I can't see a fucking thing. 
There is a loud CRACKING SOUND, as one of the pieces of tree- trunk whacks the hull, and bounces off. Willard climbs forward, and looks down. 
CHIEF (continuing) We hit a big enough one this hull will shatter like a Corvette. Fucking plastic boat. 
Willard practically hangs off forward with a long pole, warding off the big debris moving toward the P.B.R. Clean joins him, helping. 
WILLARD (shouting to Chief) What about ducking into one of those tributaries till this river slows down? 
CHIEF Who knows what's up there? 
WILLARD Can't be any worse than this. What do you think? 
CHIEF I think this river wants to take us home fast. I'm practically goin' in reverse. 
Willard points his pole in the direction of the mouth of a tributary. 
WILLARD Well, get in there. 
CHIEF This whole area is lousy with V.C. -- We don't stand a chance. Lemme turn around and we'll be in Hau Fat in six minutes. 
There is a really loud WHACK against the hull. willard really mad, throws the pole at the Chief, who ducks. 
WILLARD Get in there ! 
CHIEF This is my crew and my fucking boat, and I'm the responsible party. 
WILLARD Get in there now or I'll bury you in this river. 
It's clear that Willard will kill the Chief if he doesn't do as he says. 
CHIEF (finally relents, turns the helm) You're fucking crazy. You're going to get us all killed. 
The P.B.R. navigates through the rush and into the mouth of the tributary.

CHEF I know it sounds stupid, but I feel like the goddamn jungle's watching us. 
WILLARD Probably is. 
CHEF Whatdoya think it thinks. 
WILLARD That we're dumber than we look. 
Chef stops again, looks hard, trying to penetrate the darkness and from the very depth of it -- the darkness of it, comes a stream of tracers, lazily arching out at them. It whips between them -- the SOUND FOLLOWING much later. 
Other BULLETS SMASH through and ricochet off the deck fittings. GLASS SHATTERS, and a huge hunk of paint is removed from the armor shield by a 20 mm cannon. 
CHIEF Lance -- 'bout twenty meters starboard. 
Lance leaps down to his position. Willard, Clean and Chef cut feverishly, as the trapped boat struggles to get free. 
CHEF There in the trees ! 
Everything is confusion -- yelling -- GUNFIRE -- the THUD of heavy BULLETS ripping inti the P.B.R.'s fibreglass hull.

WILLARD Watch it ! 
They duck as SHOTS RING OUT from the dock, stitching the water across the P.B.R.'s bow. The crew crouches, guns trained on the dock as the boat still approaches. 
WILLARD (continuing) They're not Cong. 
CHIEF (over the loud-hailer) We're Americans. 
Another BURST, closer. 
CHEF Maybe you shouldn't say we're Americans? 
Willard stares at the dock and building, trying to figure it out. 
WILLARD Chef, try your French. 
Chief hands the loud-hailer to Chef, who shrugs and shouts: 
CHEF Nous sommes Americains -- 
Silence. 
CHEF (continuing) Nous ne voulon pas vous agresser.

Gradually, a small group appears from behind the drums on the dock. 
WILLARD (O.S.) French Nationals -- they may not be too friendly, though. 
159  BACK TO SCENE 
We drift closer to the dock. The Chef starts enjoying speaking French. 
CHEF Nous sommes Americains -- nous sommes des amis -- 
There is silence as the boat drifts closer. Then: 
FRENCHMAN (shouting out) Vous parlez Francais comme une vache espanole. 
CHEF (to himself) I thought it was pretty good, myself. 
CHIEF What'd he say? 
CHEF Said I speak French like a Spanish cow. 
FRENCHMAN (O.S.) Laisser tomber vos armes -- 
CHEF Put the guns straight up -- stand away from the mounts. 
WILLARD Do it. 
They do. 
FRENCHMAN (O.S.) Vous pouvez approcher mais doucement -- 
CHEF Take her in slow. 
160  FULL SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - DOCK 
The men on the dock move forward, cautiously. They are a young man, PHILIPPE, about 25, strong and handsome, save for a scar down on the side of his face and through his left eye, which is covered by a patch. He is dressed in a tiger suit and the red beret of the French colonial para- troops. Also of the red beret are HENRY LeFEVRE, a bear- ded, dark-looking man of 35, and TRAN VAN KAC, a middle- aged half-breed slave. They all bear automatic weapons and suspicious in their eyes. As the boat pulls up to the dock, another Frenchman joins the group, obviously the head man, GASTON De MARAIS, about fifty, small and deli- cate, with a strength about him. 
PHILIPPE Hands on the heads. 
CHIEF I can't steer with my goddamn feet. 
CHEF Hey, they speak American. 
GASTON Who is the commanding officer? 
CHIEF I -- 
WILLARD I am -- I'm Captain B.L. Willard. This is Chief Warrant Officer Phillips -- it's his boat. We were shot up bad downriver and need repairs and food -- we can pay you in gold. 
165  INT. WORKMEN'S SHOWER - EVENING 
A foreman's shower from the old plantation days. The Chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted. Lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy, caked with blood. His reaction is odd; rather than just stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened, reluctant to step in. Chef is waiting behind him. 
CHEF A hot shower, hot damn. 
He pushes him forward into the water. The dirt and caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a shower is.

167  INT. WILLARD'S QUARTERS - EVENING 
A beautiful European room with tall ceilings. Still elegantly furnished, although old and decaying. 
Willard sits in a comfortable chair in the corner of the room, looking out over the carpet,  the bed with its elegant spread; the wash basin; the bidet. His battle dress is black with muck, with bloodstaines and burns. 
He rises from the chair and steps to a dresser above which is a large mirror. There is an album on the marble top of the dresser. He turns to a page at random.

Some old photographs of people standing around a car in the 20's in front of the plantation. Another picture shows a child playing by the rubber trees near the plantation.

174  INT. DINING ROOM GROUP - TRACKING SHOT 
TRACK DOWN the long table, covered with delicious food. The P.B.R. crew sits with others of the De Marais group. The table is headed by St. LeFevre. Chef's face lights up as he regards the wonderful European-style food. 
CHEF This food is wonderful ! I can't believe the chef is a slope. (turning to Clean) Some more? 
Opposite the table, sitting next to the Chief, Lance reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands. 
CHEF (continuing) Hey -- Lance. 
LANCE Huh? Oh. Um, wouldya .. wouldya pass me the Rice-a-roni, please. 
And then he looks to his friends for approval. 
Our VIEW REVEALS that behind a transparent silk curtain there is another, more elaborate table, where the De Marais family is dining with Willard. Our VIEW MOVES through the curtain and settles in a MEDIUM VIEW of the group. 
The men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room. Willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair next to him. 
GASTON Roxanne, I hope you are feeling better. 
ROXANNE Je vais bien maintenant. 
GASTON May I present Captain Willard? He is of a paratroop regiment. You know the difference between a paratrooper and a regular soldier, don't you , my dear? 
ROXANNE (smiling and taking Willard's hand) Yes, they come from the sky. 
She sits -- there's an uneasy silence. 
Willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. He is forced to face toward Gaston, and drawn to look at Roxanne. 
WILLARD I would like to know more about the .. uh, plaque... 
Philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted wooden plaque with various tallies on it. 
GASTON Attacks repulsed, as I was saying. (hard) This is only  for this war, Captain. Viet Cong -- 54; North Vietnamese regular forces -- 15; South Vietnamese -- 28 -- regular forces and otherwise. (pause) Americain -- 6. Of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, Captain. 
WILLARD Of course. I -- Once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here. 
GASTON Captain? 
WILLARD You'll get blown outta here some day. 
GASTON We will never 'evacuate', Captain -- this is our home. Indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty-one years, there is something to say for that. 
WILLARD The Vietnamese think it's theirs -- I guess the Americans do, too. 
ROXANNE (from the sitting room) Are you warm, Captain? 
WILLARD The river is beautiful. 
In fact, we REALIZE that he is checking the boat.

It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over it. The windows also have netting and barbed wire -- there is a .30 calibre machine gun mount in the far one. He look around. she goes over to the bed, and turns down the sheets. Then she slips out of her dress and stands there facing him. 
He puts down his gun and strips off his shirt. She lays down on the bed and watches him. 
ROXANNE I have been lonely here, Captain. 
He moves to her, slipping into the bed. M-16 is leaning against the wall in his reach. 
FADE OUT. 
183  EXT. ROXANNE'S TERRACE - NIGHT 
We can VIEW into the room, as Willard has silently slipped out of her bed, and is a dark sinister figure kneeling in final preparations for going out in the night. 
Without a sound, he comes out to the terrace, and scales down the wall of the old building, disappearing into the darkness.

Two Vietnamese guard the P.B.R. -- suddenly, feet first, the first disappears into the thicket.

He sleeps soundly alone in the bed - we HEAR SOMEONE moving around in the room. He wakes suddenly -- PULL BACK TO REVEAL Roxanne combing her hair and buttoning up her blouse. She notices he is awake and smiles. 
ROXANNE I will fix you breakfast. 
He starts to get up. 
WILLARD I'm afraid I won't have time -- I gotta -- 
ROXANNE Whe you reach the boat you will find that half your fifty calibre stores -- a case of grenades, a mortar and two M-16's and a case of clips are being transfered to us by your order. 
He stops -- seemingly stunned. 
WILLARD So that's it. 
ROXANNE You may think what you wish, Captain, but I like you very much. 
She turns to go. 
WILLARD What if I say no. 
ROXANNE Then Philippe will have to kill all of you. 
She leaves.

He walks down onto the dock. Gaston's men are transferring ammunition boxes. 
Gaston is standing with Philippe, who are covering the Chief and crew with M-16's. 
GASTON Two of my men deserted last night. It happens from time to time. I assume my daughter told you of our conditions. 
CHIEF Signs? 
WILLARD Yeah -- like keep out -- 
Willard motions -- the Chief accelerates -- they move ahead past the smoking mound. 
198  EXT. THE RIVER - FOG - DAY 
The P.B.R. pushed deeper into this mysterious area. Mist swells in and around the river, as the boat moves into an obscure fog. The Chief cuts the engine, and they coast. 
WILLARD (V.O.) Toward the night of the fifth day out of Do Lung Bridge, we judged ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz' base. Everything was still, the trees, the creepers, even the brush seemed like it had been changed into some kind of stone. It was unnatural, like a trance. Not a sound could be heard. I began to think I was deaf -- then the fog came suddenly, and I was blind too. 
The boat disappears in the thick fog.

WILLARD (V.O.) Two hours after the fog lifted, we moved slowly to a spot we thought was roughly a mile and a half below Kurtz's camp. We approached a long sand-bank stretching down the middle of the river. 
CHIEF Which way? Right or left? 
WILLARD Who knows? Right. 
CHIEF Looks pretty shallow. 
The P.B.R. moves toard the right-most channel. Chef takes a long pole and begins sounding depth.

WILLARD We've been attacked. 
AUSTRALIAN (shouting back) I know, I know, it's all right. Come in this way. It's mined over there. This way. It's all right. 
Willard look at Chef who is at the helm. He shrugs and they do as this man says. The P.B.R. moves towards the water's edge where there is a dock covered with concertina wire. The odd Australian stands waving his hat, guiding them safely in. 
A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub- merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the ground. Chef nods at the bodies. 
CHEF Charlie? 
WILLARD Looks that way. 
CHEF (looking at the Australian) Who's he? 
WILLARD God knows. 
The boat pulls up. The Australian harlequin hops on board; the crew regards him with their dark faces splat- tered with mud and blood. 
WILLARD (continuing) Who the hell are you? 
AUSTRALIAN Moonby. Got any Winstons? 
WILLARD Moonby what? 
AUSTRALIAN Moonby, 4th battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, Task Force. Ex-Corporal Moonby, deserted. 
WILLARD (incredulously, indicating the hundreds of natives) What is this? 
MOONBY Oh, they're simple enough people. It's good to see you, baby. Nobody has any Winstons? 
Chef automatically offers Moonby a Winston. 
MOONBY This boat's a mess. 
WILLARD Where's Kurtz? I want to talk to him. 
MOONBY Oh, you don't talk to Colonel Kurtz. (he puffs, then smiles) You listen to him. God, these are good. I kept these people off you, you know. It wasn't easy. 
WILLARD Why did they attack us? 
MOONBY Simple. They don't want him to go. 
WILLARD You're Australian? 
MOONBY Pre-Australian, actually. But I'd dig goin' to California. I'm California dreamin'. 
WILLARD (almost to himself) So Kurtz is alive. 
MOONBY Kurtz. I tell you, that man has enlarged my mind. 
He opens his arms wide, to indicate the breadth of his mind's expansion. 
MOONBY (continuing) But lemme tell you, he is the most dangerous thing in every way that I've come on so far. He wanted to shoot me. The first thing he said is, 'I'm going to shoot you because you are a deserter.' I said I didn't desert from your army, I deserted from my army. He said, 'I'm going to shoot you just the same.' 
WILLARD Why didn't he shoot you? 
MOONBY I've asked myself that question. I said to myself, why didn't he shoot me? He didn't shoot me, because I had a stash like you wouldn't believe. I hid it in the jungle; the wealth of the Orient: Marijuana -- Hashish -- Opium -- cocaine -- uncut Heroin; the Gold of the Golden Triangle. and Acid -- I make Koolaid that makes purple Owsley come on like piss. Now I'm Kurtz' own Disciple -- I listen he talks. About everything ! Everything. I forgot there's such a thing as sleep. Everything. Of love, too. 
CHEF Love?

MOONBY No, Colonel Kurtz couldn't be crazy -- if you heard him talk, just last week, you'd never think he was crazy. 
WILLARD Is that where he is? By the shrunken heads. 
MOONBY Those heads, yes. Well, the rebels... 
WILLARD (to his men) We're going ashore. Tie her up -- and leave your guns up, Lance. 
LANCE What? 
WILLARD Bring your rifles, that's all. (looking at Moonby) Take us to him. 
MOONBY Right on -- he's been waiting for -- 
WILLARD And shut up. 
Moonby nods and shrugs, and hops off the P.B.R. willard and the men follow. 
228  MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW 
As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear where a moment before there was only jungle. 
They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is, if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort, where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more primitive and more savage than any since the time of Captain Cook. 
There is a long pause,  as the two men regard each other. Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin. 
WILLARD Do you know me? 
KURTZ Yes. 
Kurtz reaches down; takes the .45 -- and without another word or gesture, shoots and kills a man. 
KURTZ (continuing) Do you know me ? 
He throws the .45 back on the dirt. Rises, and walks back into the cavernous headquarters behind the shrunken heads. Moonby scampers off after him, a respectful distance behind. Even Willard is stunned. 
CHEF Holy shit. 
237  EXT. KURTZ'S OUTPOST - FULL VIEW - TWILIGHT 
Dotted with campfires; Montagnard families -- it is like a primitive civilization. 
238  VIEW BY THE TEMPLE WALL 
Willard is alone by a campfire -- his M-16 leans by a wall next to him. He is exhausted. 
Lance sleeps by the fire, a little distance away. Chef approaches, crouches down. 
CHEF Captain -- they've been probed all this week -- Cong and NVA regulars. There's gonna be a big offense any time. 
WILLARD I know. 
Lance stirs; starts to wake up. 
CHEF What are we doing here? 
WILLARD Kurtz. I'm supposed to kill him, just like he said. 
KURTZ Yeah, I can see that. He's fuckin nuts -- 
WILLARD Yeah. 
CHEF He killed that guy without feeling anything. 
WILLARD Not a thing. 
CHEF When you kill Cong, don't you feel something. 
WILLARD Sure. (thinking) Recoil... I feel the recoil of my rifle. 
Willard rises. Chef looks at him, confused and frightened. 
239  FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE 
Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar emplacement. 
Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow to Willard as he passes. 
WILLARD This is good -- triple overlapping fields of fire -- walls so thick ordinary artillery just cleans the moss off their surfaces. 
A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then runs off to her bunker. 
WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on a big piece of almost raw meat. 
WILLARD (continuing) I've done things, when I was alone in the jungle -- that I never told anyone about. 
They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of fire into the jungle beyond. 
Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with bayonets. 
CHEF This is evil -- evil, Captain. We're all gonna die here. 
WILLARD Yeah, I know. 
CHEF I don't get it -- You said your mission was to kill him. Let's do it, an' get our asses outta here. This  Kurtz is ruining the war; I mean, this don't look good for America ! 
WILLARD (lost in his thoughts) ... he's an amazing officer. 
CHEF You got to kill this sonuvabitch -- Lance and me, we don'´t understand none of this -- Jesus, Captain -- I don't wanna die here -- Do it quick. 
Lance just stands there; his eyes vacant.. He sort of nods, sucking a joint. 
WILLARD Yeah. I know. 
He thinks. 
240  INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting. 
241  WILLARD'S VIEW 
An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head- quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards, but have now fallen into decayed disuse. 
There are other indications of the modern headquarters this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor- tant.  Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair. There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche "Nothing is true -- everything is permitted." 
Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to Willard. 
MOONBY He's asleep -- don't bother him. 
KURTZ I'm awake. 
Willard steps in closer. Kurtz looks to Moonby. 
WILLARD How did we get here? 
KURTZ Because of all the things we do, the thing we do best -- is lie. 
WILLARD I think think a lie stinks. 
KURTZ Oh Captain, that is so true. 
WILLARD Stinks. I could never figure -- (he drinks from the canteen) I could never figure how they can teach boys how to bomb villages with napalm -- and not let them write the word 'fuck' on their airplanes. 
Willard drinks more of the LSD water. 
KURTZ (angrily) You could never figure it because it doesn't make sense. 
WILLARD Fuck no. 
KURTZ I'll tell you what makes sense ! Air strikes ! White Phosphorus ! Napalm ! We'll bomb the shit out of them if they don't do what we want. 
WILLARD We'll exterminate the fuckers ! 
Chef steps into the Headquarters -- he is terrified. He draws his bayonet. 
CHEF Captain -- kill him. 
KURTZ Think of it -- for years, millions of years, savages with pathetic painted faces were scared shitless that fire would rain down from the sky. And goddamn, we made it happen. God  bless  Dow  ! 
CHEF Kill him ! 
Chef rushes at Kurtz with his bayonet -- instinctively, Willard GUNS him -- then there is additional automatic FIRE. Chef is being riddled by bullets. 
246  VIEW ON LANCE 
He has let loose with his M-16 at Chef, like some sort of mindless, programmed killer. 
LANCE (FIRING) Hot damn ! 
Then hes tops -- Chef falls to the dirt -- there is an instant of silence, then: 
247 EXT. OF THE TEMPLE AT NU MUNG BA - NIGHT 
The DOORS begin LIGHT MY FIRE , loud and overwhelming, as illuminating flares light up the blackness. 
248  MED. CLOSE VIEW 
of enormous loudspeakers protected behind spirals of razor-sharp concertina wire. LIGHT MY FIRE is blasted out to the enemy, poised to attack. 
249  ANOTHER LOUDSPEAKER 
Cannibal-painted men in savage decorations wait. Bay- onets are fixed. Men are stoned to acid, injecting speed, sniffing cocaine, eating grass, smoking hashish in water pipes. One looks up to the sky. 
250  EIS VIEW 
A rocket illuminates the sky, strobing, as in a psyche- delic hallucination. 
251  VIEW ON THE SOLDIER 
SOLDIER Wow... 
Another behind him is chanting the word NAPALM softly t himself. 
252  MED. VIEW ON THE GATE 
Willard strides out of the darkness, into the positions around the gate. He looks like a magnificent warrior -- Genghis. All the men: Montagnards, fierce Americans, even the savage men of the P.B.R. crew either bow, salute or kneel before Willard. The color pulsates around the edge of the image, red and green, mauve and purple. 
We SEE Lance; waiting, with his weapons -- garlands of teeth around his neck, his face painted. 
253  FULL VIEW - MONTAGE 
Enemy ARTILLERY BLASTING away at the fortress. 
254  CLOSE SHOT - A MORTAR 
A hand drops a shell and it FIRES. 
255  CLOSE SHOT - ROCKET LAUNCHER 
It FIRES. EXPLOSIONS around the fort, red and orange and blue and green. They hit and grow, outward like some sort of cosmic flower. 
256  CLOSE SHOT - A FLAME-THROWER (ON TANK) 
Shoots out a stream of burning napalm that looks like a death ray gun, radiating outward with ice-blue energy. 
257  SHOT ON LOUDSPEAKERS 
blasting out music. 
258  MED. CLOSE VIEW ON YOUNG SOLDIERS 
With the MUSIC, like those people you see listening to radios in their cars. 
259  SHOT ON THE COMMAND BUNKER - WILLARD , KURTZ , OTHERS 
(In SLOW MOTION) Shells WHISTLE in and EXPLODE on the walls in the compound. The men behind them are setting up rocket launcher (missile) . Everywhere metal and rock and flame fly and it is beautiful to see. 
Willard looks through the infra-red sniper scope. 
260  WILLARD - INFRA-RED POV 
Strange, luminescent images of North Vietnamese approach- ing the outer perimeters. Thousands of them. 
KURTZ I was on threshold of great things. 
Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck, holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The spectacle continues in the b.g. 
277  EXT. THE P.B.R. - THE RIVER 
This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages to get him onto the boat. 
278  EXTREME FULL SHOT 
The spectacle of total psychedelic war: the fortress of Nu Mung Ba. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN. 
279  EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING 
The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and some Montagnards sit near them. 
Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something. Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the f.g. below is Lance, dead. 
Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair. 
COLBY Who is he? 
WILLARD He was the tragedy -- the tragedy of this war. 
CUT TO: 
280  THE P.B.R. 
battered, moving slowly down the river. 
281  TIGHTER VIEW 
Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious. Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks. Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air. Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him. The battle is not over. 
KURTZ Don't. Don't frighten them away. 
Willard looks down at him. 
WILLARD So you understand this? 
Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his eyes. There is a slight smile. 
KURTZ Do I not? 
282  EXT. RIVER - MED. VIEW 
The boat moves as though naturally carried by the river. 
KURTZ My river... my people... my jungle... my ideas... my country... my wife... (he looks at Willard) ... my death. 
WILLARD You had immense plans... immense plans... 
KURTZ Yes... 
WILLARD I'm taking you back. 
Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry that is no more than a breath. 
KURTZ The horror, the horror. 
We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching. The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up, craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points. 
COLBY There. 
Over the jungle mountains the small formation of MEDEVAC helicopters hooping toward them. 
COLBY (continuing) How did they know? 
WILLARD They must have seen the fire. 
The helicopters are closer now but high up. Two of them breaking off, spiraling in TOWARD US. 
COLBY They're coming to rescue us. They're Medevac. 
283  CLOSE SHOT ON WILLARD 
He stares up at the sky. 
WILLARD (to himself) They're coming to take us back. 
Copters directly overhead. 
WILLARD (continuing) Yeah. 
COLBY Colonel Kurtz, he's dead. 
WILLARD Yeah. 
He raises his M-16 and FIRES the entire clip at the ap- proaching rescue helicopter. 
284  FULL SHOT - THE COPTER 
It frantically pours on the power and wheels up to the sky. 
285  FULL SHOT - WILLARD, COLBY

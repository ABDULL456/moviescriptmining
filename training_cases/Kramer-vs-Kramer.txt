"KRAMER VS. KRAMER" 
by 
Robert Benton 
FADE IN: 
INT. OFFICE  ADVERTISING AGENCY  MIDTOWN  EVENING 
WIDE SHOT 
A large and very comfortable office over-looking St. Patrick's Cathedral. At the moment the office is filled to bursting with men and women, slumped in chairs, sitting on desks, all of them very tense. Among the crowd of people we note: MURRAY FISHER, a young and very ambitious junior executive and PHYLLIS BERNARD, an attractive woman in her early thirties. She is a lawyer with the agency. 
At the moment, TED KRAMER, nice-looking without being what you would call a matinee idol, paces back and forth. His tie is loosened, he checks his watch every fifteen seconds. Clearly he is very distraught. 
TED (predicting the worst) They're not gonna call... I tell you they're not gonna call. I blew it. I don't know what I did wrong, but I  
REVERSE ON JIM O'CONNOR 
Ted's boss and good friend. He is in his middle fifties, nattily dressed with the slightly bleary look of a heavy drinker. He sits back in his chair with his feet propped on the desk and a drink in one hand. 
O'CONNOR (not unfriendly) Ted, will you take it easy? Revlon's not about to drop an account that represents more than two million in gross billing receipts in a small agency like this, without making us sweat. Now just relax, okay? Everything's gonna be fine. 
TED (at this stage, nothing will help) I don't think so, Jim. Maybe I shouldn't have  
Sound-effect: The phone rings. Everyone freezes. As O'Connor reaches for the phone, 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHILD'S ROOM, KRAMER APT.  EVENING 
The room is dark, the only light coming from a small night light. 
We SEE a beautiful five year old boy (BILLY KRAMER). He lies in bed, half asleep. HOLD FOR A BEAT as a beautiful woman (JOANNA KRAMER) leans over, kisses the child and hugs him tightly to her. 
JOANNA (intense) I love you, Billy... 
BILLY (drowsy) I love you too, mommy... Good-night... 
ON JOANNA 
She gets up from the bed and starts toward the door of the child's room. 
JOANNA Sleep tight... 
BILLY Don't let the bedbugs bite... 
Joanna stops in the doorway, silhouetted against the light. She turns, takes a last look at her son, then steps outside. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY  EVENING 
ON JOANNA 
Now that the light is brighter, we can SEE her more clearly. In her mid-thirties, she is beautiful, dressed in a style that can best be described as Bloomingdale's. HOLD FOR A BEAT as she leans against the door. It is clear from her expression that she is terribly upset. Then, making up her mind, she crosses to a closet and takes out a suitcase. 
THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HER as she carries it into the bedroom, lays it out on the bed and opens it. 
PAN WITH HER as she crosses to a closet, grabs an armload of clothes and dumps them helter-skelter into the suitcase. 
CUT TO: 
INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  EVENING 
It is a few minutes later, the news has obviously been good because there is a general celebration in progress. 
Jim O'Connor, now standing, raises one hand for silence, then making a toast. 
O'CONNOR Here's to Ted Kramer. 
Cheers and good-natured jokes. 
O'CONNOR (putting an arm around Ted squeezing him tight) I wanna tell you something about this little runt. He went out there and sold the shit out of Revlon and that's why we got the account. It was his idea, it was his concept, right down the line... 
More hoots and cheers. People start to yell "Speech." 
TED (embarrassed, but cannot stop grinning) All I can say... All I can say is this is maybe one of the five best days of my whole life... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM  KRAMER APT.  EVENING 
Joanna stands at the medicine cabinet, going through it, packing things in a travel kit: rollers, deodorant, makeup, birth control pills. She starts to take a small bottle of perfume that has only an eighth of an inch of fluid left inside, hesitates, then puts it back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  EVENING 
Now some time has passed, most of the crowd has gone and only the regulars are left. 
TED (in the middle of a story) So anyway Jim and I are making the pitch, right? And all of a sudden this old guy starts to cough and I keep on going and he keeps on coughing and I keep on going and he keeps on coughing and  
Murray Fisher leans over, shakes Ted's hand. 
MURRAY (interrupting) Congratulations, Ted. That was a hell of a job. 
TED (surprised) Where you goin' Murray, it's early? 
MURRAY Got to get home. 
TED (glancing at his watch) Oh, Christ, I'm late... I gotta get out of here. (however, instead of going, he settles back and resumes his story) So anyway, I look over and this old geezer is starting to turn blue and I swear to God the only thing I can think about is that this poor sonofabitch is gonna die on me and screw up the pitch. 
Joanna doesn't even bother to look up at him. She opens her purse, takes out her wallet and begins removing credit cards. 
JOANNA My American Express... My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book  
TED (the martyr) Okay, okay... What is it this time? What did I do now?... 
JOANNA (ignoring this) I took two thousand out of the savings account. That was what I had in the bank when we got married. 
TED Joanna, whatever it is, believe me, I'm sorry. 
JOANNA Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning. They'll be ready on Saturday. 
TED (hard lining it) Now listen, before you do something you'll really regret you'd better stop and think - 
JOANNA (not bothering to look up) I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them. 
She checks off the last item on her list as her husband watches, dumbfounded. 
JOANNA There, that's everything. 
Joanna gets to her feet and starts toward the front door. In an instant Ted is after her. 
TED (panic starting) For God's sake, Joanna, would you at least tell me what I did that's so terrible! Would you do me that little favor? 
ON JOANNA 
At the door. 
JOANNA Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me. It's my fault  you just married the wrong person. 
TED (placating her) So we've got problems. Everybody's got problems  that's normal  
Joanna opens the door and they step out into the hallway. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE KRAMER APT.  EVENING 
JOANNA Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished. 
TED I'm listening, Joanna  believe me, I'm listening. My wife is walking out on me after eight years of  
JOANNA (bitter) You just don't get it, do you? (as though to a child) I  am  really  and  truly  leaving  you. 
TED I heard you, Joanna. I promise I heard you. 
JOANNA No you didn't. (quietly) You didn't even ask about Billy. 
TED (stiffening) What about Billy? 
JOANNA I'm not taking him with me. 
TED What? 
JOANNA (tears start) Ted, I can't... I tried... I really tried but... I just can't hack it anymore... 
TED C'mon, Joanna, you don't mean that. You're a terrific mother  
JOANNA (from her gut) I am not! I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother. I yell at him all the time. I have no patience. No... No. He's better off without me. (unable to look at Ted) Ted, I've got to go... I've got to go. 
TED (desperate) Okay, I understand and I promise I won't try and stop you, but you can't just go... Look, come inside and talk... Just for a few minutes. 
JOANNA (pleading) NO!... Please... Please don't make me stay... I swear... If you do, sooner or later... maybe tomorrow, maybe next week... maybe a year from now... (looking directly at him) I'll go right out the window. 
Sound-effect: The elevator approaching. 
CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: 
There is nothing more that can be done, this is the last moment of intimacy. 
TED (quiet) Where are you going? 
JOANNA I don't know... 
The elevator door opens, Joanna steps inside. 
TED Do you want me to help you get a cab? 
Joanna shakes her head. The elevator door closes behind her and it starts to descend. 
ON TED KRAMER 
He stands for a moment, stunned, unable to move. Then he turns and races back into the apartment. 
THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he rushes across to one of the living room windows, throws it open and leans out. 
HIS POV 
Looking down to the street from the eighth floor. We SEE Joanna step off the curb and hail a passing taxi. 
TED (calling out) Joanna!?... Joanna?! 
Either she doesn't hear him or else she pays no attention. She gets into the cab, closes the door behind her and it drives away. 
CUT TO: 
INT. APT.  NIGHT 
ON TED 
As he stands for a moment watching the taxi as it disappears. 
Then, slowly, he closes the window, turns, and AS THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM, walks into the bedroom. 
The bedroom is a mess: the closet door stands open, inside Joanna's section is empty except for some shoe-boxes and a few dresses that are scattered across the floor. Several dresser drawers have been pulled out and their contents emptied. 
Ted looks at Billy in amazement. 
WIDE SHOT 
As the two of them enter the school and disappear from view. 
CUT TO: 
INT. OFFICE, TED'S AGENCY  DAY 
ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS 
As they open and Ted steps out looking like the wrath of God. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he crosses the waiting room toward the inner offices. 
ON THE RECEPTIONIST 
Glancing up as he passes. 
RECEPTIONIST (cheerful) Congratulations, Mr. Kramer. 
ON TED 
Looking at her like she has lost her mind. Nevertheless he continues on, passing through swinging doors into a long corridor lined with secretaries' desks and offices leading off of it. 
Suddenly a younger man rushes up, grabs Ted's hand and starts to pump it vigorously. 
YOUNG MAN Terrific news, Ted. 
Another nut. Ted smiles at the man, humoring him and continues toward his office. O'Connor appears, throwing his arm around Ted, squeezing him in a bear hug. 
O'CONNOR Hey... Look who was out celebrating last night. 
Suddenly Ted realizes that all these people are congratulating him for getting the Fire and Ice account. 
TED (trying to appear nonchalant) Uh, Jim... Can I talk to you? 
CUT TO: 
INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  DAY 
Ted and O'Connor sitting across from one another. O'Connor has just heard the news. 
O'CONNOR Jesus Christ. That's a real blockbuster. (shakes his head) I always figured you guys had it made. 
TED (morose) You want to know the real kicker? The real kicker is, for the first time in my life  the first time  I feel like a loser. 
O'Connor nods sympathetically. Actually he is praying that Ted won't start to cry. 
O'CONNOR (stiff upper lip) Listen, don't let it get you down. (doesn't believe it for a second) You're going to be fine. 
TED (toujour gai) Me? I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine. 
O'CONNOR Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay? Three marriages, two divorces... You're gonna be okay. 
TED (wishful thinking) I'm going to be okay. The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time. 
O'CONNOR (emphatically) She'll be back... 
Ted nods in agreement. There is a beat of silence as both men consider Joanna's imminent return. Then: 
O'CONNOR (trying to be tactful) But... just in case... I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid? 
TED (the wind goes out of him) I don't know, Jim. This whole thing has happened so... Pow  like that. 
O'CONNOR (a friend having to say something very difficult) Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay? But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while. Just until you get yourself straightened out. 
TED (doubtfully) I don't know, Jim... 
O'CONNOR (the Dutch uncle) Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us  that's you and me  to deliver the goods. Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose  
TED Jim, I appreciate what you're saying. I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back. 
ON O'CONNOR 
Clearly he doesn't believe this. 
O'CONNOR I hope you're right, Ted... I really hope you're right. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FOYER  KRAMER APT.  DAY 
INSERT: TIGHT ON AN ENVELOPE 
It is postmarked Denver, Colorado. The letter is addressed to Billy Kramer and it is from Joanna. 
ON TED 
As he rips open the letter. 
TED Billy! 
ON BILLY 
He sits in the living room watching television, a chocolate doughnut in one hand and a remote control device for watching television in the other. 
Off-screen Sound: a Saturday morning kiddie program from the television set. 
BILLY (focused on T.V.) Uh, huh... 
TED You got a letter from mom. 
Instantly, Billy turns down the volume of the television. 
In the BACKGROUND we SEE the bathroom door as it opens and Billy Kramer steps out, freshly bathed and wearing clean clothes. 
THELMA (without looking around) Brush the teeth. Hang up the towel and flush the toilet. 
Billy immediately turns on his heels and heads back into the bathroom. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  DAY 
CLOSE ON A SILVER CIGARETTE BOX 
That is inscribed, "Ted and Joanna Kramer, Married April 4, 
HOLD FOR A BEAT then Ted's hand reaches into FRAME and picks it up. 
MEDIUM SHOT TED 
As he takes the cigarette box and balances it on a stack of scrap books, photographs, ash trays, etc., etc., that he is carrying. He crosses to another table, picks up a framed photograph of Joanna and Billy and piles that on top of everything. We realize that Ted is going through the apartment from top to bottom and methodically cleaning out every trace of Joanna that he can find.

EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING  NIGHT 
ESTABLISHING SHOT 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT 
WIDE SHOT 
As Ted goes through the room, picking up Billy's clothes which have been strewn every which way. 
THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he carries them into Billy's room. 
INT. BILLY'S ROOM  NIGHT 
Billy is fast asleep, the only light coming from the night lamp on the dresser. Ted dumps the soiled clothing in a hamper, hangs up Billy's jacket, then he neatly folds the boy's sweater and crosses to the dresser. 
CLOSER IN ON THE DRESSER 
As Ted opens a drawer and starts to put the sweater away. Suddenly he spots something. 
CUT TO: 
HIS POV 
There, in the drawer, sitting on top of a pile of clothing is one of the photographs of Joanna that Ted put away this afternoon. 
Billy has retrieved it and hidden it here, hoping that Ted wouldn't find it. 
CLOSE ON TED 
As he takes a long look at the photograph, then turns to his son. 
HIS POV 
Billy asleep, tangled up in the covers. 
ON TED 
He removes the photograph from the drawer, crosses to the bed and places it on the nightstand nearby so that Billy will be able to see the picture of Joanna when he wakes up in the morning. He sits for a moment longer on the side of the bed and reaches across and smooths down his son's rumpled hair. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT. TED'S OFFICE  LATE AFTERNOON 
ON TED 
Clearly in a rush, loading his briefcase with work to do that evening. He starts for the door and THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM as he walks along the outer office corridor, heading for the elevator. As he passes the door to O'Connor's office: 
TED (calling out) 'Night, Jim. 
O'CONNOR (O.S.) (calling out) Hey, Ted. C'mon in. I wanna' talk to you. 
Reluctantly Ted stops, turns around and walks back to the door to O'Connor's office. 
CUT TO: 
INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  LATE AFTERNOON 
O'Connor sits back in his chair, his feet propped on the desk a drink in one hand. 
O'CONNOR (jovial) What's the big rush. C'mon in, put your feet up, have a drink. 
REVERSE ON TED 
Hanging in the doorway, clearly anxious to leave. 
TED Can't do it tonight. Gotta pick up Billy. I'm late. 
O'CONNOR (paying no attention to that) Listen, I heard a terrific joke today. There's this Polish skydiver  
TED (urgent) Sorry, Jim I've got to go. I'll talk to you tomorrow. 
And before O'Connor can say anything he is gone. 
REVERSE ON O'CONNOR 
Obviously displeased. He sits for a moment, drumming his fingers on the desk top, then reaches for the phone and starts to dial. A moment later: 
O'CONNOR Murray? Jim O'Connor, why don't you drop by and have a drink... 
HIS POV 
There in the distance is Billy Kramer, running as hard as he can away from Ted. 
ON TED 
TRACKING IN FRONT OF HIM as he starts to chase after Billy. 
HIS POV  TRACKING FORWARD 
It is clear that Billy is running with a purpose. 
TED (V.O.) Billy! 
Billy pays no attention to him. 
ON TED 
TRACKING IN FRONT OF HIM as he continues to chase his son. 
HIS POV  TRACKING FORWARD 
Closer now, we can SEE that ahead of Billy is a woman that, from behind, looks remarkably like Joanna. 
CLOSER ON TED 
As he realizes what is about to happen. 
CLOSER ON BILLY 
Catching up to the woman. 
BILLY Mommy! Mommy! 
A moment later he gets close enough to grab onto her skirt. As the woman turns around: 
CLOSEUP WOMAN 
Quite clearly it is not Joanna. 
CLOSEUP BILLY 
His face becomes impassive again. All the excitement vanishes. 
BILLY Oh. I thought you were my mommy. 
CLOSEUP TED 
His face reveals all of the pain that Billy's can't. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CLASSROOM, NURSERY SCHOOL  DAY 
CLOSE ON A HOMEMADE CURTAIN 
As it opens and Billy Kramer, wearing an outsized moustache, a makeshift cape and a stovepipe hat made from construction paper. 
He stands for a moment, looking around, finally he spots someone, grins and begins waving. 
HIS POV 
Across the room eighteen to twenty mothers (Ted Kramer is the only man present) are gathered, sitting on tiny chairs and at work tables watching as their children put on a show. 
ON BILLY 
Suddenly he forgets his lines, looks around nervously. A moment later a very pretty young teacher leans over, whispers in his ear. 
TEACHER Ladies and gentlemen... 
BILLY Ladies and gentlemen... 
TEACHER Welcome to the greatest show on earth. 
BILLY Welcome to the... (he forgets again) 
REVERSE ON TED 
He leans forward mouthing the words as the teacher prompts Billy. 
TEACHER Greatest. 
BILLY Greatest... 
TEACHER Show. 
BILLY Show... 
TEACHER On earth. 
BILLY On earth. 
Ted breathes a sigh of relief, his son having gotten through it. 
CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THE CHILDREN PUTTING ON THE SHOW AND TED KRAMER SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE WATCHING: 
A look of total pleasure on his face. From time to time when Billy does something particularly difficult, Ted nudges the woman next to him. 
Note: In all of the shots of Billy we SEE the teacher there guiding, helping, over and over and over we cannot help but notice how attractive she is. Toward the end of the show Ted's POV occasionally follows the teacher rather than the child. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
WIDE SHOT 
TED Look, Billy, I told you before, one hour of T.V. a day, that's the rule... No... (clearly, Billy is giving him an argument) I don't care what the other mothers do... Listen, I can't talk now, I'm in a meeting... (firm) Billy, I'll talk to you later, good- bye. 
Note: During the phone call, the CAMERA PANS AWAY to Murray & O'connor, looks of bored Condescension and smug superiority on their faces. 
Ted hangs up the phone and turns back around. 
MURRAY (smooth) Ted, I appreciate what you're saying, but I really think you're just too close to it right now. 
O'CONNOR (quickly) Murray's right. (reassuring) Look it's just some ideas, okay? I mean nothing's locked in cement. I promise you this is your show... 
ON TED 
Not very reassured. 
O'CONNOR Trust me on this one, Ted... 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT 
Ted is sitting at the dining room table, working. Spread out all across the table are layouts, rate sheets, etc., etc. Billy sits across from him drawing on a pad with felt-tipped pens. HOLD FOR A BEAT, then: 
BILLY (worried about something) Mom, I mean dad... 
TED (busy) In a minute... 
beat of silence then: 
BILLY What do you do when an elephant sits on your fence? 
Silence. 
BILLY You get a new fence. 
TED (he hasn't heard a word) C'mon, Billy. I'm trying to work for God's sake... 
Another beat of silence, then Billy reaches for his glass of Hawaiian Punch and accidentally tips it over, spilling purple liquid across all of Ted's papers. 
Instantly, Ted is on his feet, yelling. 
TED Goddamnit, can't you watch what you're doing! 
CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: 
BILLY (quiet) I'm sorry. 
TED Je-sus Christ! I catch all kind of shit at the office because I'm not pulling my weight because I'm busting my butt trying to be a decent goddamn father and  
BILLY I'm sorry. 
TED (sardonic) That's terrific. That's really terrific, but I notice I'm the one that's cleaning up this  (noticing an important paper covered with grape juice) Oh, crap, I'll have to do this one over. 
BILLY (starting to help) I'm sorry. 
By now there is nothing the boy can do right. 
TED Look, it's after your bedtime, okay? Just do me a favor and go to bed, okay? 
Billy gets to his feet, collects his stuff and walks into his bedroom. HOLD ON TED who sits for a moment, then gets wearily to his feet and as THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM crosses to the door of Billy's room. He stops in the doorway, looks OFF SCREEN. 
HIS POV 
Billy struggling to get his pajamas on, having a hard time. 
CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: 
TED Look, I'm sorry I yelled, okay? 
BILLY (quiet) That's okay. 
TED It's just... I've been catching a lot of flack at the office... 
BILLY That's okay... 
INT. OFFICE  DAY 
ON THE DOOR TO O'CONNOR'S OFFICE 
As it opens and Phyllis comes out. In the background in O'Connor's office we SEE O'Connor and Murray, talking, laughing. 
THE CAMERA TRACKS ALONGSIDE Phyllis as she walks to Ted Kramer's office and opens the door without knocking. 
PHYLLIS How about lunch, Kramer. I'm buying. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESTAURANT, MIDTOWN  DAY 
ON TED AND PHYLLIS 
As they sit across from one another. A waiter stands over them, setting drinks in front of them. 
WAITER Perrier and lime... (placing a drink in front of Phyllis) ...and scotch with soda. (putting Ted's drink in front of him) 
The waiter bustles away. 
TED Okay, Phyllis, what's up? 
PHYLLIS Kramer... 
She breaks off, uncertain whether or not to go on. Then, making up her mind, she reaches across, takes Ted's scotch and soda and drinks half of it down in one gulp. 
PHYLLIS (in a rush) O'Connor's out to get you. He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you. 
He reaches across and scrapes most of the sauce off of the meat. 
TED There, okay? Now that's just plain old hamburger. 
BILLY Some of the brown stuff is still there. 
TED (through clenched teeth) Then eat around it. 
BILLY No. 
TED (anger building) Now listen to me, young man. Do you know what I had to go through to put this goddamn food on the goddamn table? 
BILLY (obstinate) I don't care. I hate it. I want pizza. 
TED (blowing up) Not on your life. That's it. I've had it with crap around this house. From now on, no more pizza! Get it? Starting right now you can eat real food like a normal human being! 
BILLY No! 
By now both of them are out of control. 
TED You want to know something?! You are a spoiled selfish little brat! Now eat  
Billy takes his plate and looking his father straight in the eye deliberately overturns it, spilling food everywhere. 
ON TED 
He is out of his chair like a shot, crosses to Billy and jerks him to his feet. 
TED (yelling) Goddamnit! Go to your room! 
He half-carries, half-drags the child kicking and screaming into his room. THE CAMERA TRACKS ALONGSIDE THEM. 
BILLY (at the top of his voice) Owwww... You're hurting me... You're hurting me... I hate you... I hate you... 
TED (seething) You're no bargain either, pal. 
BILLY I want my mommy... I want my mommy.. 
By now they have reached Billy's room. Ted dumps him on the bed unceremoniously and starts out of the room. 
BILLY (sobbing) I want my... mm... ommy... I want mmmy... mommy... 
TED (at the door) Tough shit. You're stuck with me. 
And he slams the door behind him. 
CUT TO: 
WIDE SHOT 
The dining area. Ted sits down and tries to resume his meal alone. 
BILLY (O.S.) (sobbing, fighting to catch his breath) I want my... mmmo... mmmy. I want mmmy mmo... mmy... 
CLOSER IN ON TED 
As he lifts his glass to take a drink and we can SEE that he is shaking like a leaf. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN  NIGHT 
ON TED 
As he finishes doing the last of the dishes, dries his hands and looks around to make sure that everything has been put away. He flips off the light and, as THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH HIM, he walks from room to room, turning off the lights, until he reaches the door to Billy's room which is still closed. Ted hesitates for a moment, then eases open the door and steps inside. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BILLY'S ROOM  NIGHT 
TED'S POV 
Billy lies sprawled across the bed, all tangled up in the covers. 
ON TED 
As he crosses to the sleeping child and starts to straighten the covers. 
BILLY (tentatively) Daddy? 
TED (all anger gone) Yeah? 
BILLY I'm sorry... 
TED (kisses him) That's okay, pal. Go back to sleep. It's very late. 
He starts to get up, when: 
BILLY Daddy? 
TED Uh huh? 
BILLY (very quiet) Are you... gonna go... away? 
ON TED 
Stunned at the question. 
TED Of course I'm not going away. I love you very much. I'll be right here. 
There is a beat of silence, then: 
BILLY (it comes pouring out) That's why mommy left... isn't it? 'Cause I was bad... 
BILLY Daddy, look! Presenting Billy Kramer's Fantastic Superjet! 
And he begins to race around the area, making jet noises and holding the airplane in his hand. 
REVERSE ON TED 
Watching him, smiling. 
ON BILLY 
Weaving in and around the benches. He turns and starts back towards Ted. As he does: 
QUICK CUT: INSERT: 
Billy's foot, as he trips. 
ON BILLY 
As he starts to fall, still holding onto the airplane. 
QUICK CUT: TED 
Watching, horrified. 
ON BILLY 
As he hits the concrete. 
ON TED 
He leaps to his feet, starts toward the boy. 
ON BILLY 
As he looks up. 
JUMP CUT IN TO EXTREME CLOSEUP 
There is a terrible-looking gash running from his cheek into his hairline. 
Kim screams at the sight of the blood. 
BILLY (terrified) Daddy! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ENTRANCE TO CENTRAL PARK  AFTERNOON 
ON THE ENTRANCE 
As Ted, carrying Billy, wrapped in his coat, comes barreling out of the park, nearly knocking over several people with shopping bags, and begins running like hell WITH THE CAMERA TRACKING JUST IN FRONT OF HIM. In the BACKGROUND we SEE Thelma and Kim chasing after him. THE LENGTH OF THE TRACKING SHOT SHOULD BE MUCH LONGER THAN WE EXPECT. IT SHOULD, IN FACT, COVER THE THREE CITY BLOCKS BETWEEN THE KRAMER APARTMENT AND THE HOSPITAL, ACROSS STREETS WITHOUT STOPPING FOR THE LIGHT, ALONG CROWDED SIDEWALKS WITHOUT STOPPING, ENDING FINALLY ON THE EMERGENCY ENTRANCE TO THE HOSPITAL. IT MUST BE GENUINELY SUPERHUMAN, GENUINELY HEROIC. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EXAMINATION ROOM, EMERGENCY SECTION, HOSPITAL  DAY 
ON TED KRAMER 
He is covered with Billy's blood, it is on his face, his shirt, his trousers. At the moment 'he stands helpless, watching as, Off-Screen, a surgeon examines Billy's wound. 
SURGEON (O.S.) (calm, reassuring) That's good, Billy... That's a brave boy... Now then, how's that? Now we've cleaned it out... 
WIDER SHOT 
Billy lies on the examining table with the doctor bending over him. 
SURGEON There. That wasn't so bad, was it? 
Billy doesn't say anything. 
SURGEON Now then, you just wait here, Billy. I want to talk to your dad for a minute. 
The doctor motions for Thelma to wait with Billy and he crosses to Ted who stands in the doorway. 
CLOSER IN ON THEN 
SURGEON (low voice, again calm and reassuring) Your boy is very lucky, Mr. Kramer. One inch over and it would have caught the eye. 
REACTION TED 
SURGEON But I'm going to have to take some stitches. 
TED (flat) How many? 
SURGEON Ten. 
Ted closes his eyes, there is a sharp intake of breath. 
SURGEON Because of the position of the wound and your son's age, I don't think there will be much of a scar. Otherwise I'd call in a plastic surgeon. 
Ted nods. 
SURGEON Now, I'd advise you to wait outside. It'll be eas  
TED (like a shot) No. 
SURGEON (reasonable) Mr. Kramer, there's  
TED (softly, but with real vehemence) Fuck you. He's my son. I'm staying with him.

As Ted enters, looks around. The Maitre d'hotel approaches. From his attitude, it is clear that Ted and Joanna were regular customers. 
MAITRE D'HOTEL Good evening, Mr. Kramer. We haven't seen you for a long time. Mrs. Kramer, she waits for you in the back. 
TED Thank you, John. 
THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH TED as he walks toward the back room of the restaurant. Several waiters approach and say hello, the piano player looks up and smiles. As he reaches the door to the back room.

INT. BACK ROOM 
TED'S POV  JOANNA 
She sits against the wall, a glass of white wine in front of her. 
She is dressed simply and no longer has a tan. Nevertheless, Joanna is still stunningly beautiful. HOLD ON HER FOR A BEAT as she looks up, smiles. 
ON TED 
He stands watching her, his knees weak. It is impossible not to fall in love with her all over again. 
TWO SHOT 
As he crosses to her table, sits down. 
JOANNA Hello, Ted. You look well. 
TED So do you. 
The waiter appears, carrying a scotch and soda. He sets it down on the table in front of Ted. 
WAITER The usual, Mr. Kramer. 
TED (not taking his eyes off Joanna) Thanks, Gino. 
The waiter nods and promptly disappears. 
JOANNA How's the new job? 
TED Fine. 
There is a self-conscious pause. From the bar, the piano player begins playing a new song. From Ted and Joanna's reaction, it is clearly a song that has meant a great deal to them in the past. 
They listen for a moment, then: 
TED Look at us, Joanna. Just like any old married couple having dinner. Who would believe it. 
JOANNA Yes... How's Billy? 
ON TED 
The question he has been dreading. 
TED He's great... except... (not looking at her) ...Except he had... he fell and he cut his face. He... He has a scar, Joanna, from about here to here. (indicating where and how big) 
There is a beat of silence. A moment of shared feeling. 
TED (he has to say it to someone) I can't help but feel somehow... it's my fault. I keep thinking I could've done something  stopped it... 
JOANNA You can't tell it from a distance, Ted. 
For the first time he looks up at her. 
TED What? 
CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: 
JOANNA I've seen him. 
TED You have? 
JOANNA A few times. Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school. 
ON TED 
Speechless. 
JOANNA He looks like a terrific kid. 
TED He is... (he still can't get over it) You sat in that coffee shop across from school  
JOANNA (completing the sentence) Watching my son... Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months. 
TED (amazed) You've been living here, in the city? 
JOANNA (a deep breath) Ted... The reason I wanted to see you... I want Billy back. 
TED You want what?! 
JOANNA (firm) I want my son. I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son. 
TED Are you out of your mind?! You're the one that walked out on him, remember? 
BILLY (half-asleep) I love you too daddy. 
Ted kisses the child, gets to his feet and starts toward the door.

CLOSE ON TED 
Hold on him listening as it slowly dawns on him that he is being fired. 
O'CONNOR (stiff) Disappointing. It only pulled a fourteen share and they were hoping for a twenty five minimum, and... ah... they're not very happy and... Well, the guys have decided they want to... ah, re-think the entire concept and... Look, I don't like having to do this, okay?... But... I mean, what I mean is... ah, I'm going to have to... ah, let you go  
TED (not really sure he heard right) Are you firing me, Jim? 
ON O'CONNOR 
He still has his back to Ted. 
O'CONNOR C'mon, Ted, don't get emotional. Okay? (whining) Look, this isn't exactly an easy thing for me to do, y'know? I swear Murray and I did everything we could, but those sons of bitches were out for blood. I mean it was all I could do to keep the account inside the shop... Look, I promise, if I hear of anything I'll let you know first thing.

INTERVIEWER (glancing at a form Ted has filled out) Ummm, hmmm... umm, hmmm... (the good news) Well, this looks very good.. Of course (the bad news) ...you understand this is the worst time of the year to look for a job. 
TED (panic) What?! What do you mean, I don't understand. 
INTERVIEWER (patronizing) Mr. Kramer, nobody even thinks about leaving their job until after they get their Christmas bonus.

The large room is crowded with secretaries, junior executives, researchers, editors, ad-men, etc., etc. They all have drinks in their hands and there is a good deal of kissing and general conviviality going on. 
THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH ACKERMAN as he steps out of his office, closes the door behind him and makes his way across the room to MR. SPENCER, the Advertising Director. At the moment, Spencer stands with his coat over one arm and a drink in his hand talking to a very pretty young woman. Ackerman approaches him, whispers something in his ear. Spencer shakes his head and points to his watch. Ackerman says something else and finally, with a look of weary resignation, Spencer excuses himself from the pretty young woman and follows Ackerman back to his office. THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM. As Ackerman opens the door to his office, THE CAMERA IS ANGLED so that we can SEE past them, into the office where Ted stands waiting. 
ACKERMAN (as they enter) Mr. Spencer, Mr. Kramer. 
SPENCER (not wasting any time) So you're the go-getter. All right, you've got ten minutes. 
As the door closes behind them, blocking our view, THE CAMERA PANS UP to a clock over the door. It reads five-fifteen.

Which now reads five twenty-two. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL Spencer, now sitting in Ackerman's chair, his feet on Ackerman's desk. Ted has just finished his pitch. 
SPENCER (sipping his drink) That's very interesting, Mr. Kramer. I must say, it's very interesting. Let me think about it. I'll let Jack... (indicating Ackerman) ...know and he'll get in touch with you. 
Spencer gets to his feet, starts to retrieve his coat.

TED Excuse me, I believe you said I had ten minutes.

Almost at the door, looking around. 
SPENCER Well? 
ON TED 
Checking his watch. 
TED That means I've got two minutes left. I understand you're paying twenty- five. 
Spencer nods. 
TED (a deep breath, then a real huckster) All right, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do  I'll take the job at twenty- two-five. Now, that's twenty-five hundred less than you're offering. The only thing is, you have to say yes right now. Not tomorrow. Not next week. Not after the holidays. It's worth it to me for a yes right now and I'll take twenty-five hundred less. 
There is a long beat of silence as Spencer and Ackerman look at one another. They were clearly not prepared for this. 
TED (watching them) Today only. One day only. Twenty-two five. 
SPENCER Mr. Kramer, can we talk privately for a moment? 
TED Certainly. 
CUT TO: 
OUTER OFFICE  LATE AFTERNOON 
ON TED 
As he steps out of Ackerman's office, sits down. Now, all of the fear, all of the anxiety that he has been fighting down comes welling up. What if he pushed too hard? What will he do if he doesn't get a job? If Ted Kramer could fall to his knees and pray, he would. 
CROSS-CUT WITH THE CHRISTMAS PARTY 
That swirls around him. We notice in particular, one very pretty young woman flirting with a number of men. She is wearing a dress with straps, one of them has broken and she has patched it with a piece of masking tape. 
Finally the door to Ackerman's office opens and he steps out. 
ACKERMAN Mr. Kramer? 
Ted jumps to his feet, starts into the office.

Ted and Phyllis, getting ready to go to bed. They look like a couple that has been married at least five years. Ted is busy talking as he takes off his tie, jacket and starts to unbutton his shirt. Phyllis is getting undressed also, hanging things in the closet, putting things away in drawers. But as Ted continues to talk, she watches him apprehensively, it is clear that something is wrong. 
TED (he has become an armchair lawyer) So, naturally, you assume that since Joanna left, that would be a compelling point against her, right? 
PHYLLIS (thoughtful) Right. 
TED But it doesn't work that way. A major decision was handed down by the Appellate Court in 1969  in the case of Haskins vs. Haskins. 
PHYLLIS Kramer  
TED Now in Haskins vs. Haskins the court ruled in favor of the mother, thus establishing a precedent for awarding the child to the mother even though she previously abandoned the baby. 
PHYLLIS Kramer... There's something I ought to tell you. 
TED Yeah? 
PHYLLIS I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.

She shakes her head, then, reaches out and touches him. 
PHYLLIS I'll miss you, Kramer...

It is open and standing in the doorway is an attractive woman, a bit overweight and very serious. This is DR. ALVAREZ, the court appointed psychiatrist. 
ALVAREZ Mr. Kramer? 
TED Yes? 
ALVAREZ I'm Dr. Alvarez, Judge Atkins asked me to look in on your son and prepare an evaluation sheet. 
TED Oh, yes. Won't you come in. 
Dr. Alvarez enters the apartment. Ted helps her off with her coat. 
ALVAREZ Where is the child? 
TED He's in his room, playing. 
ALVAREZ Good. I'll see him in there. 
As Ted carries her coat to the closet, Dr. Alvarez walks into the living room, looks around. 
ALVAREZ Mr. Kramer, do you ever have sex in here with anyone? 
TED Doctor, I attempt to conduct my social life discreetly. At the moment I am seeing no one. 
CROSS-CUTTING BETWEEN THEM: 
ALVAREZ Does that distress you? 
TED Not particularly. 
ALVAREZ What does? 
TED The prospect of losing my child. 
ALVAREZ (makes some notes, then:) Very well, I'd like to see him if I may. 
They cross to the door of Billy's room. Ted opens it.

The room is a mess, blocks are stacked everywhere. Billy sits in the middle playing with his toys.

TED (pleased) You like it? 
Billy crosses to the window, presses his nose to the glass, looks out. 
BILLY Wow! Is this really where you work? 
Ted nods, walks over to the desk and begins collecting paperwork to do over the weekend. As he does, Billy goes through the office, sitting in every chair, looking in every drawer. 
BILLY Is this really your desk? 
TED Yep. 
BILLY Is that really your chair? 
TED Uh huh... 
BILLY Wow! That's neat. Can I sit in it? 
TED Sure. 
Billy plops himself down in Ted's chair, swivels around. 
BILLY Did mommy ever see this? 
TED No, she never did. 
BILLY Are you going to get remarried? 
TED I don't know. I hadn't thought much about it. 
BILLY Are you going to remarried Phyllis? 
TED (shaking his head) No.

There is a long pause, then: 
BILLY Will you and mommy get remarried? 
Ted stops what he is doing, looks across at Billy:

JOANNA Yes. 
SHAUNESSY In all that time did your husband ever strike you or abuse you physically in any way. 
JOANNA No. 
SHAUNESSY Did your husband strike or physically abuse his child in any way? 
JOANNA No. 
SHAUNESSY Would you describe your husband as an alcoholic? 
JOANNA No. 
SHAUNESSY A heavy drinker? 
JOANNA No. 
SHAUNESSY Was he unfaithful? 
JOANNA No. 
SHAUNESSY Did he ever fail to provide for you? 
JOANNA No. 
SHAUNESSY (wry smile) Well, I can certainly understand why you left him. 
GRESSEN Objection. 
SHAUNESSY (switching his line of questioning) How long do you plan to live in New York, Mrs. Kramer? 
JOANNA Permanently. 
Note: During the early part of Shaunessy's cross-examination, Joanna has been very forthright, very sure of herself. Now, as he starts getting tougher, she begins to falter. 
SHAUNESSY Permanently? (smiles, like a shark smiles) Mrs. Kramer, how many boy friends have you had  permanently? 
ON JOANNA 
Her head snaps back as though she's been hit. 
JOANNA I don't recall. 
SHAUNESSY (boring in) How many lovers have you had  permanently?

SHAUNESSY More than three, less than thirty- three  permanently? 
ON GRESSEN 
He is again on his feet, outraged. 
GRESSEN Objection! 
JUDGE Overruled. The witness will answer, please. 
JOANNA (almost a whisper) Somewhere in between. 
SHAUNESSY Do you have a lover now? 
GRESSEN (furious) Objection! 
SHAUNESSY (to the judge) Your honor, I would request a direct answer to a direct question. Does she have a lover? 
JUDGE I'll allow that. The witness will answer please. 
JOANNA (in a whisper) Yes. 
SHAUNESSY Is that... permanent? 
JOANNA (by now she is becoming thoroughly rattled) I... I don't know... 
SHAUNESSY Then, we don't really know, do we, when you say "permanently" if you're planning to remain in New York, or even to keep the child for that matter, since you've never really done anything in your life that was continuing, stable, that could be regarded as permanent. 
ON THE PETITIONER'S TABLE 
Gressen jumps to his feet. 
GRESSEN Objection! I must ask that the counsel be prevented from harassing the witness. 
JUDGE Sustained. 
SHAUNESSY (a new attack) Mrs. Kramer, how can you consider yourself a fit mother when you have been a failure at virtually every relationship you have undertaken as an adult? 
GRESSEN (red in the face) Objection! 
JUDGE Sustained. 
SHAUNESSY I'll ask it another way. What was the longest personal relationship you have had in your life  other than parents and girlfriends? 
JOANNA (rattled) Ah... I guess I'd have to say... with my child. 
SHAUNESSY (wonder, irony) Whom you've seen twice in a year? Mrs. Kramer, your ex-husband, wasn't he the longest personal relationship in your life? 
JOANNA (reluctantly) I suppose... 
SHAUNESSY Would you speak up, Mrs. Kramer? I couldn't hear you. 
JOANNA (louder) Yes. 
SHAUNESSY How long was that? 
Ted sits at the dining table poring over law books, writing copious notes on a legal pad. Billy sits across from him drawing in a pad with magic markers. HOLD FOR A BEAT as Billy looks up at his father. It is clear that something is bothering him. 
BILLY Mom  I mean, dad? 
TED (not looking up) Uh, huh? 
BILLY What did you do when you were little? 
TED (still involved in his books) I guess about the same kind of things you do. 
BILLY Did you watch "I Dream of Jeannie?"

ON THELMA 
She sits in the witness stand being examined by Shaunessy. From her attitude it is clear that she is very wrought up, that all of this is taking a heavy emotional toll on her. 
SHAUNESSY Mrs. Phillips, how long have you known Ted Kramer? 
THELMA Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building. 
SHAUNESSY How often do you see Mr. Kramer and his son? 
THELMA (to the judge, by way of explanation) Charley, my husband, and I are... divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot. So, I guess we see each three or four times a week. 
SHAUNESSY Can you describe the relationship between Mr. Kramer and his son? 
THELMA It's beautiful. It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship. 
ON GRESSEN 
Getting wearily to his feet. 
GRESSEN (patronizing) Objection, your honor. The answer is, to be generous, very vague. 
SHAUNESSY Can you recall any particular incident that relates to Mr. Kramer's care of his child? 
THELMA (fighting a losing battle with her emotions) Ted  Mr. Kramer, spends a great deal of time with his child. I don't just mean hours, I mean good time, involved time. He reads to Billy. They play together. They talk all the time... (tears start) He is a very... kind man... a very... devoted father, and... and... (she turns to Joanna) And Joanna if you ever saw them together... there wouldn't be a trial at all... (she breaks down, weeping) Oh, shit... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... 
Note: during this we cross-cut to Joanna, who sits, staring at her friend, shaken. 
SHAUNESSY (gently) No further questions. Thank you Mrs. Phillips. 
GRESSEN (without looking up from his notes) No questions.

CUT TO: 
INT. COURTROOM  DAY 
ON TED KRAMER 
Sitting in the witness stand. 
SHAUNESSY Mr. Kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child. 
TED (speaking quietly) When Joanna  (to the judge, correcting himself)  my ex-wife  when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage... Well, I guess most of what she said was probably true. There were a lot of things I didn't understand  a lot of things I would do different if I could. Just like I guess there are a lot of things Joanna wishes she could change... But we can't. Some things, once they are done, can't be undone. Joanna says she loves Billy. I believe she does. So do I. But the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue. The only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for Billy... When Joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, I suppose she's right. But by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex? I guess I've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent: constancy, patience, understanding... love. Where is it written that a man has any less of those qualities than a woman? Billy has a home with me, I've tried to make it the best I could. It's not perfect. I'm not a perfect parent. (unconsciously echoing something Joanna said earlier) I don't have enough patience. Sometimes I forget he's just a little kid... But I love him... More than anything in this world I love him. 
SHAUNESSY Thank you, Mr. Kramer. No further questions. 
ON GRESSEN 
TED (sarcastic) Yeah, well he did, didn't he. 
JOANNA Please, Ted. I never would have brought it up if I thought  
TED I'm not interested, Joanna. Goodbye.

Thelma nods. 
TED Really? 
Thelma nods. 
TED (conflicting emotions) Hey, that's terrific. 
THELMA (hastily) Maybe. I said maybe. (apologizing for her good fortune) What I mean is, ah... I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...

That the respondent pay for the maintenance and support of said child, four hundred dollars each month. That the father shall have the following rights of visitation: every other weekend, one night each week to be mutually agreed upon and one half of the child's vacation period.

CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET  DAY 
ON THE SAME MAILBOX 
As a sack of mail is loaded into a truck. 
TED (V.O.) His doctor, by the way, is still Ed Davies. The Sundafed is for colds, one tablespoon every four hours. I will pack it in the blue suitcase. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. JOANNA KRAMER'S APT. BLDG.  DAY 
WIDE SHOT 
A POSTMAN enters the building carrying a bag of mail. 
TED (V.O.) His best stories have been Babar and Winnie the Pooh up to now, with Batman moving up. His housekeeper has been Etta Willewska and she is the main reason for the note. She is a loving woman, conscientious, very concerned about Billy and more important, Billy cares about her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY, JOANNA'S APT. BLDG.  DAY 
ON A STACK OF MAIL 
As it is dropped in front of a doorway. We SEE that the letter from Ted to Joanna is on top. 
TED (V.O.) I urge you to retain her. Her number is 722-8099, and I think she will take the job if it is offered. I'm sure other things will come up. Ask me what you need to and I guess eventually we'll talk... 
CUT TO: 
INT. JOANNA'S APT.  DAY 
ON HER 
As she finishes reading the letter. 
TED (V.O.) That's all I can think of, except to repeat what I said before, he's a terrific kid. I'm grateful for the time we've had together and I feel I am a better man because of my son... Ted. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BEACH  DAY 
It is a clear, cold beautiful winter's day. Ted and Billy walk 
along the beach at the edge of the water. THE CAMERA TRACKS WITH THEM. There are several beats of silence as Ted tries to think of how to begin. Finally: 
TED Billy, sometimes when a mother and a father are divorced, there's a discussion about who the child should live with, the mother or the father. Now there is a man who is very wise. He's called a judge. And a judge has a lot of experience with divorces and he decides who it would be best for the child to live with. 
BILLY Why does he decide? 
TED Because... Well, that's what he does. He's a very powerful man. 
BILLY Like a principal? 
TED Bigger than a principal. The judge sits in robes in a big chair... The judge has thought a lot about us, about you and me and your mom, and he has decided... (a deep breath) ...he has decided that it would be best for you to live with your mom Joanna in her apartment. (fake cheerful) And I'm very lucky. Because even though you'll live with your mom Joanna I'll get to see you once a week for dinner and a couple of weekends a month. 
BILLY I don't understand, daddy. 
TED (trying very hard not to cry) What don't you understand, pal? 
BILLY Where will my bed be, where will I sleep? 
TED At your mom's. She'll have a bed for you in your own room. 
BILLY Where will my toys be? 
TED I'll send your toys there and I'm sure you'll get some new ones. 
BILLY Who will read me my stories? 
TED Your mom. 
BILLY (worried) Daddy, what if The Face comes when I'm at mommy's? 
TED Your mom knows all about The Face, okay? Don't worry, she'll tell The Face to beat it. 
BILLY Will you come and say good-night to me every night? 
Suddenly Ted can't stand it any longer. 
TED Look, it's getting cold. Why don't you go inside where it's warm. I'll be along in a minute. 
Billy hangs back, watching Ted. 
TED Go on, scoot. 
The boy turns and runs back along the beach toward the house. 
Then, he stops, turns back to look once more at his father. 
HIS POV  LONG SHOT 
Ted stands at the ocean's edge, his back to CAMERA, weeping.

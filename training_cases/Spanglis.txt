Cristina taking a snack from the refrigerator..smiling at the note her mother left...lighting a burner and melting cheese on a tortilla. 
NARRATOR (CONT'D) 
But we were fine. We had it down. If only I could have stayed six. The CAMERA MOVES QUICKLY from the child to: 
23   EXT. APT. COMPLEX - ELEVATED SHOT - SIX YEARS LATER.       23 
The courtyard is lit with colored lights and candles..a wedding reception is in progress - 
EXTREME CLOSE UP - THE BRIDE. 
Gorgeous round and full cheeks stretched into a deep, explosive smile. BACK TO SCENE... music plays and we focus on Cristina, now nearing 12 years of age..dancing with her mother and some other smaller children.. The mother eyes the muscular back of a Great Looking Man...who turns, and quickly oozes quality sex appeal. She is turned on..They talk in Spanish...him saying something hushed like, "I have been afraid to talk to you. I need oxygen when I look at you." She indicates the six children she is dancing with and offers to include him in some ring around the rosey dance...He indicates the magic of just the two of them...She quickly leads her little flock away.. 
OTHER ANGLE.. 
A reed-thin FOURTEEN YEAR OLD BOY is staring at them...at first the mother thinks this is adorable...the child eyeing her as if he were a man..she indicates he should join the rest of the children for a dance.. 
MOVING WITH THE BOY.. 
As he steps forward and it becomes clear it is Cristina he is interested in... Before the mom can do anything about it, he asks Cristina to dance and she readily accepts. 
ON CRISTINA.. 
Satellite virginities falling with alarming speed..the first time held by a male, the first time held close, the first sexy (albeit touchingly awkward) gaze from half-closed male eyes which utterly confuses Cristina. He begins to grind his hips into his dancing partner. 
ON HER MOTHER. 
Not confused. It is exactly as if she sees her daughter about to be run down by a car..only this time the thing to do is scare the car. 
She runs toward the boy -- he sees the force of nature coming his way and makes a break but she gets him and actually lifts him and throws him to the sidelines. Then pats him on the head maternally and goes back to Cristina. 
CRISTINA. 
Somewhat proud of her mom as the boy leaves the scene. 
NARRATOR 
That quickly it was clear she could no longer work two jobs and leave me to my own at night. The following morning she did something about it. A boy I never saw again had changed our lives. 
24   INT. BUS - DAY                                               24 
The mother and her aunt, MONICA, take their seats..the bus is filled with domestics..the mother, nervous, looks over to see and greet... THE BRIDE from last night's wedding. 
25   INT. BUS - DAY - 90 MINUTES LATER.                           25 
BRIDE 
(to mom) Este es Stone Canyon. 
26   EXT. STONE CANYON - DAY                                      26 
MUSIC CHANGE..as they disembark and start walking, joining the busload of domestics into the canyon and up the hill....they walk past a perfect country club fairway. Grand trees from either side meet each other high over the road. 
ON OUR GAL..AS THEY WALK 
She sees the stuff...the dream that makes you migrate. She is not awed..she is jazzed. To her aunt she does the Latin version of OH.....MY...GOD!!!!!!!!...At regular intervals in the background, one black SUV after another has a mother taking kids home from school. 
27   EXT. ATTRACTIVE HOME SECURITY GATE - DAY                     27 
Monica presses the security intercom. The gate swings open. 
28   EXT. HOUSE - DAY.                                            28 
In the foreground an expanse of turned up dirt...and huge rolls of sod ready to be laid down. A catering truck stands in the driveway. 
29   INT. / EXT. HOUSE - GREAT KITCHEN / POOL - DAY               29 
They enter..lots of glass French doors STAND OPEN to lawn, pool and pool house. They look off. 
THEIR POV. 
DEBORAH NORWICH CLASKY, a cool beauty in her mid 30's, sits dominating this three generation portrait of the Good Life. She is wearing a straw hat and killer Hawaiian shirt..She is a perfect dresser; meaning her clothes seem to say she doesn't care, while every article is a true and gifted find. She is drinking from a tumbler which is also of the "don't hold your breath while you try to find something as terrific" variety. She is flanked by her mother, EVELYN, 60, who is drinking from a stemmed glass with two olives and her 14 year old overweight daughter, BERNICE..who is reading, her grandmother idly holding her hand..In the immediate area more rolls of sod wait to be laid. 
THE TWO LATINAS. 
As they stand inside the kitchen not sure what to do next. Then Deborah gestures that they should join her at the pool..as they start out.. 
THEIR EXIT. 
Boink..three stooges retro..those French doors were not open after all. Monica hits first. The women at the pool react. Deborah and Bernice running. Evelyn momentarily attempts to join the rush.. she half rises and then thinks better of it..too late in the day for sudden movements. 
KITCHEN DOORWAY. 
BERNICE 
Gee whiz in heaven...How are you? Please? 
DEBORAH 
(a bit hyper) Don't worry..I'm not mad...I was looking for decoration to put on the glass so people would stop walking into it and instead of taking what they had in stock, which was awful, I special ordered. I'll design something myself which I should have done in the fi... Our heroine, seeing the blood flow from her aunt's nose, gestures that Monica needs help not conversation. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
..and what difference does that make when your nose is bleeding. Shut up, Deborah. 
BERNICE 
Now you got it, Mom. 
Deborah grabs at paper towels, gets an ice pack from the freezer and then grabs some cash from a bowl in the kitchen..She has, moment to moment, the enormous desire to feel loved that only the seriously hard to love can experience. 
DEBORAH 
Here, take these. (second thought) Was that strange to give you money..I just felt badly that.. 
MONICA 
It's okay. She pockets the cash. 
30   EXT. HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY                                  30 
Moments later. As the group arrives at the outdoor table. Evelyn makes half-hearted incomplete gestures of shaking hands, nodding, indicating a seat...each simple act a test which she fails -- every gesture a bit too late and then some..simply too much for her to manage with the drinks under her belt. In the background workers roll out sod, the yard becoming more beautiful even as we look. 
MONICA 
She is my niece. She and her daughter live in the apartment I manage. Yolanda, who worked for you, lived there before she went back home. That's how I heard about the job. 
DEBORAH 
So who am I interviewing? 
MONICA 
Her. 
Flor..what I walk on? 
MONICA AND EVELYN 
Florrrrr. 
FLOR 
Florrrrr. 
BERNICE 
It means flower, right? 
MONICA 
Yes. Flower. Florrrrr. 
EVELYN 
Florrrrr. 
FLOR 
Florrrrr. Deborah is beginning to feel criticized...she takes a beat..eyes everyone with some hostility. 
DEBORAH 
(directly to Flor) Is there some school of the ear I'm flunking out of right now? Flor says to Monica, in Spanish, a tip to pronounce her name. Monica warns Flor to leave it rest..since Deborah is becoming clearly and strangely pissed.. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
What did she say? 
CLOSE ON FLOR... 
She feels the tension but, so far in her life, her own irrepressible personality has served her - so she moves forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance. She tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the first time, she is, through Monica, talking directly to Deborah. 
MONICA 
(translating) She says..If you curl your tongue and let it be loose you will have it..that it's hard for Americans.. She says it's great that you try so hard. Many people wouldn't bother. 
DEBORAH 
(an emotional pronouncement/her greatest accolade) She gets me.... She smiles at Flor, who returns the smile. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
You want some lemonade? Take some lemonade. She pours some for Flor and Monica. Then she closes her eyes and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort: 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Florrrrr. It is perfect..Flor grins at Deborah's victory...claps her hands together. 
FLOR 
(a Spanish word) Sublime. Deborah feels relief..free for a moment from the dark corridors of self-criticism..She is lighter, prettier, innocent..Wholly and completely attractive. 
DEBORAH 
Whew, dense but stubborn, right? Thanks. (an important declaration) What you just did with me is just what kids need..patience and encouragement. Alright, money... Bernice rises like a shot to take off.. 
BERNICE 
Goodbye, really.. (to Flor) Look forward to seeing you. As she leaves. 
DEBORAH 
(absently to Bernie) Love you... (then with not a monoseconds break) ... the job is six days a week, seven to seven..the kids and all housekeeping, how much a week would you like? Monica translates..Flor, embarrassed a bit by the directness, ducks the question..saying in Spanish -- "whatever you say.." 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
No.. This is an important question..if you ask for too little it means you don't value 
yourself..too much and you're taking advantage. (after Monica translates) So? Flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not without some native wit and style to maneuver around it. 
FLOR 
(extremely heavy accent) One thousand dollars. Deborah falls for it until Flor laughs..others join...Deborah now a big smile, snort of a laugh, putting her hand to her face and shaking her head. 
OTHER ANGLE.. 
As Monica uses Deborah's reaction time to, in mid-laugh, flash four fingers to Flor.. 
ON EVELYN. 
Catching the gesture and secretly indicating to Monica they should go for six. 
MONICA 
(firmly) Six hundred dollars. Flor shoots her a look of fear...a tense beat. 
DEBORAH 
Welcome to the family.. Deborah kisses her..sort of on the mouth. In the midst of Flor's delight she is thrown by Deborah's kiss...it is the first of many borders to be violated. 
31   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     31 
As Flor and Monica exit and can finally show their full joy. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
32   EXT. STONE CANYON - EVENING.                                 32 
JOHN CLASKY driving a smallish SUV. He is an upbeat, talented, successful man with an ego as balanced as a high- end watch; who loves his wife, kids and job. In other words, watch out, John. 
33   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 33 
As John pulls into the driveway next to a catering truck and exits his SUV carrying a large wrapped tray.. 
34   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 34 
As John moves quickly through the downstairs, he puts the tray on a counter where food servers are working. 
JOHN 
I brought some dessert. As he moves on, we see in the background the workers unwrap and react to a fantastic concoction. A caterer (who we may notice looks at him like royalty) falls in beside him and whispers to him. 
CATERER 
She came down to check on the party and realized the gardeners hadn't finished rolling the sod. 
35   INT. / EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT                  35 
JOHN'S POV - DEBORAH AND TWO FEMALE CATERERS. 
39   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY.                           39 
Bernice is making French Toast, doing something novel with the filling and the last cooking process. Some great idea which will have us making a mental note to try it at home. 
40   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS DAY - DAY                       40 
John opens Georgie's door again. 
GEORGIE 
Now? 
JOHN 
Yes..actual up.. Georgie gets up.. 
GEORGIE 
Morning, Dad. 
JOHN 
Yeah, good morning. 
GEORGIE 
You as mad at me as Mom 'cause of what happened? John pauses..aware his answer will have repercussions but integrity wins. 
JOHN 
No, Georgie, I'm not. 
GEORGIE 
Are you mad at me? 
JOHN 
Uh...okay, no.. 
41   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN DOORWAY - DAY                    41 
As Flor enters from outside. 
BERNICE 
Morning, good to see you. 
FLOR 
Morning. Good too. She notices the French Toast. 
BERNICE 
Try some. She demurs. Bernice holds out one slice on a spatula, indicating Flor should just tear a piece off which she does...One taste and she marvels -- her mouth dropping open at this kid's ability to make something mundane special..Bernice laughs. 
BERNICE (CONT'D) 
Thanks. Her mother enters on her way upstairs. She is thoughtful, tense and sweaty - her run having failed to exorcise her current demon. She greets Flor and then shakes her head, making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to Flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker. 
DEBORAH 
Tough day. Bernice prepares a plate for her mom while, in the b.g., a GOLDEN RETRIEVER named CHUM approaches Flor from behind with a ball in its mouth. Flor is checking out the kitchen... what's in each drawer, etc .....Deborah is impressed by the self-starter display and indicates same to Bernice. 
BERNICE 
I had an idea for a breakthrough in French toast so I made breakfast. I don't want to be teased about it.. No sarcasm. No tough love. Just try it and if by any chance you have a positive reaction... 
DEBORAH 
Right..mean ol' me. I can't play right now. I have to do something about your brother. 
BERNICE 
I had an idea for a recipe. When has that happened? I got up early to do this. At least taste it, for God's sakes! She does.. 
DEBORAH 
Oh, it's good...oh God, it's rich -- Oh God, it's good. 
DEBORAH 
(sudden alarm) By the way, you could do without this. The approval rug pulled out from under her, Bernice looks at her mother. But Deborah is unaware of having hurt her daughter because her attention has been diverted so that Deborah AND THE CAMERA LOSE FOCUS ON BERNICE as the teenager, distraught, moves from the room. 
DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D) 
NO..NO! FLOR!....Never do fetch. Chum is nudging Flor with the ball and Flor was about to accommodate him by taking it before Deborah's warning shout stopped her in mid-sentence. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
I mean it, NEVER! ON Flor's stunned reaction to the outburst. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
I'm not mad. I'm thinking of you. This is me being nice.. Then using her hands to demonstrate. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Just no taking ball from dog. (broadly) Trust me on that one. CLOSE UP ON Chum going nuts with Deborah's hand passing in front of his face ignoring how urgently he offers the ball. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
You and me. We are fine. Just a tip. (she gives her waist a little squeeze) Girlfriends. (Flor is totally confused) Could you make some coffee? Cafe? 
FLOR 
Yes. Deborah directs her to the most complicated cappuccino machine Italian overpriced artists ever devised. 
42   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - MASTER BATHROOM - DAY        42 
Deb in the shower...you have never seen so many shampoos, conditioners and bath balms...never seen so huge a sponge..such fluffy towels. 
Skylight over the shower allows a beam of God's warmth. There is a fireplace in the bathroom. The only significance of this being that these people have a fireplace in their bathroom. The woman who made it all happen is putting in a contact lens..She is upset. We see that she has one blue eye and one brown. 
JOHN 
This isn't an argument, honey. 
DEBORAH 
Yes. Yes it is. So stop being so maniacally calm. 
JOHN 
(emphatically) No..it's not. Because I understand your side. 
You work here and you don't speak any English at all? The sound of feet on the stairs..Deborah and Georgie enter. 
DEBORAH 
All she has to do is dial 9-1-1 and press two for Spanish. (even before she enters) Flor...John. (to John enunciating the name) This is Flor. 
JOHN 
(pronouncing it perfectly) Hi, Flor. Deborah reacts, grabs some coffee and pushes Georgie along. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
(to Deborah) Look, I'll take Georgie to school. 
DEBORAH 
No. I'm doing it..show Flor the ropes. Flor is trying to figure out what's expected of her then Deborah gestures impatiently for her to fall into step and come with her. 
47   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                           47 
The biggest, baddest, BLACKEST SUV..there is some subtle custom work so the vehicle impacts us in ways we cannot quite fathom. Deborah is wiping away a tear as she gets in and shares a woman to woman moment with Flor. 
DEBORAH 
Fuckin' hombres, huh? She sniffles. Flor nods uncertainly. A small voice from the back seat..Georgie.. 
GEORGIE 
I just didn't want to sing last night. 
DEBORAH'S VOICE 
(hurt) Yeah. Well you said you would..You said you wanted to. I asked you five times. Then when I have the whole party paying attention you refused. As she puts the car in gear...Georgie sings insanely well. But he's just two lines into an old blues standard: 
DEBORAH 
It doesn't do any good now, Georgie. She presses a button on her dash and a glass partition comes up between front and back seat thereby cutting him off in mid- song. Flor is utterly baffled by the notion of putting a divider between parent and child. But Deborah is calling for her to pay attention to the car's navigation screen.. a Spanish voice says, "route guidance system starting." 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
I've programmed it for Spanish.. Look, it will take you anywhere and then back home. If you figured out how to make coffee on that thing it's all downhill. The MALE SPANISH VOICE talks about imminent left turns. Flor is thrown by the amount of oddness..All the while Georgie is singing his little heart out in the back seat. Flor,amused by the boy, suppresses a smile...maybe the first time in her life she's had to suppress joy. But Deborah never misses anything. 
DEBORAH (TO FLOR) (CONT'D) 
This is stop gap..You, kiddo, you're going to have to learn English. 
48   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON                  48 
John cooking...the theory that nobody's sexier than when they are seen doing what they do best applies here.. In the BACKGROUND John's number two, PETER, the Sous Chef, being bossy and anal as he organizes his cooking and GWEN, who spends most nights trying not to show her enormous affection for John. At the moment, John's work is a strange mixture of art and cloddishness.....the hands blur with expertise...but he keeps dropping items.....each time a Latin kitchen worker, ALEX, 20, dives on the spillage..At one point they bump. 
JOHN 
Sorry... 
PETER 
(sharply to Alex) Not the best place to stand, fella. 
JOHN 
(to Alex) No. It's me. You're the new helper, huh.. 
ALEX 
I didn't mean to... 
JOHN 
No..no..it's okay. It's me being bugged. Two people head for John almost simultaneously. PEG, an arty looking woman in her late 50's..wild, scraggly gray hair, enters lugging an ice chest and the maitre d'. 
PEG 
You are going to be so happy.. The Maitre D' enters. 
MAITRE D' 
I have something very important to tell you. John makes a no-brainer of a decision pointing to the woman who promised happiness. She hefts her ice chest up on the counter. 
PEG 
Perfect cod this is John -- John, perfect cod..Best one I've seen all season and he was swimming twenty minutes ago. The fish is that special, a sentence that kicks out for a writer, the right brush stroke for an artist. You get it.. 
JOHN 
Knockout. (to Alex) You want to learn something? You want to pack it away? The kid nods.. he picks up the fish. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
Cradle it...Put it in the cooler but not on its side.. In the same position it swims. (important added thought) And check the ice pack..make sure it can drain away..if it can't the chlorine can hurt the flesh. Do all that and nobody can put a fish in the fridge better than you...and that's a solid start.. First day and you already did something perfect. 
KID 
(smiling) Yes, I understand. 
MAITRE D' 
Please. Now? 
JOHN 
Oh, sorry..I forgot. He whispers in John's ear.. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
Damn.. "ohhhh damn." 
PETER 
What, buddy, what? 
JOHN 
Victor spotted a food critic.. 
PETER 
From? 
VICTOR 
The New York Times..I'll bet they sent her out just for us. (hands John a slip) Here's what she ordered. 
PETER 
Look, if you're nervous take a walk.. 
I'm just drawing blanks. I'm embarrassed. It's my own fault I spent my time on math, which I'm lucky if I don't flunk anyway and.. 
JOHN 
The guy we are looking for is not a ruse.. 
BERNICE 
What's ruse mean? 
JOHN 
Phony. So this president was not a ruse..He was the real thing. 
JOHN 
(she looks at him blankly) Ruse?? 
BERNICE 
(enjoying her father's absurdity) Rusevelt..If I'd ever heard of the word before - that would lock it in..It's so stupid it might work anyway... Deborah enters followed by Flor. They are carrying several boxes of clothes... 
DEBORAH 
Surprise new clothes.. Bernie gasps..As she looks at a sweater.. 
BERNICE 
What'd I do right? 
DEBORAH 
Warehouse sale.. Bernice tries on the sweater over her T-shirt..and mirth ends..The sweater is tight...Bernice picks up a blouse and then skirt and checks the size. 
ON FLOR AND JOHN. 
As they are COUPLED BY THE CAMERA ANGLE as each catches on and is dumbfounded. 
ON BERNICE.. 
Whose style, wit and grace should not have to be used to deflect such trauma. But so be it, as, though mightily stung: 
BERNICE 
Thanks, mom..I'm glad you didn't get here a little earlier or else I wouldn't be able to tell you that your gift is a ruse. Please, excuse me.. She exits to her bathroom. 
51   INT. STAIRWELL - EARLY EVENING                               51 
Flor one step behind John and Deborah who are moving quickly down the stairs...John pissed..Deborah feeling the futility of anyone understanding her point even as she makes it. 
DEBORAH 
She's right between the two sizes..I thought about it..what am I supposed to do encourage her...what is it? - DENIAL? Or motivate her to get herself in shape. Flor tries to slide by..Something surreptitious in her behavior..Deborah suddenly turns to Flor. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Flor.. She holds out her hand in a "we women understand" gesture. Flor does not waver..just meets her eyes. 
FLOR 
Me puedo ir?..go..can go? 
DEBORAH 
(a bit nonplussed) Sure. Go. 
JOHN 
I'll drive you to the bus stop. And that fast they are gone. 
52   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - DAY                           52 
As John gets in his seat..then sees Flor approaching the door and hops out to open her door...apologizing as he goes. 
JOHN 
Sorry. I'm cracking. As he moves back to his side of the vehicle. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
(a shout) Shiiiiiiit! Flor hears this from inside and nods in agreement. 
53   INT. JOHN'S CAR - EARLY EVENING..                            53 
As they drive down the canyon. He is wildly frustrated. Even if Flor were not there, he would be talking to himself anyway, in the manner of bag ladies and all of us. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
I am running out of excuses for the lady of the house. Flor doesn't understand his words...yet fully agrees. But then John takes rein of his emotions. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
But you know, you gotta watch out for the times you think you're absolutely right..But, man, Bernice has finals tomorrow. She didn't need this one..And just that look on her face when she got the gifts-- (now his voice cracks; he grows wet-eyed) --like for a second she thought all her problems with her mother had been solved... Flor is flabbergasted..she peeks to see if he is actually crying. At first her heart is touched by John but then there is distinct disapproval (a real roll of the eyes) that the macho meter can read that low. He looks at her and she faces front quickly. 
NARRATOR 
My mother did not understand her male boss. His heart was good and he was rare in not flirting with her. But they were starkly different. Privacy and dignity were the same word to my mother. Naturally, when she found herself sitting next to a man who cried over his child's hurt she had no idea how to process the event. Meanwhile, he has stopped for traffic near the end of the canyon. Flor takes the opportunity to bolt. 
FLOR 
Gracias. She opens the door and starts to get out though the car is still rolling a bit... 
JOHN 
What are you doing? Let me take you all the way. Reluctantly she re-enters the car..It rolls another ten feet to her bus stop and she gets out again. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
How weird was this ride? Sorry. 
FLOR 
No es nada. He doesn't quite know what that means...indicates same in a little helpless gesture.. 
54   EXT. BUS STOP - EARLY EVENING..                             54 
As Flor is dropped off...the goodbye awkward. 
NARRATOR 
The job was taxing her. She had no template for confusion let alone frustration. While waiting for the bus, Flor suddenly turns and runs a few yards...and then back..and waves off the looks from her colleagues - many of whom are overweight..many of them adorable. All puzzled for the moment as they watch Flor unsuccessfully try to shake off her day. 
55   INT. FLOR'S APT. - EVENING                                  55 
As Flor enters -- kisses her daughter..distraught and distracted. She walks immediately to the refrigerator and takes out a chocolate cake and a bottle of milk...she cuts a huge slice of cake and puts it in front of her startled daughter..in Spanish riding her on being too thin..the daughter gestures at her mother's own slim figure. 
BERNICE 
Okay. I'll show you.. She steps behind a closet door to try the clothes on, muttering pessimistically before she does so. CAMERA STAYS ON 
FLOR.. 
BERNICE (O.C.) (CONT'D) 
Lovely way to start the day. World's most trim Mexican learns her first sentence and uses it to watch me grrrrunt my way into... And then....silence...Bernie, open mouthed, steps out wearing the clothes which fit like a glove. Flor beams..then laughs at Bernie's reaction as she keeps checking the waist and looks into the mirror. 
INTO MIRROR. 
To see Bernie in the foreground as Flor looks on..nods approval and leaves. 
ON BERNIE.. 
The fit of the clothes is as mystifying as it is nice..she picks up another shirt..checks the size tag and then studies it a bit. 
CLOSE UP SHIRT.. 
As Bernie's fingers find the barely visible holes where the buttons have previously been. 
63   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY                            63 
Flor at work..Chum, ball in mouth, comes to her and nudges her. 
FLOR 
(to dog) Lo siento. No. Chum, momentarily depressed, walks away..Bernie enters. She is a bit overwhelmed -- her voice breaking a bit even with one word. 
BERNICE 
Hey.. Flor turns..Bernie moves to embrace her. 
64   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER              64 
As John comes down the stairs..He looks apprehensive..From the den comes the sound of singing..it stops him from going out the front door as he turns to check it out. 
65   INT. DEN - DAY..                                             65 
John finds Evelyn and Georgie in their night clothes. They are singing an old song...something like "LUSH LIFE" - something preposterous for a nine year-old boy..but you can't knock the quality of the voices..world class. They see him and stop. 
EVELYN 
Every time he has a nightmare, I teach him one of my old songs. That way the nightmares have a purpose. 
GEORGIE 
But I don't have to sing it for anyone. 
JOHN 
Right. You're clear on that.. 
GEORGIE 
How many did you sell of this song? 
EVELYN 
(embarrassed in front of John) He likes to know that stuff. 
JOHN 
(to Georgie) She was huge. 
EVELYN 
Seventy-six thousand..which is great for a jazz album. They resume harmonizing. As John leaves, the song lyric making some comment on: 
66    EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                      66 
As John, growing tense, walks toward the front gate..Chum proffers a ball and accepts defeat as he bends down to pick up the New York Times. John's body chemistry launches a surprise attack...anxiety and dread...He takes his newspaper to a wire bench in the front driveway..He finds the section..opens to the page..and just like that his life changes forevermore. 
67    INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     67 
John enters..Georgie is going up the stairs..Flor putting out breakfast food. 
EVELYN 
You okay? 
JOHN 
(strangely) I am okay. (to Flor) Deborah around? 
FLOR 
She run. John nods and heads upstairs. 
67A 
67A   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - BERNIE'S ROOM - DAY 
He looks in Bernie's room. She is loading her backpack for school.. 
JOHN 
Hey, honey. 
BERNICE 
What's wrong? 
JOHN 
No..nothing...just that.. Georgie enters the scene.. 
GEORGIE 
A kid offered me a trade..Let me show you. 
JOHN 
Yeah.. 
He starts to follow him to his room. 
BERNICE 
Dad!!! He can wait. 
JOHN 
No..It's okay.. 
CRISTINA 
Wow..."John Clasky es el mejor chef en Los Estados Unidos.. 
FLOR 
(easily) Ah, bravo... 
74   INT. CLASKY MASTER BEDROOM - DAY.                            74 
The Claskys are engaged in sex. John's brief sounds are exuberant..they shift position so that Deborah is on top BRINGING DEBORAH INTO A CLOSE SINGLE. Suddenly her smile fades - she hits the skids. 
DEBORAH 
Oh, damn it --- what am I going to do? Everything seems so surely pointless... 
ON JOHN. 
This IS WEIRD. And then the small, distinctive sound of Deb's climax...then, in a relatively small voice. 
DEBORAH'S VOICE 
Okay here...okay there...good, good, good. She falls off him...an arm across her eyes, lying on her back down the bed from him... 
ON JOHN. 
Puzzling over what just happened..a few false starts forming his thought...then finally..hesitantly... 
JOHN 
Hey, Deb? 
DEBORAH 
(from the vortex of depression) Yeah? He scoots to her side. 
JOHN 
You know, I guess I got used to you getting a little blue after intercourse...But DURING..?? 
DEBORAH 
Something else I do wrong. She grabs something and starts walking toward the bedroom. 
JOHN 
You've gotta stop walking away. 
DEBORAH 
(turning) If I stay, I will say awful things to you that I might not even mean..You pick. 
JOHN 
See ya. She exits to the bathroom. 
75   INT. JOHN'S CAR - DAY.                                    75 
Very upset as he drives. Then comes to the red light at the end of the street and sees Flor walking with others. An awkward beat as he waits for the light to change and they acknowledge each other..the light remains red..she confers with another woman. 
FLOR 
(to woman) Yo leÌ la crÌtica buena. The woman tells Flor how to say it in English. 
FLOR (CONT'D) 
(parroting woman) I read your good review. He nods..still the light doesn't change. 
FLOR (CONT'D) 
It's nice. The light changes. 
JOHN 
Not so far...How you doing? The light has changed - cars are beeping..she is about to let him go off but realizes he will wait for her answer. 
FLOR 
I do fine. He nods and drives off. 
76   INT. RESTAURANT - DAY                                     76 
As he enters....the phone is going off the hook..As he passes the maitre d's desk. Their conversation is strangely hushed and very, very quick. 
VICTOR 
Should I stop answering? We're booked for two months solid. 
JOHN 
No, no, no, no, no....I want to keep some walk-in business..I want this to stay neighborhood. 
VICTOR 
Impossible. There would be riots..You should hear the desperation in their voices..Best day of my life. 
JOHN 
We'll serve a full menu at the bar then. 
VICTOR 
Then where do I put the people waiting for a table? It won't work. 
JOHN 
Do this for me. 
VICTOR 
There's no way. 
JOHN 
Do this for me or I'll set my hair on fire and start punching myself in the face. 
VICTOR 
Huh? 
JOHN 
Yeah..you're right...that was an unusual way for me to make myself understood..But you'll do the bar thing? 
VICTOR 
JOHN 
Hi. I'm John..It's good to see you. (to Flor indicating Cristina) Great.. 
DEBORAH 
(to Cristina) Hi. This is my daughter, Bernice..I'm Deborah..And out there...are Georgie and. 
As she turns to gesture toward her mother and son, Evelyn has almost reached them .. 
EVELYN 
I'm so glad to meet you. I'm a fan of your mother's. 
CRISTINA 
I'm Cristina. As all acknowledge each other Deborah tugs at Bernie's top which is half tucked in. 
BERNICE 
(kidding around but right on) No comparisons, please, no comparisons. Evelyn shoves her granddaughter for the self- deprecation..Flor says something to her daughter in Spanish. 
CRISTINA 
My mother says it's best if we get out of the way and put our things away. 
JOHN 
Have you ever been to the beach here? 
CRISTINA 
I've never been anyplace but Mexico and Texas.....before today. John goes to a big toy box and opens it up..it is filled with beach paddles, Frisbees and boogie boards. 
JOHN 
Here's the most important place in the house..grab this stuff whenever you want. 
CRISTINA 
(delighted) Thank you..thank you so much. 
DEBORAH 
Very little accent? 
FLOR 
(suspiciously) Que? 
CRISTINA 
(to Flor) Sin acento. 
Her mom, not crazy about the lack of accent to begin with, nods. 
CRISTINA (CONT'D) 
(to Deborah) Thank you..there's an A.P. total fluency class where they work you pretty hard at sounding American. Flor doesn't want her daughter to have an extended conversation with Deborah of which she doesn't understand a word. 
FLOR 
Cristina.. 
DEBORAH 
Right. Settle in.. 
CRISTINA 
Thank you. I am thrilled to be here. 
93   INT. MAID'S ROOM - AFTERNOON                                 93 
Deborah has re-decorated the room with casual brilliance...Flor is tense..distraught...her daughter giddy...excited over the sheets, the tv, the pile of towels..a chaise..She goes to work on her mother to go swimming....wanting her to appreciate the fun element of being here...the spirit of the kid such that Flor relents.... 
94   EXT. BEACH - EVENING                                         94 
Flor and Cristina, two sea nymphs, lit by the floodlights from the beach homes. 
OTHER ANGLE. 
John and Georgie in the waves..body surfing...they get to shore...John sees the two females..dashing in the water in their bathing suits..He remains hidden in a very shallow wave as they run in...then once they are in he starts taking off his wet suit hurriedly... 
ON JOHN.. 
As he suffers the cold -- Georgie enjoying every moment. 
95   EXT. CLASKY BEACH RENTAL - DAWN'S EARLY LIGHT                95 
Wave lights still shining..On a dune sits Cristina, looking out. 
96   INT. MASTER BEDROOM                                          96 
As Deborah steps out on the deck and sees Cristina. 
DEBORAH 
(in a loud whisper) Hey, Cristina...hey...hey..What are you doing up? Cristina looks around -- then up.. 
CRISTINA 
Oh, hi..so beautiful..I was just excited. 
DEBORAH 
I know..Would you believe I had to talk my husband into this? (no reply/then more pointedly) Would you believe I had to talk my husband into it?...do you hear me? 
CRISTINA 
Yes...I just .. (awash..a shy laugh) I didn't know what to say? 
DEBORAH 
(still calling down) Do you want to come with me? -- I'm going to the flea market. 
CRISTINA 
I don't know what that... 
DEBORAH 
It's the Rose Bowl... miles, actual miles, of great things for sale for God's sake...We can have brunch in Pasadena. 
CRISTINA 
His kind eyes. 
FULL SHOT.. 
This is real eye contact..two vaguely humiliated people finding real company for an instant. Without thought, she duplicates his gesture and pats his back. 
FLOR 
Simpático, yes. And when he seeks to add another pat, he misses, because she is out of her chair..(This is as intimate as John has been with another woman since he was married..) He calls out to stop her. 
JOHN 
Un momento, huh? She stops and turns to him. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
I'm really sorry this is happening. I just want you to know that. I am real sorry. He taps his heart as an indication of sincerity -- then a flash of worry that he has inadvertently come on to her. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
I didn't mean.. He makes a gesture of ardent love.. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
I meant.. Makes a person to person innocent gesture..She finds herself smiling. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
Well, the good thing about being an idiot is that every once in a while you cheer people up..Got to get to work. 
CAMERA STAYS WITH FLOR 
As he exits...thinks about John's demeanor, smiles again, shakes it off as her mind fills with concern for Cristina. 
101   EXT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - SUNSET.                    101 
Deborah's SUV loaded at the curb..She and Cristina begin to carry things in...(NOTE: Cristina's hair has been restyled.) 
102   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - DAY                        102 
Evelyn, Bernie and Flor are gathered in the living room. All staring at her. 
DEBORAH 
What? Something bad happen? 
ON CRISTINA.. 
Enormously anxious on reading her mother's mood. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Cristina, tell your mother I just played around with your hair..she can put it back..no hurt feelings. 
CRISTINA 
Not right now. Flor puts an arm around her shoulder, leading her off and speaking to her forcefully in Spanish. 
DEBORAH 
What? -- 
EVELYN 
You can't just take someone else's..... 
DEBORAH 
Nuh-uh, Mom..don't go there..or I'll go there and you know where "there" is. Evelyn stops on a dime. She leaves. Deborah crosses to Bernice, who is highly concerned about Flor, and puts an arm around her. A pleasant surprise.. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Can you believe what Flor is making this into..Shoot me if I ever get that hard to deal with. Bernice, unseen by Mom, does a long, muted, mock scream. 
103   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - EVENING                                  103 
MUSIC IN: Action, purpose, energy.. Flor is dictating in Spanish as Cristina writes it down in English on a pad. Cristina enormously uncomfortable. 
INSERT - THE PAD. 
The pad, in effect, lends subtitles to Flor's words. Cristina winces with the words she records even while punctuating perfectly. 
PAD WRITING 
You cannot take my child without my permission..And, if you had asked me I would not have given permission. Is this why you did not ask? Because you knew this. You have no rights over my private life. 
ON FLOR.. 
Reaching a decisive conclusion. 
PAD 
If you have any disagreement with this, I no longer wish to work here. 
ON CRISTINA'S LOOK 
This is awful news. 
ON FLOR. 
For a decisive nod of affirmation. She adjusts her daughter's hair to the way it was, takes the note and exits. 
104   INT. CLASKY RENTED BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY          104 
Flor enters in something of a fury and holds the letter out to Deborah, who hates being cornered in this manner. She actually places her hands behind her so as to avoid the note. 
DEBORAH 
What's this? Flor shakes the letter at her. 
OTHER ANGLE.. 
Showing Cristina hidden but looking on... like a stage prompter in the wings. 
FLOR 
For you. 
DEBORAH 
From? Flor with enormous emphasis stabs her finger at her own chest. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
You are not yourself...This was written in anger. You sleep on it and then if you still want me to have it -- fine..I don't think you will once calm and rational thought returns. Just sleep on it. Deborah exits to a bathroom and closes the door...leaving Flor in the hall with the letter..Cristina reveals herself and explains the situation to her mother. The last word we hear before scene's end is "mañana." 
JOHN 
Oh my God, you found a blue..Nobody finds a blue..You know how a blue happens? I mean, before the ocean blasts it for 30-40 years. Somebody had to throw away an old Milk of Magnesia bottle. You know what Milk of Magnesia is? 
CRISTINA 
Unfortunately. He smiles broadly. The kid's a trip. He likes her. 
JOHN 
So how much for the whole deal? 
CRISTINA 
(unable to look at him) Eleven hundred and one dollar. He reacts..then.. 
JOHN 
Okay. We'll finish dealing with it when I get home from work. She gasps.. 
114   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - ONE A.M.                                114 
Flor asleep -- Cristina awake, alert..footsteps. She hears John enter. She moves slowly so as not to awaken Flor. 
115   INT. HALLWAY - ONE A.M.                                    115 
As she enters from the back room and sees that John is walking into the kitchen. Her eye goes to the hall table on which there sits a fat envelope with her name on it. 
116   INT. CLASKY BEDROOM - ONE A.M.                             116 
John enters the bedroom to find a note from Deb that she will be late. He is disappointed. 
117   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT - ON CRISTINA                     117 
Not aware of being observed..opens the envelope and takes out a thick wad of cash..almost swoons..as she goes about hiding it..she is jolted by her mother's whispered incredulity... 
FLOR 
Cristina.. She turns...the wad of money in her hand.. 
118   INT. POCKET KITCHEN - LATE NIGHT                           118 
The best chef in America has just fixed himself a snack as a salve to his spirits. It's a little like Dagwood Bumstead as a culinary genius..This is a snack we will remember and copy...John is approaching a perfect moment...and this is a guy who appreciates simple pleasures to the fullest... 
119   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - LIVING ROOM                            119 
He carries the brilliant snack to the living room and is just about to take his first bite when he hears emotional Spanish voices approaching. He looks up. 
ANGLE ON FLOR AND CRISTINA 
As they enter. Cristina translating her mother's words. 
CRISTINA 
My mother wishes me to represent exactly what she says, nothing else. 
And so, for the remainder of the scene, Flor will speak in Spanish and Cristina will not only translate but render her mother's emotion, sometimes including body language. It is not only a translation but a reenactment. 
CRISTINA AS FLOR 
May I talk to you? 
JOHN 
You mean your mother.... Cristina nods...not comfortable breaking the rule of only speaking for her mother...She faces him, her back to Flor. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
(looking at Flor) Sure you can talk to me.. Cristina begins translating as her mother speaks in Spanish.. 
CRISTINA AS FLOR 
I don't have to sleep first? 
JOHN 
What's wrong? Flor waves the money..Cristina waves an empty hand as she speaks for her mother. 
CRISTINA AS FLOR 
Did you give this money to my daughter? 
JOHN 
I made this little deal..with all the kids to... 
CRISTINA AS FLOR 
(interrupting) Please.. Flor advances on him past her daughter so Cristina now translates from the background. 
CRISTINA AS FLOR (CONT'D) 
You don't tell or ask the mother when you give a child a fortune for looking on the beach for stones..what is the word for this.. 
JOHN 
Sea glass? On hearing the translation of "sea glass" an exasperated Flor turns so that her back is to John as Cristina admonishes him. 
CRISTINA AS FLOR 
No..not a name for the stones..a name for the act..what you did.. 
ON FLOR.. 
As she spits out the word to her daughter. 
FLOR 
EngreÌdo. 
ON JOHN.. 
As his eyes shift to Cristina fearing the word he will hear. 
JOHN 
Oh, no..engreÌdo's going to be rough. 
ON CRISTINA.. 
Reluctantly taking the emotional stance of her mother to deliver the word. 
CRISTINA 
(briefly being herself) It's hard to translate. She takes half a beat..finds the word and now spits it out. 
FLOR 
It is too far from our home. 
DEBORAH 
You could move in with us in town. 
FLOR 
Never, thank you... 
DEBORAH 
Okay, then don't..By the way..the phrase is "NO, thank you." 
132   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - NIGHT                                 132 
Flor has her earphones on listening to her English tapes..but she is enormously upset as she watches her daughter passionately pray in English..soon taking off the ear phones. 
CRISTINA 
Please, dear God..Enter my mother's heart and make her understand what this school would mean. 
FLOR 
Alright. I look. 
CRISTINA 
Amen. 
133   EXT. L.A. PUBLIC SCHOOL - FLOR AT CRISTINA'S SCHOOL - DAY 133 
Summer session - L.A. public school..ninety percent Hispanic. Through Flor's POV, the place is seen not as crowded and worn but as vibrant with community. 
134   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL - FLOR AT BERNICE'S SCHOOL - DAY     134 
Highly anxious and out of place, she sees the upper-scale students..five percent Latino...No brochure can do it justice. Overwhelmed by the implications, Flor's eyes tear. 
135   INT. FLOR'S ROOM - LATE NIGHT                            135 
Cristina sleeps. Flor sits on her bed - no thought of sleep. 
136   INT. BEACH HOUSE - LATE NIGHT                            136 
John enters, home from work ... as he passes Flor's door it opens and she steps out. Before she can continue on, she sees Evelyn at the foot of the stairs, carrying a glass of port. 
EVELYN 
Hi, Flor, want some port? 
FLOR 
No, thank you, Evelyn. 
EVELYN 
(going up stairs) Thanks for never judging me..Love you. Love everybody. That's what's killing me.. Sleep well. 
EVELYN'S POV. 
She sees Flor approach John. Evelyn looks thoughtful. 
137   INT. DEN - LATE NIGHT                                    137 
John is about to pour himself a stiff drink. Flor startles him. 
FLOR 
May I talk with you? 
JOHN 
Me? (she nods) Deborah will be home soon. I just talked to her. 
FLOR 
I need real talk..Is it okay? John does not answer immediately. The brief pause is noted. 
FLOR (CONT'D) 
No? 
JOHN 
Sure. 
FLOR 
Outside? Private? 
JOHN 
Sure..... (as they exit to beach with a nervous laugh) You have me a little worried... He glances back, hoping to have his fears assuaged, they are not. 
138   EXT. BEACH - NIGHT                                       138 
He sits..she stands, gorgeous..The wind gusts periodically blowing her dress against her body. He tries not to notice. 
FLOR 
You know about Cristina and your great school? 
JOHN 
Oh, it's happened. Is it driving you nuts? 
FLOR 
Yes, nuts. I have no idea what to do. Such an important thing. 
JOHN 
Yeah. 
FLOR 
It's a good school? 
JOHN 
Tops. It's tops. 
FLOR 
Through the unusual center window we see Flor and Cristina. Flor, at this moment, is assimilating against every fiber in her body. Cristina is excited, certain her life is taking an incandescent turn. Quite a contrast. 
140   EXT. STONE CANYON AND SUNSET - MORNING                    140 
As the bus stops...Bernice is across the street, along with some other kids and Deborah, who is wearing her running clothes..Flor and Cristina exit the bus... 
BERNICE 
(calling) You just made it...I was getting worried.. Deborah has a backpack loaded with books which she hands to Cristina.. 
DEBORAH 
I picked up your books yesterday.. (by way of explanation to Flor) This is one of Bernie's old..ancient backpacks. Cristina taking it... 
CRISTINA 
Oh, thank you.. As she shoulders it and almost falls over.. 
CRISTINA (CONT'D) 
(impressed with the heft) This is a great school. 
DEBORAH 
(to Cristina) I got you a little first-day-at-a- new-school present... A school bus appears and heads toward them putting a certain deadline pressure on the transaction. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
It's from me and....Bernice. (to Flor) Okay? It is a big day. Flor's uncertain reaction is taken as a yes. 
BERNICE 
(dry) What did we get her? Deborah hands Cristina a locket..then, noting Flor's expression. 
DEBORAH 
(to Cristina) It's from ALL of us. Your mother too. 
FLOR 
(to Cristina) It's not from me... 
Deborah does a good-natured "TAKE" accepting Flor's reaction as if it where an eccentricity..As Cristina and Bernice board the bus, Cristina generally says goodbye to both women, thereby depriving Flor of her own moment of passage with her daughter. 
DEBORAH 
Have a great year, girls.. (for Flor) This is so great. It fills your heart, doesn't it? Deborah turns and sees Flor has already started doggedly up the hill.. 
141   EXT. STREET - HILL - ANGLE ON FLOR...                       141 
Walking up the hill, blinking in disbelief at her own fury..Deborah in the background feeling a bit abandoned..Flor keeps walking toward the camera.. 
NARRATOR 
There is a terrible crisis which comes when your own personality is not equal to the challenge you face. When being who you are no longer works. Deborah has started to jog. As she approaches Flor, she calls for a clear path well in advance. 
DEBORAH 
Left...left. Flor does not alter course though she does start to walk faster... 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Left...left... Deborah is close behind now. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
LEFT! 
Suddenly, Flor breaks into a run..She is lithe and quick. 
ON DEBORAH... 
A blink of confusion...then something resembling innate satisfaction as she quickens her gait and...the Race is on. 
ANGLE AS DEBORAH DRAWS ABREAST OF FLOR. 
Strangely, she is interpreting this as closeness. She is genuinely warm. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
(to Flor) Why am I not surprised you're competitive? Deborah looks up the street at a delivery truck. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Oh, they're delivering my table. Flor stays on task ..forces her stride. She just needs to win so very much..that's all..to her current surprise, that's everything... 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
You are fast.. Better pace yourself though.. Flor, even more upset and provoked by the words now lets it all out... 
ON DEBORAH.. 
Realizing she may not be a certain winner...she is concerned as she goes after the rabbit. 
OTHER ANGLE. 
Showing the delivery truck as finish line in the distance... 
VARIOUS SHOTS.. 
Flor fueled by desperation. Deborah, relentlessly gaining, exhilarated. 
THE FINISH.. 
Decidedly anti-climactic..Deborah draws even -- passes her-- arrives at the house with a large margin of victory. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
(calling back) I love you for trying. 
142   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY                                  142 
She exits into her home. 
ON FLOR.. 
Bent over, hands on knees, sweaty, gasping for breath. Flor finally straightens up and, there being no other course, continues her walk up the hill, to work. 
NARRATOR 
When people exist under one roof, a tiny society forms..the stuff of 
(MORE) 
NARRATOR (cont'd) novelas: masters and servants unconsciously dancing in lock step so that, when things go wrong, traumas converge. 
EVELYN (CONT'D) 
John, better wait a minute. But John hears Deb's crying from upstairs.. 
JOHN 
(concerned) What the hell's wrong? 
EVELYN 
Nothing. In all futility, can I urge you not to go up there. But he is already moving quickly up the stairs..As he turns at the top of the stairs WE SEE THE DOOR CLOSE TO BERNICE'S 
ROOM. 
ON EVELYN.. 
EVELYN (CONT'D) 
(to herself) Denouement. 
152   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT...                           152 
John enters the room on the double...passes Deborah without knowing it..(she is partially obscured by the drape or some such). As he passes....camera HOLDS ON DEBORAH..she is a mess...goopy tear stains..seeing him and his concern brings her grief to a higher ground...a sinner humbled by goodness..a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability... 
JOHN 
Deb..Deb?..where are you? He is about to leave the room...she is about to let him but an instinct leads her astray once more. 
DEBORAH 
Here I am. 
JOHN 
Baby, what? 
DEBORAH 
"Baby?" Stay there, John...Sit down..I suddenly get what I have to do...I just have to get the guts. 
JOHN 
Is it absolutely necessary to make it this...this scary..can you just say it? 
DEBORAH 
Not so easy. 
JOHN 
(tender/ready for the big healing) Yeah..come on..it's me. We can talk. 
DEBORAH 
Do I ever hope so...I've been seeing another man for the last eleven weeks and it was nothing and I ended it tonight..At first it was just keeping an eye on the real estate market..Then it was...what? Me being insecure and looking for some ridiculous vali... 
ON JOHN... 
A shock victim..he holds up a hand to stop her.. 
JOHN 
Go -- hold on...hold on...I'm missing what you're saying..You can't just keep talking and expect me to follow it when you start the way you did....... 
DEBORAH 
Just what did you hear? 
JOHN 
Well there was the crack in the planet. That was noisy... She looks at him...a solid beat... 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
There's an actual noise in my head.....no kidding.. Briefly he does the noise... 
DEBORAH 
(slowly) I met him about... John holds up a hand to stop her...he needs to gather himself to hear this..She waits...and waits...as he waits he grows flushed and stunned with dread. Finally a word.. 
JOHN 
You.. She takes that as a cue to start.. 
DEBORAH 
I met him.. He puts up his hand.. 
JOHN 
If you talk that fast...I'll never hear you..there's a lot going through my mind....Have you said yet whether you slept with him? 
DEBORAH 
So far I've just been talking about a flirtation because the really important thing for you to know... 
JOHN 
Have you said yet whether you've had sex with someone else? Because I really am missing most of your words. So help me out here.. 
DEBORAH 
I've been trying to explain that for the first ten weeks there was almost nothing to ... 
JOHN 
(sincerely checking but wild) You still haven't said, right? 
DEBORAH 
Is this your way of... 
JOHN 
This is my way of...this is my way of asking you whether.. He stops... staggering on the threshold of a diminished future. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
Oh man, once I ask it...give me a second. (several beats then some conversational good manners for keeping her waiting) I'm just trying to figure out whether there's any way to avoid knowing..no, damn (quickly closing this argument with himself) There's not... (to her) Okay, you're on..real short answer, huh? Have you had sex with another.. 
DEBORAH 
I know you're very angry? 
JOHN 
If you truly don't know why I say "no" let me at last say the reason. At least that will be a relief. Have you no idea that I.... 
Before she can there is the sound of scratching toes on the floor and a ball comes into lower frame with a dog's snout..Flor loses her thought and tosses the ball. 
OTHER ANGLE. 
As Chum, now the only happy creature in the house, fetches it and returns. 
JOHN 
Look I have to get out of here right now.. 
FLOR 
Go.. John exits to driveway...Flor makes one last toss..these tosses have not made a dent in her anger and frustration. 
FLOR (CONT'D) 
Goodbye, Chum. Another toss and Flor follows John out the door. 
ON CHUM. 
No longer happy. He has lost his only easy mark. He stares at the closed door..the ball drops from his mouth to the floor. 
158   EXT. CLASKY DRIVEWAY - NIGHT...                             158 
John is at the car but Flor heads for the gate. 
JOHN 
(as decisive as we've seen him) I'm taking you. 
FLOR 
(with anger) Why?!? 
JOHN 
Because if I don't -- I'll worry about you and I can't handle that right now, okay? Flor emits a crooning sound. 
FLOR 
Ahhhhh. (stunned and worried) I never made that sound over a man before.. 
Flor shudders at her own sappiness as John opens the passenger door for her...very much into his own torture he nonetheless grabs her arm and guides her up and in..she catches and appreciates his automatic gracious manners while he is clearly fucked up...She is impatient with his solicitousness almost slapping his hands away as he makes sure her skirt doesn't get crushed in the door..The frustration roiling in her. 
FLOR (CONT'D) 
Please!?! Mandilón. 
OTHER ANGLE.. 
Deborah watching them... 
HER POV. 
Her cuckolded husband closing the door behind her gorgeous, soon-to-be ex-housekeeper. 
CLOSE ON DEBORAH.. 
She trembles under the force of imminent justice. 
159   INT. JOHN'S CAR - LATE NIGHT                                159 
Two pissed-off people..jaws set...breathing labored..As the car starts and Flor looks back, she lets out a guttural and explosive shout... 
FLOR 
(a quick and mighty vent) Arrchhhhhyeeeeiii! For John, the first clear thing he has heard in a while.. 
JOHN 
Yes! Exactly! Well put! Teach me that word sometime. I can really use it. She nods..there is almost a moment of relaxation..then the anger fires an immediate need..She leans across the seat to deliver an urgent message to him. The words come out exponentially too forcefully. 
FLOR 
I quit this job! His spontaneous and forceful reaction surprises her.. 
JOHN 
I quit this job!!!!! As he turns onto Sunset. 
FLOR 
That's the bus stop. 
JOHN 
I'll take you home. 
FLOR 
No. Drop me at a bus. 
JOHN 
Oh, shut up and stop telling me what to do. 
FLOR 
Okay...then let's do something besides driving me home where my daughter isn't. 
JOHN 
Okay..we'll do something. 
FLOR 
And I'm supposed to figure out what because I'm a housekeeper and you don't have to think. 
JOHN 
Oh, don't do the class thing, man..You don't know where I come from. 
FLOR 
Alright, I know. But I can't be responsible no more for making sure nothing happens. That's another terrible job I quit. 
JOHN 
What are you talking about? I take responsibility for anything within a block. You have nothing to worry about. That's my job. 
FLOR 
Excellent. So you're going to figure out what we do, right? 
167   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT...                          167 
He is cooking..He is talking to himself. 
JOHN 
Nothing to be nervous about. You are not on a date... (calls out) Hey, Flor? 
FLOR'S VOICE (O.S.) 
Yes, John. 
JOHN 
What are you doing? She enters the room...dancing a bit.. 
FLOR 
Just lighting candles and picking music. (notices his cooking) Oooh. She gets up on one of the counters and sits there, her feet dangling...sings along a bit in Spanish. He is uncomfortable anew. The nervousness mounting. 
JOHN 
You want a drink? She considers the question totally..He is busy cooking..not realizing how weighty she considers his question...finally aware she has not answered and looks at her.. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
Huh? She regards him levelly..then makes her decision. 
FLOR 
No. He gets out a bottle of vodka. 
FLOR (CONT'D) 
I, uh...don't think you should either. 
JOHN 
Then excuse me, because if I had the equipment I'd inject the vodka. He starts to pour. 
FLOR 
Wait! (he stops) I think it is so important that we are each clear-headed. He looks at her..a beat...he puts the vodka away. Flor beams..we have not seen her smile like this for quite some time. 
FLOR (CONT'D) 
It is very good that you did not ask, "why?" 
JOHN 
(quietly) Keep things real, right? 
FLOR 
(impressed) I wouldn't have put it so well. 
168   INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - HALF HOUR LATER - NIGHT           168 
They sit at a small table in the kitchen..finishing the greatest late-night meal in the history of Western man. 
FLOR 
I will remember every taste..forever. 
JOHN 
Tell you the truth..I wanted a shot at cooking for you. (shy/his heart) I'm very glad you liked it. 
FLOR 
It's something watching you. He looks up at her...she has not been seen like this for a very long time, if ever.. lit up by a man. 
JOHN 
Well, if it's anything at your end imagine over here...scratch that..the last thing you want to hear is somebody going off on your looks. 
FLOR 
Don't be crazy. Tell me every detail. 
JOHN 
Okay, Flor, yes I will...They should name a gender after you..Looking at you doesn't do it..Staring is the only thing that makes sense..and trying not to blink so you don't miss anything. She squeals with laughter..He laughs a little himself and in so doing loses his courage..He looks down at his hands..shyness again belting him a good one..Still looking down. 
JOHN (CONT'D) 
Look..forgive me..I'm.....It's just that you are drop-dead, crazy- gorgeous..so much so that I am really considering looking at you again before we finish up here. 
FLOR 
Soon, please. And now he looks at her. 
CLOSE ON FLOR.. 
Utterly open...utterly optimistic...the half second before being swept away. 
FLOR (CONT'D) 
Right now....immediately..we have to dance or kiss. He stands. She stands..He kids just a bit, clowning at weighing the two options and then: 
HIS POV.. 
Her face.. 
JOHN 
No contest. They kiss. 
FLOR 
You sure you're not Mexican. 
JOHN 
(smiling/he likes this) What do you mean? 
FLOR 
I meant you talk like a Spanish song. 
JOHN 
You kiss like a Spanish fly.. (on her confusion) Joking around. I don't know what I'm talking about... 
FLOR 
FLOR 
Yes you do. Be honest. 
JOHN 
I'm being honest. (indicates their bodies) Look at us - I think I call it honesty. 
FLOR 
What are we going to do -- go home, let our hearts go back in our bodies, see each other a few more times. Make a tragedy out of us.. She kisses him again...starts to cry....looks at him..emits a small cooing sound. 
FLOR (CONT'D) 
Ahhhhhhh. (sudden energy) There are some mistakes you cannot risk when you have kids...Please, are you ready to go? 
JOHN 
(urgently) No. I'm not. No. (then) Stay put for a second. Stay here. Once our feet touch that floor, I'm going to get too many brain cells back. So don't be in such a hurry. That floor, Flor, is going to eat us alive. (she settles back/he is energized) So you think it was a mistake up to now. (she nods "yes") That's rough. She nods again..trying to gut things out...but as her foot touches the floor, she must say one last thing to him. 
FLOR 
The mistake....I love it. 
173   INT. CLASKY HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT.          173 
Deborah's face is bleached from crying...the tear ducts of her now brown eyes are parched dry..Evelyn sits eyeing her as she looks through the window at the pre-dawn emptiness of Stone Canyon. In her current shape she would give pause to a staff worker at Promises..a shock victim walking through the rubble after the bomb has dropped. Deborah's voice is scratchy when she speaks. 
DEBORAH 
Tell me again why I can't call him on the cell. 
EVELYN 
Besides that he turned it off? 
DEBORAH 
Yes. 
EVELYN 
Forty messages start to look needy. 
DEBORAH 
Mother, you're enjoying this. 
EVELYN 
No..Definitely not in the way you think. 
DEBORAH 
(staggered) You are enjoying it?!? 
EVELYN 
(rising/honest) I am enjoying actually being of use to my daughter. I am enjoying the fact that I really know how to advise you and the miracle that you are so deeply disoriented that you are gobbling up everything I say. Deborah nods in agreement -- then looks at her mother in a somewhat new way..as if Evelyn were an actual person instead of an upsetting extension of herself. 
DEBORAH 
(vulnerable) There's one thing I'd like to say to you about you and me. 
EVELYN 
You don't have to. 
DEBORAH 
I want to. 
EVELYN 
Okay. 
DEBORAH 
(quite vulnerable and appealing) You were an alcoholic and wildly promiscuous woman during my formative years so that I am in this fix because of you. It is your fault. I just needed.. (gestures heart to heart) ..that moment for us. 
EVELYN 
You have a solid point, dear. But right now the lessons of my life are coming in handy for you. 
DEBORAH 
There's a car coming.... Evelyn moves to her. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
It's him...he's got to tell me everything.. Evelyn shakes her head "no." 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
(wild-eyed) Yes! 
EVELYN 
Do you know that right now you are your own worst enemy..that you can't trust one thought in your brain? 
DEBORAH 
Duh. 
EVELYN 
Then trust me and only allow yourself to say one thing to him..One thing..."I'm so glad you're back." 
DEBORAH 
Huh? 
EVELYN 
Yes. 
DEBORAH 
(babbling) But I've got to know whether he touched her - where he touched her - how he touched her - if they broke a sweat --- what they said - who made the first move - how they left it -- if anyone loves anyone or has an intention of making contact in the future - what she wore - how he felt afterwards - whether anyone mentioned me.. (a wail) ..whether they held hands when they left.. The distinct sound of a door opening and closing from downstairs. 
EVELYN 
Just those words I said. If you want a prayer of coming out of this. 
DEBORAH 
Like? 
BERNICE 
(a big grin) Surviving. 
JOHN 
You're fantastic, Bernie...I love you. 
BERNICE 
It's a slant... (pause then) Hey..I know there's a lot you went through but I knew all along that Grandma was right about you coming back..I mean totally knew it so I wasn't that worried. But still I... (some emotion out of hiding) I really appreciate it, Dad. Thanks....Stop staring at me..what? You don't know what to say? 
JOHN 
Right. I don't know what to say. 
BERNICE 
Just what you taught me..You're welcome. 
JOHN 
You're welcome. They kiss. 
178   EXT. STONE CANYON -     MORNING.                           178 
Flor purposefully walking up the hill.. 
179   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                   179 
As Flor enters...walks through a few empty rooms..then once in the kitchen she sees the children and Evelyn are swimming in the pool...she opens the glass door Monica bumped into on interview day. 
180   EXT. CLASKY POOL - DAY.                                    180 
Evelyn, Bernice and Georgie are in the pool..Cristina, wearing a bathing suit, is on a chaise reading... 
CRISTINA 
Hey, mom...Is it okay if we don't leave right away? The others call greetings..save Evelyn who studies the situation and gets out of the pool..Flor is awkward..no idea how to handle this...so she goes direct. 
FLOR 
No... (as Cristina begins to protest) No..and we must say "goodbye." I don't work here anymore. She then talks Spanish to Cristina..admonishing her not to embarrass them..something about Flor being prepared to go nuts all over her daughter if she hurts their dignity...but it is said with total calm. 
GEORGIE 
Do I have to get out? 
FLOR 
No, Georgie..Stay. I think you are a wonderful boy..be good..like you are. There are no monsters. 
GEORGIE 
Thanks..thanks. Okay. Bernice climbs out of the pool. Meanwhile, a flabbergasted Cristina is staring at her mom who gives quiet two and three word proddings in Spanish. 
BERNICE 
(severely to Georgie) I can't believe you didn't get out. 
GEORGIE 
Flor said. 
BERNICE 
(to Flor) I don't want to get you wet. 
FLOR 
Get me wet. 
BERNICE 
(rushing to hug her) Thanks. Bernice hugs her. Evelyn hugs Cristina.. 
EVELYN 
You...are...a...trip. 
FLOR 
(to Bernice) You're a beauty. Amazing girl. 
Despite herself, Bernice starts to cry..moans to herself over the display...Now, in the background, we hear a subliminal human voice. Incrementally it will grow louder and be recognizable as Deborah calling Flor from the master bedroom window..Bit by bit, the others will become aware of this as Flor ignores it...Bernice goes to embrace Cristina. 
BERNICE 
My last chance to have some of you rub off on me.. (Cristina doesn't understand) I'm sorry you're so sad but this could have been so much worse. 
CRISTINA 
(from her depths) How? And now Deborah calling "Flor" is getting hard to ignore but Flor manages.. 
EVELYN 
(to Cristina) Why don't you run upstairs and say goodbye to Deborah? Flor flashes a look of thanks. 
FLOR 
I'll be in front. Upset, Cristina runs off. She kisses Bernice..and walks toward the house. As she passes under the bedroom.. 
DEBORAH 
Please come see me. And then a crying Cristina appears on the deck. Flor glances up and keeps moving underneath the deck where she faintly hears the beginning of their exchange 
DEBORAH'S VOICE 
It's okay, honey..we'll see each other at school..I'm going to keep an eye on you..I will. Flor enters the house... 
181   INT. KITCHEN - DAY.                                         181 
She stands waiting..walks to the hallway and cranes her head to see into rooms, wondering if John is there. Finally, as she passes the stairwell, she sees Cristina on an upper landing and says, in Spanish, that Cristina should get her things and meet her out front. Cristina, agitated, moves off to comply...then Deborah appears in the same spot. 
DEBORAH 
Please stick your head in here for a minute. Flor nods and starts up the stairs... 
182   INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY                                   182 
Deborah holds open the door while Flor walks inside..then closes it. 
DEBORAH

FADE IN: 
EXT. QUADRANGLE - DAY 
LONG SHOT The quadrangle of Army buildings is quiet and deserted. A broken-down taxi drives in at one corner and slowly makes its way around the quadrangle. SUPERIMPOSED over shot is the LEGEND: 
HAWAII, 1941 SIX MONTHS BEFORE PEARL HARBOR 
The taxi pulls up across the street from camera. A soldier gets out, pulls two heavily loaded barracks bags after him. He pays the driver, hoists the bags to his back, moves toward camera. The taxi drives away slowly. The soldier walks toward steps leading to a low building. He is PREWITT (called "PREW" for short), 22 years old, well-built, good-looking. He wears an enlisted man's uniform and on the sleeves are marks where chevrons have been removed. He pauses, looks up over the door. CAMERA PANS UP to sign which reads: ORDERLY ROOM - G COMPANY, 219TH REGIMENT. 
MEDIUM SHOT A small thin soldier in an undershirt and fatigue pants backs out of the screen door and into shot. He is wielding a frayed broom. This is PRIVATE ANGELO MAGGIO. He is violent and funny and sour and friendly. He sees Prewitt's legs but not his face, speaks as he sweeps a cloud of dust off the porch. 
MAGGID Fine way to pass the time. Good for the mind. 
PREW Hello, Maggio. 
Maggio turns and stares at Prew, astonished. 
MAGGIO Prew...? 
PREW (NODS) I transferred out of Fort Shatter. 
Maggio notices the marks on the sleeves where the stripes have been removed. Prew follows his glance. 
MAGGIO You quit the Bugle Corps...? 
Prew nods. Maggio jerks his head toward the sign. 
MAGGIO To here...? 
PREW (SHRUGS) That's what the orders say. 
MAGGIO You made a bad mistake. This outfit they can give back to Custer. 
Prew smiles slightly, starts toward door. 
MAGGIO The Captain ain't in yet. 
Prew puts down his barracks bags. 
PREY I'll look around. 
MAGGIO (smiles for first time) Maybe we borrow some money from a twenty per cent man and take a real trip to town some night. 
PHEW Maybe. 
TRUCKING SHOT ALONG COMPANY STREET Prew walks slowly down the raised porch alongside the street. He takes the mouthpiece of a bugle from his pocket, jiggles it idly, a habit of his. He comes to the Dayroom, glances through the screen door, goes in. 
INT. DAYROOM - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT The Dayroom has a pool table, ping-pong table, a radio, etc. Moth-eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. The place is empty as Prew enters. He looks around casually, sees the pool table in an alcove. He moves over to it, puts the bugle mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the wall. He switches on the light, chalks the cue. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT The triangle of balls is already racked on the table. Prew addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly. He watches the balls hurry around the table. 
WARDEN'S VOICE (O. S.) What're you think you're doing!? Why ain't you out in the field with the Compny? What's your name? 
The voice is brawling, brash, vigorous. Prew turns slowly. CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to INCLUDE FIRST SERGEANT MILTON WARDEN, almost at Prew's elbow. He is thirty-four, big and powerful, has a neatly-trimmed moustache. 
PREW Prewitt. Transfer from Shafter. 
WARDEN Yeah. I heard about you. 
PREW I heard about you, too, Warden. 
WARDEN Well, put up that cue and come along. This here's a rifle outfit, Prewitt. You ain't suppose to enjoy yourself before sundown. The Man's very particlar about little things like that. 
Warden goes out of the Dayroom. Prew puts up the cue and follows him. 
EXT. COMPANY STREET 
TRUCKING SHOT as Prew and Warden walk along the porch, Warden a few paces ahead. They go into the Orderly Room. 
INT. ORDERLY ROOM - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT as Prew and Warden enter. Maggio is sweeping the room. MAZZIOLI, a bespectacled, intellectual-looking Private First Class, is at the clerk's desk, opening it, taking out papers, etc. Prew sits on a bench as Warden goes over to Mazzioli. 
WARDEN Mazzioli! Grant went to the hospital yesterday. Did you make up his sick record? Did you make a note for the morning report?! You're the Compny Clerk. The lousy Sickbook is your job! 
MAZZIOLI Those medics didn't get the Sickbook back till late yesterday -- I'll tend to it right now -- 
WARDEN Thanks. I already done it for you. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Maggio has swept his way over to Prew. He stops sweeping now, stares at the other man as if still incredulous. 
MAGGIO But you the beat bugler they got over at Shatter. You probly the best on this whole Rock. 
In b.g., Warden has turned from Mazzioli and is looking at Prew. Prew looks back coolly, answers Maggio thoughtfully. 
PREW They don't. 
HOLMES Would you have us disband our fighting program because one man got hurt? 
PREW No, sir. I dint say -- 
HOLMES You might as well say stop war because one man got killed. Our fighting program is the best morale builder we have off here away from home. 
PREW I don't want it disbanded, sir. (DOGGEDLY) But I don't see why any man should fight unless he wants to. 
HOLMES It looks to me like you're trying to acquire a reputation as a lone wolf, Prewitt. You should know that in the Army it's not the individual that counts. If a man wants to get ahead he has certain responsibilities to fulfill that go beyond the regulations. It might look as though I were a free agent, but I'm not. Nobody is. 
Holmes waits hopefully for a moment, then realizes Prew is not going to respond further. He stands. Prew snaps to attention. 
HOLMES Maybe you'll change your mind. In the meantime just don't make any mistakes in my outfit. (TO WARDEN) I've got to go into town. Is there anything else for me today, Sergeant? 
WARDEN (holds up papers) Yea, sir! The Compny Pond Report's got to be made out. It's due TOMORROW -- 
HOLMES You make it out. Is that all? 
WARDEN (holds up more papers) No, sir! 
HOLMES Well, whatever it is, you fix it. If there's anything that has to go in this afternoon, sign my name. I won't be back. 
He goes out, crossing Warden's desk and knocking a wire basket filled with papers on the floor. In a moment, the sound of the screen door slamming is heard. Warden picks up the papers. 
WARDEN He'd strangle on his own spit if I weren't here to swab out his throat for him. (TO PREW) Come on. I'll show you the Supply Room. 
Warden goes out to Orderly Room, Prew following. 
INT. ORDERLY ROOM - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT as Prew and Warden enter and walk through. Maggio bobs his head approvingly at Prew. 
EXT. COMPANY STREET - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND PREW as they come out of the Orderly Room. Prew hoists his barracks bags to his shoulders, balancing them delicately. CAMERA TRUCKS with him and Warden as they walk down the porch. 
WARDEN (one of his unexpected INTENSE BURSTS) Know what you did just now? (MORE) WARDEN(CONT'D) When you turned down Dynanite Holmes' boxing squad? You put your head in a noose. Things are soft for a boxer in his Compny. Otherwise, you better know how to soljer. 
PHEW I can soljer with any man. 
WARDEN This ain't the Bugle Corps -- this is straight duty. 
PREW I'll take my chances. 
A convertible, top down, drives by and pulls up outside the Orderly Room. KAREN HOLMES, a tall, lean blonde woman, gets out. Her skirt hikes up a little as she goes up the stairs to the Orderly Room. Warden and Prew stop walking and watch her. Karen stops, glances at Warden momentarily, then goes into the Orderly Room. 
WARDEN Since when is this place gettin to be the Royal Hawaiian? 
PREW Who's she? 
WARDEN His wife. Captain Holmes'. 
They resume walking. 
WARDEN You'll fight, Prewitt. You'll fight because Captain Holmes got a bee in his hat he needs a winnin team to make Mayor. And if you don't do it for him you'll do it for me. I only been in this outfit eight months myself but I learned one thing. My job is to keep him happy. The more he's happy the less he bothers me and the better I run his Compny. So we know where we stand, don't we, kid? 
PREW I know where I stand. I don't believe that's the only way a man can get along. (MORE) PREW(CONT'D) A man's got to make up his own mind and go his own way. It he don't, he's nothin... 
WARDEN Maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way. But not in our time, kid. Today you got to play ball. You got to divide it all by two. 
They have reached a Dutch door, top half open. A sign over it reads: SUPPLY ROOM. 
MEDIUM SHOT SHOOTING INTO SUPPLY ROOM SUPPLY SERGEANT LEVA is eating a candy bar with one hand and leisurely typing up a form with the other. He is a foolish- looking man, about thirty-five. 
WARDEN Lava! Can't I once walk by this Supply Room and find you workin with both hands! 
LEVA (comes up to door) I can't do no better on what you people pay me. 
WARDEN Draw some supplies for this man. (TO PREW) That's G Compny barracks over there. Get rid of your bags and come back here, and Leva'll find you a cart to lug your stuff over in. Save you makin four five trips. 
PREW (surprised, pleased) Okay. 
WARDEN I just hate to see energy wasted. Any kind. Besides, you'll be needin yours. 
Prew walks off, toting the barracks bags. The bang of the Orderly Room door is heard and Lava and Warden look in that direction. 
LONG SHOT KAREN HOLMES FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S ANGLE as she walks along porch toward them. She is at a considerable distance. Karen is about thirty. She wears a 
sweater and skirt. She is aware the men are studying her. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN AND LEVA watching Karen. Leva leans over the counter. 
LEVA Her and them sweaters. 
LONG SHOT KAREN FROM WARDEN AND LEVA'S POV as she continues toward them. As much as a man can make out, she is probably not wearing a brassiere. Warden's and Lava's voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer Karen gets to camera. At end of the shot, as she is only a few yards away, they are practically whispering. 
WARDEN'S VOICE Army women... They're cold, they got no more warmth than a diamond. There's no pleasure in them... 
LEVA'S VOICE Yeah, but this one knows the score... Like I been tellin you. 
WARDEN'S VOICE (SARCASTIC) Is that right? 
LEVA'S VOICE Okay, not around here. But I was back at Fort Bliss with Holmes. When they was married only a year or two. I heard plenty about the lady then. Plenty. 
He moves over to her. 
HOLM ES How many times do I have to tell you I'm sorry, about that? How many times that I had no way of knowing - 
He puts his hands on her shoulders. Karen shakes away, rises, faces him. 
KAREN You had a way of knowing, Dana. I want to go to bed. Please get out of my bedroom. 
Holmes looks at her sullenly, then exits to adjoining room, closing the door behind him. There is a moment of silence, then a sharp snap as Karen breaks the comb in two. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DAYROOM - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN The room is fairly well filled with soldiers. The click of pool balls is heard over shot. Warden is reading a newspaper.. A column heading, conspicuous in shot, reads: JAPS ADVANCE IN CHINA. Warden drops the paper on his lap, looks toward pool table, squinting thoughtfully. 
FULL SHOT AT POOL TABLE Maggio, Prew and CHIEF CHOATE, a Corporal, are playing pool. Choate is a full Choctaw Indian, a man of great bulk and tolerance. He speaks in a tremendously deep bass voice. The 
table on one side is surrounded by the prizefighters of G Company. They are IRE GALOVITCH, an ape-like, bent-kneed man weighing about two twenty, with a widow's peak almost to his eyebrows; BALDY DHOM, chunky and tough, his head as bald as an orange; TURP THORNHILL, a stringy, chinless Mississipian; HENDERSON, a tall, hard Texan; CHAMP WILSON, wiry and good- looking. They are all Sergeants except Wilson, who is a Corporal. The men have been heckling Prew and are watching with cold belligerence. Choate, bending over his cue, shoots and misses. 
CHOATE I'm coldern a Idaho winter tonight. 
Prew shoots, makes a brilliant shot. 
MAGGIO Man, what I would not give to have this character in the corner poolroom in my home town: I'd dress him up on overhalls and a straw hat and put a grass in his teeth, and I would make a whole mint of ghelt off him! 
Choate laughs deeply. Prew sizes up a new shot. 
WILSON We'd of won last year if we had a good middleweight. You box as good as you used to over at Shatter we're a cinch this year. 
Prew doesn't respond. He bends over his cue again. 
THORNHILL You ain't forget the Division champs get ten day furloughs, did you, son? Ey? 
GALOVITCH You no talk now, Prewitt. But out in field with us you sing different song. An don't think you are tough guy. Quickest way to stockade is BEING TOUGH guy. 
HENDERSON You heard him. Better think it over. 
MAGGIO Lissen, it's his right not to fight if he don't want. Without bein kicked around. Now, we playin pool. Whyn't you take off? 
DHOM You want a busted head, Maggio? 
MAGGIO (SERIOUSLY) No. 
DHOM Then keep your big nose out altogether. (turns back to Prew) Trainin season starts next week -- 
Prew has been growing more and more agitated, as much by an inner turmoil as by the men. His control snaps suddenly. 
PREW I told you I quit fightin! I'm through! An that's all she wrote: You guys want to put the screws on, go ahead. I can take anything you hand out! 
DHOM Okay, Prewitt. No halts barred. 
The five men move off, file out of the Dayroom. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN His paper still on his lap. He has been watching. He wears a faint smile of respect. 
MEDIUM SHOT PHEW, MAGGIO, CHOATE Prew chalks his cue, hands trembling, turns to Maggio. 
PREW Thanks. 
MAGGIO I just hate to see a good man get it in the gut. 
CHOATE You might as well get use to it, kid. You probly be seein it often before you die. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND CHOATE In b.g. a few of the men are moving to and from the latrine but most of them are in their bunks. Over shot the sound of a bugle blowing Tattoo is heard. Lights are being extinguished in various parts of the room. Prew and Choate are lying on adjoining bunks, smoking. Choate's voice is almost linked to his last speech of preceding scene. 
CHO ATE ... oh, sure, we got a few bad non- coms and we got Dynamite Holmes for a Captain. But I been around twenty years in this Army. They even up. 
In b. g. Warden and SERGEANT PETE (POP) KARELSEN come through from the latrine. The latter is a grizzled, crumbled dog- face, about fifty. 
CHOATE Take A Compny. They got the best Compny Commander I ever saw. But their Topkick -- he ain't no Warden. 
Warden stops beside Prew and Karelsen moves on, going in to a small room off the main squadroom. Warden's big, powerful body is covered only by a towel around his loins. He smiles at Prew. 
WARDEN Hello, kid. Everythin nice and comfy? 
PREW Never better. 
WARDEN 'at's the lull before the storm, kid. Set yourself. 
He moves off, goes into the room he shares with Karelsen. 
PREW What's the deal with him, anyway? I can't figure him. 
The lights are almost all off and activity in the room has ended. 
CHOATE The Warden? He's a wild man. He was in the 15th when they seen their action in the Settlement in Shanghai. I heard about it down in the Philippes even. He got himself a DSC and a Purple Heart out of it but you'd never know it if I dint tell you. This next war comes, Warden'll be right in there, standin up on the skyline, trio to get himself killed, but nothing will ever touch him. He'll come through maddern, wildern, craziern ever. All I know is he's the best soljer I ever saw... 
The lights are all out now and the room is in darkness. 
FADE OUT. 
LONG SHOT FROM WARDEN'S POV as Karen drives by, turning her head slightly toward Warden. There is the vaguest trace of i smile. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT FEATURING WARDEN as he turns to watch the departing car. 
LEVA I'm tellin you, Top, she's trouble. You better keep your mind off what you're thinkin. 
CAMERA MOVES TO CLOSE SHOT of Warden, still looking after the car, thinking. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN AND HOLMES It is a gloomy, rainy day and the lights are on in the office. Warden is at his desk, working. Holmes is buckling on his trench coat. He wears a happy smile. 
HOLMES I won't be back in time to take Retreat. (winks at Warden) Or Reveille either, probably. 
WARDEN Yes, sir. 
HOLMES (strides back and forth; JOVIALLY) All work and no play, Sergeant. All you do is sit around sweating over this paper and that. There are other things in this world beside work. 
Warden carries some official papers to Holmes' desk. 
HOLMES (bending over, tying SHOELACE) (MORE) HOLMES(CONT'D) You ought to get out more yourself, Warden. 
Warden is looking directly at the picture of Karen on Holmes' desk. 
WARDEN I've been considering it. 
He turns aside as Holmes straightens up. 
HOLMES Well, I'm going. 
He claps Warden on the back fraternally. 
HOLMES I'm leaving it in your care, Sergeant. 
WARDEN It'll be here when you get back. 
Holmes goes out. Warden turns back to Holmes' desk. He is still holding the papers in one hand. He looks at Karen's picture, picks it up with his other hand, squints at it, considering the chances very, very carefully. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BACK PORCH OF HOLMES' HOUSE - DAY 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN standing on the open porch, in the rain. He wears a GI raincoat. He is squinting at the door with the same expression he used looking at Karen's picture. He takes a deep breath as if he were going off a high diving board, then knocks briskly. A shadow moves across the room behind the curtains. Then Karen opens the door. She is in shorts and a blouse. 
KAREN Oh. If it isn't Sergeant Warden. You better step inside or you'll get wet. 
Warden opens the screen door and jumps in past the water running off the eaves. 
INT. SMALL PANTRY OFF KITCHEN - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT as Warden jumps in. He takes off his rain hat. 
WARDEN I am wet. 
KAREN If you're looking for my husband, he isn't here. 
WARDEN (taking the long chance) And if I'm not looking for him? 
KAREN (UNSMILING) He still isn't here. If that does you any good. 
WARDEN (QUICKLY) Well, I'm looking for him. Do you know where he is? 
KAREN I haven't the slightest idea. Perhaps he's in town. I guess it was `in town' the way you put it, wasn't it? Or perhaps he's at the Club. Having a drink. 
WARDEN (fishes in his pocket, brings out papers) I got some papers it's important for him to sign. Today. 
KAREN (TURNS) I'll try phoning him at the Club for you. 
WARDEN I never like to disturb a man drinking. 
KAREN (TURNS BACK) What is it you want, Sergeant? 
WARDEN I could use a drink myself right now. Bad. Anyway, I got a faint suspicion the Captain's `in town.' Ain't you going to ask me in? 
Karen finally smiles, faintly. She goes into the kitchen, leaving the door open. Warden follows her. 
INT. KITCHEN HOLMES HOUSE - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT The kitchen is small and undistinguished. Karen takes a whisky bottle from a cabinet, pours a straight, stiff drink, puts it on the sink. Warden puts the papers down and drinks. Karen sits on a high kitchen stool. 
KAREN You're taking an awful chance, you know. My maid is liable to be home any time. 
WARDEN No she won't. Thursday's her day off. 
He takes off his raincoat, drops it on a chair. 
KAREN You think of everything, don't you, Sergeant? 
WARDEN I try. In my position you have to. 
KAREN (goes to sink, picks up THE PAPERS) Are these really important? 
WARDEN Yes. But not important they get signed today. Tomorrow's okay. 
CLOSE FLASH WILSON AND PREW Wilson bawling Prew out, thumbing him to one side of obstacle course. 
FLASHES PREW chinning himself on bar setup near obstacle course; he is near physical exhaustion. 
OBSTACLE COURSE PREW going through alone, on his belly in deep mud. 
CLOSEUP PREW (CULMINATION OF SUPERIMPOSED CLOSEUPS AND END OF MONTAGE) 
coming HEAD-ON into camera as he bellies through the mud of the obstacle course. Snatch of mingled voices of non-coms yelling "Keep it downs", "Get that nose in the mud!", etc. Prew is utterly spent. His face drops into the mud, which splatters up, obscuring the screen. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
CLOSE SHOT SWIRLING DISHWATER IN SINK 
MEDIUM SHOT PREW bent over the sink, scraping, washing and rinsing cooking pans and mixing basins. He hangs the soap bucket on the hot faucet and turns it on full force. As he does, PRIVATE WILLARD, a fat, whining cook, dumps an additional huge pile of pans before him. Prew looks at them ruefully. Willard says something to him with a "hustle up" gesture. The faucet drowns the words. 
MEDIUM SHOT ANOTHER PART OF KITCHEN PREW AT SINK IN B.G. Men are working in the steady, helpless motion of the KP. Waiters swing in and out of the entrances leading to the mess halls, carrying large trays. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT STARK The Mesa Sergeant, a tall, gaunt man, surveys the scene possessively. Maggio, Dining Room Orderly today, wearing a soiled white coat, flashes by to the mess hall, almost dropping his loaded tray in his haste. 
MEDIUM SHOT PRIVATE TREADWELL A slow, lazy, heavy man, peeling potatoes. There is a large kettle filled with dirty water in front of him in which the potatoes are floating. Treadwell stabs at one with a long fork, misses it. He stabs again, almost in slow motion, misses again. He sees Stark glowering over him. 
TREADWELL Ah+m suppose to be a automatic rifle man, not a spud-cutter. 
STARK (DISGUSTEDLY) Rifle man, huh? All somebody'd have to do would be holler war at you and it'd be over the hill and far away. 
Stark walks off. 
TREADWELL ... they just give me my chance they'll see... 
He is surprised and pleased as he spears a potato this time. He raises it triumphantly like a caught fish. 
MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND WILLARD The faucet is still on and we cannot hear what Willard says as he dumps more pans before Prew. However, he is obviously complaining that Prew is slow. Prew, sweating and angry, barks something back at him and turns the faucet off. 
PREW No cook ever used that many panel Not even for an officers, banquet, ladies invited! Want me to grow couple more arms?! 
Stark, always alert to trouble, comes into shot. Willard sees him and speaks with whining dignity, for Stark's benefit. 
WILLARD All I ask is that you keep the pans washed up so they're clean when I need them. In order that I am allowed to cook the kind of food required for men who work hard all day and who need good nourishing food to get their nourishment. 
STARK Hole up 'at noise. This man's hot as a forty-five shootin downhill. 
WILLARD (TERRIBLY INJURED) How you think I can do my job if the Mess Sergeant takes sides with a goldbricking KP? What do you think I am? 
STARK I think you're a fat cook who can't cook. 
As Willard retires, Maggio pours through from the mass hall. Screaming joyously, he shoves two empty platters in front of him. 
MAGGIO Comin through! Comin through! Me and my table waiters! (MORE) MAGGIO(CONT'D) We workin our tail off. They runnin us to death. Hot stuff! Comin through hot stuff one side! 
Nobody pays any attention but Prew, who smiles at him. Maggio winks back. 
MAGGIO Hello, Prew! Bettern being threwn in jail, ain't it? 
Maggio passes camera, leaving the shot and disclosing Warden, who has entered from the mess hall in his wake. He carries a dish of eggs and sausage and is leaning against a pastry table. He is grinning lovingly toward Prew. He strolls over to Prew. He eats through following. The smile never leaves his face, broadens as the scene progresses. 
WARDEN You look awful tard, kid. 
CLOSE SHOT PREW working over the sink. 
WARDEN'S VOICE How do you like straight duty?. Life in a rifle compny, eh? 
Prew stops working, turns toward Warden. 
PREW What makes you think I mind it? 
MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING KP'S, STARK, MAGGIO, WILLARD, TREADWELL as something electric transmits itself and they all stop what they are doing to look over toward Prew and Warden. 
WARDEN I didn't say you minded it, kid. I just said you looked tard. Drawn to a fine edge. 
PREW (SMILES BACK) I don't mind it, Top. It's a great life, this. I find a pearl, I'll cut you in. Fifty-fifty, If you hadn't put me here, I wouldn't have had no chance to find it. 
TWO SHOT WARDEN AND PREW 
WARDEN Well, well, there's a man for you. I'll see if I can fix you up with a lot more since you like it so much. How you like the garbage detail? 
PREW Thanks, Top, I've had it. You give it to me Tuesday. Remember? 
WARDEN (nods, as if just REMEMBERING) Well, then, how 'bout street cleaning detail? 
PREW That, too. Yesterday. 
WARDEN (NODS) You got a better memory than me. Guess the best thing to do is leave you right in the kitchen a while, huh? 
He pretends to turn away, then stops, turns back. 
WARDEN Course if you was an ath-a-leet you wouldn't have to pull KP. Or any fatigue duty for that matter... 
PREW (not smiling now) If you think you can push me into fightin, Warden, you're wrong. Not you and Dynamite and The Treatment. I'm twice the man you are. If you dint have them stripes I'd take you out on the green and beat you to a pulp. 
WARDEN (smile growing bigger) Don't let the stripes worry you, kid. I can always take my shirt off. Take it off right now. 
PREW You'd like that. You could get me a year in the Stockade for that one, couldn't you? 
INT. NEW CONGRESS CLUB - LARGE CLUB ROOM - NIGHT 
FULL SHOT Several rooms branch off from this main one. There are about a dozen soldiers in civilian clothes -- and about a dozen hostesses. Several couples are dancing. The man at the piano is banging away, his music clashing cacophonically with a jukebox record from an adjoining room. CAMERA PANS as Mrs. Kipfer moves to and fro encouraging the men to enjoy themselves. The New Congress is a sort of primitive U.S.O., a place of well-worn merriment. It is not a house of prostitution but the girls look available for goosing... all but one we see at the end of the PAN. She sits alone on a couch. This is LORENE. There is an innocent, child-like look about her. Her hair is done demurely in a circular roll low on her neck. She is about twenty-four. She is reading a 
magazine, untouched by the din around her. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT SERGEANT "FATSO" JUDSON pounding the piano as if he is trying to knock the keys out. He has an enormous head and a hogshead chest. He resembles Porky Pig. His dead eyes look like two beads of caviar spaced far apart on a great white plate. 
MEDIUM SHOT NEAR CURTAINS TO VESTIBULE Maggio is attempting some serious dancing with SANDRA, a very tall girl. Fatso's furious tempo and tune keep drowning the langorous tango coming from the jukebox. Maggio keeps switching his style as he tries to get out of the range of the piano but cannot. He is very annoyed. He and Sandra dance out of shot, as Prew and Annette enter from the vestibule. CAMERA PANS them to a trio of girls on a couch. 
ANNETTE ... Girls, here's some new poison. This is Billy and Jean and Nancy. 
The girls smile, ad-lib hellos. Prew is looking over the girls' heads at someone in rear of room out of shot. 
MEDIUM SHOT LORENE FROM PREW'S POV As if she senses someone is staring at her, she looks up from the magazine, smiles serenely across the room. 
MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING PREW AND ANNETTE as she reacts sourly to Prew's reaction to Lorene. He seems transfixed. 
ANNETTE Don't tell me the Princess is your style. 
Annette takes his arm, moves him toward two quite good- looking girls talking to a soldier. 
ANNETTE Meet Suzanne and Roxanne. 
The girls greet him heartily but Prew is looking back over his shoulder at Lorene. Annette plucks his sleeve with haughty disdain. 
ANNETTE Much as I adore your company, you must allow me to tear myself away. I see a few friends at the door. (SNAPS) Also I can see I will be of no use to you much. 
She walks off. The other girls resume talking to the soldier. Prew continues to gaze across the room. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT LORENE smiling back. Her head tilts up slowly as if someone is coming toward her. Prew comes into shot and stands before her, tongue-tied. She pats the couch. Her voice is low- pitched, poised. 
LORENE Would you like to sit down? 
PREW (SITTING) Oh... sure. 
LORENE I'm Lorene. 
PREW (enchanted by the name) Lorene... 
LORENE I haven't seen you in here before. 
Prew gestures with the membership card. 
PREW I dint know about this place till now. A friend of mine brought me. We're stationed at Schofield. 
LORENE Oh. Somehow I didn't think you were a soldier. 
PREW (bridles a bit) Well, I am. And I'm in for the whole ride. I'm a thirty-year man. 
LORENE I suppose it's different when a fellow is going to make a career of it. 
PREW There ain't anythin wrong with a soljer that ain't wrong with everyone else. 
Lorene smiles her fatal smile at Prew's seriousness. 
LORENE I like you just the same. I liked you the minute I saw Annette bringing you in. 
PREW (MELTS) Me, too. I mean when I came in. I saw you over here -- 
There is a commotion across the room. A group of man and girls are surrounding the piano. Fatso has stopped playing and a shouting argument is going on between him and Maggio. Prew looks over, concerned. 
FATSO'S VOICE I'll play loud as I want, ya little Wop! 
A babble of voices drowns out Maggio's reply. 
PREW Friend of mine. (RISES) You wait right here for me, will ya? 
LORENE (SMILES SWEETLY) Surely. 
MEDIUM SHOT AT PIANO where two men are holding Fatso and three girls are restraining Maggio. The others are amused by the quarrel, but Fatso and Maggio are deadly serious. 
MAGGIO Mess with me, Fatstuff, I'll pull you apart! 
FATSO You're the kind of character I eat for breakfast, ya little -- 
Maggio breaks away from the girls and rushes toward Patso but Prew, stepping through the group, grabs him. Mrs. Kipfer bustles into the melee. 
MRS. KIPFER Now, you gentlemen know I will not have any of this sort of thing. 
MAGGIO Shut up, you Wop, he says to me! 
FATSO Little Mussolini here tryin to tell me what way to play the piano. 
MAGGIO Yeah, my ear drums fit to bust already with that noise! 
MRS. KIPFER You man can simply leave if you're not going to behave yourselves. 
PREW Come on, Angelo, come on -- 
MAGGIO -- Ony my friends can call me Wop -- 
MEDIUM SHOT AT SIDE OF ROOM where Prew hauls Maggio away from the piano. 
SOLDIER (has been watching) You know who that guy is, buddy? 
WARDEN (OUTRAGE) Listen, what started all this, anyway? Why'm I shakin inside like a school kid out with teacher! Where'd I come up with a yen for of all things the Compny Commander's wife! And her actin like Lady Astor's horse all because I only got here on time! 
Warden's burst shatters the tension. Karen breaks into laughter. After a moment, Warden joins in. 
KAREN On the other hand, I've got a bathing suit under my dress. 
WARDEN Funny. I got one in a U-Drive-It parked around the corner. 
He takes her hand. They rise and walk away, backs to camera. They merge with the other couples in the little park. 
INT. LARGE CLUB ROOM - NEW CONGRESS - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT COUCH Fatso's piano music o.s. Prew is slumped on the couch. He stubs out the cigarette, which is almost burnt down. He sees someone coming toward him, slowly raises his eyes. Lorene comes into shot, looks down at him. 
PREW How's the surfboard rider? 
LORENE That was a terrible way to have acted. What you did. 
PREW I was jealous. 
LORENE (LAUGHS) You're a funny one. 
PREW What do you dames want? To take the heart out of a man and tie it up in barbed wire? 
LORENE (angry because she really LIKES PREW) Now, look here, what do you think Mrs. Kipfer pays us for? We're hired to be nice to all the boys. They're all alike. Is it so important? 
PREW (STANDS; URGENTLY) Yes, it's important. Maybe we seem all alike but none of us is ever all alike. (PAUSE) All right, I'm sorry about before. 
LORENE (touched by his outburst) That piano is about to drive me out of my mind. Let's go up to Mrs. Kipfer's suite and sit there. She lets us use it sometimes... for somebody special. 
PREW Are you mad? 
LORENE No, I'm not mad. 
PREW Because if you're still mad I'd just rather we called the whole thing off. 
LORENE (takes his arm) You certainly are a funny one. 
They walk away from camera, merging with the others in-the room. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. OCEAN AND BEACH - NIGHT 
FULL SHOT WAVE sweeping over camera, spray flying. 
MEDIUM SHOT ON BEACH A tiny beach set among rocks. The pale sand glows in the moonlight. Warden, in a bathing suit, is lighting a fire about ten yards from the water's edge. Karen is just stepping out of her dress; her bathing suit is underneath. A couple of GI blankets near the fire. Her teeth are beginning to chatter in the chill of the night air; she raises her arms to the sky longingly, happily. 
KAREN I hope the ocean's ice cold. I hope I freeze in a solid chunk. 
WARDEN (sudden, intense laugh) Just so long's you melt afterwards. 
KAREN I love the way you laugh. 
He stands, moves to her. She laughs, turns and runs into the water. He runs after her. 
FULL SHOT WAVE near shore, as Karen dives into it. Warden follows her. The wave washes over them. 
INT. NEW CONGRESS CLUB - MRS. KIPFER'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT DIVAN CAMERA ANGLED so we see only back of the divan. We hear soft chuckles from Prew and Lorene o.s., then silence for several moments. CAMERA MOVES as we hear a few more low, intimate laughs, then Prew and Lorene are disclosed on the couch, their heads close together as if they have just kissed pleasantly but not passionately. Mrs. Kipfer's living room is on the order of the vestibule; it, too, has a faded lavender feeling. A door leading to another room is half open in b.g. A door leading to a hall is closed. Prew's arm is around Lorene's shoulder; he is very relaxed, regards her with something like wonder. Lorene is mellower, too, making no effort now to be "the Princess." She speaks as if resuming a conversation. 
LORENE ... I enlisted, too. I came out here on my own. To get away from my home town. In Oregon. 
PREW How come? 
LORENE I had a boy friend. I was a waitress. He was from the richest family in town. He just married the girl suitable for his position. After three years of going around with me. (PAUSE) It's a pretty story, isn't it? Maybe they could make a movie of it. 
PREW They did. Ten thousand of them. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Lorene smiles. 
LORENE So I left and went to Seattle, as a waitress. And I met a girl just back from Hawaii. She said she'd made a lot of money working for Mrs. Kipfer. I caught the first boat. I've been here a year and two months. 
PREW You like it much? 
LORENE Oh, I don't like it. But I don't mind it. Anyway, I won't be here forever. 
PREW No. Sure not. I mean, why should you? 
LORENE I have it all figured out. In another year I'll be back home, with a pile of bills big enough to choke a steer. And then I will be all set for life -- 
There is a sound at the door and they turn towards it. 
MEDIUM SHOT DOOR TO HALL as it opens slowly and a disembodied arm pokes through, its hand gripping the neck of a whisky bottle. After a moment, Maggio's head follows the arm through the door. He is grinning like an amateur conspirator. 
MAGGIO I dint hear no sounds of combat. So I figgered maybe you'd like a drink. 
THREE SHOT as Maggio comes into the room. 
MAGGIO Or otherwise old Sandra would of drank it all by herself. She's a fine girl. But she drinks like a fish. 
There are glasses on a cupboard near the divan. Maggio sets three of them up, starts to pour whisky into them. 
LORENE No, thanks. I never drink much. 
KAREN I don't know. Maybe a lot. Or maybe you just think there's a lot. 
WARDEN Maybe I do. Maybe there's been a long line of beach parties -- 
KAREN You must be crazy -- ! 
WARDEN Am I? Listen, baby, maybe not here. But what about when you and Holmes were at Fort Bliss? 
Karen flings off the blankets, snatches her dress, stands up, raging. She speaks as she pulls the dress over her head, wriggles into it. 
KAREN I had to go and forget you were a man -- with the same rotten filthy mind the rest of them have. For a minute I had to convince myself you were different -- 
WARDEN Only it's true, ain't it? 
KAREN Yes, it's true! A part of it, some small part of whatever sewage you've been listening to. Some day perhaps you'll get all the story. 
WARDEN (YAPS UP) All what story? 
KAREN You're getting to sound so much like a typical male. So you just sweat it out like a typical male. 
She starts toward the rocks at the end of the beach, walking fast, then almost running. Warden runs after her. 
MEDIUM SHOT BEACH NEAR PATH UP ROCKS as Warden catches up with Karen. He grasps her arm roughly, hauls her down onto the sand. He stares at her bitterly, waiting f or her to speak. 
KAREN All right. I've never told it to anyone before. But I think now is the time. I'll tell you the whole bloody messy thing. You can take it back to the barracks with you. 
She speaks rapidly, pouring it out in bursts. For much of the story her face is in shadow, as if a cloud is passing across the moon. 
KAREN I'd been married to Captain Dana E. Holmes two years. Only he was a First Lieutenant then. Back at Fort Bliss. We lived right on a little lake where we could fish and swim and be alone, our 'dream cottage'... I'm sure you must be able to picture it. It was off on a back road, four miles from the highway. Two miles from a neighbor and a telephone.... (pauses, then rushes on) I hadn't been married long when I knew my husband was stepping out on me. But -- you get used to that. Your mother tells you that it's life, that i t happens to a lot of women. Of course, she doesn't tell you until after it happens. 
ANOTHER ANGLE FEATURING WARDEN reacting with fury toward Holmes, compassion for Karen. 
KAREN Then, by that time, you're pregnant. And at least you've something else to hope for. I think I was almost happy that night the pains began. Even though they were weeks too early, a whole month too early. I remember Dana was putting on that dapper silk gabardine uniform he used to wear. He was going to an officer's 'seminar.' He was kidding me about false labor. I didn't think it was humorous. I told him to get home early, to bring the doctor with him. He smiled tenderly and told me about the psychic reactions of women to pregnancy. But never fear, he'd be back early. And maybe he would have... if the 'seminar' hadn't been with the hat-check girl in one of the night clubs. 
WARDEN Listen. 
TWO SHOT 
KAREN He was only a little drunk when he came in... at five a.m. He looked alarmed when he saw me. I guess it was because of my screams. I was lying there on the floor, you see -- No, don't say anything. I'm not finished yet. Of course, the baby was dead. It was a boy. But they worked over me at the hospital and fixed me up fine. They even took my appendix out, too. They threw that in free. It was all fine. 
WARDEN Listen. Listen. Please. 
KAREN And, of course, one more thing no more children. Do you know what that means? You're not a woman. You're not anything. You're a gutted shell... Sure, I went out with some of the men after that. A few months of it. I'd been made dirty and I wanted to be clean. You can see that, can't you?... Anyway, I got my revenge on Dana. I kept on living with him. 
WARDEN The hateful, miserable -- 
KAREN You hunt so hungrily for love... love, if you can find it, you think, might give things meaning again. 
WARDEN Listens Listen to me -- 
KAREN All right. I'm listening. 
Warden shakes his head, inarticulate with his rage and love. Karen moves closer to him. 
KAREN I know. Until I met you I didn't think it was possible, either. 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
INT. DAYROOM - NIGHT 
PAN SHOT AROUND ROOM Over shot soft strumming guitars and two voices singing a quiet blues. There are scattered groups,about fifteen men in all -- playing pool, ping-pong, reading, writing letters, talking. CAMERA REACHES PRIVATE SAL ANDERSON and Friday Clark, playing the guitars and singing. Clark plays only passably, but Anderson is highly accomplished, effortlessly sounding off chord progressions in diminished minors. Friday, the bugler, is about twenty-four, with shy, trusting eyes. Anderson is the same age, also quiet, non-aggressive. CAMERA CONTINUES PANNING, PASSES a soldier reading a newspaper who shakes his head and mutters, "... ain't it terrible about Lou Gehrig dyin...", then MOVES IN to HOLD on a group at a window seat, bulling. Prew is stretched out wearily, looks as if he's been through another recent dose of The Treatment. Maggio perches in the frame of the window like an aggressive robin. Treadwell slouches at the end of the seat. Pete Karelsen is in a chair nearby, reading a magazine. 
TREADWELL ... Ah'm in the Army because Ah can live better on the Inside than on the Outside. 
PREW It ain't the reason I'm in. 
MAGGIO Now he's gonna give us that snow about bein a Thirty-Year Man again. 
PREW That's right. Look at Karelsen there. Only seven years more for rockin chair money. 
Karelsen hears his name, looks over. 
MEDIUM SHOT KARELSEN CAMERA AT ANGLE so we see he's reading a full-page advertisement featuring a girl in a revealing negligee. He is feeling sorry for him;elf. 
KARELSEN The Profession wears you down, though, young man. Down thin like a knife what's been honed and honed. All that good steel just rubbed away... 
He turns back sadly to study the figure of the girl. 
MEDIUM SHOT FEATURING ANDERSON AND CLARK OTHERS IN B.G. Anderson peels off a flourish as he and Clark end their song. 
TREADWELL Man, that's blues! Where'd you drag that one up Prom? 
ANDERSON (BASHFULLY) Oh, just stumbled on it. 
He strums aimlessly again. Prew and Treadwell come over to listen, prop themselves on chairs. During following, several others stroll over and a soldier writing at a desk nearby stops, turns to listen. 
CLOSE SHOT PREW warmed by the friendliness of the music and the moment. 
PREW They got Truckdrivers' Blues... Sharecroppers' Blues... Bricklayers' Blues... We oughta have a Soljers' Blues... 
MEDIUM SHOT GROUP as Anderson repeats a theme he has happened on. It has a haunting melody. 
CLARK Hey, look... I betcha we could make one out of what you just played. Do that again. 
Fatso drops the knife. It clatters on the floor. There is another audible whoosh of breath from the room. 
WARDEN Almost scared there wasn't anybody going to stop you for a minute, weren't you? (finally lowers his voice) Is there any other little things you punks'd like me to take care of for you? 
He drops the beer bottles on a nearby table, strides to his own table. The room settles back, still hushed. Warden has broken the mood of certain death, but Fatso, still facing Maggio, bites off his words with sadistic, ominous venom. 
FATSO Tough monkey. Hard sister. Guys like you get to the Stockade sooner later. One day you walk in there I'll be waitin. I'll show you a coupla things. 
He walks away, drops into a stool at the counter. 
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN'S TABLE Warden stands beside the table, watching. He seems satisfied as Fatso moves away from Maggio. Still standing, he raises his half-filled bottle of beer, drinks. 
MEDIUM SHOT PREW'S TABLE Maggio drops onto the stool, sidles it over to the table. He half-whispers to Prew. 
MAGGIO I made a mistake I guess, but I don't see how I could of done anything else, after that big stoop said a thing like that. 
Prew leans over and picks the knife off the floor. 
PHEW I'll tell you your mistake. You didn't hit him hard enough to put him out. 
MAGGIO I hit him hard as I could. His head must be solid ivory. 
In b.g. Warden puts down the beer bottle and stalks towards the door. Maggio and Prew turn to watch him pass. 
MAGGIO Anyway, I'm glad he stopped it. He's a good man, you know it? 
As if on impulse, Prew rises and follows Warden out. 
EXT. CHOY'S - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT as Prew carves out. Choy's is on a wide road across from the entrance to the Post. Prew looks around for Warden, sees him off to one side. CAMERA MOVES WITH Prew as he goes over to him. 
CLOSE SHOT WARDEN leaning against the building, undergoing a delayed reaction to the fierce moment in Choy's. He is white-faced, sweating heavily. He looks as if he's going to be sick. 
CLOSE SHOT PREW astonished yet appreciative that under Warden's confidence and control in Choy's there has been a human frailty. 
PREW ... That was a near thing. 
WARDEN ... Yeah. 
Prew holds out Fatso's knife. Warden is beginning to get control of himself; he manages a weak smile. 
WARDEN You keep it, kid. Keep it for a souvenir. 
Prew puts the knife in his pocket. They stare at one another a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express some deep emotion of respect. 
WARDEN You ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid? 
PREW (THIN SMILE) They can kill you but they can't eat you, Top. 
Warden studies Prew thoughtfully. Prew turns to go back into Choy's. 
WARDEN Prewitt. 
Prew stops, turns back. 
WARDEN Could you stand a weekend pass? 
Prew stares at him for a second, incredulously, unable to find his voice. 
PREW I thought -- 
WARDEN You thought what, kid? 
PREW How about Dynamite? 
WARDEN Leave Dynamite to me. He signs most anything I put in front of him `thout readies it. 
Though Prew is overjoyed he is somehow unable to say "thanks"; Warden grins broadly at him. 
WARDEN I hear you gone dippy over some dame you met at the New Congress Club. 
He slaps Prew on the shoulder roughly. 
WARDEN What'd you say her name was? 
FREW Lorene... 
WARDEN Pretty name. 
Warden walks off across the street. Prew stares after him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WAIKIKI BEACH - DAY 
CLOSE SHOT PREW AND LORENE Lorene is covering Prew with sand and has him almost completely buried. Only his face remains uncovered. He is griming up at her. She seems thoughtful. 
PREW ... Lorene... 
She throws a towel over his face. He chuckles under it. 
LORENE My name's Alma. 
The chuckle from under the towel dies. 
PREW (NODS) He's such a comical little guy and yet somehow he makes me always want to cry while I'm laughin at him. 
MEDIUM SHOT AT BAR FEATURING MAGGIO finishing a long gulp of beer. He puts glass down on the bar, hard. 
MAGGIO The Royal Hawaiian's jist around the corner. That's where them movie stars stay. Rita Hayworth and Joan Blondell and Maureen O'Hara... You look like a movie star, Lorene... yes, you do... How long 'fore we get in the war, Prew? 
PREW I don't know. Maybe we won't get in. 
MAGGIO Tha's what you say. 
He jumps off the bar stool suddenly, tears off his tie. 
MAGGIO Hot in here. 
He throws tie on the bar, The Bartender starts to protest. 
MAGGIO Swimming It's a great night for swimmin. (MORE) MAGGIO(CONT'D) (kicks off shoes) Goin swimmin with a movie star... 
He is unbuttoning his shirt as he abruptly dashes away, People around are laughing at him again. 
MEDIUM SHOT ALMA AND PREW as Prew watches Maggio rush out. He sees something else o.s, which worries him. 
LONG SHOT FROM PREW'S POV The two MPs cross toward direction Maggio has taken. They are obviously going after him. 
MEDIUM SHOT ALMA AND PREW Alma follows Prew's troubled look. 
ALMA You better go look out for him, 
Prew glances at her gratefully, then slips off his stool. He picks up Maggio's tie and shoes and hurries out after him. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. ROYAL HAWAIIAN GROUNDS - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT Tall pale royal palms contrast with thick dark plants and bushes. An ornamental lamppost alongside a walking path a little distance away. Prew comes into shot cautiously, carrying Maggio's tie and shoes. He moves quickly, bends over. CAMERA PANS AND MOVES IN and we see it is Maggio's shirt and trousers which Prew has discovered on the ground. He looks at them wryly, picks them up, moves on. 
ANGLE PREW IN F.G. AND LAMPPOST WITH BENCH NEAR IT IN B.G. Prew, carrying Maggio's clothes, stops as he sees what looks like a shadow lying across the bench. 
PREW (CALLS SOFTLY) Is that you, Angelo? 
The shadow does not move. Prew approaches the bench. 
MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND PREW Maggio is stretched out on the bench, seems to be sleeping blissfully. He is clothed only in his shorts. Despite himself, Prew smiles. He shakes the reclining figure. 
PREW Maggio, you nut. Get up. Wake up. 
Maggio mumbles without opening his eyes or moving. 
MAGGIO I'm sorry, sir. I won't do it again. Just don't lock me up, sir. Honest, I won't. 
PREW Here's your clothes. 
He throws the clothes on Maggio. 
MAGGIO (opens his eyes) Well, give 'em back to the Indians. The Indians need clothes. All they wear is G strings. 
PREW Boy, are you drunk! 
MAGGIO ... maybe a movie star comes outs the hotel right now and picks us up and takes us back to the States in her private plane... and installs us in her private swimming pool -- 
Prew pulls Maggio off the bench and starts to drag him across the path away from the light. 
MAGGIO (YELLS) Take it easy, Prew. You scrapin my tail on the sandy sidewalk. 
PREW You'll get worse than that scraped - - Listen! 
The ominous sound of leggins brushing each other is heard, not far away. Prew looks off. 
LONG SHOT THROUGH BUSHES The two MPs are on the street just outside the grounds. They are still looking for Maggio, somewhat aimlessly now. 
MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND PREW Prew whispers to Maggio as he pulls him to his feet. 
PREW Come on before you're in trouble -- 
Maggio pushes him away. 
MAGGIO Stop it! 
PREW Shut up! 
MAGGIO I'm sick of its Can't a man get drunk? Can't a man do nothin? Can't a man put his lousy hands in his lousy pockets on a lousy street? A man gotta be hounded every minute of his life? I ain't gain to take its I ain't no cowards I ain't yellows I ain't no bums I ain't no scum! MPs! MPs! COME AND GET US! HERE WE IS! 
PREW (AGHAST) Now you done it. 
MEDIUM SHOT END OF PATH NEAR STREET The two MPs came running onto the path, spot Maggio and Prew about thirty yards away. 
MEDIUM SHOT PEW AND MAGGIO Maggio picks up his shoes, suddenly whips away from Prew and runs toward the MPs. 
ANOTHER ANGLE NEAR MPs as they stop, surprised. Maggio is shouting, "Can't a man do nothin?!" as he hurls first one shoe, then the other, directly at the MPs. One MP is hit in the shoulder, staggers back. Maggio dashes between him and the second MP, but the latter reaches out and grabs him. Maggio wrenches loose but instead of running, suddenly wades in, arms swinging wildly. In a moment, he is hanging crab-like on the man's back. The first MP charges Maggio. Maggio grabs the second MP's club and hits the first MP over the head. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW Horrified, he starts toward the fracas. 
MEDIUM SHOT MAGGIO AND MPs IN F.G. PREW IN B.G. The second MP has managed to get out from under Maggio. He smashes his fist into Maggio's face as the latter continues to wield the club. Maggio sees Prew coming toward them. 
MAGGIO Get back! I'm handlin this! Take off! 
SHOT as the Reconnaissance car drives through the chain-mesh gate. In the distance is the Stockade, a building that looks something like a country schoolhouse. Music sweeps up as the gate clangs shut.

INT. OFFICE OF SERGEANT OF THE GUARD - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT CAMERA SHOOTS from behind a man seated at a desk. Prominent in shot is a wicked-looking chopped-off hoe handle lying on the desk. Maggio enters, recognizes the man. He walks, up to the desk, his face set in defiance. Music is rising in a fearful crescendo. CAMERA PANS just enough to REVEAL desk sign reading: "SERGEANT OF THE GUARD." The man stands up and the music stops abruptly.

CLOSE SHOT FLASH LANG-BLADED CARVING KNIFE SLICING ROAST BEEF 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT STEAM RISING FROM BETWEEN HOT STONES OF FIRE 
FULL SHOT LUAU Shot covers the continuation of all the above activity. This is a native luau - definitely not for tourists. Shot includes long ditches, heated by red-hot stones and lined with layers of banana leaves, containing pig, chicken, rock crabs, fish... Pots of native stew... Bowls of exotic fruit... Peels of raw cane... Working over the food are the natives, many of the men stripped to the waist, the women arrayed in colorful Hawaiian costumes. 
LONG SHOT THROUGH BONFIRE HULA DANCERS A group of male dancers swaying with the insistent beat of a group of old Hawaiian instruments. This is far removed from the night club Hula. This is a thing of swift, agile angularity, primitive and powerful. 
PAN SHOT SPECTATORS THROUGH BONFIRE At end of PAN, CAMERA REVEALS Warden and Karen in the group. They are the only whites in the group. 
CLOSE SHOT KAREN her face lit by the flames. She watches the dancing breathlessly. 
FLASHES TINY TOM TOM NOSE FLUTE GROUP OF MUSICIANS The native instruments playing a thin, weird melody. 
MEDIUM SHOT HULA DANCERS The men laugh and grin as they dance, taunt and tease somebody o.s. 
MEDIUM SHOT SPECTATORS They shout and laugh and squeal with delight as they watch. It is Warden the dancers are teasing. Several of the dancers break out of the group, dance over to Warden, continue to prod him, apparently urging him to join them. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT WARDEN protesting, joining in the laughter. Suddenly he kicks off his shoes, rolls his slacks up to his knees. He snatches a gardenia from the hair of a pretty Hawaiian girl next to him, sticks it over his ear, jumps into the firelight and dances with the others. The music comes up louder and faster as the spectators and dancers roar. 
GROUP SHOT DANCERS AND WARDEN They are all laughing as they dance, but as Warden moves with them it is apparent he is as good as any of them. 
MEDIUM SHOT SPECTATORS nodding, pointing at Warden, their hilarious laughter fading to delighted smiles. 
CLOSE SHOT KAREN astonished and thrilled at Warden's ability. 
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN His laughter now also diminished to a happy grin as he dances. In all he dances about thirty seconds. Then he breaks out of the group and runs over to Karen. 
GROUP SHOT FEATURING KAREN AND WARDEN as the spectators and dancers shout their applause. Warden comes up to Karen and puts the gardenia in her hair. Karen is glowing, tingling. 
KAREN You just love to shock people, don't you?! Where on earth did you learn to dance like that? 
WARDEN (PANTING HAPPILY) Believe it or not -- Chicago, Illinois. 
She flings her arms around him passionately. The onlookers howl with approval and merriment. Between Karen and Warden and camera, an enormously fat Hawaiian woman pours water on the stones in one of the trench-ovens. A cloud of steam rises, hiding them. 
EXT. CLIFF ROAD - DAY (TWILIGHT) 
LANG SHOT VALLEY SHOOTING DOWN a thousand feet into Palolo Valley. Bonfires and smoke rising from the floor of the valley. 
The thinnest carry of the ancient Hawaiian music. CAMERA PANS from precipice and INCLUDES Prew and Alma as they trudge into shot, climbing up the steep cliff road. 
TRACKING SHOT PREW AND ALMA holding hands as they walk. 
PREW -- If I dint get to see you once in a while The Treatment would've cracked me long ago. 
Alma, fairly winded from the climb, smiles but doesn't answer.

ALMA It's just around the bend. 
CAMERA HOLDS as they walk on around a bend in the road. 
EXT. ALMA'S HOUSE 
MEDIUM SHOT The small house is perched precariously on the very edge of the cliff. Alma and Prew come around the bend, come up to the door, Prew marvelling at the house. 
KAREN I don't know what's happened to you -- you were honest at first -- 
WARDEN At first! You were tough and solid as a rock -- and now you're a whining crybaby -- 
He stops abruptly. 
KAREN And so they were married and lived unhappily ever after. 
They are silent for several moments. 
WARDEN I've never been so miserable in my life as I have since I met you. 
KAREN Neither have I. 
WARDEN (CHEERLESSLY) I wouldn't trade a minute of it. 
KAREN (CHEERLESSLY) Neither would I. 
Warden rises and paces again. Suddenly he stops, turns, looks down at Karen, speaks in the same gloomy tone. 
WARDEN I'll probably make the lousiest officer they ever saw in this Army. 
A happy smile creeps over Karen's face. Despite himself, he begins to smile also. 
KAREN (FERVENTLY) You'll make a fine officer. A remarkable officer. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. PORCH OF ALMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT The porch is at the rear of the house, leading off from the living room. It is on the very edge of the cliff. Prew and Alma are dancing to the music of a portable victrola. It is playing "Why Don't We Do This More Often?" A table still contains the dinner plates. Prew's expression holds the wonder of a child at a magic show. He misses a step, stumbles. 
PREW I never caught on to dancing much. 
ALMA You're a very good dancer. 
The record ends and Alma goes to change it. CAMERA FOLLOWS Prew to the edge of the porch as he looks out over the view. 
LONG SHOT VIEW PROM PREW'S POV A magnificent panorama -- strings of lights in the valley and across on St. Louis Heights -- in the far distance the neon of Waikiki.

PREW I been wanting to tell you a long time now -- (DEEP BREATH) I love you. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ALMA looking through records for a new choice. She speaks quite conversationally, as if offered a pleasant compliment. 
ALMA That's nice. Because I love you, too.

TWO SHOT as Alma comes over to Prew. 
PREW I mean it. I need you. 
ALMA (AS BEFORE) I'm glad. Because I need you, too. 
PREW (RECKLESSLY) A thirty-year man is movin all over, goin all the time. Up to now I never thought a thirty-year man had any business to think of gettin married. 
She stares at him, amazed, a touch angry. 
ALMA You're a funny one, little Prew boy. 
PREW (HURT) Yeah. Must be the altitude. 
ALMA A very funny one that I cannot figure out. 
PREW Why's it funny if a guy wants to marry you? 
ALMA Because I'm a girl you met at the New Congress Club! And that's about two steps up from the pavement. 
PREW Okay -- I'm a private no class dogface soljer. And the way most civilians look at it, that's two steps up from no thin. 
There is a silence. Alma is honestly distraught. 
ALMA Oh, Prew, Prew, I thought we were happy: Why do you want to spoil things? 
PREW Lissen, I ain't think in of now. But I got a plan cookin in my head. You want to go back to the States in a year. Well, you could stretch it some, make it two years. And I could swing a Sergeant's stripes -- If I were a non-com the Army'd let me pick my duty when I re-enlist. (lost in the picture of IT) And there's some posts back in the States -- like Jefferson Barracks -- The married noncoms rate solid brick houses... with lawns with new- cut grass and walks with big old oak trees... 
ALMA Now I know you've lost your mind! How do you expect to become a Sergeant under this Captain Holmes of yours? It's all you can do to keep out of the Stockade! 
CLOSE SHOT PREW 
PREW I could fight. 
TWO SHOT 
PREW It I go out for boxin he'd send me to non-com school. The Regimental Championship is next month. I bet I could win the middleweight even without training. I used to be pretty good I could do it. 
Alma is deeply moved. She speaks gravely, sincerely, not at all immodestly. 
ALMA No. I don't think you should give in to The Treatment... even to marry me. 
PREW This'd be worth it. 
ALMA (ALMOST DESPERATELY) Prew -- it's true we love each other now. But back in America, it might be different... We might not even want each other... 
She goes out to pantry. We hear the sound of the door to rear porch opening and closing. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT HOLMES wretched, completely at a loss. He stares into space, then looks down at his food, picks up a fork and ruefully begins to eat. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BARRACKS - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT LAWN 
Prew, on hands and knees, is on a weeding detail with three other men, one of them Sal Anderson. Another is PRIVATE NAIR, a tousle-headed, sentimental man we have not seen before. Sergeant Thornhill, in charge of the detail, lolls on the ground, his head propped against a tree, reading a comic book. Prew works his way over to Nair. 
PREW You just get out of the Stockade? 
NAIR (NODS) It was rugged, sam. But I kept my mouth shut and watched my step and I wasn't in no trouble. 
PREW You see Maggio? 
Nair nods, tells his tale in half-humorous, half-reverent fashion. 
NAIR Fatso's workin him over with a hoe handle. Places where it won't show mostly. You know, the back and the chest. The kidneys. Once in a while in the face. Know what Maggio does when that happens? Spits in Fatso's eye. (CHUCKLES) Oh, he's a hot one. Ain't he a hot one? 
PREW He's a good boy. 
NAIR Course, he throws up a little blood now and then. And he passes out a lot. But Fatso sure ain't reportin none of that. So there's no way they goin to find out. 
PREW Why don't he go to the C.O.? 
NAIR We tried to get him to. But he won't peep. He says he got a lot more scalp to lose first. That boy is about the hardest artery in the hospital. (with great sentiment) But he's got a heart just like a great big baby. 
Prew's face has been growing in fury. He pulls up a clump of sod, throws it down with all his might. 
PREW You think he's gonna be all right? 
NAIR Your guess is worth mine, sam. Maybe he's crackin a little at that -- cause after Fatso put him in the Hole -- that's what they call solitary -- a couple times he began talkin about how he's gonna e- scape. He said to tell you he'll look you up one of these nights. 
A shadow falls across the grass in front of Prew. 
SHOT GALOVITCH FROM PREW'S POV CAMERA SHOOTING UP from near the ground, the ANGLE EXAGGERATING Galavitch's ungainly, ape-like figure. He looks down at Prew, full of venom. 
GALOVITCH Still on knees, eh, Prewitt? Well, boxing finals next month. December f if teen. You s till got time help us make champions. 
MEDIUM SHOT PREW FROM GALOVITCHE'S POV 
Prew is at the breaking point. Controlling himself, he weeds around Galovitch's shadow. It moves in front of Prew again. 
GALOVITCH'S VOICE Are proud dis Compny to be or not? Bites de hand dat feeds it der shoot dogs for. Infortunately, ony dogs day are allowed to shoot, not men. 
MEDIUM SHOT GROUP The other men have stopped weeding, are looking over at Prew and Galovitch. Thornhill, in b.g., puts down the comic book and comes over to them during following. 
PREW Get outa my way, Ike. I ain't gonna move around you again. 
GALOVITCH You need better lesson than up to now. Maybe I give to you myself. Maybe right now. 
He steps on Prew's hand. As Prew jerks away from the heavy shoe Galovitch hauls him up by his fatigue shirt. Thornhill steps between them. 
THORNHILL (TO GALOVITCH) Ey, leave him alone. `e's in my DETAIL -- 
Prew shoves Thornhill aside, cold decision in his eyes. He starts unbuttoning his shirt. 
PREW (TO GALOVITCH) All right. It's gonna be your way. 
Galovitch rips off his shirt, bursting some of the buttons as he does. Stripped to the waist, his whole appearance seems to change; he looks as he did in the ring, a hard-muscled prize fighter. 
THORNHILL Ey, wait a minute, you guys -- ! 
Prew is barely able to get out of his shirt before Galovitch charges him. 
VARIOUS ANGLES PREW AND GALOVITCH AND SPECTATORS During following men run from across the quadrangle and from out of the barracks to watch the affair, form a circle around 
the fighters. Prew is a skillful boxer, moving around Galovitch quickly and cleverly. Galovitch is more lumbering but not awkward. His heavy blows stagger Prew several times. Prew drives his attack at his opponent's body. He never throws a punch at the other's head. 
NAIR The head, Prew! Hit him in the head! 
The other men around shout similar advice. 
CLOSE SHOT GALOVITCH puzzled by Prew's concentration on his body and by the shouts of the men. He seems to be wondering if Prew is pulling a trick. 
CLOSE SHOT PREW A fear, not born of cowardice, is reflected on Prew's face as he sets himself, stares at Galovitch. He seems haunted by the memory of Dixie Wells. 
CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES 
CLOSEUP PREW flinching without being hit. He seems mesmerized by the other's eyes. 
CLOSEUP GALOVITCH'S EYES 
MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH fighting. Galovitch draws blood from a cut over Prew's eye. He is getting the better of the battle. In b.g. Thornhill breaks out of the crowd and runs across the quadrangle. 
MEDIUM SHOT BALDY DHOM AND SPECTATOR 
SPECTATOR I don't get it -- Why don't Prew go for the head? 
DHOM He blinded a guy once. Must be scairt of the same thing. 
MEDIUM SHOT PREW AND GALOVITCH as Galovitch batters Prew back against the crowd. A right to the temple sends him to his knees. He shakes his head a moment, gets up and goes into a clinch. 
Thornhill steps into the circle, nods toward Anderson. 
THORNHILL `e's right, sir. (points to Galovitch) `e begun it. Prewitt done nothin. 
From the crowd step Sergeants Dhom, Wilson and Henderson. They face Holmes and Galovitch implacably. 
HENDERSON No, sir, this wasn't Prewitt's fault. 
DHOM That's right, sir. Everybody knows Galovitch started it. 
Wilson nods. There is a murmur of agreement from the crowd. Holmes looks at his fighters, rocked by this betrayal. They stare back at him. 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT COLONEL WILLIAMS Still near the rear of the crowd, he watches the scene with much interest. 
MEDIUM SHOT Holmes pulls himself together, turns to the crowd. 
HOLMES That's all. Break it off. Let's get back to our jobs. (to Prew and Galovitch; WEAKLY) I'm giving you two a break. I'll ignore this. 
He walks off. He does not see Colonel Williams. Galovitch moves off toward the barracks. Wilson, Henderson and Thornhill remain grouped around Prew. 
PREW You guys figure this means I'm steppin into a ring, you're wrong. 
EMERSON It's your show, kid. Run it the way you want. 
WILSON You better put same iodine on them cuts. 
DHOM Yeah. An come over to Choy's tonight. We buy you a beer. 
The non-coms walk off, Prew stares after them.

EXT. CHOY'S - NIGHT 
LONG SHOT ACROSS ROAD PREW CLARK ANDERSON Sounds of gaiety from the beerhouse mingle with the mournful twang of guitars being played by Clark and Anderson. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY toward the trio until the beerhouse noises are 
low. The men are surrounded by many empty beer bottles. 
PREW, CLARK AND ANDERSON (SINGING SOFTLY) Woke up sick on Thursday Feelin like my head took a dare Looked down at my trousers All my pockets was bare That girl sure was bad news Re-enlistment Blues... 
The guitars finish the stanza with a flourish as CAMERA HOLDS on MEDIUM SHOT. The men chuckle. 
CLARK Some day I'm goin back to Scranton and play it for my folks. And tell em it wan composed in the Hawaiian Islands! Clear across the Pacific Ocean! 
PREW (finishes long swig of BEER) Hey, Friday. 
CLARK Yeah? 
PREW Why you called Friday? 
CLARK Don't know. I was borned on Wednesday. (plucks guitar, sings) Went back around on Friday Asked for a free glass of beer... 
The three laugh, sing in unison. 
PREW, CLARK AND ANDERSON My friends had disappeared Barman said, `Take off, no credit here'... 
MEDIUM SHOT NEAR ENTRANCE TO CHOY'S The music from across the road almost lost in the laughter and shouts from the beerhouse. Warden comes out, wobbles a bit. He has One On. He cups his hand over his ear, straining to hear the singing. He stumbles into Choate, coming along the sidewalk. 
CHOATE Top, you sure plastered. 
WARDEN (MUSTERING DIGNITY) I am off duty. Off duty if I want to get plastered -- 
But Choate has gone into Choy's. CAMERA RETREATS with Warden as he wanders to the road, still trying to locate the singing. Half-way across the road he unceremoniously sits down, crosses his knees Buddha-wise. Here the singing is more audible. He listens contentedly. 
MEDIUM SHOT PREW ANDERSON CLARK 
PREW, ANDERSON AND CLARK (SINGING) Ain't no time to lose Re-enlistment Blues... 
Anderson, as usual, finishes the stanza with a brilliant display on the guitar. Prew stands up. In the glow of a streetlight his face shows the marks of his battle with Galovitch. He wobbles and we realize he, too, really Has One On. 
ANDERSON Where you go in? 
PREW Back to Choy's. Get nother drink. 
The guitars and singing continues in b.g. through following. CAMERA PANS with Prew as he weaves to the road. 
MEDIUM SHOT MIDDLE OF ROAD as Prew crosses. He can see the seated figure but the light from the street is too dim to identify it. 
WARDEN'S VOICE (BOOMS) Halt! 
Prew stops automatically. 
WARDEN'S VOICE Who goes there? 
PREW A friend. 
WARDEN'S VOICE Advance, friend, and be reconized. 
Prew moves closer, CAMERA WITH him, until he recognizes Warden. 
WARDEN (roaring, laughing) Quiet! At ease! Fall out! Right dress! `bout face! Hit the track! Garbage Detail! Latrine Detail! Dis a drill, not picnic! Hello, kid. Whatever you doin out all by yourself? 
PREW I'm goin to get a drink. 
WARDEN Siddown. I got a bottle.

Under a tarp inna back of a truck from the Motor Pool they rode me right out just like I figgered like I said... Ony the tailgate came down 'bout a mile back... an I fell inns road... (GIGGLES) ... shoulda seen me bounce... musta broke somethin... (clutches Prew's shirt) Prew... lissen... 
PREW Angelo... 
Warden steps back as Prew holds Maggio. During following Anderson and Clark come over, watch pop-eyed. 
MAGGIO Fatso... Fatso done it to me... yestiday he did it for keeps... He likes to whack me in the gut with a hoe handle an then he asks `that hurt?' and then I spit at him... Ony yestiday he done it ten times runnin an somethin bust... you know, like they was a fish swiminin aroun inside you... 
PREW (TO OTHERS) Come on, let's get him to the hospital. 
Maggio grasps him tighter. He is crying now. 
MAGGIO Prew... they gonna send you to the Stockade...? 
PREW No, Angelo -- 
TWO SHOT MAGGIO AND PREW 
MAGGIO (PLEADING) Should they do, watch out for Fatso! You gotta make like it's a game... He'll try to crack you but you ain't gonna crack... He's gonna see you but he'll never see you saw... `n' when he puts you in the Hole you just lay there `n' be still... `at's the ony way -- be still... `n' remember things... but not people. Not people! Things like nature... woods you been in... trees is awys good... 
He goes limp in Prew's arms, slides to the road. 
GROUP SHOT Warden bends over Maggio. The others watch, scared. 
CLOSE SHOT PREW staring down at Maggio. 
GROUP SHOT Warden looks up. 
WARDEN He's dead. 
CLARK Dead? But he was here just a minute ago. 
Prew bends over, picks up Maggio, holds him in his arms gently, unbelieving. 
STARK Fatso's lucky. They'll figure he got killed fallin out of that truck. 
PREW He ain't dead. 
CAMERA MOVES AHEAD of Prew as he carries Maggio to the jeep, the others following. He lifts Maggio into the rear of,the jeep. Warden puts his hand on Prew's arm. 
WARDEN He's dead, Prew. 
Prew stares at Maggio, lying in the jeep. Stark gets into the front of the jeep. 
STARK I'll take him, Prew. 
He starts the motor. Prew leans over, moves Maggio's body a little. 
PREW (TO STARK) See his head don't bump. 
The jeep drives off. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BARRACKS AREA - NIGHT 
LONG SHOT Framed beautifully in the moonlight, the Quadrangle and Barracks area look like a college campus. Silence. No movement. 
LONG SHOT ANOTHER ANGLE A figure can be seen far in b.g, at the Bugler's post beside the megaphone. Another figure stands near him. The silence continues, then is broken by the sound of the bugle beginning 
Taps. The first note is incredibly clear and loud and certain. It is held longer than most Buglers hold it. The second note is daringly short, abrupt. The last note of the first phrase rises, peals out, heartfelt. Two men come into the shot, smoking. They stop, turn toward the Bugler, listen attentively. One of them flips away his cigarette. The Taps continues through the following. 
INT. SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT 
FULL SHOT Most of the men turn in their beds toward the sound of the bugle. Some prop up on their elbows. 
CLOSE SHOT CHOATE as he listens. A look of mingled longing and satisfaction. 
CLOSE SHOT LEVA listening. A strange look of pride. 
CLOSE SHOT MAZZIOLI listening, his face also betraying emotions normally concealed. 
MEDIUM SHOT TREADWELL AND ANDERSON listening. Their bunks are next to each other. 
TREADWELL (a reverent whisper) I bet you it's Prewitt... 
EXT. PORCH ON BARRACKS - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT Three men come out of the barracks, lean over the porch rail, listening. Their faces are thoughtful, sad. 
INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT WARDEN The office lit only by a light over his desk. He is working late, a sheaf of papers spread out before him. He listens to the bugle call, moved, sorrowful. He snaps off the light, listens in the darkness. 
EXT. QUADRANGLE - NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT PREW at the Bugler's post. He is finishing the last phrases, full and wonderful. Behind him stands Friday Clark, motionless. The final note quivers to silence. Prew swings the megaphone for the repeat. Then the repeat begins, the clear proud notes reverberating across the silent quadrangle. 
INT. WARDEN'S ROOM OFF SQUAD ROOM - NIGHT 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT KARELSEN lying on his back in his bunk, arms clasped behind his head. He listens, his gnarled face the picture of the old soldier. He breathes heavily as if he is hearing his own requiem and epitaph. 
EXT. PORCH ON BARRACKS - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT There are eight or nine men here now, listening. 
ANOTHER ANGLE SHOOTING INTO THE SHADOWS The two figures feint and dart. There is the occasional silver flash of the knives as light hits them. The men go deeper into the shadows, are all but lost to view. There is a startled, pained cry. Then one of the figures falls to his knees and starts to crawl toward camera. 
CLOSE SHOT SHOOTING NEAR GROUND as the figure comes directly to camera, REVEALING the anguished face of Fatso. It slowly turns, is upside down in the frame. 
MEDIUM SHOT Fatso is on his back, his stomach gushing bloods his eyes already glazing. Prew staggers into the light now. His left side has two vicious cuts; he is bleeding badly. He stares down at Fatso, who manages a small, reproving voice. 
FATSO You've killed me. Why'd you want to kill me? 
Prew backs away from Fatso, turns, staggers down the alley away from camera. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. CLIFF ROAD - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT Prew comes toward camera, laboriously struggling up the road. His side is hemorrhaging steadily, his shirt and trousers blood-soaked. He stops close to camera. He wads his handkerchief, sticks it inside his shirt near the knife wound. He smiles wearily, crookedly. 
PREW (mumbles to himself) Gonna have an awful bad scar there... 
He lights a cigarette, his fingers shaking. The flame from the match illuminates his left wrist. There is a deep scar on it. It seems to fascinate Prew as he stares at it, rubs his fingers across it. 
PREW ... scars... 
He turns, moves on up the road; CAMERA MOVES CLOSE behind him, as if overhearing his thoughts which come over on sound track. 
PREW'S VOICE (O.S.) ... got that one fallin off the barn back home... gashed it on a spike... Dad laughed... Dead now... Uncle John+s dead, too... 
Prew moves away from camera out of shot. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. CLIFF ROAD - NIGHT 
TRACKING SHOT ANOTHER SECTION OF THE ROAD CAMERA FOLLOWS Prew, as he keeps in shadows, moves slowly up the cliff. He is in much pain now. His hand rubs across his face; his fingers linger on his forehead near his eye. 
PREW'S VOICE (O.S.) ... that cut over the eye... in the ring at Myer... wouldn't let `em stop it... knocked the guy out... sixth round... 
CAMERA LOSES Prew again as he stumbles into shadows. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. CLIFF ROAD - NIGHT 
TRACKING SHOT SITE OF PREVIOUS PREW-ALMA SCENE CAMERA FOLLOWS Prew, who is now fighting hard to keep his feet. His hand is pressed tight to his side. 
PREW'S VOICE (O.S.) ... ten stitch gash in the hip... workin in the gym attic... fell through the skylight... where was that?... so many scars... so many years... where they all gone to anyway...? 
He moves on around bend in road out of shot.

INT. ALMA'S HOUSE LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
MEDIUM SHOT ALMA AND GORGETTE The radio is blaring the "Hut Sut Song." Alma is crocheting. Gorgette is reading. CAMERA SHOOTS across them to the front door. The doorknob moves slowly, the door opens. Prew falls into the room and pitches to the floor. 
ALMA PREW -- 
She rushes to him, bends over him. Gorgette runs to the radio, turns it off. 
CLOSE SHOT ALMA Her face agonized as she leans over Prew. 
ALMA Prew! 
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ALMA AND PREW He pushes himself up on one elbow, seems pleased by her stricken expression. He manages a smile. 
PREW (WEAKLY) Don't worry... Ain't gonna die. They savin me for better things... 
Gorgette kneels into shot. Prew's smile becomes silly as he turns his head to her. 
PREW ... just came up to borrow a good book. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. GENERAL'S OFFICE - DAY 
MEDIUM SHOT GENERAL SLATER COLONEL WILLIAMS HOLMES The American flag, the General's flag and the Division flag are the only colorful elements in a rather severe office. Colonel Williams is reading from a typed report. 
COLONEL WILLIAMS --- In addition to inefficiency in administering his command and neglect of duty, Captain Holmes has been guilty of indefensible cruelty to the aforesaid Private Prewitt. This extended to instigating and encouraging wholly unauthorized and discreditable tactics to force the soldier to join the inter-regiment boxing team. These findings are the result of personal investigation by the Inspector General and are corroborated by numerous members of G Company. 
Colonel Williams puts his report on the General's desk. Holmes' face reflects a weary resignation as if underneath he has really expected something like this for a long time. He makes no move to speak. The General is angry clear through. 
GENERAL SLATER I'm waiting for your reply to this. 
HOLMES I haven't any, sir... The charges -- are true. 
GENERAL SLATER Holmes, the first thing I ever learned in the Army was that an officer takes care of his men. It seems to be the first thing you forgot. It's monstrous to think of anybody like you in command of troops. And believe me, you won't be for long. My only regret is that we have to keep you in uniform until a court martial is concluded. (MORE) GENERAL SLATER(cont'd) In the meantime, of course, I'm relieving you of your present duties. 
He indicates the meeting is over. Holmes rises, is about to leave, pauses. 
HOLMES If there were any way to avoid a court martial, sir. Any way... 
The General frowns, is unresponsive. Holmes looks to Colonel Williams helplessly. 
COLONEL WILLIAMS There is one alternative, General... if you're so disposed. A resignation for the good of the service under AR 600-275. 
GENERAL SLATER (thinks a moment) I'll give you a chance you don't deserve, Holmes. Write a letter of resignation and have it on my desk this afternoon. I'll consider accepting it. Only because as far as I'm concerned, the quicker you're out of the Army the better for everybody. Especially the Army. 
PREP (LAUGHS WILDLY) They'll be throwin `em out of the Stockade. They need every man they can get. 
He picks up the sheet of paper with the "Re-enlistment Blues" written out on it, starts to fold it. Desperation is reflected on Alma's face; she turns to Gorgette, as if pleading for aid, 
GORGETTE Your side'll open up -- 
ALMA And they'll find out it was you who killed that soldier! 
Prew shakes his head, as if obsessed by only one thought. 
PREW Once I report in to the Compny I'll be all right. Once I get there. I gotta get back -- 
ALMA But you'll never make it! There's MPs all over -- 
PREW I'll make it. I'll go along the back roads. They'll let me in the West gate -- they'll know I'm a SOLJER -- 
He puts the folded piece of paper in his pocket and starts for the door. 
ALMA Stay till morning! 
Prew glances at Alma incredulously. She sobs suddenly, violently. 
ALMA Maybe if you stayed till morning you'd change your mind... 
She throws her arms around him, clings to him. 
ALMA Don't go, Prew! I'll do whatever you want... We'll figure out a way to get to the States together... We can even get married... If you go I won't see you any more... I know it... 
Prew holds her closely for a moment, then moves her away from him. He turns toward the door. 
ALMA (tears turning to HYSTERIA) What do you want to go back to the Army for?! What did the Army ever do for you? Besides treat you like scum and give you one awful going over and get your friend killed? What do you want to go back to that for? 
Prew frowns as if he's not sure he heard correctly. 
PREW What do I want to go back for? I'm a soljer. 
ALMA (LAUGHING WILDLY) A soldier! A soldier! A Regular. From the Regular Army. A thirty- year man! 
PREW Sure. A thirty-year man. (GRINS) With only twenty-six years to go. 
He opens the door quickly and slips into the darkness. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY ADJOINING GOLF COURSE - NIGHT 
MOVING SHOT JEEP WITH THREE MPs The night is inky black except for a little moonlight and the 
dimmed headlights of the jeep. CAMERA SHOOTS PAST driver onto the highway as the jeep moves slowly along. The two other MPs clutch Thompson guns, try to scan the dark countryside. 
FIRST MP They say they seen parachutists land up in the mountains. 
SECOND MP I ain't worried about them. Sabatoors is what worries me. 
DRIVER Yeah. Theys the creepy ones. Walkin around just like ordinary civilians. I betcha they operatin all over these islands. 
LONG SHOT SHOOTING FROM SIDE OF HIGHWAY The headlights pass along the road as the jeep moves on out of sight. As its sound fades we hear Prew's heavy breathing, are barely able to distinguish his figure in the darkness. He is crouched, watching the car go down the highway. We hear his thoughts. The voice is labored and agonized. 
PREW'S VOICE (O.S.) ... almost home... ony across the golf course... now... now... no... wait... gotta be care?... gotta sweat it out... 
He groans, puts his hand to his side. In the feeble light from the moon we see blood on his shirt and hand. He looks up and down the road. 
PREW'S VOICE (O.S.) ... it's clear now... gotta get home... 
Still crouched, Prew starts across the road. 
LONG SHOT OPPOSITE SIDE OF ROAD We see nothing but the strip of road, then Prew+s figure is visible, bent low, weaving a little. As he approaches the camera, he is taught square in the twin beams of dimmed headlights which flash on from the side of the road. Now we see that a jeep is parked near camera, heading in the opposite direction from the jeep which passed before. It is also manned by three MPs. There is a startled cry from Prew. 
MP'S VOICE Halt! 
Prew starts to run back across the road. A white spotlight flashes on, its harsh brilliant light following him. Prew slips to one knee. 
CLOSE SHOT PREW looking toward the jeep, blinded by the blazing light. He has the appearance of a terrified animal. There is a wildness, a senselessness about him. The blotch of blood oozes and spreads over his shirt. He picks up a rock from the road. 
MEDIUM SHOT Prew rises, staggers away from the jeep. 
MP'S VOICE HALT! 
Prew flings the rock desperately toward the lights. There is a crash of glass and one headlight winks off. Prew runs across the road and onto the golf course. 
MEDIUM SHOT JEEP The motor starts, The jeep moves out from its hiding place and starts across the golf course. 
MOVING SHOT SHOOTING FROM JEEP Prew, in a skirmisher's zigzag, is trying to elude the spotlight. He is about twenty yards in front of the jeep. He heads for a high sandtrap. The spot is full on him as he reaches the lip of the trap. He turns, yells something back at the jeep. It is barely heard over the sound of the jeep. 
PREW -- I'm a soljer! -- 
MP That guy ain't no soljer -- he dint HALT -- 
MEDIUM SHOT PREW standing on the lip of the trap, the jeep bearing down on him. He turns, starts to dive into the trap. A blast of gunfire from the jeep hits him. He falls sideways into the trap, rolls over on his back, The jeep moves into the shot, crawls half-way over the trap, stops, its spotlight pouring down on Prew. His eyes are open, looking up to the sky. 
ANOTHER ANGLE CAMERA SHOOTS DOWN to Prew from top of trap. A portion of the jeep is in shot, but we are not able to see the MPs. 
MP'S VOICE (quavering, almost TEARFUL) (MORE) MP'S VOICE(cont'd) -- maybe he was a soljer -- I dint mean to kill him -- I dint mean it, guys -- you know we got orders -- 
SECOND MP'S VOICE Shut up.

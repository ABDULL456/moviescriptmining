"THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY" -- by Alan Cumming & Jennifer Jason Leigh 
FADE IN: 
TIGHT CLOSE - JOE THERRIAN - MORNING 
He's in his mid-thirties, his face relaxed in sleep, childlike.  Nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife. 
THE CAMERA STAYS CLOSE.  SLIGHTLY BLURRED, SOFT, SLOWLY SWINGS ROUND 
TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY THERRIAN 
She's in her mid-thirties, with large deep eyes.  She watches her husband unguarded in sleep.  Her pretty face, alert, she's barely breathing.  Traces the just visible lines around his eyes, and mouth.  Brushes fingertips against his eyelashes. 
TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY'S HAND PULLS THE BEDROOM SHADE. 
It retracts with a loud WHACK, sun, sky, trees. 
STEVEN (O.S.) And breath...and chataronga... 
EXT. POOL AREA - DAY 
We're in the middle of a yoga lesson.  Joe and Sally stand on their mats.  Steven, their instructor, wanders around the couple issuing soft-spoken instructions. 
A large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge fireplace.  The dining room on one side, living room on the other.  Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch garden pool... The house is classic Neutra.  All GLASS and SMOOTH LINES. 
The calm is broken by the telephone.  Joe and Sally ignore it until the answering machine picks up.  They break their yoga poses and listen. 
The CAMERA hovers over the answering machine. 
LUCY (O.S.) (over answering machine; sweet, British, slightly desperate) Joe, it's Lucy.  Remember me?  It's the black sheep here.  Bah...not funny. Haven't heard from you, need you, call me.  Love you madly.  Hi, Sally.  Joe, I'd love to talk to you before I go... 
JOE Go where? 
LUCY (O.S.) (over answering machine) It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big brother.  Sorry I drone on.  I miss you. I lo-- 
The machine cuts her off. 
NEW ANGLE 
Joe and Sally have resumed their positions.  This wasn't the call they were waiting for. 
WIDE SHOT 
AMERICA, forty-one, and ROSA, fifty, struggle up the steps of the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come through the sliding glass door... 
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM 
Through the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two unpack groceries, flowers, etc., and start to dress the dining room table.  They speak quietly to each other in Spanish. 
JOE America, could you just... 
America closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the dining room, giving the couple their privacy. 
JOE (CONT'D) (calls out) Thank you, America! 
STEVEN Okay, let's just take a deep breath, let your ribs expand and relax.  And reach up and into downward dog. 
Otis, the Bisenji/Sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard pillow, stirs, stretches and groans. 
JOE AND SALLY Good boy, Otis. 
The phone RINGS again. 
VOICE (O.S.) (over answering machine) Hello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for Sally Therrian. 
Sally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the phone, all angles. 
SALLY Hello, hi, hi...and?  Thank God. 
Sally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to Joe. 
EXT. POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS 
Joe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the teacher waiting a sign.  Sally returns to the lesson.  They do their handstands against the wall, on either side of the front door. 
JOE For good. 
They begin to make love...the phone RINGS. 
JOE (CONT'D) Don't get it. 
SALLY Well, it might be Clair.  They're threatening not to come... 
JOE What? 
SALLY They can't find a sitter... (into the receiver) Hello?  Excuse me?  Yes, uh, hold on. (she looks at Joe) Just a moment. (puts the call on hold) It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party? 
JOE Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her. 
SALLY You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother. 
JOE She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold. 
SALLY (pissed) No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake. 
JOE (regards her) You want me to uninvite her? 
SALLY No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two? 
She gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom.  The CAMERA is with her. 
SALLY (CONT'D) (into the bathroom mirror) And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake. 
JOE (into the receiver) Skye! (his face lights) I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually. (flattered) You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left. 
Sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the doorway.  He meets her eyes mid-sentence. 
JOE (CONT'D) Oh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure they're well behaved.  All our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So we sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry. 
He rolls his eyes.  Sally walks back into the bathroom, she isn't buying it. 
JOE (O.S.) (CONT'D) I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really. 
SALLY (into the bathroom mirror) I'm going to throw up. 
JOE (O.S.) I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna. 
SALLY (sanguine) Really? 
INT. BEDROOM - LATER 
The doorbell rings.  There are two closed doors on either side of the room.  The bed shows no sign of consummated sex. Joe comes through the left hand door, nearly dressed. 
JOE Who the fuck can be here at this time? It's not even seven! 
Sally comes through the other door, one shoe off, one on. 
SALLY Oh Jesus, who else is always early for Christ's sake? 
NEW ANGLE 
Sally kisses his cheek on her way to the door. 
SALLY (CONT'D) Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors. 
JOE I'll say as little as possible. 
Sally exits the bedroom. 
HOLD ON JOE 
For a moment, then Sally re-enters, kisses him deeply. 
SALLY I love you. 
INT. FOYER - EARLY EVENING 
The house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements, candles everywhere. 
JERRY and JUDY ADAMS are on the porch, just beyond the glass of the front door.  Their argument is inaudible.  They're in their mid-thirties, conservatively dressed.  She's stunning, genetically nervous.  Jerry carries a briefcase.  She's got the gift. 
JERRY They're paying him scale. 
The CAMERA catches sight of Joe behind them.  He moves through the foyer and into the living room with a tray of glasses and Judy in tow. 
SALLY He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here. 
JERRY There's still time to undo this. 
SALLY (kisses his cheek) We'll be fine. 
JERRY (re: barking dog) Did you invite them? 
SALLY The Roses?  And of course they said yes. 
JERRY That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them. 
SALLY Whatever you say. 
JERRY Did you tell Joe to behave? 
SALLY Yes. 
JERRY Did he promise? 
SALLY Scout's honor. 
JERRY Before I forget. (pulls a novel from his briefcase) Put it on the bookshelf. 
She flips the book -- on the back is a full page picture of RYAN ROSE. 
SALLY You're out of your mind. 
JERRY Just do what I say, alright? 
SALLY How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do? 
JERRY Beats a lawsuit. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Joe and Judy sit on opposite sides of the sofa -- slightly uncomfortable with each other. 
JOE (to fill the silence, conspiratorial grin) I love gifts.  What did you guys get us? 
JUDY (chokes on the champagne) Nothing that can't be exchanged. 
JOE Oh.  Well.  Good. 
JUDY Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book. 
JOE The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead. 
JUDY Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful. 
JOE Yes, she is. 
JUDY (trying harder) But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally. 
JOE It's a novel. 
JUDY Still.  Well.  Let's drop it. 
JOE Yes. 
JUDY I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron? 
JOE No. 
JUDY It's very good. (a moment) I understand you won the Booker Prize. 
JOE Yes I did. 
JUDY (another moment) Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find? 
JOE Don't I find what? 
MONICA Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house. 
SALLY Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator. 
MONICA Yes. 
SALLY I so wish I'd known. 
MONICA Well, whoever did this is amazing. 
SALLY I did it. 
JOE (comes on them with the Forsythes in tow) She rarely cops to it. (kisses Sally's cheek) Otis is home. 
CLAIR (re: the gifts) Where can I put these? 
Sally takes the gifts from her. 
CLAIR (CONT'D) What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number. 
SALLY Of course. 
MAC She already has. 
CLAIR It's alright, isn't it? 
SALLY Of course it's alright. 
MAC Clair is a hovering mother. 
CLAIR I'm not. 
SALLY This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair. 
Clair takes a glass of champagne off the tray as they make their way down the hall. 
CLAIR (a wide professionally ingratiating smile) So nice... 
MONICA And for us... Truly. 
CLAIR Well... 
MONICA You will never know. 
CLAIR (pleased) Oh. (to Sally) I have a four-thirty call.  AM.  So we may have to leave early. 
SALLY Why didn't you bring him? 
CLAIR What? 
SALLY Why didn't you bring him? 
CLAIR (searches) He's allergic. 
SALLY Oh. 
CLAIR To dander.  Otis. 
SALLY Oh. 
CLAIR Didn't I say? 
SALLY Well, probably. 
CLAIR They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up. 
SALLY (muted) Oh. 
The Roses are happy to stand there on the fringe.  Next to someone they've only seen on screen and magazine covers. 
Clair's not in the least put off by them.  She manages to smile at them inclusively from time to time. 
CLAIR So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course. (kisses her cheek) How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore. 
MAC (as grounded as Clair isn't) It's an object lesson in grace. (on seeing Cal Gold on the back porch) Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once. 
SOPHIA (to Monica) Would you like to meet my husband? 
It's all Monica can do to keep from putting her hand to her chest. 
MONICA I'd be thrilled. 
SOPHIA Then he'll be thrilled. 
She ushers them toward the living room. 
JOE (re: Sophia, appreciative) She's such pure evil. 
Sally approaches, gives Gina a warm kiss on the chest. 
SALLY Thanks for coming. 
GINA Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two. (to Joe) Can you help me with this stuff? 
JOE (re: one of her bags) That for us? 
GINA What a nose.  You missed your calling. 
JOE Can I open it? 
GINA (defers) Sally? 
JOE Please? 
SALLY He's impossible.  Go on then. 
Joe rips open the gift.  It's a framed black and white of Joe, Sally and Otis lying on the couch.  It's clear which photos in the house are Gina's.  It's a breathtaking print, an amazing caught moment.  All light and shadow.  A touching study. 
SALLY (CONT'D) (respectful of the talent) It's beautiful, thank you so much. 
Joe, moved somehow, hugs Gina to him.  Kisses her. 
JOE I love you,  Gina Taylor. 
Sally's uncomfortable, a little jealous... feels intrusive. Aware that Gina got there first.  Knew him when.  And always captures something naked and vulnerable in his face. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
In the center of the room a low table with paints and crayons and glue and baubles.  Two child size chairs either side. Empty, the table hasn't been touched. 
Evie stands against the far wall.  She wears a helmet and is surrounded by toy suction arrows.  The arrows make a perfect outline of her head and body.  Jack stands three feet away, bow in hand -- the archer prepares his next shot. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
Cal is at the piano, charming the neighbors.  Judy chats with Mac.  Jerry is on his cellphone, holding his Palm Pilot, his hand pressed against his ear to block out the chatter.  Sally joins Cal on the piano stool.  Sophia moves to Clair on the couch, kisses her cheek. 
SOPHIA You look so well, Clair.  A wraith. 
CLAIR (pleased) You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know. 
SOPHIA I'm glad that's all over for me. 
CLAIR Don't you miss it? 
SOPHIA Never. 
CLAIR Really. 
SOPHIA Not for a second.  Cal can have all that. 
CLAIR Really? 
SOPHIA So where is young Jonah? 
CLAIR With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids. 
She inadvertently touches the beeper on her belt, and it beeps.  She jumps. 
SOPHIA What is that thing? 
PANES Not enough. 
Sally takes Panes into the living room where everyone chats, drinks, smokes.  They all like each other out of habit, if nothing else.  Ryan and Monica are on the fringe, stand at the edges of conversation.  There's always someone at the piano, and they can all pretty much play. 
SALLY Panes is here! 
PANES (gives everyone a shy, pained little wave) Oh great. 
Everyone stops, turns, toasts. 
EVERYONE Panes! 
MONICA/RYAN (a little late; into silence) Panes. 
Panes gives them another little wave.  Doorbell rings. 
TIGHT CLOSE - SKYE DAVIDSON 
SKYE Hi. 
She's the young, beautiful actress who'll play the lead in Joe's film. 
JOE (his face lights up) Skye! 
She's in jeans, but somehow looks dressed to the 9s. 
SKYE You're Joe, aren't you? (nods knowingly) I recognized you from the book jacket. 
Joe grins from ear to ear.  Uncharacteristically star struck in front of this beauty. 
JOE How do you do, Skye? 
SKYE Oh, I love that. (throws arms around him) I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are. 
JOE (uncomfortable) Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends. 
SKYE (genuine) When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual... 
JOE I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you. 
SKYE You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director. 
There's a long moment. 
JOE (finally) I think you're my first Goddess. 
Sally and Panes have been watching from the living room. 
PANES She's even better looking in the flesh. 
SALLY Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me. 
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
America and Rosa are working at the counter, Panes and Sally come through. 
SALLY Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house. 
PANES You don't know she's a bitch. 
SALLY She's all over him, are you blind? 
PANES It could be worse. 
SALLY How? 
PANES She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours. 
SALLY Fuck you, Panes. 
PANES You see, that's worse. 
SALLY I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love. 
PANES Like your business managers? 
SALLY (under her breath) Thank you, thank you, thank you. 
CLAIR (on the way down; a dream in white) My God, your wardrobe is incredible.  It took me forever to decide.  Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you.  You saved my life. 
She moves past them. 
SALLY (a moment; sotto) Shit! 
PANES (re: the dress) I'd cut off her red wine if I were you. 
SALLY Shit.  It's my Galiano. 
PANES What does that mean? 
SALLY About five thousand dollars.  With my discount. 
The CAMERA follows them into the bedroom.  They flop down onto the bed and into FRAME. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
More guests have arrived.  Sophia and her children play with Otis.  America and Rosa pass round hot hors d'oeuvres. 
Joe places Gina's photo on the mantelpiece. 
GINA (regards him) Directing suits you. 
JOE I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months. 
GINA It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden. 
JOE Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked. 
GINA Just did.  Jealous? 
JOE When does he graduate high school? 
GINA (laughing) Oh, very jealous. 
Joe laughs. 
GINA (CONT'D) I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her. 
JOE Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold. 
GINA In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry. 
JOE I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million. 
GINA Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job. 
JOE You really need to be fucked. 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
SALLY So how are you really doing, Panes? 
PANES Why don't you go fuck yourself? 
SALLY (laughs) No.  Really.  For real.  Really. 
PANES I'm worried about your Galiano. 
SALLY (slaps him) You're a shit. 
PANES No, really, five thousand with your discount. 
He rolls out from under her swat, she misses him. 
PANES (CONT'D) You hurt, you know.  You're stronger than you think. 
They lie prone across the bed, about a foot apart. Contemplating the floor. 
PANES (CONT'D) (finally) How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you? 
SALLY Yes.  Fine. 
GINA When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows... 
People hoot, throw their cocktail napkins. 
GINA (CONT'D) What? 
SKYE Utopia Parkway... 
They all start talking on top of each other again. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER 
The teams have come together. 
JOE Who's keeping time? 
Mac raises his hand on Sally's side, Jerry on Joe's. 
JOE (CONT'D) Two minutes. 
SALLY (deferring first turn to Joe) It's alright.  Be our guests. 
She offers the hat. 
JOE (offers the hat) You darling. 
Panes reaches into the hat. 
PANES (reads clue; to Joe) What is it? 
Joe whispers to him. 
PANES (CONT'D) What's a sign for that? 
JOE Come on, Panes... 
JERRY Go! 
Panes mimes a belly laugh. 
JEFFREY What the hell is that? 
SALLY What is it Panes? 
Panes sighs. 
SOPHIA Two words. 
He belly laughs. 
JUDY Funny. 
A finger to his nose - elongate the word. 
SANFORD Funnies? 
Panes does an "ON THE NOSE."  Gets on all fours.  Licks his paws. 
RYAN The Katzenjammer Kids. 
The team applauds delight.  Panes preens.  Joe's team looks over at Monica. 
JERRY (already pissed) It's only just started.  Great.  The husband's on the other fucking team. 
Jerry reaches into the hat.  Looks at the clue. 
MAC Go. 
JERRY Hey!  Would you? 
MAC It was fifteen seconds. 
JERRY I don't think so. 
MAC Are you always this much fun? 
Gina loses it, cracks up. 
MAC Time. 
TIME CUT TO: 
Jeffrey's on his feet, giving the clue. 
SALLY'S TEAM (unison) Quote.  Play. 
SOPHIA Oh shit.  It's one of Cal's.  Obscure Shakespeare, folks. 
Cal gives her a little wave from the other side. 
SOPHIA (CONT'D) (calls over to him) Maybe something original for a change. 
Cal blows her a kiss. 
SALLY'S TEAM (in unison) Ten...twenty...thirty...seven, eight. Thirty-eighth word...thirty-seventh word. 
Gina's been taking shots through the course of the game, and the FRAME will freeze black and white on one of another delicious moment.  There's a spectacular shot of Sally, unaware, laughing, sad soft eyes on Joe. 
MEDIUM CLOSE - AMERICA 
She watches the game from the archway, waits for a break. Sky's up.  Joe's team yells frantic guesses.  Jerry's suicidal. 
Sally's team watches, self-satisfied, throw barbed asides. 
SALLY (to Joe's look; innocence) I didn't say a word. 
MAC Time! 
JERRY What was it?  What the fuck was it? 
SALLY (small grin) Ryan's novel. 
JERRY Ryan's novel? 
JUDY Ryan's novel, Jerry. 
AMERICA (sings out) Dinner! 
SALLY Still champions. 
JOE Panes is not on your team anymore. 
PANES What did I do? 
SALLY Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like. 
AMERICA Dinner. 
SALLY Dinner. 
JOE It's an unfair advantage. 
SALLY You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers. 
JOE Okay, knock it off. 
SALLY Truce? 
JOE Truce. 
SALLY Dinner. (on the move) Don't be angry. 
JOE (pissed) I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake. 
EXT. POOL AREA - MAGIC HOUR 
Evie and Jake run along the side of the house.  Behind the glass walls the CAMERA catches adults moving through the living room and into the dining room. 
INT. DINING ROOM - MAGIC HOUR 
Most everyone's moved through to the dining room.  The table is filled with platters of beautifully prepared food. Candles, flowers. 
GINA Escape hatch. 
JOE (eyes her) Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted... 
SALLY Not properly watered. 
JOE Whatever! (to Gina) You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day... 
SALLY/JEFFREY I realized I had become a man.  Ta da! 
GINA You're not a man, Joe.  You're a boy. 
JOE (childishly) So? 
GINA (laughs) I love you, Joe Therrian. 
SALLY (at a loss, small) Me too. 
Sophia watches from across the living room. 
NEW ANGLE 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Astrid squeezes in next to Sally, on her second portion of everything.  She allows Anouk to nibble from her plate. 
ASTRID You're not upset that I brought the dog? 
SALLY Would it make a difference? 
ASTRID Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new. (fixes on Ryan) Who's that? 
SALLY You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor. 
ASTRID Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out? 
SALLY You're fucking desperate. 
ASTRID Like you didn't know. (re: Skye) Who invited the bimbo? 
SALLY One guess. 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
The CAMERA stays close on the cake as America wheels the cart into the living room.  The top of it sports Sally and Joe's faces on either side of Otis, a detailed edible photograph. There are three sixes across the top. 
There's a freed up pathway.  Cal taps the side of his champagne glass with a fork. 
SOPHIA (re: the cake as it comes in) Part of our gift.  Honey!! 
CAL (clinks his glass) Here, here. 
Clair picks up discarded dinner plates.  Otis takes care of those behind couches, under tables. 
The gifts are stacked high, near the fireplace.  Sally is on the floor, nestled between Joe's knees, leaning back against him.  His arms are wrapped around her, face pressed against hers. 
There's a SERIES OF CUTS through speeches, gifts, entertainment.  Sophia and Cal do a well rehearsed, very funny, impromptu something with their kids. 
Panes and Mac do an interpretive dance symbolizing the marriage. 
Cal and Sophia carry sleeping children down the hall. 
There are speeches about Sally and Joe, outrageously dirty, funny, sometimes touching - that cover their recent separation, the custody of Otis, their trying to have a baby... 
Panes plays a piece on the violin.  Someone else sings.  And finally... 
MEDIUM CLOSE - SKYE 
She looks out at the guests... 
NEW ANGLE 
They look back at her. 
SKYE I wasn't prepared to say anything.  I'm honored to be a part of tonight.  To be in the same room, with my favorite living actress... 
MONICA I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan. (touches her own cheek, ever so lightly; shivers against the sensation) Utterly fantastic. 
RYAN You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water. 
MONICA Do you want to go home, Ryan? 
RYAN Yes. 
MONICA I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila. 
RYAN I'm not going to leave you alone. 
MONICA They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us... 
RYAN They're nothing like us. 
MONICA I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people... 
She puts arms around him, kisses his cheek.  He stiffens. 
RYAN Are you making an ass of yourself? 
MONICA There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need... 
RYAN I don't need a drug. 
MONICA You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words. 
She gets up. 
RYAN Ready to go? 
MONICA I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry. (turns back) Ryan, you're a great man. 
The CAMERA follows Monica along the side of the pool.  She passes Sophia and a very exuberant Clair. 
The CAMERA stays at the pool.  Clair tears off Sally's Galiano, flings it to the ground and dives topless into the pool. 
CLAIR This water is great! 
JERRY (swimming past her) Wanna dive for a baton? 
MEDIUM CLOSE UP - JUDY 
She stands at the side of the pool. 
JUDY Okay, I'm about to throw five colored batons in the water.  Then I'm going to count to three, and then you may start diving.  I'm playing too.  The red one is ten extra points.  Ready? (she throws batons in) One, two, three, go!! 
There is a melee of diving and screaming. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BACKYARD LANDING 
It's at the end of a bridge, overlooking the pool.  Voices drift up from below.  Mac and Joe walk in circles pacing around one another. 
MAC You got your DP? 
JOE What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list. 
MAC And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies? 
JOE Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac? 
MAC Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you. 
JOE Thanks, Mac. (regards him) And thanks for being so supportive about all this. (throws arm around him, hugs him close) I really love you, you know. 
MAC Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do. 
JOE (lets go of Mac) God, I really need to jump about a bit. (begins jumping) How's your film going? 
CAL It's going.  It's going. 
JOE And how's the diva doing? 
MAC (moans) No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck. 
INT. CORRIDOR - CLOSE SHOT - SALLY 
She backs up into the corridor mortified.  Leans against the wall. 
CAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.) It's preposterous.  You're free to do whatever you like. 
SALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. Yes, well, we'll see won't we? 
MAC (O.S.) Jesus Christ. 
SALLY (a deep breath) Well...wow... 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Clair's started down the hallway, reaches the landing.  Sally rushes into the guest bedroom to avoid her.  Clair, just missing Sally, wanders into the dailies room. 
INT. DAILIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
CLAIR Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy. 
MAC I'm in mourning. 
CLAIR You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do. 
MAC Not this time. 
CLAIR It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone. 
She walks in front of the television set, blocks it with her body, switches it off. 
MAC (an observation) You don't have any clothes on. 
CLAIR How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious. (re: the film) You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas. 
MAC Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth. 
CLAIR Things always look much worse in the morning. 
MAC I don't know how to make her funny. 
CLAIR You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie. 
MAC (really stoned) What what's about? 
CLAIR I...wait, what are you talking about? 
INT. GUEST ROOM 
MEDIUM CLOSE 
Jack and Evie are asleep across the bed. 
NEW ANGLE 
Sally sits at the edge of the bed, regards the sleeping children.  Reaches over and smoothens the tangled, tousled hair.  Studies their faces. 
EXT. POOLSIDE - JOE'S POV 
Monica sits on the steps of the pool.  She looks frightened, uncomfortable. 
JOE Are you okay? 
MONICA I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny. 
JOE Let's go for a walk. 
He puts his arm around her and leads her away from the pool. 
EXT. BACKYARD LANDING - NIGHT 
MONICA I've never done this before. 
JOE Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl. 
JOE Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate. 
MONICA (horrified) I'm sorry. 
SALLY (raging) There's a goddamn sign on the gate. 
MONICA I'm so sorry. 
SALLY You fucking cow, can't you read?! 
MONICA (at a loss) I... 
SALLY How long ago was it? 
JOE Stop being such a bitch, Sal. 
MONICA I'm so sorry. 
JOE It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis. 
SALLY Don't be so sure. 
JOE Listen to yourself... (to Monica) Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him. (to Sally) What's wrong with you? 
SALLY (re: Monica) She left the fucking gate open. 
JOE Well he can't have gone far. 
SALLY Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away. 
JOE He'll find his way back. 
SALLY There are fucking coyotes out there. 
JOE (calming) Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical. 
Monica retreats, backs off a step or two. 
SALLY Fuck you. 
JOE Or shitty!!  Otis!! 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
America and Rosa are cleaning up.  Ryan hangs around chatting. 
RYAN How long have you worked for the Therrians? 
AMERICA (shrugs, polite but annoyed) A long time. 
RYAN So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence? 
AMERICA Oh yes. 
RYAN Did you know the contractor? 
AMERICA Very well. 
RYAN Was it a contractor? 
AMERICA It's the way they do things. 
RYAN To code? 
Her back is to him.  She exchanges a glance with Rosa, and the Spanish equivalent of "who is this wanker?" 
RYAN (CONT'D) Did you see permits?  Did he have a license? 
AMERICA You should talk to Mr. Joe. 
Monica bursts into the room. 
MONICA Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog. 
SALLY Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted. 
JOE Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier. 
SALLY Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties. 
JOE Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect! 
SALLY What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here. 
JOE Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this. 
SALLY Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come! 
JOE Otis! 
SALLY I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way. 
JOE Love? 
SALLY You walked out on a five year marriage. 
JOE That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time. 
SALLY It's not like this all the time. 
JOE DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying. 
SALLY And how hard it hit? 
JOE Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this. 
SALLY You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you. 
JOE Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second... 
SALLY You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do. 
JOE That is not true. 
SALLY It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone. 
JOE Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy. 
SALLY Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her? 
Joe is silent. 
SALLY (CONT'D) And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that... 
JOE It's a novel. 
SALLY About me! 
JOE Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally. 
SALLY What are you saying? 
JOE Hello?  Last birthday was? 
SALLY I don't look my age, Joe. 
JOE Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently. 
SALLY It's a shit novel anyway. 
JOE Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress. 
SALLY Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway. 
JOE Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally. 
SALLY Who?  Who?  Who thinks that? 
JOE Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally. 
EXT. POOL - CONTINUOUS 
Jerry pulls Mac to the surface.  Clair and Judy are out of the pool.  Jerry drags the limp body from the pool, pumps Mac's chest - it's clear he knows what he's doing.  Mac coughs up a load of water. 
CLAIR Oh my God.  Honey??? 
There's a moment.  Mac begins to sob. 
JERRY He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room? 
MAC (his face against concrete) Man, I must really be stoned. (wipes tears from his face with his hand) Thanks, buddy. 
CLAIR Honey? 
Mac raises his hand, arrests her from coming nearer. 
MAC I'm fine, babe. 
JERRY Give him a minute, Clair. 
MAC (humiliated) Hey. (looks over at Jerry) Thanks, buddy. 
JERRY Anytime, sport. 
MAC (wants to say "don't call me sport") Yeah, thanks pal. 
CLAIR (helpless) Honey? 
They all stand around watching him.  Mac gets up. 
MAC I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close. 
JERRY Probably not. 
MAC (to Jerry) So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what? 
JUDY There's a test, you know. 
JERRY (embarrassed) Forget it, Judy. 
CLAIR (still scared) Honey? 
MAC I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute. 
The CAMERA stays on Mac as he walks around the side of the house, down the steps through the basement. 
INT. BASEMENT - MEDIUM FULL SHOT 
Mac begins to tremble, sob convulsively.  He bites down on his lip, clinches his first, tries to pull himself together. 
MAC (paces; at himself) You're okay.  Buck up.  Come on, be a man.  It could happen to anybody. (tears start again) If you don't stop, I'm going to punch your face in. (another moment) 
He pulls a towel off a stack and they all fall on the floor. 
MAC (CONT'D) Oh shit.  I can't fucking do anything right.  Come on, come on.  Oh thank you God for giving me this chance.  Thank you for having Jerry here to save me.  I promise I will never cheat on my wife again.  I will never take drugs again, and I will be a great fucking husband and a loving father.  I am a great father!  I have terrific friends.  I am a brilliant director.  Well-respected.  I won a Golden Globe, how 'bout that?  Yeah, man, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright. And God, I will be humble. 
INT. MUSIC LIBRARY - MEDIUM FULL SHOT 
Gina regards the photographs she brought for Joe and Sally. She lifts it from the shelf, the phone rings, the machine picks up. 
MAN'S VOICE Joe, Joe!  It's your Dad!  Pick up, Joe... 
Gina sets the photo on the desk, leans it up against the wall.  Joe and Sally's faces stare out of it. 
GINA (picks up receiver) Harry, hi, it's Gina!  Gina.  Is everything alright? (a deep intake of breath) Oh my God.  When?  He's not here. They're out looking for Otis.  The dog, Harry. (tears start down her face) I love you so much.  Lucy's a fighter, she'll make it.  Whether she wants to or not.  Harry.  I'm so sorry.  I will. (writes down the number) Yes I will.  Take care, Harry.  Bye. 
She puts down the phone.  Stares into Joe's face, looks up at a photo on the wall that she took of Joe and Lucy. 
EXT. BACKYARD LANDING 
Jerry and Judy are making out. 
JUDY Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero? 
JERRY You're crazy baby.  I love you. 
Joe's legs give way.  He sort of sits on the floor. 
JOE (laughs; shakes his head) Stupid tart. 
GINA She left a note. 
JOE (realizes the import; to Gina) Fuck you. 
Tears start down Sally's face. 
GINA You need to call your dad. 
JOE Leave us alone right now. 
GINA I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go. 
SALLY Would you leave us alone right now? 
GINA I love her too, Joe. 
JOE Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now? 
SALLY (a shrug; simply) Everybody hates the messenger. 
Gina exits. 
SALLY (CONT'D) (to Joe) I'm coming with you. 
Joe starts to cry.  Sally holds him, kisses him, strokes him, rocks him. 
JOE (inconsolable) I don't want you to go. 
He wipes tears away that start afresh; his nose is running, he wipes that too. 
JOE (CONT'D) I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight. 
SALLY I'll be with you. 
JOE I don't want to go tonight. 
SALLY You don't have to. 
They sit on the floor.  Sally soothing, rocking Joe like a baby. 
JOE (bereft) Stupid tart. 
INT. KITCHEN - LATER 
Gina's put up some coffee.  Sophia, Cal, Mac and Clair stand around awkwardly.  Sally comes into the room. 
MAC How's he doing? 
SALLY Not good. 
GINA He's gonna miss his flight. 
SALLY Yeah. 
Al the guests are a little stunned. 
GINA Is he not going?  I booked a flight. 
SALLY He's not going tonight. 
GINA I told his father he'd be on that flight. 
SALLY Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight. 
GINA Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy. 
SALLY And you're not the wife. 
GINA It's not a contest. 
SALLY Damn straight. 
EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Monica and Ryan return from their unsuccessful search.  They come through the gate with it's sight: KEEP GATE CLOSED. Monica and Ryan start for the kitchen entrance. 
INT. KITCHEN - FROM MONICA AND RYAN'S POV 
Sally and Joe are alone in the room.  They hold each other, weep... 
RYAN (appalled) Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog! 
MONICA (regards them) Don't go in, Ryan. 
RYAN What? 
MONICA Let's just go home, okay? 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
A much embarrassed Panes and Skye enter. 
PANES Coffee? 
JOE Sure. 
PANES I'll do it.

SALLY You don't need to do that. 
SKYE I don't mind... 
SALLY Relax.  You've done enough. 
EXT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
We see Judy and Jerry bounding around the side of the house. Jerry has his briefcase in his hand.  They are laughing. They enter the kitchen.  The camera stays outside.  We see them brought up short by the gloom, but hear nothing. 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Sally and Joe are at the table, signing their tax returns. Jerry supervising.  All is quiet.  Judy's sunk into a chair. 
INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

SALLY Sure. 
HE slips into the tub with her.  They lie there facing each other. 
OE My plane leaves in a few hours. 
SALLY Okay.  Do you want me to come with you?

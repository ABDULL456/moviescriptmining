BURLESQUE 
Written by 
Steven Antin 
TITLE SEQUENCE OVER MUSIC A series of tight CLOSE-UP shots of dancers moving in high energy fast paced sexy choreography. Very provocative. Legs. Arms. Butts. Boas. Sequins. Costumes. High heels. A kaleidoscope of images and colors. 
END TITLES ON A BLACK SCREEN FADE IN sounds of PEOPLE TALKING -- GLASSES CLINKING -- all the BACKGROUND SOUNDS of a BUSY, HIP NIGHTCLUB. SUDDENLY.. .a loud DRUM ROLL. CAMERA is low, moving through BACKSTAGE, passing CURTAINS and the WINGS, flying out onto a shiny black STAGE awash in light. PUSH IN on FOOTLIGHTS which are now blinding us, blasting into camera as they form the word... 
BURLESQUE DRUM ROLL ends with a CYMBAL CRASH. The SCREEN goes BLACK. Then we hear an opening MUSIC "INTRO", a bawdy QUARTET. EXTREME CLOSE UP: RED LUSCIOUS LIPS... speaking directly into CAMERA in a smoky, sultry voice. 
TESS Once upon a time ...a long, looong time ago... there was a good little girl...and they called her... REVEAL ...TESS. A stunner with impossibly long lashes, theatrical make-up and a sequined, skin-tight band-aid of a dress. She works the tight stage of the club, toying with the AUDIENCE. 
TESS (CONT'D) Burlesque. MUSIC BLARES from a HOT YOUNG BUMPER BAND -- sax, drums, bass -- wearing bowler hats, suspenders and lots of ink. The crowd HOOTS. Lame streamers EXPLODE from the stage. 
TESS (CONT'D) Some say she up and died-of neglect. Abandonment. 
(WHISPER) .old age. The club's red booths are about half-full with a hip crowd. Walls cluttered with photos. Celebrities tucked in shadows. 
TESS (CONT'D) But I say...no matter how hard you try, you can't keep a good girl down. And I've got a bevy of 'em. 
INT. BACKSTAGE DRESSING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A DOZEN gorgeous, leggy GIRLS fight for the mirror. Miles of skin. Heavy make-up. Lashes. Boobs. Butts. Fishnets. Boas. And SEQUINS. Oceans of them. It's definitely decadent. Completely cabaret. 
TESS (O.S.) Come to think of it, none of them are all that good, which isn't all that bad... SEAN (31), a cute gay guy with an armful of accessories pushes his way through the girls and in a blur, tightens a corset, tosses a boa, adjusts a garter just so. 
TESS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Eight shows a week. Sixteen gorgeous girls. Thirty-two towers of luscious legs... 
BACK ON TESS -- Behind her, our GIRLS slink onto the stage one by one. 
TESS (CONT'D) Say hello to Scarlett. Jesse. Anna. Coco-puff. And Georgie-Girl. The girls gather at the edge of the stage, lit by footlights, moving in place to the beat of the INTRO MUSIC. Hips sway. Fingers snap. Tess weaves playfully between them. 
TESS (CONT'D) All of them the creme-de la creme. 
(CYMBAL CRASH) De la creme. The girls strike nasty, (but funny) provocative poses, etc... 
TESS (CONT'D) Each one a bastion of bodacious... (Coco bends over, peers between her legs) Elegance. TWO GIRLS upside down on chairs NAIL aerial splits. 
TESS (CONT'D) Not to mention their other... (smacks Coco on the ass) Ass-ets. Coco raises a brow, moves her butt to a LOUD BUMP-AND-GRIND. 
TESS (CONT'D) Welcome to the Burlesque Lounge, dead smack in the center of the Sunset Strip-- did I say "strip?" (cat calls from audience) I meant TEASE... FOOTLIGHTS FLARE, UPLIGHTING THE GIRLS. They shift their weight, hitting the beats with risque moves and hip-thrusts as they MOVE DOWNSTAGE suggestively toward the audience to the MUSIC... 
EXT. MAIN STREET, GRUNDY, IOWA - NIGHT 
A small, grime-streaked steel town, hanging on by the skin of its teeth. Boarded-up storefronts, a run-down A&P. CAMERA MOVES past an old sign: WELCOME TO GRUNDY!!! and lands on a broken neon sign that reads "DWIG 'S BAR" It flickers so you can read the name: DWIGHT'S. Then goes back to DWIG. 
INT. DWIGHT'S BAR - SAME 
Chipped paint. Old beer posters. A few pathetic customers. Beer on tap. Pinball standing lonely in the corner. A REGULAR drains his beer, tosses down a quarter and starts to leave. Someone stops short at the table. 
ALI Uh, excuse me? You forgot something. He turns. Sees: ALI ROSE. One hand holding a bar rag, the other planted on her hip. Ali has a look that's all her own: short shorts, white platform sandals, hair piled up high, more make-up than the rest of Grundy's women combined. She's young -- 22 -- but has a confidence that's got nothing to do with age. 
REGULAR No, that's your tip. 
ALI Huh. See, now that's interesting -- you and I must do math completely differently, cause me? I start with the six beers I brought you, add the four spills I cleaned up, the five times I refilled your peanuts, plus the three times you "accidentally" touched my ass, then I tack on lying to your wife when she called looking for you, twice, and I come up with a sum that's a hell of a lot more than twenty-five cents. Before the Regular can respond, Ali is joined by LORETTA -- 30's wearing every one of those years hard. 
LORETTA She's just teasing, Ike. You go on home now, and tell Kay I said hi. The Regular leaves. Loretta picks up the quarter. 
LORETTA (CONT'D) It's better than nothing. 
ALI Nothin's cheap. A quarter's an insult. 
LORETTA It'll cover half a load down at the Spanky Clean. 
ALI There's only one thing a quarter is good for. Ali takes the quarter and heads to the back of the room, passing a GEEZER who's sitting by himself, drinking alone. 
LORETTA Oh no, hon, now you know how Dwight feels about that. 
ALI Dwight isn't here. Ali stops in front of the rinky-dink karaoke machine. 
LORETTA He could come back any minute. 
ALI Tough. I'm not working here for the tips Loretta. She pops the quarter into the machine and chooses a song. She picks up the microphone and, after a few opening beats, starts singing ETTA JAMES'S "SOMETHING'S GOT A HOLD ON ME". 
ALI (CONT'D) 
OOOOOOOOOH, SOMETIMES I GET A GOOD 
FEELING, Y-E-A-H And now we see where the confidence comes from. She's got a voice that's way too big for this town-- the kind that reaches way down inside you and rattles things loose. WE HEAR the same song continue as we INTERCUT with: 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT 
The Girls undulate at the footlights as they sing the chorus: 
BURLESQUE GIRLS 
YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHHHH... 
NIKKI I heard that. Nikki, a stunning, feisty brunette, sashays in-- 
TESS Jesus, Nikki, you're later than Georgia's period! Where were you? 
NIKKI Weave, wax, paws and claws. She drops her bag, quickly peels her clothes off, holds out her arms as Sean slips her corset onto her-- Tess eyes Nikki's body-- 
TESS Hold it right there. Weigh in. Nikki unwillingly steps on the scale. Tess shakes her head. 
TESS (CONT'D) Put on five pounds or I bump you. Nikki protests as Sean double-takes at Georgia -- who FLITS BY with a slightly protruding belly. 
EXT. TRAILER PARK - IOWA - NIGHT 
Ali winds her way through the trailers, carrying a bag of take-out, with a swing in her step -- moving to music playing in her head. She reaches a double-wide, lets herself in. 
ALI Nanna? Got your pot roast here! 
INT. ALI'S TRAILER - NIGHT 
TV noise. She comes in, kicks off her heels. 
ALI They were out of steak fries, so I got you some of those... Then she stops in her tracks. Nanna -- 80's, housecoat, oxygen tank -- is slumped in her chair. The TV remote is on the floor. "ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT" is blaring. 
ALI (CONT'D) Nanna? 
EXT. CEMETERY - IOWA - DAY 
Loretta and Ali, at the grave with a MINISTER who looks to be about 17. A CEMETERY WORKER is nearby, picking his teeth with a toothpick. 
YOUNG MINISTER Dear Lord, we gather here today not to mourn, but to celebrate the life of Alison Rose. 
ALI Arlene. 
YOUNG MINISTER What? 
ALI She's Arlene. I'm Alison. 
YOUNG MINISTER Oh, shit. (then, befuddled) Can I start over? Ali rolls her eyes. 
LATER, The Minister and the Cemetery worker walk away, leaving Ali and Loretta alone. 
LORETTA You were real good to her, Ali. 
ALI No, she was good to me. She rearranges the flowers resting on the plot, fixing it up. 
ALI (CONT'D) And she wasn't even my real Nanna. 
LORETTA What...? 
ALI Foster care. She took me in for the checks. When I turned eighteen, the money stopped coming. She could've kicked me out, but she didn't. 
(BEAT) 
(MORE) 
ALI (CONT'D) She had a lot of pain at the end. Nothing she talked about, but I could tell. 
LORETTA Well, then I guess this is a blessing. Now she's free. ON ALI, thinking realizing: 
ALI (talking about herself) Yeah. I guess she is. 
INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY 
Nanna's clothes - mostly flowered housedresses -- are folded in paper bags. Her belongings are stacked up in the corner. CLOSE ON ALI'S MATTRESS, as she pulls a WAD OF CASH out from under it. 
HEAR MUSIC OVER: "HONEY ROCK." 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT 
Nikki leads a GROUP OF GIRLS in a raucous routine to "HONEY ROCK". Very Moulin Rouge. 
BURLESQUE GIRLS 
HONEY::: In the wings, Tess watches with Sean. 
TESS Girls look good tonight. 
SEAN Amazing what a pink spotlight can do. Hides more cellulite than a burka. 
BURLESQUE GIRLS 
GO, HONEY, GO!..' 
INT. ALI'S TRAILER - DAY 
MOVE IN ON ALI, as she counts the money. Shit. Not enough. Then she looks around the trailer and realizes - tough shit. Stuffs the money in a pocket, then pulls out a suitcase. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT 
The Burlesque Girls tease the crowd. 
INT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - GRUNDY, IOWA - DAY 
Ali is at the ticket counter. 
ALI How much to Los Angeles? 
TICKET BOOTH GUY One way or round-trip? 
ALI You're kidding, right? 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC 
Cabaret chairs as they DROP FROM THE CEILING. The girls CATCH them, SPIN them around, SLAM them down and LAND ON THEM 
IN VARIOUS LAYOUTS. IN THE WINGS, Tess hands Sean her corset as she slips into a slinky dress. He takes her cigarette holder and grips it between his teeth as he zips her in. 
SEAN They're loving you tonight. 
TESS They're loving you. 
SEAN Oh, shucks, I just tell myself I'm writing for a big old drag queen. 
TESS Eat me. As he heads off with her discarded costume: 
SEAN A big old foul-mouthed drag queen! Tess looks in a mirror. As she makes the necessary adjustments, VINCE SCALI appears. 35, scruffy-handsome. 
VINCE Good show tonight. She glances up, sees him. Gets icy. Goes back to primping. 
VINCE (CONT'D) Too bad the club's half-empty. 
TESS Half-full. 
VINCE I got another call from Marcus Gerber. 
TESS And you told him we weren't selling. 
VINCE He wants to raise his offer. I told him we'd hear him out. Tess spins around, looking him in the eye for the first time. 
TESS Vince, I don't care what the number is; the only way Marcus Gerber will get this club from me is by prying it out of my cold, dead, heavily- jeweled fingers. She pivots away and sweeps into the club. 
BURLESQUE GIRLS 
OH, HONEY!!. Big finish, the number on stage ends. 
INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT 
Ali's on the bus, in a seat by herself. A LITTLE GIRL in front of her is peering over the chair, watching Ali. Ali smiles at her. The Little Girl's mother notices, gets the girl to sit down by tickling her. Ali unzips the pocket on her suitcase, takes out the FRAMED PHOTO of the mom and girl, looks at it. Then she looks out the window and watches America fly by as DAY TURNS TO NIGHT. 
EXT. CITY FREEWAY - DAY - THE BUS - SPEEDING BY 
Over which we HEAR someone channel surfing radio static-- 
INT. BUS - SAME 
Ali sits with her radio headset, searching stations as... 
RADIO 102.7 KIIS FM. Broadcasting from Hollywood and Vine... Ali perks up-- looks out the window as the bus rounds a bend and... THE HOLLYWOOD SIGN comes into view. NEW MUSIC UP: 
EXT. STREET - HOLLYWOOD BLVD. DAY - CARRY MUSIC 
The rush of tourists and traffic. Through a sea of people moving down the crowded sidewalk we FIND ALI as she emerges through the crowd, carrying her bags. Looking around at this exciting city. She SPOTS a SHITTY HOTEL with a sign: "$49.00 a night." She looks up at it. Then heads across the street-- 
INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
Cramped, dingy carpet, chipped paint. Key in the door. The MIDDLE-EASTERN HOTEL MANAGER -- 40's -- leads Ali in, pointing out the features of the room, speaking fast in an impossibly thick Kurdish accent. Ali nods along, not understanding a word. When he stops: 
ALI Okay! 
(THEN) Well. Good luck with that. He drops her suitcase on the bed and stands there. Waiting. 
ALI (CONT'D) Oh, hang on. She digs into her purse. All she has is twenties. She peels one off and holds it out. 
ALI (CONT'D) If I could just get a little -- But before she can finish, he pockets it, nods and leaves, closing the door behind him. To the closed door: 
ALI (CONT'D) -- change. She pulls open the blinds, they fall off the wall with a CRASH! Ali stares at them. Then she opens the window. The SOUNDS OF HOLLYWOOD pour in. She digs out her cash, sticks it under the mattress. Then she reconsiders. 
She removes the money, takes a Ziploc bag full of make-up from her purse, dumps the make-up onto the bed, seals the money up in the Ziploc, and takes it into: THE BATHROOM. She lifts the lid of the back toilet tank and slips the Ziploc of cash under it, catching the bag in the lid as she sets it back down, so it won't fall in. She goes back into the main room to find a CALICO CAT sitting on the window sill. It MEOWS, hops into the room. 
ALI (CONT'D) Hey. I thought this was a single. The cat curls up next to her. She checks his junk. 
ALI (CONT'D) Typical. First guy I meet is neutered. 
(THEN) You don't happen to know anyone in the music business, do you? 
CLOSE ON "BACKSTAGE WEST" MAGAZINE, Ali sips coffee from a paper cup as she reads TRADES and WANT ADS spread over the floor. She refills the lid of the cup, which the cat laps up. 
ALI (CONT'D) Singer/Actress... Singer/Songwriter .Singer/Scuba diver? Perfect. ON ANOTHER AD: It says: "SINGER/WAITRESS WANTED." MUSIC UP: 
EXT. THEME RESTAURANT - DAY 
TESS Smoother than honey and twice as sweet. Each girl lovelier then the next. Gentlemen, hold onto your hats. Ladies, hold on to your gentlemen. We may not have windows.. .but we DO have the best view on the Sunset Strip! MUSIC KICKS IN AS LIGHTS FLARE from the back of the stage, where Three Girls stand, backs to the audience, Fosse-style. Coco, Georgia, and Nikki strut downstage. Behind them, Girls MOVE AND DANCE on cabaret chairs. Totally raunchy, completely timeless. 
The girls hit the beats, turning upside-down on cabaret chairs, arched backs, legs reaching upward, bending over, asses to the audience, bodies writhing in air-tight choreography: thrusting hips, whipping heads, stomping feet. Ali watches, exhilarated, as the music builds and SWELLS to a full on performance with the entire ensemble-- 
JACK Get you a drink? She turns. A bartender is watching her watch. JACK - 25, punky, dark hair, eyeliner, one arm half-sleeved with tats. 
ALI Only if you're buying. 
JACK (slides her a beer) Welcome to L.A. 
ALI 
(DISAPPOINTED) Is it that obvious? 
JACK You still have that new-car smell. 
ALI Not brand new. But still under warranty. 
JACK Where you from? She looks back at the stage, mesmerized. 
ALI Iowa. 
JACK Oh, yeah? Kentucky. We're practically related. 
ALI I thought you looked familiar. He smiles. As Ali sips her free beer, Jack stacks drinks on a tray for a DITSY WAITRESS. He slides the tray to her. She doesn't notice. He barks at her: 
JACK Hey_. Go. 
The Waitress picks up the tray -- almost spilling the drinks - - then heads off. Ali looks around the place-- wowed... 
ALI 
(TO HERSELF) Damn... 
JACK They don't build 'em like this in Iowa, huh? 
ALI Hell no. I wouldn't have left. She stares up at the stage, marvels at the dancers. 
ALI (CONT'D) So tell me -- who does a girl flirt with to get from here... (points to the stage) to there? 
JACK Is this you flirting? 
ALI With someone wearing more eyeliner than me? He laughs. Points across the club to A DOOR leading backstage. 
JACK Ask for Tess. She's your guy. Flirt away. As she heads off-- 
JACK (CONT'D) Hey, Iowa-- use my name. He hands her a card. She looks at it: 
ALI Thanks, Jack. She smiles, slips it in her cleavage and heads for the door. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS 
Ali enters into a frenzy. Legs, costumes, boobs, heels, eyeliners -- all flying around like a flock of birds. 
In the middle of the maelstrom sits Tess, at a mirror, quietly applying lipstick. 
ALI Excuse me. I'm looking for Tess. 
TESS (glued to the mirror) So am I. And sometimes, when the lights are dim, and I squint my eyes ...I can still see her. She switches to mascara. Sean, arms heavy with corsets, catches eyes with Ali, nods toward Tess: "that's her." Ali steps closer to Tess. 
ALI Hi. I'm a friend of Jack's, and I'm- 
TESS New in town. 
ALI Yes, and I'm-- 
TESS Looking for a job. 
ALI Yes, and I-- 
TESS Want to perform here. 
ALI Yes. Tess glances at Ali in the mirror. Then goes back to her mascara, unimpressed. Silence. 
ALI (CONT'D) I'm a singer. A good one. 
TESS This is a dance show. 
ALI I can dance. 
TESS (a quick glance) Really? You a professional? 
ALI I'm a quick study. 
TESS Not on my dime. Tess stands, a final check in the mirror. Ali sees her chance 
SLIPPING AWAY-- 
ALI Okay, I get that you're busy so I won't waste any more of your time-- but this place-- I've just never seen anything like it before and I know I belong here. So, how can I be a part of it? 
I GOT A DENTIST, HE'S OVER SEVEN FEET TALL. 
HIS NAME IS DR. LONG JOHN, 
AND HE ANSWERS EVERY CALL. 
I WENT TO LONG JOHN'S OFFICE, 
I SAID, "DOCTOR, THE PAIN IS KILLIN' ME." 
HE SAID, DON'T WORRY BABY, 
IT'S JUST YOUR CAVITY, NEEDS A LITTLE FILLIN'.. . As she continues... ON THE FLOOR, Nikki is sitting in Marcus's lap, nibbling his neck. Vince sits down beside Marcus. Marcus pats Nikki on the butt, excusing her. As she heads off: 
VINCE She's on the verge. 
MARCUS That's what you said last time. 
VINCE She has no choice. We owe a balloon payment of 100 grand on the first, she took out a second to buy me out of the condo. And she just got turned down for another loan today. 
MARCUS There's a handful of these clubs around town, I could buy one of them tomorrow. 
VINCE But it wouldn't be in the heart of the Sunset Strip. 
ON STAGE TESS AND THE GIRLS TOYING WITH THE AUDIENCE... 
TESS 
.HE TOOK OUT HIS TRUSTY DRILL, 
TOLD ME TO OPEN WIDE. 
HE SAID HE WOULDN'T HURT ME, 
THEN HE FILLED MY HOLE INSIDE. 
LONG JOHN, DON ' T YOU EVER GO AWAY. 
CAUSE YOU THRILL ME WHEN YOU DRILL ME, 
AND I DON'T NEED NO NOVOCAINE TODAY. 
HE SAID IF IT EVER STARTS A'THROBBIN', 
COME BACK AND SEE OL' LONG JOHN, 
AGAIN, AND AGAIN, AND AGAIN AND AGAIN:1: A RIM-SHOT and BLAST from the band as the audience laughs. From the stage, Tess notices Vince shake Marcus's hand and leave. A flicker of irritation-- nothing anyone in the audience would notice -- but it's there. 
AT THE BAR, Ali brings a tray of empties over. Sean is there. 
ALI She's funny. 
SEAN Thanks. My lines. Our secret. Jack gives Sean his drink. He walks off. MUSIC UP: An insanely cool version of Sly and Family Stone "Everybody Is A Star" mashed up with a Fosse-esque Burlesque rap. 
Jack notices Ali watching the stage... she lights up and melts, enraptured by the girls as they vamp to choreography in a tight group. 
BURLESQUE GIRLS 
(WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE)... Song CONTINUES over a SERIES OF SHOTS: IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali plops down a bunch of BOOKS, OPENS The Golden Age of Burlesque", lays on her bed, petting her cat with her foot. She locks in on a photo of 20's-era Burlesque dancers over which we HEAR-- 
SLY AND FAMILY STONE 
EVERYBODY IS A STAR ... IN THE CLUB, BURLESQUE GIRLS strike a similar pose 
BURLESQUE GIRLS 
(WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE) 
ALI CHANNELING THE CHOREOGRAPHY AS SHE: - wipes down tables with Jack in the club after hours, - flips through old Soul records at a used LP store, - pokes her way through the scruffy street folks that hang out by her hotel. 
IN THE CLUB 
BURLESQUE GIRLS (CONT'D) 
(WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE) ON ALI'S BED, Ali flips to a picture of Mae West IN THE CLUB, Tess cracks up the crowd 
BURLESQUE GIRLS (CONT'D) 
(WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE) IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali eats Chinese take-out as she pores over the book. Turns the page to a photo of OLD SCHOOL ACROBATS over "Everybody Is A Star"... IN THE CLUB, Daredevils Missy and Kitten DeVille nail an 
AERIAL MOVE 
BURLESQUE GIRLS (CONT'D) 
(WHISPER RAP A'LA FOSSE) 
IN ALI'S HOTEL ROOM, Ali, in the bath, still reading, turns the page to a gorgeous image of Josephine Baker 
SLY AND FAMILY STONE 
ALI I had to pee. Is that okay with you? 
COCO Not when you're blocking my mirror it's not. Ali sees she's in the way. As she steps aside: 
COCO (CONT'D) (re. the music) That's us. You okay, or are you gonna puke on me during the number? 
GEORGIA I can't make any promises. Coco drags her out, leaving Ali alone. Ali looks at herself in the mirror. Reaches into her shirt and does the boob-hoist that Georgia did. Looks again. Better. 
INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Ali trudges up the stairs, tired. Suddenly, TWO YOUNG THUGS barrel down the stairs, past her, almost knocking her over. 
ALI Hey! They tear past her. She shakes her head, reaches her landing, heads down the hall toward her room, then sees: HER HOTEL ROOM DOOR, ajar. The lock broken. 
ALI (CONT'D) No. No! She runs down the hall. 
INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Ransacked. Ali rushes in, goes straight into: 
INT. ALI'S HOLLYWOOD ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The lid is off the toilet tank. Her Ziploc of money is gone. 
ALI No!!! God damn it!!! She looks out the window, SEES the ROBBERS running off, disappearing down the street. She kicks the trash can. It flies across the room. 
ALI (CONT'D) Damn it! Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it! She sees the cat watching her from behind the bed. 
ALI (CONT'D) A lotta help you were. The cat creeps out, slinks around her legs. Ali plunks on the bed. 
ALI (CONT'D) Shit. Then she sees, on the floor, the PHOTO she took from Nanna's. She picks it up. The glass has cracked, tearing the picture. 
She takes the picture out of the broken frame, smooths it out -- then looks around her trashed room. Fighting despair. 
EXT. WEST HOLLYWOOD STREET - NIGHT 
FOLLOW a motorcycle up the street. The DRIVER has a KEYBOARD on his back. He parks, gets off, takes off his helmet. It's Jack. He heads for his apartment, but slows when he sees: ALI, sitting on his steps, her bags at her feet. Head low. 
JACK Ali? What's wrong? You okay? She tries to speak, but can't -- so she just nods. 
JACK (CONT'D) Really? Cause, in my experience-- when you're on someone's doorstep surrounded by everything you own, there's usually a not-so-good story 
THAT-- 
ALI 
I-- WAS-- And as she expected, as soon as she talks, she starts to cry. 
ALI (CONT'D) 
--RO-0-0-0-OBBED. 
JACK Shit. No way! 
ALI (halting, gaspy sobs) Came in -- busted the lock-- and stole all my MO-NEY-EY-EY-EY!!! She sobs--trying to talk, with high-pitched SQUEAKS only heard by birds. Jack winces, trying to follow-- 
ALI (CONT'D) (more gaspy sobs) And there's no way I-- sleep there-- with-- like that-- the manager said- - not till Monday-- and I don't-- anyone else-- but then-- so I remembered I had...but it went straight to...so I... She reaches in her pocket, pulls out a card. It's Jack's that he gave her in the club. It has his address on it. 
JACK Okay. I have no idea what you just said, but come on in here and we'll get it sorted out. She looks at him. Wiping her tears. He picks up the heaviest of her bags and leads her to: 
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Tiny one-bedroom. Very "done." Floral sofa. Curtains that match the area rug. Candle groupings. 
JACK Have a seat. I'll get us BOTH a drink. Here -- He hands her his phone. She looks at it. 
JACK (CONT'D) -- call whoever you want, long- distance, whatever-- 
ALI I can't. 
JACK Sure you can. Go ahead. Her chin starts quivering all over again. 
ALI I.. .don't ...have anyone. 
JACK What do you mean? 
ALI To call. 
JACK No parents? (she shakes her head) Siblings? Aunts? Uncles? 
(NO AGAIN) Friends? 
ALI 
(THROUGH TEARS) No one! No one, okay? Do I have to spell it out for you? I am -- completely -- alone! 
Jack susses out the situation. 
JACK 
ALI Fiancee? You're straight? 
JACK Of course I'm straight. You thought I was gay? 
ALI Yes? 
JACK Why? 
ALI I don't know, the...make-up? 
JACK It's a look. 
ALI Okay. 
JACK A straight look. 
ALI Okay. 
(THEN) And the floral couch...? 
ALI/JACK Natalie. As Ali realizes she's barely dressed in front of a straight guy. 
ALI I should put on pants. 
JACK Probably. She bolts out to the living room, starts digging through her bag, bent over. She's in the doorway, so from the kitchen, all he can see is her cute little ass sticking out. 
ALI Where is she? 
JACK New York. Doing a play. 
ALI For how long? 
JACK Six more weeks. She can't find pants. She shifts, so now her ass is facing him directly. He tries not to look-- 
ALI 
(KEEPS DIGGING) Oh, God, now I feel bad about this. 
I'M SORRY-- 
JACK For what? 
ALI I don't know. Now that you're straight and engaged, it feels weird that I came here. 
JACK Well, you did, and it was fine. Aha! Pants. She pulls them out, starts putting them on. He looks out. Her foot is caught in the pants leg. As she hops around, trying to untangle it-- 
JACK (CONT'D) Or at least it will be as soon as you get dressed. She tumbles out of view, thumps against some furniture. She appears in the doorway, pants on, pulling on a sweater. She slips her feet into her shoes. 
ALI Alrighty then-- I'll get outta your hair now... 
JACK Wait, where're you headed? 
ALI Oh, don't worry about me. I've got a plan. (scoops up the cat) Come on, cat. She zips the cat into the bag he came in. 
JACK Hang on, let me at least spot you some cash. I'm a little strapped, but I could -- 
ALI No, I'm good, if you could just She nods at the door. He opens it for her. 
ALI (CONT'D) Thank you. For everything. You are my knight in shining... eyeliner. 
(MORE) 
ALI (CONT'D) (out the door) I'll see you at the club. 
JACK Cool. She leaves. He closes the door behind her. Stands there. 
EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Ali looks at the rain. Then marches out into it, lugging her stuff. Goes about 15 yards in one direction, then stops. 
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - SAME 
Jack watches her out the window as she marches 15 yards in another direction, then stops. Pondering. She sees a bus stop across the street. She crosses to it and sits. 
EXT. BUS STOP - DAY 
Ali peers down the street for the bus. Jack appears beside her, getting soaked in the rain. 
JACK So, this plan of yours? 
ALI .was to sit here at the bus stop and come up with a plan. 
JACK Come back inside. 
ALI No, Jack, I-- 
JACK 
ALI-- 
ALI (CONT'D) I may not have been to a professional dance school, but I have a lot of talent and I came to this town to do something with it. And the only reason I've been putting up with all the bullshit "attitude" I get from you is cause I want to do it here. 
(BEAT) For the first time in my life, I don't want to be someplace else. So you're gonna give me MY shot. Right here. Right now. Everyone in the club just stands there. Jaws dropped. Tess just looks at her, blinks, incredulous. 
ALI (CONT'D) One song. You don't like it, I'll quit and do us both a favor. 
(BEAT) Your call, lady. I know every number in the show. Sean, eyes big as saucers, looks from Ali to Tess, then back 
AGAIN-- 
TESS 
(DOUBTFUL) You know every number. 
ALI Which one do you wanna see? Tess looks at her in disbelief. 
ALI (CONT'D) I said, which one do you wanna see? Ali just stares at her. Calling her bluff, Tess yells up to DAVE in the sound booth-- 
TESS Tough Lover! Tess plops down in a booth-- crosses her arms indignantly. ON STAGE, the music starts. Ali readies herself, starts to dance. Behind a beat to two. She's got the steps right, but it isn't clicking. She's thinking too hard. No personality. After a few measures, Tess has seen enough. 
TESS (CONT'D) Okay then, next? 
ALI Hang on. (to Dave in the booth) Start it again, please? As Dave resets the music. Ali regroups: takes her hair down and shakes it loose. Nikki ENTERS, SEES Ali on stage-- 
NIKKI 
(TO GEORGIA) What the hell's going on? 
COCO Shhhh. On stage, Ali takes a beat; inhales, breathing in attitude. Then she looks up at the booth again. 
ALI Anytime. The MUSIC starts in again. And this time, Ali comes alive. She may not have perfect technique or the best extension, but she exudes an ambition and sexuality no one has seen from her before. It's like she becomes a woman before our eyes. She misses a step or two, but who the hell cares? On the floor, Sean gapes, eyes popping. Tess is poker-faced. Coco and Georgia's expressions turn from dubious to respectful. Nikki's eyes narrow. At the bar, Jack freezes, a huge rack of glasses in his arms - - unable to tear his eyes away. 
As the SONG CLIMAXES, Ali finishes with an alluring toss of her ass, then lands in a sexy layout on a chair, owning the stage. The music ends. A stunned silence. The only sound is Ali's heavy breathing. Then Georgia jumps up, APPLAUDING EFFUSIVELY. 
NIKKI What are so you happy about, that's your replacement. 
GEORGIA Yeah, but she's really good. Tess and Ali are in a stare down. 
TESS I want so badly to say something bitchy, but nothing's coming. 
SEAN There's a first. Tess sighs, not wanting to give Ali any props. 
TESS You were off the whole second half. 
ALI So, I was spot on the first half? Tess narrows her eyes at Ali. Then looks over at Nikki, Coco and Georgia. Georgia gives an effusive THUMBS UP-- then suddenly becomes overcome by nausea, covers her mouth and RUNS to the bathroom to puke-- Tess rolls her eyes, looks back at Ali. 
TESS Oh, you're gonna be such a pain in my ass. Ali tries hard not to beam-- 
ALI Do I have the job, or not? 
TESS You're not great. What you are is lucky. Because I need someone tonight. 
ALI And I know all the routines. As Tess turns and leaves-- 
TESS Even in those shoes that time forgot. 
SEAN Theeeere's bitchy. Nikki watches Tess go-- turns and pours herself a shot. 
NIKKI Well-- this totally sucks ass. Sean jumps up on the stage. 
SEAN Congratulations. The last time someone showed Tess balls like that, she married him. (looks Ali over) You look like a checker at a Mal Wart in Wichita. Just tripled your salary. Get a new look. 
ALI Hey, I happen to like the way I look. 
SEAN Really? That's a fascinating story. And then what happens? 
(ALL BUSINESS) Backstage in five. 
(WALKING OFF) Welcome to the family. Ali jumps off the stage, runs to the bar, where Jack is still standing, slack-jawed. She throws her arms around him. 
ALI Sorry for the short notice, I quit! (plants a big kiss on him) But hey-- with my raise I'll be off your couch in a week. She squeezes him tight-- then heads backstage leaving him standing there, really turned on. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - DAY 
Sean swings open A DOOR, revealing a room packed to the gills with costumes: feathers, sequins, fishnets, corsets, jammed up against each other. Sean tosses her clothes in a blur. 
SEAN First number, second number, third number... She catches the clothes. He dumps shoes on top of them, holding them up as he tells her what they go with: 
SEAN (CONT'D) With the sequined bustier. With the shorts and garters. With the beaded number. And those -- (points to hers) I never want to see again. 
(REMEMBERING) Oh! And -- He hands her a prop GOLD MACHINE GUN. 
SEAN (CONT'D) For "Miss Otis Regrets". Just be sure you don't -- Ali pulls the trigger. BOOM -- GLITTER SPLATS all over Sean. 
SEAN (CONT'D) Pull the trigger. 
MUSIC UP: "RICH MAN'S FRUG". CARRY MUSIC OVER: 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT 
JACK (CONT'D) I'm gonna suck it up and let you stay here a little longer. Just throw in a little something for rent. She looks at him, curious. 
ALI What about the "God damn" cat? 
JACK Hey, I don't like the cat. And I don't like my towel being wet. I don't like the lack of privacy. But you're in a jam -- and I'm the kind of guy, if a friend's in trouble, I help. It's just who I am. 
ALI 
(SUSPICIOUS) What did Natalie have to say? 
JACK Nothing, you know just... hi. She narrows her eyes at him. He concedes. 
JACK (CONT'D) And...her play got extended three more months, so since she has to pay rent there, she can't also keep up her part of the rent here. 
ALI Ah-hah. 
JACK So if you could stick around and chip in, it would -- 
ALI Save your ass? 
JACK -- help. Ali looks down at his shoes. 
ALI Well, will you look at that? The shoe, on the other foot! 
JACK 
OKAY -- 
ALI One minute I'm a freeloader with a God damn cat, the next, I'm the only thing standing between you and 
EVICTION -- 
JACK Just -- yes or no? 
ALI What's the proposal, exactly? Jack looks at her-- realizes he's screwed. 
JACK The bedroom, with private bathroom access, for 600 a month, including utilities. 
ALI Closet? 
JACK Half . Ali picks up the paper, reads an ad. 
ALI Ooh, look! Hot tub! 
JACK Fine. The closet, too. She weighs it. Makes him suffer. Then: 
ALI Okay. 
JACK Thank you. 
ALI 
(MOCKING HIM) Hey, I'm the kind of girl, if a friend's in trouble, I help. That's just who I am. We HEAR an AUDIENCE laugh O.S. as we... 
EXT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT 
Small crowd outside. 
TESS (O.S.) So I said to the sailor, I may not be as good as I once was... 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT 
Through a transparent scrim, the Puccini Triplets perform a sexy harem scene in silhouette, casting larger than life shadows-- Tess walks behind the scrim playfully, in and out of view. The Bumber Band plays off to the side. 
TESS But you can bet your sweet ass I'm better ONCE than I ever was... The crowd laughs. Tess points to a woman who isn't laughing. 
TESS (CONT'D) Drink up, sister! You're a tad behind. (to a waiter, re: woman) Be a dear and bring Mommy over there another scotch. The crowd chuckles as the Bumper Band kicks in and the harem scene evolves into a sexy tongue-in-cheek silhouetted dance. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 
Tess comes off stage. Sean bustles up to her. 
SEAN The distributor's holding back the booze unless we cut him a check. 
TESS Ply him with drinks, send Scarlett over to flirt, and try to finagle him down to a half. 
SEAN How's a third? He produces a check, all filled-out, for her to sign. 
TESS Have I told you lately that I love you? 
SEAN Got any brothers? 
He bustles off with the check. Scarlett, Coco and Nikki approach the stage wearing leather, strappy Gaultier corsets with gloves and fishnets --post-modern Germanesque -- Nikki is carrying a glass of tequila. Tess eyeballs her-- 
TESS Drinking already? 
NIKKI Yes, Mommie. 
TESS You're drunk. 
Tess looks at Ali, you could knock her over with a feather. Sean looks at Tess. Scarlett looks at Coco. Jack stares at the stage. Everyone stunned by the sound coming out of this girl. And now the song really takes off! SUDDENLY, one of the BAND BOYS grabs his sax and plays. Ali jumps in, seamless, as the guys on Bass and Drums join in. Ali picks up the choreography. The girls fall in with her. 
ALI (CONT'D) 
I WANT A TOUGH LOVER, YEAH, YEAH. I 
NEED A TOUGH LOVER. WHOOO. I WANT A 
TOUGH LOVER. YEAH-YEAH. TOUGH 
LOVER. UH-HA... Coco and Scarlett chime in on back-up. Hearing them, Jessie and Anna join in as well. Ali takes off, holding nothing back. The girls feed off her confidence, and soon all of them are hitting the backs of their cabaret chairs, stomping their feet to the music. The girls singing back-up. In his seat, Marcus sits up a little straighter -- suddenly paying more attention. Unable to take his eyes off Ali. The BAND plays along. The BARTENDERS accompany them with hand-claps. All except Jack, who's too spellbound to move. 
ALI (CONT'D) 
WHEN HE KISSES ME I'LL GET A THRILL 
AND WHEN HE DO THAT WIGGLE, I WON ' T 
KEEP STILL ... ON THE FLOOR, Nikki watches, aghast, as the crowd engages like we've never seen them. 
ALI/GIRLS 
I WANT A TOUGH LOVER, YEAH, YEAH. I 
NEED A TOUGH LOVER. WHOOO. I WANT A 
TOUGH LOVER. YEAH-YEAH. 
BARTENDERS/GIRLS 
TOUGH LOVER. UH-HA... The girls come alive, finally able to sing a song they've been faking for so long

ALI/GIRLS 
I WANT A TOUGH LOVER, YEAH, YEAH. I 
NEED A TOUGH LOVER. WHOOO. I WANT A 
TOUGH LOVER. YEAH-YEAH. 
BARTENDERS/GIRLS 
TOUGH LOVER. UH-HA::! The room ERUPTS IN APPLAUSE, knowing they caught a once-in-a- lifetime performance. Marcus stands, clapping, whistling. Ali basks in it, jubilant, rapturous. She glances to the wings and sees Sean, clapping and jumping in place. Then she sees Tess beside him, stone-faced. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 
The Girls exit the stage in a flurry, everyone congratulating Ali -- a whirlwind of hugs, kisses. Ali reaches Tess. 
ALI Tess, when the music stopped-- 
TESS DAVE Why didn't you tell me you I have no idea what happened. could blow like that? 
ALI (CONT'D) I did. Tess spots a TATTOOED BAND GUY in the door. 
TESS Do you boys know all the music? 
TATTOOED BAND GUY Hell, yeah. Nikki wanders in, drink in hand. Tess looks at them all. Plants her hands on her hips.

WHAT?. I AM A GOOD GIRL. Ali finishes the song to big applause. Takes her bow. Makes her way off the stage and ACROSS the club to... JACK AT THE BAR - he turns to see Ali. 
ALI (CONT'D) Hiya, big boy. She spins herself around on a bar stool, so he can see all angles. Jack likes plenty. Way too much. 
ALI (CONT'D) What do you think? 
JACK 
(FLUSTERED) It's...I think-you look...I mean, yeah... do you like it? Not the reaction she was looking for. 
ALI Jack. It's okay for you to think I look hot. We're friends for chrissakes. It's not like we're brother and sister. 
She rolls her eyes, gets up, and heads backstage. Jack watches her go-- 
JACK 
(TO HIMSELF) No. We certainly are not. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 
The Burlesque Girls are prepping for the show. 
NIKKI Why the hell is everyone having a conniption over her? She's just a tacky, pushy girl from a -- Ali -- sexy, sophisticated, gorgeous -- enters. 
NIKKI (CONT'D) -- fly-over state. Ali pretends she didn't hear. She sits at her mirror. The girls stare at her, mouths agape. Ali picks up her mascara wand, looks down the mirror at Nikki's reflection. 
ALI 
(FAUX INNOCENT) What's a fly-over state? Ali takes a deft stroke of her wand over her lashes, then bats them at Nikki. Nikki walks out. Coco smiles with appreciation. Whistles long and low. The girls all laugh. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - NIGHT 
Tess glad-hands guests, then spots Vince, waving at her. She starts over, then sees Marcus in the booth with Vince. She turns and walks the other way. Vince catches up to her. 
VINCE 
TESS -- 
TESS Vince, if I were going to sell, I'd have sold to those idiots building that monstrosity across the street. I said no. 
VINCE Which made Marcus bump his offer up again. It's obscene, what he wants to give us. At least hear him out. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - TESS'S CLUTTERED OFFICE - NIGHT 
Tess, at her desk, reads a contract. Marcus and Vince sit across from her, watching. 
MARCUS It's very simple. I buy you out and pay you a million off the top. (motions to Vince) Five hundred grand each. Tess looks up from the contract, squints at Marcus. 
TESS Why do you want this club so badly? 
MARCUS Best view on the Sunset Strip. 
VINCE Do you know what you could do with that money, Tess? 
TESS Do you know what you can do with that money, Vince? 
VINCE Be reasonable. We're rolling vendors ninety days out. 
MARCUS The club's not even worth what you paid for it. You've got a second mortgage, you can't get a third. Tess looks at Vince, betrayed. 
TAKES HIS TIME... 
THE SONG CONTINUES OVER: - INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - Ali lies on her stomach on the floor perusing a Fashion Magazine. Across the room, Jack sits on the couch, PLAYING HIS KEYBOARD--UNDERSCORING THE SONG. He looks at Ali. Watching her. Without looking up, she takes a pencil, gathers her hair, and puts it up expertly. A few strands fall back onto her neck. Sexy. Ali feels his stare. Looks up at him. Smiles. He smiles back. She goes back to her magazine. ON JACK. Loving that she's there. - INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - DRESSING ROOM - Ali, the Girls and Sean getting ready. Georgia bursts into the room, showing off an ENGAGEMENT RING. Everyone jumps up, congratulates her. - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - The GIRLS and Ali vamp, singing: 
ALI (CONT'D) 
A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME, I'D GO 
FOR ANYTIME. A HASTY JOB REALLY 
SPOILS A MASTER'S TOUCH ... AT THE BAR, Jack watches as he pours drinks. - EXT. STREET. AFTERNOON - Ali on the back of Jack's motorcycle, puts her arms around his waist. Jack revs the engine. Weaving through traffic on the Strip. The wind in their hair. Her scarf tears away, lifting into the air... - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - Ali and Burlesque girls continue... 
ALI (CONT'D) 
I DON'T LIKE A BIG COMMOTION, I'M A 
DEMON FOR SLOW MOTION OR SUCH. WHY 
SHOULD I DENY, THAT I WOULD DIE, TO 
KNOW A GUY WHAT TAKES HIS TIME ... - INT. JACK'S LIVING ROOM - Ali, Sean, Tess, Scarlett, Anna, Georgia, DAMON (her fiance), hanging out in the living room, decorated with party gear. The lights dim and Jack and Coco enter with a birthday cake. They set it in front of Ali. Ali looks around at her friends, drinking it in. She locks eyes with Jack -- then closes her eyes and BLOWS. - INT. BURLESQUE STAGE - Ali, still singing her song. 
ALI (CONT'D) 
I CAN SPOT AN AMATEUR, APPRECIATE A 
CONNOISSEUR IN HIS TRADE, WHO WOULD 
QUALIFY, NO ALIBI, TO BE THE GUY, 
WHO TAKES HIS TIME... PULL BACK to reveal A PACKED HOUSE. The audience goes nuts. Marcus is at his table, clapping, whistling, her biggest fan. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - AT THE BAR - LATER 
Ali walks up to the bar. 
ALI Hey -- when can you cut out? I'm about to fall asleep standing up. 
JACK I have that gig, remember? In fact, I gotta head out or I'm gonna be late. (checking his watch) I can maybe swing you home before. 
ALI No, that's okay, you go. I'll grab a ride with Coco. He grabs his jacket from under the bar. As he heads out: 
JACK By the way -- you killed. 
ALI (looks at him, smiles) Thanks. 
He disappears out the back exit. Ali turns around and finds herself face to face with Marcus. 
MARCUS You ready? 
ALI For what? 
MARCUS I'll drop you off. 
(BEAT) Coco left five minutes ago. She realizes he was listening to her conversation. 
ALI Excuse me? 
MARCUS Sorry-- I was coming to talk to you and caught the end of your conversation. 
ALI (putting on her coat reaching for her bags) Talk to me about...? 
MARCUS Dinner. With me. Gimmie that. He swoops down and GRABS her dance bag and purse, turns and heads out. 
MARCUS (CONT'D) 
(WALKING AWAY) If you ever expect to see this bag alive again... you'll come with me. 
ALI Hey...! Come back here...! 
INT. MARCUS'S BENTLEY - NIGHT 
ON Ali, looking out the window with her arms crossed. WIDEN to REVEAL, she's in car with Marcus, zipping along Sunset. 
ALI Where are you taking me? 
MARCUS I told you-- to dinner. 
ALI Dinner? What about Nikki-- What's up with you and Nikki? 
MARCUS We're friends. 
ALI Where I'm from friends don't chew each other's earlobes. 
MARCUS Aren't you glad you left? (then, remembering) Oh, damn! 
ALI What? 
MARCUS I just remembered I have to make a quick appearance at a party. 
ALI You own...air? 
MARCUS Air rights. The guy who owns the strip mall was having money issues and almost had to sell. Whoever he sold to would have put in a huge tower. So I bought the air rights. Now no one can ever build above one story. 
ALI Aren't you the sly puss. 
MARCUS Mall guy gets to keep his property. I get to keep the second best view in L.A. 
ALI What's the first? He gazes at her. She rolls her eyes. 
ALI (CONT'D) How many girls have you used that on? 
MARCUS None who ever called me on it. He smiles. Looks at her. Then... 
MARCUS (CONT'D) What do you want, Ali? In life. Girl like you, gives up everything, gets on a bus heading for total uncertainty-- she's got a dream. I want to know what it is. 
ALI Why? 
MARCUS Because you're talented enough to get whatever you want. And I'm smart enough to help make it happen. So? What do you want? A beat. She thinks about it. Looks him in the eye. 
ALI I want to be the best singer I can be. I want to give as much joy as I get when I perform. And I want to die knowing I made the most of every opportunity life gave me. 
MARCUS That's ...so beautiful. 
AL I There wasn't a dry eye in the house when I said it at the Grundy County Junior Miss Talent Show. His eyes narrow. 
MARCUS Why do you women always take advantage of nice boys? 
ALI Oh, please. You are SO not a nice boy. He clinks her glass. Smiles at her. Devilish and sexy. 
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - WEE HOURS - NIGHT 
Party's over. Lights low. Ali walks through the almost- empty house, passes a COUPLE making out on a couch, a GUY who holds out a joint. She motions "no thanks", heads into the: LIVING ROOM, where Marcus is asleep on a Bertolli chair, drink in hand. An OLDER GUY is playing the piano quietly. Ali takes the drink from Marcus's hand, sets it on the table. She hears the pianist start a new song: (TBD). She smiles. Goes over to him. 
ALI Ooh, I love this song. The Piano Player scoots to make room. She sits beside him. He starts humming along. She does too. Then he sings a line. She sings one back. And they fall in together. Not vamping, not performing. Just feeling the beauty of the music in the middle of the night. 
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CARRY MUSIC 
Jack quietly lets himself in. He sets his keyboard down, then sees the bedroom door cracked, the light on. 
JACK Ali? He looks in. Empty. He checks the clock: 4:45. He hears a "meow", and sees the cat. He picks it up, turns out the light, and leaves the room. 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 
Sean, Coco, Nikki, Jesse, and the rest of the girls in early stages of getting ready. Ali enters. 
COCO Someone has a package! Ali sees A GIFT BOX at her station. She reads the card: "You saw them first." She opens the box and sees the Louboutins. 
JESSE Ooh. Faboo. Nikki picks one up -- checking their authenticity. 
NIKKI Who's the sucker? All eyes turn to Ali. She's saved by Tess entering. 
TESS Coco-puff, shake a leg, you're on in five, Georgie-Girl, Ali-Cat -- move, move, move -- Tess exits. 
ALI Ahh. My Nanna used to call me her Ali-Cat. 
SEAN Yet another fascinating story. 
NIKKI Why doesn't Tess have a nickname for me? 
COCO Oh, she does. A knowing look amongst the girls. 
NIKKI She never uses it. 
SEAN Sure she does. 
NIKKI When? 
SEAN Just after you leave the room. Nikki gives him the finger and walks out. A beat. Then: 
GIRLS TOGETHER Coke-whore. They crack up. CUE MUSIC: "STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING" 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT 
Ali and the Burlesque Girls vamp forward and perform "STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING", a decadent, rockin' dance/singing number. Scantily-clad girls pose and dance on chairs with images projected onto them -- a rock fantasy with burlesque moves (like Bob Fosse's "All That Jazz") 
ALI 
WELL I STAY OUT LATE AT NIGHT. I 
DON'T TREAT MY BABY RIGHT. THERE'S 
STRANGE THINGS HAPPENING EVERY 
DAY... 
MUSIC CONTINUES OVER: - INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - Jack, playing his keyboards. Ali comes in, wearing the Louboutins. 
JACK You were out late last night. 
JACK (trying to be serious) The dog, or Nanna? Ali bursts out laughing. So does Jack, as he pushes the door open, and they fall into the apartment. 
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Jack and Ali stumble in, Jack knocks the lamp over trying to turn on the light. It BREAKS. Ali giggles as she plops down on the couch, struggling to take off her leather boot. No luck. She holds her legs out. 
ALI Help me. Jack gets the lamp to standing, then grabs one of Ali's boots, slides it off, dumps it. Then he tries the second -- it sticks -- he pulls harder -- the boot pops off and he careens backwards, crashing into the lamp, knocking it over again. Ali cracks up. He turns to the lamp. 
JACK (like to a dog) Stay. He turns back to Ali, regains composure, bows 
JACK (CONT'D) Good night. He backs away, into the bedroom. Ali looks confused. 
ALI Oh. Okay. 
(BEAT) Good night. Jack disappears into the bedroom and closes the door. Ali stares at it, surprised. Then resigned. Oh, well. She undoes her bra, threads it through her top and out the arms. Then Jack's door opens. He stands in the doorway in matching "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" pajamas, leaning against the doorframe like Hugh Hefner in his finest silk smoking jacket. 
ALI (CONT'D) Cute jammies. 
JACK A gift from my mother. Never worn them. 
ALI Go figure. Jack walks past Ali, toward the door. 
JACK Forgot to lock up. 
(HE DOES) Okay. Night. 
ALI Night again. He walks back into the bedroom and once gain shuts the door. Ali smiles to herself, plumps her pillow. The door flies open again -- Jack's there in just the pants, no top. 
JACK Water. No hangover. He stumbles past Ali to the kitchen, drinks from the tap. After a moment he returns to the bedroom, nodding to Ali. 
JACK (CONT'D) Night. Ali just nods. He closes the door. Ali smiles, waiting. After a beat, the door opens again. Jack is there, in boxers. 
JACK (CONT'D) Hungry. He walks past her to the kitchen, opens a box of cereal, pours it into his mouth. Grabs some milk from the fridge, pours it into his mouth, too. Returns to the bedroom, crunching. He closes the door. Then -- very quickly -- he opens it again and walks out. 
JACK (CONT'D) I know I forgot something else, but I just can't remember what... 
(TO HIMSELF) Door locked, water, food... He wanders out into the room, past Ali, and we see from behind he is butt-ass naked. She cracks up. 
JACK (CONT'D) What's so funny? She covers her face. He glances down. 
JACK (CONT'D) Well I never! He strides back to the bedroom, shutting the door. After a moment, he comes back out dressed in an old, flowered bathrobe and fur-lined orange hunting cap. 
JACK (CONT'D) I remembered what I forgot to do. 
ALI What? 
JACK 
(SERIOUS) Kiss you goodnight. He crosses to her, takes her in his arms, and kisses her. She kisses back, making up for all their lost time. MUSIC UP: "PRISONER" a big, soulful ballad. 
PAN OFF THEM TO: 
INT. BURLESQUE LOUNGE - ON STAGE - NIGHT 
Ali steps into frame on stage, singing:

LOSE YOU. I 'LL NEVER BE BLUE 
OR BE ALL ALONE. JUST DON'T EVER 
LEAVE ME. SO MY HEART WON'T GRIEVE 
ME. AND OUR GOOD LOVIN

DOWN TO: 
JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY Jack and Ali in bed, in post-coital bliss. 
ALI (CONT'D) Well, it's official. 
JACK What?

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - DAY 
A PAIR OF WOMEN'S HEELS enter the apartment and pick their way over last night's discarded clothes and head for: 
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY 
Where Jack and Ali are sleeping, entwined. The heels stop at the base of the bed. A beat. Then, enraged: 
NATALIE 
I KNEW IT! Jack bolts up in bed. Stares. 
JACK Natalie! Ali blinks awake. Confused. 
ALI Natalie? Jack scrambles for something to put on. 
NATALIE YOU are a LIAR. You're a sneaky, pathetic LI-AR! 
ALI (quiet, to Jack) What 's she doing here: 
JACK I don't know! 
NATALIE I LIVE HERE, you bleached out tramp, what the hell are YOU doing here?!! 
ALI 
(TO JACK) You were engaged to this woman? 
JACK (finds his boxers) Nat, can we talk about this in the living room -- 
NATALIE I can't BELIEVE I bought your bullshit: "It's nothing, she's just this chick from work, she's nothing." 
(TO ALI) That's what he called you. "Nothing. She's not even pretty. (sizing Ali up) Well, at least you were honest about one thing-- 
ALI JACK You said that? No, I didn't -- 
NATALIE (CONT'D) JACK He most certainly did! Nat-- shut the fu-- 
ALI NATALIE Jack?!? Don't even say his name! As Ali grabs for a shirt-- 
JACK Listen, Ali-- let me just-- would you mind -- 
ALI What?!? 
JACK Giving us a little privacy? 
AL I 
(OFFENDED) You want me to leave? 
NATALIE Yes you! I'm the fiancee. You're a booty call. You go. 
JACK Natalie, Jesus, STOP IT! Ali grabs some pants from the floor, pulls them on. 
ALI Fine, I'm out of here-- (seething to Jack) You said you split up! 
NATALIE In one phone call? Please, you don't dump a girl like me on the phone. 
JACK Both of you-- STOP IT! As Ali quickly grabs a few things-- 
JACK (CONT'D) Ali-- I'm really sorry-- I-- 
ALI So am I. She gathers up more things, really pissed-- 
JACK Wait-- do you need money for a Motel or... Ali stifles him with an incredulous glare-- can't believe how this is going down. She looks at him, so incredibly hurt. Grabs her suitcase and brushes past him, stuffing her belongings into it. Jack goes after her-- 
JACK (CONT'D) Ali, wait a second-- don't-- (as the door SLAMS) --go. 
(BEAT) Shit. Jack looks at Natalie. She folds her arms. 
EXT. SEAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Ali knocks on a door, suitcase in hand. A beat. Then a good- looking guy, who's obviously just woken up, answers with a blanket wrapped around him. He is the DJ from the wedding. 
ALI Oh. I'm sorry. I think I have the wrong apartment. I'm looking for Sean? (off his blank look) Brown hair? 5'10n? Early 30's? 
DJ Oh, Sean! I thought he said John. He's asleep. Come in. 
The DJ shuffles inside. Ali follows as he leads her to the bedroom. He points to Sean in the bed. 
DJ (CONT'D) That him? Ali nods. Sean's eyes pop open, confused to see her. 
SEAN What are you doing here? 
ALI Long story. Sean notices the guy in the blanket. 
SEAN Ali, this is Mike. 
DJ Mark. 
JACK Is Ali here? 
MARK Just left. Mark continues down. Jack whips around, looks at him, then up at Sean, who nods. 
JACK Where'd she go? 
SEAN With Marcus. 
JACK What? 
SEAN I told you, opportunity doesn't knock forever. Jack burns, frustrated, then heads slowly down the stairs. Sean shakes his head and turns to go back inside. Then pauses, noticing: Mark, looking up at Sean's apartment, hesitating. Then he opens his car to get in. Sean stands there, realizing he's doing the same thing. He steps onto the stairwell. Calls out: 
SEAN (CONT'D) Hey! You! 
MARK 
(LOOKS UP) It's Mark. 
SEAN Mark. You wanna have breakfast? Off Mark's smile: 
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Ali follows Marcus through the kitchen, to the fridge. 
MARCUS My mother always said there's only one thing to do when you're feeling blue... He opens the fridge and pulls out a bottle of CHAMPAGNE. 
ALI She was a poet. 
MARCUS And a drunk. Ali smiles. Marcus pops the cork, fills two glasses, hands her one. Clinks. 
MARCUS (CONT'D) To your new place. 
ALI What new place? 
INT. MARCUS'S HOUSE - GUEST HOUSE - DAY 
A lavish, 1000-square-foot guest house. Marcus ushers Ali in. 
MARCUS All yours. (off her look) Unpack. Move in. 
ALI Marcus, I can't just-- 
MARCUS Sure you can. Marcus plops her suitcase on the bed. 
MARCUS (CONT'D) Unpack. You're home. 
ALI It's not even on the bus route. 
MARCUS Okay, that is the first and last time the term "bus route" will be spoken in this house. (motions out window) Four cars. Which do you want? 
EXT. MARCUS'S GAZEBO - SUNSET 
Ali lies on a chaise overlooking the panoramic view of L.A. against a fiery red sky. Marcus comes out of the house, with a bottle of wine. Crosses and sits next to her on the chaise. Marcus refills their wine glasses. An empty bottle already there. She sips as she leans back and relaxes. 
MARCUS Better? 
ALI 
(SMILES) Better. She looks out at a giant billboard at eye level. 
MARCUS You're gonna be on one of those someday. 
ALI Yeah, right. 
MARCUS Sooner than you think, too. Harold Saint called me today. You made quite an impression on him. 
ALI Really? What'd he say? 
MARCUS He wants to make a demo with you. 
ALI Are you serious? When?? 
MARCUS He found a little studio time on Tuesday. 
ALI This Tuesday? 
MARCUS Too soon? 
ALI No! Oh my god, no, that's amazing. You're amazing. 
MARCUS I like making you happy. Your whole face lights up. Their eyes meet. He pushes some hair out of her face. 
ALI I think you're way too nice to me. 
MARCUS And that's a problem because... 
ALI I've had a lot to drink. And my judgment is off. He touches her face, their chemistry palpable. 
MARCUS Hey, I'm a gentleman. Which means I'd never kiss a lady when she's... vulnerable. 
As Eva performs and the Bartenders and Jack sing, SEAN looks up at Dave, and MOTIONS for the SPOTLIGHT on Jack. Dave nods, and SWINGS the SPOTLIGHT hitting JACK. The Bartenders push Jack up onto the bar as he TAKES THE LEAD-- 
JACK 
.I SAID THAT'S LIFE, AND AS FUNNY 
AS IT MAY SEEM 
SOME PEOPLE GET THEIR KICKS, 
STOMPIN' ON A DREAM 
BUT I DON'T LET IT, LET IT GET ME DOWN, 
'CAUSE THIS FINE OL' WORLD IT KEEPS 
SPINNING AROUND... 
I'VE BEEN A PUPPET, A PAUPER, A 
PIRATE, A POET, A PAWN AND A KING. 
I'VE BEEN UP AND DOWN AND OVER AND 
OUT AND I KNOW ONE THING: 
EACH TIME I FIND MYSELF, FLAT ON MY 
FACE, I PICK MYSELF UP AND GET BACK 
IN THE RACE... The whole club is with him now, as Jack channels Sinatra, standing on the bar-- the Bartenders sing back-up. 
JACK (CONT'D) 
THAT'S LIFE. THAT'S LIFE AND I 
CAN'T DENY IT. MANY TIMES I THOUGHT 
OF CUTTING OUT, BUT MY HEART WON'T 
BUY IT. BUT IF THERE ' S NOTHING 
SHAKIN' COME THIS HERE JULY... 
I'M GONNA ROLL MYSELF UP IN A BIG 
BALL AND DIE. MY, MY. Applause, hoots and hollers. Jack high-fives and fist pumps his buddies, hugs Sean, grabs his bag and suitcase and EXITS out the back as... Tess ENTERS. SEES Sean is at the bar. He looks up-- 
SEAN How'd it go? (sees her face) Oh, shit. 
She grabs a bottle of Tequila and a glass, turns to walk off. 
SEAN (CONT'D) What are you gonna do? 
TESS Right now? Get really drunk. THE FRONT DOORS OPEN, and Ali ENTERS, spots Tess, rushes over to her. 
ALI Tess! I have to talk to you! Tess keeps walking. 
ALI (CONT'D) Marcus Gerber is trying to buy the lounge, and he's gonna tear it down and build a twenty-story skyscraper! Tess stops. Slowly turns and stares at Ali, who's suddenly embarrassed to admit... 
ALI (CONT'D) I just saw the plans. Tess looks at Ali. Stunned. Ali stands there, breathless, waiting for her reaction. But Tess just turns, continues up to her office, and shuts the door. Ali turns to Sean-- then starts after her-- 
ALI (CONT'D) She has to do something! She can't just let him -- 
SEAN 
(STOPPING HER) Let it go, girl. She just got turned down for another loan. It's either foreclose, or sell to Marcus. 
ALI So that's it? It's over? 
SEAN The circle of life, baby. All good things must come to an end. 
ALI But she can't just give up! 
SEAN She's not giving up. She's going down with her ship. With dignity. Ali sits on a barstool, in disbelief. 
SEAN (CONT'D) I've got something for you. He pulls out the photo of Ali with her mother. It's in a new frame. 
ALI Where'd you get this? 
SEAN Jack. He dropped it off on his way to the airport. 
ALI Where's he going? 
SEAN New York on the red-eye. 
ALI To be with Natalie? 
SEAN Pedal faster, baby, he and Natalie are over. You're the one he's been looking high and low for.

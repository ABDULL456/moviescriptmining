1   INT. PETER & MARIA'S BEDROOM - DAY                               1 
FADE IN on MARIA (late 20s), asleep in bed. She's breathtakingly beautiful. Morning light fills the room.      The sound of wind, and rippling cloth. 
Maria stirs, and opens her eyes.     She stretches contentedly. 
Then she frowns.    Rolls over.    She's alone in the bed? 
No, she's not: PETER (20s) sits on the edge, his back to her. Two fresh, steaming mugs of coffee sit on a tray near him. 
MARIA Hey.     Are you okay? 
Peter doesn't turn. He slowly stands and walks forward towards an OPEN WINDOW. 
There's something strange about the way he moves -- stiffly, almost jerkily, straining his joints and muscles. 
Maria gets out of bed, concerned. 
MARIA Peter?    What's the matter? 
He pauses at the window.    Turns his head to look back at her. 
His eyes are vacant.    His face is a blank. 
Then Peter slowly leans forward.     And falls from the window. 
Maria stands in shock as the sound of SCREECHING TIRES from outside reaches her ears. Then SCREAMS OF TERROR from below. 
Aghast, she finally manages to numbly walk forward, towards the window. We MOVE PAST her and TILT DOWN TO REVEAL -- 
-- PETER'S BODY lies in the middle of the street.     His head has burst open, his body broken and twisted. 
ON THE PAVEMENT: a line of blood appears, moving down the center of the screen. As if hitting grooves we cannot see -- 
-- the blood slowly forms the shape of two KANJI CHARACTERS. A translation appears over them: "The Grudge." 
2   EXT. STREET CORNER - DAY                                         2 
A blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a subway tunnel. Most are Japanese. We're not in Kansas.

Standing in the middle of the rush-hour pedestrian traffic is 
KAREN (20s, American). She faces upstream, looking for someone. The flow threatens to carry her away in a heartbeat. She looks fragile, intimidated by the madness. 
DOUG (O.S.) Karen! 
She turns to see her boyfriend DOUG (20s, American) approaching. With a reassuring smile he takes her hand -- 
-- and together, they force their way through the throng, trying to escape the flow. They're jostled and crushed by the crowd, and Doug protectively pulls Karen closer. 
KAREN I'll never get used to this. 
DOUG Maybe we should find a different train station. 
He abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still holding Karen's hand. She turns, wondering what's going on. She sees the smile on his lips a moment before -- 
-- he sweeps Karen into his arms and kisses her. As if the crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all. 
It's tender and loving, and she responds... at first.   But then she pulls away, shy. 
KAREN A public display of affection is considered rude in Japan. 
There's an opening ahead into a SIDE STREET.   Doug and Karen deftly slip out of the traffic -- 
2a                                                                 2a OMITTED 
2b   EXT. TOKYO STREET - DAY                                       2b 
-- and walk hand-in-hand down the much quieter street, away from the crowded thoroughfare. 
Doug smiles as they pass by two JAPANESE HIGH SCHOOL COUPLES, making out on the street corner. He turns to give Karen a sarcastic look --

ALEX Are you free this afternoon? 
KAREN I just came by to pick up some books I left here. I'm not scheduled to work today -- 
ALEX I know. But are you free?    Do you have class? 
KAREN (shaking her head:) Just a test to study for.   Why? 
Alex smiles, holding out a file. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04    6. 
ALEX Your wish has been granted. 
Karen takes the file and opens it, looking at the first page - - a picture of an OLDER WOMAN (EMMA) is attached. 
ALEX It's Yoko's case, but she didn't show up for work this morning, and I can't reach her at home. She must be sick, or something. And she has the damn house key. 
Studying the file, Karen squints. 
KAREN What's this phrase? 
ALEX "Mild dementia with severe lethargy." Apparently she sleeps through most of the day. Her daughter-in-law doesn't work, so she'll probably be there. 
Karen seems unsure.   It's a big step for her. 
ALEX You're the one who's been bugging me about getting out there on your own. Besides, it's an English-only house. 
One of Alex's CO-WORKERS appears in the doorway, motioning to him. Alex quickly hands Karen a card: 
ALEX Here's the address. Use the wall chart if you need help -- and don't forget to bring a map. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     7. 
Karen looks at THE ADDRESS -- a string of thirty numbers and Japanese characters. She glances up at 
THE WALL CHART: a color-coded diagram shows how the long address string is broken down into Postal Code, Prefecture, City, Ward, District, Block, Sub-Block and House Number. 
ALEX Don't worry Karen, you're ready. 
Karen nods.   But she's not quite as confident.

4a    INT. RAIL STATION - DAY                                     4a 
People rush madly around Karen as she studies A LARGE MAP on the wall. It's the Tokyo rail system -- daunting, at best. 
4b                                                                4b OMITTED 
4bb   INT. TRAIN - DAY                                           4bb 
Karen sits uncomfortably on the crowded transit car, squeezed in tightly by the people around her. The LOUD CRYING of a baby adds to her discomfort. 
5     EXT. RAIL PLATFORM - DAY                                        5 
The transit car pulls to a stop and a handful of people get out. Karen is one of them, shouldering her backpack. 
5a                                                                5a EXT. SHOPPING DISTRICT - DAY Karen walks down the populated sidewalk, weaving through STREET VENDORS, and passing a large GROCERY STORE. 
She pauses, looking at the address on her card. She approaches a WOMAN and her DAUGHTER (6) and speaks to them in Japanese. The woman nods, pointing towards a small ALLEY. 
Karen gives the daughter a smile;   the girl hides behind her mother's leg.

6    EXT. TOKYO NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY                                   6 
Karen exits the alley, entering a quiet, narrow street. She's still not sure if she's in the right place. 
But then her eyes fix on something. She begins to walk towards it, her gaze never leaving it -- 
6a   EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY                                          6a 
-- it's THE HOUSE.   Cozy and shaded, nestled into the dead end of the street.   Large by Tokyo standards. 
She double-checks the address and opens the gate, walking around a BICYCLE leaning against the wall and following the stepping-stone path to the front door. She knocks. No answer. She tries again. Nothing. 
Then, an afterthought, she tries the handle.   It's unlocked.

7    INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY                                7 
Karen walks back into the Living Room. She looks underneath the couch for the missing piece. Can't see anything. 
She lays down and sticks her arm under the couch, feeling around. Nothing. 
Karen sticks her arm in deeper, to the shoulder, straining... 
She suddenly jerks her arm back, wincing.   She has a small cut on her finger. 
Karen looks under the couch for what cut her -- 
-- a small FURNITURE NAIL sticks out underneath. 
KAREN Nice one, Karen. 
She gets to her feet, folding up the incomplete picture and stuffing it into her pocket. 
INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DUSK Karen steps into the foyer with the vacuum cleaner. She looks up at A RAILING overhead. Some trash is visible sticking over the edge. Karen shakes her head: 
KAREN How did you get up there? 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       11. 
She gathers up the vacuum and heads up to the SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY. There's a nearby door, closed (the FRONT ROOM), and an open door at the end (the REAR ROOM). 
As she looks for an outlet, she hears a SCRATCHING SOUND. 
Karen stands there for a moment, listening.    Silence. 
Then she walks towards the open door at the end of the hall. 
17   INT. THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - DUSK                            17 
Karen steps inside. MOVING BOXES are stacked against the wall, next to a desk. It's an unfinished room. 
She listens.   No scratching.   Nothing unusual here.   Except -- 
Karen notices a lone object sitting on an otherwise empty shelf. It's a BLACK CERAMIC CAT. Facing the wall. Strange. 
And then Karen hears the SCRATCHING SOUND again. 
INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DUSK Karen steps into the hallway and listens.   There it is again, and this time there's no doubt -- 
The sounds are coming from the room by the stairs. 
Karen walks to the door. She pauses, disturbed by the eerie sounds from inside. Then she reaches for the doorknob. 
THUD. THUD. Karen hesitates. The strange rhythmic THUDDING continues, coming from beyond the door. 
KAREN (nervous:) Hello? 
Karen takes a breath.   And turns the doorknob. 
INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DUSK The sounds immediately stop as Karen enters the MASTER BEDROOM. It's dark, thick blinds covering the windows. A frosted window, overlooking the foyer, isn't helping much. 
She stands there for a moment, listening.   Silence. 
Then -- 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     12. 
SCRATCH SCRATCH. Startled, she gasps and turns towards THE CLOSED CLOSET DOORS. That's where the sound is coming from. 
And then she notices something strange about the closet door: 
It's been sealed shut with duct tape. 
The SCRATCHING quickens, as if sensing a presence nearby. 
And then there's a muffled MEOW.   There's a cat in there? 
Karen pulls off the duct tape. She reaches for the door handle, slowly sliding it open a crack and peering inside -- 
The closet seems empty, except for a large BOOK on a shelf. Karen reaches inside and picks it up. 
Then she sees, in the darkened far corner of the closet, a SMALL BLACK CAT. It's sitting on something, watching her. 
Karen slides the door the rest of the way open -- 
-- revealing A YOUNG JAPANESE BOY (age 7) sitting in the corner, staring at Karen. The cat is curled up on his lap. 
Startled, Karen drops the book and falls backwards. 
INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Karen is on her cell phone: 
KAREN (INTO PHONE) Yes, he was shut in a closet! There was tape around the -- No, they're not home yet. I don't know, Emma hasn't said a word to me -- He's still upstairs -- yes, I'm sure he's Japanese -- But -- Yes, alright, Alex. Just please get here as soon as you can. 
Emma looks up at Karen with pleading eyes. 
EMMA I just want her to leave me alone. 
Karen sits down next to her. 
KAREN You should get some rest, Emma. 
She helps Emma lie back -- 
-- but as the old woman's eyes move to the ceiling, they suddenly grow wide, her mouth opening in fear -- 
-- Karen follows her gaze, looking up -- 
-- and she SCREAMS, falling off the mattress, backing away -- 
A MURKY BLACKNESS is lowering from the ceiling. Formless at first, but flowing and shifting... like a FIGURE draped with black silk. Drifting down until the shadowy "head" is only inches from Emma's terrified face. 
And then the "head" slowly turns, rotating towards Karen. 
In the midst of the blackness are TWO DISEMBODIED EYES. Filled with an intense rage. Focused directly on Karen. 
Off Karen's NERVE-SHATTERING SCREAM, we... 
CUT TO BLACK. 
INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - NIGHT MATTHEW and his wife JENNIFER are in bed. He sleeps soundly, she doesn't. She's staring at the ceiling, listening to -- 
-- SOUNDS coming in through the open bedroom door. Someone moving downstairs, fumbling around, bumping into things. 
Jennifer, frustrated, lets out a sigh. 
INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - MORNING 
Matthew comes downstairs, dressed in a business suit.    He pauses to pick up some of the RUBBISH on the stairs.

26   INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING                          26 
Jennifer watches the last drops of coffee fall into the pot. She pours herself a mug, takes a big sip. Looks exhausted. 
Matthew enters, surprised to see her. 
MATTHEW You're up? 
JENNIFER Mmmmmm. 
Matthew glances into the back room through another sliding door -- the windows on this one are clear, not frosted like the living room. 
HIS POV:   Emma is asleep on her mattress. 
MATTHEW I wonder if Mom's okay. She's been sleeping ever since we got here. 
JENNIFER Not at night. 
Matthew turns to her, surprised. 
JENNIFER I told you, Matthew, you can sleep through anything. 
Matthew comes over, kisses her. 
MATTHEW I'm sorry, sweetheart. It was probably just the move -- I'm sure she'll get back on schedule. 
Jennifer nods, not convinced. 
MATTHEW You seen my travel mug? 
JENNIFER I didn't unpack it yet. 
Matthew kneels down next to a pair of MOVING BOXES in the corner -- `KITCHEN' written on the side. He explores it. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   17. 
MATTHEW Maybe you should say something to the helper, what's her name? 
JENNIFER Yoko. 
MATTHEW Who knows? Maybe there's something she can suggest. 
JENNIFER Yeah.     Maybe. 
He finds his travel mug, wrapped in the sports section of an American newspaper. Matthew scans it as he fills his mug. 
MATTHEW I miss seeing this every morning. No response from his wife. He turns to see Jennifer looking down at Emma through the window. 
And they lead away from the back room, down the main hallway. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      20. 
Jennifer looks back up to see Emma watching her. 
30   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY                                30 
Jennifer follows the DAMP FOOTPRINTS. They're getting lighter, and cease altogether in the foyer. 
She stands there for a moment, bewildered. Then she tenses, as if sensing she's being watched. She slowly turns to see -- 
-- A BLACK CAT. Sitting on the first landing of the stairs. Staring at her with bright yellow eyes. 
As Jennifer takes a step towards it -- 
TWO CHILD'S HANDS reach around the corner, and pick up the cat, pulling it out of view. 
Jennifer freezes. 
JENNIFER Who's -- who's there? 
No response. She walks up the stairs and looks around the corner. Nothing there. 
She takes a deep breath, and starts to climb. 
INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY Reaching the top, Jennifer catches a glimpse of a familiar BOY running into the FRONT ROOM. 
She slowly walks towards the open door -- we can't see inside the room from the hallway. But she pauses as she hears -- 
THUD.   THUD.   The same rhythmic thumping that Karen heard. 
After a moment, Jennifer steps inside the room, disappearing from our sight. 
We hear her suddenly draw a GASP. 
A beat. As we DRIFT CLOSER to the doorway, we notice something strange: the room appears to be growing darker. A SHARP BREATHING can be heard from inside... quick, panicked gulps of air. Growing faster. 
Just as we reach the doorway, the harsh breathing stops. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   20A. 
A moment of stillness. 
Then the door is SLAMMED SHUT from the inside.

32   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                                 32 
Matthew enters from work, jacket slung over his shoulder. 
MATTHEW (calling out) Sorry I'm late, it took awhile to wrap things up. 
He leaves his briefcase by the door and turns to the hall -- 
-- noticing the house is completely DARK. 
MATTHEW Jen?   Susan? 
INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Matthew turns on the lights. The room has reverted to its messy state, even worse than before. 
He looks down at A PICTURE, formerly hanging on the wall, now lying on the ground. The glass is broken. 
MATTHEW What the hell? -- 
He quickly goes to the BACK ROOM. Emma sits on the edge of her bed, dazed and staring. In the darkness. 
MATTHEW Mom?   Are you alright? 
No answer.    He kneels down next to her. 
MATTHEW Where's Jennifer, Mom? 
Still nothing.      He surveys the mess in the room.   Angrily: 
MATTHEW Did Yoko come today, Mom? Remember? The pretty girl? 
He gets to his feet, looking at the SPILLED SOUP in the living room, now hardened and crusty. 
34   INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT                     34

Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     22. 
INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT The DOORBELL rings.   Then a few more times. 
SUSAN (American, late 20s) enters, with two bottles of wine. 
SUSAN Hello? 
She kicks off her shoes. 
SUSAN You guys in the kitchen? 
INT. THE HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Susan walks in, puts the wine on the table.     Looks around. 
SUSAN (calling out:) I thought you guys were gonna cook! 
She goes into the BACK ROOM.    Sits next to Emma. 
SUSAN Hi, Mom.    How are you feeling? 
Emma turns to her with her usual vacant look. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      24A. 
There's a CREAK from above.   Susan looks up at the ceiling. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       25. 
SUSAN I guess I came at a bad time, huh? 
41   INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT                            41 
Twisting a corkscrew into a wine bottle, Susan leans into the foyer, yelling upstairs: 
SUSAN I'll give you guys one minute to finish whatever you're doing up there and get your butts down here. 
As she heads back towards the kitchen, we CRANE UP to see -- 
MATTHEW. He's walking down the second floor hall. He looks different: the expression on his face is troubled, occupied. 
And he's dragging his dead wife's body.   By the hair. 
He pulls her inside the REAR ROOM -- the doorway looks more imposing, more ominous, than before. It's dark and malevolent, the threshold to a secret that won't stay buried. 
We CRANE BACK DOWN to see Susan in the kitchen.   She's poured a glass of wine and sighs impatiently. 
She walks back down the hall into the foyer. 
SUSAN I mean it, guys. 
Silence from upstairs.   Shaking her head: 
SUSAN Well, I warned you. Prepare to be emotionally scarred. 
She starts up the stairs and turns the first corner -- 
-- MATTHEW is sitting there, hands on his knees, looking harried. Susan YELPS. 
SUSAN Matthew!   Don't scare me like that! 
He's shaking slightly.   His eyes drift up to hers. 
SUSAN What's going on?   Where's Jennifer? 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      26. 
MATTHEW She went out. Something came up. 
SUSAN I hope she's not long.    I'm absolutely starving. 
Matthew looks back down at his feet.      Susan misreads: 
SUSAN I knew it. You guys forgot to go shopping, didn't you? 
Matthew abruptly stands.    Looming over his sister. 
MATTHEW I'm sorry.     This is a bad time. 
SUSAN Are you okay? What's going on? 
MATTHEW You should go. 
He moves forward, right into her. His momentum pushes Susan back into the foyer. She holds onto his shirt: 
SUSAN Did something happen?    What's -- 
Matthew's hands suddenly TIGHTEN ON HER SHOULDERS. His eyes grow wide, filled with anger, as he whispers fiercely -- 
JENNIFER Why? 
Susan asks Suzuki in Japanese.    He shrugs. 
SUZUKI (trying his English:) Ex-pen-sive. 
Matthew suddenly realizes: 
MATTHEW Where's Mom? 
We slowly CRANE UP to the SECOND FLOOR HALL, moving towards the REAR ROOM at the end. The door is ajar. 
44a                                                            44a INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY Susan comes up the stairs, worried. 
SUSAN Mom?   Where are you? 
44b   INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY                        44b 
Susan looks inside -- Emma isn't there. She's about to leave when something catches her attention. She walks to 
THE CLOSET. The door is open. Susan kneels down, looking at something inside it. She picks it up -- 
-- it's the CERAMIC CAT Karen found earlier. As Susan examines it, she notices something on the wall of the closet (which we don't see). Her face softens, and she smiles. 
MATTHEW (O.S.) Did you get her? 
SUSAN (under her breath:) Take a pill, will ya? 
Susan stands and walks out of the room. But we stay in the closet, PANNING TO REVEAL the closet wall. It's covered with BLACK CRAYON, low to the ground, the work of a child. The images are dozens of BLACK CATS.

Emma stands in the dead center of the empty bedroom. 
Looking directly up at the ceiling. 
Susan enters, placing the ceramic cat on THE SHELF where Karen found it earlier. Except Susan faces it INTO THE ROOM. 
SUSAN C'mon, Mom. You know what the doctor said about stairs. 
She takes Emma's hand, but the old woman doesn't move. 
Matthew and Jennifer enter, worried. 
MATTHEW She okay? 
SUSAN Mom?   What is it? 
Everyone follows her gaze to the ceiling.   Only Emma has the unmistakable look of dread on her face. 
A long beat. 
INT. THE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY Suzuki walks from the kitchen into the hallway, giving the place one final look-over. 
He pauses by the open bathroom door.   Looks inside.

Suzuki enters, looking at THE TUB:    filled to the brim. 
After a moment, Suzuki kneels down next to the bathtub.     He pulls the thin CHAIN connected to the rubber stopper -- 
-- but the end of the chain comes out of the water.      Hmmm. It's not connected after all. 
Suzuki eyes the plug at the bottom of the tub. 
Then he takes off his jacket.   Rolls up his shirt sleeve. 
And reaches into the water for the rubber stopper. 
It's just out of reach. 
He rolls up his sleeve a little more.   Reaches deeper -- 
-- suddenly there's a BURST OF SOUND: a dull THUMPING, something THRASHING in water, the SCREAMING of a YOUNG BOY, voice MUFFLED by water -- 
-- Suzuki recoils as water SPLASHES UP around him -- 
-- he falls away from the tub in horror, landing on his butt. 
THE BATHTUB: Filled to the brim.     Still and silent.    Not so much as a ripple on the surface.

-- but her lucky RABBIT'S FOOT gets caught on the door latch. Panicking, Susan struggles to free herself -- 
Through the crack, she sees the darkness continuing to come down. The lights on Susan's floor FLICKER. 
Susan looks up to see A PALE BOY on the landing to the higher floor. The SAME BOY is also standing on the landing of each floor above. They're all staring down at Susan. 
Susan screams as she desperately tries to yank her chain free... and then she sees THE PALE HAND clutching her rabbit's foot! 
The door shuts, and Susan falls backwards into the hallway. 
She jumps to her feet and runs down the hall.

A cramped room. Susan stands in the doorway, animatedly talking to a young SECURITY GUARD sitting at a desk lined with VIDEO MONITORS. She's speaking rapidly, and shaking: 
SUSAN (IN JAPANESE) In the stairs... there was... something... a strange person... all the lights were going out... 
The Guard doesn't understand her -- in her panic, Susan's MISPRONOUNCING HER WORDS, and she knows it. 
Susan takes a breath, frustrated and frightened. 
SUSAN (pleading, in English) Please. Help me. 
The Guard stands, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. 
GUARD (IN JAPANESE) I'll take a look. Wait here. 
The Guard leaves.   Susan doesn't look thrilled to be alone.

54b   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT                54b 
Susan takes a breath and sits down, trying to relax. It's obvious that she feels safer, here in the Security Room. 
Then she notices movement on one of the SECURITY MONITORS -- 
ON THE SCREEN: -- the GUARD continues down the 10TH FLOOR HALL, stopping at the door to the stairwell. 
Susan leans toward the monitor for a better view. 
ON THE SCREEN: the Guard opens the stairwell door and leans inside, checking it out. 
ON SUSAN:   her eyes are glued to the screen.   Waiting. 
ON THE SCREEN: the Guard, finding nothing out of the ordinary, closes the door and continues on down the hall. 
SUSAN leans back, exhaling.    Relieved. 
Then the video CRACKLES with a sudden quick burst of static. 
And Susan GASPS, sitting upright, as she sees -- 
ON THE SCREEN:   the stairwell door OPENS AGAIN.   And then -- 
-- something DARK moves out of the stairwell, entering the hallway. 
INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Susan quickly draws the chain lock. Then she builds the courage to step forward, and look through the peephole -- 
HER POV: the phone lies broken in the middle of the floor. Otherwise, the hallway is empty. 
Susan backs away from the door, shaking in fright. 
Breathing hard, she backs into --

62    INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT                        62 
Susan enters, turning off her cell phone and unplugging the bedroom phone from the wall. 
Then she retreats to the safety of her bed, eyes on -- 
THE APARTMENT DOOR, next to the kitchen.    Silence. 
Susan's breathing slows. But she looks around the room, still anxious -- it's too quiet in here. Her panic builds. But she's alone in the room, isn't she? 
As we MOVE IN on Susan, the room starts to become quieter. The SOUND OF TRAFFIC from outside, the HUMMING REFRIGERATOR in the kitchen... everything fades to a stifling silence. 
And Susan notices, all right.    Her breath, now suddenly loud, catches in her throat. 
A long moment of silence.   Then -- 
-- DRIP.   DRIP. 
It's coming from the KITCHEN SINK. 
Susan stares at it.   She finally stands, and --

Relieved, Susan turns away -- 
-- DRIP.   DRIP.   It begins again.   Louder, more intense. 
Scared, Susan turns back to the sink. Water is now GUSHING OUT from the faucet, filling up a bowl in the sink. 
She slowly reaches out a hand and turns the faucet, as tightly as she can manage -- 
-- tighter... tighter... straining with the effort.. 
Until the water stops.   Only then does she let go -- 
-- just then, a CHILD'S PALE HAND quietly rises to the surface from water in the bowl, and starts VIOLENTLY SPLASHING the surface.

Susan screams and runs back to her bedroom -- 
62b   INT. SUSAN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT                    62b 
She lies down, shivering, pulling the quilt to her chin.      A final retreat. 
SUSAN Please... stop it... 
The SPLASHING SOUNDS in the kitchen continue for a while. Then, it suddenly stops. 
Susan is so terrified that she almost faints. 
Then her breathing stops.   Her eyes widen. 
Her hand reaches up under her pillow, feeling around -- 
-- and she comes out with HER LUCKY RABBIT'S FOOT. 
The one she left behind in the stairwell. 
Susan suddenly CRIES OUT, her head tilting back, her body abruptly going stiff. We soon see why: 
A LUMP begins to rise at the foot of the bed. A big one. Moving slowly up Susan's body. Reaching the edge of the quilt, which slowly rises -- 
-- revealing a QUICK FLASH of the PALE FACE OF THE JAPANESE WOMAN WITH LONG DARK HAIR on top of her! 
Susan SCREAMS, and is abruptly pulled under the covers -- 
CUT TO BLACK.

Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04       43. 
-- YOKO'S BICYCLE.   He looks down at it, frowning. 
Then he suddenly cocks his head.    As if sensing something. 
He turns to look up at A WINDOW ON THE SECOND FLOOR. 
It's empty.

Igarashi stands by the ANSWERING MACHINE.    The message counter reads `1'. He presses PLAY. 
SUSAN'S MESSAGE replays, and he listens carefully. As it ends, he turns to see NAKAGAWA standing in the doorway. 
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE) That's Matthew's sister. 
He shows Nakagawa a PHOTO of Matthew and Susan, brother and sister, grinning at the camera. 
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE) This must be her.

NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE) Call her at work, then at home. If no one answers, send someone to -- 
He trails off, looking down at -- 
-- the PHONE BASE.   The cordless phone is missing. 
Nakagawa reaches down, pressing the `LOCATE' button. 
A distant BEEPING SOUND can be heard. 
Everyone in the room stops what they're doing.    They listen.

EXT. TOKYO STREET - DAY CLOSE ON the spinning wheels of a bicycle.      A familiar one.

77a   EXT. THE HOUSE - DAY                                         77a 
Yoko opens the gate and walks her bike to the front door, leaning it against the wall nearby (exactly where we saw Matthew bump into it earlier). 
She rings the door buzzer. Waits. She seems to have expected this: she pulls a KEY from her pocket, with a plastic LABEL on it. 
INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - DAY Yoko steps inside. She instinctively slips off her shoes. She calls out, in decent English: 
YOKO Hi, excuse me? 
There's a small ENVELOPE with YOKO'S NAME resting on a small table by the door. She takes it, opens it.

79   INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                           79 
The house is the least "moved-into" that we've seen so far: although the main furniture is in place, MOVING BOXES are stacked in every room, in various stages of unpacking. 
But there's also an unusual amount of mess in the house -- a disarray, much like the opening sequence, that isn't exactly related to moving in. 
Yoko surveys the room, dismayed by the mess. 
Then she sees EMMA at the far end of the living room, her back to Yoko. She's looking down at something in her hands. 
YOKO Hi, Emma.    It's good to see you again. 
Emma turns. Looks blankly at Yoko, who approaches. Realizing the woman doesn't remember her: 
YOKO My name is Yoko. 
The old woman still gives no sign of recognition.   Yoko gently takes her arm. 
YOKO You should be in bed -- 
Then she sees what Emma was looking at: the roll of DUCT TAPE. She's cut her finger on the serrated cutting blade. 
YOKO (IN JAPANESE) You shouldn't be playing with this! 
Shaking her head, Yoko takes the duct tape and looks around for a place where Emma can't get at it -- 
-- she puts the tape ON THE STACK OF BOOKS at the top of the bookshelf, next to the scissors (where Matthew found them).

From the entrance, we see Yoko come out of the kitchen holding a tray with a teapot and cup. 
She walks into the BACK ROOM, looking down at Emma's bed. The old woman must be asleep: Yoko gently lays down the tray, quietly steps out of the room and slides the door shut. 
Then Yoko moves through the LIVING ROOM to the PHONE BASE -- 
-- she picks up THE CORDLESS, finally where it belongs. 
Yoko dials a number as she walks into THE ENTRANCE HALL.     She begins a conversation (in Japanese) as she looks at the scattered rubbish on the ground, shaking her head. 
She climbs up to the SECOND FLOOR, pausing to kneel and pick up some pieces of crumpled paper, chatting all the while. 
THUD. THUD. Yoko pauses, turning towards the open door to the front room. The rhythmic THUMPING continues.

-- THE ATTIC PANEL above her is wide open. 
Caught between a rock and a hard place.   Yoko decides: 
She shakily stands on the shelf and reaches up to pull herself into the attic. 
INT. ATTIC - DAY Yoko's head appears. Then her shoulders.     She looks around, but can't see a thing in the darkness. 
She's about to pull herself all the way up -- 
-- when she hears the THROATY CROAKING SOUND. 
Coming from the darkness. 
Yoko stiffens, her breath catching in her throat. 
ANOTHER POV: we're at the far end of the attic, suddenly and rapidly RACING FORWARD TOWARDS YOKO... 
ON YOKO:   something brushes her face.   Long, black hair. 
There's a head, just inches from hers.    Almost nose-to-nose. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      51. 
Yoko is paralyzed with fear, eyes wide.   A long beat. 
Then she reaches into her pocket, pulling out a LIGHTER. 
Yoko raises it and flicks the wheel -- 
-- we get a glimpse of a PALE FACE, surrounded by long black hair, eyes wide and mouth open, the THROATY SOUND suddenly increasing in pitch and volume -- 
-- as the face moves forward --

89   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                    89 
Karen slowly wakes up in bed.    As her eyes clear, she sees -- 
DOUG. He sits on the edge of the bed, slightly slumped, his back to her. 
He slowly turns -- and a relieved smile crosses his face.     He moves closer, and reaches out a hand. 
DOUG It's okay.     I've got you. 
Karen nods, lacing her fingers in his. But her eyes are glazed and unfocused -- she's exhausted. 
DOUG Your boss told me what happened. I'm sorry. 
She turns away, the memory bothering her.    Doug takes her hand, massaging her fingers, worried. 
DOUG I talked to your teachers. They said you can take as much time as you need. We could go to Kyoto for a weekend, see those temples you're always talking about. 
Karen tries to smile back, but her heart's not in it. 
KAREN Running away won't help. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04   51aA. 
DOUG There's nothing to run away from, Kat. No one blames you for what happened. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     51A. 
KAREN I'm not even sure what did happen. 
DOUG You went to help someone who was, quite simply, beyond help. 
KAREN No, that's not what I mean... 
She trails off, trying to remember.   Doug waits. 
KAREN That house. There was something... 
Doug sees her frustration, and tenderly brushes a hair from her face. 
DOUG Don't beat yourself up searching for a greater truth, Kat. An old woman passed away in her sleep. It's sad, but that's all it is -- 
KAREN Is that how they said she died? 
DOUG I'm sorry this happened to you. But maybe, in a way, it will help you later. Death is an unfortunate but integral part of your future career. There's no avoiding it. Maybe now you'll be more... ready for it. 
KAREN I don't think I'll ever be ready for something like that. 
She turns away. Doug wraps an arm around her.   Karen leans into him, and he strokes her hair. 
KAREN Detective Nakagawa? 
He looks up at her, a faraway look in his eyes. 
KAREN The whole time I was in that house, I felt something was... wrong. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     54A. 
From the expression on Nakagawa's face, she's onto something. 
KAREN What happened there? 
Nakagawa holds Karen's gaze for a moment. Even in her exhausted state, it's clear -- she's as frightened as he is. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      55. 
NAKAGAWA The bodies of the son and daughter- in-law of the woman you were caring for were found in the attic. 
Karen just stares at him, stunned. 
NAKAGAWA It seems that the son killed his wife, and then himself -- 
There's a KNOCK on the door. Igarashi stands in the doorway. He speaks to Nakagawa in Japanese. 
NAKAGAWA (to Karen) Please excuse me for a moment. 
Nakagawa puts the photo down and steps into the hallway and closes the door, but not all the way. Karen watches and listens through the crack: 
INT. HOSPIAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT IN THE HALLWAY:   the men speak with hushed voices. 
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE) We checked the apartment of Susan, the sister. She wasn't there... 
He trails off, hesitating. 
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE) Yes? 
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE) The chain lock had been drawn from the inside. And the deadbolt. But we found no one in the apartment. 
Nakagawa takes this in. 
NAKAGAWA (IN JAPANESE) Get the surveillance tapes from the office building. 
Igarashi nods.    But doesn't move.   After a moment, quietly: 
IGARASHI (IN JAPANESE) They were the first family to live in that house since the incident three years ago -- 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        56. 
Nakagawa's harsh look silences him. Then the Detective turns, noticing KAREN watching them. He pulls the door shut. 
91   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT                                      91 
Nakagawa's stern voice is muffled by the closed door.    Karen sits back in bed, disturbed. 
Then her attention turns to THE FILE on the table. 
She considers.   Then reaches for it.   Opens it. 
It's a POLICE REPORT, in Japanese. 
Karen scans it, and turns the page.     She draws a breath -- 
-- it's a photo of THE HOUSE. Cordoned off with police tape. An ambulance out front. Like the scene she just left... 
...only the picture is dated three years ago. 
THREE DETECTIVES are visible beyond the open front door, conferring in the entryway. 
The photo of the house is attached to a POLICE REPORT, with THREE PICTURES. A stern-looking Japanese man (TAKEO), a somber woman (KAYAKO), and a YOUNG BOY we know very well -- 
Karen makes the connection. She picks up the taped-up photo and compares it to the file... the boy and his father are the same as in the newspaper. 
Karen gently touches the "missing" face of KAYAKO -- then her eyes move to the picture of THE BOY. 
Her eyes widen as she reads THE JAPANESE TEXT under his face: 
KAREN Toshio... 
INT. NURSING CARE CENTER - NIGHT The place is quiet, completely deserted.    Except for -- 
-- Alex. He's behind his desk in the reception area, staring off into space. Alex finally glances up at a clock -- it's almost ten o'clock. 
He gets up, turns off his computer, switches off the lights, and walks around the reception desk towards -- 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     57. 
Bewildered, he sits down, leaning forward and taking a good look. His eyes stop on the picture of TOSHIO. 
Doug turns to see Karen staring at him from the kitchen. It's an awkward moment: he's concerned, but doesn't know what to say. And neither does Karen. 
Finally she approaches, looking at Toshio's picture: 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      69A. 
KAREN That's the boy who was there yesterday. In that house. But this boy, he's -- 
Her voice trembles, her fear showing through. 
KAREN -- he's supposed to be dead. 
A beat.   Karen's eyes plead with Doug. 
KAREN I saw him, Doug. I talked to him. He told me his name. A boy who was killed by his father three years ago told me his name. 
Doug looks away, shaking his head. 
KAREN You don't believe me. 
DOUG How can I believe you, Karen? 
Karen's face darkens.   Before she can retort -- 
-- the phone RINGS. As Karen walks across the room to answer it, Doug starts reading the newspaper article. 
KAREN (INTO PHONE) Hello? 
She listens.   Her face slowly drops. 
KAREN (almost a whisper:) What? 
She numbly lowers the phone.   Doug turns to her, seeing that something's very wrong. 
Snapping to life, Karen walks to the desk, picking up the photo of Peter and Maria's condo and a map of Tokyo. 
Doug puts a hand on her shoulder.    She finally looks at him. 
KAREN Alex and Yoko are dead. 
Doug, surprised, doesn't know what to say.   Karen doesn't give him a chance to figure it out: 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        69AA. 
KAREN (intense:) There's something wrong with that house, Doug. Something really bad. (re: Peter's photo) The boy in that house, he had a photo of this man. He died on that same day three years ago. I need to talk to his wife... widow. If I can find out what happened, or if... maybe -- 
DOUG Maybe, what? 
Karen pulls away, making for the door.   Doug follows. 
DOUG I'm concerned about you going out while you're so upset -- 
KAREN You don't understand.   I have to, Doug. 
DOUG Why? 
KAREN Because I've been inside that house, Doug. Don't you get it? I've been inside! 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     69B. 
A beat. We see the resolve come over Karen's face.   She reaches out and touches Doug tenderly. 
KAREN I love you. But I have to go. 
She leaves. 
Doug, troubled, turns back to the desk. 
He looks up at the wall, tracing a finger over the photo of The House. Beneath it, is the address...

The same building from the newspaper clipping.   Monolithic against a cloudy, bleak sky. 
Karen stands before it, staring up at it. 
Then she walks to the intercom and looks at the directory, finds `M. Kirk'. She activates the intercom and dials the number. It rings a few times, and then a voice picks up: 
MARIA (INTERCOM, IN JAPANESE) Yes? 
KAREN I'm looking for Maria Kirk? 
KAREN I think there's a connection between your husband's death and something that happened to me. 
MARIA What happened to you? 
KAREN It's... hard to explain. 
Maria takes a drag from her cigarette.    Waiting. 
KAREN Look, I know this sounds strange, but... I don't think your husband wanted to die. 
MARIA (even:) Then why would he throw himself out a window? 
Karen struggles to find the answer. 
MARIA Let me guess: `hard to explain'? 
Karen nods.   Maria's brave face slips.   She turns away. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04    74B. 
MARIA I put all this behind me. I don't want to open it back up again. 
KAREN If that's true, then why are you still here in Japan? 
Maria turns back.   She only looks defensive for a moment. 
MARIA Because I can't leave. I tried. But I couldn't. Not without... 
Maria speaks softly, forming words she's never spoken aloud: 
MARIA He usually didn't wake up before me. But that morning, he did. He made coffee for us. Then he sat there and waited for me to wake up. And when I did, he looked me right in the eye. And then he jumped. The night before we'd been talking about having children together... 
She wipes away the tears in her eyes. 
KAREN Did you know a woman named Kayako? 
MARIA No. 
KAREN Did Peter? 
MARIA I don't think so. 
Maria turns away, growing tense. 
KAREN Maybe it was someone he worked with? 
MARIA Look. I've had the police up here, I talked with Detectives, I even hired a P.I.-- (composing herself:) (MORE)

She turns back to Karen -- to find the young woman sitting slumped on the edge of a sofa, tears in her eyes. 
Maria softens as Karen looks up at her, pleading: 
KAREN Please. I don't know what else to do. Please help me.

Maria re-enters the room, laying the shoeboxes on a table. 
MARIA This is all his stuff from school. 
She stares at the boxes, afraid to open them. Karen sits down and gently removes the lid of one of them. 
THE BOX contains stacks of PHOTOGRAPHS and notes. Karen removes a pile of photos and starts looking through it. 
After a moment, Maria sits down next to her. She opens the other box and pulls out another stack of photos. 
She looks at the first one, sadness crossing her face. 
MARIA This was our first date. 
She shows Karen THE TOP PHOTO: a "self-portrait" of Peter and Maria in a park lined with blooming cherry trees. 
The pain returns, and she puts the picture away. 
PETER (IN JAPANESE) Hello. 
No reaction. There's definitely something wrong with this boy. Peter looks beyond him, into the dark house. 
PETER (IN JAPANESE) My name is Peter. I'm here to see your mother. Is she home? 
The boy slowly straightens. His eyes focus on Peter. Then he FALLS BACKWARDS. Startled, Peter tries to see inside: 
PETER (IN JAPANESE) Hey!   Are you okay??? Hello??? 
Peter quickly goes back to the front door.   Tries the handle - - it's unlocked. He opens the door.

Peter enters, finding Toshio lying on the floor. He must have been standing on the edge of a TUB by the window. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        81. 
PETER (IN JAPANESE) Are you alright? 
As Peter helps the boy to his feet, he glances at the bathtub. It's filled, literally to the brim, with water. 
124   INT. THE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY                             124 
Peter holds Toshio's hand as he leads him back to a couch in the living room. 
PETER (IN JAPANESE) Are you alone? Where are your parents? 
The boy sits in the couch, slumped over, still looking dazed. 
Peter studies him, looking at the ugly BRUISES on his arms and legs. There's also a big one around his neck. 
PETER (IN JAPANESE) What happened to you? 
Peter reaches out to lift Toshio's chin, but he FLINCHES, pulling backwards. His eyes manage to focus on Peter. 
Then the boy looks away.    Lowers his head.   A long beat. 
Peter's worried. This really doesn't look good.     He scans the messy room, eyes falling on something. 
He reaches down and picks up PIECES OF A PHOTOGRAPH, lying next to a broken frame -- they've been crumpled into a ball. 
ON THE PHOTO: Peter unfolds the pieces and rearranges them. We've seen this picture before -- 
-- a FAMILY PORTRAIT. TOSHIO, holding a cute BLACK CAT. Standing with his mother and father -- KAYAKO and TAKEO. They're all beaming at the camera, a perfect, happy family. 
Except that the mother's face has been torn out. 
Then there's a muffled MEOW.    Peter looks over at the window. Did that come from outside? 
Another MEOW.   Peter walks to the window, looking out. 
FROM OUTSIDE, LOOKING IN: a worried look crosses Peter's face as the MEOW becomes more of a GROWL, as if in warning. He looks outside, but can't see anything -- 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04        82. 
-- but we see, over Peter's shoulder, that TOSHIO is now LOOKING DIRECTLY AT HIM, eyes wide -- 
-- the MEOWING emitting from his wide open mouth -- 
125   INT. POLICE STATION - DAY                                   125 
Karen enters quickly, going up to the front desk. 
OFFICER #2, filling out paperwork, doesn't look up. 
KAREN (IN JAPANESE) Excuse me, I need to speak with Detective Nakagawa. 
Officer #2 looks up at her.   Blankly. 
KAREN (IN JAPANESE) It's an emergency. 
OFFICER #2 (IN JAPANESE) One moment. 
Officer #2 walks to the end of the desk, where two more OFFICERS speak in hushed tones with DETECTIVE AOKI. 
Officer #2 interrupts their conversation. And they all look over at Karen. A beat. Then Detective Aoki approaches. 
Peter backs away in horror -- 
130   INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT               130 
Peter backs into the hallway, breathing hard. 
Then a familiar sound reaches our ears:   THUD.   THUD.   THUD. 
It's coming from Toshio's room. And it's the same rhythmic THUDDING we've heard coming from this room before. 
Peter wrenches his gaze from the horrific sight and heads quickly down the hall (with Karen following him): 
PETER Toshio!   We have to -- 
He stops short at the door, as he sees -- 
-- TAKEO, Toshio's father. Eyes rolled back in his head, tongue swollen and lolling from his blue lips. 
He's dead -- he's hanging from the ceiling by BLACK HAIR that seems to cover its entire surface. Kayako's hair. 
TOSHIO, now back to his "dead" appearance, playfully swings the body. Takeo's feet THUD rhythmically against the wall. 
KAREN Oh my God... 
Peter doesn't stay to see any more.   He runs. 
INT. THE HOUSE - ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
Peter tears down the stairs and runs for the front door, passing a mirror -- 
-- he freezes. He saw SOMETHING in the reflection as he passed. Something wrong. He takes a step back and looks -- 
-- it's not his reflection in the mirror.   It's KAYAKO. 
Peter stares at the image in disbelief. Then he notices TOSHIO standing next to Kayako, looking up at her. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     89A. 
As Peter slowly turns to look down, a small PALE HAND slips into his own. Peter jerks backward in shock as -- 
A SERIES OF IMAGES, THE ORIGIN OF "THE GRUDGE", FLASH BY: 
-- TAKEO, looking down at THE JOURNAL, reading his wife's words, his face contorted with rage... he turns to see KAYAKO, home from work, standing in the doorway... 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      90. 
-- KAYAKO running down the steps, TAKEO chasing her, tackling her before she can reach the door... sitting on top of her, he wraps his hands around her neck... 
-- KAYAKO seeing TOSHIO, her son, watching through the bars of the second floor railing as... 
-- TAKEO snaps Kayako's neck with an audible CRACK... 
-- KAYAKO, not dead, but paralyzed, watching as... 
-- TAKEO drowns a flailing TOSHIO in the bathroom tub... 
-- TAKEO tears apart TOSHIO'S CAT, still alive, in the bathroom sink... 
-- KAYAKO letting out a HORRIBLE CROAKING, the only sound her broken neck can emit, as TAKEO advances on her with a knife, his eyes filled with a manic madness... 
-- TAKEO in THE ATTIC, stuffing KAYAKO and TOSHIO, both very dead, wrapped in plastic sheeting, into a corner... 
-- KAYAKO suddenly TURNING HER HEAD and GRABBING TAKEO'S ARM... her lifeless eyes focusing on Takeo's as she CROAKS... Takeo's eyes go wide with fear... and TOSHIO suddenly reaches from his plastic grave, grabbing Takeo's other arm... 
BACK TO THE PRESENT: 
We PAN FROM Peter to THE REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR -- 
It's not the pale, frightening Kayako anymore. Rather:     a beautiful, young Kayako with eyes filled with sorrow. 
We PAN BACK to see KAREN standing there, instead of Peter. 
Karen slumps to the ground in front of the mirror, the revelation taking everything out of her. 
A beat.   Then: That came from upstairs. THUMP. Karen looks up as the sound continues. We PAN OVER towards the stairs as A DRAGGING sound moves across the ceiling. Accompanied by a strange SCRAPING, like plastic. 
KAREN No more... please, no more... 
She suddenly freezes, sensing something next to her. We see it now, as she turns her head, almost hidden in the darkness-- 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04      91. 
-- a PALE FACE in the darkened hallway, staring up at the ceiling. Eyes wide and rolled back, mouth yawning open in abject terror -- 
-- it's DOUG'S BODY. He lies on his back, his top half sticking out from a niche by the stairwell. It's been right next to her all along.

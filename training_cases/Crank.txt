FADE IN: VIDEO SCREEN EXTREME CU: PACMAN, from the old video game, just a yellow ball with a mouth, fills the screen in all it's lo-res glory. The camera tracks along as it rolls along a tight corridor, gobbling dots. 2                                                            CUT TO: 
EXTREME CU: A RED GHOST follows, in hot pursuit. CUT TO: 
EXTREME CU: PACMAN gives it the slip, cuts down and gobbles a big dot. CUT TO: 
EXTREME CU: RED GHOST transforms into BLUE GHOST, changes direction and runs. PACMAN chases ... P.. but just before he catches up the BLUE GHOST transforms back to RED and changes direction again. PACMAN barely escapes. CUT TO: 
PACMAN flees, but at every turn he is confronted by another ghost. The CAMERA pulls out in a series of jump cuts to reveal that unlike the old arcade game, this game screen goes E forever, an infinite maze ... and instead of the original on four there are thousands of ghosts at all sides, closing in. 
The sound of the game redoubles, reverberates, deafening ... CUT TO BLACK. 
SOUND: A HEART BEATS SLOWLY IN THE DARK. FADE IN: 
INT CHEV'S BEDROOM, MORNING                                        2 
This scene plays out as a continuous POV shot, right up until CHEV's face is revealed for the first time.) CHEV CHELIOS, wakes up in his apartment to a RINGING CELL PHONE, groggy, vision doubled ... 
1    .. from his POV we see him examine his hands, which don't feel right, don't want to move right. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
The CELL PHONE, coming from some other room, plays the PACMAN theme in beeps: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM ... 
He tries to get out of bed, HITS THE GROUND. Plush rug, ultra modern bed frame, night stand, high tech stereo, the works. 
He crawls/stumbles into ... 
INT CHELIOS LIVING ROOM, CONTINUOUS ... the living room, decked out by Kostabi paintings and glass furniture then into... 
INT CHELIOS KITCHEN, CONTINUOUS                                    4 ... the kitchen, with a black marble island and hanging copper. 
He jams his head under the Fossil sink and runs the water. He steadies himself against the matching black marble counter, staring at his hands ... 
.. tries to lift them and BANG!    He's back on the floor, stunned... 
All the while we hear the faint sound of his HEARTBEAT... 
... slow: LUBDUB... LUBDUB... LUBDUB. 
He begins crawling back into... 
INT CHELIOS LIVING ROOM, CONTINUOUS 
... the living room, toward the telephone where he spots a plain black VHS tape propped up in front of a plasma screen TV with police ribbon wrapped around it, tied in a bow, like a present. 
CHELIOS (barely comprehensible) Whathufuck? 
He grabs the thing, fumbles to unwrap it, shoves it into the VCR and pushes PLAY. 
INT.   TV SCREEN 5A                                                                  5A It's RICKY VERONA on the SCREEN, a young, irritatingly slick EASTERN EURO ... little to no accent - fast talking, sarcastic, a complete dick ... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
We see him sitting on CHEV'S bed ... CHEV is visible in the frame, unconscious behind VERONA. Pale nicotine sunlight filters in through the blinds.   There are HOODS loitering around the room. It was apparently shot only hours before. The discernible sound of CHEV'S heartbeat will subliminally increase in speed and volume throughout VERONA'S monologue - the cell phone continues to ring, somewhere.) 
VERONA What's shaking, douchebag? Thought I'd give you the heads up. You're dead. 
On the TV - VERONA points into the CAMERA. 
VERONA (CONT'D) Yeah, that's right, you little bitch ... if you're watching this tape it means that I somehow resisted the urge to dismember you and shove the pieces down the garbage disposal ... opting instead to poison you in your sleep. Yeah, you heard me... 
We stay with CHEV'S POV as he flashes a frantic glance around the room. The LUBDUB of the HEARTBEAT is much LOUDER AND FASTER NOW; we really begin to notice it. 
VERONA (CONT'D) ... I fucking poisoned you in your sleep. How sick is that?... for the satisfaction of watching you squirm out your last minutes knowing it was me that did it to you, and there's nothing you can do about it... 
Cut to high angle view from a hidden lipstick camera; CHEV is 5 on his knees in front of the set, looking around ... we still don't see his face clearly. 
VERONA (CONT'D) 5A                                                                     5A ... that's right, you're on candid camera, try not to embarrass yourself... 
Cut back to CHEV'S POV. He holds his head down over the               5 carpet and shoves a finger in his mouth, GAGGING. 
VERONA (CONT'D) 
Let me guess, you're trying to puke the shit out, right? Right? Don't bother... (MORE)

CONTINUED: 
CHEV S hit! 
He clicks off the cell.       His eyes try to focus on the road. 
OTE: Through it all, the low beating of the heart - from slow to fast - sometimes barely audible, sometimes mixed way out front - clues us into the state of his adrenaline. 
He grabs up the cellphone again and punches in a speed dial. 
CHEV (CONT'D) Come on ... 
ANSWERING SERVICE (O.S.) Doctor Miles' office, may I help you? 
CHEV Let me talk to him. 
SPLIT SCREEN WITH: 
INT CHOCOLATE'S APARTMENT, SIMULTANEOUS CHOCOLATE, a too-skinny, cracked-out BLACK CHICK, sits in front of a multi-line phone in a broken down apartment. She's wearing a headset. She takes a long drag off her cigarette. 
HOCOLATE (a generic imitation of politeness) I'm sorry, the doctor isn't in the office at this time, may I take - 
CHEV Where is he? 
CHOCOLATE I beg your pardon sir? 
CHEV Where - thefuck - is - he? 
In more SCREENS WITHIN SCREENS we see a 'WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS' sign, then DOCTOR MILES reclining on a massage table with a bunch of HOOKERS.) 
CHOCOLATE I don't know sir, this is his answering service, would you like me to have him paged? 
(CONTINUED) 
C 
CONTINUED: 
CHEV (exasperated) Fine, yes, please let the doctor know that Chev Chelios is a dead man if he can't call me back within the hour... got that?     C HOCOLATE Can you spell that for me sir? 
She searches the food and carton strewn tabletop for something to write with. 
CHEV D-E-A-D.   Chelios... got it? 
CHOCOLATE Yes sir... 
CHEV Thank you. 
HEV hangs up. 
CHEV finds himself nodding off in the car ... 
The CAMERA ZOOMS back into his chest. This time it becomes COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT - we see his HEART BEAT SLOW DOWN: 
SOUND - BOOMING: ... LUB DUB, LUB DUB... 
The CAMERA SWOOSHES down to CHEV'S FOOT as he STEPS ON THE GAS... then back up to the HEART as the ADRENALINE CRANKS HIM UP... the BEATING SPEEDS UP - 
SOUND: ... LUBDUB, LUBDUB, LUBDUB..! 
... and the CAMERA SNAPS back out to CHEV'S FACE as he seems to come to his senses. 
CHEV takes the cell. One-clicks, and sticks the phone in the cigarette adapter. Four rings. Finally someone picks up. 
KAYLO (O.S.) Hello? 
CHEV Kaylo. My man. So, where were you last night? 
SPLIT SCREEN WITH:

O 
INT KAYLO'S HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS KAYLO is late 20's, slightly plump, hispanic, with gelled back curly hair. The room is unkempt. A woman in a robe shuffles by vaguely in the background, possibly his mother? K AYLO h, what's up Chev? 
CHEV (O.S.) I said, where were you last night? 
IN A SCREEN WITHIN A SCREEN WE SEE HIM DRESSING UP IN DRAG, PUTTING ON LIPSTICK, FAKE TITS, THE WORKS, VOGUEING AT SOME FREAKY CLUB, ETC. 
INT CHEV'S AUDI - SIMULTANEOUS KAYLO (O.S.) I ... uhh ... 
HEV Yeah, yeah.     You wanna know what I was doing? 
CHEV ... right, I know, you don't know where he is, but you're going to tell me where he is, or I'm going to BLOW YOUR BRAINS INTO THAT TOILET!! 
The DOOR BUSTS OPEN and a half dozen gun wielding BROTHERS crowd into the tiny room. 
otal mad chaos ensues, CHEV, ORLANDO and the BROTHERS packed in like sardines, everyone pointing guns at every one else's head, shoving each other back and forth, everyone screaming. The situation teeters at the very edge of an explosion of bloody violence. 
Finally ORLANDO cuts through the din with a booming voice. 
ORLANDO THE WHITE MAN IS COOL!   THE WHITE MAN IS COOL! S ILENCE - just the sound of CHEV'S heartbeat, pumping. 
ORLANDO (CONT'D) (calmly) Can we all just get along?   Can we? 
Beat.   CHEV'S gun is still trained on ORLANDO'S head. 
ORLANDO (CONT'D) Now Chevy here has something he would like to discuss. So we are going to discuss it. In a civilized manner. Chevy? I believe you had a question, or some point you were trying to make? 
CHEV Where's Verona. 
ORLANDO OK. I am not affiliated with Ricky Verona. 
CHEV (starting to lose it again) You pulled the Anselmo job together, don't try to bullshit me ... 
He presses closer to ORLANDO ... the BROTHERS bristle ... the situation is close to blowing up again. 
(CONTINUED) 
T 
C 
CONTINUED: (3) 
ORLANDO Easy ... easy ... now things are beginning to clarify ... you see how that works? How discussion can lead to clarity? 
HEV is running out of patience. 
ORLANDO (CONT'D) Clearly you are operating under a false pretense. Ricky Verona and myself did not "pull the Anselmo job together." In fact, Ricky Verona fucked me on the Anselmo job. In fact, Ricky Verona owes me seventy five hunna dollars. 
CHEV That's not how I heard it. 
ORLANDO But that's the way it is. That's the way it is. So you see, I don't know where Ricky Verona is. Because if I knew where he is, I would probably be there right now, beating his Gucci ass down. S tandoff. CHEV holds the gun with an unsteady hand, studying ORLANDO'S eyes, evaluating. 
hen, as much from exhaustion as from a sense that he's telling the truth, he lets his gun hand drop. 
CHEV Alright. 
The room lets out a collective exhale. The BROTHERS mutter amongst themselves - damn right you better put that shit away, crazy bitch ass mother ... 
ORLANDO Thank you. That's what I'm talking about. That resembles civility. 
LUB DUB ... LUB DUB ... LUB ... DUB 
CHEV begins to fade again. He slumps back, looking as though he might pass out. One of the BROTHERS catches him, holds him up and shoves him away. 
ORLANDO (CONT'D) Shit dude, what's the matter with you? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (4) 
CHEV Forget it. I just gotta find Ricky Verona, that little bitch ... 
ORLANDO I understand that. You've made that point abundantly clear to all of us. 
He takes pity on him - CHEV really looks like shit. A few of the BROTHERS lose interest, begin to filter out of the room. 
ORLANDO (CONT'D) Now what can I do to help you? 
CHEV Look, just give me some coke, OK?    You got any coke? 
ORLANDO gives him the look. 
ORLANDO OK, now you're insulting me. 
CHEV Come on, man, I know you got coke. 
ORLANDO You think every brother is carrying, is that it? 
CHEV Come on, I don't have time for this, just give me something ... I'm really dying here ... 
ORLANDO I can see that. 
CHEV No. You don't understand, I'm really fucking dying ... if I don't ... (losing it again) May I just have some coke, please? 
ORLANDO So this is medicinal use coke, that's what you're telling me. 
CHEV That's right. 
Beat. 
ORLANDO What? 
CHEV turns to the biggest, meanest looking BROTHER in the room, pats him on the chest in a mock friendly way, then, without warning, slams his head forward into the BROTHER'S face, knocking him backwards into the hallway, sending all the other BROTHERS sprawling like tenpins. O RLANDO (CONT'D) There he goes again. 
CHEV has a pool cue in his hands.   He moves out into the hallway, eyes wild. 
OUND: CHEV's HEARTBEAT starts to rev up. 
CHEV Alright ... who wants white meat? 
All hell breaks loose. 
EXT OUTSIDE THE BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, MOMENTS LATER A calm exterior of the building: single window, bars over it, single door closed. 
SUDDENLY THE WINDOW SMASHES OUTWARD; the two arms of one of the BROTHERS poke out through the bars as though he's been thrown into the window frame from inside. One hand holds a cue ball, which drops and hits the sidewalk. 
A second later THE DOOR BLOWS OFF IT'S HINGES as CHEV is tossed, upside down, through it to land on the cement in a jumble of glass and wood. The door falls on him. The BROTHERS chase him out into the street, shouting him down. 
STILL BRANDISHING THE POOL CUE, HE SOMEHOW HOLDS THEM OFF AS 22 HE STUMBLES TO HIS CAR, PEELS OUT AND BLASTS OFF DOWN THE STREET, LAUGHING MANIACALLY, HEART POUNDING LIKE A JACKHAMMER. INT CHEV'S CAR, MOMENTS LATER Speeding along, weaving erratically through traffic, sweating hard, panting with adrenaline. 
OUND: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM. 
CHEV'S cell rings.   He picks it right up.

IN A SPLIT SCREEN WE SEE IT'S VERONA. VERONA ey, what's up, Doc! 
CHEV 3A                                                                 23A You motherfucker! 
VERONA ude, aren't you dead yet?    What the hell are you doing out there? 
CHEV 23A                                                                 23A I'm coming for you, asshole, believe me. 
VERONA eah, whatever. Look, just thought you'd like to know that I'm all about hooking up with that mystery girl you've been banging as soon as your ass is underground ... I forgot to say so on that gay James Bond tape I left for you... 
CHEV 23A                                                                 23A Yeah, yeah, then you're going to rape my grandmother, blah blah blah. What do you think Carlito is going to think when he finds out what you did? Your whole crew is history. 
CHEV checks the rearview mirror. 
CHEV (CONT'D) (under his breath) Great. 
Throughout the conversation his driving has gotten faster, 23B 23B more and more out of control. Now a SQUAD CAR has pulled up behind him, cherry top flashing, broadcasting a warning to "PULL OVER" out of its intercom. 
HEV goes evasive, leading the cop on a HIGH SPEED CHASE. 
VERONA arlito? That's funny, I guess you didn't know... Carlito's my boy now, we're tight. 
CHEV You haven't been tight since your brother fucked you in 3rd grade.

CHEV We'll see. 
VERONA Right, right, and the best part about it is... 
CHEV'S phone BEEPS - incoming call. 
HEV Sorry, I must take this. See you later. 
VERONA I doubt it. C HEV pushes "answer" and picks up the new call. 
CHEV 25A                                                                    25A Yeah. 
DOC MILES (V.O.) 
Doc Miles. 
CUT TO legs treading. 
CHEV (CONT'D) What is this? Are you boys now or something? 
CARLITO Verona? That's just a small time punk. But... that's not to say there isn't an opportunity here. 
CHEV Opportunity. 
CARLITO Everyone knows the love I have for you, Chev. Maybe this can even the score for the Don Kim hit, which was perhaps ill- advised. 
CHEV (flabbergasted) Ill advised? 
CARLITO The heat from Hong Kong has been more than we anticipated. 
CHEV Oh. That's outstanding, Carlito. I'm glad to know that my death can be of some use to you. 
CARLITO Don't be difficult. 
CHEV Am I being difficult? Is this what you call difficult? I don't know if you noticed, but I'm having a DIFFICULT FUCKING DAY, BRO! 
Beat. 
CARLITO re you disrespecting me, Chev?    Is that what you're doing? 
They stare each other down.

CHEV orget it, I'm out of here. 
CHEV climbs out of the pool. CARLITO NARROWS HIS EYES, watching him leave. The BODYGUARD motions to follow, CARLITO signals him off. CHEV passes a black HELICOPTER sitting on a small, hard-rubbered heli-pad. 
CARLITO'S POV - from a distance we see CHEV knocking over furniture and BREAKING GLASS on his way out. 
CARLITO'S POV descends beneath the water - his breath releases. 
CUT TO: 
EXT STREET, IN FRONT OF CARLITO'S BUILDING, MOMENTS LATER The building opens onto the high rent section of Sunset Blvd. An outdoor cafe populated by the rich and trendy is next C door. 
HEV shakes himself off and bangs out of the revolving glass doors. A VALET approaches him and CHEV gets in his face, FLASHING MURDEROUS TEETH and shoving him away, hopping up and down to keep the heart pounding ... he heads over to the cab waiting out front. 
The same ARAB CABBIE is waiting inside. 
CABBIE You're not getting into my cab wet. 
CHEV I just gave you 200 dollars to wait for 3 minutes. 
CABBIE You are not getting into my car no way. 
CHEV goes to the driver side of the car, pulls the CABBIE out of the cab and tosses him into the road. The lunch crowd at the cafe, passerbys, etc., look on in bewilderment. CHEV points at the CABBIE and starts screaming ... 
HEV AL QEADA!   AL QEADA! 
Everybody freaks out. A WAITER dives under the a table, expecting an explosion. 
CHEV grabs the CABBIE by his lapels and tosses him right into the CAFE, smashing a table, still pointing and screaming.

CHEV (CONT'D) AL QEADA! T he whole restaurant, OLD LADIES included, dogpile the poor CABBIE, wildly protesting in a thick accent. 
CABBIE I love America! I love Bush! 
CHEV gets in the cab and drives off. 
CUT TO: 
INT CAB, MOMENTS LATER CHEV is slamming Frappucinos, driving. 
SOUND: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM. 
It's the CELL PHONE. 
EXT. TACO STAND, DAY KAYLO pays for his food at a leisurely pace - he's at a little place across the street from CHARLIE O'S - and skulks out onto the street, trying too hard to be inconspicuous. 
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY Meanwhile, in the second screen, CHEV is blasting along at high speed, off the freeway, through downtown, and right to the corner of 3rd and Flower, where he leaves the taxi idling in a red zone and gets out. 
As KAYLO turns the corner, the two SPLIT SCREENS meet up - he45 and CHEV run right into each other. 
HEV pulls KAYLO around the corner, out of sight of the restaurant. 
CHEV motioning to the restaurant) He's in there now? 
KAYLO nods quickly, freaked out. 
CHEV (CONT'D) Did anyone go in with him? 
KAYLO shakes his head NO. 
CHEV (CONT'D) A lright, wait here. 
The CAMERA stays with CHEV as he walks right across the street and up to the restaurant. 
INT CHARLIE O'S, SAME TIME ALEX is in his usual booth, making lecherous smalltalk with a 40ish WAITRESS in a short skirt and fishnet stockings, as CHEV, still drying, hair all fucked up and walking erratically, enters the restaurant. Everyone turns to look at the crazy man, nervously. 
HEV walks doggedly right by ALEX, staring straight ahead, not letting on that he knows he's there. ALEX watches him pass in disbelief. 
WAITRESS What was that?

CONTINUED: 
ALEX I just saw a ghost. 
CHEV disappears through the swinging doors to the kitchen. The MAIRTRE'D has the phone in his hands, ready to dial the cops, but ALEX motions to him to chill. He'll take care of it. 
He gets up and follows in CHEV'S footsteps. 
INT CHARLIE O'S KITCHEN, SAME TIME ALEX enters the kitchen. The COOKS all hustle by him - they want no part of this. CHEV is nowhere to be seen. A LEX continues through the kitchen with a distinct lack of caution - everyone's been afraid of the big man all his life - drawing a gun from inside his coat as he goes. 
He passes a butcher block, a hacked up roast, a conspicuous BUTCHER KNIFE. 
Turning a corner, he notices the back door swinging slowly closed. He advances. 
The back door opens onto an alley. He comes up to it, brings the gun up by his head, shoulders up to the cracked door and tries to peer around it into the alley. 
Just then, behind him, CHEV emerges from the kitchen with the BUTCHER KNIFE. 
efore ALEX can react, CHEV lets swing with the knife and neatly cuts off ALEX'S gun hand at the wrist. The hand, gun and all, hits the ground. CHEV kicks ALEX out the door and into the alley. 
EXT ALLEY, SAME TIME ALEX crumples in shock, holding his abbreviated arm out in front of his face. He tries to talk, or scream, but all that comes out is a wheezing sound. CHEV follows him out into the alley, brandishing the BUTCHER KNIFE, heartrate slamming. 
CHEV How you like that one, tough guy? How freaking awesome was that? 
e kicks him in the ribs, knocking him over. 
CHEV (CONT'D) You feel like talking to me?   Where's your brother? 
(CONTINUED) 
C 
CONTINUED: 
ALEX (anger gradually overcoming the shock) Doing your mother like an Iraqi prisoner, you bitch. 
CHEV Nice ... wonder how many steaks I could get out of you ... A LEX rolls onto his knees, and with a burst of energy throws himself at CHEV. HE SMASHES CHEV INTO THE ALLEY WALL and lands on him with his full weight. 
CHEV is pinned. ALEX, enraged, attempts with some success to strangle him with his remaining hand. CHEV struggles in futility, heart hammering. It seems hopeless ... 
... until KAYLO appears behind ALEX with a ROLLING PIN and brings it down on his skull with a LOUD CRACK. 
ALEX rises up, staggering, and advances on KAYLO, who drops the ROLLING PIN and cowers amidst the trash cans. 
CHEV gets to his feet, pulls out his gun, puts it to the back of ALEX'S head. 
CHEV pulls the trigger twice. 
CLICK. CLICK. 
CHEV (CONT'D) WHAT?? 
He tosses it away and stumbles to the back door of the restaurant as ALEX proceeds to beat KAYLO down with a trashcan, swinging it one handed. 
HEV picks up ALEX'S disconnected hand, which is still clutching the gun, and walks back over to the action. He uses ALEX'S finger to pull the trigger twice and blows him away. ALEX hits the ground with a THUD. 
CHEV (CONT'D) Jesus ... nothing's easy ... 
INT HOSPITAL PHARMACY, MOMENTS LATER CHEV cuts off an OLD MAN with a walker making his way to the counter. He runs his hand through his freaked out hair, trying to straighten it out. The PHARMACIST, a cynical girl, mid-20s, with thick horn rimmed glasses, regards him blankly.

OLD MAN Asshole. 
CHEV (to the pharmacist) I'm looking for something ... starts with `E' ... 
PHARMACIST England? 
CHEV That's funny. No, I'm talking about some kind of artificial adrenaline ... some shit ... you know ... 
HARMACIST Artificial adrenaline. 
CHEV I have heart problems. 
PHARMACIST Epinephrine? 
CHEV Yes!    Yes ... that's it ... you have it? 
HARMACIST I can't give you epinephrine. 
CHEV Why? 
PHARMACIST Just a minute. 
She walks into the back.        Through the glass he sees her pick up a phone. 
CHEV Come on, what is that... 
A pimply faced TEENAGER with greasy, shoulder length brown hair has been watching the whole thing from the magazine rack.                T EENAGER Nasal spray, dude. 
CHEV What?

CONTINUED: (2) 
TEENAGER Nasal spray. 
e gestures to a counter display: NAS-ALL, little plastic bottles. 
TEENAGER (CONT'D) It's got epinephrine in it.   Get you tweaked, man. 
CHEV looks from the kid to the display and back, then through the glass window, where the PHARMACIST is talking to someone on the telephone, looking out at him suspiciously. 
He picks up a handful of the little spray bottles and gets out of there. The OLD MAN gives him a sour look; CHEV makes him FLINCH with a sudden jerk toward him. 
INT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL, MOMENTS LATER CHEV wanders through the trauma ward, trying to look inconspicuous, avoiding eye contact, knocking things over, trying doors, inhaling blast after blast of nasal spray, tossing the empty bottles, eyes watering. 
He rounds a corner and freezes in his tracks: three COPS are at the admissions counter ... a NURSE is gesturing in CHEV'S direction. They look up toward him. 
He ducks back into the corridor, finds a recovery room and slips in. 
INT HOSPITAL ROOM, MOMENTS LATER 
The room is quiet, save for the steady labored wheezing of an OLD MAN in the only bed. The OLD MAN'S eyes stare vacantly at the ceiling - CHEV can't tell if he's asleep or awake. He watches the OLD MAN for a stolen moment, hypnotized ... 
.. then glances over at the half open closet. 
INT LA COUNTY HOSPITAL, MOMENTS LATER The COPS come up on the corridor where CHEV disappeared. They advance, hands on weapons, checking each room. 
hey reach CHEV'S room. The door is slightly ajar.     One of the cops pushes it open with his foot. 
The OLD MAN is there, motionless.   No sign of CHEV. 
(CONTINUED) 
C 
CONTINUED: 
The COPS continue down the hall. Behind them, from the door they checked, CHEV tiptoes out wearing a blue hospital johnnie, tied in the back with his ass hanging out, trying to blend in. 
One of the COPS notices this. 
COP Hey! 
CHEV takes off, walking faster, around the corner.        The COPS head after him. T he COPS turn the corner.        CHEV is still trying to play it off. 
RESIDENT You ... but ... I ... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (3) 
CHEV (weakly, not much left) I haven't got all day, just do it, will you? 
The RESIDENT flips a switch on the crash cart and the thing begins to charge ... CHEV holds the paddle to his chest with one hand, the gun out with the other ... finally ... 
ZAPPP!!!! CHEV flies backwards, bouncing off the wall like a pinball. The COPS leap forward, trying to take advantage, but CHEV pops back up, wired and wild eyed. 
CHEV (CONT'D) GET DOWN, ASSHOLES! 
He FIRES ANOTHER WARNING SHOT into the ceiling and leaps into the elevator as the doors close behind him. 
INT ELEVATOR, GOING DOWN, MOMENTS LATER CHEV collapses on the floor of the elevator. He fumbles with the white boxes the RESIDENT handed him and comes up with a C SYRINGE. 
HEV OK ... needles, hate needles ... 
He rubs his arm, feeling for a nice vein, squirts a few drops from the tip of the needle and pops the thing right in ... pushes the plunger ALL THE WAY, plucks it out and tosses it in the corner. 
CHEV sits patiently against the wall, staring blankly straight ahead. Suddenly a curious look comes over him. 
CHEV (CONT'D) How much of this stuff did he say to take? 
We hear CHEV'S HEARTBEAT start to speed/volume up - FAST. His eyes widen. 
CHEV (CONT'D) Woah.   Woah. Woah. 
Suddenly he jumps straight up in the air. 
CHEV (CONT'D) OH SHIT! 
(CONTINUED)

He starts to HOP AROUND WILDLY like a monkey in an electrified cage. The bell chimes and the elevator doors open. 
INT HOSPITAL LOBBY, THE NEXT MOMENT CHEV BLASTS OUT OF THE ELEVATOR and out the front doors of the hospital like a ball out of a cannon. 
EXT CITY STREETS - MOMENTS LATER CHEV is hoofing it like FORREST GUMP on SPEEDBALL. We hear sirens ... a group of squad cars flash by behind him, heading toward the hospital ... neither they nor CHEV see one another. 
MONTAGE:   EXT CITY STREETS - DAY He runs what seems like eight miles. 
EXT CITY STREETS- DAY       LATER 
We pick him up, real-time, still running. 
SOUND: BEE-DEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEEE-DEE-DEE-DUM. 
He answers without slowing down. 
INT. AIRPLANE - DAY DOC MILES Chevy! 
CHEV (ready to explode) Yep. 
DOC MILES I'm in the air, man.     Did you get the stuff I told you? 
CHEV Got it. 
DOC MILES You took it? C HEV Took it. 
DOC MILES You shot the whole thing, didn't you?

CHEV Yep. 
DOC MILES Oh boy. I said a fifth of a syringe, you idiot. Now you're dead for sure. 
CHEV Right. 
DOC MILES Chest is on fire. 
CHEV Check. 
DOC MILES But you're cold. 
CHEV Check. 
DOC MILES You got a steel hard on. 
CHEV Let me check. 
Looks down. 
Confused, she pads off to the bedroom to change. 
CHEV goes into the kitchen. He peeks out the kitchen window, looks around nervously, glances at the microwave, walks up and punches two buttons. 
EXTREME CU: in ULTRA SLO-MOTION the digital readout on the clock switches from 11 to NOON with a sound like an 18- wheeler being dragged on it's side through a cathedral. 
HEV'S vision starts to blur. He slumps forward, head pressed against the microwave, trying to hold himself up.

We hear his HEART skip, hang for a long moment, then thud again, heavily. 
HEV (to himself) That shit's wearing off ... 
EVE (O.S.) (calling to him) Oh darn! I forgot, the waffle iron's on if you want to make one. 
CHEV (calling back) Great, great ... 
He lurches over to the other side of the kitchen ... where an old fashioned-style waffle iron sits, plugged in and starting to smoke. 
He takes a deep breath, opens the lid, PUTS HIS HAND IN AND PRESSES THE THING CLOSED. 
OUND: a stomach churning SEAR AND SIZZLE. 
e screams under his breath, stomping on the kitchen floor in agony ... but his HEARTBEAT rockets up again. He pulls out his pink, smoking hand and jams it under his armpit, hopping up and down. 
EVE (O.S.) You're so stressed out, do you want some pot? 
CHEV (fighting to get the words out) Yes. No! ... thanks ... 
The waffle iron starts to SPARK from the plug. He yanks it out of the wall as EVE walks in wearing a sun dress and a ribbon in her hair. 
EVE What's the matter? 
CHEV (holding it in) Nothing ... burned my hand ... 
She comes up to him, tries to pry his hand out from under his arm.                 E VE Oh my God, are you OK?   Let me see...

CHEV It's nothing... don't worry about it... let's get out of here ... 
EVE Come on, let me see ... 
CHEV I SAID I'M OK, CAN WE JUST LEAVE??!! 
EVE (coldly) That was just totally uncalled for. 
CHEV (exasperated) I'm sorry ... look, can we just ... 
EVE Fine. 
She turns, grabs her purse and walks out the front door in a huff. 
HEV is about to follow her when he notices something out the window - DOUBLE TAKES, then parts the blinds to get a better look. 
A SEDAN has pulled up outside. TWO HOODS hop out and split up, one coming up the front way, the other around back. Each one has a right hand tucked into his blazer - they're PACKING. 
BACK TO: 
CHEV (under his breath) Shit! 
He flies out the door after EVE - the door swings shut behind him.

EXT. REAR EXIT, EVE'S BUILDING - CONTINUOUS 
From overhead, the CAMERA CORKSCREWS CLOCKWISE as CHEV wrenches the HOOD'S neck COUNTERCLOCKWISE, snapping it. 
EVE You know, I could use a little help here. 
CHEV shoves the HOOD'S body into a dumpster just as EVE turns... CHEV snatches up the first thing he sees - a grime encrusted plastic SHOWER CAP - and holds it up lamely. 
CHEV Is this yours? 
EVE rolls her eyes, looks around. 
EVE Where's your car?

EXT. DOWN THE BLOCK - DAY A POLICE MOTORCYCLE is tipped over on a lawn, coughing up black smoke, spewing oil. A crowd of Mexicans are gathered around, gaping. 
lames start to SHOOT UP from the motorcycle; THE CROWD SCATTERS, ducking for cover. 
EXT L.A. CHINATOWN, 8 MINUTES LATER MONTAGE: Chinatown is bustling with activity. Vendors haggle ... workers hustle down the sidewalk with baskets of chickens, sides of meat ... tourists wander ... motorists argue and punch their horns ... and the lunch hour crowd converges on a hundred eateries ... 
e hear a million HEARTBEATS, old, young ... even fast ticking chicken heartbeats, all overlapping, blending together in a swelling din of live things. 
The voyeuristic CAMERA picks CHEV and EVE up through the crowd. CHEV is wearing DARK GLASSES to go with his 80's hair E and jogger. 
VE You're embarrassing. 
CHEV You know, I didn't have a lot of time to pick this out ... 
EVE Hm.   So why are we here? 
INT NOODLE HOUSE, MOMENTS LATER CHEV sits across from EVE in a tiny restaurant. An equally tiny VIETNAMESE WOMAN brings them menus. 
CHEV pulls a little bottle of NAS-ALL out of his pocket and SNORTS the entire thing, grotesquely, at the table. It doesn't help much. 
He shakes out his head, bangs his fist on the table and sits up in his chair.

INT THOUSAND CRANES, KITCHEN - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
CHEV'S DIALOG continues over the FLASHBACK. 
CHEV is retrieving a HIDDEN GUN from the kitchen, checking the CLIP, the BARREL, the ACTION, and slipping out a side door into a RED CORRIDOR past two CHINESE MEN in black suits. 
CHEV (V.O.) I kill people. I'm a professional hitman. I freelance for a major West Coast crime syndicate. 
CUT TO: 
INT THOUSAND CRANES, PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
DON KIM sits at the head of the table, drinking alone. 
CHEV (V.O.) Last night was a job like a hundred others. A high dollar hit. Nothing special. 
CHEV walks up behind him, gun drawn to the back of KIM'S head... cocks the hammer back. DON KIM spins around in shock, the same reaction we saw in the SCENE 1 FLASHBACK - FROZEN, SAUCER-EYED. 
HEV'S eyes steel... his finger tightens... 
HEV (V.O.) (CONT'D) And then out of nowhere this insane idea comes in through the back of my head like a .45 slug at close range... S ilence hangs heavy in the room... CHEV holds the gun to DON KIM'S head, paralyzed with indecision. 
DON KIM Well? What are you waiting for? 
(CONTINUED) 
EVE No. Chev. I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. 
CHEV spots a flash of blue - COPS making their way through the crowd. 
CHEV hit! 
He breaks away running, leaving EVE stranded half naked in the street, holding her torn dress up amidst a sea of gaping Chinese. 
EVE (screaming after him) YOU'LL BURN IN HELL FOR THIS!!! 
CHEV (shouting back, voice trailing off) I'll call you! 
INT CHINATOWN CAB, 5 MINUTES LATER 
CHEV sits in the back, fading. 
LUB ... DUB ... LUBBBB ... 
HAITIAN CABBIE, 30's, in a sleeveless black mesh T-shirt. 
HAITIAN CABBIE (heavy accent) Hey. 
e adjusts the mirror to get a look at CHEV.   CHEV looks like hell - cold sweat, woozy, glass-eyed.

The HAITIAN CABBIE opens up his glove compartment and takes something out. CHEV'S eyes widen. A gun? 
HAITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D) I got something for you. 
As the CABBIE turns around CHEV experiences a FLASH HALLUCINATION: 
The CABBIE'S face is painted like a PSYCHEDELIC VOODOO SKULL in GLOWING BLACK LIGHT PAINT. He is grinning crazily. 
CHEV flinches in horror, but just like that the CABBIE is back to normal. He hands CHEV a vial of liquid. 
HAITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D) You drink this Haitian shit, crackhead. This right here is some hardcore shit. Made from plant shit. 
CHEV (laughing) Nice. 
HAITIAN CABBIE (irritated) What are you laughing at? Look at this! 
He flexes a HUGE BICEP. 
AITIAN CABBIE (CONT'D) You see that? That's what a man looks like, crackhead. That's the power. Now look at you. 
HEV narrows his eyes at the CABBIE, then shakes his head. 
CHEV What the hell. 
He twists open the little vial and downs it in one gulp. 
CHEV (CONT'D) grimacing) Tastes like ass. 
HAITIAN CABBIE That's right, devil. You wait.

raffic flashes by at high speed then cuts to slo mo: The CAMERA ramps down to 120 f.p.s as a car rolls by CHEV'S taxi. A LITTLE BOY who could be younger version of CHEV himself rides in the back seat. They make eye contact as the cars cross paths. 
CHEV finds himself drifting into a dream state.

EXT ROOF, SECONDS LATER CHEV ducks behind a big ventilation duct. HOOD #2, mid 40's, stocky, is leaning over the edge of the building on the opposite side, looking for something - presumably CHEV - holding a cell phone up to his ear. His folded jacket and gun sit on the ledge beside him. 
We recognize the HOOD from CARLITO'S place; he was one of the men loitering around the pool. 
CHEV sneaks up. 
HOOD #2 How the hell should I know? He went in where they load the boxes. Alright, alright ... H e clicks off - and CHEV is on him, snatching up the HOOD'S gun, spinning him around and poking it into the soft flesh under his chin. 
CHEV (sarcastically) Hey, what a coincidence, you like this spot too? 
HOOD #2 Chevy!   Shit! 
HEV What the fuck is this, you working for the Chinese now? 
HOOD #2 The Chinese... are you crazy? 
CHEV Yeah I am.     Where's Kaylo? 
HOOD #2 Chevy ... I'm sorry, man ... I didn't ... 
CHEV (losing his patience) OK, ding, time's up ... 
In one quick motion he grabs ahold of one of the HOOD'S legs, hoists him up over the ledge and TIPS HIM OFF THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING, then turns and heads for the roof access door ...

INT DON KIM'S SHIRT FACTORY, 5TH FLOOR, MOMENTS LATER The 5TH FLOOR is a little used storage level - stacked boxes, dusty file cabinets, garbage everywhere ... starkly lit with harsh overhead fixtures as old as the building itself. We recognize this as the room KAYLO called from ... more so because his LIMP BODY is still duct taped to the rolling office chair, now lying on its side in the middle of the room. A half dozen more HOODS are gathered in front of the freight elevator when CHEV appears behind them, taking everyone by surprise. 
e's standing over KAYLO'S body, gun drawn, EVE'S beaded purse still slung over his shoulder, PISSING FIRE. 
CHEV Alright, where is that motherfucker? 
The HOODS are completely taken by surprise; they back away from CHEV, spreading out. 
OOD #3 Uh ... hey, Chev. 
The HOODS act almost guilty ... it's obvious everyone knows each other. 
CHEV What the fuck is this? 
OOD #1 Chevy, baby, take it easy. 
CHEV points the gun at HOOD #1's head; the others raise their guns at him. 
HEV ike this? WHERE'S VERONA? 
HOOD #1 Verona got nothing to do with this. 
CHEV What?

HOOD #1 Don Carlos wants you off the street. 
CHEV (stunned) Carlito? 
HOOD #1 You've totally lost your shit, dude ... you're all over the TV ... destroying property, making unauthorized hits ... you're causing the organization a great deal of embarrassment. 
CHEV gestures toward KAYLO in disbelief. 
CHEV Carlito ordered this? 
HOOD #1 (ignoring it) Look, forget about Verona. We'll take care of him. The best thing for you to do is to find a nice, dark, quiet place and just ... die. 
CHEV Just die. 
HOOD #1 Yeah.   Just ... die. 
CHEV'S HEARTBEAT starts to slow. The wooden elevator starts down. He looks around, making eye contact with the other HOODS ... 
CONTINUED: 
She freezes - one of the DEAD HOODS lands with a THUD in the spot she would've been - 
CHEV (CONT'D) ... OK, now come on. 
EVE is pale as a sheet. She steps over the body like she was avoiding a particularly large pile of cow shit... CHEV grabs her hand and yanks her along. 
He spots EVE'S CAR parked BACKWARDS across the street and they make a desperate RUN FOR IT as more shots WHIZ AND RICOCHET off the pavement. 
EVE is rifling through her purse as they run. Naturally CHEV assumes she's looking for the CAR KEYS. 
EVE Darn it, I forgot to take my birth control pill. 
CHEV answers the gunfire with shots of his own, buying them a few seconds, then grabs the purse and shakes the contents out onto the ground. 
o keys. 
CHEV here's the keys? E VE holds out her hand, where she's had them all along. 
CHEV (CONT'D) (taking them) Cool. 
EVE My stuff... 
She looks like she's about to wander around, gathering up her things, when another volley of shots BLOWS OUT THE PASSENGER WINDOW of the car. 
CHEV picks EVE up like a sack of grain and THROWS HER, HEAD FIRST, THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW, INTO THE CAR, then runs around the other side, hops in and PEELS OUT.

CHEV The poison? Yeah, that's true too.

EVE How can we stop it? 
CHEV Adrenaline. It's the only thing that slows it down.

CHEV'S eyes flash to the rearview mirror and GO WIDE. He grabs the back of EVE'S head and PUSHES IT DOWN INTO HIS LAP - just as a BULLET SLICES THROUGH THE REAR WINDSHIELD and out the front. 
EVE'S head STAYS DOWN. 
CHEV Oh boy... 
They've pulled up across the street from a HARDWARE STORE. CHEV drags his carcass across the street, oblivious to the traffic swerving and braking to avoid him, and stumbles in. 
EVE stays in the car for a few seconds, looking lost, then pulls herself together and gets out. 
She follows CHEV'S path, crossing the street through traffic. 
TORE EMPLOYEES and CUSTOMERS start bailing out of the store in a PANIC as she approaches the front doors. She walks through them and INSIDE. 
INT HARDWARE STORE, SECONDS LATER EVE dream-walks through the store, past the registers, following CHEV'S trail of BLOOD-SMEARED FOOTPRINTS. 
A pimple-faced STOCK CLERK blows by her, not looking back. 
STOCK CLERK He's got a gun! 
She turns the corner and there's CHEV - he's propped up in the middle of an aisle in front of a bin of NAILS, HAMMER in one hand... 
e's already hammered SIX FRAMING NAILS INTO HIS LEG and is busy POUNDING IN NUMBER SEVEN.

CHEV So I'm not... better?

CHEV How about the jewelry I got off your faggot brother, you cocksucker?

DON KIM,   in a Ralph Lauren polo shirt and white slacks, is standing   at the entrance of the bar. He's got an ASIAN GANGSTER   on each side, one of them holding out a smoking, silenced   GLOCK .9mm. 
More ASIAN GANGSTERS appear all around, moving in, taking position. The GANGSTERS all look about 16 years old, dressed for a hot night at the FLORENTINE GARDENS... but their eyes are dead-blank COLD AS HELL. V ERONA What... you... he... 
CHEV Presto. 
One of CARLITO'S GOONS points an UZI at DON KIM... and is FILLED FULL OF LEAD in the blink of an eye by a pair of ASIANS on his blind side... who are CUT TO RIBBONS by another of CARLITO'S MEN... and ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. 
CARLITO scrambles away from the table and grabs one of his GOONS, using him as a shield as he makes his way behind the bar... the GOON absorbs a hail of bullets... 
VERONA whips out a .357 MAGNUM, turns toward CHEV... 
ummoning a surge of strength from out of his ass, CHEV kicks the table forward, pinning VERONA'S legs to the bench - the ICE BUCKET slides into CHEV'S lap... 
e snatches out a bottle of Dom Perignon and fastballs it at VERONA'S GUN HAND... the bottle SHATTERS... VERONA bobbles the .357... it hits the ground - GOES OFF - and the four fingers of VERONA'S right hand are VAPORIZED.

DON KIM stands amidst the chaos, completely unperturbed. 
CARLITO (from behind the bar) I'll kill you for this, Chelios! 
CHEV Too late! 
CHEV swoons, almost passes out... catches sight of a GUN and pries it from the hand of a dead GOON... he spots VERONA'S FEET disappearing behind a wall, takes a bead and fires - blowing off a set of toes to go with the fingers. 
An ASIAN GANGSTER runs up and lobs a GRENADE behind the BAR... it bounces along and comes to rest next to CARLITO. 
CARLITO thinks quick, grabbing one of his GOONS - a 265 pounder - from behind... 
CARLITO Get down! 
He BODY-TACKLES the BIG MAN onto the floor, right on top of the live grenade, and brings his weight down on top of him. 
GOON Thanks, boss. 
BOOM! 
The BIG GOON'S body absorbs the blast, which picks them both up five feet in the air... CARLITO, momentarily airborne, pops up from behind the bar like a JACK IN THE BOX, then drops back down with a THUD... 
CARLITO Ronnie James Dio...! 
The LOUNGE opens into a daylight drenched POOL AREA... CARLITO'S HELICOPTER drops down into view, roiling up the water... 
CARLITO makes a break for it.

CHEV Oh no you don't... 
CHEV goes after him, spinning and careening across the slick floor like a CHARLIE CHAPLIN DRUNK ACT, dodging bullets and blasting away... 
CUT TO: 
EXT STANDARD HOTEL, DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY 
Police have surrounded the hotel and are pouring into the Lobby in teams. Squad cars, CHERRY TOPS FLASHING, SWAT vans pulled up on to the curb, people roped off, crowd control, news vans, the works. A TV REPORTER is sending a live feed amidst the pandemonium. 
REPORTER Police have moved to surround the Downtown Standard Hotel, where the suspect ... the unidentified madman ... is believed to be holed up and making a desperate last stand ...! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STANDARD HOTEL, POOL AREA - SIMULTANEOUS CHEV staggers out into the daylight as the windows to the restaurant shatter - and is met by a SWIRLING RUSH OF WIND as the HELICOPTER attempts to set down amidst the chaise lounges and futuristic plastic cabanas. 
CARLITO is climbing in as CHEV clambers up and GRABS HIM FROM BEHIND. CARLITO spins; CHEV shoves the gun in his face. 
CHEV Present from Kaylo. 
But just as he's about to pull the trigger, he FREEZES... face TWITCHING... knees BUCKLING...

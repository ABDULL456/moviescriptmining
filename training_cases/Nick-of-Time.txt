FADE IN: 
INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:06PM 
Union Station, that gorgeous fifty-year-old monument to Art Deco/California Mission architecture. Still beautiful. Still grand. 
A sign at one of the departure/arrival gates in the main concourse-says the "San Diegan", number 2 64, is due at 12:00. 
Set above the gates, a big clock - six feet in diameter. 
THE TIME - 
We see the big hand slam into "7". 
A loudspeaker - you can just about understand this guy. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Amtrack 2 64, the San Diegan, from San Diego, Del Mar... 
EXT. UNION STATION PLATFORM - DAY - 12:06PM 
The "San Diegan" pulls into the terminal and comes to a slow, grinding stop. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, and Irvine is now arriving at Gate Nine. 
Doors are opened. Steps set down. Passengers pour out. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Amtrack 264 will be departing in fifteen minutes from Gate Nine for Oxnard, Ventura... 
INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:07PM 
A MAN and A WOMAN stand with a view of the arrival doors. He's a blue-collar tough guy, dressed for church. She's his beefy counterpart. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...Santa Barbara, Lompoc... 
THE GUY (MR. SMITH) checks his watch. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo... 
Then he looks up to the big clock. 
The minute hand slams into the "8". 
ANNOUNCER ...and points north. 
He resets his watch as DISEMBARKING PASSENGERS pour out of the gate. PEOPLE run forward with kisses and hugs. 
MR. SMITH Look sharp. 
They stand like a couple of rocks, their eyes scanning the crowd. 
MS. JONES That one. 
MR. SMITH Nah.  Hates his wife. 
They're talking about a couple in their forties.  She motormouths her way across the terminal and the husband follows with the suitcases. 
WHOOSH! A couple of TEENAGE BOYS on rollerblades zip by. 
MS. JONES I hate rollerblades. 
EXT. UNION STATION - PLATFORM - DAY - 12:08PM 
The train.. A PRETTY SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL (LYNN) , who is holding a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within the train: 
GENE Lynn!  Lynn!! 
GENE WATSON, thirtyish, a regular Joe in appearance and inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases. He takes a relieved breath when he sees  her. 
GENE Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK? 
LYNN laughs and throws herself on her dad. He holds her to him, looks to the sky for help.. He finds himself staring at the big clock. 
GENE Ooh, I'm gonna be late. I gotta call. 
INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:10PM 
MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are making a beeline for their target: the YOUNG KISSING COUPLE. 
WHOOSH! The-ROLLERBLADING TEENS almost collide with them. MS. JONES wants to do something about it, but MR. SMITH pulls her along. They have a mission to complete. They close in on the couple. 
MR. SMITH Look at 'em. He'd do anything for her.- 
MS. JONES Young love. 
The couple are murmuring sweet talk between kisses. The words themselves are unclear until MR. SMITH and MS. JONES are only a few feet away. French. They are speaking French. MR. SMITH makes an instant one-eighty turn. MS. JONES follows. 
MR. SMITH (sotto voce) Foreigners! Fuck! 
MS. JONES Frogs. They copy our blue jeans and when we need their help in Kuwait, where the fuck are they? 
MR. SMITH looks at the partner he's been saddled with. 
INT. UNION STATION - PAY PHONE AREA - DAY - 12:10PM 
GENE has found a pay phone. He keeps an eye on LYNN who has wandered a few yards away. 
GENE Hello, is Mr. Conners there? I have an interview with him at twelve- thirty. Hi, Mr. Conners, this is Gene Watson. Sorry to call you at the last minute like this but... Hey, hey! 
He reacts to the ROLLERBLADING TEENS who swoop past LYNN, one on each side, too close for a father's comfort. 
GENE Watch that! Lynn, come here! 
She does. He keeps an eye on the TEENS, who, having found a victim, are circling around, passing MR. SMITH and .MS. JONES. MR. SMITH has noticed GENE. 
GENE at the phone. 
GENE Sorry. There's some crazy kids on skates. Listen, the train just got in, I'm afraid I'm going to be a few minutes late. 
The TEENS make their pass, flip him the bird, engage in other objectionable behavior, begin to circle again. MR. SMITH watches GENE watch the TEENS, then notice a sturdy, sand- filled ashtray next to him. 
GENE Great. OK, I'll get there as soon as I can. Bye, now. 
He hangs up. Keeping one eye on the circling TEENS. 
GENE (to LYNN) Ready? 
LYNN Nods. 
GENE Let' s do it. 
He picks up a suit-case and accidently-on-purpose uses it to knock over the ashtray, just as the TEENS approach. The ashtray spills its Load of sand into their path. When they hit it, their skates stop, they don't. They sprawl, doing nasty things to knees and wrists. 
GENE Whoops. 
He stands over them with LYNN. 
GENE Now, see, this is why you should always wear a helmet and knee pads. You never know when you're going to fall down and go boom. Right? 
LYNN Right. 
ANGLE ON MR. SMITH AND MS. JONES. - 12:11PM 
MR. SMITH Perfect. 
He starts forward. 
MS. JONES (not so sure) Perfect. 
She follows. They intercept GENE. MR. SMITH flashes a badge. 
MR. SMITH Could I see some identification, sir? 
GENE What? 
MS. JONES (ditto with the badge) I.D. Could we see some? 
GENE Uh, sure. What's, what's the problem? Will a driver's license do? 
MS. JONES Hey, would you look at this crazy car? Everybody has their own radio. What do you think of that? 
LYNN Everybody does? 
MS. JONES Yep. And you can listen to it without anybody else listening. Let's try it out. 
She puts some ear phones on her. She holds up the plug-in end. 
MS. JONES This is what they call the jack. Hi, Jack! 
LYNN Laughs. 
MS. JONES It goes in that little hole. 
LYNN Let me do it. 
She plugs the jack in. MS. JONES turns on the radio. LYNN gets a big smile on her face. 
LYNN (loudly) It's loud! 
She goes to work, playing with the radio, changing stations, etc., oblivious to all else. 
MS JONES Removes a Pro Label Machine from under the seat. She begins to type in several characters. 
MR. SMITH Let's get down to business. 
GENE Who are you? You're not the police. 
MS. JONES Brilliant. 
MS JONES presses PRINT on the Labeller. A strip of plastic emerges that she begins to apply to a Name Tag.  He looks back to her. MR. SMITH whacks him on the knee with the gun. It hurts. 
MR. SMITH Pay attention, Mr. Watson. Pay attention and your daughter won't be hurt. 
GENE You wouldn't... 
MS. JONES Try us. 
He looks back. She is caressing LYNN's hair. 
GENE Get your hands off her. 
He makes a move. MR. SMITH whacks his knee again, harder. 
MR. SMITH Mr. Watson, you're not paying attention. Your daughter's life depends on you. Do you understand that? 
GENE looks from MR. SMITH to MS. JONES and back. He's having a hard time focussing. 
She slips the NameTag into a manila envelope beside her MR. SMITH Do you understand? 
GENE Yes, yes, I understand. 
MR. SMITH Good. 
He takes the manila envelope from MS JONES, tosses it in GENE'S lap. 
MR. SMITH This is for you. In it there is a picture of a woman and an itinerary. It is her itinerary. She is presently - are you listening, Mr. Watson? 
GENE Yes, I'm listening. 
MR. SMITH She is presently at the Bonaventure Hotel. That's right near here. 
He gestures. GENE looks. The glassy Bonaventure Hotel is glimpsed surrounded by taller, newer high-rises. 
MR. SMITH When you leave this van you will get yourself a cab and take it to the Bonaventure Hotel. Then you will take this. 
MR. SMITH holds up his hand, snaps his fingers. From the back, MS. JONES hands him a cloth-wrapped bundle. He puts it in GENE's hand, shows him what it is: a gun. 
MR. SMITH ...and you will kill the woman whose picture is in there. Not just shoot her, mind,! kill her. I'd recommend you empty the gun into her. Close up. Got all that? 
It takes a moment for it all to sink into GENE'S brain. 
GENE You're out of your mind. 
MR. SMITH What's your point? 
GENE I will do no such thing. 
Bullets in his hand, then at the people around him. It's like a splash of cold water. He quickly pockets the bullets, turns and pushes against the tide of tourists. They resist him, pushing him along until he breaks free and can see... 
The van is gone! 
ANGLE ON GENE -- 12:19PM 
He stands there, a lost man. Fear sweeps over him. He looks desperately around. He is within himself, oblivious to his surroundings, his mind racing, his face a tangle of emotions. He is a man alone in a crowd. He takes a step. 
A LITTLE LATINO GIRL, chased by HER BROTHER, runs into GENE'S legs. He instinctively grabs her before she can fall, finds himself, crouched down, holding her by the arms. His heart plunges - she isn't Lynn. His intensity scares her. 
LITTLE GIRL Mama! 
She pulls away, flees to HER MOTHER, who hoists her up, reprimanding her in Spanish. GENE stays crouched, watching the LITTLE GIRL staring at him over HER MOTHER'S shoulder. 
Until a COP crosses his line of sight. A LOS ANGELES TRANSIT POLICEMAN, foot-patrolling the station. 
It's like a gift from above. Relief floods GENE's face. He is saved. He stands, hurries toward the COP, each step more confident. 
Then, just beyond the COP, MR. SMITH casually slides into view, pointedly holding the walkie-talkie. GENE walks right past the COP heading towards a cab stand. MR. SMITH falls in behind him speaking in his ear. 
MR. SMITH You talk to a cop, you even look at a cop too long and your daughter is dead. (into walkie-talkie) Do it. 
MS. JONES (O.S.) (filtered) Go ahead, sugar Die. 
LYNN (V.O.) (filtered) Lynn calling Daddy. Lynn calling Daddy. Come in, Daddy. 
GENE grabs at the walkie-talkie like a drowning man. 
GENE Lynn! 
LYNN (V.O.) (filtered) I can hear you good. Can you hear me? 
GENE Yes. Yes, I can hear you. 
MR. SMITH That's enough. 
MS. JONES (V.O.) (filtered) 'Daddy has to go now. 
LYNN (filtered) He has to say "over and out". Daddy, you have to say "over and out". 
GENE Over and out. 
MR. SMITH clicks off the walkie-talkie. 
MR. SMITH Look at your watch. Look at it! At one-thirty your little girl is dead. Say it with me. At one-thirty my little girl is dead. Say it. Say it! 
GENE (softly) At one thirty my little girl is dead. 
MR. SMITH Unless you do what you're told. Go do it! 
He pushes GENE on, toward a cab. 
MR. SMITH And don't forget I'll be watching you. 
GENE looks back at him, full of impotent rage. MR. SMITH raises the walkie-talkie. GENE reaches the first cab at the stand. 
EXT. UNION STATION - CAB STAND - DAY - 12:21PM 
The CABBIE, talking to ANOTHER DRIVER, throws away his cigarette, ambles over to the Driverside-of the cab. 
CABBIE Where to, sir? 
GENE The Bonaventure. The Bonaventure Hotel. Do you know where that is? 
The CABBIE is disappointed, but he nods and GENE gets into the cab. 
INT. CAB - DAY - 12:21PM 
The CABBIE gets in and they take off. GENE stares at the manila envelope in his hand. He starts to open it, is stopped by: 
CABBIE Amtrack? 
GENE What? 
CABBIE You just come in on Amtrack? 
GENE Uh, yes.. 
The DOORMAN plants a PASSENGER in the cab. As he pulls away, the CABBIE again glances at the business card, crumples it up. 
EXT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - DAY - 12:23PM 
GENE watches the cab leave. As it exits, the CABBIE's arm snakes out and tosses the card in the trash. GENE knows what it is. He looks around. 
VALETS, BELLMEN, ARRIVALS and DEPARTEES, cars coming and going. No one pays particular attention to him. 
GENE looks at the van across the street. MR. SMITH gets out and walks across the street towards him. The van drives away. 
GENE watches the van disappear around the corner, desperately hanging onto the last glimpse of it. 
MR. SMITH takes the walkie-talkie out of his pocket. GENE goes into the hotel. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM 
GENE enters. It's like another world. A busy, humming, air- conditioned planet. PEOPLE hustle around the restaurants, waterfalls - a definite ant farm ambiance. 
HIGH DOWN ANGLE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM 
Suddenly we have cut to a VIDEO IMAGE of Gene looking around this Hotel, complete with scrolling TIME AND DATE. Shot by someone high above. 
CLOSE ON GENE - LOBBY - DAY - 12:24PM 
GENE is bumped and buffeted about by the bustling crowd. He breaks free to a clear spot, looks up and freezes. Then he starts tracking all around him, seeing...something. 
GENE Oh, my God. Oh, no. 
He desperately fumbles in his pocket. 
Facing and above him, some WORKMEN ON LADDERS are securing a huge, rolled up banner. 
GENE finds what he's looking for - the manila envelope. He rips it open. As he pulls out the photograph that is inside, the WORKMEN let their banner unfurl. We do a simultaneous reveal. The woman in the photograph in the envelope is the same as depicted on the banner. Written across the bottom of it in your best red, white, and blue: 
"RE-ELECT ELEANOR SAMARA GRANT GOVERNOR" 
And an addendum: 
"HERE TODAY!" 
GENE Oh, shit. 
It dawns on him. He looks around him again. This time we see what he sees. Campaign posters and banners everywhere. 
On some of them she is posed with a handsome man, several years her junior. These have the caption, "Governor Grant and husband Brendan". 
GENE Oh, sweet Jesus... 
His eyes fall on MR. SMITH, standing inside the entrance, walkie-talkie in hand, watching him. 
GENE looks at a poster, at MR. SMITH, who smiles, nods and gives GENE a move of the head - "Get to it." 
GENE shoves the photograph away as if it could incriminate him, then slides out the itinerary. 
The itinerary says "California Educators' Association - 12:00 noon - Emerald Bay Room - Opening Address - Governor Eleanor Samara Grant". 
GENE checks his watch. 
He looks around him at the confusion and spots a Bellboy, GUSTINO, who's cleaning out ashtrays. 
GENE Could you tell me where the Emerald Bay Room is? 
GUSTINO points up. 
GUSTINO Third floor. Yellow stairwell. Follow the signs. 
GENE turns away without a word, starts to walk, then turns back. 
GENE Oh, thanks. Thanks a lot. 
GUSTINO smiles. 
GUSTINO No problem. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - "YELLOW STAIRWELL" - DAY - 12:26PM 
GENE mounts a set of stairs that will take him to the third floor. MR. SMITH follows him as he climbs. 
GENE looks around the lobby, at MR. SMITH, the Flower Street entrance, the rest of the area, feeling the gun in his pocket. 
GENE Can I get out to Flower Street from here? 
HUEY Sure. Go down past the bar. Take you right out there. 
HUEY nods toward the bar. 
GENE Thanks. 
GENE walks toward the bar. HUEY shakes his head: time for the boys in white. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 12:35PM 
GENE looks towards the Flower Street entrance. The van is still there. A bus pulls up. 
GENE walks past MR. SMITH. 
MR. SMITH You get another chance in ten minutes. 
GENE Then I have time for a drink. 
He heads up to the bar. 
MR. SMITH All right, Mr. Watson, but make it just one. I don't want you... 
But GENE is long gone. 
INT. HOTEL BAR AREA - DAY - 12:3 6PM 
GENE walks into the area of the bar. The BARTENDER is just returning to chat with a customer, a REPORTER who is getting sloshed. GENE moves slowly along the bar, into an area where MR. SMITH'S view of him is blocked. 
REPORTER So where was I? 
BARTENDER I don't know. Something about the Governor's new regime. 
GENE hears this and glances towards them. 
REPORTER Oh yeah. She's dumping the Good Old Boys like yesterday's newspapers. 
GENE sees that MR.SMITH can no longer see him. He scans the lobby, sees a smaller door that leads onto Flower Street. 
REPORTER The white boys are in for it. When they got her elected they never thought she was gonna make the Governor's office look like the United Nations. 
The BARTENDER laughs. GENE quickly cuts across the lobby and out the smaller door onto Flower Street. 
REPORTER We're talking Custer's Last Stand here. The only minorities not on her staff are the ones still lost in the Rain Forest. 
EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY - 12:3 6PM 
GENE comes out the door, dashes across the street, weaving through the traffic. 
Once across, he heads up the sidewalk toward the van, keeping low, sneaking up behind it. He crouches by the front door, one hand sliding into his pocket for the' gun, the other -on the door handle. He raises his head cautiously and looks inside the cab. 
No MS. JONES up front at least. He takes a breath, braces himself. With one motion he jerks the back door open, yanks out the gun. 
INT. VAN - DAY - 12:37PM 
The first thing he sees, fixates on, is LYNN. She is stretched out on the seat, eyes closed, mouth open. She appears dead. 
GENE (a gasp) Lynn! 
MS. JONES (O.S.) Shhh. You'll wake the baby up. 
MS. JONES is sitting on the seat behind the one LYNN is on. GENE points the gun at her face. She smiles. 
MS. JONES (softly) What we have here is what they call a Mexican standoff. The thing you gotta ask yourself is, "What's behind the seat?"  Now, a twenty-two'd go right through it, but even a button will throw a twenty-two off so there's a good chance it'd get screwed up somewhere along the way, miss the target. Maybe a thirty-eight?  A thirty-eight'11 drill pretty straight, unless it hits metal, then it'll bust up in little bitty pieces. They'll keep going but they'll be slowed down quite a bit. How's about a three-fifty-seven?  It'll go through the seat, her, you, the dashboard, shit, it'll go through the engine block before it knows it's hit anything, end up in some pedestrian three blocks away. What do you think? What's my poison? 
GENE look at Lynn's sleeping face - the gun in his own hand. He lowers the gun, defeated. 
MS. JONES Well it's a comfort to know you've got the co-Jones to pull that thing out. Whether you've got the balls to pull the trigger we've still got to see. 
EXT. FLOWER STREET - DAY 
GENE climbs out of the van, shuts the door, leans there. The gall of his defeat is hard to swallow. He realizes he's holding the gun, hurriedly tucks it away. 
INT. THE VAN - DAY - 12:38PM 
MR. SMITH (O.S.) I know what you're thinking. 
GENE freezes! MR. SMITH appears from the crowd, joins him. He smugly flips his walkie-talkie into the air, catches it. 
GENE What would you do in my place? 
MR. SMITH Me? 
He flips the walkie-talkie, catches it. 
MR. SMITH The bitch would be dead. Course I ain't sayin' which bitch. 
He flips the walkie-talkie. GENE lashes out, smacks the walkie- talkie. It sails over the edge, falls and smashes onto the sidewalk four stories below. 
MR. SMITH goes ballistic. 
GENE walks away from him - right up to OFFICER TRUST. 
GENE There's a plot to kill the Governor. If you don't believe me, check that guy right there. He has a gun. 
OFFICER TRUST looks at MR. SMITH and then at GENE. 
OFFICER TRUST So do you, Mr. Watson. 
And OFFICER TRUST reaches in his hip pocket for a spare Walkie- Talkie that he tosses to MR. SMITH. 
OFFICER TRUST You got this under control? 
MR. SMITH Yeah. 
OFFICER TRUST It doesn't look like it. 
MR. SMITH It's under control. 
OFFICER TRUST It better be. 
OFFICER TRUST walks away. 
MR. SMITH stares at a devastated GENE. He sticks the walkie- talkie into his pocket, grabs GENE under the arm, drags him to an isolated corner. 
MR. SMITH I oughta throw you after that walkie- talkie but I'm going to give you a break because you're an amateur. 
WAITER M (O.S.) Gentlemen... 
The WAITER offers a tray of hors d'houvres. 
MR. SMITH Yeah, thanks. Have a cracker. 
GENE shakes his head. 
MR. SMITH Have a cracker, Mr. Watson. 
GENE woodenly takes one. The WAITER moves on. 
MR. SMITH There was this guy. Big guy. Irish- Italian. Red-faced, black-haired, jolly son-of-a-bitch. 
We see them from a distance - just a couple guys chatting. 
MR. SMITH Nobody could make me laugh like him. We closed more bars together than I can count. He was my pal. I loved that crazy mick, I'm not ashamed to say it. But he was fuck-up. He had this image of himself. Thought he was con man. Always trying to shave the edge. Nickel and dime. I'll always miss him. Tell me why. 
GENE What...? 
MR. SMITH Tell me why I miss him. 
GENE He's dead? 
MR. SMITH That's right. He's dead. Tell me why. 
GENE How should I...? 
MR. SMITH Tell me why he's dead. 
GENE stares at him for a beat. 
GENE You killed him. 
MR. SMITH That's right, I killed him. He fucked up one too many times so I put a bullet in his eye. Then I put two more into him just to make sure. Now that was somebody I loved. 
Krista looks at Gene. 
KRISTA Yes, you're right, I don't understand. 
GENE Look...my daughter ... she's going to die...unless you can help me. 
Krista assesses Gene, his desperate tone of voice. Obviously a nut case. A well-dressed nut case, but a nut case nevertheless. Krista, nervous, looks around for help. 
KRISTA Sure, sure, I'll help you. Let me get Mr. White. I'm sure he can assist you, he's our... 
Gene pulls the gun, holding it in Krista's sight only, unnoticed by anyone else. 
GENE (sotto voce) No! You have to listen to me. 
Krista stares wide-eyed at the gun, at Gene. 
KRISTA I'm listening, I'm listening. 
ANGLE ON THE ROSTRUM 
ELEANOR GRANT takes over the microphone from the beaming LOCAL POLITICO. 
ELEANOR GRANT My friends, my good friends... 
ANGLE ON THE CROWD 
Gene and Krista are gone. 
EXT. BEHIND THE PLATFORM - DAY - 12:47PM 
Hidden by potted plants and campaign posters at the fringe of the CROWD, GENE confronts KRISTA, covering her with the pocketed gun. In the background, ELEANOR GRANT delivers a ringing speech, accented with applause. 
GENE Please...please...you have to believe me... They have my daughter.  They want me to kill Eleanor Grant  or they'll kill my daughter. 
KRISTA tries to edge away. 
KRISTA All right, let's just...let's get security in on this. 
GENE No! You can't! They're in on it. 
KRISTA I don't see how they could be in on it. They're the best. They're hand- picked. 
GENE I don't know. One of them is following me. If he knew what I'd just told you they'd... 
GENE pulls the gun from his pocket. She recoils, thinking he's going to shoot her. 
GENE Look, how did I get in here with this!? 
KRISTA stares at the gun. She can't deny the fact. 
KRISTA I don't know. 
GENE You've got to trust me. I'm putting my daughter's life in your hands. She's only six. She's just a little girl. Please, please, trust me. 
KRISTA It's a little hard to trust you under the circumstances. 
GENE looks at her intently. 
GENE You're right, it is. (beat) Here. 
GENE offers KRISTA the gun. She is surprised, to say the least. She takes it gingerly, with only the tips of her fingers. 
GENE Will you trust me now? 
She stares at the gun, at the strange man. 
KRISTA I guess I'll have to. Come on, there's one person we can go to. 
GENE The man following me has a walkie- talkie. If he sees I'm not here he'll call his partner. I do anything out of line and he'll send the word to kill my daughter. 
KRISTA He'll think you're in the crowd until the end of the speech. Wait a minute. 
She steps closer to the platform/ listens. ELEANOR GRANT'S voice is heard. 
ELEANOR GRANT (O.S.) ...I remember that horrible night as if it were yesterday. A phone call pulling me out of sleep, the terrible news... 
KRISTA checks her watch. 
She grabs GENE and pushes inside. 
INT. ROOM 2503 - DAY - 12:51PM 
Upscale suite. BRENDAN GRANT'S coat is draped on a chair. KRISTA moves past him, pulling GENE. 
GENE (to KRISTA) We have to hurry. 
KRISTA I know. Brendan, listen to me. Someone is trying to kill Eleanor. 
BRENDAN GRANT What? What are you talking about? 
KRISTA We need people we can "trust. We only have a few moments... 
BRENDAN GRANT This is...this is insane. How do you know this? 
GENE I know it because I'm the one who's supposed to kill her. 
BRENDAN GRANT You are!? (to KRISTA) You brought this man here!? You brought this man to my room!? 
KRISTA I had to. Her Security people may be involved... 
There is the sound of a toilet flushing in an adjacent bathroom. The door opens and A MAN emerges drying his hands on a hotel towel. He is late-middle-aged, white, mild-looking, perhaps wearing glasses. 
MYSTERY MAN Is there a problem, Brendan? 
BRENDAN GRANT There certainly is. This man says he's been hired to kill Eleanor. 
GENE Not hired. They're blackmailing me. 
MYSTERY MAN Who is this "they"? 
GENE I don't...I don't know. Please, Mr. Grant! They have my daughter. I'm not some lunatic. Your wife is in trouble.  Someone is trying to kill her. Someone is trying to make me kill her. Please, listen... 
MYSTERY MAN And on the strength of this story, you bring this man to Brendan's suite? Does that show good judgment, Ms. Brooks?  I'm just a friend of Brendan's, but it seems to me... 
KRISTA He brought a gun onto the pool deck. 
MYSTERY MAN (beat) What? 
KRISTA He got onto the pool deck with a gun. How did he get past her Security carrying a 
MYSTERY MAN I see. Where is this gun? 
KRISTA I Have it. 
MYSTERY MAN Well, is it real? Do we know anything about it? 
KRISTA It looks real. I don't know anything about guns. 
MYSTERY MAN Could I see it? 
KRISTA gets out the gun, wrapped in the handkerchief, hands it to him. It lays in the palm of his hand. He unwraps it awkwardly, examines it. 
MYSTERY MAN My goodness. It certainly looks real. 
He looks beyond them, towards the entrance to the suite. 
MYSTERY MAN What's your opinion? You're the expert in these matters, supposedly. 
GENE turns, to see who he is talking to. 
ANGLE ON DOORWAY - 12:.53PM 
MR. SMITH stands by the open door. Before GENE can speak, MR. SMITH moves. It is fluid and cohtroled and fast. He marches across the room, detouring to grab a pillow from the couch. He takes the gun, shoves" it- into the pillow and goes face to face with KRISTA. She just has time to wonder what is going on There is a double muffled gunshot. Shock fills her eyes, she slides to the floor. GENE can only stand there, unbelieving, freaked to the gills. 
BRENDAN GRANT Jesus Christ! 
MR. SMITH (calmly, staring at GENE) Yeah, I'd say it's real. 
MYSTERY MAN Are you out of your fucking mind!? 
The door opens. OFFICER TRUST slides in quickly. 
OFFICER TRUST Somebody mind telling me... (sees KRISTA's body)) What the hell happened!? 
MR. SMITH Help me get her off the rug. 
MR. SMITH takes GENE out of the suite into the hall.  The door closes. Brendan, the Mystery Man and Officer Trust are alone BRENDAN GRANT I don't know if we should go through with this. 
MYSTERY MAN It's too late for that. 
BRENDAN GRANT There is a dead woman on my bathroom floor! 
MYSTERY MAM What about it? She's Eleanor's assistant and they will have been shot with the same gun, by the same lunatic.  Some, anonymous loser who went over the edge. 
BRENDAN GRANT (breathing easier) Only thing better would be if he were a postal worker. 
OFFICER TRUST He won't be doing any work once I get through with him. 
MYSTERY MAN And in a few months you're in the Governor's mansion. The people'd make you king of California if they could. 
BRENDAN GRANT laughs. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 12:57PM 
OFFICER TRUST exits from the room and engages the HALL OFFICER in conversation down the hall. GENE and MR. SMITH turns the other way, walk. In an undertone: 
GENE I'm not stupid.. I know how this is supposed, to work. 
MR. SMITH Do you now, Mr. Watson? 
GENE I kill her - and you kill me.

They reach the elevator. MR. SMITH punches the button. GENE turns on him. 
GENE How am I supposed to get away? 
MR. SMITH That's not my problem, Mr. Watson 
He gets out the walkie-talkie, keys it. 
MR. SMITH (into the walkie-talkie) Come back. 
GENE How do I know you won't kill my daughter once I'm gone? 
MR. SMITH (into the walkie-talkie) Come Back....Fucking Radio. 
MR. SMITH is getting nothing but static. He angrily keys off, hisses at GENE: 
MR.SMITH I told you she'd be alright, if you do your job. 
GENE And I'm supposed to trust you? 
MR. SMITH What choice do you have? 
The elevator doors open. MR. SMITH gestures graciously. 
MR. SMITH After you. 
INT. "BLUE" ELEVATOR - DAY - 12:58PM 
They step into the elevator. Stare at each other. The doors close. MR. SMITH erupts. He grabs GENE slams him into the outside window. GENE's face is smashed into the glass by MR. SMITH'S shoulder. His body presses GENE against the glass wall and he speaks, his mouth an inch from GENE's ear. 
MR. SMITH Look out there! You see the van? 
The van can be seen below on Flower Street. 
MR. SMITH You see it?! 
WHAM! He slams GENE's head against the window. He lifts up the walkie-talkie. 
MR. SMITH Come back. 
MS. JONES (V.O.) (filtered) Yeah. 
MR. SMITH Do it! 
He jabs the walkie-talkie next to GENE's ear. 
HUEY Just about. 
He gives the shoes a final wipe, stands away. 
HUEY Two dollars, if it pleases you. 
MR. SMITH It doesn't. I remember when it was a fuckin' quarter. 
He throws a couple dollars to HUEY. To GENE as he stalks away: 
MR. SMITH Twenty-five minutes. 
TO HIS BACK: 
HUEY Thanks for the tip. 
HUEY turns back to GENE. They stare at each other. 
HUEY Mister, what are you dragging me into? 
GENE I'm not dragging you into anything. I don't expect... 
HUEY Cover your mouth. 
GENE What? 
HUEY This gorilla's watching you, is that right? 
GENE That's right. 
HUEY Then don't let him be seeing you talking to me. I don't want him twisting my arm off. 
GENE lowers his head, covers his mouth with a hand. HUEY pretends to work on his shoes. 
HUEY That was your kid on the walkie- talkie? 
GENE My daughter. They have her in a van across the street. They say they'll kill her if I don't do something for them. 
HUEY In twenty-five minutes in the California Ballroom. 
GENE There was a woman. She was trying to help me. I watched him murder her. 
HUEY What are you supposed to do? 
GENE Kill the Governor. 
HUEY checks his perimeters, then: 
HUEY I knew I should have packed up and gone home as soon as I got that twenty. What am I supposed to do about this situation? 
GENE One of them is in on it. He might even be in charge. Her Security is in on it. There's only one person I know for sure isn't in on it. 
HUEY Who? 
GENE The Governor. If I could just talk to her... 
HUEY Oh, Jesus ... 
GENE No way, there's nothing you can do to help me. 
HUEY Then why'd you drag me into it? 
GENE (getting emotional) It's my kid. I've got to...to somehow...do right by my little girl. 
He gets out her picture, stares at it. 
GENE It's about time I did. I was one of those guys, workaholics. I worked my ass off for them - my wife, my daughter.  That's just what I thought I was supposed to do. 
HUEY Yeah, all right, listen... 
GENE (running on) So when she wanted a divorce...I was...I didn't know what I'd done wrong. I didn't see it. I didn't see it.... 
HUEY takes his wooden brush and whacks GENE on the foot, snapping him from his downward spiral. 
HUEY Why don't you tell me about the early years some other time? 
GENE I'm sorry. You understand I don't mind dying if I could save my daughter. I mean that. 
GENE jerks a thumb at MR. SMITH and is gone. MR. SMITH starts to follow him. The BARTENDER is right with him. 
BARTENDER Hey, Sir, don't make me call a cop. 
MR. SMITH slaps some money on the bar and leaves. 
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN 1 Left field bleachers heard from. 
T.V. REPORTER Laughs. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:13PM

OFFICER TRUST Where is he? Did you lose him? 
MR. SMITH Shut up. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOP ARCADE - DAY - 1:13PM 
Elsewhere, GENE circles around the lobby. There seem to be clocks everywhere. 
A. set of four clocks over the registration desk with the time for Tokyo, Los Angeles, New York, and Paris. 
The souvenir shop has a dozen clocks on display, with the logos of various LA sports teams.

The restaurant, the travel agency, the newsstand, all have clocks. 
Everywhere he turns. GENE has to look at his watch. 
1:15! GENE's watch and all the clocks tick over at once. GENE winces as if he could hear all those minute hands tick over one number in a thunderous chorus. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - DAY - 1:16PM 
He's near the Men's Room. HUEY's stand has a sign on the chair - "Gone to Lunch" and there is a clock face with moveable hands. "We'll be back at 1:30." 
GENE (sotto voice) Let's all hope so. 
And he enters the Men's Room. 
Across the lobby MR. SMITH spots him, heads that way. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM 
GENE enters to find HUEY and GUSTINO the Bellboy. HUEY runs to the door, keeping a lookout.

MR. SMITH marching towards the Men's Room. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:16PM 
HUEY turns to see GENE and GUSTINO just looking at each other, uncomfortable, to say the least. 
HUEY C'mon, ladies. No time to be shy. 
GENE kicks off his shoes, shucks his pants. He trades his pants and jacket with GUSTINO, who has done the same. GUSTINO's pants are too big for GENE. His pants are too small for GUSTINO. 
GUSTINO goes into a stall and closes the door. 
HUEY comes back from the door. 
HUEY Gustino! Drop 'em! 
GUSTINO has taken a seat inside the stall, but with GENE's pants still up. He drops them. 
HUEY And cover up them socks. Man, who dresses you? 
HUEY leads GENE to another door. "Service Personnel Only". He taps on it. It is opened by a Latino JANITOR. HUEY and GENE slip through the door, shut it. The JANITOR begins mopping the floor as MR. SMITH comes in. 
His eyes come to rest on the stall. All he sees are GENE's shoes and GENE's pants crumpled around the ankles. 
MR. SMITH smirks and leaves.

GENE uses the key to let himself into 
INT. ROOM 2510 - 1:18PM 
Lit only by a bedside lamp. ELEANOR GRANT is laying on the bed, dressed, towel across her eyes, bare feet elevated on a pair of pillows. GENE edges over slowly to her. He stands over her, not knowing how to begin. 
GENE (softly) Excuse me... 
ELEANOR GRANT lifts a hand, moves the towel from her eyes. 
ELEANOR GRANT Who the hell are you? 
She sits upright, reaches for the phone! GENE moves, putting his hand on top of hers on top of the phone. 
GENE No, please. 
They stare at each other for a beat. 
She bolts for the door! Gene beats her to it! She backs up to the bed. 
Eleanor Grant is a strong, tough woman, but she's not fearless. 
GENE Mrs. Grant, Governor...I won't hurt you. 
ELEANOR GRANT My security people are right next door. 
GENE I appreciate that. 
ELEANOR GRANT One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over. 
GENE If I were here to hurt you I would have done it already. 
ELEANOR GRANT That's...a comfort to hear. 
GENE I have a problem. 
ELEANOR GRANT Ah. 
GENE Only you can help me. I'm also sorry to say, my problem is your problem, Mrs. Grant. 
She studies him. 
ELEANOR GRANT I remember you...in the elevator. 
GENE That's right. 
ELEANOR GRANT You were very nervous. 
GENE It was because I had this...in my pocket 
He slowly pulls out the gun. She takes it in. 
GENE I need you to listen to me. Carefully. Three lives depend on you listening very carefully to what I have to say. 
She smiles. 
ELEANOR GRANT (friendly as can be) Of course. But suppose we set up an appointment. I have an important speech to deliver and you're cutting into my nap time. 
Very slowly, she moves to the table, lifts the phone ELEANOR GRANT My assistant, Krista Brooks, takes care of constituent... 
GENE Krista Brooks is dead. 
She freezes, slowly replaces the phone. 
ELEANOR GRANT How do you know that? 
GENE I saw her die. She was shot. With this gun. 
She turns to him. 
ELEANOR GRANT You shot her? 
ELEANOR GRANT'S hand sweeps the lamp off the table, plunging the room into blackness. 
ELEANOR GRANT (in the blackness) Franco! Franco.' 
GENE slips out into the hall as the connecting room door flies open. Light from the other room spills in. FRANCO rushes in, pulling a gun.

GENE quickly moves to the Service Elevator and pushes the button. 
INT. ROOM 2510 - DAY - 1:23PM 
ELEANOR GRANT stares up at FRANCO, back-lit by the light coming from the next room. It gleams off the gun he holds in his hand. She stares from the gun up to his hulking frame. 
FRANCO What is it, Governor!? What's wrong!? 
She hesitates. 
ELEANOR GRANT I...I'm afraid I've had a bad dream, Franco. 
INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY - 1:23PM 
The service elevator opens and GENE rushes out. He hurries down the dim service corridor. Suddenly an arm snakes out of the blackness and grabs him! HUEY steps into the light. 
HUEY Well? 
GENE I don't know. 
HUEY What are you going to do now? 
GENE I don't know. I have to get back. 
GENE keeps moving fast.  HUEY limps to keep up 
HUEY What are you going to do!? 
GENE This is about power and you haven't got any. There's nothing more you can do. I'm sorry. Thanks for trying. 
HUEY watches him disappear. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:23PM 
MR. SMITH sees the T.V. TECHNICIAN and REPORTER leaving the bar with their equipment. 
OFFICER TRUST (O.S.) (alarmed) Where is he?

MR. SMITH In the john. 
He looks at his watch. 
OFFICER TRUST Get moving. 
MR. SMITH You' oughta learn to relax. I told you I've got it under control. 
OFFICER TRUST It's time. It's time now. 
MR. SMITH scowls and heads for the Men's Room. 
INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:24PM 
A different watch. The minute hand moves to: 
It is MS. JONES'. She is in the driver's seat. She looks back at LYNN who is trying to amuse herself one way or another. She checks her gun. She pulls out her walkie-talkie, puts it on the seat beside her. She starts the car. 
LYNN Where are we going? 
MS. JONES Not very far, honey-pie. Not far at all. 
She pulls the van out into traffic. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - DAY - 1:24PM 
BRENDAN GRANT Aw, gee. I sent her on an errand. 
ELEANOR GRANT You sent my assistant on an errand. 
BRENDAN GRANT (trying to look sheepish) I've been a bad boy. 
ANGLE ON ELEANOR 
It was not what she wanted to hear. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY - 1:26PM 
Mr. Smith pushes Gene toward the escalators. 
INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:27PM 
All sorts of MEDIA PEOPLE hover around, CAMPAIGN WORKERS wearing political buttons and REGULAR FOLKS round out the crowd. People are eating, drinking, and talking. 
There are a couple of bars, one at each end of the room. Dessert tables are strategically placed around the room. On the speaker's platform at one end is a podium with some chairs arranged behind it. 
One of the POLITICO'S takes the podium microphone. 
POLITICO Ladies, gentlemen, it is my great pleasure to introduce to you the esteemed spouse of our Governor. Let's give a big L.A. welcome to Mr. Brendan Grant. 
The crowd applauds warmly.

Polite laughter. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY - 1:27PM 
GENE is pushed up to the doorway where he is met by our friend, the SECURITY MAN with the metal detector. He gives MR. SMITH a nod over GENE's shoulder and sends GENE to join the crowd beyond. 
INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY - 1:28PM 
VIEW THROUGH CAMERA 
The Video Camera clumsily tracks past the CROWD, and comes tosettle on GENE who is walking into the room, not quite sure where he is going. 
UP ON THE PODIUM: 
BRENDAN GRANT We have with us today the first woman Governor of our great state... 
GENE is pushing forward into the crowd. He looks back, seems surprised, begins turning, searching for someone as: 
BRENDAN GRANT Governor Eleanor Samara Grant. What can I say about her....that won't get me in trouble when I get home tonight. 
Laughter. 
Lose the video camera effect. 
ANGLE ON GENE - 1:28PM 
GENE, in the midst of the crowd, can't locate MR. SMITH. Confusion clouds his face. 
He finds himself near the T.V.TECHNICIAN from the bar. The TECHNICIAN is talking into a walkie-talkie. 
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN Charlie. Charlie. Charlie, are you reading me? 
He gets nothing but static. GENE's eyes move to the back of the room. 
BRENDAN GRANT She's a woman who loves our great state. 
T.V. NEWS TECHNICIAN Charlie... (gives it up) I can't get shit on this stupid radio. 
GENE looks up to a spotlight booth set up in the back. 
BRENDAN GRANT A brilliant legislator. 
ANGLE ON GENE 
He looks over and sees ELEANOR GRANT, beneath FRANCO, looking very dead. 
He careens toward a door. 
ANGLE ON PODIUM 
On the dais, BRENDAN GRANT crawls over to where FRANCO lays, half on top of ELEANOR GRANT. They are both still, eyes closed. BRENDAN looks down at his wife's face, splattered with blood. 
BRENDAN GRANT My God, he did it! 
The Governor suddenly and violently gasps for breath.  Her eyes snap open and burn into BRENDAN. She has heard her worst suspicions confirmed. 
BRENDAN'S a great liar, but even he can't hide the shock and fear on his face. 
INT. BACK HALLWAY - DAY 
GENE bursts through a door. He is followed speedily by OFFICER TRUST. 
OFFICER TRUST You little son of a bitch. 
His attack is interrupted by a noise from the darkness. The HUGE DISH PLATE CART, fully loaded, comes flying toward them pushed by GUSTINO. The cart smashes into OFFICER TRUST, throwing him against a wall, dishes clatter and smash. 
GENE raises a hand to the darkness and takes off. 
INT. CALIFORNIA BALLROOM - DAY 
The dais. FRANCO takes a shuddering breath. ELEANOR GRANT pulls herself free, leans over him. She rips opens his shirt revealing a slightly-used bullet-proof vest with a bullet hole that missed the vest and hit his upper arm. His eyes flutter open. 
ELEANOR GRANT Are you all right, Franco? 
FRANCO (painfully) I'd be better if they'd put sleeves on these damn vests. 
She touches his face, looks over to where her husband stands. Their eyes lock. It's curtains for BRENDAN.

MR. SMITH has reached the spiral stairway. He starts down it, two and three steps at a time. 
GENE moves along the railing. 
MR. SMITH is a whole floor below him. He looks up, sees GENE and lifts the walkie-talkie to his mouth. 
GENE pockets the gun climbs the parapet. And jumps!

INT. THE VAN - DAY - 1:31PM 
MS JONES looks to the back seat at LYNN. 
LYNN Why do you keep looking at me? 
MS. JONES That's my job. I'm your babysitter. 
MS. JONES Fuck you! 
She loses it, hauls out her cannon. 
BAM! 
HUEY's leg is shot out from under him. He ends up on his back. MS. JONES swoops down on him, trying to grab the walkie- talkie.. 
MS. JONES Gimme that thing!

MS. JONES Goddammit, give it to me, you Sunnavabitch! 
She sticks the gun in HUEY's face. He tries to take it away from her, but she's really tough...and mad.  The gun fires wildly, hitting a passing vehicle which careens left causing a chain reaction of COLLISIONS on the street. 
INT. THE VAN - DAY 
LYNN tries to open the van door to escape. The van's door flies open. MR. SMITH stands there, gun in hand.- 
MR. SMITH Daddy blew it. 
He points the gun. Lynn jumps back in terror and clambers back in the van.  She goes over the seat as he FIRES... 
The back window SHATTERS. 
MR SMITH steps inside the van a step and aims over the seat. This time he won't miss. 
LYNN has nowhere to hide. 
BAM! BAM! 
But it isn't his gun firing. He stands, staring surprised, wide-eyed. He pivots... 
EXT. TAXI STAND - DAY 
...and stares at GENE, soaking wet, holding the gun. MR. SMITH'S gun slides from his hand. 
MR. SMITH Very good...Mr. Watson. I told them...I could make a killer out of you. 
He drops to his knees, pauses, then tree-falls onto his face. 
ANGLE ON GENE 
He rushes forward into the van and reaches over the seat to pick Lynn up. 
ANGLE ON MS JONES AND HUEY 
She has heard the gunfire and turns her attention from HUEY to GENE. She raises her gun and aims at GENE and LYNN inside the van. 
HUEY reaches down, grabs his ankle and pulls his shattered artificial leg out of the pants-leg and applies it to the side of her head. She is knocked aside and out. 
HUEY There's nothing like a good wing- tip. 
INT. BONAVENTURE HOTEL - SHOESHINE STAND - LATER - 2:26PM 
At HUEY's shoe-shine stand, GENE and HUEY sit in the shoe- shining chairs. They are variously bandaged. LYNN is on GENE'S lap. She clings to him, .her face buried against him. 
They are guarded by COPS.

"BULL DURHAM"

Ron Shelton 
In baseball, you don't know nothing. 
--Yogi Berra 
Whoever wants to know the heart and mind of America had better learn baseball. 
--Jacques Barzun 
You could look it up. 
--Casey Stengel 
Titles over -- 
FADE IN: 
A series of still photos. Black and white. Ancient. 
BABE RUTH SWINGS -- An icon of American history. His giant upper body balanced delicately on tiny ankles and feet. The huge bat in an elegant follow-through... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
TY COBB ROUNDS THIRD -- The most vicious ballplayer of them all, a balletic whirling dervish. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
JACKIE ROBINSON STEALS ROME -- Yogi Berra applies the tag. Too late. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
JOE DIMAGGIO WITH HIS SON in the Yankee clubhouse. Walking down the runway, Joe in uniform. Number five. 
PULLBACK REVEALS: 
A WALL COVERED WITH BASEBALL PICTURES behind a small table covered with objects and lit candles. A baseball, an old baseball card, a broken bat, a rosin bag, a jar of pine tar -- also a peacock feather, a silk shawl, a picture of Isadora Duncan. Clearly, the arrangement is -- A SHRINE -- And it glows with the candles like some religious altar. 
We hear a woman's voice in a North Carolina accent. 
ANNIE (V.O.) I believe in the Church of Baseball. (beat) I've tried all the major religions and most of the minor ones -- I've worshipped Buddha, Allah, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, trees, mushrooms, and Isadora Duncan... 
PAN AWAY FROM THE SHRINE across the room. Late afternoon light spills into the room, across fine old furniture, to a small dressing table. A WOMAN applies make up. 
ANNIE SAVOY, mid 30's, touches up her face. Very pretty, knowing, outwardly confident. Words flow from her Southern lips with ease, but her view of the world crosses Southern, National and International borders. She's cosmic. 
ANNIE (V.O.) I know things. For instance -- (beat) There are 108 beads in a Catholic rosary. And -- (beat) There are 108 stitches in a baseball. (beat) When I learned that, I gave Jesus a chance. (beat) But it just didn't work out between us. The Lord laid too much guilt on me. I prefer metaphysics to theology. (beat) You see, there's no guilt in baseball... and it's never boring. 
ANNIE OPENS A CLOSET DOOR -- Dozens of shoes hang from the door. She chooses a pair of RED HIGH HEELS, with thin straps. She sits on a bench and 
ANNIE Which makes it like sex. (beat) There's never been a ballplayer slept with me who didn't have the best year of his career. (beat) Making love is like hitting a baseball -- you just got to relax and concentrate. 
ANNIE SLIPS ON THE RED HIGH HEELS -- Smoothing her hands up her calves as she does. 
ANNIE Besides, I'd never sleep with a player hitting under .250 unless he had a lot of R.B.I.'s or was a great glove man up the middle. (beat) A woman's got to have standards. 
SHE HOLDS OUR HER LEGS DISPLAYING THE HEELS, side by side. Like a little girl showing off her new shoes. 
ANNIE The young players start off full of enthusiasm and energy but they don't realize that come July and August when the weather is hot it's hard to perform at your peak level. (beat) The veterans pace themselves better. They finish stronger. They're great in September. (beat) While I don't believe a woman needs a man to be fulfilled, I do confess an interest in finding the ultimate guy -- he'd have that youthful exuberance but the veteran's sense of timing... 
ANNIE STARTS PACKING A HUGE HANDBAG -- With fruit, an official scorebook, binoculars, a radar gun, and lipstick. 
ANNIE Y'see there's a certain amount of "life-wisdom" I give these boys. (beat) I can expand their minds. Sometimes when I've got a ballplayer alone I'll just read Emily Dickinson or Walt Whitman to him. The guys are so sweet -- they always stay and listen. (beat) Of course a guy will listen to anything if he thinks it's foreplay. 
ANNIE TOUCHES PERFUME BEHIND HER EARS and, ever so slightly, in her cleavage. 
ANNIE I make then feel confident. They make me feel safe. And pretty. 
ANNIE POSES IN FRONT OF THE MIRROR -- She smoothes her dress along her hips. And puts on a flashy pair of sunglasses. Stylish and slightly mad. 
ANNIE What I give them lasts a life-time. What they give me lasts 142 games. Sometimes it seems like a bad trade. (quickly rebounding) But bad trades are part of baseball -- who can forget Frank Robinson or Milt Pappas, for Godsakes! (beat) It's a long season and you got to trust it. 
ANNIE STARTS FOR THE DOOR and grabs her baseball glove 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- DUSK 
A frame house with porch and lots of trees -- a Thomas Wolfe house... with a 1959 faded red Volvo in the driveway. 
ANNIE LEAVES ON FOOT, turning onto the sidewalk of a bucolic, old Durham, North Carolina neighborhood. In the b.g. other people are heading the same direction ANNIE PULLS A DURHAM BULLS BASEBALL CAP from her handbag and pulls it on her head. 
ANNIE I've tried them all -- I really have -- (beat) and the only church that truly feeds the soul -- day in, day out -- is the Church of Baseball. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE CHURCH -- DURHAM BASEBALL PARK -- DUSK 
Now visible In the late afternoon sun, a rickety old stadium carved into the center of an old Tobacco town. 
People are arriving on foot from all around... 
"Rock Around the Clock" by Bill Haley fills the air. 
ANNIE LOOKS THROUGH HER BINOCULARS -- Studying the players warming up casually on the sidelines as Patkin winds up his act. 
P.O.V. A LATIN PLAYER PLAYING PEPPER. 
ANNIE Number twenty-two's thighs are just great. Who's he? 
JACKSON (reading the program) Jose Galindo. He hit .314 at Lynchburg last year. 
ANNIE Three-fourteen? Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson. 
BACK TO MAX PATKIN -- He finishes his routine. 
RECORDING OVER P.A. Gonna rock, gonna rock around the clock tonight. 
INT.  PRESS BOX -- NIGHT 
CUT TO: 
A WOMAN ANNOUNCER, MARYLOU, 30, speaks into the P.A. mike. 
ANNOUNCER Let's hear it for Max Patkin -- 
Applause as Patkin takes his bows, leaves the field, shakes hands with a the BULL MASCOT LEADING THE APPLAUSE. 
ANNOUNCER "The Greatest Show on Dirt" -- your own Durham Bulls! 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE DUGOUT 
CLOSE ON ANOTHER PLAYER -- MICKEY MCFEE, 23, black. Smoking a cigarette -- always smoking a cigarette. He snuffs out his cigarette and RUNS onto the field with the rest of the team, as -- 
EBBY ENTERS THE DUGOUT from the runway. Larry and Skip encourage their players running onto the field. Ebby is trying to get the zipper on his fly unstuck. He smiles broadly at Skip and Larry, and grabs his glove. 
EBBY I'm there, Skip, I'm ready. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE PRESS BOX 
THE RADIO ANNOUNCER, TEDDY CULLINANE, 50, leans into the radio mike of a very small local station. Next to him is the local SPORTSWRITER, WHITEY SHERRARD, 40. Between them they've seen a million minor league players come and go. 
WHITEY Is this guy LaLoosh worth a hundred grand? I hear he's a quart low? 
TEDDY THE RADIO MAN (covering the mike) He's left handed. Whattya expect? (on the air) The Bulls are off to a slow start having dropped their first three games, but hope to turn it around tonight with the professional debut of the heralded young left hander, Ebby Calvin LaLoosh. (beat) Stepping in for the Peninsula White Sox is leadoff hitter Willie Foster 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE BALLFIELD -- NIGHT 
ANGLE TO ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- Millie has joined Annie and Jackson. Clearly, the younger women look up to Annie for wisdom and insight. 
ANNIE -- Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse. It'll just get everybody in trouble. 
MILLIE I got lured. 
ANNIE You didn't get "lured". Women never get lured. They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it -- "I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions". 
MILLIE "I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions". 
ANNIE That's better. (to Jackson) Got the radar ready? 
JACKSON Ready. 
JACKSON AIMS A RADAR GUN at the plate. 
THE PENINSULA WHITE SOX LEADOFF HITTER steps in. 
TEDDY THE RADIO MAN (V.O.) The word on LaLoosh is that the good looking young lefty has a major league fastball but sometimes has problems with his control. 
EBBY CALVIN LALOOSH WINDS UP and fires. The pitch sails over the batter's head, over the catcher's head, over the backstop, and CRASHES INTO THE PRESS BOX. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  THE PRESS BOX 
THE ANNOUNCER AND SPORTSWRITER CRASH to the floor as the ball smashes into their booth. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE DUGOUT 
SKIP SPITS TOBACCO, mumbles flatly to Larry. 
SKIP Little high. 
LARRY (shouts to EBBY) C'mon big 'un, you're okay... 
ANNIE'S BOX SEAT -- She turns to Jackson. 
JACKSON Ninety-five miles an hour. 
ANNIE He looks great, just great! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE PITCHER'S MOUND 
SKIP Struck out eighteen... 
LARRY League record. (beat) And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice -- also league records -- (beat) Joe, the guy's got some serious shit. 
THE DOOR OPENS -- A PLAYER ENTERS, in street clothes, carrying his suitcases. CRASH DAVIS, 30, older than the other players. And different. More than just opinions, he actually has a point of view. A career minor leaguer, hanging on wherever he can get a job. Unlike Ebby -- Crash knows a lot about the world without baseball. Also unlike Ebby -- he loves baseball desperately. 
LARRY Who're you? 
Crash speaks slowly, with a trace of cynicism and pride, like an old warrior who knows he's just a hired gun. 
CRASH I am the player to be named later. 
Beat. Skip looks out, half dressed, from his cubicle. 
SKIP Crash Davis? 
CRASH The Crash Davis. (beat, then nonstop) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3 -- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear. 
LARRY (remembering) Oh yeah. I shoulda throwed a slider. Damn, Crash, how're ya? 
SKIP I'm Joe Riggins. Sit down 
CRASH I'm too old for this shit. Why the hell am I back in "A" ball? 
SKIP 'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh. (beat) The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him -- 
LARRY He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head. 
SKIP -- we had the gun on him tonight -- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97. (beat) He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years. 
LARRY But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean... 
SKIP You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes -- (beat) We want you to mature the kid. 
CRASH "Mature" ain't a fuckin' verb. 
LARRY You go to college or what? 
SKIP We want you to room with him on the road and stay on his case all year. (beat) He can go all the way. 
CRASH And where can I go? 
SKIP You can keep going to the ballpark and keep gettin' paid to do it. (beat) Beats hell outta working at Sears. 
LARRY Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once. Sold Lady Kenmores -- it's nasty, nasty work. 
SKIP Even if it's the Carolina League -- this is a chance to play everyday. 
CRASH (angrily) You don't want a player, you want a stable pony. My Triple A contract gets bought out so I can hold the Flavor o' the Month's dick in the bus leagues?! (angrily) Fuck this fucking game... I fuckin' quit. 
CRASH RISES TO LEAVE -- Picks up his luggage, and turns to Skip and Larry before exiting. A deep breath 
CRASH Who we play tomorrow? 
Beat. They know, they share the inability to quit the game. They're all clinging to the Church of Baseball. 
SKIP Winston-Salem. Batting practice at 
CRASH LEAVES and as he does -- Ed (the catcher) enters. 
ED You wanted to see me? 
SKIP Yeah, Ed, shut the door... 
He does. Remains standing. He can see it coming. 
SKIP This is the toughest job a manager has, Ed... (deep breath) But the organization has decided to make a change -- we're releasing you from your contract... 
CLOSE ON ED -- Silent. Motionless. Empty. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE LOCKER ROOM -- 
CRASH PUTS HIS BAG IN A LOCKER as other players return from the shower. Crash watches as EBBY SOAKS HIS ELBOW IN A TUB OF ICE WATER as the sports writer, Whitey, interviews him. 
WHITEY How's it feel to get your first professional win? 
EBBY It feels "out there". A major rush. I mean it doesn't just feel "out there" but it feels out there. 
CRASH Hopeless. Utterly fucking hopeless. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MAXWELL'S BAR -- LATER THAT NIGHT 
Loud country music in the players' hangout and pickup spot. It's full of players and lots of young women. 
MILLIE SITS DOWN NEXT TO YET ANOTHER PLAYER, TONY, 25 -- He's slick, urban, smooth. 
MILLIE Hi, I'm Millie. 
TONY I'm Tony. I play left field. 
MILLIE I know. 
ANNIE SITS IN THE CORNER at her own table. Max Patkin, looking spiffy in a turtle neck sweater and double breasted blazer, sits down next to her. Old friends. 
CRASH From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot 
EBBY Don't try me. 
CRASH Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest. 
EBBY No way. 
CRASH C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh. (teasing mercilessly) C'mon, Rook -- show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head -- 
EBBY REARS BACK AND FIRES THE BALL -- From ten feet away, right at Crash's chest. But, alas -- 
THE BALL GOES THROUGH A SECOND STORY WINDOW in the distance. Crash never blinks. 
CRASH Ball four. 
EBBY IS ENRAGED -- HE CHARGES CRASH, lunging at him. 
EBBY Who the fuck are you?! 
CRASH LASHES OUT A SHORT LEFT -- With lightning speed, effortless. And brutal. BANG! Ebby goes down. And stays there stunned. He looks up. 
CRASH I'm Crash Davis. Your new catcher. And you just got Lesson Number One -- "Don't think -- it can only hurt the ballclub". (beat) Buy ya a drink? 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE CLUB -- NIGHT 
ANNIE AND MAX DANCE to Billy Eckstein on the juke box. Millie and Tony are also on the dance floor. 
ECKSTEIN (on juke box) April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom, Holiday tables under the tree... 
EBBY AND CRASH WATCH FROM THE CORNER TABLE -- Ebby's right eye is blackened. He holds a drink on it. 
EBBY We fight, she gets the clown -- how's that happen? 
CRASH Shut up -- I like this song... (sings along) April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve... 
EBBY She's playing with my mind. 
CRASH It's a damn easy thing to play with. 
ANNIE SUDDENLY APPEARS at the table. 
ANNIE Well -- you boys stopped fighting yet? Are you pals now? Good. I love a little macho male bonding -- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re- channeled" but I believe in "re- channeling" so who cares, right? (beat) Shall we go to my place? 
EBBY Which one of us? 
ANNIE Oh both of you, of course... 
CLOSE ON EBBY -- His eyes full of fear and wonder. 
CLOSE ON CRASH -- He smiles. 
THE THREE OF THEM LEAVE the bar together. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANNIE'S LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
THE SHRINE OF BASEBALL GLOWS -- Annie lights the candles. 
EBBY AND CRASH SIT ON OPPOSITE ENDS OF HER COUCH -- Both men look around the room with wonder. Ebby is clearly more nervous than Crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor league career. 
ANNIE These are the ground rules. (beat) I hook up with one guy a season -- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy -- kinda my own spring training... (beat) And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far. (beat) So... I thought we should get to know each other. 
CRASH Why do you get to choose? Why don't I get to choose? 
ANNIE Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction. There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart. 
EBBY Is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what? 
ANNIE You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey -- slow down. 
Crash rises to leave, and heads for the door. 
CRASH After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout. Besides -- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart... or loins. 
ANNIE (challenging him) What do you believe in? 
Crash at the door. Annie's question is slightly taunting. He stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion: 
CRASH I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap. (beat) I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days. 
ANNIE (breathless) Oh my... (softly) Don't leave... 
CRASH G'night. 
Crash heads out into the night. Annie hurries to the-door while Ebby sits on the couch, bewildered. 
EBBY Hey -- what's all this molecule stuff? 
ANNIE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY -- Crash is on the porch. 
ANNIE Wait, Crash -- don't go -- all I want is a date. I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'. 
CRASH I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy. 
CLOSE ON CRASH'S EYES -- Studying the "pitches" with intense concentration, endlessly working on his game. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE DURHAM FIELD -- NEXT DAY 
LARRY, DEKE, MICKEY AND BOBBY ARE SINGING at home plate as a pre-game show. Larry is Diana Ross, the other three are the Supremes, and the routine is brilliantly tacky. 
LARRY (AND THE SUPREMES) Baby love, oh oh, baby love, I need ya oh how I need ya, All ya do is treat me bad, Take my heart and leave me sad... 
CUT TO: 
INT. DURHAM BULLS LOCKER ROOM -- DAY 
JIMMY STANDS ON A BENCH trying to get the players' attention. 
JIMMY Listen up, guys, could I have your attention a minute? (a few heads turn) I'm going to be leading a daily chapel service at three in the afternoons here in the locker room and you're all invited to drop by and worship before batting practice. 
BOBBY Jimmy, God damn it -- loosen up and get laid. 
BOBBY, 25, smooths the creases of his uniform, preening. 
JIMMY I don't care If you think I'm square but I believe what I believe. 
All heads turn as: 
EBBY ENTERS THE LOCKER ROOM -- He looks trashed. 
BOBBY Jesus, Ebby, what truck ran over you? 
EBBY (glassy eyed) Call me "Nuke". Annie said it's my new nickname. 
Lots of teasing from around the clubhouse. 
DEKE Annie nailed you? That's great, means you're gonna have a helluva year. Does she fuck as good as they say? 
EBBY We didn't do it, man -- she read poetry to me all night, I swear. It's more tiring than fucking. 
EBBY GOES TO HIS LOCKER and starts undressing. Crash sits next to him, looking straight ahead. Bobby nearby. 
EBBY -- of love"... hey, Crash, does that mean what I think it means? What's the deal here? 
Crash studies Ebby. 
CRASH Your shower shoes have fungus on 'em. You'll never get to the Bigs with fungus on your shower shoes. (beat) Think classy and you'll be classy. If you win 20 in the Show you can let the fungus grow back on your shower shoes and the press'll think you're colorful. (beat) Until you win twenty in the Show, however, it means you're a slob. 
CRASH RISES AND HEADS OUT to the field. Ebby sits silently, holding his shower shoes, taking it all in. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. DURHAM BALLPARK -- GAME IN PROGRESS -- DAY 
IN THE DUGOUT -- THE GAME FROM A DUGOUT P.O.V. The players sit, stand, stir restlessly. A combination of relaxation and intensity not visible from the stands. 
CRASH IS HANDED HIS BAT and helmet by the bat boy. 
DEKE This guy's bringing some serious smoke out there. 
DUGOUT P.O.V. THE WINSTON-SALEM PITCHER throwing hard. 
CRASH He ain't got shit. 
FOLLOW CRASH INTO THE ON-DECK CIRCLE -- The ritual. The bat boy hands him the pine tar rag and he rubs pine tar on the bat with great care. 
CRASH RISES -- Heads to the plate. Talking to himself. 
CRASH You ain't getting that cheese by me, meat. 
CRASH TAKES HIS STANCE -- Upright. Calm. Head still. 
CRASH (V.O.) Look for the fastball up. He's gotta come with the cheese. Relax. Relax. Quick bat. Pop the clubhead. Open the hips. Relax. You're thinking too much. Get outta your fuckin' head, Crash. 
CLOSE ON CRASH'S FACE -- His eyes intensely focused. 
CRASH'S P.O.V. THE PITCHER -- Starts his windup. 
CRASH (V.O.) Get on top of the ball. Quick bat. Don't let him in your kitchen -- 
THE PITCHER DELIVERS -- Crash strides. Curveball. 
Crash swings and misses, offstride. Strike one. 
CRASH QUICKLY STEPS OUT OF THE BOX and picks up dirt. Rubs it on his hands. He's pissed. 
CRASH (V.O.) You stupid fuck, Crash. What're you swinging at a breaking ball for? Why's he starting me off with a hammer? Fuck me. (more dirt) You're okay. Stay back. Stay back, you dumb fuck. Wait. Wait. 
P.O.V. THE PITCHER'S NEXT DELIVERY -- CURVE BALL AWAY. 
CRASH STRIDES INTO THE PITCH -- Lashes a line drive down the first base line. Just foul. 
Crash has started to first. Pulls up. Returns slowly to the plate. Picks up his bat. 
CRASH Throw that shit again, meat. Throw that weak ass shit. (beat) Now he's gotta try to slip the cheese by me. One and one. You're on top. Now bring me the gas -- 
P.O.V.  PITCHER'S THIRD DELIVERY -- High and tight. Right at Crash's head. The ball seems to accelerate. About to explode his skull. For a moment -- THE FEAR OF DEATH... 
CRASH HITS THE DIRT -- It just misses his head. 
ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another pitch. 
ANNIE Damn. 
CRASH You're pulling your hips out. 
ANNIE But they're nice hips. (beat) I looked up your records -- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great! 
ANNIE FOULS ONE OFF and digs in gamely. 
CRASH Don't tell anybody. 
ANNIE Why not? If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ! The record's... 
CRASH 247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it. 
ANNIE Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it. 
CRASH No. Please. 
ANNIE SWINGS AND MISSES another one. 
ANNIE Damn. 
CRASH Let me. 
CRASH STEPS IN TO HIT -- He takes his familiar stance. The pitch comes. Crash drills it. 
CRASH Your place or mine? 
ANNIE Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao- Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous. 
CRASH Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause it might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around -- (whack -- a line drive) Great deal. You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing -- (whack -- a line drive) So what do you really want? You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic? (whack -- a line drive) Or do you want a guy? 
The pitching machine arm flaps. Empty. Silence. 
ANNIE Oh Crash... you do make speeches... 
Crash puts the bat down, heads out the gate. She follows. 
A LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM ARRIVES -- Twenty-five 10 year olds in uniform with a couple PARENT COACHES. 
LITTLE LEAGUER #1 Hey, are you Crash Davis! Can I have a autograph?! 
CRASH STOPS TO SIGN AUTOGRAPHS amidst 25 Little Leaguers. 
CRASH (as he signs autographs) Well, Annie, your place or mine? 
ANNIE You got me all confused. 
CRASH A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing -- 
ANNIE I'm not a real batter. I'm a woman. 
LITTLE LEAGUER Hey, when are you guys gonna start winning? You're terrible! 
ANNIE It's a long season, boys. 
SUDDENLY A VOICE -- Nuke pulls up, gets out of his Porsche. 
NUKE Hey! (coming over) What're you guys doing here -- stealing my girl? 
CRASH Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that? (to the little leaguers) Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh. 
LITTLE LEAGUERS It's Nuke, it's Nuke! Can I have your autograph?! Etc. 
NUKE No prob, kids -- 
And suddenly Nuke is swept up into a sea of Little Leaguers. Crash smiles as he turns Annie and the kids over to Nuke. 
CRASH See you guys at the ballpark. 
Crash leaves Annie with Nuke and 25 Little Leaguers. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CRASH GETS INTO HIS CAR -- CONTINUOUS 
AN AGING SHELBY MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- The paint's fading, a couple dings in the body, but loaded under the hood. 
CRASH PUNCHES HIS TAPE DECK -- Sam Cooke's "You Send Me". 
ANNIE BITES HER FIST watching Crash leave. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ANNIE'S BEDROOM -- DAY 
The sounds of lovemaking in a darkened room lit only by a few candles. 
ANNIE Yes, yes, yesnmmmmyes... (beat) Oh my... (several beats) Oh, that was just fabulous, Crash. 
Several beats of silence. 
NUKE Crash? 
He flips on a lamp near the bed. 
ALL HEADS TURN, A HELICOPTER APPEARS ABOVE THE FIELD 
CUT TO: 
BACK TO THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL -- Hair and hats blowing from the chopper turbulence. 
MAYOR ...five, four, three, two, one... let 'er go! One thousand big ones! 
THE HELICOPTER DUMPS HUNDREDS OF DOLLAR BILLS above the field. 
The night sky fills with fluttering money THE ROPE IS DROPPED -- THREE HUNDRED LITTLE LEAGUERS charge across the infield to the falling money, scooping it up wildly, brawling, shoving, clawing for the cash. 
As the money flutters down... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DURHAM BASEBALL STADIUM -- SHORT TIME LATER 
CLOSE ON THE ROSIN BAG on the mound. A hand picks it up. 
Puffs of rosin "smoke". Nuke is on the mound. 
NUKE NERVOUSLY WALKS AROUND THE MOUND -- Just before the first batter. He picks up the rosin bag. Digs a slot for his lead foot to land. And CRASH APPROACHES, in full gear, mask tipped up on his head. 
CRASH Don't try to strike everybody out. (beat) Strikeouts are boring. They're Fascist. Throw some ground balls, it's more Democratic. 
CRASH TURNS AND HEADS TO THE PLATE and we hear the beginning of Nuke's interior monologue. 
NUKE (V.O.) What's this guy know, eh? If he's so great why's he been in the minors for ten years? And if he's so hot how come Annie wants me instead of him. 
CRASH TURNS AROUND HALF WAY TO THE PLATE and returns to the mound, as if he knows everything Nuke's thinking. 
CRASH And listen, meat. You don't know shit. If you want to get to the Show, you'll listen to me. She only wants you 'cause she can boss you around, got it? (beat, complete tone change) Relax, have a ball out here. This game's fun, okay? Fun, God damn it. (beat) And don't squeeze the ball so tight. It's an egg. Hold it like an egg. 
CRASH SMILES -- And trots back to the plate. 
NUKE'S P.O.V. The first batter steps in. Crash gives the sign for the pitch. 
NUKE Fun? What's he know about fun? (beat) Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat. 
CRASH Shake off the pitch. Throw what you wanta. 
NUKE SHAKES OFF THE PITCH -- Here comes Crash back out to the mound before Nuke's thrown a pitch. 
CRASH Why you shaking me off? 
NUKE I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority. 
CRASH "To announce your fucking presence with authority"? This guy's a first ball fastball hitter. He's looking for heat. 
NUKE But he ain't seen my heat -- 
CRASH Awright, meat, give him your heat. 
CRASH RETURNS ONE MORE TIME to behind the plate. 
CRASH CROSSES THE PLATE, past the hitter. He speaks to the opposing leadoff batter. 
CRASH Fastball. 
NUKE Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche. 
NUKE WINDS UP AND DELIVERS -- A fastball. 
THE LEADOFF HITTER TEES OFF on the pitch and sends a line shot over the right field fence. 
CLOSE ON BILLBOARD -- "Hit Cow, Win Steak" sign, The home run hits the cow on a target painted on the cow's rump. 
The COW'S MOUTH OPENS AND MOOS. 
THE BATTER STANDS AND WATCHES the home run, admiring the shot, enjoying the moment. CRASH GETS IN HIS FACE instantly -- and gets very tough. 
CRASH What're you lookin' at?! You're showing up my pitcher, bush -- get your ass in gear! 
THE BATTER TAKES OFF ON A HOME RUN TROT -- Slightly scared. 
AND CRASH HEADS TO THE MOUND where Nuke watches the Mooing Cow and the circling batter with dismay. Crash smiles. 
CRASH Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh? 
NUKE Well, I held it like an egg. 
CRASH An' he scrambled the son of a bitch. (beat) Having fun yet? 
NUKE I'm having a blast. (beat) God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball. 
CRASH He did know. 
NUKE How? 
CRASH I told him. 
CRASH SMILES -- Drops the mask, returns behind the plate. 
NUKE SIGHS -- Takes a deep breath. 
NUKE Don't think. Just throw. Don't think. Just throw. 
A couple snickers from the players. Skip whirls. 
SKIP What're you laughing at?! 
Silence. 
The Durham Bulls sit and stand quietly. 
SKIP You guys lollygag the ball around the infield, ya lollygag you're way to first, ya lollygag in an' outta the dugout. You know what that makes ya (beat) Lollygaggers. What's our record, Larry? 
LARRY We're eight and sixteen. 
SKIP Eight and sixteen?! How'd we ever win eight? (beat) Jose, what's this sign? 
SKIP FLASHES THROUGH A SEQUENCE of signs. Hand to face, hand to belt, hand brushes letters, etc. 
JOSE That's the steal. 
SKIP Wrong. That's the bunt. This is the steal. 
SKIP FLASHES QUICKLY ANOTHER SEQUENCE -- Hand to face, hands to hands. He speaks rapidly -- a private language. 
SKIP Face is "skin to skin". Skin starts with "S". "S" stands for steal if it follows the indicator which is hand to eye 'cause the word "indicator" starts with an "I" so I figure "eye" -- (touches his eye) -- would remind you of "I" for indicator to indicate that what follows is the sign. I figure wrong -- You're a buncha lollygaggers. (beat) This is a simple game. (beat) ya throw the ball, ya hit the ball, ya catch the ball. 
CLOSE ON FACES OF THE PLAYERS -- Sitting silently. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE BALLPARK SIMULTANEOUS -- NIGHT 
THE SIX PLAYERS' WIVES WAIT in a cluster. Three of them have SMALL CHILDREN. The children are crying. 
The long-suffering women try to calm the kids. 
BOBBY'S WIFE Bobby went hitless again. He's gonna be in a terrible mood... terrible. How'd Mickey do? 
MICKEY'S WIFE He got two hits. 
BOBBY'S WIFE Lucky you.

THE DOOR OPENS -- BOBBY ENTERS wearing only a towel. 
BOBBY You wanted to see me? 
SKIP Yeah, Bobby, shut the door. (he does) This is the toughest job a manager has... (beat) But the organization has decided to make a change -- 
BOBBY Skip, I know I'm in a slump but I hit the ball hard tonight, right at 'em. A couple flares drop in, and I'm back in the groove! 
The nearly naked 25 year old man pleads helplessly -- his career is over. 
CUT TO:

BOBBY'S WIFE Oh God... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAWN 
THE DURHAM BULLS TEAM BUS is parked. Luggage is loaded. Sleepy players arriving, escorted by wives and girlfriends. 
ANNIE BIDS NUKE GOODBYE -- Off to the side. She pulls something from her handbag and hands it to Nuke. A pair of WOMEN'S RED PANTIES, with lace and frills. 
ANNIE I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch. 
NUKE What? 
ANNIE They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently -- plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters. 
NUKE Jesus, Annie, I don't know -- 
ANNIE You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain. These'll help move things to the right side. 
NUKE Big League pitchers don't use these. 
ANNIE They did when they were in the Carolina League. 
NUKE STUFFS THE PANTIES in his pocket, bewildered. A small kiss from Annie, and he hurries to the bus. 
CRASH I was in the Show for 21 days, once. (beat) It was the greatest 21 days of my life. You never touch your luggage in the show -- somebody else handles your bags. It's great. (beat) The ballparks are like cathedrals, the hotels all have room service, the women have long legs and brains -- it's a smorgasbord. 
DEKE The women are hot, eh? 
CRASH Yeah -- and so are the pitchers. They throw ungodly breaking stuff in the Show -- exploding sliders. 
Nuke, Tony, and Deke murmur in awe at Crash's pronouncement. 
CRASH You could be one of those guys -- but you don't give a fuck, Meat. 
NUKE God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"! You wanta step outside! 
CRASH HOPS TO HIS FEET as the bus barrels along, grabbing Nuke by the collar. 
CRASH Yeah, let's go. 
Nuke quickly has second thoughts -- Crash can be terrifying. 
NUKE No. Wait a minute. Calm down, Crash... 
Nuke sits back down. Calms. Reaches for a baseball sitting nearby. He hands the ball to Crash. 
NUKE Teach me how to throw a breaking ball. 
Crash takes the ball gently and speaks softly: 
CRASH As I was saying ya hold it like an egg. 
As the bus rolls through the country: 
A LATE 60'S OLDS CONVERTIBLE ROARS PAST -- Max Patkin at the wheel. He waves at the team bus and honks. 
The opening bars on the National Anthem -- "Oh Say Can You See" 
And Max roars off through the rolling green-landscape... 
Hit Hank Williams music to play over:

INT. DURHAM RADIO STATION -- DAY 
TEDDY THE ANNOUNCER re-creates the game for broadcast with a several second delay. 
HIS ASSISTANT (P.A. ANNOUNCER FROM THE BALLPARK) has a phone to her ear, and writes down each play on a piece of paper, holding it up for Teddy who enhances shamelessly in his ON THE AIR "play by play". 
CLOSE ON PAPER -- His assistant writes "DOUBLE TO LEFT". 
TEDDY HITS A TINY MALLET against a jar. Thunk. The sound of ball hitting bat. He punches one of several tape cassettes cued up. A crowd roars. An array of special effects is at his fingertips. 
TEDDY (on the air) ...double off the wall by Higgins, and once again the Durham pitchers are unable to get the first out of the inning... 
HIS ASSISTANT WRITES ANOTHER NOTE -- "ERROR MCFEE" 
Thunk -- The mallet again.

DEKE ICES THE CHAMPAGNE -- In the b.g. Tommy is blow drying his hair. Mickey puts the finishing touches on his outfit. Several other players get ready to party. 
DEKE Par--ty! I blew a whole day's meal money for this champagne seven dollars, man, it better be good. 
MICKEY For seven bucks it better be some serious shit.

CRASH Naw... 
NUKE "Naw"? There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater? 
CRASH By the dozen. Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies -- (beat) I'm through with one night stands. 
NUKE You're through with one night stands?! What do you want? 
CRASH I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries -- and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am. 
Nuke just stares at him. 
NUKE You're weird, man -- I want a ice skater real bad. 
CRASH Go for it. 
NUKE If I get laid, you won't tell Annie? 
CRASH I won't have to. 
NUKE LOOKS AT HIM STRANGELY -- And hurries to the party.

THE DOOR OPENS -- It's Nuke. 
NUKE Hey, guys, pa--rty! 
TOMMY Shut up and be cool, man. Like Mickey there... 
MICKEY "LOUNGES" WITH A DRINK and a cigaret. 
MICKEY You wanta make it to the Show, Rock, you gotta learn how to "lounge".

NUKE How's this? 
MICKEY You got it. 
A knock at the door. 
TOMMY Entre. 
EIGHT ICE SKATERS STAND IN THE DOORWAY -- Ready to... 
SKIP Eight and twenty-four! How'd we ever win 8 games? 
LARRY It's a miracle. 
SKIP Look, guys -- I'm a man, I got needs too.  I understand this party -- but... (beat) sex is the one thing you can get further behind in and catch up faster than anything I know. (beat) There's a baseball lesson in there somewhere. (looking around) Where's Crash? 
NUKE STEPS FORWARD -- Hands Skip the hundred dollar bill.. 
NUKE He can't make it. Here's his fine. 
SKIP Aw Christ, he don't have to come. He's hitting .350. 
TOMMY Don't you think that's a double standard -- we're here and he ain't? 
SKIP I believe in a double standard for guys hitting .350. (beat) Look, men -- you got a choice. You wanta be roasting your nuts off for Midas Muffler welding exhaust pipes up the assholes of Cadillacs... or -- (beat) You wanta be sitting in the Caddy while some other guy's crawling around in a monkey suit with a blow torch? (beat) There's only two places you can be in life -- in the Caddy or under it. (nearly pleading) These are the best years of your lives. These are the glamor days.

CRASH Helluva guy -- 
Silence. 
Crash flips off the T.V. with the remote. 
NUKE Can I ask you something? 
CRASH What? 
NUKE What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties? 
CRASH If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him. 
Crash turns off the light.

FANS IN THE BALLPARK LAUGH at Nuke, mocking his. 
EXTREME CLOSE UP ON NUKE'S EYES -- Frightened. 
SLOW FULLBACK ON NUKE -- HE'S STARK NAKED save for his cap and glove. Everyone else is clothed.

INT. TEAM BUS -- DAWN 
CLOSE ON NUKE'S FACE -- He awakes with a start. 
NUKE No! 
CRASH LEANS OVER and shakes him. 
CRASH Wake up, it's okay... you're dreaming... 
CRASH HELPS NUKE back to consciousness. Nuke shakes his head, trying to wake up. Crash is almost tender. 
NUKE I was playing naked. 
CRASH I know, I know -- I have that dream all the time. We're almost home. 
The Bus continues across the Carolina landscape. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE STADIUM PARKING LOT -- DAWN 
The team bus pulls into a deserted parking lot. A few of the players' cars are parked. Some of the wives and girlfriends. And Annie. 
THE PLAYERS SHUFFLE OFF the bus. Tired and beat. 
CLOSE ON NUKE -- He looks worse than the rest. He sees Annie and waves. She's waiting next to her old Volvo. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM MOMENTS LATER 
ANNIE'S VOLVO PULLS OUT -- She drives. 
INT. THE VOLVO -- DAY 
Annie is up -- Nuke is down. 
Nuke stares, unsettled. 
NUKE God... I think I'm gonna be sick -- 
ANNIE Oh don't be silly. Death is nothing to be scared of. It's just another way of living. It's just a fresh start -- kinda like spring training. 
Nuke thinks about this carefully. Looks at the ashes, at Annie, and at Jackson, in full gear, mask on his head. 
NUKE Death is like spring training? 
ANNIE Yes. And so is birth. Now look me in the eyes, Nuke -- (sweetly accusing him) You haven't been wearing my panties, have you? 
CLOSE ON NUKE -- Utterly bewildered. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BULLS LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT 
NUKE PULLS HIS JOCKSTRAP ON over the red panties. 
Crash notices the panties, and snaps the waistband. 
CRASH Hot. Very hot... 
Nuke looks around nervously, continues dressing quickly. 
NUKE Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers. She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for. 
CRASH Annie's a smart lady. 
Suddenly Deke spots Nuke's panties. 
DEKE Hey, fruit alert! Check out the Rook. 
SEVERAL PLAYERS GATHER AROUND -- Wolf whistles aimed at Nuke as the players are dressing into their uniforms. 
NUKE Annie says there's no such thing as straight and gay. We're all sexual creatures to start with, and we get formed into certain roles. 
TOMMY You believe that? 
NUKE When I'm one and six I'll believe anything. (as they dress) Annie also says that God is a woman. You believe that, Crash, you think God's a lady? 
CRASH God's definitely a woman -- but she's no lady. 
TOMMY This is all Commie bullshit. (beat) God has a dick, man. 
TONY God damn it, Jimmy, you're an expert -- does God have a dick or a pussy? 
JIMMY TURNS FROM HIS CUBICLE to answer the theological question.  Ll heads wait for the answer. 
JIMMY The Lord God is tri-une -- Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 
TOMMY Father and Son. Awright! 
The guys slap fives, convinced God is a man. 
MICKEY (baiting them) Yeah, but He is a brother. 
TOMMY Bullshit! God ain't no brother! 
Deke turns to Crash, full of despair. 
DEKE If there is a God, why am I hitting 
SUDDENLY SKIP AND LARRY APPEAR to restore order. 
SKIP Shut up! This is a damn noisy clubhouse for a team that's lost 15 straight.

CUT TO: 
BACK TO THE FIELD -- Nuke's next pitch. 
THE NEXT BATTER POPS UP -- Crash circles into foul ground to make the catch, whipping the ball around the infield. 
AND CRASH GOES TO THE MOUND for a visit. 
NUKE Hey, I'm cruisin', man -- what're you doing out here?! 
CRASH I want you to throw this one at the bat rack. 
NUKE Why?! I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to. 
CRASH It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters. Trust me. 
NUKE You're the boss. 
CRASH RETURNS TO THE PLATE -- Flashes a sign.

CUT TO: 
NUKE'S NEXT DELIVERY -- A wild ass rocket thirty feet off line. The BULL MASCOT DIVES for cover. 
THE BATTER STEPS OUT OF THE BOX nervously, muttering. 
BATTER This guy's crazy. 
CRASH Yep. Next one might be at your head. Hell if I know where the damn thing's going... 
CLOSE ON NUKE -- Smiles. Winds. Delivers. A change up. 
THE BATTER SWINGS TERRIBLY OFF STRIDE -- Strike three. Crash whips the ball around the infield.

NUKE Bear down, Meat, don't let up. You own these guys. Dad'll love a shutout... 
P.O.V. CRASH FLASHES THE SIGN -- Nuke doesn't like it. 
NUKE No, no -- this guy's looking for heat -- lemme give him the deuce -- 
NUKE SHAKES OFF THE SIGN Cocky, full of himself.

ANNIE AND JACKSON in her box seat. 
ANNIE Oh no -- he's shaking off the sign, Jackson. Big mistake... 
JACKSON He'll learn. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON CRASH BEHIND THE PLATE 
CRASH This son of a bitch is throwing a two hit shutout and he's shaking me off?! (to batter and umpire) Hey Charlie, here comes the deuce. 
NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- A hanging curveball. The batter takes an ungodly cut, and BLASTS a long home. 
THE BATTER STANDS AT THE PLATE watching the blast... until CRASH SHOVES HIM toward first with a sneer. For a moment it looks like there'll be a fight -- but the hitter backs off and takes the home run trot as: 
NUKE STARES AT THE OUTFIELD WALL as the batter circles the bases. Crash walks to the mound. 
NUKE You told him I was throwing a deuce, right? 
CRASH Yep. He really crushed that dinger, didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet... damn... 
NUKE HOLDS OUT HIS GLOVE -- Says nothing. Crash puts a new ball in the glove. Returns to the plate. 
NUKE GETS THE SIGN -- Winds. Delivers. Batter hits a weak one hopper back to the mound. Game's over.

CRASH It's time you started working on your interviews. 
NUKE What do I gotta do? 
CRASH Learn your clichés. Study them. Know them. They're your friends. 
Crash hands Nuke a small pad and pen. 
CRASH Write this down. (beat) "We gotta play 'em one day at a time." 
NUKE Boring. 
CRASH Of course. That's the point. (beat) "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub." 
NUKE Jesus. 
CRASH Write, write -- "I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out." 
NUKE STARTS WRITING them down. 
NUKE "...Good Lord willing, things'll work out." 
CRASH Yep. So how's Annie? 
Nuke looks up from his clichés, startled. 
NUKE She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy -- maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down. What'ya think? 
CRASH You outta your mind? If you give in now you might start losing. (beat) Never fuck with a winning streak. 
Nuke nods seriously, listening to the master.

MILLIE Hi, Jimmy. Want a ride? 
JIMMY (nervously) Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior? 
MILLIE No.

NUKE SITS AT THE TABLE -- He's just finished eating. 
Annie circles him. A pot of soup on the stove. 
ANNIE I'm so proud of you and all the guys. Want some more soup? 
NUKE No, no, it was great. 
ANNIE How 'bout a back rub? 
NUKE No, that's okay. All I need's a little nap. 
ANNIE I'll tuck you in. 
NUKE (nervously) You can't seduce me. 
ANNIE I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie... 
ANNIE STRETCHES OUT HER LEG and lays it an the table. 
NUKE What's that? 
She pulls back her skirt slightly, exposing her garter snaps attached to her stockings. 
ANNIE That's my leg. 
NUKE I know what it is. 
ANNIE I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love. 
She strokes her leg. Nuke stares fearfully. 
CRASH I think of you and the "boy" all the time. 
ANNIE He won't make love to me anymore. 
CRASH And he's right! A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often. (beat) You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties -- then you are! (beat) And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit. 
ANNIE I want you desperately! 
Crash can hardly keep up. So he slows her down -- 
CRASH Who are you? Do you have a job? 
ANNIE I teach part time at the Junior College. What if I told you I was through with Nuke? He learned his lessons quickly and left me. 
CRASH And now you wanta teach me? 
ANNIE I don't imagine there's much I could teach you. 
CRASH I doubt that. 
ANNIE Crash, I get wet just thinking about you. 
CRASH I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy? 
ANNIE I'm ready for a complicated man. 
CRASH -- and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms. 
ANNIE I said when I think about you, I get wet. 
CRASH Annie, I think you should leave. 
Annie launches into a tirade without orchestration or self- awareness. She's frustrated, confused, angry and... 
ANNIE God damn you -- what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me? (beat) This is the weirdest season I ever saw -- the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid! 
CRASH (softly) You okay? 
Annie slides against the wall down to the floor. Tears flow. Her makeup runs. Her eyes are red. 
ANNIE (shakily) I need a drink. 
Crash gingerly helps her to her feet. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MAXWELL'S BAR -- DAY 
ANNIE AND CRASH SIT IN THE CORNER of the empty bar. 
CRASH Why baseball? 
ANNIE (sighs) I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5 -- born again before kindergarten... by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home... 
SHE SMILES at the most painful memories. 
ANNIE pregnant, had an abortion, got pregnant again, had an abortion again... gave up men. Tried women. Missed men. My mother died. (beat) I bought a car for $200 and drove to Ft. Lauderdale to bury her. (beat) And after we'd sung some hymns in some wretched Florida funeral home, I went outside and something happened -- 
Her tone becomes wistful, nostalgic. 
ANNIE The smell of cut grass in the warm March air overwhelmed me and I heard a noise -- (makes the sound)) -- tok, tok, tok -- and some men shouting... then tok, tok, tok. 
Crash smiles slightly. He knows. 
ANNIE I crossed the street -- it was the New York Yankees spring training field -- tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat -- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother... (beat) And I saw him. 
CRASH Who? 
ANNIE Thurman Munson. (beat) He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody -- it was beautiful... (beat) And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition! (beat) So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball. 
CRASH What's so great about baseball? 
ANNIE If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else -- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home. (beat) Don't you see? If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is! 
Silence. 
CRASH I don't know if I'd go that far. 
ANNIE It's true, It's true! (beat, down) Least it used to be true. It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash? 
CRASH It's possible. 
ANNIE No. 
CRASH Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 
ANNIE Well... I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to. Lately I'm not so sure. 
CRASH Why not? 
ANNIE (angrily) Whatta you mean "why not"? Are you gonna play forever?! 
Before Crash can answer -- 
SUDDENLY A VOICE interrupts. They both turn to see: 
MILLIE EXCITEDLY DRAGGING JIMMY into the nearly empty bar. 
BACK IN THE KITCHEN 
Nuke's father is studying pictures on Annie's wall. 
CLOSE ON A HELMUT NEWTON PHOTO -- A nude woman, two afghans, and a toilet. 
CLOSE ON A PHOTO OF SWAMI PRABHAVANANDA YOGANDA 
CLOSE ON A POSTER OF A MARIJUANA LEAF with the inscription "Better Living Through Mexican Agriculture". 
Nuke's father is a bit unsettled by all this, when: 
The phone rings. 
ANNIE SWEEPS BACK into the kitchen -- saved by the bell -- to answer the phone. Nuke trails. 
ANNIE (on phone) Hello? Skip? Yeah, as a matter of fact, he is here. 
She hands the phone to Nuke. 
ANNIE It's Skip, for you. 
NUKE (ON PHONE) Yeah, Skip, it's me. (several beats) Jeez... Jeez... God... Jeez... 
Nuke hangs up the phone. Looks at Annie and his father. 
NUKE I'm going to the Show. (beat) They're sending me up to finish out the season with the Big Club. I'm going to the Show! 
NUKE'S FATHER LEAPS TO HIS FEET and embraces his son. 
NUKE'S FATHER Let's have a quick word of prayer, right here, to thank the Lord for all this -- 
ANNIE Oh let's not... 
NUKE I gotta leave first thing in the morning. 
ANNIE That's great! 
NUKE How can I possibly thank you? 
He embraces her rather formally. 
ANNIE Just pitch well and do good. 
Nuke hustles his father out of the house. 
NUKE I will, I will -- C'mon, Dad, I'll dump you off. I gotta find Crash. 
As they exit, Nuke's father turns to Annie: 
NUKE'S FATHER God bless you. 
ANNIE (to herself) She will, Mr. LaLoosh, she will... 
ANNIE SITS DOWN in a kitchen chair. An enormous sigh. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE DOWNTOWNER MOTEL -- NIGHT 
Nuke knocks on Crash's door. Nobody home. Tony is arriving with his GROUPIE GIRLFRIEND to the next room. 
TONY Crash ain't there. He never gets back till four or five -- 
NUKE Where does he go? 
TONY Well, I'd rather not say. 
NUKE They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye. 
TONY COMES OVER AND GIVES NUKE a heartfelt "five". 
TONY Goddamn, that's great! Jesus! (beat) Listen, Crash don't like anybody to know it but -- (beat) Most nights he goes down to, you know, down to Niggertown. To Sandy's... the whorehouse. 
NUKE He goes to a whorehouse every night? 
TONY Don't tell him I told you -- he'd break my neck. 
CLOSE ON NUKE -- Disturbed. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE BLACK SECTION OF DURHAM -- NIGHT 
A CAB MOVES SLOWLY through a poor neighborhood. Stops at: 
AN OLD HOUSE -- Decades of ad hoc add-ons. 
BLACK CABBIE That's Sandy's. Keep your extra cash In your shoes. 
NUKE GETS OUT and goes to the door. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SANDY'S WHOREHOUSE -- NIGHT 
NUKE KNOCKS AT THE DOOR -- A small barred window opens. 
The air of victory. The mood is up and goofy. Beer cans are squirted at Jimmy, the groom. 
JIMMY I wanta thank everybody and the Lord for the victory, it's a wonderful way to celebrate my marriage -- and I guess we're all back on a winning streak, he? A few raucous "Fuckin A's" from the team. 
TONY Hey, Jimmy -- we chipped in and kind got a little gift for ya of a special wedding cake from the Durham Bulls. 
DEKE CARRIES OUT AN WEDDING CAKE -- It's X-Rated. The decorative Bride and Groom are fucking. Jimmy's embarrassed but it's all good natured. 
CUT TO: 
CRASH COMING OUT OF THE SHOWER -- Toweling off, watching the innocent, vulgar fun. He sits down in front of his locker, drying his hair, when the CLUBHOUSE BOY approaches: 
CLUBHOUSE BOY Hey, Crash -- Skip wants to see ya. 
CRASH RISES AND HEADS FOR SKIP'S CUBICLE -- Wearing only a towel and his shower shoes. 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE SKIP'S OFFICE -- Skip and Larry sit in postgame routine, checking charts, smoking, half dressed. 
CRASH ENTERS as he's still drying off. 
CRASH Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me? 
SKIP Crash, shut the door. 
And it hits him. Crash looks at Skip, who looks down at the floor, unwilling to face Crash who then looks at Larry, who also looks away nervously. 
CRASH SHUTS THE DOOR -- The party rages beyond. 
SKIP (heartfelt) This is the toughest job a manager has... 
CLOSE ON CRASH -- He's been in the game too long to be surprised; nonetheless, he's surprised. And hurt. His stoicism is professional. 
SKIP The organization wants to make a change... now that Nuke's gone they wanta bring up some young catcher... 
LARRY Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg... probably a bust. 
SKIP I put in a word for you with the organization -- told 'em I thought you'd make a fine minor league manager someday... Might be an opening at Salem next year -- 
EXTREME CLOSE UP ON CRASH -- His eyes are moist. 
SKIP Helluva year, Crash -- you know how it is. 
Silence. 
Crash stands there nearly nude. He just nods slightly. Without rancor or bitterness, he turns and re-enters the raucous locker room. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM -- NIGHT 
CRASH WALKS THE STREETS ALONE -- Crash stops in front of a window and takes his batting stroke, studying the reflection. 
AND HE KEEPS WALKING INTO: 
CUT TO: 
EXT/INT. CHEAP BAR IN DOWNTOWN DURHAM -- NIGHT 
CRASH DRINKING ALONE at the end of a bar. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREETS OF DURHAM -- NIGHT 
CRASH WANDERS ALONG into the residential neighborhoods. 
HE STARTS ACROSS A QUIET INTERSECTION Stops. Looks at the street signs. He CHANGES DIRECTION, walks on. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
The windows glow. After midnight. 
CRASH STARES AT THE HOUSE -- Hesitates, then walks up the porch stairs. Knocks at the door. Moments later: 
ANNIE OPENS THE DOOR -- She looks beautiful. Almost as if she was expecting him. At first, silence. Then: 
CRASH I got released. 
ANNIE I heard already. 
SHE OPENS THE DOOR -- Crash enters Annie's house. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANNIE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT 
ANNIE PUTS ON her favorite Piaf record. 
ANNIE POURS A DRINK for both of them. 
CRASH PUTS A HAND ON HER HIP -- Annie closes her eyes, a tiny gasp. He kisses her forehead. She kisses his neck. A tiny smile from Crash. The same from Annie. 
SHE KISSES HIM on the corner of his mouth. Her hand finds the back of his head and she runs her fingers through his hair.

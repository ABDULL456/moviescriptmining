FIRST DRAFT 
October 20, 1986 
FADE IN: 
EXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT 
The place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed. 
The city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready to burst. 
EXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT 
Amid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned -- long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition. 
On the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the Gotham night. 
One of them is moving. 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT 
The pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness. Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high- fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know each other... with one conspicuous exception: 
A TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street. 
MOM For God's sake, Harold, can we please just get a taxi?? 
DAD I'm trying to get a -- (shouting) TAXI!! 
Three cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map. 
JIMMY We're going the wrong way. 
Nearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys them nervously, gestures toward the subway map. 
DAD Put that away. We'll look like tourists. 
TWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER. The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.  JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks him off down the street and glowers at DAD. 
DAD (cont.) We'll never get a cab here. Let's cut over to Seventh. 
JIMMY Seventh is that way. 
DAD I know where we are! 
EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
A deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them. 
VOICE Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar? 
The VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.' 
MOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then move on -- pretending not to hear. 
DERELICT Mister. How about it. One dollar? (standing up) One dollar, man. Are you deaf? Are you deaf? -- Do you speak English?? 
By now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street. Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following. 
They pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck. 
DAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's already searching for DAD's wallet. 
MOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his gun on JIMMY. 
STREET PUNK Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't scream. 
The poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street. 
The two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle, slap hands, race off in the opposite direction. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
Six stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take. 
NICK (emptying the wallet) All right. The Gold Card. (tossing the credit card in EDDIE's face) Don't leave home without it. 
A chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up. 
EDDIE Let's beat it, man. I don't like being up here. 
NICK What, scared of heights? 
VICKI Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal here. What's new and hot in Gotham City? 
KNOX It's too good, Vick. We got a six- foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers. 
VICKI (laughing) Evildoers, huh? Big or small? 
KNOX Small so far. I mean -- they don't allow bats in boardrooms, do they. 
VICKI Speaking of which... I hear the notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a big do for the Harvey Dent campaign. 
KNOX Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every law'n'order freak in the city's gonna be there. 
KNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI may have a purpose in all this. 
KNOX (cont.) Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying -- 
She reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement. 
KNOX (cont.) Aw, Vicki. Vicki! (apprehensively) Got a date? 
She flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no. KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair. 
KNOX (cont.) Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always loved you. Will you marry me? 
VICKI (straightening her clothes) No. 
KNOX Well, I'm starving. Will you at least buy me a hamburger? 
VICKI Yes, but please -- be gentle. 
Overwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PENTHOUSE - DAY 
A HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham. This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm. 
GRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS -- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this makeshift 'boardroom.'  The big boss waves a copy of the Gotham Globe -- with HARVEY DENT's face on the cover. 
GRISSOM Nine points ahead in the new poll. I don't like the way this is shaping up. 
JACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle. 
JACK We can always pop him. -- Or pop someone close to him. 
LIEUTENANT Let's feed him to the bat. 
This suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the crowd. GRISSOM is unamused. 
GRISSOM He's going after our front companies. Specifically Ace Chemical. Which would tie us in with Councilman Kane, Senator Miller... on up the line. (pause) We have to clean out our files before the subpoena comes down. 
LIEUTENANT How do we go? The usual fire? 
GRISSOM I'm thinking break-in. Trash the office, remove the relevant documents... 
JACK "Industrial espionage." 
GRISSOM That's right. And Jack -- (pause) I'd like you to handle this operation personally. 
JACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the deck. His hand freezes in midair. 
JACK ... Me? 
At this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator. She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS. 
GRISSOM Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd mind waiting in the other room. 
ALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM. 
JACK Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in? 
GRISSOM (emphatically) Because I want someone I can trust. 
JACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace. 
It's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre HOLE through its face. 
GRISSOM (cont.) We'll work out the details later. But it's got to be soon. -- All right, that's all for now. 
GRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers behind a moment. 
GRISSOM (cont.) You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an important job. I can't trust it to somebody who'll screw up. 
JACK I understand. 
GRISSOM (smiling) Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck. 
JACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY. 
GRISSOM (cont.) My friend, your luck is just about to change. 
He reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver. 
GRISSOM (cont.) Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt. 
KNOX (cont.) This guy has just gotten interesting. What else do you know? 
VICKI Just what I've heard. Rich. Reclusive. Old money and lots of it. 
KNOX Likes to kill? 
VICKI (smiling) Women find him magnetic. 
KNOX I bet they like him for his big charity balls. 
VICKI That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks. 
KNOX Well, you know me. The more they've got, the less they're worth. (scanning the room) This guy must be the most worthless man in America. 
Just then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes. 
BRUCE WAYNE You disappoint me. Why not the world? 
KNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered... and intensely handsome. 
KNOX I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host. (extending a hand) Alexander Knox. 
BRUCE Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work. I quite like it. 
KNOX Great. Give me a grant. 
BRUCE I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale. 
KNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead: 
KNOX "This is Miss Vale." -- That felt redundant. 
BRUCE (to VICKI) You're just back from Corto Maltese. I saw your combat photos. Quite a departure for you. 
VICKI That's intriguing. They haven't been published yet. 
BRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question. 
BRUCE ... You have an extraordinary eye. 
He's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial instincts aroused, pipes up: 
KNOX Some people think she has two. 
VICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance: 
VICKI Don't mind my friend. He's a little nervous tonight. 
KNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's something formal, maybe even calculating about it -- he could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation of charm. 
This is a man who thinks three moves ahead. KNOX doesn't like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all: 
VICKI (cont.) This is an amazing house. I'd love to shoot it sometime. 
BRUCE I don't... seek publicity. -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while? 
VICKI As far as I know. 
BRUCE Good. Then with any luck we'll run into each other. 
Suddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns. 
ALFRED Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave -- very unexpectedly. He asked me to convey his regrets. 
BRUCE Thank you, Alfred. (to VICKI) I hope you'll excuse me. It was a great pleasure meeting you. (to KNOX) And you. 
Without bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and strides hurriedly out of the room. 
KNOX I know the rich are different, but that guy is real different. 
VICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him. 
KNOX (cont.) Hello? Vicki? 
VICKI Oh. Sorry. I was thinking. 
KNOX What were you thinking? 
VICKI Yum, yum. 
KNOX Well, he must like the way he looks. He's got a mirror in every room. 
And indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to ceiling. 
VICKI I get it. Bruce Vain. 
She pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we 
CUT TO: 
REVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH THE MIRROR 
looking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS -- as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent, state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. 
CLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR 
BLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up. 
BATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk. 
HOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support. A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He does not fall. 
HOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES... planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG. 
ANGLE ON COPS 
staring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk. 
COP LOOK! 
GORDON My God... it's him. 
ANGLE ON CATWALK 
HOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind. BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side. 
He takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF. 
Like a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK to the factory floor forty feet below! 
INT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT 
JACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall; STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting for JACK to make his move. 
No go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind a forklift and darts into the adjacent room. 
INT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER 
JACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out onto the floor in streams. The streams run together... begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE. 
COPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK. 
AN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet. 
INT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER 
COPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor. 
JACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine, hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate opens on the East River. It's the waste dump! 
Up on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor. 
JACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he does -- 
BATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT. 
An instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK... 
VOICE HOLD IT! 
In all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD. 
HOOD V Let him go or I'll do it. 
BATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks. 
All action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move. HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range. 
ECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the Commissioner plugged. 
ANGLE ON JACK 
at a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk. He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling black currents of the East River... and freedom. 
He's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38 AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor of the catwalk mere yards away. 
ANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR 
The HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door. 
HOOD V Nobody makes a move. We go out clean. 
JACK'S VOICE ECKHARDT!! 
ALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops ECKHARDT cleanly. 
The moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE -- a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE. 
The THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor, DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY. 
AN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above. JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS. BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers. 
JACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE. 
A YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE. 
GORDON NO!! 
But the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins, totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING ALL THE WAY. 
GORDON (cont.) Goddammit, we had him. We -- 
BRUCE Too much work. I'm not really the physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred. 
ALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin over braided telephone cables. 
VICKI You do a very convincing imitation. (sipping her drink) Mm, this is tasty. What's yours? 
He smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for her to try a sip. 
VICKI (cont.) ... Ginger ale? 
BRUCE Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops. (beat) Tell me, Vicki. There's something I'm very curious about. What took you down to Corto Maltese? 
VICKI ... I guess I needed a change. 
BRUCE You were one of the most successful magazine photographers in the city. Everyone wanted you. 
VICKI Have you ever been to Corto Maltese? 
BRUCE Not since the shooting started. 
VICKI We went there once when I was little. I played on the beach. And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced with my father on the hotel patio. (shrugging) That was Corto Maltese. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away. 
BRUCE What did you see? 
VICKI ... Terror. 
The conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends. VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE. 
BRUCE There's terror everywhere. Some types are just more -- familiar than others. 
For a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically. 
VICKI I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I know it all seems a million miles away, out here on the water, with all this -- 
BRUCE Insulation? 
VICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her. 
VICKI Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you. 
BRUCE I think you see things very clearly. 
VICKI I'm happy to talk about something else. I don't want to be depressing. 
BRUCE (smiling) Do you assume that if I know you better I won't like you as much? 
VICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen. 
VICKI I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are you like this with the other women you know? -- Because I just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation. 
BRUCE (taking her hand) Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it. 
Bingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before she knows it, VICKI finds herself melting. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GOTHAM CITY OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT 
Rigoletto. THE DUKE onstage, launching into his big crowd-pleaser, "La Donna e Mobile." 
WE PAN THE AUDIENCE, finding several mobile young DONNAS in the crowd -- drop-dead beauties in slinky gowns. Although most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA #1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above the orchestra seats. Her mouth twists in disgust. 
She scans the crowd, finds her counterpart (DONNA #2) some rows back, on the arm of a bald bigwig. DONNA #2 is wearing a similar sour expression, staring up at the same box. 
DONNA #3 is even less discreet than her comrades. She has her opera glasses trained on the couple in the box. 
HER POV - THROUGH OPERA GLASSES - THE BOX 
BRUCE and VICKI. He whispers in her ear. She smiles and whispers back. 
A beat. He whispers again. This time she doesn't laugh. But her lips part slightly. SCREEN GOES BLACK as the opera glasses SNAP SHUT. 
ANGLE ON CROWD - DONNA #3 
staring icily at the DUKE as he finishes up to a round of TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT 
BRUCE and VICKI enter. He takes her coat, drops it on a chair by the door. VICKI is giddy, all champagned up. 
VICKI -- but it's not fair. I'm half drunk and you're not even -- 
BRUCE Would you like me to take you home? 
VICKI God. You would. (sidling up to him) Come on, Bruce. I just want to get two drinks in you. As an experiment. 
BRUCE Maybe we should just kiss. 
VICKI ... We could try that. 
WIDER ANGLE 
BRUCE embracing VICKI in the vastness of the darkened entry hall, framed by long semicircular STAIRWAYS on opposite walls. A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHTNING transports us to: 
GRISSOM Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal -- 
JACK JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?? 
And now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock -- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory. 
His flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS, PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN. 
JACK (cont.) I'm not a Jack any more. (pause; cackling) You made me a Joker! 
THE CACKLE BUILDS INTO FURIOUS, HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER. GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city. 
GRISSOM Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE. 
JACK HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!! 
And with that JACK pulls the trigger. And fires. And fires again until the CLIP IS EMPTY. 
EXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT 
We TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper, arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit. 
INT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The room is still dark. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from this moment on, THE JOKER -- sits in GRISSOM's swivel chair, staring out at the moon-drenched skyline. 
JOKER What a view. Our little city. It always brings a smile to my face. 
He reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself. 
JOKER (cont.) Guess it's my little city now. Wonder what it'll look like when I get done with it. (pause) I bet it'll be something real fine. Real fine and pretty. 
DISSOLVE T0: 
INT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
The sun is just up, and VICKI finds herself alone in bed. A SOFT, OFF-KEY BARITONE VOICE drifts out of the adjacent bathroom: BRUCE in the shower, singing "Honeysuckle Rose." 
She breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. Somehow she's wound up wearing BRUCE's ribbed formal shirt. 
INT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER - MORNING 
BRUCE in his opulent deco shower stall, still SINGING to himself. VICKI sneaks up behind him, opens the door. He instantly STOPS SINGING -- as if he's been hit by a brick. 
VICKI I didn't mean to scare you. I just had to come in here and see it that was really you singing. 
She smiles, teasing him. He doesn't respond. He acts as if she's caught him doing something shameful -- exposed him. 
VICKI (cont.) (singing) "Don't buy sugar -- you just have to touch my cup." Come on. "You're my sugar --" (no response from BRUCE) Bruce, you are such a case. 
BRUCE seems somehow unable to sing along. But be quickly recovers his composure -- and forces a crooked, almost childish smile. 
BRUCE I don't sing very well. 
VICKI Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is. -- Now you'll have to kill me. 
He kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a towel. His body is one big mass of BRUISES AND ABRASIONS. 
VICKI (cont.) Poor thing. You should stay off that horse. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY 
KNOX, in a surly mood, examines the morning edition of the Globe. He's turned to page six -- the gossip page -- and there, under Miranda Reitz's byline, is a picture of VICKI. It seems she and BRUCE are the talk of the town. 
KNOX (disgusted) ...Peanut. 
A COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER: 
COPY BOY Here's that morgue file you wanted. 
KNOX leans back in his chair. The file is labelled "BRUCE WAYNE: 1982-1987."  KNOX opens it and begins to leaf through old clippings from back issues of the Globe. 
WAYNE FOUNDATION TO FUND LOW-COST HOUSING. MILLIONAIRE HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR GOTHAM HANDICAPPED. HURRICANE VICTIMS SAY 'THANK YOU' TO BRUCE WAYNE. KNOX's face sags in dismay. Every article seems to be telling us just how swell a rich philanthropist can be. 
KNOX Come on. Gimme some dirt! 
Then he notices something odd. In the whole fat file of clippings, there are no pictures of Bruce Wayne -- with two partial exceptions. 
One is a group shot, Bruce in the middle, waving at the camera and blocking our view of his face. The other is an ancient picture of a collegiate Bruce, stern-faced, hair down to his collar. The caption reads "BRUCE WAYNE IN 1973" -- years out of date even when it ran in the paper. 
KNOX (cont.) ... Why don't you like your picture taken? 
CUT TO: 
INT. APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT 
A DOORMAN DOZES in the plush lobby of ALICIA HUNT's apartment building on the East Side of Gotham. Through the glass doors we see ALICIA outside in the chill wind, peering inside, hesitant to enter. 
As silently as possible she uses her key and steps in, tiptoeing past the doorman, trying not to wake him. She's almost made it when he SITS BOLT UPRIGHT, startling her. 
DOORMAN Miss Hunt! (smiling) No need to sneak in. The rent's been taken care of. 
ALICIA ... The rent? Paid? 
ON BRUCE AND VICKI 
A PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside them, feeling his way along an imaginary wall. VICKI groans. 
VICKI All street mimes should be executed. 
BRUCE ... Looks like a convention. 
And indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging on the center of the plaza. 
RICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside. 
A BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN. 
SUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers. 
VICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain. 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
BRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION: 
-    TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY and co. up against the glass doors, the other holding the CROWD at bay; 
-    A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement; 
-    PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as OTHER MIMES cruelly mimic their terrified poses... 
... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT. 
He darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN, CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. No privacy. He's practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified. 
A BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER. 
ANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS 
BODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards. 
ANGLE ON BRUCE 
his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. It's almost as if the bullets are striking him. 
A moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him. 
As if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS -- with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension. 
VICKI BRUCE!! 
He blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows. 
BRUCE Oh my God... are you all right? 
He reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back. 
He sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened, pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her face is full of bewilderment and doubt. 
INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN 
ANCHORWOMAN ... live from Halliday Plaza, where a gangland-style execution claimed the life of racketeer Philly Ricorso. Ricorso's death is the third in a rash of underworld killings... 
CUT TO TWO-SHOT: the ANCHORWOMAN and COMMISSIONER GORDON. 
ANCHORWOMAN (cont.) Commissioner, you've heard the rumors. Are these murders the work of the mysterious 'Batman'? 
A PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV, placing us in the JOKER's boardroom. Behind the big desk he SWIVELS INTO VIEW, phone in hand. 
JOKER All reet! I think it's about time we called another meeting, huh? 
CUT TO: 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY 
ALFRED on the phone, a feather duster in his hand. 
ALFRED I'm sorry, Miss Vale. I've given him your messages. That's all I can do. 
ANGLE WIDENS. BRUCE is sitting mere feet away, obviously distraught, locked in some sort of internal struggle. 
INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - DAY 
VICKI Please tell him... I'm not trying to make his life difficult. I'd just -- I'd just like to know what's going on. 
A KNOCK at the door as VICKI hangs up. She goes to open it, finds KNOX -- wearing a big, cheshire-cat smile. 
KNOX Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd like you to see. 
INT. LIBRARY - DAY 
A MICROFILM MACHINE. As VICKI looks on curiously, KNOX -- all eagerness now -- threads up a roll of film and begins cranking through back-issue newspapers. 
KNOX Okay, here we go. Check it out. 
He steps back. VICKI stares down at the display screen. A FRONT-PAGE BANNER HEADLINE reads: 
THOMAS WAYNE MURDERED Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed 
VICKI Then "everyone" must know something I don't. 
CLAIRE (cattily) Oh. Really. Well. -- Come on, dear, Tony's dying to see you. 
In a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular Brit, is shooting a swimsuit layout with two SUPERMODELS. They all ad lib greetings to VICKI as TONY darts around hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses. 
TONY Yes, ladies, smiles, show me those smiles, fabulous, tropical smiles, think Tahiti, I want to see teeth, yes, those glorious teeth -- 
As VICKI looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces. 
TONY (cont.) My God no, don't stop now, those smiles, I need those smiles -- 
Suddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm. 
The MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away. 
TONY (cont.) Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's -- (beat) No! Too far, too far! Pull back, pull back! (dropping the camera) OH MY GOD! 
The SUPERMODELS PITCH TO THE FLOOR, shuddering convulsively, their LIPS drawn back in FRIGHTFUL, FROZEN, LAB-APE GRINS. VICKI GASPS. CLAIRE SCREAMS. TONY SCREAMS. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - EVENING 
The Eyewitness News set, with anchors PATSY NARITA and DAVE McELROY. Behind them, BLOWUPS of the two dead SUPERMODELS. 
PATSY The fashion world was stunned today by the sudden deaths of top models Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg. Cause of death has been attributed to a violent allergic reaction, although authorities have not yet ruled out the possibility of drug use. Dave? 
Behind DAVE, on the bluescreen: a HUGE STATUE, covered in canvas -- not unlike New York's Statue of Liberty. 
DAVE In Gotham, plans continue for the city's 300th birthday celebration. The four-day event will conclude with the unveiling, in Gotham Harbor, of the newly restored 'Lady Gotham'... 
A TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper into frame. 
DAVE (cont.) This bulletin just in. Nine more mysterious deaths at a beauty parlor in -- 
Off to the left, PATSY begins to LAUGH. DAVE FROWNS. 
DAVE (cont.) Patsy! This is hardly the -- (his eyes widen) PATSY!! 
An offscreen CRASH. Suddenly DAVE is up out of his seat, mouth agape in horror. 
PATSY HAS GONE INTO CONVULSIONS. CAMERA WHIPS VIOLENTLY RIGHT AND LEFT as she jerks out of her seat and TOTTERS UNCONTROLLABLY across the set, LAUGHING INSANELY. 
TECHNICIANS rush the soundstage in an unrehearsed frenzy. PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the newsdesk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face. 
DAVE gestures frantically to the cameraman: 
DAVE (cont.) KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE -- 
Suddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A moment later, we're looking at: 
SPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS 
Their gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS as a BOUNCY TUNE -- "Put on a Happy Face" -- comes up underneath. 
MODELS (CARTOON VOICE) ... Love that Joker! 
INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY 
THEME MUSIC CONTINUES as a grinning, deranged pitchman -- THE JOKER -- pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. The shelves are filled with products bearing his TRADEMARK HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music. 
INT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT 
PANICKED TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has been JAMMED. Every monitor shows THE JOKER'S COMMERCIAL. 
DIRECTOR WHERE'S IT COMING FROM?? 
TECHNICIAN I DON'T KNOW! 
CLOSEUP - THE JOKER 
JOKER ... new improved Joker brand. With the secret ingredient... SMYLENOL! (a sweep of the hand) Let's go to our blind taste test. 
TIGHT ON an anonymous MAN -- GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied to his chair, squirming, struggling. On the table before him is a package labelled "BRAND X." A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: "NOT AN ACTOR." 
JOKER (cont.) Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of sorts. (wagging a finger) He's been using Brand X! But with new improved Joker brand... 
ANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY. 
JOKER (cont.) ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!! 
EXT. IDYLLIC PASTORAL SETTING - DAY 
THE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY. 
JOKER (cont.) -- and the world smiles with you! Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable -- 
He grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss. 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
Television sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react to the JOKER's maniacal promo. 
JOKER I know what you're saying. Where can I buy these fine, fine products? Well, that's the gag, folks, you never know. Chances are... you've bought 'em already!!! 
She hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent. 
TRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad. 
VICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth. Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room. 
INT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT 
GREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold. 
The mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT. 
A SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a "CLOSED" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE CANS OF BLACK PAINT. 
The JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with an appreciative eye. 
JOKER Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds. 
He stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas. 
He ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons, pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment. Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed. 
He cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's "THE SCREAM." 
JOKER (cont.) I kinda like this one. Leave it. 
INT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING 
VICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark. The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair. 
JOKER I think it's safe to take that off. 
VICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes the gas mask, tries to gather her wits. 
JOKER (cont.) You're quite beautiful. 
VICKI ... Thank you. 
JOKER Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it. 
He sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry Lewis-style, as he lights the candles. 
JOKER (cont.) You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know who I am. -- Is this your portfolio? 
She nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the Globe, at first. Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities. Artier B&W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions. 
JOKER (cont.) Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap... Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye. 
He's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese. 
JOKER (cont.) The panic. The bloody skulls. The armless screaming fellows... you know, the atrocities. (smirking) Somehow, when you shoot it, it all comes out so clean, so lovely. 
VICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway. 
JOKER (cont.) I guess I'm just an old cornball, but... I live for beauty. I look around at my little city, it gets me down. (indicating the photos) We don't have anything like this. Well, it came to me that what this city needs... is beautification. Kind of a big makeover. (enraptured) Miss Vale, I finally realized that one man can make a difference. You know the saying. "In his image... created he them"? 
VICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary, getting more frightened by the minute. 
VICKI And you want a -- 
JOKER A visual record, yes. A before-and- after kind of thing. (leaning closer) This could make your reputation. 
Her first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the impulse. She won't run... not until she gets this maniac on film. She reaches for her camera bag. 
VICKI Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup. 
JOKER (momentarily puzzled) ... Behind the makeup? 
Then it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse job, he looks practically normal. VICKI must think she's looking at his real face! 
JOKER (cont.) Oh. Yes. I see what you mean. 
He finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then -- suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER: 
JOKER (cont.) Silly little TWIT -- I can't take you ANYWHERE! 
He sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes. 
He obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he POINTS at the WATER GLASS: 
JOKER (cont.) Well? What are you waiting for?? 
Now VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE. 
His hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE. 
His awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the running makeup, he LEERS at her. 
JOKER (cont.) You see, Miss Vale -- that was my makeup. (leaning forward) What do you think? 
VICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out. 
VICKI I've seen worse. Much worse. 
JOKER Strong stomach, huh? I like that in a woman. -- Maybe we can do business after all. 
The engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the cockpit alongside VICKI. 
Guns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of the alley at ninety miles an hour. 
THE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off. 
JOKER I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!! 
The JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled "MONARCH PLAYING CARDS."  Half his GOONS pile into the van behind him, the other half into a second car nearby. 
EXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT 
SIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim. 
INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT 
roaring out into CITY TRAFFIC. 
VICKI Look! Police! 
BATMAN I called them. 
VICKI Shouldn't we -- 
A POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response. 
INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT 
TIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out from the front of the van. 
GOON There they are! Dead ahead! 
THE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE. 
JOKER ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW! 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
The JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH, BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the streets, eager to join the chase. 
SERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS 
COP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path. 
INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT 
PEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE PAVEMENT. 
VICKI What about her? What about the girl? 
BATMAN He won't kill her. (gritting his teeth) GODDAMMIT! 
They're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION. 
BATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST. And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on collision with a lamppost. 
He jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast. 
ONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a crowd around them. 
VICKI Can't we -- 
BATMAN Too many people. Come on! (as she scrambles out) SHIELDS!! 
The BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies: 
COMPUTER Shields. 
With a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL. 
BATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE, vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble. 
INT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT 
THREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE. 
GOON AT WHEEL Are they ours? 
JOKER ... I don't know. We'd better get out of here. (into RADIO MIKE) Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY?? 
The VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately down the street. 
EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
BATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands, dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS. 
INT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT 
FOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio: 
GOON I We got 'em! 
JOKER (V.O.) (over radio) Take 'em! I want his head! 
EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
BATMAN (cont.) They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights. 
VICKI I don't like bats. Not that kind. 
BATMAN They used to terrify me. But I forced myself to keep coming back, and -- (smiling) -- I guess I became the thing I feared the most. I'll do your photos now. 
He goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the roll. 
VICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound. 
She looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is dedicated. 
VICKI Who pays for all this? 
BATMAN I have sponsors. 
VICKI The computers? 
BATMAN I'm running a check on the tainted products. There is a pattern. Beauty products. Personal hygiene. 
VICKI No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll all be showing our true faces now. 
She looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request. But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand. 
BATMAN I've tracked all the records. Every shipment, every warehouse, every loading dock. Nothing. No opportunities for tampering. Somehow the Joker is supplying tainted ingredients... at the source. 
VICKI Wait. You can just tap into any corporate database you want? Anywhere? 
BATMAN Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos are ready. 
He holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints. 
VICKI You could've killed him, you know. You could have killed the Joker. 
BATMAN I had to save you, Vicki. (turning to face her) Here you go. I think I'll let you keep the whole set. 
She looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but there's no clean angle on his face. 
VICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling. 
BATMAN (cont.) Care for an autograph? 
He takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her with the inscription: "TO VICKI. LOVE, B." 
Now he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS. 
VICKI ... Bruce? 
HE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then: 
BATMAN Are you talking to me? 
He turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing. 
BATMAN (cont.) Maybe we've had enough for one night. I'll take you home. 
Almost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE. 
BATMAN (cont.) Do you want to do it this time? 
VICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as he walks over to the driver's side and gets in. 
BATMAN (cont.) Don't be afraid. I'm here. 
She takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP. 
FLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after- burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE) 
The red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE: liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters emerge from the opening of a hit musical. 
In the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep, head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder. 
THOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking. 
IN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF JOY. And then, without warning -- 
A HANDGUN enters frame. 
The WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet, begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight. 
MARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at her throat. 
The GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move. 
The GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE. 
The instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward the sidewalk. 
A SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun. 
THOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek we cannot hear -- 
EXT. GOTHAM PARK - LATE AFTERNOON 
The weekend-long BIRTHDAY GALA is getting underway, and Gotham Park is mobbed with CELEBRANTS enjoying a FREE CONCERT. Onstage: FIVE ELVIS IMITATORS, dressed in everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits, representing the King in progressive stages of deterioration. 
INT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DUSK 
She's on the sofa beside a disconsolate BRUCE. 
VICKI ... So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- (frightened) You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you? 
BRUCE It wouldn't matter much. 
VICKI I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne. 
He sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the same argument with himself a thousand times. 
BRUCE Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself. -- I'm extraneous to the process. 
VICKI You're one man. You can't save everybody. 
BRUCE What it I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one? 
VICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY: 
VICKI Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself. 
BRUCE (staring right at her) Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save. 
VICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen. 
VICKI Oh, God. I've got to have some coffee or something. 
A moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting. Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door. 
VICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder. 
BRUCE Are you expecting anyone? 
She nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door. 
BRUCE (cont.) Who's there? 
THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY. 
DELIVERY BOY Package tor Miss Vale. 
BRUCE Set it down by the door. On the left-hand side. 
The DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off, tipless, muttering something about "cheap shits." After a moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick up the mysterious package. 
Another brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON. 
VICKI BRUCE! 
He strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets it down on the kitchen counter. 
VICKI (cont.) It's just like the last time. He sent me a present before he -- 
BRUCE Very thoughtful. Don't touch it. 
As VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT. 
VICKI Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you. 
BRUCE I feel naked without it. 
He takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package. 
BRUCE (cont.) Not a bomb. But it could be rigged. Wait in the next room. 
He takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife. 
Nothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR. 
In the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal. 
BRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the counter. 
BRUCE ... They're wax. 
VICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears. 
VICKI "It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make up. I'll need you soon." -- Whew. 
BRUCE (lost in thought) That does it. It's going to be this weekend. 
The KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver. Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over. 
INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT 
ALICIA, in her porcelain mask, on the phone. 
ALICIA I thought you ought to know -- he's coming for you... 
ON BRUCE AND VICKI 
The VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS: 
JOKER Slow down, you maniac! 
EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING 
As the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist. His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands directly behind him on the horse's back. 
BRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider. The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off. 
INT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT 
ALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below, UNMARKED CARS are converging. 
INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT 
The JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building. 
DRIVER Boss! Jesus! They've -- 
JOKER They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE! 
EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING 
BRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones, drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt. 
EXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING 
A YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph. 
INT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT 
We can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect sync with the one on BRUCE's belt. 
EXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT 
BRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past -- 
-- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE, neatly tied in string. 
BRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick salute -- and the BUG is gone. 
INT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING 
The JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger. 
JOKER MOVE! Can't you do something?? 
DRIVER It's some kind of detour. They're backed up for blocks! 
The JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD. 
JOKER Oh my God. How does he do it... ? 
EXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT 
THE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER. 
INT. VAN - THAT MOMENT 
THE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS, RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO GOTHAM PARK ITSELF. 
BATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from overhead. 
EXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING 
CROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone: 
EMCEE -- the most spectacular, most death- defying aerial stunt ever devised. Tonight -- for the first time anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS! 
He points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart. 
ANGLE ON HELICOPTERS 
ONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters. 
EXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL 
PANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly. 
On each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN -- driving it off the access road down into the brush, where it nearly topples over sideways. 
ANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS 
GRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair, landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make the return leap back to his own trapeze. 
INT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT 
In the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen, compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents, he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase. 
PILOT Ready to go, Dick? 
DICK What's all the ruckus down there? 
EXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT 
INSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN 
A taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment. COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g. 
REPORTER ... on a tip attributed to the mysterious Batman. The apartment was booby-trapped with the Joker's laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen dead. (beat) Also found dead at the scene was Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model -- 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty. 
We move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION, showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and, as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE. Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY. 
Yet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. 
And, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly... he would just as soon be dead. 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY 
DICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed, unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt. 
Breaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby. 
DICK ... Where am I? 
BRUCE My name is Bruce Wayne. You're welcome to stay here as long as you want. 
BRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on here? 
INT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY 
Beneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument. 
DENT We'll send a team into Ace the moment the warrant comes through. 
BRUCE He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment. 
DENT All right, Bruce, what do you suggest? 
BRUCE I suggest a nice big bomb. 
DENT Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws. 
BRUCE Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration. 
DENT We've told him we'll deal. What could he possibly have to gain by -- 
BRUCE Do you still think the Joker cares about money?? 
DENT I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all your expert sources. 
Mexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back a moment, then turns down the hall. 
EXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
The ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut. 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY 
A glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps, then climbs out and towels himself off. 
He looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order. 
INT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY 
An OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway behind him. 
DICK ... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride so I figured I'd hoof it. 
BRUCE Sorry. I can't let you leave. 
DICK You can't keep me here, man. That's kidnapping. 
BRUCE If I let you leave, you'll do the same thing again. You'll go after the Joker... and you'll wind up dead. (turning to go) 
DICK Hey, man. Look at you. You're rich. You got everything you want. How do you know what's in my mind? 
BRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling. 
BRUCE I don't care what's in your mind. You're staying. 
BRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL. 
DICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a move or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him. 
A second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back. 
INT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT 
ALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom. 
INT. GUEST BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT 
DICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air. He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet. Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE... who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie. 
A long, tense moment passes between them. Then: 
DICK ... You're him. 
HOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with its grating electronic WHINE. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT 
The trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's forces. 
INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge shipment. At an open loading bay, we find a DISPATCHER with a clipboard, directing MORE UNMARKED TRUCKS in the lot outside. 
DISPATCHER Boston, Philly: loading bay one. 
EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and taking half the chain-link fence with it. 
In the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole in the door. 
INT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE. 
CRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER. 
INT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT 
BULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It doesn't matter. The car is empty. No one's driving. 
TRACK IN on the computer console -- where a familiar tinny voice calmly repeats its pre-programmed command: 
COMPUTER ... Detonate. 
A beat. Then: BLAM. 
INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
A CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing to raid the plant. Inside each car: SPECIAL UNIT COPS dressed in asbestos suits, gas masks in their laps. 
All at once, a BRILLIANT RED GLARE suffuses the sky. 
COP Good Lord! 
EXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
THE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS. For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then -- 
All that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - NIGHT 
DAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas, ready to be unveiled. 
THOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie- talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's just another part of the celebration. 
At the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a microphone: 
GOVERNOR GILROY As Governor of this great state, it is now my honor to unveil for you a very special lady -- a lady who stands tall for life and liberty -- America's favorite lady... LADY GOTHAM! 
The CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon: hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face... 
... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!! 
Suddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic: the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES. 
And across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS GOING DARK. 
EXT. GOTHAM SKIES - AERIAL SHOTS - NIGHT 
QUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE: 
JOKER (V.O.) HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a little token of my esteem. HAVE FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME! 
INSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY! 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
ANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR. 
DARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS, DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks. 
On the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING. 
FLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies... only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
In a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her. 
KNOX VICKI! 
VICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger. 
KNOX GIMME A HAND UP HERE! 
VICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM... 
... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!! 
INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT 
BATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT. 
BATMAN'S MOUTH drops open. He understands. 
EXT. AVENUE - ON JOKER'S FLOAT - THAT MOMENT 
THE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON. 
He hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face... 
... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM! The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to the ground! 
JOKER No... NOOOOO!!! 
ANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON 
as it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it disperses harmlessly in the wind. 
EXT. AVENUE - THAT MOMENT 
THE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession; hits a button repeatedly... 
... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a fit of pique. 
A SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street. 
CABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on helplessly, in stunned disbelief. 
As he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL. 
JOKER There. There. -- GET 'EM!! 
ANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK 
A SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS. 
KNOX GET THE CAR! 
The JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction. 
GUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT. 
INT. FORD ESCORT - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER 
KNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done. 
KNOX HOLY SHIT!! 
VICKI You okay? 
KNOX Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?! 
VICKI (laughing wildly) God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever -- 
KNOX (ecstatic) Holy shit. Holy -- 
He GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between his lips -- and BURSTS. 
VICKI ALLIE!! 
His hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He looks down in genuine bewilderment. 
KNOX Jesus, Vicki. 
That quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face. 
EXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT 
In the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea. 
EXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT 
THE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue, past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear through a CONCEALED HATCH. 
WOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the parade decorations. And one moment later... 
A ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue! 
INT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT 
BATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank, leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range. 
INT. TANK - THAT MOMENT 
THE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR- SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can hear him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons. 
EXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT 
INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT 
A tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed. 
The JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie: 
JOKER I'm in the belltower. Don't land. 
INT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT 
A PILOT replies through his radio headset. 
PILOT E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on. 
The PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc. 
INT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
BATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead. Dried blood cakes his face, his chest. 
Dizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule back onto his dry, swollen tongue. 
Quaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten wood of the belltower stairs. 
THE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him. And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step. 
It would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING, vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell. 
Then he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away. His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS. 
For a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching, trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last ounce of strength. 
The trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile. BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it. 
He reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at his side. 
THE BATMAN is out like a light. 
INT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT 
The JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs. 
JOKER ... Batman? 
No reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS BATMAN up into the belltower. 
He props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- pats his face. 
JOKER (cont.) Batman? Batman? 
THE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak. 
JOKER (cont.) I thought you'd be more comfortable here in the belfry. (chuckling to himself) Before I kill you I'd like to see who you are. Would that be okay? 
BATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes and reaches over to undo his cowl. 
BRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face. 
JOKER (cont.) Oh my, aren't we pretty. (brightening suddenly) I know you! You're the rich boy!! 
The JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps his hands together in sheer glee. 
JOKER (cont.) My goodness, what in the world made you do it? It must've been something pretty terrible! 
He's practically dancing now. He's made a friend. 
JOKER (cont.) You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously. 
BATMAN Mad... man... 
JOKER Well now, you're not exactly the picture of mental health, are you. 
BATMAN ... Murderer... 
JOKER Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live. 
A SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his helicopter approaching in the distance. 
BRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins. 
The JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens it gingerly. 
JOKER (cont.) I have to do it now, Bruce, but it won't even hurt. Now relax. The bat's in his belfry, all's right with the world... 
He has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection. 
JOKER (cont.) Why, Bruce... 
Then he hears ticking. 
Looks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt. 0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds. 
He SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR. 
BRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry.

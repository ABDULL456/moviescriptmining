Michael Mann 
SECOND DRAFT July 20, 1984 
EXT. MARATHON, FLORIDA, BEACH - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - DAY 
The highlit aqua water burns out sections of the two men imposed in front of it. The beach is white sand. JACK CRAWFORD -- mid-forties, large -- came down from Washington. His suitcoat over the driftwood log and his rolled-up white sleeves says City, not Florida Keys. WILL GRAHAM -- late thirties -- in a faded Hawaiian number and sun-bleached vio- let shorts, belongs. Graham smokes. Crawford drinks from a glass of iced tea. Then: 
CRAWFORD I should have caught you at the boat yard when you got off work. You don't want to talk about it here... 
GRAHAM I don't want to talk about it anywhere. (beat) If you brought pictures, leave them in the briefcase. Molly and Kevin will be back soon. 
CRAWFORD How much do you know? 
GRAHAM What was in the 'Miami Herald' and the 'Times.' (beat) Confessions? 
CRAWFORD Eighty-six so far. All cranks. He smashes the mirrors and uses the pieces. (beat) None of them knew that; 
GRAHAM What else did you keep out of the papers? 
CRAWFORD Blond, right-handed, really strong, wears a size eleven shoe. The prints are all smooth gloves. He's on a full moon cycle. Both times. His blood is AB Positive. 
GRAHAM Somebody hurt him? 
CRAWFORD Typed him from semen. He's a secretor. 
Crawford takes a sip of the iced tea and looks at Graham. 
Graham flips his cigarette into the surf. CRAWFORD Will... you saw this in the papers. The second one was all over TV. Did you ever think about givin' me a call? 
GRAHAM No. 
CRAWFORD Why not? 
GRAHAM The Bureau already has the best lab. Plus you have Bloom at the University of Chicago... 
CRAWFORD And I got you down here fixing fuckin' boat motors. 
GRAHAM You don't need me. I wouldn't be useful to you anymore, Jack. 
CRAWFORD Last two like this we had, you caught. 
GRAHAM That was three years ago. And by doing the same things you and the rest of them at the lab are doing. 
CRAWFORD That's not entirely true, Will. It's the way you think. 
GRAHAM I think there has been a lot of bullshit about the way I think. (beat) I came down here to get away from all that. 
CRAWFORD You look all right now. 
GRAHAM I am all right. 
Crawford pulls two pictures from his shirt pocket. He keeps them face down. They draw at Will. Crawford knows this. 
CRAWFORD If you can't look anymore, I understand... 
GRAHAM As long as they're dead... 
CRAWFORD These are all dead, Will. 
PICTURES 
If we expected gory crime photos, these are not them. Two snapshots: a woman followed by three children and a duck carrying picnic items up a bank of a pond. A second family behind a birthday cake at a table. They're all smiling. 
CLOSE: GRAHAM 
looks at the pictures for a full twenty seconds. Then he puts them down and looks along the beach. 
GRAHAM'S POV: MOLLY + KEVIN 
KEVIN -- lanky and tall at eleven -- hunkers down at the water's edge, 50 yards away examining something in the sand. MOLLY -- suntanned, blonde and sensuous at thirty stands watching the two men, her hand on her hip. Waves careen around her ankles. Her body language openly states hostility. It's towards Crawford. 
GRAHAM (O.S.) Let's talk after dinner. Stay and eat. 
CRAWFORD (O.S.) I'LL come back later. I got messages at the Holiday Inn to collect 
Molly starts walking forward. On it... CUT TO: INT. GRAHAM'S KITCHEN - MOLLY + GRAHAM - NIGHT are doing dishes. Graham wipes while Molly washes. 
MOLLY He stopped by to see me at the shop before he came out here. 
GRAHAM What did he want? 
MOLLY He asked how you are. 
GRAHAM And you said? 
MOLLY I said you are fine, he should leave you the hell alone. 
walk through the kitchen as if he knows where he is going. A thermostat clicks and air conditioning comes on loudly. Graham's feet pass our of frame... 
INT. LEEDS HOUSE, SECOND STORY - FLOOR 
is empty. The carpet is dark. We hear Graham's footsteps up the stairs. Then his feet enter the frame and a flash- light beam hits the carpet. It dwells on a couple of dark stains. Track with Graham's feet to the entry to the master bedroom. The bedroom is dark. We see nothing. 
INT. LEEDS MASTER BEDROOM - LIGHT SWITCH Graham's hand enters. He hits the light switch. 
BLOOD 
screams at us from the walls. 
CLOSE: GRAHAM doesn't visibly react. 
WIDER - GRAHAM moves into the room. The bloodstains are extensive. Half the walls look like a monochromatic Jackson Pollock. The mirrors are smashed. Taped outlines on the mattress indi- cate where the bodies had been found. Graham opens the file he carries containing autopsy, lab and crime reports. 
OVERHEAD ANGLE - GRAHAM 
standing alone in the middle of the master bedroom. The crime scene -- the disarray, the big splashes of arterial blood on the walls, the smashed mirrors, taped outlines or bodies -- is a testament to a violence that is pornographic. Graham pulls out a tape recorder and starts dictating his own notes, thumbing through various reports for reference. 
GRAHAM intruder entered through kitchen sliding door. Probably a glass cutter. Why didn't he care that he left AB saliva on the glass? it was hot out that night. inside, the house must' have been pleasantly cool to him. (beat) The intruder cut Charles Leeds' throat as he lay asleep beside Mrs. Leeds. He shot Mrs. Leeds as she was rising... Bullet entered the right of her navel and lodged in her lumbar spine, but she died of strangulation... increase of serotonin and free histimine levels in the gunshot wound indicates... she lived at least five minutes after she was shot... All her other injuries were post-mortem. (beat> Then he went toward the children's room. (beat) Direction and velocity of blood stains on the east wall indicate arterial spray.;. With his throat cut, Mr. Leeds still tried to fight. Because the intruder was moving to the children's room... (beat) in the children's room the intruder shot the first boy in bed. Second boy was found in bed, but dustballs indicate he was dragged out from under his bed to be shot... (MORE) 
GRAHAM (CONT'D) (beat) Profusion of bloodstains and matted sliding marks on hall carpet and west wall of master bedroom remain unexplained... as does superficial ligature mark around Mr. Leed's chest, believed to be post-mortem. What did the killer do with them after they were dead? And before he put the boys back in their beds? 
CUT TO: 
ZNT. LEEDS BATHROOM - MEDICINE CABINET - NIGHT 
is dark. We see nothing. Light comes on. Graham enters. He rests his hands on the sides of the sink. He turns on the water. He pops two pills, cups his hands under the faucet and drinks. He looks at himself in the mirror. Be is breathing normally. Over his shoulder he sees... 
ZOOM INTO: MRS. LEEDS' PANTYHOSE 
still hanging on a towel railing over the bathtub. Graham is staring at the normal domesticity of a family bathroom. He doesn't let it unnerve him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LEEDS' HOUSE; PORCH ROOF - WIDE - NIGHT 
The window opens and Graham climbs onto the porch roof and sits on the gritty shingles. We're looking for a distressed reaction. There is none. Graham is clamped down. Beyond him, the lights of Atlanta and the stars are brilliant... More brilliant than they ought to be. The Delta Aquirid meteor shower's at its maximum This is not a normal image. He takes out his tape recorder again. 
GRAHAM There's a wicker dog bed on the back porch. There's a doghouse in the back yard. Where's the dog? 
HOLD ON Graham. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ATLANTA HYATT HOUSE, ELEVATOR - WIDE - NIGHT 
Graham riding up with two half-drunk CONVENTIONEERS with big "Hi" badges. One Conventioneer is looking over at the lobby below. 
A good-looking woman in a floral dress walks underneath them. Graham is leaning against the glass. 
CONVENTIONEER #1 ...like to rip me off a piece of that! 
CONVENTIONEER #2 Fuck her 'til her nose bleeds. 
The other cracks up. 
GRAHAM 
snaps alert and stares at Conventioneer #2. 
CONVENTIONEER #2 
sips his gin and tonic, senses Graham's stare. He smiles: 
CONVENTIONEER #1 What the fuck are you lookin' at? 
Graham looks away. The elevator stops. The door opens. Conventioneer #1 drags Conventioneer #2. 
CONVENTIONEER #l (being pulled out of elevator) What are you, a faggot? 
Both Conventioneers laugh as they walk down the hall. Conventioneer #1 wiggles his fat hips and apes a limp wrist Graham looks away. 
CUT TO: 
ZNT. HOLIDAY ZNN ROOM - VTR MONITOR: LEEDS FAMILY - NIGHT 
We are seeing a videotape transfer of the Leeds family home movie. Mr. Leeds and Mrs. Leeds are behind the table while the youngest boy is in the center. His brother sits next to him. The birthday cake has eleven candles on it. All are mouthing silently: "Happy Birthday to you, happy birth- day to you..." Mrs. Leeds has her arms crossed underneath her breasts. She's a young mother, sensual and warm. She's smiling. The camera must be on a tripod because Mr. Leeds runs into the frame tousles his son's hair and kisses his wife's cheek. He has thinning hair. He's a big man. He looks like a nice guy. He darts out of the frame back to the camera. They finish singing. The youngest Leeds boy blows out the candles. Mr. Leeds holds up for the camera a large yellow envelope that says: "Follow the ribbon." A big yellow ribbon is attached to the envelope. 
The camera pans right as the youngest Leeds boy starts to follow the ribbon... The image suddenly ours out. Video noise. 
GRAHAM 
has hit the stop button. He picks up a measured field sketch of the master bedroom. The bloodstains are represented in outline. Three are along the left wall. The arterial splashes from Mr. Leeds are on the right wall. Mr. and Mrs. Leeds' body positions are indicated on the king-size mat- tress. 
GRAHAM (into the tape recorder) When they were dead -- except possibly Mrs. Leeds -- he smashed the mirrors and began selecting shards that he used later on Mrs. Leeds... What did he do in the interval? Struggling with Mr. Leeds and killing the others would take less than a minute. What else? (beat) Three bloodstains on the east wall, not from Mr. Leed's arterial spray. What did killer do after they were dead? 
Graham can't go any further. He is frustrated. He picks up the phone and dials. He waits. Then: 
GRAHAM (into phone) Molly? 
MOLLY (V.O.) (asleep) Huh? (beat) Will? Is that you? 
GRAHAM It's me. I'll call you tomorrow, sweetheart. Go back to sleep. (beat) I love you... 
Dr. Princi joins them. 
SPRINGFIELD (to Graham) The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecter three years ago. (beat) He killed nine people, didn't he? 
GRAHAM Nine that we know of. Two didn't die. 
SPRINGFIELD What happened to them? 
GRAHAM One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver. 
SPRINGFIELD What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecter? 
GRAHAM Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him. 
SPRINGFIELD What would you call him? 
Graham doesn't answer. 
SPRINGFIELD To yourself... 
GRAHAM I call him a monster. 
SPRINGFIELD I understand he cut you pretty good... 
GRAHAM (cold right turn> What about the dog? 
SPRINGFIELD It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl. 
GRAHAM Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it? 
SPRINGFIELD No. 
GRAHAM Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog? 
CRAWFORD (alert) A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it. 
GRAHAM Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it. 
Crawford starts to move. The PHONE RINGS. Springfield answers. SPRINGFIELD Yeah? (waits) Lemme put you on the speaker phone. 
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) Who am I talking to? 
CRAWIIORD Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and you got Will Graham here. 
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) I got a partial with a tented arch that's probably a thumb print and a fragment of a palm. 
Springfield reacts. 
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) Came off the oldest kid's left eye. It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound. 
CRAWFORD Can you make an identification off it? 
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) Don't know. The palm came off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe. I want to work these up in my own darkroom. I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon. Hangs up. 
SPRINGFIELD thought Graham was ridiculous. Now his expression is very changed. 
GRAHAM 
senses Springfield's staring at him. Graham's face is blank. He leaves. Springfield -- shaking Crawford's hand -- watches Graham all the way to the door. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ATLANTA POLICE HEADQUARTERS - GRAHAM s CRAWFORD - DAY 
coming down the stairs. News media are all over Springfield, the Commissioner, the Mayor's P.R. Officer in the b.g. No- body recognizes Crawford and Graham except one short man, who separates himself from the pack and darts up to them. He is LOUNDS. He starts chasing behind them. 
LOUNDS Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie Lounds? I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler. I did the paperback... ! 
CLOSE: GRAHAM 
walking down the stairs. His face is locked like a steel trap. He's repressing something powerful. 
LOUNDS (running on, behind them) When did they call you in, Will? What have you got? 
Graham won't answer him. They are on the sidewalk by now. 
CRAWFORD Lounds, give it a rest... 
LOUNDS Come on, Graham?! Talk to me! 
Graham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now. Crawford tries to block Lounds. Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham: 
LOUNDS How does this guy compare with Lecter? How does he do them? 
Right now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to turn him around. 
GRAHAM 
Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under him and throws him over the hood of a car upside-down. The impact STARS the WINDSHIELD Lounds is scared to death. The violence totally surprises us. Graham's face is inches from Lounds. 
GRAHAM (very low) Keep the fuck away from me! 
Crawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham lets go. 
WIDER: CRAWFORD PULLING GRAHAM AWAY 
CUT TO: 
INT. L1011, COACH SECTION - CRAHAM - DAY 
Squeezed into a narrow seat. He sits on the aisle. Next to him is a seven-year-old girl, at the window her mother. He opens and reads a Telex in yellow envelope: "BIRMINGHAM P.D. FOUND JACOBI CAT DEAD IN BACK YARD. KIDS MUST HAVE BURIED IT. HE KILLS THE PETS. REGARDS, CRAWFORD." 
STEWARDESS Clears the trays. 
GRAHAM 
contorts his body to pull his briefcase from under the seat in front. He extracts the Leeds and Jacobi files. From each he takes a snapshot of a happy family picture and paperclips them to the front of the files. He stands them on the dinner tray and stares at them. 
GRAHAM'S POV: HAPPY FAMILY PORTRAITS 
SLOWLY ZOOM IN TO the Jacobi family. As we get CLOSER and CLOSER TO Mrs. Jacobi in a bikini, her face abstracts into pointillist dots of color... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MARATHON BOATYARD - DIESEL ENGINE - DAY moves down to us... 
MOLLY 
approaches in SLOW MOTION raising a bag of shrimp and a six- pack of Dos Equis. 
INT. UNFINISHED HULL - GRAHAM 
guiding the engine down, wears faded violet shorts and no shirt. We see a huge circular scar ending in a hook on his abdomen as the engine lands... 
GRAHAM (reverb, distant) Block her off, Mitch... 
Graham waves to Molly... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
GRAHAM 
On the dock. The hot sun turns the water a brilliant aqua and silver. Graham's tan body in the violet shorts on the silver wood... Molly reaches in the bag for another shrimp. Graham looks at her... 
MOLLY SMILES 
as she rips the head off the shrimp. The warm mouth, Her shiny teeth look like a Pepsodent commercial. 
HEAD COMING OFF SHRIMP 
Viscera trail. As the shrimp is ripped apart we see: 
GRAHAM'S EYES In horror. And O.S., we hear SCREAMING coming from a differ- ent place as we... CUT TO: 
INT. L1011 - GRAHAM - DAY 
snaps awake. The child next to Graham is screaming. People stare. The mother is shouting at him. Graham is confused, stunned... He doesn't know what's wrong. He looks around... The Stewardess is handling things on his tray in front of him. 
TRAY 
The file has spilled open. Crime photos of the Leeds and Jacobi families with mirrors in their eyes and the almost separated head of Mr. Jacobi glaring at a weird angle -- the pornography of it all -- are spilled across Graham's tray and in his lap... 
GRAHAM 
mumbles apologies, scrambles to collect crime photos. The mother wants her seat changed. 
Graham is excruciatingly embarrassed, clumsily shoving them back into their files... CUT TO: 
INT. JACOBI HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - WIDE ON DOOR - DAY 
We MOVE INTO the knob... it starts to turn. Slowly. Sud- denly: door SLAMS open revealing real estate agent GEEHAN and Graham, 
GEEHAN It was last Thursday. This couple from Duluth. I had them down to the short strokes talking mortgages -- I mean, that man could have written a check for the whole goddamn place. I'm figuring: Geehan , you lucky sonofabitch, you gonna unload this turkey. (beat) Then the squad car rolls up. They ask a coupla questions. The good officers give them the whole fuckin' guided tour. Who was laying where. Where all the blood sprayed... terrific! (beat) Off they go in their Sedan DeVille the hell out of here. 
GRAHAM Have any single men asked to look at it? 
GEEHAN Haven't asked me. (beat) Took four coats of interior latex, five in places. (pause) You can drop that key in the mailbox. You don't have to come back by, do you? 
GRAHAM Uh-uh. 
Geehan leaves. The door closes with a SLAM. 
WIDE - GRAHAM 
In the empty white living room. Graham walks OUT OF FRAME. Bare floors and dead air. His footsteps echo in the empty house. CUT TO: 
EXT. JACOBI HOUSE - WIDE - DAY An image from Bill Owens' "Suburbia." A family house. No different than any other family house around. But it is somehow sinister in its vacancy. It ought to be littered with bicycles and wagons: the signs and symbols of suburban normalcy. TRACK LEFT to reveal the back of Graham staring at the house from across the street. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEXT DOOR HOUSE - GRAHAM - DAY 
In a different position staring at the rear of the house from a neighbor's bushes. We don't know why Graham is staring at the Jacobi house from different vantage points. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SIDEROAD - GRAHAM'S POV: 3/4 VIEW OF JACOBI HOUSE DAY 
Graham looking at the house from the third vantage point. 
JACOBI BACKYARD 
GRAHAM (V.O.) The mark? Yes. 
CRAWFORD If the Documents section can't do it... I'll send it up to Langley... 
GRAHAM (V,O.) Did Price get anywhere with the single prints off the Leeds? 
As another line on Crawford's phone rings, we PULL BACK to his secretary, SARAH's area. 
SARAH                            CRAWFORD (fading up)                      (fading down) Special Agent Crawford's       No. The killer's not in office..                       the Single Print Index. He must never have been printed. 
TIGHTEN ON Sarah. We don't hear what's said to her. 
SARAH No, Mr. Graham is not in the office, bur let me... (beat) Wait, I'll be glad to... (beat) Yes, he'll be in the office later, but let me... 
She holds the receiver as though it had died in her hand and crosses into Crawford's office. 
CRAWFORD (to Graham) ... bur if we find him, the print as evidence will get a conviction, Hold on. What? 
SARAH He asked for Will. He said he might call back tonight. I tried to hold him... I'm sorry... He said 'tell Graham "broken mirrors."' 
CRAWFORD (to Graham) Will. Get right back here. He just called. 
EXT. JACOBI HOUSE - GXAHAM - DAY 
GRAHAM Who did he ask for? 
CBAWFORD (V.O.) You. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WASHINGTON FBI OFFICE - CRAWFORD + GRAHAM- LATER 
It's now sunset out the window. Both men are tense. On Crawford's desk are two new telephones and a tape recorder. Also in the room are Sarah and DR. SIDNEY BLOOM, a forensic psychologist. Food wrappings and Styrofoam coffee cups litter his desk. Bloom only ate half his pastrami on rye: 
DR. BLOOM Anybody want the rest of the cholesterol special? 
CRAWFORD Thanks, no. 
GRAHAM ...so how do I play him, Sidney? 
DR. BLOOM Compliment him. Tell him most people don't have the intellectual capacity to understand what has happened, that sort of thing. (beat) If he's paranoid, play into his grievance. Let him air it. (beat) If he's picked you as an adversary and wants to gloat, give him what he's after. A little at a time. 
CRAWFORD ... very little. If it's all electronic switching we'll need a minute for the trace. 
Graham turns to the window. Crawford taps a pencil on his desk. They wait, 
CUT TO: 
SAME - LATER - NIGHT 
Crawford's feet are on his desk. Sarah yawns. Graham leans against the other wall. Stony silence. RING. They react. FOUR more RINGS. 
SARAH (into phone) Special Agent Crawford's office. (beat) Bill, call back on twenty-four four. We need to keep this line clear... 
She hangs up. Crawford takes Bill's call on the other line. The rest exhale tension and go back to waiting. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MEN'S ROOM - FAUCET - NIGHT Runs water. 
GRAHAM. 
stares at it. He puts his hands under and runs cold water on his upturned wrists. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CBAWFORD'S OFFICE - CRAWFORD - NIGHT Looking through reports. He picks up a pencil and starts to correct a line when:  RING. 
CRAWFORD Where the hell's Graham! 
RING . 
SARAH He went to the men's room. 
RING . 
CRAWFORD For Christ's sake get him! 
An assistant runs out. RING. Sarah's anxious. CUT TO: 
EXT. CORRIDOR - GRAHAM - NIGHT 
Running. He slips on the polished floor, recovers himself ... He darts through Crawford's door. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CXAWFORD'S OFFICE - GRAHAM 
tries to catch his breath as Sarah snaps up the phone. 
SARAH Special Agent Crawford's office. (she nods; it's him) Could you hold on a second, I'll see if I can find him. 
Sarah punches hold. Crawford is counting seconds. He raises his thumb. Graham grabs the phone. 
GRAHAM (calm) This is Will Graham. Can I help you? 
Dr. Chilton reacts. 
DR. CHILTON (fast) Do you have it? 
GUARD Yeah. It's right here. 
Guard pulls three sheers of toiler paper with writing on them out of his pocket. We HOLD ON it. 
DR. CHILTON 
is already dialling a number. 
DR. CHILTON Put it down on my desk blotter and don't touch it again. Has anyone else handled it except you? 
GUARD No. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAWFORD'S OFFICE - NIGHT Sarah answers the phone. 
SARAH Special Agent Crawford's office. 
In the b.g. all hell is breaking loose. Crawford and Graham are both hollering into the phone at Freddie Lounds. 
SARAH Speak up, please. I can hardly hear you! 
DR. CBILTON (V.O.) (shouting) I said I need to speak to Special Agent Crawford or Mr. Graham. Right away! 
SARAH (holding one ear closed) I'm sorry. Special Agent Crawford and Graham are tied up tight now. Can I get them to call you back? 
DR. CHILTON (V.O.) (going nuts) This is Dr. Chilton. At the Chesapeake Hospital. Will you please call them this is very, very urgent!! 
(beat) I'll hold on. 
Sarah puts Chilton on "Hold." TRACK her INTO the room. She starts to say something. Crawford holds up a hand... 
CRAWFORD (hollering) How'd you know 'broken mirrors?' Bribe a cop? (beat) Tell it to the U.S. Attorney, Lounds! 
GRAHAM (seeing Sarah) What is it? 
SARAH It's a Dr. Chilton, sir. He says it's urgent. 
Graham punches the phone and takes the call. Crawford's yelling at Lounds. 
GRARAM It's Will Graham... 
DR. CHILTON (V.O.) Well, it's about goddamn time! I have a note here, or two pieces of a note, that appears to be from the man who killed those people in Atlanta and.... 
GRAHAM Where did you get it?! 
Graham waves Crawford to the other phone. 
DR. CHILTON (V.O.) From Hannibal Lecktor's cell. It was hidden in a book. 
CRAWFORD (to Lounds) Run along to the police station, Freddie. We'll talk to you when we get around to it... 
Crawford punches into Dr. Chilton's call. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHESAPEAKE HOSPITAL - DR. CHIITON - NIGHT 
GRAHAM (V.O.) Can you read it to me? 
DR. CHILTON It's written on toilet tissue. (reads ) 'My dear Dr. Lecktor, I wanted to tell you I'm delighted that you've taken an interest in me. I know that you alone can understand what I'm becoming. (reads ) 'I know you alone understand the reality of the people who die to help me in these things, understand that they are only elements undergoing change to fuel the radiance of what I am becoming. Just as the source of light is burning. (beat) Mr. Graham, there's a hole torn and punched our, then it says... (reads) 'I have a complete collection of your press notices. f think of them as unfair. As unfair as mine. The "Tooth Fairy." What could be more inappropriate. Investigator Graham interests me. Very purposeful locking. I hope we can correspond. (beat) There's another piece missing here. I'LL read the bottom part. (reads ) 'After I hear back from you, I might send you something wet. Signed: Avid Fan. (to Graham) It has teethmarks pressed in it at the bottom. 
CRAWFORD 
punches the other line. 
CBAWFORD Sarah, order a chopper. I want the next thing smoking and I don't care whose. Ours. DCPD.  Or the Marines. Then call Documents. Tell them to scramble a team. I want everybody moving in five minutes. (punches into Dr. Chilton's line) Dr. Chilton, please do not handle the note. I have a Documents team on the way to you by helicopter to pick it up. 
GRAHAM After we've worked the note we want to replace it in Lecktor's cell. I don't want him to know we found it. (beat) Where's Lector now? 
DR. CHILTON (V.O.) In a holding cell. 
GRAHAM How long can you keep Lecktor out without him getting suspicious? 
DR. CHILTON (V.O.) Three, four hours. 
CRAWFORD Have your building superintendent shut off the water and most of the lighting in Lecktor's hall. Have him walk through carrying tools and being pissed off or something, 
DR. CHILTDN (V.O.) Yes. We can manage all that. 
CRAWFORD (hits another line) Brian. We have a note coming in on the fly. Possibly from the Tooth Fairy. Number one priority., It has to go to Hair and Fiber, Latent Prints and Documents. Graham and I will be walking it through... 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI BUILDING, HAIR AND FIBER SECTION - BEVERLY KATZ - NIGHT 
is bent over a microscope. She's under it. Behind her a male assistant brushes a child's bib overalls with a metal spatula. He is collecting whatever debris comes off the clothing onto a white paper sheet. BEVERLY KATZ lifts something with tweezers. She leans away from the micro- scope . 
BEVERLY KATZ One hair, Graham. Maybe a thirty- second of an inch. A couple of blue grains. I'll work it up. What else have you got? 
GRAHAM Hair from Lecktor's comb. Whiskers from an electric razor they let him use. This is hair from the cleaning man. 
BOWMAN When do they go to press? 
GRAHAM In thirty-five minutes. 
BOWMAN Christ! 
CRAWFORD After we find Lecktor's response, we substitute our own. Somewhere tomorrow night the Tooth Fairy will actually buy Tattler, looking for Lecktor's message. Here's what he'll find, Bill. 
BILL (reads ) 'Dear Avid Fan: inherit my mantle and surpass my achievements. Mementoes for you at Baltimore Central. Left luggage 72683. 
CRAWFORD It's a Secret Service letter drop and stakeout. He shows: we take him. (beat) Anything from Chicago? 
SARAH Not yet. 
CRAWFORD Let's get to the physical. 
PRICE There was no print. I'm here for kicks . 
BEVERLY KATZ One whisker. Scale counts and core size match Hannibal Lecktor's. So does color. The color's different than the Tooth Fairy's taken in Birmingham and Atlanta. Three blue grains and some dark flecks went to Brian's end. 
BRIAN ZELLAR The grains are commercial granulated cleanser with chlorine. Must be from the cleaning man. There are several particles of dried blood. Not enough to type. 
GRAHAM Bowman? 
BOWMAN It's Snow White toilet paper. National distribution. 
Bowman sets up his photographs on an easel. 
BOWMAN (beat) If there's any doubt, we matched the indents of the bitemark on the note against the Smithsonian teeth. This is your boy... (beat) He folded the bottom part, including what Lecktor tore out. In this enlargement of the back side, oblique light revealed impressions. We can make out: 'six-six-six'. (beat) I didn't spot it until I had this high-contrast print. I advised Chicago as soon as I saw it. 
CRAWFORD Issue the toilet paper tear as a... 
The phone RINGS. Graham punches the speaker. 
CHESTER (V.O.) This is Chester here. Who am I talking to? 
GRAHAM Will Graham, Jack Crawford... 
CHESTER (V.O.) We got an ad order in tonight's "Tattler" with 'six-six-six' in it. It's being Telexed to you right now. 
GRAHAM Read it. 
CHESTER (V.O.) (reads) 'Dear Pilgrim, you honor me.' 
GRAHAM That's it. Lecktor called him a Pilgrim when he was talking to me... 
CHESTER (V.O.) 'You're very beautiful. 
CBAWFORD Christ... 
CHESTER (V.O.) 'I offer one hundred prayers for your safety. Find help in john 6:22, 8:16 9:1;Luke l:7, 3:1; Galatians 6:11. 15:2; Acts 3:3; Revelations 18:i; Jonah 6:8... (beat) It's signed: 'Bless you, 6:6:6' 
Bowman is already running through the onion-skinned pages of a Bible he took from a shelf. Nobody talks to him. 
CRAWFORD (checks watch) ... twenty-eight minutes. (low to Sarah) Cryptography at Langley? 
SARAH They got shot a Telex. They're on if now... 
Everybody exhibits disciplined surface calm. The tension is screaming underneath. 
BOWMAN 
furiously looking through pages of the Bible, suddenly stops. 
BOWMAN (to Graham) No. (beat) The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code. (beat) And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him. 
CRAWFORD Book code? 
BOWMAN 'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book? 
CBAWFORD Not the Bible? 
BOWMAN No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible. 
GRAHAM Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out. 
BOWMAN Right . (beat) What about sweating Lecktor? 
GRAHAM They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. (beat) He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip. 
BOWMAN it has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell. 
GRAHAM He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor... 
CRAWFORD Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place... 
BOWMAN Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books... 
CRAWFORD Where? 
BOWMAN Library of Congress. 
Bowman's our the door. 
GRAHAM Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time. 
He catches Molly's eye: 
MOLLY'S POV: KITCHEN WINDOW 
A silhouette shape moves past the window. The angle of the streetlight plays its shadow on the wall against Molly. 
FRONTAL CLOSEUP: MOLLY 
frozen. She hears the outer screen door being opened... 
BEHIND MOLLY & OVER HER SHOULDER TO KITCHEN DOOR 
The shape is at the door. Molly takes a couple of steps, and can't go any further. 
MOLLY 
breathless, opens the door. Fast. 
DOOR 
reveals Florida State TROOPER. 
TROOPER Are you all right, ma'am? 
MOLLY (fast breathing) Yes. Why? (beat) What's going on 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GRAHAM HOUSE - TROOPER + MOLLY - NIGHT 
As Molly comes out of the house, we PULL BACK and CRANE UP INTO a very HIGH ANGLE WIDE SHOT revealing: Four state trooper cars parked on Graham's property. On the road are two roadblocks 100 yards apart on either side of Graham's house. All their flashers are going. Molly looks around in confusion. We see her turn to the sea, a coast guard launch pulls to 100 yards off the beach. Its searchlight plays on the water's edge then across the property. Molly look; at all the policemen... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AIRPORT - GULF STREAM JET - DAY 
advances on us, its engine screaming. Its front wheel brakes to a stop right before CAMERA. 
DOOR 
opens. Running down the stairs and across the tarmac is Will Graham in shirtsleeves with a Car-15 assault rifle with collapsible stock. His eyes scan the perimeter. 
FBI MEN 
moving fast, follow Graham. Their eyes sweep the terminal area. One carries an Uzi submachine gun, the other two, handguns. 
A CORDON OF FLORIDA STATE TROOPERS 
hussle Molly and Kevin between them from their cars towards Graham. Two carry suitcases. 
GRAHAM + MOLLY + KEVIN 
inside the protective barrier of men. 
HIGH ANGLE: THE AIRPORT 
Graham moves Molly and Kevin up into the Gulf Stream. FBI men follow. The troopers back off. The flashers on their cars are still turning. PAN RIGHT with the Gulf Stream as it taxis to the head of the runway. It pauses a moment, then blasts down the runway and up into the morning sun. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BALTIMORE SAFE HOUSE, FOYER - DOOR - DAY 
HOLD. Then it opens. Molly and Kevin, followed by Graham. Unmarked FBI cars are parked on the front lawn. Molly enters the foyer, looks around and stops. 
HOUSE INTERIOR Holiday Inn decor. 
MOLLY Who decorated this place, Richard Nixon? 
Molly takes a deep breath. Then lets it out. She's tired. Graham takes her hand. 
GRAHAM ...sorry, Molly. I'm sorry this happened to you. 
MOLLY You didn't do it to me, Will; it's happened to us. (touches his face) And if I survive the wallpaper we'll be okay... (Graham has to smile) He's after you now, isn't he? 
She didn't check to see that Kevin is our of earshot. Graham does. 
GRAHAM It's a precaution... (to Kevin) Why don't you run down to the bay. They got a swimming float. 
KEVIN I'll hang around in here. I'll just be in the kitchen, Mom... 
GRAHAM (to Molly) What is he? Afraid to leave you alone with me now?' (beat) He read the Tattler piece, didn't he? 
MOLLY He didn't know you had been in a mental institution. Be asked me if I knew. I said yes. I wanted to talk to him. He said he wanted to bring it up to you. Face to face . 
GRAHAM Good for him. (beat) Thanks a lot, Freddie! (to Kevin) Kevin. We're going grocery shopping . 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUPERMARKET - GRAHAM + KEVIN - DAY 
push a basket collecting stuff from the shelves. Other families are shopping The place is medium-crowded. Mind- dulling MUZAK comes from the ceiling. 
KEVIN Is there anything I need to know to see about Mom? 
GRAHAM No. You're very well-protected. No one can find our where you are. 
MOLLY You remember when we first met? And were together alone in that room. And the exhilaration was too much to hold on to. And then something flickered across your face like a shadow and I asked you what was wrong? 
GRAHAM I remember. 
MOLLY Do you remember what you said? 
GRAHAM Yes. I said this is too good to live... 
Molly stares into his eyes. 
MOLLY Time is luck, Will. (heat ) I know the value of our days... 
They stare into each other. There's a pause. They rise. She puts her arm around Graham's waist. They start towards the house. 
MOLLY Let's go to bed. I'll rub your back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI CAFETERIA - CRAWFORD + BLOOM - DAY 
CRAWFORD I need to talk to you about Will Graham. 
BLOOM What about him? 
CRAWFORD I need to ask you questions of a psychological nature. 
BLOOM Remember when you asked for a study on him, I refused. Same goes for now. 
CRAWFORD That was Peterson upstairs. 
BLOOM It was you who did the asking. 
CRAWFORD He doesn't think you run mind games on him. 
BLOOM I wouldn't presume to try. 
CRAWFORD You're never alone in a room with Graham, are you? You're smooth about it, but you're never one-on- one with him. Why's that? Do you think he's psychic? 
BLOOM He's an eideteker. He has almost total recall.   But I don't think he's psychic.   What he has it empathy and projection  He can assume your point of view and mine.., and some other points of view that scare and sicken him. 
CRAWFORD Why aren't you ever alone with him? 
BLOOM Because I'm professionally concerned about him. And he'd pick up on that. He's fast. He hates being prodded and poked. (beat) So do I. (beat) What do you want? 
CRAWFORD His nervous breakdown followed Hobbs. Could he kill again if he had to save his life? Or would he hesitate? 
BLOOM I'll tell you the events. The psychology's none of your business. Hobbs was trying to cut his eleven- year-old daughter's throat. Graham shot him with his .38 six times. Hobbs still didn't go down. He had to wade in... 
CRAWFORD That's when it happened? 
BLOOM No. It happened when Graham went to see Hobbs' daughter four months later in the hospital. She saved her carotid artery.., but lost three fingers and her larynx. She was connected up to a voice box. When Graham went to see her, she asked him -- through the speaker: 'Why did you have to kill my daddy? ' (beat) That's when Graham had his nervous breakdown. 
CRAWFORD What's the bottom line? 
BLOOM If he pushes too deep into our boy's mind-set, he may destroy himself. (beat) What are you planning, Jack? 
CRAWFORD Could he handle a direct contact? 
BLOOM I don't recommend it. 
GRAHAM (O.S.) You don't recommend what, Sidney? 
Crawford is surprised at Graham's entry. Bloom isn't. 
BLOOM Crawford has a proposition. I don't think it's a good idea. 
GRAHAM If the Tooth Fairy listens to Lecktor, he'll come for me. So we're going to set me up as bait to draw him out. Give him a clean shot. (MORE) 
GRAHAM (CONT'D) (beat) That's what you were thinking, isn't it? 
Crawford's embarrassed. Bloom said Graham was fast. 
GXAHAM I'll use Lounds. 
Now Bloom's surprised... 
GRAHAM Sidney, he doesn't read the "Sunday Times literary supplement. He reads Lounds in the "Tattler." (beat) And I want this over with... Fast. 
CUT TO: 
INT. WASHINGTON APARTMENT - GRAHAM + LOUNDS - DAY Graham leans against a table, his back to a window. GRAHAM I believe he's socially maladjusted. Laughed at by his contemporaries... 
LOUNDS How does he rate compared to Dr, Hannibal Lecktor? 
GRAHAM He's not as intelligent. 
PULL BACK to reveal Bloom, Crawford, a photographer and assistant. Graham motions for Lounds to turn off his tape recorder. 
GRAHAM (to Bloom) What have we missed? 
BLOOM He may have an unconscious homosexual conflict. A fear of being gay. He objects to the word 'fairy.' Plus smeared bloodstains indicate that he put the shorts on Charles Leeds after he was dead. I believe he did this to emphasize his lack of interest in Mr, Leeds. 
Graham motions Lounds to turn the tape recorder on again. 
GRAHAM The killer has sexually molested all his male victims. He is a homosexual and impotent with persons of the opposite sex. (beat) Our forensic psychologists have projected he may have been the product of an incestuous home life . (added afterthought) And probably had sexual relations with his mother... 
He starts coming back. He rakes off his silver sunglasses revealing the white violet eyes. 
DOLLARHYDE You told me what?! 
CLOSE: NEWSSTAND OPERATOR

EXT. WASHINGTON APARTMENT, PARKING LOT - GRAHAM'S CAR - NIGHT 
pulls into the prescribed space. It's raining. He kills the engine and gets out.

exiting the car. The image is in GREEN AND BLACK. We are:

A SECOND HIGH ANGLE: GRAHAM also in GREEN AND BLACK. Reveal we are: 
EXT. SECOND ROOFTOP - SWAT #2 
with the same rifle sweeping the parking lot. He reacts to something to his left. 
GRAHAM 
... walking along the determined line, fifty yards from the apartment building.., hears something through the delicate patter of the rain. 
GRAHAM'S POV: CORNER OF BUILDING 
A distant "plop-plop-plop" of running feet... 
GRAHAM'S eyes tighten. 
CORNER OF BUILDING 
HOLD. Then entering around the corner is a running MAN. He's 6'2". He's heavy and wears a running suit with the hood up. His face is lost in its shadow. 
RUNNER'S RIGHT HAND 
is gloved and slips into the pocket of his jacket, grasping something... 
RUNNER'S FEET ACROSS WET BLACK TARMAC splash through shallow puddles. 
GRAHAM'S FACE 
in anticipation. The foot beats are getting LOUDER... 
GBAHAM'S EYES 
like taut wire about to snap. 
WIDE PROFILE:  GRAHAM on the left.   The Runner enters on the right. In SLOW MOTION as they cross, Graham slams him sideways... 
RUNNER 
is knocked off balance and slams face forward into the side of a car. He comes off the car violently, to turn, to fight ... 
.44 BULLDOG 
comes up.., pressure on the trigger. 
RUNNER'S HEAD 
turns INTO CAMERA. He is a black man with a moustache and scared eyes staring into the .44. His hands shoot into the air: 
RUNNER (MAN) Yo, boss. Plastic and cash in the right pocket...! 
GRAHAM (re the mistake) God-dammit!!! 
Walking away, Graham rips off his jacket: and the Kevlar vest. Coming off the expectation of contact, Graham is explosive. The Runner looks at Graham as if he's crazy: Spurgen and two D.C. cops are running in. 
RUNNER Arrest dat sucker...! 
Crawford catches up to Graham: 
CRAWFORD You okay? 
Graham shoulders past Crawford He throws the Kevlar vest across the parking lot. He almost killed the man. Meanwhile, Spurgen is with the Runner. 
SPURGEN It was a mistake . Sorry we... 
RUNNER 'Sorry' yo' mama!! 
Runner pissed off -- starts towards Graham. Spurgen stops him. 
SPURGEN Hold on! We thought you were someone we're trying to catch... 
RUNNER (backs up) Hold onto this!! (grabs his groin) I get dat cannon stuck up mah face?! Car dirt splattered up and down mah Calvin Kleins?! 
'Catch somebody?!' You couldn't catch yo' ass with yo' right hand! You lucky you muther-fuckers catch a cold! Who the hell goin' pay my cleanin' bill? Huh? 
turns away. The shape of Dollarhyde passes behind his head. The kimono is on again. 
PAST LOUNDS' HEAD: SCREEN 
A slide appears. It is Blake's painting. 
DOLLARHYDE Look at the screen. That is William Blake's 'The Great Red Dragon and The Woman Clothed with the Sun. Do you see? 
LOUNDS Yes ... 
Next picture: Mrs. Jacobi, eyes wide. 
DOLLARHME Do you see? 
LOUNDS Yes .

DOLLARHYDE Do you see? 
LOUNDS Yes.

DOLLARHYDE Do you see? 
LOUNDS Please, no. 
DOLLARHYDE 'No' what? 
LOUNDS Not me. 
DOLLARHYDE Are you a man? 
LOUNDS Yes. 
DOLLARHYDE Do you imply that I'm a queer? 
LOUNDS God, no. 
DOLLARHYI)E Are you queer, Mr. Lounds? 
LOUNDS No. 
REAR OF DOLLARHYDE'S HEAD 
Beyond him is the screen and the image of Freddie Lounds with Graham's arm over his shoulder. 
DOLLARHYDE Before me you are a slug in the sun. You are privy to a great becoming and you recognize nothing. You are an ant in the afterbirth. (beat) It is your nature to do only one thing correctly: tremble. Bur fear is not what you owe me. Lounds: you and the others, YOU OWE ME AWE! (long pause) We have one more piece of work to do. 
Dollarhyde leaves. Lounds closes his eyes. 
LOUNDS (to himself) Didn't take off the mask. Please, God, let him not take off the mask. If he comes back with it off, I'm dead... 
DOLLARHME'S HAND 
carries a tape recorder. We PAN it across the room to Lounds' face . DOLLARHYDE (O.S.) Open your eyes, Mr. Lounds. 
Lounds obeys. 
CLOSE: DOLLARHYDE 
The stocking mask and teeth -- stained and jagged -- are in place. 
DOLLARHYDE Now you will read this into the tape recorder. 
ON LOUNDS 
LOUNDS 'I have had a great privilege. I have seen with wonder the strength of the Red Dragon. All I wrote about him before was lies from Will Graham. He made me write them. Now I understand. (beat) 'Will Graham: you will learn from my own lips how much you have to dread. Because I was forced to lie, he will be more merciful to me than to you. (beat) 'I will be a testament to the truth, now. About his work. About his becoming.' 
DOLLARHYDE'S HAND turns off the tape recorder. 
DOLLARHYDE You did very well.   I apologize for the crude images.    Next time I'll have film stock that doesn't need lights . 
LOUNDS You'll let me go now? 
DOLLARHYDE You will tell the truth? 
He shakes his head and locks away from her, wondering about himself: 
GRAHAM Molly. (pause) I love you. And I'm not really going to be fit to be with for awhile... 
They are both frozen: in the same room but very separate. Molly's eyes are moist. She gets up and leaves. Graham sits at the kitchen table by himself, both hands around his mug of coffee. Slowly, deliberately, he picks up the mug to take a sip. Then he sits alone in the kitchen. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BALTIMORE AIRPORT - GRAHAM - DAY On a pay phone to Dr. Bloom. 
GBAHAM Sidney: I don't understand him. We know he re-arranges the kids and husbands into a dead audience. To witness the act. We know he thinks the act is making him into something different. His 'becoming' ...but I don't know what it is he thinks he's becoming. (beat) The answer is something to do with how he uses the mirrors. That's what's missing for me. why the mirrors? 
BLOOM (V.O.) The usual motivation doesn't apply to him, nor the way he uses them. I don't have an answer for you. (beat) Listen to me, my friend: leave this. 
GRAHAM And do what? Read about the next family in the morning paper? In my Monkey Ward safehouse 'cause I can't take my family home? (beat) This ends when I make it over. 
BLOOM (V.O.) How are Molly and the boy?

Graham's hand enters and flattens against his half-reflection on the cool glass. He hears: 
VALERIE LEEDS (V.O.) (ansaphone recording ) 'Hello. This is Valerie Leeds. I'm sorry I can't come to the phone right now ... 
GRAHAM I'm sorry, too... 
WAITRESS Excuse me...? 
Graham turns. The WAITRESS looks at him strangely. 
GRAHAM Coffee ...

GRAHAM It's just YOU and me now, sport. And I'd better hurry up and find you. (beat) Because I'm losing all this... 
CUT TD: 
INT. DARKROOM - DOLLABHYDE - NIGHT 
Entering. It is almost totally dark. In the green dullness we make our the forms of a WOMAN and Dollarhyde. 
DOLLARHYDE Ms. McClain, I'm Francis Dollarhyde. I came about the low light level infrared film stock. 
REBA (WOMAN) Put your back against the doer. Come forward three steps until you feel the tile an your feet and there will be a stool just to your left. 
We see Dollarhyde's form follow instructions and sit. 
REBA Can you give me an idea of the conditions... 
DOLLARHYDE Shooting at maybe eight feet. I can't use any lights. 
REBA What's being photographed? 
DOLLARHYDE The activities of nocturnal animals. 
REBA When do you need it? 
DOLLARHYDE In eight days. 
REBA Let me stick this in the black hole. 
We see some movements. Then the light comes on. 
DOLLARHYDE'S 
hand is curled under his nose, hiding his Z-plast scars. Then he reacts to something. His face lights up in an uncharacteristically open smile. 
He brazenly looks the woman up and down. We don't understand why he can do this. 
REBA McCLAIN 
is blind. Her white cane is propped in the corner. She's thirty with a handsome prairie face. 
REBA The 1000 C Infrared Sensitive Film must be handled in total darkness. I keep the samples straight by touch code . (beat) It's still easier to handle than a 1200 series. Think it'll do? 
DOLLARHYDE It'll do fine. 
RALPH DANDRIDGE, 
young manager of the department enters, checks watch. 
DANDRIDGE Reba, dear, I've got to fly. (beat) Mr. Dollarhyde, if it wouldn't be too much trouble could you help her home ? 
REBA I can 'help' myself home, Ralph... 
sits among piles of Leeds family possessions. He opens a child's toy. It's large, pink plastic and heart-shaped. It's a Mexican fantasy house with puffy white plastic clouds, strange handles and doors with eyes in them, 
REARSHOT: GRAHAM 
half and half out of a shaft of yellow light that radiates motes of dust in the air. Graham merely sits and stares into all of the debris of this dead family. PULL BACK to see the vast expanse of the room which is a total disarray of all the furniture, all the possessions and papers, all the bits and pieces of matter, that are accumulated in a life by two adults and three children. Everything from washing machines to tricycles to sleds. They litter the vast floor space. While we WIDEN, we hear: 
VOICE :1(O.S.) What's he doin'? Been in there all day . 
VOICE :2 (O.S.) Just sits and stares at the stuff... 
The CAMERA now includes two UNIFORMED SECURITY GUARDS at the door. They watch Graham, As we WIDEN and PULL BACK they fall into REAR SHOT. HOLD.

INT. WHITE CORRIDOR - REBA ON DOLLARHYDE'S ARM - NIGHT 
Her cane taps the white tile floor. It's antiseptic and sinister. We worry about where he's taking her. 
REBA Ready to tell me what kind of 'outing' this is? 
DOLLARHYDE It's a surprise. 
Her head arcs back as she senses: 
REBA Francis? We're at the zoo...! 
CUT TO: 
INT. ZOO EXAMINATIONTION ROOM - DR. WARFIELD - NIGHT 
DR. WARFIELD In two days we're going to cap his tooth. Can you smell him? 
REBA (aglow) Yes! 
DR. WARFIELD Are you apprehensive? Your protective and muscular gentleman over there is watching us like a cat. 
REBA No, no! I want to. 
Dollarhyde reacts with a light smile at the compliment. 
DR. WARFIELD All right, put your left hand on the edge of the table and you can explore with your right. I'll be right here beside you. 
We see Reba start to reach out. Then we see what she is about to touch. 
TEN-FOOT LONG BENGAL TIGER 
Reba's hand feels the fur slide across her palm. 
REBA'S HAND 
The fur springs between her fingers. 
TIGER'S GREAT PAW Reba's hand enters down its foreleg. Warfield -- with two hands -- lifts the great paw and puts it in her hand. Reba's hand feels the roughness of the pads. She presses and the claw slides cut. Both her hands go up his leg to the heavy supple muscles of his shoulder. 
TIGER'S HEAD 
Reba's hand gently touches the tiger's ears and both hands feel the width of his head. 
TIGER'S MOUTH 
The hot breath coming across its rough tongue stirs the hairs on her forearms. 
TIGER'S CHEST 
Reba's arms wrap around the huge chest. Slowly her face lowers and she puts her ear next to the tiger's ribs. Reba's ecstatic. We hear what she hears: the HEARTBEAT. It fills us and Reba with its bright thunder. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DOLLARHYDE'S HOUSE - THE GREAT RED DRAGON ARD THE WOMAN CLOTHED WITH THE SUN - NIGHT

CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM - FAUCET + HANDS 
Hands are Reba's. We FOLLOW them up to the wall as they search for and find a towel. O.S. we hear the hum of a film PROJECTOR starring. We see the sightless Reba reflected in the mirror. Feeling her way, she starts out... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LIVING BOOM - PAN 
It's dark brown with wing-armed 50's-futuristic furniture. A Sryrosphere casts scars and constellations throughout the room. A full-sized mural from JPL of the Mars surface is on one wall. 
We MOVE-PAST objects: a recliner lounger, two film projectors, a black and white fifties clock with golf bails in the arrow arms, a Magnavox console TV set and a sofa with Dollarhyde and Reba on it. They're watching a movie. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
CLOSER: DOLLARHYDE AND REBA 
The film projector hums. We don't see what movie Dollarhyde is watching. 
REBA 
(beat) That was nice of you to think of that. 
REBA My sister's coming by to pick me up for brunch. Why don't you come, too? 
DOLLARHYDE I have work to do at the plant. 
REBA I'll get my purse. 
DOLLARHYDE I'll get it. (leaving) Stay right here. You lock very good in the sun... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SERVICE STATION - ATTENDANT - DAY 
He's heavy-set and sullen. Dollarhyde's van, with Reba, pulls in. 
DOLLARHYDE Do you want a Coke or something, Reba? 
REBA I'm fine, Francis. 
Dollarhyde gets out. 
DOLLARHYDE Fill it up and check the oil, please. 
Dollarhyde crosses to the men's room. After placing the nozzle in the gas tank the ATTENDANT bangs open the hood, draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10-40, jams the oil spout into the can and sticks the spout into the engine. As he starts to move around the van he sees something in the interior and stops. A smile dawns on his face. We don't know what he sees. He starts wiping the windshield. He wipes and wipes the same spot. 
REBA'S 
dress is just above her knees. She sits on the high seat. Her legs are crossed. Her white cane lays between the seats. From his lower angle at the van window the Attendant can look up her dress. He bends down a little to see better... 
MEN'S ROOM DOOR 
Nothing. Then Dollarhyde ENTERS. He crumples a paper rowel and throws it in the basket. Dollarhyde crosses around the backside of the van. 
DRIVER'S WINDOW 
Dollarhyde appears. As he starts to reach for his wallet on the dash, he sees what the Attendant's doing... 
ATTENDANT 
unaware of Dollarhyde -- is grinning and still wiping the same spot in front of Reba. 
DOLLARHYDE 
is coming around the van. Fast. 
DOLLARHYDE You sonofabitch... 
ATTENDANT (cocky) You don't like it? You know what you can do about it... 
Attendant starts away. Dollarhyde catches him and shoves him into and through a display of STP. The Attendant bounces once and slams into the station wall. CANS CRASH and roll away... Dollarhyde does know what he can do about it. 
REBA'S FACE 
through the windshield. She's trying to find the handle to roll down the window. 
ATTENDANT 
is white. There is something in Dollarhyde's face that he has never seen before, anywhere. 
DOLLARHYDE 
pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. He advances on the frozen Attendant. He looks at the sharp end of the spout. 
ATTENDANT 
is wide-eyed. Dollarhyde's big hand ENTERS and flattens the man into the wall, compressing his thorax. 
DOLLARHYDE I ought to jam this in your chest, and drain your heart... 
The Attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk. Dollarhyde's hand has grabbed his face. He hesitates. Then he throws money at the Attendant and leaves... 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - GRAHAM - NIGHT With Crawford on the phone. 
CRAWFORD (V.O.) You got the message Lecktor called... 
GRAHAM I arranged for him to have a phone. I have to call him in a few minutes. 
CRAWFORD (V.O.) From the lip wound, which happened seven hours before he got burned, we've narrowed it down to those cities within the seven-hour driving radius that also would've caught the 'Tattler' early Tuesday morning. 
GRAHAM What's it narrow down to? 
CRAWFORD(V.O.) Milwaukee, Madison, Dubuque, Peoria, Sr. Louis, Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Toledo and Detroit. 
GRAHAM (laughs ) That's narrow? 
CRAWFORD (V.O.) When are you coming back? 
GRAHAM When I'm done. 
Graham hangs up the phone. He looks out the window at the rain. He dials again. 
GRAHAM It's Will Graham. Is Molly there, Mr. Swenson? 
GRAMPA (V.0.) Well, how you doin', Mr. Graham?! You sure are in the center of a storm. Burning up lots of taxpayer's dollars, too, I bet. (beat) On the news they said he was a white man. He isn't really, is he? 
RED DRAGON (O.S.) THEY WILL FIND OUT ABOUT YOU. THEY WILL LOCK YOU IN A PLACE WORSE THAN BROTHER BUDDY'S. 
DOLLARHYDE No. 
RED DRAGON (O.S.) 
THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A PIECE OF SHIT AGAIN. THEY'LL MAKE YOU BE A HARELIP AGAIN. YOU BETTER GIVE ME WHAT I WANT! 
DOLLARHYDE No! 
By now we're close to his body curled up on the floor in the sanctuary of the developing room. The red glow emanates from beneath Dollarhyde's shirt. 
RED DRAGON (O.S.) SHE'LL FUCK OTHER PEOPLE. PRETTY PEOPLE. SHE'LL PUT IN HER MOUTH THEIR... 
DOLLARHYDE. Shut up. Stop. Stop it. 
He stands. 
RED DRAGON (O.S.) YOU GIVE ME HER AND THE SHERMANS! YOU BETTER GIVE ME BOTH! 
DOLLARHYDE I want her! I want her alive... I'm going to keep her! YOU HEAR ME!!! 
He starts throwing bottles of chemicals across the room. They form a moire pattern of colors on walls. Some splash on him and make his shirt smoke. 
PHONE 
Dollarhyde's unsteady hand takes it off the wall. Be pours sweat. If the acid that makes his shirt smoke burns him, he doesn't acknowledge it. He punches four numbers. 
DOLLARHYDE Reba ... 
REBA (V.O.) Francis? Where are you? 
DOLLARHYDE The developing room. (beat) I need to... see you. 
REBA (V.O.) I want to see you, too, Francis... Should I come over? 
DOLLARHYDE (into phone) No. Reba...? 
REBA (V.O.) (phone filter) Are you okay...? 
DOLLARHYDE (into phone; getting control) I'll see you later. All right? 
REBA (V.O.) (phone filter) You'll come by? 
DOLLARHYDE (into phone) Yes . 
CUT TO: 
EXT. REBA'S HOUSE - SLOW TRACK PAST DOLLARHYDE'S VAN - NIGHT 
He sits under the tree with the lights out. He is waiting. Watching. He looks at his watch. Then he hears a car approach and looks up. 
DOLLARHYDE'S POV: GREEN OLDSMOBILE pulls into Reba's drive. 
INT. VAN - DOLLARHME'S FACE 
Excited. He starts to get out. Now he stops. 
DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + RALPH DANDRIDGE 
exit the Oldsmobile. He helps Reba out of the car. She makes her own way up the sidewalk to her door. Reba opens her door with a key. She turns towards Dandridge. 
DANDRIDGE There's something on your face. 
He brushes at a speck of dust on Reba's cheek. 
INT. VAN - DOLLARHYDE stares. Events are threatening Dollarhyde's fragile stabil- ity. We don't want this to be happening, we don't want Dandridge to touch her... 
DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + DANDRIDGE 
We see what Dollarhyde imagines: Dandridge's fingers caress the soft skin of Reba's face. Reba's expression and mouth are open and warm to him. 
INT. VAN - DOLLARHYDE'S FACE Blank . 
DOLLARHYDE'S POV: REBA + DOLLARHYDE 
Reba smiles. Her lips part. His finger brushes between her lips... His hand goes to her breast... 
INT. DOLLARHYDE'S VAN - DOLLARHYDE'S hand clutches the dash. 
PADDED DASH 
His fingers pop through the vinyl, gouging deep furrows. We hear hyperventilating. 
EXT. REBA'S HOUSE - REBA + DANDRIDGE 
Normal reality. There was no, there is no seduction. No contact. 
REBA What was it? 
DANDRIDGE Pollen . 
REBA Thanks for the ride. 
DANDRIDGE See you tomorrow. 
GRAHAM He used a boltcutter to trim the branch out of his way. When he was watching from the woods. Why didn't he use it to go through the basement door? 
CRAWFORD Because a steel door and deadbolt were there when they were killed. 
GRAHAM You mean Jacobi put it in between when this film was made and when he was murdered? 
CRAWFORD He had to. 
Graham rifles through the files and comes up with the autopsy report on Donald Jacobi. 
GRAHAM Donald Jacobi's eleventh birthday party was April fourteenth. Sometime between April fourteenth and May third they changed the door. (beat) But you can't see either family's door from the street. He wouldn't know until he got to the house that the padlock wasn't there anymore... 
He freezes the Jacobi tape and loads and plays the Leeds tape : 
GRAHAM (intently on the screen ) From the alley he couldn't have seen the glass in the Leeds' kitchen door . (MORE) 
GRAHAM (CONT'D) There's a lattice porch back there, but he was ready with his glasscutter. (beat) So he was either casing far ahead and we didn't check back far enough or... 
MONITOR: LEEDS TAPE 
The Leeds' gray Scottie perks up his ears and runs in the glass kitchen door. The camera pans off the dog to Valerie Leeds coming in the door: behind her the door is vulnerable with its big glass pane. Her kids follow her through the door... 
CRAWFORD It's getting late and... 
GRAHAM (explodes) Don't talk to me!! 
Crawford's surprised. 
EXTREMELY CLOSE: GRAHAM 
Watching. Then he grabs the phone and punches numbers. 
GRAHAM It's Graham. The Jacobi stuff is still in the storeroom? 
METCALPE (V.O.) Yeah. You know what time it is? 
GRAHAM Have one of the guards down there call me. 
METCALFE (V.O.) If the guy's not asleep... 
GRAHAM Do it. 
He hangs up on Metcalfe. 
VTR MONITORS 
Graham's hand freezes the Leeds' rape and plays the Jacobi tape. The Jacobis' cat moves, jumps on the table. 
GRAHAM (to himself) You knew that was the Jacobis' cat ... 
The Jacobi boy pushes the bicycle out of the basement door with the padlock. 
GRAHAM (to himself) You brought a boltcutter... 'cause you thought there was a padlock... 
Next Mrs. 3acobi -- warm, smiling -- watches Donald ride the bike. Now Graham plays the Leeds' tape, too. The dog runs to camera... 
GRAHAM (to himself) And the Leeds' dog doesn't have a collar... But you know it's the Leeds' dog, don't you, my man?! 
His tail wagging, his tongue out; he's a friendly dog. Mrs. Leeds enters and pets him. 
GRAHAM (to himself) See the woman? 
Crawford is staring at Graham strangely. This is why Crawford drafted him. But Crawford doesn't look like he wants to be alone in the same room with Graham anymore... 
GRAHAM The bloom on the woman. You can almost feel her.  You can see her again and again. Anytime you want. (beat) The doggy doesn't have a collar. But you know the Leeds' dog, don't you? (beat) And you know the Jacobi cat. And the padlock on the door and you know you need a boltcutter and every other goddamn thing 'cause... (shouts) YOU'VE SEEN THESE FUCKING FILMS! (beat) Haven't you, my man? 
The PHONE RINGS. Crawford answers. His attention is riveted on Graham. 
CRAWFORD It's the guard in the storeroom. 
GRAHAM (to Crawford) We want the cans the Jacobi home movies came in. (beat) They're in the far corner of the room under the windows. 
CRAWFORD (into phone) There's some film cans in the far corner of the room underneath one of the windows. 
Crawford is very quiet. 
CRAWFORD He found them... 
Graham pushes aside the videotape sleeve and picks up the Leeds' home-movie can. 
GRAHAM (reads label) What it's going to say on the Jacobi film can is the same as it says on the Leeds' film can: Gateway Lab, St. Louis, Missouri. 
CRAWFORD (into phone) Is there a label on the Jacobi can that says what lab processed it? 
Crawford hears. Then he deflates. 
CRAWFORD (to Graham) No. It's Bob's Photo Store in... 
GRAHAM Have him peel the top label back. 
CRAWPORD (into phone) See if there's another label underneath. 
Crawford hears, Graham's watching him. 
GRAHAM It does, doesn't it? 
displays the license with picture and driving record of Dillon, Lincoln. He's a black man. 
LT, FISK (into phone; to Graham) No. 36 years old. Black... 
CUT TO: 
INT. GULF STREAM FLIGHT DECK - OVER PILOT'S SHOULDERS: -NIGHT 
St. Louis approaches. The flashing strobes of the airport runway indicator, the cobalt blue runway lights. 
PILOT (into PA) Could you fasten your seat belts. We're on our final approach... 
CUT TO: 
INT. GULF STREAM CABIN - GRAHAM + CRAWFORD - NIGHT 
Crawford buckles up. Graham is hearing. 
LT. PISK (V.O.) ...six foot, male caucasian, blond, violet eves 217 pounds, 38 years old... 
GRAHAM (into phone) Put it through the datafax. Fast. 
DATAFAX 
starts printing our line by line: a blow-up of a driver's license with picture. The lines compose hair, forehead, eyes... coming at us line by line is: Francis Dollarhyde. 
GRAHAM (into phone to Lt. Fisk) Route three, Chester, Missouri. Where is that? 
LT. FZSK (V.O.) From the airport you're closer. We'll meet at the Hock Road off ramp, Highway 94. 
CRAWFORD (to Graham) Fogel has four more names. He knows two: both dark hair. Third's a woman. Fourth's a handicapped parking permit... 
GRAHAM (re Dollarhyde) This is our boy...! 
CUT TO: 
INT. ST. LOUIS AIRPORT - GULF STREAM - NIGHT 
Hits the runway. Tires smoke. Its ENGINES SCREAM in reverse thrust. It taxis away from the terminal to a security area. Two St. Louis PD squad cars are waiting. 
GULF STREAM DOOR 
opens. Graham's out followed by Crawford. They run across the tarmac to the squad cars. Squad cars race out of the airport. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DOLLARHYDE'S KITCHEN - PANNING - NIGHT 
through shadows and highlights in the moonlight. we pass the sink and countertop and refrigerator and blue-enamelled broom closet. On the other side of it is Reba. She Is breathing heavily. 
She stands there, squeezing into the corner, trying to make herself disappear. Then she senses and freezes as a rabbit who is hunted and at a certain point, freezes... 
DOLLARHYDE 
stands four feet from her, just staring. Then he walks from the room. 
INT. DOLLARHYDE'S LIVING ROOM - DOLLARHYDE 
puts "INNAGADDADAVIDA" by Iron Butterfly from 1967 on the stereo. It BLASTS through the house. He is expressionless. Deep in his psychotic episode, his affect is flattened. 
INT. DOLLARHYDE BATHROOM - DOLLARHYDE 
as a reflection in the medicine cabinet - enters. His fist smashes. His image SHATTERS with the mirrored glass. 
DOLLARHYDE'S 
forearm destroys the glass shower door. He rips the metal frame from the walls. He snaps the mitred framework. The aluminum frame members have sharp 45 degree points. He takes them and the shards of mirror and leaves for the kitchen... Throughout his face has been expressionless. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MISSOURI STATE HIGHWAY 94 - TWO CAR CARAVAN - NIGHT 
streaks TOWARDS US down the almost deserted highway. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - GRAHAM - NIGHT 
in the back seat. He is distant. His attitude contrasts to the frantic 110 mph race down the highway and the two uniformed officers and Crawford. Their anxiety is visible. Next to them Graham seems zoned-our... 
OFFICER Meet point's up ahead! 
GRAHAM Go on to the house. 
OFFICER Lt. Fisk said... 
GRAHAM Go on to the house... 
He obeys Graham and floors it. Graham puts his black plastic briefcase on his lap and extracts the .44 Charter Arms Bulldog. He starts to load 6 matte-black, blunt-nosed Glaser Safety Slugs. He fumbles them in the swaying car. The bullets fall to the floor. 
CAR FLOOR 
Glaser Safety Slugs roll on the rubber matting. Graham's fingers enter and pick them up. We FOLLOW the rounds as they slip into the cylinder. 
CRAWFORD is staring at Graham's blankness.

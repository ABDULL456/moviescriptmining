NOTE:  THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS SOFT COPY. 
Wilson's first impression of Los Angeles was blue.  He was in the sky at the time, so it was a curious reversal, looking down rather than up at the color he had always felt was nature's finest. 
Swimming pools.  Hundreds of them.  Pockmarking the landscape like miniature lakes.  A flat landscape of straight streets and square blocks and sparse grass that didn't look quite green enough. 
As far as Wilson could remember, he had only ever seen seven or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been public ones.  Here everyone had their own.  Marvellous. 
There was the one at the Butlin's holiday camp where he had enjoyed his last legitimate employment -- as driver of a tour bus.  And there was the one at Crystal Palace he had gone to once or twice when he was younger.  He was most familiar, though, with the Chelsea Baths as he had lived for some time in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years -- before he'd gone grey, went to prison, and found himself in a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of his daughter. 
WHOOSH!  The sound of automatic doors opening and -- 
EXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL.  L.A. AIRPORT.  AFTERNOON. 
WILSON steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the day.  A slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized.  He wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before. After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior.  Or seen cops wearing guns on their belts.  Or black cops, for that matter, with guns on their belts.  Or seen people as fat as Americans on their home turf.  Things someone from England notices immediately, whether consciously at first or not. 
CUT. 
EXT. MOTEL.  EVENING. 
Wilson's not here for comfort.  Shown to a shitty room, round the corner of a typical 2nd-level outside walkway.  Airport close by. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM.  EVENING. 
He draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy glide.  His moves are neat.  His expressions just as economical, not giving much away.  Outside the planes are practically on top of us. The sunset colors strange and chemical. 
He's only got one light bag.  Unzips, unpacks a few things. Change of clothes, a travel kit, and some familiar items (shaving foam/toothpaste/deodorant} bearing unfamiliar British brand names. 
Goes into the bathroom.  Turns on the shower in there. 
Comes back to sit on the bed.  Takes an envelope out of his jacket. 
ENVELOPE 
Turns it over to see the return address on the back. 
CUT. 
INT. TAXI.  NIGHT. 
Wilson in the back.  Stares at the impenetrable name on the driver's posted ID. Glances at the driver. 
DRIVER glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview mirror. 
CUT. 
EXT. SMALL HOUSE.  NIGHT. 
Wilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door. Lower middle-class street.  Two cars in the driveway, one behind the other.  Lights on inside the house -- as he rings the bell. 
ED RAMA 
Answers it.  Hispanic.  Late 30's.  Chairman Mao on his T- shirt notwithstanding, an easygoing sort of fellow.  Not looking for any trouble -- anymore.  But once did, and able to handle himself if any shows up.  Which it has. 
WILSON Edward Rama? 
ED Eduardo. (rolling the R) Rama. 
WILSON You're home, then. 
He turns, waves away the taxi he's kept waiting.  While Eduardo Rama waits for an introduction. 
WILSON My name's Wilson. 
Accent speaks for itself.  Hard, working-class. 
ED Wilson? 
Knows the name.  But just now it's unexpected.  He's holding a hot TV dinner, hand protected by a dish towel. 
WILSON You wrote to me about my daughter. 
CUT. 
ED (looks away) Boomerang. 
WILSON Y'what? 
ED I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face. (looks at Wilson again) I did my time, okay?  My sister, her ol' man's up in Chino right now doin' eight years. 
WILSON (re the family inside) This ain't your lot? 
ED You kiddin', man?  I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth. 
And yet -- he lives here.  Wilson declines to pursue the matter. 
ED I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me. 
WILSON (calmly smoking) I only asked. 
Ed sighs.  Reaches for one of Wilson's cigarettes. 
ED Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer asked me to drive her downtown.  Said she was meeting -- her boyfriend -- Valentine.  But I think she was looking for him. 
FLASH CUTS: 
ED AND JENNIFER. In a car, downtown. She has the same steely intensity as her father. Ed looks a little worried. 
WILSON (lighting Ed's cigarette) What, tryin' to catch him with another bird? 
ED That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else. 
WILSON Where abouts? 
FLASH CUTS: 
JENNIFER. Talking to a beefy SUPERVISOR. Or talking at him. Either way, he isn't happy. 
MEAT PUPPETS. Watch instead of working. 
ED. Taking all this in. 
ED Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down. (anticipating Wilson's next question) I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos. 
WILSON Did Jenny know? 
ED (shrugs) Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say. (stands up again) But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing them.  Checking them out. (beat) I felt like she was covering my ass that day. 
Unconsciously rubbing his arms where his tattoos are. 
ED I drove her back to Valentine's house. 
FLASH CUT: 
VALENTINE. Standing in front of his house. His expression says: We have something to discuss. 
ED He was standing outside waiting for her. That's the only other time I ever saw him. (a short sad note) Last time I saw her. 
He meets Wilson's gaze.  As hard and pointed as a drill through his skull. 
CUT. 
INT. ED'S CAR.  NIGHT. 
Ed drives Wilson back to his motel.  Wilson silent.  Ed still not quite sure who he's dealing with.  Is this really or merely a grieving dad? 
ED What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops? 
WILSON Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they. 
ED Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ... (beat) Those curves don't kid around. 
Could be talking about the girl.  Wilson doesn't move.  But touch him, he'll explode.  Out the window lights are passing, but no landmarks.  He might as well be on the moon. 
ED You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend. 
WILSON She didn't write to me, did she. 
ED She didn't know what to say. (shrugs) I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her. 
WILSON Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever? 
ED (self-conscious again) Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think. 
WILSON (re Ed's tattoos) I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service. 
ED I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison. 
INT. WAREHOUSE. 
A SUPERVISOR (the one from the flash cuts) does a double take as Wilson passes. 
SUPERVISOR Hey! 
Wilson stops and turns.  Says nothing. 
SUPERVISOR How'd you get in here. 
WILSON Walked. 
SUPERVISOR You walked. (coming over) What the hell are you doing here. 
WILSON Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him? 
MEAT PUPPETS (who we saw before as well) who work here gathering.  The Supervisor and the Meat Puppets exchange glances. 
SUPERVISOR He's expecting you? 
WILSON (beat) I doubt it. 
The Supervisor moves toward Wilson. 
SUPERVISOR So why would he want to see you. 
WILSON I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson. 
SUPERVISOR Jennifer Wilson. 
More looks are exchanged. 
WILSON You know her? 
SUPERVISOR Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now. 
Wilson stares at him. 
WILSON Is Valentine here? 
SUPERVISOR What do you think? 
Wilson looks at the Meat Puppets, the loading area. 
WILSON Where is he, then? 
SUPERVISOR Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions? 
Wilson just looks at him. 
SUPERVISOR Do you hear me, asshole? 
The Supervisor shoves him.  The Meat Puppets move a little in anticipation.  Wilson isn't giving any indication that he's going to leave. 
SUPERVISOR Jesus, you really want your ass kicked, don't you? 
He pushes Wilson again, hard. 
SUPERVISOR Go on, get outta here. 
He pushes Wilson again.  Still, Wilson won't leave. 
SUPERVISOR Fuckin' nut.  Go on. 
This time he tries to slap Wilson.  Wilson blocks the Supervisor's hand and then punches him, hard.  The Supervisor stumbles back and falls to the floor. 
THE MEAT PUPPETS 
Move to Wilson.  He tries to fend them off, but there are too many.  They beat him.  When they find that he's armed, they beat him harder. 
CUT. 
EXT. BUILDING.  DAY. 
Wilson is taken outside and dumped.  After a moment, he gets to his feet.  Dusting himself.  Reaches for ANOTHER GUN tucked in his lower back.  He re-enters the building. 
A beat.  We hear several SHOTS. 
Seconds later, one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of the door, terrified.  He runs past us, fast. 
A moment later, Wilson emerges, gun in hand. 
WILSON You tell him.  You tell him I'm coming!! 
VALENTINE That's what Gordon's always saying. 
ADHARA Oh, god. 
His cell phone rings. 
VALENTINE (into phone) Yes. 
He listens, then looks up at his balcony, where a MAN (AVERY) stands holding a phone, obviously talking to Valentine. 
VALENTINE (into phone) I'll be there as soon as I can. 
He hangs up. 
VALENTINE (cont'd) We can leave as soon as you're ready. 
ADHARA Okay. 
EXT. BALCONY.  EVENING. 
Valentine approaches Avery. 
VALENTINE What. 
AVERY There's been some trouble downtown. 
VALENTINE What kind? 
AVERY What the papers used to call a "gangland slaying." 
VALENTINE Our black friends? 
AVERY No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message. 
VALENTINE I thought he was in prison, in England. 
AVERY Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you. 
Valentine is a little ruffled.  Maybe Avery likes that. 
VALENTINE What do we do? 
Beat. 
AVERY We wait, and we watch. 
Valentine just looks at him. 
EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  POOLSIDE.  EVENING. 
Adhara approaches Valentine, who stands staring at the pool. 
ADHARA Italian? 
VALENTINE I'm sorry. 
ADHARA Italian. 
VALENTINE Who? 
ADHARA Not who, food.  Should we get Italian. 
VALENTINE Sure. 
Turns to her. 
VALENTINE (cont'd) Yes.  Are you ready? 
ADHARA As long as I don't have to pass Gordon again.  I'm never ready for that. 
He smiles, rises, and offers her his hand. 
VALENTINE No.  I know another way out. 
She takes it. 
CUT. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING.  EVENING. 
ELAINE on her way in.  Handsome woman.  Intelligent, capable- looking.  Passes Wilson who's leaning somewhere smoking. 
ELAINE 
WILSON ... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses. 
ELAINE Sounds like Beverly Hills. 
WILSON Here, are you always this sarky? 
ELAINE Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go. 
WILSON Weren't you on a television series? 
ELAINE (has he seen it?) If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie? 
WILSON (yes) Said it went on for donkey's years. 
ELAINE Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. (blinks coquettishly) I was wife number three -- the ingenue. 
WILSON Oh, it just ended, then. 
ELAINE Now who's being sarcastic? 
WILSON When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean. 
ELAINE I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went. (raises her drink) It must've been the bars. 
Their food arrives. 
ELAINE It's a kind of prison, doing a series. Early to bed, early to rise, no time off for good behavior, you grab the boodle for as long as it lasts. (the kicker) Only difference is you can't get arrested afterwards. 
Wilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the table.  Ice cubes CLINKING as he holds his.  A BUSBOY bringing them to other people, too, just like that, without anyone even asking. 
WILSON I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed. 
ELAINE Not embarrassed. 
WILSON (correcting) Ashamed. 
ELAINE Not ashamed. 
Wilson looks at her.  Okay.  What then. 
ELAINE Disappointed. 
WILSON She never told Eddie, though. 
ELAINE She never told anyone else. (making light now) About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past. 
WILSON How'd you manage that, then. 
ELAINE When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look. 
WILSON Yeah, well, she started all that in London. 
ELAINE Modelling. 
WILSON Learnin' 'ow to speak proper. (putting it on a bit there. Then, upper crust:) Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper. (indicating himself) Show up the old man, you know. 
Elaine smiles slightly.  None of this information new to her. But warming to this man. 
ELAINE You weren't disappointed in her, then. 
WILSON In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't. 
ELAINE She was twenty-one when she came to me. (looks at him) ... Straight from leaving you. 
WILSON Footloose and fancy free. 
ELAINE She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't. 
It's because Wilson thinks the opposite that he's here. Looks at Elaine. 
WILSON That's the trouble, n' it. (hard as nails again) She enjoyed life. 
CUT. 
EXT. OCEANFRONT.  NIGHT. 
They walk along the seafront.  We HEAR the ocean but can't see it. 
ELAINE When did you get in? 
WILSON Yesterday.  Afternoon. 
ELAINE (occurs to her) You haven't been lurking outside my building all day. 
WILSON Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren -- 
ELAINE -- Your employer? 
WILSON -- Mr. Lindgren. 
ELAINE Who's Mr. Lindgren? 
WILSON My employer. 
ELAINE What line is he in. 
WILSON Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding. 
ELAINE I see. 
WILSON Based in London, but with international concerns. 
ELAINE I bet. 
WILSON Various enterprises, style of thing. 
ELAINE I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life. 
WILSON Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly. 
ELAINE (she gets the picture) Right. 
WILSON Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you. 
ELAINE In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren? 
WILSON This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means. 
ELAINE -- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him. 
They sort of come together -- in mutual understanding -- and sit down.  Coffee steaming. 
ELAINE So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about. 
WILSON Why not. 
ELAINE Are you serious. 
WILSON Have you ever known me not to be. 
Elaine looks away: 
ELAINE You fuckin' guys and your dicks. 
WILSON What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All]. 
ELAINE You don't believe it was a car accident. 
WILSON What do you think. 
ELAINE Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type. 
WILSON Depends, don' it. 
ELAINE On what.  What makes you so certain. 
WILSON I'll bloody well ask him. 
ELAINE There's the phone.  You want his number. 
WILSON 
That look again. 
WILSON I got his number. 
ELAINE 
Past caring. 
ELAINE I'm not going to help you. 
She goes into a bathroom.  Shutting the door behind her. 
WILSON 
Sips coffee.  Bites into a cookie. 
WILSON First in, first out, that's me. 
Looking over to note the multi-car GARAGE off the main house. 
INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON. 
Wilson and Ed are among the first to arrive.  A smattering of other GUESTS.  Elaborate catered cuisine.  They mosey over to the wet bar. 
BARTENDER Gentlemen.  What can I get you. 
WILSON (suggesting Ed take first crack) Dubonnet with a twist?  Baby sham? Tomato juice and Tabasco sauce? 
By now his whole dynamic with Ed is a verbal tease. 
ED (to Bartender) Got a Coke? 
INT. VALENTINE'S BEDROOM.  AFTERNOON. 
Valentine is checking himself in a full-length mirror.  TV on in background, sound low (ENTERTAINMENT WEEK!).  Not quite satisfied, Valentine crosses to the bathroom. 
BATHROOM 
Valentine takes one more closer look. 
ADHARA (O.S.) You have the same posters. 
Valentine turns. 
VALENTINE Hmm? 
ADHARA 
Is lounging in the large tub.  Staring dreamily at a couple of framed posters on the walls:  more 60's psychedelia. 
ADHARA That you have down at your office. 
Valentine sits on the edge of the tub.  With a nostalgic air as he looks at her:  the embodiment of youth. 
VALENTINE Different ones. 
He strokes her wet skin.  They kiss lightly. 
ADHARA I like the colors. 
VALENTINE We all did. 
ADHARA It must've been a time.  A golden moment. 
Beat. 
VALENTINE Have you ever dreamed of a place ... you don't really recall ever having been to ... a place that probably doesn't even exist except in your imagination ... somewhere far away, half-remembered when you wake up ... but when you were there you spoke the language, you knew your way around ... (significant pause) That was the 60's. 
With that exit line (practiced?), he starts to go. 
Then pauses, turns again. 
VALENTINE No, it wasn't.  Wasn't either. 
Comes back to her.  Faraway look in his eyes. 
VALENTINE It was '66 ... early '67. (comes back to now) That was all. 
He goes. 
INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY.  AFTERNOON. 
Wilson wanders around, exploring the house.  Comes to a wall of photographes.  Casually scanning them as he passes slowly by, he's caught up short by one. 
POV 
A framed photo of JENNY, his daughter. 
WILSON 
A series of emotions play over his face.  He turns -- SEES Valentine coming down the stairs.  Valentine joins the party without noticing him. 
BY THE BUFFET TABLE 
Ed peruses the available food.  Valentine comes over to check it out.  Glances at Ed without recognizing him. 
VALENTINE Hi. 
And goes away.  Leaving Ed more nervous than ever. 
GUY That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there. 
WILSON Yeah? 
GUY Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees. 
WILSON No kidding. 
GUY What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying? 
WILSON Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that. 
GUY Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you. 
WILSON Yeah.  Cheers, mate. 
The Guy leaves.  Wilson sees that Adhara is now on the other side of the room, separated from Valentine.  He heads for her. 
VALENTINE 
Still dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his attention.  He notices: 
WILSON AND ADHARA 
Talking in a corner.  She seems attentive. 
VALENTINE 
In a SERIES OF CUTS, still being the gracious host, still keeping his eyes on: 
WILSON AND ADHARA 
Who, in a SERIES OF CUTS, continue to talk.  Finally, they separate, Wilson heading outside onto a deck. 
VALENTINE 
Excuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her. 
ADHARA 
Valentine approaches and begins talking to her, low.  After a few moments of conversation, they both look toward: 
WILSON 
On the deck outside.  Joining Ed, who's taken refuge out here with a plate of food.  What Wilson can't belleve when he SEES it -- is that behind Valentine's house, which is on top of a high hill, is nothing but desolate scrub canyon.  On the other side of the railing around the deck, which is surely less than regulation height, is a sheer drop into an abyss. 
WILSON (cont'd) (jumps back with only slightly affected vertigo) Flipping heck. 
Ed, a little more accustomed to L.A. architecture, nods in agreement. 
ED If you could afford a house like this you would buy a house like this. 
Wilson edges forward to the rail again. 
WILSON What are we standing on? 
ED Faith. 
They stand there looking out.  Quite a view once you get used to it.  Breeze. 
ED (cont'd) (nods to the hazy distance) You could see the sea from here if you could see it. 
WILSON Could you? 
But now Ed gives Wilson a nudge -- SEEING that Valentine inside the house is making his way out here. 
WILSON Why don't you go nick one of those little cooker what's its warming up the sausages cocktail and meet me in the garage.  Look about for a toolbox while you're at it. 
Ed considers.  His is not to reason why. 
ED Okay. 
Ed moves off.  Valentine steps up, smile fully loaded. 
VALENTINE Hi.  Terry Valentine. 
He extends his hand.  Wilson shakes it. 
WILSON Pleasure. 
VALENTINE Have we met?  There's something I can't quite -- 
WILSON EMI in London.  I work with Ian. 
Valentine had turned his attention back to Adhara and her Girlfriend.  When he glances back to the deck he's a little concerned not to see Gordon anywhere out there anymore -- just Wilson coming back in. 
WILSON 
Adjusting his jacket, walking back through the house.  Behind him, people are rushing to the railing and looking over.  A few yells of "Call an ambulance!" etc. are heard. 
VALENTINE 
Moves that way. 
WILSON 
Moving across the room towards the front door.  They are heading right toward each other. 
WILSON AND VALENTINE 
Pass each other, eyes locked, almost dream-like.  Wilson's eyes cold, though with the hint of a smile.  Valentine throws a last look back before reaching the deck. 
EXT. DECK. 
Valentine pushes through to look over the railing. 
HIS POV 
Gordon -- a crumpled, inert heap way down the hill below. 
VALENTINE 
Turns to look toward the front door.  Wilson not to be seen. Valentine pushes through the crowd toward the door. 
EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON. 
Valentine emerges in time to see Ed and Wilson pulling away. Wilson looks at him, impassive, through the passenger window. 
AVERY 
Is just arriving in his car.  Valentine gestures at him. Suddenly we HEAR a loud, bass-heavy WHHUUUMMMPPP. 
Valentine (and a few others) turn toward the sound, which came from: 
THE GARAGE 
There is smoke coming from under the door. 
EXT. CANYON ROAD.  AFTERNOON. 
Wilson's car practically tobogganing back down the hill. BOOM!  We hear an explosion from back UP the hill. 
INT. WILSON'S CAR. 
Ed jumps -- though he's driving.  The gas pedal his most pressing concern.  Negotiating the dangerously winding road comes second.  Exhilaration mixed with panic. 
WILSON Steady on. 
ED You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there. 
EXT. ROAD. 
An especially sharp curve looms ahead. 
WILSON 
Flinches, grabs a handhold. 
CURVE 
Car makes it around on two side wheels. 
WILSON 
Gulps. 
WILSON Bloody hell. 
Ed regains control. 
AVERY 
In his car, takes a different turn. 
EXT. ROAD.  CAR. 
Swerves some more curves.  Should be some sense here that a similar skyline route would have been taken by Wilson's daughter on her final drive. 
AVERY (more concerned about police presence) What did you tell them. 
Valentine blows air, runs a hand through his hair. 
VALENTINE I told them a long-time employee flipped out.  Had a drug problem, refused counselling.  Set the garage on fire, then committed suicide.  One of my "guests" tried to stop him -- but how do you stop Gordon. 
In this context meaning how did that rangy Englishman do it. 
VALENTINE I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds. 
AVERY Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story. 
VALENTINE As it happens.  I didn't make that part up. 
AVERY And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him. 
VALENTINE I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split. (another notion) Maybe he was Gordon's pusher. 
Avery stares at Valentine.  Impressed at him thinking on his feet. 
VALENTINE Where do you think he is, Mike. 
AVERY (already turning) We'll find him. 
VALENTINE (stops him) No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now. 
AVERY You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here. 
VALENTINE You think I'm staying? 
AVERY There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons. 
VALENTINE Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me. 
He's being glib, but he's being serious.  His open-handed gesture inquiring of Avery:  are you up to the task? 
AVERY I have other resources. 
He turns to go. 
EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  CANYON.  AFTERNOON. 
The huge dead bulk of Gordon hoisted back up to the deck by a paramedic team. 
INT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. 
Valentine comes back in.  In the living room beyond, Adhara stands anxiously, where she's been waiting for him.  Cops visible outside on the deck, peering over the edge. 
VALENTINE 
Heading that way.  Then stops.  Backtracks.  Something peripherally had caught his eye and he returns to it.  His wall of photographs. 
AN EMPTY FRAME 
The one that had contained the picture of Jenny. 
CUT. 
INT. WILSON'S CAR.  AFTERNOON. 
Safely down the hill.  Driving away in traffic, Ed calmer now. 
WILSON 
Pulls the rolled-up photograph of his daughter out of his jacket and looks at it. 
CUT. 
INT. POOL HALL.  NIGHT. 
Two characters stand, leaning, against a back wall.  Staring ahead, without purpose.  Halfheartedly watching a game of pool in progress.  Just hanging out.  Strange, threatening characters.  One of them is young.  Lean, hungry-looking. STACY is his name.  A shrewd, scheming kid.  But definitely a little unhinged.  Weirder is his companion.  UNCLE JOHN.  The title isn't one of courtesy.  He's an actual blood relative. Maybe 25 years older than Stacy.  But intellectually younger. Physically, much bigger.  The man is huge.  Nevertheless, the safer of the two -- until Stacy tells him otherwise.  Way they're standing next to each other suggests the ease they feel in each other's company.  Tight bond.  They're good buddies. 
AVERY 
Walks in.  Stops to look around.  Spots his two freaks. Walks toward them. 
DOORWAY 
A mysterious black man has followed Avery in.  THOMPSON is his name.  He hangs back and watches. 
AVERY 
Makes contact. 
She's sitting on the bed now. 
CUT. 
EXT. MEAN STREET.  NIGHT. 
Stacy, putting on a jacket that says "Bomb Hanoi" comes out of the pool hall.  Uncle John in tow. 
UNCLE JOHN How much. 
STACY Five thousand. 
UNCLE JOHN (impressed) Hey. 
STACY (taps pocket) I got half. 
UNCLE JOHN Makin' trouble for someone? 
STACY Yeah. 
UNCLE JOHN Which kind? 
STACY The forever kind. 
BEHIND THEM 
Thompson, the mysterious black man, watches them from the hall doorway. 
CUT. 
EXT. WILSON'S MOTEL.  MORNING. 
Early. 
INT. WILSON'S ROOM. 
Wilson and Elaine.  Getting dressed.  She's in pantyhose. Fastening a bra.  He's got trousers on, reaching for a shirt. 
WILSON How long've you lived here? 
Elaine sits on the bed, fastening her skirt.  Her bra strap cuts across her bare back. 
ELAINE This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's." (thinks back) Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me. 
WILSON Early 70's.  I was away. (tries to remember) Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton. 
ELAINE These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide? 
Wilson looks at her:  she's the one who goes to bed with ex- cons. 
WILSON You don't seem bothered. 
ELAINE You don't know how I've compromised my standards. 
WILSON Tell us about it. 
ELAINE It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one. (quickly) SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild. 
WILSON Oh, I was gonna say ... 
ELAINE Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits. 
WILSON I can see the attraction. 
She glances up at him to try and see how he means that.  Is he looking at her or out the window? 
ELAINE What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you. 
WILSON A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- after we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it. 
ELAINE You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess. 
WILSON We were lucky to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing. 
ELAINE It didn't discourage you, though. 
WILSON Hey? 
ELAINE From pursuing your chosen profession. 
WILSON I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely. 
ELAINE I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo. 
AT THE STAIRS 
Three BLACK GUYS.  Including Thompson.  They approach.  Guns pointed at Stacy and Uncle John. 
WILSON 
Hand on his .45 now.  But a fourth Black Guy coming up behind him.  Wilson lowers the .45. 
ELAINE 
Flattened herself back against a wall.  Petrified. 
STACY 
Sits on the floor.  Holds his hurt face.  Thompson walks over and picks up Stacy's gun.  One of the other blacks relieves a reluctant Uncle John of his. 
THOMPSON (stops at Wilson) Come with us. 
If there's any doubt whether Wilson will -- one of the blacks gently puts the muzzle of a gun to Elaine's head.  Cocks the hammer. 
They all go off down the stairwell.  Except Stacy and Uncle John. 
Hit men wondering what hit them. 
CUT. 
INT. ROOM.  DAY. 
Like Wilson's motel room, another version of a cell. 
A small window, high up.  Bricks and debris around the floor. And Wilson and Elaine.  Sitting, leaning against opposite stone walls. 
ELAINE Tell me you wouldn't prefer a steady income. 
Wilson takes a cigarette pack from a pocket.  Lights himself one.  Then tosses the stuff over to Elaine. 
WILSON I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole. 
ELAINE (lights up) A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick. 
WILSON I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids. 
Elaine sort of shares a laugh at that. 
ELAINE Yeah ... Jenny spoke fondly of her imaginary siblings. 
Though real ones might have been nice.  This an unspoken thought between them. 
ELAINE (cont'd) Do you remember the last time you saw her? 
WILSON Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up -- (finding the word) in increments. 
ELAINE She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her. 
WILSON Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO. 
ELAINE Still, you could never ... do what she wanted. 
Wilson shakes his head. 
WILSON She used to tell me she'd turn me in. (tries to laugh about it) Little kid.  Ten year old.  "If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya."  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  "I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke. 
ELAINE She never would have turned you in, not in a million years. 
WILSON I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it wasn't a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out. 
DOOR opens.  Thompson.  Gun in hand. 
CUT. 
INT. HALLWAY.  DAY. 
Thompson leads Wilson past a row of windows.  Dockyards, harbor activity outside.  Toward a door with things stencilled on it.  One of them:  US DEPT. OF CUSTOMS. 
INT. OFFICE. 
A man named FEATHER.  Black.  Half sitting on the edge of a table.  Wilson is shown in. 
Wilson at the door.  Sizes Feather up at a glance. 
WILSON This is where I come in. 
He walks confidently in.  Outside, through the window, an image of a foreign sports car being hoisted in the air by a crane. 
They're playing against a couple of other creeps. 
CREEP You broke last time. 
STACY Let him break - he likes to break. 
CREEP Fuck you. 
STACY I wouldn't talk. 
CREEP Huh? 
STACY I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean? 
Creep rushes Stacy.  But doesn't get past Uncle John.  Who drops him with one punch.  Flooring him between two pool tables.  Stacy then goes over.  Supports himself with a hand on each table, swings his boot into the thug's face. 
BARTENDER (calls) Stacy. 
Stacy looks.  Bartender holds up phone.  Stacy goes over. 
BARTENDER (cont'd) I can do without you inhibiting my business. 
Stacy just scowls, takes the phone. 
STACY (into phone) Yeah. 
UNCLE JOHN 
Breaks. 
STACY 
Hangs up.  Goes back to Uncle John.  Picks up his cue again. 
STACY (cont'd) We've been fired. 
CUT. 
EXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  L.A.  DAY 
Someone we've never seen before and will never see again stands in Valentine's driveway.  His name is FIELDING. 
A car comes up.  Another guy, GRAMMS, sits in it.  He waits. Eventually Fielding walks over. 
GRAMMS (re:  the burnt garage) Valentine had himself a party, I hear. 
FIELDING (by rote) My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events. 
GRAMMS A statement?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, my client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client. 
FIELDING Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific. 
GRAMMS Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell? 
FIELDING My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager. 
GRAMMS So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money. 
FIELDING He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely. 
GRAMMS Where is he now? 
FIELDING He had urgent business in the north. 
Gramms just laughs.  Just laughs and laughs.  And we leave him laughing.  And Fielding not. 
CUT. 
INT. RESTAURANT.  KITCHEN.  DAY. 
Ed takes off an apron, heads out the door.  It's clear that he's not the head chef here -- because the HEAD CHEF, an Anglo, turns, wondering where he's going.  Over this we hear: 
WILSON (over) Where's Big Sur? 
ELAINE (over) Up the coast. 
WILSON (over) How far? 
ELAINE (over) I don't know -- few hours, I guess. 
WILSON (over) Fancy it? 
ELAINE (over) I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation. 
STACY You bet. 
UNCLE JOHN Like what. 
STACY Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs "plausible denial." 
UNCLE JOHN Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong. 
STACY (savage mimicry) "He ain't wrong."  Listen, I know this asshole who did just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  That's the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job. 
UNCLE JOHN I don't get it. 
STACY I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of -- (finding the word) -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. Avery wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere. 
UNCLE JOHN What's in it? 
STACY (shrugs) Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky. 
UNCLE JOHN How we gonna get that lucky? 
STACY While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in. 
CUT. 
EXT. HIGHWAY.  DAY. 
Wilson's car. 
Closer to Big Sur.  Scenery more magnificent. 
INT. WILSON'S CAR. 
Ed still driving.  Wilson next to him.  Opening a new cigarette pack. 
ED I've been wondering something. 
WILSON Again? 
ED Do you have any friends, man? 
WILSON Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads. 
ELAINE (a little more pointed) Friends and colleagues. 
WILSON You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ... 
ELAINE Poor baby. 
Little back-seat sarcasm there.  Wilson looks kind of bitter. 
WILSON Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once. 
ED What post office? 
WILSON The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn. 
ELAINE You're just on a higher plane, Wilson. 
WILSON Too bleeding true, 'n' it. 
Flicks some cigarette pack paper out the window. 
EXT. HIGHWAY. 
The car speeds along. 
CUT. 
EXT. HOUSE.  BIG SUR.  DAY. 
An impressive clifftop dwelling.  Isolated on a winding road. On a beautiful promontory overlooking the sea.  Valentine RINGS the DOORBELL (actually CHIME).  It's opened by his ex- wife.  SUSAN.  Very well-maintained.  50-something. Surprised to see him.  But not overjoyed. 
VALENTINE Hello there. 
SUSAN What are you doing here? 
VALENTINE Exercising my visitation rights. 
SUSAN Since when? 
VALENTINE I miss my kids. 
SUSAN They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore. 
EXT. DECK.  BIG SUR HOUSE.  NIGHT. 
Adhara sways in a hammock.  Staring at Valentine.  Wanting to know what the hell is going on. 
Valentine stands smoking at the rail, looking out over the dark sea.  Ignoring Adhara.  Avery sits at a table. Bodyguards visible inside the house. 
VALENTINE (finally, to Avery) Do any of these guys cook? 
CUT. 
EXT. MOTEL PORCH.  EVENING. 
Wilson at the car.  Elaine and Ed watching. 
Ed has gathered that something has developed between Wilson and Elaine.  The way she's looking at Wilson. 
ED ... Reminds me of Jennifer. 
ELAINE (barely perceptible nod) Hard to miss. 
Ed sighs.  Awkward. 
ED I thought maybe you just came for the ride. 
ELAINE I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A. 
Wilson walks back to them.  Looking at Ed as if to say, ready to go?  At her as if to say ... maybe farewell. 
EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  NIGHT. 
Tableau.  Evening has descended.  Surfaces glisten from a light drizzling rain. 
INT. VALENTINE HOUSE, BEDROOM.  NIGHT. 
Adhara, dressing.  Behind her, outside, way out of focus, a figure slithers by. 
INT. VALENTINE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT. 
Valentine and Avery sit watching TV (CELEBRITY REPORT!).  Tom is behind them in the kitchen, flipping through Marie Claire magazine. 
VALENTINE 
Turns to look through the sliding glass doors. 
HIS POV 
Beyond the deck stands Larry, his back to us, facing the ocean. 
EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  BACK YARD.  NIGHT. 
Looking toward the house, Larry in the foreground, facing us. He takes a bite from a cinnamon granola bar, then looks at it unhappily as he chews. 
LARRY Fuck. 
EXT. VALENTINE HOUSE, ANOTHER ANGLE.  NIGHT. 
Looking at the house from the top of the hill.  Rick stands in the driveway next to Valentine's car, smoking a cigarette. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Wilson and Ed watching him.  Wilson nods his head to the left, and Ed moves in that direction.  Wilson moves quietly off to the right. 
INT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT. 
Valentine and Avery, still watching TV. 
VALENTINE (re:  the channel) Check the news. 
Avery starts looking around. 
AVERY Where's the remote? 
Suddenly, we hear a CAR ALARM.  Tom looks up from his magazine.  Valentine looks to Avery, who shakes his head: It's nothing. 
EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  DRIVEWAY.  NIGHT. 
Rick turns and looks up the driveway toward the sound.  He puts his cigarette out. 
EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK YARD.  NIGHT. 
Larry has turned toward the sound as well.  Through a partially obscured side entrance, he sees Rick walking up the driveway. 
EXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  DRIVEWAY.  NIGHT. 
Screams again as his elbow of his gun hand disintegrates.  He slips on the first step and tumbles down, the gun bouncing beside him. 
UNCLE JOHN 
Sees this.  Stands up to cross the back porch.  Takes a step forward but is stopped by a bullet in the chest (about the only clean shot anybody makes).  He looks down at himself. 
UNCLE JOHN Shit. 
He looks up to SEE: 
AVERY 
Near death.  Gun in his good hand.  He squeezes the trigger again. 
UNCLE JOHN 
A small black hole appears in his cheek.  He blinks, begins to raise his hand to his face, and collapses. 
AVERY 
Exhales and rolls over. 
TOM 
Still trying to get to his feet.  He gives up and just lies there, panting. 
A HAND 
Reaches for the gun beside Tom.  Tilt up with it to reveal: 
ED 
He puts the gun in his jacket and slides away. 
INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT. 
Valentine and Adhara are still stuck behind the counter. Valentine sees the shadowy shape of Ed slipping behind the back porch. 
VALENTINE 
Decides to make a run for it, following Tom's route, away from Ed. 
ADHARA Where are you going? 
LIVING ROOM 
Valentine runs to the sliding door, smack into: 
WILSON 
Standing there.  Wet.  Mad.  He grabs Valentine by the shirt and pushes him back into the room. 
VALENTINE 
Bounces off the couch and onto the floor. 
WILSON 
Comes toward him. 
VALENTINE 
Grabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at Wilson.  It careens off Wilson's arm and shatters. 
WILSON 
Is almost on him now. 
VALENTINE 
Tries to scramble away.  Throwing anything he can get his hands on at. 
WILSON 
Who keeps coming.  He grabs Valentine, pulls him up, then throws him into the television. 
VALENTINE 
Crashes into the TV face first and bounces to the floor. 
WILSON 
Goes to him, grabs him by the neck with one hand and pulls out his gun with the other.  He seems about to speak when suddenly he screams instead. 
Out of bullets now.  Gun CLICKING crazily on empty.  He simply drops it. 
WILSON 
Now stands before him. 
THE TWO OF THEM 
Both breathing hard. 
WILSON Tell me. 
This is not what Valentine expected. 
VALENTINE What. 
WILSON Tell me. 
VALENTINE Tell you ... 
WILSON About Jenny. (closer) Tell me about Jenny. (closer) About the deal.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard. 
Wilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts strangling Valentine. 
WILSON Tell me.  Tell me about it, you fucking bastard. 
Easing up just enough for Valentine to sputter out a response. 
VALENTINE She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything. 
WILSON Why then.  Why did you do it! 
They're locked in a kind of embrace.  Sprayed by the waves crashing into the rocks.  Sweating and gasping and exhausted and hurt and furious. 
VALENTINE She didn't want to share it, she wanted to stop it.  To stop me.  She said she'd turn me in. 
WILSON 
Shock of recognition on his face.  At those words. 
VALENTINE She said, "You go ahead with this, I'll turn you in, Terry." 
Wilson sits back.  Panting.  Totally spent.  The two of them. Both on the ground now.  Whatever energy they had left drained -- Valentine from his confession, Wilson from hearing it. Valentine shaking, sobbing.  Still not realizing the pathetic folly of his actions. 
VALENTINE She was serious.  She would have done it. She had the phone in her hand.  She was going to do it. 
WILSON 
Knows that the girl he loved ... loved Valentine, too.  Having heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished. He gets up and walks away.  Leaving the quivering shell of Valentine behind. 
CUT. 
INT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT. 
Adhara wakes up.  Hand to her smashed cheek and mouth.  But it's not her hand.  It's Valentine's.  She sort of shuffles away from him along the floor.  Sits against a wall holding her face.  Valentine sits back against an opposite wall. They stare at each other. 
CUT. 
INT. PLANE.  DAY. 
Wilson, lost in thought.  Accepts a drink from a FLIGHT ATTENDANT.  We can see it pains him to reach for it. 
WILSON Ta. 
After setting the glass down, his other hand goes to the shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily dealt with. 
FLASH CUTS: 
WILSON. At the roadside hotel, grimacing. 
ELAINE. Cleaning his wound. 
Wilson rubs his shoulder.  The AMERICAN LADY in the seat beside him heard the way he said thanks to the Flight Attendant. 
LADY You're English. 
A small beat (which he takes each time he responds). 
WILSON Yeah, that's right. 
LADY I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back. 
WILSON

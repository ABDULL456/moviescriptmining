(BOND 18) 
Screenplay by Bruce Feirstein 
(for educational purposes only) 
FADE IN ON: 
EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN 
Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN 
We're looking down at what used to be called "The End of the Known World." A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding. 
In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine. 
Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging over a cliff: 
AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid. 
Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up the ice. A human figure. This is: 
JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007. 
Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but - 
CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head: 
BOND There has to be an easier way to earn a living. 
Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until - 
ANOTHER ANGLE - 
He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a toehold. But when he slams the second pick in - 
THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK - 
BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK - 
And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall. 
Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum. 
At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at: 
THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL - 
Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying. 
RETURN ON BOND - 
Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN. 
ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL - 
Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally frayed through. 
RETURN ON BOND - 
One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still, he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward. 
EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL - 
Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down - through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed. 
As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and - 
THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY - 
Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below. 
IN THE WATERBED - 
A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge, he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland. 
NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND) 
Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff: 
BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL - 
On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself. In other words: This was the only way in. 
RETURN ON BOND - 
007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold. 
He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow. 
EXT. SNOW-COVERED FOREST - BOND SKIS THROUGH THE PINES - 
EXT. MOUNTAIN CLIFF - 
Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below, amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down. 
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - 
Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to: 
A ROCK OUTCROPPING. 
Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on: 
A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV) 
50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES. 
Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side. 
BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING - 
Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT. 
THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT - 
He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions. 
THE SAME SCENE ON A VIDEO WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM, LONDON. 
BOND'S VOICE (over a speaker) Seven, in position. 
TANNER'S VOICE Roger, Seven. 
Watching this display is M, TANNER, and a handful of MILITARY BRASS, including a RUSSIAN GENERAL, BUKHARIN, and BRITISH ADMIRAL ROEBUCK, an aging sea-lion with no love for M, or MI-6. 
M deals with the humorless Admiral by, well, humoring him: 
M ... What were you saying, Admiral? Something about this 'not being a job for a wine-sniffing, skirt-chasing playboy spy?' 
TANNER Maybe. Maybe not. 
M Abort the cruise. 
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK It's too late - 
M GET BOND OUT OF THERE. 
TANNER One to seven - one to seven - 
BOND - SQUINTING THROUGH THE RIFLE AT THE OUTCROPPING - 
BOND Negative, one. NOT YET. 
THE TRUCK/MiG-l, ON THE GROUND/THROUGH THE SCOPE - 
THE BALD MAN slaps the back of the truck obscuring MiG-1. THE TRUCK PULLS AWAY, revealing MiG-l's WING. Hanging from the weapons pod: A NUCLEAR BOMB. 
BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING - 
Mutters a curse. 
MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - 
TANNER Soviet SB-9 nuclear torpedo. Yield, one kiloton. 
M Will the cruise set it off? 
TANNER Yes. 
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK (to Bukharin) Jesus. Can't you people keep anything locked up? 
GENERAL BUKHARIN We didn't know it was missing. 
M Get me the Prime Minister. Alert NATO, the CIA, the Pentagon. (presses a button:) Seven: This is a direct order. I want you out of there. Do you copy? 
THE ROCK OUTCROPPING - 
Bond's headset lies on top of the rock, along with the telescopic sight - still broadcasting. 
Find Bond, crouching BEHIND the rock. Automatic rifle in one hand, GRENADE in the other. He pulls the pin, hurls it 40 feet away. Pauses. Waits, counting down time. Then - 
BOND SPRINGS. SHOOTS at one of the CRATES. IT BLOWS UP, just as - THE GRENADE EXPLODES. 
There's PANIC ON THE GROUND. Men running everywhere as THE RADAR/ GATLING GUN spins, and SENDS A HAIL OF FIRE at Bond's diversion. 
And with this, BOND is off, SPRINTING INTO THE CHAOS. 
THE SAME SCENE - VIDEO SCREEN - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM. 
Stoned silence. Disbelief. Tanner whispers: 
TANNER God help him. 
THE CRUISE MISSILE - FLYING THROUGH A MOUNTAIN RAVINE - 
God help the rest of us. 
THE SECRET AIR BASE - 
As various factions shoot at each other (Who's the traitor?) Bond streaks toward the action. Without breaking stride, he swings his gun to the right: TWO BURSTS. THREE MEN DIE. Still running, he swings to the left: ANOTHER BURST. TWO MORE DOWN. 
Ahead, Bond sees the FLIGHT CREWS DASHING for the MiG's. He makes a beeline for MiG-1. 
ANGLE ON THE BALD MAN - 
Slamming the gate on the RED BOX in a cargo truck. Rushing to the passenger door. Climbing in. The SHORT ROUND MAN floors the accelerator, driving them away. 
THE CRUISE MISSILE - STARTING ITS DESCENT DOWN A MOUNTAIN 
MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - M, WATCHING HELPLESSLY - 
VOICE FROM WARSHIP Time to target: Thirty seconds. 
WIDE ON MiG-1 - 
The pilot climbs the ladder to the cockpit. Running at full tilt, BOND LEAPS, pulls the man down. They fall to the tarmac, FIGHTING. Bond SHOVES A KNIFE in the man's ribs, killing him. 
Kneeling, Bond takes the pilot's helmet off. He looks up: A MAN is coming at him with a GUN. In one unbroken move, Bond YANKS THE KNIFE from the pilot's body and THROWS IT - thwack - into the man's heart. 
ANGLE ON MIG-2'S PILOT - WATCHING THIS FROM HIS COCKPIT. 
RETURN ON BOND - CLIMBING INTO THE COCKPIT - 
Where the COPILOT (having climbed in from the other side,) sees it's not the right guy. As he fumbles for a weapon, BOND BASHES HIM WITH THE HELMET. The copilot collapses into his seat, unconscious. 
Bond settles into his seat, fires the engines, closes the double canopy, and begins taxiing out. 
THE CRUISE MISSILE - CROSSING OVER THE PERIMETER OF THE AIR BASE 
MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - ROEBUCK, TANNER, M, WATCHING, UNABLE TO BREATHE - 
HIGH ANGLE - THE RUNWAY - 
The CRUISE SKIMS IN DIRECTLY OVER BOND'S PLANE, speeding to takeoff. 
(INT. BOND'S MiG) BOND SHOVES THE THROTTLES TO THE FIREBALL AND - 
THE VIDEO-WALL - MI-6 SITUATION ROOM - 
KA-BOOM!!!! The scene on the screen erupts in a GIANT EXPLOSION - then turns to video-snow. Is Bond alive? No one in London knows. 
HIGH ANGLE - THE AIR BASE - 
The FIREBALL grows and grows, a raging hell. And just when it seems no one could possibly survive: BOND'S MiG ROCKETS OUT OF THE FLAMES!! 
INT. BOND'S MiG - 
Bond thinks he's safe. Sound. Until - 
MiG-2 FLIES OUT OF THE FIREBALL - 
Cannons blazing at 007. A hail of metal and tracers. 
INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG - 
Bond goes into evasive maneuvers - jinks right, jinks left - when, suddenly, THE COPILOT REVIVES, and starts trying to STRANGLE Bond with a METAL LANYARD. Struggling, Bond HEARS a THIN HIGH-PITCHED TONE - 
INT./EXT. MIG-2 
The pilot has locked onto Bond's MiG. Boom! TWO HEAT-SEEKING MISSILES roar away. 
INT./EXT. BOND'S MIG - 
Fighting the garrote, Bond KICKS THE THROTTLES forward and PULLS BACK ON THE YOKE. The MiG goes into a spine crushing climb as - 
THE TWO HEAT SEEKING MISSILES FOLLOW HIM, LOOPING UPWARD. 
INT. MIG-2 - 
Bond's MiG has disappeared from the pilot's view: Not in front. Not on the left. Not on the right. Where did he go? The pilot looks up: 
EXT. MI-6 LONDON - DAY 
The DB-5 drives past the guard. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Debriefing: Bond, M, and several others listen as NATO COLONEL DOMINIQUE EVERHART, (early 30's, Belgian,) refers to video clips from the Khyber Pass sequence: 
COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART To sum up: After analyzing the tire inflation of the fork-lift in the MI-6 video tape, NATO believes the "red box contains approximately eighty kilograms of U235 weapons grade uranium - an incredibly hard, incredibly heavy, incredibly lethal substance. 
M And that's enough enriched uranium to produce how many nuclear devices? 
COL. DQMINIQUE EVERHART Depending on the builder's sophistication - one crude bomb that could devastate London, Paris, New York, Berlin - or all four if they have the latest technology. 
There's a pregnant pause in the room. 
M And the participants? 
COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART (pointing at the screen) Kim Dae Yung. Moscow-trained North Korean nuclear weapons specialist; apparently fell out of favor with the current North Korean regime after a botched attempt to steal fissionable material from a British light-water reactor in South Africa - an accident that left him entirely hairless... 
Another face appears on the screen: 
COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART (cont'd) And Rendera Sikrahm, also known as Richard Stamper. Freelance mercenary, Laos and Cambodia. His father was from Nepal - a Ghurka warrior - con- scripted by the British government to fight in China during World War II - after which the family settled in Hong Kong, where the young Stamper was undoubtedly treated like a second class citizen by both the Hong Kong Chinese, and local British. (beat, aside:) We've all read about the signs at the British swimming pools in Hong Kong that said "No Ghurka's allowed." 
BOND Nothing like a little imperialism to promote loyalty among the faithful. 
COL. DOMINIQUE EVERHART (stifles a smile, then:) In conclusion: Both these men have a vendetta against the world. They are nuclear armed, and dangerous. And having failed to get the UZ35 through the old opium route - the Khyber Pass - it's NATO's belief that their next attempt will be through Bulgaria - where the NATO Nuclear Strike Force will be there to stop them. 
M Thank you Colonel Everhart. (stands, turns to:) 007, I'd like to see you in my office. Why don't you and the Colonel exchange numbers if you need more information? 
BOND Yes, M. 
M exits. Bond approaches Dominique. She smiles, warmly. There's a mutual attraction - but there's something else going on, unspoken. 
BOND Interesting presentation. 
DOMINIQUE Interesting video tape. 
BOND They point, I shoot. 
DOMINIQUE (feels her pockets) Do you have a pen? I just got promoted and don't have my new cards yet. 
BOND Of course. 
Bond hands her a PEN. She regards it cautiously. 
DOMINIQUE ... Does this do anything? 
BOND Depends what number you write. 
She gives him a wry look; starts to write. He notes her WEDDING BAND. 
BOND Married? 
DOMINIQUE Happily. 
BOND ... Kids? 
DOMINIQUE Three. You? Married? 
BOND No. 
DOMINIQUE (smiles) I didn't think so. 
For an instant, something crosses Bond's face: Bittersweetness? Re- morse? Either way, she's scored a subtle victory. 
DOMINIQUE Here. I gave you my assistant's phone number. If it's urgent, she knows where to reach me. 
BOND Thanks. (beat, holding her gaze) Take care - 
DOMINIQUE You too. 
With a Sphinx-like smile, she watches Bond leave. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE OF CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Where Bond encounters MONEYPENNY, also walking to M's office. 
BOND Moneypenny! We've got to stop meeting like this. They may be on to us. 
MONEYPENNY Hello, James. Enjoy your meeting? 
BOND In the darkest moments, it's what I live for. Especially since I've heard how much you like to watch... On the hidden camera. 
Moneypenny cuts Bond a look - and, in the background, sees Dominique leave the conference room, and walk down the hall, away from them. 
MONEYPENNY By the way, James: Ordinarily I would never ask, but... Weren't you and that Colonel once stranded on a raft for two weeks in the Sargasso Sea? 
BOND Moneypenny! How indiscreet! Have you ever known me to kiss and tell? 
They've come to a security door. She punches in a code - 
MONEYPENNY Actually, I've never known you to do either... But - 
BOND - We all want what we can't have? 
MONEYPENNY Not all of us, 007. 
The door opens. They go into: 
INT. M'S ANTEROOM (MONEYPENNY'S AREA) - CONTINUOUS 
BOND What - no lust for adventure? 
MONEYPENNY No, 007. It's just that I've learned from personal experience - that when we get what we want - (beat) Somehow the reality is never as... Satisfying as the fantasy. 
Bond scowls. Moneypenny smiles wryly, points to the inner door: 
MONEYPENNY Don't keep M waiting. 
INT. M'S OFFICE - DAY 
M is behind her desk; MINISTER PETER JOHNSTONE sits across - a high- handed Teflon-coated politician, with the survival instincts of plutonium. They've been arguing. 
M Come in, 007. You know the Minister? 
BOND Of course. (nods to) Minister Johnstone. 
MINISTER JOHNSTONE 
Bond sits in an armchair. M presses a button, and a video/bio of ELIOT HARMSWAY appears on the wall behind her. Mid-50's, regal. 
M Tell me, 007, what do you know about Elliot Harmsway? 
BOND (quipping) Only what I read in the newspapers. 
MINISTER JOHNSTONE (disdainfully) His newspapers? 
BOND (glancing sideways) Occasionally, yes. (directly to M) British media mogul. Born in Hong Kong; controls newspapers, TV, radio, cable, satellites; books, magazines, movies, computer software. Theme parks. 
M (holding up a copy of:) - Along with Tomorrow - the first world-wide newspaper. Circulation 27 million. Daily. - 
BOND (examining them curiously) Perfect way to tie up a... 'Knotty' problem? 
SAUNDERS (frowns) Moving along - (he produces:) A typical plastic security card. Name here, magnetic information stripe here - (pointing to) And a code breaking microprocessor here. Swipe it through any card reader - anywhere - you're in. 
BOND Does it work on cash machines? 
Saunders is suddenly stricken. Flustered. He blurts out: 
SAUNDERS It was an authorized test. I returned the money. 
BOND (amused) I see... 
SAUNDERS (ignoring this) Finally, your new watch: Blue laser here for signaling or burning through locks; press this button, the sweep hand becomes a Geiger counter. 
BOND (needling him) If you can't do the time, don't do the crime? 
SAUNDERS (smirks at Bond, pauses, then) Oh. I almost forgot. There is one last thing: Before Q retired, he asked that I give you one other protective device. 
He hands Bond a WEDDING BAND. 
BOND A wedding band??? What am I supposed to be able to do with this? 
SAUNDERS I believe Q's exact words were: (imitating Q, emphatically:) "Hopefully, nothing." 
Bond turns from Saunder's devious grin to an amused M. Smiles: 
BOND ...I'll give you a ring from Venice. 
M Good luck on your mission, 007. 
He snaps the ring down on her desk. 
BOND Till death do us part. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. VENICE HARBOR/GRAND CANAL - NIGHT 
A GLEAMING WHITE YACHT - with two on-board helicopters, and a huge tarped hold - dominates the harbor. (Harmsway's SEA DOLPHIN II.) 
Tonight, however, we find a GONDOLA, gliding through the water... 
Arriving at a festively-lit dock, crowded with gaily costumed partygoers and musicians in medieval garb. 
Wearing the mask from M's office, (and a bright blue cape,) Bond alights the gondola, and plunges into the crowd. 
EXT. PIAZZA SAN MARCO - NIGHT 
A swirl of colors, noise and music. Pushing his way into the chaotic celebration, Bond scans the crowd, looking for a face: 
NOTHING BUT A SEA OF MASKS. White. Yellow. Red. Blue. 
Caught up in the tumult, he turns left, he strains to turn right, anxiously looking for the contact. Who is it? 
THREE MASKED WOMEN appear in front of Bond. They curtsy, and giggle. 
WOMAN Buona sera, signore - 
He's spun by a MASKED MAN with a bottle. 
MAN Vino? 
Bond waves him off - and is jostled in the other direction, by a group of celebrants carrying a long banner. 
Suddenly, the CROWD SURGES FORWARD: A PROCESSION, carrying the EFFIGY OF CARNIVAL is making its way through the square. 
Locked shoulder to shoulder in the crowd, Bond struggles to look forward - left, right - when he FEELS A TUG at his cape from behind. He can only crane his neck to see/hear - 
MASKED WOMAN I may have been followed. Meet me at the Church in five minutes! 
With an effort, Bond turns to look at her - but sees nothing, save the wisp of a satin costume, disappearing as the crowd closes ranks behind him. 
SAN GIACOMO SQUARE - NIGHT 
Five minutes later. Almost deserted. A few stray couples. The MASKED WOMAN appears, walking tentatively between the shadows and the moonlight, looking for Bond. Suddenly - 
Whomp! - an arm reaches out, and yanks her into an alcove. 
BOND Looking for someone? 
Recovering her breath (it was a violent yank,) the woman - PARIS removes her mask. She shines a sexy, 1000-watt smile at 007: 
PARIS Hello, James. 
Bond reacts. He is not happy to see her. 
BOND Paris?!? What are you doing here? 
PARIS Is that any way to say hello? 
BOND I thought your specialty was good-bye. 
Paris smiles coyly. She LIFTS A HAND to tousle his hair - 
PARIS Oh, James. I've missed you - 
BOND (grabbing her by the wrist) Is this another one of your games? 
PARIS Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice? 
BOND I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense. 
She's surprised - and hurt - by his coldness. 
PARIS Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you? 
BOND Nothing. 
She turns away from him, fighting back tears. Bond doesn't care: 
BOND What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts? 
PARIS (anguished) No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans - (facing Bond, becoming hysterical:) You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love - 
BOND SLAPS HER. She's stunned. He waits. She's angered: 
PARIS Do you feel better now? 
BOND (not giving an inch) Do you? 
She turns away. Bond feels remorse for hitting her. Softens: 
BOND What about the uranium? 
PARIS It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow. 
Bond reaches out to touch her. She falls into his arms, burying her face in his shoulder. 
PARIS I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again. 
BOND (patting her head) Shhhhh... 
THUG #2 Marco - I didn't know - 
THUG #1 After him! 
They charge off. 
IL BOVOLO - COURTYARD - NIGHT 
Bond enters from the alley, scans the courtyard: Three walls. No way out... Save for a SPIRAL STAIRCASE that leads up to the FOURTH FLOOR INTERIOR BALCONY, overlooking the courtyard. 
THE SPIRAL STAIRS - 
Bond takes the marble steps, two at a time. 
RETURN ON THE COURTYARD - 
The two Thugs enter the square. Motioning for quiet, they HEAR BOND'S FOOTFALLS on the steps, and race up after him. 
THE BALCONY - 
Coming off the staircase, Bond tries the doors to the interior of the building: Locked. Too heavy to burst in. He glances down at the courtyard, and HEARS THE THUGS' FOOTSTEPS running up the stairs. 
Bond glances up to the roof, just above his head: The only escape. 
Pocketing his mask, Bond hops on the BANISTER, REACHES for the GUTTER. He pulls himself up, throws a leg over - onto the roof, and disappears from sight... 
Just as the Thugs enter the balcony from the staircase. 
FIRST ROOFTOP - 
Bond scurries along the steeply pitched terra-cotta roof. There are SHEER DROPS on three sides - but the fourth side is a one-story drop to an adjoining building. Bond jumps. 
SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP - 
007 lands on another steeply pitched roof; unable to get a foothold on the tiles, he slides down, rolling to the edge. He looks down: The adjoining building is one story lower, with a skylight roof. 
As Bond struggles to climb back to the peak of the second roof - 
RETURN ON THE BALCONY - 
Thug #1 holsters his gun, and climbs on the banister. He's too heavy to climb onto the roof by himself - so Thug #2 shoves him from below. 
FIRST ROOFTOP - 
Thug #1 searches for Bond. He HEARS BOND moving, below him, on the next building. He makes a running leap. 
SECOND (LOWER) ROOFTOP - 
Bond has hauled himself up to a crouch as Thug #1 lands. They grapple. The Thug sends Bond sliding down toward the edge of the roof, then loses his balance, and slides down after Bond. 
AT THE EDGE OF THE ROOF, Bond is about to slide off, onto the skylight below, but GRABS THE COPPER GUTTER at the last moment. 
007 is now hanging, fifteen feet above a glass skylight... As Thug #1 tumbles off the edge of the roof, and saves himself by GRABBING ONTO BOND'S LEGS. 
They sway in the air for a second. The GUTTER bends, breaks, and the two of them fall - 
CRASHING THROUGH THE GLASS SKYLIGHT, INTO: - 
VENICE MEDIEVAL ARMOR MUSEUM - NIGHT. 
They land in a shower of glass on the grand banquet table in the Great Hall. Bond is winded. Thug #1, unfazed. He grabs Bond by the collar, hauling him up on his feet. 
Thug #1 shoves the nose of his gun under Bond's chin, forcing 007 up on his toes. Snarling, he thrusts his face menacingly close to Bond: 
THUG #1 I owe you some pain. 
With lightning speed, Bond: 1) Grasps the Thug's elbow and yanks his gun arm forward, as, 2) Bond pitches his head back. Bond's chin just clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING. 
The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA, and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away. 
As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally (yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR. 
With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room. He's having fun. 
AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER - 
THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond. 
BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out of the way, like a gnat. 
Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug. 
Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE, and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed "King Arthur" type sword. 
With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO. The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to: 
A DISPLAY WALL - 
filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD. (Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks. Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax. 
THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug #1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax. 
NEW ANGLE - 
Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN. (Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.) 
Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden. 
As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club) 
Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN TWO... But loses the weapon in the process. 
Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.  - 
In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1 backwards, down onto the floor. 
AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX - 
THUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR. 
BOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL. HE TURNS TO SEE: 
THUG #1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM. 
And at the very last second, BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX, SLASHES THE IRON MAIDEN'S LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and - 
NEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDEN'S POV - 
The iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor. 
RETURN TO SCENE - 
The Iron Maiden covers all of Thug #1, except for his arm, still clutching Bond's gun. Bond bends down and retrieves it. 
BOND He fought hard... (holstering the gun) But the case was terminal. 
And on this note, we - 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. VENICE HARBOR - THE NEXT DAY - 
INT. CAFE - 
DiGiacomo sees the BLUE LASER. Motions his men to action. 
RETURN ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - TOPSIDE - 
Bond has sauntered to one of the hospitality bars, trying to remain ac inconspicuous as possible. A hand clasps his shoulder: 
VALENTIN'S VOICE Mr. James Bond! 
Bond spins to see Valentin, surrounded by the usual assortment of cheaply dressed goons. 
BOND Valentin. What an unpleasant surprise. 
VALENTIN What is it that brings you to Venezia, Mr. Bond? Business - (sly glance to the thugs) Or somebody else's business? 
The goons chortle. Bond isn't happy with this attention. He clocks a VIDEO SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ON ONE OF THE MASTS, scanning the deck. 
A WOMAN'S SHRILL WHINING VOICE - brings Bond back to Valentin. She is very colorfully dressed - dripping in high-ticket logos. 
SOFIA Dimitri!!! You promised I could go shopping!! 
VALENTIN (sotto, to Bond) New mistress. (to her, impatiently) So? Go! 
SOFIA I need money. 
Valentin gives a beleaguered shrug, and pulls out a HUGE WAD OF CASH. 
VALENTIN Here. Take an inch. 
Shaking his head, Valentin turns back to Bond: 
VALENTIN Come. Let me buy you a drink. It's free. 
With Bond keeping an eye on the surveillance camera, they move several steps to the bar. 
VALENTIN (to the bartender) Two vodka martini's. Shaken. Not stirred. (to Bond) And you? 
Bond would rather not drink - but knows that any change from his regular behavior might arouse suspicion. 
BOND One. 
As the bartender pours: 
BOND I must say, Valentin, capitalism seems to be treating you well. 
VALENTIN (belting one back) I used to sell weapons; now I buy votes. (then) Off the record. 
BOND Of course. If you can't beat the government, you might as well own it. 
Valentin spots someone off-camera. 
VALENTIN Wait - I want you to meet a friend of mine. (calling out) Elliot! Elliot! Come here. 
Harmsway appears. Ebullient as ever. 
VALENTIN Elliot Harmsway, I want to introduce you to an old friend - 
BOND (putting out a hand to shake) The name is Bond. James Bond. 
Harmsway greets Bond with a warm smile. Yet his words are ambiguous: 
HARMSWAY Always nice to meet one of her Majesty's fellow subjects... (a nod to Valentin) Especially one with such distinguished friends. 
BOND You might say I've always been one of Mr. Valentin's biggest followers. 
VALENTIN (chortling) 'Biggest followers?' He's practically made a career' of it!! 
He laughs. Bond decides to pull Harmsway's chain. 
BOND It's a beautiful boat, Sir Elliot. Practically glows in the dark. 
HARMSWAY (smiles) I can tell you're a man with an eye for exquisite possessions, Mr. Bond. (signaling off camera) Darling! Come here. (beat) I want you to meet my wife. 
A woman appears in frame, her face obscured by a large sun hat. As she reveals her face to the camera - and Bond - 
HARMSWAY Paris Harmsway, allow me to introduce you to James Bond. 
There is a terrified look on her face. Harmsway continues, beaming his most insinuating smile: 
HARMSWAY But then... I believe you two have already met. 
There is a beat - an uncomfortable moment when nobody speaks. Then - 
POLICE WHISTLES BLOW! SIRENS! SOUND OF TIRES SCREECHING TO A HALT! 
The entire party turns to see DiGIACOMO barging his way up the gangplank - wearing a ludicrous military uniform, trailed by UZI- TOTING CARBINIERI, along with his own VIDEO AND STILL CREWS. 
DiGIACOMO Elliot Harmsway: Under the auspices of the Italian government, I, Franco DiGiacomo - (pauses; smiles at a camera; POP! A flash goes off) Am arresting you for the illegal possession of weapons grade enriched uranium. (to his underlings) Seize the boat! 
A set of frozen glances goes from Bond, to Paris, to Harmsway. 
VALENTIN I think I suddenly remembered an urgent meeting in Moscow. 
To everyone's surprise, Harmsway guffaws. 
HARMSWAY My friends, there's been a terrible mistake. (putting his arm around DiGiacomo) Come. Let me show you. 
And he leads the procession off, through the bulkhead door. Bond is left with Paris. She is white with fear. Bond moves to console her: 
BOND Paris - 
PARIS Leave me alone! He's going to kill me!! 
BOND Why didn't you tell me? Why wasn't it in our files? 
PARIS (anguished) He didn't want anyone to know. He kept it out of the papers. He said a third wife was bad for his image. (beat) You've got to protect me! 
Bond wants to help her - and follow Harmsway. He pulls out a key: 
BOND Go to my hotel room. I'll be there in twenty minutes. 
Paris looks up at him like a hurt child. She wants some contact; she wants to hear him say 'I love you.' 
PARIS Just - say it. Say it just once. 
BOND (pauses, discomfited) One thing at a time. I'll see you in twenty minutes. Go. 
She exits; he goes to the bulkhead door... And we pan up to see the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA, following him. 
INT. METALLURGY LAB - SEA DOLPHIN II - 
Harmsway holds court near the red box. Bond squeezes in. 
HARMSWAY I believe this is what you're looking for, Colonel. 
He opens the red box. Hoists out a canister. 
HARMSWAY Is it uranium? Absolutely. But watch - (runs the Geiger counter over it) It's depleted uranium! Completely safe! A child could sleep on it. 
Bond can't believe what he's seeing. DiGiacomo is mortified. 
At microwave. His finger hovers over button, then stops. He opens the door of the microwave and takes out a bowl. Dumps the contents on the stove. 
INT. SHIP'S HEAD - 
CREW MEMBER with an ELECTRIC SHAVER. 
FIRST OFFICER (INTERCOM) All personal radios, video devices and computers will be stowed at once. 
He stops shaving. 
INT. ENGINE ROOM - 
The ENGINEER shouts to his crew, over NOISE OF DIESEL ENGINES: 
ENGINEER Check the engine baffles; rig the generators for shielded operation. 
RETURN ON THE BRIDGE - 
The First Officer stands next to the Communications Officer. 
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER Communications set to receive only, sir. 
The First Officer looks over the shoulder of RATING at radar screen. 
RATING Radar switched to passive mode; sonar re-set to low-power operation. (beat) You couldn't find our signature with a magnifying glass. 
FIRST OFFICER Let's hope so. 
The First Officer joins the Second Officer at the windows, scanning the horizon with binoculars. 
SECOND OFFICER Looks like we're in for a long, uncomfortable trip. 
FIRST OFFICER We'll all breathe a lot easier when we get this cargo back to London. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MANOR HOUSE - THE COAST OF SCOTLAND - DAY 
THE BAGPIPE AND DRUM CORPS of the Royal Highland Regiment (aka the "Black Watch") is playing a FUNERAL DIRGE outside a vast stone house, with a HARMSWAY NEWS HELICOPTER on the lawn, and LIMOUSINES, A HEARSE and a FLOWER CAR in the driveway. 
SIX MEN IN FORMAL MOURNING ATTIRE are entering the house. 
INT. GRAND ROOM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE - 
A SINGLE WHITE ROSE is added to a pile of white roses in PARIS HARMSWAY'S OPEN CASKET. 
REVEAL: We're in mid-procession: The last two (of the six men from outside) place roses in the casket... 
Then turn, nodding sorrowfully to ELLIOT HARMSWAY (sitting in the front row of a room that's keen turned into a makeshift chapel)... 
And follow hand signals of STAMPER, who motions them THROUGH A DOOR, to an unseen room. 
After the last man has paid his respects, HARMSWAY stands, walks to the bier, and - wiping away a tear - places a single RED ROSE in his dead wife's casket. 
INT. HARMSWAY'S INNER SANCTUM - SCOTTISH MANOR HOUSE - DAY 
We're in a room that looks as if it could only exist in, well, a James Bond movie: Slick, stark, sterile. Steel, glass, chrome. 
The SIX men are seated around a giant conference table, looking absurdly out of place in their formal mourning attire. 
Elliot Harmsway enters, (passing what appears to be the Liechtenstein that hangs in the lobby of CAA,) walks to the head of the table, takes off his gray mourning gloves, slaps them down, and: 
HARMSWAY Good morning, Gentlemen. I'm sorry to bring you here under these circumstances, but (beat) Considering our meeting was already scheduled, this was a happy coincidence. 
The men nod. Harmsway sits, dims the lights from a control panel. 
HARMSWAY (cont'd) Number One, your report? 
A gap-toothed Californian with bland features stands. 
NUMBER ONE Sir Elliot: The entertainment division is releasing three new animated children's movies this year. (pause) By the time we're finished promoting them on our TV, radio, cable, newspaper, and magazine outlets - (pause) There won't be a parent in the universe who won't feel guilty if they don't take their children to our stores and theme parks to buy the toys, books, video- games and clothing featuring our 'lovable little creatures.' (pause) We anticipate revenues of 3.1 billion dollars. 
HARMSWAY Excellent, Number One. Build a better rat-trap, and the world truly will beat a path to your theme park. (turns to) Number Two? 
A young guy with glasses gets up, looking remarkably like Bill Gates. 
NUMBER TWO As you're aware, Sir Elliot, our software division has introduced a new computer operating system, Gates '99. (beat) It's deliberately filled with bugs - so people will be forced to buy our upgrades over the next five years. (beat) The window on revenues is 2.8 billion. 
HARMSWAY Outstanding, Number Two. (beat, remembering:) By the way - Number Five - ? (a man looks up) Who's ahead in the American elections? 
NUMBER FIVE The Democrat, sir. By nine points. 
HARMSWAY Maybe it's time to publish that story about his sex life. Even things up. A close race is always better for our TV ratings. 
NUMBER FIVE Consider him slimed, sir. 
HARMSWAY Splendid. Next... (with noticeable reserve) Number Three. Your report? 
A SHORT MIDDLE-EASTERN MAN stands. Nervous. 
NUMBER THREE I regret to inform you, sir, that Saddam Hussein is still demanding a bonus for his role in the Gulf War. 
HARMSWAY ...Haven't we already paid him for his services? 
NUMBER THREE Yes, sir. But he still feels his people should share in the increased profits of our news division. He has proposed an additional 500 million dollar payment. 
A pause. The other men in the room shift uncomfortably. 
HARMSWAY ... And there's no truth that 10% of that money will go into your Swiss bank account? 
NUMBER THREE No sir! I swear! This is not true!! 
HARMSWAY You disappoint me, Number Three. 
Harmsway presses a button. Stamper enters. Number Three assumes this means death. He BEGS FOR HIS LIFE: 
NUMBER THREE Please sir. Please - 
HARMSWAY ...But because I am a just man, I've decided to give Mr. Hussein what he deserves. 
Number Three is confused. Does this mean he's going to live? 
HARMSWAY Mr. Stamper will escort you to the plane. 
NUMBER THREE (overwhelmed with gratitude) Thank you sir! Thank you! 
Harmsway nods, watching him leave: 
HARMSWAY Good-bye, Mr. Azziz. 
And the man is gone. Harmsway turns his attention back to the room: 
HARMSWAY Let's proceed with new business. 
Harmsway presses another button. The room darkens. The CENTER OF THE TABLE OPENS, and a 3-D MAP OF MALAYSIA rises into view. 
HARMSWAY Gentlemen: In exactly 36 hours, we are going to initiate phase one of the word's most perfect crime: The biggest theft in the history of mankind. (beat, pointing with a laser) Right here. In the Strait of Malacca. 
EXT. LIMOUSINE - MANOR HOUSE - DAY 
Stamper holds the back door open for Number Three. He gets in. 
FIRST OFFICER A dead head. (off the others' quizzical looks) Water logged timber. Floats straight up. You sometimes see them on the east side of the channel - from the logging camps on Sumatra - but they don't usually float this far west. (calling out) Muncy! Engines to half! 
HELMSMAN Aye-aye sir. Engines to half. 
FIRST OFFICER (explaining) Chew up a log like that in the propeller, you end up with enough paperwork to go from here to London. Twice. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
The ship is moving towards a DARK VERTICAL SHAPE - Harmsway's SEA-BED CORE BORING DRILL (shorthand "THE WORM',) attached to a long flexible dredging pipe. 
CLOSER - THE HEAD OF THE WORM - 
Motionless, hanging in the water. Then the monster awakes: A metal sphere retracts, revealing a wide angle CAMERA LENS. 
INT. BRIDGE - NIGHT 
The Communications Officer reacts to his monitor with ALARM: 
COMMUNICATIONS OFFICER I'm getting an electrical emission, sir! Extremely close. Bearing 240 - 
The First Officer is surprised. All hell is about to break loose:       - 
FIRST OFFICER Punch up the radar - 
RADAR OPERATOR I've got it, sir. A large craft - XX,OOO tons. Range - (disbelief) 200 yards? It's anchored in a cove! 
FIRST OFFICER That's impossible! We're in the middle of the channel! 
A Junior officer bursts in from the exterior bridge: 
JUNIOR OFFICER Breakers off the port bow! We're heading for shore! 
SONAR OFFICER Sir - 
FIRST OFFICER (reacting to the Jr. Officer) Full stop!!! Call the captain! 
SONAR OFFICER Sir! 
FIRST OFFICER (annoyed) What?!?! 
SONAR OPERATOR The log is moving! 
EXT. UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
Propelled by water-jets in its head, THE WORM STREAKS TOWARD THE INDOMITABLE, emitting a HIGH PITCHED whine as its drill bit revs up to speed. The drill's BLACK TEETH glisten in the water. 
THE WORM'S POV - (UNDERWATER, NIGHT) 
Closing in on the hull like a torpedo. It gets closer, picking up speed, until - on IMPACT - 
INT. ENGINE ROOM - 
A TORRENT OF WATER engulfs the Engineer and Crewmen when The Worm bursts/drills through the hull. As they scream, drowning - 
A CREWMAN ON THE GANTRY scrambles up, one step ahead of the water, through a bulkhead, into - 
GENERATOR ROOM - (CONTINUOUS) 
Where the CREWMAN and TWO OPERATORS struggle to CLOSE THE DOOR AGAINST THE WATER. 
SENIOR OPERATOR (on the intercom) We've been hit! We're taking water! 
THE BRIDGE - 
Alarms sound! Red lights flash! 
DAMAGE CONTROL Flooding in the engine room! 
FIRST OFFICER Get me damage reports! Start the pumps! 
SECOND OFFICER (holding out a ship's phone) 
It's the Captain - 
PASSAGEWAY #1 - 
On a phone, outside the ship's GYM, deep in the hull: 
THE CAPTAIN What the hell is going on?!? 
FIRST OFFICER (intercut if necessary) I think we've been holed, sir! 
THE CAPTAIN On my way! 
He speeds along the passageway, going through a water-tight door, slamming it behind him. Meanwhile, on - 
THE BRIDGE - 
HELMSMAN The engines are gone! 
DAMAGE CONTROL Flooding on D deck! 
FIRST OFFICER Sound the general alarm! Seal all compartments! 
As the Second Officer grabs the intercom - 
SECOND OFFICER (into intercom) Attention all hands - 
CREW'S MESS - 
The crew members look up from their meals - 
SECOND OFFICER (continuing) Proceed to emergency stations - 
GENERATOR ROOM - 
The men have closed the door, but... HEAR A HIGH-PITCHED WHINING, GRINDING SOUND from the other side. They exchange a quizzical look; they don't know what to make of it, when: 
BANG! The door explodes inward - and a high-pressured stream of water blasts in, blowing them back against the walls. 
BRIDGE - 
The lights go out! Everyone is scrambling: 
SYSTEMS OFFICER We've lost power! 
FIRST OFFICER Go to back up generators! 
SECOND OFFICER (into intercom) Repeat: Seal all compartments, and - 
CREW'S MESS - 
In the dim lighting - 
SECOND OFFICER (on intercom) Proceed to emergency stations at once! 
The men start to move, but halt at A HUMMING SOUND. They look around: Where is it coming from? 
Suddenly a THREE FOOT SECTION OF THE DECK EXPLODES IN A FOUNTAIN OF WATER. The men are swept off their feet. 
PASSAGEWAY/GANTRY #2 - 
One of the CREWMAN SPOTS SOMETHING IN THE DISTANCE: 
CREWMAN Hey - look! Over there! 
NEW ANGLE - (ROCK OUTCROPPING - STRAIT OF MALACCA - NIGHT) 
The SEA DOLPHIN II emerges from a cove, looking like a ghostly white apparition in the fog. 
RETURN ON THE LIFEBOAT - 
The men yell and wave and whistle, hoping to be saved. 
CLOSER ON THE SEA DOLPHIN II - DECK - 
Elliot Harmsway removes a pair of binoculars from his face. Turns to YUNG, standing next to him at the rail: 
HARMSWAY Lovely night for a shipwreck, isn't it? 
Yung looks at Harmsway like he's crazy. Oblivious, Harmsway looks at his WATCH, then looks through the BINOCULARS again - and begins to WHISTLE the opening notes of My Fair Lady's "WOULDN'T IT BE LOVERLY." ("All I want is a room somewhere, far away from the cold night air") 
THE LIFEBOAT - 
As the men cry for help, the Sonar Operator spots something just below the surface, moving toward the lifeboat at great speed. 
He hears the hum. His eyes follow the churning water... 
And suddenly - out of nowhere - the Worm hits the lifeboat from below, smashing it to bits, hurtling the pieces in the air. 
THE SEA DOLPHIN II - 
Harmsway lowers the binoculars' smiling. Stamper appears, hands Harmsway a piece of paper. 
STAMPER We've decoded their last transmission. 
Harmsway studies it for a moment - smiles. 
HARMSWAY Perfect. They'll be searching miles from here. (then) Time for phase two. You can get the men in the water. 
And with this, Harmsway turns, and walks off, jauntily whistling "Wouldn't It Be Loverly." 
Stamper looks at Yung, re: Harmsway's glee. 
YUNG You heard him. Get the men in the water! 
NEW ANGLE - SIDE OF THE SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT - 
In the water next to the chip, FOUR DIVERS drop the last of their equipment in a DIVE BOAT. They cast off, motoring into the fog. 
EXT. LONDON - RESTAURANT BIBENDUM - NIGHT 
The classic Michelin building on Fulham road. 
INT. RESTAURANT BIBENDUM - 
A YOUNG WOMAN is yammering away at Bond; he's trying to put a good face on what is obviously a dreadful fix-up first date. 
WOMAN I can't believe it took us so long to finally get together! What exactly do you do for the government? 
BOND (after a beat) You might say... 'Public relations.' 
WOMAN How fascinating! I bet you meet all the most fabulous people. 
Before Bond can answer, the MAITRE D' interrupts. 
MAITRE D' Excuse me - Mr. Bond? You have a call. 
Bond excuses himself. 
NEW ANGLE - BOND AT PHONE - 
007 picks up the receiver, without saying hello: 
BOND Moneypenny! You're early. You weren't supposed to call until - (he stiffens) Yes. I understand. Twenty minutes. 
EXT. THE BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT 
Passing a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY TRUCK with an ad for "TOMORROW" ("The Paper that Never Lies,") Bond's DB-5 roars past the guard. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BANK OF LONDON - NIGHT 
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK glares as MINISTER JOHNSTONE enters to address M, TANNER, A TREASURY OFFICIAL, and various UNIFORMS and SUITS. 
MINISTER JOHNSTONE Good evening. I've just spoken with the Prime Minister at the economic summit in Tokyo; he's expecting a full update within the hour. (beat) For those of you still unaware, some forty minutes ago - 
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK (interrupting) Excuse me, but - (all turn to him:) I must formally protest this meeting. Given the nature of what's occurred - and the need for secrecy - I see no reason to involve the air force, the army, or MI-6. (beat, as M and Tanner exchange a look) This is an internal affair that should be handled strictly by the officers of her Majesty's Royal Navy. 
MINISTER JOHNSTONE (furious) Admiral, are you suggesting - 
He's distracted by the CLICK OF A DOOR OPENING. All turn to SEE BOND entering, wearing a FULL NAVAL UNIFORM. M stifles a smile. 
BOND Sorry I'm late - 
M Actually, you're just in time. (she turns to) Admiral Roebuck: You know Commander Bond, don't you? 
ADMIRAL ROEBUCK (deflated) Yes. Of course. 
BOND I've looked forward to meeting you. 
Bond sits. M glances at Johnstone as if to say "proceed." 
MINISTER JOHNSTONE As I was saying: Approximately forty- five minutes ago, we received an abandon ship signal from the H.M.S. Indomitable. (flicks on a map display) Looking at these infrared satellite images - provided by Mr. Tanner of MI-6 -the ship is presumed lost here, just south of Kuala Lumpur, where she broadcast her last position. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STRAIT OF MALACCA - FOG - NIGHT 
Foreground, empty diving boat. Background, Sea Dolphin II, with the "flexible hose" hanging over the rail, down into the water. 
INT. BRIDGE - SEA DOLPHIN II - NIGHT 
Stamper works "worm" master control with a video joystick. 
STAMPER Divers approaching the hull. 
Harmsway and Yung look over his shoulder at: 
INSERT - VIDEO SCREEN - 
Through the worm's UNDERWATER camera, FOUR DIVERS with TORCHES and WELDING TOOLS are about to enter the HOLE in the Indomitable's hull. 
(The video screen also contains lots of digital information about the divers and the worm's functions.) 
NEUTRAL POV - UNDERWATER - EXT. INDOMITABLE 
The worm follows the Divers into the hull. 
WORM POV - INT. ENGINE ROOM - 
It trails the Divers past debris and bodies of crewman. 
SAME SHOT - VIDEO SCREEN - WORM POV - 
EXT. PORT KLANG - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
The Harbor Master's tower overlooks a small armada of yachts, fishing boats, etc. A series of long dockways jut out into the harbor. 
CIGARETTE BOAT - (PORT KLANG - WATERWAY) - DAY 
Wade's boat is moving slowly along the waterway at the end of the docks. Looking off, Bond spots the Harbor Master's Tower: 
BOND Over there. 
Wade turns the boat down one of the dock channels. 
NEW ANGLE - WADE/BOND'S POV - DOCKWAY CHANNEL - 
A SLEEK LAUNCH is ROARING TOWARDS them, on a dead collision course. A WOMAN in a baseball cap is at the wheel. 
WADE pulls his boat to the right; the LAUNCH ROARS AROUND THEM, rocking the cigarette boat with its wake. 
BOTH BOND and WADE clock the woman - who we will later learn is SIDNEY WINCH. Wade stares after her: 
WADE I think I've just seen my next future ex-wife. 
BOND (seeing they're about to crash) Not if you kill us first - unless that's how you plan to leave Muffy. 
Wade scowls, setting the boat back on course. 
DOCKSIDE - PORT KLANG - DAY - 
Bond hops off the boat, securing the lines. Wade joins him. 
WADE By the way, Jimbo - whatever happened to that girl - in Cuba - ? 
Finished tying the boat, they walk toward the Harbor Master's office. 
BOND Natalya? 
WADE Yeah. Russian Minister of Transportation. 
BOND She married a hockey player. 
WADE I envy your 'undercover' assignments. 
BOND (a look, then) We work in the dark. We do what we can. 
INT. HARBOR MASTER OFFICE - PORT KLANG - DAY 
The local Malay harbor master puts a stack of charts on the counter. 
HARBOR MASTER Wind, tide, currents... You're the second person today asked for a full set of charts. (holds out a clipboard) If you'd just sign here - 
Bond takes the clipboard - 
INSERT CLIPBOARD - read signature: SIDNEY WINCH. 
Bond returns the clipboard: 
BOND Thanks. (apparent afterthought) By the way - was there anything strange the night before last? Odd weather, lost boats - ?? 
HARBOR MASTER No... Unless you're talking about the bus problem. 
BOND ...Bus problem? 
HARBOR MASTER Captain Cheong's ferry was late. He runs the line across the Strait between here and Sumatra. The lumber mill workers coming back for the weekend missed the last bus. Slept on the docks. Hundreds of them. 
BOND Thanks. 
EXT. HARBOR MASTER'S TOWER - DAY 
Bond emerges, carrying the charts, along with Wade. 
BOND I have to get these to London. Do you know this Captain Cheong? 
WADE Spends his nights at the Kuala Lumpur yacht club. 
BOND Can you arrange a meeting? 
WADE Hell. The CIA built that club. 
EXT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT 
Palm trees, torch lights, and Rolls Royces. 
INT. KUALA LUMPUR YACHT CLUB - NIGHT 
A local band plays on the verandah. We find Wade at a POKER TABLE with five local Malay Chinese. He CUTS THE CARDS, exuberantly: 
WADE Okay gentlemen. The name of the game is 7-card Cambodian stud. Everything is wild! 
And then - moving through a beaded glass curtain - we find Bond, in a white dinner jacket, sitting with CAPTAIN CHEONG. The Captain is elegant, mid-5O's, eye patch. (To be put into local dialect.) 
CAPTAIN CHEONG In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond. 
BOND I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships. 
CAPTAIN CHEONG Sometimes kill the crew; other times - (points to his eye) Torture them. 
BOND I'm sorry. 
CAPTAIN CHEONG The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem. 
BOND Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver? 
CAPTAIN CHEONG Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong. (chuckles) My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.' 
BOND (smiles, standing to leave) I appreciate your time - 
CAPTAIN CHEONG Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait. 
BOND Where can I find him? 
CAPTAIN CHEONG Him? He, is a she - (points) at the bar. 
NEW ANGLE - THE BAR - 
SIDNEY WINCH, about 32, tough, smart, and (here's a surprise,) beautiful, is ordering a drink when Bond appears: 
SIDNEY Bourbon. Neat. 
BOND I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat. 
Very slowly, Sidney turns to Bond. She looks him up and down - as if deciding whether this specimen is worth her time. Her conclusion: A definite - though skeptical - maybe. She gives him a sultry smile: 
SIDNEY Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless. 
BOND - And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake. 
SIDNEY (thinking, 'not bad') Have we met? 
BOND This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor. (holds out his hand to shake) James Bond. 
SIDNEY Sidney Winch. 
And we're back at the outcropping where the Indomitable sank. The SPORT FISHING BOAT is trolling against a background of sandy beaches and the lush green hills of Sumatra. 
FLYING BRIDGE - 
Wade scans the shore; Bond studies the sonar display. 
WADE I dunno, Jimbo. It can't be out here. How could they get this far off course? 
BOND (concentrating on the sonar) Who knows? Fog, night... 
WADE They'd never sail this close to the shore. 
BOND Wait a minute - (beat, pointing to the screen) I've got it. There! Off the port bow! 
INSERT SONAR SCREEN - 
The murky electronic outline of a ship. 
BACK TO SCENE - 
Bond watches the sonar screen. Wade slows engines, consults charts. 
BOND Cut the engines! It's about two- hundred fifty feet down. 
JUMP CUT TO: 
AN ANCHOR BEING PITCHED INTO THE WATER - (BOW OF SPORT FISHING BOAT) - 
By Wade. Bond is strapping on his scuba tank. 
WADE Two-fifty's pretty deep for air. You should really be using mixed gases. 
Bond glances at the air gauge on his tanks. 
BOND I'll make a bounce dive. If I can keep my bottom time short, I'll be all right. 
Bond gathers up FLARES, and sits on the gunwale. 
BOND (only half teasing) Keep your eye out for pirates. 
Wade pulls back his shirt to reveal TWO SIX-SHOOTERS. 
WADE I got you covered. 
BOND That's reassuring. 
Bond rolls backward into the water and disappears. 
UNDERWATER - 
Bond swims to the anchor line, and begins pulling himself downward, handover-hand, deeper and deeper into a monochromatic gloom. 
UNDERWATER BOTTOM - 
Bond touches down by the anchor; his fins kick up the sandy bottom. Checking his wrist compass, he sets off through a rocky channel. 
EXT. INDOMITABLE - UNDERWATER - 
Ahead, in the dimness, a huge gray shape looms out of the sand. 
Bond lights a FLARE, and the scene is suddenly alive with color. From Bond's position, the hull seems to go on forever before being lost beyond range of his flare. Bond checks his air gauge. 
INSERT GAUGES - 
Depth: 283 feet - Air capacity: 3/4 tank remaining. 
BACK TO SCENE - 
Bond swims to the hole in the side of the Indomitable. He pauses to study the damage. Then enters. 
INT. ENGINE ROOM - UNDERWATER - 
Bond sees the damage on the passageway door. Swims through it. 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - UNDER WATER - 
The flare throws eerie shadows along the corridor; Bond swims to the busted bilge-hold hatch. Again, he pauses to examine the marks made by the worm. He drops into the hold. 
INT. CARGO HOLD - UNDER WATER - 
The gold is gone. Bond swims a few yards in: Nothing. A vast empty space. Bond's flare sputters and dies. He drops it, lights another. 
As he turns to exit, SOMETHING GLINTS on the deck below the hatch. He moves toward it. 
NEW ANGLE - CLOSER - 
A half-chewed GOLD BAR is wedged between a brace and the bulkhead. Bond reaches for it, feeling the worm's drill marks on the gold. 
Just as he yanks the bar out, a MORAY EEL lashes out from behind the brace, baring its teeth. 
Still clutching the gold bar, Bond jumps back, and shoots up, into: 
PASSAGE WAY -(INT. INDOMITABLE) - UNDER WATER - 
where he collides with something floating just below the ceiling. Dropping the flare on the impact, Bond twists around to see: 
THE FACE OF A FLOATING DEAD SAILOR. 
BACK TO SCENE - 
Throwing wildly gyrating shadows, the flare drops to the deck, roll- ing under some debris. Regaining his composure, Bond SLIPS THE GOLD BAR INTO A WEBBED SACK ON HIS BELT, then moves to retrieve the flare. 
CLOSE ON HATCH/DECK - 
Bond reaches for the flare, under a section of the torn hatch cover. He notices the BROKEN URANIUM GRINDING TOOTH. He picks it up, stuffs it into his sack, and swims off. 
CUT TO: 
UNDERWATER BOTTOM - ANCHOR - 
Bond swims to the anchor line, grabs hold, and starts up. On the way, he glances at his gauges: 
INSERT GAUGES - 
Depth: 160 feet - Air capacity: below RED LINE - empty. The ambient light level on the gauges suddenly DARKENS. 
BOND LOOKS UP TO THE SURFACE - 
HIS POV - 
A black HULL has blotted out the light... And SOMETHING LARGE AND HEAVY IS FALLING straight at 007. 
BOND - 
kicks away from the anchor-line just as a 1000 POUND ANCHOR streaks by. He looks up again: 
THREE DIVERS ARE IN THE WATER. 
One carries a strange-looking HARPOON-TYPE GUN; another trails a CABLE. The divers have fanned out, looking for 007. 
BOND - 
But BOND hesitates, LOOKING BACK AT THE TECHNICIAN with the URANIUM. 007 wants to get it, but Taro nudges him out with the gun muzzle. 
EXT. MALACCA STRAIT - DAY 
A BRITISH NAVAL CUTTER is pulling alongside the barge - SEA SIREN WAILING, crew members in battle gear, FORWARD GATLING GUN manned. 
CAPTAIN MORTON (on bullhorn) Attention sea barge: Lay down your weapons, and prepare to be boarded. 
ON THE BARGE - Sidney and Co. stand, weapons ready. 
CAPTAIN MORTON Repeat: Lay down your weapons, and prepare to be boarded. 
Bond turns to Sidney, who's grabbed a bullhorn of her own. 
BOND If I were you - 
SIDNEY - You're not. 
BOND (as she hoists the bullhorn) Just remember: They think there's ten billion dollars in gold down there. 
SIDNEY Thank you. (clicks it on, and:) "Now hear this: Drop dead." 
Bond and Wade exchange an amused/helpless glance - as if they both know what's coming next. There's a pause, then - 
THE CRUISER'S GATLING GUN ERUPTS WITH AN EARDRUM-SHATTERING SALVO. It's only a warning shot, but - 
EVERYONE ON THE BARGE DIVES FOR THE DECK... Except for Bond and Wade, who might as well be having tea. Bond looks down at Taro, cowering on the boards. 
BOND Gatling gun beats Uzi. 
NEW ANGLE - (CUTTER/BARGE) - DAY 
An ARMED BOARDING PARTY is coming across an aluminum bridge that has extended from the Cutter onto the barge. 
CAPTAIN MORTON (a tiny popinjay) Who's in charge here? 
SIDNEY I am. What do you want? 
CAPTAIN MORTON You have precisely one minute to pull up your anchor and be under way. 
SIDNEY Forget it. No way. I got here first. 
CAPTAIN MORTON (ignoring her) Who's Wade? 
WADE That would be me - 
CAPTAIN MORTON (snidely) Thanks for your message. (turns to) And you're Bond? 
BOND Yes - 
CAPTAIN MORTON Guard! Arrest these men! Escort them to the cutter! 
Bond and Wade are stunned. The Marines move in. Bond struggles - 
BOND Wait a minute - 
CAPTAIN MORTON Get them out of here. If he says one word, shoot him. 
As TWO MARINES with automatic rifles take Bond and Wade across the folding bridge - 
SIDNEY (demanding) What's your name? 
CAPTAIN MORTON Captain Morton. 
Pause. She expects him to ask "And yours?" but he doesn't. 
SIDNEY My name is Sidney Winch, and - 
CAPTAIN MORTON Good for you, Miss Winch. You now have exactly 30 seconds to get this rust bucket out of here. 
SIDNEY (furiously) I know my rights. These are international waters. The British Navy abandoned that boat, and I'm claiming it. Under international law, I have the right to salvage what's on that wreck. 
CAPTAIN MORTON Fifteen seconds. Perhaps you should consider hiring an attorney. 
SIDNEY I was an attorney! 
CAPTAIN MORTON Hmmm. I suppose this is a step above that profession. (beat) Ten seconds. Are you leaving? 
SIDNEY No. 
CAPTAIN MORTON You leave me no alternative. 
CAPTAIN MORTON (upholstering a walkie-talkie) Cut her anchor. 
As Sidney yells "NO!" - THE FORWARD GATLING GUN erupts to life. One short, bone rattling burst CUTS THE CHAIN. 
SIDNEY You won't get away with this! 
CAPTAIN MORTON (stepping onto the bridge) Good-day, Miss Winch. I advise you to get some steam up - before you run aground. 
As she floats away, Sidney calls out to the Captain, Bond and Wade: 
SIDNEY You bastards! Believe me - you haven't heard the last of me! 
EXT. DECK - THE CUTTER - DAY - 
Bond, Wade and the Captain. 
WADE - Nice trick with the arrest. Very convincing. 
CAPTAIN MORTON It's no trick, Mr. Wade. I've got half a mind to throw both of you in the brig. 
BOND Don't you think you're overreacting? 
CAPTAIN MORTON (with great sarcasm) Yes. The famous James Bond. I've heard all about you, sir. You were under direct orders to act as an observer - and yet you had to go off, on your own, like some half-assed CIA cowboy - (Wade reacts) Endangering the gold, attracting that lunatic woman, and then putting in a distress call for us to save your bloody hide. 
BOND (Calmly) ...That's all well and good, Captain, save for one thing: (beat) There's no gold down there. 
CAPTAIN MORTON What are you talking about? We went through all this and the ship isn't even down there? 
BOND Yes, the ship is down there. But the gold is gone. 
CAPTAIN MORTON That's absurd! It took two squads of forty men fifteen days to load that gold. 
BOND I know what I saw - 
CAPTAIN I don't care what you think you saw. You're a damned amateur. (beat) Just get off my ship. Go back to your trench-coats and your code names - and leave the job to professionals. 
BOND (exchanges a glance with Wade, then) Aye-aye, Captain. 
EXT. SPORT FISHING BOAT - STRAIT OF MALACCA - DAY - 
As Bond and Wade push away from the Naval Cutter: 
WADE Where to now, Jimbo? 
BOND (thinking) I'm not certain... But I think there's someone I want to press for some answers in Kuala Lumpur. 
EXT. COASTAL ROADWAY - MALAYSIA - (BOND CAR) - DAY - 
Bond'- car travels through the tropical landscape, turning at a sign for Kuala Lumpur. 
INT. ELEVATOR - 
The doors close. Bond clocks the security camera in the ceiling. Harmsway is about to take great delight in making Bond squirm: 
HARMSWAY Before I became involved with Paris, she was always involved with the most inappropriate' men... (beat) Playboys. Thrill seekers. Middle aged Peter Pans who only brought out the worst in her. 
BOND I see. 
HARMSWAY I tried to save her. But she remained a manic depressive: Fits, inappropriate behavior... Delusions of grandeur. 
BOND I wonder if it runs in the family. 
HARMSWAY (bursts out in a laugh) The only difference between a psychopath and a genius, Mr. Bond, is the degree of success. 
He looks up at the digital readout, going from 40 to 50. 
HARMSWAY Still, I do miss her. I only wish she could have lived to see all this. 
BOND I can feel your pain. 
The doors open: 
HARMSWAY By the way - what is it that brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mister Bond? 
BOND Sightseeing. 
Harmsway motions for Bond to exit. They step out into: 
INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY ("ROGUES GALLERY") - LATE AFTERNOON 
A short hallway lined with OIL PORTRAITS of Harmsway's ancestors. Double doors at both ends. (People passing through.) As they walk - 
HARMSWAY I call this the Rogue's gallery. 
BOND Yes. I can see: You've hung the rest of your relatives. 
HARMSWAY (pointing to the first portrait) My third great Uncle - the Earl of Aberdeen - negotiated the purchase of Hong Kong from the Chinese. (moving to) His son-in-law - George Harmsway - made the first family fortune, running opium into Shanghai... (moving to) His son, Thomas, who lost it, smoking the opium... And my grandfather Henry, who opened the first telegraph station, and published the colony's first English newspaper. (pausing, wistfully) It was a city of unlimited possibility. 
BOND So why did you leave? 
HARMSWAY Because it's a dying city. Since the Chinese take-over, who knows what can happen tomorrow? (moving to the last two portraits) In any case, this is my father, Charles: A royal bastard who started the first radio and television stations. Said I'd never amount to anything, but... (passing his own portrait) I turned it into this 
He pushes through a door, into: 
INT. HNN NEWS CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON - 
A cavernous THREE STORY ROOM bristling with activity. At the center is the main HNN ANCHOR DESK, (where a news broadcast is in progress,) surrounded by scores of reporter's desks a la CNN. 
Around the perimeter of the room are VARIOUS TV STUDIOS looking out on Kuala Lumpur. All are broadcasting: A Larry King-type chat show; MTV; SPORTS; a KITCHEN where a chef is preparing something flambeed. 
With its walls of monitors, equipment, and control rooms, the effect is overwhelming. Harmsway will walk Bond around the perimeter: 
HARMSWAY Welcome to the new world order, Mr. Bond. (starting to walk) Churchill had his armies; Caesar had his legions; I have my divisions: (pointing) News, sports, business, entertainment. And these are my foot soldiers: (a wave of his hand) 2000 people working on 14 floors to feed 300 newspapers, 4 cable news networks, 87 magazines, and 29 different cable TV channels - in 35 languages. 
BOND And still not a thing to watch. 
He glances at the SATELLITE CONTROL ROOM, with a NASA-type WORLD MAP. 
BOND ...Although it must be fun to have all those satellites. 
HARMSWAY They're merely tools to disseminate information. 
BOND (wryly) Or disinformation... If you wanted to, say, beam down a signal to send a ship off course? Maybe one degree a minute? 
HARMSWAY (guffaws) Fantastic idea Mr. Bond! Perhaps I should buy it for a book! It's totally preposterous, but - (off Bond's reaction) You amuse me. ...And now perhaps I can amuse you. 
He stops at a VIDEO TERMINAL. Begins to type. 
HARMSWAY Let's see... First we have this James Bond... I believe he's a field adjuster for Lloyd's of London... 
INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S MI-6 COVER - 
HARMSWAY Then we have this James Bond. 
INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S KGB FILE - 
HARMSWAY (reading from the screen) ... Licensed to Kill... (aside) Not a bad title for that book... (then) Or perhaps you'd prefer this James Bond - 
INSERT VIDEO SCREEN - BOND'S CHINESE FILE - 
HARMSWAY Who I believe they call "007." 
Bond is not amused. Harmsway is enjoying himself: 
HARMSWAY You see, Mr. Bond, you and I are both men of action. But your era is passing. Words are the new weapons; satellites the new artillery. And make no mistake about it: In the right hands, they can be as deadly as your Walther PPK. 
BOND ...Words to live by? 
HARMSWAY Your choice. (glancing at his watch) Look at the time! Come. There's someone I want you meet - about a story I'm thinking of publishing. 
As they leave, Bond is frustrated by Harmsway's "I don't care what you think you know - I can crush you" attitude... And now, Harmsway plans (and the operative word here is plans,) to use Bond, to tie off the one other loose thread in his perfect crime: 
INT. HARMSWAY'S OFFICE - 
The DOOR opens and Harmsway enters, followed by Bond. He calls to someone we don't see: 
HARMSWAY Hello, dear. I'm sorry I took so long - 
REVEAL: SIDNEY is sitting across from his desk. 
SIDNEY That's okay, Uncle Ell - 
She freezes in mid-sentence, seeing Bond. Bond is equally surprised. 
SIDNEY What is HE doing here? 
HARMSWAY I see you two have met. 
BOND Briefly. 
HARMSWAY (crossing to his desk) Don't pout, Sidney. I invited him here hoping he might shed some light on your story. He's from 'Lloyd's of London.' (sly glance to Bond) ...Aren't you, Mr. Bond? 
SIDNEY He's not going to tell the truth! He was diving for the gold! 
Harmsway sits, and addresses Bond, matter-of-factly: 
HARMSWAY It seems - Mr. Bond - that Miss Winch has told me the most incredible story: A sunken British warship filled with gold; a British cutter firing on her; billions of dollars in bullion lying on the bottom of the Strait. 
Bond isn't enjoying this charade. 
HARMSWAY Obviously, the British government denies all of this - 
SIDNEY - I told you! He was there! - 
HARMSWAY - But as I've explained to Sidney, without proof, there's just no story. Don't you agree Mr. Bond? 
Before Bond can answer - 
SIDNEY But I have proof! You ran out of here so fast, I didn't get to show you. 
Bond and Harmsway react - with entirely different concerns: Harmsway wasn't expecting her to have proof; Bond knows that if she shows him the gold, (or worse, the uranium tooth,) Harmsway will probably kill both of them to destroy the evidence, and witnesses. 
BOND SWINGS DOWN OUT OF THE ESCAPE PANEL (like an athlete on a high- bar) FEET FIRST - barely clearing Sidney's head as he KICKS Stamper and the Guard in their faces. They go flying backwards. 
Bond jumps down, grabs Sidney - 
BOND Need a lift? 
And boosts her into the escape panel, following her up. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE THE ELEVATOR - (CONTINUOUS) - 
Bond and Sidney rush forward to the front wall as - 
STAMPER AND THE GUARD - 
Recover, grab their guns, move to the threshold, and START RAKING THE CEILING WITH GUNFIRE. 
ELEVATOR SHAFT - 
Bond presses his body against Sidney, on the front wall, trying to SHIELD HER as BULLETS RIP UP THE FLOOR behind them. With his free hand, Bond reaches up for the LATCH to open the door above them. 
INT. ELEVATOR - 
Stamper stops shooting. Moves to the rear of the cab, under the escape panel. Peers up. Sees nothing. Turns to the Guard: 
STAMPER Help me up. 
ELEVATOR SHAFT - 
Stamper's head pokes up through the hole just as Bond and Sidney have disappeared into - 
INT. HALLWAY - (ELEVATOR BANK) - 71ST FLOOR. 
Squeezing out from between the elevator doors, (which immediately close behind them,) Bond and Sidney encounter a group of STUNNED OFFICE WORKERS, waiting for the elevator. 
BOND (to the office workers) ... I'd try the stairs. 
As Bond and Sidney scamper off - 
RETURN ON STAMPER - IN THE ELEVATOR - 
STAMPER (rushing out) The stairs! (barking into his RADIO) Attention all units! They're on the 71st floor! 
INT. ELEGANT HALLWAY - ANOTHER PART OF THE BUILDING - 
Harmsway is striding towards the SECURITY CENTER, RADIO in hand: 
HARMSWAY Stamper! They're not to leave this building alive! 
BOND AND SIDNEY - (INT. HALLWAY) - 
Moving cautiously toward a CORNER of ANOTHER HALLWAY. 
SIDNEY This has got to be a mistake. 
BOND The only mistake is that they didn't kill us in the elevator. 
At the corner, Bond STOPS, SEEING A GUARD, farther down the hall (his back to them) CHECKING DOORS. 
BOND Wait here. 
SIDNEY No. I'm going with you. 
Bond frowns, but doesn't have the time to argue. They start doing a "DUCK AND COVER" in and out of doorways TO SNEAK UP ON HIM. 
INT. SECURITY CENTER - 
Harmsway bursts in on GUARDS watching a WALL OF SECURITY MONITORS. 
HARMSWAY Where are they? 
GUARD #1 I don't see them - (scanning the monitors) There! 
INSERT VIDEO MONITOR - (SURVEILLANCE SHOT OF HALLWAY) - 
Bond and Sidney have just come into frame, sneaking up on the GUARD. 
HARMSWAY (OVER) Warn him! 
CLOSE ON THE GUARD - (INT. HALLWAY) - 
VOICE ON RADIO Porter! They're behind you - 
GUARD (lifting the radio to reply) Roger! Over and - 
BAM. BOND DECKS HIM. 
BOND Out. 
Bond kneels, grabs the GUARD'S MACHINE PISTOL, and CLIPS, just as - 
SIDNEY JAMES! 
TWO GUARDS have entered from a STAIRCASE DOOR, hoisting MAC-10's. In an instant: (1) Bond lets go a BURST. (2) The Guards SHOOT back, diving for cover in the staircase door. (3) Bond rolls, (4) Pushes Sidney into an open DOORWAY, and (5) returns A BURST, from - 
INT. SMALL KITCHEN/COPIER ROOM - 
Sidney is shaken. As Bond stands in the doorway, guarding them - 
SIDNEY Okay. So it wasn't a mistake. (Bond lets go a blast) What do we do now? Offer them dinner?!?! 
Bond glances back at the KITCHEN SUPPLIES. GETS AN IDEA. He sud- denly TWISTS, SMASHING the BUTT OF HIS GUN down on some GLASSWARE on the counter, then TWISTS BACK, returning a BURST OF GUNFIRE. 
BOND Come here. You shoot. I'll cook. 
She thinks he's nuts, but squeezes next to him. Handing her the gun: 
BOND Aim that way. 
Sidney scowls - as Bond moves off-camera - when suddenly, BULLET HITS RIP UP THE DOOR FRAME. She jumps, TERRIFIED. 
Bond looks at her from the PHOTO-COPYING MACHINE, where he is YANKING OUT the TONER CARTRIDGE. He offers a simple piece of advice: 
BOND Shoot back! 
Sidney frowns... Turns... And as she LETS THE GUN RIP, we cut to: 
INT. STAIRWELL - (ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING) - 
Stamper, running up steps with the guard. They exit into: 
A SHORT SERVICE HALLWAY - 71ST. FLOOR - 
They rush though it, bursting through a door into: 
THE ELEVATOR BANK HALLWAY - 
Stamper and the Guard start hunting Bond. 
RETURN ON SIDNEY (HALLWAY/KITCHEN) - 
As she continues to exchange fire with the guards... 
STAMPER No. Get the fire ax. 
One of the guards grabs it from inside a FIRE CABINET. He hands the AX to Stamper, who takes the first SWING AT THE DOOR. 
RETURN ON BOND - TERRACE SET-BACK - EXT. 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT - 
Bond is positioning the window washer rig. He explains: 
BOND We'll go down close to the sky bridge. We may be able to swing over and use it for cover. 
As Bond climbs into the bucket, Sidney peers over the side. 
SIDNEY No way. I sail. I do not fly. 
BANG! Behind them, Stamper's AX HAS JUST PENETRATED THE DOOR. 
BOND ... Sometimes, you just have to take the plunge. 
Bond yanks her in, flips switches on the control pod, and starts down, as fast as they can go. 
EXT. HARMSWAY TOWERS - AERIAL - 
Bond and Sidney descend. Tiny specs against the sunset. 
INT. STAIRCASE - 
Stamper gives the last few chops to the door. He kicks it open. 
EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - 
Stamper and the guards rush to the ledge. 
BOND AND SIDNEY - DESCENDING ON THE RIG - 60TH FLOOR - 
Bond, looking up - for Stamper - and down - to check their progress. 
SIDNEY All I know is one thing: If we get out of here alive, that gold is mine. (beat) I've earned it. 
Looking upward, Bond SEES STAMPER peering over the rail. BOND FIRES. 
BOND One thing at a time. 
EXT. TERRACE SET-BACK - TWILIGHT - 
Stamper jumps back from the ledge, enraged. Ax in hand, he moves to the WINDOW WASHING RIG'S MACHINERY - 
And takes a roundhouse swing at the UNSPOOLING CABLE - but instead of cutting it, the ax BOUNCES OFF, and the RIG SLIDES ON ITS TRACKS. 
THE RIG - (STILL DESCENDING) - 
Swings! Sidney SCREAMS - almost falling out. Bond grabs her. They are now 5 STORIES DIRECTLY ABOVE THE SKY BRIDGE, swaying like a giant pendulum - although still descending. 
RETURN ON STAMPER - TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT - 
Having failed at the cable, Stamper goes at the PULLEY feeding it. He swings. Swings again. With each blow, the pulley shaft weakens. 
BOND AND SIDNEY - (WINDOW WASHER'S RIG) - 
Dropping in VIOLENT SPURTS - just trying to stay in the damn bucket. 
STAMPER - WIELDING THE AX - 
Finally, the pulley shaft SHATTERS. THE CABLE GRINDS TO A HALT. 
BOND AND SIDNEY - 
are stopped about 20 feet above the sky bridge. 
SIDNEY (panicked, anxious, fast) What now? And don't give me some movie cliché like 'trust me.' 
BOND (what the hell) Trust me. 
And with this, he turns, and SHOOTS OUT the adjacent WINDOW. 
BOND Let's go - 
But as he starts to climb out - SIDNEY SCREAMS! THE CABLE SUDDENLY DROPS THEM 10 FEET LOWER, BELOW THE WINDOW. 
THE TERRACE SET-BACK - 
Stamper whacks away at the side of the cable drum. It's coming loose from its moorings. 
BOND AND SIDNEY - 
look down at the curved glass top of the sky bridge - facing what (she thinks) is certain death: 
SIDNEY We're going to bounce off that thing! 
Bond looks up - assuming they have only seconds left before Stamper cuts the cable. HE GRABS HER: 
BOND Hold on! 
TERRACE SET-BACK - 72ND FLOOR - TWILIGHT - 
Stamper takes a final swing at the cable drum. With a GREAT CLAT- TERING SOUND it SNAPS FREE OF THE MOORINGS, smashes into the wall, and the whole mechanism CAREENS OVER THE SIDE OF THE BUILDING. 
THE WINDOW WASHER'S RIG - 
Bond and Sidney feel the cable give way. They start to free-fall. 
BOND - FIRES HIS MACHINE PISTOL at the glass top of the sky bridge. 
THE BULLETS SHATTER THE GLASS - 
BOND AND SIDNEY CRASH THROUGH, INTO - 
INT. 50TH FLOOR SKY BRIDGE - 
Landing on the deck of the bridge. Bond rolls to his feet as - 
Fifty stories of cable from above is falling onto the deck. Bond yanks Sidney to the side of the building, just as THE CABLE DRUM, PULLEY, AND THE REST OF THE MECHANICS CRASH ON THE WALK-WAY. 
72ND FLOOR TERRACE SET-BACK - 
Looking down, Stamper flips open his radio. 
STAMPER (over radio) They're on the bridge. Seal off the 50th floor! 
INT. SECURITY CENTER - 
HARMSWAY (looking at the monitors) I should have hired this man. (to his guards) Get somebody up there! 
INT. SKY BRIDGE - TWILIGHT - 
Bond is moving to the window washer rig debris. 
SIDNEY What about the elevators? 
He steps to the side of the bridge, and looks at the railings: Four inch pipe. Bond begins to work feverishly: 
BOND We tried that already. Remember? 
YUNG (to the half-dozen engineers) I'm sorry to interrupt again. But we need one more picture for the story. 
The engineers ad-lib replies: "Sure." "Okay." Yung smiles: 
YUNG (CONT'D) Why don't you line up against the wall? Let's make it a group shot. 
The engineers line up against a wall. The cameramen take positions for a massacre. And at the first sound of gunfire, we cut to: 
EXT. ENTRANCEWAY - 
Stamper is marching Bond and Sidney through the door in handcuffs. 
BOND Sleep well? 
SIDNEY Next time, I do the driving. 
Bond gives her a look. 
RETURN ON THE CONTROL ROOM - 
Harmsway and Yung are locking down at the VIDEO SCREEN of a portable version of the "worm" controller we saw on the SEA DOLPHIN II. 
YUNG The drill is in the water; approaching the intake tunnel. 
HARMSWAY Excellent. 
Harmsway looks up, hearing: 
BOND I see you're in your natural element, Harmsway: A room filled with lethal power... (beat) ...With a toxic core at its center. 
Harmsway smiles at Bond and Sidney, who have entered (handcuffed, at gun point,) with Stamper and a guard. Harmsway is charming as ever: 
HARMSWAY Do come in Mr. Bond, Sidney... You're just in time for a nuclear meltdown! 
Coming closer, Sidney struggles against her cuffs, swinging at him - 
SIDNEY You bastard - 
Stamper restrains her, while Bond scans the room for an advantage. He sees a MACHINE PISTOL on the console. 
HARMSWAY Please, Sidney. I'd like to remember you fondly. 
YUNG (calling from the console) Approaching the first gate. 
HARMSWAY Start the grinders. 
UNDERWATER - POWER PLANT INTAKE TUNNEL - 
The "worm" is nearing an iron sluice gate; the eye closes, the grinders rev, and it starts to eat through the bars. 
RETURN ON CONTROL ROOM - 
BOND ...So that's what the weapons grade uranium was for. 
HARMSWAY Precisely, Mr. Bond. In a matter of minutes, the boring device will arrive at the core of the reactor... (beat) And when the radioactive blades cut into the plutonium - 
BOND - Instant melt-down. 
HARMSWAY Chernobyl will look like a campfire. 
Young calls out again, with a hint of urgency. Bond decides to try rattling Harmsway - so he can move Closer to the gun, unnoticed. 
YUNG We're through the first gate. Approaching the second - 
BOND (demanding) Why, Harmsway? Wasn't stealing the gold enough? 
HARMSWAY (to Yung) Bore through. (to Bond, chuckling) ...They used to say living well was the best revenge, Mr. Bond. (beat) They're wrong. (beat) Revenge is the best revenge. 
YUNG Entering the main tunnel - ten minutes to target - 
BOND (fiercely) What could you possibly have to be vengeful for, Harmsway? Still trying to prove yourself to daddy? 
This infuriates Harmsway. Bond moves closer to the gun. 
HARMSWAY Hong Kong, Mr. Bond! 
YUNG You have to leave - 
HARMSWAY (enraged, ignoring Yung) A hundred and fifty years ago, my ancestors took this island - a barren, lifeless rock - and turned it into the greatest city known to modern civilization. (beat) And now that I'm being forced to give it back, I intend to return it in exactly the same condition: A barren, lifeless rock. (beat) The gold is merely reparations - payment from the spineless British government who wouldn't listen. 
BOND (to Sidney, glancing at the gun) ... I think Uncle Elliot is having his own melt-down. 
YUNG Approaching the third gate - 
HARMSWAY Smash through it! (then) Laugh all you'd like, Mr. Bond - but you fit perfectly in to my plans. (he reaches for a newspaper) Here. This just in. Newsflash. Read all about it. 
He thrusts an issue of TOMORROW at Bond, holding the top half out as Bond reads THE HEADLINES, sourly: 
BOND ... Hong Kong destroyed by nuclear meltdown... British agent found in reactor suspected of sabotage; Harmsway calls for British government to resign. 
Harmsway smiles at Bond: 
HARMSWAY ...As the advertising says: Tomorrow never lies. 
BOND What about the gold? 
YUNG You must go. Now. Otherwise the boat won't be out of range - 
Stamper and the guard appear nervous, itching to leave - 
HARMSWAY Thirty seconds. (then, to Bond) That's the most brilliant part of the plan, Mr. Bond: To save the economy, I'll let the new British government - my British government - announce that the gold was irradiated in Hong Kong - where no one will be able to touch it for a hundred years. (beat) And just by coincidence: 
He turns the paper over and reads/reveals a smaller headline: 
HARMSWAY ...Gold mine opens in Vietnam. (turns to Stamper) Let's go. Put them in the airlock. 
Stamper moves towards Bond and Sidney. Bond edges closer to the gun. 
BOND You'll never get away with it, Harmsway. Too many people know. 
Bond tenses, ready to spring - 
HARMSWAY Who, Mr. Bond? The kooks - the crazies - the conspiracy theorists? The Oliver Stones of the world? (pausing, then, with great scorn:) I'll publish their books, I'll make their movies, I'll put them on my TV shows! (beat) They're my bellboys. They carry my luggage. 
Bond moves, but - the guard picks up the gun!!! Bond frowns. 
HARMSWAY Now. Get them in the airlock. 
Fortunately, Bond has a back-up plan. As Stamper hustles them off - 
BOND One problem, Harmsway: The girl. And the handcuffs. They'll give it away. 
Harmsway considers this for a second. Sidney takes Bond's arm. 
SIDNEY No. I want to stay with him. 
Bond looks at her. He's surprised: In the blink of an eye, he realizes he's developed feelings for her. He knows that if he could hold her, he'd kiss her, and whisper "You're a hell of a girl"... 
But at the same instant - throwing a glance at Yung - he knows he's running out of time against the worm, and is better off alone. 
HARMSWAY (breaking the moment, cynically) How sweet. 
INT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT - 
Sidney looks up, hearing and feeling the explosion. 
INT. BRIDGE - 
Harmsway regains control of the boat; he TAKES A GUN from the dead captain, and pushes the body out. 
EXT. PASSAGEWAY - 
With FLAMING DEBRIS still falling around him, Bond is stealthily moving down a passageway toward the front of the ship. 
(Bond has two goals in mind at this point: First, to neutralize any threats, and second, to save Sidney if she's still alive.) 
Arriving at a BULKHEAD DOOR, Bond checks both directions down the passageway, then pokes his head inside - 
And is SUDDENLY YANKED BACKWARDS, OUT INTO THE PASSAGEWAY, thrown against a railing. 
Bond looks up: 
STAMPER stands with a smile on his face. One arm is raised above his head, grasping the WORM on the swinging boom. The worm is attached to the boom by a thin metal cable. 
STAMPER You're mine now. 
Bond rushes at Stamper, slamming into him. The man doesn't flinch. With his free hand, he grabs Bond by his shirt, and throws him against a steel wall. Bond crashes to the deck. 
As Bond recovers, Stamper (still smiling) presses a RED BUTTON on a wall, and THE WORM comes to life. 
Stamper closes in on Bond with the worm. 
Bond tries to stand, but Stamper flings him back down, pinning Bond against the wall with his free hand as he - 
MANEUVERS THE WORM TOWARDS BOND'S HEAD. 
With the cutting blades whirring inches away from Bond's nose - 
STAMPER I'm going to do this slowly - 
Bond executes a scissor kick to Stamper's ankles. Stamper tumbles sideways. Bond rolls away from the worm - 
But by the time Bond gets to his feet, Stamper has recovered, and is rushing at Bond full force, with the worm. 
Stamper thrusts the worm at Bond once. Bond ducks. The worm chews into the wall. 
Pulling the device back, Stamper thrusts a second time - (same action,) then a third (same action) - still missing Bond. 
INSERT - CLOSE ON THE CABLE SPOOL/CABLE - 
With all the yanking and pulling, a loop of slack has developed in the cable, on the ground. 
RETURN TO SCENE - 
Stamper is about to attack Bond a fourth time when Bond kicks him in the groin. Stamper doubles over in pain - 
And the worm FLIES OUT OF HIS HAND, swinging on the boom OVER THE SIDE OF THE SHIP. 
UNDERWATER - 
The grinders propel the worm forward, into the hull. 
SIDNEY - (INT. STORAGE ROOM) - 
Hears a strange vibrating sound from the wall. 
HARMSWAY - (INT. BRIDGE) - 
HARMSWAY (barking into the radio) Stamper! Report in! 
EXT. DECK/PASSAGEWAY - 
As Stamper straightens up, winded from the groin kick - 
HARMSWAY'S VOICE (continuing, on Stamper's radio) Report to the bridge! 
BOND rushes to A SMALL PILE OF SLACK CABLE, which is rapidly growing taught as the worm wends its way underwater. 
Stamper rushes Bond - 
And in one lightening fast move, Bond wraps the cable twice around Stamper's neck. 
Suddenly THE CABLE TIGHTENS, and - 
STAMPER soars 15 in the air, HANGING BY HIS NECK, as -

THE WORM BURSTS THROUGH THE WALL! A torrent of water floods in, pushing Sidney off to one side.

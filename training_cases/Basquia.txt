BLACK 
We HEAR "Waltzing Matilde," by Tom Waits. 
INT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART - DAY (DREAM SEQUENCE IN GRAINY BLACK AND WHITE) 
Fade out music. 
Silence. 
A well-dressed black BOY and his MOTHER walk through several galleries. 
They stand before Picasso's "Guernica," holding hands. 
The mother is disturbed. Crying. 
The boy looks up, confused and frightened, concerned to see his mother crying in public. She looks at him tenderly. 
Her brow furrows. She stops crying. She stares just above his eyes. 
Something's happening: she looks with wonder at the top of his head... his eyes roll upward, trying to see - it's a crown! 
He raises his hands. He touches it. 
A beam of light illuminates the crown, casting its glow on his mother's face. 
The beam gets whiter, the rest of the screen gets black. 
INT. CARDBOARD BOX 
Silence. In darkness, we hear a VOICE - imbued with a sense of its own history: 
VOICE (O.S.) Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh boat. There's no trip so horrible that someone won't take it. The idea of the unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret is a deliciously foolish one. We must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh for really sending this myth into orbit. How many pictures did he sell? One? He couldn't give them away. We are so ashamed of his life that the rest of art history will be retribution for Van Gogh's neglect. No one wants to be part of a generation that ignores another Van Gogh. 
The beam of light shines through a small hole. It falls upon a sleeping, dreaming, delighted face. It belongs to JEAN MICHEL BASQUIAT. 
OUTDOOR, DAYTIME SOUNDS filter in. 
Hearing the voice, Jean frowns at being woken up. 
EXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAY 
A long, rectangular cardboard box. 
SUPER: "NEW YORK CITY" 
ANGLE ON: 
RENE RICARD (early 30's), seated at a park bench, hunched over a notebook. He's a raggedy dandy: A poet in a hooded sweatshirt and white hightops. 
As he writes, he reads aloud, as if addressing Posterity. 
RENE (CONT'D) (sighing theatrically) In this town one is at the mercy of the recognition factor. One's public appearance is absolute. 
Beyond him, a HAND gropes its way out of the box. It tosses a can of YOOHOO chocolate drink. 
RENE (CONT'D) I consider myself a metaphor of the public. I am a public eye. I am a witness. 
A HEAD appears from the box. It's Jean's. 
Jean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day. The urban park around him is alive with a typically full range of the good and bad in life. He eases himself out of the oversize box in which he has spent the night. There's something about the way that he stands while waking up that suggests he's almost surprised at his own body, the adultness of his limbs - just a subtle hint of him coming out of a dream. 
He squints in the sunlight. He has a soft, gentle, Haitian face. His hair is pulled tight to his head. He wears two pairs of blue jeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint-covered Wesleyan University T-shirt, and the inside lining of an overcoat. His appearance is unruly, but it's deliberate. He's stylish. 
He shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: a small book of Pontormo drawings, a can of black spray paint. and a cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking tape. 
Jean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the sky: 
SUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY - STOCK FOOTAGE OF A HAWAIIAN SURFER 
Jean sees the surfer, 'riding the nose' in glistening, shimmering 
sunlight. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAY 
Rene grabs the box for use as a desk and continues to speak out loud as he writes. 
RENE (CONT'D, O.S.) Part of the artist's job is to get the work where I will see it. 
EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE ST. - DAY 
BASQUIAT (under his breath) Who's that? 
BENNY The Devil, man. Rene Ricard. Art critic - writes for Artforum. People read him. Tell him who you are.. 
BASQUIAT Who am I? 
BENNY SAMO. 
BASQUIAT Oh yeah.. 
Rene lands at the counter. 
Jean's gaze is still on Gina. 
She waits on a MAN at a nearby table. 
CUSTOMER How's the special today? 
GINA It's your stomach. 
She hurries past Jean. 
BASQUIAT Hey. 
She slows down, not wanting to. 
BASQUIAT (CONT'D) What do you think? 
She looks at her portrait in the syrup... She can't resist smiling. 
GINA It's me. I've never been done in maple syrup. Here's a rag. 
Gina smiles. She offers him one. As she holds it out, their eyes lock. She tries to resist his smile. 
BASQUIAT (gently) Gina? 
She puts her finger in the syrup and licks it off. 
Benny takes it all in. 
Leshko is upon them. 
LESHKO Alright. Look at you, staring at this girl, making a mess. 
He waves Jean toward the door. 
Jean takes Gina's rag and begins cleaning his mess, seemingly compliant. 
BASQUIAT How about those pancakes? 
He brings out a roll of dimes to the tabletop and splits it open. Dimes roll all over the table and stick in the syrupy parts. The manager explodes. 
LESHKO OK! Goodbye! 
GINA Pipe down, Lech. Let him order. 
LESHKO You nuts? Let him order? You on his side? You're not such a good waitress. You get out, too. 
GINA I just don't think you're being fair. 
LESHKO I need this? 
GINA I need this? 
Gina quietly removes her apron in disbelief. 
Benny gets up to leave very casually. 
BENNY (waving g'bye to Jean) Willie Mays. 
LESHKO (to Gina) That's right. You go with them. Make babies 
the government has to pay for. 
CUT TO: 
GINA AND JEAN 
Leave the restaurant. 
Behind them, we see Rene, absorbed in his writing. 
EXT. AVE. A - DAY 
BASQUIAT Hey, mom. 
She smiles slightly. 
Jean takes a cookie. She does likewise. 
They eat in silence, looking at each other, communicating what they can. 
Time passes. In between cookies her fingers find and break the stems of the pillow feathers. 
BASQUIAT (CONT'D) I met the girl I'm gonna marry. 
His mother brightens. She drinks the milk. They finish the cookies. 
MATILDE Do you like it here? 
BASQUIAT I'd like it better in Hawaii. 
INT. CARDBOARD BOX - NIGHT 
Jean tries to sleep in the box. RAIN falls heavily onto it. 
Drops of water hit his face. 
He wills it to stop. It doesn't. 
Finally, he can't stand it. Rain forces his blinking eyes open. 
INT. BENNY'S APARTMENT -     NIGHT 
A door opens to reveal Jean's wet face. 
Benny lets him in. 
Jean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musical instruments, beer cans, and homemade art. There's a couch with a sheet over it. 
Junk is piled in a corner - mostly art books and drawings. 
Benny sits down at an electric piano, which he's evidently playing. He sings along, softly, working out the words, concentrating, absorbed. 
Jean sets his belongings on the couch, walks to a mic stand and starts making up his own words. 
BASQUIAT "She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby! 
BENNY Would you shut the fuck up? You hear what I'm doing? 
BASQUIAT Yeah man. I'm jealous. You're always great, Benny. (goes back into 'act') "Her name is G-I-N-A Gina And she lo-oooves me." I did say chicken! 
Benny turns off the piano and lights a roach, angry at Jean's self-centeredness. 
Jean digs through a pile of garbage. Finally, he finds what he's looking for - a pile of "SAMO baseball cards" - color Xeroxes of his favorite images and words. He pockets them. 
BASQUIAT (CONT'D) I knew I left these somewhere. One of these'll send your kids to college someday. (hands it to Benny solemnly) Here - I made this for you. 
BENNY Thanks. (beat) Your dad called again - something about a job. 
He hands Jean a slip of paper. He notices the number on Jean's pants. 
BENNY (CONT'D) You got a date already? 
BASQUIAT (exhaling) We're getting married. She said she could tell I was a great artist - she could see it in my eyes. She said she wanted to be by my side and have inter-racial babies with me. 
Benny grins. He grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on his 
index finger. 
BENNY G'night... See you in court tomorrow. 
Jean turns on the TV. He notices the roach. He picks up the paper Benny gave him with the message from his father and sets it on fire. 
He lights the roach with it. 
He looks up; on television, we see a BUM being interviewed. Jean turns up the volume. 
The bum's on the ground, looking beat up. Jean picks up a pocket recorder and turns it on: 
BUM The guy just hit me and I was on the ground!!!! Boom, for real. 
Jean mutes the sound on the TV. He rewinds and proudly plays back the words "Boom, for real." 
He picks up the phone and dials. He turns on the speakerphone. 
Jean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers the phone. (Jean walks in and out of frame throughout the following.) 
It's raining heavily. Jean motions for Gina to wait under the entrance. He tries to hail a cab... And another. And another. 
A parade of them passes, but each time they slow down, they get a glimpse of Jean and drive off. 
Finally, Gina steps out of the entrance. She raises her hand, and a car pulls over instantly. 
INT. CAB - NIGHT 
They scurry into the backseat. 
The cab pulls off. 
EXT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Through a steamy, rain-wet window, we see Jean and Gina seated at a table, dining. 
They seem to be having a nice time. 
INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING 
Gina lays in bed. Daylight streams into the apartment. Jackhammers RATTLE outside. (Music: REGGAE SONG - Errol Scorcher's "Cockroach in de Corner.") 
EXTREME CLOSEUP 
A cockroach crawls from Gina's bedroom across the floor and into the kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on a drawing. It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box. 
Jean rummages through a cabinet. He finds a can of bugspray. Jean tears off a side of the box. With cardboard in one hand and bugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach. 
He's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can. 
Someone POUNDS furiously at the door. 
Ignoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the piece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a symbol of a cockroach to the left of the list. 
LANDLADY Miss Cardinale... Open up for me, please! 
He gets up and peeks through the security hole. He sees a middle- aged Hispanic woman reaching to unlock the door. He opens it. 
LANDLADY (CONT'D) Ohhh, Dios mio! 
She stares at him levelly. 
LANDLADY (CONT'D) I just want the rent. 
BASQUIAT Why didn't you say so? Damn! She's asleep! 
Jean draws on a piece of paper on the counter next to him. He hands it to the landlady. It's a a little shack with a big head next to it that says "'Here' For Rent." 
The landlady looks at him like he's crazy. She balls up the drawing and puts it in her pocket. 
Gina arrives in the doorway, wearing a robe. The landlady's trapped between them. 
GINA (to Jean) What're you doing? 
The landlady wags her finger at Gina. 
LANDLADY Next Monday. 
Gina and Jean look amused as they watch her leave. 
BASQUIAT Wanna go get some breakfast? 
GINA A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago. 
She looks at the bugspray drawing on the floor. 
GINA (CONT'D) Ohh, that's nice. 
Jean kisses her neck as she looks at the drawing. 
We HOLD on the drawing. 
INT. MARY BOONE GALLERY - DAY 
White dust sprinkles down onto Jean's face from the ceiling. Unable to use his hands, he tries to blow the dust out of his eyes... 
His boss, GREG, a mild-mannered hippie electrician, works above him on the ladder. Jean steadies the ladder. Greg's head is out of frame. 
The gallery is an impressive space under preparations for an opening. 
GREG Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver? 
BASQUIAT A what? 
THROUGH THE WINDOW 
He sees Albert Milo    talking with ANDY WARHOL and BRUNO BISCHOFBERGER. Andy,    of course, is thin, silver-haired, and nearly albino. Bruno    is a Swiss art dealer in his 40's. He exudes money - a pillar of    security. 
On the other side of the room, Rene Ricard is surrounded by a coterie of young, mostly BLACK AND HISPANIC MALES. Rene looks drunk, enjoying the moment, holding court. 
Rene crosses to Albert and Andy. 
People pass by. 
Jean starts to walk. 
About half a block away, he sprays on a wall: 
"THE WHOLE LIVERY LINE BOW LIKE THIS WITH THE BIG MONEY ALL CRUSHED INTO THESE FEET" 
He looks pleased. He turns and looks up West Broadway beyond the buildings at the sky: 
SUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY 
We see a surfer emerging from a HUGE WAVE. He looks powerful and exalted. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY 
ANGLE ON: A wall. We see the following graffity: 
"JIMMY BEST ON HIS BACK TO THE SUCKERPUNCH OF HIS CHILDHOOD YEARS" 
A basketball bounces against a wall. 
Jean and Benny amble onto a basketball court. Jean's changed his hairstyle. Now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head. 
Benny dribbles with skill while Jean puffs furiously on a cigarette. He doesn't look like he's slept, but he's happy. 
Benny throws the ball to Jean. It bounces off a puddle and splashes Jean. 
BENNY Come on, Jean. Get rid of your cigarette. Concentrate. 
BASQUIAT I am... On Gina. (beat) Fuck - I didn't think we were actually gonna do this. 
BENNY Concentrate on the ball. Shoot. 
Jean shoots. It flies up, up, up -     and over the backboard. 
He runs after the ball, gets it, and dribbles clumsily. 
BENNY You're shattering all my myths. 
BASQUIAT About what? 
BENNY Your people. 
BASQUIAT Oh - you mean black people! 
He shoots and misses again. He throws it to Benny, who does a picture-perfect lay-up. 
BASQUIAT (CONT'D) (changing the subject) How long do you think it takes to get really famous? 
During the following, Benny performs a series of amazing shots while Jean looks on admiringly. 
BENNY For a musician or a painter? 
Jean shrugs. 
BASQUIAT Whatever. Famous. To where you can do your stuff all day without thinking about anything else. 
BENNY Ummm... Four years. Six to get rich. 
He shoots. Swish. 
BENNY (CONT'D) First, you have to dress right. 
He shoots again. Swish. 
BENNY (CONT'D) Then, you have to hang out all the time - with famous people - the right people, the right chicks, the right parties. 
He shoots again. Swish. 
BENNY (CONT'D) And you gotta do your work all the time when you're not doing that. The same kinda work, the same style - over and over again, so people recognize it and don't get confused. Then, once you're famous, you have to keep doing it the same way, even after it's boring - unless you want people to really get mad at you - which they will anyway. 
Benny tosses Jean the ball. Jean walks off the court. 
ANDY WARHOL I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these. 
BASQUIAT You don't even work on your stuff! 
BRUNO It doesn't matter how much you worked on 
them. It matters how much you can get for them. 
BASQUIAT I can get ten. 
ANDY WARHOL I'll take two. This one and... that one. (to Bruno) Can I borrow some money, Bruno? 
Bruno pulls out a hundred dollar bill. 
BRUNO Here. Do you have change? 
As WAITER arrives with the tray, Jean pockets the bill. 
BASQUIAT You made a good deal. Here, you can have these, too. 
He leaves all the cards and walks toward the door. 
BRUNO'S POV: 
Jean leaving past stupified Maitre'd. 
EXT. GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Jean and Benny are outside the entrance to Gina's building. Jean carries two huge bags overflowing with groceries and flowers. He buzzes. There's no answer. 
BASQUIAT I'll be right back. 
He produces a key and lets himself in. 
He enters the building. 
INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Jean sets the groceries on the counter and leaves. 
We notice the Bugspray painting on the wall, along with more of Jean's work and supplies. 
EXT. GINA'S APARTMENT - DUSK 
Jean rejoins Benny in front of Gina's building. 
As they're leaving, Gina comes up the street. 
BASQUIAT (to Benny) Check you later, man. 
BENNY Hi Gina. 
GINA Hi. 
INT - GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Flowers and groceries are strewn on the counter. 
FADE TO BLACK 
FADE IN: 
Over the following MONTAGE we HEAR: 
RENE (O.S.) ... 'APT 20'... The church bells would ring at noon and six a.m.. 24 strokes: How many times we counted them. We called our bed the cloud. And there we'd float. The bathtub was in the kitchen and took forever to fill up. We'd bathe together afterwards. Oh the countless cigarettes and take out Chinese food... The bed was so narrow Three years we made it fit. The sheets were green the sheets were pink the sheets white linen from the past. Little home, farewell, The broken windows and the bodega on the corner. Now from my balcony I look out over all New York... 
INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Jean and Gina are sleeping. 
SERIES OF DISSOLVES: As they're turning together in their sleep. 
FADE TO BLACK 
FADE UP: 
INT. KITCHEN / LIVINGROOM (GINA'S APARTMENT) - DAY 
Filled with Jean's paintings. 
SERIES OF DISSOLVES: Paintings and objects fill the room. 
FADE TO BLACK 
FADE TO WHITE 
INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
CAMERA PULLS BACK: Revealing Jean's eyes. They're open and motionless. His head is tilted toward his chest. 
OFF SCREEN WE HEAR the sounds of Gina coming home: 
The LOCK turns. The door OPENS. 
Gina comes in and drops a bag on the floor. 
GINA Basquiat? 
Silence. She picks up the mail from under the door and walks into the room. There's a lump on the floor. It's Jean. 
GINA (CONT'D) Wake up! I'm back! 
She shakes his arm. No result. She lifts his head, revealing his painted hair. 
She shakes him harder. His body is totally limp. 
The whites of his eyes are red; his pupils slowly float up, vanishing. 
GINA Jean, what did you do to yourself? 
She listens to his breath, then to his heart. 
GINA 
(panicking) Jesus Christ! 
She finds heroin sprinkled into some pot on the floor near him. 
GINA (slapping his face) Don't do this to me. 
She shakes him until his eyes unglue. His pupils float into their proper place. 
BASQUIAT ... What's the matter? 
GINA (furious) Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself? 
BASQUIAT You're back. 
GINA It's Monday morning. 
BASQUIAT It's not Sunday? I missed you. You shouldn't leave me alone. 
GINA You're blaming me? I had to go see my family. 
BASQUIAT I'm your family. 
GINA Basquiat, what did you take? 
Jean tries to pick himself up from the floor. He gets up stiffly, like Pinnocchio. The long sleep made his limbs wooden. 
BASQUIAT Nothing special - just some weed. 
He finds an old joint and lights it up. 
GINA Basquiat, don't lie. (holds up powder) This is smack. 
BASQUIAT You want some? 
He offers her the joint. 
EXT. ST. MARK'S PLACE - NIGHT 
Jean and Benny walk along, sharing a beer in a brown paper bag. 
They approach a DRUG DEALER and exchange money for dope. 
Jean finds a discarded window frame in a pile of trash and carries it with him. 
They sit down on a stoop. Jean rolls up a dollar bill, empties the dope onto the window, and splits it into two lines. He hands the rolled up bill to Benny, who snorts the line. 
Benny shakes his head involuntarily, making a violent face, as though the dope burned a hole in his sinus. 
BENNY We got beat. 
BASQUIAT For real? 
Jean takes a taste with his finger... He tastes his tongue and makes a face.. 
ARTIST #1 (yelling from the window) Rene, man, check this out. Whoa... He's kinda cute. 
Rene looks to him and back at the painting. He takes one last look. 
He stumbles towards the window and grabs the binoculars from Artist #1.. 
We look through the binoculars' POV at a GUY coming down the street. He's wearing all black, cowboy boots, and sunglasses. 
RENE Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick. 
ARTIST #2 How do you know? 
RENE Just look at him. 
(Rene hands the binoculars to him) Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so. 
He looks around the room again as if looking for Jean. 
ARTIST #3 Whoa - check it out. It's him! 
Rene grabs binoculars. 
BINOCULARS POV: 
Jean pauses before one of his own graffiti pieces: 
"PLUSH SAFE, HE THINK" 
Rene watches in awe. Jean, moving a bit slowly, `signs' his tag with the copyright sign. He walks off. 
RENE MOTHAFUCKAH! 
ARTIST #2 That's the same guy who did this painting. 
RENE I know that. Don't let him get away. 
He hands the binoculars to Artist #3 and runs towards the door. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
BINOCULARS POV 
We watch as Rene looks frantically for Jean, but can't spot him. Finally he sees Jean's hair-do bobbing up and down a block away. He runs towards it. 
RENE Hey, wait up!!! 
Huffing and puffing, he catches up. 
RENE You heard of Albert Milo. I made    that niggah. I'm Rene Ricard. Didn't    you read "Not About Albert Milo?" I know    who to hype. Baby, I'm gonna make you a    star. 
BASQUIAT Can you put me in the ring with him? 
RENE I can put you in the ring with him. Even book the dates. (beat) But those big boys know how to fight. They 
could make you look real sissy. (they laugh) I was looking at that painting upstairs. It's the first time a picture made me embarrassed to own anything. (beat) So what's your real name? 'Samo?' 
BASQUIAT Jean Michel Basquiat. 
They shake hands. 
RENE Sounds famous already. 
INT. PS 1 SHOW - DAY 
INSERT:   A huge poster reads: 
"NEW YORK / NEW WAVE 100 ARTISTS" 
CLOSE ON: A HAMMER, POUNDING 
Jean pounds a nail into one of his pieces, nailing it directly onto the wall. Everyone stares. 
RENE Oh child... You got no respect. Didn't anyone teach you how to mount paintings? 
Rene smiles. Jean finishes pounding the last piece into the wall. 
CAMERA pulls back to reveal several of Jean's paintings - found objects with paint on them. 
RENE (CONT'D) This is a very important season in New York. One's public appearance is absolute. (beat - a man approaches) Oh!!! Louise!!! I'd like you to meet Jean Michel Basquiat - (beat) SAMO. This is Henry Geldzahler. 
A crowd begins to gather around the work. 
HENRY Ohh... SAMO. I've heard a lot about you. I love your graffiti. 
GINA Staten Island would be ok. 
Beat. Silence. 
Jean can't sleep. He stares at the ceiling. 
BASQUIAT Do you wanna marry me? 
Beat. 
No reply. 
Gina's asleep. 
INT. GINA'S APARTMENT (KITCHEN) - LATER (NIGHT) 
Quietly, Jean kneels on the floor of the kitchen. He paints on an old window. 
He draws figures of three people sitting at a table - obviously a family. He crosses out one person and paints a dog under the table. 
He crosses everything out. 
He mixes the paint in a large bowl and starts again. 
Again, he crosses everything out. 
INT - GINA'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Jean continues to work. He's wearing pajamas and a bathrobe. 
Gina enters, waking up. 
She looks at the painting. 
GINA Kind of a family portrait. 
Jean moves to add something. She stops him. 
GINA (CONT'D) It looks done. 
BASQUIAT Think so? 
He pauses. 
BASQUIAT (CONT'D) ... babies. 
GINA You mean babies with you? 
BASQUIAT What's wrong with me? 
GINA You're your own baby. 
Jean paints out the image. 
There's a KNOCK at the door. 
GINA Who is it? 
ANNINA NOSEI (O.S) Annina Nosei. 
GINA Who? 
Jean jumps up and locks himself in the bathroom. Gina goes to the door, unlocks the chain, and looks out. 
GINA (CONT'D) (through the crack) Hello? Oh. Come in. 
She opens the door. 
ANNINA NOSEI Is Jean Michel here? 
GINA No. 
Closed in the bathroom, Jean smiles while eavesdropping. 
ANNINA NOSEI I'm here to see some work. 
Annina starts noticing all the work around her. Gina hands her a stack of drawings. 
ANNINA NOSEI (CONT'D) These are great. 
GINA Aren't they? 
ANNINA NOSEI How much for these five? 
Annina flips on a light. 
ANNINA NOSEI Here it is. 
Jean looks around him. He's in a large, empty cement-floored room lit by fluorescent lights. 
INT. BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - (LATER) - DAY 
Jean bends over, beginning several canvases. He pours paint on them - kind of like photographs we've seen of Jackson Pollock. We HEAR Miles Davis' "Flamenco Sketches." 
INT - BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - DAY (LATER) 
GRANDMASTER FLASH'S "WHITE LINES" fills the room. 
The walls are covered with half-finished, unstretched CANVASES. Two or three more lie on the floor. 
He works like a maniac, buzzing back and forth from one painting to another, adding figures, crossing out words, all the while smoking and eating cookies. The crumbs fall onto the paintings. He walks on them. 
Every so often, he refers to a book of DaVinci drawings. Torn pages litter the floor beneath the book. 
We hear someone THUMPING down the stairs. 
It's Rene. A PUPPY follows him. 
He dumps a huge load of paint supplies, art books, and carryout ribs. The puppy sniffs around happily, licking at Jean and walking over the paintings, wagging his tail. 
He stops the tape player and inserts some Persian music. 
Jean empties some foil-wrapped bags of coke. He cuts a line of coke on a foil plate. 
Rene starts reading from a poem he's evidently written: 
RENE 3rd night I called    him 'boy' He sed "don't call    me 'boy'" "Well Then don't call me    'Boss'" That Was the end for us    and I've Been seeing him for    2 1/2 years. In kangaroo court I    want to be 
Able to say I never kept a Slave. But he tricked me in To Tying him up and busting his Face. He'll jump up at my Trial Yelling 'He wupped me gud.' 
Jean warms the plate 'til the coke crackles, and then "chases the dragon," sucking the smoke through a straw. 
He offers it to Rene, who refuses. He lights and hands Rene the joint. Rene takes a hit. Jean takes it back. 
Jean starts to work again. 
The PUPPY runs around, chasing after him, getting in his way, running across the paintings. Jean laughs, playing tag. The puppy gets a hold of Jean's sleeve. It unravels about ten feet. 
While Jean's playing, Rene spots a painting with the words "Famous Negro Athletes." 
RENE Oh man! That's one looks famous already. 
Without hearing him, Jean walks towards the painting and with a swipe, paints out what Rene is pointing to. 
RENE (CONT'D) You are a willful boy. How'm I s'posed to write about you if you keep changing everything? 
The phone RINGS... Jean ignores it. Rene gets it - 
RENE (CONT'D) Uh huhh... Band practice? (to Jean) It's Benny. He wants to know why you're not at band practice...? 
BASQUIAT (quietly) Fuck... (to Rene) I forgot about that. 
He sets his brush down. 
Rene hold the phone against his leg. 
RENE Fuck band practice... If you're gonna be a painter you're gonna have to break a few hearts - you don't wanna be like Tony Bennett.. 
BASQUIAT Tony Bennett... What do you mean? 
RENE Singing on stage and painting in your spare 
time. 
BASQUIAT I didn't know Tony Bennett painted. 
RENE My point exactly. 
Jean picks up the phone... All he hears is a DIAL TONE. 
RENE (CONT'D) So keep painting. 
BASQUIAT Yes, Boss. (beat) If you're so smart, why are you here with me in this basement? 
RENE You're news. I want the scoop. I write it down. When I speak, no one believes me. But when I write it down, people know it's true. (beat) There's never been a black painter in art history that's been considered really important, you know? 
BASQUIAT So what? 
ANNINA NOSEI Here's a very good example of his recent work that's not spoken for yet. (beat) He's got to work in a basement. He's got so much energy that if he worked in a place with a window, he'd jump right through it. Most of these are reserved already. After this week, this work will not be available. 
TOM KRUGER (to his wife) ... I don't know.... This one's nice, but I don't know if I could live with it. That green is so... institutional. 
He (Kruger) looks up to see two KIDS enter - young black artists, one of whom we saw with Rene at the loft party. 
They walk right into the middle of the room, completely oblivious to the presence of Annina and the Krugers.. 
KID #1 (enthusiastically) Yo, man, you're a damn lucky nigger selling this shit! 
BASQUIAT You like it? 
KID #1 Not bad. Yeah, I do. 
The Krugers hem and haw in front of the painting next to Jean. 
CYNTHIA KRUGER I'm fascinated by his choice of crossing out words that way. 
ANNINA NOSEI Yes, well, they are more meaningful in their absence, no? 
KID #1 (to Jean, joking) What does it mean? 
Jean paints the words "Rene 5:11" back into a painting. They ignore the kid.. 
CYNTHIA KRUGER I like this one, but that green... 
Suddenly, we see LEGS coming down the stairs. It's Gina. Everyone looks at her. 
BASQUIAT Y'want me to make it a nice shit brown? 
TOM KRUGER Beg pardon? 
Gina hadn't expected to find herself in the middle of this scene. 
BASQUIAT Hi. This is Gina. 
Annina nods to her. 
Gina nods to the group. 
CYNTHIA KRUGER They're something like Dubuffet's... That... childlike quality. 
Gina tries to connect with Jean. He's cold. 
CYNTHIA KRUGER (CONT'D) (to her husband and Annina) 
I can't make up my mind. 
TOM KRUGER I like this one. If it were just another color.. 
BASQUIAT Get a fucking decorator. If you buy one, you'll have to change your whole lives - maybe even sell your kids! (to Annina) These paintings aren't even done yet!!! 
He sets his brush down. As he leaves - 
TOM KRUGER (O.S.) I think we'll take the green one. 
HOLD ON: 
Gina, left standing in the middle of this. 
INT. MCDONALDS - DAY 
CLOSE ON McDonald's COUNTERMAN. He smiles. 
BASQUIAT I'll take three big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie. 
COUNTERMAN You want three Big Macs, two chocolate shakes, two orders of fries, and an apple pie. 
A line begins forming behind Jean. 
BASQUIAT Forget it .I'll take six, no, seven chocolate shakes, an order of fries, a Big Mac, and two apple pies. 
COUNTERMAN You only want one Big Mac? 
The people in line are beginning to get impatient. 
BASQUIAT Yeah... And make it three apple pies. 
EXT. SOHO STREET - DAY 
Jean leans on a fire hydrant, eating a Big Mac. 
A pink scarf blows on the wind right in front of his face. He catches it. 
MAN (wildly enthusiastic) Jean, man!!! Let's make a record! 
WOMAN (slyly, intimately) You finally did it. 
MAN #2 (pointing to Jean, sneering) He's so fulla shit. 
MAN #3 (O.S.) How much is he getting for these? 
Jean walks up to Andy Warhol. 
BASQUIAT Andy, man, thanks for coming. I'd like to paint your jacket. 
ANDY WARHOL My jacket? Gee, great... (he Polaroids Jean) Your show looks great. Quite a turnout. You look great. You kids. You drink red wine with fish. You can do anything! Make paintings in the basement of your gallery? First time I've heard of that! 
They are approached by Mary Boone, a short woman in high heels and an Armani suit). 
ANDY WARHOL (CONT'D) Jean Michel, this is Mary Boone. She's got the great new gallery. 
BASQUIAT Yeah, I met her already. 
MARY BOONE (shaking Jean's hand) You should be pleased. It's a great show...I'm having a dinner later at Mr. Chow's for Albert. You should come. 
In the background, we see Annina watching. 
ANDY WARHOL You'll like it. Everyone'll be there. 
Annina walks over to Jean with a COUPLE. 
ANNINA NOSEI Jean, your parents are here. 
BASQUIAT Hi Dad. Hi Nora. 
NORA Congratulations. 
BASQUIAT Thanks for coming. 
Rene appears out of the crowd. 
ANNINA NOSEI (continuing to Jean's father) You must be very proud. 
FATHER I am! 
RENE How does it feel to have a genius in the family? 
FATHER It feels... good! 
Jean notices Benny across the room. He slows down and waves. 
Jean sees Gina across the room wearing the scarf. 
Just beyond her, he sees Big Pink approaching. 
There must be ten people between them. 
BASQUIAT (to Rene) I'll be right back. 
He moves towards her. Suddenly, directly in front of him are the Krugers. 
TOM KRUGER We love our painting. 
BASQUIAT Which painting? 
TOM KRUGER The green one. 
BASQUIAT Oh yeah. 
CYNTHIA KRUGER We got a couch to match. 
TOM KRUGER She's only kidding! 
Looking past the Krugers, Jean looks for Gina. He sees her. His path is blocked. 
He presses forward, looking for Gina, getting caught in the crowd. 
Jean strains to keep an eye on Gina and Big Pink.. 
Benny arrives at Jean's side holding a bottle of Jack Daniels and a shot glass. 
BENNY Willie Mays. A Toast. 
Jean brushes past him. 
BASQUIAT Not now, ok? 
Esther Milo, watching. 
RENE (CONT'D) I'm starving. You can't buy    advertising like this. This is the most    glamorous dinner you'll have here this    fall. How about some of that imitation    crab? 
MR. CHOW I'm not paying for the drawing with crab. It's a present to my friends. It's my birthday. 
Jean finishes his drawing - a big beautiful head that fills the screen. 
Rene grabs it from him. He holds it up for everyone to see. 
RENE Isn't he great? Thanks, Jean. 
He rips the page from the book. 
RENE (CONT'D) He owes me one. 
Everyone's face drops. Mr. Chow grabs his book. He motions to a couple WAITERS - 
MR. CHOW You're too much, Rene. Get this guy out of here. 
RENE I haven't eaten yet!!! 
The waiters grab Rene's arms. 
RENE (CONT'D) Hands off me, you faggots! I'm going. I'm going...I've kept Diana Vreeland waiting too long, anyway. 
ANDY WARHOL Wow... That was a nice drawing, too, Jean. Maybe you should do another one. 
MR. CHOW (exhausted) Some other time. 
Spontaneously, David McDermott climbs onto the tabletop downstairs and sings "Paris Je T'aime." 
As he belts it out in a theatrical falsetto, he glides over glasses and plates, executing a leap to another table in mid- song. 
The restaurant staff and OTHER DINNER GUESTS watch, agape. 
CLOSE UP - DAVID'S SHOES. 
As David dances, Annina walks over to the table, greeting people and saying goodnight. 
ANNINA NOSEI (to Jean) It's great that people are interested, but if anyone's going to buy anything, I'll handle it for you. Everything goes through the gallery, even if they come to your studio. 
BASQUIAT Sure. 
Annina leaves. 
Jean leans back in his chair, taking in this splendid new world. He pulls out a joint, lights up, inhales with pleasure, closes his eyes and smiles. 
SUPER OVER HIS FACE: "FOUR YEARS LATER" 
SCREEN GOES BLACK 
INTERVIEWER (O.S.) ... had twenty-three one man shows, been in forty three group shows from Zurich to Tokyo.. 
FADE UP 
INT. GREAT JONES STREET LOFT - DAY 
Note: The following scene is shot in documentary style. 
INTERVIEWER (O.S, CONT'D) ... had over fifty articles written about you, switched galleries - how many times? - DJ'd in the hottest clubs - 
Jean looks out the window, yawns and rubs his eyes. He now sports dreadlocks bundled into groups of spikes sticking out of his head. He wears a wrinkled Wesleyan College T-shirt, paint- splattered jeans, and no shoes; just out of bed, it would seem. 
An INTERVIEWER - a balding Brit with all the humor of a bank clerk - tries to buddy up with Jean on camera. 
INTERVIEWER   (CONT'D) ... one of the youngest    artists ever to be included in the Whitney    Biennial, also produced a rap record.    It's said you're quite the ladies man -    even dated Madonna for a couple months!!! (takes a breath) All at the ripe old age    of 24. One might ask: is there anything    left for Jean Michel Basquiat to do? 
Jean and the interviewer face each other in front of one of Jean's paintings. Jean stares at the interviewer, incredulous. 
INTERVIEWER (CONT'D) What is it that gets you out of bed in the morning? (nervous laugh) 
BASQUIAT I hate this. Turn that off. 
Jean walks off camera and disappears into his bedroom. 
Shenge (the former limo driver, now working as Jean's assistant) assembles stretchers. 
SUPER: "GREAT JONES STREET, 1985" 
A CAMERA CREW waits in the room. Jean returns. 
INTERVIEWER We're running a little late. 
BASQUIAT Yeah, just put their bill on my tab. 
GEORGE Really? 
BASQUIAT Yeah. 
GEORGE Very well. 
He moves off towards the executives. George whispers to the HEAD EXECUTIVE, and nods towards Jean. The executives spread the words amongst themselves. They're horrified. 
BASQUIAT (continuing) Baby, I think about you a lot. I'm really sorry about everything. You have to believe me. I'm serious. I wish, y'know, that we were - 
GINA I don't believe it, Jean - they're picking straws. 
A YOUNG EXECUTIVE, obviously the loser, takes a deep breath and heads towards them. 
YOUNG EXECUTIVE 
Excuse me... On behalf of my friends I'd like to apologize. We're really sorry. 
BASQUIAT I wish you niggahs could get it togeth- ahhhhhh. 
The Executive reaches to shake Jean's hand. Jean puts a hundred dollar bill in his hand. 
YOUNG EXECUTIVE What's this for? 
BASQUIAT The tip. 
Jean turns back to Gina. The Executive leaves them. George smiles. 
GINA You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't. 
BASQUIAT What's his name? 
Gina balks. Rather than face a disappointment - 
BASQUIAT (CONT'D) I have to go to the bathroom. 
INT. BARBETTA'S (BATHROOM) - DAY 
CLOSE ON JEAN - looking in the mirror. 
He looks at himself. 
He starts to pick at his face. 
INT. PALLADIUM - HUGE ROOM - NIGHT 
Jean and Albert Milo sit on a banquette 
A huge white painting of Jean's with a dragon's head hangs on one wall to their left. On the opposite wall in back of the bar hangs another huge painting with a lot of heads, mostly black. 
Lots of PEOPLE mill about a huge room. 
A GIRL - another Gina look-alike walks through the crowd. Jean's eyes follow her momentarily.. 
BASQUIAT (re: the paintings) What do you think? 
ALBERT MILO 
I like the one with the dragon's heads a lot. But the black one's filled up with too many heads... (beat) I'd take some of them out. (beat) I think you're painting too fast. I wouldn't put in so many heads. Let it breathe a bit. 
BASQUIAT It's always how you would do it. This is my version. 
ALBERT MILO You're right. It's your version. You should come over to the studio sometime. 
BASQUIAT Why, so you could humiliate me? 
ALBERT MILO No, I wanted to make a painting of you. 
EXT. UNION SQUARE PARK - DAY 
Jean rides his bicycle through the park. He's looking up at the birds flying in the trees. 
ANGLE ON 
The birds. We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we have no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept. Store sign. The birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees. 
EXT. THE FACTORY (ENTRANCE) - DAY 
Jean presses a buzzer. He's admitted. He carries his bike on his shoulder. 
INT. THE FACTORY - DAY 
THREE KIDS in the process of prying a door panel with crowbars. 
We see that they're removing one of Jean's SAMO pieces from a wall. We read: 
"PAY FOR SOUP BUILD A FORT SET IT ON FIRE" 
Jean arrives behind them. 
BASQUIAT What's up? 
KID #1 Mind your own fuckin' business. 
BASQUIAT (recognizing his work) That's mine. 
KID That ain't yours, man. Some asshole named SAMO did this. 
KID#3 He's dead. That's what I heard. 
KID #2 He ain't dead yet. He's gonna kill himself. That's why all those art fags in Soho are paying more every time we bring one of these in. 
KID #1 Stupid SAMO... Hardly any of this shit left. 
The panel is almost pried free without a scratch. 
KID #3 This one's damn nice. I say we hang onto it if he's almost dead. 
Jean shoves his way in front with a magic marker and adds a couple words; now it reads: 
"SAMO IS DEAD" 
BASQUIAT There you go. Now it's worth more. 
The kids are outraged, thinking Jean's ruined their find. 
They jump on him. 
They beat the shit out of him. 
They're done. 
Jean lies curled up on the ground, trying to talk. 
KID #2 What's he saying? 
BASQUIAT I'm SAMO... I'm SAMO... 
KID #3 (bending close) He says he's SAMO. 
Kid #1 whacks him in the back once more for good measure. 
KID #1 He wish. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
THE SEA 
It is flat, dead, gray. 
Ominous and waiting. 
INT. GREAT JONES ST. LOFT - DAY 
Washed in sunlight, a large painting leans against the wall, the words "HAITIAN BASEBALL FACTORIES" scrawled through its center. 
Jean lays down, watching TV. 
He looks older now, more worn. His face is slightly swollen. His complexion is discolored. 
Shenge covers a triptych with wide brush strokes of yellow paint. He circles a large, primitive figure of a black man drawn with magic marker in the center. He is careful to leave the figure intact. 
BASQUIAT Paint it out. 
SHENGE Out? 
BASQUIAT Yeah... Maybe just his arms. 
(Shenge paints out the arms) Put some Cerulean Blue there. 
Jean points to the lower corner. 
Shenge picks up the phone, which has been RINGING for some time. 
SHENGE It's Andy again. 
Jean enters the gallery. Cleaned up. Healthier. Bruises healing. 
He looks like he's been painting. 
Mary looks up from her desk, surprised to see Jean. 
MARY BOONE Jean Michel... Crawling from the wreckage? 
BASQUIAT I need a dealer. 
MARY BOONE You have a bunch of them, don't you? Albert Milo walks in from another room. 
ALBERT MILO Hey Jean! (to Mary) It'll never fit. 
MARY BOONE It'll be ok. 
ALBERT MILO You better take a look. Why's your door so small? The ceilings are sixteen feet and your door's the size of a mouse hole! 
MARY BOONE 
Why are your paintings so big? Just go home. I'll get it in. 
ALBERT MILO (to Jean) You doing anything right now? 
BASQUIAT Naa.. 
ALBERT MILO Let's get out of here. 
BASQUIAT See ya in an hour. (to Mary) So what do you think? 
MARY BOONE Bruno spoke to me already. We could talk about it. 
BASQUIAT I'm here. 
MARY BOONE OK. I'll be at your studio Thursday three o'clock. 
INT. ALBERT MILO'S LOFT - DAY 
Albert shows Jean through a series of large rooms filled with enormous paintings. 
It looks like the Cairo Museum. 
They pause before a painting. 
ALBERT MILO This is painted on a backdrop from the Kabuki theater in Japan. I painted it after Joseph Beuys died. A rebirth painting. I felt like he could've painted it, or maybe someone else was painting it instead of me. The Chinese calligraphers used to change their name mid-career so they could start over as someone else.. 
BASQUIAT Do you ever get sick of it? 
ALBERT MILO Of what? 
BASQUIAT The whole thing - painting. 
ALBERT MILO No. It's one of the few times I feel good. I used to have to go to work and cook every 
day. That I got sick of. 
BASQUIAT What about the shit they write? 
ALBERT MILO You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them. 
BASQUIAT I haven't felt like talking to him since that thing came out. 
ALBERT MILO As long as I've known Andy, he's never asked me for anything except to speak to you about getting off drugs. He's painted my picture, we've eaten dinner in God knows how many places together. But he doesn't care about me. He cares about you. You're the only person he cares about. He's your friend. Fuck that article. You want a toasted bagel with cream cheese? 
Milo's daughter STELLA (12) calls out from over the balcony. 
STELLA (O.S.) Papa, the TV's broken... Will you fix it please? 
ALBERT MILO Alright. I'll be right up. 
Albert leaves. 
Jean looks at some paintings. 
Stella comes downstairs. 
STELLA (to Jean) Hi. 
BASQUIAT Hi. 
STELLA I've seen you before. I like your paintings a lot. Your hair was different. 
BASQUIAT 
Held in Jean's hand. It's stalled in mid-stroke. He writes with a magic marker on the heel of two wooden clogs the word: "TITANIC" 
There's a loud BANGING at the door. 
When it stops, the pencil tip resumes its long voyage across the page. 
MUSIC UP: Tom Waits' "Tom Traubert's Blues" 
EXT. GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Jean buzzes the doorbell. He's wearing the clogs. He's hurting. The intercom comes on. 
BASQUIAT Hello? Gina? 
MALE VOICE Who is it? 
Jean recognizes Benny's voice. 
ANGLE UP 
Gina and Benny look out the window into the street. 
Jean's a block away. 
EXT. MENTAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Jean gets out of a cab. He walks up to the entrance. 
The doors are locked. He rattles them. 
Inside, an OLD JANITOR keeps mopping. 
Jean pounds harder, RATTLES the doors more. 
BASQUIAT Hey, come here! Please. Just for a second. Open the door. 
The janitor gets nervous. He leaves. 
He returns a moment later with a large SECURITY GUARD. 
BASQUIAT Open up! Open up! 
The guard unlocks the door, hoping to settle Jean down. 
BASQUIAT (CONT'D) My mother's inside. 
GUARD Come back tomorrow. Visiting hours are over. (beat) Don't cause any trouble. 
BASQUIAT I'm not here to visit... I wanna take her home. 
The guard gently ushers Jean out through the door. 
GUARD Don't cause any trouble. 
He locks the door and walks off with the janitor. 
EXT. STREET - DAYBREAK 
Jean, walks around, drifting, stoned. He looks up at the skyline. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
Waves crash silently over a surfer. 
FADE TO BLACK 
FADE IN: 
STREET SOUNDS 
BENNY (O.S.) Willie Mays. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. STREET -   MORNING 
Jean has been passed out on a sidewalk. 
CLOSE ON: Benny's face. 
He leans over Jean and helps him up. 
BASQUIAT Willie Mays... Nice to see you.

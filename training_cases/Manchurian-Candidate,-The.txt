MARCO'S VOICE 
Approximately sixty four hundred hours before Desert Storm, we were on a routine recon inside Iraqi-controlled terrain, assessing troop strength for what Saddam Hussein promised to be the mother of all wars ... but turned out to be just a little warm up for the whomping he got a few years later. 
FADE IN: 
2   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                           2 
PROWLING ACROSS undulating land dotted with BURNING OIL WELLS that give the vague impression of, well, hell. The inky sky is awash with stars. 
ON THE CREST OF A DUNE 
A U.S. ARMY BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE and matching HUMMER sit, waiting. 
KUWAIT, 1991 
Muffled THUMP of rap music thrums from the Bradley, and low voices stray from the open doors of the Hummer. 
MARCO (O.S.) 
Why can't we go directly in ... 
3   INT./EXT. THE HUMMER - NIGHT                                  3 
A topographical MAP glows on the LCD screen of a laptop portable, faintly lighting the faces of CAPT. BEN MARCO and his big, gentle, French guide, LAURENT TOKAR. 
MARCO 
(pointing) ... this way --? 
LAURENT 
Yes, well -- I see the Captain enjoys the road less travelled. Marco is seemingly unflappable, completely engaged by life. 
MARCO 
The Captain enjoys not dragging his ass down the highway for every Tom, Dick and Qadhafi to take a whack at. Laurent swings his finger on the arc of approach. 
LAURENT 
Well. Of course it is very bad, here. And here. And here, here, here, here -- 
MARCO 
Mines? 
LAURENT 
Tricky.    Swedish-made. 
MARCO 
Dammit. He refers to some satellite surveillance maps -- 
MARCO 
Nobody at Command said anything about -- 
LAURENT 
Exxon and Global Petroleum hired private contractors to do the work in '86, as part of their asset security program. (beat) Hired an Iraqi firm, in fact, who, now, well -- only they know where the little Nordic fuckers are planted. 
MARCO 
(turns away) Sgt. Shaw! No response. And we RUSH TOWARD: A SOLDIER IN A LAWN CHAIR, face lifted to the heavens, sitting directly between the two armored vehicles. This is SGT. RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW, late twenties, haunted and aloof. 
MARCO 
(suddenly behind him) Sergeant. 
RAYMOND 
Sir. 
MARCO 
Rolling in two minutes. 
RAYMOND 
Yes sir. Beat. 
MARCO 
Everything okay? 
RAYMOND 
Yes, Captain. Everything's fine.   Here. (standing up) I'll "rally" the troops. 
4   INT. THE BRADLEY FIGHTING VEHICLE - NIGHT                     4 
MUSIC blares around eight soldiers, including wiseguy PFC. ED MAVOLE, crowded into space designed for four -- 
MAVOLE 
Yo Melvin. You gonna play that hand, or hatch it? -- CPL. AL MELVIN grunts, then they all look up, almost in unison, at Raymond when he swings open the back door. PFC. BOBBY BAKER, a slender man, barely eighteen, a driver, ejects a CD from the onboard stereo. Silence. 
RAYMOND 
We're moving out. Beat.   He shuts the door again. 
5   EXT. THE BRADLEY - NIGHT                                      5 
Raymond waits. Another beat.     Then some LAUGHTER from inside the vehicle. He shifts his shoulders, walks back into the darkness. 
24   OMITTED                                                            24 
25   THE ROCKET hits the Bradley Fighting Vehicle at a slant into       25 its exposed belly, and the truck EXPLODES -- Marco's team scattering, pressing themselves into the sand, covering their heads -- 
A BOY'S VOICE 
(amplified) Were you scared? THICK DARK SMOKE momentarily blankets the road.    Silence. 
FLASH FORWARD: A YOUNG BOY SCOUT - DAY                             26 
waiting for an answer, stares earnestly upward at: 
FLASH FORWARD: MAJOR BEN MARCO - DAY 
behind a podium, in his crisp dress uniform.    His current self: older, tired. Lost for a moment. 
MARCO 
Scared? (long beat) You don't really have time to be scared. Uneasy rustling of an o.s. audience. Somebody coughs.         An air-conditioner KICKS IN, rumbling, becoming -- 
27   EXT. THE KUWAITI HIGHWAY - NIGHT - MARCO                        27 
raises his head.   SEES: -- the Bradley, in flames. -- the Hummer, on its side in the ditch, headlights aglow -- -- shadows of enemy soldiers, retreating across the dunes. -- MILITARY HELICOPTERS materializing out of the smoke and darkness ... circling ... NO SOUND -- 
MARCO (V.O.) 
I couldn't hear anything, as I was temporarily deaf from the explosion of the Bradley ... -- SOLDIERS WITH GAS MASKS lean out of the open doors of the helicopters and drop GAS CANISTERS down on Marco's team. 
IN SLOWING MOTION: 
28   MARCO'S SQUAD -- the effect of the gas is immediate: Mavole     28 collapses in his tracks. Melvin points a gun skyward and FIRES a burst that goes harmlessly wide of a helicopter. Then he falls on his back. HEAVY, LUMINOUS, YELLOW-ORANGE VAPOR swirls across the battle -- WITH MARCO -- his shirt pulled up over his mouth and nose, he wheels to get away from the drifting gas, feet unsteady. Grabs a dazed Bobby Baker by the collar -- 
MARCO 
I got your back, Baker.   I got ... -- and tries to pull him to safety ... knees buckling ... he looks up: 29   MARCO'S P.O.V. - THE HUMMER -- is no   longer stalled on its    29 side in the ditch, but improbably is   righted again, back on four wheels and attacking. A vision    of Raymond behind the machine gun, firing at the advancing   enemy -- WITH MARCO -- trying to process this.    Coughing.   Fading. 
30   OMITTED                                                         30

Behind the podium.   Takes a sip of water, then: 
MARCO 
-- and with complete disregard for his own life and safety, Sgt. Shaw single- handedly engaged an entire company of the enemy -- 
FLASH FORWARD: MAJOR MARCO 
Behind the podium, repeating himself:

32   EXT. KUWAITI TWO-LANE - NIGHT                                  32 
The Hummer weaves through the wreckage, one of its tires WHIRLING IN FLAMES -- Raymond has the machine gun SPITTING BULLETS recklessly at the helicopters like a cartoon hero -- 
33   RESUME: MARCO                                                  33 
MARCO 
(rote) Sgt. Shaw repeatedly attacked from a mobile position, confounding the enemy -- 
34   EXT. KUWAITI TWO-LANE - NIGHT                                  34 
One of the helicopters EXPLODES, the other spins away, trailing smoke and flames. 
MARCO (V.O.) 
-- neutralizing his aerial support --

36   INT. HIGH SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS                       36 
A Boy Scout luncheon banquet. 
WASHINGTON D.C., NOW 
A full chicken buffet table, banners, flags, and over one hundred SCOUTS, LEADERS and DADS, all looking somewhat attentively up at the guest speaker, U.S. Army Major Ben Marco. 
MARCO 
Like Edmonds in Korea, Holderman in Viet Nam, Raymond Shaw was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. I signed the recommendation myself. A hand shoots up.    Marco nods toward it. 
ANOTHER SCOUT 
Were you wounded? 
MARCO 
I was -- 
FB36   FLASH: MARCO ON THE KUWAITI TWO-LANE                        FB36 
Turning away from the overturned Humvee, and right into a head-high rifle-butt swung by the hands and arms of a gas mask-wearing figure. 
RESUME - AUDITORIUM - MARCO 
He blinks. 
MARCO 
-- injured. I fell, had a, uh, concussion -- lost focus -- Sgt. Shaw took command -- A disheveled man comes into the back of the room noisily, as: 
SCOUT DAD 
Did your unit sustain any casualties? 
MARCO 
Okay.   Okay. Well, look, Al, I gotta -- 
MELVIN 
Go. 
MARCO 
-- run, yeah. But. (awkward) It was great seeing you.   And good luck to you. Melvin just scowls sadly at Marco. Flash of glass, a door opens and closes, and Marco is gone. 
38   EXT. H.S. PARKING LOT - DAY                                    38 
Marco is motionless in his car, head resting against the steering wheel. He straightens up, with a thousand-yard stare. His hands are trembling. Slowly, he grips the steering wheel ... tighter and tighter ... until the trembling stops. 
39     INT. SUPERMARKET - CHECK-OUT COUNTER - NIGHT                      39 
A pretty CASHIER (ROSIE) empties Marco's basket: bottled water, three romance novels, a bottle of No-Doz, a bag of tomatoes and two dozen boxes of instant noodles. 
40     INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                        40 
Marco comes up the stairs with his groceries. An ELDERLY WOMAN sticks her head out from her apartment door: 
WOMAN 
-- Thirty seven. Marco stops, looks at her blankly. 
WOMAN 
From the landing. Every week it gets longer. I'm worried about you. He takes the romance novels out of his grocery bag and hands them to her. 
MARCO 
From the landing. Every week it gets longer. I'm worried about you. He takes the romance novels out of his grocery bag and hands them to her. 
MARCO 
None of these involve slave traders or sheiks, Abby. I checked. 
WOMAN 
(blushes) What do I owe you? 
MARCO 
(sad) A smile. She does. 
41     INT. MARCO'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT                             41 
He enters, and a visible exhaustion overtakes him.     He turns on the t.v., and sags to the sofa bed, drained. 
BEHIND HIM - ON A BULLETIN BOARD: 
yellowing newspaper clippings and wire photographs of Raymond Shaw. SENATOR'S SON SAVES UNIT IN KUWAIT. "LOST

News coverage, the crowded floor of a political convention: 
ROVING REPORTER 
-- with public anxiety rekindled by the events of Bloody Friday, with the war on terror marching into yet another year, no end in sight -- 
MARCO 
Yawns -- his eyelids flutter -- he shudders awake, digs in his grocery bag for the No Doz and shakes out half a dozen. Which he swallows dry. 
ROVING REPORTER 
-- the American people are looking for a new agenda -- but because this party remains deeply divided on so many issues, the choice of a vice presidential nominee may be the key unifying factor for the delegates of this convention in much the way Johnson helped Kennedy in 1960 ... Then he's up on his feet, moving to the kitchen through the small, cramped space overflowing with books, unopened boxes from Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble. 
42     INT. MARCO'S APARTMENT - LATER                                 42 
Marco sits at a clearing on the tiny kitchen table, eating instant noodles and trying to read Prizzi's Honor.

(on the t.v.) We need to look inward -- attend to our own house -- the danger to our country is not from some terrorists at large -- terrorists we've helped engender with twenty years of failed foreign policy -- An open cabinet door behind Marco reveals ROWS AND ROWS OF INSTANT NOODLES in the cupboard. 
ON THE TELEVISION 
News coverage, the crowded floor of a political convention. A poised, silvery, avuncular man, SENATOR THOMAS JORDAN (according to the title on the screen) on the podium: 
JORDAN 
-- no, the real danger is from suspending civil liberties, gutting the Bill of Rights, allowing our fear to destroy our democratic ideals -- 
43     INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT                                       43 
The same speech continues, largely ignored by Congressman RAYMOND PRENTISS SHAW. Still intense and moody, the new 
Raymond Shaw's suit is expensive and crisp, his hair perfect. He's playing solitaire. And winning. 
RAYMOND 
(murmurs) ... I am not a professional politician. I am not a professional politician ... 
TV43                       JORDAN (T.V.)                             TV43 
-- because once we start overturning our constitutional protections, our enemies have won. 
RAYMOND 
... I am ... a professional politician. Not. KNOCKING on his door -- it opens, and Secret Service AGENT EVAN ANDERSON removes his key while SEN. ELEANOR SHAW, pretty and ageless, sweeps in -- closing the door on her aide (GILLESPIE) -- 
ELLIE 
Raymond? Darling, what were you going to do, make me stand out there like room service? -- soft curves conceal razor claws and titanium backbone -- she kisses her son on the lips, straightens his collar, his tie, lets her hands smooth his shirt to his chest for a little too long, and never stops talking: 
You gave them every opportunity to do the right thing, Senator. 
ELLIE 
(glances at him) No. I gave them one opportunity. And that was unusually generous of me. She pushes through a door, and into -- 
48   INT. CONVENTION BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                       48 
Raymond's speech plays, low, on a television, and half a dozen DELEGATES and POWER PLAYERS with "Arthur For President" buttons grimly watch Ellie breeze in. Party Chairman VAUGHN UTLY anticipates her: 
UTLY 
The decision is final, Senator. Tom Jordan is on the ticket. We don't need your blessing, but we'd like it. 
ELLIE 
(smiling:) Before we get started, I'm dying to know: which genius here hatched the scheme of pairing a Sound Bite from Nebraska with a relic who thinks keeping suicide bombers off our busses is unconstitutional? 
UTLY 
All the research indicates that an Arthur- Jordan ticket sits quite well with the American public and -- 
ELLIE 
'Sits quite well' translates into how many votes? 
SENATOR WELLS 
Your son is largely unknown outside of New York. His public service, his Congressional record, while commendable, is -- 
ELLIE 
My son is a war hero. 
CONGRESSMAN FLORES 
(cheerful) Governor Arthur has agreed to consider Raymond for a cabinet post. A cold silence.   Ellie stands -- 
ELLIE 
We didn't come here to have a discussion. 
UTLY                            ELLIE 
Senator --                          (to her posse) Did we come here to have a discussion? 
SENATOR WELLS 
Ellie, you don't have the votes to block this, or even push the nomination to a second ballot. 
ELLIE 
(ignores him) Even running against this cut-and-fold vice president, with his party's record of abysmal failure at home and abroad, Arthur is still unelectable without help. (cold, hard logic:) Consider. The Governor is a corn-belt candidate who -- scratch and sniff -- looks and smells alot like the kind of liberal-labor-intellectual Dukakis was, but without, thank God, the helmet. (beat) Assume our intrepid Arthur can carry the Northeast, plus his home ground, and California. We're still dead in the South, and Southwest, where they win by landslides. The mid-central is a toss- up. Tom Jordan actually becomes a liability in Florida because of his Castro-appeasement profile, and in the Carolinas, where he fumbles the military vote over his "terrorism isn't a war it's a social disease" nonsense. The room is surreally silent. Ellie spins and moves like a televangelist, preaching to the frightened faithful. 
ELLIE 
You know this. Your own polls and surveys back me up. (beat) You're counting on Jordan to help you get the black vote, women, college kids -- my gut instinct says he won't -- and Arthur holding the center -- where he's soft at best. And who's to say the President won't throw troops into another third- world skirmish, pushing his sidekick's approval ratings up into the eighties again, and the campaign off the front pages? 
UTLY 
We're confident this is a winning ticket, Ellie. 
ELLIE 
What's your margin of error? Five points? Three? (beat) I can swing that, and you know it. I can swing seven away from you -- more than enough to split the party and -- 
SENATOR WELLS 
(over her) -- and deny us the White House for four more years? No. Not even you would do that, Senator. You're bluffing. Ellie stares at them. OUTSIDE, SUDDENLY: the marching band begins playing "It's a Grand Old Flag," and hurries out onto the ROARING convention floor ... 
ELLIE 
America is facing the greatest test of its history, gentlemen. Not just from terrorist organizations both outside and within our borders, but from covert alliances of disaffected nations so terrified of winding up on our shit list they believe the only way to protect themselves is to hit us with everything they can find before we get around to them. Am I the only one in this room paying attention to the NSA reports? We are on the brink of nuclear cataclysm, on our own soil, while our policies remain shackled by Jordan-style One Worlders who insist that human beings are essentially Good ... and that Power is something shameful, and Evil. (then) Make no mistake, the people of this great country are frightened. They know what's coming. They can feel it. And we can shovel them the same old shit and call it sugar, or arm them, with a young, vibrant, populist congressman, a war hero with heart -- forged by enemy fire, in the desert, in the dark, when American lives hung in the balance.

Raymond Shaw bears the lineage of the fabled Prentiss family dynasty -- grandson of legendary industrialist and diplomat Tyler Prentiss, son of controversial Senator Eleanor Prentiss Shaw, who took over the seat vacated by her husband, the esteemed John Shaw, when he died tragically over twenty years ago.

And at the instant he completes this, or any task, Raymond has already forgotten that he has ever been involved in it.

Yes sir. (beat) No sir. Beat.   Howard looks up at Marco. 
MARCO 
The meds make me ... spongy.   I float. I'm not sharp -- 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
The meds help you sleep. 
MARCO 
When I sleep, I dream.   I don't want to dream, sir. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
You're off your meds, sleep-deprived, you have an unexpected encounter with a member of your Gulf War recon team, Al Melvin, who mentions some dreams he's been having -- 
MARCO 
Dreams like mine. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
(ignores) -- and suddenly your own bad dreams come charging back. Made worse by your chronic fear of them. Add in all the recent campaign news about Congressman Shaw, which is obviously rekindling your feelings of guilt and jealousy -- 
MARCO 
-- I'm not jealous of Raymond Shaw, sir. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
Okay. How did you feel when you heard the news from the convention? Marco shrugs. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
A shrug isn't a feeling. 
MARCO 
I felt ... fine.     No big deal. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
Fine. 
MARCO 
Yes. (almost angry) Glad for him. He deserves it. Raymond Shaw is probably the kindest, bravest, warmest --

LT. COL. HOWARD 
You're fucking with me, Major. 
MARCO 
No sir.     I wouldn't do that, sir. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
What other conclusion can I draw? Marco says nothing.    Holding back what he's thinking. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
Look, we've been over this a million times. Until you forgive yourself for what happened that night in Kuwait, the loss of your men -- for what you did, for what you didn't do ... No reaction from Marco.    The Lt. Colonel sighs. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
How's Public Affairs? 
MARCO 
It sucks, sir. I want to get back to Intelligence. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
Then for God's sake, Ben, go back on your meds. And stay on them, this time. Get some sleep. I'll see you in two weeks. 
MARCO 
Yes sir.    Same time, same station. 
Marco starts to get up -- 
DONOVAN                           ELLIE 
One and the same.                     (teasing) They're desperate to be of service to you, Raymond. 
RAYMOND 
Go away, mother. You've earned your fee. Raymond flashes a dazzling Kennedyesque smile, as the men chuckle appreciatively. 
ELLIE 
The plucky idealist. 
Ellie glides off, unfazed.    The men banter on: 
RAYMOND 
Gentlemen, how's business? 
WHITING 
Good, Raymond. Business is good. 
JOHNSTON 
Could always be better. 
RAYMOND 
Careful. Any better, you'll be a monopoly. 
DONOVAN 
There's the challenge. Maximizing the market share and potential of a company. 
WHITING 
Or a country. Off their shared, collegial laughter -- 
ACROSS THE ROOM - MARCO - MONETS LATER 
watches Raymond take his leave from the Manchurian Global guys -- while, at the bar, the generals have established their beachhead of Bloody Marys with a couple of younger men in NAVY WHITES: 
REAR ADMIRAL GLICK 
Every great civilization has been anchored by a great Navy. 
GENERAL SLOAN 
Bullshit. You guys are sea chum, ripe for some raghead with a rocket launcher to put a hole in your bucket. Marco laughs deliberately, trying to diffuse the tension. 
MARCO 
(low) If you can't behave yourselves, Generals, we're gonna spend the rest of the day watching the Orioles game back at the hotel. Whereupon Raymond parades past, with his Secret Service handlers, oblivious to Ben until he calls out. 
MARCO 
Congressman -- Sergeant Shaw -- Raymond turning, but not stopping -- 
MARCO 
Ben Marco. 
RAYMOND 
I know. (strange, dreamy) Hello Captain. 
MARCO                              RAYMOND 
It's Major, and --                     (as if it surprises him:) I need to talk to you. But he keeps walking -- 
MARCO 
-- okay. -- Marco frowns, watches Raymond weave through the crowd towards Jocie, at the entrance. Marco follows, passing: 
ELLIE AND JORDAN 
locked in fierce, low battle, off to one side, voices hard, rising out of the din: 
JORDAN 
-- the political extortion you committed in order to destroy my vice presidential bid so that -- 
ELLIE 
Tom. 
JORDAN 
-- so that you might vicariously bask in reflected limelight from your son -- 
ELLIE 
(overlapping) Tom, please, just because the party felt a younger, more dynamic man could help the ticket, I don't think it's fair for you to single me out and -- 
JORDAN 
You know, I have such contempt for you, Eleanor, that when I think of you, I actually fear for this country. Raymond is nothing. A riddle. A wild card at worst. But you, you are the smiler who wraps her dagger in the cloak of the flag and waits for her chance to strike. Which I pray will never come. He wheels away --

JOCELYN 
... but Raymond, my God, it's been so many years -- I've been married and divorced -- 
RAYMOND 
I've changed too. 
JOCELYN 
That's not what I -- but, yes, it's great, really -- I see that you have -- congratulations -- 
RAYMOND 
(from notes he's made) Owens died of cancer in '97. Villalobos, a car crash. Atkins committed suicide. Jamison was at the Pentagon, 9-11, body never recovered. Wilson I'm still trying to track down. Garret and Howard trade looks. 
MARCO 
Sir, I know I can't ask you to talk to Congressman Shaw, not yet, but Al Melvin, it's a phone call, a quick q&a -- look at his notebooks, hear what he's been dreaming -- and either he will support the credibility of what I'm saying, or he won't. And I'll shut up. 
COLONEL GARRET 
And what is it you are saying, exactly, Major? That you misrepresented -- falsified -- what happened In Kuwait? About the Medal of Honor? In effect, committed perjury. 
MARCO 
If you just talk to Melvin -- 
COLONEL GARRET 
(ignores) -- No, no, I'm sorry -- you're saying an entire squad of U.S. Army soldiers was hypnotized into believing that Raymond Shaw deserved the Medal of Honor. And somehow you're the only one who knows the truth. Silence.   Marco looks down at his hands. 
COLONEL GARRET 
Major Marco. You will stay clear of Congressman Shaw. 
MARCO 
Yes sir. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
And you will resume your meds, Major. That is an order. 
MARCO 
Yes sir. Beat.   Marco stands up, to leave, but -- 
COLONEL GARRET 
Major, do you ever take a step back and consider why you've remained at rank for all these years? Missed Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraqi Freedom. While men of lesser promise and inferior talent have enjoyed the fruits of those campaigns and moved beyond you? 
MARCO 
Every day, sir.

At the far end of a long and gloomy hallway, we can see Marco arrive at the door to Melvin's room. He hesitates, then knocks -- 
MARCO 
Al?   Al Melvin, it's Marco ... Nothing. He looks at his watch, turns, walks back down the narrow, high-ceilinged corridor -- haunting sounds of radios and televisions and broken conversations -- he disappears down the stairs -- 
73   INT. FANCY HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              73

A THICK PANEL in the back wall just being unmoored -- the RUSHING ROAR of a sandstorm and -- 
A MAN IN BLACK 
steps through, gloves and soft-soled shoes. Raymond just watching as he places a small clam-shell video screen open on the counter -- we can SEE a B&W surveillance view of the CORRIDOR OUTSIDE RAYMOND'S ROOM, with Anderson sitting the night watch, reading. The man gestures Raymond through the closet passageway -- 
80   INT. A HUGE ROOM BESIDE RAYMOND'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS          80

He's entered some kind of portable, surreal operating theater, filled with monitoring device and computers ... a one-way video-conference camera is aimed at a big examination chair in one corner, surrounded by I.V. racks and more techno-medical equipment. The man who is obviously in charge here, starts a digital timer and turns to face Raymond. It's NOYLE. 
NOYLE 
Hello Raymond. Do you remember me? 
RAYMOND 
No sir. 
NOYLE 
Brilliant. (to his group) We have twenty minutes for our little check up from the neck up.

MARCO 
My God. I'm sorry to hear that. When did it ... (listens) Yeah, I know. I know. (deep breath) Listen, Mrs. Wilson -- can you tell me if Nathan was ever -- preoccupied -- with his experience in Kuwait? Did he ever mention dreams or nightmares ... about what happened ... the firefight, afterward ... (beat) -- uh-huh. Sure. No, I understand. (beat) Thank you for -- Dial tone.   He hangs up.

Raymond sits in a chair, rigged up with wires and tubes (much like he was ten years ago) -- a TRANSLUCENT BOX around his face overlaid with a METRIC GRID, his head held motionless by a semi-circular BRACE, curved calibration offering precise positioning for a MICRO-DRILL that Noyle moves into place -- and then a long, tiny drill bit WHIRS DOWN through STERILE LATEX stretched very tight across Raymond's head -- -- and plunges precisely and effortlessly through Raymond's skull, then STOPS -- he has no reaction, feels nothing -- LCD screens -- show a VIRTUAL MAP OF RAYMOND'S BRAIN, in a full range of primary colors -- sections morphing as thoughts and memories race through his mind, as MINISCULE, INTERWOVEN WIRES -- are threaded down through the HOLLOW core of the surgical drill, deep into Raymond's brain. Noyle plays to one of the cameras: 
NOYLE 
No decay, no slippage. Everything appears to be in flawless working condition. (then) Raymond can you remember the deaths of Mavole and Baker? 
RAYMOND 
Yes. The LCD SCREENS show activity in areas of Raymond's brain. 
NOYLE 
Describe it.

Marco has a PENLIGHT -- he turns it on, sweeps in front of him with its weak beam: THE ROOM -- stacked floor to ceiling with old newspapers, magazines, and HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF NOTEBOOKS, covering nearly every available surface. Marco picks up a notebook.    Moves to a desk and sits.   Opens the book --

Business? 
MARCO 
No. Guy I knew ... in the Army. He's in politics now. We've kinda lost touch. (awkward beat, then) What's your name? 
ROSIE

Yeah.   Crazy French pronunciation and all.

ROSIE 
Not yet they haven't, thank God.   But you can call me Jenny. 
MARCO 
What do your friends call you? 
ROSIE 
Rosie. My full name is Eugenie Rose. I've always liked the Rosie part better. Eugenie is, well, fragile. 
MARCO 
Still. When I asked you your name, you said it was Eugenie. 
ROSIE 
Yeah. Well. Maybe 'cause I was feeling fragile. At the time. Beat.   Their eyes lock.   Marco blinks -- FB94   FLASH: PFC. BOBBY BAKER -- stares back at him from where   FB94 Rosie was sitting. Bullet hole in his forehead and a small, lost smile. Reaching out to him --

ROSIE -- as before.    Slight look of puzzlement, because -- MARCO -- is on his feet, rattled, moving out to the aisle --

Marco reaches into his pocket for a plastic vial of medicine. Tries to shake one of the TINY PILLS OUT, but -- A BURLY PASSENGER in the bathroom emerges and the door SMACKS Marco hard across the back -- -- THE PILLS scatter onto the floor --

Sorry. I didn't know you          It's okay.     It's okay. were -- -- Marco's DOWN ON HIS KNEES, struggling to gather the pills together and put them back in the plastic vial. The big man goes. 
ROSIE 
sinks down next to him.   Calm.   Deftly plucking the pills from the floor. 
ROSIE 
My mother would tell you to wash these. Marco looks up at her blankly.    She takes the vial, caps it, gives it back. 
ROSIE 
I didn't mean to upset you. 
MARCO 
It's not you, it's me. I'm not -- my head -- (gestures uselessly) -- nothing's ... (stares at her) I wish I smoked. 
ROSIE 
It's way overrated. They stare at each other.   Then: 
MARCO 
Rosie, I'm gonna go in here, wash my face, take my pill, and get myself together. Marco ducks into the bathroom and shuts the door.

Marco cups water in his hands and smears it on his face, wiping it away with a paper towel. He comes up looking in the mirror, avoiding his own gaze as -- 
IN THE MIRROR: THE DOOR OPENS 
and a man comes partway in -- now it's Dr. Noyle. Marco pivots -- no Noyle. The door is shut, locked.      He's all alone. Losing his mind.

Raymond and Marco in the back seat facing forward. Anderson and campaign handler MIRELLA FREEMAN sit facing them, talking low, on a cell phone, as: 
RAYMOND 
I saw Mavole's Mom and Dad in St. Louis. I still visit them -- and Baker's mom -- when I can. Do you keep up with anybody from the unit besides Al Melvin? 
MARCO 
I don't keep up with Al Melvin.     He found me. 
RAYMOND 
Why did you ask me about Kuwait? 
MARCO 
(pleasantly:) I didn't. I asked you about your dreams. At the fundraiser -- why did you say you needed to talk to me? 
MIRELLA 
(covers the phone) Mr. Shaw, excuse me -- they want to know if you'll do an interview with Larry King at six. 
RAYMOND 
No. (to Marco) What do you want from me, Captain? 
MARCO 
Major.   Forty minutes of your time. 
MIRELLA 
No to the interview, or no to six? 
RAYMOND 
He wants to talk about my mother.     No. He looks at Marco -- 
MARCO 
Private time. 
RAYMOND 
Well, we've got about five minutes, right now. And this is as private as it gets for me anymore, so ... Beat.   He waits.   Anderson staring at Marco. 
MARCO 
There are these dreams that ... some of the men in our unit have been having. 
RAYMOND 
Including you? 
MARCO 
It's a question of what actually happened the night our patrol was attacked -- 
RAYMOND 
That's easy. (almost automatic) RPG incoming. Mortar fire, we're ambushed. Total chaos. I can't locate Baker or Mavole. You're knocked unconscious -- I find you and pull you to safety and then -- 
MARCO 
(cuts him off) -- Yeah, that's how I remember it, too. (beat) But I dream something else. The limo pulls to a curb -- 
118   EXT. ARTHUR/SHAW N.Y. CAMPAIGN OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON      118 
Through the windows SEE a crowded clutter of desks, phone volunteers, stacks of pamphlets. A giant SECURE TOMORROW logo looms above, flanked by beaming likenesses of Robert Arthur and Raymond Shaw. Anderson comes out and opens the limo door for Raymond. Marco struggles out behind him: 
RAYMOND 
Am I in your dreams? 
MARCO 
Yeah. 
RAYMOND 
Doing what? 
MARCO 
(evasive) -- You know. Raymond steps just outside the entrance to his office. 
RAYMOND 
Saving everybody? PEDESTRIANS pass between them on the crowded sidewalk. 
MARCO 
It's more complicated than that. Marco reaches into his folder, pulls out one of Melvin's notebooks -- 
MARCO 
People just don't have the same dreams accidentally -- (holds out the notebook) -- Melvin made drawings, he wrote down what he dreamed, this is one of his notebooks -- it's all in here. -- and Raymond's staring at the notebook without taking it, the way Marco once did with Melvin. Anderson and Mirella -- the staffers in the office -- are all staring at Marco the same way the Boy Scouts once stared at Melvin. 
RAYMOND 
I don't have dreams, Captain. (then, gently:) Maybe you should ... see somebody -- talk to somebody who specializes in this kind of thing -- 
MARCO 
I've been to doctors. ... which is exactly what Melvin said to him. 
MARCO 
Okay.   Okay, I'm sorry. Marco nods again, numb, makes a vague resigned gesture. 
MARCO 
RAYMOND 
I'm sure the press would have a field day with that. 
MARCO 
Raymond. They put an implant in me. I found it yesterday. Maybe they put one in you. 
RAYMOND 
(horrified) Nobody's put anything in me. 
MARCO 
Great. Let's prove it. We can go get an x-ray -- we can check it right now -- Marco moves toward him, Raymond backs away -- 
RAYMOND 
I want to be supportive of you, Ben, I do, but -- 
MARCO 
Just check your back, Raymond -- 
RAYMOND 
-- this can wait until after the election. 
MARCO 
What are you afraid of?   See if there's a bump. 
RAYMOND 
You should leave.   This is not, this is not -- 
MARCO 
-- just check -- 
RAYMOND 
(without checking) There's nothing there! Marco LUNGES at Raymond -- they fall, together, over the desk, onto the floor -- Chinese food scattering. 
MARCO 
Somebody was in your head, with big steel- toe boots, a couple of cable cutters and a chainsaw, and they went to town! Neurons got wasted, circuits rewired, brain cells obliterated -- KNOCKING at the door: 
ANDERSON (O.S.) 
Congressman Shaw? 
MARCO 
-- you don't even know what they did! You don't -- you can't CONCEIVE what they did to you -- and you're worried about some lame-ass reporters!? -- where Marco (stronger, better-trained) wraps Raymond in a headlock, RIPS Raymond's shirt from the shoulder -- 
MARCO 
If I'm wrong they can put me the fuck away -- 
ANDERSON (O.S.) 
-- are you okay? 
RAYMOND 
Ben -- 
MARCO 
-- there -- there's -- something -- INSISTENT KNOCKING at the door. Marco CLAWS AT THE SKIN on RAYMOND'S BACK -- sinks his teeth in -- -- Raymond shakes him off, and MARCO slams into the wall. The office door BANGS open -- Anderson and other agents SWARM Marco -- there's blood smeared on Marco's mouth, his jaws are clenched -- 
ANDERSON 
(disbelief) He bit him. (at Raymond) Sir, did he bite you? 
RAYMOND 
No. MARCO -- shoved to the floor -- twisted -- handcuffed -- blood SMEARING across the carpet -- his eyes wild with adrenaline and fear -- RAYMOND -- his hand goes to his back -- his eyes LOCK with Marco's for an instant -- then Marco is hustled out the door. 
ANDERSON 
Sir -- 
RAYMOND 
NOTHING HAPPENED! 
Horrified campaign workers crane necks to see inside. Mute with shock, Raymond pulls his hand away from his back. Hides the blood.

Raymond and Ellie. Through the wavy glass we see a crowded dining room, the ever-present Secret Service. 
RAYMOND 
No. That'd be political suicide. Of course not. I want you to help him. 
ELLIE 
I can't even imagine why. 
RAYMOND 
Because I feel sorry for him.   Because I said I would. 
ELLIE 
MARCO 
Yeah.   Kinda like 'special agent.' 
COLONEL GARRET 
Cut it out, Major. 
AGENT GOLDRING 
What's your obsession with Raymond Shaw? 
AGENT RAMIREZ 
Man of his dreams. 
MARCO 
Listen, you might want to advise your ME to check for an implant in Corporal Melvin's back -- under the skin, just shy of the scapula, left side ... if he's not looking for it, he won't find it. Implant.   The Feds just stare at him.   Like he's nuts. 
MARCO 
I didn't have anything to do with Corporal Melvin's death. 
AGENT JONAS 
Yeah, well, that's your opinion, but judging from your file here, apparently you don't know your shit from your oatmeal, my friend -- Marco snaps, spins out of his chair and lunges at Jonas -- Lt. Col. Howard and the other agents step between the two men -- pull them apart -- 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
(re: Jonas) Get this man out of here. 
AGENT JONAS 
(taunting Marco) Go ahead, nutball. Try it. Marco PUNCHES the agent so hard it knocks him down to the floor between the other two. 
AGENT JONAS

MARCO 
He said I could. Colonel Garret shoves Marco back into a chair, stays in the middle of the fracas, while -- 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
Okay, OKAY --! That's enough. Gentlemen, I need a moment with Major Marco. Now. The Federal Agents retreat with their bloodied-nose, cold- cocked colleague, door slamming behind them. 
ELLIE (V.O.) 
Evidently this has been going on for years ... Only Agent Volk remains, unmoved by what just occurred. CLOSE ON - MARCO, catching his breath. 
ELLIE (V.O.) 
... Sad little Tin Soldier. 
124   INT. ELEGANT RESTAURANT - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY                  124 
Ellie eats, while Raymond flips through Marco's extensive file: cross-agency surveillance, Army psychological profiling, FBI updates. Repeated buzzwords like: "mentally unstable," "obsessed with Raymond Shaw," "delusional," "borderline functional," "acute stress disorder ..." 
ELLIE 
Isn't it disgraceful the way troubled individuals are allowed to simply walk around with the rest of us until something horrible happens? Another failure of the HMOs. I'm thinking of sponsoring a bill, with Senator Friedman of Rhode Island -- 
RAYMOND 
-- I don't care. 
ELLIE 
Well, imagine how terrified your people were yesterday when Major Marco showed up at the airport and you invited him -- my God, invited him -- to tag along. Knowing what they knew. 
RAYMOND 
I know him. I served under him.   He was a good man. 
ELLIE 
That's what the neighbors always say about serial killers. Raymond stares at an old PHOTOGRAPH OF MARCO: curled up in a fetal position, on a V.A. hospital bed. 
ELLIE 
(sighs) Perhaps we could arrange a promotion to a less stressful posting. Somewhere tropical. 
125   INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                  125 
Marco with Howard, who's visibly upset. He likes Marco, it breaks his heart to watch him unravelling like this. Agent Volk remains in her chair, on the other side of the room: The door opens, and Col. Garret comes in, with Agent Goldring, who gives Marco back his personal effects, and: 
AGENT GOLDRING 
Goodbye. (to Marco) Get out of here. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
He's free to go? 
AGENT GOLDRING 
Shaw won't press charges, and he's got juice with important friends. It's today's daily double. Agent Volk closes her notebook and moves past Goldring as he picks up the tape recorder. She glances at Howard, and leaves the room. 
COLONEL GARRET 
Someone from Senator Eleanor Shaw's office called and intervened on your behalf. A beat.   Marco, trying to process all this: 
COLONEL GARRET 
Major, you have reached the terminal end of the Army's patience. You're relieved of duty, effective immediately. 
LT. COL. HOWARD 
There's a young neurologist at Walter Reed. Zahn. He's had considerable success with GWS -- I want you to get your affairs in order and report to him 
(MORE) 
LT. COL. HOWARD (CONT'D) 
for evaluation and treatment first thing Monday morning. 
I'm putting you on a cocktail of methohexitol to take the edge off. 
MARCO 
Edge off what? 
DELP 
'Getting clarity.' Or whatever you want to call it -- ECT not being the precise science that, say, leeching is. Wires snake across the floor to the ECT [Electro-Convulsive Therapy] unit. 
MARCO 
You don't think this is going to work. 
DELP 
It's the desperation move, man. But, hey. There is a school of thought, says a victim of induced abreaction -- or ultra-paradoxical brain activity, if you're at all correct about what happened to you -- can have it effectively dispersed by electroshock. Unscrambled. 
MARCO 
-- But? 
DELP 
But the legions of naysayers will tell you that if the initial work's done correctly -- if the brain's been not just washed, but dry-cleaned -- Takes out a bite-guard and puts it in Marco's mouth: 
DELP 
-- fuhgetaboutit. No sale. (then) Try to relax, okay? He throws the switch, sending electric current through Marco's head -- -- Marco's body ARCHES off the table and he goes into seizure --

130   EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY                                          130 
Marco opens his eyes to the glare of a crisp autumn sun, surreal colors: blue sky, shimmering green, the skyline. His head is in Rosie's lap, he lies curled in the grass. A banana-yellow motorized model plane buzzes in tight circles overhead. 
Rosie's talking, but Ben can't hear her.    Just the buzzing. She stops, looks at him. 
ROSIE 
Blank again? Marco tries to say something, his mouth is dry. 
ROSIE 
He said this would happen. Marco stares, trying to orient himself. His arm comes up to shade his eyes -- nothing written on it. 
MARCO 
Who? 
ROSIE 
Your friend. 
MARCO 
I don't remember a friend. Nothing. 
ROSIE 
Kind of like a computer system crash -- your brain goes down, then you boot up again, but you lose all your RAM. (hesitates) Do you remember me? 
MARCO 
(after a beat) Eugenie Rose. Rosie smiles.     Marco closes his eyes again and -- 
SCREEN GOES BLACK. 
Silence.   Two beats. Then the SOUND OF A TELEVISION fades up:

Rosie comes out of the bathroom, wearing a long New York Rangers jersey, bare-legged, barefoot, hair wet from a shower. Beautiful. 
MARCO 
It's Wednesday. 
ROSIE 
Yes. 
MARCO 
Central Park was Monday.   I came home Friday. 
ROSIE 
(smiles) That's right. A long beat. Marco stares at the t.v. as she sits on the edge of the bed, rubs her hair with a towel. 
MARCO

A CARETAKER rattling keys impatiently behind him, Marco stands looking down into the pit of the abandoned lab. Delp and the monkeys are gone. Empty cages and unplugged equipment are all that remain of Delp and his fear project. The utter quiet is deafening. 
139   EXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY                                    139 
Marco moving, head down, eyes everywhere -- anybody could be following him. Anybody could be watching him. Anybody could be part of this. PRELAP sound of a tape fast-forwarding and:

142   INT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DEEP IN THE STACKS - DAY       142 
Marco deep in research, at a small table covered with books and paper -- a crazy man's kind of chaos. The file he stole from Rosie's is disemboweled across the desktop. A library tape machine plays one of the surveillance tapes he's stolen from Rosie's: 
MARCO'S VOICE 
(bleeding through earphones) What else did we talk about? 
INTERCUT - MICROFICHE 
stories flip past ... 
ROSIE'S VOICE 
Raymond Shaw. And about what happened to you, after you were captured. Black helicopters, secret laboratories, mind drugs, mad scientists, shock-torture ... 
MARCO'S VOICE 
You don't believe any of it. 
ROSIE'S VOICE 
It's crazy. It sounds crazy. 
MARCO'S VOICE

Marco, on the bed, numb. 
MARCO 
And I think they made me kill someone too. One of my people. Kid named Bobby Baker. Rosie puts her arms around him --

Marco takes his thumb off the shuttle button and -- 
MARCO'S VOICE 
... We were all hooked up to IV tubes and wires and equipment -- heart monitors, head monitors, electroshock -- and a lot of stuff I've never seen before ... ... Finding, finally, an inside page of the SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY section of the Times, with the headline: 
MANCHURIAN HOPES NEW IMPLANTS SAVE LIVES 
... and a p.r. PHOTO of Managing Director David R. Donovan, smiling, flanked by a TEAM OF SCIENTISTS. The caption only mentions Donovan by name -- in the picture his hand is extended, he's got a tiny implant device cupped in his palm. 
ROSIE'S VOICE 
Did he have a name? 
MARCO'S VOICE 
What? Marco stares at the photograph. 
PANNING TIGHT - ACROSS THE SCIENTISTS 
in the b.g. of the photograph.    HOLDING on one, half-hidden, just slightly out of focus. It's Noyle. 
ROSIE'S VOICE 
The doctor, Ben -- what was his name? Can you remember? A long beat.   Marco racks his memory.   Then --

Noyle.   They called him Dr. Noyle. PUSH in until Noyle is just a mass of pixels -- 
CRASH:

A Google search.   Marco types the name: NOYLE. 
INTERCUT - COMPUTER SCREEN 
A GOVERNMENT website: 
An argument in progress as Raymond shrugs off his overcoat into the hands of a SERVANT. The low murmur of Jordan's voice, then INCREDULOUS LAUGHTER: 
ELLIE (O.S.) 
Lies. Fabrications. Fiction. You've been waiting to do this to me for, what, twenty years? Get out. 
JORDAN (O.S.) 
No, I'll wait until Raymond gets here and we can all -- 
ELLIE (O.S.) 
Get out of my house. Raymond proceeds down the hallway to --

Raymond entering, closing the door behind him as Ellie throws documents across the room at Jordan: 
ELLIE 
The man is insane, Tom -- full-blown schizophrenia -- he's been stalking Raymond -- if you dare to use this -- Now they see Raymond, under the imposing Andrew Wyeth painting of Tyler Prentiss that dominates one whole wall of the study, and Ellie stops. 
ELLIE 
(to Raymond) Your bipolar buddy has been sharing his dreams with Senator Jordan. 
JORDAN 
Hello Raymond. Raymond smiles -- it's terrifying -- the fragile, forced, frigid smile of a man in pain. 
RAYMOND 
Hello Senator. How's Jocie? Jordan picks up a picture of Noyle and smoothes it onto the desk for Raymond to see, as: 
ELLIE 
Can we please not go down that road? 
JORDAN 
Do you recognize this man? 
RAYMOND 
No. 
JORDAN 
His name is Atticus Noyle. He is a South African physician, neuropsychiatric scientist and mercenary -- someone our CIA trained for covert mind warfare against the Soviets in Aghanistan -- someone who has sold technology to and done research for terrorist groups, and rogue states. Major Marco claims that this man -- 
ELLIE                           JORDAN 
-- brainwashed you -- -- In his dreams. 
RAYMOND 
Sir, Ben Marco is sick.   Delusional. 
JORDAN 
Nevertheless he's pulled from his mad hat some remarkably lucid connections between his dreams of your exploits in Kuwait, and this Dr. Noyle, and the private equity fund Manchurian Global -- Raymond frowns, looks from Jordan to Ellie. 
JORDAN 
-- your mother's primary political benefactor for the past fifteen years. 
ELLIE 
Christ, Tom. They contribute to half the Senate, for God's sake. Silence. 
RAYMOND 
I don't understand. 
JORDAN 
At the time of Desert Storm, Dr. Atticus Noyle was working under a research grant from Manchurian Global. Your mother's friend. The color suddenly drains out of Ellie's face. 
RAYMOND 
What? 
JORDAN 
Rogue scientists. Mind control. Manchurian Global. Your mother. You. Connect the dots, Raymond. Possibly, your mother's blind to them, because they pay their way -- 
ELLIE 
Possibly the Senator's motives are colored by his desperation to get himself back on the presidential ticket now that the heavy lifting is done -- 
RAYMOND 
(unraveling) I don't -- I don't -- 
JORDAN 
It's not about me. As far as I'm concerned, this should never come out -- it would shred what little remains of the fabric of our public trust -- think of the nation -- 
RAYMOND 
I don't have the dreams. 
ELLIE 
He can't prove anything. 
JORDAN 
Everything you stand for is upside down! If this were to come out, true or no, it would be catastrophic for the campaign. (beat, a threat?) And it will come out. 
RAYMOND 
What are you saying? Silence.   The question hangs there. 
RAYMOND 
What do I do? 
PULL SLOWLY BACK:

ELLIE 
... because, of course, the assassin -- the deranged, obsessed, tragically 
(MORE) 
ELLIE (CONT'D) 
paranoid, lone gunman -- is trying to kill you. 
RAYMOND 
The Major is an excellent marksman. She touches his bare shoulder, leaves her hand there. 
RAYMOND 
But what will happen to him? 
ELLIE 
(gentle) The assassin always dies, baby. It's necessary for the national healing. She takes his shirt off a hanger, he stands up, and she starts to dress him -- 
ELLIE 
I'm sure you will never entirely comprehend this, darling, and I know, the way you are right now, this is like trying to have a whimpered conversation with someone on a distant star ... but it must be said, Raymond -- I did this for you -- so that you could have what I could not, what your father didn't want -- what your grandfather dared to dream possible -- She runs her hands through his hair.   Tears fill her eyes. 
ELLIE 
-- when you ran away to join the Army, after that girl, after Jocie -- when you swore you'd never speak to me again, I felt your father's shadow pass across us, and I couldn't let him run you the way he ruined himself. (beat) That's when Mark Whiting came to me with talk of extraordinary scientific breakthroughs ... Attitude adjustment ... Reconciliation ... Greatness. So I let them take you, and change you. Not too much. Not so much that you'd notice. Just enough to bring you back to me. 
RAYMOND 
Yes, mother. 
ELLIE 
And look what you have, now! Look how far we've come! It's working, darling -- they think they own you, but they are very, very wrong. You're not something they can buy and sell, Raymond, not for 
(MORE) 
ELLIE (CONT'D) 
any price -- we're one, and there'll be no stopping us now, will there? We're going to save this country in the hour of its greatest need. Raymond is dazzled by Eddie's radiance. 
RAYMOND 
Yes, mother. She straightens his tie.   Her hands caress her son's shoulders. 
ELLIE 
How much you look like my father, now -- you have his hands, and you hold your head in the same proud way. And when you smile it's like I'm a little girl again, and -- (impulsively kisses him) When you smile -- when you smile -- Raymond moves to her -- their embrace is all consuming --

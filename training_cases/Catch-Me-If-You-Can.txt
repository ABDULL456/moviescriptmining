BLACK AND WHITE FOOTAGE FROM 1978 
MUSIC UP: A simple GAME SHOW SET -- one long desk-that houses four "CELEBRITY PANELISTS," a small pulpit with attached microphone for the host, BUD COLLYER, who walks through the curtain to the delight of the audience. Bud bows and waves to the celebrities -- ORSON BEAN, KITTY CARLISLE, TOM POSTON, and PEGGY CASS. 
BUD COLLYER Hello, panel, and welcome everyone to another exciting day on "To Tell The Truth." Let's get the show started. 
THE CURTAIN STARTS TO RISE BRIGHT LIGHTS SHINE on the faces of THREE MEN who walk toward center stage. All thre n wear identical AIRLINE PILOT UNIFORMS, each with m; c ng blue blazers and caps. (cont' d) Gentleman, please state your names. 
PILOT #1 My name is Frank Abagnale Jr. THE PILOT IN THE MIDDLE steps forward. 
PILOT #2 My name is Frank Abagnale Jr. THE THIRD PILOT does the same. 
PILOT #3 My name is Frank Abagnale Jr. Bud smiles, grabs a piece of paper.

PILOTS. BUD COLLYER (cont'd) 
(READING) From 1964 to 1966 I successfully impersonated an airline pilot for Pan Am Airlines, and flew over two million miles for free. During that time I was also the Chief Resident Pediatrician at a Georgia hospital, the Assistant Attorney General for the state of Louisiana, and a Professor of American History at a prestigious University in France. By the time I was caught and sentenced to prison, I had cashed over six million dollars in fraudulent checks in 26 foreign countries and all fifty states, and I did it all before my 18th birthday. To this day, I am the only teenager ever to have been placed on the FBI' s most wanted list. My name is a Abagna l e Jr. Warm applause as the THREE MEN walk behind a desk that faces the pa They all sit down at exactly the same time. 
BUD COLLY (cont'd ) Okay, panel, you have ork cut out for you. Kitty Carl , you have the first question. 
KITTY CARLISLE Imposter number one, how many years were you in prison? 
PILOT #1 I served two years in France, and five years in Atlanta, Georgia. 
KITTY CARLISLE Imposter number two, I find all this very fascinating. Who was it that finally caught you?

198 EXT. - PARIS STREETS 198 
JOE SHAYE (V.0.) When he gets to a new city he starts out slow, hitting the banks on the outskirts of town. At first it's small checks in small banks that pose little or no threat.

JOE SHA ï¿½1 There's always one ba 's bigger and richer than all the ers. This is what he came for, and he'll watch it for days. He'll know if they add a security-guard, or bring in a new teller. And if he sees anything out of place, a new cleaning man, a window shade that's up instead of down, he'll move on to the next one. That's the luxury of having the entire world as your mark.

Debbie Zane -

JOE SHAYE How do you know? 
FRANK Every bank uses hand stamps for the dates. They get used over and over, so they're always worn down, and the numbers are always cracking -- the sixes and nines go first. Look at the date on that check -- the ink is worn flat, the nines and sixes are cracking -- that's the stamp of a teller, Joe. Looks like you got yourself an inside job. 
SKYLINE. Look at me,

THE PROPOSAL

FADE IN: 
INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING 
The sun peeks over the horizon.   There's a stunning view of Central Park from this apartment, but whoever lives here isn't watching. As we wander through expensive furniture, a steady THUMP, THUMP, THUMP echoes through the apartment.   Eventually, we see MARGARET MILLS (37) running on a treadmill, watching "The O.C." on Tivo, and reading a manuscript. She sprints as the clock on her treadmill goes to zero.   As she hits a button to stop the treadmill... 
INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING 
A hand knocks an alarm clock off a table to shut it up.   RICHARD PAXTON (26) wakes up on pink sheets and looks around to figure out where he is. There are multiple framed pictures of the same model on the walls. Richard looks at the clock and gets up quickly when he sees it is 6:16 AM.   Unfortunately for him, he is very hung over. 
RICHARD Where are my clothes? A blob beneath the sheets next to him answers.   SIMONE is the model on the walls and is really, really hot. 
SIMONE In the kitchen.   I think.   Can I make you some coffee? 
RICHARD Sorry, I gotta go.   I'm late. Richard hurries to the kitchen.   Socks are on the butcher block next to an empty champagne bottle.   Shoes in the sink.   He finds his pants on the floor and puts them on. RICHARD (cont'd) Have you seen my belt? Simone looks around and sees it tied to her headboard. 
SIMONE In here. She unties the complicated knot.   Richard comes back half dressed.   He swallows a little throwup. 
RICHARD Baby, I just can't do this anymore. 
INT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING 
Margaret puts on a black suit jacket.   Definitely not off the rack.   She makes sure she looks perfect in the mirror, and moves off. 
INT. WOMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING 
Reflected in the mirror above Simone's bed, Richard hurriedly gets dressed as he talks. 
RICHARD You're just too much for me.   And I'm just another guy too wrapped up in his job. 
SIMONE Fine.   Whatever.   Just go. Richard sits down on the bed and locks eyes with Simone. 
RICHARD Let's not end it like that. It's been an amazing three and a half weeks.   Thank you. And you should know that you have the nicest ass I've ever been with. 
SIMONE 
(TOUCHED) You mean it? 
RICHARD I do.   It's magnificent. 
SIMONE I work really hard on it. 
RICHARD I know you do. Simone smiles and begins to seductively pull the sheets off her naked body.   Richard shakes his head "no" and smiles. RICHARD (cont'd) I really gotta go. 
INT. MARGARET'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING 
CRUNCH.   Margaret eats a bowl of Kashi and soy milk while standing and reading a manuscript.   Her eyes remain glued to her reading as she rinses out her bowl and puts it in the dishwasher. Her apartment is very quiet. 
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - MORNING 
HONK!   A cab blares its horn at Richard as he runs across the street.   His suit is rumpled and he checks his watch. 
INT. MARGARET'S LOBBY - MORNING 
DING!   The elevator opens and Margaret strides towards the exit and the DOORMAN (60).   Before Margaret gets to the door, her CELL PHONE RINGS.   She checks the caller ID and excitedly points at her phone as she lets it ring. 
MARGARET (to phone) I knew you would call!   Now come on, tell me what I want to hear.   Give it to me. 
DOORMAN You have to put it by your mouth so people can hear you. 
Margaret opens the door to her office, and finds Richard standing at attention with papers in one hand and coffee in the other. Her office looks perfect. 
RICHARD You've got a conference call in thirty, a staff meeting at nine, and your immigration lawyer sent some papers for you to sign. 
MARGARET Cancel the call, move the meeting to eight, 
(MORE) 
MARGARET (cont'd) (big news) I got Frank to do publicity. 
RICHARD Nice job. 
MARGARET When I want your praise, I'll ask for it. Is Bob here? 
RICHARD I'm sure.   You want him on the phone? 
MARGARET We're going to his office.   Grab your pad. Richard calmly backs out of the office... 
INT. RICHARD'S DESK - CONTINUOUS 
... but once he's out of Margaret's sight he runs to his computer and sends an instant message to the office "The Banshee is headed to Bob's office." 
INT. ROYCE PUBLISHING - MORNING 
As the message pops up on computers, the quiet office jumps to life as everyone in a cubicle picks up their phone and resumes their imaginary conversations. 
INT. RICHARD'S DESK - MORNING 
Margaret comes out to Richard's desk.   She notices his coffee cup with Jillian's number on it.   She takes special notice of the hearts that dot the "I's" in Jillian. 
MARGARET That's cute.   You gonna call her today? 
RICHARD What? Richard doesn't know what Margaret is talking about, until she nods at the cup.   He's embarrassed. 
MARGARET Are you bored here?   Do you need little distractions like that to get you through the day? 
RICHARD Uh... 
MARGARET You have another late night out? 
RICHARD 
Margaret starts walking.   Richard quickly catches up, worried because he doesn't know where she's going with this. 
MARGARET I'm firing on all cylinders and you've got hearts on your coffee cup, wicked bed head, and a wrinkled suit that you wore yesterday. 
RICHARD Oh.   Well, it won't be wrinkled for long. 
MARGARET You'll magically unwrinkle? 
RICHARD Yes. 
MARGARET You have magic pants? 
RICHARD No.   I've sprayed them with stuff that will take care of the wrinkles. 
MARGARET Does this work on more than just your pants? 
RICHARD Anything that's wrinkled. 
MARGARET Buy me some. 
RICHARD Will do. Richard makes a note.   Margaret stops to make her point. 
MARGARET I don't care what or who you do on your own time, but when you walk through that door you represent me, and I will not have your personal life affect you at work.   If you want me to think of promoting you to editor, I need you sharp, focused and professional. Got it? 
RICHARD Got it. 
MARGARET She tell you to quit? 
RICHARD No.   No. (off Margaret's look) Um.   Yes?   But as I've explained to them, after three years together, you're the only person on the planet who can make me editor, so that's the way it is. Richard's phone rings and he picks it up. 
RICHARD (cont'd) Your 10:55 is here.   Mr. Gilbertson? 
MARGARET Who is this guy? 
RICHARD He said you knew each other.   You weren't sure so you told me to set a meeting.   We rescheduled on him four times. 
MARGARET Go get him.   But he's out of here in five minutes, we've got work to do. Margaret leaves and goes into her office. 
RICHARD (to himself) I'll charge up the cattle prod. 
INT. MARGARET'S OFFICE - DAY 
Margaret reads as MR. GILBERTSON (48) sits down.   He's an intense man in a bad suit.   He sits in silence until Margaret looks up. 
MR. GILBERTSON Margaret.   Good to see you.   I know how busy you are.   Congrats on the promotion.   Read about it in P-W. 
MARGARET Yeah.   Well, those announcements are silly, aren't they?   Like everyone who needs to know doesn't know already. Margaret has been trying to figure out how she knows this man, but now gives up. MARGARET (cont'd) Have to admit, I can't place where we know each other from. Gilbertson smiles.   He didn't expect her to remember. 
MR. GILBERTSON Three years ago?   We worked together. 
MARGARET Don't have it... 
MR. GILBERTSON Remember "Dandelion's Desire?" Margaret gets excited. 
MARGARET Oh my God, you read that manuscript with me? That book is legend.   Without a doubt the worst ever written. 
MR. GILBERTSON You think? 
MARGARET It was a fever dream!                                         900 offensive and pointless pages, with like 30 characters, who all had some weird disability.   The paraplegic pornographer, and the stuttering scientist?   Oh!   And there was the asthmatic alien chapter -- written entirely in his alien language. 
MR. GILBERTSON I believe there was a glossary... Margaret laughs, caught up in the memory. 
MARGARET Did you see the pass letter I wrote him? 
MR. GILBERTSON 
(QUOTING) "Your grammar is impeccable, but please do not confuse superior form with writing ability.   Save your skills for the office newsletter, you sir, are no writer." A beat.   Margaret says matter of fact... 
MARGARET You wrote the book. 
MR. GILBERTSON I did. 
MARGARET You're Dante Dickens? 
MR. GILBERTSON One of my nom de plumes. Gilbertson paces.   Margaret stays seated, at a loss. 
MARGARET I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings.   You obviously were spending a lot of time writing, I just thought you should channel all that passion into something else. Gilbertson smiles as he pulls a BADGE from his coat pocket. 
MR. GILBERTSON Ms. Mills, I'm with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and I'm deporting you to Canada. 
MARGARET Excuse me?   What?   This is a mistake.   I've lived here since 1981.   I'm applying for citizenship. 
MR. GILBERTSON You need citizenship now?   After the big promotion? 
MARGARET Yes.   And all the papers are in. Gilbertson pulls out a stack of papers and throws them down. 
MR. GILBERTSON Well, my office is going to reject your paperwork on Monday, while we investigate whether your behavior is well disposed to the good order and happiness of the United States.   We must protect our sovereignty. 
MARGARET I'm a threat to the sovereignty of the United States? 
MR. GILBERTSON Yes, and unfortunately my investigation will take awhile, so you'll be deported while your case winds through the system. (as if he doesn't know) Will it affect you at work if you aren't allowed to enter the U.S. for the next two to three years? 
MARGARET "Affect me at work?"   I'll lose my job! 
INT. SEATTLE AIRPORT - DAY 
As they change planes in Seattle, Margaret walks quickly and talks on the phone.   Still the assistant, Richard lags behind, weighed down by both their bags. Up ahead at the gate, a GATE ATTENDANT (Female, 50's) ANNOUNCES final boarding to Sitka.   Margaret gets off her phone. 
MARGARET So what do I need to know up there?   Bullet points. 
RICHARD I told âem we've been dating for six months. We've kept it a secret from everyone... (under his breath) ...and that you're a naughty minx in the sack. Richard and Margaret make it to the attendant at the gate. Margaret is not amused by Richard's attempt at humor. 
MARGARET 
(VENOMOUS) Don't make me hate you. Margaret hands her boarding pass to the attendant and breezes through.   The attendant gives Richard a look. 
RICHARD Bringing her home to meet my folks.   She's 
Tangled in the bags, Richard struggles to find his boarding pass. The impatient attendant is getting frustrated. RICHARD (cont'd) I've got it here.   Sorry.   Guess I'm a little flustered too.   Haven't been home for awhile, hope they like her! The gate attendant smiles. 
GATE ATTENDANT (heard it all) I don't care, sir. Richard finds his boarding pass and hands it over. 
RICHARD OK then.   You're a sweet lady.   Thanks. Richard hustles to the plane as they shut the doors. 
INT. PLANE TO ALASKA - DAY 
Margaret takes her seat and sits next to a well dressed HANDSOME MAN who is READING A BOOK.   She notices the title and he catches her stare.   Margaret explains. 
MARGARET I'm sorry, I hate it when people stare at what I'm reading.   It's just... I worked on that book. 
HANDSOME MAN You wrote it? 
MARGARET Edited it.   It was one of my favorites. 
HANDSOME MAN Well you did a good job.   It's great. 
MARGARET You don't see many guys with that book. You, uh, read a lot of love stories about Roman concubines? 
HANDSOME MAN My ex-girlfriend gave it to me.   I travel a lot for work.   I'll read anything... 
MARGARET 
(SUSPICIOUS) Ex-girlfriend, huh? 
HANDSOME MAN (smiling, embarrassed) OK, you got me.   I'm a closet romantic.   But let's keep that between us. Margaret smiles and makes the "my lips are sealed" motion.   Just then, Richard lumbers onto the plane with the bags. 
MARGARET There you are.   Give me my lap top. Richard untangles the bags and gives Margaret her computer bag. 
RICHARD (re: book) Hey, he's reading... 
MARGARET I know, Richard. Richard turns around and puts the bags in the overhead compartment.   The Handsome Man turns to Margaret. 
HANDSOME MAN Did you two want to sit together? 
MARGARET Sit together with who? The Handsome man nods at Richard. 
HANDSOME MAN Your boyfriend? Margaret points to Richard indignantly. 
MARGARET You mean him? The Handsome man nods.   Margaret tries to set the record straight. MARGARET (cont'd) No.   No.   No.   He's my assistant. 
HANDSOME MAN You're bringing your assistant all the way to Alaska? Richard smiles, happy that Margaret has to answer. 
RICHARD Oh, you can tell him the truth. 
MARGARET Well, he's... indispensable. 
The Handsome man isn't buying it. MARGARET (cont'd) And gay.   Takes care of me everywhere I go. Call him my queen mother.   Aren't you my indispensable gay queen mother? Margaret shoots Richard a nasty look.   He has to go along. 
RICHARD That's me. Richard turns to close the overhead compartment. 
HANDSOME MAN You're awfully nice to fly him first class. Margaret nods her head and agrees.   It sucks to be Richard. 
MARGARET Surprise?   Another surprise? 
RICHARD She's not good with surprises. 
MARGARET I'm really not good with surprises. 
EXT. SITKA AIRPORT - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Debbie stops.   Sitka Airport is very small, so they are already outside by all the cars parked in the loading zone. Debbie and Annie excitedly look at each other. 
DEBBIE Well you two... 
GRANDMA ANNIE ...you're getting married this weekend! 
MARGARET                                                           RICHARD What?                                                              What? GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd) The whole kit and caboodle. Margaret gives both these women a look that says "what are you talking about?" 
DEBBIE When Gilber-something told us you were getting married... 
GRANDMA ANNIE 
DEBBIE ...God rest their souls... 
GRANDMA ANNIE ...or friends... 
DEBBIE ...we decided to give you a wedding. 
GRANDMA ANNIE Engagement party tonight... 
DEBBIE ...and the wedding tomorrow at midnight. Debbie and Annie wait to see what Margaret thinks. 
MARGARET Are you witches? 
GRANDMA ANNIE Just quaint.   During the solstice it's good luck.   It's an Alaskan thing. 
DEBBIE We've planned everything. Margaret isn't sold, so Grandma Annie goes for the clincher. 
GRANDMA ANNIE I'm old, Margaret.   I don't have much time left.   Richard lives so far away, and I never see him.   Now I find out he's getting married, and I have a chance to see my one grandchild's wedding day.   It's a dream come true for me.   A dream come true.   Please let me see Richard get married before I die. Please. Long beat.   Richard doesn't know what Margaret is going to say. Margaret doesn't know what Margaret is going to say.   Finally, she goes to speak, but can only get out... two big thumbs up. The crowd cheers. 
EXT. SITKA - DAY 
A procession of cars makes its way through town. 
INT. PICKUP - DAY 
Debbie and Grandma sit in the front of the truck, all smiles. Margaret and Richard sit as far away from each other as possible in the backseat of the extended cab. 
Margaret tries to get Richard's attention, but he's looking out the window.   Finally she pinches him and Richard jumps. He gives Margaret a "what did you do that for" look. 
MARGARET 
(MOUTHING) The Dragon Lady!? Richard shrugs. 
GRANDMA ANNIE To tell you the truth, we had a lot of the plans made already for my birthday.   Just a few changes here and there, and we made this weekend a wedding. Margaret stares at Richard. 
MARGARET I'm a lucky woman. Margaret does her best to smile. 
EXT. DOCK - DAY 
The cars park in a lot in the middle of nowhere, near a small dock.   Everyone gets out of the cars and starts walking to the ocean.   Margaret is confused. 
MARGARET I'm not getting out of this car until you tell me where we're going. 
RICHARD Come on, it'll be OK.   I promise. Richard points to a small island about a mile away. 
EXT. YACHT - DAY 
Everyone rides on a 75 foot yacht.   Lots of polished wood and chrome.   Someone passes out beers on board, and the mood is festive.   Margaret takes a look around at the surreal scene. 
DEBBIE I thought so dear. Debbie leaves and shuts the door.   Margaret reverts back to her old self. 
MARGARET I'm about 15 seconds from bitch. 
RICHARD Calm down. 
MARGARET What is going on here? 
RICHARD Hell if I know. 
MARGARET You had no idea they knew about us getting married? 
RICHARD You think I'd bring you here if I did? 
MARGARET Well, we just gotta tell âem. 
RICHARD Tell âem what? 
MARGARET Tell âem the truth.   About us. 
RICHARD Wrong answer.   No way. 
MARGARET What do you mean no way?   This is crazy. 
RICHARD No, crazy was lying to the federal officer. 
MARGARET Well I don't like this. 
RICHARD Well I'm not making my Gammy an accomplice to a Class C felony!   For one second could you not be so selfish? 
MARGARET Selfish? 
RICHARD Yeah, you know, that thing you do where you only worry about yourself every second of every day? 
MARGARET How is it selfish to tell the truth? 
RICHARD Look.   We're awful, awful people.   In the last forty eight hours, we've lied to... everyone.   We need to protect the people downstairs.   We can't ask these good, decent, not awful people to lie for us. Let's keep the darkside to ourselves. Margaret takes a second to make up her mind. 
MARGARET Fine.   But if we do this, you need to stop lying to me. 
RICHARD What've I lied to you about? 
MARGARET Why did you tell me that you were poor? 
RICHARD I never said that. 
MARGARET Well, you never told me you were rich. 
RICHARD When does that come up? 
MARGARET I don't know, how about, "Hi, my name is Richard, I'm an Alaskan titan of industry." 
RICHARD Well, maybe I didn't tell you because you would have fired me if you knew. 
MARGARET No I wouldn't. 
RICHARD Come on!   You're always yammering on about your scrappy childhood, and how you fought for those soccer scholarships, and how the rich kids made fun of you in prep school for working in the kitchen.   You're totally anti- rich. 
MARGARET I'm not anti-rich. 
RICHARD Oh yes you are!   And you know what makes it worse?   You have money! 
MARGARET I earned... 
RICHARD ...every penny I have.   Blah, blah, blah. You need new material. 
MARGARET Hey.   Watch it.   You're still my assistant. 
GERTRUDE I moved back about six months ago.   I'm teaching second grade.   At Baranof. 
RICHARD Did your husband move up here too? 
GERTRUDE Uh, no.   I, ah, got divorced. 
RICHARD Oh my God.   I'm sorry. 
GERTRUDE Me too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna meet the bride. Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret. 
GERTRUDE (cont'd) Hi, I'm Gertrude.   But call me Gert. 
MARGARET You're a Gertrude? 
GERTRUDE A family name from hell. 
MARGARET I'm sure it's been a curse. 
GEOFFREY Gert and Richard were quite the item in high school. Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence. 
GERTRUDE Oh Please.   Ancient history. 
GEOFFREY Feels like yesterday to me. 
GERTRUDE (ignoring Geoffrey) So tell me everything.   I hear it wasn't exactly love at first sight? 
MARGARET Not exactly... 
GRANDMA ANNIE Now Richard, what I want to know is how you proposed. This grabs the group's full attention.   Everyone loves to hear a story like this. 
RICHARD Well... Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude. RICHARD (cont'd) Uh, uh, um, I... 
GEOFFREY Yeah.   How did you pop the question? Richard is a deer in the headlights.   This is getting ugly. Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in. 
MARGARET Can I tell this one, honey? 
RICHARD Uh.   Sure. 
MARGARET I'm an early, early riser and go for a run everyday.   Well, it was our six month anniversary and I was out for my normal jog in the park, when who do I see in a horse drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So I ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his finger to his lips and says, "shhhh."   So there I am in my jogging clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him in a tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later, we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best part, we're the only people in the place because Richard got them to open up early. Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says "I didn't want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life, and that I would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry me?" The group is silent, waiting for the clincher. MARGARET (cont'd) I said yes. The group gives a collective "ahh".   Grandma Annie takes both Margaret and Richard by the hand. 
GRANDMA ANNIE You are a good boy Richard, and you make me very proud.   I love you Richy. 
RICHARD I love you too, Grandma. Grandma hugs the couple.   Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and Gertrude. 
GEOFFREY So did this happen before or after the INS agent came sniffing around? 
DEBBIE What is wrong with you?   I'm sorry Margaret. Margaret doesn't miss a beat. 
MARGARET Oh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my lawyers have been dealing with all of this. When you told us at the airport it was the first time I'd heard about it.   I'm so embarrassed. 
DEBBIE Don't be, dear.   Geoffrey's just an ass. While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink that says "I've got this under control".   The moment is interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear. 
RICHARD Margaret Mill's phone. (off answer) One second please. Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone. RICHARD (cont'd) It's our friend, Frank. Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem. 
MARGARET Excuse me, I'll just be a second. Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't notice Balzac follow her outside. 
EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear.   Balzac follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him. 
MARGARET Don't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the wishy washy writer who changes his mind every two seconds. Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking. Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear. MARGARET (cont'd) (to Balzac) Sit and be quiet! Balzac sits and pouts.   Margaret walks away and puts the phone back to her ear. 
MARGARET (cont'd) I fired Bob because he didn't have your best interest in mind.   Our job is to help you succeed.   He wasn't doing that. Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him peacefully sit in the grass. She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when -- WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and takes off.   Margaret jumps. There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle. She stays calm on the phone. MARGARET (cont'd) Could you hold on just a second? With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened. Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone and picks it up. MARGARET (cont'd) 
(NONCHALANT) Sorry, dropped my phone. Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in circles above her.   She decides to wrap up the call quick and get back to the house. MARGARET (cont'd) Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything. But know this.   This book is your legacy... Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac again.   She runs. MARGARET (cont'd) ... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me- tomorrow-with-your-decision.   My-phone is- always-on.   Talk-to-you-soon. The eagle bears down on them with talons out.   Just as the eagle is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs Margaret's phone and flies off.   Margaret freaks. MARGARET (cont'd) 
Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the eagle as an offering. MARGARET (cont'd) Take the dog!   Take the dog! 
MARGARET Want me to do it? 
GRANDMA ANNIE Thank you dear, but let's keep it our secret. 
EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - SHORELINE - DAY 
Snow capped mountains watch 20 MEN in short sleeves hit golf balls into the ocean.   Green pontoon rafts bob in the water, made up to look like golf greens.   Golf balls are stacked in pyramid formations at every hitting area. Richard comes down from the house to join the group.   Geoffrey jokes with MR. MAGUIRE (60's, good natured) as they hit balls. 
GEOFFREY ...yeah, Debbie found these eco-balls that dissolve in the water. 
MAGUIRE How does she come up with this shit? 
GEOFFREY She just does.   I stopped trying to figure out how. Geoffrey and Mr. Maguire see Richard coming their way.   Mr. Maguire yells at Richard like the old family friend he is. 
MAGUIRE 
(JOKING) I'm mad at you, son! 
RICHARD Why's that, Mr. Maguire? 
MAGUIRE You fly up here and don't call me? 
RICHARD Sorry âbout that. 
MAGUIRE What good is me owning an airline if I can't give you free tickets? 
RICHARD You're right.   Don't know what I was thinking... 
MAGUIRE Damn, straight.   Don't let it happen again! (hands Richard a golf club) Here, you take over.   This game is for pussies, I'm getting a drink. Mr. Maguire leaves, and Richard and Geoffrey are left alone with one another for the first time.   Things are awkward between father and son, and Richard begins hitting balls to avoid conversation.   Geoffrey finally makes small talk. 
GEOFFREY Maguire's stepping down in January.   He's, uh, handing things over to Matty. Richard gives his dad a look.   He knows where this is going. 
RICHARD That's great for them. 
GEOFFREY So.   How's work with you? 
RICHARD Good.   Busy.   You know. 
GEOFFREY I do.   I do.   Hey, did I tell you that we're opening a little office in Japan? 
RICHARD Congratulations. 
GEOFFREY We're not just a mom and pop operation anymore.   We're going global. 
RICHARD Uh-huh. Geoffrey stops hitting golf balls for a second.   He's been thinking about this moment for a long time. 
GEOFFREY I could really use your help. 
RICHARD Dad.   Please.   I'm in New York.   Margaret's in New York.   We have jobs. 
GEOFFREY I know.   I know.   It's just... 
RICHARD 
(CHALLENGING) It's just what? 
GEOFFREY You're only a secretary. This pisses Richard off immediately. 
RICHARD Again with the secretary thing!   I've told you, I'm an assistant! 
GEOFFREY Just because you call yourself an "assistant" doesn't mean you're not really just a secretary. 
RICHARD Well if I'm "just a secretary", why would you want me up here anyway?   Sounds like you're doing great without me. 
GEOFFREY It's not like that and you know it. 
RICHARD Then how is it?   Explain it to me. Geoffrey looks around to see if anyone is listening. 
GERTRUDE What do you mean? 
MARGARET Well, Richard's such a player. Gertrude looks confused. MARGARET (cont'd) I mean he was a total player.   Before we started dating.   Six months ago. 
GERTRUDE 
MARGARET That surprises you? 
GERTRUDE Did he ever tell you why we broke up? 
MARGARET We don't really talk much about stuff like that. 
GERTRUDE Oh.   Well I should shut up... 
MARGARET No, no.   Please.   I mean, we are getting married.   I want to know these things. Gertrude looks down a little embarrassed. 
GERTRUDE He proposed to me.   When we were seniors. Margaret laughs. 
MARGARET I'm sorry.   I didn't mean to...   He proposed to you in high school? 
GERTRUDE He bought this sweet little ring, and got down on his knee.   It was so cute. 
MARGARET You must have... 
GERTRUDE ... freaked out?   Oh you bet.   I broke up with him on the spot. 
MARGARET I would hope so. 
GERTRUDE After getting rejected the first time, I can't imagine how hard it was for him to get up the courage to ask you. Margaret just smiles, feeling guilty about lying when Gertrude is being so honest with her. GERTRUDE (cont'd) Anyway.   The idea that my little old man could be a player...   It's just not the Richard I knew.   Good thing you're making an honest man of him again. 
Gertrude toasts Margaret and knocks back the rest of her beer in one swig.   She has a hard time finishing it off. GERTRUDE (cont'd) Well I'm empty.   I'm going to go get another.   I think I hear Ramone wrapping up, let's get back to the girls. 
MARGARET I'll be right in. Margaret smiles and turns to the ocean.   Gertrude goes inside. Then, to herself, Margaret silently whispers. MARGARET (cont'd) We are awful people. 
EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY 
THWACK!   An axe slams down and splits a log in two.   Hands quickly place another log down and THWACK!   We pull back to find Richard playing the role of executioner.   He's still mad after talking to his dad, and is taking it out on the firewood.   Rage Against the Machine plays on his iPod and he's in his own world. Behind him, the girls return to the island on the family yacht. Their mood is light, and they chat amongst themselves.   Debbie's mood deflates when she sees Richard. 
DEBBIE 
(SHOUTING) Richard!   Honey!   Is everything OK? With his back to the girls and the iPod on, Richard doesn't hear or see the girls. Annie shakes her head.   Something is up. 
INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY 
Geoffrey pets Balzac as he watches SportsCenter on a sixty inch plasma television.   The ladies arrive and Annie and Debbie step in front of the TV, blocking his view.   Margaret watches from the door, not sure what is going on. 
GEOFFREY Excuse me?   I'm watching that. 
ANNIE Why is Richard chopping wood? 
DEBBIE And don't play dumb.   What did you do? Geoffrey is uncomfortable answering in front of Margaret. 
GEOFFREY Nothing.   I didn't do anything... will you please move. The showdown intensifies.   Margaret excuses herself. 
MARGARET I am so tired. Balzac GROWLS when he hears Margaret's voice.   He's still mad. Margaret just smiles. MARGARET (cont'd) Think I'm going to take a shower and clean off Ramone's bubble gum body oil. Thanks for a great night. Annie and Debbie smile graciously and wish her good night.   Once she's gone, they turn their death stare back to Geoffrey.   He looks genuinely unnerved. 
GEOFFREY Stop looking at me like that! 
EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY 
Richard continues to listen to his iPod, and has worked up quite a sweat.     He's stacks the last log, takes off his soaked through shirt, and gets a whiff of himself.   Ew.   He stinks. 
INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY 
Margaret walks into the private bathroom attached to her room and shuts the door.   We hear her turn on the shower. 
INT. PAXTON ESTATE FAMILY ROOM - DAY 
(EMBARRASSED) Hey. They walk a few steps, and before Margaret can say a word. MARGARET (cont'd) You know him? 
RICHARD He was my shop teacher. 
MARGARET Of course he was.   How many people are on this island? They start to fill their cart with cases of champagne. 
RICHARD Like eight thousand?   Depends on the time of the year. 
MARGARET Feels smaller. With the cart full they head to the checkout. 
RICHARD (to Ramone) You got the phone I called about? 
RAMONE Charged up, ready to go, number changed. Ramone throws Richard a phone. 
RICHARD Thanks, Ramone. 
RAMONE No problem. Ramone gives Margaret a flirty wave.   She awkwardly waves back. Richard pushes the cart out the front door and does not pay. Margaret is confused. 
EXT. SITKA GENERAL STORE - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Richard keeps pushing the cart, Margaret catches up. 
MARGARET Why's Ramone letting you steal his stuff? 
RICHARD It's our stuff. 
Richard points to the "Paxton General Store" sign. 
MARGARET That must have been handy in High School. 
RICHARD You have no idea. 
MARGARET Should you leave the cart? 
RICHARD It's our cart.   I didn't know you were such a prude. 
MARGARET I've come to realize that being my assistant gave you more access to my life than I ever imagined, but there are a few things you don't know about me. 
RICHARD I doubt it.   When I started, you were still wearing those Ugg boot things. 
MARGARET (deadly serious) I told you never to talk about that. 
RICHARD I'm just saying it's been a long time.   I know it all. Margaret turns on her new phone.   It searches for a signal. 
MARGARET (up to the challenge) Did you know I took disco lessons in the sixth grade? 
RICHARD Where? 
MARGARET The Y. 
RICHARD Margaret 1, Richard 0. 
MARGARET Uh, my first concert was Kool and the Gang. 
RICHARD At Woodstock? 
MARGARET I won tickets on the radio and saw them at the fair. 
RICHARD What'd they sing again? 
MARGARET You know. 
(SINGING) Cherish the love we have, we should cherish the life we live... Richard shakes his head. MARGARET (cont'd) Well they were good. 
RICHARD You had a lot of soul there, Canada. 
MARGARET I really like "The O.C.".   Not fake, ha, ha isn't it funny I like this trash.   I really like it. 
INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALL - DAY 
Richard and Mrs. Whiting walk around the elementary school. 
MRS. WHITING Do you think she'll be long?   I've got work to do. 
RICHARD She'll be out of there in two shakes. Out of the corner of his eye, Richard catches Gertrude teaching a class of second graders.   He stops transfixed. 
MRS. WHITING (re: Gertrude) We are so lucky to have her.   Mr. Megher really left us shorthanded when he ran off in the middle of the school year.   He's living out in the forest now with his wolves.   Full time. Richard hasn't heard anything that Mrs. Whiting has said.   He's hypnotized by Gertrude.   She looks happy teaching these kids, and they hang on her every word. MRS. WHITING (cont'd) Will you excuse me?   The bell is about to ring, I need to get ready for recess. 
RICHARD (not paying attention) Uh, sure. Mrs. Whiting leaves.   Richard goes to the door and Gertrude sees him.   Good lord can that woman smile.   She waves him in. 
INSIDE THE CLASSROOM The kids all turn to see Richard when he opens the door. 
GERTRUDE Class, this is my old friend Richard. 
CLASS (all together) Hi Richard! 
GERTRUDE Richard and I used to be in this very same classroom together.   We even had your old teacher, Mr. Megher. 
CHILD #1 Mr. Megher smelled like farty eggs! The class giggles. 
GERTRUDE That's not a nice thing to say, Patrick. The BELL RINGS.   One girl gets up.   Gertrude eyeballs her. GERTRUDE (cont'd) Marcia? 
CHILD #2 Sorry. The child sits back down.   Gertrude waits a beat. 
GERTRUDE OK, everyone is excused for recess. All the kids pop up and head to the door.   Mrs. Whiting directs traffic outside.   Richard makes his way to Gertrude. 
RICHARD Patrick's right.   He did smell like eggs. 
GERTRUDE It's still not a nice thing to say.   And actually, Mr. Megher smelled like wet dog and... (makes smoking pot motion) ...Matanuska Thunderfuck.   But let's keep that between us. 
INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - OFFICE - DAY 
Margaret reads over her e-mail to Frank. 
MARGARET 
(READING) I give you my word as an editor and a friend... The door opens suddenly, and Margaret SHOUTS. MARGARET (cont'd) 
(STERN) Five more minutes!   Please! 
Margaret turns to find a PIG TAILED GIRL in the doorway. Terrified.   She SHRIEKS and runs off.   Margaret wants to apologize, but needs to keep working. MARGARET (cont'd) 
(WEAKLY) Sorry. 
INT. BARANOFF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY 
Gertrude and Richard wipe down the chalk boards together.   They are very comfortable together and have an easy rapport. 
RICHARD Remember when Mr. Megher made us do this after school for a week? 
GERTRUDE That was your fault. 
RICHARD Was not! 
GERTRUDE You tried to kiss me.   A girl has to defend herself. 
RICHARD C'mon! (Tom Cruise ala Top Gun) I had the shot.   I took it. Gertrude rolls her eyes.   She's heard this a hundred times. 
GERTRUDE No Top Gun.   Please. 
RICHARD What?   You loved my Top Gun. 
GERTRUDE No.   You loved your Top Gun.   I just smiled and laughed like a good girlfriend. 
RICHARD That's right.   Ice... man.   I am dangerous. Richard clicks his teeth together, trying to mimic Tom Cruise. Gertrude is not impressed. 
Richard and Margaret unload champagne.   Richard is still thinking about Gertrude and wanting to be alone. 
MARGARET So, what did you and Gertrude talk about? Richard lies. 
RICHARD Nothing.   About her school.   The kids and stuff.   Apparently my second grade teacher was a pot head. 
MARGARET That was it?   I was gone for awhile... 
RICHARD (cuts her off) Yeah.   That was it.   You know, I can do this.   You should really go try on the dress for my mom. 
MARGARET I was going to go for a run first, it's been three days since I got out, I'm feeling crazy. 
RICHARD (could care less) Whatever. Margaret isn't accustomed to Richard talking to her this way, but doesn't push it. 
EXT. PAXTON TRAIL - DAY 
Margaret runs at a fast pace deep in the woods.   She's running hard, muttering to herself, and working out the aggression she's accumulated over the last thirty six hours.   She's lost in her own world, until she sees smoke, and slows to a stop. 
MARGARET What now? Margaret follows the smoke, and hears a mysterious DRUMBEAT.   She soon discovers a tremendous bonfire by the water, and a SHAMAN dancing around it.   He is dressed in a loin cloth, and wears a carved bear's head mask and tribal make up.   His belly shakes as he spastically moves around the fire. The Shaman sings a song that sounds centuries old. 
SHAMAN Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm. Margaret hides behind a tree and stares at this man in a trance. He begins to yell at the fire and scream at the top of his lungs. Exhausted, he stops and catches his breath.   He yells out again. SHAMAN (cont'd) Margaret, welcome! She looks around.   Maybe another Margaret is in the vicinity. SHAMAN (cont'd) Come to me, Margaret of New York. Nope, that's her.   She carefully steps out into the clearing. SHAMAN (cont'd) It is I, father Paxton. Sure enough, Geoffrey is beneath all the make-up. 
MARGARET What, ah, are you doing? 
GEOFFREY My shaman Kevin told me to get out here and clear my head.   As you know, things have been a little crazy around here.   You should join me. 
MARGARET Ya know, I've got to get back. 
GEOFFREY You closed minded southerners amuse me. Never willing to leave the nest and try 
MARGARET I'm a big fan of the nest. Geoffrey throws sand into the fire and it blazes higher. 
GEOFFREY Dance with me!   You besmirch my ways if you deny my circle. Worried she's going to really piss him off, Margaret relents. 
MARGARET OK, OK.   I "accept your circle." Geoffrey smiles and throws more sand into the fire. 
GEOFFREY Clear your mind and follow me. Geoffrey begins dancing slowly, contorting his body.   Margaret follows, always a half step behind, and can't get into it.   After a few moments, Margaret stops. 
MARGARET I'm gonna head back. 
GEOFFREY We're not done. 
MARGARET I think I am. Margaret begins to leave.   Geoffrey calls after her. 
GEOFFREY Margaret? Margaret stops and turns around. GEOFFREY (cont'd) I'm sorry we got off on the wrong foot.   But I'm making an effort here.   Don't leave now. Much to her chagrin, Margaret stays.   Geoffrey is pleased. GEOFFREY (cont'd) Thank you. (switching gears) Yai...takuju magaluam Ut uksu lingm ik pifiksailiriju m 1k... Geoffrey throws more sand on the fire to make it go higher and speeds up the dance.   Margaret is getting better, but it is still painfully awkward. 
GEOFFREY (cont'd) ...tuakjuk qangani takujumagaluam Ut qangalan uarm. Geoffrey speeds up the dance. GEOFFREY (cont'd) Now you. 
MARGARET Me what? 
GEOFFREY Chant. 
MARGARET Chant what? 
GEOFFREY Whatever comes out, just chant.   It is the way.   You'll feel better. 
MARGARET I can't... 
GEOFFREY Close your eyes.   Chant. Margaret and Geoffrey keep dancing.   Margaret closes her eyes, but can't figure out what to say. GEOFFREY (cont'd) Chant! 
MARGARET I don't know any chants! 
GEOFFREY Chant! 
MARGARET 
(GUTTERAL) Toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... Looking at Margaret, it's surprising she can make such a low noise. MARGARET (cont'd) ...ooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... 
GRANDMA ANNIE Oh, don't worry about that.   We've got these seams by the arm, this'll be easy. Annie marks up the dress with tailor's chalk. GRANDMA ANNIE (cont'd) We can fix this no problem. Margaret smiles, but knows that Annie couldn't be more wrong. 
EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY 
Richard helps WORKERS build a stage for the band.   He's still in a foul mood when Margaret interrupts in a panic. 
MARGARET We need to talk. 
RICHARD I'm a little busy. 
MARGARET Well I'm freaking out.   I need to get away from here.   From everyone.   Now. 
RICHARD Go for another run. 
MARGARET No!   I did that.   It did not help. 
RICHARD I'm a little tired of you making demands and me just jumping... 
MARGARET (re: wedding stuff) We're not going to need any of this if I don't get out of here. 
RICHARD OK, high maintenance.   Let's go. 
EXT. PAXTON SPEED BOAT - DAY 
Unlike the bulky yacht, this boat is built for speed and maneuverability. Richard starts her up. 
MARGARET Move over, I'm driving. Margaret cuts in front of Richard and grabs the wheel. 
RICHARD You don't know where we're going. Margaret opens up the throttle and they are off. 
MARGARET It doesn't matter. 
ON THE OPEN OCEAN Margaret and Richard leave everyone behind and take off for the horizon. 
As they jet up the coast away from civilization, the green trees, blue water and wildlife (bears, puffins, moose) that inhabit the coastline have a calming effect on both of them.   In Alaska, it doesn't take long to leave humanity behind. Eventually, the boat travels through a channel with steep mountain walls on either side.   Although it is still warm out, an icy beach can be seen straight ahead. MARGARET (cont'd) Where are we? 
RICHARD The north pole.   Congratulations, we made it. (off Margaret's look) It's a glacier.   Tracy's Arm.   You better let me take it from here. 
MARGARET I'm fine. 
RICHARD Oh.   OK.   So like me, you've navigated a lot of glacier fields?   And not died? Margaret reluctantly moves aside and lets Richard steer. RICHARD (cont'd) Lady, you've got issues. 
MARGARET Yeah.   I'm a control freak.   Fine. 
RICHARD It doesn't stop there. 
MARGARET This coming from the sociopath. 
RICHARD Oh, please. 
MARGARET I'd never bring me here. 
RICHARD You drove! 
MARGARET I mean to Alaska. 
RICHARD Are you kidding me? Richard pulls next to the glacier and turns off the engine. 
MARGARET You're sick.   Doing this to them. 
RICHARD I explained to you... 
MARGARET They love you.   Do you get that? 
RICHARD Of course. 
MARGARET And you're still willing to lie to them? 
MARGARET Uh-huh. Richard is ten feet away from Margaret now.   He's checking the ice to see if it is stable.   He slowly walks her way. 
RICHARD So, I'm going to walk up to you and very slowly pull you out.   OK? 
MARGARET I'm really cold. 
RICHARD Yeah, that's normal when you're surrounded by ice. 
MARGARET (makes sense) 
OK. Richard stands over a stuck Margaret, whose head just comes up to his knee.   He calmly looks down on her. 
RICHARD So I'm going to pull you up by your armpits. I'm probably going to touch boob.   But don't freak out. Margaret shakes her head yes.   Richard reaches down and slowly lifts her out of the ice.   Margaret doesn't say a word. RICHARD (cont'd) When I get you all the way out, I need you to hold onto me.   I'm going to carry you over there. Margaret nods yes as she puts her arms around Richard.   He's strong, so it isn't difficult for him to slowly carry her "over the threshold" style, away from the hole in the ice.   He speaks once they're safe. 
RICHARD (cont'd) I've, uh, never done that before. 
MARGARET You said it was "no biggie". 
RICHARD Yeah.   Well.   You OK? 
MARGARET Yeah.   I'm fine. Richard smiles.   Margaret smiles back. Richard walks very comfortably with her in his arms.   She fits just right.   Margaret looks up to Richard gratefully. MARGARET (cont'd) 
(SMILING) You shouldn't of laughed at me. 
RICHARD You woulda laughed at me. 
MARGARET Yeah.   While I was getting my camera. The two stare at each other for a beat.   There's a real spark. They might kiss. 
RICHARD Gertrude wants me back. Whoah.   Not what she was expecting.   She looks down. 
MARGARET And? 
RICHARD Well.   It seemed like you were having... second thoughts. 
MARGARET Yeah.   I was. 
RICHARD Maybe we should do it.   Come clean. 
MARGARET Put me down. Richard puts Margaret down near the boat.   She tries to regain her composure. MARGARET (cont'd) You wanna call it off? 
RICHARD If you do. 
MARGARET Fine.   It's over.   We'll tell them when we get back. 
ON THE BOAT Margaret sits hunched over with a blanket wrapped around her. Richard drives the boat.   They don't talk. 
EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY 
Richard and Margaret walk towards the house, which looms above them as they prepare to deliver the news that they aren't getting married.   The front door opens, and Geoffrey comes outside in a hurry.   He's clearly been waiting. 
GEOFFREY Come with me. 
RICHARD Where's mom, dad?   We all need to talk. 
GEOFFREY Not now.   C'mon. Richard and Margaret look at each other, not sure what to do. Geoffrey storms off and they follow. 
EXT. PAXTON GUESTHOUSE - DAY 
Richard, Margaret and Geoffrey arrive at the door to the guesthouse.   Geoffrey stops before they go in. 
GEOFFREY (to Richard) I haven't told your mother about any of this, and I don't plan to. (to Margaret) I was really beginning to like you.   Sorry about this. Geoffrey opens the door and goes inside. 
INSIDE THE GUESTHOUSE The guesthouse has been converted into a squash court.   In the middle of the court, a man patiently sits on a metal folding chair.   It's Gilbertson.   He smiles. 
MR. GILBERTSON Hey there kids.   Good to see ya! 
RICHARD (to Dad) What did you do? Geoffrey doesn't answer.   He's not proud of himself. RICHARD (cont'd) (getting angry) What did you do, dad?! 
RICHARD You look gorgeous. 
MARGARET 
(SMILING) You look disgusting. 
RICHARD So, is this what you dreamed of when you were a little girl? 
MARGARET Oh, you bet. They make it to the Gazebo, where Ramone awaits. MARGARET (cont'd) Ramone. 
RAMONE 
(QUIETLY) Mi amo. (To the crowd) We are gathered here today to celebrate one of life's greatest moments.   To give recognition to the beauty, honesty, and unselfish ways... Margaret looks at Richard on the word "unselfish," but he's looking straight ahead, determined to get through this. RAMONE (cont'd) ...of Richard and Margaret's true love... "True Love" gets Margaret as well, although no one in the audience notices. RAMONE (cont'd) ...before their family and friends. "Family and Friends" gets a reaction out of Gertrude and Geoffrey.   She purses her lips.   He holds on to his chair in order to keep himself seated. RAMONE (cont'd) For it is family and friends who taught Richard and Margaret to love, so it is only right that family and friends all celebrate that love here today. 
RAMONE (cont'd) And if there is anyone who has cause why this couple should not be united in marriage and love, they must speak now or forever hold their peace. Gilbertson stays quiet.   Geoffrey takes a tug from a flask. Ramone is about to continue, but something gets his attention. He's not sure what to do. RAMONE (cont'd) Mi amo, do you have a question? We reveal that Margaret has her hand halfway up, eyes squinted shut like the new kid in class not sure of herself. 
MARGARET No. 
RAMONE Then why is your hand up? 
MARGARET I have something to say.   It's not a question though. 
RAMONE Can it wait âtil after? 
MARGARET Uh.   Um.   No. 
RICHARD What are you doing? Margaret gathers herself and turns around to the crowd.     They stare back, unsure what to make of this foreigner. 
MARGARET Hey there, folks.   Thanks for coming out. I've got a little announcement to make about the "wedding." 
RICHARD Don't do this. Margaret smiles and squeezes Richard's hand. 
MARGARET Not sure the best way to tell you all this. But, uh... I made Richard marry me.   This is all a sham. Gilbertson victoriously pumps his fist in the air. 
MARGARET (cont'd) I was going to get kicked out of the country -- so I told Richard that I would destroy his career if he didn't marry me. 
RICHARD Now wait... 
MARGARET Richard.   Please.   Let me finish. (to the Paxton family) Richard wanted to stop this when we got off the plane, but I wouldn't let him.   Don't blame him.   This is all my fault. (to Ramone) Could you get the band started?   And give these people something to drink. (to Gilbertson) And you.   Meet me at your dingy in ten, you're taking me to the airport. 
MR. GILBERTSON You got it! Margaret nods, hands Richard the bouquet, and confidently walks back up the aisle with all eyes on her.   She stops when she gets to Gertrude and leans down. 
MARGARET Take care of him. 
GERTRUDE Promise. Margaret walks back into the house.   Alone. 
INT. MARGARET'S ROOM - DAY 
Margaret's wedding dress is laid out on the bed.   Her bag is packed.   Richard knocks and comes in.   Margaret is on the phone. 
MARGARET (unenthusiastically to phone) Uh-huh.   Yeah.   That's great Frank.   Good news.   Talk to you on Monday. Margaret hangs up. 
RICHARD So Frank's back in? Margaret nods distractedly.   Getting Frank to do the publicity tour doesn't mean much right now. 
MARGARET Yup.   He's in.   For now. 
RICHARD Maybe this'll be your Mockingbird? 
MARGARET Yeah.   Right. Margaret starts collecting her bags. 
RICHARD Great exit back there. 
MARGARET Thanks.   Fun weekend. 
RICHARD Same old, same old, around here. 
MARGARET Wasn't sure if your mom would want me to strip the sheets, so I just left them. 
GERTRUDE Find out what? 
RICHARD If she feels the same way. Gertrude begins to tear up, but won't let herself cry. 
GERTRUDE Well.   OK then.   What's a girl gonna do? (voice cracking) I guess you want who you want. Gertrude gives a melancholy smile. 
RICHARD I'm so sorry. 
(BEAT) But, I gotta go. 
GERTRUDE Uh-huh. Richard gets up. 
RICHARD Are you OK? 
GERTRUDE I'm fine.   Really.   Go. Gertrude nods her approval and Richard runs off to the party. 
EXT. PAXTON ESTATE - PARTY - DAY 
Debbie, Geoffrey and Annie sit at a table next to the bar, dumbstruck looks on their faces.   Ramone mixes drinks and flips bottles.   Richard runs up to them all, looking excited. 
GEOFFREY What are you so God damn happy about? 
RICHARD What?   Oh.   Well, I'm, uh, going to see Margaret. 
GEOFFREY What?! 
DEBBIE She violated you.   We should report her. 
RICHARD Who you gonna report her to, mom? 
DEBBIE Oh my God.   He's got the Stockholm syndrome. 
RICHARD I don't have the Stockholm syndrome.   And she didn't violate me. 
DEBBIE What is going on, Richard? Richard slows down and explains to his mom. 
RICHARD I'm sorry I lied to you.   That was an awful thing to do.   But it took this weekend for me to see how funny, and screwed up and perfect Margaret is for me.   I think she's... the one. 
DEBBIE But you already thought she was the one. 
RICHARD No, I didn't.   Not until she left. 
DEBBIE Really?   Does she think that too? 
RICHARD I don't know.   I've got to get to the airport to find out. Debbie doesn't say anything, then breaks into a smile. 
DEBBIE (so romantic) He's going to stop her from leaving!   At the airport! 
RICHARD But I gotta hurry.   Her plane leaves any second.   I might not make it. 
DEBBIE (so romantic) He's not sure he's going to make it! 
GEOFFREY Are you buying this horse shit? 
DEBBIE Oh, Geoffrey! 
RICHARD I don't have time to explain this to you. 
GEOFFREY Well then make some god-damn time.   Cause I won't let you throw your life away for some woman. 
RICHARD I don't care. 
GEOFFREY Excuse me? 
RICHARD I don't care.   I love you and want you to understand.   But I'm not asking your permission here.   I'm doing this. 
GEOFFREY Oh, really? From behind them, Annie stands up and shouts. 
RICHARD Need you to do me a solid, brother.   I gotta see my girl and she's on that flight.   Could you stop it for me? 
CHUCK No can do brohan.   Need a good reason for the FAA holes.   Lose my jobby job if I delivered that favor. 
RICHARD Oh, c'mon Chuck! 
INT. PLANE - DAY 
The plane rattles as it gains speed for takeoff.   Margaret studies the safety pamphlet, trying to ignore Gilbertson. 
MR. GILBERTSON ...so next topic.   Celebrities.   Let's invite the Bill Clinton's and leave out the Paris Hilton's, OK? Gilbertson smiles as he looks out the window and sees the plane leave Sitka. 
EXT. TOWER - DAY 
Richard and his family stand outside the tower and watch Margaret's plane take off. 
RICHARD Well.   That's it.   Once she gets back to New York, it'll be like this never happened. Richard looks defeated.   Geoffrey sees how sad his son is, and takes a deep breath. 
GEOFFREY So, you know I think you shouldn't be with Margaret, right? 
RICHARD You've made that crystal clear. 
GEOFFREY Good. (looks at Annie) Well, consider this me keeping my promise. Geoffrey pulls out his cell phone and hits a button.   He waits for an answer. GEOFFREY (cont'd) (to phone) Hey!   Maguire!   Yeah, yeah, yeah, her running out was something.   But that's what I'm calling about.   I've got a favor to ask you, âbout one of your planes... 
INT. PLANE - DAY 
Gilbertson continues to talk.   Margaret is in a stupor. 
MR. GILBERTSON ...you know those two hundred pages I took out?   I'm going to put them back... A flight attendant comes to Margaret and interrupts. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Ms. Mills?   Would you come with me? Margaret is excited to get away from Gilbertson. 
MARGARET Yes, of course. She unbuckles her seat belt, about to get out of her seat. 
MR. GILBERTSON What's this about? 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (never done this before) There's someone on the radio for you. The flight attendant points to the Flight Attendant CB located at the front of the plane, outside the cockpit. FLIGHT ATTENDANT (cont'd) Uh, a Richard Paxton? Margaret shakes her head and re-buckles her seat belt. 
MARGARET Tell him I'm not here. 
CUT TO: 
INT. TOWER - DAY 
Richard and his family are huddled around the radio in the tower. Chuck sits nearby. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT (O.S.) (from radio) I'm sorry.   She won't come talk to you. 
RICHARD Shit!   She's never going to pick up... 
CHUCK (to Richard) Know what, home slice?   Cut this chica loose.   You remember Beth Cable?   She'd totally be into you... Suddenly, Richard has an idea.   He picks up the hand mic. 
RICHARD Excuse me Miss Flight Attendant, could you ask the captain to do me one more favor... 
CUT TO: 
INT. PLANE - DAY 
DING!   The captain comes on over the loudspeaker. 
CAPTAIN (over plane loudspeaker) Welcome to flight 1601 to Seattle, this is your captain.   We've reached our cruising altitude of 30,000 feet.   Flight time'll   be three hours and thirty minutes.   And Margaret?   Richard has something he'd like to say to you.

FADE IN 
INT. BARGE - DAY 
Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side. 
INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY 
Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull. 
EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY 
Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north- west.  She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way forward. 
EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel smoke rising from its massive turbine vents. 
Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be considered pretty. 
She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward the tug at the other end. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY 
DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge (37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the north. 
They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern where the cable winds into a tow anchor. 
EPPS It's a slow leak. 
She unclips and drops to the deck. 
GREER What's slow? 
EPPS Maybe twenty gallons an hour. 
DODGE Where from? 
EPPS Amidships starboard at the beam. Just under the waterline. I don't think it's a problem. 
GREER Hear that, Dodge? Epps don't think it's a problem. 
DODGE I'll sleep good tonight knowing that. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The view from the pilothouse commands 360 degrees as radar and GPS navigation displays glow. MURPHY, the ship's master, pilots the boat. He is 48, at sea all his adult life, and most of the rest, a fact written on his face and one that every crewman who's ever worked for him has been willing to bet his life on. A walkie-talkie CRACKLES AWAKE. 
GREER (V.O. RADIO) Greer to Murphy. 
MURPHY (lifting the radio) Go. 
Murphy turns back to see Greer, Epps, and Dodge looking up at him from the stern. 
GREER The number nine on the starboard side's half flooded. Epps says it's a slow leak just under the waterline, about twenty gallons an hour. They must've pumped it before we left Sitka. 
MURPHY Of course they did. 
GREER Let the buyer beware. 
MURPHY What do you say, Dodge? 
DODGE (V.O. RADIO) (taking the radio) If it started out at twenty an hour the piece of shit'd be at the bottom of the Gulf by now. Whether it'll make St. Lawrence is anybody's guess. 
EXT. OPEN OCEAN - DAY 
HIGH AND WIDE as the Arctic Warrior pulls the barge against the swell of a grey ocean and a darkening sky. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. PORT GERMAINE - ST. LAWRENCE ISLAND - DAY 
The shores of St. Lawrence Island open into a small port town of mainly pre-fab buildings as the Arctic Warrior approaches with the barge, now pathetically listing to one side as it moves into the harbor. 
EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - LATER - DAY 
A smaller harbor tug helps the Arctic Warrior jockey the listing barge to the dock as Epps and Dodge jump off to tie her up. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
COASTGUARDSMAN Darlene -- 
GIRLFRIEND You, shut up. 
EPPS (starting off) Listen, I don't want any trouble, okay -- ? 
GIRLFRIEND (stopping Epps) Uh-uh. No. We're gonna fix this right now. 
MURPHY (stepping up) What seems to be the trouble, ladies? 
RIVETER Whyn't you mind your own business, chief. 
Murphy turns to see a shipyard RIVETER, a big man holding a beer, still wearing his welding leathers. Murphy turns back to Epps and the Girlfriend. 
MURPHY As I said, what seems to be the trouble? 
RIVETER Didn't you hear me, grandpa? Or you got your hearing aid turned down? 
MURPHY I heard you. But I'm choosing to ignore you. Epps, let's go. 
Epps starts forward but the Riveter stands in her way, taking Murphy by the collar. 
RIVETER These ladies was having themselves a discussion and you're interrupting it. 
MURPHY You got about two seconds to get your paws off me, Tarzan. 
RIVETER Or what? 
Or WHACK! Murphy can't help but wince as a pool cue breaks in two over the Riveter's head. 
Dodge, cigarette in his mouth, takes a look at the cue half he still holds, shaking his head. 
The Riveter's hands fall from Murphy's collar and his legs buckle. Some of his BUDDIES hold him up as Greer reminds some of the others he's holding a pool cue of his own. 
MURPHY Epps? 
He looks to Epps like let's get the hell out of here. She grabs her coat. 
COASTGUARDSMAN Wait. 
Epps holds there as the Coastguardsman steps up to his girlfriend. 
COASTGUARDSMAN Darlene. It's over. 
He gives her the ring from his finger. Murphy rolls his eyes as the others look on. 
COASTGUARDSMAN I don't love you anymore. 
Darlene breaks into tears as they all look on, some pat her on the back. 
COASTGUARDSMAN (to Epps) Come on, Candy. Let's get out of here. 
The Coastguardsman takes her by the hand. Epps looks to Murphy and the others as he leads her out. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY 
Murphy, Greer, and Dodge ready the tug to leave as Epps approaches on the dock. She jumps down onto the deck, a spring in her step and a song in her heart. 
EPPS Morning everybody. 
GREER Show your tatoos to that coxswain last night, did you Epps? 
EPPS Showed him a hell of a lot more than that. 
GREER I bet you did. 
MURPHY Candy? 
EPPS It's my pen name. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY 
Murphy throttles up the turbines and backs the tug away from the dock as Greer studies the dawn sky. 
GREER Red sky at night, sailor's delight. 
MURPHY Red sky in morning, sailor take warning. 
EXT. PORT GERMAINE - DOCKS - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
As the tug turns into the harbor channel, the sun rising under a cloud bank of brilliant red and orange. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - NIGHT 
Dodge and Epps play cards at the galley table. 
DODGE Fuck it. 
He puts down his hand. Epps takes another drag from her cigarette, collecting her winnings. 
DODGE Smugglers maybe. 
GREER Smuggling what? Tundra grass? 
A beat as Murphy holds there. He raises the radio mic. 
MURPHY Merchant vessel at position one seven four one five west, five seven seven five north, this is tugboat Arctic Warrior. Do you copy? Over. 
Again, only the quiet hiss of static comes back. 
GREER Call the Coastguard? 
MURPHY Steer to one eight five. Let's check her out. 
EXT. OPEN OCEAN - NIGHT 
The Arctic Warrior cuts a foamy break in the ink black water. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON RADAR DISPLAY as the phantom point flashes closer. 
Murphy looks on as Greer pilots, Dodge and Epps watching. 
MURPHY Alright. Back it off. 
Greer throttles back and the boat slows. 
MURPHY Hit the lights. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
The halogen flood lights flare to life, brilliantly illuminating the water in front of the boat. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
The four of them look intently into the darkness beyond the light. Murphy reaches for the spot control, sweeping a broad beam of light with a joy stick. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
As the tug moves along, servo motors sweep the searchlight over the bow of the boat and into the darkness. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
They peer into the night beyond the boat as it slowly moves, when a shadow looms into view. 
MURPHY Whoa, whoa. 
Greer throttles down all the way and they drift, as the shadow looms bigger before them in the light from the boat. 
As they approach, the shadow appears to be a giant rusting bow, rising up from the water, disappearing in the darkness above them. Murphy sweeps the searchlight to reveal more of what appears to be a large, darkened ship. As they come around, the name "CHIMERA" can be seen above the anchor alleys. 
MURPHY "Chimera." 
Murphy reaches for the mic, hits the LOUD HAILER. 
MURPHY Chimera. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
The tug is dwarfed by the massive rusting hulk of the Chimera rising above it. 
MURPHY (O.S. LOUD HAILER) This is civilian tugboat Arctic Warrior. Is there anyone aboard? 
The quiet rumble of the tug's turbines is the only sound. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
Murphy raises the mic again. 
MURPHY Chimera, I am hove to at your port bow. Is there anyone aboard? 
They wait, looking on at the silent, darkened ship under the glare of their lights. 
MURPHY Epps, come with me. You guys sit tight. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - NIGHT 
Epps and Murphy, in heavy parkas, climb a hydraulic deck crane up to the Chimera as Dodge man's the controls against the movement of the water. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT 
Greer holds the tug steady as Epps and Murphy can be seen making their way up under the floodlights. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 
Murphy pulls himself up and jumps down onto the deck. Epps jumps down behind him. Murphy throws his light up on the superstructure. All remnants of paint have been rusted over, lending a still darker ominousness to it. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 
Murphy and Epps move cautiously along, shining their lights as they go. Despite the omnipresent corrosion, everything seems to be in order. The decks are clear and there is no apparent damage. They come to a hatchway. Epps shines her light down the darkened passage. Murphy moves in. 
MURPHY It's a risk I'm willing to take. 
GREER All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it. 
MURPHY So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before. 
DODGE It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size. 
MURPHY The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull. 
A long beat as they hold there. 
MURPHY Listen. Forget this job's just a pay check for a minute. You know I've been good to you. But I'm prepared to offer you something better now. (a beat) If we do this right, it's worth a lot of money. A lot of money. 
They hold there looking on at him, waiting. 
EPPS Go on. 
MURPHY Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more. (a beat) What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways. 
A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer. 
MURPHY Think about it. A million bucks a piece. (a beat) You want to spend the rest of your days drag-assing tank barges on the gulf coast, fine. Otherwise, let's get to work. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY 
The tug is tied up alongside the Chimera, whose dark hull stretches off for seven hundred more feet in the light of day. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY 
Murphy brings up the radio mic as Greer and the others look on. 
MURPHY (to radio) United States Coastguard, United States Coastguard, United States Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over. 
After a moment, a distance-warped, coolly professional, female voice comes back. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over. 
MURPHY North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel? 
MURPHY A passenger liner. Over. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Say again. Over. 
Murphy looks to the others, almost smiling. 
MURPHY A passenger liner, north island. Over. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over. 
MURPHY Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at... (checking his watch) Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over. 
MURPHY Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - STERN WINCH - DAY 
Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer are standing on the stern of the boat under the power winch. 
DODGE Okay. We're gonna use a heavier than usual twin cable rig this time, consisting of a pair of number three gauge braided wire tows. (a beat) We'll tie off through the anchor alleys. And come down to the aft port and starboard pins. Here.  Thus, we need to get two of these... (indicating the cable) Up there. 
He indicates the bow of the Chimera. 
DODGE Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy. (a beat) Any questions? 
EPPS Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow. 
DODGE Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions? 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY 
Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables dangling from it down to the winch on the stern. 
WITH EPPS 
Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes his face out from the other side. 
DODGE Ready? 
EPPS Bring it on, dude. 
Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten it down, with the effect of joining the two cables. 
EPPS OK. 
Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable through the anchor alleys. 
DODGE (O.S.) (finally) Hit it! 
Murphy eases forward on the throttle, picking up speed. 
EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The giant ship CREAKS AND MOANS as it starts forward, a small bow break forming on its hull. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The tug is kicking up a foaming wake as it pulls the Chimera along behind it. Dodge lets out a hoot, exchanging high fives with Epps and Greer. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy smiles as he looks back at the Chimera following behind. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY 
CLOSE ON A CHART. The south Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. A pencil traces a route. 
MURPHY (O.S.) I figure we go through at the Unimak Pass here. Refuel at Sanak Island. 
Greer looks on from the helm as Murphy, Dodge and Epps stand over the map table. 
MURPHY With a little extra fuel, weather permitting, we should make Sitka in five days without another stop. 
DODGE Sounds reasonable. 
GREER Hypothetically speaking, what if we get this boat to Sitka and find out somebody wants it back? 
DODGE They shoulda thought of that when they let her float away. 
GREER I don't care what, ain't nobody just gonna let us walk away with a ship that size. 
MURPHY The law's on our side. If they want to challenge it, let them try. 
EPPS They must've scuttled it. Nobody just lets a ship float away. 
DODGE Nobody just scuttles a passenger liner either. 
EPPS Ever heard of insurance, big boy? 
MURPHY Either way, we found it. It's ours now -- . 
An EXPLOSIVE THUD shudders the boat. They look to each other. 
DODGE (moving for the door) What the... 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Dodge jumps down from the pilothouse as another LOUD THUMP BLOWS OUT OF THE TURBINE VENTS, SHOWERING OIL OVER THE DECK. 
DODGE (shouting up to the pilothouse) ALL STOP! ALL STOP! 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Greer shoves the throttle back. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The boat goes dead in the water, thick black smoke billowing from the turbine vents. 
EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
as the bow slows in the water, the tow cables coming slack. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Dodge pulls open the door. The place is thick with smoke as he makes his way to the turbine gauges, Epps and Murphy behind. Dodge opens the number one turbine cover, looks inside. 
DODGE Mother fucker! 
MURPHY What is it? 
DODGE Threw a turbine blade. 
Dodge looks over the smoking turbine, pulls back an aluminum intake blade, hot to the touch. 
DODGE Son of a bitch! 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY 
Greer, Dodge, Epps, and Murphy confer on the deck. 
DODGE The number one turbine's pretty well trashed. Number two runs, but it's way underpowered. 
MURPHY How long to fix? 
DODGE Hard to say. I gotta get in there and have a look. At least a couple days. Depending. 
GREER You think the extra strain caused it? 
DODGE Nah. Everything was cool. It's just one of those things. 
EPPS Well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have.  Got stuck in the ice. The passengers and crew evacuated. She froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. They write it off. Fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. The ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her. 
Murphy nods, considering it. 
MURPHY As reasonable an explanation as any, I guess. 
Epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it. 
MURPHY Ever heard of the Mary Celeste? 
EPPS Nope. 
MURPHY She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872.  One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard. 
EPPS So what did happen? 
MURPHY Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure. 
EPPS You think she's sailing without a crew? 
Murphy looks out at the Chimera off the bow. 
MURPHY I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current. 
EPPS You're more practical than superstitious. 
MURPHY Only way to be. 
Epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the rusting hull of the Chimera stretching off in the light. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY 
Greer operates the crane arm as Dodge directs him. The crane hoists out one of the massive turbine fans onto the deck. Dodge gives him the thumbs up as it comes down easily. 
MURPHY What's this? 
DODGE Turbine rotor's shot. 
MURPHY I thought you said it was just a blade. 
DODGE Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal. 
MURPHY How much longer's that gonna take? 
DODGE Like I always say -- 
MURPHY I know I know, two ways to do anything -- 
DODGE The right way and the wrong way. 
MURPHY But how long? 
DODGE Hard to say. 
MURPHY We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history. 
DODGE I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is. 
MURPHY What about running number two by itself? 
DODGE It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it. 
MURPHY How long, then? 
DODGE I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- . 
MURPHY How long? 
DODGE Three, four days. 
MURPHY Goddamit, Dodge. 
DODGE What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper. 
A beat as Murphy stands there, knowing he's right. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (O.S RADIO) (from the pilothouse) Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard. Over. 
A beat. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Murphy enters the pilothouse as the distance-warped VOICE comes back on the radio. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over. 
Murphy raises the radio mic as Epps, Dodge, and Greer step in. 
MURPHY (to radio) North Island, North Island, North Island. This is tugboat Arctic Warrior. Over. 
After a moment, the same professional, distance-warped voice comes back. 
A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK CAN BE HEARD. 
A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see is an ancient grandfather clock. 
All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING. 
Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces her, now silent. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY 
Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through it. 
INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating bizarre patterns. 
INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie on the floor. 
INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY 
Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into 
INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine ball. 
She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm sea. 
INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY 
Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to the ceiling. 
INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into the depths of the ship. 
Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on loading palettes. 
In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly preserved. 
Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' eye. 
A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, as though blown back from some terrific explosive force. 
Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her light inside. 
A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object between broken wood slats. 
Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram ingot of gold. 
She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high and five feet across. 
A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in gold. 
INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY 
The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 4' stack of gold ingots. 
DODGE (O.S.) What the fuck we gonna do with it? 
Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on. 
GREER What the fuck you think we gonna do with it? It's ours, baby. It's all ours. 
Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it. 
GREER How much you figure that's worth, skipper? 
MURPHY (still looking it over) Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million. 
GREER Ho, baby! 
EPPS That's a lot of money for somebody to just let float away. 
Murphy looks up at her from the gold. 
MURPHY Yes, it is. 
A beat as they all hold there. 
MURPHY It's a hell of a lot of money. 
DODGE What, you think there's something funny about it? 
MURPHY A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it? 
GREER If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off. 
MURPHY Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for. 
EPPS That's what I call a payday. 
GREER Hell yeah. 
They slap hands. 
INT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
Murphy moves down the darkened passage, coming to a door marked "CAPTAIN." The door is ajar. He pushes it open. 
INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is ordered and in its place. 
Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and protractor amidst other sundry items. 
INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Murphy steps in. The room is undisturbed, light falling in on the taught green bedspread through dirty, tattered curtains.  A robe hangs on the back of a chair. A pair of slippers lie beneath it. 
INT. CHIMERA - CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Murphy stands in the bathroom. The tile has yellowed with time, but everything is exactly as it was left. Even the shaving kit is neatly arrayed on the sink as Murphy looks on at it. He looks up, seeing himself in the mirror, when an EXPLOSION SOUNDS. 
EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Murphy comes to the railing, looking out over the bow of the ship to see black smoke rising from where the Arctic Warrior is tied. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Greer and Epps run to the side to see billowing smoke rising from the Arctic Warrior as Murphy climbs down the crane to the deck. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy jumps down to the deck. Flames belch from an open hatch as Murphy grabs a fire extinguisher from a deck locker, coming to the engine room door. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an extinguisher of his own. 
The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment. 
Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and hands singed. 
An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire. 
DODGE (over the roar) Murphy! 
Murphy looks down to see his pant leg is on fire, as Dodge turns a cloud of halon on him, putting it out. 
DODGE Propane tanks're gonna go! 
Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher into them, holding it there. 
The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again as clouds of halon rise up. 
Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the wall again. 
Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the deck, and finally out. 
They stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with smoke. A fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, but the fire is out. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - DAY 
Dodge smokes a cigarette, now starting to feel his burned leg, which is oozing as Murphy and Greer look on. 
DODGE One minute I'm minding my own business, the next thing I know the whole place is burning up. (taking a drag) An oxygen tank must've blown on the welder. Started an oil fire. 
GREER Looks like it took out the backup genny too. 
MURPHY Terrific. 
Epps arrives with a first aid kit. 
MURPHY How's that leg? 
Epps cuts back the burned pant leg to see the burn. 
DODGE Seen better -- Ow! 
Epps cleans the burn with hydrogen peroxide. 
EPPS This's gonna hurt a little. 
DODGE Thanks for the warning -- Ow! Damn! 
Epps keeps cleaning as Dodge bears it. 
GREER What now? 
MURPHY We could call for help. 
In one corner is an armoire. Epps steps up to it, pulling back the door to reveal a rack of woman's clothing hanging there undisturbed. 
INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
A pair of slippers lie on the floor beside a chair, over which is draped a woman's robe. Epps lifts it, the material crumbling in her hands. 
INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
A drawer comes back to reveal a number of personal affects, a man's billfold, cuff links, tarnished silver cigarette holder and case, coins, black horn-rimmed glasses, pocket watch and fob, and a room key. 
Epps pulls back the billfold. She opens it. Inside she finds a Canadian passport a picture of a dark-haired man with a mustache and black horn-rimmed glasses, circa 1950. In the folds she finds three hundred Canadian dollars. An insert holds pictures, of a suburban home, children, and a woman, presumably his wife. 
INT. CHIMERA - "A" DECK PASSAGE - LATER - DAY 
Epps steps from the room. She turns to close the door, but stops, holding there, strongly sensing something. 
THE CAMERA SLOWLY COMES AROUND TO HER OTHER SIDE, revealing the long passageway behind her, each bulkhead hatchway creating the impression of a tunnel of mirrors that frame one another and, standing at the very end of this tunnel in the foggy light from a porthole, a MAN in dark clothing. 
Epps slowly turns her head to see what she already senses, the man standing at the end of the passageway facing her. A beat as they hold there. The man only stares back at her, then turns to walk away. 
EPPS Hey! 
Epps moves off as the man walks around the corner. 
EPPS Hey, wait a minute! Hey! 
MOVING WITH Epps as she breaks into a run, going down the passageway. She comes to the corner, rounding it out onto another passageway. The man is nowhere to be seen. 
Epps moves quickly down the passageway, coming to the next corner, rounding it out to see only another long passageway. She turns back, running right into Murphy. 
MURPHY Take it easy, you'll live longer. 
EPPS Did you see him? 
MURPHY Who? 
EPPS The guy. He just came this way. 
MURPHY What guy? 
EPPS There's somebody else on this boat. 
MURPHY What? What the hell're you talking about. 
EPPS I saw him. Just a minute ago. Some guy. 
MURPHY Are you sure? 
EPPS Of course I'm sure. I saw him. 
MURPHY You sure it wasn't me? 
EPPS It wasn't you. It was somebody else. There's somebody else aboard. 
A beat as Murphy looks back at her. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOT HOUSE - NIGHT 
Greer, Dodge, Murphy, and Epps stand around by lantern light. 
DODGE Light in those passages ain't so good. 
EPPS I'm telling you, I saw somebody. I don't know who it was. But I saw somebody. 
GREER What'd he look like? 
EPPS Maybe six feet. Lanky. I didn't get a good look. He was far away. But I saw him. I saw him as sure as you're standing there. 
DODGE Where's his boat, then? Where's his crew? He ain't gonna be out here by himself, that's for damn sure. 
GREER She's so big somebody could come alongside her on the other side and we'd never know it. 
EPPS Maybe that is his boat. 
DODGE Gimme a break. 
A beat as they sit in silence. 
MURPHY If somebody's aboard her already, she ain't ours. She's theirs. 
DODGE Bullshit. That boat hasn't made steam for fifty years. We found her. She's ours. 
MURPHY Not in the eyes of the law. 
EPPS So, we find this guy and make a deal with him. 
MURPHY We don't exactly have the best bargaining position. 
DODGE I say fuck the motherfucker. We're a professional salvage crew going about our business. What's some yahoo doing way out here by himself anyway? 
MURPHY And what do you propose? That we knock this guy off? 
A beat as Murphy looks on. 
MURPHY Tell you what, Dodge. Once we get back to shore, you can do whatever you want with your share. But until then, the gold stays right where it is. 
Dodge holds there. He looks to Epps a beat, takes a drink of coffee. 
EXT. CHIMERA - DAY 
The sun comes up over a spectacular cloud bank as the Arctic Warrior drifts alongside the Chimera. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY 
Murphy crosses to the deck house, climbs the stairs. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy opens the door, stopping dead in his tracks. A beat. He steps forward, crossing to the corner. 
The radio set lies before him, dented in and completely demolished, as if someone had taken a bat to it. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - ENGINE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Dodge works on one of the turbines when he is grabbed from behind and shoved into the wall. Murphy holds him fast. 
MURPHY Just what the hell do you think you're doing?! 
DODGE I don't know what you're talking about? 
MURPHY I think you know. 
DODGE Maybe you can tell me then. 
Murphy shoves him hard into the wall. 
MURPHY The radio! 
DODGE (not having a clue) The radio. Oh, yeah, the radio. 
Murphy tightens his grip. 
DODGE Take it easy, willya? What about the radio?! 
MURPHY You smashed it! 
DODGE What?! 
MURPHY Don't lie to me! 
DODGE What the fuck -- ? 
MURPHY You didn't want us calling anybody. Too liable to ruin your big payday. 
DODGE I didn't touch the fucking radio. 
Murphy tightens his grip still more. 
DODGE I didn't touch the fucking radio! (a beat) Ever occur to you there's somebody else on that boat, skipper? 
MURPHY Conveniently enough for you. 
DODGE Look, I didn't touch it. Alright? 
Murphy holds there a beat longer. He shoves Dodge back letting him go. 
DODGE Jesus. 
Dodge checks his throat as Murphy looks on. 
EPPS (O.S.) Murphy. 
They turn to see Epps in the hatchway. 
EPPS It's Greer. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Greer stands at the galley sink finishing off the last of a jug of water as Murphy and the others step in. He turns to see them. 
GREER Never been more thirsty in my life. 
MURPHY Drink up then. 
Greer smiles, raising the jug to drink as the others take a seat, looking on at him. 
MURPHY How're you feeling? 
GREER Lost my sea legs. 
EPPS Any dizziness? 
GREER No. 
EPPS Looks like part of the general log. 
Epps points to a page that has been incompletely ripped out. 
EPPS "The crew have gone mad with greed and fight among themselves like wild dogs over fresh kill." 
MURPHY February first. 
EPPS The same day she supposedly went down. 
MURPHY Must not've been the captain's entry. He was probably out of the picture by then. 
Epps continues to read. 
EPPS "Their lacking diligence has undoubtedly caused the collision. Distress calls have been made." 
MURPHY Collision? With what? 
EPPS The page's missing. Then their SOS was real. 
MURPHY But where's the damage? 
EPPS Maybe the other ship took the worst of it. 
MURPHY If it was a ship she hit. 
A beat as they hold there, when his radio CRACKLES TO LIFE. 
DODGE Dodge to Murphy! 
Murphy reaches down for his radio. 
MURPHY (to radio) Yeah. 
DODGE You better get down here right now! We're taking water! Big time! 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY 
Murphy and Epps jump from the deck crane as the tug is starting to list to one side. He crosses to the deck house and the open engine room hatch to see that it is rapidly filling with seawater as Greer and Dodge scramble to set a pump hose over the DIN OF THE PUMPS. 
MURPHY What the hell happened! 
DODGE Turbine chamber on number two must've blown! Took out part of the hull! 
GREER We're not gonna be able to pump it! 
MURPHY Alright. Everybody grab your gear! This' is where we get off! 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
The tug is listing radically to the side, its deck awash with seawater, as Epps, Greer, and Murphy scramble with their gear to the crane. 
Water is starting to pour out of the deckhouse hatch as the towering framework rising over the pilothouse stabs precariously at the bow of the Chimera. 
Murphy stops to shout back at the deckhouse. 
MURPHY Dodge! 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - CREW QUARTERS - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Water is starting to pour in as the entire cabin lurches to one side. Dodge wades through toward the door. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Epps pulls herself up onto the deck, Greer following behind, then Murphy. 
Dodge can be seen stepping from the deckhouse on the tug, which now lists at a near 45 degree angle. 
WITH DODGE 
Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the starboard rail. 
He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up and edges his way toward the bow. 
WITH THE OTHERS 
Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the skewed deck crane. 
WITH DODGE 
The tug is slowly lurching over as Dodge climbs the crane, the top of which is sweeping away from the Chimera. 
Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it sinks lower and lower. 
WITH THE OTHERS 
They look on as Dodge climbs toward them, the sinking tug pulling Dodge and the crane away from the ship. 
Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing. 
WITH DODGE 
EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT 
A fire burns in an oil drum as Epps, Murphy, Dodge and Greer sit around it in silence. 
INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT 
Epps steps in. She shines her light on the room. It is exactly as it was left. She crosses to the bed, shining her light under it. She sits down, trying it. 
INT. CHIMERA - CARGO HOLD - NIGHT 
Dodge moves in the darkness, coming to the corner where the stacked gold ingots rest. He looks on at them. 
MURPHY (O.S.) You shouldn't be down here alone. 
Dodge turns to see Murphy standing there. 
DODGE Just wanted to check on our little baby. 
A beat as they look on at the gold. 
DODGE That oughta buy a man pretty much anything he wants. 
MURPHY If money can buy what he wants. 
DODGE I don't figure there's much I want money can't buy. 
MURPHY Then you're a lucky man. 
Murphy tosses the shotgun to Dodge, who catches it. 
MURPHY We'll stand the watch on deck tonight. You're up first. 
DODGE Right. 
Murphy holds there a beat longer, then turns to go, as Dodge looks after him. 
EXT. CHIMERA - DAY 
A grey chop gently rocks the Chimera, smoke rising from the top deck. 
EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY 
Greer and Dodge tend the flames of three fire barrels, adding broken up furniture to create heavy signal smoke. 
INT. CHIMERA - PANTRY - DAY 
Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, scavenging for food. 
INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY 
Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway. 
EPPS Murphy? 
No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the galley. Nothing. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry to the swimming pool. She walks on. 
INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY 
Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls. She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool. 
Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her clothing hanging loosely from a frail body. 
GIRL You must leave. 
A beat as Epps stands there. 
EPPS (finally) Who are you? 
From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully discern the girl's features. 
GIRL There's great evil here, more than you can know. Leave now or you may never leave. 
EPPS But -- 
A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look. When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising up from the bottom. 
She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles. 
As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear that the water is not water at all but blood. 
And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up. Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams. 
Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood. 
EPPS My God.... 
Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far apart. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook it on its wind gauge. 
ON THE BUOY 
The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Murphy corrects. 
EPPS Higher. You're gonna miss it. 
Murphy holds the loop steady. 
ON THE BUOY 
The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes down. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Murphy yanks on the line. 
ON THE BUOY 
And the loop catches on the wind gauge. 
BACK TO SCENE 
As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy heels over as it's pulled. 
ON THE BUOY 
It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with a huge BOOMING CLANG. 
BACK TO SCENE 
The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing bowing a little with the weight as they look on. 
GREER We're still drifting. 
MURPHY The mooring hasn't come taught. 
EPPS It's not gonna hold us. 
MURPHY Doesn't matter. 
ON THE BUOY 
As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high. 
The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water. 
BACK TO SCENE 
The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own mooring. 
ON THE BUOY 
The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend. 
BACK TO SCENE 
As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable. 
DODGE No fucking way. 
ON THE BUOY 
The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain of spray, whipping wildly from side to side. 
BACK TO SCENE 
The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera. 
MURPHY Damn it. 
They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the ship drifts away. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT 
Murphy stands watch by the fire as Epps joins him. 
EPPS Hey. 
MURPHY Hey. 
EPPS Couldn't sleep. 
MURPHY Wish I could say the same. 
EPPS Dodge. (no answer, knocking again) Dodge. 
DODGE (O.S.) (finally, from inside) What? 
EPPS Get up. 
DODGE (O.S.) Yeah, yeah. 
INT. CHIMERA - 4TH OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT 
Epps sits down on the bed. She lies back, not sleepy. A beat as she holds there in the darkness. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT 
Murphy still sits by the fire as Dodge groggily approaches from the officers quarters, carrying a blanket and a jug of water. 
MURPHY You're late. 
DODGE Sorry. 
MURPHY (handing him the shotgun) Don't fall asleep. 
DODGE (laying out his blanket) Right. 
INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT 
Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FOREDECK - NIGHT 
Dodge dozes, cradling the shotgun in his arms, when MUSIC CAN BE HEARD VERY DISTANTLY. Dodge wakes. It is "Daisy" playing on a music box somewhere in the ship. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 
Dodge moves along as the MUSIC BOX DISTANTLY CONTINUES. 
INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT 
Dodge moves cautiously down the stairway into another passageway. 
He approaches from the other end. He passes the open doors of stateroom after stateroom. The MUSIC BOX IS CLOSER HERE. It stops. 
He holds there in the darkness. He turns, shining his light back down the passageway. A beat. It is silent, when the CHANNEL OF HIS RADIO OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST. 
He raises his radio. But no one says anything, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, a discernible presence on the other end. 
DODGE Dodge. 
SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END 
SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the other end of the passageway. 
BACK TO SCENE 
He gets no response, then presses the talk button. 
DODGE This is Dodge. Over. 
He is answered by silence, the CHANNEL REMAINING OPEN, WHEN THE GRAVELLY DISTORTED VOICE THAT MURPHY HEARD COMES BACK ON THE RADIO: 
VOICE "Cock-a-doodle-doo," said the rooster to the crow. "Where are you now? I know but won't say so." 
Dodge hits the talk button. 
DODGE Who is this? 
The RADIO CHANNEL OPENS, but only silence comes back. 
DODGE Identify yourself, motherfucker! 
SOMEONE'S POV - FROM THE FAR END 
SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD DODGE as he can be seen from the far end of the passageway. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Only silence returns on the radio as Dodge holds there, then: 
VOICE Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy. 
THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN ON DODGE as he listens. 
VOICE Penny whistle toy. Penny whistle toy -- 
Dodge senses something behind him. He turns, and before he can draw a breath to shout, SOMETHING HEAVY SLAMS INTO HIM IN THE DARKNESS, his flashlight tumbling away in a squiggle of light. 
ON SHOTGUN 
As the shotgun clatters to the deck, the muzzle resting in frame as the radio falls a few feet away. A beat. The shotgun muzzle slides out of frame as some unseen person or thing pulls it away. 
EXT. CHIMERA - DAY 
Epps stops, holding there in the silence. She reaches for her radio. The WHISPERING SOUNDS AGAIN. Epps turns to pinpoint it, coming from somewhere in the cavernous space. 
INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD, then stops. 
It is absolutely silent. In the darkness behind her, the GIRL (KATIE) PULLS BACK INTO THE SHADOWS. 
Epps holds there a beat, then turns, running into Greer with a start. 
GREER Sorry. Didn't mean to scare you. 
She holds there a beat, looking around. 
GREER You okay? 
EPPS Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all. 
GREER What? 
EPPS Nothing. Let's get outa here. 
They start to leave, when Epps notices something. She stops. 
Beyond the standpipes, a faint glow can be seen in the darkness. Epps steps forward, crossing to it. Greer follows. 
MOVING WITH EPPS 
As Epps approaches, Greer behind her. The light is dim and low to the deck. She stops. 
WITH THE LIGHT 
As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still on. 
She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the darkness and starts off, Greer following. 
INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight. 
It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear. 
She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to see that it is blood. 
She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them from the darkness. 
He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging limp beside it. 
INT. CHIMERA - BELOW DECKS - LATER - DAY 
Greer and Murphy lower Dodge's body on a rope as Epps guides it to the deck. They stand looking on at it a moment. 
GREER Can't find the shotgun. 
MURPHY So whoever did this now has our shotgun. 
GREER Doesn't look like it much matters. 
EPPS What do we do with him? 
MURPHY Leave him till we can get some help. (a beat) From now on, nobody comes down here. 
GREER What about the gold? 
MURPHY Leave it. 
GREER Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here. 
MURPHY You think whoever did this is reasonable? 
GREER All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was. 
EPPS I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share. 
GREER I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this. 
MURPHY Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it. (a beat) You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that. 
GREER Fine with me. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - DAY 
Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where Greer was found, room 400. 
She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. She opens it. 
INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting room in the front, is a bedroom. 
Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall. 
Murphy slams the door shut as Epps looks on. She puts a steel pipe across the hatch lever so that it cannot be opened. 
INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - LATER - DAY 
Greer sits in the tank, visible through a large piece of armored aquarium glass, amidst the fake coral. He sits in the sand hugging his legs to his chest, bobbing slightly as he speaks in his nonsensical language. 
MURPHY (V.O.) Must've been him all along. 
Murphy and Epps look on from the outside in the promenade. 
MURPHY Smashed the radio. Scuttled the boat. Killed Dodge. Would've killed you. He's off his nut, no doubt there. 
They watch him in silence a moment as Greer mutters and bobs. 
MURPHY What do you think? 
EPPS Could be a stroke. Who knows? (a beat) The general log said the crew were fighting among themselves. "Like wild dogs." 
MURPHY Over the gold. 
EPPS Maybe it was more than that. 
Greer gets up, comes to the window, looking out at them. He presses his face to the glass. 
EPPS They went crazy. 
MURPHY Crazy with greed. Not crazy. Not like him. 
A beat as Epps looks off. In the window Greer drags his hideously distorted face over the glass, the blood from his wounds smearing in broad red streaks. 
EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY 
A partial hull of a rotting life boat falls into frame. Epps and Murphy stand over it. 
MURPHY We lash a few of these together it might get us far enough into the shipping lanes to be rescued. 
A beat as they look on at the rotting hull. 
MURPHY Hard to say which is worse, staying here or taking our chances in open water. 
EPPS If the weather holds it might not be so bad. 
MURPHY It's not the weather I'm worried about. The wrong current could drag us as far as the Aleutians before we come across another boat. 
EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - DAY 
Epps and Murphy work to lash parts of the rotting boats into a single usable raft. 
INT. CHIMERA - AQUARIUM TANK - DAY 
Greer lies asleep on the sand bottom of the tank, the white light from the skylight falling on him from above. 
INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE AREA - DAY 
Epps has found a reel of wire and some metal braces, making her way into the darkness, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then closes. She stops, raises the radio. 
EPPS (holding down talk button) Murphy? 
She waits, holding there as only silence comes back. 
EPPS Murphy, this is Epps. Do you copy? 
Again, only silence comes back until, after a moment, the channel opens again. No one speaks, though there is a palpable presence on the other end. 
EPPS (raising the radio) Who is this? 
The channel opens again, only silence returning. The sound of the MUSIC BOX CAN BE HEARD, "DAISY" COMING BACK OVER THE RADIO. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps walks along in the darkness AS THE MUSIC BOX CONTINUES TO PLAY OVER THE RADIO. She comes to the end of the corridor, stopping there. 
At the other end the light falls from the door at room 400. 
The MUSIC FROM THE RADIO STOPS, leaving in its absence the MUSIC AS IT CAN BE HEARD COMING FROM THE ROOM AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps approaches the other end, from where the MUSIC EMANATES, coming to a stop at room 400. A beat as she holds there. 
INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Epps steps in as THE MUSIC BOX PLAYS IN THE OTHER ROOM. 
The sitting room is dark as she holds there. After a moment, she continues on, coming to the bedroom. 
Epps steps in. Across the room the MUSIC BOX IS PLAYING. 
She crosses, coming to it as it continues, when her radio CRACKLES TO LIFE. The channel remains silent a moment, then: 
VOICE "Cock-a-doodle-doo, said the rooster to the crow. Where are you now? I know but won't say so." 
EPPS (V.O.) NO!!!! 
BACK TO SCENE 
The CAMERA STOPS ON KATIE standing on the other side of the room, now empty of people, returned to its shabby, abandoned state. 
KATIE It isn't real. 
Epps looks back at her from the other side of the room where she stands. 
KATIE Many bad things have happened here. But you mustn't allow the evil inside. I tell you this because you can see me. The others can't. But you must leave. You must leave. 
A LOUD GUNSHOT SOUNDS SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. When Epps turns back Katie is gone. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps moves quickly along, raising her radio. 
MURPHY Epps to Murphy. 
Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK. 
EPPS Epps to Murphy. 
Only WHITE NOISE COMES BACK as she rounds the corner out onto the promenade. At the other end, the aquarium can be seen. 
As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken out. 
A GREAT BOOMING SHUDDER rocks the ship. A LOUD SCREECHING OF METAL follows it. 
EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The ship's hull being scraped at the waterline by a jagged mid-ocean island no bigger than fifty or sixty feet across. 
The ship has entered a small archipelago of such islands, a mine field for a drifting ship. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps moves quickly along, coming to the stairway, moving up, almost running into Murphy on his way down, carrying a canvas duffle. 
EPPS What happened? 
MURPHY We hit land. 
EPPS What? 
MURPHY We're in an island chain. It's only a matter of time before we hit another one. 
EPPS Greer's gone. He broke out of the tank. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps and Murphy move quickly along, when another HUGE BOOMING shudders the ship and the SHRIEKING OF METAL follows. 
EXT. CHIMERA - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
The ship bounces off another of the small, jagged islands as it drifts past, buckling the steel plate of the hull precariously. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the passage some distance down. 
AT THE OTHER END 
Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face down in the passage. 
They step up. Epps kneels as Murphy looks on. She rolls the body over. It is Greer, dead. 
EPPS He's been shot. 
Murphy kneels too, looking on at Greer's lifeless eyes. 
MURPHY Let's get the hell out of here. 
INT. CHIMERA - STAIRWAY/PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Murphy and Epps come up the stairway, crossing to the doors. 
EXT. CHIMERA - FORWARD DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
As Epps and Murphy come out, moving toward the make-do raft. 
MURPHY It should be enough to get us to one of those islands. Gimme a hand, wouldya? 
She joins him and they lift it off its stand, taking it to the rail. 
MURPHY Prop it here. We need to pull these braces off. There's a hammer on the stand. There. 
Epps crosses back to the stands. 
AT THE STANDS

FADE IN: 
1   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                         1 
CLOSE ON - A YOUNG WOMAN'S EYE. Bloodshot blue. Her eyelashes tremble. A tear rolls out. She blinks. 
CLOSE ON - A filthy, coarse rope secures a dirty rag inside her mouth. 
CLOSE ON - The same type rope binds her ankles together. 
CLOSE ON HER HANDS - A mixture of blood, dirt.   IRON SPIKES ARE NAILED THROUGH HER PALMS. 
FROM ABOVE - The Young Woman, 20s, wearing a handmade dress with a small crest embroidered over the heart, lies nailed to a wooden table. 
AN OVERHEAD LIGHT BULB DIMS, CRACKLES.    OFF SCREEN: A BLOOD- CURDLING SCREAM cries out. 
The Young Woman's breathing intensifies.   She watches the light bulb, listens to the screams. 
The light bulb returns to normal. The screams stop.    Peace for a moment. But she knows that won't last. 
2   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                         2 
A YOUNG MAN, 20s, hangs by his wrists from iron shackles secured to the ceiling. He's bloodied, bruised... a mess. 
CLOSE ON - The end of a pair of jumper cables. They TOUCH, sending SPARKS into the air. Brought together by... 
A CONCEALED FIGURE. All that's visible are his hands.    His left hand is SEVERELY BURNED, SCARRED, while his right appears normal. He touches the jumper cables together again... SPARKS FLY. 
YOUNG MAN Please-please stop. D-don't. 
The Concealed Figure ignores his pleas, connects the left cable to one shackle chain... and then the right side. 
ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE BODY OF THE YOUNG MAN. HIS BODY CONTORTS. HE SCREAMS. The lights DIM and CRACKLE. 
3   INT. TORTURE ROOM #1                                           3 
CLOSE ON - The light bulb DULLS.   The screams of the Young Man echo through the room. 
The Young Woman closes her eyes. Takes SEVERAL FAST BREATHS then... MUSTERS every ounce of strength in her body and... 
Her right hand TREMBLES... The Young Woman GRIMACES, in unbelievable agony, but then... HER RIGHT HAND INCHES UP THE IRON SPIKE. Slowly and painfully. PIECES OF BLOOD, SKIN and BONE cling to spike as the hand moves up. 
The light bulb returns again to normal.   The screams stop. 
The Young Woman gives a final hard push and...   FREES HER RIGHT HAND. Blood pours from the wound. 
No time to waste. She turns her attention, strength to her left hand... ever-so-slowly (and painfully) it moves. 
4   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                            4 
CLOSE ON - The jumper cable attaches to the metal and... ELECTRICITY SURGES THROUGH THE YOUNG MAN'S body. HE SCREAMS. 
5   INT.   CABIN - TORTURE ROOM #1                                    5 
The Young Woman's left hand POPS free.    Blood oozes out. 
OFF SCREEN: SCREAMS FROM THE YOUNG MAN. 
She sits up, goes for the gag, but her fingers cramp in pain. Finally, she unties the knot, removes the gag. She coughs, tries to muffle the noise best she can. 
The SCREAMS STOP.   Lights return to normal. 
Half way free. She goes for the ropes at her ankles, unties them, slides off the table. She grabs a couple rags, ties them around her palm's wounds. 
6   INT.   HALLWAY/ TORTURE ROOM #2                                   6 
The Young Woman opens the door, checks to see if the coast is clear. It is. 
We're at the end of a long, dark hallway (more like a tunnel, really). There are two more doors in the hall, one in front of her another to her right. The door across from her is slightly ajar... 
YOUNG WOMAN'S POV THRU DOOR - The Young Man dangles from the chains. Suddenly, the Concealed Figure appears between the door and the Young Man. 
The Young Woman retreats, but realizes the Concealed Figure has his back to her. 
THE YOUNG MAN sees past the Figure, LOCKS EYES with the Young Woman. No hope for himself, his eyes say: Save yourself. 
The Young Woman fights back tears, mouths the words "I Love you". She carefully opens the door to her right, REVEAL a rickety set of wooden steps. She heads up, just as... 
LIGHTS FLICKER.     OFF SCREEN: The Young Man SCREAMS again. 
MIKE Come on.   Next one. 
Sheryl scrolls again, hits play. 
MIKE "Bullets" by the Editors. 
Sheryl frowns.   Mike grins and shoots her a wink. 
SHERYL You loaded these songs. You don't need to be so impressed with yourself. 
MIKE I know I don't have to be. 
SHERYL I haven't even heard of half these bands. 
MIKE It's called good music. You should try to familiarize yourself with it, instead of listening to the crap you do. 
SHERYL I listen to crap? 
MIKE Hurts me to be the one to tell you. 
SHERYL I'm sure it does. 
MIKE You gotta be more like me, baby. Think new, fresh, cutting edge. I'm looking for the next Beatles, U2 or Radiohead. 
Sheryl scans through the MP3 player, spots one and smiles. 
SHERYL So, where does this band fall into that group? 
The music starts. BOY'S DON'T CRY, "I WANT TO BE A COWBOY" blares. 
SHERYL Fresh, new or cutting edge? 
Mike immediately begins to backtrack. 
MIKE How'd that get on there? 
SHERYL You loaded the songs.   You tell me? 
MIKE Must be a mistake. 
SHERYL Says here you've listened to it 86 times. 
Busted. 
SHERYL Is this true? Have you always wanted to be a cowboy? 
Sheryl spies more... 
SHERYL You also got "Men Without Hats" greatest hits? I didn't know they qualified for a greatest hits album. Can you break me off a little "Safety Dance"? 
Mike reaches for the MP3 player. 
MIKE Okay, give me that. 
The Passat speeds past a "West Virginia" state sign. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          7. 
16   EXT.   NATIONAL PARK ENTRANCE - DAY                           16 
The sun BURNS above.   The Passat turns into the park. 
17   EXT.   PARKING LOT, RANGER STATION - DAY                      17 
The Passat rolls into a dirt parking lot. Next to the lot is the Ranger Station. 
18   INT.   RANGER BASE STATION - DAY                              18 
Maps and local artifacts adorn the walls. A display of some of the local animals, stuffed of course, including a giant bear, fill in the gaps. 
Mike and Sheryl enter. They take in the place. Mike heads toward the Ranger's desk while Sheryl eyes the decor. 
SAM, 65, a round-faced RANGER with a grumpy disposition, a hearing aid in his right ear, sits behind a desk. He continues working, scribbling on something as Sheryl and Mike wait. And wait. Then... 
MIKE Good morning. 
Sam holds up a "wait a second" finger.     After a beat... 
SAM Now what can I do you two for? 
Sheryl spots some fliers tacked to a bulletin board. Hiking gear for sale, Tour Info, National Park History, etc. 
MIKE Well...ah... 
SAM First time here and you're not quite sure where to begin. 
Sheryl grabs a National Park Information flier. 
Sheryl checks her bag as well. She clips a blue hikers' towel to her waist. Mike checks his cell phone. No service. 
MIKE You getting anything? 
Sheryl checks her phone and shakes her head "no." 
MIKE I'll lock them in the car. 
SHERYL I'll take mine. 
MIKE Why? 
SHERYL Just to annoy you. 
MIKE Seriously... 
SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006         11. 
SHERYL In an emergency, I'd rather have a phone that may not work up there, than not have a phone that may work up there. 
Huh? Mike shakes his head, puts his phone in the glove compartment. 
Sheryl tucks her phone and the flier into a side pocket of her backpack. Zips it shut. 
ANGLE ON - Mike's keys and his Boston Red Sox key chain. Mike locks the door. 
MIKE Okay, we all set? 
SHERYL (Excited) Yup. 
MIKE Let's do this. 
Mike pulls on his backpack, starts walking. Sheryl doesn't move. She eyes their tent still resting on the car's roof. 
SHERYL Hey, Einstein. What do you think, leave the tent or maybe take it with us? 
Mike swallows his pride and retreats to the car. 
MIKE I was just seeing if you were paying attention. 
Mike comes back to the car for the tent.   Sheryl shakes her head and smiles. 
21   EXT.   BASE TRAIL #1 - DAY                                   21 
The mountain is breathtaking.    Nature at its best. 
Mike and Sheryl have begun their ascent. 
SHERYL It could be fun. 
MIKE Not a chance. High School reunions serve only two purposes... to try to (MORE) 
MIKE (cont'd) rehash so-called glory days if you were popular or to gloat if you were a spaz and are now filthy rich, banging a super-model. 
SHERYL So what were you? 
MIKE Me?   I was a stoner. 
SHERYL So what does that mean? 
MIKE How the hell am I supposed to remember? I was high all the time. 
Sheryl swallows some water, checks her compass. 
Sweat rolls down Mike's forehead, stinging his eyes. Sheryl doesn't have that problem. She's wearing a red bandana. 
MIKE Where'd you get that bandana? 
SHERYL It's cute, right? I stopped by that Army-Navy store on Grover yesterday. Keeps the sweat out of your eyes. 
MIKE And when you were buying it, you didn't think that maybe... 
SHERYL Oh...well...it was the last one... 
MIKE The last one? 
SHERYL Yeah... 
MIKE The entire Army-Navy store... sold out? 
SHERYL Completely. There was some sort of run on bandanas at the last minute. 
Sheryl stifles a CHUCKLE. Mike shakes his head, then... she pulls out a GRAY BANDANA, hands it to him. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT               OCTOBER 17, 2006   13. 
SHERYL Here... You big baby. 
SHERYL When I see an opening. 
MIKE (Checks map) That path she was talking about winds through these falls. What do you think? 
SHERYL I think... if you get eaten by a bear and there isn't a Ranger around, I'm not carrying what's left of you down this mountain. 
MIKE And they say romance is dead. (Smiling wide) Timber Falls it is. 
They throw on their backpacks and head on their way. 
MIKE Who's Lewis and/or Clark? 
SHERYL You really were stoned through high school. 
As Mike and Sheryl trek up the path... 
ANGLE ON - The directional sign, "Timber Falls" 
23   EXT.   TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #1 - DAY                              23 
Looking back down on the thin path. FIND - Sheryl and Mike continuing their trek. (SPLINTER UNIT) 
Mike maneuvers around a massive tree. He freezes. Gestures for Sheryl to be quiet and mouths the words, "Don't Move." 
Sheryl stops, startled.     Mike motions towards... 
A MOUNTAIN STAG, with magnificent antlers, chews on a plant in the distance. 
Sheryl quietly slides out her digital camera.    Snaps a photo of the animal. 
The Stag stops chewing and looks at them.    After a long beat, the Stag skips away through the trees. 
Sheryl watches the animal disappear, smiles. 
Mike removes his backpack and crosses to Sheryl. He helps remove her backpack and kisses her. She kisses him back. 
ANGLE ON - Sheryl's heart-shaped locket through her shirt. 
MIKE You're going to lose that out here. 
SHERYL It's fine. I never take it off. Not since you gave it to me. Betcha don't remember... 
MIKE ...February 27, 2006. 
Sheryl stares incredulously, romantically at Mike. Speechless. 
MIKE I remember every moment with you. 
SHERYL I've got you so whipped. 
They kiss. Sheryl climbs onto Mike's lap. He leans back, better positioning, places his hand down, when... 
MIKE OUCH!   FUCK! 
Mike brings his hand back up.    BLOOD trickles out of a SMALL CUT across his palm. 
SHERYL What? 
MIKE My hand... Something stuck it. 
Sheryl quickly examines the cut. Mike quickly becomes flustered, woozy. He turns away from the wound. 
SHERYL It's okay. It's not too deep.      Let me get the first aid kit. 
Sheryl rummages through her bag. Mike, in more psychological discomfort than physical, looks away wincing. 
Sheryl returns, wipes the blood away best she can.    She applies some peroxide... 
MIKE Fuck.   That stung. 
SHERYL Gotta clean the wound, baby. 
24   OBSCURED POV - THROUGH TREES--                                24 
From a distance... A SICKLE BLADE enters frame, pulls a branch aside. Sheryl attends to Mike's wound. 
The POV narrows... solely on SHERYL. 
25   TIMBER FALLS, TRAIL #1--                                      25 
Mike looks at Sheryl, a twinge of embarrassment in his eyes. 
MIKE You know me and blood... we don't do so well. 
SHERYL I know. (She finishes) All done. 
OFF SCREEN: CRUNCH of something stepping on a thicket. 
Okay, he had that coming. 
MIKE Truce? 
SHERYL Truce. 
He takes her in.   She's quite a sight. He sits down next to her. They kiss.    Then... Mike breaks the embrace. 
MIKE Don't disappear on me again. 
Sheryl mouths the words, "I promise."    Crosses her heart. 
He leans in, they kiss again.   Soft and sweet at first.   Then it deepens. 
Sheryl rubs his chest and removes his shirt. They kiss again. Harder this time. Their hands all over one another. 
Mike slides his hand under Sheryl's panties, between her legs. She moans softly. Sheryl unhooks her bra and is about to remove it, when: 
DARRYL (O.S.) Hey, Brody, Lonnie. Check this out. 
DARRYL, 30, a skinny local with a twisted smile and LONNIE, 20's, a slob, emerge from the forest. They are followed by... 
BRODY, 35, scruffy and unshaven, their ringleader. Brody clutches a shotgun in one hand and a weathered sack in the other. 
DARRYL Looks like we got ourselves a little party. 
Brody and Darryl ogle Sheryl. She tucks herself behind Mike, who shifts quickly into protective mode. She snaps her bra back closed. 
MIKE We were just moving our way up the mountain. 
LONNIE You were moving your way'round more than just that. 
Sheryl eyes her discarded clothes.   Darryl spots them too. He grabs the shorts, SNIFFS them. 
DARRYL (Referring to the smell) Like a peach. 
Mike tries to seem relaxed and friendly. 
BRODY You folks best be careful about what you do up here... Never know who's watching. 
MIKE Appreciate the advice...I think we learned our lesson. 
Brody nods as he looks them up and down. 
LONNIE You city folk, ain't ya? Up from Charleston roughing it, seeing how the "other" half lives? 
MIKE No, we're from Virginia, just up for a weekend trip. And, uh... you folks live up here? 
Brody glances at Darryl and Lonnie, then back at Mike. 
BRODY It's easy to spot the city folk. It's like they're trying to be friendly, when really they don't want to be. 
MIKE I think you just startled us is all. 
Sheryl looks over at... 
...Lonnie sticks his tongue between his fingers, rapidly flails it about. 
Uncomfortable silence. 
MIKE We'll just be on our way. (Re: Sheryl's shorts) May I have those? 
A bold move from Mike. 
DARRYL Finders keepers. 
Long beat.    Tension high. 
BRODY Darryl. 
Brody concedes, gestures to Darryl to give the shorts back. 
Darryl reluctantly obliges. 
Mike passes them to Sheryl who slides them on. Darryl and Lonnie soak in every inch of Sheryl as she does. 
Mike takes Sheryl's hand. They make a move, but... Brody stops them with the barrel of his shotgun. 
BRODY Where you runnin' off to? 
LONNIE Yeah, we just getting acquainted and shit. 
Mike glances down at the barrel that runs across his chest. He can no longer hide his fear. 
MIKE We just want to get a little further along before the sun sets. 
Darryl eyes the sky.    The sun beams down through the trees. 
Mike gets up, grabs his bag and follows Sheryl. 
27   EXT.   MOUNTAINS - DAY (2ND UNIT)                             27 
The sun begins to set, basking the mountain range in a magnificent light. 
28   EXT.   WATERFALL - TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #2 - DAY                28 
Mike and Sheryl move right along.     Still not speaking. 
The path forks at a BEAUTIFUL WATERFALL. Mike stops, faces the falls, turns to see... Sheryl behind him, catching up. As she does, she slips... 
MIKE You alright? 
SHERYL (balances herself) Yeah. 
She's about to walk past him, but he reaches for Sheryl's hand and holds it. 
MIKE I'm sorry. 
SHERYL Do you know how many times I've had someone die on me? How many children? I stopped keeping count. 
MIKE I thought... I wasn't thinking.       What do you want me to do? 
SHERYL Get rid of the gun. 
MIKE What... now? Out here? 
She holds firm. 
MIKE I can't just leave it here in the woods, some kid could find it. 
SHERYL Then get rid of the bullets now and when we get home, you get rid of the gun. 
Mike thinks about it.    His instincts SCREAMING not to do this, then... 
SHERYL Please. 
Mike relents. He removes his backpack, ZIPS it open.    He pulls out the gun, opens it, spills the bullets out. 
Mike WITH A DEEP BREATH, TOSSES THE BULLETS into the woods. 
SHERYL Was that all of them? 
MIKE Yes. 
Mike steps back to Sheryl, they hug. 
SHERYL Thank you. 
CRACK! A strange sound, like wood snapping, startles Sheryl. Mike turns as well. Their eyes WIDEN. 
CRACK! The FIGURE emerges from the clearing, practically landing on top of them. It's... 
CLYDE, a Park Ranger, mid-50's, friendly. He's got a weed cutter in his hands, wears a PAIR OF WORK GLOVES. He's just as surprised to see them. 
Sheryl and Mike breath a sigh and offer him a smile. 
CLYDE Oh. Didn't mean to startle you folks. Just clearing some of the brush off (MORE) 
SHOOTING SCRIPT        OCTOBER 17, 2006    28. 
CLYDE (cont'd) the path. We had some heavy rains this past week, knocked some trees and branches down. One of the new recruits was supposed to do yesterday, but... if you want something done right, you gotta do it yourself. 
MIKE It's fine. We were led to believe this trail wasn't regularly patrolled. 
CLYDE It's not, but... It's one of my favorite spots, so I often find an excuse to swing by. 
SHERYL It's gorgeous. 
CLYDE Yup. There are a couple more falls in the park, but none quite so... inviting as this one. Now don't take my word for it, you can see for yourself... How long's your stay? 
SHERYL Just til Sunday. 
CLYDE Yeah, no. The other falls are clear on the other side. It would take you a couple nights just to get there. 
SHERYL Maybe next time. 
MIKE This is a quickie trip. Just getting out of the city for a couple days. 
CLYDE The city, huh. Which? If it's Charleston, I wouldn't blame ya. Whole place smells like feet. I gotta haul myself all the way down to the hospital there for my yearly because the darn HMO's rules and regulations won't let me visit the local Doc. Not my cup of tea at all, but if you like it there, then... 
SHERYL No, we're not from Charleston. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006             29. 
MIKE But apparently we look like we are. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
33   EXT.   FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT                                 33 
STARS FILL THE SKY. Crickets chirp, but aside from that, peace and quiet reign. 
A fire CRACKLES. A tent for two has been pitched. Dirty pots, pans litter the area. Dinner's over and done. 
Mike and Sheryl cuddle by the fire.   A sleeping bag wrapped around them. 
MIKE That was... the worst dinner ever. 
SHERYL (Beat) You cooked. 
MIKE Yeah, I'm aware. (Beat) You know what would make this evening perfect? Moonshine. I got a whole jar of it. There's a sentence I never thought I'd say. "I have a jar of moonshine." Matter of fact, I've got enough to share with our entire congregation... 
SHERYL ... in Charleston. 
MIKE Our home city, of course. But I should start with you... Would you like some moonshine? 
Sheryl smiles, shakes her head playfully. 
MIKE Then what would you like? 
SHERYL I'd like to fuck you. 
MIKE Not very Christian of you. 
SHERYL I'm more Old Testament. 
MIKE What's that mean? 
SHERYL Not sure. But I think it's the nastier of the two books. 
Sheryl pulls Mike into her, they kiss. Strong and deep. Sheryl abruptly breaks the kiss, enough foreplay. She stands up, pulls Mike into the tent with her. 
34   INT.   TENT - NIGHT                                            34 
Sheryl pulls off her sweatshirt, then the T-shirt.    Mike kicks off his shoes, drops his pants. 
Mike unbuttons Sheryl's jeans, tugs them off. 
Sheryl unhooks her bra, tosses it aside.    Mike slides her panties down her legs and off. 
Few things in life can be described as perfect.         Sheryl's naked body is one of them. 
Sheryl pulls Mike's boxers down, climbs on top of him.        She reaches down and slides Mike inside her. 
Sheryl KISSES Mike. He slides his hands around Sheryl's butt. Sheryl paws his chest, bites his lower lip HARD. 
The lovers move in unison.    Perfection. 
35     EXT.   TENT - FIVE CORNERS - NIGHT                                 35 
Inside the tent, Mike and Sheryl continue.      Their campfire still burns. Suddenly... 
A SHADOW creeps into frame.    Then a BOOT.    Someone's outside their tent. 
36     INT. TENT - NIGHT                                                  36 
Breaths get shorter, stronger. Sheryl and Mike build to climax. They don't/ can't notice... 
A SHADOW passes across the wall of the tent. 
The last final moments before... climax. The lovers EXHALE. Sheryl crashes on top of Mike. He wraps his arms tightly around her. 
TIME CUT TO: 
36 A   EXT.   TENT - NIGHT                                            36 A 
The last FLAMES on the fire slowly BURN OUT. 
36 B   INT.   TENT - NIGHT                                            36 B 
Mike and Sheryl spoon, their hands and fingers messed together as one. 
MIKE I was good. I mean, even better than usual. 
SHERYL If you don't say so... 
MIKE ... if I don't say so myself, yeah. Top notch performance. What, you disagree? 
SHERYL Nah, it was good.   Do you think I had anything to do... 
MIKE No.   All me. 
SHERYL Fine. (Beat; cautious) I liked what the old woman said about us earlier. 
In the wash of the waves, sparkling in the sunlight. It's Sheryl's locket. The chain broken. He picks it up... 
MIKE (Calls out) Sheryl! 
Mike looks around. He's completely alone.     The blood drains from his face. Mike pockets the necklace. 
He starts into the water... did she drown?    Just as he gets knee deep... 
OFF SCREEN: A SCREAM CRIES OUT! 
Mike stops, turns back looking at the forest. 
MIKE Sheryl! 
He hustles out of the water, heading for the woods. 
45   EXT.   WOODS NEAR STREAM - DAY                                  45 
Mike hustles through the thick patch of trees and hits the steep little slope. He flies up the slope but loses traction and slips, BANGING his knee. 
MIKE Fuck! (Top of his lungs) Sheryl! 
Mike pushes himself up, continues on. 
46   EXT.   WOODS NEAR STREAM #2 - DAY                               46 
Mike's really moving now. He scoots through the first patch of trees and hustles down a slope. 
47   EXT.   CLEARING, TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                       47 
Mike emerges from the woods, drops into a clearing.        Looking around wildly... 
POV OF MIKE - Has he been here before? It all looks the same? Not even sure which direction he just came from. 
MIKE Sheryl! 
Still nothing.   Mike swallows.     What to do now? 
SMASH CUT TO: 
48   EXT.   WOODS #1 - OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                  48 
TIGHT ON MIKE as he races through the trees.     HIS LEGS trample over rocks, dirt, shrubs. Then... 
Mike TRIPS, falls down HARD. He lifts his forearm to reveal BLOOD, SCRAPES and a LONG SHARP SPLINTER sticking out. 
The sight of it almost makes Mike puke right then and there. 
Mike grabs hold of the splinter, turns his head... takes about a thousand short quick breaths and... PULLS THE SPLINTER OUT! BLOOD SQUIRTS ACROSS HIS FACE. 
He removes the GRAY BANDANA from his back pocket, wraps it around his wound. 
Mike lays back, stares up into the sky.     Tries to catch his breath, calm down. Then... 
Faint sound of LAUGHTER. 
Mike sits up.     Again, faint sound of LAUGHTER. 
Mike stands, takes a couple of steps toward the sound. MORE LAUGHTER. Mike's got the scent, takes off in its direction. 
49   EXT.   WOODS #2, OFF TIMBER FALLS TRAIL - DAY                  49 
Mike follows the VOICES through a thick patch of trees.     He stops at the top and looks down. 
POV OF MIKE - Walking along the main path, obscured by the trees, is Darryl and Lonnie. They drink, LAUGH about something. Lonnie carries some fishing poles. 
Mike's about fifteen feet above them.      He narrows his focus in on... 
MIKE'S POV - Darryl twirling something in his hand.     It's Sheryl's blue hikers' towel. 
Mike turns red with fury.    He looks back down... 
MIKE'S POV - Darryl, a SHOTGUN slung around his shoulder. 
Mike looks around and spots a large pointed stick lying near a tree, parallel to him. 
50   EXT.   TIMBER FALLS TRAIL #4 - DAY                             50 
Darryl and Lonnie continue along, until... 
OFF SCREEN: A LOUD CRACK. 
Darryl stops, turns.    Lonnie looks at Daryl. 
LONNIE What is it? Hear something? 
Darryl holds his look into the woods, then... 
A SCREAM cries out. 
MIKE Sheryl!? 
Mike moves faster, reaches the end of the hallway, faces the door. He turns the knob, pushes it open, and... 
62   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN BASEMENT                  62 
Mike steps into the room, the light from the hall SPILLS INTO THE ROOM, falls across... 
Sheryl, tied to a beam that extends from the ceiling to the floor, a coarse rope secures a gag in her mouth. She's bruised with a lot of nicks and scratches. 
Sheryl and Mike's eyes lock.     Euphoria, pain all at once. 
MIKE Oh my God. 
Mike runs to her, touches her face.    He checks the ropes tying Sheryl. They're very secure. 
MIKE I need something to cut you down, baby. 
Sheryl tries to motion to the other side of the room. 
Mike follows her gaze... Searching wildly...       scanning the room... a tool bench... tools... TOOLS! 
ON A TOOL BENCH - A litany of the conventional and unconventional. A hammer, screw drivers, axes, a FLASHLIGHT, then, finally... in the middle of bunch... A HUNTER'S KNIFE. 
Mike grabs the knife, hobbles back to Sheryl.      He slides the blade between her cheek and the rope, SLICES.      Several tense moments later... the rope breaks. 
Mike tosses the rope and gag away.    They kiss. 
MIKE Are you okay? 
SHERYL Get me out of here.    Hurry. 
Mike starts cutting the ropes around her wrists. 
SHERYL He'll be back soon. 
MIKE Who's he? 
OFF SCREEN: A LOUD THUD resounds.    Where did it come from? 
Not wanting or waiting to find out, Mike doubles the effort. 
SHERYL Come on, come on, come on... 
SNAP!   Finally, the ropes tear.   Sheryl's free.     Just as... 
ALL THE LIGHTS SIMULTANEOUSLY GO OUT. COMPLETE AND TOTAL DARKNESS SURROUND THE YOUNG COUPLE. Sheryl lets rip a short, but loud SCREAM. Mike quickly silences her. 
BREATHING INTENSIFIES.    Mike and Sheryl take refuge in each other's arms. Then... 
Mike remembers... on the tool bench... THE FLASHLIGHT.      He feels around for the bench, when... WHACK. 
MIKE Fuck! 
He banged his injured leg on something. 
SHERYL (Whispers) What are you doing? 
Mike reaches the tool bench, feels around.    Finds it. 
SHERYL (Whispers) Mike? Mike? 
Mike TURNS ON THE FLASHLIGHT.    The beam CUTS through the darkness and onto... 
The Concealed Figure, stands face to face with Mike brandishing his axe/sickle. 
SHERYL SCREAMS! 
The Concealed Figure swings the axe/sickle, slices Mike across the forearm. BLOOD SPRAYS ACROSS THE FLOOR. 
Mike YELPS in pain, drops the flashlight and knife. 
MIKE Sheryl, run! 
But Sheryl freezes. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006        54. 
He comes at Mike again, but... he eludes the attack. 
Mike grabs the flashlight, the only weapon within his reach, and SWINGS, STRIKING THE CONCEALED FIGURE IN THE KNEE, he drops to the ground. 
The Concealed Figure grabs Mike by the throat, runs him as hard and fast as he can against a wall! 
Sheryl's frozen in fear. 
CLYDE Oh my stars, what happened to you? 
SHERYL (Out of breath) You have to help me. I was kidnapped. My boyfriend came... And this man's chasing me. He's chasing me right now. 
CLYDE Calm down. I can't make heads or tails of what you're saying. 
SHERYL He's coming. He's right behind me. 
Clyde looks up into the woods from where Sheryl came, but... all's peaceful at the moment. No Deacon. 
CLYDE Look, miss, there's no one there. 
SHERYL Oh my God, Mike. 
ANGLE FROM DOWN THE PATH - Clyde, his back to us, consoles Sheryl. Deacon steps into frame. Sickle/Axe in hand. He starts toward Clyde and Sheryl. 
CLYDE It's going to be fine, Miss. I promise you. Everything's going to be fine. 
Sheryl pries her face from Clyde's chest. 
SHERYL'S POV - Deacon's five feet behind Clyde and closing. 
SHERYL SCREAMS.   CLYDE HOLDS ONTO SHERYL. 
Off her look, Clyde turns... DEACON AND CLYDE STAND FACE TO FACE. The moment's frozen. For too long. 
Something's not right. 
CLYDE Deacon, what's going on?    How the heck did she escape? 
Sheryl looks at Clyde, in shock.    Deacon lowers his head, ashamed. 
CLYDE Want something done, gotta do it yourself. 
Clyde removes a black, wooden club from his belt... Sheryl turns, about to run, when... CLYDE CRACKS HER ACROSS THE BACK OF THE HEAD WITH THE CLUB. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
70   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                   70 
SHERYL'S POV - OUT OF FOCUS, WOBBLY. LIGHTS, a rainbow of FUZZY COLORS DANCE BEFORE US. Slowly, bring into focus... Sheryl coughs, gags on something. 
SHERYL'S POV - She lifts her arms to discover her wrists are tied together tightly. 
SHERYL'S POV - Ida enters the room carrying something. Sheryl's breath quickens. Ida walks right up to Sheryl.        She places a FLOWER WREATH in her hair, adjusts it to fit. 
IDA Perfect. Just perfect. You are lovely as a summer's day. (Checks her watch) It's almost time. 
Sheryl catches her REFLECTION in a small wall mirror. 
71   INT.   CHAPEL - DAY                                          71 
ANGLE ON - A ROPE looped through a hook in the ceiling. FOLLOW THE ROPE DOWN... PASS A PAIR OF BLOODY AND BRUISED HANDS, WRISTS... keep going... end on Mike. 
Mike's passed out. He dangles in the middle of the room. He wears an old, moth-eaten sports jacket and slacks. A rope gags his mouth. 
ANGLE ON - the SICKLE/AXE.   As it moves towards Mike... 
Deacon, a black ring surrounds his injured eye, steps in front of Mike, holds the blade CENTIMETERS from Mike's eye. 
An eye for an eye? 
Mike wakes and... immediately freaks out. He tries to shake loose, but can't. Deacon stares at him, but... 
CLYDE (O.S.) Deacon! 
Clyde enters. He wears a long garment around his neck, carries a bible. 
CLYDE That's enough. Get him ready. 
Deacon backs off. He undoes a slipknot on the far wall, which causes Mike to come CRASHING to the floor. Deacon lifts Mike to his feet, positions him. 
It's only now Mike gets a gander at the room. 
The FETUS JARS adorn the far wall. There's a giant WOODEN CROSS hanging over a makeshift altar. CANDLES anywhere and everywhere. 
An old phonograph, one that you CRANK to play, rests in the corner. Clyde places the needle down on a record, CRANKS THE WHEEL. The MUSIC kicks in, CLASSICAL RELIGIOUS... It's hollow, full of static and futz. 
Mike watches... HIS EYES OPEN WIDE, as... 
The iron door slowly CREAKS open. 
ANGLE ON - A FILTHY PAIR OF WHITE DRESS SHOES. Ropes secure the ankles so movement's limited to inches at a time. 
Shimmying into the room, wearing a dusty, old wedding dress and a flower wreath in her hair is Sheryl. Her wrists still bound. Her mouth gagged. 
80   INT.   HALLWAY - CABIN BASEMENT - NIGHT                       80 
Deacon stands by the door.    Ida and Clyde, holding hands, walk towards the stairs... 
IDA It's gotta work this time. 
CLYDE It will. 
IDA Promise me. (Beat; he doesn't...) Promise me, Clyde. 
CLYDE I promise. 
Clyde wraps his arm around Ida's shoulder, comforting her. 
81   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                  81 
Mike makes his way to the table, to Sheryl.    He pulls himself to his feet. 
He takes Sheryl in. She looks peaceful. He runs his good hand through her hair. Tears roll down his cheeks. 
Mike checks each of Sheryl's ropes.    They are all tightly secured. 
Mike haphazardly checks every nook and cranny of the room. But Clyde was right. No way out. 
Mike stares at the phonograph...    HE KICKS IT OFF THE TABLE, KICKS AND BASHES IT TO PIECES. 
VFX: Mike's breathing INTENSIFIES. PUSH INTO TIGHT CLOSE UP... His world is not caving in, it's already caved. 
82   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT TO DAY (SPLINTER UNIT)             82 
TIME LAPSE... The night sky rapidly changes from black to blue. The Sun RISES... 
83   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                  83 
Sheryl's head falls to the side, bumps the table.     She wakes. 
She finds Mike is passed out sitting in a chair, his hand holding hers. 
The door UNBOLTS, FLIES open. 
Mike comes to and glances up as Deacon storms into the room, drags him out screaming. 
84   INT.   HALLWAY - DAY                                          84 
Ida stands just outside the doorway, lets them pass. She slides some surgical gloves on, shuts the door behind her. 
ANGLE ON - SHERYL as the door SHUTS. 
85   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2 - DAY                                    85 
Mike, without his shirt, hangs by his wrists from iron shackles secured to the ceiling. (He's hooked up the same way the Young Man was in the opening scene of the story.) 
Deacon secures the last of the restraints.     Clyde enters, walks straight up to Mike... 
CLYDE Was I at all unclear yesterday? 
MIKE No, but... 
CLYDE Did you understand what was expected of you? 
MIKE Yes, but... How do you expect... 
CLYDE Clearly you did not understand. You did not even attempt relations last evening. 
MIKE What you're asking to do is sick. You're sick. 
CLYDE You didn't have a problem when penetration was a sin, but when it's your wife, it's sick?!? Unbelievable. 
Clyde glares angrily at Mike, then heads to the door. 
CLYDE You knew the rules, Michael. I warned you. Now, Deacon, here, will remind you. 
Mike turns to Deacon, who stands over the tool bench.    DOZENS of sharp instruments of torture lay before him. 
Clyde shuts the door on Mike. 
86   INT.   MAIN ROOM - CABIN - DAY                                  86 
Clyde shuts the door.     Ida waits, helps him with his coat. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT         OCTOBER 17, 2006         70. 
CLYDE I'm going to be late for work. 
IDA Be home at the regular time? 
Clyde removes a set of keys from his pocket... NOTICE THE BOSTON RED SOX KEY CHAIN... They're Mike's keys. 
Ida stares at Sheryl...    debating... 
91   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2                                         91 
Deacon SPLASHES THE ENTIRE JAR OF MOONSHINE ON MIKE'S BACK. A BLOOD-CURDLING SCREAM RINGS OUT. 
92   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1                                         92 
Ida and Sheryl turn in the direction of the SCREAM. This seems to bring Ida back from wherever she was, back to the matter at hand... 
Ida looks into Sheryl's tear-filled eyes. 
IDA You can help...       by following the rules. 
Ida CHOPS off Sheryl's pinky finger. Sheryl SCREAMS. 
ANGLE ON - SHERYL'S PINKY FINGER HITS THE FLOOR. 
93   EXT.   SWAMP - DAY                                             93 
The SUN burns overhead. 
Clyde stands on the banks of a algae covered swamp.     He stares out, nervously watching. 
Brody, in his beat-up Pick-up truck, pulls to a stop.    Exits the truck, approaches Clyde. 
BRODY Clyde! 
CLYDE G'morning, Brody. 
BRODY I stopped by your place the other day. 
CLYDE Ida mentioned. 
BRODY So have you seen or heard anything about that man hiker? 
CLYDE (Beat) In fact I have. I saw him and his lady leave. 
BRODY When was this? 
CLYDE Yesterday.     Just before dusk. 
BRODY Bullshit. 
CLYDE Believe what you want. 
Clyde looks out at the swamp, then back to Brody, who never stopped staring at Clyde. 
BRODY I saw their car last night in the parking lot at base. So they didn't leave, "Just before dusk." 
CLYDE Well, I was down at base this morning... car's gone now. 
BRODY Something don't feel right here, Clyde. Between you and Ida... 
CLYDE I don't have time for this... 
He starts to walk away, but Brody grabs his wrist tightly. 
CLYDE Take your hand off me, Brody. 
BRODY What do you know about that hiker you ain't telling me? 
Brody waits a beat, then lets him go. 
CLYDE I told you, Brody...    I saw them leave. Let it go. 
Brody watches Clyde head off. He's even more paranoid now than before. What Brody doesn't notice... 
ANGLE ON THE SWAMP... Just below the water, sinking, the outline of the back of the Passat. 
94   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT (SPLINTER UNIT)                   94 
DARKNESS envelops the cabin.     A coyote HOWLS. 
95   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - NIGHT                                  95 
Sheryl on table, unconscious.     Her hand/finger bandaged. 
THE DOOR'S THROWN OPEN... Deacon throws Mike roughly to floor. He's tied per usual. 
NOTICE:    the back of Mike's shirt SOAKED in blood. 
MIKE How do you expect me to do this?    Like this? 
CLYDE Do we need to provide you with some more motivation? 
IDA You wouldn't want to put that lovely bride of yours through a day like she had today again, now would you? 
EVELYN Gal's mother's called three times this morning. Said she hasn't heard from her daughter since before she left and she didn't show up for work yesterday or today. 
SAM She sure this was the park they were coming to? 
EVELYN Yup. Woman's already offering up a reward. 
SAM Damn it. Have her fax some photos up here. Notify patrol. 
EVELYN Been a while since we had a couple go missing. Twelve months ago the last? 
Sam crosses to the bulletin board by the door. He studies the flier of the missing couple that Sheryl had noticed. 
SAM (Concerned) Nine. 
98   OMIT (SCENE HAS BEEN MOVED - NOW 95A)                        98 
99   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                 99 
Deacon enters.   Clyde and Ida are with him. 
MIKE You don't have to check...   Nothing happened. 
Clyde and Ida are pissed. 
CLYDE We do appreciate your honesty, Michael. And believe me, we understand your extreme situation, but... Punishment's going to have to be handed down. 
Suddenly, Clyde's walkie-talkie goes off. 
SAM (V.O.) Clyde, it's Sam at base, come back. 
CLYDE Go for, Clyde. 
Mike screams trying to be heard while Clyde has button pushed. 
CLYDE (To Deacon and Ida) Restrain him. 
Deacon holds Mike, while Ida grabs the gag. 
SAM (V.O.) Yeah, morning, Clyde. Got a missing person's report. Young Couple out of Alexandria. We're printing up some flyers with their photos right now. 
MIKE I told you. I told they'd be coming. 
Ida shoves the gag into his mouth, ties it secure. 
SAM (V.O.) When you get a chance, grab some and let's start circulating, huh? 
Clyde throws a concerned look to Ida. 
SAM (V.O.) Clyde? 
CLYDE Copy that. 
Clyde thinks a beat, then... 
CLYDE (To Deacon) Get him in the other room.      Now. 
Concern covers Clyde's face... 
99 A   EXT.   STREAM - DAY                                         99 A 
Brody washes out some mason jars. His shotgun rests against a nearby tree. Lonnie smokes pot from his handmade pipe. 
A walkie-talkie CRACKLES.    Evelyn approaches. 
BRODY Shit.   Get rid of the dope. 
Brody hides the jars in his satchel.      Lonnie quickly tucks his pipe away, fans the smoke away. 
EVELYN Morning, gentlemen. (She eyes her watch) Pardon me... Afternoon. 
LONNIE Evelyn, damn, hurts looking at you. When you gonna give it up to me? 
EVELYN Now with a line like that, it's a shocker I haven't already. 
LONNIE You stone cold tease. 
EVELYN Was wondering if either of you had seen any hikers pass by in the last day or so? 
Lonnie's about to respond, but Brody cuts him off... 
BRODY What's this about? 
Evelyn hands them a flier. 
ON THE FLIER - Photos of Mike and Sheryl, name, info, etc. 
Brody's eyes light up. 
Deacon shifts her skirt exposing more skin and places his hands on Sheryl's bare thighs. She twitches instinctively causing Deacon to squeeze her thighs TIGHTER. 
Sheryl winces in pain, stops her struggle. Locks EYES with Deacon. Suddenly, an aura of CALM falls over her. 
BEHIND SHERYL'S BACK... She resumes untying the knots. 
Deacon savors every moment of Sheryl. Her smell, form. He glides his hands up her body, past her stomach and onto her breasts. He GROPES them, in his own heaven. 
CLOSE ON - The knot loosens... almost there. 
105   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2 - DAY                                   105 
Ida ROTATES the brands in the bar-b-q, doing her best subtle intimidation. 
CLYDE We're not violent people, Michael.    It pains us to pain you. 
MIKE I don't know... Seems as though Deacon and yourselves get a real kick out of it. 
CLYDE Now see, this is what I am talking about. It's your attitude. It's the disobedience, the cussing...Sooner we get what we want, then no further harm has to fall upon you and your wife. 
MIKE Way I see it, you need us alive. You need us, period. And now that Park Services and State Police are looking for us, you're starting to panic, (MORE) 
MIKE (cont'd) knowing your whole plan's crumbling down before your eyes. (To Ida STRONG) So you can stop spinning those fucking irons thinking you're scaring me, cause you're not. (Beat; to both of them) You're a couple of demented, sick, pathetic freaks. 
Ida grabs a brand, JABS IT ONTO MIKE'S CHEST. 
MIKE SCREAMS. THE BRAND BURNS INTO HIS FLESH.     HIS EYES BULGE. HE VOMITS. 
106   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - IDA'S CABIN                          106 
Deacon TEARS open Sheryl's blouse, exposing her bra and more cleavage. He slides his hands over her breasts... he's in heaven. Sheryl doesn't resist because... 
CLOSE ON - The knot's undone.   Her hands are free. 
Deacon looks into Sheryl's eyes.    He senses something different. Does he know? 
Deacon pulls himself closer to Sheryl. Their faces only inches apart. He PULLS her gag out of her mouth, lets it dangle around her neck. Sheryl swallows nervously. Resists the urge to scream. She's frozen. Then... Deacon leans in... KISSES SHERYL. 
Knowing it's now or never, Sheryl KNEES DEACON IN THE BALLS. He falls over in agony. 
Deacon looks up at her, when... SMACK! She KICKS him right in the face. Sheryl springs from the chair, grabs the sickle, turns and... 
CRACK! Deacon, already back on his feet, PUNCHES Sheryl hard across the jaw. She hits the wall, then falls to the floor, drops the sickle. 
ANGLE ON - A SMALL POCKET KNIFE falls off a shelf in the room onto the floor. 
Deacon grabs the sickle, then lifts her up BY HER HAIR and drags her across the room. 
He throws her face/stomach down on the table top, flips her dress up onto her back. He slides the sickle between her ass and underwear and... CUTS HER PANTIES OFF IN ONE QUICK MOTION, SPREADS HER LEGS APART. 
SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006         85. 
Sheryl, still stunned from the punch, only now starts to realize what is happening to her. 
SHERYL (Weak, soft) No. 
She tries to wiggle off table or close her legs, but Deacon's too strong. He grabs the back of her head, SLAMS it against the table, pinning it in place. With the other hand, HE SLIDES OFF HIS PANTS. 
SHERYL (Stronger) No! 
107   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #2 - IDA'S CABIN                        107 
Mike, his chest scarred, bloody, from the fresh wound, dangles helplessly. Vomit splashed down his body. 
Clyde and Ida look to one another... 
CLYDE What was that? 
108   INT.   TORTURE ROOM #1 - DAY                                108 
Deacon slaps his left hand over her mouth, climbs on top of Sheryl using his weight to keep her in place. Deacon positions himself for penetration, when... 
Sheryl SCREAMS, but Deacon's hand muffles the cries. 
With every ounce of strength left inside her, SHERYL BITES DOWN ON DEACON'S HAND. He SCREAMS, falling off of her. 
CLOSE ON DEACON'S HAND - blood oozes, a large piece looks ripped out. 
Sheryl SPITS the small chunk of his hand out of her mouth. 
Deacon grabs the SICKLE/AXE, starts towards Sheryl... 
At the top of her lungs, SHERYL LETS LOOSE A BLOOD CURDLING SCREAM! And... 
Ida bursts in the room... 
IDA Deacon!   Stop right there!

A giant pile of dirt. The dead body of Brody sits inside the makeshift grave. Ida pushes Lonnie's carcass in next. 
Clyde watches Ida, concern in his eyes. 
CLYDE Ida...   you know what we have to do? 
IDA (Already anticipating) No. I can give her an abortion. Get rid of the bastard child, make them conceive one in wedlock. And then we are right as rain. 
CLYDE Abortion?    No. That we won't do. 
IDA It'll work. Ain't no sin to abort a demon. 
CLYDE Ida, writings on the wall here. Michael's right. With a reward on the table, do you think Brody and Lonnie will be the only two coming? Gonna have lots people looking for these two. (Beat) We're gonna have to make it so no one can ever find them. 
IDA No. 
Ida and Clyde.   A sadness covers their faces, especially Ida. 
CLYDE We'll find another couple, Ida. 
IDA No. You promised me, Clyde, this time was the one. 
CLYDE It's too dangerous. We'll find another couple. A better one. 
MIKE, knife in hand, EXPLODES FROM TORTURE ROOM #2, RUNS STRAIGHT FOR IDA, but... 
Ida SWINGS THE SHOVEL, KNOCKS MIKE'S LEGS OUT FROM UNDER HIM. He trips and falls to the floor. 
Ida gets up, STOMPS DOWN ON MIKE'S HAND.   The knife drops. 
FROM THE HALLWAY... Sheryl looks out, watches as... 
BACK IN THE ROOM...   Ida grabs the knife, PLUNGES it deep into Mike's calf. 
IDA In for a penny, in for a pound. I can't save your soul now, Michael. I tried. I gave you a way to cleanse yourself of all your sins and deliver you to heaven... and how do you repay me? 
Ida takes the knife, DAGGERS IT INTO MIKE'S THIGH. 
IDA BY KILLING MY CLYDE?!? 
SHERYL-- 
Spots the shovel on the floor, grabs it... 
IDA There is no soul blacker than yours. And now, by the grace of God, I must deliver you to Satan myself. 
Ida retracts the blade, pulls herself on top of Mike.   Ready to stab again, when... 
SHERYL SLAMS THE SHOVEL OVER IDA'S HEAD. 
ANGLE ON - THE SHOVEL BLADE sprayed with blood. 
Ida falls over.   Sheryl and Mike stare at her lifeless body. 
Sheryl steps over Ida's legs. She takes a big step, clears Ida's upper body...and stumbles. 
Sheryl goes to Mike, wraps his arm around her, lifts him up. But just as his foot touches the ground... A SURGE OF PAIN CRIPPLES HIM. Mike falls back to the ground.

MIKE I can't make it. 
SHERYL I'm not leaving you. 
MIKE (Thinks) Clyde's walkie-talkie. It's probably upstairs. Find it. Call the Ranger base. (Remembers) My gun. See if you can find our stuff. My gun's in my backpack, side pocket. 
SHERYL What good's the gun?        You tossed away the bullets. 
Mike turns away.   Guilt etched on his face. 
MIKE There's another box of ammo. 
SHERYL Mike...!?! 
MIKE Let's get out of this alive first, then you can bitch me out, okay? 
Sheryl concedes.   She goes to the ladder, stops... turns. 
Mike looks at her.   They stare at one another. 
MIKE It's okay, baby.      Go. 
Sheryl turns, ascends the ladder.

Sheryl exits the sewing room, enters... 
129   INT.   CLYDE AND IDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                        129 
Sheryl searches the bedroom for the walkie-talkie. 
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING, illuminates... In the window, Deacon appears. 
Sheryl doesn't see Deacon.       She FINDS the walkie-talkie... 
SHERYL (Pushes button) Hello? Come in, please.      We need help. Is anyone there? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
130   I/E    RANGER BASE STATION - NIGHT                              130 
RAIN beats against the windows, pounds the roof. Evelyn, with poncho, stands outside, just locking the door, when... 
SHERYL (V.O.) Please, someone? Is anyone there that can help? 
SHERYL... Lowers the walkie, waits for an answer. 
EVELYN... stops. She heard something, but not sure exactly what. She re-enters, heads over to the CB. Just as she picks up the CB Mic... 
DEACON, dripping wet, appears in doorway, lunges for Sheryl. 
Mike pushes up against the Iron Door, but it doesn't move. The shelf wall blocks it. 
142   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                    142 
Sheryl races from the cabin.   RAIN POURING DOWN ON HER.     She spies... 
ANGLE ON - Moonshine jar, a lighter.    The ones Ida used earlier.

Mike, with every ounce of strength left, PUSHES at the iron door. It budges, just a little. He PUSHES again and, finally, THE DOOR OPENS! Mike scrambles into the Chapel. 
145   EXT.   IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                                    145 
Deacon exits the cabin, steps off the porch. He peers into the rain and the darkness of the woods surrounding the cabin. No Sheryl anywhere.

SHERYL (O.S.) Hey! 
Deacon turns, looks up... 
ON THE PORCH ROOF... 
Sheryl, a fresh tear in her dress, holds the SILVER LIGHTER in one hand, the moonshine jar in the other. The Moonshine jar has a torn length of her dress sticking out, a homemade Molotov Cocktail. She glares down at Deacon, lights the cocktail... 
SHERYL Burn in hell you sonofabitch! 
She drops it... 
THE COCKTAIL HITS. THE FLAMES CONSUME DEACON, SPREAD QUICKLY OVER HIS ENTIRE BODY. 
Deacon flails wildly, trying to put out the flames, stumbles forward, runs off towards the forest. He trips and falls just as he enters. 
SHERYL... the rain pouring down, stares at... 
ANGLE ON - DEACON'S BURNING CORPSE lays in the thick brush. 
146   OMIT                                                       146

149   INT.   CHAPEL                                              149 
ANGLE ON - A BLOODY HAND grabs a POKER from the fireplace. 
150   INT.   MAIN ROOM - IDA'S CABIN - NIGHT                     150 
Mike looks, across the room... 
IN THE MIRROR'S REFLECTION - IDA, THE BLOODY MESS THAT SHE IS, STEPS FROM THE SHADOWS, AN IRON FIRE POKER in her hands. 
Mike pushes Sheryl to the couch, safely away just as...   IDA STABS MIKE IN THE STOMACH WITH THE POKER. 
SHERYL SCREAMS. SHE RUNS TOWARDS IDA, SICKLE/AXE IN TOW... SHE SWINGS THE BLADE... IT SLICES THROUGH THE AIR, AND... 
SHOOTING SCRIPT           OCTOBER 17, 2006          99. 
ANGLE ON - IDA'S HEAD, SEVERED AT THE NECK, HITS THE FLOOR, ROLLS TO A STOP. 
Sheryl turns away from Ida, runs to Mike's side. 
Mike's a bloody mess, his life slips from him by the second. 
Sheryl TEARS Mike's shirt, BLOOD POURS from his stomach.     She finds the wound, but has nothing to stop the blood. 
SHERYL You did it, baby. You saved me. You said you would and you did. Stay with me, Mike. Stay with me. 
MIKE (Barely audible) Love you. 
SHERYL Well, if you love me... Fight.    Please baby, fight. 
She looks around wildly, spying...   A wardrobe by the kitchen. 
SHERYL I'll be back in a second, Mike. 
Sheryl jumps up, races for the wardrobe.

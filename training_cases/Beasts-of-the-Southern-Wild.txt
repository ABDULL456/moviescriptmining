BEASTS OF THE SOUTHERN WILD

FINAL DRAFT 
Based on the stage play "Juicy and Delicious" by Lucy Alibar EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAWN 
An abandoned looking trailer sits on top of two 15-foot-tall oil drums. Distant thunder trembles through the peeling metal panels. The structure is in such disrepair, that surely no one lives here. 
But then, a light goes on. 
INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - MORNING 
A tiny hand sculpts the mud on top of a crawfish hole placed on the floor. We pan up to reveal a little girl examining a baby chicken that appears to be dead. This is HUSHPUPPY, an unkempt and seemingly uncared for six-year-old with a gaze of unmistakable wisdom. 
Hushpuppy places the chick on the crawfish hole, like a queen on her throne and the chick twitches to life, cheeps twice. Hushpuppy's esoteric science experiment is interrupted by DISTANT THUNDER. Her eyes stand to attention. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY 
An eerie, harsh wind whips hay and dust through over a giant slumbering pot-belly pig. 
Hushpuppy, donned in boys' underpants and a child-sized wife- beater, tip-toes behind the epic creature. She studies it, wonderful, is this the source of the thunder? 
With the utmost delicacy, she lays a hand on the pig's belly. We hear his HUGE BEATING HEART. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - VARIOUS 
A series of glimpses of Hushpuppy's scientific method. She chases geese, chickens, ducks, dogs around the property- a cross between an abandoned farm and salvage yard. 
Hushpuppy grabs a baby chick and puts it to her ear. A TINY HEARTBEAT. She listens with focused wonder and intensity. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) All the time, everywhere, everything's organs be beatin' and squirtin' and talkin' to each other in ways I can't understand. Mosta the time they probably just sayin' "I'm hungry," or "I gotta poop," but sometimes they talkin' in codes. 
Hushpuppy's eyes dart up as a MAN'S VOICE yells- 
MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Get up, get out of here! 
We hear a YOWL as a cat is flung across the room. 
A window made from a gas station sign opens in a Robinson Crusoe style tree house patched together from storm debris and discarded appliances. 
A wild man with severe features, a frazz of unkempt hair, and brawler's scars opens a window made from a metal sign. This is WINDELL EMMETT DOUCET, known to all as WINK (39). 
WINK Get your pants on, man! 
Wink kills a beer and sends it out the hole in the wall into a basketball hoop attached to a fishing net that stretched 15 feet down to the ground. The net is overflowing with beer cans. 
EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DAY 
Hushpuppy obediently climbs a series of increasingly bigger and bigger oil drums that function like a ladder, up to the door of her house. 
They stand on a long and crumbling road surrounded on both sides by water. The rag tag band of revelers charge forward WHOOPING and SHOUTING. 
Hushpuppy kisses her hand and smacks the town sign. "Isle de Charles Doucet" is crossed out and someone has graffitied "The Bathtub." Each party-goer repeats Hushpuppy's kiss and smack in wild, ritualistic fashion. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The Bathtub's got more holidays than the whole rest of the world. 
EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY 
The townspeople charge in a rousing parade. Everyone drags trails of beer cans, boat parts, anything they can tie to themselves that makes a lot of noise. 
They are the hard faces of fishermen and their feisty wives, downtrodden but with a sense of fortitude among them, a community of heart, spirit, passion, and reckless abandon. 
We see none of the separations that we're used to in modern society. There is no evidence of politics, religion, class, race or any other divisive ideology. The Bathtub is a place of true and honest unity. 
Megaphones sticking out a gutted mini-van broadcast the Cajun band playing inside. Fiddle, saw, guitar, and double-bass players struggle to hold onto their instruments and the truck bounces them down a dirt road. 
They drive under a banner reading "Welcome to the Bathtub Storm Season!" 
Wink and Hushpuppy rattle along on a float made from the front end of a pickup truck. Over the front cabin rears a giants sculpture of a horse-head made out of wooden spikes, metal plates, and heavy chains. Carnival-dressed maniacs clamber on top. 
Wink hollers and waves to people. He fires jets of beer into the mouths of the crowd. 
Hushpuppy dances on the back of the float. Though she's the tiniest member of this very adult parade, she's right in the thick of everything. No one is checking I.Ds Here. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Daddy always saying, that up in the dry world, they got none of what we got. 
EXT. LAFOURCHE SQUARE - DAY 
The town dances around the band in a clearing in the woods. Everyone is bouncing to the music, smiling and joking with one another. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They only got holidays once a year. 
Six babies, each with a racing number pinned to their diaper, are placed by their enthusiastic mammas at a starting-line on a track marked by two adjacent crowds of onlookers. Bets are flying between the spectators as if they're about to watch a cock-fight. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) All babies to the race! Come up to the starting line! The baby race is about to begin. 
Hushpuppy dances in the cheering crowd, swigging a bottle of something she probably shouldn't have. 
A STARTING GUN fires, and the babies make a crawl for it. Most of them are paralysed in tears or bewilderment, but one brave soul toddles towards victory. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They got fish stuck in plastic wrappers, they got their babies stuck in carriages, and chickens on sticks and all that kind of stuff. 
Hushpuppy looks up at Wink who is dancing with his best friend WALRUS (60), a slack jawed, white haired, pinked nosed, handsome devil. 
A baby crosses the finish line, ahead of the rest, victorious. The crowd goes wild. 
EXT. MARINA PAUPIER NET - NIGHT 
Wink opens his trawl net and dumps a massive catch into a picking pan. There's food to feed a hundred in the haul. No one is a bit fazed though, this is just your average night fishing in the Bathtub. 
Shrimp, crabs, and small leaping fish struggle over one another for dear life. 
Hushpuppy helps him sort the catch. Winks's hands move with virtuosic ease, separating the crabs from the shrimp. She studies Wink's every move and tries to measure up to her Dad's proficiency. He doesn't demonstrate or explain anything, but we sense there is a system of education in place here. 
Hushpuppy focuses in on a tiny fish, wriggling and sucking it's last breaths of air. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) One day, the storm's gonna blow, the ground's gonna sink, and the water's gonna rise up so high, there ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water. 
She points to a map showing a ragged coastline. On the wrong side of a giant line marked "levee" is an island labeled "The Bathtub." 
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) Ain't gonna be no Bathtub, just a whole bunch of water. Y'all better learn to survive. 
A mysterious COLD WIND fills the air. Hushpuppy stares into a wall poster of an ice cliff reading: THE SOUTH POLE. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Way back in the day, the Aurochs was king of the world. 
EXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF - DAY 
CRASH CUT to the PANORAMA of an ice cliff, but now it's real. 
We CUT CLOSER to overwhelming white light accompanied by intermittent FROZEN CRACKS that build in frequency and volume. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) If it wasn't for giant snowballs, and the iced age. I wouldn't even be Hushpuppy, I would just be breakfast. 
The light dims in intensity to reveal, frozen deep inside the ice wall, barely visible- a fanged, hairy, bloated, stone aged creature, the same as on Miss Bathsheba's leg. This is an Aurochs. 
INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - EVENING 
Hushpuppy climbs a metal ladder made from a railing, up to Wink's shanty in the trees. Windell, her dirty Chihuahua, follows behind. 
HUSHPUPPY Daddy? Feed-up time. Feed-up? 
Hushpuppy bangs on the door of the shacko. 
HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) Daddy? 
Nothing. 
She goes inside. 
The house is empty. 
She checks the Shacko for food. Nothing. 
EXT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - EVENING 
Several hours later, Hushpuppy stands on a metal bin looking into the distance. 
HUSHPUPPY DADDY!? 
Like some sort of animal call, she SHRIEKS. 
INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Hushpuppy draws a picture of Wink on a foldout mattress... 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Kids that got no Mamma, no Daddy and nobody. They got to live in the woods, and eat grass, and steal underpants. 
Hushpuppy lays down next to her drawing of Wink. 
EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING 
Windell, the Chihuahua and the potbelly pig awake to greet the day. 
Hushpuppy peers into the ground floor of the shacko. 
MARIETTA'S VOICE Hushpuppy what you doing there? You being good like I taught you? 
HUSHPUPPY Yes, mamma. 
Hushpuppy turns on the gas. 
Hushpuppy goes through her safety precautions: oven mitts, a helmet, she flips the table and hides behind it. 
She aims the stove lighter: a flame thrower made from a cigarette lighter and a can of spray deodorant. A spray of flames ignites the stove in a FIREBALL. 
CUT TO: 
MOMENTS LATER. Hushpuppy behind the bubbling stove. She ties on an apron and sways to the music. She is dressing like her mom. 
Marietta's Voice sings to her. 
MARIETTA'S VOICE You're good, you make me happy / you're good, you make me happy. 
HUSHPUPPY That's pretty Mamma. 
MARIETTA'S VOICE You're pretty Hushpuppy. 
Hushpuppy stares into the floating islands of cat food frying in fat, which in her POV is a surreal churning vision, like the bubbling lava at the center of the earth. 
She's SHOCKED out of her vision by a YOWLING CAT being flung across the yard. 
WINK (O.S) Get out of my way you fat animal! 
Hushpuppy jumps down from the stove, grabs a bowl of water, and runs to greet Wink, 
EXT. WINK'S COMPOUND - MORNING 
She clambers down the oil drum ladder spilling her water everywhere in her excitement. 
HUSHPUPPY Daddy! Daddy, Daddy! 
Wink doesn't turn to acknowledge her as he trudges across the field toward his Shacko. He's wearing a hospital patient's smock and no shoes, it seems he checked himself out. 
HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) I learned lots of stuff while you gone. If I drink all this here I can burp like a man. 
Hushpuppy gulps down water, all of it. Wink keeps walking. Hushpuppy BURPS like a man, but he doesn't turn around. 
Hushpuppy stops to examine the situation. Something's not right here. 
HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) How come you wearing a dress? 
Hushpuppy tugs his patient's smock and he shrugs her off violently. 
WINK Leave me alone, Man. 
She sees his hospital I.D bracelet still on. 
HUSHPUPPY You wearing a bracelet too? 
WINK Go in your house, you wouldn't understand. 
HUSHPUPPY I wanna come in your house. 
EXT. TRAIL BEHIND WINK'S COMPOUND - DAY 
They run deeper into the swamp. 
HUSHPUPPY I'm tearing off! 
WINK You ain't tearing off nothin', I'll bust your ass! 
HUSHPUPPY I'm tearing off just like my Momma. 
WINK Come on! 
Wink tried to yank her toward home and Hushpuppy refuses. She digs her heels in. 
WINK (CONT'D) See what happens. See what happens to you! 
Hushpuppy hooks her leg around a tree and holds on. 
Wink slaps Hushpuppy and she falls face down. 
He looks away, disgusted with himself. 
WINK (CONT'D) See what you making me do? You're killing me! 
He reaches down and tries to pick her up. 
WINK (CONT'D) Get up and now come on. 
Hushpuppy jumps up on her own. 
HUSHPUPPY I hope you do die! And after you die, I come to your grave and eat birthday cake all by myself! 
Hushpuppy punches Wink in the heart and suddenly EVERYTHING GOES QUIET, as if all the insects in the forest have hushed. 
All at once, we hear-- 
A HUMAN HEART, beating until there is a SONIC BOOM, an earsplitting CRACK of glacial ice. 
Hushpuppy turns toward the sound. When she turns back Wink's face has transformed, wrenches with fear and pain. 
Wink keels over clutching his arm. 
Hushpuppy stares, her breath accelerating. 
Wink's eyes roll back in his head, he begins to seizure. 
ANOTHER GLACIAL CRACK rings out. The SPLITTING builds to a DEAFENING ROAR. She covers her ears. 
EXT. ANTARCTIC ICE SHELF / WOODS - DAY 
Fissures appear like lightning through the massive ice cliff from the opening of the movie. 
Hushpuppy runs from the sound, hands over her ears. We INTERCUT with shots of falling glaciers. The universe is coming unravelled. 
An ice shelf COLLAPSES into the ocean in a MASSIVE AVALANCHE, a wave rolls toward camera. 
EXT. GRAVEYARD BY THE WATER - DAY 
EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY 
STRINGS SWELL under HOWLING WINDS. We follow behind a little boy running down the road with an alarm bell as the people of the Bathtub mobilize in a frenzied evacuation. 
BOY The storm's coming! The storm's coming! 
EXT. LADY JO'S BAR - DAY 
Hushpuppy sulks out of the woods, feeling sorry for herself. She looks up and freezes like she's seen a ghost. 
Wink hobbles down the road, looking shell-shocked. The traffic on the road moves in one direction: out. Wink walks back into town in the opposite direction. 
In Hushpuppy's POV Wink arrives at Lady Jo's bar where a band of drunken sweethearts are in their regular positions. They are watching the evacuation go by like it's a Veteran's Day parade. They giggle and hurl good-natured curses out to a family making their way to safety. 
LITTLE JO Look at these assholes running around all over the damn place. C'est la vie assholes! 
WINK I know y'all with me. Y'all doin' the storm. 
LITTLE JO Lady Jo's ain't never closed honey. 
WINK That's what I'm talking about. Walrus my big man, you staying? 
WALRUS Wrong number buddy. I'm outta here as soon as I finish my beer. 
Wink dismisses him with a wave of his hand. 
WINK You ain't goin nowhere. 
WALRUS This ain't no sneeze comin' out the gulf. I'm gone brother. 
WINK I'll see you tomorrow Walrus. Lookit there, Winston's with me. 
WINSTON is passed out on the stairs. 
WINK (CONT'D) What you doing about the storm Winston? 
Without opening his eyes, Winston raises an umbrella over his head. Wink laughs. 
WALRUS Hey! It's Hushpuppy. 
EVERYBODY Hushpuppy! Hushpuppy's here. 
They burst into a round of drunken applause. 
WINK Hushpuppy? Where you been? 
HUSHPUPPY What happened to y- 
WINK Shut-up! 
He lifts her up by the britches and carries her away. 
WINK (CONT'D) You don't talk! 
INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - GROUND FLOOR - DAY 
Through the bus window, Hushpuppy watches Wink prepare for the storm as branches and debris fly by him. He RANTS to himself and drinks. He ties the Turck onto the house. 
Hushpuppy runs to the window and peeks out. 
OUTSIDE. The frenzy of the hurricane propels Wink at full sprint through the 100 MPH winds. He tears his clothes off and guzzles moonshine as branches fall all around him. 
WINK (CONT'D) Look at me! Look at me Hushpuppy! Watch me kick butt. 
Wink fires his shotgun at the heavens. 
WINK (CONT'D) Hell yea! I'm right here! I'm right here I ain't going nowhere. AHHHHHH!!! 
A THUNDER CLAP shakes the house so hard a ceiling beam CRASHES down. 
Hushpuppy runs to her bed as if it might keep her safe. 
Windell, swinging from a basket tied to the ceiling, BARKS, panicking herself. 
HUSHPUPPY Mamma!? MAMMA!? 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PATAGONIAN COAST - NIGHT 
Still in the rainstorm, a glacial cube SHATTERS, flopping a mammoth body onto the shoreline. 
It's chest heaves and a LOW SNORT is heard. The animal begins to roll over. 
Her dinosaur size hoof plants in the mud as she lifts herself up. We stare over the muscular haunch of her body as she stares into the distance. 
The massive creature turns, testing her limbs after thousands of years of sleep. 
She looks up to the storm and lets loose a GURGLING ROAR. 
We sit close on one of her black eyes. There is something dangerously sad in her cold gaze. Her head moves from the frame as she starts forward on her journey. 
EXT. AERIAL BATHTUB - DAY 
Silence. The storm has passed. 
The camera flies high over the Bathtub. The tops of houses poke out from the massive water like lily-pads in a pond. 
EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - FLOODED - MORNING 
A slab of metal stares at us, surrounded by water. 
Something under the metal BANGS TWICE and an axe dislodges a roof panel. The axe twists and leverages off the slab. 
Wink hefts Hushpuppy on top of the roof. Then Windell. Dishevelled and hung-over, he pulls himself up too. 
The three survivors stare in stunned silence at their new world. 
EXT. FLOODED LAFOURCHE ROAD - TURCK - MORNING 
Wink slowly navigates the Turck in through the flooded landscape where their town had once been. Neither he nor Hushpuppy can say a word. Everything is submerged. Every organism is dead or has fled. The quiet is overwhelming. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) For every animal that didn't have a Dad to put it in a boat, the end of the world already happened. They're all down below, trying to breathe through water. 
They pass abandoned house, after abandoned house, the ones on stilts have water up to the porches. Trees are bashed through roofs, walls are blown through, bathrooms exposed. 
Wink, younger and prettier, naps in an uncharacteristically colorful lawn chair. 
A LOW, GURGLING GROWL wakes him up. 
There in the yard, crawling slow and lazy, is a massive 15- foot alligator, breathing the heavy, slutty way alligators breathe. 
A topless woman steps in front. Sweat beading on her perfect shoulder blades, down her perfect, back ending in a pair of boys' underpants- just like Hushpuppy's. 
Throughout Hushpuppy's vision, we never see Marietta's face, it's always covered, shot from the back, or out of frame. 
Marietta cocks the shotgun with one hand, Terminator 2 style. 
Lowers it on the gator... 
BLAM. Wink sits up in SLOW MOTION- her panties, and her long naked legs are covered with gator blood. 
She turns to Wink, her head ABOVE FRAME. 
CLOSE UP on her eye. She winks. 
INT. FANTASY HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
We follow behind Marietta's supple curves as she walks into the kitchen. Her white slip is almost see through...almost. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Back when Daddy used to talk about Mamma, he'd say she was so pretty she never even had to turn on the stove. 
She runs her fingers along the counter and the burners IGNITE one by one as she passes. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) She just walk into a room and water start to boil. 
Water starts to bubbles like a spontaneous volcanic eruption. 
Marietta reaches into the frigidaire, and pulls out two ice- cold beers. 
Ice melts down the bottles. 
She opens them on the counter, flawlessly. 
She walks over to Wink. Stands there. A hot mess. 
Wink's voice FADES UP. 
WINK (V.O.) Your Momma battered that gator up, and set it to fry. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LADY JO'S BAR - NIGHT 
Wink tips his drink. 
WINK ...and Hushpuppy popped into the universe maybe four minutes later. 
He empties the glass, sufficiently drunk now. 
WINK (CONT'D) I got it under control. 
Wink looks away, lost in his own fantasy. 
LITTLE JO You ain't drinkin' no water. 
Miss Bathsheba pour shots and toasts. 
MISS BATHSHEBA Yea, tastes like more, alright! 
Hushpuppy struggles to peel her shrimps, sitting on top of the table. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) For the ones we'd never find, we make a funeral the Bathtub way, with no crying allowed. 
Drunken Wink is giving drunken Walrus a bath as he eats. 
WALRUS When the water goes down, I'm gonna French kiss the dirt! 
MISS BATHSHEBA Water's not goin' down man. 
WINK Nah, that's my beautiful place under there. 
MISS BATHSHEBA Man you know they got plenty of salt coming into that water, everything beautiful is gone. Trees are gonna dies first, then the animals, then the fish. 
WINK I got it under control. 
Hushpuppy picks up a crab. She tries to pound it open, tries yanking on a leg. She can't shell it. 
JEAN BATTISTE Come on Hushpuppy, come over here lemme show you how. 
Hushpuppy sits down next to Jean, a good pupil. 
JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Here baby. You hold like this, then you turn it over like that. 
Hushpuppy follows instruction in deep concentration, but a bit tentative. 
We see Wink look away from Walrus and Jo's bawdy humor extravaganza and focus in on Hushpuppy. His disdain is palpable for this froufrou shelling technique. 
JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Don't be scared of it now. Now, you take this knife, and you pop this off. 
Jean holds Hushpuppy's hand and guides a knife to open the belly of the crab. 
JEAN BATTISTE (CONT'D) Atta girl. 
WINK NO! Hushpuppy-- 
Wink POUNDS the table. And the party falls suddenly silent. 
Wink pushes the utensil away. He grabs a crab, opens it in three virtuosic hand motions. 
Grease and spice explode everywhere and Wink sucks the face of the crab clean. It is beautiful to watch. 
He slams a fresh crab in front of Hushpuppy. 
WINK (CONT'D) Beast it! 
Hushpuppy looks to Miss Bathsheba for guidance. 
MISS BATHSHEBA You heard your Daddy. Beast it. 
Hushpuppy pulls on the crab shell with all her might. She doesn't have the power. 
Tee-Lou returns and pours water on Lizard's head, cooling her. 
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) This is most important thing I can ever teach y'all. You got to take care of people that's smaller and sweeter than you are. 
Hushpuppy registers this advice, takes it to heart. She rubs Lizard's chest with delicacy and affection. 
Lizard's breathing returns to normal, and she sits up peacefully. Hushpuppy is awestruck. Bathsheba gets to her feet. 
MISS BATHSHEBA (CONT'D) That's better. 
INT. SCHOOLHOUSE - NIGHT 
Hushpuppy watches Wink sleeping. His breathing has gotten worse. 
She tiptoes up with her red basketball jersey and lays it down on Wink, tucking him in just right. 
A DISTANT RUMBLING is heard. Cutting off suddenly as we... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BRAZILIAN FAVELLAS - DAY 
A quiet town, not unlike the Bathtub, but with tangled power- lines, electrical towers, and layered hills. 
A stone flies from behind a house and bounces down the street, denting the silence. 
Slowly, the peaceful morning transitions into MORE RUMBLING, a distant CRACK. 
Suddenly the house in the foreground explodes to smithereens and the head of an Aurochs drives through it. 
Without breaking step, Aurochs maraud the village, trampling it into oblivion. We settle close on an Aurochs eye, emotionless and relentless in its calm. 
EXT. BATHTUB MARSH WATER - TURCK - MORNING 
Wink, Hushpuppy, and the Bathtub crew pole the Turck through a lake blanketed with carcasses, pushing through the dead fish, dead porpoises, dead alligator garfish like they were lily pads. There is no wind, only dense wet heat searing on the faces of the characters. The once green foliage has gone brown and thirsty. 
HUSHPUPPY V.O. Two weeks later, everything started to die. 
WINK (to the water) Come on fishes, where y'at? 
Wink empties his net- nothing but a pile of carcasses. He tips it back into the water. Wink pulls himself to the edge and sticks his head under to look for fish. 
Hushpuppy looks at him with an air of doubt for the first time. Wink looks ridiculous, a dead fish drifts off his head. 
HUSHPUPPY (WHISPERING) You wanna leave the Bathtub, Walrus? 
WALRUS (WITHOUT THOUGHT) Nah. 
Wink pulls his head back up. 
WINK I heard that. 
Hushpuppy fidgets guiltily. 
WINK (CONT'D) Nobody's leaving the Bathtub! You don't know nothing! 
Wink lowers his net back in the water. 
Wink, Jean Battiste, and Peter T keep their heads above water as they float under the tarp behind the truck bed. Peter T is wearing a life jacket and still has his top hat on. 
WINK (WHISPERING) Peter T, don't hold onto me, hold onto the boat. You gonna be fine. 
Jean Battiste duct tapes fireworks around the bomb: a propane tank with an igniter made from a battery and a pouch of black powder. 
He inserts the bomb into the stomach cavity of a giant garfish carcass. 
Wink shoves two propane tanks inside the belly of the garfish. 
He hands a rope attached to the igniter to Peter T. 
WINK (CONT'D) Peter T, you hold the trip-line. 
PETER T (Soft and sweet) Ok then. 
WINK Just don't pull `til I say. 
PETER T Ok then. 
WINK You can do it. I have complete faith in you. 
PETER T Ok. 
Jean Battiste is hesitant. 
Wink gives Jean Battiste a confident nod. 
JEAN BATTISTE Lock and load. 
Jean Battiste carefully unravels the string that leads to the fuse. He shoves the igniter down the mouth of the garfish. 
EXT. LEVEE WALL, IN THE WATER - DAY 
The Turck pulls into an enclosed segment of the levee, Wink bobs out from under the Turck and latches a pre-made tether running out of the garfish to a handle on the wall. He bobs back under the boat. 
EXT. SCHOOLBOAT - DAY 
Hushpuppy dives under the fishing net on a motor boat just before Miss Bathsheba charges outside and keys the ignition. 
Hushpuppy peeks out and the boat roars to life and rips across the water. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) The entire universe depends on everything fitting together just right. If you can fix the broken piece, it can all go right back. 
INT. UNDER THE TURCK TARP/SANTA MARIA - DAY 
WINK Peter T hand me the- 
He looks, Peter T has both hands on the Turck. 
WINK (CONT'D) Peter you didn't drop the trip- line? 
PETER T No I did not. 
Peter T thinks a moment. 
PETER T (CONT'D) Oh, yes I did. 
Water recedes in the Bathtub, revealing the tragic, mud- soaked remnants of their paradise. 
Hushpuppy slogs through the muck, each step going two feet down into the stinking filth. 
The crew trudges behind her in silence. 
EXT. ARK WRECKAGE - DAY 
The blow-up crew crests a hill and sees the remains of the ark sprawled across an open field. 
Wink's and Hushpuppy's eyes well up as they beholds the state of their island. The water has drained. Everything is dead. 
More striking than the ripped-up houses, the land surrounding the island has disappeared. Trees are gone. Shards of marsh that had been attached float in the distance. What was a dense, green landscape is barren. The Bathtub is a scorched hell. 
EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST-FLOOD - EVENING 
Hushpuppy picks through the rubble of the Shacko in the Backo. She finds their grill, and a window made from a dryer door and brings them to Wink. 
The Shacko has crash landed under the stilts of a house that's been entirely washed away. Wink has done some work reassembling the walls and broken parts into a semi- functional enclosure. 
EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST-FLOOD - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Hushpuppy find nails and brings them to Wink, who leans wall panels against the stilts from the previous house. 
He hammers nails wearily. His strength is sapped. He HACKS out bile. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) It didn't matter that the water was gone. Sometimes, you can break something so bad, that it can't get put back together. 
INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - EVENING 
Hushpuppy climbs the stairs of the original house to get to the top of the Shacko. 
She looks down through the hole in the floor. 
In her POV Wink climbs into bed, he painfully takes his shirt off. The bruise on his chest has extended all the way across his stomach. 
Hushpuppy looks out on the water for some sign that Marietta's still with her. The light shining on the water is off. She sees nothing but dead trees and a defunct oil rig. 
HUSHPUPPY Mamma!? 
Nothing. 
HUSHPUPPY (CONT'D) Mamma where you at!? 
As if in response, we hear a HELICOPTER LOUDSPEAKER. 
PILOT This is a mandatory evacuation area, you can no longer live here. Everyone in this area, has to leave. I repeat.... 
EXT. DEAD FOREST - MORNING 
Hushpuppy wades through the muck in what used to be a lush forest, now reduced to toothpick trees and mud. 
She finds her storage unit in the tree hollow, and lifts out the medicine jar. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) When you're small, you gotta fix what you can. 
INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - NIGHT 
Wink's smiles disappears. 
WINK Hey. No crying. Don't you cry man. Don't you cry! 
He threatens her with a shoe. Hushpuppy hides behind an overturned chest. 
WINK (CONT'D) HEY! Don't cry damn it! 
Wink hangs his head and catches his breath against the wall. 
WINK (CONT'D) Shit. 
He pull himself to his feet and grabs a bottle of moonshine. 
He sets up two cups on the table. 
WINK (CONT'D) Come on get a drink. 
Wink pours Hushpuppy a shot. 
Hushpuppy sips. Winces. Looks suspiciously at her father. Sips again. 
Wink takes one straight from the bottle. 
WINK (CONT'D) This counts as I'm sorry for a whole buncha things. Lord. 
HUSHPUPPY You gonna be gone? 
WINK What? No! 
HUSHPUPPY You gonna leave me alone? 
WINK I ain't gon' leave nothing. 
HUSHPUPPY Cause if you be gone, I be gone too. 
WINK Hushpuppy, that is not how it works. 
HUSHPUPPY I will. Sometimes in the bed I start shaking and can't stop. I got what you got. 
WINK No man. That's just a side effect of being a stupid little girl. 
HUSHPUPPY I ain't gonna be dead? 
WINK No. You? No! You gonna live a hundred years more. You know what, show me the guns. 
Hushpuppy shoves Wink. 
WINK (CONT'D) Show me them guns man. 
Wink clears everything off the table with one sweep. 
WINK (CONT'D) Show me the guns! Guns! guns! guns! guns! guns! 
Hushpuppy flexes her biceps. She begins to chant, fierce and TRIUMPHANT-- 
HUSHPUPPY Guns! Guns! Guns! Guns!..... 
The Aurochs move into a desolate, barren, wasteland, looking exhausted and starved. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) Strong animals got no mercy. 
Cold wind blows them backwards. An old Aurochs falls behind the pack. Its legs give out and it lays down. It's not going to make it. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) They the type of animals that eats their own Mommas and Daddies. 
CUT TO: 
The Aurochs cannibalize their fallen comrade, ripping skin and organs in a storm of flesh and gore. 
The CRIES of the screaming mother melt together with another, sound, more MECHANICAL... 
INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - POST FLOOD - MORNING 
The SOUND becomes recognizable as a HELICOPTER PROPELLER. 
Hushpuppy opens her eyes, still tucked in Wink's arm. Through the wall she sees FOUR WELL-DRESSED men. They are out of place like aliens exiting their space ship. 
She rouses Wink, he hears the FOREIGN SOUNDING VOICES and yanks Hushpuppy up. He instinctively pulls him and Hushpuppy behind the over-turned table and grabs a broken chair leg to defend them with. 
EVACUATOR (O.S.) (from outside the door) This is a mandatory evacuation area. Everyone in this region has to leave. 
Wink hurls the chair leg at the intruders as they try to enter. 
WINK We ain't going nowhere! 
Hushpuppy grabs a chair leg as well. It's a standoff. 
INT. LADY JO'S HOUSE - POST FLOOD - MORNING 
Three evacuation workers ram the door of Little Jo's house. 
Little Jo greets the intruders brandishing a cutting knife and civil war era pistol. 
LITTLE JO You gonna have to shoot me cause I'm not going. 
EVACUATOR 2 Ma'am we're not gonna shoot you. 
LITTLE JO I ain't never left here and I won't never will. 
She spits. They get closer. 
LITTLE JO (CONT'D) Son, don't make me cancel your birth certificate. 
The Muscle grabs her by the weapons and in the struggle, slam her to the ground. It's horrible. 
EVACUATOR 2 Relax, relax ma'am. 
LITTLE JO YOU SON OF A BITCH! 
They drag Little Jo out of the house. 
INT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - MORNING 
MATCH CUT to Wink and Hushpuppy pinned and being dragged out. 
WINK No. Hushpuppy... I can't take care of you no more. 
HUSHPUPPY Yes you can. 
Hushpuppy stares him down, accusing. 
WINK Daddy's dying! 
Hushpuppy's chest heaves up and down. 
WINK (CONT'D) My blood is eating itself. You know what that means? 
HUSHPUPPY Don't be sayin' about dying. 
WINK Everybody's Daddy dies. 
HUSHPUPPY Not my Daddy. 
WINK Yes, your Daddy! 
Her defiance is broken and the information starts to sink in. It hurts Wink as much as it hurts her. 
WINK (CONT'D) I didn't want you to watch that, ok? You understand? 
Wink doubles over hacking. He COUGHS horribly. 
Hushpuppy looks down and sees blood spotting the grass, dripping from his mouth. 
The Bathtub gangs charges out the door! 
Across the parking lot they go in a spree of euphoria, coming to a halt around Wink. 
Hushpuppy is trying to drag his limp body across the parking lot. 
HUSHPUPPY Come on! Come on! 
Little Jo hold Hushpuppy away from him. 
WINK Walrus, get me home. 
EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY 
The Bathtub crew carries Wink through the entrance to town. His arms slug over Walrus and Jean Battiste, he's barely able to help walk. 
We sense from the weary faces and silent eyes that it's been a long journey home. 
INT./EXT. SHACKO IN THE BACKO - DAY 
They drag Wink through the Shacko entrance. 
Everyone goes in except Hushpuppy who stops outside the door as they lay him down in convulsions. She stays and tries to watch. 
Wink tries to say something to Walrus and can't. Blood bubbles out of his mouth. Wink catches Hushpuppy's eye then looks away as fast as he can. 
Reeling, but steady, Hushpuppy backs out the door. 
EXT. LAFOURCHE ROAD - DAY 
SERGEANT MAJOR Don't matter baby, this boat'll take you exactly where you need to be. It's just that type of boat. 
Hushpuppy and Sergeant Major share an ease unlike anyone else we've seen Hushpuppy interacted with. The speak like an old teacher with his favorite disciple. They let their silences last. 
SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) You want a chicken biscuit? 
Hushpuppy shakes her head `no'. 
SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) They're good for you. 
A deep, far away melancholy settles over him. He munches on a chicken biscuit, then tosses the wrapper on the floor. The wheelhouse is wall to wall with chicken biscuit wrappers. 
SERGEANT MAJOR (CONT'D) I been eating these all my life. I keep the wrappers in the boat, `cause they remind me who I was when I ate each one. The smell make me feel cohesive. 
HUSHPUPPY I wanna be cohesive. 
SERGEANT MAJOR Oh you will be, I got no doubt in my mind. 
They let this thought settle, then Hushpuppy turns her swivel chair back toward the water 
The beacon appears through the mist. Hushpuppy's eyes go wide. 
As they approach, another boat comes into view. A half- sunken barge that looks as though its been rusting in the same position for a century. As we move in we see a lit up sign: "Elysian Fields Floating Catfish Shack GIRLS GIRLS GIRLS." 
EXT./INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - ENTRANCE - EVENING 
Hushpuppy, Joy, Tee-Lou, and Lizard disembark onto the barge with Sergeant Major following behind. They circle around a hatch in the floor with light pulsing out of it. Far-away JAZZ echoes up from the bowels of the ship. They look to each other in wonder. 
INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 
Hushpuppy descends a ladder into a glimmering wonderland. Christmas lights swallow the ceiling, and a light smoke facade encompasses everything. We feel like we're looking at a portal into the past, a Belloq-esque turned New Orleans Jazz parlor. The regulars are all oil-workers wooing their ladies of the night. 
There is a stage with a DJ and two singers, karaokeing along with "Until the Real Thing Comes Along" by Fats Waller. 
The hyperactive MISS FRANKIE, the matriarch of this establishment, comes a'hoppin'. 
MISS FRANKIE Holy crap you have toddlers! 
SERGEANT MAJOR Good afternoon, Miss Frankie. 
MISS FRANKIE Well butter my butt and call me a biscuit! How you, Sergeant Major? You need some grits? 
SERGEANT MAJOR Yes ma'am. 
MISS FRANKIE Holy Sugar, they are so precious! Y'all just as cute as a tub of puppies! 
Women descend on the kids who recoil, not knowing what to do with all this affection. Joy Strong puts up her fists. 
Hushpuppy pushes through the crowd nonplussed by the flurry of doting ladies. They are not who she is looking for. They are not who she is looking for. 
She scans pictures of strippers through the ages pasted up all over the ceiling, each of them with a bra hung on it, none of them right. 
Bar patrons nod and tip their glasses to her as she passes, ladies smile and return to their drinks, drunk flirtatious dancers giggle at her, but she remains unfazed. 
She reaches two swinging doors that lead to the kitchen. 
Hushpuppy stops. Sniffs. Heaven. 
COOK (CONT'D) (encouraging a smile) Awwwwwwwww. 
A real smile emerges across Hushpuppy's face. 
COOK (CONT'D) Mmm-hmm. 
INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 
Magic soars as the couples rock back and forth on the dance floor. Strippers cradle their dates. It's all very sweet and tender. This seems to be the M.O of this strip club, slow-dance not pole-dance. 
The kids are each dancing with a stripper, glowing with love. They are orphans in a heaven of mothers. 
We float back to Hushpuppy, the camera dances with her and the Cook. 
The Cook squeezes Hushpuppy and spins her. Each time we catch their face their eyes are wetter and wetter. 
HUSHPUPPY You can take care of me. Me and Daddy. 
After a long beat. 
The Cook shakes her head `no.' 
COOK I don't know nothing bout your Daddy, I can't take care of nobody but myself. 
This sinks into Hushpuppy. 
COOK (CONT'D) You can stay if you want. 
Hushpuppy considers this for a moment, squeezes the Cook. 
HUSHPUPPY This is my favorite thing. 
COOK I know. 
A far-away look has come over her. Her mind is somewhere else. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I can count all the time I've been lifted. 
INT. HUSHPUPPY'S HOUSE - DIMLY LIT ROOM - DAY 
We look up at a face that's slowly coming into focus- it's Wink, younger and healthier. 
HUSHPUPPY (V.O.) I can count all the times I've been lifted on two fingers. 
He is the first sight of the slimy newborn baby girl tucked in his arm. Baby Hushpuppy stares up at him as he carries her. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S) Wink! Bring my baby here! They need to wash her off. 
WINK Naw, that waits. 
Baby Hushpuppy's huge-eyed, warped facial expression ogles Wink. She coos. 
WINK (CONT'D) (TO HUSHPUPPY) Alright fatso, breathe some air. 
They pass through a doorway and sun washes over Baby Hushpuppy. She smiles and smiles at the world. 
INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - DANCEFLOOR - NIGHT

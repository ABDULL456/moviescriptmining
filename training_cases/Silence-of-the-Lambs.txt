THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS 
"THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS"

Based on the novel by

FADE IN: 
INT. GRUBBY HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY (DIMLY LIT) 
A woman's face BACKS INTO SHOT, her head resting against grimy wallpaper. She is tense, sweaty, wide-eyed with concentration. This is CLARICE STARLING, mid-20's, trim, very pretty. She wears Kevlar body armor over a navy windbreaker, khaki pants. Her thick hair is piled under a navy baseball cap. A revolver, clutched in her right hand, hovers by her ear. She raises a speedloader, in her left hand, locks it into her cylinder, twists and reloads. 
CLOSE ON 
A guest room door, with a small, wired pack attached to its knob. Suddenly, wish a sharp CRACK!, the knob explodes, and the door bursts open. 
WITH CLARICE - MOVING SHOT 
as she runs around a corner, through a cloud of smoke. She shoulders aside the shattered door and rushes inside, gun at the ready in both hands... 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
CLARICE'S POV - MOVING - as she first sees, sitting on the edge of a bed - a FEMALE HOSTAGE. Black, late 20's, gagged, hands behind her back. Then, SWIVELLING... she sees a startled MALE SUSPECT, white, mid-20's, standing by a window with a rifle in his hands. He is turning towards her... 
Clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts. 
CLARICE Freeze! FBI! 
CLARICE'S POV - SLOW MOTION 
all natural SOUND suspended - as the Suspect faces her with a strange, pleading expression. The rifle is rising in his hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not pointing. Then another puzzling detail registers... 
THE SUSPECT'S HANDS 
are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use it even if he tried. Suddenly we hear a metallic CLICK, which registers with unnatural amplification, as - Clarice reacts, drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and - 
THE "HOSTAGE" 
pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in SLOW MOTION, raising it in her untied hands. She fires repeatedly, flames leaping from the muzzle; the SOUND is an echoing roar in these close quarters, but - 
Clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is already firing back herself, two quick SHOTS, which send - 
THE "HOSTAGE" 
pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still in a haze of gunsmoke. Clarice rushes to her, clamping one knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case of movement. HOLD for a few beats... then we hear the shrill blast of a WHISTLE from somewhere, off screen, as normal ACTION and SOUND are restored. 
BRIGHAM (O.S.) Okay, people, good exercise... 
Clarice relaxes, lowering her gun. The lights brighten. 
PULLING BACK 
we see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the "hotel room" and its "corridor" built as a training set. JOHN BRIGHAM walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch. Mid-40's, ex- Marine. His T-shirt's lettering says "Firearms Instructor / FBI Academy." 
BRIGHAM Starling's reaction time was excellent. Let's break. Critique in five. 
A class of about forty young FBI trainees, of both sexes, begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting. 
Clarice nods amiably to the "Suspect", then gives her "Hostage" a hand up. It's ARDELIA MAPP, her roommate. Her broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both remove ear plugs. Clarice's voice has just a soft trace of southern accent. 
ARDELIA Damn, Clarice, how'd you make me? 
CLARICE (indicating her gun) Never cock. Just squeeze. 
ARDELIA (grins) I love it when you talk dirty. 
As Brigham joins them, Clarice can't resist a star pupil's little smile of pride. He frowns good-naturedly. 
BRIGHAM What're you laughin' at, Junior G- Man? She got off four rounds to your two. 
He takes out a steel-coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her palm. 
BRIGHAM (continuing) One hundred reps, each hand, every day. Now tidy up, the Section Chief wants to see you. 
He nods a direction, then moves off. Clarice, with her smile finally fading, looks out into the auditorium. 
SPECIAL AGENT JACK CRAWFORD 
sits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her. He is 53, strongly built. He rises impassively, exits through the back door. He carries a think manila envelope under one arm. 
Ardelia who is helping Clarice unbuckle her bullet-proof vest, follows her worried gaze. 
CLARICE What'd I do? 
ARDELIA Stay cool. Just remember to call him "God." 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS, QUANTICO, VIRGINIA - DAY 
CHILTON I'm going to show you why we insist on such precautions... On the afternoon of July 8, 1981, he complained of chest pains and was taken to the dispensary. His mouthpiece and restraints were removed for an EKG. When the nurse bent over him, he did this to her... 
He hands Clarice a small, dog-eared photo. Looking at it, she is stopped in her tracks. This pleases Chilton. 
CHILTON The doctors managed to re-set her jaw, more or less, and save one of her eyes. His pulse never got over eighty-five, even when he ate her tongue. (pauses, he smiles) I keep him in here. 
He turns, pushes a button. A steel door BUZZES slowly open, and BARNEY - a big, impassive orderly - awaits them in an anteroom. On its walls: restraints, mouthpieces, Mace, tranquilizer guns. 
CLARICE (quickly blocking him) Dr. Chilton - if Lecter feels you're his enemy - as you've said - then maybe I'll have more luck by myself. What do you think? 
CHILTON (annoyed) You might have suggested that in my office, and saved me the time. 
CLARICE But then I would've missed the pleasure of your company. 
She holds out the photo. A beat. He grabs it, jaw twitching. 
CHILTON When she's finished, bring her out. 
He turns on his heel, goes. Barney smiles reassuringly. 
BARNEY Hi, I'm Barney. He told you, don't get near the bars? 
CLARICE (shaking his hand) Clarice Starling. Yes, he did. 
BARNEY Okay. Past the others, it's the last cell. Stay to the middle. I put out a chair for you. 
Sensing her tension, he indicates a nearby security monitor. 
BARNEY I'm watching. You'll do fine. 
Clarice nods gratefully. She looks down the long corridor, takes a deep breath, walks into it. He watches her go. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DR. LECTER'S CORRIDOR - DAY 
MOVING SHOT - with Clarice, as her footsteps ECHO. High to her right, surveillance cameras. On her left, cells. Some are padded, with narrow observation slits, others are normal, barred... Shadowy occupants pacing, MUTTERING... Suddenly a dark figure in the next-to-last cell hurtles towards her, his face mashing grotesquely against his bars as he hisses. 
DARK FIGURE I c-can sssmell your cunt! 
Clarice flinches momentarily, but then walks on. 
DR. LECTER'S CELL 
is coming slowly INTO VIEW... Behind its barred front wall is a second barrier of stout nylon net... Sparse, bolted- down furniture, many softcover books and papers. On the walls, extraordinarily detailed, skillful drawings, mostly European cityscapes, in charcoal or crayon. 
Clarice stops, at a polite distance from his bars, clears her throat. 
CLARICE Dr. Lecter... My name is Clarice Starling. May I talk with you? 
Dr. Hannibal Lecter is lounging on his bunk, in white pajamas, reading an Italian Vogue. He turns, considers her... A face so long out of the sun, it seems almost leached - except for the glittering eyes, and the wet red mouth. He rises smoothly, crossing to stand before her; the gracious host. His voice is cultured, soft. 
DR. LECTER Good morning. 
CUTTING BETWEEN THEM 
as Clarice comes a measured distance closer. 
CLARICE Doctor, we have a hard problem in psychological profiling. I want to ask for your help with a questionnaire. 
DR. LECTER "We" being the Behavioral Science Unit, at Quantico. You're one of Jack Crawford's, I expect. 
CLARICE I am, yes. 
DR. LECTER May I see your credentials? 
Clarice is surprised, but fishes her ID card from her bag, holds it up for his inspection. He smiles, soothingly. 
DR. LECTER Closer, please... Clo-ser... 
She complies each time, trying to hide her fear. Dr. Lecter's nostrils lift, as he gently, like an animal, tests the air. Then he smiles, glancing at her card. 
DR. LECTER (continuing) That expires in one week. You're not real FBI, are you? 
CLARICE I'm - still in training at the Academy. 
DR. LECTER Jack Crawford sent a trainee to me? 
CLARICE We're talking about psychology, Doctor, not the Bureau. Can you decide for yourself whether or not I'm qualified? 
DR. LECTER Mmmmm... That's rather slippery of you, Officer Starling. Sit. Please. 
She sits in the folding metal desk-chair. He waits politely till she's settled, then sits down himself, faces her happily. 
DR. LECTER Now then. What did Miggs say to you? (she is puzzled) "Multiple Miggs," in the next cell. He hissed at you. What did he say? 
CLARICE He said - "I can smell your cunt." 
DR. LECTER I see. I myself cannot. You use Evyan skin cream, and sometimes you wear L'Air du Temps, but not today. You brought your best bag, though, didn't you? 
CLARICE (beat) Yes. 
DR. LECTER It's much better than your shoes. 
CLARICE Maybe they'll catch up. 
DR. LECTER I have no doubt of it. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - DAY 
The grim gothic pile of the asylum looms overhead as Clarice rushes out the front doors. She is badly shaken, almost stumbling, as she rubs at her face. She looks around for, and finally, with some relief, spots - 
HER CAR 
an old Pinto, parked nearby. This image begins to BLUR... 
CLOSE ON 
her face, fighting tears, as the CAMERA begins to WHIRL AROUND her, almost dizzily. She is seeing, in her mind's eye - 
IN FLASHBACK 
a screen door banging open, on a wooden porch, and a 10-year old girl - the young Clarice - rushing outside, down the front steps, and running joyfully across her front yard to - 
MOVING ANGLE - THE GIRL'S POV 
a car - late 60's vintage - parked in the dirt road. A MAN, Clarice's father, is just climbing out. He's tall, handsome, and has a marshal's badge pinned on his dark suit. He grins, seeing her, and spreads his arms wide as... 
THE YOUNG CLARICE 
rushes into them, and he sweeps her up in a hug, spinning her around, the CAMERA SPINNING with them, and capturing both their laughing faces, before we abruptly return to - 
THE ADULT CLARICE 
alone in the parking lot, sagging against her car. Her face is buried in her arms, she shoulders shaking. SOUND UPCUT - a steady, rapid series of GUNSHOTS, as we 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI ACADEMY FIRING RANGE - DAY 
Clarice, in a combat stance, and wearing a sound-muffling headset, is squeezing off ROUND after ROUND at 
A MOVING TARGET 
The silhouette of a man, approaching along a track. Her shots, tightly grouped, are all finding the center chest. The target stops, quite close to her, still swaying. 
Clarice stares at it, deftly working her speedloader. Then she puts a final, emphatic shot right through THE FIGURE'S FOREHEAD. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI ACADEMY LIBRARY - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON a microfilm monitor - a grainy newsphoto of Dr. Lecter, scrawling past, with an accompanying story ("New Horrors in Cannibal Trial"), dated 1980. 
Clarice is punching keys on the terminal. Other trainees study at nearby tables. 
She pauses, jotting a note on her pad, as Ardelia comes by, carrying an armful of books. 
ARDELIA Phone call, Clarice. It's God. 
CLARICE Thanks, Ardelia. 
MOVING ANGLE 
as Clarice rises, grabbing her notebook, and follows Ardelia past high metal bookstacks. 
ARDELIA You missed Fourth Amendment law. Unlawful seizure, real juicy stuff. Where were you all afternoon? 
CLARICE Pleading with a crazy man, with come all over my face. 
Ardelia stares at her, figures it's a put-on, laughs. 
ARDELIA Damn. Wish I had time for a social life. 
Clarice grins, as Ardelia indicates a phone receiver resting on the check-out desk, then moves on. Clarice picks it up. 
CLARICE (on phone) Mr. Crawford? 
CUT TO: 
INT. CRAWFORD'S HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT 
Crawford, in a cardigan, sits in a wing chair in the book- lined study of his suburban home. He turns the pages of Clarice's memo as they talk. His tone is sharp. 
CRAWFORD I've read your interim memo on Lecter. You sure you've left nothing out? 
INTERCUTTING 
CLARICE It's all there, sir, practically verbatim. 
CRAWFORD Every word, Starling? Every gesture? 
CLARICE (a bit heatedly) Right down to the kleenex I used. (he is silent) Sir, why? Is something wrong? 
CRAWFORD He mentioned a name, at the very end. "Mofet..." Any followup on her? 
CLARICE I spent all evening on the mainframe. Lecter altered or destroyed most of his patient histories, prior to capture. No record of anyone named Mofet. But "Split City" sounded like it might have have something to do with divorce. I tracked it down in the library's catalogue of national yellow pages. (glancing at her notes) It's a mini-storage facility outside Baltimore, where Lecter had his practice. 
She pauses, expecting some soft of approval for her cleverness. 
CRAWFORD Well? Why aren't you there right now? 
CLARICE Sir, that's a field job. It's outside the scope of my assignment. And I've got a test tomorrow on - 
CLARICE (beat) Good idea. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. STORAGE SHED - DUSK (VERY DARK) 
Clarice squirms, on her back, through the narrow opening. As she squeezes all the way in, she snags one thigh on the metal edge of the door. She curses softly, shining her flashlight on her ripped khakis - there's a small streak of blood. 
MR. YOW (O.S.) Okay, Miss Starling? 
CLARICE Okay, Mr. Yow... 
She shines her light around. In its narrow beam, we see - 
CLARICE'S POV - UPWARD, SHIFTING 
spiderwebs, everywhere... high stacks of cardboard boxes... a few dusty pieces of furniture... the big car, oddly long and tall, covered with a tarp... Suddenly there's a scurrying of loud MUSICAL NOTES. Clarice turns, scared, her beam capturing... an old upright piano. 
MR. YOW (O.S.) You're playing a piano, Miss Starling? 
CLARICE That wasn't me. 
MR. YOW (O.S.) Oh. 
Clarice crawls a bit further. There's hardly room to stand, but she finally manages to wriggle upright, clawing away cobwebs, next to the car. Holding her light under one arm, she takes several FLASH photos of the shed's interior, ending with the car. Then, slinging her camera over the shoulder, she folds back the tarp, resting it on the roof. The resulting clouds of dust make her cough. 
THE CAR 
is an antique beauty, a 1931 Packard. It's very dusty, despite the tarp. Curtains close off the back passenger compartment, but there's a narrow gap in them. More mousy RUSTLINGS. 
CLARICE 
peers in through the gap, aiming her flashlight. 
HER POV - SHIFTING 
as the thin flashlight beam picks out: the broad back seat... as open album of lacy, old-fashioned Valentines... a crumpled lap rug, on the floor... and then a pair of women's shiny, high-heeled pumps... Above these, the hem of a fancy satin evening gown - and a pair of pale, stockinged legs. 
Clarice recoils, alarmed, then steadies herself. 
CLARICE Mr. Yow? Oh Mr. Yow...? It looks like somebody is sitting in this car. 
MR. YOW (O.S.) Oh my! Oh my... Maybe you better come out now, Miss Starling. 
CLARICE Not yet! - just wait for me. (under the breath) Maybe in about two seconds. 
She leans down with her camera, takes a FLASH through the gap, then tries the door handle. Locked. So is the front door. She looks around, aiming her light, and locates a tangle of coat-hangers, sticking out of a carton of bric-a-brac. She pulls out one of these, straightens it quickly, bends the tip into a hook. 
CLOSE ANGLE 
as she jams this tool inside the join at the top of the back passenger window, then fishes around till she can snag the inside door latch, pulling up. A satisfying CLICK. 
Clarice opens the door - it hits stacked boxes, and won't open far - then very cautiously leans inside, aiming her flashlight. 
HER POV - MOVING LIGHT BEAM 
revealing more of the evening gown... a pair of hands, in white, elbow-length gloves - one rests on the lap, the other atop a large, beaded, drawstring evening bag... thick strands of costume pearls over the breasts... and finally the white neck stub of a female mannequin. No face or head. 
CLARICE 
sighs with relief. She takes a couple more FLASHES, then very carefully lifts out the Valentine album, holding it by the corners, and setting it atop the car. Then she eases herself inside, onto the back seat, as the springs SQUEAK loudly. 
ONE GLOVED HAND slides off the lap, brushing Clarice's thigh. 
Clarice starts a bit, then pokes at the gloved arm, hard. She peels back a bit of glove, revealing the white, synthetic elbow. She smiles, shaking her head at her own jumpiness, as she reaches over the mannequin's lap to loosen the evening bag's drawstring. 
A SEVERED HUMAN HEAD stares back at her, as the beaded material slides away. 
Clarice lurches back, gasping loudly, and several long, heart- pounding moments pass before she can make herself look more closely. 
The head bobs gently in a pool of alcohol, in a laboratory specimen jar. It is a man's head, but grotesquely transformed, by the addition of heavy makeup, earrings, and a sodden wig, into a woman's face. Over the years the makeup has smeared badly, and the pupils have gone almost milky white. 
CLARICE 
staring at this terrible thing, is pleased to find herself quickly regaining control. She murmurs to herself. 
CLARICE Well, Toto, we're not in Kansas anymore. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. QUINN'S HOSPITAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAINING) 
A loud clap of THUNDER, as a flash of LIGHTNING illuminates the eerie towers and barred windows of the asylum. 
MOVING ANGLE on Clarice as she climbs from her car, runs through heavy rain towards the main entrance, where a guard admits her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DR. LECTER'S CELL AND CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIM LIGHT) 
On a noiseless TV screen, an evangelist rants, waving his arms. Behind him, a swaying choir in gaudy robes. 
CLARICE (O.S.) It's an anagram, isn't it, Doctor? 
PAN TO Clarice, with her wet hair plastered flat, sitting on the corridor floor to one side of this TV, which has been stationed so that Dr. Lecter cannot avoid seeing it. 
CLARICE Hester Mofet... "The rest of me." Miss The-Rest-of-Me... Meaning, you rented that place. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - THE APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT 
Catherine straightens, with her bag of groceries, shutting her car's back door. She sees, a short distance away - 
A MAN 
standing at the open rear door of a brown panel truck. His right forearm is in a cast and sling; he is struggling, unsuccessfully, to hoist an armchair into the truck. Parked nearby, other cars, RVs, a boat on a trailer. A thin, breast- high fog fills the lot; arc lights make yellow pools. 
Catherine hesitates, then crosses towards the man. 
CATHERINE Help you with that? 
MAN Would you? Thanks. 
His voice is odd, strained, very soft. A fog lamp, set on end on the ground, distorts his features from below. We can't get a good glimpse of his face, but his body is plump, above average height; he's in his mid 30's. She sets down the bag, then together they easily lift the chair into the truck. 
MAN (O.S.) Let's slide it up, you mind? 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE PANEL TRUCK - NIGHT 
He climbs inside the truck, ducking under a small hand winch, and grabs the chair. She hesitates again, but climbs in after him; together they slide the chair forward, behind the seats. 
MAN Are you about a size 14? 
CATHERINE (surprised) What? 
Suddenly, in the shadowy dark, he clubs her over the back of her head with his cast. She moans, slumps unconscious, sliding off the armchair to lie on her stomach. He pulls off his cast and sling, tosses them aside, then hops out of the truck, grabs his lamp, climbs back inside, and pulls the door shut. He bends over her face with the lamp. 
We hear her shallow BREATHING. 
MAN Good. 
He peels back the collar of her blouse, reading the size tag. 
MAN Good. 
He carefully slits her blouse up the back, with a pair of bandage scissors, peeling apart the two halves. There's no bra strap. He strokes her bare skin delicately, very happily. 
MAN Gooood... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. THE PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
LOW ANGLE - CLOSE - on Catherine's grocery bag, as her blouse is tossed out beside it. SOUND of the truck's motor starting. The truck backs up, one rear wheel knocking over the bag, partly squashing it. Then is drives away, taillights shrinking, as a lone orange rolls slowly away from the bag... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. FBI ACADEMY CLASSROOM - QUANTICO - DAY 
CLOSE ON a large video screen, where a BLURRY image gradually sharpens, resolving into two separate pieces of fabric. 
INSTRUCTOR (O.S.) Electron microscopy reveals fiber "signatures" that are nearly as distinct as fingerprints... 
Clarice sits at a long table, with other trainees. Ardelia is beside her. Other tables and students in the background. Each trainee has his own microscope. Clarice is tired, but straightens, hearing - 
INSTRUCTOR (O.S.) Both of these blouses were worn by victims of Buffalo Bill. They were found in two different states, and four months apart. He always slits them up the back, like a funeral suit... 
ON THE SCREEN 
successively CLOSER VIEWS of the cut fabric edges, until we are seeing individual threads, big as tree limbs. The cuts match. 
INSTRUCTOR (O.S.) The bunching you see - this compression - is characteristic of scissor cuts, rather than a single blade. And, as you see - Bill always uses the same pair... 
ANGLE ON THE DOOR 
as John Brigham, the gunnery instructor, sticks his head in. 
BRIGHAM Clarice Starling! Are you in here? 
CUT TO: 
INT. HALLWAY - CLASSROOM BUILDING - DAY 
Clarice and Brigham walk briskly down the hall, passing other trainees. He carries a small canvas bag. 
BRIGHAM Get your field gear, take stuff for overnight. You're goin' with Crawford. 
CLARICE Where? 
BRIGHAM Some fishermen in West Virginia found an unidentified girl's body. It's a Buffalo Bill-type situation. Been in the water about a week, and Jack needs somebody that can print a floater. Think you can handle it? 
CLARICE (thinking quickly) I'll need the big fingerprint kit... and the one-to-one Polaroid, the CU- 5, with film packs and batteries. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BRIGHAM'S JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY (DRIVING) 
Brigham steers as they pass hangars, parked planes, an airstrip. Clarice holds a big fingerprint kit and a weekend bag. 
BRIGHAM Jack's pretty tough on you, isn't he? Impatient... 
CLARICE Sometimes. 
BRIGHAM He's got a lot on his mind besides Buffalo Bill... His wife, Bella, is real sick. Comatose... I'm tellin' you about it now, 'cause he may never. 
By now the two cars are entering a tidy little town - tree- lined streets, wooden houses, one-story shops, mountains in the background. They slow, turn. 
CRAWFORD Number Three, I didn't bring you along today just because you can do first-rate forensics. If Lecter is becoming part of this case, you've got the most current read on him. And Number Four - you don't have to like me, or the way I do things. But you do have to keep a cool head. Especially now... Because from here on out, you'll know everything I do. Are we straight on that? 
Clarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's likely to get. She stares out the windshield. 
JUST AHEAD OF THEM 
the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other police cars, facing a big white frame house. Its sign reads "Potter Funeral Home." Two troopers climb from the car. 
Crawford parks too, then kills the engine. He turns to her, removing his sunglasses, gestures to the case file. 
CRAWFORD (softly) You think about him long enough, you get a feel for him... Then, if you're lucky, out of all the stuff you know, one little part of it tugs at you, tries to get your attention... You let me know when that happens, Starling. Live right behind your eyes, today. Don't try to impose any patterns on this guy. Just stay open and let him show you... 
One of the troopers, impassive in his sunglasses and hat, peers in through Crawford's window. Crawford nods to him, then turns back to Clarice. 
CRAWFORD School's out, Starling. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SIDEWALK OF THE FUNERAL HOME - POTTER, WEST VA. - DAY 
SOUND of organ music, as Clarice, carrying her fingerprint kit, mounts some steps to the sidewalk. She stops, seeing - 
COUNTRY PEOPLE 
in their somber best, filing into the mortuary for a service. The music - "Shall We Gather At The River?" - is issuing from the open double doors. Several of the mourners glance over at her curiously. 
ANGLE ON CLARICE 
staring back at the mourners, hearing the music, as a sense memory is triggered in her... 
IN FLASHBACK - LOW ANGLE, MOVING 
as we approach, down the aisle of a country chapel, an open wooden coffin. Sad country faces turn, looking at us from the flanking pews. The b.g. organ hymn is "Shall We Gather...?" 
THE SAD, 10 YEAR-OLD CLARICE 
in her best dress, is reluctantly approaching the casket. Her hands are held by the plump hands of unseen matrons. 
CHILD'S POV 
on the looming coffin... closer and closer... until finally she can see, lying inside it... her dead father, arms folded, his marshal's badge still pinned to his lapel. 
CRAWFORD (V.O.) Starling...? 
NEW ANGLE (PRESENT DAY) 
as the grownup Clarice turns towards the impatient Crawford. Like her, he carries a large case. 
CRAWFORD We're around back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. FUNERAL HOME - BACK CORRIDOR - DAY 
A young deputy, several state troopers, and a SHERIFF are all waiting, as Crawford and Clarice enter. The dim, cluttered corridor doubles as storage space - there's a treadle sewing machine, a soft-drink machine, a tricycle. The MUSIC is closer. Crawford shakes hands with the sheriff. 
CRAWFORD Sheriff Perkins? Jack Crawford, FBI... This is Officer Starling. We appreciate your phoning us. 
SHERIFF (grim, unsociable) I didn't call you. That was somebody from the state attorney's office... 'For you do a thing else, I'm gon' find out if this girl's local. It could just be somethin' that outside elements has dumped on us. 
He casts a sidelong, unhappy glance at Clarice. 
CRAWFORD Well sir, that's where we can help. If - 
SHERIFF I don't even know you, Mister... Now we'll extend you ever courtesy, just soon as we can, but for right now - 
CRAWFORD Sheriff, this, ah - this type of sex crime has some aspects I'd rather discuss just between the two of us. Know what I mean? 
He indicates Clarice with his eyes. The sheriff hesitates, nods, then lets Crawford guide him into a small office, closing the door behind them. Muffled WORDS from there. 
CLARICE 
burning at this slight, is left alone with the troopers, who peek at her with shy curiosity. She pulls her blazer a bit tighter, self-conscious about her bulging shoulder holster. 
ANGLE ON THE OFFICE DOOR 
as, after a few more moments, the sheriff and Crawford emerge. The sheriff, still not very happy, addresses his deputy. 
SHERIFF Oscar, run fetch Dr. Akin from the chapel. And tell Lamar to come on when he's done playin' that music. 
CUT TO: 
INT. EMBALMING ROOM - DAY 
Crawford, in one corner of the room, has set up a Litton Policefax fingerprint transmitter. SOUND of many men's low voices, in background. He is on the phone, and has to speak loudly. 
CRAWFORD I need a six-way linkup! Chicago, Detroit, Cleveland, St. Louis, Atlanta, and Dallas... What?... Can you hear me...? 
He looks around, frustrated by the noisy circus atmosphere. 
CLARICE 
is pulling on a pair of surgical gloves. She raises her voice, turning up her natural accent by several notches. 
CLARICE Gentlemen. You officers and gentlemen! Listen here a minute, please. There's things I need to do for her... 
NEW ANGLE - TWO SHOT 
as Clarice looks at Crawford. 
CLARICE I don't know. I didn't see those on any of the other girls... 
CRAWFORD They weren't there. Get close-ups. 
Clarice raises her camera, leans in for another FLASH. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BACK STEPS OF THE FUNERAL HOME - DAY 
Clarice sits outside, with her head on her knees, drained. She looks up wanly as Lamar appears, offers her a can of Coke. 
CLARICE Thanks, I'm not thirsty. 
LAMAR No, hold it under your chin, there, and on your temples. Cold'll make you feel better. It does me. 
She smiles, touched, and takes the can. When Lamar sees Crawford coming outside, he tactfully departs. Crawford sits beside her; there's a brief silence. She soothes herself with the can. 
CRAWFORD When I told that sheriff we shouldn't talk in front of a woman, that really burned you, didn't it? (she is silent) That was just smoke, Starling, I had to get rid of him. You did well in there. 
CLARICE It matters, Mr. Crawford... Other cops know who you are. They look at you to see how to act... It matters. 
CRAWFORD (beat) Point taken. 
She looks at him a moment, then offers the can. He opens it. 
CRAWFORD When we get back, I want you to run that bug by the Smithsonian, see if they can identify it. Maybe it's got some limited range, or it only breeds at certain times of year... You found it, Starling, you deserve the credit. 
CLARICE I'm wondering if he's done that before - placed a cocoon, or an insect. It would be easy to miss in an autopsy, especially with a floater... Can we check back on that? 
CRAWFORD (shakes his head) The other girls are in the ground. Exhumations are upsetting for the families. I'll do it if I have to, but - 
CLARICE Then have the lab check Raspail's head. (he looks at her) Dr. Lecter's patient - have them probe his soft-palette tissues... They'll find another cocoon. 
CRAWFORD You seem pretty sure of that. 
CLARICE Raspail was killed by the same man who's killing these girls. And Lecter knows him. Maybe even treated him... You think so, too, don't you? Or you'd never have sent me to that asylum. 
He looks at her for a moment, then sips again. 
CRAWFORD Before we caught him, Lecter had a big psychiatric practice in Baltimore. But he traveled all over the country - teaching, consulting... Christ, even testifying in murder trials. Who knows how many potential psychos he turned loose, just for the fun of it...? 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT) 
A shadowy male figure looks down at us, leaning over the edge of a deep hole. He holds a little white poodle in his arms, stroking it. This is MR. GUMB, aka "Buffalo Bill." 
MR. GUMB (softly) Rub the cream on your skin. Rub it in gooood... 
CATHERINE MARTIN 
looks up at him. She is standing on the cement bottom of the pit, or oubliette, about 15 feet below floor level. The pit is bare, except for a futon and a plastic toilet bucket, from which a thin string rises up to the basement. She's soaking wet, in an orange jumpsuit, and holds a squeeze bottle of skin lotion. She struggles to sound calm. 
CATHERINE Mister... my family will pay cash. Whatever ransom you're askin' for, they - 
REVERSE ANGLE - UP TOWARDS MR. GUMB 
MR. GUMB Rub it in! Or you'll get the hose again. 
The little dog squirms in his arms, BARKING excitedly. 
MR. GUMB Yes, it will, Precious, won't it? It will get the hose! 
SIDE ANGLE - AT PIT BOTTOM 
as Catherine kneels, turning slightly away from him. 
CATHERINE (under her breath) Oh God... oh God... 
She unzips her jumpsuit, part-way, then squeezes some of the lotion onto a palm. She reaches inside her suit, rubs it on. 
CATHERINE Mister, if you let me go, I won't press charges, I promise. You've only had me here a couple days, and - 
MR. GUMB (O.S.) No. Just one day... 
CATHERINE Is that all...? See - see, my mom is a real important woman... Well, I guess you already know that. She'll pay you, no questions asked. Whatever cause you represent - Iran, Palestine - she'll see that - 
A sudden blinding glare of light silences her. She looks up, shielding her eyes. 
HER POV 
a floodlamp is descending, attached to a small basket. 
MR. GUMB Put the bottle in the basket. No funny business, or you'll be sorry... 
NEW ANGLE - CATHERINE 
as the basket stops, and she steadies it. But as she slips the bottle in, she sees something, O.S., just at the fringe of the light. She hesitates, looks closer... then begins to scream, hysterically, again and again. Her outflung hand hits the lamp, and in its swaying glare, we see - high on the concrete walls, all around her - 
BLOODY FINGER TRACKS 
dried now, brownish - left by many pairs of frenzied hands... 
RODEN Of course it counts. How do you play? 
PILCHER (grins) Officer Starling. Welcome back. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ENTOMOLOGY CORRIDOR - DAY 
MOVING ANGLE as Clarice and the two men go briskly down a hall lined with mounted insects, in all shapes and sizes. Roden peers at Clarice's new cocoon, in its box. 
RODEN Where the hell did this one come from? It's practically mush. 
CLARICE You really don't want to know. 
PILCHER Your West Virginia specimen gave us quite a bit of trouble, but I finally managed to narrow his species through chaetaxy - studying the skin. 
RODEN I'm the one who found his perforating proboscis! Are you wearing a gun, right now? (Clarice nods) Ooh, cool! Can I see it? Can I? 
PILCHER Just ignore him. He's not a Ph.D. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LABORATORY - DAY 
VERY CLOSE (MAGNIFICATION) on the sliced cocoon, as Roden uses tweezers and a dental probe to ease out the sodden chrysalis. 
RODEN (O.S.) The whole trick is to remove the chrysalis without destroying it... The wings are just like wet tissue paper... 
THE TWO MEN 
are hunched over a formica table, peering through square magnifiers into stainless trays. Clarice watches curiously. Of their two specimens, Pilcher's moth is in much better condition - a big brown creature, its wings outspread on towel paper. 
PILCHER (without looking up) What do you do when you're not detecting, Officer Starling? 
CLARICE I try to be a student, Dr. Pilcher. 
PILCHER Ever get out for cheeseburgers and beer? The amusing house wine...? 
CLARICE (smiles) Not lately. But maybe someday. 
He looks up at her, shyly. A little moment passes between them, before Roden straightens, exultant. 
RODEN Positive match! 
CLARICE You're sure? 
RODEN (points with his dental probe) West Virginia... Baltimore. Officer Starling, meet Mister Acherontia Styx. 
He moves aside for Clarice to get a closer look at Pilcher's specimen. She leans forward, intently. 
HER POV (MAGNIFICATION) 
the wide, furry, brown back of the moth. And there, right between the wing bases - wonderful and terrible to see - is nature's perfect reproduction of a ghostly human skull. 
RODEN (O.S.) Better known to his friends as the Death's-head Moth... 
PILCHER (O.S.) The Latin name comes from two rivers in Hell. Your man - he drops these girls into rivers, every time. Didn't I read that? 
FAVORING CLARICE 
as she looks up at him, awed, excited, almost trembling. 
CLARICE And there's no way - no natural way - these could've wound up in the bodies? 
PILCHER (shakes his head) They live in Malaysia. In this country, they'd have to be specially raised, from imported eggs. 
CLARICE (pause, then softly) Dr. Lecter... 
As the two men stare at her, puzzled, we hear a SOUND UPCUT - the wail of police SIRENS - and... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. U.S. ROUTE 95 - DAY (AERIAL SHOT) 
An awesome armada of police vehicles swings through an intersection, while normal traffic is held back by highway patrol cruisers. 
The lead cars turn off, hit the entrance ramp to the freeway - SIRENS going, tires SQUEALING, red flashers... 
CLOSER ANGLE 
on a speeding surveillance van, with long antennas and a small satellite dish, near the head of the motorcade. 
CRAWFORD (V.O.) Maybe we can trace how he buys the bugs, starting with U.S. Customs... 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY (DRIVING) 
The van is crammed with an impressive array of hi-tech equipment, all CLICKING and HUMMING. Burroughs is talking quietly on a scrambler phone, while another agent works a computer. 
CRAWFORD (O.S.) Maybe we can locate some of Raspail's old lovers. Maybe, someday... 
CLARICE AND CRAWFORD 
sit in swivel seats at the rear, by a big window. Clarice can't resit an occasional peak at the trailing motorcade, awed and a bit thrilled to be the center of so much attention. 
CRAWFORD But for Catherine Martin, it all comes down to you and Lecter. You're the one he talks to. 
CRAWFORD Dr. Danielson, the man we want was never your patient. It would be someone you refused because he tries to conceal a record of criminal violence. Please, Doctor - time is eating us up. Just show me the ones you've turned away. 
Danielson enters a cramped, stainless steel nurse's gallery, with Crawford following, and pours himself a cup of coffee. 
DR. DANIELSON (adamantly) Examination and interview materials are confidential. We've never violated an applicant's trust, and we never will. 
CRAWFORD You want to see a violation? This is a violation... 
He takes a black & white photo from his folder, slaps it down in front of Danielson. From our angle, we can't see it clearly. 
CRAWFORD Her name is Kimberly Jane Emberg, she was just ID'd. I met her on a slab in West Virginia. And sometime tomorrow, or tomorrow night, he's going to do the same thing to Catherine Martin. 
DR. DANIELSON That's a childish, bullying stunt, Mr. Crawford. I was a battlefield surgeon, so you can put away your picture. 
Burroughs sticks his head in, looking for Crawford. 
BURROUGHS Phone, Jack. Director Burke. 
CRAWFORD (snaps) In a minute! 
Burroughs hurriedly retreats. Crawford strains for patience. 
CRAWFORD Look... search your own records, if you prefer. You can do it a lot faster than us, anyway. If we find Buffalo Bill through your information, I'll suppress it. Nobody has to know this hospital cooperated. 
DR. DANIELSON I doubt very much that the FBI or any other government agency can keep a secret, Mr. Crawford. Truth will out... And then what? Will you give Johns Hopkins a new identity? Put a big pair of sunglasses on this building, and a funny nose? 
CRAWFORD Oh, that's clever, Dr. Danielson. Very humorous. You like the truth? Try this. (right in his face, enraged) He kidnaps young women and kills them and rips their skin off. We don't want him to do that anymore. If you don't help me, just as fast as you can, then the Justice Department is going to ask publicly for a court order, We'll ask twice a day, just in time for the morning and evening news. And each one of our press conferences will focus on Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins, and how we're still hoping for his cooperation. And every time there's any news on the case - when Catherine Martin floats, when the next one floats, and the next one - why, we'll just issue another press release about good ol' Dr. Danielson, over at Johns Hopkins - complete with all his humorous fucking remarks. 
DR. DANIELSON (pause; stiffly) It may be that - I could confer with my colleagues on this. And get back to you. 
CRAWFORD Would you, Doctor? That would be so kind. 
CUT TO: 
INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY 
Crawford is on the scrambler phone. Burroughs watches silently. 
CRAWFORD (on phone; stunned) Transferred...? 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI BUILDING - OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR - DAY 
HAYDEN BURKE, the FBI Director, swivels in his big chair. Lean, late 40's, very distinguished. His desk is flanked by flags. 
DIRECTOR BURKE (on phone) Already airborne for Memphis. Senator Martin's meeting him at the airport. (uneasily) Jack - did you make some sort of promise to Lecter, in the Senator's name? 
Listening to the answer, he looks uncomfortably across his desk at PAUL KRENDLER, the Deputy Attorney General - 40, very tanned, modish haircut. Krendler is irritable, impatient. 
DIRECTOR BURKE (on phone) We're going to have to talk about this, Jack. The Senator's mad as hell. Paul Krendler's over here from Justice, she's asking him to take charge in Memphis... I know that... But you're still in command of the task force, and Lecter's plane can still be ordered back. It's your call, Jack - but I want it now. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. THE SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY 
Burroughs starts to make an objection, but Crawford stills him with a hand motion. He is taut, frustrated. Long pause. 
CRAWFORD (into phone) Let him land. 
CUT TO: 
INT.CLARICE'S DORM ROOM - DOORWAY - DAY 
Clarice opens her door, stares out at Crawford. She's just slipping on her blazer, over her shoulder holster. She's furious. 
CLARICE Chilton has killed her, hasn't he? That slimy little bastard! We were so close with Lecter - and now her last chance is gone. 
CRAWFORD Let's get some coffee and talk. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FBI ACADEMY GROUNDS - QUANTICO - DAY 
MOVING ANGLE on Clarice and Crawford, as they walk along a sidewalk, sipping from paper cups. The surveillance van trails them slowly, radios CRACKLING. 
CLARICE Are you in trouble over this, Mr. Crawford? Can Senator Martin do something to you? 
CRAWFORD I'm 53, Starling. If I found Jimmy Hoffa on national TV, I'd still have to retire in two years. It's not a consideration. But you are... (beat) You've done enough. If I keep you out of school any longer, you'll be recycled. Cost you six months, at least. I can guarantee you readmission here, but that's about it. (he stops, looks at her) Now's your chance, Starling. Go back to class. Leave Bill to me. 
CLARICE If you didn't want me chasing him, you shouldn't have taken me to that funeral home. 
He looks at her steadily, then nods. They walk on. 
CLARICE Lecter is still the key, I know he is. Whatever he told me about Bill is just as good now as it was before. 
CRAWFORD Or just as worthless. But I want you in Memphis, close to him. Maybe when he gets tired of toying with Senator Martin, he'll talk to you again. There's a plane waiting for you now at the airstrip. 
She smiles at this acknowledgment; he never thought she's quit. 
CLARICE I lied to Lecter. I'll need some kind of peace offering... Can I get the drawings from his cell? 
CRAWFORD Good idea. Meantime, try to get a feel for Catherine Martin. Her apartment, her friends... how he might've stalked her. I'm going to the other two clinics, Minnesota and Ohio. (he crumples his cup, tosses it) Now's the hardest part, Starling. Use your anger, don't let it keep you from thinking. Just keep your eyes on Catherine. We've got less than 30 hours. 
CLARICE (hesitates) Mr. Crawford... can those cops down there handle Dr. Lecter? 
CRAWFORD (grimly) They'll use their best men. But they better be paying attention... 
CATHERINE Get my legs round your neck, you goddamn creep, I'll send you home to Jesus... 
HER FINGERS 
are tying a chicken bone to the bucket's handle, where it meets the string. The other end of the string is tied to her wrist. 
SHE STANDS 
gathers the coiled string in one hand, and swings the bucket by its handle, calculating this distance up to the basement floor. 
CATHERINE Okay, Precious. Time for a treat... 
She hurls the bucket upwards. 
AT THE LIP OF THE OUBLIETTE 
the bucket sails out, bounces LOUDLY, then falls back inside. 
ANGLE ON THE DOG, PRECIOUS 
who is elsewhere in the basement, worrying a toy. She cocks an ear, making a low GROWL, then sets off to investigate. 
DOWN IN THE PIT 
Catherine swings the bucket again, trying another cast. 
THE BUCKET LANDS 
two feet beyond the pit's edge, rolls a bit, stops. 
PRECIOUS TROTS UP 
then pauses, staring curiously towards... 
VERY LOW ANGLE (DOG'S POV) 
the enticing chicken bone, six feet away. It twitches as Catherine tugs on the string, edging the bucket back towards the pit. 
Precious with her tail wagging, BARKS - greedy but suspicious. 
CATHERINE 
staring upwards, pulls again, even so gently, at the string. 
CATHERINE (softly) Preeeeecious...! C'mon, boy, nice yummy bone... c'mon, you little shit... 
PRECIOUS 
edges reluctantly closer... then suddenly rushes in, seizing the bone in her teeth. She tries to run away with it, but Catherine is pulling her towards the hole, working her like a hooked fish. Her toenails scrabble as she tries to stop. 
CATHERINE 
stares desperately, unable to see how she's doing. 
CATHERINE Hang on, boy... hang on... 
PRECIOUS 
still fights for the bone, GROWLING, as the bucket rocks precariously on the edge of the pit. A long, seesaw battle... until finally, when one of her forelegs slips momentarily into the hole, she panics and lets go. The bucket flops over the edge. 
CATHERINE 
crouches, covering her head as the bucket bounces off her. 
CATHERINE Nooooo...! 
THE LITTLE DOG 
furious, BARKS down at her, then trots away in disgust. 
CLOSE ON CATHERINE 
as she sinks to the cold cement. She slaps aside the foil tray, the scraps of food, sobbing in utter despair... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CATHERINE MARTIN'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON a framed photo of Sen. Martin and Catherine, held in Clarice's cotton-gloved hands. Powdered fingerprints on the glass. 
Clarice glances up from the photo, smiles disarmingly at - 
A young STATE TROOPER sitting in Catherine's easy chair. He smiles back at her, then relaxes, returns to his newspaper. He also wears gloves. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN 
Clarice closes the refrigerator door, glances around. 
A big REEL-TO-REEL TAPE RECORDER has been set up on the breakfast counter, attached to Catherine's phone. Two new red phones are hooked up as well. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM 
Clarice slides open the medicine cabinet's mirror, looks inside. She reaches in, pokes carefully amongst the lotions. 
INT. COURTHOUSE - GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT 
The bronze arrow above the elevator swings towards "5," then indicates a stop there, at the top floor. 
FAVORING SGT. TATE 
at his command desk, as he stares at the indicator. Another cop, JACOBS, sits on the desk's edge, flipping through a magazine; many more cops can be seen beyond them, idling in the lobby. 
SGT. TATE What is this shit...? Did somebody go up to five? (Jacobs shakes his head) Call Pembry, ask him what - 
A GUNSHOT, and then, moments later, TWO MORE quick ones, echo down the nearby stairwell. Sgt. Tate jumps to his feet, grabs a radio mike, as the other cops stir, confused and noisy. 
SGT. TATE (into mike) CP, shots fired on five! Repeat, shots fires on five! Outside posts look sharp, we've got a... Ho-ly shit. 
THE BRONZE ARROW 
has begun to descend. Down to 4, then past 4... 
BACK ON SGT. TATE 
as he reacts. The other cops, behind him, are now in a full uproar, shouting, pulling out guns. 
SGT. TATE (to the others) SHUT UP...! Guard mount, double up on your outside posts. Bobby, get the vests. Rainey, Howard, cover that fucking elevator if it comes all the way to - 
A COP (O.S.) It stopped! 
THE BRONZE ARROW 
has, indeed, frozen at 3. Sgt. Tate lifts the microphone again. 
SGT. TATE (into mike) Seal off a ten-block radius. Get me the SWAT team and an ambulance, double quick. We're going up. 
CUT TO: 
INT. STAIRWELL - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT) 
HIGH ANGLE on Sgt. Tate as he leads a five-man squad, all in bulletproof vests, up the stone stairs. They move fast but carefully, covering each other from landing to landing with drawn revolvers, shotguns. The distant Back MUSIC makes a ghostly echo in here... 
CUT TO: 
INT. THIRD FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT (DIMLY LIT) 
A thin rectangle of light on the floor from the open elevator door. We can't see inside. The MUSIC sounds closer. 
SGT. TATE 
approaches very cautiously, gun aimed. The other cops, behind him, fan out silently to set up angles of fire, checking the various office doors - all locked - as they creep up. 
MOVING ANGLE - OVER TATE'S SHOULDER 
as he reaches the side of the elevator, hesitates, then spins to point his gun inside. It's empty. He backs away. 
SGT. TATE (shouts at ceiling) Pembry? Boyle...? 
CUT TO: 
INT. HISTORICAL SOCIETY ROOM - NIGHT (BRIGHTLY LIT) 
ANGLE on the door, from inside, its lettering reversed on the frosted glass. The Bach is VERY LOUD. 
After a moment the door is shouldered open, hard enough for the glass to shatter, Tate following his gun inside, moving low, then other cops appearing behind him in the doorframe. They all freeze, staring in utter horror. 
SGT. TATE Oh no... no... 
THEIR POV 
is a brief snapshot from hell. The two uniformed bodies, one sprawled on its back near the door, the other still in the cell, have been savaged by a knife. Blood and gore everywhere. The faces are unrecognizable. 
SGT. TATE 
struggles for control, as the other cops move grimly around him, into the room. He pulls his walkie-talkie from his belt. 
SGT. TATE (into mike) Command post... Two offi- (a beat; clears his throat) Two officers down. Prisoner is missing. Repeat, Lecter is missing... He's stripped the bed, might be making a rope, check all windows. Where the fuck is my ambulance? 
IN THE CELL 
a cop angrily punches OFF the music. Jacobs kneels with his fingers on Boyle's neck. 
JACOBS Boyle is dead, Sarge. His gun's gone... 
AT THE OTHER BODY 
a cop gently removes a revolver from the bloody fist. Murray, the young patrolman, brings his ear reluctantly close to the gory face. A bloody bubble appears there; the wreckage GROANS, very softly. 
MURRAY This one's alive! 
Tate crosses, kneels to see for himself. Murray looks green. 
SGT. TATE Take ahold of him where he can feel your hands, son. Talk to him. 
MURRAY What's his name, Sarge? 
SGT. TATE It's Pembry, now talk to him, God dammit. (into radio, looking around) Boyle's dead, Pembry's read bad. Lecter is missing and armed - he took Boyle's gun... 
The other cop, checking the cylinder of Pembry's gun, holds up one finger to Tate. 
SGT. TATE (into radio) Pembry got off one round - there's a chance Lecter was hit. We heard a total of three shots fired, so he's got four left... He's got a knife, too. 
CUT TO: 
INT. GROUND FLOOR LOBBY - NIGHT 
A small army of cops is now covering the elevator doorway, from both sides. Tate crouches next to the SWAT COMMANDER. 
SWAT COMMANDER (into radio mike) We're coming into the car, we're opening the hatch. Watch his hands. Any fire will come from us. Affirm? 
PETERSON'S VOICE Got it. 
The SWAT commander hands his radio to another cop, then looks at Tate. A long, tense moment. Then he waves a signal. 
MOVING ANGLE 
as we follow a picked team of four SWAT cops, in full body armor, rushing into the elevator car. Two men move to the corners, aim assault rifles at the ceiling. A third man sets a stepladder in place, and the fourth man, armed with a big Colt, hurries up the ladder and unclips the hatch. 
CLOSE ON 
...the service hatch, as the hinged cover drops open, and a body tumbles through, dangling head first, until it's caught at the waist. We see the back of the head. 
SGT. TATE 
shoulders through the SWAT cops for a closer look. He turns towards the SWAT commander, astonished. 
SGT. TATE That's Pembry! 
CUT TO: 
INT. EMS AMBULANCE - MOVING 
In the rear chamber, a young EMS ATTENDANT is braced against the vehicle's sway. Behind him, the stretchered form of his patient, and, through a curtained opening, the driver. SOUND of the siren. 
ATTENDANT (into radio mike) He's comatose, but his vital signs are good. Pressure's 130 over 90... Yeah, 90! Pulse 85... 
Behind him, in slightly BLURRED FOCUS, the bloody figure sits slowly upright... 
ATTENDANT His convulsions have stopped, but he's got so much loose skin on his face, it's hard to tell if - 
Suddenly he stops, becoming aware of a strange HISSING. He turns, puzzled... 
THE POCKETKNIFE BLADE 
in Lecter's fist, flashes high in the air... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SIX-LANE FREEWAY - NIGHT (ARC LIGHTS) 
MOVING ANGLE on the EMS ambulance, as it races along normally, its SIREN blazing, the heavy flow of traffic parting to make way for it. 
Then suddenly it begins to weave erratically, changing lanes, before drifting dangerously to a full stop, almost side-ways. Cars swerve to avoid hitting it, HONKING angrily... 
CLOSER ANGLE 
on the stopped ambulance. After a long, still moment, the wind-shield wipes come on, incongruously, then stop. Then the SIREN is shut OFF, and the flashers. The ambulance starts rolling again - at first jerkingly, then with increasing speed. We follow it for several more moments, until is passes - and we LINGER on... 
BIG GREEN INTERSTATE SIGN 
...that reads "Memphis International Airport / 2 miles." 
CLOSE ANGLE - THROUGH AMBULANCE WINDSHIELD 
Dr. Lecter's face is slowly REVEALED, as he wipes across it with a fistful of gauze, tossing it aside... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MONTANA PLAIN - DUSK - (IN FLASHBACK) 
MOVING ANGLE, rushing with dizzy swiftness over the prairie, over waving grasses... a long passage... before we come at last to the girl Clarice, sitting with her lamb, hunched in despair. She rises, her face tear-stained, and turns from us. Holding the lamb, she starts back the way she came... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - NIGHT - BRIGHT MOONLIGHT 
MOVING ANGLE, very rapid, down this road... coming at last to a stopped highway patrol car. Clarice, with her lamb, is standing in the car's headlights. She starts wearily towards the sheriff... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RANCH BARNYARD - NEAR DAWN 
CRANE ANGLE - sweeping rapidly DOWN into the barnyard towards the arriving highway patrol car, as it stops... RUSHING to the little girl as she steps from the car, holding the lamb. 
The dark figure of the rancher ENTERS FRAME. As he roughly takes the lamb from her, we HOLD on a CLOSEUP of her face - stunned, blank. She EXITS FRAME... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BARN - NIGHT 
MOVING ANGLE - CLARICE'S POV as she walks towards the open barn doorway... It looms CLOSER... The rancher is revealed, a shadowy figure, pinning the lamb on the killing table. His knife hand sweeps up high, then holds... He turns TO CAMERA, his face breaking into the light - and it is the face of Dr. Lecter. He smiles his terrible smile at the young Clarice... 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI DORM - PAY PHONE IN HALLWAY - NIGHT 
MOVING ANGLE - coming in very CLOSE on the adult Clarice's face - shocked, devastated - as she stands alone by the dangling receiver... 
CUT TO: 
CRAWFORD Who the hell's fault is - 
KRENDLER - a U.S. Senator who's half out of her head because her daughter's going to be murdered today! And all because of your mind games with fucking Lecter! 
CRAWFORD If you hadn't interfered, he'd still be in custody in Baltimore! 
BURKE Jack - 
KRENDLER You sent in a green recruit, with a phony goddamn offer - 
CRAWFORD You're just trying to cover your ass for letting him escape! 
BURKE THAT'S ENOUGH! All of you... 
A long silence, as they all struggle to regain composure. Crawford, who was at the point of striking Krendler, finally retakes his seat. Burke looks sadly at Crawford and Clarice. 
BURKE (very reluctantly) Starling, I'm afraid I have no choice. You're suspended from the Academy. (Crawford starts to interrupt) Not another word! (to Clarice) This is pending a reevaluation of your fitness for the service. I promise you'll get a fair hearing. (pause) Jack... you're ordered to take compassionate leave. You'll spend the rest of the day briefing the AG's office, then transfer command of the task force, effective by 1800 hours. (beat) I'm sorry, Jack... Go home. Take care of Bella. 
Clarice and Crawford stare back at him, drained. A long and very painful silence. Not even Krendler looks happy. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE FBI BUILDING - DAY 
Clarice and Crawford walk out slowly, stand there a moment, not knowing what to say, not wanting to face each other. 
CLARICE All his victims are women... His obsession is women, he lives to hunt women. But not one women is hunting him - except me. I can walk in a woman's room and know three times as much about her as a man would. (beat) I have to go to Belvedere. 
CRAWFORD You heard them. I don't have that authority anymore. 
CLARICE You do until six p.m. 
He stares at her sadly. He looks, for the first time, defeated, old beyond his years. 
CRAWFORD Ohio is cold ground. Picked over, ten months ago. Our people worked it, so did the locals. 
CLARICE But not from this angle. Not thinking he knew her. You've got to send me! 
CRAWFORD I'm Bureau for 28 years, Starling. I won't disobey orders, not even now. 
CLARICE But I just became a private citizen. I can go anywhere I want to. 
CRAWFORD With ID and a gun...? Impersonating a federal agent is a felony. 
CLARICE He's going to kill her, Mr. Crawford. This morning, or maybe at noon, but today, and Belvedere's our last chance. I'm flying there, right now, unless you stop me. You want my ID? Here - take it... 
He stares at her, a long moment. Catherine's life. Clarice's passion, and future. His loyalty to the Bureau. Call it. 
CRAWFORD (pulls out his wallet) There's about $300 here... And a hotline code number. They'll patch you through to me, wherever I am. 
She raises her hand to him. She wants to touch him face, or his neck, but can't. Finally she takes his money and card. 
CLARICE Thank you. 
He watches, frightened for both of them, as she backs away, smiles, then turns, racing towards the surveillance van. 
SOUND UPCUT - the scratchy recording of Fats Waller SINGING, as we... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT) 
CLOSE ON the needle of the Victrola, on the spinning record, as Mr. Gumb's fingers lift away. MUSIC continues in background. 
MR. GUMB (O.S.) (calling out) Preeeeecious...! 
CLOSE ON the moth cage, as Mr. Gumb's fingers search through the humus, and find a plump new cocoon, lifting it out. The door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult moths flutter out. 
MR. GUMB (O.S.) Precious, come on Precious! Busy busy day today... 
CLOSE ON a clean towel, beside the sink. The cocoon is gently placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives. 
MR. GUMB (O.S.) Momma's gonna be sooo beautiful! 
CLOSE ON a stainless steel Colt Python, with a six-inch barrel, as the cylinder is spun, and the hammer gets a practice cock. The metallic CLICK is deep and loud. A note of alarm has entered Mr. Gumb's voice. 
MR. GUMB (O.S.) You come here this minute, you little scamp! 
LOW ANGLE on Mr. Gumb, wearing the kimono, as he walks through his sewing workroom. His back is to us; he is looking anxiously under the furniture. He stops, straightens. Genuinely scared. 
MR. GUMB Precious...? 
LOW ANGLE - OVER THE PIT OPENING 
Towards Mr. Gumb, as he stops at one of the doorways of the oubliette chamber. He stares inside; his face in shadows. 
MR. GUMB Sweetheart...? 
From the distant bottom of the pit, we hear Catherine's voice. 
CATHERINE (O.S.) She'd down here you sack of shit. 
Mr. Gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the doorframe. A little groan escaped him; the dog answers with a series of YIPS. 
UPWARD ANGLE, FROM THE PIT BOTTOM 
as Mr. Gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge. 
she and the cat stares back at their own reflection... 
CUT TO: 
CLARICE 
sitting at the desk, turns the pages of a high school yearbook. The cat is curled on her lap... 
CUT TO: 
CLARICE 
kneeling by the old Decca record player, flips through LPs and singles. The cat has wandered off... 
CUT TO: 
CLARICE 
pulling a string to light up the closet. She is surprised and intrigued to see an extensive wardrobe, groaning from the rod. A shelf above the rod is stacked high with sewing supplies, in clear plexiboxes. She flips through the hanging clothes, pulls out one dress, on its hanger, for a closer look. 
THE DRESS 
is very big, to fit Fredrica, but beautifully cut. Some of the seams still look unfinished. She turns it around, sees a blue tissue dressmaker's pattern still pinned to the back. 
FAVORING THE SEWING MACHINE 
as Clarice turns, looks towards it. She hangs the dress on the closet door knob, crosses to sit at the machine. She takes off its dust cover. She runs one hand over the cool metal, as a taunting memory forms in her mind. 
DR. LECTER (V.O.) Billy wants to change, too, Clarice. But there's the problem of his size, you see... 
She turns, looks again at the unfinished dress. Suddenly she straightens, her attention riveted by something... 
CLARICE'S POV 
On the printed pattern, down at the lower back of the outlined dress, are two bold black triangles. We RUSH CLOSER to there shapes, before jumping back to - 
CLARICE 
who stares at them, starting to tremble. 
DR. LECTER (V.O.) Even if he were a woman, he'd have to be a big one... 
IN FLASHBACK 
those missing triangles of skin on the dead girl's back, in the funeral home in West Virginia... 
CLOSE ON CLARICE 
as she jumps to her feet, with a fierce joy. 
CLARICE Sewing darts. You bastard. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BIMMEL PARLOR - DOWNSTAIRS - DAY 
Clarice paces, in an exuberant rush, amidst the worn furniture. 
CLARICE (into phone) He's making himself a "woman suit," Mr. Crawford - out of real women! And he can sew, this guy, he's really skilled. A dressmaker, or a tailor - 
CRAWFORD (V.O.) Starling - 
CLARICE That's why they're all so big - because he needs a lot of skin! He keeps them alive to starve them awhile - to loosen their skin, so that - 
CRAWFORD (V.O.) Starling, we know who he is! And where he is. We're on our way now. 
CLARICE (pause; surprised) Where? 
CUT TO: 
INT. FBI TURBOJET - FLYING - DAY 
Crawford sits at a communications console, with Burroughs, in headphones, by his side. This forward section of the cabin is crammed with hi-tech equipment, all lit up and WHIRRING. Through a window we see clouds, part of the jet's wing. 
CRAWFORD (into speaker phone) Calumet City, edge of Chicago. I'll be on the ground in 45 minutes with the Hostage Rescue Team. I'm back in charge, Starling. He's mine. 
INTERCUTTING 
as Clarice reacts; her happiness for Crawford is tinged with disappointment at being so suddenly out of the hunt. 
CLARICE (on phone) Sir, that's great news. But how - 
CRAWFORD Johns Hopkins finally came up with a name for us. We fed him into Known Offenders, and he came up cherries. (takes a paper from Burroughs) Subject's name is "Jamie Gumb," AKA "John Grant." Lecter's description was accurate, he just lied about the name. 
INSIDE THE JET - MOVING ANGLE 
from the rear of the cabin forward, as we slowly PASS the twelve-man HRT. They're seated in full gear, hardshell armor, quietly checking and rechecking their bulging cases of weapons - silencer automatics, shotguns, stun grenades... 
CRAWFORD (O.S.) This Gumb's a real beauty. Slaughtered both his grandparents when he was twelve, and did nine years in juvenile psychiatric. Where, Starling, he took vocational rehab, and learned a useful trade... 
INTERCUTTING 
CLARICE Sewing... 
CRAWFORD Take a bow. Customs had some paper on his alias. They stopped a carton two years ago at LAX - live caterpillars from Surinam. The addressee was "John Grant." Calumet Power & Light's given us two possible residences under that alias. We're hitting one, Chicago SWAT's taking the other. 
CLARICE (eagerly) Chicago's only about 400 miles from here. I could be there in - 
An HRT cop, prone beneath a hedge, is joined by a 2nd HRT Cop, who throws himself to the grass beside him. They both take aim with their scoped rifles at - 
TELEPHOTO ANGLE (WITH RIFLE CROSSHAIRS) 
The front door of a big, nearby, split-level house... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (DIM LIGHT) 
CLOSE ON a fuse box, as Mr. Gumb reaches in, flips a switch. The lights go out. SOUND of a second switch, and the cellar is bathed in a green glow... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET IN CALUMET CITY - NEIGHBOR'S HOUSE - DAY 
A little boy, riding his tricycle in his driveway, is suddenly startled to find himself staring into the grim face of - 
A MEMBER OF THE HRT 
crouched by his garage, armed to the teeth. As the little boy starts to cry, the cop pulls him into the shadows, covering his mouth. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT) 
Mr. Gumb, in his kimono and goggles, creeps silently through his workrooms - knees bent, painted toes places ever so delicately, the Colt held aloft - as more moths flutter past him in the eerie light... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET IN CALUMENT CITY - DAY 
A florist's van turns the corner, comes slowly down the street and stops at the curb in front of the split-level. The driver, in a gray deliveryman's uniform and cap, climbs out of the cab, walks briskly to the panel door, on the street side of the van, and slides it open. He leans in, comes out with a long, thin red-ribboned floral box, starts calmly towards the house... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT) 
MR. GUMB'S POV - MOVING ANGLE on the top of the oubliette, a glowing green circle in the dark, as it draws closer and closer... and then Catherine comes INTO VIEW, at the bottom of the pit. She is crouched, exhausted, staring straight up at him - but she can't see him in this infra-red darkness. Precious is curled into her stomach, asleep. The futon is up to Catherine's waist, but there's a clear shot at her head and neck. 
MR. GUMB 
Looking down at her, smiles... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET IN CALUMET CITY - SUSPECT'S HOUSE - DAY 
MOVING ANGLE on the "deliveryman," seen from behind, as he mounts three steps to the split-level's front porch. Tucked into the small of his back if a 9 mm. automatic. 
CRAWFORD AND BURROUGHS 
have slipped out of the van, and are crouched behind it now, with drawn guns, watching tensely as - 
THE "DELIVERYMAN" 
settles the floral box in the crook of his left arm, reaches out with his right hand towards the buzzer... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY (GREEN LIGHT) 
Slowly, savoring the moment, Mr. Gumb aims the big Colt, which is already cocked, using both hands... He is just about to squeeze the trigger, when we hear his DOOR BUZZER, surprisingly loud and close by. He turns, startled, and sees - 
DUSTY BLACK METAL BOX 
the extension buzzer, mounted high on the wall, which is making the hideous, grating JANGLE. It finally stops, but not before waking Precious, who starts frantically BARKING, off screen, as - 
MR. GUMB 
raises his gun again, spinning back towards - 
HIS POV - THE PIT BOTTOM 
where Catherine, hearing but still not seeing him, quickly yanks the futon over both herself and the dog. Instantly the two of them become one squirming, indistinguishable mass. 
MR. GUMB 
bites his lip, his aim wavering, as he can't decide where to safely place his shot. The maddening BUZZER sounds again, even more insistently, and he cries out with frustration and fury. But as the BUZZER continues, he reluctantly uncocks his gun, looking up angrily towards his front door... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S FRONT DOOR - DAY 
The door opens, on a chain, and Clarice peers in, smiling. 
CLARICE Good afternoon... I wonder if you could help me. I'm looking for Mrs. Lippman's family? 
Mr. Gumb frowns out at Clarice. For the first time ever, we get a well-lit view of his bland, pale-eyed moon of a face. 
MR. GUMB They don't live here anymore. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FRONT DOOR OF SUSPECT'S HOUSE - CALUMET CITY 
The "deliveryman" yanks a 12 lb. sledgehammer from the floral box, swings it with all his might against the door knob, blowing it through as - 
MR. GUMB Do you have his description yet, or some fingerprints...? 
CLARICE 
unaware, is still glancing around the room. For several agonizing moments, we think she won't see the moth - but then she turns, does see it, and her eyes freeze. A beat of pure fear. A tremendous struggle to keep her voice calm. 
CLARICE No... no, we don't. 
Very carefully, she drops her notebook back into her bag, lowers the bag to the floor. With her fingertips she brushes back the edge of her blazer, loosening its drape. 
MR. GUMB 
turns back towards her cheerfully, holding out a business card. 
MR. GUMB Ahhh. Here's that number. 
CLARICE 
keeps her distance. They are about ten feet apart. 
CLARICE Good, thank you. Mr. Gordon, do you have a phone I can use? 
MR. GUMB 
is about to reply when the moth suddenly flies up from behind him, flutters past his face. He turns, looking at it. He looks back at Clarice, his mouth still open. 
HER EYES 
are unmoving, locked on his. 
HIS EYES 
stare back at her, widen. And they know each other. 
MR. GUMB (softly) In the kitchen. I'll show you. 
CLARICE 
whips her gun out, gripping it in both shaking hands. 
CLARICE Freeze! 
MR. GUMB 
slowly tilts his head to one side, smiles at her. 
CLARICE 
tries to force more authority into her voice. 
CLARICE Okay... Okay, Mr. Gumb, you're under arrest. Down on the floor, hands and legs spread, move it. 
MR. GUMB 
turns, then all at once, in two quick steps, he is gone, disappearing into his dining alcove, then kitchen. 
CLARICE 
hesitates, just a split second, to shoot him in the back - and then it's too late. 
CLARICE Shit! 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S KITCHEN - DAY 
Clarice hurries inside, moving low, swivelling her gun. 
HER POV - MOVING 
The kitchen is empty. To one side, a door still shuddering on its hinges... 
CLARICE 
rushes to this - pauses - then elbows the door aside, aiming her gun down - 
AN EMPTY STAIRWELL 
brightly lit, leading to the cellar. Two doors facing the bottom, both open. No sign of Mr. Gumb. 
CLARICE 
hates this, hates this, which door, it's a trap, what to do: she is very scared, but suddenly hears - 
The distant SCREAM of Catherine Martin, somewhere down there in that killing maze. 
CLARICE 
rushes through the doorway, and down the stairs. 
BEHIND HER, ON THE KITCHEN COUNTER there's an empty space; the Colt Python is gone. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S CELLAR - DAY 
MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE - hurrying down the steps. More SCREAMS; they seem to be coming from the left door. Clarice goes that way, entering a brick-walled passage - pipes over- head, naked bulbs. The lighting, though dim, is incandescent; Mr. Gumb has switched off his infra-red system. Clarice comes to a T-shaped intersection, stops. Another SCREAM, again to her left, and the BARKING of a dog... 
centers her gun on the curtain, at chest height, and yanks it aside with her left hand. No one standing there. Something lower down catches her eye. 
She leans in, stares more closely, not understanding, at first, that she's seeing - 
FEMALE HAND AND WRIST 
sticking up from the tub, which is filled with hard red-purple plaster. The hand is dark and shriveled, with pink nail polish and a dainty wristwatch. As - 
CLARICE 
is reacting with horror to this sight, the lights go out, to be replaced, a split-second later, by the eerie green glow of Mr. Gumb's infra-red system. Clarice cries out, turns blindly, reaching for the door, can't find it, free hand clawing desperately into what is, for her, utter darkness. SOUND of Catherine KEENING again, in the far distance. Clarice stumbles, goes to her knees, rights herself, finally clutches the door frame... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MR. GUMB'S WORKROOM - DAY (GREEN LIGHT) 
Clarice emerges from the bathroom in a half-crouch, arms out, both hands on the gun, extended just below the level of her unseeing eyes. She stops, listens. In her raw-nerved darkness, every SOUND is unnaturally magnified - the HUM of the refrigerator... the TRICKLE of water... her own terrified BREATHING, and Catherine's faraway, echoing SOBS... Moths smack against her face and arms. She eases forward, then stops again, listens... She eases forward again, following her gun, and creeps directly in front of, and then past - 
MR. GUMB 
who has flattened himself against a wall, arms spread like a high priest, Colt in one hand. He wears his goggles and kimono, and under that - draping down over his naked arms, like some hideous mantle - his terrifying, half-completed suit of human skins. This is an exquisite moment for him - a ritual of supreme exaltation. He smiles at Clarice as, completely unaware, she moves beyond him, exposing her back. Very slowly and quietly he steps out behind her, taking his gun in both hands, aiming... 
CLOSE ON 
the Colt Python as - in SLOW MOTION - his thumbs cock the hammer, the SOUND registering as a LOUD METALLIC CLICK, and - 
CLARICE 
spins, still in SLOW MOTION, flame already leaping from her gun muzzle, as we see - 
THE TWO FIGURES 
almost at point-black range, guns ROARING hugely, one FLASH from Mr. Gumb, and one two three four FLASHES from Clarice, overlapping his, and then, as the ECHOES crash deafeningly - 
CLOSE ON CLARICE - LOW ANGLE - 
with NORMAL SPEED RESTORED, as the side of her face hits the floor, and she is gasping, stunned by the noise and flames; there is blood on her check, and an ugly powder burn, but she ignores them, twisting to yank her speedloader from her jacket pocket, locking it blindly onto her gun's cylinder, reloading, right in front of her face, then rolling onto her stomach, aiming her gun upward again, blinking her dazzled eyes, straining to locate him in the darkness... Where is he, where...? Then, as the ECHOES finally fade, she hears something else - a tortured, sucking, WHISTLE from perhaps eight feet away... 
MOVING ANGLE - WITH CLARICE 
as she crawls forward, on her elbows, following her gun, until it bumps against Mr. Gumb's shoulder. He is lying on his back, chest a bloody mess. She slides her muzzle against his head, hard, but he doesn't move; another shot isn't needed. He stares upwards, through his goggles, bloody lips working. He tries to speak, but cannot. One hand reaches slowly upwards, the fingers twitching, as if to seize something, overhead... Then a final, ghastly groan, his hand drops, he is dead. Clarice feels for a pulse at his neck, making sure. Then, and only then, does she permit herself to roll over, collapsing onto her back beside him. 
OVERHEAD ANGLE 
down at the two faces - intimately close together, like lovers on their pillow. Then, as we PULL SLOWLY AWAY, we see that her staring eyes, and his dead gaze, are both locked onto - 
A DEATH'S-HEAD MOTH - 
perched on an infra-red bulb, overhead, its wings pumping slowly. 
SOUND UPCUT - wailing SIRENS, many excited VOICES, as we... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MR. GUMB'S HOUSE - DUSK 
The front porch of the tall Victorian house is bathed in a glare of TV lights, police and ambulance flashers. Cars and vans and even a firetruck choke the street; cops, reporters, EMS workers and curious civilians swarm around the ineffective barricades. The BUZZ of their voices goes even higher as 
CLARICE 
dazed, her face bandaged - comes out of the house, walking protectively beside Catherine, who is wheeled on a gurney. 
They are followed out by uniformed cops, then two firemen with an extension ladder. Catherine, blinking in confusion, is still clutching the little dog, and refuses to give her up even as she's trundled into an ambulance. Clarice sways with exhaustion; everyone seems to be shouting at her at once, pulling her sleeve. She tries to fight free of them, desperate for a familiar face. 
AN OHIO HIGHWAY PATROL CAR 
pulls up, stops, and Crawford climbs out of the back seat. He makes his way anxiously through the press of bodies, stopping when he sees Clarice. 
THEY LOOK AT ONE ANOTHER 
for a long moment, Crawford choked with pride for her, with sorrow for her ordeal, with love, but unable to find any words. And then he does. 
CRAWFORD Starling... your father sees you. 
And then all at once she is sobbing, her knees giving way, but he is there to catch her, he is hugging her fiercely. HOLD ON them for a long beat. 
DIRECTOR BURKE (V.O.) (over loudspeaker) Congratulations! You are now officers of the Federal Bureau of Investigation... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GROUNDS OF THE FBI ACADEMY - WEEKS LATER - DAY 
The forty members of Clarice's class, resplendent in their best dark suits and dresses, rise, cheering themselves, then turn happily to wave to their audience, as APPLAUSE mounts. Beyond them, on a gaily tented platform, the Director stands behind his podium. 
CLARICE AND ARDELIA 
look at one another solemnly. Ardelia holds up both fists, in a power shake, and Clarice taps them with her own. She is radiantly beautiful in a navy dress and pearls, the thin scar on her cheek almost healed. Ardelia turns, waving towards the crowd, the Clarice's thoughts are elsewhere. She turns, searching among the dignitaries on the platform, till she locates 
CRAWFORD 
who smiles back at her with quiet pride, and offers a little salute. 
CLARICE 
grins - more happy than we've ever seen her - then turns to wave towards the crowd with the others.

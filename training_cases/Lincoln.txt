Final Shooting Script December 20, 2011 
EXT. BATTLEFIELD, JENKINS' FERRY, ARKANSAS - DAY 
Heavy grey skies hang over a flooded field, the water two feet deep. Cannons and carts, half-submerged and tilted, their wheels trapped in the mud below the surface, are still yoked to dead and dying horses and oxen. 
A terrible battle is taking place; two infantry companies, Negro Union soldiers and white Confederate soldiers, knee- deep in the water, staggering because of the mud beneath, fight each other hand-to-hand, with rifles, bayonets, pistols, knives and fists. There's no discipline or strategy, nothing depersonalized: it's mayhem and each side intensely hates the other. Both have resolved to take no prisoners. 
HAROLD GREEN (V.O.) Some of us was in the Second Kansas Colored. We fought the rebs at Jenkins' Ferry last April, just after they'd killed every Negro soldier they captured at Poison Springs. 
EXT. PARADE GROUNDS ADJACENT TO THE WASHINGTON NAVY YARD, ANACOSTIA RIVER - NIGHT 
Rain and fog. Union Army companies are camped out across the grounds. Preparations are being made for the impending assault on the Confederate port of Wilmington, North Carolina. 
Two black soldiers stand before a bivouacked Negro unit: HAROLD GREEN, an infantryman in his late thirties, and IRA CLARK, a cavalryman in his early twenties. ABRAHAM LINCOLN sits on a bench facing Harold and Ira; his stovepipe hat is at his side. 
HAROLD GREEN So at Jenkins' Ferry, we decided warn't taking no reb prisoners. And we didn't leave a one of `em alive. The ones of us that didn't die that day, we joined up with the 116th U.S. Colored, sir. From Camp Nelson Kentucky. 
LINCOLN What's your name, soldier? 
HAROLD GREEN Private Harold Green, sir. 
IRA CLARK I'm Corporal Ira Clark, sir. Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry. We're waiting over there. 
He nods in the direction of his cavalry. 
IRA CLARK (CONT'D) We're leaving our horses behind, and shipping out with the 24th Infantry for the assault next week on Wilmington. 
LINCOLN (to Harold Green:) How long've you been a soldier? 
HAROLD GREEN Two year, sir. 
LINCOLN Second Kansas Colored Infantry, they fought bravely at Jenkins' Ferry. 
HAROLD GREEN IRA CLARK That's right, sir. They killed a thousand rebel soldiers, sir. They were very brave. (hesitating, then) And making three dollars less each month than white soldiers. 
Harold Green is a little startled at Clark's bluntness. 
HAROLD GREEN Us 2nd Kansas boys, whenever we fight now we - 
IRA CLARK Another three dollars subtracted from our pay for our uniforms. 
HAROLD GREEN That was true, yessir, but that CHANGED - 
IRA CLARK Equal pay now. Still no commissioned Negro officers. 
LINCOLN I am aware of it, Corporal Clark. 
IRA CLARK Yes, sir, that's good you're aware, sir. It's only that - 
HAROLD GREEN (to Lincoln, trying to change the subject:) You think the Wilmington attack is gonna be - 
IRA CLARK Now that white people have accustomed themselves to seeing Negro men with guns, fighting on their behalf, and now that they can tolerate Negro soldiers getting the same pay - in a few years perhaps they can abide the idea of Negro lieutenants and captains. In fifty years, maybe a Negro colonel. In a hundred years - the vote. 
Green's offended at the way Clark is talking to Lincoln. 
LINCOLN What'll you do after the war, Corporal Clark? 
IRA CLARK Work, sir. Perhaps you'll hire me. 
LINCOLN Perhaps I will. 
IRA CLARK But you should know, sir, that I get sick at the smell of bootblack and I can't cut hair. 
THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR IS NOW IN ITS FOURTH YEAR 
EXT. A SHIP AT SEA - NIGHT 
A huge, dark, strange-looking steamship, part wood and part iron, turreted like a giant ironclad monitor, is plowing through the choppy black waters of an open sea. 
Lincoln is alone, in darkness, on the deck, which has no railing, open to the sea. The ship's tearing through rough water, but there's little pitching, wind or spray. The deck is dominated by the immense black gunnery turret. 
LINCOLN (V.O.) It's nighttime. The ship's moved by some terrible power, at a terrific speed. 
Lincoln stares out towards a barely discernible horizon, indicated by a weird, flickering, leaden glow, which appears to recede faster than the fast-approaching ship. 
LINCOLN (V.O.) Though it's imperceptible in the darkness, I have an intuition that we're headed towards a shore. No one else seems to be aboard the vessel. I'm alone. 
INT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 
The room's cozy, attractive, cluttered, part dressmaker's workshop, part repository of Mary's endless purchases: clothing, fabrics, knicknacks, carpets. Books everywhere. 
Lincoln reclines on a French chair, too small for his lengthy frame. He's in shirtsleeves, vest unbuttoned and tie unknotted, shoeless. He has an open folio filled with documents on his lap. 
MARY LINCOLN sits opposite, in a nightgown, housecoat and night cap. She watches him in her vanity mirror. 
She looks frightened. 
TITLE: THE WHITE HOUSE 
LINCOLN I could be bounded in a nutshell and count myself a king of infinite space...were it not that I have bad dreams. I reckon it's the speed that's strange to me. I'm used to going a deliberate pace. 
Mary looks at him, stricken with alarm. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) I should spare you. I shouldn't tell you my dreams. 
MARY I don't want to be spared if you aren't! And you spare me nothing. 
He looks down at the carpet, then back up at her. 
MARY (CONT'D) Perhaps perhaps it's the assault on Wilmington port. You dream about the ship before a battle, usually. 
LINCOLN (rapping lightly on his FOREHEAD:) How's the coconut? 
MARY Beyond description. 
She delicately touches her head. 
MARY (CONT'D) Almost two years, nothing mends. Another casualty of the war. Who wants to listen to a useless woman grouse about her carriage accident? 
LINCOLN I do. 
MARY Stuff! You tell me dreams, that's all, I'm your soothsayer, that's all I am anymore, I'm not to be trusted with - Even if it wasn't a carriage accident, even if it was an attempted assassination - 
LINCOLN It was most probably an - 
MARY It was an assassin. Whose intended target was you. 
LINCOLN How's the plans for the big shindy progressing? 
MARY I don't want to talk about parties! You don't care about parties. 
LINCOLN Not much but they're a necessary - 
Mary studies Lincoln, thinking. Then a revelation: 
MARY I know...I know what it's about. The ship, it isn't Wilmington Port, it's not a military campaign! It's the amendment to abolish slavery! Why else would you force me to 
invite demented radicals into my home? 
Lincoln closes his folio. 
MARY (CONT'D) You're going to try to get the amendment passed in the House of Representatives, before the term ends, before the Inauguration. 
LINCOLN (STANDING:) Don't spend too much money on the flubdubs. 
Mary stands, goes up to him. 
MARY No one's loved as much as you, no one's ever been loved so much, by the people, you might do anything now. Don't, don't waste that power on an amendment bill that's sure of defeat. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) That's my speech. 
He smiles at them. They applaud, some laughing. As Lincoln turns the crank, hoisting the flag, a solo trumpet plays "We Are Coming Father Abra'am" and the audience joins in. Among them, Secretary of State WILLIAM SEWARD, 64, in a thick, exquisite winter coat and hat, and Lincoln's dapper assistant secretary, JOHN HAY, 27. Seward looks pleased. 
AUDIENCE "We are coming, Father Abra'am, three hundred thousand more, From Mississippi's winding stream and from New England's shore..." We leave our plows and workshops, our wives and children dear, With hearts too full for utterance, With but a silent tear. We're coming Father Abra'am..." 
EXT. A CARRIAGE, PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE, WASHINGTON - MORNING 
In a four-door carriage, top down, Seward sits opposite Lincoln. Hay, next to Seward, organizes papers in a portfolio on his lap. 
SEWARD Even if every Republican in the House votes yes - far from guaranteed, since when has our party unanimously supported anything? - but say all our fellow Republicans vote for it. We'd still be twenty votes short. 
LINCOLN Only twenty. 
SEWARD Only twenty! 
LINCOLN We can find twenty votes. 
SEWARD Twenty House Democrats who'll vote to abolish slavery! In my opinion - 
LINCOLN To which I always listen. 
SEWARD Or pretend to. 
LINCOLN With all three of my ears. 
SEWARD We'll win the war soon - It's inevitable, isn't it? 
LINCOLN Ain't won yit. 
SEWARD You'll begin your second term with semi-divine stature. Imagine the possibilities peace will bring! Why tarnish your invaluable luster with a battle in the House? It's a rats' nest in there, the same gang of talentless hicks and hacks that rejected the amendment ten months back. We'll lose. 
Lincoln smiles. 
LINCOLN I like our chances now. 
INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - MORNING 
Lincoln is at his desk, Hay feeding him documents to read and sign. Seward warms himself by the fireplace, holding a brandy. 
SEWARD Consider the obstacles that we'd face. The aforementioned two-thirds majority needed to pass an amendment: we have a Republican 
majority, but barely more than fifty percent - 
LINCOLN Fifty-six. 
SEWARD We need Democratic support. There's none to be had. 
LINCOLN Since the House last voted on the amendment there's been an election. Sixty-four Democrats lost their House seats in November. That's sixty-four Democrats looking for work come March. 
SEWARD LINCOLN I know, but that's - They don't need to worry about re-election, they can vote however it suits `em. 
There's a knock at the office door. 
SEWARD LINCOLN But we can't, um, buy the (to Hay:) vote for the amendment. It's Might as well let `em in. too important. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) I said nothing of buying anything. We need twenty votes was all I said. Start of my second term, plenty of positions to fill. 
Hay opens the door to the outer office, admitting the sound of a sizable crowd. JOHN NICOLAY, 33, Lincoln's rather severe German-born senior secretary, ushers in MR. JOLLY, mid-40s, mud-spattered coat, hat in hands, followed by MRS. JOLLY, similarly road-worn, holding a suitcase. Lincoln stands. 
JOHN NICOLAY Mr. President, may I present Mr. and Mrs. Jolly who've come from Missouri to - 
MR. JOLLY From Jeff City, President. 
Lincoln shakes Mr. Jolly's hand. Mrs. Jolly curtseys. 
LINCOLN Mr. Jolly. Ma'am. This by the fire's Secretary of State Seward. 
Seward nods slightly as he lights a Cuban cigar. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) Jeff City. 
Lincoln looks at the Jollys. They are worried and a little awed. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) I heard tell once of a Jefferson City lawyer who had a parrot that'd wake him each morning crying out, "Today is the day the world shall end, as scripture has foretold." And one day the lawyer shot him for the sake of peace and quiet, I presume, thus fulfilling, for the bird at least, its prophecy! 
Nicolay escorts them out. Before he closes the door: 
LINCOLN Oh, Nicolay? When you have a moment. 
Nicolay nods and steps into the anteroom, where dozens more petitioners are waiting to speak with Lincoln. Hay confers with the doorman. Seward closes the door behind them. 
Lincoln kneels at the fireplace, stoking the fire. He puts more wood in, then stands. Seward watches him, then: 
SEWARD If procuring votes with offers of employment is what you intend, I'll fetch a friend from Albany who can supply the skulking men gifted at this kind of shady work. Spare me the indignity of actually speaking to Democrats. Spare you the exposure and liability. 
There is a sharp knock on the closed door, followed by two long ones. 
LINCOLN Pardon me, that's a distress signal, which I am bound by solemn oath to respond to. 
Lincoln opens the door. Tad enters, cross. 
TAD Tom Pendel took away the glass camera plates of slaves Mr. Gardner sent over because Tom says mama says they're too distressing, but- 
LINCOLN You had nightmares all night, mama's right to - 
TAD But I'll have worse nightmares if you don't let me look at the plates again! 
LINCOLN Perhaps. 
SEWARD We can't afford a single defection from anyone in our party...not even a single Republican absent when they vote. You know who you've got to see. 
Nicolay enters. Lincoln turns to him. 
LINCOLN Send over to Blair House. Ask Preston Blair can I call on him around five o'clock. 
SEWARD (a shudder, a swallow of BRANDY:) God help you. God alone knows what he'll ask you to give him. 
INT. THE LIBRARY, BLAIR HOUSE, WASHINGTON - EVENING 
Lincoln's perched on the edge of an ottoman. 
LINCOLN If the Blairs tell `em to, no Republican will balk at voting for the amendment. 
The room is baronial. PRESTON BLAIR, patriarch of his wealthy and powerful family, 72 years old, sits facing his son, MONTGOMERY BLAIR, 50, whip-thin. A fire blazes in a massive fireplace behind Monty. Preston's handsome, elegant daughter, ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE, 45, sits across from Monty, next to Tad, who's wearing a Union infantryman's uniform, a real musket by his side. 
MONTGOMERY BLAIR No conservative Republican is what you mean - 
PRESTON BLAIR All Republicans ought to be conservative, I founded this party - in my own goddamned home - to be a conservative antislavery party, not a hobbyhorse for goddamned radical abolitionists and - 
ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE Damp down the dyspepsia, daddy, you'll frighten the child. 
MONTGOMERY BLAIR (TO LINCOLN:) You need us to keep the conservative side of the party in the traces while you diddle the radicals and bundle up with Thaddeus Stevens's gang. You need our help. 
LINCOLN Yes, sir, I do. 
MONTGOMERY BLAIR Well, what do we get? 
ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE Whoo! Blunt! Your manners, Monty, must be why Mr. Lincoln pushed you out of his cabinet. 
PRESTON BLAIR MONTGOMERY BLAIR He was pushed out - I wasn't pushed. 
ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D) (SMILING SARCASTICALLY:) Oh of course you weren't. 
PRESTON BLAIR MONTGOMERY BLAIR He was pushed out to placate (to Tad:) the goddamn radical I agreed to resign. abolishonists! 
ELIZABETH BLAIR LEE (CONT'D) (a nod at Tad:) Oh Daddy, please! 
PRESTON BLAIR You don't mind, boy, do you? 
LINCOLN He spends his days with soldiers. 
TAD They taught me a song! 
PRESTON BLAIR Did they? Soldiers know all manner of songs. How's your brother Bob? 
TAD He's at school now, but he's coming to visit in four days! For the shindy! 
PRESTON BLAIR At school! Ain't that fine! Good he's not in the army! 
TAD Oh he wants to be, but mama said he CAN'T - 
STANTON A hundred shells a minute. 
There's a moment of shocked silence. 
STANTON (CONT'D) Till they surrender. 
WILLIAM FESSENDEN Dear God. 
WELLES Yes. Yes. 
LINCOLN Wilmington's their last open seaport. Therefore... 
STANTON Wilmington falls, Richmond falls after. 
SEWARD And the war... is done. 
The rest of the cabinet applauds, foot stomping, table slapping. Only John Usher doesn't join in. 
JOHN USHER Then why, if I may ask are we not concentrating the nation's attention on Wilmington? Why, instead, are we reading in the HERALD - (he smacks a newspaper on THE TABLE) - that the anti-slavery amendment is being precipitated onto the House floor for debate - because your eagerness, in what seems an unwarranted intrusion of the Executive into Legislative prerogatives, is compelling it to it's... to what's likely to be its premature demise? You signed the Emancipation Proclamation, you've done all that can be expected - 
JAMES SPEED The Emancipation Proclamation's merely a war measure. After the war the courts'll make a meal of it. 
JOHN USHER When Edward Bates was Attorney General, he felt confident in it enough to allow you to sign - 
JAMES SPEED (A SHRUG:) Different lawyers, different opinions. It frees slaves as a military exigent, not in any other - 
LINCOLN I don't recall Bates being any too certain about the legality of my Proclamation, just it wasn't downright criminal. Somewhere's in between. Back when I rode the legal circuit in Illinois I defended a woman from Metamora named Melissa Goings, 77 years old, they said she murdered her husband; he was 83. He was choking her; and, uh, she grabbed ahold of a stick of fire- 
wood and fractured his skull, `n he died. In his will he wrote "I expect she has killed me. If I get over it, I will have revenge." 
This gets a laugh. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) No one was keen to see her convicted, he was that kind of husband. I asked the prosecuting attorney if I might have a short conference with my client. And she and I went into a room in the courthouse, but I alone emerged. The window in the room was found to be wide open. It was believed the old lady may have climbed out of it. I told the bailiff right before I left her in the room she asked me where she could get a good drink of water, and I told her Tennessee. Mrs. Goings was seen no more in Metamora. Enough justice had been done; they even forgave the bondsman her bail. 
JOHN USHER I'm afraid I don't - 
LINCOLN I decided that the Constitution gives me war powers, but no one knows just exactly what those powers are. Some say they don't exist. I don't know. I decided I needed them to exist to uphold my oath to protect the Constitution, which I decided meant that I could take the rebels' slaves from `em as property confiscated in war. That might recommend to suspicion that I agree with the rebs that their slaves are property in the first place. Of course I don't, never have, I'm glad to see any man free, and if calling a man property, or war contraband, does the trick... Why I caught at the opportunity. Now here's where it gets truly slippery. I use the law allowing for the seizure of property in a war knowing it applies only to the property of governments and 
citizens of belligerent nations. But the South ain't a nation, that's why I can't negotiate with 'em. So if in fact the Negroes are property according to law, have I the right to take the rebels' property from `em, if I insist they're rebels only, and not citizens of a belligerent country? And slipperier still: I maintain it ain't our actual Southern states in rebellion, but only the rebels living in those states, the laws of which states remain in force. The laws of which states remain in force. That means, that since it's states' laws that determine whether Negroes can be sold as slaves, as property - the Federal government doesn't have a say in that, least not yet - (a glance at Seward, THEN:) - then Negroes in those states are slaves, hence property, hence my war powers allow me to confiscate `em as such. So I confiscated `em. But if I'm a respecter of states' laws, how then can I legally free `em with my Proclamation, as I done, unless I'm cancelling states' laws? I felt the war demanded it; my oath demanded it; I felt right with myself; and I hoped it was legal to do it, I'm hoping still. 
He looks around the table. Everyone's listening. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) Two years ago I proclaimed these people emancipated - "then, thenceforward and forever free." But let's say the courts decide I had no authority to do it. They might well decide that. Say there's no amendment abolishing slavery. Say it's after the war, and I can no longer use my war powers to just ignore the courts' decisions, like I sometimes felt I had to do. Might those people I freed be ordered back into slavery? That's why I'd like to get the Thirteenth Amendment through the House, and on 
its way to ratification by the states, wrap the whole slavery thing up, forever and aye. As soon as I'm able. Now. End of this month. And I'd like you to stand behind me. Like my cabinet's most always done. 
A moment's silence, broken by a sharp laugh from Seward. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) As the preacher said, I could write shorter sermons but once I start I get too lazy to stop. 
JOHN USHER It seems to me, sir, you're describing precisely the sort of dictator the Democrats have been howling about. 
JAMES SPEED Dictators aren't susceptible to law. 
JOHN USHER Neither is he! He just said as much! Ignoring the courts? Twisting meanings? What reins him in from, from... 
LINCOLN Well, the people do that, I suppose. I signed the Emancipation Proclamation a year and half before my second election. I felt I was within my power to do it; however I also felt that I might be wrong about that; I knew the people would tell me. I gave `em a year and half to think about it. And they re- elected me. (BEAT) And come February the first, I intend to sign the Thirteenth Amendment. 
INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - EARLY AFTERNOON 
Nicolay opens the door to the crowded outer office to admit perpetually worried JAMES ASHLEY, 42, (R, OH). Tad eyes him from a chair by the window. 
Lincoln enters the room with Seward. 
LINCOLN Well, Mr. Representative Ashley! Tell us the news from the Hill. 
Lincoln shakes his hand and warmly claps the discombobulated but flattered representative on the shoulder. 
JAMES ASHLEY Well! Ah! News - 
LINCOLN Why for instance is this thus, and what is the reason for this thusness? 
JAMES ASHLEY I... 
SEWARD James, we want you to bring the anti-slavery amendment to the floor for debate - 
ROBERT Well, I don't know if I'm gonna go back to - 
She stops him with an alarmed look. 
MARY We'll fatten you up before you return to Boston. 
ROBERT All right, mama. 
MARY All right. (beaming at him, ADORINGLY:) Oh Robbie... 
INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - MORNING 
Preston Blair, still in his traveling cloak, and Lincoln stand near the fireplace facing one another. 
PRESTON BLAIR Jefferson Davis is sending three delegates: Stephens, Hunter and Campbell: Vice President of the Confederacy, their former Secretary of State, and their Assistant 
Secretary of War. They're coming in earnest to propose peace. 
Both men look into the fire. Preston moves closer. 
PRESTON BLAIR (CONT'D) I know this is unwelcome news for you. Now hear me: I went to Richmond to talk to traitors, to smile at and plead with traitors, because it'll be spring in two months, the roads'll be passable, the Spring slaughter commences. Four bloody Springs now! Think of my Frank, who you've taken to your heart, how you'll blame yourself if the war takes my son as it's taken multitudes of sons. Think of all the boys who'll die if you don't make peace. You must talk with these men! 
LINCOLN I intend to, Preston. And in return, I must ask you - 
PRESTON BLAIR LINCOLN No, this is not horsetrading, - to support our push for this is life and - the amendment when it reaches THE - 
There's a knock on the door. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) Not now! 
Robert enters. Nicolay stands behind him, apologetic. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) Oh. Bob. I'm sorry. Welcome home. 
He shakes hands with his son, stiffly. 
ROBERT Thank you. 
LINCOLN PRESTON BLAIR (to Robert:) (pointedly:) I'm talking to Preston Blair, You're looking fit, Robert. we - Harvard agrees with you. Fit ROBERT and rested. Mr. Blair. 
LINCOLN (dismissing Robert, UNINTENTIONALLY ABRUPT) Just give us a moment please, Robert. Thank you. 
He turns to Preston. Robert, stung, hesitates, then leaves the room, Nicolay shutting the door behind him. 
PRESTON BLAIR I will procure your votes for you, as I promised. You've always kept your word to me. Those Southern men are coming. (taking Lincoln's hand) I beg you, in the name of Gentle CHRIST - 
PRESTON BLAIR (CONT'D) LINCOLN Talk peace with these men. Preston, I understand... 
LINCOLN (SHARPLY) I understand, Preston. 
EXT. ON THE MALL - AFTERNOON 
JACOB GRAYLOR (D, PA) and Bilbo walk outside the Capitol. Graylor looks over the prospectuses. 
ROBERT LATHAM (V.O.) We have one abstention so far - 
RICHARD SCHELL (V.O.) Jacob Graylor - 
Graylor selects one and hands it to Bilbo. 
RICHARD SCHELL (V.O.) He'd like to be Federal Revenue Assessor for the Fifth District of Pennsylvania. 
INT. A BEDROOM IN THE ST. CHARLES HOTEL - NIGHT 
A small room, two beds, in disarray: newspapers, overflowing ashtrays, whiskey bottles empty on the floor. Latham and Schell stand at a table strewn with the remnants of a poker game. Bilbo lies on one of the beds. All three are in their shirtsleeves. Seward is at the table. 
ROBERT LATHAM - so the total of representatives voting three weeks from today is reduced to 182, which means 122 yes votes to reach the requisite two- thirds of the House. Assuming all Republicans vote for the amendment...? 
Seward nods, less assertively than Latham would like. 
ROBERT LATHAM (CONT'D) Then, despite our abstention, to reach a two-thirds majority we remain 20 yeses short. 
INT. THE OLD TAVERN, WASHINGTON - NIGHT 
Bilbo is drinking schooners of beer with EDWIN LECLERK (D, OH) and CLAY HAWKINS (D, OH). Hawkins listens as Bilbo gives his pitch. LeClerk looks at the prospectuses. 
Bilbo walks with Clay Hawkins, who peruses the folio. Bilbo has a small covered wicker basket slung over his shoulder. Hawkins follows, happy and sick with fear. 
CLAY HAWKINS T-tax collector for the Western Reserve. Th-th-that pays handsomely. 
W.N. BILBO Don't just reach for the highest branches. They sway in every breeze. Assistant Port Inspector of Marlston looks like the ticket to me. 
CLAY HAWKINS Uh, boats, they, they make me sick. 
Bilbo retrieves a snare; a small bird is trapped by the foot. Bilbo stuffs the bird in the basket. 
CLAY HAWKINS (CONT'D) So just stand on the dock. Let the Assistant Assistant Port Inspector's stomach go weak. 
Bilbo eyes Hawkins, who anxiously eyes the folio. 
INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - EARLY EVENING 
Seward hands the last prospectus to Nicolay, who unfolds it, places it on top of the other prospectuses, and records details about Hawkins's appointment in a notebook. Seward smokes a cigar, Nicolay a pipe. Lincoln sits, feet up, examining a newspaper. 
SEWARD And lastly, Democratic yes vote number six. Hawkins from Ohio. 
LINCOLN Six. 
SEWARD Well, thus far. Plus Graylor's abstention. From tiny acorns and so on. 
LINCOLN What'd Hawkins get? 
JOHN NICOLAY (STILL WRITING:) Postmaster of the Millersburg Post Office. 
LINCOLN He's selling himself cheap, ain't he? 
SEWARD He wanted tax collector of the Western Reserve - a first-term congressman who couldn't manage re- election, I felt it unseemly and they bargained him down to Postmaster. (TO NICOLAY:) Scatter `em over several rounds of appointments, so no one notices. And burn this ledger, please, after you're done. 
Lincoln stands. 
LINCOLN (TO NICOLAY:) Time for my public opinion bath. Might as well let `em in. 
Nicolay helps Lincoln trade his shawl for his overcoat in preparation to meet the public. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) Seven yeses with Mr. Ellis! Thirteen to go! 
SEWARD One last item, an absurdity, but - My associates report that among the Representatives a fantastical rumor's bruited about, which I immediately disavowed, that you'd allowed bleary old Preston Blair to sojourn to Richmond to invite Jeff Davis to send commissioners up to Washington with a peace plan. 
Lincoln is silent. A horrifying reality dawns for Seward: 
SEWARD (CONT'D) I, of course, told them you would never...Not without consulting me, you wouldn't...Because why on earth would you? 
EXT. IN AN OPEN FIELD NEAR PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA - EVENING 
THREE UNION CAVALRY OFFICERS consult with THREE CONFEDERATE CAVALRY OFFICERS, all mounted. The officers exchange documents and salutes. 
TITLE: NO MAN'S LAND 
OUTSIDE PETERSBURG, VIRGINIA 
JANUARY 11 
The ranking Confederate trots to a buggy in which three Confederate officials sit: Vice President ALEXANDER STEPHENS, 53, short; JOHN A. CAMPBELL, Assistant Secretary of War, 54; and Senator R.M.T. HUNTER, 56. They're well-dressed for winter, Stephens especially heavily bundled. 
Stephens, Campbell and the indignant Hunter leave the buggy and are escorted by Confederate officers to the waiting company of Union cavalry and infantry. 
A Union Army ambulance, a large American flag painted on one side, driven by TWO BLACK SOLDIERS, stands near broken wagons and a derelict cannon. ANOTHER BLACK SOLDIER stands at attention by the ambulance's rear door. 
The soldier, staring coldly at these men, gestures brusquely to the ambulance. The Confederate peace commissioners hesitate; Hunter stares in horror at the black soldiers. Then Stephens pushes past Hunter. He nods to the soldier. 
ALEXANDER STEPHENS (with polite dignity:) Much obliged. 
He boards the ambulance. His fellow delegates follow in his wake, Hunter glaring with defiant hatred at the soldiers before climbing in. 
INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, WHITE HOUSE - EARLY EVENING 
Seward stands, stunned. Lincoln sits at the cabinet table. Nicolay is gone. 
SEWARD Why wasn't I consulted?! I'm Secretary of State! You, you, you informally send a reactionary dottard, to - What will happen, do you imagine, when these peace commissioners arrive? 
LINCOLN We'll hear `em out. 
WILLIAM SLADE I was born a free man. Nobody beat me except I beat them right back. 
There's a knock on the door and Mrs. Keckley enters. 
ELIZABETH KECKLEY Mr. Lincoln, could you come with me- 
WILLIAM SLADE (TO TAD:) Mrs. Keckley was a slave. Ask her if she was beaten. 
TAD LINCOLN Were you - (shakes his head) Tad. 
ELIZABETH KECKLEY (TO TAD:) I was beaten with a fire shovel when I was younger than you. (TO LINCOLN:) You should go to Mrs. Lincoln. She's in Willie's room. 
ROBERT She never goes in there. 
Lincoln starts towards the door just as John Hay enters, dressed in the uniform of a Brevet Colonel. 
JOHN HAY The reception line is already stretching out the door. 
Robert shoots an angry, envious glance at Hay's uniform as Lincoln, Slade, Mrs. Keckley and Hay leave. Robert calls to HIS FATHER: 
ROBERT I'll be the only man over fifteen and under sixty-five in this whole place not in uniform. 
TAD I'm under fifteen and I have a uniform. 
Robert storms out. 
INT. THE PRINCE OF WALES BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Lincoln enters a dark room, its heavy drapes closed against the dim afternoon light. There are two beds. One is stripped bare. The other is canopied with a thick black veil. 
Mary, dressed in a deep purple gown with black flowers and beading, perfectly pitched between mourning and emergence, is seated at the head of the canopied bed. On a nightstand next to the bed there's a toy locomotive engine, a tattered book of B&O railroad schedules. 
Mary holds a framed photograph: an image of WILLIE, 12, handsome, bright-eyed, confident. 
Lincoln crosses to the window. 
MARY My head hurts so. (BEAT) I prayed for death the night Willie died. The headaches are how I know I didn't get my wish. How to endure the long afternoon and deep into the night. 
LINCOLN I know. 
MARY Trying not to think about him. How will I manage? 
LINCOLN Somehow you will. 
MARY (SAD SMILE:) Somehow. Somehow. Somehow... Every party, every... And now, four years more in this terrible house reproaching us. He was a very sick little boy. We should've cancelled that reception, shouldn't we? 
LINCOLN We didn't know how sick he was. 
MARY I knew, I knew, I saw that night he was dying. 
LINCOLN Three years ago, the war was going so badly, and we had to put on a face. 
MARY But I saw Willie was dying. I saw HIM - 
He bends and kisses her hand. 
LINCOLN Molly. It's too hard. Too hard. 
Mary stares up at him, her face heavy and swollen with grief. 
INT. THE EAST ROOM, WHITE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Mary, radiant, her charm turned to its brightest candlepower, is greeting the Blairs, who are part of a long receiving line. The Blairs proceed from Mary to Lincoln. 
TITLE: GRAND RECEPTION 
JANUARY 15 
The enormous room is splendid, decked with garlands of flowers, tall candelabra burning, flags from Army divisions. An orchestra plays. 
Lincoln and Tad stand together. Slade is near Lincoln. Mary's a distance away from Lincoln, to his right. 
Robert takes his place next to his mother, as conspicuous as he'd feared he'd be in his civilian clothes. 
A sea of people surround the President and his family. Nicolay, Hay and several clerks channel the crowd waiting to greet the Lincolns into the line: wealthy people, many more middle-class people, some working people and farmers, and many officers and soldiers. 
ASA VINTNER LITTON They'll be free, George! That's what'll become of them! What'll become of any of us?! That's what being free means! 
Schell, Latham, and Bilbo are perched in their usual gallery seats, taking notes. 
RICHARD SCHELL Think how splendid if Mr. Yeaman switched. 
ROBERT LATHAM (shaking his head:) Too publicly against us. He can't change course now. 
W.N. BILBO Not for some miserable little job anyways. 
GEORGE YEAMAN And, and! We will be forced to enfranchise the men of the colored race - it would be inhuman not to! Who among us is prepared to give Negroes the vote? 
He's momentarily silenced by cheers and boos throughout the chamber. 
GEORGE YEAMAN (CONT'D) And, and! What shall follow upon that? Universal enfranchisement? Votes for women? 
Yeaman is stopped, baffled and dismayed by the explosion he's provoked. 
INT. AN EMPTY COMMITTEE ROOM, THE CAPITOL - DAY 
Hawkins enters and stops when he sees Pendleton and Wood. It's a trap. LeClerk follows, closing the door. 
FERNANDO WOOD Bless my eyes, if it isn't the Post Master of Millersburg Ohio! 
Hawkins looks at LeClerk, who guiltily avoids his glance. 
GEORGE PENDLETON Mr. LeClerk felt honor-bound to inform us. Of your disgusting betrayal. Your prostitution. 
FERNANDO WOOD Is that true, Postmaster Hawkins? Is your maidenly virtue for sale? 
Hawkins sinks. 
EXT. A WOODS ALONG THE POTOMAC RIVER - MORNING 
Bilbo and Clay Hawkins are again in the woods. Bilbo, with his basket, clutches a pair of noisy snared partridges. 
CLAY HAWKINS My neighbors hear that I voted yes for nigger freedom and no to peace, they will kill me. 
W.N. BILBO A deal's a deal and you men know better than to piss your pants just cause there's talk about peace talks. 
W.N. BILBO (CONT'D) CLAY HAWKINS My neighbors in Nashville, Look, I'll find another job. they found out I was loyal to the Union, they came after me with gelding knives! 
Hawkins runs away from Bilbo. Bilbo chases him. CLAY HAWKINS W.N. BILBO (to himself, as he YOU DO RIGHT, CLAY HAWKINS! runs:) AND MAKE YOURSELF SOME MONEY Any other job. IN THE BARGAIN - 
CLAY HAWKINS (turning back to Bilbo:) I want to do right! But I got no courage!!! 
Hawkins runs away, sobbing. Bilbo pursues. 
W.N. BILBO Wait!! You wanted, what was it, tax man for the Western Reserve, hell you can have the whole state of Ohio if you - 
Bilbo stops, winded. 
W.N. BILBO (CONT'D) Aw, crap. 
EXT. IN A BACK ALLEY, SOMEWHERE IN WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON 
Seward, smoking unhappily, strides toward his carriage, with Schell, Latham and Bilbo in pursuit. 
SEWARD Eleven votes?! Two days ago we had twelve!! What happened? 
RICHARD SCHELL ROBERT LATHAM It's the goddamned rumors There are defections in the regarding the Richmond ranks... Yes! The peace delegation. offer! 
SEWARD ROBERT LATHAM Groundless. I told you that. And yet the rumors persist. 
RICHARD SCHELL They are ruining us. 
RICHARD SCHELL Among the few remaining representatives who seem remotely plausible there is a perceptible increase in resistance. 
Seward has reached the carriage, Bilbo alongside him. Before the Secretary of State can climb on board, Bilbo shuts the carriage door. Seward is outraged. 
W.N. BILBO Resistance, hell! Thingamabob Hollister, Dem from Indiana? I approached him, the sumbitch near to murdered me! 
EXT. A STREET IN GEORGETOWN - NIGHT 
Bilbo is talking to HAROLD HOLLISTER (D, IN), who pulls out a derringer. Bilbo bolts, dropping the folder. He stops, runs back, and bends to retrieve the folio as Hollister fires the gun over Bilbo's head. 
INT. HOUSE CHAMBER, THE CAPITOL - LATER 
Stevens, at the podium, is being challenged by Fernando Wood, standing at his desk. 
FERNANDO WOOD I've asked you a question, Mr. Stevens, and you must answer me. Do you or do you not hold that the precept that "all men are created equal" is meant literally? 
All eyes are on Stevens, the chamber quiet except for a scratching sound: the journalists have begun scribbling. 
FERNANDO WOOD (CONT'D) Is that not the true purpose of the amendment? To promote your ultimate and ardent dream to elevate - 
THADDEUS STEVENS The true purpose of the amendment, Mr. Wood, you perfectly-named, brainless, obstructive object? 
FERNANDO WOOD You have always insisted, Mr. Stevens, that Negroes are the same as white men are. 
THADDEUS STEVENS The true purpose of the amendment - 
Stevens looks up at the balcony, at the waiting journalists, and Mary, who raises her eyebrows, then at Ashley and Litton at their desks. Seward watches from the balcony. 
Stevens returns to Wood. 
THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D) I don't hold with equality in all things only with equality before the law and nothing more. 
FERNANDO WOOD (SURPRISED:) That's not so! You believe that Negroes are entirely equal to white men. You've said it a thousand TIMES - 
GEORGE PENDLETON (leaping to his feet) For shame! For shame! Stop prevaricating and answer Representative Wood! 
THADDEUS STEVENS GEORGE PENDLETON I don't hold with equality in (stands:) all things, only with After the decades of fervent equality before the law and advocacy on behalf of the nothing more. colored race - 
JAMES ASHLEY (LEAPING UP:) He's answered your questions! This amendment has naught to do with race equality! 
Pendleton persists, through cheers and catcalls. 
GEORGE PENDLETON THADDEUS STEVENS You have long insisted, have I don't hold with equality in you not, that the dusk- all things only with equality colored race is no different before the law and nothing from the white one. more. 
Among the amendment's supporters, including Vintner Litton, a GROUP OF WOMEN SUFFRAGISTS in the balcony, and Elizabeth Keckley, there's visible, audible shock and dismay at Stevens's capitulation. Mary's surprised by Stevens, and impressed. 
MARY (whispering to Mrs. KECKLEY:) Who'd ever've guessed that old nightmare capable of such control? He might make a politician someday - 
ELIZABETH KECKLEY (STANDING ABRUPTLY:) I need to go. 
Mary's startled. Mrs. Keckley leaves the balcony, pushing past journalists. On the floor: 
GEORGE PENDLETON Your frantic attempt to delude us now is unworthy of a representative. It is, in fact, unworthy of a white man! 
THADDEUS STEVENS (giving in to his anger:) How can I hold that all men are created equal, when here before me - (pointing to Pendleton:) - stands stinking the moral carcass of the gentleman from Ohio, proof that some men are inferior, endowed by their Maker with dim wits impermeable to reason with cold pallid slime in their veins instead of hot red blood! You are more reptile than man, George, so low and flat that the foot of man is incapable of crushing you! 
General uproar. 
GEORGE PENDLETON HOW DARE YOU! 
THADDEUS STEVENS Yet even you, Pendleton, who should have been gibbetted for treason long before today, even worthless unworthy you ought to be treated equally before the law! And so again, sir, and again and again and 
again I say: I DO NOT HOLD WITH EQUALITY IN ALL THINGS. ONLY WITH EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW. 
Ashley sits, nearly weeping with relief, while the chamber explodes: laughter, applause, boos. 
GEORGE PENDLETON MR. SPEAKER, WILL YOU PERMIT THIS VILE BOORISH MAN TO SLANDER AND TO THREATEN ME AND - 
The journalists pack up their notebooks; this is fun, but not newsworthy, and only a few bother to record it. 
Stevens limps out through the aisle to wild Republican applause. He looks up to the balcony; Mary is looking down approvingly. He looks down before she can see him smile. 
INT. A CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE HOUSE CHAMBER - LATER 
Stevens sits on a bench, alone, thinking, troubled. Asa Vintner Litton approaches him. 
ASA VINTNER LITTON You asked if ever I was surprised. 
Stevens nods. 
ASA VINTNER LITTON (CONT'D) Today, Mr. Stevens, I was surprised. You've led the battle for race equality for thirty years! The basis of, of every hope for this country's future life, you denied Negro equality! I'm nauseated. You refused to say that all humans are, well... human! Have you lost your very soul, Mr. Stevens? Is there nothing you won't say? 
Stevens nods, then, quietly: 
THADDEUS STEVENS I'm sorry you're nauseous, Asa, that must be unpleasant. I want the amendment to pass. So that the Constitution's first and only mention of slavery is its absolute prohibition. For this amendment, for which I have worked all of my life and for which 
LINCOLN (O.C.) What's the matter, Bob? 
Robert looks up, mortified, to see Lincoln watching him with concern. He wipes his eyes, his mouth. 
ROBERT I have to do this! And I will do it and I don't need your permission to enlist. 
LINCOLN That same speech has been made by how many sons to how many fathers since the war began? "I don't need your damn permission, you miserable old goat, I'm gonna enlist anyhow!" And what wouldn't those numberless fathers have given to be able to say to their sons - as I now say to mine - "I'm commander-in-chief, so in point of fact, without my permission, you ain't enlisting in nothing, nowhere, young man." 
ROBERT It's mama you're scared of, not me getting killed. 
Lincoln slaps Robert in the face. It shocks them both. 
Lincoln tries to embrace Robert, but Robert shoulders past him and walks back toward the front of he building. He turns. 
ROBERT (CONT'D) I have to do this! And I will! Or I will feel ashamed of myself for the rest of my life. Whether or not you fought is what's gonna matter. And not just to other people, but to myself. I won't be you, pa. I can't do that. But I don't want to be nothing. 
He hurries away. 
LINCOLN We can't lose you. 
INT. MARY'S BOUDOIR, SECOND FLOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE - NIGHT 
Outside, driving rain and wind. Lincoln sits by the window, in his coat, vest and tie, hair combed neatly. 
LINCOLN He'll be fine, Molly. City Point's far from the front lines, from the fighting, he'll be an adjutant running messages for General Grant. 
Mary sits at her vanity in a beautiful evening dress, pale with rage. 
MARY The war will take our son! A sniper, or a shrapnel shell! Or typhus, same as took Willie, it takes hundreds of boys a day! He'll die, uselessly, and how will I ever forgive you? Most men, their firstborn is their favorite, but you, you've always blamed Robert for being born, for trapping you in a marriage that's only ever given you grief and caused you regret! 
LINCOLN That's not true - 
MARY And if the slaughter of Cold Harbor is on your hands same as Grant, God help us! We'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood you've sanctioned, the uncountable corpses we'll be made to pay with our son's dear BLOOD - 
Lincoln rises from the window seat, angry. 
LINCOLN Just, just this once, Mrs. Lincoln, I demand of you to try and take the liberal and not the selfish point of view! You imagine Robert will forgive us if we continue to stifle his very natural ambition?! 
MARY (with a mocking smile:) And if I refuse to take the high road, if I won't take up the rough old cross, will you threaten me again with the madhouse, as you did when I couldn't stop crying over Willie, when I showed you what heartbreak, real heartbreak looked like, and you hadn't the courage to countenance it, to help me - 
LINCOLN MARY That's right. When you I was in the room with refused so much as to comfort Willie, I was holding him in Tad - my arms as he died! 
LINCOLN MARY - the child who was not only How dare you! sick, dangerously sick, but beside himself with grief? 
LINCOLN MARY Oh but your grief, your How dare you throw that at grief, your inexhaustible me?! grief! 
LINCOLN MARY And his mother won't let him I couldn't let Tad in! I near her, `cause she's couldn't risk him seeing how screaming from morning to angry I was! night pacing the corridors, howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts! I ought to have done it, I ought have done for Tad's sake, for everybody's goddamned sake, I should have clapped you in the madhouse! 
MARY (CONT'D) THEN DO IT! Do it! Don't you threaten me, you do it this time! Lock me away! You'll have to, I swear, if Robert is killed! 
Silence. Then: 
LINCOLN I couldn't tolerate you grieving so for Willie because I couldn't permit it in myself, though I wanted to, Mary. I wanted to crawl under the earth, into the vault with his coffin. I still do. Every day I do. Don't... talk to me about grief. (BEAT:) I must make my decisions, Bob must make his, you yours. And bear what we must, hold and carry what we must. What I carry within me - you must allow me to do it, alone as I must. And you alone, Mary, you alone may lighten this burden, or render it intolerable. As you choose. 
She opens her mouth to make an angry reply, then stops, and watches as he leaves the room. 
INT. ODD FELLOWS' HALL, WASHINGTON - NIGHT 
Onstage, Gounod's Faust, Act Three, scene eight, the garden outside Marguerite's cottage, a gorgeously romantic night. MARGUERITE and FAUST are alone singing. The Lincolns, in their box, watch quietly. Elizabeth Keckley sits next to Mary. 
Mary turns to Lincoln. They speak in whispers. Mrs. Keckley tries not to listen but she can't help hearing what they say. 
MARY You think I'm ignorant of what you're up to because you haven't discussed this scheme with me as you ought to have done. When have I ever been so easily bamboozled? (BEAT) I believe you when you insist that amending the constitution and abolishing slavery will end this war. And since you are sending my son into the war, woe unto you if you fail to pass the amendment. 
LINCOLN Seward doesn't want me leaving big muddy footprints all over town. 
MARY No one ever lived who knows better than you the proper placement of footfalls on treacherous paths. Seward can't do it. You must. Because if you fail to secure the necessary votes, woe unto you, sir. You will answer to me. 
EXT. THE PORTICO OF THE WHITE HOUSE - A SHORT WHILE LATER 
The carriage has pulled up and Mary is entering the White House. Lincoln helps Mrs. Keckley down from the carriage. 
She hesitates before proceeding in. Then she faces Lincoln. 
ELIZABETH KECKLEY I know the vote is only four days away; I know you're concerned. Thank you for your concern over this, and I want you to know: They'll approve it. God will see to it. 
W.N. BILBO Sure. 
LINCOLN Snagged my eye in the paper this morning. Governor Curtin is set to declare a winner in the disputed Congressional election for the - 
W.N. BILBO Pennsylvania 16th District. 
LINCOLN What a joy to be comprehended. Hop on a train to Philadell, call on the Governor - 
SEWARD (looking askance at BILBO'S APPEARANCE:) Send Latham. Or Schell. 
LINCOLN (TO BILBO:) No, he'll do fine, just polish yourself up first. 
Bilbo, cigar back in mouth, laughs. 
ROBERT LATHAM The incumbent is claiming he won it. Name of, uh... 
W.N. BILBO Coffroth. 
LINCOLN That's him. 
RICHARD SCHELL Coffroth. He is a Democrat. 
LINCOLN W.N. BILBO I understand he is. Silly name. Let Governor Curtin know it'd be much appreciated if he'd invite the House of Representatives to decide who won. He's entitled to do that. He'll agree to it. (TO SCHELL:) Then advise Coffroth, if he hopes to retain his seat, that he'd better pay a visit to Thaddeus Stevens. 
SEWARD Pity poor Coffroth. 
INT. THADDEUS STEVENS'S OFFICE, THE CAPITOL - NIGHT 
Stevens is at his desk, paperwork piled high. There's a knock at the door. 
THADDEUS STEVENS It opens! 
A nervous man enters hesitantly: Alexander Coffroth. 
Stevens glares at him with what looks like horror. Coffroth's frightened smile transforms into a rictus of pain. Then: 
THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D) You are Canfrey? 
ALEXANDER COFFROTH Coffroth, Mr. Stevens, Alexander Coffroth, I'm, I'm - 
THADDEUS STEVENS (SKEPTICAL) Are we representatives of the same state? 
ALEXANDER COFFROTH Y-yes sir! We sit only three desks APART - 
Stevens waves him into a chair. 
THADDEUS STEVENS I haven't noticed you. I'm a Republican, and you, Coughdrop, are a Democrat? 
ALEXANDER COFFROTH Well, I... Um, that is to say... I - 
THADDEUS STEVENS The modern travesty of Thomas Jefferson's political organization to which you have attached yourself like a barnacle has the effrontery to call itself The Democratic Party. You are a Dem-o-crat. What's the matter with you? Are you wicked? 
ALEXANDER COFFROTH Well, I felt, um, formerly, I - 
THADDEUS STEVENS Never mind, Coffsnot. You were ignominiously trounced at the hustings in November's election by your worthy challenger, a REPUBLICAN - 
ALEXANDER COFFROTH No, sir, I was not, um, trounced! Uh, he wants to steal my seat! I didn't lose the election - 
THADDEUS STEVENS What difference does it make if you lost or not?! The governor of our state, is...? A Democrat? 
ALEXANDER COFFROTH No, he's a... (baffled, terrified:) A, um, a Ruh... 
THADDEUS STEVENS Re. 
ALEXANDER COFFROTH Re. 
THADDEUS STEVENS (NODS) Pub. 
ALEXANDER COFFROTH Pub. 
THADDEUS STEVENS Li. 
ALEXANDER COFFROTH Li. 
THADDEUS STEVENS Can. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) My deepest sympathies to your family. 
Lincoln goes back to his buggy. Hutton pauses at his door to watch Lincoln's buggy drive away. 
INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Lincoln is seated at the head of the cabinet table along with Seward. Ashley, Preston and Montgomery Blair. Hay and Nicolay sit in their usual chairs. 
PRESTON BLAIR (ANGRY:) We've managed our members to a fare- thee-well, you've had no defections from the Republican right to trouble you, whereas as to what you promised - Where the hell are the commissioners?! 
JAMES ASHLEY Oh God... (TO LINCOLN:) It's true! You, you...lied to me, Mr. Lincoln! You evaded my requests for a denial that, that there is a Confederate peace offer because, because there is one! We are absolutely guaranteed to lose the whole thing - 
JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D) MONTGOMERY BLAIR - and we'll be discredited, We don't need a goddamned the amendment itself will be abolition amendment! Leave tainted. What if, what if the Constitution alone! State these peace commissioners by state you can extirpate - appear today? Or worse, on the morning - 
LINCOLN I can't listen to this anymore! I can't accomplish a goddamned thing of any human meaning or worth until we cure ourselves of slavery and end this pestilential war, and whether any of you or anyone else knows it, I know I need this! This amendment is that cure! We're stepped out upon the world's stage now, now, with the fate of human dignity in our hands! Blood's been spilt to afford us this moment! 
He points around the table at Ashley, Monty, Preston. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) Now now now! And you grousle and heckle and dodge about like pettifogging Tammany Hall hucksters! See what is before you! See the here and now! That's the hardest thing, the only thing that accounts! Abolishing slavery by constitutional provision settles the fate, for all coming time, not only of the millions now in bondage but of unborn millions to come. Two votes stand in its way, and these votes must be procured. 
SEWARD We need two yeses, three abstentions, or four yeses and one more abstention and the amendment will pass - 
LINCOLN You got a night and a day and a night and several perfectly good hours! Now get the hell out of here and get `em! 
JAMES ASHLEY Yes but how? 
LINCOLN Buzzards' guts, man. 
Lincoln rises, and keeps rising, till he seems eight feet tall. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) I am the President of the United States of America, clothed in immense power! You will procure me these votes. 
INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - DAWN 
The chamber is quiet and dark. Pages and clerks prepare the desks, laying out pens and paper, filling inkwells. 
TITLE: THE MORNING OF THE VOTE 
JANUARY 31, 1865 
A CLERK is draping red-white-and-blue bunting on the desks of representatives from seceded states. These will of course remain unoccupied during the vote. 
The first Congressman to arrive, Thaddeus Stevens clumps in. He goes to his desk and sits. He looks around the empty chamber, ready and waiting. 
INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER - MORNING, SEVERAL HOURS LATER 
Thaddeus Stevens is at his desk. The House is in session, the floor full of congressmen caucusing and arguing. 
The balcony's packed. Mary and Keckley sit at the front, Nicolay and Hay behind them. The Blairs are among other officials, rich people, foreign dignitaries. 
There's a sudden quiet, then murmuring. Ashley, Stevens and everyone on the floor look up, Ellis, Hollister, Hutton and Hawkins among these. 
In the balcony, twenty WELL-TO-DO BLACK PEOPLE, mostly men, are escorted by several Senators, including Sumner and Wade, to a reserved section of the balcony. The black people glance at their surroundings but are rigidly composed. 
Asa Vintner Litton sees them enter. He looks about, at the representatives caucusing, or staring up at the visitors. Something powerful strikes him. In a voice coarse with emotion, he calls up to the black visitors: 
ASA VINTNER LITTON We welcome you, ladies and gentlemen, first in the history of this people's chamber, to your House! 
There's tense applause. Some of the black guests bow; most aren't sure how to respond. 
Yeaman watches this, deeply moved. 
Bilbo catches Hawkins's eye and waves. Hawkins looks anxiously around, blushing. 
Everyone is seated, and the place is packed. 
Schuyler Colfax is in his high seat atop the rostrum, the SERGEANT-AT-ARMS to his right. Colfax gavels the House into session. Ashley is at the podium. 
SCHUYLER COLFAX Mr. Ashley, the floor is yours. 
JAMES ASHLEY On the matter of the joint resolution before us, presenting a Thirteenth Amendment to our national Constitution, which was passed last year by the Senate, and which has been debated now by this estimable body for the past several weeks. Today we will vote... 
Cheers, boos, applause. 
JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D) By mutual agreement we shall hear brief final statements - 
W.N. BILBO You gonna have a chat now, with with the whole of the House of Representatives waiting on that? 
Nicolay continues gasping, trying to speak. He can't. 
JOHN HAY (TO LINCOLN:) Making false representation to Congress is, it's, um - 
JOHN NICOLAY It's, it's - 
LINCOLN Impeachable. I've made no false representation. 
JOHN HAY But there are - (WHISPERING:) 
There is a delegation from Richmond. 
LINCOLN Give me the note, Johnnie. 
Hay gives Lincoln the note. Lincoln takes it, holding on to Hay's hand; with his free hand, Lincoln passes the note to Bilbo. 
LINCOLN (CONT'D) (TO BILBO:) Please deliver that to Mr. Ashley. 
INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND BALCONY - AFTERNOON 
Bilbo, pushing past the pages, runs in, holding the note, Ashley snatches it, reading as he makes his way to the podium. All eyes are on Ashley. 
JAMES ASHLEY From the President: 
The chamber falls silent. 
JAMES ASHLEY (CONT'D) "So far as I know, there are no peace commissioners in the city nor are there likely to be." 
Applause, booing, furious discussion. 
GEORGE PENDLETON "So far as I know-"?! That means nothing! Are there commissioners from the South or aren't there?! 
In the balcony, Mary looks to Mrs. Keckley. 
JAMES ASHLEY The President has answered you, sir! Your peace offer is a fiction! 
GEORGE PENDLETON That is not a denial, it is a lawyer's dodge! 
JAMES ASHLEY Mr. Haddam? Is your faction satisfied? 
Preston, in the balcony, hesitates. He looks at his daughter, who gives him a questioning look: "Do you want this on your head?" 
Preston doesn't. He indicates to Haddam with a small shake of his venerable head: "Drop it." 
AARON HADDAM The conservative Republican faction's satisfied, and we thank Mr. Lincoln. I move to table Mr. Wood's motion. 
SCHUYLER COLFAX Tabled! 
There's an angry response, but Wood and Pendleton sit, thwarted. 
JAMES ASHLEY Speaker Colfax, I order the main question. 
SCHUYLER COLFAX A motion has been made to bring the bill for the Thirteenth Amendment to a vote. Do I hear a second? 
ASA VINTNER LITTON I second the motion. 
SCHUYLER COLFAX So moved, so ordered. The Clerk will now - (a rap of the gavel) Quiet please. 
The noise of the chamber and balcony reduce to a rumble. 
SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D) The clerk will now call the roll for voting. 
Thaddeus Stevens sits silently, tired, concentrated: the moment has come. 
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE We begin with Connecticut. Mr. Augustus Benjamin, on the matter of this amendment, how say you? 
The chamber is completely silent for the first time. 
AUGUSTUS BENJAMIN Nay! 
The clerk records his vote. 
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Mr. Arthur Bentleigh. 
Grant turns his back on the proceedings to light a cigar. He's concerned at how close the vote is. Behind him the count CONTINUES: 
SERGEANT (CONT'D) Archibald Moran...yes. 
Robert has been looking at Grant; he returns to his score keeping. 
SERGEANT (CONT'D) Ambrose Bailer...yes. 
INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER AND BALCONY - AFTERNOON 
The Clerk continues. 
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Mr. Walter H. Washburn. 
WALTER H. WASHBURN Votes no. 
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE And Mr. George Yeaman, how say you? 
Yeaman doesn't respond. The silence this causes lengthens, till representatives begin to look to see what's happened. Yeaman sits, staring ahead, not responding. Thaddeus Stevens, sensing something's happening, looks in Yeaman's direction. Yeaman, still staring ahead, mumbles something, but it's inaudible. 
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE (CONT'D) Sorry Mr. Yeaman, I didn't hear you VOTE - 
GEORGE YEAMAN (rising to his feet) I said aye, Mr. McPherson. AYE!!! 
Great surprise, loud cheers and angry shouts. 
FERNANDO WOOD TRAITOR! TRAITOR! 
Yeaman looks ready to faint. To the consternation of the Democrats, a mob of gleeful Republicans rushes across the aisle that separates the two parties; they surround Yeaman, shaking his hand, slapping him on the back. Colfax bangs the gavel. 
SCHUYLER COLFAX Order! 
Pendleton is speechless. Litton turns to Ashley, both astonished; Ashley turns to Stevens, who watches, sharp, observant, giving nothing away. 
Mary updates her tally: "8 TO WIN" 
SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D) Order in the chamber! 
Yeaman collapses back into his seat. The room quiets. 
SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D) Mr. MacPherson, you may proceed. 
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Mr. Clay R. Hawkins of Ohio. 
Hawkins seems to have been startled out of a reverie. Sick with fear, he looks up at the sound of his name. He can't speak. Wood and Pendleton watch this, deeply alarmed. Hawkins snaps out of it. 
CLAY HAWKINS Goddamn it, I'm voting yes. 
A huge reaction to this. LeClerk gapes at Hawkins. 
CLAY HAWKINS (CONT'D) (right at Pendleton and Wood!) I don't care, shoot me dead! You shoot me dead I, I am voting yes! 
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Mr. Edwin F. LeClerk. 
LeClerk, seated next to Hawkins and transfixed by his courage, turns dazedly to McPherson. 
EDWIN LECLERK No. (then, standing abruptly:) Oh to hell with it, shoot me dead too. Yes! 
The noise gets wilder. Pendleton fixes LeClerk and Hawkins with a murderous look. 
EDWIN LECLERK (CONT'D) I mean, abstention. Abstention. 
Disgust briefly flashing across his face, McPherson crosses out and changes LeClerk's vote to an abstention. The cheering and booing degenerates to intense argument about what this means for the vote count. 
In the balcony, Bilbo looks at Hawkins, well-pleased. 
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Mr. Alexander Coffroth. 
Coffroth looks towards Stevens, who doesn't look at him. 
ALEXANDER COFFROTH (proud of himself and happy about the reward HE'LL GET:) I. Vote. Yes. 
Applause. Stevens still doesn't look at Coffroth, but, tickled, he grins and nods. 
INT. GRANT'S TELEGRAPH ROOM AT CITY POINT - AFTERNOON 
Laughter in the chamber. The Clerk tallies the vote, then passes the recorded vote to the Speaker. There's absolute silence. 
In the balcony, Mary checks her own tally, not quite believing it. 
SCHUYLER COLFAX (CONT'D) The final vote: eight absent or not voting, fifty six votes against, one hundred nineteen votes for. With a margin of two votes - 
INT. LINCOLN'S OFFICE, THE WHITE HOUSE - AFTERNOON 
Lincoln stands, waiting. The only sound is the ticking of the clock. And then the ticking is slowly drowned out as bells begin to peal throughout the city. Lincoln raises the window as Tad rushes to him. The bells are joined by a cannonade. The sound of jubilation fills his office. 
Lincoln turns from the window to Tad, who stares out eagerly, seeking out the source of the noise. Lincoln puts his hand on Tad's head. He looks down at his son, silent. 
INT. THE HOUSE CHAMBER, THE CAPITOL - LATE AFTERNOON 
Representatives throw papers in the air, embrace, weep, shout, dance, climb on desks. In the balcony, Mary stands slowly, beyond tears or joy; Mrs. Keckley stands with her, smiling, crying. Preston Blair applauds vigorously. The black visitors join the general exultation, overwhelmed, some praying, others embracing and weeping. 
Latham's, Schell's and Bilbo's seats are empty; they've gone. 
Ashley, grinning from ear to ear, tears streaming down his face, is hoisted up on shoulders and marched around the room, as on the floor and in the balcony, people start singing "The Battle Cry of Freedom." 
Pendleton, with the face of someone who's seen his world collapse into ruin, walks straight at Yeaman, who's listening to the singing, deeply moved, his face full of wonder. Pendleton turns, without a word, and leaves the House. 
Yeaman laughs, and loudly joins in singing. 
Stevens clumps over to the Clerk of the House, who is placing his tallies and the official copy of the amendment bill in a folio. He looks up. 
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE Congratulations, Mr. Chairman. 
THADDEUS STEVENS The bill, Mr. McPherson, may I...? 
The Clerk hands the bill to Stevens, who folds it and pockets it. 
THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE That's...That's the official bill. 
THADDEUS STEVENS I'll return it in the morning. Creased, but unharmed. 
EXT. A STREET, WASHINGTON - DUSK 
Celebrating crowds move towards the Mall, singing, carrying placards proclaiming the passage of the amendment. 
Thaddeus Stevens is hobbling in the opposite direction, making difficult headway against the crowd, pushed and shoved, unrecognized; he shoves back, his ferocious scowl utterly at odds with the prevailing festive mood. 
He reaches a modest house, unlocks the door and steps inside. 
INT. THADDEUS STEVENS'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Stevens is met at the door by LYDIA SMITH, a black woman in her fifties. As she helps him off with his coat, he takes a piece of paper from his pocket. 
THADDEUS STEVENS A gift for you. 
She takes it. 
THADDEUS STEVENS (CONT'D) The greatest measure of the Nineteenth Century. Passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America. 
INT. THE BEDROOM IN THADDEUS STEVENS'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Stevens, in his nightgown, takes off his wig. He's bald. 
He lies down in bed. Mrs. Smith is in bed already beside him. She's holding the paper he gave her. 
THADDEUS STEVENS I wish you'd been present. 
LYDIA SMITH I wish I'd been. 
THADDEUS STEVENS It was a spectacle. 
LYDIA SMITH You can't bring your housekeeper to the House. I won't give them gossip. (THE PAPER) This is enough. This is... It's more than enough for now. 
They kiss. He lies back. He grabs her hand. 
THADDEUS STEVENS Read it to me again, my love. 
LYDIA SMITH "PROPOSED -" 
THADDEUS STEVENS And adopted. 
As Lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield, grey and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle. 
He reaches the other side of the field, passing a Confederate flag to enter the now-ruined town of Petersburg. 
EXT. THE THOMAS WALLACE HOUSE, GRANT'S TEMPORARY HEADQUARTERS, ON MARKET STREET, PETERSBURG - MORNING 
Grant, smoking his cigar, his uniform dusty and rumpled, is sitting on the small porch. He stares piercingly at Lincoln, in a rocker next to him, watching his troops pass by as they move in to secure the conquered town. Lincoln closes his eyes. 
He has grown older, the skin around his eyes is cobwebbed with fine creases, and his hair's thinner, softer, suffused with grey. His brow has grown smoother. 
LINCOLN Once he surrenders, send his boys back to their homes, their farms, their shops. 
GRANT Yes sir, as we discussed. 
LINCOLN Liberality all around. No punishment. I don't want that. And the leaders - Jeff and the rest of `em - if they escape, leave the country while my back's turned, that wouldn't upset me none. 
When peace comes it mustn't just be hangings. 
GRANT By outward appearance, you're ten years older than you were a year ago. 
LINCOLN Some weariness has bit at my bones. (BEAT) I never seen the like of it before. What I seen today. Never seen the like of it before. 
GRANT You always knew that, what this was going to be. Intimate, and ugly. You must've needed to see it close when you decided to come down here. 
LINCOLN We've made it possible for one another to do terrible things. 
GRANT And we've won the war. Now you have to lead us out of it. 
EXT. THE MCLEAN HOUSE, APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA - AFTERNOON 
OFFICERS OF THE CONFEDERATE AND UNION ARMY stand around in the afternoon sun. Everyone's solemn, even stunned by what's just happened. No one is speaking. 
TITLE: APPOMATTOX COURTHOUSE, VIRGINIA 
APRIL 9, 1865 
ROBERT E. LEE comes down the steps of the McLean house, as a CONFEDERATE OFFICER brings his horse to him. His face is blank. Lee mounts his waiting horse. 
Lee should leave, having just surrendered to Grant inside; but he's immobile. Some of the officers of both sides look at Lee, some can't bear it. Lee tries out various expressions: pride, defiance, blankness. 
Grant stomps onto the porch of the house, followed by his staff. Among them is Robert Lincoln. 
Grant, lost in thought, stops, taken aback, realizing that Lee's still there, astride his horse. Everyone looks at the two men who look awkwardly at one another. 
Then Grant removes his famous slouch hat. Everyone freezes for a moment, and then one by one, the officers of the Union Army remove their hats. 
Lee is visibly moved by this gesture of respect. He raises his hat, briefly, only an inch from his head. Then, pulling slightly on his horse's reins, he rides away. 
EXT. A BUGGY RIDE THROUGH WASHINGTON - AFTERNOON 
A beautiful spring afternoon. Lincoln and Mary are riding in the buggy, driven by the old soldier. 
MARY You've an itch to travel? 
LINCOLN I'd like that. To the West by rail. 
MARY (shaking her head no:) Overseas. 
LINCOLN The Holy Land. 
MARY (a laugh, then:) Awfully pious for a man who takes his wife out buggy-riding on Good Friday. 
LINCOLN Jerusalem. Where David and Solomon walked. I dream of walking in that ancient city. 
She seems sadder. They ride in silence. 
MARY All anyone will remember of me is I was crazy and I ruined your happiness. 
LINCOLN Anyone thinks that doesn't understand, Molly. 
She nods; then, tenderly: 
MARY When they look at you, at what it cost to live at the heart of this, they'll wonder at it. They'll wonder at you. They should. But they should also look at the wretched woman by your side, if they want to understand what this was truly like. For an ordinary person. For anyone other than you. 
Lincoln laughs, takes her hand. She leans against him.

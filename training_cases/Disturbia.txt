OVER BLACK: 
KALE (V.O.) (tense) Do you think he sees us? 
JEFF (V.O.) No, he can't see us. But he feels us watching. 
FADE IN: 
DEEP BLUE WATER FILLS THE FRAME. 
And there... a few feet beneath the surface... something SHIMMERS in the sunlight. As ripples dissipate, we make out the shape of a bright yellow CRANKBAIT waiting patiently for its prey on the end of a 10-pound line. 
We hold on this for another silent beat... then -- a huge BLACK BASS suddenly swoops into frame, circling the bait! 
ON KALE BRECHT (17) AND HIS DAD, JEFF BRECHT (45) 
Both startle at the sight. Kale, a clean-cut all-American kid, reflexively yanks back on his rod and reel. 
KALE Whoa, did you see that thing? 
Kale anxiously winds the spool -- 
JEFF Settle down, slow it down... 
Jeff lightly puts his hand on Kale's, slowing the cranking to a slight, steady pull as we WIDEN TO REVEAL them standing near the stern of their 16-foot BASSMASTER. We are... 
1   EXT. BISHOP LAKE - DAY                                           1 
The undisturbed beauty of nature serves as our backdrop as we MOVE CLOSER to Kale and Jeff, taking note of their t- shirts: Jeff's has a silkscreened cartoon rendition of a Bass wearing aviator goggles with mounted missiles on its fins. Beneath it, the slogan: "Weapons of Bass Destruction." The fish on Kale's shirt wears a stock car uniform, a single word across the bottom: BASSCAR. 
As Jeff steadies Kale's hand and pulls away: 
JEFF You don't want to scare him off. You've got his attention, now just play with him. Tease him a little.

Kale and Jeff watch the water in anxious silence... Kale inching the line back toward the boat. One more crank, then -- 
The BLACK BASS suddenly ATTACKS THE LURE with a tremendous SLOSH OF HIS TAIL! 
KALE Holy shit! 
JEFF It's all you, Kale, keep cranking! 
Kale cranks fast and furious.    But this is one fish that's going down fighting. 
KALE I need reinforcements! 
Jeff moves in, grabs the rod and reel from behind Kale. 
JEFF Heave, laddie! 
They PULL.    The rod curls under the weight. 
JEFF (CONT'D) (pirate accent) Give it all ya got, mate, or you're gonna lose him! 
KALE (laughing; pulling; struggling) Dad, your pirate -- impersonation -- sucks!! 
JEFF How would ya know, have ya ever met one? I doubt it -- 
The BASS SLOSHES FURIOUSLY around the bait, now just a few feet from the boat! 
KALE He's freakin' pulling us in! 
JEFF (laughing) Never! No Brecht has ever -- lost a fight -- to a fish! 
The BASS suddenly snaps free. The line goes limp. Jeff and Kale lose their balance, nearly falling backward. Then -- 
(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso 
1   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                     1 
All becomes silent save for Jeff and Kale's heavy breathing. Kale winds the empty line back to the boat, shoots a glance to Jeff, then throws the rod aside in mock disgust. Jeff takes a seat in the captain's chair. 
JEFF (CONT'D) Throw me a -- 
Kale is already in the cooler. He throws Jeff a Coke.        Both sit in silence for a beat. Then -- 
JEFF (CONT'D) Hey, at least the weather's great... we're spending quality time together. 
JEFF I'm fine. But you're gonna have to climb out, Kale. Can you do that? 
Kale's hands shake from the SHOCK as his fingers search for the seatbelt buckle. But the shoulder strap is LOCKED IN PLACE, preventing Kale from turning. He tugs it furiously. 
KALE I can't -- It won't give -- 
JEFF That's okay, I've got it -- grab the door, I don't need your ass falling on my face -- 
Kale reaches up, grips the outside of the door as 
JEFF'S HAND 
shakily reaches to Kale's seatbelt buckle and presses. Kale's belt SNAPS LOOSE. Kale's body DROPS, but he hangs on to the window -- just as a 
GUARDRAIL BEAM SNAPS LOOSE FROM ITS FOUNDATION! 
(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso 
7   CONTINUED:                                                               7 
The SUV ROCKS VIOLENTLY as the guardrail starts to bend and peel away from the cliffside under the SUV's weight. 
8   INSIDE THE SUV - JEFF                                                    8 
reaches up, grabs Kale's legs and pushes, helping Kale climb out the window. 
9   OUTSIDE THE SUV - KALE                                                   9 
slowly slides down the outside of the door, then turns around on his chest, reaches his hand back down to Jeff -- 
KALE Dad, here -- 
Jeff reaches up as a 
SECTION OF GUARDRAIL RIVETS 
a few inches behind the SUV's rear bumper suddenly POP LOOSE. THE GUARDRAIL SNAPS IN TWO! 
KALE SCREAMS, hangs on for dear life as the GUARDRAIL and SUV SWING OUT AND OVER THE RAVINE. 
The guardrail is buckling fast. Another beam RIPS FREE of its foundation -- Kale slides a few more inches down the door and right front fender allowing 
HIS FEET 
to find the edge of the foundering rail underneath.        Having at least some footing, Kale reaches back inside -- 
KALE (CONT'D) Dad, please, you can do it -- 
Jeff unbuckles his belt and reaches up. Kale summons his strength, grabs Jeff's wrist, pulls him up and through the passenger window just as the 
SUV FALLS AWAY! 
Jeff's weight pulls Kale down. Kale's feet SLIP off the rail. Kale SLAMS chest down, his TORSO wrapping around the top of the rail, feet dangling... But he's still clutching Jeff's wrist as the SUV CRASHES INTO THE RAVINE IN A MUSHROOM CLOUD OF DUST AND DEBRIS. 
JEFF'S WRIST 
slips from Kale's grasp. Kale struggles to hang on, but he's losing the battle and the balancing act. And he knows it. Tears well in Kale's eyes.

JEFF Kale, you have to climb up -- 
KALE No -- I'm not leaving -- 
JEFF Kale -- 
Another GUARDRAIL BEAM UPROOTS -- 
KALE NO -- Dad, please, I've got you -- 
JEFF (with a slight smile) I know -- 
CU - Jeff's left hand enters frame, clasps Kale's. Another beat of eyes on eyes. The guardrail continues to BUCKLE. Then -- Jeff starts to PRY KALE'S HAND AWAY -- 
Jeff's arm RELEASES FROM KALE'S GRIP.    Kale opens his mouth to scream as a shrill bell RINGS! 
10   INT. MORROW HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                              10 
ON THE RINGING BELL. STUDENTS disappear into their respective classrooms. As the corridor quiets down... 
SUPER: ONE YEAR LATER 
RONNIE (V.O.)                    RONNIE (CONT'D) (prelap)                         (subtitles as needed) Este verano, después             This summer, after visiting de visitar Hawaii,               Hawaii, I will perhaps quizás visitaré a mis            visit my grandparents in abuelos en Corea.                Korea. 
11   INT. CLASSROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    11 
ON RONNIE YUN, 16, a scrawny Korean kid with a knack for perfect Spanish, stands at the front giving his speech. 
Note: every time Ronnie says "quizás" ("perhaps") the class giggles because it sounds a lot like "kiss-ass." 
The teacher, SENOR GUTIERREZ, a rotund 50, bad comb-over and khakis up to his naval, stands off to the side, quickly picking up on Ronnie's excessive and increasingly dramatic use of the word. 
13   CONTINUED:                                                      13 
PARKER (CONT'D) a sixty-foot radius from this guy here. 
Parker points to a big black box (the CENTRAL TRACKING UNIT) on the kitchen counter. 
PARKER (CONT'D) He's like a modem. He gets a constant signal from Mr. Bracelet that he sends through your phone line to the monitoring station downtown. So they know where you are, where you've been and what you're thinkin' 25/7. 
JULIE What if he accidentally goes beyond -- 
PARKER (anticipating; re: red light on bracelet) Red light flashes. Means you've got about ten seconds to get your butt back to green, or else -- 
KALE The execution squad shows up? 
PARKER And they don't bring blindfolds. It's also tamper proof and waterproof. So don't try sticking your foot in a bucket of water and hopping across the line. It won't work, and you'll look stupid. Now, I'll be checking up on you a lot. Here's my card -- You're set up to pay his incarceration fee, Ms. Brecht? 
JULIE Automatic withdrawal. (to Kale) Twelve bucks every day. 
PARKER (re: a booklet) Everything else is in the manual. (making her way out) Oh, except this -- House arrest might sound like a breeze, but trust me, I've seen all kinds of folks get a bit loopy before too long, some after just a day or two. So make sure you find lots of constructive things to keep yourself busy.

14   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER                                14 
Kales sits in his video game chair, wearing his X-box live headset, playing HALO 2 -- he's on the final "boss level." GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS BLARE over his stereo speakers. 
KALE (into headset as needed) Hobby, you read me? I said come around my left flank and draw his fire -- damn straight I'm trying to get you smoked, you've been hiding behind my ass the whole game -- 
The TV SCREEN suddenly GLITCHES. 
KALE (CONT'D) Hobby, Jet, you guys still there? 
The screen goes black. The XBOX LIVE LOGO APPEARS along with the words: SERVER ERROR. Kale throws the headset aside, makes sure all the wires are connected. Checks the TV screen. Same thing. 
Kale glares at the screen another beat, then gets up, wanders out of his room... 
15   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                               15 
Kale slowly heads down the stairs, rounds the corner into... 
16   INT. KALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                   16 
Kale runs into Julie who wears a black blouse and slacks, the required uniform of the steakhouse she works at. She's just thrown a couple of microwave dinners on the kitchen table. She's scrambling around, eating a couple bites, gathering her things... 
JULIE Dinner's on the table. I'm closing at the restaurant the next few nights. Could be some late ones, but hey... the extra tips couldn't hurt. 
Kale sits at the table, picks through his food. 
JULIE (CONT'D) (glancing around) Where's my apron... apron... 
She heads O.S. for a beat, comes back in with her apron and purse, sets them on the counter. Eyes her watch, sits at the table, takes a couple more quick bites. Then --

16   CONTINUED:                                                             16 
JULIE (CONT'D) You wanna talk about anything? 
KALE I got nothin'. 
JULIE Y'know, when we're finally free of all this legal stuff with the accident, the other families' lawyers... there might be a little insurance money left... maybe you should go back and see Dr. Phillips? 
KALE What, so he can tell me I'm ADD, have PTSD, and severe IAD? 
JULIE IAD? 
KALE (messing with bracelet) Freakin' irritated ankle disorder. 
Julie can't help but crack a little smile: 
JULIE Well, that one could've been avoided. 
Kale looks back up. He's not smiling. Whatever chance we had of a lighter conversation panning out here quickly fizzles. Another beat, then -- Julie pushes her chair back, heads to the counter, grabs her apron and purse. 
JULIE (CONT'D) (heading out) Do the dishes. (pleading) Please? 
Julie leaves. Kale glances around the kitchen.       A mess of dirty dishes, stacks of paper... screw that. 
17   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - LATER                                    17 
Kale, looking disheveled and very perplexed, now has his TV pulled out from the wall. He's behind it, meticulously checking and re-connecting all the wires and ethernet cable. Carefully studying the manual as he goes. 
He blows on the Halo 2 CD, wipes it down with his sweatshirt, gently puts it in the tray, giving us the idea this might not be his first attempt at this. 
(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso 
17   CONTINUED:                                                           17 
He powers up the Xbox, grabs a controller... so far, so good... he scrolls through the screens, a little hope returning... SERVER ERROR. 
Kale throws a mini-fit, slams the controller to the floor. Rips the controller cord out of the XBOX -- 
18   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING                               18 
KALE (CONT'D) What are you, mental? 
JULIE (a very stern tone) One more look at that kitchen and I will be. 
Julie picks up her keys and briefcase, pecks Kale on the forehead, leaves. 
JULIE (O.S.) (CONT'D) You heard what I said about the lawyer? 
KALE Yes! 
25   INT. LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY - LATER                                    25 
Kale furiously stuffs clothes in the washer, blindly cranks the knob, presses start. 
26   INT. KITCHEN - DAY - LATER                                         26 
Kale SHOVELS dishes and glasses into the dishwasher, breaking a couple as he goes. He pours half the box of Cascade in the dispenser, kicks the door up and closed, cranks the knob. 
27   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER                                  27 
Kale sits on his bed, staring into space. He eyes the clock. Tick tick tick... We hear KIDS PLAYING IN THE STREET O.S. 
Kale glances out the window. 
HIS POV - Kids on bikes, NEIGHBORS out on walks... ahh... the sights and sounds of summer... And Kale's not invited. He glares down at his ankle bracelet. It glares back. 
28   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER                                  28 
Kale sits on the floor as he spreads a line of Elmer's glue across the bottom of a Twinkie. He's just completed the first couple of floors of what will be... TWINKIE TOWER. 
29   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY                                          29 
Kale, on cell, sits in his video game chair painting his toe nails. 
KALE (into phone as needed) Dammit, Ronnie, I'm losing my mind. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso 
29   CONTINUED:                                                           29 
KALE (CONT'D) Give me some details, what's happening out there? 
RONNIE (V.O.) (phone filter; party sounds in the b.g.) Dude, the chicks here in Oahu rock the houusse! Oh my god, this one is totally showing me her kite board. Belay that, she wasn't pointing at me. Look, Kale, I've gotta hop -- 
KALE Wait, Ronnie -- Hello? 
Kale tosses the phone and the nail polish aside. Sits there in silence for a beat. Then eyes a racketball on the floor. Picks it up. Starts mindlessly bouncing it against the wall... and keeps bouncing it... and keeps bouncing it... 
HARD CUT TO: 
30   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER                                    30 
Kale reclines in his chair, now FURIOUSLY SWATTING the racketball against the wall -- with a racket. We PULL BACK to reveal SCUFF MARKS on the walls and CEILING where Kale has figured out the exact points to hit it allowing him to bounce the ball off multiple walls and return it perfectly to his hand. He SWATS it... and SWATS it... 
31   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - STILL LATER                              31 
Kale's passed out in his chair, the racket still in his hand. He's about to fall out of the chair when a loud BANG O.S. JOLTS him awake. 
32   INT. 2ND FLOOR HALLWAY/WINDOW - DAY - SECONDS LATER                  32 
Kale goes to the window, tilts his head, trying to see where the noise is coming from. 
KALE'S POV - He's able to make out some bits of movement next door, but his VIEW is OBSTRUCTED by the architecture of his house. 
Kale steps back from the window, studies it a beat -- then opens it, slowly sticks his head out. 
HIS   POV - A U-HAUL TRUCK comes into view. It's backed into the   driveway next door. ALAN NORRIS, 43, appears from inside the   truck's cab, carrying a moving box. He hands it down to his   wife, BONNIE, 42, who walks back in the house. 
(CONTINUED)     D.J. Caruso 
32   CONTINUED:                                                             32 
Kale's about to pull his head in when another PERSON comes out of the moving truck. She's carrying a box that's obscuring her face as she carefully negotiates the incline of the moving truck's ramp. 
But her blonde hair and perfect legs look to be about 17. We'll soon know her as ASHLEY, the Norris' daughter. 
She reaches the end of the ramp. Bends over to retrieve another smaller box, her back and ass to Kale who stares in utter disbelief. Ashley stacks the boxes, picks them up and heads into the house, her face still a mystery. 
Kale watches her go.   Mesmerized. Suddenly, the DOORBELL RINGS O.S. Kale snaps to, yanks his head back in -- and KERBONGS it on the underside of the window. He drops to the floor. 
KALE GODDAMMIT! 
Kale staggers to his feet... 
33   INT. ENTRY HALL - DAY - SECONDS LATER                                  33 
More doorbell RINGING.       Kale heads down the stairs to the front door. 
KALE I'm coming!! 
Kale swings the door open to see -- A BURNING PAPER BAG on the welcome mat. 
34   EXT. KALE'S HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - DAY - CONTINUOUS                     34 
ON KALE'S FEET - entering frame, inching their way through the yard... 
ON THE BRACELET - The green light suddenly goes out, red light FLASHES. Kale's foot quickly steps back. GREEN LIGHT. A beat, then -- 
A SMILING GARDEN GNOME SLAMS DOWN INTO FRAME. 
WIDER - Kale ties kite string around the gnome's hat, then unspools it across the yard to a waiting croquet mallet already hammered into the ground. He pulls the string taut and ties it off. 
We PULL BACK to REVEAL Kale's emerging KITE STRING PERIMETER -- a crude SEMI-CIRCULAR ARC around the yard tied off at different points using makeshift "stakes" -- gnomes, mallets, shovels, screwdrivers... 
40   EXT. KALE'S FRONT YARD - DAY - SHORT TIME LATER                    40 
Same "BOUNDARY CONSTRUCTION" here. Kale shoves a screwdriver into the ground a few feet shy of his mailbox. He ties some string to it as he glances over to the other neighbors' (the PILCH's) yard, sees their black Labra-doodle watching him. 
KALE Hey doggie, come here... 
The dog trots toward Kale. It almost reaches his outstretched hand when it suddenly gets ZAPPED by the underground electric fence. It YELPS away. Spins back around, sits and stares. 
KALE (CONT'D) (re: his ankle bracelet) Hey, you and me both. 
OVER KALE'S SHOULDER IN THE B.G. - ASHLEY 
lifts more boxes from the back of their station wagon. She sets them on the drive, SLAMS the liftgate. Kale turns around. Ashley throws him a quick glance, then heads around the back of her house. Kale stares after her. 
41   INT. 2ND FL HALL OUTSIDE DAD'S OFFICE - DAY                        41 
CU - The doorknob. Kale's hand enters frame, slowly turns it. Click. Kale pushes. 
D.J. Caruso 
42   INT. DAD'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS                             42 
Kale stands in the doorway. He takes a moment, considering what he's about to do. Then -- HIS FOOT steps inside. He goes to the window, gently pulls the blind up to reveal the 
BACK OF ASHLEY'S HOUSE 
He peers down, sees Ashley and her mom standing by the swimming pool. Ashley disappears through the back door. 
Kale tilts his head up, curiously gazing through the pair of OPEN WINDOWS on the SECOND FLOOR of Ashley's house. 
HIS POV - ASHLEY'S BEDROOM 
Unmade bed, stacks of open moving boxes, poster frames waiting to be hung... Kale squints, steps closer. 
ASHLEY 
enters the room. Digging clothes from boxes, stuffing them in her dresser, then -- she pulls her hair back, yanks off her t-shirt, revealing a black bra. 
ON KALE - he continues to watch as Ashley digs a towel out of a moving box, and, with her back to us, pulls off the bra and disappears into the bathroom. Off Kale -- 
CUT TO: 
43   INT. KALE'S HOUSE - ENTRY HALL - DAY                             43 
The front door swings open to reveal Ronnie, DV camera in hand. He's wearing aviator shades, half a dozen leis and a hawaiian shirt. 
RONNIE (hula dancing) Aloooha Senor Ka-- Dude, you look like hell. 
REVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL KALE - now with a patchy stubble, wearing a bathrobe and a SHRUNKEN t-shirt that used to be white but is now LIGHT PINK. He holds his bat in one hand, quart of Haagen Dazs in the other. He smiles, hugs Ronnie. Tight -- and not letting go -- 
44   INT. 2ND FL HALLWAY/WINDOW - DAY - MOMENTS LATER                 44 
Kale leads Ronnie up the stairs and to the window... 
RONNIE Seriously man, you need some sun. (MORE)

44   CONTINUED:                                                           44 
RONNIE (CONT'D) (re: DV cam) Hey, I've gotta show you this.    Maui chicks rule. 
KALE (anxious) I've got something to show you, too. (then; slightly crazed) I mean... there's such structure to it, so many layers, but it's invisible if you're not looking close enough... 
RONNIE What are you talking about? 
KALE The world right outside the window. 
Kale gestures out the window.       Ronnie looks out. They peer down to the Pilch's backyard.       A Ford Escort is in the drive. Besides that, all's quiet. 
RONNIE -- Fascinating. 
KALE (eyeing his watch) Just wait... and... (then) Three... two... one... dog... 
The Pilch's dog darts out the back door -- then -- 
KALE (CONT'D) ...Mrs. Pilch... saying goodbye to Lonnie... 
RONNIE Husband? 
KALE (shaking a "no") Maid. 
Over the above, Mrs. Pilch, wearing an unflattering tennis skirt, exits the house. The dog hops around her as she waves back to her heavy set, male maid, LONNIE, 35. 
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley sits on the roof leaning against her closed window. She's reading Lolita. 
RONNIE (O.S.) So you don't know what year the Mustang is? 
REVEAL RONNIE - sitting at dad's computer looking at the FBI'S OFFICIAL WEBSITE. 
KALE (now flipping through magazine) '65 or '66, couldn't tell. 
RONNIE Check this out. The feds think your missing girl might be related to three murders in Austin. All redheads. 
Kale processes that as we suddenly hear a car door SLAM O.S. 
BINOCULAR POV - Kale TILTS DOWN to see Ashley's mom backing out the driveway. Kale TILTS UP to Ashley's window -- Ashley ducks back inside her room, disappears. 
KALE Movement.

BINOCULAR POV - Kale TILTS DOWN to the pool, sees Ashley emerging from the house with a towel that she throws on the lounge chair. 
KALE (CONT'D) Better late than never. 
Ronnie joins Kale at the window. 
THEIR POV - Ashley flips her sandals off one at a time, pulls her tank off revealing her bronzed back and bikini top. 
RONNIE Dude... 
Ashley slinks out of her shorts revealing a "near-thong" bikini this time. 
RONNIE (CONT'D) DUDE!! 
KALE (re: bikini) That's definitely new. 
Ashley crouches down, runs her fingers through the water. 
RONNIE Oh, it's so warm, baby... 
Ashley cups her hands, scoops a handful of water from the pool, splashes her face... runs her hands through her hair... She stands, takes a deep breath, holds it -- then exhales... 
RONNIE (CONT'D) Cleansing breath... 
Ashley stretches her arms high above her head. 
RONNIE (CONT'D) Concentrate now. This is for the gold. 
Ronnie grabs the binoculars from Kale, puts them to his eyes, moves closer to the window -- but his zoomed-in vision causes him to underestimate the distance -- THWUMP. The end of the binoculars HIT THE WINDOW just as Ashley dives into the pool -- Ronnie and Kale hit the deck as we hear the splash O.S. 
KALE Jackass! 
RONNIE Dude, there's no way she heard that.

KALE Dick, my deaf aunt in Omaha heard that. 
Kale grabs the binoculars from Ronnie. 
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley's underwater at the far end of the pool. She tucks and pushes off the wall, swims back... 
RONNIE (peering out) She's got great lung capacity. 
ON ASHLEY - She suddenly surfaces, hoists herself from the water. She spins and sits on the ledge, rings the water from her hair. But she suddenly stops -- and shifts her GAZE UP toward Kale and Ronnie! 
KALE (pulling Ronnie down) I think she saw me -- 
RONNIE There's no way -- 
Ronnie grabs the binoculars back. 
RONNIE (CONT'D) (re: Ashley O.S.) Okay, maybe she did. 
KALE Seriously? 
Kale peeks out -- 
THEIR POV - Ashley's slipping back into her shorts and tank top. She heads to the back door, tries the knob. Locked. Over this, Ronnie turns to Kale: 
RONNIE Her swims always that short? 
KALE (growing concern) No, she usually takes her time -- 
They turn back.     Ashley's gone. 
RONNIE Now where is she? 
The DOORBELL RINGS.       Kale and Ronnie freeze.   Then -- 
(CONTINUED)     D.J. Caruso 
Ashley picks up the binoculars from the window sill, peers outside. 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) Anything interesting out there? 
Kale and Ronnie trade looks. Ashley turns around, binoculars still raised, aiming them like a gun at Kale. 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) Are you spying on the neighbors, Kale? 
Kale freezes. 
RONNIE (stepping in) Actually, he is. 
Kale's eyes widen in panic. 
RONNIE (CONT'D) See, he has this neighbor -- who I guess by definition would also be your neighbor -- who may, in point of fact, be a cold-blooded killer. 
ASHLEY Is that so. 
Ronnie points out the window to Giles' house. 
RONNIE Exhibit A, Robert Giles.

ASHLEY Yeah, I've seen him.   So? 
KALE So you hear about that missing girl from Madison? 
ASHLEY (realizing; then pointing out to Giles') What, you think he -- 
KALE He drives a car like the one she was seen in. 
RONNIE Black Mustang. 
KALE 60's era Mustang. 
ASHLEY Gee, that really narrows it down. 
KALE They said it was dented.     His has a bashed-in fender. 
ASHLEY (re: binoculars) So this is why -- you're -- 
Suddenly seeing something O.S., Kale RIPS the binoculars out of Ashley's hand, goes to the window. 
RONNIE What? 
BINOCULAR POV - Giles pulls the Silver Toyota out of the garage and out the driveway. 
Ashley suddenly grabs the binoculars from Kale, peers out. 
KALE Hey -- 
ASHLEY So that's the infamous black mustang, huh? 
KALE Yeah --

ASHLEY The one with no dent? 
KALE (grabbing the binocs) What? 
BINOCULAR POV - Sure enough, the Mustang NO LONGER HAS A BASHED-IN FENDER. The garage door starts to close -- 
KALE (CONT'D) How'd he fix it so fast -- 
ASHLEY Because it was never there in the first place? 
Kale eyes Ashley. Shit, could he have imagined it?       Ashley playfully grabs the binoculars back from Kale. 
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley catches a glimpse of a faded TEXAS LONGHORNS BUMPER STICKER. 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) Sorry guys, no bashed-in fender, just a Longhorns bumper sticker. 
KALE (grabbing the binocs) You serious? (then to Ronnie) She's right. 
THEIR POV - Giles' garage door finally SLAMS CLOSED. 
KALE (CONT'D) (off Ashley's questioning look) They think it might be linked to some murders in Texas two years ago. 
RONNIE Austin, Texas. Texas Longhorns. 
Kale and Ronnie eye Ashley as if to say "see?"      Ashley eyes them another beat -- then: 
ASHLEY Okay, fine, stakeout. (grabs binoculars) Who's on my shift? 
Off Kale and Ronnie, their dreams realized --

ASHLEY Something like that. (eyeing the bracelet) So... what're your issues, Kale? 
Kale hesitates. We see in his eyes that he's flashing to the past... "going there..." There's an uneasy beat as Ashley picks up on it: 
Then -- HEADLIGHTS APPEAR OUTSIDE. Kale quickly turns away from Ashley, pulls one of the DV Cams off its tri-pod, flips out the three-inch LCD SCREEN. 
KALE That's him. 
DV CAM POV - Giles' silver Toyota pulls in the driveway. Stops. Engine and headlights turn off. 
ASHLEY Another car -- 
DV CAM POV - Kale ZOOMS IN. The GRAINY IMAGE finally steadies to reveal a SECOND CAR pulling in behind Giles. A thirty- something attractive WOMAN -- a REDHEAD -- is at the wheel. She pulls in next to Giles' car. 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) You seen her before? 
KALE No. 
DV CAM POV - Giles gets out.      Wearing a suit, no tie. 
ASHLEY (re: Giles) Cute for a killer. 
Giles goes to the woman's car, opens her door. 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) Who said chivalry's dead? 
The woman gets out, wearing a black cocktail dress. 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) There's a club girl for you. 
KALE How do you know?

ASHLEY Bright green bracelet's "The Pyramids," purple's "Club 360," the big black stamp's from "Flavor." 
DV CAM POV - Kale ZOOMS in on the woman's wrist and hand. Sure enough, she's wearing both a green and a purple bracelet, and has a black stamp blotch on her hand. 
KALE (over the above) Missing girl was seen at a club. Didn't say which one though... (then aside to Ashley) Your I.D. must be pretty good. 
ASHLEY (with a smile) I don't need one. 
They turn back to the window, watch as Giles escorts the woman to the house, shows her in. A light comes on inside. 
DV CAM POV - Kale ZOOMS IN on one of the living room windows, spots the woman moving around inside, looking at artwork... she sits on the sofa as Giles enters with two glasses and a bottle of wine. He sits down, pours the wine. They toast, take sips. Giles moves in for a kiss -- 
KALE He's going in. 
DV CAM POV - The woman shies away from Giles, stands from the sofa. 
ASHLEY Denied... 
They watch as the woman gets up, moves to the center of the room, and starts to get a little groove on... 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) (been there, done that) Oh no, he put on music... 
DV CAM POV - Giles watches the woman as she seductively moves her body to the music we're not hearing. 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) Oh, c'mon, Giles, all she wants to do is dance.

KALE What do you think they're listening to? 
ASHLEY Could be radio. See if you can find the station. 
Kale sets the camera down, turns on his receiver. As he toggles through radio stations -- Rock, Alternative... 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) (watching the woman & Giles) No... no... 
Kale flips to an easy listening R & B station playing Lou Rawls "You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine." 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) Stop. 
BINOCULAR POV - Ashley watches as Giles takes the woman's hand and dances with her. Their rhythm fits the music perfectly. 
ON RONNIE - he stirs on the bed, still asleep. 
RONNIE (eyes closed; grinning re: music) Hmmm... 
Ashley and Kale eye Ronnie for a beat.     Then turn back to the window. 
DV CAM POV - Kale pans back to the woman and Giles. They're really dancing close now. Kale's and Ashley's eyes shift to each other, then quickly flick away. A beat. Then -- Ashley raises the binoculars, faces back toward Giles' with: 
ASHLEY Now's the time to bust your move. 
RONNIE (V.O.) Uh-huh. 
KALE Dude, something is going on over there. What if he killed her, too? 
RONNIE (V.O.) Then call your friends at the police department. 
A DOOR suddenly SLAMS O.S. 
KALE Wait -- 
RONNIE (V.O.) What? 
KALE A door just slammed. 
RONNIE (V.O.) (in his best sinister "Scream" voice) That's right, Kale, and now I'm coming up to slash your guts out, you little bastard! 
KALE Asshole, I'm serious. 
RONNIE (V.O.) I'm not and I'm hanging up.

KALE Just -- wait -- wait till I check the hall -- 
This as Kale grabs his bat, slowly approaches his door. Ronnie yawns, starts snoring. Kale's hand is about to grab the knob -- 
RONNIE (V.O.) BOO! 
KALE Goddamn you!! 
Kale flips the phone closed, throws it to the bed. He turns back to the door just as IT SUDDENLY PUSHES OPEN, SMACKING KALE IN THE FOREHEAD! Kale STUMBLES BACK, screams, raises the bat. 
JULIE Kale, Kale, it's me!! 
Kale doesn't immediately drop the bat as he focuses on Julie, dressed in her serving uniform, barely visible in the darkness. She flips the light on. 
KALE No, don't! 
JULIE What's going on, who were you talking to?! 
KALE Ronnie -- just Ronnie. 
Kale falls back to the bed. 
KALE (CONT'D) I heard the door -- 
JULIE I'm sorry, the wind caught it -- 
KALE Fine.   Good.     Okay -- 
JULIE Okay then, so... (catching her breath; then) You want anything from the grocery? I'm going in the morning.

KALE Anything caffeinated. 
Kale turns back on his side. Julie eyes him a long beat. What to say... she flips off the light, then -- pulls the door closed. 
ON KALE - eyes wide open, heart racing.    He's gonna need that caffeine in the morning. 
63   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING                             63 
A groggy Kale tugs on the blind, cautiously raises it -- 
KALE'S POV - GILES' DRIVEWAY - The silver Toyota's gone. The woman's car is still there. 
64   INT. ENTRY HALL - LATE THE NEXT MORNING                            64 
Kale saunters down the stairs.... 
65   INT. KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS                                    65 
Kale enters, notices a few full grocery bags on the counter and the coffee maker brewing. He opens the fridge, sees a new Mountain Dew twelve-pack. He cracks open the carton, pulls out a can, closes the fridge door revealing 
GILES - IN THE FLESH, IN KALE'S KITCHEN. 
Kale JUMPS, drops the can.    It rolls to Giles' feet. 
GILES (picking up the can) Whoa, whoa, settle down, slow down. Robert Giles, your neighbor -- (gesturing outside) Behind you? 
Kale glares, breathing hard. Giles taps on the top of the dented soda can, hands it to Kale. Kale doesn't take it. Note: Giles' shirt should have BURNT ORANGE somewhere in it, either in the pattern, stripes, etc... 
KALE I know, how did you -- 
Giles puts the soda on the counter as Julie comes through the kitchen door carrying groceries. 
GILES (to Julie) Think I startled him.

Kale quickly grabs the jar of sugar from the counter and even thinks to grab a spoon from the drawer. He delivers it to Giles as Julie brings the coffee, sits at the table. 
GILES (CONT'D) Thanks, man. 
Kale turns to leave again. 
GILES (CONT'D) Oh, hey, Kale... (as Kale turns back) Nice to finally meet you. 
Off Kale -- 
ASHLEY (V.O.) (prelap) Oooh. That's creepy. 
66   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - DAY - LATER                                    66 
Ashley sits on the bed. She looks damned good, too.        Dolled up, lipstick. She's just heard the story from Kale. 
KALE I know, he's a total freak, right? 
ASHLEY And very vague... did he genuinely mean it was nice meeting you or was he sending you a "sinister message?" 
KALE Are you messing with me? 
ASHLEY Maybe a little. Did you even notice my hair? 
KALE So you think it's all a coincidence. We've got the car -- 
ASHLEY With the non dent dent -- 
KALE The bumper sticker, the argument, the staring contest -- And now he's showing up in my kitchen -- 
ASHLEY Why, because he slashed your mom's tire?

KALE Maybe. 
Ashley rolls her eyes. 
KALE (CONT'D) (pointing out window) Her car hasn't moved. 
ASHLEY It's called "the day after," Kale. Nobody moves after a night like that. 
KALE Well what if she's really "not moving?" What if she's tied in the dungeon with the other girl, starving to death -- 
ASHLEY (getting up) Then come up with a rescue plan and get back to me. 
KALE You're leaving? 
ASHLEY Have to.    Party. 
KALE Whose? 
ASHLEY Uh, mine? 
KALE How is that possible? 
ASHLEY Excuse me? 
KALE Well, I mean... Sorry, I just didn't think you knew anybody -- 
ASHLEY I don't, I didn't -- (off Kale's confusion) I met this girl earlier, Minnie Tyco?

ASHLEY (skipping that one) I told her my parents were outta town -- 
KALE And now the whole neighborhood's coming. 
ASHLEY Look, I'm stuck here. So I figured I can either shut myself in and keep hating it or... try to make the most of it. 
KALE Hey, I get it. You don't have to explain. 
ASHLEY Kale, you're welcome to come, but -- 
Kale looks at Ashley, realizes what she's referring to as he glances down to the ankle bracelet. 
KALE (with attitude) Well, I appreciate the thought. Really. 
ASHLEY (returning the tude) Glad to hear it. 
Ashley turns to leave. 
KALE It's funny, though. 
RONNIE (prelap) You want me to do what?

ON KALE - holding up a UNIVERSAL GARAGE DOOR REMOTE still in the package. 
Ashley and Ronnie are on the bed. Note: Kale is wearing the same clothes he was yesterday, the stubble coming back. Hair more disheveled, eyes a little puffier... 
KALE Phase one, steal his code from his opener. 
RONNIE There's more than one phase? 
KALE There's only two. Now look, his remote's in the glove compartment of his Toyota. All you have to do is pop it open and read me the switch settings. "On" or "off." 
RONNIE For the later purpose of doing what? Breaking in to his house? 
KALE No, not breaking in. We're just talking about having access to his garage so we can go in on our own time - when he's not there - to just... to get a closer look at the car, the bag -- 
RONNIE (to Ashley) All this sounds reasonable to you? 
ASHLEY I don't know about that, but -- 
KALE (re: universal remote) This is good up to thirteen digits -- 
RONNIE (realizing) How long have you been planning this?

GILES suddenly FIRES UP HIS LAWNMOWER O.S. 
KALE'S POV - Giles pushes the mower around the side of the house to the front yard. 
KALE Look, if we're gonna do this, it's gotta be now. He takes twenty-one minutes average to mow his front yard... you'll be hearing him the whole time... 
Ashley grabs the remote. 
ASHLEY I'll do it. 
RONNIE No. (beat; then grabbing the remote) It isn't safe. (getting up; macho) Let's do it.

KALE (into headset as needed) Yo, you set? 
RONNIE (V.O.) (phone filter as needed; suddenly sounding not so macho) I can't believe I'm doing this.

Kale presses "RECORD" on the tri-pod-mounted DV CAM. He peers back out the window. We hear Giles' lawnmower O.S. Both sides of his house are clear. 
KALE (CONT'D) Okay, Ron -- Green light. 
KALE'S POV - OUT HIS WINDOW - RONNIE - suddenly appears from the bottom of frame, keeping low as he darts to the fence. Ronnie turns, peers back up to Kale, gives him the thumbs up or down. 
KALE (CONT'D) You're all good. 
BINOCULAR POV - Ronnie draws a breath, then very ungracefully hops the fence and falls into Giles' yard out of sight. 
RONNIE (V.O.) Oww, shit -- 
KALE You okay -- 
RONNIE (V.O.) What do you think? 
BINOCULAR POV - Ronnie scrambles to his feet from behind the fence, darts to the driver's side door of Giles' Toyota. 
KALE Dude, glove compartment, other side. 
RONNIE (V.O.) Excuse me if I'm used to my mom's import. Can I just try this one while I'm here? 
BINOCULAR POV - Ronnie lifts up on the latch.        Locked. 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Shit. 
Ronnie tries the back door.        Locked. 
RONNIE (CONT'D) (in Korean) Shit. 
ASHLEY 
Heading up the driveway. We barely hear her introduce herself to Giles. Giles steps around to the front of the car, uneasily shakes her hand. 
KALE (CONT'D) Ronnie, you're good -- 
No answer. 
KALE (CONT'D) Ronnie? 
BINOCULAR POV - Kale TILTS BACK TO THE TOYOTA, sees Ronnie sneaking out the back seat door on the driver's side as Ashley distracts Giles, pointing up to the trees on the opposite side of the yard. Who knows what they're talking about. Bird-watching perhaps. Whatever it is, it's working. 
KALE (CONT'D) Ronnie, was that the whole code? Ronnie? 
BINOCULAR POV - Kale PANS BACK to Ronnie as he hops the fence back into Kale's yard. 
Kale TILTS BACK UP to Ashley and Giles in the driveway.

Over this, a breathless Ronnie stumbles into the bedroom, joins Kale at the window. 
KALE (CONT'D) Was that the whole code? 
RONNIE (pissed) Excuse me? 
KALE (serious) The code, did you get it? 
RONNIE You've gotta be kidding. 
Ronnie and Kale lock eyes for a tense beat.     Then: 
KALE (re: something O.S.) No way. 
KALE'S POV - THE CLUB GIRL Giles brought home the other night exits the back door and walks up to Ashley and Giles! 
RONNIE (stepping closer) Great, Kale. She lives. 
Kale and Ronnie watch as Ashley shakes hands with the club girl, then throws a quick surprised glance up to Kale and Ronnie. Giles' body language tells us he's ready for Ashley to leave. Ashley gets the hint, shakes his hand, heads back down the driveway and out of sight. 
Kale raises the binoculars again, then furiously grabs for his pad and pencil. 
BINOCULAR POV - The club girl gets in her car. Giles closes her door, watches as she backs out. Kale TILTS DOWN to her license plate, starts jotting down the number. 
RONNIE (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
KALE Getting her license number -- 
RONNIE Why? 
Kale doesn't answer, still trying to get the rest of the number as Ashley enters, eyes Ronnie who gestures to Kale.

ASHLEY Okay, case closed. 
RONNIE Try telling Inspector Clouseau that. Now he thinks he needs her license number. 
ASHLEY Why, Kale?   It's over. 
Kale's starting to get manic: 
KALE "Yeah, he seemed like such a normal guy. Sure he kept to himself, but he was always nice to me." That's what they all say. That's what all the neighbors always say -- after the fact. Only after they've caught the guy, after he's killed thirty people -- 
Ashley and Ronnie trade concerned looks. 
ASHLEY Okay, I think we all just need to take a breath. 
KALE (heading out) Fine, but what about the bumper sticker, there's still a girl missing, just... what's in the bag? (then from O.S.) Can anyone tell me that?

A SHAKY and grainy VIDEO IMAGE appears on Kale's computer screen. Kale picks up one of Ronnie's old walkie-talkies. 
KALE (into walkie talkie as needed) You read? 
RONNIE (V.O.) (walkie talkie filter as needed) Yeah, you got a signal? 
ON KALE'S COMPUTER SCREEN - Ronnie suddenly aims THE VIDEO CAMERA AT HIS FACE. 
KALE Got video, no audio. 
RONNIE (V.O.) Yeah, mic's on the fritz.    How am I looking? 
Kale picks up the binoculars. 
BINOCULAR POV - Giles' garage door is still open.     There's a light on at the opposite end of the house.

RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Rapidly approaching the back of Giles' Toyota. 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Garage -- 
RONNIE'S   DV CAM POV - Very shaky as Ronnie makes his way to the back   seat door -- he takes out a pen light, aims it at the door   as his hand enters frame, lifts up on the latch. The door   pops open. 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Bingo. 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We see Ronnie's hand feeling around the back seat floor of Giles' car. 
Kale's CALL WAITING suddenly BEEPS. He looks at the CALLER I.D: ASHLEY. Shit. He has to let it go.

RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I'm setting the camera on the trunk. 
KALE Try to get the plate number of the Mustang and check for dents -- 
RONNIE (V.O.) I'm checking the bag first. 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - Ronnie sets the camera on the trunk of the Mustang, aims it perfectly at the BLUE BAG sitting in the corner. We watch with Kale as Ronnie enters frame, crouched low, heading toward the bag. He raises the walkie talkie -- 
RONNIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) It does look like blood -- and hair -- 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We watch as Ronnie kneels down, starts to open the bag. But suddenly, the still POV suddenly STARTS TO SLOWLY, STEADILY TRACK TO THE LEFT -- And Kale realizes -- 
KALE The camera's sliding -- 
RONNIE'S DV CAM POV - We watch as Ronnie spins and grabs the camera. 
UNIFORM #2 It's open. 
KALE It was already open. 
Uniform #2 knocks on the door. Rings the bell. No answer. Uniform #2's about to knock again when a light comes on inside. After a beat -- Giles opens the door. Looking disheveled, in his bathrobe. 
GILES Uh, yes, can I help you, officer? 
UNIFORM #2 Sorry to wake you, sir, we have a young man here claiming a friend of his is in your house. Would you know anything about that? 
GILES (laughs) No, I certainly wouldn't. 
KALE You're a lying son of a bitch! 
Uniform #1 retrains Kale as another CRUISER rolls to a stop. Uniforms #3 & 4 hop out, head to Uniform #1 to assist. 
UNIFORM #1 Take it easy -- 
KALE He's in there, goddammit!   He's inside! He's lying! 
Uniform #1 pulls Kale back to the cruiser, opens the back door and pushes him down on the seat --

UNIFORM #1 Sir, calm down -- 
KALE Okay, but he's lying -- he has my friend, and he kidnapped that girl last week, he killed maybe three others, all redheads, they could be in a bag -- a big blue plastic bag -- in his garage -- my friend knew this -- (re: Giles) That's why he's covering -- he didn't just wake up five minutes ago -- 
Uniform #1 looks concerned as he steps away from Kale. 
UNIFORM #1 (to Uniform #3; re: Kale) Can you -- 
Uniform #3 nods as Uniform #1 heads back up to Giles and Uniform #2. 
KALE'S POV - Uniform #1 whispers something to Uniform #2. They turn back to Giles. 
UNIFORM #2 Sir, do you mind if we take a look inside? 
A beat. A couple more police cruisers roll to a stop. Curious NEIGHBORS are now gathering across the street. 
GILES Absolutely, be my guest. 
Giles ushers them through the door and follows them into the house. Giles turns, shoots a quick glance to Kale before closing the door. 
ON KALE - all he can do is wait. He shifts his gaze to the gathering neighbors. A few lock eyes with him, shake their heads. Kale turns back toward the house... 
TIME CUT TO: 
88   EXT. GILES' BACK YARD - GARAGE - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER             88 
ON THE GARAGE DOOR - as it slowly raises up. 
WIDER - The uniforms, standing with Kale, wait as the door opens all the way. 
(CONTINUED)      D.J. Caruso 
88   CONTINUED:                                                              88 
A light comes on inside. Giles and Uniform #1 come out the inner garage door as Uniform #2 Giles drags the BLUE BAG out from the garage. 
Sure enough, there's blood smears and visible strands of matted hair near the top. Uniform #2 unties the bag, pulls the sides away. Everyone gathers around, peers inside, then suddenly yank themselves back at the horrible STENCH emanating from within. 
Kale eyes Uniform #1 who gestures him to look.       Kale steps toward the bag. 
KALE'S POV - We peer into the bag to reveal the WIDE OPEN eyes of a dead -- DEER. 
GILES (to the cops) I hit it the other night. Thought I'd save a few steps and get it off the road myself. I was gonna bury it sooner, but it's been a helluva week -- 
KALE So why'd you have to have the car fixed in record time, huh? Because it was covered in her blood -- 
GILES (talking over him; re: Mustang) Because it's a classic, I got it out of storage for the auto show, I needed it in pristine condition. 
UNIFORM #2 It's one of the biggest in the world. (off Uniform #1) The auto show. 
All eyes on Kale.    He slumps.   Giles has an answer for everything. 
UNIFORM #1 I think we're done here.   Sorry for the intrusion, sir. 
GILES Please, I understand. 
As the Uniforms lead Kale back down the driveway...

KALE (quietly; drained) So where's my friend, then? Can anyone tell me that? Does anyone believe me?! 
Kale looks over, sees PARKER, standing with JULIE whose eyes are filled with it all: anger, concern, sadness... 
JULIE Kale, come on -- 
Ronnie eyes Kale for a beat, wondering if he's serious. Then Kale cracks a smile. Ronnie cracks up. 
RONNIE But I do have to ask... what was in the bag? 
KALE (as if it were obvious) Dead deer. 
Kale and Ronnie lock eyes a beat. Then crack up again. Both laugh hysterically, slap happy as hell. 
RONNIE Naturally... (re: DV CAM) Hey, you want more evidence, detective? 
KALE I was watching, remember? 
Kale grabs the DV CAM from Ronnie -- Ronnie pulls it away. 
(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso 
90   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                    90 
RONNIE No, no, this is comedy, it deserves big screen treatment. 
Ronnie grabs some wires, starts hooking the camera up to Kale's TV. 
TIME CUT TO: 
91   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER                       91 
Kale and Ronnie watch the video of Ronnie's break-in.      They're cracking themselves up as we see -- 
ON THE TV - Ronnie's feet stumbling through the garage, the camera sliding away off the trunk of the Mustang, Ronnie diving for it. 
RONNIE Hey, I caught that. 
KALE So that's when the garage door started closing. 
RONNIE Yeah, he must have heard me. He came through the inside door -- (re: TV screen) This is where I ducked low and started... 
ON THE TV - Ronnie's feet start motoring across the concrete floor, racing through the doorway onto the hardwood floor... 
RONNIE (CONT'D) ...hauling aaaass... 
KALE That's great. 
ON THE TV - As before, we're mostly watching Ronnie's feet as they scamper around Giles' house. Then -- the camera falls away, slides across the floor toward that bookcase, its POV -- FOR A SPLIT SECOND - aiming UNDER THE BOOKCASE. 
RONNIE Dropped it. 
KALE Yeah, I lost signal -- 
ON THE TV - This we didn't see earlier -- The camera is quickly scooped up by Ronnie whose feet dart across Giles' entry hall floor toward the front door. 
(CONTINUED)     D.J. Caruso 
91   CONTINUED:                                                        91 
We see Ronnie's hand reach for the knob. 
RONNIE But I never leave evidence behind. 
ON THE TV - Ronnie's feet dart out Giles' front door and into the darkness of the yard... 
RONNIE (CONT'D) And that's about when you started yelling bloody murder and the shit hit the fan. 
The TV SCREEN goes black. 
RONNIE (CONT'D) (getting up) I'm starving. All that running around... 
Ronnie heads from the room. 
KALE (re: video) I'm gonna burn this. 
Kale gets up, heads to the camera. About to eject the tape, when a thought stops him. He pulls the camera off the TV, sits on the floor, presses "PLAY", scans back through the tape. 
ON THE TV - The same footage. Nothing glaring stands out. The camera falls from Ronnie's hand, slides to the bookcase. Ronnie quickly scoops the camera up, keeps running... 
KALE (CONT'D) You're not fooling me, Giles... 
Kale scans the tape back again, this time just to the point where Ronnie drops the camera. 
ON KALE - his eyes suddenly narrow -- did he see something? 
Kale scans back again. 
92   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                 92 
Ronnie enters, starts rummaging through the fridge, pulls a soda out, then goes for the cabinets. 
93   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                          93 
ON THE TV - just as the camera slides to a stop at the bookcase and aims underneath it, Kale FREEZES THE IMAGE. Dark, grainy. 
(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso 
93   CONTINUED:                                                            93 
Giles drags Kale into... 
101   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                              101 
... To reveal a bruised but conscious JULIE tied to the chair, her arms wrapped behind it! Kale's eyes widen with rage as he pulls free of Giles, drops to the floor, tries to roll away. But Giles grabs him back up, gets in his face -- 
GILES If you don't stop fighting me, I will gut her like a fish. 
Kale glares as Giles drags him into the... 
102   ENTRY HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                    102 
...And pulls him up the stairs... 
103   INT. KALE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - SECONDS LATER                        103 
Giles SLAMS Kale down in his desk chair. Giles eyes the DV CAM sitting on the TV. The tape slot's open. 
GILES So where's the tape? 
Kale mumbles a muffled "FUCK YOU" under the duct tape. 
GILES (CONT'D) You're right, I'll find it later. 
(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso 
103   CONTINUED:                                                           103 
Giles sits on Kale's bed. Eyes the book on serial killers. He picks it up, flips through it. 
GILES (CONT'D) It's funny, I hear a lot of authors say their first books were easy, it's the second one that's really hard. Wonder if your dad thought that. (off Kale's glare) See with me, it's the opposite. The very first one was... (sickly reminiscing) ...Very difficult... she was very beautiful... fragile... a lot of promise... the others in Texas were flings, low class... Patty Walsh had potential, but so did Amy. You saw her, right? When you were watching me? You should feel good, Kale, you guys saved her life. I was headed in to kill her when your girlfriend showed up. So, you're a hero, Kale. Savor the moment. (tosses the book) You have Microsoft Word? (off Kale's questioning look; re: computer) Turn it on. 
Kale doesn't move.    Giles raises the bat: 
GILES (CONT'D) I can type, you know. 
Kale turns to the computer, lifts his taped wrists to the keyboard. 
GILES (CONT'D) "Dear Ashley... I killed Ronnie and my mom because... (re: Kale not typing) What's wrong? Hey, you're the one who couldn't leave me alone. Truthfully, I'm sick of covering my tracks. You think I like spending my spare time looking over my shoulder for people like you? Word of advice, if you ever need to hurt someone, think everything through. Because you do get a taste for it, don't you? (MORE) 
(CONTINUED)   D.J. Caruso 
103   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                   103 
GILES (CONT'D) But damned if people aren't just waiting to stand in your way... cops, reporters, determined relatives, nosy fucking neighbors... next thing you know, you're on tilt, you can't think straight, you're clocking your teacher in front of the whole class, me... I'm hitting a damned deer... Man, that was some shitty luck. (then) Anyway, it's pretty clear how we've gotta clean this up. The irony is, you've done all the hard stuff. Whaddaya think: "Troubled youth finally snapped." Maybe because he was jealous of his girlfriend, or maybe he just couldn't deal with the guilt from not saving daddy. (off Kale) Hey, you Googled me. 
Giles steps away, turns back to the bed as Kale suddenly does SNAP. He leans forward, grabs the LCD computer monitor with his taped wrists, stands, whirls around, and HURLS it at GILES, SMACKING HIM on the side of his head -- a one in a hundred shot! Giles goes down. 
But the forward momentum of Kale's throw combined with his taped ankles causes him to lose his balance. Kale falls to the floor, scrambles for the BASEBALL BAT just inches away -- 
GILES 
staggers to his feet and charges Kale. Kale grabs the bat, rolls around and swings up at Giles, WHACKING HIM IN THE CHEST. Giles doubles over as Kale frantically plants the bat on the floor, using it as a "cane" to pull himself back to his feet. He HOPS toward Giles, raises the bat, swings it, but Giles anticipates, grabs the bat, pulls it forward, and REVERSE JABS KALE in the face! Kale staggers back, but somehow keeps his balance and the bat. He spins around, hops to the door into... 
104   INT. 2ND FL HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                            104 
Kale rounds the corner and runs smack into ASHLEY.   The collision sends Kale back to the floor. 
ASHLEY KALE -- 
Ashley leans down to Kale. Kale gestures with his eyes and head: BEHIND YOU! Ashley gets the message, whirls around just as Giles GRABS HER. Ashley SCREAMS and knees Giles. 
(CONTINUED)     D.J. Caruso 
104   CONTINUED:                                                        104 
He drops her to the floor. Ashley scrambles for Kale, helps him to his feet, pulls Kale back down the hall to... 
105   INT. DAD'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                            105 
Ashley shoves Kale inside as she spins back, SLAMS the office door in Giles' face, locks it. Giles BANGS on the door. 
Ashley goes to Kale, RIPS the duct tape off his mouth.   Kale SCREAMS in PAIN as Ashley heads for the desk phone. 
KALE It's dead. 
Ashley grabs a pair of scissors off dad's desk, cuts Kale's ankles and hands free. Kale reaches down to the ankle bracelet, furiously tugs at it. 
ASHLEY Let me try -- 
Ashley moves in, tries to cut it loose with the scissors as Giles suddenly SLAMS SOMETHING against the door, trying to break it down! 
ASHLEY (CONT'D) Where's your mom -- 
KALE (tugging on bracelet) Living room -- tied up -- he got Ronnie -- in the kitchen -- (then; re: bracelet) GODDAMN YOU!! 
ASHLEY (giving up with scissors) Okay, just -- I'll get your mom, you figure out a way to call the cops -- 
KALE No, I've gotta get her -- 
ASHLEY Kale, you've gotta get outside, get over the boundary -- do you hear me? 
KALE (beat; then; an idea sparking) Okay, but -- just follow my lead -- we're gonna need stuff -- 
CU - Kale cringes from the pain as Giles, now right behind him, wraps the SPEAKER WIRE around Kale's NECK and pulls. Kale grabs for it as Giles chokes the life out of him. Kale only has one chance. He reaches behind his leg, grabs the embedded letter opener, RIPS it away, twirls it in his hand and shoves it back into Giles' stomach! 
Giles recoils as Kale flings himself away from the choke- hold, falls back to the roof, rolls down and PLUMMETS to -- 
110   EXT. GARAGE ROOF - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                 110 
Kale hits HARD, the wind knocked out of him. He looks over, sees his racketball racket lying there. He grabs it, looks back up.

110   CONTINUED:                                                           110 
KALE'S POV - Giles stands on the upper roof, smiles as he brings up the letter opener. 
Kale's eyes widen. He pulls himself to his feet, and sidearms the racket up at Giles. The racket spins through the air like a boomerang and miraculously smacks Giles in the hand, knocking the letter opener away! 
WITH KALE - he whirls around, races toward the edge of the roof... and JUMPS. 
ANGLE: FOLLOWING BEHIND KALE IN MID AIR, WE CRANE UP AND OVER HIM PEERING DOWN TO REVEAL ASHLEY'S POOL! 
ON THE ANKLE BRACELET - it FLASHES RED. 
EXT. ASHLEY'S BACK YARD/SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Kale drops into the pool with a tremendous SPLASH!    He pulls himself to the surface, peers up -- 
KALE'S POV - the roof -- Giles is gone. 
Kale frantically swims to the edge, pulls himself out -- 
111   INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER                                 111 
The kitchen door slowly pushes open. After a beat, Kale quietly steps in, heavily armed with a swimming pool LEAF- SKIMMING NET. 
Another FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates the kitchen. Kale cautiously rounds the island, glances down: Ronnie's gone. He glances to the block of butcher knives -- empty. 
Kale grabs a couple of table knives from the kitchen drawer, opts to keep the leaf-skimming net as he makes his way out of the kitchen and into... 
112   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                 112 
Breathing hard, Kale glances around, up the stairs --    No sign of Giles. He rounds the corner into... 
113   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                113 
Julie's GONE. Kale's eyes widen. He turns around     as ASHLEY suddenly jumps up from behind the sofa brandishing   a BUTCHER KNIFE! She exhales in relief at the sight of Kale    who rounds the back of the couch, sees Ronnie's body lying on   the floor next to the entire set of butcher knives. 
KALE Where's my mom?

ASHLEY She went upstairs for you -- where's Giles? 
KALE I don't know -- the cops should be here any sec -- 
The doorbell RINGS. Kale and Ashley whip their heads to the door. Kale throws a troubled glance out the window -- 
ASHLEY What's wrong? 
KALE No flashing lights -- stay here -- 
Kale trades Ashley the net for the butcher knife.     We then FOLLOW KALE into... 
114   INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS                                114 
Still no sign of Giles -- Kale turns back to Ashley, then heads to the front door -- 
PEEPHOLE POV - Parker. 
Kale swings the door open. 
PARKER Kale, what's going on now? 
KALE Parker, where's the cavalry?! 
PARKER I told 'em don't bother, you were my responsibility -- 
KALE Parker, you need to get them here right now -- Giles is -- 
GILES (O.S.) Evening. 
Parker turns to see Giles casually walking up the front steps. 
KALE PARKER LOOK OUT, HE'S THE -- 
As Parker turns, Giles suddenly GRABS HER, spins her around and TWISTS HER NECK. Parker drops forward into the entry hall.

114   CONTINUED:                                                         114 
Kale stumbles back inside the door, tries to SLAM it closed, but Giles overpowers Kale, shoves the door open, knocking Kale to the floor. The butcher knife slides away under a table.

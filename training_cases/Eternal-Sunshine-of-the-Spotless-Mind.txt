Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (2003) by Charlie Kaufman. 
INT. PUBLISHING HOUSE RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
It's grand and modern.  Random House-Knopf-Taschen is etched on the wall in large gold letters.  An old woman enters carrying a tattered manuscript, maybe a thousand pages.  She seems haunted, hollow-eyed, sickly.  The young receptionist, dressed in a shiny, stretchy one-piece pantsuit, looks up. 
RECEPTIONIST Oh, hi. 
OLD WOMAN (apologetically) Hi, I was in the neighborhood and thought I'd see -- 
RECEPTIONIST I think he's in a conference. Unfortunately.  I'm really sorry. 
OLD WOMAN Would you just try him?  You never know. As long as I'm here.  You never know. 
RECEPTIONIST Of course.  Please have a seat. 
The old woman smiles and sits, the bulky manuscript on her lap.  She stares politely straight ahead. 
RECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) (quietly into headset) It's her -- I know, but couldn't you just -- Yes, I know, but -- I know, but she's old and it would be a nice -- Yes, sorry. (to old woman) I'm sorry, ma'am, he's not in right now. It's a crazy time of year for us. 
The receptionist gestures toward a Christmas tree in the corner.  Its ornaments are holograms. 
OLD WOMAN This book -- It's essential that people read it because -- (gravely, patting the manuscript) -- It's the truth.  And only I know it. 
RECEPTIONIST (nodding sympathetically) Maybe after the holidays then. 
INT. TILED HALLWAY - DAY 
The old woman carries her manuscript haltingly down a subway hall.  She stops to catch her breath, then continues and passes several archway with letters printed above them.  When she arrives at one topped by an LL, she slips a card in a slot.  A plastic molded chair drops into the archway.  She sits in the chair; it rises. 
INT. TUBE -DAY 
The woman is still in the chair as it slips gracefully into a line of chairs shooting through a glass tube.  The other chairs are peopled with commuters.  We stay with the woman as she and the others travel over New York City in the tube. There are hundreds of these commuter tubes crisscrossing the skyline.  The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap. It's called: 
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind 
This serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes. Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank. 
INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY 
SUBTITLED: FIFTY YEARS EARLIER 
Every doctor's office waiting room: chairs against the wall, magazines on end tables, a sad-looking potted plant, generic seascape paintings on the walls.  The receptionist, Mary, 25, can be seen typing in the reception area.  Behind her are shelves and shelves of medical files.  The door opens and Clementine enters.  She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's decidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up. 
MARY May I help you? 
CLEMENTINE (approaching reception area) Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak.  Clementine Kruczynski. 
MARY Yes, please have a seat.  He'll be right with you. 
Clementine sits.  She looks tired, maybe hungover.  She picks up a magazine at random and thumbs without interest. 
INT. INNER OFFICE AREA - CONTINUOUS 
Mary pads down the hallway.  She knocks on a closed door. 
MIERZWIAK (O.S.) Yes? 
Mary opens the door, peeks in.  Howard Mierzwiak, 40's, professional, dry, sits behind his desk studying some papers. 
MARY Howard, your one o'clock. 
MIERZWIAK (not looking up) Thanks, Mary.  You can bring her in. 
She smiles and nods.  It's clear she's in love.  It's equally clear that Mierzwiak doesn't have a clue.  Mary turns to leave. 
MIERZWIAK (CONT'D) (looking up) Mary... 
MARY (turning back) Yes? 
MIERZWIAK Order me a pastrami for after? 
MARY Cole slaw, ice tea? 
MIERZWIAK (nodding) Thanks. 
MARY Welcome, Howard. 
She smiles and heads down the hall.  Stan, 30's, tall, spindly, and earnest in a lab coat pops out of a doorway. 
STAN Boo. 
MARY Hi. 
She glances back nervously at Mierzwiak's open door. 
STAN Barely seen you all morning, kiddo. 
Later: Joel looks out at the ocean. 
Later: Joel sits on a rock and pulls out a notebook.  He opens it and writes with a gloved hand. 
JOEL January 13th, 2006.  Today I skipped work and took the train out to Montauk. (thinks) It's cold. (thinks some more) The sky is gray. (thinks some more) I don't know what else to say.  Nothing happens.  Nothing changes.  I saw Naomi last night.  We had sex.  It was weird to fall into our old familiar sex life so easily.  Like no time has passed.  After two years apart suddenly we're talking about getting together again.  I guess that's good. 
He has no other thoughts.  He glances up, spots a female figure in the distance, walking in his direction.  She stands out against the gray in a fluorescent orange hooded sweatshirt.  It's Clementine.  He watches her for a bit, then as she nears, he goes back to his writing, or at least pretends to.  Once she passed, he watches her walk away.  She stops and stares out at the ocean.  Joel writes. 
JOEL (V.O.) (CONT'D) If I'm constitutionally incapable of making eye-contact with a woman I don't know.  I guess I'd better get back to Naomi. 
Later: Joel walks up near the beach houses closed for the season.  He peeks cautiously in a dark window. 
Later: Joel digs into the sand with a stick. 
INT. DINER - DAY 
It's a local tourist place, but off-season empty.  Joel sits in a booth and eats a grilled cheese sandwich and a bowl of tomato soup.  An elderly couple drink coffee at the counter. Clementine enters, looks around, takes off her hood.  Joel glances at her bright blue hair.  She picks an empty booth and sits.  Joel studies her discreetly.  The waitress approaches her with a coffee pot. 
WAITRESS Coffee? 
CLEMENTINE God, yes.  You've saved my life! 
The waitress pours the coffee. 
WAITRESS You know what you want yet? 
CLEMENTINE (laughing) Ain't that the question of the century. 
The waitress is not amused. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) You got grilled cheese and tomato soup? 
WAITRESS Yeah.  We're having a run on it. 
The waitress heads to the grill.  Clementine fishes in her bag, brings the coffee cup under the table for a moment, pours something in, then brings the cup back up. 
CLEMENTINE (calling) And some cream, please. 
Clementine looks around the place.  Her eyes meet Joel's before he is able to look away.  She smiles vaguely.  He looks embarrassed, then down at his journal.  Clementine pulls a book from her purse and starts to read.  Joel glances up, tries to see the cover.  It's blue.  He can't read the title. 
EXT. BEACH - DAY 
Joel stares out at the ocean.  Far down the beach Clementine stares at it, too.  Joel glances sideways at her then back at the ocean. 
EXT. MONTAUK TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Joel sits on the bench waiting for a train.  Clementine enters the platform, sees Joel, the only other person there. She waves, sort of goofily enthusiastic, playing as if they're old friends.  He waves back, embarrassed.  She takes a seat on a bench far down the platform.  Joel stares at his hands, pulls out his journal and tries to write in order to conceal his awkwardness. 
INT. TRAIN - A BIT LATER 
Joel sits at the far end of the empty car and watches the slowly passing desolate terrain.  After a moment the door between cars opens and Clementine enters.  Joel looks up. Clementine is not looking at him; she busies herself deciding where to sit.  She settles on a seat at the opposite end of the car.  Joel looks out the window.  He feels her watching him.  The train is picking up speed.  Finally: 
CLEMENTINE (calling over the rumble) Hi! 
Joel looks over. 
JOEL I'm sorry. 
CLEMENTINE Why? 
JOEL Why what? 
CLEMENTINE Why are you sorry?  I just said hi. 
JOEL No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so... 
She looks around the empty car. 
CLEMENTINE Really? 
JOEL (embarrassed) Well, I didn't want to assume. 
CLEMENTINE Aw, c'mon, live dangerously.  Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car. 
JOEL Anyway.  Sorry.  Hi. 
Clementine makes her way down the aisle towards Joel. 
CLEMENTINE It's okay if I sit closer?  So I don't have to scream.  Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. (pause) But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something. 
JOEL No, I mean, I don't know.  I can't really think of much to say probably. 
CLEMENTINE Oh.  So... 
She hesitates in the middle of the car, looks back where she came from. 
JOEL I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here.  I didn't mean to -- 
JOEL See, I wouldn't think that about you. 
CLEMENTINE (pissy) Why wouldn't you think that about me? 
JOEL Oh.  I don't know.  I was just... I don't know.  I was... You seemed nice, so -- 
CLEMENTINE Now I'm nice?  Don't you know any other adjectives?  There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish. 
JOEL Well, anyway... Sorry. 
They sit in silence for a while. 
CLEMENTINE I just don't think "nice" is a particularly interesting thing to be. 
The conductor enters the car. 
CONDUCTOR Tickets. 
Joel hands the conductor his ticket.  The conductor punches it and hands it back. 
CLEMENTINE What is nice, anyway?  I mean, besides an adjective?  I guess it can be an adverb, sort of. 
The conductor turns to Clementine.  She fishes in her bag. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) It doesn't reveal anything.  Nice is pandering.  Cowardly. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) And life is more interesting than that. Or should be.  Jesus God, I hope it is... someday. (to conductor) I know it's here. 
The conductor and Joel watch as she gets more agitated. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) I don't need nice.  I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me. 
JOEL Okay. 
CLEMENTINE Shit.  Shit.  I know it's here.  Hold on. 
She dumps the contents of the bag onto the seat and sifts frantically through.  Joel sees the book she was reading in the diner.  It's The Play by Stephen Dixon. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Damn it.  DAMN IT! (there it is) Oh.  Here. 
She hands the conductor the tickets, smiles sweetly.  He punches it, hands it back to her, and walks away. 
CONDUCTOR Next stop Southampton. 
The conductor heads into the next car.  Clementine shoves stuff back into her purse.  Her hands are a little shaky. She pulls a airline-sized bottle of alcohol from her pocket, opens it, and downs it.  Joel is watching all of this but pretending not to.  She looks out the window for a while. The train pulls into the station.  The doors open.  Nobody gets on.  The doors close.  The train pulls out. 
CLEMENTINE Joel?  It's Joel, right? 
JOEL Yes? 
CLEMENTINE I'm sorry I... yelled at you.  Was it yelling?  I can't really tell.  Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today. 
JOEL That's okay. 
CLEMENTINE (stares out window) My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice.  Right now, anyway.  I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like.  But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me.  That was nice of you. 
JOEL It's no problem.  Anyway, I have some stuff I need to -- 
CLEMENTINE Oh, okay.  Well, sure, I'll just... (stands, throws bag over shoulder) Take care, then. 
JOEL (pulling journal from briefcase) Probably see you at the book store. 
CLEMENTINE (heading toward other end of car) Unless I get that hair-color-naming job. 
Clementine sits and stares out the window. 
INT. TRAIN - LATER 
There are a few more people in the car now.  Clementine has inched a few seats closer to Joel.  She watches him.  His head is immersed in his journal. 
INT. TRAIN - LATER 
It's dark out.  The train is pretty crowded.  Joel stares out the window.  Clementine sits closer still to Joel, eyes him. 
EXT. TRAIN STATION - EVENING 
The doors open and Joel emerges along with others.  He heads to the parking lot, arrives at the car.  There's a big dented scrape along the driver's side.  He gets in. 
INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER 
Joel drives.  He passes Clementine walking.  She looks cold. He considers, slows, rolls down his window. 
JOEL Hi.  I could give you a ride if you need. 
CLEMENTINE No, that's okay.  Thanks, though. 
JOEL You're sure?  It's cold. 
CLEMENTINE Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation? 
JOEL I don't know. 
CLEMENTINE Me neither.  Oh, there's an inscription on the back. (takes it off the wall, reads:) The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued. 
JOEL Frost? 
CLEMENTINE (impressed) Yeah.  I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch.  His stuff seems strictly grade school to me.  But this made me cry for some reason.  Maybe because it is grade school.  Y'know? 
JOEL It's pretty. 
CLEMENTINE I miss grade school.  I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden.  When I went we called it elementary school.  But I like grade school better.  Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then.  Everyone wore hats.  Anyway, cheers! 
JOEL Cheers. 
They click glasses.  Clementine giggles and takes a big gulp of her drink.  Joel sips.  She plops down on the couch and pulls her boots off. 
CLEMENTINE God, that feels so fucking good.  Take yours off. 
JOEL I'm fine. 
CLEMENTINE Yeah?  Well, have a seat, anyway. 
Joel sits in a chair across the room.  Clementine finishes her drink. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Ready for another? 
JOEL No, I'm okay for now. 
She heads toward the kitchen with her glass. 
CLEMENTINE Well, I'm ready.  Put some music on. 
Joel crosses to the CD's and studies them. 
JOEL What do you want to hear? 
CLEMENTINE (O.S.) You pick it. 
JOEL You just say.  I'm not really -- 
CLEMENTINE (O.S.) I don't know!  I can't see them from here, Joel!  Just pick something good. 
Joel studies the unfamiliar CD's.  He picks up Bang On a Can performing Brian Eno's Music for Airports to look at. Clementine reenters with her drink. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Oh, excellent choice. 
She grabs it and sticks it in the CD player.  The music is dreamy and haunting and slow.  Clementine falls back onto the couch, closes her eyes and sips her drink. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Mmmmmmm.  Way to go, Joel.  You pick good. 
Joel sits down in his chair and drinks.  There's a silence, which seems fine to Clementine but makes Joel anxious. 
JOEL Well, I should probably get going. 
CLEMENTINE No, stay.  Just for a little while. (opens her eyes, brightly) Refill? 
JOEL No.  I -- 
CLEMENTINE I know a man who needs a refill. 
She grabs Joel's drink from his hand, takes it into the kitchen. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D) God bless alcohol, is what I say.  Where would I be without it.  Oh, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, maybe I don't want to think about that. 
She giggles.  Joel looks around the room again.  There are several potatoes dressed as women in beautiful handmade costumes: a nurse potato, a stripper potato, a schoolteacher potato, a housewife potato.  Clementine returns with Joel's drink and a refill for herself. 
JOEL Thanks. 
CLEMENTINE Drink up, young man.  It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant. 
Joel looks a little alarmed. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) I'm just kidding.  C'mon. 
She sits back on the couch, closes her eyes.  Joel watches her, looks at her breasts.  She opens her eyes, smiles drunkenly at him. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Y'know, I'm sort of psychic. 
JOEL Yeah? 
CLEMENTINE Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic.  She should know. Do you believe in that stuff? 
JOEL I don't know. 
CLEMENTINE Me neither.  But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know.  Maybe that's just coincidence.  Right?  Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it?  Y'know? 
Stan nods professionally. 
STAN Mr. Barish. 
JOEL How exactly is this going to work tonight? 
As Mierzwiak talks, the room colors start to fade, Mierzwiak's tone of voice is also affected; it becomes dry and monotonous. 
MIERZWIAK We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process --  By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared.  Like a dream upon waking. 
JOEL Is there any sort of risk of brain damage? 
MIERZWIAK Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking.  Nothing you'll miss. 
Joel looks quizzically at the eroding environment.  Suddenly he gets it. 
JOEL It's happening now!  I'm already in my brain. 
Mierzwiak looks at the fading room. 
MIERZWIAK Yes, I suppose you are. (back in his faded memory persona) So, let's get started -- If we want the procedure underway tonight, we have some work to do. 
Joel is sitting in a chair.  Electrodes connect him to some electronic machinery monitored by Stan.  Mierzwiak watches from the corner. 
STAN We use the articles you brought to create a map of Clementine in your brain. Tonight while you sleep we'll be able to trace the map and erase. 
JOEL But you're tracing and erasing now.  It's already started.  I'm home in my bed. 
Stan pulls a snow globe from one of Joel's bags, shows it to Joel.  The equipment registers Joel's reaction. 
STAN Very good. 
Stan pulls out a potato dressed as a Vegas showgirl.  Joel studies it.  The machines register his response. 
MIERZWIAK We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.  That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence in your home. 
Stan pulls out a coffee mug with a photo of Clementine printed on it.  Joel looks at the cup.  The machines record his reaction. 
STAN Good.  We're getting healthy read-outs. 
The room, Stan, and Mierzwiak are now vague and wispy. 
STAN'S VOICE Patrick, do me a favor -- 
Joel is watching Stan.  Stan is not speaking, yet his voice continues. 
STAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) -- and check the voltage levels, I'm not wiping as clean as I would like here. 
Joel looks up.  Stan's voice seems to be coming from above. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Joel lies on his back in fresh pajamas.  His eyes are closed and electrodes connect his head to several machines.  The machines are operated by Stan, now in grubby street clothes and in need of a shave, and by Patrick, dressed similarly. The monitor on one of the machines traces a myriad of light blips running like streams through an image of Joel's brain. Stan presses buttons and operates a joystick, aiming for the lines.  Patrick (who we saw earlier with Clementine at the bookstore) studies a meter on one of the machines. 
PATRICK The voltage looks fine. 
STAN Then check the connections. 
Patrick fiddles with some jacks. 
PATRICK Does that help? 
STAN Yeah, that looks better.  Thanks. 
INT. LAB ROOM - DAY 
The memory is becoming vague, characters' affects flat.  Stan pulls out a pile of loose-leaf pages.  Mierzwiak smiles. 
MIERZWIAK Ah, your journal.  This will be invaluable. 
STAN (reading) December 15th, 2004.  I met someone tonight.  Oh, Christ:  I don't know what to do.  Her name is Clementine and she's amazing.  So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive.  Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long. 
The scene is just a shell of itself as Stan rattles on. 
STAN'S VOICE I think we got this one.  Let's push on. 
Joel looks up at the ceiling. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Joel, snapped into a new memory, cries as he fills two large plastic garbage bags with mementos of his relationship with Clementine.  There are funny little gifts, wind-up toys, some potatoes dressed as women, some clothing Clementine has left there, some CD's.  He pulls a big clump of pages out of his loose-leaf journal and dumps them in the bag. 
He gets some clean loose-leaf paper and writes: 
December 15, 2004   Nothing much happened today.  I stayed home.  Naomi worked on her dissertation. 
The scene is fading as he continues to write. 
PHONE MACHINE VOICE You have no messages. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Joel enters, checks his phone machine: zero messages. 
INT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY 
Joel gets off the elevator, approaches Carmen, who is in conversation with someone else. 
JOEL Sorry, Carmen.  Any messages? 
Carmen shakes her head "no", goes back to her conversation. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Joel checks his machine: zero messages. 
VOICE-OVER That's it.  I'm just gonna-- 
Without a moment's hesitation, he dials the phone. 
VOICE-OVER (CONT'D) I'm gonna tell her I'm through playing games and -- 
RECORDED VOICE The number you have dialed has been disconnected. 
Joel's eyes bug. 
INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Joel sits across Rob and Carrie, mid-40's. 
JOEL Why would she do that? 
VAGUE RECORDED VOICE -- If you think you have reached this recording in error, please check your number and dial again. 
CARRIE I don't know, honey.  It's horrible. 
JOEL She's punishing me for being honest.  I should just go to her house. 
ROB I don't think you should go there, Joel. 
JOEL Yeah, I don't want to seem desperate. 
CARRIE Maybe you need to look at this as a sign to move on.  Just make a clean break. 
JOEL I don't know.  I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature! 
ROB Joel, look, the thing is -- 
CARRIE (agitated, interrupting) Joel, honey... We have to feed the dog. Would you just wait here?  Just a second. 
Joel nods, confused, as Rob and Carrie leave the room and close the door behind them.  Joel hears a hushed argument ensue in the hall.  He notices the dog asleep on the floor. He grabs a magazine off the coffee table, flips through it distractedly as he paces, puts it down, picks up another.  A subscription card falls to the floor.  He picks it up and is about to shove it back in the magazine when he sees it is not a subscription card at all.  It reads: 
Clementine Kruczynski has had Joel Barish erased from her memory.  Please never mention their relationship to her again.  Thank you. 
Lacuna Ltd. 610 11th Avenue, NY, NY 
Joel stares at the card, incredulous. 
Later: Rob and Carrie are now back in the room. 
CARRIE (CONT'D) You weren't supposed to see that. 
JOEL They can't erase memories.  It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax. 
CARRIE Sweetie, we called the company. 
Joel just stands there. 
Close-up of a vague dictionary page. 
VOICE-OVER Lacuna:  Noun.  A blank, a missing portion, especially in a manuscript. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Joel is on the phone pacing. 
CARRIE'S VOICE You can't tell her, Joel.  They explained that.  Like waking a sleepwalker.  It might have a devastating effect. 
INT. JOEL'S CAR - NIGHT 
Joel drives past vague local landmark. 
CARRIE'S VOICE Think about it: to be told you lived an existence of which you have no recollection. 
JOEL'S VOICE But what am I supposed to do? 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Joel looks at his dented car, looks at Clementine clomping off in the distance. 
INT. JOEL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Joel drives to catch up with Clementine.  He rolls down his window to talk to her. 
JOEL Let me drive you home. 
CLEMENTINE (without turning) Fuck you, Joel.  Faggot. 
JOEL Look at it out here.  It's falling apart. I'm erasing you.  And I'm happy. 
She keeps clomping. 
JOEL (CONT'D) You did it to me.  I can't believe you did this to me.  By morning you'll be gone.  Ha! 
He stops the car, gets out. 
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS 
It's a street you might see in a dream, more an impression of a quiet street than an actual one, with what little detail there is obscured in darkness.  Joel wanders it.  In the distance Clementine walks off, but as in an animated loop, she doesn't get any farther away.  It's lonely. 
PATRICK'S VOICE See, remember that girl?  The one we did last week?  The one with the potatoes? 
Joel looks up, startled. 
STAN'S VOICE Yeah, that's this guy's girlfriend.  Was. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Stan watches the screen.  Patrick paces, fidgets, looks at the unconscious Joel. 
PATRICK I gotta tell you something.  I kind of fell in love with her last night. 
STAN She was unconscious, Patrick. 
PATRICK She was beautiful.  So sweet and funky and voluptuous.  I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what. 
STAN Jesus, Patrick! 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
On the vague street Joel listens to Patrick and Stan. 
PATRICK'S VOICE I know.  It's not like... I mean, they were clean and all. 
STAN'S VOICE Look, just don't tell me this stuff.  I don't want to know this shit. 
PATRICK'S VOICE Yeah, okay. 
STAN'S VOICE We have work to do. 
There's a click and Joel finds himself in -- 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Joel and Clementine sit and eat dinner in front of the TV. It's hard to make out what they're watching. They sit on opposite ends of the couch.  They look bored. The scene quickly degenerates.  The room fades. 
PATRICK'S VOICE Okay, but there's more. 
Joel listens. 
PATRICK'S VOICE (CONT'D) After we did her, I went to where she worked and I asked her out. 
Joel looks over at the faded Clementine across the couch. She stares straight ahead at the TV. 
STAN'S VOICE Patrick... do you know how unethical... 
JOEL That must be the guy I saw you with. 
VOICE-OVER In the bookstore that night.  The skinny guy. 
There's a click and Joel finds himself in -- 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Joel watches TV.  Clementine walks by in her underwear, looks at the TV.  She slips into a skirt. 
CLEMENTINE How can you watch this crap? 
JOEL Where are you going? 
CLEMENTINE I'm fucking crawling out of my skin. 
The scene starts to fade.  Clementine puts on her shoes and heads out the door. 
Patrick opens the door.  Mary stands there in a winter coat, carrying a backpack. 
MARY (coolly) Oh, hey, Patrick. 
PATRICK Hi, Mary.  How's it going? 
She walks past him. 
STAN Hey, you. 
Stan and Mary kiss.  She looks down at Joel as she takes off her coat. 
MARY It's freezing out. 
STAN You found us okay? 
MARY Yeah. (re: Joel) Poor guy. (looking around) Have anything to drink? 
STAN We haven't checked. 
MARY Well, allow me to do the honors.  It's fucking freezing and I need something. 
She heads into the kitchen.  Stan turns back to monitor the slivers of light. 
PATRICK Mary hates me.  I've never been popular with the ladies. 
STAN Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties. 
PATRICK (guilty beat) Okay, There's more, Stan -- 
Stan looks over at Patrick.  Mary returns with a bottle of scotch and two glasses. 
MARY Hey, hey. 
She pours the whiskey. 
MARY (CONT'D) Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you? 
PATRICK Nah, I don't know. 
Mary hands a glass to Stan.  She holds hers up in a toast. 
MARY Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders. 
Mary and Stan click glasses. 
MARY (CONT'D) Nietzsche.  Beyond Good and Evil.  Found it my Bartletts. 
STAN That's a good one. 
MARY Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard!  It seems really appropriate. 
STAN (a little sulky) It's a good one all right. 
PATRICK What's your bartlett's? 
STAN It's a quote book. 
MARY I love quotes.  So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's.  Isn't that trippy? 
PATRICK (trying to engage) Yeah.  Cool. 
MARY "The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts." 
PATRICK Very cool.  Trippy. 
MARY I like to read what smart people say.  So many beautiful, important things. 
STAN Yup. 
MARY Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart?  Important? 
STAN (beat) Yup. 
PATRICK Definitely! 
MARY I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day. 
Stan focuses on the monitor.  Mary pours herself another drink. 
PATRICK Definitely. 
INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
It's dark.  Joel and Clementine are in bed.  The memory is already in the midst of being erased.  Clementine is talking in a monotonous, robotic manner. 
CLEMENTINE You don't tell me things, Joel.  I'm an open book.  I tell you everything.  Every damn embarrassing thing.  You don't trust me. 
Mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught.  She is silent for a long moment. 
MARY No. (beat) Besides, Howard's married, Stan.  He's a very serious and ethical man.  I'm not going to tempt him to betray all he believes in. 
Stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to Mary. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Patrick, bundled up and carrying a full backpack, trudges through the snow. 
INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Clementine watches out the window as Patrick nears.  She's crying.  He makes his way up her front stairs.  She swings open the door and hugs him. 
PATRICK Oh, baby, what's going on? 
CLEMENTINE I don't know.  I'm lost.  I'm scared.  I feel like I'm disappearing.  I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me. 
PATRICK Oh, Tangerine. 
CLEMENTINE Nothing makes any sense.  Nothing makes any sense. 
She pushes herself out of the embrace and looks at Patrick. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Come up to Boston with me? 
PATRICK Sure.  We'll go next weekend and -- 
CLEMENTINE Now.  Now!  I have to go now.  I have to see the frozen Charles!  Now!  Tonight! 
PATRICK Um, okay.  I'll call my study partner. 
CLEMENTINE Yay!  It'll be great!  I'll get my shit. 
She runs into the bedroom.  Patrick is at the phone and realizes he doesn't know Joel's number.  After a moment's thought, he *69's.  The phone rings. 
JOEL'S VOICE Hi, it's Joel.  Please leave a message after the beep. 
Beep. 
PATRICK (whisper) Stan, it's Patrick.  Pick up. 
STAN'S VOICE Hey, where are you? 
PATRICK I got into a situation with the old lady. Can you handle things tonight alone?  I'm really sorry, man. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Stan is on the phone.  He's really stoned and watches Mary, stoned herself, dancing in a sexy trance to something soft and low on the stereo. 
STAN I can handle it.  He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway. 
INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
PATRICK Thanks, Stan.  I owe you. 
Patrick hangs up, rifles quickly through his backpack.  He pulls out a silver bracelet, puts it in his pocket, then pulls out a journal, flips through it, keeping an eye on the bedroom door.  The handwriting is a woman's.  He finds what he's looking for.  He reads: 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE I took Joel to walk on Charles River with me last night.  It was so beautiful and charming.  Joel was nervous about stepping onto the ice, but he wanted to please me so much -- he's so sweet -- that he came out after me.    We lay down right in the center and watched the stars.  He took my hand and said "I could... 
EXT. CHARLES RIVER - NIGHT 
Joel and Clementine lie together holding hands on the frozen river.  They look up at the stars. 
JOEL ...die right now, Clem.  I'm just... happy.  I've never felt that before.  I'm just exactly where I want to be. 
Clementine looks over at him.  Her eyes are filled with love and tears.  Then they get vague.  The scene is being erased. Joel is panicked. 
JOEL (CONT'D) Clem, no!  This can't keep happening. Please!  Oh, fuck!  Please! 
Crazily, Joel runs off, passing through a series of decayed scenes: He and Clementine arguing in a car, having sex on the beach, laughing and holding hands at a movie, eating grilled cheese and tomato soup together in bed, Joel watching her sleep, them drinking at a bar.  He arrives at a decayed version of his first meeting with Mierzwiak. 
MIERZWIAK We can help you through this.  Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about -- 
JOEL You have to stop this! 
MIERZWIAK What?  What do you mean? 
JOEL I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased!  Stop it now! 
MIERZWIAK Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining.  What can I do?  I'm in your head, too. 
INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Patrick reads the journal. 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE ... and we made love right on the ice. It was absolutely freezing on my ass!  It was wonderful. 
STAN Listen, it's not erasing. 
He makes his way, naked, to the computer screen. 
STAN (CONT'D) It's not erasing.  He's off the screen. 
MARY Where? 
STAN I don't know.  He's not on the map. 
Stan tries to break through his marijuana haze.  He fiddles nervously with the equipment. 
STAN (CONT'D) I don't know what to do!  I don't know what to do!  Crap.  Crap... 
MARY Well, what should we do? 
STAN I don't know!  I just said that! 
MARY Sor-ry (beat) We have to do something.  He can't wake up half done. 
STAN Shit! 
He jerks the joystick spastically.  Mary, also naked, gets up and looks over his shoulder at the screen. 
MARY (definitely) We should call Howard. 
Stan turns and looks at her.  He's stoned and trying to understand her motivation. 
STAN No way.  I can handle this. 
MARY This guy's only half cooked.  There's no time to fuck around, Stan. 
Stan tries to think.  He paces.  Mary watches him.  Finally: 
STAN (without making eye contact) Okay. 
He dials the phone, waits. 
STAN (CONT'D) Hello, Howard? 
INT. MIERZWIAK'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
The room is dark.  A groggy Mierzwiak is in bed on the phone. His wife lies beside him, eyes open, listening. 
MIERZWIAK Stan?  What's going on? 
STAN'S VOICE The guy we're doing?  He's disappeared from the map.  I can't find him anywhere. 
MIERZWIAK Okay, what happened right before he disappeared? 
STAN'S VOICE I was away from the monitor for a second. I had it on automatic.  I had to go pee. 
MIERZWIAK Well, where was Patrick? 
STAN'S VOICE He went home sick. 
MIERZWIAK Jesus.  All right, what's the address. 
STAN'S VOICE 1062 Sherman Drive.  Apartment 1E, Rockville Center. 
Mierzwiak writes it down on a bedside not pad.  He hangs up. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Stan hangs up the phone, looks at Mary. 
MARY He's coming? 
STAN You better go. 
MARY Hell no. 
She starts getting dressed. 
MARY (CONT'D) Shit, I'm so stoned.  I don't want him to see me stoned.  Stop being stoned, Mary! 
She hurries into the bathroom with her bag. 
MARY (CONT'D) (O.S.) (CONT'D) God, I look like shit!  God! 
Mary slams the bathroom door.  Stan puts his head in his hands. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Joel and Clementine are in the playpen.  Joel's oversized mother reaches down as she hurries by and pats Joel on the head. 
MOTHER How's my baby boy? 
Joel is being bathed in the oversized sink by his oversized mother.  Clementine sits in the water with him, laughing. The mother doesn't seem to see her. 
MOTHER Little baby getting awwwl cleean.  Awl clean. 
JOEL (to Clementine) I love getting bathed in the sink.  It's such a feeling of security. 
CLEMENTINE (giggling) I've never seen you happier. 
The elements of the scene flash explosively away:  Joel's mother, his Huckleberry Hound doll, the details of the kitchen, Clementine.   Joel is thrown into: 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
He sits with Clementine in the parked car, outside a drive-in movie theater.  The movie on the giant screen is partially obscured by a fence.  Joel and Clementine drink wine. 
INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mierzwiak looks up from the computer screen. 
MIERZWIAK Okay, we're back in. 
MARY That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist. 
MIERZWIAK Well, thank you, Mary. 
STAN (sighing) You get some sleep, Howard.  I'll take it from here. 
MIERZWIAK Yeah, probably a good idea. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Clementine and Joel laugh as they try to give voice to what the characters on the screen are saying. 
CLEMENTINE But can't you see... I love you, Antoine. 
JOEL Don't call me Antoine.  My name is Wally. 
CLEMENTINE Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally. 
She starts to fade.  The scene starts to fade.  Joel remembers their previous plan. 
JOEL They found us before.  The plan didn't work.  I don't know what to do now. 
CLEMENTINE (mouthing to woman on screen) Hide me somewhere deeper?  Somewhere buried? 
Joel grabs her.  They run off just as the scene decays into a husk behind them. 
INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Stan is back at the controls.  Mierzwiak's at the door with Mary. 
STAN Howard, they've disappeared again. 
MIERZWIAK Oh dear. 
MARY I'm so sorry, Howard, you must be tired. 
He nods, distractedly.  She smiles to herself as he heads back to the equipment. 
EXT. SCHOOLYARD - AFTERNOON 
Joel, now the size of a junior high school kid and dressed accordingly, is peering around the corner of the school building toward the bike rack.  Clementine is with him, dressed as she was in the parked car. 
CLEMENTINE Look at you, cutey!  What are we doing? 
JOEL This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me. 
VOICE-OVER I'm terrified.  I thought if I hung around the art room long enough, he'd go home and I could get my bike. 
They head toward the bike rack.  Joel's is the only bike remaining. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) Poor Joel. 
They're at the bike rack and a bunch of kids, including giant, fat Joe Early come around the corner. 
JOE EARLY Hi, Jill. 
JOEL He calls me Jill.  Everyone calls me Jill after this. 
The other kids laughs. 
JOEL Just shut up, Joe.  I'm going home. 
JOE EARLY I don't think so.  We're fighting. 
JOEL I don't want to fight you. 
The kids start chanting, "fight, fight, fight..."  Joe Early throws a wild punch that hits Joel in the side.  joel falls and stays down, covering himself. 
MIERZWIAK I'm getting the hang of it.  I still understand it.  But I'm finding him quickly enough.  I'm hopeful there won't be too much peripheral eradication. 
Mary sits on the bed. 
MARY (a little giggly) I like watching you work. 
Stan sighs, grabs his coat. 
STAN I'll go out for a smoke.  If no one minds. 
MIERZWIAK (not looking up) That's fine, Stan. 
Mary doesn't say anything.  Stan huffs and is out the door. Mierzwiak continues to find and erase points of light.  Mary gets up her courage to speak. 
MARY Do you like quotes, Howard? 
MIERZWIAK How do you mean? 
MARY Oh, um, like famous quotes.  I find reading them inspirational to me.  And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too. 
MIERZWIAK Oh.  Well, I'd love to hear some. 
Mary is thrilled, beside herself.  She tries to calm down. 
MARY Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders." 
MIERZWIAK Is that Nietzsche? 
MARY Yeah, yeah it is, Howard.  And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know. 
MIERZWIAK It's a good quote, Mary.  I'm glad we both know it. 
He smiles at her.  She's flustered, flattered. 
MARY (sputtering) There's another one I like, I read.  It's by Pope Alexander. 
MIERZWIAK Alexander Pope? 
MARY Yes, shit.  Oops, sorry! (puts hand over mouth) Sorry.  It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it.  Like I psyched myself out. 
MIERZWIAK It's no big deal. 
MARY You are such a sweetheart. 
There's an embarrassed moment as that line hangs in the air. Then Mary plunges ahead to bury it. 
MARY (CONT'D) Anyway, the quote goes "How happy is the blameless Vestal's lot!  The world forgetting, by the world forgot: Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind!  Each prayer accepted, and each wish resign'd". 
She smiles, proud and embarrassed. 
MIERZWIAK That's lovely. 
MARY Really?  I thought it was appropriate maybe.  That's all. (beat, then quickly) I really admire the work that you do.  I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to -- 
MIERZWIAK It's fine, Mary.  I'm happy to hear it. 
MARY Okay.  Good.  Great.  Thanks. (blurting) I like you, Howard... an awful lot.  Is that terrible? 
Mierzwiak seems momentarily taken aback, then returns to his unflappable self. 
MIERZWIAK You're a wonderful girl, Mary. 
She leans over and kisses him, then pulls away quickly. 
MARY I've loved you for a very long time.  I'm sorry!  I shouldn't have said that. 
MIERZWIAK I've got a wife, Mary.  Kids.  You know that. 
MARY (suddenly weepy) I wish I was your wife.  I wish I had your kids. 
Mierzwiak comforts her with a hug.  It turns into kiss.  He pulls away. 
MIERZWIAK We can't do this. 
MARY No you're right.  Once again.  You're a decent man, Howard. 
He smiles sadly at her.  She smiles courageously at him. 
MIERZWIAK I want you to know it's not because I'm not interested.  If that means anything. 
They look at each other a long while, then Howard goes back to locating and eradicating blips of lights. 
EXT. JOEL'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Stan sits in the van and smokes a cigarette.  He has an unobstructed view into Joel's bedroom window.  He watches Mierzwiak and Mary.  They're talking as Howard works.  It appears to be a very serious discussion.  A car pulls up outside.  Stan turns to see.  A middle-aged woman gets out, checks the address on Joel's building, approaches the only lit window, watches Mierzwiak and Mary inside.  Mierzwiak's resolve has apparently weakened and he and Mary kiss again. This time it leads to groping, partial undressing, and falling onto the bed alongside the unconscious Joel.  The woman in the window is transfixed.  As Mierzwiak fumbles to unzip his pants, he catches sight of the woman in the window. He practically shrieks and jumps up. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY 
NAOMI Don't say "we" when you mean "you." 
JOEL I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy?  If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition. 
NAOMI Bullshit.  Who is it?  You met someone. 
JOEL No.  I just need some space, maybe. 
NAOMI The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems. 
JOEL It's not somebody else. 
VOICE-OVER I hate myself. 
Naomi walks off.  Joel watches her.  The scene fades. 
INT. BORDER'S BOOKSTORE - NIGHT 
Joel enters, looks around.  There's no sign of Clementine. Joel approaches a male employee. 
JOEL Is there a Clementine who works here? 
MALE EMPLOYEE #1 (calling to another male employee) Mark, is Clem on tonight? 
MALE EMPLOYEE #2 On my dick, bro. (turns, sese Joel, embarrassed) Oh, hey.  Yeah, I think she's upstairs in Philosophy. 
Joel climbs stairs, searches the aisle, spots Clementine. 
JOEL Hi. 
She turns. 
CLEMENTINE I didn't think you'd show your face around me again.  I figured you were humiliated.  You did run away, after all. 
JOEL Sorry to track you down like this.  I'm not a stalker.  But I needed to see you. 
CLEMENTINE (seemingly uninterested) Yeah? 
JOEL I'd like to... take you out or something. 
CLEMENTINE Well, you're married. 
JOEL Not yet.  Not married. 
CLEMENTINE Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance.  So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there.  If you want to be with me, you're with me. 
JOEL Okay. 
CLEMENTINE So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again. 
She goes back to stacking.  Joel stands there helplessly. 
JOEL I just think that you have some kind of... quality that seems really important to me. 
The scene is disintegrating.  Clementine's speech is delivered without passion. 
CLEMENTINE Joel, I'm not a concept.  I want you to just keep that in your head.  Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind.  Don't assign me yours. 
JOEL I remember that speech really well. 
CLEMENTINE (smiling) I had you pegged, didn't I? 
JOEL You had the whole human race pegged. 
CLEMENTINE Probably. 
JOEL I still thought you were going to save me.  Even after that. 
CLEMENTINE I know. 
JOEL It would be different, if we could just give it another go around. 
CLEMENTINE Remember me.  Try your best.  Maybe we can. 
The scene is gone. 
INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Joel sits forlornly in the back seat.  Rob drives and Carrie sits in the front passenger seat.  The car stops in front of Joel's apartment building. 
JOEL Thanks, guys. 
CARRIE I hope you feel better, sweetie. 
JOEL Yeah. 
CARRIE Say hi to Naomi. 
INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY 
Faded.  Carrie and Joel sit at the table with coffee. 
CARRIE Who was the girl you walked off with? 
JOEL No one. 
EXT. BEACH PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Rob, Carrie, and Joel emerge from the car, parked amidst a small cluster of cars in an otherwise empty parking lot. 
EXT. BEACH - NIGHT 
Joel watches his shoes in the sand as he trudges along. 
CARRIE Is this the right way? 
EXT. BEACH - MOMENTS LATER 
Joel, Rob, and Carrie step out of the brush and see a bonfire down the beach.  People and music can be heard. 
EXT. BEACH - LATER 
Joel sits on a log, a paper plate of chicken and corn on his lap.  People warm themselves at the fire.  Joel watches couples talking, kissing, Rob sharing a joint with a guy. 
JOEL You were down by the surf.  I could just make you out in the dark. 
Joel looks down to the water.  There's Clementine, in her orange hooded sweatshirt, looking out to sea. 
JOEL (CONT'D) Your back to me.  In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually.  At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt. 
VOICE-OVER I remember being drawn to you even then. I thought, I love this woman because she's alone down there looking out at the black ocean. 
JOEL (CONT'D) But I went back to my food.  The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye. 
A shot of the orange sleeve.  Joel looks up. 
CLEMENTINE Hi there. 
JOEL Hi. 
VOICE-OVER I was so nervous.  What were you doing there, I wondered.  Your hair was lime green.  Green revolution. 
A shot of her green hair. 
JOEL You said... 
CLEMENTINE I saw you sitting over here.  By yourself.  I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either. 
JOEL Yeah.  I don't ever know what to say. 
CLEMENTINE I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.  I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser.  Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod. 
JOEL Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people? 
VOICE-OVER But I thought, I don't know, I thought it was cool that you were sensitive enough to know what I was feeling and that you were attracted to it. 
CLEMENTINE But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know?  I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff? 
VOICE-OVER And I just liked you so much. 
CLEMENTINE (CONT'D) You did?  You liked me? 
JOEL You know what I did. 
CLEMENTINE Yeah, I know.  I'm fishing. 
JOEL You said -- 
She picks a drumstick off of Joel's plate. 
CLEMENTINE I'm Clementine.  Can I borrow a piece of your chicken? 
JOEL And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers. 
JOEL (CONT'D) I remember -- 
VOICE-OVER The grease on your chin in the bonfire light. 
Shot of a smudge of chicken grease on Clementine's chin. 
CLEMENTINE Oh God, how horrid. 
JOEL I'm Joel. 
VOICE-OVER No, it was lovely. 
JOEL Hi... Naomi?  Yeah, hi!  How are you?  I know, I know.  It's been a long time. Not too much.  You?  Oh, that's great! Congratulations!  Maybe I could buy you dinner to celebrate?  Tonight?  I'm free. Okay, good! 
INT. LACUNA RECEPTION AREA - DAY 
Mary does paperwork at her desk.  She looks through her reception window at the sad people waiting in the lobby with their bags of stuff. 
INT. MIERZWIAK'S OFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Mierzwiak dials his phone and waits.  He hangs up.  Mary enters with the papers. 
MARY I need this signed, Howard. 
He takes it, unable to make eye contact.  He signs it, hands it back. 
MARY (CONT'D) Thanks. (beat) So... do we talk about this... or what? 
MIERZWIAK I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here. 
MARY Do you love me?  Did you love me? Something.  I listened to my tape.  I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year.  It's like listening to someone else's story.  I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked.  I can't even say "naked" to you! 
MIERZWIAK I have a family, Mary. 
MARY You made me have an abortion. 
MIERZWIAK It was a mutual decision. 
MARY You made me have you erased!  I loved you.  I love you!  How could you -- 
MIERZWIAK I didn't make you.  You thought it best. (off her stare) But, look, I take full responsibility. 
She looks at him for a long while.  Then, out of frustration, she screams. 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Joel sits across from Naomi. 
NAOMI (oddly cautious) So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time? 
JOEL It's been a pretty lonely couple of years. 
NAOMI I'm sorry. 
JOEL Well, it was my fault -- the break-up. I'm sorry. 
NAOMI Oh, sweetie.  It really does cut both ways.  We were taking each other for granted and -- 
JOEL I miss you. 
NAOMI Miss you, too. (awkward pause) I have been seeing someone for a little while. 
JOEL (trying for enthusiasm) Oh!  Great.  That's great! 
NAOMI A religion instructor at Columbia.  A good guy.  He's a good guy. 
JOEL I'm sorry.  I really shouldn't have -- 
NAOMI I'm glad you called. 
INT. JOEL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Joel and Naomi are in bed having sex.  There are certain sexual routines, habits, they have fallen back into almost immediately.  She sticks her tongue in his ear in a way that's trying to be sexual but just feels embarrassing to him.  They finish and lie there. 
JOEL So you think the dissertation will get published? 
NAOMI I don;t know.  I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny. 
INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Clementine lies in bed with Patrick. 
EXT. COMMUTER TRAIN STATION - MORNING 
The platform is crowded with business commuters.  Joel is among them. The platform across the tracks from them is empty.  Suddenly, Joel turns and makes his way through the crowd.  He climbs the stairs, crosses the overpass and makes his way to the empty platform.  An almost empty train pulls into that platform.  Joel gets on the train and watches the business commuters through the dirty window as his train pulls out of the station. 
INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
Mary gets out of bed.  She has been crying all night.  She's a wreck.  She puts on some coffee then crosses into the living room area.  Sitting there are piles of the files from work.  She pulls the top one out, copies the name and address onto an envelope stuffs the file and tape cassette in.  She pulls another file out.  This one has Joel's name on it.  She copies it onto an envelope. 
INT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Joel says goodbye to Clementine. 
CLEMENTINE So you'll call me, right? 
JOEL Yeah. 
CLEMENTINE When? 
CLEMENTINE Joel, come here.  Please. 
He hesitates then gingerly makes his way over to her.  She reaches for his hand and gently pulls him down.  He lies on his back beside her, their bodies touching.  He wants to turn to her, but out of shyness, doesn't.  She holds his hand. They look up at the stars.  She smiles, doesn't say anything and snuggles closer to him. 
JOEL Listen, did you want to make love? 
CLEMENTINE Make love? 
JOEL Have sex.  Y'know -- 
CLEMENTINE Oh, um... 
JOEL Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now. 
CLEMENTINE That's okay.  I -- 
JOEL I'm sorry.  I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and -- 
CLEMENTINE Hey, Joel -- 
JOEL -- and I'm just too nervous around you right now. 
CLEMENTINE I'm nervous, too. 
JOEL Yeah?  I wouldn't have thought that. 
CLEMENTINE Well, you obviously don't know me. 
JOEL I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you. 
She smiles up at the sky. 
CLEMENTINE Show me which constellations you know. 
MONTAGE 
We see people going to their mailboxes, finding manila envelopes.  One by one they open the envelopes and pull out tapes.  We see stunned, confused, disbelieving reactions as people listen to their tapes. 
EXT. CLEMENTINE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Joel drops Clementine off.  She kisses him. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Joel enters with his mail.  He opens a manila envelope, reads the enclosed file, sticks the cassette tape in his stereo, listens.  Joel dials the phone. 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE Yeah? 
JOEL Did you send this?  Is it a joke? 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE I probably got the same thing as you. 
JOEL I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you.  Who would even know to do this? 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (matter of fact) Maybe it's true then.  It's my voice on the tape. 
JOEL That's what you have to say?  How could it be true?  I never even heard of any procedure like this.  It's a joke. 
CLEMENTINE Maybe.  Call someone who'd know. 
MONTAGE 
We see the people we saw opening envelopes, now on the phone. We hear over and over:  "Is this true?", "Did this really happen?", "Do I know you?", "Is it true?" 
INT. ROB AND CARRIE'S KITCHEN - DAY 
Carrie is on the phone.  She pauses nervously, then speaks: 
CARRIE Yes, Joel.  It is true.  We weren't supposed to say anything.  They say it's like waking a sleepwalker. 
INT. JOEL'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Joel hangs up.  He dials the phone. 
JOEL It's true. 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE I know.  I spoke to my friend Magda. 
Joel is immersed in the several page document. 
JOEL Look, I have to go.  I have to think. 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE Joel, we've fucked.  We've made love. Like a million times.  And we were so sweet and shy and inept with each other last night.  Isn't that lovely? 
Joel doesn't know what to say as this registers.  He just stands there dumbly. 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Come over here, sweetheart.  Please. 
JOEL You must have been crazy. 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE Guess what I'm wearing. 
JOEL I don't know.  Panties and -- 
CLEMENTINE'S VOICE Your dried cum. 
JOEL Jesus. 
CLEMENTINE You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock." 
JOEL I can't stop thinking about you. 
CLEMENTINE Yay.  Meet me after work by the old mill. 
JOEL What old mill?  Is that somewhere we -- 
CLEMENTINE I just wanted to say that.  Come by my house. 
INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Mary opens the door.  Stan stands there with two cups of take out coffee. 
MARY Oh. 
STAN Hi. 
MARY What do you want, Stan? 
STAN Can I... I brought some -- 
She steps aside for Stan to enter.  He does, looks around, sees the tapes and the stuffed envelopes on the floor. 
STAN (CONT'D) What's this? 
MARY Nothing. 
STAN I know what it is. 
MARY Then why did you ask me? 
STAN I don't know.  I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office. 
MARY They have a right to know.  Howard is a thief.  He steals the truth. (suddenly weeping) I can't remember my baby!  I can't remember my baby.  It existed and I can't even remember.  Do you understand that? 
Stan doesn't know what to say.  He stands there dumbly.  Mary slumps into a ball on a chair. 
STAN Mary, people come to him voluntarily. 
MARY I won't allow it.  Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.  What do you think of that?  That's from my quote book. 
STAN The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased. 
MARY (hysterically) Remember the Alamo!  Remember the Alamo! 
STAN Mary... please.  This is hurting people. 
Long pause, then: 
MARY (small) I don't want to hurt people. (breaking down) But these things happened!  All these little sadnesses, the big ones.  What if no one remembers?  What does that do to the world? (beat, quietly) Someone has to remember, Stan. 
They look at each other. 
EXT. PARK - AFTERNOON 
Vague elliptical images of a young girl on a swig. 
SAD WOMAN'S VOICE I was by myself in the park because my friend Davia was sick that day.  I was on a swing.  There was this smiling man walking a little bushy dog -- 
Vague shots of a man smiling, a scruffy dog on a leash. 
SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) The man said something like, "He's friendly --" 
Vague shot of the man, his voice overlapping with the woman's. 
SAD WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) "-- he won't bite." 
MAN He won't bite.  You can pet him if you want... 
Shot of the girl petting the dog. 
MAN Do you want to give him a biscuit? 
The girl nods. 
MAN (CONT'D) They're in my car.  Why don't you --

MAIN TITLES 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Mr. and Mrs. Ben McKenna at the back of a motor coach with their seven year old son, HANK. We do not see much of the background which is receding from us. THEY are studying the countryside from the windows at each side of them. The CAMERA PULLS BACK down the aisle of the bus revealing the other passengers. They are a surprise, consisting of Arab men and women, with an occasional civilian and French Army officer. The CAMERA STOPS at the end of the bus. 
EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
The French driver and a couple of his companions, Arab. 
EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
The CAMERA MOVES BACK TO THE REAR OF THE BUS, photographing the side windows. At the bottom of the screen is the destination board. By the time we get opposite the window out of which the McKennas are looking, we have been able to read the words "CASABLANCA -- MARRAKESH." 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Ben and Hank are looking intently out the window. Jo's interest seems only casual. 
HANK Daddy -- you sure I never been to Africa before? It looks familiar. 
INT. BUS (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT 
Shooting through the McKenna's window at the landscape moving by. It is semiarid desert. A line of blue- grey mountains in the distant. 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Jo studies the landscape. 
JO We saw the same scenery last summer driving to Las Vegas. 
Hank turns, and smiles slightly.

HANK Oh sure. Where daddy lost all that money at the cr -- 
BEN Hank! 
HANK -- table. 
Ben gives his wife a look of exasperation, She smiles at him. 
HANK Hey look - a camel! 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT 
Shooting through the McKenna's window. The bus     is entering a small Arab village, Squat stone and    plaster building, narrow streets, a few carts, donkeys    and one camel. A  few pedestrians, mostly Arab men, few    women. 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Ben puts his hand on Hank's shoulder. 
JO This isn't really Africa, Hank.    It's French Morocco. 
BEN (To her) Northern Africa. 
HANK Still seems like Las Vegas. 
BEN (Slightly indignant) We're only a hundred miles north of the Sahara Desert! 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT 
The bus is passing through the center of the town.     We move past a few shops, everything looking drab and meager. The sun is strong and hot. 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT 
Hank studies the scene outside.   He shrugs.

HANK I dunno. In school they called it the Dark Continent. (He squints) It's twice as bright as Indianapolis! 
Jo and Ban smile at Hank. 
BEN Just wait till you see Marrakesh. 
HANK Marrakesh.   Sounds like a drink. 
Ben runs his tongue across his lips. 
BEN You bet it does. 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT 
The bus rolls on past the Arab village into the open desert once again. It looks parched and grim. 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Tired of watching the sameness of the desert, Hank grows, restless. He looks about for something to do. Ben leans back against the seat and closes his eyes. Jo takes a paper-bound novel out of her bag, finds her place. Hank decides to wander down the aisle of the bus and test its possibilities for adventure. 
The CAMERA DOLLIES BACK with him as he rather aimlessly makes for the front of the bus,. Having left the Arab village, the bus picks up speed, and is beginning to bump and sway somewhat. When Hank is a little better than half way down the aisle, the bus sways in a particularly startling manner, causing Hank to stagger. In order to steady himself, he thrusts out his hand to grab the side of a seat. He misses the seat, and only succeeds in clutching at the veil of an Arab woman. Unfortunately, he pulls the veil from her face. 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
The startled woman, instantly horrified, covers her face with her hands and gives a sharp cry, 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
With the bus still bumping and swaying, Hank staggers a bit without realizing that he still has, hold of the woman's veil.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT 
The woman still covers her face, but from the seat next to her, and nearer the window, an Arab rises and makes a sharp comment in Arabic to Hank. The Arab's robes are brown, with a turban-like hat combining twisted strands of white and pale green cloth, The Arab starts to move past the woman, toward Hank, repeating his demand. 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT 
People look quickly toward the sound, wondering at the reason for the trouble.

INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
Jo seems to be studying Bernard, as if puzzled. 
LOUIS (O.S.) What brings you to Marrakesh? 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Ben seems happy to talk with somebody new. 
BEN We've been to a medical convention in Paris. And while we were in Europe, I thought I'd like to see Morocco again. 
HANK Daddy liberated Africa. 
Louis laughs a little.   Ben seems uncomfortable. 
BEN I was up around Casablanca with an Army field hospital, that's all. 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
Jo his been listening.   She seems annoyed at Louis Bernard's questioning.   She interrupts. 
JO Do you live in Morocco, Mr. Bernard? 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
He smiles at her. 
LOUIS Oh no. (To Ben) I suppose you came directly from Paris? 
BEN We looked in on Rome and Lisbon a few days. 
HANK And Casablanca. 
LOUIS I hope you will have time to truly enjoy Marrakesh. 
BEN At the most we'll have three days.

LOUIS You will naturally be stopping at the hotel Mamounia or La Menara? 
JO Why? 
LOUIS (smiles) They are hotels for tourists of good taste. 
The background, as seen through the windows of the bus, indicates that we are in a built-up area. 
INT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. SHOT 
It moves through the outskirts of Marrakesh, a somewhat more populated section, although the streets are narrow and crowded. 
INT. BUS (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
A persists with Louis Bernard. 
JO Do you live in France, Mr. Bernard? 
LOUIS Sometimes. 
HANK Do you eat snails. 
LOUIS When I'm lucky enough to got them. 
HANK If you ever get hungry, our garden back home is full of snails. 
LOUIS (Chuckles) Thank you for the invitation. 
HANK That's all right. We tried everything to got rid of them. We never thought of a Frenchman. 
Even Jo has to laugh at this, and as the bus continues on into Marrakesh, the three see to be fairly good friends brought together by the artless charm of a little boy.

EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT 
The bus moves slowly through the streets busy with bicycle riders, Arab women carrying things on their heads, men on foot leading donkeys, an occasional camel, carts, horse-drawn carriages carrying elegant Moslem women, and ancient French automobiles. 
EXT. BUS - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT 
The bus circles past the "Medina" of Marrakesh, the market place with its crowds, vendors, shoppers, beggars, and the curious. It swings in toward the bus stop. 
EXT. BUS STOP - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT 
The bus pulls up to a stop, the door opens, and the passengers begin to file out. The McKennas, together with Louis Bernard, are the last off the bus. Arab helpers have already climbed to the roof of the bus, to unload the baggage. The clean-cut airline baggage of the McKennas is in sharp contrast to the Hessianroped bundles of the Arabs. There are nearby fiacres to take the people to their various destinations in the city, and some small, undersized taxi cabs. 
EXT. BUS STOP - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Hank rubs his backside a little. 
HANK Next time take the train. 
BEN (To Louis) Would you like to share our taxi to the hotel? 
LOUIS That's kind of you, doctor, but unfortunately I have some business first. 
Jo tries to be casual. 
JO What business are you in, Mr. Bernard? 
But he has turned his head and speaks something in Arabic to a porter, who begins to gather the McKenna's bags, and one belonging to Louis. Louis turns to Ben. 
LOUIS However, I'll be there later - perhaps we might have a drink together. 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                  11. 
BEN All right. But I'll serve the drinks in our suite. 
LOUIS In that case, I will take you to dinner. 
BEN No.   Now that's not a fair bargain. 
LOUIS But I know Marrakesh. I can show you an intriguing Arab restaurant where the food is different, and the manner of eating exotic. 
BEN (Gives in) Well -- that's what we came here for. Okay, Jo? Simple one of those Arabian Nights? 
Ben takes her arm, in a warm gesture. 
JO (Smiles agreeably) Okay, But I'm no Scheherazade. 
BEN You'll do. 
LOUIS How would you prefer to travel to the hotel? By taxi? Fiacre? 
A moderately well-dressed, middle-aged couple emerge from the hotel. The man is dressed in a dark grey flannel suit. The woman wears a light-weight, two- piece sweater and skirt, She catches sight of Jo McKenna. The man with her beckons to a porter. They are Mr. and Mrs. DRAYTON. 
DRAYTON Est-ce que vous etes libre?    Jevous prend. 
PORTER Oui, m'sieu. 
EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
Jo looks at the couple, then looks quickly away. 
EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
With a marked glance at Jo McKenna, the woman whispers something to the man. He follows her glance. 
EXT. HOTEL MAMOUNIA - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
Ben reaches for Hank, and the McKennas move into the hotel. As they move past the CAMERA, Jo plucks at Ben's arm. 
JO We're being watched. 
BEN Oh come on. 
Ben gives her a look of   affectionate exasperation, and pushes her ahead of him   into the hotel. THE CAMERA PANS BACK to the couple   left standing outside. The woman is still looking   after Jo McKenna.

INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT 
It is now evening, and we are in the double bedroom and single bedroom of the McKennas in the Hotel Mamounia. We are able to see through into the single room where Hank is, brushing his teeth while his mother supervises his getting ready for bed. Jo is already dressed for the evening in a smart-looking outfit. Ben is by the chest of drawers and mirror. He just lust finished putting on his shirt. 
At the far end of the room there is a   balcony over- looking the hotel gardens. By a small    table stands Louis Bernard dressed with unobtrusive   good taste. He is looking into the garden beyond. On    the table are glasses and a shaker of martinis. 
INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
In the single room occupied by Hank. Jo is putting his clothes away.  Hank, having brushed his teeth and rinsed his mouth, emerges from the bathroom. He wears pajamas, but still has his shoos on. 
HANK How about it, mummy?   One chorus. 
JO I'm a little out of form, Hank. 
HANK One chorus, and that's all. 
JO (Smiles) All right, Mr. Hammerstein.    What's your pleasure? 
HANK (Happily) Quo Sera Sera. Like you and Alfred Drake. I'll be Alfred Drake. 
JO What's your key? 
HANK Whatever I happen to hit. 
He hums a note to give her the key. 
HANK How's that? 
JO Pretty original.

HANK Let's go. 
He tap dances a vamp introduction to the song. He's quite professional. Then he stops, takes a pose, and begins singing in a small, but not untalented voice. 
HANK When I was lust a little boy I asked my mother "What will I be?" Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? Here's what she said to me: 
Jo takes up the song. Her voice is obviously professional, but beyond that, quite beautiful. 
JO Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera What will be will be Que Sera Sera. 
INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT 
Louis Bernard looks up with some surprise, fascinated and delighted with Jo's singing ability. 
INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT 
Ben, who is putting on his tie, pauses, and listens. There is a slight smile of pleasure and affection on his face. Hank's voice comes over: 
HANK When I was just a child in school I asked my teacher "What should I try" Should I paint pictures? Should I sing songs? This was her wise reply: 
INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Jo does a turn, takes Hank's hand and he does a turn around her as she sings. 
JO Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera! Whatever will be will be Que Sera Sera!

Hank looks up happily to his mother, as she sings to him with love. Hank whistles a harmony accompaniment to the next verse. 
JO Now I have children of my own They ask their mother "What will I be?" Will I be handsome? Will I be rich? I tell them tenderly: 
They sing the chorus in harmony together. 
HANK AND JO Que Sera Sera, whatever will be will be The future's not ours to see Que Sera Sera! What will be will be Que Sera Sera! 
Just before they finish the song, there is a loud knocking at the outside door. The song trails off. 
HANK (Disgusted) There goes our sock finish! 
INT. MCKENNA SUITE - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT 
Ben goes to the door, tightening his tie on the way. He opens it. A waiter is there with a tray of food. 
WAITER Dinaire for thee boy. 
BEN (Pointing) Right in there. 
The waiter heads for the single bedroom, as the CAMERA PANS Ben back to the dresser. 
LOUIS I can't tell you how beautifully your wife sings. 
BEN Yeah.   She is pretty good. 
LOUIS She's marvelous. Too bad it was interrupted. 
Ben pauses in dressing, speaks almost to himself.

BEN I've had the same feeling.    Often. 
Louis looks at him briefly.    There is a rattle of dishes from the back bedroom.

FADE IN: 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. FULL SHOT 
The CAMERA is slowly MOVING around the interior of an Arab restaurant catering to European tourists. It has a Moorish atmosphere, and the diners are sitting on cushions or low sofas. Long-robed waiters are padding in and out from the kitchens, quietly and efficiently serving food. There are no Arab women to be seen. The air has a smoky quality, and the room is filled with the murmur of voices and the clink of dishes. Perhaps soft music of an oriental nature is heard in the background. The light is supplied principally from candles. 
As the CAMERA completes its sweep around and COMES TO REST on the entrance, we see Ben and Jo arriving.

The headwaiter bows slightly. 
HEADWAITER Bonsoir, Madame, Monsieur. 
BEN Good evening. My name is McKenna. 
HEADWAITER Of course.   The hotel phoned.   Follow me please. 
The headwaiter turns and moves into the restaurant, The McKennas follow him, the CAMERA PANNING them. Ben is interested in everything he sees. Jo glances at the diners, and then a look of surprise starts through her face. 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
They are passing a couple who are seated on cushions eating. The couple look up at Ben and Jo. They are the same two people we saw come out of the Hotel Mamounia just as the McKennas entered. The woman had stared at Jo, and she does it again, nudging the man next to her with an elbow. The McKennas almost pass them, then stop. The woman continues half-looking over her shoulder again, then turns back to her dinner. 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
The headwaiter shows them to their seats -- two cushions directly behind those of the two people who stared at them. 
HEADWAITER I think you will find this comfortable. 
He bows and departs. Jo seems disturbed, looks around as if trying to find another seat. 
JO Ben... 
BEN Sit down, Jo, please.   People are staring at us. 
She sits on the far cushion. Her movements are graceful and easy as she sits tailor fashion. Ben, being tall and somewhat awkward, has trouble.

First he kneels, and then with much struggle manages to fold his long legs underneath him. 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT 
He turns to Jo, expecting to find her amused at his antics, but instead her face is serious, and she has a secret look about her. She leans close to him. 
JO You're right. People are staring at us. 
BEN What people? 
She gives a quiet, warning nod toward the two people sitting behind them. Ben cranes his head around, but all he can see Is the back of a woman's head. He turns back. 
JO They stared at us when we went into the hotel. 
BEN Jo, will you stop imagining things? 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Ben looks at her, then slowly turns his head to look behind him at the couple. As he does, the woman behind him also turns. They are staring directly at each other. 
MRS. DRAYTON Good evening. 
Hearing her voice, Jo turns, looks, and so does the man with Mrs. Drayton. The woman then turns half way around toward Jo. 
MRS. DRAYTON You must think me awfully rude. I've been staring at you ever since I saw you at the hotel. 
Jo slides a glance of "see" at Ben. 
MRS. DRAYTON (She peers at Jo) You are Jo Conway, the Jo Conway? 
Jo visibly relaxes and becomes Jo Conway. It's Ben's turn to give her a triumphant look in return.

Mrs. Drayton turns to the man next to her. 
MRS. DRAYTON Didn't I tell you? I knew I was right. 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Another angle, featuring the man, and Ben. 
MRS. DRAYTON I'm Lucy Drayton, and this is my husband. 
DRAYTON How do you do, sir! 
BEN How do you do. We're Mr. and Mrs. McKenna. 
DRAYTON My wife tells me Mrs. McKenna appeared at the London Palladium a few years ago. 
MRS. DRAYTON Of course we hardly ever see a show. Edward is such an old stick-in-the- mud. So I have to console myself with your records. 
DRAYTON And I must admit I love 'em. I'm not one for this terrible Bee Bop or whatever you call it. 
JO (Laughs) Thank you, Mr. Drayton. 
MRS. DRAYTON When are you coming back to London? 
JO Possibly never again, professionally. 
MRS. DRAYTON Don't tell me you've given up the stage. 
JO Temporarily. 
BEN It's just that I'm a doctor... Yes. And a doctor's wife...

JO What Ben means is that there are no Broadway musical shows produced in Indianapolis, Indiana. Of course, if we lived in New York... (For Ben's benefit) ...where I hear doctors aren't starving... 
BEN (To Jo) I have nothing against working  in New York. Nothing except the fact   that it's very hard for my patients  to come all the way from Indianapolis  for treatment. 
Drayton looks at his wife disapprovingly. 
MRS. DRAYTON Oh dear, oh dear. I'm always saying the wrong thing. 
JO Not the least, Mrs. Drayton. 
MRS. DRAYTON Tell me; Dr. McKenna do you always..... 
The medicine man sitting among his medical wares -- Ben and Jo enter and look down at the collection of claws, lizards, and barnyard scrapings. 
J0 Looks like he has a cure for everything. 
BEN Yeah, there's a lot of that going around these days.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
An old man squatting on his heels and surrounded by a small circle of onlookers is reading from a book. His voice intones monotonously. The CAMERA PANS to the RIGHT and we see Hank McKenna standing watching him. Hank is holding on to Mrs. Drayton's hand. 
HANK What's he doing, Mrs. Drayton?

JO Oh, all that  talk last night was just social chit  chat, Every woman who ever gave up the  stage for marriage is supposed to  want to go back. I was just playing  a part expected of me. 
She pauses a second. 
BEN Well, if you do -- let's talk about it -- seriously. 
JO No, if at all, let's talk about it humorously. 
HANK Mummy!   Daddy! 
They turn in time to see Hank run up to them, followed by Mrs. Drayton.

Drayton appears behind them. 
DRAYTON How are the acrobats today? 
BEN Oh fine, fine. Haven't dropped anybody yet. 
Ben takes Jo's arm and they saunter off, leaving Mr. Drayton to the acrobats. They do it in such a way as to indicate the group is not hold together by any social formalities. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
The CAMERA DOLLIES along beside them as they pass down a line of Arab barbers all busily engaged with shaving and cutting the hair of their customers. 
Through another archway the Arab now dashes down some of the narrow streets of the Medina. Sapling branches are laced overhead creating a latticed shadow pattern on the ground below. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT 
As the Arab moves along the narrow street, with the police in pursuit, progress is made difficult by the many shoppers and bicycle riders. One bicycle rider trying to avoid the oncoming Arab turns and drives helplessly into a lags pottery store. The sound of wreckage is enormous. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT 
The Arab turns into another street where the rows of brilliantly dyed wool yarn hang, from overhead strung along sapling poles. There is in unfortunate collision between the fleeing Arab end a workman crossing the street with a large vat of blue dye on his shoulder. In a moment the whole narrow streetway is saturated with blue dye, and everyone is lifting his robe and hopping around to avoid being stained. The Arab continues on past. The police dash through the street trying to avoid the dye themselves. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT 
The Police reach a narrow intersection where the blind beggars as squatting, begging alms. They pause. There is no sign of their quarry. Then one of them points to faint blue footprints dashing away to the left. They take up the pursuit once again. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT 
A high, overhead shot of the narrow streets showing that the police have caught sight of their man again. But there seems to be something strange about the chase now. Two white-robed Arabs are running. The second Arab we haven't seen before, but he is faster than the first man and is gaining on him.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT 
A closer, level shot, the CAMERA PANNING, shows, the two breathless men closing in on each other. As they reach an intersection in the streets, lighted by a shaft of sunlight, the new Arab comes up behind the original man being chased and whipping out a knife from under his robes, plunges it into the back of the first man. Then he turns and quickly moves away into a street on his left. The first Arab jerks his head up and backward with the sharp pain of the stabbing, Then he staggers into the dark shadows. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT 
A high shot shows that the stabbed man is almost out of sight for a moment so that the police continue their chase after the second man, who has swiftly darted down another side turning. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT 
The CAMERA MOVES IN behind the stabbed Arab. The knife is still in his back. We get a glimpse of his hands, vainly groping behind him. The CAMERA MOVES WITH HIM as he staggers out into the open market place. His shadow on the ground shows us the silhouette of the knife handle sticking out from his back. The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE to follow the agony of his head and shoulders as he attempts to go forward. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM LONG SHOT 
The CAMERA seems to pass BEYOND HIM for a moment, and there, a few yards away, stands Ben McKenna, and his group. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
The Arab hesitates for  a moment, but the attitude of his head shows us that  he has seen McKenna. He makes his way desperately and  painfully toward him. He is finding it difficult to  remain upright and even take those last few steps. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
A closer view  of McKenna shows that those around him, including his  wife and the Draytons, become frightened. He spreads his  arms out to move them back protectively, waiting to see  what is going to happen.

The Arab's head his now dropped to the ground, and we see streaks of white flesh showing through the dark makeup which Ben's fingers had scraped off. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Ben drops to his knees to examine the man better.   The Arab gasps out something in French. 
LOUIS Ils ont trouvés... ils ont réussi à trouver... 
Ben looks at him puzzled. 
LOUIS (English) McKenna... I'm... Louis.... Bernard. 
Ben is quite surprised. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Ben glances swiftly at the fallen knife, and then reaches across Louis Bernard to turn him over and examine his wound. But the Frenchman reaches up with one arm and grabs Ben by the coat. 
LOUIS McKenna -- listen to me -- first! 
With what strength he has, Louis drags Ben down until Ben's ear is near to his mouth. With a great effort Louis whispers to him.

EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
A big closeup of Ben's ear and Louis' mouth enables us to hear the whispering, but Louis' voice is fading so much that we cannot distinguish the words -- at least enough to make any sense out of what he says. 
LOUIS A man...a statesman...is to be killed...assassinated...in London...soon...very soon...tell them...in London...to try Ambrose Chappell... 
Presently, the mouth stops speaking.    It remains still and open. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
As Ben backs away, we see the staring eyes, and open mouth of Louis. Ben quickly puts his hand inside the robes to feel for Louis' heart, The hand slowly withdraws. Ben rises. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MED. SHOT 
The Arabs crowd in to see the details. Louis Bernard, the McKennas and the Draytons are in the center of a large flat cement section of the market place. The Police by now have caught up to the event, and dash quickly into the picture toward Ben and Louis. Instinctively Ben backs away, as do the Draytons, and Jo and Hank. However, Ben still stays closer than the rest. One of the police picks up the knife and examines it, another bends down to wipe the make-up off Louis Bernard's face. Ben looks around for his wife. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Ben beckons to his wife beyond him, to join him. Jo turns Hank over to Mrs. Drayton. Hank stands close to the English woman as Jo comes over. As Jo comes up to Ben, he is feeling in his pocket for something. Takes out a pen. 
JO Ben -- who is he? 
BEN Louis Bernard. Got something to write on? 
She begins looking in her purse. 
JO Is he dead?

BEN (Impatiently) Yes. Yes. He's dead. 
She   produces a small address book. Ben snatches it out   of her hand unceremoniously. He opens the book end   begins writing something down fast. Jo watches him   with mystified curiosity. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT 
Drayton strolls up, out of curiosity. He has also seen Ben's hurried writing, but Ben casually puts the notebook back into his inside pocket, along with the pen. Before either man can comment on the writing, the voice of a policeman is heard, speaking in French. 
POLICE ONE Savez vous qui est cet homme? 
The uniformed French policeman approaches Ben. 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
The policeman repeats his question as he stops in front of Ben. 
Jo turns around at the sound of the door opening, and Ben and Drayton start to rise from the bench. 
The policeman steps aside, holding the door, as a Police Inspector comes out of the office from behind him. He is a short, heavy-built-dark man. He does not smile. 
INT. POLICE STATION - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
The Inspector walks a few steps into the corridor, stops. Ben, Jo and Drayton approach him. Drayton speaks first. 
DRAYTON Ces personnes sont mes bons amis, les McKenna. Mon nom est Drayton. Ils ne parlent pas francais et ils m'ont demandé de traduire. 
The Inspector answers in English. 
INSPECTOR Thank you, Monsieur Drayton, but a translator will not be necessary. (To McKenna) Won't you come inside, Monsieur, Madame? 
He stops aside, and wait. 
INSPECTOR (To Drayton) Do to the kindness to wait. I might have questions for you later. 
He motions to the McKennas. Jo goes past him first, into the office, followed by Ben, Drayton returns to the bench, and watches the trio as the office door closes on them.

INSPECTOR (Precisely) Your passports, please. 
Ben looks at Jo, who fishes for them in her purse. She takes them out, hands them to Ben, who hands them to the Inspector. He scrutinizes them. Uncomfortable, Ben retreats to a chair and sits down, waiting. The inspector checks the pictures against the people he sees sitting in his office, then puts the passports down on his desk. 
INSPECTOR You entered French Morocco four days ago. 
BEN That's right. 
INSPECTOR You are a doctor, monsieur? 
BEN A surgeon.    A tourist, and an American citizen. 
INSPECTOR Three good reasons why you should have nothing in common with Louis Bernard. 
BEN I didn't have. 
INSPECTOR You were recently in Paris? 
BEN A medical convention. 
INSPECTOR You come to   Marrakesh with him in the same bus.    You drank an apéritif with him in your   hotel room. And you ate at the same   restaurant last night. 
JO But at different tables.

INSPECTOR So, Louis Bernard is a stranger to you? 
BEN I met him yesterday -- on the bus -- for the first time in my life. 
The Inspector begins to let his skepticism be seen. 
INSPECTOR (ironically) And yet -- out of five  thousand people -- In a great market place  -- he comes to you when he is about to  die! Is that the action of a casual  acquaintance, monsieur? 
BEN (Obstinate) I know nothing about Louis Bernard. 
INSPECTOR No? Not even, I suppose, that he was an agent of the Déuxieme Bureau? 
BEN What's that? 
INSPECTOR Perhaps you have also never head of the American F.B.I.? (Sadly) It would be so much more easy for both of us, monsieur, if you would cease to pretend. 
BEN Now, look here... 
INSPECTOR (Patiently) The dead man found out what he had been sent here to discover. That is why he was kill-ed. He told you what he had discovered. Why? Because he placed complete confidence in you. Voila. 
BEN Boy, you not only ask the questions you also answer them -- Wait a minute let me ask you a question. 
INSPECTOR Indeed, Monsieur?

BEN Assuming Bernard trusted me as implicitly as you say, I would never reveal anything he said to me, would I? 
INSPECTOR Even Americans, I suppose, sometimes find it desirable to betray a confidence? 
BEN Let's get something straight. I'm a tourist traveling for pleasure. I somehow got involved in an unfortunate incident. I came down here to make a simple statement of fact, and not to be subjected to a police grilling. 
INSPECTOR Monsieur, I would like.... 
BEN (Interrupting) Now hold your horses!   Just hold them. 
The door opens suddenly.   The two men look up.

BEN I'll take the call now.    You just take it easy. 
He goes out the door, closing it behind him. The Inspector sits down heavily. Then he looks up at Jo. 
BEN That phone call I received at the police station. 
She nods dumbly. 
BEN It wasn't from the concierge at the hotel. It was from somebody with a foreign voice who said if I told anybody one word of what. Louis Bernard whispered to me in the market place that something...something might happen to...to, to Hank. 
She comes suddenly as awake as she can. 
JO Hank?    Why H... ? 
BEN They've taken him away. 
She pushes herself to her feet. She is fighting the drug successfully. She almost shouts at him. 
JO Mrs. Drayton took Hank back to the hotel. She is downstairs! 
He stands up. 
BEN Mrs. Drayton has vanished! She never came back here! And Hank didn't either! 
JO Well let's start looking for him.    Mr. Drayton...Mr. Drayton should...

He reaches for her again.    She hits him away. 
JO All this time you, knew Hank was gone, and you wouldn't tell me. 
BEN I wasn't sure, until now. 
She is fighting the drug which is beginning to take over again. 
JO He's my child more than yours!    I had him. 
He takes hold of her again. She struggles fiercely, trying to get away, to hit him, kick him. 
JO Let go of me! I'll never never never forget this! We've got to find Hank! We've got to find him. 
He struggles silently with her, trying to push her down on the bed, and hold her until the drug does its work. 
JO You think you're the only one strong enough to take anything? Ben, Ben, I hate you, with my whole heart. (She starts to cry) Hank! Where is Hank? Hank, oh Hank! Get him, Ben. Please. You damn miserable human...how could anybody...do...

Her legs grow quiet. Her arm relax somewhat. She is still straining to move her head, and talk, but all that comes out are unintelligible sounds and a half moan of anguish. Then she's gone. Ben looks at her a moment, relaxes his grip. He lowers his head down against hers. He seem to be fighting the desire to cry. He finally gains control of himself. He lifts his head slightly, gives her a soft and heartfelt kiss on the cheek. 
BEN (Softly) Darling, if somebody did this to me, I'd say just what you said. 
INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE MOT 
Ben stands up. The weight of unhappiness is heavy on him. He gets a blanket from the foot of the bed and covers her up. He brushes back the hair from her forehead.

As the light of sunset fades into growing darkness, the muezzin stands atop the minaret, arms raised to the heavens and giving out his high, sing-song call to prayer. The call is taken up by another voice somewhere in the city, and then another, and still another -- until the prayer is a continuous round of chanting starting close, moving away, almost fading, and then returning. 
INT. MCKENNAS SUITE - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
The chant of the call to prayer can be heard In the background. We are in the single bedroom, of Hank McKenna. There is one lamp burning over the empty bed, and another on the wall over the dresser.

BUCHANAN Thank you, Woburn. 
Mr. Woburn quietly exits, closing the door behind him. The McKennas stand a moment, wondering what do. 
BUCHANAN Do sit down, won't you? 
Jo hesitates, then sits down.    Ben doesn't.

BUCHANAN We might find him. Quite soon, indeed, if we work together...Louis Bernard was sent to Marrakesh by the French at our request to check up on an assassination plot -- here, in London. A good agent keeps on staking his life. He doesn't always win. 
Ben and Jo watch Buchanan carefully. 
BUCHANAN Bernard reckoned you were a man to trust. He relied on you, to come to us. 
Jo looks at Ben.   He thinks a moment, but says nothing. 
BUCHANAN Those people kidnapped your boy -- in order to keep your mouth shut. That's right, isn't it?

Buchanan enters the office as Ben takes jo by the shoulders and turns her around to him. He takes out a handkerchief, hands it to her. She covers her face for a moment, then dries her tears. She looks up at Ben. 
JO He was scared.

He glances at the piece of paper from, his pocket bearing Ambrose Chappell's address. He is completely alone in a deserted street -- so much so that his footsteps click on the pavement and create the feeling of an echo.

EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Ben resumes his walk, the CAMERA DOLLYING  him. He stops suddenly, as though to trap the echo  -- but the echo comes on after him. Slightly scared,   he now resumes his walk with a more hurried pace.   The echo gets louder. He glances quickly over his   shoulder again. 
EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM SHOT 
A man is following him, at about the same pace.   He is rather well dressed, and appears nonchalant.

Ben continues walking, and after a bit cautiously glances behind him.

The same man is following behind. 
EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Ben glances down at the paper in his hand, and looks up trying to locate the right house number as he walks. The street has a mixture of houses, yards, an odd dirty- looking store or two. Ben's expression indicates that he would like to make his destination before the man following catches up with him. Then he changes his mind. He deliberately slows up. 
EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Showing Ben as he walks slowly along, listening to the man approaching behind him, listening with the back of his head, and with his whole body. The man walking behind is aware of Ben. He begins staring at him.

Ben instinctively clenches his right hand into a fist of preparedness. As the man closes in Ben we see that he is rather elderly, sixty years old, perhaps. As the man reaches Ben, and passes him, Ben's follows him and study him. 
EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Ben watches the   man go on ahead of him at a faster pace. Suddenly    the man turns a sharp right into doorway, and is   gone. Ben glances at the paper in his hand. He stops    and looks up in astonishment. 
EXT. LONDON STREET - (DAY) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
The little side doorway in which the elderly man turned. Above it is an old painted sign reading "AMBROSE CHAPPELL - TAXIDERMIST."

Ben hesitates briefly in thought, puts the piece of paper into his pocket, then makes up his mind and goes through the doorway. 
EXT. SMALL YARD - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
Ben, rather cautiously, makes his  way  across a small and somewhat dreary-looking yard,  and  comes to face a low building at the end of which  is a  kind of small factory. The door of the factory   is  just closing as he makes his way across.

Ben hangs up the phone and starts for the door. He looks back at the group as he pauses in doorway. 
BEN Will you stick around? We'll be back as soon as we can. I don't know how to thank you. 
He goes out through the door closing it.    Everyone stands staring at the door.

INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT 
A non-conformist Chapel. Empty, except for    one figure, a woman laying out music on the organ rack   in the front of the Chapel. The CAMERA MOVES IN on her,    and as she turns on her way to the hymn board, we see   that she is Mrs. Drayton. At the hymn board, she slips    into it a series of hymn numbers.

The CAMERA THEN PANS her across the empty chapel to a side door. She goes through it. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
She comes up a flight of stairs, the CAMERA MOVING with her. She stops at a door on the first landing, takes a key out of her pocket, and unlocks the door. She enters. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Inside of a small, almost bare room, Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind her and stands with her back to it, watching. The CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY to reveal the rest of the room. Sitting at a small table is a listless, young Hank McKenna. He is playing checkers with the woman we saw at the airport who was standing with the autograph hunters, watching Jo McKenna. The one with the dirty glasses, who made a phone call. Hank has caught the woman in a checker trap, and with obvious satisfaction jumps three of her men. 
HANK Three men! You don't know much about checkers, do you? 
MRS. DRAYTON It's time you went to bed, dear.    You'll get tired out. 
HANK Can I finish? I'm winning? 
MRS. DRAYTON Yes, you finish. Edna, see that he gets some milk and biscuits. 
EDNA And he'd better have another sleeping pill...I've got to get downstairs -- 
MRS. DRAYTON (To Hank) You'll go to sleep, Hank, won't you?

HANK I guess so. 
EDNA Hurry up if you want to finish this game.

Edna studies the board with a frown.   Mrs. Drayton smiles and goes out the door. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT 
In the corridor once again Mrs. Drayton locks the door, and crosses the hall. The CAMERA PANNING her. She enters another door. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT 
She enters a larger, more ornate room. The CAMERA PANS her in, and we see first Drayton, who is putting on a surplice -- and then the man who knocked on the McKennas' door in the Mamounia Hotel, looking for someone named Montgomery. He is putting on a tie and tuxedo. He wears a dangerous-looking revolver strapped underneath his armpit; Mrs. Drayton, without a word, sits down and lights a cigarette, exhaling with something close to fatigue. Then she speaks. 
MRS. DRAYTON I wish it was tomorrow. 
Drayton turns, having finished his dressing. 
DRAYTON (Coldly) That's not a very orthodox sentiment. 
He goes to a desk, and takes something out of a drawer. It is a small envelope. He turns to the man with the gun. 
DRAYTON Two excellent tickets for the concert at the Albert Hall -- with my compliments. 
He hands them to Rien. Rien takes the envelope, glances at it briefly, then puts it into his pocket. 
DRAYTON Your box is nicely placed, or shall we say strategically placed.

He goes to a portable record player, which is open and has a record on it. He looks down at the phonograph. 
DRAYTON Now for the most important part. 
He gestured towards the record. 
RIEN What is it? 
DRAYTON A record of the delightful Picco they will play tonight. 
RIEN What about it? 
DRAYTON Music is less in your line than marksmanship. If you will listen, my friend, I will play for you the exact moment at which you can shoot. Now listen carefully. 
Drayton plays the record. 
DRAYTON Let me do it for you again.   Now listen for the cymbal crash. 
Drayton plays the record again and claps his hands together at the cymbal crash. 
DRAYTON You see at such a moment your shot will not be heard. The listeners will not even be disturbed. I think the composer would have appreciated that. No one will know. 
RIEN None except one you mean. 
The assassin smiles. 
Half-glancing at Drayton as he delivers his sermon. Ben talks to Jo. Their conversation is whispered. 
BEN That's Buchanan's phone number. Go on out and call him and ask him to surround the place with police. 
JO What if he asks me... 
BEN Tell him...tell him everything. This is the time. I'm sure Hank is around here some place. 
JO Ben, I don't want to leave you. 
BEN I don't know how else to do it, honey. 
Ben gives her a gentle push. With a regretful look at him, she slides out of the seat. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
In the middle of his sermon, Drayton looks up. He almost falters and stops, as he sees Jo rise from her seat. 
The chapel as seen from Drayton's viewpoint. Jo has turned up the aisle and gone out the door at the back. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - CLOSE SHOT 
Drayton composes his face, but his eyes are serious. Without the slightest pause, he continues his sermon, shifting his ideas in mid-paragraph. 
DRAYTON Few of us pause to think how life's adversities work in our behalf, to make better men and women of us. (MORE) 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 109. 
DRAYTON (CONT'D) But I believe we should pause now to do a little stock-taking -- to look into our own hearts and see what we find there. Therefore instead of continuing the service, I think we should all return to our homes for private meditation, remembering how little we have to complain of and how much to be grateful for. Next week I shall discuss the fruits of our meditation. Until then, my blessing upon each and every one of you. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Ben watches Drayton, with little charity in his heart. There is a stir in the congregation when Drayton tells them to go home. They look at each other, uncertainly. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. SHOT 
Drayton closes the Bible, and begins to descend from the pulpit. The congregation comes to life. The members rise from their seats and begin filing out of the chapel. Occasionally they cast backward glances toward the pulpit, as if surprised at what they have heard. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
When Drayton reaches the two steps of the altar, he beckons the organist to him. She comes, and he whispers something to her. He then motions his wife nearer to him, and also whispers something to her. Mrs. Drayton goes off through a side door by the altar, while the organist makes her way down the aisle through the congregation to stand by the door. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
The CAMERA PANS Ben as he threads his way up through the women who are filing out. Drayton stands at the front of the chapel, waiting. Finally, after a slow and deliberate walk up the now nearly empty chapel, Ben comes face to face with Drayton. Drayton greets him with bland amiability. 
DRAYTON Well this is a pleasant surprise, Doctor. 
BEN Where's my boy, Drayton? 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                 110. 
DRAYTON He's upstairs. As a matter of fact you've just come in time to help my wife with Hank's food. Seems Hank doesn't care much for English cooking. 
Drayton's eyes stray to the back of the church as he talks. Ben, noticing Drayton's eye movement, follows it cautiously. But before he can confirm his suspicions, there is a loud clang of a door closing that gives him his answer. He looks around quickly. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT 
At the other end of the chapel, the woman, Edna, has just closed the door, and is in the process of locking the heavy iron lock with a large key. She extracts the key and puts it into her pocket. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Ben turns back to Drayton to find that his manner has changed somewhat. He grabs him quickly by the throat of his robes. 
BEN What do you want? I'll give you money and keep my mouth shut. All I want is my boy. 
DRAYTON And what about your wife? Did she go outside just to get some fresh air. 
BEN Tell me what you want.   I'll do anything. 
DRAYTON All right -- you'll see your boy in good time. 
With a sudden twist, he wrenches himself away from Ben. He reaches for a button on the altar, presses it. Instantly the door by the side of the altar opens and two rather strong men appear. Ben turns alertly to face them, backing of a little. 
INT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
One of the men is obviously the chauffeur type, and the other one, a handyman type in his shirtsleeves. Ben takes this in, and notices the open door behind them. Ben maneuvers himself toward the pulpit, and suddenly dashes for the steps.

He surprises them with his speed, and before anyone can stop him, he is in the pulpit. He grabs the microphone previously used by Drayton in his sermon. He yells into it. 
BEN Hank! Hank McKenna!    Hank!   Where are you? Hank! Hank! 
As the sound roars through he chapel the two man dash for the pulpit, and at that mount we hear, faintly off, the voice of Hank: 
HANK Daddy!   Daddy, I'm here!   Dad - 
His voice is choked off. Ben jumps down from the pulpit in an effort to make for the open door, but the two men throw themselves on top of him.

J0 He sent me out to call you -- so we could do something before they get away. 
WOBURN I see, Mrs. McKenna -- and you believe your son is somewhere in the chapel? 
JO I don't know, I don't know where he is...but at least these people will know -- the Draytons. If you'd only send somebody to get them.

The back door is firmly locked. 
MATTHEWS There's no one there, sir. 
PATTERSON Are you quite certain the place was full of people -- only a few minutes ago?

He looks at her quizzically. 
J0 It's much too complicated to explain.

The policemen are grouped around the patrol car, as Patterson, the sergeant, talks over a radio telephone. 
PATTERSON So far as we can make out, sir, there's no sign of life. I see, very good, Sir.

PATTERSON Walden, you'll stay here, till the car arrives from the Yard. 
WALDEN Okay. 
PATTERSON That's all, Matthews. 
The other policeman gets into the car, Leaving the door open for the Sergeant. 
JO You're not leaving? 
PATTERSO (Politely) Orders, madam. Can we give you lift somewhere? 
Jo is frustrated, and irritated, but she thinks for a moment and makes a sudden decision. 
JO Yes, I want to go to Albert Hall. 
Patterson looks at her with tolerant surprise. 
PATTERSON Afraid the Albert Hall's a bit off our beat. Suppose we drop you at the nearest taxi rank? 
Jo looks back at the Chapel briefly. 
JO All right.   Let's go.

The exterior rear of a huge residential building such as is to be found in Kensington Palace Gardens or Belgrave Square. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we see a Humber car driving through the gates at the rear. It pulls up at the Service entrance. A man sitting beside the chauffeur gets out of the car. Inside the car are the Draytons and Hark McKenna. We see the man hurry to the door of the kitchen and enter. 
INT. EMBASSY KITCHEN - (DAY) - MED. SHOT 
There is a big staff of kitchen help, chefs, maids of middle-age, all preparing food for what is obviously a big party. The man who has entered, calls to them to get their attention. 
GUARD Hello.   Hello. 
The work falls quiet as they become aware of him. 
GUARD Everybody out into the corridor.   Hurry (He claps his hands) 
There is a moment of bewilderment and confusion. The man crosses to someone obviously a butler, and whispers some words to him. The butler turns to the workers and starts herding them toward the corridor through a door in the far corner of the kitchen. 
BUTLER Do what he says. Come on. It will only be a minute. Come on, all of you -- out. 
The man goes to the door.

EXT. AMBROSE CHAPEL - (DAY) - MED. LONG SHOT 
The street before the chapel is still deserted, and the light of day is beginning to fade. Suddenly the silence is broken by the sound of the bell ringing spasmodically in the chapel belfry. Along the street a few people begin putting their heads out of windows, and the one policeman left in charge is seen hurrying away down the street. 
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we now see that the crowd in the lobby is thinning out. Jo stands alone, jostled by a stream of late arrivals. From the hall itself we can hear the SOUND of the orchestra tuning up, followed by a burst of applause, with a few shouts which obviously herald the arrival of the visiting dignitary in his box.

Mrs. Drayton closes the door behind the two as Drayton advances towards the Ambassador with an easy manner, the CAMERA PANNING him. 
DRAYTON (Easily) Excuse me sir, I have a lot to explain to you -- something very unusual has happened. I must also have the money to pay our French marksman. 
AMBASSADOR (Almost casually) Wouldn't it be superfluous, considering that he's dead?

AMBASSADOR His aim wasn't quite as good as you led me to expect. The target merely received a slight flesh wound in the arm. Worse than useless. 
Drayton still stares, petrified, at the Ambassador. 
AMBASSADOR Then your French friend panicked, and made a fatal crash -- landing on the floor of the Albert Hall. 
DRAYTON (Blustering weakly) I don't see how you can hold me responsible. He was most warmly recommended by our people in Marrakesh... 
The Ambassador now begins to get really nasty. 
AMBASSADOR I'm glad you're able to treat the matter so lightly. I am holding a reception here this evening. In a few minutes, I have to welcome our Prime Minister as my guest of honor -- when I hope and expected that he would be totally unable to attend. That amuses you, no doubt? 
DRAYTON (Feebly) I don't know what to say ... 
AMBASSADOR (Brutally) No. But I do. You've muddled everything from the start. Kidnapping that child in Marrakesh...Don't you realize that Americans dislike having their children kidnapped? 
DRAYTON (Trying to keep his end up) How else could I make sure the American would hold his tongue? 
AMBASSADOR (Ignoring this) And then, to crown it all, you get cold feet and come running along here to hide -- and bring the child with you: Don't you see what you've done to the diplomatic status of this Embassy?

DRAYTON (Desperate) I'll think of some method.   Just give me time.... 
AMBASSADOR (He snorts Contemptuously) Time! 
The Ambassador paces a moment, suppressing his rage, and then he stops and looks at Drayton as if thinking about something. 
AMBASSADOR I want the child removed from this Embassy, and removed in such a way that he won't be able to say any more where he has been tonight. 
MRS. DRAYTON Oh, no! 
The Ambassador pauses and looks up at her in such a manner that she almost shrinks. She tries to say something, but no words come out of her half-open mouth. Drayton, however, answers the Ambassador with horrible servility. 
DRAYTON Right, I'll see to it.. 
Lucy Drayton looks at her husband with loathing. There is a polite tap on the door. The Ambassador looks up.

AMBASSADOR Come in. 
The door opens and a butler enters. 
BUTLER Your Excellency, the Princess should be arriving at any moment. 
The Ambassador braces himself, his       chest swells out a little, h assumes a set smile and       strides from the room. Just at this moment we hear        a String Orchestra in the distance strike up some gay       waltz music. The Ambassador goes out of the door.        Mrs. Drayton is looking down at the floor. 
INT. GREEN ROOM - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT 
Ben is talking.    Buchanan is listening carefully. 
BEN ...recognized him, and he recognized me. So he jumped for it. And that is all. 
BUCHANAN (Slowly) Trying to liquidate one of their own big-shots. I wish they'd stick to their usual custom, and do it in their own country... 
At this moment the phone rings. Woburn, who is now re- placing the two Special Branch men in the room, picks up the telephone. 
WOBURN Hello. (He listens for a moment) Hold on. 
He turns the telephone over to Buchanan. 
BUCHANAN (To phone) Buchanan speaking. 
Buchanan listens for a while, his face changing as he listens with increased interest. 
BUCHANAN Right.    Bye. 
Buchanan hangs up, turns to Woburn, but half speaks in the direction of the McKenna's.

BUCHANAN The Draytons are at the Embassy. 
JO How do you know? 
BUCHANAN We have ways of finding out -- from the inside. 
Ben almost shouts as he gets up from his chair. 
BEN If the Draytons are at the Embassy, Hank has to be there too! 
Buchanan turns his attention back to Ben. 
BUCHANAN (Grimly) You're probably right.   But we can do nothing. 
BEN Why can't you? 
BEN (interrupting) I'm sure she would be glad to... wouldn't you dear? 
JO Well, I don't know.     It's been some time... 
PRIME MINISTER I beg you, Madame. A tranquil coda to conclude a dramatic evening! 
JO All right.   I'm very flattered. 
AMBASSADOR (To butler) Stanis would you put up some chairs quickly. (To guests) Ladies and gentlemen, we have with us tonight...Jo Conway...the famous Jo Conway...she has graciously consented to sing for us .. (To his wife) Darling would you see that the Prime Minister has a very good seat. 
They move off to seats -- Jo is led to piano by Ambassador. Aide crosses to Ben. 
AIDE Would you like to sit down, sir? 
BEN No...I'll just stand over here.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Discreetly, Ben moves away from the group, and over toward a side wall, the CAMERA PANNING HIM. All eyes are on Jo. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Jo adjusts herself at the piano. Her face seems serious. She looks up briefly with her eyes to check where Ben is. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT 
The people in the hallway, realizing there is to be more entertainment, move toward the main room. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
A tries out the keys of the Piano. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT 
People are finding their seats. There is coughing, shuffling of feet, and then a gradual hush. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Ben watches Jo, and at the same time seems to be lookIng around the room, particularly toward the various exits. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT 
Having strummed a few notes, Jo settles down and plays the introduction to her song. We see the great tenseness on her face, interposed with Professional smiles, which she bestows on those nearest her, but always the tenseness returns. As she sings, her voice seem to be rather overpowering. It fills the whole room with quite a volume. It almost seems out of place that she has become so professional in such an intimate drawing room setting. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - FULL SHOT 
Everyone in the ballroom is listening intently, and with surprise, at her singing.

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT 
The hallway, showing people crowded at the door, listening. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT 
The first landing on the flight of stairs above the hallway. No one is around. Jo's voice loses some of its volume. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM SHOT 
A higher stairway landing. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
A second floor corridor, deserted.    Jo's voice fading. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
A door at the end of the corridor. We now hear the song floating up clearly, but much diminished. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
In a room on the other side of the door, Hank McKenna is listening to the music. Hank seems a little puzzled. Then, his face lights up and he jumps suddenly to his feet. He runs towards the door and begins trying to open it. 
HANK That's my Mother's voice!    That's my Mother singing! 
Mrs. Drayton is quite startled by Hank's performance. 
MRS. DRAYTON Hank -- are you sure? Are you really sure? 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Hank turns around at the doorway, to look at Mrs. Drayton. 
HANK That's her!    I know it!

INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Mrs Drayton's face, still awed by what she has heard. 
MRS. DRAYTON What is she doing here? 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
Hank, a little mystified, has no answer. He walks slowly back into the room, towards Mrs. Drayton, listening and thinking about what he hears. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT 
Mrs. Drayton's face shows a new and dangerous thought coming into it. She looks down at Hank. 
MRS. DRAYTON Hank? -- can you whistle that song? 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT 
He looks at her and nods abstractedly. 
HANK I guess so. 
She kneels down quickly to him. 
MRS DRAYTON Then go on -- whistle it.   Whistle it as loud as you can. 
On Hank's face comes a little understanding. He can barely believe what she means. Then he understands. He turns, and deliberately facing the door, starts to whistle the song. He whistles loud and vigorously. Mrs. Drayton stands up and moves back to a chair, as she watches him. 
INT. EMBASSY - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT 
Down in the ballroom, Jo is looking up anxiously as she sings. She deliberately breaks and pauses for a moment and softens her accompaniment. Then she hears it -- a faint whistle coming from above, not enough for those around to appreciate it, but loud enough for the straining ears of Jo. She looks across the ballroom to find Ben, and her eyes go up.

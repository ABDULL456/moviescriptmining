FADE IN: 
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS HOUSE - EARLY EVENING 
A modest but handsome home in the foothills above Gower. 
SUPERIMPOSE: "1983" 
A young boy, SONNY STORM, rushes out -- excited but pouty and a little peeved. He glowers at a 1981 Mercury, parked at the curb -- then turns back toward the house. 
SONNY (calls back to house) Daddy! I don't want you to go! 
MASON STORM 
emerges from the house -- wearing a dark Gianni Versace sport coat with a black vest underneath, carrying some kind of case in his hand. He looks great -- a man of action, not dandified at all by the snappy attire. He squints down toward Sonny, proudly -- very much the family man. 
Mason's pretty wife, FELICIA, appears in the doorway. 
FELICIA (calls to Sonny) Your father has work to do, Sonny ... but he'll be home soon. And we'll all watch it together. 
SONNY You promise, Dad? 
STORM I promise. 
Storm and Felicia come down to car, his arm around her. Sonny grabs his father's shirtsleeve. 
SONNY Daddy ... (very serious) Daddy, is E.T. gonna win? 
STORM He's got my vote. 
Storm laughs and ruffles his son's hair.

FELICIA (tight to Storm) I want you back early. Tonight's the night those little starlets are crawling all over town. 
STORM Don't worry. I'll beat 'em off with a stick. 
He kisses Felicia, ready to leave. 
SONNY Daddy (wants him to stay) What about my joke? 
Storm lifts Sonny up into his arms. He gives the boy 100% of his attention, speaks just for him. 
STORM Knock knock. 
SONNY Who's there? 
STORM Old lady. 
SONNY Old lady who? 
STORM I didn't know you could yodel. 
Sonny may not get the joke, but he laughs delightedly -- just because it's his dad telling it. Storm kisses him and sets him down. 
FELICIA (to Storm) Take my advice: Don't give up your day job. 
TITLES BEGIN. 
INT. STORM'S CAR - MOVING - POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD NIGHT 
Freeway traffic. Smoke in the sky ... flames ... the oil refineries south of Torrance. A police RADIO is on, LOW, and we can hear the SQUAWKING COMMUNIQUES in the b.g. 
We become aware of a black limousine, ahead in the traffic.

STORM Screw his happiness. Tell him I want the lab open at six-thirty tomorrow morning. I want this film pushed to the max, and nobody but us to know about it. I know we got something here. 
KARL You bringing it in tonight? 
STORM I promised my kid I'd be home. I'll be at the lab before dawn. 
Storm hangs up.

EXT. MINI-MALL - NIGHT 
A crummy mini-mall around Torrance. Storm exits the phone booth -- crosses toward a liquor store, which is still open this late at night. 
INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT 
Storm enters. A grimy, high-crime booze store.    Not exactly the place to find Mumm's '36. 
STORM How ya doing? (looking around) Got any champagne? 
The grizzled MAN behind the counter checks out Storm's Versace threads. 
COUNTER MAN Right next to the caviar. (winks; points) There's some in the big cooler. 
Storm likes the guy.    He notes the man's MINI-TV tuned to WRESTLING. 
STORM You're not watching the Oscars? 
COUNTER MAN The Oscars?    I hate the Oscars. 
Storm crosses to the cooler. 
COUNTER MAN Who needs the goddam movies? I get it all in here every night. (indicates his view from behind counter) Horror. Sex. Freaks. Violence. And I ain't gotta pay no four bucks. 
Storm pulls a bottle from the cooler. He notices, on a high shelf, a big stuffed toy. Something for Sonny. Storm stretches up, grabs it. Suddenly: 
He notices something in the big convex shoplifting mirror. Something approaching from outside. 
STORM (to Counter Man) You got a phone back there? 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              12. 
COUNTER MAN Why ? 
STORM (orders him) Punch nine-one-one. 
The Man hesitates, letting a few precious seconds pass. Three Latino PUNKS enter the store. One of them carries a long-barreled shotgun. 
COUNTER MAN Sonsofbitches! You creeps ripped me off two weeks ago! 
SHOTGUN PUNK Shut up. 
He gestures to the register. 
COUNTER MAN Take it, man.   Take my life's savings. 
He scoops bills from the cash drawer (about twenty bucks) shoves them to the Shotgun Punk. The Punk scowls -- 
COUNTER MAN Where is a cop when you goddam need one? (to Punks, threatening) I got half a mind to come out there and teach you sonofabitch -- 
Shotgun Punk FIRES without warning -- point blank into the counter display and the Man! The Counter Man is BLOWN backwards -- cabinets crash; he crumples, groaning and bloody onto the floor! 
SHOTGUN PUNK Now you got half a mind, old man. 
Punk #2 scoops up the money.   The three Punks saunter up and surround Storm. 
Storm looks down at their feet, then to their faces and smiles. Shotgun Punk points the gun at Storm's face. 
SHOTGUN PUNK What are you grinning at, pindejo? 
STORM We ... ell ... there's only three of you and you only got one shot left. 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                13. 
The Punks don't know whether to laugh or just shoot him, but it is too late for either option, as Storm suddenly spins between the Punks and behind the gun. 
The SHOTGUN GOES OFF and BLOWS away part of the back WALL -- BOTTLES EXPLODE -- Storm locks the Punk's fingers into the gun, rotates the gun as a bar, breaking the Punk's arm. 
The others make their move -- but now Storm has the shotgun and is using it as a sword or staff. He looks like a true master conductor in an almost magical manipulation. These pour stupid Punks have become the instruments in his spontaneous orchestra. 
Punk #2 takes a vicious swipe at Storm with his long knife. Storm ducks, goes to his knees, and uses the gun to foot- sweep the Punk. The Punk's legs fly skyward and his head slams against the floor. As soon as he hits, the shotgun is slammed through his teeth. 
SONNY Is that for me, Dad? 
Storm stops, toy in hand -- 
STORM You faker.

He comes into the room, sits on the edge of Sonny's bed -- tousling his son's hair with great affection. Sonny takes the stuffed toy sleepily, pulls it into bed beside him. 
SONNY E.T. lost. 
Storm knows E.T. is not just a movie character to Sonny; he's a real person. 
STORM Who won? 
SONNY I dunno.   Candy. 
STORM Candy? 
FELICIA (from doorway) Mahatma Candy. He was a great man. 
Storm moves closer to his son. He sees how much E.T.'s loss has hurt his son, and wants to make it better. 
STORM (very gently) You know why E.T. lost? 
SONNY Why? 
STORM Cause they only let grownups vote. If kids had voted -- 
SONNY (cheered by this) -- We would have gave E.T. everything! 
STORM We would have given him everything. 
SONNY Yeah. 
Storm starts to rise. 
SONNY (wants him to stay) Daddy -- tell me a knock-knock.

STORM You know the rules. (pulls covers up) One joke a day. I have to make 'em last. 
Already Sonny is most of the way back to sleep.   Storm kisses his forehead -- 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT 
INSERT - JOHNNY CARSON - 1982 "TONIGHT SHOW" 
In mid-joke behind his famous desk. 
Storm and Felicia forms obscure part of the screen -- standing close to each other, beside the bed. Felicia helps him off with his jacket. 
FELICIA There's blood on your jacket. 
STORM It's okay.   It's not mine. 
Storm's hands dump his stuff onto the bedside table -- camera, tapes from case, gun. He gathers the glasses, pours champagne. 
Felicia watches her husband. She plainly loves him deeply -- and is held and excited by his contradictions. They come closer together, clinking their glasses, sipping. 
FELICIA If people knew how sweet you are, they'd never be scared of you. 
She kisses him seductively, unbuttoning his shirt at the collar. Storm still wears the vest. 
FELICIA I'm not scared of you. 
STORM Maybe you should be. 
FELICIA (closer, increasing passion) Why? Are you planning on doing something to me? 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             18. 
STORM A couple of things crossed my mind, in the car coming home. 
Another kiss. They get their glasses out of the way, Storm lowers his wife languidly onto the bed. They begin kissing more deeply. Storm helps Felicia slide out of her teddy top; her beautiful breasts rise into the light. Storm begins to kiss them, she moans with pleasure. The lovemaking increases in intensity, Felicia's hand groping to open Storm's pants. He begins to help her, guiding her legs apart -- 
FELICIA (in mid-kiss) Door's open. 
Not missing a beat, Storm grabs a heavy pillow, heaves it -- without looking -- at the door. 
Little Man is just about to search Storm's vest when he looks up and sees: 
BEDROOM DOORWAY - SONNY 
Storm's little boy stands there, in his Woody Woodpecker pajamas, holding the stuffed toy. He stares in numb horror. 
LITTLE MAN (FORD) 
without hesitation pumps his SHOTGUN, aims at the boy. Sonny dashes from the bedroom as the BLAST rips the door behind him! 
SONNY'S ROOM - SONNY 
streaks to the window, heaves against the sash -- 
HALLWAY - TWO MEN 
Big Man (Dunne) boots Sonny's door open, crashes in -- 
SONNY'S ROOM - WINDOW 
Sonny plunges out just as both men OPEN FIRE. They pound ROUND after ROUND into and through the window, blowing GLASS everywhere and ripping the windowframe and half the wall to shreds. An ALARM begins BLARING. The men glance to each other, flee. 
EXT. STORM'S HOUSE - FRONT WALK - NIGHT 
ALARM CONTINUING. The men emerge walking swiftly but not running, shotguns tight to their sides. They cross the street to a sedan parked in shadows. Up goes the trunk: in go shotguns, plastic bag with tapes -- and their masks, which they have just torn off. 
INT. SEDAN - NIGHT 
Little Man whips behind the wheel. He is Jack Ford, an extremely bad hombre we've never seen before. He STARTS the CAR. Big Man in the passenger seat. We recognize him! He is Max Dunne -- the burly man who took Storm's phone call in the police station and passed the receiver to Karl.

DUNNE (BIG MAN) Punch it. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
The sedan speeds away. 
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - TRACKING SHOT - LIEUTENANT O'MALLEY - NIGHT 
A tall and heavy Irishman, built like a tank, with beautiful baby-blue eyes. 
He hurries down the corridor, radiating intensity. Several cops with him. They turn a corner into a second corridor. 
O'MALLEY Jesus Christ. 
O'MALLEYS POV - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE EMERGENCY ROOM 
Jammed with cops, officials, newspeople.     A circus. 
O'MALLEY 
strides forward into the crush. 
ASSEMBLYMAN TRENT AND CAPTAIN HOLLAND 
side by side in the mob scene. We recognize the two Shadow Men from the wharf -- the ones who ordered Storm's murder. Under the glare of a mini-cam lamp, a female TV reporter tries to get Trent to talk. 
TRENT (emotional) knew Storm from when I was City Attorney ... and he was a young homicide detective - (choking back tears) We worked on... cases ... together (can't go on) I'm sorry ... sorry -- 
Trent's grief is so sincere, he himself almost believes it; his aides shield him from the camera, steer him away, in the direction of where O'Malley is. Holland goes the opposite way. The reporter picks up her V.O.:

TV REPORTER (V.O.) That was Assemblyman Vernon Trent, deeply moved by the loss of an officer he knew, (etc.). 
Medics wheel Felicia's body past, one bloody forearm visible beneath the sheet. 
TRENT What makes people do this? (in tears, agony) Will you tell me? Will someone please tell me?!! 
O'Malley watches Trent pass, weeping, escorted out by police and aides. 
Across the crowd O'Malley spots Captain Holland, who apparently is the man he's searching for. 
O'MALLEY (calls) Holland! Captain Holland! 
In the general hubbub, Holland doesn't hear -- conferring with some other officers. 
ANGLE PAST HOLLAND - EMERGENCY ROOM 
THROUGH the glass partition, we see doctors and nurses going about their examination of Storm's body. 
CLOSE - STORM 
The man could be dead, but the reality is he has survived and still lives.

SUPER: "SEVEN YEARS LATER" 
INT. (UCI) MEDICAL FACILITY - COMA WARD - NIGHT 
We hear RAIN O.S. as two hallway swinging doors open and -- 
ANDREA SIMPSON ("ANDY") 
strides through. Raincoat, wet hair ... carrying a small clothing bag, armload of books and notes. Andy is serious and businesslike but underneath it all, she is the most sensuous and beautiful woman you have ever seen. 
ANGLE - NURSES' STATION 
MARTHA COE, an attractive black nurse about Andy's age, finishes her shift report. She barely pays attention as Andy comes up, starts unloading her stuff. 
MARTHA You're early again. 
ANDY (deadpan) You won't report me, will you? 
Andy gulps from Martha's coffee cup. We see they're good friends, who've split shifts on this ward for many moons. 
ANDY (re: shift report) Inquiring minds want to know -- 
INT. COMA WARD - NIGHT 
Martha and Andy, with the shift report.

MARTHA -- Dr. Cannon ordered a glucose drip on Jimmy See. Mack's E.E.G. monitor's developing a nice electronic hiccup -- and your boyfriend... (indicating Storm) ... turned his head. 
ANDY (electrified) He did? 
In a coma ward, this is headline news. 
MARTHA (excited too) I thought he was going to sit up. I almost shit! 
The nurses laugh. But Andy's glance toward Storm's bed is full of deep care and hope. 
INT. COMA WARD - CLOSE ON STORM - LATER 
Changed in seven years, softer. His shaggy    hair is manicured in a sleeker, longer length and he   wears a smartly short, perfectly trimmed beard. We    glimpse, on Storm's chart, the identifying label: "JOHN   DOE 461Z." 
ANGLE - BEDS OF OTHER PATIENTS 
trapped between sleep and death.    A spectral, haunting scene, full of pathos. 
Ford swiftly hauls both corpses out of sight. 
AT ELEVATORS 
Storm weakly, awkwardly "rows" himself toward the elevators with the mop handle. Then using his hands, trying to grasp the wall and push himself along.

He makes it within reach of the call button and stabs at it with the mop handle. Misses. Again. Then: bull's- eye! The light comes on! 
INT. COMA WARD 
Ford has found the last (Storm's) medical chart -- and the empty bed. He's heading back -- frustrated, angry out toward the hall when... the elevator BELL DINGS. 
AT ELEVATORS 
Storm struggles to push himself inside. Everything an excruciating effort. The doors slap into his litter, trying to close. Reopen. Close. Reopen. Hindering him as he throws a look toward -- 
INT. CORRIDOR - FORD 
stalks this way, ears tuned to the SLAPPING DOORS ahead around the corner. He breaks into a trot --

Storm jabs at the panel for the lobby button -- but the shaky mop handle hits 7TH FLOOR instead. 
STORM Sonofabitch! 
THIRD-FLOOR CORRIDOR - AT ELEVATORS 
The killer hears this -- hears the ELEVATOR START UP. He punches the call button. The other elevator opens. He plunges in just as: 
SOUTH CORRIDOR - ANDY 
comes out of the medicine room and spots blood on the floor, hurries forward -- sees Russ and Danny's bodies! 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org               38. 
She backs off in horror. 
Andy rushes to the ward station, lunges for the phone -- finds it's been cut. Her view into the coma room suddenly brings the realization that Storm's bed is still gone. 
STORM'S ELEVATOR 
The doors open -- revealing   a dark, deserted seventh floor still under construction.    He registers the opposing elevator rising his way --   jabbing again at the control panel ... exposed there ...   doors wide open.  Wild stabs. Any button will do -- just   close the goddam door! 
DING! Ford's ELEVATOR arrives. Doors open. We make out the killer's form -- just as Storm's doors close. 
Storm blows huge relief. Looks to see what he finally pushed ... Shit! -- the 3RD FLOOR button. He puts the mop to the side wall and shoves himself with all he's got.  The gurney wheels around and places him right next to the control panel. Storm twists onto his side and slams a hand over the EMERGENCY STOP button. But the button jams! And Storm's thrusting hand has pushed his gurney even farther away! He can't reach it! 
He feels the elevator about to stop at a floor ... claws at the mop, as a weapon ... raises it with all his feeble strength. The doors open and -- 
Andy crashes into him! 
ANDY My God! 
STORM (hoarse, weak) -- Help me ... 
INT. STAIRWELL - FORD 
Pounding down the steps three at a time.    Gun in hand. 
INT. LOBBY 
Andy hauls Storm's litter full tilt out   of the elevator. A night janitor is waxing the floor, his   long power cord snaking down the corridor. He stares in    astonishment at this nurse racing down the corridor with   a gurney --

As its wheels hit the buffing machine cord.    The gurney bucks, almost capsizes. 
ANDY I'm sorry!    Sorry -- 
INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - BEDR00M    DAY 
Storm blinks his eyes   -- groggy, disoriented. He is in bed, just waking up.    Outside his window: this postcard- perfect ranch scene.    Has he died and gone to heaven? He can barely absorb it:   nature, sunshine, life. 
Storm peers around. He is alone in a pretty room, with Western and Oriental furnishings. He's safe; someone has apparently put him to bed, seen that he's comfortable. He remembers: the nurse ... Andy. 
A TV is on at the foot of the bed.     Storm squints at the digital clock beside him: 4:17 PM.     Storm closes his eyes.

STORM Seven years. 
He struggles to sit. It takes all his strength simply to get half-propped on pillows. Something jabs him. It's a TV remote, on the sheet beside him. Storm picks it up. 
After a beat, he manages to focus on the TV -- 
TV SCREEN - "GERALDO SHOW" (FILE TAPE) 
Heated argument in progress. Suddenly Roy Innis leaps from his chair, starts strangling a white supremacist across from him. Melee. The stage flooded with shooting, fist-fighting men. Geraldo's nose is broken! 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) (from TV) -- Stay tuned for more of: Best of Geraldo! 
BACK TO STORM 
Dumbstruck. 
STORM Geraldo? 
Outside the HORSE WHINNIES loudly and rears up on its hind legs. Storm turns toward the horse -- 
When Storm is turned away from the TV, a 10-second ad comes on. Senator Trent waving and smiling to a crowd. 
AD (V.O.) (from TV) Senator Vernon Trent promises:   No new taxes! 
TRENT (V.O.) (from TV) And you can take that to the bank! 
Storm misses this.     He turns back to:

ANDY (into phone) can't come in to work, are you crazy?! I can't even go to my apartment! People are dead, Martha ... no, I can't tell you where I am ... you're better off not knowing -- 
Mini-TV on countertop.    On TV:   a photo of Storm.   Jack Esposito reporting -- 
ANDY (into phone) I am freaking A.W.O.L. I mean, what am I gonna do with this guy -- (pacing, anxious) I want to help him... my God, he needs it ... but it's all over the T.V., he's some kind of crooked cop with drugs and murder and -- 
CLICK. Andy turns to see Storm standing there, glowering       -- his hand on the PHONE hang-up bar. 
For half a beat, Andy is frightened: unsure what this man will do. Then Storm starts to collapse. 
Andy rushes to him, supports him. 
ANDY It's okay -- I'm here, I'm with you. 
INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

STORM (into phone) Yeah,   that Esposito. The ignorant fuck   who's broadcasting the news right   now. (listens) Tell   him it's Storm. Mason Storm. 
Storm cups the receiver -- steaming -- waiting to be put through. His eyes flash to the room, the house... 
She looks at what Storm is writing: Chinese characters. Storm writes from top to bottom, straight up and down. 
STORM Just some herbs I need for my recovery. 
She takes the list, studies it. 
ANDY No problem. This is on my list for Safeway every day. 
EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - DAY 
Andy's car drives up to the house, pulls into the garage. 
INT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY 
Andy enters, carrying a folder, and stares in surprise. Storm has shaved and cut his hair. She obviously approves. She watches for several moments as Storm, weak but on his feet, holds on to the kitchen counter. He steps out, in wobbly balance. Not too good at first, he tries again. This time he does better, but not by much. He turns to look at Andy, conscious of her look of sympathy. 
STORM (re: himself) That bad ... huh? 
She silently hands him a set of newspaper photocopies. He glances at them... at her ... and understands. 
ANDY I'll be in the other room. 
Storm slowly seats himself and begins to read.

ESPOSITO (V.O.) (from TV) Storm gave me his word that he is innocent of all charges preferred against him in the press -- and that he has access to indisputable proof of this. Battling the atrophy caused by seven years of hospitalization, Storm is struggling even now to regain the strength that will enable him to come forward with this evidence. He has promised me and the K.A.B.C. audience a first look at his alleged proof.

Storm at the "sticking point" in a Scott-bench  curl. His biceps bulge, veins pop as he strains with all  his strength. He ... can't ... quite -- then: he    Makes it! Exhausted. Lets the bar crash metal-to-metal"'   into its cradle. 
E)    EXT. ARMSTEAD POOL - DAY 
Storm swims, slowly gaining power. 
F)    EXT. WOODED CLEARING (ARMSTEAD'S) - DAY 
Storm with two long pieces of cut oak. As Andy watches, he lays them side-by-side on the ground and begins to dig a deep narrow hole. He tests the hole for depth. When it's deep enough, he places the boards down into the hole and begins to fill it in, packing the earth tightly. He goes to the top of the boards and around them wraps a length of old hemp rope. Around and around. The boards stand up about six feet high. Storm steps back, observes the height, taps it lightly testing the recoil tension. Now he begins to punch it, harder and harder. Over and over again. Andy, preparing his lunch, can't keep her eyes off him. She is awed by his fire and perseverance. 
G)    EXT. ARMSTEAD POOL - DAY 
Andy and Storm churn up the water in a splashy race. She wins but not by much. She smiles. He doesn't. She splashes water on him, but he's not in a playful mood.

ANDY (into phone) I'm. sorry ... maybe I have the wrong number. I'm looking for Kevin O'Malley. 
OLD LADY O'Malley?   There's no O'Malley here. 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              54. 
ANDY My name is Phyllis O'Connor. I'm with the pension board of the Los Angeles Police Department. We have a misplaced check here for Captain O'Malley ... 
OLD LADY A check? (pause) Well, listen... there's a big turnover here, people are dying all the time, I never know who's in what bed. Can you leave me your number? 
Andy glances to Storm, he shakes his head: hang up.   He hangs up his receiver in disgust. 
ANDY (into phone) I'm sorry, we're not allowed to do that. 
Andy hangs up.   Thinking. 
EXT. RETIREMENT HOME (REDONDO BEACH) - DAY 
Andy gets out of her car in a sunny parking lot. She's wearing dark glasses and a big floppy hat, so we can barely see her face. She passes a sign: "REDONDO BEACH RETIREMENT VILLA." 
INT. RETIREMENT HOME - OFFICE - DAY 
Andy sits across from the Old Lady from the phone call. A plaque on the desk reads: "HENRIETTA WADE." Both she and Andy look frustrated, irritated. 
ANDY Mrs. Wade, I'll be honest with you -- I'm not from the police pension board. My name is Andrea Simpson, I'm a nurse from U.C.I. Medical Center. 
The Lady listens skeptically, revealing nothing.   We see that she is in a wheelchair. 
ANDY You probably have no connection to this, and what I'm about to say (MORE) 
She looks at him. She has a good idea what's tormenting his mind. She reaches her hand, gently touches his shoulder ... 
Storm pulls back. 
STORM Please. 
He gets up, backing slowly away from her -- seeing the pain in her eyes, feeling his own pain. In frustration, he slams an elbow punch into a piece of gym equipment -- furiously venting rage! Andy flinches at the sound, the violence. 
STORM I'm sorry -- (wracked with emotion) Sorry. I -- (MORE)

STORM (CONT'D) (another furious punch) Why am I still in this fucking cage?! What's wrong with my body? Why won't it heal faster?!! 
He slams another furious punch.     Andy gets up, tries to approach Storm. 
ANDY Mason, please (wants to ease his pain) I love you. 
STORM Don't say that! 
ANDY Why not?! 
STORM Because I can't love you! Don't you see? It's seven years to anyone else. But it's only days for me. 
Andy draws a sharp, pained breath. 
STORM How can I be with you ... how can I want you and take you, when -- 
He can't finish, torn by guilt. He stares at Andy. Suddenly his tone becomes harsh, accusatory. 
STORM You seduced me. You came in here, looking that way, knowing just what the hell you were doing -- 
ANDY (defiant) Yeah, I knew. What of it? I wanted you -- 
STORM You have no right to want me! 
ANDY Then who does?!     I've risked my life for you -- 
STORM Who asked you to? Not me! 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              59. 
ANDY You haven't stopped me! 
STORM Then don't risk it! Don't do shit for me! I don't need you! 
For a second it look's like he's going to strike her. Instead he kicks the tray and GLASSES -- which smashes into the floor-to-ceiling MIRROR, SHATTERING like a bomb? 
Andy glares at him, stalks for the door -- 
EXT. APUMSTEAD DRIVE - IRON GATE - NIGHT 
Andy's CAR ROARS out the dirt drive past the iron gate. 
INT. ARMSTEAD BEDRROM - NIGHT 
Storm stalks in, slamming the door behind him -- crosses in fury and despair to the desk. On the desktop: the news photo of Felicia, Sonny and himself. 
Storm stares at the photo in agony for a moment, then rips the desk drawer open, rummages fiercely. He finds: keys! 
INT. ARMSTEAD GARAGE - NIGHT 
Storm strides in, punches the garage door button; the door starts to open. He grabs the corner of a dusty canvas cover -- jerks it off an Army-style Jeep. 
EXT. GARAGE - NIGHT 
The Jeep speeds out into the night. 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
The Jeep parked at the edge of a cemetery road. 
STORM 
stands in the midst of the graveyard, staring at -- 
THREE TOMBSTONES 
In the light from the road lamp, we read the names: FELICIA STORM... MASON STORM ... JEREMY "SONNY" STORM.

In the garage doorway stands the friend Storm feared was dead. 
STORM AND O'MALLEY 
bear hug each other affectionately. 
INT. ARMSTEAD KITCHEN - OPENING CLOSE ON SNAPSHOTS - DAY 
of Sonny -- now aged 12 -- in a school environment, athletic fields, etc. O'Malley is with Sonny in some of the shots, beaming, arm around the boy. 
O'MALLEY (O.S.) -- It's Sonny, all right. Believe how big he got? He can throw a football forty yards -- 
PULL BACK to reveal -- Storm looks up at his friend, too moved to speak. 
O'MALLEY He made it to my house, the night you got shot. I hid him, played it out like he was dead -- even staged a funeral, along with Felicia's and yours. They bought it. Everyone believed he was dead. 
STORM Where is he now? Is he safe? 
O'MALLEY Trinity School in Ventura. Under my mother's maiden name, Wade. No one has any idea he's your son. 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                63. 
STORM (trying to absorb it all) Then that was your mother.   The one Andy found. 
O'MALLEY Your nurse friend? Yeah. She left your number, I traced you to here. 
Storm gazes with great tenderness at the snapshots of Sonny. 
STORM O'Mal ... I can never thank you. 
O'MALLEY Just seeing your ugly ass alive, that's enough for me. (beat) You wouldn't happen to have a beer around this joint -- 
Storm indicates the fridge.   O'Malley helps himself brings one for Storm. 
STORM I'd give my left arm to see Sonny, just for two minutes. But we can't risk it -- not yet. Not till I get Calabrese. 
O'MALLEY Calabrese? Calabrese's dead. 
Storm reacts. 
O'MALLEY Someone blew the shit out of his Cadillac -- six months after you 'died.' 
STORM (understands) He did his thing -- then they waxed him. 
Storm's wheels are turning. 
STORM The two guys at the pier. They ordered the hit on me too. (beat) And I've got 'em on film. Still in the camera, right where I left it.

EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - DAY 
Andy's car drives north, back to the Armstead house. 
Ford in his car keeps a discreet distance back. 
ANGLE - FORD'S CAR 
as another car carrying three men (including Jones, the cop we remember who answered Andy's phone call from the coma ward) pulls up alongside. Ford points ahead, toward Andy's car. The new car slips in behind Ford's, tailing Andy. 
INT. ARMSTEAD LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Coffee table piled with the news clippings Storm has been studying these past days. 
O'MALLEY -- That night in the hospital, I found the audiotape ... in your vest. I must've listened to it a thousand times -- looking for little quirks in the voices, phrases they repeat ... 
His look shows he came up with nothing. 
STORM Where is the tape? 
O'MALLEY I turned it in for evidence. 
Storm scowls. 
0'MALLEY Don't worry, I made a duve. I'll get it for you. Meanwhile maybe this'll cheer you up. 
From O'Malley's briefcase comes .45 automatic, three empty clips and a box of Glazer ammo. 
Storm takes the weapon with pleasure. Checks the action, hefts it for weight. He glances at O'Malley -- two old comrades, ready to get back in action. Suddenly a bit of sadness crosses Storm's face. 
STORM What happened, O'Mal?    To you? 
STORM O'Malley was here. 
ANDY Here?   How did you find him? 
STORM You found him. The old lady was his mother. (beat) And Andy ... my son's alive. 
Andy raises her face to Storm's, her eyes welling with emotion. He kisses her. They are standing there, just inside the front door, which has a wood bottom-half and a frosted-glass top-half. Suddenly: 
Storm jerks Andy sideways into the room with all his strength! He dives with her as -

The TOP of the FRONT DOOR EXPLODES inward in a SHOWER of flying GLASS! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Three more point-blank SHOTOGUN BLASTS BLOW the rest of the DOOR to hell. 
ANGLE - HALLWAY 
Storm hurls Andy so hard and fast it looks like she will land in pieces. He somehow ends up in front of her on the floor as a masked man plunges through the front door into the hallway, shotgun spinning to cover his advance. Too late. 
We hear TWO LOUD ROUNDS and the masked man's head snaps violently back and he falls into a pile. 
EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - DAY 
Jones and   Ford pull masks over their faces and sprint for the other   doors. Both carry assault rifles. An enormous powerful   third man (Joe Bear), his mask already in place, vaults to   low balcony, hauls himself up to a second story window --   his huge Bowie knife glinting in the sun. 
INT. HALLWAY - STORM AND ANDY 
hurry toward a staircase, their attention focused behind them -- on the first floor. 
INT. HOUSE - UPSTAIRS - INTERIOR BALCONY 
Joe Bear waits concealed at  the top of the stairs, on an interior balcony overlooking  the living room, atrium-style. Through the mouth opening of  his ski mask, we see he is smiling a sick smile -- and  sensually stroking his Bowie knife. 
ANGLE - TRACKING - STORM 
Storm and Andy scramble up the staircase onto the atrium balcony and out steps Joe Bear with his knife and his smile. 
Joe Bear, for the first time in his life, is surprised when Storm smiles too. Joe Bear screams like an animal and lunges with his knife. 
Storm stabs out his left arm like a spear and tilts his body ever so slightly, then clamps Joe Bear's wrist with his right hand. 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                69. 
Allowing his tremendous momentum to culminate like a hurricane, Storm manipulates him in a full circle, catapulting Joe Bear unbelievably into a tall T'ang Dynasty cabinet filled with priceless Oriental artifacts! 
LIVING ROOM 
Ford and Jones, masked, hurtle into the living room, just below the atrium balcony. They raise their automatic weapons, but before they can fire -- 
STORM 
hurls Joe Bear's massive body down upon the attackers! Jones takes the tonnage head-on and is crushed beneath it! Ford dodges, unleashes a burst of AUTOMATIC FIRE straight up at the balcony. Storm shoves Andy to safety onto the exterior balcony and dives there himself, just as the whole interior balcony is RIDDLED by Ford's BULLETS! 
Ford bolts for the staircase, coming after Storm. Storm, crouched around the corner on the exterior balcony, waits till Ford hurtles INTO VIEW at the top of the staircase. Storm FIRES his .45 furiously ... Ford springs back, Storm's BULLETS BLAST the staircase WALL to ribbons. His .45 CLICKS empty! 
EXT. BALCONY - STORM 
rips a magazine from his pocket, slams it into the butt of his .45, reloading. He has it half-raised when: 
Ford appears -- right in his face, assault rifle leveled at Storm's guts. Storm strikes an instantaneous blow, sending the rifle flying. In one motion, he pinwheels Ford over his head, sending him flying off the exterior balcony and crashing down into the Oriental fountain below! 
EXT. ARMSTEAD HOUSE - BALCONY AND FOUNTAIN 
Storm swings down to the ground. Andy leaps into his arms, he breaks her fall and helps her alight safely. 
He reaches to Ford in the fountain, rips the mask off his face. 
He recognizes the man. 
STORM I know this fuck. He's a cop!

race INTO VIEW, leap aboard the JEEP, FIRE it UP and fly. 
TWO MORE MASKED MEN 
appear running down the drive -- SHOTGUN and assault RIFLE trained on Storm and Andy. They begin to FIRE. 
Andy can't shoot and Storm can't drive and shoot at the same time, so he does what is logical for him -- he keeps the pedal to the metal and chases them. 
They turn back, too. 
LONG ANGLE - SONNY, DUNNE AND NOLAN 
Into Dunne's car.    The car speeds off. 
EXT. STORM'S OLD HOUSE - POV THROUGH JEEP WINDSHIELD - MOVING - DAY 
As the house whips   INT0 VIEW and the JEEP BRAKES HARD to stop. This is the    house from the film's opening -- the one Storm, Felicia   and Sonny lived in seven years ago. It is undergoing a   remodeling now. Carpenter's and plasterers' trucks   in the driveway --

INT. JEEP - ACROSS STREET - STORM AND ANDY 
Storm yanks up the brake, full of urgency -- pulls out his gun. 
ANDY What the hell are you doing?! 
STORM We just made the top of the chart, Andy. Every cop in the city thinks we shot our way out of a legitimate bust -- 
ANDY There are no cops here! 
STORM Only 'cause they're too stupid. (cocks the slide, ready to go) We need that film and we don't need any bullshit -- 
EXT. HOUSE - FRONT WALK - DAY 
Andy making Storm put the gun away. 
ANDY Goddamit ... for once, do something the non-violent way! 
Storm is reacting to the sight of his old home -- the first time he's seen it since the slaughter seven years ago. He struggles with his pain and rage. 
Andy, aware of his turmoil, takes his hand. Her hair is done up in a businesslike style; she wears a jacket and carries a briefcase. They cross to the front door -- 
INT. STORM'S HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - DAY 
A pleasant, chatty (and very pregnant) HOUSEWIFE speaks through the open door to Storm and Andy. Sounds of HAMMERING, ETC. in other rooms O.S. 
HOUSEWIFE -- Gee, my husband and I aren't really thinking about selling. In fact, we're adding a nursery -- 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              74. 
ANDY Oh, that's the best time for us to see it! Then when you do come to sell, our office will know the upgrades you've made and we can market your home more effectively. 
Two plasterers troop past, a carpenter with them. 
HOUSEWIFE Hell, come on in. Everyone else does. 
Storm and Andy enter. Andy immediately begins to steer the Housewife away from the kitchen, into the living room. "Oh what a cute place! 
I'd love to see what you're doing with the nursery..." 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Storm casually lingers behind, drifting into the kitchen. He crosses immediately to the alcove where, seven years earlier, he stashed the camera case. 
But the spot has been remodeled!   There's a new wall there! 
STORM New wall ... fucking yuppies! 
Without hesitation, he slams his fist through -- 
WALL 
Bang! Gypsum wallboard splinters, revealing a fake panel of brick adjacent to a real brick wall, six inches behind the new wallboard. Storm reaches into the hole, yanks out the camera case. He shakes his sore knuckles from the blow as: 
HOUSEWIFE AND ANDY 
arrive from the living room. The Housewife stares in shock at this strange man -- with his hand halfway through her new wall. 
HOUSEWIFE (very cool) Just checking for termites He tucks the camera case under his arm -- takes Andy by the elbow.

He leads Andy out -- crisply, businesslike.    Housewife stands there dumbfounded. 
ACROSS FROM CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - PHONE BOOTH - DAY 
Storm pauses in mid-conversation, drops the phone receiver from his ear. Thinking fast, troubled. Andy beside him... both of them keeping their faces obscured as moviegoers and business people pass.

The TV reporter we remember from earlier in the film, the one Storm is now going to meet. He stands nervously outside, smoking. We hear one of the great APES BELLOW - 
ANGLE - GORILLA COMPOUND - STORM 
enters the plaza. He spots Esposito.       Starts forward. Suddenly Storm slows -- 
ANGLE ON ESPOSITO 
as Max Dunne moves INTO FRAME seizing Esposito -- subtly, not drawing any attention. Another man in a suit reinforces Dunne from the other side. Esposito shows terror, but no surprise. Clearly the men have had the drop on him for several minutes -- but there was nothing he could do about it. Dunne's posture indicates he has a concealed gun pressed to Esposito's ribs. 
Dunne and Storm make eye contact.    The message is clear: Try anything and Esposito dies.

As Dunne and the other man hustle Esposito from the plaza -- 
ANOTHER SECURITY-TYPE IN SUIT 
moves into Storm's peripheral vision. Coat over his arm, concealing a short-barreled automatic weapon. 
SECURITY-TYPE Someone wants to talk to you, Storm. 
The man gestures with his coat arm.   Storm's eyes follow to: 
STORM'S POV - PARK BENCH - TRENT 
The Senator himself. Big, as life and cool as a cucumber. Alone and unrecognized on a bench, shelling and munching from a bag of peanuts. Behind him: a caged vulture. 
ANGLE - PARK BENCH 
as Storm MOVES INTO FRAME.    He stops, standing above Trent. 
TRENT What a day, huh? Beautiful! (squints up at Storm, offers bag of nuts) Want some nuts? 
Storm makes no move. 
STORM I haven't got the film on me. 
TRENT (breezily) I didn't think you would. (clears space beside him) Sit down. Take a load off. 
Storm glances to the coat-over-the-arm-man, who has taken up a subtle position about twenty feet away. 
After a beat ... Storm sits. 
TRENT You do have the film somewhere, I assume? 
Storm's hard look says yes.

TRENT Developed yet? 
STORM Still in the camera. 
TRENT Good. Very good. That way I know you haven't duplicated it. 
Storm inches slightly closer. 
STORM'S POV 
He spots Ford! 
STORM 
his eyes flash across the lobby. He spots: 
JONES 
STORM 
shields Andy. Plainclothesman #1 steps out, whipping out his badge. Suddenly Storm grabs the cop with the badge in front of his face and uses him as a human battering ram for him and Andy to escape, plunging the man through two layers of glass windows of the adjoining Hertz rental office and out into the street in front of the hotel! Andy follows through the newly formed exit. People scream. Chaos. The other cops react in pursuit of Storm and Andy. 
EXT. CENTURY PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT 
Storm dumps his "battering ram body" and he and Andy sprint toward the valet booth at the main entrance of the hotel, where numerous cars are coining and going. 
VALET AREA 
The valet is a big fat man in a red Beefeater costume. He is presently handing keys to a large "good old boy" -- boots, ten-gallon hat and all. Tex is just laying a bill in the Beefeater's hand, and starting to stuff his too- large frame into a sleek Gullwing speedster with its doors popped up. Before he can, we see him take a flying seat on the road as Storm and Andy shove in and --

AVENUE OF THE STARS 
Instantly the Gullwing is in flight -- SCREECHING away from the hotel entrance, across the median and the decorative fountain that separates the Avenue of the Stars. But almost equally as fast, two cop cars start to close in on him. It looks like Storm is trapped! But he slams the pedal to the metal and blasts between them, escaping. As the two cop cars crash into each other -- 
FORD AND JONES 
on foot, catch up to the scene.    Too late. 
FORD Get the goddam cars! 
They run off. A crowd of theatergoers stare in bewilderment at the scene of chaos. 
EXT. AVENUE OF THE STARS - NIGHT 
The Gullwing thunders off into the night. 
INT. UNION STATION - NIGHT 
0'Malley scans the monitor above the ticket seller's window. The 11:10 to Albuquerque leaves on track 12. 
The waiting area is quiet at this time of night except for a few travelers and stragglers. 
Sonny Storm, quiet and apprehensive, focuses on tearing open the packet of mustard for his hot dog. He sits on top of a battered suitcase. 
O'Malley returns with the tickets and sits next to Sonny on a bench. 
O'MALLEY Be careful you don't get any    of that guck on your sweater ...    let me comb your hair before your    old man gets here, it's stinking    up in the back. 
O'Malley takes a comb out of his jacket pocket. 
SONNY Quit it, will you ...    you're making me more nervous than    I am already. My father's going to    be more interested in seeing    the real me. 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org              89. 
Nevertheless O'Malley tries to comb Sonny's hair.   Sonny pushes the comb aside. 
O'MALLEY I think I'm more nervous than you are, kid. We got out of my mother' place about two shakes ahead of the landlord ... know what I mean? 
SONNY My dad'll get 'em. You guys'll nail them all. (beat, thoughtful; then) You think he's gonna like me? 
O'MALLEY Does a bear dump in the woods? Are you kidding -- he's gonna love you. 
SONNY Let me see the tickets. Did you get us one of those sleeping cars? What time is he getting here anyway? 
O'MALLEY Soon... 
Just then, O'Malley becomes aware of a bad vibe in the air. A foreign presence. Nolan, and Turner have followed him and Sonny from Mrs. O'Malley's house. Now they approach -- 
NOLAN (calling out) Hey, O'Malley! Long time no see. (approaching) Taking a trip somewhere? 
O'Malley slip the tape from his pocket, placing it under Sonny's Jacket on the bench without missing a beat, as he calmly starts to rise. 
O'MALLEY (to Sonny, under his breath) Make sure your father gets this ... (to Nolan) Yeah. Me and my son are visiting my mother in New Mexico.

SONNY 
stops. Gasping, breathless -- seeing the father he hasn't seen in seven years.

relieved and overwhelmed, grabs his son and lifts him off the ground in a moment of salvation and triumph. They hold each other with all their strength.

However their moment is incomplete, as Sonny is visibly distraught about the stricken O'Malley, beginning to sob at the loss of his surrogate father. Storm turns and starts to move toward -- 
O'MALLEY - ON GROUND 
Andy ... the crowd around O'Malley. Sonny breaks through, with Storm half a pace behind. Sonny kneels, embracing his fallen friend. Storm joins his son, kneels alongside him, both mourning the loss of their dearest comrade.

EXT. TRENT MANSION - RAIN - NIGHT 
No sentries, no dogs. Only a high gate and fence surrounding the fort-like mansion. 
STORM 
swiftly sliding through the shadows, he moves around the perimeter, pausing to examine things, searching for something. He finds an old storm gate to what would probably be a cellar or basement. 
INT. TRENT MANSION - SPORTING ROOM - NIGHT 
RAIN LOUD outside. Holland, Dunne, Ford and Jones. Half- tanked, shooting pool to pass the time and cool their raw nerves. No one armed. 
DUNNE (angry, defending himself) What do we have to do, Holland drive a fucking stake through his heart? 
HOLLAND Sonofabitch. 
But he has a plan. His plan is to try to make it out of the house in one piece. What was once careful stalking has turned into panicked blundering. 
CONTINUE TRACKING Holland as he bumps into things, knocking them over, retreating wildly. He passes a raging fireplace and suddenly out of the shadows comes a voice: 
STORM (O.S.) How does it feel to know you're about to die? 
Holland FIRES in the direction of the voice, and Storm comes out of the shadows standing in plain view -- his .45 pointed at Holland. 
STORM I'll give you more time than you and Trent gave my wife. 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org                98. 
Holland changes the point of his aim and FIRES again.    As he fires, Storm EMPTIES his GUN straight at Holland. 
WALL BEHIND HOLLAND 
A Louis XIII portrait -- where a silver dollar-sized group of holes has just appeared, two inches above Holland's head. They are both out of ammo. 
STORM'S POV 
Holland picks up a fireplace poker. He's swinging like maniac and we hear the sound of the poker SLASHING the AIR. 
But he gets too close to Storm, who snatches the poker away from him. 
They are like two vicious cats whirling. We see Holland gasping in agony and hear the sound of BONES BREAKING. 
Storm then begins the search for Trent. He casually strolls through the house calling as if he's playing hide and seek with a childhood friend. 
STORM Vernon, oh, Verrrrrnon, where are you? 
Storm opens closets, looks in drawers, under the toilet seat, and then proceeds into -- 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
STORM (loud enough for Trent to hear) Let's see ... where could that bad boy be? 
From the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a kiddie game, we are not sure if: Storm has gone mad or what. He approaches the master closet as he continues the taunting melody. 
MASTER CLOSET 
Storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks aside -- looking for something that's probably not there. Trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a jet to the Bahamas by now. 
Converted to PDF by www.screentalk.org             99. 
One more rack of clothes in the farthest-back section. Storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and deafening suddenness: a SHOTGUN BLAST erupts point-blank ... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely missing Storm's head. Instantly a figure leaps out. Storm gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen eye to eye. 
STORM AND TRENT 
Storm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then violently slams Trent up against the wall, pinning his chest with the left hand. Storm takes the sawed-off shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight into Trent's mouth. The barrel simply goes through the teeth and in his mouth. It appears Storm has made up his mind about what to do. Trent's eyes bug out of his head. 
Storm now takes Trent by the hair and leads him through the house, shotgun still in his mouth. 
STORM You know, Trent, I want to kill you so bad I can barely contain myself. But I keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white-bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ... (pause) -- let me put it this way -- I doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long. Yeah... I think that's best for you -- 
Trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about to go out of his mind. About this time in their journey through the house, Storm has stopped before Holland's mangled and lifeless body. If you think Trent was scared before, you should see him now. 
Storm curiously turns his back on Trent for a moment, to pick up handcuffs off the floor. Trent sees his last chance. 
Trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty Babe Ruth impression. Just as Storm stands up, the poker comes flying. It looks like Storm is dead but somehow he steps inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms Trent and flips him backwards head-first into the fire. 
Trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron arrows of the fireplace. He is stuck -- struggling to free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ... a fate somewhat worse than prison.

Storm turns away -- 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. CEMETERY - LONG SHOT - DAY 
We are not sure where we are yet. In   the distance, we see a procession of marching men, all  wearing kilts, and all the accoutrements of traditional  Scottish garb. In the front, several paces ahead of the  neatly marching lines of men, is a single BAGPIPER.   Behind all of them is a hearse, being nobly escorted by  mounted police. 
FULL SHOT 
Now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen comrade. 
CAMERA PAN'S OVER to reveal a section of mourners -- mostly police but with some civilians. The CAMERA MOVES CLOSER and PANS TO the front row, where we see Storm in full police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. Andy and Sonny are standing near at sober attention.

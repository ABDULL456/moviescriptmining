MASTER AND COMMANDER: THE FAR SIDE OF THE WORLD 
Written by 
John Collee & Peter Weir 
1. THE OCEAN - DUSK 
From blackness, a pattern slowly emerges - shimmering, abstract lines form into waves cresting above steep-sided valleys of water. 
Finally the picture settles into a high, wide shot of the ocean and an adjacent coastline. 
In a corner of the screen, the last rays of sunlight touch a small, dark shape causing it to glow in the gathering darkness: A three-masted sailing vessel. 
2. THE SHIP - DUSK 
[   ] She passes close enough to touch: hawsers as thick as a man's trunk, massive black-painted timbers, muzzles of her great guns projecting from every gun-port. 
As the ship glides past and away from us, her name is visible, picked out in dull gold on the transom - Surprise. 
3. ANOTHER ANGLE - DUSK 
The ship in silhouette - RUN CAPTION: 
HMS Surprise Armament: 28 guns Crew: 197 souls. Location: Coast of Brazil, November 1806 Mission: Intercept and destroy French Privateer, Acheron 
5.   THE GREAT CABIN - DUSK 
CAPTAIN JACK AUBREY, with his back to us, bends over the table, studying charts. 
His servant, KILLICK, a pig-tailed, ear-ringed man of indeterminate age, refills the glass at his elbow. 
JACK drinks. The glass catches the setting sun as it drops below the great casement windows. 
KILLICK lights a lamp, places it next to his captain and retires. JACK (Absently) Thankee Killick 
4. THE CHARTS: 
a beautifully drawn chart of the South American coastline. 
Jack's hands place a second chart on top of the first, bringing the north-east coast of Brazil into view. Then another, each one enlarging the view of the preceding one. 
On the final chart we can read navigational symbols and detailed information in fine copperplate script: 
6 fa. Shoals suddenly to half fa. Rocks (exact position unknown). Hidden reef. 
6. BELOW DECKS - NIGHT 
Another lamp illuminates 1st lieutenant TOM PULLINGS, his pleasant open face marred by a diagonal sabre scar running from brow to chin. 
He is making a final tour of inspection before lights out. 
7. THE DOCTOR'S CABIN - NIGHT 
Dr STEPHEN MATURIN, a keen naturalist, sits at his desk surrounded by specimen jars, books and scientific instruments. 
TOM PULLINGS glances in as he moves past the cabin door, but the doctor, placing weights on some finely-balanced structure, is too engrossed to notice him. 
8. MIDSHIPMAN'S BERTH - NIGHT 
In the quarters for the 'young gentlemen', boys trained from an early age to become officers, four lads play at marbles. 
PETER CALAMY (16) and LORD BLAKENEY (13) are arguing about whether a marble was inside outside the circle as their berth mates BOYLE (15) and WILLIAMSON (14) wait for the game to resume. 
BLAKENEY In CALAMY Out. 
BLAKENEY In. It was here. The line is in. 
CALAMY It was there. It was out. Out 
BLAKENEY In. Tell him Boyle. It was in I say. 
The lamp moves on, illuminating a fifth midshipman, much older than the rest. This is HOLLOM, aged 24. He's a sensitive-looking fellow, idly strumming a guitar, glancing up briefly as TOM PULLINGS passes. 
9. GUN-DECK - NIGHT 
By the galley stove at the forward end of the gun-deck a few of the foremast hands enjoy a last smoke and a mug of grog. 
Faster Doudle passes his mug to Higgins who guzzles it down greedily 
One man, BECKETT, sits shirtless while another, AWKWARD DAVIES, brow furrowed with concentration, tattoos the first link of what will be a great chain round BECKETT's waist. 
JOE PLAICE, at 45 one of the oldest men on board, stops in the middle of a story as PULLINGS passes, everyone knuckling their foreheads in deference to the officer. 
10.    BETWEEN TWO GUNS - NIGHT 
Boys no more than eight or nine years old play a game of 'jacks' with some sheep bones. ADDISON, RYE and SWIFT are the powder-monkeys who ferry powder from the hold to the guns during action. 
A hint of daylight to the east. The mist beginning to shift as an offshore breeze picks up. LEAD-MAN 90 fathoms, white shelly sand. 
CALAMY Four knots, Sir. 
BONDEN is still at the wheel. 
BONDEN Oi reckon as she's liftin' Sir, if you feels like putting your Ã©ad down. 
JACK takes his advice and goes below again. 
19. - THE SHIP (TIMELAPSE) 
The sky a shade paler. A wind coming up. 
20.    ON THE STARBOARD GANGWAY - DAWN 
The lookout, VINCENT, peers into the mist. 
VINCENT Starboard gangway ahoy. 
HOLLOM, the oldest of the midshipmen, whose watch it now is, appears at his shoulder. 
HOLLOM What is it, Vincent? 
VINCENT I heard something. A bell. 
HOLLOM peers out into the fog, then turns. 
HOLLOM Native fisherman perhaps. (shouts) Mr. Calamy! 
Midshipman CALAMY comes running forward. 
HOLLOM (CONT'D) The lead, if you please. 
Young CALAMY takes the lead, scrambles into the chains at the bow of the ship and throws out the lead line. 
HOLLOM takes up a telescope and searches through the eddies of fog. Over HOLLOM's P.O.V. we can hear CALAMY sounding the depth. 
CALAMY (O.S.) Sixty fathoms, white sand! 
Hollom folds his telescope 
HOLLOM Well. It can't have been a reef marker. 
CALAMY, unconvinced, checks through his own telescope 
HOLLOM (CONT'D) False alarm Mr CALAMY 
CALAMY ignores him, still scanning 
21.   TELESCOPE POV 
The telescope pans. A dark shape in the distance. The mist parts a little. A ship. Coming straight toward them. 
Close on CALAMY as he turns to camera, screaming - 
CALAMY Enemy on the larboard bow! Beat to quarters! 
22. JACK'S SLEEP CABIN 
JACK instantly awake, piling out of his bed, still dressed. 
23.     BERTH-DECK - DAWN 
A drum blazes as the off-duty watch tumble out of their hammocks and run to their battle stations. 
24. COCKPIT, ORLOP DECK 
Rows of wicked-looking instruments are hastily thrown on the operating table by PADEEN, MATURIN's servant - saws, retractors and knives glistening in the lamp-light. 
DR. MATURIN hurries in blinking sleep out of his eyes as he ties on his black apron - behind him, HIGGINS, the assistant surgeon. 
25.   POWDER MAGAZINE 
Little ADDISON and his team of powder-monkeys run with their boxes of gunpowder to the... 
26. GUN-DECK 
As LAMB, NAGEL and the other carpenters bash down cabin partitions, transforming the entire gun-deck into a single continuous space, from the bows to the Captain's Great Cabin in the stern. 
As the crews swarm about their guns, grotesque shadows are thrown on the walls and ceiling by the numerous battle- lanterns arriving to illuminate the scene. 
27. WEATHER-DECK 
JACK and PULLINGS stride the length of the deck toward the bow [ ] . They pass crews manning the carronades while others swing the ship's small boats out and over the side to be towed behind the ship. 
28. FORECASTLE 
PULLINGS Fire on the uproll. 
The little drummer's huge eyes are fixed on PULLINGS' face. The ship rolls. 
PULLINGS (CONT'D) Fire! 
The drum-roll is all but drowned by the blast of the guns. 
The smoke clears, the gunners look on baffled as their balls bounce harmlessly off the side of the enemy ship. 
OLD SPONGE (In Greek) Witchcraft! 
DOUDLE Never seen the like of it 
PULLINGS Damn and blast you! See to your guns! Fire high! Fire for the masts and rigging! 
As the enemy's murderous long guns run out again. 
41.   WIDE ON THE ENEMY SHIP 
Her French ensign clearly visible as she swings broadside on to the approaching Surprise - again her side lights up in a series of red flashes. 
42.   IN THE COCKPIT 
By the dim light of a battle-lantern STEPHEN struggles to hold a wounded man on the table, his feet slipping in pools of blood on the deck. 
STEPHEN More sand on the floor, Mr. Higgins! 
The slightly hung-over HIGGINS reaches for the sand bucket and is thrown over by the awful jarring shock as the Acheron's third broadside hits home. 
43.   IN THE GREAT CABIN - 
The Captain's crockery smashes to the deck. KILLICK, cursing freely, stows what he can. 44.   IN THE ORLOP 
Shards of timber implode, followed by a great spout of water knocking the massive AWKWARD DAVIES sideways as he runs for the ladder carrying two cannon-balls. 
A second explosion, a second jet of water and DAVIES, finding his feet, starts yelling for the carpenter. 
DAVIES Wood and Lead! Mr Nagel! Mr Lamb!! 
45. STAIRS 
Follow DAVIES as he runs up to the gun-deck with the shot under his arms past the powder-monkeys ADDISON and SWIFT, canisters of gun-powder slung over their shoulders, then he sees MR. LAMB, the carpenter. 
DAVIES Orlop! We're holed! 
As LAMB dives for the ladder. 
46.   ON THE GUN-DECK 
DAVIES arrives to find a gaping hole opposite where his own gun once stood. Its crew lie scattered, horribly wounded or dead. 
The dismounted gun and twelve pound shot are rolling around dangerously. HOLLOM, the sole survivor, is backed against the bulkhead, cradling an injured arm. 
CALAMY emerges from the smoke, meets DAVIES's horror-struck gaze and takes command. 
CALAMY Davies! Get those bodies overboard! (to HOLLOM) Mr. Hollom sir! 
HOLLOM sits immobilized by fear. CALAMY grabs the poulterer, JEMMY DUCKS, who has been rescuing the ship's goat, Aspasia. 
CALAMY (CONT'D) Jemmy - leave the damned goat and take Mr. Hollom below. 
JEMMY DUCKS Aye, sir! 
The ship heels as she turns. 
Midshipman BLAKENEY, Calamy's rival in the game of marbles, turns to see the dismounted gun rolling free. He throws a hammock net under it, stopping its roll before it crushes CALAMY against the bulkhead. 
CALAMY shoots him a brief look of gratitude and runs aft. BLAKENEY carries on shouting to the powder-monkeys - 
BLAKENEY More shot! More cartridge! 
47.   HULL OF THE SURPRISE 
In the great jagged hole on the gun-deck where the gun was destroyed, JACK stands framed, a wrathful soot-stained figure. He glances back at his men, hunched and ready, itching to fire. 
JACK (bellows) Steady... Wait for it! 
48. WIDE ON THE BATTLE 
to see the two ships about to pass abreast, the Surprise heading south as it were, the enemy ship, north. 
The French vessel is clearly the bigger ship, and from both come the sounds of shouted orders and the thunder of drums. They will pass broadside to broadside, 500 yards apart. 
49.   GUN-DECK, SURPRISE 
JACK watching the enemy, judging the moment. 
61.   STERN OF THE SURPRISE 
Sudden feverish activity, running and shouting as men scramble down into the boats. DAVIES settles himself beside NAGEL in the cutter, turning to look at the approaching Acheron. 
His P.O.V.: puffs of smoke from its bow-chasers. 
PULLINGS Sail trimmers away, Warley, make what sail you can! 
JACK Stern-chasers to fire when she's in range! 
62.   STERN OF SURPRISE 
Gouts of water from the enemy gunfire rise not fifty yards from them, acting as little needed encouragement for the boats to get clear of the stern and pull around towards the bows as.... 
64.   MAINMAST/FOREMAST 
Men scramble up the ratlines, and through the shattered rigging. 
65.   THE GREAT CABIN 
Two long brass nine-pounders set up through the open windows of the Captain's day cabin, open fire on the approaching Acheron. 
MOWETT Fire! 
65A. MAINMAST 
WARLEY, captain of the maintop, directs his men about the mare's nest of rigging, getting a tattered top-sail to fill with what little breeze there is. 
WARLEY Sharp now with that fancy-line! To the clew line from the reef points, Cully, double up and run her back again! 
66. QUARTERDECK 
Through PULLINGS' telescope: the enemy ship coming straight at them, her guns now getting the range of the Surprise. 
PULLINGS She's gaining on us. 
JACK Start the water, carronades over the side. 
67.   ANGLE ON THE QUARTERDECK 
Crewmen furiously at work cutting the ropes securing the guns on the quarterdeck. 
68.   ANGLE ON THE STERN 
Water spouts from the pumps, while at the same time the quarterdeck guns tumble into the ocean. (NOTE: they only abandon guns on the quarterdeck, not their main armament on the gun-deck.) 
69. FORECASTLE 
JACK races to the bows. Towlines strain as the three small boats pull the great ship toward the curtain of fog and cloud. He yells to the straining oarsmen - 
JACK Pull! Pull for your lives. 
70.   ANGLE FROM THE BOATS 
The men heave on their oars, faces bathed in sweat, the towlines taut behind them, dragging the Surprise toward the safety of the fog-bank. 
71. WIDE 
to see the Surprise slipping into the cover of fog and low cloud, only her top masts visible, before they too disappear. 
72. QUARTERDECK 
JACK joins his officers looking back into the white-out, in the direction of the enemy. 
JACK Quiet now. No calls, no shouts. Mr. ALLEN, signal the men in the boats to head due east. 
ALLEN hurries toward the bows, as behind them the fog is momentarily illuminated by flashes of gunfire from their pursuer. 
73.   THE LEADING JOLLY BOAT 
CALAMY, in the prow of the jolly-boat, sees ALLEN on the ship, signalling the turn to eastward. 
CALAMY signals to BONDEN in the stern of the jolly-boat. 
BONDEN (urgent whisper) Starboard haul. And stroke! Stroke! 
One side stops rowing and the boat turns. 74.   THE SURPRISE 
A low angle, the ship coming slowly toward us. 
Beyond, the rowers strain at their oars, the great ship rearing out of the mist above them, as though carried on their backs. 
75.   QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE 
Somewhere astern and to the left JACK can hear shouting on the Acheron. Flashes of cannon fire, directed away from them. 
PULLINGS He's beating inshore. 
ALLEN ...Call her a frigate? Ha! You ask me she's no more a frigate than a painted Dutchman. More like a ship of the line, a two-decker more'n a frigate. 
MOWETT is trying to staunch a persistent nosebleed. 
MOWETT One does wonder what manner of hull she has. Our balls seemed to bounce right off her. 
Jack enters, his head newly bandaged. He walks past the seated officers and stands looking out through the stern windows. The officers continue their conversation, though their words are intended for Jack 
PULLINGS She had the weather-gauge and long eighteens which could hit us beyond our effective range. That's the sum of it 
ALLEN And   40 guns to our 28, I counted the muzzle flashes. 
PULLINGS It was an unfair match, no dishonor in defeat no dishonor at all. 
Jack still has his back to them. He puts his hand in his pocket and finds something there - the shattered fragments of his gold pocket watch. 
ALLEN (sighs) Well, we can patch up our main and mizzen the foresail is too far gone so we'll bend our spare. 
PULLINGS Sir. 
Jack finally turns. 
PULLINGS (CONT'D) Mr. Allen is confident, with basic repairs, we can get home as we are... allowing for a stop in Jamaica. 
ALLEN At Port Royal we can haul her into dry- dock, and hopefully get her home without... 
JACK We're not going home. 
An expectant hush. KILLICK is all ears, as he picks up the coffee cups and places them carefully on a silver tray. 
JACK (CONT'D) What is our purpose here gentlemen? Why were we sent? To punish a blackguard privateer who has decimated our Atlantic whaling fleet and now threatens to do the same in the pacific. Are we to leave those ships to his mercy and slink back into Portsmouth - another defeat to add to the list. Is that what we draw our wages for? I say we pursue her and pay her back with interest 
ALLEN With respect, Captain, she could be half- way to Cape Horn by the time we're repaired and underway. 
JACK (sternly) Then there's not a moment to lose. 
83.   OUTSIDE THE GREAT CABIN 
KILLICK exits the cabin with the tray of coffee cups. As he passes them to his mate, BLACK BILL - 
KILLICK (a whisper) We're for the Horn. 
84.     THROUGHOUT THE SHIP - DAWN 
Word passes like lightning from the wounded in the orlop, to the beak of the ship 
MUTTERED VOICES AD LIB -   The Horn you say? -   Never! In this condition? -   Eh? What news mates -   Heading for where?! 
85.     FORECASTLE - DAWN 
A few of the old 'Surprises' have gathered for a smoke, all of them men who've sailed with JACK before: Jittery alcoholic Higgins, loyal Nehemiah Slade, sharp-faced tobacco-chewing Faster Doudle, and the big Welshman Awkward Davies, still shaken by the loss of his gun-crew. 
higgins We're for hell in a hand-barrow if you ask my opinion 
slade I'm game. If the captain says we can take her we can take her. 
DAVIES Can we catch her is the question. And if we do what's different? She'll just hold us off with them long eighteens til she sends us all to the bottom. All for what? 
DOUDLE I'll tell you for what, matey. She's a privateer, loaded with all the gems of Araby. Think of the gold. Think of the prize-money. 
HOLLAR Hoi there! You men jump to it! 
86.     WAIST OF THE SHIP - NOON 
The gratings are hauled aside and light floods down into the gun-deck. 
87.     GUN-DECK - DAY 
Part of a huge tree-trunk - spare timber for repairs - is manhandled by a dozen crewmen. 
HOLLAR Heave. And heave. Handsomely now. One long pull. Belay! 
88.     QUARTERDECK - DAY 
Crewmen labour at the capstan. 
HOLLAR (O.S.) Two six heave! Two six heave! 
The huge log rises from below and hangs suspended from its gantry. JACK shouts down from the quarterdeck - 
JACK Have her placed along the gunwale for now, Mr. Hollar, and the guns moved to that side also. 
89.   ABOVE JACK'S HEAD 
Men are hanging in the rigging throwing down damaged sections of rope. 
FASTER DOUDLE All clear below! 
A rippling broadside, the crews sweating over their guns. 
JACK And pitch 'em up! It's spars and rigging we want! 
MOWETT timing the gap between each broadside. 
MOWETT Three minutes ten, Sir. 
JACK Not good enough! We must fire three broadsides to her two. Again! 
Turning to BLAKENEY, who though much recovered, still looks pale and a little unsure of himself. 
JACK (CONT'D) Mr. Blakeney? Think you can supervise a gun? BLAKENEY As you will. Sir. 
JACK 'Spitfire', hop to it. 
BLAKENEY takes command of the gun. To one side CALAMY is in charge of 'Beelzebub', on the other side HOLLOM is now directing 'Sudden Death'. 
Once again the orders are given, and the crews, now competing with each other, go through the sequence: 'Out Tompions', 'Cast loose your guns', 'Cartridge. Ball. Prime. Run out your gun. Prime. Aim. Stand clear... Fire!!' 
121.        AND AGAIN - DUSK 
As another broadside shakes the deck, STEPHEN hauls his collecting net on board and empties out a glistening array of sea creatures - shrimps, squid and minnows, glinting like opals in the pink light. 
MOWETT (O.S.) Two minutes five, Sir. 
PULLINGS Again! 
122.        AND AGAIN - NIGHT 
It's a race. JACK's orders are just a formality, the sequence having become so automatic now. 
JACK Out Tompions... Run out your guns... Prime. 
Seconds ticking away on MOWETT's stopwatch, barrels float on the sea a hundred yards out. 
JACK (CONT.) (CONT'D) As she bears, from forward aft. Point your guns... Fire!! 
123.   THE OCEAN AT NIGHT 
The black ship spouting tongues of flame, the water around the target barrels erupting in great spouts. 
MOWETT (O.S.) Two minutes dead. 
124.   THE GUNPOWDER ROOM 
Boom! Another splendidly coordinated broadside resounds through the ship as the powder-monkeys come racing down through the dreadnought screens to the magazine and back with more cartridge. 
For them too it's a race, little ADDISON just ahead of SWIFT, RYE hot on his heels. 
125.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT 
The sound of the guns is faint down here, at least when heard from STEPHEN's perspective - his ears are stuffed with wax. 
He is surrounded by his specimen bottles, and he looks from his microscope to his ledger where he is documenting the array of aquatic life-forms. He removes his ear-plugs, but the noise of the guns is deafening and he hastily replaces them. 
126.        ON THE GUN-DECK - NIGHT 
MOWETT watches the second hand of his stopwatch, glancing up as he notes - 
The concentrated fury of the men swabbing, ramming, heaving in, heaving out, firing at a raft this time. 
And he stops the watch as the first gun fires. 
MOWETT One minute forty-nine, Sir! 
His voice is drowned by the firing of the other guns in close succession entirely demolishing the raft, the sound mixing with cheering and the frenzied hammering of Nagel and his mates as the gun-deck partitions are cheerfully re-erected. 
127.        IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT 
The table is dragged back into place and settings laid for dinner. 
JACK enters, his face flushed with victory. 
JACK Killick? Killick there. KILLICK appears. 
JACK (CONT'D) What do you have for us tonight? 
KILLICK Which it's, Soused Hoggs-Face. 
JACK Aah! My favorite. 
128.        MAIN DECK - NIGHT 
The sky a great canopy of stars, the ship racing onwards through the warm night. 
Crew men and the recovering wounded have come up on deck. Now they sit around in groups, supping their grog. Someone produces a jaw-harp, someone else a drum. 
131. QUARTERDECK 
The officers have appeared on deck with their coffee and Stephen raises a hand in acknowledgment. 
132.   IN THE RIGGING - NIGHT 
Midshipmen CALAMY RYE and BOYLE are eating from a bag of broken biscuits ('ships nuts') as they sit perched up in the rigging. 
On seeing JACK, they break into their own song. 
MIDSHIPMEN Our captain was very good to us. He dipped his prick in phosphorus. It shed a light all through the night. And steered us through the Bosphorus. 
133. QUARTERDECK 
JACK pretends not to have heard, but he can't hide his smile. Beside him in a chair sits BLAKENEY, his empty jacket sleeve pinned to his front 'Nelson' style, laughing incredulously at the older boys cheek. 
From somewhere on the forecastle, WARLEY and his top-men start singing. 
TOP-MEN Farewell and adieu you fine Spanish ladies Farewell and adieu to you ladies of Spain... 
The older midshipman, HOLLOM joins in, his fine voice soaring effortlessly over the others, hijacking their roistering ballad and converting it to something much more poignant. 
HOLLOM For we've received orders to sail for Old England. Perhaps we shall never more see you again His singing is appreciated by STEPHEN on the quarterdeck. 
STEPHEN What a wonderfully true voice Mr. Hollom does possess. 
134.        IN THE WAIST - NIGHT 
KILLICK and NAGEL are less than impressed with HOLLOM and sing over him, led by ORRAGE the cook. 
ORRAGE Come all you thoughtless young men, A warning take by me, And never leave your happy homes to sail the raging sea. 
135.        OCEAN - NIGHT 
The Surprise sailing away from us, the chorus drifting across the darkness. 
135a.   OCEAN. DAY 
The colours are changing, from the rich hues of the tropics to the cold muted colours of colder, more southerly climes. 
Still the surprise sails on 
136.        THE GREAT CABIN - DAY 
Fingers trace a course down the east coast of South America. Another, more detailed chart is placed on top of the first. 
ALLEN This one's by Colnett, Sir. He travelled with Captain Cook and carried a pair of Arnott's chronometers. 
JACK finds their position and marks it with pencil. A knock on the door. Officers and crew are now dressed according to the change in climate 
KILLICK Couple of the men to see you, Sir. 
JACK (without looking up) Show them in. The door opens to reveal NAGEL and WARLEY carrying something. 
JACK (CONT'D) What's this? 
A scale model of a ship, 15 inches long, perfect in every detail. Jack takes it, delighted, the name picked out in gold on the stern - Acheron. 
NAGEL It were Warley's idea, Sir. 
WARLEY I thought she were familiar like, then I remembered where I'd seen her - in Boston, during the Peace. 
JACK [   ] In Boston? 
WARLEY (nods) Yes, Sir. She's Yankee built. I seen them working on her, something right strange about her scantlings. Then I seen them balls bounce off her an' I got to thinking. 
NAGEL If you look here, Sir. One side opens up. 
He pulls a side off the model, exposing its construction. 
WARLEY Mister Nagel here done it just like I seen her - a third layer 'tween the outer and inner ribbing - diagonal bracing, see? 
JACK Just like the U.S. Constitution - our 12 pounders couldn't penetrate except at close range. 
He passes the model to ALLEN. 
JACK (CONT'D) Killick. Killick, there. 
KILLICK enters. JACK (CONT'D) An extra ration of rum for these men, from my private store. 
KILLICK (shaking his head) Which I was saving for Saluting Day, Sir. 
JACK Rouse it up, Killick, and a bottle for Mr. ALLEN and me. Let us live whilst we're alive! 
KILLICK goes to get the bottles 
JACK hunkers down to bring his gaze level with the ship, as though studying its tiny occupants. 
JACK Touch wood, Mr. Blakeney. And I fancy she plans to out-run us. Ask Dr. Maturin to join us, he loves a good chase. 
BLAKENEY goes below. Above, the topmen release more sail which is tightened by the men on deck hauling on cables. 
Those not working sit on a row along the windward gunwale, like the crew of an ocean racing yacht, to counterbalance the pull of the sails. 
145.        WEATHER-DECK - DAY 
Their speed is so great green seas are now sweeping the forecastle. A man falls and rolls into the scuppers. 
MOWETT Lifelines fore and aft! 
JACK Speed, Mr. Calamy? 
CALAMY heaves the lead and reads the log line, then shouts back to JACK - 
CALAMY Twelve knots, Sir! 
146.        THE SURPRISE - DAY 
Heeled over under a great press of sail, her copper showing as she clefts the waves. 
147.        FORECASTLE - DAY 
Lined up along the starboard rails, the crew look back at their captain riding the ship like a charioteer, one eye aloft on the creaking topmost spar. 
JEMMY DUCKS We're cracking on, eh? 
FASTER DOUDLE We'll be cracking off presently if he doesn't watch it. 
SLADE No, he knows this ship. He knows what she can take. 
He touches wood, just the same and looks at Joe Plaice who gives a meaningful roll of his eyes. 
Ahead, the bank of storm clouds loom gunmetal grey. 
148.        GREAT CABIN - DAY 
PULLINGS knocks and enters, with an anxious looking MR. LAMB, with whom he has been arguing a point. 
PULLINGS We can just see her topsails. She's made her turn westwards. 
LAMB I can't vouch for the mizzen Sir, not round Cape Horn. JACK I'll not lose her now. Set a course westwards. 
Both men accept this and leave. 
149.        QUARTERDECK (TIMELAPSE) - DAY 
The wind has increased considerably, the deck sloping like the roof of a house, the masts bending like coach-whips. 
PULLINGS and LAMB are looking up at the mizzenmast which is making ominous creaks and groans. 
JACK Mr Hollar, rig preventer backstays. Warps and light hawsers to the mastheads. 
JACK stares ahead to the darkening sky as they move across a switchback landscape of massive rolling waves. 
JACK (CONT'D) Better get below, Mr. Pullings! 
PULLINGS What, Sir? 
JACK (GRINNING) Better get some food in you. Before it turns nasty. 
150.        OCEAN - DAY 
Wide to see the two ships. The Surprise and the Acheron with a mile of sea between them. It's like some great ocean race, with neither prepared to take in canvas despite the appalling conditions. 
151.        QUARTERDECK - LATER, DAY 
They are running fast before a dangerous, following sea: a landscape of hills and valleys, the whole thing in terrifying motion. 
The forecastle now vanishes in foam with every plunge, rising each time with water pouring over the waist and spouting from her scuppers. 
KILLICK comes up with the coffee pot inside his jacket. JACK drinks from the spout, peering ahead into the murk. A wild unruly part of him is loving this. 
Above him, more top-men struggle up the rigging, with the mast drawing crazy figure of eights on a rushing sky. 
152.   BELOW DECKS 
The dog watch are wolfing their food, mugs and dinner plates sliding over the table. Crewmen walk up hill to the grog barrel, down their ration and head up top again. 
HIGGINS You reckon Captain will keep chasing him 'round the Horn with every stitch of canvas flying? 
DAVIES I reckon he'd chase him to the gates of hell if he has to. 
PLAICE And that's where we're all going if he doesn't take in sail. 
Since his injury, Joe Plaice's startlingly random pronouncements have acquired the quality of an oracle. 
KILLICK and BLACK BILL. 
KILLICK He's been at it again. 
BLACK BILL Who's that then? 
KILLICK The Jonah. 
BLACK BILL What Jonah? 
160.        THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT 
JACK sits at his desk. The model of the Acheron that WARLEY helped make sits accusingly in front of him. 
STEPHEN pours him a glass on wine, and one for himself. 
STEPHEN The deaths in actual battle are the easiest. (beat) For my own part - those who die under the knife or from some consequent infection: I have to remind myself that it is the enemy who killed them, and not me. (beat) Warley was a casualty of war, as surely as if a French ball had taken him. 
JACK nods. Obviously the death still weighs on his conscience. [ ] 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) (offering the wine) At the same time.... 
He breaks off 
Jack At the same time, what? 
Stephen hesitates, aware that he has to proceed carefully 
STEPHEN You know that I wear two hats on every voyage. I am the captains particular friend and supporter, but also I am the ships doctor in which later capacity I am party to.... 
He catches a steely glint in Jacks eye and breaks off. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) 
You don't want me to continue. 
JACK (stiffly) On the contrary. I insist on it. 
STEPHEN There is talk below decks of turning back. Or rather that we should have turned back some weeks ago. Of course the men would follow "Lucky Jack" anywhere, and usually in the confident expectation of victory. But that of course is the problem. 
JACK What is the problem? 
STEPHEN That you are not accustomed to defeat Jack. That you have taken it too personally. That chasing this larger, faster ship, with its long guns, is beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth before destruction'? 
JACK It's not pride nor anything like it, it's a question of duty. 
STEPHEN 'Duty', ah yes. The naval signal for end of discussion. 
JACK You can be as 'satiric' as you like, Stephen, but I have my orders. She is attacking our whalers. For why? Without whales we have no boot polish, nor any soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil our sabres and muskets. Destroying our whalers could win the war for Napoleon. Which is why we must catch this Acheron. As a man of learning surely you can see that. 
STEPHEN At whatever the cost? 
JACK Any whatever cost I choose to pay. And I will calculate that myself, Stephen without reference to your friends in the ward room. 
160A MIZZEN-TOP 
An icy wind whips at the men working on the temporary mizzen mast. 
Hollom, half way up the rigging is relaying instructions between the men in the rigging and the men on deck 
HOLLOM Cast off. 
The new yard flails around on its pulley, bashing dangerously against the mast. Almost claiming Nagel 
HOLLOM (CONT'D) Belay. Sorry. Sorry. 161    QUARTERDECK 
PULLING craning upwards. The topmen's shouted commands are whipped away by the gale. 
JACK joins him, still smarting from the conversation with Stephen 
JACK We'll have to go further south, get around this bloody west wind. 
PULLINGS How far south? 
JACK As far as is necessary, Mr. Pullings. The sixtieth parallel if need be. 
162.        THE SHIP - DAY 
Tacking southwards. The sun, a pale anaemic disc, gradually disappearing behind layers of cloud. 
The wind is a constant shrill whistle through the rigging, a sound like some infernal drill which rises and falls but never ceases. 
DISSOLVE TO - 
163.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN 
The sun rising in a clear sky which turns a sapphire blue. White ice-islands lie all around them, some a pure, rosy pink. Others bright ultramarine. 
HOLLOM sees them looking at him. 
170.        THE SCUTTLEBUTT, SHIP'S WAIST - DAY 
A marine sentry, TROLLOPE, stands guard by the ship's water- barrel - the level is very low. STEPHEN ladles some water into a phial. TROLLOPE One glass per man, sir, Captain's orders. 
STEPHEN straightening, irritated by the challenge. 
STEPHEN A mere thimbleful, Corporal, for scientific purposes only. 
171.         STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAY 
In the gloom of his cabin, STEPHEN angles the mirror of his brass microscope toward the window, and places a slide containing a droplet of water under the lens. 
172.         MAINMAST-TOP - DAY 
JACK climbs into the top. He adjusts his telescope, studies the horizon. 
173.   JACK'S TELESCOPE P.O.V. 
He pans across the empty sea. 
174.   STEPHEN'S MICROSCOPE P.O.V. 
An assortment of mobile, transparent micro-organisms rotating wildly. 
STEPHEN (O.S.) My God, Padeen, a veritable zoo. 
PADEEN takes a look, amazed then greatly amused. 
175.         THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT 
Charts are spread all over the table, STEPHEN poring over them when Jack comes in 
STEPHEN Show me where these Doldrums lie? 
JACK joins him. 
JACK Stephen. Will we never make a sailor of you? The doldrums is a condition, not a region. But you tend to strike 'em here... (pointing) ...between the trades, and the sou'easterlies. I hope the Acheron is having it as bad as we are. 
STEPHEN considers their current position on the chart, the tiny Galapagos Islands to the north and the vast emptiness to the west of them. 
STEPHEN Assuming he is heading for the Galapagos, and not some other point in all this vastness? 
JACK Come. I'd have thought you'd be delighted to go there. It is said to be a natural paradise 
STEPHEN In truth I'd be delighted with the merest guano stained rock provided it didn't sway beneath my feet 
JACK Well, we'll take on food and water once we're there, and as compensation for not having put ashore in Brazil I pledge that during that time, several days at least, you can wander at will, catching bugs and beetles to your heart's delight. You will be the first naturalist to set foot on the islands. That is my solemn promise 
STEPHEN I accept, provided the men have not mutinied and thrown us all overboard before we get there. 
JACK Mutiny? No. They are already counting their share of the prize money. 
STEPHEN Another week of this and they shall gladly give it up for a glass of clean water. 
JACK Ach, Stephen. Stephen. Pray stop your bellyacheing. We shall have rain presently, and if not we shall damned well tow ourselves out of this. 
176.        JOLLY BOAT - DAY 
Disgruntled, under-slept men, in boats towing the ship. 
NAGEL and DAVIES look back darkly at HOLLOM who sits in the stern. 
HOLLOM Stroke. Stroke... 
DAVIES (whispers) I heard he were on the Fair Marion as foundered off Tresco. And he were on the Zephyrus what exploded at Trafalgar. 
HOLLOM has heard this, as DAVIES intended, but he looks away choosing to ignore them. 
177.        FIGHTING TOP - DAY 
A view from above of men towing the ship. Over this an unpleasant scraping sound - chalk on slate. 
BONDEN M-a-s-t... mast 
STEPHEN is writing words on a slate then offering them to BONDEN whom he is teaching to read. 
BONDEN (CONT'D) S-u-n... sun 
STEPHEN nods and scratches another word on the board. As BONDEN struggles to decipher it there's the sound of a musket shot and a seabird falls out of the sky. 
HOWARD, the captain of marines, reloads his smoking musket laughing aloud. 
STEPHEN Is that man completely mad? (shouts down) Mr. Howard, a petrel is not good eating! 
HOWARD looks up towards them, a broad smile on his red moon of a face. 
JACK (untypically cutting) The enemy cannot come on us without a wind, Mr. Mowett. 
He looks about at the terrified faces of the crew. The wailing sound now rises to a shriek, as STEPHEN joins the group. 
JACK (CONT'D) What do you make of it, Doctor? 
STEPHEN I'm sure I've never heard the like. 
The crew overhear this and pass it among themselves as another anguished howl fills the night. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) Perhaps it's the mother of the creature Mr. Howard shot. 
JACK [    ] Creature? 
STEPHEN [ ] A manatee. A sea-elephant possibly. Though I have never known one with a cry like this. 
A glance along at HOWARD on the gangway, as terrified as anyone. 
JACK Bosun. Fire off some flares. 
195.        WIDE ON THE SHIP - NIGHT 
Three flares soar and burst with a ghostly glow, making a pool of blue light around the ship, the sound continuing to echo and re-echo from somewhere beyond. 
196.        QUARTERDECK - NIGHT 
The light illuminates the half-hour glass, its top-half empty of sand. Like everyone else, the duty sergeant stands frozen to the spot. Jack rounds on him. 
JACK Sergeant, what the devil are you thinking of? Turn the glass and strike the bell. 
Roused, the duty sergeant turns the glass and time resumes its flow. 
Two bells are hesitantly rung and the crew regain the power of motion, their limbs still spastic with fear. And when the sound comes once more they all freeze. 
JACK joins MOWETT at the taffrail. The thing is somewhere out there, whatever it is. 
MOWETT Perhaps some poor shipwreck? 
He shouts, a slight nervous catch to his voice. 
MOWETT (CONT'D) Ahoy! Is anyone there? 
Part of him knows it's crazy and of course there's no reply. The sound constantly shifting position, now in the water, now in the sky. 
JACK turns to see a white face, frighteningly close to his own. It's PADEEN, mouth agape, face unnaturally white, staring into the gloom as though drawn to whatever horror lies out there. JACK Padeen. What are you doing on the quarterdeck? 
He looks down at the press of men who have gathered at the bottom of the ladder, some with weapons. 
JACK (CONT'D) Below! All of you men below! (to MOWETT) Tell the bosun those off-duty may sleep with their lamps on. 
197.        LOWER DECK - NIGHT 
Several crewmen huddle close together their faces lit by a battle-lantern. Joe Plaice grim. Doudle wide-eyed. Higgins with his alcoholic tremor more pronounced than ever. 
BLACK BILL Duppies make that noise. 
KILLICK (indicating BILL) See. They know all about this in Africa. 
DOUDLE What's a duppie? 
BLACK BILL That Warley. Swallow by a fish. Spirit can't get out. Him duppie now. 
SLADE Captain don't even know what that noise be. 
General nods of agreement. 
DOUDLE Doctor neither, and he knows everything. 
KILLICK Joe here's got the most experience in these matters, and new brains to boot, let's hear it from Joe. 
All eyes on JOE PLAICE. He speaks from the shadows. 
PLAICE It's the Jonah causing it. That howling thing is a signal to the Phantom-Ship. He's calling it up, don't you see? Every time he's on watch the ship appears. You wait and see, the ghost-ship will appear any time tonight, and take us all straight to the hot-place. 
Another shriek, closer now, seems to confirm JOE's bizarre theory. 
198.        MIDSHIPMEN'S BERTH - NIGHT 
The boys sit together. None of them look at HOLLOM, who sits pale and wretched in a corner of the room, clutching his stomach. 
199.        STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT 
As the howling continues, STEPHEN looks through a number of books on sea-creatures searching for a reference to what they're experiencing. 
As JACK looks over his shoulder, his eye is caught by a picture in one of STEPHEN's books. 
He picks it up. 
LOOKOUT (O.S.) Land-ho! 
207.        GANGWAY - DAY 
BLAKENEY runs along the gangway, past STEPHEN, en route to the quarterdeck. 
BLAKENEY Give you joy, sir! We have raised the Galapagos! 
208.     MONTAGE oF TELESCOPE VIEWS, GALAPAGOS - DAY 
There's a primeval quality to the landscape, a feeling of a world just born. The wild creatures that inhabit the lava flows and coral beaches confirm this - the giant tortoises, iguanas, sea-lions and penguins, a teeming profusion of exotic animals and plants. 209.        QUARTERDECK/FORECASTLE/TOPS - DAY 
The ship fairly bristles with telescopes. 
210.   FORECASTLE 
A small group of familiar faces share a pocket telescope. 
HIGGINS (looking) Can't see any wimmun. Just lots of ducks and lizards. 
DOUDLE takes the telescope. 
DOUDLE Wot? There must be wimmun. T'ain't natural. 
211.   QUARTERDECK 
STEPHEN and BLAKENEY side by side. From both their faces we sense their wonder at seeing these remarkable creatures for the first time. 
STEPHEN How extraordinary. 
BLAKENEY What, sir? 
STEPHEN Those birds! 
He's looking at a group of unremarkable black seabirds waddling about on a rock, flapping short, stumpy wings. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) A species of cormorant. But apparently flightless, by all that's Holy. I believe that is unknown to science. 
BLAKENEY dwells briefly on the strange rock-climbing birds then drifts back to the iguanas. 
BLAKENEY The dragons don't seem to bother 'em. 
STEPHEN They are a type of iguana I should think, and therefore vegetarian. His telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. BLAKENEY is wholly absorbed in the iguanas. 
BLAKENEY Will you catch one? 
STEPHEN Yes. Most certainly. And if we can, some eggs. 
BLAKENEY I mean the great lizards. 
STEPHEN Oh! 
Recognizing how superficially dull the birds are to BLAKENEY's untutored eye, by contrast with giant lizards. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) I should think a pair of them. Then you can present one of their offspring to the king. 
BONDEN Ha! There's one going for a swim. 
STEPHEN No. Iguanas are land animals. 
BONDEN Not these ones. 
The prehistoric-looking creatures, as if suddenly awakened, begin diving into the water. 
STEPHEN (O.S.) By Jove Bonden you are right! Two new species in as many minutes. 
He breaks off, suddenly aware of a shouted exchange between the lookout and the quarterdeck. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) What is all that confounded bellowing? 
JACK All hands about ship! 
BLAKENEY dashes off and STEPHEN is elbowed out of the way by hands rushing to get at the sails. 
NEHEMIAH SLADE By your leave sir, by your leave. 
HOLLAR (distant) Helms a'lee - off tacks and sheets - mainsail haul! 
As the ship turns a distant whaleboat appears with six men aboard, pulling out from one of the neighboring islands. 
212.        IN THE LEE OF THE SHIP'S HULL (TIME-LAPSE) - DAY 
The whaleboat has come alongside. 
Men swarm down the boarding nets and the whalers are helped aboard, hoarse and exhausted from rowing and shouting. 
HOGG God bless you. Thank you, shipmates. 
STEPHEN I'm sure of it. 
BLAKENEY Were you to have walked all day on the island, you might never have come across it. 
STEPHEN That is more than likely, sure. 
BLAKENEY passes it to STEPHEN. 
BLAKENEY You can have it. 
STEPHEN Thank you, Mr. Blakeney. 
BLAKENEY hovers for a moment, unsure of further conversation, then retreats. 
216       IN THE GREAT CABIN - NIGHT 
JACK sits alone at the table. KILLICK enters with toasted cheese for two. 
KILLICK No music? That's a shame 
He sets down the toasted cheese. 
KILLICK (CONT'D) I'll just leave the one plate then, if himself won't be joining. 
JACK Yes, Killick. Just the one. 
JACK cuts himself a portion, scowling at STEPHEN's cello which seems to watch him reproachfully as he eats. 
217.      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT 
STEPHEN takes a dropper, carefully measures twenty drops of laudanum to a glass of water, and drinks. 218.        LOOKOUT - DAY 
The lookout leaning out from the cross-trees. 
DOUDLE (shouting) On deck there. Object fine on the starboard bow. 
219.        THE SHIP LYING STATIONARY - DAY 
A barrel is being lifted aboard from the skiff and passed up the side of the ship. 
220.   IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP 
JACK comes down, accompanied by ALLEN, the acknowledged expert in these matters. 
Others gather round, including HOGG the whaler, inspecting the stencilled markings. 
ALLEN Martha's vineyard. 
HOGG No, this here's from Boston. I was married there once. 
ALLEN Any road, it's a Yankee barrel. 
HOGG What they call a Bedford Hog in New England. 
MOWETT (to JACK) The Acheron touched at Boston. 
HOGG And it's not been in the water more than a week. 
ALLEN One can't say with any accuracy but... 
HOGG Yes you can. There's no sea chummer on it, and the dowels is sound. 
221.        ON THE QUARTERDECK - DAY JACK returns to his post. 
JACK Continue due west, Mr. Bonden. 
TOM PULLINGS watches him. There has been a change amongst the officers and crew toward JACK. His relentless driving after the Acheron has reached the point of obsession, an obsession not shared by his exhausted men. 
He is a lonely, haunted figure as he now steps up on the gunwale, one hand on the ratlines, scanning the empty sea, sensing his enemy is out there, just beyond the curve of the earth. 
DISSOLVE TO - 
222.        LADDER (TIME LAPSE) - DAY 
A wild wind humming through the rigging as STEPHEN goes topside. 
223.        FORECASTLE - DAY 
He finds various hands making the boats secure. 
PLAICE Have you seen the bird, doctor? 
STEPHEN I have not - no bird these many days. What kind of a bird? 
PLAICE A sort of albatross I believe, or perhaps a prodigious great mew. He has been following the ship since... there he is, crossing our wake! 
224.        ON THE GANGWAY - DAY 
230.        INTERIOR STEPHEN'S CABIN - DAWN 
Early morning light on the interior of the cabin. PADEEN is asleep, holding a Bible, in the doctor's chair. 
STEPHEN himself lies motionless with his eyes closed and his mouth open, no colour in his face. 
The sea is relatively calm. From outside the sound of the bosun's orders, over rattling blocks and pulleys. HOLLAR (O.S.) ...Clap on now! Every rope an end... Jolly-boat away... Slowly, Jenks! You grass-combing lubber! 
MOWETT comes in, sees STEPHEN, and takes him for dead. 
MOWETT (shouts outside) Davies! Slade! 
Two big men come in behind him. PADEEN wakes, confused and pushes them away, moving protectively to the doctor's side. 
The commotion disturbs STEPHEN. His eyes open. Like a dead man just come back to life. 
MOWETT (CONT'D) Doctor. You're still with us. Can we move you onto a stretcher? 
STEPHEN swallows uncomfortably and tries to make sense of things. 
231.        A GALAPAGOS ISLAND - DAY 
A giant iguana watches as a small procession trudges up the stony beach. 
At its head, STEPHEN is carried in a litter up to where a tent has been set up above the high-water mark. 
His P.O.V. as JACK appears in the blue sky above him. 
STEPHEN Tell me this wasn't on my account? 
JACK (dead pan) No. It was because of Higgins. (beat) Can't have him poking around in your belly without a solid platform to work on. 
He ducks as they enter - 
232.        THE HOSPITAL TENT - DAY 
In the creamy light, they lay STEPHEN down on a recently- constructed wooden operating table. 
HIGGINS squats on the ground, rummaging through various large sharp surgical instruments which he has emptied onto a piece of Hessian. 
JACK All set, Higgins? 
STEPHEN grabs JACK's sleeve. 
STEPHEN Not Higgins. I do this with my own hand. 
Jack frowns, unsure what he means by this. 
EXT. THE TENT - NIGHT 
PADEEN stands, arms crossed at the closed tent-flap, keeping at bay a crowd of well-wishers, and the merely curious. 
INT. THE TENT - NIGHT 
STEPHEN sits pale and sweaty, propped up on a series of chests, his back against a coil of rope. In front of him, suspended by pulleys, LAMB and NAGEL have set up a large gilt-framed mirror. 
Beside him, on a white tablecloth, some small scissors and scalpels. 
STEPHEN (To Jack) [ ] You are sure you have a head and a stomach for this kind of thing? 
JACK (smiles) My dear Doctor, I have seen blood and wounds since I was a little boy. 
STEPHEN Then hold my belly, pressing firmly when I give the word. 
STEPHEN begins first with the knife, then the probe - the grind of metal on living bone. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) You will have to raise the rib, Higgins. Take a good grip with the square retractor. Up. Harder, harder. (to himself) Snip the cartilage. 
The metallic clash of instruments, perpetual swabbing. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) Now, Jack, a steady downward pressure. Good. Keep it so. Give me the davier. Swab, Higgins. Press, Jack, press. 
JACK closes his eyes. STEPHEN draws in his breath, arches his back, and it's done. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) There she is. 
He pulls out the bullet, and with it, a fragment of his shirt. 
STEPHEN (CONT'D) Is that all of it? 
The bloody piece of shirt is handed to HIGGINS who matches it to the hole in STEPHEN's old shirt. 
HIGGINS Aye, she'll patch up nicely, sir. 
STEPHEN Easy away, Jack. Handsomely with the retractor. Higgins, look to the Captain, while I swab. 
HIGGINS helps JACK into a chair, pressing his head down between his knees. After a moment, and a few deep breaths, JACK looks up. STEPHEN smiles at him. A hint of surly triumph. 
240.        LAVA BEDS - DAY 
STEPHEN with his telescope taking notes on bird-life. 
241.        LOW SCRUB - DAY 
The huge, strangely balletic figure of PADEEN chasing after a butterfly in evening light. 
242.        A HEADLAND - DAY 
Wide to see another aspect of the countryside - a hint of distant sea, a rocky headland rising from the plain. 
The group is widely scattered. STEPHEN at the base of the headland, BLAKENEY half a mile further inland. PADEEN coming up slowly behind, laden with the fruits of their expedition. 
243.        BASE OF THE HEADLAND - DAY 
STEPHEN rests a moment. Some stones rattle down from the hillside. He looks up to see a flash of black feathers near the crest - the cormorant. 
On his shirt a red smudge has appeared. His wound has begun to bleed again. 
Ignoring this, Stephen pushes on after his quarry. 
244.   THE ROCKY SLOPE 
Near the top, STEPHEN pauses to catch his breath and glances above him. 
Again the bird, moving higher, as if leading him on. 
STEPHEN gets down on all fours, crawling cautiously to the crest just above him. 245.   TOP OF THE HEADLAND 
A clearing. There is movement in the bushes. 
STEPHEN slowly rises, climbs the few paces to the hilltop and enters a clearing. 
He searches amongst the bushes. Nothing. 
He turns and looks back down the hillside to see BLAKENEY and PADEEN far below, then sits to get his breath back again. 
STEPHEN'S P.O.V: on the ground between his feet, a beetle. He picks it up. 
Close, on his hand. It is the same type of beetle BLAKENEY gave him aboard the Surprise. 
Smiling at the coincidence STEPHEN raises the tiny creature to eye level. 
His P.O.V.: the beetle, the creature in sharp focus, behind it the sea, and on the sea, a black shape. 
The focus shifts to the background - a ship at anchor in a bay. 
The beetle flies away as STEPHEN stares out at the ship. It's the Acheron, and they are weighing anchor. 
246.         COUNTRYSIDE - DUSK 
BLAKENEY urging STEPHEN to hurry as they make their way through the darkening landscape. All kinds of creatures are appearing around them, and every few yards STEPHEN pauses to examine something. 
BLAKENEY Sir, you must hurry! 
STEPHEN A moment! You're a worse tyrant than any ship's captain. 
He's breathing hard, exhausted. 
BLAKENEY You must carry him, Padeen! 
PADEEN looks at the collection of baskets he carries. BLAKENEY (CONT'D) Leave them! We must get back to the ship. 
STEPHEN raises his hand in protest, but BLAKENEY is already divesting PADEEN of his load. 
247.        COUNTRYSIDE - LAST LIGHT 
PADEEN carrying STEPHEN 'piggy-back', BLAKENEY out ahead urging them on. 
247a   THE DISCARDED COLLECTING BOXES 
A variety of small bugs and animals crawling free 
248      STEPHEN'S CABIN - NIGHT 
STEPHEN gingerly lowers himself into his 'elbow-chair', gripping the table and BLAKENEY's good arm for support. Sighing, he begins emptying his pockets of various small items collected during the day - some leaves, rocks and insects - and places them in ordered piles around his microscope. 
All about them can be heard the urgent sounds of departure - the anchor rattling up, shouted orders and the drumming of bare feet on the deck above. 
He holds up a stick in a specimen-jar, and is examining it with his magnifying glass when JACK enters. 
JACK I forgot to ask you - did you see your bird? 
STEPHEN's eye grossly enlarged through the lens. 
STEPHEN I did not. My greatest discovery was your phantom. 
A bemused STEPHEN looks about him as he approaches JACK. 
STEPHEN I see. A wolf in sheep in sheep's clothing 
JACK A phasmid, doctor. It was you what gave me the idea. 
STEPHEN I'm not sure a phasmid can be a predator. 
JACK No? Well this one is. 
253.        BERTH DECK - DAWN HOWARD and his marines change out of their smart uniforms, into the oldest most ragged clothes on board the ship, much to the amusement of the passing sailors. 
CREW MEN AD LIB Very fancy. Blue to match your eyes. Is there a skirt comes with it? 
254.        GUN-DECK - DAWN 
Men are checking the breechings of the great guns and chipping cannonballs to make them more perfectly spherical, more deadly. 
The armourer is at his grindstone sending out showers of sparks, a group of seamen round him relaying one another at the crank, stacking newly honed cutlasses and boarding axes at their feet. 
Another team check and load pistols by the score. 
254.        MIDSHIPMEN'S QUARTERS - DAWN 
Alone, BLAKENEY awkwardly draws his dirk, left-handed from its scabbard. It glints momentarily in the lamp-light. 
CALAMY enters, face aglow, abruptly trying to cover his joy when he sees BLAKENEY. 
BLAKENEY [ ] It's all right. Permission to boast. You're to lead the boarders from the forecastle. Congratulations. 
CALAMY Thank you. 
BLAKENEY You'll make lieutenant out of this. 
The others come in. 
BOYLE He already has. 'Acting' 3rd Lieutenant Peter Calamy. 
Oohs and aahs from all. 
BLAKENEY Then I'll see you at the forecastle, 'Lieutenant'. 
CALAMY That's not your station. 
BLAKENEY looks from CALAMY to the others, who avoid his eye. 
BLAKENEY But naturally I'll board with you? 
CALAMY I'm sorry, Will. Captain's orders. 
BLAKENEY is devastated. 
Rye bursts in, in a state of high excitement. 
RYE She's seen us! 
256.        QUARTERDECK - DAWN 
JACK raises his glass, focuses on the Acheron, plainly visible in the distance, with a line of signal flags running up her backstay. 
MOWETT She's asking us to heave to. Shall I give the order? 
JACK No, make a show of fleeing upwind, but panicky and disorganized, like a whaler might do. 
Allen smiles at this unintended slight 
JACK (CONT'D) No offence, Mr. Hogg. 
257.        WIDE ON THE SHIPS - DAY 
A show of chaos on deck as the Surprise veers upwind, away from the Acheron. As she presents her stern we see her new name: Malacca. 
258.        QUARTERDECK OF THE SURPRISE - DAY 
Through his telescope, JACK looks back at the Acheron in pursuit, a dark figure on her foredeck. JACK (to Mowett) Run up Portuguese colours. (then down to the gun-deck) Load, Mr. Pullings. Triple shot 'em. 
BLAKENEY comes onto the quarterdeck and salutes, looking flushed and angry. 
BLAKENEY May I speak with you, Sir. 
JACK No saluting, Mr. Blakeney, we're whalers here. 
BLAKENEY Mr. Calamy says I am not in the boarding party, I wanted to say - 
JACK (interrupts) I know what you want to say and my answer is no. I promised your mother I would return you in one piece and I have already failed her on that score. You will command a gun and then retire to defend the quarterdeck here with Dr. Maturin. 
BLAKENEY But sir - 
....and spins the wheel hard to starboard. 
266.   THE SURPRISE 
Wide, to see her swinging broadside on, across the path of the oncoming Acheron. 
267.   POV ACHERON DAY 
Confused shouts from the enemy's deck, chaos on her forecastle, somewhere a drum beating. 
268 + 269.    DELETED 
270.   THE SURPRISE QUARTERDECK - DAY 
JACK hands the wheel to BONDEN. 
JACK Run us down her larboard side then cut across her wake! (shouts down to the gun deck) Hold fire Mr Pullings! Hold till we're broadside on! 
271. - THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON 
Wide, to see the Surprise turning downwind, back towards the Acheron, so they will pass broadside to broadside [   ] no more than thirty yards apart. 
272. QUARTERDECK/ GUN-DECK, SURPRISE 
Through a furious exchange of musket fire JACK runs down the ladder to the gun-deck- 
JACK Fire as she bears! Every gun to concentrate on her mainmast! 
Through the gunports the Acheron's great hull becomes visible. Some of the Acheron's guns have run out, but the crews are unprepared and disorganized. PULLINGS On the uproll! Fire for the mainmast as you sight her! 
As the Surprise rolls and the upper deck of the Acheron becomes visible. 
273. THE SURPRISE GUNS 
Barking, leaping back one by one, great tongues of flame spitting from their barrels, dense clouds of smoke rising. 
274.    VIEW OF THE ACHERON 
With an almighty splitting sound their mainmast falls, dragging yards and rigging with it, the whole mass falling over their side, obscuring many of their gun-ports. 
275. GUNDECK/QUARTERDECK, SURPRISE - 
Cheers from the crew. Jack yelling up the companionway 
JACK Now Mr Bonden! Hard a'starboard! 
276.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON 
The Acheron wallows, bought to a standstill by the enormous dragging weight of their mainmast. 
BONDEN wheels the ship across the enemy's wake, past the exposed, vulnerable stern. 
277.    DELETED 
277A.   GUNDECK, SURPRISE 
JACK Fire at will! 
278.    GUN-DECK, SURPRISE 
In random sequence the Surprise's gunners pound it into the Acheron's stern. Casement windows vanish in a cloud of wood and glass, exposing the Acheron's terrified gun-crews, now open to devastating fire as the Surprise glides past. 
279.    QUARTERDECK 
JACK climbs up on the gunwales, shouting to BONDEN - JACK Lay me alongside! 
280.    THE SURPRISE AND THE ACHERON 
The bow of the Surprise lurches into the Acheron mid-ships, spars interlocking, the Surprise guns firing into her at point-blank range. 
The crew throw grappling hooks. 
281..   QUARTERDECK 
JACK Boarders away! 
And he leaps to the enemy deck, a great tide of men following after him. 
282.    FORECASTLE 
CALAMY leads his own children's crusade from the bows and forecastle: youthful but terrifying, screaming and swinging their blades. 
283.    QUARTERDECK 
An agonized BLAKENEY watches from where he stands beside STEPHEN. JOE PLAICE is close by with some of the older men, ready to ferry the wounded below. 
284.    ON THE ACHERON

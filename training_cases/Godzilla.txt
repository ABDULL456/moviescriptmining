First Draft 2/19/96 
FADE IN: 
An iguana... 
Crawling off its nest, leaving its eggs exposed. 
1  EXT. MORUROA ATOLL ISLANDS, FRENCH POLYNESIA - PACIFIC       1 
Grainy, Kodak color, nineteen sixties documentary footage of a beautiful Polynesian island. We SEE quick shots of Kimono Dragons, Gila Monsters and Chameleons all in their natural tropical environment. 
Super: Moruro Atoll Islands, French Polynesia - June 
Incongruously over this jungle environment we HEAR a static ridden radio filtered VOICE, slowly counting down in French. It is almost as through the reptiles of the island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously move about. 
Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky. 
We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the French government held in this tropical region. 
Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One building after the next, accelerating in momentum, culminating in one final EXPLOSION. 
The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands below. 
We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile, unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the lizard's eggs. 
Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash. WE continue to push in, getting closer...closer... 
SMASH CUT TO: 
2  EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - OIL TANKER - RAINSTORM - NIGHT          2 
Smashing through the choppy waters, barely by the storm we SEE the CORI AKIDO, a Japanese oil supertanker. 
Super: Pacific Ocean, present day 
3  INT. CORI AKIDO - BRIDGE - NIGHT                             3 
We TRACK across the complicated computerized navigational console that is actually steering the immense ship. In the b.g. we HEAR a Japanese t.v. program playing. 
At the end of the console is the ship's SKIPPER, an overweight Japanese seaman sleepily watches a snowy satellite broadcast of a Sumo wrestling match. 
Suddenly the SONAR blares out a warning ALARM. Startled, the Skipper awakes and stumbles out of his chair over to the console. 
The SONAR displays an enormous MASS heading quickly toward the ship. The Skipper's eyes go wide. He hits a KLAXON alarm, awaking the entire ship. He presses the radio/intercom. 
SKIPPER (in Japanese) Captain. This is the bridge. We have an emergency. 
4  INT. SUPERTANKER'S HALLWAYS - SAME - NIGHT                   4 
Alarms BLARING. The crew rushes out of their quarters and into the hall. Quickly they race for the upper decks. 
5  INT. OTHER HALLWAY - BY KITCHEN                              5 
The ship's elderly COOK pokes his head out of the kitchen and yells at some of the crew as they pass by. 
COOK (in Japanese) What's going on? What's happening? 
Before anyone can answer, the ship is ROCKED by an enormous THUD as something hits the side of the immense ship. The crew TUMBLES as the ship SWAYS VIOLENTLY. 
The old Cook is thrown to the floor. He looks up nervously. 
6  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   6 
The CAPTAIN enters quickly, joining the Skipper at the console. 
CAPTAIN (in Japanese) What was that!? 
SKIPPER (in Japanese) I can't tell... 
Again, the ship is HIT. An enormous CRASHING SOUND is HEARD as the ship ROCKS to one side, tossing the Captain and Skipper to the floor. 
Suddenly we HEAR the tell-tale, famous SCREAMING WAIL of our creature from somewhere outside. Terror shines in the Captain's eyes at the sound. 
7  INT. HALLWAYS - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                           7 
The crew, getting back on their feet, reacts to the horrible WAILING SOUND. 
Suddenly the ship is HIT AGAIN. This time something enormous RIPS THROUGH THE HULL, crushing one of the crew members as it TEARS THROUGH THE WALLS. 
Water RUSHES THROUGH the large gaping hole, quickly filling the hallway. The Cook and what's left of the crew scurry for the stairs, as the water level chases them. 
8  INT. BRIDGE - SAME - NIGHT                                   8 
The ship's computers are WHIRLING with warning lights and alarms. As the Skipper tries to adjust the controls in vain, the Captain grabs the ship's p.a. system. 
CAPTAIN (in Japanese) Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Man the lifeboats... 
But before he can say anything more, something WHIPS across the bridge's enormous windshield, SHATTERING THE GLASS. Was it a tail? No way, far too big. 
9  EXT. SHIP'S DECK - SAME - NIGHT                              9 
A gigantic path cut through the jungle. 
Something of immense size has trampled and cut a deep and wide path right through the jungle forest that goes on for miles on end. Over the stunned face of Nick we HEAR... 
OLD COOK (O.S.) (filtered) ...Gojira...Gojira...Gojira... 
CUT TO: 
T.V. MONITOR - JUNGLE FOOTAGE 
The same beach scene we saw when Nick arrived. Over it... 
REPORTER (filtered) ...American and Panamanian troops quarantined off a section of the Panamanian jungle today amid unconfirmed reports of a crashed Air Force jet... 
WIDEN TO REVEAL: 
19  INT. WNEW T.V. STATION - DAY                                19 
As we WIDEN we see this is one of several wall mounted monitors all showing channel WNEW. Through the glass doorway nearby we see CHARLES CAIMAN, 40's, handsome, entering the office. 
AUDREY (O.S.) Murray wants these copied to each field producer... 
ANGLE - SECRETARY DESK 
Standing in front of the desk is AUDREY TIMMONDS, early thirties, attractive, small town girl who still hasn't toughened in the big city and talking with her co-worker, LUCY, sitting. 
AUDREY And I'm supposed to remind you to call him on all of Caiman's expense p.o.'s. 
LUCY Speak of the devil. 
Just then Caiman passes behind them. 
AUDREY (nervous) Think I should ask him? I'm going to ask him. You think I should? I will. 
Audrey makes the decision and bolts after Caiman. Lucy rolls her eyes. 
LUCY Oh girl... 
ANGLE - CAIMAN 
As he walks towards his office Audrey races up to him. Seeing her, he walks faster hoping to avoid her. He can't. 
AUDREY Did you talk with Humphries? 
CAIMAN This is not the place... 
AUDREY Just tell me, did you talk with him? 
CAIMAN He said he'd consider it. It's between you and Rodriguez. 
AUDREY Are you serious? He's going to consider me for he job? What else did he say? 
They arrive at his office. An enormous standee of himself with the ACTION NEWS CREW is there. 
CAIMAN Why don't I tell you over dinner tonight? Your place. 
He stops at his door. Audrey is startled. 
AUDREY Mr. Caiman, you're married. 
CAIMAN And you're beautiful... 
AUDREY Mr. Caiman... 
CAIMAN Call me Charlie. 
AUDREY (stubbornly) Mr. Caiman, I've been doing extra research for you after hours and weekends for nearly a year. And I've never asked for anything but this job is really important to me. I'm too old to be an assistant anymore. I need to know this job is going someplace. 
CAIMAN So have dinner with me tonight. 
AUDREY I can't. 
CAIMAN It's your choice. 
Caiman shuts the door on her. She turns and is face to face with the standee of Caiman. She takes out her chewing gum and plasters it on his nose. 
CUT TO: 
20  EXT. JAMAICAN HIGHWAY - AERIAL SHOT - DAY                   20 
Over the bumpy Jamaican highway we FOLLOW from above several military jeeps racing in convoy. 
Super: Great Pedro Bluff, Jamaica 
21  INT. JEEP - SAME                                            21 
Elsie, Nick and Clive are cramped together along with Nick's equipment in the back of the jeep. Nick looks very uncomfortable. Elsie looks at Nick...lasciviously. 
ELSIE Three years digging up worms in Chernobyl? How did Mrs. Tatopoulos handle it? 
NICK Oh, I'm not married. 
ELSIE Really? A girlfriend then? 
NICK No. Perhaps I work too much. 
ELSIE (filtered) You mean to tell me that there is no one who holds a special place in your heart? 
Nick seems to get lost in thought. 
LEONARD and his 1st MATE are puzzled by the engine WHINE of their own ship. 
LEONARD Jerry, why are we slowing down? 
JERRY (O.S.) She's heavy in the bunt. 
LEONARD That was fast. 
26  EXT. THE GROUCHO - SAME - DAY                               26 
The captain, JULES, hasn't noticed a thing as he lays on his deck tanning himself, a boom-abox blaring next to him. Suddenly THUD. The ship JOLTS for a second. Jules slides and BANGS his head into the boom-box. He yelps. 
DECK HAND The nets are full! 
JULES Then bring 'em in! 
DECK HAND We can't. She won't budge! 
Jules gets up to move aft when THUD, again the ship ROCKS. 
ALL THREE BOATS SLOW TO A CRAWL 
Arthur tries to GUN his engine but it only WHINES. Soon all three boats STOP DEAD. Nothing but quiet for a long beat. 
ARTHUR What is going on? 
Then with another JOLT all three boats begin to move BACKWARDS, DRAGGED BY THEIR OWN NETS! 
LEONARD She's going sternway! 
FIRST MATE What the hell did we catch? 
The three boats begin to PICK UP SPEED, moving BACKWARDS in the water. Water SPLASHES up into the boats, winches begin to CRACK under the building pressure. 
The boats begin to move incredibly FAST backwards. Things on the boat begin to BREAK and CRASH DOWN onto the decks of the ships. 
JULES Cut us free! Cut the nets! 
The same cry is heard on all three boats. Leonard grabs an AXE and starts HACKING AWAY at the tow lines. 
Jules and his deck hands do the same. WIRE SHEERS are brought out for the larger CABLES connected to the nets. Desperately they try and free themselves as their boats are dragged helplessly backwards. 
ARTHUR (screaming at his men) Cut the damned cables! 
A CABLE SNAPS! 
Jules falls backward as the cables and ropes are either cut or snapped from the pressure. Their boat stops. 
ANOTHER CABLE SNAPS! 
Leonard and his crew TUMBLE to the deck as their boat is freed. 
THE HARPO 
Is not so fortunate. The lone boat dragged backwards, faster now without the weight of the other boats. Then suddenly the aft of the boat begins to get PULLED DOWN, dipping into the water. 
With an unstoppable force the Harpo gets PULLED UNDER WATER. Deck hands LEAP off the boat as the top cabin is CRUSHED as the entire ship slowly DISAPPEARS BENEATH THE SEA. 
For a moment all is quiet. No one can believe what just happened. Hearts pounding, catching their breath. 
Then with a WHOOSH of air pressure, the Harpo BURSTS out of the water. With a gigantic SPLASH, the boat FLOPS on its side and capsizes. The waters calm, but the nerves of Jules and Leonard don't. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
27  EXT. CLOUDY SKIES - MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - DAY          27 
A storm is brewing ahead as this large Military Transport plane glides into view then BANKS away. 
PETRI DISH 
A small piece of Nick's SAMPLE is cut away and placed on a glass microscope slide. 
WIDE TO REVEAL: 
28  INT. MILITARY TRANSPORT PLANE - SAME - DAY                  28 
Nick sits on the floor surrounded by his sloppily unpacked equipment as he places the slide under his microscope, examining his specimen. 
Quickly stepping over him a young SOLDIER rushes over to Major Hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the plane's opposing benches. The Solider interrupts their discussion. 
SOLDIER Major, we just got a report of a fishing trawler going down. Exact position, forty seven degrees latitude, 67 longitude. 
MAJOR HICKS What makes you think it's related? 
SOLDIER The trawler was pulled under. 
The team exchanges worried glances. Hicks moves over to a map where the other incidents have been marked. He traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits the 47th parallel. Just off the East Coast. 
MAJOR HICKS Jesus Christ! It's only two hundred miles off the American Eastern seaboard and we don't even know what it is. 
ELSIE Theropoda Allosaurus. Some type of enormous reptile the likes of which we haven't seen since the age of prehistoric dinosaurs. 
CLIVE (sarcastic) So where's been hiding the last sixty million years? 
ELSIE The depth and breath of the ocean floor has barely been explored. His kind could have survived there completely undetected. 
NICK (O.S.) What about the traces of radiation? 
Everyone turns to discover Nick has walked over holding his loosely scribbled notes in his hand. 
The man in the MARKET TRUCK is TOSSED and ENORMOUS TEETH puncture the top and bottom of his truck as it's LIFTED IN THE AIR. The man LEAPS from the open back of the truck. 
He lands, HARD, down in front of one of the fish market stores as hundreds of fish RAIN DOWN from above. With a loud CRASH, the demolished truck SLAMS to the ground nearby. 
33  EXT. POLITICAL RALLY - BUILDING STEPS - RAIN - DAY          33 
With a large RE-ELECT MAYOR FAUSTINO poster behind him, the MAYOR is at the podium. Before him is a sea of umbrellas. 
MAYOR I'd like to thank you all for coming out on this beautiful New York City day. 
Some in the crowd laugh as others applaud. Lost in the sounds of the crowd we HEAR a soft THUMPING in the distance. 
MAYOR When I came into office four years ago, people didn't think we could reduce crime and I did. 
ANGLE - COP IN BACK OF CROWD 
leaning to the cop next to him. 
COP (sarcastic) Yeah, he did. 
MAYOR People didn't think I could restore order... 
This time the THUMPING is HEARD, growing much louder. 
MAYOR ...and I did. The city is a safer place today... 
Before he can continue the crowd begins to murmur with fear as the THUMPING grows LOUDER and CLOSER. Suddenly with a large CRASHING SOUND a building nearby begins to CRUMBLE. 
MAYOR (to his aides) What the hell.... 
People SCRAMBLE to get out of the way as DEBRIS from the falling BUILDING litters the area. The Mayor is pulled inside by his security men. 
Bursting out of the crumbling corner of the building we SEE the enormous LEG of the reptile as it KICKS debris out of its way. 
SIDE ANGLE - WALL STREET - FAST TRAVELING SHOT 
Several cars are SQUASHED quickly as the enormous FEET of the beast STOMPS through the street. Cars FLATTEN and SCATTER, flipping toward us, from the weight of the beast. We try to keep up with it, but it's too fast. 
After it passes, the Mayor sticks his head out of the doorway to see the demolished street scene. 
MAYOR What was that? 
34  INT. WNEW - CAIMAN'S OFFICE - SAME - DAY                    34 
Caiman's on the phone as his SECRETARY enters with some files. Rain and thunder continue outside. 
CAIMAN (into phone) I don't give a crap about some war in a country I can't pronounce. That's not a lead story. Find me a damned story, will ya! 
Just then his Secretary notices a desk lamp, the shade SHAKING and the light FLICKERING. She hears the THUMPING approaching. She turns and SEES... 
GIGANTIC TEETH 
The enormous head of GODZILLA growls as it passes by Caiman's office window. 
SECRETARY Mr. Caiman. I think your story just walked by the window. 
Caiman turns but there's nothing there. He's confused, she's dazed. 
CAIMAN What? 
Just then the TAIL WHIRLS past with a THUNDERS whip. 
35  INT. DINER - SAME - DAY                                     35 
Animal, Lucy and Audrey are at the cashier paying. 
LUCY Did Romeo have a name? 
AUDREY Nick Tatopoulos. 
ANIMAL That why you dumped him? 
AUDREY No! I just couldn't see myself with some boring egg head who spends his summer picking apart cockroaches. I wanted to have some adventure, some fun... 
LUCY And now you live the glamorous life of Caiman's assistant. Life's a bitch, ain't it? 
In the distance we can HEAR the THUMPING approaching. 
ANIMAL How long where you and dis guy goin' steady? 
AUDREY Nearly four years... 
LUCY Four years. Girl, I'm surprised he didn't ask you to marry him. 
AUDREY That's the problem. He did. 
Suddenly the THUMPING gets LOUDER very quickly. Everyone in the diner reacts. 
LUCY Tell me that's not another goddamned parade. 
The next THUMP RATTLES the entire diner. Things begin to fall. Through the window we see people RUNNING in PANIC. 
ANIMAL That's ain't no parade... 
Before anyone can speak the entire building is SHAKING. Through the front window we SEE... 
GODZILLA'S FOOT 
Smashing down directly outside the window. Cars are SMASHED. One car SAILS directly INTO THE WINDOW, shattering it. 
SERGEANT (nervous) After the initial attack he just...disappeared. 
OFFICER (interrupting) Major, Secretary of Defense Burk on the line. 
This takes Major Hicks off guard. The last person he wants to talk to. Nick walks over to the Sergeant. 
NICK I don't understand. How can something that large just disappear? 
SERGEANT We're not sure. We're scanning the area now. 
ELSIE He probably returned to the river. Just like everywhere else we've been, we're always one step behind. 
Nick turns and notices the back of the tent is open revealing a beautiful view of the Manhattan skyline. Several soldiers enter, setting up telescopes. 
NICK I don't think so. 
Over Manhattan we see several dark plumes of smoke from the destruction. Military helicopters scan the city. Staring out at the skyline, Nick is mesmerized. 
NICK I mean, look at it. It's perfect. An island, water on all sides. But like no other island in the world, this is a place where he can easily hide. (beat) He's in there someplace. 
A SOLDIER comes rushing in. 
SOLDIER Channel eight caught it on film! 
He rushes over to a bank of monitors, turns one on. On the screen we SEE the shaky video Animal took of the creature just as it was about to step on him. 
CAIMAN (filtered) ...WNEW's exclusive images of the creature were taken less than a half hour ago. 
Nick and Elsie's jaws nearly hit the floor at the sight of the immense creature. 
CAIMAN Cameraman Victor "Animal" Palotti barely survived this vicious attack to provide us with this footage. 
The sounds of applause lead us to... 
42  INT. WNEW BUILDING - SAME - DAY                             42 
Everyone is applauding as Animal, carrying crates of equipment, passes the t.v. playing the same news story. Embarrassed, Animal smiles awkwardly. 
CO-WORKERS Way to go Animal! That's my man! 
Animal passes Audrey and Lucy who are packing up some files. 
AUDREY Great stuff, Animal. Weren't you scared? 
ANIMAL Sure I was. I thought Lucy was gonna kill me. 
LUCY Damned right, you crazy Wop! 
We SEE the room is in disarray from packing up cartons of boxes and equipment. The workers have taken a break from the packing as they watch the t.v. broadcast. The station manager, MURRAY enters anxiously. 
MURRAY People! We have to be completely relocated to the New Jersey station before our 5:30 broadcast. (reading from list) Okay, Caiman, Devoe and Animal, you're on the helicopter. Everyone else we'll see you in Jersey. 
ANIMAL Gotta go, honey. You guys gonna be all right? 
LUCY Audrey's going to stay with us tonight. 
ANIMAL Great. See ya then. 
Animal hurries out after him. Audrey and Lucy go back to packing. Audrey looks up at the t.v. just as they replay the footage of Nick and Elsie being led into the command tent. 
FIELD REPORTER (filtered) ...military and government health officials set up a command post on the New Jersey coast this afternoon... 
Surprised at first, Audrey suddenly becomes very excited. She SEES Caiman exiting the studio at the end of the hall. She rushes over to him. 
AUDREY Caiman, wait. Take me with you. 
CAIMAN What? 
AUDREY I've got something on this. I know a guy on the inside with the military... 
CAIMAN Not now. You got my bag? 
Audrey holds up his bag as they walk towards the elevator. 
AUDREY You don't understand, I can get us information... 
CAIMAN Listen, this is the time when the big boys have to go to work, okay Honey? 
With that, Caiman walks into the elevator. Pissed, Audrey just stares at him. 
CAIMAN The bag? 
Audrey THROWS the bag at him, knocking him backwards as the elevator doors close. Lucy walks over. 
LUCY Come on, Girl, we've gotta go! 
43  EXT. WNEW OFFICE BUILDING - MINUTES LATER - DAY             43 
Lucy and Audrey carry their bags outside into the chaos that has taken over the city. Hundreds of people trying to leave at once. Gridlock. 
As they move into an overcrowded subway entrance, Audrey looks up just in time to SEE the WNEW NEWS HELICOPTER lifting off from the building behind them. 
CUT TO: 
44  EXT. MANHATTAN - HELICOPTER SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON           44 
We SEE the destroyed parts of downtown Manhattan. Police barricade the streets as firemen work to contain the fires. 
CAIMAN (O.S.) ...in what city officials are calling the worst act of destruction since the World Trade Tower bombing... 
With that he gently pats the Mayor on the back, leaving a small, nearly undetectable DEVICE on the Mayor's collar. 
RAYMOND You can count on our emotional and financial support. 
MAYOR Oh, well, thank you very much. 
Briskly he shakes his hand as he pushes his way through the crowd. Raymond watches him pass, seeing the device stuck to the Mayor's collar. 
ANGLE - WNEW NEWS CHOPPER 
Rushing over from the parked news chopper, Animal and Caiman race for the Mayor who walks through a mob of reporters. 
CAIMAN Hurry, we're going to miss the Mayor. 
But before he can get close, two POLICE OFFICERS stop them. 
POLICE OFFICER Sorry, you gotta have a press ID past this point. 
CAIMAN Don't you watch t.v.? 
POLICE OFFICER Can we see your press pass, sir? 
Flustered, Caiman searches his pockets for his press pass. 
CAIMAN I had one here on my bag. Where the hell did I put it? 
CAIMAN'S PRESS PASS - ECU 
We SEE Caiman's plastic smile on his press ID. Suddenly AUDREY'S picture is placed on top of Caiman's. 
WIDEN TO REVEAL: 
57  INT. SUBWAY STATION - SAME - LATER AFTERNOON                57 
Smashed together like sardines, Audrey plays with Caiman's press pass, trying to put her photo over his. 
LUCY What the hell are you doing? 
AUDREY Remember my friend we saw on t.v.? 
LUCY Your old sweetheart? 
AUDREY Yeah, well he just turned up in New Jersey at the military command post. Somehow all this is related to what happened down in Panama. There's a story here. I know it. You got any tape or glue? 
LUCY I left my forgery kit back at the office. 
Audrey looks over at a young ten year old boy holding his backpack, a RULER sticking out of the back. 
AUDREY Hey, do you have any glue in your bag? 
KID What's it to you? 
AUDREY Can I use some? 
KID What do I get? 
AUDREY The warm feeling of helping your fellow man. 
KID Five bucks. 
AUDREY You're kidding, right? 
The Kid simply puts his hand out. 
58  EXT. NEW JERSEY TRAIN STATION - LATER                       58 
People FLOOD off the train out into the station. 
P.A. ANNOUNCER Please exit the station. For those of you without accommodations, the city has opened up shelters on Monroe and 60th and at Bergenline and 72nd. Please exit the... 
Audrey and Lucy walk through the crowd. Audrey turns and gives Lucy a kiss. 
AUDREY Wish me luck! 
LUCY Audrey, I don't think this is a very good idea. Caiman finds out and he'll have your job. 
AUDREY I'm tired of waiting for someone else to give me an opportunity, Luce. If there's a story here I'm going to find it. 
Lucy nods in acceptance as Audrey disappears into the dense crowd. Lucy worries for her friend. 
CUT TO: 
"YUM YUM DOUGHNUTS" BAG - PRE-SUNSET 
Carried along with a Styrofoam cup of coffee. We WIDEN TO REVEAL a MAN carrying the junk food to a GREY VAN parked not too far from the Command Center Tent across the way. 
The man knocks on the back of the van. The van opens to reveal... 
59  INT. RAYMOND'S VAN - PRE-SUNSET                             59 
Filled with high tech monitoring equipment, Raymond and his men are listening in to a conversation. The man with junk food hands it to Raymond. 
RAYMOND Merci. 
He opens the bag and takes out a croissant. He bites into it and grimaces. To wash away the taste, he drinks from the coffee. It's worse than the croissant. 
RAYMOND You call this coffee? 
MAN (French accent) I call this America. 
Flopping on the ground is a large FISH. As the beam moves farther along we see two, no, three fish ahead. 
CUT TO: 
62  EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - POST-SUNSET (MAGIC HOUR)        62 
A battalion of armored TANKS roll down this deserted city street. A large number of GROUND TROOPS march behind. 
COBRA HELICOPTERS - SAME - MAGIC HOUR 
Banking in formation, the helicopters swerve, heading towards mid-town Manhattan. 
SAND BAG FORTIFICATION 
Soldiers pile up sand bags, creating a make shift fortification. SHARP SHOOTERS and a BAZOOKA BRIGADE settle into place. 
63  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   63 
Major Hicks moves over to a jeep and grabs the radio. 
64  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       64 
Major Hicks sits by a bank of communications technicians. 
MAJOR HICKS Where are they now? 
RADIO TECHNICIAN Delta niner, what is convoy position? 
65  EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    65 
Led by armored military vehicles we SEE a convoy of TWENTY YELLOW DUMP TRUCKS passing over the bridge. 
DRIVER (O.S.) Command, we're just entering the city. 
66  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME              66 
Sergeant O'Neal listens to the response on the radio. 
RADIO TECHNICIAN Convoy ETA, five minutes. 
The Sergeant signals several military technicians, who are mounting several video cameras to hurry. 
67  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                       67 
A buzz of activity. Military Officials and personnel. The Mayor enters and joins his aides in the back of the room. 
MAYOR (whispering to Aide) They find anything yet? 
The Aide shakes his head. Monitors come to life with a live video feed-from several cameras we saw mounted. 
A CABLE REPAIRMAN - MAGIC HOUR 
In blue overalls, the REPAIRMAN walks up to a large satellite dish. We WIDEN to REVEAL the dish is parked next to the Command Tent. He kneels down next to some cables leading away from the dish toward the Command Tent. 
68  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAGIC HOUR                              68 
Suddenly all the screens FUZZ OUT. Just as quickly the monitors return to normal. No one seems to notice. 
69  EXT. SATELLITE DISH - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                     69 
The Repairman finishes affixing a small DEVICE to the cable. He taps his earpiece and speaks into his own lapel. 
REPAIRMAN (French accent) It is good. 
70  INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                         70 
We SEE Raymond and his men have turned this dingy Motel room into a command central of their own. Raymond is putting sugar into his coffee when a bank of monitors turn on. They are seeing THE SAME VIDEO FEED as the Mayor. Pleased, he takes a sip. It's awful. 
RAYMOND You said this was French Roast! 
His aid turns, holding a package labeled FRENCH ROAST. 
RAYMOND (defeated) More cream. 
His associate hands him some milk. He adds it to the coffee. No use, it still sucks. On the monitors we SEE the DUMP TRUCKS entering Flat Iron Square. 
71  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                   71 
The DUMP TRUCKS arrive and the soldiers guide the trucks, forming a circle, their tails facing each other. As the last one passes it REVEALS Nick and Sergeant O'Neal. 
SERGEANT O'NEAL I sure hope your plan works. 
NICK I'm kind of hoping the same thing. 
The twenty of them, in concert, begin to dump their cargo. 
LOW ANGLE - CENTER OF THE DUMP TRUCK CIRCLE 
Tons and tons of FISH are DUMPED directly on top of us. 
72  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL - SAME - MAGIC HOUR                    72 
On the monitors they watch in astonishment as the fish get dumped into a large pile in the center of Flat Iron Square. 
AIDE Tres bizarre. 
RAYMOND No. (leaning forward) Very clever. 
73  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - FISH PILE - SAME - NIGHT            73 
YOUNG OFFICER Where're you going? Nick! 
Nick stops briefly as the Young Officer TOSSES a gas mask to Nick who quickly puts it on and dashes for a closer spot. Suddenly SAILING OVER HIS HEAD we SEE... 
GAS CANISTERS 
Firing from the air cannons, the GAS CANISTERS streak across the sky landing behind Godzilla. The Yellow gas forms a wall of smoke that drifts upwards. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - OPPOSITE CORNER 
Across the way eight MORE CANISTERS are FIRED at the beast. Quickly Godzilla is surrounded by the gas fumes. 
ANGLE - NICK 
Frustrated at his inability to see through the smoke, he DASHES forward over to a large BRONZE STATUE. 
GODZILLA 
The smoke annoying and distracting him, Godzilla spins, his tail waving the smoke away. But the smoke returns. Godzilla YELLS OUT. Frustrated he rears back and BLASTS! 
For the first time we SEE the infamous POWER BREATH of Godzilla. With amazing FORCE the smoke, canisters, cars and anything that isn't nailed down SAILS BACKWARDS from the intense pressure. 
Nick is HIT by the WAVE of air pressure and is sent FLYING BACKWARDS, impossibly high in the air. 
An enormous fabric BANNER advertising this season at the MET, catches Nick who SLIDES down the banner, hitting the ground, HARD. Just as he looks up he SEES... 
A LARGE TRUCK 
Tumbling toward him from the power breath. Nick SCRAMBLES to his feet just in time as the rolling Truck SMASHES into the building behind where he just sat. 
ANGLE - TROOPS - FORTIFICATION 
The troops have to SCATTER as the tumbling trucks and cars are FLUNG AT THEM, disabling their attack forces. Trucks and rocket launches are CRUSHED by the tumbling debris. 
Godzilla CONTINUES to BLOW at everything around him. Cars and trucks ROLLING. Soldiers DIVING for cover. It's chaos. 
The glass in all the surrounding buildings SHATTER, shards of glass raining down. Windows, street lamps, all blown out by the tremendous gale force winds. 
81  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              81 
On the monitors we SEE the melee. 
MAJOR HICKS Fire at will! 
82  EXT. ROOFTOP - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME - NIGHT               82 
SERGEANT O'NEAL Fire at will. Fire at will. 
83  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                        83 
From all angles, soldiers rush back to their equipment and attempt to FIRE. Very few are able to get off rounds. 
84  EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME - NIGHT                                 84 
O'Neal tries to steady himself as the soldiers FIRE down at the creature below. One HOISTS a MISSILE launcher. 
ANGLE - GODZILLA - NIGHT 
As the FIREPOWER begins around Godzilla, he takes a hit in the shoulder and SCREAMS OUT. Suddenly he LEAPS away just as several MISSLES HIT the Flat Iron Building behind where Godzilla was standing only moments earlier. 
Dashing down a side street, Godzilla LEAPS over the waiting tanks who cannot adjust their cannons in time. WE'VE NEVER SEEM HIM MOVE THIS QUICKLY. Several tanks are SQUASHED as the beast bull dozes right through the regiment. 
85  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                            85 
We SEE the Flat Iron Building crumbling on one of the monitors near Major Hicks. In the rear of the room the Mayor looks sick. 
86  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                        86 
Soldiers come out from behind the crashed vehicles and debris. Only the smoldering devastation is left behind. 
87  INT. COMMAND TENT - MAJOR HICKS - SAME - NIGHT              87 
The monitors only show static or devastation. 
MAJOR HICKS (into radio) O'Neal, what the hell is going on there!? 
88  EXT. ROOFTOP - SAME                                         88 
Quickly his men are packing up. 
SERGEANT O'NEAL (into radio) He's gone, Sir. Echo division's in pursuit. 
89  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS (6TH AVE.) - SAME - NIGHT       89 
Four ARMORED MILITARY VEHICLES come SKIDDING around the corner in hot pursuit. Each with a team manning enormous mounted weaponry. 
REVERSE ANGLE - 6TH AVE. - GODZILLA 
Galloping like a Gisele uptown, Godzilla is SPEEDING up the boulevard. The armored vehicles OPEN FIRE. Some shots CLIP into Godzilla's back. Ahead he is running directly into... 
MOBILE MISSILE LAUNCHERS 
Blocking off the street in front of him. They FIRE. Pinned down, the creature SCREAMS and DUCKS away down another side street. The missiles can't turn fast enough and SLAM into a building, DEMOLISHING it. 
90  EXT. ELECTRONICS STORE - SAME - NIGHT                       90 
The window is SMASHED in. A small group of LOOTERS are loading up their mini-van. Finishing up the group is about to leave. 
LOOTER #1 Jimmy, let's go. 
99  EXT. AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS - SAME - NIGHT                  99 
As the remaining Cobra helicopter SWERVES around, Godzilla is gone. 
HELICOPTER PILOT #4 I don't know sir. He just vanished. 
As the helicopter PASSES a dark building we SEE a SHAPE MOVE! We realize that like a chameleon, Godzilla had TAKEN THE COLOR of the building and hid. With the helicopter past him, he CHASES FROM THE REAR. 
HELICOPTER PILOT #4 (realizing) Oh Jesus! 
The chopper GUNS IT, full throttle. Godzilla GIVES CHASE. Even at its top speed it can't out run the big creature. 
The chopper tries to LIFT AWAY but before he can get the height, Godzilla SNAPS his gigantic jaws and SWALLOWS THE HELICOPTER WHOLE. 
STREET - WIDE ANGLE 
The fires burn and the rubble crumbles. Godzilla gives one final SCREAM and DIVES into a building, disappearing. 
100  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME - NIGHT                           100 
The Major's aide try to hold him back as the Mayor is charging at Major Hicks. 
MAYOR What the hell is the matter with you people?! You caused more damage than that thing did! 
101  EXT. 5TH AVENUE - SAME - NIGHT                             101 
Empty and devastated. Fires continue to burn. 
102  EXT. FLAT IRON SQUARE - SAME - NIGHT                       102 
Nick, Sergeant O'Neal and several of his men walk through the devastated area. Nick kneels down and SEES... 
NICK'S P.O.V. - PUDDLE OF BLOOD 
There is a large reddish brown puddle of blood. Nick takes out a small glass container and scoops some up. 
SERGEANT O'NEAL I can't believe it. He did all this and we did nothing to him. 
Nick walks over to him, consoling. 
NICK That's not true. We fed him. 
REVERSE ANGLE 
Only a few scattered fish remain where the mountain of fish once was. Our team stands there amidst the rubble. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: 
103  INT. NETWORK NEWS DESK - VIDEO FOOTAGE                     103 
A network news ANCHOR speaks directly at us as a video of the Chrysler building getting destroyed plays behind him. 
ANCHOR While it may have looked like Beirut, it was in fact, Manhattan where man and nature have collided with brute force. 
The video switches to the White House where we SEE the President signing a bill. 
ANCHOR The President today declared a state of emergency and has issued disaster relief funds to New York City. 
WIDEN TO REVEAL: 
104  INT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - VIDEO FEEDS - SAME - NIGHT          104 
We SEE that we've been watching the video on one of MANY video monitors showing all the news broadcasts. As an assistant moves away from the monitors we FOLLOW him out of the truck. 
105  EXT. WNEW NEWS TRUCK - CONTINUOUS - SAME - NIGHT           105 
We continue to FOLLOW the assistant outside, revealing the enormous MOB of reporters that have gathered just outside the military command tents. As we FOLLOW the assistant he passes several reporters doing "stand-up" reports. 
REPORTER #1 ...rumors continue to mount as to the origin of this, perhaps, lost dinosaur... 
REPORTER #2 ...having shut down the United Nations in the evacuation, foreign diplomats are demanding an international coalition be assembled to track the creature... 
The assistant finally arrives at Caiman who is doing a live remote. Animal works the camera. 
CAIMAN ...Maintaining a total media blackout, officials remain silent this evening as to their progress in containing this creature... 
Behind him, in the crowd we SEE Audrey pushing her way through the reporters, her fake ID pinned on her shirt. She turns and sees Caiman. Quickly she ducks down and moves deeper into the crowds. 
Suddenly there is movement as the crowd turns their collective attention over to a group of cars pulling up nearby. Audrey pushes her way to see what's happening. 
The cars are BLOCKED from returning to the command tents as the reporters MOB the first car in line. 
106  INT. SEDAN - NICK - NIGHT                                  106 
Nick observes the chaos. Through the crowd he SEES a Pharmacy, a neon sign reading: Never Closes. He looks back down at the blood sample he holds in his lap and gets an idea. 
NICK (to the driver) It's okay, I'll get out here. 
He opens the car door and pushes his way through the crowds who are less interested in him as they are the military officials. 
NICK'S P.O.V. - MEDIA CIRCUS - CROWDS - NIGHT 
Pushing his way through, Nick SEES what a circus this has become; t.v. news camera crews, journalists, concerned citizens, worried mothers, and of course, merchandising... 
STREET STANDS 
Nick passes several vendors selling dinosaur toys, copies of Animal's now famous news video clip and, of course, tee shirts with still images from that same clip. 
AUDREY Are you sure? 
Nick gets up and starts to gather his materials. 
NICK (thrilled) Well, obviously these tests weren't designed for this but fundamentally they're looking for the same hormonal patterns that would indicate pregnancy. 
AUDREY I don't get it. If it's the first of its kind, how can it be pregnant? 
Excitedly Nick begins to pace. 
NICK The ultimate expression of evolution, it reproduces asexually. Think about it, all kinds of creatures have been known to travel great distances for reproduction. That's why he came to New York. Like every species of insufficient progenitors, he's nesting! 
AUDREY Nesting? 
NICK Yes. Do you realize that a creature like this could lay as many as a dozen eggs at a time! 
Nick moves to the front exit of the tent. 
NICK Forgive me but I've got to get this into the lab, to confirm all this. I'll be right back. 
Nick rushes from the tent. Alone, Audrey can't help but poke around a bit. She opens one of his CASES. Taped to the roof of the case she SEES... 
INSERT PHOTOS - NICK AND AUDREY 
Happy times long ago. They're both young and in love. Audrey is surprised Nick still keeps them. She's touched. 
Feeling guilty she quickly closes the case and sits back down. As she does she notices a video tape labeled FIRST SIGHTING. Unable to resist, she puts it in and turns on the t.v. The shot of the Japanese Cook appears. 
COOK (filtered through t.v.) ...Gojira...Gojira... 
She hits the fast forward tape and SEES, the enormous footprints in Panama. She fast forwards again and sees the beached cargo ship in Jamaica. 
Audrey is torn. She makes a decision, pops the tape back out, puts in her purse and takes off out the back of the tent. Moments later, Nick returns from the front. 
NICK Audrey? Audrey? 
A flash of lighting and thunder accents Nick's confusion. 
CUT TO: 
110  INT. EDITING BAY - LATER - DAWN                            110 
On two monitors we SEE Audrey doing a "stand up." 
AUDREY (filtered) ...which is why in this case "all the kings horses and all the kings men" may not be able to put the big apple together again. Audrey Timmons, WNEW. 
We pull back to reveal Audrey, Animal and an editor, ED, watching the piece. 
ED That's it. You owe me a breakfast. 
AUDREY (turning to Animal) So, what do you think? 
ANIMAL It's good. It's a real good piece. But how'd you get a hold of this material? 
Audrey covers her own mixed emotions. 
AUDREY Like you said, "Good guys finish last." 
She snatches the tape and she takes off running. Concerned and worried, Animal watches her leave. 
CUT TO: 
111  EXT. WNEW TRUCK - COMMAND TENT AREA - RAIN - DAWN          111 
Rushing out of the WNEW truck and into the rain, Audrey spots her Station Manager, Murray. In the b.g. we SEE Caiman getting make up, about to do a live spot with another cameraman. 
AUDREY Murray, I need you to look at this tape. 
MURRAY Not now, Audrey, we've about to go live with the morning report. 
AUDREY You're going to want to include this. I've got exclusive footage of other places this thing has attacked. 
MURRAY (suddenly interested) You do? Who's story is this? 
AUDREY Mine! 
ANGLE - CAIMAN 
About to go on, Caiman waves off his make up artist as he watches Audrey hand Murray the tape. His field producer counts down to going live. 
P.O.V. THROUGH BINOCULARS - NICK - RAIN - MORNING 
Through the lenses we SEE exiting his tent and moving on towards the large center command tent. We REVERSE to reveal... 
112  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - RAIN - MORNING          112 
One of Raymond's men observes with binoculars from the window. Tucking his napkin into his lapel, Raymond eats breakfast with his men. Another man, JEAN-CLAUDE, listens at the monitoring equipment. He turns to Raymond. 
JEAN-CLAUDE Taisez-Vous. 
He turns on the room speaker. 
MALE VOICE (filtered) ...Major Hicks, what makes you believe another attempt to gun that creature down will work? 
113  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - RAIN - SAME - MORNING       113 
Nick is moving to take his seat next to Elise at this very crowded conference. The big wigs are here and the room is packed. Major Hicks walks to a large map of Manhattan. 
MAJOR HICKS General Anderson, the problem was the terrain. If we lure him out into a more open area such as this portion of Central Park... (points to the map) We should be able to take him down. 
MAJOR HICKS You gave them the tape? 
NICK No, it's still in my tent. It's...oh my God, she took it. 
Pissed, GENERAL ANDERSON walks up to Nick. 
GENERAL ANDERSON Pack your stuff. You're officially off this project as of now. 
120  INT. DINER - SAME - MORNING                                120 
Caiman is still on television, wrapping up. 
AUDREY He stole my report! That's my report! 
ANIMAL We know, Audrey. 
CAIMAN (filtered) ...and in this reporter's opinion, "all the kings horses and all the kings men"... 
Audrey wads up her napkin and heaves it at the t.v. 
AUDREY Caiman you suck! 
121  INT. RAYMOND'S MOTEL ROOM - SAME - MORNING                 121 
The television is snapped OFF and Raymond walks over to the window looking out, thinking. Finally... 
RAYMOND We're leaving. 
CUT TO: 
A LARGE TRUNK 
Slams shut. More suitcases and trunks. Widen to reveal... 
122  INT. NICK'S TENT - LATER - DAY                             122 
Nick is finishing packing as some soldiers carry his things away. Elsie enters. 
ELSIE I'm sorry about all this. 
NICK Me too. 
Nick hoists his bag and moves to leave. 
NICK Make sure they find that nest before it's too late. 
ELSIE I'll try. 
Reluctantly Nick nods acceptance and exits out into the rain. We SEE the torn photographs of Nick and Audrey laying on the floor. 
ELSIE Bye worm guy. 
CUT TO: 
123  INT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER - RAIN - DAY              123 
Audrey in a street phone booth. 
AUDREY What do you mean Murray's not there? A second ago you told me he was on the other line... 
Something catches Audrey's eye. 
AUDREY'S P.O.V. - THROUGH GLASS - NICK 
Lugging his bags out into the rain, Nick moves over to a waiting cab. 
124  EXT. COMMAND TENT AREA - NICK & CAB - RAIN - DAY           124 
Lifting a heavy case, Nick places it into the cab's trunk. 
CABBY Where to? 
NICK Newark airport. 
Audrey moves up behind Nick. 
AUDREY You're leaving? Why? 
Nick ignores her and continues to load the cab. 
AUDREY Is this cause of me? Because of the story? 
NICK Well what the hell did you think was going to happen? 
AUDREY You never said it was off the record. 
NICK I shouldn't have to, Audrey. You're supposed to be my friend. I trusted you. 
AUDREY I didn't mean for it to turn out like this. (confessing) Look, I lied to you. I'm not a reporter. When we broke up and I came out to New York I was so sure I'd make it. But I haven't. That's why I needed this story so bad. I just couldn't tell you I'm a failure. 
NICK So you thought that made it okay to steal my tapes? 
The last bag stowed, Nick moves to get into the cab. He stops and turns back to her. 
NICK Good luck in your new career. I think you really have what it takes. 
He gets in and slams the door. The cab takes off leaving a very alone Audrey standing in the rain. 
AUDREY (sad; to herself) I'm sorry. 
Raymond considers this. Finally... 
RAYMOND I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that? 
NICK Sure. 
RAYMOND It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about. 
NICK Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific. 
RAYMOND Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up. 
129  EXT. WAREHOUSE - ANIMAL - SAME - RAIN - AFTERNOON          129 
Moving down alongside the building, Animal walks down the side alley. He climbs up onto a garbage hamper and peers into a cracked opened window. 
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - WAREHOUSE 
Animal sees Nick and Raymond with all the hardware. Several of the men are repainting the vehicles to resemble those of the US Army. 
130  INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME                                      130 
Nick walks past the myriad of warfare tools. Jean-Claude turns from the radios. 
JEAN-CLAUDE They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten. 
RAYMOND That is when we will go in. 
Raymond leads Nick over to a large map. 
RAYMOND We know how to get into the city. We just do not know where to start looking. 
Nick moves closer to the map, putting his finger on the Flat Iron square subway station. 
NICK Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it. 
RAYMOND So you're in? 
NICK Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion. 
CUT TO: 
131  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON    131 
Animal quickly climbs the stairs. People are everywhere. He has to step over them to get to his apartment. AS he opens the door to his apartment he SEES... 
132  INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON               132 
Filled with people, Lucy is serving coffee. She smiles at Animal as he enters. 
ANIMAL Who the hell are all these people? 
LUCY What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street. 
ANIMAL Where's Audrey? 
LUCY In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you. 
ANIMAL What? 
LUCY All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with. 
ANIMAL Me!? You where the one... 
LUCY Go in there. Talk to her. 
Lucy pushes Animal towards the back bedroom. 
133  INT. BEDROOM - SAME - LATE AFTERNOON                       133 
Audrey has been crying. Crumpled Kleenex wads piled up all around her. A television plays a news broadcast, boasting the headline: THEY CALL HIM GODZILLA! On the t.v. we SEE a news conference with General Anderson addressing some reporters. 
REPORTERS (simultaneously) Can you comment on the nest? How many more of these things will there be? 
GENERAL ANDERSON (filtered) That's why I'm holding this conference. To try and avoid a needless panic. 
Animal enters and watches from the back of the room. 
GENERAL ANDERSON Contrary to some frivolous reports, we have no information to lead us to believe that there are any eggs of the creature in the city. 
AUDREY Stupid idiots! 
ANIMAL You okay? 
AUDREY It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this. 
ANIMAL You made a mistake. 
Suddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of the room. Animal looks at the stranger as he leaves. 
AUDREY Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me. 
ANIMAL Didn't you tell me he left for the airport? 
AUDREY Yeah. Why are you asking? 
ANIMAL I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight. 
Audrey tries to make sense of this. Suddenly she realizes. 
Doors slam and immediately boots march past. We WIDEN to reveal Raymond's team quickly gathering their gear and heading down the subway entrance. 
Raymond grabs a heavy bag and tosses it to Nick who nearly topples from the weight. 
RAYMOND Be careful with that. 
Nick looks into the bag and sees a bag marked EXPLOSIVES. Shocked he looks back at Raymond, but he's gone. Nick regains his breath and follows. 
THE FISH 
Older and nastier, but the same fish we saw in the tunnel before. We FOLLOW the beam to its owner and find Nick. We WIDEN to reveal that we're.... 
140  INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT                 140 
The crisscrossing beams from the assault team's flashlights nearly blind us as Nick leads the team cautiously into the depth of this tunnel. Periodic fish are found along the way. Suddenly the faint HUMMING sound in the tunnel STOPS. 
Everyone freezes as the wind shifts direction. A familiar SMELL passes over them as they sniff the air. 
NICK They've turned off the ventilation system. They're calling him to dinner. 
RAYMOND Let's hope we are not the hors d'oeuvres. 
Nervously they continue onward. 
141  EXT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             141 
Animal and Audrey arrive, spotting the assault team's vehicles. They head carefully down the stairs. 
142  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - SAME - NIGHT             142 
Audrey and Animal, camera in hand shooting everything, climb down into the station. Animal rushes to the end of the platform and searches down into the tunnels. 
VIDEO P.O.V. - DARK TUNNEL - DISTANT LIGHTS 
Through the camera we SEE the lights in the distance of the tunnel. 
ANIMAL (whispering) They're down there. Let's go. 
Animal jumps off the platform, down onto what's left of the tracks. Audrey squeamishly follows. 
143  INT. TUNNELS - NICK & TEAM - SAME - NIGHT                  143 
Nick kneels down to inspect some debris. An old SCREECHING SOUND is heard in the distance. Suddenly the ground begins to quake. Dust falling. The SCREECHING gets louder and louder. 
Raymond moves up to Nick and points ahead. Nick nods in nervous agreement. Just as they move towards the sounds the ENTIRE WALL OF THE TUNNEL COLLAPSES next to them. 
Bursting through the tunnel wall GODZILLA appears. His enormous claws burrowing, he makes his way through and into the tunnel. Quickly he moves past the team. 
The team DIVES into a cross tunnel just as the colossal beast BLASTS past them, barely missing them. 
144  INT. 23RD STREET SUBWAY STATION - TUNNEL ENTRANCE          144 
Audrey and Animal have just gotten into the tunnel entrance. The entire place is shaking. Audrey is in a panic. 
AUDREY Animal, let's get out of here. 
But Animal hoists his camera and starts filming as SOMETHING is moving TOWARDS them. Audrey is tugging at him as the shaking gets more violent. With all her strength, she finally gets Animal to start moving backwards. 
Just as they're out of the tunnel, the CREATURE BLASTS outward. Audrey and Animal DIVE into the maintenance ducks along side the tracks to avoid collision. 
ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL 
Animal is shielding Audrey with his body. She looks up just in time to SEE Godzilla CRAWLING UP and out through the ceiling. An amazing site. 
AUDREY Shoot! Shoot it! 
Animal grabs his camera and gets the last moment of it disappearing from view. Once gone, they both break into enormous sighs of relief and nervous laughter. 
145  INT. TUNNEL - SAME                                         145 
Recovering, Raymond and the team walk back into the main tunnel. They near the hole Godzilla just created, examining it. Nick climbs into the hole. 
NICK I guess we go this way. 
Raymond and his men follow. 
146  INT. COMMAND TENT - WAR ROOM - SAME - NIGHT                146 
Major Hicks is at the radio as the Generals sit behind him. 
MAJOR HICKS (into radio) Sergeant, status? 
147  INT. CENTRAL PARK - SAME - NIGHT                           147 
The park is bathed in light. Armed troops surround the area. Tanks and missile launchers are in place. Sergeant O'Neal kneels down by a sandbag fortification. 
SERGEANT O'NEAL (into radio) Any sign of it? 
148  EXT. ROOFTOP - SPOTTERS - SAME - NIGHT                     148 
From the rooftop of one of the central park south high rises, a team of SPOTTERS scan the area. 
SPOTTER P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - GODZILLA 
Moving steadily towards central park, Godzilla makes his way up seventh avenue. 
SPOTTER Got him. Section 5, heading north to target. 
149  EXT. CENTRAL PARK - SERGEANT O'NEAL - SAME                 149 
Raymond turns and sees Nick, across the room studying a group of eggs. Raymond goes towards him. 
ANGLE - AUDITORIUM FLOOR - HOLE - SAME 
Crawling out from the hole in the center of the floor, Animal and Audrey appear. They're stunned at what they see. Quickly Animal hoists his camera and begins to film as an amazed Audrey walks through. 
ANGLE - NICK AND EGGS - MID-LEVEL DECK 
Kneeling down along side the eggs, Nick examines them. Raymond approaches. 
RAYMOND Nick, we have a problem. 
Nick silences him with a gesture as he moves in to listen to the egg. He leans his ear against the shell. Suddenly we HEAR a loud CRACK. Nick jumps backwards. 
The shell RUPTURES and an large FISSURE opens up across the egg. As we hear other CRACKS O.S., Nick turns and SEES more eggs beginning to open all around them. 
ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL 
Hidden in this forest of tall eggs, Animal leans in close to one getting video footage of it cracking. Audrey nervously watches. What she doesn't see, however, is a BABYZILLA, fish hanging from its jaw, as it approaches from behind. 
ANGLE - NICK AND RAYMOND 
Stunned, they can only stare as the BABYZILLA BREAKS FREE of his shell and gives a mini version of the famous WAIL. 
RAYMOND I think we should leave now. 
NICK Good idea. 
The BABYZILLA kneels down and immediately starts GOBBLING UP the dead fish laying nearby. Cautiously Nick and Raymond slowly back away until they are a far enough distance, they they break into a run and head for the exit. 
ANGLE - AUDREY AND ANIMAL - FLOOR LEVEL 
The Babyzilla continues to chomp on its fish as it nears Audrey. Animal continues to shoot the cracking egg. 
ANIMAL (whispered) One more second. This is fantastic. 
Just then Animal turns to SEE the Babyzilla right behind Audrey. 
AUDREY Don't you think we have enough? 
ANIMAL Yes. Definitely. Definitely enough. 
Audrey turns to see what Animal is staring at. Her eyes go WIDE as she backs up into Animal. Another BABYZILLA appear on the other side of them. 
ANIMAL Just be calm. Don't startle them. 
Animal leads Audrey backwards as they make their way towards the large "team" entrance at the end of the floor. The two Babyzillas swallow their fish and begin to SNIFF the air. 
Audrey moves up the isle. An egg CRACKS and an ARM breaks out through a shell, GRABBING HER LEG. Audrey FREAKS and frantically she KICKS herself free. They both suddenly take off running. 
189  INT. MID-LEVEL HALLWAYS - SAME                             189 
Nick and Raymond race to the stairwell. Raymond pulls out his radio. 
RAYMOND (into radio) Everyone, outside! Now! 
ANGLE - JEAN-CLAUDE - MID-LEVEL DECKS - ACROSS THE ROOM 
Laying down the plastic explosives. Hearing the radio, he drops what they're doing just as several eggs near them begin to CRACK. Quickly he and his partner take off running. 
190  INT. FAR BACK WALL - LOWER LEVEL - SAME                    190 
Two other men are still laying cables for the explosives. One of them is kneeling in a pile of FISH near the eggs. 
R-MAN #2 Come on, let's go. 
R-MAN #3 One moment. I've almost got this. 
Just then a BABYZILLA pops up behind the eggs, a fish in his mouth. He SWALLOWS the fish and begins SNIFFING THE AIR. He turns and stares directly at the slowly retreating R-MAN #3. 
He smells his own hands and realizes he smells like fish, quickly he turns and RUNS. 
But Babyzilla is faster. He runs up from behind and LEAPS onto R-MAN #3's back. R-MAN #2 begins to FIRE at Babyzilla just as another one TACKLES HIM from the side. 
In moments, they are both devoured. 
191  INT. TEAM ENTRANCE - FLOOR-LEVEL - SAME                    191 
Audrey and Animal reach the entrance and race inside. The main exit doors are locked from the outside. They turn back just as... 
THREE BABYZILLAS 
appear in the team entrance doorway SNIFFING THE AIR. Audrey SEES something, grabs Animal's wrist and pulls him to one of the Locker room doors. It's open. 
192  INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              192 
Through the door we SEE the Babyzilla approaching as Audrey and Animal leap inside, slamming the door behind them. There is a sudden THUD against the door. 
Animal rushes over to a large LOCKER CABINET and, with all his strength, PUSHES it over, blocking the door. 
AUDREY Great. Now what do we do? 
193  INT. HALLWAYS - MID-LEVEL - SAME                           193 
Nick and Raymond run up to another open doorway and look inside. 
NICK'S P.O.V. - AUDITORIUM 
Dozens and dozens of eggs HATCHING. BABYZILLAS everywhere begin to awaken and immediately begin to devour all the fish. A Babyzilla appears only feet away and turns and stares directly at us. 
AUDREY We're live from inside Madison Square Garden where Dr. Niko Tatopoulos has discovered the beasts lair. Doctor, tell us what is happening here. 
Animal swerves the camera over to Nick. Raymond stays back behind the camera, watching. 
NICK We've discovered over two hundred eggs which began hatching only moments ago. 
216  INT. LUXURY BOXES HALLWAY - SAME                           216 
The creatures come bursting out of the stairwell and flood into the hall. Sniffing around they pick up the scent and take off. 
217  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   217 
A Soldier tugs on Major Hicks shoulder, try to get his attention. 
MAJOR HICKS What is it? 
SOLDIER You better see this. 
The Major turns around just in time to SEE Nick on the t.v. 
NICK If the military are listening, they must immediately destroy this building before they can escape. 
AUDREY (O.S.) Oh my God! They're coming! 
The camera SWERVES to SEE through the luxury booths across from them, the dozens of Babyzillas approaching. 
218  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                     218 
The bedroom is packed with Lucy's "guests" as they watch the t.v., SEEING the Babyzillas. 
LUCY Oh my God! 
On the screen the image turns to Nick. 
NICK (filtered) If those creatures escape and multiply, in a very short time a new species will emerge. One that could replace us as the dominant species of this planet. 
219  INT. COMMAND TENT - SAME                                   219 
Major Hicks is on the phone. 
MAJOR HICKS (into phone) That's correct, I want you to blow up Madison Square Garden. No I'm not drunk. (to O'Neal) Contact the news station. Tell them we're on the way. 
220  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME - NIGHT                        220 
Raymond spots a large spool of co-axle cable. Quickly he ties it to the support beam. 
AUDREY Reporting live from Madison Square Garden, this is Audrey Timmonds, WNEW. 
221  INT. AUDREY'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - SAME                   221 
Everyone is breathless watching the news. Lucy beams. 
LUCY That's my girl. 
222  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                222 
Animal lowers the camera and everyone is silent. 
NICK Thanks, Audrey. 
The computer beeps, Animal reads the message. 
ANIMAL The good news is they got the message. The bad news is we've got five and a half minutes to get out of the building. 
Suddenly the room ROCKS as the Babyzillas begin crashing against the blocked door. Raymond jumps to his feet. 
RAYMOND Okay, party's over. Time to leave. 
With that he SPRAYS bullets into the front glass window SHATTERING IT. Glass rains down below. Raymond tosses the spool of cable out the broken window. 
RAYMOND Anyone care to join me? 
Animal dislodges one of the video cameras, hoists it on his shoulder and moves over to join Raymond. 
223  EXT. AIR BASE - F-18 SQUADRON - SAME - NIGHT               223 
Several F-18's prepare to take flight. We focus on one, an enormous bomb attached under its wing. The F-18 taxis away from us. 
224  INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - AUDITORIUM - SAME             224 
Repelling down from the broken window of the broadcast booth, Animal and Raymond land on the upper-level balcony. Raymond signals to the others to follow. 
225  INT. BROADCAST BOOTH - SAME                                225 
Audrey and Nick are nervous as they stare at the long drop down. The door is begging to give way from the repeated THUMPING. Suddenly Audrey leans over and kisses Nick. 
AUDREY In case I can't later. 
With that she JUMPS out, repelling downward. Nick is stunned by the unexpected kiss. Suddenly the door GIVES and the Babyzilla FLOOD into the room. Nick jumps. 
226  INT. AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS                               226 
Audrey hits the ground followed by Nick. Raymond leads as they make their way out. 
On the other end of the room some Babyzilla appear in a doorway and watch our friends scurry away. The Babyzillas take off in hot pursuit. 
227  INT. DARK SKIES - F-18 SQUADRON - NIGHT                    227 
The F-18's fly in formation. Their leader carrying the same bomb we saw loaded earlier. 
AUDREY Really? I'd like to find out. 
She hugs him tightly. Nick smiles. Animal turns to Raymond who has cut above his eye. 
ANIMAL Hey Man, you all right? 
RAYMOND I could use a coffee. 
We begins to pull away from this tableau, slowly lifting upwards when suddenly... 
THAT FAMOUS WAIL 
Is heard! Then, violently BURSTING up through the ashes, a very angry GODZILLA emerges! 
Bleeding from his injuries, Godzilla leans down and nuzzles the burned out remains of his young. For the first time in the film we can SEE a partial expression of Godzilla's face; pain. 
But quickly that pain turns to burning anger as he focuses his hatred downwards, staring directly, and accusingly, at our heroes. 
NICK Ohhhhhhhh.....shit. 
ANIMAL What do we do? 
RAYMOND Running would be a good idea. 
And they do just as Godzilla POUNCES. Fortunately our team DARTS around a corner just in time. 
238  EXT. SIDE STREET - SAME                                    238 
As our heroes come rushing around a corner, Godzilla BURSTS THROUGH the building in front of them, sealing off their exit. Raymond notices a very narrow alley. 
ANGLE - ALLEY WAY 
Raymond leads them through this slim alley between to large brick buildings. They run for their lives as Godzilla appears behind them. 
His claws are too big to reach into the alley so he BULLDOZES his way into it, the building ripping apart as he marches forward. 
Bricks go FLYING as debris showers down on our team just they make their way to the other side. 
Slowed down by the the position of the alley, Godzilla SWINGS his arms violently to clear a path. 
239  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      239 
Racing from the alley Raymond races over to a parked YELLOW CAB. 
240  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS - SAME                               240 
In one deft move, Raymond draws a screwdriver out of his belt, pops the ignition device off the steering column and hot wires the car in under 15 seconds. It's amazing. 
As he does this the others pile into the car. Not even completely all in, Raymond takes off as soon as the engine turns over. Animal nearly falls out. 
241  EXT. 29TH STREET - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                      241 
Just as GODZILLA bursts out from between the buildings the CAB DARTS away, squealing around the next corner. 
242  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT                       242 
Power sliding around the wet street corner, the Yellow Cab FISHTAILS onto 8th Ave. Whipping around the corner behind them Godzilla appears. 
As he's MUCH faster, he nearly overtakes the car in a single LEAP but the cab SWERVES AGAIN moving down another street. 
243  EXT. 27TH STREET - SAME                                    243 
The cab darts onto 27th street. DEBRIS tumbles down in their path as GODZILLA SMASHES through another building. 
244  INT. CAB - SAME                                            244 
The rear window SHATTERS as falling bricks and debris HIT THE CAR. Again, the Cab darts down a small side street. 
245  EXT. LEWELLEN DRIVE - SAME                                 245 
Using this small cut-across, the cab quickly exits out onto the next main street (28th). Godzilla rushes down the side street, his TAIL shattering buildings as he does. 
246  INT. CAB - SAME                                            246 
Animal fumbles with his camera trying to get it to power up. The light goes ON and Animal quickly holsters it and begins filming out the shattered back window. 
AUDREY Cut uptown, take 8th to 57th then cut up Broadway. 
ANIMAL You're crazy, go to the east side and take the park avenue to the JFK. 
AUDREY The JFK? In the rain!? 
247  EXT. STREET - CAB & GODZILLA - NIGHT                       247 
LEAPING forward, Godzilla BITES down, SNAPPING at the cab as it SWERVES just out of danger, gunning it. 
248  INT. CAB - SAME - NIGHT                                    248 
ANIMAL What are you talking about? The east side is always faster. 
AUDREY But we can get to the west side faster. 
Through the rear window we SEE Godzilla SNAPPING down trying to take a bite. The cab, again, SWERVES wildly, darting down a side street. 
RAYMOND Somebody make up your mind! 
AUDREY & ANIMAL Take central park! 
249  EXT. 8TH AVENUE - SAME                                     249 
The cab SPINS, pulling a full 180 degree turn, and PEELS OUT just before Godzilla can SNAP DOWN again, just missing the cab. 
The cab PEELS around the creature and UP THE ONRAMP. 
Just then Godzilla LEAPS AFTER THEM. His jaw open, he BITES DOWN ON THE CAB. 
263  INT. CAB - CONTINUOUS                                      263 
Everyone ducks as the enormous JAWS OF THE CREATURE CLAMP DOWN OVER THE CAB. 
264  EXT. EXIT RAMP - SAME                                      264 
Taking a gigantic BITE out of the highway, some high tension wires and the support structure over the bridge, Godzilla CHOMPS DOWN on the cab. 
The large cement SIGN SLAMS into the roof of the creature's mouth, preventing him from crushing the cab with his teeth. 
265  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      265 
The sign supports will not hold much longer as it crumbles just above the cab. The torn electric cables DANGLING dangerous close to the cab. 
Godzilla PUSHES his TONGUE towards the back of the car, trying to draw it into his throat! 
266  INT. CAB                                                   266 
They're freaking out as the jaws are closing in on them. 
AUDREY Gun it! Gun it! 
RAYMOND I'm trying! 
C.U. CAB'S WHEELS 
Spinning in vain against the gigantic tongue that pushes against it, LIFTING the REAR of the vehicle. 
267  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA - SAME                             267 
Like a dog with a bone, Godzilla SHAKES his head trying to rip the rest of the highway free. The portion of highway in front of the cab TEARS FREE, lifting. 
268  INT. GODZILLA'S MOUTH                                      268 
From the cab we SEE the horizon LIFT as the road begins to give way. The sign above CRUMBLING FURTHER. 
Nick turns and SEES... 
ELECTRIC CABLES - SPARKS 
Sparking as they hit against the supports of the sign, Nicks sees the cables dangling close to the cab. He takes off his jacket, wraps it around his hand and opens the cab door. 
Grabbing the cable with his wrapped hand, he JAMS THE CABLE DOWN into Godzilla's TONGUE. SPARKS FLY! Nick leans back inside, slamming the door shut. 
269  EXT. HIGHWAY - GODZILLA                                    265 
He temporarily opens his mouth wider with a scream just before he is about to SLAM his jaws shut again... 
C.U. TIRES - SUDDENLY CATCHING 
As the tongue momentarily retreats from the SHOCK, the wheels CATCH and the CAB LURCHES FORWARD. 
270  EXT. GODZILLA - CONTINUOUS                                 270 
As the sign CRUMBLES and the JAWS CRUSH DOWN, the cab SAILS OUT OF HIS MOUTH as the beast SWALLOWS the piece of highway. 
Landing, hard, onto the pavement, the cab PEELS OUT, burning rubber as it enters the George Washington Bridge. 
Godzilla SWALLOWS only to realize he didn't get them. Seeing the cab on the bridge Godzilla gives chase. 
271  EXT. GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE                              271 
The cab races towards us when Godzilla STEPS ONTO THE BRIDGE. His enormous weight makes the entire bridge WOBBLE. 
The Cab goes airborne then bottoms out as it returns to the asphalt as the bridge undulates beneath them. It's as though they were driving during an earthquake. 
With each stride Godzilla takes, the bridge becomes more unstable. 
272  EXT. SKIES ABOVE THE HUDSON - F-18'S - SAME                272 
Swooping down the F-18's head directly towards the bridge. We see Godzilla about to overtake the Cab. 
273  INT. COCKPIT                                               273 
The HUD begins to FLASH, LOCKED ON! 
PILOT #2 We are red and free. Stallion 10, Fox 
274  EXT. BRIDGE - CAB AND GODZILLA                             274 
Only a stride away from being overtaken. 
275  INT. OTHER COCKPIT - SAME                                  275 
PILOT #3 Stallion 12, Fox 2. 
ANGLE - F-18 SQUADRON 
All at once they FIRE. Missiles heading right at camera. 
GODZILLA 
opens his mighty jaw about to CLAMP DOWN on them.

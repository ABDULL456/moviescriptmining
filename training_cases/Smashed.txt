OVER BLACK: 
CLINKING GLASSES and other assorted BAR SOUNDS. 
KARAOKE ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Let's give a hand to Rodney! 
Scattered APPLAUSE and LAUGHTER. 
KARAOKE ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Next up, we've got a little lady named...KATE! 
Joyful APPLAUSE. 
BAR VOICES (V.O.) Yeah, Kate! 
THE OPENING MUZAK STRAINS OF A "KARAOKE SONG TO BE DETERMINED" 
FADE IN: 
1   INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT                                     1 
CLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and,     * oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny 
KARAOKE STAGE 
in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar. 
Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke version of "SONG TO BE DETERMINED." What Kate lacks in talent she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm. 
At a table near the stage is -- 
-- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but      * handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with -- 
-- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's --       * who sings along with -- 
-- the small but energetic CROWD. 
Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the Queen of Karaoke. 
LATER 
Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to join Charlie and Owen. 
CHARLIE That was so good, baby! 
KATE Bullshit. 
CHARLIE I'm serious. You sing like an angel -- a drunk angel. 
Owen and Kate LAUGH. 
KATE If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say? 
CHARLIE I'd say that, uh...my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive. 
KATE That would be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it. 
Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at Owen and makes a puppy dog face. 
KATE (CONT'D) (to Owen) Aw...we need to find you a lady, Owen. 
OWEN Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt with the bartender, but...I can't tell. 
Owen motions to the -- 
-- FEMALE BARTENDER, early 20's.                                * 
KATE She's hot! What can't you tell? 
5    EXT. DOWNTOWN - SIDEWALK - DAWN                               5 
Kate is asleep on the curb. She looks awful. Suddenly, Kate's eyes widen. She looks around at her surroundings, confused, then jumps to her feet. 
6    EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN                                6 
Kate runs through the streets. 
6A   EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN                               6A   * 
We TRACK along with Kate as she dashes past various               * buildings.                                                        * 
6B   EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - DAWN                                6B   * 
We stare down a long, empty street, the downtown SKYSCRAPERS      * towering in the distance. From out of nowhere --                  * 
-- Kate appears at the end of the street and sprints towards      * the camera.                                                       * 
A LEGEND APPEARS OVER THE IMAGE OF KATE RUNNING: 
"SMASHED" 
7    INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAWN                              7 
Kate drives -- a paranoid expression on her face and her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. She glances down at -- 
-- her CELL PHONE in the passenger seat. 21 missed calls. 
She passes various sites on her way from downtown to Highland     * Park.                                                             * 
8   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - MORNING                         8 
Kate slowly pulls into the driveway of a small, cute house. 
9   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/HALLWAY/KITCHEN - 9     * MORNING 
Kate walks into the kitchen to find -- 
-- Charlie asleep at the kitchen table. CELL PHONE next to his head. Empty BEER BOTTLES litter the table. 
Kate tip-toes across the kitchen. 
Charlie quickly jerks up. 
CHARLIE (confused) Huh?! 
KATE Shhh...it's okay, baby. Go back to sleep. 
CHARLIE What happened? I came home and you were gone and I waited and waited. 
KATE It's a long story. 
CHARLIE I was worried. I kept calling you. 
KATE I ended up... 
Charlie SNIFFS Kate. 
CHARLIE You smell funny. What do you smell like? 
KATE I fell asleep in my car. Near the bar. I was too drunk to drive. 
CHARLIE So, why didn't you come back or call me? 
KATE Charlie -- (beat) -- I'm fine. 
CHARLIE Well, maybe I'm not. I worry, baby. I love you -- and you know how you get sometimes. 
KATE I love you too. But I'm home. It's over. I gotta get to work. 
CHARLIE I can't be worried about you all the time. 
Kate rubs Charlie's hair and kisses his forehead. 
KATE Don't worry so much. I'm fine. (beat) C'mon -- let me get you to bed. 
Hillary shuffles up to the board and writes "CAN."              * 
KATE (CONT'D) Great job, Hillary -- let's give                      * her a round of applause! 
The class APPLAUDS. 
Hillary smiles and goes back to her seat.                       * 
KATE (CONT'D) Can anyone use "can" in a sentence? 
A student -- ANGELA -- raises her hand. 
KATE (CONT'D) Yes? 
ANGELA "Hurry up in there -- I gotta use the can!" 
The students GIGGLE. 
KATE (quickly moving on) Wonderful, Angela. You get a Camaro with flames painted on the hood. 
The students CHEER. 
KATE (CONT'D) Now -- (to the class) -- what's another word I could make by adding a letter to "an"? 
Nobody raises their hand. 
KATE (CONT'D) C'mon... 
Finally, a student in the back -- RAMON -- raises his hand. 
KATE (CONT'D) Yes -- Ramon? 
RAMON P. 
KATE P...okay, what word would that make if I added a "P"? 
RAMON Um...pan? 
KATE Pan! That's right. Ramon Martinez...COME ON DOWN! 
Ramon walks up and begins to write "PAN." 
KATE (CONT'D) Wow! Just look at that excellent penman -- 
Kate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth. She quickly runs behind her desk, leans over, and discretely -- 
-- VOMITS on the floor! 
Ramon -- who's just inches from the pool of vomit -- looks horrified. 
Kate glances up from behind her desk to see -- 
-- the kids all make grossed-out faces and say things like -- 
KIDS EW! GRODY! GROSS! YUCK! IT SMELLS LIKE CHEESE! SLOPPY JOE! GRANDPA! SHRIMP! BACON! 
Embarrassed, Kate quickly gets TISSUES from her desk and begins cleaning up the mess. 
KATE (to the class) I'm so sorry you had to see that. 
HILLARY stands up.                                                * 
HILLARY                                       * Mrs. Hannah -- are you pregnant? 
KATE What? 
HILLARY                                       * My mommy threw up when she was pregnant with my little sister. Are you pregnant? 
Some of the kids begin WHISPERING (saying things like "Ooh!" "She's gonna have a baby."). 
RAMON Are you? 
Kate seems flustered and says -- 
KATE Yes. 
KATE Yeah, well...I'm really embarrassed -- but I feel a lot better. And I just wanted to say thank you. 
Mr. Davies glances down the hall. 
MR. DAVIES Look -- I'm not a fool. (whispered) I know you were drinking this morning. 
Kate looks shocked. 
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D) I saw you. 
KATE (taken aback) Oh, no, I... 
MR. DAVIES Drinking when you're pregnant is really dangerous. 
KATE I know that! Oh, God, I... (long beat) ...listen -- I'm not actually pregnant. 
MR. DAVIES What? 
KATE I'm just really hung over. The kids started asking me questions after I vomited and I panicked. 
MR. DAVIES Oh. That's...not good. 
KATE I know. I...please don't say anything. 
Mr. Davies looks torn, unsure how to respond. 
MR. DAVIES Just...go home. Get some sleep. 
Before Kate can say a word, Mr. Davies heads back into the classroom. 
17   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - DAY                      17 
Kate has her face fully in the sink while water runs over it and -- 
-- TWO LITTLE GIRLS curiously watch. 
18   INT. NEIGHBORHOOD BAR - DAY                                  18   * 
Kate and Charlie play POOL while splitting a PITCHER OF BEER. It's a bit early to be drinking, but hey -- why not? 
KATE I had such a crappy morning. 
CHARLIE Me too. I spent like three hours at the post office trying to buy stamps and stuff. 
Kate takes a long sip of beer. 
KATE I told my class I was pregnant. 
Charlie looks up at Kate with a beaming smile. He leans over and grabs her hand. 
CHARLIE (excited and sort of confused) Oh, baby, that's -- 
KATE I'm not. Pregnant. So don't worry. 
CHARLIE (deflated) Oh. (beat) `Cause it would be great news -- if it was true. (beat) `Course then I'd have to drink your beer... 
KATE Well, it was a lie. I just lied to my class. After barfing in front of them. 
CHARLIE (cringes) Ooh... 
KATE Yeah, that's what they said. (long beat) Listen...I can't do this anymore. 
A look of complete terror and confusion passes over Charlie's face. 
CHARLIE What do you mean? 
KATE I dunno. I think I might...drink too much. 
Charlie LAUGHS. 
CHARLIE Oh. That. Yeah...you kinda do. 
Charlie swigs his beer. 
KATE I know I do -- I'm a fucking mess... 
KATE Yeah, right. 
CHARLIE Remember when I was shit-faced and took that Q & A pamphlet from there? 
KATE (laughs) Holy shit! And we answered "yes" to like every question and at the end it was like, "If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic!" 
CHARLIE Yeah... (nostalgic) ...that was fun, wasn't it? 
Kate smiles and nods. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Hey -- 
Charlie gestures to the street. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) -- look out for that crack! 
Kate looks down but sees nothing. 
KATE What crack? 
CHARLIE Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a crack there... (grins) ...but you must have smoked it last night. 
Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away. Kate chases after him. 
20   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER           20 
While an old 70's R & B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS -- 
-- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and        * LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET. 
CHARLIE "Have you missed days of work or school because of drinking?" 
KATE Absolutely. 
CHARLIE "Do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble?" 
KATE Envy isn't exactly the right word... 
CHARLIE "Do you have `blackouts'?" 
KATE Yeah, but who doesn't? 
CHARLIE "Has your drinking caused trouble at home?" 
KATE No! We're great. 
CHARLIE Yeah. Definitely. But we still had a lot of "yes" answers. (refers to pamphlet) Yep...we still qualify as drunks. 
KATE I'm gonna go! 
CHARLIE (disbelief) Yeah, right. 
KATE No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go. What time is it? 
CHARLIE Eight. 
Kate gets up. 
KATE See ya. 
CHARLIE (doesn't believe her) Uh-huh... 
Kate takes a big sip of wine. 
KATE (quite serious) This is me: going. 
Charlie LAUGHS -- he doesn't buy it. 
CHARLIE You've been boozing. 
KATE So? You should come too! 
Charlie LAUGHS. 
CHARLIE Yeah, right. You can't go to AA wasted. It's like a rule or something. 
KATE (not picking up the hint) I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything... 
Kate nervously LAUGHS. 
Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate. 
TATTOO MAN Thank you -- we're all here to help. We do have to move on, though. 
The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down. 
LILY                                      * Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be plenty of time to tell your story. 
A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium. 
AMBER Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't really believe that it's been five years. I mean, my life was a mess back then. Now I'm back in school, I have an amazing man, I love my parents -- it's crazy... 
KATE (way too loud) How old is that girl?! Can she even go to bars? (to Amber) How old are you, Amber? 
SHANA                                      * Be respectful. 
Kate seems surprised at being chastised. 
AMBER (gaining intensity) Um...okay? It's because I did the work. I got down on my knees and prayed every night! I went to a meeting everyday! 
KATE Everyday? 
AMBER It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say, I owe everything to AA. Well, AA -- and God, of course! 
The whole room APPLAUDS. 
LATER 
Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY PRAYER. 
EVERYONE God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change -- courage to change the things I can - - and wisdom to know the difference. 
KATE AMEN! 
Everyone turns and looks at Kate. 
KATE (CONT'D) (embarrassed) Okay...I think I'm good. 
Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived. 
22   EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT               22 
Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER. 
KATE So much for that. 
Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss- crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN FURNITURE. 
They drunkenly play CROQUET.                                      * 
CHARLIE Was it a bunch of old biker guys? 
KATE No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE! 
CHARLIE Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm sorry it wasn't cool. 
Charlie thinks for a moment. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) I can't really imagine never drinking. I guess I don't have to, though -- (beat) -- you're the one with the problem. 
Kate nods in agreement.                                           * 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Hey -- I love you. I don't want you to have to drink. 
KATE I don't have to drink. (beat) I just really like to drink.                            * 
CHARLIE (sincere) Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world. 
Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment, and then Kate... 
...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate grins mischievously. 
CLERK Look -- why don't you get a bottle of water or a coffee or something instead? 
KATE Water or coffee? Fuck you. What -- just cause I won't suck your dick? 
CLERK (had enough) Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you gotta go. 
Kate doesn't budge. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Seriously, Kate. You should go. 
KATE Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! 
Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with tears. 
KATE (CONT'D) This is bullshit! (beat) I have to pee. 
Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door - - but it's locked. She hides from view, and then squats down and begins to pull up her robe. 
CLERK What the fuck are you doing?! 
KATE (caught) I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just have to pee really, really bad.                         * 
CLERK (frustrated) Get outta here NOW! 
KATE (pleads) C'mon...can't we drink together? 
The clerk clearly isn't going to budge. Kate nods, resigned, and then... 
...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door. 
27   EXT. L.A. RIVER - DAWN                                       27 
Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her. 
Kate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby. 
A bird SQUAWKS. 
Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike. 
28   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING              28 
Kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and realizes that -- 
-- it's 7:30. 
She jumps out of bed in a panic. 
KATE Charlie! 
Kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet. She looks down at the bed, which is -- 
-- COMPLETELY SOAKED. 
KATE (CONT'D) (mumbled) Not again. 
Half-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of the bed. 
CHARLIE Come back to bed, baby. 
KATE I have to go to work. You snoozed my alarm again. I'm gonna be late. 
CHARLIE Well, you peed on me so I guess                     * we're even.                                         * 
KATE I have a weak bladder. 
CHARLIE Well...I can't go to work like this. 
KATE You work from our kitchen. 
CHARLIE Yeah, but changing the sheets is my real job. (beat) Hey -- where were you last night? 
KATE Huh? 
CHARLIE I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you were gone. 
KATE (CONT'D) I puked in front of my class and then told everyone I'm pregnant. That's not really okay, huh? 
MR. DAVIES No, I don't think so. 
KATE I went to AA last night. 
MR. DAVIES (slightly uncomfortable) Oh, yeah? What'd you think of it? 
KATE It was awful. I kept getting shushed. 
MR. DAVIES I don't normally tell people I work with this... but -- 
Mr. Davies takes a COIN that says "Nine Years" out of his pocket and shows it to Kate. 
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D) -- I'm a bit of an expert when it comes to these things. 
KATE (shocked) You? 
MR. DAVIES Yeah, me. I've lived a strange one.                    * I'm nine years sober, AA and NA. (beat) I used to drink cocaine. (off Kate's shocked expression) It's really cheap in the Philippines. 
Mr. Davies takes a beat to think about what he's saying. 
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D) Listen, Kate. I know meetings can be weird. Especially at first, but if you want to...you never need to feel like you have to...but the ones I go to are pretty small. Nice little groups. (beat) I'd be happy to take you. 
KATE Maybe that would be good...I don't know. 
MR. DAVIES No pressure, okay. That shit saved my life, though. 
Principal Barnes walks in. 
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D) (switching gears) Well, I'm scheduled to observe Ms. Carol's art class. They're making macaroni art, so...I'm pretty stoked. 
Mr. Davies gets up to leave -- discretely winking at Kate as he exits. 
Principal Barnes watches Mr. Davies leave, a puzzled expression on her face. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES (to Kate) Mrs. Hannah -- I've got something for you... 
Principal Barnes opens the MINI FRIDGE to reveal a huge jug of ORANGE JUICE. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D) Folic Acid! You need it now like never before. 
KATE (beat) Thanks. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES I bet your mother is over the moon, huh? Probably planning you a baby shower...? 
KATE Oh, well...she and I aren't that close. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES Oh, I'm sorry. Well, listen -- any motherly thing you need -- I'm                       * here, okay? 
Barnes hands Kate a large glass of juice. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D) Now drink up -- that baby in there's thirsty! 
KATE Okay. (takes a sip of orange juice) And...you're kinda the only person at school -- besides Mr. Davies -- who knows I'm pregnant. Could you...? 
PRINCIPAL BARNES My lips are -- 
Principal Barnes mimes "zipping" her lips. 
32   EXT./INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY 
Kate walks in the front door to see    --                      * 
-- Charlie working on his computer. A BEER next to him. An old record PLAYS on the record player. 
KATE Hey... 
CHARLIE Howdy. 
Kate collapses on the couch next to Charlie and kisses him. 
KATE How was your day? And what's that smell? 
CHARLIE Eh -- alright. Couldn't find oatmeal so I made ketchup soup. 
43   EXT. JENNY'S CATERING BUSINESS - NIGHT                       43   * 
Kate -- who eats a piece of CAKE -- sits on a patio with          * Jenny, Mr. Davies, and several other PEOPLE from AA.              * 
JENNY                                         * I'm really proud of you, Kate. 
KATE I kinda can't believe it's been ninety days. (beat) The longest I've gone since high school without drinking was, like, a week. 
MR. DAVIES My first three months were such hell. I think I'm only sober today because I just never want to go through that again. 
KATE It's weird -- in after-school specials the getting-sober part was only like a minute of the movie and suddenly...daddy's all okay. 
Several people LAUGH. 
KATE (CONT'D) But it's so fucking hard and weird and suddenly I have all these other problems now that drinking isn't the problem. 
JENNY                          * Like what?                                  * 
KATE Everything else. Work, my non- existent relationship with my mom... 
JENNY                             * When was the last time you saw her? 
KATE (tries to remember) A year, at least. 
JENNY                             * Well...maybe it's time. 
KATE Maybe. (beat) And then there's my marriage. I mean, Charlie's great. Really great, he's supportive, especially at first. It's strange, though. I feel like alcohol was the thing that connected us and now that I don't drink we lead these two very different lives. (beat) We haven't slept together in forever... (laughs) I haven't pissed myself in awhile, though. So that's good. 
JENNY                             * It takes time. 
Kate gives an exasperated look. 
JENNY (CONT'D)                    * (half-stern cheerleader tone) Keep working the steps. (glances at her watch) Let's grab coffee tomorrow, okay? I should actually run you home now and come back. I need to start locking up. 
KATE I could stick around and help you... 
MR. DAVIES (to Kate) I could take you home. (off Kate's reaction) If you want. 
44   INT./EXT. MR. DAVIES' CAR - NIGHT                 44   * 
Mr. Davies pulls up to Kate's house. 
MR. DAVIES My ex-wife -- she doesn't drink -- well, not like us, but as soon as I got sober I started to change and she just...didn't. 
KATE I didn't know you were married. 
Beat. 
MR. DAVIES Yeah, I was married once -- (laughs) -- in my other life. But I shouldn't be talking to you about this stuff. 
KATE Why? 
MR. DAVIES I don't know... 
KATE Because you're a dude we can't talk? I don't get that "men stick with men, women stick with women" stuff. 
MR. DAVIES Well, if you were sitting where I'm sitting you'd understand. 
KATE Are you trying to tell me that you have a crush on me? 
MR. DAVIES What am I, one of your students?            * Crush? 
KATE Yeah, crush. 
MR. DAVIES (long beat) I kind of do, yes. I have a crush on you. I know that's wrong -- you're newly sober and married and I shouldn't be thinking about you like that. But yeah, I should put that out on the table. (beat) Honesty. 
KATE It's okay. I think you're a really good guy. 
MR. DAVIES Oh, great -- good guys are the nerds that carry the pretty girls' books. 
KATE Oh, c'mon... 
MR. DAVIES I think you're beautiful. 
Kate smiles bashfully. 
CHARLIE Well then why're you going? 
KATE (beat) We send her checks. But we never actually see her. Sometimes it feels like I'm paying her to not be in my life. I thought it would be nice to visit her. (beat) And Jenny thinks it would be a good         * idea. 
Charlie LAUGHS. 
KATE (CONT'D) What? 
CHARLIE I don't know...I mean, do you do everything your sponsor tells you to do? 
KATE No. Do you think I'm brainwashed or something? 
CHARLIE I dunno...it's been a long damn time since you've seen your mom. (beat) And you didn't listen when I suggested we visit her. 
KATE (suddenly gets that it's an ego thing for Charlie) Oh, baby -- I listen to you. This just...it felt like the right time. (beat) With all the changes I'm going through. 
CHARLIE Well, can I come with you? It'll be like a little vacation. 
KATE Um...I think I should go alone. 
CHARLIE Come on, if you do that you'll just get depressed. If I go we can try to make it fun. Go hiking and stuff. 
KATE Well, if you go, don't take this the wrong way but -- I'd like it if maybe you didn't drink. (beat) Just while we're there. 
CHARLIE (smiles) I think I can handle not drinking for like a day. 
Kate smiles and snuggles up into Charlie's arms. 
46   INT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY                           46 
Kate and Charlie drive and listen to MUSIC.

48    INT./EXT. SUBARU - LAKE ARROWHEAD - RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY 
Kate and Charlie are parked in front of a -- 
-- HOUSE. Small. A little run-down. Sort of a vague ski cabin look. There's some dirty lawn furniture in the front yard as well as a DOZEN LAWN-GNOMES. 
CHARLIE Ah...the lawn-gnomes. I missed those guys. 
Kate playfully punches Charlie in the shoulder. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) (waving to a lawn-gnome) Hi, Holger! 
Kate LAUGHS. Long beat. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) So...we gonna go in? 
Charlie glances at Kate and reads the anxiety on her face. 
49    EXT. KATE'S MOTHER'S HOME - DAY                              49 
Kate and Charlie walk to the front door. 
KATE (unsettled) I should've brought something. 
CHARLIE You're fine. 
KATE Something, you know? Flowers, or... 
CHARLIE Wine? 
KATE No. Definitely not that. 
They get to the door. Charlie looks at Kate -- who seems like she'd be okay if they ran back to the car. 
KATE (CONT'D) (conceding) Go on... 
Charlie KNOCKS. 
FEMALE VOICE (O.S.) S'minute! 
KATE No -- you don't have to do that. I didn't even tell him. But...you can't say that to a girl -- like, ever. 
MR. DAVIES Okay. 
KATE Seriously. Consider that a rule of thumb. (beat) Someday, you're gonna meet a nice, available lady -- but if you say "moist pussy" to her, you will never, ever, ever get to see that part of her body! 
MR. DAVIES (even more embarrassed) Okay. (beat) Thank you. (nods) I feel like this was a really good talk. 
Kate forces a smile. 
55   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT             55 
Kate stares at a -- 
-- HALF-EATEN BIRTHDAY CAKE ("OWEN" is still sort of legible) on the kitchen table. It's totally mutilated. 
She walks out the back door into the                            * 
BACKYARD                                                        *

GREG                                       * ...getting married would fucking                     * suck. I can't even imagine waking                    * up to the same person for the rest                   * of my life.                                          * 
Kate walks out.                                                 * GREG (CONT'D)                           OWEN What's up, Kate?                Hey, Kate. 
KATE                                       * I see you guys found the birthday                    * cake Jenny and I baked.                              * 
OWEN                                       * Yeah, thanks! You should get a                       * slice.                                               *

CHARLIE                            * Baby -- I didn't even think about            * that. I'm sorry.                             * 
OWEN                               * It was really good.                          * 
GREG                               * We have plenty of tequila to make            * up for the cake.                             * 
OWEN                               * Kate's in AA -- so she can't drink.          * She hasn't drank in forever -- like          * thirty-eight days or some shit.              * 
KATE                               * Ninety-five days, actually.                  * 
GREG                               * That sucks! Do you still smoke               * weed?                                        * 
KATE                               * No, I wasn't a big weed smoker               * anyway.                                      * 
OWEN                               * You smoked crack though, didn't              * you?                                         * 
Kate's face goes blank. She stares at Charlie.         * 
GREG                               * Shit -- I hear crack gets you so             * high!                                        * 
CHARLIE                            * No -- my wife doesn't smoke crack.           * Jesus...                                     * 
OWEN                               * What? I'm joking around. I know              * Kate's not a crackhead or some               * shit.                                        * (to Kate)                                * It was just that one time, right?            * 
KATE                                          * (angry; to Charlie)                                 * Thanks, Charlie.                                        *

57   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM/BATHROOM - NIGHT -     57   * MOMENTS LATER 
Charlie walks in to see Kate getting ready to go to bed.          * 
TOBY Mrs. Hannah -- are you going to hell? 
KATE No! I didn't kill my baby! Okay, listen kids -- we shouldn't be talking about this. But... (beat) ...sometimes women get pregnant and then early on -- before it's even a baby -- they stop being pregnant. 
WINNIE                               * Because a doctor murders it! 
KATE No -- not because a doctor   murdered it. (beat) It's called a miscarriage.   That means it wasn't my plan --   it's just what happened. (composes herself) Does anyone want to ask me   any questions? 
The class nods but seems silently freaked out. 
KATE (CONT'D) Let's get back to subtraction -- or addition. Or both. 
59   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - TEACHERS' LOUNGE - DAY        59 
Kate sits with Mr. Davies eating lunch. 
MR. DAVIES Well, that was bound to happen at some point. Kids notice things like that. 
Kate nods. 
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D) But I had no idea how pro-life little Winnie Reddy is.                        * (beat) Remind me to wear my "May the fetus you save be gay" T-shirt to the next banana split night. 
Kate half-laughs. 
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D) And just think: the kids got a lesson about life and death that nobody planned on. I mean, you're years ahead of the standard curriculum for, uh, third graders. 
KATE Does it matter that I lied? That I was never pregnant? 
MR. DAVIES You want me to answer that as a friend or as someone who takes the twelve steps very seriously? 
Kate shrugs. 
MR. DAVIES (CONT'D) Well, the good thing is that it's all over now. Principal Barnes will think you're a martyr for losing a baby. (beat) The kids won't ask about it anymore and as long as you don't toss your cookies again you won't have to deal with it. 
KATE (long beat) And the bad news? 
MR. DAVIES You lied. To your boss -- and a bunch of small children. Who trust you. And rely on you to help them differentiate right from wrong. 
KATE (slowly nods) That's all, huh? 
60   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/DINING          60   * ROOM/KITCHEN/BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   * 
Kate and Charlie eat TAKE-OUT FOOD in SILENCE. Kate texts on her CELL PHONE -- not even paying attention to Charlie. 
CHARLIE Well... (beat) (MORE) 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) ...I gotta say -- this is the boringest meal I've had in about as long as I can remember. 
Kate doesn't look up. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Who're you texting? 
KATE (still looking down) Jenny.                                      * 
CHARLIE She's like a parole officer. 
KATE She's my sponsor. 
CHARLIE I'm glad to know every little fuck- up I have is gonna become a topic of conversation with some chick I don't even know. 
Kate finishes her text. Puts down her phone. 
KATE (fake enthusiasm) So...what'd you do today, honey? 
CHARLIE I finished some writing and met up with Owen to watch the game and toss a few back. Dear. (beat) You do anything special? 
KATE I lied to my class again. I told them that I had a miscarriage. 
Charlie LAUGHS. 
KATE (CONT'D) That's not funny. 
CHARLIE Yeah, it is. Telling kids fucked-up stuff is totally funny...in, you know -- a kinda fucked-up way. 
KATE Great, well -- I'm glad I'm not actually having a baby. 
JENNY                             * Yeah, steps -- and talking and listening and crying... 
KATE I have the crying part covered. 
JENNY                            * I know, right? I think my first year I cried tears I'd been saving since I was eight. (beat) It's hard to live your life...honestly. You know? 
Kate nods. 
JENNY (CONT'D)                   * Any idea what you're gonna do about your school situation? What you're gonna say? 
Kate shakes her head. 
KATE I don't know what I'm gonna do about anything. 
JENNY                                         * Listen...you wanna stay in my guest                     * room tonight? You can watch movies, get some good sleep...? 
KATE You sure that's okay? 
JENNY                                        * Yeah, of course. That's why I spent money on a guest bed -- so people could sleep in it. (beat) I know it might feel like it, but really, you don't have to figure everything out tonight. (smiles) You've got time. 
62   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY                     62 
Kate goes into her classroom and finds a NOTE on the desk. 
63   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY            63 
Principal Barnes hugs Kate. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES I'm so sorry, Kate. (beat) I haven't told many people this, but when I was young -- younger than you...I lost a child too. 
Kate's stunned. Looks like she feels terrible. 
KATE I'm...I'm really sorry. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES It's okay. It was a long, long time ago. Still hurts sometimes. But eventually...you move on. You have to. (beat) Have a seat. 
Kate sits down. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES (CONT'D) I got a phone call from a very upset parent. That's how I found out about...you know. Frankly, I'm not sure why you didn't feel like you could tell me. 
KATE I freaked out -- a student asked why I wasn't fat and I just froze up and then another student was saying I killed my baby and I didn't know what to do. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES I'm not angry with you -- but I need to be clear that this doesn't happen again. 
KATE It won't. I promise that. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES By "not happening again," I mean that you don't discuss any controversial topics -- things the school board deems "family matters" with your class. (beat) No sex. No god. No drugs and alcohol. 
KATE Okay, I... 
Kate straightens up in her seat, takes a deep breath. She seems...exhausted. 
KATE (CONT'D) ...I can't keep doing this. I feel awful. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES (confused) I know this all must be hard for you -- 
KATE No. You don't understand. (beat) I have to be honest with you. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES What do you mean? 
KATE Principal Barnes...I wasn't ever pregnant. 
Principal Barnes looks shocked. 
KATE (CONT'D) I lied -- to the class and to you -- because I was scared. 
PRINCIPAL BARNES But...you vomited in class. 
KATE I know. And when that happened I didn't know what to do because the truth is -- 
PRINCIPAL BARNES Oh, my god -- are you really ill? Is it cancer? 
KATE No, well, yes. I have a disease, but, um... (beat) ...it's alcoholism. 
Principal Barnes goes from concerned -- to angry. 
Mr. Davies awkwardly puts his arm around Kate's shoulder. 
MR. DAVIES I'm sorry. I wish there was something I could do. 
KATE I'm a fuck-up. I'll always be a fuck up. I'm just like my mom. 
MR. DAVIES (confused) No, no -- you're a wonderful, smart woman Kate. You can't let this get you down. 
KATE I gotta go. 
Mr. Davies takes Kate's box of things from her. 
MR. DAVIES Let me walk you to your car. 
Kate throws her arms around Mr. Davies and begins to -- 
-- full-on SOB. 
Mr. Davies seems flustered and a little scared but tries to comfort Kate. 
65   INT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAY                                   65 
Kate cries as she drives. 
She glances in the backseat at -- 
-- all the baby shower gifts -- 
-- and sobs even harder. 
66   INT. DIVE BAR - DAY                                          66 
Kate walks into a near-empty, depressing dive. She nervously sits at the bar. 
The BARTENDER -- a gruff looking guy with the sleeves rolled      * up -- approaches. 
BARTENDER What do you need? 
KATE Whiskey. Double. 
The bartender gives Kate her drink. Kate immediately downs it. 
KATE (CONT'D) Can I have another one? 
BARTENDER Sure -- you gotta pay for the first one, though. Eight bucks. 
Kate puts a TWENTY DOLLAR BILL down. 
The bartender pours her another shot. 
LATER 
Kate has clearly been drinking for awhile -- she's curled up at the bar, nursing her BEER. 
BARTENDER (CONT'D) Look, Miss -- I don't wanna be a downer or anything `cause I take it you've had a bad day, but um... I think you need to go home. 
KATE Why? 
BARTENDER Cause you're pretty drunk -- and it's four p.m. 
KATE What about him? 
Kate points to an old CRUSTY MAN at the other end of the bar. 
KATE (CONT'D) You're not kicking him out. 
BARTENDER I'm just trying to be a pal. 
KATE Stop it -- you aren't my pal. I just got fired, and I just quit AA. (beat) It didn't work. 
BARTENDER Oh, boy... 
KATE You know what? I was fine -- had a husband that loved me and maybe I sometimes did embarrassing stuff, but it was a phase. (MORE) 
KATE (CONT'D) I go to AA and sober my husband and I start fighting and stop fucking -- and sober I get fired! Isn't that what's supposed to not happen? 
-- Kate stumbles to her front door. 
JENNY                                     * Kate! Are you sure you're -- 
KATE (over her shoulder) Fuck off.

Charlie plays a VIDEO GAME -- with the TV hooked up through his STEREO SPEAKERS. 
Kate opens the doors and walks in, wobbly. 
CHARLIE (not looking up) Babe -- you gotta hear this with the speakers hooked up. It's insane. 
Kate says nothing. Just stares at Charlie. 
Charlie looks up -- and is surprised to see Kate clearly drunk. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Whoa...what happened to you? 
Charlie stops playing the game. 
KATE I'm drunk. I'm fired from my job. 
CHARLIE Oh, no... 
KATE We got any drinks? 
CHARLIE Uh...we have soda. I can make coffee. 
KATE Don't be cute with me. You know what I mean. 
CHARLIE So...I guess you aren't doing the AA thing anymore? 
KATE What gave that away? 
Kate turns and goes to the kitchen -- 
-- reappearing a moment later with a BOTTLE OF TEQUILA, salt and limes. 
KATE (CONT'D) Come on, baby -- let's do some shots. 
CHARLIE What's going on? 
KATE I'm celebrating. What the fuck does it look like? 
Kate takes a shot. 
KATE (CONT'D) Are you gonna be a little girl or are you gonna drink with me? 
CHARLIE I don't know what the right thing to do here is. 
KATE Okay, so let me see if this makes sense: you say you miss the old Kate -- the Kate who drinks and blacks out and has fun. (beat) Well...here she is. 
Kate smiles -- but she looks more desperate and drunk than fun. 
CHARLIE Baby, I didn't mean that. I was just being a jerk. 
KATE Fuck yeah you were. And what? Now you won't drink with me? 
CHARLIE I don't know. Having a beer or something is one thing, but...I think you really may have a problem. 
Kate LAUGHS. 
KATE Well thanks for all the support when I was trying to be sober! 
Kate takes another shot. 
CHARLIE I'm sorry. I didn't realize -- 
KATE Of course you didn't realize! You don't fucking care about me. 
CHARLIE What are you talking about?! Of course I care about you. I love you. 
Kate takes a shot and approaches Charlie. 
KATE (proud) Thanks. 
71   INT. CHURCH - AA MEETING ROOM - NIGHT                          71 
A middle-aged MAN stands at a podium in front of a medium sized group of PEOPLE -- about twenty-five or so, including Kate, Jenny, and Mr. Davies -- and says --                          * 
CHUCK                                          * At this meeting we give cakes to celebrate sober birthdays. We have one birthday tonight -- for Kate, for one year. (beat) Jenny and Dave are giving her the                         * cake. 
Kate hugs everyone -- then blows out ONE CANDLE on a CAKE before standing at the podium. 
KATE Hey, I'm Kate, alcoholic. 
GROUP Hi, Kate. 
KATE I've heard that your best day drinking is worse than your worst day sober. (beat) Well...that is SO not true! I had amazing times drinking, dancing, and laughing...feeling like the most adorable, charming girl in the world. And I was adorable. (beat) I'd piss my pants, but I was still cute. 
People in the crowd LAUGH a little bit. 
KATE (CONT'D) When I first tried getting sober, I figured that as long as I didn't drink...everything else would just magically work out. But it didn't. (beat) My marriage fell apart. I got fired from my job. And that shit happened SOBER! I never read that in any pamphlet... (shakes her head) ...that isn't what I signed up for. (beat) Um...so, I relapsed. Another shitty slogan I've heard in the rooms is that when you're sober for a bit and drink again "the disease waits for you, picks up where it left off." (beat) I'm sorry you guys, but I HATE those slogans. They all sound like bumper stickers. But, I have to admit...for me, that last one is pretty damn true. (beat) When I drink...I become another person. And that person is a pretty big asshole. Well, unless you want to give me drugs or buy me drinks -- then that person is awesome. 
People knowingly LAUGH. 
KATE (CONT'D) I wasn't happy being the "good-time girl," though. And honestly, I wasn't very good at it. (MORE) 
KATE (CONT'D) (beat) My life is really different than it was a year ago. I live alone. I'm bored a lot more. I have a job that pays a lot less. (beat) I'm thankful for the program -- for my friends in here who took the time to help me and give a shit about me. 
Kate glances at Jenny and Mr. Davies.                             * 
KATE (CONT'D) There are people that used to be a part of my life that I miss -- a lot -- but... (long beat) ...I'm really grateful for this boring new life of mine. 
Kate smiles and steps down from the podium as people CLAP. 
72   INT. BAR - NIGHT                                             72   * 
Charlie, Owen, and a woman -- MILLIE -- stand at the bar, drinking BEER and WHISKEY SHOTS. Owen speaks -- but Millie seems way more into Charlie. 
OWEN I was in North Carolina for a while                     * -- Durham -- playing minor league ball. I had some real heat. That's when I met Crash, here. (gestures to Charlie) He'd been sent down to single-A to teach me how to carry myself as a pro ball-player. We got involved with the same woman -- an older chick -- but Crash won her in the end. (beat) He's really taught me some...important life-lessons. 
Millie nods. 
MILLIE Wow...that's a pretty crazy way to meet. 
OWEN Yeah. It is. 
MILLIE You guys are sorta like that movie...what's it called? 
OWEN (plays dumb) I don't know. Which one? (to Charlie) Do you know what movie she means? 
Charlie -- who's pretty hammered -- shakes his head. 
MILLIE "Bull"...something? What is it? 
Charlie and Owen feign ignorance. 
MILLIE (CONT'D) Whatever. It'll come to me. (to Charlie; flirty) So...what do you do now, Crash? 
CHARLIE I write about music. 
MILLIE Really? 
Owen gestures to a WAITRESS to bring THREE MORE SHOTS. 
CHARLIE Yeah...I do freelance for a lot of magazines. But print really is dead. So now most of my stuff winds up on websites. Which is depressing. `Cause you can't hold it -- you can just look at it. It's like... 
Charlie seems lost in drunken thought. Long, awkward silence. Millie puts her hand on Charlie's arm. 
MILLIE Like what? 
CHARLIE Huh? 
MILLIE You were talking about writing for websites and you kinda trailed off, honey. 
OWEN (trying to save the situation) So, Crash -- why don't you tell this nice lady about the 21 days you were up in "The Show," and what the crowds were like, and -- 
CHARLIE It was crazy. I... 
KATE No. 
Charlie seems relieved. 
CHARLIE Me either. Owen keeps trying to get me to be his "wing-man" and it's ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and I just keep thinking how I wish I was meeting you in a bar for the first time and I didn't come with any baggage and I could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number. (beat) Wanna go out sometime? 
KATE I don't think it's a good idea. 
Charlie nods. Long beat. 
CHARLIE I fucked up, didn't I? 
Kate looks down, doesn't speak. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a beautiful woman who used to love me and now when I see her she doesn't even want to look me in the eyes. 
KATE Charlie, please don't do this. 
CHARLIE I miss you. I miss the way you taste and smell and...I miss things about you that used to drive me nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's music and fake punk-rock from the 90's... 
KATE I don't like shitty 80's music. (beat) I like good 80's music. 
CHARLIE ...and all I want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real. 
Silence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a slight smile. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) (changing course) Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional fucking idiot. 
76   INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY      76   * 
Kate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, but a number of items are missing, and it's messier. In general, the room looks more "dude." 
KATE You look really thin. 
CHARLIE Yeah? 
KATE When did you last eat? 
CHARLIE I dunno -- like...I'm not sure. (seems slightly concerned                           * that he can't remember) I think, um... 
KATE Should we order something? 
CHARLIE Sure, yeah -- or I could make a bacon and egg sandwich... 
KATE I don't know. I haven't really been doing the meat thing. 
CHARLIE Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then meat. (beat) Have you given up fun, too? 
Kate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if she finds him funny. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) (off Kate) Sorry. Bad joke. 
Kate cracks a smile. 
KATE Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But I'm gonna make them. 
Charlie raises his eyebrows. 
CHARLIE Okay... 
LATER 
Kate's at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs. 
Charlie goes to the FRIDGE and gets a BOTTLE OF BEER. 
Kate glances at him. 
CHARLIE (CONT'D) Sorry. 
Charlie puts the beer back in the fridge. 
KATE I don't care if you drink a beer. 
CHARLIE You sure?

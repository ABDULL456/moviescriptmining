BARTENDER Well, well ... 
Corky sits as the fat bartender waddles over. 
BARTENDER Been awhile, Cork. 
CORKY Five years, two months, sixteen days. How you doing, Sue? 
Corky puts a cigarette in her mouth and lights it. 
SUE Like shit.  Now that we're all caught up, how about a drink? 
Sue opens the refrigerator and pulls out two Old Styles. 
CORKY Thanks. 
They click the bottles together and drink. 
SUE You got a job yet? 
CORKY Yeah.  Some plumbing, painting and shit. 
Sue laughs. 
SUE I mean a J-O-B.  A real job. 
CORKY Not for me, Sue.  I'm straight and narrow.  I'm just here to get laid or drunk and hopefully both. 
Corky gets off the stool. 
CORKY Thanks for the beer. 
Looking around, she sees a woman alone at one of the back tables.  Through the smoky din, she bears a slight resemblance to Violet. 
The woman is dressed all in black, including a leather jacket. 
Smiling, Corky slides into the chair beside her.  There is no one smoother. 
CORKY Hi. 
WOMAN Hello. 
CORKY You know ...  that outfit would look great on my bedroom floor. 
The woman smiles just as someone taps Corky on the shoulder. 
She turns and is face-to-face with a large bull of a woman in a heavy leather Chicago Police jacket.  She is more wide than fat. 
WOMAN COP Hey, Jesse.  What's happening here? 
CORKY Nothing ...  yet. 
WOMAN COP Who's this? 
Her coat opens as she puts her hands on her hips.  A service revolver is clipped to her belt. 
She squints at Corky, her head nodding in recognition. 
WOMAN COP Wait, I know you. 
CORKY I don't think so. 
WOMAN COP I didn't know you were out. 
Corky smiles at the woman in black. 
CORKY When you get tired of Cagney and Lacey, come find me. 
She heads for the exit. 
EXT.  CITY STREET - NIGHT 
The neighborhood would be politely described as "rough." Corky's truck does not stand out parked alone on the littered street. 
INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
It is a hole but it is home. 
Corky is lying on her futon staring up at the ceiling, a beer resting on her stomach; a folk singer quietly croons from the radio. 
We see the ceiling, a circle of light hovering over the small desk lamp.  We move in on the spot, which slowly fills up the screen until there is nothing but the white light. 
Suddenly a wet paint roller loaded with white paint cuts a swath across the ceiling. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY 
Corky is painting the ceiling.  The folk ballad has become an angry Riot Grrrl anthem. 
She is working hard, the roller sucking back and forth. Sweat covers her face. 
Dropping the roller down, she reloads it in the tray when the phone rings.  She stops and answers it. 
CORKY Hello?  Oh, hi, Mr. Bianchinni ... yes, everything is going fine.  I got the tub drain all cleaned out. 
VIOLET You seem uncomfortable.  Do I make you nervous, Corky? 
CORKY No. 
She looks at Violet, then takes another long pull on the bottle. 
VIOLET Thirsty, maybe. 
Violet smiles, her eyes again talking for her. 
CORKY Curious, maybe. 
VIOLET Curious?  That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now. 
Violet notices the tattoo on Corky's arm. 
VIOLET That's a great tattoo. 
She reaches over and touches it. 
VIOLET Beautiful labrys. 
Corky is a bit suprised that she knows what it is.  She nods, rubbing it as if trying to hide it. 
VIOLET Are you surprised that I know what it is? 
CORKY Maybe. 
VIOLET I have a tattoo, would you like to see it? 
She moves closer, sliding over the leather cushions as she opens the front of her dress. 
VIOLET A woman in upstate New York did it for me. 
She is not wearing a bra. 
VIOLET Here.  Do you like it? 
Set against the soft white skin of her breast is a bright green-stemmed violet. 
VIOLET It took her all day to do it.  She promised me it wouldn't hurt, but it was sore for a long time after.  I couldn't even touch it. 
Corky looks up from Violet's breast to her dark eyes. 
VIOLET But now I love the way it feels. 
She runs her fingers softly over the slightly scarred skin. 
VIOLET Here, touch it. 
Corky feels the blood pounding in her ears as Violet takes her hand and places it on her breast. 
CORKY What are you doing? 
Violet looks at her. 
VIOLET Isn't it obvious?  I'm trying to seduce you. 
CORKY Why? 
VIOLET Because I want to.  I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator. 
Corky watches her, trying to figure her out even as her thumb presses into Violet's nipple. 
Inhaling sharply, Violet closes her eyes; she can feel Corky staring at her. 
VIOLET You don't believe me.  But I can prove it to you. 
She takes Corky's wrist and begins pulling her hand down her body. 
VIOLET You can't believe me because of what you see ... 
She forces Corky's hand between her legs, up under her dress. 
VIOLET But you can believe what you feel. 
Violet opens her eyes, a wanton smile on her lips. 
VIOLET You see ...  I've been thinking about you all day. 
Corky's forearm flexes and Violet moans. 
With both hands, Violet takes hold of Corky's forearm. 
CORKY You planned this whole thing? 
Violet's head swims; she is unable to breathe. 
CORKY You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you? 
VIOLET If I say yes, will you take your hand away? 
CORKY No. 
VIOLET ...  yes. 
VIOLET (V.O.) What do you want, Shelly? 
Shelly glances over his shoulder at Corky, answering in a hushed voice. 
SHELLY 
I have to leave.  Tonight. 
For a moment the intercom is silent.  Then the door buzzes and Shelly pushes inside.  Corky follows him to the elevator. 
INT.  ELEVATOR - DAY 
Corky glares at Shelly and begins pumping the trigger of her circular saw. 
Shelly hides behind his sunglasses, watching the elevator numbers go up.  The doors open and he scurries out. 
INT.  HALL - DAY 
She watches him enter Caesar's apartment, her smile now completely gone. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - DAY 
It is later.  Through the wall we listen to the same sound as before of two people making love.  We drop down and find Corky's brush, still wet with paint, abandoned in her tray. 
INT.  BEDROOM - DAY 
Her face glistening with sweat, Violet climaxes, letting the orgasm spread through her like melting butter. 
VIOLET I had this image of you, inside of me ... 
She flattens her palms against the soft cradle of her pelvis. 
VIOLET Like a part of me ... 
As she opens her eyes, we see that her lover is Corky.  Violet watches as she gets off the bed and begins to get dressed. 
VIOLET You are so beautiful. 
Corky does not answer as she yanks her pants on.  Violet sits up.  She can feel that something is wrong. 
VIOLET What's wrong? 
CORKY Nothing. 
Violet pulls the sheet around her. 
VIOLET Yes there is.  I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee. 
CORKY Shit, here we go. 
VIOLET You didn't want to see me, did you? 
CORKY If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading. 
VIOLET What are you afraid of? 
CORKY I'm not afraid of anything. 
VIOLET I don't understand - ? 
CORKY I know!  You can't understand, because we're different, Violet.  We're different. 
VIOLET We're not that different, Corky. 
CORKY How can you sit in that bed and say that? 
VIOLET Because it's the truth. 
CORKY Let me guess.  This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside.  That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me? 
VIOLET Oh no, she's nothing like you.  She's a lot smarter than you. 
CORKY Is that what her daddy tells her? 
VIOLET I know what I am.  I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder. 
CORKY What are you saying?  That you don't have sex with men? 
VIOLET I don't. 
CORKY For Christ's sake, Violet!  I heard you!  Thin walls, remember? 
VIOLET What you heard wasn't sex. 
CORKY What the fuck was it? 
VIOLET All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex.  Not real sex. But they're wrong.  I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex. 
CORKY What was it then? 
VIOLET Work. 
That knocks Corky back. 
VIOLET You made certain choices in your life that you paid for.  You said you made them because you were good at something and it was easy.  Do you think you're the only one that's good at something? 
JOHNNIE You hear that, bitch?  Be quiet! 
CAESAR Here, put this in his mouth. 
Caesar hands a towel to Johnnie, who stuffs it into Shelly's mouth. 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Like Corky, Violet can hear the beating.  She is trying to block it out but cannot. 
Standing at the bar, she runs the blender, grinding ice cubes, trying to drown out the sounds of the bathroom. 
The bathroom door opens. 
JOHNNIE Prick!  I can go all night!  All night! 
Caesar steps out, shutting the door, masking the sounds behind him.  Violet moves toward him. 
VIOLET Caesar, I'm leaving. 
CAESAR What?  Oh, come on, I didn't use one of the good towels. 
The door opens again as someone else steps out. 
VIOLET Caesar, I'm serious.  This is too much.  I have to get out of here. 
CAESAR Why?  'Cause you know him? 
She nods. 
CAESAR You women are so fucking sensitive. 
He takes hold of her. 
CAESAR But I don't want you to go.  I like you here.  You know this isn't easy for me, either. 
He embraces her.  Over his shoulder she sees MICKEY MALNANO in the hallway, staring at her. 
He is an older man, hair graying, built like a fireplug. Sinewy mass strains at his Brooks Brothers suit. 
CAESAR Now why don't you go watch some TV or something? 
MICKEY Are you okay, Violet? 
CAESAR Mickey, why is Johnnie here?  You know how I feel about that fucking psycho. 
Mickey continues to stare at Violet, who looks up at him with her big doe eyes. 
MICKEY Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something? 
CAESAR Sure, Mickey.  Sure. 
He goes to the kitchen. 
Mickey moves closer to Violet, lifting her chin the way a father would do to his little girl. 
MICKEY You shouldn't have to see this.  Why don't you get out of here?  Go for a walk. 
VIOLET Caesar wants me to stay. 
MICKEY Don't worry about Caesar.  I'll handle Caesar.  You just get out of here, okay? 
She smiles. 
VIOLET Thanks, Mickey. 
Caesar returns from the kitchen.  He is holding a pair of tin snips.  Mickey takes them. 
MICKEY Thanks, C.  Now let's end this thing. 
Violet watches them return to the bathroom. 
INT.  BATHROOM - DAY 
Mickey takes off his coat and hands it to a large man named LOU.  He slaps Johnnie on the back. 
MICKEY Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay. 
Johnnie hits Shelly once more. 
JOHNNIE Prick. 
Johnnie checks his hair in the mirror, carefully.  Then he begins putting on the rings he had removed for the beating. 
Mickey kneels down next to Shelly's ear and motions to Lou, who lifts Shelly's bound arms. 
MICKEY Shelly, I'm going to ask you ten times.  You understand?  Ten times. 
Mickey grabs Shelly's pinky finger, putting it between the metal blades. 
MICKEY One.  Where is our money? 
Shelly whimpers, red-faced and sobbing.  There is a sick crunch and Shelly howls into his gag as his pinky finger bounces to the floor amid the expensive leather footwear. 
CAESAR Aw ...  Christ. 
Corky's truck sits in a gravel parking lot. 
INT.  CORKY'S TRUCK - DAY 
Through the back window of the truck, Violet and Corky are silhouettes against the street light. 
VIOLET Caesar is going to get the money and bring -- 
CORKY How much money? 
VIOLET Shelly said it was over two million dollars. 
Corky quietly swallows that pill.  It begins to rain. 
VIOLET Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through |Shelly's books to figure out how he did it. 
CORKY Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob. 
Violet nods. 
CORKY These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly.  They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.  You fuck them, you've got to do it right. 
VIOLET That's why I need your help.  You said you were good. 
CORKY I am, but ... 
She knows Violet is challenging her. 
CORKY All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying. 
VIOLET You think I'm lying? 
CORKY I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are.  It would have been easy to set Shelly up.  You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment. 
Violet stares, her face poker-blank. 
CORKY All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me. 
VIOLET Is that what you think? 
CORKY I'm just making a point.  You have no idea what you're asking.  How much trust two people need to do something like this. 
She moves closer to Violet, the sound of the rain beating against the metal cab. 
CORKY For me, stealing is a lot like sex. Two people that want the same thing sit in a room and they talk, they start to plan and it's like flirting, a kind of foreplay, because the more they talk about it, the wetter they get. 
She stops. 
CORKY The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself. 
VIOLET Do you think you know me like that? 
CORKY I think ... 
They are close enough to kiss. 
CORKY We're going to find out. 
Corky pulls back. 
CORKY But first, I want to see this money. 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Violet springs from the couch as the front door crashes open, Caesar charging in.  He is doubled over, clutching something to his stomach. 
He rushes to the kitchen, dumping a bloody bundle into the double sink.  There is blood everywhere, smeared up and down Caesar's front. 
VIOLET Oh my God ... 
Violet takes a step toward him, unsure of what has happened. 
CAESAR Don't worry.  It ain't mine. 
He pulls a bottle of whiskey and a glass from the cupboard. 
VIOLET Caesar, what happened? 
CAESAR It was unbelievable!  Un-fucking- believable! 
He pours himeslf a shot, belting it back. 
CAESAR Goddammit, look at this shirt!  It's ruined! 
He begins unbuttoning the bloody shirt. 
CAESAR It started when Shelly took us to the money.  I tell you, Mickey Malnato knows his shit, he does.  Shelly takes us right there. 
He throws down another shot. 
CAESAR So Shelly's down on his knees and he's pulling out this bag of money from a safe in the floor and I'm staring at it like "holy fuck!" I mean, look at it -- 
He tears open the bloody bag, wet money bricks spilling out. 
CAESAR And all I can think is how the fuck did he do this when - Bang!  Johnnie caps him.  Blood sprays everywhere, all over the money.  We've no idea if this is even all of it. 
VIOLET (V.O.) All night long I listened to that sound. 
INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT 
We drift across Caesar's desk, past bricks of bound bills, as Caesar folds the paper tape around another stack. 
CORKY (V.O.) What sound? 
He hits the counter again and we hear the sound, now very loud as hundreds blur by, fluttering beneath us. 
VIOLET (V.O.) The sound of money. 
The sound rolls into thunder -- 
INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
That seems to shake the apartment. 
CORKY And where is it now? 
VIOLET In his office.  I saw it this morning. 
INT.  OFFICE - DAY 
Violet cautiously enters the office with a cup of coffee. 
Working furiously at the computer, Caesar jumps when he sees her, bloodshot eyes animal-wide. 
He checks his watch as she sets the coffee in front of him. 
VIOLET I need to go to the store. 
He nods automatically, back in his work, as she sees the briefcase filled with perfect rows of hundreds. 
VIOLET (V.O.) It's in a case, on his desk. 
CORKY (V.O.) Does the case lock? 
We see the open top with its silver flip-over locks. 
INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Violet is trying to remember. 
VIOLET Yes. 
CORKY Good. 
Corky begins to pace, ordering the information in her head. 
CORKY All right, now, tell me about Johnnie. 
VIOLET Johnnie? 
CORKY It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other. 
VIOLET Like each other?  They hate each other. 
CORKY Why? 
VIOLET It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father. 
CORKY Who is Gino? 
Violet suddenly feels that she has made a mistake. 
VIOLET Gino Marzzone. 
CORKY Marzzone?  As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family? 
VIOLET That's his brother. 
CORKY ...  shit. 
Corky covers her mouth. 
CORKY Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money? 
VIOLET Yeah. 
CORKY And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone? 
VIOLET Yeah. 
CORKY Sweet Jesus. 
Eyes wide, she paces, pulling at her lip, mumbling. 
Suddenly she freezes as it clicks into place.  She looks at Violet. 
CORKY It's perfect. 
She's pacing again. 
CORKY Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment.  It's a big deal, isn't it?  That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before? 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT 
Corky sits on the floor of the dark apartment.  She has taken off her boots, which are beside her. 
VIOLET (V.O.) Waiting for what? 
Through the wall we can hear the shower. 
CORKY (V.O.) For the shower.  That will be our signal. 
Corky opens a thin box filled with needle-thin lock picks. 
She selects several and slips them into her multi-pierced ears like earrings. 
CORKY (V.O.) When he's done with his shower, you will go to the bar. 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
In slow motion, Caesar drops the shower plunger and water chokes from the faucet. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Behind the bar, Violet pulls out the bottle of Glenlivet. 
CORKY (V.O.) You'll get out the Scotch that Gino drinks. 
Violet steps out from the bar, her eyes on the bedroom, when the bottle slips from her hands. 
We watch it slowly fall -- 
CORKY (V.O.) And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.  -- and shatter against the hardwood floor. 
CORKY (V.O.) An accident. 
VIOLET Shit!  Oh shit! 
Caesar yells from the bathroom. 
CAESAR (V.O.) What happened?! 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Hearing Caesar, Corky gets up, moving quietly toward the door. 
CAESAR (V.O.) V!  What the fuck was it?!  Violet? 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Caesar enters, a towel wrapped around him, hair still dripping. 
CAESAR V, what?  You can't hear me? 
Violet looks terribly upset as she begins to clean up. 
VIOLET Caesar, it slipped ...  I was trying to get ready ... 
Caesar realizing what happened. 
CAESAR Oh, fucking Christ ...  You gotta be kidding me! 
He rushes at her. 
CAESAR Fuck!  Fuck!  How did you ...  Awwww goddammit! 
VIOLET I'm sorry.  It was an accident. 
She stands up. 
VIOLET Don't worry, I'll get some more. 
CAESAR There's no time. 
VIOLET Don't be silly, Caesar.  It'll take five minutes. 
She turns him back toward the bedroom. 
VIOLET I'll clean this up and be back before you're even dressed. 
INT.  HALL - NIGHT 
Violet opens her door, stepping into the hall where Corky is waiting. 
CORKY (V.O.) When you open the door, I'll be there. 
They pass each other in silence, Violet stepping out as Corky slips in. 
VIOLET (V.O.) What if he sees you? 
CORKY (V.O.) He won't. 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Caesar is working intensely on his fingernails.  We glide over a set of gleaming metal manicure tools.  We see his hand as he delicately applies a coat of clear polish to a nail. 
Through the open door, we see Corky moving almost casually across the living room. 
VIOLET You mean they weren't up here? 
CAESAR No!  They're still on their way. 
VIOLET That doesn't make any sense. 
CAESAR Why? 
VIOLET Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs. 
Caesar turns. 
CAESAR What? 
VIOLET I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes. 
CAESAR It couldn't have been. 
VIOLET It was him.  I'm positive. 
CAESAR It's impossible! 
VIOLET Caesar, I know Johnnie.  It was him. I screamed when I saw him.  I couldn't believe I missed them.  I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch.  I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop. 
She watches him, her words caving in around him. 
CAESAR But Gino's plane doesn't get in for another half-hour. 
Violet thinks. 
VIOLET Actually, I didn't see Gino in the car. 
His eyes dart.  His forehead beads with sweat.  He turns toward the office. 
INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Violet is staring at Corky's mouth. 
CORKY If Caesar hates Johnnie like you say, then the second he opens the case he'll know, in his gut, that Johnnie just fucked him.  He'll realize that he has no choice.  He can't touch Gino or Johnnie.  There's only one way out. 
She pauses. 
CORKY He'll have to run. 
VIOLET If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money. 
CORKY You'll be clean and we'll be rich. 
INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT 
Caesar stands over the desk, afraid to open the case. 
INT.  CORKY'S APARTMENT - DAY 
VIOLET Jesus, that's beautiful. 
CORKY Thank you. 
VIOLET If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught? 
CORKY Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart. 
She looks dead at Violet. 
CORKY I had a partner and she fucked me. 
VIOLET I won't. 
CORKY I think we're going to find out. 
INT.  OFFICE - NIGHT 
The key turns and the locks pop.  When Caesar sees the newspaper, the whole world begins to spin. 
VIOLET Caesar? 
His chest collapses onto itself while his hands ball into fists. 
CAESAR No no no no ... 
She moves around the side of the desk and sees the newspaper. 
VIOLET Oh God ... 
He slams the case shut, his head hanging down. 
After a moment he looks at her, like a little boy about to cry. 
CAESAR ...  I've been set up. 
He seems ready to scream but can't say anything. 
VIOLET Johnnie? 
The name is like water hitting hot oil. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
CORKY It's all right, Violet.  It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does. 
VIOLET (V.O.) What if he doesn't run? 
CORKY That means he probably will kill Johnnie. 
VIOLET (V.O.) Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here! 
CORKY Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it.  You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out. 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
VIOLET okay, all right. 
CORKY (V.O.) We're almost there, Violet.  just hang on. 
Violet hears him. 
VIOLET He's coming ... 
She hangs up quickly just as Caesar bursts in. 
CAESAR I got it!  I know what I got to do! I got to get the money. 
VIOLET The money?  The money's gone. 
CAESAR No.  Johnnie's got it.  All I got to do is get it back. 
VIOLET But it could be anywhere. 
CAESAR He didn't have that much time.  He had to pick up Gino.  I bet you he's got it with him.  I bet it's in the car. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Corky presses against the wall, trying to hear. 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Caesar is pacing. 
CAESAR He didn't see you, did he? 
VIOLET No. 
CAESAR See, right now he doesn't know that I know, that's why he put the paper in the case.  He wants me to hand the case to Gino.  Then there is no doubt it was me.  Gino will put a bullet in me himself.  But it ain't going to happen.  I won't let it! Johnnie ain't going to fuck me!  Not like this!  No way! 
VIOLET This is insane! 
She throws open her closet. 
CAESAR What are you doing? 
She grabs a suitcase from under the bed. 
VIOLET I'm leaving!  This is crazy!  I don't want to be involved.  I don't want anything to do with this shit! 
She starts yanking the dresses from the closet. 
CAESAR You can't leave. 
VIOLET The hell I can't! 
CAESAR I need you ... 
VIOLET Bullshit!  You don't need me!  You've never needed me!  I can't help you! Understand?!  I have to get out. 
CAESAR Violet, I won't let you leave. 
She turns and sees that he is holding a gun. 
CAESAR If you're not with me, Violet, then I have to assume you're against me. 
VIOLET Caesar, this is crazy. 
CAESAR Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.  Maybe you dropped the Scotch by accident. Maybe you didn't. 
Now it is her turn to feel the world spin. 
CAESAR It would have been so easy to let him in as you went out. 
VIOLET You don't, you can't believe that 
CAESAR I've seen the way he looks at you. He's always wanted you.  Maybe two million dollars finally bought you. 
She slaps him hard.  He stares at her. 
CAESAR I'm sorry, Violet, but it has to be this way. 
He moves past her, picks up the dresses and returns them to the closet. 
CAESAR I hope you understand.  I want to trust you, I want to believe you, but I don't have any other choice. 
He shuts the closet. 
Each man sits on either side of Gino. 
GINO Caesar, look at me.  Johnnie tell me what happened.  Caesar, you gotta do me a favor, a personal favor.  For me, eh?  You gotta start respecting Johnnie the way you respect me.  You understand?  Good. 
Caesar sees Johnnie smiling at him, but when Gino turns, the smile disappears. 
GINO And you, Johnnie.  You gonna stop acting stupid.  You gotta earn this respect that Caesar's gonna give. You understand?  Good.  Done.  Now, where's my money? 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Corky drops a hefty bag, knotted tight, into an open five- gallon bucket of paint. 
As she picks up a paint stick, we see a second bag beside another bucket. 
She pushes the first bag down until it disappears, enveloped by the milk-white liquid. 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Caesar puts the briefcase onto the coffee table. 
Gino looks up at Caesar, very serious, with his hand on the case. 
GINO We know how this was done, eh? 
CAESAR Yeah, I know. 
He looks dead at Johnnie. 
GINO It won't happen again, eh? 
Caesar shakes his head. 
GINO Good. 
Gino throws down the last of the Scotch. 
GINO Done.  We go now. 
JOHNNIE Jesus Christ, Pop.  You got two hours until your plane leaves. 
Gino checks his watch, shouting in Italian.  Johnnie shouts back until Gino throws up his hands, refusing to listen. 
GINO Caesar! 
He gestures to his empty glass, then folds his arms, leaning back.  Caesar gets the bottle. 
JOHNNIE So Caesar, what did it total out at? 
CAESAR Two point one seventy-six. 
Johnnie whistles as Caesar pours Gino another Scotch. 
JOHNNIE Unbelievable.  Can you believe that, Violet? 
GINO Hey, Johnnie ... 
In Italian tells him to shut up. 
JOHNNIE Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing.  Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it.  I bet it wasn't a big deal.  Was it, Caesar? 
CAESAR What's that, Johnnie? 
JOHNNIE The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ... 
GINO Johnnie, what did I say? 
JOHNNIE Pop, this is important to me.  It's a simple question.  if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it. 
CAESAR Where is this going, Johnnie? 
JOHNNIE Just admit it, Caesar. 
CAESAR Admit what? 
JOHNNIE That you overreacted.  That you lost it.  Not me.  It was your mistake. 
Caesar sees it so clearly now. 
CAESAR All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case. 
VIOLET Caesar ... 
CAESAR Shut up, Violet!  This is between me and Johnnie. 
He pushes the case toward him. 
CAESAR You want to do this now, let's do it.  Open the case.  Open the fucking case. 
Johnnie stares at him, feeling that something is very wrong. 
CAESAR That's right, I know.  I fucking know. 
JOHNNIE Know what? 
CAESAR Open the case! 
CAESAR Sit down, Gino! 
GINO No, Caesar, gimme the gun. 
CAESAR Stay away! 
He backs up as Gino walks straight to him. 
GINO We're family, Caesar. 
CAESAR No! 
GINO Gimme the gun. 
CAESAR I can't.  I can't. 
GINO Give it to me. 
He reaches up and takes bold of the barrel.  Caesar looks resigned as he shuts his eyes. 
GINO Good man. 
Close on Gino's hand holding the gun barrel as -- 
Caesar fires. 
From behind the gun we watch Gino's grip yanked free, time melting away as he falls, blood bubbling from his chest, his eyes wide in disbelief. 
His body hits the floor and the room erupts. 
Roy dives, drawing his gun as Caesar continues to fire, pumping the trigger. 
Violet drops behind the bar as Jobnnie screams, falling towards his father. 
Blood spurts from Roy as two bullets hit, his gun clattering and sliding across the floor. 
Johnnie lunges at Caesar as Caesar turns and fires, hitting Johnnie everywhere; blood and meat spray and speckle everything around him. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The gun continues to fire as Corky clutches the phone, whispering. 
CORKY This is an emergency! 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Crunched down behind the bar, Violet listens to the only sound, repeating in the unnatural quiet: 
Click.  Click. 
Click. 
Rising, she peers over the edge of the bar. 
Caesar is standing in the aftermath.  His gun is still aimed at Johnnie as he pulls the trigger over and over. 
The bodies are still, blood silently pooling around them. 
Blinking the sweat from his eyes, Caesar sees Violet. 
CAESAR I had to do it, Violet.  You saw it. I had no choice.  It was Johnnie. That lying fuck.  He made me do it. 
He looks down at Jobnnie, hate rising like bile. 
CAESAR You lying rat-fuck.  You think you can set me up?  Is that what you think?  You stupid fuck. 
Kicking the body, be causes a series of sickening wet noises. 
CAESAR I'm a dead man?  I'm a dead man? Guess again, fuck-face.  Who's dead? Who's the dead lying rat-fuck?  Take another guess, take another fucking guess! 
He stops, panting, unable to catch his breath.  Violet is afraid to even look at him. 
Blood creeps along the edge of the floorboards. 
Caesar tries to clear his head, mopping the sweat from his face.  He bends down and starts searching Johnnie's pockets. 
He finds his keys. 
VIOLET What are you doing? 
Lost in thought, he goes to Gino.  Throwing open the coat, he sees the airplane ticket.  There is a bullet hole in it. 
He checks the times and then his watch. 
CAESAR ...  maybe three hours. 
VIOLET Caesar, what are you going to do? 
CAESAR What do you think we're going to do? We have to find the money. 
VIOLET What? 
CAESAR Once we have the money, then none of this ever happened. 
VIOLET Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone. 
CAESAR Get me a wet towel. 
His words push her to the bathroom. 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Stuffing a towel into the sink, she turns on the water.  She does not even look at the shower curtain. 
INT.  HALL - NIGHT 
The elevator opens and the cops step out. 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Caesar grabs the television remote, hits "on" and jacks the volume until it is obviously loud. 
Violet returns and he snatches the towel from her. 
INT.  HALL 
As the two cops walk down the hall, they hear the television. They look at each other, already knowing what happened. 
INT.  CAESAR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Like a maniac, Caesar wipes at any blood still visible until there is a knock on the door.  He grabs Violet by the arm. 
CAESAR If you're thinking about doing something stupid, remember I just killed Gino Marzzone.  You understand what that means? 
She nods. 
VIOLET They're just cops. 
There is another knock, much louder. 
Violet goes to the door as Caesar rips off his blood-soaked jacket and shirt. 
He drops down behind the bar Leaving the chain on, Violet opens the door.  Tbe cops smile. 
COP #1 See?  We're for real. 
VIOLET I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories. 
COP #1 You did the right thing. 
Crouching, Caesar wipes vigorously at the blood on his hands and face. 
Violet opens the door. 
Caesar crams the bloody wad under the bar sink. 
Just as the cops enter the living room, Caesar stands, looking comfortable in no shirt, with ice cubes in his hands. 
CAESAR Hey, hey, Chicago's finest. 
He plunks the ice into a glass and walks from behind the bar 
CAESAR How's it going tonight, fellas? 
COP #1 Pretty good, sir. 
Caesar turns his head. 
CAESAR Huh?  I'm sorry, I can only hear in this ear. 
Tbe cops look at each other again. 
Wiping his wet hand on his pants, Caesar shakes hands with each of them. 
CAESAR I'm Caesar and this here is my Violet. 
They smile at Violet as Caesar puts his arm around her. 
CAESAR Violet said something about gunshots? 
Violet sees the gun wedged in the back of his belt. 
COP #2 Yes, sir, a neighbor in the building called in. 
COP #1 I think we know what happened. 
COP #2 It was probably just the television. 
CAESAR The television? 
He looks at Violet. 
CAESAR Honey, why didn't you say something? Turn it off. 
Violet walks across the rug and turns off the TV. 
CAESAR Fuck, this happened before.  It's this shitty ear.  Born with it.  The batteries wore out in my aid.  I'm sorry. 
COP #1 It's all right, sir. 
COP #2 No big deal. 
From the main doors, Corky slips out of the building.  Hiding behind a column, she sees Violet and Caesar across the lot. 
Corky moves behind the parked cars, the gun squeezed in her hand. 
Violet edges away, on the verge of running, looking toward the busy street. 
Standing, Caesar pounds on the car. 
CAESAR Fuck!  Fuck!  Fuck! 
VIOLET Caesar, someone could see us out here. 
Ignoring her, be tries to think. 
CAESAR Get in. 
Still too far from them to do anytbing, Corky sees Caesar slam the trunk. 
CAESAR Get in!  It's got to be at his house. That's the only other place it could be. 
Violet looks around the lot, looking for some way out. 
CAESAR Violet!  Now! 
Corky can only watch as Violet gets in and the car rips away. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Alone, Corky stands over the bucket of paint.  She kicks it with her boot-toe. 
CORKY Two million dollars, Cork ...  Two million dollars ... 
She sighs, wondering how long she can make herself wait. 
EXT.  JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
The BMW is parked in front. 
INT.JOHNNIE'S BROWNSTONE - NIGHT 
Close on Caesar, as he rakes his sweaty hair back, his face knotted in torment. 
CAESAR Okay, I come in ... 
He turns as if he just came in through the front door. 
We see Johnnie's home has been laid to waste.  The furniture is broken, cushions split open, pictures shattered, holes punched in the drywall -- even the carpeting has been torn up. 
Caesar doesn't look much better. 
CAESAR I've got the money ... 
Huddled in a corner, Violet watches him. 
CAESAR I can't wait to see the look on Caesar's face when he finds out. 
Caesar moves from the front door, trying to get into Johnnie's head. 
CAESAR Now I don't have much time ... 
He takes a couple of steps into the room. 
CAESAR Got to put it someplace safe ... 
He looks at a closet.  It's gutted, searched 10 times already. 
CAESAR ...  put it ... 
A couple more uneasy steps and he looks at a large over-turned rolltop desk. 
CAESAR ...  got it ... 
He starts looking around the room as if he is seeing for the first time that it is destroyed.  He is near the breaking point. 
VIOLET C? 
His voice cracks.  There is nowhere else to look. 
CAESAR Where did I put it? 
He explodes.  A terra cotta lamp sails across the room. 
CAESAR Where's my fucking money?!  Fucking cocksuckers!  Where the fuck is it?! 
He smashes his forehead into the wall, denting the drywall. 
CAESAR Ow. 
He holds his head, sinking to the ground. 
VIOLET C? 
She sits next to him, putting a hand lightly on his shoulder. 
VIOLET It's not here, Caesar. 
VIOLET (V.O.) just a little longer and it's ours. 
INT.  KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Mumbling to himself, Caesar walks out of the kitchen, heading for the bedroom. 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Violet reaches out and touches the wall, as if she were touching Corky. 
VIOLET Corky, I have to tell you something 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Corky turns to the wall. 
CORKY I know, Violet.  I know. 
Her fingers gently touch the wall as we travel up and over, where we see they are actually touching the wall in the exact same place. 
CORKY It's why I'm still here. 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Suddenly, Violet hears Caesar. 
CAESAR (V.O.) Violet? 
As he opens the door, she slams down the phone. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The line cuts off. 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Fear and panic paralyze Violet as Caesar drops everything, grabbing for his gun. 
CAESAR Who was that? 
He levels the gun at her. 
CAESAR Who the fuck was that? 
She stands and be rushes at her, grabbing her by the throat. 
CAESAR Was that Mickey?  Did you call Mickey? Did you?! 
She shakes her head and he throws her on the bed.  The gun aimed at her, he picks up the phone and -- 
Hits the redial. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Unsure of what happened, Corky hears the phone ring and answers it on reflex. 
Listening, she waits. 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Caesar listens, waiting as long as he can. 
CAESAR Mickey?  Is that you? 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Corky hangs up, jumping away from the wall. 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Caesar hits the redial again. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Panicking, Corkydoesn't answer it, but as it rings very loud in the empty apartment, she realizes her mistake. 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Turning slowly toward the wall, Caesar hears the phone ringing in the empty apartment. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Corky rips the plug out of the wall. 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The line goes dead. 
CAESAR Who is that?  Who is over there?! Tell me! 
She tries to get away, but he grabs her and slaps her to the ground. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT 
Corky hears Violet scream and that does it.  Gun in hand, she flies at the door. 
CAESAR Shut up, Violet! 
VIOLET He can't kill you -- 
He aims the gun at Violet. 
CAESAR Violet! 
VIOLET Not until he has the money! 
He fires and she jumps as the bullet punches through the wall behind her. 
His point made, he puts the gun back to Corky's head. 
CAESAR Now, where the fuck is my money? 
CORKY Lick me. 
CAESAR Where is it? 
CORKY Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face. 
Blood temperature rising again, Caesar pulls the gun back and slaps her with it. 
CAESAR Stupid cunt! 
VIOLET Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think -- 
CAESAR Don't try to tell me what to do. 
VIOLET You need the money just like we do. 
CAESAR Shut up, Violet. 
VIOLET Let us go and we'll make a deal. 
He rushes at her, grabbing a fistful of her hair. 
CAESAR Shut the fuck up! 
He looks at Corky. 
CAESAR What did you do to her?!  This isn't my Violet! 
He looks at her as if unable to recognize her 
CAESAR What did she do to you? 
VIOLET Everything you couldn't. 
He shoves her down. 
CAESAR You ungrateful bitch!  You had nothing before I met you.  You were nothing! 
He stomps around the room. 
CAESAR Who gave you this place?  This apartment? 
He throws open the closet. 
CAESAR Who gave us all of this?  I did!  I gave you everything!  I gave you this life!  I made you, Violet.  I saved you. 
He seems to believe what he is saying. 
CAESAR I saved you. 
VIOLET Ha!  What a load of crap.  Look at yourself, Caesar.  You're a thug. |You launder money for the mob.  You rent women like you rented this apartment. 
He doesn't want to hear this. 
VIOLET Saved me?  You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you.  All part of the business. 
CAESAR You betrayed me! 
VIOLET You murdered Gino! 
CAESAR I had to.  You made me. 
VIOLET Bullshit, you killed him.  Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you. 
CAESAR Shut up! 
He slaps her. 
CAESAR Okay, you want business, I'll give you the fucking business. 
He leans closer. 
CAESAR I'm going to make you beg just like Shelly did.  Just like Shelly! 
He storms out of the room. 
Corky looks up at Violet. 
VIOLET I'm sorry, Corky ... 
CESAR (V.O.) Hello? 
VIOLET Hello, Caesar.  This is Gino. 
Caesar looks toward the bathroom. 
CAESAR (V.O.) What? 
VIOLET You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Caesar's eyes light up. 
CAESAR Holy shit, I don't believe it!  We've been going crazy over here, Gino! 
VIOLET (V.O.) Good boy. 
Mickey jumps up. 
CAESAR It's Gino!  It's Gino! 
MICKEY Where in the hell is he? 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
VIOLET We were in a car accident -- 
CAESAR (V.O.) They were in a car accident. 
VIOLET But everybody is all right. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
CAESAR They're all fine.  Just bruises and shit. 
VIOLET (V.O.) Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ... 
MICKEY Un-fucking-believable.  I called those highway patrol dumb fucks. 
CAESAR Ssh!  I can't hear Gino! 
VIOLET (V.O.) We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey. 
CAESAR I'm listening. 
INT.  BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Violet has her robe over her dress, wrapping her hair in a towel, making sure the bruise on her forehead is hidden. 
VIOLET I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies.  No one.  Say yes, I understand. 
CAESAR (V.O.) Yes, I understand. 
VIOLET Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out. 
CAESAR (V.O.) Sure, Gino, sure. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Out of the corner of his eye, he watches Violet come out of the bathroom. 
CAESAR St.  Mary's off the Kennedy, sure. Okay, Gino. 
Mickey sees Violet. 
VIOLET Mickey?  What are you doing here? 
MICKEY Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.  They were in a car accident. 
VIOLET Oh my God.  Was anyone hurt? 
MICKEY I think everything is okay. 
Caesar hangs up. 
CAESAR They're at St.  Mary's in the waiting room. 
Mick is already on the way. 
MICKEY I can't fit them all in my car so give me your keys.  You drive my car, Lou. 
Caesar sees Violet walking toward the kitchen. 
CAESAR Sure, Mickey, sure.  Violet! 
She stops, looking straight at the freezer. 
CAESAR Go grab my car keys from my pants in the bathroom. 
She turns to him. 
CAESAR Please, help us out, Mickey wants to get going. 
She turns to the bathroom. 
CAESAR Violet! 
He aims the gun as she hurls her self into the emergency door. 
CAESAR Fuck! 
INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
She flies, hands on the rail, spiraling down each flight as he charges after her. 
CAESAR Goddammit, Violet!  Stop!  Now! 
INT.  BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Straining, Corky's fingers curl around the handle of the clippers. 
INT.  LOBBY - NIGHT 
Violet smashes through the door, but instead of turning to the main doors, she runs straight for the elevators. 
She pounds the button and waits. 
VIOLET Come on.  Come on, please. 
She hears Caesar coming just as the elevator opens. 
Caesar crashes out of the stair door, running toward the exit.  When he doesn't see Violet, he turns to the sound of the elevator -- 
And catches a glimpse of her as the doors close. 
CAESAR Oh, you bitch.  You fucking bitch. 
Taking a really deep breath, he throws open the door to the stairs. 
INT.  ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
Violet takes Johnnie's cellular phone from the robe pocket and dials a number. 
Mickey answers on the car phone. 
VIOLET Mickey!  Oh God, Mickey! 
MICKEY (V.O.) Violet? 
Whispering, she acts terrified. 
VIOLET He made me help him, Mickey, God, I was so afraid.  It was Caesar, all Caesar.  You have to help me.  He's coming - Oh God! 
She hangs up, eyes blazing. 
INT.  STAIRWELL - NIGHT 
Sweat pouring off him, Caesar climbs the stairs. 
INT.  HALL - NIGHT 
The elevator opens, Violet bolts out.  She runs down the hall, past the empty apartment, back to her door. 
VIOLET Corky? 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT - NIGHT 
She rushes to the bedroom, where she finds the coils of cut rope. 
VIOLET Corky! 
She looks at the wall separating the apartment. 
INT.  HALL - NIGHT 
Caesar half-falls out of the stair door, drenched with sweat. 
INT.  EMPTY APARTMENT 
Gun ready, Caesar throws open the door. 
Spread out like a pond of milk is the spilled paint, but -- 
The money is gone. 
Leading away from the white pool are boot prints and the drip trail of the plastic bag. 
The tracks lead to the bathroom. 
Caesar kicks open the bathroom door and finds the bag of money next to Corky's empty boots. 
Over his shoulder we see Corky already swinging a massive pipe wrench. 
At the last second he is able to duck, falling to the ground as -- 
The doorjamb splinters with a terrible metal crunch. 
Before he can recover and shoot, she brings the wrench down on his arm. 
He screams as the gun hits the floor.

EXT. CHEESEBRIDGE ALLEY - NIGHT 
Lightning strikes, illuminating a vine covered wall as the camera moves across a dark alley filled with CARDBOARD BOXES and CRATES. They boxes have stylized LABELS; the box in front is labeled FOCUS FEATURES. 
SFX: FOOTSTEPS running on cobblestones and LABORED BREATHING. 
HERBERT (O.S.) No. Not my boy! 
Lightning strikes again, highlighting the boxes and rubbish in the alley. Something is coming. Whatever it is, its breath is hurried and animalistic. 
SFX: A BABY CRIES out. 
Stumpy CLAWED FEET wrapped in rag run past a boxed labeled LAIKA. The camera follows the shadowed figure as it runs along cobblestones to the end of the lane. The creature pauses under an arched entryway and turns, revealing GLOWING EYES, a large mouth full of wonky teeth, and a BABY SHAPED BUNDLE in its arms. 
LIGHTING CRASHES as the BABY wriggles and cries. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHEESE GUILD - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
CLOSE ON: A FIST pounds a door. 
SNATCHER (WHEEZING) Wake his lordship. 
SFX: A SERIES OF LOCKS being unlatched on the door. 
A BUTLER opens the double doors, frowns. He starts to close the doors but Snatcher pushes against the effort. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) The unspeakable has happened. (GASP) We must speak of it immediately! 
A voice calls out from behind them. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (O.S.) (TIRED) What is it, Snatcher? 
The butler moves aside, revealing a regal man with a white hat at the top of an ornate marble staircase. 
INT. CHEESE GUILD - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND looks on from the mezzanine. The man in the red hat casts a long shadow across the gleaming checkered floors of the Cheese Guild. 
SNATCHER (GESTURING THEATRICALLY) Boxtroll monsters have stolen a child. 
CLOSE ON: Lord Portley-Rind, perfectly groomed and perfectly horrified. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (AGHAST) No. 
CLOSE ON: ARCHIBALD SNATCHER in the door, backlit by streetlights, sheets of rain falling behind him. He's a big man, but out of shape (all belly and no butt), with long shreds of greasy hair sprouting from beneath his crooked hat. 
SNATCHER (NODS) They're no doubt picking their teeth with his adorable baby bones by now! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND A horrible tragedy. (beat, flippant) Let's deal with it in the morning! 
Portley-Rind turns to go. 
SNATCHER (O.S.) STOP! 
The Butler closes the door, but Snatcher shoves his foot in the way. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) (STRUGGLING) Oh, oof! That's not the worst of it! Next they'll come after... 
The Butler shoves at the door, slapping and shoving Snatcher's face until the door slams shut. Snatcher opens the mail slot and yells through it. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) ...OUR CHEESES! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (GASP) My Gouda!? 
SNATCHER (LOW) They'll stop at nothing. 
Portley-Rind suddenly flings open the doors, stares wide eyed at Snatcher. He is crouched on the ground near the mail slot. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND You're the town exterminator. I'll pay whatever it takes. 
Snatcher stands slowly. 
SNATCHER Oh, I don't want money. 
He steps into the house and into the light, REVEALING his greedy face for the first time. He smiles an oily smile. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) I want one of those. 
Snatcher points to the WHITE HAT on Portley-Rind's head. Lord Portley-Rind grabs his hat protectively. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND A White Hat? You?! Absurd! 
Snatcher turns to leave, moving towards the damp Market Square. 
SNATCHER Alright then. But prepare to say bye bye to your Brie. Cheerio to your Cheddar. Goodbye to your... 
FISH (CONT'D) (GURGLES) Oh yeah... 
Fish's eyes go wide as the clock's alarm RINGS, attracting the attention of an uglier, 2-foot-2 boxtroll. 
SHOE Huh? 
As Fish stands proudly admiring the sound of his ringing alarm clock, SHOE bounces around his feet. 
SHOE (CONT'D) (GURGLES) Gimme that! 
Shoe, short and feisty, grabs the alarm clock from Fish and scampers away with it. Fish watches as Shoe climbs a stack of crates and hisses back at him, sniffing at his new prize. Fish scowls at Shoe and returns to the rubbish pile, shaking his head and muttering. 
Behind him a half-dozen boxtrolls methodically pick through an assortment of trash barrels and old boxes. It's like a troop of monkeys at the dump. They find mechanical stuff, inspect it, and then either drop it into their box to keep or toss it back into the trash. 
A filthy TEDDY BEAR WITH A MUSICAL KEY is discarded by another boxtroll, landing with a THUNK and A FEW TINNY MUSICAL NOTES. Fish turns excitedly. 
FISH (CURIOUS) Ohhhh... 
He picks up the teddy bear and cranks a key in its back as Shoe toys with the stolen alarm clock. The teddy bear plays MUSIC. Fish gurgles along to the tune and bobs his head, enjoying the moment. 
Again, Shoe notices Fish has found something interesting. He shoves the alarm clock into his box, stealthily sneaks up on Fish and makes a grab for the teddy bear! Fish refuses to let go and they squabble over it. Suddenly all the boxtrolls snap to attention, their ears alert-- 
EXT. CHASE ALLEY 
The creepy RATTLING SOUNDS of the Redhats' truck returns. 
All the boxtrolls hide in their boxes. The "camouflage" works. Their boxes fit in perfectly with the trash barrels and packing crates. 
The rattling comes closer... closer... then STOPS. 
BAM! HEADLIGHTS light up the alley. 
Three men dismount from the truck and cast long shadows across the alley and all of the boxes: the giant MR. TROUT, the beanpole thin MR. PICKLES, and the short, pit bull MR. GRISTLE. 
The boxtrolls don't run -- they just KEEP HIDING IN THEIR BOXES. 
SNATCHER (O.S.) GENTLEMEN! 
Snatcher spreads his arms theatrically and wades into the garbage-strewn alley. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) Look at all these boxes left lying about. How curious, how peculiar. I do believe... evil is afoot. 
Gristle chuckles and breaks into a psychotic grin. 
MR. GRISTLE (COLD BLOODED) HAHAHA. FOOT. 
MR. PICKLES Huh. 
Fish peeks out of his box momentarily, then retreats when he sees the Redhats advancing into the alley. 
Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles absentmindedly check boxes for boxtrolls, but Mr. Gristle methodically stomps and smashes every box he can. When he finds a box with a boxtroll, he uses a CRICKET BAT to WHACK it back to the others to load onto the truck. 
MR. PICKLES (CONT'D) You ever seen someone's foot be evil, Mr. Trout? 
MR. TROUT I believe the boss meant evil is nearby, Mr. Pickles. 
MR. PICKLES My foot had a pretty nasty bunion once. I wouldn't say the foot itself was evil. 
MR. TROUT No, it's just a fancy-man's word for vicinity. 
MR. PICKLES Wrinkly ol' bunion looked like my grandmum. Had to saw her off. The bunion, not my grandmum. 
Mr. Gristle spots a shivering box and positions himself over it, cricket bat in hand. 
MR. GRISTLE Ah, yes.   FOOT! 
WHACK! Gristle kicks the box, and it flies toward Mr. Pickles and Mr. Trout. 
MR. TROUT There's one! 
Mr. Pickles scoops it up in a dog catcher's net. 
MR. PICKLES Come on, ya squirmy monster. Your days of evil-doin' are over. 
Mr. Gristle finds another shivering box. He swings his bat. 
MR. GRISTLE BOOM! 
WHACK! A box slides over to Trout. A dizzy boxtroll pops out for a moment, groaning. Trout taps its head and the boxtroll retreats. 
MR. TROUT You really think these boxtrolls understand the duality of good and evil? 
MR. PICKLES They must, right? Why else would they hide from us. We are the good guys. 
Mr. Pickles strolls off with both boxtroll and net. 
MR. GRISTLE (O.S.) (hitting more boxes) Nice! NICE! 
WHACK! Another box slides over to Trout. Trout scoops up the box before the creature can get away. The boxtroll's legs dangle below as it is carried away. 
MR. TROUT Yeah... I suppose we are. 
CLOSE ON: Fish and Shoe, in the shadows at the edge of the alley, gurgle to each other while the Red Hats are distracted. Their heads stay hidden in their boxes as they waddle slowly out of the alley. 
Mr. Gristle is too preoccupied with smashing other boxes to notice them. He grunts and laughs with the effort. 
Snatcher spots Fish and Shoe as they exit the alley and points at them. 
SNATCHER MR. GRISTLE! 
FISH (GURGLED) Eggs? 
EGGS (low, feral growls) 
Out of the shadows waddles the small boxtroll. The first thing that comes into the light is his box with an EGGS LOGO printed on the front, then appears the dirty face of a feral- looking 2-YEAR-OLD HUMAN BOY, EGGS. 
Fish flashes a wonky-toothed smile at Eggs. 
EGGS (CONT'D) Fish! 
Fish plays a game of hide and seek with the found teddy bear. He makes the arm, then another arm, then the head appear from the arm and head holes of his box. Baby Eggs is enthralled. He excitedly launches himself at Fish. They play wrestle over the toy until Eggs grabs it from Fish and scampers away. 
Eggs hugs the bear. So cute. Then... RIPS ITS HEAD OFF! 
He reaches into the teddy bear's chest cavity and pulls out the MUSIC BOX. He tosses the gutted bear body away and tries to get it to work. When he can't figure it out he holds it up to Fish. 
EGGS (CONT'D) Fish? 
Fish winds the music box, gurgling an explanation of how it works. Music fills the dark nook. 
Eggs giggles with delight as the gears work again.    They both close their eyes and hum along to the music. 
EGGS (CONT'D) (HUMS TUNE) Do do doo do doo... 
EGGS (CONT'D) (hums along with music) 
They stop humming when the giant clock chimes signaling the end of the boxtroll "day". 
CUT TO: 
(0400 GRU) GROWING UP BOXTROLL 
INT. BOXTROLL CAVERN - CLOCK 
CLOSE ON: the clock as the large hands representing the moon and the sun flip. 
INT. BOXTROLL CAVERN - SLEEPING PILE 
As the lights go out, Knickers and the other boxtrolls gather at the center of the cavern to sleep in a big, communal stack of boxes like one big family. 
The sleeping pile is stacked tight and high. Fish and Eggs climb to the top of the pile. Fish holds Eggs up so he can pull a chain to turn out the last light in the cavern. 
Baby Eggs lies   looking straight up. The ceiling of the cavern is dotted with   lots of small lights and slowly turning machines -- it   looks like the flickering of stars. Baby Eggs happily drifts   off to sleep, snuggling the head he ripped from the teddy   bear. 
EXT. CHEESEBRIDGE ALLEY - NIGHT 
The boxtroll clock chimes, signaling it is night above ground and time to wake up! Eggs swings from the light bulb and YELLS! 
EGGS Wake up! 
The box pile explodes and falls apart as all the boxtrolls are startled awake. 
- EGGS NOOK: Fish winds up the teddy bear's MUSIC BOX and adds it to a MUSIC MACHINE, built out of assorted junk and driven by the teddy bear's music box. 
Eggs pounds a hammer on a typewriter at the bottom of the machine and Fish pulls out a saw and draws a bow across it. Together they play a croaking music-mechanique song. 
- Eggs rides on WHEELS' shoulders. Wheels makes gurgling sounds like he is revving his engines. They ride around the base of the CONVEYOR BELT, watching boxtrolls roll down from the CHUTES. 
Wheels swerves to avoid boxtrolls as they tumble off of the conveyor belt, holding Eggs out to Fish as he rolls into view. Fish catches Eggs and runs with him held like a football. 
- Fish in the cavern nook. He pulls out a prize bit of junk - a 78 rpm album by the QUATTRO SABATINO. Eggs' eyes go wide. 
EGGS OOOH! Hee hee hee. 
Fish puts the record on the player and lowers the needle. Baby Eggs holds on to the record player, shaking his bottom to the beat and dancing, while Fish plays a MUSICAL SAW with his BOW. Eggs dances and turns to Fish, beating his box approvingly. 
- CLOSE ON: A roiling pile of BUGS as boxtroll hands, and one baby human's hand, reach in and grab fists full of bugs. 
Boxtrolls munch up mouthfuls of bugs and Eggs chomps away with them, just another monster. 
- Eggs and Fish play music in the nook, their music machine is evolving. First Eggs shakes the jar of buttons, then he strikes a beat on a cowbell. 
- Eggs is chasing Oil Can. He trips on his box and falls flat on his face, popping out of his box by mistake. Oil Can sees Eggs empty box and FREAKS! 
OIL CAN AAAAHHH! 
Oil Can's wailing gets all the boxtrolls in the cavern to turn, see the empty box and SCREAM! It's a collective communal melt down - Fish runs up to Eggs in a panic, crams his box back on and GURGLES the rule- 
FISH (GURGLED) BOXTROLLS NEVER TAKE OFF THEIR BOXES! 
- Baby Eggs and Fish continue to play their music in the nook. Eggs hit the cowbell expertly with a spoon and dances, smiling and laughing. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
- 11 YEAR OLD EGGS laughing absolutely rocking out to the music machine with the Quattro Sabatino song mixed in. Eggs plays the WASHBOARD while Fish plays his saw. The jar of buttons and the cowbell have been added to the music machine. 
- Close on several PILL BUGS crawling on the cavern floor. Shoe pokes them and they curl into a ball. He gathers them up and growls happily from behind a pile of junk, eyeing Eggs. 
Eggs hides behind a little barrier of corrugated metal with his own pile of pill bug balls. Shoe hurls a bug at Eggs and misses, hitting the metal. 
EGGS Ha! Missed me! 
Eggs tosses a bug at Shoe, and Shoe smugly laughs as the bug flies into a tube. While he laughs, the bug shoots out from the tube, smacking him on his nose. OOF! 
- Eggs and Fish are grooving along to their music machine. Eggs transitions from the washboard to smashing light bulbs with a SKILLET. 
Outside of the nook, other boxtrolls bob their heads happily along with the music. 
- CLOSE ON: Eggs as he slides on a "new" HELMET made out of junk. It is fitted with lights so he can see in the dark. 
BRODERICK I'm tasting notes of... plum! 
Boulanger snores. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (mouth full, reading DOCKET) All good fun, but we do have this school funding initiative to vote on. Been sitting here for months. All in favor of-- 
BRODERICK --Cutting open the Roquefort next? 
ALL AYE!! 
Lord Portley-Rind tosses the docket behind him, giving in. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND Well, okay, okay. A quick reminder, tomorrow is Trubshaw Baby Remembrance Day. (PERVY) And we all know what that means... a performance by Madame Frou Frou. 
A burst of STEAM shoots out of Boulanger's wheelchair. 
BOULANGER A VISION! 
BRODERICK Now there's a woman... 
LANGSDALE ... With some cheese on her bones! 
Portley-Rind leans in like he has a secret, and slowly caresses a piece of brie as he says: 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND A lady like that is like a fine brie. Raw. Dangerous. (DEEP SNIFF) Maybe a little stinky, but one taste and you'll be begging for... mmm . . . 
Lord Portley-Rind nuzzles the brie and kisses its crust. 
WINNIE (O.S.) Father! 
Suddenly, he looks up he sees: 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND WINIFRED! 
He SQUEEZES the cheese in his hand, which EXPLODES all over. A hunk of the brie lands on his hat. He jumps up and storms over to the door. The White hats murmur and gasp. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) Winifred go on. Off to bed. Off to bed! Come on, come on. 
WINNIE But Father! I saw boxtrolls again! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND Shoo. Shoo. Shoo. 
Portley-Rind's eyes keep sliding back toward the room behind him, where the others are tasting another fine cheese. 
WINNIE They're right outside. They could come rip the flesh off my bones any moment! 
Behind them: LOUD grunts of satisfied tasting. 
WHITE HATS (O.S.) (IN UNISON) Would be a shame to miss this, Portley-Rind! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (CALLING BACK) Yes, yes one moment! (to Winnie, distracted) Winifred, proper girls should not be obsessing over grotesque monsters. 
Portley-Rind's attention is directed to the shenanigans going on behind him. 
WINNIE I'm not obsessed! I just can't stop imagining them gnawing off my toes and stringing them together as a necklace! Father? Father. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (NOT LISTENING) Mmm hmm. Yes. 
Portley-Rind turns back and pats Winnie on the head like she is a little dog. 
WINNIE (TESTING HIM) If they kidnapped me and slurped up my intestines like noodles, would you give up your white hat to save me? 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (still not listening) Hmm? Um. Yes, Winifred. 
WINNIE Father! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND What? Uh... White Hat? Right. (looks at his hat) What.. Oh, seems to have been smudged by a bit of brie. Be a dear and have the butler give it a wash, would you? 
He hands a stunned Winnie his White Hat and turns her toward the stairs. 
WINNIE BUT-- 
He closes the door on her before she can finish her thought. 
INT. CHEESE GUILD - MEZZANINE 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (O.S.) Now gentlemen, I apologize... sorry! Back to important White Hat business... Pass the Camembert! 
Winnie is hurt and frustrated. She looks down at the White Hat in her hands. Her eyes narrow. 
WINNIE I'll give your hat a wash all right. 
EXT. MARKET SQUARE - WINNIE'S BALCONY - NIGHT 
High on the front of the Guild, Winnie bursts through a set of french doors and onto a balcony holding the white hat, her face an angry scowl. 
She tosses Lord Portley-Rind's hat, frisbee style, out into the night sky. The hat glows in the moonlight as it sails across the Market Square. 
EXT. MARKET SQUARE 
The white hat hits the ground in the middle of the square. 
EXT. MARKET SQUARE - WINNIE'S BALCONY - CONTINUOUS 
She smiles, satisfied, dusts her hands. 
WINNIE Ha! 
Then, her smile slowly melts as she realizes this was not her brightest move. She hears raucous laughter from the Tasting Room. 
(0600 SPR) SNATCHER   AND   LORD   PORTLEY-RIND 
INT. CHEESE GUILD - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT 
-- and approaches the foot of the main stairs. 
SNATCHER (CALLING OUT) Lord Portley-Rind! 
CLOSE ON the TASTING ROOM DOORS. 
SFX Muffled voices of White Hats enjoying themselves suddenly stop. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (O.S.) (MUFFLED) Did you hear something? 
Winnie winces. She turns to Snatcher who is admiring the white hat again. 
WINNIE (DESPERATE) Can I have the hat back now? 
Snatcher puts the hat behind his back, grins and pulls Winnie up the stairs by her wrist, toward the Tasting Room. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) (PLEADING) Please. 
Portley-Rind bursts out to see Snatcher ascending the stairs. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND What in Gouda's name is going on? Archibald Snatcher? 
SNATCHER Deepest apologies, your Lordship. But I found something out in the street that belongs to you. 
Snatcher gestures behind him revealing a sheepish Winnie. As he turns he also reveals the white hat. Portley-Rind rushes down the stairs to meet Snatcher half way and GRABS THE HAT. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND My White Hat! 
Winnie looks stricken. 
WINNIE Huh? 
As Portley-Rind pulls on the hat, Snatcher refuses to let it go, so they tug each other up and down the stairs. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND I'll take that... Now, now, Snatcher one doesn't acquire a white hat by simply-- (STRAINING) --picking it up... off the street. 
Portley-Rind finally wins the tussle and grabs the hat back. He growls under his breath at the smudges left on the brim. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) (WITH EMPHASIS) A white hat indicates privilege, prestige, position! (THEN) It must be earned. 
He removes a handkerchief from his breast pocket and dabs at the hat's brim. 
From the top of the stairs the other Guild members chime in. 
LANGSDALE With Valor! 
BOULANGER Chivalry! 
BRODERICK Or being rich! That's how I got it. 
Snatcher looks up at them and bows, removing his red hat. 
SNATCHER Oh, don't I know it, sirs. 
Snatcher climbs the stairs and gets face to face with Portley- Rind. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) Fortunately, we still have our little... agreeeeement. 
Portley-Rind grimaces, remembering. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND Um.. ehhh... 
Snatcher opens his arms, gesturing widely, as he recites the particulars of the deal. 
SNATCHER When I destroy every last boxtroll in this town, I shall earn my white hat... and join you in the Tasting Room. 
Snatcher takes a step toward the Tasting Room door and looks longingly into its warm, inviting interior. The White Hats reach back and slam the doors shut. Snatcher's face falls. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND Good lord. (twists his mustache) Not sure who should be more terrified - the boxtrolls or us. 
The White Hats chuckle. Snatcher's expression drops into a scowl. Portley-Rind puts his hat back on. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) Now, how the devil did my hat get outside in the first place? 
Snatcher smirks and gestures toward Winnie. 
SNATCHER I was told the wind had something to do with it. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND The wind, eh? 
Portley-Rind looks at Winnie and frowns. 
WINNIE Father, I'm sorry-- 
SNATCHER (INTERRUPTING) Sorry! Can't stay. Too much work to do. (DOFFS HAT) Miss Portley-Rind, your Lordship, Sirs. I bid you good night. I'm sure we'll be seeing each other again very, very soon. 
Snatcher oozes out the door. Portley-Rind looks at Winnie and shakes his head. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (EXASPERATED) Hmmmm.. Winnie... 
Winnie is about to defend herself when Snatcher pops his head back in and points to his head. 
SNATCHER Don't forget. I'm a size six-and-a- half. Order ahead. 
As he finally leaves, his hat gets caught in the door and he lets out a frustrated growl/groan. 
INT. BOXTROLL CAVERN - EGGS' NOOK 
CLOSE ON the spinning Quattro Sabatinos record. 
Eggs sits hunched over in despair with one finger resting on the music machine, causing it to play very, very, slowly. 
Behind Eggs we see Shoe's face appear. He stares at Eggs. 
BEAT 
Shoe throws a bug at Eggs. It bounces off his head. No reaction, so Shoe does it again... still no reaction. 
BEAT 
Shoe enters the nook. Eggs looks at him. Shoe holds out two hands full of yummy bugs. 
SHOE (gurgles) Bugs for dinner? 
Nothing. 
Shoe sighs, and puts a bug in his mouth. 
EGGS (QUIETLY) Why do we do this, Shoe... 
Shoe stops eating, opens his mouth as if to answer then pauses, agape. The bug crawls out and up onto the top of his head. Shoe thinks, gurgling. 
EGGS (CONT'D) Carry on like everything is normal? They drag us away and we do nothing... 
The lucky bug extends it's wings and flies away. Shoe doesn't react. He doesn't know what to say. 
SFX: THE CLOCK GOES OFF SIGNALING TIME TO SLEEP. 
Shoe glances out of the cave as the remaining boxtrolls start to make what's left of the communal sleeping pile. 
Shoe looks back and forth between Eggs and the sleeping pile. He knows he should stay, but the sleeping pile is really coming together out there. With a whine of frustration for his friend, he shakes off some bugs for Eggs to eat and leaves. 
Eggs sighs and looks over to the corner where Fish's old saw and bow lean against the wall. 
The bugs Shoe left crawl up Eggs' arm and he angrily shoves them away and notices the Quattro Sabatino's RECORD COVER. 
CLOSE ON: The faces of the four singers, each one festooned with an elaborate mustache, and then on to their orange and brown striped coats and finally focussing on their straw boater hats. Eggs lowers it to reveal-- 
INT. BOXTROLL CAVERN - DRESSING AREA - LATER 
--Eggs REFLECTION IN AN OLD CRACKED MIRROR. He is wearing a disguise based on the singers from the Quattro Sabatino's record cover (which he holds in his hand). He has made a striped jacket by sewing strips of orange fabric to an old coat and found a filthy old straw boater. He has even drawn a twirled Van Dyck mustache on his face with a lump of coal. 
EGGS (HOPEFUL) I look like one of them. (DOUBTFUL) (SIGH) Sort of. 
He looks at the pile of sleeping boxtrolls as they snore. He looks back at the mirror. 
EGGS (CONT'D) (DETERMINED) I'll find you, Fish! 
He tiptoes out into the cavern and sneaks off into the shadows. 
INT. SEWER - DAY - MOMENTS LATER 
In a pitch black sewer, a thin ray of sunlight shoots down from a hole in a manhole cover. 
Eggs' filthy hand, wrapped in torn strips of fabric, reaches into the light. Dust motes drift around his hand and glow. The reflected light illuminates Eggs' wide eyed face. 
(0800) DAYLIGHT 
DOWN SHOT: Eggs climbs up toward the manhole. He has to squint at the bright sunlight. 
EGGS POV: Looking up at the manhole until the bright light fills the screen. 
SFX: As we go into the light, the sound of the streets of a bustling city gets louder and louder. 
EXT. MARKET STREET - DAY 
CLOSE ON: A heavy cast iron manhole as it grinds open. Blinding sunlight pours in. 
Eggs' dirty face peeks out. His eyes go wide. 
EGGS (AMAZED) Wow... 
KLANG! A fat man steps on the manhole cover and slams it shut. 
EGGS (O.S.) (CONT'D) Ahh! 
A beat. The manhole opens again (KLANG!!), and again is slammed shut as it is driven over, by a CART that stops. 
Eggs shoves the manhole open and clambers out. For a second he's reassured at how calm it is then the cart moves off and he is left crouching in the middle of a busy street. He looks up and is BLINDED BY THE SUN. AAARGH! 
DRUM BEATS and a CYMBAL CRASH! Eggs jumps out of the way as a ONE MAN BAND marches through, almost running him over. He's pushed and shoved by a festive crowd... 
EGGS (CONT'D) AHHHH!!! 
TOWNSPERSON 1 Outta the way! 
Until he backs into an OLD TIMEY BACKDROP painted with lurid images of monstrous boxtrolls stealing a wailing baby. 
PHOTOGRAPHER Get yer picture taken with the Trubshaw Baby! A humorous keepsake for this dark and dreadful day! 
EGGS AHHHH!! (rights himself) Eek. 
Eggs stumbles backwards into the crowd where he is crushed between pedestrians until he is lifted off the ground and carried along. 
EGGS (CONT'D) Ehh! Oof. Eek! 
EXT. INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND 
Eggs reaches an intersection and stops at the street signs: MILK AVE and CURDS WAY. He looks around at the industrial wasteland. In the distance is one lone building with a bloody red top hat painted on the huge wooden door. 
Eggs heads toward it. 
INT. SNATCHER'S FACTORY 
CLOSE ON Snatcher's grimy hands holding up a white hat made out of paper. 
SNATCHER Men, don your white hats. 
Snatcher lowers the paper hat onto his head. Across the table from him the Redhats replace their red hats with paper white hats. They all sit at a table set with cracked crockery and mismatched plates. 
MR. PICKLES Are you sure about this, boss? You know what cheese can do to you... 
SNATCHER (tucking a napkin into his COLLAR) Unless you are referring to how cheese brings men of respect and power together in brotherhood, no, I do not know what... (LOOMING MENACINGLY) "Cheese. Does. To. Me." 
MR. PICKLES (GULPS) That's what I meant then. 
SNATCHER Marvelous! Then let us begin. 
Trout takes a little piece of cheese out of a package labeled "EXTRA MILD CHEDDAR". He focuses and cuts off the tiniest little sliver and puts it on a plate, inspects it and slices it into an even smaller piece... then slices it again... and again... and again... and-- 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) (YELLS) ENOUGH! 
Snatcher bangs his fist on the table. Startled, Pickles and Trout jump. Then Trout puts a tiny slice of cheese on a plate and very slowly rotates the top of the table like a Lazy Susan. It takes forever for Snatcher's plate to arrive in front of him. 
Snatcher loses patience and spins the table so that a plate lands in front of him. As he moves to pierce the cheese with his fork, the plate shifts to the left. He glares at Mr. Trout and Mr. Pickles, who turned the table top. They immediately return the plate. 
The Redhats stare nervously as Snatcher stabs the curd and raises it to his lips and places it on his tongue. He chews, relishing it, then swallows. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) (SMILING) Mmmm! 
The Redhats relax. They take a tiny piece of cheese each and eat it. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) I say, old chaps, it's quite, um... QUITE-- 
MR. TROUT --Aromatic? Oaky? With an undertone of a mother's smile on a warm spring day? Hmm... 
SNATCHER Yes! Those things! Etcetera etcetera, big words, chummy banter... 
As the Redhats look on in horror, red spots appear across Snatcher's face. He scratches at them absently. 
MR. PICKLES (whispered to Trout) Someone's got the cheese fits again. 
MR. TROUT (SHUDDERS) Ohhh... (whispered to Gristle) Quickly, quietly, get the leeches. 
Gristle scurries away, crossing behind Snatcher. 
MR. GRISTLE QUIETLY! 
SNATCHER (SLURRED) Where is he going? Is he getting more cheese? 
Snatcher's lips instantly PUFF UP into huge, wobbly, distended FISH LIPS. The Redhats stare-- 
MR. GRISTLE Quietly! 
SNATCHER What? 
MR. PICKLES (SCARED) I think you've had enough for today, boss. 
In the background, Eggs' silhouette appears in the soot- covered window. He wipes away the grime to look in. 
EXT. SNATCHER'S FACTORY - DAY 
Eggs looks away from the window up at a large, rickety AIR DUCT attached to the side of the building. He climbs into the duct, leaving his disguise behind. 
INT. SNATCHER'S FACTORY - DAY 
BACK TO SCENE. Snatcher's face is now grotesquely misshapen and one eye has swollen shut like Quasimodo. 
SNATCHER (slurred by swollen lips) Isn't this nice? Chewing the cheddar with the big cheessses. Holding my own-- (GULPS CHEESE) --With sssophissstication and sssavoir faire! 
Pickles, and Trout sit nervously at the table and stare at him. 
MR. PICKLES (SUPER WORRIED) Yup. Nothing terrifying about that. 
MR. TROUT (rubs his neck, nervously) Uh huh huh... 
SNATCHER Thisss is where I belong! 
He leans back in his "throne" and begins orating again. 
MR. TROUT Spot on, as always, sir. 
Eggs appears peeking out of the air duct high on the factory wall. 
MR. PICKLES (O.S.) You're not wrong, boss. 
SNATCHER (ANGRY) Well not here! In this rotten factory! 
Snatcher quickly leans forward, slams his fist on the table and stands. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) I belong up there! 
Eggs shrinks back into the duct, afraid that Snatcher has noticed him. 
MR. TROUT (O.S.) I'm agreeing so I don't upset you. 
ON SNATCHER: He has lost his balance and crashed to the floor. Trout and Pickles twist their hands, unsure of what to do, as Snatcher lays atop the broken table. 
SNATCHER (GROGGY) I'm alright. Just give me a hand. 
Snatcher holds up his cheese-covered hand and the hand suddenly SWELLS UP into a grotesque meat glove! 
MR. PICKLES (DISGUSTED) Ugh. Mother of sausages! 
MR. TROUT (O.S.) Holy meat glove! 
Eggs looks horrified at the sight of Snatcher's giant hand. 
Fish won't come out of the box so Eggs is forced to lug him like a sack of concrete to the wall beneath the heating duct. 
Trout and Pickles help Snatcher up. 
MR. TROUT (CONT'D) Upsy daisy now, boss. Let's get you a nice cuppa tea-- 
Snatcher SMACKS Trout away with his swollen hand - (YELP!)- 
MR. PICKLES AAAH! Mister Snatcher! 
-- and stares at Pickles. His eyes are swollen nearly shut and blink spastically. 
SNATCHER'S POV: Blurry and distorted at first, then, at each blink, Pickles morphs into Lord Portley-Rind, white hat and all. 
MR. PICKLES/PORTLEY-RIND Huh? (UNEASY) ... What is it, Mr. Snatcher? 
SNATCHER You. 
MR. PICKLES/LPR Me? 
SNATCHER GIVE ME THAT HAT! 
He LUNGES AT PICKLES (AHHHH!) and chokes him with his giant cheese hand! 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) I'll make those brie stuffed pigs bow down to me! I'm going to be somebody! 
Pickles wrestles Snatcher's swollen face into a headlock. 
MR. PICKLES AHH! I got him! Do it! 
MR. TROUT MR. GRISTLE NOW! 
MR. PICKLES NOW! NOW! NOW!! 
Gristle runs up and hurls the jar of leeches onto Snatcher's face. 
MR. GRISTLE LEECHES! 
SNATCHER AHHHHH! UGH. OOF. GAHHH! 
Snatcher grunts and yells then everything goes silent, except for the sucking sound of the leeches. Mr. Trout shrinks away and Mr. Gristle grins, enjoying the spectacle. 
ON EGGS: Eggs is horrified by the sight of the leeches sucking on Snatcher's swollen face. 
EGGS Eww! (TO FISH) You have got to help me, Fish! 
FISH (gurgles) Okay. 
Fish sticks his right arm out of the box. 
EGGS (groan) Uggggh. 
Eggs grabs Fish's arm and swings the whole box over his shoulder so he is wearing Fish like a back pack. Then Eggs grabs a pipe on the wall and climbs toward the duct. 
They swell up larger and larger as Snatcher's face shrinks back down to normal. They drop off one at a time and squish at Snatcher's feet. 
Snatcher flicks off the last few leeches and flips his hair. His face is marred with red spots from the suckers but has returned to its normal size. 
SNATCHER (GROGGY) Oh, hello. Where were we? 
MR. TROUT We was about to... uhh... 
MR. GRISTLE (quietly, gestures with the empty jar) Leeches. 
MR. TROUT ... Put that new boxtroll to work. Ain't that right, Mr. Pickles? 
Mr. Pickles stumbles over, rubbing his sore neck. 
MR. PICKLES That is correct. 
SNATCHER Ah yes... right. Open the workshop Mr. Trout! 
Trout runs to a lever and pulls it. 
(1250 EMS) EGGS MEETS SNATCHER 
INT SNATCHER'S FACTORY - DAY 
The factory is filled with load-grinding sounds as a steam wheel turns. Huge timbers in the wooden floor PULL OPEN, REVEALING A DARK PIT BELOW in the FACTORY SUB-LEVEL. 
Eggs and Fish are still a few feet short of the air duct. Eggs heaves Fish halfway into the duct and has to stretch out over empty space to push him in. 
Snatcher and the Redhats reach Fish's empty cage. 
SNATCHER Huh? Where is the beast? 
Eggs pushes Fish half into the duct while hanging from the swinging cage. Fish is looking straight down, suddenly his eyes go wide! 
SNATCHER (NERVOUSLY) Miss Portley-Rind! What a surprise! (MORE) 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) Does your.. does your father know you're here? 
WINNIE (DISMISSIVE) No of course not! (up to Eggs) But wait til I tell him! The Trubshaw Baby! Alive! 
Winnie sees Trout towering over her. 
MR. TROUT (REGRETFULLY) Sorry, miss. 
Winnie looks at Snatcher in horror and confusion. Trout picks her up in his big hands. 
WINNIE What are you doing? Unhand me! 
SNATCHER Looks like the Boxtrolls have a new victim, miss. And her name is YOU. 
Gristle remembers Eggs. He swings his bat over his head and brings it down but Eggs leaps, grabs the rope from Pickles' missed shot, and SWINGS LIKE TARZAN towards the door that Winnie opened. 
Trout panics as he sees Eggs swinging towards him. He holds Winnie up to protect his face. Eggs barrels into Trout's belly, knocking him backward and getting him wedged in the door. 
(1300 WCH) WASTELAND CHASE 
EXT. SNATCHER'S FACTORY - DAY 
Eggs and Winnie tumble outside the factory and roll to a stop in a cloud of dust. 
SNATCHER They're getting away Mr. Gristle! 
WINNIE (PANICKED) What have you dragged me into? 
Fish calls to them from a manhole. 
FISH Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! Eggs! 
EGGS RUN! 
Eggs and Winnie run. 
EXT. INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND 
Still running Eggs and Winnie suddenly hear a loud CRASH! 
Behind them Gristle comes crashing through a high window swinging on a chain. 
MR. GRISTLE I'm swinging on a chain! 
EGGS/WINNIE AHHH! 
Eggs and Winnie slide into the manhole that Fish holds open. They make it in and slam it shut just in time for Mr. Gristle to face plant on top of it. 
MR. GRISTLE Stuck on a manhole! 
Trout finally pops out of the factory doorway. He and Mr. Pickles come running up to the motionless Mr. Gristle, standing over him. 
MR. TROUT Oww... 
MR. PICKLES Don't make no sense. That's evil prevailing over good. 
Snatcher arrives. 
SNATCHER (TO TROUT) If Lord Portley-Rind finds out that boy is alive, it will ruin everything I've worked for! 
MR. TROUT You mean, we worked for? 
Snatcher glares at Mr. Trout, silent. 
MR. PICKLES I think we're all saying the same thing here. 
MR. TROUT I don't think we are. 
SNATCHER (ANNOYED) Bah... 
Snatcher walks away, frustrated. 
MR. PICKLES But, just in different ways. 
(1400 FMR) FAMILY   REUNION 
INT BOXTROLL CAVERN - ENTRANCE CHUTES - MOMENTS LATER 
Winnie screams as she flies down the chutes, into the cavern, down the conveyor belt, and crashes into the boxtroll sleeping pile. 
INT BOXTROLL CAVERN - NIGHT 
Winnie lays amongst the scattered boxes. She pushes herself upright, coughing. Boxtrolls poke their heads out all around her and stare. 
WINNIE (gasp) Ohh! 
Winnie gets as far away from the boxtrolls as she can, bumping into Knickers as she shuffles backwards. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) STAY AWAY FROM ME! Someone, help!!! Wealthy girl in danger! 
She pushes herself against a wall. The boxtrolls gather, curious. Winnie spots Shoe nearby, with worms and bugs dangling from his mouth. She hides behind a cabbage, whimpering. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) If you're going to eat me just get it over with. I'm sure I'm delicious. 
Suddenly there is the sound of happy boxtrolls gurgling and drumming their boxes. 
Winnie peeks out. The boxtrolls are surrounding Eggs and Fish and celebrating their return. No one is paying any attention to her. 
Fish starts gurgling and keeps gurgling, his face suggesting that he's conveying something from long-long ago... 
FISH [GURGLE GURGLE] 
Winnie stands by Eggs, watching Fish curiously. 
WINNIE What's he saying? 
EGGS Oh, sorry. He says a long time ago there was a kind man-- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
(1500 TBB) TRUBSHAW BABY 
INT. TRUBSHAW KITCHEN (FLASHBACK) - NIGHT 
Fish and Shoe stand beside a rubbish bin, tinkering with a WHIRLIGIG CONTRAPTION. 
EGGS (V.O.) -- The one man in town who saw they weren't monsters... 
SFX: A baby GIGGLES. 
Fish and Shoe startle and hide in their boxes. The whirligig clatters to the ground. 
EGGS (V.O.) ... But builders... like him. 
POV FISH: Herbert Trubshaw stands at an open window to his second-floor workshop, holding a BABY in his arms. Instead of chasing them away he SMILES at them. 
Fish and Shoe slowly lift their heads out of their boxes, returning the smile. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
ANOTHER NIGHT: Herbert, baby Eggs, and Fish sit on the back stoop and discuss an invention. As Herbert talks, Fish casually takes it from him and tweaks it. 
HERBERT I've tried adjusting the dongle and there doesn't seem to be any possible solut-- Oh look, you've solved it! 
Fish laughs with Herbert. Herbert hands Baby Eggs to Fish, and he holds the child at arm's length. 
HERBERT (CONT'D) Who's up for a jelly break? 
Fish stares at Baby Eggs as Herbert eats a spoonful of jelly. They smile at each other. 
HERBERT (CONT'D) (VOICE FADES) I tell you I could eat this stuff for the rest of my life. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
ANOTHER NIGHT: Fish and Shoe enter the back yard and freeze as they step into light. 
HERBERT (CONT'D) But one night... 
In the second story windows, menacing silhouettes of Snatcher and Gristle loom over Herbert, who clutches baby Eggs to his chest. 
Snatcher's muffled voice can be heard threatening Herbert and the baby. 
SNATCHER (O.S.) Come on! I'm being reasonable. I can be unreasonable. 
EGGS (V.O.) Snatcher wanted him to build something... 
HERBERT I-- I'm an inventor, not a killer! 
Eggs (V.O.) But he refused... 
LIGHTNING CRASHES. 
Fish stares up at the window.    At Snatcher's loud threat, Shoe runs away. 
EGGS (V.O.) And when the Redhats tried to take me away from him... 
Snatcher's silhouette moves menacingly towards Herbert. 
SNATCHER Maybe if I hold on to your son... 
Herbert shoves Snatcher away. Snatcher growls. 
HERBERT Not my boy! 
Herbert kicks Gristle and opens the window. He places the baby into a box pulley system that dangles from the upper floors. He untethers the rope, yelling to Fish. 
HERBERT (CONT'D) RUN! PROTECT MY--UGHH! 
Herbert is tackled by Gristle. 
Fish watches the crying baby lower to the ground in an Eggs box. He is frozen with fear. 
EGGS (V.O.) And then they... 
Snatcher CLUBS Herbert across the head and Herbert goes down hard. Dead. The baby CRIES. 
Snatcher looks out the window, panting from exertion, and sees Fish staring up in shock. 
Thunder BOOMS, lightning FLASHES, and RAIN POURS DOWN as Fish bolts through the gate and out of the yard with Baby Eggs still in the Eggs box. 
BACK TO: 
INT BOXTROLL CAVERN - NIGHT 
Eggs holds his box, staring forlornly down at his label. 
WINNIE (O.S.) They what? 
WINNIE (CONT'D) No. 
Shoe growls and walks off. 
- Bucket offers Winnie a JAR OF BUTTONS. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) Oh yes! 
- Winnie holds up the jar and selects a BUTTON. 
- Shoe offers Winnie a TOILET PLUNGER. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) No! 
Shoe angrily tosses the plunger aside and storms off. 
- Fragile offers Winnie a pair of shoes. She excitedly swipes them from his hands. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) Yes! 
Fragile is frightened and hides, whimpering. 
REVEAL Eggs in the broken mirror dressed in a surprisingly fashionable suit made of trash. 
He looks like the Little Lord Fauntleroy of the junk yard. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) You look like a proper boy. 
The boxtrolls look like proud parents. They nod and grumble in approval. 
Eggs looks at his warped reflection in an old, broken mirror. He looks stunned by his own transformation. 
EGGS (TO HIMSELF) Me... a proper boy. 
Eggs smiles sweetly, standing tall. 
WINNIE How do we get out of this place? 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAVERN - PNEUMATIC TUBES 
A MOMENT LATER: Specs turns an ANCHOR attached to the wall. 
Winnie stands underneath the cracked bell, the mouth of the PNEUMATIC TUBES, confused. 
FWOOMP! A shocked Winnie gets sucked up a PNEUMATIC TUBE while Eggs watches, bemused. 
WINNIE AHHHHHHHH! 
(1700 PTY) PARTY 
EXT. MARKET SQUARE - NIGHT 
Eggs and Winnie (woozy, her hair frazzled from the tube ride) crawl out of a manhole. 
WINNIE Come on, Eggs. 
They climb the Guild stairs together. Winnie pats down her hair as Eggs lopes past her like a nervous boxtroll. He wipes his nose with the back of his hand, wipes it on his pants, adjusting his disguise as he reaches for the door handle. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) (SHRIEKS) STOP! 
Eggs stops, eyes wide. Winnie pushes him away from the door. They stop in front of the tall guild door. Sounds of party guests can be heard. Winnie turns to Eggs. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) You don't scratch there in public! That's why they're called... (WHISPERED) ... privates. 
Winnie looks around to make sure nobody saw that. 
EGGS (WHISPERED) Okay. 
WINNIE For this is to work, there are a few things you need to know. When you meet someone, you must look them in the eye and shake hands. 
Eggs OPENS HIS EYEBALLS STUPIDLY WIDE and WIGGLES HIS HANDS in the air like a lunatic. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) What are you doing?! Put those down! 
She pulls his hands down. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) Like this. 
Eggs puts his left hand out. She slaps it away. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) The other one. 
EGGS Oh, right. 
She shoves his hand into hers -- a proper shake. 
WINNIE Then you say, (SNOBBISH) "It's a pleasure to meet you." 
EGGS (IMPERSONATING WINNIE'S SNOBBISH VOICE) "It's a pleasure to meet you." 
WINNIE And you say that even if you're not pleased to meet them. 
Eggs looks confused, but nods yes anyway. A look of doubt comes over Winnie's face. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) (SIGHS) Just stick close, okay? 
She opens the huge doors and the elegant sound of chamber music and civilized conversation pours out. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND What have you done!? 
Eggs begins to speak... haltingly at first... but then growing in confidence. 
EGGS Lord Winnie's Father... 
The crowd and Portley-Rind all turn and stare at Eggs. 
EGGS (CONT'D) People of the upper world -- Archibald Snatcher has lied to you all! 
Frou Frou/Snatcher looks at the crowd and GULPS! 
EGGS (CONT'D) He told you that boxtrolls are monsters -- that they steal children -- but they don't. They would never hurt anyone. I know because... 
Eggs looks to Winnie.   She nods, encouraging him. 
EGGS (CONT'D) Because... I am the Trubshaw Baby! 
A long beat. CLOSE ON LORD PORTLEY-RIND as he seems to be thinking intensely... 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND Do you know how expensive that cheese was? 
EGGS What?! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (FLIPPANT) We might as well have built a children's hospital! 
WINNIE Did you hear a word he said?! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (dismissive, to Winnie) Not now. 
WINNIE BUT FATHER-- 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (points to White Hats) Have you any idea how long it will take my men to fish it out of the river?! 
The White Hats look worried. Boulanger rolls forward in his wheelchair and adjusts his hearing horn. 
LANGSDALE Ahh. What? 
BOULANGER Eww... the river? 
Eggs moves down the stairs. 
EGGS If you won't listen to me, ask Snatcher himself. 
Eggs PULLS OFF SNATCHER'S WIG. A long beat, as Snatcher looks caught. 
CROWD (SHOCK) GASP!/ Oh my! 
MADAME FROU FROU/SNATCHER (whimpers) You have me. I am not a true red head. 
LADY CYNTHIA (sympathy for Frou Frou) Poor woman. 
SIR LANGSDALE (sympathy for Frou Frou) For shame. 
Now the crowd turns ANGRY. 
CROWD MEN How rude! / The lad's fuddled! / An outrage! / The very thought! (MORE) I saw him bite a bug on a cracker!/ He must hate cheese! / He's a mad man! / I believe her's wearing a lamp shade as a sleeve! 
CROWD LADIES Nasty boy! / Oh, he's awful! (MORE) That's the one who crawled under my dress! / I knew he was up to no good the second he goosed me. / My husband is angry so I am too! 
Portley-Rind angrily climbs the stairs to Eggs. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND You insult our guest of honor? 
He grabs the wig away from Eggs. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) Who are you?! 
EGGS (SHEEPISH) A proper boy. 
WINNIE He is with me father. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND You know this... creature? 
WINNIE He's my friend. What he said is TRUE-- 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND Enough! 
WINNIE But... 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND Winifred! 
Winnie gives in and bows her head. Eggs is stunned and hurt. Portley-Rind turns on him. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (CONT'D) (TO EGGS) I don't want to see you again, do you hear me? 
EGGS But he's not a... 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND Leave my house. Now! 
Eggs walks slowly down the stairs. As he passes, Frou Frou/Snatcher smiles an evil grin. 
Eggs glares at Snatcher and walks past Winnie without even looking at her. She looks heartbroken. 
The crowd shuffles away from Eggs as he walks out the door. The butler wordlessly shuts it behind him. 
The music begins again and the crowd goes back to chatting. Portley-Rind hands the wig back to Madame Frou Frou and leads her down the stairs. 
SNATCHER Zees parties are so confusing. No? 
Two big spot lights BLAST ON like eyes, and the mecha box drill rises up on three legs. As it rises, it tears walkways and lights from the cavern walls. 
BOXTROLLS AHHHHHHHH!!!!! 
As it turns, it rips the intricate boxtroll clock from its stalagmite and sends it crashing down. The mecha box looks like a monstrous, giant mechanical boxtroll. 
The mecha box's spotlight "eyes" cut through the dust and darkness, catching each fleeing boxtroll, making them instinctively STOP RUNNING and HIDE in their boxes! 
Snatcher's head appears out of the top. He still has his Madame Frou Frou white pancake makeup on, with a slash of crimson lipstick, making him look crazier than ever. 
SNATCHER How's that for an entrance! 
Trout, Pickles and Gristle emerge from beneath the machine. 
MR. PICKLES (CHEERING) Dramatical! 
MR. TROUT Don't you mean "dramatic"? 
Mr. Gristle laughs insanely. 
Snatcher hits a lever and a large MECHANICAL ARM unfolds from the drill. Snatcher laughs heartily as he plays with his new toy, opening and closing the CLAW at the arm's end. He swings the claw at stalactites, sending them crashing to the ground. 
EGGS AHH! 
Eggs shoves boxtrolls out of the way as the rocks fall to the cavern floor. 
Some jump out of the way and Snatcher swings again, sending the clawed arm into Eggs' nook, smashing the music machine. 
Eggs drags boxtrolls towards the pneumatic tubes -- but they stay in their boxes refusing to move. 
EGGS (CONT'D) Get up! That thing will kill you! 
SNATCHER My, my, what a surprise. Don't look like your little friends wanna run, does it? (THEN) How strange, how peculiar. No, wait, it's exactly as I expected! 
Eggs stacks a group of boxtrolls under the tubes, all of them still tucked into their boxes, and pleads. 
EGGS You have to get up. Please! 
SNATCHER NEVER GONNA HAPPEN, TRUBSHAW! 
Eggs turns the anchor switch and the boxes start to rise into the tubes. The mecha box's claw arm GRABS the tube and rips it out of the machine. Cocoa falls! There's no way out. 
Eggs jumps out of the way as the mecha claw arm drops the tube overhead. He rights himself and gasps up at Snatcher in at the mecha drill controls. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) Time to earn my white hat! 
Snatcher pulls another LEVER and releases the VACUUM ARM. It slithers toward a group of boxtrolls. Eggs whimpers as Snatcher hits the lever's BUTTON to begin the suction. 
The boxtrolls in front of Eggs get sucked up by the mecha box's vacuum arm. He tries to hold on a boxtroll mid-suction but it is ripped away. 
EGGS No! 
The mecha box's vacuum arm turns on other boxtrolls. 
Sweets and Knickers grab hold of boulders. Knickers nearly loses his/her bottom box as he/she is hoovered up. Sweets' teeth are sucked out of his mouth, then he is sucked up. 
A panicked Eggs looks around, eyes wide. 
EGGS (CONT'D) Fish! Shoe! 
Eggs grabs Fish and Shoe by their arms, where they try to hold themselves together. He tries to run with them in tow. Gristle clubs Shoe toward the vacuum arm with his cricket bat, where he is sucked up. 
Eggs and Fish huddle together as Snatcher rides up, headlights blaring. Eggs has to shield his eyes from the blinding light. 
Eggs picks Fish up, wrapping his arms around the box as best he can. 
EGGS (CONT'D) NO! Please! 
SNATCHER Give up, Trubshaw! Boxtrolls lost looooong time ago. These miserable pests will never be a match for a man with dream! (THEN) MR. GRISTLE! 
Eggs holds Fish tightly and tries to run but Gristle fires his bolas gun after him. It wraps around them and they fall to the ground. Eggs lands hard and hits his head, knocking him unconscious. Fish peeks out of his box, fretting. 
FISH Eggs? Eggs? 
Snatcher flips levers and switches, grinding gears and sending flames out of the drill's FURNACE GRILL as the machine stands. He points to Eggs. 
SNATCHER ACQUIRE THEM! 
As Snatcher stomps away, the Redhats step in and pull Fish out of the bolas rope. Fish's head comes out of his box and screams. 
FISH (SNARLS FEROCIOUSLY) 
He HISSES AND BARES HIS TEETH at the Redhats! Pickles and Trout jump back! Gristle knocks Fish unconscious with the butt of his rifle. Trout and Pickles recoil. 
MR. PICKLES Never seen one do that before! 
MR. GRISTLE THAT BOXTROLL WAS MAD! 
Gristle walks back toward the mecha box, laughing. Pickles look shocked at Fish's flaccid body. Trout picks up the limp Eggs and slings him over his shoulder. 
MR. PICKLES Goodness always triumphs over evil... right Mr. Trout? (Trout walks away) Mr. Trout? 
Pickles picks up Fish and follows Trout. 
MR. PICKLES (CONT'D) (CONVINCING HIMSELF) I'm still sixty to seventy percent certain that's us. A couple of good guys vanquishing evil and all that. 
ON EGGS in the mecha drill's CAGE. He lies passed out atop a pile of boxtrolls. As the mecha box climbs back up the hole, it pushes a huge stalagmite over and the rest of the cavern collapses down around it. 
INSIDE THE MECHA BOX CAGE, EGGS' SEMI CONSCIOUS POV: he looks at the home he once knew, now destroyed. His eyes close. 
A beat. Then... 
SNATCHER Well, good speech. 
Snatcher pulls a lever, and-- 
SMASH! The box crusher flattens the entire pile of boxtrolls. 
EGGS No! No! No! NOOOOOO! (CRYING) Fish, Shoe, Sparky... 
Herbert is smiling and mumbling the same thing over and over. 
HERBERT Look what you did. Look what you did! (laughs) 
EGGS (TEARFUL) Yeah. Yeah look what I did. They're crushed. 
Snatcher appears, coming up the stairs. Eggs looks up at Snatcher in horror. 
MR. TROUT (REGRETFULLY) Hey, Boss, your monsters are all loaded. 
SNATCHER (staring right at Eggs) All but one. 
Eggs looks up, terrified. 
CUT TO: 
(2100 SAS) SNATCHER'S   ASCENSION 
EXT. CHEESEBRIDGE - WORLD VIEW - JUST BEFORE DAWN 
The wide view of rooftops and chimneys in golden morning light is marred by the SMOKE of a coal furnace. The Mecha Box Drill makes its way slowly up the hillside town. 
EXT. CHEESEBRIDGE STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
Snatcher's amplified voice booms out of a scratchy loudspeaker and through the sleepy morning streets, rousing the townsfolk. Lights appear in windows. 
SNATCHER (O.S.) Hear ye! Hear ye! Good citizens of Cheesebridge, come out of your homes! The curfew has been lifted! 
QUICK SHOTS OF TOWNSPEOPLE, the reverse of the opening scene of the movie: 
- A man OPENS his peep-hole and looks around. 
- Another OPENS his door and looks up as a shadow passes over his house. 
- A MOTHER swings her door open and a LITTLE BOY rushes outside to see: Snatcher riding atop the giant mecha drill as it lumbers up the winding streets towards Market Square. Trout and Pickles follow behind, with Mr. Gristle riding the back of the Mecha Drill. 
TOWNSFOLK BOY Whoah! What is it? 
FEMALE TOWNSFOLK 1 It's Snatcher! 
SNATCHER Fear not, the monsters have been vanquished! Your streets are SAFE! 
MR. GRISTLE (VERY MENACING) SAAAFE! 
Trout and Pickles walk along behind the machine, amongst the gathering crowd, worried. 
The townspeople smile in relief and wonder, and step out of their doors. 
MALE TOWNSFOLK (?) The curfew is over? 
MR. TROUT Yeah... 
FEMALE TOWNSFOLK 1 That's incredible. 
They begin to follow after the mecha drill. 
SNATCHER Join me! Your purger of pests! Your white knight who has taken back the night! 
As Snatcher continues his ascension, all kinds of townspeople, women, children, rush to join the parade. The Mecha Drill's heavy iron legs smash into the cobblestones as it walks up the hill. 
EXT. MARKET SQUARE - CHEESE GUILD - DAWN 
The crowd arrives at the stairs of the guild with the mecha box. Snatcher beams with pride as he calls out through the whiney loudspeaker. 
SNATCHER Lord Portley-Riiiiind! 
The door cracks open and Lord Portley-Rind looks out. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) I come bearing the most delightful news. 
He blinks in amazement at the scene before him - Snatcher atop a giant machine, a huge expectant crowd around him. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND Mr. Snatcher, what the devil is this? 
SNATCHER (TRIUMPHANT CHUCKLE) Show him lads. 
The Redhats release the crushed boxes from the cage so they fan out dramatically at the foot of the stairs. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) Flattened to extinction. Every last, slimy one of them. 
The crowd applauds. 
Up at her balcony, Winnie hears the noise and comes out to investigate. 
WINNIE (GASP) 
SNATCHER Your lordship, I said I would not rest until I caught every last boxtroll and I am a man of my word. 
He hits a switch and the mechanical arm swings around to present Eggs, wearing the evil-boxtroll costume Mr. Gristle wore in the Madame Frou Frou show. The mask covers Eggs' face and his hands are bound behind his box. His feet and hands are covered with grotesque claws. 
SNATCHER With this hat, I, Archibald Penelope Snatcher... 
Trout begins to lower Eggs into the furnace. He and Pickles are sweating, intensely reluctant to kill the boy. Portley- Rind slowly begins to lower the white hat onto Snatcher's head. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND With profound esteem for dairy and dairy products... proudly swear to uphold the dignity of the White Hat. 
The hat creeps lower as Portley-Rind matches the last boxtroll's progress toward the flames. 
SNATCHER (repeating after Portley- RIND) (MORE) 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) Proudly swear to uphold the dignity of the White Hat. 
Suddenly, Winnie bursts out the front doors and sees Eggs moving closer and closer to death. 
WINNIE Father! Father! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND Not now, Winifred! 
Exasperated, Winnie runs to Pickles and Trout. 
WINNIE STOP! STOP! 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND (O.S.) And henceforth, whereupon and thereupon... the placing of this hat... we shall conclude by... ushering our newest member into a world of privilege, pride, and pasteurized dairy! 
MR. TROUT I can't, miss. Apologies. 
MR. PICKLES We're just doing our jobs. 
WINNIE Your JOBS? Are you pest exterminators or evil henchmen?! 
MR. PICKLES (long, hurt gasp) I knew that's how people saw us. 
ON EGGS, mumbling against his mouth gag. 
WINNIE You don't have to do this! 
MR. TROUT She has a point, Mr. Pickles. This could be our chance for redemption. 
MR. PICKLES A second chapter! 
MR. TROUT People love a flawed hero! 
The FEET of Eggs' BOXTROLL COSTUME are licked by flames as he creeps closer to the furnace. 
WINNIE (HURRIEDLY) Sure, yes, whatever! Just let him go! 
Pickles and Trout stare at each other, unsure of what to do. 
ON SNATCHER and the white hat hovering so tantalizingly close to his head. 
ON EGGS as he shuts his lids tightly against the coal fire. 
ON the One Man Band, who is looking a little tired and sweaty from a really long drum-roll. 
Back to Trout and Pickles, who smile at each other. 
MR. TROUT Yeah? (at Mr. Pickles' nod) Yeah. 
Trout stops the machine and the mechanical arm reverses it's direction, moving Eggs away from the fire. 
EGGS (behind the gag) Huh? 
Snatcher growls as Lord Portley-Rind swiftly pulls his white hat away. 
ON the One Man Band as he finally stops his drum-roll, and collapses exhausted. 
Trout and Pickles turn to Winnie. 
MR. PICKLES Redeemed! 
MR. TROUT (TO WINNIE) Thank you, miss. 
Gristle LUNGES IN, seizes the controller. 
MR. GRISTLE Ha HA! 
WINNIE (PROTESTS) STOP IT! 
Winnie tries to take the controller from Gristle, but he snaps his teeth at her menacingly. 
Gristle turns the mecha drill arm back on! Eggs resumes his descent. 
Mr. Trout pulls Winnie out of the way. 
MR. TROUT Watch yourself. 
The tips of Eggs' boxtroll-suited feet are licked by the flames, and he pulls them up out of the way. 
Gristle laughs heartily at Eggs' precarious situation. 
MR. GRISTLE Ha Ha HAAAAA! 
In the quiet hush of the ceremony, suddenly a faint sound can be heard GROWING LOUDER. 
HERBERT (O.S.) Jelly! JELLY! Jelly! 
Gristle turns to the sound. 
MR. GRISTLE Hmm? 
SNATCHER Stop destroying my indestructible machine! 
Eggs barely ducks out of the way and falls, catching a hold of the arm joint and scrambling up to the front of the box. 
Snatcher keeps swinging the wrench again - KLANG! -, tracking Eggs. He SMASHES the left headlight of the mecha drill and reels back to swing again when-- 
Eggs grabs onto a lever, pulls it hard, and the mecha box tilts violently back, sending Snatcher tumbling to the edge. Smoke starts coming out of the furnace. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) AHHHHHHH!!!! 
Eggs presses the red button and THE VACUUM ARM SWINGS DOWN LIKE A GIANT ACCORDION. 
EGGS Fish, grab hold! 
ON CUE, Fish and Shoe scream directions. A group of boxtrolls run up to the vacuum arm and grab hold. They form a caterpillar conga-line to stretch it toward THE CENTER OF THE SQUARE. 
FISH (GURGLES "PULL!") 
Shoe pulls the manhole cover away from the hole. 
ON EGGS as he looks out over the square.   Snatcher looms in the furnace smoke. 
EGGS That's right! Pull it over there! 
Suddenly, Snatcher appears behind him. 
SNATCHER YOU FILTHY MONSTER! 
EGGS AHHHH! 
Snatcher grabs Eggs by the shoulders and forces him down over the edge of the mecha drill control booth. 
ON THE BOXTROLLS as Fish grabs the mouth of the vacuum and jumps down into the sewer, dangling ABOVE THE WATER! The vacuum can't reach! 
FISH (GURGLED) Uh oh. (GURGLED) IT DOESN'T REACH! 
WINNIE IT DOESN'T REACH! PULL IT HARDER! 
ON EGGS as Snatcher grasps his neck, threatening. 
SNATCHER (with effort, strangling EGGS) You think you can win and live happily ever after! They'll never accept the likes of us! 
Eggs pushes against Snatcher's chest, trying to get free. 
ON WINNIE, SHOE and the others as they STRAIN to pull the vacuum arm closer. Trout and Pickles have joined in. 
WINNIE ALL TOGETHER! 
MR. TROUT Now! 
MR. PICKLES Pull! 
CLOSE ON the mecha box's legs as they are dragged toward the manhole, pushing up cobblestones as they go. 
WITH Fish as the tube reaches the water. He scrambles up the vacuum tube as it crashes into the water, hard. 
MEANWHILE, Snatcher and Eggs struggle, their hands on each others' throats. 
EGGS I'm nothing like you. You're the monster! 
Snatcher pulls him close and GROWLS. 
SNATCHER MONSTER? 
Snatcher GROWLS and rears back with the wrench! Eggs reaches over and SLAMS down the vacuum ON SWITCH! 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) (SURPRISED) Huh? 
FOOOMP! Water is sucked up in HUGE GULPS that race up the tube! 
WATER HITS THE RED HOT FURNACE! BOOM! An EXPLOSION of steam and smoke fills the screen, obscuring our view. 
ON THE WHITE HAT as it sits on the cobblestones. Lord Portley- Rind picks it up with a chuckle and places it on his head. He twirls his mustache with delight. 
ON THE MECHA DRILL as it stands still, steam dissipating around its carcass. The vacuum arm is now just a stump of steel and shredded canvas. 
The boxtrolls and townsfolk stare at it through the steam. 
A LONG BEAT OF SILENCE is broken by shouts: 
WHITE HATS (O.S.) WE'VE DONE IT!/ HUZZAH!/ THREE CHEERS FOR US! 
Sir Langsdale, Sir Broderick, and Sir Boulanger crest the hill at Milk Street, pushing the giant CHEESE WHEEL that rolled into the river. 
SIR LANGSDALE We got the cheese. (they see the devastated SQUARE) Lord... Portley-... Rind? 
They stand in the entrance to the destroyed square, jaws agape. Glasses broken, an almost blind Gristle stumbles out, looking battered and worn. 
MR. GRISTLE UGH! I HAVE LOST A LOT OF BLOOD. 
Gristle looks up to see Snatcher and Eggs still clinging to the mecha box as it falls toward him! He spots Snatcher and watches as the box gets closer... 
MR. GRISTLE (CONT'D) Boss? 
Timbeeeeer! The mecha box drill crashes on to Mr. Gristle and sends Snatcher and Eggs flying SPLAT! into the GIANT CHEESE WHEEL! SMOKE, STEAM, AND MELTED CHEESE SPLATTER EVERYWHERE! 
The crowd watches while Fish runs to look for Eggs in the huge mound of cheese. Suddenly, Eggs GASPS and breaks through the cheese. Fish rushes to him. 
FISH (CONCERNED) Eggs? EGGS! 
Snatcher growls, shrugs it off, and raises the forkful of cheese to his mouth... then pauses. His STOMACH GURGLES loudly. Everyone else recoils, scared. Fish hides in his box. 
LONG PAUSE 
Snatcher raises the cheese to his mouth again. 
EGGS (GENTLE PLEA) Don't do it. It won't change who you are. 
His hideous, swollen head turns back to Eggs and he blinks. For a moment he looks sad, almost like he wants to listen to Eggs. 
EGGS (CONT'D) Cheese, hats, boxes - they don't make you. You make you. 
Snatcher looks sharply at Eggs. 
SNATCHER I have made me, boy. 
Snatcher looks back to the curd, ready. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) This is my dessshhtiny. 
Snatcher opens his mouth wide. 
ON EGGS, WINNIE, FISH, LORD PORTLEY-RIND as Snatcher slowly places the curd on his tongue. They are terrified. 
Snatcher chews loudly. 
Snatcher swallows.    He glances down to his stomach... 
Eggs and Fish flinch, expecting something terrible to happen. Even Portley-Rind and Winnie cower. 
A beat. 
Everything is fine. Everyone relaxes. A feeling of relief washes over Snatcher. His face brightens. 
SNATCHER (CONT'D) (POMPOUS) Mmm, aromatic?... Oaky?... With an undertone of a mother's smile on a WARM SPRING-- 
BOOOOOM!!! He explodes. 
EXT. WIDE OF CHEESEBRIDGE - DAY 
The top of the Guild explodes with a puff. The sound of the explosion is delayed slightly because of the distance. 
A beat as the smoke hangs in the air. The grazing cows gently MOO. 
(2600 PMY) PLEASED TO MEET YOU 
EXT. MARKET SQUARE ALLEY - DAY 
We see the clear, blue sky over Cheesebridge for a moment before tilting down into Market Square. 
WINNIE (O.S.) There I was, trapped in his sweaty armpit... 
Madame Frou Frou's cabaret cart has been repainted, with a new sign reading "WINNIE". Winnie stands mid-stage orating her horrific tale. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) ...Until he swelled like a balloon and.. POP! -- 
BLAM! A boxtroll bursts out of the trapdoor below the stage, releasing a cloud of confetti that explodes everywhere. They perform for a mixed crowd of townspeople and boxtrolls. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) (ARMS WIDE) -- An ocean of guts exploded over us like a hurricane of YUCK! 
The crowd applauds, townspeople clap their hands and boxtrolls drum their boxes. 
Lord Portley-Rind and Lady Cynthia applaud the loudest. 
LORD PORTLEY-RIND My little angel. My weird little angel. 
Winnie curtsies deeply, head down. 
EGGS Winnie! 
Winnie looks up and spots Eggs standing at the edge of the crowd. Under his arm he is holding an old record album. 
WINNIE Huh? 
EGGS (quietly, to Winnie) Where's Fish? 
WINNIE (sotto voce, quietly to EGGS) Uhh. 
Winnie shrugs, "I don't know" and starts another story. 
WINNIE (CONT'D) (to the audience) And now I will tell the heroic story of the Naked Boxtrolls and the Crusher of DOOOOOOM! 
Winnie gestures to the stage curtain, which moves to reveal Knickers - wearing only his knickers - standing beneath a mock cardboard `1 TON' WEIGHT. 
Eggs walks away from the stage as boxtrolls scramble to get better seats. 
CUT TO: 
The   square is cleaned up from the battle and there are a few new   additions. Eggs spots Oil Can, hard at work lubricating the   cables for the One Man Band's kick drum. Oil Can smiles and   they both move on to REVEAL: 
A tent with a sign for SPARKY'S SCRAP SHACK - a boxtroll appliance repair service - hanging from it. 
SIR LANGSDALE stands next to his toaster as Bucket and Sparky peer inside it. 
SIR LANGSDALE It hasn't worked right in years! 
Boulanger speeds around the repair tent, making rusty squeaks with each wheel rotation. An excited Oil can squeals and chases Boulanger's wheelchair. 
SIR LANGSDALE (CONT'D) I said I like it burnt, then she says well I don't! So here I am.

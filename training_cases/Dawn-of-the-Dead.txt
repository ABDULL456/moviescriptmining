DAWN OF THE DEAD (The working draft 1977) by George A. Romero 
1	We see the face of a young woman. She is asleep. It is very quiet at first, as credits appear. The woman's face begins to twitch, as though she is having a bad dream. She moans slightly and her expression grows more desperate. 
A mix of subtle sounds begin to fade in. As they get louder, we can discern what sounds like a busy office area. It is actually a frantic television studio with the hum of panic in a national emergency. 
The woman's moans get louder and more desperate as the background sounds reach full volume and the credits stop. The woman sits up, snapping awake. 
2	She lurches forwards into the arms of a strong young man. She is Francine, twenty three years old and very attractive, although she is gritty with dirt. Her hair is hanging, dishevelled and sweaty. Her jeans and blouse have been worn for several days. 
She is sitting on the floor, where she has slept the last several hours, covered by an old overcoat. 
Tony:	YOU OK? 
Fran stares at the young man. She is shaking. She doesn't speak. 
Tony:	THE SHIT'S REALLY HITTING THE FAN. 
The girl tries to clear her head as the young man moves on to where others sleep on the floor. He wakes them up one at a time. We begin to hear voices over the busy hum of the studio. They have an electronic tinniness, as broadcast over a monitor. Fran looks about. She is still shaken from her dream. 
3	We see the television studio. Reporters buzz about madly. Everybody looks dishevelled and exhausted. Technicians man monitors, and we see people on the little screens, arguing emotionally. 
4	Voice:	WHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN? WHAT THE HELL DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE, WHAT'S MAKING IT HAPPEN. 
Voice:	YES, BUT THAT'S... 
Voice:	THAT'S A WHOLE OTHER STUDY. THEY'RE TRYING... 
Voice:	BUT IF WE KNEW THAT, WE COULD... 
Voice:	WE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE DON'T KNOW THAT! WE'VE GOTTA OPERATE ON WHAT WE DO KNOW! 
5	The room is pandemonium. People run in with wire copy; others organise the stacks of bulletins as they arrive. Others trip over cables and generally get in each other's way. 
6	Francine stares at the madness, still trying to clear her head. 
Man's voice: I'M STILL DREAMING. 
Fran turns her head. Another young man sits next to her on the floor. He is one of the ones Tony awakened. 
Fran:	NO YOU'RE NOT. 
Woman:	MY TURN WITH THE COAT. 
Fran looks up. A young woman is offering her coffee in a paper cup. She is next in line for the overcoat and a few hours sleep. Fran takes the coffee and struggles to her feet. 
Woman:	THE GUYS ON THE CREW ARE GETTING CRAZY. A BUNCH OF 'EM FLEW THE COOP ALREADY. I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER WE'LL BE ABLE TO STAY ON AIR. 
7	Fran staggers over to the control consoles. The technicians are at the end of their ropes. 
Technicians: (all at once) WATCH CAMERA TWO...WHO THE HELL'S ON CAMERA TWO, A BLIND MAN... WATCH THE FRAME...WATCH THE FRAME... ROLL THE RESCUE STATIONS AGAIN. 
Technicians: WE GOT A REPORT THAT HALF THOSE RESCUE STATIONS HAVE BEEN KNOCKED OUT. SO GET ME A NEW LIST. SURE, I'LL PULL IT OUTA MY ASS. 
Fran focuses on the monitors. She is incredulous... stunned by the madness which surrounds her. She realises the hopelessness of the situation as she zeroes in on the televised conversation. 
8	We begin to listen over the din of the news room. 
TV Man 1:    I DON'T BELIEVE THAT, DOCTOR, AND I DON'T BELIEVE... 
TV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO LIFE? 
TV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO... 
TV Man 2:    DO YOU BELIEVE THE DEAD ARE RETURNING TO LIFE AND ATTACKING THE LIVING? 
TV Man 1:    I'M NOT SO SURE WHAT TO BELIEVE DOCTOR! 
9	Suddenly we cut into the studio, and we see the argument as it is being shot. 
TV Man 1:    (con't) ALL WE GET IS WHAT YOU PEOPLE TELL US. AND IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE... 
TV Man 2:    IT'S FACT... IT'S FACT... 
TV Man 1:    IT'S HARD ENOUGH TO BELIEVE WITHOUT YOU COMING IN HERE AND TELLING US WE HAVE TO FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY AND... 
TV Man 2:    HUMAN DIG... YOU CAN'T... 
TV Man 1:    ...FORGET ALL HUMAN DIGNITY... 
TV Man 2:    YOU'RE NOT RUNNING A TALK SHOW HERE, MR. BERMAN...YOU CAN FORGET PITCHING AN AUDIENCE THE MORAL BULL SHIT THEY WANT TO HEAR! 
TV Man 1:    YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ABANDONING EVERY HUMAN CODE OF BEHAVIOUR, AND THERE'S A LOT OF US WHO AREN'T READY FOR THAT DOCTOR FOSTER... 
19	 Fran moves into the large studio area where the broadcasters argue. The commotion is maddening. Fran stares for a moment. 
20	 TV Man 2:    (now distraught...almost pleading) THIS SITUATION IS CONTROLLABLE. PEOPLE MUST COME TO GRIPS WITH THIS CONCEPT. IT'S EXTREMELY DIFFICULT...WITH FRIENDS... WITH FAMILY...BUT A DEAD BODY MUST BE DE- ACTIVATED BY EITHER DESTROYING THE BRAIN OR SEVERING THE BRAIN FROM THE REST OF THE BODY. 
Another outburst in the studio. 
TV Man 2:    THE SITUATION MUST BE CONTROLLED...BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE...THEY ARE MULTIPLYING TOO RAPIDLY... 
21	 Fran moves through the crowded room of emotional people and finally reaches another emergency radio installation. Skip and Dusty are trying to listen to their receivers. They jot notes. 
Fran:	OPERATIVE RESCUE STATIONS? 
Dusty:	THEY'RE DROPPIN' LIKE FLIES. HERE'S A FEW. YOU KNOW, I THINK FOSTER'S RIGHT. I THINK WE'RE LOSIN' THIS WAR. 
Fran:	YEAH, BUT NOT TO THE ENEMY. WE'RE BLOWIN' IT OURSELVES. 
She gives the rest of her coffee to the two men. 
Fran:	NOT MUCH LEFT, BUT HAVE A BALL. 
The two men each slug eagerly from the paper cup. Fran rushes off toward a large teleprompter typing machine. 
22	 The broadcasters still argue emotionally. 
TV Man 1:    PEOPLE AREN'T WILLING TO ACCEPT YOUR SOLUTIONS, DOCTOR, AND I, FOR ONE, DON'T BLAME THEM. 
TV Man 2:    EVERY DEAD BODY THAT IS NOT EXTERMINATED BECOMES ONE OF THEM! IT GETS UP AND KILLS! THE PEOPLE IT KILLS GET UP AND KILL! 
23	 Handing the list of active rescue stations to the teleprompter typist, Fran rushes back toward the control room. 
24	 Around the monitor consoles, the commotion has been made even more frantic by an angered Dan Givens, obviously one of the station managers. 
Givens:	 NOBODY HAS THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT, I WANT... 
Givens spots Fran as she moves into the room. 
Givens:	 GARRET, WHO TOLD YOU TO KILL THE SUPERS? 
Fran:	NOBODY. I KILLED 'EM. THEY'RE OUT OF DATE. 
Givens:	 I WANT THOSE SUPERS ON THE AIR ALL THE TIME. 
Fran:	ARE YOU WILLING TO MURDER PEOPLE BY SENDING THEM OUT TO STATIONS THAT HAVE CLOSED DOWN? 
Givens:	 WITHOUT THOSE RESCUE STATIONS ON SCREEN EVERY MINUTE PEOPLE WON'T WATCH US. THEY'LL TUNE OUT. 
Fran stares at the red faced man in disbelief. 
Givens:	 I WANT THAT LIST UP ON THE SCREEN EVERY MINUTE THAT WE'RE ON THE AIR. 
Fran is about to say something in anger, but before she can, one of the technicians, having overheard Givens, gets up from the control panel and starts to walk away. 
Givens:	 LUCAS...LUCAS, WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING... GET ON THAT CONSOLE...LUCAS...WE'RE ON THE AIR! 
Lucas:	ANYBODY NEED A RIDE! 
25	 Two other men from various positions in the room snatch up personal effects and follow the technician toward the door. The door is guarded by a nervous Officer. 
26	 Givens:	 OFFICER...OFFICER...YOU STOP THEM...STOP THOSE MEN...LUCAS...GET BACK ON THIS CONSOLE... 
A frantic hubbub begins over the lack of console control. People rush in and out, the floor director's voice can be heard over a talk back system... 
Voices:	 WHAT THE HELL'S GOIN' ON IN THERE. SWITCH...SWITCH...THERE'S NO SWITCHER... WE'RE LOSING PICTURE... 
Givens:	 OFFICER...STOP THOSE MEN... 27	 The young officer faces the men as they reach his post. He takes a grip on his rifles, opens the door and lets the group through. Then he runs out himself, deserting the losing cause. 
28	 Givens jumps toward the console. He frantically tries to work the complex dials and pots... 
Givens:	 GET SOMEBODY IN HERE THAT KNOWS HOW TO RUN THIS THING...COME ON...I'LL TRIPLE THE MONEY FOR THE MAN THAT CAN RUN THIS THING...TRIPLE THE MONEY...WE'RE STAYING ON THE AIR... 
Fran moves slowly off toward the studio. 
29	 In the big room, the tension is thicker than ever. A few of the newsmen still earnestly try to perform their various functions, but most of the crew are reduced to emotional polarisation over the broadcast which still rages. 
30	 TV Man 2:    THEY KILL FOR ONE REASON. THEY KILL FOR FOOD. THEY EAT THEIR VICTIMS, DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, MR. BERMAN. THAT'S WHAT KEEPS THEM GOING. 
31	 Fran stops to listen to the argument. She falls back into the shadows of the studio. People rush past her, some leaving the studio in disgust. 
32	 TV Man 2:    IF WE'D LISTENED...IF WE'D DEALT WITH THE PHENOMENON PROPERLY...WITHOUT EMOTION... WITHOUT...EMOTION... IT WOULDN'T HAVE COME TO THIS! 
Foster wipes his sweat with a dirty hanker chief. He pulls his tie away from his tight collar, and pops the shirt button open. He is desperate now, shivering with anger and frustration. 
TV Man 2:    THERE IS A MARTIAL LAW STATE IN EFFECT IN PHILADELPHIA...AS IN ALL OTHER MAJOR CITIES IN THE COUNTRY... CITIZENS MUST UNDERSTAND THE...DIRE...DIRE CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PHENOMENON...SHOULD WE BE UNABLE TO CHECK THE SPREAD... BECAUSE OF THE EMOTIONAL ATTITUDES..OF THE CITIZENRY...TOWARD...THESE ISSUES OF... MORALITY... IT IS THE ORDER OF THE O.E.P. BY COMMAND OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT...THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES... CITIZENS MAY NO LONGER OCCUPY PRIVATE RESIDENCES, NO MATTER HOW SAFELY PROTECTED OR WELL STOCKED... 
Roger:	KEEP COOL. JUST DON'T POP OFF IN THERE WHEN WE GO IN. 
The boy nods, grateful for a more human contact. 
Wooley:	 HOW THE HELL COME WE STICK THESE LOW LIFES IN THESE BIG ASS FANCY HOTELS ANYWAY? SHIT MAN. THIS' BETTER THAN I GOT. YOU AIN'T GONNA TALK 'EM OUTA HERE. YOU GOTTA BLOW 'EM OUT. BLOW THEIR ASSES! 
Roger:	(to the boy) YOU GONNA BE ALRIGHT? 
The boy nods in the affirmative. 
Wooley:	 LET'S GET ON WITH IT. THIS IS A WASTE OF MY TIME! 
44	 CRASH! Without warning, the metal door to the fire stair bursts open and several figures rush out of the darkness. Shots are fired from hand guns. A bullet smashes through the skull of the young boy next to Roger. He falls against Roger with a pleading expression on his face. 
Figures charge this way and that. More gunfire. The other S.W.A.T. men dodge and dive for cover. Wooley opens fire with his automatic weapon. 
45	 On the street, the Commander, hearing the gunfire, barks into the bullhorn: 
Commander:   MOVE IN...MOVE IN... GODDAMMIT! 
Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie) ALL UNITS... FULL OPERATION! 
46	 On the roof, Roger struggles under the dead weight of the young man. He tries to free himself and his weapons. Shots ring out. 
A handful of Black and Puerto Rican youngsters charge about the rooftop. Another S.W.A.T. patrol appears from behind a large elevator housing. The young civilians retreat. Several are mowed down. 
Another bullet smashes against the dead S.W.A.T. man's back. Just as Roger frees himself, a bullet catches him squarely in the chest, but his armour takes the impact. He is thrown back off balance, and he struggles to catch his wind as he scrambles over to recover his weapon which skitters away across the roof top. 
Before he reaches the gun, he is cut off by the looming figure of one of the Black youths, pistol in hand. Roger freezes. The young man aims his hand gun, but hesitates. A sudden barrage of bullets rips through the young Black and he falls in a pool of blood. It was Wooley's gun that killed him. 
Wooley:	 COME ON YOU DUMB BASTARDS... COME AND GET 'EM... 
He fires again and again, even though the skirmish is winding down. 
Roger charges for his weapon, snatches it up, and runs for the cover of an incinerator housing. He startles a young civilian who was hiding there, trying to load his gun. The boy makes a break... 
Roger:	HOLD IT... 
The boy freezes for a moment, then, thinking, breaks into a run across the roof. 
Roger:	HOLD IT, KID...DON'T RUN OUT THERE! 
The boy is mowed down in a crossfire. 
47	 Inside the building, other S.W.A.T. teams along with units of the National Guard are crashing through hallways and breaking into apartment units. People are herded into the halls where they are held at gun point. 
Some men, although armed, surrender willingly. Others retaliate against the invading force, and little skirmishes develop on every floor of the complex structure. 
48	 On the ground, the Commander barks into the bullhorn: 
Commander:   MASKS... 
Sergeant:    (into walkie talkie) MASKS FOR GAS...MASKS FOR GAS. 
49	 Tear gas canisters crash through windows and the halls are filled with clouds of gas. Civilians trying to escape, are choked as they attempt to shoot their way out. 
50	 The teams on the roof charge down the fire stairs into the building. 
S.W.A.T. 1:  WORK YOUR WAY DOWN. A FLOOR AT A TIME. HOLD 'EM IN THE HALLS 'TIL WE CAN WORK 'EM DOWN THE STAIRS. 
Roger and Wooley and the men in their unit, snap on their bizarre looking gas masks. 
51	 The troopers break into an apartment on the floor. An old couple kneels in prayer at a small alter, while their children and their children's children huddle in a corner. The young husband surrenders his gun to a trooper, and Roger watches as the group is led into the hallway. 
Suddenly, a young Black man charges out of one of the apartments. A woman appears at the door, screaming for him to stop. He breaks through a cloud of gas and Wooley fires his automatic. The black man crashes to the floor. Wooley is crazed. He kicks in the door of another apartment and fires randomly into the room. 
The flurry of action causes panic among the civilians in the hall. The younger ones try to escape while the older people kneel or fall against the walls praying. 
S.W.A.T. 2:  WOOLEY'S GONE APE SHIT, MAN... 
Roger:	WOOLEY! (shouting) 
Wooley kicks in the door of another apartment. Roger charges at him and grabs him around the shoulders. The big man resists. His gun fires and bullets fly wildly. He struggles against Roger, but Roger manages to hold on. 
Roger:	GIMME A HAND...SOMEBODY... 
Another S.W.A.T. Trooper steps up out of the cloud of gas. He is very tall and he looks mysterious in the fog as he speaks in a deep voice. 
Trooper:	STEP AWAY FROM HIM. 
Roger:	GIMME A HAND. 
Wooley throws his body around and slams Roger against the wall, but Roger grabs him again just as the crazed man is levelling off his gun at the open apartment door. 
He pulls her quickly along. They have to actually step over the civilian corpse. Fran freezes again. She can't bring herself to walk over the body. Steve lets go of her hand and checking the tank gauge, he pulls the hose with him as he moves quickly back to Fran. The long hose is heavy, and it bobbles the civilian corpse, almost rolling it over. The back of the bodies head has been blown out by the exit wound of a powerful bullet. Blood still runs. The wound is fresh. Steve does not see this as he tugs the hose over the corpse and moves to the helicopter with Fran following. 
71	 At the side of the machine, the blades still spinning overhead, Steve jams the hose nozzle into the fuel tank receptacle. He pulls one of Fran's hands into the nozzle mechanism. 
Steve:	JUST LIKE THIS...LIKE A CAR... 
Fran responds, getting the feel of the nozzle trigger. 
Steve:	THAT'S IT...JUST HOLD HER THERE 'TIL SHE SPITS OUT AT YA. 
The woman takes over and Stephen trots away toward the guard shed. The propeller blades still spin. They make an eerie, whispering sound as they pass over Fran's head. She can hear the lapping water now, and the creaking moans of the shifting docks. She looks this way and that, fear in her eyes. 
72	 At the guard house, Stephen rushes in to find the dead radio operator. A signal is coming over the receiver in Morse Code. The corpse is slumped over the desk and it is covering the send key. A small entry wound is barely visible in the back of the dead man's head. As Stephen pulls the body up to an erect posture in its chair, he sees that the exit of the bullet all but obliterated the corpse's face. Again the wound is still running and bits of flesh and blood are splattered about the desk and the radio unit. 
Stephen clicks on the send switch and he quickly begins to send a message in Morse: 
OPERATOR DEAD...POST ABANDONED... 
73	 Back on the fuel dock, the long hose brushes over the civilian corpse. A shadow moves nearby, making is aware of a presence other than Fran's. 
74	 The woman switches hands on the pump nozzle. The blades still whoosh overhead. Then she hears the sound of another engine. She looks towards the mainland. The headlights of an approaching vehicle can be seen. 
75	 At the guard house, Stephen, hearing the approaching engine, steps into the doorway and looks up the dock. He calls to Fran. 
Steve:	I HOPE IT'S ROGER. 
76	 Fran:	WHAT ARE YOU DOING? 
Steve:	I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. 
77	 He ducks back into the shed. He snatches up a First Aid Kit and throws it into a khaki knapsack. He rummages in the darkness. He finds a toolbox. 
As he stands up, he backs into a tall figure which stands in the shadows. Feeling something sharp and hard against his back. Steve recoils and spins to face the figure. It is a uniformed officer. His rifle is levelled off at Steve's chest. From out of the shadows, a second Policeman appears with a hand gun cocked and aimed. 
78	 Fran's eyes strain to discern the approaching vehicle, but suddenly she catches a movement in the corner of her vision. Through the open sides of the helicopter bubble, she notices a Police van. It has been there all along, it's doors flung wide open, as though abandoned hurriedly. Now one of the rear doors move. A figure appears carrying a large packing carton. The figure is uniformed, with two rifles strapped to its back. It rushes toward the launch docks. 
Voice:	JUST STAY COOL. 
Fran, already startled by the running figure, is now doubly shocked by the calm voice behind her. She spins and the fuel nozzle clatters out of it's receptacle to the wooden dock boards. She is facing another "Policeman", to aims a rifle directly at her head. 
Officer 1:   IF YOU DIE...IT'LL BE YOUR OWN FAULT. 
The Officer who is running with the carton shouts toward the Guard House. 
Officer 2:   COME ON SKIPPER...THEY GOT FRIENDS COMIN'. 
79	 In the Guard House, Steve is held at bay by one of the Officers while the other uniformed man moves to the door to check the progress of the approaching vehicles. 
Officer 3:   WHO ARE YOU? 
Steve:	WE'RE WITH J.A.S...WE... 
Officer 4:   (at the door) ABOUT A MINUTE AND A HALF. (referring to the arrival time of the vehicle) 
Officer 3, the Skipper, pushes Steve with his gun barrel. Steve spins out through the open doorway. He looks up the dock and sees the vehicle which is just turning onto the pier which is almost a mile long. 
80	 Officer 1 has moved around Fran and he reaches into the helicopter bubble pulling out Steve's rifle. 
81	 Steve:	NOW WAIT A MINUTE...WE'RE JUST HERE TO REFUEL... THESE MEN WERE ALREADY DEAD...YOU WERE HERE... YOU KNOW THAT...IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY WAS AFTER THE LAUNCHES...WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH... 
Officer 3:   (looking at the insignia on the helicopter) HEY...J.A.S. TRAFFIC WATCH... STEVE ANDREWS. 
Steve:	(trying to capitalise on his minor celebrity power) RIGHT...THAT'S ME...I'M STEVE ANDREW... 
Officer 3:   NO SHIT. 
82	 Officer 1:   (shouting from the helicopter) WE'D GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD, SKIPPER. 
83	 Steve freezes again, sensing that these are not law enforcers. 
84	 The man who was carrying the carton is now rushing back up the dock having deposited his load in one of the motor launches. 
Officer 2:   CAN'T ALL FIT. 
85	 Officer 3:   (directly to Stephen) HOW MANY WILL THAT THING HOLD? 
Officer 4:   HEY, MAN, I AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE IN NOTHIN' I CAN'T DRIVER MYSELF! 
86	 Officer 2 has returned to the van and is carrying out another carton rushing back to the launch. 
Officer 2:   THAT'S TRUE...SOMETHIN' HAPPENS TO HIM AND WE'RE STUCK. STAY WITH THE LAUNCH! 
Officer 1:   GET A LOT FURTHER IN THIS BIRD! 
Steve:	WHERE YA HEADED? 
Officer 2:   DOWN RIVER...GOT AN IDEA MAYBE WE CAN MAKE IT TO THE ISLANDS. 
Steve:	WHAT ISLANDS? (he starts the engine) 
Officer 2:   ANY ISLANDS...WHAT ABOUT YOU? WHERE YOU HEADED? 
Steve:	STRAIGHT UP. 
106	The Policeman rushes off with his two cohorts. As they untie one of the launches from the dock, the J.A.S. helicopter whines loudly. Then it lifts off the dock with a smooth motion. 
The Police launch starts without a problem, and it pulls out onto the dark river. 
107	The lights on the helicopter blink as the metal bird swoops low over the Philadelphia skyline. We see an empty city. Independence Hall...Betsy Ross' House, which flies the original American flag...the oldest American heritages stand coldly in the night. The whirring engine fades overhead. 
108	In the cockpit, Fran lights a cigarette. So does Roger. No one comments, but Peter smiles slightly. 
The big Black looks down at the city. 
Peter:	ANY OF YOU LEAVIN' PEOPLE BEHIND? 
Fran:	AN EX-HUSBAND. 
Roger:	AN EX-WIFE. 
Steve:	YOU PETER? 
Peter:	(still looking down) SOME BROTHERS. 
109	The whirlybird cuts through the dark night sky. It flies over open country now, moving West. Some time has passed. 
110	Roger is asleep in the passenger seat. Twisted in the cramped rear of the cockpit, Fran and Peter sit very close to each other. Peter still stares off into the night. 
Fran:	REAL BROTHERS? 
Peter looks at her. He has a strong face. 
Fran:	REAL BROTHERS OR...STREET BROTHERS? 
Peter:	BOTH. 
Fran:	HOW MANY REAL ONES? 
Peter:	TWO. 
Fran:	TWO. 
Peter:	ONE'S IN JAIL. THE OTHER'S A PRO BALL PLAYER. BUT WE CATCH UP TO EACH OTHER ONCE IN A WHILE. 
Fran doesn't quite know how to respond. 
Peter:	(nodding at Steve...the engine roars too loudly for the pilot to hear the conversation) HE YOUR MAN NOW? 
Fran is taken off guard. She smiles slightly. 
Fran:	MOST OF THE TIME, YEAH. 
Peter:	JUST LIKE TO KNOW WHO EVERYONE IS. 
Fran:	YEAH. ME TOO. 
111	Light downs on the horizon. The little helicopter chugs through the shades of blue. 
112	Now Fran is asleep and Roger still snores. Peter stares at the back of the pilot's head. Steve nods slightly, then shakes himself. Soon, he nods again...falling asleep. Peter kicks him in the shoulder. 
Steve looks back, surprised that the big man is awake. Peter just stares at him. 
Steve rubs his face violently with his free hand. He pulls at his lower eyelids. 
Steve:	ANY MORE WATER? 
Peter reaches into the supplies and produces a plastic container with water. Steve slugs some of it and pours a little onto his face. Then he passes it back to Peter, who also drinks. 
Suddenly, Fran stiffens and wakes up with a start. Peter looks over at her with a gentle expression. She takes a moment to orient herself. 
Peter:	(to Stephen) YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE? 
Steve:	I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE WE ARE. 
Peter:	HARRISBURG? 
Steve:	PASSED IT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO. 
167	Fran:	(still staring down through a bubble) WHAT ARE THEY DOING? WHY DO THEY COME HERE? 
Steve:	(also looking down) SOME KIND OF INSTINCT. MEMORY...OF WHAT THEY USED TO DO. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT PLACE IN THEIR LIVES. 
168	Below, the Zombies which are in sight wander aimlessly over the plaza. Some try the gates but cannot budge them. One wanders out of the single open shop, it is a female. The shop is an appliance store. As the creature leaves she drags a toaster idly behind her, pulling it by its power cable. It scrapes on the floor loudly. 
169	We see an installation of large reflectors mounted in an intricate metal skeleton which stretches across a large area of the roof surface.  Behind the structures can be seen a large power generator. 
170	Peter:	SOLAR SCREENS. 
Roger:	CAN'T BE ENOUGH TO POWER THIS PLACE. 
Peter:	EMERGENCY SYSTEM, MAYBE. 
Roger:	IT'S PRETTY LIT UP IN THERE. 
Peter:	GUESS THE POWER'S NOT OFF IN THIS AREA. A LOT OF PHILLY'S STILL LIT. COULD BE NUCLEAR. 
171	Roger:	HEY LOOK AT THIS! 
Roger is peering down through a wire-hatched skylight. There are several laid out over this particular area of the roof. He moves to another while Peter looks down into the first. Fran and Stephen jog up. 
Roger:	THESE DON'T GO DOWN INTO THE MALL. WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? 
Fran and Stephen peer down into the darkness. Peter pulls a flashlight from his utility belt.  He has stayed in full uniform all the while, where Roger has stripped off all but his ammunition belt and pistol holster. 
172	The big man shines a light beam down into the space. The floor is only seven feet or so below the window. There is absolutely nothing in sight; clear floor, clear walls, all light grey. 
Peter:	DAMN. 
173	Roger has moved to another window. 
Roger:	HEY, OVER HERE. THERE'S SOMETHIN' HERE. 
174	Peter trots over and shines his beam down. They see a vast array of cardboard cartons...hundreds of them. 
Roger:	STORAGE? 
175	Peter moves the light beam. Now it illuminates a collection of large drums, stacked floor to ceiling and running deep past the line of vision. On the face of each drum is the familiar symbol of a triangle within a circle, and the letters C.D. 
176	Peter:	CIVIL DEFENCE. CIVIL DEFENCE WATER SUPPLY. 
Roger:	AND BOXES OF CANNED FOOD! 
Steve:	HOW DO WE GET DOWN THERE? 
Peter looks at Stephen as a street-wise-tough would look at a hopeless city-slick-sissy. Then the big man brings his rifle butt down against the glass and the shattered pane crashes to the floor below. 
177	Inside - the vast space is impressive. It is quite dark but for rays of sunlight which drift through the occasional skylights. We see an enormous quantity of food cartons and water drums, it is very quiet. The space is barren except for the stacks of Civil Defence supplies. 
178	Suddenly, a figure drops out of one of the skylights, landing on its feet in the sunray. It is Peter.	Instantly he readies his rifle, looking this way and that across the large room. Silence. 
Peter:	OK. 
He steps aside and Roger climbs in. He too drops cat-like to the floor.179	The two men instantly sling their rifles and move to the food cartons as by pre-arranged plan. They carry the big boxes quickly, one at a time, to the spot under the open skylight.	In a moment, they have built a pyramid out of the cartons. It creates a kind of stairway for a quick escape through the window above. 
180	Now Fran lowers herself into the room and is able to climb down the cartons holding onto Roger's hand. She is followed by an anxious Stephen.181	Peter has already wandered off. There are only two doors in the enormous room, one at either end. The big Trooper moves up to one of them as Roger comes up behind him, gun ready.	Peter's hand turns the doorknob. It is unlocked, and the big man gives Roger a familiar nod. Roger stands several feet back, his rifle aimed directly at the door and ready to fire. Then, with a sudden, commando-like motion. Peter throws the door open and ducks away flat against the wall. Roger stiffens, his finger all but pulling his trigger, but there is no apparent danger. 
182	The door opens onto another vast room, equivalent to the one the people are in. It also has stacks of C.D. supplies. 
The Troopers cautiously move into the area through the door. The room is empty. The same sunrays pierce the darkness through skylights. All is dead quiet. This room has no doors at all, but for the one Peter opened. Roger:	DOUBLE DAMN! LOOKS LIKE A FREE LUNCH, BUDDY.183	In the first room Stephen has started to rip open one of the cartons. 
Fran:	SPAM! 
Roger walks back into the room. Roger:	YOU BRING A CAN OPENER? 
Fran:	OH. 
Roger:	THEN DON'T KNOCK SPAM. IT'S GOT IT'S OWN KEY. 
The woman flips over the can in her hand and finds the little key. 
Peter has walked right past the group.  He is moving quickly toward the still-unknown door at the other end of the room. Again, Roger follows. 
184	At the door, the two Troopers go through the same S.W.A.T. procedure. The door swings open, this time onto a very small space. Again no immediate danger. 
185	As the men enter, they discover that they are on the top landing of a concrete and metal firestair. There are no windows, and the air is musty. There is one bare light bulb lit in the ceiling, but down the stairs at the next landing it is quite dark, and there the stairs wind even further down; they recede into blackness. 
Roger:	WHATD'YA THINK? 
The Black man just stares, first down into the darkness then back into the storage area. 
Roger:	THIS IS THE ONLY WAY UP HERE. WHATD'YA THINK? CUT. 
Steve:	JESUS CHRIST... THEY'RE MANIACS. 
221	The Troopers step over the corpse. The second Zombie, the arm less female, is walking toward them. This time Roger fires his weapon. The creature falls in a heap.	Roger:	WHATD'YA THINK? BAG IT OR TRY FOR IT? Peter:	YOU GAME?	Roger nods and the two men run down the hall toward the mall.	Their rifles poised, they are like commandos on an important mission. 
The men at the mall mouth see the department store and start for it. They run from the corridor onto the balcony.222	The battle to win the mall has begun. The creatures which wander the first floor look about, attracted by the sound, but they are confused. They walk this way and that, in mis-guided staggering strides.223	Several of the Zombies try to move up the down-escalator. They fall over themselves and cannot negotiate the moving stairway.224	A few creatures who move onto the up-escalator also fall against each other from the movement, but one falls onto the moving steps and is carried upward. Then another manages to keep its balance holding on to the hand rail. 225	At another point down the length of the mall, there is a stationary stairway which runs from the first to the second	floor. Several creatures move up the steps. 
226	At the top of the firestair, Stephen begins to move down the steps cautiously. His rifle is at the ready. Fran stays on the top landing.	Fran:	STEPHEN, DON'T GO DOWN THERE.			(he continues) STEPHEN PLEASE! 
Steve:	IT'S ALRIGHT. 
227	At the huge gate which locks off the big Department Store, the two Troopers come to a crashing stop. 
228	There is a side concourse which can be seen from this vantage point, and in the hall are four or five Zombies. They are about three hundred feet away. 
229	Roger keeps his rifle levelled off in the direction of the creatures while Peter confronts the lock at the middle of the big roll gate.	He fumbles with the keys for a moment until he finally sinks	the proper key into the receptacle which is right at the floor.	The tumblers turn successfully.	Peter:	ALRIGHT! 
230	On the escalator, the creatures which fell onto the moving steps are being carried up to the balcony. The one supporting himself on the hand rail is still standing. The head of the standing Zombie suddenly becomes visible from Roger's perspective. 
231	The Trooper raises his gun and aims for the creature's forehead. 
Peter tries to life the roll gate. It won't move. It is still locked.	Peter:	YOU BASTARD! Roger:	WHAT? 
Peter:	STILL LOCKED...(he sees another assembly) ON THE SIDE... 
The big man moves to the far side of the gate. The same key fits. Roger re-focuses on the creature which is riding the escalator. It is quite near the top now. Roger is about to shoot when something catches his eye. 
232	The fallen Zombies, which up to now could not be seen behind the	escalator rail wall, suddenly come tumbling out onto the balcony floor.233	Roger fires, but his aim is inaccurate.234	He hits the standing Zombie in the neck. The creature is thrown	off balance enough to lose its footing. It falls back down the escalator, but before it reaches the bottom, it stops rolling. The steps carry it back up toward the second floor again. It is still very much alive. The two creatures on the balcony struggle to stand.235	Roger looks back over his shoulder.236	The Zombies from the side concourse are now about a hundred and fifty feet away. 
237	Peter turns the key in the lock, but again the gate will not lift. It moves slightly, as the middle mechanism and the one on the far right are free, but there is a third lock on the far left. Peter moves to it quickly.238	On the first floor concourse, other creatures are beginning to	take note of the action upstairs. They start to move.239	The Zombies on the stationary stairway are beginning to reach the second floor, but they are far down the main balcony. They will have to pass the administrative corridor in order to reach the Department Store. 
240	Roger fires again. 
241	One of the nearby Zombies falls in a heap. 
242	At the sound of the rifle, Fran gets desperate. 
Fran:	STEPHEN...FOR GOD'S SAKE...LET'S GET UP ON THE ROOF...243	Steve is at the middle landing. He stares down into the darkness below. More gunfire can be heard from the mall. 
Steve:	IT'S ALRIGHT, I'M TELLIN 'YA. THOSE THINGS			DON'T MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO CATCH US.	More gunfire can be heard.244	Now the giant gate rolls up with a loud rumble. Peter ducks into the store even as the gate is still rising, but the inertia of the great metal cage carries the lip up out of Peter's grasp. He jumps to try to catch it, but he misses. It jerks up into its fully open position and rolls back down slightly, but still Peter cannot reach the lip. It slides back to rest about three feet above Peter's fingertips.245	The Zombies advance.246	Roger drops another with a clean shot through the head, then he backs into the archway of the Department Store entrance. Peter is desperately looking around for something to stand on to reach the gate.247	The Zombies are very close to the arch now, advancing steadily. 
248	Peter grabs a small counter used to display shoes, but it is too heavy for him to move himself. 
Peter:	HERE...COME ON... 
Roger has to abandon his post at the arch long enough to help drag the little counter. The men drag it to a point just at the side of the open arch, and Peter instantly jumps up on the top of it. At that instant, a Zombie rounds the corner and grabs at Peter's legs. The big man kicks, startled, and the motion causes him to fall off the little counter. He lands on his feet, but out on the balcony beyond the arch. Roger brings his rifle butt around against the creature's head and the Zombie falls back, but is not dead. 
Other creatures are only a few feet from Peter, whose gun sits on the little counter inside the store. Roger levels off his rifle but cannot fire as Peter is in the line. Peter makes a move and, like a football player, jukes to the left, then to the right. He dives right at one of the creatures carrying it into the store.	Now Roger fires, dropping one, then another. Peter jumps back up	on the counter.	Peter:	BEHIND YOU...BEHIND YOU... 
The creature in the store has crashed against a cosmetics display and is regaining its footing. Roger turns and fires. The	creature falls. Peter grabs the lip of the roll gate and starts to bring it down. 
There are several creatures right in the archway, now they clutch with their hands. One blocks the downward progress of the	gate. Roger fires point blank and the Zombie flies back. The gate lowers but is stopped by the clutching hands of other creatures. Roger grabs the cage now and helps to pull it down. Peter, still gripping the lip, jumps off the counter to get more leverage.	The bottom of the gate is now four feet from the floor. The two men are able to move it steadily downward. The Zombies are very weak, but more creatures appear making it more difficult. Then one Zombie tries to crawl under the gate. Its torso just gets through as the gate slams down against its chest. Its arms grab for Peter's legs and its mouth is gasping. Its body is preventing the gate from engaging in the floor mechanisms.	Roger lets go the cage as Peter tries to hold it against the creatures outside. Grabbing his rifle, Roger brings the butt straight down on the clutching Zombie's skull. The Zombie goes limp. Then Roger tries to push the creature clear of the gate, but the pressure is too great. Roger:	LET UP A LITTLE...LET UP A LITTLE... 
The gate rises a few inches. More Zombies appear outside. Their hands clutch at the roll gate. The openings in the grid are only big enough for their fingers, their hands can't reach through, but they are pushing the gate higher and higher...more than Peter intended to clear the obstructing corpse.	With his rifle butt, Roger manages to push the dead Zombie clear except for one of its arms. From outside, a creature's hand suddenly grabs Roger's weapon. For a moment its like a Tug-O-War. Peter is having a harder time holding the gate. It is inching upward.	Peter:	COME ON...COME ON...	Roger lets go his gun barrel and the weapon is snatched away by the creature in the crowd. Roger grabs for the gate.	Peter:	THE ARM...THAT ARM'S IN THE WAY.	Roger squats again and manages to throw the dead Zombie's arm	clear. Then he grabs the gate again. Now it starts to move down more steadily.	At the last moment, another clutching arm juts into the store, but when the gate hits it, it withdraws, and the big cage clicks solidly into place. 
The two Troopers step back from the gate. The creatures still moan and gurgle, slamming against the gate, their fingers clutching at the grid, but they are unable to budge it. There are ten or twelve Zombies trying to get into the Department Store and several others are making their way along the balcony. At least six lie dead along the floor.	Roger:	WELL...WE'RE IN...NOW, HOW THE HELL WE GONNA			GET BACK?	Peter:	LET'S GO SHOPPIN' FIRST. 
The two men back into the aisles of the store. The creatures outside still push and claw at the gate. The one with Roger's rifle uses it as a bludgeon, but it has no effect. 
249	Stephen opens the door into the Administration corridor. 
250	From his perspective, the hall is inactive. He observes the washrooms and the long row of doors to the various offices. 
251	He starts into the corridor, letting the firestair door close. 
252	At the top of the firestair, Fran can see the beam of light from the open door below. As the door closes, the beam narrows, then it blinks out with a click as the door closes.	Fran:	STEPHEN...JESUS GOD... 
She is very frightened.  She backs into the storage area.253	She moves quickly to the pyramid of cartons which lead to the	roof. She sits on the bottom carton biting her fingers.254	In the Department Store, Roger is riding down an escalator. He has found a back pack, and it is obviously already filled with goods. As he steps off the moving stairs on the ground floor, the surroundings are eerily quiet.255	He moves through a clothing department. We see the dead looking faces of store mannequins. Roger runs into one and is greatly startled. He snatches up a lined windbreaker and ties it around his waist by its arms, then he trots off down another aisle, where he finds Peter. 
256	The big Trooper has a radio under his arm and he is snatching up a small television. 
Roger:	HEY MAN, WE CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS SHIT... 
257	Peter turns a corner and dumps the articles into something which we cannot yet see. As Roger trots up, he sees that Peter has a big gardening cart already heaped with goods. Roger:	OH...WE'RE GONNA JUST WHEEL RIGHT BY 'EM, RIGHT?	Peter:	WE GONNA TRY, BROTHER. WE AIN'T DOIN' THIS FOR THE EXERCISE. WE MIGHT AS WELL TRY TO GET WHAT WE CAN. 
Roger:	THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN... 
Even though he doesn't understand the plan, Roger helps Peter toss things into the barrow. 
258	They race down the hardware aisle tossing in tools and other supplies. Electrical cables, flashlights, batteries. They scoop things up like contestants on a game-show who have five minutes in a store to grab whatever they can.259	Stephen is in the Maintenance office. He examines the maps and	electrical equipment, then rummages through a desk.260	At the open end of the corridor leading to the second storey balcony, Zombies wander past as they head for the Store entrance where many creature still claw at the roll gate.261	The Zombies move randomly. Some are leaving the gate as their	prey is now out of sight. They begin to wander here and there. 
262	Three of the creatures turn into the administrative corridor and start toward the offices. 
263	Stephen has found a large binder in the desk. It contains all the plans for the mall, duplicating the charts on the walls and many others. It is a complete maintenance manual revealing all the workings and layout of the huge structure.264	Elevator doors slide open with a loud whoosh. The two Troopers appear in the car, wheeling their barrow out onto the second storey aisles of the big store.265	Now, they can see the roll gate and the creatures pushing at it ineffectively. They roll their barrow very close to the gate. When the Zombies catch sight of the humans, their efforts are renewed. They moan and push harder at the gate.266	They Troopers leave the barrow, disappearing back to the aisles.	They run onto the interior escalator, bounding down faster than the moving steps, then they run across the first floor until they see the lower level-roll gate.267	There are creatures wandering the concourse, but none of them	are at the gate.	Peter:	LET'S GO BROTHER...THE OLD OKEY DOKE! 
Roger:	CAN'T TELL. 
Peter:	COME ON. OPEN UP. 
Roger :	 MAYBE WE SHOULD SEE WHAT'S HAPPENIN'... 
Peter:	OPEN UP. I CAN GET THE WAGON OVER. IF IT IS FLYBOY, LET'S GET HIM ON OUR SIDE. 
Roger moves to the second lock. More gunfire. 
Peter:	(setting his weapon on the floor) YOU JUST COVER ME GOOD, YOU HEAR? 
Roger moves to the third lock as Peter stands and grabs on to the handles of the barrow. 
301	The body of a dead Zombie hits the floor, its head shot through. Nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break into the Maintenance Office. 
The third staggers into the room. Stephen stands fast now. He holds his rifle out in front of him. The creature walks toward the gun. Steve holds his hands on the trigger. The Zombie lunges suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. Steve fires, but the blast tears through the creature's chest. Steve struggles to raise the barrel but the motion of the Zombie makes it impossible to aim accurately. The gun fires again, this time grazing the Zombie's neck. With a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the gun free. Steve backs against the wall. The creature tosses the rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. The Zombie advances on Steve. Steve is next to the key cabinet and grabs at it, trying to find some weapon. He feels the tools in the cabinet and comes up with a hammer. The Zombie is about to reach him when Steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the cabinet. The Zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but doesn't fall. Steve tries to hit the creature's head with the tool, he misses and the Zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite it. Steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor. The creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like an animal. Steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow squarely in the creatures face. The Zombie comes after him again and from his crawling position, Steve brings the hammer as an uppercut to the creature's jaw. The creature falls back enough for Steve to crawl across the floor. It follows, but Steve reaches the desk and grabs his rifle. Rolling on the floor, he fires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it. 
302	The second floor gate rolls up with a rumble and Peter runs out of the Department Store with the barrow full of supplies. 
303	The action attracts the attention of several of the creatures which are still wandering the balcony. They turn slowly. 
304	Just as he rounds the corner. Peter almost collides with one creature, and can barely keep from upsetting the barrow. He manages to get past, and he runs as fast as he can toward the opening of the Administrative corridor. 
305	Roger does not let the gate roll up too high. He stabilises the metal grid well within reach, then he stands his post with Peter's rifle. Several creatures approach from the opposite direction. Roger fires at the closest one. It falls. The others are still too far away to waste bullets. 
306	Stephen steps over the corpses in the office and grabs the maintenance manual. He rushes into the corridor and runs out. 
307	Three more creatures move toward him up the hallway. 
308	At first Stephen freezes, then he starts backing toward the firestair, his rifle poised. 
309	Just as Peter is reaching the mouth of the corridor, a Zombie	steps out of the hallway into his path. Peter slams the barrow squarely into the creature's legs. The Zombie falls in the barrow onto the supplies. The big man slams the load against a wall at the mouth of the corridor. Before the Zombie can get its balance, the big Trooper reaches down and grabs the creature's jacket lapels. With all his might he flings the creature out against the balcony railing. The creature flips over the rail, but does not fall. Its arms and legs flailing as Peter comes up quickly behind and flips it over the rail. The creature makes no sound as it plummets to the concourse below.310	Roger fires again at a Zombie drawing dangerously near. Other	creatures throughout the area are again converging on the Department Store entrance.311	Peter wheels the barrow into the corridor and sees Steve at the	other end, the three Zombies are still closing in.	Peter:	HOLD IT FLYBOY!312	Steve freezes. He can barely see Peter, his vision blocked by the Zombies. The creatures are about thirty feet away.313	Peter:	DON'T GO INTO THE STAIRWAY!314	Stephen is confused. The creatures advance.315	Peter:	DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR, BABY. YOU'LL LEAD 'EM RIGHT UP WITH YOU. 
316	Steve is on the verge of panic. 
Peter:	RUN FOR IT.  RUN THIS WAY. The Zombies are drawing closer and closer.317	Peter:	COME ON, MAN. RUN THIS WAY. YOU CAN RUN RIGHT THROUGH 'EM. WE GOTTA LEAD 'EM AWAY FROM HERE! 
318	Steve sizes up the corridor. It is narrow, but there is room to run past the Zombies. 
319	Peter:	COME ON, FLYBOY. YOU CAN MAKE IT. COME ON! 
320	With a sudden move, Steve breaks into a run. He passes the first	creature easily. The second grabs him as he runs past, but the man keeps his footing even though he slams against the wall. He keeps moving forward. The third creatures stands in his path. Steve lowers his head and slams into the Zombie's chest. The creature flies back and falls. Steve falls and tumbles toward the mouth of the passageway. He regains his footing as the creatures turn to pursue him, he runs to the end of the hall where Peter waits.	Peter:	NOW...HEAD FOR THE DEPARTMENT STORE...GO!321	The two men run across the balcony. They slam into two other	Zombies which clutch and grab at them without success. 
322	At the entrance arch to the store, Roger fires at another creature. It falls. Other Zombies are approaching, but Steve and Peter dive into the arch and the three men manage to lower the gate without a problem. 
The Zombies converge on the area as they did before, clutching and pushing at the metal cage, which holds them out securely. 
The men breathe heavily as they back away from the gate. 
Peter:	DOWNSTAIRS AGAIN ...SAME TRICK. 
323	The men move through the aisles of the store and go crashing down the escalator. 
324	On the first floor they run toward the lower gate where they pull up wheezing with exhaustion. 
Steve:	WHAT DO WE DO... 
Roger:	LET 'EM KNOW WE'RE HERE... (shouting) WHOOOO HOOOOOO...OVER HERE...YEEE HAAAAAAAA.	Steve starts to laugh at the ludicrous situation. Peter smiles at the young pilot. 
Peter:	YOU DID ALRIGHT THIS TIME FLYBOY. HOW 'BOUT IT? 
Stephen laughs some more, nervously at first, then whole- Heartedly. Then he lets out a loud: 
Steve:	WHOOOOOOOOOOOPEEEEEEEEE... 
He has joined the cowboys. He is like a child, almost exultant with the joy of their victory... The three men shout through the cage at the creatures, which are	already gathering at the gate. 
325	Out on the concourse, a few Zombies wander aimlessly, but most are heading for the commotion on the first floor arch. 
326	On the upstairs balcony, Zombies again move toward the stationary steps and the escalators. 
327	The three creatures in the Administration corridor move toward the open mall. Two walk out on the balcony, but the last one turns into an open office. Then it staggers back out and heads down the hall toward the firestair. 
328	Fran can faintly hear the "whooping" of the men as she moves toward the stairway door, which is still open.329	She steps onto the landing and looks down into the darkness. The	shouting stops. Desperate with fear, she moves back to the storage room, then back onto the landing. Now her fear turns into anger.	Fran:	SHIT...	She takes a few steps down the stairs. Stops. Goes back up. Fran:	GOD DAMMIT! She starts back down again. 
330	In the corridor below, the creature walks into another office. Then it moves back into the hall. 
331	The Zombies crash against the first floor gate. It holds. The men crouch in the shadows of the gate. 
Roger:	WE JUST GOTTA WAIT LONGER BEFORE WE MOVE. 
Peter:	NO. THERE'S ALWAYS A CHANCE OF SOME OF THEM STAYIN' UP ON THE BALCONY. 
Peter:	JUST DROP, I GOT YOU... 
Steve:	I CAN'T...I... 
Peter:	(to Roger) THE DESK...GIMME A HAND. 
The two Troopers grab the desk and slide it away from the President's corpse. The action causes the chair to spin slightly and his wide terrified eyes seem to watch the action. 
The desk in place. Steve's toes can reach its surface. He loses his balance slightly and pulls back up. He kicks a picture frame off the desk onto the floor, shattering the glass over photos of the President's wife and children. 
Peter:	COME ON! 
Steve finally gets footing on the desktop and lowers himself down. He stares at the corpse as Roger helps him off the desk. 
362	Peter is already unlocking the door to the corridor. He opens it a crack and peeks out. 
363	The corridor is empty. He sees the door at the end which leads to the exterior corridor. 
364	As the other men come up behind, Peter opens the door quietly and slips into the hall. He starts to walk quickly toward the door to the exterior corridor. Roger follows as Stephen moves backwards toward the fire stairs. 
365	Peter's hands grab the barrow and pulls the cart down the corridor backwards so as to face the mall opening. 
366	In the corridor, Steve clutches the maintenance manual. Peter backs slowly up the hall. The wheels squeak and the big man bites his lip. Roger kicks the last corpse to the wall. Steve notices that the fire stairs door is open wide. 
Steve:	JESUS CHRIST! 
He bounds towards the door. Roger spins to see what happened. Peter turns and quickens his pace. Steve trots up the steps. 
Roger:	(to Peter) COME ON...YOU GOT IT. 
Peter runs with the cart the last few yards. As he gets to the doorway, Roger breaks up the steps. 
368	Steve breaks into the storage area...he drops the manual... 
Steve:	FRANNIE! 
369	The woman turns in Steve's direction. The Zombie swats the flare out of Fran's hand. She startles and the cartons feel as though they will topple. She steadies herself with both hands. The creature is grabbing at her legs. She kicks. 
370	Steve raises his rifle and moves in for a close shot. 
Roger:	DON'T SHOOT...THEY'LL HEAR YA... 
Roger arrives and the two men charge the pyramid. 
371	The creature is still clutching at Fran. She kicks violently as Roger pulls the back of the Zombie's clothing. The Zombie falls and hits the floor. As it kneels up, Steve swings the butt of his rifle and smashes it into the thing's head. Then Roger delivers a blow with his gun, straight down. 
372	Steve rushes to Fran. She falls off the cartons into his arms sobbing and choking. 
Steve:	FRANNIE...ARE YOU ALRIGHT? YOU OK, FRANNIE? HEY... 
The woman is incoherent. She is clutching at her stomach. 
373	Peter appears in the doorway carrying the TV and several other items. He dumps them on the floor. 
Peter:	LET'S GET THIS STUFF UP, COME ON. 
374	Roger is dragging the dead Zombie to the door. Peter comes to help and Fran starts to wretch. Steve tries to calm her. He gets some water in a can and brings it over. 
Steve:	FRANNIE...IT'S OK...COME ON, IT'S OK...ARE YOU HURT, HUN? DID YA HURT YOURSELF? FRANNIE... 
375	Downstairs, at the exterior corridor, Peter peeks out. He can see the mall at the far end. The coast is clear. He and Roger hurriedly carry the corpse into the hall and roll it onto the floor and retreat back into the fire stairs. Peter holds open the door slightly and watches the corridor for a moment. Convinced they've not been seen, he closes the door. 
376	Peter:	I THINK WE'RE OK, BROTHER. 
They grab more supplies from the barrow and start upstairs. 
377	Steve still tries to comfort Fran. 
Steve:	WE'RE OK...WE'RE ALL OK...WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF...ALL KINDS OF STUFF... 
In the background the two Troopers bring their load of supplies into the big room and deposit them near the TV. Then they go downstairs for another load. 
Steve:	THIS IS A TERRIFIC PLACE...FRANNIE. THIS PLACE IS PERFECT. WE GOT IT MADE IN HERE...FRANNIE. 
The woman still cannot stop sobbing and retching. 
378	Now, the enormous barricade of food cartons is stacked against the door again. It is quiet except for the little noises of eating and occasional rustle of paper. We also head a faint electronic whistle, but we do not recognise it. 
As we see more of the room, we find our refugees sitting near the reconstructed pyramid on the floor. Peter seems to be asleep up against the pyramid. Roger is nibbling at delicacies from the Department Store's Gourmet department. 
Their "loot" is laid around them on the floor. Roger, as he eats, is leafing through the maintenance manual. There is a stack of tools, some still in wrapping; electric razors, still boxed; some clothing articles; the radio, which also plays small cassettes. There are soaps, toiletries, pens, pencils, and notebooks, flashlights, cigarettes and several decks of cards with a canister of chips. The items are clearly not all functional. Some are representative of the luxuries considered necessary by a consumer society. 
They are all bathed in the blue glow from the television which Stephen tries to tune in. Its power cable is spliced into the leads of a bare light fixture overhead. Fran cannot be seen at first. 
383	Fran ducks back onto her blanket. She disgustedly lights another cigarette. Steve sits next to her again. 
Steve:	FRANNIE... 
She doesn't respond. 
Steve:	DAMMIT, FRAN, YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES WE'D HAVE TO LAND FOR FUEL TRYIN' TO MAKE IT UP NORTH? THOSE THINGS ARE OUT THERE EVERYWHERE. AND THE AUTHORITIES WOULD GIVE US JUST AS HARD A TIME... MAYBE WORSE... WE'RE IN GOOD SHAPE HERE, FRANNIE. WE GOT EVERYTHING WE NEED RIGHT HERE! 
Stephen curls up with his head on the rolled blanket. 
Steve:	COME ON...GET SOME SLEEP. 
The woman doesn't move. 
Steve:	FRANNIE. COME ON. 
She grinds her cigarette out on the concrete floor and stretches out next to the man. He puts his arm around her. His hands rub up and down her body as he curls next to her. He opens her blouse and reaches inside. He closes his eyes and he seems perfectly comfortable to rest in her softness. His hand moves under her clothing. She doesn't respond, at first, then her body relaxes somewhat and she brings one of her arms up around his head. 
Steve:	I'M NOT JUST BEING STUBBORN. I REALLY THINK THIS IS BETTER. HELL. YOU'RE THE ONE'S BEEN WANTIN' TO SET UP HOUSE. 
She stares off across the barren room. His hands continues to move under her blouse. 
384	In the Administration Corridor, a few stray Zombies wander among the corpses on the floor. One large and severely wounded creature pounds on the door to the interior corridor. It had been the one which was pounding at the door upstairs. 
A female Zombie squats near one of the corpses in the hall. She lifts its arm and moves it to her mouth, but she drops it quickly, repelled by its coldness. She leans over and picks at another corpse, then she stands and drifts towards the mall. 
Slowly the creatures leaves the corridor and move out onto the second floor balcony. We begin to hear a voice fading in over the scene. 
Voice:	...NOT ACTUALLY CANNIBALISM...CANNIBALISM IN THE TRUE SENSE OF THE WORD, IMPLIES AN INTRASPECIE ACTIVITY... THESE CREATURES CANNOT BE CONSIDERED HUMAN..THEY PREY ON HUMANS...THEY DO NOT PREY ON EACH OTHER. 
385	We see the mall balcony now. Zombies wander past the stores. Some move down the stationary stairs onto the main concourse. Below. 
Voice:	THEY ATTACK AND...AND FEED...ONLY ON WARM HUMAN FLESH... 
386	At the mall entrances, some creatures drift out into the night. Others still enter the enormous building. There are not as many as there were in the afternoon, but there are certainly enough to be threatening. 
Voice:	INTELLIGENCE? SEEMINGLY LITTLE OR NO REASONING POWER. WHAT BASIC SKILLS REMAIN ARE MORE REMEMBERED BEHAVIOURS FROM...FROM NORMAL LIFE. 
387	Several creatures are clawing at the roll gate to the department store. It is a strange and eerie sight. The staring, painted eyes of the mannequins within the store seem to watch the Zombies. The gate rattles but does not budge. 
Voice:	THERE ARE REPORTS OF THE CREATURES USING TOOLS, BUT EVEN THESE ACTIONS ARE THE MOST PRIMITIVE... THE USE OF EXTERNAL ARTICLES AS BLUDGEONS ETC., EVEN ANIMALS WILL ADOPT THE BASIC USE OF TOOLS IN THIS MANNER. 
388	Fran's eyes pop open the voice has awakened her. She has been asleep on the blanket. 
Voice:	THESE CREATURES ARE NOTHING BUT PURE, MOTORISED INSTINCT... 
The woman looks around. Morning sunlight is spilling in through the skylights above. She sits up and peers into the next area of the room. The men are gone. The television is playing. On the tube we see a dishevelled man sitting in an emergency news room reading the report. 
389	Voice:	THEIR ONLY DRIVE IS FOR THE FOOD WHICH SUSTAINS THEM. WE MUST NOT BE LULLED BY THE CONCEPT THAT THESE ARE OUR FAMILY MEMBERS OR OUR FRIENDS. THEY WILL NOT RESPOND TO SUCH EMOTIONS. THEY MUST BE DESTROYED ON SIGHT.... 
390	Fran sees that the barricade of cartons is still in place at the fire stairs door. She looks up. The skylight above the pyramid is open. She realises that the men are on the roof. 
391	At the edge of the roof, Peter looks through binoculars. 
392	About a quarter of a mile away, he sees the large warehouse of a food processing chain. IN the yard and in the large open garages of the building, he sees a fleet on enormous trailer- trucks parked. 
393	Steve:	YOU SURE WE CAN START 'EM. 
Roger:	YOU HAVEN'T SPENT ENOUGH TIME ON THE STREET. 
Peter:	WELL LET'S GET IT UP. THERE'S NOT TOO MANY OF 'EM AROUND YET THIS MORNIN'. 
The big trooper looks down to the parking lot below. 
394	There are not as many Zombies as there were the day before, and they wander aimlessly, spread out rather than in clusters. 
395	The men move for the skylight. 
396	In the storage area below, Fran is examining the maps in the manual. The TV still drones in a low volume. The men climb down into the room. 
Roger:	HEY, FRAN... 
Fran:	I WOULD HAVE MADE COFFEE AND BREAKFAST, BUT I DON'T HAVE MY POTS AND PANS. 
There is a bitterness in her voice. Roger laughs. Steve senses the tension. Peter just straps on his equipment. 
Fran:	CAN I SAY SOMETHING? 
Steve:	SURE. WHAT DP YOU MEAN? 
Fran:	I'M SORRY YOU FOUND OUT I'M PREGNANT, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT ANY OF YOU TO TREAT ME DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU'D TREAT ANOTHER GUY. 
Steve:	HEY, FRANNIE, COME ON... 
403	On the roof of the mall, Fran clutches her rifle. She sees the big trucks roar up over the hill, the helicopter just above them. It is a strange looking convoy as it speeds toward the trucks as closely as it can. 
404	Along the road, several Zombies try to stagger after the trucks but they are left in the dust of the speeding vehicles. The creatures lumber along slowly behind. 
405	The vehicles pull into the little grade which loads into the mall's parking lot. They roar right toward the building. 
406	At one of the building entrances, a cluster of Zombies is moving in and lot of the main doors. Others wander nearby in the parking lot. Attracted by the sounds of the engines, the creatures turn and face the trucks. 
As Peter pulls his vehicle in a wide arc, Roger drives his right up to the side of the building and roars toward the entrance doors. Then he skips his right wheels up onto the curb, and with a great, scraping crunch, the big truck pulls directly abreast of the building, flush with the entrance. The huge vehicle crushes several of the helpless creatures and knocks other flying back. 
407	The trailer of the truck has totally blocked off the mall entrance. Several Zombies trapped inside try to push the glass doors open. The doors move, but cannot be opened wide enough for the creatures to get out. 
408	The few creatures immediately around the truck begin clambering at its sides. Roger shuts off the engine and grabs his gun as other Zombies begin clutching at the windows of the cab. 
409	Overhead, the whirlybird hovers very close by. Now Peter's big truck pulls up alongside so that Peter's passenger door is directly abreast of the free door on Roger's cab. 
Peter's truck also crushes one or two of the creatures, but there are still several in the immediate vicinity of the cab. 
410	As Roger opens his door and scrambles into the other truck, one of the Zombies grabs hold. Roger just manages to kick the creature off as the big truck pulls out and roars across the lot. 
411	The helicopter flies straight up and directly over the roof of the big shopping centre, where Fran has been watching the action. She now runs to the other side of the roof, the wind from the chopper whipping her hair. 
412	The chopper turns and waits for the big truck to move up under it, then the whirlybird escorts the trailer back to the warehouse down the road. 
413	Roger is whooping and hollering like a cowboy as the big rig pulls up beside another of the parked vans. 
Peter:	COME ON, COME ON... THREE MORE BABY. 
Roger:	LIKE A CHARM, HUH? LIKE A FUCKING CHARM! 
Roger grabs his knapsack and climbs into the new cab where he immediately goes to work on jumping the engine cables. 
414	From the helicopter overhead, Stephen spots something moving around the warehouse. He jockeys the chopper slightly for a better look and he sees a small group of Zombies wandering out of the big garage directly toward Roger's truck. 
415	In the meantime, Peter's truck pulls away from the cab Roger is in. The big vehicle rolls into the large paved area behind the warehouse where Peter can turn it around easily. 
416	Stephen swoops down with the big bird. He buzzes as close as he can to Roger's truck, trying to signal the man. 
417	Roger continues to work on the cables, still whooping like a child. The Zombies are very close at hand. They have just about reached the cab. Stephen buzzes again. Roger doesn't notice. 
418	Peter has now backed up into a position which enables him to pull out. He looks up to see the helicopter heading straight for him. 
419	The big chopper buzzes right over Peter's cab then spins around heading back for Roger. 
420	Peter looks toward the other truck. He can now see the lumbering creatures. He tries to slam the truck into gear, but the complicated shift mechanism fights him. 
421	One Zombie slams its hands against the driver-side window of Roger's truck. The man startles and tries to untangle himself from his cramped position under the big steering wheel. He is stuck for a moment. The other creatures appear at the passenger side of the cab, where the door is open. One grabs at Roger's legs. Roger kicks violently, but can't get a good position. He falls lower onto the floor of the cab, his body almost knotted among the controls and the shift sticks. 
422	Peter's truck starts to roll, but it accelerates slowly. 
423	The helicopter tries to buzz the clutching ghouls, but they do not even flinch. The wind from the propeller blades whip at the creatures' hair, making them look even more frightening as they claw at the desperate Roger. 
424	The man kicks and kicks, but he cannot deliver a solid blow from his pinned position. His hand gropes on the seat of the truck for his rifle, which suddenly fires as the man's fingers inadvertently hit the trigger. A shell blasts through the chest of the lead creature, but the thing pays little attention. 
425	Peter's truck is starting to roll faster. He heads right for Roger's cab. 
426	The helicopter hovers as Stephen tries to see the action. 
427	Now Roger has a good grip on his gun, but he cannot clear the long weapon from around the gear sticks. The lead Zombie is actually scrambling into the cab and is all but on top of the struggling Trooper. 
428	The second creature is about to claw its way in when, with a great roar, Peter's truck swings up and crushes it. 
429	Roger is desperately trying to keep the other Zombie's mouth away. They are wrestling now. The Zombie is weak, as usual, but Roger is still hampered by the position he is in. 
430	Peter has pulled too far past the other truck. He slams his rig into reverse and backs up. Now his window is in a direct line with the open door on Roger's cab. He raises his rifle and aims, but he cannot get a clear shot. He shouts loudly trying to overcome the noise of the truck engine and the hovering helicopter. 
Peter:	GET ITS HEAD UP...GET ITS HEAD UP... 
431	Roger realises that Peter is outside. He struggles with the creature, dropping his gun. His hands manage to get a stranglehold on the creature's neck. He pushes up with all his might. The Zombie's hands are clutching at the man's face. It's fingers push at the man's eyes. 
432	Peter sees the opportunity and fires. The gun roars loudly. 
433	The Zombie's head flies apart. Remnants of blood and brain tissue splatter the inside of the cab and the driver's window. The gummy stuff flies into Roger's face. The Zombie falls limp, but Roger is still desperate. The dead weight of the creature is now on top of him, and the bloody wound runs. Roger is frantic. He frees himself with great heaves of his body and he pushes the creature out of the cab. The man's eyes are wide with revulsion. He instantly brings up his sleeve to wipe the stains from his face. He is quivering in extremes of emotions. 
A sudden crash. Roger spins. The Zombie at the driver door has smashed through the cab window with a brick. Roger, still shaking, dives down to the floor for his weapon. 
434	Peter tries to level off a shot but he cannot because Roger is in the way... 
Peter:	GET DOWN...STAY DOWN...I GOT IT! 
435	Roger, in his adrenalised anger, sits up with his gun and levels off on the creature himself. He fires. The shell crashes through the already shattered glass and squarely into the creatures head. 
Roger:	YOU BASTARDS...YOU BASTARDS... 
462	In Peter's truck, just rolling out the lot, Roger realises: 
Roger:	JESUS! 
Peter:	WHAT? 
Roger:	MY GODDAM BAG...I LEFT MY GODDAM BAG IN THE OTHER TRUCK. 
Peter brings his vehicle to a screeching halt. 
Peter:	ALRIGHT, NOW YOU SON OF A BITCH! YOU BETTER SCREW YOUR FUCKIN' HEAD ON, BABY! 
Roger:	YEAH, YEAH...I'M O.K. LET'S GO. 
Suddenly, Peter grabs the Trooper by his lapels and slams him back against the door of the cab. 
Peter:	I MEAN IT! NOW YOU'RE NOT JUST PLAYIN' WITH YOUR LIFE, YOUR PLAYIN' WITH MINE! 
The two men stare at each other for a moment. Roger is startled somewhat out of his emotional rush. 
Peter:	(softer) ALRIGHT, NOW ARE YOU STRAIGHT? 
Roger:	YEAH. 
Peter lets him go and returns to the wheel. He guns the engine and roars into a big arcing turn in the parking lot. 
463	When Fran sees the truck returning, she looks up from her gun sight. The helicopter has already flown over the roof, and Stephen is confused as to why the truck hadn't appeared on the road. Fran turns and tries to signal to Stephen. 
464	He finally sees her and flies closer. The woman waves a signal and the chopper buzzes back over the lot. 
465	Her hair blowing wildly, Fran takes up her post again, her rifle ready. She thinks a moment, then begins to reload the weapon pulling the shells from her blouse pocket. 
466	Peter's truck zooms back into position, colliding with some of Zombies in the vicinity. 
467	Roger immediately climbs through the windows into the original cab. He snatches up his knapsack and several tools which are strewn over the seat and floor. 
Again, creatures converge on the cab area. Two more come up between the trucks, several come around the front of the cab. 
468	Fran is still loading. 
469	The helicopter buzzes. 
470	As Roger climbs back through the window, his pack accidentally falls to the ground. With reflex action, he drops between the cabs, landing on his feet. He is facing the two creatures which are very close. He reaches up and with on hand on each of the open window frames, he swings his legs up hard. His kick sends the creatures sprawling. Then, he bends to collect his pack and is grabbed from behind. 
471	Peter tries to level off his gun but he cannot get a shot. 
472	Neither can Fran who is shouting from the roof. 
473	Roger keeps his head this time. His first thought is for the pack of tools. He tosses the sack into the cab of Peter's truck as though he were making a hook shot with a basketball. 
474	Peter catches the pack as several of the tools clatter out and onto the floor of the cab. 
475	The creature which has a hold on Roger takes advantage of the man's imbalance from throwing the knapsack. It bites at the man's arm. Roger tears away, but blood appears at the wound. Then Roger squares off a solid punch right to the Zombie's jaw. The creature flies back and almost knocks over the Zombies behind it. Roger jumps, making a grab for the window of Peter's cab. The Zombies between the trucks, which Roger originally kicked away, have regrouped. They advance and grab at the struggling trooper. Roger's feet try to get hold on the side of the door, but they slip. 
476	Peter moves to drop his rifle and grab Roger's hands, but Roger falls from the high window back to the pavement. Peter draws his hand gun. 
477	Roger leaps again, his hands catching the window frame. The Zombies are clutching at him. Again he swings up his legs and kicks the creatures off balance. This time he manages to get his feet locked against the door and Peter grabs the Troopers arm with his free hand, but another Zombie is pulling at the man's shirt and still another makes a grab for his legs. 
Peter reaches out with his pistol and fires a point blank shot at one of the clutching ghouls. It flies back and Roger is able to pull himself higher. His torso is just about through the window when another creature grabs him. 
478	Peter can no longer get a shot as Roger fills the window, so the big man drops his pistol and pulls Roger's arm with all his might. 479	Roger is almost all the way in but his legs still dangle, kicking. Peter starts the truck. As it begins to roll away, one of the clutching Zombies is able to get a solid hold on Roger's left leg. The creature opens its mouth and bites at the calf. Blood appears. The creature bites again and this time it comes away with bits of flesh tangled in a bloodstained strip op material from Roger's trousers. 
480	Roger screams in pain and kicks violently. The truck accelerates and the Zombie finally falls clear. 
481	It rolls on the pavement for a little way before it stops. Then it sits on the ground, looking like a gorilla. It still has a bloody mass of flesh and material in its mouth. With its hands it tries to separate the cloth from the more important morsels. 
A bullet pings into the cement near the chewing Zombie. Another tears through its shoulder. It still is concerned only with its prize. 
482	Fran is firing, swearing through her teeth as the gun roars. She finally hits the seated creature squarely in the head. 
483	We see it fall from her point of view on the roof. Others walk by the corpse without taking notice. 
484	The helicopter escorts the big truck back to the warehouse. 
485	As it rumbles along, Roger, in extreme pain, is tying his belt tightly around his leg as a tourniquet. He sucks air through his teeth in anguish. 
Peter:	THAT'S IT. 
Roger:	BULL SHIT. 
Peter:	WE GOTTA DEAL WITH THAT LEG! 
Roger:	I'M DEALIN' WITH IT...I'M DEALIN' WITH IT FINE! I WON'T BE ABLE TO WALK ON THIS AT ALL IF WE WAIT. 
Fran moves into the store and Peter pulls the cart behind him. Then Steve, Peter and Fran pull the gate shut long before any of the advancing creatures reach the area. 
503	Again, the Zombies smash into the cage, but the humans are already running through the aisles of the big store. 
504	Peter wheels Roger into the elevator and hits the button for the first floor. The doors shut and the car starts down. 
Peter:	HOW'S THE RIDE? 
Roger:	KIND BUMPY. WATCH IT. 
The stern Black face stares down at the back of the wounded man's head. Despite his attempt at humour, the stiffness in Roger's body evidences his pain. Peter puts his hand squarely on the Trooper's shoulder. 
Peter:	LOOK HERE...I... 
Roger:	I KNOW, I KNOW...SHUT UP. 
Something very serious is shared between the two men, some knowledge which we do not fully understand. We do see the kind of bond shared by soldiers in a battle. 
505	The elevator doors glide open and Peter pushes the cart out into the first floor on the big store. 
506	Fran and Stephen charge down the store escalator moving faster than the steps themselves. 
507	They run through the hardware department where Stephen snatches up several propane torches. Fran stuffs extra bottles of gas into her back pack. 
508	With a great hiss one of the propane nozzles spits a white-hot flame as it is lit with a new disposable lighter. Fran holds two torches as Stephen lights them. 
509	Peter steps up to the first floor entrance gate with Roger in front of him. Several creatures outside of the cage fly into sudden frenzy at seeing the humans. They slam against the grid but it holds as usual. 
Peter:	UNLOCK THE MIDDLE ONE LAST. 
510	Steve falls on the right hand lock with his keys. The Zombies all converge near the crouching man's side of the gate. They push and shove. Fran holds one of the lit torches very close and the creatures back away cringing. The lock opens and Steve moves to the extreme left. 
Again the Zombies follow and again Fran is ready with the torch. 
Peter:	ALRIGHT...THE TOUGHEST PART'LL BE GETTIN' BY THESE RIGHT HERE... 
Steve:	IT'S A LONG HAUL DOWN TO THE ENTRANCE. 
511	Peter cranes his neck to see past the Zombies and down the concourse. Several other creatures are starting toward the Department Store. Behind them, about three hundred feet away, is one of the main entrances which is blocked off outside by a truck trailer. 
512	Peter:	WE'LL BE ALRIGHT! 
Fran:	IT'S TOO FAR! 
Peter:	THERE'S NO BACKIN' OUT NOW. WE GOTTA LOCK THOSE DOORS! 
Fran:	WE'LL NEVER MAKE ALL FOUR. IT'S TOO RISKY. 
Steve:	YOU JUST STAY HERE AND BE READY TO UPEN UP FOR US. 
Fran:	THE CAR! 
Peter:	WHAT? 
Fran:	THE CAR! 
513	Outside, we see the slowly spinning exhibit which displays the new automobile. It is a sleek, sporty model, which looks fast and manoeuvrable. 
514	Peter looks down at Roger. 
Peter:	YOU OK TO START IT? 
Roger nods and reaches for his supply pack. He is cringing with pain, but he moves efficiently. 
515	The Zombies clutch at the gate with new vigour. At the unlocked ends the grid gives a little, but still holds the creature out. Fran waves the torches closer and the creatures back away. Steve un-locks the middle lock. 
Steve:	IT'S GOIN' UP! 
516	The gate swings up with a thunderous roar. The Zombies attack but Fran's torches make them hold back slightly. Steve grabs one of the propane canisters with one hand and draws a pistol with the other. Fran draws a hand gun also. The two fire into the pack of Zombies. One or two fall. The others try to move in but are afraid of the bright flames. One gets close to Steve but the man blasts his torch directly into its face. Its hair catches on fire and the creature throws itself wildly about, knocking other Zombies back. 
517	Now Peter sees an opening and he makes a break with the cart. Roger holds on to the sides. They crash through the scattered pack of ghouls successfully and Peter makes for the car exhibit. There are a few creatures on the concourse on the cart's path. 
Peter:	(shouting) CLOSE THE GATE...CLOSE THE GATE... 
518	Steve grabs the lip of the roll cage and it starts down. Fran is still inside the store with one of the torches. 
Fran:	THE KEYS, STEPHEN...THE KEYS! 
Steve tries to stop the downward progress of the gate but it slams shut with a metallic crash. 
Fran:	JESUS CHRIST! 
519	Peter stops in his tracks when he hears the woman's shouts. He looks back. Several of the creatures have followed the cart. They advance slowly. 
Peter:	I'M HOPIN' THEY'LL JUST GO AWAY AFTER THEY FIND THEY CAN'T GET IN... 
546	The creatures moving slowly down the concourse are now getting close to the action. 
547	The men hop back into the car, it roars off with Roger still at the wheel. 
548	Again the sleek auto rips through the ranks of the advancing Zombies. They fall and scatter. 
549	The car speeds down the concourse, turns the corner near where Fran watches at the Department Store game. We hear Steve's voice on the woman's walkie talkie. 
Steve:	WE'RE OK...WE GOT IT MADE...IT'GONNA WORK. 
Fran stares out through the roll cage. The Zombies are staggering weakly after the car. 
550	With another tailspin, the auto pulls up at the second set of doors. The men scramble out of the back seat, the Zombies outside try to crawl under the second trailer. The men shut them out easily, locking the door and planting alarms. They stand to look down the concourse. 
551	The creatures seem even more spread out now. 
Steve:	HOW MANY YOU FIGURE ARE ALREADY IN... 
Peter:	DUNNO. NOT TOO MANY. WE'LL GET 'EM EASY. WE GET IT ALL LOCKED OFF AND WE'RE GOIN' ON A HUNT! 
The big Trooper raises his super-gun and sights through the telescope. 
552	As we see through the scope, cross hairs settle on the forehead of one of the creatures which is lumbering down the hall. The face is magnified, distorted by the telescope. The gun roars and the head in the scope explodes with red. 
553	The creature falls against a column, hit squarely through the brain. We sense the supreme accuracy of the magnificent weapon. 
554	It is night. The Zombies in the parking lot still group around the semis. They set up an eerie moaning in the moonlight. A slow piece of music starts to build. 
555	The creatures crawl under the trucks but cannot enter the mall. They pound and scratch at the doors, to no avail. 
556	From inside the concourse, the mob is muffled. Even the revolving door is locked now. It seems the most vulnerable, but the crawling creatures cannot quite get leverage to smash the glass panels and they have no tools to pound with. 
The auto is flush against the revolving doors inside, offering added protection. Several alarm units sit atop the car. They are the early warning devices against penetration. 
557	They camera starts to dolly back, the music builds. We see slain corpses of many Zombies lying askew in various parts of the building. It is like a battlefield after a war. 
558	The humans appear on the second storey balcony. Moving to the railing, looking down to the expanse of the building. They are guerrilla fighters, with their weapons strapped on. They have taken the Temple. The music hits a crescendo as the people look over their spoils. Even the wounded Roger seems triumphant as he limps to the rails, supporting himself on his arms. 
559	We see a spectacular shot of the full expanse of the building. Zombies lie dead everywhere. The humans have captures the gold of the Gods...In this case the Gods of Consumer Heaven. 
560	Peter's hand is on the maps of the Maintenance Corridor. He is drawing a line past the washrooms at the end of the hall near the firestair. 
Peter:	WE PUT UP THE WALL HERE. THERE'S NO DOOR FROM THE LAST OFFICE INTO THE WASHROOMS, SO NOBODY'LL GET NOSEY...AND THIS WAY WE CAN STILL GET TO THE PLUMBING... 
Steve:	WHY CAN'T WE JUST BOARD UP THE STAIRWAY. HELL, THEY CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH A STACK OF CARTONS. 
Peter:	I'M NOT JUST WORRYIN' ABOUT THEM. SOONER OR LATER MIGHT BE A PATROL THROUGH HERE...LOOTERS MAYBE...I DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO EVEN KNOW THAT STAIRWAY EXISTS. 
They look back at the map. 
Peter:	THE DUCTWORK RUNS ALL THE WAY INTO THE WASHROOMS. WE'LL HAVE TO GET IN AND OUT THAT WAY. WE'LL BRING UP ANY BUG STUFF WE WANT BEFORE WE PUT UP THE WALL. 
561	The men sit huddled. The large storage area is filled with mounds of supplies brought up from the mall stores, but the stuff all sits around in disarray. 
562	Behind the wall of cartons, Roger seems to be sleeping, but he is sweating feverishly, and his face twitches. Fran has been trying to soothe him with a wet cloth on his forehead. Now she stops, leaving the cloth on the shivering head. She moves out to Stephen and Peter. 
563	Fran:	HE SEEMS TO BE SLEEPING. 
Peter:	GOOD. 
564	The woman moves to where she has medical supplies on one of the cartons. There are bottles, vials and diabetic hypo syringes as well as bandages and dressings from the Pharmacy in the mall. 
Fran:	I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO... 
Steve:	YOU'RE DOIN' FINE. 
Fran:	HIS LEG IS AWFUL...THE INFECTION IS SPREADING FAST. CAN'T WE FLY HIM OUT OF HERE...TRY TO FIND A MED. UNIT... 
565	Steve looks at Peter. The big trooper speaks softly. 
Peter:	I'VE SEEN HALF A DOZEN GUYS GET BITTEN BY THOSE THINGS...NONE OF 'EM LASTED MORE THAN THIRTY SIX HOURS. 
566	Fran is stunned. Suddenly, Roger screams from behind the cartons. 
Roger:	PETER...PETER...WHERE ARE YOU? 
567	Peter:	RIGHT HERE, BUDDY. 
568	Roger is sitting up. His eyes look very dark and sunken. He is sweating even more profusely than before. 
Roger:	YEAH...YEAH... 
579	In the vault, the big Trooper dumps bodies out on top of several others, already deposited. The corpses lie askew, their arms and legs protruding. The stacks of money are upset by the limp action of the bodies as they roll around. 
580	A finger flips a switch and we hear the mall music start up slowly. 
581	We see a montage: Fran, Stephen and Peter walk slowly through the conquered building. They drift in and out of stores picking up various items. They use shopping carts. 
582	Fran rummages idly through the cosmetic department. 
583	Peter looks through a book store. 
584	Stephen plays the pinball machines in a huge game room. 
585	Peter tries on big colourful hats in front if a mirror. 
586	Fran trims Stephen's hair as he sits in the mechanical chair of the mall Barber Shop. 
587	Fran feeds the animals in the Pet Store, then with a bag of seed, she feeds the Tropical Birds in the tall cage out on the concourse. The birds flutter, flap about, screeching loudly. 
588	Now the group walk along the upper balcony. They look down. They still have their weapons and kits, Peter is wearing a wide brimmed hat and Fran sports a new mink coat. 
589	The concourse is empty now of corpses, but the group can hear the moaning and thumping at the main entrances. It is dark outside, the creatures claw at the doors but cannot be seen in the shadows under the big trailer trucks. The sound evidences their presence, however. 
590	The people stand at the balcony railing overlooking their realm. 
Fran:	THEY'RE STILL HERE. 
Steve:	THEY'RE AFTER US...THEY KNOW WE'RE IN HERE. 
Peter:	THEY'RE AFTER THE PLACE...THEY DON'T KNOW WHY...THEY JUST REMEMBER...REMEMBER THAT THEY WANNA BE IN HERE! 
The noise at the entrance continues eerily. Fran starts to be afraid. 
Fran:	WHAT THE HELL ARE THEY? 
Peter:	THEY'RE US, THAT'S ALL. THERE'S NO MORE ROOM IN HELL. 
Steve:	WHAT? 
Peter:	SOMETHIN' MY GRANDADDY USED TO TELL US...YOU KNOW MACUMBA? VOODOO... GRANDADDY WAS A PRIEST IN TRINIDAD. USED TO TELL US...WHEN THERE'S NO MORE ROOM IN HELL...THE DEAD WILL WALK THE EARTH. 
591	Roger is screaming wildly. He is sweating and his face looks sunken with an ashen colour. He thrashes about as Steve tries to hold him. His leg is swollen, almost all black. His arm, which was also bitten, is wrapped but oozing. 
Steve:	GET MORE VALIUM IN HIM... 
Fran fumbles with one of the hypodermics, but she drops the vial of serum and it shatters on the floor. 
Steve:	GET ANOTHER ONE...COME ON... 
Roger is throwing himself about wildly. Steve barely manages to hold on. Fran rushes into the other room. 
592	The space is starting to look like living quarters. There is furniture. There are sectioned off areas with things still packed in cartons, but it is beginning to look like home. 
593	The woman rushes to the medical supply area which is now more organised with little cabinets and a small refrigerator. She takes a new vial of serum from the freezer. 
594	Downstairs, Peter is checking the covering at the floor base of the fake wall. He hears the violent screaming from above. 
595	He climbs up a rope ladder in the ceiling, scrambles through the grill in the ceiling, enters the duct. Then he pulls up the ladder and closes the grill. 
596	He crawls through the tight space for a few feet, and drops out of another grill into the washroom. 
597	He moves through the internal corridor and into the firestair. 
598	All the while, Roger's screaming can be heard. Peter tramps up the stairs several at a time. 
599	He rushes through the living space in the direction of the screams. 
600	Fran is withdrawing a hypodermic from Roger's good arm. The man still thrashes wildly. Steve is struggling to hold him. Peter rushes in and helps. Fran drifts out of the room. 
After a short time Roger relaxes somewhat. 
Peter:	(to Steve) GO ON...I'LL STAY WITH HIM. 
Steve leaves the area. 
601	In the living spaces, Fran is sitting in a chair. It is the inflatable kind, which can be collapsed like a balloon. Steve comes up to her and puts his arms around her neck from behind. She cups his hands with hers and holds them tightly. She stares off across the room. 
602	Roger catches his breath and looks up at Peter. He licks his lips and tries to speak coherently. 
Roger:	YOU...YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME, RIGHT, PETER? YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF ME...WHEN I GO... 
Peter:	I WILL. 
Roger:	I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND LIKE THAT PETER... NOT AFTER I GO...I DON'T WANNA BE WALKIN' AROUND LIKE THAT... 
From the movement beneath, the blanket starts to creep down off Roger's face. Peter stares with fascination and disbelief. The blanket clears the blankly staring eyes...the drooling mouth...Roger tries to sit up/ Peter's hands click a shell into his super-gun. 
Suddenly, the corpse sits up. It stares at Peter, blankly at first, then with purpose...it starts to move towards the Trooper who calmly raises his weapon... 
611	On the TV, the commotion still rages. Stephen and Fran stare at the tube, hardly believing what they see. The scientist is shouting above the din. He is nervous. He wipes his brow with his sleeve... 
Scientist:   WE'VE GOT TO REMAIN UNEMOTIONAL...UNEMOTIONAL... RATIONAL...LOGICAL...TACTICAL! TACTICAL! 
612	Steve:	THEY'RE CRAZY...THEY'RE CRAZY... 
Fran:	IT'S REALLY...ALL OVER, ISN'T IT... 
BLAM! The loud roar of Peter's gun from the next room. Fran startles and falls into Stephen's arms. 
613	Roger's corpse is dumped on top of the stack of bodies in the Bank vault. His eyes stare with a puzzled expression. The arms and legs of the other bodies make the room look like a Renaissance Painting of hell itself. There is the familiar gunshot wound in Roger's forehead. 
The heavy door of the vault closes with a metallic slam which echoes through out the mall. 
614	A small puppy lifts its leg and urinates on a table. 
Fran:	ADAM! NO NO! 
The woman's hands reach into frame and grab the little animal. She carries it through the room and drops it on some papers laid out in an unused part of the storage area. 
Fran's stomach is big now, her pregnancy evident. She wipes her brow like an exhausted housewife, and shuffles back into the living area. She fumbles with the sheets on the double mattress which she and Steve obviously share. There is an end table near the bed, with a reading light. Books lie strewn around, along with magazines and half drunk cups of coffee. 
615	In the sitting room, we see a scene which could be comfortable suburban. The furniture is neatly arranged. There is a small portable stove which operates on bottled gas, a refrigerator, and cabinets with dishes and silverware. 
616	There is a modern calendar on the wall, which has three months crossed off. There are a variety of radio and TV units and a stereo record player. There are even decorations: paintings hung, knick knacks on the tables. The room almost looks like a wealthy man's den, with all the gadget-oriented affluence. 
617	In the Department Store, Stephen wanders about. He fiddles with a new supersonic calculator and he looks at adult games. 
618	On the roof, in the bright sun of early morning, Peter plays tennis against one of the shed walls. He's dressed in a new sweat suit with brightly coloured Addidas sneakers. He has a sleek new racquet, slamming phosphorescent balls with all his might. His face is set in what is almost anger. He attacks each shot with determination and emotion. 
619	One of his shots misses the shed. The ball bounces and banks off the lip of the roof, then it tumbles over the edge. 
620	In the parking lot below, the ball hits the pavement. It bounces several times, rolling off among the feet of the army of Zombies wandering this way and that through the area. 
621	The creatures mob around the trucks at the main entrances. They moan and gurgle, clawing at the building. There seem to be hundreds of them, all different ages, sexes, shapes. Some clothed, some naked, some wounded, some almost untouched. 
622	Now Fran, the pregnant housewife, is cooking supper. 
623	The men play cards with hundred dollar bills in the living space. 
624	The three sit around the dinner table, just finishing their supper. The TV set is on, but only grey snow fills the screen and the speaker hisses as it receives no signal. 
Fran:	THERE HASN'T BEEN A BROADCAST FOR THREE DAYS. WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT UP? 
Steve:	THEY MIGHT COME BACK ON. 
Fran angrily throws down her silverware and stomps over to the TV. She clicks it off. The woman returns to the table. 
Steve stands up and moves to the set. He clicks it back on. Peter watches the two sheepishly. It is a domestic scene. The group has become a family, with all the disadvantages of comfortable living, including the inability to communicate. 
Fran:	WHAT HAVE WE DONE TO OURSELVES? 
625	The thunderous roar of the helicopter engine. The machine is hovering over the roof of the mall. 
626	Fran is at the controls. Steve sits in the passenger seat. 
Steve:	OK, NOW EASY...EASY...BRING 'ER DOWN... 
627	The whirlybird starts down for the roof. It is somewhat unstable, but it eases down regularly. 
628	In the cockpit, a flustered Fran manages to handle the controls. 
Steve:	EASY...STABILISE IT...THAT'S IT... 
The woman reacts efficiently. She handles the controls better as The chopper's runners are just about on the roofs surface. 
Steve:	THAT'S IT...THAT'S IT...YOU GOT IT! 
629	The runners hit the roof surface and the chopper settles. 
630	Fran throws her arms impulsively around Stephen's neck. 
Steve:	YOU DID IT...YOU DID IT, HON...YOU DID IT... 
The woman excitedly hugs and kisses Stephen with childish joy. She is bubbling. 
631	Seen from a great distance, the helicopter atop the mall looks very small. Its engine dies and begins to whine. 
632	A pair of binoculars is watching the action. The lenses pull away from a pair of beady eyes. 
Peter:	WELL LET'S NOT MAKE IT EASY FOR 'EM...COME ON! 
642	The men charge down through the skylight. The roar of the convoy can now be heard in the living space. 
Fran is desperate. Steve rushes by her with Peter, who crashes on ahead through the door onto the firestairs. 
Fran:	WHAT'S HAPPENING? 
Steve:	THERE'S FIFTEEN OR TWENTY OF 'EM... WE'RE GONNA SHUT OFF THE GATES. 
Fran:	STEPHEN! 
Steve:	WE'RE JUST GONNA SHUT THE GATES. THEY'LL NEVER FIND US UP HERE. 
The man disappears through the stairway door. Fran drops the puppy which goes running after the men floppily. 
Fran thinks to chase the dog, but instead moves to the storage area and snatches her weapons. She starts to load her rifle. 
643	Outside, the convoy makes a pass at one of the trucks. In the darkness the Zombies clutch at the fast bikes. The raiders fire their guns, dropping several of the creatures. 
The mob of creatures is impenetrable at first. The raiders leader signals the convoy to drop back across the parking lot. Some raiders have trouble keeping balance as Zombies claw them. 
644	The lead bikes pull up on the other side of the lot. 
Raider:	 THEY'LL SPREAD OUT COMIN' AFTER US... THEN WE GO IN WITH THE VAN... 
645	The other bikes ride to the leaders. A van pulls in and two bikers scramble aboard through the side doors. One of the women jumps into the driver's seat and revs the engine. 
646	The Zombies are starting to move out after the convoy. The mob at the mall entrance is thinning somewhat. 
647	In the mall, Peter drops from the grill in the exterior corridor. He charges out and into the Maintenance corridor, where he breaks for the mall proper. He is followed by Stephen. 
Peter:	(shouting) DOWNSTAIRS FIRST... 
Steve:	OK... 
Peter:	GOT YOUR TALK BOX? 
Steve:	YEAH. 
Peter:	KEEP IS HANDY. 
648	Outside, the Raiders' van revs and roars towards the mall. The bikers stay at the other side of the lot, engines idling. Some of them whoop and holler like American Indians. 
649	The van crashes through the advancing Zombies. Several of them are knocked flying. The vehicle pulls up to the truck cab. Three men pile out and scramble into the truck. The Zombies in the area clutch at the raiders, but they fight their way clear. The woman in the van revs the engine again. Zombies claw at her window. She squeals back to the main biker group. 
650	The Zombies in the parking lot are approaching the ranks of motorcycles from a good distance. The raiders open fire. They, too, possess sophisticated weapons, the barrage sets up a great noise. Several creatures fall. The little van pulls up behind the bikes. The men still whoop and shout. 
651	On the floor on the mall, Peter and Steve dash about slamming roll gates down on the open stores. They run desperately through the empty concourses. They hear the din from outside. 
652	At the trailer cab, a raider fires point blank at the Zombies that claw at the passenger window. Another man checks cables. 
Raider:	 SHIT...IT'S STILL TAPED UP...IT'S ALL READY FOR US... 
The man sits at the wheel, revving the engine. Ghouls at windows. 
653	Inside, the men hear the truck starting. Steve slams down the Pharmacy gate. Peter is already running to the Department Store. The big Trooper crashes up the escalator to the second floor aisles. Steve breaks for the open Hardware Store. 
654	The huge trailer rolls away from the mall entrance. A shout of victory goes up from the raiders. The Zombies at the door do not yet enter the mall, their focus on the raiders now. From other entrances Zombies start converging on the parking lot. 
655	Across the lot, the bikers rev their engines ready to make a run on the building. The raiders in the truck hop from the cab. They run to the doors, shooting Zombies at they move. Some creatures fall, others claw at the runners. One raider is brought down by the ghouls. His friends pay no attention. 
656	One gunman slams into the mall doors to find they are locked. He levels his machine gun on the locks and rips open the mechanism. The men push through the doors. The little alarm units are knocked flying sending out a high pitched signal. 
657	Peter is just slamming down the gates on the balcony when he hears the alarms go off. 
658	One of the raiders hears the gates rumbling. He looks up and sees Peter running by the railing upstairs. He fires with his machine gun. 
659	Peter dives, sliding across the balcony. The bullets miss him and he crawls around the balcony just out of sight from below. 
660	Steve has just slammed down the Hardware Store gate, and makes a dash for the Department Store. 
661	The raiders spot him as well, and open fire. 
662	Steve runs zip-zag and dives into the big store, where he ducks into the shadows leaving the gate open. 
663	Peter, at the balcony railing, levels his super-gun on the bikers. 
664	One accurate shot fires and a raider falls with a giant wound in his chest. 
665	The last raider at the doors ducks out of Peter's sight. 
666	Steve now charges the roll gate and slams it shut on the store.

[Chinese guard is seen walking on The Great Wall.  Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and hits the guard on the head knocking his helmet off.  The falcon lands on top of a flag pole in front of a full moon and lets out a large cry.  One grappling hook comes over The Great Wall.  The guard walks over to the edge and sees many grappling hooks coming towards him] 
Guard [yelling]:  We're under attack!  Light the signal! 
[Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long Hair Man appear trying to stop him.  Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with his sword just as Guard reaches the top.  The guard picks up the torch to light the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge of the tower and looks at him across from the caldron.  The guard throws the torch into the caldron lighting a large fire.  Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons one by one] 
Guard [sternly]:  Now all of China knows you're here. 
Shan-Yu [taking the flag and holding it over the fire]:  Perfect. 
[Cut to the palace.  The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li walks in flanked on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor. He bows, then looks up] 
General Li:  Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border. 
Chi Fu:  Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall.  [The Emperor motions for Chi Fu's silence] 
General Li:  Shun-Yu is leading them.  We'll set up defenses around your palace immediately. 
Emperor [forcefully]:  No!  Send your troops to protect my people.  Chi Fu, 
Chi Fu:  Yes, your highness. 
Emperor: Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces.  Call up reserves and as many new recruits as possible. 
General Li:  Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him. 
Emperor:  I wont take any chances, General.  A single grain of rice can tip the scale.  One man may be the difference between victory and defeat. 
[Cut to Mulan using her chopsticks to single out a grain of rice on top of the mound of rice] 
Mulan: Quiet and demure...graceful...polite...[picking up some rice with her chopsticks and eating a mouthful] delicate...refined...poised... [She sets down her chopsticks and writes down a final word on her right arm] punctual. [A cock crows]  Aiya.  [Calling out]  Little brother. Little brother.  Lit- ahhh, there you are.  Who's the smartest doggie in the world?  Come on smart boy, can you help me with my chores today? 
Bath Lady [poking out of her building]:  Fa Li, is your daughter here yet? The matchmaker is not a patient woman.  [She goes back into the building] 
Fa Li:  Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for luck. 
Grandma Fa [walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage]:  How lucky can they be, they're dead.  Besides,  I've got all the luck we'll need.  [Speaking to Cri-Kee]  This is your chance to prove yourself.  [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly. Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street] 
Fa Li [excitedly]:  Grandma No! 
[The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street.  But two horse and carriage collide causing a big accident.  She arrives at the other side of the street, uncovers here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee] 
Grandma Fa:  Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. [Cri-Kee falls over out of fright] 
Fa Li [sighing in relief]:  Hai. 
[Mulan arrives on Khan jumping over the recent accident in the street and jumps off with hay stuck in her hair] 
Mulan: I'm here.  [Seeing a stern look from her mother] What?  But Mama I had to-- 
Fa Li:  None of your 'xcuses.  Now let's get you cleaned up. [They walk together into the preparation area] 
[Song: Honor to us all] 
Bath Lady:  [all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into the Bath] This is what you give me to work with? Well, honey, I've seen worse. We're gonna turn this sow's ear Into a silk purse. [Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing Mulan in the bath] 
Mulan [spoken]:  It's freezing. 
Fa Li [spoken]:  It would have been warm if you were here on time. 
Bath Lady [washing Mulan's hair]: We'll have you Washed and dried Primped and polished till you glow with pride Trust my recipe for instant bride You'll bring honor to us all 
Fa Li [grabbing a sponge and Mulan's right arm to start cleaning her.  She notices the writing] [spoken]:  Mulan, what's this? 
Mulan [Drawing her arm back and batting her eyelashes] [spoken]:  Ahh, notes, in case I forget something? 
Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Here, hold this [hands the cricket to Fa Li].  We'll need more luck than I thought.  [Mulan looks on with an air of disappointment] 
Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Not yet! An apple for serenity [putting an apple in Mulan's mouth]...A pendant for balance [places a yin-yang pendant under her sash] [sings] 
Beads of jade for beauty [putting beads around Mulan's neck] You must proudly show it [Grandma Fa raises her chin high with her hand] Now add a cricket just for luck [putting the cage with Cri-Kee under Mulan's sash in the back.  Cri-Kee doesn't look pleased] And even you can't blow it 
Mulan:  [Walking to catch up with the other maidens] Ancestors Hear my plea Help me not to make a fool of me And to not uproot my fam'ly tree Keep my father standing tall 
Maidens and Mulan: [Mulan taking the parasol from Fal Li and running to fall in line with the other 4 maidens] Scarier than the undertaker We are meeting our matchmaker 
All Townspeople: Destiny Guard our girls And our future as it fast unfurls Please look kindly on these cultured pearls Each a perfect porcelain doll 
Maiden #1:  Please bring honor to us Maiden #2:  Please bring honor to us Maiden #3:  Please bring honor to us Maiden #4:  Please bring honor to us Mulan and Maidens:  Please bring honor to us all! 
[All Girls and Mulan arrive before the Matchmaker crouched down behind their parasols.  End of song] 
Matchmaker [looking at her clipboard]:  Fa Mulan 
Mulan [Jumping up and raising her hand]:  Present. 
Matchmaker:  Speaking without permission. 
Mulan:  Oops. 
Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]:  Who spit in her bean curd? 
[Mulan walks into the Matchmaker's building with the Matchmaker following behind and closing the door] 
Matchmaker [looking over Mulan]: Huh, Hmm, too skinny.  [Cri-Kee escapes from his cage.  Mulan struggles to catch him] Hmph, not good for bearing sons. [Mulan puts Cri-Kee in her mouth when Matchmaker turns around to face her] Recite the final admonition. 
Mulan [nodding and smiling]:  Mmm-Hmm.  [Takes out fan and covers her mouth as she spits out Cri-Kee] Ptu 
Matchmaker:  Well... 
Mulan [with dignity]: Fulfill your duties calmly and re...f--[looking at her arm with smeared writing] spectfully.  Reflect before you snack [surprised, Mulan looks at her arm again] act.  [now rapidly] This shall bring you honor and glory.  [Fanning herself rapidly and sighing in relief] Huh. 
Matchmaker [snatches the fan and looks at it on both sides looking for notes not finding any.  Mulan smiles big when Matchmaker looks at her.  Matchmaker grabs Mulan's right arm pulling her along while smearing the writing and leaving some ink on her hand]  Hmmm, this way.  Now, pour the tea  [Pushing a teapot towards Mulan].  To please your future in-laws you must demonstrate a sense of dignity [Matchmaker smears ink around her mouth.  Mulan staring at Matchmaker pours some tea onto the table then notices her mistake and pours the tea into the cup] and refinement.  You must also be poised.  [Mulan notices Cri-kee in the tea-cup as Matchmaker takes the cup] 
[Grandma Fa clears her throat catching Mulan's attention and motions inside. Mulan spies the railing near the wall and climbs up to watch over the roof] 
Chi Fu:  Citizens  I bring you a proclamation from the Imperial City:  the Huns have invaded China! 
Townspeople [expressing surprise]:  No! 
Chi Fu:  By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the Imperial Army.  The Xiao family [a family member steps up, bows to the guard and takes the conscription notice from the guard].  The Yi family. 
Yi's Son [holding his old father back]:  I will serve the Emperor in my father's place. 
Chi Fu:  The Fa Family. 
Mulan:  No. 
[Fa Zhou gives his cane to Fa Li and walks toward Chi Fu.  Fa Zhou bows before the horsemen] 
Fa Zhou [standing proud]:  I am ready to serve the Emperor.  [Fa Zhou reaches for the conscription notice] 
Mulan [running outside to keep her father from taking the conscription notice]:  Father, you can't go. 
Fa Zhou [turning to see his daughter]:  Mulan! 
Mulan:  Please sir, my father has already fought bravely-- 
Chi Fu:  Silence!  You would do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue in a man's presence. 
Fa Zhou [looking away from Mulan]:  Mulan, you dishonor me. 
[Grandma Fa guides Mulan back away] 
Chi Fu [handing Fa Zhou the conscription notice]:  Report tomorrow at the Wu Shu camp. 
Fa Zhou:  Yes, sir. [Fa Zhou walks back into the homestead refusing to take his cane from Fa Li] 
Chi Fu [fading out as we follow Fa Zhou]:  The Chu family.  The Wen family. The Chang family.  The... 
Mushu [walking with a slouch and banging the gong on the ground]:  Just one chance is that too much to ask?  I mean, it's not like it'll kill ya. 
Mushu [rings the gong and looks at the Great Stone Dragon]:  Yo rocky, wake up!  You gotta go fetch Mulan.  [pauses as nothing happens.  Mushu walks over to the side of the statue] C'mon boy, go get her, go on, [throws the gong stick off the screen and whistles] Come on.  [Angrily while climbing up the Great Stone Dragon] Grrr, Grrrr.  [speaking in his ear and banging the ear with the gong] Hello, helloooooo. [curtly] Hello [bangs the gong extra hard against the ear causing it to break off].  Uh oh.  [The Great Stone Dragon crumbles to the ground, head intact minus the ear].  [knocks on the dragon's head] Uh, Stoney, Stooooneeey.  Oh man, they're gonna kill me! 
First Ancestor [calling out through the temple window]:  Great Stone Dragon, have you awaken? 
Mushu [holding the head of the Great Stone Dragon up to that First Ancestor can only see it's head and Mushu's body]:  Uhhh, Yes, I just woke up.  And I am the Great Stone Dragon, good morning [Mushu waves].  I will go forth and fetch Mulan.  Did, did I mention that I was the Great Stone Dragon? 
First Ancestor:  Go, The fate of the Fa Family rests in your claws. 
Mushu:  Don't even worry about it, I will not lose face.  [Mushu falls down the hill under the weight of the Great Stone Dragon's head and lands on the dragon's pedestal with the head falling on top of him] 
Mushu [muffled]:  Ow, my elbow.  Aw, aw, I know I twisted something. [Throwing the head off him]  That's just great.  Now what?  I'm doomed!   And all 'cause miss man decides to take her little drag show on the road. 
[Cri-Kee enters stage right] 
Cri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp. 
Mushu:  Go get her?   What's the matter with you?  After this great stone Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the temple.  Wait a minute, that's it!  I make Mulan a war hero, then they'll be begging me to come back to work.  That's the master plan.  Oh, you've gone and done it now. [Mushu runs off stage right] 
Cri-Kee [hopping along side of Mushu]:  Chirp.  Chirp Chirp Chirp. 
Mushu [pushing Cri-Kee away]:  Hey, what makes you think you're coming? 
Cri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp. 
Mushu:  You're lucky?  Ho, ho, heh.  Do I look like a sucker to you? 
Cri-Kee:  Chirp. Chirp. 
Mushu:  Whach' you mean loser?  How 'bout I pop one of your antenna's off and throw it across the yard.  Then who's a loser, me or you? 
[Interlude] 
[Cut to Shan-Yu leading his army at a charge on horseback through a forest. He stops and motions stage right.  Hun Archer, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Long-Hair Guy dismount and walk into the forest.  They throw down two Imperial scouts before the rest of the army] 
Mushu:  Get ready Mulan your serpentine salvation is at hand.  For I have been sent by your ancestors-- [notices Cri-Kee making a hand shadow of a dragon on the rock and stamps him down with his foot] to guide you through your masquerade.  [bending down to Cri-Kee]  C'mon, you're gonna stay you're gonna work. [returning to Mulan] Heed my word, 'cause if the army finds out that you are a girl, the penalty is death. [big flames shoot up from the rocks] 
Mulan:  Who are you? 
Mushu:  Who am I?  Who am I?  I am the guardian of lost souls. [Mulan smiles big in anticipation of seeing her guardian] I am the powerful, the pleasurable, the indestructible [coming out from the rocks to show his real size] Mushu! Oh hah, hah, pretty hot, huh? [Khan stomps on Mushu.  Mulan pushes Khan back] 
Mulan:  Ah, my ancestors sent a little lizard to help me? 
Mushu:  Hey, dragon, dragon,  not lizard.  I don't do that tongue thing [flips out his tongue to show Mulan what he means]. 
Mulan:  You're uh... 
Mushu:  Intimidating?  Awe inspiring? 
Mulan [making a hand gesture to denote his smallness of size]: Tiny. 
Mushu [with a look of disappointment]:  Of course.  I'm travel size for your convenience.  If I was my real size, your cow here [patting Khan on the nose] would die of fright.  [Khan tries to bite Mushu]  [pointing to the ground speaking to Khan] Down Bessy.  My powers are beyond your mortal imagination. For instance, [leaning in and looking at Mulan's chest] my eyes can see straight through your armor.  [Mulan cover her bust with her left arm and slaps Mushu with the right]  Ow.  [angrily] All right, that's it!  Dishonor! Dishonor on your whole family.  [aside to Cri-Kee] Make a note of this [Cri-Kee grabs a leaf and a pen and starts writing].  [Loudly with gusto] Dishonor on you.  Dishonor on your cow.  Dis- 
Mulan [pleadingly while covering Mushu's mouth]:  Stop!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry [kneeling down in front of Mushu].  I'm just nervous.  I've never done this before. 
Mushu: Then you're gonna have to trust me.  And don't you slap me no more, we clear on that?  [Mulan nods emphatically].  All right.  Okey dokey, let's get this show on the road.  Cri-Kee, get the bags [Mushu starts walking to the camp].  [to Khan] Let's move it heifer. 
[Cut to Mulan at the camp's entrance] 
Mushu [hiding in Mulan's armor poking his head out from her back]:  Okay this is it, time to show 'em your man walk.  Shoulders back,  chest high, feet apart, head up [Mushu pulls Mulan's head back]  ...and strut 2, 3, break it down, 2, 3 and work it, [Mulan walks into the camp drawing the attention the men who see her.  Mulan walks into a tent and sees a man picking his nose and another man picking out dirt from between his toes with chopsticks] Beautiful isn't it? 
Mulan [making a face of disgust and continuing to walk]:  They're disgusting. 
Mushu:  No, they're men.  And you're going to have to act just like them, so pay attention. 
[Mulan stops and watches Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and Tattoo Soldier] 
Tattoo Soldier [showing the dragon tattoo on his chest and belly]:  Look, this tattoo will protect me from harm. 
[Yao thinks for a moment, then punches Tattoo Soldier in the stomach causing Ling to laugh.  Mulan watches in utter amazement.  Yao kisses his hand] 
[Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away.  Ling kicks Yao on the butt causing him to land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling Jump attacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on top of Chien-Po] 
Ling:  You're dead.  [They fight on top of Chien-Po.  Mulan runs away.  Ling notices Mulan and then points toward her] Oh, there he goes. 
[Mulan runs into a tent and stops.  Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (in that order) run through the tent.  Yao stops short as he is about to run into a soldier in a line for food.  He looks behind him with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time.  Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the entire line of soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind it.  The men look to the back of the line and spy Mulan who has emerged from the tent.  They angrily start walking towards her.  Mulan has a look of horror on her face as if trouble is about to brew] 
Mulan:  Hey guys. 
[Chi Fu watches and then walks into the tent.  General Li and Li Shang are in the tent.] 
General Li [motioning with his pointer to a map of the region]:  The Huns have struck here, here and here.  I will take the main troops up to the Tung Shao Pass and stop Shan-Yu before he destroys this village. 
Chi Fu:  Excellent strategy, Sir.  I do love surprises, Ha ha, ha, ha. 
General Li:  You will stay here and train the new recruits.  When Chi Fu believes you're ready, you will join us...Captain. [General Li hands a sword to Shang] 
Shang:  Captain? 
Chi Fu:  Oh, this is an enormous responsibility, General.  Uh, perhaps a soldier with more experience-- 
General Li:  Number one in his class, extensive knowledge of training techniques, [leaning back smugly stroking his chin] an impressive military lineage.  I believe Li Shang will do an excellent job. 
Shang [excitedly]:  Oh, I will.  I wont let you down.  This is, I mean, I...[somberly] yes sir. 
General Li [gets up and starts walking out of the tent]:  Very good then.  We'll toast China's victory at the Imperial City.  [to Chi Fu] I'll expect a full report in three weeks. 
Chi Fu [to Shang]:  And I wont leave anything out.  [exits through the tent] 
Shang [while tying his sword to his uniform]:  Captain Li Shang, Hmmm, leader of China's finest troops.  No, the greatest troops of all time. Heh, heh, heh, heh.  [Shang walks out of the tent to see the recruits fighting.  He stands stage left of Chi Fu and General Li.  Injured Recruit sees the General and salutes him as he falls to the ground.  General Li steps over Injured Recruit and mounts his horse] 
Chi Fu:  Most impressive. 
General Li:  Good luck Captain.  [The general and his mounted troops leave the camp] 
Shang [quietly, to himself]:  Good luck, Father.  [Shang looks at his troops and sighs] 
Shang:  Mushu? 
Mulan:  No. 
Shang:  Then what is it! 
Mushu:  Ping! Ping was my best friend growing up! 
Mulan:  It's Ping. 
Shang:  Ping. 
Mushu:  Of course Ping DID steal my gir-[Mulan reaches back and grabs holds Mushu's mouth together] 
Mulan:  Yes, my name is Ping. 
Shang:  Let me see your conscription notice.  [Takes the notice from Mulan]  Fa Zhou, *the* Fa Zhou? 
Chi Fu:  I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son. 
Mulan:  Um, he...doesn't talk about me much.  [Mulan tries to hawk up a loogie and spit but the saliva just runs from her mouth.  The recruits laugh] 
Chi Fu:  I can see why, the boy's an absolute lunatic. 
Shang [to the recruits]: Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you'll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice.  And tomorrow, the real work begins. 
[All recruits growl at Mulan] 
Mushu [Popping out the front of Mulan's armor]:  You know, we have to work on your people skills. 
[Cut to Mulan sleeping in her tent.  Mushu winds up Cri-Kee's wings.  Cri-Kee rings like an alarm clock] 
Mushu: All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty.  [Mulan rises and blinks] C'mon [rapping on Mulan's head with each syllable] hup, hup, hup. [Mulan groans, lies back down and pulls the covers over her head.  Mushu pulls the covers off Mulan entirely]  Get your clothes on. Get ready.  Got breakfast for ya.  [Mushu jumps onto Mulan's knee with a bowl of porridge]  Look, you get porridge, and it's happy to see you.  [Mushu shows her the bowl with two eggs and bacon looking like a smiley face.  Cri-Kee pops up out from the bowl of porridge] Hey, get outta there, you gonna make people sick!  [Mushu uses chopsticks to push Cri-Kee out of the porridge] 
Mulan:  Am I late? 
All Soldiers [in agreement with Yao]:  Yeah. 
Shang [loudly]:  Soldiers!  [The soldiers line up quicky.  Shang takes off his shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows.  Mulan is duly impressed by Shang's physique] You will assemble swiftly and silently every morning. [Shang walks down the line of soldiers] Anyone who acts otherwise will answer to me. 
Yao:  Ooooo, tough guy. 
Shang [turning around with knocked arrow pointing towards Yao]:  Yao.  [All recruits take a step back leaving Yao one step forward.  Shang Points arrow skyward and shoots it into the top of a high pole]  Thank you for volunteering.  Retrieve the arrow. 
Yao [bows to Shang]:  I'll get that arrow pretty boy.  And I'll do it with my shirt on.  [Yao prepares to leap onto that pole] 
Shang:  One moment, you seem to be missing something.  [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.  Shang takes out one disk and holds it high speaking to all the troops]  This represents discipline  [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao's arm with it]  and this represents strength [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground.  The troops laugh while Mulan looks concerned].  You need both to reach the arrow. 
[Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight.  Ling, Chien-Po, and Mulan each take their turn and fall down.  Mulan rubs her behind as she walks away in front of Shang] 
Shang:  We've got a long way to go. 
[Song I'll Make a Man Out of You] 
[Shang throws staffs to the soldiers.  Yao intercepts Mulan's staff and trips her with it] 
Shang: Let's get down to business-- to defeat the Huns. 
[Shang throws up two clay pots and breaks them apart with his staff.  The troops are highly impressed] 
Recruits [putting their staffs out at arms length, spoken]:  Hua 
Shang: Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons?  [Ling puts a cricket down Mulan's back causing her to flail erratically] You're the saddest bunch I ever met  [Most soldiers fall as Mulan moves uncontrollably] But you can bet before we're through  [Shang does a somersault in the air landing near Mulan.  He takes a pole in the stomach.  Shang stops Mulan and takes her staff.  He grabs her by the collar] Mister, I'll make a man out of you 
[Shang steps on a lever throwing up 3 targets which he hits with 3 arrows from one bow] Tranquil as a forest [The recruits try and fail.  Mulan gets ready to fire when Mushu sticks a target on her arrow before she shoots.  Mulan looks at Mushu's in shock and pauses.  Shang looks disdainfully at Mulan as she cracks a huge smile] But on fire within [Shang balances a bucket of water on his head holding a staff.  The recruits fire stones at him which Shang deflect with the staff] Once you find your center You are sure to win [Mulan wobbles with the bucket of water on her head.  As the recruits throw stones at her the bucket tips over onto her head] You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot And you haven't got a clue [Shang throws his hand down into a river and retrieves a fish.  Mulan throws her hand down into the river and retrieve's Yao's foot.  Mushu comes out of the water with a fish in hand to give to Mulan] Somehow I'll make a man out of you! 
Chien-Po [running through a field of fire arrows]: I'm never gonna catch my breath 
Yao [following Chien-Po, falls and gets hit in the butt with an arrow]: Say good-bye to those who knew me 
Ling [Banging his head on a stone slab]: Boy I was a fool in school for cutting gym 
[End Interlude] 
[Cut to Mulan by the lake with Mushu, Khan, and Cri-Kee] 
Mushu:  Hey, oh, ah, no, this is not a good idea.  What if somebody sees you? 
Mulan [from behind the reeds]:  Just because I look like a man doesn't mean I have to smell like one. 
Mushu [holding a towel covering his eyes with his ears]:  So a couple of guys don't rinse out their socks, picky, picky, picky.  Well myself I kinda like that corn chip's smell. 
Mulan [running by Mushu and jumps into the lake splashing water on Mushu]:  Ahhhhhhh. 
Mushu:   Okay, all right, all right, that's enough.  Now, c'mon, get out before you get all pruny and stuff [holding out a towel towards Mulan keeping his eyes covered]. 
Mulan:   Mushu, if you're so worried, go stand watch. 
Mushu:  Yeah, yeah, [walking in a womanly fashion speaking in woman's voice] stand watch Mushu while I blow our secret with my stupid girly habits. [back to normal] Humph, hygiene. 
Cri-Kee [alarmed, tugging on Mushu's whiskers]:  Chirp, Chirp. 
Yao:  Me first! Me first! Me First! [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po run by Mushu smacking him in the face with colored boxers] 
Mushu [gasps]:  Ah.  We're doomed!  There a couple of things I know they're bound to notice! 
[Yao and Ling jump into the water.  Chien-Po dips in his toe to check temperature then jumps in causing a large wave.  Yao and Ling ride the wave towards Mulan.  Mulan sees them and hides her face behind a lily pad] 
Yao [calling]:  Hey, Ping. 
[Mulan peeks over the lily pad and spreads it on the water covering her chest] 
Mulan [speaking nervously and unnaturally in a manly voice]:  Oh hi guys, I didn't know you were *here*. [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po share "this boy is strange" looks] I was just washing, so now I'm clean and I'm gonna go.  Bye, bye.  [Mulan hides behind a rock keeping her front facing the rock] 
Ling [from behind Mulan]:  Come back here.  I know we were jerks to you before so lets start over.  [extending his hand to shake hands with Mulan]  Hi, I'm Ling! 
Mulan [covering her chest with her left arm, she turns and shakes his hand with an outstretched right arm, smiling]:  Heh, heh.  [Mulan turns and wades away from Ling and runs into Chien-Po] 
Mulan:  I never want to see a naked man again.  [the rest of the troops run by naked and jump into the lake] 
Mushu:  Hey, don't look at me.  I ain't biting any more butts. 
[Cut to Mulan outside Chi Fu's Tent having dressed fully.  Chi Fu and Shang are talking from inside] 
Chi Fu [fading in]:  You think your troops are ready to fight?  Hah!  They would not last a minute against the Huns. 
Shang:  They completed their training. 
Chi Fu:  Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be Captain.  Once the general reads my report, your troops will never see battle. 
Mushu [from outside the tent]:  Oh no you don't.  I've worked to hard to get Mulan into this war. [to Cri-Kee] This guy's messing with my plan. 
Shang [grabbing onto the front of Chi Fu's clip board]:  We're not finished. 
Chi Fu [pulling the board away]:  Be careful, Captain.  The General may be your father, but I am the Emperor's council.  And, oh, by the way, huh, I got that job on my own.  [opens the entrance to the tent for Shang] You're dismissed. 
[Shang storms out of the tent and starts to walk by Mulan] 
Mulan [in a manly voice]:  Hey, I'll hold him and you punch, heh, heh...  [Shang walks by without reacting] or not.  [calling out to Shang] For what it's worth, I think you're a great captain.  [Shang pauses to glance back, then continues forward] 
Mushu [looking at Mulan's fixed gaze on Shang]:  I saw that! 
Mulan [innocently]:  What? 
Mushu [teasing]:  You like him don't you? 
Mulan:  No, I-- 
Mushu:  Yeah right, Yeah sure.  Look,  [pointing to Mulan's tent] go to your tent.  [Mulan walks away with a look of delight. Mushu talks to Cri-Kee]  I think it's time we took this war into our own hands [rubbing hands together]. 
[Mushu and Cri-Kee wait outside Chi Fu's Tent.  Chi Fu emerges with carrying a scrub brush and wrapped in a towel and with big showering slippers on his feet.  He whistles as he walks off.  Mushu and Cri-Kee enter his tent.  Cri-Kee uses his legs to write up a letter.  He finishes and Mushu takes the paper] 
Mushu:  Okay, okay, let me see what you've got.  From General Li, dear son, we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would mean a lot if you'd come and back us up.  [sarcastically]  That's great except you forgot, "and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe you wouldn't mind bringing up some."  Hellooooo, this is the army!  Make it sound more urgent, please!  You know what I'm talkin' about?  [Cri-Kee starts writing the note again]  That's better, much better.  [taking the note] Okay, Let's go. 
Yao [lifting and lowering a woman over his head then opening his chest to show a gaping wound that we can see the woman through]: My girl will marvel at my strength, adore my battle scars 
Chien-Po [Chien-Po and a woman circle around then land on the edge of a large bowl of rice as a cow, pig and chicken fall beside them]: I couldn't care less what she'll wear or what she looks like It all depends on what she cooks like: Beef, pork, chicken... [end painted people section, the last image fades into statues that the troops just passed] 
All Three: Mmm... 
Yao [looking at Mulan while crossing the river with swords over their heads.  Mulan looks disgusted and hurries forward]: Bet the local girls thought you were quite the charmer 
Ling [with armor full of water to make him look muscular]: And I'll bet the ladies love a man in armor [the water leaks out making Ling look like his normal self] 
Army Chorus [Mushu whistles to ladies working in the rice field from out of the carriage holding cannons.  Cri-Kee looks shocked.  The ladies look and giggle at Mulan who hides her face]: You can guess what we have missed the most since we went off to war What do we want? A girl worth fighting for! 
Yao [Mulan walks away from Yao and into Chien-Po]: My girl will think I have no faults 
Chien-Po: That I'm a major find 
Mulan [Caught between Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po who all look up dreamily waiting for her ideal woman.  She is forced to speak (sing)]: [spoken] Uh, [singing] How about a girl who's got a brain,  [Yao starts to look unimpressed] Who always speaks her mind? [Mulan shrugs her shoulders] 
Ling, Yao and Chien-Po [disdainfully, looking disappointed and disgusted]: Nah! 
Ling [grabbing Mulan's shoulder and leaning on her, she takes his hand off and shakes her head disapprovingly.  Ling leans against the carriage of cannons]: My manly ways and turns of phrase are sure to thrill her 
Yao [hitting Khan so that the carriage runs out from under Ling.  Ling looks upset then falls in the mud]: He thinks he's such a lady-killer! 
Chi Fu: I've a girl back home who's unlike any other. 
Yao [aside to Mulan]: Yeah, the only girl who'd love him is his mother! [Mulan smiles] 
Army Men [lining up locking arms across each others shoulders with Mulan in the middle to her discontent]: But when we come home in victory they'll line up at the door! 
Ling [sitting on top of Chien-Po]: What do we want? 
Army Chorus: A girl worth fighting for! 
Ling: Wish that I had 
[Cut to Chien-Po with Ling standing on him and Yao standing on top of Ling] 
Chien-Po:  Do you see them? 
Yao [extatically]:  Yes! [Yao shoots an arrow with a rope attached]  Perfect!  Now I'll pull them to safe--[Yao grasps at air as the rope completely passed through his hands]--ty. 
[Cut to Mulan and Shang on Khan with Mushu and Cri-Kee riding up to her on his shield] 
Mushu [riding on the shield up to Mulan, Khan and Shang speaking loudly, above the noise of the avalanche]:  Hey Mulan, I found a lucky cricket. 
Mulan [speaking loudly]:  We need help!  [Yao's arrow lands near by Mulan and she picks it up and starts to tie the rope to Khan] 
Mushu [Getting off the shield and carrying Cri-Kee with him]:  Ooo, nice, very nice, you can sit by me.  [Mushu sees that they're about to fall over the cliff.  He and Cri-Kee look frightened] Ahhhhh!  We're gonna die!  We're gonna die!  I know we're gonna die!  No way we can survive this!  Death is coming! [Mulan knocks the arrow and shoots it toward Yao] 
Yao [crying]:  I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan's arrow lands in Yao's hands.  He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers grab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff] 
Yao:  Pull 
[Chien-Po prays as he calmly walks up to the group of soldiers.  He lifts them all up and pulls backward hauling Mulan, Shang, Khan, Mushu and Cri-Kee to safety] 
Mushu:  I knew we could to it.  You da man. [Mulan looks pleased] Well sorta. [Mulan grimaces] 
[The soldiers help them up to the cliff] 
Ling:  Step back guys, give 'em some air. 
Shang [catching his breath]:  Ping, you are the craziest man I've ever met.  And for that I owe you my life.  From now on, you have my trust. [Mulan smiles big] 
Ling:  Let's hear it for Ping!  The bravest of us all. 
Yao [lifting his arm high]:  You're king of the mountain! 
Chien-Po [jumping up and down]:  Yes, yes, yes! 
Mulan [beginning to stand up]:  Ahhh, [she clutches her right side] 
Yao, Ling and Chien-Po [rushing toward Mulan]:  Noooooo! 
Chi Fu [putting his hand to stop Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po from proceeding further]:  You know the law. 
[Shang stands over Mulan.  Mulan looks at Shang then bows her head in anticipation.  Shang lifts the sword high above his head and throws it down in front of Mulan] 
Shang:  A life for a life.  My debt is repaid.  [turns and walks towards the Imperial City]  Move out! 
Chi Fu [coming up to Shang's face]:  But you can't just... 
Shang [getting in Chi Fu's face]:  I said, "Move out!" 
[The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind with Khan, Cri-Kee, and Mushu.  Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes his blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and sits behind her.  Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs.  When he doesn't get warm, he moves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan.  Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick] 
Mushu:  I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  [Mushu picks up a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire] [glancing up] Hi. 
Mulan [look of sadness]:  I should never have left home. 
Mushu:  Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life.  Who knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all your friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go [looking as if he's about to cry]. 
Mulan:  Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror [picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in her helmet] I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek] 
Mushu [picking up the helmet and spitting on it]:  Well that's because this just needs a little spit, that's all.  Let me shine this up for ya [wiping the spit to clean the helmet and holding it up to Mulan].   I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.  [seeing Mulan is not cheered up by his actions, he shows sorrow on his face]  The truth is we're both frauds.  Your ancestors never sent me, they don't even like me.  I mean, you risked your life to help people you love.  I risked your life to help myself.  At least you had good intentions  [Mulan smiles]. 
Cri-Kee [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]:  Chirp, Chirp, Chirp.  Bawl, Bawl. 
Mushu:  What!?  What do you mean you're not lucky?  You lied to me?  [Cri-Kee nods] [to Khan]  And what are you? A sheep? 
Mulan [sadly]:  I'll have to face my father sooner or later.  Let's go home. 
Mushu:  Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty.  But, don't you worry, 'kay?  Things'll work out.  We started this thing together and that's how we'll finish. [Mushu hugs Mulan.  Mulan smiles]  I promise. 
[Cut to Shan-Yu's falcon flying over the avalanche site.  Shan-Yu's hand pops out of the snow.  He gets up and glances around] 
Shan-Yu [screaming]:  Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh! 
[Shang turns his horse and rides around Mulan and goes forward] 
Mulan [to Yao, Chien-Po and Ling]:  Keep your eyes open.  I know they're here.  Hya. 
[Mulan rides off and stops near the entrance to the palace, she dismounts Khan and runs into the palace yard] 
Mushu:  Now where are you going? 
Mulan [calling over her shoulder]:  To find someone who will believe me.  [Mulan runs into the palace yard] 
[Cut to the parade procession stopping in front of the Emperor on the steps of the palace.  Chi Fu stands next to Shang and gives him Shan-Yu's sword.  The Lion dancers stop behind Shang.  A palace man strikes a large gong and the people fall silent] 
Emperor:  My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom.  China will sleep safely tonight thanks to our brave warriors. 
[The crowd cheers] 
[Cut to Mulan at the fringe of the crowd] 
Mulan [approaching Man #1 laying her hand on his shoulder]:  Sir, the Emperor's in danger! [Man #1 rips his shoulder away from Mulan's touch and moves away] [agitated]  But the Huns are here!  [Mulan walks up to Man #2]  Please, you have to help me.  [Man #2 walks away from Mulan] [turning to Mushu who is standing near her in the yard]  No one will listen! 
Mushu:  Huh?  Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something? 
Mulan [irritatedly]:  Mushu! 
Mushu:  Hey, you're a girl again, remember? 
[Cut to Shang holding the sword before the Emperor] 
Shang [kneeling down giving the sword to the Emperor]:  Your Majesty, I present to you the sword of Shan-Yu. 
Emperor:  I know what this means to you, Captain Li.  Your father would have been very proud. 
[Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor.  The falcon rises above the roof and drops the sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles in the shadows blending in.  He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that all the people can see his face.  The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu.  Shang begins to draw his sword.  All 5 of Shan-Yu's men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry the Emperor into the Palace.  Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks his arrow retreating into the Palace to threaten would be rescue attempts] 
Shang [getting up and running toward the closing doors]:  No. 
Mushu [Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with wings spread like batman]:  You're worst nightmare. 
[Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward the ground] 
[Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up to the crest] 
Man in Crowd #1:  On the roof. 
Man in Crowd #2:  Look! 
[Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way.  Shan-Yu breaks through the roof behind Mulan surprising her.  Mulan backs away and searches for something on her person to help her against Shan-Yu.  She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it] 
Shan-Yu:  It looks like you're out of ideas. 
[Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through the fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that Shan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping off the fan with her sword movement] 
Mulan:  Not quite.  [calling out]  Ready, Mushu? 
Mushu [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]:  I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto a stick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework]  Light me!  [Cri-Kee lights the fuse] 
[Shan-Yu approaches Mulan.  Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in the face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground.  Mulan picks the sword back up and stabs it into Shan-Yu's cape.  The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.  Mulan lies flat down on the left side of the roof.  Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to run, but the sword has him pinned to the spot.  The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly propelling him toward the firework tower.  Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the rocket do the work.  Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail.  Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the roof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword] 
Mulan [while running]:  Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof. 
[The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks to fly everywhere.  Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof.  Propelled by the explosion, she grabs onto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down.  She looks down and releases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the ground.  Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by] 
Mushu [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the fireworks]:  Ah ha ha ha ha.  [Mushu's catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [to Cri-Kee]  You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee's antenna] 
Chi Fu [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned]:  That was a deliberate attempt on my life.  Where is she?  Now she's done it.  What a mess.  [Shang and troops push Mulan behind them to protect her] [to Shang] Stand aside, that creature's not worth protecting. 
Shang [in Chi Fu's face]:  She's a hero. 
Chi Fu:  'Tis a woman.  She will never be worth anything. 
Shang [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]:  Listen, you pompous-- 
Mulan [smile turning into disappointment]:  Oh, thank you.  [Mulan walks toward Khan] 
Shang: [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself]:  Hmm. 
[Mulan mounts Khan] 
Mulan:  Khan, let's go home. 
[Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground level.  The crowd cheers al the while.  The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat] 
Emperor [to Shang]:  The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all. 
Shang [dumbfounded]:  Sir? 
Emperor:  You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty.  [The emperor puts on his hat and walks back up the steps to his palace] 
[Cut to Mulan's home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree.   A blossom falls and lands on his leg.  Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father.  Fa Zhou sees her approaching and starts to stand] 
Fa Zhou:  Mulan. 
[Mulan quickly moves in front of her father and kneels causing him to sit back down] 
Mulan:  Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest of the Emperor [hands the crest to Fa Zhou].  [with head bowed] They're gifts to honor the Fa Family. 
[Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of Mulan. He bends down and holds her arms outstretched] 
Fa Zhou:  The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter.  [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan's tear then hugs Mulan]  I've missed you so. 
Mulan:  I've missed you too Baba. 
[Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway] 
Fa Li [sighing]:  Ahhhhh 
Grandma Fa:  Great, she brings home a sword.  If you ask me she should have brought home a ma--[leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang]

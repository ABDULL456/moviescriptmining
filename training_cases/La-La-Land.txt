LA LA LAND 
Written by 
Damien Chazelle 
FADE IN... 
A sun-blasted sky. We HEAR radios -- one piece of music after another... 
We're -- 
1    EXT. 101 FREEWAY - DAY 
Cars are at a standstill. It's a horrific traffic jam. 
Morning rush hour. Sun beating down, asphalt shimmering in the heat. The blown-out downtown L.A. skyline hovers in the distance. 
We DRIFT past more CARS. Hear one snippet of audio after another... 
One driver taps his steering wheel to PROG ROCK. Another sings to OPERA. A third raps along to a HIP-HOP track. We move from a RADIO INTERVIEW to a FRENCH BALLAD to TECHNO, until finally we begin to hear... 
...a new, original piece of music... [ANOTHER DAY OF SUN] 
We settle on the CAR from which this new tune is playing. The driver is a YOUNG WOMAN. She hums along to the riff on her radio -- then starts SINGING. 
Then -- she EXITS her car. Then -- she starts MOVING down the lane. 
One by one, more DRIVERS join her -- SINGING and DANCING along. Without a single cut, we've found ourselves in a FULL- FLEDGED MUSICAL NUMBER... 
Drivers leap on car-tops, dance Jerome Robbins-style, making use of the road and the hot gleam of the automobiles. Arms swaying, feet banging, dancers darting, as the MUSIC blasts. We WEAVE and SWIRL and DART between and around the cars, taking the magic in... 
Finally -- all the drivers swing back into their vehicles -- and the song comes to a dramatic stop. 
Flash title card: 
WINTER 
A1   We settle on a new car. A 1983 Dodge Riviera. In it is SEBASTIAN, 32, L.A. native. He's listening to the radio. He's playing a track on his music system -- a tape of Thelonious Monk's "Japanese Folk Song". But he keeps stopping it, over and over and over -- always rewinding to the same exact spot. Revision                           2. 
B1   OMIT 
C1   We DRIFT from his car to one further up ahead. A light-green 2005 Prius. Inside is MIA, 27, Nevada-raised. Six years of "no" in L.A. have toughened her, but she's still a dreamer. She seems to be on the phone, speaking into her car's system. Fast, fiery, full of energy -- 
MIA ...and I swear to God, she was wrecked. It was pure insanity. 
Mia stops. Thinks. Mutters to herself: "Insanity"... Then leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger seat. It's a SCRIPT. 
MIA (CONT'D) (reading now) Pure lunacy. Oh God, I know... 
Just then -- the traffic around Mia starts to let up. She's too focused on her lines to notice. 
Then -- a long, sustained honk behind her: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. 
Mia comes to. Jerked back to reality. The honking car behind her swerves into the next lane. It's Sebastian. Mia gives him the finger. We then FOLLOW her as she drives...

4    INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Mia works, photos of Hollywood icons on the wall behind her, as -- 
CUSTOMER #1 This doesn't taste like almond milk. 
MIA Don't worry, it is. I know sometimes it -- 
CUSTOMER #1 Can I see the carton? 
8   WE CUT TO: Mia in the BATHROOM. Just showered, wrapped in a towel. She hums to herself. 
The mirror is fogged up. She turns off the vent. The mist on the glass thickens. She dabs some of it away. Dims the lights. Looks... 
With the fog in place, her reflection looks like one of those soft-focus old Hollywood close-ups. She hums as she brushes her hair... 
Then -- the door SWINGS open -- and the spell is broken. 
TRACY Holy Mother of God. 
Mia snaps out of it. Turns. Fog is enveloping TRACY, 27. 
TRACY (CONT'D) Ever heard of a vent? 
MIA I wanted to give you an entrance. 
ALEXIS (appearing in the hall, 26, eating Cheetos) Mia! How'd it go? 
MIA Eh... 
ALEXIS Same here. Was Jen there? Or Rachel? 
MIA I don't know who Jen and Rachel are. 
ALEXIS They're the worst. 
MIA I don't know if they were there. 
As Mia slips away -- 
ALEXIS I bet they were. Revision                           6. 
CAITLIN (appearing, 27) Why is there a convention in the bathroom? 
TRACY Two minutes, people! Mia you're coming, right? 
WE PAN TO find Mia poking her head out of her bedroom -- 
MIA Can't. Working. 
TRACY (O.S.) What? (we PAN BACK to Tracy) Did she say "working"? 
A8   We follow Mia INSIDE her room. She closes the door. Takes a moment. You can tell in her eyes -- work or not, a night on the town is the last thing she wants to do now. 
B8   WE CUT to the HALLWAY, to find Tracy POUNDING on Mia's door. 
MIA (opening up) Yes? 
TRACY Look, I know things didn't go well today. There are four things in my inbox that you're perfect for and I will submit you. But right now -- you're coming. 
C8   With that -- she barges in and beelines to Mia's closet -- 
TRACY (CONT'D) It'll be fun. 
MIA It'll be a bunch of social climbers packed into one of those glass houses. 
TRACY Exactly. Fun. 
She pulls out a blue dress. As Alexis hurries in -- 
TRACY (CONT'D)                        MIA This looks familiar.             I was going to give it back! 
Alexis moves from Mia's perfume to the dress, lighting up as she grabs it -- Revision                           7. 
ALEXIS Come on, Mia. When else do you get to see every Hollywood clich√© crammed into a single home? 
TRACY (faux-offended) Lex! I'm disappointed in you. There's nothing to make fun of. This party will be humanity at its finest. 
Mia rolls her eyes -- and, with that --

19    EXT. HILL / LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT 
Mia trudges down the steep hill in her unwieldy heels. She's an hour-and-a-half walk from her place. She crosses roads and lots, navigates stretches where the sidewalk stops and gives way to shrubbery. 
A19   And then -- she hears something... Music. A piano, in the distance. And a MELODY -- one we will come to know very well... 
Without being sure why, she FOLLOWS THE SOUND. Passes several doors. Then stops. Has found where it's coming from... 
She reaches out -- and slowly opens a door... 
AND WE CUT RIGHT BACK TO: 
20    EXT. 101 FREEWAY - EARLIER THAT MORNING 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. The same 101 traffic jam we began with. This time we're on Sebastian -- the honker. 
He passes Mia's car. She gives him the finger. He drives on, shaking his head... 
21    OMIT 
22    EXT. RAYO'S - MOMENTS LATER 
Sebastian sips a coffee as he gazes across the street -- at a 30's Deco building. A sign above the door: "VAN BEEK". A newer sub-heading below: "TAPAS & TUNES". Revision                          10. 
The door opens. Two EMPLOYEES step out, setting up a valet stand. Sebastian watches them -- and shakes his head. The employees notice him. Recognize him. What is it with that guy...? 
23A   OMIT 
23    INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Sebastian enters his apartment -- cramped, dingy, bare walls, no furniture or decoration, boxes filled with dusty black-and-white photographs and unused instruments on the floor, a black Steinway upright piano in the center of the living room -- and sees a WOMAN rummaging around. 
SEBASTIAN You gotta stop breaking into my home. 
She looks up. She's 37 quickly going on 50, and dressed like she doesn't care. This is LAURA, Sebastian's older sister. 
LAURA You think Mom or Dad would call this a home? 
Seeing that she's seated on a stained, decrepit stool -- 
SEBASTIAN Please don't sit on that. 
LAURA Are you serious? 
SEBASTIAN Yes. Hoagy Carmichael sat on that stool. The Baked Potato was gonna throw it away. 
LAURA I wonder why. (then, rising,) I brought you this. It's a throw rug. 
SEBASTIAN Don't need it. 
LAURA Yeah? What if I told you Miles Davis pissed on it? 
SEBASTIAN That's almost insulting... (then,) Did he? Revision                        11. 
She shakes her head: Unbelievable. Tosses the rug to the side. 
LAURA When are you going to unpack these boxes? 
SEBASTIAN When I unpack them in my club. 
He keeps playing, louder now, and we're --

26    OMIT 
27    INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A red-booth bar-and-restaurant. Christmas decorations all over. Sebastian steps in. Immediately beelining over -- 
BOSS Seb. 
SEBASTIAN (putting on a smile) Bill. Thanks for having me back. 
BOSS Your welcome. Stick to the set list. Revision                       14. 
SEBASTIAN Of course. (under his breath as he heads to the piano) Though I don't think they care what I play. 
BOSS I do, and I don't want to hear the free jazz. 
SEBASTIAN How `bout one for you, one for me? Or two for you, one for me? (the Boss just glares) Or all for you, none for me? Ok, that works. Good deal. 
Sebastian sits down at the keys. A WAITRESS passes by. 
WAITRESS Well... Welcome back. 
SEBASTIAN There's a nice way to say that. 
With that -- he starts playing "Jingle Bells". 
28   INT. RESTAURANT - LATER 
The restaurant's demographic has changed. It's now younger stragglers wandering in. Sebastian looks beyond bored. He finishes "We Wish You a Merry Christmas". Zero applause. 
He begins a new chart: "Deck the Halls". But something seems to come over him now. He's restless. Slowly, his playing drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path... 
And then -- we hear a melody. The one Mia heard outside. The one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song... 
The door opens -- and Mia steps in. She sees Sebastian at the piano. Is instantly struck by his playing. [MIA AND SEBASTIAN'S THEME] 
Gradually -- all sounds but the music drop out. We drift away from reality. Even the walls seem to go slightly darker -- as though Sebastian and Mia were all alone... He concludes his piece with a jumble of chords, his playing almost free jazz now, as we pull back to real life... 
...and see the Boss looking on in scorn. Revision                        15. 
Sebastian finishes. Silence. Mia looks like the wind has been knocked out of her. Sebastian looks up for a second -- and sees her. They look at one another. Just a moment. 
Then -- the Boss taps Sebastian on the shoulder. WE STAY ON Mia as she watches Sebastian rise with the Boss. We just see the Boss talking to Sebastian, can't hear what is said. Then, we get closer -- and realize: 
BOSS ...every goddamned night. 
Sebastian is silent. Then, doesn't want to have to beg but -- 
SEBASTIAN I'll stick to the set list, I promise -- 
BOSS Too late. You're done. 
SEBASTIAN You're not gonna find a better player. You know that. 
BOSS (leans in, and --) Do you think anyone here gives a shit? 
With that, the Boss walks off. We linger on Sebastian. Anger giving way -- to hurt. He starts hurrying toward the door. 
BACK TO Mia -- who didn't hear what was said. She watches Sebastian -- takes a breath, so moved that she's about to lay it all out -- swoops in to corner him -- and -- 
MIA I just wanted to say -- I saw your playing, and I -- 
MIA "Curt"? 
SEBASTIAN Ok I was an asshole. I can admit that. Revision                       18. 
MIA Ok. 
SEBASTIAN But requesting "I Ran" from a serious musician -- it's too far. 
MIA My God. Did you just call yourself "a serious musician"? 
SEBASTIAN (beat) I don't think so. 
MIA Can I borrow what you're wearing? 
SEBASTIAN Why? 
MIA Because I have an audition next week. I'm playing a serious fire-fighter. 
SEBASTIAN (irritation building --) So you're an actress. That makes sense. Have I seen you in anything? 
MIA Uh... The coffee shop on the Warner Brothers lot. That's a classic. 
SEBASTIAN Oh, you're a barista. Well now I see how you can look down on me from all the way up there. 
SINGER (popping in from nowhere) Sebastian. Second set. 
Sebastian looks at Mia. She smirks. Pleased. The Singer walks off. 
SEBASTIAN He doesn't tell me what to do. 
MIA He just told you what to do. 
SEBASTIAN I let him. Revision                          19. 
A beat. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) What's your name? 
MIA Mia. 
SEBASTIAN Mia. Guess I'll see you in the movies. 
He heads back to the keys, and the band resumes: 
SINGER Never seen you lookin' so lovely as you did tonight... 
36   EXT. PARTY / STREET - NIGHT 
The party's finished. Sebastian exits, pulling out his keys, as we DRIFT and see a long line to the VALET. Standing way in the back, waiting, is Mia. She's stuck once again with CARLO, who's regaling her -- 
CARLO ...Goldilocks from the point of view of the bears. Home-invasion thriller. Fox and Warners are going crazy for it. 
Mia spots Sebastian, passing by the Valet with his keys. 
CARLO (CONT'D) ...We're going after Charlize. For the bear. We're flipping it. Feels like a franchise. But the thing is it's grounded. 
MIA (to Sebastian) George Michael! 
Sebastian stops. Looks at her. Surprised. 
SEBASTIAN You again. 
MIA Did you just get your keys? 
Sebastian thinks. Sees the Valet. Playing it off -- 
SEBASTIAN ...Yeah. Revision                       20. 
MIA Can you grab mine? 
MIA (CONT'D) Honestly, I wish I loved something else. I've tried so hard to want other things. 
She and Sebastian stop. Peer inside the stage. 
MIA (CONT'D) I left school after two years to come here, my fourth manager just dropped me, and my last audition was for a teen soap pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O.C. (a beat; then, deadpan --) Should've been a lawyer. Revision                        27. 
They resume walking. 
D40   CUT TO: A row of closed soundstages, sandy-tan against the bright blue sky. 
SEBASTIAN ...`Cause the world needs more lawyers. 
MIA Well it doesn't need more actresses. 
SEBASTIAN You're not just an actress. 
MIA What do you mean, "just an actress"? 
SEBASTIAN You said it yourself, you're a child- prodigy playwright. 
MIA That is not what I said. 
SEBASTIAN You're too modest to say it but it's true. So you could write your own roles. Write something that's as interesting as you are. 
MIA Last thing I wrote was a stand-up routine for an open-mic night. It was horrible. 
SEBASTIAN All I'm saying is -- Louis Armstrong could have played the marching-band charts he was given. What did he do instead? He made history. 
MIA Ok, I'll stop auditioning and make history instead. 
Sebastian laughs. 
MIA (CONT'D) Anyway -- I'm getting a feeling there's something I should tell you... 
SEBASTIAN Yeah? Revision                       28. 
MIA I hate jazz. 
Sebastian stops. Turns to her. 
SEBASTIAN What does that mean? "I hate jazz"? 
MIA It means when I listen to it I don't like it. 
SEBASTIAN But it's such a blanket statement. It's like saying "I hate animals". 
MIA I do hate some animals. 
SEBASTIAN Do you need to be anywhere right now? 
Mia looks at him. We hear DRUMS. A swinging ride pattern. And we're in -- 
41   INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - DAY 
-- an old-school JAZZ CLUB. It's almost empty, only aged JAZZ CATS here -- except for Mia and Sebastian, watching a QUARTET... 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Most people say they hate jazz because they don't have context. They don't get where it came from. All these people packed into flophouses in New Orleans, speaking five different languages, and jazz was how they talked to each other. 
MIA I thought it was just Kenny G. 
SEBASTIAN ...What? 
Mia looks at him. Already knows just how to get to him. 
MIA I associate it with facials. It's relaxing. 
SEBASTIAN It's not relaxing! Sid Bechet got into a gunfight `cause somebody told him he played a wrong note! Revision                           29. 
MIA (laying it on thick) Right, but it's good to talk over. Where I grew up there's this jazz station they'd play at cocktail parties whenever they served the salami and cheese. 
...and begins to SING. [CITY OF STARS] Lifted by a strange new feeling -- a feeling he wasn't expecting. The feeling that perhaps -- just perhaps -- he's falling in love... 
He gazes out at the sea, the purple sky. Dances with an OLD COUPLE, then continues on his way, as though caught in a dream. There's an uncertainty in his singing -- he's not sure if this dream will sustain. But for now, it's a beautiful feeling... 
The MUSIC simmers down -- and WE FADE OUT. 
45   EXT. AUDITION BUILDING - DAY 
A Pasadena building. As Mia approaches the door, another cell ring. It's her MOM. This time, Mia is happy to get the call: 
MIA (CONT'D) Hi, Mom! 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Hi, sweetie. How are you? 
MIA Great, actually: I got a call-back on a pilot. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oh my God! You're going to be on TV?? 
MIA Well -- it's not picked up yet. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Not picked up? 
MIA First they make the pilot, then if they like the pilot it goes on TV. Revision                           32. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) And you're in the pilot? 
MIA Well, no, I have a call-back. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... Didn't you audition for a TV thing last week? 
MIA It's another audition. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) I see... So you might get a role in a thing that might one day be put on TV... 
MIA ...Well when you put it like that it sounds like a huge accomplishment. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) No, I don't mean that, it's so exciting. What channel? ABC? HBO? 
MIA Oxygen. 
MIA'S MOM (O.S.) Oxygen? 
MIA You know what, I have to go. I love you. 
She hangs up. Takes a deep breath. Enters the building. 
46   INT. WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Mia sits, starts reviewing her script. 
Looks around her -- the room is filled with ACTRESSES silently MOUTHING THEIR LINES. It's a bizarre sight: a dozen women moving their mouths, with no sound coming out at all. 
What's more, they're all in variations of the same type of costume: Michelle Pfeiffer's leather jacket from Dangerous Minds. 
A few stare at Mia, sizing her up. In the corner, another one of them GRUNTS while performing stretches. Then -- a DOOR to the side opens, and Mia can hear -- 
DIRECTOR (O.S.) ...We'll be seeing you very soon. Revision                        33. 
An ACTRESS exits. Absolutely beaming. And then, a bored voice -- 
ASSISTANT Mia Dolan? 
47   INT. AUDITION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Mia steps in. The pilot's DIRECTOR is seated at a table, looking in his folder at Mia's head-shot. He looks up at Mia. 
DIRECTOR Whenever you're ready. 
Mia breathes in. Heart pounding. Sweat percolating. Has been practicing this for days now. 
FIANCEE Probably work. 
JOSH Yeah, I'll have to call you back. (closes and pockets his phone) So, yeah, we love it. 
Awkward silence. Mia hasn't spoken a word. 
52   EXT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 
Sebastian paces. People shuffle in. He looks. No sign of Mia. 
53   INT. JAR - NIGHT 
Midway through the meal. 
Mia is bored, restless, uneasy. 
JOSH (CONT'D) One word for you. Nicaragua. 
GREG I've never heard anyone say that. Was it amazing? Revision                          36. 
JOSH Oh my God. A five-star jungle eco-resort. It was unbelievable. 
Mia stays quiet, in her own thoughts, the voices around her fading away. And then she hears it -- coming from the restaurant speakers, peeking out subtly at first: the melody we now know so well... Her and Sebastian's song. 
She FREEZES. The radio music seems to have morphed into the melody, and the tune stirs something deep within her... 
A few seconds pass. And then she can't deny it any longer. It's clear as day to her now. She rises from her seat -- 
GREG Mia? 
-- looks at Greg -- 
MIA I'm sorry. 
-- and -- as the sounds of a FULL ORCHESTRA swoop in -- 
-- RUNS out of the restaurant as fast as she can. 
54   EXT. JAR - NIGHT 
The MUSIC SWELLS, strings carrying us through and lifting Mia's spirits as she runs down the street in her green dress, for once absolutely sure of what she's doing... 
55   INT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 
Inside the Rialto, Sebastian settling into his seat, the show about to begin. He's visibly disappointed that he's alone. The lights dim. Projector light cuts through the darkness. And then, as the movie's credits start up, Sebastian spots, out of the corner of his eye, a figure in the aisle... 
He looks. The figure turns. Looks at him. It's Mia. 
And, caught like a freeze-frame in the projector   light, her green dress incandescent, the giant movie screen   behind her like a great piece of back-projection, she looks   more beautiful than ever right now. A true old-fashioned screen   siren. 
Sebastian's eyes go wide. He's surprised. And thrilled. He waves. Mia hurries toward him. Takes the seat next to his, as Rebel Without a Cause begins... Revision                           37. 
56    INT. RIALTO MOVIE THEATER - LATER 
Half an hour has passed. The movie plays, lights flickering on Mia and Sebastian's darkened faces. 
He puts his arm on the armrest, she moves hers nervously. 
He scoots to his right, she scoots back. 
She edges her elbow onto the armrest, he moves his arm. 
Inch by inch, their bodies grow closer. Hands approaching, breaths quickening, hearts pounding... 
...until finally their hands touch... 
And then, suddenly -- just as James Dean and Natalie Wood arrive at Griffith Observatory, and Mia and Sebastian seem about to kiss -- 
-- burn marks streak their way across the image. 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. 
HONKING outside the nearest window. It's a honk we recognize: 
TRACY ...Is that gonna happen every time? 
MIA (glowing) I think so. 
A60   OMIT 
61    EXT. MIA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Mia dashes out -- and LEAPS into Sebastian's car and into his arms. They KISS -- giddy, emotional, as though they'd been separated for years. Sebastian drives off -- when -- 
MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) It's one-way!! 
The car SCREECHES to a stop in front of a TRUCK going the opposite direction. Sebastian goes into REVERSE as Mia cracks up laughing. A BURST OF MUSIC as a title card pops on: Revision                          40. 
SUMMER 
The MUSIC carries us through the following series of GLIMPSES: 
62    -- Mia and Sebastian ambling past weathered 30's bungalows in BUNKER HILL... 
63    -- Mia guiding Sebastian down a street peppered with SILENT- ERA HOMES, past old gas-lamps and palms... 
65    -- VAN BEEK. Sebastian gestures to the "TAPAS & TUNES" sign. Excitedly tries to deface it. Mia, aghast, pulls him back... 
66    -- The HUNTINGTON GARDENS, where Mia and Sebastian gaze at the tiny forest... 
A66   -- WATTS TOWERS, where the two lovers stroll and kiss... 
67    OMIT 
64    -- The GRAND CENTRAL MARKET, where they grab food... 
68    -- ANGEL'S FLIGHT at night, where they stumble and slip into a tipsy, love-soaked dance... 
69    OMIT 
Interspersed throughout, WE SEE IMAGES OF LOS ANGELES: 
1940's high-rises, green movie-movie lettering, ochre walls shaded by palm fronds, red flowers and Spanish missions, old lamps and Art Deco hotels. It's a gorgeous city, and the music only makes it more gorgeous -- building and carrying us to... 
70    INT. LIGHTHOUSE CAFE - NIGHT 
A Lighthouse JAM SESSION. Sebastian's at the keys, having a blast. The place is again mostly empty, but Mia is dancing her heart out. She shoots looks at Sebastian. He laughs, plays out for her. The two of them are in their own world -- one of pure, unadulterated JOY... 
The song ends. Sebastian rises, joins Mia. They sit down as the band strikes up a new tune, and kiss. 
KEITH (O.S.) Sebastian? 
Mia and Sebastian look up, startled. A YOUNG MAN, 35, is standing next to them. Tall, fierce eyes. This is KEITH. 
SEBASTIAN Keith? Revision                       41. 
KEITH Holy shit. Come here, man. 
Sebastian gets up. Gives him a hug. But Mia can sense an unease in Sebastian's eyes. It's a strained hug. 
SEBASTIAN This is Mia. Mia, Keith. (explaining to Mia) We used to play together. 
KEITH                           MIA Hey, Mia.                         Hey... 
Sebastian sits back down. Wants to end the conversation. 
KEITH So how've you been? 
SEBASTIAN Great. You? 
SEBASTIAN You don't get it. Charlie Parker got the name "Bird" because he loved chicken. So my club's gonna be old-school jazz and beer and chicken. "Chicken on a Stick". 
MIA No. Drop the chicken. Drinks and jazz. (he rolls his eyes) And it's time to start looking for other places. 
SEBASTIAN It's gotta be Van Beek. I can't let them samba all over its history. 
MIA Make your own history. 
Sebastian looks at her. Appreciates that line. A beat. Then -- 
SEBASTIAN Your play's incredible. 
Mia smiles. He approaches her, sits by her side. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) The whole world from your bedroom? Who's doing that? Revision                    44. 
MIA I'm doing that. 
They laugh. 
MIA (CONT'D) So who was that guy at the Lighthouse? 
SEBASTIAN ...Which guy? 
MIA The one who offered you a gig. 
SEBASTIAN You mean Keith? He's the worst. 
MIA Why was it weird between you two? 
SEBASTIAN It's always weird with him. 
MIA He did offer you a job. 
SEBASTIAN Right... 
MIA Are you going to call him? 
SEBASTIAN No. 
A beat. 
MIA Ok... 
A moment passes. They lie down, side by side. 
SEBASTIAN Here's what we know. It's definitely Chicken on a Stick -- (Mia rolls her eyes) -- and your play is going to be a triumph. 
She looks at him. He looks at her. A shared smile. 
And on that -- Revision                       45. 
72   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - MORNING 
The next morning. Sebastian is in bed. Hears snatches of Mia's voice -- she's on her phone in the other room: 
MIA (O.S.) ...No, Mom, it's a one-woman show... No, I'm acting in it as well... No, I'm not getting paid, I'm paying to do it... (then,) He's great... He's going to open his own jazz club. It's going to be incredible... (beat; then, softer --) Well he has to get the money together first, and... He's figuring it out... Yeah, it's just been a little tricky lately... 
Sebastian listens. Takes it in. 
MIA (O.S.) (CONT'D) Look -- he's going to find a way to open it and you're going to love it. Ok? How's Dad? 
On Sebastian. He thinks... 
73   INT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 
Sebastian enters. Keith's combo is assembled. 
It's a sign-up practice room in the West Valley. There's a drummer, electric bassist, and trumpeter: COLE, MALCOLM and TOM. They're more polished in their looks than Sebastian. Well-groomed beards, tighter jeans. 
CLOSE on Mia. She looks tired. A bit weathered. She's nursing a green tea across from Laura. They've finished eating. 
LAURA Look at him -- watch -- 
Mia glances out the window. A MAN in his early 40's has just parked, is walking around his car, inspecting it. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Now he's going to check the other window. Yep, it's closed. Now he's going to check again. Yep, still closed. 
Mia smiles. The MAN enters the restaurant -- greets Mia -- and kisses Laura. This is HARRY. Her new boyfriend. 
HARRY Hey. I'm grabbing some pastries, you two want anything? 
MIA Thanks Harry, I'm good. Revision                       52. 
LAURA Same here but I think someone's trying to break into your car. 
Harry rolls his eyes, heads to the front. Laura looks at Mia. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Don't stress about the play. Where's Seb now? 
MIA I think today's San Diego. I'm not sure... 
A moment passes. 
LAURA You should come over tonight. Harry's cooking, but don't let that stop you. (Mia manages a smile; a beat) What's the matter? 
MIA Nothing... 
LAURA You miss him. 
MIA I guess. I'm adapting. 
LAURA (nods; then,) I got used to being alone. Growing up it was just me and Seb. We only had each other. 
MIA He told me. 
LAURA I wasn't looking for anybody. Then I met Harry and -- we just fit... (Mia smiles) You've changed Seb. You know that? 
Laura means it positively -- but Mia seems concerned... 
MIA Do you think he's happy? 
LAURA Is he happy? 
MIA I mean with the band, the travel, all of it. Revision                        53. 
Laura shrugs. 
LAURA Our dad never got to do what he wanted. We were always treading water, he took a job running a washer-dryer store. But every night at home he'd play his clarinet along to a Benny Goodman record. (a beat) So I look at Sebastian... Playing music, getting paid for it. I'm happy for him. 
She notices Harry through the window, returning. Her thoughts drift. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Dreams change. 
A beat. She looks back at Mia. Sees her worry. 
LAURA (CONT'D) Don't overthink it. He'll be home soon. 
Harry rejoins the table. Hands Laura a sponge cake. 
LAURA (CONT'D) I told you not to get me anything! 
HARRY Oh, right -- I'll eat it I guess. 
LAURA No -- I changed my mind. 
They laugh. Kiss. Tender. Loving. Mia watches... 
94   INT. DINER - NIGHT 
MIA To Boise? Revision                     56. 
SEBASTIAN Yeah, you could knock that off your bucket list. 
Mia laughs. 
MIA Wish I could. 
A beat. 
SEBASTIAN Why can't you? 
MIA Come to Boise? 
SEBASTIAN Yeah. 
MIA Because I have to rehearse. 
SEBASTIAN Can't you rehearse anywhere? 
She looks at him. 
MIA You mean anywhere you are? 
SEBASTIAN ...I -- I guess... 
MIA Well, all my stuff is here and my show's in a few weeks and -- I don't know, it doesn't seem practical... 
SEBASTIAN Right... I just -- we're going to have to do things so we can see each other. We never see each other. 
MIA I know, but when are you done? 
SEBASTIAN ...What do you mean? 
MIA When are you done with the tour? Revision                   57. 
SEBASTIAN But -- as soon as we're done with the tour we go back and record, and then we go back on tour. 
Mia looks at him. Doesn't seem to understand. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) We tour so we can make the record, and then we go back on tour to sell the record. 
Beat. Mia takes this in. 
MIA So it's...the long haul? 
SEBASTIAN ...What does that mean? 
MIA I mean the long haul -- like, you're going to be in this band for a long time. 
SEBASTIAN What did you think I was going to do? 
MIA I don't know, I didn't think the band would -- 
SEBASTIAN You didn't think we'd be successful. 
MIA No, that's not what I meant. What I meant was -- this band -- you're going to be on the road for -- what, years now? 
SEBASTIAN Yeah, feasibly -- I could be on the road for years with just this record. 
Beat. 
MIA Do you like the music you're playing? 
SEBASTIAN I don't know how that matters. 
MIA It matters if you're going to give up your dream to be on the road for years. Revision                    58. 
SEBASTIAN Do you like the music I'm playing? 
Sebastian rises, springs toward the kitchen -- then sees Mia grabbing her things. 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) Wait -- 
But she's out the door. It slams shut, as Sebastian pulls the burnt apple pie from the oven. 
And on that -- WE SMASH CUT TO -- 
97   OMIT 
98   EXT. THEATER - DAY 
A poster, placed on the front of the theater we saw before. A title. A name below it: "MIA DOLAN." And a word: "TONIGHT." 
We spot Mia, carrying a box of props. She enters the theater. And we're -- 
99   INT. THEATER - DAY 
The empty theater. Dark. Silent. Then -- a light turns on. Mia steps in. We stay WIDE. She seems small from this vantage point, surrounded by her props and backdrops. She takes a moment. Looks at all the empty seats. Revision                       61. 
Takes a deep breath. Nervous. And then, nodding to herself -- you can do this -- she starts setting up... 
100   INT. PRACTICE SPACE - DAY 
A BLAST of music. The Messengers have just finished a rehearsal. Sebastian packs his stuff, heads toward the exit, nodding to the others -- 
SEBASTIAN                          COLE See you tomorrow.                 See ya. 
-- when -- 
KEITH You good for tonight, right? 
Sebastian stops. Looks at Keith. 
SEBASTIAN ...Tonight? 
KEITH Seven. The photo shoot. (reading Sebastian's face, adding --) Mojo. 
A beat. Sebastian is confused. 
SEBASTIAN I thought that was next Thursday. 
KEITH No. It's tonight. 
We linger on Sebastian for a moment... 
KEITH (CONT'D) Is that ok? 
101   EXT. REHEARSAL SPACE - DAY 
Sebastian stands out front. Checks his watch. Thinks... 
102   OMIT 
103   INT. THEATER / INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 
People are shuffling into the theater. We DRIFT BACKSTAGE. Mia, now in a male suit and tie, watches behind a curtain. Checks her phone. 7:04. Breathes in. Nervous, and alone... 
She turns. Nods to the OWNER, off to the side. He heads to a switch, and the lights GO DOWN. Revision                        62. 
You can hear the murmurs beyond the curtain. The audience, expecting. Mia tries to get her nerves under control. She can do this... Sets her phone aside -- one last breath -- 
-- and walks out. 
104   OMIT 
105   OMIT 
106   INT. PHOTO STUDIO - NIGHT 
SEBASTIAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry -- 
-- and KISSES her. The kind of kiss that might once have swept her off her feet. He starts to move with her... 
...starts to DANCE -- but -- 
MIA Stop -- 
She pulls away. Steps back. Sebastian looks at her. Unmoored. 
SEBASTIAN I'm -- I'm sorry I missed it -- and I'm sorry I was a dick and I -- I promise I'll make it up to you -- 
MIA It's over. 
She doesn't say the words with any anger. Just acceptance. 
SEBASTIAN (a beat; then --) ...What do you mean? 
MIA I'm done embarrassing myself. 
SEBASTIAN You didn't embarrass yourself... Revision                     65. 
MIA No one showed up. I can't even pay back the theater. 
She says this as though just realizing it. Sebastian looks at her. A moment passes. He doesn't know what to say now. 
MIA (CONT'D) I'm gonna go home for a while. 
SEBASTIAN ...This is home. 
MIA Not anymore. 
Sebastian is silent now. A tear in his eye. He clenches his jaw. Mia looks at him one more time, steps into her car, and drives off. 
Sebastian lingers. Doesn't move. Silence. Then, music. Soft, melancholy, just piano, as... 
111    OMIT 
A111   OMIT 
...WE DISSOLVE TO: 
112    OMIT 
113    EXT. MIA'S CAR - DAY 
Mia drives, boxes stacked in the back. 
A113   She gets on the 405... Heading out of the city... 
114    EXT. / INT. MIA'S HOUSE - NEVADA - DUSK 
Mia steps inside a modest house. Her MOM is by the door. Hugs her. Her DAD stands by the hallway. 
115    INT. MIA'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DUSK 
Mia enters her old bedroom. Slides in a suitcase. Moves a couple of boxes from the hall. Looks around. Old photos. Old soccer trophies. She sits down on the bed. Takes a breath. And, finally, we're... 
116    EXT. ORANGE GROVE - DAY 
Laura and Harry's ENGAGEMENT PARTY. We're outside, in a sun- dappled grove. A small gathering. Revision                       66. 
Sebastian plays a baby grand piano -- the source, we realize, of the music we've been hearing... 
As he watches   Laura dance with her new fianc√© -- this woman he has known for   so many years as a romantic cynic, now once again full of   all the youthful innocence of first love -- his thoughts seem   to drift. The music comes to a close and... 
117   LATER: Sebastian with Laura, by the orange trees... 
LAURA You remember the McKenzies? 
MIA I'm ok. 
MIA'S DAD You look hungry. 
MIA I'm good... 
A moment. Mia's Dad puts a few more dishes away, then sits back down across from her. 
MIA'S DAD It's fun having you back. Your mom ditches me at ten. 
Mia laughs. A moment. 
MIA You took down the swing. 
MIA'S DAD She made me. 
A smile. 
MIA'S DAD (CONT'D) I've still got all your old tapes. 
MIA Oh God. Throw those away. 
MIA'S DAD Never. 
Just then -- a loud, persistent HONK. Mia's Dad looks up, eyebrow raised. Mia turns, hearing it as well. The HONKING is nearby -- just outside... 
Mia's thoughts suddenly sharpen. Ears perk up. She's heard the honking before: Revision                         69. 
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHT. 
MIA'S DAD (CONT'D) What the hell...? 
Disbelief on Mia's face. It can't be. She heads to the nearest window. There -- at the corner, smack-dab in front of her house -- is SEBASTIAN'S CAR. 
A NEIGHBOR angrily yells at him. Sebastian sees Mia. They lock eyes. And on that -- 
120   EXT. MIA'S HOME / SEBASTIAN'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER 
Mia and Sebastian stand next to his car. 
MIA Why did you come here? 
SEBASTIAN Because I have good news. 
MIA Ok... 
SEBASTIAN Amy Brandt. The casting director. 
MIA I know who she is. 
SEBASTIAN She was at your play. And she loved it. And she loved it so much that she wants you to come audition for a huge movie she's got. 
He's brimming over with excitement. But Mia just shakes her head. 
MIA I'm not going. 
SEBASTIAN ...Excuse me? 
MIA I'm -- no... That will kill me. 
SEBASTIAN That's it? 
MIA Yes. Revision                    70. 
SEBASTIAN So you're happy here? 
MIA I'm happier. 
SEBASTIAN Why won't you come? 
125   INT. WAITING LOBBY - DAY 
Mia and Sebastian are seated. Waiting. The DOOR opens. An ACTRESS exits. A second later -- 
ASSISTANT #2 Mia? 
Mia gathers her nerves. Gets up. And steps in. 
126   INT. AUDITION ROOM / INT. LOBBY - DAY 
In the room is AMY BRANDT -- mid-forties. Seated behind her is the director, FRANK. 
AMY BRANDT                       MIA Hi, Mia.                        Hi. 
AMY BRANDT I'm Amy, this is Frank. Glad we found you. 
Mia nods. Smiles. A moment. 
AMY BRANDT (CONT'D) The movie shoots in Paris. There's no script. Revision                        73. 
FRANK We want to build the character with you. It's a process. Three-month rehearsal, four-month shoot. 
MIA ...Ok. 
AMY BRANDT So why don't you just tell us a story? 
MIA ...About...? 
AMY BRANDT About anything. 
Mia nods again. A moment. 
AMY BRANDT (CONT'D) Whenever you're ready. 
Mia thinks. She takes a breath -- then goes silent again. It seems she might be unsure what to do, might even be about to choke the audition. We fear she may botch this completely... 
A126   WE CUT TO THE LOBBY -- to Sebastian, hearing Mia's silence. On edge... Worried... 
B126   WE RETURN to the AUDITION ROOM... Brandt and Frank waiting... 
MIA My aunt lived in Paris for a bit... She used to tell me these stories, when I was growing up, about living abroad... (beat) I remember -- she told me she jumped into the Seine once... 
She pauses, and then continues -- in SONG. [TRACK: AUDITION] 
Yes, this audition is different than the rest, and the switch to song signals just that. Mia's nerves fade away -- all the accents and fakery of earlier auditions a distant memory. This is Mia undisguised -- pure and stark and beautiful... 
She uses the story of her aunt jumping into the river to paint a portrait of all the dreamers in the world -- all the people who are told they're nuts for pursuing their passion -- all the so-called "fools" who take the plunge. She sings about them and for them. This is why Mia does what she does -- why she simply has no choice... 
The song ends, and we linger on her for a moment. Then... Revision                     74. 
...WE DISSOLVE TO: 
127   EXT. GRIFFITH PARK - DAY 
Mia and Sebastian sit on a bench, the Observatory perched behind them. The clouds have parted, and it's now a gorgeous Los Angeles afternoon, minutes before dusk. 
Sebastian looks at Mia. A moment passes. 
SEBASTIAN When do you find out? 
MIA They said the next couple of days... But I'm not expecting to find anything out. 
SEBASTIAN You're going to get it. 
MIA No, I'm not. 
SEBASTIAN You are. I know these things. 
A beat. 
128   EXT. STUDIO LOT - DAY 
We're on a studio lot, looking at one of the old painted backdrops, of a palm tree and sky. A new title card: 
Five years later... 
We TILT down to the studio's entryway. A CAR enters. 
A WOMAN steps out. We don't see her face. We FOLLOW her from behind. She walks elegantly, poised. The wind picks up a strand of her hair. She makes her way down side-streets we've seen before, past Parisian-style fa√ßades. Then enters a COFFEE SHOP we recognize... 
129   INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
The eyes inside all look the WOMAN's way. She reaches the counter -- and we finally SEE HER FACE: 
MIA Hi... Iced coffee, please. 
MIA looks different. Different haircut, different way of handling herself. 
The BARISTA hurries to get Mia's order. We recognize this as the shop where Mia used to work. A man who appears to be the NEW MANAGER gives Mia the coffee -- Revision                      77. 
NEW MANAGER On us. 
MIA No, no, that's fine. 
Mia hands over a few dollar bills. Then drops another bill into the tip jar. The Barista smiles. 
130   EXT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER 
Mia exits the coffee shop...and is met by a CREW MEMBER on a GOLF CART. She gets on the cart -- and is driven away... 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON hands on piano keys, fluttering across the ivories. We PULL BACK: it's SEBASTIAN. We're in... 
131   INT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY 
...a small jazz club. Simple, tasteful, cool. Stone arches in 1940's style. The seats close to the band, the piano in the center. The club has the same old-school character as the Lighthouse -- but it's not run-down. It's polished, inviting. 
The place is empty save for Sebastian and an EMPLOYEE. It's before-hours. Sebastian finishes playing. Feels out the lowest keys once more, then the highest. Then turns and -- 
SEBASTIAN Alright, I'm done. (gets up) Harris did a nice job with it. 
EMPLOYEE Took him long enough. 
Sebastian smiles. 
SEBASTIAN No one touches the instruments. Carson's coming an hour early to test levels. 
EMPLOYEE I got a check for you to sign. 
SEBASTIAN How'd we do last month? 
EMPLOYEE Not too bad. Revision                          78. 
SEBASTIAN (as he signs the check) Not too bad is great. (taps the Employee on the shoulder) See you tonight. 
EMPLOYEE See you tonight. 
132   EXT. CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY 
Mia pulls into the driveway. 
133   INT. ROOM - CHATEAU MARMONT - DAY 
She steps inside. Flowers and cards. We glimpse cursive "CONGRATULATIONS" written on a few of them. A stack of scripts on a nearby table. Her name visible. She drops her things, spots someone, goes in to kiss him. A long, tender, loving embrace, as we pull back... 
...and see that it's not Sebastian. 
It's a MAN we haven't seen before: DAVID, mid-thirties. He and Mia kiss again. And, running over and grabbing Mia's leg, is a TWO-YEAR-OLD GIRL...

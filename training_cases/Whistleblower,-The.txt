1   BLACKNESS...                                                    1 
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN) I can't see anything... Are you there? 
Silence. 
GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D) Are you there!? 
Giggling. LUBA, 15, dangerous, flicks a lighter, sparking a cigarette, and grins in the flickering flame. 
LUBA (UKRAINIAN) God I'm drunk... Where's this damn door? 
She scans the space with the lighter. Illuminating... 
RAYA (UKRAINIAN) Watch it! That's my hair! Let me try. 
RAYA, 15, pretty, guileless, takes the lighter, searching... CLICK. She has it. They BURST out the door, LAUGHING, onto... 
2   EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT                       2 
A PARTY. ROCK MUSIC BLARES. DRUNK TEENS dance around BURNING BARRELS. GROUPS lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes skulling cans, making out, talking shit. A BOY, 17, lights a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL and hurls it off the roof. 
Luba and Raya join THREE GUYS. ONE of them pisses onto a cloth, stuffs it in a bottle, and tries to light it. It FIZZLES. Everybody bursts out laughing. 
RAYA (UKRAINIAN) It's ammonia, not alcohol. 
BOY (UKRAINIAN) (Drunk) You're so smart. I love you! 
He lunges in for a kiss, but she dodges him, laughing. Luba gives him the finger, pulling Raya toward the dancing into... 
TEEN MAYHEM: Raya lets herself go. She gets lost in... 
A WHIRL of drunk and happy teens. It's tribal. They dance, silhouetted against the fire and the black sky, their backs to the run-down Soviet buildings... Tonight, they don't want to think about what life holds in store. 
Raya stops. Dizzy. She looks at her watch, suddenly aware of the time. Yelling over to Luba... TWB 2. 
RAYA (UKRAINIAN) I have to get home. Mama's gonna kill me. 
LUBA (UKRAINIAN) No, you're staying with me tonight. Roman wants us there at 9 in the morning. 
Raya looks at Luba. Torn. 
LUBA (CONT'D) It's just a few months working in a hotel. You want to work at Copyshack like your mother? Marry one of these assholes? There's nothing here!.. He said it was both of us or no go! 
Raya sighs, wanting to, but unable to agree. Luba hesitates; she needs this so badly. 
LUBA (CONT'D) Fuck your mom! 
But Raya shakes her head, eyes apologetic. She pushes past Luba who watches her disappear. 
3   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - LATE NIGHT                       3 
Raya tiptoes through a modest apartment when.... The lights come on. Raya turns back to see HALYNA, 35. Her face torn between anger and relief. 
RAYA (UKRAINIAN) I know I'm late. I tried to leave, but-- 
HALYNA (UKRAINIAN) It's three in the morning. 
Halyna shakes her head, disappointed. Then turns off the lights. Raya stands alone as Halyna goes into her bedroom. SLAM. Raya looks around the apartment, it's poverty, it's measly aspirations... 
4   EXT. KYIV - MORNING                                             4 
The silver mist of dawn rises over the Golden Domes of Kyiv. 
5   INT. APARTMENT - KYIV - MORNING                                 5 
Raya sits on a stool before a WHITE WALL. Luba smokes a cigarette. ROMAN, 40, smiley, fixes a camera to a tripod. 
ROMAN (UKRAINIAN) Big smile! TWB 3. 
Luba reads a SWISS HOTEL BROCHURE, then looks up. 
LUBA (UKRAINIAN) (practicing) I am Natalya Verbova. I am going to Budapest to buy carpets for re- selling. I am staying two days... 
Raya sees ZENIA, 30, peeking in the door. Raya smiles. Zenia, nods, demure. Roman looks through the camera. 
LUBA (CONT'D) No-one's gonna believe we really did it! 
Luba beams at Raya, who can't hide her own excitement. 
CAMERA POV: Raya looks into the camera. Her face lights up with hope... FLASH... The IMAGE FREEZES... We BURN TO WHITE. Then the title of the film fades in... 
"THE WHISTLEBLOWER" 
A FLASHLIGHT cuts across... 
6   EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - LINCOLN, NEBRASKA - NIGHT                   6 
HAWK Just think about it, will you? 
He leaves, passing Erin, who pushes down tears. Kathy eyes Erin, full of love, but not knowing what to say. 
9   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER                                         9 
Erin stares out the window. Kathy watches her, concerned. 
ERIN I wish you could stay here. 
KATHY Me too. 
Erin turns. Serious. Weighing... 
ERIN I mean it's fine living at dad's, but... Now I really won't see you for a while. 
KATHY I'm doing this for us. If I have a better job, I can give you guys more. 
Erin nods, tearing again. 
ERIN When do you have to decide? 
KATHY Come here. 
Erin moves over, hesitant. Kathy pulls her in to a hug, wincing slightly in pain. But keeps a brave face. TWB 7. 
ERIN Are you sure it's not dangerous? 
KATHY Of course. It's been four years. Things are getting back to normal over there. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
A BOMBED OUT building, sprayed with RED GRAFFITI. DEBRIS everywhere. Torn clothes. A SIGN. Cyrillic letters: 
SARAJEVO - 3 KM. 
Sprayed across it in red: TURN AROUND! 
10   EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                                        10 
A SILHOUETTE breaks the horizon and SPEEDS towards us, throwing up gravel: a dented white BUS, emblazoned with large black letters: "UN". A UNITED STATES flag on it. 
TITLE CARD: BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA 1999 
11   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                         11 
Kathy sits in a bus full of BLUE BERETS. She looks out the window, her eyes drinking it all in... 
VOICE (O.S.) You come here today as a beacon of hope, as representatives of humanity's highest aspirations. 
In the opposite direction, a U.S. MILITARY TANK ROLLS past. A SOLDIER looks out from the HATCH. 
Kathy turns to see the only other woman on the bus, Carmen, 20s, Latina. She smiles cheekily, giving Kathy the `peace' sign. Kathy smiles. IMMEDIATE SOLIDARITY. 
In the opposite direction, two other UN BUSES pass, one flanked by a CANADIAN FLAG, the other with a FRENCH TRICOLOR. 
The bus cranks around the corner, entering... 
12   EXT. SNIPER ALLEY - CONTINUOUS                                12 
The final stretch into Sarajevo. Famous from so many war reports, site of many deaths. The broad, pock-marked avenue is barren. SHELLED HIGH RISES lean like hungry faces, gouged from their once-solid structures. Living rooms are exposed to the elements, wallpaper blowing in the wind like torn skin. TWB 8. 
IN THE BUS: Carmen taps Kathy, pointing out the window... 
CARMEN Sniper Alley. See, the bullet marks are at eye level. People just running to the store. 
All the walls are splattered at head level. Kathy is overcome by the stark reality of war. Worse than she ever imagined. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
MOVE ALONG rapt faces... YOUNG MEN, MIDDLE-AGED MEN, heads held high, ready for anything. We're in... 
13   INT. MEETING HALL - LATER                                      13 
BILL HYNES paces before the assembled NEW RECRUITS. He's in his 50s, distinguished and seemingly in charge... 
BILL HYNES You have been hired by Dyncorp Aerospace International to represent the US as monitors for the United Nations, which means you are the only national contingent coming from a private military. So you people chose to come here. And for the next few weeks, we will teach you how to protect the rule of law in a war zone, how to rebuild a civil society brick by brick... 
MOVING OVER more RECRUITS... On their laps, "DYNCORP" ORIENTATION FOLDERS. MEN, listening, determined... 
14   EXT. OUTLYING SUBURB - DAY                                     14 
Kathy and RECRUITS receive TRAINING from a PAKISTANI MONITOR, shadowing him as he hands food-packs to a LINE of REFUGEES. 
BILL HYNES (O.S.) ...to ensure the dignity, equality, and inalienable human rights of every single person in this devastated place. 
The refugees turn their haunted eyes to the fresh faces of the NEW RECRUITS. Kathy extends a parcel to an OLD MAN. He hesitates. Then she sees... He has no arms. She's unsure what to do. A young boy takes the package, leading his grandfather away. Kathy stands: WHERE AM I? 
ASSEMBLY HALL: Bill Hynes stands before a map of the Balkans. TWB 9. 
BILL HYNES (CONT'D) The Dayton Peace Accords of 1995 ended this war, dictating that an International Police Task Force - YOU - would smooth the transition from war to peace. 
15   EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF SARAJEVO - DAY                               15 
KATHY and THREE NEW RECRUITS are led down a path along a mountainside. They move toward an UNDERGROUND BUNKER. CHILDREN play at the edge of an overgrown field. 
AT THE BAR 
Kathy moves to Todd and the Americans, catching Todd's eye, but is distracted by a WAITRESS writhing on an ITALIAN SOLDIER's lap. The Waitress darts Kathy a look, contemptuous. And the soldiers notice. One leers at Kathy... 
ITALIAN SOLDIER I'd pay double for a woman in uniform. 
Kathy looks him over. 
KATHY Sorry pal, I'm not for sale. 
The Soldier is stung. The Italians laugh. 
TODD MYERS (O.S.) We're Dyncorp. We're all for sale... Kathy, right? 
Todd puts his arm around Kathy, bringing her to a TABLE OF AMERICAN IPTF. They greet her, friendly. 
TODD MYERS (CONT'D) Look the basic lay of the land is we have to work with the other nationals, but we don't mix with them at night. 
JIM HIGGINS, 25, and even younger looking... 
JIM HIGGINS Lucky those wops don't carry guns or we'd've had ourselves a situation. Fucking unarmed mission. I was hoping we'd get to squeeze some off. 
TODD MYERS At who? Better odds you'll step on a land mine and what the hell's a gun gonna do for you then? 
JIM HIGGINS (embarrassed) I'd kill the fucker who buried it. 
Everyone laughs. Todd turns to Kathy. TWB 13. 
TODD MYERS You ever had to take someone down? 
KATHY Just once. 
The others see she's the real deal. Kathy feels good. 
23   INT. PATIO BAR - LATE NIGHT                                   23 
Kathy moves through the now-hopping bar. She's ready to leave. She searches for... Carmen. She's IN A CORNER. Still with the group of DUTCH OFFICERS. 
Kathy approaches, concerned, when Jan cuts her off. He's watching Carmen, who's teetering, drunk. 
JAN You should probably get her home. 
KATHY You probably shouldn't have let her drink that much. 
Kathy moves past him, irritated. But he grabs her. 
JAN Hey. I... don't worry. I know those guys. Nothing was going to happen to her. 
Kathy shrugs, it doesn't mean much to her. 
JAN (CONT'D) I was hoping you'd come back. 
KATHY Well I did. And now we're both leaving. 
24   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                       24 
Early sun breaks through the fog over the valley. 
25   INT. DORM - KITCHEN - MORNING                                 25 
Kathy tries to work the Bosnian coffee maker, a confusing relic. Carmen comes in, holding her head. 
CARMEN What the hell happened last night? 
Kathy smiles, pouring her a cup of the tar-like brew. They both look at it, a little scared. Kathy eyes the clock. TWB 14. 
KATHY Let's move. We're gonna be late. 
26   EXT. STREET - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - DAY                             26 
Industrial plants dominate the skyline of this Sarajevo suburb. Kathy drives frantically past bombed-out buildings. Carmen studies a map beside her. They hit A RED LIGHT. And stop. A GROUP OF MUSLIM WOMEN cross the street. One questions Kathy with a lingering gaze. Carmen stares at her map... 
CARMEN Do you have any idea where we are? 
Kathy shakes her head. No idea. 
27   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER                            27 
A run-down prefab office, with dated 80s equipment. A couple of small offices off the open center. 
Kathy and Carmen rush in. An IPTF OFFICER stands waiting for them... Jan Van Der Velde. 
JAN Late night ladies? 
They eye him, embarrassed. He hands them each a thick binder. 
JAN (CONT'D) I'm your duty officer. You check the duty roster. Every day. You're each assigned to monitor and instruct a group of Bosnian local police. We work in six week shifts. You instruct in the mornings, then go into the field with them in the afternoon. One of you needs to go now. 
He eyes an eager Kathy. Carmen shrugs. 
JAN (CONT'D) They're waiting at the 5th canton. Out the gate, then left, left, park, right... 
Kathy rushes off, then stops. Jan tosses a set of keys. 
JAN (CONT'D) My van. There's a map in front. 
No answer. Clarkson looks to Kathy to take control. She turns to her group, but they have even less respect for her. She goes to speak, when... VIKO, 25, looks up, hesitant. TWB 18. 
VIKO (BROKEN ENGLISH) I will take it. 
The cops turn. Clarkson unclicks his pen. Viko sees Kathy, hungry for support. But Danik scoffs. 
DANIK (BOSNIAK) (At Zlata) Tze ye yiyiy vuna. 
Zlata's face tightens. Viko turns to Danik, angry.... Kathy looks to Clarkson, who gives her nothing. 
KATHY What did he say? 
VIKO She is Muslim. He said she deserved it. 
CLARKSON Alright, that's it. Everyone out. 
KATHY (at Clarkson) Isn't she filing a complaint? 
The other cops eye Kathy, defiant. This is our turf. 
Clarkson ushers the cops out. Kathy catches Viko's eye. Simpatico. Then follows the other out. Kathy looks back at Zlata, who lies helpless. 
33   INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER                       33 
Clarkson leads the group. Kathy pushes up toward him. 
KATHY She has to file a complaint. A woman gets stabbed in the face and there are no repercussions? 
Clarkson pulls Kathy aside. Viko stares. 
CLARKSON Quit it! You hear me? 
Kathy reddens. The local cops look over. 
CLARKSON (CONT'D) We are not investigators. We are monitors. You don't know a Serb from a Croat or a Bosniak. You've got ethnic hatreds that started a war. This isn't just policing, it's diplomacy. TWB 19. 
Kathy blushes, feeling like a chastened schoolgirl. 
CLARKSON (CONT'D) We don't run the show, we make sure the show runs smoothly. 
34   INT. BEDROOM - IPTF DORM - EVENING                             34 
Kathy sits up in bed reading from her Dyncorp/UN manual. She flicks, not finding what she's looking for. Carmen comes out of her room, dolled up for the evening. 
CARMEN Come out. You can't solve this tonight. I'm not taking no for an answer. 
35   EXT. LOCAL CAFE - SARAJEVO MARKET - NIGHT                      35 
Kathy has dinner with Carmen, who talks away. Kathy watches the world go by. She notices an OLDER, LARGE IPTF MONITOR walking with his arm around a YOUNG GIRL, 16, dressed in a short skirt. Kathy turns back to Carmen who is still talking. 
36   EXT. SARAJEVO - MORNING                                        36 
Chanting echoes from the SINANOVA HOUSE of the Dervish Order. 
37   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MORNING                                  37 
Viko comes in, scanning over IPTF MONITORS. Spotting Kathy. 
38   INT. ILIDZA STATION - MOMENTS LATER                            38 
Viko lays down a pile of files. Zlata's picture on top. 
VIKO Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital eight time because of her husband. Every time she try to file a complaint, my bosses send her back. They always laugh at the woman... They laughed at my mother. They do not make prosecutions of domestic violence. I want to get enough evidence to do this. 
Kathy isn't sure. She looks around, almost guiltily... 
VIKO (CONT'D) This is why you are here, no? 
Kathy looks at him, struck by the truth of this. She takes the files, flipping through them. Thinking... TWB 20. 
KATHY With no police reports?.. Maybe, if you go back to the hospital... You can pull the records for every one of her visits. 
39   INT. FILE ROOM - HOSPITAL - DAY                               39 
A HOSPITAL ADMINISTRATOR, who hands Viko a stack of files. 
40   EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY                                           40 
Kathy sits in a UN SUV. Viko watches as she goes through Zlata's hospital files. She's encouraged. 
KATHY Okay, now get the same thing from all the doctors who treated her. They will have to testify on Zlata's behalf. 
41   INT. LAW LIBRARY - EVENING                                    41 
Viko and Kathy sit behind a pile of Legal Books. Viko shows Kathy a page, a questioning look on his face. 
KATHY This is good. Let's cross reference each injury with other cases where felony assaults were ruled. Can you get something like that? 
Viko turns to see a LIBRARIAN at the main desk. 
KATHY (CONT'D) ... Because if stabbing someone in a bar is illegal then the same standard can be applied to a domestic assault. 
42   INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY                                         42 
Viko sits behind Zlata and COUNSEL while a JUDGE rules. 
CARMEN Hey, where've you been? 
KATHY I'll tell you about it over a drink. Could you just check something for me? I want to get a copy of the monitor's report from a raid on the Florida Bar yesterday. 
Carmen nods, and clicks on her computer. 
CARMEN Your job is so exciting. The only thing I get to raid is the fridge. (Reading off the computer)... You sure there was a raid? There's no record here. 
KATHY No. That's definitely it. There were six girls removed from the bar and I need to know where they were taken. TWB 36. 
CARMEN Sorry. No record of any raid. 
Kathy thinking. Something's not adding up. 
66   INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - UNMHQ - MORNING                         66 
Kathy walks. MONITORS greet her as she passes. She reaches an OFFICE, and knocks. 
KATHY I'm looking for Fred Murray? 
67   EXT. MINE FIELD - BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - DAY                    67 
FIVE local MEN in fatigues scan the field slowly with hand- held minesweepers. One MAN holds up his hand as his device BEEPS. At the edge of the field, Fred Murray blows a whistle. Everybody else STOPS. The man bends down, as all wait... 
Kathy approaches from the road, behind a fence. Fred smiles. 
FRED MURRAY We meet again! 
Kathy looks out, suddenly aware of the dangerous situation. 
KATHY Is it okay for me to be here? 
FRED MURRAY Sure, sure. You're fine here on the gravel. What's going on? 
KATHY I just wanted to follow up with you on the raid yesterday. Those girls didn't show up at the Shelter, and I wanted to locate them. 
FRED MURRAY Yeah, the whole thing was a bit of a mess. Turned out it was a local police mistake. Mix-up with the tip off or something. Thought they had a prostitution bust, but the bar is legit and those girls were just waitresses. 
KATHY Waitresses aren't kept under lock and key. 
ANOTHER WHISTLE BLOWS. Fred turns to the field. TWB 37. 
FRED MURRAY Shit. Can we go over this later? I got to get in there. 
Before she can answer, Fred is moving down the field. She watches him go. 
68   EXT. WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - DAY                              68 
Kathy and Milena lead Raya and Irka out to her SUV. 
69   EXT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - DAY                          69 
A stark contrast, the GDA is a new and shining edifice. Kathy's SUV pulls up front. 
70   INT. GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY - MOMENTS LATER                70 
Kathy and the girls sit in the waiting area. The place is modern, western... corporate. In platinum base relief over the reception desk: 
GLOBAL DISPLACEMENT AGENCY. 
The LOBBY. Magazines on a coffee table. The wall adorned with a HUGE FRAMED POSTER of a young girl in a spiderweb. A caption: "TRAFFIKU ZHINOK YE SPRAV. 1999" 
Kathy scans the hall. Endless posters. 1998, 1997, 1996... 
LAURA LEVIN, 30s, American, groomed, business-like, comes around the corner. Her ASSISTANT, 20s, leads the girls away. 
KATHY Kathy. The new Head of Gender Affairs. 
LAURA LEVIN I heard. Laura Levin. My assistant will take them to the medical center. As soon as they get medical clearance we'll know where we stand. 
KATHY What do you mean? 
LAURA LEVIN Well, it's yet to be determined if they'll cooperate with the repatriation program. That's the only way I can allow them to stay at the GDA. TWB 38. 
KATHY They're critical... witnesses for a situation I'm... monitoring. I'll need to speak with them when they're ready. 
LAURA LEVIN I understand. I'll be in touch. 
KATHY Will you be contacting their parents? 
Laura nods. Something still on Kathy's mind... 
KATHY (CONT'D) The other girls from the raid were supposed to go to the Women's Medica Shelter, but they never showed up. Do you have any idea where else they might have been taken? 
LAURA LEVIN I didn't know there were any others. 
Kathy eyes the girls down the hall. Raya turns, a last look. 
71   INT./EXT. UN SUV/GDA - NIGHT                                   71 
Kathy starts her car. She pulls out, turning left. Then, cranks the wheel right. 
72   EXT. ROAD - NIGHT                                              72 
Kathy's UN SUV swerves along the serpentine mountain road. 
A DOCTOR signs off on a final examination of a now much healthier looking Raya. He smiles. She signs a form. 
84   INT. LAURA'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - DAY                         84 
Laura hovers in the background as Raya dials the phone. Her face raw with emotion. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
85   INT. RAYA'S APARTMENT - KYIV - SAME                            85 
The phone in the hall rings. But no one is there to answer. 
86   INT. ROMAN AND ZENIA'S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON                   86 
Halyna at the door. Zenia pales. O.S. A kettle whistles. 
ZENIA (UKRAINIAN) Roman will be home soon. 
HALYNA (UKRAINIAN) Make your tea. I'll be quick. 
KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER 
Zenia pours tea out of a chrome kettle. Her hands shake. Halyna stares at a new dishwasher. Then a microwave, blender and small LCD TV. Suspiciously out of context in Kyiv. 
HALYNA (UKRAINIAN) (CONT'D) Roman seems to be doing well. 
ZENIA (UKRAINIAN) Milk? TWB 42. 
HALYNA I need to borrow money. 
Zenia looks up, unsure. 
HALYNA (CONT'D) They found Raya in Sarajevo. I want to go and get her. I don't need much. 
Zenia nods, keeping still as possible. 
HALYNA (CONT'D) Does he still hit you? 
Zenia chokes on her tea. Conflicted between love and guilt. She wants so badly to say... but she can't. 
HALYNA (CONT'D) You know I hate to ask. But she's my daughter... and your niece. Please-- 
ZENIA I'll get you the money... But you have to go. Roman will be home soon. He won't give it to me if he knows it's for you. 
87   INT. RICK JONES' OFFICE - MORNING                             87 
Kathy watches Rick flip through her report. 
KATHY Fred Murray. There were other officers too. But the raid was not in the books. These girls were just sent back. They are clearly not waitresses. They are victims. I think IPTF were paid off to turn a blind eye. 
RICK JONES That's a serious allegation. And you don't have any evidence. I can't open an investigation based on a hunch. 
He drops the papers. 
RICK JONES (CONT'D) You're gonna need more than this. 
88   INT. GDA BOSNIA - AFTERNOON                                   88 
Raya and Irka sit across from Laura Levin. She slides a document over to each of them. TWB 43. 
LAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN) If you sign here, you confirm that you are voluntarily entering the repatriation program at the GDA. 
Raya eyes Irka, confused. Laura softens slightly... 
LAURA LEVIN (CONT'D) This means we can get you out of Bosnia. Isn't that what you want? 
Raya's eyes widen. Irka is shocked, but joyous. They never thought this moment would come... 
LAURA LEVIN (CONT'D) You'll stay here for two weeks, to continue medical treatment as well as psychological counselling. We'll give you a ticket home and a stipend of $200 to get started when you return. 
Suddenly Irka's face drops. 
IRKA (RUSSIAN) But... What do I do then? My parents were killed in Kosovo. It was my brother who sold me here... Can't I go somewhere else? 
Laura fumbles. 
LAURA LEVIN We can only send you home, but what you choose to do after that is up to you. 
But now, angry tears well in Raya's eyes. She looks up, torn. 
RAYA (RUSSIAN) What about the others, the girls in the bar. My friend Luba, we ran, she couldn't... I don't know where she is... I can't go without her. Please... 
Laura pauses, taken aback. 
LAURA LEVIN I'm sorry, but my role here is to get you home. Otherwise you stay in Bosnia, where you... could face charges for illegal prostitution. 
Raya stares, reeling... To be made to feel like a criminal? TWB 44. 
IRKA I will sign. 
Raya looks at her, but Irka doesn't look back. 
89   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - SHORT TIME LATER                 89 
Kathy stares out across the central courtyard. Into the adjoining building. Through the glass, she watches... 
Nadia lifts up her sweatshirt, revealing a long scar. 
Kathy inspects the photo: Nadia with a SOUTH AMERICAN and U.S. IPTF: Their arms around her. One licks her face. 
NADIA (CONT'D) They burn me. Then they laugh. 
Kathy eyes Nadia... Silently in awe of her strength. 
KATHY Do you have any more pictures? 
93   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                             93 
Kathy pins Nadia's photo on a large bulletin board. Steps back. The wall is covered in photos of girls. 
Kathy reaches for the phone. Dials. 
ERIN (O.S.) ...Hello? 
KATHY Erin. What are you doing? TWB 48. 
ERIN (O.S.) It's three in the morning, ma... I'm sleeping. 
Kathy sits back, relieved. 
ERIN (O.S.) (CONT'D) Mom, are you okay? 
KATHY Yeah. I just was thinking about you. 
ERIN Okay, can I go back to bed now? 
KATHY Yeah. Of course, I just... It's great to hear your voice. 
94   INT. RICK JONES' OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                       94 
Kathy stands before Rick's desk. He smiles at her, convivial. 
RICK JONES How're things? 
KATHY Busy. I followed up on the Florida Bar. It's worse than I thought. There was a protection racket. IPTF... Americans, Romanians, were taking pay-offs to make sure the place wasn't busted. That raid was a punishment bust, because the owner stopped paying. But he must've settled it because the girls are right back where they started. Locked up in the hills. 
Rick scrambles for words, but Kathy's not finished. 
KATHY (CONT'D) I talked to thirty five girls at the Shelter. All this testimony can't be ignored. Our guys are patronizing the bars in large numbers. Rick, serious abuses are taking place. It's all in my reports. 
Kathy lays her stack of files on the desk. 
RICK JONES Okay, let's back up a second here-- TWB 49. 
KATHY I've got two girls ready to testify about IPTF taking pay-offs-- 
RICK JONES Testify where? 
KATHY In court. 
RICK JONES A Bosnian court? Not gonna happen. All International Personnel have immunity. 
Kathy is stopped. 
KATHY I know. But there must be some channel, some exception-- 
RICK JONES Look, you've done really good work here. These are serious allegations. Let me look into how to handle it. I'll get back to you. 
95   EXT. OLD TOWN - SARAJEVO - EVENING                             95 
The markets shut down. The Catholic Church Bells ring. Across the square the Call to Prayer echoes from old loudspeakers`. 
96   INT. KITCHEN - KATHY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                       96 
Jan stirs a pan. Kathy awkwardly cuts vegetables beside him. 
JAN It's different for us. We're all military or police. Every contingent except for the U.S... if someone does something wrong, they have to answer to a military tribunal at home. With the Americans... your Dyncorp guys? I don't think you have that. 
KATHY So the Americans aren't legally accountable for anything? 
JAN To be honest, I think our superiors would keep it quiet too. I mean, I haven't seen a military tribunal. TWB 50. 
Jan can't help noticing that Kathy is making a mess of the vegetables. He takes the knife. She walks away, preoccupied. 
JAN (CONT'D) You know my mission stay is up in a few weeks... You could come home with me. 
KATHY To do what? 
She turns, glass of wine in hand, leaning on the counter. 
JAN I was just... This place, y'know, it gets to you. I'm, I'm worried what will happen to you a year from now. 
She puts down her glass of wine, irritated. 
KATHY You don't need to worry about me. 
JAN Someone does. 
She looks at him, seeing... It's not discouragement. It's love. 
KATHY So Fred Murray could just walk up to a man and shoot him in daylight and he'd never see the inside of a courtroom? 
LAURA LEVIN I was going to call you. There was a problem. During our repatriation procedures, we realized Irka had no passport. 
KATHY So we get her one. Where is she? 
LAURA LEVIN You don't get it. She was trafficked from Belgrade. Her parents were killed in Kosovo. And she has no documentation. No embassy will recognize her. She is a girl without a country. 
KATHY She is a witness for a UN investigation! 
GDA EMPLOYEES peer. An INTERN betrays a twinge of complicity. 
LAURA LEVIN We handed her over to the police a few hours ago. I couldn't keep her. I've already done every favour I could for you. This is not on me. 
KATHY You had no right to do that! 
LAURA LEVIN I had every right. We have a system that works here. You're the one disrupting it. 
Kathy stares at her. Fuming. 
KATHY Where did they take her? 
Laura shrugs. Shaking off guilt has become a necessary habit. 
Just then the door opens. And... TWB 54. 
HALYNA 
Walks in. Disoriented, emotion rising... 
HALYNA (BROKEN ENGLISH) I... look for Laura Levin? 
LAURA LEVIN (RUSSIAN) That's me. 
Kathy holds her anger, smiling respectfully at Halyna. Laura leads her away. Kathy searches for an answer, her eyes landing on... The Intern. Unrelenting... 
KATHY If you know anything, this is on you. 
INTERN I think the cops leave them somewhere near the border, so that with no papers, the girls have to cross the border illegally. Take the 103 to Visegrad. 
105   INT./EXT. UN SUV - NIGHT                                      105 
Kathy. Speeding down the 103. A two-lane winding road. Seeing... Nothing but the 20 feet her headlights show. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
106   INT./ EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                         106 
Viko steers the Van around a corner. Raya sits in the back. 
107   INT. LAURA LEVIN'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - SAME                 107 
Laura hands an excited Halyna a cup of tea. 
LAURA (RUSSIAN) She'll be back in about an hour. 
108   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SAME                                       108 
Kathy's eyes GLUED on the road, trying to make out a SIGN... 
LANDMINES. Then another sign... VISEGRAD PRAVO. 
Sharp Turn. Onto a GRAVEL ROAD. She brakes. SKIDDING. 
109   INT. POLICE VAN / EXT. SARAJEVO - SAME                        109 
Viko stops at a traffic light. Raya peers out a crack in the van. Seeing... Young WOMEN in the streets. Laughing. TWB 55. 
110   INT./EXT. UN SUV - SAME                                       110 
Kathy slows her car... FLICKERING LIGHTS. She approaches... 
A BORDER STATION: A GRAVEL ROAD leads up to it. Kathy slows. 
BORDER GUARDS smoke and play cards. One guard saunters over. 
KATHY I'm looking for a girl. She was dropped here a few hours ago. 
He shrugs, shaking his head. 
KATHY (CONT'D) Can you check the border logs? She's about 15, the police brought her here but she didn't have a passport. Maybe-- 
GUARD Lady. I know what you're looking for. Those girls do not go through the border. They go through there... 
He points... A THICK Forest. Stretching for MILES. 
GUARD (CONT'D) To Serbia. 
Kathy stares at the endless forest. A dirt road cuts through the middle. She jumps in her SUV, and HURTLES down the road. 
111   INT./EXT. POLICE VAN/SARAJEVO - SAME                          111 
Viko turns down a narrow street. He glances in his rear view mirror. An old TRABBANT follows him. He veers down an alley. 
112   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                           112 
Kathy's SUV crawls alongside the FOREST. HIGHBEAMS off the top of the car. SCANNING all around. Then, in a clearing up ahead... 
They step inside, and IN ONE GLANCE, see... THE WHOLE SET OF GIRLS is different. No Luba, No Raya, No Tanjo... The IPTF barely notice her. 
127   EXT. FLORIDA BAR - NIGHT                                      127 
Kathy steps out. Furious. 
VIKO They moved them already. 
KATHY Fuck! 
At the end of her rope. 
128   INT. GDA - NIGHT                                              128 
Laura, at a total loss, eyes... Halyna. Sitting. Terrified. 
HALYNA (RUSSIAN) ...How could? No, no, no... my, Raya.... What!? What will they do to her? 
129   EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT                                    129 
A BROWN VAN snakes through the distant mountain roads. 
130   INT. BROWN VAN - SAME                                         130 
IVAN, 40s, drives. Tanjo is in the passenger seat. 
TANJO (SERBIAN) We'll stop soon. We're far enough now. 
Ivan nods. Tanjo cranes into the back of the van. He turns on an overhead light, revealing... 
Five girls. Huddled in the back. 
TANJO (RUSSIAN) (CONT'D) So you want to testify? 
All the girls turn to... Raya. Their conscience paralyzed by the need to survive. Terrified, Raya looks to... Luba. Her eyes pleading for support. But Luba turns away. TWB 59. 
TANJO (CONT'D) It's okay. We all move to a new bar now. Somewhere no one will come look for you. Then we have a conversation. 
The girls avoid Raya's gaze. She sobs. Tanjo turns off the light. The van drives off into the unknown. 
131   EXT. PARKING LOT - BACK ENTRANCE - UNMHQ - MORNING            131 
Kathy stands by her SUV, watching MONITORS set off for the day. Then she sees... 
Fred Murray emerge with COLLEAGUES, laughing. He stops when 
He sees Kathy, gazing over, serious. 
132   EXT. PARKING LOT - UNMHQ- DAY                                 132 
Kathy and Fred walk between the parked cars. 
KATHY She's fifteen. I'm begging you-- 
FRED MURRAY I don't know what you're talking about. 
KATHY If you know any of the other bars he owns, anything... I'm appealing to-- 
FRED MURRAY Hey. I'm gonna say this one more time. And you can put this down in your investigation on me. I don't know what you're talking about. 
He leaves. Kathy stands, a black speck in the patchwork of white UN SUVs spread across the lot. 
133   INT. RICK JONES OFFICE - UNMHQ - DAY                          133 
Rick's SECRETARY shakes her head at Kathy. 
SECRETARY I've called and paged. He says he can't get into this now. 
KATHY Does he know that one of my witnesses was abducted? Where is he? 
SECRETARY Sorry Kathy, he really didn't tell me. TWB 60. 
134   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - MORNING                        134 
MADELEINE It's not your fault. 
Kathy is downcast. She nods, not totally convinced. 
KATHY Irka won't testify now. It's completely understandable. She's way too scared. I just... I don't know what to do with her. The GDA won't take her and her traffickers will find her if she's in this city. 
Emotion taking over... 
KATHY (CONT'D) These girls are dragged into this country like cattle and then the system that's supposed to help them spits them right back out. It barely recognizes sex trafficking as a problem even though it's a fucking epidemic, and everyone knows it. Are we supposed to wait around for that to change? 
MADELEINE Maybe it's time for a little diplomacy... Do you have a nice frock? 
135   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - NIGHT                                135 
Kathy stands in front of a mirror, in a black dress, her hair hanging down to her shoulders. She stands, awkward. 
KATHY Really? You think it's okay? 
She turns to Jan and Carmen, sitting on her bed. Jan smiles. 
JAN You're beautiful. 
KATHY I also think the American embassy should be aware of some of the problems we're having with our officers. 
Madeleine interjects... 
MADELEINE Your help with Irka's case can really raise awareness in the Mission around the issue of trafficking. 
Madeleine gives her a reassuring glance. Kathy sees the difference between a cop and a diplomat. 
139   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - NIGHT                        139 
Kathy stands. Still in her dress, going through files. Proud of the night's accomplishments, but her eyes linger on the board of girls... On the picture of Raya's APB. TWB 64. 
140   EXT. BOSNIAN COUNTRYSIDE - EARLY MORNING                      140 
Sun over the hills. A DOG follows a YOUNG BOY, 5, through a field. The boy stops, seeing a BROWN VAN down the road. 
He runs, waving as the van approaches. It slows to meet him. In the van... Ivan rolls down the window. 
BOY (SERBIAN) Can I come with you? 
IVAN (SERBIAN) Not today. 
The boy looks down, disappointed. 
IVAN (CONT'D) Tell your mother I'll be home for dinner. Then you and I will go for a walk. I have a present for you. 
BOY What is it? 
Ivan shrugs jokingly. Then smiles as he drives away. 
141   EXT. BOMBED OUT BUILDING - BOSNIAN COUNTRY HOUSE - MORNING    141 
The brown van pulls up. Ivan comes around it, and opens the back door. He reaches in and pulls out... AN OLD BICYCLE. 
TANJO (SERBIAN) You couldn't buy him a new one? You have money now. 
IVAN (SERBIAN) I'll fix this one up this afternoon. I had one like it. 
Tanjo lights a cigarette, moving to the destroyed building. 
TANJO They're downstairs. I want to get them out today. 
142   INT. STAIRWELL - BOMBED OUT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          142 
Ivan follows Tanjo down rickety steps. CRIES AND WHIMPERS GROW LOUDER as they descend into a 
BASEMENT 
TWO MEN stand guard. Tanjo walks past them. Opens a door. Ushering Ivan INSIDE where... TWB 65. 
GIRLS are huddled together. Luba, and THREE OTHERS. They look up... PETRIFIED... Offscreen, the cries swell. 
We realize the sound IS NOT COMING FROM THIS ROOM. Tanjo waves his fingers, methodically... 
TANJO (RUSSIAN) C'mon, let's go. 
The girls stand, helping one another. Tentative but submissive, they move toward him. He holds open the door. 
TANJO (CONT'D) I want to show you what happens when YOU DECIDE TO TALK TO COPS!!!! 
They jump back. His scream echoes. They move 
THROUGH THE HALL 
To a door on the other side. Tanjo nods. A guard opens the door onto A HORRIFIC SITE... Luba closes her eyes. But Tanjo pushes the girls in, one by one they go through into a 
BARREN ROOM 
And see... Raya... NAKED. HELD DOWN BY FOUR MEN. SPREAD EAGLE ON HER FRONT. WAILING. HER FACE SHOWS UNIMAGINABLE PAIN. And we see that... 
Two of the men holding her down are EXTINGUISHING LIT CIGARETTES INTO THE BALLS OF HER FOOT. 
RAYA Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!! 
But we realize... this is not the greatest cause of her pain. 
Luba's face whitens. Eyeing one MAN at Raya's backside. A flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from Raya, and drops... A PIPE onto the ground. 
The men step away. Leaving Raya. Collapsed into a ball. Now the girls all understand... there is no hope at all. 
143   EXT. CONFERENCE ROOM - UNHCR - DAY                            143 
Madeleine stands before a small group of REPORTERS. 
MADELEINE The young woman, who shall remain anonymous, arrived in Bosnia as a victim of sex trafficking and has survived horrific abuse. (MORE) TWB 66. 
MADELEINE (CONT'D) Ordinarily she would be repatriated to her country of origin. But because she is an orphan, she finds herself without a home. I'm pleased to announce that we have found a foster family in the United States. I want to thank Janet Wells for her assistance in making this happen. I believe this can stand as a signal that the International community in Bosnia and beyond is finally ready to recognize the growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a human rights abuse as abhorrent as the war crimes that drew the International Community to intervene in Bosnia in the first place. Thank you. 
REPORTER Now that the UN is finally recognizing sex-trafficking, how are you going to monitor it? 
Reporters flock with questions. Kathy stands in the back, proud. On the other side, Rick Jones watches. 
144   EXT. FRONT STEPS - UNHCR - SHORT TIME LATER                   144 
Kathy and Madeleine emerge, buzzing with their success. 
Kathy sits at the table, covered in photos of girls, flipping through the Dyncorp manual, irritated. 
KATHY Consolidate my leave... A fucking vacation? 
She shakes her head, overwrought. Flipping through the manual, seeing... 
KATHY (CONT'D) Who are these people? (stopping on a page) And why does Dyncorp, a company that sends American peacekeepers, have it's corporate headquarters in England? 
She looks up at Jan. He shrugs, sympathetic, wanting to help. 
KATHY (CONT'D) Of course I want to see my kids, of course. But... not like this. Not by being sent home like some hysterical woman... My God, it wasn't that easy to up and leave them. If I go home like this... It's like coming here, this whole thing was a... mistake. TWB 70. 
She shakes her head, lost in thought... Maybe it was... Jan sits beside her, concerned. 
JAN Nobody who knows you could think that. 
KATHY Really? I'm losing witnesses, suspects... It's one step forward, two steps back... 
Jan tries to jump in. But-- 
KATHY (CONT'D) No, seriously. I'm just a cop from Nebraska. What do I know? 
Jan shakes his head. 
JAN It's not what. It's who. You know them. 
He points at the files and photos of girls splayed all over the table. Kathy eyes them, torn between self-doubt and something much more instinctive... 
151   INT. LAURA LEVIN'S OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - EVENING              151 
Laura sits across from Halyna, who is heartbroken. 
LAURA (RUSSIAN) Mrs. Kochan... It's been a few weeks now. I don't know if there's much point-- 
HALYNA (RUSSIAN) But we-- I must-- I have to do something. There has to be something I can do?! 
Laura takes a second. Suddenly struck with an idea. 
152   EXT. OASIS BAR - MORNING                                      152 
A large WOOD HOUSE with a neon CAMEL sits in the mountains above the city of TUZLA. A VAN pulls up. 
153   INT. OASIS BAR - MOMENTS LATER                                153 
Raya, Luba follow Ivan up stairs. Ivan unlocks a 
BACK BEDROOM 
He bangs on a wall. FIVE GIRLS wake in cots on the ground. He motions for them to go in. They do. TWB 71. 
MARA, 19, hands Raya and Luba a piece of paper with CRUDE DRAWINGS of SEXUAL POSITIONS. A price value by each. 
MARA (RUSSIAN) You work in two hours. 
Ivan and Mara leave, locking the door behind him. 
The other girls go about their business, barely noticing Raya and Luba. But JULIA and TANYA, 16, come over. 
JULIA (RUSSIAN) You sleep on whichever mattresses are available. The last two girls in have to share. 
TANYA (RUSSIAN) They bring us food in the morning. You have to eat it all, or you get fined. 
Raya grabs her head. Feeling faint. She looks for a place to sit. Julia and Tanya help her to the ground. 
JULIA Don't let him see you like this. 
Luba walks over to the other side of the room. Finds a spot and sits. Raya watches her, hurt. Julia pushes a mattress aside. Underneath is a... COUNTING SYSTEM scratched into the floor. Each girls' name scratched with numbers beside it. 
JULIA (CONT'D) I'm the closest. Then I can go home. 
Raya barely has the energy to hold herself up. 
TANYA What's your name? 
RAYA (UKRAINIAN) Rayisa...Raya Kochan. 
Tanya scratches Raya's name into the floor. Then one mark. 
LUBA (RUSSIAN) It's all bullshit-- 
JULIA No! He sent a girl back three months ago. I was here! (to Luba) What is your name? 
Raya eyes Luba who's conflicted between loyalty to her friend and her own sense of survival. Luba tears up, but turns away. TWB 72. 
RAYA (softly) Her name is Luba. Luba Pankiw. 
154   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - UNMHQ - MORNING                         154 
Kathy works, angry, urgent now. On her desk... 
CLOSER: REPORT: PHOTO ID LINE-UP. Kathy matches circled ID photos of IPTF alongside testimony and Polaroids of girls. 
She works fast. Circling the photos, slapping files closed. When a... 
MAIL BOY slides in a cart, and places a stack of REPORTS on Kathy's IN-BOX. She pulls the first one off the top... 
159   INT. LONG CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - MORNING                       159 
Kathy, reports in hand, turns a corner, and... bumps into an OFFICER. She drops some files. He moves around her, as she bends to pick them up. She walks the rest of the hall, focused, and stops at a brass plaque: INTERNAL AFFAIRS. 
160   INT. OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNHMQ - MORNING           160 
Kathy marches in, nervous... MONITORS turn and see her, knowing who she is, but trying not to show it. She approaches a MALE MONITOR at a desk in the front. 
MALE MONITOR What can I do for you? 
The Monitor keeps typing as she talks. Kathy hesitates, then 
KATHY It's, I need to speak in-camera with a senior IA official. I don't have a name, but-- 
Kathy recognizes Peter Ward working in a back OFFICE. He sees her, then closes the door. 
MALE MONITOR Just a moment please. 
161   INT. CLOSED OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNMHQ - DAY        161 
Kathy sits across from an IA OFFICIAL, 50s. He skims through the reports, nodding. TWB 76. 
KATHY I did a photo ID line-up with victims who testified to international patronizing of brothels, as well as complicity in trafficking itself. 
He looks at her. 
KATHY (CONT'D) All the cases I filed to my superiors have come back, shut down. Some of them were marked as referred to IA. 
OFFICIAL I haven't seen those. 
KATHY Really? 
He shakes his head, standing. 
OFFICIAL It's possible they're still in the pipeline, in preliminary processing. I'm sorry to have to rush this, but I have to get to a meeting. Thanks for coming in. 
He hands her a form. 
OFFICIAL (CONT'D) You need to sign here, that you're asking for these investigations. 
162   EXT. HILLS - NIGHT                                          162 
Kathy jogs along a ridge, with a view high over Sarajevo. Determined, panting... she pushes past her fatigue. 
163   INT. KATHY'S APARMENT - SHORT TIME LATER                    163 
Kathy comes in, soaked in sweat. The PHONE RINGS. She rushes to it. CALLER ID: Unknown Number. She picks up, breathless. 
KATHY Hello?... Sorry, who is this?... Just one second... 
She grabs a pen and pad. Writing: THE HOLIDAY INN. 513. 
KATHY (CONT'D) Can I get your name? Hello? Hello? 
She looks at the phone, spooked. TWB 77. 
164   INT. LOBBY - HOLIDAY INN HOTEL - SARAJEVO - DAY               164 
Kathy moves through the lobby, scanning the scene of liquid lunches and diplomats. She keeps her head low, focused 
ON THE ELEVATORS 
Ding. The doors open. Kathy steps in. As they close... TWO DIPLOMATS slip in. The elevator ascends. Kathy stares dead ahead. 
165   INT. HALLWAY - HOLIDAY INN - MOMENTS LATER                    165 
Kathy stands at door 513. She takes a moment, then knocks. 
166   INT. HOTEL ROOM - HOLIDAY INN - MOMENTS LATER                 166 
Kathy is led in by Peter Ward. She comes inside, tentative, unsure who she's dealing with. Peter smokes furiously, a burned-out mission lifer, who's bright, intelligent eyes betray a last spark of the idealism that brought him into this world. He seems nervous. 
KATHY That was you today, in IA? 
PETER WARD (nodding) Would you like a drink? 
Kathy eyes him, dubious. He pours her a drink. 
PETER WARD (CONT'D) I saw your files... 
Kathy nods. Peter slaps down a file. Kathy looks at it. 
KATHY What's this? 
PETER WARD Your file. 
KATHY I don't understand. 
PETER WARD They're investigating you. 
Kathy stares at him. 
PETER WARD (CONT'D) Don't you get it? They're circling the wagons... What did he tell you? He hadn't seen anything from you until today. TWB 78. 
She nods.

Distant music echoes through the night. VOICES of GUYS hanging out on their balconies. Kathy crosses the lot, cutting through the dark night fog.

178   EXT. ILIDZA STATION - NIGHT                                   178 
Kathy sits in the SUV. Staring at the station. THROUGH THE WINDOW... Jan works the late shift alone. 
179   INT. ILIDZA STATION - NIGHT                                   179 
Jan and Kathy sit. Several empty coffee cups. 
KATHY This is... I can't believe your timing... 
JAN It's a rotation. They're sending us back a month early. I tried to get an extension, but... 
Kathy just stares ahead. Silent... a long time. 
KATHY I'm not even sure I'm staying. 
Jan sits back. Stunned. 
KATHY (CONT'D) These guys... Jones is a sexual offender. Dyncorp hired him... These private militaries are a sham. There's no way around them. 
JAN If that's what your instincts are telling you... 
KATHY I have children, I have to think about them... TWB 82. 
180   INT. OASIS BAR - LATE NIGHT                                  180 
A big IPTF PARTY. AT THE BAR: Raya waits with an empty tray. Luba pulls out a heavy crate of bottles. She hurts her back. 
RAYA (UKRAINIAN) Here, I'll help you. 
Luba slams two bottles on Raya's tray. 
LUBA (UKRAINIAN) I'm fine. I earned this job. 
RAYA I was just trying to-- 
LUBA Don't. You'll get us in trouble. 
An IPTF OFFICER, MIKE SEARS grabs Raya from behind. Shakes her, jokingly. She laughs, familiar. Almost routine.. 
MIKE SEARS How's my favorite girl? 
RAYA I am good. Everything good. 
She smiles, hollow and takes the tray over to a TABLE. Julia and Tanya sit with FOUR MEN in suits. They're plastered. 
SUIT 1 (GERMAN ACCENT) I wanna party all night. 
The girls smile, nodding, playing along... 
SUIT 2 (AMERICAN) Let's go out. I wanna take you home. 
He squeezes Tanya tight to him, kissing her sloppily. 
SUIT 2 (CONT'D) Ivan! C'mere! 
Raya eyes Julia. Ivan comes over, smiling, a gregarious host. 
SUIT 2 (CONT'D) We wanna party on mate. How much to take them home for the day? 
Ivan eyes the girls. Thinking... TWB 83. 
IVAN Ten times normal. Pay upfront. And extra deposit. But you cannot take her. 
He points at Raya. 
IVAN (CONT'D) Three thousand each. (off their scoffing) You bring back, you get back deposit. 
Ivan smiles. The other two men are dubious. But Suit 1 and Suit 2 exchange glances... Daring each other. 
SUIT 1 You're on. 
Ivan waves to follow him. They walk with Julia and Tanya. Raya watches Ivan throw in a bottle of whiskey. They pay him. 
Julia catches Raya's eye. They exchange... A look of promise. 
181   EXT. BUS DEPOT - MORNING                                     181 
Kathy brings Julia and Tanya in. An Intern leads them down the hall. Viko comes in... 
VIKO Should I call for a raid? TWB 86. 
KATHY No. He'll walk. We have no proof they were trafficked. Let me talk to them. See what else they know. 
190   INT. OFFICE - GDA BOSNIA - SHORT TIME LATER                  190 
Laura watches video footage on a TV. Halyna appears on the monitor. Her assistant PAUSES it. 
ASSISTANT That's their first cut. I'll pass on your notes, and they should have it ready for the grant proposal in time. 
A KNOCK at the door. 
191   INT. LOBBY - GDA BOSNIA - MOMENTS LATER                      191 
Kathy stands, curt now with Laura. All business. 
KATHY I have no options right now. The GDA is more secure than Milena's shelter... Can they stay before you do the paperwork? 
LAURA LEVIN They'll go on record? 
Kathy nods. Laura shrugs in assent. 
192   INT. KITCHEN - GDA BOSNIA - LATER                            192 
Kathy listens to a tearful Julia. 
JULIA (BROKEN ENGLISH) Ivan is good friends with the soldiers. They come all the time. 
KATHY And you're saying these soldiers brought you into Bosnia. Through the border? You're sure? 
JULIA Yes. In a van. White van. Like yours. 
They both nod. Emphatic. Kathy thinks... 
KATHY They had uniforms? Like mine? 
The girls nod again. Absolutely sure. TWB 87. 
JULIA April 8. I never forget. The day I leave my home. We come to Bosnia some day later. I know because we stop at the border. We were six of us. Men from the border, they opened the doors... We give them our fake passports. My name was Irena Woycek. I thought they would see the fake passports, I thought... 
She hesitates, the memories flooding back... 
JULIA (CONT'D) I thought they would save us. 
193   EXT. GDA BOSNIA - DAY                                        193 
Viko follows Kathy out. 
VIKO If there are records showing those girls came through the border with IPTF-- 
KATHY Then you have conspiracy to traffick. And I can take it to Bill Hynes. That's enough to do a raid that will stick. 
VIKO The main border station keeps the logs. 
Kathy heads to her SUV. Viko shakes his head -- points at an old TRABBANT (a life-size matchbox car). 
194   INT./ EXT. TRABANT - NIGHT                                   194 
The ride is bumpy. Viko shouts over the engine... 
VIKO Best if it looks like a local matter. Get more info. You be my UN monitor, okay? 
Kathy smiles, cramped, but appreciative of his help. 
195   EXT. BORDER POLICE STATION - NIGHT                           195 
Viko talks to a BORDER COP sitting at an ancient Mac Computer. Kathy notices a calendar of Pamela Anderson frolicking in foamy surf. 
VIKO So when a vehicle is stopped, you'll keep all this on file here? TWB 88. 
BORDER COP Of course! It's our fucking job! 
VIKO And other stations up the border send all their files to you? 
BORDER COP Some do, some don't. Fifty-fifty chance. 
Disappointing. Viko lights a smoke, offers one to the cop. 
BORDER COP (CONT'D) You say 30 minutes outside Sarajevo? Maybe Visegrad? You might be lucky. Lanky guy in their archives loves to send files. 
Kathy looks hopefully at Viko, who shrugs. Clicking... 
BORDER COP (CONT'D) Okay, 11th... (mumbling) ... No, no. You like?.. Big exciting to watch Bosnian police do boring things? 
Kathy smiles. He turns back, clicking. Then stops. 
BORDER COP (CONT'D) You owe me! UN vehicle with 6 girls in back. Stanley Harris. 
He turns proudly to them. 
BORDER COP (CONT'D) What you think? All his little sisters come to visit from America? 
Viko looks knowingly at Kathy. 
BARMAN Fuck you! 
Kathy eyes the girls. Their confusion, their fear... 
Danik, hesitates, confronted with the vulnerability of these girls... His face softens. He looks to Kathy for direction. 
KATHY You do not have to be afraid of Ivan Bladzic. He cannot hurt you now. TWB 92. 
But the GIRLS don't move... 
Kathy looks out -- Stunned -- Because she sees... 
Raya. Standing. Shocked. No idea who to trust anymore. One last shred left of the dream of escape... 
Kathy goes to her. But Raya's eyes dart to... Luba. 
Then to Kathy, recognizing the last kind face she saw... 
BARMAN (BROKEN ENGLISH) These girls work here. They have all documents, passports! You can fuck off. 
Two local cops GRAB him. Danik CUFFS him. 
The girls are astounded. Viko holds up passports. 
VIKO Fakes. Bad ones. 
The barman is dragged outside. Kathy scans the girls. Ending on Raya... her faith awakening. 
KATHY We want to get you out of here safely. That is my absolute priority. 
The girls exchange a flurry of looks, speaking volumes... Should we trust her? Can we risk it? 
KATHY (CONT'D) (To Viko) Get those blankets out of the vans. Let's get these girls out. 
But the girls still don't move... Raya. Fractured with despair... After all she has been through, all the punishment, all the pain... 
Raya holds Luba's gaze - Maybe even she could be convinced... 
And Raya starts to step to Kathy... When... 
Behind Kathy, an IPTF officer removes his helmet. Mike Sears. He stares at Raya. Petrifying her. 
Kathy sees it in her -- WHIPS around. Mike Sears avoids her gaze. Kathy turns back to Raya. Moving closer, quietly, out of earshot of the others... TWB 93. 
KATHY (CONT'D) You just have to tell me you want to go. That you do not work here voluntarily. And we will get you to safety. 
Raya wants so badly to answer. 
KATHY (CONT'D) You can leave with me this second. All of you can. But I need you to say it. 
Raya eyes Mike Sears - He looks to Luba. Luba turns back to Raya - Pleading -- Don't do it. 
KATHY (CONT'D) You know me. 
Raya can't look at Kathy. Tears stream down her face. 
KATHY (CONT'D) You can all leave with me! (to Raya) Let's go. 
Raya. With her heart breaking... 
RAYA No. 
Kathy looks at the all girls. Their eyes flitting between Mike and Kathy... And she understands... 
Kathy REELS around. Grabs Mike by the collar -- SHOVING him to the door -- SLAMMING him against the wall. 
KATHY Who the fuck are you? What have you done? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? You fuck! 
Mike pushes back... 
MIKE Get off me, you crazy bitch! 
KATHY They're supposed to TRUST US! 
Viko and Danik pull them apart. 
VIKO C'mon Kathy. It's over. TWB 94. 
She steps back -- Catching her breath -- Shaking her head -- NOT AGAIN... She looks at Raya, tears streaming down her terrified face... 
KATHY I know this girl. I know her. We can't leave them here. We're supposed to-- 
VIKO If they won't come, we can't force them. Nothing will hold up in court. They'll be returned and punished... Do you want blood on your hands? 
The girls all return to their positions behind the bar, cleaning, sitting around the edges... Not one will catch... 
Kathy's eye. She glares at Mike Sears. 
Kathy watches across the room, devastated... 
As Raya turns, giving up her last chance to leave, and exits to a back room. 
206   EXT. OASIS BAR - NIGHT                                        206 
Kathy paces frantically in the darkness. Eyes wild. 
Reaching it, Kathy looks through the EYEHOLE... And exhales. She opens the door to... Madeleine Rees. 
231   FRANZ'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                                 231 
Kathy listens, anxious as Madeleine lays it out... TWB 103. 
MADELEINE It's bollocks. Absolute and total. You have signed a contract with Dyncorp Aerospace Operations U.K... And there is no provision under English law for summary dismissal without due process or an investigation. 
Madeleine stops... seeing Kathy is overwhelmed. 
MADELEINE (CONT'D) But there was something else Bill said... If this is coming from above... Kathy,you need to prove that they are dismissing you because you were uncovering wide- spread corruption within this mission. If you can prove that this is indeed coming from Washington, that the State Department is instructing Dyncorp to fire you. Then we're talking about a conspiracy. 
KATHY They tell me... people disappear. They bug my house. I mean, I'm sitting here, worried there's a bomb in my car-- 
MADELEINE We can fight this. 
KATHY This isn't just my career, it's my life. I don't know if I'm ready to be a scapegoat. 
MADELEINE That's exactly what you are. 
KATHY Whose? 
She eyes Madeleine, pointed. Madeleine sits back. 
MADELEINE I don't know what to say to that. Think about this. Let me know what you want to do. I'll support you either way. 
232   EXT. MOUNTAINS - BOSNIA - EARLY MORNING                     232 
An aerial glide over the mountains of Bosnia. TWB 104. 
233   INT. OASIS BAR - BACK BEDROOM - MORNING                       233 
The girls sleep in their cots, when... BAM! Ivan kicks open the door. He throws Raya in. On the ground. The girls wake. 
Ivan. He picks Raya up by the neck. She fights. Luba runs in. 
RAYA (RUSSIAN) I didn't say anything. I never will. Why are you doing this? I just want to go home. I want to see... Mama... Mama... 
But he kicks Raya in the stomach. She ROARS in pain. He flips her over. Shaking her. He looks to the other girls. FURIOUS. 
IVAN (RUSSIAN) This all happened because of you. 
He pulls out a gun. Raya looks to Luba for help. But it's too late. Ivan presses the gun to Raya's head. 
He glares into Raya's eyes. A flash of ire. 
Raya reaches again... Luba steps forward, when... BANG!!!! 
217   Raya's body falls. Luba turns away. She cups her hand over    217 her mouth. But a loud cry wails through... 
234   EXT. MOUNTAINS - BOSNIA - DAY                                 234 
The sound of Luba's scream fades over the morning. The wide horizon is calm. But a closer look reveals... 
235   EXT. RIVER - MOUNTAINS - BOSNIA - DAY                         235 
POLICE cordon off a RIVER BANK. Through an opening we see... 
Viko. Keeping local cops at bay. Behind him is... Kathy. In civilian clothes. Standing over a... 
DEAD BODY. Raya. Kathy stares, expressionless. Viko clears the cops out. Kathy turns, and retches. She pulls air into lungs, then straightens. She looks up to the trees, the apex of this leafy cathedral, as if invoking some higher power. 
236   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - DAY                             236 
Kathy comes in. Madeleine looks up from a phone call. 
KATHY What do I do? TWB 105. 
MADELEINE Hand in an appeal. Keep reporting to work. Watch how they respond. Build your case... And catch them in their lies. 
237   INT. UNMHQ - DAY                                              237 
Kathy holds an envelope. Hynes' SECRETARY looks at Kathy. MUFFLED SCREAMING from his office. Kathy leaves the letter. 
SECRETARY Ms. Bolkovac... I, me and the other secretaries... Your email was the bravest thing anyone's even done in this mission. 
Kathy nods, truly appreciating that. She walks away, her silhouette growing smaller and smaller down the hall. 
The secretary takes Kathy's letter. Walking into 
BILL HYNES' OFFICE 
Bill paces around Rick Jones, Ambassador Wells and John Morgan. Hynes grabs Kathy's letter. 
MORGAN Get something on her! Get anything! 
238   INT. PERSONNEL - UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY                238 
Carmen listens to an anxious Kathy. 
KATHY If you could just go into my office, I'll give you a key to the cabinets... 
But Carmen can't even meet Kathy's eye. 
CARMEN Kath... my parents really need the money I send home. It's a lifesaver for them. My Dad has medical bills... I'm so sorry. 
She turns. Peter stands over her. Eyeing the tape recorder. 
PETER WARD (CONT'D) Scrambling devices. 
She looks at him, waiting for his next move. His eyes soften. 
PETER WARD (CONT'D) It probably won't work in most of the rooms. Now c'mon. Get out of here. 
She smiles, silently thanking him. She shoves the recorder in her pocket. Grabs the bag. Thrown by it's heaviness. Peter helps her get it on her shoulder. 
He ushers her out. Locking the door behind them. They move 
DOWN THE HALL 
When Rick Jones barrels after them. Waving Kathy's appeal. IPTF OFFICERS come out of their office. Kathy rushes into 
THE ELEVATOR 
Quickly looking around THE METAL PANELING. She drops the bag. An ECHO REVERBERATES through the HOLLOW SHAFT. Kathy turns... TWB 109. 
Again slipping her hand in her pocket. This time determined. 
RICK JONES I'm gonna tell you this in front of him and everybody else, you no longer have a UN ID. You no longer have a UN job. You do not have a job with the Department of State. The Department of State holds your contract. They are the ones who are pulling it. You will not have an appeal. You will not have a hearing. You will not have anything. Do you understand? 
Kathy lets the doors close without saying a word... 
245   INT. KATHY'S OFFICE - MISSION HEADQUARTERS - SAME           245 
The lights are off. The office sits untouched. Move over the bulletin board, still overflowing with faces of girls. 
246   INT. HALLWAYS - UNITED NATIONS HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT         246 
The halls. Quiet. Still. No sense of the noise to come... 
REPORTER'S VOICE (O.S.) ...suspected UN involvement in international sex trafficking. Rumors of these allegations began surfacing after an email was sent describing... 
247   INT. STUDIO - BBC HARDTALK - DAY                            247 
BBC CHIMES. Bill Hynes talks to TIM SEBASTIAN. 
BILL HYNES I can categorically state that not one United Nations Officer has been involved in the trafficking of a single woman. 
TIM Are you saying that you believe all these victims' claims to be false? 
BILL HYNES (O.S.) I don't want to make accusations about those girls. But I will assert over and over again, I run a ZERO TOLERANCE program for that type of activity... 
248   INT. FRANZ' HOUSE - DAY                                     248 
Kathy watches footage of Bill Hynes on BBC. She stares in disbelief. Then picks up... THE GYM BAG FULL OF FILES. TWB 110.

250   INT. EDITING ROOM - UN MISSION HEADQUARTERS - DAY             250 
ON A TV: Girls in silk robes. No sign of torture. They smile at their saviours. Knights in bullet-proof vests.

RICK JONES Any unused footage. Use it all. I want the press flooded with EPKs. 
251   INT. MADELEINE REES' OFFICE - DAY                             251 
Madeleine speaks to REPORTERS. 
REPORTER What do you say to rumors that Dyncorp are working to have you removed? 
MADELEINE Try me... These raids are for show and completely amateurish. This is the biggest cover-up I have ever seen! 
252   EXT. BASARABSKA MARKET - DAY                                  252 
Kathy moves through TOURISTS browsing for jewelry. Holding the gym bag tight. She turns a corner down a 
SIDE STREET 
240   Narrow. TWO PEOPLE WIDE.. Keeping her eyes to the ground.     240 
BILL HYNES (O.S.) We've had a UN inspection by senior investigators from New York. We've had inspectors from the State Department.

258   Small and dark. Kathy spots... A WOMAN in the back.           258 TWB 111. 
255   EXT. BACK PATIO - PIZZA SHOP - BASARABSKA MARKET - DAY        255 
Kathy sits across from JOANNA PAUL SMITH. Eyeing her gym bag. 
JOANNA PAUL SMITH (BRITISH ACCENT) I've been working at Human Rights Watch for fifteen years. We've been keeping close tabs on this. No one has come forward with anything solid before.

1 ALLEY LOADING PLATFORM AND CORRIDOR OF FAIRMONT HOTEL 
NIGHT The story begins in this grubby alley, where two extra large ambulances screech to a stop beside a loading platform. Onlookers gather in the alley entrance to see how many people died; nobody died, the backdoors of the ambulances are opened by attendants, and six perfectly fine victims of perfectly terrible automobile accidents are lifted into wheelchairs. The cripples are beautifully dressed, the men in tuxedos, the women in splendid evening dresses. One of the women wears a neck brace which forces her always to look skyward, so she cantt see the beautiful orchid corsage pinned to her bosom. Quickly, attendants roll the wheelchairs past all the stacks of fruit and vegetables on the loading platform, past great bales of laundry, past whatever horrors one finds behind the warm, smiling face of a hotel. Watch- men, pastry cooks, valets are watching the rush of the wheelchairs without much interest. Then doors swing open, and we are in the tram It of the grand ballroom. 
2 INTO GRAND BALLROOM It is a charity ball. The sign says "Shake for Highway Safety."' The wheelchairs and their occupants no longer interest us. They are the guests of honor, and people gather about them to arrange them appealingly, and we rush past the go-go band, the shakers, and the door prize, which is a little convertible, spinning endlessly on a pedestal. CAMERA reaches PETULIA, who is dancing with her husband, DAVID, but trying not to lose sight of ARCHIE. ARCHIE really wants to leave, but he is too polite to make it too obvious. As he bends over to put his punch cup on a table, he is bumped by the wheelchair of one of the guests of honor. He is not at all comfortable. 
2 CONTINUED 
E It's not easy for Petulia to keep an eye on Archie; gasping faces get in the ways hunks of twisting bodies get in the way, and the dance won't end. The music stops for a second, everyone sags and thinks, "Thank God it's over," but instantly the music begins again and everyone good naturedly swears, "Those crazy kids are trying to kill us," and meanwhile Petulia sees that Archie has reached the place where you get your coat. 
MED. ARCHIE He is searching through his pockets for the ticket that will let him reclaim his coat. All the coats are in an incredible piles and in the semi-hysterical care of a debutante attendant. 
PETULIA' S VOICE You can't leave He turns and sees Petulia. 
PETULIA You're an official host. She nods to the ribbon and cardboard which along with 'Official Host' says Dr. A. Bollen. Archie takes the ribbon off, as though to pin it on Petulia. 
PETULIA Careful. Can you tell I'm not wearing a brassiere? 
ARCHIE No. 
PETULIA Don't think about it. It will only excite you. Archie finally finds the ticket for his coat, which the attendant now tries to find. On through this Petulia continues.

PETULIA That's my husband over there, 
ARCHIE Ahh ... 
PETULIA I've been married six months and I've never had an affair, 
ARCHIE It can happen 
PETULIA Don't take it so bloody well. I've just turned you down. He's looking at us. My husband, 
MED. DAVID WITH HIS MOTHER AND FATHER somewhere near the free whiskey table asking for Pernod, which, of course, they don't have. The father is watching the charity affair with utter disapproval. He tips a waiter by shoving a half-dozen raffle tickets into the waiter's jacket pocket, 
MR, DANNER I hope you win the car, sir, Mrs. Danner is charmed by her husband's generosity. She simply adores the man. David is busy not watching Archie and Petulia, 
PETULIA'S VOICE Isn't he gorgeous? He's a naval architect. It really zings when you say it. "My husband David is a naval architect." Actually, we're starving. You wouldn't want to buy a sixty foot sloop? David's "Momma"` and "Poppa' keep us. Look how disgusted Poppa is. He hates this sort of thing. 
L 
2 CONTINUED 
ARCHIEIS VOICE Poppa is too sensitive. 
PETULIA'S VOICE Sensitive, my ass. He's bored. Highway safety's so blah. Also, he hates amateurs. Give him something he can sink his teeth into - "Rheumatoid Arthritis" Â® "Muscular Dystrophy"' -m and he's the best there is. A real pro. A little lame girl with a ribbon in her hair and a crutch under her arm, and Poppa can set the world on fire. He's really slumming tonight. 
BARNEY'S VOICE Hello, Archie. 
MED. PETULIA AND ARCHIE have been joined by BARNEY and WILMA, Archie's best friends. Barney and Wilma are taking off their coats. Barney is already beginning to move to the music. 0 Wilma is doing absolutely nothing but looking at Petulia. 
WILMA Everybody came late. 
ARCHIE Left arm or right? How do you brush it? 
PETULIA Left. 
ARCHIE An hour a day. 
0 PETULIA At least. 
2 CONTINUED 
ARCHIE You' 11 have a problem. The bursa sheath. Very sensitive, Bursitis. It'll hurt. 
PETULIA I'll come to you. 
ARCHIE I wouldn't be able to help much. Just aspirin. 
PETULIA And sympathy? 
ARCHIE Sure. 
_. PETULIA Thank you, Archie. Damn it, how can I have an affair with an unmarried man. There has to be some equality of guilt. 
ARCHIE My divorce doesn't become final till next 
month. 
PETULIA I'll get my purse. But in turning to do so she sees David, then the spinning car, the door prize. 
PETULIA 
ARCHIE What? 
PETULIA I've been told that I'll be the one to draw the winning ticket. I'm always picked for things like that. I radiate incorruptibility. Money can't buy me. She shakes her head, thoughtfully. During all this the door- man has been busily opening and closing the door for them as they keep changing their mind. 
PETULIA It feels so super. Suddenly, all that love. 
3 EXT. BUS TERMINAL 
All we see is the wheel of a car resting on the back of a small boy, pinning him to the ground and people shocked, not knowing what to do. 
ARCHIE'S VOICE Well, stay then. 
L PETULIA'S IMAGE ENDS AND WE ARE BACK IN THE GRAND BALLROOM 
PETULIA Archie, why do you play this dumb game? This crappy pretense at resisting the beautiful lady? You're bloody lucky I'm even talking to you. How many kids do you have besides fat Mike? 
ARCHIE Six. 
PETULIA G'night. 
ARCHIE Actually, only one besides Mike. 
PETULIA Meet you outside. 
5 EXT. DREAM MOTEL NIGHT 
A motel sign: "Dream Motel."' A concrete oval, spiral- ling up four floors. You drive to your room and everything is geared to get you to bed electronically. But you must have a car, and Petulia and Archie have come by cab. Archie is paying the cabbie. 
PETULIA (to cabbie) You mustn't take it personal. (she indicates the "No Cabs" sign) Lucky we don't have luggage. 
ARCHIE Does this trouble you? 
PETULIA A little. 
(CONTINUING) ... a police car careening down the highway, sirens going full blast. And I plunge madly into your arms But she is now totally winded and cannot say another word. Archie reacts to a sudden phenomena: a tiny light on the key in his hand starts flicking on and off furiously. Just ahead of him is the door of their motel room. Archie is aghast at the pulsating key. 
ARCHIE 
(PLAINTIVELY) My apartment's only four blocks from 
HERE 
7 INT. DREAM MOTEL ROOM 
Stark is hardly the word but it will have to do. A control panel takes care of the drapes, T.V., stereo, announcements from the office, etc., etc., etc. There are mirrors everywhere and the first thing Petulia does is establish contact between the vanity mirror, the mirror on the bathroom door and the medicine cabinet mirror so that she is reflected endlessly. 
PETULIA You have 624 women in this room and I'm still counting. Archie moves behind her and begins unbuttoning the top buttons on the back of her dress. 
PETULIA 
(HARSHLY) Just wait a minute, okay? Archie plops on the bed in his coat, a most iropic smile on his face -- he is beginning to suspect he is not going to get laid. Petulia is examining all the Petulia faces in the mirrors. 
PETULIA My great-grandmother is ninety-one and still has a granite chin. Archie pushes a gadget beside the bed and it begins to vibrate. Petulia sees endless Archies vibrating on endless beds. 
7 CONTINUED 
PETULIA What a lecherous lot 
ARCHIE She's ninety-ones eh? 
PETULIA But no fun. 
ARCHIE Not at ninety-one, hell 
PETULIA She stopped having fun at twenty-eight when her husband was killed in the first war, in a trench looking just like Cary Grant with a waxed moustache. She can't remember him but she does remember Cary Grant because he is from Bristol, too, and often in the news. If his picture is in the paper he gets a waxed moustache whether he likes it or not. She turns to face Archie. She is afraid and she is angry and she doesn-t know quite what to do from one moment to the next. But she knows he shouldn't be in an overcoat jiggling on a jiggling bed, 
PETULIA Stop being so damn casual. Archie sits up but is still casual, 
PETULIA We're about ï¿½td become lovers, Did you bring an instrument, Archie? 
ARCHIE Eh? 
PETULIA Ring for room service. Ask the robot for something splendid and musical,, 
ARCHIE Saxophone? Electric Organ? Tuba? 
PETULIA A tuba. Absolutely; Bless you, Ar--hie; A tuba; Something large and twirly and pom to pom .pomX Archie, this is an event. We 0 are about to become lovers. 
7 CONTINUED 
ARCHIE You said that. 
PETULIA It can't be said often enough. 
ARCHIE Are we? 
PETULIA Are we what? 
ARCHIE About to become lovers? 
PETULIA No. 
ARCHIE Ah, you swinging young marrieds. He leaves. 
8 EXT. ROOM 
Across from the ramp there is the elevator the man on T.V. mentioned. Archie is already there waiting for it to arrive. Petulia starts toward him angrily. 
ARCHIE (at the same time) No, I've been up for hours, waiting for the doorbell to ring, 
PETULIA , 0 think how surprised the-man who owns the pawnshop is going to be when he sees all that broken glass. 
14C EXT. PAWN SHOP 
A brick smashes the glass, scattering cameras, mandolins, etc. in the midst of which is the white tuba. 
PETULIA'S VOICE Archie, how come the burglar alarm didn't go off? 
14D INT. ARCHIE'S APT. 
0 The scene continues. 
PETULIA Wherets it all going to end if the burglar alarms won't go off? Take me to bed, Archie, 
ARCHIE Get the hell out of here . please. He reaches to help Petulia to her feet but as he touches her waist to lift her, she screams and faints, 
15 INT. HALLWAY OF DANNER HOUSE NIGHT 
But we don't know it's the Danner house. All we see is Petulia crumpling as she is struck. She hits the floor and just lies there, not making a sound. (Also SHOOT in slow motion.) 
16 INT. ARCHIE' S APARTMENT 
Archie breaks an ammonia ampule under Petulia's nose. Her head wrenches away and she opens her eyes. Archie has begun to prod her side; she is in pain. 
16 CONTINUED 
PETULIA I've got a broken rib, I think, I can feel it broken, Archie. 
ARCHIE Don't you know you can puncture a lunge 
PETULIA Hopping around with tubas and stuff -- isntt it kooky, though? Archie has begun to remove her dress. 
PETULIA When are we going to stop trying to undress me? 
ARCHIE Shut up. 
PETULIA Leave me alone, Archie. Archie sees she really means it, 
ARCHIE 
It's just a rib to me, 
PETULIA That's why. Call a proper doctor, 
ARCHIE What do you think I am? 
PETULIA A hairy legged old lecher running around in pajama bottoms, 
ARCHIE Get your clothes off, 
PETULIA As a woman, not as a rib. Archie is harassed. The phone begins ringing. He grabs it angrily. 
ARCHIE (into phone) I'm awake! I'm awake; How many times are you gonna call?I He hangs up, then realizes this was the first wake up call. 
16 CONTINUED 
E ARCHIE (to Petulia) You know what a- you'll drive me cuckoo. He sighs. and begins dialing a number. Petulia is in real pain. Like a,little child she crawls under the covers of his bed, pulling the quilt up around her as though Archie's left over warmth will make the pain go away. 
ARCHIE (into phone) Barney? Archie. Fine fine , , fine , I want you to look at a patient for me. Now. At my place. My apartment, Barney, it's very complicated and I haven't had my morning coffee yet. Her name is Petulia. I don't know her last name, Barney. Yes, Petulia. Barney, shut up. I have to get to the hospital. 
16A BARNEY'S BEDROOM MORNING During the above we catch a glimpse of sleepy Barney sleepily asking stupid questions. 
POLO This is very strange. I didntt think I'd feel like this. Mostly sad. Archie's sad, too, therefore he is more brusque than necessary. Also he is bugged by the cookies. 
ARCHIE You need anything, Polo? 
POLO No. Well, yes. Well, yes and no. 
ARCHIE 
(SMILING) I think that covers all the possibilities. Polo laughs, suddenly they share a moment of warmth. 
POLO It's such a puzzle. We really got on so marvelously. Never fought. Never screamed at each other. Not once. â¢ Something in his silence, plus that damned unmade bed, is beginning to make her angry. 
POLO Everybody we knew envied us. 
ARCHIE We were a handsome couple. This makes her so angry she can now say what she came to say. 
POLO I think I've fallen in love. The man is Warren Smith. He's an engineer and very good with the children, but he wants to go back to school and get his masters in hydraulics. (very long pause) Well, say something. 
ARCHIE 
(BLANDLY) I think that's fine, Polo. 
â¢ POLO 
(MILDLY) Go to hell. 
0 30 CONTINUED Tie phone begins ringing. Archie crosses to it. 
ARCHIE Hello? (no answer) Hello? 
POLO Were going to'be married. 
ARCHIE Great. (into phone) Hello? 
31 INT. DANNER HOUSE NIGHT 
' David is on the phone and Petulia'has just entered. David hangs up the phone. 
PETULIA 
â¢ DAVID 
PETULIA She stops. She waits for a moment, wondering if the scene she imagined on the bus is now going to occur. Will David now say, "Just for a second there .?" 
DAVID Come on, let's eat. Morrie finally got a shipment of Dungeness crab. 
PETULIA About time. 
DAVID Well, poor guy. They had all that trouble. David crosses to the dining area. And that's that. 
32 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT NIGHT 
POLO Not right away. He's also divorced. There's alimony ... child support It looks absolutely obscene. 
â¢ 32 Continued Archie sees her. looking at his bed. 
ARCHIE 
(ANNOYED) So the kids like him, eh? 
POLO Adore him. 
ARCHIE How about that? 
33 CONTINUED LARGE GUARD with a bull horn is keeping people moving on the Japanese bridge. Many soldiers on pass, a few hippies, but mostly just tourists. 
LARGE GUARD (with bull horn) Now you folks keep moving along that bridge. You keep moving along and give other folks a chance. There's lots of pretty things to do. You keep moving right along. You won't want to forget our Niponese souvenir pagoda where every item is the real McCoy. That's right. Keep moving, that's the ticket. Sergeant, you've been standing there some time now. During this, MAY and Archie talk. '.s 32 and pretty. Its a nice day but Archie is not happy. Polo, Warren, maybe Petulia mostly it's kind of a lousy day to be a bachelor, . and May have been sitting on the grass. Gracefully she rises to her feet, doing everything just right, even this. 0 She puts away her portable martini kit. 
ARCHIE Nobody in the world can sit on the grass and not wrinkle. She looks. 
ARCHIE No, perfect. Not even a blade of grass. Why don't I marry you, May? 
MAY Why don't you, Ar^hie? They walk along holding hands. Archie should feel better than he does. 
ARCHIE Tell me about Bobby Kennedy. She looks at him, smiling. 
ARCHIE 
(SHRUGGING) Picasso? Pickles? She smiles tolerantly as they walk along. 
â¢ 33 Continued) 
ARCHIE Choose a subject. Ice cubes. Any damn thing. Take either side. Talk for thirty seconds against ice cubes. 
MAY 
(EASILY) Why the hostility, Archie? 
ARCHIE That dress shop of yours. "Boutique." I've never seen one of those ... your rubber mannequins .. I've never once seen the pipe sticking out of their bottoms. Not once, not one damn time. That bothers me, May. May stops. She doesn1t know whether to be annoyed or amused. Shets a little of both. 
ARCHIE I'm not hostile, it's frustration. In all that perfection, how could a clumsy clot like me possibly be fitted in? I mean, without spoiling the whole effect. They have now reached the area of the stunted trees. Nuns are passing through empty benches; kids are improvising on the stage and shouting. 
MAY Don't worry about it. You'll be going back to Polo. 
ARCHIE No, she's found a fellah. 
MAY Oh. She watches the kids for a moment. 
MAY I'd just about given up on you, 
ARCHIE What I should do is marry you. For May this has been said once too often. She is now 
thoroughly annoyed. 
33 CONTINUED) 
KAY Archie, if it would please you, I'll submit a list of my faults, some of which might shake you up a bit. 
ARCHIE It would be a fake list. 
MAY Probably, It wouldn't be a fake list. Actually, I wear arch supports, my depilatory causes a nasty little rash, and I've lost 10% of my hearing in less than a year .. Okay? 
ARCHIE 
OKAY; They laugh, kiss, grab at each other, and hurry toward the parking lot for Archie's car. 
34 EXT. STEPS OF ARCHIE' S APARTMENT DAY 
Petulia waits on the steps. When she is not being observed, when she is not "on," there are moments when Petulia seems utterly forlorn. This is such a moment. But then she sees Archie and May and instantly she is "with it." 
ARCHIE Well of all people. 
PETULIA All that crap about the humanitarian- ism of the medical profession. She darts alongside the building and begins frantically calling to a little old man in white duck pants and an "aloha" hat, May looks at Archie questioningly. 
ARCHIE Don't ask. Petulia and the old man are back joining Archie and May on the steps. 
PETULIA 
ARCHIE About what? 
PETULIA Well, about Polo, among other things. 
ARCHIE Polo is none of your damned business. 
PETULIA That's dumb. Dumb. She's my business and she's this lady's business. I happen to hate Polo. 
ARCHIE (to May) Needless to say she's never even met Polo. 
PETULIA I look at you and I know Polo. (to Map) Explain that to him. May looks at Archie in bewilderment, she is not quite sure how to react; but when she makes up her mind it will be the exactly right reaction. Also, in all truth, Petulia is frightened by May. 
PETULIA How many years were you married., Archie? Eight? Ten? Anyhow, the best, Wasted. Gone down the drain. 
ARCHIE Oh, come on ..o 
PETULIA Archie, we are from two different worlds. We've got nothing to agree on. Except one thing. You're a lonely screwed up mess. 0 Archie, I'm trying to save you. You're a very special man. 
0 35 CONTINUED 
ARCHIE Oh, God. 
PETULIA Tell him, May. Petulia doesn't like May's amused reaction. 
PETULIA You don't think so? 
MAY I won't put Archie on a pedestal. He'll do. 
PETULIA 
(ANGRY) You've got yourself another winner, Archie. 
MAY (to Archie) It's a joke, you're both putting me on. 
ARC HIE Petulia. I mean it. Tubas. All this E "I Love Lucy" jazz. It's only cute for awhile. 
PETULIA It's not meant to be cute. I'm fighting for your life. 
ARCHIE Who's trying to kill me? 
MAY The two million, five hundred thousand subscribers to the "Ladies Home Journal" ... right, dear? 
ARCHIE Petulia, go home and save what's his name. I really don't want to see you anymore. Archie's voice is cold. Petulia is suddenly defeated, mostly by May. She gets up and leaves. 
36 INT. HOSPITAL NIGHT 
It's after 3 a.m. and Archie is hollow-eyed and drenched 0 with sweat from an emergency operation. He is with a patient in the recovery room, obviously concerned about 
i 36 Continued the patient's chances. He crosses to a sink, bathes his face and hands with cold water. He is exhausted. As we sometimes glimpse Petulia when no one else is looking and see beyond the kookiness, so for an instant we see beyond Archie's look of professional assurance and see the fearful uncertainty. He now moves into the corridor, with each step assuming the doctor's look that is expected of him. 
PETULIA'S VOICE Hi. Archie turns. Petulia is in the medical library with books scattered all about her. 
ARCHIE You're kidding. 
PETULIA I think I've discovered a cure for cancer. 
ARCHIE Well, if you're on the brink of something. How did they let you in. 
She joins him. 
PETULIA You look exhausted. 
ARCHIE Do you know it's almost three? Doesn't Mr. Danner worry at all about things like that? Petulia looks at him reverently. 
Archie is sound asleep, breathing heavily. Petulia sits wrapped in a blanket on the floor near the window, her head resting on the sill, lonely. 
42 TNT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT Petulia is sound asleep. Through the open bedroom door we see Archie drinking a lonesome Coke. 
43 INT. ARCHIES BEDROOM NIGHT 
Petulia and Archie are both in the bed, asleep and somehow as far apart as two human beings can be. 
44 INT. ARCHIE'S BEDROOM NIGHT 
In the midst of her sleep, Petulia begins jabbering in some language all her own. Archie Is eyes open and he looks at her and he smiles. Still sound asleep, Petulia finishes her statement, whatever the hell it was and settles down on the pillow. Archie looks at her. She wakes up. They look at each other so gravely that they both begin to smile. Neither one is having the best night of their life but both are aware of a sense â¢ of tenderness that has caught them unexpectedly. 45 INT. ARCHIEtS BEDROOM MORNING Petulia wakes up suddenly. Though she is nude under the sheets, Archie is fully dressed for his day with the boys. Though his clothes are very sporty he looks anything but sporty as he talks quietly into the phone- 
ARCHIE (into phone) Okay. Wells why not do some slides anyhow? (in sudden anger) To satisfy myself, that's who. Okay. He hangs up the phone and sees Petulia looking at him. 
ARCHIE Well, we knocked off another one. Another notch in the old stethoscope. 
PETULIA You're a wonderful doctor, Archie. 
ARCHIE I keep a little black bow tie in my desk. In 0 case the services are in the morning and 1 have no time to go home. The neekband's all stained with sweat. 
45 CONTINUED 
PETULIA Why are you dressed? 
ARCHIE Have to pick up the, kids, I'm already late. 
PETULIA You're not abandoning me? I mean, I wasn't all that bad, was I? 
ARCH IE Amateur night, He leans over and kisses her mouth. 
PETULIA Before I've brushed my teeth? Are you a communist, Archie? 
ARCHIE I guess so 
PETULIA Tell Mike to watch that weight. 
ARCHIE Will you be here when I get back? 
PETULIA 
(SMILING) Dumb, Archie. Dumb. Archie starts out, then stops, troubled. 
PETULIA Yes? 
ARCHIE 
WELL 
PETULIA I'm divorcing David, if that's what you mean, 
ARC HIE 
(SHARPLY) That's none of my business. Petulia is suddenly hurt. 
PETULIA Phone me. 
ARCHIE Where? 
0 45 CONTINUED 
PETULIA Here. 
ARCHIE Listen, this worries me. Really. 
WARREN They used to think that escape from that prison was impossible. 
52B BACK TO SCENE 52 We resume with Archie and the boys. 
SI 52B Continued 
MIKE Yes, Dad. Warren told us that last week. 
ARCHIE Warren. Well, we could have gone somewhere else. I didn't know you had been. 
STEVIE (the youngest) We thought maybe you had never been, Dad. 
ARCHIE No - well, thanks, actually I haven't been before, Stevie. 
MIKE In fact, we don't call him Stevie anymore. 
ARCHIE Who doesn't? 
MIKE Mom thinks he's getting a little old for being called Stevie, in fact. 
ARCHIE I called you Stevie two weeks ago -e we were all calling you Stevie two weeks ago -- I was. 
STEVIE Before that. 
MIKE Warren says that Alcatraz taught the world you can get out of anything if you want to bad enough. 
ARCHIE That's what Warren said, eh? 
MIKE Yes, Dad. 
53 ANOTHER VIEW OF THE BOAT The boys are watching Archie who is in that section of the boat where the radar and electronic equipment are kept. Archie is on the ship telephone. He is trying to keep a straight face but since he is obviously talking to Petulia, it is difficult. 
â¢ MIKE : (to another kid) Doctors can do things like that. Call their patients from wherever they are. Archie finishes the call and returns to them, smiling. 
53 CONTINUED 
ARCHIE How about clams on the wharf when we get back? 
MIKE Clams make Steve vomit. 
ARCHIE Oh. 
MIKE You forgot that. 
ARCHIE No, it just slipped my mind. Archie really does like his kids but his thoughts are somewhere else. 
54 INT. A FISH PLACE ON THE WHARF 
While Mike and Stevie are gorging themselves, Archie is at the wall telephone. 
ARCHIE â¢ Hello there. 
LATE AFTERNOON 
55 EXT. THE BORDER GATE AT TIJUANA 
During this silent scene we watch Oliver seduce Petulia into giving him a lift in her convertible. Petulia is so bored as the cars take hours to get past the gate, Oliver is an absolute scoundrel. David is such a clod, passing out in the back seat, his legs hanging out over the door of the car, one sandal missing. His beautiful face is somehow an obscene parody of itself, fiery red from the sun. Oliver mimics David, Petulia, the guard at the gate, dances, skips, romps, annoys Petulia, makes her laugh, dares her, goads her. Finally, when Petulia's car is just one away from the border guard, Oliver impudently hops into the seat beside her, expecting to be thrown out but also expecting maybe a nickel in the bargain. But the joke's on Oliver. Petulia is even kookier than he is. Is it the look of David that sickens her? Is it her annoyance at having to wait so long and do the driving while he lies collapsed and useless? Is it that "useless" that goads her? 
55 CONTINUED Most of all Petulia is doing something of absolutely no importance; she knows Oliver will hop out of the car the moment they reach the guard. All it amounts to is two kooks having a few seconds of horsing around. The joke is on both of them -- the guard, harassed by the honking of thousands of cars and having fully inspected the car just ahead of Petulia, waves the convertible on through. Petulia stops the car a few hundred yards past the border to let Oliver climb out, but he just sits there. Petulia thinks, "okay, you little bastard . " and zooms down the highway, intending to stop at the first moment the look of superior arrogance leaves Oliver's tough little face. During this we hear Archie and Petulia's second tele- phone conversation which is as blab and loving as before. ARCHIE: Hi, there. PETULIA: Hello. ARCHIE: I'm having lunch with the boys. PETULIA: You eat a good lunch, Archie, ARCHIE: I will, I will. PETULIA: You only had a cup of coffee for breakfast. ARCHIE: I'll eat a good lunch, Petulia. PETULIA: Like what? ARCHIE: Petulia, they have a thousand different things on the menu. PETULIA: You should have a sirloin steak with french fries or baked beans. ARCHIE: Okay. PETULIA: That's easy to say, Archie, But I know you. ARCHIE: Steak with french fries or baked beans. PETULIA: Do they have fresh sea-food? ARCHIE: Yes. PETULIA: Sea bass is nice. ARCHIE: Yes, sea bass is great. PETULIA: If they grill it, ARCHIE: I'll have grilled sea bass. PETULIA: Unless they do a nice omelet. ARCHIE: I'm sure they would if I asked. PETULIA: It's such a problem. ARCHIE: Yes, I know. Goodbye, Petulia. PETULIA: Phone. 
56 INT. FISH PLACE 
Archie laughingly hangs up. He goes back to his kids. 
ARCHIE Unless you guys don't want to. 
MIKE The Roller Derby's pretty darn interesting. 
ARCHIE Yeah. 
58 CONTINUED 
MIKE We'd have to sleep over. I mean if we were going to spend the whole weekend. 
ARCHIE I want you to. 
MIKE 
(SUDDENLY) Well, it's fine by me. 
STEVIE Me toot Boy l 
ARCHIE Okay, it's a dealt Mike turns away. 
STEVIE He's going to cry I guess -- he does that. 
59 INT. ARCHIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY DAY 
Archie has had a pretty good day with the boys, is thinking â¢ about Petulia waiting in his apartment, and feels pretty damn good about the whole thing. He opens the door of his apartment. He is carrying a bag of Mexican paper flowers 
60 INT. APARTMENT 
It is empty. Archie knows at once that Petulia is gone. All the joy goes out of him. The apartment is a mess. The television set is on: a program without sound of soldiers fighting. Archie is so disappointed that Petulia isn't here. He angrily flips the dial getting the same type of program. 
ARCHIE A nice, neat kid. After all the exuberance he feels so empty. Everywhere things are scattered about. 
61 INT. BEDROOM 
The bedroom is the worst of all. The sheets and blanket have literally been stripped from the bed and flung pall mall onto the floor behind. Archie really is annoyed. Then he stops, he crosses slowly to the tangle of sheets and blanket on the floor. A lifeless arm protrudes. Archie crumples to his knees and tears at the blankets. Petulia is broken, bloodied and seemingly dead. 
61 CONTINUED Thï¿½-, phone is off the hook. Archie doesn't know where to turn first. He feels Petulia's throat for a pulse, isn't sure she has one, Petulia is wearing his hooded sweatshirt from Se. 23. Archie attempts heart massage, but Petuliats so taped up from the broken rib that this is impossible. Archie presses his mouth over Petulia's to attempt to get her breathing again. He tries this only for an instant then crosses to the phone, hangs it up and dials an emergency number. Archie goes back to Petulia. He feels again for a pulse in her throat, can find no pulse. He begins trembling. As always when a crisis really happens, it isn't as easy as the Red Cross advertisements say. Her mouth won't open right. His mouth seems unable to make the connection with hers. It all looks more like very bad love-making than a life-saving procedure. 
62 INT./EXT. HALLWAY & STEPS OUTSIDE ARCH IE' S APARTMENT 
Two special officers are moving Petulia down a hallway on 
a stretcher. A third walks behind her pressing a rubber oxygen mask over her mouth. We feel Sunday late afternoon rudely shattered, but limp- ing along nevertheless. Television, cokes, sex, stereo, facials, isometric exercises. funny-papers, ailments; boring endless Sunday late afternoon -- suddenly bloodied. Doors are opening up and down the hallway. People come out to stare. A big friendly old sheepdog wild with enthusiasm, leaps at the stretcher and almost topples Petulia. Archie, smeared with Petulia's blood, his shirt-tails out, in a state of shock himself, whams the dog as hard as he can. This entire sequence should seem like a nightmare. The dog's owner goes berserk. 
DOG'S OWNER Don't you hit Lennie! Archie is too distressed about Petulia to even respond. At every door there is a tenant. A jumble of voices all spoken together. 
1ST TENANT 0 That's sex for you. 
2ND TENANT It could be a gas leak. 
62 CONTINUED 
0 3RD TENANT She's dead. 
4TH TENANT Those rescue cops never give up. 
5TH TENANT Yes'. but they're all racists. Of course, one of the officers is a Korean and the other a Negro. All through this we have also been aware of many T.V. sets, all with programs with various kinds of violence. One youbgster comes to the door holding a portable T.V. and we see on the tube war casualties being flown out of the Jungle by helicopters. Archie has crossed ahead of the special officers to lead the way down the steps. Half a dozen "hippies"' loaded down with Chinese food and a yellow guitar are coming up the steps. Everything is chaos. The officers just can't manage the stretcher down the narrow stairway. Poor Petulia is twisted and turned every which way - all in the name of saving her life. 
7TH TENANT 
(a rich old queen in purple Bermuda shorts) I had trouble like that with my piano. Two hundred dollars to bring it through the window. And its never been the same. A record player is playing a Herb Alpert recording and the stretcher seems to move along to its rhythm. 
63 EXT. A HIGHWAY RESTAURANT NIGHT 
PETULIA Okay. He can wait inside. The cashier's a sweet old dear. I'll have him keep an eye on the ckeeky little bugger! 0 She opens the car door to take Oliver out, tense, wanting to get past this moment but fearful that she won't. 
DAVID You promised "Oliver" "San Francisco." 
PETULIA I did not. 
DAVID Like hell you didn't'. David abruptly hops over the seat and sits behind the wheel. He signals for Petulia to get in beside Oliver. Petulia hesitates. 
DAVID I dig, bitch, I dig! She's stunned. His hand reaches out and brutally jerks her into the car. 
DAVID I dig. CAMERA HOLDS on Petulia's frightened face. Now suddenly 0 the face has a tube in the nose; there's another tube in her throat; and she's unconscious. 
0 6L!. INT. EMERGENCY ROOM HOSPITAL 
Half a dozen people are working to keep Petulia alive. They're used to their work, it's no big deal for them. Actually the feeling should be that they're as relaxed as if they were mechanics working on a motor car. Archie sits on a white stool in a corner, watching everything, not as a doctor any more but as a"deeply involved man. When one of the doctors hits a vein by mistake and murmurs "Whoops ." Archie can take no more and leaves. 
65 INT. DOCTORS' SHOWER ROOM 
Archie sits on a little stone shelf, just letting the water from the shower hit him. 
BARNEY'S VOICE Hey you. Barney is looking over the shower door at Archie with a mixture of concern and anger. 
BARNEY (shouting over sound of shower) 0 Did you know there's a policeman outside wanting to talk to you? Archie nods dully. 
BARNEY What the hell is going on? Archie nods dully. 
BARNEY Can you have dinner with us tonight? Archie nods dully. 
66 INT. BARNEY' S DEN (LATE AFTERNOON) 
Barney is working the film projector showing slides of a recent holiday with Wilma and their daughter. Each slide projects an enormous colored image against an entire wall. Archie is slumped on a couch popping peanuts into his mouth. 
BARNS Y You like this new lens, Archie? Is this the greatest lens you ever saw? 
66 CONTINUED 
ARCHIE Mrnmmmm? 
BARNEY: 
(ANNOYED) What am I supposed to do -- spend the money on belly dancers?i Wilma enters from another room. She's exhausted, 
.WI LMA (to Barney) Ask me what your daughter put in her steam inhalator, 
BARNEY I don't want to know, 
WILMA Ask.me, Cottage cheese, 
BARNEY Actually I'm relieved, 
WILMA (to Archie) I'm afraid she's madly in love with your Stevie, 
ARCHIE 
(ABSENTLY Steven. Wilma looks at the pictures on the wall, 
WILMA Wasn't that a gorgeous week! I just adore Big Sur! 
BARNEY It rained every day. You kept insisting you were pregnant, 
WILMA (to Archie) You must take Polo and the boys -- She stops embarrassed, 
BARNEY Wilma-The-Magic-Talking-Machine. Put a dime in and she talks all night. 
Archie is in Petulia's little cubicle slumped on a chair, sound asleep. Petulia lies on the bed, tubes protruding from arms and neck. She is still unconscious. Archie is awakened by a nun entering the cubicle to hook up another pint of blood. Archie's presence disconcerts the nun. She can't show her annoyance openly, but is so disturbed she does her work badly this time. 
NUN Who would do such a thing to a girl like this? She's a child. Is there an orthopaedic problem, Dr. Bollen? 
Archie doesn't answer. 
NUN A. doctor should get his sleep. 
ARCHIE You left the needle in. The nun would like to scream at Archie about the impropriety of his presence here but she can't. She is proud of the bottle of blood. 
NUN From the Archbishop's Fund. 
ARCHIE Take the needle out. 
67 CONTINUED 
0 NUN All races and creeds. Why hasn't her husband been notified? 
ARCHIE I suppose they've tried. 
NUN It would be such a nice surprise to have his picture here when she finally awakens. Wouldn't that be nice? 
ARCHIE Yes, 
NUN It would give her some small comfort, 
ARCHIE I would put a bit more tape around the needle, 
NUN I mentioned her this morning in the chapel. I mention all my criticals. 
â¢ ARCHIE In the future be more careful of the needle. 
NUN She hardly makes a bump under the sheets. She leaves. Archie moves closer to Petulia examining her throat and eyes for vital signs. He pushes open an eyelid and Petulia's dead eye stares glassily into his living face. 
68 INT. HOSPITAL DAY 
We spend awhile watching Archie function as a doctor, moving through the wards, examining broken legs, arms, or whatever. In one of these scenes we pass through the orthopaedic room. 
69 INT. ORTHOPAEDIC ROOM 
Oliver is being given therapy in a whirling bath. He's only one of some twenty patients and Archie barely notices him, simply waving to him as he does to other patients who don't need his care anymore. Oliver is too frightened of the whirling bath to give a damn about the doctor. Archie goes and we stay with Oliver. 
69 CONTINUED 
OLIVER'S ATTENDANT Come on, come on, get on with it. 
70 INT. A SMALL BEDROOM IN THE DANNER HOUSE 
JUST BEFORE DAWN Three weeks ago. Oliver is wide awake, wolfing down a loaf.of bread that he has stolen from the Danner kitchen. As he gnaws on the bread, he listens to indistinct sounds from the master bedroom. moans and groans, a sudden cry, all of which he supposes are the sounds of love-making. He grins to himself in the dark. Abruptly a door opens and Petulia is coming down the hall. She has hastily put on a pair of slacks and a blouse, and is struggling into a coat. Her hair is tousled, her face filled with anguish. 
71 INT. STAIRWAY DANNER HOUSE 
Petulia is hurriedly taking the hurriedly dressed Oliver down the steps. He is protesting. Before they can reach the front door, the door of the master bedroom opens. David is standing there in his pyjama pants. 
DAVID Hey, "San Francisco"! He pronounces it like Oliver does. He comes down the steps, three at a time. He stops before the kid. 
DAVID 
(GENTLY) I sure hope there's no hard feelings. Oliver understands none of this, and of course David knows this, but it doesn't stop him. 
DAVID It isn't a question of hospitality, I want you to understand that. I feel terrible. Dragging you all the way up to San Francisco and then not even showing you Fisherman's Wharf. Comprehend.? Petulia goes into the living room to find the keys to the car. 
DA VID 0 Hold it a minute! 
MIKE It's really keen, Dad. The bell rings and Polo is standing there, She looks around, smiling. 
POLO I' don't believe it. 
STEVIE Even canteens, Mom. 0 Polo really only has eyes for Archie. She is troubled by how haggard and worn he looks. 
POLO Roller Derby starts at eight. 
STEVIE We have to police the area. 
MIKE It's really been keen, Mom. Nobody ever heard of a. camp-in. The two boys now busy themselves with straightening out the place as Polo crosses to-Archie, 
ARCHIE It's been really keen, Mom. 
POLO Poor Archie. 
ARCHIE Not "dumb" Archie? 
77 CONTINUED 
POLO Never. The brightest. I used to have such terrible anxiety that I would die suddenly. Before I could say thank you, Archie is very touched. 
STEVIE I have to go to. the latrine. Stevie goes. 
MIKE Is Dad allowed to come to the Roller Derby? I mean since Uncle Warren couldn't? He is so bad at matchmaking that Polo and Archie can hardly keep a straight face. 
78 INT. ROLLER DERBY 
The place is almost empty, but the, fans are wildly enthusiastic and are placed to look ;like thousands for the T.V. camera. The women's team is on the rink, skating, 0 banging into each other with great good-natured brutality, One of the skaters bucks another clear off the rink, smashing through the rail. The kids are in heaven, but Polo is so shocked she instinc- tively turns-to Archie and buries her face in his shoulder. Out of habit, he lets her, even touching the back of her' head' comfortingly, assuring her no fatality has occurred. Mike, the ace matchmaker, watches them with satisfaction. 
MIKE 
(SCREAMING) Don't let'that old fat butt get awa with tat; 
POLO 
(SHOCKED) 
MICHAELE 
MIKE 
FAT BUTT; 
POLO (to Archie) Will you please tell.your son -- 
78 CONTINUED 
She turns to 4rchie and sees him watching the fighting intently. The women are really brutal with each other. One small blonde lady is being, pummelled unmercifully by several others. As her head twists and turns from the forest of fists she seems to become Petulia. 
STEVIE I want to go home. 
M IKE They don't mean it. 
STEVIE I want some popcorn. 
ARCHIE I'll get it. He rises quickly and moves to the refreshment counter behind the grandstand. Archie finds a telephone booth. Polo watches him at the â¢ phone booth. Her eyes lose their warmth. The women's team races around the track. Archie returns with a box of Cracker Jacks. 
STEVIE I said popcorn. 
POLO 
(COLDLY) How is she? Dead I hope? Archie is stunned at Polo's abrupt coldness. 
MR.. DANNER'S VOICE (during preceding scene) David and I went at it hot and heavy. About the value of psychiatry. I mean sensible psychiatry. None of that "Sex- is-the-reason-for-everything" junk. It E won't ever replace a visit to the wood- shed and a good whack across the backside, but its late in the old ball game for that. 
81 JN 7-1 o PETULIA'S HOSPITAL ROOM NIGHT â¢ The nun reappears. 
NUN I'm sorry Sir, but it's time for the lady's medication. 
MR. DANNER Does anyone ever report how filthy this room is? He loses all his aplomb, He squats, he points, he finds imaginary objects on the floor. 
MR, DANNER Look at this'. Look at this! I personally raised fifty thousand dollars for this Hospital during the last campaign. You didn't know that did you; Well ask Mr, Pearl'. I mean if you knew what he looked like'. Filthy'. He gets up to go, The nun leaves, Mr. Danner brushes imaginary dust from his knees. He's perspiring, dis- hevelled, and still hasnÂ°t said what he came to say. He waits there a moment more, Finally in a flat voice 
without even looking at him: 
PETULIA Tell David, it's alright. He can come out of the cupboard. The old man almost sobs. Instead he exclaims in a jolly voice. 
MR. DANNER Chin up'. 
81A ROLLER DERBY This time we are with the T.V. CAMERAMAN, and we are looking through his scanner. We see all the excited people, but among them sit Archie and Polo, as cold as death. Suddenly, on the scanner, we see Polo rise and begin to leave tugging the two boys along with her, Archie makes no move to stop them. 
82 INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR DAY 
Archie wearing his white doctor's smock enters Petulia's room. 
83 INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
The'bed where the second patient lay is empty. In Petulia's bed is the withered old man who earlier had taken Petulia's place in the Intense Care Unit. He's quite chipper now but is in many splints and braces. 
OLD MAN I'm not sick! Don't waste time on me! Archie turns to face the nun in attendance. 
ARCHIE Where is she? 
NUN Mrs. Danner? They picked her up. Dr. Worthington said it was alright so long as she had proper nursing. 
ARCHIE Who picked her up. 
NUN Her husband I suppose. 
ARCHIE 
DANNER 
NUN They had a long talk with Dr. Worthington. He seemed entirely satisfied. 
ARCHIE They kidnapped hero He hurries down the hall. The'nun is startled. 
OLD MAN Take care of the sick people! I'm in tip-top shape! 
81E EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAY 
Archie hops off the lift as it reaches the bottom of the cliff. At the front of the house we see David and two colored men at work on the wharf. At the wharf is the yacht. Archie racies up to the nearest door and begins ringing the bell. 
85 INT. THE MASTER BEDROOM 
Petulia couldn't be lovelier, or happier. She's in a 
IS special hospital bed. There are flowers everywhere. She has her own colour T.V. set which is silently showing scenes of violence. An efficient nurse is in attendance. 
85 CONTINUED 0 The nurse is sitting at the foot of the bed, and Petulia is brushing the nurse's hair. Archie stands in the doorway overwhelmed at the normality of it all. Obviously Petulia has fixed her hair too. 
PETULIA Hi Archie. Dazedly Archie crosses to the night stand where there is a pitcher of tomato juice. Because he has nothing else to do he sniffs the tomato juice, 
PETULIA (to nurse) This is Dr. Bollen of the Hospital. He's a splendid doctor, (to Archie) This is Agnes Lillywhite. 
NURSE Our young lady is doing nicely. We have a few problems, but nothing serious. 
Petulia looks out the window and sees Archie scrambling up the cliff, She fits a curler into the nurse's hair. 
PETULIA'S VOICE Going back to the house was the only thing I could do. scenes 87A B D .,and E occur only in Petulia's mind. 
87A EXT. ATOP CLIFF DAY 
Petulia is waiting for Archie at the top of the cliff as he staggers toward her. Since everything is taking place in her mind, this is how Petulia really is. 
PETULIA 
(CONTINUING) Where else could I go? A lonely hotel room? I don't have a penny of my own. Mr. Danner promised me I'd never be left alone. I thought I'd try it for a few days. Don't be-angry. It was nobody's fault. Actually, if anyone is to blame, it's you, Archie. 
ARCHIE 
(GASPING) Me?I.o 
87B INT. FAIRMONT HOTEL NIGHT 
Petulia now recreates the moment when she first met Archie. Archie is searching through his pockets for the ticket to reclaim his coat, Petulia rushes up to him, with none of the fake nonsense of the actual meeting, but with absolute desperation. Archie is dressed as he is on the hill (Scene 86). 
PETULIA I'm Petulia Danner . save me like you saved Oliver ... save me from David! Don't lust scramble up the hill like a â¢ b oody fool o 
87B Continued Archie is stunned. 
ARCHIE I'm looking for the ticket for my raincoat. 
PETULIA 
NOL 
87C INT. PETULIA'S BEDROOM 
From her bedroom window Petulia watches Archie scramble up the hill. 
PETULIA'S VOICE Coming for me in that pokey little car. 
87D EXT. A BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY ROAD DAY 
In Petulia's mind, a great white ambulance is moving majestically through towering trees, carrying Petulia to safety. 
PETULIA'S VOICE 
(CONTINUING) 9 Why didn't you bring a proper ambulance? As though you really meant it. 
ARCHIE'S VOICE I didn't know what to do. I was going from one moment to the next. 
PETULIA'S VOICE Spectacular entrance, lousy exit. Sounds familiar, Archie. Suddenly all the anger goes out of Petulia. 
PETULIA'S VOICE: No, it's not your fault. 
87E THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE DAY Petulia dismisses the ambulance from her mind because she has something very serious to say to Archie. She is with him on the rocks below the bridge. 
PETULIA I went back to the house because I owed it to David. I have a brown thumb when it comes to men. I put them on the Cross and call them Jesus. And there they hang. I don't know why I do it. Not because of any high opinion of myself... oh, Archie, if you only knew... 
87E Continued She looks up at the bridge and instantly creates David standing there. An incredibly heroic figure in a white blazer and turtle neck sweater. Yet somehow we must sense that despite how grand David looks, at any moment in Petulia's mind he may leap to his death. 
PETULIA Look at him. Isn't he super. A six foot three Coca Cola bottle. Empty. I did that. I'd ruin you, Archie. 
87F INT. BEDROOM 
We are now back in visual reality with Petulia, and the playful David who is trying to make Petulia laugh, which she does. 
PETULIA'S VOICE David was the gentlest man I ever knew. 
FIRST GENTLEMAN Wonderful. i.sn g t - t ? They sell like hot cakes. Gives you something alive in all this stone. 
ARCHIE There must be some mistake. He sags down on a chair, draped in his research books. The two old gentlemen couldn't be more pleased. 
FIRST GENTLEMAN Mac and I get a, big kick out of people's first reaction. Its not a toy. It's a working greenhouse. You control heat and humidity with these. (he indicates dials) You've got a little bit of everything. Ornamental plants,, Zinnias, Asters. Even a little vegetable garden. The most important thing to remember is to keep the sun out. These new kind of lights work so much better, there's no comparison. 
ARCHIE You've got the wrong apartment l 
FIRST GENTLEMAN 
(CHEERFULLY) No we have not s Dr. Bollen3 
ARCHIE What screwball ...?I Then he stops, He knows what screwball. 
ARCHIE No gift card? 
FIRST GENTLEMAN It might come by mail. Archie starts chuckling. He crosses to the green- house, still chuckling. 
9L. 
95 CONTINUED 
ARCHIE This one heat, and this one humidity, right? 
FIRST GENTLEMAN Exactly. We've left a manual of operations, and wetll check everything out in a month. Okay, Dr. Bollen? 
ARCHIE (still chuckling) Okay, okay! Goodbye,' He enters the greenhouse, having to stoop almost double, as the two old gentlemen exit from the apartment. 
96 INT. GREENHOUSE 
Though extremely uncomfortable, Archie is entirely happy. Suddenly he is ripping up flowers and vegetables to make a kooky bouquet. He is positively exultant. He adds radishes and turnips to the bouquet. This is the happiest we have ever seen Archie. 
97. EXT. DANNER HOUSE DAY 
Archiets car is parked on the cliff. The Danner house is dark, deserted, abandoned. Archie is standing by himself on the wharf bouquet in hand. The yacht has gone. And so has Petulia. Archie feels utterly alone, and as a matter of fact, he is. He tosses the bouquet into the water. The lettuce floats. 
97A EXT. THE YACHT DAY 
Theoretically, we should be at some flea bag port in South America. Mostly, we SEE the yacht. 
97A Continued Petulia is sunbathing on the yacht. She looks much better now. Weeks have passed, she has a golden tan. Beside her, a transistor radio has picked up a local broadcast which would be in either Spanish or Portuguese and which consists mostly of music. David hops onto the yacht carrying a bag of groceries. He, too, is deeply tanned, marvelously healthy, but somehow uneasy. 
DAVID Hi. 
PETULIA Did you get mama on the plane all right? 
DAVID Sure. But what a dinky plane. Poor mamats stomach problems are far from over. He enters the cabin. Petulia sits up after a moment, looks about, sees no one else, then then in alarm peers into one of the windows that looks down into the cabin. 
97B INT. CABIN 
David is stowing food into the refrigerator. 
PETULIA You didn't leave papa alone in that horrible little town? 
DAVID It's not such a horrible little town. (he holds up a can) Hearts of artichokes' 
PETULIA 
(UNEASILY) David... 
DAVID? Take your "Vitamer Zed," you blinkint Limey. 
0 97B Continued He uses the English way of saying "vitamin," and then a bit too rakishly he tosses an orange up through the window. Instinctively, Petulia makes an effort to catch, misses, and it hits her lightly on the shoulder. Though it causes no damage,'David is suddenly in terror. He races up out of the cabin to Petulia. 
(CONTINUING) I didn't.want him to leave. 
PETULIA All right, David. 
â¢ DAVID "All right, David," through chattering teeth. Petulia crawls under the sheet of a bunk. 
DAVID Only a crazy man hits a woman. Or a coward. T won't ever again. I'd stick my hand into a garbage disposal. I would, Petulia. I'd grind it up, Petulia lies under the sheet, silent, rigid, David abruptly crosses to a cabinet and takes out a signal flare pistol. He snaps in a flare and tosses it at Petulia. She sits up in panic. 
DAVID Hang on to it. If I come for you let me have a flare. Between the eyes. I'll melt in ten seconds. Petulia is touched. 
97E Continued ï¿½ï¿½;IULï¿½iA I couldn't do that, Youtre too beautiful to melt. 
DAVID (suddenly angry) Girls are beautiful, 
PETULIA 
(GRINNING) So are centaurs, unicorns, minataurs,0. 
DAVID 
(GRINNING) , ,astron.uts, short order cooks, trumpet players,,, 
PETULIA Cavalry officers, aging poets, men of science,,. They are enjoying the nonsense. Then on "Men of Science': 
0 97F DAVID'S IMAGE: His finger is pressed against the doorbell over which is the nameplate "DR, A. BOLEN." The door finally opens and Petulia is standing there in Archie's hooded sweatshirt. Her eyes widen in terror as David enters Archie's apartment. She knows he has come here to kill her, 97G The image ends. David is abruptly withdrawn, but Petulia is carried away by memory. 
PETULIA The first time I saw you, you were being charming to- somebody who didn't buy a boat after all, You were wearing a light blue turtleneck sweater. Your sunglasses wÂ®re'pushed up into your hair. You had sandals, but'-no socks. Trying. to sell a forty foot yacht without socks. I had never seen anything so perfect. "He's not real. He's one of those plastic gadgets Americans do so well. Ah, but I want one."

98 CONTINUED Then Petulia sees Archie beside her bed. He is wearing his hospital jacket which gives him the run of the place. 
PETULIA They can't keep any secrets around here. 
ARCHIE When did you get back? 
PETULIA A year ago. You didn't forget me, 
ARCH IE How could I? All those laughs. He dabs a Kleenex on her sweat-beaded face. 
ARCHIE So, Things go better with Mr. and Mrs. Danner, 
PETULIA Obviously, They look at each other tenderly. 
PETULIA Why did you let me get away? 
ARCHIE Bad timing. Dumb Archie. 
PETULIA Girls like me are very rare, Archie Archie cannot endure this, 
ARCHIE 
(SUDDENLY) I could.call an ambulance. Take you to a private hospital in Oakland. If we didn't make it in time, so what, I don't know how many babies I delivered as an intern.

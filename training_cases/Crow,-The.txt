FADE IN: 
EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON 
BOOM!  A crack of lightning illuminates the silhouette of a perched crow large in the f.g. 
TIGHT ANGLE - FRESH GRAVE 
As a spade smooths the walls of a new double-decker plot. 
DIMITRI (O.S.) We're losing the light; let's pack it in. 
ANGLE - DIMITRI AND ALEXI 
TWO GRAVEDIGGERS.  Scoop digger parked f.g. towering gothic- style church b.g.  Rolls of astro turf.  They look up toward the sky. 
ALEXI Snow, maybe? 
DIMITRI What, you gonna ski on this? 
He indicates the mound of fresh dirt.  Spits into the grave. 
DIMITRI (CONT'D) Come on, let's bag this.  It's beer time. 
Alexi nods and unfurls the tarp over the dirt. 
LOW ANGLE TRACKING SHOT - FLOWERS ON GRAVES 
As we MOVE alongside a pair of canvas-sided combat boots, as the wearer collects the most lively flowers from each grave in sequence. 
TIGHT ANGLE - THE CROW 
Cemetery DEFOCUSED b.g.  Large, glossy-black, the bird follows the arc of movement in the previous shot.  Ruffles its feathers as it begins to sprinkle rain. 
ANGLE - ELLY - RESUMING HER MOTION 
A dirty-blondish tenement KID of eleven, clad in a blend of cast- offs and hand-me-downs; her version of street punk chic.  She totes a skateboard under one arm (itself a berserk Jackson Pollock chaos of band stickers, silver marker and graffiti, with day-glo wheels), and transfers her impromptu bouquet so she may unzip a flap and hike up a ragged hood against the rain.  She stops to watch the grave diggers pack up and EXIT b.g. 
ELLY Guess the picnic got rained out. 
She looks down o.s. at -- 
ANGLE - SHELLY WEBSTER'S GRAVE 
as Elly places the gathered flowers down.  Almost reverent. 
RESUME CROW ANGLE - ELLY B.G. 
as Elly takes a single white rose and places it atop the grave near Shelly Webster's. 
ANGLE ON GRAVE - AS ELLY LEAVES 
TILT UP from rose to the name: ERIC DRAVEN. Rain spatters the granite, darkening it. 
EXTREME CLOSE-UP - CROW's EYE 
It blinks in its alien way. 
WITH THE CROW 
as it takes wing from it's unseen perch.  Lands stop Eric's headstone.  It pecks tentatively at the top of the monument. 
ANGLE - ELLY NEAR ERIC'S GRAVE 
She hasn't gotten too far before she notices the bird. 
ELLY Oh, scary. 
The bird blinks at her from the headstone. ELLY What are you, like, the night watchman? 
Another blink from El Birdo. 
CAMERA WITH ELLY -  BOOMING BACK HIGH 
as she exits the iron gates of the cemetery without looking back.  Brutal building facades, like dead eyes, and bad alleyways, like hungry mouths, are gradually revealed as we continue PULLING BACK to unveil that the cemetery is smack in the middle of the city. 
ALBRECHT Here now!  You're gonna be okay! Can you understand me?  I'm a police officer... 
The woman is no longer in pain.  Deathly calm now. 
WOMAN He touched me and it stopped.  The pain. 
ALBRECHT What did you say? 
WOMAN I saw a ghost... 
Her eyes roll back and she dies in Albrecht's arms. 
ALBRECHT Oh no... don't go, darlin', you stay with me, now... shit! 
HIGH ANGLE CROW POV - THE ALLEY 
BOOMING BACK from Albrecht, the woman, onlookers, as police units screech up to assist. 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND ARCADES GAMES SUPPLY HOUSE - ON ERIC - NIGHT 
Eric in lurching flight, panting.  Stops and steadies against the wall across from the backside of Arcade Games. 
ANGLE - THE CROW (FLYING) 
Circling, then lighting on the fire escape above Eric. 
BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES - ("CROWVISION") 
"CROWVISION" is what the crow "gives" Eric to see.  Visually distinct and immediately identifiable. 
ERIC'S POV - BACK WINDOWS OF ARCADE GAMES 
Which he's already seen through the crow's eyes. 
ANGLE - ERIC 
looking up at the crow.  Disoriented.  Doesn't understand. Suddenly he cottons, and covers his eyes just in time to shield from: 
ANGLE - BACK OF ARCADE GAMES 
The rear windows EXPLODING outward in a spray of fire and debris. 
ANGLE - WITH ERIC 
he reels back, crashes into a dumpster.  Falls. 
ANGLE - THE CROW 
landing on the dumpsters edge near a pair of discarded combat boots in the trash.  Flames. 
LOW ANGLE - ERIC 
The blood from his hands mars his burial shirt.  He tears the shirt away, leaving his tie absurdly intact.  Wipes his face with his shirt.  Discards it.  Stops, held by his discovery -- 
PUSH IN ON ERIC 
as his fingers explore the five puckered bullet punctures in his chest.  Almost a circle.  Comically, he feels his back foe exit wounds.  Then hauls himself upright, coming level with the crow. His glance at the bird is almost accusatory. 
ANGLE - THe CROW 
Inscrutable.  We should get the idea that some silent communication is taking place. 
ANGLE - ERIC'S FEET 
bare, muddied, frozen.  TILT to Eric.  His gaze moves from the crow to the boots in the trash.  He grabs them, pushes them onto his bare feet.  His eyes catch the firelight.  Distant o.s. SIRENS 
ERIC Fire.  In the rain. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CLUB TRASH - NIGHT 
We are now within the neon techno-depths of Club Trash.  The BG music is hard, savage, primal:  a doom-laden Radio Werewolf band rules.  Cabaret Blitzkrieg, packed with Death-to-Yup trendazoids.  We'll see more of this circus later.  Right now the BG SOUND is our biggest clue to the flavor of this establishment since we are -- 
TIGHT CLOSE-UP A FRAMED 8X10 
Thinly filmed in dust, mounted among dozens of other band shots. Visible among the posed members of a group called Diabolique is Eric, wielding guitar on the club stage.  ND BLUR as people CROSS FRAME. 
GRANGE, 45-50, powerful, a seasoned assassin, cruel but loyal. His facade remains stony as he leads three other men briskly down the corridor.:  NGO NWA, 50ish, clad Chinese gangster style - white topcoat, white scarf, tinted shades - and two body guards supplying a power perimeter around him,lean, dark-haired Asian killers who would gladly die for Ngo Nwa, which they will in just a minute. 
They have just passed the Diabolique 8X10.  Ngo Nwa's gloved fingers, in passing, leave little skid tracks in the dust that clear the eyes of Eric in the photo. 
As the foursome reaches the DOOR, Grange turns doubtfully -- suspiciously -- to Nwa. 
NGO NWA He will see me... unannounced. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE DOOR 
As Grange keys in the enter code the door hisses open.  Without a word, Nwa passes inside and the door is pulled shut in Grange's face by the Bodyguards, who post themselves to either side. 
Skank riles 
SKANK Hey, blow me, fat boy! 
Just as quick, Gideon cocks and levels a Magnum at Skank. 
GIDEON Blow yourself, bigmouth. 
T-BIRD (interposing) Whoa, hey, whoa. (hands up) Business. 
He lifts a small carton onto the counter. 
GIDEON Whatcha got? 
NEW ANGLE - COUNTER 
Transaction time.  T-Bird passes items through the screen slot and Gideon gives each one cursory, doubtful inspection. 
T-BIRD Coupla more rings... 24k. 
GIDEON 18k.  Crap. 
T-BIRD ...necklace... pearls... 
GIDEON Nineteen bucks at Sears.  Fake, 
T-BIRD Leather purse... 
He hands though the bag rested from the woman. 
GIDEON What's this -- a little, ah, bloodstain, right? (doesn't matter) Fifty bucks for the box, and I'm doin' you a -- 
T-BIRD Yeah, I know, fatso.  Do us all a favor.  Make Top Dollar smile. 
SKANK You wouldn't want Top Dollar not to smile. 
Mention of Top Dollar clams Gideon efficiently up.  He hands over the cash to T-Bird with a grimace. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - ON ERIC - NIGHT 
Eric stares upward at the crow as it drops like a bomber from the night sky, flying past him, skimming the roof, leading him on.  Eric exhales, shrugs, feeling mocked by the bird. 
ERIC All right. 
And he takes off on a run.  Only to stumble and fall.  But the falls turns into a TUMBLING ROLL that lands Eric back on his feet still moving.  He looks back as if to ask: "Did I do that?" and runs out of the frame. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - PICKING UP ERIC ON THE RUN. 
as he squints towards the crow and does his best to keep up. TRACK WITH HIM to the edge of the roof, heavily misted in rain. 
He jumps a negligible gap to the next lower roof.  The next roof-top is a one-story jump down.  Eric clears the jump with a WOOF of air.  Keeping his eyes on the flying crow; gaining strength.  His next leap is more like a broad-jump.  Athletic. 
FAST MOVING ANGLE - THE CROW 
keeping airborne, keeping ahead. 
MOVING ANGLE - ERIC 
Eyes confidently on the sky as he arches out into space... 
UP ANGLE FROM STREET - BUILDINGS 
As Eric is seen to jump across the gap at least three stories up where there is no connecting building. 
CLOSE ANGLE - TARGET BUILDING LEDGE 
as Eric smashes into it, just missing, hinging at the waist, grabbing for purchase, suddenly panicked, gravity pulling him downward. 
ANGLE - AT ERIC FROM PHONE CABLE BRACKET 
Eric falls but manages to grab the bracket one-handed.  He hangs for another deadly moment, then slowly, to his own astonishment, executes a one-handed pull-up that will save his ass. ERIC Gotcha. 
He completes the pull-up, bringing his chin level with the ledge.  As he reaches for it with his other hand the bracket rips from the wall and Eric plummets, with a howl of defeat. 
UP ANGLE FROM STREET - ERIC'S DOWNFALL 
It's a looooooong way down. 
ANGLE - ALLEYWAY 
as Eric lands and splits a trash can in two.  A beat as we wonder if any bones are left unpulped.  PUSH IN as Eric rolls from facedown to his back. 
TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE 
as he completes the roll, gasping, amazed he's still in one piece. 
ANGLE - TRASHCAN - ON THE CROW 
It flies easily down to inspect Eric as he slowly sits up, examining his hands.  Frustrated and pissed off. 
FUNBOY (O.S.) Hey, Darla -- before we die of old age, how about it --? 
DARLA (to Elly) Out.  Now.  I gotta work. 
RACK PAST Darla and MOVE IN CLOSE on a corner table -- where sit Funboy, Skank, T-Bird and a black, vested muscle gypsy, TIN-TIN. 
INT. LOFT - NIGHT 
As Eric shoves the door open from the outside.  The lock, popped from the frame, spins on the wooden floor.  The barrier tape whisps and dust roils.  Dark, chilly, damp.  A rat's nest of disuse. 
PULL BACK THROUGH THE BROKEN PICTURE WINDOW 
as Eric enters.  Glass blown out.  Shards poking.  Jagged. 
NEW ANGLE - AS ERIC WALKS IN 
He scans the loft.  Sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor. 
ERIC'S POV - FLOOR NEAR WINDOW 
A white, long-haired cat walks into a pool of night light. 
ANGLE - ERIC AND THE CAT 
He kneels.  Extends his hand.  The cat nears; likes Eric. 
CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND. 
as the cat makes contact.  Sudden white jolt - a FLASH. 
FLASH:  we HEAR Eric strumming his Strat o.s.  We see what he saw:  Shelly, holding the cat. 
FLASH ENDS. 
UP ANGLE - ERIC 
Wincing.  Recovering from the flash.  He purposefully gathers the cat into his arms and braces for more, harder, stronger... 
FLASH:  A MAN and a WOMAN make love on a big bed amidst a hundred points of candlelight.  Shelly and Eric, once upon a time. 
FLASH ENDS. 
REVERSE ANGLE FROM BEDROOM DOOR - ON ERIC 
as the cat, dropped, hits the floor and scrambles out of the way. 
CLOSE-UP - ERIC 
vising his head, teary-eyed, his nose bleeding. 
ERIC No!  Don't look!  No! No! 
He whirls unexpectedly and punches his fist completely through the masonry wall. FLASH:  Eric and Shelly in a mock waltz.  He spins her and they collapse on the bed. 
FLASH ENDS. 
ANGLE - ERIC 
slowly pulling his arm out of the wall. 
ERIC (whispering) Stop it. 
His eyes roll up and he slumps the length of the door frame like a drowning man. 
ANGLE - GABRIEL 
watching Eric.  He hits with an o.s. THUD. 
INT. THE PIT - ON FUNBOY'S TABLE - NIGHT 
As a gloved hand sets up four bullets next to four shots. 
FUNBOY (O.S.) Let's have some fun. 
Funboy pops the bullet, like a contact capsule and washes it down. T-Bird turns to Tin-Tin, the new guy. 
T-BIRD	You first. 
TIN-TIN You're outta your fuckin' mind. 
Into it, almost jazzed, Tin-Tin downs his bullet and shot, and T-Bird does likewise.  Points to Skank. 
T-BIRD No.  I'm not the lunatic.  He is. 
Skank riles, pulls a huge Auto Mag and sticks it in T-Bird's face, cocking. 
SKANK Fuck you, T-Bird. 
Just as lightning fast, T-Bird has his own gun out and jammed right under Skank's jawbone.  He makes a kissy face. 
Weirdly distorted, a shared vision between Eric and the crow. 
TIGHT ON ERIC 
As he DUCKS out of the path of the knife he sees through the bird's eyes.  He rolls. 
ON THE CROW 
It hops out of the way as the knife embeds in the wall.  Eric's ROLL finishes him up nearby. 
ERIC Goddammit. 
He grabs for the knife as if to use it on the Skull Cowboy, but the knife causes an unexpected painful FLASH. 
FLASH:  Eric bouncing off the bedroom doorframe, Tin-Tin's knife stuck in his shoulder. 
FLASH ENDS. 
RESUME ERIC 
vising his head with his hands, in pain.  Too much pain. 
SKULL COWBOY Get it? 
ERIC Leave me alone -- ! 
He looks up, the Skull Cowboy is still there. 
SKULL COWBOY (contempt) Do something about it. ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND THE SKULL COWBOY. 
A horrible beat between them.  The Eric runs full tilt across the room, bounding to the open window and then leaping. 
ANGLE - SKULL COWBOY 
as close to surprise as he gets.  Steps out to watch as -- 
ANGLE ON WINDOW - ERIC 
FLIES feet first out into space. 
CLOSE-UP - BRICKWORK ABOVE WINDOWFRAME 
Eric's fingers smash into grip the tiny mortared gaps! 
EXT. LOFT BUILDING - UP ANGLE FROM STREET - NIGHT 
High above, Eric's feet shoot out the window, knocking loose stray shards that fall toward frame.  He swings into an upside- down pose, impossibly holding himself rigid against the building's side, face down. by his quarter-inch finger grip. 
CLOSE-UP - ERIC 
Every muscle rigid, quivering with tension.  Hold.  Then he relaxes, and swings back inside. 
INT. LOFT - AT WINDOW, PICKING UP ERIC - NIGHT 
He arches, flips, to land on his feet.  The Skull Cowboy is gone.  No knife either.  The crow watches.  O.S. "meow". 
ANGLE - WITH ERIC AS HE TURNS TO SEE THE CAT 
ERIC I guess I'm not ready to leave... just yet. 
He picks up the cat -- wary of flashes, which don't come this time -- and returns to the window.  Feeling safer. 
ERIC (CONT'D) The last time we saw each other, I didn't do so well. (holds cat up) Huh, Gabriel? 
He moves to the fireplace.  With his free hand, lifts the Tragedy mask off its hook.  Puzzles it, fact-to-mask. 
ERIC (CONT'D) I bet you need some cat food... right? 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT -ESTABLISHING: 
Eric walking, the Tragedy mask hanging from his hip.  An occasional PEDESTRIAN passes without comment, brutalized by the city.  Eric, more confident, smells the night's bouquet. 
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT ("CROWVISION") 
Two men around a trashcan fire.  We should recognize Tin-Tin by his black leather trench coat.  A wonderfully rude Rap tune, "Got a White WOman Tied Up In My Closet, Gonna Jab Her With A Stick," RAZZLES b.g. 
EXT. STREET - RESUMING ERIC - NIGHT 
As Eric reacts to what the crow has just seen.  Slows.  Stops. And directs his attention toward the mouth of the alley. 
EXT. ALLEY - TIGHT ON TIN-TIN - NIGHT 
He pulls the nickel plated revolver from the satchel.  FOLLOW as he hands it across to RATSO, who removes the suitcase-sized boom box (the source of the music) from his shoulder to accept. Ratso is a feral skull-head; street trash. 
TIN-TIN Three hundred and your a gunslinger. 
HIGH ANGLE - TIN-TIN and RATSO 
As the crow is still watching, yet perched.  A brief shove-and-standoff.  The gun deal has gone bad. 
ERIC Halloween is coming.  The Day of the Dead... 
In the mirror, multi Eric's.  He touches the glass, tightening up as he realizes he's in for another -- 
FLASH:  Shelly, sleeping on her divan, a year ago, wakes as Eric (O.S.) says "Boo".  She cracks an eye open. 
SHELLY Your scary quotient needs work. 
FLASH ENDS. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY 
Considering old cosmetics.  Everything he touches will hurt him. But he's ready to eat this pain.  He grabs a lipstick. 
FLASH:  Shelly at the vanity in happier times 
SHELLY I think red's my color, don't you? 
FLASH ENDS. 
RESUME ERIC 
wincing.  He drops the lipstick on the floor.  Grabs a hairbrush. 
FLASH:  Eric smashes into the street after his death-fall, trailing broken glass. 
FLASH ENDS. 
NEW ANGLE - ERIC AT VANITY 
Later.  He's wearing white pancake makeup on his cheeks.  Shaky. 
FLASH:  Eric sucks up Funboy's gunshots in the chest.  1-2-3-4. 
FLASH ENDS. 
RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY 
his face a crazy warpaint maze of white streaks, not blended yet.  He looks at his own reflection.  In one cracked, triangular facet of the mirror is not a multiple of his face, but the Skull Cowboy.  Just one. 
SKULL COWBOY Glad to see you're finally with the program. 
ERIC Bugger off to the graveyard, skull- face, I'm busy. 
SKULL COWBOY You work for the dead.  Forget that, and you can forget it all. 
The Cowboy tips his hat and isn't there.  Eric sees the crow perched on the edge of the mirror now. 
ERIC Forget this. 
He smears the streaks until his face is uniformly grave-wave white. 
ANGLE - GABRIEL THE CAT 
coming in to sniff around the clutter at the foot of the vanity. Eric looks down towards him... and toward the lipstick he dropped. 
CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S HAND 
as it glides down to pick up the lipstick.  CONTACT, and -- 
FLASH:  Eric, smashed on the street, T-Bird's car b.g., upside down in Eric's POV as he rolls over and blood courses from both corners of his mouth,  a definite foreshadow of the "Crow" face. 
FLASH ENDS. RESUMING ERIC AT VANITY - TIGHT 
ERIC She always red red was her color. 
EXTREME CLOSE - THE MIRROR 
We see only a reflected corner of Eric's mouth as he duplicates the blood trail in red lipstick, making one one half of a crow harlequin smile. 
EXT. LOFT BUILDING - LATER - NIGHT 
A MEDIUM SHOT as lightning strikes; a storm brews. 
EXT. LOFT - LATER - NIGHT 
CLOSE-UP - ERIC'S BOOTS 
crossing the floor.  Tin-Tin's knife slotted to the bucklework. 
CLOSE-UP - VANITY 
Eric's hands discard a hairbrush there.  He moves off. 
CLOSE-UP - GABRIEL 
looking up o.s., watching his master stalk around with purpose. Thunder rumbles long o.s. 
ANGLE - AT ERIC IN WINDOW FROM OUTSIDE 
Gideon crashes into the counter cage.  As Eric advances on him: 
ERIC I'm looking for something in an engagement ring.  Gold. 
As Eric comes up behind him, Gideon reaches through the open cage door and pulls a big combat knife from beneath the counter. 
GIDEON You're looking for a coroner,shit- for-brains! 
And he tries to nail Eric with the knife. 
NEW ANGLE - BEHIND GIDEON - AS GIDEON SWINGS 
No Eric behind him.  TILT to reveal Eric hanging off the cage above Gideon.  Eric slams the cage door against Gideon's head. Drops down like a spider and collects the knife. 
ERIC I repeat: a gold engagement ring. It was pawned here, a year ago, by another gentleman whose name, I believe was... "T-Bird"? 
IN TIGHT ON ERIC AND GIDEON 
Eric twists Gideon's sail-like shirt and Gideon turns bright red. 
ERIC (CONT'D) Cute nickname, don't you think? 
GIDEON (gasping) I ain't got no fuckin' ring. 
ERIC Wrong answer. 
Eric nails Gideon's hand to the counter top.  Gideon howls! 
GIDEON All's I got is in a box!  Behind the counter! 
Eric jumps through the cage door.  Gideon's eyes bug as he sees his own pierced hand, immobilized. 
ANGLE - ON ERIC BEHIND THE COUNTER 
scans the shelves.  Rows of boxed ammo.  Kerosene tins.  A shotgun. Knives and assorted knuckle duster curios.  And the ring box. 
CLOSE-UP - THE RING BOX IN ERIC'S HAND. 
Dozens of gold rings.  Eric's fingers sift through them. 
TIGHTER ON ERIC 
He brings each ring to his face.  INTERCUT with Gideon's feeble struggles and invective, o.s. 
ERIC No... no... no... no... 
He tosses each rejected ring over his shoulder.  Until: 
CLOSE-UP - THE RING IN ERIC'S HAND 
Obliterated by a stab of brilliant white light -- 
FLASH:  Shelly's face.  A perfect vision... 
FLASH ENDS. 
RESUMING ERIC 
He closes his fist tightly around the ring.  A moment of decision.  Then he draws the shotgun from beneath the counter. Uses the butt to knock the knife free of Gideon's hand.  It goes spinning across the countertop.  Eric shucks the shotgun and rams it into Gideon's nose as the big man slumps to the floor. 
ERIC Tin-Tin confided in me, before he ran out of breath.  You have one chance to live. GIDEON No fucking way.  He'll kill me. 
ERIC Who would waste time killing you... besides me? 
Gideon sweats, pants, contemplates the hole in his hand. 
GIDEON (cowed) Top Dollar. 
ERIC Another jolly nickname? 
GIDEON You want those assholes, you want Top Dollar. 
ERIC T-Bird? 
GIDEON Like the car.  He hangs out with Skank. that little ass-hair, and they hang at the Pit -- hell, Funboy lives there.  Ask Top Dollar. 
ERIC A whole club of pirates, with pirate names... 
Eric seems to go berserk, SMASHING and PUNCTURING cans of flammables and powder while Gideon flinches, nursing his holed hand.  Blows just miss Gideon's head.  Soon he's cowering. 
LOW ANGLE - ERIC 
Looking down at Gideon in revulsion. 
ERIC You feed off the living. 
SMASH!  as another tin ceases to exist next to Gideon.  Then Eric is gone, past him without further word, ignoring him entirely.  As he exits, shotgun shouldered, he pauses to admire a white Fender Strat hanging among the pawnables.  He reaches for it. 
ON GIDEON 
and the silhouette.  Mouth hangs. 
ALBRECHT You're the one who did Tin-Tin... 
PULL BACK FAST to reveal Eric is gone from the frame.  Albrecht does a quick 180.  No Eric.  Flashbars from incoming units begin to bounce red and blue off his face. 
ALBRECHT (CONT'D) Great.  Good night.  Guy shows up looking like a mime from hell. (beat) Least he didn't do that "walking against the wind" shit;  I hate that. 
EXT. SHOWTIME - NIGHT - TO ESTABLISH. 
A night-owl pornucopia.  T-Bird enters beneath a garish theater marquee.  The 2-bill:  RUMP ROMP with BUTTBUSTERS II. 
INT. SHOWTIME LOBBY - NIGHT 
T-Bird approaches the snack bar.  Wet, breathy mating NOISES from the auditorium throughout, o.s.  Looking supremely bored, the counterman, DICKEY BIRD, thumbs a porn tabloid.  So what. 
DICKEY BIRD T-Bird.  Thrill me. 
T-BIRD Business. 
T-bird heads left through s steal door that Dickie buzzes open for him. 
INT.  SHOWTIME AUDITORIUM (BACKSTAGE) - NIGHT 
T-Bird walks past dust-covered boxy black speakers as we glimpse Lance and Angelique making history in reverse, on the back of the movie screen: oratoria as good as porn films can make it. 
PORN QUEEN (O.S.) I don't know how to describe how I feel, Lance -- so restless -- 
PORN KING (O.S.) You're my Moon Queen, Angelique. 
PORN QUEEN (o.S.) Oooh -- I want you're rocket right now in my Sea of Tranquility -- Lance -- 
ANGLE - CATWALK STAIRS 
As T-Bird approaches, the movie sounds dwindle o.s.  He ascends the skinny metal stairway two steps at a time. 
ANGLE - STEEL FACED DOOR AT TOP OF STAIRS. 
As T-Bird nears it, a viewplate SNAPS open to asses him.  By the time he reaches the top, the door unbolts to admit him. 
INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT 
As T-Bird enters.  The room is organized around a long meeting table and flavored with a taste of everything illegal:  drug paraphernalia, weapons. 
Across the table are a couple of Sentries like the one that admits T-Bird to the room.  TRACK PAST them to a lank-haired silhouette as he turns away from a windowshade, backlit by Showtime's exterior neon. 
This is TOP DOLLAR.  Who looks like a Johnny Winter acid casualty but is deadly cold, definitely the man in charge. 
TOP DOLLAR Wild fucking night.  I hear our pal Tin-Tin got himself very dead. 
T-BIRD And Gideon's just burned all the down to the foundation. 
Top's eyebrows go up.  Oh really? 
T-BIRD (CONT'D) I didn't have nothin to do with that. 
TOP DOLLAR Bet that pisses you off, right? 
T-BIRD Top, what the fuck is going on tonight? 
TOP DOLLAR Stay normal, T.  Cops'll be all hotwired and aggressive.  No combat moves until I check this out. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT - (~CROWVISION") HIGH ANGLE 
Taking in the street, the Pit, and a little girl seated on an abandoned car. 
ANGLE - STREET LEVEL - ON ELLY. 
Seated on the looted wheelless car, playing with a small doll. 
CLOSER ANGLE - ON ELLY 
She doesn't notice someone is watching her yet. 
TIGHT ON DOLL, THEN ELLY 
She looks up o.s. at Eric, who is still out of the frame. 
ELLY What are you supposed to be?  A clown? 
CLOSE-UP - ERIC 
He smiles for what seems to be the first time.  Warm, even past his crow makeup. 
ERIC Sometimes. 
He glances back and logs the location of the Pit for later, not in a big hurry just now.  Turns back to Elly. 
WIDE ANGLE - ERIC AND ELLY 
FUNBOY (CONT'D) BANG!  He shoots, he scores! 
Then his expression drags a little bit. 
ANGLE - ERIC 
Looking down and daubing his hand in the bullet wound on his chest. 
ERIC Bull's eye.  Good shot. 
ANGLE - DARLA 
who starts scrambling to get out.  Grabbing clothes on the floor around herself. she runs right into Eric's outstretched hands. 
ERIC Stay. 
Eric twists her arm. 
CLOSE-UP - DARLA'S FOREARM. 
where we may clearly see the needle tracks. 
UP ANGLE - ERIC 
ERIC Morphine is bad for you. 
He holds her arm captive.  Tight, and we PUSH IN CLOSER to see the dope evacuating from the punctures, a reverse of Eric's, Blood trail.  The dope drips from Darla's arm to the floor. Darla's eyes roll up into the unconscious.  She slumps. 
ANGLE - ON FUNBOY - GAWPING 
FUNBOY How the hell did you do that? ERIC Magic. 
Funboy regards Eric's battlescars and guitar. 
FUNBOY Either die or do a solo. 
Eric looks briefly to his chest wound, wincing.  He can't seem to make it tie off fast enough.  He turns his attention back to Funboy.  But his strength is mysteriously ebbing. 
ERIC Neither. 
FUNBOY Yeah, I got a more fun idea myself. 
Funboy lashes out and broadsides Eric across the temple with the gun.  Eric falls, rolls back to a stance, but Funboy is right on top of him, howling like a lunatic and pistol-whipping Eric relentlessly. 
FUNBOY I hate trespassers! (whack!) I hate prowlers! (whack!) I hate peeping toms! (whack!) And right now I hate you! 
ANGLE - WALL NEAR BATHROOM 
as Eric, caught off-guard by Funboy's hyper high and weakened by his wound, comes slamming into the wall, losing his footing. Here comes Funboy, and we TILT UP from Eric's position as he looms, cocking the pistol, which now has Eric's blood on it. 
FUNBOY Ahh, the hell with it, I still got five shots left. 
In a blur, Eric grabs Funboy`s gun hand.  Twists to the crunching of bones.  Funboy's skewed-around gun hand blows a hole in his own thigh.  Funboy fall back across the bed. 
FUNBOY Owwwaaaa -- fuck me!  Look what you did to my sheets, you lame piece'a shit!  AAAAaa!  Goddd! 
ERIC Does it hurt? 
FUNBOY Does it hurt?!  You dead-ass, clown-faced fuck, of course it fucking hurts!  What the shit are you gonna do about this?! 
Eric sits on the bed next to Funboy; inspects the ampule of morphine on the nightstand, the needle of the syringe already inserted. 
ERIC I have some pain killer right here. 
And he fills the syringe all the way. 
ANGLE ON FUNBOY 
as he begins to see the light.  He can't get away.  Growing terror. 
FUNBOY No, wait, no WAIT, that's too much, man, that's like overkill, nobody can take that much, you're wasting it -- ! 
ERIC Your pain ends now. 
And Eric rams the needle into Funboy's heart, driving home the full dose.  Funboy begins to convulse. 
Eric falls back on the bed, his force spent.  Darla COMES TO in the corner, shock-traumatized.  On O.S. COUGH, and Eric opens his eyes. 
The Skull Cowboy, standing in the room, tips his hat. 
SKULL COWBOY Howdy (beat) You look a mess.  Like an ole cooter dog. 
TIGHT SHOT - ERIC'S FACE 
streaked with -- mostly -- his own blood. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - THE SKULL COWBOY AND ERIC 
SKULL COWBOY Getting a little ambitious and extracurricular, aren't we? 
ERIC (CONT'D) Walk with me. 
As Albrecht comes up with the file as they walk. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT ON THE STREET 
ALBRECHT You died, man.  I can't believe it but here you are.  Last year, you and your girlfriend -- 
ERIC I need you to tell me what you remember.  What happened to us? 
ALBRECHT You went out the window.  She was beaten and raped.  She died in the hospital. 
They stop.  Eric didn't know this.  Fixes Albrecht with a look. 
ALBRECHT (CONT'D) Hey, you asked, man. (beat) She held on for thirty hours in intensive care.  Hemorrhage, trauma.  He body just finally gave it up. (beat; regret) I saw it and couldn't do jack for her. 
Eric has grown increasingly distraught over Albrecht's lines. Now he turns to Albrecht and, holding Albrecht's temples with his fingers, puts his thumbs over Albrecht's eyes. 
TIGHT ON ERIC - ALBRECHT AGAINST WALL 
We see Eric react to a brutal Flash... but we don't see the Flash. 
NEW ANGLE - ERIC AND ALBRECHT 
And Eric tears from Albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own head.  His crow face slacked in realized horror. 
ALBRECHT You okay, man?  I mean, what just happened. 
ERIC The venom of bad memories.  You were there; you saw her.  I saw you seeing her. 
Understandable nervous, Albrecht lights up a cigarette. 
ALBRECHT You gotta understand -- I was hoping she'd talk, give me a lead, a clue, something to work with. But she only said one thing to me before she died. 
Eric lowers his head, penitent. 
ERIC My name. 
ALBRECHT (fizzles) I'm sorry as hell, man. 
ERIC Thirty hours.  A day of life, plus change... 
TIGHT TWO-SHOT - ALBRECHT AND ERIC 
Eric plucks the cigarette from Albrecht's lips, taking a single contemplative puff from it. 
ERIC Halloween is coming, soon.  You will have Top Dollar if you watch for me at the Showtime, tomorrow night. 
ALBRECHT I should be trying to stop you. 
Eric nods, keeping his eyes on the cigarette. 
ERIC Thank you.  For giving a damn. 
ALBRECHT My pleasure. ERIC Don't smoke these. 
As a bus grumbles past on the street, Eric pitches the butt and simultaneously ducks out of frame. 
ANGLE - ALBRECHT TURNS 
to see a blank building wall.  Fire escape.  Darkness.  No Eric. He does a full 360 degree turn.  Eric is gone again. 
ALBRECHT Damn, I wish he wouldn't do that. 
MOVING ANGLE - FROM BUS ROOF 
Coat flapping, Eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves away from Albrecht's position. 
INT. LAO NIGHTCLUB OFFICE - NIGHT 
Lao has the partially disassembled rat skeleton in front of him, as well as a mortar and pestle with some bits of crushed bone, and is smoking powdered rat bone in a pipe and Grange reports to him. 
GRANGE The son of a bitch winked at me. The he jumped.  Three stories. 
Lao seems strangely unaffected by the bizarre nature of Grange's tale. 
LAO Did you see an animal of any kind? Did you see a bird? 
GRANGE (puzzled) No.  I saw a guitar. (beat; irritated) This isn't some rock-n-roller you forgot to pay, is it? (beat) There was a drawing on the wall that looked like a bird.  In blood. 
Lao's expression is one of sublime content. 
LAO Good. 
Grange It could've been a chicken... 
EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT - ("CROWVISION") 
A LONG SHOT of the T-Bird parked across the street from the store as two figures -- T-Bird and Skank -- approach on the store side. 
SPEEG I hate this cream stuff.  They can't even call it cream, legally. 
They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety. 
MJ What in the crap? 
MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff. 
SPEEG Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit! 
EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT 
as the cruiser roars out to give chase. 
INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT 
Eric lends the chase car a backward look. 
ERIC You caught one.  Drive faster. 
T-BIRD Man, you gonna get us killed dead and I don't even know what you want! 
Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face. 
ERIC I want you to stop talking.  And drive.  Drive faster. 
Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's tape.  What Eric needs. 
ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR 
as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 
ERIC (CONT'D) You're very popular.  Thought you could handle this thing. 
T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win. 
T-BIRD To hell with you. 
ERIC (wry) Naturally. 
INSERT - SPEEDOMETER 
Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT 
A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the city. 
EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT 
All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning. It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit. 
INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT 
as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl. 
EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT 
as MJ's unit broadsides the first cop car. 
EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT 
The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt. 
INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT 
T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic. 
T-BIRD So what -- you gonna rape me now? 
ERIC Time for your reward, T.  Payback with interest earned. 
Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll. 
EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT 
A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk. 
ERIC'S POV - The Trunk. 
loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia. 
INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT 
SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the pedal.  Mummified into his seat.  Hands taped to the wheel. Throat taped hard against the headrest. 
The car is now in gear, idling. 
ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW 
MICKEY (to Elly) Everyone's a comedian.  Enjoy. 
Mickey EXITS FRAME. 
GRANGE (O.S.) You're Elly, right?  I know your mom. 
Elly turns.  Grange sits next to her.  Lao's mirrored-windowed car is parked across the street, b.g. 
ELLY A lot of people "know" my mom. 
Grange points o.s., indicating he wants coffee from Mickey. 
GRANGE I know your friend, too -- the one that looks like a rock star. 
ELLY I don't know you. 
GRANGE (easily) I'd like to get in touch with him. 
Elly sizes Grange up. 
ELLY You're not a cop, either.  What do you want him for? 
GRANGE I'm looking for a good guitar man. 
ELLY Right. 
Grange withdraws a $10 bill from his wallet and slides it across the countertop to Mickey. 
ELLY (CONT'D) You buying? (cuts him some slack) He kinda wanders around.  You'll see him if you pay attention. 
GRANGE I need to find him kind of soon, Elly. 
INT. LOFT - ON ERIC - DAY 
No shirt, the ring on the thong around his neck -- workout mode. 
He twirls and performs odd Crow moves of increasing complexity in the big open living room.  On purpose, he stretches hard against the bedroom doorframe. 
FLASH:  Shelly stands in the blue moonlight near the picture window wearing a rococo Victorian gown.  PUSH IN TIGHT as she is embraced by a nude Eric.  He undoes the last few remaining ties that hold the gown in place.  FOLLOW THE GOWN as it crumples down the length of Shelly's (also otherwise nude) body to the floor... 
FLASH ENDS. 
LOW ANGEL - FROM INSIDE THE BEDROOM - ON ERIC 
hanging there, inviting the pain the FLASHES bring.  Breathing as though he is pumping iron, pumping up. 
ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN BEDROOM 
embracing a ragged full-length dress that used to be Shelly's. 
FLASH: Eric and Shelly (wearing the same dress), exchange an extremely passionate and intimate KISS in the moonlight. 
FLASH ENDS. 
ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC 
as he drops the dress.  Absorbing the pain and memories. 
ANGLE - LATER - ERIC IN LIVING ROOM 
executing a complex roll that winds him up at the windowsill. He grasps it with both hands. 
FLASH:  A series of CLOSE SHOTS of Eric and Shelly's HANDS, each moving along the other's body.  Curves and dips and contours. But Eric's gaze never leaves SHelly's eyes. 
FLASH ENDS. 
ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AT WINDOW 
His GAZE similarly FIXED.  Bringing his hands away and clapping them together, deep breath, fingertips pressed to his face, like Kung Fu prep.  When he opens his eyes, the crow is there before him on the sill. 
ERIC That's better. 
He wipes his torso down with a towel. 
ERIC (CONT'D) It's almost time. 
He holds his hand in front of his face and he flexes it.  We can HEAR tendons CRACKLE like a harness.  Closes it into a powerful fist. 
INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - NIGHT 
TIGHT on Skank as he slams his fist down on the table.  He has a black eye and facial scuffs from his liquor store encounter. 
SKANK Top, I made the sumbitch!  Face all painted white like some kinda fuckin' kabuki homo! 
WIDE ANGLE to include all present:  Lao, Grange, Lao Guards #1 and #2, Top Dollar, and a Sentry.  Top dusts up a line and rinses his nostrils with brandy. 
LAO Sounds like our "Crow" is out-maneuvering you. 
TOP DOLLAR "Our" Crow...? 
ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR 
springing up from behind table.  But Eric is gone from the field of fire and one shot strikes Skank, rising at the far end. 
ANGLE - LAO AND GRANGE 
making for the door, Grange as shield.  Lao draws a pistol.  The door opens and Lao shoots a Sentry to clear him out of the way. 
ANGLE - TIGHTER ON LAO 
A last look back toward Eric and Grange hustle Lao out. 
Door SLAM o.s.  Top is out of ammo as Eric lands from above frame right in front of him and slaps the gun from his hand. 
TOP DOLLAR (awed but maintained) You want my attention, man you got it. 
ANGLE - SKANK UNDER TABLE 
Wounded but clawing toward Eric just the same. 
SKANK It's him, Top!  He dusted T-Bird! 
ANGLE - ERIC AND TOP DOLLAR, FACE-TO-FACE 
ERIC You have to be SKank. (to Top Dollar) One moment. 
As he speaks, WIDEN FRAME as he turns and grabs the incoming Skank by the hair. 
ERIC Thank of a snappy comeback for me on your way down. 
Without a beat he pitches Skank right out the window!  Skank howls all the way down. 
EXT. STREET - ON POLICE CAR - NIGHT 
Damaged from the wreck, limping home, piloted by our pals Speeg and MJ.  Skank smashes down into the roof, imploding the flashbar and windshield.  MJ drenches his lap in fresh coffee. 
MJ OwwwAAHHH son of a BITCH! 
ANGLE - SIDEWALK ACROSS THE STREET - ON ALBRECHT 
who watches with slow marvel from the shadows ALBRECHT Jesus Christ... 
He runs to assist the demolished cruiser. 
INT. TOP DOLLAR'S LAIR - RESUMING - NIGHT 
Just Top, Eric, corpses, and lazily drifting gunsmoke. 
ERIC Top Dollar, you're the only one here still wasting good air... 
TOP DOLLAR Five large, in the drawer right over there.  I never saw you. 
ERIC Do you know what you destroyed? 
TOP DOLLAR Take the dope, too. 
Eric backhands Top into the wall.  Gets in his face, seething. 
ERIC A year ago.  A very nice lady circulated a petition.  She died. Last Halloween.  Answer yes or no. 
TOP DOLLAR That's ancient history. 
ERIC It's yesterday!  Do you know what you destroyed? 
Top Dollar yells right back at Eric's anger. 
TOP DOLLAR Who gives a fuck!  I'm a businessman.  You gonna do me, then do me and shut you're face! 
ERIC You don't even remember... 
TOP DOLLAR I never forget anything, dickhead. That building was a sweep-and- clear; the bitch was a nuisance with her goddamned petition.  It got a little rowdy... end of story. 
ERIC Rowdy.  Let me fill in some gaps for you. 
And he grabs Top's head the way he grabbed ALbrecht's earlier, slams Top into the wall.  Nose-to-nose. 
FLASH:  Shelly backing away from oncoming Funboy in the loft, trying to retreat, nowhere to run, her home invaded, scared. 
FLASH ENDS. 
ANGLE - TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC 
Top is quivering, almost helpless in Eric's hypnotic grasp. Eric winces, hard, and -- 
FLASH:  Shelly cut, bleeding, struggling against T-Bird.  Wild. 
FLASH ENDS. 
ANGLE - RESUMING TOP DOLLAR AND ERIC 
MOVING ANGLE - THE STREET BELOW 
COPS below, COPS in the chopper, everyone rushing parallel to Eric, trying to keep up. 
ERIC'S POV - THE STREET, THE HELICOPTER 
PAN QUICK to the next ledge.  COPS right behind him on the roof as well. 
WITH ERIC - AS HE RUNS TO THE EDGE. 
and finds a void waiting there.  No connecting building. 
ANOTHER MOVING ANGLE - ERIC 
staying ahead of the search light.  A fantastic series of artful moves that wind him up at the rear edge of the roof. 
ANGLE - SWAT MEN ON NEXT ROOF 
sighting Eric as the light picks him out.  Eric glances at them... then jumps. 
CHOPPER PILOT (O.S./FILTERED) He's off the roof.  We can't see him. 
CLOSE-UP - LEAD SWAT 
pulling his weapon off target, because there is not target. 
LEAD SWAT Dammit to hell! (beat; to men) Come on. 
ANGLE - ALLEY - STREET LEVEL 
Eric lands like a falling safe, scattering garbage.  But he's okay, up and running. 
ANGLE - ERIC'S RUNNING POV - END OF ALLEY 
as his escape is cut off by a police car that screeches to a stop, blocking the exit. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - ERIC 
as he backpedals, scanning for an alternate escape. 
ALBRECHT (from car) Come on! 
CLOSER ANGLE  - POLICE CAR 
We can see Albrecht.  Eric dives inside and the car burns rubber. 
INT. ALBRECHT'S CAR - TRAVELLING - NIGHT 
Albrecht harried and frantic, but in control. 
ALBRECHT Keep your head down! 
He twists and turns the car, glancing rearward for pursuit. 
Gradually he calms down. 
ALBRECHT (CONT'D) I figured you might need a ride home. 
Eric looks up at him from his half-concealed crouch. 
ERIC It's done. ALBRECHT I figured as much.  Did you cap off Funboy. 
ERIC Funboy had to leave this mortal coil. 
ALBRECHT Yeah, among others. (sees Eric's condition) Hey, man -- you're hit. 
ERIC It's only a flesh wound. 
ALBRECHT It's only fourteen or fifteen flesh wounds. 
Eric sits up as the car gains distance.  Grabs the cigarette out of ALbrecht's mouth.  Takes his single puff. 
ERIC You shouldn't smoke these. 
He pitches the smoke out the open car window. 
ALBRECHT Great.  Litterbug of the Living Dead. 
Eric turns back to Albrecht. 
ERIC I'm finished. 
Eric shoots him a doubtful look. 
ERIC (CONT'D) I mean, I've done what I came to do.  It shouldn't hurt this much. But it will pass... 
ALBRECHT (not buying it) Right. (beat) You sure I can't just take you to the emergency ward? 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT - ON ALBRECHT'S CAR 
INT. LOFT - STAIRWELL - DAY 
Moving with Elly as she nears the open loft door.  She PEEKS cautiously inside. 
RESUME ERIC 
Without looking toward the door, he speaks. 
ELLY What's going on...? 
ERIC A remembrance. (beat) A closure. 
And Eric consigns to the fire the DRESS we saw earlier. 
Holds a photograph in a broken frame.  Cracked glass.  Subject: Eric and Shelly, goofing for the camera. 
He chucks it into the fire.  Draws a deep breath. 
ERIC Better now.  I feel good.  How are you, Elly, my friend? 
Elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see Eric.  Eric is staring at her, intently. 
ERIC What is it? ELLY I knew.  I knew I knew you.  Even with the makeup and stuff you wore. (beat) You really loved her, didn't you? 
CLOSE-UP - FIREPLACE 
The photo burns and blackens in the grate. 
ERIC You brought flowers.  As long as you don't forget her, Elly, she lives. 
ELLY (upset) She's dead.  She's gone.  And now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too.  I hate this place; it isn't fair. 
ERIC Elly... 
He draws her close.  Wipes away an errant tear with his thumb. 
ERIC (CONT'D) Sometimes the people we care about are gone, for no reason.  Sometimes that's really tough.  I cry.  But if the people we love are gone, we keep them -- 
He taps Elly's temple, then his won. 
ERIC (CONT'D) -- right here.  It's a big responsibility.  And that makes it okay to mourn. (beat) I know that if you weren't here, I'd be very sad. 
Elly gives Eric a hug. 
ELLY You look funny without your white face on.  Like it's your day off or something. 
He quizzical expression amuses him. 
ERIC Somebody here wants to meet you. Gabriel? 
Gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them. Elly is immediately smitten.  Happy. ELLY I remember him!  Here, Gabriel... here kitty... Gabriel... Is he still yours? 
ERIC I think he's yours, now. 
The cat seems to like that idea.  Elly wraps him hugely up in her arms, talking to him: "How're you, Gabriel, whatcha doin'" 
ANOTHER ANGLE - TIGHTER ON ERIC 
While Elly is preoccupied with the cat, Eric gives up his last bit of Shelly to the fire - a portrait photo of her, small and creased.  He puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat, then turns to Elly. 
ERIC (CONT'D) I have something else for you. 
BACK FOCUS as Eric lifts off his neck Shelly's ring for Elly's inspection.  The ring twirls large in f.g. 
ELLY Nobody ever gave me something like that before.  Ever. 
Eric places it around her neck.  Elly BEAMS. 
ERIC Shelly would've wanted you to have it.  This way, you'll think of her every time you see it... 
ELLY And she'll be alive.  Up here. 
Elly TAPS her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the ring. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Blowing wind.  TRICK-OR-TREATERS wisp past.  Ghosts, witches, demons out for Halloween.

walking home with Gabriel zipped up inside her coat is Elly.  A fire engine wails past in the opposite direction.

Strictly downscale building.  Elly to Gabriel"

Pulling on black night-fighting clothes, skintight. 
ANGLE - THE VANITY 
as Eric (seen in mirror) jabs his fingers into the white makeup and smears it on. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. STREET NEAR CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Eric marches along in plain view since everyone around him seems to be in costume.  The wind whips his coat.  KIDS bustle around him with trick-or-treat bags.  The crow perched on his shoulder. 
ERIC'S POV - CITY SKYLINE 
Somewhere, a few blocks over, a building is burning. 
ANGLE - ERIC WALKING 
A fire engine races past on the street.  He steps out in its wake and crosses over to -- 
MEDIUM MOVING SHOT - THE CEMETERY 
waiting for him as he crosses to the fence.  Beyond the fence, in the distance, the church looms. 
ANGLE - ERIC 
He pauses.  A KID in a Creature from the Black Lagoon mask comes, passes Eric, then comes back for a touch. 
CREATURE KID Trick or treat! 
Eric smiles.  Not tonight. 
EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Eric is standing over the grave of Shelly Webster, looking down. He holds for a moment then moves on. 
EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
Eric ascends toward giant oak doors, tres Gothique.  The crow flaps past, leading him. 
NEW ANGLE - TOP OF STEPS -- where waits the Skull Cowboy.  As Eric approaches, the Skull Cowboy interposes himself between Eric and the huge double doors. 
Eric glares up, defiant.  Moves up the steps.  The Skull Cowboy extends a skeletal hand.  STOP. 
SKULL COWBOY Stop screwing around. 
TIGHT ON ERIC 
Angry, ready to battle:  You talking to me? 
SKULL COWBOY (CONT'D) Your job is done.  You interfere with the living again. 
ERIC Tell me I'll get hurt.  That I might die. (beat) I've already done that.  I don't need anyone's help.  Yours included. 
STAIR ANGLE - ERIC AND SKULL COWBOY 
Eric lower, Skull Cowboy superior, the storm wild around them. 
SKULL COWBOY Do this thing and you will be vulnerable.  The blood will not return. (beat) No powers.  No reunion.  Nothing. 
ERIC Fine with me. 
He ADVANCES a step up; the Skull Cowboy Hold fast. 
SKULL COWBOY You'll be alone. 
ERIC I'm already alone. 
INT. BELL TOWER - NIGHT 
Through a castle keep-like slit, Grange monitors Eric's arrival.  He speaks into a headset. 
GRANGE We've got company. 
LAO (O.S./FILTERED) Is he inside? 
GRANGE'S POV - ERIC 
Eric Talking to dead air.  Almost arguing with it.  Eerie. 
RESUME GRANGE 
As he talks into his mike he hefts a nightscoped, laser-sighted sniper's rifle. 
GRANGE He's just out front talking to himself.  You tell me. 
LAO (O.S./FILTERED) You intended to finish this evening in the cemetery.  I am here to help you on your way. 
ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE IN GALLERY 
Swapping his tranquilizer gun for a more lethal rifle, similarly scoped.  He sights the fallen Eric in a spray of green light. 
HIGH ANGLE - HAND HELD - ERIC AT ALTER 
Groping for support to drag himself back to standing. 
GRANGE (O.S.) I've got him if you want him. 
LAO (O.S./FILTERED) No shooting. 
GRANGE (into headset) Move in, guys. 
HIGH ANGLE - THE SANCTUARY -- as Lao Guards #3 and #4 move into light, closing on Eric's position in the center of isle. Both wield calico's and one bears a sword. 
CLOSE ANGLE - ALTER -- Lao makes his entrance from shadow wearing a brisk pugilist get-up, a practical fighting outfit. Makes a show of drawing the killing blade. 
LAO I wish to possess what you have now. 
ERIC I want the girl.  Unharmed.  Now. 
LAO I know.  That is why I will prevail.  Mr. Grange... ? 
Eric CRAMPS UP, CLUTCHING his throat in obvious pain. 
ANGLE - GRANGE AT STAINED GLASS WINDOW 
Holding the crow by the neck, TIGHTLY.  He plucks the tranq dart from the its body. 
ANGLE - RESUMING ERIC AS LAO MOVES IN CLOSER 
Crashing to one knee, invisibly bludgeoned, struggling to breathe.  Lao has no fear, walking around the stricken Eric. 
LAO Sooner or later, my action were destined to bring me a genuine Fury.  And it turned out to be you. At last.  I appreciate your abilities as few mortals can. That's why I desire them. 
ERIC You're too late.  There was a guy outside - on the stairs - you really need to talk to.  But he turned to dust and blew away. (beat, gasping) I don't have any power for you to take. 
LAO I don't believe that. Lao motions to Grange with the killing blade.  Grange RELAXES his deathgrip on the crow.  MOVE IN CLOSE on Eric so we may perceive a palpable degree of relief. 
LAO (CONT'D) Time for you to die for me. (beat) Funny, how the dead can still bleed.  How they need air. 
Eric IMMOBILIZED as Lao DRAWS BACK the Blade.  To Grange: 
LAO (CONT'D) Break its neck. 
ANGLE - RESUMING GRANGE AT WINDOW as he prepares to do dirty on the bird. 
Over his shoulder, we PUSH in to the BULLETHOLE from the first dart until we're in TIGHT CLOSE-UP of an eye watching through the hole. 
EXT. CHURCH - OBVERSE OF WINDOW - NIGHT 
Albrecht digs through a sling bag of weaponry, trying to simultaneously monitor the peephole, muttering sotto to himself. 
ALBRECHT Had to go get yourself hip-deep in shit, didn't you, my friend. 
It begins to rain.  Albrecht glances resentfully toward the sky. 
ALBRECHT (CONT'D) Give it a rest, huh? 
A hefts a machinegun, clipped over and under.  CUTS LOOSE on full auto into the Madonna on the window. 
INT.  CHURCH NAVE - NIGHT 
As the window EXPLODES toward Grange and he sucks big hits from behind, DROPPING the crow.  The bird hits the ground, flapping weakly. 
LAO GUARDS #3 & #4 exchange a look and whip up their Calicos, RETURNING FIRE. 
EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT 
Albrecht takes cover as a lot of religious stuff is noisily destroyed all around his position.  Chunks of the window continue to disintegrate. 
INT. CHURCH ALTER (NIGHT) 
Eric tuck-and-rolls out of the way as we go CLOSE on Lao, screaming. 
LAO I said no shooting! 
Then he's ducking bullets himself as Albrecht STEPS IN through the blown out window, the machine gun stuttering on slugs. 
The sanctuary comes apart around Lao.  He RETREATS to the alter and EXITS whence he came. 
TIGHT ON PEW -- ERIC DIVES just as Guard #4 comes after him with the sword, which chomps into the wood and gets stuck there. Guard #4 releases it and cross draws his Calico as ERIC springs back into the frame -- STRAIGHT UP. 
TIGHT ON GUARD #4 as Eric's lancing foot propels him backward before he can fire. 
INTERCUTS -- ALBRECHT AND GUARD #3 scrambling to reload.  Guard changes magazine; Albrecht swaps clips.

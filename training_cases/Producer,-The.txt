MAX BIALYSTOCK - THEATRICAL PRODUCER 
LITTLE OLD LADY BEGINS TO DESCEND STAIRWAY.  SHE STOPS, TURNS, BLOWS ANOTHER KISS AND ONCE MORE WAVES GOODBYE. BIALYSTOCK GRACIOUSLY ANSWERS IN KIND. 
BIALYSTOCK Don't forget the checkee.  Can't produce playees without checkees. 
LITTLE OLD LADY You can count on me-o, you dirty young man. 
CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK'S FACE FROZEN IN A LITTLE GOODBYE SMILE.  THE LITTLE OLD LADY'S FOOTSTEPS.  BEGIN TO FADE. BIALYSTOCK'S FACE QUICKLY RESUMES ITS NORMAL EXPRESSION -- DESPAIR AND DISGUST.  HE THEN REACHES INTO HIS VEST POCKET, PULLS OUT AN OLD-FASHIONED, POCKET WATCH AND EARNESTLY CONSULTS ITS FACE. 
CAMERA STAYS WITH HIM AS HE RUSHES INTO HIS OFFICE. BIALYSTOCK MOVES WITH A QUICK SHUFFLING GAIT TO HIS DESK. FROM THE TOP OF IT HE PICKS UP A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH.

CAMERA SHOWS CABINET INTERIOR FILLED WITH HUNDREDS OF SIMILARLY FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS OF LITTLE OLD LADIES. 
CAMERA BACK TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE PLACES PHOTOGRAPH IN ITS PROPER NICHE AND BEGINS TO LOOK THROUGH THE FACES. 
CAMERA SLOWLY PANS ROWS OF PHOTOGRAPHS, BIALYSTOCK'S P.O.V. 
BIALYSTOCK (Voice Over) "Hold me, touch me', 'hold me, touch me', 'hold me, touch me', where is 'hold me, touch me'?  Ahhh ... here we are.  'Hold me, touch me.'" 
CAMERA STOPS PANNING AND REMAINS ON ONE OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS. BIALYSTOCK'S HAND MOVES INTO THE FRAME AND PICKS UP PHOTOGRAPH.

DISSOLVE TO FOURTH FLOOR LANDING.  THE LITTLE OLD LADY MAKES HER WAY TO THE TOP.  SHE HANGS ONTO THE BANISTER FOR SUPPORT AS SHE CATCHES HER BREATH.  SHE RAISES HER VEIL, REACHES INTO HER PURSE, TAKES OUT A SMALL FLACON OF PERFUME AND SPRAYS DELICATELY BEHIND BOTH EARS.  THOROUGHLY COMPOSED, SHE APPROACHES BIALYSTOCK'S DOOR.  SHE RAPS ON THE DOOR THREE TIMES IN QUICK SUCCESSION, WAITS A MOMENT, RAPS TWICE AND THEN THREE TIMES AGAIN.  SUDDENLY THE DOOR IS FLUNG OPEN. 
LITTLE OLD LADY LEAPS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND POSES, COYLY. 
LITTLE OLD LADY To the victor go the spoils. 
BIALYSTOCK STARTS FOR HER.  SHE RUSHES AROUND A CHAIR AND DUCKS BEHIND IT.  BIALYSTOCK TIPTOES ON TO CHAIR AND PEEKS OVER IT.

CUT TO LITTLE OLD LADY.  SHE IS LYING PHONE ON THE DESK, PREENING HERSELF AND PURRING.

STOP ACTION. 
CREDIT. 
RESUME ACTION. 
BIALYSTOCK FALLS INTO THE CHAIR MOANING.  SHE HOPS ON TO HIS LAP.  FROM HIS BREAST POCKET SHE TAKES A HANDKERCHIEF AND TENDERLY DABS HIS CHEEK WITH IT. 
LITTLE OLD LADY Oh, Bialy, Bialy, darling, did I hurt you? 
FREEZE-ACTION. 
MEDIUM SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY IN FRONT OF BIALYSTOCK'S DOOR. 
BIALYSTOCK Until Thursday, then, you bawdy wench. 
HE SLAPS HER ON THE RUMP. 
LITTLE OLD LADY Oooh.  I love it.  Hold me, touch me. 
CUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS, AGHAST. 
BACK TO MEDIUM SHOT LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK. 
BIALYSTOCK Thursday.  I'll see you Thursday. 
LITTLE OLD LADY And we'll finish playing the Contessa and Rudolfo. 
BIALYSTOCK Good.  Yes.  Thursday. 
LITTLE OLD LADY And after that we'll play the Abduction and cruel rape of Lucretia ... And I'll play Lucretia. 
CUT TO BLOOM IN SHADOWS.  IT IS ALL TOO MUCH FOR HIM.  HE LOOKS THE OTHER WAY.  SUDDENLY HIS EYES WIDEN IN SURPRISE, AS HE DISCOVERS ANOTHER MAN HIDING IN THE NEXT DOORWAY.  THE MAN PUTS A FINGER TO HIS LIPS INDICATING SILENCE.  THERE IS NO PLACE LEFT FOR BLOOM TO LOOK.  HE LOOKS TO HEAVEN. 
BACK TO LITTLE OLD LADY AND BIALYSTOCK. 
LITTLE OLD LADY Oh, Thursday.  Will Thursday ever come? 
BIALYSTOCK (to himself) Like clockwork. 
SHE STARTS TO DESCEND. 
LITTLE OLD LADY I shall count the minutes. 
BIALYSTOCK Goodbye, my angel ... My angel! (calling after her) Hey, touch me ... wait!  Hey, uh ... Lucretia, Lucretia! 
WE HEAR A MOUNTING CLATTER OF FOOTSTEPS AS THE LITTLE OLD LADY FLIES BACK UP THE STAIRS. 
LITTLE OLD LADY (eagerly) Yes??? 
BIALYSTOCK Oh, Angelcake, you forgot to give me the check.  Can't produce a play without money, ha, ha, ha. 
CUT TO BLOOM.  ONCE MORE HE STEALS A GLANCE AT THE STRANGER HIDDEN IN THE SECOND DOORWAY.  ONCE AGAIN THE MAN GESTURES FOR HIM TO BE SILENT. 
CUT BACK TO BIALYSTOCK AND THE OLD LADY. 
LITTLE OLD LADY (opening her handbag and reaching inside) Of course, the check, I had it with me all the time. 
SHE TAKES OUT THE CHECK AND HANDS IT TO HIM. 
LITTLE OLD LADY I don't know what's happening to me. I must be getting old. 
BIALYSTOCK TAKES CHECK AND READS IT. 
LITTLE OLD LADY Is it all right?  I made it out to cash.  You didn't tell me the name of the play. 
BIALYSTOCK Oh, it's fine.  Fine.  Good.  Good. Bye.  Bye. 
LITTLE OLD LADY Til Thursday, my Darling, I shall count the minutes. 
SHE STARTS TO DESCEND. 
LITTLE OLD LADY (descending) Ta.  Ta. 
BIALYSTOCK How dare you condemn me without knowing all the facts. 
BLOOM But sir, I'm not condem ... 
BIALYSTOCK Shut up.  I'm having a rhetorical conversation. (to himself) How humiliating.  Max Bialystock. Max Bialystock. 
BIALYSTOCK SUDDENLY WHEELS AND SHOUTS AT BLOOM. 
BIALYSTOCK You know who I used to be?  Max Bialystock!  The King of Broadway! Six shows running at once.  Lunch at Delmonico's.  Two hundred dollar suits.  Look at me.  Look at me now! I'm wearing a cardboard belt! 
HE RIPS THE BELT OFF AND HOLDS IT IN THE AIR. 
BIALYSTOCK I used to have thousands of investors begging, pleading, to put their money into a Max Bialystock production. 
HE PICKS UP THE PICTURE ON DESK ('HOLD ME, TOUCH ME') TAKES IT OVER TO OPEN CABINET FILLED WITH SIMILAR PICTURES. 
BIALYSTOCK Look at my investors now.  Voila! (gestures at pictures) Hundreds of little old ladies stopping off at Max Bialystock's office to grab a last thrill on the way to the cemetery. 
HE PUTS PICTURE BACK IN ITS PLACE.  LOOKS TOWARD BLOOM. 
CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS OBVIOUSLY TOUCHED BY THE GREAT MAN'S DILEMMA. 
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. 
BIALYSTOCK You have exactly ten seconds to change that disgusting look of pity into one of enormous respect.  One ... Two ... 
CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS REALLY TRYING TO CHANGE HIS EXPRESSION. 
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK. 
BIALYSTOCK Do the books!  Do the books! 
CUT TO BLOOM.  HE IS GREATLY RELIEVED. 
BLOOM (sighing) Yes, sir.  Thank you. 
HE PLUNGES INTO HIS WORK. 
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE GOES TO WINDOW, LOOKS OUT. 
BIALYSTOCK (to himself) Window's so filthy, can't tell if it's day or night out there. 
HE WIPES WINDOW WITH HIS CUFF.  LOOKS AT WINDOW.  NO GOOD. LOOKS AT HIS GRIMY CUFF.  GRIMACES.  FROM HIS DESK HE TAKES THE REMAINS OF A CARDBOARD CONTAINER OF COFFEE AND SLOSHES IT AGAINST THE WINDOW.  HE WIPES WITH HIS TIE.  HE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER AT BLOOM TO SEE IF HE IS WATCHING.  BLOOM IS WATCHING.  THEIR EYES MEET.  BLOOM'S EYES RETREAT. BIALYSTOCK VICTORIOUSLY TURNS AWAY AND LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW DOWN INTO THE STREET. 
CAMERA:  SHOT OF STREET.  BIALYSTOCK'S POINT OF VIEW.  A WHITE ROLLS ROYCE SLOWLY MAKES ITS WAY UP THE BLOCK. 
BIALYSTOCK (voice over as camera follows Rolls) Look at that.  A white Rolls Royce. That's it baby, when you got it, flaunt it. 
BLOOM (off screen) Koff, koff ... ahem, ahem ... harrumph ... 
BIALYSTOCK I assume you are making those cartoon noises to attract my attention.  Am I correct in my assumption, you fish-faced enemy of the people? 
BLOOM IS WOUNDED. 
BIALYSTOCK I have hurt your feelings. 
BLOOM NODS. 
BIALYSTOCK Good, what is it? 
BLOOM Sir, may I speak to you for a minute? 
DURING BIALYSTOCK'S LAST SPEECH, BLOOM UNCONSCIOUSLY REACHES INTO HIS POCKET, TAKES OUT THE BLUE BLANKET AND RUBS IT ACROSS HIS CHEEK. 
BLOOM Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear, oh dear. 
BIALYSTOCK (faintly) Help! 
BLOOM All right.  I'll do it.  I'll do it. 
BIALYSTOCK Thank you, Bloom.  I knew I could con you. 
BLOOM Oh, it's all right ... wha? 
BIALYSTOCK Nothing.  Nothing.  Do it.  Do it. 
BLOOM (pouring over the accounts) Now let's see, two thousand dollars. That isn't much.  I'm sure I can hide it somewhere.  After all, the department of internal revenue isn't interested in a show that flopped. 
BIALYSTOCK Yes.  Right.  Good thinking.  You figure it out.  I'm tired.  I'm gonna take a little nap. (crossing to couch) Wake me if there's a fire. 
HE HURLS HIMSELF DOWN ONTO THE COUCH. 
CAMERA MOVES IN TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM. 
BLOOM Now let's see, if we add these figures, we get ... 
CAMERA MOVES INTO CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S FINGER SWIFTLY MOVING DOWN LONG COLUMN OF FIGURES.  HE COMES TO THE END AND IMMEDIATELY WRITHES TOTAL BELOW. 
BACK TO TIGHT SHOT OF BLOOM.  HE COMPARES PAGES. 
BLOOM (musing to himself) Heh, heh, heh, amazing.  It's absolutely amazing.  But under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit. 
QUICK CUT TO BIALYSTOCK'S SLEEPING FACE.  HIS EYES POP OPEN. 
CUT BACK TO BLOOM. 
BLOOM Yes.  Yes.  It's quite possible. If he were certain the show would fail, a man could make a fortune. 
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  BY NOW HE IS HALFWAY ACROSS THE ROOM. HIS WHOLE BEING TINGLING WITH ALERTNESS.  HE MOVES TO BLOOM'S DESK AND HOVERS OVER HIM, WAITING EXPECTANTLY FOR MORE INFORMATION.  BUT BLOOM IS LOST IN HIS WORK, UNAWARE THAT BIALYSTOCK IS HANGING ON HIS EVERY WORD. 
BIALYSTOCK Yes??? 
BLOOM LOOKS UP.  HE IS STARTLED TO SEE BIALYSTOCK'S FACE SO CLOSE TO HIS OWN. 
BLOOM (at a loss) Yes, what? 
BIALYSTOCK What you were saying.  Keep talking. 
BLOOM What was I saying? 
BIALYSTOCK You were saying that under the right circumstances, a producer could make more money with a flop than he could with a hit. 
BLOOM (smiling) Yes, it's quite possible. 
BIALYSTOCK You keep saying that, but you don't tell me how.  How could a producer make more money with a flop than with a hit? 
BLOOM, SLIGHTLY EXASPERATED, PUTS HIS PENCIL DOWN AND FACES BIALYSTOCK.  HE SPEAKS TO BIALYSTOCK AS A TEACHER WOULD A STUDENT. 
BLOOM It's simply a matter of creative accounting.  Let us assume, just for the moment, that you are a dishonest man. 
BIALYSTOCK Assume away! 
BLOOM Well, it's very easy.  You simply raise more money than you really need. 
BLOOM (his eyes widened in terror) You're going to jump on me. 
BIALYSTOCK STARES AT HIM INCREDULOUSLY. 
BLOOM You're going to jump on me.  I know you're going to jump on me -- like Nero jumped on Poppea. 
BIALYSTOCK (nonplussed) What??? 
BLOOM (by now he is shrieking) Poppea.  She was his wife.  And she was unfaithful to him.  So he got mad and he jumped on her.  Up and down, up and down, until he squashed her like a bug.  Please don't jump on me. 
BIALYSTOCK (shouting and jumping up and down next to Bloom) I'm not going to jump on you! 
BLOOM (rolling away in terror) Aaaaaaaaaa! 
BIALYSTOCK (hoisting Bloom to his feet) Will you get a hold on yourself. 
BLOOM (up on his feet and running for cover) Don't touch me!  Don't touch me! 
HE RUNS TO A CORNER OF THE ROOM.  TRAPPED!  HE TURNS. 
BIALYSTOCK What are you afraid of?  I'm not going to hurt you!  What's the matter with you? 
BLOOM I'm hysterical.  I'm having hysterics.  I'm hysterical.  I can't stop.  When I get like this, I can't stop.  I'm hysterical. 
BIALYSTOCK RUSHES TO THE DESK.  PICKS UP A CARAFE OF WATER AND SHOSHES ITS CONTENTS INTO BLOOM'S FACE. 
BLOOM I'm wet!  I'm wet!  I'm hysterical and I'm wet! 
BIALYSTOCK IN A DESPERATE MOVE TO STOP BLOOM'S HYSTERICS, SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE. 
BLOOM (holding his face) I'm in pain!  And I'm wet!  And I'm still hysterical! 
BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS HAND AGAIN. 
BLOOM No!  No!  Don't hit.  It doesn't help.  It only increases my sense of danger. 
BIALYSTOCK What can I do?  What can I do? You're getting me hysterical. 
BLOOM Go away from me.  You frighten me. (he indicates the sofa) Sit over there. 
BIALYSTOCK SITS ON THE SOFA. 
BIALYSTOCK (exasperated) Okay.  I'm way over here.  Is that better? 
BLOOM It's a little better, but you still look angry. 
BIALYSTOCK How's this? (he smiles sweetly) 
BLOOM Good.  Good.  That's nice.  That's very nice.  I think I'm coming out of it now.  Yes.  Yes.  I'm definitely coming out of it.  Thank you for smiling.  It helped a great deal. 
BIALYSTOCK (for want of something sensible) Well, you know what they say, "Smile and the world smiles with you."  Heh, heh. (to himself) The man should be in a straight jacket. (to Bloom) Feeling better? 
BLOOM Much, thank you.  But I am a little lightheaded.  Maybe I should eat something.  Hysterics have a way of severely depleting one's blood sugar, you know. 
BIALYSTOCK They certainly do.  They certainly do.  Come, let me take you to lunch. 
BLOOM That's very kind of you, Mr. Bialystock, but I ... 
BIALYSTOCK (interrupting) Nonsense, nonsense, my dear boy.  I lowered your blood sugar, but least I could do is raise it a little. 
BLOOM LOOKS AT HIM SUSPICIOUSLY. 
BLOOM Coney Island?? 
BIALYSTOCK What's the matter, Leo?  Don't you like Coney Island? 
BLOOM I ... I love it.  I haven't been there since I was a kid.  But it's nearly two o'clock.  I really should be getting back to Whitehall and Marks. 
BIALYSTOCK Nonsense!  As far as Whitehall and Marks are concerned, you're working with Bialystock, right? 
BLOOM Right. 
BIALYSTOCK Then stick with Bialystock! 
SWISH PAN CUT TO CONEY ISLAND. 
FAR SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AMIDST THE CROWD AT A CUSTARD STAND. 
CAMERA ZOOMS IN.  TWO SHOT. 
BIALYSTOCK (to Custard Man) We'll have another round. 
CUSTARD MAN What kind now, sports? 
BIALYSTOCK What kind now, Leo? 
BLOOM (he's loosening up) I don't know.  Let's see.  We've had chocolate, vanilla, banana - let's go green. 
BIALYSTOCK (to Custard Man) Two pistachios, my good man. 
CUSTARD MAN I'm not your good man, I happen to own this establishment. (he turns to fill the order) 
BIALYSTOCK Everybody's a big shot. (turns to Bloom) Well, Leo, are you having a good time? 
BLOOM I don't know.  I think so.  I feel very strange. 
BIALYSTOCK Maybe you're happy. 
BLOOM Yes.  That's it.  Happy.  Well, whatta ya think of that.  Happy. 
QUICK DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ON THE WHIP (A CONEY ISLAND RIDE).  THEY ARE TIGHTLY SQUEEZED INTO ONE OF THE MOVING SEATS.  THEY ARE BETWEEN "WHIPS". 
BLOOM (licking his pistachio custard.  He is ecstatic) I love it.  I love it.  Get set. We're coming to another turn. 
BIALYSTOCK (working, relentlessly working on Bloom) Bloom, it can always be like this. Life can be beautiful.  Let me show you.  Stick with ... 
THEY HIT THE TURN. 
BIALYSTOCK Bialysto-o-o-o-ckk. 
QUICK DISSOLVE TO BARKER SELLING TICKETS IN FRONT OF TUNNEL OF LOVE.  MEDIUM SHOT OF EXIT.  A LITTLE BOAT COMES OUT.  IN IT ARE A MAN AND A WOMAN EMBRACING.  IT IS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER.  IN IT THERE IS A SAILOR KISSING A GIRL.  BOAT NUMBER THREE COMES OUT.  IN IT ARE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. 
CLOSE IN TO A TIGHT TWO SHOT.  BLOOM IS MESMERIZED. BIALYSTOCK SPEAKS IN A SOFT, ENCHANTING TONE. 
BIALYSTOCK Money is honey.  Money is honey. Money can put soft things next to your skin.  Silk ... satin ... women. 
CLOSE-UP OF BLOOM'S EYES.  THEY WIDEN ON THE WORD "WOMEN." 
QUICK DISSOLVE TO PARACHUTE JUMP.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE SEATED IN A LITTLE GONDOLA THAT SWINGS BENEATH A HUGE PARACHUTE.  THEY ARE BUCKLING THEMSELVES IN. 
BLOOM But if we're caught, we'll go to prison. 
BIALYSTOCK (sensing victory, he marshals his forces for the final assault) You think you're not in prison now? Living in a grey little room. Going to a grey little job.  Leading a grey little life. 
BLOOM (brightening) You found a flop! 
BIALYSTOCK A flop, ha!  That's putting it mildly.  A disaster!  A catastrophe! An outrage!  A guaranteed-to-close- in-one-night beauty! 
HE BENDS DOWN, PICKS UP THE SCRIPT AND SHAKES IT IN BLOOM'S FACE. 
BIALYSTOCK This is freedom from want forever. This is a house in the country. This is a Rolls Royce and a Bentley. This is wine, women and song and women. 
BLOOM SNATCHES THE SCRIPT FROM HIS HANDS AND READS ALOUD THE TITLE. 
CUT TO CLOSE-UP.  TITLE OF SCRIPT. 
BLOOM (voice over) "SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER, A Gay Romp with Adolph and Eva in Berchtesgarten."  Fantastic! 
BACK TO TWO SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. 
BIALYSTOCK It's practically a love letter to Hitler! 
BLOOM (ecstatic) It won't run a week! 
BIALYSTOCK Run a week?  Are you kidding?  This play has got to close in the first act. 
BLOOM Who wrote it? 
CUT TO AUTHOR'S NAME ON THE MANUSCRIPT:  By FRANZ LIEBKIND. 
DISSOLVE THROUGH AUTHOR'S NAME TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, SHAVED AND DAPPER, WALKING DOWN STREET IN A RUN-DOWN TENEMENT NEIGHBORHOOD. 
BLOOM Here it is -- 415. 
THEY MARCH UP STOOP TO NUMBER 415.  THEIR MOTION IS ARRESTED BY A QUERULOUS COMMAND ISSUED IN PHLEGMATIC TONES BY THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE BUILDING (A WOMAN IN HER LATE FORTIES) WHO IS LEANING OUT OF HER WINDOW WHICH IS ADJACENT TO THE STOOP. 
SUPER Who do you want? 
BLOOM (taken aback) I beg your pardon? 
SUPER Who do you want?  No one gets in the building unless I know who they want ... I'm the concierge.  My husband used to be the concierge. He's dead.  Now I'm the concierge. 
BIALYSTOCK (imperiously) We are seeking Mr. Franz Liebkind. 
SUPER Oh, the kraut.  He's on the top floor.  Apartment twenty-three. 
BLOOM Thank you. 
THEY START INTO THE BUILDING. 
SUPER But you won't find him there.  He's up on the roof with his birds.  He keeps birds.  Dirty, disgusting, filthy, lice-ridden birds.  You used to be able to sit out on the stoop like a person.  Not anymore. No sir.  Birds!  You get my drift? 
BLOOM We ... uh ... get your drift. Thank you, Madam. 
SUPER I'm not a madam.  I'm a concierge. 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER THE BUILDING. 
CUT TO FRANZ LIEBKIND.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY FORTIES.  HE IS WEARING, AS ALWAYS, A GERMAN HELMET.  HE CROUCHES BESIDE A HUGE PIGEON COOP.  IN HIS LEFT HAND HE TENDERLY HOLDS A PIGEON.  IN HIS RIGHT, A SMALL PHOTO OF ADOLPH HITLER.  HE SHOWS THE PICTURE TO THE BIRD.  HE MOVES IT BACK AND FORTH UNTIL HE IS SURE THE BIRD IS FOCUSED ON IT PROPERLY. 
LIEBKIND (to pigeon) Hilda, look ... look good ... Hilda, you're not looking.  Hilda, if he lives, I know you will find him. 
HE KISSES THE BIRD AND TOSSES IT SKYWARD. 
CUT TO ROOF DOOR.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER ONTO THE ROOF. THEY LOOK FOR LIEBKIND.  HE IS NOT ON THAT SIDE OF ROOF. THEY WALK AROUND TO OTHER SIDE.  AS SOON AS THEY TURN THE CORNER, THEY SPOT LIEBKIND CROUCHED NEAR THE COOP. 
BLOOM (whisper) Sigmund Freud. (he downs drink) 
CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK. 
BIALYSTOCK (whisper) Max Bialystock. (he downs drink) 
BACK TO SCENE. 
LIEBKIND I vas vit him a great deal, you know. 
BIALYSTOCK With whom? 
LIEBKIND (astonished by the question) Vit the Fuhrer, of course.  He liked me.  Out of all the household staff at Berchtesgarten, I vas his favorite.  I vas the only one allowed into his chambers at bedtime. 
BIALYSTOCK No kidding? 
LIEBKIND Oh, sure.  I used to take him his hot milk and his opium.  Achhh, those were the days.  Vat good times ve had.  Dinner parties vit lovely ladies and gentlemen, singing und dancing.  You know, not many people knew about it, but the Fuhrer vas a terrific dancer. 
BIALYSTOCK Really, I never dreamed ... 
LIEBKIND (flies into an indignant rage) That's because you were taken in by that verdampter Allied propaganda. Such filthy lies.  But nobody said a bad vord about Winston Churchill, did they?  Oh no, Vin Vit Vinnie! (he gestures V for victory) Churchill, vit his cigars and his brandy and his rotten paintings. Couldn't even say Nazi.  He would say Narzis, Narzis.  Ve vere not Narzies, ve vere Nazis.  But let me tell this, and you're getting it straight from the horse, Hitler vas better looking than Churchill, he vas a better dresser than Churchill, had more hair, told funnier jokes, and could dance the pants off Churchill! 
BIALYSTOCK (swinging along) That's exactly why we want to do this play.  To show the world the true Hitler, the Hitler you knew, the Hitler you loved, the Hitler with a song in his heart. (MORE) 
BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D) (to Bloom) Leo, quick, the contract. 
BLOOM QUICKLY WHIPS THE CONTRACT OUT OF HIS POCKET, PRODUCES A PEN, HANDS THEM TO BIALYSTOCK.  BIALYSTOCK SPREADS THE CONTRACT OUT ON THE TABLE BEFORE LIEBKIND. 
BIALYSTOCK Here, sign here, Franz Liebkind. And make your dream a reality. 
HE HANDS LIEBKIND THE PEN.  LIEBKIND REFUSES IT. 
LIEBKIND Wait.  No.  How do I know I can trust you?  How do I know you vill present this play in the manner and spirit in vhich it vas conceived? 
BIALYSTOCK We swear it! 
LIEBKIND Not good enough... Vould you be villing to take the Siegfried oath? 
BIALYSTOCK Yes.  We would! 
INSERT:  CLOSE-UP BLOOM.  HE LOOKS WORRIED. 
LIEBKIND Good.  I will make the preparations. 
LIEBKIND LEAVES THE ROOM. 
BLOOM (anxious whisper) Max, I don't want to take any Siegfried Oath.  I don't know what it is, but I don't want to take it. We might end up in the German Army. 
BIALYSTOCK Shut up, you idiot.  He's a harmless nut.  Play along with him.  It's almost in the bag. 
LIEBKIND ENTERS.  HE IS LADEN DOWN WITH ALL SORTS OF RITUALISTIC PARAPHERNALIA.  LIEBKIND PLACES ALL THE STUFF ON THE TABLE.  WITHOUT A WORD TO THEM, HE GOES TO PHONOGRAPH. 
IN A FEW SECONDS WE HEAR THE OPENING STRAINS OF WAGNER'S "RIDE OF THE VALKYRIES."  AS THE MUSIC BOOMS LOUDER, LIEBKIND ADDRESSES THEM. 
LIEBKIND Please to don your helmets. 
FROM THE TABLE THEY TAKE CLASSIC WAGNERIAN HELMETS (WITH HORNS) AND PLACE THEM ON THEIR HEADS. 
LIEBKIND Please to light your candles. 
THEY EACH TAKE A HUGE WHITE CANDLE FROM THE TABLE AND LIGHT IT.  LIEBKIND FLICKS THE LIGHT SWITCH.  NOW THEY ARE IN THE DARK EXCEPT FOR THE GLOW OF THEIR CANDLES. 
BLOOM Look, I'm just not wearing this arm band.  I don't care how big the deal is. 
BIALYSTOCK (placating him) Okay, take it off, take it off. 
THEY TAKE OFF THEIR ARM BANDS AND TOSS THEM INTO A LITTER BASKET.  BIALYSTOCK SPOTS A PASSING TAXI.  HE WHISTLES.  IT STOPS. 
BIALYSTOCK (to cab driver as he opens door) The Blue Gypsy. 
BLOOM (about to enter cab with Bialystock) Why are we going to the Blue Gypsy?! 
BIALYSTOCK (stopping Bloom from entering cab) We are not going to The Blue Gypsy. I am going to The Blue Gypsy. 
BIALYSTOCK GETS INTO CAB AND SLAMS THE DOOR.  HE CONTINUES SPEAKING TO BLOOM THROUGH THE WINDOW. 
BIALYSTOCK I have a rendez-vous with a lady of some means.  You see dear Bloom, phase one is complete, the play is ours.  We are now entering phase two -- the raising of the money. In the days to come, you will see very little of me, for Bialystock is launching himself into little- old-lady-land. (to cab driver) Avanti! 
THE CAB SPEEDS AWAY. 
SWISH PAN CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LITTLE OLD LADY #3.  IN HER HAND SHE HOLDS A BUBBLING GLASS OF CHAMPAGNE.  SHE RAISES IT TO BIALYSTOCK. 
PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT OF BIALYSTOCK AND LITTLE OLD LADY. THEY ARE SEATED IN A CORNER BOOTH OF A LITTLE VIENNESE CAFE. 
LITTLE OLD LADY #3 Here's to the success of your new play. 
BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS GLASS. 
BIALYSTOCK Our play, my love. 
HE GALLANTLY INTERTWINES HIS ARMS IN HERS IN A LOVER'S TOAST. IT IS HARD TO DRINK WITH ARMS ENTWINED, ESPECIALLY IF ONE OF THE ARMS IS ATTACHED TO A LITTLE OLD LADY.  THE TOAST IS A FIASCO, BIALYSTOCK GETTING MOST OF THE CHAMPAGNE OVER HIS VEST AND TROUSERS. 
LITTLE OLD LADY #3 Oh, I'm sorry, Bialy, did I wet you? 
BIALYSTOCK Think nothing of it, my dear.  A mere trifle.  A mere trifle.  Did you bring your checkbook? 
LITTLE OLD LADY #3 It's right here in my purse and I made it out just as you told me -- to cash.  That's a funny name for a play. 
BIALYSTOCK Think nothing of it. 
SHE SNAPS OPEN HER LITTLE BEADED PURSE, TAKES OUT THE CHECK AND BEGINS TO HAND IT TO BIALYSTOCK.  AT THIS MOMENT, WE ARE ASSAULTED BY THE PASSIONATE SOUND OF A CRYING VIOLIN. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A VIOLINIST IN GYPSY ATTIRE CLOSING IN ON THE TABLE.  THE LITTLE OLD LADY IS DELIGHTED BY THE VIOLINIST AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR BIALYSTOCK STOPS THE PASSAGE OF THE CHECK AS HER ATTENTION IS DIVERTED. BIALYSTOCK CAUTIOUSLY REACHES OUT TO SNATCH THE CHECK BUT EACH TIME THAT HE DOES, A TURN IN THE MUSIC MAKES THE LITTLE OLD LADY CLUTCH HER HEART.  BIALYSTOCK IS VERY UNHAPPY.  HE QUIETLY BRINGS HIS FOOT FROM BENEATH THE TABLE AND PLACES IT DIRECTLY OVER THE FOOT OF THE VIOLINIST. 
CUT TO CLOSE-UP OF BIALYSTOCK'S FOOT POISED OVER VIOLINIST'S FOOT.  BIALYSTOCK PROCEEDS TO CRUSH VIOLINIST'S FOOT. 
CUT TO VIOLINIST'S FACE.  SOMEHOW IT CONVEYS TO US ALL THE MISERY AND PAIN OF THE HUMAN CONDITION.  WITH EYES CROSSED BY GRIEF, HE LIMPS TO ANOTHER TABLE.  BIALYSTOCK QUICKLY REACHES OUT AND SNATCHES THE CHECK. 
SWISH PAN CUT TO HANSOM CAB THREADING ITS WAY THROUGH CENTRAL PARK.  NIGHT. 
CUT TO INTERIOR OF CAB.  BIALYSTOCK IS COZILY ENSCONCED WITH LITTLE OLD LADY #4. 
BIALYSTOCK (taking check from old lady) Thank you, my dear. 
LITTLE OLD LADY #4 Oh, Bialy, Bialy, tell me again. Tell me again. 
BIALYSTOCK Edna, I swear on my life, you don't look a day over sixty-five. 
SWISH PAN CUT TO CITY TRAFFIC.  DAY.  A TAXI FILLS THE SCREEN.  AS IT MOVES OUT OF FRAME, WE DISCOVER BIALYSTOCK AND LITTLE OLD LADY #5 ASTRIDE A RED AND WHITE HONDA MOTOR SCOOTER.  AS THEY ROAR PAST THE CAMERA, BIALYSTOCK SHOUTS. 
BIALYSTOCK Clear the road!  Clear the road! 
LITTLE OLD LADY #5 (clutching Bialystock fiercely) Go, Bialy, baby, go! 
BIALYSTOCK (Bloom's thought makes him unhappy) OI.  I'm depressed.  Leo, do me a favor.  Open the safe.  I want to see the money. 
LEO, HUMORING HIM, SPINS THE COMBINATION DIAL ON SAFE AND OPENS IT. 
CUT TO INSIDE OF SAFE.  IT IS JAMMED FULL OF NEATLY STACKED PILES OF MONEY. 
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK ON HIS HANDS AND KNEES IN FRONT OF SAFE. 
BIALYSTOCK (to himself.  Inhales deeply) That's better. 
BIALYSTOCK TAKES OUT A STACK OF NEATLY FOLDED BILLS.  HE SMELLS IT, KISSES IT AND PUTS IT IN HIS POCKET. 
BLOOM What are you doing? 
BIALYSTOCK I'm going to buy a toy.  I worked very, very hard and I think I deserve a toy. 
BLOOM (quizzically) A toy? 
DISSOLVE TO CLOSE-UP, FACE OF A GORGEOUS BLONDE, ULLA. DOLLY BACK TO REVEAL THE REST OF HER.  SHE IS INCREDIBLY WELL-ENDOWED. 
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEIR EYES GLUED TO HER FORM. 
BLOOM That's a toy? 
BIALYSTOCK Yes.  She's an adult, educational toy made in Sweden for children over fifty. 
BLOOM STARES AT HIM. 
BIALYSTOCK Stop looking at me like that. She's not an indulgence.  She happens to be our new receptionist. She goes with our new surroundings. 
QUICKLY PAN POSH NEW WALL-PAPER, FURNISHINGS, ETC. 
BIALYSTOCK Ulla, I'd like you to meet my partner and associate, Mr. Leo Bloom. 
ULLA Got dag pa dig. 
BLOOM How do you do. (to Bialystock) Have you gone mad?  A receptionist that can't speak English.  What will people say? 
BIALYSTOCK They'll say, "Oooh, wah, wah, wah, ooh, ooh." 
BLOOM What is she gonna do here? 
BIALYSTOCK I'll show you.  Ulla, go to work. 
ULLA Ya, sur. 
ULLA GOES TO PHONOGRAPH AND PLACES NEEDLE ON RECORD.  THE DRIVING SOUND OF A TWIST FILLS THE ROOM.  ULLA SENSUOUSLY TWISTS, VIBRATES, FRUGS, WATUSIS AND ROCKS HER BODY IN TIME WITH MUSIC. 
BIALYSTOCK See, it helps the day go by.  Ulla, okay.  Okay. 
ULLA STOPS, GOES TO PHONOGRAPH AND TAKES NEEDLE OFF. 
BIALYSTOCK Go to desk.  Answer telephone. 
HE PICKS UP PHONE TO SHOW HER. 
BIALYSTOCK Bialystock and Bloom.  Bialystock and Bloom. 
ULLA (repeating to herself as she leaves) Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum.  Bialystock and Blum. Got dag pa dig.  Bialystock and Blum. 
BIALYSTOCK (to Bloom, opening up a box on his desk) Hey, Blum, have a cigar. 
BLOOM What do you mean? 
THE DOOR OPENS.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS A THIN, STRANGE LOOKING MAN IN A BLACK TURTLENECK SWEATER.  (CARMEN GIYA) HE CONTEMPLATES THEM COLDLY. 
CARMEN Yesssssss? 
BIALYSTOCK I am Max Bialystock.  This is my associate, Mr. Bloom.  We have an appointment with Mr. De Bris. 
CARMEN Ah, yes, you're expected.  Please come in. 
THEY ENTER THE VESTIBULE.  CARMEN CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND THEM. 
CARMEN How do you do.  I'm Carmen Giya, Mr. De Bris' private secretary.  Would you be so kind as to remove your shoes. 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER BEWILDERED. 
CARMEN White, white, white is the color of our carpets. 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM REMOVE THEIR SHOES. 
CARMEN (to Bloom indicating a rack of slippers) Now, let's see, you're wearing grey. I would suggest the crimson. They're a little vivid, but your suit is so quiet. (to Bialystock, studying his mish mash attire) Why don't you... Oh, take anything. Please follow me. 
CARMEN LEADS THE WAY.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCUFF AFTER HIM. WE FOLLOW THEM DOWN A NARROW CORRIDOR LINED WITH EXAMPLES OF CLASSIC GREEK SCULPTURE -- EACH ONE DEPICTING NUDE MALES IN VARIOUS POSES. 
INT: ELEVATOR. 
CUT TO ROGER DE BRIS' BOUDOIR SITTING ROOM.  IT IS ELEGANTLY FEMININE. 
CHAISE LOUNGE, ANTIQUE MIRRORS, LOUIS XVI ARMOIRE AND DRESSING TABLE.  FROM BEHIND AN ORNATE DRESSING SCREEN, WE HEAR MUFFLED SOUNDS OF DISCONTENT. 
DE BRIS (from behind screen) I'll never get into this damned thing. 
CUT TO BOUDOIR ENTRANCE.  CARMEN, BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ENTER. 
CARMEN (to De Bris) We're not alone. 
DE BRIS' HEAD POPS OVER THE SCREEN.  HE IS A ONCE HANDSOME, NOW DISSIPATED MAN IN HIS LATE FORTIES. 
DE BRIS Ah, Messers Bialystock and Bloom, I presume.  Ha, ha, ha, forgive the pun. 
BLOOM (to Bialystock) What pun? 
BIALYSTOCK (a curt whisper) Shut up.  He thinks he's witty. (to De Bris) It's good to see you again, Roger. Did you get a chance to read "Springtime For Hitler?" 
DE BRIS EMERGES FROM BEHIND THE SCREEN.  HE IS WEARING A "LADY WINDERMERE'S FAN" STYLE DRESS. 
DE BRIS Remarkable.  Remarkable.  A stunning piece of work. 
BLOOM (shocked, whispers) Max!  He's wearing a dress. (his mouth remains open) 
BIALYSTOCK Shhhhhh. 
DE BRIS (continuing) I think it's a very important play. I, for one, never realized that the Third Reich meant Germany.  I mean it's drenched with historical goodies like that. 
DE BRIS IS SUDDENLY AWARE OF BLOOM'S EXPRESSION.  (BLOOM'S MOUTH IS STILL AGAPE.) 
DE BRIS Oh, dear, you're staring at my dress.  I should explain.  I'm going to the Choreographer's Ball tonight.  There's a prize for the best costume. 
CARMEN (smugly) We always win. 
DE BRIS (looking in the mirror) I'm not so sure about tonight.  I'm supposed to be the Grand Duchess -- I think I look more like Tugboat Annie.  What do you think? 
CUT TO STAGE.  AS THE OVERTURE IS CONCLUDED, THE CURTAIN SLOWLY RISES.  ON STAGE THERE IS A LINE OF GIRLS DRESSED IN SEXY STORM TROOPER COSTUMES--BLACK PATENT LEATHER BOOTS, ETC. THEIR ARMS ARE LINKED ABOUT ONE ANOTHER AS THEY DANCE AND KICK IN RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL ROCKETTE FASHION. 
STORM TROOPER CHORUS (singing) Germany was having trouble, What a sad, sad story. Needed a new leader To restore its former glory. Where, oh, where was he, Who could that man be, We looked around, And then we found, The man for you and me, And now its... 
THE STORM TROOPER ROCKETTES PART AND FROM ABOVE THEM, DESCENDING TWIN STAIRCASES, WE SEE TWO LINES OF BEAUTIFUL SHOWGIRLS, HOLDING HUGE BALLOONS ABOVE THEIR HEADS.  ON EACH BALLOON IS PAINTED A PICTURE OF THE FUHRER.  EVERYONE SINGS AS THEY DESCEND. 
ENTIRE CHORUS (singing) "Springtime for Hitler," etc. 
CUT TO AUDIENCE.  NUMBER ON STAGE CONTINUES. 
CLOSE-UP OF MAN AND WOMAN ON AISLE. 
WOMAN (DOWAGER) This is shocking! 
CUT TO ANOTHER AREA OF AUDIENCE.  ANOTHER COUPLE. 
MAN (STUFFED SHIRT) Outrageous! 
CUT TO CRITIC ON THE AISLE, BIALYSTOCK'S P.O.V.  HE SCOWLS AS HE FURIOUSLY MAKES NOTES. 
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM AT BACK OF THEATRE.  THEY ARE SMILING.  BIALYSTOCK POINTS TO COUPLE WHO HAVE LEFT THEIR SEATS AND STARTED UP THE AISLE. 
BIALYSTOCK Ahhhhh, it's going better than I expected. 
THE COUPLE COMES ABREAST OF BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM. 
WOMAN (to man as they exit theatre) Well, talk about bad taste. 
BIALYSTOCK (he chuckles as they leave) Come, let us repair to the bar across the street.  I don't want to be caught here during intermission. We'll be stoned to death. 
THEY LINK ARMS AND MERRILY MARCH OUT OF THE THEATRE. 
CUT TO STAGE.  "SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER" OPENING IS ENDING IN A GREAT CRESCENDO OF PATRIOTIC INSANITY. 
ENTIRE CHORUS (singing) So Springtime for Hitler, Is Springtime for Goering, Is Springtime for Goebbels, Is Springtime for Himmler, Is Springtime for you and me!! 
CURTAIN FALLS.  THE NUMBER IS RECEIVED BY THE AUDIENCE WITH HUSHED SILENCE.  FOLLOWED BY A SURGE TOWARD THE DOORS.  THE AISLES ARE CHOKED WITH UNHAPPY PEOPLE, WHO CAN'T WAIT TO GET OUT. 
CURTAIN RISES.  ON STAGE ARE EVA BRAUN AND HITLER (LSD). EVA BRAUN IS A FETCHING BLONDE IN LONG BRAIDS.  LSD IS PACING UP AND DOWN.  EVA BRAUN SITS ON LOVE SEAT DOWNSTAGE. IN HER HAND IS AN OVERSIZED DAISY.  AS SHE PULLS THE PETALS FROM IT, SHE WHINES.  SHE HAS A PRONOUNCED AMERICAN ACCENT. 
EVA Er liebt mir.  Er liebt mir nicht. Er liebt mir. (the last petal) Er liebt mir nicht. 
CUT TO PEOPLE IN AISLE.  THEY HAVE NOTICEABLY SLOWED DOWN. SOME ARE WALKING BACKWARDS.  THEY ARE INTRIGUED. 
CUT BACK TO STAGE. 
EVA (turns to LSD) Du liebt mir nicht! 
LSD (protesting vehemently) I lieb you baby, I lieb you.  You know that. 
EVA If you lieb me, why are you leaving me? 
LSD Hey, man, I can't spend all my time with you.  I took an oath, baby, Deutschland uber alles. 
CUT TO AUDIENCE IN AISLES.  THEY HAVE ALL STOPPED LEAVING TO TURN AND WATCH.  SOME BEGIN TO LAUGH AND OTHERS APPLAUD. THEY LIKE LSD. 
MAN That's Hitler?  I get it!  It's a put-on. 
CUT TO WOMAN. 
WOMAN Hey, Harry, he's funny. 
BIALYSTOCK "I want to croon, 
BLOOM AND DRUNK "He wants to croon, he wants to croon, 
BIALYSTOCK "To my honey I'll croon, 
BLOOM AND DRUNK "He's gonna croon love's tune, 
BIALYSTOCK "Honeymoon, 
BLOOM AND DRUNK "Honeymoon, honeymoon, 
BIALYSTOCK "Keep a shining in... 
BIALYSTOCK STOPS ABRUPTLY.  HE POINTS TOWARD THE DOOR.  WE HEAR THE SOUND OF PEOPLE ENTERING THE BAR. 
BIALYSTOCK Intermission!  Quick, hide your face.  They'll tear us to pieces. 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM HOP ON THEIR STOOLS AND COVER THEIR FACES WITH THEIR HANDS.  THE DRUNK SHRUGS, HOPS ON THE STOOL NEXT TO THEM AND ALSO HIDES HIS FACE.  A HORDE OF FIRST NIGHTERS SWEEPS INTO THE BAR.  THEY ARE ALL AROUND BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND THE DRUNK, CLAMORING FOR DRINKS. 
CROWD (ad-lib) "Scotch on the rocks," "Bourbon and soda." "Two martinis." "Whiskey sour." 
THE CROWD IS VERY CHEERFUL.  THEY ARE STILL BUBBLING FROM THE FIRST ACT. 
WOMAN (to her escort) Well, so far that's about the funniest thing I've ever seen on Broadway. 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER. 
WOMAN'S ESCORT Never laughed so much in my life. 
MAN (to his friend) Hysterical, absolutely hysterical. 
MAN'S FRIEND I thought I'd split my sides. 
BIALYSTOCK Take it easy, don't panic.  There are a lot of plays on this street. They are not necessarily talking about "Springtime For Hitler." 
HUSBAND (to his wife) Honey, I never in a million years thought I'd ever love a show called "Springtime For Hitler." 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM FREEZE.  A LITTLE OLD LADY COMES UP BEHIND BIALYSTOCK.  SHE RAPS HIM ON THE BACK WITH HER UMBRELLA. 
LITTLE OLD LADY #8 Bialy, you sly fox, you've done it. It's a smasheroo. 
BIALYSTOCK (in a daze) Smasheroo.  Smasheroo. 
THE CROWD STARTS TO LEAVE. 
LITTLE OLD LADY Oh, I'd better hurry back.  I don't want to miss one minute of it. 
THE FIRST NIGHTERS LEAVE THE BAR.  ALL THAT REMAIN ARE BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM, THE BARTENDER AND THE DRUNK. BIALYSTOCK SLIPS OFF THE STOOL AND WANDERS TO MIDDLE OF BARROOM. 
BIALYSTOCK (dazed) Got to think... Got to think... Got to think... Got to think... Got to think... 
CUT TO BLOOM AT THE BAR, FROZEN, STARING STRAIGHT AHEAD. HIS EYES ARE GLAZED WITH SHOCK.  HE STROKES HIS CHEEK WITH HIS LITTLE BLUE BLANKET. 
BLOOM Mrs. Cathcart -- 50% Mrs. Biddlecombe -- 50% Mrs. Wentworth -- 50% Mrs. Resnick -- 100% 
THE DRUNK STARES FROM ONE TO THE OTHER.  UNHAPPY WITH THEIR PRESENT MOOD, HE DECIDES TO LIVEN THINGS UP AGAIN.  HE TIPTOES OVER TO BIALYSTOCK, PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND BIALYSTOCK'S WAIST, ROCKS BACK AND FORTH AND BEGINS TO SING. 
DRUNK (singing) "By the light... By the light, by the light... Of the silvery... 
BIALYSTOCK PICKS HIM UP AND THROWS HIM ACROSS THE BAR. 
BIALYSTOCK Double.  Double.  Double. 
WITH A MIGHTY WRENCH, BIALYSTOCK RIPS THE BOOKS OUT OF BLOOM'S HANDS. 
BIALYSTOCK (clutching the books triumphantly) Haaaaa!  Haaaaa!  Haaaaa! 
BLOOM FLIPS.  HE ATTACKS BIALYSTOCK LIKE A CRAZY KID, SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY AND PUNCHING WITH ONE ARM AS HE PROTECTS HIS FACE WITH THE OTHER. 
BLOOM (shrieking) FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT!  FAT! 
BIALYSTOCK GOES CRASHING TO THE FLOOR UNDER THE ONSLAUGHT. BLOOM DIVES ON TOP OF HIM.  THEY ROLL ON THE FLOOR LOCKED IN MORTAL COMBAT.  SUDDENLY THREE SHOTS RING OUT IN SUCCESSION. BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM IMMEDIATELY STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND TURN TOWARD THE DOOR. 
CUT TO LOCK AND HANDLE OF DOOR.  THEY DROP OFF.  A LITTLE SMOKE RISES FROM THE HOLE. 
LIEBKIND (off screen, outside door) I am betrayed! 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER. 
CUT TO THE DOOR.  IT FLIES OPEN.  FRAMED IN THE DOORWAY IS FRANZ LIEBKIND, SMOKING LUGER IN HAND. 
LIEBKIND (solemnly) You have broken the Siegfried Oath. You must die. 
HE BLASTS AWAY.  THE WINDOW IS SHATTERED.  PIECES OF WALL GO WHIZZING THROUGH THE AIR.  BIALYSTOCK DROPS THE LEDGERS AND HE AND BLOOM DIVE FOR COVER BEHIND THE DESK. 
LIEBKIND This is no good.  I'm not killing you.  Don't you understand, you have broken the Siegfried Oath. You must die.  Vill you cooperate!!! 
CUT TO TIGHT TWO SHOT.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM SCRUNCHED BEHIND DESK.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER IN AMAZEMENT.  THERE IS A TIMOROUS KNOCK AT THE DOOR. 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM (together) Come in.  Come in. 
ULLA ENTERS. 
ULLA I hear noise.  You call? 
SHE LOOKS AROUND. 
ULLA Where are you? 
SHE CONTINUES WALKING UNTIL SHE SEES THEM CROUCHED BEHIND THE DESK. 
ULLA Ahhh.  I see you.  You like something?  Coffee? 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM LOOK AT EACH OTHER IN DISBELIEF. 
BIALYSTOCK Coffee.  Yes.  That's a good idea. (with great emphasis) Why don't you ask the gentleman with the gun... The gentleman who is shooting at us... and trying to kill us... what he will have. 
ULLA (to Liebkind) You like coffee? 
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM.  THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER, DUMBFOUNDED. 
LIEBKIND Yes, please.  Black.  Two sugars. 
ULLA REPEATS TO HERSELF AS SHE STARTS FOR THE DOOR. 
ULLA Three coffees.  Two regular.  One black... two sugars. 
SHE EXITS AND CLOSES THE DOOR BEHIND HIM. 
BIALYSTOCK LOOKS UP TO THE FATES AND MAKES A SMALL SOUND OF DESPAIR. 
LIEBKIND And now ve must resume hostilities. Are you coming out from behind that desk or not? 
CUT TO CLOSE-UP LIEBKIND.  HIS FACE A POSTER OF SHINING APPROVAL. 
CAMERA PULLS BACK.  THE THREE OF THEM SEARCH EACH OTHER'S FACES EARNESTLY.  THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY IN ACCORD. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN.  DARKENED CELLAR OF THEATRE.  WE SEE THE FAINT GLOW OF A SHIELDED LAMP AT THE END OF A TUNNEL.  AS THE CAMERA MOVES THROUGH TUNNEL CLOSER AND CLOSER TO THE LIGHT, WE MAKE OUT THE SHADOWY FORMS OF THREE MEN. 
CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO REVEAL BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND. BLOOM IS HOLDING A MINER'S LAMP.  LIEBKIND IS TRYING BRICK LOOSE FROM WALL.  BIALYSTOCK IS CONSULTING MAP.  BRICK COMES LOOSE.  LIEBKIND REMOVES IT. 
LIEBKIND (the surgeon at work) Dynamite. 
BLOOM SLAPS A NEATLY TAPED BUNDLE OF DYNAMITE INTO LIEBKIND'S HAND.  LIEBKIND GENTLY PLACES IT IN OPENING. 
LIEBKIND Fuse cap. 
BIALYSTOCK REACHES INTO HIS POCKET AND HANDS HIM A FUSE CAP. LIEBKIND PUTS CAP IN PLACE. 
LIEBKIND Fuse. 
BLOOM REACHES IN POCKET, TAKES OUT SPOOL OF FUSE, HANDS IT TO LIEBKIND. 
LIEBKIND Thank you. 
LIEBKIND TIES FUSE IN PLACE. 
LIEBKIND Gut.  Now for the master connection. 
CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM AS THEY MOVE BACK THROUGH THE TUNNEL. LIEBKIND TRAILS FUSE FROM SPOOL.  THEY FINALLY EMERGE INTO AN OPEN AREA OF CELLAR DIRECTLY BENEATH THE STAGE. 
LIEBKIND Gut.  Now vhere's the other fuse? 
BLOOM RAISES HIS LAMP, REVEALING A SIMILAR TUNNEL ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CELLAR. 
BLOOM There it is. 
CAMERA INSERT: CLOSE-UP SIMILAR FUSE PROTRUDING FROM SECOND TUNNEL. 
BACK TO SCENE. 
LIEBKIND (to Bloom) Pick it up and bring it here, please. 
BLOOM Okay. 
HE STARTS TOWARD SECOND TUNNEL. 
LIEBKIND (anxiously) Where are you going vit the light? 
BLOOM I need it.  How'm I gonna find the fuse? 
LIEBKIND Oh, ve come vit you.  All for one and all in the light. 
THE THREE OF THEM GINGERLY TIPTOE OVER TO SECOND TUNNEL ENTRANCE.  BLOOM PICKS UP THE FUSE.  THEY TIPTOE BACK. BLOOM HANDS FUSE TO LIEBKIND. 
LIEBKIND REACHES INTO HIS KNAPSACK, TAKES OUT LITTLE BLACK METAL BOX WITH TWO TERMINAL CAPS AT EITHER END AND SETS IT DOWN ON CELLAR FLOOR. 
LIEBKIND Now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business. 
BIALYSTOCK (grinning) You mean out of business.  Heh, heh. 
LIEBKIND BEGINS FIDDLING WITH THE FUSE LEADS AND TERMINALS. 
BIALYSTOCK You mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on? 
LIEBKIND Yes.  Amazing isn't it? 
BIALYSTOCK RAISES HIS CANE AND SMASHES LIEBKIND ON THE HELMET.  BONNNG. 
BIALYSTOCK You stupid kraut! 
LIEBKIND Vhy do you always call me kraut? Kraut is cabbage!  Do ve call you hot dogs?  Ve call you Yanks not franks! 
BIALYSTOCK All right.  Finish the job.  Let's get outta here. 
CUT TO SIDE DOOR OF THEATRE.  THE DOOR OPENS SLOWLY. BIALYSTOCK, BLOOM AND LIEBKIND TIPTOE OUT.  BLOOM SETS DETONATOR DOWN. 
LIEBKIND Und now for the final connection. 
HE WRAPS THE FUSE LEAD AROUND THE METAL CONTACT POLE AND RAISES THE PLUNGER. 
BIALYSTOCK Wait.  I'll check to see if the coast is clear. 
HE RUNS TO THE END OF THE ALLEY.  LOOKS BOTH WAYS AND RUNS BACK. 
BIALYSTOCK The coast is clear! 
LIEBKIND Good.  Get down. 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM CROUCH DOWN AND HOLD THEIR EARDRUMS. LIEBKIND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR.  HIS EYES SUDDENLY GLISTEN WITH TEARS. 
LIEBKIND Goodbye, my foolish fancy.  Goodbye, my misbegotten child.  Goodbye, my tortured testament of twisted truths. 
BIALYSTOCK Do it!  Do it! 
LIEBKIND TENSES HIMSELF FOR THE PLUNGE.  HE STARTS AND STOPS. 
LIEBKIND I can't.  I can't do it.  It's a demon.  It's a gargoyle, it's a monster... but it's still my child. 
HE SOBS INCONSOLABLY.  BIALYSTOCK ROUGHLY PUSHES HIM ASIDE AND GRABS THE HANDLE OF THE DETONATOR AND PLUNGES IT DOWN. HE HURLS HIMSELF TO THE GROUND AND COVERS HIS HEAD IN ANTICIPATION OF THE EXPLOSION.  NOTHING HAPPENS.  AFTER A WHILE THEY ALL RAISE THEIR HEADS CURIOUSLY. 
BIALYSTOCK (quizzically) Nothing. 
LIEBKIND GOES TO PLUNGER, RAISES HANDLE AND EXAMINES DETONATOR. 
LIEBKIND Here is gut... of course, of course. In electricity, it's always male to female.  But with people, it's not always so.  Come ve must go back. 
BIALYSTOCK Do you need us? 
LIEBKIND Of course I need you.  It's dark in there. 
BLOOM Okay, okay.  Let's not waste time. 
THEY OPEN THE SIDE DOOR AND DISAPPEAR INTO THE THEATRE. 
DRUNK (off camera, singing) "Honeymoon, keep a shinin' in June," 
CUT TO ENTRANCE OF ALLEY.  DRUNK COMES STAGGERING INTO VIEW. HE SPOTS DETONATOR. 
DRUNK "your silvery beams, Will light love's dreams,"  What the heck is that?  A bicycle pump? Naaah.  Lemme see.  Could it be? Good grief, it's Eli Whitney's cotton gin... Naaah.  Aahh, I know what it is. 
HE WALKS OVER TO DETONATOR AND SITS ON FIRE STANCHION JUST BEHIND IT.  HE RAISES HIS FOOT AND STARTS IT DOWN TOWARD THE PLUNGER. 
DRUNK Shine 'em up!

INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BEDROOM - DAY 
BLINDING WHITENESS We hear a MAN GASPING softly.     Rhythmically. A LUMINOUS PALE SHAPE slowly forms out of the searing whiteness. Gradually we realize we're moving across the ALABASTER BODY of a WOMAN. Her skin translucent. 
ON THE WOMAN'S FACE Ethereal.   Her eyes closed.     Her face lifeless.   Then... ...her eyes open. She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. This is ANNA (late 20s). We pull back. PAUL (30s) makes love to Anna. Their movements perfunctory. Passionless. He turns to look at her. Realizes she's not there. He suddenly stops. Rolls off her. Sits on the edge of the bed. 
PAUL What's wrong? 
ANNA Nothing. Anna leans down and picks up her RED SLIP from the floor. 
PAUL 
(SIGHS WEARILY) You used to enjoy it. Now it's... He shakes his head.    Frustrated.   Lights a cigarette. 
PAUL ...it's like fucking a corpse. Paul immediately realizes he's gone too far.      Turns to Anna. 
PAUL Shit.   I'm sorry.   That was-- Anna gets out of bed. Walks towards the bathroom.       Paul puts his head in his hands. 
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Through the fogged shower partition we see the blurred ghostly figure of Anna. Paul walks in. 
PAUL Anna. I'm sorry. That was a stupid thing to say.   But you know sometimes... sometimes it's like you're not here anymore. Like you're somewhere else. 
Anna doesn't reply. 
PAUL Is this about us? 
ON ANNA her head bowed as she lets the water wash over her. 
ANNA It's not about us. 
PAUL (O.C.) Then what is it? 
ANNA I don't know. 
PAUL (O.C.) I just want us to be happy. Anna doesn't move.    We sense the emptiness inside her. 
PAUL (O.C.) Are you happy? She closes her eyes.    Forces herself to reply. 
ANNA I'm happy. 
A DROP OF BLOOD falls into the water.   Then another drop. 
ON ANNA her nose is bleeding. She touches her lips. Looks impassively at the blood on her fingertips. The SOUND OF WATER carries into the next scene... 
FADE TO WHITE. 
A STREAM OF CRYSTAL BLUE WATER A MAN'S HANDS penetrate the water. Thin and elegant. Perfectly manicured. Turning slowly as he washes them meticulously. He picks up a crisply folded white towel. Dries his hands carefully. Snaps on white latex gloves. 
EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING 
A beautiful morning. We move through a tranquil cemetery. Pastoral and idyllic. Dappled light falls through old trees onto statues of grieving angels. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS 
A path leads to an old well-kept house. Amongst a blaze of violet tulips we see a sign: Eliot Deane. Funeral Home. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. CASKET DISPLAY ROOM - MORNING 
JACK I think it's dead. Anna reaches in.   Tenderly picks up the chick. 
ANNA No.   The poor thing's just scared. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAY 
School's over. Anna listlessly corrects a stack of exercise books. She can't focus. Pulls out a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes a pill into her hand. Swallows it dry. 
INT. LAW OFFICE. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Paul works with half a dozen COLLEAGUES around a large conference table covered with documents and thick files. He reaches across to a pizza box. It's empty. 
PAUL OK.   Who took the last pepperoni? A PREPPY GUY slides across another pizza box. 
PAUL Great.  Broccoli. (lifts out a slice) Who the fuck ordered broccoli? NEAL, a thin pallid guy, looks up. 
NEAL Oh that's just disgusting. 
PREPPY GUY What's wrong with vegetarian pizza?   It's healthy. 
NEAL Pizza isn't supposed to be healthy. Paul glances at his watch. Suddenly realizes the time. He quickly picks up his cell phone. Heads for the door. 
NEAL You ordering in another pizza? 
PAUL Yeah.    With wheatgrass and alfalfa sprouts. Everyone laughs. 
PREPPY GUY 
(MUTTERS) Yeah. Yeah. Smart asses. 
INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 
Paul walks into the corridor dialling his cell phone. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - SAME TIME 
Anna's cell phone rings as she closes her locker. She fishes it out from her bag as she heads to the door. Checks the ID. Hesitates. Then takes the call. 
INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME 
Paul cups his cell.    Worried he'll be overheard. 
PAUL Hi baby.    I'm really sorry about this morning.    I fucked up. I know. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME 
Anna steps into an empty corridor. 
PAUL (O.S.) 
(FILTERED) We still on for tonight? 
(BEAT) Anna? 
ANNA I don't know Paul. 
INT. LAW OFFICE. CORRIDOR - SAME TIME 
Paul's anxious.    We sense he's hiding something. 
PAUL Please Anna.    It took me weeks to get the table. 
ANNA (O.S.) 
(FILTERED) Maybe we can change it to Thursday-- 
PAUL No.     It has to be tonight. 
MRS. HUTTON White roses. They were his favorite. How did you know? 
ELIOT They just seemed appropriate somehow. 
MRS. HUTTON He looks so peaceful. As if he's only sleeping. Anna approaches Mrs. Hutton.   She doesn't notice Eliot watching her carefully. 
ANNA Mrs. Hutton.    I'm so sorry. 
MRS. HUTTON Thank you Anna. You were always his favorite student. 
Anna smiles awkwardly.     Uncomfortable. 
MRS. HUTTON How's your mother? 
ANNA Fine.   She sends her condolences. 
MRS. HUTTON You look tired dear. 
ANNA No.   I'm fine. Everything's fine. But we can see in her eyes that everything's not fine. Mrs. Hutton nods, then turns to greet another MOURNER. Anna steps nervously up to the coffin. 
ANNA'S POV James Hutton lies peacefully amongst the velvet trimming. Suddenly his LIPS PART... as he GASPS SOFTLY. 
VIEWING ROOM Anna steps back terrified. Stares at Hutton. His face serene again. It must have been her imagination. She glances up quickly. Embarrassed. Eliot's still observing her.     He nods to her cordially. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY 
A spartan room at the top of the house. Eliot carefully pins a POLAROID of Hutton lying in a coffin to the wall. Next to Hutton's photograph, we briefly glimpse the edge of ANOTHER POLAROID. Eliot stares intently at Hutton's image for a moment, then takes off his jacket and moves to the window. 
ELIOT'S POV Anna's by her car rummaging in a bag for her keys. Getting increasingly frustrated. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - DAY 
Anna suddenly looses it. Angrily dumps the contents of her bag onto the driveway. She kneels down. Grabs the keys. Throws the rest of her things back into the bag. She stands. Leans against the car. She looks weary. She glances up at the sky desperately trying to hold back her tears. Black storm clouds gather on the horizon. 
Anna brusquely wipes away her eyes with the back of her hand. Pulls herself together. Angry with herself. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY 
Eliot watches intently as Anna drives away. 
INT. RESTAURANT - EVENING 
Paul sits at a window table. It's raining hard outside. He glances at his watch then nervously checks his pockets. Pulls out a RING BOX. He looks at it for a moment then slips it back into his pocket. As he refills his glass, Anna appears outside holding her raincoat above her head. She stares at Paul for a moment through the window marbled with rain. Paul suddenly notices Anna at the window.   He starts. Spills some of his red wine on his shirt. CLOSE on the red stain. It unfurls like a flower. Spreading out over the white material. 
ANNA (O.C.) Sorry about that. Paul dabs the stain with a napkin. 
PAUL You scared the life out of me. Anna laughs as she sits down.   Paul looks up at her. 
PAUL Your hair. 
ANNA You don't like it. 
PAUL I didn't say that. It's just very... red. I mean it's not really you is it? A WAITER appears at the table before Anna can reply. 
WAITER Are you ready to order? 
PAUL Yes.    We'll have the duck. 
ANNA Paul. 
PAUL What?    You always have the duck here. 
ANNA (picks up the menu) I don't always have the duck. Paul shrugs. Pours Anna some wine as she looks through the menu. The Waiter taps his pen on his pad impatiently. Anna sighs. Puts the menu aside. 
ANNA I'll have the duck. Paul smiles as the Waiter leaves. Anna tries to ignore him. But after a second she can't help smiling back. 
PAUL The duck is very good. Anna's smile broadens. The tension between them broken for the moment. Paul reaches across. Touches her hand. 
PAUL Anna. Open the door. Please. I want you to come with me. I want to... 
INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Anna can't hear him above the sound of the RAIN HAMMERING onto the car. She shakes her head. Puts the car in drive. 
EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 
Paul stumbles aside as Anna's car pulls away. She stops at the parking lot exit a short distance away. 
INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Anna looks up into the rearview mirror. 
ON REARVIEW MIRROR Paul stands forlornly in the rain.      Their eyes meet. 
ANNA'S CAR She hesitates.       For a moment we think she might go back to him... 
EXT. RESTAURANT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 
... but then Anna pulls out and drives away. Leaving Paul alone in the parking lot. The rain pounding the asphalt. 
INT/EXT. ANNA'S CAR. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Anna peers through the blurred windshield as the wipers battle with the TORRENTIAL DOWNPOUR. A LARGE TRUCK plows past menacingly on the rain-slicked highway. Anna's still upset. She wipes away her tears. On the dashboard the kitschy doll bobs its head from side to side. Anna picks up her cell phone. Glances down as she dials a number. She looks up... a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows cuts in front of her. 
ANNA Shit! Anna swerves into the next lane.      We hear the blaring horn from the car behind her. 
ANNA (into rear-view mirror) OK. OK. I saw you. 
(MUTTERING) Jerk. The cell phone connects.      We hear Paul's answering machine. 
ANNA Paul? You home yet? Can you pick up?      I just don't want it to end like this. Anna drops the phone into her bag on the passenger seat. Wipes away the mist on the inside of the glass. A TRACTOR TRAILER shudders past loaded with metal pipes. 
ON METAL PIPES The badly loaded pipes BANG OMINOUSLY against each other. 
CUT TO BLACK. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
Darkness.   A bright light comes on. CLOSE ON a MAN'S HANDS. Turning slowly under a stream of crystal blue water. We pull back. Eliot dries his hands. Opens a cabinet. Takes out a pair of latex gloves. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EARLY MORNING 
A large room. Tall vaulted ceilings. White tiles. Soft morning light seeps in from a small round window set high on one wall. The room is silent. Still. Like a chapel. In the semi-darkness we see a BODY on a porcelain slab covered with a white sheet. We hear a key turn in a lock. Then another lock.       The room's suddenly flooded with a harsh white light. Eliot steps inside the room. He takes off his jacket. Carefully places it on a coat-hanger. Puts on a pale blue smock then snaps on the latex gloves. His every move meticulous. Measured. Like a ritual. Eliot walks over to the slab, his surgery clogs softly clacking against the tiled floor. He looks at the slab for a moment then slowly pulls the sheet away revealing... ANNA'S BODY. Pale and lifeless. An ugly gash above her eyebrow. Cracked violet lips. A rip in her black dress soaked with a dark stain. She's only wearing one shoe. Eliot gently takes off the watch from her stiff wrist. Places it inside a brown paper bag. Eases off the shoe. Picks up a scalpel from a tray of instruments on a steel trolley. Delicately slices open her dress. Peels it off. He's about to cut the straps of her RED SLIP when... Anna OPENS HER EYES. She looks straight at us with unseeing pale blue eyes. Strangely Eliot's not surprised.   He calmly steps back. Watches her carefully. Anna's eyes slowly focus on Eliot.     She's groggy.   Confused. 
ANNA Where am I? She talks with difficulty.       Her breathe labored. 
ELIOT You're in a funeral home. 
(BEAT) You're dead. Anna's vacant eyes widen in shock. She struggles to sit up but she can't even raise her head. Her body stiff. Rigid. Eliot speaks to her calmly. Soothingly. 
ELIOT You had a car accident. It was raining. You hit a truck loaded with metal pipes. She looks fearfully at the bloodied dress in Eliot's hand. 
ANNA I'm not dead. 
ELIOT You were pronounced dead eight hours ago. Your blood no longer circulates through your body. Your brain cells are slowly dying. Your body's already decomposing. 
ANNA I'm not dead. Eliot looks at her sadly for a moment. He places the bloodied dress on the trolley. Then picks up a document. Holds it up for her. 
ON DOCUMENT It's Anna's death certificate. 
ELIOT (O.C.) This is your death certificate. Cause of death. Massive internal trauma. Time of death. 8.23PM. 
PREP ROOM 
ELIOT You were dead on arrival. The attending physician signed here... (points to document) ...at 9.45 last night. I picked up your body from the hospital morgue at 12.10 this morning. Anna stares with horror at her death certificate, then at Eliot. He looks away. It pains him to see her so distressed. 
PAUL 
(INTO PHONE) It's me again. I must have just missed you at home. Call me when you get this. OK? 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. CORRIDOR - DAY 
Paul strides down an empty corridor. The flowers in his hand. Searching for Anna's classroom. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. BIOLOGY CLASSROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
A TEACHER stands in front of the class holding a shell. 
TEACHER ... the shell grows slowly... The door opens. Paul steps into the classroom.    His smile fades as he realizes it's not Anna. 
PAUL Oh hi.   I'm looking for Anna Bryant. The Teacher quickly moves over.    Hustles Paul to the door. 
TEACHER 
(INDIGNANT) I'm sorry but you just can't-- 
PAUL I'm Anna's... fiancée. Paul Conran.     I thought this was her class. The Teacher glances suspiciously at the flowers in his hand. 
PAUL We had a little misunderstanding last night. 
TEACHER 
(HESITATES) She didn't come in today. Jack's in the front row.   Following the conversation. 
PAUL Did she call in sick? 
TEACHER She hasn't called in at all. It's not like her. She always calls in. Paul's worried now.   Something's wrong. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY 
Anna lies rigidly on the slab. Her head turned to one side. Staring blankly at the wall. Her eyes glazed. Suddenly classical music fills the room. Anna frowns. Disoriented. She moves her head with difficulty. Nervously looks around. For a moment she doesn't know where she is. Then she sees Eliot by a CD player. She watches with trepidation as he approaches her. 
ANNA Please don't hurt me. 
ELIOT 
(SMILES) How can I hurt you?     You're already dead. 
ANNA But I'm not dead. 
ELIOT Then why are you here? Anna doesn't know what to say.   She turns her head away. A tear falls down her cheek. 
ANNA Please. Just let me go. I won't go to the police. I won't tell anyone. Eliot moves her head back.   Gently wipes away her tear. 
ELIOT You're still in denial. You have to trust me. I'm only here to help you. Eliot slides a wooden head-rest under her neck and studies her wounds, touching them delicately. Thinking about how to conceal them. He turns to a tray of instruments. Picks up a needle. Leans over Anna. The needle pierces her brow. Sliding cleanly through her skin. She doesn't feel any pain as Eliot carefully sews the wound. He's meticulous. Clearly very good at his job. Eliot glances at his watch. Picks up a SYRINGE and an AMPOULE OF AMBER LIQUID. Draws up the amber liquid. Anna's alarmed. She tries to pull back. 
ELIOT Don't be scared. 
ANNA What are you doing? 
ELIOT This will relax your muscles. Stop the rigor mortis setting in so I can work on your body. He INJECTS Anna in the neck. Just then we hear a car pull up on the gravel driveway outside. 
ELIOT 
(TO HIMSELF) Your mother's early. Anna's eyelids feel very heavy. Slowly her eyes close. Eliot pulls the white sheet over her body. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
A Nurse, DIANE (30s) follows Beatrice in her wheelchair as Eliot leads them through the hallway. 
ELIOT I'm so very sorry Mrs. Bryant. It's always so tragic when you lose a child. 
BEATRICE I lost her years ago. He glances at her curiously.    Then gestures to his office. 
ANNA I don't believe you.   Why are you doing this to me? He shakes his head as he drops the towel into a small bin. 
ELIOT You're all the same. You all blame me for your death. As if it were my fault. 
ANNA No. You drugged me.    So my mother 
WOULDN'T-- 
ELIOT The others. They just see you as a dead body on a slab. Only I can see you as you really are. 
ANNA You're crazy! Eliot's taken aback.    Hurt. 
ELIOT I'm a busy man. I don't have time for this. He heads to the door. Pulls out his keys and unlocks it. Just then he remembers something. Turns to her. 
ELIOT Oh I nearly forgot.    How tall are you? 
ANNA What!? He looks her up and down.   Gauging her height. 
ELIOT Five seven. 
ANNA Why..? 
ELIOT I need to know how tall you are.   For your coffin. Anna's stunned. Eliot looks at her for a moment.     Then switches off the main lights. 
ANNA Wait! He ignores her.   The door CLICKS shut behind him. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Eliot steps into the hallway. Stops by a vase of flowers. He plucks a dead petal. Crushes it. Curiously sniffs his fingers. Then heads to the casket room. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON Anna's face. She looks empty. Dispirited. Just then something catches her attention... The light from the window glints off a pair of LARGE SCISSORS on the steel trolley. Anna stumbles to the trolley. Feeling her way through the semi-darkness. Grabs the scissors. Just then she notices a BODY, covered with a white sheet, lying on a gurney in the corner. She turns away. Scared. But then, almost against her will, she approaches the gurney. As if drawn to the body. She slowly pulls the sheet away... The dead body of an OLD WOMAN. Staring blindly at Anna with cloudy opaque eyes. Long greasy gray hair. Shaken, Anna pushes herself against the wall. 
ANNA Oh God.   Please. I don't want to die. 
INT. JACK'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - DAY 
Jack carefully cuts something out of a local newspaper. The loud sounds of a TV blare from another room. 
ON NEWSPAPER Schoolteacher Dies in Tragic Car Crash. 
INT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The curtains are drawn. JACK'S MOTHER sits in an armchair with her back to us watching TV. Jack walks in. 
JACK You were supposed to pick me up from school yesterday. His mother doesn't reply.   Jack moves in front of the TV. 
JACK I waited. His mother doesn't respond. 
EXT. STREETS - DAY 
Jack furiously cycles through empty streets. Past identical suburban houses with identical prim lawns. He stops suddenly. Considering something. Then turns and cycles away purposely. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 
Eliot walks out of the funeral home. We pull back. Jack stands by his bicycle in the bushes watching him. Eliot looks up. As if sensing someone was spying on him. Jack steps back quickly behind a tree. 
INT. POLICE STATION - DAY 
A POLICE OFFICER talks on the phone as Paul walks in. 
POLICE OFFICER 
(INTO PHONE) Hang on a sec. 
(TO PAUL) Mr. Conran. Heard about your girlfriend. I'm sorry. Paul nods.    Clearly doesn't want to talk about it. 
BEHIND ANNA'S BACK her hands clutch the large scissors. 
PREP ROOM Eliot opens a cabinet full of boxes of hair dye with photographs of smiling women. As he prepares the dye he looks across at Anna. She's staring at something behind him. Eliot turns. Sees the uncovered body of the Old Woman on the gurney. He quickly walks over. Carefully pulls the white sheet over the Old Woman. 
ANNA Who is she? 
ELIOT Mrs. Whitehall. He mixes the dye in a bowl as he moves over to Anna. 
ELIOT You shouldn't be afraid of her.   The dead can't harm the dead. 
ANNA 
(FORCEFULLY) But I'm not dead! Anna's hand suddenly FLIES UP...   she slashes at Eliot's face with the SCISSORS. The sharp edge misses his cheek by inches. Eliot drops the bowl. Stumbles back against the steel trolley. Instruments crash to the floor. Anna staggers to the door. Her legs weak. Her long lank hair falling over her eyes. She frantically wrenches at the door handle but it's locked. Eliot gets up. Slowly moves towards Anna. She turns. Raises the scissors. 
ANNA Stay where you are. 
ELIOT (holds out his hand) Give me the scissors. I only want to help you. 
ANNA Don't come any closer.     I swear to God I'll kill you. Eliot walks right up to her.     His face now inches from hers. 
ELIOT 
(CALMLY) Go ahead. Anna doesn't move. Eliot looks her steadily in the eye. He reaches for her hand. Slowly. Deliberately. He brings the scissors to his cheek. Then lets go of Anna's hand. 
CLOSE ON ELIOT'S FACE The sharp tip pushes into his skin. 
ELIOT Go on. 
PREP ROOM For a moment we think she might do it.      But then she wavers. 
ELIOT What are you waiting for? Anna's confidence falters. She slowly lowers her hand. The scissors fall onto the floor. Anna looks down defeated. Her breath labored. Suddenly she realizes... 
ANNA I'm breathing! (raises her head) Look. I'm still alive! 
ELIOT You think you're still alive because you're still attached to life. It's normal. You're just imagining you still have symptoms of life. She's not listening. Eliot takes a roll of paper towels. Kneels down, picks up the bowl of dye and mops up the mess. 
ANNA Maybe I was in some kind of coma. The doctors made a mistake. They're always making mistakes. 
ELIOT You died.   Everyone dies. 
ANNA How can I be dead if we're talking? He stands up.    Sighs wearily. 
ELIOT We're talking not because you're alive. But because I have a gift. 
(BEAT) I can talk to those between life and death. 
ANNA Why? 
ELIOT To help them make the transition. Anna's stunned. For the first time we sense a seed of doubt in her mind. 
ANNA Is this what happens when you die? 
ELIOT It depends on how you lived your life. 
ANNA What do you mean? 
ELIOT Not everyone needs my help. Some let go as soon as their body dies. Others don't let go until long after they're in the grave. 
ANNA Am I a ghost? Is that why I'm here? 
ELIOT You're here so I can bury you. Anna's silent. Trying to make sense of what she's just heard. Eliot takes her arm. Leads her to the slab. 
ELIOT Come.    We've wasted enough time already. She lies down submissively. Suddenly very tired.       Eliot leans over her to apply what's left of the dye. 
ANNA 
(WHISPERS) No.    Please. I don't want-- 
GIRL I am you. I've been waiting for you. You shouldn't have disappointed me. The Girl now looks strangely malevolent. Anna steps back terrified. Turns. But there's no door anymore. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME 
The Old Woman stands alone in the middle of the room. Braiding her long hair. 
OLD WOMAN You're not ready. 
CUT TO A SEARING WHITENESS. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY 
A small congregation of MOURNERS sit in the white chairs. "AVE MARIA" plays quietly in the b.g. A MAN leans over the casket paying his respects. 
ON CASKET The Old Woman.   Her long hair braided.   She looks serene. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME 
"AVE MARIA" filters into the room. Anna opens her eyes. She's confused. She gets up awkwardly. Looks around the room. The other slab's empty. The Old Woman's gone. Anna stumbles over to the trolley. Pushes it aside. Desperately searching for the tiny door. She touches the wall. There's nothing there. Frustrated she turns to a counter crowded with instruments. She sweeps her arm across the counter top in rage. Sending everything crashing to the floor. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - DAY 
The funeral's over. Eliot takes out a wilted bouquet of flowers from a vase. 
In the b.g. Jack stands half-hidden in the doorway. Glancing around in fascination. A flower in his hand. 
ELIOT (to Jack without looking up) Can I help you? Jack steps back timidly.   Eliot looks up.   Smiles. 
ELIOT Then perhaps you can help me. (holds up the withered flowers) Could you throw these away for me? Jack nods hesitantly.   Moves over and takes the flowers. 
ELIOT Thank-you. Eliot turns and arranges fresh flowers in the vase. 
ON JACK as he looks at the wilted flowers.    He crushes a petal then sniffs his fingers. 
ELIOT (O.C.) There's no life left in them. 
VIEWING ROOM Jack looks up.   Eliot's watching him carefully. 
ELIOT They belong in the garbage. Jack turns to leave. 
ELIOT I've seen you round here before. Jack's suddenly nervous. 
ELIOT Did you know Mrs. Whitehall? 
JACK I thought it was Miss Bryant's funeral. 
ELIOT Ah. Miss Bryant. No.       Her funeral's not until Friday. 
JACK Where is she now? Eliot considers the question for a moment. 
ELIOT She's downstairs. 
JACK Why? 
ELIOT Why?  Because she's not ready. 
(BEAT) Is the flower for her? 
JACK 
(NODS) She was my teacher. 
ELIOT And you are? 
JACK Jack. Jack holds out his hand. A serious look on his face. Eliot's amused. He shakes Jack's hand. 
ELIOT Well Jack.      What did you think? 
(WHISPERS) Paul. Paul turns quickly. Sees the open window. It's only the wind. He shivers. It suddenly got very cold. He gets up and closes the window. The WHISPERING starts again. This time from the bathroom. Paul walks over to the bathroom door. As he touches the door handle... the whispering STOPS. Paul hesitates. The room's strangely silent. He slowly opens the door... 
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Nothing. The bathroom's empty. Paul looks around nervously. He catches the reflection of his pallid face in the mirror. Leans wearily against the washbasin. 
Water DRIPS from a leaky pipe. The fluorescent bulb over the mirror CRACKLES softly. Paul turns on the taps. Splashes cold water on his face. He's about to reach for a towel when he senses something. He cocks his head slightly. A feeling. He turns and checks out the bathroom. Nothing. Paul dries his face. As he replaces the towel... the sound of dripping water ABRUPTLY STOPS. Silence. Suddenly the SHOWER STARTS RUNNING. Paul's paralyzed with fear. Steam wreathes the room in a cloud of vapor. He turns slowly towards the shower. 
PAUL'S POV Anna stands in front of the shower with her back to him. She slips off her bathrobe and hangs it on a hook. Then her hand moves to her chest. There's a STRANGE WET SUCKING sound... ...as Anna rips out her heart and hangs it casually on the hook next to her bathrobe. 
ON THE STILL BEATING HEART dripping crimson blood onto the bone white tiles. 
BATHROOM 
PAUL 
(WHISPERS) Anna. Anna turns slowly. Her skin's like alabaster. Unnaturally translucent. A bloody gash where her heart used to be. The steam from the shower curls around her like a mist. She looks hauntingly beautiful. Mesmerizing. A line of thick black fluid trickles from her nose. Paul turns away. Horrified. When he turns back a second later Anna's not there. The bathroom's empty. The shower's not even running. 
INT. JACK'S HOUSE. KITCHEN - EVENING 
Jack opens the fridge. It's almost empty. He takes out a carton of milk. Sniffs it. Recoils from the smell. From the living room we hear the LOUD sound of a TV. 
JACK 
(SHOUTS) Mom!    We're out of milk. There's no reply.      Jack grabs his jacket. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - EVENING 
Anna's still sitting on the floor. The place is clean and ordered again. She watches Eliot unzip a garment bag. He lifts out a plain black dress. 
ANNA What's that? 
ELIOT It's your dress. For your funeral. Your mother brought it round this morning. As Eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a plastic bag, Anna moves haltingly over to the dress. She touches the material puzzled. 
ANNA This isn't my dress. (realizes with shock) This is my mother's dress! It was supposed to be for her funeral. Why has she given it to me? Eliot starts folding the plastic bag. He notices something else inside. He opens the bag. Hesitates then takes something out. 
ON ELIOT'S HAND An old-fashioned wooden rosary. 
PREP ROOM Eliot looks at it for a moment. Then glances over at Anna. She's still staring at the dress. He opens a drawer beneath the counter. It's full of rosaries and printed Holy cards. He quickly drops the rosary into the drawer. Closes it. Then turns back to Anna. 
ANNA It should have been her not me. (turns to Eliot) She was the one dying. Not me. Eliot unlocks the door. Jams it open with a door stop. Slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. Takes off his jacket and hangs it up. He moves over to a collapsible gurney folded on the floor. Bends down and snaps open the side-rails. Anna looks at the open door. 
ANNA I'm not ready to die. Eliot looks up at Anna sadly. 
ELIOT Why are you still struggling? 
ANNA 
(PLAINTIVELY) I'm not ready to die.   Not yet. She glances at the open door again.    Eliot follows her look. 
ELIOT There's nothing out there for you anymore. As Eliot turns back to the gurney, Anna notices Eliot's jacket hanging beside her. Realizes the KEYS are in the pocket. She quickly glances back at Eliot. He's still busy adjusting the gurney. She leans over to his jacket. 
ON ELIOT as he gets up and turns to Anna. 
PREP ROOM Anna looks at him calmly. We can't tell if she managed to get his keys or not. Eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels the gurney through the door. He steps back into the room. Nudges the door stop away with his foot. 
ELIOT I'll be back soon. The door locks behind him with a CLICK. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Eliot pushes the gurney to a WHITE VAN with black tinted windows (Note: The same kind of van that cut in front of Anna just before the accident). 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - SAME TIME 
Anna listens anxiously to the CRUNCH of Eliot's feet on the gravel outside. After a moment she hears the van drive away. She unfurls her fist revealing Eliot's keys. 
INT/EXT. ELIOT'S VAN. STREETS - MOMENTS LATER 
He stands very still.    Watching.   Waiting.   We pull back. 
JUST AROUND THE CORNER Anna pushes herself against the wall clutching the knife. 
HALLWAY Eliot turns towards her... then at the last moment changes his mind. Heads in the opposite direction towards the viewing room. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Eliot steps carefully into the viewing room. Looks around. Just then we hear the sound of bare feet STAMPING along the hallway behind him. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME 
Anna runs to the front door. It's locked. She glances around anxiously. Sees a staircase leading upstairs. She weakly stumbles up the stairs. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER 
Anna walks along the corridor. She peers into a room. Notices a TELEPHONE on a table. She moves over to the telephone. The door CREAKS closed behind her. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ENTRANCE HALL - SAME TIME 
Eliot hears the CREAKING DOOR upstairs.    He cocks his head upwards. Straining to listen. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Anna frantically punches the buttons on the phone. 
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
A telephone RINGS in the empty kitchen. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME 
Anna rocks back and forth as she anxiously listens to the RINGING on the other end. 
ANNA 
(DESPERATELY) Please pick up. Please pick up. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. STAIRS - SAME TIME 
Eliot slowly climbs the stairs. 
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
The phone continues to RING. We pull back. Paul stares at the phone blankly. A drink in his hand. He looks worse than before. Dark circles under his eyes. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME 
Anna glances back to the door in panic. 
ANNA Paul.   Please pick up. 
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
Finally Paul reaches across and picks up the phone. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. UPSTAIRS ROOM - SAME TIME 
Anna cups her hand around the mouthpiece. 
ANNA 
(FRENZIED WHISPER) Paul. I'm here. 
INT. PAUL'S APARTMENT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
ANNA (O.S.) 
(RELIEVED) Oh God. 
PAUL Bad dream? 
ANNA I was dead. I had a car accident.     Did you ever dream you were dead? Paul doesn't reply.    She turns... the bed's empty. 
ANNA Paul? 
PAUL (O.C.) Yes? Anna looks up. Paul's in the doorway.    She gets up. Suddenly the light goes off. 
ANNA Paul. The light comes back on.   Paul stands by the light switch. 
ANNA What are you doing? 
PAUL (puts his finger to his lips) Ssh. Don't talk so loud. You'll wake the neighbors. 
Anna's getting nervous.    Something's not right. 
ANNA What neighbors? You don't have any neighbors. Suddenly he looks at her reproachfully. 
PAUL Did you ever love me Anna? CLOSE ON Anna's face.    She looks away guiltily. 
PAUL (O.C.) Did you? Anna closes her eyes.    Unable to answer. 
PAUL (O.C.) Say it.     Say you love me. Suddenly we hear the strident ringing of a phone. 
ANNA Aren't you going to pick it up? 
PAUL (O.C.) Me?   No.    It's probably for Eliot. Anna's eyes snap open in shock... 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Eliot stands over her. We're back in the PREP ROOM.   We hear the faint ringing of a phone from upstairs. 
ANNA Is it always like this? 
ELIOT What do you mean? 
ANNA I thought when you died you wouldn't feel anything. You wouldn't feel any more pain. You wouldn't have to struggle anymore. 
(BEAT) But it just doesn't stop does it? Upstairs the phone keeps on ringing. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER 
Eliot takes notes as he talks on the phone. He looks at a day calendar on his desk. Idly flips over the page from Tuesday to Wednesday. 
ELIOT No.   It's no problem at all. He glances at his watch. 
ELIOT I'll pick up the deceased from the hospital. Yes. This afternoon? That'll be fine. It's my pleasure Mr. Merano. 
INT. HOSPITAL MORGUE - DAY 
GRAY BODIES lie on steel tables. Eliot moves over to one of the CORPSES. Examines it with professional interest. Just then the Old Guy walks in with the Pale Assistant pushing a gurney with a BODY wrapped in plastic sheeting. 
OLD GUY Well here he is. Frank Merano. The Old Guy hands Eliot a clipboard. The Assistant unties the rope. Pulls the plastic sheeting away. 
ON BODY FRANK (40s), the top half of his head has been flattened. His head split open. Grotesquely distorting his face. 
ASSISTANT (O.C.) Ouch.   That had to hurt. 
MORGUE Eliot glances at the Assistant with disdain. Signs the release form and hands the clipboard back to the Old Guy. 
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. TEACHERS' COMMON ROOM - DAY 
Paul stands by a PRINCIPAL as they watch a JANITOR snap off the padlock on Anna's locker. 
PRINCIPAL 
TOM You didn't believe him did you? 
PAUL No.   Of course not. Tom's relieved. Paul turns back to the monitors.     The ghostly figure of a YOUNG FEMALE TEACHER drifts hypnotically across the screen. 
PAUL It's just... I'm having these... 
TOM What? 
PAUL Nothing.   Forget it. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - DAY 
Eliot leans over Frank's body on the slab. Rolling a ball of wax in his hands to warm it up. He gently moves Frank's head to one side. In the b.g. Anna lies on her slab watching Eliot work. 
ANNA'S POV Frank stares back at her with open dull eyes. His face partially reconstructed with plaster of Paris. 
PREP ROOM Eliot smooths the wax over the plaster to give Frank's face a more natural texture. Then picks up a piece of wire with a fishhook-like barb at each end. 
ANNA (O.C.) What's that for? Eliot looks up surprised. Anna stands beside him.        He leans down. Peels back Frank's upper lip. 
ELIOT His mouth.   To keep it closed. Eliot imbeds one barb into the upper gum then pries back Frank's lower lip. He attaches the other barb into the lower gum, then twists the wires tightly together. He picks up two plastic caps covered in small knobs. 
ELIOT Now his eyes. He inserts the caps into Frank's eyes. Pulls his eyelids over them. Glues the eyelids together. 
ANNA Is this how you'll prepare my body? Eliot looks at her for a moment.   Smiles reassuringly. 
ELIOT No. There's no need. I had to rebuild his face. You're still beautiful. 
ANNA Does he have family? 
ELIOT Yes.    A brother. He's coming in later. Anna touches the white sheet covering Frank's body. 
ANNA My mother... She didn't cry did she? When she came to see me? 
ELIOT (shakes his head) I'm sorry. 
ANNA And Paul? 
ELIOT It's not important anymore. 
ANNA I need to know. 
ELIOT 
(HESITATES) No.    He didn't cry. We see a brief flicker of pain in Anna's eyes. 
ANNA I knew he wouldn't.     He always got upset when I cried.     He said crying never helped. Anna suddenly looks very weary. She leans heavily against the slab. As if she's about to fall. 
ELIOT You should rest. He guides her back to the slab.    Helps her lie down. 
ELIOT You're getting weaker.    It's almost time. Eliot strokes her hair tenderly.    She looks up at him. 
ANNA Can I ask you something? 
ELIOT Yes.   Of course. 
ANNA Why do we die? A long beat. 
ELIOT To make life important. Anna's fingers curl around his hand. Like a vulnerable child. Totally trusting in him. Eliot looks down at Anna sadly. We sense he's conflicted. Confused. Wavering. But then reluctantly he reaches for a SYRINGE filled with AMBER LIQUID on the steel trolley. He injects her gently in the neck. Watches over her for a moment. Then moves to the window. He picks up a window pole. Pulls the shutter across the window plunging the room into darkness. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 
Eliot moves through the Funeral Home pulling heavy drapes over the windows and closing doors. It feels like a ritual. The once airy sunlit rooms are darker now. More ominous. Claustrophobic. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. ELIOT'S ROOM - DAY 
CLOSE ON a stream of crystal blue water.    We pull back. Eliot picks up a white towel. Dries his hands. Deep in thought. He moves to his desk. Picks up a Polaroid. 
ELIOT I'm glad I could help. 
VINCENT Do you mind if I have a couple of minutes alone with him? Eliot hesitates.      Then smiles. 
ELIOT No.   Not at all. I'll wait outside. As Eliot leaves, Vincent looks at Frank's body. After a moment he glances at Anna again. Then at the door. He quickly moves over to Anna. Looks at her curiously then pulls down the sheet. He reaches over... and CARESSES HER BREAST. Mesmerized by her naked body. As Vincent's hand moves down her body, he bumps against the trolley. Instruments CRASH to the floor. He pulls back the sheet just as Eliot enters the room. 
VINCENT I'm sorry.    I didn't see... 
Eliot notices the sheet covering Anna's body is slightly askew. He reaches over and straightens it. Then looks coldly at Vincent. There's an uncomfortable silence. 
VINCENT Well. I guess I should be off then. I'll see you at the service. Thanks again. Vincent glances one last time at Anna then leaves. The door locking shut behind him. Eliot stares at the door. 
ELIOT I just told you. That was your brother. (turns to Frank) You had an accident. You're dead. Why do you people never listen to me? Frank doesn't move.    His mouth still wired shut. 
ELIOT No.   It's not a gift.   It's a curse. Eliot picks up a compact. Roughly layers Frank's cheeks with thick rouge. With every word he gets more agitated. 
ELIOT I take care of each of you as if you were my children. I wash the shit from your bodies. I dress you. I do everything to make you look more beautiful than when you were alive. And what do you do? Eliot's extremely irritated now.     He grabs a garish red lipstick. Smears Frank's lips. 
ELIOT You argue with me. As if it were my fault you're dead. As if I was to blame. (slams down the lipstick.) What? You're not talking to me now? You don't want to? 
ON FRANK'S FACE The crudely drawn bright red lips.     Clown-like circles of rouge. Gaudy and macabre. 
ELIOT (O.S.) You don't talk because you have nothing to say. And you have nothing to say because you're a corpse. 
PREP ROOM From Eliot's reaction it seems as if Frank has started to talk again. 
ELIOT No. Now I don't want to talk to you anymore. 
INT. JACK'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The curtains are drawn. Jack's Mother, still motionless, in front of the blaring TV. Jack stops in the doorway. 
JACK I'm off to school now. His mother doesn't reply. Jack leaves. After a moment she slowly turns her head. Stares at the empty doorway. 
EXT. CEMETERY - LATER 
Jack cycles through the cemetery. He pulls up by a bush. Stares at the Funeral Home in the distance. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The service hasn't started yet. Jack walks nervously through the empty room to an open casket. He glances back, then leans over the coffin. 
JACK'S POV Frank Merano lies nestled in the velvet interior.    His face placid. No sign of the gaudy make-up. 
VIEWING ROOM Jack stares in fascination at Frank's body. He reaches into the casket. Touches Frank's cold hand. In the b.g. Eliot walks into the viewing room.     He stops surprised. Watches Jack intently. 
ON JACK 
JACK 
(TO FRANK) What's it like? Are you afraid? 
ELIOT (O.C.) Jack. 
VIEWING ROOM Jack turns quickly.    Eliot stands over him. 
ELIOT You have empathy with the dead. You're drawn to them. Just as they're drawn to you. It's a rare gift. Jack can't look Eliot in the eye. 
ELIOT I know you saw Anna. Jack hesitates.   Then nods his head. 
ELIOT You're frightened by it. I was scared too the first time. But you shouldn't be. Christ had the same gift. He raised Lazarus and spoke to the dead. 
JACK 
(INTRIGUED) You spoke to Miss Bryant? 
ELIOT Yes. 
TOM 
(IRRITATED) So?   That's standard procedure. 
PAUL There was no EEG. Nothing. He could have drugged her to make it look like she was dead. 
TOM Drugged her?     Are you serious? Jeff looks up eagerly from his desk. 
JEFF There are drugs like that chief. Hydronium Bromide. Total paralysis within seconds. The heartbeat slows to almost nothing. Tom shoots Jeff a look. 
PAUL See? I'm telling you. She's not dead. The boy at school. Jack. He saw her. 
VINCENT (O.C.) I saw her. Paul turns hopefully. Finally someone believes him. Vincent Merano stands by Jeff's desk. 
VINCENT She was on the slab.     Dead. 
PAUL No! 
VINCENT I've seen dead bodies.       Believe me, she was definitely dead. 
PAUL Tom. Just go down there and check the place out. 
TOM On what grounds Paul?       Do you have any evidence? 
PAUL No.     But-- 
TOM Do you have anything? Paul hesitates.    We sense his uncertainty. 
PAUL I think she called me. 
TOM Called you? 
PAUL 
(WEAKLY) On the telephone. Jeff snickers. Paul's beginning to realize how absurd this all sounds. 
VINCENT Collect or long distance? Jeff snorts with laughter. 
TOM First you hit a fucking kid. Then you attack Deane. And now you're telling me your dead girlfriend called you? What the fuck's going on? You're loosing it Paul. Merano and Jeff shake their heads, looking at Paul as if he were crazy. Tom's voice softens. 
TOM I know you feel guilty but you've got to pull yourself together. Paul slumps in the chair.       Rubs his face. 
PAUL Maybe you're right.    But why won't he let me see her? Tom signals to Merano and Jeff. Merano walks back to his desk. Jeff turns back to his work. 
TOM Look Paul. The funeral's tomorrow. You'll see her then. It'll help. It will give you closure. Trust me. 
EXT. CEMETERY - LATE AFTERNOON 
The sun's low on the horizon. Eliot whistles softly to himself as he digs a grave. Working meticulously. Like everything else he does. Suddenly a SHADOW falls over Eliot. He calmly looks up. The sun's behind the figure. For a moment Eliot can't tell who it is. 
JACK You said you could teach me. Eliot smiles. Gestures to Jack to come inside the grave. Jack steps back. The grave terrifies him. 
ELIOT It's only a hole in the ground.   I'm digging it for-- 
JACK Miss Bryant. 
ELIOT Exactly.   For Anna.   She belongs here. 
JACK Because she's dead. 
ELIOT No.   Because there's no life left in her. Jack carefully considers Eliot's words. 
ELIOT Don't you see? I have no choice. I'm the only one who can see all these corpses. Wandering the earth aimlessly. All they do is piss and shit. Suffocating us with their stench. Doing nothing with their lives. Taking the air away from those who actually want to live. I have to bury them all. I have no choice. 
(BEAT) Now there's two of us. 
Eliot holds up the shovel. Jack looks at him for a moment then reaches for the shovel. 
(QUIETLY) I wanted love. 
ELIOT You had love. Paul loved you. 
ANNA No. You don't understand. I was scared. I wanted to love but I didn't know how. I was... 
(BEAT) When I was a child... my mother. Anna struggles to pull together her thoughts. 
ANNA When I was a child. I learnt that love. That when you love someone. You get hurt. So I learned not to love. That way no one could ever hurt me again. She looks down at the slab.     Touches the cold marble. 
ANNA I was always pushing Paul away.      He thought I didn't love him. 
ELIOT Did you? 
ANNA He was the only one I ever loved. But I never told him that. And then he stopped loving me. Eliot stares at her intently.    Comes to a decision. 
ELIOT What would you do if you had another chance? Anna's puzzled. Eliot goes to the door and unlocks it. Moonlight floods in from upstairs. Washing it with a cold light. Anna doesn't move. 
ELIOT Well?   Isn't this what you wanted? Eliot holds out his hand.   Anna takes it hesitantly and rises from the slab. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT 
Mist drifts through the cemetery. Anna stands in the driveway. Pale and ghoulish in her black funeral dress and shiny black shoes. She starts walking. 
EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Anna approaches her mother's house.    Paul opens the door. He's not surprised to see her. Beatrice stands just behind him.     A black shawl over her head and arms. 
INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
In the candlelight we can see the house is full of OLD WOMEN. Their faces deeply lined. Wearing identical black shawls. They stare at Anna, whispering in different rhythms. Unintelligible words undulating like an ANCIENT PRAYER. 
INT. MOTHER'S HOUSE. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Paul and Beatrice lead Anna to the bed. As she lies down we realize the bed is full of BLACK SOIL. Clouds of ugly flies hang in the air. BUZZING noisily. The Old Women surround Anna in a tight circle. Leaning over her. Making her feel claustrophobic. She can smell their rotting breath as their prayers grow LOUDER. Through the chaos of words we begin to make out... 
OLD WOMEN Spit it out. Anna doesn't understand. Then she feels something in her mouth. Growing. Gagging her. The Women are SCREAMING. 
OLD WOMEN Spit it out. Anna spits out... white maggots.     She gags again.   Closes her eyes. Shakes her head. 
ANNA No. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. PREP ROOM - NIGHT 
Anna's eyes snap open. She's still in the Prep Room. She steps back from the doorway. Terrified. 
ELIOT I thought you were different. You all say you're scared of death. But the truth is you're more scared of life. Eliot switches off the lights. 
ANNA (O.C.) I'm glad I'm dead. I'm glad it's over. 
EXT. ROAD BY FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT 
Paul sits in his car. Staring out at the Funeral Home as he nervously smokes a cigarette. The light in Eliot's room goes off. Paul waits for a moment. Then gets out of his car. Stubs out his cigarette. 
EXT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER 
Paul treads carefully along the side of the Funeral Home. It's a full moon. The trees rustle ominously in the wind. Casting eerie shadows against the dark house. He finds a window. Tries to open it. It won't budge. Just then he hears a noise in the bushes. He crouches down quickly. Listens hard. Nothing. 
FROM THE BUSHES Someone watches Paul tentatively move to another window. 
FUNERAL HOME Paul strains to open the window when suddenly... he's caught in a circle of bright light. Paul turns quickly. A DARK FIGURE stands over him. Menacing. 
MAN'S VOICE What the fuck are you doing here? The Figure lowers the flashlight.   It's Tom. 
TOM I'm taking you home. 
EXT. JACK'S HOUSE. GARDEN - NIGHT 
ANNA You lied to me. Eliot injects her in the side of the neck. Anna tries to raise her hand to push him away but she's too weak. 
ELIOT (O.C.) You're still clutching onto life. Don't give in to your fears. You're so close. Anna's fading away.    Her hand drops limply to her side. 
ANNA 
(WHISPERS) Why did you lie to me? She stops struggling.    Stares blankly at us. Eliot looks at her for   a moment. Sadly. Regretfully. He picks up a Polaroid   camera. The flash explodes in a blinding white light.    He pulls out the Polaroid. Peels off the front and fans   it in the air. Then... 
ON ANNA ...delicately closes Anna's eyelids. 
ELIOT (O.C.) Good bye Anna. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON 
Anna's funeral is in progress.   Eliot stands by her casket. Surrounded by wreathes of tulips and lilies. Beatrice, in her wheelchair, in the front row. Diane beside her. A SCHOOLTEACHER sits behind them with Jack and other CHILDREN. 
FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.) I am the resurrection and the life. Those who believe in me, even though they die, will live. Tom and Paul appear at the door.   Tom guides Paul to a seat near the back. 
FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.) They that sleep in the earth will awake and shout for joy; and the earth will bring those long dead to birth again. 
ON CASKET Anna lies in an open casket. Her eyes closed.     She can hear the DISTORTED VOICE of the Priest. 
FATHER GRAHAM (O.C.) We have come here today to remember before God our sister Anna. To give thanks for her life. 
ON ANNA'S FACE We see an almost imperceptible frown. 
VIEWING ROOM Eliot gestures to Beatrice. Diane wheels her to the casket. Beatrice looks at Anna for a moment, then touches the violets in Anna's hands. 
DIANE Violets. They were her favorite flowers. (turns to Eliot) How did you know? 
ELIOT Violets just seemed appropriate somehow. 
Next we see Mrs. Hutton at the casket. Then Jack. He stares at Anna's body before being moved on by the Schoolteacher. Finally Paul and Tom approach the coffin. 
PAUL'S POV Anna looks serene. 
VIEWING ROOM Paul takes out the ring box from his pocket. Gently slides the engagement ring onto Anna's stiff finger. Suddenly he looks alarmed. Turns quickly to Tom. 
TOM 
(WHISPERS) What is it? 
PAUL She's so cold. Paul turns back to Anna.    Tears prick his eyes. He touches her cheek again.    Finally accepting her death. 
PAUL I'm sorry Anna. He kisses her lips. Eliot watches him carefully. It's almost as if he's jealous. Jack notices Eliot's look then turns and stares at Paul. As Paul and Tom walk away Eliot closes the casket. Begins to screw down the lid. 
INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME 
It's dark. We hear the screws TIGHTENING.      Anna's eyes FLICKER OPEN then close again. 
INT. FUNERAL HOME. VIEWING ROOM - SAME TIME 
Just then Paul turns back sharply.      As if he sensed Anna's reaction inside the casket.      Tom gently stops him. 
TOM (shakes his head) She's at peace now. Paul glances at the casket again, then reluctantly allows Tom to lead him away. Eliot tightens the last screw. His back to the room. Suddenly the screwdriver slips. Gashes his finger. 
ON COFFIN A drop of blood falls onto the polished wood. 
VIEWING ROOM Eliot stares at the blood for a moment. Takes out a pristine white handkerchief. Carefully wipes off the blood. Then places his hand on the coffin. 
ELIOT 
(SOFTLY) Don't be scared. It's better this way. Eliot turns.   Signals to the PALLBEARERS standing nearby. 
EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - LATE AFTERNOON 
The Pallbearers slowly lower Anna's casket into the open grave. The casket lurches as it settles in the grave. 
(AMUSED) Mr. Conran. We're at a wake.      You should show more respect. 
PAUL I know she wasn't dead. 
ELIOT Wasn't she? Eliot's suddenly tired of Paul's allegations. 
ELIOT Mr. Conran. You come to my Funeral Home, making wild accusations. You have no idea what happens when someone dies. What happens to their body. What happens to their soul. 
(TAUNTING) You think Anna was alive after the accident? Maybe you're right. Paul's stunned. 
ELIOT Maybe she's still alive. You obviously don't believe a word I say. So why don't you go and find out for yourself Mr. Conran. Find out whether she's alive or dead. Paul grabs Eliot by his lapels.   Shoves him against the wall. 
PAUL 
(LOUDLY) You twisted fuck. The room's SILENT. Everyone turns towards Paul.   Eliot whispers in Paul's ear. 
ELIOT You don't have much time left. Father Graham puts his hand on Paul's arm. 
FATHER GRAHAM Please.   Paul. You're not well. Paul pushes his hand away. Eliot shakes his head sadly. Everyone looks at Paul with pity as he runs out. 
EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Paul sprints across the lawn to his car. 
INT. PAUL'S CAR - NIGHT 
Paul slips his key into the ignition.   His hand's shaking. 
EXT. MOTHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Eliot watches Paul's car ROAR OFF. 
INT. INSIDE THE CASKET - SAME TIME 
We can't see a thing. But we can hear Anna's SHORT SHALLOW GASPS. And the sound of her nails desperately SCRATCHING at the coffin lid. 
INT/EXT. PAUL'S CAR. ROAD - NIGHT 
Paul drives fast. Accelerating then quickly braking as he weaves through heavy traffic. He comes up behind a slow Tractor-Trailer. Hits the HORN. 
PAUL Come on.   Come on. He swerves into the middle of the road. There's a blind curve ahead... suddenly an SUV comes out of the corner. A bright white light sweeps through his car.     Paul's momentarily blinded. 
THE SCREEN FLASHES TO WHITE. Paul opens his eyes. The ROAD'S EMPTY. No sign of any traffic. He's confused. The road was busy a moment ago. Just then flashing red and orange lights illuminate the car. Paul looks in his rear-view mirror. 
ON REARVIEW MIRROR An AMBULANCE moves quickly towards him.     Blasts past. 
CAR Paul looks through the front windshield.     Nothing.   He frowns. Where did the ambulance go? 
UP AHEAD We see the Funeral Home.   Bone white in the moonlight. The cemetery next to it. 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
Eliot's White Van sits by the side of the road. 
EXT. CEMETERY. PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Paul's car slams to a halt. He jumps out. In the distance the candles still burn on Anna's grave. 
EXT. CEMETERY. ANNA'S GRAVE - MOMENTS LATER 
Paul grabs a shovel by the grave. Starts digging. Then the shovel clunks against wood. He kneels down. Scrapes away the earth from the coffin. Then pulls open the lid. Anna's eyes are WIDE OPEN.     Her fingernails torn and bloody. Paul grabs her shoulders. Pulls her out of the grave.      Her body slumps limply like a rag doll. 
PAUL Anna.   I'm here. Please God.     Anna. He desperately tries to revive her. But there's no life left in her. He's about to give up when... Anna's hand TWITCHES. Then after a moment she GASPS. Her eyes slowly focus on Paul. 
ANNA Paul? 
PAUL Baby.   Thank God. Paul gently helps Anna to her feet.    She looks round. Dazed. Turns back to Paul.

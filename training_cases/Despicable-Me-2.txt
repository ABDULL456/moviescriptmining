DESPICABLE ME 2 
Written by 
Cinco Paul & Ken Daurio 
EXT: ARCTIC CIRCLE - DAY 
Snow and ice as far as the eye can see. What looks like a windowless MILITARY BASE surrounded by barbed wire fences sits in the middle of the wasteland. 
TITLE CARD: TOP SECRET RESEARCH LABORATORY.   ARCTIC CIRCLE. 
At the GUARD GATE, two RUSSIAN GUARDS play poker using an overturned barrel as a table. 
Russian Guard 1 shows a five of diamonds... and four Aces. The other Guard folds. Russian Guard 1 LAUGHS and drags in the pile of coins. 
While he SPEAKS IN RUSSIAN and does a celebratory dance, the coins fly up into the air. Russian Guard 1 stops dancing and sees that the coins are gone. He accuses the other Guard of stealing them. Russian Guard 2 swears he didn't take them. 
Russian Guard 1 grabs a shovel and wields it menacingly, until it flies up into the air. They both look up to see where it's gone. Then the metal barrel they were using as a table flies up, knocking them over. 
Russian Guard 2 looks up to see a GIGANTIC MAGNET SHIP LOWERING DOWN FROM ABOVE AND HOVERING OVER THE LABORATORY. 
A watchtower guard shouts. A door below opens as a bunch of Guards run out and point their guns at the magnet ship. Then...WOOSH! All of their guns are pulled up towards the ship, including the guards themselves, who are strapped to their guns. 
A SNOWMOBILE lifts off the ground and flies up to the magnet. Other vehicles and small buildings begin to pull away from the ground. 
Then-- 
THE ENTIRE LAB STARTS TO GET PULLED UP OUT OF THE GROUND. 
CLANK! The lab makes contact with the ship. It flies up and down, shaking the scientists and guards off. They fall to the ground. The magnet ship flies away with their lab, vehicles, and weapons. 
The remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the snow with the remnants of the damaged base. We see a porta- potty door open. A Confused Guard is sitting on the can reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident. He closes the door.

INT: AVL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
SECURITY FOOTAGE of the research station named PX LABS being carried away by the magnet ship plays on the screens at AVL Headquarters. 
We see the back of several heads watching the footage. 
There's a heavy sigh. 
SILAS Three weeks and we're still no closer to cracking this? 
No response. 
SILAS (CONT'D) Right... bring him in. 
LUCY (O.S.) Yes, sir. 
EXT: SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 
Gru steps toward camera, holding some sort of menacing gun, which he loads and cocks. He pulls the trigger, which shoots out an inflatable unicorn balloon. 
Smiling, he ties it to the windowsill next to some others. 
EXT: GRU'S BACKYARD - DAY 
A banner reads: "Happy Birthday Agnes!" and a massive backyard party is in full swing. The yard is decorated with pink balloons and streamers, and a BOUNCY HOUSE shaped like a castle. 
AGNES and several other LITTLE GIRLS slide down a slide. They are all dressed as princesses, but Agnes is dressed as a princess riding a unicorn. 
AGNES This is the best party EVER!!! 
Edith, dressed as a ninja, emerges from beneath a table and climbs across the monkey bars as a series of jousts, blades, and boxing gloves come up from the ground underneath her. She jumps down, narrowly avoiding a bear trap. 
EDITH Haha!   Yeah! DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       3. 
Two LITTLE GIRLS fish in a small kiddie pool. One of the girls pulls up a toy duck and then razzes the other girl, but then a LIVE PIRANHA jumps out and eats the toy duck. 
A BOY and a GIRL sword fight. The Boy does a bunch of fancy moves. The Girl waits for him to finish and then pounds him on the head with a club. 
Two kids in the background are on a see-saw made of bombs. Agnes runs into the middle of the yard and points offscreen. 
AGNES Oh no!   A dragon is approaching! 
Lucy sees this, drives forward, and opens the convertible top, causing the Minions to land right in the passenger's seat. They strike threatening karate poses. DESPICABLE ME 2                CINCO & KEN DRAFT   11. 
TOM AND STUART Hi-YAH!! 
Lucy tases them and they pass out.       She floors it. 
EXT: STREET - SAME 
Lucy's car continues driving until it reaches a crowded PIER. And doesn't stop. It drives right off the end of the pier. A confused fisherman leaps for his life. 
CONFUSED FISHERMAN What the--     Oh! 
SPLASH! 
INT: OCEAN - SAME 
Lucy's car now transforms into an UNDERWATER VEHICLE. As the minions come to, one of them tries playing with the radio until Lucy slaps his hand away. They speed through the sea and an octopus slams into her windshield. She turns on the wipers, which hits the octopus in the face until he's had enough and swims off in a cloud of ink. 
She HONKS her HORN as she passes through a school of fish. 
MINIONS Whoa... 
As the fish pass the Minions look ahead to see a shark heading for them with his mouth open. They SCREAM. Lucy quickly steers the car out of harm's way. They pass by several more sharks until they arrive at a GIANT SUBMARINE with the letters "AVL" on the side. 
A HATCH opens and Lucy's car goes inside.       The hatch closes behind her. 
INT: AVL SUB - SAME 
The water drains out from the holding dock. A buffer and hair dryer come out to dry off the car. A squeegee wipes off the windshield. 
Then the platform the car is on lowers down. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   12. 
INT: AVL ROOM - DAY 
Lucy's car lowers into the center of the room as a large circular table assembles around it, effectively locking them in. 
Lucy and the Minions get out of the car. She pushes a button on her remote and Gru, with a starfish attached to his head, is ejected from the trunk. 
GRU (groggily) Ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh, foot's asleep...ah...pins and needles... 
SILAS (O.S.) Good afternoon, Mr. Gru. 
GRU Ehhh... 
SILAS I apologize for our methods in getting you here. 
LUCY I don't. I'd do it again in a heartbeat. I am not gonna lie--I enjoyed that. Every second of it. Gave me a bit of a buzz, actually. 
SILAS That's enough, Agent Wilde. 
LUCY Sorry, sir. 
GRU Okay, this is bogus! 
Gru peels the starfish off his head and drops it onto Tom's. Stuart LAUGHS at him. 
GRU (CONT'D) I don't know who you people think you are, but-- 
A WAITER comes over with tea for Silas. 
SILAS We are the Anti-Villain League. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT   13. 
As Silas summons a map that shows all of the AVL offices around the world, Lucy's car drops out of the way. Stuart is trapped on the lowering platform and he scrambles to get back onto stable ground. Silas continues. 
SILAS (CONT'D) An ultra-secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale. Rob a bank? We're not interested. Kill someone? Not our deal. But you want to melt the polar ice caps? Or vaporize Mt. Fuji? Or even steal the moon? Then we notice. 
GRU First of all, you've got no proof that I did that. Second, after I did do that, I put it back! 
SILAS We're well aware of that, Mr. Gru. That's why we've brought you here. (beat) I am the League's director, Silas Ramsbottom. 
Upon hearing the name, Tom and Stuart start giggling. 
TOM Bottom. 
TOM AND STUART Heeheheeeeheeehee. 
Silas bristles at this, and glances over at Lucy. 
GRU (whispers) Hey, I told you guys to get to bed. 
MARGO Oh, sorry. 
EDITH So when ya goin' on your date? 
GRU What? 
EDITH Remember? Miss Jillian said she was arranging a date for you. 
GRU Yeah, well, she is a nutjob.    And I'm not going on any date. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    17. 
EDITH Why not?    Are you scared? 
Gru stares back at Edith.     Gets a far-away look in his eyes. 
EXT: PLAYGROUND - FLASHBACK - DAY 
We flash back to LITTLE GRU on the school playground. He stares, lovesick, at a CUTE LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, named LISA. 
LISA (to her friends) Hey, did you guys see the moon landing on TV? 
GIRLS Yeah, I can't believe it.     It's so cool... 
LISA Yeah, and you know what-- 
Gru approaches her. 
LITTLE GRU Excuse me, Lisa? 
But she doesn't notice him.    He tries again. 
LISA (to her friends) I was talking to Billy the other day. 
GIRLS No way. 
LISA He is so cute. 
Gru clears his throat. 
LISA (CONT'D) And I think he likes me. 
GRU Hey Lisa, I was wondering if you-- 
Gru reaches out and taps her shoulder with his pointer finger. 
Then one of the other little girls points to Gru's finger on Lisa's shoulder. DESPICABLE ME 2                 CINCO & KEN DRAFT   18. 
GIRL Ewww! Gru touched Lisa!         Gru touched Lisa! 
The other girls turn and squeal, horrified. 
GIRLS Eeeeewww! 
A little buck-toothed red-haired girl shouts out to the entire playground. 
RED HAIRED GIRL Lisa's got Grooties! 
The playground erupts with SCREAMS and everyone turns and runs away. 
Little Gru is left alone.     Crushed. 
INT: GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Gru comes out of the flashback. 
GRU Scared? Of what? Women?! No, that's bonkers! I just-- I have no interest in going on a date, that's all. Case closed. I'm not scared-- of women... or dates... let's go to bed. 
Gru gives each girl a goodnight kiss. 
GRU (CONT'D) Goodnight, Edith. 
Then he goes over to Margo, who's already in bed. 
GRU (CONT'D) Goodnight, Margo. 
She continues texting as he gives her a kiss. 
GRU What?   What's wrong? 
DR. NEFARIO (clears his throat) I miss being evil. Sinister plots, large-scale crimes...It's what I live for! I mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly? 
GRU Well, I'm also considering a line of jams... 
DR. NEFARIO Um...the thing is, Gru... (deep breath) I've had an offer of employment elsewhere. 
GRU Dr. Nefario! Come on, you're kidding, right? 
DR. NEFARIO It's a great opportunity for me, bigger lab, more evil, full dental... 
Dr. Nefario presses a button and his stuff folds itself up into a traveling suitcase. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     22. 
Dr. Nefario hangs his head.    Gru stares back at his old friend. 
GRU Very well. Let us give you the proper send-off. (calls off screen) Minions! 
INT: GRU'S LAB - LATER 
Seven minions are lined up with seven fart guns. Dr. Nefario sits in his scooter. 
GRU The highest honor awarded. To Dr. Nefario for your years of service. The twenty-one fart gun salute! 
FART!   FART!   FART! 
Dr. Nefario COUGHS.     His eyes are watering (and not only from the smell). 
DR. NEFARIO Uh, I counted twenty-two. 
Dave CHUCKLES, guilty.    Dr. Nefario fires up the scooter. 
DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) Farewell, my friends. 
The minions CRY. Dr. Nefario pushes another button on the scooter, transforming it into flying mode. He GUNS the engine and it begins flying away. At the slowest pace possible. Everyone just stands there awkwardly. 
DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) This may take a while. Go about your business. 
Everyone walks off. 
DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) I miss you already! 
Gru examines Lucy's business card.     Makes a decision. 
EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
The shadow of a mysterious figure approaches Gru's front door. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    23. 
EXT: GRU'S FOYER - NIGHT 
A Minion wears a French Maid's outfit and SINGS as he vacuums the floor. The doorbell rings. 
The Minion opens the door to see who it is. 
FRENCH MAID MINION Hello? 
A shadow falls across the terrified minion as something unseen abducts him. 
EXT: GRU'S FOYER - LATER 
The vacuum moves back and forth across the floor by itself. Another Minion walks by wearing a different Maid outfit. He doesn't see the other Minion and closes the door. 
Then he opens it again, cleans the doorknob, and closes it. 
INT: FAMILY ROOM - DAY 
It's morning at Gru's house. Margo and Agnes sit on the couch with a LAPTOP. Edith leans over the top of the couch, looking on. 
AGNES Are you sure we should be doing this? 
MARGO Yes, it's for his own good. 
On the screen is a DATING WEBSITE (CREATE-A-DATE.NET)--the girls are creating a profile for Gru. 
MARGO (CONT'D) Okay, we need to choose a picture. 
Margo clicks through pictures of Gru.    Each one is worse than the last. 
He flexes and makes it wave.     Gru hides his eyes. 
GRU Look away! 
Lucy stares at it. 
LUCY You-- Whoa... Hooo... 
EDUARDO Anyway, I have to go. It's all settled! I pick `em up next week! Have a good day. Come by if you get a chance, okay? 
He exits.    Gru GROANS, relieved.    Finally! 
Then Eduardo pops back in. 
EDUARDO (CONT'D) And welcome to the mall family! 
Gru studies Eduardo's face and GASPS. He pictures Eduardo in a red luchador mask surrounded by flames. Eduardo turns and leaves. As soon as the door closes-- 
GRU (whispers) El Macho. 
LUCY What? 
GRU But it couldn't be... DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT      32. 
LUCY Wha-- What? What couldn't be?? 
GRU That guy looks exactly like a villain named El Macho. From about twenty years ago. 
EXT: DESERT - DAY - FLASHBACK 
Classic Spaghetti western sepia-toned shot of El Macho looking menacing. He looks like the large Hispanic man from the mall, only younger and wearing a Lucha Libre outfit and mask (a mask which looks similar to the one Gru imagined). 
El Macho pushes the BARKEEP out of the way and grabs a large bottle from behind the bar. 
GRU (V.O.) He was ruthless. He was dangerous. And as the name implies, very macho. 
El Macho pours himself a shot and then smashes the bottle over his own head. 
He reaches down and pulls up a rattlesnake from below the bar. He squeezes its head, squirting venom into the shot glass. He drinks it down and then eats the glass. 
He sticks the snake's fangs into a few dollars that he leaves on the bar, before breaking through the wall behind him, leaving an EL Macho-shaped hole. 
EXT: STREET - DAY - FLASHBACK 
El Macho head butts an armored truck and approaches the passenger side window. 
GRU (V.O.) He had a reputation for pulling off heists using only his bare hands. 
When the ARMED GUARDS look over he punches through the bullet- proof glass, knocking them both out of the truck. Then he lifts the truck onto his back and runs down the street with it. 
GRU (V.O.) Ah, but sadly, like all the greats, El Macho was gone too soon. DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    33. 
EXT: SKY - DAY - PAST 
A bird, flying in the air, is suddenly struck by an airplane. 
GRU (V.O.) He died in the most macho way possible. 
El Macho leaps out of the plane riding a SHARK, a ton of DYNAMITE strapped to him. He plummets toward the mouth of an ACTIVE VOLCANO. 
GRU (V.O.) Riding a shark with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest into the mouth of an active volcano. 
He pulls two grenades from behind his back, yanks the pins, and holds onto them as he plunges into the volcano. 
There is a MASSIVE EXPLOSION. 
GRU (V.O.) It was glorious. 
INT: BAKE MY DAY - DAY 
Lucy stares at Gru, confused. 
LUCY Yeah, sounds like El Macho's pretty dead... 
GRU They never found the body. Oh no. All that was ever retrieved was a pile of singed chest hair. (beat) But... that face. It has got to be El Macho. 
Lucy gets an excited look on her face. 
MINIONS Hey! 
Pull back to reveal many minions singing and dancing. 
We move through the crowd, passing by the mace-wielding minion with his helmet still backwards and a smaller server minion with a tray of ice cream sundaes in mugs. 
We cut up to the rafters, where more minions are dancing and singing in formation, jumping and hopping all over the place in elaborate dance routines. 
Back on the floor, three arm-in-arm minions take the chorus. One of them clearly having had one too many sundaes is being held up by the other two. 
Another minion tries to carry empty mugs down a spiral staircase, but he's knocked off by a bunch of minions running up the other way. 
Several minions sit around a communal bowl of ice cream, lazily sipping at it through long straws. 
Gru enters and takes it all in. 
Other minions raid an ice cream cart, hanging from the canopy, drinking directly from the spouts. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT    37. 
GRU Alright, hey, hey--   No, no, no, no! Hey, please! 
The Minions stop singing. 
GRU (CONT'D) Kevin, Jerry, watch the girls for me, okay? (points) Dave, Stuart--come this way. With me! Come on! 
Dave downs a jar of maraschino cherries and sprays whip cream into his mouth before running after them, with a toothpick umbrella in his mouth for good measure. 
GRU (O.S.) (CONT'D) Come on! 
Once they are gone, the Minions go back to singing and laughing. 
INT: GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Margo, Edith and Agnes are fast asleep in their beds. Kevin and Jerry sing them a lullaby. Then smile and quietly close the door. 
INT: HALLWAY - SAME 
Kevin holds up a golf ball.   Jerry happily jumps up and down. 
KEVIN Hey, putt-putt? 
JERRY Oh! 
INT: LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Jerry puts the tee and ball in his mouth as Kevin stands on a dresser, preparing to take a swing. He asks Jerry if he's ready and Jerry gives a thumbs up. 
KEVIN Una, doo-- (laughs as he lowers the golf club to Jerry's head) DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     38. 
CRASH! CLANG! A noise comes from the backyard.      The minions exchange looks. What was that? 
EXT: BACKYARD - NIGHT 
Kevin and Jerry step out into the yard and look around nervously, armed only with the golf club and tee. 
KEVIN Boca! 
JERRY (scared) Boca! 
They walk over to the garbage cans. The cans begins to rattle. Kevin and Jerry SCREAM as a CAT pops up from one of the cans. The cat MEOWS. 
Kevin LAUGHS at him and imitates Jerry's scared face. 
KEVIN Looka too! 
Jerry slaps him.    Kevin slaps him back.   They start to slap fight until-- 
A SPOTLIGHT comes down from above, lighting up the terrified minions. Before they can scream... 
WOOSH! Jerry is sucked up into the air as if being abducted by aliens. Kevin grabs onto a flower, and then the cat to try and anchor himself down, but they both fly up into the air. 
The light goes out. A few seconds later the light comes back on and drops the cat back down. It turns off again and the Minions are gone. 
EXT: MALL - NIGHT 
The mall is dark and the parking lot is empty, except for two minions and Lucy's car. 
INT: MALL - SAME 
GRU (dazed) Ugh... 
LUCY What is wrong with that chicken? (beat) Hey, that pollo? Es loco. 
Gru is unimpressed. 
LUCY (CONT'D) (noticing Gru's wounds) No? Okay, let's go. 
INT: KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Gru and Lucy step into the kitchen. Lucy pulls out a HIGH- TECH SCANNING DEVICE and aims it around the kitchen. 
GRU You getting anything? 
LUCY No. Not yet. But hey, maybe you can find something with these x-ray goggles. 
Lucy produces a pair of HIGH TECH goggles.    Gru shakes his head. 
GRU (skeptically) Bah... 
Gru puts them on and looks around the kitchen.    We now see the room from his X-RAY POV. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   42. 
LUCY (O.S.) How're they working? Tell me, tell me! 
Gru turns to Lucy and sees her as a SKELETON. 
GRU Ahh!   Ooof! 
LUCY What's wrong? Something wrong? 
GRU Oh, that's an image I'll never get out of my brain. Blagh! 
Gru makes a face, disturbed. Then quickly turns away and spots something behind a painting on the wall...a safe. Sees something inside it--a METAL CANISTER. Smiles. 
GRU (CONT'D) I knew it! 
He goes to the wall and removes the painting, revealing the SAFE. 
GRU (CONT'D) The serum is in here! 
LUCY Ooh, then let's get it! 
He produces a SAFE-CRACKING DEVICE and places it over the combination wheel. Lights blink and it goes to work. 
GRU (gleefully giggling) Oh, this is going to be good! Ahh... 
CLICK. The safe opens, revealing--a JAR OF SALSA ("EDUARDO'S SECRET RECIPE"). 
GRU (CONT'D) A-ha! (registering it's not the serum) What? It's... salsa? 
LUCY (disappointed) Awww man. DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       43. 
INT: RESTAURANT - SAME 
Eduardo enters the restaurant.   Senses something isn't right. Frowns angrily. 
EDUARDO Oh... somebody's going to die tonight. 
He cautiously walks through the restaurant. Sees the chicken in the ball of cement. Gasps. 
EDUARDO (CONT'D) Pollito! 
Eduardo runs over to Pollito and picks him up. 
EDUARDO (CONT'D) What'd they do to you? Pollito? Can you hear me? 
POLLITO Boc! 
EDUARDO Who would do this to such a sweet little chicken? What? Who's there? 
His eyes darken. 
INT: KITCHEN - SAME 
Gru and Lucy, who are ravenously eating the delicious salsa with chips, turn to the door. Uh-oh. 
INT: RESTAURANT - SAME 
CRASH! Lucy's car plummets towards the ground. Gru SCREAMS hysterically, but Lucy just hits a button and the car TRANSFORMS into a jet. 
They fly off into the night sky. 
EXT: GRU'S NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING 
It's a beautiful morning. An ICE CREAM TRUCK makes its way down the street (playing the song the minions were singing earlier). It stops and a couple of CHILDREN run to meet it. 
Stuart opens Gru's front door, having heard the commotion. Two other minions approach as well. Stuart spots the ice cream truck and points to it, excited. 
STUART Oh!   Oh!   Gelato! 
And then suddenly a MOB OF MINIONS appears running for the ice cream truck alongside the group of children. The minions shove the children aside and clamor around the truck holding out their money. 
MINIONS Gelato!     Gelato! Gelato! 
Stuart pushes himself to the top of the unruly pack and tries to maintain order. 
STUART Stopa!    Stopa!! 
A hush comes over the minions. 
STUART (CONT'D) (knocking on the truck) Hey-ho! Gelato! 
Suddenly the ice cream cone on top of the truck transforms into a LARGE TUBE and extends itself above the minions. Stuart offers the tube a wad of cash and attempts to order gelato, but the it begins SUCKING the minions into it. ZUP! ZUP! ZUP! 
One by one the minions (dozens of them, including the minion with his head still trapped in the jelly jar) are sucked into the truck until there is only one left. He tries to make a break for it, but the truck lowers a popsicle in front of him. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      47. 
He licks it, his tongue sticks, and he is yanked back into the ice cream cone. The it closes and the truck drives away. 
The children look on puzzled. 
EXT: PARADISE MALL - DAY 
The hole that Lucy's car crashed through last night has been patched with plywood boards. 
INT: PARADISE MALL - DAY 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL that Gru is inside a GARBAGE CAN DISGUISE. Next to him is Lucy, also in a GARBAGE CAN DISGUISE, using binoculars. 
LUCY (O.S.) All right, there he is.   Suspect #8: Floyd Eaglesan. 
BINOCULARS POV 
Floyd Eaglesan attempts to entice a customer to visit his business, Eagle Hair Club. 
GRU Oh.    Okay. 
LUCY See if you can get closer. Go...go. 
Gru quickly stands up, revealing his legs, and takes several steps toward Eagle Hair Club. Floyd looks over his shoulder, and Gru stops. Floyd enters Eagle Hair Club and Gru inches closer. 
GRU Alright, what do-- 
BINOCULARS POV 
Suddenly a MAN approaches the trash can with a steaming cup of coffee. The binoculars readout says "WARNING! EXTREMELY HOT." 
GRU (CONT'D) (to himself) Oh no. That's not good. 
The man goes to throw the coffee in the trash and we see Gru's legs pop out from beneath the can. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      48. 
The man looks confused and tries again.     Gru dodges and takes off running. The man chases after him. 
Gru accidentally knocks into a bent-over woman's rear end. Insulted, she turns around, sees the man with the coffee, and slaps him across the face. Unfortunately, Gru doesn't see the escalator ahead and goes tumbling down the moving stairs. 
CRASH! BANG! CLANG! Finally, Gru pops out of the trash can and lands at the bottom of the escalator with a THUD! Flat on his face, he hears a familiar voice call out. 
AGNES (O.S.) Hey Gru! 
Gru looks up and sees Margo, Edith and Agnes. 
GRU Oh! Girls! What are you doing here? 
MARGO Well, we thought we'd come visit you at work. (looks at Gru and the trash can) So, you're saving the world in a garbage can? 
GRU (sarcastically) Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...funny. 
The music continues and Eduardo dances across the floor and out into the mall where he grabs a passing SHOPPER and pulls her into the restaurant. 
The confused woman holds on for the ride    as Eduardo twirls and dances her all around the floor. He     dips her and she melts, as do all of the women watching.     Eduardo gazes into the woman's eyes and produces a business    card. 
EDUARDO Kids eat free on Tuesdays. 
The woman grabs the business card from his hand with her teeth. 
Then Eduardo flings her across the floor and she twirls back out into the mall where she knocks over her confused husband. Then the song comes to an end and Eduardo strikes a final pose. 
Everyone in the studio cheers. 
GIRLS Yeah!   Wahoo! Cool!   Awesome! 
Everyone except Gru.   Eduardo walks over to him and gives him a big warm hug. 
EDUARDO So good to see you again, mi compadre! 
Gru tries to get out of the hug as quickly as he can. 
ANTONIO Oh, I see you have already met my father. 
GRU What the-- Father?! 
EDUARDO Si! Look at this crazy small world we live in, eh? Come, sit, let me get you something. 
Gru looks down and sees Eduardo's chicken glaring at him.    It SQUAWKS. It's unsettling. 
GRU Oh... look at you. 
Eduardo scoops the chicken up. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT     57. 
GRU (CONT'D) (nervous) Haha. He likes me! 
Gru tries to pet the chicken but Pollito lunges at him. 
EDUARDO Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Pollito is usually very friendly. (cradling Pollito) He had a rough night. 
The chicken stares relentlessly.   Gru CHUCKLES nervously. 
GRU Well, we really should be going. Girls, come on. 
Gru tries to gather the girls, but Eduardo stops him, pushing Antonio and Margo closer together. 
EDUARDO That is a pity. Young love is beautiful, no? 
GRU No! (chuckling nervously) You know, they're not in love. They hardly know each other! 
Eduardo suddenly lights up, having an idea. 
EDUARDO You are right, Cabeza de Huevo! They must get to know each other better. Antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our Cinco de Mayo party? 
GRU No, no, I am-- 
GIRLS Si! 
The girls are all thrilled at this, as is Antonio. As if on cue, MUSIC begins playing and they all begin dancing together. 
Antonio takes Margo's hand and twirls her across the floor. Gru stares at Antonio with a look that could kill. A waiter comes by to give Gru a party drink, and he promptly crushes the glass with his bare hands. His eye twitches. DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT   58. 
INT: AVL HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT 
Gru and Lucy sit across from Silas at headquarters. 
SILAS I'm sorry, El Macho? Hadn't we eliminated him as a suspect? After the whole salsa incident? 
GRU Yes, but there has been a new development, and I'm telling you, this is the guy. You need to arrest him immediately. And his deviously charming son. I'm pretty sure that the son is involved, too. The son also. You've got to get the son. 
Gru approaches Silas. 
GRU (CONT'D) (whispers) I think that the son is the mastermind. There's a look. There's a devilish look in his eyes and I don't like it! 
SILAS Yes, but I don't really see any evidence for-- 
GRU Evidence schmevidence! I go with my gut, and my gut tells me that this guy is El Macho! Lock him up! Lock up the son. Don't forget about the son. The kid gives me the creeps! 
Silas takes a deep breath and rubs his temples. 
GRU Agnes! Agnes!     Tell Jillian I'm not here! 
Agnes turns to the door. 
AGNES Gru's not here! 
JILLIAN Are you sure? 
AGNES Yes!   He just told me! 
Gru, panicking, shakes his head and wags his fingers. 
AGNES (CONT'D) I mean no, he didn't just tell me! 
JILLIAN (laughs) Agnes--where is Gru? 
Gru makes the "zip your lips" gesture. 
AGNES He's putting on lipstick! 
Gru waves his arms. 
AGNES (CONT'D) He's swatting at flies! DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     62. 
Gru waves his hand around his throat, making a "cut it off" gesture. 
AGNES (CONT'D) He's...chopping his head off! 
Gru clenches his fists and grunts in frustration. 
AGNES (CONT'D) He's...pooping? 
Outside, Jillian and Shannon look confused. 
JILLIAN (O.S.) I know you're in there, Gru! There's no way you're getting out of this! 
Kyle enters the room, carrying the bag with the wig in his mouth. 
EXT: RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Establishing. 
INT: RESTAURANT - SAME 
Shannon sits at a table talking to Gru, who's offscreen.    A waiter drops off a plate of spaghetti. 
SHANNON I have to tell you, I was so nervous about tonight. I mean there's just so many phonies out there! 
CUT TO Gru sitting across from her. Wearing a ridiculous WIG from Floyd. And looking extremely uncomfortable. 
GRU Yes, I hear you. (awkwardly laughs) 
SHANNON Oh, so do you work out? 
GRU Well... 
SHANNON I mean, obviously, you don't, but would you consider it? Huh? (MORE) DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    63. 
SHANNON (CONT'D) Physical fitness is very important to Shannon. As you can tell, right? Huh? 
Shannon drops to the floor and starts doing push-ups. 
GRU Ah.   I can tell. 
SHANNON (mid-push-up) Solid. 
She switches to one-armed push-ups. 
GRU We are in a restaurant, you know. 
Gru looks even more uncomfortable. 
Just then Lucy (unseen by Gru) enters the restaurant.     She approaches the HOSTESS. 
LUCY Hi.   Takeout for Lucy? 
HOSTESS Sure, just a sec. 
Gru and Lucy sit on the front steps of Shannon's house. 
LUCY Well, I think you did it. You just officially had the worst date ever. 
GRU Huh, tell me about it. 
LUCY Don't worry--it can only get better from here, right? But if it doesn't, you can always borrow my dart gun. I've had to use it on one or two dates myself. 
GRU Yeah, you know, as far as dates go, I think I'm good with just the one. 
Gru and Lucy exchange looks.   He CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY.   Time to go. 
LUCY Well, good night, partner. 
She pats his shoulder and walks toward her car.   Gru gets up to walk beside her. 
LUCY (CONT'D) This was fun. 
GRU Yes.   Surprisingly, it was. 
LUCY Oh, and uh, just between you and me? You look much better bald. DESPICABLE ME 2                CINCO & KEN DRAFT    67. 
They smile at each other, and she gives him a peck on the cheek and walks away. 
LUCY (CONT'D) See you tomorrow! 
Gru smiles a big smile. Shannon slumps over on the porch behind him. Could he be...falling in love? 
INT: GRU'S BEDROOM - SAME 
RIIIING! Gru's ALARM CLOCK goes off. He reaches out and turns it off. Ready to greet the day. 
INT: SHOWER - DAY 
Gru happily washes in the shower, acting out a puppet show with his rubber ducky. 
GRU Quack!     Quack!    Quack! 
INT: BATHROOM - DAY 
Gru brushes his teeth with two toothbrushes. He jokingly arranges them in his mouth like walrus tusks, then BARKS like a seal. 
INT: KITCHEN - DAY 
HEART-SHAPED PANCAKES are served to the girls sitting at the table. Edith makes a face at getting hers. 
AGNES Yeah! 
MARGO So I take it the date went well? 
GRU No!   It was horrible! 
He laughs gleefully.    The girls exchange looks.    What? 
Then he skips out of the room, dancing with a minion in the kitchen. Agnes's face lights up. Yes! DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    68. 
EXT: STREET - DAY 
Gru makes his way to work--on foot: 
--he strolls down the sidewalk. 
--he passes a MAILMAN and gives him a high five. 
GRU High-five! 
Then a POLICEMAN, with whom he exchanges mimed gunfire. 
Then a NUN, with whom he bumps rumps. 
GRU (CONT'D) Bump it. 
Seeing something offscreen, Gru GASPS. 
--he stops traffic so a happy family of DUCKS can cross the street. 
--he plays ultimate frisbee with a bunch of COLLEGE KIDS, balancing the spinning disc on his pointy nose. 
Gru walks back home, completely depressed. 
Walks past the college kids playing frisbee.      Catches the frisbee and tosses it down the sewer. 
Walks past the group of bucket drummers.    As he passes he KICKS one of the buckets. 
Walks past the old ladies doing Tai Chi. As they balance on one leg he pushes them all and they all fall over. 
EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's pouring rain.    Gru sits alone outside his house. Miserable. 
And then an UMBRELLA approaches him. It looks like it's traveling on its own. But when it gets closer it lifts up, revealing Agnes. 
AGNES I brought you an umbrella. 
Gru takes the umbrella and Agnes joins him.    They both huddle under it. 
GRU Ah, thank you. 
AGNES What're you doing out here? 
GRU Remember when you said that I liked Lucy? Well, it turns out...you're right. 
Agnes's face lights up. DESPICABLE ME 2               CINCO & KEN DRAFT   72. 
AGNES Really? 
GRU Yes, but...well, she's moving away. (sadly) I'm never going to see her again. 
Agnes's face falls. All her hopes and dreams shattered.     But she tries to encourage Gru. 
AGNES Is there anything I can do to help? 
GRU Oh, I don't--I don't think so, sweetheart. 
AGNES Well, is there anything you could do? 
Gru thinks. 
INT: GRU'S OFFICE - DAY 
Gru is on the PHONE. 
GRU "Hello, Lucy. This is Gru. I know up to this point our relationship has been strictly professional, and you're leaving for Australia and all, but..." (struggles to get it out) Okay, here is the question. "Would you like to--to go out on a date?" 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL Dave the minion standing across from Gru, pretending to be on a cell phone on the other end of the line. And wearing a RED-HAIRED WIG. He shrugs. 
DAVE Eh, no. 
GRU Okay, that's not helping. 
He hangs up. 
GRU (CONT'D) All right.     Here we go.   For real this time. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT      73. 
He stares at Lucy's card. Then turns to the phone. It's a stand-off. He does stretches and calisthenics to psych himself up. He SIGHS. 
GRU (CONT'D) I can do this. 
He stares down the phone again. It sits there, taunting him. We cut back and forth between Gru and the phone, until finally-- 
GRU (CONT'D) Agh!    I hate you! 
He produces a FLAMETHROWER and burns up the phone.    Dave dives out of the way. 
GRU (CONT'D) (satisfied) Ah. 
RIIIIIING !!!    The FIRE ALARM goes off. 
CHOP! Suddenly AXES chop through the wall. Several minions in FIREMEN'S GEAR enter.  Another minion imitates a siren through a bullhorn. 
SIREN MINION Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo! 
One continues chopping everything in sight with his axe, then chops his way right through the wall of the house and falls outside. Another minion brings in a MASSIVE HOSE, turns it on, and goes flying around the room as it whips around like a snake. Dave tests out a fire extinguisher. 
SIREN MINION (CONT'D) Beedo!    Beedo! Beedo! Beedo! 
GRU (CONT'D) Edith, try not to kill anyone. 
EDITH Hai! 
GRU Margo-- 
As Gru turns to Margo he sees that she is holding hands with Antonio, face-to-face, almost close enough to kiss. 
ANTONIO Hello, Mr. Gru. 
Gru furrows his brow. 
GRU Aghhh!    Okay... 
He grabs Antonio and drags him far away from Margo. 
MARGO Gru! 
GRU There must be the standard six feet of space between you and boys. (re: Antonio) Especially this boy. 
Gru turns and sees that Antonio is back next to Margo. 
ANTONIO (laughs) You are a funny man. There are no rules, Señor! It's Cinco De Mayo! (to girls) Come on! They're starting the dance! 
He grabs Margo's hand and takes off.    Edith and Agnes follow. Agnes explodes with delight. 
AGNES (rolling her r like crazy) Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrriba! 
Gru watches them go.    Frowns. DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT       77. 
EXT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER 
Gru, sneaking through the party, spots Antonio and Margo dancing. 
Gru sneaks up on Antonio, using the flashing strobe lights to cover his approach. Suddenly Antonio is gone and Gru is the one dancing with Margo, who has her back to him and is oblivious to what's going on. 
Antonio reappears and kicks Gru in the crotch from behind. He dances once again with Margo while Gru hunches over in pain. 
Gru then gets the upper hand and starts choking Antonio and shaking him. Margo turns around and sees this. 
Gru and Antonio see they are being watched by Margo and start casually dancing next to each other as if nothing is wrong. 
As the song ends, Margo takes Antonio's hand and pulls him away from Gru off the dance floor. 
Gru is defeated and all alone. 
INT: EDUARDO'S HOUSE - LATER 
Gru sits by himself in the corner, sulking and staring at Lucy's lipstick taser. A WAITER walks by and places a tortilla chip sombrero on his head with the rim filled with guacamole. He breaks off a piece, dips it, and eats it. 
EDUARDO (O.S.) So glad you could make it, mi compadre. 
Gru looks up and sees Eduardo standing there.   Gru quickly hides the taser. 
EDUARDO (CONT'D) (sensing something's wrong) Hey, what's wrong? 
GRU Oh, nothing. Nothing is wrong. I'm just chilling with the guac...from my chip hat. 
Gru takes another scoop of guacamole, smiles, and gives a thumbs up. A glob of guacamole falls from the sombrero. Eduardo puts his arm around him. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   78. 
EDUARDO Gru, please. I know that look all too well. It is the look of a broken heart. 
GRU How did you know? 
EDUARDO Believe me, my friend, I too have spent many nights trying to drown my sorrows in guacamole. 
GRU You? 
EL MACHO Yes. But we are survivors. There's much more to us than meets the eye. Enjoy the party. 
Eduardo gives Gru a meaningful look. And then walks away. Gru watches him go. Deep in thought. 
Gru notices Eduardo suspiciously sneak away from the party and head into the house. 
Gru gets up from the table and follows Eduardo. As he walks through the party, several partygoers break tortilla pieces off his sombrero to eat. 
INT: EDUARDO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
LUCY I choose Gru. (to everyone) I CHOOSE GRU! 
Lucy runs to the exit door and flings it open.   WOOSH!   Air rushes throughout the cabin. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Thank you, Gru stewardess! 
The flight attendant stands up, recovering from her twirl. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT You're welcome! 
The other passengers wave as the plane's oxygen masks fall from each overhead console. And with that, Lucy jumps from the plane, holding her purse. 
EXT: SKY - DAY 
As Lucy falls from the sky she presses a button on her purse and it transforms into a hanglider. She flies off with purpose. 
INT: TUNNEL - DAY 
Elevator doors open revealing EL MACHO'S UNDERGROUND LAIR. Gru stands in the doorway, pulling the dart out of his nose. The lair is a massive villainous complex that looks a lot like hell. Gru takes the place in. It's awesome and terrifying. The magnet ship is there! 
EDUARDO (O.S.) You have not lost your touch, my friend. 
Gru turns around and sees Eduardo dressed in El Macho's old wrestling outfit, like we saw in the flashback. 
GRU Ha ha!    I knew it!   You are El Macho! 
EL MACHO That's right! 
GRU Nobody believed me! Ho ho!     But I knew you weren't dead! DESPICABLE ME 2           CINCO & KEN DRAFT    82. 
EL MACHO (laughing) Of course not. I merely faked my death, ha, ha! (beat) But now it's time for me to make a spectacular return to evil! Doctor, I think it's time we showed Gru what we're up to here. 
Standing in the middle of the lair's walkway is the one, the only...Dr. Nefario. 
GRU Dr. Nefario? 
DR. NEFARIO Nice to see you, Gru. 
GRU Whaaat? This-- So, this is your new job opportunity? 
DR. NEFARIO Absolutely. You're gonna like this. 
Dr. Nefario pulls a lever. A platform rises with the Purple Minion version of Kevin strapped to a chair on it. 
EL MACHO Sorry--I had to borrow some of your minions, but it was for a worthy cause. 
GRU Oh!   Kevin? Agh! 
EL MACHO No, he's not Kevin anymore. Now he is an indestructible, mindless killing machine! 
KEVIN Blah! 
EL MACHO Just watch this! 
He then presses a BUTTON. 
--a machine gun lowers and the purple minion's RIDDLED with BULLETS, but unhurt. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT     83. 
--a FLAMETHROWER shoots fire at the purple minion, but he's completely unharmed. 
--an axe is swung at him, but he just eats it. 
--an atom bomb falls on him, but he just swallows it and it explodes harmlessly in his belly. 
--a POLICE CAR is dropped onto him, and he devours it whole. 
Gru stares, stunned. 
EL MACHO (CONT'D) And here's the best part! I've got an ARMY OF THEM! 
The lights come on above El Macho, revealing hundreds of caged PURPLE MINIONS. 
Gru can't believe his eyes.    El Macho LAUGHS. 
EL MACHO (CONT'D) Soon I will unleash them on the world--and if anyone, anyone, tries to stop them...YEOW! Their city gets eaten! (beat) We can do it together! 
GRU Together? 
She makes it through, but still no sign of Gru. 
Suddenly Pollito appears and exchanges looks with Lucy. He SCREECHES and flies towards her. She strikes a martial arts pose ready to defend herself. As she does, her purse falls to the ground. 
The attack never comes and she looks down to see Pollito pecking at her purse. 
EL MACHO (O.S.) Pollito!   What's the matter? 
El Macho appears and picks up the chicken, petting it. 
LUCY Oh, hey!   Eduardo! 
EL MACHO Lucia! I apologize. Pollito, he's usually not like this. The same thing happened the other day with... with Gru and... 
El Macho drops off, deep in thought.   Connecting the dots. Lucy is oblivious. 
LUCY Oh, speaking of Gru...uh, have you seen him? I really need to talk to him. 
EL MACHO Yes, I think he's somewhere around here. You two are close, no? 
LUCY Oh, I don't know. I mean close... I wouldn't say we were close. Why, did he say we were close? Did he say that? DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT      87. 
EL MACHO It's more what he didn't say. For instance, he never mentioned...that you were both working for the Anti- Villain League!!! 
Suddenly El Macho turns Pollito around revealing that he has her AVL credentials in his beak. El Macho grabs Lucy. 
EL MACHO (CONT'D) (threateningly) You're coming with me. 
He leads her away. 
LUCY Hey! 
We see Dr. Nefario watching this, in shock.      He's holding a drink and a Mexican flag cupcake. 
DR. NEFARIO Crikey. 
EXT: GRU'S HOUSE - DAY 
The vehicle pulls into the driveway. 
INT: GRU'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Gru walks the girls into the family room. Two minions sit in front of the big screen TV playing a video game. 
EDITH So Eduardo's actually El Macho? Cool! 
GRU No, it is not cool. Plus, I pretty much knew it was him all along, so if anyone's cool, it's me. 
The BIGSCREEN TV BEEPS. Gru and the others turn to look. It's Dr. Nefario. He's at El Macho's, whispering and looking anxiously around him from under a table. 
DR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN) (whispering) Gru! 
GRU Well, Dr. Nefario... DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    88. 
DR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN) (hurriedly) El Macho's on to you. He knows you're working for the AVL. And he's got your partner! 
Gru is confused. 
GRU Lucy? Wha--that's impossible! She's on her way to Australia... 
EL MACHO (O.S.) Nefario! 
Dr. Nefario looks nervously offscreen.    El Macho's coming. 
DR. NEFARIO (ON SCREEN) Sorry, gotta go! 
Nefario disconnects the camera.   The screen goes blank. 
Agnes GASPS and turns to Gru. 
AGNES He's got Lucy? 
GRU (determined) Not for long. 
Gru begins to walk out of the room.    He turns to the minions. 
GRU (CONT'D) Come on. (beat) We're getting her out of there. 
AGNES Whoa! 
It drops down into the lab and lands on a dazed yellow minion. The girls SCREAM as it jumps up and dashes towards them. 
Evil minion Kevin stomps toward the girls.    They are backed into a corner. It's all over. 
Then suddenly a HYPODERMIC NEEDLE enters frame and injects evil minion Kevin. He falls over, writhing on the floor. Then he sits up and-- 
Has turned back into a YELLOW MINION.    It's Kevin! 
KEVIN Ooh-la-la!     Pilatos? 
AGNES Kevin! 
The other minions dog pile on him with friendly hugs. 
MARGO Dr. Nefario! You're back! 
Reveal Dr. Nefario holding the needle. 
DR. NEFARIO In the flesh. 
Nefario produces a VIAL filled with YELLOW LIQUID. 
DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) Behold, the antidote! 
He walks over to a vat of the jelly. 
DR. NEFARIO (CONT'D) Come on. Let's finally put this horrible jelly to some good use. 
He pours the antidote into the vat. 
EXT: EL MACHO'S HOUSE - LATER 
Gru makes his way up the road leading to El Macho's house. He is wearing handcuffs, and being led at spear-point by Dave and Stuart, who have been painted purple to look like Evil minions. But they are goofing around and giggling. And they still have a few yellow spots. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT   92. 
GRU Hey, guys.     Come on!   Stay focused here! 
The minions somber up. 
MINIONS Okay, okay. 
Gru covers a smeared yellow spot with purple paint. 
They approach the front gate, which is closed. Dave boosts himself onto a stray box and speaks gibberish into the intercom. He hears Evil Minion gibberish in response. He responds back in Evil Minion gibberish. 
The intercom buzzes and the gate begins to open. 
The gate opens and there are DOZENS of PURPLE MINIONS milling about. They eye Gru and his captors suspiciously. 
Dave and Stuart poke Gru with a spear. 
GRU (attempting to act) Curses. Foiled again. These guys captured me. 
The Evil Minions CHEER at seeing this. 
Gru, Dave and Stuart have to walk all the way to the house surrounded on all sides by evil purple minions. The painted yellow minions are very nervous. The purple minions eye them as they pass. They GROWL and the yellow minions attempt to GROWL back. 
It's extremely intense, but it looks like they're going to make it. 
Then one of the evil minions makes a slobbery raspberry at one of the painted ones. They get into a raspberry fight until the painted minion is grossed out and tries to rub the slobber off him. It rubs off the purple paint. 
One of the evil purple minions points and SCREAMS. They're exposed! All of the purple minions run towards Gru, Dave and Stuart. Teeth bared. Ready to chomp. 
GRU (CONT'D) Run! 
They take off running. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      93. 
EXT: EL MACHO'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Gru and the yellow minions burst into El Macho's backyard. The Evil Minions give chase. 
GRU Up that tree! Hurry, hurry! 
They climb a tree up to the roof of the house, only to be pursued by more minions up there. And the Evil Minions have devoured the tree so they can't go back that way either. 
With no escape, Gru and the minions run up a tower until they reach the top--a dead end. 
El Macho stares down Gru.   Fire in his eyes. 
EL MACHO We could've ruled the world together, Gru. But now--you're gonna die. 
He pulls out a vial of PX-41 and drinks it. Gru GASPS. El Macho transforms into a giant, purple, furry creature. He ROARS. 
Gru pulls the trigger on his jelly gun, but he is out of ammunition. He then pulls out the FREEZE RAY and fires, encasing El Macho's fists in blocks of ice. El Macho GROWLS and slams his fists to the ground, shattering the ice and knocking Gru off the platform and onto a scaffolding. Gru SCREAMS. 
The scaffolding tips over. El Macho grabs the scaffolding and holds it above his head, ready to crush Gru. 
Suddenly Gru pulls out Lucy's lipstick taser and fires it at Purple El Macho! The jolt of electricity has him shaking and dancing and ultimately sizzling and smoking, until he finally collapses on the ground. 
GRU Lipstick taser! 
Lucy smiles at this. 
LUCY Aw...he copied me. 
Gru runs off to save her.   The minions surround El Macho, cocking their jelly guns. 
EL MACHO (dazed) I am not afraid of your jelly guns. 
DR. NEFARIO Oh, this ain't a jelly gun, sunshine. 
Dr. Nefario fires the Fart Gun directly into El Macho's face, causing him to pass out. The minions CHEER, firing their jelly guns into the air. DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT     97. 
One of the minions stands on top of El Macho and poses for a big game hunter-style photo. Dr. Nefario smiles for the camera as well. 
Gru runs toward the rocket. 
LUCY Don't worry about me, Gru! I'll be fine. I have survived lots worse than this. (beat) Okay, that's not entirely true. I'm actually kind of freaking out up here! 
GRU Don't worry--I will get you out of this! 
Gru attempts to untie Lucy. And then sees Pollito has walked over to the remote. Gru and Lucy GASP. The chicken looks at Gru and Lucy, then pecks the button. 
GRU (CONT'D) I really hate that chicken. 
The rocket blasts off into the air. The Minions and Girls watch in horror as Gru and Lucy fly off on the rocket. 
EXT: SKY - CONTINUOUS 
Gru uses his knife to cut Lucy's ropes. They SCREAM as the shark gets loose and falls down to a SUSHI BAR below where all of the CUSTOMERS and SUSHI CHEF CHEER. 
Meanwhile, on the rocket Gru rips a panel off the side, revealing a mess of WIRES inside. 
LUCY Is there a red one?   It's usually the red one. 
Gru starts to pull out wires left and right.   To no avail. 
LUCY (CONT'D) Gru, anytime now! 
Gru GASPS, realizing they are approaching the VOLCANO. Time is running out. Death is imminent. He looks Lucy in the eyes. DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    98. 
GRU Listen, Lucy--we may not get out of this alive, so I need to ask you a question. 
LUCY Uh, better make it quick! 
GRU If I'd asked you out on a date, what would you have said? 
LUCY Are you kidding me?!   Yes! 
Gru smiles. Then realizes that the rocket is still careening toward the volcano. He grabs Lucy. 
GRU JUMP!!! 
Gru and Lucy grab hands and leap off the rocket. 
The rocket plunges into the volcano. 
Gru and Lucy plummet through the air. 
KA-BLAAAAM!!! The volcano explodes in a massive tempest of fire and smoke and lava. 
The impact of the blast hits Gru and Lucy and sends them flying. 
SPLASH!   They hit the water.

NOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME "SCENE OMITTED" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. 
PROLOGUE:  INT. RIPLEY'S CABIN. EVENING. 
Fade up on Ripley, as in the final scene of the film, sitting, desolate in a ship's cabin. The camera rotates around his face, which begins in light and ends in darkness. 
RIPLEY (O/S) If I could just go back.  If I could rub everything out.  Starting with myself. Starting with borrowing a jacket. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST TERRACE. EARLY EVENING. 
Ripley is at the piano, accompanying FRAN, a young soprano. CREDITS begin. 
FRAN (SINGS) Ah, such fleeting paradise such innocent delight to love, be loved, a lullabye, then silence. 
The song finishes.  Applause.  They're the entertainment at a cocktail party to celebrate a silver wedding anniversary. Some partygoers congratulate Fran on her performance. A distinguished looking man, pushing his wife in a wheelchair, approaches Ripley, offers his hand. 
HERBERT GREENLEAF Most enjoyable. Herbert Greenleaf. 
RIPLEY Tom Ripley. Thank you, sir. 
HERBERT GREENLEAF (pointing at Ripley's borrowed jacket) I see you were at Princeton. Then you'll most likely know our son, Dick. Dickie Greenleaf... 
EMILY GREENLEAF We couldn't help noticing your jacket. 
HERBERT GREENLEAF Yes. 
EMILY GREENLEAF Class of '56? 
RIPLEY (hesitating) How is Dickie? 
INT. ELEVATOR OPENING OUT INTO LOBBY. EARLY EVENING. 
Fran, Ripley, Mr and Mrs Greenleaf and others emerge from an elevator. Emily talks to Fran, Herbert to Ripley. 
EMILY GREENLEAF (to Fran) I hope you'll come and see us... 
FRAN That's very kind. 
EMILY GREENLEAF Both of you... 
HERBERT GREENLEAF Of course, Dickie's idea of music is Jazz. He has a saxophone.  To my ear Jazz is just noise, just an insolent noise. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST. EARLY EVENING. 
Ripley shakes hands with Herbert Greenleaf as he gets into his Rolls Royce. They are making an appointment. Ripley crosses the street to Fran, pecks her cheek. She hands him his share of their fee. 
RIPLEY Gotta run. I'm so late. (he hands Fran's boyfriend the jacket he's been wearing) Thanks for the jacket. 
BOYFRIEND Sure.  Thanks for filling in for me. 
From Greenleaf's point of view he sees a couple embracing. 
EMILY GREENLEAF Darling couple, aren't they? 
DICKIE Who's this? 
RIPLEY It's Tom. Tom Ripley. We were at Princeton together. 
DICKIE Okay. (he sits up) And did we know each other? 
RIPLEY Well, I knew you, so I suppose you must have known me. 
DICKIE (to Marge) Princeton is like a fog, America's like a fog. (to Ripley) This is Marge Sherwood. Tom - sorry, what was it? 
RIPLEY Ripley. Hullo. How do you do. 
MARGE How do you do. 
DICKIE What are you doing in Mongi? 
RIPLEY Nothing. Nothing much. Passing through. 
DICKIE (finds this idea absurd) Passing through! You're so white. Did you ever see a guy so white, Marge?  Gray, actually. 
RIPLEY It's just an undercoat. (Marge laughs) 
DICKIE Say again? 
RIPLEY You know, a primer. 
DICKIE That's funny. 
He shares some intimacy with Marge, makes her laugh.  Ripley stands as they wrestle around him. Marge looks up. 
MARGE You should come and have lunch with us, before you go - Dickie? 
DICKIE Sure.  Any time. 
MARGE And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink. 
RIPLEY Thanks. Well, a coincidence. 
EXT. MONGIBELLO. EARLY MORNING. 
ANOTHER DAY.  Church Bells ringing. Dickie, dressed in shorts, comes bumping up the cobbled path towards the square on his MOTORSCOOTER. He stops by a steep flight of steps. RIPLEY, a book in hand, unseen, walking up a hill, catches all this and, intrigued, watches as a young Italian beauty, SILVANA, has a spikey, flirtatious exchange with Dickie, then climbs on the scooter, behind him. 
DICKIE I've been looking for you everywhere. 
SILVANA Ah, today you're looking for me.  And where have you been the rest of the week? Pig.  With your American girl?  I hate you, you know? 
DICKIE What? 
SILVANA I hate you. 
And RIPLEY watches them as they rattle down the hill towards the sea. 
EXT. MARGE'S HOUSE. AFTERNOON. 
Dickie appears in Marge's garden, the sea behind his head. Marge is sitting at her outside table surrounded by some of the remnants of lunch.  Dickie's sheepish, showered, late. 
DICKIE Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know, I'm late, I'm a swine. 
MARGE Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock. 
DICKIE I just woke up.  I'm sorry. 
MARGE You just woke up! 
RIPLEY Could you ever conceive of going there, Tom, and bringing him back? 
DICKIE What? 
RIPLEY I'd pay you. If you would go to Italy and persuade my son to come home. I'd pay you 
INT/EXT. MONGIBELLO CHURCH AND SQUARE. DUSK. 
A christening is over and now the whole village is pouring out of Church for the Passeggiata in Sunday best. Girls arm in arm parade. Boys arm in arm evaluate. New babies are compared and fussed over. Old people smoke, talk, shrug. Dickie is walking with Ripley, seething about his father's scheming. 
DICKIE I'm never going back. To actually hire somebody to come all the way here to drag me back home - got to be insane, hasn't he? 
SILVANA comes out of church arm in arm with a man, her fiancee, as part of a foursome which includes Dickie's pal FAUSTO. Silvana's eyes flick towards Dickie, otherwise there's no acknowledgement as they all greet each other. Dickie introduces Tom, then they move on. 
DICKIE (cont'd) I'm never going back! 
RIPLEY No, I think your mother, her illness - 
DICKIE It's got nothing to do with my mother! She's had leukemia for - ! This is what makes me boil about him! HE wants me back! - it's got nothing to do with my mother. 
RIPLEY I don't know, Dickie, I'm just telling you what I - 
DICKIE (interrupting) Go back!  Go back to New York or call him if you can find a telephone that works, and tell him wild horses wouldn't drag me back to him or his shipyard. 
EXT. DICKIE'S HOUSE, MONGIBELLO. AFTERNOON. 
Ripley appears, with his meagre luggage at Dickie's front door. He's carrying his tote bag under his arm, the bottom of which seems to be unstitched and held together only by his fingers. Marge is on the terrace, she looks down to see Tom talking with Dickie. 
MARGE Hi Tom. 
DICKIE (looks up) Marge, Ripley's saying goodbye. 
MARGE I'll come down. 
DICKIE (to Ripley) Did you speak to my father? 
RIPLEY You were right about the telephones. There are no lines, there's some problem. 
MARGE (coming out of the front door) Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans? 
RIPLEY Back, I suppose, slowly as I can. 
He goes to shake her hand and as he releases the tote bag the seam splits and records spill to the ground, scattering. He bends down, starts gathering them up. Marge helps. 
RIPLEY (cont'd) Oh, damn, sorry, this bag's - 
Dickie's delighted when he sees the Jazz titles. 
DICKIE You like jazz! 
RIPLEY (gathering up the records) I love jazz. 
DICKIE (holding up a Chet Baker) This is the best. Marge says she likes jazz, but she things Glenn Miller is jazz. 
MARGE I never said that! 
RIPLEY Bird. That's jazz. 
DICKIE Bird! Ask me the name of my sailboat - 
RIPLEY I don't know. What's the name of your sailboat? 
DICKIE Bird! 
DICKIE I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. (considering Ripley) What were you actually doing in New York? 
RIPLEY I played piano in a few places. 
DICKIE That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs. 
RIPLEY A few places - that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York. 
DICKIE The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating. (drinking) Cold beer. Thank you Dad. 
RIPLEY Copy out from here... 
He hands the book to Dickie, pointing out the lines. 
DICKIE (staring to write on the back of a postcard) I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes.  Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true? 
RIPLEY No! I've got more than one shirt! 
DICKIE She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient. (he's finished writing) 
RIPLEY Now your signature. (watching him write) Not "Dickie". Your signature. 
Dickie writes his signature at the bottom of the postcard. Ripley studies the writing, takes off his glasses to clean them. Dickie looks at him. 
DICKIE Without the glasses you're not even ugly. (takes them, tries them on) I don't need them because I never read. How do I look. 
RIPLEY Like Clark Kent. (takes them back, puts them on beaming at Dickie) Now Superman. 
Dickie cuffs him.  Ripley looks down at the postcard. 
DICKIE I know. I write like a child. 
RIPLEY Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? - fine, vulnerable - that's pain, that's secret pain. 
DICKIE It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it. 
RIPLEY Your handwriting - nothing more naked. See - nothing's quite touching the line - that's vanity. 
DICKIE (flattered) Well we certainly know that's true. 
INT. DICKIE'S BATHROOM. NIGHT. 
Dickie's in the bath. Ripley, dressed, sits on the stool next to the bath. They're in the middle of playing chess, the board propped on the bath tray. Ripley puts his hand in the water, checking the temperature. He turns on the faucet for a burst of hot. Ripley is absurdly happy. He pours some wine. 
DICKIE Do you have any brothers? 
RIPLEY No, no brothers, no sisters. 
DICKIE me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children - what does that mean? 
He looks at Ripley who looks at him, a little too long. 
RIPLEY Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in? 
DICKIE No! 
RIPLEY I didn't mean with you in it. 
DICKIE (standing) Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway. 
He gets out, walks past Ripley, who doesn't turn around. But Dickie's reflected in the mirror. Ripley looks, then Dickie turns, holds his look momentarily before flicking him with his towel. 
INT/EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, NAPLES. DAY. 
DICKIE I'll tell you - I am so cabin-crazy with Mongi. 
Freddie and Dickie link arms Italian-style and cross the street to Freddie's car. 
FREDDIE I know.  I was there. (looks back to see Ripley struggling to settle the check) Tommy!  It's S.R.O.  Two seater. Standing Room Only.  Chop, chop, Tommy! 
Ripley, abandoned, goes over. There's no room in the car. He has to crouch in the rear. 
FREDDIE (cont'd) You're going to have to sit between us. But don't put your shoes on the seat, know what I mean, put them one on top of the other.  Okay? 
INT. A JAZZ RECORD STORE. LATE AFTERNOON. 
This record store is hidden away down a cobbled alley, and stuffed with the trendiest Romans, all of whom rifle the stacks under a fog of cigarette smoke.  There are two LISTENING BOOTHS, one of which has Freddie and Dickie crammed into it, sharing a set of headphones.  Ripley stands outside the booth, holding both of their jackets like a manservant, while inside and behind the glass doors they chat animatedly. He looks longingly at the street, where the light is fading. Dickie catches his hangdog expression and pushes open the accordion doors. 
DICKIE Look, Tom, we've got to go to a club and meet some friends of Freddie's. The best thing is - if you want to be a tourist - grab a cab and we can meet up at the railway station. 
RIPLEY (absolutely crestfallen) What club? 
DICKIE Freddie's arranged it with some of the skiing crowd. Come if you want but I thought you wanted to see the Forum...? 
RIPLEY I did. And then maybe get the jacket and what have you... 
FREDDIE (from inside the booth) Dick - you've got to hear this! 
DICKIE (oblivious to Ripley's pain) Listen, just take one of mine when we get back. Don't worry about it.  I did the Forum with Marge and, frankly, once is enough in anyone's life. 
Ripley hands him the coats, turns away. 
DICKIE Ciao.  Have fun. 
Ripley heads for the door, then comes back, raps on the booth.  Dickie pushes it open. 
RIPLEY You said to make sure you didn't miss the train. It leaves at eight. 
EXT. THE CAPITOL. LATE AFTERNOON. 
Ripley hikes up Michelangelo's Arcoeli Steps. Then he's looking down from the Campodoglio at the Forum below. Then he's walking by the oversized fragments of the Colossus. This is the real Ripley, the lover of beauty, inspired by art, by antiquity. He's awed. He's cold. He so much wishes he weren't alone. 
INT. ROME RAILWAY STATION. NIGHT. 
It's past eight, Ripley stands, one foot on the guard step of the Naples train, waiting forlornly for Dickie, then giving up as the train pulls away. He pulls the door to his compartment closed, and sits inside the train alone. 
INT. DICKIE'S BEDROOM. NIGHT. 
There's music playing, Bing Crosby's "May I". Very loud. Ripley dances to the mirror, SPECTACLES ABANDONED and DRESSED AS DICKIE IN HIS TUXEDO, MINUS TROUSERS. He adjusts his hair, catches one of Dickie's expressions.  There are clothes abandoned everywhere.  He's been having a big dressing-up session. He sings along with Bing. 
DICKIE (O/S) What are you doing? 
Ripley turns, horrified, to see Dickie standing in the doorway.  The music thumps away. 
RIPLEY Oh - just amusing myself.  Sorry, Dickie. (pause) I didn't think you were coming back. 
Dickie turns off the record player. 
DICKIE I wish you'd get out of my clothes. 
Ripley starts undressing, his fingers clumsy with mortification and shock.  Dickie looks at his feet, shakes his head. 
DICKIE (cont'd) Shoes too? 
RIPLEY (lame, ashamed) You said I could pick out a jacket and I just... Sorry. 
DICKIE Get undressed in your own room, would you? 
Marge, still in her bikini, disappears into the cabin. Dickie makes a face at Freddie. 
DICKIE Do you think you can steer this thing? 
FREDDIE Sure. 
DICKIE Just point her at Capri and avoid the rocks. 
FREDDIE What are you doing? 
DICKIE Marge-maintenance. 
FREDDIE Aye, aye. 
Dickie heads towards the cabin. Freddie takes over the tiller. There's a breeze and the sailboat cuts through the water. 
From where Ripley sits he can see Capri in the distance, but he can also look down into the cabin, its porthole offering him a restricted view.  He looks down and there's a flash of flesh, then nothing.  Then as the boat swings with the waves, he glimpses the bikini top flung over a chair, and then Marge's bare foot kicking out rhythmically, the red-painted toes straining.  Ripley's mesmerized, aroused, and absolutely betrayed. 
FREDDIE (cont'd) Tommy - How's the peeping? Come on Tommy, you were looking.  Tommy Tommy Tommy. 
Shamed, Ripley looks away. He stares at the water, parting before the boat, its turmoil reflecting his. 
EXT. DICKIE'S MOORING. DAY. 
The Bird returns to the mooring by Dickie's House.  Dickie as ever Captain of the Ship, clambering around, shouting instructions, with Ripley, Marge and Freddie as crew.  Ripley looks back at shore. Silvana stands watching, staring. Dickie notices her too. 
EXT. MONGIBELLO SLIPWAY. LATE DAY. 
A WOMAN'S HEAD suddenly breaks the surface of the water. 
It's a statue of the Virgin Mary, life size, adorned with flowers and a lace veil.  As she is revealed, wooden, staring, four men emerge, lifting the statue on a palette, wading towards the shore, the Madonna aloft on their shoulders. 
The whole town of Mongibello is in attendance for this Annual Festival of the Madonna del Mare, either standing in their fishing boats, or on shore and flanking the Parish Priest and altar boys and incense. RIPLEY, DICKIE and MARGE watch from Dickie's terrace. There are hymns and, as the statue is carried to the shore, the men's heads barely above the waves, the congregation applauds at the illusion that the Madonna is walking on water. 
Suddenly ANOTHER HEAD appears on the surface of the water, about fifty yards from the statue. There's a scream from among the crowd as someone notices the body. It's SILVANA. One of the MEN carrying the statue turns first towards the direction of the scream and then towards the floating corpse. It's Silvana's fiancee, and in a second he has let go of the palette, CAUSING IT TO TOPPLE, and - in absolute grief - wades, swims, splashes towards the body. 
PANDEMONIUM in the crowd, which breaks up, with other people splashing, fully clothed, into the water. From the terrace, Ripley turns and looks at Dickie, catching his eye. 
EXT. DICKIE'S TERRACE. LATE DAY. 
Marge and Ripley and Dickie watch from the terrace as below them an AMBULANCE takes away the body. It seems as if the whole town looks on - fiancee, parents, brothers, sisters, police, priest, etc. As the corpse is loaded into the vehicle A BRIEF SCUFFLE occurs between Silvana's fiancee and her brother. They are pulled apart. Then the ambulance pulls away. 
RIPLEY What's the fight about? That's her fiancÈ, isn't it?  Are they blaming him? 
DICKIE (sharp) I don't know! Why are you asking me? (agitated) How can it take an hour to find an ambulance? 
MARGE (conciliatory) Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose - 
DICKIE I don't know why people say this country's civilised. It isn't. It's fucking primitive. 
And with that HE KICKS OUT VIOLENTLY AT A CHAIR SUPPORTING THE RECORDPLAYER. Records, machine, chair go flying across the terrace. Dickie storms inside. 
MARGE Dickie! 
RIPLEY I'll go and see what's the matter. 
MARGE I'll go. 
INT. DICKIE'S HOUSE. LATE AFTERNOON. 
Later, Dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window overlooking the slipway. He's playing sax. A forlorn, keening phrase from YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT LOVE IS. Ripley appears, begins tidying the mess in the living room.  He picks up empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top. 
RIPLEY I know why you're upset. (Dickie continues playing) I know about Silvana, Dickie. About you and Silvana. 
RIPLEY I've got plans! 
DICKIE Ripley's plans. 
RIPLEY Esatto. I'm always planning. 
DICKIE Did I know you at Princeton, Tom? I didn't, did I? 
RIPLEY Why are you asking all of a sudden? 
DICKIE No reason. Because you're leaving, I guess. I don't think you were there, were you? 
RIPLEY Why? 
DICKIE I mean it as a compliment. You've got such great taste, I don't know. Most of the thugs at Princeton had tasted everything and had no taste. Used to say, the cream of America: rich and thick. Freddie's the perfect example. 
RIPLEY Then I'll take it as a compliment. 
DICKIE I knew it! I had a bet with Marge! 
RIPLEY (a beat) Ha. 
DICKIE Do you even like jazz - or was that something for my benefit? 
RIPLEY (conceding, without guile) I've gotten to like it. I've gotten to like everything about the way you live. It's one big love affair. If you knew my life back home in New York... 
Dickie's distracted by the drummer who's playing an extrovert solo, doesn't hear the confession of love. 
DICKIE I'm thinking of giving up the sax, what do you think about drums? 
RIPLEY What? 
DICKIE So cool. 
He mimes a high-hat and snare. Ripley can't quite credit this - it's superficiality. 
EXT. MID OCEAN. DAY. 
The bay of San Remo. DICKIE and RIPLEY have hired a motor boat. 
DICKIE That's how I found my place in Mongi. Took a boat out round the bay.  The first place I liked, I got it. 
The motor boat is ploughing the waves. Dickie exhilarated by the speed. 
RIPLEY Dickie, slow down, come on! 
Ripley grips the oar, his knuckles white. Dickie cuts the motor, and the boat slows to a crawl, miles from the shore. 
DICKIE (ecstatic) I love it here! Gonna live here! 
Dickie takes off his jacket, then drums against the edge of the boat, developing a rhythm with his lighter and fingers, already on the way to becoming Buddy Rich. 
RIPLEY I wanted to tell you my plan. 
DICKIE So tell me. 
RIPLEY I thought I might come back. In the New Year. Under my own steam. 
DICKIE (suddenly tight) Really?  To Italy? 
RIPLEY Of course. Let's say, for argument's sake, you were here - perhaps we could split the rent on a house - I'll get a job - or, better still, I could get a place in Rome and when we're there we could be there and if we're here we could be here - 
DICKIE Oh God, I don't think so. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY. EARLY EVENING. 
Ripley approaches the front desk.  He's shivering.  He's not wearing his glasses. 
RIPLEY Can I have my key, please? 
RECEPTIONIST (at the key rack) Of course - But you must be very cold? Signor Greenleaf?  Yes? - 
RIPLEY (mind racing) No, it's - I'm... 
EXT. ROAD BETWEEN NAPLES AND MONGIBELLO. DAY. 
Ripley sits on the bus as it rumbles towards Mongi.  He stares out of the window, full of what he's done. No idea what to do. 
EXT. MONGIBELLO, FISHERMAN'S WHARF. DAY. 
The BUS comes into town. Ripley gets out, looks calm, very together. 
INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM, MONGIBELLO. DAY. 
Ripley walks into the living room, slowly approaches Dickie's saxophone which is on its stand on the table.  He can't get close to it, it evokes Dickie too much. 
INT. DICKIE'S LIVING ROOM. DAY. 
Ripley has Dickie's Hermes Baby typewriter on the desk and is busy writing letters. He has finished a letter to the Greenleafs, now he's at the end of one to Marge. We can read part of it - C/O American Express, Rome 9 November 1958. Dear Marge, this is a difficult letter for me to write... Ripley produces the Shakespeare and Signature page and COPIES DICKIE'S SIGNATURE at the end of the letter. 
EXT. MARGE'S GARDEN, MONGIBELLO. DAY. 
Ripley stands at the entrance to Marge's garden where she is working at her book on the outside table, surrounded by references and notes, held down by bricks. He looks at her until she looks at him. She's startled, gasps. 
RIPLEY Hello Marge. 
MARGE Tom, you startled me!  You're back. 
RIPLEY How are you? Sorry. Is your book going well? 
MARGE Yes - I'm on a good streak, thanks. 
RIPLEY I was just looking at you - (looking at her tenderly) - so quiet. 
MARGE Where's Dickie? 
RIPLEY I think he's planning on staying in Rome for a few days. 
MARGE (looks at him) Ha. Did he say why? 
RIPLEY I don't know. I don't understand Dickie, Marge, so your guess is as good as mine. 
MARGE What does that mean? 
RIPLEY Well, one day I'm invited skiing, the next day I'm not, one day we're all one family, the next day he wants to be alone. You tell me. 
MARGE Is that what he said - he wanted to be alone? 
RIPLEY He was thinking of you, Marge - he asked me to deliver this. 
He hands her a package. She pulls at it, it's perfume. 
MARGE Thanks. he knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited... 
RIPLEY Errand number one - deliver Marge's perfume. Errand number two, pack some clothes and his precious saxophone. 
MARGE (alarmed) How long's he staying for? 
MEREDITH (entering the shop) Dickie! Oh my God!  Ciao. 
EXT. ACROSS PIAZZA NAVONA TO ARCARI'S CAFE. DAY. 
Ripley and Meredith walk across the Piazza towards the cafe. 
MEREDITH But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you? 
RIPLEY What? 
MEREDITH At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and - 
RIPLEY (interrupting, astonished) How did you know that? 
MEREDITH Everybody knows Freddie Miles. 
RIPLEY (unsettled) Is Freddie in Rome? 
MEREDITH Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R. 
RIPLEY I've left Marge, Meredith. And Mongi. So the rat's here now, in Rome. 
MEREDITH Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if - 
RIPLEY Don't be sorry. I've never been happier. I feel like I've been handed a new life. 
EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY. 
Meredith and Ripley walk down the Spanish Steps and head inside the office. 
MEREDITH The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do - agreed? - you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it. 
RIPLEY I know. 
MEREDITH I've never admitted that to anyone. 
INT. AMERICAN EXPRESS OFFICE, ROME. DAY. 
Ripley's signing Dickie's allowance receipt. Meredith is with him, signing her own counterfoil. He is, of course, endorsed by her presence.  She goes to the window ahead of him. 
She takes her money, turns to him. 
He hands over his documents. The Clerk compares Ripley's signature with the one on the passport and then looks up at him. Ripley is cool as a cucumber. 
RIPLEY I don't want too many large bills. Nobody will change them. 
INT. RIPLEY'S SUITE, GRAND. ANOTHER DAY. 
Where A TAILOR is finishing the fitting of a cashmere jacket for Ripley. Bolts of cloth everywhere as Meredith adjudicates the possible materials, which the tailor holds up against Ripley. 
MEREDITH Show me the other one again. (the Tailor obliges) I like them both. 
RIPLEY I'll take them both. 
Ripley goes inside the bedroom to change. While he's inside, Meredith shows the Tailor out.  As she returns she notices the open sax case, peers inside. 
MEREDITH (O/S) I know you're a jazz fiend but do you absolutely hate the Opera?  I've been trying to give my tickets away, it's tomorrow, but if you were prepared to be dragged... 
She looks up to catch him bare-chested. She's intoxicated by him, the romance she feels to be in the air. 
RIPLEY (emerging) You could drag me. 
INT. THE OPERA HOUSE, ROME. 
MARGE I don't know her. (to Ripley) He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people. 
The last INTERVAL BELL. There's a mini-stampede to return. 
PETER Will we see you later? 
RIPLEY I can't later. 
PETER And tomorrow? 
RIPLEY Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna? 
PETER I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time? 
RIPLEY Ten thirty? 
PETER We'll be there. 
RIPLEY Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow. (to Peter) It's really good to meet you. 
INT. BOX, OPERA HOUSE. NIGHT. 
Ripley goes straight to Meredith and grabs her. 
RIPLEY Let's go. 
MEREDITH I thought you were enjoying yourself? 
RIPLEY Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon. 
MEREDITH You're crazy! It's freezing out there. 
He's looking past her, where a mirror reflects Marge wading through the audience, Peter's elegant head getting dangerously near as they approach their seats. 
RIPLEY C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us. 
MEREDITH (quite taken) Okay then, you're crazy. 
EXT. CAROZZA, ROME. NIGHT. 
Meredith shivers in the raw night as they cross the Tiber. Ripley as Dickie is confessing his heart belongs to Marge. 
MEREDITH Don't worry. Really. Don't worry. 
RIPLEY You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now - I look at you and I see her face - and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you - I just can't... 
MEREDITH No, I absolutely understand. Of course. 
RIPLEY Otherwise you'd be fighting me off. 
MEREDITH Beating you away. 
EXT. MEREDITH'S APARTMENT, ROME. 
They arrive at the courtyard outside Meredith's Apartment Building. Ripley jumps down, collects her. She makes to go inside, then looks at him. 
MEREDITH Will you meet me tomorrow?  Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too...you should always save pain for daylight... 
RIPLEY Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's. 
MEREDITH (fluttering) I don't - is that by the Spanish Steps? 
RIPLEY Exactly. 10.30 - (instantly correcting himself) 
ROVERINI Dickie Greenleaf? 
RIPLEY Yes? 
ROVERINI Inspector Roverini. Can we come in? 
INT. RIPLEY'S APARTMENT. EVENING. 
Ripley sits with his head in his hands at the table. Roverini and his sergeant, BAGGIO, watch patiently. 
ROVERINI It's a terrible shock, eh? What time did Signor Miles leave yesterday? 
RIPLEY I can't be absolutely sure - 8? 9? We'd both taken on far too many drinks - but it was dark, it was certainly dark when I walked him down to his car. 
ROVERINI So Signor Miles drove away and you did what? 
RIPLEY I went to bed. Freddie's a big man, but I'm in trouble after a couple of drinks. I've suffered all day. Who found him? 
Roverini has walked over to the bust of Hadrian. 
ROVERINI Senta.  We have to ask you to stay in Rome. 
RIPLEY Yes, if it's going to help, certainly. 
ROVERINI So, the Doctor, he has to make the - (looks at Baggio) - come se dice? 
RIPLEY Postmortem? 
ROVERINI Yes, exactly, but his first, his first conclusion was that Signor Miles was killed not later than seven o'clock yesterday evening. 
RIPLEY Well, he certainly wasn't dead when he drove off in his car. 
ROVERINI No. 
EXT. NARROW STREET, THE GHETTO, ROME. MORNING. 
Ripley comes through a dark tunnel in the Ghetto on his scooter. He drives past a furniture store, DRESSING TABLES AND MIRRORS spilling out onto the street. He glances sideways, sees his reflection fractured into several images and, for an instant, it seems AS IF DICKIE'S THERE WATCHING HIM. Ripley screams and swerves, crashing into the pavement, the scooter falling onto him and pulling him along the cobbled passage. The man he thought to be Dickie, an Italian, runs up concerned. 
EXT. AMERICAN EXPRESS, PIAZZA DI SPAGNA. DAY. 
Ripley emerges from the American Express Office. Across the street at the cafe, as once before, sits Marge. Ripley slips Dickie's bag into his knapsack as he approaches his scooter. Marge spots him and strides across the piazza. She is in no mood for pleasantries. 
MARGE Did he kill Freddie? 
RIPLEY Marge, when did you get here? 
MARGE Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie? 
RIPLEY I'd swear he didn't. Of course he didn't. 
MARGE I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. 
(focusing on Ripley's cuts and bruises) What happened to your face? 
RIPLEY Dickie did it. 
MARGE (suddenly tense) Dickie? 
RIPLEY My face! There was an argument. I said some things I shouldn't have.  About you. About the appalling way he's treating you, all of us.  And the next thing I know he's launched himself at me. (he pulls the scooter off the stand) Are you getting on? 
MARGE What? 
RIPLEY Get on. I'll take you to him. 
ROVERINI November 7th is my information. 
RIPLEY I don't remember the exact date. 
ROVERINI And when did you last see Signor Ripley? 
RIPLEY A few days ago. 
ROVERINI Does he stay with you here? 
RIPLEY No! 
ROVERINI No.  Here is a pattern. Two days ago Freddie Miles is dead - he leaves your apartment and is murdered. Yesterday a little boat is found in San Remo full of rocks, and the owner tells the Police it was stolen on November 7th. We look at hotel records and we see oh! Dickie Greenleaf is staying in San Remo and then our boatman remembers two Americans taking a boat. 
RIPLEY It's not a pattern, it's a coincidence. There must be fifty hotels in San Remo, there must have been a hundred people renting a boat on that day. 
ROVERINI 31 people. 
RIPLEY 31 people. 
Baggio appears. Speaks to Roverini. Ripley is getting cranky. 
ROVERINI That is Miss Sherwood now. Marge Sherwood. 
RIPLEY (appalled, defeated) Let her in, what's the difference?  Let her in. (Baggio is on his way to the door.) No, actually, no, I'd like it very much if you would ask her to come back later. 
Roverini nods, mutters to Baggio, who heads out. 
RIPLEY (cont'd) Thank you. 
ROVERINI (watching him) May I ask...why would you speak to your friend and not your fiancÈe? 
RIPLEY I think I just said. Ripley was handling some business for me, nor does Mr Ripley want to marry me.  Nor did he ask me every day if I would marry him. And when. 
ROVERINI Do you have a photograph of Signor Ripley? 
RIPLEY I'm not in the habit of carrying around photographs of my male friends. 
ROVERINI Now I think I have upset you. My English perhaps is coarse. 
RIPLEY It is a little coarse, yes. 
ROVERINI Sorry.  No-one has seen Signor Ripley since San - 
RIPLEY I have! 
ROVERINI You have, yes. 
RIPLEY No, I have and so has Miss Sherwood, ask her! and if I could remember which hotel he was staying at - the Goldoni! - Tom was staying at the Goldoni. 
ROVERINI Good. The Goldoni. Yes - you're right. A coincidence. (he gets up to leave) I look forward to our next meeting when I will be more careful with my English and persuade you to play me your saxophone. Alto. 
RIPLEY Absolutely. 
ROVERINI (suddenly turning) I have a witness who thinks they saw two men getting into Mr Miles' car. She wants to identify you in a - confronto - line-up. (ominously) Tomorrow then? 
RIPLEY (thrown, scrabbling) Tomorrow. 
Ripley lets them out, heaves a heavy sigh, then peeps through the door, looks down to see Roverini speaking to Marge on the stairs. 
ROVERINI (O/S) Buongiorno, Miss Sherwood.  He's in but I really don't think he wants to see anyone. 
Ripley leans against the door, the noose tightening, then suddenly a voice shocks him upright. 
PETER That's good, isn't it? 
RIPLEY (as if suffocating) No, but I thought that didn't happen in Italy, that each region was completely separate! I was sure that was the - 
PETER You've seen the papers, you know what a big deal it's been here. American tourist murdered - 
RIPLEY It's ridiculous but now you've mentioned the stench I can hardly breathe. 
A door opens. COLONEL VERRECCHIA, fresh from Rome, and a sullen wedge of a man, comes in, scowling at the couple. Ripley dare not look up in case it's Roverini.  A POLICEMAN introduces him. 
POLICEMAN Colonelo Verrecchia della Polizia di Roma. 
VERRECCHIA (to Peter, in Italian) Qui e Ripley?  Who is Ripley? 
PETER (in Italian) Lui. Him. 
Verrecchia strides past them and into a smaller, interview room at the back of the station.  His manner is ominous. 
INT. POLICE STATION, INTERVIEW ROOM, VENICE. LATE DAY. 
This room is not at all friendly. There is evidence of a locked area for cells at one wall.  A small, sour window gives onto a canal.  The main station is glimpsed through some internal windows. Peter and Ripley come through. 
Verrecchia sits down.  Verrecchia talks in staccato Italian, during which Peter translates. 
VERRECCHIA Ho assunto io la guida delle indagini in seguito alla negativa valutazione delle disdicevoli circostanze verificatesi con il mio predecessore Roverini che come e noto non e riuscito a impedire il verificarsi della scomparsa del signor Greenleaf, il quale era l'unica persona al momento passibile di incriminazione del reato di omicidio del signor Miles. 
PETER (translating) He's taken over the case because... they're annoyed the previous chap let Dickie...disappear when he was the only, he was the only suspect in Freddie's murder. 
VERRECCHIA Quando e stata l'ultima volta che il signor Ripley ha visto il signor Greenleaf? (When was the last time Ripley saw Greenleaf?) 
Ripley forgets he's not supposed to have much Italian and answers. 
RIPLEY In Rome, about three weeks ago. (shrugs) I knew that one. 
PETER (giving Ripley a look) A Roma, circa tre settimane fa. 
VERRECCHIA Dove e stato il signor Ripley da allora? 
PETER (translating) Where have you been since then? 
RIPLEY I've been backpacking. 
PETER I don't know how to translate that. (he tries) E difficile....il signor Ripley ....dormiva all'aperto, con un... 
VERRECCHIA All'aperto? Col freddo che ha fatto? 
PETER He thinks it's very cold to be sleeping outside. 
VERRECCHIA Il signor Ripley ha sviluppate tendenze omosessuali? 
PETER Are you a homosexual? (then as himself) Interesting non-sequitur. 
RIPLEY No. 
PETER (translates for him) No. (as Peter, drily) By the way, officially there are no Italian homosexuals. Makes Leonardo, Michelangelo very inconvenient. 
RIPLEY Tell him I have a fiancÈe, Dickie has a fiancÈe and Freddie Miles probably had a string of them. 
PETER (translating) Il signor Ripley ha una fidanzata, il signor Dickie ha una fidanzata e probabilmente il signor Freddie Miles ha molte fidanzate. 
VERRECCHIA (laughs) Mamma mia, quante fidanzate! 
They all laugh. 
A YOUNG BOY SINGS the soprano part of Vivaldi's STABAT MATER. A piercingly pure sound in Vivaldi's own church.  The orchestra - rehearsing - is conducted by Peter from the organ. 
Ripley slips in at the back of the church. He stands and listens. Peter sees him, smiles.  Ripley smiles back. 
EXT. VENICE, S.LUCIA RAILWAY STATION. DAY. 
MARGE appears on the steps, carrying an overnight bag. Ripley and Peter have come to meet her. 
MARGE (kissing him warmly) Hello Peter, so good to see you. 
RIPLEY Hello Marge! 
MARGE (coolly) Tom. 
They walk towards the Vaporetto. 
MARGE (cont'd) So you found Peter... 
PETER I think we sort of found each other. 
Marge smiles enigmatically. Ripley registers. 
PETER (cont'd) Where's Dickie's father? 
MARGE He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach - I don't think the food here is agreeing with him. 
RIPLEY I was looking forward to seeing him. 
MARGE Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now - a Mr MacCarron - Dickie's father's employing him. 
RIPLEY That's a terrific idea. 
MARGE He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared. 
They step onto the Vaporetto. 
MARGE (cont'd) Is that what you do before you jump in the Tiber?  I don't think so. 
EXT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY. 
The boat arrives at the entrance to the house. Peter opens the door as Ripley collects Marge's bags. 
MARGE (to Peter) Is this you? 
PETER No, it's Tom's. Splendid, eh? 
MARGE Golly. Who's paying for this? 
RIPLEY Peter found it for me. I can afford it because it's damp and, and falling down. 
INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DAY. 
Marge, entering the living room, is astonished at its grandeur. She walks around as Ripley heads for the bar. 
MARGE This is spectacular. 
PETER That's why Tom wanted you to stay.  It's better than squeezing into my room, and I know how you hate hotels. 
MARGE A hotel would've been fine. (to Ripley) We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched. 
Ripley is shaking a martini. Marge laughs, helpless, somehow raging. Peter turns 
PETER What's funny? 
RIPLEY I feel guilty. I feel like I pushed him away. I spoke and he heard you. 
HERBERT GREENLEAF (such a disappointed father) Well, if we all pushed him away what about him pushing us away? You've been a great friend to my son. Everything is someone else's fault. We all want to sow wild oars. Somebody's got to - what's the word? (Ripley shakes his head) The moment someone confronts him he lashes out.  He lashes out. You know, people always say you can't choose your parents, but you can't choose your children. 
INT. RIPLEY'S HOUSE, VENICE. DUSK. 
Ripley wakes up from an awful, chilling nightmare, his head full of ghosts. He's cramped up in an armchair, his arms in sine foetal protection. HIS DOOR KNOCKER IS BEING REPEATEDLY SHAKEN. He surfaces thickly, stumbles to the door. It's Peter and Marge. 
RIPLEY I'm sorry. I was asleep. I must have fallen asleep. 
PETER You look ghastly, Tom. Are you okay? 
MARGE Did Dickie's Dad go? 
RIPLEY He's having an early night. 
MARGE Poor man. (she heads to her room) We were knocking on that door for ever. (she fiddles inside the sleeve of her dress) I think I've broken my strap. 
PETER Not guilty. 
RIPLEY I'll fix some drinks. 
MARGE You walk in Venice! 
She takes off her shoe, examining her feet for wear and tear, then disappears into the bedroom. Peter walks over to Ripley, a little concerned. 
PETER Are you okay? 
RIPLEY I'm fine. 
PETER (a hand on his shoulder) Do you want me to stick around? 
RIPLEY It's okay. 
PETER Or I could come back. 
Ripley looks at him. That's never happened. He digs in his pocket, finds his key, gives it to Peter. Peter smiles. 
PETER (cont'd) Your key. 
INT. RIPLEY'S BATHROOM, VENICE. NIGHT. 
Ripley's in the bath. Marge knocks on his door. 
MARGE (O/S) Tom? 
RIPLEY Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long. 
MARGE (O/S) Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent. 
Ripley, irritated, opens the door, his towel wrapped around his waist. Marge is white. She's wearing a robe. She's slightly breathless. 
MARGE I found Dickie's rings. 
RIPLEY What? 
MARGE You've got Dickie's rings. 
RIPLEY I can explain. 
He can't. His eyes dart. Marge holds up the evidence. 
MARGE Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring. 
INT. RIPLEY HOUSE, LIVING ROOM. NIGHT. 
Peter has just put a band-aid over Ripley's cut hand. 
PETER You can't be angry with her.  She's upset and needs someone to blame. So she blames you.  I'll go home and talk to her.  As for you - either get a safety razor or grow a beard. 
INT. LOBBY, EUROPA REGINA HOTEL, VENICE. MORNING. 
Ripley hurries through the gleaming marble entrance. 
INT. HERBERT GREENLEAF'S SUITE, EUROPA REGINA. DAY. 
Ripley knocks on the door. It's opened by a face he doesn't recognize. A middle-aged heavy set man. It's MacCARRON, the private investigator. 
RIPLEY Is Mr Greenleaf here? 
MACCARRON Mr Ripley? I'm Alvin MacCarron. 
MARGE (O/S) I don't know, I don't know, I just know it. 
HERBERT GREENLEAF (O/S) Marge, there's female intuition, and then there are facts - 
Greenleaf sits with a scrubbed Marge, her hair pulled back, as if newly-widowed. THE RINGS SIT GLINTING ON THE COFFEE TABLE. 
HERBERT GREENLEAF Tom. 
RIPLEY Hello, sir. (smiles thinly at Marge) Marge, you should have waited, didn't Peter tell you I'd come by and pick you up? 
HERBERT GREENLEAF Marge has been telling us about the rings. 
RIPLEY You know I feel ridiculous I didn't mention them yesterday - I clean forgot - ridiculous. 
HERBERT GREENLEAF Perhaps you didn't mention them because there's only one conclusion to be drawn. 
Ripley worries about what that conclusion is as Mr Greenleaf heads into his bedroom. 
HERBERT GREENLEAF (cont'd) I'm going to take Marge for a little walk, Tom.  Mr MacCarron wants to talk with you. 
RIPLEY (feeling caged in) We could go down to the bar - no need for you to - 
HERBERT GREENLEAF No, he should talk to you alone. 
He helps Marge to her feet and leads her out. RIPLEY IS PARALYSED. He waits for the door to shut. Aimlessly he walks out onto the terrace, with its staggering, beautiful and indifferent view. 
EXT. EUROPA REGINA, THE GREENLEAF TERRACE. DAY. 
Ripley stands, steels himself for MacCarron's charges. 
RIPLEY I could probably see my bedroom from here. I can see my house. When you see where you live from a distance it's like a dream, isn't it? 
MACCARRON (coming out) I don't care for B.S. I don't care to hear it. I don't care to speak it. 
RIPLEY Okay. 
MACCARRON Why do you think Dickie's father sent him to Europe in the first place? Did you know at Princeton Dickie Greenleaf half- killed a boy? 
Ripley turns, shocked. 
MACCARRON (cont'd) At a party. Over some girl. He kicked the kid several times in the head. Put him in the hospital. The boy had a wire fixed in his jaw. The Rome Police didn't think to ask Mr Greenleaf. 
MacCarron gets up. 
MACCARRON (cont'd) Nor did they think to check whether a Thomas Ripley had ever been a student at Princeton University. I turned up a Tom Ripley who'd been a piano tuner in the music department. 
PETER Plans - good, plans for tonight or plans for the future? 
RIPLEY I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me. 
PETER You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though.  Come back. (smiles at him) You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person. 
RIPLEY Well, that's entirely your fault.  And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too. 
EXT. DECK OF THE HELLENES. SUNSET. 
Ripley stands on deck, staring at the magnificent sunset. Then a voice shakes him from his reverie. 
MEREDITH Dickie?  Dickie? 
He turns. He's caught. Suddenly he's Dickie. 
MEREDITH (cont'd) Dickie, my God! 
RIPLEY Hello Meredith. 
MEREDITH I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you... 
RIPLEY Well, you've spotted me and so you get the reward. 
MEREDITH What? 
RIPLEY Just kidding. Are you alone? 
MEREDITH Hardly. I couldn't be less alone. 
Meredith points to the UPPER DECK BALCONY where TWO OLDER COUPLES are walking around the deck. 
RIPLEY Of course.  Aunt Joan. 
MEREDITH And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much. 
RIPLEY I've thought about you. 
And now he's thinking I can't kill them all... 
MEREDITH When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding? 
RIPLEY I haven't been hiding. I've been in Police custody. They've been trying to flush out Freddie's killer. 
MEREDITH You're kidding. 
RIPLEY They're letting me have this vacation. Which is why the get-up. Which is why you haven't heard from me. 
MEREDITH You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible. 
RIPLEY I know. Look, I can't talk now. Later. Later? 
He kisses her.  Full of future. 
MEREDITH So - are you travelling under R? 
RIPLEY You know what - I am. 
MEREDITH Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley?  I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him. 
RIPLEY (horrified) Peter Smith-Kingsley? I haven't seen him in months.  No, I'm alone. (and he understands this is not any kind of lie) 
INT. PETER'S CABIN. NIGHT.

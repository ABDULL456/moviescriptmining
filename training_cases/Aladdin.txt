ALADDIN:  THE COMPLETE SCRIPT COMPILED BY BEN SCRIPPS <34RQNPQ@CMUVM.CSV.CMICH.EDU> (Portions Copyright (c) 1992 The Walt Disney Company 
PEDDLER:    Oh I come from a land From a faraway place Where the caravan camels roam Where they cut off your ear /Where it's flat and immense If they don't like your face /And the heat is intense It's barbaric, but hey--it's home! When the wind's at your back And the sun's from the west And the sand in the glass is right Come on down, Stop on by Hop a carpet and fly To another Arabian night! 
Arabian nights Like Arabian days More often than not Are hotter than hot In a lot of good ways 
Arabian nights 'Neath Arabian moons A fool off his guard Could fall and fall hard Out there on the dunes. 
Ah, Salaam and good evening to you worthy friend. Please, please, come closer--(Camera zooms in hitting peddler in face) Too close, a little too close.  (Camera zooms back out to CU)There.Welcome to Agrabah.  City of mystery, of enchantment, and the finest merchandise this side of the river Jordan, on sale today, come on down! Heh, heh.  Look at this! Yes!  Combination hookah and coffee maker--also makes Julienne fries.  Will not break (taps it on table), will not--(it falls apart)--it broke.  Ooohhh!  Look at this! Pulls out Tupperware) I have never seen one of these intact before.  This is the famous Dead Sea Tupperware. Listen.  (Pries it open, makes raspberry sound.)  Ah, still good. (Camera begins to pan to right.  PEDDLER hurries to catch it.)  Wait, don't go!  (Stop pan.)I can see that you're only interested in the exceptionally rare.  I think then, you would be most rewarded to consider...this.  (PEDDLER pulls the MAGIC LAMP out from his sleeve.) Do not be fooled by its commonplace appearance.  Like so many things, it is not what is outside, but what is inside that counts.  (Another pan, this one slower to left. Again, PEDDLER rushes to catch up.)  This is no ordinary lamp!  It once changed the course of a young man's life. A young man who liked this lamp was more than what he seemed.  A diamond in the rough.  Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?  (PEDDLER pours shiny sand from the lamp into his hand.)  It begins on a dark night (PEDDLER throws sand into the sky, where it forms a starry nightscape.) , where a dark man waits, with a dark purpose. 
(Camera tilts down to find JAFAR sitting on his horse and IAGO on his shoulder.  GAZEEM comes riding up to the pair.) 
JAFAR:  You...are late. GAZEEM:A thousand apologies, O patient one. JAFAR:  You have it, then? GAZEEM:I had to slit a few throats to get it.  (Pulls out half of the medallion.  JAFAR reaches out for it, but GAZEEM yanks it back.)  Ah, ah, ahhh!  The treasure! (IAGO squawks as he flies by and grabs the medallion.)  Ouch! JAFAR:  Trust me, my pungent friend.  You'll get what's coming to you. IAGO:   What's coming to you!  Awk! 
(JAFAR pulls out the second half of the medallion.  He connects them, and the insect medallion begins to glow.  Finally, it flies out of JAFAR's hand, scaring the horses, and is off towards the dunes.) 
JAFAR:  Quickly, follow the trail! 
(All ride off, following the glowing speck of light, until it reaches a large dune.  It separates into two and the halves plunge into the dune.  All that remains are two glowing points of light on the dune.  But then the dune begins to rise up, transforming into a giant lion's head, with the glowing points serving as the eyes.) 
JAFAR:  At last, after all my years of searching,  the cave of wonders! IAGO:       Awk!  Cave of wonders! GAZEEM: By Allah! JAFAR:  Now, remember!  Bring me the lamp.  The rest of the treasure is yours, but the lamp is mine! 
(He jumps off, landing on two ropes strung between buildings, with drying clothes on them.  He skies down them, collecting bits and pieces of clothing on him as he goes.  Finally, he's nearing the end of the rope, at a window, when a woman reaches out and slams the shutters closed.  ALADDIN slams into the shutters and falls to the street, his fall being broken by numerous awnings and the pile of clothes around him.  He pulls off the top layer of clothes and is about to enjoy his bread when...) 
GUARD 1:    There he is! GUARD 2:    You won't get away so easy! ALADDIN:    You think that was easy? 
(He looks at three women, laughing at him.) 
GUARD 1:    You two, over that way, and you, with me.  We'll find him. 
(ALADDIN pulls a sheet over him and wraps himself as a disguise. He rushes over to the women.) 
ALADDIN:    Morning, ladies. WOMAN 1:    Getting into trouble a little early today, aren't we Aladdin? ALADDIN:    Trouble?  No way.  You're only in trouble if you get caught-- 
(A hand grabs ALADDIN's shoulder and yanks him back.  It's the first GUARD.  ALADDIN's disguise falls off.) 
ALADDIN:    I'm in trouble! GUARD:  ...and this time--(A screeching sound from ABU, then the guard's turban is pulled down over his eyes.  ABU dances on the GUARD's head, laughing.) ALADDIN:    Perfect timing, Abu! ABU:        Hello! ALADDIN:    Come on, let's get outta here! Gotta keep...one jump ahead of the breadline One swing ahead of the sword I steal only what I can't afford That's everything! 
(ALADDIN battles a GUARD wielding a sword.  He dodges a couple of swings, then pulls down the GUARD's pants.  ABU raspberries the GUARD, then dodges an attack.  The GUARD swings at ALADDIN, but destroys a barrel of fish.  As ALADDIN runs off, the GUARD pulls a fish over his lower body as a pair of pants.) 
One jump ahead of the lawmen That's all, and that's no joke These guys don't appreciate I'm broke! 
(ALADDIN and ABU scamper up a pile of barrels, then kick one down on top of another GUARD.) 
LADY:   Still I think he's rather tasty 
(ALADDIN tumbles away, then puts his arm around a GUARD, acting like they're all chums.) 
ALADDIN:    Gotta eat to live, gotta steal to eat Otherwise we'd get along! GUARDS: WRONG! 
(They all jump into a pile and fight.  When they stop, ALADDIN and ABU are gone.  They are sneaking away in barrels.  They run across a flaming pit, followed by GUARDS who hop up and down, screaming in pain as they cross the rocks.  ALADDIN and ABU pass a SWORD SWALLOWER, then ABU goes back, pulls the sword out of the SWALLOWER's mouth.  ABU advances on the guards, who retreat in fear.) 
GUARD 1:    He's got a sword! GUARD 2:    You idiot--we've ALL got swords!! 
(ABU sets the sword down gently, then runs.  ALADDIN and ABU are once again surrounded, with GUARDS coming from left and right. He jumps up and climbs a robe trick being done on the street, as the GUARDS all crash into each other.) 
ALADDIN:    One jump ahead of the hoofbeats! CROWD:  Vandal! ALADDIN:    One hop ahead of the hump! CROWD:  Street rat! ALADDIN:    One trick ahead of disaster CROWD:  Scoundrel! ALADDIN:    They're quick--but I'm much faster CROWD:  Take that! 
(The GUARDS chase ALADDIN up a staircase into a room.  He grabs a carpet and jumps out the window) 
ALADDIN:    Here goes, better throw my hand in Wish me happy landin' All I gotta do is jump! 
(The GUARDS follow him out the window, but they go straight down to the street, and land in a pile with the sign "Crazy Hakim's Discount Fertilizer."  ALADDIN uses the carpet as a parachute to land safely and out of danger. ALADDIN and ABU high-five each other.) 
ALADDIN:    And now, esteemed effendi, we feast!  All right! 
(The PRINCE kicks ALADDIN into a mud puddle. The crowd laugh at him.) 
ALADDIN:    Look at that, Abu.  It's not every day you see a horse with two rear ends! 
(The PRINCE stops and turns back to ALADDIN.) 
PRINCE: You are a worthless street rat.  You were born a street rat, you'll die a street rat, and only your fleas will mourn you. 
(ALADDIN rushes the PRINCE, but the doors to the castle slam shut in his face.) 
ALADDIN:    I'm not worthless.  And I don't have fleas.  Come on, Abu.  Let's go home. 
(ALADDIN makes the climb to his home with the view, then tucks in ABU for the night.) 
ALADDIN:    Riffraff, street rat. I don't buy that. If only they'd look closer Would they see a poor boy?  No siree. They'd find out, there's so much more to me. 
(He pulls back a curtain to reveal the beautiful palace.) 
Someday, Abu, things are gonna change.  We'll be rich, live in a palace, and never have any problems at all. 
(Dissolve to same shot during day.  Cut to int. of SULTAN's chamber. The door bursts open, and PRINCE ACHMED storms in, missing the rear end of his pants.) 
(JAFAR pulls a rope, which reveals a hidden entrance to his chambers.) 
JAFAR:  Calm yourself, Iago. IAGO:       Then I'd grab him around the head.  Whack! Whack! JAFAR:  (Speaking over IAGO.)  Soon, I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit. IAGO:       And then I stuff the crackers down his throat!  Ha ha! 
(The pair pass through a door and slam it shut.  Diss. to ext. gardens at night.  A shadowy figure walks through.  We see it is JASMINE in disguise.  She reaches the palace wall, then begins to climb it. She is tugged from behind by RAJAH.) 
JASMINE:    Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.  But I can't stay here and have my life lived for me.  I'll miss you.(She begins to climb again, and is helped up by RAJAH, who begins to whine and whimper.)  Good bye! 
(She disappears over the wall. Cut to daytime on the street  ALADDIN and ABU are up to their capers again.  They are on top of the awning of a fruit stand.) 
ALADDIN:        Okay, Abu.  Go! 
(ABU dips over the edge and looks at the PROPRIETOR.) 
PROPRIETOR: (To passing crowd)  Try this, your taste buds will dance and sing. (ABU grabs a melon and hangs there, distracting his attention.)  Hey, get your paws off that. ABU:            Blah blah blah! PROPRIETOR: Why, you!  Get away from here, you filthy ape! 
(He grabs the melon away from ABU.  But in the foreground, ALADDIN dips down and snatches another melon from the stand.) 
ABU:            Bye bye! 
(He zings back up.  The PROPRIETOR takes the melon to the front, where he places it on top of a stack.  He looks confused, like he has just done this.) 
(ALADDIN and JASMINE have been getting closer and closer, until ALADDIN leans in to kiss her.  He is interrupted, however, by the GUARDS, who have found them.) 
GUARD:  Here you are! ALADDIN and JASMINE:    They've found me!  (To each other) They're after you? JASMINE:    My father must have sent them-- ALADDIN:    Do you trust me? JASMINE:    What? ALADDIN:    Do you trust me? (He extends his hand) JASMINE:    Yes. (She takes it.) ALADDIN:    Then jump! 
(They both jump off the roof, fall and land in a pile of salt.  They try to get away, but the exit is blocked by a GUARD.) 
GUARD:  We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat? 
(Again, the GUARD's turban is pulled down by ABU, but more guards are here and block the exit.  The first GUARD pulls ABU off his head and throws him in a vase.  Three other GUARDS grab ALADDIN.) 
GUARD:  It's the dungeon for you, boy. ALADDIN:    Hey, get off of me! JASMINE:    Let go of him. GUARD:  (Not realizing she is the princess) Look what we have here, men--a street mouse.  (He throws her down.) JASMINE:    (standing up and pulling off the hood of her cloak) Unhand him, by order of the princess. 
(The GUARDS suddenly stop and bow, forcing ALADDIN to bow as well.) 
GUARD:  Princess Jasmine. ALADDIN:    The princess? ABU:        (peeking out from the vase) The princess? GUARD:  What are you doing outside the palace?  And with this street rat? JASMINE:    That's not your concern.  Do as I command.  Release him! GUARD:  Well, I would, princess, but my orders come from Jafar.  You'll have to take it up with him. 
(The GUARDS drag ALADDIN out, bowing as they go.) 
JASMINE:    (getting a very pissed-off look) Believe me, I will. 
(Cut to int. of palace, JAFAR emerging from his secret chambers.  He slides the door shut carefully, but the princess comes storming in before he is finished.  He slams it shut, pinning IAGO inside the door frame.) 
ABU:        Yeah, yeah, yeah. ALADDIN:    Don't worry, Abu.  I'll never see her again.  I'm a street rat, remember, and there's a law. She's gotta marry a prince, she deserves it. 
(ABU finally frees ALADDIN's hands.) 
ABU:        Ta da! ALADDIN:    (Rubbing his wrists) I'm a--I'm a fool OLD MAN:    You're only a fool if you give up, boy. 
(We see an OLD MAN sitting in the corner that neither ALADDIN nor ABU have seen before.) 
ALADDIN:    Who are you? OLD MAN:    A lowly prisoner, like yourself.  But together, perhaps we can be more. ALADDIN:    I'm listening. OLD MAN:    There is a cave, boy.  A cave of wonders.  Filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Treasure enough to impress even your princess, I'd wager. 
(Listeners will note that the OLD MAN pronounced the word 'princess' as "prin-CESS" rather than the standard pronunciation of "PRIN-cess."   The OLD MAN turns his back, and IAGO sticks his head out of JAFAR's "old man" disguise.) 
IAGO:       Jafar, can ya hurry it up?  I'm dyin' in here! ALADDIN:    But the law says that only a prince can marry-- OLD MAN:    You've heard of the golden rule, haven't you boy? Whoever has the gold makes the rules.(He grins, showing a hideously bad mouth.) ALADDIN:    So why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me? OLD MAN:    I need a young man with strong legs and a strong back to go in after it. ALADDIN:    Ah, one problem.  It's out there, we're in here? 
(The OLD MAN walks to a wall and pushes open a hidden exit.) 
OLD MAN:    Mmm, mmm, mmm.,  Things aren't always what they seem.  So, do we have a deal? 
(ALADDIN looks at ABU, who shrugs his shoulders.) 
ABU:        Oh, hmm. 
OLD MAN:    Ha ha ha ha!  Yes!  At last!  Ha ha ha ha! 
(ALADDIN has climbed out with the assistance of ABU.  But the OLD MAN kicks aside ABU and grabs ALADDIN's wrist.) 
ALADDIN:    What are you doing? OLD MAN:    Giving you your reward.  (JAFAR returns to his normal voice.) Your eternal reward. 
(He pulls out a crooked dagger and is about to stab ALADDIN, when ABU bites him on the wrist.  He screams, but lets go of ALADDIN, who falls into the cave.  OLD MAN throws ABU into the cave as well.  They fall.  CARPET sees this, but is pinned under a boulder.  It struggles to break free, then does.  It races up and catches ALADDIN, but he has already hit the wall several times, and is unconscious.  On the surface, the cave roars one final time, then sinks back into the sand.  JAFAR pulls off his disguise.) 
JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! It's mine.  It's all mine! I (He can't find it in his pocket)--- where is it?  No. NO!! 
(Kiss fade to JASMINE's bedroom.  She is sitting on her bed, next to RAJAH who looks sad. The SULTAN walks in.) 
SULTAN: Jasmine?  Oh, dearest.  What's wrong? JASMINE:    Jafar...has...done something... terrible.  (She looks as if she's been crying.) SULTAN: There, there, there, my child--we'll set it right. Now, tell me everything. 
(Cut to int. of cave.  ALADDIN lies unconscious on the CARPET. ABU tries to wake him.) 
ABU:        Oh, oh. Aladdin?  Wake up.  Aladdin. 
(CARPET rises up, lifting ALADDIN up.  He awakes slowly.) 
ALADDIN:    Oh, my head. (He looks at the entrance sealed in.) We're trapped.  (Angry, shaking his fists at the entrance) That two faced son-of-a-jackal!  (Calmer) Whoever he was, he's long gone with that lamp. ABU:        Aha! 
Life is your restaurant And I'm your maitre' d! C'mon whisper what it is you want You ain't never had a friend like me. 
(GENIE appears as a plate of chicken, then returns to normal, but enlarges his ear to listen to ALADDIN.  Finally, he explodes into four duplicate GENIEs.) 
Yes sir, we pride ourselves on service You're the boss, the king, the shah! Say what you wish, it's yours!  True dish How about a little more Baklava? 
(The GENIEs give him a shave, haircut and manicure, then ALADDIN appears in a comfy chair (eh?)  surrounded by the treasure and being fanned by women.  The GENIE appears and fills the screen with baklava.) 
Try some of column 'A' Try all of column 'B' I'm in the mood to help you dude You ain't never had a friend like me 
(ALADDIN rises up on a column of food with a giant A on top, then jumps to another column with a B on top.  He falls off and is caught by a cushion held by GENIE.  He opens his mouth, and his tongue turns into a staircase.  A miniature GENIE dressed like a magician comes out.) 
(The mini GENIE does a little dance with the GENIE's two giant hands.  At the end, they surround the mini GENIE and squish him into nothing.) 
Can your friends do this? Do your friends do that? Do your friends pull this out their little hat Can your friends go poof! Well looky here Can your friends go Abracadabra, let 'er rip And then make the sucker disappear? 
(The GENIE pulls off his head, duplicates it, then juggles them. He tosses them to ALADDIN, who juggles with one hand and spins one of the heads on his fingertip like a basketball.  He tosses the heads back onto the GENIE, who proceeds to try and pull himself out of a hat at his base.  He spirals around and around until he turns into a white rabbit.  The rabbit transforms into a purple dragon (very reminiscent of Figment from EPCOT Center). The dragon breathes fire, which turns into three HAREM GIRLS, who dance around ALADDIN.  Just as he begins to enjoy them, they disappear.) 
So don't you sit there slack jawed, buggy eyed I'm here to answer all your midday prayers You got me bona fide, certified You got a genie for a charg? d'affairs! I got a powerful urge to help you out So what you wish I really want to know You got a wish that's three miles long, no doubt So all you gotta do is rub like so, and oh! 
(GENIE imitates what he is calling ALADDIN, then turns into a certificate which rolls up and surrounds ALADDIN.  GENIE pulls a list {written in Arabic} out of ALADDIN's ear, which he uses to rub his behind like drying off after a shower.) 
GENIE:  Me?  No one's ever asked me that before. Well, in my case, ah, forget it. ALADDIN:    What?  No, tell me. GENIE:  Freedom. ALADDIN:    You're a prisoner? GENIE:  It's all part-and-parcel, the whole genie gig. (Grows gigantic, voice echoes) Phenomenal cosmic powers!  (Shrinks down, cramped in MAGIC LAMP.) Itty bitty living space ALADDIN:    Genie, that's terrible. GENIE:  (Comes out of the LAMP) But, oh--to be free.  Not have to go "Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need? Poof! What do you need?"  To be my own master, such a thing would be greater than all the magic and all the treasures in all  the world! But what am I talking about, here?  Let's get real here.  It's not gonna happen.  Genie, wake up and smell the hummus ALADDIN:    Why not? GENIE:  The only way I get outta this is if my master wishes me out.  So you can guess how often that's happened. ALADDIN:    I'll do it. I'll set you free. GENIE:  (Head turns into Pinocchio's with a long nose) Uh huh, right.  Whoop! ALADDIN:    No, really, I promise.  (He pushes the nose back in and GENIE's head returns to normal.) After make my first two wishes, I'll use my third wish to set you free.   (He holds out his hand) GENIE:  Well, here's hopin'.  (Shakes ALADDIN's hand.) O.K.   Let's make some magic!  (Turns into a magician.)  So how 'bout it.  What is it you want most? ALADDIN:    Well, there's this girl-- GENIE:  Eehhh! (Like a buzzer, and GENIE's chest shows a heart with a cross through it.)  Wrong!  I can't make anybody fall in love, remember? ALADDIN:    Oh, but Genie.  She's smart and fun and... GENIE:  Pretty? ALADDIN:    Beautiful.  She's got these eyes that just...and this hair, wow...and her smile. GENIE:  (Sitting in a Parisian cafe with ABU and CARPET.) Ami.  C'est l'amour. ALADDIN:    But she's the princess.  To even have a chance, I'd have to be a--hey, can you make me a prince? GENIE:  Let's see here.  (Has a "Royal Cookbook".) Uh, chicken a'la king? (Pulls out a chicken with a crown on its head)  Nope.  Alaskan king crab? (Yanks out his finger, and we see SEBASTIAN the crab from "The Little Mermaid"  clamped on.)  Ow, I hate it when they do that.  Caesar's salad? (A dagger comes out and tries to stab him.) Et tu, Brute?  Ah, to make a prince.  (Looks slyly at ALADDIN.)  Now is that an official wish?  Say the words! ALADDIN:    Genie, I wish for you to make me a prince! GENIE:  All right!  Woof woof woof woof! (Takes on square shoulders and looks like Arsenio Hall. Then becomes a tailor/fashion designer.)  First, that fez and vest combo is much too third century. These patches--what are we trying to say--beggar?  No! Let's work with me here. (He takes ALADDIN's measurements, snaps his fingers and ALADDIN is outfitted in his prince costume.)  I like it, muy macho!  Now, still needs something.  What does it say to me?  It says mode of transportation.  Excuse me, monkey boy!  Aqui, over here!  (ABU tries to cover himself with CARPET, but GENIE zaps him and he flies over.) ABU:        Uh oh! GENIE:  Here he comes, (ALADDIN and GENIE are on a game show set, where ALADDIN stands behind a podium with "AL" on it.)  And what better way to make your grand entrance on the streets of Agrabah, than riding your very own brand new camel!  Watch out, it spits!  (A door bearing the GENIE's head on it opens, where ABU is transformed into a camel.  He spits out the side of his mouth on cue.  But the GENIE's not sure.)  Mmm, not enough.  (He snaps his fingers and ABU turns into a fancy white horse.) Still not enough.  Let's see.  What do you need? (The GENIE snaps his fingers repeatedly, turning ABU into:  a duck, an ostrich, a turtle, and a '57 Cadillac, with license plate "ABU 1."   (That one's a guess, I don't know cars, but judging by the tail fins, 'nuff said.)  Finally, he's returned to normal.)  Yes!!  Esalalumbo,  shimin dumbo!  Whoa!! (And on the keyword of the spell, Dumbo, ABU turns into an elephant.  CARPET struggles to get out from under ABU's size 46 feet.)  Talk about your trunk space, check this action out! 
(ABU sees his reflection in a pool of water, then jumps into a tree. The tree naturally bends right back down to the ground, where ABU hangs on and looks at ALADDIN upside down.) 
ALADDIN:    Abu, you look good. GENIE:  He's got the outfit, he's got the elephant, but we're not through yet.  Hang on to your turban, kid, cause we're gonna make you a star! 
(We zoom out slowly with the oasis in the distance, as fireworks begin to explode outward.  Cut to a CU of a pile of toys. (Look for the BEAST here.)  We tilt up and see the SULTAN balancing them.  He carefully balances the last piece on top, then sits back and sighs.  JAFAR storms in, though, and the pile collapses.) 
JAFAR:  Sire, I have found a solution to the problem with your daughter. IAGO:   Awk!  The problem with your daughter! SULTAN: Oh, really? JAFAR:  (Unrolling a scroll) Right here.  "If the princess has not chosen a husband by the appointed time, then the sultan shall choose for her." SULTAN: But Jasmine hated all those suitors!  (He tries to stuff a cracker into IAGO's mouth.  IAGO backs away.  The SULTAN absentmindedly pulls the cracker back.)  How could I choose someone she hates? (IAGO is relieved, but the SULTAN quickly stuffs a cracker in his mouth.) JAFAR:  Not to worry, my liege.  There is more.  If, in the event a suitable prince cannot be found, a princess must then be wed to...hmm...interesting. SULTAN: What?  Who? JAFAR:  The royal vizier!  Why, that would be...me! SULTAN: Why, I thought the law says that only a prince can marry a princess, I'm quite sure. JAFAR:  Desperate times call for desperate measures, my lord.  (He pulls out the staff and hypnotizes the SULTAN with it.) SULTAN: Yes...desperate measures... JAFAR:  You will order the princess to marry me. SULTAN: I...will order...the princess...to...(the spell breaks momentarily)...but you're so old! JAFAR:  (Holds the staff closer) The princess will marry me! SULTAN: The princess will marry...(the spell is again broken, this time by the trumpet fanfare of "Prince Ali".)  What? What is that?  That music!  Ha ha ha. Jafar., you must come and see this! 
(We see an advancing parade, led by what appears to be the GENIE in human form as a MAJOR.) 
MARCHERS:   Make way for Prince Ali! SWORDSMEN: Say hey!  It's Prince Ali! MAJOR:  Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar, Hey you, let us through, it's a bright new star, Now come, be the first on your block to meet his eye! Make way, here he comes, Ring bells, bang the drums. You're gonna love this guy 
(The MAJOR mingles amongst different crowd members.) 
Prince Ali, fabulous he, Ali Ababwa! Genuflect, show some respect Down on one knee 
(ABU the elephant marches through town, with ALADDIN (ALI) on his back.) 
Now try your best to stay calm Brush up your Sunday Salaam And come and meet his spectacular coterie. 
(JASMINE has been watching from the balcony of the palace.  She humphs it off, then leaves.) 
CHORUS: He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys! (He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys!) And to view them, he charges no fee! (He's generous, so generous) He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies! (Proud to work for him) They bow to his whim, love serving him They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!  Prince Ali! 
(ALADDIN throws gold coins out to the people, who rush over to collect them.  ABU and the parade march up the steps of the palace and inside.  The SULTAN runs back inside to the door to the throne room, but JAFAR stands in front of the door. Suddenly, it bursts open, with ABU leading the way, and crushing JAFAR and IAGO behind the door.) 
GENIE:  Prince Ali! Amorous he!  Ali Ababwa Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see! And that,good people, is why He got dolled up and dropped by With sixty elephants, llamas galore With his bears and lions A brass band and more With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers His birds that warble on key Make way for Prince Ali! 
(More and more fanfare build up until ALADDIN flies off ABU's back on MAGIC CARPET and flies down to the SULTAN.  JAFAR slams the door shut.) 
SULTAN: (Clapping) Splendid, absolutely marvelous. ALADDIN:    (Takes on a deeper voice.)  Ahem.  Your majesty, I have journeyed from afar to seek your daughter's hand. SULTAN: Prince Ali Ababwa!  Of course.  I'm delighted to meet you.  (He rushes over and shakes ALI's hand.) This is my royal vizier, Jafar.  He's delighted too. JAFAR:  (Extremely dryly) Ecstatic.  I'm afraid, Prince Abooboo-- ALADDIN:    --Ababwa! JAFAR:  Whatever.  You cannot just parade in here uninvited and expect to-- SULTAN: ...by Allah, this is quite a remarkable device. (He tugs at the tassels, and they tug his moustache.)  I don't suppose I might... ALADDIN:    Why certainly, your majesty.  Allow me. 
(He helps the SULTAN up onto the CARPET, and he plops down. JAFAR pins the CARPET down on the floor with the staff.) 
JAFAR:  Sire, I must advise against this-- SULTAN: --Oh, button up, Jafar.  Learn to have a little fun. 
(He kicks away the staff and CARPET and SULTAN fly away.  IAGO, who was standing on the head of the staff, falls down, repeatedly bopping the staff with his beak as he descends.  SULTAN and CARPET fly high into the ceiling, then begin a dive-bomb attack, flying under ABU, scaring him.  The flight continues in the background, while JAFAR and ALI talk in the foreground.) 
JAFAR:  Just where did you say you were from? ALADDIN:    Oh, much farther than you've traveled, I'm sure. (He smiles.  JAFAR does not.) JAFAR:  Try me.  (IAGO lands on the staff.) SULTAN: Look out, Polly! 
(They all duck in time as the CARPET whizzes centimetres over their heads.  CARPET returns and the SULTAN chases IAGO around the room.) 
GENIE:  How's our beau doing? 
(CARPET cuts his neck with his finger.) 
ALADDIN:    Good kitty, take off.  Down kitty. (He takes off his turban to brush RAJAH away.) JASMINE:    (She looks at him thinking she has seen him before.)  Wait, wait.  Do I know you? ALADDIN:    (Quickly replaces his turban) Uh, no, no. JASMINE:    You remind me of someone I met in  the marketplace. ALADDIN:    The marketplace?  (A bee buzzes around his head.) I have servants that go to the marketplace for me. Why I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met. JASMINE:    (She looks disappointed.)  No, I guess not. BEE:        (It's the GENIE) Enough about you, Casanova.  Talk about her! She's smart,  fun, the hair, the eyes. Anything--pick a feature! ALADDIN:    Um, Princess Jasmine?  You're very... BEE:        Wonderful, glorious, magnificent, punctual! ALADDIN:    Punctual! JASMINE:    Punctual? BEE:        Sorry. ALADDIN:    Beautiful. BEE:        Nice recovery. JASMINE:    Hmm.  I'm rich too, you know. ALADDIN:    Yeah! JASMINE:    The daughter of a sultan ALADDIN:    I know. JASMINE:    A fine prize for any  prince to marry. ALADDIN:    Uh, right.  Right.  A prince like me. BEE:        (Buzzing in his ear) Warning! Warning! JASMINE:    Right, a prince like you.  And every other stuffed  shirt, swaggering, peacock I've met! BEE:        (Rear end on fire, wearing goggles and crashing) Mayday! Mayday! JASMINE:    Just go jump off a balcony! (She turns and walks away) ALADDIN:    What? BEE:        Stop her! Stop her! Do you want me to sting her? ALADDIN:    (Swats at bee) Buzz off! BEE:        Okay, fine.  But remember--bee yourself! (BEE buzzes into his turban) ALADDIN:    Yeah, right! JASMINE:    What!?! ALADDIN:    Uh, you're right.  You aren't just some prize to be won.  (He looks disappointed.)  You should be free to make your own choice.  (JASMINE and RAJAH look at each other in confusion.)  I'll go now. (He steps up on the ledge and drops off.) JASMINE:    No! ALADDIN:    (Pokes his head up from over the edge) What?  What? JASMINE:    (Now she's amazed) How--how are you doing that? (She looks over the edge and sees the CARPET.) ALADDIN:    It's a magic carpet. JASMINE:    It's lovely.  (CARPET takes JASMINE's hand with a tassel.) ALADDIN:    You, uh, you don't want to go for a ride, do you? We could get out of the palace, see the world. JASMINE:    Is it safe? ALADDIN:    Sure.  Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (She looks at him at the saying of that all- important line) What? ALADDIN:    (Extends his hand the same as before) Do you trust me? JASMINE:    (Gets a sly grin on her face) Yes. 
(She takes his hand and gets up on CARPET.  It zooms into the sky, knocking them both into sitting positions.  The music of "A Whole New World" swells.  JASMINE looks back and sees RAJAH looking up at her questioningly.  She gasps as they fly over the palace wall and into the sky.) 
ALADDIN:    I can show you the world Shining, shimmering, splendid. Tell me princess, now when did you last Let your heart decide? 
(CARPET zooms down through the town, stopping slightly to pick a flower.  It gives the flower to ALADDIN, who gives it to JASMINE. She smiles.) 
I can open your eyes Take you wonder by wonder Over, sideways, and under On a magic carpet ride 
(CARPET does as ALADDIN sings, then zooms into the clouds.) 
A whole new world! A new fantastic point of view No one to tell us no Or where to go Or say we're only dreaming 
(JASMINE looks back and watches Agrabah disappear from sight.  CARPET flies in and out of the clouds.) 
JASMINE:    A whole new world A dazzling place I never knew But when I'm way up here It's crystal clear That now I'm in a whole new world with you! 
(CARPET hovers along over a lake, and we see the reflection of the moon in the lake.  Fireworks burst and we see the couple at a Chinese New Year celebration, sitting on a rooftop.) 
JASMINE:    It's all so magical. ALADDIN:    Yeah. JASMINE:    (She looks at him and decides to burst the bubble) It's a shame Abu had to miss this. ALADDIN:    Nah.  He hates fireworks.  (CARPET looks up realizing what is happening.)  He doesn't really like flying either. (And now ALADDIN realizes it) That is...oh no! JASMINE:    (She pulls off his turban) You are the boy from the market!  I knew it.  Why did you lie to me? ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry. JASMINE:    Did you think I was stupid? ALADDIN:    No! JASMINE:    That I wouldn't figure it out? ALADDIN:    No.  I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.  No, that's not what I meant. JASMINE:    Who are you?  Tell me the truth! ALADDIN:    The truth? (He looks at CARPET who wave him on, giving up hope.)  The truth...the truth is...I sometimes dress as a commoner to escape the pressures of palace life.  (CARPET slumps down in defeat.)  But I really am a prince! (The feather on his turban falls down over his eyes.) JASMINE:    Why didn't you just tell me? ALADDIN:    Well, you know, um...royalty going out into the city in disguise, it sounds a little strange, don't you think? JASMINE:    Not that strange. 
(She flicks up the feather and cuddles with him.  CARPET puts a tassel under his "chin" and looks mystified.  Dissolve to ext. of palace balcony, where ALADDIN and JASMINE return.  CARPET forms a set of steps and she descends.  ALADDIN then descends just below the balcony.) 
JASMINE:    Good night, my handsome prince. ALADDIN:    Sleep well, princess. 
(They slowly lean forward to kiss, but CARPET bumps him up and they kiss sooner than expected.  She walks away slowly then turns and looks at him. Finally she enters her room through the curtain.) 
ALADDIN:    Yes!  (He falls back onto the CARPET, who descends to the ground.) For the first time in my life, things are starting to go right. 
(He looks up at JASMINE's balcony, and four sets of hands grab him.) 
ALADDIN:    Hey!  What?  (A gag is tied around his mouth. Muffled words) Abu!  Abu!  (We see the elephant hanging from a net tied in a tree.) GUARD:  Hold him! 
(Shackles are placed on his feet and his hands.  Another GUARD ties CARPET in a knot around a tree.) 
JAFAR:  I'm afraid you've worn out your welcome, Prince Abooboo.  (Walks away.)  Make sure he's never found. 
(A GUARD hits him in the head, and he falls unconscious.  Cut to a cliff, where GUARDS laugh as ALADDIN's body drops into the water. He is conscious now, but his feet are tied to a rock.  The rock hits the sea bottom, then the turban lands and the lamp tumbles out.  He sees this and struggles to rub the lamp.  However, he loses consciousness and falls to the floor.  The lamp, unsettled by his movement, rolls down and rubs against his hands. It shakes, and GENIE emerges with a bath brush, rubber duckie, and shower cap) 
SULTAN: Oh, oh, oh my! ALADDIN:    Your highness, Jafar's been controlling you with this!  (He advances the staff) SULTAN: What?  Jafar?  You, you traitor! 
(The trio advances on JAFAR.) 
JAFAR:  Your majesty, all of this can be explained. SULTAN: Guards! Guards! IAGO:       Well, that's it--we're dead, forget about it.  Just dig a grave for both of us.  We're dead. 
(But JAFAR sees the lamp in ALADDIN's pocket.  He makes a move, but is grabbed by guards.) 
SULTAN: Arrest Jafar at once. JAFAR:  This is not done yet, boy! 
(JAFAR pulls a vial from his pocket.  ALADDIN sees this and rushes him, but JAFAR throws the vial to the floor.  A large red cloud appears.  When it is gone, so is JAFAR.) 
SULTAN: Find him, search everywhere! ALADDIN:    Jasmine, are you all right? JASMINE:    Yes. 
(They lean in to kiss, but the SULTAN barges between them.) 
SULTAN: Jafar, my most trusted counselor, plotting against me all this time.  Just horrible.  How will I ever- (He stops in mid sentence and looks at the pair.) Can it be true?  My daughter has finally chosen a suitor? (She nods) Ha ha!  Praise Allah!  You brilliant boy, I could kiss you!   I won't--I'll leave that to my--.  You two will be wed at once! Yes, yes.  And you'll be happy and prosperous, and then my boy, you will be sultan! ALADDIN:    Sultan? SULTAN: Yes, a fine upstanding youth like yourself, a person of your unimpeachable moral character is exactly what this kingdom needs!  (ALADDIN looks concerned at this.) 
(Cut to int. of JAFAR's chambers.  JAFAR and IAGO enter.) 
IAGO:       We gotta get outta here!  We gotta get--  I gotta start packing, your highness.  Only essentials. (IAGO starts throwing things out of his cage. JAFAR smiles broadly.)  Travel light! Bring the guns, the weapons, the knives (Stops and takes out a picture of himself    and JAFAR) and how about this picture?  I don't know--I think I'm making a weird face in it. (JAFAR starts to laugh wildly.) Oh, boy--he's gone nuts.  He's cracked.  (IAGO flies down to him and knocks on his head.)  Jafar? Jafar?  Get a grip, Jafar! (JAFAR grabs him around the neck) Good grip! JAFAR:  Prince Ali is nothing more than that ragged urchin Aladdin.  He has the lamp, Iago. IAGO:       Why that miserable-- JAFAR:  But you are going to relieve him of it! IAGO:       Me? 
(Cut to behind the curtain, where JASMINE is peeking.  ALADDIN appears at the bottom of the stairs.) 
ALADDIN:    Jasmine? JASMINE:    Ali, where have you been? ALADDIN:    There's something I've got to tell you. JASMINE:    The whole kingdom has turned out for father's announcement! ALADDIN:    No! But Jasmine, listen to me, please! JASMINE:    Good luck!  (She pushes him out onto the platform with the SULTAN, where he overlooks the entire crowd.) SULTAN: ...Ali Ababwa! ALADDIN:    Oh, boy! 
(Far above, IAGO and JAFAR watch through a window.) 
IAGO:   Look at them, cheering that little pipsqueak. JAFAR:  Let them cheer. 
(He lifts the lamp and rubs it.  GENIE comes out.) 
GENIE:  You know Al, I'm getting (turns and sees JAFAR) reallyyyyyy--I don't think you're him.  (He descends and consults a playbill.)  Tonight, the role of Al will be played by a tall, dark and sinister ugly man. JAFAR:  I am your master now.  (He throws GENIE to the ground and puts his foot on GENIE's face.) GENIE:  I was afraid of that. JAFAR:  Genie, grant me my first wish.  I wish to rule on high, as sultan!!! 
(Cut to ext where dark clouds circle the castle.  The castle shakes. The roof rips off and the SULTAN and ALADDIN duck.) 
ALADDIN:    Whoa! SULTAN: Bless my soul.  What is this?  What is going on? 
(His turban lifts off his head.  When he grabs it, his whole body flies up, then is stripped of all his clothing except his boxer shorts.  The clothing reappears on JAFAR.) 
JAFAR:  Heh heh heh! SULTAN: Jafar, you vile betrayer. IAGO:       That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you. ALADDIN:    Oh, yeah?  Well, we'll just see about that!  (Pulls off his own turban, but finds it empty)  The lamp! JAFAR:  Finders-keepers, Abooboo. 
(They both look up and see a gigantic GENIE lift the palace into the clouds..  ALADDIN whistles and CARPET flies up to greet him. They fly up near the GENIE's head.) 
(He zaps ALADDIN.  JASMINE rushes him, and he throws her to the ground.  ALADDIN rushes and grabs the staff.) 
ALADDIN:    Get the lamp! 
(JASMINE runs to it.  JAFAR, however, shakes off ALADDIN, then zaps her into an hourglass.) 
JAFAR:  Ah, ah, ah, princess--Your time is up! 
(Sand begins to fall from the top onto her.) 
ALADDIN:    Jasmine! IAGO:       Oh, nice shot, Jaf-- (he is knocked out by ABU.) 
(ABU rushes for the lamp.) 
JAFAR:  Don't toy with me!  (He's zapped into a toy monkey. ALADDIN:    Abu! 
(CARPET rushes in.) 
JAFAR:  Things are unraveling fast, now boy. (CARPET is zapped and unravels.  ALADDIN again rushes for the lamp.)  Get the point?  (His path is blocked by large swords sticking in the floor.  JAFAR grabs the lamp and laughs hideously. ALADDIN pulls a sword out of the floor.) I'm just getting warmed up!  (He breathes a ring of fire around ALADDIN.) ALADDIN:    Are you afraid to fight me yourself, you cowardly snake? JAFAR:  A snake, am I?  Perhaps you'd like to see how snake-like I can be!  (He smiles broadly, and we see a snake's tongue come out from behind his teeth.  He then turns into a giant cobra, and the ring of fire around ALADDIN becomes part of the snake encircling ALADDIN.  The snake JAFAR makes moves on ALADDIN, and on the third try, ALADDIN swings the sword and hits JAFAR.  Cut to GENIE cheerleaders wearing 'A' sweaters.) 
GENIE:  Rickem, rockem, rackem, rake--stick that sword into that snake! JAFAR:  You stay out of thissss! 
(A black lamp appears at JAFAR's base.  JAFAR is busy conjuring.) 
JAFAR:  The universe is mine to command, to control! ALADDIN:    Not so fast, Jafar!  Aren't you forgetting something? (JAFAR looks down questioningly) You wanted to be a genie, you got it!  And everything that goes with it! 
(Shackles appear on JAFAR's wrists.) 
JAFAR:  No!  No! IAGO:       I'm gettin' out of here!  Come on, you're the genie, I don't want-- 
(IAGO tries to fly away, but is sucked in with JAFAR.) 
ALADDIN:    Phenomenal cosmic powers!  Itty bitty living space. GENIE:  Al, you little genius, you! 
(ABU turns back to normal, the CARPET re-ravels, JASMINE, the SULTAN and RAJAH are standing together.  RAJAH jumps up into the arms of the SULTAN, then they are all transformed.  The SULTAN is crushed because of the weight of the new RAJAH.  The palace reappears where it used to be in the city.  ALADDIN is left holding the new lamp.) 
JAFAR:  (Both from inside the lamp.)  Get your blasted beak out of my face! IAGO:       Oh, shut up, you moron! JAFAR:  Don't tell me to shut up! GENIE:  Allow me.  (He takes the lamp and goes to the balcony.  He is now wearing a baseball cap.  He winds up as if to throw the lamp, but opens his palm flat and flicks it out into the desert with his finger.) Ten- thousand years in a cave of wonders ought to chill him out! 
(JAFAR and IAGO continue to argue as they fade out.  JASMINE walks over to ALADDIN.  They hold hands, but both look sad.) 
ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I'm sorry I lied to you about being a prince. JASMINE:    I know why you did. ALADDIN:    Well, I guess...this... is goodbye?  (GENIE pokes his head around the corner shocked at what he is hearing.) JASMINE:    Oh, that stupid law.  This isn't fair--I love you. GENIE:  (Wipes away a tear)  Al, no problem. You've still got one wish left.  Just say the word and you're a prince again. ALADDIN:    But Genie, what about your freedom? GENIE:  Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.  This is love.  (He leans down next to her.)  Al, you're not gonna find another girl like her in a million years.  Believe me, I know.  I've looked. ALADDIN:    Jasmine, I do love you, but I've got to stop pretending to be something I'm not. JASMINE:    I understand. 
(They take one final look into each other's eyes, then ALADDIN turns to the GENIE.)

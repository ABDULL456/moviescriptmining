October 2007 
EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL - DUSK 
A few cars scatter the parking lot. WE hear GRUNTS followed by the distinct sound of basketballs shredding net. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - CONTINUOUS 
An empty gymnasium except for a shirtless MIKE O'DONNELL, 17. Mike stands feet BEYOND the 3 point line, grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots. SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. This kid's automatic. 
Mike's hair, a pompadour mullet a la `21 Jump Street' and short shorts circa 1989. 
Mustached and curly haired COACH HARVEY, 40, enters. 
COACH HARVEY Hey, O'Donnell, save some for the game. 
Mike sinks one last jumper, turns to the Coach. 
MIKE Just warming up, Coach. 
Coach Harvey hands Mike a towel. 
COACH HARVEY First game of the season and the scouts are already lining up. You have half the season I know you're capable of, you can play anywhere you want, Mike. 
MIKE That's the plan coach. 
The rest of the FITCH FALCONS basketball team jogs out from the locker room followed by a PHOTOGRAPHER. 
COACH HARVEY Round up, Jock Straps! Picture time. 
The Team assembles in the middle of the court. A PLAYER kneeling in front holds a sign, `FITCH FALCONS, 1989'. 
MIKE Hold on.   Ed's not here yet. 
DOM, 17, handsome, tall, long rat tail, scoffs- 
DOM Who cares?      He's the water boy. 
MIKE And you suck, Dom, but we're letting you in the picture. 
A shoving match breaks out between Mike and Dom. 
COACH HARVEY Hey!   Hey!     Knock it off. 
Coach Harvey pulls the Players apart just as the gym doors burst open. ED FREEDMAN, 17, sporting a jacket over a WIZARD costume, runs in, trips on his robe, gets up, peels his clothes off. 
ED Sorry I'm late. I was locked in a life and death battle with the dark wizard... 
COACH HARVEY ...Fall in, Freedman. Hurry up. 
Ed takes a spot next to Dom. 
PHOTOGRPAHER And 3, 2, 1- 
WE see Dom reach behind Ed, grab hold of his underwear...RRRRIIIPP...FLASH. And with the flash WE cut to: 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT 
The Falcons run, pass and shoot on one end of the court.    On the opposite end, a TEAM in BLUE warms up. 
Lights dim. Cue MC Hammer's `Can't Touch This'. CHEERLEADERS at center court perform the Hammer DANCE ROUTINE. PAN around the gym, everybody's doing the Hammer dance. 
Ed awkwardly tries to imitate Mike. 
Coach shakes his head in disgust and when the routine ends- 
COACH HARVEY Alright, Ladies, bring it in! 
The Falcons swarm to the bench, take seats.     Ed hands waters to the Players, skips Dom, stops at Mike. 
Mike yanks his tie straight up as if he were hanging himself. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - MORNING 
ED FREEDMAN, now 36, lies on a portable table in his boxers. ACUPUNCTURE NEEDLES protrude from every inch of his body, neck and face...at least 5000 needles. 
A HOT, YOUNG ACUPUNCTURIST adds more to him. 
ACUPUNCTURIST Can you feel your Qi flowing freely? 
ED I'm not sure if its my Qi or internal bleeding. 
Mike enters, shakes his head in amusement. 
MIKE What are you doing now? 
Ed looks over, sees Mike watching. 
ED There he is. There's Mr. Sunshine. Fei Jing Acupuncture. It's all the rage. Makes you look five years younger. 
Ed climbs slowly off the table, shuffles over, groaning in pain the entire way. He pours himself a shot of BROWN LIQUID from a pitcher, throws the shot back and immediately SPITS it all over the place. 
ED (CONT'D) (calls to Acupuncturist) What's this brown stuff again? 
ACUPUNCTURIST Rhinoceros urine. Pure protein. 
ED Delish! (to Mike) The girl has absolutely no clue what she's doing. 
MIKE Then why are you letting her stick needles in you? 
ED Because she's hot. But today's not about me. It's about you becoming the new regional sales manager. 
MIKE I better be. I've invested 18 years of my life in that miserable company. 
ED No negativity. Negativity's for the 800 pound fat lady who needs to be airlifted out of bed. You, Michael Shawn O'Donnell, are a winner. 
MIKE A winner doesn't have to crash at his best friend's house because he was kicked out of his own house. 
ED Are you kidding?! It doesn't get any better than this! (MORE) 
ED (CONT'D) I gotta get back. My legs just went numb. Good luck today. 
Ed drags painfully back to the Acupuncturist. 
EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY - MORNING 
Mike wheels his Audi A4 below a nondescript, two level building. Sign reads, `Wyatt Pharmaceuticals'. 
INT. WYATT PHARMACEUTICALS/CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING 
PHARMACEUTICAL DRUG POSTERS cover the walls.    Smiling faces, happy couples...little pills. 
Surrounding a conference table are Mike's colleagues...HOT WOMEN, 20 to 35, in skimpy business suits, chatting away. 
Mike sits amongst them, the only male present. A glum look on his face. WENDY, bubbly, ditsy, 22, leans over to him. 
WENDY Congratulations, Mike. You deserve it. You're like a totally amazing salesman. 
MIKE Thanks, Wendy. That like totally means so much to me. 
ROGER, 23, boss, strides through the door. 
ROGER Good morning, peeps. As you all know, today I'll be naming the new regional sales manager. What's it take to be an RSM? Leadership skills, a comprehensive knowledge of today's prescription pharmaceuticals and most importantly a dedicated soldier. 
Mike straightens his tie, buttons his suit jacket. 
ROGER (CONT'D) All being said, congratulations- (Mike begins to rise) Wendy. 
Dumbfounded, Mike slumps back into his seat.    Wendy springs up out of hers, SCREAMING and BOUNCING. 
ROGER (CONT'D) Now go out there and sell some drugs peeps! 
The Women stream out. 
MIKE How could you do this to me? I've been a salesman here 18 years. Wendy's only been here 2 months!? 
They make their way towards the door.    Mike limping. 
ALEX Why are you limping? 
MIKE Tweaked my back pumping iron. Really, really heavy iron. 
INT. CHEESECAKE FACTORY - NIGHT 
Mike, Alex and Maggie sit before dinner.    Alex eats heartily. Maggie quietly pushes her food around. 
MIKE I bet your chompin' at the bit for hoop season to start. 
ALEX Yeah, me and the guys are running drills, scrimmaging, getting in shape. 
Maggie stifles a laugh. 
MIKE That's my boy. Remember, it's not how big you are- 
ALEX -it's how big you play. 
Father and Son touch fists. 
MIKE And what about you, Mags?   What's new? 
MAGGIE Nothing. 
ALEX She got into Georgetown. 
MIKE You did!?    That's fantastic! 
MAGGIE It's no big deal. 
MIKE It's a huge deal. That's a great university. I'm proud of you. (Maggie remains quiet) Am I missing something here? 
MAGGIE You wouldn't understand. 
MIKE Try me. 
MAGGIE I have a lot of emotional stress right now. My friends are all going to different schools, I'm not even sure... 
MIKE That's not stress. Wait `til you get out into the real world, get a crappy job, have some smarmy twerp- boss calling you bro-ski... 
Maggie rolls her eyes. 
ALEX Did you get the promotion, Dad? 
MIKE Still waiting to hear. 
Mike forces a smile hiding his disappointment. 
EXT. SAN FERNANDO VALLEY/MIKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Mike pulls up behind a `Dom's Nursery' van. He, Alex and Maggie step out. Mike eyes the van with disdain. 
MIKE Is your mom home? 
ALEX She's probably out back. 
MIKE Hey, next week we'll have a barbecue at Uncle Ed's. Sound good? 
MAGGIE I'm counting down the minutes. 
Maggie heads straight for the modest ranch house and inside. 
MIKE What's with her? 
ALEX We see you once a week for a couple hours. What do you expect? 
Alex follows Maggie into the house.   Mike makes his way around back. 
EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY 
As Mike rounds the corner, he almost runs into a smiling Dom Johnson, 36. Don lugs 3 loaded trash bags. 
DOM Hey, Mike. Good to see you.    Tough break, you and Scarlet. 
INT. MIKE'S AUDI - NIGHT 
A somber Mike drives alongside the Los Angeles River. An old song plays low on the radio...static...then...BOOM. THUNDER roars scaring Mike and literally shaking the Audi. SPLASH. RAIN drops in buckets. 
MIKE Jesus! 
Mike turns the wipers on high. Not much help. He slows the car to a crawl, straining to see out the windshield. 
LIGHTNING flashes. We see the Janitor leaning over the railing looking into the raging river. Mike brakes, throws his door open, jumps out into the pouring rain. 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
MIKE Hey!?     Get away from there!? 
Mike, blinded by the rain makes his way to the railing. The Janitor's GONE. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Oh no!!   Hello!? 
Mike leans over the rickety railing, looks down... 
The phosphorescent water swirls angrily...rising quickly. It's mesmerizing. Magical. Mike can't take his eyes off- 
LIGHTENING FLASHES Mike's 17 year-old face reflection stares back up at him. 
MIKE (CONT'D) What the- 
CRACK. The railing BREAKS.    Mike FALLS...SPLASH...headlong into the river. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ED'S HOUSE - NEXT MORNING 
Mike's Audi rolls into the driveway. The door swings open. A muddy, shoeless foot steps out followed by a shoed foot but in no better shape. 
WE follow the feet, tattered slacks dragging on the cement, to the door. 2 filthy hands dig into pockets, searching- 
MIKE Damn it. (pushes doorbell) Ed! Ed! I lost my key! 
INT. ED'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Ed, wrapped in a robe, tissue between his toes, wobbles to the door so as not to mess up his freshly polished nails. 
ED Coming!   I've been worried sick! WHERE- 
Ed opens the door...standing before him is Mike, covered in MUD. His ripped, grimy suit now hangs off of him because...HE'S 17 AGAIN. 
Ed's eyes widen with FEAR. 
MIKE I've had a really rough night. 
ED AAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!! 
Ed slams the door, frantically wobbles away. The door opens, ANGLE ON the muddy feet as they enter and follow the trail of cotton balls up the stairs and to the bathroom door. 
INT. BATHROOM - DAY 
ANGLE ON Ed cowering against the back wall, brandishing an over-sized loofah. The door slowly swings open. Ed gasps- 
ED Don't come any closer!    I'll use it! 
MIKE What are you gonna do? Exfoliate me to death? (Ed shrieks) You got into my samples case again, didn't you? 
A whimpering Ed points to the mirror. 
MIKE (CONT'D) What's your problem, it's only mud. 
The muddy feet turn toward the mirror and- 
MIKE (CONT'D) AAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!! 
ANGLE ON the mirror. Mike's 17. He turns on the water, splashes his face frantically. Mud gone. He's still 17. 
MIKE (CONT'D) AHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! 
Mike tears his suit jacket and shirt off...hairless chest. He yanks off his pants, peeks down his boxers- 
A FEMALE JANITOR, steps from a room. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Excuse me! Excuse me!? Can you tell me where I can find the night janitor? 
JANITOR I'm the only custodial engineer currently employed here. 
MIKE There was an old guy, white hair. I showed him this picture of me- 
Mike points to the 1989 team photo. 
JANITOR -Of you?   That picture's from 1989. 
Mike backs away from the picture and the Janitor. 
MIKE Right.   Forget it. 
Confused, Mike stumbles to the bathroom. He's about to enter, three letter jacket wearing JOCKS, STAN, JAZZ and KEVIN, burst out laughing, knocking Mike on the way by. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/BATHROOM - DAY 
Mike enters, moves to a sink, turns the water on- 
VOICE (o.s.) Can I get a little help in here? 
Mike turns, sees what appears to be UNDERWEAR stretched over the corner of a closed stall door. 
Mike approaches the door, swings it open...there HANGS Alex, sneakers dangling 3 feet off the ground. The back of his underwear wrenched up over the corner of the door. 
MIKE Alex?   What are you doing up there? 
ALEX I wanted to see if I could get my nuts into my esophagus. What do you think I'm doing!? Get me down! 
MIKE Okay.   Okay. I'll get you down. 
Mike pulls the underwear off the door.   Alex drops, reaches down his pants, adjusts his underwear. 
ALEX How do you know my name? 
MIKE I'm...Mark...Freedman. Your Uncle Ed's son. He told me to look out for you. 
ALEX Uncle Ed has a son? 
MIKE Believe me, it's gonna be a surprise to him too. Did those guys do this to you? 
ALEX Goons from the basketball team. 
MIKE But why? 
ALEX Because they can and so they do on a daily basis. 
MIKE (SHOCKED) But you're one of them. 
ALEX No, I'm not. Nice robe, guy. Gotta go. 
Alex walks out bowlegged.   A devastated Mike watches him go. 
INT. AUDI - MOMENTS LATER 
Mike drives off out of the parking lot. To his left he spies- ANGLE ON: Stan and Maggie making out against Stan's Mustang. 
Mike pounds on the horn, scaring them apart.   Drive's off. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Ed sits at the island, a laptop in front of him. On the screen WE see he's perusing www.spellscursesincantations.com. 
The sound of the front door opening and closing. Mike enters. 
ED Did you find the janitor? 
MIKE He doesn't exist.   Nothing makes sense. 
ED Did he ask you for your soul? 
MIKE No? 
ED Before we get started I want you to know that Mark's a bastard. 
JULIE Excuse me!? 
ED I had him out of wedlock.   So the answer is yes, I'm very single...and very rich. 
MIKE Dad met mom in Thailand. She's a very successful prostitute. 
Ed's smile fades. 
JULIE O-Kay. Did you bring your transcripts? 
Mike hands Julie the folder. As Julie browses through it, Ed and Mike get into a pinching, elbowing fight. When she looks up, the friends stop. Both smiling. 
JULIE (CONT'D) So the last school you went to was Cutler High in Connecticut. And you were a straight A student. Very impressive. 
ED I help him with his homework...a lot. 
MIKE Oh, dad, the doctor called.     You were right. It is herpes. 
Ed's jaw drops.   Julie rises abruptly. 
JULIE I think it's time we got Mark to class. Lisa! Lisa! 
The door opens, in steps LISA, 18. 
JULIE (CONT'D) Lisa, will you print out a schedule for Mark and show him to class? 
LISA Sure.   Come on, Mark. 
Mike stands.   Ed addresses him as fatherly as he knows how- 
ED Be a good boy now.   And sit up straight. 
Mike glares at Ed, follows Lisa out.    Ed turns to Julie. 
ED (CONT'D) They grow up so fast. Mojito? 
JULIE I beg your pardon. 
ED You strike me as a Mojito gal. I know this little Cuban place, great PLANTAINS- 
JULIE -Yeah, no. I don't date my students' parents. It's a rule of mine. 
ED I'll enroll him somewhere else. 
JULIE I really need to get back to work. 
Julie ushers Ed to the door. 
ED See you at the next bake sale then? 
Julie shuts the door, shakes her head in disbelief. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY 
Mike steps in. Scattered giggles at his appearance. Mike takes a seat, eyes three sexy girls wearing next to nothing, SAMANTHA, LAUREN and JAMIE, busy texting on their phones. 
MIKE Do their mothers know they dress like that? 
A GIRL next to him leans over- 
GIRL Those are the Wonder Bras.    Beware. 
The Jocks, Stan, Jazz and Kevin strut in. Mike's eyes narrow. Stan stops before Mike, looks him up and down- 
STAN What did you did do? Mug the mannequin at the Ed Hardy store? 
JAZZ Tool! 
Laughter from the class. Mike shies. The Jocks sit, Stan behind Mike. Just as the last bell rings, Maggie rushes in, sits with the Bras. 
MAGGIE Oh thank God he's not here.    I ran all the way from- 
Something catches Maggie's eye.   It's Mike waving to her. 
Mike nods, continues on past the snickering and catcalls until he sees Maggie and the Wonder Bras. 
ANGLE: Wonder Bra Table. Maggie, Samantha, Jamie and Lauren pick around plates of cafeteria food. 
MAGGIE What's the big deal? He stuck up for me in class. It was a nice thing to do. 
SAMANTHA He was totally sexing on you. 
LAUREN He's coming. Pretend you're not here. 
Mike approaches, big smile. The Wonder Bras look off in every direction except Mike's. 
MIKE Hi, Maggie. Hi, girls.     I'm Mark- 
The Girls continue looking away, ignoring Mike. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Girls?    Hello? Anyone home? 
LAUREN Oh my God.     Can't you see we're not here? 
MIKE Good.    So there's plenty of room then. 
Mike drops down next to Samantha and across from Maggie. 
JAMIE Oh, look. He brought a bag lunch. How sped. (special ed) 
Mike hides his lunch. 
SAMANTHA Look, this table is V.I.P.     You're a NIP. 
MIKE What's a NIP? 
LAUREN Not Important. Go away. 
MIKE Maggie, why are you friends with these horrible girls? 
MAGGIE Listen, I appreciate what you did in class but, I already have a boyfriend. 
MIKE You have a boyfriend? (his phone rings) Excuse me a second. 
Mike pulls out an OLDER Blackberry phone, looks at the caller ID...Scarlet. He sends it to voice mail. 
JAMIE He still gets calls.    How 2007. 
SAMANTHA I think my grandfather has that phone. 
MIKE Maggie, could we talk somewhere ELSE- 
The sound of a bouncing ball interrupts. 
MALE VOICE (o.s.) Yo! 
Mike turns.   Stan, Jazz and Kevin swagger over. 
STAN Bro-ski, what are you doing at our table? 
MAGGIE Nothing.   He was just leaving. 
Maggie nods for Mike to go. 
MIKE (SARCASTIC) We should do this again sometime. 
Mike stands. Stan pulls Maggie up, starts making out with her, hands all over her. WE can see Mike's blood BOIL until- 
MIKE (CONT'D) Get your hands off her, you little punk! 
Oops. Stan stops groping, steps over to Mike, a solid foot taller than him. 
STAN You gotta problem with me, `bra? 
Mike looks around...the entire cafeteria watches.   Defeated- 
MIKE No, no, I don't. 
Stan takes Mike's hat off, picks up an ice cream from Maggie's tray, puts the ice cream in the hat, places it back on Mike's head and SMUSHES it down. 
The Boys gather a stack of TEEN MAGAZINES and TABLOID RAGS. Ed slips a MELONS Magazine into the pile. 
INT. TRENDY HAIR SALON - NIGHT 
A picture of a YOUNG, POPULAR STAR torn from one of the teen mags hangs on the mirror. 
A HAIRDRESSER cuts away and highlights Mike's long locks.     Ed sits beside Mike sipping wine, enjoying a manicure. 
INT. TRENDY CLOTHES STORE - NIGHT 
It's the PRETTY WOMAN scene. 2 hip SALESGIRLS pull clothes from racks. A clean cut Mike tries on sneakers, jeans, T- shirts, hoodies, shirts, jewelry. Ed nods with his approval or disapproval. 
At the register, the Girls hand Mike his bags of clothes.     Ed takes out his cell to put their numbers in it. The Girls frown and go back to work. 
INT. VIRGIN MEGA MUSIC STORE - NIGHT 
Mike and Ed stand before the wall of 100 top albums.   Both wear headphones listening and moving to the music. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/OFFICE - NIGHT 
Mike and Ed, surrounded by the magazines and music discs, sit before the computer. Ed TEACHES Mike how to create a MYSPACE page. 
Bogus About Me and Interests. Photoshopped pictures of Mike in exotic locations. All the `now' movies, music and books. They fill his Friends section with only hot girls. 
The Boys view the flashy, finished product, tap fists.   This page makes `Mark Freedman' look like a playboy. 
INT. MAC STORE - NIGHT 
A SALESMAN hands a smiling Mike his new iPhone. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Mike sits on the bed, types away on his laptop. A knock on the door. Mike looks up and YELLS. Ed stands in the doorway, his entire body and head wrapped in SEAWEED. 
ED Before you ask, it's a seaweed wrap. I'm detoxifying as well as losing an inch or 2 from my problem areas. 
MIKE There must be a very hot girl downstairs. 
ED There is.    What are you doing? 
MIKE I forwarded my calls to my new phone, sent some work emails and just lobbed one to Scarlet, told her I was in Peru finding myself. Think she'll buy it? 
ED Probably not because when she called earlier I told her you were being detained at Guantanamo. Ready for tomorrow? 
MIKE I am so ready. 
Ed flips Mike a set of keys.     Mike's eyes light up. 
ED That ought'a put you over the top. And don't forget to hook me up son. 
Ed plods off.   Off Mike's huge smile. 
EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - MORNING 
The usual pre-school ritual. Stan, Jazz, Kevin, the Wonder Bras and Maggie all hang around Stan's `stang. 
Stan and Maggie wrapped in a heated embrace, kissing. 
HONK.   A horn blares.    Stan and Maggie jump out of the way. 
An ASTON MARTIN VANQUISH stops next to the crew. The tinted window rolls down revealing the new and improved Mike. 
Mike winks then rolls on past. 
SAMANTHA Oh my god.     Was that- 
JAMIE Did you see- 
LAUREN I told you he was cute. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY 
It's the MOMENT.   Mike walks the hallway, handsome and hip. 
Samantha, Lauren and Jamie text by their lockers.    Mike struts up to them. The Bras smile. 
SCARLET You wouldn't have. It was a disaster back here a few days ago. Obviously I have a lot to do still. I'm laying the sod next and the limestone pathway will go here. 
Scarlet moves about the yard, pointing and explaining. 
SCARLET (CONT'D) Then I'll plant all those, over a hundred different types of flowers and plants. I have an amazing fountain being delivered that'll go here and a bench over there. (MORE) 
SCARLET (CONT'D) And I'll string rows of tiny, white lights above it all so every night will be a starry one. It'll be a real sanctuary back here. 
MIKE It seems like a lot'a work for one person, Scar. 
A chill runs up Scarlet's spine. 
SCARLET My husband's the only one that ever calls me that. 
Alex appears at the doors interrupting- 
ALEX Yo, Mark.    Let's do this. 
MIKE Good luck with the project. 
SCARLET Nice to meet you. And, Alex, be home by 10:30. 
Mike heads back inside.   Scarlet stares after him. 
INT. ASTON MARTIN - NIGHT 
Mike and Alex step in. 
MIKE How's your mom doing? You know, with your dad not being around and all. 
ALEX She doesn't like to show it but I know she's bummed. I think it bothers her more that he hasn't called me or Maggie in a while. Whatever. 
BEEP. BEEP. Mike pulls out his iPhone, text message from Samantha. It reads: 
SAMANTHA'S TEXT Wat^? mobinit 2 zuma. soi! but w/e. brb. bk. gtg. ttyl. xo. sam. 
Mike stares at the screen as if it were in hieroglyphics. 
MIKE I have no idea what this says? 
Alex takes the phone from Mike, reads- 
ALEX It says `What up? Mobbing it to Zuma. So over it but whatever. Be right back. Back. Got to go. Talk to you later. kiss, hug. Sam. 
MIKE Let's hit the beach, wingman. 
The two touch fists. 
EXT. ZUMA BEACH - NIGHT 
A BONFIRE illuminates the night sky. MUSIC plays. KIDS lay on blankets, play football. Others splash in the ocean. 
WE find Maggie and the Wonder Bras seated by the fire. 
SAMANTHA We were on his myspace page. There's a picture of him jamming with the Chili Peppers at Coachella. 
JAMIE I heard Timbaland wants to produce an album with him. 
LAUREN Yeah, but he turned him down to help orphans with Brangelina in Nambib-ib-bib...in Africa. 
SAMANTHA Oh my God!     I bet he knows Justin. 
ANGLE: Mike and a nervous Alex make their way down the sand. 
ALEX This looks boring. Let's go back to my house and play video games. 
Alex turns.   Mike grabs his arm, turns him back. 
MIKE What are you so nervous about? 
ALEX The beach is for the older, cool kids. I don't belong here. 
MIKE What are you talking about? You're a basketball player. You're cool. 
ALEX I don't play basketball. I mean, I can play, I just don't play on the team. 
NICOLE Oh my God!     Seriously!? 
Alex rips a huge BURP.    The Girls duck for cover. 
GIRL 1 I think he got some on me! 
ALEX Wait. I'm sorry. I'm just real nervous and I've wanted to talk to you for so long. And Mark told me to compliment you on something you never get complimented on but I couldn't find anything because everything's so...perfect. 
Nicole and her Friends MELT. 
NICOLE Do you want to sit down, Nicole? 
Nicole scoots over making room next to her.    Alex smiles. 
ANGLE: Mike sits down beside Maggie. 
MAGGIE What do you want? 
MIKE Stan.   Why are you dating him? 
MAGGIE Get to the point why don't you? 
MIKE I'm serious. He's not a nice guy. Matter of fact he's a jackass. 
MAGGIE Don't talk about him like that. You don't even know him. 
MIKE I know he bullies your brother. 
MAGGIE Stan barely knows Alex exists. We're moving in together after graduation. 
MIKE Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I thought you were going to Georgetown? 
MAGGIE I'm going to Westwood Community College. Stan and I both are. 
Mike loses it, leaps to his feet shouting- 
MIKE The hell you are, Young Lady! If you think I'm gonna let you throw your life away on some Sleestack you're crazy! I forbid you to see him anymore and that's final! 
Maggie jumps up.   Kids all stare. 
MAGGIE Who do you think you are!?   My father?! 
Maggie stomps over to the still bickering Bras. 
MIKE Don't you walk away from me, Margaret Sarah O'Donnell! 
Maggie and the Bras turn towards Mike and glare.   Maggie heads for the parking lot. 
SAMANTHA Who's Margaret? 
LAUREN He doesn't even know her name. 
JAMIE He's so not into her. 
The Bras make the `text me' sign then hurry after Maggie. 
Mike kicks angrily at the sand and accidentally into the faces of a group of KIDS. 
EXT. ED'S HOUSE/POOL - MORNING 
A HOT GIRL wearing a `Lifeguard' bathing suit sits atop a high chair. 
Ed floats on a raft. A frozen drink next to him.    Scarlet looms over him, the 2 in a heated conversation- 
SCARLET I haven't heard from him in three weeks. Obviously he doesn't care. 
ED He cares. 
SCARLET Then where is he? 
Mike steps from the house, sees Scarlet- 
MIKE What's going on? 
SCARLET Nothing, Mark. I was just dropping something off. 
STAN Stuck!!!   I'm stuck!   My fingers! 
Stan stands, hunched...the CHAIR GLUED to his butt. The DESK ATTACHED to his forearm and his FINGERS STUCK to his nose. 
The Kids and Mike burst out laughing, break out their video phones as Stan fumbles around, dragging the desk, PANICKING. 
MR. ADAMS Sit down, Stan! Sit down! 
STAN It's glue! I'm glued to everything! 
Jazz bounds out of his seat, grabs hold of Stan's wrist. 
JAZZ I'll get it off! 
STAN No!    No!   Don't pull--! 
RRRRIIIIPPPP.    Jazz yanks.   Stan's SCREAM echoes. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY 
Mike, wearing basketball gear and bouncing a basketball, stands in the middle of the court. Alex enters. 
ALEX I got your text.     What's so important? 
MIKE This year you're making the team. We practice everyday `til try outs. That gives us a week and a half. 
ALEX Forget it. 
MIKE Yeah, you're right. You probably don't have any skills anyway. 
Mike begins to walk out. 
ALEX Hey!     I got skills. 
Mike turns back. 
MIKE So what's your problem?      Is it Stan and his friends? 
ALEX Just leave it alone. 
MIKE You don't need to be afraid of them, Alex. 
ALEX I'm too small anyway. 
MIKE That's why we focus on your speed, dribbling and outside shot. Remember, it's not how big you are- 
ALEX -it's how big you play. (QUIZZICALLY) Where did you hear that? 
MIKE (COVERS) I don't know? Read it somewhere I guess. Be a sport. Show me what you got. 
Mike tosses Alex the ball. Alex begins to dribble. Mike steps up to defend. Alex dribbles quicker, through his legs. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Alright.   You got a little game. 
WHAM. The doors slam open. In walk Stan and his Posse.     A BLOOD speckled BAND-AID covers the tip of Stan's nose. 
STAN What are you 2 queers doing in my gym? 
MIKE Let's go, Alex. 
Alex stops dribbling. He and Mike move towards the door. Stan and his Posse block the way. 
STAN I don't think so. You girls wanna play with the boys then let's play. 2 on 2. 
MIKE We'll save you the embarrassment for try-outs. 
Stan takes the ball from Alex, turns his back, dribbles. 
STAN Come on, Ally. Embarrass me. 
While dribbling, Stan moves backwards, bumping into Alex's midsection, forcing Alex back. 
MIKE Back off, Stan. 
Alex takes a deep breath, tired of being afraid- 
ED I haven't heard from him, really. 
Scarlet looks down, fights back tears, unravels a bit... 
SCARLET Okay. If you do, please have him call home. For the kids...I'm running out of excuses- 
ED I'll tell him.    I promise. 
Scarlet forces a smile. Mike watches her go. For the first time he's seen HER REALITY...hurt, pain, frustration. Mike places his head sadly in his hands. 
Julie the Principal pokes her head out the door. 
JULIE Ed, come on in. 
Ed whispers to Mike. 
ED I'll take it from here. 
As Ed passes Julie on the way in- 
ED (CONT'D) I'm heartbroken. The boy's incorrigible. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY 
Ed takes a seat across from Julie, puts on his best `troubled parent' look. 
JULIE Look, if it was only one isolated fight it wouldn't distress me all that much. Boys will be boys. But, it's also been brought to my attention that Mark may have Krazy glued a boy to his chair. 
Ed stifles a laugh, puts on a serious face. 
ED My son?     Mark!   Get in here!   Now! 
Mike slouches in, takes a seat. 
ED (CONT'D) Did you glue a boy to his chair? 
MIKE No. 
Ed throws his hands up in exasperation. 
ED See? The boy's out of control. He's acting up at home. He won't eat his vegetables- 
MIKE                                 ED He shaves his back.                He sucks his thumb. 
MIKE                                ED He wears girls underwear.          He wets his bed. 
JULIE Enough! Mark, I know it's hard to be the new kid but if I have anymore trouble from you, you'll be facing detentions or worse. You can go now. 
Mike nods, exits.   Ed stands and with exaggerated sadness- 
ED He's crying out for help and I don't know what to do. It hurts so bad. Maybe we could discuss this over margaritas? 
JULIE Let's give him time to figure it out on his own. If the situation gets worse then we'll take the next step. 
ED You're the expert. I'm just a single dad out here blowing like dust in the wind. 
Ed shakes Julie's hand and exits, sniffling. 
EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY 
A dirt covered Scarlet wrestles a roll of sod down. 
MIKE (o.s.) Got an extra pair of gloves? 
Scarlet peers over her shoulder...Mike wanders in.    Scarlet stands, wipes her bare, dirty hands on her jeans. 
SCARLET Gloves are for sissies. 
MIKE Yeah, but I just had a manicure. 
SCARLET (LAUGHS) You're serious? You want to help? 
MIKE Are you kidding? I love landscaping! (MORE) 
MIKE (CONT'D) It's right up there with watching "Sex and the City" and snuggling. 
MAGGIE You're so sweet. 
ANGLE ON Maggie's face.       She's SMITTEN. 
MONTAGE OF LIFE

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY

Maggie turns from the chalkboard and smiles flirtatiously at Mike. Stan catches this exchange and pops the back of Mike's head. 
EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT 
Lights shine down. Alex stands behind the 3 point line. Mike feeds him balls. Alex shoots and moves. Shoots and moves. More misses than hits.

INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/CALCULUS CLASS - DAY 
A muffled buzz. Mike reaches into his pocket, pulls out his phone. A PIX MESSAGE. Mike opens it. A close up of perfect CLEAVAGE. 
Mike peeks over his shoulder...the Wonder Bras text on their phones. He's confused until- 
-Mike turns a little more in his seat...MAGGIE smiles seductively at him, blows a kiss. Mike GASPS, spins back around...TRAUMATIZED. 
EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY 
Scarlet fills holes with plants then waters them with a hose. She turns, finds Mike SLEEPING in the grass. Scarlet picks up the hose, TURNS IT ON HIM. Mike leaps up, chases her. 
EXT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - DAY 
Mike, Alex, Nicole, Maggie, the Bras and a slew of KIDS hang by Mike's Aston. Stan, Jazz and Kevin are all that's left by Stan's Mustang.

Alex scampers through the maze of cones, dribbling from hand to hand...and does it perfectly. Mike and Alex high 5. 
EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - DAY 
Mike and Scarlet lug an ornate, wooden bench to it's spot. They sit. Mike casually places a hand on Scarlet's leg. Scarlet casually removes it. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY 
A game of 1 on 1. Alex dribbles up to Mike. Mike crouches in a defensive stance. Mike goes for the ball. Alex crosses over. Mike misses. Alex pulls up, shoots and scores. Mike smiles, shakes his head. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - DAY 
Again, Mike and Ed sit before Julie. She hands Ed a slip of paper...3 detentions. Ed chokes back crocodile tears. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/HALL - DAY 
Mike places books in his locker, shuts the door revealing...a goo goo eyed Maggie. Mike startles and RUNS. Maggie chases. 
INT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY 
Alex stands behind the 3 point line. Mike rapidly feeds him balls. Alex catches, shoots and moves. This time...they're all going in. Mike passes the last ball. Alex shoots and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - DAY 
JULIE You're disgusting, Ed. 
ED What? You don't like Beluga?     You can get something else. 
JULIE I'm not some 22 year-old who you can impress with caviar and expensive wine. 
ED Would the caviar and expensive wine impress you if you were on a yacht off Monte Carlo? 
JULIE I came here because I'm concerned about the wellbeing of your son but you don't care about Mark. All you're concerned with is proving to me how wealthy you are. 
ED I do care about Mike...Mark. Whatever his name is. 
JULIE You know what's too bad, Ed? I'm sure when you were the guy the boys picked on and the girls ignored you were really sweet. (MORE) 
JULIE (CONT'D) But you thought becoming rich would solve all your problems. Instead it made you just like them. I have to go. 
Julie rises.   Ed takes her wrist. 
ED Wait. You're right. I'm acting like an idiot. I'm sorry. Please stay. 
Julie begrudgingly sits back down. 
JULIE Act normal or I'm leaving. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON Mike's face, eyes shut. A hand gently strokes his head. Mike stirs awake, smiles, eyes still closed- 
MIKE I had the craziest dream. I was 17 again and back in high school. It was horrible, Scarlet- 
MAGGIE (o.s.) Scarlet!? 
Mike's eyes pop open. WIDER reveals Mike and Maggie on the bed. Mike's head rests on Maggie's lap. 
Mike JUMPS off the bed, scrambles to the other side of the room and behind a chair. Maggie leaps off the bed. 
MAGGIE (CONT'D) You wanna play? Okay, let's play. I'm the hungry lioness and you're a baby gazelle. 
Maggie ROARS, chases Mike around the room. 
MIKE Wait! This is highly inappropriate and dysfunctional. Listen to me, Maggie. I'm your father. 
Maggie growls, stalks Mike around the bed. 
MAGGIE And I've been a bad, bad girl, Daddy. 
Maggie dives across the bed.    Mike dodges, runs out the door. 
EXT. ED'S HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT 
Alex and Nicole sit closely by a fire pit, laughing. 
ALEX How about Mrs. Cruz? Every time she rolls her r's she spits all over me. 
Alex imitates Mrs. Cruz. Nicole laughs, places her hand on Alex's leg. Alex looks down at her hand, then up at her, both staring at one another...THE MOMENT. 
Nicole closes her eyes, moves in. Alex moves in then FREAKS. He bounds out of his chair, sprints inside leaving Nicole hanging. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
A distraught Alex pushes his way through the insanity.   He finds Mike running down the stairs. 
ALEX Mike, I blew it!     I totally blew it! 
MIKE Blew what?     What happened? 
ALEX She wanted me to kiss her but I panicked. I didn't know if I should close my eyes or which way to turn my head or how much tongue I'm supposed to use- 
MIKE Slow down. Have you ever kissed a girl before? 
ALEX Not a real one. I used to practice on my dad's Playboys. 
MIKE How did you find...forget it. It's easy. All you have to do is take her face in your hands gently like THIS- 
Mike places a hand gently on either side of Alex's face. 
CLOSE ON a Heavy Kid leans over the pool PUKING. Wider...Mike beside him while Kids cheer the Heavy Kid on. 
MIKE I'm so dead. 
Mike turns, finds SCARLET making her way through the crowd. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Oh no! 
Mike rushes over to her. 
MIKE (CONT'D) Scarlet, what are you doing here? 
SCARLET I'm looking for Alex. It's past his curfew and he wasn't picking up his phone. Is he here? 
MIKE Yeah, he's fine.   He's with his girlfriend. 
SCARLET Alex has a girlfriend? 
MIKE He does and she's really cute. Come on. 
Mike leads Scarlet away from the pool. 
INT. FERRARI - NIGHT 
Ed and Julie drive through the upscale neighborhood. 
JULIE How did you get your hands on the 5th edition? That's not due out for another three years. 
ED I have two words for you.    Russian mafia. 
JULIE Drive faster. 
He steps on the gas. He fishtails around a corner. Cars pack Ed's street and driveway. Boys and girls trample the front lawn. One BOY urinates in a flower bed. 
JULIE (CONT'D) Calm thyself, Marius. 
ED That little-!   I'll kill him! 
Ed double parks the car, jumps out. 
EXT. ED'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ed storms up the driveway.    Julie hurries after him.   A KID spies Julie, calls out- 
KID It's Ms. Goodwin!    Run! 
All the Kids on the lawn SCATTER in different directions. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Ed and Julie enter the crowded, loud room. Kids dance, stomp around on the furniture. A furious Ed screams- 
ED Everybody out!   Get out!   Get out! 
Nobody flinches.   Julie WHISTLES loudly.   The Kids stop. 
JULIE This party is over! If you don't want to spend the next 3 months in detention you will leave...now! 
The Kids BEELINE for the door.    Ed stops a GIRL. 
ED Do you know where Mark Freedman is? 
GIRL I think I saw him go outside. 
SPLAT. A slice of pizza falls from the ceiling onto Ed's head. The Girl laughs, exits. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Maggie enters, weeds through the crowd, bumps into the Bras. 
MAGGIE Have you seen Mark? 
SAMANTHA We're looking for him too. 
Maggie scowls, heads for the back door.     The Bras chase. 
Alex and Nicole march past.    Mike reaches for Alex's arm. Alex pulls it away. 
MIKE Alex, wait. Let me explain- 
ALEX How could you do this to me? 
Alex whisks Nicole into the house.   Mike lowers his head.    Ed stomps over, grabs Mike. 
ED This place is a disaster! A kid pissed all over my English garden! What were you thinking!? 
MIKE She hates me, Ed.    I've ruined everything. 
Mike runs for the house.   Julie looks quizzically to Ed. 
JULIE Who hates him? What's going on? 
Ed shifts uncomfortably, takes a deep breath. 
ED Oh boy. I don't quite know how to put this. 
JULIE Try being honest. 
ED He's not really my son.    I don't have a son. 
SLAP.   Ed looks like he's about to cry. 
JULIE Mark's obviously having a crisis and you...you insensitive bastard, you disown him? He'd be better off with his mother in Thailand. 
Julie strides for the house.     Ed yells after her- 
ED Should I call you?! 
EXT. ED'S HOUSE - MORNING 
All is normal.   No signs of a party. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/HALLWAY - MORNING 
Ed knocks and knocks on Mike's bedroom door. 
ED Come on.   It's been 2 days.    Open up. 
WE hear a dragging sound then...CLICK.     Ed turns the knob, opens the door, enters. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Dark.   Mike climbs back into bed.   Ed waves at the air. 
ED Jesus. It smells like Jeffrey Dahmer's kitchen in here. 
Ed pulls up the blinds, opens the windows. A disheveled, Mike groans, rolls away from the light. Ed sits on the bed. 
ED (CONT'D) Are you alright? 
MIKE I really messed up.    I've lost my family. 
ED That's not true.      Nothing's ever truly lost. 
MIKE What about you and Julie? 
ED Oh, that?    That's lost. 
MIKE Sorry about the party.      I'll pay for any damages. 
ED Don't worry about it. My spa guy got the last of the vomit out of the pool so we're good. I don't mean to rub salt in your wounds but- 
Ed holds up the manila envelope of divorce papers. 
ED (CONT'D) -you're due in court in an hour. 
A look of determination comes over Mike's face. 
EXT. ED'S HOUSE - DAY 
The BMW roars out of the garage, Ed driving, tears down the driveway, fishtailing onto the street, LOSES CONTROL, rips across a neighbor's lawn then back onto the road and off. 
A tearful Scarlet starts to leave, stops, picks up Mike's `letter'...DIRECTIONS TO THE COURTHOUSE. She looks back confused. 
INT. BMW CONVERTIBLE - DAY 
A solemn Mike stares out the window.    Ed turns the radio off. 
ED Maybe it wasn't a spell of enlightenment. 
Mike looks to Ed. 
MIKE What are you talking about? 
ED According to the website once you've learned your lesson you'd turn back. That speech should've broken the spell. 
MIKE Enough with the magic crap, Ed. 
ED You know what this means? You need to let them go. You need to let them get on with their lives and you need to get on with yours. 
Mike chokes back tears...because he knows Ed is right. 
INT. ED'S HOUSE/MIKE'S BEDROOM - DUSK 
Mike works on his laptop, plugs his iPhone into it...downloads pictures. 
Mike moves to the bed, packs his Falcons uniform into a duffel bag. A BEEP. Mike unplugs the iPhone, types an email to Scarlet, "I think this will help your business. Best of luck, Mark" Mike hits send, grabs his bag and exits. 
EXT. ED'S HOUSE - DUSK 
Mike steps outside, throws his duffel into the Aston.    Ed exits the house. 
ED Where you going? 
MIKE I'm moving on. See you at the game. 
Mike climbs into the car, pulls out of the driveway. 
INT. MIKE'S HOUSE/KITCHEN - DUSK 
Scarlet sits at the kitchen table working on her laptop. The noise of an incoming email. She clicks over...MARK FREEDMAN. 
Scarlet reads Mike's email then clicks on the link. A web site pops up...`Scarlet's Sanctuaries'. Scarlet smiles. 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - NIGHT 
An empty gym. Mike stands feet beyond the 3 point line, grabs balls from a hopper and rapidly shoots, shoots, shoots. SWISH...SWISH...SWISH. Automatic. 
Coach Harvey enters. 
COACH HARVEY Hey, Freedman, save some for the game. 
Mike sinks one last jumper, turns to the coach. 
MIKE Just warming up, Coach. 
Coach Harvey hands Mike a towel. 
COACH HARVEY Son, I haven't seen anyone with your shooting ability in, well, in a long time. I called a couple college scouts I know. They're coming to the game tonight...to watch you. If you have half the season I think you're capable of, you can play anywhere you want. 
MIKE That's the plan, Coach. 
The rest of the Falcons basketball team jogs out from the locker room followed by a PHOTOGRAPHER. 
COACH HARVEY Round up, Jock Straps! Picture time. 
The Team assembles in the middle of the court. Alex moves away from Mike. A PLAYER kneeling in front holds a sign, `FITCH FALCONS, 2008.' 
PHOTOGRPAHER 
FLASH.   And with the flash WE cut to: 
INT. FITCH SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL/GYM - LATER 
A POPULAR SONG rocks the gymnasium. CHEERLEADERS dance on the sidelines. STUDENTS and PARENTS cheer wildly from the packed stands. 
Julie gabs with a group of TEACHERS.

INT. FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN -- WEDNESDAY MORNING 
Two dozen KINDGERGARTNERS listen to their teacher, MS. BERRY. The word "Work" is on the blackboard. 
MS. BERRY "Work." Today we're going to share what our parents do for work. QUICK CUTS of a series of five-year olds standing beside their desks, addressing the class: 
JEFF My dad is a truck driver. 
MELINDA My mommy is a doctor. 
CAROLYN My dad is a librarian and my mom is a vegetarian. 
THEODORE (with difficulty) My father is a struck-sher-al- engine-ear. 
CRAIG     - My mother is an actress. She works at Denny's. 
KELLY My daddy works at a place where they make stuff, and my mommy is a mommy. 
ELLIOT (looking a little 
CRAZED) My father is a postal worker. The QUICK CUTS end with MAX: 
MAX My mom's a teacher. As Max starts to sit: 
MS. BERRY And your dad? 
MAX 
(HESITANT) My dad? He's . . . a liar. 
MS. BERRY (taken aback) 
A liar? I don't think you mean "a liar." 
MAX Well... he wears a suit and goes to court and talks to the judge and-- 
MS. BERRY 
(RELIEVED) Oh! I see-- you mean he's a lawyer. 
Max shrugs. 
INT. COURTROOM .-- DAY 
FLETCHER REID, early 30's, stands before the JUDGE. His manner is utterly genuine and convincing. 
FLETCHER A dark street. . . a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il. The prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open-and-shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized. He nods at the victim - - a fragile OLD MAN in his 70's. 
FLETCHER (CONT'D) Well, for once I agree with t he prosecutor. This is an open-and shut case -- but the true victim is my client. Fletcher's CLIENT is a 250 pound brute in a suit. 
FLETCHER (CONT'D) Put yourself in his shoes for a moment--walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs. As he describes his client's movements, Fletcher ACTS THEM 
OUT: 
FLETCHER (CONT'D) You're nervous, timid, looking over your shoulder -- when suddenly, you encounter him-- (pointing at the old man) pouncing from the shadows. You quiver in fear. The streetlight flashes on something shiny in his hand-- a knife? 
Suddenly Fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a weapon. The jurors RECOIL. 
FLETCHER (CONT'D) And in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would -- you defend y ou rse lf. Only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake... the man was merely walking away from an ATM machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card. He reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card. 
FLETCHER (CONT'D) 
(CONCERNED) As you stand over his crumpled, though potentially still-dangerous form, your he art goes out to him. You want to help. First, you gather up the many bills he dropped, to stop them from bl owi ng away. Second, in an effort to get the name and number of someone to notify, you take his wallet. Finally, you leap into the man's Lexus to head for assistance, when suddenly a police car speeds up. You breathe a sigh of relief: "Someone to look -after the injured man! Oh joy!" But do the police applaud your initiative? Do they hail your heroism? No-- they arrest you and throw you in the slammer! He walks along the jury box: 
FLETCHER You know, you were much easier when we were married... (re: her luggage) So where are you off too? 
AUDREY Stanford. I'm delivering a paper. 
FLETCHER O h really? Where I live, we use a boy on a bike. 
MAX Hey mom, dad's taking me to see wrestling! 
AUD REY 
(MILDLY 
PROTESTING) Oh, Fletcher! 
FLETCHER 
(PLAYFULLY mimicking her) Oh, Audrey! 
AUDREY Do you have to take him to tho se things? They're so violent. 
Fleccher IMITATES the familiar wise, old INDIAN CHIEF DAN 
GEORGE. 
FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE The boy must learn the way of the war rior . An d wh o be tter to teach him than Rowdy Rod- . Piper and Big John Stud? Audrey can't help but LAUGH. 
FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE He must be schooled in the way of the face-claw, the sleeper- hold, and the purple nuxple. For only then-- 
AUDREY 
(PLAYFULLY) Shut up!! 
FLETCHER/DAN GEORGE (to Max) The squaw will never understand us. A HORN HONKS. It's the good-natured, affable JERRY. Max runs up to him. 
JERRY Max, my man! Jerry gives Max "five", then kisses Audrey on the lips. 
JERRY Fletcher, good to see you? 
FLETCHER What? No kiss for me? 
JERRY (re: luggage) What do you say, Max? Give me a hand? Fletcher grits his teeth as Jerry gives Max a piggyback ride to get the luggage. 
FLETCHER (to Audrey) I didn't know the boyfriend was going. 
AUDREY Jerry. His name is Jerry and yes, he's going. Audrey heads inside. 
INT. HOUSE - DAY                           ·. 
Audrey enters, shuts the blinds. 
FLETCHER T o Stanford? Overnight? Does this mean you two are... (cringes, can't say the words) 
AUDREY I've been seeing him seven months, what do you think? 
FLETGHER I was hoping that after being married to me, you'd have no more strength left. 
AUDREY . Well you have to remember when we were married, I wasn't having sex nearly as often as you were. 
FLETCHER MEDIC!! I've been hit. 
EXT. HOUSE - DAY           '           ·   ' 
Audrey locks up. 
FLETCHER Well, great... I'm so happy for you two. I am just Mister H appy man. Happy, happy, happy. 
AUDREY Relax, Fletcher. It looks like Jerry's taking that job offer in Boston. Fletcher turns sincere. 
FLETCHER Aud, I am so sorry... 
Behind her back, he FLAILS in celebration.    She glances back... He stops, whistles innocently. 
HAIR) What do you think? 
FLETCHER Fabulous! I love it. (indicates the                     · 
BASKET) What's this? 
JANE I don't know who sent it. But it's for Mr. Allan. It's his anniversary. 
FLETCHER Ah... The Partnership Committee meeting still scheduled for Friday? 
JANE (as she goes) Yep... Fletcher quickly removes a gift card from his pocket, scribbles on it, puts it in place of the one already there 
MAX What are you doing? 
FLETCHER Oh, I'm... fixing the card, (shows him the old card) Look, they spelled Mr. Allan's name wrong. Have an apple. 
INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON 
...Where a troubled FRED RAND is talking to MIRANDA, a beautiful, steely partner. 
FRED I can't do it. 
M IRANDA Fred, it's your duty to present the strongest case possible. 
FRED The strongest case possible, consistent with the truth. 
MIRANDA Let the Judge decide what's true. That's what he gets paid for. You get paid to win. 
FRED If you insist on my taking it to trial, I'll represent Mrs. Cole aggressively and ethically. But, Miranda -- I won't lie. Miranda looks out her window, calculating. 
MIRANDA Then we'll just have to find someone who'will. 
INT. HALLWAY OF LAW OFFICES -- AFTERNOON 
Fletcher strides through the hallway with Max, calling out GREETINGS to his colleagues. 
FLETCHER Hey, Pete! Great tie!        ·. Max looks at PETE, -whose fashion-disaster tie startles him. 
FLETCHER Thomas--looks like you're losin' weight. THOMAS glances up from a file. Max notes that he's corpulent. 
THOMAS Gained three pounds. 
FLETCHER (wedging past 
HIM) On you, it works. 
Fletcher arrives at his office. WE MEET his secretary, the fiftyish, .worldly-wise and world-weary GRETA. 
GRETA ' M ax ! What's new? 
.MAX Well. . . it's my birthday tomo rrow. We're having a party and everything. Flet cher's EYES WIDEN. He has clearly forgotten. 
GRE TA I'm sure your dad'11 give you something wonderful. Fletcher tries to wave her off, awkwardly stopping when Max turns to him.     . 
MAX Yeah? 
FLETCHER Oh, yeah. You're going to love it. Uh, why don't you play in my office for a minute? Fax something, sue someone, have a good time. We'll be leaving in a second. 
Max heads into the office. Fletcher closes the door behind him turning it into a silly, two-handed wave. 
FLETCHER (CONT'D) Damn!   I completely forgot. 
GRETA Oh, there's a surprise. Greta produces a wrapped GIFT. 
FLETCHER You're a saint. I should get you something. 
GRETA You did. She holds up another, smaller package. 
FLETCHER Ah. Well, I always do the classy thing. Any calls? 
She hands him a stack of mail. 
DOES) Thank you. (without looking 
UP) We are having some fun, eh Maxer? PUSH IN on Max; he isn't. 
·INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Jerry paces. Audrey is on the phone, waiting.   She notices Jerry pacing. 
AUDREY Are you alright? 
JERRY Uh, yeah, just, uh... how long are you gonna be on the phone? 
AUDREY I just wanted to say good- night to Max, but he must still be out with Fletcher, (hangs up) 
JERRY 
(SUDDENLY) Will you marry me? She's SHOCKED. 
I 
AUDREY Uh...would I . . . ? What did you say? 
JERRY 
(NERVOUS) I proposed, I . . . Look, I know this Boston thing is a great opportunity, good job, mo ney .. . everything. But I started to think about being three thousand miles away from you and Max. And I didn't like it. I-- Look, I know it's a lot to ask, to move and everything, but I . . . . I love 
you. I love your son.   Will you marry me? She stares at him, excited, but nervous. 
EXT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING 
Early morning outside Fletcher's building. 
INT. FLETCHER'S STUDY - MORNING 
Fletcher types on his computer.   He's been up all night. He leans back, rubs his eyes. When he opens them he sees Max standing there in pajamas. Fletcher SMILES. 
FLETCHER Max Factor... Happy birthday. How old are you today? T h ir t y ? Forty? 
MAX Five. 
FLETCHER Well, you've held up well. I only wish there was some way to commemorate such an occasion, some small symbol to mark this day, like.... Fletcher produces -- 
FLETCHER . . . A present! . 
Max eyes it with wonder. 
MAX What is it? 
FLETCHER (no idea) It's... it's. (it hits him) a surprise. Max knows his father doesn't have a clue but he rips the box open, revealing, a BASEBALL, GLOVE, DODGER'S CAP, and 
FULL MAJOR LEAGUE STYLE UNIFORM. 
MAX Baseball stuff! 
_J 
FLETCHER Baseball stuff. 
MAX (hugging his dad) Will you play catch with me? 
FLETCHER            '· 
Absorootentootenlutely. Max beams. 
FLETCHER Tonight. After your party, you have my word on it. Max nods sadly as Fletcher turns back to his work. 
EXT. JERRY'S CAR - MORNING 
Jerry and Audrey are driving. Audrey's holding a couple of airline tickets. 
AUDR EY (re: tickets) Jerry, these are for tomorrow. 
FLETCHER After all that, your husband wants to deny you a fair share of the marital assets based on one single act of 
INDISCRETION-- 
VIRGINIA Seven. 
FLETCHER Hm? 
VIRGINIA Seven single acts of indiscretion. 
FLETCHER --Seven acts of indiscretion, only one of which he has any evidence of, and all of which he himself is responsible, for. 
VIRGINIA He is? 
FLETCHER Mrs. Cole, I stayed up all night last night studying your c ase. Not just your case... b ut you. And, by now, I feel I know you. You are the victim here. The wife of a cold, distant businessman. Starved for affection, driven into the arms of another man-- 
VIRGINIA Seven. 
FLETCHER (not missing a 
BEAT) --Seven .other men. You're not trying to deny him what is r ig htf ull y his. All you're insisting on is what is r ig htf ull y yours. And maybe an idgy-smidgy bit more. I think you're bending over backwards. 
VIRGINIA Well, I did agree to give him j oint custody of the kids... (to Miranda) He's always been a good father. 
FLETCHER And you've always been a good wife. 
VIRGINIA (getting worked 
UP) Yeah. . . 
FLETCHER There's such a thing as being t oo nice. That's why you need aggr essive representation. To show the court that there is more than one side to this st ory. All I'm asking is the opportunity to see that justice is done on your behalf. (takes her hand) Will you give me that opportunity? 
He stares into her eyes. A moment, then... 
VIRGINIA Yes! I ' m tired of getting kicked around. 
FLETCHER Good for you! 
VIRGINIA Thank you, Mr. Reid. I ' m so grateful I have an attorney I can trust. S he gives him a HUG and momentarily grabs his ass. With a farewell nod to Miranda, she leaves. Miranda turns, smiles at Fletcher, then shuts the door. She moves in on him. 
MIRANDA You're good. You're really good. 
FLETCHER Oh, pshaw. (pronounces it with the "p") She picks a piece of lint off.his jacket. 
MIRANDA N o, I mean it. The Cole case is worth a truckload of money to this firm, not to mention the press it's going to g en er at e . You win this case and I guarantee you'll make partner. 
(STRAIGHTENING his tie) Actually, how would you like to make a partner right now? 
FLETCHER Excuse me? She grabs his lapels and pulls him in for a deep KISS. 
INT, AUDREY AND MAX'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A PARTY in progress, KINDERGARTNERS being entertained by a MAN in a clown suit and clown make-up. 
CLOWN 
(SINGING) Captain Fuzzy is my name, Making children happy is my game, With a shake and a juggle, And a big belt buckle, You'll all be glad I came. ' He flops down on his back causing something in his pants to HONK. Audrey and Jerry watch. 
AUDREY (indicating the 
CLOWN) What do you think? 
JERRY Well, if you don't hire your brother, who will? 
She heads into... 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
JERRY They called me again from B oston. They really want me there tomorrow. 
AUDREY . . . I can't go to Boston. 
MAX (V.O.) I wish, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. He takes a breath --and blows out all the candles. A strange WIND blows the drapes and the wisp of smoke up, up, up... to the clock on the wall. It's 9:15. 
CUT TO: A clock on a wall.   It's 9:15'. We are-- 
INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
PAN around Miranda's office, where the displaced sofa is adorned with Fletcher's shoes... To the credenza, where Fletcher's pants hang... To the lamp, where Fletcher's shorts swing... To the desk, where a ravished Miranda lies next to Fletcher. Superbly confident of the answer, she asks-- 
MIRANDA S o . . . was it good for you? Without thinking, Fletcher responds in the most astonishing way possible-- he TELLS THE TRUTH. 
FLETCHER I've had better. Miranda turns to him in disbelief -- but it's nothing compared to the LOOK OF SHOCK on Fletcher's face. 
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
The door opens -- and the naked Fletcher is forcefully kicked out. He goes TUMBLING over a desk as a RAIN OF CLOTHES follow. The door SLAMS SHUT again, leaving him without his pants. A CLEANING LADY stares at him in shock, then takes her broom, aims for his crotch, SWINGS.and. . . 
INT. BEDROOM - FRIDAY MORNING 
An alarm CLOCK RINGS. Fletcher BOLTS UP in bed. With regret and wonder he remembers: 
FLETCHER "I've had better?" 
INT. FLETCHER'S BATHROOM - MORNING 
Fletcher brushes his teeth, looks up at his reflection in the mirror, mouth foaming. 
FLETCHER "I've had better?!" 
INT. HALLWAY OF FLETCHER'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING 
Dressed for work, Fletcher waits for the elevator. 
FLETCHER (laughing it off) "I've had better?" I t arrives. He steps in. 
INT. APARTMENT ELEVATOR - MORNING 
The elevator is empty, except for Fletcher... and a beautiful young WOMAN. 
FLETCHER New in the building? 
MODEL I just moved in Monday. 
FLETCHER Ah. Well, you must allow me to give you the grand tour. 
MODEL 
(SHE'S 
INTERESTED) O h? Do you do that for all the new tenants? 
FLETCHER No. Just the ones I want to bang like a drum. Fletcher's face REGISTERS extreme SHOCK and... 
INT. LOBBY OF APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING 
We HEAR a SMACK off camera and a PING as the elevator door opens. The model storms off and A STUNNED Fletcher steps out, rubbing his freshly slapped face. 
EXT. COURTROOM -, MORNING 
A SHAKY Fletcher strides toward the courthouse... when he is accosted by a BEGGAR. 
BEGGAR Any change, Mister? 
.FLETCHER Absolutely. But he continues walking. 
BEGGAR Could you spare some? 
FLETCHER Unquestionably. Fletcher walks faster, PUZZLED that he has answered truthfully. The beggar is even more puzzled. 
BEGGAR Will you? 
FLETCHER No. 
JUDGE STEVENS Fine. 
VIRGINIA (aside, to 
FLETCHER) What are you doing? 
FLETCHER 
(WORRIED) 
I don't know. (to judge, with 
SOME 
DESPERATION) Your Honor, I ' d like a continuance! 
JUDGE STEVENS " This case has already been delayed several times, Mr. Reid. 
FLETCHER I realize that, Your Honor, but I ' d really, really, really like a continuance. 
JUDGE STEVENS I'll have to hear good cause, counselor. What's the problem? 
FLETCHER'S P.O.V. 
The ROOM begins to SPIN slowly -- then faster -- then faster -- until we wind up squarely on -- 
FLETCHER'S FACE 
FLETCHER I can't lie! 
JUDGE STEVENS 
(IMPATIENT) Commendable, Mr. Reid, but I'm still waiting for the good caus e. Now, do you have it or . not? 
'            FLETCHER 
(TRUTHFUL) Not. 
JUDGE STEVENS Motion for a continuance denied. Is there any chance of a settlement in this case? 
DANA I don't think so, Your Honor. Mr. Reid made it abundantly clear that the last thing in the world he wanted was to -- 
FLETCHER 
(DESPERATE) 
SETTLE! SETTLE! SETTLE! Dana and Mr. Cole look at Fletcher with surprise. 
JUDGE STEVENS There appears to have been a change in strategy. Let's go to my chambers and negotiate. He BANGS the gavel. 
INT. JUDGE STEVENS'S CHAMBERS - MORNING 
Dana and an apprehensive Fletcher sit before the judge 
DANA Your Honor, under the terms of the prenuptual agreement, if Mrs. Cole commits adultery, she is entitled to nothing. We have in our possession an audiotape made by a licensed private investigator of an explicit act of sexual congress with a man who is not her husband. 
JUDGE STEVENS Sounds pretty damning, Mr. Reid. 
FLETCHER It certainly does. 
DANA However, my client has no desire to see his ex-wife destitute. Against my advice, he's willing to offer her a cash settlement of.two point four million dollars. 
JUDGE STEVENS Two four seems like a pretty fair offer, Mr. Reid. 
FLETCHER Fantastically fair. Phenominally fair. In fact, I'd say beyond fair, bordering on stupid. Dana fumes. The judge finds Fletcher's boldness refreshing. 
JUDGE STEVENS What are you suggesting, Mr. Rei d? That Ms. Appleton's willingness to proffer such an offer betrays a lack of faith in her position? 
FLETCHER (utterly sincere) No, not at all. She's got my client dead to rights. When 
attorneys go to sleep at night, they dream of having a case as strong as hers. 
· GRETA Hi, boss. What's happening 
WITH-- 
FLETCHER 
DON'T ASK! FOR GOD'S SAKE, 
PLEASE DON'T ASK! -- And races into his office. 
I NT . FLETCHER'S OFFICE - MORNING 
He leans against the door, trying to catch his breath. 
FLETCHER, 
(PACING) Do n't panic. You can beat this -- it's all a matter of willpower. He dives for his desk and rifles through it. 
FL ET CH ER A test. . . Something small... Aha! He holds up a BLUE PEN. 
FLETCHER (CONT'D) Red.   Red. All right. Focus, (with great 
DELIBERATION) The color of this pen is · r--. R--. R--! The color of this pen is--blue! AAAAHH! (burying his 
HEAD) Ahhhh! One' tiny lie and I can't say it!! 
(suddenly sitting 
UP) ' I'll write.it! He takes a sheet of PAPER, his pen and writes "This pen i s . . . " He tries to write an "R" but can't. He STRAINS. S TR AIN S HARDER. He's out of his chair, on the desk. His feet KICK OVER OBJECTS on the shelves'behind him. He finally forces pen to paper. He looks down where he wrote 
INADVERTENTLY: "This pen is blue." 
F LE TC HE R 
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO! ! ! ! Greta enters to find-- FLETCHER running around the office, shaking the blue pen in the air. 
GRETA Boss, what's wrong? 
FLETCHER . The pen is blue!! The pen is     . b l u e ! ! The GODDAMN PEN IS 
BLUE !!! Almost weeping, he collapses into a chair. A moment -- then Greta tentatively offers him a red pen. 
GRETA Red? 
FLETCHER 
(BITTER) Oh, that's easy for you to say?! 
GRETA Are you all right? 
FLETCHER (getting up) I have to go home. 
GRETA Home? Was the case settled? 
FLETCHER No. I have to be in court at one-thirty. 
GRETA Well, then how can you.go home? 
FLETCHER I don't know, I don't know!!! 
GRETA Okay. (walking on 
EGGSHELLS) Before I forget -- Rubin and Dun n called. They want to know where the Darvis settlement offer stands. 
FLETCHER I only proposed a settlement t o dick with them. I never had any intention of going th ro ug h with it.  . Not certain why her boss would .shoot himself in the foot, Greta nonetheless jots down his remarks. 
GRETA '·...dick with them." Okay. Your accountant, Philip, called to remind you about getting together. . 
FLETCHER I'd rather shave my ass and sit in vinegar.. 
GRETA (jotting down a 
seemed more important than attending my son's birthday! 
A U D R EY M y God!! She SLAMS DOWN the phone. 
INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE 
Fletcher BANGS THE PHONE against his head in frustration! '.

E X T . FULGHAM KINDERGARTEN - MORNING 
The Volvo parks. Audrey gets out. She leans over to say good-bye to her son.             ,                 . 
MAX Is dad picking me up? 
AUDREY No, I'm sorry, Max. He can't make it. I will. I'll work it out. Max is disappointed. 
MAX I guess my wish didn't come · true. 
AUDREY What wish? 
MAX I wished that, for just one day, Dad couldn't tell a lie. Max heads toward his teacher. Audrey is deeply moved. 
INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE 
He's dialing the phone. 
FLETCHER Answer, answer, answer... 
INTERCUT WITH AUDREY'S CAR 
AUDREY Hello. 
FLETCHER Audrey, let me explain. Something has happened to me-- 
AUDREY Fletcher, something else is about to happen to you. 
FLETCHER. What do you mean? 
AUDREY Max and I are moving to Boston. 
FLETCHER What?! 
AUDREY Jerry asked me to marry him. He wants Max and I to fly with him this weekend to pick out a house. And I'm going to go. God knows I don't have any reason to stay here. 
FLETCHER (panicking)    . Wait, you can't move! If you take Max away... I'll practically never see him. 
AUDREY Well then you'll have pretty much the same relationship you have with him now. 
FLETCHER Audrey, please.... Is this because of what I just said on the phone? 
AUDREY That was the straw and this is the camel's back saying goodbye. 
FLETCHER Where are you? 
AUDREY Heading home. 
FLETCHER When you gee there, stay there. I'll be right over. We have to talk. 
AUDREY 
FLETCHER-- 
FLETCHER I'll be right- there! 
He hangs up and heads for the door.      It opens and Miranda enters. 
FLETCHER It means if you're daddy left your mommy, he'd call me. 
CRAIG So what do you do? 
FLETCHER (growing more and more impatient) I help people fight over their money and their children. 
THEODORE Can't they fight without you? 
FLETCHER ' " They could but then J wouldn't make a living. 
JILL Why would my daddy leave my mommy? 
FLETCHER To marry a younger woman. To escape a loveless marriage and have cheap meaningless sex. To cling to an illusion of youth as his body gives way to sore backs, flat feet, spare tires, gum disease, hair loss, liver spots, kidney stones, clogged arteries, diabetes, goiter and eventual death. The kids EYES GO WIDE. A moment, then: 
MS. BERRY 
(BRIGHTLY) Well, I think it's time for fingerpainting. 
EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY 
They're in the playground just outside the classroom. 
FLETCHER Monster-Max. 
MAX Dadzilla. You came to play catch? 
FLETCHER No. I ' d like to, but I can't right now. Max is disappointed again. 
FLETCHER (CONT'D) I ' m sorry I missed your party la st night. How was your Uncle Glen? 
MAX Stupid. His big nose and stupid orange hair... 
FLETCHER That's why he should have worn make-up. Fletcher elbows Max, playfully, trying to induce a laugh. Max doesn't laugh. 
'       MAX . I want to play kickball with my friends.- 
FLETCHER Yeah, okay, urn... Your mother told me about... the wish you made last night. It came true. Max is amazed. 
MAX Really? You mean you have to tell the truth? 
FLETCHER Yes. 
MAX No matter what? 
FLETCHER No matter what. 
Max grins -- then suddenly asks, in rapid succession. 
MAX Is wrestling real? 
FLETCHER In the Olympics, yes.      On    . Channel 23, no. 
MAX Will sitting close to the TV set make me go blind? 
FLETCHER Not in a million years. 
MAX If I keep making this face-- (makes a horrible 
FACE) will it get stuck that way? 
FLETCHER Uh-uh. 
MAX .If I go in the water right after lunch, will I drown? 
FLETCHER Only if you can't 'swim. 
MAX Why do I have to eat squash? 
FLETCHER Because your mom buys it. 
MAX How come you're always too busy to play with me? The sudden shift in tone startles Fletcher. He feels awful. 
A worried and preoccupied Fletcher is heading toward his office building when a MACHO ATTORNEY passes by. 
MACHO ATTORNEY Yo, Fletcher! How's it hanging? 
FLETCHER Short and shrivelled. Fletcher hurries up the steps when he spots Philip. He shields his face with his briefcase. Philip recognizes him anyway. 
PHILIP Fletcher! I'm still waiting for your call. I guess you must've lost my card -- 
FLETCHER No -- 
PHILIP Or my phone was busy -- 
FLETCHER No -- 
PHILIP Or you just forgot -- 
FLETCHER No -- 
PHILIP (cannot be 
DISCOURAGED) Or something. So anyway,' why don't you swing by my place around seven-thirty! Philip starts off, when Fletcher calls after him resolutely. 
FLETCHER Philip... I don't want to come over to your house! A long moment, then -- 
PHILIP Fi n e ! We'll go out! There's this new karaoke bar I've been dying to try. I'll pick you up at your office! Seven- thirty! ! And he runs off.   Frustrated, Fletcher hurries on. 
INT. OFFICE'S - DAY 
Fletcher drags himself past Greta's desk. Miranda gives him the stink-eye. Fletcher doesn't see her. 
GRETA Do you want your messages? 
FLETCHER No. He goes into his office. Greta is concerned.   She follows him in, leaving his door open. 
INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
Fletcher collapses onto his couch. Greta enters. 
GRETA Are you okay? 
FLETCHER My son hates me. 
GRETA No! He loves you. I've seen y ou together. You're his hero. 
FLETCHER O h yeah? Last night at his birthday party, he made a ·wish. That I wouldn't be able to tell a lie for one whole day. 
GRETA Kids... 
FLETCHER It came true. 
GRETA What? 
FLETCHER It's true. Didn't it seem odd to you that I kept telling the truth all morning? 
GRETA Well, yeah, but... 
(INCREDULOUS) You're telling me that you can't lie. 
FLETCHER That's right!     I am incapable of lying. 
INT. OUTER OFFICE 
Miranda is 'eavesdropping.    A wicked gleam in her eye, 
INT. FLETCHER'S OFFICE 
GRETA Just today? 
FLETCHER Apparently until 9:15 tonight. It's a twenty-four hour curse. 
GRETA Yes, those are going around. 
FLETCHER Extremely. 
MIRANDA Good. Would you follow me, please? Highly nervous, Fletcher follows Miranda down the hall. 
MIRANDA (CONT'D) Fletcher, did you know that the partnership committee is being headed up by Mr. Allan himself? (off his wary 
NOD) Say, you used to work directly for Mr. Allan, didn't you? (off his waried 
NOD) Tell me, what do you think of him? 
FLETCHER 
(HELPLESS) He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. 
MIRANDA 
(GRINNING) How delightful! She swings open a door, ushering Fletcher into -- 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
The room is filled with ATTORNEYS, including MR. ALLAN, the founder himself. Fletcher freezes. 
MIRANDA Pardon me for interrupting your, meeting. Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reid. 
MR. ALLAN ·It's good to see you again, Fletcher. '. An involuntary WHIMPER from Fletcher. 
MIRANDA Oh, that's right. You used to work together. .Tell me, what do you think of Mr. Allah? Fl etc he r gulps. This is it. His career is history. He's trying to hold it back, but-- 
MIRANDA I said... What do you think of Mr. Allan? 
FLETCHER     . He's a pedantic, pontificating, pretentious bastard, a belligerent old fart, a worthless, steaming pile of cow dung. DE AN SILENCE. Then --Mr. Allan bursts into raucous LAUGHTER. He is joined by everyone except Miranda, who looks on, STUNNED. Everyone pounds the table in hysterics. 
MR. ALLAN Marvelous! Marvelous! That's what I love most about this firm-- the collegial atmosphere, the hearty good- fellowship! Miranda is incensed. 
MR. ALLAN (CONT'D) And thanks for those flowers for my anniversary. My wife loved them. 
FLETCHER Well, I'm due in court... bye- bye. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Fletcher exits the conference, closes the door, breathes a sigh of relief, then FAINTS.   . 
INT. COURTROOM 
CLOSE UP of Fletcher, seated alone at a table. His hands are on his-face. He looks totally dazed. At the other table, sit Dana Appleton and Mr. Cole. 
BAILIFF All rise. They do. Judge Stevens enters. He sits. Everyone sits. 
JUDGE STEVENS Counselors, are we ready to begin? 
FLETCHER (eagerly and a little too 
LOUDLY) N o sir! We are not ready to b eg in. My client has not arrived. The doors OPEN and Virginia Cole enters with her CHILDREN and a NANNY. 
FLETCHER      ·   . --   until now. 
He collapses into his chair. 
(to Falk, with 
DETERMINATION) Did you and Mrs. Cole ever make lo-- forni-- roll in the h-- make the beast with two ba -- Did you two ever fu-- fu-- Fu! He begins to hyperventilate.     Virginia turns to Falk. 
VIRGINIA Wate r! Get him water! Falk hurries into the building as Fletcher hacks on. 
FLETCHER Fu-- fu-- 
VIRGINIA S it down! Get some air! (slaps him on the 
BACK) Try to relax! Breathe deeply! Falk hurries out with a cup, hands it to Fletcher, who downs it in one gulp -- then spews it out again, SCREAMING in PAIN. - 
VIRGINIA (CONT'D) W hat?!   What?! 
VIRGINIA (O.S.) Yes! YES! YES! The groans reach their incredible climax. There's a still moment. . . As the shy COURT REPORTER, the macho BAILIFFS and the no- nonsense judge all mop their brows, Dana shuts off the tape. She turns to Fletcher with a satisfied smile. 
DANA Your witness. 
FLETCHER No questions. 
JUDGE STEVENS No questions? . 
VIRGINIA No questions? 
FLETCHER (afraid to ask 
ANY) No questions. 
DANA 
(TRIUMPHANT) Petitioner rests. 
JUDGE STEVENS All right, Mr. Reid. You may proceed. 
FLETCHER (to himself) How?! Gathering his courage, he stands, downs the last of his water, and moves to the lecturn. He's about to speak... when a WONDERFUL FEELING sweeps through him. After a momement, he grins. 
FLETCHER (CONT'D) Would the Court be willing to grant me a short bathroom break? 
JUDGE STEVENS It can't wait? 
FLETCHER Not unless you want to mop up. 
JUDGE STEVENS 
(FRUSTRATED) All right, but get back in here immediately so .we can finish this. Fletcher beams. Then necessity compels him to race out. 
INT. REST ROOM - DAY 
Fletcher stands before the urinal, taking the longest leak i n legal history. Relief. Then, he looks at his watch. It's only 4:15. ' 
FLETCHER What did I think? That I could piss for forty-five minutes?! He HITS HIS FOREHEAD in frustration... and gets an idea. He HITS HIMSELF AGAIN and AGAIN, SMASHES HIS HEAD INTO THE WALL, POKES HIMSELF IN THE EYES, YANKS ON HIS EARS, finally KNOCKS HIMSELF IN THE STALL, where he continues his attack. A MAN enters, hears a commotion from behind the stall door. 
MAN What's going on in-there? 
FLETCHER (O . S . ) I ' m abusing myself! Do you mind?! The man looks disgusted. He carefully leaves the room. 
INT. COURTROOM - DAY 
The judge is PISSED. Suddenly the bailiff helps in the severly beaten Fletcher. The entire courtroom is SHOCKED. 
BAILIFF I found him like this in the bathroom. Somebody beat the hell out of him. 
JUDGE STEVENS Who did this? 
FLETCHER 
(TRUTHFULLY) A madman, Your Honor.. A desperate fool at the end of his pitiful.rope. 
JUDGE STEVENS -What did he look like? 
FLETCHER 
(DESCRIBING 
HIMSELF) About five eleven, hundred eighty-five pounds, crazed look in his eye. 
JUDGE STEVENS Bailiff, have the deputies search the building. A HUBBUB rises. He bangs the gavel. 
JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D) Under the circumstances, I have no choice but to recess this case until tomorrow morning at nine. Fletcher smiles serenly -- until -- 
JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D) -- Unless, of course, you think you can still proceed? Fletcher covers his mouth in a desperate attempt to avoid answering, but he can't repress the truth. 
JUDGE STEVENS (CONT'D) Can you? 
FLETCHER Yes, I can. 
LIFTED! TEETH -- (pulling out 
CAPS) 
CAP PED! FIV E-NIN ETY A 
CHICKLET!! 
COMMOTION in the court.   The judge BANGS HIS GAVEL!!! 
JUDGE STEVENS Bailiff! Remove Mr. Reid from the courtroom! 
FLETCHER Yo u wanna know the truth? Oh yeah, let's let it rain... The truth is is that I've traded my life...a beautiful wife, an incredible son for THIS PISS 
POT OF BIG DOUBLE O'S! The bailiff grabs Fletcher, forces him out... 
FLETCHER 
GO AHEAD, YOUR HONOR, BANG 
YOUR GAVEL .-- KEEP TELLING 
YOURSELF YOU'RE A BIG SHOT! DO 
I SENSE A CASE OF GAVEL ENVY!! 
WHAT'S THAT UNDER YOUR ROBE -- 
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE?!! (the judge is turning beet 
RED) 
. I TOUCHED A NERVE DIDN'T I? 
WE'RE ALL A BUNCH OF BULLSHIT 
ARTISTS!! IS THAT THE TRUTH 
IN YOUR PANTS OR ARE YOU JUST 
HAPPY TO SEE ME?? Fletcher is pushed passed Mr. Allan. 
MR. ALLAN You just killed your career. I hope you're happy. 
FLETCHER 
I'M BEYOND HAPPY MY BUTT FACED 
FRIEND--- I'M EUPHORIC! 
EXT. AUDREY'S PORCH -'DAY 
A sad Max is seated on the steps. TWO other BOYS are there with baseball equipment. 
PAUL We're going home. 
EMMANUEL Yeah, thanks for the great game, Max. Emanuel knocks Max's hat off. Audrey's been watching from the door. She goes and sits by her son. 
AUDREY Max, honey. Your dad had a very big case today. It probably just-- 
MAX I don't want to talk about it. 
AUDREY Okay. 
MAX 
(SUDDENLY) I hate dad! I hate him! 
AUDREY Honey, don^t say that. Max is really upset. It's "that look" and then some. The look Audrey never wanted to see again. She makes a decision. 
AUDREY Max, there's something I-want to talk to you about. . . 
OUT) Yes, well, I heard you went all noble in front of Mr. Allan so-- 
FLETCHER Y ou know what?! I love you. I loveyouloveyouloveyou. I wa nt to hug you. Come here.., 
GRETA Mr. Reid, what has gotten intc to you?! 
FLETCHER Just the truth, Greta. Fifteen years of being stuck in a lie is nowhere near as powerful as one day of being stuck in the truth. 
(checks his 
WATCH) Oh, my God!! I have to go! Thanks again, Greta! (as he runs off he calls back to 
HER) By the way, the truth is that I need you and I couldn't file a paperclip without you! Greta smiles, then catches herself, and quickly regains her "composure". 
CUT TO:

FLE TCHER Shit!! 
INT. LAX UNITED TERMINAL - DAY 
A udrey and Max meet Jerry by the ticket counter. Max is wearing the Dodger cap his dad gave him. Jerry surprises him with a Boston Red Sox hat. 
JERRY A little going away present. I was gonna get you a bowl of clam chowder but they only had Manhattan. 
A UDREY Say thank you, Max.

INT. BMW - DAY 
Fletcher's on the phone.   He sails passed a parked POLICE 
CAR. 
FLETCHER (into phone) Shelton, Jerry Shelton. What time's that flight leave? 7:50. Thank you. (checks his 
WATCH) Oh, shit! Shit!! Shit! Fletcher spots the FLASHING LIGHTS. 
FLETCHER Shiiiiit!!! He pulls over -- so quick he jumps the curb. 
POLICE OFFICER Would you step out of the car, please? Fletcher obeys. 
FLETCHER Listen; I know I'm driving a little crazy but i have an emergency to attend to... The cop's just getting off his walkie talkie. 
POLICE OFFICER I'm impounding this vehicle. 
FLETCHER W h y ? What for? For changing lanes? 
POLICE OFFICER I just ran your tags through the computer. You've got. seventeen unpaid parking tickets. 
FLETCHER No ! I paid them! This morning! That's the truth!      I swear!! 
POLICE OFFICER Not according to the computer. 
FLETCHER The computer is wrong! It ' hasn't been updated. The computer's a liar! 
POLICE OFFICER You can straighten it out at the impound yard. 
FLETCHER (checks his watch, firmly) 
NO! 
POLICE OFFICER No?

PHILIP!! 
Fletcher KISSES HIM ON THE LIPS. 
INT. PHILIP'S CAR - DAY 
Philip's driving Fletcher. 
FLETCHER You're saving my life, Philip. 
PHILIP You know, it's funny, but for some reason I was beginning to think you didn't like me. Isn't that silly? 
FLETCHER . No. It's not silly.       I don't like you. 
PHILIP What? 
FLETCHER I don't like you. I'm sorry. I find you boring. I hate ch ara des . And you wouldn't know a good time if it sat on your face. (feels bad) I'm sorry. It was easier than telling you how I really felt. Are you upset? A moment, then: 
PHILIP No. To be honest, I don't like you either. You treat people like obstacles and you cheat at charades. . 
FLETCHER Then why are you always trying to socialize with me? 
PHILIP You're a client. I figured if I didn't try to be your friend, you'd get a new accountant. 
FLETCHER Philip, I don't like you as a person, but I'm crazy about you as my accountant. I ' d never hire a new accountant. Never! 
PHILIP So we don't have to like each other anymore? 
FLETCHER    - Not at all. 
.              PHILIP All right. Sooner I get you ·to the airport, sooner I can dump your sorry ass off. 
EXT. AIRPORT -- DAY 
Philip's car skids to a stop.    Fletcher jumps out. 
INT. LAX TERMINAL - DAY . 
Fletcher races in. 
FLETCHER Bedelayed. Bedelayed. Fog, rain, something, anything... He sees the DEPARTURE BOARD " F li g ht 69. Departs 7:50. On Time. Gate 17." Fletcher looks at the clock -- It's 7:46!!   Holy Shit!! 
INT. LAX ESCALATOR 
Fletcher pushes his way HE a crowded escalator. Past people standing on the left despite the SIGN that says 
STAND ON RIGHT. 
FLETCHER Excuse me. . . excuse me. . . Come on folks, let's let the frantic man pass... Sorry... Thank... you... Standing on the right, passing on the left. They can't make this- deal any easier than it is... Come on... coming through... At the top,- a WOMAN in a NURSES UNIFORM asks for money... 
WOMAN Help the poor?... 
FLETCHER (speeding past) I don't trust you. I don't know what the hell that uniform is. Sorry. (a Hare Krishna tries to stop 
HIM) 
NOT NOW, TOGA BOY! 
INT. LAX - SECURITY AREA 
Fortunately, there's no line at the metal detector. Fletcher races right by but SETS OFF THE ALARM. 
INSPECTOR Please step through again. 
FLETCHER Ahhh!! !    Damn..; Fletcher frantically tosses his keys, cufflinks, his Rolex into a tray. He tries again.     It BUZZES again! 
AUDREY Fletcher?! 
AT THAT INSTANT -- THE PLANE MAKES A SHARP TURN! BUT THE STAIRS DON'T! They keeps going straight, heading · right for the END OF THE RUNWAY and a parked LOADED LUGGAGE 
CART. . - And BAM!   FLETCHER, THE STAIRS, THE LUGGAGE ALL GO FLYING! 
Audrey strains to watch as FLETCHER lands hard ONTO A 
MOUNTAIN OF BAGGAGE! 
CLOSE ON FLETCHER 
With all the strength he has he lifts his head, sees he's in one piece, and then COLLAPSES IN DEFEAT. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT 
Fletcher's BANGED UP pretty good. His head is BANDAGED. He.puts a COLD COMPRESS to his BRUISED FOREHEAD and WINCES. 
FLETCHER (mumbles to 
HIMSELF) Oh boy, the truth hurts.   Yes indeed. 
DEPUTY Mr. Reid. Someone made bail for you. 
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Fletcher comes out LIMPING, totally dishevelled, missing a shoe, and still holding the compress. 
FLETCHER 
(WEAKLY) Greta? Is that you? He looks up and is surprised to see AUDREY and JERRY waiting for him just outside the door. Max is sitting at the bottom of the stairs, still ANGRY. He sees his dad, then quickly turns away. 
FLETCHER (to Audrey and Jerry, trying to seem chipper) Sorry I made you miss your flight, not really. (no response) You're obviously a little . upset, not that I blame you... although I'll bet you'll still get the bonus miles. . . 
AUDREY Fletcher, are you crazy? What were you doing? 
FLETC HER That's two questions. A; Yes, but I think the legal term is temporarily insane. And B; I was trying to finally have that talk with you about Boston. Audrey's patience are growing thin... 
FLETCHER Okay, okay... The whole truth and nothing but the truth, (with difficulty, 
SINCERELY) I tried to stop the plane because it was taking off with my life... you and Max. This comes as a surprise to Audrey. Not just what Fletcher said, but the way he said it. 
FLETCHER I know you've met somebody... somebody pretty great... and the truth is I wish you didn't but you did and... All I ' m asking i s . . . Please don't move to Boston. Please don't take Max away. She's definitely moved by Fletcher, but not convinced. 
AUDREY You can come visit anytime. It's only a four hour flight. 
FLETCHER I don't want to visit him. That's what I've been doing-- visiting him, dropping by, stopping in. I want to be in his life. I don't want to be some jerk that sees him at Easter. I want to be his father. Fletcher turns to Jerry. 
FLETCHER I know I have no right to ask, but can I talk you out of taki ng that job? I can get you a better job here in L.A. I've got all kinds of connect ions... what do you do again? 
JERRY I design security systems. 
FLETCHER How symbolic. Okay great. You know Pac-Tec? 
JERRY The biggest. 
FLETCHER One of their systems shorted out and burned down a supermarket. I got them off. Another proud day for justice. If I ask them they'll beat your Boston offer in two s ec on ds .    .. 
AUDREY Don't put Jerry in the middle. 
JERRY It's okay. (to Fletcher) Boston means this (snaps his 
FINGERS) to me. All I want is for this lady and Max to be happy. Preferably, with me. Whatever they want, I'll go along with. They both look to Audrey. 
AUDREY All I want is for Max to be happy. Audrey looks over to Max seated at the bottom of the stairs. He's still upset. 
AUDREY You better know your jury. You're hot exactly Max's hero today. 
FLETCHER Just let me present my case. Fletcher walks over,, tries to be playful, starts WALKING,

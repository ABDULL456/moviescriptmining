KATE Doctor. Will my girl be all right? 
0 DOCTOR Oh, by morning she'll be knocking down Captain Kellerfs fences again. 
KATE Is there nothing we should do? 
KELLER 
KATE Look. 
(CONTINUED) 
c o.w- u UED She makes a pass with her hand in the crib, at the baby's eyes. 
I KATE (Cont'd) She can't see. Look at her eyes. She takes the lamp from him, moves it before the child's face. She can't seel 
YELLER 
HELENL His face has something like fury in it, crying the child's name; KATE almost fainting presses her knuckles to her mouth, to stop her own cry. 
FADE OUT 
5. DAY. INT. KELLEL HOUSE - TITLE SHOT. 
7. NIGHT. INT. LIVING ROOM KELLER HOUSE - TITLE SHOT. 
There is a Christmas tree with decorations and in a WIDE SHOT we see HELEN, 7 years old, reaching up into tree. At a window we see the faces of Percy 8 years, and Martha, 7 years, looking in. HELENrS hand gets a Christmas ball and rips it down, shattering at her feet. CRAB IN AND AROUND coming to the side of the tree, seeing HELENtS hands, another ball, she pulls it down. We see her face, blurred out, through the pine branches and needles, and beyond her the other children watching. 
$. DAY. EXT. AFIELD - TITLE SHOT. 
A WIDE HIGH SHOT. We see the lonely expanse of field with 0 a low grass sprouting up, in the BG is the Keller house perhaps. Going slowly across the field is the figure of the child HELEN, Patty Duke. From in under CAMERA comes KATE, following her. 
10. CONTINUED smiles. She is flanked by the other two, in a litter of 0 paper-doll cutouts, and while they speak, HELEN'S hands thrust at their faces in turn, feeling baffledly at the movements of their lips. The CAMERA is on this; the dialogue is only background. 
MARTHA 
(SNIPPING) First Itm gonna cut off this doe- torts leg, one, two, now then -- 
PERCY Why you cuttin' off that doctor's legs? 
BATE (for the thousandth time) Helen. She is dorm the steps at once to them, seizing Ii LE'TT S wrists and lifting her off IARTHA. VINE= runs in and chases MARTHA and PERCY OFF.

IC'ELLER The child's been to speci lists everywhere. The- couldn't help her in Baltimore or 1,1 -7aslaington, could they?

KELLER I said no, Katie. 
0 AUNT EV Why, writing does no harm, Arthur, only a little bitty letter. To see if they can help her. 
FELLER They can't. 
KATE We won't know that; to be a fact, Captain, until afLLer you write. 13. HELEN NOW IS GROPING AMONG THING.' ON FELL ER t S DESK, AND 
(PLACATING) You really ought to put her away, Father. 
KATE (Staring up) What? 
JAMES Some asylum. It's the kindest thing. 
AUNT EV Why, she's your sister, James, not a nobody -- 
(CONTINUED) 
14. CONTINUED HELEN pushes the buttons into the doll's face. KATE 0 now sees, comes swiftly to kneel, lifts HELEN'S hand to her own eyes in question. 
KATE Eyes? HELEN nods energetically. She wants the doll to have eyes. Another kind of silence now, while KATE takes pins and buttons from the sewing basket and attaches them to the doll as eyes. KELLER stands, caught, and watches morosely, AUNT EV blinks and conceals her emotion by inspecting her dress. 
AUNT EV My goodness me, I'm not decent. 
KELLER Helen! All are in commotion, the baby screams, but HELEN un- perturbed is lying her doll in its place, KATE on her

KATE 
(FLARING) How can you discipline an afflicted child? Is it her fault? 0 HELEN'S fingers have fluttered to her Mother's lips, vainly trying to comprehend their movements; we are close on these two. 
KELLER I didn't say it was her fault. 
KATE Then whose? I don't know what to dot How can I teach her, beat her -- until she's black and blue?

ANAGNOS 
(SEVERELY) Nowhere but back to that dreadful place where children learn to be saucy. Annie, I know how unhappy it was there, but that battle is dead and done with. Why not let it stay buried? 
ANNIE 
(CHEERILY) I think God must owe me a resur- rection. 
I -- But she swallows over getting the ring on her finger and cannot continue until she finds a woebegone joke. 
Well, what should I say -- I'm an ignorant, opinionated girl and everything I am I owe to you? 
ANAGNOS 
(SMILES) That is only half true, Annie. 
19. CONTINUED 0 Passengers behind ANNIE turn reacting to her shout. She is conscious of this and sinks down'in seat. Past ANNIE, through window of train, we see ANAGNOS join 5 or 6 blind girls on the platform, and the train departs.

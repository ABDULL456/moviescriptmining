INT. PASTELS RESTAURANT- NIGHT 
An insanely expensive restaurant on the Upper East Side. The decor is a mixture of chi-chi and rustic, with swagged silk curtains, handwritten menus and pale pink tablecloths decorated with arrangements of moss, twigs and hideous exotic flowers. The clientele is young, wealthy and confident, dressed in the height of late-eighties style: pouffy Lacroix dresses, slinky Alaïa, Armani power suits. 
CLOSE-UP on a WAITER reading out the specials. 
WAITER With goat cheese profiteroles and I also have an arugula Caesar salad. For entrées tonight I have a swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade, a rare-roasted partridge breast in raspberry coulis with a sorrel timbale... 
Huge white porcelain plates descend on very pale pink linen table cloths. Each of the entrees is a rectangle about four inches square and look exactly alike. 
CLOSE-UP on various diners as we hear fragments of conversation. "Is that Charlie Sheen over there?" "Excuse me? I ordered cactus pear sorbet." 
WAITER And grilled free-range rabbit with herbed French fries. Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli in a lemon grass broth... 
CLOSE-UP on porcelain plates containing elaborate perpendicular desserts descending on another table. 
PATRICK BATEMAN, TIMOTHY PRICE, CRAIG MCDERMOTT and DAVID VAN PATTEN are at a table set for four. They are all wearing expensively cut suits and suspenders and have slicked-back hair. Van Patten wears horn-rimmed glasses. 
The camera moves in on Bateman as his narration begins: 
BATEMAN (V.O.) We're sitting in Pastels, this nouvelle Northern California place on the Upper East Side. 
The Waiter sets down plates containing tiny, elaborately decorated starters. As he does so we hear Bateman's description of each of the men at the table. 
BATEMAN (V.O.) You'll notice that my friends and I all look and behave in a remarkably similar fashion, but there are subtle differences between us. McDermott is the biggest asshole. Van Patten is the yes man. Price is the most wired. I'm the best looking. We all have light tans. Right now I'm in a bad mood because this is not a good table, and Van Patten keeps asking dumb, obvious questions about how to dress . 
VAN PATTEN What are the rules for a sweater vest? 
McDERMOTT What do you mean? 
PRICE Yes. Clarify. 
McDERMOTT Well, is it strictly informal- 
BATEMAN Or can it be worn with a suit? 
McDERMOTT (Smiling) Exactly 
BATEMAN With discreet pinstripes you should wear a subdued blue or charcoal gray vest. A plaid suit would cal I for a bolder vest. 
McDERMOTT But avoid matching the vest's pattern with your socks or tie. Wearing argyle socks with an argyle vest will look too studied. 
VAN PATTEN You think so? 
PRICE You'll look like you consciously worked for the look. 
VAN PATTEN Good point. Excuse me, gentlemen. 
Van Patten leaves the table. As he does so, a busboy discreetly removes their largely untouched plates. 
BATEMAN Van Patten looks puffy. Has he stopped working out? 
PRICE It looks that way, doesn't it? 
McDERMOTT (Staring at retreating waiter) Did he just take our plates away? 
PRICE He took them away because the portions are so small he probably thought we were finished. God, I hate this place. This is a chicks' restaurant. Why aren't we at Dorsia? 
McDERMOTT Because Bateman won't give the maitre d' head. (He guffaws) 
Bateman throws a swizzle stick at him. 
McDermott scans the room, settling on a handsome young man with slicked-back hair and horn-rimmed glasses. 
McDERMOTT Is that Reed Robinson over there? PRICE Are you freebasing or what? That's not Robinson. 
Jean follows him into his office. 
JEAN Oh? And what should I say? 
BATEMAN Just...say...no. 
JEAN Just say no? 
Jean stands at his desk, waiting for instructions. 
BATEMAN Okay, Jean. I need reservations for three at Camols at twelve-thirty, and if not there, try Crayons. All right? 
JEAN (Playfully) Yes, sir. 
She turns to leave. 
BATEMAN Oh wait. And I need reservations for two at Arcadia at eight tonight. 
Jean turns around. 
JEAN Oh, something. . romantic? 
BATEMAN No, silly. Forget it. I'll make them. Thanks. 
JEAN I'll do it. 
BATEMAN No. No. Be a doll and just get me a Perrier, okay? 
JEAN You look nice today. 
Jean exits. Bateman straightens some magazines in his office, lifts a painting off the wall and puts it back at a slightly different angle. He fiddles with some pencils in a beer stein. He puts on some MUSIC and flips through a Sports Illustrated. He buzzes Jean. She comes in a moment later with the Perrier and a file. 
JEAN Yes? 
BATEMAN Is that the Ransom file? Thanks. Don't wear that outfit again. 
JEAN Ummm...what? I didn't hear you. 
BATEMAN I said "Do not wear that outfit again." Wear a dress. A skirt or something. 
Jean stands there, then looks down at herself. 
JEAN (Smiling bravely) You don't like this, I take it? 
BATEMAN Come on, you're prettier than that. 
JEAN (Sarcastically) Thanks, Patrick. 
The phone RINGS and Jean turns to leave. 
BATEMAN I'm not here. And high heels. I like high heels. 
As Jean leaves, Bateman clicks on the TV set in one corner of the room and starts watching Jeopardy! 
INT. TAXI - EVENING 
EVELYN WILLIAMS, Patrick Bateman's fiancée, is making notes with a gold Cross pen and sipping a bottle of mineral water. Evelyn is blonde, classically beautiful, expensively educated, and utterly pleased with herself. She usually addresses Patrick as if he were a small child. 
EVELYN I'd want a zydeco band, Patrick. That's what I'd want, a zydeco band. Or mariachi. Or reggae. Something ethnic to shock Daddy Oh, I can't decide...And lots of chocolate truffles. Godiva. And oysters on the halfshell. 
CLOSE-UP on Bateman, who is wearing a Walkman and staring out the window. 
BATEMAN (V.O.) I'm trying to listen to the new George Michael tape but Evelyn-my supposed fiancée-keeps buzzing in my ear. 
Evelyn continues to make notes. 
EVELYN Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it. 
BATEMAN (Removing his Walkman) Do...what. 
EVELYN Get married. Have a wedding. 
BATEMAN Evelyn? 
EVELYN Yes, darling? 
BATEMAN Well, we have to end apartheid for one. And slow down the nuclear arms race, stop terrorism and world hunger. But we can't ignore our social needs. either We have to stop people from abusing the welfare system. We have to provide food and shelter for the homeless and oppose racial discrimination and promote civil rights while also promoting equal rights for women but change the abortion laws to protect the right to life yet still somehow maintain women's freedom of choice. 
The table stares at Bateman uncomfortably. 
BATEMAN We also have to control the influx of illegal immigrants. We have to encourage a return to traditional moral values and curb graphic sex and violence on TV, in movies, in pop music, everywhere. Most importantly we have to promote general social concern and less materialism in young people. 
Price chokes on his drink. Everyone is silent and mystified. 
CARRUTHERS Patrick, how thought-provoking. 
INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - LATER THE SAME EVENING 
Bateman and Evelyn are lying on her bed watching television. 
BATEMAN Why don t you just go for Price? 
EVELYN Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price? 
BATEMAN He's rich. 
EVELYN Everybody's rich. 
BATEMAN He's good-looking. 
EVELYN Everybody's good-looking, Patrick. 
BATEMAN He has a great body 
EVELYN Everybody has a great body now. 
Bateman unbuttons his shirt and makes advances to get Evelyn to have sex with him. She ignores him, watching the Home Shopping Channel with the remote in her hand. Finally, he straddles her, penis close to her face. She tries to look around him at the TV, then takes notice. 
EVELYN What do you want to do with that, floss with it? 
Bateman flops back down beside her and stares at the television. 
EVELYN Are you using minoxidil? 
BATEMAN No. I'm not. Why should I ? 
EVELYN Your hairline looks like it's receding. 
BATEMAN It's not. 
EXT. STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT 
It is 3 a.m. Bateman is standing at an ATM, listening to the comforting sound of fresh bills thudding out of the machine. Bateman turns around and watches a solitary young woman walk past him. He collects his money, placing it carefully in his wallet, and then walks toward her, whistling. He catches up to her as she pauses at a red light. 
BATEMAN Hello. 
The woman looks suspicious for a moment and then, seeing his smile, smiles back. 
INT. DRY CLEANERS - DAY 
Bateman, dressed in an Armani suit with an unlit cigar between his teeth is standing in a dry cleaners, arguing with the Chinese woman behind the counter. 
BATEMAN Listen, wait. You're not...shhh wait... you're not giving me valid reasons. 
The woman continues to speak to him in another language, grabbing at the sleeve of the jacket. 
BATEMAN What are you trying to say to me? 
Her husband has taken Bateman's horribly bloodstained sheets out of the bag and is staring at them. 
BATEMAN Bleach-ee? Are you trying to say bleach-ee? Bleach-ee. Oh my God. 
She keeps pointing to the jacket and talking. 
BATEMAN (Talking over her) Two things. One. You can't bleach a Soprani. Out of the question. Two. (Louder) Two. I can only get these sheets in Santa Fe. These are very expensive sheets and I really need them clean. 
She keeps talking and Bateman leans into her. 
BATEMAN If you don't shut your fucking mouth I will kill you, are you understanding me? 
She talks faster. 
Bateman pulls the pillow off her and slaps her face. 
BATEMAN Oh Christ, this really isn't worth it. And see, Courtney, it's there for what? Huh? Tell us. (He slaps her again lightly) Why is it pulled down half an inch? So it can catch the force of the ejaculate! 
COURTNEY (Choking crying) Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS. 
Bateman grabs her head and makes her look at the condom. 
BATEMAN See? Happy? You dumb bitch? Are you happy, you dumb bitch? 
COURTNEY Oh God, just get it over with. 
He fucks her quickly until he has a mediocre orgasm and falls down next to her. They lie side by side with their bodies not touching, eyes open, staring at the ceiling. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM, PIERCE & PIERCE - DAY 
Bateman and Luis Carruthers are seated at a long table in the conference room at Pierce & Pierce, which looks out onto a spectacular view of Manhattan. 
CARRUTHERS Patrick, thanks so much for looking after Courtney. Dorsia, how impressive! How on earth did you get a reservation there? 
BATEMAN Lucky, I guess. 
CARRUTHERS That's a wonderful jacket. Let me guess, Valentino Couture? 
BATEMAN Uh huh. 
CARRUTHERS (Reaching out to touch it) It looks so soft. 
BATEMAN (Catching Luis hand) Your compliment was sufficient Luis. 
Carruthers is distracted by a question from the colleague on his left.Paul Owen enters, carrying the Wall St. Journal under his arm. He is handsome, supremely confident and self-satisfied; he sees himself as a leader among men. 
OWEN (To Bateman) Hello, Halberstam. Nice tie. How the hell are you? 
BATEMAN I've been great. And you? 
Their conversation fades down as we hear Bateman's thoughts. 
BATEMAN (V.O.) Owen has mistaken me for this dickhead Marcus Halberstam. It seems logical because Marcus also works at P&P and in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant for Valentino suits and Oliver Peoples glasses. Marcus and I even go to the same barber, although I have a slightly better haircut. 
During this voiceover the CAMERA WANDERS over to MARCUS HALBERSTAM, who is conferring with a colleague in the opposite corner of the room. He bears a superficial resemblance to Bateman. 
OWEN How's the Ransom account going, Marcus? 
BATEMAN (Nervous) It's...it's...all right. 
OWEN Really? That's interesting. (He stares at Bateman, smiling) Not great? 
BATEMAN Oh well, you know. 
OWEN And how's Cecilia? She's a great girl. 
BATEMAN Oh yes. I'm very lucky. 
McDermott and Price enter. 
McDERMOTT Hey. Owen! Congratulations on the Fisher account. 
OWEN Thank you, Baxter. 
PRICE Listen, Paul. Squash? 
OWEN Call me. (Hands him a business card) 
PRICE How about Friday? 
OWEN No can do. Got a res at eight-thirty at Dorsia. Great sea urchin ceviche. There is a stunned silence as he walks away and sits in a corner of the room, ostentatiously studying papers. 
CLOSE-UP on Bateman's face, cold with hatred. 
PRICE (Whispering) Jesus. Dorsia? On a Friday night? How'd he swing that? 
McDERMOTT (Whispering) I think he's lying. 
Bateman takes out his wallet and pulls out a card. 
BATEMAN Is this what you need? 
The Homeless Man nods, looks away, wipes his nose. 
HOMELESS MAN I'm so hungry. 
BATEMAN It's cold out, too, isn't it? 
HOMELESS MAN I'm so hungry. 
BATEMAN (Holding the bill just out of the man's reach) Why don't you get a job? If you're so hungry, why don't you get a job? 
HOMELESS MAN (Shivering and sobbing) I lost my job... 
BATEMAN Why? Were you drinking? Is that why you lost it? Insider trading? Just joking. No, really-were you drinking on the job? 
HOMELESS MAN I was fired. I was laid off. 
BATEMAN Gee, uh, that's too bad. 
HOMELESS MAN I'm so hungry. 
The dog starts to whimper. 
BATEMAN Why don't you get another one? Why don't , you get another job? 
HOMELESS MAN I'm not... 
BATEMAN You're not what? Qualified for anything else? 
HOMELESS MAN I'm hungry 
BATEMAN I know that, I know that. Jeez, you're like a broken record. I'm trying to help you. 
HOMELESS MAN I'm hungry. 
BATEMAN Listen, do you think it's fair to take money from people who do have jobs? From people who do work? 
HOMELESS MAN What am I gonna do? 
BATEMAN Listen, what's your name? 
HOMELESS MAN Al. 
BATEMAN Speak up. Come on. 
HOMELESS MAN Al. 
BATEMAN Get a goddamn job, Al. You've got a negative attitude. That's what's stopping you. You've got to get your act together. I'll help you. 
HOMELESS MAN You re so kind, mister. You're kind. You're a kind man. I can tell. 
BATEMAN (Petting the dog) Shhhh...it's okay. 
HOMELESS MAN (Grabbing Bateman's wrist) Please...I don know what to do. I'm so cold. 
BATEMAN (Stroking his face, whispering) Do ,you know how bad you smell? The stench, my God. 
HOMELESS MAN I can't...I can't find a shelter 
BATEMAN You reek. You reek of...shit. Do you know that? (Shouting) Goddammit, Al-look at me and stop crying like some kind of faggot. Al...I'm sorry. 
Bateman carefully puts the money back in his wallet. 
BATEMAN It's just that...I don't know I don't have anything in common with you. 
He opens his briefcase and pulls out a long thin knife with a serrated edge. He pushes up the sleeve of his jacket to protect it. 
BATEMAN Do you know what a fucking loser ,you are? 
HOMELESS MAN'S POV as Bateman lunges at him with the knife. 
EXTREME WIDE SHOT of the street. Bateman's shadowed figure is hunched over the Homeless Man, stabbing him in the stomach. The dog barks wildly and Bateman stomps on it until it is silent. 
LOW ANGLE shot of Bateman as he throws a quarter on the ground. 
OWEN I could tell you that, Halberstam, but then I'd have to kill you. 
He guffaws. Bateman laughs politely. 
LATER: Paul Owen is very drunk. BATEMAN cold sober. 
BATEMAN I like to dissect girls. Did you know I'm utterly insane? 
Owen continues laughing and motions to the waiter for another drink. 
OWEN Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive. Where do you tan? 
BATEMAN Salon. 
OWEN I've got a tanning bed at home. You should look into it. 
Bateman nods, agitated. 
OWEN And Cecelia, how is she? Where is she tonight? 
BATEMAN Cecelia is, well...you know (Cecelia. I think she's having dinner with...Evelyn Williams. 
OWEN Evelyn. Great ass. Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman. What a dork. 
BATEMAN Another Martini, Paul? 
Owen nods drunkenly. 
LATER: 
The end of the meal. Owen is squeezing a lime onto the table, missing his beer, incredibly drunk. The check is laid down. 
BATEMAN (Talking to Owen like a child) Paul, give me your Amex card. Good boy. Bateman slaps the card down, looks at the check. 
BATEMAN Two-hundred-and-fifty. Very reasonable. Let's leave a big tip, shall we? My place hr a nightcap? 
OWEN No, man. I'm gonna bail. 
BATEMAN Come on, you dumb son of a bitch. (Helping him into his jacket) I've got a preview of the Barneys catalogue and a bottle of Absolut waiting for us. 
INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT The living room floor has been meticulously covered with newspaper. 
Owen is slumped drunkenly in a white Eames chair, a glass in his hand. Bateman is looking through his CDs. 
BATEMAN You like Huey Lewis and the News? 
OWEN They're okay. BATEMAN Their early work was a little too New Wave for my taste. But then Sports came out in 1983, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. 
Bateman walks to his bathroom, taking a large ax out of the shower. He takes two Valium. 
BATEMAN (Said partly from the bathroom) The whole album has a clear, crisp sound and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that gives the songs a big boost. Bateman comes back out and leans the ax against the wall. He walks to the foyer and puts on a raincoat, watching Owen from behind ail the time. 
BATEMAN He's been compared to ELvis Costello but I think Huey has a more bitter, cynical sense of humor. 
Owen is absent-mindedly leafing through the Barneys catalogue. 
OWEN Hey, Halberstam? 
BATEMAN Yes, Owen? 
OWEN Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you have a dog? A chow or something? 
BATEMAN No, Owen. 
OWEN (Confused) Is that a raincoat? 
BATEMAN Yes, it is. 
Bateman moves to the CD player. He takes a CD out of its case and slides it in the machine. 
BATEMAN In 1987 Huey released this, Fore!, their most accomplished album. I think I heir undisputed masterpiece is "HiP To Be Square," a song so catchy that most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's al~ a personal statement about the band itself. 
Bateman puts on "Hip To Be Square." 
BATEMAN crosses the room and picks up the ax. 
Bateman is sitting at his desk, with the latest copy of Sports Illustrated in front of him and his Walkman playing Kenny G. We hear the MUSIC until Jean enters and he takes the Walkman off. 
BATEMAN (Faintly irritable) What is it? 
JEAN Patrick? 
BATEMAN (Condescendingly) Ye-es, Je-an? 
JEAN Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you. 
BATEMAN Who? 
JEAN Detective Donald KIMBALL? 
Silence. Bateman stares out the window, then down at the drawing of a headless woman he's been doodling on the back cover of Sports Illustrated. 
BATEMAN Tell him I'm at lunch. 
JEAN (whispering) Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty. 
Silence. 
BATEMAN Send him in, I guess. As she exits, he picks up the cordless phone and pretends to talk to someone at the other end. 
BATEMAN Now, John, you've got to wear clothes in proportion to your physique. There are definite do's and don'ts, good buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt. A hold-striped shirt calls for solid-colored or discreetly patterned suits and ties... 
The door to the office opens and he waves in DETECTIVE DONALD KIMBALL. KIMBALL is surprisingly young - about Bateman's age - and good-looking, dressed in a crumpled linen Armani suit of the type Bateman and his friends might wear. 
Kimball sits down and crosses his legs with a self-assurance that makes Bateman so nervous he forgets to carry on with his fake conversation. Kimball looks up at him curiously, noticing the silence. 
BATEMAN (Realizing that Kimball is staring at him) Right. And yes...always tip the stylist fifteen percent. 
Bateman shrugs at the detective, rolling his eyes in exasperation. 
KIMBALL nods understandingly. 
BATEMAN Listen, John, I've got to go. T Boone Pickens just walked in... (He laughs inanely) Just joking... (Pause) No don't tip the owner of the salon. Okay, John, right, got it. (He hangs up the phone and pushes the antenna in) Sorry about that. 
KIMBALL No, I'm sorry. I should've made an appointment. (Gesturing toward the phone) Was that anything important? 
BATEMAN Oh that? Just mulling over business problems. Examining opportunities...Exchanging rumors... Spreading gossip. 
They laugh politely. 
KIMBALL (Holding out his hand) Hi. I'm Donald KIMBALL 
BATEMAN (Shaking firmly) Hi. Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you. 
KIMBALL I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. but I was supposed to talk to Luis Carruthers and he wasn't in and...well, you're here, so...I know how busy you guys can get. 
KIMBALL stares at the three open copies of Sports Illustrated and the Sony Walkman lying on Bateman's desk. Bateman sees the look and sweeps the magazines into the top drawer along with the Walkman, which is still running. 
BATEMAN (Forcing himself to sound friendly and relaxed) So, what's the topic of discussion? 
KIMBALL I've been hired by Meredith Powell to investigate the disappearance of Paul Owen. 
BATEMAN You're not with the FBI or anything, are you? 
KIMBALL Nothing like that. I'm just a private investigator. 
BATEMAN Ah, I see...Yes. Paul's disappearance...Yes. 
KIMBALL So it's nothing that official. I just have some basic questions. About Paul Owen. About yourself- 
BATEMAN Coffee? 
KIMBALL No. I'm okay. 
BATEMAN Perrier? San Pellegrino? 
KIMBALL No, I'm okay. 
KIMBALL takes out a small black notepad and the same gold Cross pen that Bateman and his friends all use. Bateman buzzes Jean. 
JEAN (O.S.) Patrick? 
A perfectly lit kitchen still-life - a bottle of Evian, a white porcelain plate on which sits a sliced kiwi, some perfect green grapes, a few berries. 
OFFSCREEN, the SOUND OF SCREAMS AND A CHAINSAW can be heard from the living room. 
The living room: Bateman is maniacally doing abdominal crunches as the television plays a video of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. There is a pile of horror videos on his coffee table, next to a copy of GQ. 
LATER: 
Bateman is sitting in his armchair, phone book in hand, jerking off. He is squealing into the phone and breathing. 
BATEMAN You like that, slut? 
The person on the other end clearly hangs up. 
CLOSE-UP on his fingers dialing the phone. 
BATEMAN You want to know what I'm wearing? Sixty-dollar boxer shorts by Ralph Lauren, a hundred-and-fifty-dollar white cotton T-shirt by Commes des Garcons. (He snorts like a pig) My Rolex cost- 
Another hang-up. He dials again. 
BATEMAN (Whipering) I'm a corporate raider. I orchestrate hostile takeovers. What do you think of that? (Makes disgusting sucking noises and grunts) Huh, bitch? 
GIRL (O.S.) Dad, is that you? 
Bateman hangs up, frustrated. 
EXT. STREET/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
Bateman cruises around in the limo. It pulls up alongside CHRISTIE, a pretty blonde hooker in shorts and leather jacket. Bateman opens his window to speak to her. 
BATEMAN I haven't seen you around here. 
CHRISTIE You just haven't been looking. 
BATEMAN Would you like to see my apartment? 
Bateman flips on the light inside the limo. He's wearing a tuxedo. 
CHRISTIE (looking away to some dark corner) I'm not supposed to. 
Bateman is holding out a $100 bill, which Christie now notices, then takes. 
BATEMAN Do you want to come to my apartment or not? 
CHRISTIE I'm not supposed to. (She pockets the bill) But I can make an exception. 
BATEMAN Do you take American Express? 
Christie is still looking out behind her. 
BATEMAN Do you take American Express? 
Christie looks at him like he's crazy. 
BATEMAN I'm joking. Come on, get in. 
As they drive uptown, Bateman dials the cell-phone. He reads off a credit card number. 
BATEMAN I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde, who does couples. Couples. Fifty-five West Eighty-First, the American Gardens Building. Apartment 7C. And I really can't stress blonde enough. Blonde. 
He hangs up. 
BATEMAN I'm Paul. My name is Paul 0wen, have you'got that? You are Christie. You are to respond only to Christie. Is that clear? 
INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Christie is in the bathtub, Bateman is pouring in white milky bath oil. 
BATEMAN That's a very fine Chardonnay you're drinking. 
Long pause, in which Christie is luxuriating in the tub and Bateman is casually touching her breast. 
BATEMAN I want you to clean your vagina. 
Christie reaches for a washcloth. 
He turns on the video camera. 
BATEMAN Christie, get down on your knees, so Sabrina can see your asshole. 
Bateman looks through the viewfinder. 
BATEMAN Phill Collins solo efforts seem to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way, especially songs like "In the Air Tonight" and "Against All Odds." Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it. 
He walks over to the sound system in his bedroom and slides in the CD. 
BATEMAN But I also think that Phill Collins works better within the confines of the group than as a solo artist-and I stress the word artist. This is "Sussudio," a great, great song, a personal favorite. 
SEX MONTAGE CUT TO "Sussudio." We see this in WIDE SHOT, or through the LENS OF THE VIDEO CAMERA. 
CUT TO: 
Bateman asleep in his bed with Christie and Sabrina on either side of him. Sabrina accidentally touches his wrist. Bateman's eyes open. 
BATEMAN Don't touch the Rolex. 
Bateman gets up from his bed and goes over to his armoire. 
He opens the drawer in which are a nail gun, a coat hanger, a rusty butter knife and a half-smoked cigar. He turns around to see Christie and Sabrina both starting to get up and get dressed. He takes the coat hanger. 
BATEMAN We're not through yet... 
CUT TO: 
Bateman ushering them out the door impatiently. They are both sobbing, badly bruised and bleeding. Bateman has a deep scratch on his hand and one on his shoulder. In the b.g. Phil Collins' "In the Air Tonight" is playing. 
INT. YALE CLUB  DAY 
McDermott, Van Patten and Bateman are having drinks. Price walks by with a gorgeous girl and gives them the finger. 
BATEMAN What an asshole. 
McDERMOTT Why is Laurie Kennedy dating Price? He's a fucking drug addict. No self-control. 
VAN PATTEN But Laurie Kennedy is a total hardbody. What do you think, Bateman? 
BATEMAN I know her. I knew her. 
McDERMOTT Why do you say it like that? Why does he say it like that? 
VAN PATTEN Because he dated her. 
BATEMAN How did you guess? 
VAN PATTEN Girls dig Bateman. He's CQ. You're total CQ, Bateman. 
BATEMAN Thanks, guy, but...she's got a lousy personality. 
McDERMOTT So what? It's all looks. Laurie Kennedy is a babe. Don't even pretend you were interested for any other reason. 
VAN PATTEN If they have a good personality, then something is very wrong. 
McDERMOTT If they have a good personality and they are not great looking-who fucking cares? 
BATEMAN Well, let's just say hypothetically, okay? What if they have a good personality? (He smiles giving up) I know, I know- 
ALL IN UNISON There are no girls with good personalities! (They laugh and high-five each other) 
VAN PATTEN A good personality consists of a chick with a little hardbody who will satisfy all sexual demands without being too slutty about things and who will essentially keep her dumb fucking mouth shut. 
McDERMOTT Listen, the only girls with good personalities who are smart or maybe funny or halfway intelligent or even talented-though God knows what the fuck that means-are ugly chicks. 
VAN PATTEN Absolutely. 
McDERMOTT And this is because they have to make up for how fucking unattractive they are. 
Pause. 
BATEMAN Do you know what Ed Gein said about women? 
VAN PATTEN Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar? 
BATEMAN What? CARRUTHERS (Silently mouthing the words) I'll call you. 
Bateman storms out of the restaurant. 
INT. COURTNEY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Bateman is lying on top of Courtney in her bed, after sex. Still panting, he rolls off her, onto his back. He feels something lumpy underneath him and pulls out a stuffed toy, a black cat with blue jewel eyes. There is silence. 
COURTNEY Will you call me before Thanksgiving? 
BATEMAN Maybe. 
Courtney sighs and reaches for a bottle of pills on her nightstand, swallowing several. Bateman gets up and begins to dress, admiring himself in the mirror. Courtney watches the TV at low volume. 
COURTNEY What are you doing tonight? 
BATEMAN Dinner at the River Cafe. Au Bar afterwards, maybe. 
COURTNEY That's nice. 
BATEMAN You and...Luis? 
COURTNEY (Lighting a cigarette) We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is... 
BATEMAN I never knew you smoked. 
COURTNEY (Smiling sadly) You never noticed. 
Bateman is making final adjustments to his tie. 
COURTNEY Listen...Patrick. Can we talk? 
BATEMAN You look marvelous. There's nothing to say. You're going to marry Luis. Next week, no Less. 
COURTNEY (Sarcastically) Isn't that special? (A pause) Patrick? 
BATEMAN Yes, Courtney? 
C0URTNEY If I don't see you before Thanksgiving, have a nice one, okay? 
BATEMAN (Flatly) You too. 
Courtney picks up the black cat and starts petting its head. Bateman heads down the hallway to the front door. 
COURTNEY Patrick? 
BATEMAN Yes? 
COURTNEY Nothing. 
INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 
A big eighties nightclub with a mixed crowd: hip-hop kids, visitors from Jersey, downtown art people, yuppies. 
I Bateman makes his way through the crowd to the bar, and tries to attract the bartender's attention. He is wearing a suit and his tie is loosened. Kimball approaches him. 
KIMBALL Mr. Bateman? 
Bateman gasps and recovers. 
BATEMAN Detective Kendall...uh Campbell? KIMBALL Kimball. (Extending his hand) Call me Don. 
BATEMAN Don. 
KIMBALL So...you hang out here a lot? 
BATEMAN Uh, yes...I mean...whenever necessary. You know. 
Pause. 
BATEMAN How's the investigation going? Taken anyone in for "formal questioning?" (He makes quotation marks in the air and laughs a not-so-relaxed laugh) 
KIMBALL 0h no. Informal conversations, mostly. What's that, Stoli? 
BATEMAN Yeah. No Finlandia, as usual. Fucking dump. 
MUCH LATER IN THE EVENING: 
The club is half-empty now. Price is leaning over a balcony, messed-up on drugs. Bateman comes up behind him in a menacing way that suggests he might push him over the railing. Price turns around, wild-eyed, just as Bateman is reaching for him. 
PRICE (Shouting) I'm leaving. I'm getting out. 
BATEMAN Leaving what? 
PRICE This. 
Bateman is confused, he thinks Price is referring to his drink. 
BATEMAN Don't, I'll drink it. 
PRICE (Screaming) Listen to me, Patrick. I'm leaving. 
BATEMAN Where to? Are you going to go get a gram? 
PRICE I'm leaving! I...am...leaving! 
BATEMAN Don't tell me...merchant banking? 
PRICE No, you dumb son of a bitch. I'm serious. I'm disappearing. 
BATEMAN (laughing) Where to? Morgan Stanley? Rehab? What? 
Price looks away. 
McDermott and Daisy walk up to them. 
McDERMOTT Hey-don't worry, be happy. 
Price lifts his arms up as if greeting the crowd and is shouting something that can't be heard, then 
PRICE Goodbye! Fuckheads! 
He climbs over the railing. 
DAISY What is he doing? 
BATEMAN Price! Come back! 
Price leaps from the balcony. He disappears for a moment then resurfaces and runs off into the crowd. 
EXT. CLUB - NIGHT Bateman and Daisy are waiting for a cab. 
DAISY My ex-boyfriend, Fiddler, who was in there, he plays in this band that just opened for U2-he couldn't understand what I was doing with a yuppie. 
BATEMAN Oh really? DAISY He said... (She laughs) He said you gave him bad vibes. 
BATEMAN That's...that's too bad. 
DAISY You think I'm dumb, don't you? 
BATEMAN What? 
DAISY You think I'm dumb. You think all models are dumb. 
BATEMAN (insincerely) No. I really don't. 
DAISY That's okay. I don't mind. There's something sweet about you. 
She takes his hand as they get into a cab. 
INT. DAISY'S HALLWAY - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Bateman leaves Daisy's apartment carrying a suitcase. He pauses in the hallway and tucks some long blonde hair back inside the case. 
INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Bateman sits at his desk wearing Wayfarers doing the New York Times crossword puzzle at dusk. 
Jean knocks gently on the half-open door and walks in with a folder in her hand. Bateman ignores her. 
JEAN Doin' the crossword? 
BATEMAN They know me. 
Pause. 
BATEMAN Why don't you meet me at my house at seven o'clock for drinks, okay? 
She turns to leave. 
BATEMAN And Jean? You'll want to change before we go out. 
INT. BATEMAN'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING 
Jean stands by the floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out. 
JEAN Patrick, it's so...elegant. What a wonderful view. 
Bateman opens up the freezer where Daisy's head is cleady visible. 
BATEMAN Jean? Sorbet? 
JEAN Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some. 
Bateman walks in with a bottle of wine and a corkscrew in his hand and hands her the sorbet. 
Jean is eating the sorbet. 
JEAN Want a bite? 
BATEMAN I'm on a diet. But thank you. 
JEAN You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit. 
BATEMAN (Weighing the corkscrew examining the point for sharpness) You can always he thinner. Look...better. 
JEAN Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower. 
BATEMAN No. It's all right. I'm not very good at controlling it anyway. 
Silence, as Bateman walks around his apartment, opens up his knife drawer, looking at the knives. 
BATEMAN So listen, what do you really want to do with your life? 
Pause. 
BATEMAN And don't tell me you enjoy working with children, okay? 
JEAN Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure. 
Bateman is touching a knife in the drawer, feeling the edge of the blade. 
BATEMAN Do you have a boyfriend? 
JEAN No, not really. 
BATEMAN Interesting. 
JEAN (Shyly) Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously? 
BATEMAN Maybe. I don't know Not really. Bateman opens up a cupboard where there are a lot of very Bateman opens a cupboard where there are a lot of neatly ordered weapons - an ax, a rifle, a chain saw, duct tape, twine and a nail gun. 
BATEMAN Jean, do you feel...fulfilled? I mean, in your life? 
JEAN Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing. 
BATEMAN Growing. I'm glad you said that. 
Bateman picks up the duct tape. 
BATEMAN Did you know that Ted Bundy's first dog, a collie, was named Lassie? Had you heard this? 
JEAN Who's Ted Bundy? 
BATEMAN Forget it. 
JEAN What's that? 
A pause. 
KIMBALL Do you remember where you were on the night of Paul's disappearance? (He checks his notebook) Which was on the twentieth of December? 
BATEMAN God...I guess...I was probably returning videotapes. 
He opens his desk drawer and pretends to search through his diary. 
BATEMAN I had a date with a girl named Veronica. 
KIMBALL Wait. That's not what I've got. 
BATEMAN What? 
KIMBALL That's not the information I've received. 
BATEMAN Well...I...Wait...What information have you received? 
KIMBALL Let's see... (He flips through his notebook) That you were with- 
BATEMAN Well, I could he wrong. 
KIMBALL Well...When was the last time you were with Paul Owen? 
BATEMAN (Clearly nervous and under pressure) We had...gone to a new musical called...Oh Africa, Brave Africa. It was...a laugh riot...and that's about it. I think we had dinner at Orso's. No, Petaluma. No, Orso's. The...last time I physically saw him was...at an automated teller. I can't remember which...just one that was near, um, Nell's. 
Kimball is clearly giving up on Bateman for now. He opens his briefcase to put away his notebook. 
KIMBALL Well, thank you, Mr. Bateman. 
BATEMAN Patrick, please. I hope I've been informative. Long day-a bit scattered. 
KIMBALL Listen, I'm a little spent for now but how about lunch in a week or so when I've sorted out all this information? 
BATEMAN Great, yes, I'd like that. 
KIMBALL And if you could try and pin down where you were the night of Owen's disappearance, it would make my job a lot easier. 
BATEMAN Absolutely. I'm with you on that one. 
Kimball is rifling through his briefcase. He pulls out a new shrink wrapped CD and holds it up. 
KIMBALL Huey Lewis and the News. Great stuff. Heard it? I just bought it on my way here. 
Bateman stares at the CD - stunned, terrified. 
BATEMAN Never. I mean...I don't really like... singers. 
KIMBALL Not a big music fan, eh? 
BATEMAN No, I like music. Just-they're-Huey's too... black sounding. For me. 
KIMBALL Well, to each his own. So-lunch, Thursday? I'll call your secretary about reservations. 
BATEMAN I'll be there. 
EXT. MEAT PACKING DISTRICT/INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
The same street corner where Bateman found Christie before. The limo is kept idling as he talks to her through a half-opened window. 
CHRISTIE I'm not so sure about this. I had to go to Emergency after last time... 
BATEMAN Oh this won't be anything like last time, I promise. 
CHRISTIE I don't think so. 
He hands her a $500 bill. 
BATEMAN Just come in the limo and talk to me for a minute. 
The driver's here, you'll be safe. 
Christie gets in hesitantly. 
BATEMAN Nothing like last time, promise. 
BATEMAN She's from...France. 
A pause. Elizabeth looks at Bateman dubiously. 
ELIZABETH Where's your phone? I've got to call Harley. 
Bateman hands her a cordless phone. She dials, and stares At Christie while she waits for someone to answer. 
ELIZABETH Where do you summer? Southampton? 
Christie looks at Bateman and then back at Elizabeth. 
CHRISTIE No. 
ELIZABETH (Listening to the receiver) Oh God, it's his machine. 
BATEMAN Elizabeth, it's three in the morning. 
ELIZABETH He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours. 
BATEMAN Don't tell him you're here. 
ELIZABETH Why would I? 
Bateman has poured her another glass of wine. She downs the whole glass, making a face. 
ELIZABETH This tastes weird. (She examines the label and shrugs) Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at- 
BATEMAN (Whispering) You're at Paul Owen s. 
ELIZABETH Who? 
BATEMAN (Whispering) Paul Owen. 
ELIZABETH I want the number, idiot. (She waves him away and continues into the reciever) Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you. 
She hangs up. 
ELIZABETH Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours? 
BATEMAN No. 
ELIZABETH Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon. 
Bateman sits next to Elizabeth on the couch and pours her another glass of the drugged wine. 
BATEMAN Listen, I would just like to see...the two of you...get it on. What's wrong with that? It's totally disease-free. 
ELIZABETH (Laughing) Patrick, you re a lunatic. 
BATEMAN Come on. Don't you find Christie attractive? 
ELIZABETH Let's not get lewd. (Flirty) I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation. 
BATEMAN Come on. I think it would be a turn-on. 
ELIZABETH (To Christie) Does he do this all the time? 
Christie shrugs. 
BATEMAN Christie, you're not drinking your wine. 
Christie looks at her wine and gingerly takes a sip. 
BATEMAN (To Elizabeth) Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl? 
ELIZABETH No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that? 
BATEMAN Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing. 
ELIZABETH Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird. 
LATER: 
Elizabeth is now writhing around on the couch and making out with Christie. Bateman holds up a Whitney Houston CD, showing them the picture of Whitney on the cover. 
BATEMAN I think, Evelyn, that we've...lost touch. 
Evelyn waves to a couple across the room. 
EVELYN (Distracted) Why? What's wrong? 
BATEMAN (Speaking very carefully, measuring each word) My need to engage in homicidal behavior on a massive scale cannot be, um, corrected, but I have no other way to fulfill my needs. 
The woman across the room holds up her hand, displaying a new bracelet. Evelyn smiles and nods approvingly. 
BATEMAN We need to talk. 
EVELYN Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about? 
BATEMAN It's over, Evelyn. It's all over 
EVELYN (Motioning to the waiter for water) Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee? 
BATEMAN I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us. This is no joke. I don't think we should see each other anymore. 
EVELYN But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work. (Reaching over to dab his face with a napkin) You have a little something on your upper lip. 
BATEMAN (Brushing her hand away) I know that your friends are my friends. I've thought about that. You can have them. 
Evelyn stares at him, suspicious and bewildered, a realization dawning. 
EVELYN You're really serious, aren't you? 
BATEMAN Yes, I am. 
EVELYN But what about the past? Our past? 
BATEMAN We never really shared one. 
EVELYN You're inhuman. 
BATEMAN I'm...in touch with humanity. Evelyn, I'm sorry. (He pauses, as if searching for the right words) You're just not terribly important to me. 
Evelyn begins to cry. 
EVELYN No, no, no. 
BATEMAN I know my behavior is...erratic sometimes. 
She reaches desperately across the table and takes his hand. Bateman pulls his hand away. 
EVELYN (Sobbing) What do you want me to do, what is it you want? 
The occupants of nearby tables begin to stare. Bateman is becoming increasingly agitated and embarrassed. 
BATEMAN (Looking uncomfortably around the room) If you really want to do something for me, you can stop making this scene right now. 
EVELYN Oh God, I can't believe this. 
BATEMAN I'm leaving now. I've assessed the situation and I'm going. 
Evelyn makes an effort to compose herself. She blots the tears so they will not affect her make-up. 
EVELYN (Surprisingly calm) Where are you going? 
BATEMAN I'm just leaving. 
EVELYN But where? 
BATEMAN I have to return some videotapes. 
He rushes out of the room. 
EXT. TRIBECA STREET - EVENING 
Bateman wanders into misty Tribeca streets, sees a stray cat. 
BATEMAN Here kitty, kitty. 
The small mangy cat rubs against him. He picks it up and walks toward an ATM, holding the cat. He puts his card in the machine. The screen reads: FEED ME A STRAY CAT. Bateman begins to attempt to shove the kitten into the deposit slot with some difficulty. The kitten squeals. He takes a gun from out of his pocket and points it at the kitten. He doesn't notice the woman waiting behind him. 
KIMBALL (Looking at him like he's nuts) Suit yourself, I guess. 
Pause. 
KIMBALL So, the night he disappeared? Any new thoughts on what you did? 
BATEMAN I'm not really sure. I had a shower...and some sorbet? 
KIMBALL I think maybe you've got your dates mixed up. 
BATEMAN But how? Where do you place Paul that night? 
KIMBALL According to his date book, and this was verified by his secretary, he had dinner with...Marcus Halberstam. 
BATEMAN And? 
KIMBALL I've questioned him. 
BATEMAN Marcus? 
KIMBALL Yes. And he denies it. Though at first he couldn't be sure. 
BATEMAN But Marcus denied it? 
KIMBALL Yes. 
BATEMAN Well, does Marcus have an alibi? 
KIMBALL Yes. 
A pause. 
BATEMAN He does? You're sure? 
KIMBALL (smiling) I checked it out. It's clean. 
BATEMAN Oh. KIMBALL Now where were you? (He laughs) 
BATEMAN (Laughing with him) Where was Marcus? 
KIMBALL He wasn't with Paul Owen. 
BATEMAN So who was he with? 
KIMBALL He was at Atlantis with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble, Harry Newman, George Butner and  (He pauses, Then looks up) - you. 
A moment of stunned silence. 
BATEMAN Oh, right. Of course...We had wanted Paul Owen to come. But he said he had plans...I guess I had dinner with Victoria...the following night. 
KIMBALL Personally I think the guy went a little nutso. Split town for a while. Maybe he did go to London. Sightseeing. Drinking. Whatever. Anyway, I'm pretty sure he'll turn up sooner or later. (A pause) I mean, to think that one of his friends killed him, for no reason whatsoever would be too ridiculous. Isn't that right, Patrick? 
McDermott stops by the table. 
McDERMOTT KIMBALL! How's the investigation? Talking to Bateman? Don't believe a word he says. (Laughs uproariously slapping him on the back) Bateman, what's wrong with ,you? 
Bateman looks at him in silence, panicking. 
McDERMOTT You can't eat at Smith and Wollensky without ordering the hash browns. Jesus, Bateman, you're a raving maniac. Been at Pierce & Pierce too long. (He wanders off muttering) No fucking hash browns... 
INT. PAUL OWEN'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Bateman walks into the lobby of Paul Owen's building. He has a surgical mask in one hand. 
DOORMAN What can I do for you, sir? 
BATEMAN 20B. 
DOORMAN Of course. Mrs. Wolfe is up there right now. 
BATEMAN Mrs. Wolfe? 
DOORMAN The real estate agent? You do have an appointment, don't you? 
Bateman steps out of the elevator and walks cautiously down the hallway. Owen's door is open. The apartment is freshly painted and has been immaculately redecorated in English country-house style: overstuffed sofas, lots of chintz. There are flowers everywhere, and a YOUNG YUPPIE COUPLE stands admiring the place talkingto the realtor, MRS. WOLFE. Bateman wanders down the hallway, looking for familiar signs. He stops at the closet where we last saw two dead girls hanging. He opens the door and the light switches on, but it is empty. Mrs. Wolfe approaches, smiling. 
JEAN (O.S.) Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong? 
BATEMAN I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean. 
Pause. 
BATEMAN ...to the office this afternoon. 
JEAN (O.S.) Why? 
BATEMAN (Screaming) Just...say...no! 
JEAN (O.S.) What is it, Patrick? Are you alright? 
BATEMAN Stop sounding so Fucking sad! Jesus! 
He hangs up. He throws the Walkman which is around his neck into a nearby trash can, and wipes his face with his jacket. 
INT. BATEMAN'S OFFICE- SAME DAY 
Jean sits at Bateman's desk. She looks around, and then opens his desk drawer and tentatively begins to search through it. 
INT. HARRY'S BAR - EVENING 
Bateman comes into the bar, a little cleaned up from the previous scene (he's smoothed his hair), but still panicking and disheveled. He spots his friends in a corner, sits down, still breathing heavily. 
Price is on his cell-phone, trying to get reservations. 
McDERMOTT Bateman, you're looking a little wild-eyed rough day at the office? 
They all laugh. 
McDERMOTT Hey, look-Price is back. And he's drinking Perrier. He s a changed man. Except...he still can't get a reservation to save his life. 
Bateman sits down silently. 
McDERMOTT Why don't you try I 50 Wooster? Just fucking call them. 
BATEMAN (On automatic) I'm not going anywhere unless we have a reservation. 
VAN PATTEN Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar, come on, faggots-just get a res. 
PRICE Keep your shirt on. Maybe lose the suspenders. 
Bateman spots HAROLD CARNES at the bar, tenses. 
BATEMAN (He downs his drink) Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back. He approaches Carnes cautiously. 
CARNES Face it-the Japanese will own most of this country by the end of the '90s. 
Bateman approaches, trying to act casual. 
BATEMAN Shut up, Carnes, they will not. 
Carnes is surprised, turns around, looks vaguely confused. 
BATEMAN So, Harold, did you get my message? 
Carnes lights a cigarette, stalling. Then laughs. 
CARNES Jesus, Davis. Yes. That was hilarious. That was you, wasn't it? 
BATEMAN (Waving smoke out of his face) Yes, naturally. 
CARNES Bateman killing Owen and the escort girls? Oh that s fabulous. That's rich... 
Pause 
CARNES It was a pretty long message, wasn't it? 
BATEMAN What exactly do you mean? 
CARNES The message you left. 
Carnes is distracted, waving at people.

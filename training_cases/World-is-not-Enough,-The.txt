(BOND 19) 
GUN BARREL LOGO OPENS ON 
GENEVA SWITZERLAND, an unnaturally clean city that melds old Europe with new money of both dubious and legitimate source. 
INT. HALLWAY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY 
An engraved brass plaque announcing the name of the "private banking institute" within. 
INT. PENTHOUSE BANK OFFICE - GENEVA - DAY 
JAMES BOND, dressed impeccably as ever, is being FRISKED by three THUGS in Armani suits.  They remove A GUN from inside his jacket, a well-concealed knife, a metal case, laying them on the desk that separates Bond and... 
LACHAISE...an extremely well-groomed gentleman. Behind him, three floor-to-ceiling windows lead out to a rooftop garden. 
LACHAISE Not the usual Swiss procedure, Mr. Bond, but you understand, a man in my position.. 
BOND Which is neutral, no doubt. 
Lachaise takes the joke a little tight-lipped.  Gestures for Bond to sit. 
A GIRL ENTERS, a gorgeous Swiss bombshell in a pin-striped suit.  She pushes a cart. On it are a BRIEFCASE and a box of EXPENSIVE CIGARS, which she offers to Lachaise and Bond. 
LACHAISE It wasn't easy, but I retrieved the money.  No doubt Sir Robert will be pleased to see it again. 
The efficient Cigar Girl brings the briefcase to Bond, setting it in his lap and opening it up...inside is a good deal of CASH in pound sterling. 
LACHAISE In the current exchange rate, minus the fees, of course, and certain unforeseeable expenses. Here is the receipt... 
The CIGAR GIRL offers Bond a RECEIPT... 
CIGAR GIRL Would you like to check my figures? 
BOND Perhaps later. 
She steps back. Bond reaches for the metal case on the desk...the THUGS TENSE... 
BOND My glasses. 
Lachaise nods.  Bond can have his glasses. 
He puts them on, gives a cursory look at the receipt...an odd number in pound sterling, calculated down to the penny: 
LACHAISE It's all there. 
Bond folds the receipt, slips it into his WALLET...then, he removes the glasses, slowly, deliberately, eyeing Lachaise. 
BOND I didn't come for the money. The report you sold him was stolen from an MI-6 agent, who was killed for it. 
He takes a photo from his jacket and lays it on the desk. 
LACHAISE I did not get the report from an MI-6 agent. 
BOND Who did you get it from? 
LACHAISE I am just a middle man. I am doing the honourable thing and returning the money to its rightful owner... 
BOND And we know how difficult that can be for the Swiss. 
LACHAISE (controlled fury) Your last chance. Take the money. 
BOND Your last chance. Give me the name. 
LACHAISE Stripped of all your weaponry, you still threaten me? 
He nods.  An Armani thug steps up and takes out a gun... 
BOND Perhaps you failed to take into account my...hidden assets. 
Bond's mouth edges into a smile.  A flicker of doubt on Lachaise's face -- as Bond's finger finds a protrusion on the tiny arm of his glasses and... 
KABOOM!  The pistol on the table FLASHES...blinding those around, they cover their eyes, stagger back...it is a brief effect, just enough to disorient the thugs and give Bond his opening... 
He KARATE-CHOPS HENCHMAN #1 unconscious, taking his gun. Kicks HENCHMEN #2 in the face and throws #3 OUT THE WINDOW just as they're getting their bearings.  Now he nestles the barrel of his borrowed hand gun into the hollow of Lachaise's cheek. 
BOND The name? 
LACHAISE I can't tell you... (Bond cocks the gun) Alright, alright! But you must protect me! 
And he freezes.  The handle of a THROWING KNIFE is sticking out of his neck.  Bond looks up, catches sight of the CIGAR GIRL as she vaults out the broken window and onto THE ROOF. 
Bond rushes to the window... 
EXT. VERANDAH - ROOFS - GENEVA - DAY 
She swings on a WIRE across to another roof, quickly disappearing into shadows. 
Bond can hear sirens approaching. He returns to... 
THE OFFICE...he grabs the money and moves fast for the door, casually slipping that cigar into his pocket... 
Except Henchman #1 has recovered, blocks his way, gun in hand.  He starts to squeeze the trigger -- when a RED DOT appears on his chest...another window SHATTERS as a bullet zings through and pierces the henchman in the heart. 
Bond looks back once at the shattered window, then heads out. 
INT. BANK - GENEVA - DAY 
Bond appears on the top floor of the grand old building, by the elevator.  Looks over the balcony, sees figures on the stairs.  Hears the elevator cage start from below. 
BOND FALLS, heading straight toward... 
THE MILLENNIUM DOME, which the balloon has drifted over. 
AS HE PLUMMETS DOWNWARD...Bond, never surrendering, still FIRES HIS WEAPON up at the balloon. A bullet hits the gas tank... 
EXT. BALLOON - DAY 
The BALLOON EXPLODES IN A MASSIVE FIREBALL taking the Cigar Girl with it... 
EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME - DAY 
Bond lands with a spectacular thudding bounce, the roof of the Millennium Dome breaking his fall. 
EXT. MILLENNIUM DOME ROOF - DAY 
He slides uncontrollably down the slope of the Dome as scraps of burning balloon rain down all around, before he FALLS OFF THE EDGE of the Dome and lands with a THUD ON... 
THE GROUND BELOW 
He struggles up, wincing in SEARING PAIN as his hand goes to his INJURED SHOULDER. He hold it, and looks up, into the sky as we zero in on the iris of... 
HIS EYE 
reflecting the massive smoke cloud from the explosion as the screen transforms into... 
THE MAIN TITLES 
CUT TO: 
EXT. COUNTRY ESTATE, LOCH LOMOND - DAY 
BAGPIPES.  A chapel atop a green slope overlooking the waters of Loch Lomond. 
A long line of mourners files out at the end of a memorial service.  They mill about on the lawn, among them,  M, grim- faced, BILL TANNER, CHIEF OF STAFF and JAMES BOND, his arm in a black sling. 
Bond, ever vigilant, scans the crowd... 
HIS P.O.V.  It's like a state funeral.  Rich and powerful people, government ministers, chief executives from around the world...and then... 
FAR OFF, on a DISTANT RISE, he sees a BIG MAN, not one of the mourners but an isolated observer, standing alone, wearing sunglasses and a military haircut. 
The man seems to see Bond looking at him... 
M Bond, we'll meet you inside. 
Bond looks at her for a brief second...when he turns back, the man is gone, like an APPARITION. 
Bond walks off, up the grassy slope, toward the rise. 
CUT TO: 
THE VIEW ACROSS THE VALLEY 
Bond stands on the hill, looking below.  He sees nothing but a green carpet, not a tree to hide behind. 
He hears a crunch of leaves...turns... 
HIS P.O.V.  A WOMAN, in mourning black, coming up the hill. Her china doll face is both fragile and proud. 
WOMAN Beautiful, isn't it? 
BOND Yes. 
She steps up to the ridge with him.  A breeze blows her hair. They stare out. The sun's rays have broken the clouds and strafe the valley. 
WOMAN Today, of all days, the sun decides to shine. 
BOND Perhaps Sir Robert had a word with the Man Upstairs. 
WOMAN A word? I'm sure by now he's engineered a hostile takeover. 
BOND You knew him well? 
The sun glints off her bejewelled earlobe. 
WOMAN He was my father. 
BOND I'm sorry. 
WOMAN He died before he could complete his lifelong dream. (beat) I intend to finish it for him. 
A voice interrupts them, calling from the estate... 
OLDER MAN Elektra! 
ELEKTRA Excuse me. 
She walks away, the wind pressing her dress against her delicate figure.  She looks brave and vulnerable as she walks back toward her father's grand house. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIMOUSINE - TRAVELING - DAY 
M, Bond and Tanner in the rear of a limousine. The vehicle swoops through the epic countryside of the Scottish Highlands. 
M Elektra?  Running King Industries? (she broods) I've known that girl all her life. I'm not sure she knows what she's walking into. 
BOND She's not a girl anymore. 
M looks at Bond. Eyes his sling. 
Tanner notices a RED LIGHT start pulsing.  He moves to M: 
TANNER Your call to the PM. 
M nods grimly.  As Robinson distributes sealed envelopes: 
M Our credibility has been hit hard.  We have to hit back harder. Your assignments. 
They open their envelopes, but Bond received nothing. 
M (to Bond) I'm waiting for the report on your medical. 
She leaves.  Bond is brooding. 
CUT TO: 
INT. RESEARCH ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - NIGHT 
An ancient nook chock full of hi-tech equipment.  Bond concentrates on a screen displaying PHOTOGRAPHS, NEWSPAPER AND TELEVISION CLIPS -- all to do with King's life and times. 
Bond touches the screen on a photo of...ELEKTRA. 
INT. SCREEN 
One story dominates -- the KIDNAPPING OF ELEKTRA KING. A Polaroid of Elektra savagely beaten, ear bandaged, holding a newspaper: beneath the photo is scrawled "$5,000,000." 
NEWSCASTER ...somehow managed to shoot two of her captors and escape... 
POLICE VIDEO: Elektra interviewed; bruised, emotional. 
VOICE ... the leader, the one who escaped.  Can you describe him? 
ELEKTRA He shouted.  He shouted all the time -- 
Bond touches Elektra's face, freezing her tears. 
His eyes wander to the photo with the ransom demand: $5,000,000.  A thought forms.  He takes out his wallet, opening it and removing: 
THE RECEIPT FROM LACHAISE. 
E.C.U. The strange figure, in pounds: 3,030,303.03. 
Bond taps some keys. The words EXCHANGE RATE appear on the screen...pounds to dollars. 
He enters '3,030,303.03 POUNDS STERLING' and through multiplication by the exchange rate this becomes: 
'5,000,000 US DOLLARS.'  He stares at it. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - DUSK 
Bond paces the flagstones, FOOTSTEPS ECHOING. 
INT. BRIEFING ROOM - CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ) - CONTINUOUS 
Bond opens the door on M who stands alone by the window, looking out at the long shadows on the moors. 
BOND Tell me about the kidnapping of Elektra King. 
She turns, her brow furrowing. 
M Who told you to look at Elektra's files? 
BOND I took the initiative. 
M You haven't been given an assignment in this case. 
BOND I was the one who brought that money in... 
M I'm well aware of your stake in this, If you have a point, get to it. 
BOND The amount of money that killed Robert King is the same amount as the ransom demand for Elektra. 
He hands her a slip of paper. 
BOND Whoever kidnapped Elektra is the same man who killed her father. 
M looks at the paper, a long time. 
M It's a message.  He wants us to know he's back. 
BOND Who? 
M Claude Serrault.  A.K.A... 
BOND (this is serious) Renard. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BRIEFING ROOM, CASTLE THANE (MI-6 HQ)- NIGHT 
A HUGE, TRANSPARENT 3-D IMAGE OF RENARD'S SKULL floats in the centre of the room.  Other images of him on wall screens. 
M Sir Robert tried to deal with the kidnapping with his own...resources, at first. When Elektra's ear was delivered to him in the post, he came to me. (measured) I advised against paying the ransom. I knew it was Renard. I played it out as long as possible to get a fix on him. 
BOND Sacrifice the girl to take out the terrorist? 
M How many deaths is he responsible for? How many innocent people? You may only get one shot at a man like Renard. Same circumstances, I'd do the same again. 
She turns to the hologram. 
The jet lands on a runway of the metal sheets Bond saw being laid as he passed... 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE, NEAR CAUCASUS MOUNTAINS - DAY 
Davidov pulls out Bond's gun. 
BOND (re:  gun) I'd rather you didn't play with that. 
Davidov ignores him, looking the gun over. 
DAVIDOV Nice. 
BOND Quite stunning. 
Bond turns to watch a LIFTING HELICOPTER swoop in and drop down an air-conditioned office.  Military precision. 
Davidov's radio crackles out a message and he tosses the gun back to Bond.  They start walking: 
DAVIDOV (pleasant) Sorry about all that, comrade. Old habits die hard. I am Head of Security. Davidov. 
Bond eyes him, but is distracted by a jet coming to a halt ahead of them. 
Stairs swing down and out steps ELEKTRA KING.  Beautiful, elegant.  So out of place in this world of men.  She surveys the worksite. 
Impressed, Bond takes his ID back from Davidov. 
INT. OFFICE, CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS 
Bond and Davidov step into a fully functioning office. Everything Elektra requires is here. Computer, phones, drinks cabinet. She is in the middle of a group of workmen and secretaries, looking at plans, talking, pouring herself a cup of coffee. 
ELEKTRA (to Foreman) ...they should have been in place two days ago. That is the target my father set. 
FOREMAN We've had some trouble with the villagers at Ruan. Some sacred burial plot... 
DAVIDOV Miss King...James Bond here to see you. 
She looks up...a brief moment of RECOGNITION...then back to business. 
ELEKTRA Find me the research on the limestone deposits, go ahead and place these orders, and get the jeep ready. I will go to Ruan myself... 
DAVIDOV Miss King, I wouldn't recommend... 
ELEKTRA I said, I will go. 
She signs some documents and the men file out. She gets up, turning her back to Bond, hands on her hips. 
ELEKTRA Would you excuse us, Davidov? 
Davidov nods and leaves. Elektra still keeps her back turned, but he can see her physically change, her shoulders sag, her arms cross in front of her. When she finds her voice, it has a gravelly sound of emotion. 
ELEKTRA I met you at my father's funeral. 
BOND Yes. 
ELEKTRA I haven't been able to recall a single moment of that day...until now. 
BOND Funerals aren't exactly memorable. 
ELEKTRA God no. All those horrible loved ones and relatives. I don't want to talk to those people. I just want to...talk to my father. (beat) I loved him.  I'm not sure he knew that. 
BOND Is that why you want to finish the pipeline? 
ELEKTRA Partially, yes. 
Her muscleman BODY GUARD appears, says briefly: 
GABOR The jeep is ready, Ma'am.  Will I be driving with you? 
ELEKTRA No, Gabor. We have a guest. 
Gabor glares at Bond before he leaves. 
BOND Who is he? 
ELEKTRA My bodyguard. He follows me everywhere. He's decisive, vigilant.  And he makes an excellent omelette. 
BOND How long has he been with you? 
ELEKTRA Since the kidnapping. Why do you ask? 
Bond takes something out of his pocket, he opens his palm, shows it to her. 
BOND Does this look familiar to you? 
ELEKTRA It's my father's pin. He wore it everyday of his life. 
She swallows back emotion. Looks in his eyes, with a sad half- smile that unsettles him. 
ELEKTRA Are you trying to break my heart? Or is it just your way with women? 
BOND It's not the pin your father wore. It's an exact duplicate. Inside is a tiny electrical detonator. We have reason to believe the assassin had an inside accomplice, someone who worked at this company. 
ELEKTRA If you've come here to look after me, Mr. Bond, thank you, but no thank you.  I have two bodyguards, I don't need a third... 
She starts to walk out.  He follows her... 
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS 
BOND The killer doesn't want to see this pipeline continue, doesn't want to see you take over... 
ELEKTRA That's every man within a five mile radius.  Including you. (off his look) That's why you're here, isn't it? You think I can't do it. You think I'm going to screw up. Or get myself killed. 
Bond and Elektra stand on the mountainside, feeling like the only two people in the world, when they hear: THE DISTANT HUM OF A PLANE. 
EXT. SKY - DAY 
They see FOUR OBJECTS falling out the back of the aircraft. As the objects plummet silently toward the earth, they POP PARACHUTES, their fall slows and then, as Bond and Elektra watch in disbelief... 
GUNFIRE echoes out from the black shapes, now visible as PARASKIS, low-flying, sleek, deadly snow vehicles. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY 
Bond turns to Elektra, he has to yell over the sound of the approaching machines. 
BOND Head for that gully, I'll lure them into the trees! 
He points her off to one side, where a shallow gully offers cover...she skis off to shelter and he skis OUT...INTO THE OPEN...where the paraskis trail after him... 
He streaks toward the trees as the vehicles gain on him, firing... 
EXT. FOREST 
He makes it to the woods, finding cover in the trees, whipping in and out of sight as PARASKI #1 tries to follow, sinking lower and lower until... 
HIS SKIDS catch on some over hanging branches...the Paraski is CATAPULTED into a tree and EXPLODES... 
EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS 
Coming in to pick up the pursuit of Bond is Paraski #2, firing down at Bond, dropping bombs which explode just behind him in the snow.  The other two paraskis LAND and eject their chutes, now RACING THROUGH THE WOODS on the ground. 
Bond looks behind him, sees them gaining...he zigzags through the trees and suckers Paraski #3 to glance off one tree, hit another and wipe out behind. 
But the remaining predator on the ground, Paraski #4, is gaining on him...Bond bursts out of the trees and finds himself heading toward... 
THE EDGE OF A PRECIPICE... 
He cranks himself right, narrowly avoiding a tumble over the edge.  Paraski #4 isn't so lucky and SAILS OFF THE CLIFF to a hundred and fifty foot drop. 
BOND (smiling) Should have stuck to snowboarding. 
But the smile is wiped off his face as...AN EMERGENCY PARACHUTE deploys from the back... 
The Paraski does a climbing turn and heads straight back for him... 
Bond skis for his life, away from Paraski #4 when PARASKI #2 appears in front of him...guns blazing... 
One ahead and one behind, Bond turns back...he has nowhere to go but... 
OVER THE EDGE 
He sails through the air and lands on the Paraski #4, slashing the parachute with his ski pole before bouncing off and doing an amazing tumbling hundred foot fall to the snow, where he lands on his skis... Paraski four, the chute tangling in the rotors of its propeller, struggles to maintain control, his vehicle inexorably hurtling toward PARASKI #2: both of them having set their course for Bond, they are now on a collision course with EACH OTHER... 
IN THE GULLY BELOW 
Bond meets up with Elektra as above them... 
The two Paraskis collide, crashing into the snowy hill above and tumbling down, end over end. 
Bond and Elektra huddle together as shards and debris rain down on them. 
Then...silence.  An eerie silence. 
ELEKTRA Are they gone? All of them? 
Bond nods, ripping from his pole a PIECE OF THE PARACHUTE he slashed and wiping his face with it...he looks at the piece of fabric in his hand.  He sees: 
CYRILLIC LETTERS...undecipherable to us...but there is a look on his face, a look of recognition as... 
AN EARTH RATTLING RUMBLE grows above them. 
Bond stuffs the parachute fragment in his ski-suit as he turns... 
The exploding Paraskis have triggered AN AVALANCHE on the slope above. 
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/AVALANCHE AREA - DAY 
They try to outrun it -- riding the sliding hill -- but they haven't a hope... the rest of the snow is catching them, they're going to get swallowed. 
EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE/AVALANCHE AREA - DAY 
The ground shudders, the THUNDER CLOSING...  Their ankles are soon covered, Elektra falls.  Bond stops, pulls her up. They're about to die.  He pulls her to him. 
BOND Hold on to me. 
She's confused and frightened but does as she's told. 
They hold one another tight as -- here it comes -- the white fury hurtles over them, burying them...  At the last moment, just as their heads vanish from view... 
CLOSE ON BOND PULLING THE Q GADGET ON THE JACKET. 
The AIRBAG slams open.  The snow covers it and them.  More and more snow slides over... 
CUT TO: 
INT. SNOW HOLE - MOMENTS LATER 
Darkness.  The RUMBLING CEASES... 
Light emanates from Bond's watch.  In the shadows he pulls a knife, punctures the air bag. It deflates, leaving them cocooned in an icy tomb.  Elektra looks around, staring, unbelieving. 
ELEKTRA Oh my God...we're buried alive... 
BOND We're alright. 
BOND I have to go. 
ELEKTRA Then take me with you. 
BOND No. You'll be safe here. 
ELEKTRA I don't want to be safe! 
BOND I have to go to work. 
He starts toward the door. 
ELEKTRA Now who's the coward? 
He stops, his back up...then heads out the door. 
IN THE HALLWAY 
He passes Gabor, standing faithfully outside. 
CUT TO: 
EST. SHOT - EXT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT 
Elegant, mysterious.  A modern day Casablanca. 
INT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT 
Bond in evening dress in the sumptuous casino. He takes out the Q glasses, slips them on, surveys the room -- 
HIS X-RAY POV 
He can see all the WEAPONS carried by the players.  All sizes of pistol, even the odd grenade.  The obvious side-effect of this view -- he can see through clothes. 
His eyes alight on two girls walking away from him.  One of them turns to look back, unaware that she is on display.  She returns Bond's smile.  Her friend turns to look.  Bond's smile grows:  she has a small pistol concealed over one breast. 
INT. CASINO NOIR D'OR, BAKU - NIGHT 
He looks over the lenses -- and spies someone on the fringes. His old adversary, ex-KGB, VALENTIN ZUKOVSKY, talking to some suspicious types. Zukovsky looks across. Bond walks toward him. 
BOND Valentin Zukovsky. 
ZUKOVSKY BondJamesBond. What brings you here? 
BOND You, of course. I need some information. 
ZUKOVSKY Bond, I'm a civilian. This is my place. Used to be the royal family's, now it's mine. I run my little business, I stay out of trouble... 
BOND (looking about) Mafia warlords, Diplomats and spies, consortiums from every country in the world.  A nice little rat's nest. 
ZUKOVSKY (offering hors d'ouevres) Have some of the rat's nest caviar.  From my own fishery.  They buy my caviar, drink my champagne, lose to my House. 
He turns to a suspicious-looking Heavy. 
ZUKOVSKY Let me introduce you to a former colleague of mine at the KGB. Dmitri Palov, you may know him as...the Boa. 
The Boa is completely bald, muscular; huge, deadly hands. 
BOA The great 007. For years I have dreamed of closing my hands around your neck. 
BOND Boa. Have you had any therapy since Perestroika? 
ZUKOVSKY Why am I suddenly worried I'm not carrying enough insurance? 
The Boa leaves, glaring all the while. 
ZUKOVSKY See?  You're upsetting my customers. What do you want? 
BOND How does a terrorist like Renard supply his men with state-of-the-art Russian Army weapons? 
ZUKOVSKY What?  This is not possible. 
Bond takes from his pocket the fragment of the PARACHUTE. Zukovsky examines the letters. 
BOND If I remember my Cyrillic that says 101st airborne division. 
ZUKOVSKY Where did you get this? 
BOND Off a high-powered Paraski that was trying to kill me. 
Zukovsky shakes his head. Sighs. 
ZUKOVSKY The Russian Army, they spend millions on flying skis, but they cannot afford to pay the soldiers. The men, they do what they have to do to feed their families. In this country, for the right price and a pack of cigarettes, you can get anything you want. 
He notices Bond watching THE HOSTESS BAR...a dark alcove of the casino, where slinky HOOKERS flatter the guests. 
ZUKOVSKY That too. Everyone does what they can to survive. 
BOND How high up does this...arms dealing go? 
ZUKOVSKY Bond. If someone wants you dead, it is Renard. Our government has nothing to gain by killing you. 
BOND But you would have something to gain by killing Robert King. And stopping his pipeline. 
This hits Zukovsky. He closes down. A chill between them. 
ZUKOVSKY Poor Bond. The cold war is over.  What have you got left? Economic espionage. Murder in the boardroom.  So dull. 
Bond's eyes catch something, someone entering the casino. 
HIS POV:  ELEKTRA...more vibrant than we have ever seen her, living up to her name. She is impossibly glamorous in a sparkling dress that fits like second skin.  Her hair is full and tumbling, her eyes are fiery and wild. 
DAVIDOV (croaks out) Bond... 
RENARD Should be dead as well. Your failure today is astonishing.  It is a disgrace. 
He approaches close to him, stopping at the flaming SCONCE near his head. 
RENARD Do you know why the color is blue at the wick? 
Davidov starts to sweat. 
RENARD Because that is where the flame is the hottest. 
Renard touches the glass well of oil. 
RENARD The temperature is close to five hundred degrees. 
Renard uses his knife and POPS the seal from the lamp, removing the well of oil...a DROP of the hot oil FALLS ON HIS HAND and SINGES IT BLACK in an instant... 
Renard does not even flinch.  Davidov starts talking, trying to placate... 
DAVIDOV The plane...it's all been arranged... 
RENARD Then you are completely unnecessary... 
Renard raises the container of oil over Davidov's head: 
DAVIDOV I have the documents, the landing authorizations, the security passes... 
Renard stops, the oil tilted, just ready to pour... 
His dead eye...has it drooped further since we last saw him?...seems to glitter in the light... 
RENARD Bond is suspicious. We are moving sooner, tonight.  We understand each other? 
DAVIDOV Yes...yes... 
Renard lets a TRICKLE OF OIL drop onto Davidov's head... 
HE SCREAMS as his hair smokes and singes... 
Renard makes a motion, the THUG releases Davidov, who falls to the floor, clutching his head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CASINO - THE BLACK JACK TABLE 
Another deal. ZUKOVSKY and others watch, as Elektra stakes even more.  People move closer for a view.  The Dealer shows a five. Elektra shows Bond her cards. 
Elektra is holding two eights. Dealer's up-card is a six. 
BOND Stand or split them. 
She smiles. He holds her gaze. 
ELEKTRA Surely you believe in living dangerously. 
BOND Not at that price. Time to surrender. 
They eye one another a long while -- sex firmly in the air. She smiles.  She moves ALL HER CHIPS forward. 
Bond catches a look between the Dealer and Zukovsky: 
DEALER The House has no limit. 
General kerfuffle.  Bond looks back toward THE HOSTESS BAR...no sign of Davidov's return... 
ELEKTRA (to Dealer) Hit me. 
The Dealer scoops a card from the shoe.  Tension.  Everyone holds their breath...as he turns over...  -- a six.  Bust. The audience inhale as one AS THE DEALER TAKES ALL HER CHIPS AWAY. 
Elektra stands.  She has dignity in defeat. She turns to Bond, holding out a hand. 
ELEKTRA Time to surrender. 
EXT. CASINO - NIGHT 
Bond, Elektra, Gabor outside, Davidov soon joining them, trying to look like he hasn't been through hell.  Bond notices the burn on his head. Davidov touches it self- consciously. 
DAVIDOV A little accident. 
BOND A night of burning passion? 
Davidov scowls at him. Bond leads Elektra away... 
CUT TO: 
A DISTANT P.O.V. FROM HIGH ABOVE. 
Someone watches Bond and Elektra move toward his BMW. 
HENCHMAN (V.O.) What about Bond? 
EXT. CASINO ROOF 
RENARD and his henchmen, watching. Renard seems mesmerized by the sight of Bond's HAND on the small of Elektra's back, their easy sensuality as they both get into the car. 
HENCHMAN Sir?  Sir? 
RENARD (seething) I will take care of Mister Bond. 
CUT TO: 
Bond flicks a switch.  A NEEDLE-THIN BEAM is directed from the BMW to the window of the office.  He can HEAR a synthesis of Davidov's voice... 
DAVIDOV (V.O.) I'm running late...no, no, I'll make it...how will they know I'm your man?...romashka...romashka...alright. 
Bond hears the click of a phone hanging up.  He flicks another switch in his car, an infra-red tracking system activates in his WINDSCREEN... 
He can now see Davidov perfectly as he comes out of the security quarters, carrying a briefcase and a large DUFFLE BAG which he carries to the car and loads into the TRUNK. 
He goes back inside. 
BOND gets out of the BMW.  He moves stealthily to the Russian vehicle and, using the laser beam on his watch, opens the lock on the trunk.  It pops open. 
Bond sees the briefcase, and the dufflebag, and...SOMETHING ELSE...something beneath them...he moves the objects aside: 
A MAN is folded into the back of the trunk, his head slumped forward, dark hair on the back of his head slightly wet ...blood? Bond tips the head back, revealing GLASSY DEAD EYES. 
Bond leans in and plucks a BADGE from his white shirt pocket. 
It has a photo of the dead man and reads, in English and Cyrillic: LEONID TASHKA - FIELD INSPECTOR.  On the corner of the badge...THE RUSSIAN SEAL...Miratom. The one from the report.  Bond touches it with his thumb, recognizing it. 
AT THE OFFICE 
Davidov is coming out... 
Bond LOWERS THE TRUNK DOOR and crouches behind the car. 
AT THE OFFICE ENTRANCE 
Davidov pauses to lock the door. He walks toward the Russian car...he is actually WHISTLING a happy tune and then... 
HE STOPS. He has heard something. He draws his gun. He walks AROUND the entire car.  When he gets to the rear... 
THE TRUNK IS CLOSED.  Bond is not there.  No evidence he ever was. 
Davidov gets in the driver's seat and starts the car. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. AIR STRIP - NIGHT 
The Russian car drives onto the grounds of a small, deserted AIRPORT consisting of one outbuilding and a crudely cleared airstrip. 
INT. CAR 
Davidov pulls off the road and parks his car in a wooded area. 
EXT. CAR 
Davidov's feet crunch in the dirt as he walks to the back and opens the trunk. 
He removes the briefcase.  Then the duffle bag.  He looks down at the dead body,  head slumped forward, as before...but something is different, the clothes not quite right and then: 
THE DEAD BODY MOVES, the head turns, Davidov gasps... 
It IS JAMES BOND. 
BOND Problem, comrade? 
Davidov pulls his HAND GUN from inside his coat, but Bond is quicker.  With a silenced pistol he shoots Davidov in the head. One little red hole forms in his forehead as his eyes go wide and he crumbles, dead. 
Bond climbs out of the trunk.  Crouches to examine Davidov. 
BOND Old habits die hard. 
He straightens.  Picks up the briefcase.  It is locked.  He searches Davidov and finds a set of keys in his pocket.  He opens the lock. 
INSIDE THE BRIEFCASE:  FOUR STACKS OF MONEY.  Documents headed with the official crest of Miratom.  A new security tag, it looks just like the dead guy's, but has Davidov's name and picture...some hologrammed (blank) security tags -- and a polaroid-type camera. 
He picks up a blank security tag and inserts it in the camera.  Points at himself, takes a shot.  Punches in 'Davidov' on the KEYPAD.  Out comes a brand new pass. 
Bond goes to look in the dufflebag but... 
A PLANE is approaching...HE LOOKS UP. 
HIS P.O.V.  A Russian military jet appears over the trees, flying low, its red landing lights blinking. 
EXT. AIRSTRIP - NIGHT 
A door opens on the sinister-looking plane.  A hydraulic step unit folds out of it.  A BIG SOLDIER with a machine gun waits in the doorway. 
BOND, standing at the edge of the runway, clips on his badge and picks up the briefcase.  He has NO IDEA what he's walking into. 
BOND Here goes nothing. 
He hoists the dufflebag over his shoulder and walks out to the plane.  He starts up the steps: 
THE SOLDIER POINTS HIS GUN DOWN AT HIM. Says something to him IN RUSSIAN. 
Bond pauses.  And then, thinking, says: 
BOND Romashka. 
The soldier looks at him, then lowers his weapon. 
INT. PLANE 
Four soldiers. The first guy and a moustachioed PILOT and two young men, a nasty-looking private, cadaverously thin, and a big, thick-necked tough. 
They all look at Bond, expectantly, waiting for him to say or do...what? He decides to take the lead. He opens the briefcase and hands over the STACKS OF MONEY. 
The Pilot passes it out. But that isn't the end. They still stare at him.  The Pilot says something IN RUSSIAN that sounds like..."where's the rest?" 
INT. TEST CHAMBER MAIN ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER 
Bond descends, going down deep. 
INT. TEST CHAMBER ELEVATOR/CORRIDOR - LATER 
The elevator creaks to a halt.  He slides the elevator doors OPEN revealing... 
TWO SOLDIERS waiting for the elevator. Bond shows them his ID. 
SOLDIER (subtitles) See the corporal, at the end of the chamber. 
The soldiers get into the elevator and disappear, leaving Bond completely ALONE. 
Dead silence in the shadows.  Bond's in his element, that alert glint in his eye as he takes in his surroundings. 
HIS P.O.V.  A long, dark corridor...leading off to a more open circle in the distance, lights and an ominous humming there. 
Bond starts down the passageway. 
INT. TEST CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 
Ahead of Bond, like a deadly spider at the centre of a web, a NUCLEAR BOMB suspended over a pit. 
Blast openings range around to channel its fury to measuring equipment. 
Bond is alone with the bomb. An eerie moment. Then, he comes to notice a figure, across the expanse of the pit, on the opposite side of the catwalk, a man, with his back to him, in Russian Army fatigues. 
BOND Corporal? 
The man turns... 
IT IS RENARD. 
He smiles. 
RENARD I see my friend Davidov ran into some difficulty. 
BOND Indeed. 
Renard starts toward him.  Bond draws his gun. 
BOND Don't come any closer. 
MAN You can't kill me. I'm already dead. 
He and Bond face off, the malevolent bomb between them, a ROBOT DEVICE beginning to lower it into the pit. 
RENARD Go ahead.  Shoot.  My men will still steal the bomb, and the shot will bring them directly to you. 
Renard gestures into the pit. 
BOND'S P.O.V.  TWO OF RENARD'S MEN in the pit, unaware of what is happening above, working directly with the bomb. One of them is using a manual...IT IS JUST LIKE THE STOLEN REPORT, the Miratom seal in the corner. 
Bond aims his gun at Renard's head. 
BOND Who's paying you to destroy the pipeline? 
Renard resumes walking, around the catwalk at the edge of the pit, toward Bond, slowly, surely, totally fearless. 
RENARD To die by a man who can't even grasp what he's caught up in... 
Bond, out of the corner of his eye, sees Renard's man remove a SMALL DEVICE from inside the bomb.  It is the size and shape of a credit card, black, with shiny transistors on it...the man slips it into his pocket. 
BOND Revenge isn't so hard to fathom. What's clever is getting someone else to pay for it. 
RENARD Not many people in this world have that kind of fortune. 
Bond cocks the pistol. 
BOND Who is it? 
RENARD You think I fear death? I welcome it. I get on my knees and pray for it. You, on the other hand, you have something to live for, no? (closer now) She's beautiful isn't she? You should have seen her before. Flawless, and still so innocent, not such a whore in bed... 
Bond's eyes flare in fury.  He shoves Renard into the wall and presses the gun to his temple. 
BOND You will never touch her. You will never get near her. 
RENARD Have you forgotten who saved your life in Geneva? 
BOND Consider me ungrateful. 
RENARD It's I who should thank you -- for taking that money back to MI-6.  So distressing for M.  An explosion inside her lair. 
BOND She'll get over it. 
RENARD You even brought the plane for us.  We really couldn't have done it without you. 
Bond strikes him across the temple with his pistol.  Renard drops to his knees.  He touches his temple, looks at the blood curiously, feeling no pain. 
RENARD A man tires of being executed. 
As Bond screws a silencer onto the muzzle of his gun: 
RENARD But then again...There is no point in living if you can't...feel alive. 
Bond knows that, he's heard it somewhere before...IT FREEZES HIM, just a beat, but it is enough... 
SUDDENLY, the noise of footsteps -- CHRISTMAS JONES, with COLONEL AKAKIEVICH and two armed soldiers. 
We're with them as they turn the corner of the passageway and see Bond with silenced pistol aimed at the kneeling Renard -- classic execution stance: 
Renard is loading the bomb it into the ELEVATOR. He flicks a switch on the panel by the elevator.  The IRIS starts closing on Bond... 
INT. PASSAGEWAY 
Bond rushes for the door -- but he's shocked as the man he shot lunges.  Clings to him. 
Bond hits him away, he LEAPS for the cart blocking his way and SHOVES IT INTO THE IRIS DOOR just as it almost closes... 
Bond squeezes through... 
INT. OTHER SIDE OF IRIS 
Renard is getting in the ELEVATOR.  Sees Bond made it, fires. Bond rolls into a corner. 
RENARD We have our fireworks.  Now you can have yours. 
And he machine-guns some barrels.  Rocket fuel spills out. He digs a finger into one of the holes, effortlessly rips the metal so more fuel cascades out. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CATWALK ABOVE PIT 
Christmas cuts some wires together and with a hum, her IRIS DOOR OPENS... 
AT THE ELEVATOR 
Bond fires at Renard, hitting his shin... 
WITH RENARD 
looking down at his shin, noticing the blood.  Inconvenienced but not in pain.  He shuts the cage doors.  Pauses only to fire off half a clip at the SWITCH PANEL.  Shreds it. 
Bond leaps to his feet, racing forward, firing -- gets to the elevator as Renard disappears upwards with a smile. He POINTS DOWN...underneath him... 
Bond looks down. 
HIS P.O.V.  BENEATH THE ELEVATOR...A makeshift explosive device...sticks of dynamite wrapped around a detonator, set to explode 
Eyes wide, Bond looks back to the doors -- then to the switch panel -- now just a chaos of sparking wires. 
INT. LIFT SHAFT 
The pipe bomb ticking... 
INT. PASSAGEWAY BY ELEVATOR 
Bond is trapped.  He looks up... 
THE PULLEY HOOK HANGS DOWN... 
He jumps up, grabbing it, just as... 
KABOOM! 
The bomb ignites the spilled oil, A FIREBALL shoots along, scorching after Bond, who is SAILING THROUGH THE PASSAGE WAY, the force of the blast sending him hurling down the passageway ON THE PULLEY...heading straight for: 
A CLOSED IRIS DOOR which miraculously begins to OPEN as he SHOOTS THROUGH... 
Ahead, the next door is OPEN as well. He sees CHRISTMAS on the other side... 
HER P.O.V.  Bond hurtling toward her, ahead of a MASSIVE FIREBALL... 
BOND Close the door!  Close the door! 
But before she can, two of the FUEL BARRELS HURTLE through the closing iris, clattering into the pit, starting a fire below. 
Flames licking up the sides of the pit toward them. 
Bond looks up, sees the ARM OF THE ROBOT LIFTER, stretching upward toward an old SHAFT t the top of the ceiling... 
He and Christmas scramble up the robot arm, walk along the spider-like web that supported the bomb and find... 
AN OLD ELEVATOR...powered by a hydraulic system... 
They get in...hear the rumbling of the fire below...the old elevator moves slowly...the rumbling grows louder... 
BOND Shame you had to spot I wasn't the real thing. 
CHRISTMAS So who are you? 
BOND Bond -- 
Bond FIRES HIS GUN at the hissing hydraulic pulleys and... 
THE ELEVATOR shoots through the shaft at breakneck speed as 
BELOW THEM...THE PIT EXPLODES... 
INT. ELEVATOR 
Fire shoots up. Bond lunges to cover Christmas. As the smoke clears: 
BOND (finishing) James Bond. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MESA - TEST FACILITY - KAZAKHSTAN - CONTINUOUS 
Christmas and Bond climb out of the duct.  Through a cloud of dust he can see people running about, panicked.  There's been some shooting -- fresh corpses litter the ground. 
Bond looks past them to a plane coming this way.  The plane. It roars past, level with them.  He follows it with his eyes, helpless as it gets smaller and smaller... 
BOND Or did you steal it from your old friend Renard? 
ELEKTRA ...what? 
BOND We had a run-in, he and I. He knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me... 
Elektra stands...she begins to tremble. 
ELEKTRA Are you saying...Renard is the man who's trying to kill me? 
BOND You can drop the act, it's over. 
ELEKTRA I don't know what you're talking about! 
BOND I think you do. 
He walks toward her, threatening... 
BOND At MI-6 we call it Stockholm Syndrome. It's common in kidnappings.  A young impressionable victim. Sheltered, sexually inexperienced. A powerful kidnapper skilled in torture, in manipulation. Something snaps in the victim's mind. The captive falls in love with her captor. 
At the word "love," Elektra explodes.  She SLAPS an unsuspecting Bond hard across the face. 
ELEKTRA How dare you!  How dare you! That animal!?  That monster!? He disgusts me! You disgust me!  So he knew where to hurt you, is that it? You had a sling on your arm at the funeral! I didn't have to sleep with you to find that out. 
BOND He used your exact words. 
ELEKTRA You knew.  You knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. You used me, you used me as bait. You made love to me -- what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike? 
He has no answer.  He can't deny what she says. 
The phone rings, cuts through the tension.  Bond and Elektra staring at one another.  She lets it ring...  Then picks up. Listens, looks to Bond. 
ELEKTRA He's struck again. (beat) Five men are dead at the pipeline. 
He moves toward her. 
BOND I'm coming with you. 
ELEKTRA You do what you have to do, but I've called in M.  She's en route from London even now. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - DAY 
The MI-6 chopper lands.  We can see M through the window. Face set hard. 
EXT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER, TURKEY - MOMENTS LATER 
SCIENTIFIC, MILITARY and TURKISH POLICE VEHICLES parked around a medium-sized industrial plant. 
Bond accompanies M and Tanner toward a clutch of offices. All around, SOLDIERS, IDA personnel, POLICE scour the area. 
M (to Bond) Glad to see you've turned up. 
He is moving fast, talking fast -- a sense of urgency. 
BOND They hit about 90 minutes ago. There's a scientist here from the International Decommissioning Agency, Dr. Jones.  She has ten crews combing the area. 
They step out of the bright sunlight and into 
EXT.\INT. CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS 
FIVE BODY BAGS are being carried out by soldiers.  M surveys the scene; in an unlit corridor CHRISTMAS JONES and several men sweep the area with CLICKING Geiger counters. 
ELEKTRA is a distance away, listening to a Turkish policeman explain what's happening.  She nods acknowledgement to M. 
Tanner senses that Bond wants to talk to M alone: 
TANNER I'll see how they're coming with the power... 
They watch him go.  M turns to Bond: 
M You had your hand on the bomb and you let Renard get away with it. 
He draws her away, to a small alcove.  Takes something out of his jacket...THE LOCATOR CARD. 
BOND The report King bought. It's a manual. Renard's men used it to remove this radio tracking device from the warhead. 
M Then Robert was right about a Russian connection. 
BOND They're getting their weapons from the Russians, but where are they getting the money to buy the weapons?  I can't help thinking...the person close to King, the one who switched that pin... 
M The inside man? 
BOND Is maybe...the inside woman. 
NOW THE LIGHTS POWER UP, disrupt the intimacy and intensity of their exchange.  The room is lined with MONITORS and a huge SATELLITE MAP of the pipeline's meandering path. 
M A woman? 
But before he can speak, ELEKTRA calls out, gesturing to A DIM LIGHT flashing on a console in front of her. 
ELEKTRA That's not right. 
A Technician comes over.  Tanner too, followed by Bond and M. 
TANNER What is it? 
ELEKTRA It's an observation and repair rig. Travels along the pipe, checks for broken seals.  But it's not supposed to be there. 
BOND (thinks) Stop it. 
Bond and Christmas waiting expectantly.  Tense silence. 
Finally, a WHOOSHING NOISE, GETTING LOUDER.  Lights appear behind, reflecting on a bend, then... here it comes, the rig tearing through the pipe. 
Bond looks over his shoulder at Christmas' speedometer...she's only at fifty... 
BOND Faster! Get our speed up! 
Christmas presses forward...Bond turns, his feet OUT toward the approaching rig...the lights getting closer... closer... 
Bond's rig jolts as the other makes contact.  He cushions the blow with his feet.  Both rigs moving together now, he CLIMBS ONTO THE BOMB RIG...Puts out a hand, helps Christmas across. 
The bomb sits there, daunting, deadly. 
CHRISTMAS Tactical fission device.  Low yield. 
They look at one another, then set straight to work. 
INT. COMMAND ROOM - PIPELINE CONTROL CENTRE - CONTINUOUS 
The room is quiet, tense.  M and her two men, Elektra, Gabor, the King TECHNICIAN and three armed security guards at the doors. They are the only ones left.  Going down with the ship...if it goes.  M and Elektra watch the two lights now together on the console.  A tense silence.  Everyone's edgy. Elektra perhaps a little more than the rest.  She exchanges a glance with Gabor. 
INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY 
CLOSE INSIDE THE BOMB:  the timer.  1:45 MINUTES. 
Bond's face betrays the difficulty of what they're attempting.  The digital clock ticks down... 1:30, 1:29... 
OMITTED 217-218 
INT. PIPELINE - DAY 
The rigs speed through the tunnel. Nothing to see.  But WHOOSH!  As the rigs hurtle past... 
INT. ELECTRIC RIG - PIPELINE (TRAVELLING) - DAY 
The pipe suddenly dips.  They cling on as the machine bucks like a rollercoaster.  Back on a straight... 
Her brow furrows. 
CHRISTMAS The plutonium is missing.  They've taken the core! 
BOND Then it's no longer a bomb? 
CHRISTMAS (back to work, urgent) It's a bomb alright. We're still dead if the trigger charge goes off... 
Bond's mind races in the ghostly light of the tunnel. 
He stares at the timer:  0:44, 0:43...  Makes a decision. 
BOND Let it blow. 
Christmas shoots a look, astonished. 
CHRISTMAS But we can stop it. 
Taking her arm... 
BOND Let it blow. 
She can't believe what he's saying. His eyes shoot to an INSPECTION HATCH the lights illuminate up ahead. 
BOND Trust me.  Leave it. 
He grabs her, wrenches her away from the bomb. 
INT. PIPELINE - DAY 
The rig zooms past the exit hatch -- Bond leaps off, taking her with him.  They tumble along the pipe.  Agile, Bond springs to his feet, pulls her up.  They run like hell for the hatch, into the darkness... 
EXT. PIPELINE - DAY 
The pipeline.  A long beat, then... 
KABOOM!!  A section of the pipe explodes, debris rocketing in every direction. 
As the smoke clears we see a fifty yard section of pipe has been destroyed. 
OMIT 223 
INT. PIPELINE CONTROL CENTER - SAME 
On the consoles, red concentric circles pulse outward from the point of impact, emitting one, monotone BEEP.... 
The watchers are frozen, stunned, shocked. Gabor, a radio earpiece in his ear, reports information. 
GABOR It wasn't nuclear...the bomb was a dud. The trigger charge blew out a fifty yard section of pipeline... 
M And Bond? 
An agonizing beat. The alarm beep sputters and dies. 
GABOR Nothing. 
M and Elektra share a look. 
ELEKTRA Do you think he's dead? 
M can't answer.  She shakes her head. 
M We just have to wait. 
Zukovsky dives away -- into a CAVIAR PIT.  The saws embed in the cabin behind him. 
The caviar pit is like sinking sand, deep -- he's going under.  Flounders, trying to cling to a crate blown in there by the explosion.  Then he looks in horror: 
EXT. SIDE OF CAVIAR PIT (OLD SC. 199) POV ZUKOVSKY: 
Bond appearing at the edge of the caviar pit, dragging himself up, soaking wet.  He's holding another harpoon gun. Points it directly at Zukovsky.  This time he really means business. 
EXT. CAVIAR PIT/SIDE (OLD SC. 200) 
Zukovsky, on the point of being swallowed by the caviar, clawing at the crate.  Bond, steely eyed, cold: 
BOND Now...where were we? 
ZUKOVSKY A rope! 
BOND No.  The truth! (beat) She thought I was dead -- those blades were meant for you.  What do you know that she would kill you for? 
Zukovsky is sinking. 
ZUKOVSKY I don't know what you're talking -- 
Zukovsky sees Christmas appear beside Bond: 
ZUKOVSKY Help me, don't let me drown. 
She looks to Bond -- sees he's serious. 
BOND (to Zukovsky) You're in this thing up to your neck. 
Zukovsky sinks alarmingly -- he talks rapidly, staccato: 
ZUKOVSKY Alright, alright!  Sometimes I smuggle machinery for her.  Russian stuff. 
BOND And the payoff on the tables? 
ZUKOVSKY A special job.  A...a...a submarine. 
CHRISTMAS What? 
ZUKOVSKY To haul some cargo. My nephew, he is Captain of a sub in the Black Sea Fleet. 
BOND Where's the sub going?! 
ZUKOVSKY No!  Get me out! 
BOND This is too big for even you.  Where is it? 
ZUKOVSKY This is a family matter! If my nephew is in danger, we do it my way, or nothing! Now get me out! 
But he looks more worried than ever as Bond takes aim with the harpoon gun -- squeezes the trigger. 
ZUKOVSKY No! Bond! 
CHRISTMAS (alarmed) Bond! 
Bond fires.  Zukovsky YELLS as the HARPOON SHOOTS TOWARD HIM. 
It takes him a moment to realize he hasn't been hit -- the harpoon splintering the crate, just missing him.  He clings to the crate, exhausted, as Bond and Christmas drag him to safety. 
CHRISTMAS Commander Bond, you are dangerous, unpredictable, and a hothead. 
He just looks at her. 
CHRISTMAS But then again, explosive devices are my specialty. 
Zukovsky scowls, wet, angry, looking from his ruined suit to the devastation that was once his caviar factory as, behind him, walkways CREAK, teeter, and CRASH into the sea. 
ZUKOVSKY So.  My way.  No MI-6, no Interpol.  Just you, me and my people. 
BOND Where? 
ZUKOVSKY Istanbul. 
OMITTED:233 
INT/EXT. BALCONY/MAIDEN'S TOWER - BOSPHORUS - NIGHT 
Beyond iron balustrades we see one of the most fabulous views in the world -- on one side the still waters of the Golden Horn, on the other, the dancing waves of the unsheltered Bosphorus -- and in between, the tumbling roofs, soaring minarets and crouching mosques of the Pera district. 
RENARD scans the water with night-vision binoculars. 
EXT. BOSPHORUS - NIGHT - HIS GREEN POV: 
A SUPERTANKER churns along... 
ADJUST ANGLE 
The CAMERA SINKS BENEATH THE WAVES, steals through the gloom - - eventually comes upon something sitting just beneath the belly of the tanker.  The silhouette of a SUBMARINE, hugging the tanker's shadow, creeping undetected into the Bosphorus... 
INT. M'S CELL - NIGHT 
M paces her cell.  Looks out, at the clock: 
It is MIDNIGHT.  Twelve hours to go. 
She crosses her arms.  Returns to pacing.  Puts her hands in her coat pockets: 
She feels something.  Takes it out. 
THE LOCATOR CARD.  Black and shiny, with two copper terminals on one end. 
ZUKOVSKY Any luck reaching Yevgeny? 
OPERATOR Negative, comrade. 
He moves to CHRISTMAS AND BOND, pouring over a large MAP OF ISTANBUL spread out on a table. 
CHRISTMAS (to Zukovsky) What is this place? 
ZUKOVSKY Former KGB surveillance post. The Dye Factory was just a front; now it turns a good profit. 
Bond notices THE BOA in the corner with some others. 
BOND Your old friend Dmitri. 
Zukovsky nods to his old friend. 
ZUKOVSKY Today, you are glad to have the Boa  on your side. 
Zukovsky looks at the map. 
ZUKOVSKY In the good old days, the KGB had three or four spots where our submarines could surface without anyone knowing. But Yevgeny is supposed to be loading cargo. 
CHRISTMAS What class sub does your nephew run? 
ZUKOVSKY C-class. 
BOND Nuclear. 
CHRISTMAS Not just nuclear. Powered by a nuclear reactor. (the penny drops) He's not loading any cargo. They want the sub. The sub itself. Put weapons grade plutonium inside the sub's reactor: Instant, catastrophic meltdown. 
BOND Made to look just like an accident. 
ZUKOVSKY Mother of God. 
BOND The right kind of explosion in the right spot -- it would block the Bosphorus, cut off the Black Sea. 
CHRISTMAS But why? Eight million people would die, the land irradiated for a hundred years. A cloud of radiation the size of Europe... 
BOND (chilled) Because an explosion like that would kill all the other pipelines. There would be only one way to get the oil out of the Caspian and pump it to the world... 
CHRISTMAS The King pipeline. 
BOND Elektra would control it all. 
ZUKOVSKY If what you say it true...it may be too late for Yevgeny. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - ISTANBUL - DAY 
The ancient arched underbelly of a waterside building. 
Something is disturbing a large expanse of water.  A black shadow looms beneath the waves.  A SUBMARINE SURFACES. 
INT. SECRET QUAY (MAIDEN'S TOWER) - ISTANBUL - DAY 
Waiting at the newly excavated quay:  Renard and his men. 
The submarine's hatch opens.  A YOUTHFUL CAPTAIN EMERGES, vaguely resembling his uncle, Zukovsky. 
RENARD Captain... 
YEVGENY Sir. We are ready to load your cargo. We only have a few hours before we'll be missed. 
RENARD You came with a skeleton crew? 
YEVGENY That's all we can afford these days. 
RENARD Of course. We are grateful for your efforts. 
One of his men comes forward with several bottles of brandy and other food. 
RENARD We have brandy and other refreshments for your men. 
The Captain nods, pleased. 
INT. DYE FACTORY 
Bond and Christmas and Zukovsky watch as the radio operators scan the airwaves. 
ZUKOVSKY If we're not in time and something has happened to him... you must let me kill them. 
Bond stares hard at him.  A long beat. 
BOND Whoever gets there first, Zukovsky.  They have M. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUBMARINE - DAY 
Eerie, dark, the lights inside green and sickly. 
CLOSE ON 
A half-eaten sandwich. An empty glass of brandy on the floor, just near the hand it fell from... 
PULL BACK TO SEE 
The dead face of Yevgeny, poisoned.  Others of his crew around, also dead. 
Renard and his men tour the grisly scene. 
BOND If I don't get to the Boa before he gets to Maiden's Tower, M is dead. 
Bond runs out, into 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Teeming with people, his eyes scanning, he spots...THE BOA climbing a ladder alongside a building to A ROOF. 
Bond chases after him, clambering up, but when he gets to the top of the roof... 
Boa has now been joined by THREE THUGS.  One attacks Bond as the Boa and the others move away... 
Bond fights with the thug, they stumble across the roof, gripping each other, until Bond gets the upper hand and THROWS HIM DOWN through a thatched roof where he falls... 
EXT. BAZAAR 
Into the market below. 
Christmas, just coming into the square, sees the body falling...she runs to the thug, thinking it might be Bond... 
But the thug raises up, smiling at her, blood on his teeth. 
She turns and runs...the thug gives chase... 
ON THE ROOFS ABOVE 
Bond is following Boa and the other two men as they LEAP from roof to roof. He sees them jump off onto the roof of... 
EXT. MOVING BUS 
Motoring rapidly away from him.  He makes a spectacular leap to a wobbly FLAG POLE that swings him toward the bus, dropping him on the roof before it SNAPS BACK, into the overhead TRAM WIRES ABOVE and setting off sparks. 
ON THE BUS 
Bond barely gets to his feet before Thug #2 is upon him. They grapple, struggling to maintain their footing as the bus speeds through the rickety old streets. He throws the guy over... 
The thug desperately CLINGS TO THE SIDE OF THE BUS... 
Bond now takes on the third thug, unaware that number two has climbed back on and is about to WHACK HIM ON THE HEAD with his gun when... 
THE BUS TURNS onto a new street...THE WIRES AGAIN...Thug Two's gun is caught up in them...he is instantly ELECTROCUTED. 
Thug three watches his friend's horrible death, giving Bond time to slug him hard across the face and THROW HIM FROM THE BUS... 
EXT. STREET 
Thug two's body goes SLAMMING INTO THE WINDSHIELD of a fast moving van...BURSTS OUT through the back doors of said van and tumbles out onto the street where it is HIT BY A CAR. 
ON THE BUS 
Bond turns back toward...BOA. Now it is just the two of them. 
The bus is hissing to a stop. 
The Boa leaps on to the bed of a passing truck.  Bond rushes forward and leaps on to the top of a passing taxi.  The taxi jams on his breaks and Bond rolls across the bonnet and on to the street.  He springs to his feet. 
Fifty yards ahead the truck carrying the Boa has stopped for traffic.  The Boa jumps out and darts into an alley. 
EXT. ISTANBUL - ALLEY - DAY 
The Alley leads into a small CAFE where PATRONS smoke water pipes and drink coffee.  The Boa is nowhere to be seen. 
Bond slips out his gun holding it out of sight close to his leg so as not to alarm the civilians.  He steps into the cafe. 
EXT. ISTANBUL - CAFE - DAY 
Bond makes his way through the tables to the doorway in the back.  He looks inside - just a few children  at play.  Bond is suddenly blind-sided by a vicious kidney punch which brings him to his knees.  He struggles to bring up his gun - but the Boa knocks it out of his hand. 
The Boa locks Bond's head in an unbreakable choke hold from behind.  Bond pulls on the massive arms - but to no avail. He glances down to his right - HIS GUN - just out of reach. 
Bond reaches out for it - his fingers just graze it. Suddenly the Boa's foot kicks out, knocking the gun across the room.  He tighten his grip and speaks in Bond's ear. 
BOA For years I was told I could never take the great James Bond and his Walther PPK. What good is your gun now, Bond? 
Bond can't breathe, his eyes start to dim.  He slumps forward, his left hand touches something hot.  It's the iron basket of coals used to keep the water pipes lite.  Bond's fingers touch the wire handle that arches across the top.  He grabs it and with his last reserves - 
Swings it at the back of his head hitting the Boa on the side of the head with the SOUND OF RAW BACON HITTING A HOT SKILLET. 
The Boa drops Bond and leaps to his feet holding the side of his face.  Bond falls forward fighting for breath and trying to clear his head. 
The Boa runs out the back door.  Bond finds his gun, holsters it and follows. 
EXT. ISTANBUL - SIDE STREET - DAY 
Bond comes out into a side street crowded with VENDERS AND SHOPPERS.  Bond sees the Boa pushing his way through the crowd to... 
EXT. ISTANBUL - FERRY TERMINAL - DAY 
RUSSIAN TRAMP STEAMER taking on cargo.  Bond enters square in time to see the Boa making a Bee line for the Russian steamer. 
As the Boa, much the worse-for-ware, starts up the gangway to the top deck of the steamer, Bond hitches a ride on a cargo net that is being hoisted aboard by the ship's boom. 
EXT. RUSSIAN STEAMER - DAY 
Boa, breathing hard gets to the deck.  He lumbers across it but before he can reach the other side he is tripped up by Bond who has been waiting for him by the side of the deck house.  The Boa goes sprawling.  As Bond comes for him he scrambles to his feet, grabs a nearby bailing hook, and swings at Bond.  But Bond is ready for him.  He wards off the blow with a small wooden cover from a shipping crate.  He traps the Boa's arm and gives him two quick devastating kicks in the solar plexus.  He Boa stages back to the railing.  A final kick from Bond sends him over the side... 
THE BOA FALLS, LANDING ON HIS BACK ON THE DECK BELOW WITH A SICKENING THUD. 
Bond looks down, sees the Boa's body at a horrible angle, his neck broken. 
Bond sighs, turns... 
INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE LOWER DECK - MOMENTS LATER 
Bond and Christmas get attacked.  A vicious, silent fight... Then the radio set sparks into life -- 
RENARD Open the tanks. 
Bond is throttling the man with the cable.  Speaks into the handset. 
BOND (disguising voice) Tanks open. 
But the man has stretched his hand to a fire alarm: 
The KLAXON RESOUNDS. 
INT. SUBMARINE CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Renard looks up. 
RENARD (to self) Bond... 
He flicks a switch; 
RENARD (into mic) Bond! You have decided to join me on this historic voyage.  Welcome to my nuclear family. 
INTERCUT: 
BOND ON AN INTERCOM: 
His voice fills the control room. 
BOND You're really going to commit suicide for her? 
Renard responds, into the microphone. 
RENARD In case you've forgotten.  I'm dead already. 
BOND Haven't you heard the news?  So is she. 
Renard's face screws up in pain more searing than any he could feel in his skin...he SCREAMS... 
INT. SUBMARINE... 
The scream, like a wounded animal, echoes throughout the doomed craft. 
BACK ON RENARD, gasping, spent. 
RENARD You will die for this. 
He strides through to the 
INT. REACTOR CHAMBER 
Jams shut the hatch behind him.  Now moves through to the 
INT. CHAMBER BEYOND REACTOR 
Where he picks up the PLUTONIUM. Moves back into the 
INT. REACTOR CHAMBER 
Sealing the other door behind him.  And now he opens up the cover of the glaring REACTOR... 
INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS 
Christmas sees a panel light up: 
CHRISTMAS The cover is off the reactor. 
Bond reads off more lights... 
BOND He's sealed himself in. 
CHRISTMAS He's going to insert the plutonium. 
Thinking fast, Bond moves to some controls.  Hits switches. 
CHRISTMAS Do you know what you're doing? 
BOND Like riding a bike. 
INT. AIR TANKS, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS 
The air tanks immediately filling with water. 
INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS 
Christmas and Bond shift to the side.  Everything not screwed down starts sliding... 
EXT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS - LONG SHOT 
The submarine is tilting, further and further, the nose dropping down and down... 
Pretty soon we have the strange and incredible sight of a submarine hanging vertically, nose down. 
INT. REACTOR CHAMBER, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS 
Renard hangs on, swings, until he can get a footing on the nearest wall. 
INT. TANK CONTROLS ROOM, SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS 
Bond and Christmas hang on too, get a grip.  He helps her up. 
INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS 
Christmas, shivering in the rising water. 
CHRISTMAS Twenty. 
She presses a button... 
INT. CHAMBER BEYOND (NOW ABOVE) REACTOR - CONTINUOUS 
The hatch opens and Bond collapses out in a gush of water. The hatch closes. 
The whole world is at a crazy angle here. Bond looks down at the sealed door of the reactor chamber, curses. 
INT. REACTOR CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 
Bathed in the horrible light of the over-heating reactor, Renard looks upwards, aware of sounds on the other side of the door... 
KER-BLAM!  A BLINDING FLASH OF LIGHT. 
The door shoots off its hinge, blasted by Bond. 
Bond drops down into the chamber, takes one look at Renard, now a crumpled heap in the corner. 
Bond moves down to the next door, opens it: 
BOND Christmas! 
And there she is, struggling, the water level way below still rising... 
He lowers an arm, pulls her up. 
They clamber up to the reactor: 
INT. REACTOR CHAMBER 
BOND'S POV: in the intense glow inside -- the overheating rod, protruding slightly. 
CHRISTMAS We have to get the rod out of the reactor! 
INT. REACTOR CHAMBER 
Bond looks at the gauges from behind a thick GLASS SHIELD. Christmas comes up level with him: 
CHRISTMAS Melting down.  4000 degrees, the Zirconium casings on the rods crack. 5000, the plutonium melts.  In ten minutes, a hydrogen explosion. 
THE TEMPERATURE GAUGE READS 4500 AND RISING... 
He starts toward the reactor when suddenly 
RENARD IS BEHIND BOND, THROTTLING HIM. 
CHRISTMAS grabs at him, is flung back, nearly falls through the hatch but manages to grab a pipe, hangs on for dear life. 
THE GAUGE HITS 4700 
BOND AND RENARD 
struggle...  Both slamming into switches and buttons. 
CUT TO: 
OMITTED 314-316 
INT. SUBMARINE - CONTINUOUS 
THE GAUGE IS PASSING 4900, EDGING TOWARDS THE NO-WAY-BACK 5000 MARK.  Meltdown imminent... 
He looks down the sub -- more water racing upward... 
Back to the pile.  Scans the scene, searching for an idea. Sees a HOSE, compressed air escaping from a fissure.  Thinks fast.  Grabs the hose, snaps it free... 
RENARD 
is recovering, has found a FLARE GUN near him.  Raises it to Bond... 
BOND'S POV 
in the reflection of the gauge (which is millimeters from 5000), we see Renard approaching from behind us... 
BOND jams the hose into the reactor, ducks down -- as the air blows the rod out - narrowly missing him as it shoots past -- impales Renard in the heart, just before he could shoot. 
Renard stares at Bond in horror.  Bond calmly takes the flare gun off him. 
BOND She's waiting for you. 
And he lets him fall past Christmas, through consecutive open hatches of the sub, crashing into the rising water. 
Christmas looks down at the floating corpse. 
Bond watches the gauge -- as it edges DOWN from 5000. 
The nuclear disaster looks like it's averted.  But suddenly water is gushing in from above, through splits in the sub's shell; it's going to sink. 
BOND We're sinking. 
But she won't come.  As water courses over them: 
CHRISTMAS Help me.  We have to seal it. 
She moves to the reactor, closing the cover.  Bond uses his strength to push the heavy locking mechanism into place.

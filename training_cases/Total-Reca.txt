"TOTAL RECALL" 
FADE IN: 
1       EXT. DESERT - DAY 
All we can see, filling the entire frame is a flame-orange sky...almost like the sky from the burning of Atlanta in "Gone with the Wind". 
SUPERIMPOSE:  Presenter credit. 
PAN DOWN lower and lower until we see the terrain below... the desert.  There is no vegetation whatever, just sand and odd-shaped rock formations.  The air is filled with red dust, which alternately obscures and then reveals the image. CAMERA MOVES FORWARD optically - enlarging the film grain in the process. 
SLOW DISOLVE 
OPENING CREDITS BEGIN. 
ANOTHER SHOT of a barren landscape, once more with bizarre rocks.  Dust.  Sound of wind.  CAMERA MOVES FORWARD again. DISSOLVE. 
ANOTHER LANDSCAPE, but this time, in the distance are some enormous plastic domes.  Sunlight striking them and reflect- ing causes brilliant rainbows.  CAMERA optically tracks toward the dome, seen in tantalizingly indistinct fashion through the red dust.  DISSOLVE... 
ANOTHER ANGLE, and, in the distance, on the horizon of the arid landscape is a huge SPHINX-LIKE STRUCTURE.  (It is reminiscent of the Egyptian sphinx, but both body and face, though gargoyle-like, are different in design.)  There are some large pyramids not far from the sphinx.  CAMERA MOVES optically FORWARD.  DISSOLVE. 
CAMERA is much closer to the sphinx and is directly in front. It moves (combination of zoom and optical printer move) towards the eyes, which appear to be red gems. 
As CAMERA APPROACHES one of the eyes, it appears to be stained red glass, as in a temple.  Suddenly there is a terrific explosion and the glass shatters into millions of fragments which hurtle toward the camera... 
2       INT. CATACOMB BELOW "SPHINX" - DAY 
A MAN wearing a LIGHTWEIGHT THERMAL SUIT is RUNNING THROUGH THIS LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES under him, as if in an earthquake.  We cannot clearly make out his face, especially since he wears some kind of BREATHING APPARATUS over a portion of it. 
The surface of the tunnel's "walls" is curious;  the walls are, again, bright reddish orange, and a composite of two different substances:  rough-textured, clay-like material and red quartz, which glistens like crystal. 
The man throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fear- fully, as he runs.  His HANDS are SPLATTERED with BLOOD. Because of this, the RED GLOW, the air of FEAR to the man, and the GROUND HEAVING and BUCKLING, there is almost a SATANIC suggestion to the scene. 
Suddenly, up AHEAD of the man, there appears a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT.  He SEES IT, and runs even faster towards it. 
We are ALMOST UP TO THE LIGHT, and we SEE HANDS REACHING OUT OF THE LIGHT TOWARDS US... that seem to beckon him to SAFETY. 
ABRUPTLY, the ENTIRE SCREEN GOES RED, BUT IN REVERSE NEGATIVE; with YELLOW LAYOVERS.  (So that all the images we see -- ENTIRE FRAME -- are small YELLOW AREAS diffused on a RED BACKGROUND.)  It is much like looking at a tableau made out of molten lava. 
SUPERIMPOSE MAIN TITLE: 
TOTAL RECALL 
HOLD. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
QUAIL We can pool our savings and I've got some sick leave coming, besides my regular vacation... 
KIRSTEN (interrupting; corrects herself) ...more of a half-wit.  For a start a war could break out there any day ... 
She gestures toward the TV screen where Martian police are keeping protesters behind a barrier.  Some have signs reading "A FREE MARS", "DOWN WITH COHAAGEN", "EARTH - OUT" etc. 
QUAIL That's just media talk.  They're... (indicating the protesters) ...just a minority.  They're powerless. 
KIRSTEN Well, there's a lot of things we need around here before we waste our money on a trip to Mars.  We're broke.  I'm just a slave around this dump. Now if you were capable of finding a better job.... 
The kitchen clock chimes and talks. 
CLOCK It's now eight.  You'll be late! 
QUAIL I'll be late! 
He jumps up quickly from the table, picks up his coat and briefcase, kisses KIRSTEN's perfunctorily offered cheek and leaves. 
4A      EXT. CITY - EARLY MORNING 
CAMERA TRACKS with Quail as he walks along the busy modern street towards a subway station.  Modern cars (out of focus) pass noiselessly between the camera and Quail.  There is a plaintive tune being played on violin.  Quail pauses and gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on briskly. 
5       INT. SUBWAY STATION - EARLY MORNING 
Quail enters the station.  Everybody must pass through a weapons check before proceeding to the platforms. 
TWO ARMED GUARDS stand at either side, as commuters pass through an electronic beam.  On a screen, the entire body of each person is seen in X-ray.  All of them are clearly carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket. 
GUARD No weapon again, Mr. Quail? 
QUAIL I keep forgetting, Herb.  They frighten me. 
GUARD Yeah?  Well, it's the law, Mr. Quail.  Has been since 1990 they tell me.  Tomorrow - ya carry ya gun or ya get reported. 
GUARD gestures to his associate.  They've obviously been through this with Quail before. 
QUAIL Okay.  Herb, okay. 
Quail walks on to the track area.  The train arrives. Signs above each approaching car say "CAR FULL", "ROOM FOR 10 PERSONS", etc.  Quail goes to a carriage marked "NEW CAR". 
6       INT. URBAN TRANSIT TRAIN - DAY 
The doors open and the crowd surges on.  Quail grabs a seat.  At intervals throughout the car are VIDEO MONITORS on which a NEWS BROADCAST is showing. 
NEWSCASTER (V.O.) -- more violence today from Mars's strike-torn ore colonies -- 
Everyone ignores the broadcast -- except Quail, who perks instantly at the word "Mars." 
The NEWSCASTER is a young black man. 
NEWSCASTER (continuing) ...but Earth Intelligence Operations Director Vilos Cohaagen, clearly worried about the damage to Mars's all important tourist industry was today dismissive of the dissident groups.... 
TV scene switches to a press conference.  COHAAGEN, sur- rounded by AIDES, steps in front of a podium packed with news network microphones and cameras.  Cohaagen is a striking, intense man with an obvious air of power. 
COHAAGEN We're dealing with a bunch of extremists and unrepresentative lunatics.  Mars is a happy and prosperous protectorate of Earth... and will remain so. 
The train stops at another station and more people pile on. Quail tries to watch the broadcast through the bodies passing in front of him and intermittently blocking the image. 
REPORTER (V.O.) There have been some criticisms, sir.... 
COHAAGEN I have no further comment. 
LULL The Narkadine cracked a memory cap.  Mars -- (she's scared) He's really been there. 
There is a chilly silence in the room as McClane digests this. 
McCLANE Forced suppression? 
ERNIE With spontaneous breakthrough. 
McCLANE Holy shit. 
They stare at Quail as if he's a ticking bomb. 
QUAIL (coldly) You've compromised the Sphinx Project.  You'll have to be silenced. 
Now they're all panicked. 
McCLANE Wait a minute.  Quail -- 
QUAIL My name isn't Quail. 
McCLANE Listen... whoever you are... sir.... (almost pleading) ...This is all an accident. We'll destroy all the records. No one will know.  I swear it. Believe me. 
QUAIL I believe you, but that won't stop E.T.O. from killing you. 
The Rekall people stare at each other in quiet horror. 
QUAIL (continuing) Killing you... killing you... killing you.... 
His voice trails off, his eyes close. 
LULL (intensely) He wants a false memory implanted -- of a trip he really took. (pause) Someone at Earth Intelligence Operations erased his memory. All he know was going to Mars meant something special to him. 
ERNIE What do we do?  Graft a false memory pattern over the real memory of the same thing? 
LULL (shaking her head) Uh-uh... That could promote a partial breakthrough of the real trip. 
McCLANE (overlapping) Revive him without any false memory implantation and get him out of here. 
LULL Why don't we just wipe out the memory of his visit here? 
McCLANE (nodding; relieved) Yes.  Good.  I'll destroy his file and cancel his fee. I have a feeling that the longer he doesn't know who he is, where he's been, where he's going and who we are, the better off we'll all be.  I'm taking a holiday. A real one. 
He leaves.  The others stare after him, looking very grim. 
12A     INT. RECEPTION AREA OF REKALL - DAY 
A dazed and disoriented Douglas Quail comes out of an inner door and walks through the lobby towards the exit door. 
An attractive RECEPTIONIST, her bare breasts visible through a clear plastic blouse, watches him; she then looks toward McClane who has half-opened the door to view Quail's progress. 
12B     INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 
Quail travels down.  Uncomprehendingly, he looks out at the city. 
12C     INT. BUILDING FOYER - DAY 
Quail stumbles through the fairly crowded foyer, oblivious to anything around him.  A red-headed man may or may not be watching him.  He makes a phone call from a pocket phone. 
12D     INT. ROBOT TAXI CAB - AFTERNOON 
Scene open on Quail, in the back of the cab; he looks around, slowly coming to his senses. 
He sits down, holds his hand to his head. 
KIRSTEN (continuing) It's all a fabrication, Quail. Everything you know. 
QUAIL This is crazy!  If all my memories are false, who am I?  What am I?  Jesus... it's like I don't exist. 
KIRSTEN You exist, all right. (very cold) That's the problem. 
A pause as Quail mentally gropes frantically, for what to do next. 
QUAIL Why did you try to kill me? Why does E.I.O. want me dead? 
KIRSTEN They don't particularly.  That was my idea.  This assignment was boring me to death.  The personality they gave you wasn't too thrilling. 
QUAIL Well, what did I do on Mars that they have to keep me from telling? 
KIRSTEN I've no idea.  I just work here. 
QUAIL All right... I'm leaving. Don't try and follow me -- 
KIRSTEN I don't have to follow you. You can't get away from E.I.O. Nobody does. 
Quail looks at her as if seeing her for the first time. 
QUAIL No wonder you got the role as my bitchy wife -- type casting. 
He leaves.  Kirsten smiles secretively.  She goes to a drawer, opens it and removes a tiny instrument that looks like a TV channel-changer.  There is a very small light on the instrument, which begins flashing on and off, as the instrument  begins to make BEEPING SOUNDS. 
21      EXT. STREET OUTSIDE QUAIL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Quail walks briskly out onto the street, controlling his paces, trying not to look suspicious.  After a beat, he heads for the nearest subway entrance. 
22      INT. SUBWAY STATION - NIGHT 
Now underground, Quail tries to blend in with the other subway people.  He heads toward the weapons check. 
23      EXT. STREET SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT 
An OFFICIAL VEHICLE slams to a halt next to the subway entrance and a whole load of INTENSE MEN pours out of it. 
24      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 
Quail now shuffles along in a lineup of people waiting to get through the WEAPONS CHECK.  He tries to control his nervousness.  He passes.  The guard smiles at him, pleased to see he has remembered his gun. 
25      INT. SUBWAY - NIGHT 
All the men with guns drawn come pouring down the subway stairs.  The SUBWAY COPS and WEAPONS CHECK are stunned to see four large men brandishing guns push their way through the weapons check gate without seeming to notice them.  One gunman flashes a HOLOGRAPHIC BADGE ENCASED IN PLASTIC at them. 
The gunman reach the bottom of the stairs and race closer to the subway train, which is just departing.  The men halt abruptly. 
FIRST GUNMAN Fuck it! 
The second gunman adjusts a small plug - a radio receiver - in his ear. 
SECOND GUNMAN (EARPLUG WEARER) We won't be able to track him again until he comes up above ground! 
26      INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT 
Quail sits in the subway car as it barrels through the night, not knowing exactly where he will go.  He is confused, distraught.  A commercial comes onto the video. 
TV AS VOICE OVER Tired?  Exhausted?  Need a vacation?  Don't settle for memories, experience the real thing.  Daily departures on the space shuttle to Mars.  Visit the wonders of.... 
QUAIL (handing over money) Here's ten thousand.  Forget the ID. 
DESK CLERK looks up at him, with interest.  His hand hovers over the money. 
QUAIL (continuing) I have a liaison with a lady... and I'm married... 
DESK CLERK I understand, sir.  Nothing like a bit on the side, eh? Bit of fugitive flesh.  The greatest aphrodisiac is a new body, wouldn't you say, sir? 
Quail looks at him with distaste but is only anxious to be given the key to his room.  He says nothing. 
30      INT. "END OF THE LINE" HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Quail unlocks the door and enters.  No sooner does he relock the door then THE PHONE RINGS.  He freezes, stares at it for three rings, then picks it up. 
QUAIL (into receiver) I told you, I don't want to be disturbed. 
TELEPHONE VOICE (filtered) If you want to live, don't hand up. 
Quail is stunned.  He says nothing, but doesn't hang up. 
TELEPHONE VOICE (continuing; filtered) They've got you bugged... They're gonna find you. Faster than you can say "Back Rodgers". (quickly) And don't bother shaking down your clothes -- the monitor is embedded in your skull. 
QUAIL (reeling) Who are you?  What the hell is this? 
30A     INT. BAR BASEMENT - NIGHT 
The man telephoning Quail is calling from a bar.  Occasion- ally people pass him on their way to the toilets.  He is youngish and conservatively dressed.  He speaks rapidly and urgently. 
TELEPHONE VOICE Take a wet towel and wrap it around your head.  That will deaden the signal.  It'll take longer for them to pinpoint you. 
30B     INT QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
QUAIL Why should I trust you? 
TELEPHONE VOICE (filtered) There's a real old saying - "Beggars can't be choosers". Go and soak your head! 
Quail puts the phone down and rushes to the bathroom. 
30B1    INT. PATROL CAR - NIGHT 
The earphone wearer and driver are moving in on the signal generated by Quail's bug.  Suddenly, the small illuminated cross on the dashboard map cuts out. 
EARPHONE WEARER Shit! 
DRIVER Cut the language, will ya? 
EARPHONE WEARER It's gone!  Some...malfunction... 
Unscientifically, he prod the screen. 
DRIVER (world-weary air) Toldya the Martian assembled [stuff don't work.] 
30B2    INT. QUAIL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Quail rushes back into the room with a wet towel, turban-like, wrapped around his head.  He rapidly picks up the phone. 
QUAIL Keep talking. 
TELEPHONE VOICE (filtered) Head over to Skid Row -- to the Lucky Stub Pawnshop -- corner of Park Avenue and Fifty-eighth.  Tell the man you're Mr. Hotchkiss; you came for your Grecian candlesticks. 
QUAIL (infuriated) What do I want with Grecian candlesticks! 
QUAIL ENTERS FRAME, and approaching the pawnshop, stepping over a BUM in a doorway. 
34      INT. PAWNSHOP - NIGHT 
Quail is just entering; an old-fashioned BELL overhead, tripped by the door opening, announces his entrance. 
At once, an immense FAT MAN emerges from the back room. 
PAWNBROKER You wanta camera?  I got some good, top-quality ones.  You want silk rugs?  Handmade last century in Iran...all perfect. You want videos?  Old movies... classics...all those Vietnam war ones...real quaint stuff... you want... 
QUAIL (interrupting; awkwardly) I'm Hotchkiss...I came for the...Grecian candlesticks... 
The Fat Man studies him warily for a long moment; then he disappears through the curtain. 
In a brief moment, he emerges again, carrying a small, "makeup-sized" case, as well as two large candelabra. 
The Pawnbroker puts the case on the counter.  Quail looks at the case with curiosity. 
QUAIL (continuing) I wonder if you could tell me... 
They both look around as someone enters. 
PAWNBROKER I trust these will look well in you... mosque. 
35      INT. FLOP HOUSE - NIGHT - CLOSE ON HANDS 
Opening up the small case. 
PULL BACK to reveal they are Quail's hands.  The hotel room he's now in is obviously a different one than the last one we saw him in.  The room is large but run-down, the walls are peeling, the architecture is much older, etc. 
Quail examines the contents of the case:  there are CREDIT CARDS and also MONEY, several stacks of bills, neatly tied -- some of it the conventional green, but most of it red. 
CLOSE ON RED MONEY 
On the face of it is printed:  "MARS FEDERAL COLONY". 
QUAIL (mutters) Martian money.... 
Quail thumbs through the money, and whistles softly to himself as he sees how much there is. 
Also in the case are:  TWO PASSPORTS;  a small CASSETTE RECORDER;  a rolled-up LEATHER POUCH and a spray can of some sort;  and a strange thing that looks like a silver mask.  He examines the face mask, studies BLACK LETTERS WRITTEN ACROSS IT (which we are not close enough to read) and then puts it aside.  Another item now catches  his eye:  a wristwatch.  He sees a conspicuous red button on the side of the watch, and PRESSES IT.  INSTANTLY, TO HIS SHOCK, QUAIL SEES A MAN MANIFEST HIMSELF HIMSELF OUT OF THIN AIR AND STAND THERE IN THE ROOM A FEW FEET AWAY FROM QUAIL:  he's an EXACT HOLOGRAPHIC DUPLICATE of Quail -- down to the clothes Quail is wearing now. 
The image stands and watches Quail. 
QUAIL (continuing) What the hell...? 
Quail smiles, presses the red button again.  There is a HUMMING SOUND -- and the man FADES INTO THIN AIR -- like a television set being turned off. 
Quail looks bemused. 
Now he unrolls the leather pouch and looks inside.  There he finds what look like SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS;  a sponge, a long piece of wire doubled over, with some attachments and a tiny METAL HEAD on one end, and some tubes of salve. 
He turns on the cassette recorder. 
The VOICE he hears on the cassette TAPE is HIS OWN! 
CASSETTE VOICE (V.O.) (Quail's voice) "Hauser, this is Hauser -- or whatever you think your name is now.  If you're listening to this, I'm talking to myself. Your memory's been erased and you've got a wet towel around your head. (he does) "The first thing you've got to do is get rid of that bug in your head." 
36      INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT 
The sound of the tape continues as Quail follows instructions - pushing the wire up into a bloody portion of his neck, just below the ear. 
The red-headed man nods. 
COHAAGEN (continuing) Are you sure the original suppression took? 
SUPERVISOR Absolutely, sir.  He thinks he's Quail, a computer... 
COHAAGEN (interrupting) Then how do you explain what he's doing? 
SUPERVISOR Just his instincts.  He was well trained by E.I.O.... Maybe the memory cap's fractured. Portions of his prior identity could be leaking through. 
COHAAGEN (very anxious) He'll remember Mars?  The Sphinx Project? 
SUPERVISOR Fragments.  Nothing more. Nothing he could piece together. I did advise terminating him, rather than implanting an identify alternative. 
COHAAGEN What do you think I am?  A barbarian?  We're not living in the twentieth century! 
He looks at the video screen again.  An image has flashed onto it of an attractive Eurasian girl. 
COHAAGEN (continuing) Hold it there. 
He studies the picture, which changes to show the same girl from different angles. 
42      INT. SPACE PORT - DAY 
Passengers are boarding a COMMERCIAL SPACECRAFT.  In addition to the STEWARDESSES checking their tickets, there are two PLAINCLOTHES MEN checking every passenger.  They carry some kind of small, portable ELECTRONIC DEVICE that they shine in the face of each passenger going through. (It gives off a BLUE BEAM and HUMS.) 
The passengers are a diverse group - businessmen, officials, government people, etc.  There is also a large tour group consisting of a predominately middle-aged and determinedly jolly crowd, many of them carrying duty-free bags.  They are being marshaled by an harassed TOUR ORGANIZER, who is carrying aloft a hand-painted sign... "MARTIAN TOUR GROUP". 
The last of the passengers board the spacecraft.  The chief PLAINCLOTHES MAN nods to an official and the door begins to close. 
PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1 If he had to travel to Mars with that bunch, I'd be sorry for him. 
PLAINCLOTHES MAN #2 We couldn't have missed him? 
PLAINCLOTHES MAN #1 No way.  Let's get a coffee before the next shuttle. 
43      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT 
One of the PASSENGERS -- a middle-aged WOMAN - unbuckles her seat belt and heads for the restroom, carrying her handbag, and some clothes on a hanger. 
44      INT. LAVATORY - IN FLIGHT 
The woman locks the door and turns to the mirror.  She opens her bag, takes out a spray container, SPRAYS HER FACE with it, and takes out -- the SILVER FACE MASK we saw in Quail's emergency kit. 
She holds the mask to her face.  There is a SIZZLING NOISE, and SMOKE rises from behind the mask. 
She lowers the mask.  Her face is now that of QUAIL. He tears up a passport and drops it down a chute. 
He reaches inside his dress, starts to REMOVE his "FALSIES." 
CLOSE ON MASK 
We can read the BLACK LETTERING written across it now: "LASER FACIAL". 
45      INT. SPACELINER - IN FLIGHT 
Quail exits from the lavatory and glances toward the ebullient tour crowd.  He turns and looks in the other direction and sees a video theater advertising "ROCKY 36" with Sylvester Stallone III, Jnr.  He isn't too excited, but heads towards it.  He pauses a little when an announcement comes over the intercom. 
A LITTLE BELL sounds, followed by INTERCOM STATIC.  Quail looks up. 
CAPTAIN'S VOICE (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll glance out the starboard viewports, you'll behold an indeed awesome sight -- 
BOY Smogpsucker! 
From the other side of the street, a gang of URCHINS with a harmonica start singing some kind of defiant PATRIOTIC SONG. 
DOORMAN You know how it is, sir.  Some of these red-asses are a bit prejudiced. 
QUAIL Prejudiced?  Against what? 
DOORMAN Earthmen. 
The street song has swelled, adult MINERS and CITIZENS joining the belligerent chorus. 
QUAIL What are they singing? 
DOORMAN The Martian National Anthem. 
Quail tips the doorman, enter the hotel. 
57      INT. MARS HILTON LOBBY - DAY 
Quail passes several kiosks -- a magazine stand, currency exchange, clothing store, shoeshine stand.  A SHOESHINE BOY looks up at Quail. 
Quail walks past, enters the main lobby.  The atrium entryway is absolutely fabulous; a complete contrast to the dirty, Casbah-like streets.  AFFLUENT-LOOKING PEOPLE in spotless linen fill the lobby. 
Quail stops to examine a large ROTATING DISPLAY sitting on a table in the middle of the lobby.  It is a stand-up model of a SPHINX.  Across the top is written "THE FIRST WONDER OF MARS".  A recorded VOICE repeats a canned speech -- 
CANNED VOICE "...the Martian Sphinx... only evidence of non-human civilization ever discovered ...age estimated at over eighteen million years... 
CLOSE - SHOESHINE BOY 
He stares at Quail. 
BACK TO SCENE 
Quail approaches the Registration Desk. 
CLERK Nice to have you back with us, Mr. Hauser. 
Quail is startled to be recognized -- particularly by this name.  He tries to stay casual. 
QUAIL Nice to be back. (pick up pen) I'm flattered you remember me. 
CLERK Part of my job, sir. 
QUAIL (starts to sign; hesitates) Do you remember my first name, too? 
CLERK Charles.  Charles Hauser, right? 
QUAIL I'm impressed. (now he signs) Listen.  I need transportation to the... uh... the Sphinx. Can you arrange it for me? 
CLERK I'm sorry, sir.  But Earth government has sealed off the excavation site completely. No one but survey teams and archaeologists are allowed closer than twenty miles. 
The Clerk taps a few keys on a computer. 
CLERK Oh... (spots something on the computer) Do you want the item you left with us? 
QUAIL What item?  Oh... yes, please. 
The Clerk turns to the safe, retrieves an envelope. He hands it -- and an ELECTRONIC ROOM KEY -- to Quail. 
58      P.O.V. - THROUGH BINOCULARS - THE SPHINX 
MINER #5 ...aw, come on... flyin's safer'n crossin' the road... 
MINER #6 ...yeah, there ain't been a real disaster since that collision off Phobos, nigh on twenty years ago... 
MINER #4 (alarmed) ...well, that killed twelve thousand... 
QUAIL What is this, Bennie... Tombstone? 
BENNIE Sorta.  Bunch of miners out here got their own claims, from way back.  Cohaagen's buyin' em all up, says he's gonna cut off the air an' water if they won't sell... 
Quail attracts the attention of the BARTENDER. 
QUAIL I'm looking for Melina Noel. 
BARTENDER You've found her. 
His nod indicates an area behind Quail.  He turns to see an attractive waitress placing drinks on tables.  She doesn't notice Quail.  He walks toward her through the crowd.  Bennie watches, then tactfully slips away. 
MELINA turns to return to the bar and runs straight into Quail.  She stops, obviously astonished to see him. 
MELINA You bastard! 
Almost in tears, she pushes her way through the crowd to a billiard room, which is separated from the main bar by swinging doors. 
There are no occupants and it is almost in darkness.  Quail, bewildered, follows her.  Inside the billiard room he turns on the lights which illuminates the area of the table. 
(NOTE:  As Quail and Melina speak, the activity in the outside bar can be seen above the swinging doors.) 
Melina is still fighting back tears.  Quail stops in front of her, unsure about what to do.  He has no recollection of how well he might have known this woman. 
Suddenly, she slaps him hard across the face. 
MELINA (quietly) You bastard... 
He rubs his painful cheek. 
MELINA (continuing) That's new -- the innocent look. (bitter sarcasm) You didn't have that one before. (beat) Well? 
Quail is speechless. 
QUAIL Well, uh... I... 
MELINA All right, I'll say it for you. 
He looks relieved (but tries to cover). 
MELINA (continuing) Don't worry.  I got the note. You discharged your obligation. 
QUAIL What note? 
MELINA Oh, the usual one.  "Must return immediately to Earth... the wife needs me..." 
QUAIL I don't have a wife.  Well, I do - but not a real wife. (getting desperate) Hell... look... someone else sent that note.  Someone who -- 
MELINA What are you here for?! 
QUAIL For you!  I don't even know why -- 
Melina bursts into tears.  Quail rather tentatively puts his arms around her.  She welcomes this at first, but then pushes him away. 
QUAIL (continuing) Whoever I was, I must have been a helluva guy. 
QUAIL If this is a fantasy, there'll be no real consequences when I pull this trigger. 
EDGEMAR But there will by consequences inside your mind.  Consequences that won't hurt me... but could be fatal to you. (beat) If you shoot me, you'll wipe me out of your fantasy -- I can't come back again.  Because to you, I'll be dead.  I can't help you get back to reality. You'll be stuck in permanent psychosis. 
CLOSE - QUAIL 
Trembling, holding the gun point blank in Edgemar's face. 
CLOSE - EDGEMAR 
Showing no fear of tension whatever. 
EDGEMAR You're going to lower the gun, Mr. Quail.  You're going to hand it to me -- 
CLOSE - QUAIL 
Straining desperately to find the true "reality." 
EXTREME CLOSEUP - TRIGGER OF GUN 
Quail's finger on it. 
TWO SHOT - QUAIL AND EDGEMAR 
EDGEMAR You're going to do exactly what I tell you -- 
Quail PULLS THE TRIGGER! 
REVERSE ANGLE - BACK OF EDGEMAR'S HEAD 
We SEE the results of the gunshot from this angle only, and so BRIEFLY as to produce an almost SUBLIMINAL effect: the back of Edgemar's head blows off -- 
He collapses to the floor. 
Melina LEAPS at Edgemar's falling form and CLAMPS HER HANDS over Edgemar's RIGHT HAND! 
MELINA Watch out, Charles!  There's more of them in the hall! 
Quail spins toward the door just as it BURSTS OPEN.  A man enters, firing, but Quail has fallen to the floor and returns the fire.  He staggers back out into the corridor and slams against the wall, dead. 
VOICE (O.S.) (from hall) You've had it, Hauser!  Throw out your weapon if you want a past! 
Melina is still crouched by Edgemar's body, holding his HAND for some reason.  Her CLIPBOARD dangles by her side. 
MELINA (whispering) There's an explosive in the clipboard!  He has a dead-man switch in his hand! 
Squeezing Edgemar's hand shut with one of hers, she holds up her other wrist -- to show that the CLIPBOARD IS BOUND TO HER WRIST BY A CHAIN! 
VOICE (O.S.) What do you say, Hauser?  We haven't got all night!  Hauser? 
Quail (Hauser) SHOOTS OFF the chain. 
QUAIL What happens it I come out? 
Quail takes the CLIPBOARD from Melina and eases himself to the side of the doorway. 
VOICE (O.S.) We'll put in a word with the big boys.  Maybe you'll just get exile to Venus. 
QUAIL All right.  Here comes the weapon. 
Quail reaches around the corner and SAILS THE CLIPBOARD into the hallway.  Melina lets go of Edgemar's hand -- 
A large gas-powered official-looking car is pushing its way through the crowds and traffic behind them. 
86B     INT. BENNIE'S CAR - NIGHT 
Quail is aiming his gun at the following car. 
BENNIE Forget the shooter, boss.  I lose 'em for you. 
QUAIL Lose them?  In this? 
BENNIE Hang on! 
Bennie reaches down, grasps a KNOB.  He yanks it, like someone starting an outboard motor -- and an ear-splitting LOUD ENGINE roars to life. 
Bennie opens the throttle and the solar car HURTLES DOWN THE STREET.  Quail and Melina are thrown back in the seat. 
87      EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 
GUNFIRE blazes all around the car.  Quail FIRES back at the pursuing car. 
QUAIL (shouts over GUNFIRE) You're gonna get a ticket for that engine, Bennie -- 
BENNIE Yutani 650 -- you like it, boss?  Nothing like the old gas when you want a bit of speed. 
BULLETS from the cruiser rip through the car. 
MELINA You better have two aces, Bennie. (glances behind) There's a second cruiser -- and it's gaining -- 
87A     EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
Bennie's car hurtles through the crowds with the official car gaining on it.  Bennie takes a corner sharply near a huge water selling stand.  The official car brakes to make the same turn, but clips the side of the water stand.  The water container tips and empties water through the open roof (i.e. through which one of the Agents has been firing) so that the car completely fills.  The driver continues the chase, but the occupants are now submerged.  They frantic- ally open the windows while continuing to follow Bennie's car. 
88      EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT 
The solar car rushes down what appears to be a dead-end street, with the official vehicle (water pouring out of the windows) in pursuit. 
At the end of the street, however, Bennie doesn't stop but continues going into a large opening.  It is an abandoned mine.  The bigger car follows him, but won't fit.  The roof is smashed to pieces as the vehicle is wedged into the narrow opening. 
The second official car pulls up behind.  A chauffeur jumps out and opens the rear door.  Cohaagen steps out.  He sur- veys the scene.  The four men in the wrecked car clamber their way backwards out of the wreckage.  They are covered in blood and their clothes are in shreds. 
COHAAGEN I take it, then, you've failed to get him again. 
Cohaagen turns to an associate, EMILE, a youngish, well-dressed executive type. 
COHAAGEN (continuing) Proceed with Operation Sphinx. 
EMILE But, sir... 
COHAAGEN With him... (gestures toward the mine) ...on the lose, I'm not taking any more chances. Operation Sphinx will flush him out. 
93      INT. OLD MINE - NIGHT 
The solar car proceeds along the tunnel.  It enters an area full of smoke.  Dozens of men are sitting around smoking cigarettes, pipes and cigars.  Quail looks at them in amazement. 
QUAIL What's all this? 
BENNIE Nothin', boss.  Just old smokies.  Only place they can come for a puff.  It's all banned topside. 
They have now climbed out of the car.  Quail looks searchingly at Melina and Bennie. 
QUAIL So you two are into something a bit more serious than the taxi and truck-stop business. 
A man enters from another room.  Although the man's features are East Indian, he is very much a Peter Lorre type;  he wears a small fez cap and a white linen robe with a cowl draped around the back of his neck. 
STRANGE MAN (nodding to Quail) Your servant, Fahreem Kuato. I greet you by the twenty-seven names that still remain, praying that you cast jewels into the darkness and given them to glow with the colors of life. 
As Kuato speaks, Quail, unimpressed, talks, sotto voce, to Melina. 
QUAIL What use is this weirdo? 
MELINA Ssssh...there are skills on mars that Earth has forgotten. 
KUATO No need to introduce yourself, Mr. Quail. (smiles at Quail's surprise) Tolerate my presumption, but it does not tax my powers to know that you are the most sought-after man on two worlds. 
From the street the sound of loudspeakers giving information about Quail and Co. can be heard.  Searchlight beams occasionally sweep past the windows. 
KUATO (continuing) This way, my dear man.  We have much to accomplish -- (ominously) -- and very little time. 
102     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT 
A Bysantine salon filled with enormous Oriental pillows. 
(NOTE:  In the scenes inside Kuato's sanctum, the loudspeaker vans in the outside streets can be heard from time to to time.  They are repeating the evacuation message from scene 99, but alternating it with a call for the apprehension of Quail and Melina... 
VOICE FROM LOUDSPEAKER ...for information leading to these arrests, first-class travel to Earth will be provided plus a weekend at the Leningrad Disneyworld, all expenses paid.  I repeat, an Oriental girl and Earthman, possibly to be found in the company of a black taxi driver. These are dangerous subversives and sworn enemies of the glorious Peoples Republic of Mars...) 
KUATO The turbulence you hear outside is but a reflection of the turmoil within you. You have brought it to Mars in your search for yourself. 
Kuato takes a seat on the pillows, invites the others to join him.  Quail hesitates. 
QUAIL And you're going to help me by reading my mind? 
KUATO Indubitably.  There is only small matter of a fee. 
THREE RESPONSES COME TOGETHER. 
QUAIL A fee! 
KAUTO Naturally. 
MELINA This is for our cause! 
KUATO (soothingly) Income before ideals.  Shall we say five-hundred-thousand dollars? 
QUAIL (appalled) Five-hundred-thousand Martian dollars, that's... (think, calculating the exchange rate) 
KUATO Not Martian dollars, Mr. Quail - Earth dollars. 
MELINA That's interplanetary robbery! 
QUAIL With today's exchange rate... that's over two million Martian dollars! 
KUATO (suave) What price do you put, Mr. Quail, on the future of the solar system? 
BENNIE Aw, come off it, man.  Just for a bit of mumbo-jumbo with a crystal ball. 
KUATO (his manner slipping) Listen, buster, we're talking heavy stuff here.  You try and work out what's with this guy! 
He jerks his thumb toward Quail. 
QUAIL Okay!  Okay!  I'll pay it, but the Interstellar Trade Practices Commission might be interested in this. 
Everyone calms down. 
106     INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Melina watches from the bed as Quail dresses.  She rises, with only the sheet around her, tries desperately to make Quail stay.  Plainly he wants to, but he can't.  They kiss lingeringly;  then Quail, as if "called to duty," exits. 
WHITE LIGHT. 
108     INT. DETENTION CELL - WINDOWLESS 
Quail alone, hands bound, in a holding chamber.  Suddenly, the door opens and THREE BEEFY E.I.O. AGENTS enter.  They grab Quail to haul him out.  Quail battles them with amazing skill and resourcefulness.  With his bound hands he SLUGS ONE MAN, hurling him into a wall;  he RABBIT- PUNCHES a second man with a two-handed blow and KNOCKS HIM UNCONSCIOUS.  The third man sneaks around behind Quail and DROPS HIM WITH A BLACKJACK to the back of the head. 
WHITE LIGHT. 
109     INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - WINDOWLESS 
Quail on his back, all four limbs pinned by some futuristic version of "the rack," his head held imobile by a FEARSOME DEVICE similar to the one we glimpsed on Earth, in the van the two agents tried to shove him into. 
Several DOCTORS stand over him.  INTO FRAME moves... Cohaagen! 
Cohaagen orders the doctors to attach electrodes to PROBES already inserted into Quail's brain.  As they turn up the power, Quail's face contorts in a grimace of agony -- 
ORACLE HEAD'S VOICE You have seen your past. Now read the future... 
WHITE LIGHT. 
110     INT. SURREAL TUNNEL - DAY OR NIGHT 
The same scene we saw during the film's OPENING SEQUENCE. 
A man wearing a LIGHT-WEIGHT THERMAL SUIT races through a LABYRINTH OF TUNNELS.  The GROUND TREMBLES beneath him, as if in an earthquake.  EXPLOSIONS rumble deep in the ground below him.  Suddenly we realize -- the man is Quail 
INSERT - CLOSE - QUAIL 
He throws a backward glance over his shoulder, fearfully, as he runs.  Suddenly a BRILLIANT WHITE LIGHT floods in from ahead of him;  he puts up his hands to protect his eyes -- and sees his hands are SPLATTERED WITH BLOOD! 
Quail runs even faster -- ahead the BRILLIANT LIGHT seems to promise safety.  He battles toward it.  SOUNDS OF EXPLOSIONS increase, building urgency.  Up ahead, emerging from the light, HANDS REACH OUT TO HELP QUAIL.  He seems almost to safety.  But just as he REACHES THE HANDS -- 
TWO GUNSHOTS RING OUT! 
SHOCK CUT TO: 
111     INT. KUATO'S INNER SANCTUM - NIGHT 
Quail awakens with a jolt.  White as a sheet... sweating like he's just run ten miles.  Then:  a transformation seems to come over him.  He LOOKS -- and SEES: 
KUATO slumped across the cushions -- MELINA beside Kuato -- BENNIE standing holding a smoking GUN trained on Kuato. 
MELINA (rushes to Quail) Charles!  Are you all right? 
Quail stares at her, as if an entire bank of lost memories were suddenly clicking back into place -- 
MELINA (continuing) He kept dragging you deeper and deeper into the trance! We couldn't wake either of you! 
BENNIE You stopped breathing! 
Quail gives Bennie that same eerie look, then turns to Kuato, who is sprawled motionless across the pillows, a curl of smoke rising from two entry wounds in his spine. 
QUAIL Why did you kill him?  It was the next bit I really... 
BENNIE No choice, boss.  It was him or you. 
Quail lunges across the pillows to Kuato's unbreathing form.  Quail shakes the ancient mystic, trying to find a last flicker of life. 
MELINA What are we doing, Charles? For God's sake, tell us. 
QUAIL The Sphinx... it's not some useless artifact, it's a machine built by some alien race eighteen millions years ago.  The same race that built the on one Earth... for the same purpose. 
He stops in front of a large, odd-shaped vehicle with a large scoop or propeller on the front. 
QUAIL (continuing) This is what we need. 
He begins to climb in;  the others follow. 
BENNIE (referring to the Sphinx) It's a hunk of old stone, man. 
MELINA (ditto) Purpose?  What purpose? 
Bennie starts the engine. 
QUAIL Come on, Bennie, move it. (then, to Melina) Have you heard the word, "terriform"? 
Melina shakes her head.  The vehicle moves off. 
115A    EXT. AIR LOCK - MORNING 
GUARDS are carefully checking every vehicle leaving the city, though this has to be done fairly rapidly because of the inhabitants leaving for the Space Ports. 
The vehicle with Bennie, Quail and Melina arrives. 
115B    INT. VEHICLE - AIR LOCK - MORNING 
Bennie is nervous.  Melina and Quail are in the back, but cannot be seen.  Guards are checking all vehicles exiting, looking for Quail and Melina. 
BENNIE (calling to Guards) Just deliverin' some old junk to the mine out at Apidalia Planitia.  Got them people you're lookin' for in the back as well. 
The Guards laugh and signal him on. 
Once through the second door of the air lock (i.e. to the area outside the city), Quail and Melina emerge and sit up on the rear seats. 
QUAIL The machine in the Sphinx is tapped straight down to the molten core of this planet. There are tunnels and ducts everywhere, all powered by fusion generators... 
BENNIE You sure the little man didn't fry your brain, Quail? 
MELINA (overlapping) For what?  To do what? 
QUAIL To combine elements in the Martian core and release them as oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen. 
BENNIE That's air! 
116B    EXT. DESERT - MORNING 
In a wide shot, the vehicle is traversing the desert.  The domed city is some distance in the background.  Voices are heard in false perspective.  Emphasis is on the dry and hostile natural landscape of Mars. 
QUAIL That's right.  Air and water. Terriforming will create a permanent livable environment for Mars.  No more pressurized cities, no more containers in the desert.  There'll be rivers, vegetation - life - the same as Earth. 
MELINA (baffled) So why is Cohaagen shipping everyone out? 
QUAIL Don't you see?!  From being a pile of red dirt with minerals, Mars is going to change into  a chunk of priceless real estate. 
MELINA And Cohaagen's going to own it all! 
QUAIL Right!  He can start selling it off to well-heeled investors from Earth.  Beach condos, ski resorts, you name it. 
MELINA No wonder he wanted you to... penetrate... out group. 
Simultaneously, the air in the vehicle starts rushing out! All three parties begin choking.  As Bennie's mechanical hand claws for the lever that seals the vent, Quail has a moment to jump him.  He pounds Bennie's gun hand, the PISTOL IS SUCKED, CLATTERING, OUT THE VENT! 
Quail delivers a roundhouse punch to Bennie, knocking him clear across the bus. 
Melina seals the vent, REPRESSURIZES THE CABIN. 
Bennie gets up off the floor, shaking off Quail's punch-- 
121     EXT. DESERT - DAY 
The E.I.O. vehicle are a half mile off -- and closing in. 
122     INT. SAND MOLE - DAY 
Quail glances at the vehicles, turns to Bennie -- ready to jump him.  But stops short at what he sees Bennie doing. 
Bennie is clipping on his MECHANICAL ARM.  It sprouts several rows of vicious-looking STEEL BLADES -- 
BENNIE This makes Bennie a cut above anyone else. 
Bennie presses another button and the BLADES START SPINNING. Bennie's mechanical arm is in effect now a BUZZ SAW! 
The fight begins.  Bennie attacks Quail with his buzz-saw arm;  Quail dodges.  Bennie's arm shreds various articles in the cabin -- and keeps Melina at bay with well-timed swipes.  Finally Bennie gets in a roundhouse punch to Quail's jaw with his real hand.  Quail sprawls, dazed. 
Now Bennie goes for the kill.  But Melina leaps onto him. Bennie grabs her by the hair and moves his SPINNING HAND in for the quick kill.  Melina clutches the terrifying appendage with both hands, desperately keeping it at bay. But her strength is no match for Bennie; the whirring blades are just about to bite into Melina's neck when -- 
Quail comes back, lands a ferocious rabbit punch to Bennie's spine.  Quail lunges at him, grabs the blade weapon;  he and Bennie crash into the cabin wall and -- 
The BLADE RIPS CLEAR THROUGH THE MOLE'S WALL!  Alarms sound as a GAPING HOLE IS BLOWN IN THE SIDE OF THE CABIN!  ALL THE AIR IS SUCKED OUT BY MARS'S EXTERNAL VACUUM! 
Now no one can breathe.  They all claw for their masks, [still] in place.  Bennie is first;  he recovers, lunges with his SPINNING ARM for Quail.  Quail barely dodges, grabs the arm, muscles it back toward Bennie -- 
The SPINNING BLADES SEVER BENNIE'S OWN OXYGEN LINE!  Gasp- ing, he falters.  Quail aims a titanic blow, PUNCHES BENNIE out through the hole in the mole's wall! 
Quail and Melina, masks on, stare out as Bennie claws desperately at his severed air line.  The Martian vacuum pulls the oxygen from Bennie's lungs, he chokes, staggers -- 
122AA   EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Bennie is beside the vehicle.  He implodes like a balloon with all its air gone. 
122AB   INT/EXT. VEHICLE - DAY 
Melina hides her face in horror.  At that instant -- 
122A    EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Bullets dig into the sand all around the vehicle.  The patrol cars are only a few hundred yards away!  Loud- speakers call for Quail's surrender. 
122B    INT. VEHICLE - DAY 
Quail lunges for the vehicle controls.  Presses a button marked "Dive".  The vehicle tilts. 
122C    EXT. DESERT - DAY 
The vehicle burrows powerfully into the sand.  As the patrol cars close in and rake the desert with gunfire, the vehicle vanishes from sight.  In the distance, the Sphinx looms ominously. 
A driver in one of the patrol vehicles (filmed from outside the windscreen) is speaking into a microphone.  He can't be heard but can only be radioing a report. 
123     INT. SAND MOLE - MOVING - UNDERGROUND 
The little mining vehicle moves powerfully, propelled by its BORER NOSE. 
We HEAR the FOOTSTEPS of the seven guards recede. 
The two remaining guards realize their isolation; they glance tensely to one another. 
GUARD #1 Did you hear something? 
GUARD #2 No.  Where? 
GUARD #1 Over there. 
The First Guard points to the edge  of the main shaft -- right where Quail and Melina are hiding.  The Guards cock their weapons, start cautiously forward.  Just as they're about to peer over the brink, guns at the ready: 
QUAIL'S VOICE (O.S.) (from behind the guards) I'm not there, boys.  I'm here. 
The guards spin around, weapons poised.  Standing in the shadows, near the corridor, is Quail!  (Still with no gun) 
Both guards walk quickly toward Quail, covering him with their weapons. 
GUARD #1 (to Guard #2) Watch him.  He was EIO trained. They're all full of tricks. 
GUARD #2 Yeah?  Like...who was that guy? -- Fred Bond?? (to Quail) Keep 'em up, Fred, keep 'em up. 
Quail has his arms raised high.  Just as the Guards reach him, he fizzes electronically, emitting a humming sound, then disappears. 
GUARD #1 A hologram! 
Before either Guard can react, the real Quail appears -- one foot behind them.  With two LIGHTNING BLOWS, he dispatches the Guards.  (Apparently Quail has climbed out of the shaft while the Guards were distracted.) 
Quail snatches both Guards' weapons, grenades and ammo belts.  Melina climbs out of the shaft.  Quail tosses her one of the Guard's guns. 
130     INT. CORRIDOR - LEVEL ONE 
ALARMS go off everywhere.  Quail -- carrying a gun and all the grenades and ammo belts -- and Melina (just carrying a gun) bolt down a corridor past a sign: "LEVEL ONE". 
MELINA (running) Where'd you get that little trick? 
QUAIL (running) Mail-order company.  It's a great one for fooling the wife. 
131     INT. CONTROL ROOM (LEVEL THIRTEEN) 
Cohaagen and his Aides hear the ALARMS, see Quail and Melina on MONITORS as they race down the corridor on Level One. 
COHAAGEN How the hell did they get in? 
SECURITY AIDE Up the fusion core. 
COHAAGEN Up the fusion core?? 
He exhibits begrudging admiration for Quail. 
SECURITY AIDE (studies monitor more carefully) They're on Level One. 
A wall sign behind Cohaagen reads:  "LEVEL THIRTEEN". 
COHAAGEN Seal all upper levels. 
A button is pressed and huge doors slide across in front of the formidable doors already closing the Control Room off from the outside corridors. 
133     INT. LEVEL ONE CORRIDOR 
Quail and Melina are still racing through the corridors. He passes her a fresh ammo belt. 
Quail and Melina traverse across the cheekbones, haul themselves up at the base of the red translucent eyes -- 
142A    INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY 
The video monitors show the space shuttles.  An operator, with earphones, turns to Cohaagen. 
OPERATOR First of the shuttles ready for departure, sir.  Two minute countdown. 
142B    EXT. SPHINX - DAY 
Quail jams THREE GRENADES against the glass of the eyes, pulls Melina back behind the stone cheeks -- 
143     INT. SPHINX CONTROL ROOM 
A MUFFLED EXPLOSION (due to the thin Martian atmosphere) detonates overhead.  THE SPHINX'S RIGHT EYE BLOWS IN a storm of shards and shrapnell. 
Instantly, the room turns into a hurricane as the Martian vacuum sucks out all air!  Everyone panics, grabbing their 
COHAAGEN Seal the breach!  Repressurize! 
An aide dives for an EMERGENCY SWITCH.  But now -- 
Quail and Melina, wearing breather masks, bursts in onto an overhead catwalk.  They OPEN FIRE on the Guards, who are choking, struggling with their masks. 
An EMERGENCY PRESSURE SEAL powers into place, sealing the breach in the eye.  REPRESSURIZATION comes up, the internal atmosphere stabilizes -- 
None of the men inside the control room still moves.  The victors tug off their masks, spring down to the main level. Melina hurries to the main control panel. 
Melina looks towards the video monitors showing half a dozen huge space shuttles lined up for departure. 
MELINA Those shuttles are starting up any minute.  If you know how to work this thing, you better do it now. 
Quail tentatively approaches the imposingly complex machinery. 
QUAIL Yes... 
He hesitates. 
MELINA Don't you know how? 
Transfixed, mesmerized, Quail moves closer to the control panel. 
QUAIL Yes... there's a vital connection missing... 
He approaches even closer.  He begins to raise his arm towards a blank area a little above his head. 
QUAIL (continuing) ...me... 
COHAAGEN Wait! 
MELINA Don't wait! 
COHAAGEN If you activate the mechanism you'll die...there were glimpses of it in your memory. 
QUAIL Wrong, Cohaagen, there's a long tunnel, a brilliant white light, hands reaching for me... 
COHAAGEN (assured) That's your death.  That's what it looks like.  That's what is always looks like. 
Quail looks around him, half-convinced. 
MELINA (looking toward space shuttles on video screens) Charles - for Mars's sake....

OVER A BLACI: SCREEN: Crickets chirp in the night. A DOORBELL rings. Sheets rustle... A BEDSIDE LAMP is turned on. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
NORMA LEWIS ( 31) sits up in bed. The soft glow of the lamp casts her in silhouette. Her husband, ARTHUR LEWIS (30), lies next to her. 
NORMA Did you hear something? 
ARTHUR The doorbell. 
NORMA Are you sure that was the doorbell? From down below... the DOORBELL rings again. 
ARTHUR Yep. Norma retrieves her WATCH from the bedside table. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) What time is it? 
NORMA Quarter 'til five. Norma gets out of bed and throws on her bathrobe. Arthur sits up, hair sticking up in every direction. He has sideburns that run down the side of his face like daggers. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT 
Norma comes down the stairs and approaches the front door. She looks through the PEEPHOLE. Through the PEEPHOLE... she glimpses a BLACK SEDAN idling in the street. It quickly drives off. Norma unlatches the DEAD BOLT and opens the door. She notices something at her feet. 
Someone has left a CARDBOARD BOX on the front step. It's dimensions are 1' x 1' x 1' She leans down and picks up the box, noticing that it has been meticulously sealed with clear tape. There are no markings on it whatsoever. Norma looks down the quiet, empty street. She quickly closes the door and turns inside and away from the cold air. Arthur arrives at the bottom of the stairs. 
ARTHUR What is it? 
NORMA Someone left a box. 
ARTHUR Who? 
NORMA I don't know. There was a car waiting... but they drove off. Norma hands the box to Arthur. He examines it. 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) Is that one of my Christmas presents? Their young son, WALTER LEWIS ( 9), is standing at the top of the stairs. He is dressed in his pajamas. His parents just stare back at him in silence. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
The Lewis family has now moved into the kitchen. WRAPPING PAPER and CHRISTMAS ORNAMENTS are scattered across the table. Norma is pouring COFFEE. Arthur is cutting through the tape that seals the box with a knife while Walter looks on eagerly. 
WALTER Should I close my eyes? 
ARTHUR Maybe... it's up to you. Arthur opens the lid and sees that there are FOAM PEANUTS inside. He digs down and retrieves a WOODEN BOX. Its dimensions are 8" x 8" x 8". 
The box is made of WHITE OAK with a clear varnish. Mounted on top is a CLEAR GLASS DOME attached to a lid with a HINGE MOUNT. Inside of the dome is a CYLINDRICAL METAL BUTTON. 
NORMA Is there a note? Arthur reaches inside the box and retrieves a small WHITE ENVELOPE. Printed on the envelope in CALLIGRAPHY is the name: 
MRS. LEWIS 
ARTHUR It's for you, Norma. Norma opens the envelope and removes a folded piece of white stationary. Printed in elegant calligraphy is a single sentence: 
MR. STEWARD WILL CALL UPON YOU AT 5:00 PM. 
NORMA Dana... you're baby-sitting for us tonight, right? 
DANA Eight o'clock? 
NORMA Eight o'clock. 
DANA Okay. Dana gets on the bus. BUD WALL (30s), the bus driver, smiles at Norma. He is an enormous giant of a man with a shaved head. 
NORMA Bus-Driver Bud! Merry Christmas... 
BUD Our last day! 
NORMAL I know! 
BUD It'll all be over soon, Norma. He stares at her for a moment that is almost too long... then shuts the doors to the bus. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arthur sits at the table... reading the morning paper. The CAMERA zooms into the COMICS SECTION... revealing the panels of the comic strip REX MORGAN, MD. Arthur begins reading the voices of REX MORGAN and his girlfriend JUNE. 
ARTHUR (as Rex Morgan) Do you realize that this is the first time in my life that I will be taking more than a week's vacation, June? Norma arrives in the kitchen. She now has a slight limp. 
ARTHUR (CONT-D) (as June, hi-pitched) And enjoy it! Don't worry about the office! 
NORMA Rex Morgan... I need you back here no later than seven. Rehearsal dinner starts at eight. Arthur grabs his BRIEFCASE and a BASKETBALL. 
ARTHUR The Viking Squad has a game at four. 
NORMA Don't get stuck in Friday traffic... 
ARTHUR Okay June. He starts bouncing the ball on the kitchen floor. She grabs the ball in mid bounce... annoyed with him. 
NORMA Not in the house! 
ARTHUR How's your foot? 
NORMA It's fine. She pushes him toward into the FAMILY ROOM... opening the door that leads out to the garage. They exit the house and the CAMERA drifts back toward the kitchen table... moving in toward the box. 
EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER 
The GARAGE DOOR opens and both of the LEWIS FAMILY CARS back out at the same time, almost choreographed in perfect unison. Arthur drives a SILVER 1975 PONTIAC TRANS-AM. Norma drives a WHITE 1976 OLDSMOBILE STATION WAGON with WOOD WALLS. They pull out onto MONUMENT AVENUE, cars pointing in opposite directions. Arthur rolls down his window. 
ARTHUR It's your Christmas present. 
NORMA From you? 
B. 
ARTHUR From your secret lover. 
(BEAT) Mr. Steward. She furrows her brow. 
NORMA 
(SARCASTIC) I hate you, Rex Morgan MD. 
ARTHUR 
(PLAYFUL) I hate you, too. 
NORMA Don't be late tonight. 
ARTHUR I've got your present at work. It's almost finished. He smiles... then peels off down Monument Ave. From Norma's REAR VIEW MIRROR... Arthur's car disappears down the road. She reaches up to re-adjust... her eyes appear in the mirror's reflection. INSERT: Norma's VIRGINIA license plate. The Oldsmobile drives down the street in the opposite direction. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN RICHMOND -- MORNING 
HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA crests over the barren WINTER FOREST on the southeast side of the city... tipping up to reveal DOWNTOWN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA. 
MALE STUDENT #1 Yes! Norma sets an OWL PELLET down in front of a FEMALE STUDENT ( 12). She looks at the owl pellet in disgust. 
FEMALE STUDENT #1 This is so gross. Norma sets a tray down in front of Charles. 
CHARLES Why do they call it an owl pellet? A MALE STUDENT ( 12) next to him takes his tray from Norma. 
MALE STUDENT #2 Because they shit out of their mouths. 
NORMA Hey... watch the language. You say another cuss word I've gotta send you to detention, okay? 
MALE STUDENT #2 Sorry, Mrs. Lewis. 
FEMALE STUDENT #1 Is it true? 
NORMA Is what true? 
FEMALE STUDENT #1 That owls poo out of their mouths. 
NORMA Yes... this is true. The classroom gasps in disgust... others laugh. 
NORMA (CONT-D) Grey forest owls feed upon field mice, squirrels and small birds. The owl will then regurgitate the bones and waste matter in a ball of black mucous. Inside this mucous you will likely find the entire skeleton of its prey. Norma goes to the front of the room and lowers a SCREEN. 
NORMA (CONT-D) I'm going to show you a film about the digestive process of the owl, and how the owl pellet is formed. The classroom whispers with excitement. 
EXT. NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER -- ENTRANCE GATE -- MORNING 
Arthur pulls through the ENTRANCE GATE at the NASA LANGLEY RESEARCH CENTER. He retrieves his BADGE from the dashboard and shows it to the guard. 
EXT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN STREET -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arthur's car drives down MAIN STREET on the campus of the research center. The buildings are predominately drab, functional, one story brick structures.. surrounded by various GLOBE STRUCTURES and PIPE NETWORKS on manicured green lawns. 
INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CORRIDOR -- MOMENTS LATER 
The CAMERA tracks with Arthur as he moves through the crowded corridor of one of the research buildings. He says hello to various colleagues along the way. All of the men at the facility are dressed the same... with white shirts and TIES and POCKET PROTECTOR BADGES. The place resembles an all-male community college for young scientists. 
INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MEDIA ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arthur eases his way into the small, crowded AUDITORIUM that serves as a MEDIA ROOM. A PRESS CONFERENCE is underway. NORM CAHILL ( 40s), the VIKING PROJECT COORDINATOR, is standing at the podium. Next to him is an OVERHEAD PROJECTOR with maps and various schematics projected from it onto a 
LARGE SCREEN. 
REPORTER #1 It's been five months since the Viking lander touched down on the surface of Mars. We've seen dozens of photographs of the rock covered surface... what can you now tell us about the tests you've been conducting? Is there any sign of life on the red planet? Arthur takes a seat in the back of the auditorium. 
CAHILL Well... there are three separate tests that we've been conducting... Pyrolytic Release, Labeled Release and Gas Exchange. The first two tests, based on soil samples about 22 centimeters deep, came back negative... and the third is... still pending. Cahill smiles. Laughter erupts from various parts of the auditorium. 
REPORTER #1 Can you elaborate on test number three? Cahill places a transparent MAP of the mars surface on the overhead projector and begins to draw on it with a WAX 
PENCIL. 
CAHILL The gas exchange experiment measures the production or uptake of C02, nitrogen, methane, hydrogen, and oxygen during the incubation of the martian soil sample. 
REPORTER #2 Are you showing us all of the photos? Are there little green men up there? Laughter from the press. 
CAHILL Well... there is a possibility that the planet abounds with chemical compounds produced by living systems. Their chemical nature, distribution and structural uniqueness could be used to argue the presence of microscopic living organisms on Mars. As Cahill moves on to the next question... Arthur taps the reporter on the shoulder. 
ARTHUR It all comes down to water. Arthur points to an OVERHEAD SATELLITE PHOTO of Utopia Planitia, a raised level of martian terrain in the vicinity of the site where VIKING II landed. There are dry river-bed formations in the soil. 
ARTHUR (CONT-D) If we find water beneath the surface... and the topographic maps of Utopia Planitia indicate that there were once rivers on the surface of the planet, it's possible that we'll eventually find evidence of life. 
INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- MOMENTS LATER 
The OWL PELLET FILM is underway. Norma sits in the back of the class next to the projector. She crosses her legs... reaching for her foot... massaging it gently. She cringes... clearly in intense pain. Charles looks back at her... noticing this. They make eye contact... and Charles turns back to the screen. 
INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- CAHILL'S OFFICE -- MORNING 
Arthur now sits across from Cahill in his office. Behind him is a window that overlooks a huge laboratory. 
Arthur discards... then retrieves a replacement card from the stack. 
ARTHUR So this dumb-ass Richmond doctor takes the x-ray... then he goes to check on another patient down the hall. Arthur discards a king. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) This dumb--ass... he left the x-ray machine on. 
WENDELL Jesus. That's not good. 
INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- NEXT 
Norma raises up her right shoe to show the class. 
NORMA They found out that the tissue in four of my toes had been completely 
I destroyed by the radiation. Norma swivels around on the desk and places her right foot against her left inner thigh. 
NORMA (CONT'D) So they have to amputate four of my toes. And then they had to take a bunch of skin from my inner thigh to cover the front of my foot. This is back in 1963... so they didn't have the skin graft techniques they do now. 
INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- NEXT 
Arthur stands up and takes his RIGHT FOOT... pulls it up and touches it to his LEFT INNER THIGH. 
ARTHUR She had to sit there in a hospital bed in the same position for six months, waiting for it to heal. Wendell stares at the mold on the laboratory table. 
WENDELL Jesus. I hope she sued this idiot. 
ARTHUR Oh yeah. Her family sued. They won. 
WENDELL What was the settlement? 
ARTHUR Forty thousand dollars. Arthur pulls the ceramic mold out of the pink goop... and we see the IMPRESSION of her disfigured foot inside the new 
PROSTHESIS. 
INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- SCIENCE LAB -- NEXT 
Norma turns around and uncrosses her legs. They now dangle over the edge of the lab desk. 
NORMA You guys want to see it? Now that the secret is out... I don't want you spreading rumors about my mangled foot. The class responds enthusiastically. 
NORMA (CONT'D) Come on... gather round... take a look at the freak show. As the kids gather around... Norma removes her right shoe and reveals her disfigured foot... missing every toe but her pinky. A rounded piece of SCAR TISSUE covers the rest of it. 
INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- NEXT 
Arthur takes the trimmed PROSTHESIS and wraps it in tissue paper, then places it in a CARDBOARD BOX with a red bow on it. 
ARTHUR If this sucker works... she can, start jogging again. 
INT. COLLEGIATE SCHOOL -- HALLWAY -- MIDDAY 
Dana walks up to Walter as he stands in front of his locker. 
DANA I'm sorry I said that her foot looked gross. 
WALTER It doesn't look gross... it looks cool. And if you can't tell the difference between gross and cool... then I feel sorry for you, Dana. Walter walks off... leaving her alone. 
EXT. LEWIS HOUSE -- AFTERNOON 
Norma emerges from her car carrying GROCERY BAGS in both arms. Walter comes out of the garage with his bike. 
NORMA Hey honey. 
WALTER Why do I need a baby-sitter? 
NORMA Because you're nine years old. You're not a geezer yet. 
WALTER It's 1976, mom. Times are changing. Nine years old isn't what it used to be. I think I'm ready to get a moped. 
ARLINGTON (CONT'D) Then, you will receive a payment of two-hundred thousand dollars... tax free. Arlington opens the briefcase. Inside are neatly stacked rows of ONE-HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. 
ARLINGTON (CONT'D) The money will be delivered to you in cash. Norma covers her mouth... shocked at the sight of so much money. 
NORMA Are you for real? Arlington smiles back at her. 
ARLINGTON Mrs. Lewis, I can assure you that the offer is real. 
NORMA Who do you work for? 
ARLINGTON The guarantee of payment has several restrictions. One... I am not permitted to disclose any information about to the identity of my employers. 
(BEAT) Two... if you discuss the details of this financial opportunity with anyone other than your husband, the offer is null and void, and you will not receive the money in return for having pushed the button. 
(BEAT) Three... you have twenty four hours. Arlington glances at his watch. 
ARLINGTON (CONT'D) You have until five o'clock tomorrow evening to make your decision whether or not to push the button. At that time, I will return to retrieve the button unit from you. It will be re-programmed and the offer will be made to someone else. Arlington places the key back into the envelope, seals it with crisp precision, and hands it over to her. He then closes the briefcase and stands up to leave. 
ARLINGTON (CONT'D) Until then... a good day to you, Mrs. Lewis. He nods his head and turns toward the foyer. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FOYER -- NEXT 
She follows him toward the front door. 
NORMA Wait a minute... you're just going to leave me with this thing. 
(BAFFLED) Is this some kind of joke? Who are you? He opens the front door and turns back to her with a friendly smile. 
ARLINGTON My name is Arlington Steward, and I can assure you that this is no joke. The offer is real, but I am not at liberty to disclose any more information than I already have. He withdraws a BUSINESS CARD and hands it to her. 
ARLINGTON (CONT'D) Good day. He heads down the walk toward his car. She looks down at the card and sees that his name is printed in an embossed BLACK FONT: 
ARLINGTON STEWARD 
She turns the card over and sees what looks like a PHONE NUMBER printed on the back: 
She stands there in the doorway and watches him step into the automobile, start the engine and drive off. 
EXT. CARYTOWN SHOPPING CENTER -- AFTERNOON 
Walter is sitting on a bench in front of a line of shops in CARYTOWN. Dana approaches him. He turns to face her. 
WALTER What do you want? 
DANA I'm sorry. I just wanted to tell you... that I think your mom is beautiful. Walter just stares at her in silence... wanting to forgive her. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT 
Norma walks back into the kitchen, holding the key envelope in one hand and the business card in the other. She stares at them both, then down at the box. She then retrieves the key from the envelope and inserts it into the slot, opening the glass dome. She stares at the button for a long moment... then closes the dome. She closes her eyes... trying to make sense of what has just transpired. 
INT. BURNS HOUSE -- NEXT 
The CAMERA zooms out from a RINGING PHONE that sits on a KITCHEN COUNTER in a large suburban house. SUSAN BURNS (50s) goes to answer the phone. 
SUSAN Hello? 
NORMA (PHONE) Hey mom. 
SUSAN Hey honey. What's up? 
NORMA (PHONE) Nothing... I just... The CAMERA continues to zoom out, revealing her husband, JIM BURNS (50s) laid out in a recliner, watching television. 
SUSAN Is something wrong? 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT 
Norma stares at the business card. 
ARTHUR Yeah... what's it all about. Did he show up? 
NORMA Yeah... I'll tell you about it in the car. We're running late. Norma leans down and kisses Walter on the cheek. 
NORMA (CONT'D) We'll be home late... your bedtime is ten. Dana watches them go... her eyes transfixed on the box in Norma's hands. 
EXT. RIVER ROAD -- NIGHT 
The CAMERA tracks with Arthur's car as it drives south on CARY STREET... approaching an intersection. 
INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT 
Norma has the box sitting in her lap while Arthur drives. 
NORMA And before I could ask him anything else... he got in his car... and he pulled off. 
ARTHUR Did you get the license plate? 
NORMA No. 
ARTHUR Your dad is cop, Norma. Always get the license plate number. 
NORMA I was little overwhelmed, Arthur. 
ARTHUR Somewhere in the world... someone you do not know will die. 
NORMA Those were his exact words. 
ARTHUR Did he say how they would die? 
NORMA No. 
ARTHUR And he showed you the cash. 
NORMA Yeah. He said it was two-hundred thousand. It looked real to me. 
ARTHUR What did he look like? 
NORMA You don't want to know. I think he's a burn victim. Poor thing... half of his face is gone. 
ARTHUR Really? 
NORMA I think maybe he's a life insurance salesman. Maybe that's what it is. It's some kind of survey. We push the button and he offers us a discount on a two-hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy. Joke's on us. 
EXT. COUNTRY CLUB OF VIRGINIA -- NIGHT 
The CAMERA descends upon the COUNTRY CLUB OF VIRGINIA. It is a MASSIVE COLONIAL MANSION that sits upon a huge hill that is littered with CHRISTMAS LUMINARIES that glow in the night. 
EXT. C.C.V. -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT 
We approach Arthur's car as they pull into a PARKING SPACE in front of the main entrance. 
INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT 
Arthur grabs the box from off her lap. 
ARTHUR Did you bring the key with you? She hands it to him. He takes the key and inserts it... opening the glass dome. He then takes his INDEX FINGER and places it on the button. 
NORMA What the hell are you doing?! 
ARTHUR 
(PLAYFUL) I was gonna push the button. 
NORMA No! 
Norma reaches over and snaps the dome closed. 
SUSAN They're all wearing them that way now, Bev. 
NATHAN BURNS ( 26), Norma's wheelchair-bound younger brother, comes rolling up. 
NATHAN Outer space? Is someone planning on departing the surface of the earth? 
ARTHUR Nathan! Arthur stands up and gives him a hug. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) It's been years. How have you been? 
NATHAN I've been better... I mean, I used to have legs... The table goes silent... Susan looks as though she might start to cry. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Sorry... morbid humor. What's this talk about outer space? 
NORMA Arthur has been working at Nasa. 
JIM He helped design the camera that photographed the Mars surface. Arthur puts his hands on the back of Nathan's wheelchair. 
ARTHUR Nathan and I are gonna go grab a drink... He begins to wheel Nathan toward the bar. 
NORMA Arthur made me a new prosthesis for my foot. Some space age formula... it's incredible. 
JIM Can he make Nathan a pair of prosthetic legs? 
INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- BAR -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arthur now sits with Nathan over by the bar. 
NATHAN Can you believe it? I survive eighteen months crawlling through the Vietnam jungle and not one bullet so much as grazes my body. 
(BEAT) And I come home, take a few tabs of LSD at a Grateful Dead show and wrap my car around a tree. Arthur doesn't know how to respond. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Pretty damn sad... losing the legs that way, but I always thought it was Karmic retribution for what I did to Norma. 
ARTHUR What'd you ever do to Norma? 
NATHAN I dropped that barbell on her foot when we were kids. That's why she went to get that x-ray. If it wasn't for me... she'd still have all her toes. 
ARTHUR You can't think of it that way. 
NATHAN Why not? It's the truth. 
ARTHUR You didn't leave the x-ray machine on, Dr. Stupid did. 
NATHAN Yeah, but my mistake sent her to Dr. Stupid... so that makes me culpable in the eyes of Buddha. 
ARTHUR You're no more culpable than the company that manufactured the barbell. Stop punishing yourself. Nathan smiles in appreciation and takes a long swig of Jack Daniels. 
NATHAN You know he's here. 
ARTHUR Who? 
NATHAN Dr. Stupid. Nathan nods his head across the room... where DR. EARL STUPE ( 50s) is seated at a table with his wife. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Dr. Earl Stupe. He's still got a practice over on the west end. Arthur looks over at him... for a moment they make brief eye contact... and Stupe quickly looks away. 
INT. C.C.V. -- GRAND BALLROOM -- NEXT 
Susan is now staring at Dr. Stupe. They are joined by DEBORAH BURNS (24), Norma's younger sister and bride-to-be. 
SUSAN I wonder if he even recognizes us. 
JIM I'm sure he does. 
DEBORAH I can't believe they still let him practice medicine. 
NORMA You gotta let it go. You gotta learn to forgive and forget. 
NORMA Two-hundred thousand dollars is a lot of money, Arthur. 
ARTHUR What would we do with that kind of money? 
NORMA We could get out of Richmond... move to California. 
ARTHUR Then we could cross the border into Mexico if they ever came after us. 
NORMA You can't arrest someone for pushing a button, Arthur. It's not a weapon. It's not a gun. We wouldn't be culpable... not in a court of law. 
ARTHUR What if it's someone's baby? 
NORMA What if it's some murderer on death row in China? 
ARTHUR What if it's our neighbor across the street. Do you know our neighbors across the street? Have you ever met them? 
NORMA Yeah. Doug and Donna. 
ARTHUR Hmmm. I haven't met Doug or Donna. 
(BEAT) What does it mean to officially know someone, anyway? Do you know me, Norma? 
NORMA I know you better than you know yourself. 
ARTHUR Do you know Walter? 
NORMA Even better than I know you. They spin around on the dance floor. 
ARTHUR It's just a stupid prank, Norma. 
NORMA Life insurance. Arthur gazes across the ballroom toward the bar. Nathan sits there alone... finishing his drink. 
EXT. C.C.V. -- PARKING LOT --LATER THAT NIGHT 
Arthur and Norma watch as Jim hoists Nathan up into their VAN with a HYDRAULIC LIFT. He is passed out drunk. Behind him... Dr. Stupe is waiting in line at the valet for his car. He and Norma make eye contact. His eyes dart down to the pavement as he steps into his car. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- FAMILY ROOM -- LATER ON 
Norma and Arthur come into the family room. Dana is asleep on the couch. Norma sets the box down on the coffee table and goes to wake Dana. 
NORMA Dana... Dana's eyes slowly open. 
NORMA (CONT'D) Arthur will drive you home, okay? 
DANA I have my bike... and my house isn't far from here. 
NORMA Where's Walter? 
DANA He's asleep upstairs. Arthur hands Dana a ten dollar bill. 
ARTHUR Are you sure you don't need a ride? 
DANA I'm sure. 
ARTHUR Good night, Dana. Dana exits through the front door. Norma stands up and moves toward the foyer. 
NORMA Can you turn off the Christmas tree lights? 
ARTHUR I like leaving them on. 
NORMA It's a fire hazard. 
ARTHUR It keeps the Christmas spirit alive while we sleep. 
NORMA We could die. 
ARTHUR Everyone dies eventually, Norma. She stares at the tree. 
Arthur and Norma drive toward downtown. 
NORMA There was owl... in our back yard. 
ARTHUR An owl? 
NORMA He said it was his owl. 
ARTHUR Are you hiding anything else from me, Norma? 
NORMA 
(DEFENSIVE) No. 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- NEXT 
The CAMERA tracks with Arthur and Norma as they move through the vast space of the RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY. They arrive at the ADULT FICTION section... and the CAMERA moves along the spines of various books until it arrives at the one with the call number: F2988.34 Norma removes a BOOK from the shelf and looks at the cover: 
NO EXIT 
JEAN-PAUL SARTRE Norma shows it to Arthur. 
NORMA No exit. 
ARTHUR 
(MIS-PRONOUNCES) Sartre. 
NORMA it's pronounced Sartre. Jean-Paul Sartre. The French existentialist. She begins to thumb through the pages of the play. 
ARTHUR Never read it. 
NORMA It's a play... I read it in high school. It's about three strangers who find themselves trapped in a room together for all of eternity. They've quickly discover that they've all been sent to hell. Norma turns back to the inside cover of the book. Someone has written in crisp penmanship: 
RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH 
SEPTEMBER 3, 1976 Norma runs her hand down the list of names on the library card. The name of the last person to check out the book is: 
STEWARD 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- CIRCULATION DESK -- NEXT 
Arthur and Norma approach the circulation desk. A female LIBRARIAN ( 70s) is standing there. 
NORMA Hi... we're looking for an archival Times-Dispatch from September of this year. She offers them a warm smile. 
LIBRARIAN Microfiche. 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- RECORDS ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arthur and Norma now sit in front of a MICROFICHE READER in a long line of wooden desks in the RECORDS ROOM. On the screen... HEADLINES from the year's newspapers scroll by... stopping on the headline for SEPTEMBER 3, 1976: 
MARS PHOTOS REVEALED 
VIKING LANDER SENDS FIRST IMAGES OF RED PLANET BACK TO EARTH 
ARTHUR Arlington Steward... I remember the name now. He used to work at 
NASA... 
INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- [FLASHBACK] 
Arthur and Wendell are standing among a large group of SCIENTISTS in the laboratory. Everyone is assembled... staring at a large BLANK SCREEN, waiting in anticipation. Cahill stands at the front of the group with a WALKIE-TALKIE to his ear. 
CAHILL Alright... the first photo should come down off the server in less than a minute. 
EXT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LUNAR LANDER MODULE -- NEXT 
JIM Our fugitive is named Robert Bevilacqua. He shot and killed his wife at their residence on Cary Street earlier today. We believe that he escaped on foot... and could be armed and dangerous. The CAMERA moves across a line of POLICE OFFICERS... listening... 
JIM (CONT'D) Mr. Bevilacqua is an employee at NASA... and he is a former Marine who served in Vietnam. He may very well be armed and dangerous... 
INT. RICHMOND BAR -- NEXT 
The CAMERA tracks through a dingy RICHMOND DIVE BAR. Bevilacqua sits at the bar with a baseball cap pulled down low to conceal his face. He is drinking whiskey. Wendell James approaches... carrying a FILE under his arm. 
WENDELL Bevilacqua... Bevilacqua turns to face him. 
BEVILACQUA Wendell. They hug one another. 
INT. RICHMOND BAR -- MOMENTS LATER 
The two men are now sitting across from one another in a BOOTH. Wendell has a NASA BLUE-PRINT laid out on the table. The blue-print is of the button unit. 
BEVILACQUA You designed it? 
WENDELL Yeah. Cahill told me to... 
Bevilacaua notices a SMALL PURPLE STAIN on the blue-print. 
INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- LABORATORY -- [FLASHBACK] 
Cahill stands over Wendell's shoulder as he sits at a DRAFTING TABLE in the laboratory. 
WENDELL This what you were looking for, sir? Cahill looks stares at the blue-print... possessed. A DROP OF BLOOD falls from his right nostril and lands on it. 
CAHILL Yes. Thank you Wendell. 
INT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN HANGAR -- DAY 
The CAMERA moves through the MASSIVE MAIN HANGAR at Langley. There are several planes parked inside. Wendell emerges from behind one of the planes... watching from a hidden vantage point... Cahill stands at a work table with Arlington. There are THREE BUTTON UNITS laid out on the table. Arlington begins to place them inside a leather bag. Cahill then hands Arlington a FILE. 
CAHILL You're not gonna hurt these boys, are you? 
ARLINGTON Any harm that comes to them will be their own doing. Arlington takes the bag and moves toward the hangar entrance. 
EXT. NASA LANGLEY FACILITY -- MAIN HANGAR -- NEXT 
Outside... there is a MASSIVE CEMENT RUNWAY. Parked on the runway is Arlington's car. BUD WALL steps out and opens the door for his boss. Bus-Driver Bud is Steward's driver... Arlington steps inside. Wendell watches them drive off... 
INT. RICHMOND DIVE BAR -- EVENING 
Wendell then hands a file to Bevilacqua. Inside there is a dossier and photo of a ARTHUR LEWIS. He flips to another dossier and photo of another NASA EMPLOYEE named KENNETH 
WELLER. 
WENDELL There's a list... and they've all got a wife and one child. Bevilacqua thumbs through the list of NASA dossiers. He sees Arthur Lewis among them. 
WENDELL (CONT'D) Did you kill your wife? Bevilacqua just stares at him... on the verge of tears. He slides an ENVELOPE across the table. 
BEVILACQUA This is a confession letter that I wrote... it explains everything that happened with Steward and the box. Keep it... cause if I don't make it... this might clear my name one day. Bevilacqua looks at the KENNETH WELLER dossier. 
BEVILACQUA (CONT'D) This guy Weller is gonna be next. Did you get their phone number? 
WENDELL No. They're not listed. Just an old address south of Petersburg. What are you gonna do? 
BEVILACQUA I don't know. I need a car. I might be able to save them... and this guy Arthur Lewis... Wendell thinks to himself... then retrieves a set of KEYS from his pocket. 
WENDELL These are the keys to my cousin's pick-up truck. It's not registered. It's parked in front of my house over on Byrd street. Take it... 
BEVILACQUA Thank you, Wendell. 
INT. RICHMOND POLICE STATION -- BURNS'S OFFICE -- LATER 
Burns sits behind his desk... telephone to his ear. 
ARTHUR I'm not gonna touch you, lady. 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- PERIODICALS SECTION -- NEXT 
Arlington now stares directly into Norma's soul. The scar tissue on the left side of his face does not move when he smiles. It remains frozen... unable to express emotion. 
ARLINGTON And what emotion did you feel when you first laid eyes upon me, Norma? She thinks silently for a moment. 
NORMA I felt.. . She stops herself... afraid of how he might respond if she is honest with him. 
ARLINGTON You felt what? 
NORMA I felt... 
ARLINGTON Pity? 
NORMA Love. 
ARLINGTON You felt love for me? 
NORMA Yes. 
ARLINGTON Why? 
NORMA Because of my foot. Because of my disfigurement. I thought of all the pain I've felt in my life because of it... the physical pain... the emotional pain. 
(BEAT) 
(MORE) 
NORMA (CONT'D) I thought about what it would be like to have that pain magnified and projected onto my face... onto a part of my body that I can't hide with a shoe. There are tears welling in her eyes. 
NORMA (CONT`D) I saw all of that pain in your face and I understood it... and I felt an overwhelming feeling of love for you because I knew I'd never feel sorry for myself or my goddamn foot ever again. 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- RECORDS ROOM -- NEXT 
Elizabeth continues to hold her hand out toward Arthur. 
ELIZABETH Take my hand, son. 
ARTHUR You called me a cuckold. You made a statement... made an implication to me that my wife was going to be killed. 
(BEAT) So please understand why I might be reluctant to take your hand. 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- PERIODICALS SECTION -- NEXT 
Arlington reaches his hand out to Norma. 
ARLINGTON Take my hand, Norma... She stares at him, unable to move... then takes his hand... 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- RECORDS ROOM -- NEXT 
Elizabeth reaches out and grabs Arthur's hand against his will. His body convulses at her touch... The CAMERA drifts in toward Arthur's face as his eyes slowly close. Her spell has been cast upon him... 
CUT TO BLACK: 
SILENCE. 
INT. DREAM -- CORRIDOR -- NEXT 
The CAMERA moves slowly down a CORRIDOR. The floor is shiny white marble and the walls are framed by ornate molding and 
RENAISSANCE ART. Arlington stands at the end of the corridor. He is wearing a TUXEDO, portraying the VALET character from Sartre's No Exit. The CAMERA pans around to reveal Arthur... walking slowly down the corridor. Arlington opens a DOOR at the end of the corridor and leads Arthur into a DRAWING ROOM... recreated from Sartre's play. 
INT. DREAM -- DRAWING ROOM -- NEXT 
Arlington leads Arthur inside and closes the door behind him. Inside the DRAWING ROOM, there are THREE COUCHES made in the style.: of the SECOND EMPIRE. The walls are covered in similar Renaissance art and the floor is marble. NORMA and WALTER have now been admitted to the drawing room. Norma is dressed in an elegant BLACK GOWN. Walter wears a tuxedo that looks to be nearly identical to the one his father is wearing... and THERE IS A SILK BLINDFOLD WRAPPED AROUND HIS HEAD. He wanders around the room... lost... The dimensions of the room are equal in every way. It is a perfect three-dimensional box. Arthur then looks to his wife. He notices that her EYELIDS are now gone. Arthur then turns to his son. Walter reaches out into the air... seemingly unaware that they are in, the room with him. The CAMERA moves through the wall into another corridor... BUD WALL... dressed as another VALET, passes by... and the CAMERA moves into another DRAWING ROOM... 
WALTER Dana. She gave it to me. Arthur begins to page through the comic book. 
EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- ROOF TOP -- NEXT 
Arlington kneels at the edge of the MOTEL SWIMMING POOL. He runs his hand through the water. Steam is rising from the surface. STROBES OF WHITE LIGHT begin flicker from beneath the surface... as though some unseen SOURCE OF ENERGY is emanating from down below. Arlington slowly rises to his feet and turns to leave. 
EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arlington approaches the BLACK SEDAN idling in the car port. He gets inside... and Bud drives off. 
INT. SCOPE INSERT -- NIGHT 
The CAMERA looks through a TELESCOPE LENS of some sort from high on a ROOFTOP in downtown Richmond. It scans across several CARS passing down the street... PEDESTRIANS on the sidewalk... landing on ARLINGTON and BUD as they move toward the entrance of a STONE FRONT BUILDING. 
EXT. RICHMOND ROOFTOP -- NIGHT 
We see that a SNIPER, dressed in a dark suit, is perched on the roof of an adjacent building. He has an earpiece in his left ear. 
SNIPER Alright... they are entering the building from the south entrance on fourteenth street. 
INT. RICHMOND GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arlington and Bud move down the main corridor of the GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING, approaching a bank of ELEVATORS. A SECURITY GUARD nods to them nervously. Arlington nods back. 
INT. RICHMOND GENERAL ASSEMBLY BUILDING -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arlington and Bud emerge from the elevators on the THIRD FLOOR and move down the hall. As they pass into a RECEPTION AREA, the CAMERA moves toward a GLASS PARTITION with the VIRGINIA STATE EMBLEM etched into the glass. Below it is a name: 
HOUSE OF DELEGATES 
GRIFFITH POWELL - MAJORITY LEADER 
INT. GRIFFITH POWELL'S OFFICE -- RECEPTION -- NEXT 
As they approach the RECEPTION AREA... the FEMALE RECEPTIONIST ( 30s) stands up anxiously behind her desk.

ARLINGTON Where is he? 
RECEPTIONIST Uhhh... he's in a meeting. 
ARLINGTON I need to see him... now. 
INT. GRIFFITH POWELL'S OFFICE -- NEXT 
The RECEPTIONIST comes into the office. Griffith Powell stands at the window behind his desk... smoking a cigarette. He is dressed in a TUXEDO with his jacket hanging next to his desk. 
RECEPTIONIST He's here... I don't know what to do. Powell turns to face her. 
POWELL Let him in. The Receptionist goes back out... and within moments... Arlington and Bud enter the office. The Receptionist closes the door and leaves them alone. 
ARLINGTON Hello Senator. 
POWELL 
(TERRIFIED) Mr. Steward... it's good to see you. 
ARLINGTON Call me Arlington. 
POWELL Okay... Arlington. Bud just stares at the Senator... showing no sign of emotion. 
ARLINGTON Do you have my money? 
POWELL I've given you four-hundred thousand already. How much more are you going to need? 
ARLINGTON As much as it takes. Powell sighs out loud... irritated. 
EXT. FOREST LAWN SQUARE -- NIGHT 
The WEDDING PARTY comes pouring out of the church. There is a massive LAWN south of the entrance. During the holidays it is filled with CHRISTMAS TREES for sale, and dozens of ARTS & CRAFTS BOOTHS assembled in rows. The CAMERA moves through the crowd to find Norma posing for photos with her fellow bridesmaids out in front of the square. ACROSS THE SQUARE... Bud Wall lurks within the rows of Christmas Trees. He spies Arthur and Walter mingling with his parents and Senator Powell, who has TWO SECRET SERVICEMEN standing close by. 
EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- LATER ON 
The CAMERA approaches the driveway of the VIRGINIA HOUSE... which is positioned at the south end of Forest Lawn square. Wedding guests are arriving in droves. The house is a large GOTHIC MANSION that is often rented out for public events... and in this case... for the lavish WEDDING RECEPTION of Deborah Burns and Edward Powell. 
EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK LAWN -- LATER ON 
Arthur and Norma move through the courtyard into the wedding reception area... which flows through several TENTS that have been erected with HEAT LAMPS and tables covered in WHITE TABLECLOTHS and FLORAL ARRANGEMENTS. Arthur carries the copy of No Exit with him. 
ARTHUR The play tells the story of uhree people, condemned to hell. They are to remain in a second empire drawing room for all of eternity. He closes the book... his mind dissecting what he has just read. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) They soon discover that their eyelids are missing... and for all eternity they will be unable to sleep. Norma remembers most of the play from high school. 
NORMA There are no mirrors... so they will never be able to see their own reflection... but only the faces of their tormentors. 
ARTHUR This is Sartre's vision of hell. 
NORMA Because Hell... is other people. The look into one another's eyes... Norma sees a WAITER pass by with a tray of CHAMPAGNE. They both take a glass. Jim crosses the lawn to greet them. 
JIM Arthur... can I speak with you privately for a moment? 
ARTHUR Sure. Arthur walks away with Jim toward the edge of a PATIO that overlooks the whole party. 
EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- UPPER PATIO -- MOMENTS LATER 
Jim and Arthur stand at a table. Jim has several PHOTOGRAPHS laid out on the table. They are mostly family photos taken from the house of Robert Bevilacqua. 
JIM And do you know this fella? Robert Bevilacqua? 
ARTHUR Yeah... I know him. He works at 
NASA. 
JIM Do you know his wife? 
ARTHUR No... 
JIM Well... he shot and killed his wife yesterday morning. 
ARTHUR No... 
JIM Yeah... He shot her point blank in the chest in his kitchen. Arthur takes a deep breath. He isn't feeling well. 
JIM (CONT'D) This Bevilacqua fella... if he tries to contact you or Norma... you have to call me immediately, you understand? 
ARTHUR Yeah. Of course. Arthur looks down at the lawn. Norma is staring back at them. 
EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK LAWN -- LATER ON 
Norma is now standing up on stage with a MICROPHONE in her hand..,. giving her MAID OF HONOR speech. 
NORMA My little sister once asked me... what's the best thing about being married? Norma looks across the lawn to the table where Arthur is seated, next to Walter and their parents. 
NORMA (CONT'D) I told her that... it's knowing that for the rest of your life you'll never feel alone. 
(BEAT) Not ever again. She smiles at her husband. 
NORMA (CONT'D) That is... until you get divorced. There is laughter from the crowd. Deborah blushes... leaning her head on her new husband's shoulder. 
NORMA (CONT'D) Or... until he decides to kill you. More laughter. 
EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DANCE FLOOR -- LATER 
Arthur and Norma are now slow dancing. 
INTO CHAOS... 
INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- MEN'S BATHROOM -- NEXT 
Arthur is now standing at the urinal. He begins to hear commotion outside. He turns his head to the left... when something COLD and METAL locks itself around his wrist. Arthur turns back to the right and sees that it is Robert Bevilacqua. He is standing at the urinal next to him and they are now HAND-CUFFED TOGETHER at the wrists. Bevilacqua retrieves a GUN from his pocket at points it at Arthur. He has dark circles under his eyes. 
BEVILACQUA You can still save yourself. It's too late for me... but you can still save yourself. 
ARTHUR Bevilacqua... 
BEVILACQUA Follow me out through the kitchen. I have a truck waiting... 
INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK CORRIDOR -- NEXT

INT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT 
Arthur and Bevilacqua move through the kitchen. The WAITERS and WAITRESSES are all distracted by the commotion and barely take notice of them as they pass through... 
EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Walter walks down the driveway as several POLICE OFFICERS rush past him, moving toward the entrance of the house. The whole place is being evacuated... He looks toward the square... and begins to move in that direction. The CAMERA drifts back toward the ROCK PILLAR that stands at the entrance to the house. Arlington is standing there in front of it. He is wearing his black hat... pulled down low. He begins to follow Walter toward the square... 
EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK DRIVEWAY -- NEXT 
Arthur and Bevilacqua come out the back entrance into the driveway. There is a WHITE PICKUP TRUCK parked there. Bevilacqua opens the passenger side door and the two of them slide across the seat, Bevilacqua behind the wheel. 
EXT. FOREST LAWN SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Walter wanders through a group of CHRISTMAS CAROLERS... moving toward the maze of CHRISTMAS TREES. He looks over his shoulder... where Arlington emerges from a crowd... staring him down like a monster. Walter's face is ghost white with terror. He begins to walk faster through the maze. 
EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER 
Norma comes down the driveway with her mother and sister... overcome with shock... searching the crowd... 
NORMA Walter? 
EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- BACK DRIVEWAY -- NEXT 
Bevilacqua puts the truck into drive and speeds out of the driveway onto the street. Jim stands across the lawn, manning the chaos. He recognizes the two men as the pass him by... and he raises his WALKIE- TALKIE to his mouth. 
JIM I just spotted Bevilacqua... he's in a white pick-up truck. Potential hostage situation. 
EXT. FOREST LAWN SQUARE -- MOMENTS LATER 
Walter winds his way through the maze of Christmas trees... rounding a corner... where he runs into DANA. 
DANA Walter... 
WALTER Hey. Bud arrives next to her. 
DANA Is everything alright? 
WALTER No. 
DANA Come with us. She takes his hand and they move north back toward the church. 
EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT 
The WHITE PICK-UP drives south down 1-95. 
INT. WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK -- NEXT 
Bevilacqua has his hands on the steering wheel... Arthur's left arm extended due to the hand-cuffing. 
BEVILACQUA 
RESTON My name is Reston Steward. I work for the CIA. 
NORMA Yeah? Where is my son? Where is my husband? 
RESTON Please... get into the car. Norma stares at him in disbelief... as he opens the back door and gestures inside. 
RESTON (CONT'D) 
(GENTLE) Please... there isn't much time. 
EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT -- LATER ON 
Jim Burns walks through the aftermath of the crash site. There are now several FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCES and other EMERGENCY VEHICLES scattered on either side of the interstate. Robert Bevilacqua's DEAD BODY is now on a stretcher. Jim looks down at him briefly... then turns to another OFFICER on the scene. 
JIM Where's Arthur? 
OFFICER #1 They took him away in an ambulance. 
INT. AMBULANCE -- NEXT 
Arthur sits up in the back of the ambulance. He has a small scrape on his cheekbone... but otherwise appears unharmed. An EMS TECHNICIAN is in there with him. He hands Arthur an 
ICE PACK. 
EMS TECHNICIAN Here... hold this against your forehead. It'll keep your head from swelling. Arthur takes the ice pack and places it against his head. 
ARTHUR Thanks. 
EMS TECHNICIAN I think it might have been a miracle. The EMS Technician shakes his head in disbelief. 
ARTHUR What? 
EMS TECHNICIAN That car accident. I've never seen someone walk away from an accident like that. 
(BEAT) Somebody upstairs is looking out for you, buddy. The door to the ambulance opens. A US ARMY OFFICER appears. He steps away from the doors and General Teague emerges from the darkness. 
TEAGUE Are you able to walk, son? 
ARTHUR Yes, sir. 
TEAGUE Please step out of the ambulance. 
EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- PARKING LOT -- NEXT 
Arthur steps out of the ambulance and sees that it is parked in front of a HOWARD JOHNSON HOTEL on an exit of 1-95. The hotel has a DINER attached to it. There are more than a dozen POLICE CARS parked in front, along with..several BLACK SEDANS and MILITARY VEHICLES. Arthur hears the rumble of a HELICOPTER circling the sky above them. Its SEARCHLIGHT sweeps through the forest. In front of the diner entrance... more than a DOZEN MEN operate VIDEO CAMERAS and STILL CAMERAS mounted on tripods, all pointed toward the front window of the diner. Teague is standing with Cahill and Reston, along with several other MILITARY PERSONNEL. Arthur notices Norma as she emerges from a BLACK SEDAN... she looks exhausted... delirious. 
NORMA Arthur! 
ARTHUR Norma! She hugs him... neither has slept in two days. 
NORMA Where's Walter? 
ARTHUR I don't know. Reston steps forward. 
RESTON My brother has taken your son... but he assures me that he is alive and well. Reston tries to comfort them with a smile. 
RESTON (CONT'D) Take a walk with us. Norma and Arthur begin to walk with Reston, Teague and Cahill toward the diner entrance. 
RESTON (CONT'D) Are you familiar with the myth of Prometheus? 
ARTHUR Yeah. 
RESTON In the 1940s... when NASA was formed, we began developing, in secret, a project that we dubbed the Prometheus Effect. 
TEAGUE Projecting fictional scenarios about how we would respond, if and when we came into contact with an alien intelligence. 
RESTON If the intelligence had hostile intent... or if it began to somehow display proof of its ability to destroy us, we would have a system in place to begin negotiating with it in secret. 
EXT. WILLOW LAWN MOTEL -- POOL -- NEXT 
UNDERWATER... Walter floats with his arms spread wide... WHITE STROBES OF LIGHT FLICKER AROUND HIM. The light streaks bear a close resemblance to the image in the -Mars photo. Blood streams out from his foot into the water. 
INT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- NEXT 
Blood is now flowing out of Reston's left nostril. Both Arthur and Norma recoil in horror. 
RESTON/ARLINGTON He is now blind and deaf. 
(BEAT) For the rest of his life, he will never hear your voice... or see your face. 
ARTHUR (under his breath) Why... 
RESTON/ARLINGTON You are now presented with two options. 
(BEAT) Option one... you enjoy the rest of your lives with the money you have been given, and you learn to live with your son's disability. Reston then reaches into his pocket and retrieves a PISTOL. He places it on the table next to the box. 
RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D) And then there is option number two. 
(BEAT) There is one bullet in the chamber of this gun. Reston slides the gun across the table in Arthur's direction. 
RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D) You can fire this bullet into your wife's heart... killing her. 
(BEAT) At the exact moment that her spirit departs the earth, this curse upon your son will be reversed, and both of his impaired senses will instantaneously return to normal. 
Arthur looks over at Norma in disbelief... then back at the twins. He cannot fathom how it has now come to this. 
RESTON/ARLINGTON (CONT'D) Arthur, you will then be arrested and charged with the murder of your wife... and the money will be placed in an interest bearing trust for your son to receive upon his eighteenth birthday. 
NORMA That's not fair. 
(BEAT) Let me do it. I, pushed your stupid button. If I deserve to be punished for it... then let me kill myself. Arthur has nothing to do with this. 
RESTON/ARLINGTON I'm sorry, but the offer is not negotiable. 
(TO ARTHUR) And if Norma's fingers so much as touch the weapon at any point from this moment on... the restoration of Walter's sight and sound will be denied. 
NORMA If Arthur has to do it... then I want you to make it look like a suicide. Arthur shouldn't be punished for something that I did. 
RESTON/ARLINGTON I'm sorry... but the terms of the offer are not negotiable. Arthur faces has gone completely white. 
ARTHUR Is there an afterlife? The twins smile cryptically in response to Arthur's question. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Because this is purgatory, right? The earth is purgatory... and you're here to start shutting things down... right? The twins appear impressed with his foresight. 
RESTON/ARLINGTON I find your theory to be quite fascinating. But I must remind you that I am unable to disclose the identity of my employers. Arthur glances out the window at all of the cameras. 
ARTHUR Right. I get it. Reston then turns to the window... 
RESTON/ARLINGTON Can someone please bring up the car? 
EXT. HOWARD JOHNSON -- DINER -- MOMENTS LATER 
Arthur and Norma emerge from the diner in a state of delirium. A SOLDIER pulls up in Arthur's TRANS-AM. He steps out of the car and holds the door open. Teague and Cahill approach... as MEN in dark suits snap hundreds of photographs of the couple. Cahill puts his hand on Arthur's shoulder... searching for words. Teague glances inside the diner... then back at Arthur. Arthur nods his head slowly... his mind lost... and he limps toward the car with Norma at his side. 
INT. ARTHUR'S CAR -- NEXT 
Norma sits behind the wheel... allowing Arthur to ride shotgun. He looks weakened by the whole ordeal, and she is afraid he might pass out. 
ARTHUR Tell me this isn't happening, Norma. 
NORMA This isn't happening... She starts the engine... and they drive off. Arthur watches the parking lot full of MEN reflected back at them in the side-view mirror. 
EXT. INTERSTATE 95 -- SUNRISE 
HELICOPTER SHOT: The CAMERA flies over 1-95 as Arthur's car travels north toward Richmond. A MILITARY HELICOPTER flies overhead... escorting them on their journey home.

CAN YOU HEAR ME?!!! 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NEXT 
No response... just his head... slamming against the door repeatedly. 
ARTHUR We need to kick the door down. 
NORMA He could get hurt... 
Norma begins to pound back on the door with her fist... and eventually the thumping stops. She begins to hear quiet sobs from inside the bathroom. 
WALTER Who's there? Who's there? Norma rises to her feet. 
NORMA Come downstairs, Arthur. She takes his left hand... as he clutches Walter's hand in his right. 
NORMA (CONT'D) Arthur... 
(BEAT) I need you to come downstairs with me... right now. 
INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT 
SUZANNE WELLER (30s) sits on her bed. Her husband KENNETH WELLER (30s) stands at the window. Neither looks like they have slept in a while. Suzanne has the box sitting on the mattress in front of her... the glass dome is open. 
SUZANNE I'm gonna push it. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT 
Arthur and Norma stand across from one another in the kitchen. Arthur holds the GUN in his right hand... and he slowly limps over to his wife and takes her into his arms. 
ARTHUR Norma... 
NORMA Arthur... I love you, and I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry that I did this to us... 
ARTHUR I'm the one who told you to push the button... so don't apologize. He looks out through the window at his back yard... likely for the last time. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) I love you too... and please know... that I regret nothing in this life we've lived together. 
NORMA I'll be waiting... counting the days until my Arthur comes to see me. 
INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT 
Suzanne Weller smiles at her husband... reaches her finger out and places it on the button. She then presses down. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT 
FROM UPSTAIRS... thump... thump... their son's head banging against the door... 
NORMA It's going to be harder for you to live than for me to die. Arthur closes his eyes... the noise is excruciating. There is no time to wait any longer. 
ARTHUR Well then. 
(BEAT) Let's get on with it. Arthur kisses her... then steps back... still clutching her hand... raises the gun... and fires off a round into her heart. Norma collapses... Arthur falls with her... breaking her fall with his arms as they collapse into a heap onto the linoleum floor. 
INT. WELLER HOUSE -- BEDROOM -- NEXT 
Suzanne looks over at her husband and lets out a deranged giggle. He smiles back. 
INT. LEWIS HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NEXT 
Arthur looks down into his wife's eyes as the life drains from her body. Seconds later... Norma is dead. 
BLOOD begins to flow from the exit wound in her back across the linoleum. Arthur is now covered in it.

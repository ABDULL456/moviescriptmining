EXT. RURAL SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN - PRESENT DAY 
A 5-year old girl wearing pajamas wanders alone down the street. 
FRANKIE (BARELY AUDIBLE) Me-gan! 
INT. PERIERA HOME - PRESENT DAY 
FRANKIE crawls through a dog door. She walks into the living room where the TV is on loud. 
DEAN PERIERA, 30 years old, hefty, sleeps in a lazyboy. 
FRANKIE (HUSHED) Daddydaddydaddy. 
Frankie uses the footrest to crawl up onto her dad's belly. 
FRANKIE (CONT'D) Wake up Daddy. 
DEAN (WAKING) What time is it baby? 
She sniffles. He notices. 
EXT. PERIERA HOME - BACK/FRONT YARDS - PRESENT DAY 
The back door opens and Dean carries Frankie to the yard. The first yellow rays of sunlight hit their faces. 
He looks over the lawn, an empty bowl, water tin and a doghouse posting the name MEGAN. He peeks inside the doghouse. There's no one home. Dean moves to the fence. The gate is open. 
Dean carries Frankie to the front yard. They look around. 
FRANKIE When's she going to get back? 
DEAN She probably just went out for a run. She'll be back soon because she's going to get thirsty. 
FRANKIE She's going to be thirsty?

DEAN You know what we should do? We should leave her bowl full of water and her dish full of food. Because she's gotta get hungry and thirsty sometime. You know? 
Dean's optimism is infectious. Frankie nods slowly. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Like me. I'm hungry. I'm so hungry I could eat your toes. 
Dean pretends to gnaw at Frankie's toes. Breaks her sadness. 
INT. PERIERA HOME - BEDROOM - 6:12AM - PRESENT DAY 
CINDY PERIERA, 28, sleeps in bed. Sunlight spills through translucent yellow curtains into a small master bedroom. 
Dean sets Frankie down on the bed, motions to her to be silent. He sniffs the air. She follows. They eye each other and pounce. Cindy wakes up with a gasp. 
CINDY I'm sleeping! 
DEAN We're hungry! We're going to eat you. 
They pin her arms above her head and 'furber' her armpit. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Don't laugh. Come on, don't laugh! 
Cindy doesn't laugh, she screams. 
INT. PERIERA HOME - VARIOUS - MORNING - LATER - PRESENT DAY 
Cindy, nursing a weight-loss drink, scans through digital photos on the computer. We see - family on vacation, Frankie's first day of school, Frankie and a black and white Border Collie mutt - Megan. Cindy exports the picture when... A tea kettle whistle blows. 
Dean and Frankie sit at the table. He plays a song for Frankie on a ukulele. Cindy gets up, turns off the kettle. 
DEAN (to Frankie) (cont'd) Love you. 
FRANKIE I love you. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 5. 7 CONTINUED: 7 
DEAN (to Cindy) Love you. 
He kisses her on the corner of her mouth. A hesitation. 
CINDY ...Love you. 
Dean pulls his head out of the window. 
DEAN Put your seat belt on. 
She starts to back up. 
DEAN (CONT'D) C'mon. What's the big deal? 
Cindy does as she's told, looks over her shoulder, scrapes the curb. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Watch... 
Cindy cranks the wheel straight, puts on the gas and burns down the road. 
Dean stands there in his driveway, muttering to himself. He watches the car disappear down the street. 
Another car, headed the opposite direction, barrels down the road, past the Periera home. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Slow that piece of shit down! 
INT. CLINIC - DAY - PRESENT DAY 
Cindy clicks the "print" button on a computer, moves to the printer. It spits out a "Missing Dog" flyer. 
DR. SAM FEINBERG - handsome, well-groomed, unshakable confidence - appears at the door, with coffee. 
FEINBERG There you are. 
Cindy places the flyers in her folder in a rush. 
CINDY Sorry...I'm almost done.

CINDY I know I know. I should know for sure by Monday. 
FEINBERG All right, Monday's our day. I want the A team up there with me. Talk it over. 
Feinberg walks away down the hallway. 
CINDY I will. 
INT. VAN - DAY - PRESENT DAY 
Dean drives with a beer in a koozie and a cigarette. He has a coughing fit, rolls down his window and spits. 
CHARLEY - late 30s, hefty, African American - sits in the passenger seat. He pops the top to a Styrofoam coffee cup. 
They talk about sex, women and broken fantasies. But Dean's attention is on the side of the road, scanning the neighborhood for Megan. He whistles sharp and loud. 
CHARLEY Cheer up man. God wants you to be happy. 
DEAN God's a woman and she's pissed off at me. 
Dean lifts two large boxes and moves toward the stairs. 
CURTIS Whoa whoa. You gonna break your neck homey. Look down. 
Dean does. All he sees is brown box. 
CURTIS (CONT'D) Can't see your feet. If you can't see your feet, how you gonna know where the step is? You goin' bust your ass. 
Curtis takes the boxes from Dean and demonstrates. 
CURTIS (CONT'D) Turn around. 
Curtis hefts the boxes on Dean's back. He pulls his arms around the back to hold onto them in an awkward position. 
CURTIS (CONT'D) You gotta be a mule. Always carry on your back. Give `er a try. 
Dean is unsure. He proceeds, imbalanced down the stairs. 
He makes it to the truck where Saned waits to help him get the boxes in. Dean can't quite manage a 30-pound, behind the back hand-off. He ends up spilling up the boxes and their contents all over the sidewalk. Saned gets pissed. Dean gets down on his hands and knees and packs up the boxes - quickly.

CINDY What are you doing? 
DEAN Taking us away. We gotta get outta this house. (Back to phone) It's still good? Good... Well, what rooms do you got?...Hold on a minute...

INT. LIQUOR MART - AFTERNOON - PRESENT DAY 
- Cindy jerks out a grocery cart, pushes it, scans the aisles of the massive liquor store. - Tucks two large bottles of champagne under her arm. - she tries on different pairs of sunglasses at the display. She assumes the character that each pair suggests. She is a tough guy cop when... 
BOBBY (O.S.) Is that Cindy Heller? 
Cindy turns and sees BOBBY ONTARIO, her college sweetheart. She lifts the glasses on her head, blood rushes to her face.

Dean blows on a hot cup of coffee. Cindy moves fast, loads in the bags next to their luggage, slams the hatch closed and snatches the keys from Dean's hands. 
CINDY Let's go. 
DEAN You're drivin'? 
Cindy hops in the driver's seat. Dean rides on the end of the buggy and crashes it into the buggy corral. She fires up the engine and honks. He throws his hands up. 
INT. MINI VAN - LATE AFTERNOON - PRESENT DAY 
Cindy drives the car along a windy, mountain road. Dean keeps a lidless cup of coffee from spilling. 
DEAN Alright, lead foot. It's not a race. 
Cindy is zoned into the road. She turns off the radio. 
CINDY Isn't it funny how you can be driving for 20 minutes and it feels like you've only been driving for 20 seconds. The time just gets swallowed up somewhere... 
Dean places his hand on Cindy's hand that rests on the car seat. A small squeeze. She squeezes back. Dean looks at her with tenderness. Her eyes are on the road. She lifts her hand to the wheel. Dean reaches for the radio. 
DEAN Do you mind if I turn this back on? 
CINDY I was kind of enjoying the silence. 
DEAN Let's just see if there's something on... 
He scans through the low stations. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Anything? Fuck it. 
He turns it off. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 22. 42 CONTINUED: 42 
DEAN (CONT'D) That's better. You're right. It never gets to be just quiet. You know? 
Cindy nods. Dean rolls down his window, spits his gum as far as he can. He rolls it back up. 
DEAN (CONT'D) What are you thinking about? 
Dean looks at Cindy, waiting for her to respond. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Did you get everything? 
CINDY Think so. 
DEAN Where d'you get these? 
Dean reaches for the glasses on top of Cindy's head. She feels the dangling tag - "woops." She tears off the tag and tosses the glasses on the dashboard. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Try em' on. 
Cindy shakes her head "no." Dean puts them on his face. He poses for Cindy. She grabs the glasses and puts them on. She looks at Dean. He holds in a chuckle. 
DEAN (CONT'D) You look like your mom. 
Cindy takes them off. Back on the dash. 
DEAN (CONT'D) You get any snacks? 
CINDY There should be some fig newtons back there. 
GLENDA HELLER - 50's, desperate - peeks her head out of the kitchen. She holds a coffee mug filled with gin on the rocks. 
GLENDA Ope - I thought you were your Dad. 
CINDY Just us. 
Cindy kisses her mom on the cheek, can smell the alcohol. 
GLENDA How was the beauty shop? 
INT. HELLER HOME - FOYER - LATER - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
The front door opens and COLONEL JERRY - 65, wound tighter than a navy knot - enters. Glenda, rushes to greet him. 
JERRY Get that fucking dog out of the kitchen!

GLENDA, JERRY AND GRAMMA Come lord Jesus, be our guest, and let Thy gifts to us be blessed. Amen. 
Glenda, Jerry, Gramma Francis and Cindy sit around a dining room table. Glenda slices a knife through a greenish meatloaf. She serves a watery slice to Gramma. 
GRAMMA Thank you. 
Glenda averts her eyes. She cuts another slice. Cindy offers Glenda her plate. The meat breaks apart and half of it lands on the table cloth. A brownish-green oil. 
CINDY It's OK mom. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 26. 48 CONTINUED: 48 
Cindy picks up the fallen particles with her fork. Jerry's eyes burn into Glenda. She won't look at him. 
GLENDA Can I have your plate Dad? 
He pushes it across the table an inch. Glenda lowers a slice onto Jerry's plate with a SPLAT. Jerry looks at his dinner. Glenda serves herself. Cindy cuts Gramma's meat with her fork and looks over at her dad. His face is turning beat-red... 
Suddenly, Jerry pounds his fist into the mound of meatloaf, obliterating it. Particles of ground meat fly everywhere. Glenda won't look up, her shoulders tremble. Jerry raises his steaming fist. Bits of ground beef stick to his knuckles. 
JERRY What'd you do to meatloaf? Huh?! 
GLENDA They had it ready-made in the deli. I... thought it looked good. 
JERRY Are you kidding me? How long does it take to make a meatloaf? Five minutes? You mean to tell me that you didn't have five minutes to make a meatloaf? I been up since six this morning busting my fucking ass and you don't have five minutes to make a meatloaf? 
GLENDA I thought it would be nice. 
JERRY Nice? 
GLENDA ...for a change... 
JERRY Well, what gave you the idea that any of us needed a change? Did you ask for a change? Cindy? She doesn't ask for anything... She doesn't talk. You didn't ask for a change, did you mom?...She can't hear! And I don't remember asking for a change. So, it was you, wasn't it? You wanted a change. I work all day so you can sit on your fat ass, thinkin' about yourself. How you'd like a change. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 27. 48 CONTINUED: (2) 48 
GLENDA Sorry. 
JERRY Sorry? What good is sorry now? 
GLENDA Do you want me to make you some eggs? 
JERRY I want you to enjoy your fucking dinner. 
He storms out of the dining room. Glenda, Cindy and Gramma sit in silence. Cindy takes a bite. 
CINDY It's not bad. 
GLENDA Oh bullshit. 
Glenda retreats into the kitchen. Gramma and Cindy eat. 
PROFESSOR (O.S.) ...When I was a young physician, I used to leave the hospital everyday in tears.

(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 30. 56 CONTINUED: 56 
CINDY Give em! 
Cindy presses her lips together. She leaps at Bobby and squeezes his crotch and gets her underwear back. Bobby's face turns vicious. He snatches them back aggressively. 
BOBBY Say you're sorry! 
Cindy picks her pants up off the floor - pulls them on. 
CINDY Take a deep whiff, you fucking douchebag! 
She tears off his necklace, throws it at him, slams the door.

handsome, catches her eye. It is Dean. She cranes her head to see - him decorating the inside of the old man's room. 
GRAMMA What is it? (CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 30A. B61 CONTINUED: B61 
CINDY It looks like you have a new neighbor. 
Cindy returns to the book, but there is something about the mover that has captured her attention. She can't stop watching him every time he passes her door. 
GRAMMA Glenda... I mean Cindy... can I have a cigarette? 
CINDY No, Gramma, you're in bed now. It's bedtime. Do you want me to keep reading? 
Gramma nods. Cindy turns the page, looks up, sees Dean lift the old man over the threshold and into the room. 
GRAMMA Cindy. Have you got a cigarette! 
CINDY Okay, shhh. But you gotta be quiet. 
Cindy gets up and opens the window. She turns on the fan, digs in Gramma's purse, gets a cigarette and a lighter. Cindy walks to her gramma's door, sees Curtis walking away from the old man's room. 
CURTIS (O.S.) Boss says we gotta go. We gotta go. 
She starts closing the door, then sees Dean backing out of the old man's room. He puts a roll of money in his pocket, turns to leave and sees Cindy watching him. 
DEAN (LOOKS DOWN AT HIS MONEY) I didn't just steal that. 
Cindy doesn't know what this guy is talking about. 
DEAN (CONT'D) (cont'd) You think I just stole that money? 
CINDY No. 
DEAN You do. No, you do. I know that you do. And the reason that I know that you do is - I have stolen money before... a lot of it. And I know what it feels like to have someone look at you like that...

DEAN (disguised voice) Who's this? ...How do you know I'm your father? 
A faint scream of joy is heard through the phone. 
INT. ROMANTASUITES - BATHROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY 
Steam accumulates on mirrors. Cindy takes her clothes off, tests the temperature of the water and steps in the shower. 
INT. ROMANTASUITES - MOON ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY 
Dean paces, improvising a bedtime story. It comes from the well of creativity in him. Frankie loves to hear him talk. And he loves to make her happy. He finishes. She is happy. 
DEAN Are you ready to go to sleep now? I'll call you first thing in the morning, OK? 
He walks into the living room, stretching the phone cord, grabs the remote and turns on the television - animal doc. Dean turns the channel. Tennis. 
DEAN (CONT'D) How much? 
CLICK. The news. 
DEAN (CONT'D) ...Well, I love you more. Sleep tight. 
Dean hangs up and returns to the living room. He changes the station. A porno. He turns the volume down and watches. He hears water running in the BATHROOM. CLICK. A show on space. 
INT. ROMANTASUITES - BATHROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY 
Dean cracks open the door to the steam-filled room. Cindy lathers her hair with her eyes closed. 
DEAN What are you doing?

CINDY It's fine. 
DEAN I'm gonna go order dinner now. 
CINDY Fine! 
DEAN Any special requests? 
CINDY Close the door! 
Dean closes the door, remains in the BATHROOM, watches his naked wife, removes his clothes. Cindy does a double take. 
CINDY (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
Dean pulls back the shower curtain and steps in. 
DEAN What does it look like I'm doing? 
CINDY Dean. 
The small shower presses them close. Dean's smile infects her. He leans over, they kiss. Brushing lips at first. Dean presses closer. Cindy pulls back and pivots him around until the stream of water catches his body. He leans his head back, the water pours over his hair and face. He places his hands on Cindy's hips and pulls her close to him. Cindy hands him a bar of soap. He builds a gentle lather. Cindy inches back, turns around. Dean lathers her back, slow and languid. 
DEAN I remember the first time I saw your back. 
CINDY What do you remember? 
DEAN Everything. 
He lowers his hands from her back to her behind. Cindy turns. 
DEAN (CONT'D) I wasn't done.

Bobby trains, 200 sit ups, his abdomen taught. 
CURTIS (V.O.) At that point they got no choice but to become one river. 
EXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
Dean counts his pay, opens his wallet - packs it with bills. 
CURTIS (V.O.) Sure, it's a great feeling at first, all this new water flowing together. But then you travel down a little ways and the land levels out. The current starts moving a little slower. 
INT. AUDITORIUM CLASSROOM - DAY - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
Papers are passed back. Cindy's reads "98% Great Insight!" She doesn't look happy though. She looks a little green. 
CURTIS (V.O. CONT'D) People start drinking the water. Pissin' in it. Putting up dams to stop the flow. 
In the corner of the room, Bobby stares at Cindy from behind. 
EXT. HELLER HOME - LATE AFTERNOON - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
Cindy pushes Gramma Francis up the driveway. Bobby stands on the porch holding a bunch of red roses. Cindy ignores it.

CURTIS(V.O.) And there's not too many of these rivers that'll make it all the way to the ocean without splitting off eventually. 
INT/EXT. TRUCK - AFTERNOON - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
CURTIS (V.O.) It's just nature, that's all. 
Curtis - with harmonica - and Dean - with ukulele - eat hamburgers on their lunchbreak. 
CURTIS (CONT'D) And instead of thinking about it you gotta just do something about it. Action, not thought. 
INT. STORAGE FACILITY - MORNING. 6 YEARS EARLIER. A79 A79 
DEAN Anyone call for me? 
Dean peeks into Jo's office. She shakes her head "no." 
DEAN Here? 
Cindy gives him a grimace. 
CINDY Same streets. Same people. Everything here is the same. You walk down the street, you can't get lost... you know. (CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 46. 91 CONTINUED: 91 
DEAN Where do you want to go? I mean, if you could go anywhere.. 
They walk to an old playground. Cindy gets an idea. 
CINDY There! 
Cindy runs to an old, creaky merry-go round, jumps on. 
CINDY (CONT'D) I used to love these things. 
DEAN Oh God... I hate these things. 
CINDY Push me. 
Dean is tentative, but goes along with her. He starts slow, but she eggs him to go faster. He runs in circles picking up speed until he is in a breathless, circular sprint. He can't keep up with the centrifugal force. 
CINDY (CONT'D) Get on! 
Dean does as he's told. They both hold on for dear life. The world spins in a frenzy. The dread on Dean's face builds to insane laughter. It is super fun. Cindy screams. Her hair snaps in her face. Then, a look of sickness steals her smile away. She wants it to stop, which, slowly, it does. She gets off first, tries to walk, but is too dizzy. She just keeps falling to the ground. Dean crawls off the merry-go round on all fours, laughing. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 47. 91 CONTINUED: (2) 91 
DEAN What happened, tough guy? 
CINDY Make it stop. 
DEAN You gotta puke... it's the only way. 
She refuses. 
DEAN (CONT'D) It's the only way. It will make you feel better. Don't be embarrassed. I'll do it. 
He sticks his finger down his throat and forces himself to vomit. The sound of it is too much for her. She gags. Side by side, they puke into the gravel. They finish their business and end up on their backs and out of breath, side by side, looking up at the stars. They are both covered in sweat. We see their breath. 
CINDY I'm still spinning. 
DEAN Me too. 
CINDY Maybe it's just the Earth that's spinning. 
DEAN Yeah. We're flying. 
They laugh. Birds begin to awaken and fly. 
DEAN (CONT'D) You should come visit me in the city sometime. 
The morning air chills their bodies. Dean takes off his jacket and uses it as a blanket. They get close together to get warm and watch the stars spin above them. 
INT. ROMANTASUITES - MOON ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY 
The dining room table is set for two. A single champagne glass is raised. 
DEAN To honesty... 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 48. 92 CONTINUED: 92 
They sit across from each other. Cindy drinks premature. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Hey! Wait up. 
CINDY We're toasting tonight? 
Dean makes his toast. CLINK. Dean quaffs his glass. 
CINDY (CONT'D) Sometimes you don't make any sense. You might as well be speaking Chinese. 
Dean imitates a Chinese man - it goes on too long. 
CINDY You know, we rarely sit down and have a conversation. An adult conversation. Because every time we do, you turn something that I say around and make it mean something that I didn't mean to say. You just blab. Blab. 
DEAN If you're not interested in hearing what I think I just won't say anything. 
CINDY Good luck. I just want you to think about what you say sometimes instead of saying what you think all the time. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 51. 92 CONTINUED: (4) 92 
DEAN OK. I'm going to say something. And what I'm about to say I've thought long and hard about. I'm the luckiest person alive because I'm living my dream - you, her, this, us, all of it. 
Cindy lifts up her empty wine glass to the light. 
CINDY I think my glass has a hole in it. 
Cindy cuts around her food and pushes a piece aside. 
DEAN What's wrong with that? 
CINDY It's fat. 
DEAN That's the flavor. Eat it. 
CINDY I don't want to. You eat it. 
Dean stabs a piece of fat and pops it into his mouth. 
CINDY (CONT'D) That's going straight to your tits. 
DEAN My tits? I got tits? 
Dean opens his shirt and peers down at his chest. 
DEAN (CONT'D) I could still kick yer ass. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 52. 92 CONTINUED: (5) 92 
CINDY Shiiit. I bet you a nickel you can't even beat me at arm wrestling. 
DEAN A dime and you're on. 
Cindy gulps more champagne. They scoot dishes out of the way and clasp hands in the middle of the table. 
CINDY Ready? 
DEAN I'm always ready, baby. 
CINDY On the count of three... One... Two... 
Cindy flexes and starts. 
CINDY (CONT'D) THREE! 
Dean, acting as if he isn't trying at all, holds Cindy's hand at a stand still. 
DEAN Come on. Go! Start. 
Cindy ignores his taunts and pushes as hard as she can. Slowly, she begins to push Dean's hand down. Dean groans, letting her win a little. Cindy presses down with all her weight. His hand is centimeters from hitting the table. Then, he turns the tide. Cindy battles back with all the strength she can muster. Dean laughs, realizing her passion for victory. Dean pounds her hand into the table. He stands kisses his flexed bicep. Cindy lifts her hand. A fork is stuck in the back of it. She looks at it with curiosity. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Oh fuck. 
CINDY I'm alright. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 53. 92 CONTINUED: (6) 92 
DEAN Hold still. 
He plucks the fork from her hand, leaving four vampire bites. 
CINDY Ow ow ow. 
Dean leads her to the kitchen, holds her hand under the faucet. 
DEAN You think we should rush you to the hospital before you bleed to death? 
CINDY You're drunk. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 56. 93 CONTINUED: (3) 93 
DEAN No, I'm just still in love with you. 
After a moment, their lips meet in an awkward rejuvenation. She moves her head away and pats Dean on the shoulder in a gesture of friendship. Dean kisses her neck. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Do you... you want to have another baby? ... I want another child. 
Cindy bites her lip. He slides his hand between her legs. 
CINDY No... Dean... Wait a second. 
She removes his hand and places it on her hip. Dean continues to kiss her neck. He slides his hand up to her breasts. Cindy turns her head in the other direction. She pushes his hand away. He brings it back aggressive. Again. Cindy squirms underneath him. He grabs her wrists and holds her arms over her head. His tongue licks Cindy from her breasts to her face. She worms her arms away and grabs onto his hair. She arches her back, looks at him through slit eyes. His pelvis pulses and he moans. He looks up at her over his brow into her desperate eyes. He springs up. Sweat beads on his forehead. 
DEAN What!? I can't have sex with my wife!? 
Cindy covers her face with her hand. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Do I repulse you that much? I'm good to you. I'm good to Frankie. I deserve a little affection. Do you want me to stop loving you? Do you want me to fuck other women? Do you want me to beat you? 
CINDY Stop... stop... stop... 
DEAN Is that what you think you deserve? Would that make it easier on you so you can treat me like this? 
Cindy raises her hips and slips off her panties. She lifts the shirt up over her head, positions her feet on the door jam. Her arm falls over her eyes. Breathless, Dean awkwardly moves one hand up and down her bodice. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 57. 93 CONTINUED: (4) 93 
He unbuckles his belt, pushes his pants and underwear down to his knees, holds himself in his hand. He lowers onto her. Cindy adjusts her legs higher. He rotates his hips, looks away in concentration. Cindy's arms move around him, grabbing the small of his arching back. His pelvis humps in a feeble performance. A small moan. Cindy's eyes press closed harder. The erratic motion slows... stops. Dean's raspy breathing. His weight covers Cindy. She opens her eyes to the ceiling. 
DEAN (CONT'D) I'm sorry...I'm sorry...I'm sorry... 
She looks at him. His head faces away. She rolls out from underneath and stands. She wraps her dress around her and slips into the bedroom. 
INT. ROMANTASUITES - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 
Back against the closed door, Cindy turns the lock. Her eyes shift from despair to relief. Her gaze grows more wild. The doorknob jiggles. A secret, crazy laugh builds in Cindy that she suppresses. Dean presses his face into the bedroom door. He talks to her. 
On the other side of the door, Cindy listens. Dean's voice cracks. A wave of confusion backs Cindy away from the door. She searches the room for an escape. There are no windows, the only way out is through the locked door. Trembling, she wraps her arms around herself. She tries to make herself as small as possible. The spaceship bed is the only place where she can disappear. She crawls underneath the covers, curls into a tight ball. Sadness lets loose. Cindy's body pulses with faint, painful tears. The black walls of the room twinkle with stars suspended in space. The cries get lost. 
EXT. CITY. NIGHT. 6 YEARS EARLIER. 
Drunk, Dean and Cindy make out on the street corner. It is cold enough to see their breath. Their hands caress each other, feel what is underneath the layers of clothes. Cindy makes a move. She unbuttons Dean's Pea-Coat, feels the shape of his chest, his abdomen, his back. 
CINDY Are my hands cold? 
DEAN Yes. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 58. 95 CONTINUED: 95 
Dean follows suit, reaching up under her jacket to touch the skin on her lower back. She recoils from the icy touch. 
CINDY You wanna go somewhere. 
DEAN Sure. 
CINDY Where can we go? 
INT. TAXI. NIGHT. 
They make out in the back of a cab. But the cab driver won't allow it. But they can't keep their hands off each other. They try not to get caught. 
INT. DEAN'S FRIEND'S APARTMENT. 5AM. EARLY LIGHT 
The door to Jake's room is cracked open and the TV is on. Dean and Cindy tiptoe in the apartment as quietly as they can. They can't keep their hands off each other. Dean makes a bed for them on the couch where he sleeps - straightening out a couple white sheets. They crawl under with clothes on. 
CINDY (WHISPERS) Is your roommate awake? 
DEAN (WHISPERS) I don't know. Let me go check. 
Dean tiptoes over to Jake's room. Peeks in his door. Returns to the couch where Cindy is taking off her jacket. He crawls back under the sheet. 
DEAN What do you want to do? 
CINDY I don't know. 
DEAN (after a pause) We'll keep it. We'll take care of it. 
Cindy nods. Silence. 
CINDY It's not the right time. 
Dean looks down, pauses and looks back to Cindy. 
DEAN Do you want to take care of it? 
INT. ABORTION CLINIC - DAY - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
A female DOCTOR sits on a wheeled chair in the corner of the room and looks through Cindy's file. 
DOCTOR You can put your clothes on the chair. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 61. 102 CONTINUED: 102 
Cindy does. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) How are you doing? 
CINDY Okay... 
The DOCTOR wheels over to the table in the center of the room. She pulls out a clean sheet of examination table paper. 
DOCTOR I'm going to have you lie up here, and put your feet in the stirrups. 
Cindy gets on the table, looks over at a tray of instruments. The Doctor pulls a mask up over her face - the vacuum aspirator on a wheeled base. Cindy focuses her gaze at the corrugated ceiling, dim light. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) Are you okay? 
CINDY Yeah. 
The Doctor touches Cindy's knee to spread her legs, picks up an instrument off the table. 
DOCTOR I want you to try and relax. This is going to be a little cold. 
The Doctor inserts a speculum into Cindy's vagina. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) There, take a deep breath... What do you do? 
CINDY I'm a student... 
DOCTOR What are you studying? 
The Doctor dips a long swab into a solution, inserts it into her vagina. 
CINDY I'm studying to be a DOCTOR... 
DOCTOR That's what I studied. 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 62. 102 CONTINUED: (2) 102 
She laughs. Cindy doesn't know what to do with her eyes. The Doctor picks up a syringe. 
CINDY What's that? 
DOCTOR This is a mild anesthetic for your cervix. You're going to feel a pinch and then it's going to feel like electricity. 
Cindy looks back up at the ceiling. She steady's her breath. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) Can you cough for me. 
Cindy coughs. 
DOCTOR (CONT'D) Good... Why do you want to be a Doctor? 
Wheels move across the linoleum floor. The Doctor positions the vacuum aspirator. 
CINDY Mediplex... You are going to need to come in... We're going to need to see him... I can't diagnose over the phone... About 20- 30 minutes... Okay? ...okay, bye... 
Cindy hangs up. She holds a clipboard. 
CINDY (reading) (cont'd) Maria? 
A Hispanic women, MARIA GUEVARA - robust, 50's - clutches her purse and rises off a waiting area chair. Cindy smiles. 
CINDY (CONT'D) Right this way.

CINDY Have a seat on the table, Mrs. Guevara. 
Maria has a blank look. 
CINDY (CONT'D) Do you speak English? Hablas Ingles? 
Maria holds her fingers up, indicating an inch. 
MARIA Small. 
CINDY Poquito? 
MARIA Si. 
CINDY Yo tabien. De donde eres tu? 
MARIA El Salvador. 
CINDY So...Tu famalia esta aqui? Here?

CINDY They're in El Salvador? 
MARIA Si....Yo...sola. How you say en Ingles? Sola? 
CINDY Uh...Sola...Alone. 
MARIA Si. Alone. 
CINDY But hopefully not lonely. 
Maria hides her face with her hand and lets out a self- pitying giggle. Cindy looks at her clipboard. 
CINDY (CONT'D) So you're feeling some pain in your left breast. Uh...Tu dueles en tu chiche?

Cindy hands her a paper robe. 
CINDY (CONT'D) Can you take off tu ropas and pongas... put this on? Okay? Comprende? 
Maria nods and takes the robe. Cindy turns to leave. 
CINDY (CONT'D) Lo siento mi Espanol es muy mal. 
INT. CLINIC - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS - PRESENT DAY 
Cindy leaves the room and gets a drink of water from the fountain. Dr. Feinberg approaches her from behind. 
DR. FEINBERG Busy. Haven't sat down yet. Walk with me. 
Cindy's holds her clipboard to her chest. He tilts it down with his finger. 
He turns back to Maria and places his hand on her shoulder. 
DR. FEINBERG (cont'd) It's going to be alright, Mrs. Guevara. 
Cindy backs out of the room. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 74. 
EXT. CLINIC - DAY - PRESENT DAY 
Dean gets out of the Aspen. The kids honk as they drive off. Drunk and stoned, he walks to the entrance of the clinic carrying their suitcases. 
INT. CLINIC - CONTINUOUS - PRESENT DAY 
Dean walks through the lobby and approaches Mimi at the reception desk. He drops his baggage. 
MIMI (ON PHONE) Ma'am you're going to have to bring him in...you have to bring him in... 
DEAN Where's my wife? 
She hands him an in-patient form. Dean looks at it. 
DEAN (CONT'D) I'm not sick. 
Mimi cups her hand over the phone. 
MIMI You need to fill that out, sir. You can go over there. 
Mimi returns to the phone. 
DEAN There's nothing wrong with me. 
Dean hands her back the clipboard. 
MIMI No, you need to fill it out, sir. Bring it back up to me when you're done. 
DEAN Where's my wife? 
Mimi lowers the phone. 
MIMI Who's your wife? 
DEAN Cynthia. Where is she? 
(CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 75. 126 CONTINUED: 126 
MIMI Are you Dean? 
DEAN Yeah, are you deaf or are you just dumb? 
She puts the phone on hold and disappears into the clinic. Dean turns around and looks at the people in the waiting room. He has a slight confrontation with a gang banger. 
Cindy approaches from the hallway. 
CINDY Dean? 
DEAN (TURNS) Saved you a trip. 
CINDY I can see that. How'd you get here? 
DEAN I got a ride. 
Mimi appears behind Cindy. 
DEAN (CONT'D) - I was going out of my mind. I didn't know if there's an emergency. I didn't know if Francis was hurt. Did you think about that? 
CINDY Frankie's fine... 
Dean nods. He looks over Cindy's shoulder at Mimi. 
DEAN Taking pictures? 
Mimi sits down at her desk and picks up a ringing phone. 
CINDY We're not going to do this here. 
FEINBERG What the hell is going on!? 
Dean turns and takes a blind swing at Feinberg. One blow and Feinberg reels against the metal lockers. He hits the ground with a thud. His nose gushes blood. Dean paces around Feinberg like a caged animal. He pulls down a locker with his hand. It crashes to the floor. Cindy kneels over Feinberg. 
CINDY I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let me see. 
FEINBERG You're done. Leave. 
Dean jerks Cindy up off the floor. 
DEAN Get up. 
She hits Dean with a flurry of flailing fists. 
CINDY You son of a bitch! 
Punches catch him in the nose. Cindy bullies Dean backwards with repeated shoves to the chest. He backs up down the hallway. Mimi stands in the hallway. 
MIMI Oh my god. Call 911. I'm going to call 
The doors slide open and Dean backs outside. 
EXT. CLINIC - CONTINUOUS - PRESENT DAY 
CINDY Give me the keys.

She digs into his pocket and fishes them out. She marches to the car, gets in the driver's seat, starts the car - the radio blasts at high decibels. Dean bangs on the passenger side window. Cindy flips the lock. Dean gets in the car. 
CINDY (CONT'D) I want a divorce! 
She has emptied herself. Her whole body is numb and it feels as if she is floating in space. Anger overcomes Dean. He hits the dashboard with concrete fists. 
DEAN I know! 
He grabs the suitcase next to him and opens the door. He throws it through the air into a FIELD - trying rid himself of pain, longing, and desperation. He clutches his wedding ring, but can't yank it off of his fat finger. Finally, he gets it off and tosses it into the field. The moment he releases it, he wishes he hadn't. 
MOMENTS LATER - Dean and Cindy search for the ring. It is lost. Music begins to play in reverse. 
INT/EXT. HOME VIDEO MONTAGE: 
Various Scenes of the Periera family together... 
EXT. FLOWERSHOP. AFTERNOON. 6 YEARS EARLIER. 
All kinds of flowers. Colors, smells. Freshly arranged. Dean studies them. Finds the one's he likes. And steals them. 
EXT. STREET - DUSK - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
We follow Dean from behind - walking down the middle of the street. He holds the flowers. Meanwhile, we hear Cindy asking her gramma questions about love and life. "What's it like to be old?" - "when did men stop looking at you?" She confides her feelings for Dean. (The responses will be real responses - a real conversation). 
INT. HELLER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
Cindy and Gramma sit at the dinner table. The sound of boiling. Steam rises out of the pots and pans. They continue their conversation. Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 80. 
EXT./INT. HELLER HOME - NIGHT - 6 YEARS EARLIER 
Dean finds the house. He straightens himself, walks to the front door, rings the BELL, checks the smell of his hands. 
Jerry, bourbon in hand, opens the door. Dean's face is purple and swollen from the fight. 
DEAN I didn't know if it was pot luck so I brought an eggplant. 
He points at his face. Behind Jerry, Cindy peeks out from the kitchen at the end of the hallway. It is the first time she has seen Dean since the fight. She is shocked. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Face looks like an eggplant, don't it? How you doing sir, I'm Dean. 
Dean holds out his hand. Jerry looks Dean up and down. 
CINDY Oh God. 
Cindy squeezes by her father to Dean. The expression on her face says it all. Dean hands her the flowers, leans in and kisses her. While he's there he whispers. 
EXT. HELLER HOME - DAY - PRESENT DAY 
The front door bursts open and Frankie, still in her leopard costume, charges down the walkway. 
FRANKIE Daddy! Daddy! Mommy! 
Cindy's car sits in the driveway. Cindy gets out, grabs her suitcase. Jerry emerges from the house. Cindy kneels down and hugs Frankie. She is electricity in her arms. 
CINDY Who had candy for breakfast? (CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 83. 137 CONTINUED: 137 
Frankie doesn't answer and squirms out of Cindy's arms. She runs to Dean who gets out of the car like a wounded soldier. 
DEAN Hey sweetheart. 
Frankie leaps into Dean's arms. Cindy walks up to the house. 
CINDY How was Frankie? 
JERRY She was good. Are you OK? 
CINDY I'm OK. 
Cindy kisses her father on the cheek, closes the screen door. 
DEAN (holding Frankie) I can't play right now, okay? 
He releases his wired daughter who runs circles around him. Dean walks up to the porch. He and Jerry stand face to face. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Do you want to get out of my way. 
Jerry backs away. Dean walks past him into the house. 
JERRY I don't know what happened up there. But please Dean, come on. Don't push it. Let it be... 
Dean closes the screen door behind him and locks it. Jerry pulls on the door. 
JERRY (CONT'D) Hey! You can't lock me out of my own house! 
Dean calls back. 
DEAN Keep an eye on Francis. 
JERRY I don't have my oxygen! Hey! Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 84.

Cindy puts on a simple yellow dress. She checks herself in the mirror. Her hand traces the bump on her belly. 
INT. HELLER HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS - PRESENT DAY 
Cindy pours a glass of water. She gulps down aspirin. Dean keeps his distance at the edge of the room. 
In the backyard, Frankie makes herself dizzy by twirling. Jerry cranes his neck to look into the window of his house. 
CINDY I'm not coming home. 
Fear strikes Dean. He presses the base of his palms into his eyes, rubbing until he sees stars. 
DEAN We're not alone here Cynthia. We have a little girl. We need to think about her. 
CINDY I am thinking about her. 
DEAN All you're thinking about is yourself. You. Francis is gonna grow up in a broken home and that's OK with you. 
CINDY I can't let her grow up in a home where her parents don't love each other. 
DEAN Don't love each other? I've only ever loved you. 
Dean approaches her from behind. Reaches out...

Dean wears his baby blue tux. He looks himself up and down in the mirror. Takes a deep breath.

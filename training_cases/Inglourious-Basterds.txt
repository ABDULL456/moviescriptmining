INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS 
Written by 
Quentin Tarantino 
EXT - DAIRY FARM- DAY The modest dairy farm in the countryside of Nancy, France (what the French call cow country). We Read a SUBTITLE in the sky above the farm house; 
CHAPTER ONE 
"ONCE UPON A TIME IN... 
NAZI OCCUPIED FRANCE" This SUBTITLE disappears, and is replaced by another one; 
One year into the German occupation of France". The farm consists of a house, small barn, and twelve cows spread about. The owner of the property, a bull of a man FRENCH FARMER, brings a axe up and down on A tree stump blemishing his property. However simply by sight, you'd never know if he's been beating at this stump for the last year, or just started today. 
JULIE One of his three pretty teenage daughters, is hanging up laundry on the clothes line. As she hangs up a white bed sheet, she hears a noise, moving the sheet aside she see's; 
JULIE'S POV: A Nazi town car convertible, with two little nazi flags attached to the hood, a NAZI SOLDIER behind the wheel, a NAZI OFFICER alone in the back seat, following TWO OTHER NAZI SOLDIERS on motorcycles, coming up over the hill on the country road leading to their farm. 
JULIE Pappa. The French Farmer sinks his axe in the stump, looks over his shoulder, and see's the Germans approaching. The FARMERS WIFE, CHARLOTTE comes to the doorway of their home, followed by her TWO OTHER TEENAGE DAUGHTERS, and see the Germans approaching. The Farmer yells to his family in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH; 
FARMER Go back inside and shut the door. 
IL 
FARMER (to Julie) Julie, get me some water from the pump to wash up with, then get inside with your mother. The young lady runs to the water pump by the house. She picks up a basin, and begins pumping, after a few pumps, water comes out splashing into the basin. The French Farmer sits down on the stump he was previously chopping away at, pulls a handkerchief from his pocket, wipes sweat from off his face, and waits for the Nazi convoy to arrive. After living for a year with the sword of Damocles suspended over his head, this may very well be the end. Julie finishes filling the water basin, and places it on the window sill. 
JULIE Ready Pappa. 
FARMER Thank you darling, now go inside and take care of your mother. Don't run. Julie walks inside the farm house and closes the door behind her. As her father stands up from his stump, and moves over to the window sill with the water basin... .The SOUND of the ENGINES of the two motorcycles and car get LOUDER. The Farmer SPLASHES water from the basin on his face and down his front. He takes a towel off a nail, and wipes the excess water from his face and chest, as he watches the two motorcycles, the one automobile, and the four representatives of the National Socialist Party come to a halt on his property. We don't move into them, but keep observing them from a distance, like the Farmer. The TWO NAZI MOTORCYCLIST are off their bikes, and standing at attention next to them. The NAZI DRIVER has walked around the automobile, and opened the door for his superior. The NAZI OFFICER says to The Driver in UNSUBTITLED GERMAN; 
NAZI OFFICER This is the property of Perrier LaPadite? 
NAZI DRIVER Yes heer Colonel. The Nazi officer climbs out of the back the vehicle, carrying in his left hand n d 
OFFICER Herman, until I summon you, I am to be left alone. 
NAZI DRIVER As you wish Heer Col. The S.S. COLONEL yells to The Farmer in FRENCH, SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH; 
NAZI OFFICER Is this the property of Perrier LaPadite? 
FARMER I am Perrier LaPadite. The S.S. Colonel crosses the distance between them with long strides, and says in French with a smile on his face; 
NAZI OFFICER It is a pleasure to meet you Monsieur LaPadite, I am Colonel Hans Landa of the S.S. COLONEL.HANS LANDA offers the French Farmer PERRIER LAPADITE his hand. The Frenchman takes the German hand in his and shakes it. 
PERRIER How may I help you? 
COL LANDA I was hoping you could invite me inside your home and we may have a discussion. 
INT - LAPADITE FARM HOUSE - DAY The door to the farm house swings open, andtheaFarmer gesturestfor the S.S. COL to enter. Removing his grey S.S. cap, inside the Frenchman's home. Col Landa is immediately greeted with the sight of the Farmers wife, and three pretty daughters standing together in the kitchen, smiling in his direction. The Farmer enters behind him, closing the door. 
VA 
PERRIER Colonel Landa, this is my family. The S.S. COL clicks his heels together, and takes the hand of the French Farmers Wife... 
COL LANDA Col Hans Landa of the S.S. madame, at your service. He kisses her hand, then continues without letting go of his hostess hand... 
COL LANDA please excuse my rude intrusion on your routine. 
FARMERS WIFE Don't be ridiculous, heer Col. While still holding the French Woman's hand, and looking into her eyes, The S.S. Colonel says; 
COL LANDA Monsieur LaPadite, the rumors I have heard in the village about your family are all true. Your wife is a beautiful woman. His eyes leave the mother, and move to the three daughters. 
COL.LANDA 
(CON' T ) And each of your daughters is more lovely then the last. 
PERRIER Merci. Please have a seat. The Farmer offers The S.S. Colonel a seat at the families wooden dinner table. The Nazi officer excepts the French Farmers offer, and lowers himself into the chair. Placing his grey S.S. cap on the table, and keeping his black attache case on the floor by his feet. The Farmer (perfect host) turns to his Wife and says; 
PERRIER Charlotte, would you be so good as to get The Colonel some wine? 
COL LANDA Merci be coupe Monsieur LaPadite, but no wine. This being a dairy farm one would be safe in assuming you have milk? 
CHARLOTTE Oui. 
COL LANDA Then milk is what I prefer. 
CHARLOTTE Very Well. The mother of three, takes a craft of milk out of the ice box, and pours a tall glass of the fresh white liquid for The Colonel. The S.S. Colonel takes a long drink from the glass, then puts it down LOUDLY on the wooden table. 
COL LANDA Monsieur, to both your family, and your cows, I say; Bravo. 
PERRIER Merci. 
PERRIER Amos - six - I believe. And Shosanna, was fifteen or sixteen, I'm not really sure. 
CUT TO 
UXT - DAIRY FARM - DAY The Mother and her three Daughters finish taking the laundry off the clothes line. They can't hear anything going on inside. e three Nazi Soldiers watch the three Daughters. 
SACK TO LANDA AND PERRIER 
COL LANDA Well I guess that should do it. Be begins gathering up his papers, and putting them back into his ttache case. the Farmer, cool as a cucumber, puffs on his pipe. 
COL LANDA However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk? 
it. 
PERRIER But of course. Farmer stands up, goes over to the ice box, and takes out the aft of milk. As he walks over and fills the Nazi Colonel's glass, German Officer talks. 
COL LANDA Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me? 
PERRIER I have no interest in such things. 
COL LANDA But you are aware of what they call me? 
PERRIER I'm aware. 
COL LANDA What are you aware of? 
PERRIER That they call you, "The Jew Hunter". 
COL LANDA Precisely! Now I understand your trepidation in repeating it. Before he was assassinated, Heydrich apparently hated the moniker the good people of Prague bestowed on him. Actually why he would hate the name, "The Hangman", is baffling to me It would appear he did everything in his power to earn it. But I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title, precisely because I've earned it. As "The Jew Hunter" enjoys his fresh milk, he continues to theorize with the french farmer. 
COL LANDA The feature that makes me such a effective hunter of the Jews, is, as opposed to most German soldiers, I can think like a jew. where they can only think like a German, or more precisely, a German soldier. Now if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and predatory instinct of a hawk. 
COL LANDA 
(CON'T) Negro's - gorilla's - brain - lips - smell - physical strength - penis size. But, if one were to determine what attributes the jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat. Now the Fuhrer and Gobbles propaganda have said pretty much the same thing. Where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison a insult. Consider for a moment, the world a rat lives in. It's a hostile world indeed. If a rat were to scamper through your front door right now, would you greet it with hostility? 
PERRIER I suppose I would. 
COL LANDA Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them? 
PERRIER Rat's spread disease, they bite people - 
COL LANDA - Unless some fool is stupid enough to try and handle a live one, rats don't make it a practise of biting human beings. Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that was some time ago. In all your born days, has a rat ever caused you to be sick a day in your life? I purpose to you, any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry. Yet I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you? 
PERRIER No. 
COL LANDA Yet, they are both rodent's, are they not? And except for the fact that one has a big bushy tail, while the other has a long repugnt tail of rodent skin, they even rather look alike, don't they? 
PERRIER It is a interesting thought, beer Colonel. 
COL LANDA However, interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel. If a rat were to scamper through your door, this very minute, would you offer it a saucer of your delicious milk? 
PERRIER Probably not. 
COL LANDA I didn't think so. You don't like them. You don't really know why you don't like them. All you know is, you find them repulsive. (let's the 
METAPHOR sink in) What a tremendously hostile world a rat must endure. Yet, not only does he survive, he thrives. And the reason for this, is because our little foe has a instinct for survival and presavation second to none. And that Monsieur, is what a jew shares with a rat. Consequently, a German soldier, conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding jews. Where does the hawk look? He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar - he looks everywhere, he would hide. But there are many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide. However the reason the Fuhrer brought me off my Alps in Austria, and placed me in French cow country today, is because it does occur to me. Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity. (Changing tone) May I smoke my pipe as well? Th e Farmer's cool facade is little by little eroding. 
PERRIER Please, Cononel, make yourself at home. 
The Jew Hunter, removes both a pipe and a bag of tobacco fixings. The pipe, strangely enough, is a Calabash, made from a "S" shaped goard kith a yellow skin, made famous by Sherlock Holmes. A the Nazi Colonel, busies himself with his smoking life, he ontinues to hold court at the Frenchmans table. 
COL LANDA The other mistake the German soldier make is their severe handling of the citizens who give shelter and aid to the Jews. These citizens are not enemies of the state. They are simply confused people, trying to make some sense out of the madness war creates. These citizens do not need punishing. They simply need to be reminded of their duty in war time. Let's use you as a example Monsieur LaPadite. In this war, you have found yourself in the middle of a conflict that has nothing to do with yourself, your lovely ladies, or your cows - yet, here you are. So Monsieur LaPadite, let me purpose a question. In this time of war, what is your number one duty? Is it to fight the Germans in the name of France to your last breath? Or, is it to harass the occupying army to the best of your ability? Or, is it to protect the poor unfortunate victims of warfare who can not protect themselfs? Or, is your number one duty in this time of bloodshed, to protect those very beautiful women who constitute your family? The Colonel lets the last statement stand. 
COL LANDA That was a question Monsieur LaPadite. In this time of war, What do you consider your number one duty? 
PERRIER To protect my family. 
COL LANDA Now, my job dictates, that I must have my men enter your home, and conduct a thorough search, before I can officially cross your families name off my list. 
COL LANDA 
(CON'T) And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured, they will be. That is unless, you have something to tell me that will make the conducting of a search unnecessary. 
(PAUSE) I might add also, that any information that makes the preforming of My duty easier, will not be met with punishment. Actually quite the contrary, it will be met with reward. And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in anyway, by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country. The Farmer, pipe in mouth, stares across the table at his German opponent. 
COL LANDA You are sheltering enemies of the state, are you not? 
PERRIER Yes. 
COL LANDA Your sheltering them underneath your floorboards aren't you? 
PERRIER Yes. 
ALL Yes, sir! 
LT.ALDO That's what I like to hear. But I got a word of warning to all would-be warriors. When you join my command, you take on debit. A debit you owe me, personally. Every man under my command, owes me, one hundred nazi scalps. And I want my scalps. And all y'all will git me, one hundred Nazi scalps, taken from the heads of one hundred dead Nazi's... .or you will die trying.

BURSTICH GARDEN 
(HITLERS PRIVATE LAIR)" 
INT - BURSTICH GARDEN - DAY In a huge room, ADOLPH HITLER, pounds on a big table with his fist, as he rants at TWO GERMAN GENERALS. They speak GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH; 
HITLER How much more of these jew swine must I endure? They butcher my men like they were fish bait! This pack of filthy degenerates, are doing what the Russian army didn't, and Patton's army couldn't. Turning soldiers of The Third Reich, into superstitious old women! 
GERMAN GENERAL Just the cowards among them mine Fuhrer. Hitler pounds furiously on the desk with his fist. 
HITLER No, no, no, no, no, no! I have heard the rumors myself! Solders of The Third Reich, who have brought the world to there knee`s, now pecking and clucking like chickens. Do you know the latest rumor they've conjured up, in their fear induced delirium? The one that beats my boys with a bat. The one they call "The Bear Jew"...is a Golem. A avenging jew angel, conjured up by a vengeful rabbi, to smite the Aryans! 
GENERAL Mine Fuhrer, this is just soldiers gossip, no one really believes The Bear Jew is a golem. 
HITLER Why not? They seem to be able to elude capture like a aberration. They seem to be able to appear and disappear at will. 
Z}. 
HITLER 
(CON'T) You want to prove their flesh and blood? Then BRING THEM TO ME! I will hang them naked, by their heels, from the eiffel tower! And then throw their bodies in the sewers, for the rats of Paris to feast! The Fuhrer sits down at the table to compose himself, and wipe his greasy black hair out of his face. 
HITLER 
(DISGUSTED) The Bear Jew. He hits the button on the intercom on his desk. 
HITLER 
KLIEST1 KLIEST VOICE comes out of the intercom; 
KLIEST'S VOICE(OS) Year mine Fuhrer. 
HITLER I have a order I want relayed to all German soldiers stationed in France. The Jew degenerate known as The Bear Jew, hence forth, is never to be referred to as The Bear Jew again. We will cease to aid the Americans any longer in there attempt to undermine the German soldier psyche. Did you get that Kliest? 
KLIEST'S VOICE(OS) Yes mine Fubrer. Do you still wish to see Private Butz? 
HITLER Who and what is a private Butz? 
KELIST'S VOICE(OS) He's the soldier you wanted to see personally. His squad was ambushed by Lt.Raines Jews. He was it's only survivor. 
HITLER Indeed I do want to see him, thank you for reminding me. Send him in.

LT. ALDO Now that leaves two ways we can play this out. Either kill ya, or let ya go. Now weather or not you gonna leave this circle alive, depends entirely on you. Aldo takes out a map of the area, and lays it out in front of his prisoner. 
LT.ALDO Up the road a piece, there's a orchard. 'sides you, we know there's another kraut patrol fuckin around here somewhere. Now if that patrol were to have any crackshots, that orchard, would be a goddamn snipers delight. Now if you ever wanna eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you gotta show me on this map, where they are, you gotta tell me how many they are, and you gotta tell me, what kinda artillery they carrying with 'em? 
SGT.RACHTMAN You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger? 
LT.ALDO well, Werner that's where your wrong. Because that's exactly what I expect. I need to know about Germans hidin in trees? And you need to tell me? And you need to tell me, right now? Now take your finger, and point out on this map, where this partys bein held, how manys comin, and what they brought to play with? Werner site, head held high, back straight, chin up, every inch the German hero facing death.

LT.ALDO You see that ole boy battin rocks? WE RACK FOCUS to a one of The Basterds not in the circle. He's wearing a wife beater, and power hitting stones with a baseball bat. Werners eyes go to the ballplayer. 
LT.ALDO That's Sgt.Donny Donowitz. But you might know him better by his nickname, The Bear Jew. Now if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you gotta heard about The Bear Jew? 
SGT.RACHTMAN I heard. 
LT.ALDO What did you hear? 
SGT.RACHTMAN He beats German soldiers with a club. 
LT.ALDO He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does. 
SGT.DONOWITZ back to us, still haven't seen his face. He Babe Ruths a rock soaring into the atmosphere. 
LT. ALDO Now Werner, I'm gonna ask you one last-goddamn-time, and if you still, "respectfully refuse", I'm callin The Bear Jew over here, and he's gonna take that big bat of his, and he's gonna beat your ass to death with it. Now take your wennersitnitzel lickin finger, and point out on this map what I want to know. 
SGT.RACHTMAN Fuck you and your jew dogs.

Extending his arm; 
MR.GOOROWITZ Be my guest. The phone rings. 
TITLE CARD: Which shows a lovely PENCIL SKETCH of the CITY OF PARIS, complete with Eiffel Tower. 
ABOVE IT READS: 
PARIS" 
THEN... The CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we see we're not looking at a TITLE CARD at all, but a CALENDER stuck on the wall of the Little Cinema's Projection Booth. Before we leave it, WE SEE the Month is JUNE. ..The CAMERA finds, the THREE YEARS OLDER SHOSANNA, working as the PROJECTIONIST. It would appear, that Shosanna passed Madame Mimieux's exceptional test. A lyrical Morriconie-like tune PLAYS on the SOUNDTRACK, this will be "Shosanna's Theme". A Little Bell, begins RINGING, on one of the projectors, alerting Shosanna it's time for a REEL CHANGE. Shosanna stands at the projector, watching the old German film she's projecting, waiting for the1st REEL CHANGE MARK... 
SILVER SCREEN of the little cinema. On Screen LENI REFENSHTAL lies horizontal as a ice sickle drips on her head in the old German film, "The White Hell Of Piza Palu", The 1st REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the upper right hand corner of the FRAME...(That tells the projectionist to get ready). 
As the FILM REEL on the lst PROJECTOR rolls out, Shosanna stands ready, waiting by the 2nd PROJECTOR... 
WHEN... 
SILVER SCREEN the 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON in the same place(That's the one). 
SHOSANNA THROWS the lever on the 2nd PROJECTOR, switching the film from projector 1# to projector 2#, executing a perfect REEL CHANGE. As Shosanna's Theme plays on the Soundtrack, we watch viva MONTAGE, her go through her daily chores. Carry heavy film cans up the stairs, empty the rat traps, ect,ect... 
EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT The MARQUEE READS in French: "GERMAN NIGHT LENI REFENSHTAL in PABST WHITE HELL OF PIZA PALU" Shosanna emerges from the cinema carrying two buckets of LETTERS (for the marquee), and a tall ladder. Her chore here, obviously, is to change the show on the marquee. The LITERARY NARRATOR comes on the Soundtrack in ENGLISH; 
NARRATOR(VO) To operate a cinema in Paris during the occupation, one had two choices. Ether you could show new German propaganda films, produced under the watchful eye of Joseph Goebbels. Or... .you could have a German night in your weekly schedule, and show allowed German classic films. Their German night was Thursday. Shosanna, by herself, perched up high on the ladder, changing the letters on the marquee. A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER(about the same age as Shosanna), walks out of the cinema. He sees the ladder with the young French girl on top, and walks over. They speak FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH; 
GERMAN SOLDIER What starts tomorrow? Shosanna looks down, seeing the young German Solder smiling up at her from below. 
LC 3. 
SHOSANNA A Max Linder festival. 
GERMAN SOLDIER Ummmm, I always preferred Linder to Chaplin. Except Linder never made a film as good as "The Rid". The chase climax of "The Kid", superb. Shosanna continues working, not adding to the conversation. 
GERMAN SOLDIER I suppose now you could use a "M" a "A" and a "X"? 
SHOSANNA No need, I can manage. 
GERMAN SOLDIER Don't be ridiculous, it's my pleasure. He hands the French damsel the letters spelling MAX. 
SHOSANNA Merci. 
GERMAN SOLDIER I adore your cinema very much. 
SHOSANNA Merci. She busies herself with the marquee letters... 
GERMAN SOLDIER 
SHOSANNA 
GERMAN SOLDIER 
SHOSANNA 
GERMAN SOLDIER How does a young girl, such as yourself, own a cinema? Do to his uniform, and Shosanna's situation, all his efforts at trying to make small talk, strikes the young Jewess in hiding as a Gestapo interrogation. 
SHOSANNA My aunt left it to me. 
GERMAN SOLDIER Lucky girl. Shosanna makes no reply back. 
GERMAN SOLDIER Merci for hoisting a German night. 
SHOSANNA I don't have a choice, but your welcome. 
GERMAN SOLDIER Do you chose the German films yourself? 
SHOSANNA Oui. 
GERMAN SOLDIER Then my merci stands. I love the Refensthal mountain films, especially, "Pizu Palu". It's nice to see a French girl who's a admirer of Refensthal. 
SHOSANNA "Admire", would not be the adjective I would use to describe my feelings towards Fraulein Refensthal. 
GERMAN SOLDIER But you do admire the director. Pabst, don't you? That's why you included his name on the marquee. She climbs down from the ladder and faces the German Private. 
SHOSANNA I'm French. We respect directors in our country. 
GERMAN SOLDIER Apparently even Germans. 
SHOSANNA Even Germans. Merci for assistance, Private. Adieu. She turns to go back inside. 
GERMAN SOLDIER Your not finished? 
SHOSANNA I'll finish in the morning. She opens the door to go inside. 
GERMAN SOLDIER May I ask your name? 
SHOSANNA You wish to see my papers? She hands him her excellently forged papers. That's obviously not what he meant, but he takes them anyway to read her name. 
GOEBBELS well I must say, you've made quite a impression on our boy. Francesca interprets Goebbels German for Shosanna. 
GOEBBELS I must say fraulein, I should be rather annoyed with you. Francesca interprets.. 
GOEBBELS I arrive in France, and I wish to have lunch with my star... Francesca interprets... 
GOEBBELS Little do I know Be's become the toast of paris, and now he must find time for me. Francesca interprets... 
c9 Ã¢â¬Â¢ 
GOEBBELS People wait in line hours, day's, to see me. For the Fuhrer and Private Zoller, I wait. Francesca interprets... 
GOEBBELS So finally, I'm granted a audience with the young Private, and he spends the entire lunch speaking of you and your cinema. Francesca interprets... 
GOEBBELS So Fraulein Mimieux, let's get down to business. Private Zoller interrupts - 
FREDRICK - Heer Goebbels, I haven't informed her yet. 
GOEBBELS Unless the girls a simpleton, I'm sure she's figured it out by now, after all she does operate a cinema. Francesca, tell her. Francesca tells Shosanna in French; 
FRANCESCA What they're trying to tell you Emmanuelle, is Private Zoller has spent the last hour at lunch, trying to convince Monsieur Goebbels to abandon previous plans for Private Zollers film premier, and change the venue to your cinema. Zoller reacts. 
FRANCESCA 
(FRENCH to Zoller) What? 
FREDRICK I wanted to inform her. 
FRANCESCA Shit. I apologize Private, of course you did. 
GOEBBELS 
(GERMAN to Francesca) What's the issue? 
FRANCESCA The Private wanted to inform the mademoiselle himself. 
GOEBBELS Nonsense. Until I ask a few questions, he has nothing to inform. Let the record state, I have not agreed to a venue change. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM Duly noted. Goebbels speaks German to Shosanna; 
GOEBBELS You have opera boxes? 
SHOSANNA 
GOEBBELS 
SHOSANNA 
GOEBBELS More would be better. How many seats in your auditorium? 
SHOSANNA Three hundred and fifty. 
GOEBBELS That's almost four hundred less then The Ritz. Fredrick jumps in... 
FREDRICK But beer Goebbels, that's not such a terrible thing. You said yourself you didn't want to indulge every two faced french bourgeois taking up space currying favor. With less seat's it makes the event more exclusive. Your not trying to fill the house, their fightin g for seats. 
FREDRICK 
(CON'T) Besides, to hell with the French. This is a German night, a German event, a German celebration. This night is for you, me, the German military, the high command, their family and friends. The only people who should be allowed in the room, are people who will be moved by the exploits on screen. Goebbels listens silently, then after a bit of a pause; 
GOEBBELS I see your public speaking has improved. It appears I've created a monster. A strangely persuasive monster. When the war's over, politics awaits. Table chuckles. 
GOEBBELS Well Private, though it is true, I'm inclined to indulge you anything. I must watch a film in this young ladies cinema before I can say, yes or no. (to Shosanna) So young lady, you are to close your cinema tonight, and have a private screening me. Francesca interprets... 
GOEBBELS What German films do you have? Francesca asks.. 
SHOSANNA My cinema , on German night, tends to show older German classics. Francesca interprets... 
GOEBBELS Why not my films? Francesca asks... 
6Z. 
SHOSANNA I draw a older German audience in my cinema, that appreciate the nostalgia of the earlier time. Francesca interprets... 
GOEBBELS That's nonsense fraulein. Us Germans are looking forward, not backwards. That era of German cinema is dead. The German cinema I create, will not only be thee cinema of Europe. But the worlds only alternative to the degenerate Jewish influence of Hollywood. Fredrick Jumps in... 
FREDRICK Along with being a cinema owner, Emmanuelle is quite a formidable film critic. He chuckles, but alone. 
GOEBBELS WSo it would appear. Unfortunately for the fraulein, I've outlawed film criticism. Zoller, thinking fast, says; 
FREDRICK Why don't you screen "Lucky Kids"? I'm sure Emmanuelle hasn't seen. it. And it's so funny, I've been meaning to recommend it to her, for her German night. That's a great idea, let's watch "Lucky Kids" tonight. 
GOEBBELS Ahhh, "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids", "Lucky Kids". When all is said and done, my most purely enjoyable production. Not only that, I wouldn't be surprised, if sixty years from now, It's "Lucky Kids" that I'm the most remembered for. I know it doesn't seem like it now, but mark my words. Very well, I'll have a print sent over to the fraulein'.s cinema. We'll screen "Lucky Kids" tonight. 
SHOSANNA Oui. 
COL LANDA So Emmanuelle, explain to me how does it happen, that a young lady such as your self, comes to own a cinema? The Waiter returns, applying cream fresh to the two strudels. The S.S. Colonel looks across the table at his companion, picking up his fork, he says; 
COL LANDA After you. Shosanna takes Ã¢â¬Â¢a whip creamy bite of strudel, Landa follows her lead. 
COL LANDA 
(MOUTHFULL of pie) Success? Shosanna, mouth full of pie, indicates she approves. 
.COL LANDA Like I said, not so terrible. (Back to 
BUSINESS) So you were explaining the origin of your cinema ownership? 
SHOSANNA The cinema originally belonged to my aunt and uncle - Col Landa removes alittle black book from his pocket. 
COL LANDA - What is there names? 
SHOSANNA Jean-Pierre and Ada Mimieux. He records the names in his little book. 
COL LANDA Where are they now? 
SHOSANNA My uncle was killed during blitzkrieg. 
COL LANDA Pity... . Continue. 
SHOSANNA Aunt Ada passed away from fever last spring.' 
COL LANDA Regrettable. 
(RESPECTFUL 
PAUSE) It's come to my attention you have a negro in your employ, is that true? 
SHOSANNA Yes, he's a Frenchman. His name is Marcel. He worked with my aunt and uncle since they opened the cinema. He's the only other one who works with me. 
COL LANDA Doing what? 
SHOSANNA Projectionist. 
COL LANDA Is he any good? 
SHOSANNA The best. 
COL LANDA Actually one could see where that might be a good trade for them. Can you operate the projectors? 
SHOSANNA Of course I can. 
COL LANDA Knowing the Reich Minister as I do, I'm quite positive he wouldn't want the success or failure of his illustrious evening, dependent on the prowess of a negro. So if it comes to pass we hold this event at your venue, talented no doubt, as your negro may be, you will operate the projectors. Is that exceptable? As if she has any say. 
SHOSANNA Oui. Col Landa takes another bite of strudel, Shosanna follows suit. 
COL LANDA So it would appear our young hero is quite smitten with you? 
SHOSANNA Private Zollers feelings for me aren't of a romantic nature. 
COL LANDA Mademoiselle...? 
SHOSANNA Colonel, his feelings are not romantic. I remind him of his sister. 
COL LANDA That doesn't mean his feelings aren't romantic. 
SHOSANNA I remind him of his sister who raised him. 
COL LANDA It's sounding more and more romantic by the minute. Landa takes out a handsome looking cigarette case, with a S.S. LOGO on it. Removing on of the fags, he lights it up with a fancy S.S. gold lighter. He offers one to Shosanna. 
COL LANDA Cigarette? 
SHOSANNA No thank you. 
COL LANDA Do you smoke? 
SHOSANNA Yes. 
COL LANDA Then I insist, you must take one. There not French, there German. I hope your not nationalist about your tobacco, to me French cigarettes are a sin against nicotine. She takes one, but makes no move to light it. He inhales deep, and says; 
COL LANDA I did have some thing else I wanted to ask you, but right now, for the life of me, I can't remember what it is. Oh well, must not of been important. Col Landa stands up, throws some French francs on the table, puts on his grey S.S. cap, touches his finger to his visor, saluting Shosanna, and saying: 
COL LANDA Till tonight. And with that he's gone. Shosanna breaths a sigh of relief. The CAMERA begins to slowly lower from a MEDIUM CU to her feet ankles and floor. We see her shoes are in a puddle of urine. During her conversation and strudel with the man that exterminated her entire family, shosanna pissed herself. She drops the German cigarette in to the piss puddle by her feet. 
INT - CINEMA AUDITORIUM - NIGHT The SILVER SCREEN on screen is the German screwball comedy "LUCKY KIDS". We hear OFF SCREEN laughter at the on screen aryan antics. 
CU GOEBBELS Watching the screen, basking in his own toxic genius. 
SHOSANNA Ready. 
MARCEL Action. 
WE CUT BEFORE SHE SPEAKS TO... 
GIR 
.THE SCENE EARLIER BETWEEN MARCEL AND SHOSANNA IN THE 
LOBBY, ON THE STAIRS, TALKING ABOUT BURNING DOWN THE CINEMA. Big diffrence this time, it's in COLOR. 
MARCEL But how do we get it developed? Only a suicidal idiot like us would develop that footage. How do we get a35mm print with a soundtrack? 
SHOSANNA Do you know one person who can do both things? 
MARCEL Of course Gaspar, very nice man, took care of all the experimental filmmakers. But nobody in their right mind would strike a print of what your talking about. If the Nazi's found out, their life wouldn't be worth this. He snaps his fingers. 
SHOSANNA In a wolf fight, you ether eat the wolf, or the wolf eats you. If we're going to obliterate the Nazi's, we have to use their tactics. 
MARCEL What does that mean? 
SHOSANNA We find somebody who can develop and process a35mm print. And we make them do it, or we kill them. Once we tell them what we want to do, if they refuse, we have to kill them anyway, or they'll turn us in. 
MARCEL Would you do that? 
SHOSANNA Like that. Snaps her fingers. 
?S, 
INT - SMALL FILM PROCESSING LAB- LATE NIGHT A old mom and pop film processing lab circa the Thirties. Late late at night. GASPAR, the fatherly figure of all the experimental French filmmakers in the decade before German rule, takes a SAVAGE BEATING at the hands of his friend Marcel. Shosanna watches, pitiless. 
SHOSANNA Bring that fucker over here! Put his head down on that table. Marcel, holds his arm behind him, as he forces his head flat against the table top. Shosanna brings a HATCHET DOWN DEEP into the table, just by his face. 
SHOSANNA You ether do what the fuck we tell you to, or I'll bury this axe in your collaborating skull. 
GASPAR I'm not a collaborator! 
SHOSANNA Then prove it! Or does your manhood go no deeper, then standing to piss? Marcel, does his wife, and children know you? 
MARCEL Oui. 
SHOSANNA Then after we kill this dog for Germans, we'll go and silence them. She lifts up the hatchet, raises it high... 
SHOSANNA Prepare to die, collaborator fucker! 
CUT TO 
GASPAR hands the couple a SMALL SILVER CAN OF 35mm FILM. Outside the shop window, it's morning. 
INT - PROJECTION BOOTH- WE SEE the five heavy silver film cans of Fredrick Zollers life story "Nations Pride"(clearly marked) on the floor of the projection booth. The can for REEL 4is open and empty. Shosanna's at the editing bench, REEL 4, is up on the rewinds... Shosanna SPLICES her and Marcels footage into REEL 4 of Fredricks film. Rewinds it, puts it back in the can, and puts a piece of RED TAPE on REEL 4 CAN. She walks out of the booth, turning off the lights behind her, PLUNGING THE SCREEN INTO DARKNESS. 
BLACK FRAME 
FROM BLACK DISSOLVE TO 
EXT - LA LOUISIANE (TAVERN) - NIGHT We see a small basement tavern, with a old rustic sign out front that reads, "La Louisiane". 
A SUBTITLE APPEARS: "The Village of 
NADINE, FRANCE" TWO SHOT LT.HICOX and LT.ALDO RAINE Aldo is dressed like a French civilian. Hicox is dressed in a German grey S.S. Cap't uniform. They look out of a window, in a apartment, in the village of Nadine, overlooking the tavern. 
LT.ALDO You didn't say the goddamn rendez-vous was in a fuckin basement. 
LT.HICOX I didn't know. 
LT.ALDO You said it was in a tavern? 
LT.HICOX it is a tavern. 
LT.ALDO Yeah, in a basement. You know, fightin in a basement offers a lot of difficulties, number one being, your fighting in a basement. Wilhelm Wicki, joins the SHOT, dressed in a German S.S. Lieutenant uniform. 
WICKI What if we go in there, and she's not even there? 
LT.HICOX We wait. Don't worry, she's a British spy, she'll make the rendez-vous. WE SEE the other Basterds, dressed in French civilian clothes, are in the room as well, they are, Donowitz, Hirschberg, and Utivich. And in the back of the room, dressed in the grey uniform of a S.S. Lieutenant, Hugo Stiglitz sits off by himself, sharpening his S.S. DAGGER on his leather belt looped around his boot. Anybody not in the scene from the Basterds opening chapter, is dead. Lt.Hicox watches Stiglitz off by himself on the other side of the room, SHARPENS his dagger menacingly. .Stiglitz is fucking werid... Lt.Hicox approaches Stiglitz... 
LT.NICOX Stiglitz, right? 
STIGLITZ That's right, sir. He continues bringing the blades edge, up, then, down on the leather strap. 
LT.HICOX I hear your pretty good with that? Meaning the blade. Stiglitz doesn't answer. 
LT.HICOX You know, we're not looking for trouble, right now. We're simply making contact with our agent. Should be uneventful. However, on the off chance I'm wrong, and things prove eventful. I need to know, we can all remain calm. 
BRIDGET Well, yes they did, but it's not really that difficult. 
SGT.POLA NEGRI Do one for us. The Tableheartily agrees. Bridget looks directly at the Master Sgt, and does a perfect, and perfectly funny, Double Take. The Table loves it. 
q3. 
MATA HARI My turn, I want to try. Mata Hari, looks directly at Beethoven, and does a Double Take. 
EDGER WALLACE I want to try. He does. Soon the whole Table is doing dueling Double Takes. 
HICOX - WICKI - STIGLITZ watch the table do dueling Double Takes. Obviously, they don't understand. 
THEN... .Bridget Von Hammersmark rises, and excuses herself from the Table. She removes the card stuck in her fedora, looking at the name Gengus Khaun for the first time. 
BRIDGET Gengus Khaun! I would never of gotten that. She walks over, and joins the masquerading Germans table, the Gentlemen rise. She greets each warmly with a french cheek kiss, as if she knows them well. They all take a seat. The two Basterds, and one Brit, drink Whiskey. The taverns PROPRIETOR, a older, big bellyed Frenchman named EARL, comes over to the table, and pours more champagne into Bridget's Champagne glass. He leaves, returning back behind the bar, with the YOUNG FRENCH BARMAID, the only other person in the establishment. Obviously, they speak GERMAN, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH; 
LT.HICOX I thought this place was suppose to have more French then Germans? 
BRIDGET Normally that's true. The Sgt over there's wife, just had a baby. His commanding officer gave him, and his mates the night off to celebrate. 
WICXI We should leave. 
BRIDGET F No, we should stay. For one drink at least. I've been waiting for you in a bar, it would look strange if we left before we had a drink. 
LT.HICOX She's right, just be calm, and enjoy your booze. 
BACK TO THE GERMAN TABLE The French Barmaid, has taken Bridget's place in the rousing, rowdy game. She tells them, her person must be French, or she won't know them. Winnetou thinks for a moment, then writes a name on a card. The Barmaid puts it on her forehead, It says; 
NAPOLEON. The Germans all laugh. 
BACK TO THE BASTERDS TABLE 
BRIDGET There's been some new developments. The cinema venue has changed. 
LT.HICOX Why? 
BRIDGET No one knows. But that in itself shouldn't be a problem. The cinema it's been changed to is considerably smaller then The Ritz. So whatever materials you brought for The Ritz, should be doubly effective here. Now this next piece of information is colossal, try not to over react. The Fubrer, will be attending tomorrow. Hugo Stiglitz does a SPIT TAKE. Bridget's eyes bore holes in him. 
BACK TO THE REAL GERMANS They see Hugo do the spit take, and burst out laughing. Keeping it up, they begin to do dueling spit takes, like they did dueling double takes earlier. Needless to say, they all get wet. 
BACK TO BASTERDS 
BRIDGET (To Hicox) You'll be going as Ernst Schuller. You'll say your a associate producer on Riefenstahl's "Tiefland". It's the one German production not under Goebbels control, and Leni wouldn't be caught dead at a Goebbels film affair. 
BACK TO REAL GERMAN TABLE Master Sgt.Pola Negri, drinks his beer, as he looks over, dreamily, at Bridget Von Hammersmark at the other table. 
BACK TO BASTERDS We See in Bridget continues to brief Hicox on his identity. the B.G., the German Master Sgt stand up from his table, and head toward Fraulein Von Bammersmark. 
BRIDGET .the films gone through many delays, and Leni's heath is deteriorating, so if you have to speak... Hicox, seeing the German Master Sgt approach, signals for her to cool it. 
SGT.POLA NEGRI Frau Von Hammersmark, I was just thinking, could you sign a autograph to my son on his birthday? 
BRIDGET I'd love to Wilhelm. (To the Table) This handsome happy Sgt, just became a father today. The Pretend Officers offer congratulations to the Sgt. The German Master Sgt, CLICKS his heels, and bows before his superior officers. 
SGT.POLA NEGRI Thank you, heil Hitler. He raises his hand .... as do the seated phony officers; "Heil Hitler". As she takes a rather fancy fountain pen from her clutch.. 
BRIDGET So Wilhelm, do you know the name of this progeny yet? 
SGT.POLA NEGRI I most certainly do, fraulein. His name is Maximilian. Even the slightly psychotic Stiglitz, likes this German Sgt. 
STIGLITZ Wonderful name, Sgt. 
SGT.POLA NEGRI Thank you, Lieutenant. When he's old enough to ride a bicycle, I will buy him a blue one. And I will paint on the side "The Blue Max". He thrusts out his beer stein, for the officers to cheers. They do. Bridget finishes signing her autograph, with a big flourish. 
BRIDGET There you go. But wait, I'm not finished yet. She reaches into her clutch, and pulls out some lipstick. Applies some ruby red color to her lips, and then kisses the napkin, leaving a big red lip print. Then hands the treasured item to the young father. 
BRIDGET Nothing but the best for little Maximilian. 
SGT.POLA NEGRI Thank you fraulein, thank you. Max may not know who you are now. But he will. I will show him all of your movies. He will grow up with your films, and this napkin on his wall. Then, to the whole tavern... 
SGT.POLA NEGRI I purpose a toast to the greatest actress in Germany! There is no Dietrich, there is no Riefenstahl, only Von Hammersmark! The whole room toasts. This would be a good time for the German Sgt to go back to his table, and his men. And he almost does.... but... since he is drunk, and star struck, he out wears his welcome. 
SGT.POLA NEGRI So, Frau Von Hammersmark, what brings you to France? 
Feeling any good Nazi officer's patience would of been exhausted long ago, Lt.Hicox butts in. 
LT.HICOX None of your business,Sgt. You might not have worn out your welcome with the fraulein, with your drunken boorish behavior, but you have wore out your welcome with me. The Table of game playing Soldiers, hear this, and get quiet. 
LT.HICOX Might I remind you Sgt.,your a enlisted man. This is a officers table. I suggest you stop pestering the fraulein, and rejoin your table. The German Master Sgt., looks quizzically at the officer. 
SGT.POLA NEGRI Excuse me Cap't, but your accent is is very unusual. The whole room pauses-for different reasons... 
SGT.POLA NEGRI Where are you from? A silent moment passes between the two tables, then the two German born impostors spring into action. 
BRIDGET okay, one game. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM 
WUNDERBAR The Major borrows five cards from the other table, and lays them out in front of Bridget and the officers. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM So the object of the game, is to write the name of a famous person on your card. Real or fictitious, doesn't matter. For instance, you could write Confucius or Fu Manchu. (He SNAPS his 
FINGERS) Eric' More pens. (Back to players) And they must be famous. No Aunt Inga's. When you finish writing, put the card face down on the table, and move it to the person to your left. The person to your right, will move their card in front of you. You pick up the card without looking at it, lick the back, and stick it on your forehead like so. He demonstrates. 
)oz. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM 
(CON'T) And in ten yes or no questions, you must guess who you are... As Major Hellstrom finishes explaining the finer points of the game, The CAMERA PANS OFF HIM, and BEGINS SLOWLY ZOOMING INTO STIGLITZ. The Majors dialogue begins to FADE AWAY. Untill we're in a SPAGHETTI WESTERN FLASHBACK. Which is RED FILTERED FOOTAGE of Hugo being savagely WHIPPED by somebody wearing a GESTAPO UNIFORM, SUPERIMPOSED over his CLOSE UP. The Flashback disappears. It's driving Stiglitz crazy, being this close to a Gestapo uniform, and not plunging a knife into it. The Majors Voice comes back on the soundtrack. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM .So let's give it a try, shall we? Everybody write your names. The Five players write their names... Then move their cards to the right... Everybody sticks their cards on their forehead...

KONG POLO DRUMMOND HELM PABST 
MAJ.KING KONG I'll start, give you the idea. Am I German? They laugh. 
BRIDGET No. 
MAJ.KING KONG Am I a American? They laugh - but then Wicki says; 
WICKI Wait a minute, he goes to 
BRIDGET Don't be ridiculous, obviously he wasn't born in America. 
MAJ.KING KONG So... . I visited America, aye? The Table says; "Yes". 
MAJ.KING KONG Was this vist...fortuitous? 
WICKI Not for you. 
MAJ.KING KONG .Bummm. My native land, is it what one would call, exotic? The Table confers, and decides, yes it is exotic. 
MAJ.KING KONG Hummmm. That could be ether a reference to the jungle, or the Orient. I'm going to let my first instinct take over, and ask, am I from the jungle? The Tablesays; "Yes you are". 
MAJ.KING KONG Now gentlemen, around this time you could ask, weather your real or fictitious. I however, think that's too easy, so I won't ask that, yet. Okay, my native land is the jungle? I visited America, but my visit was not fortuitous to me, but the implication is that it was to somebody else. When I went from the jungle to America,... .Did I go by boat? "Yes". 
MAJ.KING KONG Did I go against my will? "Yes". 
MAJ.KING KONG On this boat ride, ... . Was I in chains? 
"YESIS 
MAJ.KING KONG When I arrived in America,...Was I displayed in chains? "Yes". 
MAJ.KING KONG Am I the story of the Negro in America? The Table says, "No". 
MAJ.KING KONG Well then I must be King Kong. Be throws the card on the table. They applaud him. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM Nov since I answered correctly, you all need to finnish your drinks. The three counterfeit Nazi's knock back their whiskey. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM Now, who's next? 
LT.HICOX Major, I don't mean to be rude. But the four of us are very good friends. And the four of us haven't seen each other in quite a while. So... Major, I'm afraid, you are intruding. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM I beg to differ Cap't. It's only if the fraulein considers my presence a intrusion, that I become a intruder. How about it fraulein? Am I intruding? 
BRIDGET Of course not, Major. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM I didn't think so. It's simply the young Cap't is immune to my charms. The Table's not sure what to do, is this a confrontation? Then, the Major laughs. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM I'm just joking, of course I'm intruding. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM Allow me to refill your glasses gentlemen, and I will bid you and the fraulein adieu. (Leaning in) Eric has a bottle of thirty-three year old single malt scotch whisky from the Scottish highlands. What do you say gentlemen? 
LT.HICOX Your most gracious, sir. 
MAJOR HELLSTROM Eric, the thirty-three, and new glasses! You don't want to contaminate the thirty- three with the swill you were drinking. 
ERIC How many glasses? 
LT.HICOX Five glasses. 
GERMAN SGT You outside! Who are you? British, American, what? Aldo's Voice YELLS down the hole; 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Were American's 1 What are you? 
GERMAN SGT I'm a German you idiot! 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) You speak English pretty good for a German! 
GERMAN SGT I agree! So let's talk! 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Okay, talk! 
GERMAN SGT I'm a father! My baby was born today in Frankfurt! Five hours ago! His name is Max! We were in here drinking and celebrating! They're the ones that came in shooting and killing! It's not my fault! 
Ito. 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Okay, okay, it wasn't your fault! What's your name soldier? 
GERMAN SGT Wilhelm! 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) That's the same name as one of the guys you just killed! 
WILHELM They attacked us! 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Okay Wilhelm... .is anybody alive on our side? 
WILHELM No! We hear a VOICE OFF SCREEN, yell out; 
BRIDGET'S VOICE(OS) I'm alive! Wilhelm spins in the direction of the voice. 
STILL 
R On the floor, with a bullet in her BLOODY LEG, lies the alive Bridget Von Hammersmark. The German Sgt points the muzzle of the machine gunn at the German celebrity; with hate in his eyes. 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Who's that? 
WILHELM (To BRIDGET, 
LOW) Make a sound whore, and I spit! Meaning the muzzle. 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Wilhelm, who is that? 
WILHELM is the girl on your side? Pause. 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Which girl? 
WILHELM 1 Who do you think, Von Hammersmark! 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Yeah, she's oar's! 
WILHELM (To Bridget LOW in GERMAN) I thought so. So you run with the American's now, huh? Now times are bad? 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Is she okay? 
WILHELM (To Bridget LOW in GERMAN) You despicable traitor. (To Aldo) She's been shot, but she's alive. (To Bridget LOW in GERMAN) For now. We hear The Basterds Curse their luck Off Screen. 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Okay Wilhelm, what'd ya say we make a deal? 
WILHELM What's your name? 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Aldo. Wilhelm, can I call yap Willi? 
WILHELM Yes. 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) So Willi, you know we could lob three or four or five or six grenades down there, and your little war story ends here. But good fer you, bad fer her, you die, she dies. So what say we make a swap? 
WILLI Keep talking? 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Okay, Willi here's my deal! You let me and one of my men come down to take the girl away! And we take the girl, and leave! That simple, Willi! You go your way, we go ours! And little Max, gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy! So what'ya say, Willi, we got a deal? Willi thinks... Bridget watches Willi think... 
WILLI Aldo? 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) I'm here Willi! 
WILLI I want to trust you.... But howcanI? 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) What choice ya got? 
WILLI I could kill the girl! 
ALDO'S VOICE(OS) Well now, Willi, that's true enough. But something you need to know, so you don't get the wrong idea. Ain't none of us give a fuck bout that girl. But, admittedly, if you kill her, it would fuck up our plans. But you'll be dead by then anyway, so what'd you care? And lets not forget that little gatzenjammer Max, growin up without a pop. So in the spirit of gettin you home to him, we got a deal, Willi? 
WILLI Okay Aldo, I'm going to trust you! Come down, no guns! Aldo and Hirschberg come down the stairs, showing open hands. Willi keeps his machine gunn trained on them. Aldo with his hands up, says; 
SGT.DONOWITZ 
(ENGLISH) BANG BANG - in the leg, understand! The Old Man nods his head yes. 
OLD MAN 
(FRENCH) But I'm a veterinarian ...animals... I take care of animals... Bridget screams from the table... 
BRIDGET 
(ENGLISH) He's a fucking veterinarian you imbecile! 
SGT.DONOWITZ 
I It's still a doctor. If he can get a bullet out of a cow, he can get a bullet outta you. 
LT.ALDO Right now, we just need morphine. Donny yells at the Old Man; 
SGT.DONOWITZ Morphine! We need morphine! The Old Man tries to explain in French, that he's not a human doctor... 
WHEN... ..Donny takes the 45. and SHOOTS one of the DOGS in the cages. Everybody jumps. Donny SCREAMS at the Old Man; 
SGT.DONOWITZ 
MORPHINE!!! 
BANG He SHOOTS another dog... 
SGT.DONOWITZ 
MOREPHINE!!! The Old Man begs him to stop, and goes to get the morphine. 
CUT TO The BODY of Gestapo Major DEITER HELLSTROM dead on the floor. 
INT - LA LOUISTANE- NIGHT Were back in the basement tavern. Colonel Hans Landa stands over the corpse. He moves over to the next corpse, a smile breaks out on his face. He says in GERMAN SUBTITLED into ENGLISH; 
COL.LANDA Ahhh Hugo, you've moved up in the world I see. Lieutenant. And with your record of insubordination. Truly remarkable. 
I 
A Nazi soldier named HERRMAN, joins the S.S. Officer. 
COL.LANDA And that ones... (Pointing at 
WICKI) .name is Weiheim Wicki. Bets Austrian born jew, who immigrated to the United States when things began turning sour for the Israelites. They are the two German born members of The Basterds. They've been known to don german uniforms, to ambush squads. 
FLASH ON Three Nazi Soldiers walking towards a company of other German Soldiers. The Three Soldiers backs are to us. Dried bloody bullet holes cover the backs of the three uniforms. The SGT of the German company, yells to the trio; 
SGT.GERMAN COMPANY What brings you all the way out here? The TRIO MOW DOWN the GERMAN COMPANY with their machine gunns. 
BACK TO LANDA 
COL LANDA But that doesnt look like this. This is odd. Looking down he see's something... .bending down, he examines fraulein von Hammersmarks two pretty dress shoes lying on the floor. One shoe is covered in blood. The other, while blood speckled, is fairly clean. Picking up the clean shoe, and holding it in his hand. 
COL.LANDA It would appear somebodies missing. Somebody fashionable. A OFF SCREEN SOLDIER'S VOICE cries out; 
SOLDIERS VOICE(OS) Col, this ones still alive! We follow Hans to the spot on the floor where Sgt.Willi lies. He's shot in the chest, but it looks like Max's daddy is still alive. 
INT - EXAMINING ROOM -ÃÂ° NIGHT Bridget on the examining table, post morphine shot. The other Basterds in the room watch Aldo interrogate the German lady. 
LT.ALDO Now 'fore we yank that slug outta ya, you need to answer a few questions 
BRIDGET Few questions about what? 
LT.ALDO About I got three men dead back there, and why don't you try tellin us what the fuck happened? 
BRIDGET The British officer blew his German act, and a Gestapo Major saw it. 
LT.ALDO 'fore we get into who shot John, why did you invite my men to a rendez-vous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis? 
BRIDGET I can see, since you didn't see what happened inside, the Nazi's being there must look odd. 
LT.ALDO Yeah, we gotta word for that kinda odd in English, it's called, suspicious. 
BRI DGET Don't let your imagination get the better of you, Lieutenant. You met the sergeant, Willi. He had a baby tonight. His commanding officer gave him and his friends the night off to celebrate. The Germans being there was just a tragic coincidence. Aldo thinks for a moment... 
LT. ALDO Okay, I'll buy that. He was ether there with his men waiting for us, or he was there celebrating his sons birthday, he wasn't doin both. 
LT.ALDO How did the shootin start? 
BRIDGET The English man, gave himself away. 
LT. ALDO How did he do that? 
LT. ALDO it sounds like shit, but what else we gonna do, go home? 
BRIDGET No, it's good. If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building. (Change tone) So, who does what? 
LT.ALDO Well I speak the most Italian, so I'll be your escort. Donowitz speaks the second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman. And Hirschberg third most, so he'll be Donnys assistant. 
HIRSCHBERG I don't speak Italian. 
LT. ALDO Like I said, third best. Just keep your fuckin mouth shut. In fact why don't you start practising, right now. 
BRIDGET (Meaning Utivich) What about the little one? 
UTIVICH Do you mean me? 
BRIDGET I didn't mean any offence. 
UTIVICH None taken you German cunt. 
LT.ALDO Utivich is the chauffeur.

CHAPTER TITLE APPEARS: 
CHAPTER FIVE 
"REVENGE OF THE GIANT FACE" 
FADE OFF 
INT - SHOSANNAS AND MARCELS LIVING QUARTERS - NIGHT We're in Shosannas and Marcels living quarters, above the cinema. We've never been in here before. 
A SUBTITLE APPEARS ON SCREEN: 
NIGHT OF "NATION'S PRIDE" PREMIERE She's standing before a full length mirror, in a real attractive Forties style dress for the premiere. She's stunning. This is the first time in her life she's had the opportunity, or the occasion to wear something like this. Since she knows this is the last night of her life, no time like the present. SOUNDS of the hub-bub of the premiere, not to mention the German brass band that's blaring Third Reich Marches, can be heard coming from below. Shosanna walks to her apartment window, and looks down at the Germatic miasma below. SHOSANNAS POV: WE SEE all the pageantry below. Tons of SPECTATORS. Tons of guests dressed in Nazi uniforms, tuxedos, and female finery, walking up the long red carpet(with a big Swastika in the middle, naturally) leading into Shosannas cinema. The German brass band omm-pa-pa-ing away. German Radio and Film crews covering the event for the fatherland back home. And of course, MANY GERMAN SOLDIERS providing security for this joyous Germatic occasion. Shosanna COUGHS up a lugi, and HOCKS it. A GERMAN S.S. GENERAL, being interviewed by a RADIO COMMENTATOR, the lugi HITS him right on his bald head. Shosanna goes back to the full length mirror, places a very fashionable Forties style hat on her head, then lowers the period style black fish net veil over her face. She takes out a small GUN, and puts it in the pocket of her dress., and it's on. She exits the apartment door, to join the premiere. From this point on, there's no turning back, it's all the way baby, all the fucking way! 
INT - CINEMA STAIRWELL - NIGHT The stairwell in the building that connects the living quarters, with the cinema. She walks down the stairs, goes through a door that puts her next to the projection booth door. She takes out a key and opens it. 
INT - PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT Marcels prepping the film reels for tonight. The five silver metal film cans that carry one 35mm reel of film each are laid out. The cans for reels one and two are empty. Cans for reel three, our specially marked can for reel four, and can for reel five(which should never see the light of a projector) lie in wait. Shosanna, looking like a Forties movie star, enters the projection booth. The scene in FRENCH SUBTITLED in ENGLISH; 
MARCEL Ooh lala, Danielle Darrieux, this is so exciting. Pleased to meet you. 
SHOSANNA Shut up fool. Marcel lifts up the veil covering her face, and their lips meet. 
SHOSANNA Cheeky black bugger. I have to go down and socialize with these Hun pigs. Let's go over it again? 
MARCEL Reel one is on the first projector. Reel two is on the second. Three and four are ready to go. 
SHOSANNA Okay, the big sniper battle in the film begins around the middle of the third reel. Our film, comes on in the forth reel, so Somewhere towards the end of the third reel, go down and lock the doors of the auditorium. Then take your place behind the screen, and wait for my CUE, when I give it to you, BURN IT DOWN! 
INT - CINEMA LOBBY - NIGHT The pageantry of the evening is in full swing, as all the German beautiful people, enter the cinema. They mingle in the swastika covered, greek nude statue peppered lobby. Nazi Military Commanders, High Ranking Party Officials, and German Celebrities(Emil tannings, Veit Harlin), hob knob and drink Champagne from passing WAITERS who carry glasses on silver trays. We see Shosanna enter from the area at the top of the big staircase in the lobby that overlooks the lobby parlor entrance. She descends the staircase, and busies herself with theatre stuff. At the top of the staircase, looking down at the master race in all there finery, is Colonel Hans Landa, dressed in his finest SS Uniform, smoking on his Calabash. 
CAMERA FRAME directly behind him. On the right side, we see the figure of Col.Landa, from behind, watching the guests entering the cinema. On the left side of frame, is the cinema entrance, from a looking down perspective of the guests entering the building. 
THEN... .A THINK BUBBLE, like in a comic book, appears on the left side of frame, obscuring the cinema entrance. Inside of Landas think bubble, a little scene plays out. 
THINK BUBBLE Inside a hospital room filled with DOCTORS, NURSES, and a PATIENT in a hospital bed. Then Col.Landa enters the room, and screams at everybody; 
COL.LANDA I want everybody out of this room! They start to leave. 
COL.LANDA That means now, goddamnit! They RUSH OUT. He walks over to the Patient in the hospital bed, Its none other then SGT.WILLI, and yes, he's still alive. Landa pulls up a chair next to the bed, sits down. 
COL.LANDA Can you speak, Sgt? 
SGT.DONOWITZ Enzo Gorlomi. 
COL.LANDA 
(ITALIAN) Again... .? 
SGT.DONOWITZ Gorlomi. 
COL.LANDA 
(ITALIAN) One more time, but let me really hear the music in it. 
SGT.DONOWITZ 
(HAMMY ITALIAN) Gorlomi. Now to Hirschberg... 
COL.LANDA 
(ITALIAN) And you? Then Hischberg breaks out the best Italian accent of the 
GROUP; 
HIRSCHBERG Dominick Decocco. 
COL.LANDA Dominick Decocco? 
HIRSCHBERG Dominick Decocco. 
COL.LANDA Bravo... . Bravo. 
BRIDGET 
(GERMAN) Well, my two cameraman friends need to find there seats. Col.Landa stops a WAITER with a tray of champagne glasses. 
COL.LANDA 
(GERMAN) Not so fast, lets enjoy some champagne. Everyone gets a glass. 
COL.LANDA 
(FRENCH) - Oh, Mademoiselle Mimieux, please join us, I have some friends I'd like you to meet. Shosanna joins the circle, and is handed a champagne glass. This is the first moment The Basterds are aware of Shosanna. 
COL.LANDA 
(FRENCH) May I say Mademoiselle, you look divine. 
SHOSANNA 
(FRENCH) Merci'. 
COL.LANDA 
(GERMAN) This lovely young lady, is Mademoiselle Emmanuelle Mimieux, this is her cinema, and she is our hostess for the evening. 
(FRENCH) And Mademoiselle, this battered, broken, and none worse for the wear German goddess, is Bridget Von Hammersmark. 
1 3 W. 
BRIDGET Bonjour. 
SHOSANNA Bon jour. 
BRIDGET 
(FRENCH) I'm afraid my companions don't speak any French, there Italian. This is Antonino, Enzo, and Dominick. All three smile goofy spaghetti bender smiles. 
COL.LANDA 
(FRENCH) Actually fraulein Von Hammersmarks Italian associates, need help finding there seats. Perhaps Mademoiselle Mimieux would be so kind to escort them? 
SHOSANNA 
(FRENCH) It would be my pleasure. Let me see your tickets? Donny hands her two tickets. She indicates for them to follow her. Donny and Hirschberg both exchange one last look with Aldo, then follow the young french girl into the auditorium. 
INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT The cinema auditorium is filling up quickly with grey and black uniforms. Shosanna finds the two counterfeit Italians their seats. After she points out their seats, she turns to leave... Hirschberg... .reaches out and grabs her wrist. He looks her in the face, and filled with tremendous guilt, because if he's successful tonight he's going to blow this cute French girl to smithereens, he says; 
HIRSCHBERG Grazie. 
13r. The cute French Girl looks back at the goofy looking Italian boy with slicked back hair, that makes him look kind of Jewish, with tremendous guilt, knowing if she is successful tonight, she's going to burn him alive, and says; 
SHOSANNA Prego. 
BACK TO LOBBY They begin flicking the lights on and off. A GERMAN SOLDIER YELLS in GERMAN in the lobby; 
INT - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT ,including Donowitz and Hirschberg, sitting amongst the master race, waiting for showtime. 
EXT - CINEMA - NIGHT The Six Nazi Soldiers, hustle the hooded Aldo, down the red carpet, then into the alley besides the cinema. Aldo's put up against a wall. Inside the black hood, he's SCREAMING every insulting thing about Germany, Germans, German food, German shepherd... anything. 
COL.LANDA'S VOICE(OS) Shut up! The faceless black hood does. Col.Landa, now standing directly in front of his hooded prisoner, says in ENGLISH; 
COL.LANDA As Stanley said to Livingston; Lt.Aldo Raine, I presume? 
I 'to. 
LT. ALDO Hans Landa? 
COL.LANDA You've had a nice long run, Aldo. Alas, your now in the hands of the SS. My hands to be exact. And they've been waiting along time, to touch you. He reaches out with his finger, and lightly touches Aldo's face right in the middle of the hood. Aldo's head VIOLENTLY FLINCHES. 
COL.LANDA Caught ya flinching. In German, he orders the men put Aldo in the back of a truck. Aldo, bound, and bagged, is put in the truck. Also in the truck is Utivich, wearing a makeshift chauffeurs uniform, bound, and bagged like the Lieutenant. The Truck drives off. Col.Landa turns around, and SEES FROM A DISTANCE, Hitlers motorcade pull up to the cinema.. Then the Fuhrer, Goebbels, Francesca, and the rest of the entourage, make there way down the red carpet into the cinema. Landa smiles. 
EXT TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT We see the truck leaving the city of Paris, under the veil of night. We also seem to be leaving the drama of Operation Kino. 
INT - TRUCK(MOVING) - NIGHT The two hooded prisoners, bounce along in the back of the truck. Utivich, is crying inside his hood. 
LT.ALDO Utivich? 
UTIVICH Is that you Lieutenant? 
LT. ALDO Yep. 
lyl. 
UTIVIC}I Do you know what happened to Donny? Hirchberg? The woman? 
LT.ALDO No I do not. 
UTIVICH Lieutenant, sorry I'm crying. 
LT. ALDO Nothin to be sorry about, son. This bag, get to anyone. 
UTIVICH Not exactly John Wayne, am I? 
LT.ALDO John Waynes a pampered movie star. He burst into tears, if his cook, busts his yoke at breakfast. Just try puttin a bag over his head, and hear what kinda sounds he makes. Utivich, giggles through the tears. 
LT.ALDO I just want you to know, son, I was real proud of you tonight. Learnin how to drive overnight. Driving in that Limo line. You was in the hot seat, son, and you stood up real good. Utivich Cries LOUDER. Aldo takes his foot, finds Utivichs foot, and places his foot on top. The TOUCH has a slight calming effect on Utivich. In the darkness, Utivich has reclaimed his dignity. 
EXT- COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT The truck pulls up to a small tavern outside of Paris(not La Louisaiane), The two hooded prisoners, are walked inside the establishment. 
INT - COUNTRY TAVERN - NIGHT The hooded men are lead into the closed for business, but open for something else, rustic tavern. 
0The Nazi Guards, unlock the handcuff, then sit them down inchairs. Then, simultaneously, the hoods are YANKED OFF. The two prisoners, are seated at a table, in what they can now see, is a rustic tavern. On the table is one telephone, one bottle of Chianti, and three glasses. And on the opposite end of the table, sits Colonel Hans Landa. A NAZI SOLDIER sits posted at  a impressive looking two way radio set up in the tavern. Colonel Lands starts in right away at the two baffled, discombobulated American soldiers. They will only speak ENGLISH in the scene. 
COL.LANDA Italian? Really? 
(BEAT) What could you have possibly been thinking? 
LT. ALDO Well, I speak alittle Italian - 
COL.LANDA I speak a little Tagalog, but I wouldn't begin to presume I could pass for Filipino. Don't get me wrong, I understand you were in a pickle, what with you losing your Germans. And I have nothing but admiration for improvisation. Still.... Chico Marx is more convincing. if the three of you had shown up to the premiere dressed in womans attire, it would have been more convincing. Landas eyes go to the Two Nazi Guards behind the prisoners. 
COL.LANDA 
(GERMAN) You may leave us. But stay alert outside. They exit, leaving the Colonel, the Lieutenant, the Private and a German Radio Man in the corner. 
COL.LANDA So your Aldo the Apache? 
LT. ALDO So your The Jew Hunter? 
COL.LANDA Jew Hunter, (pfuit), I'm a detective. A damn good detective. Finding people is my specialty. So naturally, I worked for the Nazi's finding people. And yes, some of them were Jews. But Jew Hunter? Just the name that stuck. 
UTIVICH Well you do hafts admit, it is catchy. 
COL.LANDA Do you control the nicknames, your enemies bestow on you? Aldo the Apache and The Little Man? 
UTIVICH What do you mean, The Little Man? 
COL.LANDA The Germans nickname for you. 
UTIVICH The Germans nickname for me is, The Little Man? 
COL.LANDA Or "The Little One, ether one means you. And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life. I mean, your a little fellow. But not circus midget little, as your reputation would suggest. 
LT.ALDO Where is my men? Where is Bridget Von Hammersmark? 
COL.LANDA Bridget Von Hammersmark. Oh I'm sure she's in whatever, big bubbling cesspool in hell, the devil reserves for traitors of her ilk. 
COL. LANDA 
CHEERS. 
BACK TO THE PREMIERE 
WE CUT TO THE B/W FILM ON SCREEN. Fredrick Zoller, playing himself, is in a ornamental tower in a Russian village, picking off RUSSIAN SOLDIER's below. 
A RUSSIAN GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY peering at the German Private through binoculars. He lowers the long range glasses, and confers with one of his OFFICERS. 
GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY 
(RUSSIAN) What's the death toll? 
OFFICER 
(RUSSIAN) 47, so far. 
WE HEAR A SHOT. 
OFFICER 
(RUSSIAN) 48. General, I implore you, we must destroy that tower! 
GENERAL KCHOVLANSKEY 
(RUSSIAN) That tower is one of the oldest, and most beautiful structures in Russia. I won't be responsible for turning a thousand years of history into dust! A BRAVE RUSSIAN SOLDIER, tries to run between two buildings. Zoller, gets him. Then proceeds to pick him apart, one single bullet at a time. 
IL 
ISO. 
SHOSANNA IN PROJECTION BOOTH She removes "REEL 4" (The Special Shosanna Reel), and prepares it on the 2nd Projector. Reel3, on the first Projector, playing now, is halfway through. In a few short minutes, it's going to be show time. Marcel says to Shosanna in FRENCH, SUBTITLED in ENGLISH; 
MARCEL It's time. I should go lock the auditorium, and take my place behind the screen. This is the last time they will ever see each other, too much to say. He holds her in his arms and lays a one kiss before I die wet one on her. 
DONOWITZ AND HIRSCHBERG sit in their seats watching the movie, surrounded by DRESS UNIFORM NAZI'S. They've developed a dopey way of communicating with each other in this hostel environment. Basically, speaking English like it were gibberish Italian. They say English words, only adding a "I", or a "A", or a "O", to the end of it. And saying it in a exaggerated Italian accent, complete with pantomimes. Donowitz leans into Hirschberg, and says in a wispier; They speak in ITALIA-ISH SUBTITLED into ENGLISH; 
SGT.DONOWITZ 
(ITALIA-ISH) I-a Go-a Toilet-a, Set-ta Boom-a. (I go to the toilet and set the bomb) When-a I-a Go-a, you-a Set-ta Boom-a. (When I go, you set your bomb) Hirschberg indicates/pantomimes, he can't set his bomb surrounded by all these Nazi's. Donowitz, pantomimes crossing his legs, setting bomb on ankle in his seat. Then getting up, and dropping it in the back of the auditorium, in the dark. Hirschberg doesn't get it. 
HIRSCHBERG What-a? (What?) Donny pantomimes again, more exaggerated, and with less patience. 
HIRSCHBERG Affirm-ato, affirm-ato. (Affirmative, affirmative) 
SGT.DONOWITZ They-o Look-o Screen-a, Not-o You-a. (They're looking at the screen, not you.) 
HIRSCHBERG Fantastic-o. 
(FANTASTIC) 
SGT.DONOWITZ After-teri, Set-ta, Five-o Moment-o (Pointing to 
WATCH) You-a, Pphisst. (After you set the bomb, wait five minutes, and get out of here) 
HIRSCHBERG What-o? (What?) 
SGT.DONOWITZ Confuse-i, confuss-i, confuss-i. (Confused, confused, confused.) What-a, and-o what-o, same-o? (I thought "What-a" meat "What", does "What-O" mean "What", as well?) 
HIRSCHBERG Oh-o, sorr-o, I-o ment-a "What-a". (Oh, sorry, I ment what.) 
SGT.DONOWITZ After-teri, you-a set-ta boom-a, five-o moment-o, you-a, fuck-o Pphisst. (After you set the bomb, wait five minutes and get the fuck out of here.) 
HIRSCHBERG Affirm-ato, affirm-ato. (Affirmative, Affirmative) 
SGT.DONOWITZ Good-a, Luck-a. (Good luck.) 
15Z. Donowitz stands from his seat, and walks out of the dark auditorium, into the lobby. The Nazi Guards/Ushers are gone, the lobby is completely empty. Seeing the STAIRS leading down to the WATER CLOSET/BATHROOM, he descends them to plant the Boom-a, I mean, The Bomb. 
DESCENDING THE STAIRS leading to the Water closet. Like a lot of old cinema's, not only was the water closet located under the auditorium, you had to pass through a rather large SMOKING LOUNGE to get to it. In the Smoking Lounge are TEN NAZI ENLISTED MEN, the Guards/Ushers for the event, smoking and indulging in soldiers gossip. They're all in dress uniforms, and all are armed. Donowitz, in his tuxedo, acts cool, and walks right through them. They look up, but don't disturb there time off vibe. Donny enters the big Water Closet. Except for ONE LONE NAZI ENLISTED MAN at the urinal, it would appear as if Donny has the whole wash room to himself. He enters the privacy of a toilet stall, locks the door. 
MARCEL IN LOBBY He descends the stairs leading down from the projection booth, into the empty lobby. He goes to one of the auditorium doors, and peers inside. 
WE SEE THE SCREEN AND THE AUDIENCE FROM MARCELS POV: in the back of the room. The audience seems riveted to Fredrick's exploits on screen. Marcel closes the door, and with a KEY, DEADBOLTS it SHUT. 
INSIDE THE AUDITORIUM WE PAN OFF THE SCREEN to Marcel, who locks the two doors on ether side of the screen....due to curtains placed there, no one notices Marcels actions. Marcel then goes BEHIND THE SCREEN, WE SEE the IMAGE (backward) of Fredricks sniper battle HUGE COVERING ENTIRE SIDE ROOM ...A PILE of over300nitrate FILM PRINTS, lay like a junk pile, right behind the screen. Sitting down in a wooden chair facing the screen, and Pile-o-film, he lights up a cigarette, a absolute no-no in a cinema of this era, but tonight, what does it matter?4. He smokes, and waits for his cue to... .BURN IT DOWN! 
FREDRICK IN OPERA BOX along side Hitler, Goebbels, Francesca, and BOORMAN. On screen the battle rages. He leans over and whispers something in Goebbels ear, we can't hear. Goebbels makes a very sympathetic face (at least sympathetic for Goebbels), and says in German; 
GOEBBELS Perfectly understandable, dear boy. You go now, and we'll see you after the show. He exits the opera box. And walks to the projection booth door. He raps on the door in a trying to be amusing way. The door opens, just a little bit, Shosanna not friendly, stares at him. Be, as per usual, is all smiles and charm. They speak in FRENCH, SUBTITLED into ENGLISH; 
FREDRICK Are you the manager, of this cinema? I want my money back. That actor in the movie stinks. He laughs. 
IV She doesn't even smile. She says, in all serious business; 
BULLET BLOWS OFF HEEL OF HER FOOT... Luger drops to floor, Fredrick DIES. Our young French Jewish heroine, lies on the projection booth floor, in a pool of her own blood, her body RIDDLED with bullets, her nerve endings wracked with pain, CRIPPLED and 
DIEING... 
WHEN... ..the little bell on the 1st projector, starts to ring, informing the projectionist, it's time for The REEL CHANGE. Dieing or not, if Shosanna intends to get her revenge, she's going to have to lift her ass off the floor, and execute this fucking reel change. 
CINEMA AUDITORIUM The battle on screen continues waging. The audience is riveted. The FUHRER watches, completely caught up in the dramatic spectacle. He says to Goebbels in German; 
HITLER Extraordinary Joseph, simply extraordinary. This is your finest film yet. Goebbels is beyond proud, he smiles to Francesca, who proudly pats his hand. 
PROJECTION BOOTH Shosanna, bloody, crippled, and fucked, with great painful effort, PULLS HERSELF OFF THE FLOOR... 
AUDITORIUM Hirschberg, sitting in his seat, SETS the BOMB on his ankle. Then stands up, and begins scooting past everybody in his rows knees. 
PROJECTION BOOTH like the German heroine in one of Riefenstahl's mountain films, Shosanna CLIMBS UP the 35mm film projector, like it was Piz Palu... 
FILM ON SCREEN Private Zoller FIRING away from his perch. In the top far right corner of The FRAME. WE SEE the 1st REEL CHANGE MARK... 
PROJECTION BOOTH Shosanna hanging on to projector, waiting for 2nd reel change mark, it's a agonizing effort... 
BEHIND SCREEN Marcel, smoking, waiting for his cue... 
HIRSCHBERG get out of his xow, and begins walking up the aisle in the middle of the cinema towards the exit. 
ON SCREEN SERGIO LEONE CU FREDRICK, he SCREAMS to Russians below; 
MOVIE ZOLLER Who wants to send a message to Germany? In the top right of FRAME The 2nd REEL CHANGE MARK POPS ON... 
PROJECTION BOOTH Shosanna TOSSES herself to the floor, as she THROWS THE CHANGE OVER SWITCH on the 2nd Projector...

AUDITORIUM 
ON THE SILVER SCREEN FREDRICKS EX CU 
CUT TO 
ON SILVER SCREEN MATCHING SHOSANNA EX CU CAMERA in the exact same placement, same background (b/w sky), SLIGHT LOW ANGLE LOOKING UP, so on screen Shosanna is looking down on the Nazi's, the way Fredrick was looking down on the Russians. The way this HUGE IMAGE OF SHOSANNA'S GIANT FACE stares down the auditorium of Nazi's, brings to mind Orwells "1984" Big Brother. HITLER and GOEBBELS React. 
HIRSCHBERG standing in the middle of the aisle, turns towards the screen. When he see's Shosanna's GIANT FACE, he's gobsmacked. 
BEHIND SCREEN Marcel sitting in the chair, with his cigarette, before the 
EVEN MORE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA. 
SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE ON SCREEN She stares down the packed house of Nazi's, and says in FRENCH; 
SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE I have a message for Germany. I'm interrupting your Nazi propaganda horse shit, to inform you despicable German swine, that your all going to die. HITLER and GOEBBELS react. 
HIRSCHBERG react. 
MARCEL smiles. 
SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE And I want you to look deep in the face of The Jew who's going to do it. 
AUDITORIUM AUDIENCE While the shocked German audience is transfixed to thescreen, behind the heads of most of them... The BOMB Landa set in Hitlers and Goebbels opera box... 
EXPLODES. 
BLOWING TO SMITHEREENS, HITLER, FRANCESCA, BOORMAN, and propelling GOEBBELS, still in his theatre seat, across the auditorium, into the opposite wall, and taking out a portion of the ceiling as well. The crowd reacts... The explosion causes the huge chandelier from Versailles, to topple from it's jerry-rigged placement, and CRASH on to the audience below... ON SCREEN THE GIANT FACE OF SHOSANNA finishes her WAR CRY. 
SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face of Jewish Vengeance! Marcel, 
BURN IT DOWN! 
BEHIND THE SCREEN Marcel takes his cigarette, and FLICKS IT into the pile of nitrate film. ON SCREEN SHOSANNAS GIANT FACE LAUGHS MANIACALLY at the scrambling little Nazi's, running in a panic, as FLAMES LIKE

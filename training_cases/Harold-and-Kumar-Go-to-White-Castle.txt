FADE IN: 
1   INT. BILLY OFFICE (BREWSTER KEEGAN INVESTMENT BANK)- 4:50 PM 
BILLY CARVER (mid-20s, good looking, "romantic") is sitting at his desk, depressed, staring at a photo of his ex- girlfriend. 
MAN (O.S.) Billy Boy! J.D. BANKS (mid-20s, always looking for a good time) enters the office. 
J.D. Get your ass ready! It's almost five o'clock and this bad boy needs to get his drink on! J.D. notices his friend pining over the photo. 
J.D. Oh God. Give me that.     I'm burning it once and for all. J.D. snatches the photo, and pulls out his lighter. Just as the flame is about to touch the photo, BILLY grabs it back. 
BILLY Don't! 
J.D. Dude, it's been six months.    You have to move on. BILLY nods knowingly. 
J.D. You know what'll cheer you up? Some hot chick riding your jock all night long. 
BILLY You're such a romantic, J.D. 
J.D. It would help get your mind off of Sarah. BILLY ponders this for a moment. 
BILLY Whatever. Even if I wanted to meet other women, I wouldn't even know what to do. I've been out of the game so long. 
J.D. Billy, you come out with me tonight, and I promise you'll get laid. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   2. 
BILLY Sounds tempting, but I can't. Berenson needs me to update the financial models for his meeting with the foreign investors. 
J.D. So what? It's Friday!      You have all weekend to do that. 
BILLY No I don't. The Germans are taking an earlier flight back, so the meeting's been moved to tomorrow. J.D. thinks for a moment. 
J.D. Well, why don't you just get somebody else to do your work then? 
BILLY Who? J.D. gets a big smile on his face.    He has an idea. 
2   INT. HAROLD'S CUBICLE - 4:55 PM                                 2 HAROLD LEE (22 years old, the typical Asian-American workhorse you'll find in any investment bank) is packing up his briefcase, getting ready to leave for the day. BILLY and J.D. approach... 
BILLY Harold, listen, I need you to update these models for me. 
HAROLD (confused) But aren't you supposed to... 
BILLY I know, but something came up. I have to meet with some clients tonight, so I won't be able to get to it. It's your responsibility now. Okay? Harold doesn't like this, but before he even has a chance to protest, J.D. steps forward... 
J.D. And make sure it's in tomorrow by nine o'clock sharp. 
(MORE) 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003     3. J.D. (cont'd) With all the downsizing going on around here, we wouldn't want to have to tell Berenson that you've been slacking. He's just dying to figure out who he should fire next. 
HAROLD Uh...okay...no problem... BILLY drops a big stack of papers on Harold's desk. 
3   EXT. OFFICE BUILDING PARKING LOT - 5:00 PM                    3 BILLY and J.D. are walking through the parking lot. 
BILLY Wow!   I can't believe how easy that was! 
J.D. Dude, how do you think I get all my shit done? I'm telling you -- those Asian guys love crunching numbers. You probably just made his weekend. The guys have reached J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE. 
4   INT. J.D.'S CONVERTIBLE                                       4 Billy and J.D. enter the car. 
J.D. Now get ready. It's time we embark on...Operation Get Some! And with that, J.D. presses a button in his car that causes the top of the convertible to go down and a funky white boy song kicks in. Intercut: 
5   INT/EXT. J.D'S CONVERTABLE                                    5 Billy and J.D. think they're hot shit as they cruise through the parking lot blasting their tunes. When the lyrics kick in, J.D. begins lip-syncing passionately. Billy loves it. When the chorus begins, the guys begin dancing in their seats in an unrealistic, synchronized, choreographed manner. J.D. gives a thumbs up to an ELDERLY PARKING ATTENDANT as his car zooms out of the parking lot. 
21   INT. LIVING ROOM - 7:30 PM                                   21 Harold and Kumar are now smoking out of an ENORMOUS BONG, while watching TV. The room is filled with smoke. 
ANGLE - TELEVISION It's an episode of "The Router Workshop." 
ANGLE - HAROLD AND KUMAR 
KUMAR I think we've already seen this one. Harold changes the channel... 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003   14. 
ANGLE - TELEVISION It's an anti-marijuana commercial. Two teenagers are listening to rock music in a house without parents. One teenager (blonde) passes a joint to the other (brown haired). 
BLONDE HAIRED KID Come on, dude. Just take one hit.       Don't you want to be cool? Nervously, Brown Haired Kid takes a hit of the joint. Right after he exhales, he walks over to his DAD'S GUN RACK and takes out a LONG RIFLE... 
BLONDE HAIRED KID Hey man, what are you doing? 
BROWN HAIRED KID I'm so high!    Nothing can hurt me! The Brown Haired Kid puts the end of the rifle in his mouth. We see Blonde Haired kid in slow motion go "Nooooo!" BANG! 
WE HEAR A GUNSHOT AS THE SCREEN TURNS BLACK... 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Marijuana kills. 
ANGLE -    HAROLD AND KUMAR They're laughing their asses off at the commercial. 
KUMAR I love that shit! Harold continues flipping channels... 
ANGLE- TV We see a News report 
NEWSCASTER Tonight...a Cheetah escaped from the Morristown Zoo... ANGLE - Harold and Kumar Harold's not interested.       He continues flipping... 
HAROLD Nice.   Sixteen Candles is on. 
KUMAR And the award for least heterosexual statement ever made in this apartment goes to... 
(MORE) 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003       15. KUMAR (cont'd) (mock opening an envelope) ...Harold Lee! Come on down! Take a bow! 
HAROLD Oh come on. It's a John Hughes movie! It's a classic! It's a beautiful story about someone who feels unnoticed, unappreciated, unloved... 
KUMAR Hey look!   It's you! Kumar points to the TV where we see a CLIP FROM SIXTEEN CANDLES--[Long Duk Dong talking about quiche/round pie] Kumar laughs.   Harold isn't amused. We see another CLIP [Long Duk talking about the chores he does for the grandparents]. 
KUMAR Hey, when are you gonna start doing some chores around here? Harold gives Kumar a "don't even joke" look. He then violently grabs the bong from Kumar and lights it. Kumar laughs as Harold exhales a lot of smoke... 
HAROLD We're so high right now. 
KUMAR We're not low. 
HAROLD I don't know about you, but I'm hungry as balls. 
KUMAR No shit!    Let's eat! HAROLD bends down and picks up A BUNCH OF DELIVERY MENUS that have been left on the floor... 
KUMAR Nah, I don't feel like delivery tonight. 
HAROLD What about KFC? 
KUMAR Nah, we've been there too many times. (beat) I want something we haven't had in awhile. Something different. Something that'll really hit the spot. I want the perfect food... 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   16. 
VOICE ON TV Are you hungry? HAROLD and KUMAR turn their attention to the TV, where they see A WHITE CASTLE COMMERCIAL taking place. In the commercial, we see DOZENS OF TINY BURGERS lined up in a row. 
VOICE ON TV Then come to White Castle and try our Slyder Special-- six burgers, fries, and a soft drink for only 2.99. HAROLD and KUMAR start salivating, as they see THE STEAM RISE 
FROM THE BURGERS ON THE T.V. 
VOICE ON TV Imagine all those burgers in your stomach right now. Mmmmmh.... HAROLD and KUMAR move closer to the TV to smell the burgers. 
VOICE ON TV Don't you like food that's tasty and delicious? Almost in a trance, HAROLD and KUMAR nod agreeingly. 
VOICE ON TV Then what are you waiting for? Head over to White Castle. It's what you crave. The commercial ends. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other-- this is clearly an emotional moment for both of them. 
22   INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE APARTMENT - 7:45                        22 HAROLD and KUMAR exit their apartment. 
KUMAR So what? She's fucking cute.     Let her touch your penis. They exit the front door of the building... 
26A   EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING                                    26A Harold and Kumar walk down the steps, where they see COLE and the EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS doing lame skateboard tricks on the sidewalk near their jeep. They're about to get back in the jeep, when Cole sees Harold and Kumar walking near them. 
COLE Hey look, it's the Brother's McFag! (to Harold and Kumar) Let me guess, the yellow one's the catcher! 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   20. 
COLE AND THE PUNKS LAUGH HYSTERICALLY. Harold is uncomfortable. Kumar just ignores them. 
COLE (to the Punks) Come on, guys! Let's get ourselves some fucking Mountain Dew! 
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Extreme! They take off, driving by Harold and Kumar.   Harold gives them a pissed off look as they drive away. 
HAROLD Why do I have to be the catcher? 
KUMAR Dude, forget about those pricks.    Let's just go. They continue walking... 
27   OMIT                                                         27

KUMAR (getting frustrated) Jesus, that took forever. You know the purpose of a car is to avoid walking. (beat) And what kind of parking job is this? You're like a mile away from the curb. 
HAROLD Don't even start. 
KUMAR (laughing) Just fucking with you.   Now let's go out and get those burgers.   I'm fucking starving! They get in the car and slam the door. The engine starts and the car takes off, revealing that they were parked next to a 
MCDONALD'S. 
29   OMIT                                                         29

34   EXT. HIGHWAY - 8:30 PM                                       34 We see Harold's Infiniti driving down the highway. 
35   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                       35 Harold is meticulously rolling a joint. 
KUMAR Hey, Rold-- do you think C3PO is gay? 
HAROLD Of course he's gay! You remember in the first Star Wars when he was like... (in a gay C3PO voice) "Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel soooo good!" Kumar laughs. 
36   EXT. HIGHWAY - 8:45PM                                        36 Harold's Infiniti approaches a line of TOLL BOOTHS. 
37   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                       37 KUMAR pulls up to an EXACT CHANGE TOLL BOOTH. 
KUMAR Dude, give me thirty-five cents. HAROLD sorts through some change in his hand and gives Kumar the money. KUMAR tosses the change into the basket and waits for the TOLL BOOTH STOPLIGHT to turn green. It doesn't. 
KUMAR What's going on? It didn't register. (beat) Dude, give me thirty-five more cents. 
HAROLD I don't have anymore change. 
KUMAR Should I just go through? 
HAROLD No.   I don't like breaking the law. Harold licks the joint as he puts the finishing touches on. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   22. 
KUMAR I can see that. A CAR HONKS BEHIND THEM. Kumar turns around and sees a number of cars lining up behind them. Right behind them, A BIG BURLY GUY leans his head out of a car... 
BIG BURLY GUY Hey!    Move your ass! 
KUMAR (to Harold) I'm going through. 
HAROLD Just hold on. I'll walk over to one of the manned booths and tell them what happened. The honking continues as HAROLD starts to open the door... 
KUMAR Oh fuck. KUMAR puts the pedal to the metal and ZOOMS AWAY FROM THEM. 
42   EXT. MARTIN LUTHER KING BLVD                                  42 The BASKETBALL PLAYERS watch the car speed away. AFTER A 
COUPLE SECONDS, THEY ALL LOOK AT EACH OTHER, AND START 
LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY! A RANDOM BASKETBALL PLAYER TURNS TO 
THE HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN... 
RANDOM BASKETBALL PLAYER Man, you scared the shit out of them! Make that face again! 
HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN Okay, okay, okay... THE HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN suppresses his laughter and tries to make the face. He bursts out laughing again. 
HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN Shit.   I can't do it. His friends laugh harder.      He tries to regain his composure. 
HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK MAN Hold up.   Hold up... He manages to make his angriest face for two seconds, before bursting out laughing again. 
43   EXT. HIGHWAY - 9:45 PM                                        43 We see Harold's Infiniti back on the highway, driving fast... 
HAROLD That was close, dude. 
44   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                        44 KUMAR sees a HIGHWAY SIGN-- "NEW BRUNSWICK-- NEXT EXIT." 
KUMAR Rold, check it out!      We're almost there! 
HAROLD Yes!    Thank God! I'm starving! 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   26. 
KUMAR Well, prepare to gorge yourself. 
45   EXT. NEW BRUNSWICK EXIT                                     45 We see Harold's Infiniti take the exit... 
46   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET (NEW BRUNSWICK) - 9:55 PM              46 Harold's Infiniti drives down a street, loaded with mini- malls and fast food joints... 
47   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                      47 HAROLD and KUMAR are looking for the White Castle... 
HAROLD Oh man, I'm so hungry. I'm gonna eat like twenty of those burgers. 
KUMAR I'll see your twenty and raise you five orders of fries. 
HAROLD God, where the hell is this place? 
KUMAR Don't worry, we'll find it. HAROLD sees a HIGH SCHOOL up ahead... 
HAROLD There's the multiplex! 
KUMAR That means the White Castle should be just around the corner... 
HAROLD AND KUMAR'S MOUTHS DROP! INSTEAD OF WHITE CASTLE, 
THEY SEE A BURGER SHACK. THEY'RE IN TOTAL SHOCK. 
HAROLD What the hell's going on, Kumar?! That doesn't look like a White Castle to me! 
KUMAR We gotta get to the bottom of this! 
48   EXT. BURGER SHACK DRIVE THRU - 10:00 PM                     48 KUMAR drives right up to the PICK UP WINDOW, where we see a chubby BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE... 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   27. 
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE I'm sorry. You have to order at the drive thru menu... 
KUMAR What happened to the White Castle? 
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE Excuse me? 
KUMAR There used to be a White Castle right in this spot. Where is it? 
BURGER SHACK EMPLOYEE (remembering) Oh yeah. There was a White Castle here. Look guys, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but Burger Shack bought this location four years ago. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, devastated. 
KUMAR Please tell me there's another White Castle in town. 
CINDY I'm so glad you showed up, Harold! 
HAROLD (unenthusiastic) Yeah. Me too. 
CINDY Did you like the Hibiscus petals I glued to the envelope I sent you? 
HAROLD Uh, yeah.    They were...nice. Suddenly, one of the nerdy Asian students (KENNETH) raises his hand. HAROLD looks at him strangely, and then over to Cindy. "Does this guy think I'm a teacher or something?" Harold sits there and stares at Kenneth for a while... 
HAROLD (to Kenneth) Uh, yes? 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   31. 
KENNETH Kenneth Park. Class of 2004. Is it true you're an analyst at Brewster Keegan? 
HAROLD Yeah, I'm a junior analyst. 
KENNETH Awesome! KENNETH high-fives with the nerdy Asian student next to him. He then raises his hand again. HAROLD rolls his eyes... 
HAROLD Yes? 
KENNETH Uh, this is actually a two-part question. I'm applying for a summer internship at Brewster Keegan, and I was wondering a) what it's like being an investment banker and b) if you would write me a recommendation. 
HAROLD What it's like being an investment banker? Well Kenneth, to be honest, it's pretty... HAROLD looks into the eyes of the young, eager, Asian students. He can't bear to tell them the truth... 
HAROLD ...awesome? All the Asian students start high-fiving with each other. 
HAROLD As for the recommendation, I may be able to make a call or two... CINDY looks at her watch... 
CINDY Actually Harold, we should be getting to the party. We can discuss all this stuff there. It's just down the hall. All the Asian students get up... 
HAROLD Sorry, Cindy. I can't go. I have to wait for Kumar... 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   32. 
CINDY You'll see him when we're done. Trust me, you're gonna love this. Kenny's mom dropped off a big jar of kimchi jigae. Kenneth looks proud of himself. 
HAROLD Nice. CINDY grabs HAROLD's hand and drags him away. 
52    INT. DORM HALLWAY - 11:15 PM                                 52 KUMAR is standing in the hallway, accosting random students. He sees one RANDOM STUDENT walk by... 
KUMAR Hey! You know where I can get some chronic? The RANDOM STUDENT doesn't respond. Kumar is frustrated... 
KUMAR What kind of Ivy League school is this? 
52A   EXT. PRINCETON DORM - 11:16 PM                             52A Kumar exits the dorm, and walks throughout the quad, asking random students for drugs. Eventually, a HIPPIE-LOOKING STUDENT (Phish t-shirt, Birkenstocks) taps KUMAR on the back. 
HIPPIE ASSHOLE Heeey, Man. Lookin' to toke up? KUMAR breathes a sigh of relief... 
KUMAR Thank Christ! Look, just give me a dime of your finest herb. The Hippie Asshole opens his backpack. Inside, Kumar sees A GIANT PLASTIC BAG FILLED WITH WEED. He's awestruck... 
KUMAR Oh my dear sweet lord... Kumar reaches for the weed, but the Hippie Asshole knocks his hand away... 
HIPPIE ASSHOLE Yo, man!   Not cool! This is my baby, man! 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     33. 
Hippie Asshole sizes Kumar up and then gives Kumar him a measly dime bag... 
HIPPIE ASSHOLE That'll be eighty bucks. 
KUMAR Eighty bucks?! It's worth forty tops, bro! The Hippie Asshole grabs the baggy back from Kumar. 
HIPPIE ASSHOLE I'm not your bro...bro. And if you feel like staying sober, go ahead, don't buy it. That's cool with me. I can find lots of people who want to get high. I can smoke it myself, man. 
KUMAR Jesus, what the hell kind of hippie are you? 
HIPPIE ASSHOLE One who understands the concept of supply and demand, dude. Kumar and the Hippie Asshole stare each other down. After a couple seconds, Kumar shakes his head, pissed off. He takes out his wallet and hands all his cash to the Hippie Asshole. 
HIPPIE ASSHOLE (laughing like a prick) Dumbass. Suddenly, CHRISTY and CLARISSA (TWO GORGEOUS TWINS, BLONDE, BLUE EYES, BIG BREASTS, BRITISH ACCENTS) approach carrying take-out bags. They see KUMAR and the Hippie Asshole making their deal. 
CHRISTY Hey, you guys about to smoke? KUMAR and HIPPIE ASSHOLE turn and see THE TWINS.   They're both floored by their hotness. 
HIPPIE ASSHOLE (to the Twins) Yeah. Wanna come back to my place? 
WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF DIARRHEA HITTING THE BOWL. 
CLARISSA Ahhhhh! HAROLD and KUMAR look horrified.      There is silence for a few seconds until.... 
CHRISTY Hey Clarissa. Do you wanna play battle shits? We see HAROLD quizzically mouth "battle shits?" 
CLARISSA Oh my God. We haven't played that since back in camp! HAROLD and KUMAR look confused. 
WE HEAR A LOUD FARTING NOISE, THEN THE SOUND OF SHIT HITTING 
THE WATER... 
CHRISTY Wait for it.    Wait for it.    Ahhhhh! 
CLARISSA Hit! HAROLD and Kumar look terrified. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   38. 
55   EXT. DORM COMMON ROOM                                        55 Meanwhile, CINDY has left the other students and is roaming the hallways, looking for Harold. She sees Hippie Asshole walking by, counting Kumar's money... 
CINDY Have you seen a Korean guy around here? 
HIPPIE ASSHOLE Uh, yeah. There's like, two hundred of them in this dorm. (to himself, but audible) `Tard. Cindy can't help but feel a little stupid. 
56   INT. WOMEN'S BATHROOM                                        56 We hear the sound of diarrhea splattering against the bowl. 
CLARISSA Hit! We see HAROLD dry heave. We hear the sound of diarrhea hitting the bowl again. CLARISSA smiles. 
CHRISTY You sank my destroyer! Scag! KUMAR almost pukes as HE DROPS THE POT INTO THE TOILET BOWL. 
HAROLD (whispering) Shit! 
THEY SEE THE MARIJUANA UNPROTECTED FLOATING IN THE TOILET. 
WE THEN HEAR THE MOST DISGUSTING DIARRHEA SOUND YET. 
HAROLD 
I CAN'T TAKE THIS! With that, HAROLD runs out of the stall and exits the bathroom. The girls look shocked. 
CHRISTY Who was that? KUMAR looks nervous. He quickly bolts from the bathroom. 
CLARISSA Christy, are you still here? 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   39. 
Silence until...We hear a SUPER LOUD FART.    CHRISTY starts laughing. 
CLARISSA Damn!   You sank my battle shit! 
57    EXT. HALLWAY                                                   57 Harold and Kumar run down the dorm hallway, grossed out.    As they run, they suddenly see-- 
57A   INT. COMMON ROOM                                            57A Harold and Kumar stop in their tracks when they see the EAST ASIAN STUDENTS ASSOCIATION party in full blast. All the "nerdy" asian kids from Cindy's room are grinding with each other as KENNETH RAPS A FILTHY RAP. Harold and Kumar look at each other in shock. Some of the dancing Asian chicks look pretty hot. Kenneth jumps off the couch he was standing on, holding a big bag of POT BROWNIES. 
KENNETH Pot brownies for everyone! Kenneth throws some pot brownies in the air. People grab at them. Harold and Kumar can't believe it. Two Cute Asian Chicks approach Kenneth... 
CUTE ASIAN CHICK #1 Hey, K-dog!   Can we have some brownies? 
KENNETH To tell you the truth, I'm running low. But a quick titty flash may persuade me. The Korean chicks look at each other. "Should we?" "Okay!" They lift up their shirts and bras, revealing their boobs. 
KUMAR Dude, I'm starting to think you made a mistake by not going to this party... Harold gives him a dirty look. Then, suddenly, the SECURITY GUARD from before appears in the hallway with ANOTHER 
SECURITY GUARD (#2)-- 
SECURITY GUARD Hey, you! The guys turn and see the guards running at them. HAROLD AND 
KUMAR RUN AS FAST AS THEY CAN DOWN THE HALLWAY, WITH THE 
GUARDS CHASING AFTER THEM... 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   40. 
Further down the hall, they pass the party. The partygoers watch as the guys run by, except for Kenneth, who makes a quick grab at one of the topless girl's boobs. When she notices, Kenneth quickly looks away, as if he did nothing. Cindy Kim notices Harold... 
KUMAR Thanks. 
63   INT. CAR - 11:55 PM                                             63 KUMAR gets into the car and shuts the door.     He hits the gas and continues driving down the dark road... 
HAROLD Do you even know where you're going? 
KUMAR I'll be honest, I'm a little lost. But don't worry. Once we get on the highway, we'll be there soon. 
HAROLD We better. It starts to rain... 
HAROLD Shit, now it's raining. 
KUMAR What's the big deal? 
HAROLD Look, I'm completely on edge right now, okay? After all the shit we've been through tonight, I don't know how much more of this I can take. 
AT THAT MOMENT, THE RACCOON JUMPS OUT FROM UNDER HAROLD'S 
SEAT, CRAWLS OVER THE LAPTOP, ONTO HIS CHEST, AND STARTS 
BITING HIS NECK... 
HAROLD 
AHHHHH!!!     FUCK!!!! KUMAR turns and sees the raccoon on Harold. 
KUMAR Holy shit! HAROLD tries to pry the raccoon away from his neck.     KUMAR tries to help him. 
64   EXT. DIRT ROAD                                                  64 We see Harold's Infiniti SWERVING BACK AND FORTH. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   43A. 
65   INT. CAR                                                  65 HAROLD FINALLY GETS THE RACCOON OFF OF HIM. He holds it as far away from his face as possible. The raccoon's arms and legs are scurrying around-- trying to escape. 
KUMAR How the hell did that get in here? 
HAROLD Shit! It bit my neck! I probably have rabies now or something! 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003     44. 
KUMAR (looking at Harold's neck) Don't worry. He didn't even break your skin. You'll be fine. 
SUDDENLY, THE RACCOON COUGHS UP BLOOD ONTO HAROLD'S SHIRT. 
HAROLD Oh, that's not good! 
HAROLD TURNS THE RACCOON AWAY FROM HIM.          THE RACCOON COUGHS 
UP BLOOD ONTO KUMAR. 
KUMAR Ahh! Dude, get that fucking cancer raccoon away from me!!! 
KUMAR SWERVES THE CAR IN A PANIC, AS HAROLD OPENS HIS WINDOW. 
KUMAR WATCHES AS HAROLD CHUCKS THE RACCOON OUT THE WINDOW. 
KUMAR Thank Christ! Kumar looks back onto the road, where HE SEES A PAIR OF 
HEADLIGHTS HEADING STRAIGHT FOR HIM! 
HAROLD                                KUMAR Shit!!!                                Shit!!! KUMAR quickly hits the brakes, as does the other car. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, breathing heavily. They watch nervously as the other DRIVER exits his car and begins walking over to them. 
HAROLD Uh-oh. KUMAR rolls down his window.         The DRIVER peers inside... 
GOLDSTEIN What the hell do you think you were doing? You almost killed us! GOLDSTEIN sees that it's HAROLD and KUMAR. 
GOLDSTEIN Holy Shit! 
KUMAR Goldstein? HAROLD breathes a sigh of relief. 
GOLDSTEIN (to his car) Dude, it's Rold and Kumar! 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    45. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    47. 
KUMAR Great, let's get out of here. Just as Harold and Kumar walk down the hallway to the EXIT... 
MAN WITH THICK INDIAN ACCENT (O.S.) Kumar!!! Kumar know that voice all too well... 
KUMAR Shit. 
KUMAR turns around and sees HIS FATHER standing next to HIS BROTHER SAIKAT (a nerdy-looking Indian guy with glasses, five years older than Kumar). Both are in doctor attire. 
HAROLD Oh, now I see why you didn't want to come to the hospital. Kumar gives Harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches. 
KUMAR'S FATHER (thick accent) I hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today. Dr. Woodruff is a very good friend of mine, and let's just say he was not at all amused by your antics...and neither am I. 
SAIKAT (no accent) What the hell's wrong with you, Kumar? Look at me. I own my own house. I drive a beamer. And I get laid whenever I want. You can have all that too, if you'd just get off your ass and go to med school. 
KUMAR Eat my balls, Saikat. 
SAIKAT God, you're 22 years old already! When are you gonna grow up and stop with this post-college rebel bullshit? Like your life is so tough. Kumar doesn't have a response.   Saikat's right. 
KUMAR'S FATHER I will not tolerate this business from you any longer. You have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one I'm setting up for you. 
(MORE) 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003      48. KUMAR'S FATHER (cont'd) If I hear from Dr. Wein that you were anything short of spectacular, I'll completely cut you off! 
KUMAR Oh, come on, dad! 
KUMAR'S FATHER "Daddy will not be coming on anything!" You will be there and you will behave! I've put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up. KUMAR lowers his head.   He's been put in his place. 
KUMAR You're right. I'm sorry. KUMAR gives HIS FATHER a hug.   He even gives SAIKAT a hug. 
KUMAR It won't happen again. 
KUMAR'S FATHER Good.   I'll speak with you tomorrow. KUMAR'S FATHER gives KUMAR a quick kiss on the head, then he and SAIKAT walk away. HAROLD is stunned... 
HAROLD Wow. So I guess you're going to med school after all, huh? 
KUMAR Fuck that! Like I care what my dad thinks. I can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out I skipped the interview tomorrow. He wants to cut me off? Fine! I don't need his money! 
HAROLD (extremely confused) But...you just hugged him... 
KUMAR I just needed to get my hands on these... KUMAR holds up SAIKAT and HIS FATHER'S SCAN CARDS. 
KUMAR Two words-- medical marijuana. HAROLD shakes his head in disgust. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   49. 
74A   INT. DOCTOR'S LOUNGE                                       74A Using the SCAN CARDS, Harold and Kumar walk into a room where there are loads of medical supplies, including SCRUBS. Kumar grabs a couple and hands one to Harold. They put them on... 
KUMAR Look, I'm telling you, they see   an Indian and Asian guy wearing these and   they'll just assume we're doctors. Then   we walk right into the pharmacy and get   the weed. Harold does not appear happy he's doing this. 
75    INT. HALLWAY                                                75 HAROLD and KUMAR (now wearing blue jackets and doctors masks) walk out of the lounge and head down the hallway... 
HAROLD If we get caught, you're taking the blame. This wasn't my idea. 
KUMAR We're not gonna get caught. We're gonna get toasted and then we're gonna eat delicious White Castle-- just like we planned. All of a sudden, a hand grabs Kumar from behind. Freaked out, they turn around and see a MALE NURSE (frazzled, touchy feely). 
MALE NURSE Dr. Patel, thank God I found you!    I need your help immediately! The NURSE drags them to a nearby emergency room... 
76    INT. EMERGENCY ROOM                                         76 The scene is very fast paced, with several YOUNG MEDICAL TECHNICIANS rushing around. Harold is confused and concerned as the Nurse leads he and Kumar over towards a patient... 
HAROLD (whispering to Kumar) What the hell's going on here? 
KUMAR He must think I'm Saikat. Don't worry. Leave the talking up to me. On the operating table is a PATIENT BLEEDING FROM HIS CHEST. He is conscious and appears to be in a lot of pain. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   50. 
MALE NURSE The patient was brought in by EMS five minutes ago. He has three gunshot wounds with entry in the anterior abdomen. No exit wounds. HAROLD sees blood squirt out of the PATIENT'S chest. 
HAROLD Oh shit!   This guy's gonna die!!! 
THE PATIENT HEARS THIS AND LOOKS NERVOUSLY AT HAROLD. 
KUMAR Harold. It's one in the morning. We're an hour from home. And who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. I mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and I was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment I'd tell you "this is a sign." 
HAROLD Stop it. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   54. 
KUMAR Come on. Just pretend you're a nerdy Asian Tom Hanks and she's a hot Latina Meg Ryan...with bigger tits. Besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way... 
HAROLD Let's just go! KUMAR presses a button CAUSING HAROLD'S WINDOW TO GO DOWN. 
HAROLD What are you doing?! 
KUMAR (calling out) Hey Maria! MARIA looks up. HAROLD QUICKLY DUCKS IN HIS SEAT. HE THEN 
REACHES DOWN WITH HIS HAND TO HIT THE GAS PEDDLE. THE CAR 
STARTS PEELING OUT... 
KUMAR Hey, get your hand off the gas! Kumar tries kicking Harold's hand off the gas.   Just then, 
THE CAR BEGINS SHAKING INTENSELY... 
KUMAR (looking up) Oh shit! Harold's Infiniti HAS DRIVEN OFF THE ROAD AND IS SPEEDING 
DOWN A DIRT AND ROCK COVERED HILL. KUMAR grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car safely. HAROLD is bumping around on the way down the hill. Finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a DIRT ROAD. 
HAROLD You asshole! My car's probably all scratched up now! 
KUMAR Don't blame me. You're the one who ran us off the road! 
HAROLD I told you I didn't want to speak to her! (composing himself) Whatever. Let's jut get back on the highway. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     55. 
KUMAR Fine. KUMAR presses the gas. Suddenly, we hear a "POP!"   Harold and Kumar look at each other-- angry and frustrated. 
79   EXT. SIDE OF THE ROAD - 1:15 AM                               79 HAROLD examines the flat tire. Kumar is standing nearby. There's not another car in site. 
HAROLD Godammit. You know how to change a flat? 
KUMAR Please. Only hicks and Italian guys know how to change a tire. Harold looks in his trunk for the spare.    It's missing. 
HAROLD Where's my spare tire? 
KUMAR I don't know. 
HAROLD Shit, where the hell is it? Kumar suddenly remembers... 
KUMAR Oh yeah! Don't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float? 
HAROLD What bridge? What the hell are you talking about? 
KUMAR (realizing) Oh shit. That's right. I was with Goldstein. We borrowed your car that day. My bad. 
HAROLD Your bad?   What are the hell are we gonna do now?! Suddenly, they see AN OLD PICK-UP TRUCK driving in their direction. HAROLD and KUMAR wave it down. The truck stops in front of them. The door opens and a SHADOWY FIGURE begins walking towards them. Harold and Kumar are nervous. As soon as the FIGURE reaches them, LIGHTENING STRIKES. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   56. 
It's the UGLIEST MAN OF ALL TIME-- he's in his fifties, wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, HE HAS LARGE BUMPS AND BOILS ALL OVER HIS FACE. Harold and Kumar jump back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him. 
UGLY MAN You boys need some help? The UGLY MAN takes off his mesh cap. Even his haircut is freaky. He has a SKULLET (A MULLET BUT WITH NO HAIR ON TOP). HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other, freaked out. 
80   EXT. DIRT ROAD - 1:20 AM                                    80 The UGLY MAN'S TRUCK tows Harold's Infiniti down a dirt road. 
81   INT. TRUCK                                                  81 The UGLY MAN is driving. KUMAR is in the front seat, on the passenger side. HAROLD is sandwiched between them. 
HAROLD Thanks for helping us out. 
FREAK SHOW No problem at all. Saw you boys stranded there and thought to myself, "what would Jesus do?" Harold and Kumar look at each other. They then notice a JESUS CHRIST bobble-head doll on the dashboard... 
FREAK SHOW So, you boys worship Christ? The guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond. 
HAROLD                           KUMAR Uh...Yeah.                        Sure, he's great. 
LIANE (a little offended) Oh, so just because we're passionate about our Lord, you assume we don't know how to have a good time? 
HAROLD No, I just... Liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. Harold and Kumar stare unabashedly. Harold looks outside the window, where he sees Freak Show changing the tire, apparently busy. 
HAROLD Nevermind. (to Kumar, swinging his hand) Okay, rock, paper, scissors... 
LIANE Sorry-- if you boys want me, you gotta do me at the same time. 
HAROLD Huh? 
LIANE Come on.   Give me the double stuff. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other confused. 
KUMAR I'm not sure we quite understand... 
LIANE I want you both inside me simultaneously. HAROLD and KUMAR look at each other again, more confused and kind of disturbed. Kumar turns to LIANE... 
KUMAR Um, are we talking about one hole or two? 
LIANE However you want to do it. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   61. 
HAROLD Sorry, no thank you. 
KUMAR (to Harold) Shh! Two holes it might not be that bad. (beat) Shotgun anus! 
HAROLD Forget it! I don't want our balls rubbing against each other. No way! KUMAR turns to LIANE in desperation... 
KUMAR What about blow jobs?! Can we get blow jobs!? 
LIANE Well...okay. (to Harold) Can you help me with this...? Liane walks over to Harold, seductively. Harold is nervous and doesn't know what he should do. She takes his hand and puts it on the knot in her shirt. Harold looks over to Kumar, who gives him a reassuring nod. Harold then pulls on the cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her shirt. The shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her breasts. 
LIANE (to Harold, re: breasts) Do you want to play with them? Harold looks over to Kumar, then back at Liane... 
HAROLD Okay, let's do that. Liane takes Harold's hands and places them on her breasts. Kumar looks on enviously. Liane moans in pleasure as Harold starts to massage her chest. AT THAT MOMENT, FREAK SHOW ENTERS THE ROOM, holding a particularly threatening TIRE-IRON... 
FREAK SHOW Hey boys-- I changed your tire... FREAK SHOW sees HAROLD with LIANE... 
FREAK SHOW What the hell are you doing with my wife! 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    62. 
HAROLD (scared shitless) Uhh...you said outside that we can have sex with her! FREAK SHOW runs over to HAROLD and grabs him by the collar! 
FREAK SHOW I most certainly did not say that! 
KUMAR No.   You did. We both heard you. 
FREAK SHOW (calming down) Are you sure? 
KUMAR Positive. FREAK SHOW ponders this. 
FREAK SHOW Oh...my mistake then. 
KUMAR No problem. 
FREAK SHOW Well, since we're all here, why not make it a foursome? 
FREAK SHOW PULLS HIS PANTS DOWN AND PUTS HIS ARMS AROUND 
HAROLD AND KUMAR... 
FREAK SHOW Who wants the first reach-around? 
84   EXT. FREAK SHOW'S HOUSE                                      84 HAROLD and KUMAR burst out the front door and run towards their car. They get in and peel out as fast as they can. 
85   EXT. DIRT ROAD - 1:45 AM                                     85 Harold's Infiniti is driving down a dusty trail in the woods. 
86   INT. HAROLD'S INFINITI                                       86 
KUMAR Okay, let's agree never to talk about what just happened. 
HAROLD Agreed. 
HAROLD (upset) Oh shit. These idiots. Cole and the Two Punks push past Harold and Kumar and walk into the store. Harold and Kumar enter after them... 
90   INT. CONVENIENCE STORE                                        90 HAROLD and KUMAR walk into the store, where they see Cole and the Punks are nonchalantly knocking over random items from the shelves. They then begin playing HACKEYSACK with a HOSTESS-like PIE. The CASHIER (an OLD INDIAN MAN IN HIS SIXTIES) throws out a couple indecipherable protests... 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    66. 
INDIAN CASHIER (to Cole and the punks) Please...the pies...do not... Cole and the Punks ignore him.    Harold and Kumar then approach the Indian Cashier... 
HAROLD Excuse me-- can you tell us how to get onto the highway from here? The INDIAN CASHIER shrugs his shoulders. 
KUMAR (to Harold) He probably can't speak English... 
KUMAR SAYS A FEW WORDS IN HINDI, WHICH LIGHTS UP THE CASHIER'S EYES. Kumar listens as the Cashier tells him the directions in Hindi-- it takes the Cashier a long time to explain it. He mentions numerous streets and routes. It sounds like it's very complicated. Meanwhile, while they are talking, HAROLD suddenly sees TWO MORE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS enter the store, CARRYING A KAYAK AND A PADDLE. They carry the kayak to the back of the store. Harold has no idea what the hell is going on. KUMAR and the CASHIER are too busy talking to notice. Harold watches nervously as COLE PUTS ON A HELMET AND GETS INTO THE KAYAK... 
KUMAR Who knew that learning Hindi would actually pay off? The guy says the highway's just down the road. We should be in Cherry Hill in ten minutes. HAROLD is still focused on COLE and the EXTREME PUNKS... 
HAROLD (to Kumar) Huh?   Oh, good. 
COLE (O.S.) 
EXTREME KAYAKING!!! HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER immediately turn and look at COLE, WHO IS IN THE KAYAK-- WHICH IS BEING HELD UP BY 
THE EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS. THE PUNKS RUN DOWN THE AISLE WITH 
THE KAYAK AND LAUNCH IT INTO THE AIR... In slow motion, we see COLE swing his paddle around in mid- air, KNOCKING OVER EVERYTHING ON THE SHELVES-- BAGS OF CHIPS, 
GLASS JARS OF JELLY, BOTTLES OF SODA, ETC. The EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS cheer COLE on, while HAROLD, KUMAR, and the INDIAN CASHIER watch in disbelief. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES     MAY 28 2003    67. 
The kayak lands on the floor.     COLE gets out and celebrates with his friends. 
COLE That was so fucking extreme, man! 
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Yeah man, on a scale from one to ten-- one being not so extreme, ten being extremely extreme, I'd give it a nine point five. Meanwhile, all the Extreme Sports Punks begin going crazy throughout the store, knocking food off the shelves, bothering other customers. The INDIAN CASHIER begins yelling at them in HINDI. Extreme   Sports Punk #1 casually looks through a shelf of various   kinds of snack chips, discarding them one after an other.    Finally, he stumbles upon EXTREME CHEDDAR DORITOS. He goes   apeshit over his find. 
EXTREME SPORTS PUNK #1 Extreme Cheddar! He tears open the bag and starts pouring them into his mouth, getting the chips all over the place. The INDIAN CASHIER is still yelling.      Cole picks up the Cashier... 
COLE Extreme Cashier!!! Harold and Kumar watch on as Cole spins the INDIAN CASHIER around and around. 
HAROLD Somebody should do something. 
KUMAR (to Cole) Hey asshole! Why don't you leave the guy alone and go jerk off to some snowboarding videos or something. 
EXTREME SPORTS PUNKS Oooooooooh! Pissed, Cole stops in his tracks and drops the Cashier on the floor. He's pissed. It's clear to Harold that they may get their asses kicked. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   68. 
HAROLD (to Kumar) I didn't mean you should do something. Cole slowly walks over to Kumar. The two stand face to face. Cole looks pissed, but Kumar keeps his confident exterior. It's a tense moment. Suddenly, Cole makes a quick motion as if he was going to hit Kumar, trying to get him to flinch. Kumar stands his ground without flinching, still looking Cole in the eye. The Punks don't know what to think as their leader is shown up. Seemingly impressed by Kumar, Cole begins to turn around as if he's going to walk away, but he quickly doubles back, doing the same fake punch he did before. Caught off guard, this time Kumar flinches like a nervous weakling... 
KUMAR (pissed off at himself) Shit. Cole and the Punks burst out laughing. 
COLE Yeah, that's right, bitch! Try fucking with me one more time. Just try it! Cole jumps up and town gloating and pounding on his chest. 
KUMAR (to Kumar, embarrassed) Come on, lets get out of here. Harold and Kumar walk out of the store, deflated.   With their leader victorious, the Punks begin celebrating. 
COLE (like Apu) Thank you, come again! 
91   EXT. GAS STATION/CONVENIENCE STORE                           91 HAROLD and KUMAR walk back towards their car... 
HAROLD Kumar-- you okay? 
KUMAR Yeah, I just hate those dicks. (beat) Fuck it. At least now we know where we're going. I'm so friggin' hungry... 
SUDDENLY, WE HEAR A CAR ENGINE START.    HAROLD AND KUMAR STOP 
WALKING AND LOOK OVER AT KUMAR'S CAR. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   69. 
THEY SEE NEIL IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT, TURNING THE KEY. THEY 
WATCH AS HE PUTS THE CAR INTO DRIVE, HITS THE GAS, AND TAKES 
KUMAR (to Officer Palumbo) Wait. Hold on.

DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003     72. KUMAR (cont'd) How can you give him a ticket for jaywalking? I mean, look at this street! He wasn't causing traffic or anything! 
HAROLD Kumar, shut up... 
OFFICER PALUMBO (to Kumar) Yeah, that's not the best tone to use on a cop who could bust your ass. 
KUMAR Bust my ass?! 
OFFICER PALUMBO Yeah, Koo-mar. Bust your ass. (to Harold) What's with that name -- Koo-mar -- with like three o's and shit. What happened to good old fashioned American names like Dave, Jim... Harold points to his ID. 
HAROLD Harold. Harold is starting to pacify Palumbo. 
OFFICER PALUMBO Yes. Harold. That's a great name.    You should be proud of that name, son. 
HAROLD Thank you. OFFICER PALUMBO hands Harold his ticket and begins to walk away. 
OFFICER PALUMBO As you were, ladies. Kumar grabs the ticket from Harold and looks at it. 
KUMAR 220 dollars!? Are you crazy? Palumbo quickly turns around and returns to the guys. 
HAROLD Kumar, I swear to God, if you don't... 
KUMAR (to Officer Palumbo) No, no, no. I understand what's going on. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   73. 
Harold steps in front of Kumar and puts his arms up to block him. Palumbo interprets the movement as a hostile movement towards him. 
OFFICER PALUMBO Hey, hands down! No sudden moves! Harold puts his hands down and Kumar continues his rant, with Palumbo improvising little responses. 
KUMAR Let me guess. You were probably the big asshole in your high school, right? You'd pick on guys like us every day. But then graduation came, and we went to college and you went nowhere, so you thought, "How can I still give them shit? I know! I'll become a cop!" Well, congratulations. Your dream's come true. Both Officer Palumbo and Harold are getting really pissed. Kumar steps in front of Harold and offers his friend over to Palumbo. 
KUMAR (to Officer Palumbo) Hey, while you're at it, why don't you write him up another ticket? Or better yet, arrest him. Lock him up! With that, HAROLD TAKES A BIG SWING AT KUMAR. Kumar sees Harold's fist coming and quickly ducks. Harold's fist ends up hitting OFFICER PALUMBO in the face. SMACK!!! 
HAROLD Oh shit. 
92   INT. JAIL CELL - 2:30 AM                                    92 The CELL DOOR SLAMS.    Harold is behind bars. 
HAROLD (calling out) Hey, are you gonna do something about my car? Hello? Palumbo is in the main office area, dealing with HIPPIE ASSHOLE and his MOM. The Mom hands Officer Palumbo a check. 
OFFICER PALUMBO Thanks, Mrs. Ogelthorpe. Your donation to our Police Charity is very appreciated. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003     74. 
HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S MOM Well, thank you for being so understanding about Bradley. I promise you he won't ever do it again. 
OFFICER PALUMBO Oh, I'm sure he won't. Not after the talk we had, right Brad? Officer Palumbo gives Hippie Asshole a threatening look. 
HIPPIE ASSHOLE (shaken) Mom-- please take me home... The Mom leaves, with Hippie Asshole clinging to her like a frightened child. Palumbo shakes his head and sits down at his desk, where we see HIPPIE ASSHOLE'S BIG BAG OF WEED, along with Harold's WALLET and LAPTOP. He then starts filing a report on Harold... Harold looks at Officer Palumbo through the bars... 
HAROLD Can I at least give you my car's licence plate number? Ignoring Harold, Palumbo turns up the volume on his radio... 
RADIO   ANNOUNCER The search for the   escaped cheetah continues tonight.   It was last spotted in Randolph Township,   heading South... Harold turns around and examines his cell. Inside with him is a black man (TARIK) sitting down, reading a book. Harold sits down, across from Tarik. While Harold isn't looking, we see Officer Palumbo take the cash out of Harold's wallet and pocket it. 
HAROLD So what are you in here for? 
TARIK For being black. 
HAROLD Come on.   Seriously. TARIK sits up. He looks at OFFICER PALUMBO who, with his Walkman on, is oblivious to their conversation. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003   75. 
TARIK I am serious. You wanna know what happened? Harold nods. 
TARIK I was walking out of a Barnes and Noble, and a cop stops me. Evidently, a black man robbed a store in Newark. Therefore, since I'm black, it was probably me, right? Harold shrugs his shoulders. 
TARIK Well that was the logic the cop used. I told him I haven't even been to Newark in months. Then he pointed a gun at me and told me to stop resisting arrest. I said, "Hey, I'm not resisting anything." So he starts beating me with his gun, screaming at me, telling me to stop resisting. 
HAROLD Holy shit.   What did you do? 
HAROLD How the hell should I know? 
KUMAR (O.C.) This isn't good. We hear the banging noise again. And again. Suddenly, THE 
VENTILATION SHAFT BREAKS OFF THE CEILING AND KUMAR FALLS OUT 
ONTO THE GROUND... 
HAROLD Jesus Christ. Tarik shakes his head. 
KUMAR Ow...my ass. Kumar gets up and walks over to the cell. 
KUMAR You sure you don't want to get out? 
HAROLD And become a fugitive? Are you nuts? The guy has all my information. Harold points to Palumbo's desk, which has the police report, Harold's I.D., and his laptop. 
KUMAR So what? We'll take everything he wrote down about you and leave. (beat) Unless you want to stay here all night and not be able to hand your work in tomorrow. Harold thinks about this for a second. 
HAROLD Fine.    Hurry up. Kumar smiles.   He begins searching for a key.

KUMAR Yes! I was hoping it would be one of these big ring of keys. Now I get to try all of them to see which one will... 
HAROLD Kumar, hurry the fuck up! Kumar runs over to the cell door. He tries out a couple keys, when he suddenly smells something... 
KUMAR What's that smell? Kumar turns his head and sees the ENORMOUS BAG OF WEED on Officer Reilly's desk. 
HAROLD Kumar?...Kumar! Kumar can't hear Harold. He's in a trance. We begin to hear a romantic song as Kumar stares lovingly at the BAG OF WEED...

The Bag of Weed throws the box in a GARBAGE CAN. Kumar lights a match and throws it in the can, setting it aflame. He and the bag of weed face each other and kiss...

102A   INT. KUMAR'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                              102A A NAKED KUMAR and THE BAG OF WEED are kissing in bed. The BAG OF WEED starts to go under the covers. We watch, as the sheets move up and down. KUMAR STARTS TO HAVE AN ORGASM... THE BAG OF WEED comes up from under the covers. Kumar gives it a kiss. THEN, HE GOES UNDER THE COVERS. We see THE BAG 
OF WEED START TO TREMBLE AND SHUDDER IN ECSTASY... 
103    INT. KITCHEN TABLE - AFTERNOON                             103 KUMAR (wearing a wife-beater undershirt and boxers) is frustrated as he looks at his BILLS. THE BAG OF WEED (wearing a pink bathrobe) comes out of the kitchen holding a MUG OF 
COFFEE. IT GIVES KUMAR THE COFFEE. KUMAR TAKES A SIP. IT'S 
TOO COLD. HE SPITS IT OUT AND SLAPS THE BAG OF WEED... 
DEPRESSED, THE BAG OF WEED WALKS AWAY FROM THE TABLE... KUMAR hears THE BAG OF WEED crying from the other room.   He obviously feels guilty... 
KUMAR Shhh. Suddenly, the CHEETAH OPENS HIS MOUTH WIDE AND CHOMPS DOWN ON 
WHAT APPEARS TO BE HAROLD'S GROIN AREA. 
HAROLD (eyes closed, screaming) 
HE'S MAULING ME! HE'S MAULING ME! HAROLD continues screaming for the next TEN SECONDS. Eventually, he calms down and looks at the CHEETAH. 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    84. 
THE CHEETAH IS NOT EATING HAROLD.    HE'S EATING THE BEEF JERKY 
THAT HAROLD HAD IN HIS PANTS. 
KUMAR (annoyed) I thought I told you not to take that jerky! HAROLD simply falls to the ground relieved that he hasn't been eaten. The Cheetah walks over to Harold and begins licking Harold's face in friendship. 
HAROLD He likes me. Suddenly, Kumar's eyes light up... 
KUMAR Dude, I think I have an idea. 
HAROLD What is it? 
KUMAR I'll tell you, but first we have to get really high. Kumar opens the bag of weed. Pan up to the night sky for a time lapse.   We see smoke coming up from below. Pan back down...

HAROLD Has it come to this?    Are we really gonna ride this cheetah? 
KUMAR Hey, cheetahs are the fastest animals on the planet. It's as good as a car. Kumar takes one last drag of a joint and flicks it away. 
HAROLD This is either a really smart move, or by far the stupidest thing we've ever done. HAROLD puts his arms around KUMAR to hold on.    Kumar puts the bag of weed under his shirt... 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003    85. 
KUMAR Well, we'll soon find out. (like to a snow dog) Mush! Mush! 
SUDDENLY, THE CHEETAH DARTS OUT LIKE LIGHTENING WITH HAROLD 
AND KUMAR ON IT'S BACK. EVEN THOUGH IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO 
SENSE, WE SEE THE CHEETAH ZOOMING PAST STREETS AND FORESTS. 
HAROLD AND KUMAR ARE BOUNCING UP AND DOWN AS IT RACES ACROSS 
A MAJOR HIGHWAY... 
HAROLD Dude, am I just really high or is this is actually working?! 
KUMAR Both! 
HAROLD This is great! We'll be at White Castle in no... 
SMACK! A BRANCH HITS HAROLD IN THE FACE, KNOCKING HIM OFF THE CHEETAH. Harold lands on the ground-- his head bleeding. His eyes slowly close as he goes unconscious...

109   EXT. THE LAND OF BURGERS - DAY                              109 THE LAND OF BURGERS is an OZ-like world-- the entire terrain, with all it's rolling hills, IS MADE UP OF HAMBURGERS. Music plays as HAROLD and MARIA skip through THE LAND OF BURGERS, holding hands. Along the way, they run by... The BLACK GUYS from the BASKETBALL GAME, all waltzing with each other, in white tuxedos. HUGEST ANGRIEST BLACK GUY gives Harold the same scary look from before.... FREAK SHOW is shoveling some burgers from the ground into a wheelbarrow. He waves to Harold and Maria. He then takes out a CHAINSAW and starts cutting off the arm he's waving with. KUMAR and the MALE NURSE, who are playing Twister, while getting high. After a spin of the wheel, Kumar reluctantly gets in a position where it looks like he's taking the Male Nurse from behind. Kumar's not happy. Harold and Maria fall to the ground-- they roll down a hill, UNTIL HAROLD IS ON TOP OF MARIA. Harold picks up a burger from the ground. Maria does the same. They proceed to feed each other their burgers. They munch on them, looking into each other's eyes... 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES   MAY 28 2003   86. 
MARIA I love you, Harold. 
HAROLD I love you, Maria. MARIA gets up and runs away. HAROLD playfully chases her. Maria runs over to a FRENCH FRY TREE. SHE PLUCKS A COUPLE 
FRENCH FRIES FROM THE BRANCH AND FEEDS THEM TO HAROLD. 
COLE (O.S.) Wow, you guys are really extreme... HAROLD turns and sees COLE KAYAKING DOWN A NEARBY STREAM... 
COLE ...extremely gay that is. 
SUDDENLY, AN ARROW GOES RIGHT THROUGH COLE'S NECK! BLOOD 
KUMAR Oh shit! KUMAR turns around and sees the police car behind them.

KUMAR What are you doing?! 
HAROLD I'm not going back to jail!     We've come too far! Now buckle up.

OFFICER BRUCKS What the hell? He puts his foot on the brakes, bringing the car to a screeching halt. OFFICER BRUCKS gets out of the car and looks around wondering where the YELLOW JEEP went. HE THEN HEARS THE SOUND OF 
BRANCHES CRACKING IN THE WOODS...

HAROLD Don't worry. We're gonna make it. Everything's gonna be... 
THEY NOTICE THEY'RE ABOUT TO DRIVE OVER THE EDGE OF A CLIFF. 
HAROLD                             KUMAR Shit!                               Fuck!

SUDDENLY, KUMAR SEES SOMETHING OUT IN THE DISTANCE... 
KUMAR (pointing) Rold! Look out there! 
HAROLD LOOKS TO WHERE KUMAR IS POINTING-- IT'S A WHITE CASTLE 
WAY DOWN BELOW, ABOUT A MILE AWAY. 
THEY THEN HEAR A POLICE SIREN COMING FROM BACK IN THE WOODS. 
HAROLD Oh shit!   We're trapped! Kumar notices something... 
KUMAR Not necessarily. KUMAR walks over to the JEEP and points to the HANG-GLIDER... 
HAROLD No. No way. Not a chance.       I'd rather turn myself in than die. 
HAROLD Oh my God!    Oh my God!   Oh my God! 
KUMAR Dude, it's working! 
HAROLD I can't believe you lied to me!

OFFICER BRUCKS (to the walkie-talkie) It appears they've escaped. They ditched their jeep. OFFICER BRUCKS opens the front door of the car and peers inside. He notices THE BAG OF WEED ON THE DASHBOARD. He opens it and TASTES SOME WEED in the same way a drug cop would taste cocaine during a bust. 
OFFICER BRUCKS (to the walkie-talkie) Good news. I found enough dope in the car to send those skateboard punks to jail for the next couple years. Looks like they've terrorized their last convenience store. Suddenly, Officer Brucks realizes that the taste in his mouth is strangely appealing. He thinks for a beat as he eyes the bag of weed. He then takes another taste of it. He looks again at the bag. Like Kumar, we can tell that he's in love...

HAROLD Dude, we're so high right now. 
KUMAR We're not low. They continue gliding though the sky for a while... 
HAROLD Hey, Kumar? 
KUMAR Yeah? 
HAROLD How are we gonna get down? 
KUMAR Uh...well...I guess it's just gonna go down at some point. 
HAROLD That's a great answer. Made me feel really comfortable. Thanks a lot. KUMAR looks down as they fly over a playground. 
HAROLD Is it a problem if we fly into birds? 
KUMAR Why do you ask? 
DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES    MAY 28 2003    101. 
HAROLD Because we're about to! KUMAR looks up and sees at least A HUNDRED CROWS FLYING 
STRAIGHT TOWARDS THEM.

HAROLD Ahhhh!   My eyes! Don't peck out my eyes!

SNAP!!! THE BRANCH BREAKS OFF, SENDING HAROLD AND KUMAR 
BILLY Harold?   What are you...?

J.D. hears the commotion and turns around... 
J.D. Hey! What the hell is going on here? 
HAROLD Back off, cock boy! What I have to say to him goes double for you! KUMAR sees what's going on-- he can't believe it. 
J.D. Cock boy? I'm sorry, but did you just call me "cock boy?" 
HAROLD Yeah, you know I did. You're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback. 
J.D. Oh, I'm not quick enough? (to Billy) He thinks I'm not quick enough. (to Harold) Well, I got news for you... (long beat, thinking) I am quick enough... (beat) ...cock boy! J.D. is embarrassed. BILLY tries to placate the situation. 
BILLY Listen Harry... 
J.D. (to Billy) Don't even bother with him.   We'll just tell Berenson later... 
HAROLD Tell him what? That I'm your work horse! That you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet Asian guy in your office! Huh? J.D. is stunned.   Now he's a little nervous. 
J.D. No, no-- you don't understand... 
HAROLD No, YOU don't understand. I'm not doing your work anymore.

DOUBLE WHITE REVISED PAGES MAY 28 2003       110. HAROLD (cont'd) And if either one of you douchebags ever tries to pull this shit again, I'll go to Berenson and tell him what's really going on. Harold notices Traci and Zoe listening... 
HAROLD And I'll tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore. TRACI and ZOE hear this and are freaked out.   They slowly back away from BILLY and J.D.... 
HAROLD Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to get going. See you on Monday. HAROLD leaves the RESTAURANT. KUMAR follows.     Billy and J.D. are left embarrassed and in shock.

HAROLD I don't know. Eating those delicious burgers made me feel like a new man. Now I'm actually looking forward to work this week. 
KUMAR No shit! I guess you're worthwhile after all.

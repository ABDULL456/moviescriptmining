Screenplay by Richard Curtis 
Title 
EXT. VARIOUS DAYS 
'She' plays through the credits. 
Exquisite footage of Anna Scott -- the great movie star of our time -- an ideal -- the perfect star and woman -- her life full of glamour and sophistication and mystery. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
Mix through to William, 35, relaxed, pleasant, informal.  We follow him as he walks down Portobello Road, carrying a load of bread.  It is spring. 
WILLIAM (V.O.) Of course, I've seen her films and always thought she was, well, fabulous -- but, you know, million miles from the world I live in.  Which is here -- Notting Hill -- not a bad place to be... 
EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY 
It's a full fruit market day. 
WILLIAM (V.O.) There's the market on weekdays, selling every fruit and vegetable known to man... 
EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY 
A man in denims exits the tattoo studio. 
WILLIAM (V.O.) The tattoo parlour -- with a guy outside who got drunk and now can't remember why he chose 'I Love Ken'... 
EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY 
WILLIAM (V.O.) The racial hair-dressers where everyone comes out looking like the Cookie Monster, whether they like it or not... 
Sure enough, a girl exits with a huge threaded blue bouffant. 
EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - SATURDAY 
WILLIAM (V.O.) Then suddenly it's the weekend, and from break of day, hundreds of stalls appears out of nowhere, filling Portobello Road right up to Notting Hill Gate... 
A frantic crowded Portobello market. 
WILLIAM (V.O.) ... and thousands of people buy millions of antiques, some genuine... 
The camera finally settles on a stall selling beautiful stained glass windows of various sizes, some featuring biblical scenes and saints. 
WILLIAM (V.O.) ... and some not so genuine. 
EXT. GOLBORNE ROAD - DAY 
WILLIAM (V.O.) And what's great is that lots of friends have ended up in this part of London -- that's Tony, architect turned chef, who recently invested all the money he ever earned in a new restaurant... 
Shot of Tony proudly setting out a board outside his restaurant, the sign still being painted.  He receives and approves a huge fresh salmon. 
EXT. PORTOBELLO ROAD - DAY 
WILLIAM (V.O.) So this is where I spend my days and years -- in this small village in the middle of a city -- in a house with a blue door that my wife and I bought together... before she left me for a man who looked like Harrison Ford, only even handsomer... 
We arrive outside his blue-doored house just off Portobello. 
WILLIAM (V.O.) ... and where I now lead a strange half-life with a lodger called... 
INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - DAY 
WILLIAM Spike! 
The house has far too many things in it.  Definitely two- bachelor flat. 
Spike appears.  An unusual looking fellow.  He has unusual hair, unusual facial hair and an unusual Welsh accent: very white, as though his flesh has never seen the sun.  He wears only shorts. 
SPIKE Even he.  Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you? 
ANNA Really? 
WILLIAM Yes.  This one though is... very good. 
He picks up a book on the counter. 
WILLIAM I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab. 
ANNA Thanks.  I'll think about it. 
William suddenly spies something odd on the small TV monitor beside him. 
WILLIAM If you could just give me a second. 
Her eyes follow him as he moves toward the back of the shop and approaches a man in slightly ill-fitting clothes. 
WILLIAM Excuse me. 
THIEF Yes. 
WILLIAM Bad news. 
THIEF What? 
WILLIAM We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop. 
THIEF So? 
WILLIAM So, I saw you put that book down your trousers. 
THIEF What book? 
WILLIAM The one down your trousers. 
THIEF I haven't got a book down my trousers. 
WILLIAM Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse.  I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,  what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize. 
THIEF Okay -- what if I did have a book down my trousers? 
WILLIAM Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it.  See you in a sec. 
He returns to his desk.  In the monitor we just glimpse, as does William, the book coming out of the trousers and put back on the shelves.  The thief drifts out towards the door.  Anna, who has observed all this, is looking at a blue book on the counter. 
WILLIAM Sorry about that... 
ANNA No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see. 
WILLIAM Yes, we couldn't stop him.  If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune. 
She smiles.  Suddenly the thief is there. 
THIEF Excuse me. 
ANNA Yes. 
THIEF Can I have your autograph? 
ANNA What's your name? 
THIEF Rufus. 
She signs his scruffy piece of paper.  He tries to read it. 
THIEF What does it say? 
ANNA Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.' 
THIEF Nice one.  Would you like my phone number? 
ANNA Tempting but... no, thank you. 
He jumps back. 
WILLIAM Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up. 
ANNA No thank you.  I need to get my car back. 
WILLIAM I also have a phone.  I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously. 
In his diffident way, he is confident, despite her being genuinely annoyed.  She turns and looks at him. 
ANNA Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards. 
WILLIAM Eighteen yards.  That's my house there. 
He doesn't lie -- it is eighteen yards away.  She looks down. She looks up at him. 
INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CORRIDOR - DAY 
They enter.  She carries a few stylish bags. 
WILLIAM Come on in.  I'll just... 
William runs in further -- it's a mess.  He kicks some old shoes under the stairs, bins an unfinished pizza and hides a plate of breakfast in a cupboard.  She enters the kitchen. 
WILLIAM It's not that tidy, I fear. 
And he guides her up the stairs, after taking the bag of books from her... 
WILLIAM The bathroom is right at the top of the stairs and there's a phone on the desk up there. 
She heads upstairs. 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
William is tidying up frantically.  Then he hears Anna's feet on the stairs.  She walks down, wearing a short, sparkling black top beneath her leather jacket.  With her trainers still on.  He is dazzled by the sight of her. 
WILLIAM Would you like a cup of tea before you go? 
ANNA No thanks. 
WILLIAM Coffee? 
ANNA No. 
WILLIAM Orange juice -- probably not. 
He moves to his very empty fridge -- and offers its only contents. 
WILLIAM Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest? 
ANNA Really, no. 
WILLIAM Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them. 
ANNA No. 
WILLIAM Do you always say 'no' to everything? 
Pause.  She looks at him deep. 
ANNA No. (pause) I better be going.  Thanks for your help. 
WILLIAM You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly. 
It has taken a lot to get this out loud.  He is not a smooth- talking man. 
WILLIAM Take my one chance to say it.  After you've read that terrible book, you're certainly not going to be coming back to the shop. 
She smiles.  She's cool. 
ANNA Thank you. 
MICHAEL Smile. 
ANNA No. 
MICHAEL Smile. 
ANNA I've got nothing to smile about. 
MICHAEL Okay in about 7 seconds, I'm going to ask you to marry me. 
And after a couple of seconds -- wow -- she smiles. 
INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
SPIKE Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her. 
WILLIAM Yes, she is fairly fabulous. 
INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY 
The next day.  William and Martin quietly co-existing.  An annoy- ing customer enters.  Mr. Smith. 
MR. SMITH Do you have any books by Dickens? 
WILLIAM No, we're a travel bookshop.  We only sell travel books. 
MR. SMITH Oh right.  How about that new John Grisham thriller? 
WILLIAM No, that's a novel too. 
MR. SMITH Oh right.  Have you got a copy of 'Winnie the Pooh'? 
Pause. 
WILLIAM Martin -- your customer. 
MARTIN Can I help you? 
William looks up.  At that moment the entire window is suddenly taken up by the huge side of a bus, obscuring the light -- and entirely covered with a portrait of Anna -- from her new film, 'Helix.' 
INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE - CONDOR/LIVING ROOM - DAY 
William heads upstairs and pauses.  Spike coming down, wearing full body scuba diving gear. 
SPIKE Hey. 
WILLIAM Hi... 
INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN - DAY 
The two of them fixing a cup of tea in the kitchen. 
WILLIAM Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that? 
SPIKE Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes... 
WILLIAM There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes. 
SPIKE Right.  Vicious circle.  And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey. 
EXT. WILLIAM'S TERRACE - DAY 
The two of them on the rooftop terrace, passing the day. William is reading 'The bookseller.'  The terrace is small and the plants aren't great -- but it overlooks London in a rather wonderful way.  Spike still in scuba gear, goggles on. 
SPIKE There's something wrong with the goggles though... 
WILLIAM No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly. 
SPIKE Groovy.  You should do more of this stuff. 
WILLIAM So -- any messages? 
ANNA (V.O.) Hi. 
We hear her voice -- don't see her. 
WILLIAM (caught out) Oh hi.  It's William Thacker.  We, ahm I work in a bookshop. 
ANNA (V.O.) You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call. 
WILLIAM No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life.  Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message. 
ANNA (V.O.) Oh -- Okay. 
WILLIAM Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something? 
ANNA (V.O.) Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good. 
WILLIAM Right.  Great. (he hangs up) Classic.  Classic. 
EXT. RITZ - DAY 
William jumps off a bus and walks toward the Ritz.  He carries a small bunch of roses. 
INT. RITZ HOTEL - DAY 
He approaches the lifts.  At the lift, he pushes the button and the doors open.  As he is getting in, William is joined by a young man.  His name is Tarquin. 
WILLIAM Which floor? 
TARQUIN Three. 
William pushes the button.  They wait for the doors to close. 
INT. RITZ CORRIDOR - DAY 
The lift lands.  William gets out.  So does Tarquin.  Rooms 30-35 are to the left.  35-39 to the right.  William heads right. So does Tarquin. 
William is puzzled.  He slows down as he approaches room 38.  So does Tarquin.  William spots, so does Tarquin.  William points at the number. 
WILLIAM Are you sure you...? 
TARQUIN Yes. 
WILLIAM Oh.  Right. 
He knocks.  A bright, well-tailored American girl opens the door. 
KAREN Hello, I'm Karen.  Sorry -- things are running a bit late.  Here's the thing... 
She hands them a very slick, expensively produced press kits, with the poster picture of Anna, for the film 'Helix.' 
INT. THE TRAFALGAR SUITE ANTE-ROOM - DAY 
A few seconds later -- they enter the main waiting room.  There are a number of journalists waiting for their audience. 
KAREN What did you think of the film? 
TARQUIN Marvellous.  'Close Encounters' meets 'Jean De Florette.'  Oscar- winning stuff. 
They both turn to William for his opinion. 
WILLIAM I agree. 
KAREN I'm sorry.  I didn't get down what magazines you're from. 
TARQUIN 'Time Out.' 
KAREN Great.  And you... 
WILLIAM (seeing it on a coffee table) 'Horse and Hound.'  The name's William Whacker.  I think she might be expecting me. 
KAREN Okay -- take a seat.  I'll check. 
WILLIAM I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do. 
ANNA No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it. 
WILLIAM Absolutely fine about it. 
Re-enter Jeremy. 
JEREMY Do remember that Miss Scott is also keen to talk about her next project, which is shooting later in the summer. 
WILLIAM Oh yes -- excellent.  Ahm -- any horses in that one?  Or hounds, of course.  Our readers are equally intrigued by both species. ANNA It takes place on a submarine. 
WILLIAM Yes.  Right... But if there were horses, would you be riding them yourself or would you be getting a stunt horse person double sort of thing? 
Jeremy exits. 
WILLIAM I'm just a complete moron.  Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life.  Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you. 
ANNA And what happens next in the dream? 
It's a challenge. 
WILLIAM Well, I suppose in the dream dream scenario.  I just... ahm, change my personality, because you can do that in dreams, and  walk across and kiss the girl but you know it'll never happen. 
Pause.  Then they move towards each other when... Jeremy enters. 
JEREMY Time's up, I'm afraid.  Sorry it was so short.  Did you get what you wanted? 
WILLIAM Very nearly. 
JEREMY Maybe time for one last question? 
WILLIAM Right. 
Jeremy goes out -- it's their last seconds. 
WILLIAM Are you busy tonight? 
ANNA Yes. 
They look at each other.  Jeremy enters, with another journalists in tow.  Anna and William stand and shake hands formally. 
ANNA Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice. 
WILLIAM Thank you.  You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress.  You and Black Beauty.  Tied. 
INT. TRAFALGAR SUITE CORRIDOR - DAY 
William exits fairly despondent and heads for the door.  Tarquin is in the corridor calling on his mobile phone. 
TARQUIN How was she? 
WILLIAM Fabulous. 
TARQUIN Wait a minute -- she took your grandmother's flowers? 
William can't think his way out of this. 
WILLIAM Yes.  That's right.  Bitch. 
He turns to go, but is accosted by Karen. 
KAREN If you'd like to come with me we can rush you through the others. 
WILLIAM The others? 
INT. RITZ INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY 
KAREN Mr. Thacker's from 'Horse and Hound.' 
A forty-year-old actor with great presence warmly shakes William's hand. 
ANNA Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist. 
WILLIAM Oh well, great.  Perfect.  Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner. 
ANNA Okay -- fine. 
WILLIAM But no, I'm sure I can get out of it. 
ANNA No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date. 
WILLIAM You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party? 
ANNA If that's all right. 
WILLIAM I'm sure it's all right.  My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something. 
ANNA Okay. 
WILLIAM Okay. 
INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Bella and Max are in the kitchen. 
MAX He's bringing a girl? 
BELLA Miracles do happen. 
MAX Does the girl have a name? 
BELLA He wouldn't say. 
MAX Christ, what is going on in there? 
The oven seems to be smoking a little.  Then the bell rings. 
MAX (cont'd) Oh God. 
It's bad timing.  Max shoots out of the kitchen. 
INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Max heads for the door impatiently.  He opens it and turns back without looking at William and Anna standing there. 
MAX Come on in.  Vague food crisis. 
William and Anna move along the corridor to the kitchen. 
INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Bella is there. 
BELLA Hiya -- sorry -- the guinea fowl is proving more complicated than expected. 
WILLIAM He's cooking guinea fowl? 
BELLA Don't even ask. 
ANNA Hi. 
BELLA Hi.  Good Lord -- you're the spitting image of... 
WILLIAM Bella -- this is Anna. 
BELLA Right. (pause) 
MAX Okay.  Crisis over. 
He rises from his stove position. 
WILLIAM Max.  This is Anna. 
MAX 'No comment' means 'yes.' 
WILLIAM No, it doesn't. 
MAX Do you ever masturbate? 
WILLIAM Definitely no comment. 
MAX You see -- it means 'yes.' 
Then on to Bernie's conversation. 
BERNIE So tell me Anna -- what do you do? 
ANNA I'm an actress. 
BERNIE Splendid.  I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that.  'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.'  Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they? 
ANNA Well, they can be. 
BERNIE I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life.  What sort of acting do you do? 
ANNA Films mainly. 
BERNIE Oh splendid.  Well done.  How's the pay in movies?  I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid? 
ANNA Fifteen million dollars. 
BERNIE Right.  Right.  So that's... fairly good.  On the high side... have you tried the nuts? 
MAX Right -- I think we're ready. 
They all move towards the kitchen. 
ANNA (to Bella) I wonder if you could tell me where the...? 
BELLA Oh, it's just down the corridor on the right. 
HONEY I'll show you. 
A moment's silence as they leave -- then in a split second the others all turn to William. 
BELLA Quickly, quickly -- talk very quickly what are you doing here with Anna Scott? 
BERNIE Anna Scott? 
BELLA Yes. 
BERNIE The movie star? 
BELLA Yup. 
BERNIE Oh God.  Oh God.  Oh Goddy God. 
The horror of his remembered conversation slowly unfolds. Honey re-enters. 
HONEY I don't believe it.  I walked into the loo with her.  I was still talking when she started unbuttoning her jeans... She had to ask me to leave. 
INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT 
A little later.  They are sat at dinner.  Bella next to Anna. 
BELLA What do you think of the guinea fowl? 
ANNA (whispering) I'm a vegetarian. 
BELLA Oh God. 
INT. MAX AND BELLA'S CONSERVATORY - NIGHT 
Moving on through the evening -- they are very relaxed, as they eat dinner.  A few seconds watching the evening going well -- Anna is taking this in -- real friends -- relaxed -- easy, teasing. And there's a cake.  Honey wears Bernie's unsuitable hat.  Anna watches William laughing at something and then putting his head in his hands with mock shame. 
WILLIAM Pathetic effort to hog the brownie. 
INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Anna and William are leaving. 
ANNA That was such a great evening. 
MAX I'm delighted. 
He holds out his hand to shake.  She kisses him on the cheek. He stumbles back with joy. 
ANNA And may I say that's a gorgeous tie. 
MAX Now you're lying. 
ANNA You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting. 
Max loves this. 
ANNA (to Bella) Lovely to meet you. 
BELLA And you.  I'll wait till you've gone before I tell him you're a vegetarian. 
MAX No! 
ANNA Night, night, Honey. 
HONEY I'm so sorry about the loo thing. I meant to leave but I just... look, ring me if you need someone to go shopping with.  I know lots of nice, cheap places... not that money necessarily... (gives up) nice to meet you. 
And Honey gives her a huge hug. 
ANNA You too -- from now on you are my style guru. 
Anna and William head out... Bernie tries to save some dignity. 
BERNIE Love your work. 
They move to the door and wave goodbye. 
EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
William and Anna step outside.  From inside they hear a massive and hysterical scream of the friends letting out their true feelings.  William is a little embarrassed. 
WILLIAM Sorry -- they always do that when I leave the house. 
The house is in Lansdowne Road, on the edge of Notting Hill. They walk for a moment.  A bit of silence. 
ANNA Floppy, huh? 
WILLIAM It's the hair!  It's to do with the hair. 
ANNA Why is she in a wheelchair? 
WILLIAM It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago. 
ANNA And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident? 
WILLIAM You know, I'm not sure.  I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it. 
They walk in silence for a moment.  Then... 
WILLIAM Would you like to come... my house is just...? 
She smiles and shakes her head. 
ANNA Too complicated. 
WILLIAM That's fine. 
ANNA Busy tomorrow? 
She leans forward -- and, for the firs time since the first time -- she kisses him.  This time a proper kiss.  A tiny pause. 
WILLIAM Nice garden. 
EXT. MAGIC GARDEN - NIGHT 
They walk around the garden.  It's a moonlit dream.  We see the lights of the houses that surround the garden.  They come across a single, simple wooden bench. 
ANNA 'For June, who loved this garden -- from Joseph who always sat beside her.' 
We cut in and see an inscription carved into the wood.  She doesn't read the dates, carved below -- 'June Wetherby, 1917 - 1992.'  She is slightly chocked by it. 
ANNA Some people do spend their whole lives together. 
He nods.  They are standing on either side of the bench, looking at each other.  The camera glides away from them, up into the night sky, leaving them alone in the garden.  Music plays. 
INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
William in a towel rushes downstairs, having just had a shower. He shoots past Spike. 
WILLIAM Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks.  Have you seen my glasses? 
SPIKE No, 'fraid not. 
WILLIAM Bollocks. (still searching -- with no help from Spike) This happens every time I go to the cinema.  Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses.  But the moment I need them they disappear.  It's one of life's real cruelties. 
SPIKE That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer? 
WILLIAM Oh shit, is that the time?  I have to go. 
INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM/CORRIDOR - EVENING 
He sprints downstairs, now fully dressed. 
WILLIAM (not meaning it) Thanks for your help on the glasses thing. 
SPIKE (sincerely) You're welcome.  Did you find them? 
WILLIAM Sort of. 
INT. CINEMA - NIGHT 
Mid-film.  We move across the audience.  And there is in the middle of it, we see Anna, watching the screen, and next to her, William, watching the film keenly, through his scuba- diving goggles. 
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
A very smart Japanese restaurant.  We see Anna and William sitting, near the end of their meal. 
ANNA So who left who? 
WILLIAM She left me. 
ANNA Why? 
WILLIAM She saw through me. 
ANNA Uh-oh.  That's not good. 
We've been aware of the conversation at a nearby table -- now we can hear it.  Two slightly rowdy men. 
LAWRENCE No - No- No!  Give me Anna Scott any day. 
William and Anna look at each other. 
GERALD I didn't like that last film of hers. Fast asleep from the moment the lights went down. 
Again -- Anna reacts. 
LAWRENCE Don't really care what the films are like.  Any film with her in it -- fine by me. 
GERALD No -- not my type at all really.  I prefer that other one -- blonde -- sweet looking -- has an orgasm every time you take her out for a cup of coffee. 
Mix through -- William sits on the couch downstairs -- eyes wide open -- thinking. 
INT. MAX AND BELLA'S KITCHEN/LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Morning.  Max, all in his suit for the city... Bella kisses him goodbye.  William sees this from the kitchen.  She is also dressed for work -- and moves back into the kitchen to pack her briefcase with law books from the kitchen table. 
EXT. MAX AND BELLA'S HOUSE - DAY 
William emerges from the house, a little ruffled from a night away from home, a heads off. 
EXT. NEWSAGENT - DAY 
William walks past the newsagent, heading for home.  We see, though he doesn't, a rack of tabloid papers, all of which seem to have very grainy, grabbed pictures of Anna on their front page.  Headlines --'Anna Stunna'-- 'It's Definitely Her!' and 'Scott of Pantartica.' 
INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY 
William is shaving.  The bell goes.  He heads out to answer it. 
EXT./INT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -DAY 
William arrives at the door and opens it.  There stands a dark- glassed Anna. 
ANNA Hi.  Can I come in? 
WILLIAM Come in. 
She moves inside.  Her hair is a mess -- her eyes are tired. Nothing idealized. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The two of them. 
ANNA They were taken years ago -- I know it was... well, I was poor and it happens a lot -- that's not an excuse -- but to make things worse, it now appears someone was filming me as well.  So what was a stupid photo- shoot now looks like a porno film. And well... the pictures have been solid and they're everywhere. 
William shakes his head. 
ANNA I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded. 
WILLIAM This is the place. 
ANNA Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be. 
She's very shaken. 
ANNA These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like... 
WILLIAM Don't think about it.  We'll sort it out.  Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...? 
ANNA A bath would be great. 
INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY 
Spike enters through the front door.  William doesn't hear him. Spike is reading newspapers with the Anna pictures in it. 
SPIKE Christ alive... brilliant... fantastic .... magnificent... 
He heads up the stairs.  Opens the bathroom door, walks in. 
INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY 
Spike heads for the toilet -- undoes his zip... 
ANNA You must be Spike. 
She's in the bath.  Spike turns in shock -- and sidles out of the bathroom. 
INT. WILLIAM'S CORRIDOR - DAY 
Spike calms himself down.  He then opens the bathroom door again -- and looks in. 
INT. WILLIAM'S BATHROOM - DAY 
WILLIAM Brilliant. (the scene's over) Word perfect I'd say. 
ANNA What do you think? 
WILLIAM Gripping.  It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping. 
ANNA You think I should do Henry James instead? 
WILLIAM I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too. 
ANNA Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.' 
WILLIAM And I think the book is the poorer for it. 
Anna smiles her biggest smile of the day.  He is helping. 
INT. WILLIAM'S DINING ROOM 
Anna and William.  Sat down at table.  There's a picture hanging on the wall behind. 
ANNA I can't believe you have that picture on your wall. 
It is a poster of a Chagall painting of a floating wedding couple, with a goat as company. 
WILLIAM You like Chagall? 
ANNA I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky. 
WILLIAM With a goat playing a violin. 
ANNA Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat. 
Spike enters with three pizzas. 
SPIKE Voila.  Carnival Calypso, for the Queen of Notting Hill -- pepperoni, pineapple and a little more pepperoni. 
ANNA Fantastic. 
WILLIAM I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I? 
SPIKE (pause) I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect. 
INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Later in the evening.  William and Anna on their own.  They're sipping coffee.  A few seconds of just co-existing.  Anna looks up. 
ANNA You've got big feet. 
WILLIAM Yes.  Always have had. 
ANNA You know what they say about men with big feet? 
WILLIAM No.  What's that? 
ANNA Big feet -- large shoes. 
He laughs. 
INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A few hours later -- eating ice-cream out of the tub. 
ANNA The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses. 
WILLIAM You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity? 
ANNA Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.' 
WILLIAM You have a stunt bottom? 
ANNA I could have a stunt bottom, yes. 
The darkness of the living room.  We see Anna in the shadow. 
INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
A few moments later.  William and Anna stand in the middle of the room.  He kisses her neck.  Then her shoulder.  What a miracle it is just to be able to touch this girl's skin.  Then he looks at her face.  That face.  He is suddenly struck by who it is. 
WILLIAM Wow. 
ANNA What? 
And then gets over it straight away. 
WILLIAM Nothing. 
And kisses her. 
INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The middle of the night.  They are both asleep -- a yard apart. In sleep, her arm reaches out, touches his shoulder and then she wriggles across and re-settles herself, tenderly, right next to him.  He is not asleep and knows how extraordinary this all is. 
INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY 
The morning. 
WILLIAM It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked. 
ANNA You and every person in this country. 
WILLIAM Oh God yes -- I'm sorry. 
ANNA What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them? 
WILLIAM Well... 
ANNA No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them... 
WILLIAM More than that actually, when you think about it.  You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair... 
ANNA But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about? 
WILLIAM (pause) Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look... 
He looks under the sheet at her breasts. 
WILLIAM No, beats me. 
She laughs... 
ANNA Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that? 
WILLIAM Who was Gilda? 
ANNA Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me? 
WILLIAM (pause) You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been. 
ANNA (very touched) Oh. 
She looks at him carefully.  Then leaps out of bed. 
ANNA I'll be back. 
INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
William on the bed.  The door opens.  It is Anna with a tray of toast and tea. 
ANNA Breakfast in bed.  Or lunch, or brunch. 
She heads across.  She smiles and sits on the bed. 
ANNA Can I stay a bit longer? 
WILLIAM I don't know what happened. 
ANNA I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was. 
She's packing. 
WILLIAM That's not true. 
ANNA Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear. 
SPIKE (dropping in) I went out in my goddamn underwear too. 
WILLIAM Get out, Spike. (he does) I'm so sorry. 
ANNA This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend. 
WILLIAM You do? 
It's a difficult moment -- defining where they stand. 
ANNA As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu. 
WILLIAM I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm... 
ANNA You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.' 
WILLIAM That's spectacularly unfair. 
ANNA Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott. 
She heads out. 
INT. STAIRS/LIVING ROOM - DAY 
WILLIAM Now stop.  Stop.  I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea. 
ANNA I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home. 
The doorbell goes. 
WILLIAM Spike, check who that is... and for God's sake put some clothes on. 
Spike leans merrily out of the window. 
SPIKE Looks like a chauffeur to me. 
INT. WILLIAM'S KITCHEN/CORRIDOR - DAY 
They move from the kitchen into the corridor. 
ANNA And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal. 
WILLIAM That's not true.  And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior.  Can't we just laugh about this?  Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter. 
SPIKE What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan. 
WILLIAM Well, there are.  And we don't need to go anywhere near that far.  My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective. 
ANNA You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different. 
WILLIAM I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins. 
ANNA Excuse me? 
WILLIAM Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow. 
ANNA You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever. 
He takes this in.  That's the end. 
WILLIAM Right.  Fine.  I will do the opposite, if it's all right by you -- and always be glad you came.  But you're right -- you probably better go. 
They toast him. 
HONEY Since it's an evening of announcements ... I've also got one, Ahm... I've decided to get engaged. 
Total bewilderment from the others. 
HONEY I've found myself a nice, slightly odd looking bloke who I know is going to make me happy for the rest of my life. 
Special cut to Bernie -- the shot shows he had special feelings for Honey. 
WILLIAM Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this. 
MAX Is it someone we know? 
HONEY Yes.  I will keep you informed. 
As she sits down, Honey leans towards Spike and whispers. 
HONEY By the way -- it's you. 
SPIKE Me? 
HONEY Yes.  What do you think? 
SPIKE Well, yes.  Groovy. 
MAX Any more announcements? 
WILLIAM Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months.  I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth. 
MAX There's an understatement.  There are dead people on better form. 
WILLIAM But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy. 
INT. TONY'S RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Two hours later.  They've had a very good time.  There's been a chocolate cake.  Lots of alcohol.  Tony is playing 'Blue Moon' on the piano, and Bernie joins him, singing. 
At one table Bella and Honey sit -- beer and wine on the table. 
BELLA I'm really horribly drunk. 
Elsewhere, Max an William are relaxed together. 
MAX So -- you've laid the ghost. 
WILLIAM I believe I have. 
MAX Don't give a damn about the famous girl. 
WILLIAM No, don't think I do. 
MAX Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath. 
He puts down a copy of the 'Evening Standard' with a picture of Anna on its cover. 
WILLIAM (immediate gloom) Oh God no. 
MAX So not over her, in fact. 
EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY 
Cut to the wide sweep of Hampstead Heath.  William entirely alone.  He marches up a hill... goes over the crest of it -- and sees a huge film crew and hundreds of extras in front of the radiant white of Kenwood House, with its lawn and its lakes. 
EXT. KENWOOD HOUSE - DAY 
Now closer to the house, William approaches a barrier -- where he is himself approached. 
SECURITY Can I help you? 
WILLIAM Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott... 
JAMES No, but seriously -- it's not fair -- so many tragic young teenagers with anorexia -- and that girl has an arse she could perfectly well share round with at least ten other women -- and still be beg-bottomed. 
ANNA I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet. 
Back by the desk, William is listening and laughs.  That's his girl.  Anna prepares. 
ANNA So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...? 
JAMES 'Tomorrow will be soon enough.' 
ANNA And then I... right. 
JAMES Who was that rather difficult chap you were talking to on the way up? 
ANNA Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation. 
EXT. HAMPSTEAD HEATH - DAY 
Cut back to William -- he has heard. 
WILLIAM Of course. 
He takes off the headphones and puts them gently down. 
WILLIAM Thank you. 
HARRY Anytime. 
William walks away.  The moment of hope is gone.  He couldn't have had a clear reminder. 
INT. WILLIAM'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
William is emptying Anna Scott videos into a box. 
SPIKE What's going on? 
WILLIAM I'm going to throw out these old videos. 
SPIKE No.  You can't bin these.  They're classics.  I'm not allowing this. 
WILLIAM Right -- let's talk about rent... 
SPIKE Let me help.  We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives. 
INT. BACKROOM OF THE BOOKSHOP - DAY 
The next day.  William is hard at work, doing the accounts in a dark small room with files in it.  Martin pops his head in. 
MARTIN I have to disturb you when you're cooking the books, but there's a delivery. 
WILLIAM Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself? 
MARTIN But it's not for the shop.  It's for you. 
WILLIAM Okay.  Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you? 
They head out, Martin behind him, incomprehensively rubbing his hands -- he's in a very good mood. 
INT. BOOKSHOP - DAY 
William enters -- and there stands Anna -- in a simple blue skirt and top. 
ANNA Hi. 
WILLIAM Hello. 
ANNA You disappeared. 
WILLIAM Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you. 
ANNA Well... how have you been? 
RITZ MAN No, sir. 
WILLIAM Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead? 
Man shakes his head. 
RITZ MAN No, sir. 
WILLIAM Right.  Right.  Fair enough.  Thanks. 
He turns despondent and takes two steps when the Ritz Man stops him in his tracks. 
RITZ MAN There was a Miss Pocahontas in room 126 -- but she checked out an hour ago.  I believe she's holding a press conference at The Savoy before flying to America. 
William is very grateful.  He kisses the Ritz Man.  Bernie's also gratuful.  He kisses him too. 
BERNIE We have lift off!! 
A Japanese guest assumes this is the way to behave and the Ritz Man gets kissed a third time. 
EXT. LONDON STREET - DAY 
The car speeds through London.  It gets totally stuck at a junction where no one will let them in. 
SPIKE Bugger this for a bunch of bananas. 
He gets out of the car and boldly stops the traffic coming in the opposite direction.  Our car shoots past him. 
SPIKE Go! 
They leave him behind.  Honey leans out the window and shouts... 
HONEY You're my hero. 
Spike waves wildly -- he loses concentration and is very nearly hit by a car. 
EXT. THE SAVOY - DAY 
They pull to a stop.  William leaps out. 
MAX Go! 
INT. THE SAVOY - DAY 
William rushes up to the main desk. 
WILLIAM Excuse me, where's the press conference? 
MAN AT SAVOY Are you an accredited member of the press? 
WILLIAM Yes... 
He flashes a card. 
MAN AT SAVOY That's a Blockbuster video membership card, sir. 
WILLIAM That's right... I work for their in- house magazine. (mimes quotation marks) 'Movies are our business.' 
MAN AT SAVOY I'm sorry, sir... 
Honey shoots into shot, pushing Bella's chair. 
BELLA He's with me. 
MAN AT SAVOY And you are? 
BELLA Writing an article about how London hotels treat people in wheelchairs. 
MAN AT SAVOY Of course, madam.  It's in the Lancaster Room.  I'm afraid you're very late. 
HONEY (to William) Run!

OVER BLACK: The sound of HELICOPTER ROTORS slicing through the air. STYLES (O.S.) Jesus, God. . . FADE IN ON: An ARMY HELICOPTER as it soars over the thick LOUISIANA BAYOU. Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below has been ripped to shreds. The kind of damage that can only be done by nature. SUPERIMPOSE:, FEBRUARY 2 - 0630 HOURS - 32 KILOMETERS NORTH OF FORT MCKINLEY, LOUISIANA INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE Sitting next to the PILOT is COLONEL WILLIAM STYLES. Mid- 40's, normally gruff, but completely cowed by the damage below. The PILOT, unfazed. PILOT Hurricane Beth, huh? Had    an ex-wife named Beth, this is pretty   much par for the course. This area    got the worst of it, I hope these   guys are all intact- STYLES That's enough, Lieutenant. SOMEONE'S P.O.V. - RUNNING through the underbrush - ducking branches, pushing through bushes, splashing through streams. LABORED BREATHING wheezes over the sound track. We're headed for a CLEARING... INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE The Pilot pushes his stick forward, descending to tree level. PILOT Coming up on the pick-up. EXT. CLEARING -- DAWN TWO MEN emerge from the underbrush at a run. The BIGGER MAN carrying the wounded SMALLER MAN over his shoulder. Both in ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy, and bloody. The Bigger Man lowers the Smaller Man to the ground and unshoulders his M-16. Face panicked. The sound of the HELICOPTER approaching... 
INT. ARMY HELICOPTER (FLYING) -- SUNRISE 
The unmistakable SOUND OF GUNFIRE from below. 
PILOT Holy shit, that's live fire! 
EXT. CLEARING -- SUNRISE 
As the Helicopter comes in for a landing, the Bigger Man kneels next to the Smaller Man, who bleeds from a bullet wound to the arm.  His face, pale, sweating. The Bigger Man wipes the Smaller Man's brow and speaks softly and seriously. 
BIGGER MAN Are you ready for this? 
The Smaller Man nods. 
INT. ROADHOUSE -- MORNING 
A full on shit-kicking dive.     Nearly empty, given the hour. A TELEVISION plays the morning    news over the bar.  Only two inhabitants - one a BARTENDER,    the other the lone CUSTOMER, smoking and picking at a plate    of criminally runny eggs. 
HARDY Tell the truth, Vic. You made these with a blender, right? He grins and we get our first good look at TOM HARDY - Three day stubble, dark rings around his eyes, but a with strong jaw and steady voice. Not your average barfly. Somebody who maybe used to be somebody. BARTENDER Don't like 'em, don't eat 'em, don't make no damn difference to me. HARDY You know that was like a quadruple negative? The Bartender takes the plate away from him. HARDY Can I at least have a drink? BARTENDER It's ten thirty in the morning. HARDY Yeah, if you've slept. BARTENDER You know the law - no liquor before noon. Could lose my license. HARDY Don't you mean "don't need no liquor license not taken away from me"? The Bartender smiles. BARTENDER Hurricane kept you up, too? HARDY Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going. He stops, his attention suddenly on the TV.    A NEWSCASTER: NEWSCASTER ...is expected to announce the grand jury indictments in the Guissepe Torres police corruption case as early as tomorrow afternoon. Speculations abound that up to ten former homicide detectives could be named in the proceedings- 
The Bartender turns the TV off hastily.   Embarrassed: BARTENDER Sorry. Hardy just looks away. The Bartender puts an empty glass down and fills it to the lip with bourbon. Hardy nods a "thank you" and reaches for the glass when the PAGER on his hip goes off. He checks the number. HARDY Bill Styles... BARTENDER Who? HARDY Old friend. Haven't talked to him in- 911. Can I use your phone? The Bartender hands him a cordless and Hardy dials. HARDY Hey, Bill, it's Tom. Long time no. . . whoa, whoa, slow down. Yeah... yeah, of course I'll come. An hour. He hangs up and hands the phone back to the Bartender. BARTENDER What was that? Hardy, obviously shaken by the call. HARDY I gotta go out to McKinley. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MORNING Establishing. A sprawling five square mile compound nestled in the Louisiana backwoods. Also damaged by the Hurricane. HELICOPTERS loaded with emergency supplies land and take off, REPAIR CREWS work feverishly on damaged buildings, all while CADET PLATOONS complete morning drills around them. This is still a boot camp after all. SUPERIMPOSE: 1130 HOURS - FORT MCKINLEY BASIC TRAINING CENTER EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- MAIN GATE -- MORNING Styles stands waiting nervously just beyond the CHECKPOINT with WARRANT OFFICER JULIA OSBORNE - early 30's, attractive, close cropped hair and icy eyes. In the middle of protesting. 
The six Cadets asleep, all except Kendall, who stares up at the patchwork ceiling. 
KENDALL (V.O.) It was the regular Tuesday night drill. He'd let us sleep for an hour and then wake us up, drag us out to the bayou, and work us all night, separate from the others. The door SLAMS OPEN, revealing West. 
WEST Get up, get up, get up! We're going on a little night hike, boys - muster in five on the south tarmac! 
He leaves as the Sectioners rise, groaning. 
PIKE Hurricane's due after midnight and we're still going out? 
MUELLER Toughens us up, Pike.    You don't like it, quit. 
Pike pulls on his pants and shoots him the finger. 
KENDALL Maybe we shouldn't go. 
KENDALL I'm- I'm sorry. . . 
Kendall, terrified. Shaking. A beat. Childs picks up the rifle from the ground and hands it back to him. 
CHILDS Come on, let's move. 
VARIOUS SHOTS -- Kendall and Childs, moving through the bayou, Childs taking out targets. It's raining harder now. 
KENDALL (V.O.) All I could think of was West, out there somewhere in the dark. Maybe watching the others, maybe watching me. And waiting to make his move. 
Childs speaks, and Kendall almost jumps out of his skin. 
CHILDS Christ, am I alone in this world? Shoot something- 
A SOUND from the left. Kendall panics, pivots, and FIRES... Into DARKNESS. No target, no West, no nothing. Kendall, really freaked out now. 
KENDALL How can you not know- Mueller comes at him, screaming: MUELLER Shut the fuck up, you fucking faggot, You just shut the FUCK UP- CHILDS HEY! Mueller stops, eyes crazed. Childs looks to the sky, which is becoming worse by the second. CHILDS We have to get out of this.    To find the cabin. He helps Kendall to his feet. KENDALL What about Pike? CHILDS Maybe he'll be there.    Either way, we have to go. Kendall nods, slowly.   The two start up the hill. MUELLER Shouldn't we- I mean, we shouldn't just leave him here. He points down to West's body.    Childs looks at it. CHILDS You can carry him if you want. He and Kendall continue on. Mueller lingers a moment longer and then turns, following them up the hill. EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT Kendall, Childs, and Mueller make their way through the bush. The WIND and RAIN have conspired into a FULL BLOWN HURRICANE. The three men are practically stumbling now, leaning in against it to stay on their feet. Kendall spies something through the maelstrom. It looks like WET WOOD. He points: KENDALL There! THE CABIN -- Wooden, one story, and large, it resembles a solidly built shack. It is being thrashed by the storm. 
The trio stumble towards the front door... INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT Obviously abandoned. Bare of any furniture save for two wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace. DUNBAR and NUNEZ shout in surprise as the three men practically collapse into the cabin. Dunbar runs to bolt the door against the elements as Nunez helps them up. NUNEZ What happened to you- MUELLER What happened to you? DUNBAR We finished the course and came here, Then heard an explosion- (to Mueller) Where's Pike? CHILDS We don't know. West is dead. Silence. Dunbar and Nunez stare at him.    Mueller jerks a hand towards Kendall and Childs. MUELLER They found him. Poor fucker was Practically blown in half- KENDALL Poor fucker my ass... MUELLER You better watch it, faggot, I'm not Sure you and Childs didn't do him- CHILDS What about you, wandering around Alone? At least we have an alibi- DUNBAR What do you mean, alone? MUELLER Pike and I got separated- KENDALL Yeah and he doesn't know when- MUELLER I remember now, it was before the Explosion- 
KENDALL Oh, you remember now- MUELLER I'm about two seconds away from seeing If fairies really can fly- NUNEZ What about Pike? Mueller stops, as the others turn towards the big man. Silence. They realize what the question means. DUNBAR He wouldn't kill anybody. . . MUELLER Oh, bullshit, he's a fucking convict. You know how much he hated West- DUNBAR I hated West, Childs hated West, everyone with a goddamn brain hated West but that doesn't mean we killed him! NUNEZ What if it wasn't one of us?    What if it was a local- KENDALL He was blown up by a phosphorous grenade, they don't exactly sell those at 7-11. MUELLER Look, here are the facts - Roberto was with Dunbar, Queen Kendall was with Childs, and Pike's the only one not here. He did it! The others nod, becoming convinced. CHILDS He is the only one unaccounted for. KENDALL Maybe he's dead too.    Maybe you killed Them both, Mueller- DUNBAR Shut up. (to Mueller) Let me see your grenades. MUELLER Why? 
DUNBAR We were each given three so whoever killed West will be missing one. Mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades. MUELLER See?   Three.     Now can we please- He stops. Hearing a SOUND outside.        Through the wind and rain, FOOTSTEPS on the porch. They all turn to the door.       Waiting... The DOOR SWINGS OPEN.. Pike.       Covered in BLOOD. PIKE Hey, guys. They stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks over to the empty FIREPLACE. Finally: DUNBAR Whose blood is that, Jay?       West's. PIKE Any kindling for afire? He looks around for kindling.       A beat. DUNBAR What do you mean, West's? PIKE I mean I killed him. (pause) Isn't that what we all wanted? INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY HARDY He admitted it. KENDALL Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back. Pike surrendered and volunteered to be tied up. So we roped him to a chair and tried to ride out the storm. OSBORNE Why would he just surrender? Kendall turns to her and smiles. KENDALL Because he had a plan. 
INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHT Pike, tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look for, food in the KITCHEN. Alone, Kendall walks past Pike: PIKE Hey, Kendall, talk to you for a sec? Kendall looks around - there seems no harm in it. PIKE You hated West as much as I did. I'm not saying what I did was right, but you can't tell me you're not glad the motherfucker's dead. Kendall says nothing. Pike looks around, makes sure no one is listening and then whispers: PIKE The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in Tomorrow and we're both fucked- KENOALL What are you talking about? PIKE A gay Senator's son who let his Sarge get fragged on a training exercise? The press'll crucify you and your father. His career will be over and it'll be your fault. But we do this different and you come out a hero. On Kendall, thinking about it.    A beat. KENOALL How? PIKE Mueller.    He's as bad as West and we both know   it. Now I can't do it, cause I'm   tied up, but we get the others to   go along- KENDALL Don't think I want to hear this- PIKE Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead - the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! (MORE) 
PIKE (CONT'D) We'll   move the bodies out to the creek   and say we came over the hill right   as they fragged West, all we gotta   do is tell the story right. Kendall stares at him.   Disgusted. KENDALL You're sick, Pike. He turns and walks away.   Pike watches him go. KENDALL (V.O.) Later on I.saw him talking to Dunbar. They had been close. I was in another room when it happened. INT. CABIN -- KITCHEN LAST NIGHT Kendall, looking through the empty cabinets for food when A GUNSHOT -- From the living room. As Kendall bolts towards the noise, the air is filled with the sounds of SCREAMING and SHOOTING! He pushes through the door... INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHT Kendall, coming through the door as we SLO-MO... Mueller, sprawled out on the floor, dead... Pike, tied to the chair, bullethole in his forehead... Nunez, wounded, stumbling out the front door into the hurricane... And a badly wounded Childs, pistol out, TURNING towards the SOUND OF THE DOOR and FIRING... Kendall's arm, HIT with a SLUG, and he starts to go down... FREEZE-FRAME -- On Kendall's form, falling. KENDALL (V.O.) I don't think he meant to do it. It was just reflex - he'd already been gutshot. I must have passed out cause next thing I knew... EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- DAWN The sounds of RUNNING  and HEAVY BREATHING. Kendall's eyes flutter open. He's on   Dunbar's back, being carried through the woods. The sound   of GUNFIRE and a TREE BRANCH SHATTERS next to them. Someone   is chasing them. Trying to kill them. Nunez. 
Dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes from behind and we can now hear ROTOR BLADES APPROACHING... EXT. CLEARING -- DAWN As Dunbar bursts into the sunlight, carrying Kendall. The entire thing dreamlike, what we saw at the opening, but from KENDALL'S VIEWPOINT -- the helicopter overhead, Nunez behind, Dunbar turning and shooting, NUNEZ GOING DOWN... INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY KENDALL And that's it. Hardy is silent.    Staring at him. OSBORNE Nunez was chasing Dunbar. KENDALL Because he'd shot Mueller. OSBORNE But you didn't see it, right? KENDALL Like I said, I was in the kitchen. When I came out, Mueller and Pike were dead, Nunez and Childs were hit and Dunbar was gone. HARDY Why did he come back for you? KENDALL I honestly don't know. Maybe to have someone to cover for him. And I wish I could, but there's no doubt in my mind he killed those men. Silence.   Kendall's got nothing more to say. HARDY Okay. I think that's it.     He rises and walks to the door. KENDALL Mr. Hardy? Hardy turns back. KENDALL What did Dunbar tell you? 
Hardy smiles and pushes out the door... 
OSBORNE I don't think that has anything to do with- 
HARDY That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me - murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people - it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy. 
Osborne struggles to put it into words. 
OSBORNE I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder. 
HARDY Everyone's capable of murder, Osborne. 
Osborne turns, making her case to Styles. 
OSBORNE Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies - he didn't see any crime committed. HARDY Well, I'm sure if he'd known this was all going to happen he'd have Tried harder to witness it for you- STYLES West's body isn't in the creek bed. They stop arguing, turning to look at him. STYLES We've already been over the terrain twice. Nothing. HARDY There was a hurricane, Bill, the wind probably moved it. STYLES Habeas Corpus - you have to have a body to have a crime. HARDY Okay, then let's widen the search 'to include the endzone in Giants Stadium and the trunk of my car- STYLES Without the body we have no physical proof. We need a confession. HARDY From Dunbar? I hate to break this to you, but I don't think he's gonna be all that psyched to put himself in for the death penalty. STYLES Nevertheless- HARDY Nevertheless what'? Kendall will testify and that'll be enough. STYLES Not for me. A beat. Almost accusingly: 
HARDY You mean not enough to save you. STYLES JAG gets here in three hours.   Try for the confession. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- DAY Dunbar looks up as Hardy and Osborne enter. HARDY (cheerfully) Hey, Ray! Just had a nice talk with your buddy. Kendall - seems you killed three people! DUNBAR That son of a bitch. HARDY That'd be my reaction too- DUNBAR He's lying. HARDY Well, why didn't you say so? We'll Just drop all your charges, then- DUNBAR I'm serious- Hardy leans across the table. HARDY Fuck "you're serious", Raymond, you got exactly zero truck with us; right now we'd take the word of a crackhead over yours, so if you've got something to say, say it. DUNBAR Did Kendall tell you about the PX? OSBORNE He said he worked there- DUNBAR No, did he tell you about it?   About the business Childs ran? OSBORNE What business? 
HARDY I'm talking about West! We had him, Bill, we were there. You're the fucking Base Commander, you knew what he did to Cadets and you let him go on the way he always he has- Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend- 
HARDY You knew what he was capable of and you just stood by. It was just a matter of time till somebody fragged his ass, and you know what? He deserved it. There's your confession. 
He pushes past a shocked Styles and walks out the door. 
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- DAY 
Hardy storms across the grass.   Osborne, still following. 
OSBORNE Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave- 
HARDY Watch me. 
OSBORNE You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him? Hardy whirls on her. HARDY West was a monster! Fifteen years ago, I was here, I was Section Eight, I was Pike. Fuck being the knife dummy- that thing he did, stripping Pike down, making him stand outside all night? He did that every year, he did that to me. Fifteen years ago, I wanted him dead, and now I'm supposed to care that somebody offed him? Sorry, no can do. I tried. OSBORNE You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal- HARDY Phenomenal at taking bribes, right? A beat.   Osborne shakes her head. OSBORNE I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone Said. I guess I was wrong- HARDY Oh, spare me the reverse psychology bullshit! This isn't my "great second chance", Osborne. Everyone thinks I'm a piece of shit cop who took money and nothing is going to change that. Nobody will ever know what happens here- OSBORNE But you will. Hardy stares at her. HARDY Why do you care? OSBORNE Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that. (pause) We can do this, Hardy. 
Mueller shows his three grenades to the others. 
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY 
OSBORNE At least you and Kendall agree on that. 
HARDY What happened next?     Dunbar shudders. 
DUNBAR Pike came back. 
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT 
Pike, staggering in through the door. The others get up from where they are sitting - it's been awhile since they arrived. Pike shouts at Mueller: 
PIKE What the fuck happened to you- 
The hurricane outside GROWING LOUDER as the Cabin ROCKS again. The sound of WOOD SNAPPING. Pike stares up at the roof. PIKE There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it- DUNBAR No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s- PIKE We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West - my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now. The cabin SHIFTS again.     Dunbar stares at him. PIKE Untie me. Dunbar doesn't move. PIKE Untie me, Ray. A long beat.   The two men stare at each other. And then Dunbar pulls his knife from his boot and leans down to cut Pike's bonds. PIKE Thank God. . . MUELLER (O.S.) What the fuck are you doing? Dunbar freezes.   Caught. He looks to the open kitchen door where Mueller stands. MUELLER Guys, get out here! The others enter the room. Dunbar, kneeling there, knife inches away from severing Pike's ropes. PIKE This place is going, Mueller.     We gotta move- 
MUELLER Shut the fuck up. (to the others) He was gonna cut him loose. The others stare at Dunbar. NUNEZ Why? PIKE Cause I didn't do it. Childs motions to Dunbar. CHILDS Get away from there. He's serious.    Dunbar moves away from Pike. MUELLER We all know what you did, Pike. I don't know what kind of nigger voodoo You been working in here, but- PIKE Where's your shirt, Mueller? MUELLER Used it to start the fire- PIKE Still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. Not a bad trick for a murderer- you said you burned yours? The others begin to look at Mueller with new eyes. MUELLER Was freezing from the hurricane- KENDALL So you took off your shirt? MUELLER To start a fire, goddammit! (pointing to Pike) What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work- The hurricane, reaching FEVER PITCH outside as WATER begins leaking in through the roof. 
PIKE Goddammit, Ray, we gotta get out of Here- MUELLER We're not going anywhere. PIKE TURNS TO MUELLER: PIKE Cadet Michael Mueller, I hereby place you under military arrest for the Murder of Sergeant Nathan West- MUELLER The fuck are you talking about- PIKE You are to be stripped of all weapons And placed under guard- MUELLER Bullshit- PIKE Until we return to base, and ballistics can match your weapon to the slugs in Sergeant West's body- MUELLER Shut up! Mueller pulls his SIDEARM and POINTS IT AT PIKE. KENDALL Mueller, what the fuck- DUNBAR Don't do this- Pike, EYES LOCKED with Mueller.    Continuing: PIKE A test will no doubt link you to the Killing- DUNBAR Put it down! MUELLER Tell him to shut up- PIKE -failure to comply with this arrest is a court martialable offense in and of itself- 
KENDALL Pike, please- PIKE Although that won't matter much when Coupled with the murder charge- MUELLER SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU FUCKING NIGGER- Pike leans forward. PIKE You stupid white trash motherfucker, I saw you do it- And Mueller FIRES. Pike's head SNAPS BACK. The gunshot, DEAFENING.    Then, for an eternity, SILENCE. Nobody moves.   Nobody breathes.   As if time has stopped. KENDALL Oh.. . my God... Mueller lowers his arm, the pistol clattering to the floor. His face, as shocked as the others. MUELLER He wouldn't... stop talking... He takes a step forward towards Pike.    A hole in the middle of the black man's forehead. DUNBAR (softly) So you killed him? MUELLER I. . . Almost mechanically, Dunbar begins to reach for his own gun... The unmistakable sound of a two rifles' magazines being RACKED simultaneously. Dunbar turns to see Childs and Nunez, their M-16's in hand. Levelled at him. CHILDS Get that hand away. Dunbar does.    Looks to Nunez. DUNBAR You too? 
CHILDS We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story. Mueller collapses on the ground.   Head in hands. MUELLER West was one thing, but this- CHILDS Shut up, Mueller. KENDALL You framed-him... CHILDS None of that matters now. We got two dead bodies and a story that explains them. You're either with us, or against us - which is it? Dunbar and Kendall, looking at each other. It's clear what the wrong answer will mean. A long beat, until KENDALL Okay- He is cut off as the WIND outside ROARS - the HURRICANE mounting to it's FULL FORCE - and the WINDOWS BLOW INWARDS, showering Childs, Mueller, and Nunez with glass! Dunbar's hand flies to his pistol, PULLING IT... Mueller, SCREAMING, trying to claw the glass from his EYES... Childs, seeing Dunbar move, PULLS THE TRIGGER. .. . And the cabin is filled with the THUNDER OF GUNFIRE as Kendall goes down, clutching his ARM... DUNBAR FIRES, hitting Childs directly in the chest... Childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of bullets PUNCHING INTO MUELLER who jerks like a marionette... Nunez, drawing a bead on Dunbar, about to shoot, when... A great CRESCENDO of WOOD SPLINTERING and SUPPORTS BUCKLING overtakes them and the CABIN'S ROOF COMES DOWN ON THEIR HEADS. EXT. DEMOLISHED CABIN -- FIRST LIGHT Hours later. The rain has lessened and the Hurricane has begun to lift as Dunbar pulls himself from the debris. Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left. 
Kendall.   Half conscious, his arm, bloody. Dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun begins to peak through the clouds overhead. EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- SUNRISE Dunbar, carrying Kendall towards the clearing when GUNFIRE comes from behind. He turns to look... Nunez. The only other survivor from the Cabin. A hundred yards back, rifle in hand, coming after them with a vengeance. Dunbar, sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a HELICOPTER OVERHEAD DUNBAR (V.O.) And then I killed the last of them. FLASHCUT TO - Nunez, chest blown open, going down... INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT DAY And we're back to the interrogation. Dunbar, stubbing out a cigarette and looking up at Hardy and Osborne. DUNBAR Can I have some coffee? Osborne blinks, like a trance has been broken. OSBORNE Yeah... yeah, sure. She goes over to the machine and pours a cup. HARDY You shot Childs and Nunez. DUNBAR They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession. HARDY You saved Kendall's life- DUNBAR But not Pike's. Osborne hands him the coffee. OSBORNE Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place? 
DUNBAR Would you have believed me? Their faces say "no".   Osborne spreads a MAP out on the table. OSBORNE Where's the cabin? DUNBAR Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away. HARDY Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story- DUNBAR Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this - I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die. EXT. FOR MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY Hardy and Osborne, walking and talking. OSBORNE Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or ho hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike. HARDY And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness. OSBORNE Dunbar. HARDY Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events. 
OSBORNE They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent. HARDY And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world. OSBORNE So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the Cover story- HARDY Kendall maybe would have agreed, but The hurricane buttfucks the cabin- OSBORNE Buttfucks the cabin? HARDY And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending. OSBORNE So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber? HARDY That bugs you too? OSBORNE Little bit. HARDY Let's go talk to Bill... INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- DAY Hardy and Osborne stand in front of an agitated Styles. He tries to take a hit off his asthma inhaler and gets nothing. Frustrated, he tosses it away. STYLES Fucking asthma... This whole thing's driving it nuts. A beat. HARDY What I said before- 
KENDALL Not much time to solve the crime. Tell me, detective, how did it feel taking blood money from Guissepe Torres? Did it weigh on your conscience or did you just not think about it? 
HARDY You tried to pin three stone murders on Dunbar- 
KENDALL How many murders did you cover up? One? Five? Maybe an even ten. 
HARDY (to Osborne) Can I go to jail for punching a guy who's been shot? 
Kendall begins coughing. 
KENDALL I think they're giving me the wrong medicine. This isn't a very good Hospital, you know- 
Hardy sighs and goes to the sink to get him some water. 
KENDALL Epileptic attacks are murder on your system. Rattle your internal organs like a paint mixer. HARDY My heart weeps. He returns with a GLASS OF WATER and hands it to Kendall. OSBORNE Pike never confessed. KENDALL No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong. HARDY Is it the truth? KENDALL There's that word again. (smiling) As I told you, I wasn't in the room when everyone started shooting. OSBORNE Dunbar says you were. KENDALL Then he's mistaken. You know, I really don't think my father would approve of this line of questioning- HARDY Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life- KENDALL So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun- HARDY Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door. 
KENDALL What? 
HARDY That's a fantastic idea- 
OSBORNE See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission- 
KENDALL (beginning to panic) It won't work- 
OSBORNE It will and you know why? (MORE) 
OSBORNE Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off! She finishes, breathing hard. Kendall, totally cowed. Hardy, trying to suppress a smile. Osborne rises for the door. OSBORNE Enjoy your flight to Washington- KENDALL Wait- OSBORNE What. Silence.   Kendall takes a deep breath. KENDALL Dunbar's telling the truth. OSBORNE Wrong answer- KENDALL We did get our stories straight, but not because we killed anyone. (pause) It was because I threatened him. HARDY Why? KENDALL Because of what I saw. (pause) Who really killed West. Osborne holds up the microrecorder and starts the tape again. OSBORNE Who killed Sergeant West? Kendall stares at the recorder.   A long pause. OSBORNE Who, Levi- KENDALL Childs. 
HARDY How do you know? KENDALL Because I was standing next to him. He pauses, taking a shaky sip of water. KENDALL I was in on the PX thing. He and Mueller and me, we were making thousands. West found out. Childs said we were just gonna scare him - Use my Dad's clout. I had this whole speech prepared about how if he ratted us, his career was over. We met him in the creek bed but before I said anything... EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT West stands in front of Childs and Kendall, facing them. Kendall opens his mouth to speak, but Childs steps forward and raises his rifle, FIRING... INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY KENDALL I swear, I didn't know he was gonna do it. After, he told me we were gonna pin it on Pike, one of our biggest customers. INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT As they TIE PIKE to the, chair. KENDALL (V.O.) Nobody'd believe the word of a black junkie ex-con against ours. Childs gives Kendall a look that says "Stay quiet". KENDALL (V.O.) He told me I'd better keep quiet, or I'd end up the same as West. Pan over to Dunbar, who binds his friend, sadly. KENDALL (V.O.) Dunbar didn't know anything about any of it. Everything he told you was true, except after... 
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT Dunbar pulls Kendall from the cabin's wreckage. As Kendall begins to talk to him, Dunbar's eyes widen in shock. .. KENDALL (V.O.) I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished. INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY KENDALL I scared Dunbar into silence.  He's been trying to cover for me the whole time. We got here, you came to  see me... I didn't know if I could trust him with that kind of secret- OSBORNE So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike. Kendall nods.   Crying a little. HARDY Little advice, Levi, next time you frame a guy, pick someone who can't defend themselves. Kendall says nothing. OSBORNE What happened with Nunez? KENDALL He came after us. And I told Dunbar he had to kill him... EXT. CLEARING -- EARLIER THAT MORNING The helicopter, hovering overhead. Dunbar, carrying Kendall, spinning his rifle to face Nunez, sixty yards away. Dunbar hesitates before firing, not wanting to... KENDALL Do it! Dunbar's rifle ERUPTS... INT. KENDALL'S HOSPITAL ROOM -- PRESENT DAY KENDALL And he did. 
OSBORNE He's an epileptic! 
The Nurse runs to the bed, pushing Hardy aside. As more MEDICAL PERSONNEL runs into the room, they usher Hardy and Osborne to the door. 
DOCTOR You're going to have to wait outside- 
OSBORNE He's a witness! 
DOCTOR It doesn't matter, outside- 
KENDALL F-F-F-F-F-F-Fuh- 
Osborne tries to move to him, but the Doctor blocks her path. 
OSBORNE He's trying to say something- 
OSBORNE We got maybe three minutes till they break it down. 
HARDY Right back where we started. 
DUNBAR You want to talk about baseball now? 
Hardy practically throws Dunbar into a chair. 
HARDY No more games, right, Pike?    It was you who West singled out... 
FLASHCUT TO - WEST on the parade grounds, now strangling DUNBAR on the first day... 
HARDY You who got hooked by Mueller's morphine... 
FLASHCUT TO - Now DUNBAR in the showers as MUELLER hands him a syringe... 
Dunbar chuckles at the bluff. 
DUNBAR Ohhhh, I don't think so... 
OSBORNE How do you know that? 
DUNBAR Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus - no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives ... you have nothing. 
Hardy, knowing he's right. In a flash he reaches down PULLS OSBORNE'S GUN and grabs Dunbar, SLAMMING him up against the wall, pressing the weapon TO HIS TEMPLE! 
HARDY Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun- 
DUNBAR (terrified) Jesus! 
OSBORNE Hardy, what are you doing- 
The JAG Lawyer glowers as the M.P.'s stand down.   Dunbar tries to pull himself together. To Hardy: DUNBAR You're right. I was the one he singled out. Beat me morning, noon, and night, ran me ragged. When Mueller found me, I was gone. He gave me a little taste... INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO Mueller showing the syringe to the naked Dunbar.   Dunbar's voice over speaks in unison with Mueller: MUELLER AND DUNBAR (V.O.) I got a friend with an in at the PX, can hook you up... INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING DUNBAR What I didn't know, was his friend was West. He ran the whole thing. STYLES You're lying, son. DUNBAR You think it's easy to have all that morphine just disappear without a higher up authorizing it? Check the requisition orders, I'll lay money it's his signature on them. INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO Dunbar, alone, sleeve rolled up, arm tied off: Sliding the needle into his vein... DUNBAR (V.O.) That was his game, see? Ride the cadets so hard they'd need something to stay on their feet. Then he'd send Mueller or Kendall to them, waving around their magic needle promising to make it all go away. He hits the plunger, injecting.   His face goes tranquil. INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING DUNBAR It wasn't a new thing either.   He'd been doing this for years. (MORE) 
DUNBAR Every nine weeks, a new class of cadets, new potential customers. The amount of money involved over that period of time... this was some high stakes shit. He takes a deep breath, looking at them. DUNBAR Dunbar moved his through the kitchen. I worked in the motor pool and hooked all the mechanics. By the time the hurricane hit, we were all in. Some using, some pushing, some both. But then something happened. West heard one of us was about to talk, to blow his whole operation. He figured he'd made enough money, had enough of the army, maybe it was time to disappear. But first he was gonna teach us one last thing. INT. SECTION EIGHT BARRACKS -- LAST NIGHT West, entering the,barracks, shouting the cadets awake. DUNBAR (V.O.) The Tuesday Night drill was the perfect cover. The hurricane made it even better. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- TARMAC -- LAST NIGHT The cadets, climbing aboard the chopper. DUNBAR (V.O.) He put us on the chopper and flew us to his cabin. And then he told us. INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT The six men stand in rigid formation, eyes on West. WEST Gentlemen! It has come to my attention that there is a traitor in our midst. Someone who was going to break the code of fraternal brotherhood that I have endeavored to create in all of you. Perhaps that failure is mine. But we take care of our own. And this traitor must be made to pay. He walks down the line of the six men, eyeing each of them. Finally stopping at one. Putting a hand on his shoulder. 
Nunez. WEST Run. NUNEZ Sir, I wasn't- WEST I know you were. Cadet  Mueller found the letter you'd written to the Colonel in your locker.  You were going to betray us all.  Now, run. He points to the door. The hurricane, RAGING outside.   Nunez looks to the others, then the door, and understands. He takes off running out the door.       Gone. West walks over to a table covered with a tarp. Pulls the cloth aside to reveal M-16's, PISTOLS, and GRENADES. WEST Now we'll see whose training's paid off the most. You are to hunt Cadet Nunez down and bring his body back to me. If you fail and he escapes, we all go down together. The remaining five cadets, understanding there is no place for friendship or kindness here. This is life and death. They walk to the table and gear up. EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT Lightning, thunder, and rain as Nunez runs unarmed through the thick brush. SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM - The other five fan out, rifles up, following his trail, ready to kill. DUNBAR (V.O.) It was insanity. We were hunting a man down to kill him. ON MUELLER Making his way down embankment, M-l6 out, ready for anything. From behind him, MOVEMENT... DUNBAR (V.O.) He got Mueller first. Nunez TACKLES HIM at full speed, feet SLIPPING on the wet hill, and the two TUMBLE head first into a GULLY. Punching, kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man. 
Nunez, CHOKING Mueller as he strains to reach his gun... MUELLER Roberto... With a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK.        Mueller lies still. DUNBAR (V.O.) He took his gun. Used it on Childs. Nunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs fires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's rifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks. DUNBAR (V.O.) I can't imagine what it was like. Having your friends try to kill you... Nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard.          In agony over what he's just had to do. DUNBAR (V.O.) But you do what you have to survive. Closing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood from his hands and climbs out of the gully. ELSEWHERE PIKE, creeping through the foliage. Trying to listen for sounds of movement through the storm. His eyes narrow as he hears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE... The bullet hits his forehead dead center.        He crumples. PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away. Lowering his rifle.      He climbs down. DUNBAR (V.O.) Kendall and I found Dunbar a couple minutes later. TIME CUT TO: Dunbar and Kendall come upon Pike's fallen form. They gaze down at the uniform emblazoned with the name "DUNBAR". DUNBAR (V.O.) It came to me in a split second. Change clothes, change identities. If James Pike gets discharged he goes right back to jail. But if I was Dunbar, I could walk away from all this with a new life. But then... As he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT. 
KENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm. Dunbar raises his rifle to find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him. YELLING OVER THE HURRICANE: NUNEZ Put it down! A Mexican stand-off.   The rain continues to fall. DUNBAR I just want to go! Nunez shakes his head. NUNEZ You were gonna kill me, Pike!    Thought you were my friend! Dunbar, torn. He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't surrender either. DUNBAR I have to get Kendall to a hospital! NUNEZ He was gonna kill me too! Silence.   The two men still facing each other. NUNEZ {CONT'D) I snapped Mueller's neck! He was my best friend and I had to snap his neck because he was gonna shoot me for drugs! For West! DUNBAR We don't have to do this! You go that way, I'll go this way! Nunez laughs. NUNEZ You'll shoot me in the back! DUNBAR You killed three people!    Isn't that enough for one night? More silence.   Neither moves.    The sky above, a maelstrom. DUNBAR I don't want to die out here, Roberto! Do you? Nunez, staring at him.     Deciding. 
NUNEZ If you even twitch... Dunbar nods. Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him. And then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of Nunez... West. Staring down at him from behind some brush.       Watching. Nunez, slowly backing away. He pauses as his foot catches on a fallen branch. Looks away from Dunbar for a split second to step over it... West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on. . . " DUNBAR Forgive me. .. And Dunbar FIRES. Nunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the gunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in agony. West walks down. WEST Congratulations, Cadet Pike.      You get the gold star. Dunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain. DUN BAR Fuck you. West smiles.   Tilts his head to Kendall. WEST You'd best get him out of here. Don't worry about the bodies, they'll be taken care of. Dunbar doesn't move. WEST This is where we part ways, Cadet. You tell them I died out here, or I'll come back for you. Tell them one of the others did me. Mueller, Childs, I don't care who. You and Kendall, you tell them a story. (smiling) You can tell a story, can't you? Dunbar doesn't reply.   West laughs and flips him a salute. 
WEST Dismissed. 
And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez.   Giving Dunbar a clear shot at his back. 
HARDY Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital - you're the only other person who visited Kendall. 
STYLES Wanted to see if he was okay- 
HARDY You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike. 
STYLES I'm not even going to dignify that- 
HARDY No!  You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill?  You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it- 
STYLES You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you. HARDY Not for long. He walks towards the desk. HARDY No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough. STYLES You're crazy- HARDY You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen. STYLES For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about- HARDY (squinting) Get your hands away from the desk! In the darkness we see Styles MOVE SUDDENLY... HARDY Osborne, gun! Hardy DIVES to the floor - Osborne in the doorway, PISTOL raised, FIRES TWO SHOTS! Muzzle flare lighting the room for a split second as Styles is BLOWN BACK against the wall! Hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the LIGHT. Styles lies slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest. Dead. Osborne lowers her weapon, shaking. Hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open. Inside it sits an IVORY HANDLED PISTOL. Fully loaded, safety off. It's presence tells them everything they need to know. 
OSBORNE It's West's, isn't it? Hardy nods and then turns to look down at Styles' body. HARDY Now it's over. EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- NIGHT The aftermath. Flashing blue and red lights from parked Military Police vehicles illuminate the grounds as M.P. 'S string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the building, securing the site for investigation. Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar. Standing by his GTO, watching as several M.P.'s finish questioning Osborne. When she's done she spies Hardy and walks over to him. OSBORNE What are you doing out here? HARDY Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do? OSBORNE Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened. HARDY Think it'll work? OSBORNE Nah. HARDY Want company? Osborne smiles. OSBORNE A word of advice about women - that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them. HARDY I should probably write that down. OSBORNE Yeah. . Hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her. OSBORNE Your phone number? 
HARDY In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you. A beat. OSBORNE He was your friend. HARDY Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks. She nods.   An awkward moment.      Finally: HARDY I'll see you. He turns away.   Walking towards his car. OSBORNE Hey, Hardy! He turns back. She walks up and holds something out to him. A ten dollar bill. OSBORNE I owe you this. He looks down at the money. HARDY You saved my life tonight. Keep it. (pause) Actually, don't keep it, I need the money. He takes the bill and Osborne laughs. He climbs into his car and starts it. Grinning at her through the open window. HARDY You're one of the good ones, Osborne. Don't sweat the details. He puts the GTO in gear and drives off. She watches him go, then looks down at his card. Smiling. Maybe she will call. INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT A bottle of Scotch at her side, Osborne slips a tape marked "BASIC TRAINING INTRO - SGT. N. WEST" into her VCR. Settles back to watch it. West's face fills the screen. WEST Welcome, Cadets. The art of warfare is simple and complex. Simple in its goal, complex in its execution. 
HARDY (V.O.) When you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy.. . 
ON STYLES' FACE - Watching this through the windscreen. 
STYLES (V.O.) The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up. 
RACK FOCUS TO - Hardy, concealed in the woods, FIRING at Dunbar and Kendall's feet to simulate Nunez shooting at them. Dunbar, shooting towards where Nunez's body lies. Making it look like he just killed Nunez. 
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- THIS MORNING 
Hardy arriving at the Fort, EMBRACING STYLES. 
HARDY And for that to work, you have to have a witness... 
PAN OVER to OSBORNE, watching.

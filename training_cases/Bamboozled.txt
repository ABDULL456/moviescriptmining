Bamboozled 
by 
Spike Lee 
BLACK SCREEN 
We HEAR the voice of MALCOLM X. 
MALCOLM X (V.O.) You've been hoodwinked.  You've been had.  You've been took. You've been led astray, run amok. You've been bamboozled. 
His followers ROAR. 
CUT TO TITLE: 
"BAMBOOZLED" 
CUT TO CRAWL: 
WHITE LETTERS ON BLACK 
WE HEAR the VOICE of PIERRE DELACROIX. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) Satire.  1a.  A literary work in which human vice or folly is ridiculed or attacked scornfully. B.  The branch of literature that composes such work.  2.  Irony, derision or caustic wit used to attack or expose folly, vice or stupidity. 
INT. APARTMENT - MORNING 
WE are in the living quarters of PIERRE DELACROIX.  The windows overlook the Brooklyn Promenade and the majestic lower Manhattan skyline. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) Bonjour, my name is Pierre Delacroix. I'm a television writer, also a showrunner, a creative person. 
We see a tall figure move in and around the space. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) I'm one of those people responsible for what you view on your idiot box. 
CLOSE ON 
Monogrammed cuff sleeve - the initials P.D. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) The problem is not enough of you have been watching. 
CLOSE ON 
Monogrammed shirt pocket - the initials P.D. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) With the onslaught of the internet, video and interactive games, nine hundred channels to choose from and whatnot, our valued audience has dramatically eroded. 
CLOSE ON 
Razor cuts a path through a white foam on a black face. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) To put it in much more simple terms... 
Delacroix YELLS. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) Like rats fleeing a sinking ship. 
CLOSE ON 
The handsome face of Pierre Delacroix. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) People tuning out by the millions. 
Delacroix turns to the CAMERA and addresses US. 
DELACROIX (CONT'D) Which is not good. 
EXT. TENEMENT - LOWER EAST SIDE - MORNING 
The tenement building is boarded up, condemned, bombed out, but a home, a shelter nonetheless. 
INT. TENEMENT - MORNING 
People to our surprise live in here.  It is a commune.  The homeless, people who have been left out, forgot about, written off, and don't matter.  The fringes of society. 
CHEEBA, a skinny Puerto Rican male, tries to wake a slumbering body under a mass of old newspapers. 
CHEEBA Yo, let's get to it.  You don't dance, we don't eat.  Simple as that. 
The mass begins to move. 
CHEEBA (CONT'D) That's right.  We slow.  We blow. We snooze.  We lose. 
INT. CNS TOWER - MORNING 
MANRAY, a young African-American dread-lock male, and Cheeba are getting set up in front of the entrance to the CONTINENTAL NETWORK SYSTEM building.  CNS is one of the fledgling, upstart new networks, trying to battle with ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX, WB, and UPN. 
ANGLE ON 
Entrance.  Cheeba is putting the portable floor down on the sidewalk.  Manray sits on the curb, taking the sneakers off and putting on his tap shoes; bottle caps are on the soles of the shoes instead of real taps. 
CHEEBA Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. I know everybody is in a hurry to work, ready to begin another day in this rat race.  But don't sleep us. I'm Cheeba and I introduce to you the world renown MANRAY, the man with the educated feet. 
Manray takes a small bow.  A few, not many, people have stopped to look. 
CHEEBA (CONT'D) As we continue our world wind tour, we would like to give you a little somethin', somethin' before you go off to make that money.  I give you Manray. 
CLOSE ON 
Manray, who starts to do his thing, and when he starts doing his thing attention must be paid. 
ANGLE ON 
CLOSE ON 
Dunwitty. 
DUNWITTY (CONT'D) I do not like to be the laughing stock of the broadcast industry.  I have pride and people, you better start getting some too.  These numbers have to go up. 
Dunwitty turns on the lights.  JOAN, one of the writers, raises her hand. 
DUNWITTY (CONT'D) Question? 
JOAN So what do you want us to do? 
DUNWITTY What I want everyone to do is write some material that is FUNNY.  The junk you've been writing is about as funny as a dead baby.  It's not funny, it's not new.  It's not sexy. It, it, it... 
CLOSE ON 
Fish. 
FISH Sucks. 
ANGLE ON 
Conference room. 
DUNWITTY SUCKS.  Thank you, Fish.  This meeting is over but I want everyone to seriously think about what I said and how you can deliver. 
People scurry out. 
DUNWITTY (CONT'D) Monsieur Delacroix, in my office now. 
INT. HALLWAY - MORNING 
The writers, beat down, come out of the conference room and move past SLOAN HOPKINS, a highly attractive African- American "sistuh." 
Delacroix sees Sloan and holds her arm as they walk.  He talks under his breath. 
SLOAN How was it? 
DELACROIX Why didn't you tell me about this staff meeting? 
SLOAN Nobody told me anything. 
DELACROIX What good are you if you don't tell me stuff like this? 
SLOAN It wasn't my fault.  If I would have known, I would have known. 
INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Delacroix enters his corner office, which has huge action photos of ALI, JORDAN, GRIFFEY, TYSON, AARON and JABBAR on his walls, it is also decorated with African art throughout. 
ANGLE ON 
Office.  Dunwitty looks at the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking mid-town Manhattan. 
DUNWITTY Do you know what C.P. Time is? 
DELACROIX C.P. Time is Colored People's Time. The stereotypical belief that Negroes are always late.  That Negroes have no sense of time - time except when it comes to music or dance. 
They both laugh. 
DUNWITTY Let's sit down over there. 
Dunwitty and Delacroix sit on the sofa. 
DUNWITTY (CONT'D) I'm sorry about my blowup but I have to have a whipping boy every meeting. 
DELACROIX I understand.  But again, in all honesty I was not informed. 
DUNWITTY Forget it.  I believe you're my most creative person I've got on staff.  You're hip.  You know what's happening.  I got some corny white boys and girls writing for me. 
Delacroix doesn't join him in his laughter because he doesn't know how to take that comment or where Dunwitty is headed with it. 
DUNWITTY (CONT'D) I understand Black culture.  I grew up around black people all my life. If the truth be told I probably know "niggers" better than you, Monsieur Delacroix.  Please don't get offended by my use of the quote-unquote N word.  I got a black wife and three bi-racial children, so I feel I have a right to use that word.  I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right.  Nigger is just a word.  If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I. 
DELACROIX I would prefer you not use that word in my presence. 
DUNWITTY NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER.  NIGGER. 
Delacroix pounces on top of Dunwitty like a cat on a mouse and gives him a quick BROOKLYN BEAT DOWN. 
DELACROIX Say it again.  C'mon, say it again. 
CLOSE ON 
Dunwitty.  He's a bloody pulp. 
CLOSE ON 
Delacroix. 
He straightens his tie. 
DELACROIX (CONT'D) Who's a nigger now? 
POW.  This is a fantasy in Delacroix's mind.  We go BACK TO REALITY.  Everything's how we left it. 
DUNWITTY The material you've been creating is too white bread.  White people with black faces.  The Huxtable's, Cosby, revolutionary.  But that's dead.  We can't go down that road again. 
DELACROIX I don't agree.  The Negro middle class does exist, and it's rich material for a dramatic series or sitcom. 
DUNWITTY I'm telling you it's not. 
He goes to his desk, picks up Delacroix's scripts and starts throwing them one by one against the window. 
Manray screws out the bare light bulb which is the sole source of illumination and lays down onto his mattress on the floor. 
INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT 
Sloan closes her laptop and jumps into her bed. 
INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT 
Delacroix is already in the bed, the lights are out. 
CLOSE ON 
Delacroix, who's wide awake. 
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Manray and Cheeba are both sound asleep. 
CLOSE ON 
Cheeba, he has a sheet pulled over his head. 
CLOSE ON 
Manray, who's sawing logs, snoring loudly. 
OFF-SCREEN, WE HEAR A RUCKUS, A BIG COMMOTION.  VOICES yelling.  Police sirens, cars and trucks. 
ANGLE ON 
Apartment.  Cheeba and Manray run to the window and look out. 
THEIR POV 
The street is filled with police cars, vans and wagons. Helicopters hover overhead with their searchlights on the building. 
CHEEBA Oh snap!  It's a raid! 
Cheeba and Manray jump into their cloths. 
EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Cops in riot gear storm into the tenement.  A police chief barks over a speaker system. 
POLICE CHIEF Please evacuate this building.  All of you are illegal residents of this condemned building.  Please leave immediately, by order of the Mayor of New York City, Rudolph Giuliani. 
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
Stairwell.  It's bedlam.  The hundreds of SQUATTERS who have been living here all making a bad dash trying to flee the NYPD as they "bumrush the show." 
ANGLE ON 
Floor.  Cheeba and Manray try to push against the crowd. 
CHEEBA Not this way.  Out through the fire escape. 
The COPS are running up the staircase.  People try to escape with as many of their belongings that they can hold. 
MANRAY My tap shoes. 
INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT 
DELACROIX EUREKA!! 
He jumps out of bed. 
INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT 
SLOAN Oh my God!!! 
She too jumps out of bed. 
EXT. TENEMENT BUILDING 
It is a MADHOUSE, BEDLAM.  It's PANDEMONIUM.  The Squatters are being seized as soon as they come out of the tenement. Searchlights go back and forth, as the cops make their arrests and fill the "Paddy" wagons. 
ANGLE ON 
Street.  The Squatters are like ROACHES in a dark kitchen at night, scrambling as the lights turn on.  Do you remember those old "RAID" commercials.  "Let's scram, IT'S RAID!!!" 
INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The phone rings. 
CUT TO SPLIT SCREEN 
CU OF DELACROIX AND SLOAN 
Delacroix picks it up.  They yell in unison. 
DELACROIX Manray! 
SLOAN Manray! 
DELACROIX How did you know? 
SLOAN It hit me like a ton of bricks. 
DELACROIX How can this be?  You and me at the same time, the exact same thought. It's scary. 
SLOAN The idea was out there in the universe.  Now what? 
INT. TENEMENT BUILDING - NIGHT 
SECURITY GUARD #2 De La Soul ain't here either. Let's go.  Out.  Off the premises. 
Manray turns around and sees Sloan. 
MANRAY Sloan!  She knows us. 
The security guard stops. 
SLOAN It's alright.  They are associates of Mr. Delacroix. 
SECURITY GUARD #1 Sorry, Ms. Hopkins.  They both walked in off the street without an appointment. 
SECURITY GUARD #2 Do you need an escort? 
SLOAN That won't be needed. 
INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - DAY 
He sits in front of his TV and watches a tape of the old "Amos 'n' Andy" show.  Sloan leads Manray and Cheeba in. 
DELACROIX Eureka!  Where've you been? 
He hugs them both. 
DELACROIX (CONT'D) Sloan and I have been looking all over for you. 
CHEEBA You'd take no offense if we called you DeLa for short? 
DELACROIX No offense. 
CHEEBA Manray needs a job. 
Delacroix smiles at Sloan. 
MANRAY We got evicted from our home. We've both been on the streets for the last week. 
CHEEBA We was coming to see you. 
MANRAY If it's not too much trouble could you order us some food? 
CHEEBA We're starving. 
DELACROIX I apologize.  What would you like to eat?  Anything you want. 
TIME CUT 
INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - DAY 
A feast of McDonald's is taking place.  Cheeba and Manray are stuffing Big Macs, Fish Deluxes and large french fries into their mouths.  They were famished. 
DELACROIX I have this concept for a TV pilot. There's no guarantee it will get made but regardless, you'll still make some money. 
CHEEBA How much? 
DELACROIX First things first.  I have to know if Manray is up for this. 
MANRAY What do I have to do? 
DELACROIX Some tap dancing, some singing. 
MANRAY Where do I sign? 
CHEEBA What kind of show is this gonna be? 
DELACROIX Different. 
MANRAY How different? 
DELACROIX Trust me.  Of course I still have to pitch it to my boss, but we'll have an answer one way or the other. 
MANRAY DeLa, I'm aboard.  As long as I get to hoof and get paid too!!! 
DELACROIX That's right.  Money turns the wheel. 
CHEEBA What about in the mean time?  Not the in between time? 
DELACROIX You'll both get an advance and you can stay with me. 
MANRAY Bet. 
DELACROIX I would like to change your name. 
MANRAY To what? 
DELACROIX You're now Mantan. 
MANRAY Mantan?  I don't even care as long as I'm dancing.  Which reminds me, I need some new kicks. 
EXT. BROADWAY - DAY 
Manray holds two Capezio shopping bags of shoes as he walks next to Sloan. 
MANRAY I never had a really real pair before. 
SLOAN You've never had any formal training, either? 
MANRAY Not a class, not a thing, just picked stuff up by myself. 
SLOAN I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while. 
MANRAY You sing and dance? 
SLOAN A little.  I just graduated from NYU film school.  Cinema studies. 
INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING 
One by one, the team enters the office and sits down on the sofa. 
DUNWITTY Delacroix, I'm glad you got your mind right. 
DELACROIX It's right and tight.  Good morning, let me introduce you to everybody. You know my assistant, Sloan. 
SLOAN Hello. 
DELACROIX This is Cheeba. 
CHEEBA Nice to meet you. 
DELACROIX And this is Manray. 
MANRAY How do you do? 
DUNWITTY Good.  I like the names.  Very theatrical. 
DELACROIX We're all happy to be here and I'm going to paint a picture for you. 
DUNWITTY I'm wid it. 
DELACROIX I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right.  In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial.  I have never really dug deep.  Not anymore.  As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way.  Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder.  If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing. 
DUNWITTY Go on.  Good so far. 
DELACROIX I know you're familiar with minstrel shows.  They came about at the turn of the 19th century.  It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air.  Carol Burnett? HeeHaw? 
DUNWITTY Word!!! 
DELACROIX So let's take this great form, this very American tradition of entertainment into the 21st century, into the new millennium. 
DUNWITTY The name of the show? 
DELACROIX It is called: MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW. 
DUNWITTY I'm lovin' it.  You know how I know? Because I'm getting a boner, my Johnson is hard, no disrespect my sister. 
Dunwitty starts walking around his office, pumping his first. 
DUNWITTY (CONT'D) I'm feelin' dis'! 
DELACROIX It will take a lot of courage and backbone on the part of the CNS to get this on the air.  In fact, I would understand fully if the subject matter is deemed too risque, too controversial. 
DUNWITTY Don't worry about that, that's my department.  Now who do we cast? We need a star.  Can Whoopi sing or dance? 
DELACROIX I don't know if Whoopi is the way to go. 
DUNWITTY Are these our two stars, sitting here in front of my nose?  Which one is Mantan again? 
MANTAN That's me. 
DELACROIX And Cheeba is Sleep 'n' Eat. 
CLOSE ON 
Cheeba.  A look of surprise is on his face.  Complete, utter surprise. 
DUNWITTY That's a great handle. 
DELACROIX Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  Two real coons.  I know we're way out there but it's satire. 
DUNWITTY I want you take it there.  All the way to the edge and back. 
Sloan looks at Delacroix with concern. 
DELACROIX Every week we follow the trials and tribulations of two real coons - Mantan and Sleep 'n Eat.  The Dusky Duo. 
DUNWITTY What are there character traits? 
DELACROIX Ignorant, dullwitted, lazy, and unlucky. 
DUNWITTY Exactly! 
DELACROIX Mantan is an uneducated Negro who always by some stroke of unbelievable stupidity makes his best laid plans go haywire. 
DUNWITTY And Sleep 'n Eat is his comical sidekick? 
DELACROIX Yep, you guessed it. 
DUNWITTY This could be bigger than "Amos and Andy." 
DELACROIX Protest finally forced "Amos and Andy" off the air.  Could stop us from ever getting on. 
DUNWITTY Let'em try.  I will kill to make this happen. 
Delacroix looks at Sloan. 
DELACROIX Negroes would be in an uproar. 
DUNWITTY So what.  We would just give the NAACP a donation that would be the end of that.  No such thing as bad publicity.  So what.  Earlier you said singing and dancing. 
DELACROIX Mantan right here is a gifted hoofer.  He has educated feet. 
DUNWITTY Who are the other characters? 
DELACROIX Do we have characters?  How about Honeycutt, Snowflake, Rastus, Nigger, Jim, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and how could we forget Aunt Jemima. 
Dunwitty is dying with laughter.  He's the only one. 
DUNWITTY We gonna hit 'em wid da BOMB DICKEY on dis' one.  What's the setting? 
Everyone raises their glasses.  CLINK! 
SLOAN Excuse me. 
Sloan gets up from the table and takes after Delacroix. 
ANGLE ON 
Steps. Sloan catches up with Delacroix at the rest room area. 
SLOAN (CONT'D) Wait here. 
She goes to the ladies' cubicle. 
CLOSE ON 
Delacroix.  He leans against the wall. 
ANGLE ON 
Bathroom door.  Sloan comes out, grabs him inside. 
INT. LADIES' ROOM - NIGHT 
Sloan locks the door. 
SLOAN What is your problem? 
DELACROIX My problem is MANTAN THE NEW MILLENIUM MINSTREL SHOW. 
SLOAN Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made? 
DELACROIX It was the principle.  Dunwitty had to be enlightened.  I was making a point.  I take pride in my work. Plus, I already told you I wasn't gonna walk away from my money. 
SLOAN Fuck da money.  Why do through all this effort?  Why?  Are you looking for love from Dunwitty?  For respect?  Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you.  So now what are you gonna do? 
Someone begins to pound on the bathroom door. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Will you please let me in?  I have to use the toilet. 
SLOAN You're gonna have to hold it in because we're not finished yet... 
She returns her attention to Delacroix. 
SLOAN (CONT'D) ...QUIT then. 
DELACROIX Even if money wasn't an issue, Dunwitty will still go ahead without me and that could be more dangerous. 
SLOAN What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up? 
DELACROIX I wouldn't bet against it.  My Negroidal ass is stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place. 
SLOAN Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal.  Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it. 
The banging starts again. 
MANAGER'S VOICE (O.S.) Please open this bathroom door immediately.  You are being very inconsiderate. 
Sloan unlocks the door and they exit. 
ANGLE ON 
Ladies' bathroom.  Sloan and Delacroix file past the strange looks of the manager and FIVE WOMEN waiting to use the bathroom as they rush in. 
INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING 
DELACROIX I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this.  This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy."  Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain. 
DUNWITTY To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right.  It's un-American.  I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job. 
DELACROIX I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after. 
DUNWITTY I want a hot, young white director. Maybe the kid, that pheenom who just did that hot new sexy Madonna video. 
DELACROIX You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot? 
DUNWITTY I just want you to meet him.  Keep an open mind. 
DELACROIX Besides, what does he know about Negroes? 
DUNWITTY Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective.  A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter?  With this kid, the possibilities are endless. 
DELACROIX What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video? 
DUNWITTY If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot. 
DELACROIX That's exactly my point.  Has he even directed actors before in anything? 
DUNWITTY No!!!  Just meet the guy.  That's all I'm asking.  Look, I'll even let you choose your own musical director.  You can have that. 
DELACROIX In the immortal words of Derrick Coleman, WHOOOPDEEDAMNDOO!!! 
DUNWITTY Derrick Coleman, he possessed all the talent in the world, coulda, shoulda, been a great ballplayer but alas D.C. didn't want it bad enough.  Delacroix, do you want it? Bad enough to kill for it?  Do you want it that much. 
Delacroix stares at Dunwitty. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NEXT DAY 
Delacroix, followed by Sloan, enters the room full of writers.

DELACROIX (CONT'D) Thanks, Ms. Lulu. 
LULU But I had several more poems. 
DELACROIX That's good.  We've seen enough. We'll get back to you. 
Lulu scurries off stage. 
RUTH (O.S.) Next. 
The Mau-Mau's run onto the stage, yelling and screaming. 
They are all fired up, in fact several fire their 9mm's into the ceiling. 
ANGLE - TWO SHOT

The booming track starts and the Mau-Mau's do their thing, bouncing all over the stage.  The lyrics about everything that is BLAK!!! 
ON DELACROIX 
A look of disbelief is on his face. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) Needless to say, the Mau-Mau's did not fit into our plans. 
ON SLOAN 
She's in shock, horrified. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) As I told Sloan, there's a black sheep in every family. 
BACKSTAGE - LATER THAT DAY 
Delacroix is screaming at the top of his lungs. 
She gives Mantan a kiss on his cheek. 
DELACROIX Wait a minute.  Hold up. 
They all laugh. 
DELACROIX (CONT'D) Can I kiss you too? 
MANTAN Naw.  I'll take the zero. 
DELACROIX You feel good, not nervous? 
MANTAN I feel fine. 
DELACROIX Not nervous?  Relaxed? 
MANTAN Sloan, will you take your boss out of here so I can get ready. 
EXT. SLEEP 'N EAT'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT 
Sloan and Delacroix enter the dressing room. 
INT. SLEEP 'N EAT'S DRESSING ROOM 
SLEEP 'N EAT How's the audience? 
DELACROIX Fired up. 
SLOAN How you feelin'? 
SLEEP 'N EAT Good.  I'm not sure about this material. 
DELACROIX The material is fine. 
Sloan cuts a look at this liar. 
SLEEP 'N EAT You really think so? 
DELACROIX We're trying to do something new here, some groundbreaking stuff. 
SLEEP 'N EAT It's the bone breaking stuff I'm worried about. 
SLOAN Everything's gonna be alright.  You and Mantan will be huge stars after tonight. 
SLEEP 'N EAT You really think so? 
DELACROIX Your life will never be the same. 
SLOAN Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready. 
INT. BACKSTAGE 
SLOAN We both lied to him. 
DELACROIX What do you want me to say? 
SLOAN Just don't lie to me. 
INT. STAGE - NIGHT 
HONEYCUTT, a rotund, elder black man who is one of cast members, is warming the audience up.

DELACROIX Good luck, Jukka.  Do a good show.

INT. SLEEP 'N EAT'S DRESSING ROOM 
Sleep 'N Eat is also getting dressed.  He wears a worn Pullman Porter uniform with red hat to match. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT 
Dunwitty with his black wife in hand, VERNA moves toward Delacroix and Sloan. 
DUNWITTY I want you to meet my lovely wife Verna.  Honey, this is Pierre Delacroix and Sloan Hopkins. 
VERNA Nice to meet you. 
DELACROIX Same here. 
SLOAN The pleasure is mine. 
VERNA My husband has been raving about the awesome work you've done.  How did you ever think of something like this?  It's absolutely brilliant.  Pure genius. 
DELACROIX I guess it was divine inspiration. 
VERNA Hope to see you both after the taping.  Congrats in advance. 
ON CONTROL BOOTH 
Verna and Dunwitty go to the front of the control booth.

SLEEP 'N EAT Show... 
INT. MANTAN'S DRESSING ROOM 
ON MIRROR 
Mantan in FULL BLACK FACE. 
MANTAN ...TIME!!! 
INT. STAGE - NIGHT 
The audience is in an uproar when the lights go down.  They applaud and they quiet as the CURTAIN GOES UP on a bucolic setting.  It is a combination of WATERMELON PATCH and COTTON FIELD. 
ON STAGE 
First Sleep 'N Eat then Mantan shuffles onto the stage. 
MANTAN This is my best friend Sleep 'N Eat. 
SLEEP 'N EAT And this is my very best friend Mantan. 
BOTH We're two real COONS! 
The audience lets out nervous laughter.  They don't know what to think. 
MANTAN We both left the hustle and bustle of Uptown, Harlem... 
SLEEP 'N EAT ...the big apple, New York, New York. 
MANTAN To come back to our roots. 
SLEEP 'N EAT Our Alabamy Home.  Now we're getting countrified.  We is Bama's. 
MANTAN No mo' "city slickers."  Ahh, can't you smell the sweet aroma of the ripe watermelons and high cotton? 
SLEEP 'N EAT Tell 'em what you mean Mistuh Mantan. 
MANTAN Well, thank you Mistuh Sleep 'N Eat. 
SLEEP 'N EAT Give or cousins some of dem educated feets. 
Mantan begins to do a slow, steady step. 
SLEEP 'N EAT (CONT'D) Cousins, first, second, third and distant, let's have Mantan take us all the way back to a much more simpler time.  A time wen men were men, women were women, and Neggras knew their place. 
The AUDIENCE is aghast.  Mantan has picked up the pace. He's tapping fast and furious. 
MANTAN Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell.  Yell, I'm tired of the drugs, the crack babies born out of wedlock to crackhead aids infested parents.  I'm tired of the inflated welfare rolls while good wholesome Americans bring less and less of their paycheck home every two weeks. I'm tired, you're tired, we're all tired of these so-called bible- thumping God fearing, whore mongling Professional athletes.  Aren't you tired of these basketball-dunking, football-running, hop-hip rapping ebonic-speaking sex offenders who got ten kids from ten different Ho's?  I know I am and so is Sleep 'N Eat. 
SLEEP 'N EAT You tellin' the truth. 
MANTAN Go to your windows and yell out, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised and battered bodies.  I'M SICK AND TIRED OF NIGGERS AND I'M NOT GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE! 
Mantan stops dancing and collapses. 
ON AUDIENCE 
They're stunned.  They can't believe what they've heard, what they've seen.  What they've been witness to. 
ON YOUNG WHITE COUPLE 
They look at the black people in the audience. 
ON YOUNG HIP-HOP BLACK MALE 
He starts to clap slowly. 
ON AUDIENCE 
Slowly more black people begin to applaud.  Slowly it sweeps up into the black people. 
The WHITE AUDIENCE, of course, has been waiting to see how their black brothers and sisters would react.  Now feeling comfortable and safe, they too being to join the applause. 
ON AUDIENCE 
The applause changes into laughter.  It is not nervous laughter we hear, but straight out RIOTOUS LAUGHTER. 
ON BLACK AND WHITE FACES 
The laughter is contagious. 
ON STAGE 
Mantan starts to move, he's coming back from the dead.  He slowly gets up from his prostate position as he HEARS: 
DELACROIX C'mon, Mommy.  Daddy hasn't been impressed with anything I've ever done.  From winning my fifth grade Spelling Bee to the present. 
ORCHID Peerless, last time, go see your father. 
EXT. PARK - NIGHT 
Mantan and Sloan are sitting on a park bench, nothing is being said.  He sits up and starts to do a dance for her. To her. 
ON BENCH 
Mantan is doing that "Mating" tap dance. 
SLOAN Are you trying to seduce me? 
He puts his index finger over his mouth - "Quiet." 
SLOAN (CONT'D) You think that's gonna work, huh? 
He quickly jumps up on the bench, does some intricate steps then pulls Sloan up from her sitting position. 
ON MANTAN AND SLOAN 
They kiss. 
EXT. I-95 SOUTH - MORNING 
Delacroix is driving "down south." 
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Delacroix adjusts the mirror so he can see himself.  HE SPEAKS TO US through the MIRROR 
DELACROIX I figured this was a good time to get away.  Just jump in my ride and go.  I always did my best thinking when I was driving alone.  I needed to think out clearly what I was going to do with this MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW. 
EXT. I-95 SOUTH 
Delacroix is driving on his way to "Ole Virginny." 
EXT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK - NIGHT 
Delacroix pulls up in the parking lot of a rinky-kink, funky, greasy BAR/CLUB/BAR-B-Q joint. 
CLOSE ON NEON SIGN 
"MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK" - most the letters do not light up, underneath it, "2-NITE - JUNEBUG." 
INT. MAMA'S SUGAR SHAK 
It's loud as hell as Delacroix enters this smoky, dark establishment. 
P.O.V. DELACROIX 
This must be a big night in here because the PATRONS are dressed to the nines.  What's in style down here is a lot different from what's happening en Nueva York.  Many of the men are dressed like PIMPS from 70's BLAXPLOITATION FILM, the ladies like HOOTCHIE MAMAS from "Luke" video. 
ON SUGAR SHAK 
Delacroix works himself through the crowded BAR/DISCO into another small room. 
ON COMEDY ROOM 
He walks into a small space where his father JUNEBUG is on the stage. 
ON JUNEBUG 
He is a good-looking man, the only speckle of gray in his hair betrays his age.  As he walks around the small stage doing his comedy stylings, he keeps a drink in one hand and sips it often. 
ON COMEDY ROOM 
Delacroix sits in the back so his father can't see him. 
ON DELACROIX 
He looks around. 
P.O.V. DELACROIX 
It's dead in here.  The room is nearly empty. 
ON TABLE 
A couple gets loud, arguing over something. 
ON JUNEBUG 
JUNEBUG 'Cuse me.  Please.  Can you please show me some respect.  I'm up here trying to make a living. 
MAN Mind yo' business. 
JUNEBUG Don't make me have to come over there and whoop you upside ya head. 
The sparse AUDIENCE laughs. 
JUNEBUG (CONT'D) Just messin' with ya.  But please if you and your lady need to discuss something, take it outside. Thank you. 
He continues on with his show. 
ON TABLE 
Delacroix walks over to the fighting couple. 
DELACROIX Brother man, that's my father up there and I drove a long way to see him perform.  Please take this fifty, go buy you and the young lady some drinks in the club. 
The guy looks him up and down. 
MANTAN ...dat's too much money.  I can't 'ford it.  I needs me a dress that cost no mo' than... 
SLEEP 'N EAT ...aconite get it dat cheap. 
MANTAN I'll buy her a less expensive dress, so I can have some money left over to take her out to dinner. 
SLEEP 'N EAT We should go out on a double date. 
MANTAN I heard ya lady is wild. 
SLEEP 'N EAT No.  That's her second cousin. Who's married to Li'l Bit. 
MANTAN Oh, because on our first date, she let me... 
SLEEP 'N EAT ...no, she didn't... 
MANTAN ...yes she did. 
SLEEP 'N EAT ...I heard different, thought that was... 
MANTAN ...not that time... 
SLEEP 'N EAT So when are you comin' to pick us up? 
MANTAN Around... 
SLEEP 'N EAT ...too early... 
MANTAN ...then what about... 
SLEEP 'N EAT ...too late, maybe around... 
MANTAN ...perfect... 
SLEEP 'N EAT That's what I like about you and me. We git along... 
MANTAN ...like macaroni and cheese... 
SLEEP 'N EAT ...like grits and butter... 
MANTAN ...like fried and chicken... 
SLEEP 'N EAT ...like sleep and eat. 
OFF-SCREEN we HEAR the VOICE of MASSA CHARLIE, he's the overseer of this plantation. 
MASSA CHARLIE (O.S.) Who goes in there? 
SLEEP 'N EAT We'd better hide. 
MANTAN It's dat mean, evil overseer Massa Charlie. 
They hide behind some boxes. 
MASSA CHARLIE I say who goes in there? 
BOTH There's nobody in here 'cept us chickens. 
Massa Charlie enters the chicken coops with a SHOTGUN blazing.  Sleep 'N Eat and Mantan do a jig as they try to escape the buckshot. 
ON AUDIENCE 
They're rolling down the aisles in hysterics. 
INT. CONTROL BOOTH 
Everyone in the booth is laughing uncontrollably.  Except Delacroix.  Even Sloan is dying. 
DELACROIX Who's side are you on? 
SLOAN I'm sorry, I can't help it.  It's too funny. 
Delacroix starts to crack a smile.  He is definitely trying to hold it in. 
INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
He sits in front of the television, which is off. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) It was the Day of Reckoning.  After a massive advertising and publicity campaign... 
CLOSER 
Delacroix stares at the blank screen. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...the public would finally get a chance to view Mantan.  I was feelin' a little bit like Dr. Frankenstein. 
INT. SLOAN'S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Sloan, Jessica, Mantan and Cheeba are gathered around the television in the small studio apartment, jabbering away. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) What would their reaction be?  I hadn't the foggiest. 
SLOAN Everybody shut up. 
ON TV SCREEN 
We see the OPENING of MANTAN - THE NEW MILLENNIUM MINSTREL SHOW.  It is in CLAYMATION.  Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat are doing a "jig."  Their noses and lips are done in a grotesque characterization, BIG WIDE BEGROIDAL NOSES and JUICY RED SAUCER SOUP COOLING LIPS. 
HONEYCUTT (V.O.) Calling all my cousins, you're about to take a trip down to Hang 'Em High Plantation, home of your two favorite coons, Mantan and Sleep 'N Eat. 
ON SLOAN, JESSICA, MANTAN, AND CHEEBA 
Mantan isn't happy. 
DUNWITTY I know all of you have seen the overnight ratings.  Through the roof.  But in this game you gotta be one, two, three steps ahead.  I introduce you to Myrna Goldfarb. She's the best media consultant in the biz. 
MYRNA First, I would like to say I love the show.  It's very courageous. My parents marched in Selma, Alabama with Dr. King. 
DELACROIX Why are you here? 
MYRNA Good question, straight to the point.  I like your style.  Because of the content of the show we can expect some spirited reactions. 
DUNWITTY Myrna is here to help us plan our strategy. 
MYRNA The best defense is offense. 
DELACROIX I thought it was the other way around. 
MYRNA You get my point.  I've mapped out some strategies to help bolster our position. 
SLOAN Which is? 
MYRNA That this is fun.  Nice wholesome fun. 
DUNWITTY Goldfarb, run it down for them. 
MYRNA The Mantan Manifesto.  Catchy ain't it?  Number One.  We gainfully employ African Americans, in front of and behind the cameras.  Two. Let the audience decide.  Three. Who put these critics in charge? These so-called cultural police? Four.  Who determines what is black? Five.  Mantan is a satire.  Six. If they can't take a joke, "F" 'em. 
DUNWITTY We all stick to this, it's smooth sailing. 
SLOAN It sounds kinda simplistic to me. 
MYRNA I've done my research. 
DELACROIX These are black folks we're talkin' about, not some lab mice in a cage. 
MYRNA Monsieur Delacroix, I got my PhD in African-American studies from Yale, so I do feel I'm qualified. 
DUNWITTY Let Myrna finish. 
MYRNA Thank you.  And always smile. 
DELACROIX Yeah, show dem pearly whites. 
She ignores him. 
MYRNA Wear Kente cloth, invoke the name of Dr. Martin Luther King, use the word "community" often when talking about Mantan.  And finally our biggest plus is you, Pierre Delacroix. 
DELACROIX Me? 
DUNWITTY Yes you! 
MYRNA This show was created, conceived by you, a non-threatening African- American male.  Voila.  End of argument.  It can't be racist because you're black. 
DELACROIX I'm not black.  I'm a NEGRO!!! 
INT. CNS HALLWAY - POST MEETING 
Sloan and Delacroix are walking in the hallway.  They keep getting interrupted by people who congratulate Delacroix on the success of the show. 
SLOAN So you have your small victory, now what? 
DELACROIX A small victory isn't that small when you've been use to losing. 
INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Sloan hands Delacroix a wrapped gift. 
DELACROIX What is this? 
SLOAN A gift. 
DELACROIX For what? 
SLOAN No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it. 
Delacroix opens his gift.  It is one of those old cast iron Black Collectibles.  This one is called "THE JOLLY NIGGER BANK," a head of a Negro, big lips, big nose, wide eyes. 
SLOAN (CONT'D) Put a coin in the hand. 
He puts a quarter in the hand. 
SLOAN (CONT'D) Watch this. 
She pushes the lever and the mouth opens, the quarter flies in and his eyes go to the top of his head. 
SLOAN (CONT'D) Read it on the back. 
Delacroix reads. 
DELACROIX The Jolly Nigger Bank. 
SLOAN This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century. 
DELACROIX Thanks. 
SLOAN I thought it was appropiate. 
DELACROIX Is that good or bad? 
SLOAN It's all good.  You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank.  Plus, I love these old black collectibles. 
DELACROIX How so? 
SLOAN To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human. 
CLOSE ON JOLLY NIGGER BANK 
DELACROIX (V.O.) To my astonishment, not only did the people in TV land love us, but also the critics. 
CLOSE ON DELACROIX 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) Mantan was being hailed as groundbreaking, barrier breaking, also earth shaking.  I looked forward to my awards.  Just vindication for all my hard work, all my talent that had been previously overlooked. 
INT. THEATER - NIGHT 
Delacroix sits in tux amongst many stars. 
ALEC BALDWIN The winner for Best New Sitcom is... The envelope please... 
A starlet hands him the envelope. 
ALEC BALDWIN (CONT'D) The winner is... Pierre Delacroix for Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show! 
Delacroix jumps out og his chair and starts sobbing.  Two ushers have to help him to the stage.  He is overcome with emotion.  The audience is on their feet with a standing ovation.  He hugs Alec Baldwin. 
DELACROIX Alec Baldwin, this is the very first time we've ever met, you don't know this, I'm your biggest fan and I want you to have my Emmy. It's for you, out of the deep bowels of my heart - I don't deserve this.  You take it. 
Alec Baldwin is shocked.  He grabs Delacroix in a bear hug and they both cry like babies. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) If I did that I'd be assured to work forever.  Delacroix the grateful Negro. 
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT 
Delacroix sits at a table in his lucky tux. 
WOODY HARRELSON The winner for Best Sit-Com is... 
Woody opens the envelope. 
WOODY HARRELSON (CONT'D) ...Pierre Delacroix for Mantan. Come on up and get your Golden Globe. 
Delacroix jumps out of his seat and sprints.  He gets down on the stage and starts to breakdance, even spinning on his head. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) That routine would go over like gangbusters.  I would be a dancing fool, Hollywood's new favorite Negro, move over Danny, Morgan, Samuel L., move over Whoopi. 
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
Delacroix is finishing up the meeting. 
DELACROIX I had it all planned.  To the T. 
INT. DANCE STUDIO - DAY 
Mantan is running rigorous rehearsal of The Pikaninnies. Over and over, repetition after repetition, Snowflake, Rastus, Sambo, Nigger Jim, Jungle Bunny and Aunt Jemima try to do an intricate dance step. 
MANTAN I'm tired of you pickaninnies messing up my choreography.  It goes like this. 
Mantan does the step with ease. 
MANTAN (CONT'D) Try it again. 
The dancers do it once more. 
MANTAN (CONT'D) Better. 
Cheeba walks in.  Mantan checks him out. 
MANTAN (CONT'D) Let's take a ten minute break. 
They quickly file past Cheeba without saying a word.  The rehearsal space is just the two. 
CHEEBA I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid. 
MANTAN What are you talkin' about? 
CHEEBA Jim Jones, y'know.  I'm not drinking the Kool-Aid. 
MANTAN Meaning? 
CHEEBA I'm out. 
MANTAN Good.  I've got a broken back from carrying you all these years anyway. 
CHEEBA So that's what you been doing? 
MANTAN Damn skippy. 
CHEEBA You're in this up till ya neck. 
MANTAN Don't shoot me, I'm just the piano players. 
CHEEBA You can walk away.  We both can. 
MANTAN Yeah, that's easy for you to do. You never had any talent. 
CHEEBA I'm so tired of you running that. I always worked hard for you.  You think I'm a leech, a kling-on, I quit. 
Cheeba walks out. 
MANTAN I'm the star of Mantan, so you do that.  Quit, walk away.  And don't come crawling back, either. 
INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT 
Mantan and Sloan ride in back.  He's still thinking about Cheeba. 
SLOAN Why don't you call him? 
MANTAN For what?  He left.  Not me. 
EXT. APOLLO THEATRE - NIGHT 
Now projectiles are raining down upon Mantan.  This has turned into a RUCKUS, a BROUHAHA, a DONNYBROOK.  Honeycutt races onto the stage to pull off the still tap dancing Mantan as the Harlem natives BUMRUSH the stage.  THE WORM HAS TURNED. 
ON MAU-MAU'S BOX 
Mantan, led by Honeycutt, runs for his life. 
ON MOB 
They chase him. 
ON BACKSTAGE DOOR 
Mantan is hauling ass. 
EXT. BACKSTAGE 
The door crashes open, Mantan rockets out into an open car door. 
ON CAR DOOR 
The door slams. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
The car spins away. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Delacroix is behind the wheel.  This is the most shaken we've seen Mantan to date. 
DELACROIX Pull ya self together. 
Mantan is distraught. 
DELACROIX (CONT'D) What are you?  A man or a mouse? Are you a punk?  Punking out on me? 
MANTAN No. 
DELACROIX You getting scared because some people don't like what you are doing? 
MANTAN Yo, DeLa, they tried to lynch my black ass up in dat piece. 
DELACROIX You've made it from the guttermost to the uppermost.  Don't you know you should never let them see you sweat.  Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? 
MANTAN Yeah. 
DELACROIX And now is definitely not the time to bitch up. 
EXT. HARLEM STREET - NIGHT 
Delacroix speeds away. 
INT. BET STUDIO - NIGHT 
Mantan is on the BET show with host TAVIS SMILEY. 
TAVIS SMILEY Our guest tonight is the extraordinary, talented performer, Mantan.  Thanks for coming in. 
MANTAN Tavis, thank you for having me. 
TAVIS SMILEY Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview.  You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here. 
MANTAN I'm more comfortable around my people. 
TAVIS SMILEY Let's jump right into it.  Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue.  How do you see all of this? 
MANTAN Yo, Tavis, check it out.  This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money.  Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins." 
TAVIS SMILEY Money and nothing else? 
MANTAN Money makes the world go round.  It ain't no joke being poor.  I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'?  I've lived on the street.  I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game. 
TAVIS SMILEY Is it inevitable that the game plays you? 
MANTAN No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand.  Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing.  If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it.  Or better yet write your own show.  Do it better. 
TAVIS SMILEY Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort? 
MANTAN I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple.  Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL.  It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem.  This is America.  Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else.  I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time. 
TAVIS SMILEY I admit, that's a very hard thing to do.  Quickly let's go to the phones before we pay the bills and hear from our proud sponsors, DA BOMB.  125% PURE PLEASURE MALT LIQUOR.  IT MAKES YOU WANNA GET YA FREAK ON AND TIMMI HILLNIGGER. 125% AUTHENTIC GIT-TOE GEAR WHEN YOU WANT TO BE GIT-TOED FABULOUS. (MORE) 
TAVIS SMILEY (CONT'D) Our first caller is Big Black from Brooklyn.  Go 'head. 
ON MANTAN 
BIG BLACK (O.S.) Microphone check, one, two.  One, two.  Yo Tavis, I be lovin' yo show but Mantan you is foul.  Why you perpetrating?  You a sellout. 
MANTAN That's our opinion. 
BIG BLACK (O.S.) You're a traitor to the race.  A tool for the Caucasoids. 
MANTAN Why?  Because I'm successful? Because I don't use "Causcasoids" as an excuse for not fulfilling my dreams? 
BIG BLACK (O.S.) I ain't hearing all dat noise.  You getting played and you don't even know it. 
TAVIS SMILEY And Big Black from Brooklyn, what do you do? 
BIG BLACK (O.S.) What do I do? 
TAVIS SMILEY What do you do? 
BIG BLACK (O.S.) I'm a revolutionary. 
SLOAN After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant. 
MANTAN And? 
SLOAN And what? 
MANTAN Stop playing me Sloan. 
SLOAN Just ask me what you want to know. 
MANTAN Oh, you gonna make me say it. 
SLOAN Say what, Manray? 
MANTAN Did you ever sleep with DeLa? 
SLOAN We did it one time, only once.  It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid.  Everything I've got I've earned. 
MANTAN Aw, c'mon. 
SLOAN That's ancient history.  That has nothing to do with you and I. 
MANTAN So you say.  Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top.  I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like "IHOP."  I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass. 
SLOAN Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa? 
MANTAN Don't try to change to the subject. 
SLOAN Why don't you answer? 
MANTAN I know I won't be your puppet. 
SLOAN You can go now. 
MANTAN I wuz leaving anyway, for good. 
INT. RECORDING STUDIO - NIGHT 
As usual, the clan is smoking and drinking DA BOMB, a thick marijuana haze hangs over the studio. 
1/16TH BLACK Yo, I got da bomb plan.  We gonna hook homeslice Mantan up nicely. 
He holds up a floppy disk. 
INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Delacroix sits behind the desk.  He's bought even more Black Collectibles, he's surrounded by them. 
ON DELACROIX 
He dials the phone. 
DELACROIX Hello, Mommy, how are you? 
ORCHID (O.S.) I'm doing okay.  Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once.  I thought you said there would be no buffoonery. 
DELACROIX You going to attack me too.  The show is a hit.  Aren't you happy for me? 
INT. ORCHID'S HOUSE 
ORCHID Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success. 
DELACROIX (O.S.) Yes I have, very hard.  Has Daddy called? 
ORCHID No. 
ON DELACROIX 
DELACROIX Not at all? 
ORCHID (O.S.) You know how your Daddy is. 
DELACROIX If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan. 
ORCHID (O.S.) I won't forget.  When are you coming up here to see your mother? 
DELACROIX Soon. 
Delacroix hangs up the phone.  He takes out some change from his pocket and puts a quarter in the hand of his Jolly Nigger Bank. 
TIGHT ON JNB 
Delacroix flips the lever and the quarter flies into the MOUTH as the EYES roll to the top of its HEAD. 
Delacroix does this several times.  CLOSEUPS of the BLACK COLLECTIBLES in the office. 
CLOSER ON JNB 
Delacroix is staring at the JNB when its MOUTH OPENS, a quarter flies in and its EYES roll to the top of its HEAD. 
ON DELACROIX 
He is incredulous. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) When I thought or imagined that my favorite Jolly Nigger Bank, an inanimate object, a piece of cold, cast iron, was moving by itself... 
Delacroix slowly, carefully approaches the bank and picks it off the table. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...I knew I was getting paranoid. Did I really see what I saw or was I buggin'? 
ON JNB 
It's stopped moving. 
ON AUDIENCE 
The THUNDEROUS ROAR is CUT OFF LIKE the LIGHTS, LIKE CON EDISON PULLS THE PLUG WHEN YOU DON'T PAY THE BILL. 
INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT 
Dunwitty is HYSTERICAL. 
DUNWITTY Stop the tape.  Stop the tape. Delacroix.  Get me Delacroix. 
INT. STAGE - NIGHT 
Manray speaks to the silence. 
MANRAY Cousins, I want all of you to go to your windows.  Go to your windows and yell, scream with all the life you can muster up inside your assaulted, bruised amd battered bodies. 
ON MANRAY 
MANRAY I'm sick and tired of being a nigger and I'm not gonna take it anymore. 
ON VARIOUS AUDIENCE MEMBERS 
Black and white.  Male and female.  Young and old.  All in black face. 
ON MANRAY 
He collapses onto the stage and the AUDIENCE sits on their hands.  Manray gets up and begins to dance. 
ON STAGE 
Dunwitty runs to Bunning. 
DUNWITTY Drop the curtain.  Drop the curtain. 
Bunning drops the curtain.  Security rushes onto the stage and grabs Manray. 
DUNWITTY (CONT'D) Escort him out the building now! 
MANRAY I wasn't finished doing my dance. 
DUNWITTY But you are finished.  Done. Nigga's like you are a dime a dozen. I'm gonna slide Honeycutt right into ya spot.  We won't miss a step. Get him outta here. 
The security guards move Manray as Dunitty glares at Delacroix.  Honeycutt is all smiles, he's being bumped to the top. 
DUNWITTY (CONT'D) DeLa, I'll deal with you next. 
EXT. BACKSTAGE 
The security guards toss Manray out the stage door.  Manray looks down the alley and it's empty except for a parked SUV. He picks himself up and does a joyous dance.  This is Manray's dance of Freedom. 
ON STREET 
The Big Black Chevy Suburban creeps down the alley to a dancing Manray and comes to rest right in front of him. Manray tries to shield his eyes from the hi-beam headlights. 
MANRAY Whaddup? 
No one comes out. 
MANRAY (CONT'D) Whaddup? 
The doors open and the Mau-Mau's file out. 
BIG BLACK You truly are a dancing fool. 
1/16TH BLACK Yo Black, you looking for trouble. 
MANRAY Don't start none, won't be none. 
The Mau-Mau's are dying laughing.  Manray tries to walk through them.  They block him.  Manray attempts to climb over the suburban.  He's quickly nabbed, give a good ole Brooklyn Beatdown, then thrown into the rear of the vehicle. 
EXT. EMPTY BROOKLYN STREET - NIGHT 
The Mau-Mau Mobile rolls up to an abandoned factory. 
ON CHEVY SUBURBAN 
The Mau-Mau's quickly carry Manray out from the back of the vehicle into the factory. 
INT. FACTORY - NIGHT 
Manray sits, feet and hands tied, in the middle of a cavernous space.  A digital video camera stands on a tripod in front of him. 
BIG BLACK You is one dead nigger. 
MANRAY What did I do? 
BIG BLACK What did you do? 
The Mau-Mau's laugh. 
BIG BLACK (CONT'D) Brothers, he asks what did he do? 
DOUBLE BLACK If you don't know there is nuthin' we can do for you. 
BIG BLACK Nigga, you will be executed. 
ON MANRAY 
His face says he can't believe this is happening. 
MANRAY For singing and dancing? 
1/16TH BLACK You will be done in front of the world. 
MONTAGE 
Police squads, SWAT Teams are busting into the wrong homes, apartments, projects, hi-tech computer labs looking for the Mau-Mau's. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) SWAT teams all up and down the East Coast busted in on known dissidents looking for Manray.  All the tips called in, info gathered through surveillance proved for naught. 
INT. X-FORCE WAR ROOM 
BARNETT The both of you should go home.  We will keep you abreast. 
SLOAN This is looking like a needle in a haystack.  It's hopeless. 
Delacroix holds Sloan as he leads her out.  She is having difficulty breathing with her asthma. 
DELACROIX Thank you for your help. 
BARNETT The X-Force always gets their man. 
INT. DELACROIX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
He sits in front of his GIANT SCREEN, on the desk in front of him is the 3/4 inch cassette Sloan gave him.  He picks it up and turns it on. 
DELACROIX (V.O.) It was ten o'clock and the Dance of Death was about to commence. 
ON MONITOR 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) Since a lot of people still didn't have computers, the networks sought a court order to carry it live, taking the feed off the internet. It was granted.  A life snuff broadcast right into your living room. 
ON DELACROIX 
DELACROIX (V.O.) (CONT'D) I had to give it to the Mau-Mau', they definitely had a sense of irony.  They chose www.nigger.com as the website to pirate. 
INT. FACTORY - NIGHT 
The Mau-Mau's ironically wear WHITE MASKS, they stand behind the tied-up Mantan.  A device alters their voices. 
BIG BLACK We are LIVE on the cyberspace. Whereas Mantan is a TOM... 
BLACK BLACK Whereas Mantan is a disgrace... 
SMOOTH BLACK Whereas Mantan is a head-scratching, foot-shuffling Negro... 
1/16TH BLACK Whereas, whereas, where's the ass? 
The Mau-Mau's laugh. 
BIG BLACK Whereas Mantan the dancing fool, you are condemned to death. 
JO BLACK The Dance of Death. 
1/16th Black unties Manray. 
MONTAGE 
WE SEE DELACROIX, SLOAN, CHEEBA WITH LOURDESE, DUNWITTY, JUNEBUG AND DOT, ORCHID, THE X-FORCE WATCHING THIS SPECTACLE ON COMPUTERS OR TV SCREENS. 
ON COMPUTER SCREEN 
We see a CARTOON, Yosemite Sam is shooting at the feet of Bugs Bunny with his six-shooter in each hand.  Bugs Bunny is doing a fast dance, dodging bullets. 
ON MONITOR 
The Mau-Mau's shoot at the feet of Manray. 
BIG BLACK Dance nigger. 
Manray taps. 
SMOOTH BLACK You got anything to say for yourself? 
MANRAY If you're gonna kill me, kill me. 
SMOOTH BLACK Don't worry. 
INT. SLOAN'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
She is having an asthma attack, it was brought on by the proceedings.  Sloan uses her inhaler. 
INT. FACTORY - NIGHT 
Each Mau-Mau has a 9mm and is firing it at the feet of Manray.  They scream "Faster!" and "Dance!" Manray is hoofing.  He's never tapped this fast, at this breakneck pace, ever.  But it's evident his dance is one of defiance. He's not dancing to stay alive. 
INT. DELACROIX'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
He screams at the monitor. 
DELACROIX Don't dance.  Don't do it. 
INT. FACTORY 
The Mau-Mau's have noticed Manray's strong will, his pride and they don't like it.  They shoot even more at his feet. 
BIG BLACK You ain't Blak. 
DOUBLE BLACK Blak you ain't. 
SMOOTH BLACK You a Oreo.  Not Blak.  Not BLAK. 
The Mau-Mau's start to chant, "Blak, blak, blak." 
INT. SLOAN'S APARTMENT 
She hears this and quickly picks up the phone to call the authorities.

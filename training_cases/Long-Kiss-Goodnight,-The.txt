INT. BARREN GREY OFFICE - NIGHT 
THERE'S THE GIRL. The one in bed moments ago. She and Henessey are dividing a wad of bills. 
GIRL We gotta stop using bums. 
MITCH (lights a smoke) Forget it. They looked like cops. We pulled it off, didn't we? 
GIRL It was embarrassing. 
MITCH You want I should hire actors, for Chrissake? These guys are cheap, they work for food. 
GIRL Uh-huh. So, when they puke all over you is that, like, a refund? 
MITCH Trin, I'm pissin' myself over here, you're so funny. What's this? 
He indicates an envelope earmarked for him. Labeled in magic marker: SAMANTHA CAINE. 
TRIN New case, honest to God chick with amnesia. You want the job? 
Henessey opens the envelope. Extracts a black and white HEAD SHOT of Samantha, says immediately: 
HENESSEY Yep. Yep, yep, yep. 
Stares, mesmerized. Trin peers over his shoulder: 
TRIN Wasn't there a lady on TV named Samantha? Had a magic nose or something. 
HENESSEY 'Bewitched', yeah. Good show. Chick lived with a faggy guy, then in the last season it was a different faggy guy. Okay. Here's what we do; get on the horn to amnesia chick, tell her yes. Then tell her in 1967 she promised to give me a blow job. Worth a try, right? 
EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - NIGHT 
SAMANTHA and HAL bid goodnight to their friends and neighbors. Hal steers her away from a middle-aged teacher. 
HAL Christ, guy's all over you like a cheap suit. 
SAMANTHA That's funny, there's a cheap suit all over him like a cheap suit. 
She notices EARL sitting in the bushes by the side of the building. He is speaking intently to the gerbil. 
HAL Oh, boy. Someone's gotta take my father home. I'm plowed. 
Samantha takes the keys from him. Breathes deeply of the chill night air. Smiling. Surveys the scene... their friends. The neighborhood. Sighs: 
SAMANTHA This is all I ever wanted. 
At which point, young Caitlin says: 
CAITLIN How would you know? 
ESTABLISHING SHOT - STATE PRISON - OHIO - NIGHTTIME 
Switch gears: A grim, grey building. Guarded. Patrolled. 
INT. PRISON - TELEVISION VIEWING ROOM - EVENING 
A tired TV set drones to an audience of one. Let's call him ONE-EYED JACK. In fact, let's give him one eye, the other replaced by a PATCH. He smokes cigarettes, stubs them out on the chair's armrest. Throws offhand glances at the TV screen. 
NEWS ANCHOR (ON T.V.) ...So much for the flame-swallowing Santa of Boone County. Meanwhile, KTVA news journeyed to Upper Sandusky, where Santa's own *Mrs*. Kringle turned out to celebrate her hubby's worldwide tour. After one look at her, I'm thinking Santa got what he wanted this Christmas. 
The happy news chatter continues. Jack isn't listening. Jack isn't talking or breathing either. He's simply STARING at the TV screen, jaw slack... 
ONE-EYED JACK Gotta be fuckin' kidding. No. No way. SHIIIT!! 
He SCREAMS as we CUT TO: 
EXT. WOODLANDS - WITH SAMANTHA - DRIVING 
If you had to pick a night to die horribly, you'd be hard pressed to find a nicer one. A country highway. Bathed in moonlight. Crusted with snow. Pontiac Sunbird, wending its way through the wooded slopes. 
INT. SUNBIRD - SAME TIME 
SAMANTHA drives while Earl (the SANTA we saw earlier) reclines, still drunk. 
EARL You're married what now, five years...? 
He makes a thumb circle. Jabs his finger in and out of it: 
EARL You and Hal, how often you two...? 
SAMANTHA Stick our fingers in out hands and pull them out again? Every chance we get. Shut your piehole. 
EARL Don't get all snippy... 
SAMANTHA Earl, do me a favor. Every few words say "hic" and have bubbles come out your mouth, okay? 
EARL Goddamnit, I'm not drunk. Would a drunk man have this much raw talent? 
He starts playing the Hawaiian nose harp. In Sam's ear, she can't help it, snorts laughter -- 
She hoists her onto the seat. Caitlin cries and hollers. 
SAMANTHA You gonna be afraid of things all your life? Huh? That what you want? 
CAITLIN My wrist hurts...! 
*Snap*. Something lets go. Suddenly Samantha's right in her face: 
SAMANTHA Life is pain. Get used to it. See, you *will* ride this bike home, princess. You will ride it and you will not fall again, *is that understood*...? 
Eyes cold and lifeless. She is not herself. CUT TO: 
INT. SAMANTHA'S HOUSE - TWILIGHT 
CAITLIN huddles on the steps, itching at her brand new WRIST CAST. Eavesdropping on her parents. In the kitchen a counter- top TV is on, the Three Stooges. Samantha is on the phone, saying: 
SAMANTHA Yes, I'm three blocks past the gas station... Right. Thank you Mr. Henessey, I'll see you shortly. 
She hangs up as HAL ENTERS behind her... She doesn't turn around. Samples the topping of a cream pie. Stares at the linoleum floor. He regards her with angry, vindictive eyes: 
HAL She rode all the way home. She didn't fall, not once. She didn't cry. (beat) You're good. You should work with kids, you know that? 
SAMANTHA She said her wrist hurt. I didn't know it was broken, God. I can't even remember what I said to her...! 
Hal takes a breath, composes himself. 
HAL We can still make six o'clock mass, you coming? 
Sam surveys her perfect kitchen. Runs her hand over a hanging pot. Looks sadly at her husband. Whispers: 
SAMANTHA A private detective's coming by, he... he's found something. (beat) I may have to go away. For a bit. Now please leave me alone. 
HAL Go away. With a detective. Jesus, it's the holidays, Sam -- 
SAMANTHA Are you deaf? I said leave me alone. Go to church. Drink blood. Drink some for me. 
They stand in tableau. An electric silence... Broken quite suddenly by the sound of SINGING. CHRISTMAS CAROLERS. Outside the front door. The sweet strains of "God Rest Ye Merry, Gentlemen" wafts in through the window. 
Except the sweet strains ain't so sweet. These carolers are TERRIBLE. Missing by a country octave. Sam and Hal look at each other, what the hell...? 
EXT. THE FRONT PORCH - JUST OUTSIDE THE DOOR - NIGHT 
THE CAROLERS continue their interesting rendition. Snowflakes fall. All is quiet. All is bright. Especially bright is the SHOTGUN BARREL pressed to the throat of the lead soprano. HE- 109. Over and under combo. Shotgun on top. HE cannon on bottom. You'd sing shitty too. 
INT. HOUSE - SAME 
Samantha hurries to the door. Carrying a bowl of festive M&M's. Just as she gets to the door, the singing STOPS. Footfalls running away, that's odd... She opens the door. Carolers, gone. She's eye to eye with ONE-EYED JACK. 
ONE-EYED JACK Evening Charly. Long time. 
He swings the big GUN. Slams the barrel into her. Glass shatters, M&M's everywhere. She gapes at him, dumbstruck, unable to THINK... Hurry it up, lady, we need a decision, live or *die* -- 
SHE GRABS THE GUN BARREL. Wrenches the gun...! On the steps CAITLIN howls, eyes like saucers -- 
CAITLIN Mommy...! 
SAMANTHA GET OUUTTTTT!!!! 
Sam's cry is a veritable shriek. HAL LAUNCHES himself from the kitchen doorway. Pounces on Jack, snarling -- brave, useless. For his trouble, gets three broken ribs and a trip to the fireplace, airborne. Comes down. Catches fire. ROLLS, over and over on broken ribs -- 
JACK kicks Samantha in the gut. She collapses onto the stairs. Splinters the banister. That's when he sees CAITLIN. Top of the stairs, paralyzed. 
SAMANTHA NO!!!! 
Jack is already moving forward. SPIN-COCKS the shotgun, draws a bead -- Promptly slips on festive M&M's. Goes down. Gun goes off, WHAM-! A flat concussion. The banister EXPLODES. A storm of wood chips, as SAMANTHA surges up the stairs, toward her daughter -- 
JACK. On the ground. Fires, *wham*--! The wall DISAPPEARS three inches from Caitlin's head. Blown to shreds, you can see outdoors. Samantha doesn't miss a beat. Grabs her daughter -- flings her OUTSIDE. Through the hole in the wall. Takes her by the belt and fucking HURLS her out into space...! 
EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - SAME TIME 
Two stories up. The kid is ejected, flailing. Floats in SLOW MOTION. Across a ten foot gap -- INTO THE TREEHOUSE. Sails head over heels into the place. Hits with a CRASH. Alive and unhurt. 
BACK INSIDE THE HOUSE 
Samantha didn't even look. Didn't need to. Here comes JACK. Up the staircase. Reloading. Samantha launches herself down the stairs. COLLIDES, head on -- Down they go. Jack, rolls to his feet. Propels her into the KITCHEN. 
INT. KITCHEN - SAME TIME 
She hits, spray of cat food. SKIDS. Across the linoleum, slams to a stop. Hard. Cupboard pops open, out comes the IRONING BOARD. Falls into place, SNAP--! 
A GUN BLAST disintegrates it. Reveals Sam, cowering behind. 
ONE-EYED JACK I want my eye back, bitch. 
Samantha struggles to her feet. Dazed. Jack abandons the shotgun. Takes the IRON down from its spot on the shelf -- Slams it against her head. 
ONE-EYED JACK Goddamn you. Fight me. What's wrong with you, *fight* me! 
CLOSE ON TV: Stooge Joe Besser mugs wildly, takes a pie in the face. 
INT. STORAGE FACILITY - DAY 
An old, walrus-mustached IRISHMAN ushers them down a concrete hallway. The old man hangs back with Henessey. Whispers: 
WALRUS MAN The elder Trelawney rented to her in '87, aye. Ne'er could bring himself to dispose of her things. I'faith, she's welcome to whatsoe'er she wishes, for ne'er has trod these walls a lass so easy on the eye, divil take me if I'm lyin'. 
Henessey lights a cigarette, says: 
HENESSEY Do me a favor. Say, "Always after me Lucky Charms." 
ANGUS "Always after me Lucky Charms." 
HENESSEY Thanks. Just needed to hear that. 
INT. STORAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Drab, musty. Filled with disused tables, lamps, farm implements... Jimmy Hoffa watches TV in the corner. 
HENESSEY See anything you recognize? 
SAMANTHA Yeah, this dirt used to be outside my window, shut up and let me look. (sighs) I'm sorry, Mr. Henessey, I'm a little on edge. 
She pauses. Surveys the musty compartment, faraway look in her eye... says softly: 
SAMANTHA I can feel her. Like a ghost. (beat) We could walk away, you know. There's still time, we could just... leave her dead. 
She hefts a SUITCASE onto a bench. OPENS it -- Draws a sharp breath: 
SAMANTHA Ay-i-yi! 
Clothes to kill for. Smooth velvet. Creamy silk. The finest, the best. The sexiest. Sam peeks at the tags: 
SAMANTHA Size four, no way. You know how long it's been since I could wear a size four? (beat) Can't be mine. Can they...? 
She checks the case for INITIALS -- C.E.B. Who...? 
Henessey grunts. In his book, well dressed is clean underwear. Holds up a small manila envelope. 
HENESSEY Unmailed envelope. Addressed to a guy. 
SAMANTHA What's in it? 
HENESSEY Another guy's address. Two addresses, is basically what I'm saying. 
Meanwhile, her hands, still pawing through the suitcase... A SHAPE. She feels it. At the bottom of the case. Lifts up the mound of fabric -- HKM-40 sniper rifle. Disassembled. Sam looks like she just took a stomach punch. 
Up until now, it could've been adrenaline. She could still be just a schoolteacher. A rifle, that changes everything. She plunks the clothing back in place. Hides it. 
HENESSEY Anything else in there? 
SAMANTHA Hmm...? Uh, no. Just... more clothes. 
HENESSEY Yeah, well take a look at this. 
He holds up the envelope: addresses to one *Nathan Windeman*. Fishes in his coat, brings out Samantha's CHECK. Written to him, earlier that day... identical handwriting. CUT TO: 
INT. COLONIAL STYLE HOME - LATE AFTERNOON 
NATHAN WINDEMAN is in a bad mood. A frail-looking man, mid- seventies. Tiredly spooning a bowl of soup. His sister ALICE watches TV nearby. In her lap, a Pomeranian cleans itself. Windeman scowls: 
NATHAN Alice, please...? 
Alice stares at him. Uncomprehending. 
NATHAN Your dog, Alice. It and my appetite are mutually exclusive. 
ALICE What's wrong with the dog? 
NATHAN It's simple. He's been licking his asshole for three straight hours. I submit to you that there's nothing there worth more than an hour's attention, and I should think whatever he's attempting to dislodge is either gone for good or there to stay. *Wouldn't you agree*? 
Theatrical? Nah. The old bat scoops up her pooch and beats feet for the door. THE PHONE RINGS. Nathan snatches it up: 
NATHAN Hello? 
The voice is soft. Controlled: 
SAMANTHA (O.S.) Hello, Mr. Windeman, I got this number from a realtor in Pennsylvania. I'd like to speak with you. 
NATHAN Who... who is this? 
SAMANTHA You tell me, Mr. Windeman. 
Nathan pales. Blinks once. Twice. Manages: 
NATHAN ...Charly...? 
SAMANTHA (O.S.) My full name, please. 
NATHAN God, it really is you...!? Chapter, they think you're dead, *everyone* thinks -- 
Now Henessey shivers. Cranks the wheel as we CUT TO: 
EXT. HILLTOP - OVERLOOKING TOWN - NIGHT 
SAMANTHA flops on the frozen ground in a stand of pine trees. 
HENESSEY Where the shit did you get that? 
No answer. She deftly assembles the SNIPER RIFLE. Rests the rifle barrel on a dead branch. Flicks on the starlight scope. 
HENESSEY Sam, Goddammit, you're gonna kill someone! Hey! 
She ignores him. Focuses through the scope. POV SAMANTHA: Framed in spectral GREEN, the diner's interior. Hostages. Crying mothers. Children, catatonic. 
Through a tiny window -- a limited view of the KITCHEN. He's in there. Girl, eating both barrels. Samantha's jaw tightens. 
HENESSEY The diner...? That's half a mile away, are you fucking crazy? 
SAMANTHA HK M-40 assault rifle. At three hundred yards, vertical drop six inches. 
Mr. Shotgun leans in. WHISPERS something to the waitress. 
SAMANTHA Shit. He's gonna do the girl. 
HENESSEY How the fuck can you tell? 
She steadies the rifle. Takes aim. 
SAMANTHA I read lips. 
She fires. Splintered CRACK-! 
INT. DINER 
Mr. Shotgun dies on his feet. Outgoing matter. Flung. Spattered on the grill where it sizzles along with burnt hamburger. He drops. Screams. Pandemonium. 
EXT. HILLTOP - MOMENTS LATER 
Samantha slams the trunk of the Chrysler. Gets in the passenger side without a word. Henessey pulls away. 
INT. CAR - DRIVING - SAME 
Samantha stares straight ahead. Gives a high, brittle laugh. 
SAMANTHA See? Took care of it. Knew I could. 
She laughs again. Henessey favors her with a look reserved for people with major deformities. Suddenly she says: 
SAMANTHA Pull over. 
He stops the car. She gets out. Stumbles across the shoulder. Kneels. Throws up. Henessey watches. Lights a smoke with trembling hands. 
SAMANTHA Had to, he... he would've killed her... Had to... Oh God I took him, such a good shot... I felt proud of it, such a shot, Jesus, *how could I be proud*...? (sobs) I'm scared... I want to go home... 
Henessey kneels beside her awkwardly. She clutches his shoulder. Presses her head to his chest. Cries. 
EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT 
Yes, it certainly is. CUT TO: 
INT. SITUATION BRIEFING ROOM - SAME TIME 
Three stories below the White House proper. THE PRESIDENT is seated in his robe and slippers. Before him sits a panel of three: National Security Adviser; Deputy Director of the CIA; and ANOTHER MAN in his sixties, sporting a distinguished mane of silver hair. The President addresses him: 
PRESIDENT *Mister Perkins*. (frowns) Please, say it again, I'm a little slow. Better yet, I'll try it. You lost an operative, a trained counterassassin, and you just saw her on TV in a Christmas parade. 
The silver-haired man appears unperturbed. And no, by the way, it didn't escape us that he shares his surname with Caitlin's TEDDY BEAR, the one Mom named -- He nods, says: 
SILVER-HAIRED MAN On TV, that's correct. It's two weeks old, intelligence just caught it. 
PRESIDENT You recruited this woman in the late seventies? 
SILVER-HAIRED MAN For Chapter, yes. I was a friend of her father's, you see, and... I took her in. 
PRESIDENT Well, it looks like she returned the favor, now doesn't it? (throws up his hands) Unbelievable. You people, you dump this on me, then next week you're screaming, "Where's our funding?" Shit. I'll tell you where it is, can you say health care? 
The head of the CIA pipes up: 
CIA DIRECTOR Mr. President, please calm down. The CIA bears no responsibility for this problem. 
PRESIDENT Thanks for sharing, Kent. How many double agents you got on the payroll, last count...? 
CIA DIRECTOR Sir! That controversy has been thoroughly dealt with, and if there still exists a leak, perhaps this... woman agent of his -- 
SILVER-HAIRED MAN If I may, sir, Colonel Baltimore hasn't had classified access since (beat) But thank you, Kent, for trying to fuck me in the ass. 
He directs his baleful gaze at the President. Lights a pipe. 
SILVER-HAIRED MAN I'm afraid rooting out double agents may have to wait. The primary threat is the woman. Her specialty is counterassassination, a horseshit turn of phrase which implies the other fellow shot first, but in point of fact she's a takeout artist of the first order. Nearly disposed of our friend the Beard down in Cuba a few years back. Specializes in long rifles, accurate to a mile and a half. Presumed dead; now, after eight years, back in the field, agenda unknown. She knows enough to hurt us. I'm frightened. Understand? 
He pats her arm. Smiles reassuringly. A pause. She stares. 
SAMANTHA That's it? That's your helpful story? Jesus Christ! 
HENESSEY No, see, all's I'm saying is you're not alone. 
SAMANTHA Oh, shut up. 
HENESSEY Fine. I gotta use the head. 
He stands, heads off. Samantha nervously lights a cigarette. The bartender suddenly puts a BEER in front of her. She reaches for her purse. He waves it away, points beside her. She turns... 
The assassin called TIMOTHY sits down two stools away. 
TIMOTHY For you. Another in a long line of bad investments. 
SAMANTHA Excuse me? 
TIMOTHY Just saw the ring on your finger. 
He reveals a surprisingly WINNING smile, says: 
TIMOTHY Do I know you from somewhere...? 
Grimaces: 
TIMOTHY Whoa. Back up. Total pickup line, let's forget I said that. 
Still staring in her eyes. Noting absolutely NO RECOGNITION on her features. She gives him a cursory smile. 
SAMANTHA Thanks for the drink. But no. I don't know you. 
Timothy nods slowly. 
TIMOTHY No, you don't, do you...? I'd know if you did. I can tell if someone's lying. (smiles) Sorry to bother you. 
He takes his own drink and crosses to a back booth. Sits, a very puzzled look on his face. Adjusts his coat collar, whispers into a concealed transmitter: 
TIMOTHY Okay, people, I got what I needed. Wait until she comes out. Then do them both. (beat) Walk soft, we got local law. 
He sits back as TWO SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES suddenly enter, doffing their stetsons. Cross to the bar. HENESSEY, coming out of the bathroom. Sees the deputies. Grabs SAMANTHA by the elbow. Tosses down a fin, steers her toward the door. 
SAMANTHA (sotto) What are you doing? 
HENESSEY Pork. On your nine. 
SAMANTHA So? 
HENESSEY So you shot a guy in the head yesterday. We wait outside. 
SAMANTHA It's freezing. 
HENESSEY Too bad. People shouldn't shoot other people in the head. Just themselves. During that show with the little girl who's a robot. 
EXT. SALT & PEPPER LOUNGE - SAME TIME 
They emerge into the chill air. Breath pluming from their mouths. Samantha surveys the parking lot. Grabs Henessey, points -- 
A LATE-MODEL CAR pulls into the gravel lot. Stops. 
SAMANTHA Bingo. That's an old guy's car. 
HENESSEY How do you know? 
SAMANTHA Because there's an old guy in it. Come on. 
They cross toward the car. She frowns, points to his coat. 
SAMANTHA Gun bulge. 
HENESSEY You think I'm gonna shove it down my pants? Shoot my damn dick off. 
SAMANTHA So now you're a sharpshooter? 
HENESSEY Ho, ho. 
As they approach the other car, the engine stops. The door opens and a middle aged man emerges -- IT AIN'T NATHAN. He pauses, lighting a cigarette. 
SAMANTHA Mr. Windeman...? 
She strides right up, Henessey in tow. Flashes a dazzling smile -- *Slow motion*. The guy DROPS HIS LIGHTER, darts a hand inside his coat with practiced ease... Pulls out a SILENCED PISTOL. 
SAMANTHA Oh, SHIT! 
*Slow motion*. Samantha tackles Henessey. Hurls them both to the ground... During their fall, STUFF HAPPENS: 
She clutches his sportcoat -- Grips his .38 special THROUGH THE FABRIC and squeezes... A sharp report, BAM-! Another, BAM-! The jacket, shredded. HITMAN just caught two in the chest. He goes over backwards, gun spitting -- 
Sam and Henessey hit the ground. *Back to regular speed*. Henessey rolls over, stunned. Samantha's staring at her hand, wondering how in the hell it just did that. 
HENESSEY *What happened to bulletproof*? 
NATHAN *The side windows were next, I swear*. 
BACK WITH TIMOTHY 
Watching them go. Oh, well. He tried, right...? Did his best, tomorrow's another day -- 
Without missing a beat, Timothy walks out in the middle of the road. ANOTHER CAR, coming. Sports car. He snaps in a fresh clip. Raises his fist and PUMPS ONE through the fast- approaching windshield. Kills the driver. 
The car throws a skid. Slewing SIDEWAYS at him. Onrushing juggernaut, immense...! 
He vaults the hood without breaking stride. Catches the drive- side doorhandle, jerks -- then he's in, and out comes the corpse and the car *never stops moving*. 
Completes an out-of-control 360, showering muddy water... and then he's stomping the gas. Utterly relentless. Leaving behind a wet and very surprised-looking corpse. 
INT. STOLEN CAR 
Timothy GUNS IT, eyes locked dead ahead on the Le Sabre -- Hears a SCREECH. Whips his eyes to the rearview mirror: POLICE CRUISER. Fishtailing onto the road behind him. Falls in behind, SIREN wailing. One of the deputies from the bar. 
INT. NATHAN'S CAR - DRIVING - SAME TIME 
Nathan fishes a gun from his coat. Hands it to Samantha. 
NATHAN Here, you might as well have one too. 
SAMANTHA My God. How many do you carry? 
NATHAN Three. One shoulder, one hip, and one right next to Mr. Wally -- (pats his groin) Where most patdowns never reveal it, as an agent is often reluctant to feel up another man's groin. 
Henessey looks out the back windshield, says: 
HENESSEY Got a tail. 
Nathan looks, SWEARS. The chase car's gaining on them. 
NATHAN Lucky bastard found the only cool car in the fucking midwest. 
He accelerates into a curve. Rockets past a connecting road, as, without warning -- ANOTHER COP CAR skids out of the side road, after him. The other deputy... 
TIMOTHY, boxed. Going too fast, swerves...! PLOWS into the deputy headlong. BROADSIDES him. Glass flies. The cop car's TIRES blow out as it's SPUN 180 degrees... Timothy's car careens into a GULLEY -- 
BAM-! Hits a dead stop. Hood shears off, goes flying. Back end sticking up, tires spinning... The horn blares continuously. 
UP ABOVE: The other cop arrives, brakes to a halt -- Door opens and out he comes. Helps Deputy #2 clamber from his crippled black-and-white. 
Together they leap down into the gulley, guns drawn. Cringing as the long HOOOOOOOONNNNNK continues unabated. Approaching the crashed car. Walking up, guns at their sides... TWO SHOTS. They jitter and twitch. Topple over dead, slide to the bottom of the gulley. 
INSIDE THE CAR, we see that a very annoyed Timothy is also very conscious. Splayed against the driver's side door. Holding one hand down on the horn, HOOOOOOOONNK... He releases it. Horn stops. On the radio Conway Twitty is singing. He puts a shot through the radio. Silences it. 
Climbs from the car and stares off down the road. Of Nathan and his companions, there is neither whisper nor breath... 
EXT. ROADSIDE - LATE AFTERNOON 
Nathan has pulled over in a grove of pine trees. The car is covered with branches. He watches through a gap as two police cars go by on the distant highway. 
NATHAN Your father was in the British SIS, assigned to the Irish situation. After he was murdered in 1971, his friend Perkins recruited you for Chapter, a black bag operation working out of the U.S. State Department. 
Charly is overloaded. Trying to keep up, not wanting to: 
NATHAN Fall, 1987: Presidential orders come down. You're to flush out a terrorist by the name of Daedalus. You never complete the mission, electing instead to die, of all things, despite clear orders to the contrary. And dead you remain until, without preamble, you re-emerge, eight years later and fifteen pounds heavier. 
SAMANTHA Would you lay off the weight? 
NATHAN I think we can safely assume Daedalus is aware of your resurrection and is attempting to reverse it. *Damn*, I can't drive around in this thing. (beat) Any idea where we can go to stash this car? 
IN SAMANTHA'S LAP 
Her fingers unconsciously fiddle with something. Damp, crumpled. The ENVELOPE. One address left. 
SAMANTHA This address...? I... I recognize it now. I think it belongs to a friend. 
Henessey stares at her. As Nathan reaches for the envelope, his coat falls open and Samantha GASPS; his left side is soaked with blood. 
NATHAN Perhaps you'd best drive. 
EXT. HOUSE IN THE COUNTRY - DAY 
The house is actually an old converted MILL. Beyond it, frozen landscape stretches to the lakeshore. In the BARNYARD, a scruffy looking COWBOY TYPE is splitting logs on a tree stump. Drops the axe. Scoops up an armload of firewood. Comes around the corner -- 
Drops the logs, startled. AN UNLIKELY TRIO approaches. NATHAN, sweating. Pasty. Levels a revolver. Samantha says: 
SAMANTHA Don't be afraid, we don't want to hurt you. (beat) I just want to know who you are. 
Seeing her, his eyes go wide -- He locks her in a whooping BEAR HUG, shouts: 
MAN CHARLY, BABY!! 
Picks her up, SPINS HER around, laughing... Henessey and Nathan stare. Befuddled. 
NATHAN Arms broker, man without a face. Veteran of Baader-Meinhoff and the Red Brigades. He's rumored to be based in the U.S. Doesn't travel much, they say. Too afraid of metal detectors, the poor sod's got a foot- long piece of steel in his leg. 
At which point, Henessey stops. Frowns. 
HENESSEY Come again? 
NATHAN A pin, Mr. Henessey. A surgical pin. 
He scuffs his shoe in the porch dust. Eyes narrowed: 
HENESSEY Where the hell...? I know I just heard that somewhere, something about a... 
His eyes widen: 
HENESSEY Oh, fuck. 
Points to the lake: 
HENESSEY Nathan, that son of a bitch has one in *his* leg. 
Nathan freezes, thoughts racing... swears violently: 
NATHAN You blithering idiot, the son of a bitch wasn't her lover, he was her target, he's Daedalus! 
HENESSEY Oh, Jesus...! That's how she knew all that shit, not from *dating* him -- she *studied* the fucker to take him out! 
He takes off for the lake at a dead run. Behind him, the bloodied Nathan DRAGS himself to his feet and lurches off the porch, stumbling. Weaving. Refusing to go down. 
AT THE LAKESIDE -- Luke walks behind Samantha. Talking softly in her ear, smiling... She hears something. A RATCHETING noise, drawing closer, hmmm...? Looks up. Wishes she hadn't -- A BELL RANGER HELICOPTER is descending over the lake. Inside, TIMOTHY shoulders a bolt action rifle, coolly professional. 
FIRES, kicks up dirt at Henessey's feet. Stops the fucker cold. On the shore, LUKE smiles at Samantha, says: 
LUKE Sure don't look like an ambulance, does it? 
SLUGS HER IN THE FACE. Drops her to the ice like a broken doll. 
CUT TO BLACK: 
Black indeed. Deep. Empty. Out of the darkness, we hear a NEWS COMMENTATOR. Voice scratchy. Indistinct. Far away or long ago... 
A TELEVISION IMAGE fills the screen. Black and white. Grainy. The legend: BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND, over footage of a sidewalk bombing. We're back in time, the year 1971. A crisp- looking BRIGADIER is speaking to the off-camera reporter: 
BRIGADIER ...the bombing has been linked to the Ulster Volunteer Force, which, as you know, is the counterpart of the provisional IRA and the most violent of the Protestant Paramilitary groups. 
An ANNOUNCER's face replaces him: 
ANNOUNCER Despite threats of reprisals, Brigadier Baltimore repeats that he will seek to cut UVF supply lines, especially from Tripoli, Lybia. U.S. President Nixon concurs that... 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
A battered TV, volume turned low. Snoozing in a chair, a rumpled older man -- It's the BRIGADIER, the one we just saw speaking on TV. A CALENDAR on the table identifies the date as June 23, 1971. 
IN THE NEXT ROOM 
Girlish decor. Pinups of rock stars. A YOUNG GIRL is awake, dressed and currently stuffing two pillows under a blanket. She inspects her handiwork. Human-looking lump. Turns, satisfied. 
One last look at the WOODEN JESUS on the wall -- Creeps from the room. Past the sleeping Brigadier. To the front door. She checks over her shoulder, nervous. Taps out five digits. Shuts off the alarm. Unlocks the door and slips out. 
EXT. STREET - BELFAST - NIGHT 
The boy's name is GREGORY. Sixteen, with a quick, easy grin. Huddled beneath a tree with him, the girl is gelatin. 
GREGORY You've never made it with a boy, then? 
GIRL There's nothing odd about it. I'm only sixteen. 
GREGORY Rubbish. 
GIRL What? 
GREGORY You're fourteen and not a day more. Here now, I'm right, you're blushing. 
GIRL Look, what if I'm ignorant? It's my father, we never stay in one place, I never meet bloody anyone. 
GREGORY Saw him on the telly. Think he'd kill me? I'm a nasty one, I am. 
He slides a hand under her sweater. She stiffens, terrified and exhilarated, as he gently strokes her nipple with a thumb. 
GREGORY You know what, I'll bet you've never even kissed a boy... now, have you? (beat) Aye, but you want to... 
He leans in. She leans forward. A jerky, tentative duckling on the road to swan-dom. Their lips touch. 
Across the road, THE WINDOWS BLOW OUT in her father's flat. She spins, scream caught in her throat -- as ARMED MEN rush from the house. Through the door, the one she left unlocked. Stutter of SMALL ARMS FIRE. She whirls on Gregory, realizes only then that the guy is LAUGHING. 
GREGORY Thanks for shutting off the alarm, you bloody Papist bitch. 
He slaps her full across the face. 
GREGORY Tell the press the Ulster Force claims full credit. 
DAEDALUS Talk to me Colonel. Is my identity safe...? The truth, and I'll shoot you in the head. Nice and quick. Otherwise, you're in for a long night. *Who did you talk to*? 
SAMANTHA ...Nobody... fuck you... 
He shakes his head, makes a "tsk tsk" gesture. Smiles grimly as he turns his attention to the red switch. 
DAEDALUS Hate to see you like this, Charly. I heard you were a helluva spy once. 
Without warning, her head snaps upward -- Eyes cold. Voice, not her own: 
SAMANTHA Watch your back. I'm not done yet. 
DAEDALUS That's a very funny joke. You're an entertaining woman. Good night. 
He hits the button. She plunges beneath the surface. Daedalus walks over to one corner. Sits down. Takes out a pipe. Lights it. Picks up a book. Reads. And reads. 
UNDERWATER -- Sam THRASHES and jerks, to and fro. Dead Nathan, mocking her. There, under the water, the memories come... In a flood. Stark and vivid. 
MEMORY FLASH - THE YEAR 
THE TRUNK OF A CAR opens, revealing a patch of night sky. Mostly obscured by two familiar individuals -- 
There's ONE-EYED JACK, remember him? Few years younger. One eyeball heavier. The other man is TIMOTHY. He looks in the trunk. Nods. 
TIMOTHY Okay, I'll signal Daedalus. Your money will be waiting, and Jack...? Do yourself a favor, do her and dump her, I'm serious. Don't get cute, try to play doctor first. I made that mistake. 
The lid SLAMS SHUT. 
BACK UNDER THE WATER 
The world of rushing MADNESS, memories unspooling now, faster and faster -- 
MEMORY FLASH: A CLIFF overlooking the ocean. Darkness. Sheeting rain. Our heroine (for it is unquestionably SAMANTHA) is lying unconscious atop a rocky bluff. Drenched. 
ONE-EYED JACK produces a SYRINGE from a leather case. Rolls up her sleeve. Starts to administer the injection. Stops. He can't resist... Can't help LOOSENING the buttons on her shirt. 
Her eyes snap open. And before it even registers, she's grabbed the hypodermic and plunged it deep INTO HIS EYE -- 
Then she's up and running. Along the cliff, toward the car... Jack, HOWLING in pain, stumbling... Draws his gun and shoots her. In the head. 
She pitches backward. Tumbles from the cliff...! Rushes headlong toward the waters below, getting smaller -- 
INT. BASEMENT OF OLD MILL - THE PRESENT 
Here. Now. She breaks the surface. Gasping for breath. SHRIEKS, a sound ripped from her by the PAIN, the COLD -- 
By her ruptured sanity. She hangs there. Drenched. Half frozen. 
DAEDALUS can't help it. A chill dances up his spine, watching... She is not afraid. She is not whimpering. She is looking directly AT HIM. With a sick smile. 
CHARLY Daedalus... Make you a deal... Let me go now...? I'll leave you the use of your legs... Bargain, trust me... 
Daedalus struggles to recover his poise. 
DAEDALUS How did you find me? Who knows about this place, WHO HAVE YOU TOLD? 
Charly's eyes bore into his: 
CHARLY I let you touch me, cowboy... I think I need a bath. 
Daedalus stabs the red button. THE BIG WHEEL TURNS... Into the water goes Charly. Going down for the third time. 
UNDER THE WATER - HELL - SAME 
Here we are again, in the world of silence and blinding PAIN. Despair and madness but now there's something else -- Now there's RAGE. 
It takes losing most of the FLESH from her right wrist... But she frees the hand. WRENCHES it loose. The water turns soupy red around it. GROPES, blindly. Fingers NUMB, so fucking cold -- Breath, running out. No air. NO TIME. 
She darts her right hand forward. Toward the obscenely bobbing CORPSE of Nathan. Does something grotesque, jams her hand DOWN THE CORPSE'S PANTS -- 
Hideaway gun, it's right where he said, right beside Mr. Wally. PSP-25. Semi-auto, steel jackets. She waits. Rage inside her. Death in her hands. 
MEANWHILE, BACK ON THE SURFACE 
The wheel CREAKS. Groans. The terrorist in the western boots watches her emerge, face first -- She comes up firing. 
The first slug takes him in the knee. Blows it to scraps. He collapses, howling. She shifts aim. THE RED BUTTON. No hesitation. BLAM-! Hits it DEAD ON. Stops the wheel. Incredible. 
Doesn't blink. Unties her captive hand. BLOWS TO SPLINTERS the wood surrounding her feet. Leaps to solid ground, as 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Daedalus looks up from his prone position. In agony. A vision from Hell approaches: A fiendish blue-skinned woman in a sodden nightgown. Blood leaking from one wrist. She has risen, REBORN, from the icy waters. 
DAEDALUS Samantha... Please...! 
CHARLY Who's Samantha? 
She shoots him in the other knee. He HOWLS. Gun, empty. She tosses it aside. In a nearby crate: ASSAULT RIFLES. Snatches up a Kalashnikov and clip. Kneels and says: 
Waking is slow for Mitch Henessey. He swallows dryly. Eyes creak open, struggle to focus... Hears WATER running. A shower. Squints at his watch. He's not wearing a watch, he knew that... In BED, naked. Chest swathed in bandages, what the hell...? He pokes them. Jerks his head, hissing in pain. 
EXT. LIVING ROOM OF SUITE - WITH HENESSEY - NIGHT 
Henessey lights a smoke at the bar. Flicks the match in a trashcan. Starts to go, stops... Reaches into the can. Plucks out a tiny scrap: PHOTOGRAPH, ripped in two. 
A photo of Hal and Caitlin. 
He pockets it, disturbed. Crosses to the bathroom door. The shower has stopped. Raises a tentative hand, starts to knock... It OPENS. There, in a thin silk robe, is a WOMAN, swabbing at her hair. 
She breezes out of the bathroom all chipper, like nothing's unusual. Notices Henessey cursorily. Raises a finger: "one sec." Lowers her head and shakes it like a terrier, spraying him. 
He cannot stop staring. It's Samantha, it *has* to be... 
Now she's BLONDE, though. Hair clipped short. Bobbed. Blood- red fingernails. Red cotton shift, legs for days. 
Then, she *smiles* at him -- and it's not her, not Samantha. 
Amnesia's over, folks, because we're clearly looking at a changed woman: This one's name is CHARLY BALTIMORE, and she hasn't seen the light of day in eight years. 
CHARLY Hey, Mitch. Glad you're awake. Uh- oh, you're seeping. 
She grabs a washcloth. Frowns, says: 
CHARLY Here, look at this. 
With that, she opens her robe and exposes her breasts. Henessey perks up considerably -- then SCREAMS as she RIPS the gauze from his chest. She clinchs the robe again. 
HENESSEY Ah, that hurt like shit!! 
CHARLY That's why I distracted you first. (dabs at his wounds) Same principle as breaking in virgins. 
HENESSEY Same as -- virgins, *what*...? 
CHARLY Saw it in a Harold Robbins book. Guy bites her on the ear as he goes in. Distracts from the pain. You ever try that? 
HENESSEY No, I slug 'em in the jaw and yell "pop goes the weasel," what the fuck are you talking about? Who are you?? 
CHARLY Name's Charly. The spy. Nice to meet'cha. Drink? 
INT. CASINO BAR - EVENING 
Henessey watches, fascinated. All the little mannerisms, the differences. Shaking out a match, running a hand through her hair... And never missing a thing, eyes constantly roving, scanning. Guard never down. She plucks a drink from a nearby table, steals it outright. 
CHARLY See? Sit next to the dance floor, every drink's free. People finish dancing, they think the waiter lifted 'em. 
Henessey grimaces. Clears his throat, says: 
HENESSEY I'm confused. Gimme a minute. 
CHARLY Take two, they're small. 
She knocks back her drink. No hesitation. Henessey shifts uncomfortably, lights a smoke. 
HENESSEY Okay. Let's say I buy it. You're actually a trained killer, Jesus, I can't even say it with a straight face. (frowns) So then... Samantha, she... 
CHARLY Never really existed. Like Nathan said, she was a total fabrication, I made her up. 
HENESSEY Fabrication. And now she's just... gone? Forever and ever? 
CHARLY Thank God. Look at my inordinately large ass, look what she did to me. 
Henessey squirms, this one's gonna take some time to digest. 
HENESSEY Pretty convincing act. 
CHARLY Guess so. 
HENESSEY I mean, her personality, it had to come from *somewhere* -- 
CHARLY Change the subject. Better yet, steal me another drink. 
Henessey sighs. Next to him a couple get up to dance. He reaches over and lifts their beers. 
HENESSEY Drink up. What's next? 
CHARLY I called Chapter. I'm trying to bring us in from the field alive... 
HENESSEY Chapter. Can you trust them? 
CHARLY Not sure. Until I know, you might wanna stay away from curbs. 
He looks at her, confused: 
CHARLY They like to push people in front of buses. 
Didn't need to know that. A DANCING SANTA goes by: 
SANTA CLAUS (bad Caribbean accent) Hey, lady, Santa want to dance the lambada wit'choo. *Come this way, everybody*! 
CHARLY Good morning, Raymond. 
RAYMOND Um... morning, Ms. Caine. 
CHARLY What did we learn about the dangers of smoking...? Give it here. 
A wet stain appears at his crotch. He hands her the cigarette with nerveless fingers. Charly accepts it. Takes a long, satisfying drag. Passes it back. 
CHARLY Thanks. Tell anyone you saw me I'll blow your fucking head off. 
Moves off through the bushes. Out of sight. 
EXT. CAINE BACK YARD - MOMENTS LATER 
Charly kicks aside a pair of abandoned ice skates. Crouches, face pressed to the glass door. Looking in. The house is silent and empty. Nobody home. The Christmas tree winks off and on. The tree she helped decorate. She opens the door and slips inside. CUT TO: 
INT. GOVERNMENT ISSUE SEDAN - DRIVING - SAME TIME 
Three GOVERNMENT AGENTS. Faces drawn, haggard. Pit-stained shirts, day old sandwiches. Carrying photographs of Charly and Henessey. Agent #1 sighs, examining her figure. 
AGENT #1 Man, I'd eat a mile of her shit just to follow it back to the ass it came from. 
AGENT #2 Christ, I'm trying to have breakfast. 
A RADIO MIC on the dash squawks, a voice says: 
VOICE (O.S.) Unit 2 to Red Dog, give us one more pass, let's make sure the house is secure. 
EXT. CAITLIN'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Charly enters. All business. Begins to systematically rifle the drawers. Her daughter's precious things. Sweeps everything onto the floor. Utter disregard, it's a bit startling. 
Crosses to the bed, throws back the covers -- MR. PERKINS (the stuffed bear) has the chain around his neck. 
We hear it, then. Ghosting on the still air, barely audible, the sound of SINGING... Children's voices waft across the frozen pond from St. Paul's Episcopal CHURCH. Charly frowns. Crosses to the window, lifts the sash. 
Pause. Charly chews her lip. Unlimbers the MP-5. Hefts the wicked-looking thing. Not to fire it... but to use the SCOPE. Adjusts focus. Practiced movements. Deft. Sure. Sights down the weapon. Scans though the gunsights... 
POV CHARLY: Hal's CHRISTMAS PAGEANT. There's Hal. Cast in spectral GREEN. Laughing and serving breakfast. On the church lawn, a NATIVITY scene. Teenage girls as the wise men. Choir of children, singing... CAITLIN among them. 
Charly is sweating. She lowers the scope. Squeezes her eyes shut. Something in her, threatening to WRENCH LOOSE... 
EXT. FRONT OF CAINE HOUSE - SAME TIME 
Henessey, slouched behind the wheel. Starts to light a cigarette. Stops, the match halfway to his face. Eyes riveted on the rearview mirror as a GOVERNMENT SEDAN turns the corner behind him... 
BACK WITH CHARLY - INSIDE 
Watching her family, far away. Fighting emotion. That's when she hears A HORN HONKING. Her head whips around, toward the front of the house. The honk is followed by three GUNSHOTS in rapid succession. 
She's up and moving. All else forgotten. 
EXT. FRONT OF CAINE HOUSE - SAME TIME 
Henessey PEELS OUT, tires smoking. Careens forward, government SEDAN close behind -- 
The upstairs window EXPLODES outward. Charly, hurtles through. Freefalls to the porch roof. Glass, showering down. Hits, rolls. Surfaces in a combat crouch, FIRES. 
Government sedan, KILLS THE PASSENGER. Collapses him over the doorframe. Gun clatters to the street, car speeds off -- 
INT. GOVERNMENT SEDAN - DRIVING 
The driver looks over, incredulous. 
DRIVER He's dead. Goddammit, how did that happen?? 
BACKSEAT *Go bulletproof, now*! 
The driver hits a button and up go the windows. All, that is, except the passenger side window -- Because the dead guy's bald HEAD blocks it. Becomes WEDGED there. Bald pate exposed to the world. 
BACK WITH CHARLY - FRONT OF HOUSE 
Charly watches the two vehicles rocketing away down the street. Out of range. Lowers the smoking .45. SWEARS. Takes off around the house at a dead run. 
INT. ST. PAUL'S - SAME TIME 
Switch scenery: the Christmas Pageant, CAITLIN and fellow angels traipse into the church vestibule... Caitlin looks up just in time to see TIMOTHY apply the chloroform. 
Two seconds, she's out like a light. Next case. Up and moving, child tucked neatly under his arm. A NEARBY MOTHER OF THREE has seen it happen. Opens her mouth to scream -- He palms a KNIFE. Puts it to her youngest son's kidney: 
TIMOTHY Wanna be a statistic, lady? You're about to have 2.4 children. 
Freezes her. Petrified. 
TIMOTHY I know where you live. Close your mouth, you look like a fish. Merry Christmas. 
He exits into the vestibule. Quick. Professional. 
MEANWHILE, BACK AT THE RANCH: 
CLOSE ON CHARLY: Dead still. Made of glass. 
TIMOTHY (O.S.) I want money, Charly. I know you've got numbered accounts, we all do. I'll let you know where and when. Fuck with me...? I'll blind the kid and shoot out her knees. 
CHARLY You're dead, motherfucker. We don't involve families. It's not the way it's done, *we don't take families*. 
TIMOTHY I'll be in touch. 
He hangs up. Dead silence. HOLD on Charly's face... until slowly, ever so slowly, the camera pulls back to REVEAL: 
The .45 automatic -- Pointed at the head of an AT&T operator. THE PHONE COMPANY, they've taken it over. Employees CRINGE on the floor. Henessey, MP-5 slung on his shoulder, leveled. Charly points to the switchboard: 
CHARLY Give me an ANI trace. Do it. 
EXT. PINE-COVERED MOUNTIANS - UPSTATE NEW YORK - MORNING 
Set back from the mountain road, a lonely MOTEL. A neon sign: *Deer Lick Motel*, No vacancies. The sign sits atop a rusty pole. Blinks forlornly. 
INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME 
TIMOTHY hangs up and turns to MR. PERKINS, seated across the room: 
TIMOTHY It's done, she hooked. All I gotta do is set the ransom meet. 
PERKINS She mustn't suspect a trap. 
TIMOTHY No way. She thinks I'm acting alone, remember? Say the word, I'll hand her to you on a plate. 
Perkins crosses to the bed. Rubs tired eyes. Gazes down at Caitlin. Asleep, a syringe on the nightstand beside her. Next to a brown paper bag. 
PERKINS God. We're monsters, aren't we...? (pause, then:) Forget Charly. Talk to me about tonight. 
TIMOTHY The tanker's on its way from Charleston, ETA 1:00 a.m. One terrorist on ice, waiting to play patsy. (points) What's in the sack? 
Perkins follows his gaze: the brown paper bag. Smiles thinly. 
PERKINS That...? Something to prove that I'm not a complete ogre. 
He reaches into the paper bag and brings out a BABY DOLL. Sweet, innocent. Frilly with lace. A bright red bow. 
PERKINS See? The young one will have a doll to play with on Christmas. Very popular item. It... well, it pees. You put water in it and... oh, fuck you. 
INT. ROADSIDE RESTAURANT - NEW YORK STATE - TWILIGHT 
Charly and Henessey, eating at HARDEE'S. Seated across from each other at an orange plastic table, scarfing Christmas burgers. Outside, a billboard reads: WELCOME TO SANTA CLAUS! *Where it's Christmas all year long*! 
HENESSEY Almost dark now. 
CHARLY Another ten minutes. You want my Crazy Meal action figure? 
HENESSEY Pass. Listen, you sure we're doing the right thing? We've got money, we could negotiate... 
CHARLY *I'll get the damn kid*, okay? God, I hope he doesn't shoot her up. Kid's dead weight if she's sedated. 
HENESSEY Not so emotional, I'm getting embarrassed with these outbursts here. 
CHARLY Oh, balls. Want me to cry on cue? I can. This is an extraction, nimrod, and she's the target, that's how to play it, the only way to beat this guy. 
HENESSEY Yeah? How come you know so much about this fucking guy? 
CHARLY Don't go there, Mitch, you don't want to know. 
HENESSEY I'm here. Suppose you tell me. 
CHARLY Fine, you asked. I bumped pelvises with this guy. In Paris, back in 
She knows she's shocking him, rubs it in: 
CHARLY I'd been assigned to kill his boss, remember...? Needed him out of the way. So I let him seduce me. Had a steel needle under the pillow, figured to stick him *en flagrante*, that means while we were screwing. But he was too slick. Bashed me in the head, finished, then threw me in the trunk of a car. Still think I'm a girl scout, Mitch...? 
The look in her eyes is feral. 
CHARLY It's almost dark. Let's get it done. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHTTIME 
Full dark now, the fun begins... A TANKER TRUCK rumbles up the mountain road. Pulls up before the Deer Lick Motel. MEN IN SUITS wield flashlights, motioning the truck forward into a cavernous GARAGE. Inside, men in BLUE JUMPSUITS operate cranes, maneuver a FILL TANK into place above the truck. 
EXT. SURROUNDING MOUNTAINSIDE - SAME TIME 
In the distance, as the tanker enters the garage -- CHARLY BALTIMORE drops into frame. Lands and rolls, cat-quick. Comes up behind a scrawny pine. Scans through a pair of Zeiss Nightvision binoculars. 
Welcome to the extraction. No more fun and games, tonight it's a survival-zero operation. HENESSEY appears at her elbow. Lugging the ordnance bag. He sees Charly lower the binoculars, head in hands. 
HENESSEY What's the matter? 
CHARLY They're here. 
HENESSEY Who? 
Henessey watches, helpless and PANICKED, as Charly tumbles BACKWARD. Crashes through a CELLAR ACCESS, it splinters beneath her...! Plunges into blackness. 
INT. CELLAR - PITCH BLACK 
She hits, cushions the kid. Grunt of PAIN... THE DARKNESS EXPLODES into kaleidoscopic FLASHES OF GUNFIRE, Charly strafe it all. Blows through the clip, hits the lights: 
She's killed household items. BRICK WALLS, blasted. Rusty tools, faded signs -- THREE TEN-GALLON GAS CANS which she's managed to PERFORATE, good one, Charly... The gas comes bubbling out on burps and splatters, drenching the floor. 
Charly casts about for an escape route. Set into the brick wall, a huge steel DOOR. She flings it open -- MEAT LOCKER. Nothing there, no help. Eyes darting. Possessed. 
A GRAVELY VOICE wafts down from above, then. Deadly serious: 
VOICE (O.S.) I smell gasoline, you have a little accident...? I got plenty of matches up here. Bad way for a kid to go. Thirty seconds, think it over. 
CHARLY stands in place, mind racing... Caitlin's DOLL. Regards her dully. Plastic smile like it knows a secret. CUT TO: 
INT. MOTEL - 2ND FLOOR - NIGHTTIME 
A MATCH FLARES as it descends into the bowl of a pipe... MR. PERKINS puffs mightily. Turns and favors CHARLY and HENESSEY with a thoughtful gaze, they're handcuffed to radiator... TIMOTHY straddles a nearby chair. Smiles and says: 
TIMOTHY Good to have you back again, Chuck. 
PERKINS You know, Colonel, you ought really to have stayed dead. You don't know the rules of the game anymore. 
CHARLY No shit. Eight years ago, you send me to kill Daedalus and this clown. Now you're working *with* him. 
He crosses to the fireplace, flips the match inside. 
PERKINS Budget cuts, remember? Congress blinded us in Eastern Europe, Central America. Across the board, an intelligence blackout. We had to recruit any eyes and ears we could find, even if it meant going to former targets. 
Pause. Suddenly Charly's eyes go wide. She whispers: 
CHARLY Budget cuts... oh, God. Is *that* what this is about...? The foot soldiers, the tanker truck... Fuck me, you're running a fundraiser!! 
Comprehension, dawning. She looks up in disbelief. 
CHARLY You'll get all the money you want at the next budget hearing, won't you...? All you need is a major terrorist incident. 
PERKINS Interesting theory. 
CHARLY Theory, my ass. I think some terrorists were planning a strike. Bought supplies from Daedalus, that's how you knew they were coming... (eyes widening) No way. Don't tell me you're gonna sit there and let them go through with it, *just to get a budget increase*. 
Perkins shrugs philosophically. 
PERKINS It's not without precedent. 1993, remember the World Trade Center bombing...? The CIA had advance knowledge, don't think they didn't. Worse, the diplomat who issued the terrorist's visa was CIA, they *facilitated* the bombing. Purely to justify a budget increase. Of course, they'd no way of knowing the terrorists would botch the job. 
CHARLY That's not gonna happen this time...? 
PERKINS No. This time, the terrorist event will come off precisely as planned. This time the terrorists can't muck it up... because we've killed them and taken over. 
Charly and Henessey react, startled... 
EXT. MOTEL GROUNDS - NIGHTTIME 
On the move. Our two heroes, shepherded across the compound. Timothy's casualness is belied by the presence of two dyspeptic GUARDS, each keeping a safe distance. 
A POCK-FACED AGENT approaches briskly, RIFLE across his shoulder. Holds out his hand: 
POCK Found these buried around the perimeter. 
Timothy studies it: C-4 CHARGE with remote detonation unit. 
TIMOTHY Make sure you get all of them. 
The agent rushes off. Timothy looks at Charly reproachfully: 
TIMOTHY Chuck, you give me the fuck of my life then try to stick me, come back from the dead, whack my boss... No sense lyin', I'm miffed. 
Moves like lightning. WHACK-! Kidney shot. Charly stumbles, vision going black. Fights for balance. Henessey starts to react but a GUN MUZZLE stops him. Charly straightens. Grits her teeth, says: 
CHARLY So what's the plan? What's going out in the tanker? 
Timothy and the guards exchange looks. Cracking up, they can't believe it -- Charly's not laughing. Looks at Timothy with hooded, lifeless eyes: 
CHARLY What's the plan? I'm gonna die, I wanna know. 
Timothy lights a cigarette. Studies Charly. 
TIMOTHY You wanna know the plan? 
He casually points to the neighboring valley, where Christmas lights twinkle. 
TIMOTHY Santa Claus -- small town U.S.A. personified. We drive the chemical tanker in tonight, park it. Add a catalyst, chain reaction, it goes hot. We evacuate. The mix heats overnight, goes critical at 312 degrees Celsius. 8:00 Christmas morning... Main Street looks like a meteor strike. 
HENESSEY Are you fucking insane? You're talking about 10,000 people!! 
CHARLY Easy, Mitch. (to Timothy) How you gonna blame it on terrorists? 
TIMOTHY Those roads are treacherous this time of year. When we dump a car to the bottom of a ravine, with the corpse of Imn Al Rahman in it... get the picture? 
Henessey, by the window. Tied to a chair. Timothy paces before him, carrying three razor-keen SCALPELS. Pegs one into the wall with deadly accuracy. 
TIMOTHY Tell me where Charly keeps her money. She must have mentioned it. 
HENESSEY Get fucked, you dumb bastard. Charly called Washington, by morning this whole place'll be crawling with Feds. 
TIMOTHY We'll be gone by then, Mitch. 
HENESSEY Yeah, well, that's what I'm saying, there's a couple Feds, they couldn't sleep, said they might come early. Fuck you, someone'll screw up. Just watch. 
TIMOTHY Already did, Mitch, someone already did. Perkins got stuck with a double agent, someone trusted, highly placed. 
HENESSEY Who? 
TIMOTHY Me. (chuckles) Chinks are paying me to bring down Chapter. 
Henessey reacts, startled. Timothy chuckles: 
TIMOTHY Truck goes, hundreds dead -- rescue teams within minutes, guess what they find...? 
HENESSEY The patsy. 
TIMOTHY Uh-uh. They find Chapter, caught with their pants down. See, Mitch, I dumped in a much faster chemical catalyst... (beat) The tanker's gonna blow *tonight*. In the center of town, thirty-five minutes from now. 
INT. CELLAR MEAT LOCKER - SAME TIME 
CHARLY, sweating at sub zero. Brushes hair from her eyes. Blinks. Still jabbing with the knife, *why the hell is she digging*? Gonna crawl under the damn door? She's gone loopy. Lying flat, she appraises her work -- 
A TINY NOTCH. Poked through to the other side. The actual penetration to daylight: millimeters. Then, she does two seemingly nonsensical things: Crosses to Caitlin -- gently takes the doll from her, then: 
CHARLY Open. 
Reaches in her mouth. Takes out her RETAINER. 
Must be the temperature. Crosses to the door again. Kneels down. Calmly, with infinite care, takes the retainer... 
Inverts it, now it's *trough*-shaped. Holds it flush against the tiny NOTCH she carved. BABY DOLL, now. Holds it directly above the retainer. Depresses the KNOB in its back: 
It pees gasoline. Gas, trickling down the retainer, through the brick -- into the other ROOM. 
Not much. Enough. She stands. DRAWS A TRAIL with the doll. Crosses, dribbling, over to Caitlin. Hands the doll back to her. What next..? 
She grabs the hunting knife, that's what. RAISES IT HIGH -- One terrifying moment, is she gonna put it in the kid...? Hardly. Brings it down on the floor. Slams it down. 
CHARLY Gimme a spark... show me, show me... 
Tries again. And again. STRIKING, over and over. Floor RINGS with the effort -- 
CHARLY Come on, come on... do it...! 
But in the end, it's just not gonna happen. *Won't work*. Lets go a GROAN of despair: 
CHARLY All this, just one fucking match, *Goddamit*...! 
She collapses forward. Cradles her head in frustration. There's a tiny tap in her shoulder. 
CAITLIN Mommy...? 
Charly looks up, face haggard and depleted... Caitlin's eyes, alive again. No longer dulled. Kid reaches inside her CAST and brings out a pack of matches. 
CAITLIN Don't cry. I keep these here. (beat) For lighting your candle. 
Charly stares, dumbstruck, at the tiny gift. 
The bitterness, the self-hatred, all of it. Under innocent eyes on Christmas Eve DETONATES, blown sky-high, and she sweeps up her daughter and cradles her, tears streaming... 
CHARLY I love you, Caitlin, oh God, do you know how much I love you...? 
Caitlin pulls back, looks flush in her mother's face. 
CAITLIN Am I gonna die...? 
From a dark and cold place, Caitlin has led her home. Charly's eyes, like steel. A harsh whisper: 
CHARLY No, baby, you're not gonna die. They are. 
She strikes a match. 
INT. SECOND STORY INTERROGATION ROOM - SAME TIME 
Henessey, straining against his bonds. Sweating. 
TIMOTHY Charly's stash. What's the number of the locker, Mitch...? 
HENESSEY Fuck you. 
TIMOTHY across the room, a good forty feet. 
TIMOTHY Left nut, five bucks I make it. 
HENESSEY Behind the big garage. Is Caitlin with you? 
CHARLY No, but she's safe for the moment, she stowed away on the tanker truck. 
Henessey draws a sharp breath. Swallows, says: 
HENESSEY Charly, Timothy rigged the tanker to go off early. We got fifteen minutes. No more. 
On her reaction we CUT TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROADSIDE - WITH TANKER AND EN TOURAGE 
Beside the tanker, A PANEL TRUCK sits, engine idling. Phony logo on its side -- *Little Debbie* snack cakes. A RAMP is lowered, and a CAR begins backing up into the truckbed, facing outwards. 
INSIDE THE TRUCKBED, harried blue-suits hurriedly unwrap the frost-covered corpse of IMN AL RAHMAN -- and place him behind the wheel. 
MEANWHILE, AT THE BACK OF THE TANKER 
A blue-suit puts a PADLOCK on the utility box as he passes. SNAPS IT SHUT. 
BACK WITH HENESSEY - SAME TIME 
He hears two flat CRACK-!s on the still air. 
HENESSEY Hello...! Charly...? 
Even over the receiver, her desperation's apparent: 
CHARLY Tires won't pop, Mitch. Bastard just locked her in, she's stuck in there and they're leaving, *Goddammit*! 
Henessey rubs his eyes. Takes several deeps breaths, mind turning it over. He looks up. Tired. Haunted. 
HENESSEY All right, I'll go in and get her, you watch my back. 
CHARLY No chance. I make it twelve, Mitch, automatic weapons. 
HENESSEY So kill 'em for me, bitch, Christ, what are you good for? 
He stuffs a fresh clip in the gun. Wipes away sweat. 
HENESSEY (to himself) C'mon, buddy. Do one thing right, just this once... please... 
Closes his eyes. Gathers himself. Long pause... 
HENESSEY Piece of cake. 
He leaps from the roof and makes a death run. 
Gun in one hand, radio in the other. Swerving and dodging like a broken-field runner, CHARLY in his ear screaming: 
CHARLY (V.O.) *Your nine, on your nine*! 
He spins, BLASTS AWAY, dead guy, pitching forward -- SMOKE, billowing, making him COUGH... 
CHARLY (V.O.) *30 degrees left, Mitch. Left*. (beat) *Your other left*. 
Stumbling, catching himself. Barreling forward. 
CHARLY (V.O.) *Nix, nix, I can't see in there, don't do it, break right...*! 
He breaks right. 
CHARLY (V.O.) *Fuck me, I was wrong, get outta threre*! 
He staggers out of the smoke: TWO MEN, MP-5 machine guns. Trained on his chest. He struggles to aim, oh, shit -- Two distant CRACKS. The bad men go away, catapulted backwards. Henessey shouts into the radio: 
HENESSEY Gracias. 
CHARLY (V.O.) *De nada*. 
UP ABOVE, ON THE HILL 
CHARLY fires shot after shot. Every time she squeezes the trigger, someone dies. No such thing as wounded, we're talking St. Peter looks up from a magazine and says holy shit, it's the lunch rush at Kate Mantilini's. 
BACK DOWN BELOW 
The smoke clears and Mitch sees the tanker. Right there, thirty yards away. Yellow UTILITY BOX. No one in the way. 
CHARLY (V.O.) *End run, Mitch, go wide*! 
He breaks for the truck. 
CHARLY (V.O.) *No, Goddamn you, they got you flanked...*! 
Everybody fires a gun. 
MITCH GETS HIT 
Takes one high in the chest, SPINS him...! 
UP ABOVE - CLIFF'S EDGE 
The Jaguar goes up with a solid CRUMP--! Blown off the edge of the cliff. Along with a half dozen screaming AGENTS. 
BACK WITH CHARLY - FALLING 
Lifeline cut. 60 feet above the road, no problem. She does thirty feet in freefall. Raises her left hand -- 
Slaps a carabiner on a passing POWER LINE. Hurtles downward until suddenly, KA-CHUK--! She LURCHES to a stop. 
Doesn't miss a beat: Grips a rope and GLIDES the last thirty feet, touches down lightly. Unhooks herself, turns as AN ONCOMING CAR throws a fishtail SKID, just misses her. Driver SWEARS. 
She raises her gun. Fires without blinking. 
Puts a hole in the passenger side windshield and the DRIVER ain't sticking around, he's out the door and gone as 
CHARLY THE EXTERMINATOR 
Crosses to the car, face a stone mask. Behind her the FLAMING JAGUAR SMASHES to the ground, raining fragments -- Followed by BURNING CORPSES, smacking the pavement one after another. She doesn't even look. Gets behind the wheel. Leaves most of her tires on the road behind her. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - TOWN OF SANTA CLAUS - CHRISTMAS EVE 
Milling crowds. Music and laughter. SANTA heads up a TEEMING PARADE down Main Street, atop a horse-drawn sleigh... Replay of the film's opening, as 
EXT. STREET - SAME TIME 
The gleaming TANKER roars down a sidestreet. Riding point: the innocuous PANEL TRUCK. 
The temperature gauge continues to RISE: *203 degrees*. 
EXT. MAIN STREET - EDGE OF TOWN - SAME TIME 
Charly runs a roadblock, doing fifty -- Someone put a PARADE in front of her. Hits the BRAKES...! Fishtales into a mailbox. Sends it flying through a plate glass window. Out of the car, gun held low, and meanwhile -- 
INT. CAR - DRIVING 
TIMOTHY barks orders into a mic: 
TIMOTHY All units converge. Divert local law, this is a government matter. Brook no interference, I want the Baltimore woman eliminated. *Where's the fucking chopper*? 
Racing toward the edge of town and meanwhile 
ON THE PARADE ROUTE 
SANTA CLAUS himself perches atop his sleigh, feeling like a rock star and wishing his groupies were legal... when suddenly he's got company. 
CHARLY I'm the Missus. Drive. 
The rogue colonel FIRES A SHOT in the air -- THE HORSES bolt. Plunging off the parade route amid SCREAMS as 
INT. PLUSH LIMO - SAME TIME 
MR. PERKINS hunkers forward, face slack, as a tinny VOICE issues from his headset mic: 
VOICE (O.S.) ...yes, she's with Santa Claus, correct, er, excuse me, the individual *playing* Santa, er... they're pursuing the tanker truck, sir. 
Perkins stares straight ahead, speechless. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - HEADING OUT OF TOWN 
SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE TANKER. Horses at full gallop, hooves in pounding frenzy. Charly tries to JUMP from one to the other -- no go, the tanker pulls away, widening the distance, and meanwhile 
TWO GOVERNMENT SEDANS 
Come whipping out of ALLEYS, fall in behind them. CRACK--! Gunshots, shattering the stillness. 
EXT. TRUCK CHASSIS - SAME TIME 
A RICOCHET whines off a hydraulic cable. Spurt of fluid as the BRAKES start to go, and meanwhile 
BACK ON THE SLEIGH 
CHARLY throws herself flat next to Santa. 
CHARLY Sorry, man. Government agents, high level conspiracy. 
SANTA Fuckin' government. 
The SEDANS jockey for position, try to pull ABREAST -- Charly swerves the sleigh back and forth, won't let them through. She hands the reigns to Santa. 
CHARLY Veer left. 
SANTA Away from the truck? 
CHARLY Do it. In five seconds I'm gonna own that fucking truck. 
Santa complies. PEELS OFF to the left -- Opens a TWELVE FOOT chasm between sleigh and tanker. Sure enough, one of the government cars spurts forward to fill the gap, comes ABREAST of them. It's what she wanted. 
*FIVE SECONDS*: 
Charly flies back. Hits and SLIDES. Fetches up against a bannister, WHAM--! Timothy calmly shuts the door behind him. Consults his tiny gauge -- *297 degrees*. 
TIMOTHY Call it four minutes to detonation. I got a chopper on the way, lots of time. 
He sheds his coat. Stows his gun. Removes a SWITCHBLADE. Drapes the coat on the bannister. Flicks open the knife. 
CHARLY Oh, honey. Only four inches...? 
TIMOTHY You'll feel me. 
He approaches, almost casually. Charly staggers erect. Adopts a killing stance. Instinct. She can barely stand. 
INT. PERKINS' LIMOUSINE - SAME TIME 
PERKINS hears a garbled, pained voice over his headset: 
VOICE (O.S.) Point team leader, reporting... She's... incapacitated the truck... I'm damaged, sir, I believe I'm dying... Instructions...? 
PERKINS Continue dying. Out. 
He leans back. Stares sightlessly. Loosens his tie, hits the intercom and says: 
PERKINS Anthony, get me the President... 
He takes out a bottle of Scotch. CUT TO: 
INT. CHAPEL - SAME TIME 
Charly and Timothy. They circle, two pros. 
TIMOTHY You've lost a step, Chuck. Muscles never recovered from C-section, I'll bet. Am I right? 
Never watching the eyes, the eyes are liars, they watch the HANDS... The gathered saints look on, neutral. 
CHARLY Please, man... She's only... eight... she's a beautiful little girl... 
His concentration never falters as he says: 
TIMOTHY She's a worthless bitch. I know it 'cause she came out of me. 
He LUNGES with the knife, she spins away -- He gets hold of one arm and FLINGS her, up and over...! She SAILS through space. Twists in mid-air. Lands like a cat. Almost. Staggers forward. They circle... 
TIMOTHY It's called shock, Charly... Your body wants to go into shock... 
CHARLY Fuck you, your breathing's lousy... 
Charly LAUNCHES herself. Avoids a stab at her throat, eats that for breakfast, spins, slams the knuckles of her right hand into Timothy's ribs. Busts one. He snarls, TRAPS her wrist: CRACK! Wrist, broken. She HISSES in pain, falls back GASPING. 
Circling again. Charly cannot walk a straight line. 
TIMOTHY Look at you. You're out of your motherfucking league, dearie. 
CLOSE ON CHARLY 
She looks up at him from sunken eyes shot through with red, and in those eyes we glimpse it; the DEMON, laughing... as Charly whispers: 
CHARLY ...You want a piece...? Take my shoulder. 
He lunges with the knife...! She ducks, trips on purpose and HANDS HIM HER SHOULDER, all that's missing is the plate -- 
And WHAM. In goes the knife, cuts deep and Charly looks him in the eye and GRINS because sure enough, there's the bastard's KNEE, wide open... 
Boot-strikes, BAM--! Shears the knee, and Timothy HOWLS in agony. Stumbles backward into the bannister -- 
Grabs his coat. Brings out the gun, it GOES OFF--! 
Charly dives for cover. Rips the knife from her own shoulder and flings it. 
Takes him in the shoulder. Topples him back. BANNISTER. Up and over, flailing...! Drops from sight. 
Charly falls back. Pause. Sucking air. Sits down hard. Legs splayed. Looks down at herself, oh, God... 
There's a hole in her chest. 
EXT. SEMINARY - NIGHTTIME 
The doors burst open and here she comes. Trauma, severe. Shock, blood loss -- She makes for the tanker. For her kid. Hitches. Staggers. Going on sheer guts. 
THE HELICOPTER ROARS OVERHEAD 
The PILOT brandishes his radio mic: 
PILOT Got her. Heading for the tanker, thirty yards out. She's all over the place, something's wrong with her. 
WITH CHARLY 
Left foot, right foot, she's not running, she's falling in a straight line -- Reaches the tanker. Staggers against the inverted chassis. UTILITY BOX. Above her. 
CHARLY *Cover your ears*. 
CHARLY Distract him, for God's sake give me ten seconds, please, I'm begging somebody, anybody, *she's my daughter*...! 
EXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT 
A sour-looking CHAPTER AGENT stands before a row of cars and the Little Debbie panel truck. Expressionless beaurocrat. Lifts the mic to his lips and says: 
CHAPTER BEAUROCRAT Negative, ma'am, we understand your request, but we've decided to go ahead and let this play out... 
Behind him, the back of the panel truck EXPLODES. A car CATAPULTS outward into space -- SMASHES DOWN atop two sedans. Blows out their windshields. Flings itself to the pavement and RICOCHETS forward, zero to sixty. 
MITCH HENESSEY 
At the wheel. Making a suicide run. Face a FRIGHT MASK of deadly purpose. We have no idea why someone who looks like him is alive. 
INT. HELICOPTER - SAME TIME 
*Distraction*, just enough: The pilot banks toward the CAR. 
TIMOTHY Where are *you* going?? 
Timothy grabs the stick -- THAT'S WHEN CHARLY BREAKS COVER. Does a MAD STAGGER across the blacktop. Goes for the GUN. 
TIMOTHY CHANGES DIRECTION. Chopper again, SCREAMING in low and fast -- 
CHARLY dives, rolls -- Comes up with the MACHINE GUN and falls flat on her back, points it skyward: 
CHARLY Suck on it. 
She fires. Blows the chopper's TAIL ROTOR. The craft pitches to the side -- Dumps Timothy out the door. Flailing. 
Head over heels, he FALLS -- Lands atop the TANKER, right on the silver tank and *burns*. Actually SIZZLES at 310 degrees Celsius, steam pouring off him like a vampire in daylight, SHRIEKING--! 
CHARLY Die screaming, motherfucker. 
She watches as he slips from sight... off the tanker. SIRENS now, approaching. Wind, biting cold. Ground black and bloody in the moonlight... 
HERE COMES HENESSEY, powers across the lot, pedal to the metal. Followed at a distance of fifty yards by half a dozen squawling GOVERNMENT VEHICLES, flashers turning. 
Henessey stomps the brake. SLEWS to a stop, tires cooking...! KICKS open the passenger door as Charly collapses into the car, CAITLIN in her arms. The kid says: 
CAITLIN Hurry! The truck is a bomb! 
HENESSEY Yeah, yeah. What else, we got a fucking lightning rod on the roof...? No, Caitlin, *don't check*. 
He PEELS OUT. 
CHARLY Hey... you're bleeding... 
HENESSEY I think that's yours... 
CHARLY Right, sorry... 
He inadvertently smacks a light pole. SPARKS fly. 
CAITLIN *You're a bad driver! Who said you could drive*? 
EXT. PARKING LOT - BESIDE THE TANKER - SAME TIME 
They have to drag Timothy inside the car. The engine ROARS as it leaps forward, trailing the other FIVE -- Scarred and hideous, he stares after Charly, screaming: 
TIMOTHY *Somebody do her, somebody kill that fucking whore, kill her*! 
That's when the helicopter crashes. The pilot does everything but flap his arms -- Forget it. IT KEELS OVER. Rotor touches pavement -- Blows to pieces. They ALL go. Snapped off. Blown like rockets in every direction. 
TIMOTHY LOOKS UP as a rotor blade whistles right through the windshield of his car. Shears off his HEAD. Blows out the BACK in a shower of glass and hurtles onward, SPINNING out of control... 
Strikes the tanker. Boom. 
Imagine God in Monte Carlo. Tossing dice the length of a craps table. Now, imagine the dice are BURNING CARS. 
EXT. EDGE OF PARKING LOT - SAME TIME 
Henessey flies out of the parking lot and INTO the WOODS as the firestorm RAGES TO HEAVEN behind him. Cars, heading his way -- AIRBORNE. Fights the wheel, swerving through the woods as all around him, FLAMING CARS crash down. BOUNCING into and out of the trees, peekaboo... 
Some go flying past OVERHEAD. Striking in front like meteors, GOUGING the earth. Caitlin screams: 
CAITLIN Don't hit the cars! 
Henessey favors her with a foul look. CHARLY looks up and sees ANGELS flying overhead, trailing concrete... 
Then they're OUT OF THE WOODS. Car slingshots onto the highway and races forward, SAFE. Behind it, the sky is aglow, SNOWING fiery traces... Bits of earth, trees, pavement. 
OVERHEAD VIEW: As they roar out of town, we see burning woods and a CRATER approximately 150 yards in diameter -- St. Peter's Seminary no longer exists... CUT TO: 
EXT. ROADSIDE - OUTSIDE OF TOWN - NIGHTTIME 
Henessey coasts to the side of the road and stops. He lays his head on the steering wheel, sucking air. Looks at Charly: 
HENESSEY Sorry, can't drive... Are you okay...?

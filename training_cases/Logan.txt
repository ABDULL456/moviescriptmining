FINAL SHOOTING DRAFT - August 23, 2016 
AN LCD BILLBOARD WITH DEFECTIVE PIXELS 
A BEAUTIFUL COUPLE dance on a giant can of a Red-Bull-like drink-- HYPNO! The label morphs to different flavors. 
EXT. A VACANT LOT -- NIGHT 
Colored light from the billboard flickers over a bullet riddled sign: ROUTE 85. U.S. BORDER, EL PASO, TEXAS. 
Beneath the sign is a LONG BLACK LIMOUSINE. 
Cars whip past on the highway. Then A VAN passes, blasting some future version of Techno Latino Hip Hop. A SQUEAL OF TIRES OS. Now the music gets louder as the van returns, cruising slowly past the black limo before pulling into the lot. Five Bangers bail out and check out the black stretch. 
The limo doors are locked, windows tinted, so they can't see what's inside, but they check out the tires and wheels and like what they see. With the speed of a pit crew, they open the back of the van and out come TOOLS AND A JACK. 
INT. LIMO -- SAME 
We move over the back bench, past empty bottles, fast food wrappers as A SLEEPING MAN'S FACE ratchets into frame. He opens his red eyes. 
The man is LOGAN aka The Wolverine or more accurately, Drunk Wolverine. He blinks, dazed, feeling the car lurching upward. Older than we've seen him, he clutches a Tequila bottle. 
EXT. LIMO -- EL PASO HIGHWAY TURNOUT - NIGHT 
As the back door opens, the tequila bottle drops to the dirt and A BOOTED LEG STEPS OUT. 
Logan shuffles, stiff, to the other side of the stretch where the Bangers work, removing wheels, lit by colored light. 
LOGAN ...Uh. Please stop, guys. Those,.. those are chrome plated lugs. 
They all five turn. Some pull guns on the drunk limo driver. He just keeps talking, slurring some... 
LOGAN (CONT'D) you're gonna strip `em. Plating flakes off, you know... 
A Jittery Banger cocks his shotgun. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  2. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) It's a lease, you know, and no one wants to pay to ride in a-- 
-- THE JITTERY BANGER FIRES. Blows Logan right off his feet. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Fuck. 
Now might be a good time to talk about "fights" described in the next 100 or so pages. Basically, if you're on the make for a hyper choreographed, gravity defying, city-block destroying, CG fuckathon, this ain't your movie. 
In this flick, people will get hurt or killed when shit falls on them. They will get just as hurt or just as killed if they get hit with something big and heavy like, say, a car. Should anyone in our story have the misfortune to fall off a roof or out a window, they won't bounce. They will die. 
As for our hero with his so-called eternal life and healing. Well, he's older now. If you keep reading, you'll discover Logan's about to get his ass kicked. But before we get to that, we should make it clear his abilities ain't what they were. Yes, he's a drunk, but he's also fading on the inside. Adamantium implants leeching into his system, causing chronic pain and diminished healing, hence booze as painkiller. 
So by all means, go ahead and worry about him. Now where were we? Oh, yeah-- 
As the smoke settles, a CROWBAR-toting Banger angrily chews out Jitters in Spanish for firing. The others resume their work... none aware of Logan slowly getting up, till -- 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Guys... seriously... (gets to his feet) You don't wanna do this. 
The Bangers react to Logan with bafflement. Ad-lib Spanish reactions, nervous chuckles -- 
CROWBAR presses down JITTER'S gun as he moves to Logan. 
We hear a familiar SNIKT! as claws slowly extend from one of Logan's hands, then mostly extend from the other. Logan is still frowning at his bad hand when-- 
CROWBAR THWACKS HIS SKULL. A metallic ring. 
Off balance and pissed, Logan swings at them as they converge, but he's drunk and soon they are pounding him with knives and guns and fists and a torque wrench. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                    3. 
He tries his best to keep them from the limo, catches one guy's bat an inch before it would dent the car. 
Another one of them shoots in that direction, but Logan puts himself in front of the bullet. The pain from that little move stops him long enough for them to resume the pummeling. 
Suddenly, Logan's eyes go yellow, pupils dilating. He lets out a long, loud yell. Fury rockets up in him, like cocaine. 
HE STANDS AND RAMS HIS CLAWS INTO CROWBAR and kicks another Banger into the back of the open van. Yet another runs at Logan only to get gored in the neck and tossed. This is real work for Logan, not easy. And it is fueled by rage. 
Jitters again raises his sawed-off, he will nail the car for sure, but Logan slices off his arm above the elbow. 
Sadly for Logan, the hand, while disconnected from the body it once belonged to, is still holding the gun. So, as it hits the dirt, the gun goes off, putting several pellet-sized holes in the door of the limo. 
This, more than anything else, doubles Logan anger-- 
LOGAN (CONT'D) MOTHERF-- 
WHO GETS HIT ONCE MORE --and then goes after the last banger who, seeing he had his chance, leaps into the van and spins out of the lot, his wounded compadre in back, spilling onto the dirt as the van bounces back onto the road. 
Logan picks up his keys, some loose change and a single silver bullet. He stands, staring at the holes in his otherwise pristine stretch as RAIN BEGINS TO FALL. 
He sucks in deep breaths, forcing himself to regain control. His eyes return to normalcy. A PHONE VIBRATES OS. Logan takes out his, looks at it (he's got a fare), kicks the jack from the under the chassis. 
WE CRANE UP as Logan starts up the stretch and makes a loop in the lot, taking care to run over the three remaining Bangers before laying rubber onto the highway... 
WIDE AS-- Logan pulls his stretch into a spot at A HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE. He hurries through the rain, meeting A LARGE MAN IN ORDERLY SCRUBS, smoking a vape under a canopy. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                    7. 
The two talk for a moment, Logan hands the man cash and the man toys with handing Logan a bag, pulls it away, demanding more money. They argue. 
REVERSE TO REVEAL-- A MAN IN A JEEP, WATCHING through the rain, HIS METAL HAND ON THE WHEEL. 
INT. LOGAN'S LIMO -- OUTSIDE HOSPITAL -- MOMENTS LATER 
Logan, now carrying the bag, hurries through the rain to his Limo. He climbs inside starts it up but is startled by the back door opening and closing. Logan spins to face -- 
A SMILING MAN in the back of his stretch. This is Donald Pierce, 35. A southern boy, smooth and playful. 
PIERCE As I live and breathe. The Wolverine. And he's a junkie now. 
LOGAN Who the fuck are you? 
PIERCE Y'know, you got some buckshot in your door. (plays with the liquor bottles in back) I heard you were in Phoenix. Food's better there by the way. But then, last night, some friends in Texas H-P called, told me they found three dead cholos in a pullout out on 54. Not unusual, except one was missing a hand. Another a leg. Multiple parallel lacerations. Slashes, femoral, thoracic. So, they're thinking it was either an escaped Tiger or Freddy Krueger... but neither of those can drive, one being fictional the other extinct. And since the wheel lugs they found belong to a `24 Gauntlet-- 
LOGAN Get out. Now. 
PIERCE Has she found you yet? ...Gabriela? (off Logan's blank look) See, I'm not looking for you, mutey. Not really. I'm looking for someone who's looking for you. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 8. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) (THEN) She took something of mine. Something for which I am responsible. When I wasn't looking. Mexican lady. Long hair, long legs, Long gone. Has her sights on you. (off Logan's glare) No bells? 
LOGAN I don't know any Gabriela. So get the fuck out. 
Pierce just smiles, unfazed, then shifts his gaze to Logan's bag of pills. Peering in, quasi-conspiratorial: 
PIERCE I know what you're hiding, amigo. Cue ball south of the border? 
Logan tenses, says nothing. 
LOGAN What do you want? 
PIERCE A little ...cooperation. 
Flicks a business card. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) If she does find you. 
Then Pierce exits. Crosses in the rain to a Custom Ram Truck, Logan looks to the card: 
DONALD PIERCE -- CHIEF OF SECURITY TRANSIGEN RESEARCH, A DIVISION OF ALKALI 
EXT. CORDOVA BRIDGE - BORDER - MORNING 
A HUGE FUCKING WALL. "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING THE UNITED STATES" says the sign mounted on top of it. Brown muted light pushes through the haze over the factories on the Mexican side. 
An agitated Logan in border traffic, talking on his phone as he eyes the CAMERAS watching him: 
LOGAN Mr. Espiranza, yes, I know I said June, but I want the boat now. Yes. Why does that mean the price go up? (FRUSTRATED) (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                    9. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Yes, I know you wanted seventy, but I am telling you I have 45 cash now. Just bring it to port in Baja. 
The seller HANGS UP. Logan sighs. Logan squints at the Penny Saver on his seat, a listing for a Sunseeker circled when a CAR HORN blares. Logan inches forward moving past-- 
A semi pulling A LIVESTOCK TRAILER loaded with sad looking horses. EL RIO MEATS painted on the side. 
A BORDER AGENT nods cheerfully at Logan, recognizing him. Waves him on. And that's when we see -- 
THE WOMAN FROM THE CEMETERY (GABRIELA) WATCHING HIM FROM BEHIND THE WHEEL OF HER FIAT. At a distance. She considers following him, then swings her car around. 
EXT. CIUDAD JUAREZ - HIGHWAY 45 -- MORNING 
Logan drives through littered Mexican streets. Cinderblock structures pocked with bullet holes, metal shutters pulled. 
He merges onto Highway 45, heading for the desert. 
EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - DAY 
A vista of dirt, bisected by train tracks and fence. Logan slows as he approaches A GATE. Beyond the gate, AN ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT. Logan exits, pulls keys, unlocks the gate. 
A CART WITH A PROPANE TANK STOPS as the limo comes up the road. Camera reveals the cart is pushed by A TALL MAN in a wide hat, sunglasses and gloves. He wipes his ghost-pale brow. This is CALIBAN, an albino mutant in his 60's with more than a passing resemblance to Edvard Munch's THE SCREAM. 
INT. SMELTING PLANT -- "KITCHEN" - DAY 
THE WINDOWS ARE PAPERED TO KEEP OUT SUNLIGHT. Caliban, glasses, hat and gloves off, prepares a tray of food as Logan enters. From somewhere, the sound of AN OLD MAN SHOUTING. 
CALIBAN He's having a bad day. 
LOGAN They're all bad days. 
Logan tosses Caliban the bag. He peers in. Logan crosses to find something to eat. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   10. 
CALIBAN He needed these six hours ago. This is not enough, you know. It won't last through the week. 
LOGAN I'm working on it. 
Caliban puts the bag of meds back in Logan's hand. 
CALIBAN Your turn. 
Logan sighs and crosses toward a cabinet. 
CALIBAN (CONT'D) You know, he told me last night he's communicating with someone. 
Caliban follows. The old man's voice getting louder. 
CHARLES They want your help, not mine. (off Logan's look) Oh, yes. That's how fucking stupid they are. They're waiting for you. At the Statue of Liberty. 
LOGAN The Statue of Liberty was a long time ago, Charles. A long time. 
Logan crosses to the old man. Takes in the worry on his face. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) There are no new mutants. Hasn't been a new one born in twenty-five years. Not anywhere. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  14. 
Charles looks off. The drugs mercifully tugging at him. 
CHARLES Impossible. 
Logan pulls the quilt over the old man. 
LOGAN You always thought we were part of God's Plan. Maybe we were just God's mistake. 
Charles touches Logan's face. A tender moment until-- 
CHARLES What a disappointment you are. 
Logan takes this in. Stung. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) When I found you, you were pursuing a career as a "cage fighter". 
LOGAN I'm not in the mood for bedtime-- 
CHARLES A warm capper to life as an assassin, hooked on barbiturates. (smiles, dark) You were an animal, but we took you in. I gave you a family. 
LOGAN (DARKENS) They're gone now. 
CHARLES What did you do? 
Logan eyes him a hard beat, then turns to go. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Answer me! Why are we here? 
But Logan ignores him, moving for the hatch. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) No one should have to live this way! Drugged! In a fucking tank! 
LOGAN It's for your own good. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                15. 
CHARLES No. NO it's NOT! You're waiting for me to die! 
EXT. SMELTING PLANT FUEL TANK -- CONTINUOUS 
Logan spins the hatch wheel, entombing the old man. He walks away as the yelling continues. 
CHARLES (O.S.) Drink new Hypno Plus! Fortified with seven nutrients and Extacine 5, for energy and vitality! 
INT. LOGAN'S BEDROOM -- SMELTING PLANT -- LATE DAY 
A SERIES OF SHOTS-- Logan on his back, unable to sleep, the sun hitting his face through a soot covered window as he stares hard at the Penny Saver boat listings: La Serenata. 
He tosses the Pennysaver. Paces like a panther. Shirtless, scarred. He stops, looks at his right hand, flexes it, stiff, arthritic, knuckles swollen, the slits moist. 
He forces his claws out. They come slow. Painfully. Middle one lagging. He grabs the middle claw with his other hand and pulls it hard, slicing into his palm, blood flowing. 
EXT. SMELTING PLANT -- SUNSET 
Stumbling in fading light, his palm wrapped with a rag, Logan drinks from a bottle and stares at the fading light as he hears Charles calling his name in the great pitched tank. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM SHOWER - SMELTING PLANT - NIGHT 
Logan lets the water run over his scars and swollen joints. Bullet wounds are closed but still visible. 
INT. LOGAN'S BEDROOM - SMELTING PLANT - NIGHT 
Logan dresses in his chauffeur blacks. His hand shakes making it hard to button his shirt. 
INT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Logan enters, finds Caliban sorting laundry... Logan pours himself a coffee, falls in a chair. 
CALIBAN I don't want to fight but we need to talk about these things. There are things. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   16. 
LOGAN What things. 
CALIBAN Well. Would it be considered nagging if repeated my observation that the dose is too low. To suppress the seizures. 
He shakes a near an empty pill bottle and puts it on the table. Logan examines it. 
LOGAN It's what the guy gave me. I wasn't in a position to make demands. 
CALIBAN I almost died this morning. That seizure was a-- 
LOGAN It wasn't even a minute. 
CALIBAN It felt a lot longer than a minute. I couldn't breathe. I was in a terrible state. You're less affected, Logan-- Please don't give me that look. You know he needs a higher dose. And I know you've got more money squirreled away. 
A red light blinks on the loading dock. Logan glares at Caliban as a rumble rises. 
LOGAN That money's to get us out of here. 
CALIBAN No. Not us. You and him. You're saving up for a bloody Sunseeker. I don't see myself hiding below deck like Nosferatu, doing laundry, do you? ...Folding your underwear. Making pigs in a blanket. 
Out another window we see-- A FREIGHT TRAIN PASSES. 
LOGAN I don't like guns. 
PIERCE Of course. (laughs; then dead serious) I wish you had called me, Logan. Like I asked. 
The man takes a step closer and Logan grabs him by the arm. Feels something there and looks at the man who smiles... PIERCE HAS A CYBORG ARM. Ending in a gleaming, metal hand. A cyborg hand missing a finger. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) (SMILES) See. You're not the only one who's BEEN ENHANCED-- 
Out of nowhere A SOUND A LOT LIKE A BOOMERANG as A LEAD PIPE - -- THWAP -- HITS PIERCE IN THE HEAD-- AND DOWN HE GOES. 
Logan turns, stunned to see-- 
THE GIRL standing by an out-building. 
LOGAN Hey! 
She looks at Logan, THEN SUDDENLY WINGS ANOTHER PIPE AT HIM. Logan watches it come and CATCHES IT, about to wing it back WHEN-- 
CHARLES Logan. 
Logan turns to see Charles in his chair at the door of the main building. Looks better than usual. Caliban behind him. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Logan. Caliban. This is Laura. 
He then smiles at the girl... 
CHARLES (CONT'D) (IN SPANISH) We've been waiting for you. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 28. 
He motions for her to come inside. Caliban looks to Logan. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) This way, child. Come here, Laura. 
The girl (LAURA) crosses, snatches her backpack from Logan, then steps over Pierce and crosses to Charles. 
Bewildered, Logan kneels pulls a GUN from Pierce's waistband. He hands it to Caliban who lands beside him, taking in the cyborg hand and the tattoo on Pierce's neck. 
CALIBAN Looks like Ex-military. Maybe a bounty hunter? 
He hands Caliban Don Pierce's business card. 
LOGAN Worse. 
Caliban reads Alkali on the card. 
CALIBAN He's by himself? 
LOGAN Not for long. (THINKING) Get him back in his ride. Drive him to the wash and dump him. Then take the car into Juarez, leave it for the vultures. 
CALIBAN What if he wakes up before I get there? 
He hands Caliban the gun. 
LOGAN Text me where you are and we'll pick you up. 
INT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - LATER - DAY 
Logan enters with a duffle, shoving supplies in it. He WATCHES AS-- 
Charles sits beside "Laura" as she ravenously eats a bowl of cereal. Charles speaks to her gently. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                29. 
CHARLES You did what you could, Laura. (she looks at him) Well. Yes. Of course, it's painful. 
Logan eyes LAURA'S BACKPACK which she keeps close. He grabs it but Laura stands, holding the strap. Logan shoves her down. She grabs his arm. 
LOGAN You'll get it back-- after I figure out what you and your mother have got us into. 
CHARLES Logan. 
LOGAN What. 
Logan peers in her bag, notices files, a toy horse and comic book. He winces, looks up as Charles wheels over. 
CHARLES That wasn't her mother you met. 
LOGAN So she talks. 
CHARLES We're communicating. 
LOGAN (hands him pills) Take them-- Now. (goes back to packing) We have to go. Leave. It isn't safe here anymore. And you can't have an attack out there. Understand? 
CHARLES (swallows the pills) She's the mutant I told you about. The one we have to help. 
LOGAN She's not a mutant. 
CHARLES Yes, she is. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                30. 
LOGAN (crossing to a duffel) What's her gift, eating? Pipe throwing? 
Logan is interrupted by A LOUD RUMBLE AS THE NIGHTLY FREIGHT TRAIN APPROACHES. Laura bolts up from the table. Charles reaches out for her... 
CHARLES It's alright, Laura. It's only a train. A choo choo. 
He nods to the monitor. We see the FREIGHT TRAIN passing in the distance. She stares at it. Like she's never seen one. 
LOGAN (EXITING) We gotta go. 
INT. CALIBAN'S CAR - DAY 
LOGAN Who the fuck are you? 
Laura slowly turns, acknowledging Logan's existence. 
CHARLES You know who she is, Logan. 
LOGAN No. I don't. 
CHARLES Does she remind you of anybody? 
Laura holds Logan's glare with her own equally hard look. 
Logan flares, peers tensely back out the windshield as he takes a hard turn. 
EXT. ABANDONED SMELTING PLANT - MORNING 
Donald Pierce steps over a mangled Reaver as the remaining "soldiers" clean up after the fight. 
PIERCE Leave nothing behind fellas. We were not here! 
He walks toward the main building, then looks back. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) Bring me the tracker. 
INT. SMELTING PLANT KITCHEN - MORNING 
Pierce steps inside and takes in the room. Picks up the RED SLICKER on the chair. Finds her ball in the pocket. 
He turns as the DOOR IS OPENED and A SERIOUSLY INJURED CALIBAN is carried inside and shoved into a chair. He's hooked up to an IV, his head is covered with a HOOD. 
Pierce rips off the hood and slaps Caliban's battered face. 
PIERCE Wakey wakey. 
Caliban blinks his pale eyes open. Pierce sits down across from him and smiles. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                40. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) You know, I read about you when I was a kid. You tracked that crazy gilled mutey fishy motherfuck, what was his name, Wave? (flutters his metal digits) Tracked him halfway `cross the Atlantic they said. And you was underwater. Inside a sub. And you found him anyway. Shit. That's a gift. That's trackin'! 
CALIBAN I'm sorry. I believe you're thinking of someone else. 
Pierce grins. SUDDENLY STRIKES Caliban with his metal hand. 
PIERCE 'I'm not mistaken, you used to work for my team, for the good guys. You were helping round up all the old mutes. 
Caliban says nothing. Pierce picks up Laura's ball. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) What changed? 'You got religion? 
Pierce slides Laura's RED SLICKER onto the table. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) Gonna need you to help the good guys one more time, and track one more special for me. 
CALIBAN I will not. I will not help you. 
Pierce turns toward the blacked out kitchen window. Starts to peel at the tar paper. 
PIERCE Of course that's what you'd say. But then I got this theory that people don't really change. 
Pierce suddenly pulls the tar paper, RELEASING A SHARD OF BRIGHT SUNLIGHT. Caliban cries out, tries to turn away. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) Beware the light, Caliban. I bet that's what your Mommy said every day when you was a kid. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 41. 
CALIBAN PLEASE-- 
PIERCE Beware the light. 
Two Reavers force his face into the bright light. The mutant's eyes open. It burns. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) Let's not bring out the worst in each other. The girl's not worth it. She's not a natural fuck-up like you. She's a business mistake. R & D gone bad. There's liability. They can't have things with patents running around hurting people. So we need to get her off board before she hurts anybody else, someone you care about maybe. 
Pierce nods to his men and they put the hood back over Caliban's head and haul him out, crying. 
WHISPERED VOICE (V.O.) ...My name is Gabriela Lopez. 
CLOSE ON -- A PHONE, GABRIELA'S PHONE 
ON THE SCREEN WE SEE-- A SHAKY SELFIE OF GABRIELA in a Mexico City apartment. She looks healthier but grim. 
GABRIELA I am a nurse and for ten years I have worked at Transigen research in Mexico City. 
On screen, we are moving through corridors of a high end research facility. See flashes of Gabriela in reflections in glass, in a nurse's uniform, recording surreptitious video. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) Transigen is a owned by an American company. And they pay better than any Mexican hospital. 
A SHAKY SHOT -- CLOSE ON letterhead from a memo -- ALKALI. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) What I am about to show you is illegal in the U.S. and Canada-- 
CLOSE ON -- A NEW SELFIE OF GABRIELA, now in a stockroom. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  42. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) --and that is why they came here. 
CUT TO -- A BRIGHTLY LIT WARD. A SLOPPY PAN ACROSS A GROUP OF DRUGGED CHILDREN (ages 5-15) as they are prodded into kennel- like enclosures decorated with tattered stuffed animals. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) These children were born in this building. They were born here and they have never left. Never seen the sun or ocean, the rain or snow or any of God's creatures. 
Sleeping mats on tile floors with exposed drains and hoses. Armed guards, some missing limbs, perhaps recognizable as Reavers, juxtaposed against the cheerful sound of musak. This place is a cross between a Children's hospital and a kennel. 
Logan crosses to the -- 
INT. TRUCK STOP MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
We look at a half closed handicapped stall door as Logan and Charles shuffle about inside. 
CHARLES Stop it. For God's sake I can do that myself! 
LOGAN Well, you're not doing it! 
EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY 
As Logan wheels Charles back to the car, he looks over at the bucking bronco ride. LAURA'S GONE. 
INT. TRUCK STOP CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY 
Laura walks down an aisle, looking at the colorful products. She grabs a can of Pringles, starts in on it. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                46. 
Then she stops and looks at a floor display of Hypno, Mag and all the variations of "energy drinks." Laura grabs a can, opens it and takes a long drink. She's bouncing as she walks now... 
A CLERK looks up from his phone at her eating snacks. 
Laura stops at a SUNGLASS RACK, munching. Notices a pair of shades. Puts them on, eats more, looking at herself. 
CLERK Yo. Girlie. You gotta pay for that. 
Laura looks up with her mouth full. She starts for the door. 
The Clerk blocks her way. She just looks up at him. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Where's your mommy and daddy? 
She continues staring. Shoves some Pringles in her mouth. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Alright, that's enough-- 
He swipes the Pringles can from her hand, about to take the sunglasses from her nose, when, in a terrifyingly swift move, she throws the clerk to the floor, straddling him, hand on his throat the other raised-- SNIKT-- claws out. 
CLERK (CONT'D) Holy shit! Oh God Jesus, No! 
That's when a hand again grabs Laura by the wrist. 
LOGAN Not okay. 
Logan pushes Laura to the door turns to the clerk-- 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Sorry. 
--then grabs a handful of CIGARS and A PHONE CHARGER, stealing a look at a security camera on his way out. 
INT. EXT LIMO -- OKLAHOMA -- NIGHT 
A great starry sky as the desert becomes the plains. The limo sits, parked along a flat stretch of Oklahoma highway. 
Laura and Charles are asleep in back. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                47. 
Logan sits up front in the darkness, legs across the bench, staring at the road ahead and then at the Pennysaver clipping for the boat on his visor. And the envelope of cash. 
A billboard up ahead hypes GAMBLING AND SHOWS IN OKLAHOMA CITY, 50 miles away. 
There is a small beep. Logan sighs, looks down to Gabriela's pink phone plugged into the charger. It's come to life. He raises the partition and hits play. 
ON THE PHONE SCREEN -- PART TWO OF GABRIELA'S VIDEO : 
WE SEE A "STAFF MEMBER" PINNED ON THE FLOOR, SKIN SMOKING, his neck being gripped by a 9 year old with glowing eyes. People scream. "Leo! Basta! Basta!" The boy leans back and starts crying. The staff member is dead. 
GABRIELA As the children became older, they became difficult to control. 
ANOTHER SURREPTITIOUS VIDEO. A BUMPY SKINNED CHILD expertly shoots an automatic weapon into target dummies in an indoor range. SUDDENLY THEY TURN AND SHOOT THE INSTRUCTOR. SCREAMS. 
A MOVING SHOT. THE BOY WITH GLOWING EYES is chased by security up a staircase to a rooftop. An alarm whoops. The boy lands outside and, for a moment, breathes air and stares at Mexico City. Panicked staff yell to him in Spanish as -- 
THE BOY THROWS HIMSELF OFF THE LEDGE. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) They taught them to kill-- but they did not remove their hearts. 
ANOTHER CHILD IS FORCIBLY CUFFED IN A NOW FAMILIAR RESTRAINT SYSTEM, hissing, spitting, VIBRATING, loose objects flying around the room. OTHER CHILDREN WATCH. Some weep. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) They could not be controlled. 
ANOTHER SHOT -- A trickle of blood runs to a drain. TILT TO FIND A YOUNG LAURA IN A SMOCK, seemingly drugged, SITTING on the floor of a tiled room. She stares at her arm as she cuts it with a metal claw, then watches it heal, then cuts again. 
The camera/phone drops and we see a dutched image of Laura as Gabriela comforts her, saying "What are you doing, baby?" in Spanish. Laura cries on her shoulder. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  48. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) A soldier who cannot be controlled is not a good soldier. 
A LONG LENS GLIMPSE OF THE RED HAIRED MAN, temperamental, gesticulating, walking up a corridor, trailed by PIERCE. 
NOW A SHOT FROM A MOVING CAR-- OF A WINDOWLESS STRUCTURE. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) (WHISPERS) Inside this building is something new. Something better than X-23. 
STOLEN SHOTS FROM IN THE NEW BUILDING-- FLASHES OF TANKS CONTAINING ADULT HUMAN ORGANS, LIMBS submerged in liquids on collagen forms: arms, hearts, feet-- some being harvested. 
GABRIELA (CONT'D) I got inside yesterday. 
THE RED HAIRED MAN confers with technicians. A Reaver notices Gabriela who hides her camera/phone. She claims (in Spanish) to be lost. 
X23-22: Can FREEZE OBJECTS with her cryogenic breath. 
X23-20: Can TRANSFORM AND MOVE ORGANIC PLANT LIFE -- grasses, trees, plants, a sort of green "Magneto". 
X23-11: Can generate seismic energy in nearby objects... Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  52. 
Logan keeps flipping through the files, until he finds the one he's really looking for: LAURA. 
"High IQ" "Volatile emotional swings" "Difficult to control" "Signs of Manic Depression in source genetics." 
"SOURCE DNA: JAMES HOWLETT." 
Clinical photos of Laura's Adamantium implant. Medical images of this little girl on a stainless table, in exquisite pain. 
Logan can't look anymore. They bring back his own dark memories. Closing it, he finds a WRINKLED PHOTO clipped to the back. It's of GABRIELA AND ANOTHER NURSE (MARIA) WITH OTHER YOUNG MUTANTS IN A LAB. On back is that address in North Dakota. And a list of names: "Delilah, Rictor, Bobby, Rebecca, Laura and Charlotte." 
Logan tucks the file back in the backpack, then notices something else... wadded in a side pocket. 
SEVERAL COMIC BOOKS. X-MEN comic books. 
LOGAN ...For fuck's sake. 
EXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING 
As Pierce and his Reavers show up and take over the place. They start sealing it off, and head in to the MINI MART... 
INT. TRUCK STOP MINI MART - MORNING 
The clerk is scared/confused as Pierce and a Reaver enter and lock the door behind them... 
CLERK Who are you guys? More cops? Dude, I already told them everything. 
INT./EXT. VAN - TRUCK STOP - MORNING 
Where a battered Caliban sits, guarded by a Reaver, the red slicker in his lap. The Reaver beside him reaches over and raises the SHADE. Caliban recoils and we now see the blisters on his face from the previous exposure to light. 
INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - SUITE - DAY 
Laura finishes tying her NEW SHOES amid some clothing boxes. She also wears a new unicorn shirt, new skirt and leggings. The ones from the display. She's pleased and meets eyes with-- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                53. 
Logan, who emerges from the bathroom with the backpack. He doubletakes at her, then grabs another bottle from the mini bar. We hear canned gunfire from the next room. 
Laura crosses to Charles in the bedroom and sits on the edge of the bed where he is watching "Shane." On screen, the big "shoot out" grabs Laura's attention. 
Logan walks in, watching indifferently. 
Laura remains riveted as on-screen-- SHANE KNEELS DOWN AND SAYS GOODBYE TO LITTLE JOEY: 
SHANE (ON TV) A man has to be what he is, Joey. Can't break the mould. I tried and it didn't work. There's no living with a killing. There's no going back. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand that sticks. Now run on home to your mother, and you tell her... everything's alright and there aren't any more guns in the valley. 
Logan looks up as he hears a sigh from Charles. 
Logan clears his throat and they both turn his way. He holds up the THE X-MEN COMIC. 
LOGAN You read this in your spare time? 
She sees the comic in his hand, backpack in the other--gets up and grabs them both from Logan and turns back to the film. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) You do know this is bullshit, right? A quarter of it happened. And none like this. In the real world, people die and no self promoting asshole in a leotard can stop it. This is just ice cream for BED-WETTERS AND-- 
CHARLES --Logan. 
Logan turns to Charles who forces a smile. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) I think Laura well understands life's impermanence. (BEAT) (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   54. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Didn't you say something about finding us a new ride? 
Logan looks at the two of them, all chummy now, and gets up. 
LOGAN Right. Fine. 
He pauses at the door and tosses a pill vial to Charles. Laura catches it. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Take two more in an hour. 
CHARLES Good-bye, Logan. 
INT./EXT. LIMO - OUTSKIRTS OF OKLAHOMA CITY - DAY 
As Logan drives past a USED CAR dealership. He goes around the corner, starts looking around, goes another few blocks until he sees what he's looking for-- 
EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY - SIDE STREET - DAY 
Shitty block. Graffiti everywhere. A GANG OF YOUNG THUGS hang beneath the interstate overpass. 
Logan gets out of his limo, checks the back, sees a couple more of Laura's UNCANNY X-MEN COMICS lying on the bench. Grabs them. Checks that's everything. Then finds several of Charles pills wedged in the car seat. 
LOGAN ...Fuck. 
He slams the door, walking past THE THUGS, tossing them the LIMO KEYS. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Knock yourselves out. 
Walking toward the car lot, Logan eyes the cars in the lot all with sale written on their windshields. 
Behind him, the thugs cross to the limo, glancing at Logan before getting in, and laying rubber in the other direction. Logan flips the liquor bottle in the trash. 
INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - 12TH FLOOR - LATE DAY 
AS LOGAN LEAPS OFF THE ELEVATOR and fights his way through the rippling force, past A MAID, FROZEN beside her cart, struggling for air to make it around the corner and down the HALL TOWARD-- 
THE CRACKED SUITE DOOR WHERE TWO ARMED REAVERS stand frozen and gurgling for air, their weapons pointed inward. 
SNIKT! -- LOGAN'S TARNISHED CLAWS EMERGE AND -- 
HE GUTS THE TWO FROZEN HELPLESS REAVERS IN TWO QUICK THRUSTS. Their blood and guts pour to the floor, their eyes wide as they perish in a standing rigor mortis. 
INT. REAVERS COMMAND TRUCK -- LATE DAY 
PIERCE, HIS ASSOCIATE AND CALIBAN, still paralyzed the wave. We see on their body cam monitors as Logan skewers the men, their life support monitors blinking -- AGENT TERMINATED. 
INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL -- SUITE -- LATE DAY 
Logan pushes through THE DOOR TO FIND-- A SURREAL SCENE: THREE MORE REAVERS FROZEN IN MID ATTACK. The room service cart up-ended. 
CHARLES sits slumped in his chair, near the window, mouth in a rictus-like grimace, body quivering, rippling waves of force emanating from his skull. 
LAURA, HER CLAWS OUT, is on the floor, semi-paralyzed, struggling to pull herself toward Charles' meds. She reaches the hypodermic, attempts to hand it to -- 
Logan who falls to his knees from the shrieking wave. He fumbles, almost dropping it, eyes starting to roll up in his own head as he lunges and jams the needle into Charles' neck. 
After a moment, RINGING stops -- Logan falls back-- the remaining Reavers fall to the ground and, as they gasp for air, Laura and Logan kill them all. Brutal. 
Charles is spent dazed, gasping for air. 
Logan peers down at one of the dead Reavers, checking him out, peering into his BODYCAM. 
LOGAN We have to go. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   59. 
INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL -- LOBBY - MINUTES LATER 
Dealers, Bellhops, patrons all stumble about in a daze -- children crying -- some people are vomiting or clawing at their heads. SIRENS IN THE DISTANCE. 
As Logan comes out of an elevator pushing a dazed Charles in his chair, Laura follows. Charles is horrified. 
CHARLES I'm so sorry. Oh God... 
INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - CASINO FLOOR - DAY 
Logan pushes Charles, fast, and Laura follows, dragging her backpack, making their way toward the glass doors. 
They zig zag through the crowd of recently unstuck patrons and employees, many sick and stumbling, choking, some crying, some scream for medical help. 
Bouncing in his chair, Charles stares at the suffering around him, stricken with empathy-- and guilt. 
Laura lingers, watching A FAT MAN GET CPR FROM A PANICKED COCKTAIL WAITRESS. The man suddenly comes to life, sucking air. The waitress' face fills with wonder. Laura stares. 
LOGAN Hey! Now! 
EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - VALET - TWILIGHT 
Catching up, Laura follows Logan and Charles out the casino doors. We hear the rising sirens of approaching first responders as the trio moves to the new pick up truck. 
LOGAN This way! 
Logan lifts Charles into the back seat, throws the chair in back bed and gets in. Laura climbs in beside Charles, who stares out the back window at the chaos as they pull away. 
The camera pans with them as they depart, then finds-- 
SEVERAL REAVER VEHICLES parked at the side of the building. 
MOVING IN ON -- THE REAVER COMMAND TRUCK. THE BACK DOORS suddenly BURST OPEN. PIERCE stumbles out, dazed, sweaty. He looks to emergency trucks approaching, cherry topped. Then his eyes find-- FIVE REAVERS. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   60. 
PIERCE Get the bodies. 
Restrained in the back of the truck, Caliban, blistered and weak, watches PIERCE, who leans against the truck to support himself, chugs some water until he feels Caliban's stare and SLAMS THE DOOR. 
INT./EXT. PICK UP - FARM COUNTRY HIGHWAY -- DAWN 
CLICK. CLACK. CLICK. CLACK. Logan drives. A good distance from the Oklahoma City, topography has changed. 
The sun breaks over the horizon. The radio chatters with breaking news reports on the event at the Casino-- speculation of a gas leak or food poisoning. 
REPORTER (ON RADIO) ...some noting a similarity to the incident last year in Westchester, New York that left 50 dead, and twice that many injured-- 
Logan SNAPS off the radio, quickly looks in back to see if Charles overheard it. Charles was sleeping. Opens his eyes. 
CLICK. CLACK. CLICK. Logan's eyes flit to Laura playing with the door lock. 
LOGAN Knock it off. 
She stares at him in the mirror, CLICK, does it again. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) I said knock it off. 
Charles takes a breath, closes his eyes. 
CHARLES She's a child, Logan. In point of fact she's-- 
LOGAN How long has it been since you took your meds? (NO RESPONSE) Charles. How long? 
CHARLES ...I don't know. Two days. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                61. 
LOGAN You saw what happened last night. If that shit had gone on longer, everyone at that casino-- 
The Trooper looks at Laura. 
TROOPER That your name, honey? (LAURA NODS) And is this man your father? 
Laura looks at Logan. A pause. Then... nods. 
CHARLES (LEANS FORWARD) My son has a bit of a lead foot. I try to tell him that Mount Rushmore will still be there and just as beautiful a day from now. 
The Trooper finishes writing the ticket... 
TROOPER You got a nice family. Try to keep `em safe, James. 
EXT. REAVER CARAVAN -- OUTSKIRTS OF OKLAHOMA CITY -- DAY 
THE CARAVAN OF REAVER VEHICLES is parked in a large paved pull out area, like a weigh station or rest stop. Local police wave traffic past, clearing the way for-- 
A FLATBED TRUCK approaching with a police escort. THERE IS A HUGE BOX STRAPPED IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   65. 
CLOSE ON -- PIERCE, looking from the arriving flatbed to -- 
A HELICOPTER growing larger in the sky. 
INT./EXT. REAVER CONTROL TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS 
Beaten, burned and shaking, confined in the back, Caliban hears the approaching chopper and peers out through a security window, watching-- 
The helicopter land on the blacktop. He shifts to a second window to see a better view of-- 
THE RED HAIRED MAN FROM THE LAB, as he steps out of the chopper and heads directly to Pierce. A silent movie as Pierce gets his ass handed to him. 
Caliban's attention shifts back to the first window as-- 
THE FLATBED TRUCK pulls up next to the control truck. Its HANDLERS look nervous. Inside the big box strapped in back, there is some sort banging, then a low guttural screaming. 
Now, the Red Haired Man, carrying a medical case, approaches the flatbed and opens the back hatch, disappearing the big box. The screaming subsides. 
Caliban collapses to the floor. Closes his eyes. 
EXT. FARM COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY 
As the pick-up truck passes a billboard that reads 
WELCOME TO CORN COUNTRY: HEART OF AMERICA. 
Fields on either side of the endless ribbon of road. In the fields are HUGE AUTOMATED THRESHERS/HARVESTERS. The machines are several times bigger than what we see on farms today. 
INT./EXT. PICK UP - FARM COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY 
As Logan navigates the pick-up through what looks like a canyon of big trucks. Laura, face pressed to the glass, stares up and out the window at all of them. 
One of them inches over and Logan is almost run off the road. 
LOGAN HEY-- 
He hits the HORN, looks up at the driverless truck cab as he pulls around. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                66. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) IN YOUR OWN LANE, ASSHOLE! 
CHARLES Language, Logan. And you're screaming at a machine. 
Logan flips off the truck anyway as he passes, gets clear of all of them. Logan sees Charles shake his head. 
LOGAN What, she can gut a man with her feet, but she can't hear naughty words? 
CHARLES She can learn to be better. 
LOGAN You mean, better than me. 
CHARLES Actually, yes. And by the way, Laura's foot claws are an obvious result of her gender. (off Logan's look) In a pride of lions, females are caregivers of the young and hunters of the pride, they have front claws to hunt and foot claws for defense. They use the foot claw to strike the belly or bladder of the attacker, thus ensuring their escape and survival. 
Laura takes this in, turns and looks out the other window. Logan sighs and drives on. 
LAURA'S POV - ANOTHER CAR An older farm pick up truck towing A HORSE TRAILER. Laura stares at the animals as they pass. 
In the back seat of the pick up sits A TEENAGE BOY. He looks back at Laura. Up front are his MOTHER and FATHER. They also look this way, smile. A farm family. 
Soon Logan has left them behind, too. A moment of quiet in the car. Logan looks in the rearview at Charles and Laura. Both seem calm, even serene, as they gaze out their windows, Laura still looking back at the horses. ...Almost normal. 
But then A LOUD HORN and Logan looks ahead as he's nearly run off the road by one of the GIANT HULKING VEHICLES coming in the other direction, crossing into his lane. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  67. 
Logan pulls the wheel one way then swerves back as LAURA'S CLAWS EXTEND AND PUNCH THROUGH THE ROOF with one hand, holds Charles with the other so they don't get thrown. 
Logan struggles to gain control of the pick-up, spins the truck around so it's facing on-coming traffic, avoids ANOTHER MEGA-TRUCK coming at them before he finally gets the pick-up onto the shoulder, facing in the direction they came from. 
The three of them watch down the highway from the shoulder (looking in the direction of where they just came) as-- 
THE FAMILY TOWING THE HORSE TRAILER ARE RUN OFF THE ROAD by one of the SAME CAREENING MEGA TRUCKS. Their horse trailer tipping onto its side at an angle, its doors swinging wide. 
Logan, Charles and Laura watch as -- FOUR HORSES now leap from the trailer, running free... 
LOGAN Shit. Oh well. 
Logan twists the wheel, prepares to pull back onto the highway and drive away. Charles puts a hand on his shoulder. 
CHARLES We have to help them. 
LOGAN We have to keep moving. Someone will come along. 
As Logan turns away, Charles reaches for him. 
CHARLES You know, Logan. This is what life looks like. A house, people who love each other. A safe place. Take a moment and feel it. (BEAT) You still have time. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   78. 
Logan looks off, distant. Troubled. 
LOGAN Charles. The world is not the same as it was. We're taking a risk here. And where we're going. Eden. It doesn't exist. Her nurse got it from a comic book. 
Charles stays quiet. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) You just need to understand-- it's not real. 
Charles looks up at Logan, his tone gentle, and firm. 
CHARLES It is for Laura. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - DEN - NIGHT 
Logan passes Laura as he comes down the stairs. He follows Will down the hall. A GUN COCKS and Logan sees Will has opened A CABINET, tucking a pistol in his waistband. 
WILL (SMILES) Don't worry. We won't need it. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DIRT ROAD - NIGHT 
As Logan and Will carry tools along a dirt access road... 
WILL Canewood Beverage bought up everything out here. Except us. When we wouldn't sell, they tried eminent domain. Then screwing with our water. Couple months ago, someone poisoned our dogs. 
LOGAN So today, out on the highway-- 
WILL Who knows. Maybe. 
Looking at the giant harvesters working the dark fields. 
WILL (CONT'D) They're like dinosaurs. Twenty ton bodies with little tiny brains. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 79. 
WILL (CONT'D) They work day and night, no drivers, shucking their cloned up super-corn. Bears fruit in half the time. Taste like shit, though. 
LOGAN So why do people eat it? 
WILL They don't. They drink it. (off Logan's look) Corn syrup. Its in all those drugged up drinks everyone's having nowadays-- to stay awake, feel strong, cheer up, sexy, whatever. Used to be a time when a bad day was just a bad day, you know? 
LOGAN Mine still are. 
Will leads Logan to a PUMP HOUSE. A tangle of intersecting irrigation pipes under a canopy. The lock HAS BEEN BROKEN. 
Logan looks out into the night, cautious. 
INT. PUMP HOUSE - NIGHT 
Will sets his tools down and looks at the pump. Someone has opened up all the valves and the place is now flooding. 
WILL Looks like we'll be here a while. 
Logan finds a convenience store cigar in his pocket. Lights it. Enjoys the moment, wind blowing through the trees. 
INT. FARMHOUSE - NATE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Rodeo trophies, posters, etc. The room of a kid who loves everything about that world. Nate -- ear buds in -- does his homework while listening to music. He looks up and sees-- 
LAURA standing in the doorway watching his every move. She looks at the trophies, curious. 
He glances at her, but tries to focus on his homework. Erases something on his electronic writing pad. 
She looks at the pad's screen. A series of equations with blanks to fill in and chicken scratch in the digital margins. He pulls out one of the buds, waves a stylus, and explains-- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                80. 
NATE I'm not too good at math. 
She stares at the equations on the pad, the screen littered with scribbles, things crossed out, then looks once more at the trophies... 
NATE (CONT'D) Those two are for breakaway roping. Those for barrel racing. Those up there are for pole bending. But all second, third place. I'm not so good at it. My dad makes me do it. 
She just looks at him. Stares at him, really. Hears music coming from the dangling bud and looks at it. 
NATE (CONT'D) You wanna listen? 
He puts the bud in her ear so that they now each have one. 
NATE (CONT'D) It's called "Devil's Whisper". It's by Raury. 
She listens to the music a moment, cuts her eyes at the older boy who can feel her looking at him. Takes a whiff of him. He finally pulls the bud from his own ear and gently passes her HIS PHONE-- 
NATE (CONT'D) Here. Take it for tonight. I'll get it back in the morning. 
She just looks back at him. He holds up his stylus... 
NATE (CONT'D) I gotta do my homework. (holds out his hand) Good-night. 
She stares at his extended hand. Then looks at the screen of the pad. She takes the stylus and hunches over him and quickly scrawls on the screen-- 
NATE (CONT'D) Hey, what are you-- 
Then he realizes that she's doing the equations. One after the other. Just like that. She finishes, then straightens up. 
NATE (CONT'D) How did you do that? Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                81. 
NOW she shakes his hand. He notices little ridges on her knuckles. Looks up at her as she puts the other bud in her ear and walks out. He sighs, goes back to his work. 
They haul Jackson to his feet, throw him in the truck, turn around and drive back the way they came. 
Logan breaks the rifle over his knee and throws the pieces into the field. He turns to see Will staring at him. 
WILL You've had training. 
LOGAN Some. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
Quiet. A moment. As Logan and Will walk back up the road. Feeling good about what they've accomplished. 
WILL Wish I had you around all the time. (HALF JOKING) Sure you don't want to stay? 
LOGAN No, but I'll take a drink if you got one. 
WILL Kathryn doesn't like booze in the house. 
LOGAN (SMILES) Maybe I got something in the truck. 
INT. FARMHOUSE -- SPARE BEDROOM -- NIGHT 
Crickets buzz in the fields. A breeze blows. Charles lies awake, looking out at the crescent moon over the farm. His eyes travel downward to find-- Laura asleep on a hooked rug. 
Then: A FLOORBOARD CREAKS and Charles turns to see-- LOGAN, in the doorway, in silhouette. He looks at Laura asleep on the floor, curled like a shrimp. He takes a step toward her. 
CHARLES ...Don't wake her yet. Let her have another hour. 
Logan looks at Charles. Charles lays back on the pillow looking out the window at the farm. Something stirring him. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                85. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) ...This was, without a doubt, the most splendid night I've had in a long time. ...but then... 
As Logan takes another step toward Laura, Charles trembles. He does not look away from the window. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) ...I don't deserve it, do I? (THEN) ...I did something... unspeakable. 
Logan turns. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) I remembered what happened in Westchester. This was not the first time I've hurt people. 
(pain fills his eyes) Until today, I didn't know. You wouldn't tell me. We just kept running from it. I'm done running. 
Charles turns to Logan. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) (ALMOST FUNNY) I think I finally understand you, Logan... (DEAD SERIOUS) ...the burden you carry... 
Logan arrives at Charles bedside. Puts his hand on Charles' shoulder. Charles cocks his head, perplexed, looking up at him in the shadows. Something is wrong. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Logan... 
LOGAN PRESSES HIS FIST INTO CHARLES' CHEST. 
Charles GASPS. Logan pulls his hand back and that's when we see his CLAWS ARE BLOODY. 
On the floor, LAURA OPENS HER EYES. 
Charles LOOKS UP FROM HIS WOUND, blood coming. He tries to reach a bedside light and succeeds as again-- THE CLAWS PLUNGE INTO HIS CHEST. IN THE LIGHT WE SEE -- THIS IS A PERFECT DOUBLE OF LOGAN. 
For simplicity's sake, let's call this creature BAD LOGAN. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 86. 
He will also be referenced as "X-24", his model number. He is a younger, stronger, clone of The Wolverine. Feral, he moves in a slight crouch. He is not the absence of emotion but rather, the presence of it, most noticeably, rage. 
LAURA FLIES AT BAD LOGAN, SHRIEKING, landing on his back, gouging his flesh. He spins, trying to shake her, swiping at his back with his blades. He stumbles across the room and slams his back on the wall, crushing her, plaster cracking. 
LAURA DROPS TO THE GROUND. Dazed. 
NATE (O.S.) Hey! 
NATE STANDS IN THE DOORWAY, a Louisville Slugger in his hand. 
His wide eyes take in Charles, bleeding, still moving, Laura on the floor, claws covered in blood. Then he looks to BAD LOGAN-- AND LUNGES-- 
A METALLIC THWACK as the bat connects with Bad Logan's head, but the clone hardly registers the impact AS WE CUT TO : 
INT. ALKALI COMMAND VEHICLE -- COUNTRY ROAD -- CONTINUOUS 
The tinny transmitted sounds of the violence play off screen as we look at the Munson farmhouse a ways off through a windshield. PAN TO REVEAL-- 
WE'RE IN THE ALKALI COMMAND VEHICLE. PIERCE AND DR. RICE are riveted to a feed from Bad Logan's bodycam. 
PIERCE Your baby boy just took out the most wanted mutey in the world. 
DR. RICE He's fantastic. 
Caliban stares, stricken, his face pressed against the bars in his cage in the rear of the truck. 
CALIBAN You said you wanted the girl! You said you just wanted the girl! 
ANOTHER REAVER SMACKS THE CAGE, knocking Caliban down. 
DR. RICE (BRIGHT EYED) I told you I was forced to bring a new tool to bear. He's just a baby and a bit of a blunt instrument. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                87. 
DR. RICE (CONT'D) But your friends had every chance. And so did you. 
WIDER -- EXT. FARMHOUSE / COUNTRY ROAD -- SAME 
WE SEE THE SEVERAL REAVER/ALKALI VANS nestled in an overgrown section of country road, among them the FLATBED WITH THE BIG BOX. Only the big doors are wide open... WE PAN TO -- 
In back, Caliban lies on the corrugated steel floor, beaten and bruised. He rises, peering through a slot. He sees: 
Logan emerging from the front door, Charles in his arms. 
Caliban blinks back tears, overcome with guilt, sorrow... 
Rice watches eagerly as Bad Logan nears their truck. 
RICE We learned the hard way with the X-23's. We assumed, because they were children, their emotional responses could be manipulated. But you can't nurture rage. You must simply design it. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   90. 
RICE (CONT'D) (SMILES) Like God did. 
Pierce spots a SECOND SET OF HEADLIGHTS coming from the other direction, the high-beams bearing down on X-24. 
PIERCE Who the fuck is that? 
EXT. FARMHOUSE -- ON THE ROAD -- CONTINUOUS 
Bad Logan now pauses, torn between competing headlights. 
JACKSON (O.S.) Will Munson! 
A broken-nosed JACKSON AND FOUR MEN jump out of his truck. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE -- LOGAN'S PICK UP -- CONTINUOUS 
Logan gently lays Charles in the back of the pick up. He tries to wrap him tighter in the quilt, pulls out his keys. 
LOGAN You need to keep this around you. Charles. Listen, you need-- 
Charles' eyes find Logan. He mutters something. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) --What? 
In the bg., distant YELLING -- 
JACKSON (O.S.) Munson, goddammit! Come out here! 
EXT. FARMHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
Jackson and his men come up the road, armed, pissed. 
JACKSON Come out here now, Munson! 
Some of the men direct Jackson's attention to Bad Logan standing there, staring at them. 
JACKSON (CONT'D) Oh. Hello, asshole. Look. 
INT./EXT. ALKALI TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS 
Rice and Pierce react as Bad Logan reverses direction, moving toward Jackson, leaving Laura in the middle of the road. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  91. 
DR. RICE No. No, no. 
EXT. FARMHOUSE ROAD -- CONTINUOUS 
Bad Logan keeps walking toward Jackson and his men. 
JACKSON I don't know what Munson's paying you, but I'm willing to let bygones be bygones. We could start you at 5G. A week that is. 
He keeps walking. They cock their weapons. 
JACKSON (CONT'D) You best stop where you are, pal. We're the law out here. 
Jackson fires a blast into X-24's chest but he keeps coming toward him -- SNIKT! -- claws emerging-- 
JACKSON (CONT'D) What in high holy-- 
Jackson never completes the thought. X-24 DECAPITATES HIM. 
JACKSON'S MEN REACT IN HORROR, start to run, but he's on them like a sprung beast. 
INT. ALKALI TRUCK -- CONTINUOUS 
DR. RICE, PIERCE and THE REAVERS are fixated on what is happening but THE CAMERA FINDS -- 
CALIBAN, curled in a ball in the back, darkness in his eyes as he watches -- LOGAN at his truck. 
DR. RICE (TO PIERCE) He's confused. We need to intervene. 
PIERCE You're the one he listens to, Doc. 
CUT TO-- LOGAN AT THE PICK-UP 
Charles' finger taps the pick up bed. Logan leans close to hear him say with a trace of a smile... 
CHARLES ...our boat... ...our Eden... Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                92. 
Charles tenderly touches Logan ...and then he passes. 
Logan stares at Charles. Gone. 
We hear the SHOUTS from Jackson's men as they fall, one by one. Only now does the sound of world seem to seep back in. 
Logan dimly aware of the blood-curdling SCREAMS... He pulls the blanket over Charles, his eyes filling with rage. 
BACK TO LAURA 
EXT. WYOMING HIGHWAY - DAYS 
Logan and Laura head north under a sign that reads: 
"WELCOME TO WYOMING." 
EXT. STAND OF TREES, OFF THE ROAD - WYOMING LAKE - MORNING 
Overlooking a small lake. LOGAN finishes covering CHARLES' GRAVE. Its physically hard for him to do this. Now he stands there, trying to think of what to say. He looks at-- 
LAURA, on the other side of the grave, a few steps back. She takes her sunglasses off. Takes the ear buds out of her ears. Ready to hear his words. 
BACK TO-- LOGAN. He looks back at the grave, then out at the lake. Clears his throat. His eyes are sallow, his skin pale. 
LOGAN Well. It's got water and... it's... 
Logan just halts. He looks down and sees-- Laura, taking his hand in hers, the same way that Kathryn did with Will at the farmhouse. She looks up at him. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) --its got water and it's -- 
Unable to contain himself, Logan pulls back his hand. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) ...Fuck this... 
He starts away, limping, with the shovel. Only now do we realize just how ravaged Logan's body still is from his battle with X-24. Blood stains everywhere. 
Laura stands there, staring as-- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                96. 
Logan stumbles to the equally ravaged pick up truck. He tosses the shovel in back and grunts something at Laura like "come on!" When she doesn't move, he curses and gets in the truck but it won't turn over. He starts cursing again and gets out and pops the hood. 
A dog barks. Laura looks out across the landscape. 
Downstream a quarter mile, A MAN crosses from a STATION WAGON with his labrador, pole on his shoulder, tackle box in hand. 
Laura looks back down to Logan. He has collapses in front of the car in a heap. 
INT. URGENT CARE CENTER - TREATMENT ROOM - DAY 
Logan lies, hooked to an IV on a small bed. He coughs and opens his eyes. He is in the examination room of some sort of small town walk-in clinic. The place is decorated in a Rocky Mountain style. Out the windows, granite peaks. An Old Doctor stands over him. He has a soulful face, a bolo tie and big belt buckle. Reminds one of Richard Farnsworth. 
OLD DOCTOR Welcome back. I was starting to think I was gonna have to tell that nice little girl out in the waiting room that her daddy's gone. 
Logan notices the EKG monitor connected to him. The Doctor sits down and smiles... 
OLD DOCTOR (CONT'D) I always hoped I would get a chance to meet someone like you. There's so few of you left. 
LOGAN ...Nice to meet you too, Doc, but I need to get on my-- 
He tries to sit up, but the old doctor puts a hand on him. 
OLD DOCTOR What you need is rest... and treatment. You need to check yourself in somewhere and-- 
LOGAN --I'm alright. I'm fine. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  97. 
OLD DOCTOR No. You're not. I mean, I know you're different. But that doesn't change the fact that something inside you is poisoning you. You need to check yourself into a hospital and run some tests, find out what it is. 
LOGAN ...I know what it is. 
Logan pulls off the wires and tubes and gets up. 
INT. URGENT CARE CENTER - WAITING ROOM - DAY 
Logan limps into the waiting area. Laura is sitting there. A Nurse looks up as the Doctor emerges, right behind him-- 
OLD DOCTOR Please. Mister. If you don't want to go to a hospital, maybe I can-- 
LOGAN --Doc. Look at me. You seem like a nice man. But you wanna save a life? Save yours. And everyone else's in this place. Let us get on our way. 
Logan turns to-- Laura. She meets his eyes. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Let's go. 
EXT. URGENT CARE CENTER - DAY 
Logan and Laura emerge from the Mountain clinic with a big sign with a red cross on it. Laura leads him, limping to-- 
THE FISHERMAN'S STATION WAGON. Yet another commandeered vehicle. She hands him the keys with a lure fob. 
LOGAN You can't just take shit, you know. 
He opens the driver's door and finds a booster seat made from bundled cardboard and a box of milkbones. Logan looks at Laura climbing in on the passenger side. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   98. 
INT./EXT. STATION WAGON - URGENT CARE CENTER - DAY 
Logan tosses the booster pile to the back and climbs in, brushing away dog hair. He starts the station wagon, but before pulling out, turns to her. 
LOGAN Look. I don't know how you got me here,.. but thank you. 
LAURA De nada. 
He stares back at her. She stares back at him. Finally. 
LOGAN ...You can talk? 
LAURA (NODS) 
LOGAN You can talk. 
INT. CONVERTED HIGH SCHOOL -- SAME 
Dr. Rice enters swiftly from a hallway, pushing through plastic drapes as if hoping to lose the collection of government types who follow him into this tented gymnasium. 
MAJOR --and we understand the importance of containment, Dr Rice. But we are in the continental United States. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               102. 
DR. RICE --Yes we are, and I terminated your goddam mutant most wanted. 
MAJOR We appreciate that but you can't just leave a war zone behind like you, like you did in Juarez. We-- 
The Major and his companions suddenly realize they are moving through a makeshift morgue. TWO DOZEN BODIES laid out as a haz mat team tags them. The bodies are mostly children, slightly off looking mutants. A few we might recognize from Gabriela's video. Also among them, Will, Kathryn, and Nate. 
DR. RICE I'd appreciate it, Major, if your associates would stop staring at the dead assets. Try to remind yourselves these were all little killing machines, machines who would have happily disemboweled your family. 
MAJOR Not all. 
DR. RICE (spins, livid) I was told you want these assets off board, dead or alive. Are you changing my brief?! Are you? 
The people stop walking. 
MAJOR ...No. 
DR. RICE (SMILES) Okay. Good bye. 
Rice heads for a side door, pausing by another table where the BURNED CORPSE OF CALIBAN lies curled. 
DR. RICE (CONT'D) Save tissue from this one. He was a good tracker and had a high IQ. 
INT./EXT. SCHOOL EXIT / TENT INFIRMARY -- SAME 
Rice walks out of the school building, blows past an MP and the fleshy nurse, crossing into the infirmary tent. He finds Pierce getting dressed, pulling the IV, grabbing a crutch. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               103. 
DR. RICE You're up? 
Pierce hands Rice -- THE WRINKLED PHOTOGRAPH. 
PIERCE Look at that. Was found at the farmhouse. I know. It's her. But look at the other side. 
Rice turns it to reveal-- The coordinates in North Dakota. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) Those are the coordinates of a fire road in the Badlands. A reservation near the Border. And, according to Wikipedia, its also this. 
He hands a tablet with the "EDEN EXODUS" X-MEN COMIC cued on the screen. Rice regards it skeptically. Thousands of mutants in Exodus, headed for the Badlands. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) Gaby loved that shit. 
INT. CONVERTED HIGH SCHOOL LOCKER ROOM -- SAME 
A MEXICAN WOMAN looks up in terror as a door unlocks. She looks familiar, despite the bruises and blood. An armed guard looks up from a show on his phone. 
DR. RICE Hello, Maria. 
And now we recognize the name and face: Maria, the other nurse in Gabriela's video. 
DR. RICE (CONT'D) So I understand that your mother and son are safe at the holding center in Guadalupe. We're looking after them both of them. 
Maria is sickened by the notion. 
MARIA Wh-what more do you want from me? 
Rice takes out the tablet containing the X-Men comic. Her blanching expression immediately betrays her: she knows this place, knows what it means... 
DR. RICE Connect the fucking dots, dear. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  104. 
She looks up at him, gripped by fear. Rice just smiles. 
EXT. WINDING HIGHWAY - DAY 
As the station wagon moves along winding road through the mountains. It starts to drift off the road... 
INT./EXT. STATION WAGON - HIGHWAY - BADLANDS - DAY 
Logan at the wheel. Laura shoves him and he wakes up, swerves back off the shoulder. She nods to the wheel, speaks Spanish: 
LAURA Let me drive. 
LOGAN No. Absolutely not. 
He's barely awake. Barely alive, it seems. He's bruised and broken. Blood runs from his sleeve from some unseen cut or cuts on his arm. He turns to see Laura still looking his way. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Quit looking at me. 
LAURA (SPANISH) You're dying. 
LOGAN No comprende. 
LAURA You are dying. 
Logan turns to her. Looks away. To weary to say anything. 
LAURA (CONT'D) You want to die. (off Logan's look) Charles told me. 
LOGAN (REACTS) What else did he tell you? 
LAURA To not let you. 
She grabs the wheel, pulls to the right, taking them onto the shoulder. Logan tries to fight it but can't. Hits the brakes. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               105. 
LAURA Por que? 
LOGAN I hurt people. 
Laura takes this in. Then pulls something from her pocket. Logan's Adamantium bullet. 
LAURA (IN SPANISH) What is this? 
LOGAN You know what it is. 
Logan nods, tries to sit up. In pain. She hands it to him. He rolls it in his fingers. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) It's made of Adamantium. Same thing they put inside us. That's why it can kill us. Probably killing me now. Anyway, I got that a long time ago. Kept it as a reminder of what I am. Now I keep it to-- (looks at her plainly) Actually, I was thinking about shooting myself with it. Like Charles said. 
Laura's smile fades. 
LAURA I've hurt people too. 
Logan looks off. 
LOGAN You're gonna have to learn how to live with that. 
LAURA They were bad people. 
LOGAN All the same. 
Logan closes his eyes. The bullet sits in his open palm. Laura takes it. 
BLACK. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               109. 
INT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- DAY 
Logan awakes to hear children playing outside. He watches as some of the kids play a simple game of soccer. Suddenly one of the girls wiffs and kicks right past a ball and then continues prancing, her legs kicking high, arms waving like a puppet. Some of the boys laugh. 
GIRL Jonah! Stop! STOP! 
Logan sees little Jonah manipulating the girl like a puppeteer. Everything he does, kicking out his legs, waving his arms, she is somehow forced to do, a mirror image. Some of the other kids come to her defense -- 
LIZARD BOY Jonah, let go! Now! 
It all ends suddenly when Rictor steps up behind Jonah and slaps him upside the head. 
RICTOR Cut the shit. 
Another kid kicks the loose ball off the edge of the cliff and REBECCA, runs right off the edge of the cliff to catch the ball, then returns, walking on air. 
Logan lies back in bed. Weak. But looking better. 
BLACK. 
INT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- NIGHT 
From across the darkened room, Bobby walks up to Logan. Logan considers him a moment. Bobby holds up an action figures, a vintage toy, the paint chipped. As if expecting a reaction from him. It's a Wolverine figure, then he holds up another. 
BOBBY ...Was Sabretooth real? 
LOGAN What. 
BOBBY Laura said you said all the stories in the comic books were lies. 
LOGAN Not all. Not completely. Sabretooth was real. He was in a program with me. Like what they did to you. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  110. 
BOBBY So you did mean things with him. 
LOGAN Yes. 
BOBBY But now you're doing good things. 
Logan looks at the kid a moment, then-- 
LOGAN Kid, I don't know what I'm doing. 
BLACK. 
INT. CLIFF TOP STRUCTURE -- DAY 
The sound of snipping. Giggles. 
Then we see nearly all the kids standing around Logan's cot with glowing grins on their faces. Laura among them, although she slides into the back of the pack as he sits up. BOBBY AND REBECCA hide scissors behind their backs. 
And now we see why. They have cut Logan's beard. Strike that. They have shaped Logan's beard into mutton chops. They have snipped off his moustache and soul patch. He touches his face, guessing what they've done-- and crosses, limping to -- 
TO A MIRROR. They all squeal in joy as he takes in his reflection. Then he glares at them. 
LOGAN Not funny. Not funny at all. 
Rictor suddenly hurries through the space, moving from one room to the next. Logan moves after him -- 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Hey, pal, how long have I been out? 
But Rictor is already moving off outside-- 
EXT. CLIFF TOP -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS 
Logan hobbles after Rictor, who passes Jonah, packing a backpack. 
LOGAN Hey. 
LAURA Such a nice man. 
LOGAN Hey, I never asked for this. 
She starts to move off again. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Look, I don't know what Charles put in your head, but I'm not... whatever it is you think I am. 
Laura looks off, defiant, hurt. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) You don't need me. You've got Rictor, Delilah, Rebecca, Bobby, blah blah whoever. Hey. It's better this way. I suck at this. Bad shit happens to people I care about. 
Laura meets his eyes. 
LAURA Then I will be fine. 
And she walks off. 
ON LOGAN, watching her go. Resisting every urge to chase after her-- he SLAMS the door. 
ON LAURA OUTSIDE, at the edge of the cliff, looking out at the stars as she wipes her eyes, the faint laughter and noise of the kids nearby. She glances back at Logan's door... then turns to join them. 
INT. TOP OF CLIFF -- BUNK AREA -- PRE-DAWN 
Logan asleep in his corner. He stirs awake. 
He sees something near his face. A hypodermic and one last vial of the green fluid on top of a backpack. Beside it, a note: "NOT ALL AT ONCE. - RICTOR" 
EXT. TOP OF CLIFF -- DAWN 
Logan ventures out by first light. It's eerily quiet here now. All the kids are indeed gone. Laura too. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                 115. 
Logan continues walking through the now-abandoned structure, reckoning with the choice he made. 
EXT. EDEN - TOP OF CLIFF - DAWN 
Logan is looking down at his station wagon still parked in the swale -- when he halts. Hears a buzzing, then looks upward and sees -- 
A flock of drones flying by overhead, fanning out. 
INT./EXT. EDEN -- LOOKOUT TOWER -- DAWN 
Logan bursts in, hurries to-- THE TELESCOPE -- the one that Rictor had Laura peer through yesterday. Logan brings his eye to the viewfinder... 
LOGAN'S POV THROUGH TELESCOPE: the same distant mountain and crevasse that Laura had seen, five miles away, looming like a beacon, haloed violet by the rising sun. 
Logan breathes, at once relieved and regretful. About to step away -- when he swings the telescope and sees -- 
LOGAN'S POV THROUGH TELESCOPE: something is moving toward the base of the mountain... black objects, rustling trees... Logan adjusts focus and sees-- 
A CONVOY OF MILITARY AND ALKALI VEHICLES... 
Logan drops back from the telescope-- 
INT. EDEN CLIFF TOP -- BUNK AREA -- MOMENTS LATER 
LOGAN GRABS that vial of green fluid and the needle. Throws them in the backpack, eyes fixed in alarm -- 
EXT. THE WOODS -- DAWN 
Logan bounding through the woods... but he is already out of breath... stumbling... 
Up ahead he starts to hear the echoed cracks of GUNFIRE, children crying out, shrieking-- 
Logan falls to the ground. Gasping, coughing, his wounds starting to reopen. About to lose consciousness, he reaches into the backpack, fumbling with the syringe and the vial. Draws everything in the container and injects himself... 
Logan's eyes go wide as the drug hits his bloodstream. He screams. Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               116. 
EXT. DEEPER IN THE WOODS -- DAWN 
It's a free-for-all as the Reavers descend on their prey -- the kids fleeing in all directions, desperately trying to find cover in the maze of trees, bullets spraying, among those running for their lives, Laura -- 
LIZARD BOY disappears like a chameleon into the bark of a tree to avoid a chasing Reaver. 
Once the Reaver passes, Lizard Boy steps out from the tree, thinking he is safe, and turns to find Pierce standing there. He fires his side arm into the boy's chest. 
LIZARD BOY Ow. 
Lizard boy drops to the ground and Pierce leaves his body to be dragged away by Reavers behind him. 
NOT FAR AWAY IN THE WOODS -- 
DR. RICE rides in a jeep with two soldiers. He watches the battle ahead from a safe distance. Behind him lumbers the Alkali Control Vehicle. 
RICE Move faster. We can't let them get to the border. 
ELSEWHERE IN THE WOODS -- 
ELLA is cornered by several soldiers, who advance on her. Her eyes roll up in her head as she draws on her powers and -- 
PINE NEEDLES LIFT FROM THE GROUND AND TEAR FROM THE TREES, swirling into a whirlwind. The needles envelope the soldiers in a vortex, blinding them, stabbing them, shredding their skin, filling their mouthes, gagging them. 
A SOLDIER GRABS ELLA from behind, covering her eyes. The needles fall to the ground. As he proceeds to shackle her wrists-- LAURA LEAPS UPON HIM, SPEARING HIM WITH HER CLAWS. 
Laura and Ella run away as other soldiers fire upon them. Laura tries to pull her friend, she is not fast enough. 
LAURA (IN SPANISH) Ella! Run faster! Run! 
RICE'S JEEP COMES TO A STOP BEHIND PIERCE. 
Laura looks to-- Logan, clutching for air. 
PIERCE Green juice is wearing down, huh? For an ol' mute, that a short high. Gonna be hard to keep those claws out soon. 
RICTOR (thrashing, to Logan) Waste this dick, Logan! 
Pierce knocks Rictor unconscious with the butt of his gun, then aims the muzzle at Rictor's head. He looks back up at-- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               120. 
Logan, weak, standing there. Dr. Rice steps up behind Pierce. 
DR. RICE Please stop, Mr. Howlett, or I am going to have to tell these men to fire on these children. You can see the effects of the serum are wearing off. You will not survive any further wounds. 
Logan glares at Rice, glances at Laura as she encircles the remaining Reavers guarding her friends. 
DR. RICE (CONT'D) It's an honor to meet you. I'm Zander Rice. I believe you knew my father on the Weapon X program. 
Logan's dark look goes darker. He holds up his bloody claws. 
LOGAN He's the asshole who put this poison in me. 
DR. RICE Yes he was. One of them. 
LOGAN I think I might have killed him. 
DR. RICE I think you're right. 
PIERCE Shit. Show some respect, mutey. You're lookin' at the man who wiped out your kind. 
DR. RICE My friend Donald overstates. The goal was not ending mutant-kind but controlling it. I realized we needn't stop perfecting what we eat and drink when we could use those products to perfect ourselves. 
Laura sneaks closer to two of the Reavers, poised to attack. 
DR. RICE (CONT'D) To distribute gene therapy discreetly, through, well, everything -- from sweet drinks to breakfast cereal. And it worked. (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  121. 
DR. RICE (CONT'D) Random mutancy went the way of polio. And we embarked on our next endeavor. 
Logan's eyes drift from Pierce to Rice to Laura, claws out. 
LOGAN Growing mutants of your own. 
PIERCE Dangerous times, James. We can't trust fate to-- 
He lifts his pistol AND SHOOTS ZANDER RICE IN THE HEAD. The Doctor falls back, dead, in the grass. 
LOGAN Yeah. Dangerous. 
Two Reavers lunge for their weapons but Laura surprises them, slitting their throats as-- 
LOGAN SHOOTS AGAIN, BLOWING OFF PIERCE'S CYBORG HAND-- and he is about to shoot a kill-shot on Pierce but the pistol clicks, its chamber empty. 
Pierce turns and runs towards the Alkali control truck. 
Logan stumbles after him, claws out now. 
Pierce grabs hold of the control van door, throws it open-- 
PIERCE It's showtime, boy! 
AND A HUGE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE VAN, BLIND-SIDING LOGAN. 
It is X24 and he slashes at Logan mercilessly. The fight between them is bloody and feral. 
Laura watches, terrified. 
Logan struggles to stay on his feet, but there is fear in his eyes. He doesn't know if he can hold his own against this younger stronger version of himself. 
The commotion distracts the two Reavers guarding the children who raise their weapons. 
A THIRD REAVER lines up a shot, putting Logan in his cross hairs, when he is suddenly taken out by Laura. 
Sensing their attention is elsewhere, young Bobby shifts his weight, extending his finger, eyes rolling in his head as -- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                               122. 
AN ELECTRICAL BOLT ARCS OFF HIS FINGER leaping to the jeep, ELECTROCUTING THE TWO REAVER GUARDS. 
Laura turns back as-- 
X-24 GRABS LOGAN AND TOSSES HIM LIKE A RAG DOLL into open door of the control van. 
Bleary, Logan grabs the fallen door, summons his remaining strength and smashes X24 with it, knocking the monster to the dirt. Logan reaches deep, bringing the iron door down like a guillotine on X-24's throat. 
Rictor come to consciousness in the grass, his eyes finding-- 
X24, pinned on the ground, struggling to breathe, the van door pressing against his neck. X24 catches sight of Dr. Rice, his fallen master. 
Pierce watches, his survival riding on X24's ability to get up and defeat Logan. 
PIERCE (CONT'D) Get up! Get up, boy! That's right! He killed your Daddy! 
X24 howls in rage and breaks Logan's hold, leaping at Logan, mauling him and hurling his limp, bloody body beyond the jeeps. 
Satisfied with himself, X24 is shocked when-- 
RICTOR Laura! No! 
LAURA LEAPS ON X24'S BACK and slashes at him.

INT. CLASSROOM DAY 
A private day school. Twenty 10th grade boys are sitting in desks in geometry class. They are dressed in school uniform, light blue shirts and khakis. The boys look dazed and sleepy. 
The teacher, MR. ADAMS, is at the front of the room, finishing a complicated equation on the chalkboard. 
MR. ADAMS 
Except when the value of the x coordinate is less than or equal to the value of the -- Yes, Isaac? 
A boy named ISAAC has raised his hand 
ISAAC 
What about that problem? 
Isaac points to a startling and intricate arrangement of huge numbers and strange symbols filling up a forgotten corner of the chalkboard. The heading above it says Extra Credit. 
MR. ADAMS 
Oh, I really just put that up there as a joke. That's probably the hardest geometry problem in the world. 
ISAAC 
How much extra credit is it worth? 
MR. ADAMS 
Well, I've never seen anyone get it right before, including my mentor, Dr. Leaky at MIT. So I guess if anyone here can do it, 
(pause) 
I'd see to it that none of you ever have to open another math book again for the rest of your lives. 
There is some quite murmuring. The name Fischer is repeated over and over. The boys begin to look to a student in the back row. 
Unlike his classmates, he wears the Rushmore school blazer with insignia on the breast pocket and a Rushmore rep tie knotted tightly. His hair is smartly parted and swept back. He is extremely skinny and pale. He is MAX FISCHER. 
Max has a cup of coffee on his desk and he is reading the Wall Street Journal. 
MR. ADAMS 
Max ? You want to try it ? 
Max looks up. 
MAX 
I'm sorry. Did someone say my name? 
Everyone laughs. Max smiles slightly. He buttons his blazer and straightens his tie. He picks up his cup of coffee and takes a sip. He goes to the chalkboard and sets to work. 
The boys watch with nervous anticipation. Mr. Adams compares Max's progress with e notes in his book. Max's equations quickly fills up most of the chalkboard. He finishes it with a flourish, throws his piece of chalk in the trash, and turns to face the 
class. 
Everyone looks to Mr. Adams. Mr. Adams raises an eyebrow. He nods. 
The classroom erupts into wild, ecstatic applause. Everyone surrounds Max, cheering, as he walks calmly back to his desk. They hoist him into the air. 
CUT TO: 
Max with his eyes closed, smiling serenely, listening to the applause. He mutters: 
MAX 
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please. 
A little hand grabs Max's arm and shakes him. Max opens his eyes. The person shaking him is his chapel partner, DIRK CALLOWAY, a fourth grader with neatly white hair. Max looks around. 
They are in chapel, surrounded by rows of boys in school uniforms. Dirk puts his finger to his lips. 
DIRK 
Shh. 
Max rubs his eyes and sits up in the pew. The applause dies down and Max looks to the pulpit as the guest chapel speaker, HERMAN BLUME, steps up to the microphone. 
Mr. Blume is a tough looking guy about fifty years old in a black suit. He begins his chapel speech. 
MR. BLUME 
You guys have it real easy. I never had it like this where I grew up. But I send my kids here. Because, the fact is, whether you deserve it or not: you go to one of the best schools in the country. 
Max's eyes light's up. 
MR. BLUME 
Rushmore. You lucked out. 
Max leans forward to the railing and begins to listen intently. 
MR. BLUME 
Now, for some of you it doesn't matter. You were born rich, and you're going to stay rich. But here's my advice to the rest of you: take dead aim on the rich boys. Get them in the crosshairs. And take them down. 
Some of the students and faculty begin to look at each other with puzzled expressions. Max is nodding and taking notes on the flypage of a hymnal. 
INSERT HYMNAL: 
Rushmore -- best school in country. 
rich kids -- bad? 
MR. BLUME 
Just remember: they can buy anything. But they can't buy backbone. Don't let them forget that. Thank you. 
Mr. Blume leaves the podium. Max leaps to his feet and leads the applause. The organ starts and everyone stands up. 
EXT. QUADRANGLE DAY 
Mr. Blume and the headmaster, DR. GUGGENHEIM, come out of the chapel among the throng of students. 
Dr. Guggenheim wears a wool coat and smokes a pipe. He is very dashing with silver hair and a warmly patronizing manner. He walks with his hands clasped behind his back. 
Two Jack Russell terriers follow quickly at his heels. 
DR. GUGGENHEIM 
Are you free for graduation, Herman? Maybe you could give us an encore. (whistles to the dogs) Nicholas! Copernicus! 
MR. BLUME 
(lighting a cigarette) 
I don't give a shit. I paid for the whole damn natatorium. The least these little pricks can do is hear me out. 
MAX 
Mr. Blume. 
Max has appeared beside them. Dirk tags along behind him. 
MAX 
DR. GUGGENHEIM 
You're not dyslexic. 
MAX 
Well, I'm a terrible speller. 
DR. GUGGENHEIM 
Just bring up the grades. 
Max sighs. He looks out the window and says quietly: 
MAX 
Do you remember how I got into this school? 
DR. GUGGENHEIM 
Yeah, I do. You wrote a play. 
MAX 
That's right. A little one act. And my mother read it and felt I should go to Rushmore. And you read it, and you gave me a scholarship, didn't you ? 
Dr. Guggenheim nods. 
MAX 
Do you regret it? 
DR. GUGGENHEIM 
No, I don't regret it. But I still might have to expel you. 
Max nods. He smiles sadly and whispers: 
MAX 
Couldn't we just let me float by? For old times' sake? 
DR. GUGGENHEIM 
(grimly) 
Can't do it, Max. 
EXT. QUADRANGLE. DAY 
Max and Dirk come out the door into the cold. They head across the grass. 
MAX 
They want to kick me out, Dirk. 
DIRK 
(concerned) 
Oh, no. Not again. What are you going to do? 
MAX 
The only thing I can do. Try and pull some strings with the administration, I guess. 
DIRK 
(pause) 
Maybe you ought to get a tutor. 
MAX 
I don't have time for a goddamn tutor. You know my schedule. 
INSERT SIGN WRITTEN IN CALLIGRAPHY: 
BACKGAMMON CLUB. 
Founder: Max Fischer. 
INT. LIBRARY DAY 
A long table in the Rushmore library. Max is reading a library copy of a book about Jacques Cousteau. He is also playing backgammon with a freshman named ALEX. 
ALEX 
Did you hear they're teaching Japanese next year? 
MAX 
That's the rumor. 
ALEX 
And they're canceling Latin. 
MAX 
What? I tried to get Latin canceled for five years. "It's a dead language," I'd always say. 
ALEX 
Well, I guess they finally heard you. 
Max shakes his head as this sinks in. 
MAX 
At least I saved Dirk from the horror. 
Max turns the page of his book. There is a little note written in the margin in pencil with an arrow pointing to the text. Max frowns. He turns the book sideways to read it. 
INSERT FRAGMENT OF NOTE IN BOOK: 
which reminds me of a quote from Henry James: Try to be one of the people whom nothing is lost. 
Max's frown disappears. A change comes over his face. His eyes glaze over dreamily. He looks to Alex. 
MAX 
Who's Henry James? 
ALEX 
I don't know. 
Max looks back at the book. He studies the quote. He gets up and goes to the check-out counter. He shows the book to the LIBRARIAN. 
MAX 
What does this mean? 
The librarian reads the Henry James quote. 
LIBRARIAN 
It means try to be worldly. 
MAX 
You mean like smart. 
MAX 
You think I'm spending too much of my time starting up clubs and putting on plays? 
MR. FISCHER 
I don't know. It's possible. 
MAX 
I should probably be trying harder to score chicks. That's the only thing anybody really cares about. (sighs deeply) But it's not my forte, unfortunately. 
MR. FISCHER 
It'll happen, Max. It's just. You're like one of those clipper ship captains. You're married to the sea. 
MAX 
Yes, that's true. 
(pause) 
But I've been out to sea for a long time. 
EXT. SOCCER FIELD. DAY 
Miss Cross is sitting on the bleachers watching her class play Capture-the-Flag. She opens a book. It is 20,000 Leagues under the Sea. She puts a cigarette in her mouth and searches in her pocket for a lighter. 
A lit match appears in front of her. Max is holding it. He is wearing a maroon beret, Miss Cross looks at him curiously. 
MAX 
Hello. 
MISS CROSS 
Hi. 
Miss Cross lights her cigarette on Max's match. 
MISS CROSS 
I like your hat. 
MAX 
Thank you. You're a teacher here, aren't you? 
MISS CROSS 
Uh-huh. 
MAX 
What subject do you teach? 
MISS CROSS 
Well, I teach first grade, so I do all the subjects. Except music. 
MAX 
And this is your first year at Rushmore, I take it. 
Miss Cross nods. 
MAX 
I see. How long have you been a smoker, if you don't mind me asking? 
MISS CROSS 
(surprised) 
Hm. Let's see. How old are you? 
MAX 
Fifteen. 
MISS CROSS 
Since I was your age. 
MAX 
(shocked) 
You're kidding. 
Miss Cross shakes her head. Max can't believe this. 
MAX 
You should quit. 
MISS CROSS 
You're right. 
MAX 
(going back to his book) 
And I should mind my own business. 
Miss Cross laughs. Max looks back up. 
MAX 
Where'd you go to school, by the way? 
MISS CROSS 
Harvard. 
MAX 
Really? That's a coincidence. My top schools where I want to apply to are Oxford and The Sorbonne. But my safety is Harvard. 
MISS CROSS 
(smiles) 
That's very ambitious. 
MAX 
Thank you. 
MISS CROSS 
What are you going to major in? 
MAX 
Well. I haven't decided for sure. But probably a double major in Mathematics and Pre-Med. What was your major? 
MISS CROSS 
Latin-American studies. 
MAX 
I like them. 
MR. BLUME 
(surprised) 
Really? 
MAX 
Sure. 
Ronny flips his opponent on the mat and flattens him with his body. Donny screams encouragement. 
MR. BLUME 
No. You're right. They're good kids. 
Max nods solemnly. 
WRESTLER 
See you Sunday, Mr. Blume. 
A stocky Wrestler with an ice pack on his arm walks by on his way to the showers. Mr. Blume nods to him without looking up. 
MAX 
What's Sunday? 
Mr. Blume looks to Max. Silence. 
MR. BLUME 
The twins are having a birthday party. And I'd love it if - 
MAX 
Oh, that's right. Yeah. I'm not going to be able to make it to that one. 
Max smiles very sincerely. Silence. 
MR. BLUME 
Come work for me. 
MAX 
(stiffens) 
What do you mean? 
MR. BLUME 
I mean, I could use somebody like you. I could - 
MAX 
I may not be rich, Mr. Blume. And my father may only be a doctor. But we manage. 
MR. BLUME 
(hesitates) 
I didn't mean it like that. I just - 
MAX 
No, thank you. I mean, I appreciate the offer. But I've got everything I need right here at Rushmore. Besides, it wouldn't be fair. 
REFEREE 
110s! 
MAX 
Excuse me, Mr. Blume. Nice talking with you. 
Max pulls off his blazer. He is wearing wrestling tights underneath. Mr. Blume looks surprised. 
MR. BLUME 
You're on the team? 
MAX 
(shrugs) 
I'm an alternate. 
Max heads out to the mat, pulling on his headgear. Mr. Blume calls after him: 
MR. BLUME 
What wouldn't be fair, Max? 
MAX 
(smiles crookedly) 
We'd make way too much money working on the same team. 
Mr. Blume smiles faintly. He watches as Max begins his match. Max is outclassed and quickly gets pinned. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Miss Cross is shepherding her class into her classroom. They are singing a song as they walk down the corridor. Across the hall, a fourth-grade teacher, Mrs. Guggenheim, comes out of her classroom. She is a handsome woman in her late sixties with black and silver hair. 
MISS CROSS 
Hello, Mrs. Guggenheim. 
MRS GUGGENHEIM 
Hi, Rosemary. Did you find a place? 
MISS CROSS 
Well, I'm just staying over at Edward's parents' house for now. They're out of town. 
MRS GUGGENEHIM 
Oh. That's good. 
(pause) 
Edward was one of my students, you know. 
Miss Cross smiles and nods. Silence. Miss Cross points to a photograph in a collage on a wall. 
MISS CROSS 
I think I met that boy yesterday. 
Mrs. Guggenheim looks at the picture. 
INSERT PHOTOGRAPH: 
It is black and white of Max in fifth grade singing a show tune. His arms are opened wide and he has a top hat in one hand and cane in the other. 
MRS GUGGENHEIM 
(frowns) 
How did you decide to teach at Rushmore? 
MISS CROSS 
My husband went here. 
Max drops the can of fish food into the tank. He quickly fishes it out. 
He picks some little bits of fish food out of the water and throws them away. Pause. 
MAX 
I didn't know you were married. 
MISS CROSS 
Well, he's dead now. So I'm not actually married. 
MAX 
When did he die? 
MISS CROSS 
Last year. 
Max nods. Silence. 
MAX 
My mother's dead. 
MISS CROSS 
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. 
MAX 
She died when I was seven. (raising an eyebrow) 
So we both have dead people in our families. 
They look at each other for a minute. 
MAX 
Now what's going on in here? 
Max kneels down and looks into one of the fish tanks. There are a hundred little seahorses swimming around in it. 
MISS CROSS 
Those were just born. 
A look of wonder comes across Max's face. He stares into the blue water. 
MAX 
You really love fish, don't you? 
Miss Cross nods. Max puts his fingers to the glass. 
MAX 
How much do these cost? 
INT. BLUME INTERNATIONAL CONCRETE - DAY 
Mr. Blume's office. HE is talking on the telephone. Max sits in a chair across from him. 
MR. BLUME 
I don't want any alloys. I want steel. 
(pause) 
I don't give a rat's ass if he did. (pause) Steel, Harry. 
He hangs up. 
MR. BLUME 
You change your mind? You want the job? 
MAX 
No. But I've got an idea. And need some money. 
Mr. Blume's secretary buzzes him on the speakerphone. 
SECRETARY 
Mr. Blume, they're ready for you in Hydraulics. 
MR. BLUME 
Come with me. Let's hear your idea. 
INT. FACTORY - DAY 
Max, Mr. Blume, and a big foreman named Ernie race across the factory in a souped-up golf cart. They're squeezed together with Max in the middle. 
MAX 
Rushmore deserves an aquarium. A first class aquarium where scientists can lecture, and students can study marine life in their natural - 
MR. BLUME 
I don't know. What do you think, Ernie? 
ERNIE 
(skeptical) 
An aquarium? 
MAX 
A huge aquarium. An entire building. 
MR. BLUME 
What kind of fish? 
INT. FACTORY - DAY 
Mr. Blume and Max, wearing hard hats, stand on a scaffolding overlooking a huge cat of bubbling concrete. 
MAX 
(shouting) 
Electric eels. Barracudas. Stingrays. Hammerheads. Piranhas. 
MR. BLUME 
Piranhas? 
MAX 
That's right. Piranhas. I talked to a man in South America. 
MR. BLUME 
MISS CROSS 
Yes. And that's all we're going to be. 
MAX 
That's what I meant by relationship. You want me to grab a dictionary? 
MISS CROSS 
I just want to make sure we understand each other. 
MAX 
I understand. You're not attracted to me. C'est la vie. I'm a big boy. 
MISS CROSS 
Max. You're fifteen. Attraction doesn't enter into it. 
MAX 
If you say so. All I'm getting at is I've never met anyone like you. Take that for whatever it's worth. 
She thinks about this for a minute. 
MISS CROSS 
I think I can safely say I've never met anyone like you, either. 
MAX 
You haven't, have you? 
Miss Cross shakes her head. Max says quietly: 
MAX 
You want to shake hands? 
She puts out her hand and they shake hands across the desk. But they don't let go. They just look at each other. 
MAX 
I'm glad we had this conversation. 
MISS CROSS 
Me too. 
They finally let go of each other's hands. Miss Cross looks away. She's not exactly sure what they just decided. 
MAX 
By the way. Are you free? Thursday night? 
MISS CROSS 
Free for what? 
MAX 
Dinner. 
She looks at Max strangely. 
MAX 
We're getting a group together after the play. 
INSERT PLAYBILL: 
SERPICO 
A new play by Max Fischer. 
INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT 
A very realistic set for a New York tenement apartment. 
Four men sit at a table. Three wear dark suits: O'Reilly, Burnum and Fields. One has long hair, a beard, leather pants and a big silver crucifix around his neck. This is Frank Serpico. They are all played by high schoolers. 
FRANK 
I can't wear a wire! They're feeling me up every day! 
O'REILLY 
Come on, Frank. You'll have complete protection. 
FRANK 
(walking off) 
I've heard that one before. I got to go put a dime in the meter. 
BURNUM 
Look, Officer Serpico. If you agree to testify in open court - 
Frank wheels around and knocks the clipboard out of O'Reilly's hands. He grabs O'Reilly by both arms. Fields instinctively draws his firearm. 
FRANK 
Promise me one thing, O'Reilly. You're going to follow this all the way. To the end (snaps) Of the line, (snaps) where I got to be. 
O'REILLY 
(looking Frank right in the eye) 
So help me, God. 
The audience is deeply engrossed. A row of small kids are sitting on the floor very front. 
Max watches from the wings. He looks out at the audience. 
He sees Mr. Blume smiling proudly in the third row. 
He sees Miss Cross sitting next to a big, curly-haired Medical Student in surgical scrubs. She leans close to him and whispers something in his ear. He smiles and nods and whispers something back. 
Max stares at them blankly as a shoot-out erupts onstage. 
INT. BACKSTAGE - NIGHT 
Frank comes offstage with a bandage of his cheek and a cane in his hand. Max is waiting for him backstage. Max has on a headset and carries a clipboard. He is extremely keyed-up. 
MAX 
What happened to the cannoli line? 
Max follows Frank as Frank walks quietly toward the dressing room. 
MAX 
You're supposed to say, "Forget about it, Sanchez -" 
FRANK 
(very angry) 
I made a mistake, all right? It doesn't make any difference, anyway. 
MAX 
MISS CROSS 
(angry) 
You're the one who ordered him a Scotch and soda. 
MAX 
What's wrong with that? I can write a hit play. Why can't I have a drink when I want to unwind a little? So tell me, Curly. How do you know Miss Cross? 
JOHN 
We went to Harvard together. 
MAX 
(shrugs) 
And I wrote a hit play. And directed it. So I'm not sweating it, either. 
MR. BLUME 
(signaling the waiter) 
I'm going to get the check. 
MAX 
What do you think you're doing? 
MR. BLUME 
I'm getting the - 
MAX 
No, you're not. 
The Waiter comes over. Max intercepts him: 
MAX 
I just wanted to thank you again for accommodating us. We only expected to be a party of three, but somebody invited himself along. I apologize. 
WAITER 
That's perfectly all right. 
The waiter walks away. Miss Cross frowns. 
MISS CROSS 
You're being rude, Max. 
MAX 
No I'm not. I'm just trying to figure out why you brought this gentleman to my play. And my dinner, which was invitation only. 
John reaches in front of Max for the butter. Max grabs his spoon and swats John on the back of the hand. 
MAX 
Would you like me to pass you the butter? 
Max hands John the butter. 
MISS CROSS 
What's wrong with you? 
MAX 
(raising his voice) 
What's wrong with YOU? 
Max is making a scene. People all over the restaurant are watching. Max stares at Miss Cross. 
MAX 
You hurt my feelings. This night was important to me. 
MISS CROSS 
How did I hurt your feelings? 
MAX 
I wrote a hit play! 
(pause) 
And I'm in love with you. 
John looks to Miss Cross. She doesn't know what to say. Max looks drunk and dejected. 
MAX 
How do you like that, Curly? 
EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY 
Miss Cross and her pupils are out on the playground painting pictures. Each kid has an easel. 
Miss Cross sees Mr. Blume standing under a tree at the edge of the playground. He is wearing sunglasses and smoking a cigarette. He moves slightly behind the tree. She stares at him. 
He waves. She waves back. He comes over. 
MR. BLUME 
Hi. 
MISS CROSS 
Were you hiding over there? 
Mr. Blume shrugs. He points at one of the paintings. 
MR. BLUME 
What's that? 
The artist looks up at Mr. Blume. He is a small boy with jet- black curly hair and piercing eyes. 
ARTIST 
(makes a swimming gesture) 
It's a little swimming snake. 
Mr. Blume nods. 
MISS CROSS 
What can I do for you, Mr. Blume? 
Mr. Blume turns to Miss Cross and takes off his sunglasses. Silence. 
MR. BLUME 
Max wants to see you. 
MISS CROSS 
She's not here. 
MAX 
Well, see if she's in her classroom. 
The Contractor walks over to Max. 
CONTRACTOR 
Should we go ahead and take care of this tree? 
MAX 
Let's wait a few minutes. 
Coach Beck goes over to Max. He is six four and wears a John Newcombe mustache and an Adidas warm-up. He is frowning. 
COACH BECK 
What's going on here, Maxie? 
MAX 
Coach Beck. Good to see you. This is where they're building the new aquarium. I'm in charge of the committee, if you can believe it. 
COACH BECK 
This is the baseball diamond. 
MAX 
I believe it's being relocated a few feet over. 
COACH BECK 
(frowns) 
I should've been informed about that. 
Coach Beck walks off. Max answers some questions for the School Reporters. 
REPORTER 
Is it true the aquarium will have piranhas? 
MAX 
(smiles) 
Where'd you hear that? 
REPORTER 
My source indicated that it was a possibility. 
MAX 
Yes, it's true. Excuse me, George. 
Dirk has returned. 
MAX 
What's the story? 
DIRK 
(a little wary) 
She has a substitute teacher today. 
MAX 
Why? 
DIRK 
She probably got sick. 
MAX 
(looks away) 
You know she's not sick. Give me the phone. 
Max dials on a cellular phone. 
MAX 
Hi, Janet. It's Max Fischer. 
Is Mr. Blume there? 
(pause) 
Well, where is he? 
(pause) 
Goddammit, he's supposed to be here. 
Let me know if you find him, please. 
Max hangs up. He looks off and says in a steely voice: 
MAX 
I'm going anyway. 
Max goes over to the contractor. 
MAX 
Chop it down, Mr. Chandler! We've got an aquarium to build. 
Max talks to another reporter. 
MAX 
I don't give a shit about barracudas. But fuck it. I'm building it anyway. 
The sound of power saws fills the air as Dr. Guggenheim appears at the edge of the lot with Coach Beck and a Security Guard with a walkie-talkie. DR Guggenheim screams: 
DR. GUGGENHEIM 
Max! 
DR. Guggenheim sees the chopped-down trees and mangles baseball field as he strides on to the lot. 
MAX 
Nice to see you, Dr. Gugg- 
DR. GUGGENHEIM 
Max! 
(seizing Max by the arm) 
What do you think you're doing? 
MAX 
Terrible. Tell me something. When you talk to Miss Cross the other 
day, did you get the feeling- 
The hall monitor Mr. Holstead comes down the hall toward Max. He is a big, sturdy man about fifty years old. He wears a striped tie and his sleeves rolled up. 
MR HOLSTEAD 
(loudly) 
Do you have a telephone pass? 
Max holds up his hand for Mr. Holstead to wait a minute. He covers his ear so he can hear Mr. Blume. 
Mr. Blume is looking in the windows of different classrooms. Kids look out at him curiously. 
MR. BLUME 
I got to tell you, Max. I don't know what you see in her. I don't think she's right for you. 
MAX 
What's that supposed to mean? 
Mr. Blume sees Miss Cross inside teaching her class. He stares at her in a glance. He whispers: 
MR. BLUME 
Well, she's not that beautiful. She's not that interesting. I mean, sure, there's something about her. But I see you with someone- 
MAX 
Look, Mr. Blume. Your comments are valuable, but let's get to the point. Will she see me again? Yes or no? 
MR. BLUME 
(pause) 
No. 
MAX 
I'm going to go see her. Hang on. 
Max looks to Mr. Holstead. 
MAX 
I'm talking on the telephone. 
Mr. Holstead reaches over and hangs up the phone. 
MAX 
Come on, man. That's rude. 
INT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Mrs. Whitney watches from her classroom window at: 
Max opens a red metal door on to the empty concrete courtyard. He looks left and right. He sneaks across the courtyard to the bike racks, quickly unlocks his bike, and rides away. 
EXT. RUSHMORE - DAY 
Max rides full speed through the gates on to the Rushmore campus. He flips one leg off his bike and glides in toward the bike racks standing on one pedal. 
Max locks up his bike and walks across the lawn. 
MAGNUS 
You better beat it, laddie. 
Max looks up at Magnus Buchan sitting in a tree smoking a cigarette, hacking at a branch with a pocketknife. 
MAX 
I hope you fall out of that tree and get stick in the ass, Buchan. 
MAGNUS 
You know, I've watched you, Fischer. Showboat, always talking, picking a kid like Dirk cause his mother's a great piece and then getting nowhere. Like everything you do. Big show. No results. 
MAX 
And what do you call getting a hand job from Mrs. Calloway in her Jaguar? 
MAGNUS 
A bloody lie. 
MAX 
You think I got kicked out for just the aquarium? Nah. That ain't it. It was the hand job. And I'll tell you another thing. It was worth it. So eat your heard out, mick. I got business to attend to. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY 
Miss Cross comes out the door of the lower school with a basket of books and papers. She stops in front of her wagon and digs in her bag for the keys. 
MAX 
Or do you want me to go? 
MISS CROSS 
(looks around, sighs) 
You can talk to me. 
Miss Cross goes over to him. She stops a few feet away and they stand there in silence. 
MAX 
I'm sorry I embarrassed you at dinner. 
MISS CROSS 
That's OK. 
MAX 
No, it's not. And please apologize to what's his name for me. 
MISS CROSS 
I will. Are you OK? 
MAX 
I'm fine. But I miss Rushmore. I miss the seasons. And watching the leaves change. 
MISS CROSS 
But it's only three blocks away. 
MAX 
I know. I miss seeing you. 
MISS CROSS 
(pause) 
I miss you, too. 
You'd take time out of your business to do that? 
MR. BLUME 
Business schmizness. 
OCTOBER MONTAGE: 
Max and Miss Cross ride in the backseat of a van full of first graders. Max is telling a story and everyone is laughing. Mr. Blume is up front quietly driving the van. One of the first graders sits in the passenger seat staring at him. They go through the front gates of the zoo. 
Miss Cross stands at the front of her classroom drawing a complicated geometric proof on the chalkboard. Max sits alone across from her nodding earnestly and taking notes. 
Max and Miss Cross play doubles against Mr. Blume and Dirk on the court in the Blume's backyard. Max coaches Miss Cross on her backhand. Mr. Blume watches her from across the net. Mrs. Blume watches all of them from an upstairs window. 
The Grover Cleveland Science Fair. Max sits proudly in front of his project. It is a paper mache tidal wave looming over a little coastal village with screaming peasants. 
Margaret Yang is across the aisle being photographed with a trophy for Best of Show. Her project is called Light, Color, Sound and Magnetism. She is staring at Max, but he doesn't notice her. 
Mrs. Whitney hands Max a geometry test. It has a C+ on it. Max looks quickly to Mrs. Whitney, surprised. She smiles and shakes his hand. 
A huge banner for the Grover Cleveland Owls is stretched across the endzone of the football field. Max, dressed in a shiny blue and grey jumpsuit, bursts through the banner and onto the field doing cartwheels and flips. The football teams scrambles out behind him. 
Max points out to different parts of the crows and yells football cheers. Dirk is sitting in between Mr. Blume and Miss Cross in the stands. Mr. Blume stares at Miss Cross. Miss Cross looks back and Mr. Blume and smiles. Dirk says significantly: 
DIRK 
Where's Mrs. Blume tonight, Mr. Blume? 
And your sons Ronny and Donny? 
MR. BLUME 
I haven't the slightest idea, Dirk. 
INT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. DAY 
Max burst through a doorway followed by a little ENTOURAGE of underclassmen that includes a sophomore named WOODY. Woody has long hair and a Led-Zepplin shirt. He is carrying a clipboard. 
They go down the hallway and quickly pass Margaret Yang. She is very nicely dressed in a grey turtleneck. 
MARGARET 
Hi, Max. 
MAX 
Hi. 
Max keeps walking. 
He stops. He turns back to Margaret Yang. He looks her up and down. She is slightly uneasy. Max looks to Woody. Woody shrugs. Max looks back to Margaret. 
MAX 
What was your name again? 
MARGARET 
Margaret Yang. 
MAX 
Are you free seventh period? 
MARGARET 
Well, I'm supposed to have guitar lessons. 
MAX 
(pause) 
Classical? 
MARGARET 
Rock. 
MAX 
You can get out of it. 
(to Woody) 
put Margaret down for 3:30 in the auditorium, Woody. 
Max turns away and walks briskly down the hall with his entourage. He calls back to Margaret: 
MAX 
And bring a headshot. 
EXT. MISS CROSS' HOUSE. DAY 
A nice two story house with a wide lawn and lots of trees. Mr. Blume knocks on the front door and waits nervously. He looks around the yard with his hands in his pockets. 
The door opens. Miss Cross is holding a plate of sliced carrots. She looks at Mr. Blume curiously and smiles. 
MISS CROSS 
Hi, Herman. 
MR. BLUME 
How are you, Rosemary? 
MISS CROSS 
Fine, thanks. I just got home and I'm having a little snack. 
MR. BLUME 
Having some carrots. 
Miss Cross nods. Mr. Blume looks up at the house. 
MR. BLUME 
Nice house. 
MISS CROSS 
Yeah, This isn't mine. I'm' just kind of housesitting. 
(pause) 
Were you in the neighborhood? 
Mr. Blume nods. There is an awkward silence. 
MR. BLUME 
Didn't Max have anything planned for us today? A trip to the museum or something? 
MISS CROSS 
Did he? I thought he was rehearsing this evening. 
MR. BLUME 
Oh. That's right. His new play. He's going to be in this one, isn't he? 
Miss Cross nods. Mr. Blume shakes his head. 
DIRK 
Who sold you that crock? 
MAGNUS 
He told me himself. He says she gave him a hand job in the backseat of her bloody Jaguar. 
DIRK 
Max would never say that. 
MAGNUS 
(smiles) 
Yeah. You're probably right. After all, the son of a brain doctor doesn't need to impress anybody. 
Buchan laughs wickedly and fires off another throwing star. 
INT. GROVE CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. NIGHT 
The school auditorium . Max is onstage dressed as a South Central lowrider called Little Juan. He is opposite a senior named 40 OUNCE and Margaret Yang, who plays Blue Eyes. While they are rehearsing the scene a MESSENGER comes in with an envelope for Max. 
LITTLE JUAN 
The killing has got to stop, esse. It's getting too loco. No more gats. 
40 OUNCE 
Nigger, you're the crazy one. Motherfuckers be wanting to kill you. Are you talking about getting rid of your gun? 
LITTLE JUAN 
It's time, homey. 
BLUE EYES 
Kiss me, Little Juan. 
MAX 
(suddenly out of character) 
Then he kisses her and we're out. OK. 
(pointing to the messenger) 
Is that for me? 
The messenger gives Max the envelope. Max opens it. 
INSERT LETTER: 
Written neatly in blue crayon on paper torn from a spiral notebook. Dirk reads in VOICEOVER dripping with sarcasm. 
Dear Max, 
I'm sorry to say that I have secretly found out that Mr. Blume is having an affair with Miss Cross. My first suspicions came when I saw them frenching at the museum, and then I knew for sure when they went skinny dipping in Mr. Blume's swimming pool, giving each other hand jobs while you were taking a nap on the front porch. Why am I telling you this now? Because you're such a good friend. Take care, pal. 
Fondly, 
Dirk Calloway 
EXT. MISS CROSS' HOUSE. NIGHT 
Mr. Blume puts on his jacket as he walks down the front path from Miss Cross' house. He gets in his Bentley and starts the engine. He looks in the rearview mirror and sees the glowing red tip of a cigarette. He wheels around fast. 
Max is sitting in the backseat smoking a cigarette. 
BLUME 
Max! 
MAX 
How was she, Herman? 
BLUME 
Jesus Christ! 
MAX 
Was she good? I bet she was. Although I wouldn't know cause I never screwed her. 
Blume flicks on the lights. Max has tears all over his face. 
MAX 
(with bitter contempt) 
Going skinny-dipping while I took a nap. Are you comfortable, Max? I'll just be out nude getting hand jobs from the woman you love. 
MR. BLUME 
(frowns) 
We never went skipping dipping. 
MAX 
Sure, you didn't. And next you're going to tell me you didn't just walk out of her house at two o'clock in the morning. 
MR. BLUME 
(pause) 
I'm in love with her. 
MAX 
Well, I was in love with her first. And all that crap about, I don't think she's that great, I don't think she's right for you, Max. That was all bullshit, wasn't it? 
Silence. 
MAX 
Do you think she's in love with you? 
MR. BLUME 
I don't know. 
MAX 
Well, I guarantee you she's not. 
And she never will be. 
MR. BLUME 
Look, Max - 
MAX 
I saved Latin! 
Max glares at Mr. Blume. He shakes his head. 
MAX 
What'd you ever do? 
MAX 
I have no reason to want to hurt you. 
MRS. BLUME 
Then you're trying to hurt Herman. 
MAX 
That's correct. 
INT. THE BILBY-FLICKENGER HOTEL. NIGHT 
The vast lobby of the Bilby-Flickenger. Mr. Blume is leaning against the counter at the front desk. His luggage fills up two carts behind him. A faint smile plays across his lips as he stares off into space. The CONCIERGE is checking him in. 
CONCIERGE 
And how long will you be staying with us, Mr. Blume? 
MR. BLUME 
Indefinitely. I'm getting a divorce. 
CONCIERGE 
(typing away) 
Very good, sir. 
Mr. Blume yells to the BELLMAN. 
MR. BLUME 
Yo! 
The bellman looks up. Mr. Blume waves. The bellman waves back. The concierge gives Mr. Blume his room key. 
CONCIERGE 
Here you are Mr. Blume. Charles will show you to your room. 
MR. BLUME 
Wonderful. Where's the pool, by the way? I might want to take a dip before dinner. 
CONCIERGE 
It's on the roof, sir. 
MR. BLUME 
Terrific! 
Mr. Blume gets on the elevator with the bellman. The bellman looks at him and smiles. 
BELLMAN 
You certainly seem happy today, sir. 
MR. BLUME 
You bet your little ass I am, shorty. I lost my family. But I gained a woman I love. 
BELLMAN 
Not a bad tradeoff. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM. DAY 
The living room of Mr. Blume's suite. Mr. Blume is dressed in a bathrobe with the Bilbly-Flickenger stitched on the pocket. He sits at his table having breakfast and reading the newspaper. There is a little basket in front of him with a jar of hone in it. A note attached to the jar says, "Enjoy your stay." 
A little bug flies around Mr. Blume's head. He swats it away and keeps reading. 
Two more bugs come buzzing around him. Mr. Blume looks up and frowns. They're bees. Mr. Blume slaps at his neck and jumps to his feet as he gets stung. 
MR. BLUME 
Shit! 
Bees are circling all over the room. Mr. Blume looks around frantically. He sees something at the bottom of the front door. It is a little plastic tube with bees crawling out of it and taking off. 
INT. BASEMENT. DAY 
Max comes out of the freight elevator wearing a red room service jacket with the Bilby-Flickenger stitched on the pocket. He has a wooden box with Rushmore Beekeepers stenciled on it. Max throws the jacket in a laundry cart and goes out the back door. 
EXT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. DAY 
Mr. Blume gets out of his car in the driveway at Grover Cleveland. He opens the trunk and takes out a set of steel cable cutters. He goes over to the bike racks and cuts the lock off Max's ten-speed. 
Mr. Blume lays the bicycle on the ground in front of his car and runs over it. Then he throws the car in reverse and goes over it again. He picks up the destroyed bicycle and takes it back to the bike racks and wraps the lock back around it. 
The small Indian groundskeeper we saw earlier on the roof is driving by in a Volkswagen Beetle. He frowns at Mr. Blume. Mr. Blume hurries back to his car. 
EXT. BLUME INTERNATIONAL CONCRETE. DAY 
The front gates of the concrete plant. Max rides up on an old grandmothers' bicycle with fenders and a handlebar basket. He's got a black duffel bag strapped to his back. 
Max waves to the SECURITY GUARD. The guard waves back: 
Max rides onto the lot and pulls over next to Mr. Blume's Bentley. He leans his bike against the car door. He unzips his duffel bag and slides underneath the car. 
EXT. RUSHMORE. DAY 
Mr. Blume pulls into the driveway to pick-up the twins from school. There is a lot of traffic and kids are running around everywhere. Mr. Blume taps the brakes. Nothing happens. He flies toward the back of a parked station wagon. 
He jerks the steering wheel and bounces up onto the sidewalk. The car pops through a wooden fence and rolls across the grass into the quadrangle. 
The Indian groundskeeper is raking leaves as the car goes past him. He watches as it crunches over some bushes and scrapes against a stone wall. It rolls to a stop in the middle of the quad. 
Mr. Blume gets out of the car and looks at the damage. He looks over at the white-haired Indian groundskeeper. 
The groundskeeper goes back to raking. 
EXT. PARKING LOT. DAY 
Kids watch from classrooms up and down the hall as Max is escorted away in handcuffs by the POLICE. Max has a hardened expression on his face. 
INT. POLICE STATION. DAY 
The county lock-up. Mr. Fischer watches through bulletproof glass as Max walks down a long, lonely corridor. 
The door buzzes open. Max comes into the waiting room. 
MAX 
Thanks for bailing me out, Dad. Can you drop me off at Rushmore? I got to go settle a score. 
MR. FISCHER 
(hesitates) 
You think that's wise, Max? 
MAX 
(angry) 
Dad. Please. Stay out of it. 
EXT. RUSHMORE. DAY 
Max walks into the quadrangle with cold expression on his face. It is Halloween and there is a jack-o-lantern on the steps. Lots of kids are dressed in costumes. 
You need any help? 
MISS CROSS 
No. I have it. 
She pricks her finger and holds it to her mouth. 
MISS CROSS 
Dammit. 
Max starts to go in the room to help her. 
MAX 
Here. Let me see. 
MISS CROSS 
No. Please, don't come in here. Look. I'm sorry I hurt you. I'm sorry I love your friend instead of you. But just. Please, Max. 
Miss Cross has tears in her eyes. Max goes slowly toward her. 
MAX 
You honestly believe you love Blume instead of me? 
MISS CROSS 
Yes. 
MAX 
You'll forgive me if I won't take your word for that. 
MISS CROSS 
Stop. If you don't stop with that ping-pong talk, I'm going to lose it. Do you understand me? 
Max takes Miss Cross' hand and kisses it. She pulls her and away. Max tries to embrace her. They struggle and Miss Cross overpowers Max. She holds his arms behind his back. 
MAX 
Let me go! 
Max struggles some more. Miss Cross pushes him hard across the room. Max smashes into some chairs and knocks over a desk. He yells at her: 
MAX 
I got kicked out because of you! 
MISS CROSS 
You got kicked out because - 
MAX 
Rushmore was my life. Now you are! 
MISS CROSS 
That's bullshit! 
Silence. 
MISS CROSS 
What do you really think is going to happen between us? You think we're going to have sex? 
Max looks shocked. 
MAX 
That's kind of a cheap way to put it, don't you think? 
MISS CROSS 
(pause) 
Not if you've never fucked before, it isn't. 
MAX 
(stunned) 
Oh, my God. 
MISS CROSS 
How would you put it to your friends? Do you want to finger me? Or maybe I could give you a hand job in the back of a Jaguar. Would that put an end to all of this? 
Miss Cross moves towards Max with her hand outstretched. Max retreats backwards, banging into desks and chairs. Miss Cross stops. 
MISS CROSS 
Please. Get out of my room. 
Max walks out of the room and stands in the doorway. 
Miss Cross turns away and goes back to taking down her maps from the wall. Max watches her for a minute. 
Max leaves. 
EXT. QUADRANLGE. DAY 
Max comes out the door of the lower school in a daze. Magnus Buchan is sitting on a bench eating some candy. He is wearing the uniform of the Green Beret. He sees Max and laughs. 
MAGNUS 
Fischer, ya spotty fucker! 
MAX 
Hello, Magnus. 
MAGNUS 
Got any hand jobs lately? 
MAX 
No, I haven't. 
Dirk appears with some of his friends. 
MAGNUS 
Hey, Dirk! Look who's here. Your stepfather! Waitin' for your mum so he can get a piece. 
Dirk is very embarrassed. He frowns and looks at the ground. Max stares at Magnus with bitter contempt. 
MAX 
Your mind is as warped as your ear, Buchan. 
MAGNUS 
(standing up) 
Don't get nasty, brother. 
Max breaks into a sprint straight at Magnus. 
MR. BLUME 
I wouldn't know. 
MAX 
Why not? 
MR. BLUME 
Because I haven't seen her in six weeks. 
MAX 
(frowns) 
What happened? 
Mr. Blume shrugs. 
MAX 
She left you? 
Mr. Blume nods. 
MAX 
How come? I thought she loved you. 
MR. BLUME 
So did I. I guess maybe I am too old for her after all. 
MAX 
(sadly) 
Maybe so. Maybe so. 
MR. BLUME 
She's still in love with the dead guy, anyway. 
MAX 
You mean Edward Appleby. 
MR. BLUME 
Oh, yeah. She's fucked up. 
Mr. Blume lights a new cigarette. Max points to Mr. Blume's first cigarette, balanced on the handrail. 
MAX 
You've already got one going, Mr. Blume. 
Mr. Blume picks up his first cigarette and puts it in the opposite corner of his mouth from the second. He smiles at Max through the smoke. They get off to the 14th floor and the doors open. 
MR. BLUME 
Adios, amigo. 
Max waves good-bye. But Mr. Blume does not get off the elevator. He bends over and puts his hands on his knees and takes a series of deep breaths. The door starts to close. He reaches out and holds them open. Max looks concerned. 
MAX 
Are you OK? 
Mr. Blume looks up at Max. He laughs and shakes his head. 
MR. BLUME 
I'm kind of lonely these days. 
Mr. Blume sighs. He gets off the elevator. The doors close behind him as Max watches him walk down the hall. 
CUT TO DIRK'S BINOCULARS: 
Max comes out of the hospital and stands quietly in the cold for a minute. He gets on his mother's old bicycle. He rides off down the street. 
EXT. THE FISCHERS' HOUSE. DAY 
Max opens the Fischer's garage door. His smashed-up ten-speed hangs from a peg on the wall. He takes is down and carries it out off the garage. 
INT. MISS CROSS' HOUSE. NIGHT 
Miss Cross is sitting up in her bed reading Treasure Island and listening to the radio. She is wearing pale blue pajamas. There is a knock on her windowpane. She looks up. 
She hears someone trying to open the window. She gets up and pulls open the blinds. Max is outside on the roof wearing his parka and ski cap in the falling snow. He waves. 
MISS CROSS 
Max! 
Miss Cross opens the window. 
MISS CROSS 
What are you doing here? 
MAX 
(dazed) 
I don't know. Jesus. They came at me out of no where. It was - 
MISS CROSS 
What? 
MAX 
So sudden. I just - 
(pause) 
I'm sorry. Can I use your phone? I just got hit by a car. 
Max points down at his destroyed ten-speed in the street under a street lamp. Parts are scattered all around it. 
MISS CROSS 
Oh, my God. Are you OK? 
MAX 
(disoriented) 
What? 
Miss Cross notices a little cut over Max's eye. She lifts up the front of Max's ski cap. There is blood all over his forehead. She looks shocked. 
MISS CROSS 
Come inside. 
MAX 
(climbing in) 
Thank you. 
She got cancer. 
Miss Cross nods. She sighs. 
MISS CROSS 
Lie still for a minute, OK? 
MAX 
OK. 
Miss Cross pushes Max's hair back with her hand. She looks at him for a minute. She touches the blood on his forehead with a cotton ball. She stops. 
MISS CROSS 
Is this fake blood? 
MAX 
(pause) 
Yes, it is. 
MISS CROSS 
You know, you and Herman deserve each other. You're little children. Let me show you to the door. 
Max gets up and goes over to the window. He climbs out onto the roof. He looks back to Miss Cross. 
MAX 
That wasn't a very satisfying conversation. 
Miss Cross shrugs. Silence. 
MAX 
All right. Goodbye, Miss Cross. 
MISS CROSS 
Goodbye, Max. 
Max disappears into the darkness. 
EXT. FROZEN POND. DAY 
A few ICE SKATERS race around and do figure-8's on the little frozen pond at the edge of town. Dirk is sitting on his tackle box, fishing from a hole in the ice. He stomps his feet, and even with his mittens on he has to blow into his hands to keep warm. 
Max sits with his bare hands resting on the ice. 
MAX 
People hate me. 
DIRK 
That's not true. 
MAX 
Guggenheim tried to spit on me. 
Poor old guy couldn't even spit. 
And Blume and Cross? 
(shakes his head) 
They can't stand me. 
I ruined their whole relationship. 
Dirk looks down at Max's red hands. 
DIRK 
You should put your mittens on. 
MAX 
(absently) 
Oh. They're already numb. I'm surprised you don't spit on me, Dirk. 
DIRK 
You're my friend, Max. 
Tear's starts streaming down Max's face. Dirk looks worried. 
MAX 
I'm sorry about what I said about your mother giving me a hand job. I just -- 
DIRK 
I know, Max. Listen. I'm sorry I didn't take your hand when Buchan kicked your ass. 
MAX 
(pause) 
I got a few licks in. At the very least, he'll think twice about spreading that kind of garbage. 
DIRK 
You should stand up. 
MAX 
I'm awfully comfortable. 
Silence. One of the skaters begins to circle around Max and Dirk closer and closer. She suddenly scratches to a halt right in front of them. 
The skater is a girl in white skates and grey tights and a short camel's hair coat. She has a scarf over the lower half of her face. She says to Max: 
SKATER 
Is this your handwriting? 
She holds out a little piece of paper torn out from a spiral notebook. Max stands up and takes it. There is a note written on it in blue crayon. 
INSERT PIECE OF PAPER: 
Please come to the frozen pond at 3:30 PM this afternoon. Thank you very much. 
Max looks to Dirk. Dirk is putting a new worm on his hook. 
MAX 
No. But it looks familiar. 
Max gives the piece of paper back to the girl. She lowers her scarf and we see she is Margaret Yang. 
MAX 
Do you know Dirk Calloway? 
MARGARET 
I don't think so. 
I'll see you at 3:15. 
Max starts walking away down the sidewalk. 
DIRK 
Where you going? 
MAX 
9without stopping) 
Rushmore. I got one last piece of unfinished business I got to attend to. 
EXT. RUSHMORE. DAY 
Max pumps his pellet gun shot about twenty times. He raises the stock to his shoulder as Magnus Buchan walks onto the quadrangle. He draws a bead on him and follows him in his sight as he passes be. He fires. 
Magnus screams and grabs his only good ear. He spins around and sees Max cocking a pellet gun. 
MAGNUS 
Fischer! Ya fuck! 
MAX 
Hello, Magnus. I'd have shot you in the other ear, but it got blown off a long time ago. 
Magnus starts to come at Max. Max points his weapon at him. 
MAX 
Not so fast. 
Magnus stops. 
MAX 
I owed you that one. Now we're even. 
MAGNUS 
(smiles crookedly) 
Not for long, kemosabe. 
MAX 
(shrugs) 
We'll see. 
Silence. Max holds Magnus at gunpoint. 
MAX 
I got a proposition for you. 
MAGNUS 
Shove it up your mother's arse, ya little prick. 
MAX 
I've got to hand it to you, Magnus. You've got a way with words. You want to be in a play? 
MAGNUS 
(puzzled) 
Don't piss with me, Fischer. 
MAX 
I'm not pissing with you. 
(reaching in his backpack) 
I brought you a script. 
Max hands Magnus a script with a red cover. 
MAGNUS 
What's all this shite? 
MAX 
Nothing. I just think you're right for the part. 
Magnus stares at Max. He says quietly: 
MAGNUS 
I always wanted to be in one of those frickin' plays of yours. 
MAX 
I know you did, mate. 
Magnus looks at the script. 
INSERT COVER OF PLAY: 
HEAVEN AND HELL 
a new play by Max Fischer 
revised draft 
Dramatists Guild registered 
INT. GROVER CLEVELAND HIGH SCHOOL. NIGHT 
The school auditorium. 
We see many familiar faces in the audience: Mr. Fischer, Dr. Guggenheim in his wheelchair, Mrs. Guggenheim, Mrs. Calloway, Mrs. Whitney, the Indian groundskeeper, the yearbook photographer, Coach Beck, Ernie, Mr. Holstead, Mr. Adams, the police who arrested Max, some old men from the barbershop. They are all dressed nicely in evening clothes. 
Miss Cross' friend John, whom Max humiliated at dinner after the Serpico play, is seated in the third row. He is dressed in a coat and tie. 
An USHER directs Miss cross to her seat. She is surprised to see that it is right nest to Mr. Blume's. She reluctantly sits down beside him. Mr. Blume sees her. 
MISS CROSS 
Hi, Herman. 
Mr. Blume nods. He pulls his ticket out of his inside pocket and checks the seat number. He looks to Miss Cross. Miss Cross smiles. 
MISS CROSS 
Looks like Max pulled a fast one on us. 
Mr. Blume nods. 
MISS CROSS 
How's your aquarium coming along? 
MR. BLUME 
Not too bad. It should be finished in October. 
Miss Cross nods. 
MAGNUS 
Tag 'em and bag 'em, cherries! We're moving out! Let's DD! 
Max throws down his rifle into a foxhole and begins to cry quietly. Someone moves slowly toward him out of the settling smoke. Max wheels around and whips out his Swiss Army knife. 
But then he sees it is Margaret Yang as a Vietnamese villager. She has been through hell. 
MARGARET 
Hello, Esposito. 
Max drops his knife and it stabs into the floor. He puts out his hand. Margaret takes it. He pulls her in and hugs her. 
Miss Cross smiles sadly. 
Max looks into Margaret Yang's eyes. 
MAX 
Will you marry me, Le-Chahn? 
MARGARET 
(instantly) 
You bet I will. 
Wagner's Flight of the Walkyries begins to play loudly from behind the stage as Max kisses Margaret and the curtain drops to wild applause. 
Mrs. Guggenheim looks on in amazement as Dr. Guggenheim stands up out of his wheelchair and leads the ovation. The rest of the audience quickly follows suit. 
The Indian groundskeeper is laughing hysterically. 
INT. GYMNASIUM. NIGHT 
The gymnasium has been filled with palm trees and decorated like an Army barracks. Flares burn in circles around the tables. A banner at the entrance says The Heaven and Hell Cotillion. 
Dirk and a couple of his CLASSMATES are looking at some vintage Playboy centerfolds taped-up on the wall as part of the Army barracks motif. 
Miss Cross and John are talking at the punchbowl. 
MISS CROSS 
Max sent you an invitation? 
JOHN 
Yeah. And he told me to wear a tie. 
Max and Margaret are drinking ginger ales and chatting with Mr. Fischer and MR. and MRS. YANG. 
MAX 
Thank you, Mrs. Yang. I actually wrote a different version of the play two years ago. But I couldn't get it done over at Rushmore. 
MRS. YANG 
Why? Too political? 
MAX 
No. A kid got his finger blown off during rehearsals. 
Max sees Mr. Blume and Miss Cross approaching. 
MAX 
Miss Cross, this is my father Bert Fischer. He's a barber. 
(to Mr. Fischer) 
This is my friend Rosemary Cross. 
Mr. Fischer smiles as they shake hands. 
MR. FISCHER 
Hi, Rosemary. 
MISS CROSS 
Nice to finally meet you, Bert. 
MAX 
And, of course, you know Mr. Blume. I also want everyone to meet Mr. and Mrs. Yang. And this is Margaret. 
Miss Cross and Margaret smile at each other. 
MISS CROSS 
Hello, Margaret. 
MARGARET 
Hello, Miss Cross. 
The Indian groundskeeper is talking with Coach Beck and Mr. Blume's foreman, Ernie. 
COACH BECK 
I'm surprised they let him build a real campfire onstage. That's a safety hazard. 
ERNIE 
Well, last year he tried to raise piranhas. 
COACH BECK 
What'd you think of the play, Mr. Littlejeans? 
GROUNDSKEEPER 
Best play all year, man. 
Mr. Blume, Magnus Buchan, and the Rushmore yearbook photographer are having a conversation. 
MAGNUS 
Well, Fischer stepped on half of my bleedin' lines. 
MR. BLUME 
Really? I didn't notice. 
PHOTOGRAPHER 
Are Ronny and Donny having a good time at military school? 
MR. BLUME 
(instantly) 
They love it. 
MAGNUS 
Lucky bastards. 
Mr. Fischer is talking with John. 
JOHN

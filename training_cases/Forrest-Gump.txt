Based on a novel by 
Winston Groom 
EXT. A SAVANNAH STREET - DAY (1981) 
A feather floats through the air. The falling feather. 
A city, Savannah, is revealed in the background. The feather floats down toward the city below. The feather drops down toward the street below, as people walk past and cars drive by, and nearly lands on a man's shoulder. 
He walks across the street, causing the feather to be whisked back on its journey. The feather floats above a stopped car. The car drives off right as the feather floats down toward the street. 
The feather floats under a passing car, then is sent flying back up in the air. A MAN sits on a bus bench. The feather floats above the ground and finally lands on the man's mudsoaked shoe. 
The man reached down and picks up the feather. His name is FORREST GUMP. He looks at the feather oddly, moves aside a box of chocolates from an old suitcase, then opens the case. 
Inside the old suitcase are an assortment of clothes, a pingpong paddle, toothpaste and other personal items. 
Forrest pulls out a book titled "Curious George," then places the feather inside the book. Forrest closes the suitcase. 
Something in his eyes reveals that Forrest may not be all there. 
Forrest looks right as the sound of an arriving bus is heard. 
A bus pulls up. Forrest remains on the bus bench as the bus continues on. 
A BLACK WOMAN in a nurse's outfit steps up and sits down at the bus bench next to Forrest. The nurse begins to read a magazine as Forrest looks at her. 
FORREST Hello. My name's Forrest Gump. 
He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse. 
FORREST You want a chocolate? 
The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this strange man next to her. 
FORREST I could eat about a million and a half of these. My momma always said, "Life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get." 
Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's shoes. 
FORREST Those must be comfortable shoes. I'll bet you could walk all day in shoes like that and not feel a thing. I wish I had shoes like that. 
BLACK WOMAN My feet hurt. 
FORREST Momma always says there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their shoes. Where they're going. Where they've been. 
The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his own shoes. 
FORREST I've worn lots of shoes. I bet if I think about it real hard I could remember my first pair of shoes. 
Forrest closes his eyes tightly. 
FORREST Momma said they'd take my anywhere. 
INT. COUNTRY DOCTOR'S OFFICE - GREENBOW, ALABAMA - DAY 
A little boy closes his eyes tightly. It is young Forrest as he sits in a doctor's office.

DOCTOR All right, Forrest, you can open your eyes now. Let's take a little walk around. 
The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS. GUMP, watches him as he clanks around the room awkwardly. 
DOCTOR How do those feel? His legs are strong, Mrs. Gump. As strong as I've ever seen. But his back is as crooked as a politician. 
Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump. 
DOCTOR But we're gonna straighten him right up now, won't we, Forrest? 
A loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls. 
MRS. GUMP Forrest!

BUBBA This way, we don't have to sleep with our heads in the mud. You know why we a good partnership, Forrest? 'Cause we be watchin' out for one another. Like brothers and stuff. Hey, Forrest, there's somethin' I've been thinkin' about. I got a very important question to ask you. How would you like to go into the shrimpin' business with me? 
FORREST Okay. 
BUBBA Man, I tell you what, I got it all figured out, too. So many pounds of shrimp to pay off the boat, so many pounds for gas, we can just live right on the boat. We ain't got to pay no rent. I'll be the captain; we can just work it together. Split everything right down the middle. Man, I'm tellin' you, fifty-fifty. And, hey, Forrest, all the shrimp you can get. 
FORREST That's a fine idea. 
FORREST (V.O.) Bubba did have a fine idea. 
ANOTHER NIGHT - Some soldiers patrol the area. Forrest lies in a pup tent and writes a litter as the rain pours down. He uses his flashlight to see.

FORREST (V.O.) And how I was looking forward to getting a letter from her just as soon as she had the time I'd always let her know that I was okay. 
Forrest reaches down and picks up Tex from the ground. Forrest pulls Tex up over his shoulder, then runs. 
FORREST (V.O.) I couldn't just let him lay there all alone, scared the way he was, so I grabbed him up and run him out of there. 
Forrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing. 
He sets Tex down on the bank of a river, and runs back into the jungle. 
FORREST (V.O.) And every time I went back looking for Bubba, somebody else was saying, "Help me, Forrest. Help me."

Forrest grabs the third wounded soldier up from the ground and turns him over. It is DALLAS. 
DALLAS Can't hear... Can't hear... 
Dallas is dropped off at the bank next to the other wounded soldiers. Forrest turns to go back to the jungle. 
2ND WOUNDED SOLDIER No sweat, man. Just lay back. You're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. 
FORREST (V.O.) I started to get scared that I might never find Bubba. 
STRONGARM (over radio) You're danger close for crack air, over. 
Forrest trips over something and falls to the ground. He looks up to find two bloody legs. It is Lt. Dan, who is wounded. He speaks into the radio.

Forrest pulls Lt. Dan over his shoulder and runs through the jungle. 
STRONGARM Leg Lima 6, Leg Lima 6. This is Strongarm, be advised, your fast movers are inbound at this time, over. 
FORREST (V.O.) Then it felt like something just jumped up and bit me. 
Forrest falls down. 
FORREST Ah, something bit me! 
Forrest gets up as Lt. Dan yells. Lt. Dan fires his pistol at the unseen enemy as Forrest pulls him away. 
LT. DAN You dink son-of-a-bitch! I can't leave the platoon! I told you to leave me there, Gump. Forget about me. Get yourself out! Did you hear what I said! Goddammit, pull me down! Get your ass out of here! 
Forrest drops Lt. Dan down at the bank, next to the other wounded soldiers. Lt. Dan grabs Forrest by the shirt, angry. 
LT. DAN I didn't ask you to pull me out of there, goddamn you! What the hell do you think you're going? 
FORREST To get Bubba. 
LT. DAN I got an air strike inbound right now. They're gonna nape the whole area. 
Forrest gets up and runs as Lt. Dan yells after him. 
LT. DAN Gump, you stay here, goddammit! That's an order! 
FORREST I gotta find Bubba! 
Forrest runs through the jungle searching for Bubba. Forrest slows down and looks around carefully. 
BUBBA Forrest... 
FORREST Bubba... 
Bubba looks up as he lies on the ground. 
BUBBA I'm okay. 
Bubba holds a palm frond over his wound. Forrest removes the frond to look at the wound. Bubba's chest has been blown open. 
FORREST Oh, Bubba, no... 
BUBBA Naw, I'm gonna be all right. 
Forrest looks around as he hear the voices of the enemy. 
FORREST Come on. Come on. Come here... 
Forrest carries Bubba through the jungle. The sound of approaching planes fills the air. 
BUBBA I'm okay, Forrest. I'm all right. 
The roar of approaching planes is deafening. Forrest looks up in fear. Three planes dive down toward the jungle. They fire napalm as the jungle explodes with massive fireballs. 
Forrest runs, carrying Bubba. The fireballs explode behind him. The entire jungle area is in flames as Forrest runs. 
ISABEL Christ, what'd they do with this? 
Forrest continues to speak into the microphone. The crowd grows restless. 
CROWD We can't hear you! We can't hear anything! 
HILARY This one! This one! Give me that! 
Hilary plugs in the right patch cord. 
HILARY That's it. 
FORREST ...and that's all I have to say about that. 
Forrest looks at the massive crowd. They are silent. Abbie Hoffman steps over to Forrest and pats him on the shoulder. 
ABBIE HOFFMAN That's so right on, man. You said it all. What's your name, man? 
FORREST My name is Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump. 
ABBIE HOFFMAN Forrest Gump! 
Abbie raises his fist into the air. Abbie steps away from Forrest. The crowd cheers. 
CROWD Forrest Gump! 
JENNY (screaming) Forrest! Forrest! 
Jenny wades out into the reflection pool and waves her hand into the air. Forrest recognizes her. 
FORREST Jenny! 
Forrest rushes off the stage as Jenny makes her way out into the pool. 
JENNY Forrest! 
Forrest jumps down into the crowd and runs. Jenny smiles as she tries to run through the water. The crowd parts as Forrest runs into the pool. Jenny rushes toward him.

Another Black Panther named MASAI grabs Forrest and pats him down. 
JENNY Hey man, he's cool. He's cool. He's one of us. He's one of us. 
MASAI Let me tell you about us. 
WESLEY Where the hell have you been? 
JENNY I ran into a friend. 
MASAI Our purpose here is to protect our black leaders from the racial onslaught of the pig who wishes to brutalize our black leaders, rape our women, and destroy our black communists. 
BLACK PANTHER Masai, phone. Talk to these guys. 
WESLEY Who's the baby killer? 
JENNY This is my good friend I told you about. This is Forrest Gump. Forrest, this is Wesley. Wesley and I live together in Berkeley, and he's the president of the Berkeley chapter of S.D.S. 
MASAI Let me tell you something else. 
WESLEY I want to talk to you. 
JENNY Okay, but... 
WESLEY No. Now! Goddammit! 
MASAI We are here to offer protection and help for all of those who need our help, because we, the Black Panthers, are against the war in Vietnam. Yes, we are against any war where black soldiers are sent to the front line to die for a country that hates them. Yes, we are against any war where black soldiers go to fight and come to be brutalized and killed in their own communities as they sleep in their beds at night. Yes, we are against all these racists and imperial dog acts. 
JENNY You are a fucking asshole! 
Wesley hits Jenny across the face. Slow motion -- Jenny falls back. Slow motion -- Forrest steps forward with rage. 
Slow motion -- Wesley turns and looks at Forrest. Forrest tackles Wesley and slams him onto a table. Jenny turns and looks as Masai pulls out a gun. 
JENNY Forrest! Quit it! Quit it! Forrest! Stop it! 
JENNY Forrest, I can't keep this. 
FORREST I got it just by doing what you told me to do.

Jenny gives Forrest the peace sign as the bus pulls away. The sign on the back of the bus reads "Berkeley to D.C." Forrest gives Jenny the peace sign. 
FORREST (V.O.) And just like that, she was gone out of my life again.

LT. DAN This is Cunning Carla, and Long-Limbs Lenore. 
Carla puts a "Happy New Year" crown on Lt. Dan's head. Lenore fixes her makeup. 
CARLA So where you been, baby-cakes, huh? Haven't seen you around lately. You know, you should have been here for Christmas 'cause Tommy bought a round on the house and gave everybody a turkey sandwich. 
LT. DAN Well, well, I had, uh, company. 
LENORE Hey, hey! We was, we was just there. That's at Times Square.

LENORE What are you, stupid or something? What's your problem? What's his problem? Did you lose your pecker in the war or something? 
CARLA What, is your friend stupid or something? 
LT. DAN What did you say? 
CARLA I said, is your friend stupid or something? 
LT. DAN Hey! Don't call him stupid! 
Lt. Dan throws Carla back onto the bed. 
CARLA Don't push me like that! 
LENORE Hey, don't you push her!

In the house are stacks of ping-pong paddles and life-sized cardboard cutouts of Forrest playing ping-pong. The name on the ping-pong paddles boxes reads: "Gump-Mao table tennis." 
MRS. GUMP We've had all sorts of visitors, Forrest. Everybody wants you to use their ping-pong stuff. One man even left a check for twenty-five thousand dollars if you'd be agreeable to saying you like using their paddle. 
FORREST Oh, Momma. I only like using my own paddle. Hi, Miss Louise. 
LOUISE Hey, Forrest. 
MRS. GUMP I know that. I know that. But it's twenty-five thousand dollars, Forrest. I thought maybe you could hold it for a while, see if it grows on you. Oh, you look good, Forrest. You look real good. 
FORREST (V.O.) That Momma, she sure was right. It's funny how things work out.

Forrest stands at the grave. 
FORREST Well, that's what's left after me saying, "When I was in China on the All-America Ping-Pong Team, I just loved playing ping-pong with my Flex- O-Ping-Pong Paddle." Which everybody knows it isn't true, but Momma says it's just a little white lie so it wouldn't hurt nobody. So, anyway, I'm putting all that on gas, ropes and new nets and a brand-new shrimpin' boat. 
EXT. BAYOU - DAY 
Forrest steers his shrimping boat. The boat is old and rusty. 
Forrest unleashes his nets as his catch of the day drops to the deck. It is a bunch of garbage and shells. Forrest picks up one shrimp.

FORREST (V.O.) I'd never named a boat before, but there was only one I could think of.

LT. DAN Come on! You call this a storm? 
Forrest slides back and forth as he attempts to steer the boat.

FORREST Yes, sir. We've got more money than Davy Crocket.

FORREST Hello, Jenny. 
FORREST (V.O.) Jenny came back and stayed with me. 
INT. GUMP HOUSE 
Jenny lies asleep in bed. 
FORREST (V.O.) Maybe it was because she had nowhere else to go. Or maybe it was because she was so tired, because she went to bed and slept and slept like she hadn't slept in years. It was wonderful having her home. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY 
Forrest and Jenny walking. 
FORREST (V.O.) Every day we'd take a walk, and I'd jabber on like a monkey in a tree. And she'd listen about ping-pong and shrimpin' boats and Momma makin' a trip to heaven. I did all the talkin'. Jenny most of the time was real quiet. 
FORREST ...big ol' gobs of rain and little bitty stinging rain and rain... 
Jenny's old house stands at the end of the dirt road. It appears to be deserted. Jenny walks toward the house and stops. She stares at the house. Forrest walks toward Jenny. 
Jenny suddenly heaves a rock angrily at the house. She throws other things at the house. 
JENNY How could you do this? 
She breaks a window. Jenny collapses to the ground and sobs.

Forrest steps into Jenny's bedroom. He carries a tray with breakfast on it. Forrest looks at Jenny as she sleeps. 
Slowly she wakes up and looks at Forrest. 
FORREST Hey. 
JENNY Hey. 
Forrest sets the tray down next to Jenny as she sits up in bed. Forrest opens a window, then sits down next to the bed. 
JENNY Hey, Forrest, were you scared in Vietnam? 
FORREST Yes. Well, I, I don't know. 
EXT. VIETNAM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT 
Forrest looks up into the sky as the rain stops. Forrest removes his helmet. The stars emerge from behind the clouds. 
FORREST (V.O.) Sometimes it would stop raining long enough for the stars to come out. And then it was nice. It was like just before the sun goes to bed down on the bayou... 
EXT. BAYOU - FLASHBACK - SUNSET 
Forrest stands on his boat and looks at a deep orange and red sunset. 
FORREST (V.O.) There was over a million sparkles on the water. Like that mountain lake. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN LAKE - FLASHBACK - DAY 
Forrest runs along a highway. A lake reflects the mountains and the sky. 
FORREST (V.O.) It was so clear, Jenny. It looks like there were two skies, one on top of the other. And then in the desert, when the sun comes up... 
EXT. DESERT - FLASHBACK - SUNRISE 
Forrest runs along a desert highway. The morning light casts an orange glow over the desert. 
FORREST (V.O.) I couldn't tell where heavens stopped and the earth began. It was so beautiful. 
INT. GUMP HOUSE - MORNING 
Forrest looks at Jenny. Jenny looks out the window. 
JENNY I wish I could have been there with you. 
FORREST You were. 
Jenny reaches over and takes Forrest's hand. 
JENNY I love you. 
FORREST (V.O.) You died on a Saturday morning. 
EXT. JENNY'S GRAVE AT OLD OAK TREE - DAY 
Forrest stands under the old oak tree where Jenny has been buried. 
FORREST And I had you placed here under our tree. 
Jenny's grave marker. Forrest tries to hold back his tears.

TAXI DRIVER 
by 
Paul Schrader 
PROPERTY OF: 
"The whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence." 
--Thomas Wolfe, "God's Lonely Man" 
TRAVIS BICKLE, age 26, lean, hard, the consummate loner. On the surface he appears good-looking, even handsome; he has a quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from nowhere, lighting up his whole face. But behind that smile, around his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the ominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness and loneliness. He seems to have wandered in from a land where it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants seldom speak. The head moves, the expression changes, but the eyes remain ever-fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space. 
Travis is now drifting in and out of the New York City night life, a dark shadow among darker shadows.  Not noticed, no reason to be noticed, Travis is one with his surroundings. He wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt and a worn beige Army jacket with a patch reading, "King Kong Company 1968-70". 
He has the smell of sex about him: Sick sex, repressed sex, lonely sex, but sex nonetheless. He is a raw male force, driving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. Then one looks closer and sees the evitable. The clock sprig cannot be wound continually tighter. As the earth moves toward the sun, Travis Bickle moves toward violence. 
FILM OPENS on EXT. of MANHATTAN CAB GARAGE.  Weather-beaten sign above driveway reads, "Taxi Enter Here". Yellow cabs scuttle in and out. It is WINTER, snow is piled on the curbs, the wind is howling. 
INSIDE GARAGE are parked row upon row of multi-colored taxis. Echoing SOUNDS of cabs idling, cabbies talking. Steamy breath and exhaust fill the air. 
INT. CORRIDOR of cab company offices. Lettering on ajar door reads: 
PERSONAL OFFICE 
Marvis Cab Company Blue and White Cab Co. Acme Taxi Dependable Taxi Services JRB Cab Company Speedo Taxi Service 
SOUND of office busywork: shuffling, typing, arguing. 
PERSONAL OFFICE is a cluttered disarray. Sheets with heading "Marvis, B&W, Acme" and so forth are tacked to crumbling plaster wall: It is March. Desk is cluttered with forms, reports and an old upright Royal typewriter. 
Dishelved middle-aged New Yorker looks up from the desk. We CUT IN to ongoing conversation between the middle-aged PERSONNEL OFFICER and a YOUNG MAN standing in front on his desk. 
The young man is TRAVIS BICKLE. He wears his jeans, boots and Army jacket. He takes a drag off his unfiltered cigarette. 
The PERSONNEL OFFICER is beat and exhausted: he arrives at work exhausted. TRAVIS is something else again. His intense steely gaze is enough to jar even the PERSONNEL OFFICER out of his workaday boredom. 
PERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.) No trouble with the Hack Bureau? 
TRAVIS (O.S.) No Sir. 
PERSONNEL OFFICER (O.S.) Got your license? 
TRAVIS (O.S.) Yes. 
PERSONNEL OFFICER So why do you want to be a taxi driver? 
TRAVIS I can't sleep nights. 
PERSONNEL OFFICER There's porno theatres for that. 
TRAVIS I know. I tried that. 
The PERSONNEL OFFICER, though officious, is mildly probing and curious.  TRAVIS is a cipher, cold and distant. He speaks as if his mind doesn't know what his mouth is saying. 
PERSONNEL OFFICER So whatja do now? 
TRAVIS I ride around nights mostly. Subways, buses. See things. Figur'd I might as well get paid for it. 
PERSONNEL OFFICER We don't need any misfits around here, son. 
A thin smile cracks almost indiscernibly across TRAVIS' lips. 
TRAVIS You kiddin? Who else would hack through South Bronx or Harlem at night? 
PERSONNEL OFFICER You want to work uptown nights? 
TRAVIS I'll work anywhere, anytime. I know I can't be choosy. 
PERSONNEL OFFICER (thinks a moment) How's your driving record? 
TRAVIS Clean. Real clean. (pause, thin smile) As clean as my conscience. 
TRAVIS (V.O.) It's a hustle, but it keeps me busy. I can take in three to three-fifty a week, more with skims. 
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT, now seated in back seat, speaks up: 
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT (urgent) Is Kennedy operating, cabbie? Is it grounded? 
On seat next to TRAVIS is half-eaten cheeseburger and order of french fries. He puts his cigarette down and gulps as he answers: 
TRAVIS Why should it be grounded? 
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT Listen - I mean I just saw the needle of the Empire State Building. You can't see it for the fog! 
TRAVIS Then it's a good guess it's grounded. 
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT The Empire State in fog means something, don't it? Do you know, or don't you? What is your number, cabbie? 
TRAVIS Have you tried the telephone? 
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT (hostile, impatient) There isn't time for that. In other words, you don't know. 
TRAVIS No. 
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT Well, you should know, damn it, or who else would know? Pull over right here. (points out window) Why don't you stick your goddamn head out of the goddamn window once in a while and find out about the goddamn fog! 
TRAVIS pulls to the curb. The BUSINESS MAN stuffs a dollar bill into the pay drawer and jumps out of the cab. He turns to hail another taxi. 
MAN IN BUSINESS SUIT Taxi! Taxi! 
Travis writes up his trip card and drives away. 
It is LATER THAT NIGHT. The rain has turned to drizzle. Travis drives trough another section of Manhattan. 
TRAVIS (V.O.) I work the whole city, up, down, don't make no difference to me - does to some. 
STREETSIDE: TRAVIS' P.O.V.  Black PROSTITUTE wearing white vinyl boots, leopard-skin mini-skirt and blond wig hails taxi. On her arm hangs half-drunk seedy EXECUTIVE TYPE. 
TRAVIS pulls over. 
PROSTITUTE and JOHN climb into back seat. TRAVIS checks out the action in rear view mirror. 
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD) Some won't take spooks - Hell, don't make no difference tom me. 
TRAVIS' taxi drives through Central Park. 
GRUNTS, GROANS coming from back seat. HOOKER and JOHN going at it in back seat. He's having a hard time and she's probably trying to get him to come off manually. 
JOHN (O.S.) Oh baby, baby. 
PROSTITUTE (O.S.) (forceful) Come on. 
TRAVIS stares blankly ahead. 
CUT TO: 
TRAVIS' APARTMENT.  CAMERA PANS SILENTLY across INT. room, indicating this is not a new scene. 
TRAVIS is sitting at plain table writing. He wears shirt, jeans, boots.  An unfiltered cigarette rests in a bent coffee can ash tray. 
CLOSE UP of notebook. It is a plain lined dimestore notebook and the words TRAVIS is writing with a stubby pencil are those he is saying.  The columns are straight, disciplined. Some of the writing is in pencil, some in ink. The handwriting is jagged. 
CAMERA continues to PAN, examining TRAVIS' apartment. It is unusual, to say the least: 
A ratty old mattress is thrown against one wall. The floor is littered with old newspapers, worn and unfolded streets maps and pornography.  The pornography is of the sort that looks cheap but costs $10 a threw - black and white photos of naked women tied and gagged with black leather straps and clothesline. There is no furniture other than the rickety chair and table. A beat-up portable TV rests on an upright melon crate. The red silk mass in another corner looks like a Vietnamese flag. Indecipherable words, figures, numbers are scribbled on the plain plaster walls. Ragged black wires dangle from the wall where the telephone once hung. 
TRAVIS (V.O.) They're all animals anyway. All the animals come out at night: Whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. (a beat) Someday a real rain will come and wash all this scum off the streets. 
It's EARLY MORNING: 6 a.m. The air is clean and fresh and the streets nearly deserted. 
EXT. of TAXI GARAGE.  TRAVIS' taxi pulls into the driveway. 
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD) Each night when I return the cab to the garage I have to clean the come off the back seat. Some nights I clean off the blood. 
INT. of TAXI GARAGE.  TRAVIS pulls his taxi into garage stall. TRAVIS reaches across the cab and extracts a small vial of bennies from the glove compartment. 
TRAVIS stands next to the cab, straightens his back, and tucks the bottle of pills into his jacket pocket. He lowers his head, looks into back seat, opens rear door and bends inside. 
The Headquarters of the "New Yorkers for Charles Palantine for President Committee", located at the corner of 50th Street and Broadway, are festooned in traditional red, white and blue banners, ribbons and signs. 
One large sign proclaims "Palantine". Another sign reads "Register for New York Primary, July 20.". The smiling middle-aged face of Charles Palantine keeps watch over the bustling pedestrians. 
It is LATE AFTERNOON. 
INSIDE HEADQUARTERS 
A variety of YOUNG WORKERS joke and chatter as they labor through stacks of papers. The room is pierced with the sound of ringing phones. 
Seen from a distance - the only way Travis can see them - those are America's chosen youth: Healthy, energetic, well- groomed, attractive, all recruited from the bucolic fields of Massachusetts and Connecticut. 
CAMERA FAVORS BETSY, about 25, an extremely attractive woman sitting at the reception desk between two phones and several stacks of papers. Her attractions, however, are more than skin deep. Beneath that Cover Girl facial there is a keen, though highly specialized sensibility: Her eyes scan every man who passes her desk as her mind computes his desirability: Political, intellectual, sexual, emotional, material.  Simple pose and status do not impress her; she seeks out the extraordinary qualities in men. She is, in other words, star-fucker of the highest order. 
Betsy, putting down the phone, calls TOM, a lanky, amiable and modishly long-haired campaign workder over to her desk: 
BETSY Tom. 
Tom is pleasant and good-looking, but lacks those special qualities which interest Betsy. He gets nowhere with Betsy - yet he keeps trying. 
Just another of those routine office flirtations which pass the hours and free the fantasies. 
BETSY Tom, come here a moment. (he walks over) I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county. (a beat) And don't forget to add the new photo releases. 
TOM The senator's white paper is almost ready, Bets. Should we wait for that? 
BETSY Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway. 
TOM I think we should try to get maximum coverage for this new mandatory welfare program. Push the issues. 
BETSY (as if instructing a child) First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man. 
TOM You forgot "sexy". 
BETSY No, I didn't forget "sexy". 
TOM Just didn't get around to it, huh? 
BETSY Oh, Tom, please. 
TOM Well, for Christsakes, you sound like you're selling... I don't know what... cars... not issues. 
BETSY Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings? 
TOM More people watch it. 
BETSY Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious, 
TOM No, c'mon, I'm listening. I was just... 
BETSY Just what? 
TOM Kidding around... you know, fun. 
Betsy looks toward the street, then back at Tom. 
BETSY Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere. 
TOM With who? 
BETSY Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it. 
Betsy's attention is being distracted by something she sees across the street. She puts on her glasses and looks out across the street again. 
TOM Well, if Cronkite's so great, why don't we run him instead? 
BETSY That's the last. The finish. Period. Some pople can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious---- 
TOM Sure we could run him. You realize he's already of his block association. 
BETSY (looks across street again) Have you been noticing anything strange? 
TOM No, why? 
BETSY Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us? 
Travis appears at the door. He has to push aside the JUNKIES to enter without making physical contact - something Travis would not relish. He may be repulsed with these people and this place, but he is too much a part of this to let his feelings rise to the surface. 
Wizard gives Travis a perfunctory wave. 
WIZARD Travis. 
TRAVIS Hey Wizard. 
Travis straddles a seat at the table. Dough-Boy gives Travis something between a wink and an eye-twitch saying: 
DOUGH-BOY Yeah, that's Blush-On. My wife uses it, 
WIZARD (ironic) Ask Travis. He's the ladies man. 
Travis shrugs and motions for a cup of coffee. 
WIZARD (continuing) Well, whatever the fuck it is, she used it. And then the spray perfume. You know, the real sweat kind - and, on top of that, get this, right when we're crossing the Tri- boro bridge - she changes her pantyhose! 
DOUGH-BOY No. 
Travis turns his head. He appears not to be interested, but is. 
WIZARD Yeah. 
DOUGH-BOY Could you see anything? 
WIZARD Well, she was trying to keep her skirt down, sort of, you know. But it was pretty obvious what she was doing. I mean, Christ, it was rush hour and the traffic's practically standing still. 
DOUGH-BOY What did you do? 
WIZARD Threw on the emergency, jumped the seat and fucked her brains out - What do you think! (they laugh) What do I have to do? Draw you a picture? 
DOUGH-BOY Yeah. 
WIZARD What was I supposed to do? I was watching in the rear view. You know, just checkin' traffic. (to Travis) So howsit? 
TRAVIS (w/o inflection) Some fleet driver for Bell just cut up. Just heard it on the radio. 
DOUGH-BOY Stick up? 
A WAITRESS brings Travis' coffee and a glass of water. He asks for a cheeseburger. 
WIZARD Sure. What do you think? She wanted to get out of the cab. I said "Look, you're in the middle of the fucking bridge..." 
DOUGH-BOY You said that? 
WIZARD Well, I said, "Lady, please, we're on a bridge..." 
DOUGH-BOY And what happened? 
Travis awaits Wizard's answer. 
WIZARD She stayed in the cab, what's she gonna do? but she stiffed me. A real skunk. 
DOUGH-BOY A real skunk. 
Wizard realizes Travis and Dough-Boy may not have met. 
WIZARD (paternal) Travis, you know Dough-Boy, Charlie T.? 
Charlie T. nods sleepily. Travis indicates he knows Dough-Boy. 
DOUGH-BOY Yeah. We went to Harvard together. (laughs) 
WIZARD We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey. 
DOUGH-BOY Look who's talking? (gestures around table) Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour? 
Travis sips his coffee. Charlie T.'s eyelids slip shut. 
WIZARD (to Travis) So howsit? 
TRAVIS (w/o inflection) Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up.  Just heard it on the radio. 
DOUGH-BOY Stick up? 
Betsy's conversation interrupts Travis' V.O.: 
BETSY We've signed up 15.000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering. 
TRAVIS I know what you mean. I've got the same problems. I just can't get things organized. Little things, I mean. Like my room, my possessions. I should get one of those signs that says, "One of these days I'm Gonna Organezizied". 
Travis contorts his mouth to match his mispronunciation, than breaks into a big, friendly, infectious grin. The very sight of it makes one's heart proud. 
Betsy cannot help but be caught up in Travis' gin. Travis' contagious, quicksilver moods cause: 
BETSY (laughing) Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before. 
TRAVIS I can believe that. 
BETSY Where do you live? 
TRAVIS (evasive) Oh, uptown. You know. Some joint. It ain't much. 
BETSY So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night? 
TRAVIS I had a regular job for a while, days. You know, doin' this, doin' that. But I didn't have anything to do at night. I got kinda lonely, you know, just wandering around. So I decided to works nights. It ain't good to be alone, you know. 
BETSY After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while. 
TRAVIS Yeah, well... (a beat) In a cab you get to meet people. You meet lotsa people. It's good for you. 
BETSY What kind of people? 
TRAVIS Just people people, you know. Just people. (a beat) Had a dead man once. 
BETSY Really? 
TRAVIS He'd been shot. I didn't know that. He just crawled into the back seat, said "West 45th Street" and conked out. 
BETSY What did you do? 
TRAVIS I shot the meter off, for one thing. I knew I wasn't goimg to get paid. Then I dropped him off at the cop shop. They took him. 
BETSY That's really something. 
TRAVIS Oh, you see lots of freaky stuff in a cab. Especially when the moon's out. 
BETSY The moon? 
TRAVIS The full moon. One night I had three or four weirdoes in a row and I looked up and, sure enough, there it was - the full moon. 
Betsy laughs. Travis continues: 
TRAVIS Oh, yeah. People will do anything in front of a taxi driver. I mean anything. People too cheap to rent a hotel room, people scoring dope, people shooting up, people who want to embarrass you. (a bitterness emerges) It's like you're not even there, not even a person. Nobody knows you. 
Betsy cuts Travis' bitterness short: 
BETSY Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis. 
TRAVIS I know. I could have picked you up. 
BETSY Huh? 
TRAVIS Late one night. About three. At the plaza. 
BETSY Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else. 
TRAVIS No. It was you. You had some manila folders and a pink bag from Saks. 
Betsy, realizing Travis remembers her precisely, scrambles for a polite rationale for her behavior: 
BETSY You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable. 
TRAVIS If it wasn't for a drunk I would have picked you up. He wanted to go to the DMZ. 
BETSY The DMZ? 
TRAVIS South Bronx. The worst. I tried to ditch him, but he was already in the cab, so I had to take him. That's the law. Otherwise I would have picked you up. 
BETSY That would have been quite a coincidence. 
The meter is activated: $.60 registers. Tick, tick, tick. A quick glance shows the woman is now seated. She says softly, "192 East 89".  We take off with another jolt. Cross back up 9th Ave, then cut through the park. 
We're zooming up 9th Ave - how many green lights can we string together? Somebody steps out to hail the cab, but quickly steps back again. The meter is up $.90. It'll be a $1.40 fare. 
Now through the park and we're almost there. Check the numbers - 134 - 140. End of the block. Fare=$1.40. 
Check back mirror - she's getting out two bills. Two quarters and a dime change. Tip'll be either.25 or .35. 
The tip comes back: 35 cents - good tip. Good lady. We take off again with a jolt. 
This is Travis' world: Dark side streets, garish glaring main streets, quick glances, quicker evaluations - a dozen instantaneous decisions a minute. Are these people, are these objects? 
EXT. TRAVIS' TAXI speed down darkened street. 
Travis lets off a fare and pulls into line at the Plaza. 
TRAVIS (V.O.) I called Betsy again at her office, and she said maybe we could go to a movie together after she gets off work tomorrow. That's my day off. At first she hesitated, but I called her again and she agreed. (pause) Betsy. Betsy what? I forgot to ask her last name again.  Damn. I've got to remember stuff like that. 
Travis' thoughts are with Betsy, as THREE MEN enter Travis' cab. He activates the meter and pulls off. 
MAN'S VOICE St. Regis Hotel. 
Travis checks the mirror. Scanning across the back seat, he recognizes the middle passenger. It is CHARLES PALANTINE, candidate for President.  He must have left the Hotel shortly after BETSY. 
Tom, seated on the jump seat, checks his watch and speaks deferentially to Palantine: 
TOM It's 12:30 now. You'll have fifteen minutes before the actual luncheon begins. 
Palantine nods as his assistant picks up the thread of an earlier conversation. 
ASSISTANT I don't think we have to worry about anybody here committing themselves until things start coming in from California. 
Travis recognizes his passenger. He puts out his cigarette. 
TRAVIS (interrupting) Say, aren't you Charles Palantine, the candidate? 
PALANTINE (only mildly irritated) Yes I am. 
TRAVIS Well, I'm one of your biggest supporters. I tell everybody that comes in this cab that they should vote for you. 
PALANTINE (pleased; glances to check Travis' license) Why, thank you Travis. 
TRAVIS I'm sure you'll win, sir. Everybody I know is going to vote for you. (a beat) I was going to put one of your stickers on my taxi but the company said it was against their policy. 
PALANTINE (pleasant) I'll tell you, Travis, I've learned more about this country sitting in taxi cabs than in the board room of General Motors. 
TOM (joking) And in some other places too... 
Palantine, his Assistant and Tom all laugh. Palantine, quickly reassuming candiorial mien, speaks to Travis: 
PALANTINE Travis, what single thing would you want the next President of this country to do most? 
TRAVIS I don't know, sir. I don't follow political issues much. 
PALANTINE There must be something... 
TRAVIS (thinks) Well, he should clean up this city here. It's full of filth and scum. Scum and filth. It's like an open sewer. I can hardly take it. (MORE) 
TRAVIS (CONT'D) Some days I go out and smell it then I get headaches that just stay and never go away. We need a President that would clean up this whole mess.  Flush it out. 
Palantine is not a Hubert Humphrey-type professional bullshitter, and Travis' intense reply stops him dead in his tracks. He is forced to fall back on a stock answer but tries to give it some meaning. 
PALANTINE (after a pause) I know what you mean, Travis, and it's not going to be easy. We're going to have to make some radical changes. 
TRAVIS (turning the wheel) Damn straight. 
EXT. BARCLAY HOTEL 
TRAVIS' taxi pulls up in front of the Barclay Hotel. 
PALANTINE and AIDE get out of the cab. SECOND AIDE stays in back seat a moment to pay TRAVIS. 
PALANTINE looks in front window of cab momentarily and nods goodbye to TRAVIS. 
PALANTINE Nice talking to you, Travis. 
ON SCREEN, a conservatively-dressed middle-aged woman is speaking in Swedish about importance of healthy sex life in a happy marriage.  Subtitles translate her words. Then, without warning, there is a direct CUT to a couple copulating on a sterile table-like bed. 
Travis watches intently. The color, however, is slowly draining from Betsy's cheeks. One thought fills her mind: "What am I doing here?" 
TRAVIS (to himself) Damn. 
BETSY What's wrong? 
TRAVIS I forgot to get the Coca-Cola. 
That does it. Betsy just looks at him for a moment, then gets up and starts to leave. Travis, confused, hustles after her. 
He follows her out of the theatre. 
ON THE SIDEWALK 
Travis catches up with her. 
TRAVIS Where are you going? 
BETSY I'm leaving. 
TRAVIS What do you mean? 
Betsy looks at Travis, trying to understand him: 
BETSY These are not the kind of movies I go to. 
TRAVIS Well, I don't follow movies too much... 
BETSY You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to? 
The TICKET GIRL watches expressionlessly from the booth. 
TRAVIS This is sort of high class... 
BETSY I mean porno movies. 
TRAVIS (hesitant) Well... mostly... 
BETSY My God! 
TRAVIS We can go to another movie if you like, I don't care. I got money. There's plenty... 
Travis gestures toward the long row of 42nd Street marquees, but is interrupted by Betsy: 
BETSY If you just wanted to fuck, why didn't you just come right out and say it? 
Travis is flabbergasted by Betsy's blunt language. His arm still gestures toward the marquees, his lips continue to move, but words do not come out. 
Unable to respond to Betsy's question, Travis picks up where he left off: 
TRAVIS ... there's plenty of movies around here. I haven't seen any of them, but I'm sure they're good. 
BETSY No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home. 
TRAVIS (interrupting) You mean you don't want to go to a movie? (a beat) There's plenty of movies around here. 
BETSY No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all. 
TRAVIS (puzzled) Huh? 
BETSY It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis. 
TRAVIS But... Betsy... 
BETSY I'm getting a taxi. 
She walks to the curb. 
TRAVIS (following her) What about the record? 
BETSY Keep it. 
TRAVIS Can I call you? 
Travis kicks and protests as Tom leads him to the front door. 
ON THE SIDEWALK 
Travis' efforts quickly subside when Tom motions to a nearby POLICEMAN.  Travis quiets down and walks off. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. 
Travis is again making his way through the garish urban night. He stops for a PASSENGER on PARK AVE. A middle-aging professorial executive. 
C.U. TRAVIS: His face is expressionless.  The MAN makes himself comfortable in the back seat. 
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER Jackson Heights. 
Travis has no intention of driving out to Jackson Heights and coming back with a fare. 
TRAVIS I'm off duty. 
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER You mean you don't want to go out to Jackson Heights? 
TRAVIS No, I'm off duty. 
PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER Then how come your "Off Duty" light wasn't on. 
TRAVIS switches on the "Off Duty" light. 
TRAVIS It was on. (gesturing toward top of taxi) it just takes a while to warm up. Like a TV. 
TRAVIS doesn't budge. PROFESSIONAL PASSENGER curses to himself and exits cab. Travis takes off. 
POV as Travis' eyes dwell on the young HIP COUPLES coming out of a East Side movie house. 
LATER THAT NIGHT, TRAVIS pulls over for a young (mid- twenties) MAN wearing a leather sports jacket. 
TRAVIS eyes his passenger in rear-view mirror. 
YOUNG PASSENGER 471 Central Park West. 
EXT. 
TRAVIS' taxi speeds off. 
LATER, TRAVIS' taxi slows down as it approaches 400 block of Central Park West. 
Travis checks apartment numbers. 
YOUNG PASSENGER Just pull over to the curb a moment. 
TRAVIS turns the wheel. 
YOUNG PASSENGER Yeah, that's fine. Just sit here. 
TRAVIS waits impassively. The motor ticks away. 
After a long pause, the PASSENGER speaks: 
YOUNG PASSENGER Cabbie, ya see that light up there on the seventh floor, three windows from this side of the building? 
CAMERA CLOSES IN on 417 Central Park West: TRACKING UP to the seventh floor, it moves three windows to the right. 
TRAVIS (V.O.) Yeah. 
A young WOMAN wearing a slip crosses in front of the light. 
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.) Ya see that woman there? 
TRAVIS (O.S.) Yeah. 
YOUNG PASSENGER (O.S.) That's my wife. (a beat) But it ain't my apartment. (a beat) A nigger lives there. (a beat) She left me two weeks ago. It took me this long to find out where she went. (a beat) I'm gonna kill her. 
C.U. TRAVIS' face: it is devoid of expression. 
YOUNG PASSENGER What do you think of that, cabbie? 
Andy unzips a cowhide leather pouch to reveal a .44 Magnum pistol. He holds it gingerly, as if it were a precious treasure. Andy opens the chambers and cradles the long eight-inch barrel in his palm. The .44 is a huge, oversize inhuman gun. 
ANDY (admiringly) It's a monster. Can stop a car -- put a bullet right into the block. A premium high resale gun. $350 -- that's only a hundred over list. 
Easy Andy is a later version of the fast-talking, good- looking kid in college who was always making money on one scheme or another. In high school he sold lottery tickets, in college he scored dope, and now he's hustling hand guns. 
Andy holds the Magnum out for Travis' inspection. There's a worshipful CLOSEUP of the .44 Magnum. It is a monster. 
Travis hefts the huge gun. It seems out of place in his hand. It is built on Michelangelo's scale. The Magnum belongs in the hand of a marble god, not a slight taxi driver. Travis hands the gun back to Andy. 
ANDY I could sell this gun in Harlem for $500 today - but I just deal high quality goods to high quality people. (pause) Now this may be a little big for practical use, in which case I'd recommend the .38 Smith and Wesson Special. Fine solid gun - nickel plated. Snub-nosed, otherwise the same as the service revolver. Now that'll stop anything that moves and it's handy, flexible. (MORE) 
ANDY (CONT'D) The Magnum, you know, that's only if you want to splatter it against the wall. The movies have driven up the price of the Magnum anyway. Everybody wants them now. But the Wesson .38 - only $250 - and worth every dime of it. (he hefts the .38) Throw in a holster for $10. 
Travis hefts the nickel-plated .38, points it out the window. 
ANDY (CONT'D) Some of these guns are like toys, but a Smith and Wesson, man, you can hit somebody over the head with it and it will still come back dead on.  Nothing beats quality. (pause) You interested in an automatic? 
TRAVIS I want a .32.   Revolver. And a palm gun. That .22 there. 
ANDY That's the Colt .25 - a fine little gun. Don't do a lot of damage, but it's as fast as the Devil. Handy little gun, you can carry it almost anywhere. I'll throw it in for another $125. 
Travis holds the .32 Revolver, hefts it, slips it under his belt and pulls his shirt over it. He turns from side to side, to see how it rides in his waist. 
TRAVIS How much for everything. 
ANDY The .32's $150 - and you're really getting a good deal now - and all together it comes to, ah, seven eighty-five for four pieces and a holster. He'll, I'll give you the holster, we'll make it seventy-five and you've got a deal - a good one. 
TRAVIS How much to get a permit to carry? 
ANDY Well, you're talking big money now. I'd say at least five grand, maybe more, and it would take a while to check it out. The way things are going now $5.000 is probably low. You see, I try not to fool with the small-time crap. Too risky, too little bread. Say 6 G's, but if I get the permit it'll be as solid as the Empire State Building. 
TRAVIS Nah, this'll be fine. 
ANDY You can't carry in a cab even with a permit - so why bother? 
TRAVIS Is there a firing range around? 
ANDY Sure, here, take this card, go to this place and give 'em the card. They'll charge you, but there won't be any hassle. 
Travis pulls out a roll of crisp one hundred dollar bills and counts off eight. 
ANDY You in Nam? Can't help but notice your jacket? 
TRAVIS (looking up) Huh? 
ANDY Vietnam? I saw it on your jacket. Where were you? Bet you got to handle a lot of weapons out there. 
Travis hands Andy the bills. Andy counts them and gives Travis a twenty and five. 
TRAVIS Yeah. I was all around. One hospital, then the next. 
ANDY (through counting) It's he'll out there all right. A real shit-eatin' war. I'll say this, though: It's bringing a lot of fantastic guns. The market's flooded. Colt automatics are all over. (pockets the money) 
TRAVIS (intensely) They'd never get me to go back. They'd have to shoot me first. (pause) You got anything to carry these in? (gestures to pistols) 
Travis is like a light switch: For long periods he goes along dark and silent, saying nothing; then suddenly, the current is turned on and the air is filled with the electricity of his personality. Travis' inner intensity sets Andy back a bit, but he quickly recovers. 
ANDY Sure. 
Andy pulls a gym bag from under his bed. He wraps the gun in the sheet in the bag and zips it up. An identical gym bag can be partially seen under the bed. He hands Travis the bag. 
ANDY You like ball games? 
TRAVIS Huh? 
ANDY I can get you front and center. What do you like? I can get you Mets, Knicks, Rangers? Hell, I can get you the Mayor's box. 
TRAVIS Nah. I ain't interested. 
Andy closes and locks the suitcases. 
ANDY Okay, okay. 
Travis turns to leave. 
TRAVIS checks the back seat in the rear-view mirror: there sits a pale HIPPIE PROSTITUTE. 
The GIRL is, at best, 14 or 15, although she has been made up to look older.  She wears floppy, Janis Joplin clothes. Her face is pallid.  She wears large blue-tinted sunglasses and multi-colored leg stockings. 
Her name, as we shall learn later, is IRIS. 
TRAVIS hesitates, looking at her in the mirror. 
IRIS Come on, mister, let's get outta here -- quick. 
TRAVIS moves to activate the meter, when the rear door opens. 
IRIS is helped out of the cab by a MAN TRAVIS cannot see. 
SPORT (to IRIS) Come on, baby, let's go.  This is all a real drag. 
IRIS lets herself be taken out of the cab.  The rear door closes. 
Sport leans partially in the front window, throwing something on the front seat.  TRAVIS looks: it is a crumpled $20 bill. 
SPORT Just forget all about this, cabbie. It's nothing. 
TRAVIS cannot see the Sport's face lime green completely, but notices he is wearing a jacket.  The voice is that of a man in his early twenties. 
TRAVIS turns to catch a glimpse of Sport as he walks off with Iris. 
TRAVIS shrugs and turns around. 
TRAVIS' taxi pulls away. 
CUT TO: 
EARLY MORNING, 6:00 a.m.  Quitting time -- TRAVIS pulls into TAXI GARAGE. 
INT. GARAGE 
TRAVIS pulls into his stall. 
TRAVIS sits in driver's seat, thinking a moment.  He looks to his right: the crumpled $20 bill still lies there, untouched since it was thrown there six hours previously. 
TRAVIS reluctantly picks up the $20 bill and stuffs it into his jacket pocket as he gets out of the cab.  He gathers up his time report and heads toward book-in table. 
A SHORT WHILE LATER, TRAVIS is walking down the sidewalk near the taxi garage.  His hands are in his jacket pockets, obscuring the slight bulge on his left side. 
TRAVIS turns into the box offfice of PORNO THEATER.  He reaches into jacket pocket for money to purchase ticket and pulls out crumpled $20 bill.  Seeing the $20 bill, he decides not to use it, and pays for ticket out of his wallet instead. 
TRAVIS walks past concession stand en route to the darkened theater auditorium.  A YOUNG MAN is now sitting listlessly behind the concessions counter. 
INT. PORNO THEATER AUDITORIUM 
TRAVIS slouches down into his seat, his face glowing in the reflected light from the screen. 
FEMALE MOVIE VOICE (O.S.) Oh, come on, now, down, lick it, come on... (a beat) Mmm, that's good.  Ahh, ahh, more ... 
TRAVIS averts his eyes as the action on screen becomes too graphic.  Placing his stiffened right hand beside his eyes, TRAVIS can, by turning it inward, shut off or open up his field of vision by small degrees. 
MOVIE VOICE DIMINISHES, replaced by SOUND of TRAVIS' voice over. 
TRAVIS (V.O.) The idea had been growing in my brain ... 
CUT TO: 
TRACKING SHOT to wall of TRAVIS' APARTMENT.  CAMERA MOVES slowly across wall covered with clippings, notes, maps, pictures.  We now see their contents clearly: 
The wall is covered with CHARLES PALANTINE political paraphernalia; there are pictures of him, newspaper articles, leaflets, bumper stickers.  As the CAMERA MOVES along it discovers a sketch of Plaza Hotel, Kennedy Airport and cut- up sections of city maps with notations written in.  There is lengthy N.Y. Times clipping detailing the increased Secret Security Protection during the primaries.  A section pertaining to PALANTINE is underlined.  Further along there is a sheet reading "traveling schedule" and a calendar for June with finely written notations written over the dates. 
TRAVIS (V.O.)(CONTD) ... for some time.  True Force. All the king's men cannot put it back together again. 
As the CAMERA reaches the end of its track, it finds TRAVIS, standing, his shirt open, but the mattress.  He is wearing the empty holster, and the .44 is in his hand. 
In the SHOTS that follow TRAVIS gives the audience a lesson in gunmanship: 
TRAVIS practices fast-drawing the .38 Special from his holster and firing it. 
He hooks the .44 into his pants behind his back and practices withdrawing it.  He holds the .44 firmly at an arm's length, tightening his forearm muscles. 
TRAVIS Look, ah, we never talked much, you and me... 
WIZARD Yeah? 
TRAVIS I wanted to ask you something, on account you've been around so long. 
WIZARD Shoot.  They don't call me the Wizard for nothing. 
TRAVIS Well, I just, you know... 
WIZARD Things got ya down? 
TRAVIS Real down. 
WIZARD It happens. 
TRAVIS Sometimes it gets so I just don't know what I'm gonna do.  I get some real crazy ideas, you know?  Just go out and do somethin. 
WIZARD The taxi life, you mean. 
TRAVIS Yeah. 
WIZARD (nods) I know. 
TRAVIS Like do anything, you know. 
WIZARD Travis, look, I dig it.  Let me explain.  You choose a certain way of life.  You live it.  It becomes what you are.  I've been a hack 27 years, the last ten at night. Still don't own my own cab.  I guess that's the way I want it. You see, that must be what I am. 
A police car stops across the street.  TWO PATROLMEN get out and roust the JUNKIE from his doorway. 
WIZARD (continuing) Look, a person does a certain thing and that's all there is to it.  It becomes what he is.  Why fight it? What do you know?  How long you been a hack, a couple months? You're like a peg and you get dropped into a slot and you got to squirm and wiggle around a while until you fit in. 
TRAVIS (pause) That's just about the dumbest thing I ever heard, Wizard. 
WIZARD What do you expect, Bertrand Russell?  I've been a cabbie all my life, what do I know? (a beat) I don't even know what you're talking about. 
TRAVIS Neither do I, I guess. 
WIZARD You fit in.  It's lonely, it's rough at first.  But you fit in. You got no choice. 
WIZARD Yeah.  Sorry, Wizard. 
WIZARD Don't worry, Killer.  You'll be all right. (a beat) I seen enough to know. 
TRAVIS Thanks. 
WIZARD gives TRAVIS a short wave implying, "Chin up, old boy," and walks around to the driver's side of his cab. 
WIZARD drives off, leaving the street to its natural inhabitants. 
CUT TO: 
FADE IN: 
EXT. CHARLES PALANTINE RALLY - DAY 
A rally platform in a supermarket parking lot somewhere in QUEENS is draped in red, white and blue bunting. 
A CROWD of about 500 persons mills about, waiting for the rally to begin.  Piped pop-country MUSIC plays over the loudspeaker system. 
The CADRE OF SECRET SERVICE MEN, with their distinctive metallic grey suits, sun glasses and football physiques, stands out in the CROWD. 
On the PLATFORM are seated an assortment of LOCAL POLITICOS as well as some PALANTINE WORKERS and ADVISERS. 
TOM is silently reading something on the podium, and BETSY stands on the platform steps talking with ANOTHER WORKER. 
TOM looks up and to his left for a moment, then returns to what he was reading.  Then he returns his gaze to the upper left, watching something very closely. 
After a moment he walks over to the steps where BETSY is standing. 
TOM Betsy, come over here a moment. 
BETSY What is it?  I'm busy. 
TOM (insistent) Just follow me. 
LOWER EAST SIDE.  TRAVIS lets off FARE on B Street and cuts across toward Tompkins Square. 
TRAVIS turns the corner when SKREETCH! he suddenly hits the brakes, causing the cab to rock back and forth. 
He has almost hit a YOUNG GIRL recklessly crossing the street.  She thumps her hand on the taxi hood to regain her balance and stares in shock through the front window.  C.U. GIRL's face. 
TRAVIS recognizes her face: it's IRIS, the GIRL in his taxi a week or so before.  IRIS looks at TRAVIS sharply then turns and continues walking. 
TRAVIS' eyes follow her and she rejoins a GIRLFRIEND.  They are both dressed as hippie hookers: sloppy clothes, boots, jeans, floppy hats.  And the old come-hither walk is unmistakable. 
TRAVIS follows IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND slowly as they walk down the sidewalk. 
TRAVIS' P.O.V.  He examines them from bottom to top -- boots, legs, thighs, breasts, faces, hats. 
As TRAVIS rolls astride the GIRLS, he notices the familiar FRINGE OF A SUEDE JACKET standing in the shadows.  The GIRLS look toward the SHADOWED FIGURE, smile, acknowledge some unheard comment, and continue on. 
IRIS looks back uneasily at TRAVIS' taxi and continues on. 
On the corner stand TWO well-to-do COLLEGE STUDENTS, somewhat out of place in this environment, but making every attempt to groove on it.  They are high on something or another. 
The GIRLS spot the COLLEGE STUDENTS and walk over to them. They exchange some small talk and walk off together.  There is little subtlety involved: it is obviously a pick-up. 
TRAVIS must negotiate a turn around the corner if he is to continue following the GIRLS and their COLLEGIATE JOHNS. This is not so easy, since the traffic is heavy. 
As TRAVIS slows down to make the turn, he notices ANOTHER HIPPIE HOOKER who had been watching him watching IRIS and her GIRLFRIEND.  She walks over to the taxi, loans in the open left front window and gives TRAVIS the come-on disguised as an innocent question: 
C.U. HIPPIE HOOKER. 
HIPPIE HOOKER Hey cabbie!  You comin' or goin'? 
TRAVIS quickly turns his face away from her in a combination of shock, embarrassment and revulsion.  He is the child caught with his hand in the cookie jar.  The very presence of this crassly, openly sexual human being frightens and sickens him. 
TRAVIS takes off with a skreetch.  His taxi shoots down the block. 
CUT TO: 
A HOT JUNE DAY.  TRAVIS' taxi, the "Off Duty" sign on, is parked against the curb somewhere in HARLEM.  WHITE COPS, SECRET SERVICE MEN and REPORTERS, punctuate the otherwise BLACK CROWDS which walk to and fro in the b.g. 
CHARLES PALANTINE's voice can be heard coming from a distant loudspeaker system.  It is a political rally. 
TRAVIS sits behind the wheel, coldly staring at something in the distance.  His hair, of course, is still clipped short and he wears mirror-reflecting sunglasses.  Even though a drop of sweat is working its way down his cheek, TRAVIS wears his Army jacket with the bulge on the left side -- the .38 Smith and Wesson bulge. 
A BLOCK AWAY, PALANTINE stands on a platform outside his uptown campaign headquarters.  On the platform sit an array of BLACK DIGNITARIES.  Nearby we recognize the SECRET SERVICE MAN TRAVIS spoke to at the earlier rally: he scans the CROWD anxiously. 
PALANTINE is speaking animatedly.  He is an excellent speaker and captures our attention.  He drives hard toward his arguments, crashes down on his points.  His strained voice rings with sincerity and anger. 
C.U. of PALANTINE as he speaks.  He is dressed in rolled-up shirtsleeves and sweat pours down his face. 
PALANTINE The time has come to put an end to the things that divide us: racism, poverty, way -- and to those persons who seek to divide us. Never have I seen such a group of high officials from the President to Senate leaders to Cabinet members... 
CUT TO TRAVIS: no expression.  PALANTINE's words are barely distinguishable from a block away: 
PALANTINE (in distance) ... pit black against white, young against old, sow anger, disunity and suspicion -- and all in the name of the "good of the country." Well, their game is over. (applause) All their games are over.  Now is the time to stand up against such foolishness, propaganda and demagoguery.  Now is the time for one man to stand up and accept his neighbor, for one man to give in order that all might receive.  Is unity and love of common good such a lost thing? 
ALL LIVE SOUND CEASES as TRAVIS' narration begins.  He is reading from a letter or card he has just written. 
As he speaks we see SHOTS of PALANTINE speaking, a seated row of YOUNG BLACK PALANTINE red, white and blue bedecked CHEERLEADERS, SECRET SERVICE AGENTS examining the CROWD and so forth.  These SHOTS have no direct relationship to the narration. 
TRAVIS (V.O.) (reading) Dear Father and Mother, June is the month, I remember, which brings not only your wedding anniversary, but also Father's Day and Mother's birthday.  I'm sorry I can't remember the exact dates, but I hope this card will take care of all of them. I'm sorry I again can not send you my address like I promised to last year, but the sensitive nature of my work for the Army demands utmost secrecy.  I know you will understand. I am healthy and well and making lots of money.  I have been going with a girl for several months and I know you would be proud if you could see her. (MORE) 
TRAVIS (V.O.; CONT'D) Her name is Betsy, but I can tell you no more than that. (interrupted) 
As TRAVIS reads third paragraph, a POLICEMAN is seen walking from behind TRAVIS' taxi to his window. 
The POLICEMAN's voice come during a pause in the narration. LIVE SOUND RESUMES. 
POLICEMAN (standing near window) Hey, cabbie, you can't park here. 
TRAVIS (penitent) Sorry, officer. 
POLICEMAN You waiting for a fare? 
POLICEMAN leans his head in window, inspecting the cab.  As he does, TRAVIS slides his right hand into the left side of his jacket, ready to draw his revolver. 
TRAVIS No, officer. 
TRAVIS turns to walk away. 
SPORT Catch you later, Copper. 
TRAVIS freezes, not saying anything.  He turns back toward SPORT. 
TRAVIS I'm no cop. 
SPORT Well, if you are, it's entrapment already. 
TRAVIS I'm hip. 
SPORT Funny, you don't look hip. (laughs) 
TRAVIS walks back to IRIS. 
IRIS motions for TRAVIS to follow her and he does. 
IRIS and TRAVIS turn the corner and walk about a block, saying nothing.  IRIS turns into a darkened doorway and TRAVIS follows her. 
At the top of the dark stairs IRIS and TRAVIS enter a dimly lit hallway.  On either side are doors with apartment numbers.  IRIS turns toward the first door, No. 2. 
IRIS This is my room. 
At the far end of the darkened corridor sits a huge OLD MAN. His face is obscured by shadow.  TRAVIS is about to enter the room when the OLD MAN speaks up: 
OLD MAN Hey cowboy! 
TRAVIS turns his head toward the OLD MAN who has stood up and is advancing toward him. 
OLD MAN (motioning to TRAVIS' jacket) The rod. (a beat) Gimme the rod, cowboy. 
TRAVIS hesitates a moment, uncertain what to do.  The OLD MAN reaches in TRAVIS' jacket and pulls out the .38 Special. 
OLD MAN This ain't Dodge City, cowboy.  You don't need no piece. (glances at watch) I'm keepin' time. 
TRAVIS enters No. 2 with IRIS. 
TRAVIS looks around IRIS' room: although dimly lit, the room is brightly decorated.  There is an orange shag carpet, deep brown walls and an old red velvet sofa.  On the walls are posters of Mick Jagger, Bob Dylan and Peter Fonda.  A Neil Young album is playing on a small phonograph. 
This is where IRIS lives: it bears the individual touch of a young girl. 
IRIS lights a cigarette, takes a single puff and places it in an ashtray on the bedstand. 
TRAVIS Why you hang around with them greasers? 
IRIS A girl needs protection. 
TRAVIS Yeah.  From the likes of them. 
IRIS (shrugs) It's your time mister.  Fifteen minutes ain't long. (gestures to cigarette) That cigarette burns out, your time is up. 
IRIS sits on the edge of the bed and removes her hat and coat.  She takes off her blue-tinted sunglasses--her last defense.  Without the paraphernalia of adulthood, Iris looks like a little girl she is.  About 14, 15. 
TRAVIS What's your name? 
IRIS Easy. 
TRAVIS That ain't much of a name. 
IRIS It's easy to remember.  Easy Lay. 
TRAVIS What's your real name? 
IRIS I don't like my real name. 
TRAVIS (insistent) What's your real name? 
IRIS Iris. 
TRAVIS That's a nice name. 
IRIS That's what you think. 
IRIS unbuttons her shirt, revealing her small pathetic breasts -- two young doves hiding from a winter wind. TRAVIS is unnerved by her partial nudity. 
TRAVIS But that one night? 
IRIS I was stoned.  That's why they stopped me.  When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go.  They just protect me from myself. 
There is a pause.  TRAVIS smiles and shrugs apologetically. TRAVIS looks at Iris' cigarette.  It's burning down to the butt. 
TRAVIS Well, I tried. 
IRIS (compassionate) I understand, mister.  It means something, really. 
TRAVIS (getting up) Can I see you again? 
IRIS That's not hard to do. 
TRAVIS No, I mean really.  This is nothing for a person to do. 
IRIS Sure.  All right.  We'll have breakfast.  I get up about one o'clock.  Tomorrow. 
TRAVIS (thinking) Well tomorrow noon there's a... I got a... 
IRIS is interfering with TRAVIS' assassination schedule. 
IRIS Well, you want to or not? 
TRAVIS (deciding) O.K. It's a date.  I'll see you here, then. 
TRAVIS turns; IRIS smiles. 
TOM Oh, Iris? 
IRIS Yes? 
TOM My name's Travis. 
IRIS Thank you, Travis. 
TRAVIS So long, Iris. (a beat) Sweet Iris. (smiles) 
TRAVIS exits. 
TRAVIS closes the door to No. 2 and stands in the corridor for a moment. 
The OLD MAN slowly walks from the dark end of the hallway with TRAVIS' .38 in his hand.  OLD MAN stands near TRAVIS, and checks his watch. 
OLD MAN (holding gun) I think this is yours, cowboy. 
TRAVIS reaches in his jacket pocket and pulls out the familiar crumpled $20 bill.  He makes a big show of stuffing the wrinkled bill into the OLD MAN's hand.  The OLD MAN doesn't understand the significance of it. 
TRAVIS (restrained anger) Here's the twenty bucks, old man. You better damn well spend it right. 
TRAVIS turns and walks away. 
OLD MAN says as TRAVIS walks down stairs: 
OLD MAN Come back anytime you want, cowboy. But without the rod -- please. 
TRAVIS does not respond. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ST. REGIS SUITE NOON 
Palantine, Tom and Palantine's Assistant are seated in garishly decorated suite. 
ASSISTANT Well, at least it wasn't chicken. 
PALANTINE It wasn't?  I thought it was.  It tasted like chicken. 
TOM C'mon, Senator.  That was a class dinner.  The St. Regis is a class joint.  That was veal. 
PALANTINE Was it?  It sure tasted like chicken to me. (a beat) Lately, everything tastes like chicken to me. 
ASSISTANT Everything?  Got to watch your gut. 
PALANTINE What about it?  I took 20 off before we started this thing. 
IRIS He never killed nobody.  He's a Libra. 
TRAVIS Huh? 
IRIS I'm a Libra too.  That's why we get along so well. 
TRAVIS He looks like a killer. 
IRIS I think Cancer's make the best lovers.  My whole family are air signs. 
TRAVIS He shoots dope too. 
IRIS What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror.  You don't get eyes like that from... 
TRAVIS He's worse than an animal.  Jail's too good for scum like that. 
There is a brief silence.  Iris mind continued to whirl at 78 rpms.  She seems to have three subjects on her mind at a time.  She welcomes this opportunity to unburden herself. 
IRIS Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think.  Before that it was fantastic.  I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore.  Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know?  It was unbelievable.  Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane--that's my group, man. All Libras.  But now everybody's split or got sick or busted.  I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went.  I stayed here. 
TRAVIS I never been to a commune.  I don't know.  I saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me. 
IRIS Why don't you come to a commune with me? 
TRAVIS Me?  I could never go to a place like that. 
IRIS Why not? 
TRAVIS (hesitant) I... I don't get along with people like that. 
IRIS You a scorpion?  That's it.  You're a scorpion.  I can tell. 
TRAVIS Besides, I've got to stay here. 
IRIS Why? 
TRAVIS I've got something important to do. I can't leave. 
IRIS What's so important? 
TRAVIS I can't say -- it's top secret. I'm doing something for the Army. The cab thing is just part time. 
IRIS You a narc? 
TRAVIS Do I look like a narc? 
IRIS Yeah. 
TRAVIS breaks out in his big infectious grin, and IRIS joins his laughter. 
IRIS God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me. 
TRAVIS (pause) What are you going to do about Sport and that old bastard? 
IRIS Just leave'em.  There's plenty of other girls. 
TRAVIS You just gonna leave 'em? 
IRIS (astonished) What should I do?  Call the cops? 
TRAVIS Cops don't do nothin. 
IRIS Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once. 
TRAVIS You can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls.  You should get rid of them. 
IRIS How? 
TRAVIS (shrugs) I don't know.  Just should, though. (a beat) Somebody should kill 'em.  Nobody'd miss 'em. 
IRIS (taken back) God.  I know where they should have a commune for you.  They should have a commune for you at Bellevue. 
TRAVIS (apologetic/sheepish) I'm sorry, Iris.  I didn't mean that. 
IRIS You're not much with girls, are you? 
INTERCUT: PRIVATE COP turns up darkened stairway to IRIS' apartment. 
NIGHT has fallen: TRAVIS' taxi careens down 10th Ave.  He speeds, honks, accelerates quickly.  The glare of speeding yellow and red lights flash through the night. 
TRAVIS' P.O.V.: PEDESTRIAN attempts to flag down TRAVIS' taxi, but quickly steps back up on the curb when he sees TRAVIS has no intention of stopping for anything. 
INTERCUT: SPORT maintains his post in the dark doorway.  He waves to a GIRL who passes, and she waves back. 
TRAVIS' taxi screeches to a stop and parks obliquely against the curb. 
CUT TO: 
TRAVIS walks down the block to the doorway where SPORT stands.  CAMERA TRACKS with TRAVIS. 
Without slowing, TRAVIS walks up to SPORT and puts his arm on his shoulder in a gesture of friendliness. 
TRAVIS Hey, Sport.  How are things? 
SPORT (shrugs) O.K., cowboy. 
TRAVIS (needling him) How are things in the pimp business, hey Sport? 
SPORT What's going on? 
TRAVIS I'm here to see Iris. 
SPORT Iris? 
TRAVIS pushes SPORT back into the dark recesses of the corridor. 
SPORT Wha -- ? 
TRAVIS Yeah, Iris.  You know anybody by that name? 
SPORT No. (beat) Hillbilly, you'd better get your wise ass outa here and quick, or you're gonna be in trouble. 
TRAVIS is being propelled by an inner force, a force which takes him past the boundaries of reason and self-control. 
TRAVIS (restrained anger) You carry a gun? 
SPORT looks into TRAVIS' eyes, saying nothing: he realizes the seriousness of the situation. 
TRAVIS pulls his .38 Special and holds it on SPORT, pushing him even further back against the wall. 
TRAVIS Get it. 
SPORT (submissive) Hey, mister, I don't know what's going on here.  This don't make any sense. 
TRAVIS (demanding) Show it to me. 
SPORT reluctantly pulls a .32 caliber pistol (a "purse gun") from his pocket and holds it limply. 
TRAVIS sticks his .38 into SPORT's gut and discharges it. There is a muffled blast, followed by a muted scream of pain. 
TRAVIS Now suck on that. 
Agony and shock cross SPORT'S face as he slumps to the floor. TRAVIS turns and walks away before SPORT even hits. 
As TRAVIS walks away, SPORT can be seen struggling in the b.g. 
TRAVIS, he gun slipped into his jacket, walks quickly up the sidewalk. 
AROUND THE CORNER, TRAVIS walks into the darkened stairway leading to IRIS' apartment. 
As he walks up the stairs, TRAVIS pulls the .44 Magnum from behind his back and transfers the .38 Special to his left hand.  He walks up the steps, a pistol dangling from each hand. 
AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS, TRAVIS spots THE OLD MAN sitting at the far end of the dark corridor.  THE OLD MAN starts to get up when TRAVIS discharges the mighty .44 at him.  BLAAM! The hallway reverberates with shock waves and gun powder. 
THE OLD MAN staggers at the end of the corridor: his right hand has been blown off at the forearm. 
There is the sharp SOUND of a GUNSHOT behind TRAVIS: his face grimaces in pain.  A bullet has ripped through the left side of his neck.  Blood flows over his left shoulder. 
TRAVIS' .44 flies into the air. 
TRAVIS looks down the stairway: there SPORT lies choking in a puddle of his own blood.  He has struggled long enough to fire one shot. 
-- down the blood-specked stairs on which lies a nickle- plated .38 Smith and Wesson Special 
-- to the foot of the stairs where SPORT's body is hunched over a pool of blood and a small .32 lies near his hand 
-- to CROWDS huddled around the doorway, held back by POLICE OFFICERS 
-- past red flashing lights, running POLICEMEN and parked police cars 
-- to the ongoing nightlife of the Lower East Side, curious but basically unconcerned, looking then heading its own way.

EXT. TRAVIS' APARTMENT - DAY 
It is EARLY FALL.  The trees are losing their leaves. 
CUT TO: 
SLOW TRACKING SHOT across INT. APARTMENT.  Room appears pretty much the same, although there is a new portable TV and an inexpensive easy chair. 
VISUAL: TRACK begins at table and works across the room to the mattress. 
We see these items: 
-- On the table rests the diary, closed.  A desk calendar stands on the table: it is October. 
-- Across the wall where the Palantine clippings once hung there are now a series of new newspaper clippings.  Right to left, they read: 
1. The first is a full back page from the N.Y. Daily News. Headline reads: "CABBIE BATTLES GANGSTERS." There are large photos of police standing in IRIS' room after the slaughter, and a picture of TRAVIS' cabbie mug shot. 
2. Underneath there is a more discreet clipping without photo from the N.Y. Times.  Two-column headline reads: "Cabbie Shootout, Three Dead." 
3. A follow-up story from the News.  Two-column photo shows plain middle-aged couple sitting in middle-class living room. Two-column headline reads: "Parents Express Shock, Gratitude." 
4. A two-column Daily News story without photo.  Headline reads: "Taxi-Driver Hero to Recover." 
5. A one-column two-paragraph News story stuck on an obscure page.  Headline reads: "Cabbie Returns to Job." 
-- At the end of the clippings, a letter is tacked to the wall.  It is a simple letter hand-written on plain white paper.  The handwriting makes a conscious effort to appear neat and orderly.  We recognize that it is the same letter that is being read in voice over. 
-- When we finally arrive at the mattress, we find it is barren.  A pillow and blanket (new purchases) are folded at the head of the mattress. 
AUDIO: THROUGHOUT THE TRACK, we hear the voice of a middle- aged uneducated man reading in voice over. 
It is the voice of IRIS' FATHER and he is reading a letter he sent to TRAVIS, and which TRAVIS has tacked to his wall. 
IRIS' FATHER (V.O.) Dear Mr. Bickle, 
I can't say how happy Mrs. Steensma and I were to hear that you are well and recuperating.  We tried to visit you at the hospital when we were in New York to pick up Iris, but you were still in a coma. 
There is no way we can repay you for returning our Iris to us.  We thought we had lost her, but now our lives are full again.  Needless to say, you are something of a hero around this household. 
I'm sure you want to know about Iris.  She is back in school and working hard.  The transition has been very hard for her, as you can well imagine, but we have taken steps to see she never has cause to run away again. 
In conclusion, Mrs. Steensma and I would like to again thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Unfortunately, we cannot afford to come to New York again to thank you in person, or we surely would.  But if you should ever come to Pittsburgh, you would find yourself a most welcome guest in our home. 
Our deepest thanks, 
Burt and Ivy Steensma 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PLAZA HOTEL - NIGHT 
Four cabs stand in the waiting line in front of the hotel. 
Near the entrance, TRAVIS and WIZARD stand in the light talking. 
TRAVIS' hair is almost fully grown back to its normal length. TRAVIS wears the same clothes -- cowboy boots, jeans, western shirt, Army jacket -- but he isn't wearing a gun. There is a thick scar on the left side of his neck. 
Wizard is speaking. 
WIZARD A private-owner wanted to swap wheels.  Now my tires were brand new. "Give me a couple days," I says.

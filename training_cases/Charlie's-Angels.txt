CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99 
FADE IN: 
EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - DAY 
A VIRGIN AIR 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off. 
INT. VIRGIN AIR 747 - DAY 
We move through the FIRST CLASS CABIN. It's the regular mix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying freshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T- shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and... 
...a very nervous MAN. 
Shifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row. We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then we continue moving into -- 
THE COACH SECTION 
Stopping at the lavatory, the "OCCUPIED" sign switches to "VACANT" and... 
JAMES EARL JONES 
(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of description, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones) steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia: multi-colored dashiki, mufti (it's a kind of hat), the works. He heads up the aisle towards -- 
THE FIRST CLASS CABIN 
Where he is stopped by a -- 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is restricted to first cl... 
Mr. Jones now removes a FIRST CLASS TICKET. 
JAMES EARL JONES Is this what you're looking for? 
She looks at it -- a little confused as to why he's just handing it to her now -- but then she nods. As he passes: 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there anything I can get you? 
JAMES EARL JONES Scotch, blended. Straight. 
He continues into the first class cabin and toward -- 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              2. 
THE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOM 
Where he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his name is PASQUAL) and sits by the window. 
After a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and leans, slightly, towards Jones. 
PASQUAL (tentatively) They say birds can't fly this high. 
JAMES EARL JONES They say only angels can. 
Now Pasqual nods. Nervously begins to remove something from his pocket when they are interrupted by -- 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Shall I pour your scotch? 
JAMES EARL JONES No -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you. 
She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off the glass. She shrugs, leaving... 
Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- "Well? What about your end of the bargain?" 
From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles. 
He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny, high-tech triggering mechanism. 
JAMES EARL JONES Ah, c-5. The most dangerous explosive material ever invented. Hard to believe that this little contraption could blow up ten city blocks. 
PASQUAL Be careful with it, huh? 
Both men smile.   Pasqual's very relieved that the deal is done. 
Then suddenly, the lights blink out. 
Pasqual looks around, nervous. But it's just the in- flight movie beginning. Clouds, and a woman holding a torch. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              3. 
CONTINUED: 
Columbia Pictures presents... David Spade and Adam Sandler in "BOSOM BUDDIES: THE MOVIE." 
James Earl Jones shakes his head, rolls his eyes. 
JASON Marix has a thing for red. Red cars, red boats, red-headed hookers. 
ALEX So the red one. 
JASON That's why I'm gonna say blue. 
He makes a "snip" motion.     They both breathe a sigh of relief. 
ALEX You saved the world again, Logan. 
She leans forward, closer and closer, right in his face. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                      11. 
CONTINUED: 
JASON That's my job. 
Alex kisses him. It's a damn good kiss.          Jason's into it, but pulls away for a second. 
JASON (CONT'D) I don't think Sanchez would kiss me. He's a forty-year-old man. 
Pull back to reveal... 
ALEX and JASON are in a fully macked out Airstream, sitting on a bed, leaning over an open screenplay. We can tell from our surroundings that Jason is a big deal Hollywood action star, and this trailer is his home away from home. 
She licks the bridge of his nose, then kisses him again. 
ALEX Let's have it rewritten. 
As she smiLes, a cell phone RINGS. Both Alex and Jason reach for their phones. It's hers. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Hello? 
EXT. JASON'S AIRSTREAM - DAY 
Jason stands in the doorway in his robe as Alex tosses her stuff in the back of a very excellent car. 
JASON So when you coming back? 
ALEX Not sure.   Whenever I can.      I'll call you. 
JASON Oh, great, that's helpful. (watching her prepare to go) I don't get it, what kind of executive assistant is on 24 hour call? 
ALEX A very good one. 
JASON You ask me, your boss is an asshole. (beat) When do I get to meet this Charlie guy, anyway? (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  12. 
CONTINUED: 
ALEX Charlie's not very social. 
JASON Yeah, well I think you should quit. 
ALEX Charlie needs me. 
JASON I need you. 
Alex looks back -- that was more personally revealing than she expected. 
A P.A. comes up next to Jason. 
P.A. Mr. Gibbons?   We're ready for you on the set. 
Jason nods, then back to Alex. 
JASON I gotta go save the world. 
Alex smiles at the irony of that. 
ALEX My hero. 
She blows him a kiss and speeds off. 
EXT. BEACH APARTMENT WALKWAY - DAY 
Natalie KNOCKS on the door to 113.      A beat later, the door swings open to reveal BOB. 
Natalie SCREAMS in astonishment. 
BOB (freaked) What!   Natalie, what? 
NATALIE I thought you were dead. 
She pushes past him. 
INT. BOB'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Natalie makes a beeline for his keys on the table. Starts taking one key off the ring. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                     13. 
CONTINUED: NATALIE I thought the police might be here. Or your neighbors. Or your parents, here to identify your remains. 
DYLAN It's good to be him. 
ALEX So what's the catch? 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Last night, Knox was kidnapped from his own office. 
ON VIDEO: Surveillance camera footage of a parking garage. Two MEN IN HOODS shove Knox into black car. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               16. 
CONTINUED: NATALIE Any ransom? 
CHARLIE'S VOICE No one's heard a thing from the kidnappers. 
A WOMAN'S VOICE They don't want money. They just want to sink our company. 
A striking WOMAN IN A SUIT stands in the doorway. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Angels, meet Vivian Wu, vice president of finance for Knox Technologies. She's hired us to find Knox. 
VIVIAN WU (entering) The initial public offering is in three days. If we don't get Mr. Knox back, or if word gets out that he's missing, the company stands to lose a billion dollars. 
She seems to direct this next sentence right to Natalie. 
VIVIAN WU (CONT'D) We need your help. 
ALEX Charlie, where do we start? 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Alex, I want you and Bosley to stake out Roger Corwin. 
Bosley is excited to hear his name mentioned. 
ON VIDEO: Roger Corwin. He's an unpleasant-looking man, who's even nastier when he tries to smile. We see logos for his company, Red Star Systems 
CHARLIE'S VOICE (CONT'D) For the past year, he's been trying to buy Knox's company and their new browser software. Knox refused to sell. His company, Red Start Systems, has the most to gain from Knox's disappearance. 
ALEX Kidnap the founder and you sink the company. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   17. 
CONTINUED: 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Exactly, Alex. Let's keep our eyes on Mr. Corwin, Angels. If Knox is still alive, Corwin might lead us to him. 
DYLAN We're on it. 
NATALIE Any chance you can join us, Charlie? 
CUT TO: 
CHARLIE'S POV 
We see his chalky fingers grabbing into a hand hold. We're halfway up the face of Yosemite's El Capitan -- the ground is hundreds of feet below. 
CHARLIE (O.S.) I'd love to, angels, but I've got my hands full this morning. 
Two beautiful and buxomly CLIMBING BUDDIES smile at him. 
WIPE TO: 
EXT. PALM SPRINGS SPA - DAY 
Establishing... 
EXT. SPA DECK / OUTSIDE WALKWAY - DAY 
Built into the Palm Springs Hills, this very exclusive spa has a fantastic view of the desert. 
Dressed in a crisp spa uniform, Alex has a sidebar with a white-robed Bosley. She shows him a tiny electronic device shaped like a bullet. 
ALEX This is a transmitter. I'll be able to hear everything you say. 
BOSLEY Where do I hide it? (leaning close) I'll be nude. 
Alex takes a plastic cup, drops the transmitter into it. Covers it over with ice chips from a nearby bucket. 
Bosley nods, clever. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  18. 
CONTINUED: ALEX Try to get Corwin to talk about the industry, Knox, anything. 
BOSLEY Understood. 
She points him in the direction of the men's spa.    But he's frozen with excitement. 
BOSLEY (CONT'D) I'm going undercover. 
ALEX I know.   You'll do great. 
INT. MEN'S STEAM ROOM - DAY 
A burst of steam clears, revealing Bosley. He waddles forward in his shower clogs, which SQUISH with every step. He's wearing two towels: one around his waist, and a second around his chest. 
As more steam dissipates, we see there    are SEVEN MEN sitting on the risers. Six are gorgeous, ranging     from Calvin Klein models to Marlboro Men. Bosley looks around,     taking a keen interest. Maybe he's checking them out, maybe he    isn't. We just don't know. 
The seventh man is ROGER CORWIN, who we recognize from the videotape. He's leaning forward, a gold chain dangling. It's beside him that Bosley takes a seat. 
A beat. Yeah, he must have.     A patented ANGELS FLIP leads us to... 
CUT TO: 
INT. NATALIE'S EXCELLENT CONVERTIBLE - DAY 
The Angels are all in the car together, cruising down Sunset Boulevard. Dylan drives, Alex in the passenger seat, Natalie in the back seat with her computer on her lap. 
NATALIE Can you not drive my car so fast, Dyl? I'm trying to type. 
DYLAN (to Alex, under her breath) I drive too fast. Look who's talking. 
She pulls into an In N' Out Burger, right up to the drive thru. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) Three double doubles, animal style. Fries. Three chocolate shakes. 
While they wait for their order, Natalie punches something up on her computer. 
NATALIE Here's Corwin's itinerary. 
ONSCREEN -- we see a list of all Corwin's plans for the next week. Two events in particular stand out: 
TUESDAY NIGHT -- INVESTOR RECEPTION, BILTMORE HOTEL 
THURSDAY -- SAN DIEGO RACEWAY 
Dylan glances over the schedule. 
DYLAN Alright, we'll hit the reception tonight. I only wish we had a clue to go on. 
The food comes, Dylan takes it. 
NATALIE Hold that thought. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                    22. 
CONTINUED: 
Natalie goes back to the computer again, slipping a CD into the drive. Dylan hands out the food, spilling a lot of it. A big glop of chocolate shake lands on the keyboard. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) Uh, hello?   Expensive equipment. 
DYLAN Sorry. 
Natalie licks the shake off her fingers, tapes away at the keyboard. 
NATALIE Check this out. New program I just got from a friend in the Bureau. We take that footage from the kidnapping... 
On screen, the footage downloads from the CD, into the program. Natalie fast forwards through it until she comes to a shot of one of the kidnappers where his mask is partly pulled away from his face. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) ... isolate the part of the suspect's face that's revealed, then retriangulate his bone structure... 
The program zooms in on the revealed part of his face, then runs a series of calculations. A new drawing starts to appear. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) ... and voila!     We've got a composite. 
Natalie's portable printer spits out a simulated composite of one skinny, bad-looking dude. Dylan grabs it, looks it over. 
DYLAN Sweet. Now we've got someone to look for. 
She hands it to Alex to inspect. 
ALEX Oh yeah. He'll be easy to spot with that open head wound. 
She turns the composite around, revealing that Dylan has smudged his head with ketchup. 
They all just have to laugh. 
WIPE TO: 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  23. 
INT. BILTMORE BALLROOM - DAY 
A sophisticated reception is in full swing, an ocean of smart suits and power ties. 
Dressed as a catering waitress, Natalie carries a tray of hors d'oeuvres. MOVING WITH her, we pass ROGER CORWIN, who talks with another suit, and further on, a conservatively- dressed DYLAN who chats up a group of WALL STREET TYPES. 
DYLAN The average investor sees technology stocks as discrete entities, "This one is up 50 points, this one is down 10." It's only through derivative analysis that one sees the real power of that sector. 
A few nods.    She makes a good point. 
BROKER GUY Which analysis method do you prefer? 
On Dylan.    Shit.     She tries to stall... 
DYLAN Well, there are so many options. I mean, who can say what the one best choice is? 
ACROSS THE ROOM 
Still walking, Natalie talks to no one... 
NATALIE Keppler-Wilson. 
BACK WITH DYLAN 
DYLAN Pardon me. 
He doesn't respond, but something about this man raises her suspicions. Where has she seen him before? As he moves out of earshot... 
DYLAN (CONT'D) Natalie.   Nine o'clock. Thin man. 
ON NATALIE 
NATALIE I'm on it. 
Spotting the Thin Man, she heads his way. 
NATALIE (offering) Vegetarian spring roll? 
He waves her away, no. Oops, she drops a napkin in front of him. She kneels down to get it. 
As we move in VERY CLOSE ON her tray, we see that there's a tiny Digital display. A metal detector is built into the rim. 
It BLIPS as she moves past his ankle. And again as she rises up past his chest. The man just keeps walking. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) (to earpiece) Two guns. One ankle, one shoulder. 
DYLAN You call it. 
NATALIE You take point. I'll circle behind. 
DYLAN Copy. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
The Thin Man is headed down the hall.    Looking back, we see Dylan enter from the ballroom. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 27. 
CONTINUED: DYLAN Excuse me? 
He doesn't turn back. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) Excuse me, do you know which way the ladies' room is? 
The man takes a sudden right into a service hallway. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) Why do they always run? 
She slips off her heels to give chase. 
INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY 
The Thin Man comes around the corner.       We stay TIGHT on him, until he suddenly stops. 
NATALIE 
has come around from the other side. His bad guy instincts tell him these women are working together. He's boxed in. 
And then, a DING! 
Elevator doors open beside him. He looks in to see the clue- less BELLBOY, who had a funky groove going on his headphones. In a single motion, the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the hallway and takes his place. Hits the button. 
From opposite directions, Natalie and Dylan run to the elevator, but the doors have already shut. Checking the panel. 
DYLAN He's going down. 
They take the stairs. 
INT. BASEMENT SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY 
Natalie and Dylan emerge from the staircase to find the elevator empty. To the left, exit doors swing tellingly. 
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY 
Nat and Dylan smash through the exit doors and out into the sun-drenched streets of beautiful, downtown Los Angeles. Natalie immediately spots the Thin Man, booking down the alley. 
NATALIE That way. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 28. 
CONTINUED: 
And they take off after him. 
What ensues is the fastest, wildest, two chicks and one guy foot chase you've ever seen. Here are some highlights: 
-- Thin Man pulls himself, clumsily, over a chain link fence. Dylan and Natalie pull an old Jackie Chan trick and run up the side wall and hop over easily. 
-- Thin Man, still on foot, waits for traffic to slow, then darts across the Harbor Freeway. By the time Dylan and Natalie get there, traffic is roaring again. Undeterred, they make their way through, tucking and rolling under the wheels of a moving semi. 
-- Dylan is racing down an alley, when a car comes barrelling at her. She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives underneath her, a la one of those That's Incredible! stunts. 
-- They chase the Thin Man into an industrial laundromat. The scene goes something like this: 
INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY ROOM 
Thunderously LOUD, with industrial washers and dryers operating at full tilt. Natalie and Dylan are just entering when 
THREE SHOTS 
ring out.    They dive for cover behind a massive washer assembly. 
ALEX That looks like our target. 
She points to a door at the back of the bar that leads into a glassed-in office. Two, beefy bouncer types are guarding the door. 
ALEX (CONT'D) I'm gonna need a distraction. 
Dylan and Natalie smile at each other. 
DYLAN I think that can be arranged. 
The Three Angels split up, Bosley tagging along with Dylan. 
DYLAN 
sidles up to the bar. A group of three rednecks are downing shots, one after another. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) Three shots of tequila, please. (Bosley whispers in her ear) And one Tom Collins. 
The rednecks stare at Dylan, drooling.       Dylan turns to the first one. 
REDNECK Hey baby, why don't you ditch that stiff and come sit on ma lap? 
Bosley tries to make himself small. 
DYLAN Ooh, that is an enticing offer. But I got a better idea. How about a shot contest? My treat? 
The three rednecks hoot and holler. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) Okay, I'll take that as a yes. Bartender? Bring ten shots of tequila over to my table. And keep em coming. 
BY THE MECHANICAL BULL (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  32. 
CONTINUED: 
A group of wanna bes are waiting their turn at the mechanical bull. Natalie wanders over behind them. 
NATALIE Mind if I try? 
The crowd parts for her, and Natalie hops up on the bull. She cranks it up, and lets 
BY THE BAR -- 
Dylan downs a shot, slams it on the table.      Countless other glasses surround her. 
REVEAL that two of the rednecks are down for the count, one falling out of his chair, the other passed out on the table. 
The third redneck is slurring badly, trying to keep up with Dylan. DYLAN Hey, I've got an idea. Now let's have a chair throwing contest. 
REDNECK Hunh? 
DYLAN Chair throwing? Never heard of it? You just pick up your chair and throw it as far as you can. 
The redneck nods, lifts up his chair and heaves it across the bar. 
OKAY, HERE'S AN OUTLINE OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE REST OF THIS SCENE: 
Dylan and Natalie create a distraction, while Alex sneaks into the back office with Bosley to get the phone number of the chalet. 
EXT. HIGH MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT 
A VW van climbs the winding road.       As we get closer, we see the side reads, "Chalet Grams." 
A DING-DONG DING-DING-DONG doorbell rings. 
INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE / GREAT ROOM - NIGHT 
TWO THUGS with shoulder holsters look up, hearing the bell. One was tending to the fire. 
THUG ONE We expecting somebody? (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              33. 
CONTINUED: 
Thug Two shakes his head. 
Checking his gun, Thug One grabs for his windbreaker. Puts it on over. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 
Thug One opens the door to find Dylan and Natalie dressed in Swiss Miss outfits, complete with blonde braids. 
DYLAN Guten Tag! 
NATALIE (correcting Dylan) Guten Morgen! 
DYLAN (correcting Natalie) Guten Nacht! 
DYLAN AND NATALIE (to each other) Guten Freund! 
The girls lean in and hug each other, butts sticking out. To the left, Bosley starts playing oommpa OOMMPA oommpa OOMMPA on a wrap-around tuba. He's wearing lederhosen, with a feather in his hat. 
Natalie begins to YODEL. 
Dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug. Thug Two is approaching from behind, curious what the hell is going on. 
The thugs are out of their seats a moment later, each of them pulling out a firearm. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT 
Holding down three keys on the tuba, Bosley talks into the mouthpiece. It has a secret radio. 
BOSLEY Alex, what's your status? 
INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT 
Running, Alex pushes Knox ahead of her, checking their backs. She talks into a wrist-mic. 
ALEX Good news:   I found Knox. 
Another THUG steps out in front of her.      She kicks him down the steps. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Bad news:    I found company. 
Reaching the bottom of the steps, Knox is surprised to be grabbed by Dylan. 
DYLAN This way. 
At this point, he'll do whatever they say. 
EXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT 
Dylan rushes Knox across the driveway to the waiting van -- Natalie is pulling it around. Overhead, bright security lights switch on. 
Back at the front door, Alex pulls it shut. She attaches a carabiner clip to the handle, running a thin steel cord from it around the porch column. 
INT. FOYER - NIGHT 
The first of the thugs reaches the door, tries to pull it open but can't. The next few guards try to help him, while the rest start smashing through the windows. 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               37. 
EXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT 
Running with the tuba, Bosley stops for a moment to catch his breath, hands on his knees. Okay, ready to run again. 
He's the last to be pulled into the van.    A spray of gravel and they're off. 
INT. THE VAN - NIGHT 
Everyone is piled on top of each other. Dylan and Knox have a few awkward moments as they get untangled. Bosley keeps making inappropriate TUBA NOISES. 
At the wheel, Natalie is fierce and focused, in total control. 
Looking out the back windows, Alex sees the kidnappers piling into jeeps to give chase. From the side of the house, more thugs appear on motorbikes. 
ALEX They're coming after us. 
DYLAN (to Knox, confident) We were expecting that. 
NATALIE Okay, new problem. 
Everyone's attention WHIPS FORWARD to see the headlights of 
GIANT LOGGING TRUCK 
coming up the high mountain road. It straddles the center line, blocking both directions. There's no way around it. NATALIE (CONT'D) Thoughts, suggestions, points to consider? 
BOSLEY I don't suppose giving up would be a... 
No, it wouldn't.   Then -- 
DYLAN Right! 
NATALIE There is no right. 
DYLAN There! (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   38. 
CONTINUED: 
She points to a faded "CLOSED" sign that hangs from a chain. In the darkness, who knows what it's blocking. But as we hear the THUNDEROUS HORN from the oncoming truck, we know there's no choice. 
Natalie cuts a hard right, SMASHING through the sign. 
The van THUMPS AND BUMPS its way across the low grass, its headlights only showing ten feet ahead. At any moment, the ground could stop in a cliff. 
Like now. 
The van leaps into empty space.      Tires spin, helpless. The van falls. 
Everyone SCREAMS.    Bosley is the loudest. 
And then, touchdown. The van hits the ground, hard but not catastrophically. Natalie hits the brakes, cuts the wheel hard to avoid hitting 
A CONCRETE WALL 
in front of them.    Everyone takes a beat to acknowledge they're alive. 
DYLAN Where are we? 
Suddenly, a BRIGHT LIGHT goes on overhead. 
DYLAN Call him, he'll totally understand. 
NATALIE "Gee, sorry Pete. I had to rescue a billionaire." (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  41. 
CONTINUED: 
ALEX Hard left! 
She makes the left. 
NATALIE I'll sound like a flake.   I can't stand flakes. 
DYLAN He will so give you the second chance. 
NATALIE You think? 
DYLAN Hello, I saw the way he looked at you. 
One motorcycle charges, coming up just feet from the windshield. Natalie taps on the brakes. The freaked out guy can't slow down in time. He SMACKS into the windshield, then goes flying. 
ALEX We're at the bottom! 
Indeed, we are. The concrete walls end, leaving open ground. Slamming on the brakes, Natalie turns the van around. Everyone goes flying. Bosley is still on the phone with Charlie. 
EXT. BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT 
Back facing the right direction, the van charges onward. The motorcycles race up to the passenger side, grabbing for the door. 
INT. THE VAN - NIGHT 
Dylan SLAMS open the door, knocking one RIDER off. 
The sliding door opens, another RIDER outside trying to get in. Thinking fast, Knox grabs Bosley's tuba and shoves it at the motorcyclist, who tumbles, taking out the fourth rider in the process. 
DYLAN (genuinely impressed) Well done. 
KNOX Thanks. 
CUT TO: 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                42. 
HELICOPTER 
thunders over.    We are... 
INT. THE HELICOPTER - NIGHT 
Natalie is at the controls, Bosley beside her.      Alex leans forward from the second row. 
BOSLEY I think that went very well. Charlie should send me on more missions. 
ALEX We couldn't have done it without you, Bos. 
Natalie pats him on the arm. She and Alex exchange a quick glance. They have to just laugh. 
In the back row, Knox is looking out over the gorgeous lights of Aspen. 
DYLAN Cocktail? 
She offers him an airplane-sized bottle of Johnnie Walker black. He takes it and toasts. They both down their drinks in a single shot. A smile, and then... 
MUSIC rises. 
THE ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends. 
The act is over.    After a beat, we 
WIPE TO REVEAL: 
EXT. CHARLES TOWNSEND DETECTIVE AGENCY - DAY 
Re-establishing. 
INT. CHARLES TOWNSEND DETECTIVE AGENCY - (THE NEXT) DAY 
Charlie is on the speakerphone.      The angels are in their usual lounging positions. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Good work, Angels. Not only did you save Knox, you saved his company as well. 
DYLAN I think that earns us a vacation. 
NATALIE Say, Fiji?

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 43.

ALEX (to Natalie) Any special guy you were thinking of inviting? 
Natalie grins a guilty smile. 
CHARLIE'S VOICE Sorry, Angels.     Our work is only half-done. 
DYLAN What? (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 46.

He tosses her the panic button. 
KNOX Stay for dinner. (preempting objections) I'm a pretty good cook. 
DYLAN I can't Mr. Knox. I'm sorry.     If you... 
KNOX (quickly) I'm scared. 
Dylan is surprised by this. 
KNOX (CONT'D) Look, I didn't want to admit it, but I am. I was kidnapped once, and it wasn't fun. I know, you probably have other plans, but it would be very reassuring. 
Dylan looks him over. Normally, she'd be suspicious, but the guy WAS just kidnapped, and he seems sincere. 
KNOX (CONT'D) Come on, don't make me beg. I'm embarrassed already. 
She smiles. 
DYLAN Don't be. 
She throws her coat back on the sofa. 
INT. KNOX LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
We PAN OFF a half-played Scrabble game to find Dylan and Knox at the windows. Dylan picks up a family photo, Knox as a little boy with a father in a military uniform. 
DYLAN That's you, hunh? Cute kid.    Cute family. 
KNOX Thanks. (taking the photo) It's the only picture I have of me with my parents. They died a week later. 
DYLAN Oh.   Oh, I'm sorry. I had no idea... 
(CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 47. 
CONTINUED: 
KNOX Please, don't apologize. I was too young to understand. (looking at the photo) I never knew how they died. When I was a kid, when I got shuffled from one foster home to another, I always thought they just disappeared. 
DYLAN But...? 
KNOX I only found out later, my father was in the military. He and my mother were killed while he was on assignment, somewhere in Eastern Europe. (mostly to himself) The files were classified, but I read enough to know that he was a good man. Apparently, he was betrayed by one of his own team. 
DYLAN Wow.   That's a lot for a kid to live with. 
KNOX Yeah, but it motivated me, losing my family. It still does. I don't take anything for granted. 
Dylan nods. 
DYLAN Boy did I have you pegged wrong. 
KNOX (intrigued) How do you mean? 
DYLAN Well, to be honest, I thought you were a rich kid who inherited everything. But that's pretty typical. I've got instincts for the job, but when it comes to men? Well... 
KNOX I'm glad you don't see me as just a client. 
He brushes his hand against hers.     She brushes back, fingers against fingers. A long beat.

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                   48.

DYLAN Oh.   Well, you ARE, so... 
KNOX Is there someone you need to be going home to? 
DYLAN No. (beat) But I... 
He kisses her. After a moment, she breaks off. It's not that it was a bad kiss. It was a damn good kiss. It's just... 
DYLAN (CONT'D) I shouldn't. 
Knox moves towards her. 
KNOX Shouldn't you? 
Dylan holds him back. 
DYLAN (firmly) No.   I shouldn't. 
She stands up. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) Thank you for dinner, Mr. Knox.    And lock the door behind me. 
She gets up and leaves. 
CUT TO: 
ANGLE ON Roger Corwin, driving his Mercedes.     He slows, a road crew working ahead. 
ANGLE ON Dylan, dressed in an orange vest, manning the slow/stop sign. She makes Corwin stop, leans in to apologize for the delay. 
Behind the Mercedes, Natalie sneaks up. She quickly picks the trunk lock, then quietly climbs in. She hoists in a large duffel bag, then shuts herself inside. 
INT. TRUNK OF CORWIN'S MERCEDES - DAY 
We HEAR the car moving again. 
Stripped down to a bra, Natalie attaches an illuminated mirror to the underside of the trunk lid. Starts to pull more items from her duffel bag: black shoes, a dress shirt, a tie. 
EXT. RED STAR - DAY 
Establishing. We see Corwin's Mercedes pull into the parking garage. 
INT. PARKING GARAGE / RED STAR - DAY 
Walking away from the car, Corwin hits the remote.    The Mercedes BWOOPS. 
A beat later, a hand comes out from under the trunk lid. Natalie climbs out, only she's not Natalie anymore. 
She's become Corwin -- identical to the last detail. 
She tucks the last of the latex mask under her collar as she walks. FREEZE FRAME. 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 57. 
INT. SECURITY STATION - DAY 
Corwin puts his right hand on the sensor grid.    A laser scans it. Approved. 
The Security Guard hits the button, releasing the gate. He goes back to his magazine as Corwin passes through. A beat, then... 
A VOICE Tommy? You gonna let me through or what? 
Tommy the Guard looks up, sees Corwin is still at the counter. 
TOMMY THE GUARD (confused) Oh.     Yeah, sorry Mr. Corwin. 
He hits the button again, letting Corwin through. Tommy goes back to his magazine, still a little perplexed. 
INT. SECURE HALLWAY - DAY 
The same places we saw on the videotape. Natalie-as- Corwin swipes the two stolen failsafe cards in a reader, sending the lights from red to green. FREEZE FRAME. 
She splices in a transmitter the size of a cigarette pack. Pulls up a tiny antenna. FREEZE FRAME. 
INT. SECURE HALLWAY - DAY 
Corwin walks down the hall, still talking with his colleague. Natalie-as-Corwin is walking right towards them. She turns away as she passes. He didn't even spot her. 
She smiles.

Astonished, Vivian Wu hits some keys, checking that what they say is true. 
DYLAN (to a passing waiter) Champagne, please. Your best. 
Smiling, Knox motions for them to take a seat. 
KNOX Now I know why I hired you.   You're the best. 
A look between the angels.      They know it's true. 
VIVIAN WU (to Knox, re: laptop) I'll have Systems get to work on this right away. 
She reaches for the laptop.      Bosley snatches it away. 
BOSLEY Uh, actually Miss Wu, WE will get to work on this right away. Any evidence we find will be turned over to you AND the proper authorities. 
VIVIAN WU I don't think you understand how important that data is, Mr... 
BOSLEY Oh, indeed I do. And that's why I'll take very good care of it when I find it. 
VIVIAN WU (reaching for the laptop) But... 
KNOX Vivian, please. Do as the man says. 
Reluctantly, Vivian Wu pulls her hand away. Bosley tucks the laptop into a steel briefcase, then stands. 
VIVIAN WU (ignoring him) The Angels will figure out they were duped. We can't afford them jeopardizing our plans. 
THE THIN MAN Here it comes... 
VIVIAN WU (coldly) We have to Kill Charlie's Angels. 
The Thin Man sighs, whips out his cell phone. 
THE THIN MAN Guess I'll cancel my weekend plans. 
And speaking of weekend plans...

ALEX Me too. 
JASON No, I mean, it's weird. It's weirding me out how happy I am when you're around. Am I sick or something? 
ALEX (smiling) Got me. 
JASON The only bummer is, I start to jones when you're not around. What the hell am I gonna do this weekend, if you're not with me? 
ALEX We'll get you some sedatives. You'll be fine. 
He stops, takes her in his arms. With the moonlight shining down, it's very romantic. They kiss. Then... 
JASON Hey.   Wait a second.   Come with me! 
ALEX Come with you? 
JASON Miami, on the Sony Jet. I've got two tickets to the Final Four. 
ALEX Jason, I don't... 
JASON Wait, before you say no, let me just say something, okay? I'm sick of how little we see each other. I'm sick of stealing a day here, or a week there. 
ALEX It's my job, Jason. I can't explain it, but I have to be on call, all the time, and... 
JASON What if I changed all that? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                  63.

BLAM!    BLAM!   Gunshots ring out! 
ALEX Gunfire!   Get down! 
Alex, in Angels mode, immediately throws him to the ground and covers him. She feels something wet, looks down to see Jason's chest, covered in blood. 
ALEX (CONT'D) My God, you're hit. You're... 
JASON Fine.  I'm fine. (he laughs) They're squibs, it's fake.   See? 
He wipes off a little, puts it on her tongue.     Finally convinced, she almost lets herself laugh. 
REVEAL 
that we are in a soundstage, the cobblestones street is just a set. The gunfire was coming from some effects guys, who are test firing guns for the upcoming action scene just outside the soundstage, visible through the open loading door. 
JASON (CONT'D) Fake guns, too. They're just setting up for the next scene. 
He helps her up. 
ALEX Sorry about that, I... 
JASON (smiling) God, I loved that. The way you yelled and everything? Baby, you been watching too many movies. (he kisses her on the nose) Alright, I gotta go reset these. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I want to finish this conversation. 
As he walks out of the soundstage, Alex is left behind, alone. She cleans herself off, shaking her head at her own paranoia. (CONTINUED)

ALEX Nice, Alex.   Real nice. 
THIPP! 
A wall next to her sprays a cloud of plaster.     Alex looks at the hole. That's strange. 
THIP, THIP! 
Two more little explosions, these barely missing her face. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Hey, is someone firing more squibs or... 
Suddenly, without warning, the wall is plastered with SILENCED GUNFIRE. It's only Alex's instincts that let her duck in time to avoid being turned into Swiss cheese. 
A DOOR LATCH 
CLICKS open. We TILT UP to see a WELL-DRESSED MAN.          He's at least 6'3". 
He stops at Natalie's stall door, drawing his gun.      A beat, then he KICKS the door open, revealing... 
AN EMPTY STALL. 
The automatic toilet FLUSHES itself.      The Man takes a half-step in, confused. Suddenly -- (CONTINUED)

The door swings back, SMASHING into his right hand.     He drops the gun, looking up to see 
NATALIE, 
Who is perched atop the stall walls.     She pushed the door with her foot. 
Grabbing an overhead pipe, she performs an acrobatic swing, landing both feet on the guy's head. He falls into the next row of stalls. 
Natalie reaches for the gun, but the Man grabs her ankles. He pulls her back across the tile floor, flipping her over. That just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts. 
With a scissors lock around his neck, Natalie is pulled up while the Man falls. She lands a knee on his windpipe. 
NATALIE Who do you work for? 
He tries to pull her off.    She leans in harder. 
NATALIE (CONT'D) Speak now or never again. 
THE MAN (motioning with eyes) Jacket pocket. 
Suspicious, she digs inside his coat to pull out a leather billfold. Flips it open to reveal an I.D. that reads... 
NATALIE National Security Agency?   You're with the NSA? 
THE MAN I've been following you. I didn't know which side you were on. (beat) This is bigger than you think. 
INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT 
The anime classic is playing. Pete keeps looking back towards the door. He's been ditched again. Just when he's about to give up hope, Natalie is there. 
NATALIE I'm so sorry, but I have to go. I can't explain. (hands card) This is my cell phone number. Please call me tomorrow. Please. I'm sorry. (CONTINUED)

EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT 
Dylan and Knox walk hand in hand up a quaint, woodsy path behind Knox's home. We can hear music drifting up from the hill in front of them. 
DYLAN Where's that music coming from? 
KNOX You'll see.    Just a little farther. 
He helps her up a steep part of the path.       As she comes over the crest of a hill. 
DYLAN Oh... (taking in the view) Oh wow. 
DYLAN'S POV -- 
The hill behind Knox's house has a magnificent view right into the Hollywood Bowl. The music is the symphony playing something very romantic. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) That's amazing. 
They stand there, together, just listening to the music, Knox watching her reaction closely. 
KNOX Can I ask you a personal question? 
DYLAN Maybe. 
KNOX How much do you know about Charlie? 
Dylan seems surprised by this question. 
KNOX (CONT'D) I just find it strange that you work for a man you've never met. 
DYLAN Well, I don't know what he looks like, but I feel like I know him. We all do. (CONTINUED)

DYLAN Nope. 
KNOX And you're never curious to find out? 
DYLAN Of course, but believe me, it's impossible. I've tried. (beat) Let's not talk about Charlie, okay? Or work. 
She smiles t him, motioning for them to go back up to Knox's house. 
CLOSE ON Dylan.      What does that mean? 
Vivian snaps her phone shut.

Dylan stands up.    What the hell is going on? 
Vivian draws the gun on her.    Knox moves over toward Vivian's side. 
KNOX Sorry Dylan. I knew this moment would come sooner or later. I was just hoping for later. 
A long beat, Dylan trying to wrap her head around this. 
DYLAN All this time, we thought Red Star was behind this, but it was you. (realizing) You faked your kidnapping. 
Knox taps his nose.    She's got it. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) Why? 
KNOX To gain your trust. And get your help. (beat) I want you to know, my personal attraction to you was a sincere and unrelated complication. 
DYLAN Oh, well, in that case I feel a lot better about you being a lying pole smoker. 
Dylan looks like she's about to leap forward and tear Knox's throat out. Vivian gestures for Dylan to keep stepping back. 
DYLAN (CONT'D) I can't believe I trusted you. 
KNOX Why not? You trust Charlie and you've never even met him. 
Dylan crosses the sill, out onto the balcony.

How right he is, because as soon as Vivian squeezes the trigger... 
Dylan drops to the floor, then rolls. 
BLAM! 
the bullet misses Dylan and slams into the bulletproof window causing a spider-web crack to spread. Dylan sees her opportunity and heads right for the window while Vivian pumps off shots. 
As she comes to the window, Dylan jumps up in the air and does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the bullet impacted. 
SMASH! 
The bulletproof glass shatters outward, and Dylan flies out the window, onto the ledge. 
KNOX (CONT'D) Wow. (to Vivian) I've never seen YOU do something like that. 
VIVIAN WU Oh, shut up.

EXT. BALCONY - NIGHT 
Dylan looks over the edge of the balcony. The drop-off is incredibly steep -- the house is built on stilts -- and the fall looks like it would kill her. But she doesn't have much choice.

The two of them head back inside.    As they do... 
We hold on the railing, then slowly start to drift down, to the underside of the balcony. Dylan has attached her belt to the bottom of the railing, and is hanging in the rafters. As she pulls herself back up... WIPE TO: 
EXT. AIRPORT -- NIGHT 
A black sedan pulls onto the tarmac. Knox and Vivian Wu emerge, then hustle into a waiting private plane. 
INT. ANGELS DETECTIVE AGENCY 
Natalie, Dylan and Alex nurse their wounds and compare notes. 
DYLAN I can't believe Knox tried to kill me. I mean, I've been lied to, I've been cheated on, but no guy has ever tried to SHOOT me before. (coldly) I'm gonna get him for that. 
EXT. RUINS OF TOWNSEND AGENCY - DAY 
The angels still can't believe they're hearing his voice. 
DYLAN Can we trace him? 
NATALIE Not off a boosted signal. We'd have to be within 20 miles. 
ALEX Come on, Bosley. Tell us where you are. 
INT. COMPOUND TOWER - DAY 
BOSLEY I don't know where I am, really. I'm in a round room. The walls are white. Well. Not white-white. More of a cream, or an eggshell. Vanilla. Yes, I'm going to say vanilla.

The bird Bosley was whistling to lands on the TV, looks at the transmitter, curious. SINGS its song. 
BOSLEY Wherever it is, they have really good pudding. 
Natalie holds up a finger -- stop. 
DYLAN (incredulous) What, pudding? 
The bird SINGS its song again.      Natalie smiles.

INT. KNOX COMPOUND - DAY 
The Thin Man signals to the Henchmen. Two of them force Dylan to sit in one of the wooden deck chairs. 
Then, with the thick packing tape, they begin binding her arms to the arms of the chair. As they do: 
DYLAN I don't know why you bother.   I've already won. 
THIN MAN Is that so? 
DYLAN Every moment I sit here is a moment I'm using to figure out how to take you down. In fact, this statement -- this one I'm making right here-- is just me stalling for time while I decide which of your goons I'm going to flatten first. (whispering) It's gonna be the guy behind me. 
The Thin Man can't help but be amused. After all, there are six guards and one blonde -- who is now taped to a chair.

Cliche as that sounds. (then to the last two) Last, you guys -- hell, I'll make something up. We'll have fun. 
The Thin Man smirks oh-so-confidently. 
THE THIN MAN And what will you do to me? 
DYLAN You won't even be here. I mean, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but you should've killed me by now. Because I already know that your people are onto my people, which means any moment now you're going to be called out to go and deal -- 
Suddenly the door flies open and --

The Thin Man starts edging Alex towards some emergency exit doors, gun still in her back. Alex is trying to think of an escape, quickly. She knows that the second he gets her out of this public space, he's gonna shoot her. The door gets closer and closer... 
JASON (O.S.) Alex?!   Jesus, what is going on? 
The Thin Man and Alex turn around to face Jason, who is sweaty and exasperated from chasing her. 
ALEX Jason, hi, I... 
The Thin Man digs the gun deeper into her back. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Can I talk to you later? 
JASON No you can talk to me NOW. I want to know what the hell is going on. First, you disappear with no explanation, not even a goodbye. 
ALEX I'm sorry, I... 
JASON Now, I see you here, but you're with some other guy. 
THIN MAN Hey, movie star, do yourself a favor and get lost. 
Jason double takes.     He's not used to someone talking to him like that. 
JASON Lemme guess.   You must be Charlie? 
ALEX Jason, please... (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                               95. 
CONTINUED: JASON No, no I'm sick of this shit. I'm sick of this asshole telling you what you can and can't do. 
And then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the Thin Man. 
Now, Jason's just an actor, not an ass-kicking super detective, so his punch isn't all that great. In fact, it leaves Jason shaking his hand in pain. 
The Thin Man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, smiles. 
Alex, still searching for Charlie, notices something strange. 
ALEX You're kidding me. 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                98. 
NATALIE 
is fully transformed on the court, from wallflower to full- out cheerleader. It's not that she's as good as the other cheerleaders. She's better. 
ON THE COURT 
The SONG ends. The Cheerleaders vacate the court, but Natalie keeps dancing her heart out. She has 18,000 fans watching her, and she's totally in the moment. But there's another agenda as well... 
COURTSIDE RADIO ANNOUNCER The time out is over, but one cheerleader doesn't seem to notice. Officials can't start the clock again while she's on the court. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MIAMI ARENA -- CONTINUOUS 
Dylan has picked two wires. 
DYLAN Chartreuse and magenta.   This has gotta be it. 
She prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when... 
KNOX (O.S.) I wouldn't do that, if I were you. 
She spins to see Knox, standing behind her. 
KNOX (CONT'D) See, if you snip ANY of those wires, the bomb WILL blow up. 
DYLAN It's gonna blow anyway, once the clock gets to zero. 
KNOX Who told you that, my idiotic henchman? Do you think I tell him ANYTHING that's confidential? 
He holds up a small TRIGGERING DEVICE. It's the same one we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene. 
KNOX (CONT'D) THIS is what triggers that bomb.     So if you'll kindly step away, I'll refrain from killing both of us. 
(CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                             99. 
CONTINUED: Realizing she has no choice, Dylan stands up and backs away. 
KNOX (CONT'D) In different circumstances, Dylan, I think you and I could have worked out. We have a lot in common. 
DYLAN Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you ARE one. 
Knox laughs. 
KNOX Good one. (beat, as he backs up) Well, I must be going. If you like your body parts attached to your torso, I suggest you do the same. 
Knox turns to go, but the other Angels are blocking his way. 
ALEX Give it up, Knox. You're surrounded. 
NATALIE Give us the detonator. 
KNOX NO! 
Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high. 
KNOX (CONT'D) I'll blow this building sky high, I swear! 
CHARLIE (O.S.) Don't do it, Eric. It's me you want, not all these innocent people. 
Everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows. 
KNOX Charlie? 
That's right, it's Charlie. Finally, after all these years, we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing. 
He's not what we expected. Short, portly, dressed in a "We're #1" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by Charlie's appearance. 
ANGELS Charlie? 
Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                                 100. 
CONTINUED: 
CHARLIE Your father was a double agent, Eric. Yes, I revealed him, but he was killed by his own people before we could throw him in jail. (beat) He was my friend. 
KNOX It's still your fault, you arrogant prick! You still killed my father! 
CHARLIE Maybe. Maybe I did. But why should YOU kill all these people? If you hate me so much, just shoot ME. Just shoot me, Eric. 
Charlie spreads his arms, leaving Knox a plenty wide target. 
It's a horribly tense moment.       The Angels are frozen, watching Knox decide Charlie's fate. 
Knox is sweating, debating his choices. Can he really do this? Charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined. He starts lowering his gun. 
KNOX Okay.  You're right. (quickly) I'll just kill you.

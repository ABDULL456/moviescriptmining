HAPPY FEET

(Early Draft) 
SPACE 
Distant STARS, with vast tracts of darkness stretching between them. Move in on OUR SUN, dwarfed in the immense cosmic ocean. 
MUMBLE (VO) You ever feel small? 
Moving in on.... 
PLANET EARTH 
The spinning blue marble. 
FADE IN: A strange cacophony of MUSIC, growing louder as the familiar CONTINENTS revolve below us and we spiral down onto ANTARCTICA 
THE ICE SHELF 
Vast, pristine, stupendous. Washed with dawn light. A few small BLACK-SUITED FIGURES are moving towards us. 
MUMBLE (VO) Like you're no-one, cos the world is full of us, and everyone's the same 
Wait a minute. These aren't humans... they are PENGUINS! 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) How do you stand out from the crowd? How do you find someone special? 
A GREAT COMMUNITY 
EMPEROR PENGUINS all over the place, Its chaos - Grand central station - with everyone SINGING to each other. 
MUMBLE (VO) I know. I know. "You sing your heart out." That's how mum found dad in the first place 
Follow a female penguin as she waddles through the massive crowd past an assortment of crooning males 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
KEEN MALE (trying to connect) "Babe...I got you Babe..." 
She ignores him 
NEXT MALE (giving it his all) "When a man loves a woman..." 
She keeps moving, until she sees the male of her dreams: 
WISHFUL "Love me tender love me true, all my dreams fulfil. 
He stands a bit apart from the rest. And what a voice. What a hip movement. She sings along. 
NORMA J. AND WISHFUL ...for my darling I love you and I always will. 
MUMBLE (VO) With them it was love at first song. 
Close up on the two penguins as their necks intertwine. 
MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D) But with me everything was a different, right from the moment I was born 
As the chanting builds, a little thought-bubble appears next to the communal imagination: An image of Norma J 
NORMA J. (Sings) "I wanna be loved by you, alone and nobody else by you boo boo pee doo" 
WISHFUL raises his head, breaking the seal. A little puff of steam escapes 
WISHFUL Amen to that honey 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
VARIOUS PENGUINS Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa, pal! Ya lettin' out the heat! 
Penguins around him start jostling to close the gap 
PENGUINS ...Quit shovin'! ...Hey watch where you're putting your feet 
CARUSO Brothers, BROTHERS! The Devotions! 
An egg rolls out of the HUDDLE and onto the ICE. 
WISHFUL Oh no! I dropped it! Where's my egg! 
WISHFUL barges out of the huddle, retrieves the egg and waddles back into the warmth again. 
WISHFUL (CONT'D) S'okay. S'okay. No harm done. 
MUMBLE (VO) I guess he was wrong about a lot of things. 
Pulling back, till the powerful rhythmic chanting is drowned out by the HOWLING GALE. 
WISHFUL But I did learnt this from him:    the power of positive thinking 
We are moving in again, towards the huddle, the voices of the Great Male Gathering begin to cut through the wind blasts. 
Louder and louder, until... 
ELDER By the power of our Devotions... 
ALL PENGUINS We turn the world once more. 
ELDER By our devotion to the Wisdoms 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
ALL PENGUINS We bring back the sun. 
The CHANTING crescendos, awe-inspiring, as it rises above the sound of the gale, and, as if in response 
THE EARTH TURNS! 
The CURTAIN OF DARKNESS which overshadows Antarctica begins to LIFT from the curvature of the southern hemisphere. The vast ice-continent is BRILLIANTLY ILLUMINATED once more. 
ON THE ICE SHELF 
The ICE itself is moaning and groaning, like a living thing. 
A SINGLE CRACK appears and widens, then forks and forks again. 
The whole expanse of fast-ice is DISINTEGRATING, starting at the sea-ice and progressing towards the ice-cliffs. 
Somewhere an ICEBERG breaks free from the face of a glacier and smashes down into the frozen sea below. At the same time... 
THE EMPEROR COMMUNITY 
An EGG cracks open, then another, then all in a rush, like POPCORN. 
MICK Me! Me! I've got one! (sings) "I can't get no...satisfaction.... I can't get no...girly action..." 
TEACHER Well Michael, if you think that's really you. What have you got for us, Ella? 
ELLA (sings) Voulez-vous coucher avec moi...ce soir? 
MUMBLE (laughs) That doesn't make any sense. 
TEACHER Well Mumble...perhaps you can do better 
MUMBLE Mine is more sort of a... 
He hesitates, as if listening to something in his head.Then, he sings UTTERLY TUNELESS, like a drum solo. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Bim bam-a-loolah a bim bam bom 
TEACHER You heard that in there? 
Mumble is still going. TITTERS and SNIGGERS from the class. 
MUMBLE You like it? 
TEACHER Dear, that's not even a tune. 
MUMBLE It's not? 
TEACHER No, a tune is like... (she sings a scale) La la la la la la la la. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
MUMBLE Oh, La la la la la 
A croaky monotone.   The class LAUGHS OPENLY. 
TEACHER (getting worried) Listen carefully, Mumble. La la la la la la la la!! 
MUMBLE La la la la la la la la!! 
TEACHER (emphatically) La La La La La La La La! 
MUMBLE But that's what I'm doing, 
The class fall about in HYSTERICS. 
MUMBLE (VO) (CONT'D) Whats funny? (genuinely perplexed) What's funny? 
LATER 
MUMBLE's PARENTS are talking to the TEACHER. 
TEACHER (sotto) It's bizarre. I don't understand it. Did anything happen - you know...- during early development? 
NORMA J. No. All fine. Normal incubation, wasn't it honey? 
Wishful shuffles guiltily. 
WISHFUL Well Yeah, it was a kinda...a tough winter I guess, and he did hatch a little late, but... (at a loss.) Is there really nothing we can do? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TEACHER Of course there is. Thats why we have Mrs Astrakhan. 
MRS ASTRAKHAN'S 
Some distance from the creche, MUMBLE stands with MRS ASTRAKHAN, a Russian-accented remedial teacher. 
He stops some distance away, listening to the other kids who are now performing with increasing virtuosity. 
Ella is among them, her clear high voice borne to him on the wind. 
Mumble sighs and his little shoulders sink, no way he'll ever be able to sing like that. 
MUMBLE Its tough when you realise you'll never fit in. Plus I was beginning to moult 
A piece of downy fluff is peeling off one wing 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) I couldn't face the class in this mood So I just kept going. 
Music over: Walk on By as he wanders through the vast colony head down against the wind, little feet padding over the ice, 
Gradually the colony begins to thin. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Looking for what? I don't know? A different type of penguin? 
The noise of the colony has faded behind him. He stops and looks up. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) And that's exactly what I found. 
THE EDGE 
Before him, a wasteland of discoloured ice covered with broken eggs and bits of feather. There are very few penguins here and the ones he can see are all, frankly, weird. 
A Penguin walks in an endless figure of eight muttering to himself. Another has his flippers wrapped tightly around himself like a straightjacket. A troubled Penguin sings angrily..."There's no business like show business. 
CU on Mumble. As he looks back to the sanctuary of the colony and then back out over the wasteland 
MUMBLE Not the nicest place in the world but at least you could do what you liked here. 
Fade in Music: (I'm Free by the Who) and Mumble is off, skittering over the rubbish strewn ice, little feet dancing to his hearts content until.... 
a shadow passes over him and 
Whump! a huge SKUA BIRD, twice Mumbles size, with a cruel flesh-eating beak, lands on the ice right on front of him. 
SKUA Hey, whacha doin' dere flipperbird? 
MUMBLE Me? Oh, nothing. What are you doing? 
THREE MORE SKUAS descend. MUMBLE is surrounded. 
SKUA#1 Oh we just dropped in for a spota lunch. Hey hey hey... 
MUMBLE (hopefully) Lunch?...There's food? Here? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
SKUA#1 (to others) Leg or wing? 
Their dark eyes fix on Mumble. He is starting to feel uneasy and backs away. 
MUMBLE But ...but. I'm a penguin. 
SKUA#1 Exackly! De flipperbirds - dat's you - eat de fish. De flyinbirds - dat's me - eat de flipperbird an' de fish. Right now D'ain't no fish -- so...you do the math. 
The FIRST SKUA moves in on MUMBLE. 
FIRST SKUA And dis time I'm getting the juicy bits. 
MUMBLE I don't have juicy bits! Look... all bone and feather! Feel for yourself. 
He opens his beak wide as MUMBLE stumbles backwards and falls into a narrow CREVICE in the ice. 
FIRST SKUA (CONT'D) Hey! Whatcha think ya doin' down dere flipperbird? Get back up here dis minute! 
The other Skuas move in to help. MUMBLE cowers in the CRACK as they spear at him with their beaks. 
SKUAS ...Come on, out witcha! ...Ya sneaky-ass flipperbird! 
They can't get hold of him. Frustrated, they turn on the FIRST SKUA, squabbling and whacking each other with their wings. 
SKUAS (CONT'D) ...Great, Yellaleg. ...What did we tell ya ...ya leddim geddaway, dincha with ya screwy alientalk. 
FIRST SKUA Hey, Don't peck me or I'll peck you and when I peck you know you've been pecked...(fade) 
MUMBLE watches from the safety of the crack as they fight and argue viciously among themselves 
MUMBLE (VO) Compared with that, school almost seemed like fun 
THE CRECHE 
MUMBLE stands some distance back from where the other young penguins are taking school lessons. 
MUMBLE (V.O.) Most days I hid at the back, dreaming about the world beyond 
MUMBLE looks up at a cloud that resolves itself into the unmistakable shape of a FISH. As he watches, the cloud morphs into something that resembles a WHALE. Then morphs again into...a SEAL. Then into the shape of an upright CREATURE with bulging eyes and tentacled hands. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MUMBLE Time passed. We all grew up 
TIME LAPSE 
As the class transforms into moulting adolescents 
MUMBLE (V.O.) But right up to graduation I never did find my heartsong 
LATER. THE GRADUATION CEREMONY 
Dozens of MATURE ADOLESCENTS...their coats almost fully moulted to reveal the sleek, shiny black and white feathers underneath. 
They stand in a group talking excitedly until the lead penguin, Caruso, walks up and everyone falls silent 
CARUSO Graduates, today you leave the safety of our community for the first time, forsaking the trusted solid ice for the terrible magic of the deep. 
MUMBLE (VO) Caruso. He couldn't help himself. 
CARUSO. Things are not as they were. For five years now we have known nothing but famine. But you are our hope. Upon your survival depends the very future of the entire Penguin Nation. Dive deep, swim far. May the Great Penguinus go with you. And remember... 
With solemn gravity, CARUSO throws his flippers into the air and shouts. 
CARUSO Excelsi-yah! Yah yah yah! 
MASSED GRADUATES Excelsi-yah ! Yah yah yah! 
AWAY FROM THE CRECHE 
Follow Mumble as he returns to his parents. In his adult plumage he's distinguishable by a small birthmark, like a bowtie on his chest and a small tuft of down on his head which has not yet moulted off. 
Music Over: Schools Out by Alice Cooper 
MUMBLE Dad, Ma, can I go with the others 
NORMA J. puts a protective flipper around her son. 
NORMA-J I don't know Wishful. I still don't think he's ready. 
ELLA Mumble? 
They tentatively crane over the edge. No sign of him. They peer into the water. 
GRADUATE ...Lunatic! ...where did he go? ...See any blood? 
Then...MUMBLE shoots out of the water like a missile... 
MUMBLE Whatcha waiting for? It's fantast...(splosh) 
... as he falls back under water again. 
ELLA Go Mumble! 
Without hesitation ELLA follows him. 
The others follow ELLA. A few at first, then all of them en masse leap yelling and hollering. 
SURFACE/ UNDERWATER 
The penguins flounder around, flapping, laughing, and choking 
MUMBLE I had an instinct I'd be good at this. Actually we all were. We were the best. 
UNDERWATER 
Transformed into creatures of grace and exuberance, they swoop and dive trailing plumes of bubbles. 
Over this: the music of THE BEACH BOYS. 
BEACH BOYS "Suntanned bodies and the waves of sunshine. Those California girls and the beautiful coastline. In the warmed up weather, let's get together and do it again..." 
Two PENGUINS shoot up through HOLES IN THE ICE... 
THE SURFACE 
Skidding out of control, they COLLIDE, ending up in a breathless heap on top of each other. 
ELLA Mumble? 
MUMBLE Ella? 
They scramble to their feet...but the ice is slippery.They clutch together, slipping and sliding. 
ELLA Woah! 
MUMBLE I've got you! No I don't. 
Leaning against each other, they manage to stand up, close now, eyes meeting. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Yes I do. 
A brief moment then. 
MALE PENGUIN Hi Ella. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MUMBLE (V.O.) The only bad thing about being with Ella. It was always so darned crowded. 
As others pop up all around 
MALE PENGUINS ...Ella! ...Where da get to? ...there you are! 
Laughing, she dives into the water. The young males follow her. MUMBLE hippity-hops to the edge and tumbles in after her. 
MUMBLE (spent) You're welcome. 
ON AN ICEBERG. NIGHT 
The entire sky is ablaze with the shimmering LIGHTS of the AURORA AUSTRALIS. 
The PENGUINS stand below, looking up in wonder. They sing: 
ELLA AND THE OTHERS "Gotta keep those lovin' good Vibrations a happenin' with her, "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh..." 
The HARMONIES are exquisite until... 
MUMBLE (very loud and tuneless) "...Good, Good, Good...Good VibRatiOns..." 
The singing STOPS. 
MALE PENGUINS ...Mumble, ...Knock it off. 
The singing RESUMES. 
ELLA AND THE CHOIR "Gotta keep those lovin' good Vibrations A happenin' with her." 
Another CRESCENDO... 
ELLA AND THE CHOIR (CONT'D) "Ahhh..." 
It's too much for MUMBLE. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MUMBLE "...AaahhhhHhhhhhhhhhhhhHhhhhhh..." 
This stops the whole thing dead. ELLA pads over to him. 
ELLA (gently) Mumble, the thing is... 
MUMBLE I know. I know 
ELLA ....It's better if you just listen. 
She returns to the choir. The singing resumes...a perfect harmonic MUMBLE can't help himself. He begins to TAP DANCE. 
ELLA AND THE OTHERS MUMBLE!!! 
MUMBLE (retreating) OK! I'll quit. OK! 
AN ICE-FLOE 
We find MUMBLE on his own small ice-floe separate from the others on their iceberg. 
As their singing drifts across to him, MUMBLE does an exquisite little SOFT-SHOE SHUFFLE. 
TIME LAPSE 
As night slowly pales to a misty dawn and Mumbles lonely floe drifts off, turning slowly in the current 
Music Over: "The tracks of my tears" 
MORNING 
He is woken by A NUDGE at his little raft of ice. 
MUMBLE (sleepily) Woah. Whose there. 
Another nudge. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
AN ADELIE That thing with The feet. (to the others) ¡Hola muchachos! (to Mumble) Show them! 
MUMBLE Well...I just kind of go ...like this...and then this... 
Bolder now, he does a few neat steps. 
THE ADELIES ...¡Oye! Ritmo Cubana! ...¡Riba Riba! Shake those hips! ...Yo penguino, bust a move! 
They COPY HIM, improvising little riffs on his dance step. The LEOPARD SEAL inches up behind them. 
THE ADELIES (CONT'D) ...Then mebbe something like... ...No. I got it. Watch me! 
An Adelie adds an ACROBATIC variation of his own. The LEOPARD SEAL is almost upon them. 
MUMBLE Or how about ... 
MUMBLE adds a neatly executed slide just as the LEOPARD SEAL strikes. MUMBLE avoids the lunge and the creature's face comes down hard on the ice 
THE ADELIES (to the winded Seal) ...Eat my ice, lardface. ...Kiss my frozen toosh, rubber butt 
They fall about laughing. The Leopard Seal returns to the water. 
LEOPARD SEAL I know where you live. 
THE ADELIES ...Yeah, it's called The Land, tubby. ...Flop back anytime! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
Laughing hysterically at their own jokes they strut off. MUMBLE watches them go. 
ADELIES ...Hey, ain't you coming, tallboy? ...Or you got something better to do? 
MUMBLE looks out at the endless sea of floating ice-pancakes, all the way to the horizon. Nothing... 
He shrugs and hurries off after his new friends. 
FURTHER ON 
A strange cacophony building as The four ADELIE AMIGOS and MUMBLE crest the rise, to see... 
ADELIE LAND 
A vast, boisterous ADELIE PENGUIN COMMUNITY. Thousands of them, stretching as far as the eye can see. Its very Rio, very samba, worlds away from the sedate Emperor colony. 
MUMBLE Wow, there are so many of you! 
THE ADELIES ...Hey, this is nothin'. ...Used to be twice as many of us. ...Yeah, back when you could still catch a fish. 
MUMBLE The shortage has affected you too?! 
AN ADELIE ...Who you calling shortish? ...All I know is a lot of us ain't comin' back. ....And Some folks so hungry they eating rocks 
Sure enough An ADELIE walks by, a PEBBLE in his beak. 
THE ADELIES (laughing) ...Eating rocks!!? ...That is major funny. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MUMBLE Why funny? That's terrible 
ADELIES ...Just kidding the rocks are for nest- building ...That's how its works here. The one with the most rocks gets the chicas. ..Chica boom chica boom chica boom boom BOOM! 
MUMBLE So why aren't you guys collecting them 
UNDERWATER 
The Adelies shoot back up to the surface. Mumble sinks, slightly dazed, watching the kalaeidescope patters of the surface recede. 
Music Over: "Ground Control to major Tom" 
ON THE SURFACE 
ADELIES ...Where's the tall-boy ...I thought he was with you. 
They jump back in to look for him 
UNDERWATER 
Mumble keeps sinking, down down down into a great cathedral- like space, lit by eerie shards of underwater light. 
MUMBLE ....stuff down there beyond my wildest imagining. 
Imbedded in the base of the glacier, the rusting remains of, An OLD YELLOW EXCAVATOR projecting out of the glacier. 
It hangs there, inscrutable, like a great yellow totem. 
Mumble, dwarfed by it, contemplates it for a while, then ventures inside, into the body of the BEAST. 
INSIDE THE BULLDOZER 
A rusting steering column, a perforated dashboard. 
He pecks at the metal, trying to taste it, listening to the sound it makes. 
OUTSIDE THE BULLDOZER 
In the shimmering space outside the bulldozer, the ADELIES congregate. 
THE ADELIES ... You sure he went in there? ...Mumble! ...Done go near it, looks like it can bite 
One of them smims closer to the great jaws 
ADELIES Ramos! 
Mumble pops his head out from between the jaws 
MUMBLE Oh! There you are 
Terrified the Adelies scatter and shoot to the surface like missiles. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Guys!    I want to speak to you. 
THE ICE SHELF 
The Adelies are heading back to their colony as fast as their little legs will carry then. Mumble Hippity hops after them 
ADELIES ...Forget it ...We're not going back there ...Never 
MUMBLE But its dead. It can't hurt you 
ADELIES ...Maybe its got a brother still alive. 
MUMBLE But that's what we have to find out. Don't you see. Things like that could be eating the fish. 
The idea is so stunningly original it stops them in their tracks. 
ADELIES Okay. Okay. Here's the plan: we go and ask the revered one. 
MUMBLE The who? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
MUMBLE Did they have frontways eyes? No feathers? Fat flabby faces? Did they probe you and stick a pointy thing into you? 
LOVEDAY Enough! How many questions is that? You don't have enough pebbles. 
ADELIES IN QUEUE ...Yeah, one pebble, one question. ...We've all got stuff to ask, pal! 
MUMBLE But I haven't had any answers yet! 
LOVEDAY SILENCIO!! The Mystic Beings are speaking. They say show some respect stranger. Especially to the One who Knows. 
A hush falls over the gathering. 
LOVEDAY (CONT'D) The reason there are not enough fish is simple: There is not enough love in the world. Love is the answer! 
One cue the gospel choir start singing: All you need is Love 
LOVEDAY (CONT'D) (over this) Okay, everybody, turn around to the penguin next to you and give them a great big hug. Comeon, everybody...hug! This is a safe place. 
The gathering hug awkwardly. Mumble, because of his towering height, has trouble embracing the Adelie next to him. 
LOVEDAY (CONT'D) Now. The Mating Season starts today so here's what everybody should do: go forth and multiply! If you'll excuse I myself must retire for a moment to the couch of indulgence... okay ladies, who's gonna be first 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
MUMBLE and the ADELIES are jostled aside in the STAMPEDE of FEMALES as the gospel group break ranks and mob him 
FEMALE ADELIES ..Me Loveday. ..Me! ..No Me ! 
LOVEDAY One at a time! And don't touch the Talisman! 
ADELIES ....I liked him better when he was just plain Pedro. ...Did he say it starts today ...why didn't someone tell us. ...We gotta get to work guys!! 
They start posturing for the any FEMALES they can attract 
THE ADELIES ...¡Hola Baby! Get your chica boom-boom here. ... Turn round, look at us!. 
A couple of females look up from the scrum 
FEMALE ...How many rocks you got. 
HER FRIEND ...Forget `em honey. They only one between the six of them...and they just spent it. 
AN ADELIE (getting desperate) Wait. Look. 
The Adelies all start DANCING MADLY, but it is too frenetic, too desperate. 
ADELIES ...You like it ...Arriba! ...What do you need stones for 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) 
FEMALE FRIEND Try sitting on the ice for a month. It might come to you Salsa Boy. Come on, Consuela. 
Rejected, the Amigos stop dancing. 
THE ADELIES ...Their loss, guys. ...Ramon, where you going? 
Ramon is SEARCHING frantically for PEBBLES. 
RAMON Gotta be some rocks left here somewhere! (to Mumble) Hey big guy, got any love stones over where you come from? 
MUMBLE We don't collect them. All we have to do is , well... We sing 
AN ADELIE ...Easy as that? ...So why aren't you over there? 
ELLA (shakes her head, tearful) When you left without saying goodbye I thought something had happened, then I thought he just doesn't care. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
MUMBLE Don't care? I never stopped thinking about you. 
ELLA And then when I saw you singing, for a second I thought... 
MUMBLE I can't sing. 
ELLA I know. I know. Its impossible. 
She walks off. 
MUMBLE But I'll show you something better 
He TAPS an up-tempo, syncopated rhythm on the ice. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Sing something to this! 
ELLA (her back to him) What's the point. It's embarrassing 
MUMBLE Just try it. This once. 
Ella begins to hum Never Can Say Goodbye ironically and without conviction. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Okay, that'll work. Just keep it going. 
The singing ADELIE joins in...acapella, very rhythmic 
THE ADELIE "...turn around you fool You know I love you more and more..." 
Right on cue, the rest of the AMIGOS appear on either side of him, singing back-up. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
THE ADELIES "Tell me why is it so Don't wanna let you go I never can say goodbye, no...no no no..." 
Curious, ELLA TURNS. 
Framed between the Adelies, Mumble strikes a pose, holds it for a moment... then lets rip. 
He TAP DANCES...UNINHIBITED, WILD, JOYOUS. The ADELIES accompany him. They know all the moves and it is INFECTIOUS 
FEET are beginning to tap, couples are beginning to improvise... singing along, trying out the dance steps. 
Now ELLA is caught up in it. AND MUMBLE IS DANCING LIKE NO PENGUIN HAS EVER DONE BEFORE! 
MUMBLE This is it Ella! This is the song inside me! 
ELLA is ecstatic. Just when we think the WHOLE COLONY will be swept up into the abandon. A DARK FIGURE steps forward 
CARUSO (bellows) STOP...THIS...DEPRAVITY!!! 
ELLA STOPS DANCING. MUMBLE misses a beat, loses his footing, trips and goes sliding across the ice to the feet of CARUSO and the ELDERS. 
CARUSO (CONT'D) WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS ABOMINATION?!! 
MUMBLE I'm just showing them Happy Feet 
CARUSO Happy WHAT?! This is an OUTRAGE! 
The ADELIES shuffle uncomfortably. Caruso turns to the rest of the emperors 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
MUMBLE Give me a year, just until the next great gathering. If I don't make it back ....at least I tried 
ELLA But... 
MUMBLE Now go back. I love you. Go. 
Ella returns to the community. As she does so, CARUSO begins to CHANT the Gathering answers. 
CARUSO "Together we stand" 
ALL "Divided we freeze." 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (7) 
ALL (CONT'D) Recite the Wisdoms! 
ALL (CONT'D) "In the Wisdoms we trust." 
CARUSO "When all others leave..." 
ALL "We Remain." 
CARUSO Louder. More fervent bretheren. "When the Sun vanishes..." 
ALL "We Remain." 
ELLAS watches through tears as the tiny figures of Mumble and the Adelies dwindle to specks and disappear into the mist. 
THE ICE SHELF 
Mumble and the Adelies have put the colony far behind, trekking homewards 
ADELIES Tell me again where we're going. 
MUMBLE To find the mystic beings. 
ADELIES How do we know where they live. 
MUMBLE We'll ask Loveday. He's been there. 
ADELIELAND 
Most of the Adelies are sitting on nests. The Adeleies and Mumble trek past them a protective mother takes a peck at them. 
MOTHER ...Not so close. We got babies on board 
ADELIES ...Wow. Does nesting make em touchy 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
They find LOVEDAY at the back of what is left of his PEBBLE PILE. He sits leaning against it...exhausted. 
THE ADELIES ...LOVEDAY, you okay?? ...what happened ...Too much boom-boom for one penguin? 
MUMBLE kicks a bunch of pebbles at him. 
MUMBLE Just one question! And I want a straight answer! Where do I find the Mystic Beings? 
LOVEDAY tries to raise himself up. A tight low gurgling rumbles from his throat. 
AN ADELIE Why don't he speak? 
LOVEDAY gurgles and points wildly to the SIX-PACK PLASTIC round his neck. 
AN ADELIE (CONT'D) Talisman...sounds like Talisman!! 
LOVEDAY nods and points towards the mountains. 
AN ADELIE (CONT'D) He wants to go to the top of the mountain. 
LOVEDAY shakes his head. 
MUMBLE The forbidden place is over the mountains... 
LOVEDAY nods. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) ...In the land of the Elephant Seals!!? 
LOVEDAY gestures wildly with his flippers! 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) ...Beyond the land of the Elephant Seals!!? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (4) 
LOVEDAY nods `YES!!' and falls back in exhaustion. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) So who's coming 
LOVEDAY Oi 
A MOUNTAIN RIDGE 
The Adelies labour uphill into the wind. LOVEDAY is lagging behind, breathing hard. 
Even MUMBLE and the AMIGOS are puffing with the effort of the climb. 
Music Over: He aint heavy he's my brother. 
ADELIES ...Stop. Enough. We must've gone past it ...Past? Don't kid me. We're not even close. 
Then on the wind comes a fiant `Oi, Oi, Oi'. 
MUMBLE Hear that?! 
As they crest the peak, sure enough, down below: the LAND of the ELEPHANT SEALS. Thousands of them. 
THE ADELIES ...Refresh my memory do elephant seals eat penguin? ...No, no...jus' krill and fish. ...Sure of your facts are you? 
Not waiting, Mumble launches himself over the other side, slip-sliding down the mountain. One by one the ADELIES follow. 
ADELIES Well I guess we're about to find out 
THE LAND OF THE ELEPHANT SEALS 
The beach is literally heaving. 
MUMBLE and the ADELIES come tumbling and sliding right up to two HUGE SEALS. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ELEPHANT SEAL 1 (big-bellied, booming southern voice) Well roll me over and call me a dugong. What the heck have we got here 
The Adelies bunch up behind Mumble 
MUMBLE Excuse me, we need directions...to the Forbidden Shore. 
ELEPHANT SEAL 2 Sure. Just git yourselves over them there hills I'd come with you myself but... 
ELEPHANT SEAL 1 Woah Woah. You aint told em half of it: over them hills, beyond the great glacier, `n' through the blizzard country. 
The Good Ole Boys are into ONE-UPMANSHIP. 
THE ADELIES ...Oh man! This is no place for a penguin! ...We should be migrating out to sea by now! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
MUMBLE We need to huddle! 
THE ADELIES Huddle??! 
MUMBLE Form a moving circle! Share the cold, share the warmth! 
He turns his back to the wind. Immediately the Adelies form a STRAIGHT LINE down-wind from him. 
THE ADELIES ...Oh yeah, nice. ...That's definitely better. ...Good call big guy. 
MUMBLE I said a circle! 
They form a little huddle, but as soon as Mumble moves from the upwind position, the Adelies complain. 
AN ADELIE ...No, no. This can't be right! ...It was better the other way. 
They scurry back into a straight line behind Mumble who cops the FULL BLAST of the GALE. 
He gives up and marches off into the driving snow. 
THE ADELIES ...Hey! ...What happened to the Huddle?! 
MUMBLE (shouts back) Just keep moving! Toboggan, if you have to!! 
The others lie down, propelling themselves forwards on their fronts 
THE ADELIES ...Oh no, now I got chest pain ...tell you, this is a good way to get snow blind (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) THE ADELIES (CONT'D) ...just keep moving or you'll get my beak up your butt 
FLARE OUT TO WHITE 
The blizzard has passed. An eerie stillness. 
One by one the Adelies get to their feet and waddle forwards to where Mumble and Loveday stand, gazing into the distance. 
They have finally reached the sea again 
MUMBLE You think this is it? The Forbidden Shore? 
LOVEDAY chokes out a `yes'. 
ADELIES ....The way I feel": the "frostbitten" shore ....So what are those black things?. 
Close to the waters edge, the outline of several buildings 
AN ABANDONED WHALING STATION 
The PENGUINS venture through it, dwarfed by the old flensing- sheds, the chimneys and boiling-vats. Its all now abandoned, and half concealed by snow. 
Around and above them, there are HOOKS, CHAINS, rusting twisted METALWORK. 
MUMBLE Hello?! Is there anyone out there? 
An ominous GROANING as some rusting metal plate moves in the wind. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Hello!! 
THE ADELIES ...No need to shout. ...Yeah, somebody might hear you. ...I think we seen all there is to see round here. 
LOVEDAY is looking at something at his feet. 
MUMBLE swims up the side of each wave, over its foaming crest and down into the deep dark valley below. 
LATER 
The air is full of spray. Choking, MUMBLE ducks under the water. 
UNDERWATER 
Its peaceful here. Then something moves beside him and turns with a start to see: A MASSIVE EYE!! 
A BLUE WHALE entirely fills his field of vision. It sings a few booming Wagnerian notes. Its voice is almost deafening. 
MUMBLE Too loud. 
He surfaces, spluttering. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Too loud! 
A VOICE calls to him from above. Mumble looks up. An ALBATROSS hovers overhead. 
ALBATROSS He's looking for a mate, mate. And these days, I tell you they're few and far between 
From the ALBATROSS' aerial view, Mumble looks tiny next to the MASSIVE BULK of the Blue Whale. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
ALBATROSS (CONT'D) Talking of which, I never seen a penguin this far out. Watch you don't hit The Convergence mate. 
MUMBLE The Convergence? 
ALBATROSS Where the cold water meets the warm, mate. Once you cross it, there's no getting' back. What you tryinmg to prove anyway? 
MUMBLE I'm trying to talk to the Aliens! 
ALBATROSS The who? 
MUMBLE On the black iceberg. The ones taking all the fish! 
ALBATROSS Them. Fish is just the start of it Mate. Them aliens is the ones who took out the whales. 
MUMBLE They kill whales! That's impossible 
ALBATROSS Straight up mate. Biggest creatures ever lived. Decimated, mate. 
MUMBLE So if I wanted to talk to them, where would I go 
ALBATROSS Anywhere and everywhere. Over the sea, under the sea, Jees, I've even seen them fly. The great southland's swarming with em 
MUMBLE Where's that. Do you think the Whale would take me there? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
The Blue Whale responds with a long mournful "NO-O-O-O" which the Albatross does not need to translate. 
ALBATROSS No way mate, he won't go anywhere near `em. And neither should you. 
Mumble hesitates, bobbing on the water, weighing the warnings. 
He makes up his mind and strikes out again swimming towards the convergence. 
The Albatross, hovering on the wing, watches. 
ALBATROSS (CONT'D) Don't say I didn't warn you 
The ALBATROSS wheels away. 
THE TRANSPORTER BOX 
A squawking Mumble is thrust inside and the lid slams shut on him. Kerchunk. 
THE EMPEROR COLONY 
Silence, then across the vast expanse a TINY FIGURE appears on the horizon. 
PENGUIN V/O'S ...What's that? ...Where? ...Coming from the Inland! 
A couple of Penguins watch the approaching figure. 
PENGUINS ...Is it a Penguin? ...Is it one of ours? 
LATER 
Mumble approaches the two sentries. The colony is much diminished: only small groups scattered here and there. 
MUMBLE Hi, where is everybody!? 
PENGUINS Who wants to know? 
MUMBLE I used to live here. When's the Great Gathering? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
PENGUINS This is it. I guess 
MUMBLE This is all that's left? 
Other penguins are gathering to scrutinise the stranger. 
PENGUINS ... So Who's this? ...Kinda small for an emperor. ...(suspicious) Where did you say you were from? 
Then a female penguin bursts out of the crowd. 
ELLA Mumble?! Its Mumble!! 
MUMBLE Ella! Is it you. You haven't changed a bit. 
As he speaks, his eyes are drawn to the huge number of FLUFFY CHICKS following behind her 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Are these all yours? 
ELLA They're my singing students. 
MUMBLE So. You never.... 
ELLA Of course not. I was waiting for you. 
MUMBLE But that's fantastic. I've got so much to tell you - to tell everyone. (To the gathering crowd) I found out who's been causing the Scarcity! 
ELLA Huh? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) 
MUMBLE I know who's been taking our fish! I made contact with Aliens! They're coming here. Right behind me. Listen. 
They listen. Above the wind   faint electronic BEEPING SOUND. 
PENGUINS ...Who's doing all the shouting ...Its Mumble. He's worse than before. 
MUMBLE No, honestly Aliens will be here soon! You have to believe me. We came in a big hollow bird and they landed on the ice and.... 
CARUSO bursts through the crowd. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) That's it! Excellent! ¡Riba Riba, penguinos! Shake those hips. Come on, bust a move!! 
CARUSO. Adhere to the wisdoms!! The Ancients will protect us 
As he shouts his he is blown off his feet by a tremendous gust of wind 
Caruso tumbles head over heels as a massive Chinook helicopter rises over the hirizon, its massive rotors mashing the air. 
It swoops down over the penguin nation and lands a little distance away. 
Music Over: Wanna Dance with Somebody. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (5) 
Now the entire emperor community are dancing for all they are worth. 
PENGUINS ....Aliens. ... I never doubted it for a moment 
Mrs Astrakhan dances past 
MRS ASTRAKHAN More feelink. BE SPONTANUOUS!! 
Wishful dances over to her, his eyes on Mumble and Ella 
WISHFUL (dancing) You know who that is? That's my boy! 
MRS ASTRAKHAN (dancing) Know him? He ees my star pupol! I TEACH HIM EVERYTHINGK! 
BY THE CHINOOK 
HUMAN scientists disembark. Skidoos are kicked into life. 
We TRAVEL WITH THE SKIDOOS across the ICE-SHELF to the colony 
Scientists POV: As they stop, lower their hoods and gaze in astonishment. One of them lifts a video cam to record 
THOUSANDS OF EMPEROR PENGUIN DANCING WITH PURE, ABANDONED JOY. 
MUMBLE (VO) From that day on, No one quite knows how it happened, but the black icebergs began to disappear and the fish became abundant once more. 
A CONFERENCE ROOM 
Suited figures are seated round a large table, watching as IMAGES of the DANCING PENGUIN COLONY play on a video screen. 
Without the music it's less obviously a dance. 
CHAIRMAN ...So what do you reckon? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
EXPERT Yes, quite extraordinary. (stares at the screen) some kind of neurological disorder? a nutritional deficiency perhaps. We'd certainly back the long-term study. 
CHAIRMAN And the international treaty? 
DELEGATE#1 Yes. This is exactly the leverage we need for an embargo. No fishing whatsoever...legal, illegal, sanctioned, whatever. 
DELEGATE#2 So we all step up policing of the pirate factory ships. And we pressure that country to stop their so-called `experimental' fishing. 
DELEGATE#3 Yes, if our government asks your government to approach their government to call off their fleet... 
DELEGATE#2 Better if their government hear it from our government via your government... 
CHAIRMAN What the heck. The amount of publicity this is generating, they'd have world war three if they didn't stop. 
THE COLONY

INT. MASTER BATHROOM - DAY 
PETE (39) and DEBBIE (39) are having fantastic sex in the shower. Debbie moans loudly. Pete is strong and sure of himself. In total control. 
DEBBIE Oh Pete! Oh my god! This is crazy! 
PETE Oh my god. So incredible. Want to know a secret? I took a Viagra. 
DEBBIE What? 
PETE I took a Viagra. Those things totally work. This is awesome. Why don't I use this every day? 
DEBBIE What? What did you do? Wait. Stop. 
Debbie gets out of the shower. Pete follows. 
PETE What's the matter? 
DEBBIE You just took a Viagra to have sex with me? 
PETE I thought it would make it better. It was better. It takes some of the pressure off. 
DEBBIE Because you can't get hard without a Viagra? Is it because you don't think I'm sexy? 
PETE I thought you'd think it was fun for me to supersize it for once. 
DEBBIE That is the worst birthday present you could ever give someone. 
PETE I was just trying to go turbo for your birthday. (MORE) 
PETE (CONT'D) My hard-ons are still in analog. This shit's digital. 
DEBBIE I don't want a turbo penis. I like your medium soft one. 
PETE Look, I can get it up. Just not that far up. 
DEBBIE Where did you get this? 
PETE I got it from Barry. 
DEBBIE What? You got it from Barry? 
PETE Why do you care? This is my dick we're talking about, not yours. 
DEBBIE We are young people. We don't need medication to have sex. 
PETE I only took it because it's your birthday. I thought you'd like it. Happy fucking fortieth birthday. 
DEBBIE I am not forty! And I don't want to have a husband who has to take Viagra to get a hard-on. 
PETE I don't have to take it every time, but once in a while... 
DEBBIE Fuck forty! Forty can suck my dick. 
TITLE UP - THIS IS 40 
INT. HALLWAY/SADIE'S ROOM - MORNING 
Pete sneaks down the hallway. He kisses SADIE (13) as he wakes her. She wants to be left alone. 
SADIE Your breath smells weird. 
Pete breathes all over her as he talks. 
PETE Wake up, wake up. Time to get up. 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - MORNING 
Pete lifts a sleeping CHARLOTTE (8) out of bed and walks her downstairs. It looks ridiculous because she is too tall to hold her like she is a baby. 
INT. BREAKFAST NOOK - MORNING 
Pete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the table and decorate the room with birthday balloons, streamers, etc. Pete sneaks bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts into his mouth occasionally. The house is a bit more cluttered and messier than when we last saw it in Knocked Up. 
INT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING 
Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette. 
PETE (O.C.) We're ready! 
She holds her cigarette with a yellow dish washing glove. She puts out the cigarette and goes through an elaborate routine of hiding the smell of smoke. She puts some weird oil in her hair and uses a wet nap on her neck and clothes and brushes her teeth. She sprays cologne and walks through it. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Pete and the kids hold a cake and sing "Happy Birthday" as Debbie walks in. When they are done she blows out the candles on the cake which says "Happy 38th Birthday." 
PETE Make a wish! 
INT. KITCHEN, TV AREA - MORNING 
The kids eat cereal. Sadie watches Lost on her iPad while Pete and Debbie talk in the kitchen. 
CHARLOTTE Can I watch Lost? 
SADIE You can't handle Lost. It's too violent, and you won't understand. 
CHARLOTTE If I don't understand it, why can't I handle it? 
SADIE Because you're eight. 
We see Pete in a large group of bikers riding down San Vicente. Pete's friend BARRY is part of the group. 
BARRY Hey, thanks for letting me join this team. 
PETE It's not really a team, it's just a bunch of guys who get together and ride. 
BARRY I know, I know. 
A car makes a right turn in front of Pete, nearly hitting him. Pete bangs on the back of the car. 
PETE Bike lane, asshole! It's always the guy in the fucking Infiniti. 
EXT. STREETS NEAR THE STAIRS - DAY 
Debbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her feet down. In the background, Barb stretches on a yoga ball. 
JASON So why on earth is Pete taking Viagra? What's going on? 
DEBBIE I don't know. I think maybe he just isn't attracted to me anymore. 
JASON That is ridiculous. If you were my girlfriend, I would not need a Viagra. I would need an anti-Viagra pill. To try not to get a boner. 
DEBBIE But everyone gives you a boner. 
JASON Don't sell yourself short like that. You give me a boner. (whispers) Barb doesn't give me a boner. 
DEBBIE Maybe things are just getting stale. That's why maybe I work out really hard. Maybe he'll be able to get a boner again. 
BARB Why do you need to have sex, Deb? Sex is the number one thing people fight about. (MORE) 
BARB (CONT'D) You stop having sex, there will be no more fights. I am living proof. I have no sex, and I am the happiest I've ever been. 
JASON I knew it. I knew you were not having sex. I can see it on your face. It's all puckered and pained. 
BARB I'm enjoying our non-sex period, that's all I'm saying. 
JASON Don't you miss it? 
BARB Well, I wouldn't know, because I don't have any feeling down there anymore. I have nerve damage from my C-section so everything is just kinda- 
DEBBIE She's numb down there. 
BARB I could sit down hard on a fire hydrant, and I wouldn't even know that I was sitting. I could get stung by a hornet down there, and I would not feel it. You could put anything in there, and I would not know what the object was. I used to pee in a nice stream, and now it just kind of goes like a shower head. 
JASON That is the saddest thing I've ever heard. 
DEBBIE I think you need a family. Don't you want a family? 
JASON No, I think I want to Clooney it. 
DEBBIE Clooney it? 
JASON Yup. 
DEBBIE He doesn't seem happy. 
JASON Yeah, he is. 
DEBBIE No. He's lonely. 
JASON No, he's not. 
DEBBIE See, I think he has sad eyes. 
JASON Aw, you sweet little thing. He's doing sad, lonely eyes. To get the next lady. I can do it too, watch. 
Jason demonstrates. 
DEBBIE I bet George Clooney is really lonely. Just him and his pig. 
JASON You'd fuck him. 
DEBBIE I wouldn't. 
JASON So would you. 
BARB I would. I wouldn't feel it but- 
JASON You'd fuck him with your numb vagina. Yes, you would. Ocean's thirteen inches, that's what you'd find out. 
DEBBIE Do you think? 
INT. STARBUCKS - MOMENTS LATER 
Pete and Barry eat frosted scones, happy to get some alone time to delay their return home. 
BARRY I mean that was idiotic. You have to understand. That's like the one thing you don't do is tell her you used Viagra. I think that's even on the warning label. 
PETE We're in one of those phases where everything the other person says just annoys the shit out of each other. All the time. It's a blast. 
BARRY Don't worry about it. You just gotta ride that out. 
PETE This sounds terrible but do you ever wonder what it would be like if, say, you were separated by something bigger, like death. Like her death? 
BARRY I have given it a fair amount of thought. 
PETE Not in a painful way. Just quietly slid into death. Like a gas leak. 
BARRY Absolutely. It has got to be peaceful. I mean this is the mother of your children. 
PETE I'd want it to be a peaceful -- just like, drift, into a coma, from which she never awakens. 
BARRY Then you move on. Then you're a widower. 
PETE That's just it. People love widowers. 
PETE It's all dark up there. 
DEBBIE What? Why are you looking? 
PETE I didn't mean to look, I just said, `Hey- woah!' There it was. 
DEBBIE Maybe she's wearing dark underwear. 
PETE Yeah. Maybe she has underwear that has a picture of a vagina painted on it. 
DEBBIE Stop looking. 
Desi comes down to help a CUSTOMER at the front of the store. 
DESI Maybe some deep oranges and browns and maybe dark greens? That would really play up your features. 
CUSTOMER I'll just take out my AmEx and you pick what stuff you think is good. 
EXT. BACKYARD - DAY 
We see quick cuts of Debbie playing with the kids on the trampoline outside. She does a full flip and lands on her feet. Pete is nowhere to be found. 
DEBBIE Woo! Where's daddy? 
SADIE I think he went to poop. 
DEBBIE Pete! 
INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Debbie walks down the hall and into the bathroom without knocking. Pete is on the toilet playing Scrabble on his iPad. 
DEBBIE What are you doing? 
PETE Going to the bathroom. 
DEBBIE We're all downstairs waiting for you. You've been up here for a really long time now. 
PETE Oh, I'm almost done. I'll be down in a second. 
DEBBIE Charlotte just did her first flip on the trampoline, and she landed on her feet. She was really proud of herself. 
PETE Oh, that's great. 
DEBBIE And you missed it. 
PETE She'll do it again. 
DEBBIE It's just that this is the fourth time you've gone to the bathroom today. 
PETE Give me a break. 
DEBBIE Why is your instinct to escape? 
PETE It's not my instinct to escape from you. It is my instinct to come into the bathroom when I need to go to the bathroom. 
DEBBIE How come I don't smell anything? 
PETE It's because I shoved an Altoid up my ass before I came in here. 
DEBBIE Let me see then. 
PETE What? 
DEBBIE Let me see! 
PETE No, I'm not going to let you see. 
DEBBIE You're not going to let me see because you're not taking a poop. 
PETE I've been flushing as I go. 
DEBBIE You're flushing as you go? Who takes a half hour to go to the bathroom? 
PETE (thinks for a second) John Goodman. 
She angrily grabs his iPad and walks out. 
PETE (CONT'D) Don't press Enter! I'm not sure I want to make that move! 
EXT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT 
A sign outside reads: "Tonight Only: Graham Parker" 
INT. SMALL NIGHTCLUB - STAGE - NIGHT 
Pete stands on stage speaking to a small crowd. 
PETE You know, when I started this label, my dream was to work with musicians and bands whose music I just admired so much. The person that I thought, "My god, wouldn't it be incredible to work with" was Graham Parker. Tonight we have him. Solo. Because we couldn't afford to fly in The Rumour. 
The crowd applauds as Graham Parker (60's) leaps on stage. 
Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song. The song is fantastic and personal, but clearly not commercial. 
We watch Debbie. Although the music is great, it's a little depressing and not working on her. She quickly gets bored. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Pete and Debbie are driving home. 
DEBBIE It's just not my kind of music. 
PETE Really. What is your kind of music? 
DEBBIE I like Lady Gaga. 
PETE So, you're saying that if we're arguing and I apologize, you'll let it go and not throw it back in my face later? 
DEBBIE Well, I don't do that, but I will continue not to do that. What did you write? 
PETE All of that. That's plenty. That's a lot. 
DEBBIE And you're going to eat better? 
PETE Oh, yeah. I've been doing a decent job, but I don't think there's anything wrong with having some fries every now and again. 
DEBBIE And then I'll smoke that day. 
PETE That's not the same thing. 
DEBBIE It is the same thing. 
PETE I like fries. 
DEBBIE And the other thing is your dad stuff. 
Pete picks up a guitar and starts playing with it. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) The not letting him guilt trip you all the time, because that puts a lot of pressure on you, and the whole family feels it. He's a grown man, and he's not our responsibility. And you're not giving him money anymore, right? 
PETE No, I haven't been giving him money for years, I told you. 
DEBBIE Can you please put that down? 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Pete and Debbie are in bed. Debbie has a computer on her lap. 
DEBBIE A lot of people are RSVP-ing to your birthday party. 
PETE You sure you don't want to just do a joint birthday party? 
DEBBIE No. 
PETE We always used to. 
DEBBIE No. 
We reveal that Debbie is watching security cam footage of the store. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Did Jodi tell you she thinks Desi's stealing? 
PETE Are you serious? 
DEBBIE Yes. 
PETE How much? 
DEBBIE Twelve thousand dollars. 
PETE Oh, god. And Desi's taking it? 
DEBBIE Well, I don't know. That's what Jodi said. 
PETE We really need the store to work. 
DEBBIE It is. Don't put that kind of pressure on me. 
PETE That's not what I mean. 
DEBBIE Are you nervous about money? Are we okay? 
PETE Yeah. Maybe we just suck it up because she's clearly earning so much more than any other employee we have. 
DEBBIE Oh, yeah. For sure. We can't fire her. We're barely breaking even with her. 
PETE That's why we have to keep her. 
We watch the footage and suddenly Desi's BOYFRIEND enters. He walks behind the counter, and she sits on his lap. She adjusts herself. 
DEBBIE Look at this, she's making out with somebody. 
On the screen, they kiss. Desi seems to be popping up and down a little. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Is she screwing him?? 
PETE That might be like a dry hump. 
DEBBIE Look at the position of her skirt. 
PETE That's too grainy to know for sure. Oh my god, this is the middle of the day. Customers could be in there. 
DEBBIE At least she's getting some. 
PETE What did you say? "At least she's getting some"? 
DEBBIE Yes. 
PETE What are you talking about? We had sex the other night. You have to give me a little credit for that. 
DEBBIE It's not about credit. We need to have more passion. Like this. 
PETE That's not passion. 
DEBBIE It looks like passion to me. 
PETE What-- 
Pete farts. 
PETE (CONT'D) What is she doing? 
DEBBIE I don't know. 
DR. PELLIGRINO Do you have a tree and everything? 
DEBBIE Yes. 
DR. PELLIGRINO Isn't that fun. Get in the spirit-- 
Two nurses enter the exam room. 
NURSE #1 Hi, sorry I just have one quick question. On your form you said you were born in 1974, but your paper said 1972. I just need to know which it is. 
DEBBIE Oh. It's 1974. 
NURSE #2 Because on your last form you said that you were born in 1975. 
DR. PELLIGRINO Didn't you tell me you were born in 
DEBBIE No. That's funny. 
NURSE #2 So you want to go with 1974? 
DEBBIE I'm not going to "go" with 1974, it is 1974. 
NURSE #2 Okay. Just remember to write 1974 every time. 
DR. PELLIGRINO It's okay. It's 1976. 
DEBBIE I lie about my age, okay? 
DR. PELLIGRINO Okay. 
DEBBIE Okay? Okay? Okay?! 
DR. PELLIGRINO You're tightening up. 
DEBBIE Oh my gosh. 
DR. PELLIGRINO I know how old you are. By counting the rings! Little gyno joke. 
INT. BEDROOM - LATER 
Debbie comes in the bedroom. 
DEBBIE What are you doing? 
PETE Getting ready to go for my ride. 
DEBBIE You want a blow job? 
PETE Yeah. Why? 
DEBBIE I really want a cigarette right now. 
PETE Well, happy to help. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Sadie runs down the hallway. 
SADIE Charlotte, where is my backpack? 
INT. OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Charlotte tries to open the door, it's locked. 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Debbie is giving Pete a blow job out of frame. Pete is sitting on a chair, super happy. 
CHARLOTTE (O.C.) Hello? 
PETE Mom's busy! 
CHARLOTTE (O.C.) Why are you locking the door? Mom! 
INT. OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
CHARLOTTE What's going on in there? 
SADIE Mom, I can't be late for school, I have a test! 
PETE (O.C.) Mommy can't talk right now! 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
SADIE (O.C.) This isn't funny, Mom. I need to go. 
CHARLOTTE (O.C.) Mom, let me in! 
INT. OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
SADIE That's not going to help. 
Charlotte shoves Sadie. 
PETE (O.C.) Put on your shoes. We'll meet you in the car. 
The fight between Sadie and Charlotte escalates and becomes physical. 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
CHARLOTTE (O.C.) Sadie hurt me! 
SADIE (O.C.) I didn't! 
LARRY Claire takes care of your brothers. What do you want her to do? If she goes to work, then I've got to hire somebody. 
PETE Well you've got to figure something out because I can't do it. 
LARRY Okay, fine. Why don't we kill them? Come on, we'll kill two of them. I'll keep the best one. Really, it will save us both a lot of trouble. 
Larry stands up and walks outside. Pete follows. 
EXT. LARRY'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Larry prepares to spray the kids with the hose. 
LARRY Line up! Line up for murder! Come on! Who wants to be killed? 
TRIPLET #1 I do! 
LARRY Okay, we're eliminating one, we're cheaper already. 
Larry sprays him with the hose. 
TRIPLET #2 Murder me! 
LARRY Boom, dead. You're dead. 
TRIPLET #2 I'm dead! 
LARRY All right, the kids are murdered. That will save us some money. 
PETE Why would you have three kids, anyway? I mean, you're sixty years old. You have no money. 
LARRY Because Claire wanted a baby. If we didn't at least try, she would have left me. She was forty-five years old. Nobody thought it would take. (MORE) 
LARRY (CONT'D) The doctor when we were doing in vitro was winking at me like, "Don't worry, don't worry." We were very unlucky. And now we have these three beautiful children... Come on, I've got to tell you something. 
INT. LARRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
PETE What? 
LARRY Your mother wanted you aborted. 
PETE Oh, Jesus Christ. 
LARRY It's the truth. It was the seventies. We were twenty-two years old. That's what everybody did. You did some blow, had sex, had an abortion. 
PETE Really. 
LARRY Yes. We were on the way to the doctor's office. I said, "Let's stop, have a pizza, talk about it, if you still want to do it after lunch, it's okay." The pizza saved your life. But don't give me money. Because I'm not worth it. 
PETE So how much do I owe you for saving my life? 
LARRY I don't have a number. You just keep giving like you're giving. 
Larry's wife, CLAIRE, enters. 
CLAIRE Oh, hi Pete. (to Larry) Why aren't you playing with kids? 
LARRY We were playing with them all day. Pete's just talking to me about his fortieth birthday party... Whatever I can do to help. 
CLAIRE Okay. Did you feed them? 
LARRY I fed half of one. Okay, let's feed them. Who wants tuna with a side of jet fuel? 
Larry gets up and walks outside. 
INT. RESTAURANT - DAY 
A nervous Debbie approaches a hostess. 
DEBBIE Hi, I'm looking for my dad, an older man? 
Debbie sees OLIVER (65) sitting stiffly at a table. 
INT. RESTAURANT - LATER 
OLIVER So how's Sony treating Pete? 
DEBBIE Oh, he's not with Sony anymore. He went out on his own. Now he's able to focus on the artists that he's really passionate about. 
OLIVER How's Sadie doing? Last time I saw her she was throwing her Cheerios on the floor. What a mess. 
DEBBIE She just got her period. 
OLIVER Well. I guess she's not a little baby anymore. 
DEBBIE It would be nice to see more of each other. 
OLIVER Well, we can certainly arrange for that. I'd love to see the girls. 
DEBBIE That would be nice. Do you have a good day? 
OLIVER I would say the weekends, but our weekends are hell. Soccer competitions, kids exams. I mean, we're both so busy. I have young children, you have young children. I don't think we should judge ourselves too harshly about that. 
DEBBIE I know, I wasn't. I'm glad we're here. I think this is a good start and that if we can spend more time together, it would be nice. 
OLIVER It would be nice. (pause) Do you want to see pictures of the kids? 
Oliver takes out his iPhone and starts showing Debbie photos. 
OLIVER (CONT'D) This is Kell, my son. 
DEBBIE He's handsome. He's thirteen? 
OLIVER Yeah. And that's Alexandra, my daughter, she's a real perfectionist. A lot like you. That's the whole gang at Cabo. (pause) Will you excuse me, dear? I've got to use the restroom. Be right back. 
He exits. Debbie picks up his iPhone and sadly scrolls through all the happy pictures of his new family. 
Pete and Debbie drive down the Pacific Coast Highway. 
DEBBIE This is the best birthday present. 
PETE It's good to get away, you know? We haven't been to Laguna without the kids in years. 
INT. PETE AND DEBBIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
DEBBIE I know! 
PETE If we're happy, they're happy. 
DEBBIE I mean I can't take it. With the hormones, and the crying, and "do my homework"... 
PETE Them's little bitches. 
DEBBIE Them's lil' bitches! Bugging us for shit all the time. And they never appreciate anything. 
PETE God no. They're selfish assholes. 
DEBBIE (laughs) Aw, I feel bad. I love them. 
PETE I know. 
EXT. LAGUNA HOTEL - CONTINUOUS 
The car pulls up to a beautiful hotel in Laguna. 
DEBBIE I miss them already. Should we go home? 
PETE Nah. 
LAGUNA HOTEL - MONTAGE 
Pete and Debbie hold hands as they walk the hotel grounds. 
They enter their room, which has a beautiful ocean view. Debbie jumps on the bed. Pete jumps on top to kiss her. 
Pete and Debbie jump into the hotel pool together. 
Pete holds Debbie in the water. They kiss. 
INT. LAGUNA HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Pete and Debbie are in bed in their underwear. 
DEBBIE Why do we fight? 
PETE I don't know, it makes no sense at all. 
DEBBIE It makes no sense. 
PETE When we get in a fight, look in my eyes. Let's remember this moment right now and know that we never have to fight. 
DEBBIE But you're such a dick sometimes. 
PETE I know, I am a dick sometimes. People think I'm so nice, but I'm such a dick. 
DEBBIE Thank you for admitting that. 
PETE And you get so mad at me. I feel like you want to kill me. 
DEBBIE I do want to kill you. 
PETE How would you do it? 
DEBBIE I don't know... poison you. I'd poison your cupcakes that you pretend not to eat everyday. And just put enough in to slowly weaken you. 
PETE I love it. 
DEBBIE I would enjoy our last few months together. 
PETE Me too. 
DEBBIE Because you'd be so weak and sweet, and I could take care of you but while killing you. 
PETE See? You know what I love about us? You can still surprise me. I figured for sure you'd knock me out with one fell swoop. But you would extend it over a series of months. 
DEBBIE Have you ever thought about killing me? 
PETE Oh, yeah. 
DEBBIE Really? 
PETE Sure. 
DEBBIE How would you do it? 
PETE Wood chipper. 
DEBBIE A wood chipper? 
PETE Did you see Fargo? 
DEBBIE Yeah. 
Pete makes a wood chipping splatter noise. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Wow. That's a bad plan. The cupcakes is a way better plan. 
PETE It is. You know what? I won't murder you. 
DEBBIE Aw. I love you. 
PETE I love you too... Hey. You know what I brought? 
Pete and Debbie drive back from Laguna. They could not look happier or more refreshed. They hold hands and smile at each other. It is a beautiful day. 
They pull up to their house, shut off the car and sit for a beat, knowing they're about to head back into the stress of the real world, not wanting their peaceful, loving time to end. 
PETE That was nice. 
DEBBIE That was nice. 
Sadie walks outside. Jodi follows her. 
SADIE Mom! Charlotte's crying. She's got an ear infection again. 
JODI I didn't know what to do. 
PETE (to Debbie) We're home. 
INT. CHARLOTTE'S ROOM - DAY 
Charlotte is crying really hard. 
DEBBIE Are you okay? What's the matter? 
CHARLOTTE I just want to rip my ear off, it hurts so much. 
DEBBIE (to Pete) I told you the pediatrician didn't know what he was talking about. 
PETE Oh, come on. You can't blame it on our doctor. Ear infections are common in little kids. 
DEBBIE Not in kids over six years old. We're going to the Eastern doctor. 
PETE If she's in this much pain, we should call a real doctor. 
DEBBIE Are you kidding right now? 
PETE Okay. 
INT. DOCTOR SEDUKU - DAY 
Charlotte sits on the table. Pete and Debbie are talking to DR. SEDUKU, a foreign doctor. 
DOCTOR SEDUKU What we should do is easy and simple. No more dairy, no more wheat, no more sugar. 
DEBBIE Sugar, wheat and dairy. Okay. 
PETE (mutters) What the fuck is left? Sorry. Isn't everything sugar, wheat and dairy? 
DOCTOR SEDUKU She can have vegetables and f-r-ruits. 
Dr. Seduku has both an accent and a lisp. 
PETE Oh, she can eat fr-r-ruits. 
DOCTOR SEDUKU Fr-r-ruits, yes. 
PETE Any kind of fr-r-ruits? 
DOCTOR SEDUKU Mangos, pineapple... 
PETE It isn't like there are safe fr-r- ruits and then unsafe fr-r-ruits. 
DOCTOR SEDUKU No, no. 
PETE What about F-r-r-rench f-r-r-ries? Can we do something like that? 
DOCTOR SEDUKU Are you okay? Would you like to come on the table? 
PETE I'm okay. 
DEBBIE Why don't you go on the table? 
PETE No. 
DEBBIE Why don't you go on the table? It looks like you need to get on the table. 
PETE I don't want to get on the table. 
EXT. BRENTWOOD - DAY 
Pete cycles with the crew. 
INT. HOUSE - DAY - LATER 
Debbie looks around the house for Pete. 
DEBBIE Pete! 
INT. BEDROOM - DAY 
Debbie sees Pete on the bed, his legs up in the air. He still has his bike top on but is naked from the waist down. 
He is trying to look at his back end. He is holding a mirror and an iPhone. 
DEBBIE What are you doing? 
PETE I need you to look at something. In my butt. 
DEBBIE Why? 
PETE I think I've got something in there, and I'm not limber enough to see. I need you to look at it. I might have like an anal fissure or a hemorrhoid or a worm or something. 
DEBBIE What are you doing with your phone? 
PETE Trying to take pictures of it, so I can compare it to something on Google. 
DEBBIE Can we just keep like a small shred of mystery in our relationship? 
Larry and Debbie greet the kids when they enter the kitchen. Larry picks up one of the triplets. 
LARRY Did you miss me Travis? 
TRIPLET #1 It's Jack! 
LARRY Hey, Jack. 
TRIPLET #1 My daddy doesn't know my name. 
CHARLOTTE Can I go show them my crystals before they leave? 
DEBBIE Yeah, really quick. 
Charlotte leaves with the triplets. 
LARRY Go play with your tiny uncles. (to Debbie) So, what are you doing, spring cleaning? 
DEBBIE I'm getting rid of everything in the house that has gluten or sugar. 
LARRY Why? What's wrong with gluten? 
DEBBIE Gluten's really bad for you. 
LARRY I don't think so. It's wheat. 
DEBBIE Don't you watch Dr. Oz? 
LARRY As in the Wizard of? 
SADIE Hey, Mom. We were wondering if we could use the computer to iChat. 
DEBBIE Remember the rules? Eight to eight- thirty? 
SADIE Yeah, but I have a friend over. 
DEBBIE Hi Wendy. Why don't you guys go play? You could go build a fort! 
LARRY Remember the Alamo? 
DEBBIE Have you ever built a fort, Wendy? 
WENDY Like on Facebook? 
LARRY I will take this if you're going to throw it away, because at our house, we're wheat eaters. 
DEBBIE But don't you want to live long enough to see your kids grow up? 
LARRY That's up to god, honey. 
DEBBIE But that's really not good for the kids. 
LARRY The kids eat grass. This is fine. 
Larry takes some of the food she's throwing out. 
SADIE Wendy's mom lets her go on whenever she wants. 
WENDY My mom's pretty cool about it as long as I finish my homework. 
DEBBIE Yeah. Well, I guess I'm not the cool one. But the rules are just different in our house. 
SADIE But I get better grades than Wendy. 
WENDY She does. She's so smart. 
LARRY Let me just grab the candy worms. 
SADIE Your rules are ridiculous. 
DEBBIE Don't sass me. 
SADIE I'm only sassing you because you're throwing out all the food in our house and I'm freaking starving. You're being stupid. 
DEBBIE Wendy, can you go stand in the other room, please? 
WENDY Yeah. 
Wendy exits. 
SADIE (whispers) Mom. 
DEBBIE Give me your iPhone now. 
LARRY The nougat things are good. 
SADIE I have all my contacts in there. 
DEBBIE Okay, if you don't give me your phone right now, then I'm going to have to take away your phone and your computer. 
SADIE Jesus Christ-- 
DEBBIE That's it. 
SADIE I need my computer to do homework. 
DEBBIE No phone, no computer. 
SADIE This is B.S. This is a bunch of F- ing S. You're acting like a B. 
LARRY Kids! Time to go! 
DEBBIE You go to your room right now. 
Sadie runs off. 
JOSEPH Sadie...? 
DEBBIE Sadie, the one you chat with on the internet? 
JOSEPH Nah, man. That ain't me. 
DEBBIE Well, it was you, I saw your picture. Did you make a "Hot" list and not put Sadie on the "Hot" list? 
JOSEPH She was not on my list, no. 
DEBBIE You know what I'm going to do? I'm going to make my own "Hot" list, and you know what? You're on the "Not Hot" list. How does that feel? 
JOSEPH It doesn't bother me. I'm comfortable with the way I am. 
She gets even quieter, scarier and more in his face. 
DEBBIE Maybe you shouldn't be so comfortable with yourself. You know why? You look like a miniature Tom Petty. How's that feel? Huh? You think that haircut's cool? It's not. It looks like you put your Justin Bieber wig on backwards. You still comfortable with yourself? Why are you wearing a tank top? Huh? So you can show off your bald pits, you little hairless wonder? Cool tank top, man. So next time you think about writing something nasty on my daughter's Facebook page, just remember me. Remember me. I will come down here, and I will fuck you up. 
Joseph looks upset. 
JOSEPH Okay, I'm sorry. 
DEBBIE Wait a minute. Hey. Are you crying? 
JOSEPH Just let me go. 
DEBBIE I'm sorry. I'm not in my right head. 
JOSEPH I understand. My mom is going through menopause, too. It's a hard time. 
DEBBIE What did you say? 
JOSEPH You're going through menopause? 
DEBBIE I'm not going through menopause! I'm not going to go through menopause for twenty years. I'm pregnant you little bitch. God damn it! 
She storms off. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Debbie pulls open the door, Pete is on the toilet playing on his iPad. 
DEBBIE I'm going out to coffee with Desi to find out if she's stealing from us. 
PETE I've got the Graham Parker concert. Who's gonna watch the kids? 
DEBBIE I don't know. Figure it out. 
Debbie exits. Pete flips her off after she's gone. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Debbie and Desi are talking as they walk down the stairs into a loud club. 
DEBBIE I just wanted to talk. Maybe we could go to a coffee house or something?

INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Debbie and Desi talk to a group of young men, PROFESSIONAL HOCKEY PLAYERS. 
DESI What sport do you guys play? 
HOCKEY PLAYER We play hockey. 
DESI Oh, I like hockey. 
DEBBIE Who do you guys play for? 
HOCKEY PLAYER We play for the Philadelphia Flyers. 
DEBBIE You guys are all from Philadelphia? 
HOCKEY PLAYER No, actually none of us are. 
DESI Do you guys still have all of your teeth? 
HOCKEY PLAYER #2 Well, I've got all my teeth, except for these ones. 
He takes a plate of his teeth out. 
HOCKEY PLAYER #2 (CONT'D) Want to try them on? 
Desi takes them and tries to put them in her mouth. Everyone laughs. 
DESI Do I look sexy? 
Desi looks insane. She tries to kiss Debbie. Everyone is laughing. 
HOCKEY PLAYER #3 They definitely look way better on her than they do on you. 
She hands the teeth back to their owner. He pops them back in and everyone cheers. 
DEBBIE So, should we go to the quiet area? 
HOCKEY PLAYERS No, no. 
HOCKEY PLAYER #4 Where are you going? 
DEBBIE We kind of have to have a little business meeting tonight. 
HOCKEY PLAYER Business meeting? You have to celebrate with us. We won tonight. 
DESI I want to party with these winners, come on Deb. 
Billie Joe comes over to congratulate Graham. 
BILLIE JOE Graham, hey, what's up? 
GRAHAM Billie! 
BILLIE JOE How you doing, man? Great show. I'm inspired. I want to write a song right now. 
GRAHAM Inspired, huh? That inspires me. 
BILLIE JOE Let's go get a drink. 
GRAHAM Let's get a drink. 
BILLIE JOE (to Pete) You coming? 
PETE No. I'm fine. You guys go. Congratulations on Glee. 
They walk away. 
BILLIE JOE You got a song on Glee? That's killer, man. That's so much money, that's good for all of us. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Pete sits in the car crying. 
INT. CAR - NIGHT 
Debbie is dropping Desi off at her apartment. 
DEBBIE Why did you put that guy's teeth in your mouth? That's so gross. He was dirty. 
DESI No, he was wearing a tie. 
DEBBIE That's true. 
DESI When I kissed him, I felt his little tiny teeth nubs with my tongue. 
DEBBIE You did? 
DESI It was like kissing a baby. French kissing a baby. 
DEBBIE Can I ask you something stupid? Do you know why we're missing money at the store? 
DESI Are you guys missing money? 
DEBBIE Like twelve thousand dollars. 
DESI Wait. Do you think I took it? 
DEBBIE Well, no. I did, but now I don't. 
DESI It's not me. 
DEBBIE Then, why do you live in such a nice apartment and have such a fancy car? 
DESI Yes, you're right. Look. I... am an escort. I get paid to go out on dates. 
Debbie looks shocked. 
DESI (CONT'D) But only three to five times a year. Ten times max. But it's not technically "prostitution" because I don't have to sleep with them. 
DEBBIE Well, that's good. 
DESI But I always do. That's why I only do it four to eight times a year, fifteen times max. 
DEBBIE Huh. 
DESI One year I did it twenty. 
DEBBIE As long as you think it's safe. 
DESI It's safe. I only do it ten to thirty times a year. 
DEBBIE So, who do you think is stealing money? 
DESI It's Jodi. 
DEBBIE No. 
DESI Yeah. She's a pilled-out whore. 
DEBBIE Since you told me, I want to tell you something. 
DESI You're pregnant. 
DEBBIE How did you know? 
Desi nods. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Wow. Maybe you should tell Pete. 
DESI You didn't tell Pete yet? Why not? 
DEBBIE I don't know. I just want him to want me. I don't want him to want me because I'm pregnant. 
DESI Go home and suck his dick and tell him then and he will love it. 
DEBBIE You think? 
DESI He'll be so excited. Or even better yet, you should tell him while you're sucking his dick. (mimes a blow job) "I'm pregnant." 
INT. BEDROOM - NEXT MORNING 
Pete on his iPad laying in bed. Debbie comes in to talk. 
PETE Simon controls him. 
DEBBIE That's because Simon writes the fucking songs! He's the better one. 
PETE You know what? I see the way you look at our kids. You have so much love and compassion for them. You never look at me like that. Ever. 
DEBBIE Would we even still be together if I didn't get pregnant fourteen years ago? 
PETE I'm not going to go down that road. 
DEBBIE Would we? 
Pete doesn't say anything. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Okay. 
Debbie starts walking away. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) You know what? I don't even want to have a party here. You need to cancel it. 
PETE No, I'm not. I already paid for the catering, I put down deposits, and I`m not going to call everybody back in two days when change your mind. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
They all are laying in bed watching Spongebob Squarepants. It is tense. Charlotte is licking her fingers. 
SADIE Can you please stop licking your fingers? 
Charlotte does it more. 
SADIE (CONT'D) Do you know how many germs are on your hands? And you're putting them into your mouth. It's gross. Stop. 
Charlotte pokes Sadie with her wet fingers. 
SADIE (CONT'D) I'm going to kill you! 
PETE Hey! Sadie, enough! She isn't hurting anyone. If you want to say something, keep your mouth shut. 
DEBBIE You have never been nice to her and now she's getting aggressive with you. I told you this would happen. 
Sadie leaves and slams her door. 
CHARLOTTE I'm sick of everybody fighting. 
Charlotte leaves.

CHARLOTTE I don't know. 
DEBBIE Do you think you want kids? 
CHARLOTTE Just one. 
DEBBIE Just one? Why? 
CHARLOTTE Because if I have two then the one will fight with the other one. 
DEBBIE Does it make you sad when you fight? 
CHARLOTTE I don't want anyone to fight. 
DEBBIE I love you.

Pete is sleeping on the couch.

CHARLOTTE Why isn't anybody talking? Why is it so quiet? 
PETE It's the sounds of silence. 
INT. CAR - DAY 
Pete is driving Sadie and Charlotte to school. On the stereo is "Paradise by the Dashboard Light" by Meatloaf. Pete is eating an egg sandwich and manically singing along. 
PETE (singing) I don't think that I can really survive... I'm praying for the end of time, it's all that I can do. Praying for the end of time, so I can end my time with you. 
SADIE Stop, Dad. 
PETE It was long ago and it was far away, it was so much better than it is today. 
The shades are closed and the room is dark. Sadie watches the end of the last episode of Lost on a laptop. Pete enters. 
PETE What are you doing? We need to get ready for the party. 
SADIE (devastated) I just finished the last episode of Lost. 
PETE We don't have time for this right now. We have a lot of people coming over-- 
SADIE (losing it) They're all dead. 
PETE What? 
SADIE Jack, Kate, Sawyer... 
PETE I don't care about the show right now- 
SADIE Jin, Sun... 
PETE Okay? I need you to just get in the shower. Get dressed. Let's just put it on hold. 
SADIE Walt, Juliet. All those people. 
PETE Don't think about Lost today. Tomorrow: Lost. All day. I can't wait to hear about it. Jack? No way. Really? Right now, shower. 
SADIE I don't make fun of your stupid Mad Men. 
PETE First of all, I don't get worked up over Mad Men. 
SADIE That's because Mad Men sucks. 
PETE What Don Draper has gone through beats whatever Jack is running from on some island. 
SADIE A bunch of people smoking in an office, it's stupid. 
PETE You're getting me off topic. Please get dressed. 
EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
Debbie is speaking with Barb as they set up the kitchen for a barbecue for Pete's fortieth birthday. 
DEBBIE I am so glad you're here. I need a buffer in case it gets weird. 
BARB Well, I'm ready to buff. 
DEBBIE Here, grab these napkins. 
INT./EXT. HOUSE - DAY 
Desi jumps in the pool in a small bikini. She is playing in the water with the kids. 
ANGLE ON BARRY AND PETE 
BARRY So that's the girl who works for you. 
PETE Yeah, that's her. 
BARRY Seems nice. My wife would never let me have a hot employee like that. (MORE) 
BARRY (CONT'D) Everyone that works for us looks like they've been in some kind of horrible accident. 
Angle on Barb and Debbie. 
BARB You're comfortable with that around your husband? 
DEBBIE Pete wouldn't know what to do with that. 
Angle on Barry and Pete. 
BARRY You think our wives are looking at us right now? 
PETE Oh, definitely. 
Angle on Barb and Debbie. 
DEBBIE They look like pedophiles. 
Barry and Pete turn toward their wives, smile and wave. 
INT. KITCHEN - LATER 
Pete greets guests, including Graham and Grandma Molly. 
EXT. BACKYARD - LATER 
Pete and Ronnie are talking in the backyard. 
DEBBIE (O.C.) Hey, Pete! 
Debbie walks over with Jason. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Jason's here. 
JASON Peter, hi. 
PETE Hey, how's it going? 
JASON Great, you look well. How do you like what I've been doing to your girl? How do you like Debbie's after body? 
RONNIE It's nice. 
JASON Come on, show `em. Look at this. (points to her ass) It's beautiful. Look at that after- ass. Now it starts here, but it used to start here. And I brought it up. You're welcome. 
RONNIE Are you a trainer? 
JASON Yes, well, but not just physical. Spiritual. I'm sort of a guide. 
DEBBIE Hey guys. 
LARRY Look how big the kids are. Sadie! 
He gives Desi a hug. 
DESI Hi, Larry. 
LARRY (to Sadie) Hi, Sadie. 
SADIE Mom. Who is Oliver? 
DEBBIE What do you mean? 
CHARLOTTE Is he your dad? 
DEBBIE He is my biological father. 
CHARLOTTE What does that mean? 
DEBBIE He and my mom had a baby and that was me. 
SADIE Oh, so you're our grandpa. 
OLIVER Why don't you ask your mother? 
DEBBIE Yes, well, that would make him your grandpa. Do you want him to be? 
CHARLOTTE Yes. Then we get another grandpa. Come on! 
Oliver gets up. Charlotte, Sadie and Desi run off. Oliver follows. 
LARRY That was deeply uncomfortable. Thank god the pretty girl was here to divert our attention. 
EXT. POOL - DAY 
Desi is gracefully swimming under water. She looks gorgeous. She sees Jason and Ronnie under water, but they look grotesque, red-faced and awkward. They both reach for each other and come to the surface. 
JASON Oh, hi. I did not see you there. 
RONNIE I saw you there. 
DESI Did you guys come together? Are you a couple? 
RONNIE / JASON No, we didn't come together. Absolutely not. 
DESI Sorry, the mustache is a little-- 
JASON That's fair. 
DESI I just assumed. 
RONNIE This is a straight man mustache. 
DESI What is the different between a gay man's mustache and a straight man's mustache? 
Pause. 
JASON The smell. 
DESI Excuse me. 
Desi swims away. 
EXT. BACKYARD - LATER 
Larry is talking to Oliver. 
LARRY So, spinal surgery just seems to me to be at the top of the surgery chain. 
OLIVER Well, we're not cardio, we're not neuro, but I like to think we're an important part of the spectrum. 
LARRY Do you operate every single day? 
OLIVER Most days. 
LARRY Multiple times a day? 
OLIVER Three, four times. 
LARRY So what's the price range? Like if I wanted-- 
OLIVER Oh, I'd rather not say. 
LARRY It's so big you're embarrassed to say. 
OLIVER I wouldn't say embarrassed. 
LARRY Are there hunchbacks today? 
OLIVER Of course. 
LARRY I've never seen one. 
OLIVER Well, that's because there are spinal surgeons. 
LARRY That's because of you. Each time I don't see a hunchback, you're getting that much richer. 
Oliver smiles, amused. 
LARRY (CONT'D) You like The Beatles, don't you? 
OLIVER Who doesn't like The Beatles? 
LARRY Nobody. 
EXT. BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
LARRY When was the last time you two saw each other, if you don't mind me asking? 
OLIVER Actually, we had lunch together last week. 
LARRY And before that? 
OLIVER It's been about seven years. 
LARRY Seven years? That's a joke, right? That's like two Olympics. And I'm the bad guy. What Debbie doesn't understand is that it's not bad to help out a parent. And it's certainly not bad for a parent to help out a child. I'm sure Oliver would agree. 
DEBBIE Are you really doing this right now? 
LARRY Am I doing what? I didn't start the toast. 
DEBBIE Are you really about to hit up my dad for money? 
LARRY What? He does four operations a day. It's perfect. It helps everybody, and it relieves his guilt from all the abandonment issues. 
DEBBIE You can't buy forgiveness, right Pete? 
PETE I don't think anyone's looking for handouts... We'd pay him back. 
OLIVER If you two are in a bind I'd be more than happy to help. 
DEBBIE No. It's not good to borrow money from family members because it causes resentment, remember? 
PETE Yeah. 
LARRY What do you want me to do? Admit that my life is shit? Is that what you want me to say? You happy? Aren't I allowed a little joy with these children I never wanted to have? 
DEBBIE You have never once stopped asking us for money. 
LARRY Family helps family. 
PETE It's true. Family helps family. Look, I don't expect you to fully understand. Your dad left. You're broken inside. It's not your fault you can't feel love. There's something that you can't -- this is coming out wrong. 
DEBBIE You know what? I would rather have my dad than your dad, because he doesn't drive me crazy. You know the best quality my father has? He asks for nothing. I don't know what the fuck he's thinking right now. Look at that. Nothing. I don't even know him. And I turned out perfectly fine without his input. 
LARRY I just figured out what your problem is. You hate Jews. Which is so odd because your children are Jewish. 
DEBBIE Don't play the Jew card, Larry. 
LARRY I'm not playing any Jew card. 
DEBBIE Seriously, it's used up. 
LARRY You can't use up a Jew card. That's the whole point of a Jew card. 
BARRY That's right. You can't use it up, it goes forever. 
OLIVER You know what? I have to go. 
Oliver gets up to leave. 
PETE Great. What a big surprise. Bye Oliver. See you later. See you in another seven years. Make sure to say goodbye to the grandkids, who you met today. You know, nothing I do is right because of you? Nothing. No matter how hard I try, I'm just the asshole here, but you know what I realized? It's you. You're the asshole. 
OLIVER Good luck working that out. Happy birthday and go fuck yourself. 
Oliver walks out. 
LARRY See you when the Cubs win the Pennant. 
BARB I'm going to light the candles. Get it going. 
LARRY Maybe we should try the toast again. 
DEBBIE Can you be quiet? (to Pete) You just threw me under the bus. 
PETE No. We agreed to let go and forgive, but then you started ripping into my dad like a crazy person. 
DEBBIE I'm not ripping into your dad. I'm just saying to him what you say to me. 
PETE Don't be such a ball buster. 
DEBBIE I am not a ball buster. You make me one! I am a fun girl! I am fun- loving! I am a good time Sally! I dance hip-hop. I cannot believe I've wasted my whole life busting the balls of people who have no balls. I am the only one here who has any balls. 
EXT. BACKYARD - DAY 
Graham Parker sings "Happy Birthday" to Pete as Charlotte accompanies him on a keyboard. The party is tense. 
Debbie looks over and sees that Oliver never actually left. He stands in the back looking uncomfortable, quietly singing. She's shocked he's still there. 
EXT. HOUSE - DAY - LATER 
Debbie smokes a cigarette at the side of the house. Sadie appears. 
SADIE Mom? 
Debbie turns, caught. 
SADIE (CONT'D) Mom! What are you doing? 
DEBBIE What? 
SADIE You're smoking? In the front yard? 
DEBBIE No, they're Barb's. 
She walks away towards the house. Sadie follows. 
INT./EXT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
Sadie storms through the front door after Debbie. 
Debbie is stunned. 
DEBBIE I don't even know you. You can't just come into my house and reminisce. 
OLIVER (walking out) Look, maybe we were just not meant to be in each other's lives. I'm not sure this was such a great idea. 
Debbie follows him out the door and onto the front porch. She closes the door behind them. 
EXT. FRONT PORCH - CONTINUOUS 
DEBBIE Hey, wait a minute. You did leave. And you didn't come back. 
OLIVER (getting agitated) My first life was ruined. I did my best with my second. 
DEBBIE So I ruined your life? I was eight. 
OLIVER People do better when I stay out of their lives. That's what my son tells me. You think my life is so perfect? I've got a thirteen-year- old who's a pot head, I've got a wife who's keeping Zoloft alive. 
DEBBIE You never said that before. 
OLIVER You don't think I want to talk to you about this? To share it with you? It's just not our way! We don't talk to each other, we don't know each other. I thought that's the way you wanted it. How do I get out of this? How do I get you all to just help me down off the cross? 
Debbie looks at him for a moment. 
DEBBIE You sound just like Sadie. 
OLIVER Who's Sadie? No. Your daughter, your younger? 
DEBBIE The big one. 
OLIVER Your older. I know that! She's a wonderful girl. 
Larry opens the door and peeks out. We reveal that everyone at the party (except Pete) is still standing in the foyer. 
LARRY Hi, guys. Some of us need to leave. Would this be a good moment to sneak out? 
From the side of the house we see Pete storming by on his bike, wearing his street clothes and a helmet. 
SADIE Where's Dad going? 
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY 
Pete exits his home riding his bike. He is very angry. He rides with great emotion like he is trying to get all the frustration out of his body. 
PETE Best birthday ever! 
Pete rides his bike onto San Vicente Boulevard. 
Pete rides down the street. A CAR passes by him. When it does a fifteen-year-old TEENAGER sticks his head out the window and yells to scare Pete. 
TEENAGER Bike lane, asshole! 
Pete almost falls. 
PETE Fuck you, you Twilight pimply-ass motherfuckers! 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
Debbie and Barb are cleaning up. They look out the window to see Oliver picking up glasses and putting them in a bin. 
BARB Your dad's still here. 
DEBBIE I know. It's weird. Where the hell is Pete? 
Sadie walks in with Joseph. 
SADIE Mom, is it okay if Joseph hangs out here for a while? 
DEBBIE Sure. Hi, Joseph. 
JOSEPH Hi. 
DEBBIE Do you want a piece of cake? 
JOSEPH Oh, yeah sure. Thank you. 
Sadie walks off. 
JOSEPH (CONT'D) All right, then. 
Joseph follows. 
BARB They are so cute. 
DEBBIE So cute. 
BARB He looks exactly like Tom Petty. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
There is no bike lane and cars going very fast have to swerve to avoid Pete. A car honks when traffic clogs up behind him. 
PETE Go around! 
A car makes a right turn, and Pete almost rides right into it. 
PETE (CONT'D) Watch it! 
He pulls up alongside Jason's van. Desi is riding with Jason. 
DESI Hey, Pete. Great party! 
They speed off. 
PETE Yeah. The best! 
MAN IN RANGE ROVER Don't disrespect me. 
INT. DEBBIE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Debbie watches Pete fall to the ground. She opens the car door and starts to run over toward him. 
LARRY Are you sure that's him? I don't think that's him. 
EXT. STREET- CONTINUOUS 
As the man starts his engine, Debbie runs toward Pete. 
PETE (in pain) I'm going to write down your license plate number. 
The car drives away, revealing that it is new and has dealer's plates with no numbers. 
PETE (CONT'D) "Range Rover of Sunland." 
Debbie reaches him and holds his head up. 
DEBBIE What are you doing? 
PETE Ow. 
INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
Debbie and Larry sit in the waiting area of the hospital. 
LARRY I guess the party didn't turn out like you planned. 
DEBBIE It wasn't a good party. 
A NURSE walks over to them. 
NURSE Hi. I'll bring you in as soon as his x-rays are finished. 
DEBBIE Is he okay? 
NURSE Yeah, he has a broken rib and he's been crying a little bit, but he'll be fine. 
The Nurse walks away. 
LARRY You know Pete was never a real fighter. But that's why he married you. That's why he loves you. Because you're the fighter, and you need that. One person in a relationship has got to punch. 
DEBBIE Do you mean that in a good way? 
LARRY Oh, it's a high compliment. 
DEBBIE Thanks. 
LARRY Listen, I know what you're worried about. You think he's going to turn into me, but I don't think it's going to happen. He's smarter and probably a little cuter. A little less Jewy. Although, after fifty, that's all going to change. Be prepared to wake up one day with a a rabbi. But the good news is, he'll love you forever. That's in our DNA. We stick around. 
DEBBIE He worries about you. It puts a lot of pressure on him. 
LARRY I know. I just don't have anyone else to talk to about it. 
DEBBIE You can talk to Claire. 
LARRY No. If I open up to her she'll leave me. 
DEBBIE No, she won't, Larry, she loves you. 
LARRY I know, but there's a certain point at which you just can't stay. (beat) I guess it's hard to forgive somebody if they don't formally apologize to you. 
DEBBIE Are you apologizing? 
LARRY I'm very close. (beat) Yes, I'm sorry. And I'm glad everybody's okay. 
DEBBIE Thanks. 
She hugs him and starts to cry a little bit. 
LARRY I'm off. 
DEBBIE Okay. 
LARRY This is awkward. 
DEBBIE What? 
LARRY I need forty dollars for a cab. 
DEBBIE (laughing) That's funny. 
LARRY No, I'm not kidding. You drove me. I wasn't prepared. 
DEBBIE I only have a hundred. 
LARRY That's okay. I'll bring you the change. 
He grabs the bill out of her purse and walks off. 
LARRY (CONT'D) All right, give him a kiss for me. 
INT. HOUSE - NIGHT 
Oliver is sitting on the couch with Charlotte and Sadie watching the last scene of Lost. Joseph has joined them. 
OLIVER I don't get it. 
SADIE See, it's not sad, it's happy because they helped each other achieve their destiny. 
OLIVER Oh. 
CHARLOTTE Great. I'm going to have some freaky ass nightmares.

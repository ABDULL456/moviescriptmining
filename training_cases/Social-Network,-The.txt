FROM THE BLACK WE HEAR-- 
MARK (V.O.) Did you know there are more people with genius IQ's living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States? 
ERICA (V.O. ) That can't be true. 
MARK (V.O.) it is true. 
ERICA (V.O.) What would account for that? 
MARK (V.0.) Well first of all, a lot of people live in China. But here's my question: 
FADE IN 
INT. CAMPUS BAR - NIGHT 
MARK ZUCKERBERG is a sweet looking 19 year old whose lack of any physically intimidating attributes masks a very complicated and dangerous anger. He has trouble making eye contact- and sometimes it's hard to tell if he's talking to you or to himself. 
ERICA, also 19, is Mark's date. She has a girl-next-door face that makes her easy to fall for. At this point in the conversation she already knows that she'd rather not be there and her politeness is about to be tested. 
The scene is stark and simple. 
MARK How do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1600 on their SAT's? 
ERICA I didn't know they take SAT's in China. 
MARK I wasn't talking about China anymore, I was talking about here. 
ERICA You got 1600? 
MARK You can sing in an a Capella group. 
BRICA Does that mean that you actually got nothing wrong? 
MARK Or you row crew or you invent a 25 dollar PC. 
ERICA Or you get into a final club. 
MARK Or you get into a final club, exactly. 
ERICA I like guys who row crew. 
MARK 
(BEAT) Well I can't do that. And yes, it means I got nothing wrong on the test. 
ERICA Have you ever tried? 
MARK I'm trying now. 
ERICA To row crew? 
MARK To get into a final club. To row crew? No. Are you, like--whatever--crazy? 
ERICA Sometimes, Mark-seriously-YOU say two things at once and I'm not sure which one we're talking about. 
MARK But you've seen guys who row crew, right? 
ERICA No. 
MARK Okay, well.. they're bigger than me. They're world class athletes. And a second ago you said you like guys who row crew so I assumed you'd met one. 
ERICA I guess I meant I liked the idea of it. The way a girl likes cowboys. 
MARK The Phoenix is good. 
ERICA This is a new topic? 
MARK It's the same topic. 
ERICA We're still talking about the finals clubs? 
MARK Would you rather talk about something else? 
ERICA It's just that since the beginning of the conversation about finals clubs I think I may have had a birthday. 
MARK We can change the subject. 
ERICA. (can't get over it) There are more people in China with genius IQ's than the entire population of-- 
MARK It's about exclusivity. 
T'RICA .....what is? 
MARK The final clubs. And that's how you distinguish yourself. The Phoenix is the most diverse. The Fly Club, Roosevelt punched the Porc. 
ERICA Which one? 
MARK The Porcellian, the Porc, it's the best of the best. 
ERICA I actually meant which Roosevelt. 
MARK Theodore. 
ERICA Okay, well, which is the easiest one to get into? 
MARK takes a cigarette from a pack, lights it, takes a drag and blows the smoke out before he says... 
MARK Hm. 
ERICA What? 
MARK why would you ask me that? 
ERICA I was just asking. 
MARK They're all hard to get into. My friend Eduardo made $300,000 betting on oil futures last summer and he won't get in. Money or the ability to make it doesn't impress anybody around here. Everybody can do that. 
ERICA He made $300,000 in a summer? 
MARK He likes meteorology. 
ERICA You said it was oil futures. 
MARK If you can predict the weather you can predict the price of heating oil. You asked me that because you think the final club that's easiest to get into is the one where I'll have the best chance, 
ERICA 
MARK And I'm sorry T don't have a rowboat. 
ERICA I think we should just be friends. 
MARK I don't need friends. 
ERICA OF I was being polite, I had no intention being friends with you. 
MARK You're really leaving. ERICA takes MARK's hand and looks at him tenderly.. 
ERICA 
(CLOSE) Listen, You're going to be successful and rich. But you're going to go through life thinking that girls don't like you because you're a tech geek. And I want you to know, from the bottom of my heart, that that won't be true. It'll be because you're an asshole. 
And with that stinger, ERICA walks off and we stay on MARK as the pulsing intro to Paul Young's "Love of the Common People" 
CRASHES IN---- 
ERICA (CONT'D) (calling over her shoulder) And you're never getting into a final club. Along with the MUSIC, we slowly push in on MARK. A fuse has just been lit.

CUT TO: 
EXT. HARVARD SQUARE - NIGHT 
As MARK continues on, he passes a group of people heading in the opposite direction for a party. As MARK's steady and determined stride continues, he'll. pass by all kinds of (seemingly) happy, well-adjusted, socially adept people. The vocals from the Paul Young song come in--

WE 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
A bedroom that's part of a three-bedroom suite. The MUSIC CONTINUES as MARK walks in, flicks his lap-top on without looking at it and walks out of frame as we stay on the laptop.

AND SHE CAN Then a moment or two later, a glass with ice gets set down next to the lap-top. Then a carton of orange juice followed by a bottle of vodka. MARK's fingers dance easily on the keyboard---like a Juilliard pianist warming up. In the exact time it takes him to pour the vodka and orange juice over ice, the website he's just called up gets loaded onto the screen. Zuckonit.com This is the only place he's comfortable. 
TITLE: 
8:13 PM He begins blogging. 
MARY, (V.0.) Erica Albright'â¢s a bitch. You think that's because her family changed their name from Albrecht or do you think it's because all B.U, girls are bitches? He takes a good gulp of his drink. We see the words we're hearing filling up his computer screen-- 
MARK (V,O.) (CONT'D) Folks, for the record, she may look like a 34D but she's getting all kinds of help from our friends at Victoria's Secret, She's a 348, as in barely anything there.. False advertising. 
CUT TO: 
INT. MARX'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
Fresh ice gets dropped in the glass and a new drink poured. "Love of the Common People" continues. 
TITLE: 
9:48 PM in back of MARK, sitting on the bed and hitting a bong, is 
BILLY. OLSEN. 
MARK (V.O.) The truth is she has a nice face. I need to think of something to help me take my mind off her. Easy enough, except I need an idea. MARK has moved his mouse to an icon on his desktop labeled "Kirkland Facebook". He clicks and opens it. A menu of photos appear. He blogs again. 
MARK (V.0.) (CONT'D) I'm a little intoxicated, I'm not gonna lie. So what if it's not even 10PM and it's a Tuesday night? The Kirkland Facebook is open on my desktop and some of these people have pretty horrendous f acebook-pics. Billy Olson's sitting here and had the idea of putting some of these girls' faces next to pictures of farm animals and have people vote on who's hotter. . 
CUT TO: 
INT. FINAL CLUB - NIGHT 
We'll be cutting back here a lot in this sequence, with the Paul Young song tying them together, as we show---mostly MOS--- preparations under way for the hottest party on campus tonight. We start on a good looking STUDENT fixing his tie in the bathroom mirror. He walks out of the bathroom and into the main area where he's immediately tossed a bottle of champagne by a similarly dressed STUDENT. We see that there are a couple of dozen other guys around. Our guy takes the champagne bottle and sticks it on the bar, which is being stocked by two sexy FEMALE uniformed BARTENDERS. Our guy walks past P. DJ's table where the DJ is setting up his incredibly high-end equipment. Our guy trots down a set of mahogany and red-carpet stairs, opens a heavy door and looks out to the sidewalk. 
A BOUNCER in a tuxedo is standing by a velvet rope which is holding back three dozen STUDENTS. The students are mostly women and the women are all dressed to catch a man. Over all this, we HEAR MARK CONTINUINGâ 
MARK (V.0.) Good call, Mr. Olson! I think he's on to something. 
TITLE: 
10:17 PM 
MARK (V.0.) (CONT'D) year it's on. I'm not gonna do the farm animals but I like the idea of comparing two people together. It gives the whole thing a very Turing feel since people's ratings of the pictures will be more implicit than, say, choosing a number to represent each person's hotness like they do on hotornot.com. The first thing we're going to need is a lot of pictures. Unfortunately, Harvard doesn't keep a public centralized facebook so I'm going to have to get all the images from the individual houses that people are in. Let the hacking begin.

1 + 10(RA _ RB) / 400 
EDUARDO Give each.girl a.-base rating of 1400. At any time `Girl All has a rating R-a and "Girl B" has a rating R-b. 
MARK S When any two girls are matched up there' an expectation of which will win based on their current rating.

INT. DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY 
It's three years later and MARK is sitting with his LAWYERS at a large conference table. 
MARK is wearing a hoodie, sweatpants and Adidas flip-flops--a personal uniform that we'll come to understand. And while it may take us a while to notice it, MARK's a different person in these flash-forward scenes. Still tortured and complicated, but comfortable now with his own power. His lawyer is SY, who's accompanied by some junior associates, one of whom--a pleasant, pretty and professional young contemporary of Mark's named MARYLIN, we'll get to know. On the other side are EDUARDO and his lawyer, GRETCHEN, also a. â¢ mpanied by some associates. A STENOGRAPHER is typing the recor.. The room is glass on two sides and through the windows we can see the behemoths of Silicon valley--Oracle, SunMicrosystems, Google, etc. GRETCHEN is taking MARK's deposition. 
GRETCHEN So you were called in front of the Ad Board. 
MARK That's not what happened. 
GRETCHEN You weren't called in front of the Administrative Board? 
MARK No, back, I mean--That's--back at the bar with Erica Albright. She said all that? That I said that stuff to her? 
GRETCHEN i was reading from the transcript of her 
DEPOSITION SO-- 
MARK why would you even need to depose her? 
GRETCHEN That's really for us to-- 
MARK You think if I know she can make me look like a. jerk I'll be more likely-- 
SY 
MARKÂ 
MARK --to settle, right? 
SY Why don't we stretch our legs a minute, can we do that? It's been almost three hours and frankly you did spend an awful lot of time embarrassing Mr. Zuckerberg with the girl's testimony in the bar. 
MART I'm not embarrassed, it's just that she made a lot of that up. 
GRETCHEN She was under oath. 
MARK Then I guess that would be the first time somebody's lied under oath. People are stretching and getting coffee and talking quietly. MARK stays in his seat. MARYLIN, the attractive second year associate who's on Mark's legal team is still sitting too... about four seats down from Mark. 
MARYLIN Eight percent of the male population of Harvard had been on it within two hours? 
MARK 
(BEAT) Eighty. 
MARYLIN What? 
MARK ' ' Eighty percent of the male population. 
MARYLIN 
(PAUSE--EVEN) Wow.

EXT. CHARLES RIVER - DAWN 
The Harvard Crew is practicing on two-man sculls. There are three boats that are running roughly even with each other and the two-man crews are rowing with all they've got. We're gliding along with them in the water-- 
CREW MEMBER 
(SHOUTING) Bring up the rate! 2 in 2! One..two-- 
ANOTHER CREW MEMBER (DIFFERENT 
BOAT) Power 10 in 2! In 2! 
A THIRD CREW MEMBER (DIFFERENT 
BOAT) They had open water after a hundred meters. I don't think we're gonna catch 'em today. And we PULL BACK TO REVEAL that there's a fourth boat which is already five boat, ngths ahead of the other three. 
The fourth boat is being crewed by CAMERON and TYLER WINKLEVOSS----identical twins who stepped out of an ad for Abercrombie and Fitch. They know that the others aren't in their class and even though they're highly competitive athletes, they don't like showing anyone up, least of all their teammates. 
CAMERON Is there anyway to make this a fair fight? 
TYLER We could jump out and swim. 
CAMERON I think we'd have to jump out and drown. 
TYLER I'm not willing to do that. 
CAMERON What are we at three-quarter power? Let's drop down to a half. 
TYLER Or you could row forward and I could row backward. 
CAMERON I'd kick your ass. 
TYLER We're genetically identical, so biology and mathematics says we'd stay in one place not allowing for the current or the wind. 
CAMERON Just row the boat. 
And the WINI{LEVOSS twins kick into full gear and open up an even wider lead as we. 
CUT. TO: 
INT. DINING HALL - MORNING 
Two stacks of The Crimson, Harvard's student newspaper, get dropped on the floor as TYLER and CAMERON walk by--their trays loaded with mountains of eggs and pancakes and carbs. Everyone knows and loves them in this 200 year old dining hall and they wave and shout to a few people and whisper to a couple of very pretty girls before taking a seat next to DIVYA NARENDRA, a nice looking Indian student whose face is in a copy of the Crimson. 
CAMERON What's up? 
DIVYA You guys hear about this? 
CAMERON What? 
DIVYA Two nights ago a sophomore at Kirkland crashed the computers. 
CAMERON Which computers? 
DIVYA All of them. Be crashed the whole system. TYLER picks up a copy-of the Crimson and begins reading while his brother and DIVYA keep talking. 
CAMERON How? 
DIVYA He set up a website where you vote on the hotness of female Harvard undergrads. What were we doing that none of us heard about this? 
CAMERON I don't know. Rowing, going to class, studying? How much activity was there on this thing that he crashed the--

CAMERON No, you didn't insult our girl-- 
(TO TYLER) Actually, I don't know. 
TYLER

CAMERON We should do that.

INT. PORCELLIAN CLUB - DAY 
The most exclusive of all the final clubs. DIIVYA is sitting in the main living room with a textbook open as the heavy wooden door opens and MARK is escorted in by TYLER and CAMERON. 
TYLER You ever been in the Porcellian? 
MARK No. 
TYLER We can't take you past the living room but we can sit here and talk. 
DIVYA H i.. MARK is stealing a glance around the room... 
CAMERON Mark? This is Divya Narendra, our partner. 
MARK Hi. 
DIVYA We were really impressed with Facemash and then we checked you out and you also built CourseMatch. MARK is looking at the framed black and white group pictures on the wall. of old Porcellian classes. He sees a pretty co-ed on the couch with her legs stretched over her boyfriend while they study. 
DIVYA (CONT'D) Mark? 
MARK Yeah . 
CAMERON CourseMatch. You go online, you get to see what courses your friends are taking?

DIVYA MARK gives a short shrug that says both "I don't know" and "Fuck you" at the same time.

MARK Yeah. How's this different from MySpace or Friendster? 
TYLER How? 
MARK Yeah. 
TYLER Harvard-dot-E--D-U. 
CAMERON Harvard.edu. The most prestigious e-mail address in the country. 
TYLER This site would be based on the idea that girls want to meet guys who go to Harvard. The difference between what we're talking about and MySpace, 
FRIENDSTER--- 
MARK --is exclusivity, 
(BEAT) Right? 
TYLER 
(BEAT) Yes. 
(PAUSE Yeah. I think I've come up with something. Come outside.

EXT. QUAD NIGHT 
MARK and EDUARDO come outside and are immediately met by the freezing cold air. 
MARK People came to Facemash in a stampede, right? 
EDUARDO Yeah. 
MARK It wasn't because I put up pictures of hot girls. You can go anywhere on the internet and see pictures of hot girls. 
EDUARDO Yeah. 
MARK It was because I put up pictures of girls that people knew. So if people Want to go on the internet and check out their friends, why can't I build a website that offers that? An online community of friends. Pictures, profiles, whatever you can click into, visit, browse around. All from the privacy of your dorm room. I'm not talking about a dating site. I'm talking about taking the entire social structure of college and putting it online. 
EDUARDO I can't feel my legs.

CUT TO: 
INT. FIRST DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY 
EDUARDO I told him I thought it sounded great. I mean it did, it was a great idea. There was no reason to hack, people were going to put their own pictures up. What they were interested in, what they were looking for, what classes they were taking... and people had the ability to invite their friends to join. Or put a different way, not invite their friends to join. In a world where social structure is very important, that was sexy.

MARK Because you've got e-mails for everyone at the Phoenix. 
EDUARDO 
(BEAT) I'm not sure if it's gonna be cool with them that I spammed their-- 
MARK It's not Spam. 
EDUARDO I didn't mean Spam, it's not Spam, it's 
JUST THAT-- 
MARK If we send it to our friends it'll just bounce around the computer lab, 
EDUARDO I haven't gotten in yet. 
MARK These guys know people and these guys know girls. I need their e-mails. 
EDUARDO 
(BEAT) Sure. EDUARDO takes out his laptop-- 
MARK Let's start with the president. 
EDUARDO "Jabberwockl2@Harvard E-D-U." 
MARK Like the Lewis Carrol? 
EDUARDO Yeah. MARK opens up an e-mail and is writing a short message, then includes a link to the site-- 
MARK These guys. 
EDUARDO I know, 
MARK Think they're literary geniuses because the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll reference is in their-- 
EDUARDO They're not so bad.

EDUARDO You're right. 
MARK

MARK (CONT'D) The site's live. 
EDUARDO 
(PAUSE) You know what? Let's go get a drink and celebrate. MARK is staring at the computer... 
EDUARDO (CONT'D) Mark? MARK doesn't hear him. We just see MARK's head from the back and it's ever so slightly bobbing back and forth... 
EDUARDO (CONT'D) 
(PAUSE) Mark? 
(BEAT) Are you praying? 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAMPUS PUB - NIGHT 
THE CROCODILLOS, Harvard's oldest male a Capella group, are singing at the front of the pub in their usual uniform of white tie and tails. Incongruously, but with surprisingly nice results, the group is covering a song from The Backstreet-Boys--"I Want it That Way"--and the pub full of students is loving it. We find a table in the back where DIVYA is sitting with some of his friends who are having a nice time. DIVYA's got his laptop open. 
MALE FRIEND When did the Crocodillos start covering the Backstreet Boys? What happened to Cole Porter and Irving Berlin? 
FEMALE FRIEND It's a Valentine's theme. They're singing love songs. 
MALE FRIEND Good point, 'cause Cole Porter and Irving Berlin never wrote any love songs, 
FEMALE FRIEND Divya, what are you reading? 
DIVYA Seven different people spammed me the same link. We see DIVYA click his mouse on the link-- 
FEMALE FRIEND What is it? 
DIVYA 
(DRYL Y) I don't know, but I'm really hoping it's video of kittens that look like the Marx Brothers 'cause I can never get enough file footage on my computer of animals doing... DIVYA trails off. We Slowly PUSH IN on his face as the blood starts draining away... 
MALE FRIEND 
(PAUSE) Div? 
DIVYA (beat.) I--uh...I have to go. DIVYA shuts his laptop, grabs it off the table and starts to bolt out of the pub. His foot gets caught on a chair leg and he falls hard face-first to the floor. 
DIVYA (CONT'D) Shit. He starts out again, then comes back for his coat, grabs it; starts out and falls down all over again. Finally he's got it together and flies out of the pub and we

INT. BOATHOUSE - NIGHT 
CAMERON and TYLER are rowing in a large practice tank--a simulator with a hull, oars and rowable water. 
They're focused and charging away in perfect sync when the door at the end of the century-old boathouse opens and DIVYA charges In from the co:Ld with his laptop and a copy of the Crimson in his hands. 
DIVYA 
(CALLING) Hey! The twins are in the zone and don't pay any attention. 
DIVYA (CONT'D) 
(LOUDER) Hey ! 
CAMERON Not now, we've got another 5000 meters. 
DIVYA 
(CALMLY) Okay. I just wanted to let you know Zuckerberg stole our website. TYLER stops rowing and then CAMERON. They look at DIVYA... 
DIVYA (CONT'D) Mark Zuckerberg stole our website. It's been live for over 36 hours. 
DIVYA A cease and desist letter doesn't have any teeth. 
CAMERON You think we should hire lawyers and sue him? 
DIVYA I think we should hire lawyers and have them beat him senseless with a crescent wrench. 
TYLER We don't have to do that. 
CAMERON That's right. 
TYLER We can do it ourselves. 
CAMERON 
HEY-- 
TYLER I'm six-five, 220-pounds and there are two of me. 
CAMERON And I'm saying let's Calm down until we know what we're talking about. 
DIVYA Just how much more information are you waiting for? We met with Mark three times, we exchanged 52 e-mails, we can prove that he looked at the code, he'd seen what Victor had already done and we talked at length about what we planned to do. 
(POINTING) The page looks the same: 
(THEN) What is that on the bottom? 
CAMERON (he's already seen it) It says "A Mark Zuckerberg Production". 
DIVYA On the home page? 
CAMERON On every page. 
DIVYA Hang on, 'cause I need a minute to let the classiness waft over me. 
CAMERON 
LOOK- 
TYLER 
(CALMLY) Cam. (he recites from the Crimson thout having to read it) They wr "Zuckerberg said that he hoped the prly options would help to restore his reputation following student outrage over Facemash.com". 
(BEAT) That's exactly what we said to him. He's telling us to go fuck ourselves. We know plenty of people at the Crimson. While we're waiting for dad's lawyer to look this over, we can at least--- 
CAMERON No. 
TYLER --get something going in the paper so that people know- 
CAMERON What? 
TYLER That this thing is in dispute. 
CAMERON We're not starting a knife fight in the Crimson and we're not suing anybody. 
DIVYA Why not? CAMERON wants-to answer the question but doesn't.. 
DIVYA (CONT'D) Why not? 
CAMERON (beat--referring to TYLER) He'll say it's stupid. 
TYLER Me? 
CAMERON Yeah. 
DIVYA Say it. Why not? 
CAMERON Because we're gentlemen of Harvard. 
(BEAT) This is Harvard. You don't plant stories and you don't sue people. 
(BEAT) That's why. There's a right way to do things. 
DIVYA

INT. SECOND DEPOSITION ROOM - DAY 
GAGE During the time when you say you had this idea, did you know that Cameron and Tyler carne from a family of means? 
MARK 
(PAUSE) A family of means? 
GAGE Did you know that his father was wealthy. 
MARK 
(PAUSE) I'm not sure why you're asking me that. 
GAGE It's not important that you be sure why I'm asking you. 
MARK It's not important to you. 
GAGE (asking for help again) Sy. 
'SY 
(TO MARK) Did you know that they came from money? 
MARK I had no idea whether they came from money or not. 
GAGE In one of your e-mails to Mr. Narendra you reference Tate Winklevoss' consulting firm. 
MARY 
(BEAT) If you say so. 
GAGE Tate Winklevoss founded the firm and its assets are in the hundreds of millions. 
MARK or roughly the amount I paid in income tax last year, go on. 
GAGE You also knew that Cameron and Tyler were members of a Harvard final club called the Porcellian. 
MARK They made a point of pointing that out. 
TYLER Excuse us for inviting you in. 
GAGE 
(TO TYLER) Hey. 
(TO MARK) So it's safe to say you were aware that my clients had money? 
MARK 
(BEAT) It was Bill Gates. 
BOB Oh shit, that makes sense. As MARK and EDUARDO walk on, we leave STUART, VIKRAM and BOB in the background---with STUART and VIKRAM admonishing BOB with-- 
STUART/VIKRAM 
(TO BOB) Are you a moron?/Are you medically stupid?/You can't recognize Bill Gates when he's standing in front of you for an hour?/Mark Zuckerberg now thinks we got into Harvard on a dimwit scholarship./I'm gonna get a Glock 39 and I'm going to kill you./I'm actually going to kill you/etc.

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
As the door opens and MARK and EDUARDO come into the overheated warmth of the room. 
EDUARDO It's time to monetize the thing. 
MARK Those Asian girls were cute. What were their names? 
EDUARDO Did you hear what I said? 
MARK When? 
EDUARDO I said it's time to monetize the site. 
MARK What does that mean? 
EDUARDO I mean it's time for the website to generate revenue. 
MARK No I know what the word means. I'm asking how do you want to do it? 
EDUARDO Advertising. 
MARK No. What were their names? 
EDUARDO We've got 4000 members. 
MARK 'Cause theFacebook is cool. If we start installing pop-ups for Mountain Dew it's 
NOT GONNA-- 
EDUARDO Well I wasn't thinking it would be Mountain Dew but at some point--and I'm speaking as the business end of the 
COMPANY--THE SITE-- 
MARK We don't even know what it is yet. We don't know what it is, what it can be, what it will be. We know it'â¢s cool, that's a -priceless asset and we're not giving it up. EDUARDO is sitting at MARK's desk and he's seen something sitting on top of a pile of'books.,, 
EDUARDO Mark, what is this? 
MARK What, EDUARDO holds up a letter that's on a lawyer's stationary. 
EDUARDO This, 
MARK I think it's called a cease and desist letter. What were their names? 
EDUARDO Who? 
MARX The girls. EDUARDO's speed reading the letter. 
EDUARDO When did you get this? 
MARK About 10 days ago. Right after we launched the site. 
EDUARDO Jesus Christ. 
MARK I liked th shorter one. 
EDUARDO They're saying--the Winklevoss twins are saying you stole their idea. 
MARK I find that to be mildly annoying. 
EDUARDO They find it to be property theft. Why-- 
MARK 
LOOK-- 
EDUARDO --why didn't you show this to me? 
MARK It was addressed to me. 
EDUARDO They're saying we stole theFacebook from Divya Narendra and the Winkâ 
MARX I know what it says. 
EDUARDO 
(PAUSE) Did we? 
MARK What? 
EDUARDO Please don't screw around with me now. 
MARK I'm not. 
EDUARDO Look at me. 
MARK What are you, my mother? 
EDUARDO The letter says we could face legal action. 
MARK No, it says I could face legal action. 
EDUARDO It's from a lawyer, Mark. They must feel they have some grounds for-- 
MARK The lawyer is their father's house counsel, I checked it out, they're not, 
YOU KNOW--- 
EDUARDO Do they have grounds? 
MARK Yes, the grounds are theFacebook is cool. and popular and sexy and HarvardConnection is lame. I didn't use any of their code, I didn't use anything. A guy who builds a really nice chair doesn.'t owe money to everyone who,,, ever built a chair. Th ey came to me with an idea, I had a better one. 
EDUARDO Why didn't you show me the letter? 
MARK I didn't think. it was a big deal.. 
EDUARDO If there's' something wrong--if there's ever anything wrong--you can tell me. I'm the guy who can help. 
(PAUSE) - Is there anything you need to tell me? 
MARK No, 
EDUARDO What are we doing about this? 
EDUARDO 
(PAUSE) Mark. 
(BEAT) We have groupies. MARK can't help a smile. Then he sees something... 
MARK I'll be right back. 
EDUARDO Where you going? 
MARK makes his way through the crowd toward a round booth. A girl is sitting there and even though her back is to MARK he can recognize her. She's with a girlfriend and three guys. When he makes it to the booth he says-- 
MARK Erica? ERICA, from the opening scene, turns her head and looks up to see MARK. She's looking sexy for her Friday ni.ght on the town and the three guys she's with are studs. A few more friends of theirs are standing around at the edges of the booth. 
ERICA 
(PAUSE) Hi Mark. 
MARK I saw you from over there. I didn't know you came to this club a lot. 
ERICA It's my first time. 
MARK Mine too. It's not bad. It's not. great. The music's kind of lame. Could I talk to you alone for a second? 
ERICA I think I'm good right here. 
MARK okay. MARK is aware of everyone else around the booth. 
MARK (CONT'D) 
(BEAT) I don't know if you heard about this new website I launched. 
ERICA No. 
MARK ThePacebook? 
ERICA You called me a bitch on the internet, Mark. 
MARK I'm really sorry about that. 
ERICA On the internet. 
MARK That's why I came over. 
ERICA comparing women to farm animals? 
MARX I didn't end up doing that. 
ERICA It didn't stop you from writing it. As if every thought that tumbles through your head is so clever it would be a crime for it not to be published. The internet's not written in pencil, Mark, it's written in ink and you published that Erica Albright was a bitch. 
(BEAT) Right before you made some ignorant crack about my family's name, published my bra size and then rated women-based on their hotness. Why don't you say it to me now, why don't say it to my face? 
MARK I don't want to. 
REGGIE (A FRIEND OF ERICA'S) Erica, is there a problem? 
ERICA No, there's no problem. 
(PAUSE) You're not a real person, Mark. You write your bullshit from a dark room because you're a failure at human contact. I liked you and I was nice to you. 
MARK 
(PAUSE) I came over to say I was sorry for all that and to see if there was any chance-- 
ERICA I don't want to be rude to my fxiends, I should be talking to them. 
MARK Okay. 
ERICA Hey Mark. A year from now you won't remember this conversation and you won't remember me. 
MARK I think you're wrong. 
ERICA Well... listen, good luck with your video game. It was an honest mistake on ERICA's part but a kidney punch to 
MARK. 
MARK 
(BEAT) Okay. MARK turns and goes and sees that EDUARDO has been standing at and watching from a distance with JENNY. 
EDUARDO That was cool, you did good. You talked to her, that was the right thing to do. 
(BEAT) It was good, Mark. 
MARK 
(IGNORING HIM) We have to expand. 
EDUARDO (over the music) What? 
MARK We have to expand. And MARK heads out the door. EDUARDO watches MARK and then looks back at the girls and answers the un-asked question-- 
EDUARDO

INT. MARK'S DORM ROOM - NIGHT 
The door closes behind DUSTIN MOSKOWITZ and CHRIS HUGHES. MARK and EDUARDO are waiting and JENNY and ALICE are sitting on the bed. Everyone's got a beer. Once the door is closed-- 
MARK We're expanding theFacebook to Yale and Columbia. Dustin, I want you to share. the coding work with me. Chris, you're going to be in charge. of publicity and outreach. You can start by getting a story about the expansion in the B.U. student newspaper. 
CHRIS They hate doing stories about Harvard. 
MARK - Somebody at the newspaper will be a computer science major and they will have heard of me. Tell 'em Mark Zuckerberg will do 10 hours of free programming for theno . 
EDUARDO Why do you want a story in the B.U.--- 
MARK Because I do. Here's the business arrangement. Eduardo's CFO and owns 30% of the company, Dustin's Vice President and Head of Programming and his 5% of the company will come from my end. Chris is Director of Publicity and his compensation will depend on the amount of work he ends up doing. Any questions?

SEAN All night long, Sister Souljah. 
AMY You're a millionaire. 
SEAN Not technically. 
AMY What are you? 
SEAN Technically? 
AMY Yeah. 
SEAN Broke. There's not a lot of money in free music. Even less when you're being sued by everyone who's ever been invited to the Grammys. 
AMY I think you're cool. 
SEAN He too. 
AMY I have to hop in the shower and get ready for class. There's juice or anything else you can find. Help yourself. 
SEAN You mind if I check my e-mail? 
AMY Go ahead. AMY heads into the bathroom but leaves the door a little ajar.. SEAN steps over to AMY's pink laptop and hits a key to wake it out of sleep mode. The shower starts running in the bathroom. The laptop springs to life and is open to something SEAN's never seen before--a Facebook page.; He sees AMY's picture and a short profile: Her major at Stanford, courses she's taking, books she likes, clubs she's a. member of... 
SEAN 
(CALLING) Amy? She can't hear him in the shower. SEAN explores around a little more. He knows his way around a computer. He sees her "friends". Friend after friend after friend. 
SEAN (CONY' D ) (almost a whisper) Jesus. He gets up and goes to the bathroom door--

INT. PALO ALTO HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
The place is computer geek paradise. Computers are everywhere, along with some of the empty boxes they came in. Pizza boxes, Chinese food containers, empty beer bottles and white boards filled with indecipherable code fill the room. There are a couple of large mattresses on the floor and a large map of the U.S. with pins and tags showing the schools where they've already put Facebook and different pins showing the schools they're going for. As MARK walks to the door, he walks past ANDREW, who's sitting at a computer, writing code and completely oblivious to everything around him. 
MARK (snapping his fingers) Andrew. 
ANDREW Not now. 
MARK Good boy. MARK gets to the door and opens it. He's stunned to see SEAN PARKER standing there with his girlfriend, SHARON. They all look at each other for a moment--- 
SEAN Mark? 
MARK Sean? 
SEAN Do you live here? 
MARK Yeah. Do you? 
SEAN We were right across the street, we saw the chimney come-- 
MARK Yeah. 
SEAN Is anybody hurt?

SHARON I'm Sharon. 
SEAN This is my girlfriend, Sharon. She lives across the street and I was helping her move out when we saw the chimney--

SEAN You made the right choice.

SEA,'s looking around the place. DUSTIN and the INTERNS are standing off to the side, happy to be in the presenbe of Sean Parker. ANDREW'S still locked into his computer. MARK's off in the kitchen. 
MARK (OS) Here you go. A beer comes flying out of the kitchen and SEAN catches it. 
MARK (OS) (CONT'D) Sharon. Another beer comes flying out which SHARON had no idea was coming and so it smashes into the fireplace. 
SHARON Oh God. I'm so sorry. And a brick comes down the chimney and crashes on top of the broken glass from the beer bottle. 
DUSTIN You know, ironically, we're paying an extra 50 bucks a month 'cause it has a working fireplace. 
SEAN This house is great. The team is great. It's exactly what it should be. 
(TO ANDREW) I'm Sean Parker. MARK comes out of the kitchen--

EXT. RUBY SKYE - NIGHT 
An ultra-hip San Prancisco nightclub where a line of well- dressed young people stretches from the clipboard holding BOUNCER down the block. The BOUNCER motions to three SEXY GIRLS who are let in through the velvet rope. If this reminds us of the scene at the final club party at the beginning of this story than that's fine. The three SEXY GIRLS take us into 
INT. RUBY SKYE - CONTINUOUS 
It's a hundred-year old theater that's been converted into a 21st Century hot spot for Silicon Valley's rock stars. The lower level is a giant dance floor packed"with sweating 20- somethings bouncing to pounding house music. There are raised blocks where scantily dressed professional. dancers perform non- stop. A huge lighting grid hangs from the ceiling shooting colored lights and lasers everywhere. Also hanging from the ceiling are two trapeze bars with two performers swinging and contorting. 
A WAITRESS holding a tray of colored drinks high over her head takes us through the crowd to a spiral staircase that's being guarded by two more BOUNCERS with clipboards. The staircase leads up to the 2nd level which is all VIP tables that look out over the dance floor. Each VIP area has a couple of couches and a table covered in bottles of vodka, tequila, rum, mixers, ice, glasses and a private waitress who's happy to bend over and pour a drink for you, And that's where we catch up with MARK and SEAN. Sitting next to SEAN is a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN and there's another standing behind him and leaning against the couch. MARK and SEAN have to speak the music. 
MARK I still can't believe I rented a house across the street from you. 
SEAN That's not my house. It was Sharon's. I was crashing there for a little. bit while I'm taking care of some things. But she's done for the summer so she's back at her parents' place and I'm homeless. 
NARK Yeah?

SEAN No man. I'll tell you something, you know how I founded Napster? 
MARK I know everything there is to know about you Sean. 
SEAN Fuck Wikipedia, Mark, no you don't. 
(BEAT) I was going out with this girl in high school. And it was great. I thought it was great, but the whole time--almost the .whole time we were together., like five months--she was giving blow. jobs to the co-captain of the lacrosse team. And I found out and I was willing to forgive her but she told me she loved him. So I had this dream that I would make a billion dollar company.. Not a million dollar company--any hack can do that---a billion dollar company. And I would have business cards printed up that said, "I'm CEO.. .Bitch. " 
(BEAT) It's our time. We run the universe. Yeah, she's a Victoria's Secret model. I want to know where the fuck Eduardo is. 
MARK He has an internship.

RACE FILM-- 
TYLER (CONT'D) Turn it off. 
(PAUSE) Turn it off, Cam. Look at me. CAMERON turns to his brother... 
TYLER (CONT'D) I don't mind that we got beat by the Dutch by less than a second. That was a fair race, that was a good race and they had the better boat today and they'll see us again. What I mind is that we got beat by Mark Zuckerberg...by less than a second. 
(BEAT) We tried the Ad Board, we tried the president of the University and we tried talking to him ourselves. Now I'm asking you. For the one-hundreth time. Let's take the considerable-resources at our disposal and sue him in a federal. court. CAMERON looks at his brother...then turns back to the computer. He watches the Dutch boat pull ahead at the last moment. TYLER and DIVYA are just about to give up when CAMERON swings back and says-- 
CAMERON Let's fucking gut that little nerd.

SEAN is pacing the house on his cell phone while two YOUNG WOMEN--dressed to go out for a party--are at the moment each on a free computer playing each other in a game of Counter- Strike. Basically they're shooting at each other and missing and laughing their heads off, it wouldn't appear as if the house has been cleaned since the last time we saw it and in fact there are signs of more wreckage as well as futons, pillows and blankets on the floor.

EDUARDO What in hell happened here? 
SEAN Not happened--happening. The next big thing.

EDUARDO Hey man. 
SEAN

EDUARDO Flow old are they, Sean?

A summer sub-let. A studio apartment the size of a small too]. shed. EDUARDO is asleep on top of the covers in the un-air conditioned apartment when he wakes up to the sound of a key in the door; One lock un-locks, then another-- 
EDUARDO Hello? --and then the last. The door opens and JENNY is framed by the dingy light of the hallway.

EDUARDO I brought you a present. 
JENNY Why does your status say "single" on your Facebook page? 
EDUARDO

JENNY What?! 
EDUARDO I don't know how. 
JENNY Do I look stupid to you? 
EDUARDO No. Calm down. 
JENNY You're asking me to believe that the CFO of Facebook doesn't know how to-change his relationship status on Facebook? 
EDUARDO It's a little embarrassing so you should take it as a sign of trust that I would tell you that. 
JENNY Puck you, Wardo. 
EDUARDO 
(CALMING) Easy. 
JENNY You didn't change it so you could fuck Silicon valley skanks every time you go out to see Mark. 
EDUARDO That is not even remotely true and I can promise you that the Silicon valley skanks don't care what anyone's relationship status is on Facebook. Please let me give you your present. EDUARDO's cell phone RINGS--

EDUARDO Okay, this is gonna be tricky. Here, open your present. It's a silk scarf. 
JENNY Have you ever seen me wear a scarf?

CUT TO 
INT. NEW FACEBOOE OFFICES - NIGHT 
EDUARDO (V.O.) I went out to California and went straight to the new offices. And it's clear that we're in the offices of a new, high-tech, very successful internet company. The Facebook logo in blue metallic letters on the wall, the maple desks, new computer monitors, carpeting, a wall covered in graffiti by an artist commissioned for. the job and -tons of young employees. 
EDUARDO (V.0.) (CONT'D) I didn't know whether to dress for the party or the business meeting so I kind of dressed for both. We see that most of the employees, especially the women, are dressed to go to an after-work, late-night party. 
EDUARDO (V.0.) (CONT'D) But it didn't matter.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -CONTINUOUS 
EDUARDO (V.0.) At first I thought he was joking, giving me more contracts to sign. But then I started reading. As EDUARDO reads, we rack focus to MARK, who's sitting at a computer'with his back to EDUARDO, focused on his work. And then we see-SEAN step into the frame and lean against a desk a few yards away. And then back to EDUARDO, who's almost shaking...

SEAN Yes. EDUARDO picks up MARK's laptop over his head and smashes it down on the desk, breaking it into pieces. 
EDUAK2DO How 'bout now, are you still wired in? 
SEAN (to the girl at the desk he's

INT. SORORITY HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's dark but we can make out people dancing. The place is packed. 
UT TO 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
We hear the thumping music from the party. SEAN's in there with a couple of guys, ASHLEIGH and another GIRL. SEAN's got his cell phone out and will snap a picture every once in a while. 
GIRL I can't find a mirror. 
GUY Do it on anything. You can use a CD. 
ASHLEIGH Do it off this. ASHLEIGH's sat on the bed and unbuttoned her top so that she's in just a bra. She's offering her chest as a surface off of which to snort cocaine. 
GIRL Alright! The GIRL taps out some coke from a vial onto ASHLEIGH's chest and starts passing around a rolled up 20-dollar bill for everyone to have a turn and she herself will unbutton her shirt too for the same purpose. All this while SEAN is talking, 
SEAN The next transformative development? A picture sharing application. A place where you view pictures that coincide with your social life. It is the true... digitalization of real life. You don't just go to a party anymore, you go to a party with your digital camera and your friends relive the party on Facebook. And tagging. The idea that you could tag anyone you wanted in those pictures so that people could find themselves. Then a digital log of every change in a person's life, broadcast to all their friends instantaneously. 
ASHLEIGH Would this be easier without the bra? 
GUY It's worth finding out. The girls start happily slipping off their bras-- 
.SEAN I've spent hours-- 
ASHLEIGH Why has the music stopped? 
SEAN I've spent hours watching what people do when they log on. 
ASHLEIGH Seriously, why has the music stopped? ASHLEIGH has a point. The music stopped in the addle of SEAN's speech and the sound outside from the party just doesn't sound like a party anymore. 
SEAN flow they always checked their friends' status updates, checked to see which of their friends had changed their profiles, changed their photos and mostly...We lived on farms, then we lived in cities and now we're gonna live on the internet. 
- ASHLEIGH Sean. Stop. Something's going on downstairs, SEAN stops talking-he senses it too now. SEAN walks out of the room to the-- 
INT, STAIRCASE LANDING - CONTINUOUS And out the window he sees a fleet of police cars with their lights flashing parked in front of the house. Then before he can react, the front door flies open-- POLICE with flashlights walk in--the beams of light streaking across the darkened party floor and the faces.. We HEAR muffled murmurs from the cops of "party's over" and "step to the side" and "nobody's leaving just yet", etc. SEAN bolts back into-- 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
--leaving the door open. 
SEAN It's the cops. And they all spring into action. The girls are putting their bras back on, SEAN is wiping down a night table with the palm of his hand to get the coke dust off. 
SEAN (CONT'D) 
POLICEMAN What's goin' on? They turn to see TWO POLICEMEN standing in the doorway, their flashlights scanning the room and hitting SEAN's eyes. 
SEAN 
(BEAT) We're sorry, was the music too loud? We've got kind of a celebration going. 
POLICEMAN Ladies, I need you to put your shirts on. 
SEAN I can have them turn the music down. One of the policemen casually takes SEAN's hand and sees that his palm looks like he just used it to erase a blackboard. The cop uses his finger to taste what it is. 
SEAN (CONT'D) Yeah, that isn't mine. 
POLICEMAN Okay, could you all stay where you are. And the handcuffs start to come out and we've got a room of terrified children. 
GIRL, Wait, can we just talk for a second? We start to move in on SEAM... 
POLICEMAN 
(TO SEAN) You got anything in your pockets I need to know about? 
SEAN No sir. 
- POLICEMAN Don't be stupid now, 
SEAN I don It. 
POLICEMAN (out of SEAN's shirt pocket) What's this? 
SEAN It's an Epipen, 
POLICEMAN And this? 
SEAN That's my inhaler.

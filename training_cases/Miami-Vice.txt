FADE IN: 
FADE IN: 
EXT. OCEAN - CLOSE UP:  WATER - MORNING LIGHT 
We are at the delicate interface between ocean and air...liquid and gas...the event horizon where molecules evaporate.  This interchange is ethereal.  Then, low frequencies rumble through depths...louder...closer, now... And the ocean surface is torn by a 46-foot catamaran and the ROAR of 2,700 horsepower, rocketing at us at 140 knots... 
OFFSHORE RACER:  "BORN TO WIN" 
in PROFILE. 
AERIAL:  "BORN TO WIN" 
...has a canopy, low like a B-1 bomber and extends a half mile.  It launches off two-foot swells, goes airborne, pushes to 150 knots with another 1,100 RPM left... 
INT. RACE BOAT - SONNY CROCKETT 
pilots the "Born to Win" in full helmet.  On the throttle and flaps is RICARDO TUBBS... 
EXT. OCEAN - "BORN TO WIN" 
leads the frontrunners towards a finish line demarcated by a couple of $10 million yachts loaded with media.  At the last moment occurs a small power loss, and "Born to Win" gets nosed into second place by the 46-foot Skater, "Goddess"... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MARINA - "BORN TO WIN" - LATER 
thunders to the dock, throttled down at low revs.  The canopy is up.  Crockett and Tubbs' helmets are off.  Dockhands tie it off.  It's the same crowd you catch at a Grand Prix:  nine- figure money, tall, Northern Italian women and minor German princesses with Swiss educations, no bimbos and no questions about asset origins.  The exception is "Born to Win's" sponsor, a blonde, dreadlocked, bearded 6'4" SWITEK.  He looks like a dot-com entrepreneur who got out in time.  Next to him is a blonde Ukranian lady with high cheekbones.  We'll see her again. 
WINNING CIRCLE - CROCKETT + TUBBS 
in second position to the Japanese driver and throttle man of "Goddess," neither of whom speak English.  The #3 boat, "Bicardi Silver," was driven by David Scott and throttled by John Tomlinson... 
CROCKETT + TUBBS 
leave the winning circle among Asian and Mexican billionaires.  As the small crowd breaks up... 
A DEEPLY-TANNED PLAYER 
named NICHOLAS in Vuarnet wraparounds and buzz-cut white hair glides by... 
NICHOLAS (low) Burnett, what's crackin'? 
CROCKETT Nothing. 
TUBBS Maxin' and relaxin'. 
NICHOLAS (doesn't believe them) Sure.  Change your mind; get inclined?  Let me know... 
Whatever Nicholas is soliciting, Crockett and Tubbs don't want.  (Nicholas brokers "go-fast" runs, moving loads from offshore into South Florida.  Among guys who pilot offshore race boats, there are one or two who've never run a load, but no one's found them yet.)  Meanwhile... 
CUT TO: 
INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - A KITCHEN - NIGHT 
A couple-hundred-thousand-dollars worth of granite and steel. Off-screen a restaurant-grade Sub-Zero opens with a hiss. Fan starts.  Beyond the kitchen we SEE through a dining room to a den.  A chair is overturned.  We HEAR muffled sounds. We SEE feet extend through a door jamb.  Someone's on the floor.  A television is playing, distantly. 
INT. DEN - SEE FAMILY PICTURES 
so close they almost come to life.  A Venezuelan family, two boys and a girl in a pool.  Maria, Alonzo, the two boys at their sister's baptism.  And we see holding the baby daughter is Riccardo Tubbs. 
A family dinner at a South American restaurant.  Tubbs sits with the youngest daughter on his lap.  Maria is on the other side of him.  This is the image that almost comes to life. We hear the vivacious latin ambience late on a Sunday afternoon when families take the grandparents and have dinner. 
enter an 8,000-square-foot penthouse...offshore racer types, players, So Bee models... 
UGO Runnin' the Biscayne 200? 
Crockett wanders off... 
TUBBS If a coupla new exhaust manifolds show up... 
CROCKETT 
approaches a bar and female bartender... 
CROCKETT Gin and Tonic.  Plymouth or Boodles. 
BARTENDER (Scandinavian accent) Lemon or lime? 
CROCKETT Lemon doesn't go in Gin and Tonics, darlin'.  Where ya' from? 
BARTENDER (leaning in) Gottingen.  That's in Sweden. 
CROCKETT You in Miami workin' on your complexion...? 
She's beautifully bronzed. 
BARTENDER (laughs) No.  I was in Namibia... 
CROCKETT Doing...? 
BARTENDER With the United Nations High Commission on Refugees.  Famine relief. 
Gina's listening on her personal comms. 
CROCKETT Really?  I did refugee relocation in Somalia.  But they transferred me out after I was wounded... 
Gina rolls her eyes as she crosses by Tubbs. 
GINA Only African he ever "relocated" was a $2,000-an-hour Nigerian model for Gucci, and he got wounded when she took an NBA draft choice to the Super Bowl instead of him... 
TUBBS He did volunteer one time... 
TRUDY (entering) For a massage parlor bust? (beat) Why am I here...? 
TRUDY JOPLIN is a tall African-American.  She whispers into a small mic.  If you looked closely, she's ripped...as if steel cables moved under her smooth skin.  She slides past Tubbs and Gina... 
TUBBS (low) ...to backup Switek.  But only if it gets lethal. 
TRUDY That's impossible. 
TUBBS Why? 
TRUDY Because you cannot kill him. 
SWITEK 
all white bling, is arguing with his blade-thin, glassy-eyed, adrenaline junkie partner, ZITO.  Approaching is "Miss Ukraine."  High cheekbones suggest one of Genghis Khan's horsemen found her maternal ancestor as attractive as Switek finds her... 
Tubbs clocks three beefy Russians in a corner, one is unusually fit. 
TUBBS And there's Dmitri... 
CROCKETT The honey trap.  And there's the honey. 
TUBBS Hello, Miss Ukraine... 
MISS UKRAINE brings Switek his glass of champagne...  She whispers something in his ear...and is led towards a back bedroom.  Gina ambles over. 
TRUDY (to Crockett) Eleven to seven he blows it. 
CROCKETT (whispers) Twenty on my man... 
TRUDY You're giving away your money, fool... 
Tubbs opens his Moto as if he's about to make a call...Trudy looks over his shoulder.  What we see is the feed from the monitor in the surveillance room downstairs. 
CLOSER: TUBBS'S MOTO 
Two blonde people starting to get naked.  Switek and Miss Ukraine.  A second call comes in.  Tubbs ignores it. 
WIDEN.  Everybody goes back to their cars.  As the two "Russians" get into theirs, Aryan Brother #1 turns from the running board of the Escalade with his driver's door open. 
ARYAN BROTHER Hey, Ivan!  I forgot to ask you something, my brother... 
He looks at his partner and nods, who says something into a Nextel. 
ARYAN BROTHER (cont'd) ...they have a decent death-benefit program in the FBI? 
For the Russians in the car, time freezes.  As they start to react, they're blown up by .50 caliber rounds from the two sniper positions.  The .50 caliber rounds go right through car bodies, sheet metal, upholstery, glass, human flesh, bone, more upholstery and metal and out the other end. Another round goes through the passenger door, through the passenger, through the driver, out the driver door and into the night... 
WIDE 
The three Aryan Brothers approach the steaming cars with the chopped-up occupants and take the gym bag full of cash.  The Escalade driver dons night-vision goggles.  They load up and drive off as we hear the "thump, thump" of Air Support and some distant sirens.  Meanwhile... 
CUT TO: 
INT. MIAMI-DADE CHOPPER - SWITEK + ZITO - NIGHT 
at 170 knots watching a thermographic image of Alonzo Stevens' car on a monitor weave through traffic northbound on the 95...  SEE Tubbs' Sikorsky beyond Switek + Zito as it swoops from a higher altitude right past the Miami-Dade chopper, banks and dives for the freeway. 
EXT. FREEWAY 
Tracking with Stevens' Bentley from the front. 
The black Sikorsky is almost on the Bentley's hood.  Tubbs racks the chopper sideways so that Alonzo can see Crockett in the copilot seat... 
CLOSER:  CROCKETT 
has his handgun out and is waving Alonzo over to the shoulder.  Tubbs keeps the chopper almost blocking Alonzo's Bentley.  Alonzo pulls over.  Tubbs wheels around and lands on the shoulder.  They approach... 
ALONZO STEVENS 
exits the Bentley and walks toward Crockett and Tubbs.  He holds his hand out to keep them at a distance. 
Freeway traffic roars past.  Crockett and Tubbs don't get too close, heeding Alonzo's warning... 
TUBBS (incensed, over traffic noise) What the hell did you do? 
STEVENS The Feeb gig was I front a coupla undercover, Russian-speakers to them.  One's ATF.  And broker the deal.  Set up the meet with the NLR types... 
Stevens takes a low-resolution E-mailed image from his pocket and hands it to Tubbs.  Tubbs looks up, shocked, hands it to Crockett.  Stevens' head rotates loosely on his shoulders...his mind's elsewhere... 
CROCKETT'S POV:  IMAGE 
Alonzo's wife, Francine, is bound - clothes torn - to a chair in a TV room.  On the floor are two young boys bound with plastic ties.  Paper bags are over their heads.  Francine's eyes are as large as saucers.  Around her neck is a necklace of C-4 explosive connected to a detonator. 
STEVENS (cont'd) (shouts) So I gave them up, man!  Gave up the Feds!  Gave up everything I knew.  Now I got to go home... 
CROCKETT How'd they get onto you? 
STEVENS How do I know?  But it was from the get-go.  Knew the FBI had run me into them. (beat) Sonny, I gotta go...! 
MEANWHILE: 
INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - TRUDY - NIGHT 
and a Miami PD SWAT team crash through the front door. Another team through the back.  Trudy in a tactical vest is second in with a 12-gauge.  The house is empty.  Gina and other detectives hang in the rear.  First SWAT team "clears" the living room, dining room.  Second clears the kitchen, maid's quarters... 
INT. ALONZO STEVENS' HOUSE - DOOR TO DEN - NIGHT 
...last room to clear...center of the house.  SWAT teams appear around corners.  Weapons up.  The looks on their faces tell us nobody is here...nobody alive...and what they see gives even these veterans pause as blood pools around the legs of a family and overturned chairs.  Alonzo didn't save anyone. 
TRUDY (after changing channel) Hello, Sonny...? 
EXT. FREEWAY - TUBBS 
on police radio listens to a message from Trudy while... 
STEVENS (to Tubbs) I gotta, I gotta go...! 
TUBBS Alonzo... 
STEVENS What...? 
TUBBS (voice cracks) Alonzo, you don't need to go home. 
Now Alonzo knows. 
FUJIMA Get into business with this crew, identify them.  Illuminate their network.  If you're lucky, discover their source, how they penetrated us.  We'll indict and take it from there... 
CROCKETT How do we do that?  Make a buy? (wry) That went well... 
TUBBS Reverse undercover?  WE supply to them? 
FUJIMA They got a steady stream of supply. So, no... 
CROCKETT From whom...? 
FUJIMA A Colombian producer.  Named Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono. 
CROCKETT Never heard of him. 
FUJIMA From the North Valle area.  New. Low-level, we think. 
TUBBS Aryan brothers are not going to change-up suppliers.  So... 
CROCKETT Transpo?  How they bringing the loads in...? 
FUJIMA They're not.  They collect in Miami.  Montoya, the producer, handles deliveries.  That's his end, and he varies the routes.  We got some FLIR off an AWAC of a coupla go-fast boats, on one run, that's all. 
Fujima boots up his military-spec laptop to view the FLIR video.  Meanwhile... 
TUBBS Track with me, here... (beat) They knew the "Russians" were undercover Feeb?  They should have no-showed.  But, no, these guys show anyway, and commit murder upon federal officers.  And steal all your money... (beat; to Fujima) What does that say to you? 
CROCKETT (speculating) It says, "We do not fear you." (to Fujima) It says, "Fuck off and die."  It says, "We get down for recreation..." 
Fujima's Dell laptop glows to life.  Two almost indistinguishable boats and their wakes are SEEN. 
CROCKETT (cont'd) Blow that up... 
Crockett's attention goes to something atypical he spots about the wake emerging behind each boat.  He exchanges a look with Tubbs.  But they say nothing. 
TUBBS (to Crockett) So? 
CROCKETT We could try to run loads into these guys. (to Fujima) Run a few loads for Montoya into South Florida.  Into this group. 
FUJIMA You need to consider a few issues. 
CASTILLO (to Crockett + Tubbs) ...you'd be operating outside territorial United States.  Your badges do not count.  You have no authorization to carry weapons.  If you're busted, it could take a long time to get you re-patriated.  And there's no backup... (to Fujima) And you will share with them all your intel on Montoya... 
FUJIMA Sure. 
CASTILLO I mean full disclosure. 
FUJIMA Of course.  From my side, I don't WANT to know anything about what you're doing or how you do it... (to Castillo) So let me know if we're on... 
Fujima splits.  Castillo waits until Fujima's car pulls away. 
CASTILLO (to Tubbs) About the Stevens family, I'm sorry.  I know you were close to them. 
TUBBS I was the kids' godfather. 
CASTILLO (intuits) And...? 
TUBBS "And" what? 
CASTILLO I got to know.  There is never any room for "personal"... 
CROCKETT (for Tubbs) He is fine.  And we know the jokes. When it gets vengeful, things get messy.  When they get messy the wrong people die... (beat) Everybody gets it. 
CASTILLO Good. 
TUBBS And the answer is "yes." (beat) Before she met Alonzo, once upon a time, a long time ago. (beat) You bet it was personal. 
...and is now compartmentalized in the past. 
CASTILLO Okay. (to Crockett) What'd you spot...? 
CROCKETT Three wakes off the back of those boats.  Who runs three Sterling engines off a deep-V hull? 
TUBBS Sal Maguda. 
CASTILLO He any good? 
TUBBS Oh, yeah... 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LA PERLA DISTRICT OF SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO - TWILIGHT 
Corrosion and decay.  People look coldly at us.  Malevolence and malefaction on every corner.  No one's picked up the garbage for a month.  Poverty in the Caribbean half-light... 
CROCKETT & TUBBS 
cross the street to CAMERA from their rental car.  The La Perla section was a 16th Century haven for pirates.  It's had little civic improvements in 400 years. 
They enter a nightclub - shabby neon. 
INT. NIGHTCLUB - CROCKETT + TUBBS - TWILIGHT 
There are no customers.  They're cautious.  Men stop them and frisk them.  They expected that. 
CROCKETT We're from Nicholas to meet José... 
They're waved to the rear.  They start towards a back table. A small group of people wait... 
OVER CROCKETT + TUBBS APPROACHING:  JOSÉ "COCHI LOCO" YERO 
He's a former right-wing Colombian paramilitary from the North Valle near the Pacific coast.  He runs operations, communications and security.  He has cold eyes and a corpulent face.  He's notorious for using torture to ferret-out informants.  Right now he watches these two Americans approach.  Security people are on either side of him. 
JOSÉ YERO (extends hand) José... 
CROCKETT Sonny Burnett...this is my partner, Rico. 
JOSÉ YERO Sit. 
As Crockett sits, he notices that at a table a few to the side is a woman.  This is ISABELLA.  Behind glasses, she seems immobile, filled with intelligence, well-dressed in subdued Tom Ford and staring at him.  Reading him.  Crockett holds the look that extra beat and turns back to business... 
CROCKETT (to Security) Dos café. 
He's security, not a fucking waiter.  But Yero nods. Security fetches coffee, anyway. 
TUBBS So lay it out, my brother... 
JOSÉ YERO Nicholas said you okay.  That's nice.  But how I know if you any good? 
CROCKETT What...? 
JOSÉ YERO Who you run loads for?  Cause other than Nicholas, you knows you? 
Tubbs looks at Crockett.  They thought it was a done deal. 
CROCKETT (dark) My mommy and daddy know me. 
Isabella tilts her head imperceptibly. 
TUBBS And we didn't come down here to audition.  Business auditions for us... (beat) ...and know who we are and know they want their load run by us before Nicholas calls. 
CROCKETT That way we do not waste AvGas or our motherfucking time. 
Yero's security reacts to the tone and raises weapons.  A few start up out of their chair as... 
ZITO + SWITEK 
appear at the door, SMGs from shoulder straps.  Zito flips a D14 hand grenade which Crockett snatches out of the air, pulls the pin and slams on the table.  Everyone FREEZES. 
Only Crockett's hand pressure restrains the clip. 
CROCKETT (cont'd) (goes right up in Yero's face) You want to "know" shit?  Who the fuck are you?  You got a side deal with U.S. Customs to open up the coast in a few spots...in exchange you flip them some gringo runners? Like us...? 
TUBBS You wearing a wire? 
Tubbs rips open Yero's shirt. 
CROCKETT Or DEA?  The Feeb? 
Yero's shirt...open to the waist.  No wire.  Yero's furious. 
Yero's people have weapons pointed their way.  They outnumber Switek and Zito.  Slack's taken up on triggers.  It's on the edge.  And the edge is overloaded.  Tubbs reads that, warns Yero... 
TUBBS People gonna walk into this place and say, "Ola, hijo!  That some crazy wallpaper.  Whew...it wild! Is that a Jackson Pollack?" 
CROCKETT "No, viejo.  That was José Yero, splattered all over his motherfucking wall." 
Tubbs and Gina are not random lovers, they're in love.  The look in her eyes, the openness is pure femininity behind the Bronx presentation.  She smiles, touches the side of his face. 
EXT. SAFE HOUSE, ON THE INDIAN RIVER - CROCKETT - NIGHT 
ties up a 75' Sun Seeker.  It looks like a 38' deep-V offshore racer on growth hormones.  Crockett's alone, as dusk fades over the '60's ranch house on the river.  It's under tropical trees, with one strip of white neon utility lighting outlining the flat eave. 
INT. SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - CROCKETT 
let himself in.  He's at a kitchen stool at the counter when Tubbs enters in sweats. 
TUBBS Anything? 
CROCKETT Nothing. 
Gina enters in a robe... 
GINA (beat) "Hi, Gina.  Hi, Sonny." 
CROCKETT Hi, Gina. (putting shopping bag on table) This is from Frick and Frack. Trudy? 
TUBBS (re:  bag) What do we got? 
Crockett pulls out three overly-large cell phones... 
CROCKETT Satellite.  New encryption. Supposedly sharper than the G... (to Gina) How good's our background? 
Tubbs and Crockett look at the Mac screen as Gina boots it up.  Gina's fingers tap dance on the keyboard. 
GINA You're so not the PD, if you got busted on a DUI, you're in serious trouble...you're bad men back to grammar school. (to Tubbs) San Quentin.  Pelican Bay. (to Crockett) Marine Corps.  Statesville. Pelican Bay, where you guys hooked up.  Now you're too smart and too fast to get jacked again... 
CROCKETT How will it stand up? 
GINA If they ran the rental car or lease on this place...even if it's EPIC database in El Paso...they'd have to work through the layers of bullshit three weeks deep.  Then they'd find your deeper, hidden criminal selves... 
INT. LIVING ROOM - BAD 3 AM TELEVISION - LATER 
No one's watching it. 
INT. BEDROOM - GINA 
asleep.  Tubbs' eyes are wide open, staring... 
INT. SECOND BEDROOM - ECU:  PAGER 
lights up.  Beeps.  Crockett's hand grabs it.  It's the summons from José Yero. 
INT. KITCHEN - GINA - PRE-DAWN 
GINA (Lazily) What am I supposed to do after I get my nails and hair done...? 
TUBBS Reality TV and stay by the phone. That's what all wives-in-crime do... 
He leans over and kisses her.  She holds firmly the back of his neck and looks into his eyes. 
GINA Be...careful...  You hear me? 
He winks at her in assurance and he's gone.  Her lazy smile drops off.  "Careful"...she's not so sure he will be... 
CUT TO: 
INT. LEAR 55 JET - TUBBS PILOTS 
Crockett in the copilot seat.  Switek and Zito are in the back, barely awake.  Zito hands out coffee.  Switek's stashing weapons behind the fuselage upholstery.  Tubbs is clearing US air space as we... 
EXT. SKY - AERIAL:  LEAR JET 
rockets through cumulonimbus against a black sky up to 35,000 feet. 
TUBBS Where we meeting 'em...? 
CROCKETT Port-Au-Prince. 
EXT. PORT-AU-PRINCE AIRPORT, RUNWAY - LEAR JET - DAWN 
touches down, drives towards us...  Turns towards commercial aviation facility... 
CLOSER:  HATCH 
holds his. 
CROCKETT 
Sound deadens.  His attention is on the woman in the mirror...until it's broken by Tubbs' attention to his cell phone. 
TUBBS' CELL PHONE 
Signal strength returns.  Tubbs punches in numbers. 
TUBBS (low) ...who did we just meet? 
He waits.  A phone rings.  It's picked up by Gina. 
GINA (O.S.) Hello...? 
Tubbs is relieved... 
TUBBS You okay? 
GINA Yeah. 
TUBBS You sure? 
GINA Yes.  What's up? 
TUBBS Nothing.  Calling to say hi... What's up with you? 
INTERCUT WITH: 
INT. SAFE HOUSE, KITCHEN - GINA 
GINA Bored. 
To Tubbs, that's good news. 
TUBBS Okay...see you soon. 
GINA ...and thanks for the flowers. 
EXT. HAITIAN TOWN SQUARE - TUBBS 
TUBBS What flowers? 
GINA The bouquet, here.  Five-hundred dollars worth of roses...yellow. 
Pause. 
TUBBS There a note? 
Pause. 
GINA You mean with the flowers...? 
TUBBS What's it say? 
GINA "Salutations from the south..." 
A deep chill. 
GINA (cont'd) I...I thought it was from you. 
And, now, she gets it.  Gina is in the kitchen.  Alone, in their secret safe-house location.  She and Tubbs have nothing to say.  He looks to Crockett.  The message from Montoya- Londono is clear:  I know you.  I can reach out and locate you our yours.  Anytime.  YOU ARE NOT SAFE. 
TUBBS We're on our way... 
INT. KITCHEN - GINA - NIGHT 
TUBBS (O.S.) (forced casual) So why don't you...meet the plane... 
We sense this is code.  It means get the fuck out of there right now! 
GINA (cool) Okay. 
TUBBS Good idea. (beat) We'll grab a bite. 
Gina ends the call, drops to the floor to the wall, kills the lights, holds her Sig .9mm at her side as she moves deeper into the interior... 
ZITO (V.O.) Roger that. 
INT. A-500 - CROCKETT - MUCH LATER 
is dozing.  A signal. 
Tubbs points up and to the right.  Crockett wakes, looks.  An Aero Commander Turbo Twin is paralleling the A-500's course. Now, it slides over them...almost into a collision.  It sits right over the A-500, separated by only 75 feet. 
INT. OPA-LOCKA AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL - TRAFFIC CONTROLLER - DAY 
handling a myriad of flights, reacts.  On his radar he sees next to the image of the Aero Commander, a ghost image.... 
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER Eleven-ten, Sierra, do you have a visual on another aircraft...? 
INT. AERO COMMANDER - SWITEK + ZITO - DAY 
Switek is flying and looks down at the A-500 below... 
ZITO Negative, Opa-Locka. 
INT. OPA-LOCKA AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL - TRAFFIC CONTROLLER 
keys his radio. 
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER Opa-Locka Air Traffic Control to JIT 0-seven-six-Nellie-Charlie... 
AWAC (V.O.) Hello, Opa-Locka.  What's up? 
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER I've got an Aero Commander coming in on a two-seventy-nine heading, but I had a double image...like there's another plane there, now I'm only picking up on one.  What do you read? 
INT. US CUSTOMS AWAC - RADAR OFFICER 
RADAR OFFICER Let me see... 
His FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared) picks up Switek and Zito's Air Commander.  He flips through all the different modalities of detection, including thermography, for anything else suspicious in the airspace... 
AWAC RADAR OFFICER (into mic) Too many Mai Tais at lunch... You're seeing double.  One blip. One plane. 
EXT. SKY - SIDE SHOT:  THE AERO COMMANDER LIKE A PANCAKE ON TOP OF THE A-500 RIGHT BELOW IT 
We get the joke.  The A-500 with its stealthiness under the Aero Commander together like a single footprint. 
AERIAL ANGLE:  TWO PLANES 
piggybacked, enter US airspace and cross the coastline into Florida. 
From underneath, the Aero Commander sweeps to the right on approach as Tubbs radically dives for the trees, hugging the contour at 220 knots at 150 feet...having snuck this plane and its load into the United States of America. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CIRCLE 6 MOTEL, PARKING LOT - U-HAUL-IT TRUCK - NIGHT 
Alone in the acid-yellow glare of the sodium vapor lights. We wait.  We don't know why we're here. 
PARKING LOT PERIMETER - SAWGRASS 
MOVE IN...and we REVEAL staked-out are Crockett, Jean-Louis and Tubbs... 
CROCKETT Neptune gonna show? 
We don't know who he's talking about. 
JEAN-LOUIS Oh, he'll show.  This is his kind of deal.  Crime on crime.  Who's gonna call the cops? 
CROCKETT (skeptical) Usually his thing is street dealers.  Torture their families until they cough up the stash. This...? 
JEAN-LOUIS He's ambitious. 
TUBBS Heads up... 
ESCALADE 
Lights off.  Cruises through the parking lot past the U-Haul- It to the other side and disappears. 
TUBBS (cont'd) That's slick:  Neptune's Escalade's worth more than the real estate. But no one's supposed to notice his drive-by? 
CROCKETT Here's another incognito genius... 
The empty mansion is on its own peninsula.  Through the windows we see a yacht and Crockett's 48' Stryker, its canopy open but without its racing supergraphics.  The mansion interior...all Beaumaniers limestone...is devoid of all furnishing.  They sit on white plastic garden chairs from Sears. 
JOSÉ YERO (suspicious) I walk into Neptune's house...very nice.  But I also see you... and our drugs that got ripped from Maguda. 
TUBBS You don't like us finding your load?  We can go and lose it all over again... 
CROCKETT How 'bout this?  How'd Neptune know where to hit us?  Huh?  Whose Op sec's got a leak?  Yours? 
JOSÉ YERO What'd Neptune tell you? 
CROCKETT He didn't.  Interrogation's not in our skill set. (beat) So c'mon, what suspicions have you master-minded off these associations? 
JOSÉ YERO (whispers in Spanish to Isabella) Here's what this is...ask how much they want to turn back to us our load... 
Yero's certain about their motive. 
ISABELLA We want it back. 
CROCKETT Okay. 
ISABELLA What's the recovery?  How much are you looking for? 
TUBBS (to Crockett) How much we looking for? 
CROCKETT Nothing. 
ISABELLA What's "nothing"? 
CROCKETT Nothing.  As in "free, gratis." 
TUBBS And as an investment in the future... 
ISABELLA (takes off her glasses and looks at Crockett) "Future" of...? 
CROCKETT A fine...business...relationship... 
She holds Crockett's look...as she did before. 
TUBBS It's yours cause what's yours, is yours.  And what's ours is ours... (to Yero) ...like the second ten-percent, which is now due, Yero, my ace. 
Isabella gestures.  Yero kicks across the floor a cardboard box full of money.  Tubbs glances inside.  Doesn't count it. 
TUBBS (cont'd) What's up next?  Or is this a one- time deal? 
Isabella decides. 
ISABELLA (to Yero) Give them the shipment on the seventeenth... 
Yero doesn't like it.  She gestures "do it." 
TUBBS Conveyance? 
ISABELLA Maritime.  Jose will fill you in. 
And she starts to leave...and sensing Crockett's gotten up and follows her.  Meanwhile 
TUBBS (to Yero) Lay it out... 
And Crockett, close behind Isabella, now... 
CROCKETT (low) There is one thing you can do for me in recognition of the death- defying risks we took to recover your product... 
ISABELLA (low) And what is that? 
This is the wife of narcotrafficker Archangel de Jesus Montoya-Londono. 
CROCKETT Let me buy you a drink. 
Isabella pauses.  Crockett may get killed right now.  They're near the open doors to the patio. 
ISABELLA (low) What do you like to drink? 
CROCKETT (low) I'm a fiend for mojitas. 
Isabella looks over at Crockett's boat.  Back to Crockett... 
ISABELLA (low) How fast does that go? 
ISABELLA I never do business in Cuba. (beat) And nobody goes to Cuba but me. (smiles) And he is not my husband... 
Crockett's surprised.  And he doesn't push it. 
CROCKETT Were you born in Havana? 
ISABELLA Angola.  My mother was being a surgeon there.  She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too... (over the wind) ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world.  She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there... 
CROCKETT Where's she now? 
ISABELLA She's dead... 
Crockett looks at her.  Her perspective is that of the '60's and '70's, the politics of national liberation, the perspective of Marcuse and Franz Fanon. 
CROCKETT Your father? 
ISABELLA Angolan Military.  Went back to the fighting.  Disappeared.  Who knows...? 
Isabella looks at the look on Crockett's face. 
ISABELLA (cont'd) Go ahead and ask... 
CROCKETT How's he not your husband? 
ISABELLA I am no one's wife.  I live in my own house.  I do not live in a man's house.  He has a wife.  We are together.  I am free.  Because of banking and finance and travel... (looks at him, shouts over wind) And I can do anything I want... 
She laughs.  She has that combination of intellect, beauty and youth.  Everything is possible...life will never end...she can ride this crest eternally. 
And Crockett knows that her confidence makes her oblivious to peril, makes "right now" too real because she believes she will live forever. 
CROCKETT 
can't help it.  He looks right at her.  She lifts her face to the spray.  Some clouds part and light strikes her... 
And Crockett wants to possess her; to protect her.  He wants no one else to have her.  He wants no harm to come to her. And this is an impulse that takes him over to the core of who he is.  And, as we MOVE IN CLOSER, Crockett has to turn away... 
ISABELLA 
sees this.  She's quizzical.  Crockett looks back at her. Their eyes connect. 
"BORN TO WIN"

CROCKETT

INT. "JAZZ" - A HAVANA NIGHTCLUB JAMMED WITH PEOPLE - NIGHT 
14-piece Afro-Cuban band.  IN THE PRESS OF dancers at a small table, Crockett and Isabella... 
CROCKETT (shouts over noise) Mojitas...? 
ISABELLA (shouting back) Later!  Do you dance? 
CROCKETT I dance... 
They move into the crowd under two-story high windows overlooking Meyer Lansky's Hotel Riviera - freeze-dried 1959 Las Vegas. 
CROCKETT + ISABELLA 
Whatever we knew about Sonny Crockett, we did not know he could dance.  Their feet, their knees and thighs, perfectly matched, they samba, like lightning. 
He swings her around and turns her to a close embrace as their hips and legs parallel each other's, as he turns her under his arm, stops her, pulls her backwards into his body, her hips into his, the fast beat, the footwork, and he spins her back facing him, pressing her closer as it gets faster and... 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - CROCKETT + ISABELLA 
fall onto a bed, shedding the last of their clothes, making love in a house somewhere.  Beyond them is an open window to the ocean.  The sky turns red and grey but the water stays molten. 
Their eyes are open...because they're locked together the whole time and their faces are steady and urgently surprised because this is not language; not a symbol, not a representation of a thing.  Jesus Montoya is not here.  Miami is not here.  This is discovery.  This is fact.  They have discovered each other and have never felt like this about anyone before in their lives. 
CUT TO: 
CROCKETT (soft) Let's talk deliveries. 
Isabella is not let down by the switch to commerce.  She merely goes there, too.  After all, this is their subject. Soft smiles. 
CROCKETT (cont'd) ...and a different kind of deal. 
ISABELLA Like...? 
CROCKETT Like "three thousand a ki?"  That's nice. And I can supply the transportation into South Florida and the Gulf, more reliable and on-time than FedEx.  But, three per ki was OK for openers. 
ISABELLA And why should continuing excellence cost more? 
CROCKETT Cost less.  That's the point. 
ISABELLA Is it December? 
CROCKETT What do you mean? 
ISABELLA Did Christmas come early this year...? 
CROCKETT Better than that. (beat) We become partners.  Only in this territory and only on loads we run. And you don't pay us three thousand a ki.  You pay us zero.  Why we get is thirty percent of the load. Product or cash.  "And why," you're thinking, "would I be crazy enough to out in these gringos like that? Is he chipping?  Crazy for my love? Too many mojitas?"  And the answer is, "of course" but also "no.  It is because Sonny can deliver what no one else can." 
ISABELLA Good samba dancing...? 
CROCKETT Zero risk. 
ISABELLA 'Cause you don't lose loads? 
CROCKETT 'Cause we guarantee every load. (beat) Anywhere, for any reason, it comes up short, we make good.  Your operations will, from now on, run risk-free. 
ISABELLA And you're our thirty-percent partner? 
Her knowing smile speaks of experience beyond her years. 
ISABELLA (cont'd) (deadly seriously) What if I tell you that your ideas are too big for your skin? (beat) That merely to propose this is a dangerous thing? 
CROCKETT Then I would say to you, this has been fun... 
There's a long pause.  This is business.  This is what is. 
ISABELLA The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it. 
CROCKETT I need thirty.  Calculate in, also, the cash you don't have to front... 
ISABELLA Available cash is not an issue for us... 
CROCKETT Twenty-eight-point-five. 
ISABELLA What if I pushed to twenty-one...? 
CROCKETT I would say you're... (hesitates; holds up four fingers) ...four percentage points away from a deal... 
ISABELLA Maybe I'm only one. 
And she slides into his arms.  And smiles... 
CROCKETT We'll do it at twenty-two... 
Isabella laughs.  She kisses him under the shower water.  And it's tough to know who is pushing it further out onto the edge. 
CROCKETT (cont'd) ...and now what? 
ISABELLA And now I make you breakfast again... 
Her breathing is heavier as she buries her head in his neck.

Rain and wind rip across his face.  He left Isabella in Havana.

CROCKETT Mega-tonnage and mega-cash flow... 
FUJIMA Out of...? 
CROCKETT Haiti and Puerto Rico.  Money through Dubai and Geneva maybe. 
TUBBS Their loads are poly-drug.  "E" from Holland, methamphetamine precursors from Jordan, Afghan "H." Mid-ocean transshipments.  His real business is:  he's a network. 
CROCKETT And we can illuminate part of it from the inside out. 
TUBBS So we want to change-up the mission statement. 
FUJIMA (no) Identify and indict the white supremacist group of importers. End of story.  Everything else I'm hearing is speculation masquerading as intel... 
Crockett flips him a set of keys. 
FUJIMA (cont'd) What's this? 
CROCKETT Keys to the boat.  Go do this motherfucker yourself. 
Fujima looks at Castillo...who is this insubordinate prick? 
FUJIMA Who are you talking to? 
TUBBS He's talking to you, bro. (beat) What he means to say is he is reluctant to abandon the penetration of a major narcotrafficking organization... 
CROCKETT (re: Fujima) Hey, fuck him. 
TUBBS Chill out Sonny. 
CROCKETT We're the ones doing the death- defying shit?  And he wants us to give that up?  For what? A chump-change bust so he can get his picture in The Miami Herald to impress the slug farm in DC... 
FUJIMA (to Castillo) Control your men. 
CROCKETT I'm my own man.  And anytime you want to see how much man I am? 
CASTILLO (low) That's.  It. 
Everybody shuts up. 
CASTILLO (cont'd) (to Tubbs) Where are you on this? 
We know Tubbs has doubts about Crockett's motives and methods, nevertheless... 
TUBBS With Sonny.  110%. 
CASTILLO Then that's it. (to Fujima) Change the mission statement. Crockett stays in.  He keeps working up the ladder.  The local importers get a pass for the time being. 
FUJIMA I don't know. 
CASTILLO Yes you do... 
FUJIMA I got to talk to my ADO... 
CASTILLO No, you don't, Jim. (beat) 'Cause if I close this down, you got nothing to make a phone call about.  And my guys don't have a week for a Feeb bureaucratic process.  Every hour longer they're in there, they risk exposure.  So, right here, right now, they're back in or I pull them out and close you down.  What's it going to be? 
Fujima nods acquiescence. 
FUJIMA Okay. 
He leaves.  When he's out of earshot... 
CASTILLO (to Crockett) You fuckin' better be right...!

TUBBS (low) What is going on...?! 
CROCKETT As in...? 
TUBBS There is "undercover."  And there is "Which way is up?" 
CROCKETT You think I am in so deep I forgot? 
Montoya looks at her very carefully.  She stares right back at him. 
ISABELLA (cont'd) On the other hand...if what you wish, mi corazon, is la plumba...the lead?  Then let's do that.  Accept their deal.  After the load is received...we will close their eyes forever... 
She looks at Montoya squarely.  It hangs in the air.  In his strange process of decision-making, Montoya reaches a conclusion... 
MONTOYA Let's try a few runs with these partners, I think.  I will tell José... 
If Isabella is pleased, she doesn't show it.  Montoya continues to stare at her unwavering expression, frozen in stone.  He smiles, then, and starts to take off her clothes. 
He reaches for her hand and brings her to him.  She kisses him and he puts aside his cigar, pulls her face into his neck, and she runs her hands down him...

CROCKETT 
emerges from behind an SUV.  He came to meet her plane. 
ISABELLA'S 
expression changes, but she masks it. 
Businesslike, she walks across the tarmac.  There are two Suburbans.  One for her; one full of security.  Crockett and her meet.  No show of affection.  Her Secretary, carrying her briefcase, accompanies her towards the second Suburban. 
INT. SECOND SUBURBAN - DOOR - NIGHT 
opens.  Crockett and Isabella climb in.  The rear is customized cream leather, luxurious with three telephones and a divider.  As Isabella climbs in, followed by Crockett, she takes the briefcase from the Secretary and indicates he ride in the front vehicle.  Doors close.  Windows go up.  Air conditioning comes on.  She raises the divider, blocking the driver and locks the doors.  They are sealed in the back. Alone.  And she assaults Crockett with a passion that's desperate...as if making love to him puts her world back in balance.  Their clothes come off, Crockett pauses... 
CROCKETT Hola, chica. 
ISABELLA Hola, viejo. 
He touches the side of her face. 
ISABELLA (CONT'D) Don't stop, bad man... 
As they continue, we...

Yero shakes Gina's hand.  He indicates to the bartender that Tubbs and Gina are to pay for nothing...and he moves towards an office.  Cobalt blue light illuminates his face, and his fierce yellow eyes are not filled with hospitality.

INT. BARRANQUILLA CLUB, OFFICE - JOSÉ YERO 
JOSÉ YERO (in Spanish) They are "wrong."  I do not trust them. 
MONTOYA (V.O.) (in Spanish) Why? 
JOSÉ YERO (in Spanish) Too good at what they do, I don't know.  Something I don't like. They are wrong... 
Montoya thinks. 
EL TIBURON What? 
JOSÉ YERO (goes on) In the '80's, air routes came into favor.  It required many pilots. The best were American.  Former crop-dusters.  They didn't fly by the book.  Tell one:  "Put that 747 down on this fifteen-hundred-foot runway."  Somehow, he'd do it. Great pilots.  But Pablo had a rule.  After they flew six loads...this good pilot who facilitates so much good business... he would come back to Medellín or Barranquilla to pick up the next load? (beat) And no one would ever see him again.  He'd disappear. (imitates Pablo) "You a good pilot? Make a lot of money for Pablo? Thank you very much."  And then Pablo would kill his ass.  After six loads. (pause) And who was Pablo Escobar?  A provincial who got busted-out by the white collars from Cali.  When the gringos got him, he was nobody. We're three times better than Pablo Escobar. (beat) The means we kill these sonsabitches three times sooner. (beat) And do you know why Pablo Escobar did that? 
EL TIBURON Why? 
JOSÉ YERO He didn't like pilots.

ISABELLA I forgot the napkins. 
CROCKETT And the chopsticks and fortune cookies? 
ISABELLA What's the best fortune you ever got? 
CROCKETT They're all the same.  "Financial security is around the corner." "Your friends love you." 
ISABELLA In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust." 
Crockett and Isabella wander down the beach, hard from the ebb tide. 
CROCKETT Do you have assets somewhere else? Bank accounts? 
ISABELLA Why? 
CROCKETT ...to fall back on.  You know, a fail-safe.  Insurance. 
ISABELLA Do I need it? 
CROCKETT (shrugs) Everybody needs it.  Ask Prudential.  Or Allstate. 
ISABELLA (laughs) 'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...? 
The Perseids make the night sky over the water look like the Fourth of July. 
CROCKETT Something like that.  The odds catch up with you.  The odds are like gravity.  You can't negotiate with them. (then) So...at some point, you should cash out, take your money and run... 
ISABELLA (smiles) Really? 
CROCKETT Sure.  As far away and as fast as you can. 
ISABELLA When? 
CROCKETT Whenever.  Maybe later, maybe sooner. 
What is Sonny Crockett trying to say to her? 
ISABELLA Would you find me...? 
CROCKETT Of course. 
ISABELLA Where would I go? 
CROCKETT Zanzibar.  The Comoros Islands. Somewhere in the Indian Ocean. There's twelve-hundred islands there... 
ISABELLA (smiles) Is this the protective male talk? 
CROCKETT (deadly serious) This is the talk of a man...if he were your husband...he would never put you at risk.  He would never put you within a thousand miles of anything that could hurt you. 
ISABELLA And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...? 
CROCKETT A few more moments, still in this business.  Then I'd find you.

CROCKETT They'll have surveillance on us. We'll know only at the last moment... 
CASTILLO What do you think? 
CROCKETT It's a rip and a hit. 
CASTILLO (to someone else) Get me Air Support... (to Crockett) We'll be airborne and assault the ambush...

TUBBS (into phone) Hello...? 
And Tubbs hears..."And weather on the southeast throughout today and looking into the weekend is broken clouds, humidity 78%, small chance of rain.  And coming up in four minutes at 5:45 is Lou Dobbs with Friday's market previews..." 
LOU DOBBS (O.S.) Welcome, folks.  Today's Friday, the three-hundredth-and-fourteenth day of the year...

CASTILLO Safe house is empty... (beat) Air Support's set to jump when we know your drop point.  Gina? 
TUBBS (takes phone) She's sending a message.  Meth Lab. Trailer park.  Anything with interesting antenna arrays...? 
CASTILLO There's three between Miami International and the glades.  I'm gonna try for her, but this is triage.  Protect the maximum number of lives.  You need to know that...

TUBBS HOLD IT!! 
Bulked-out Aryan has a handgun in one hand, detonator in the other.  Eyes wide.  Standoff.  The Old Woman in house dress is SCREAMING...  Her retarded Son sees Tubbs/Gina as a threat to his mother...grabs butcher knife...rushes forward during...

ARYAN BROTHER #3

WIDE - TUBBS 
slips the Autistic Son, rotating his right arm around the kid's right arm, getting slashed on the back of his forearm, but grabbing the Son's wrist as the momentum propels him past Tubbs, who torques the wrist back.  Screaming, Son's ruined wrist, Tubbs took the knife, and as the Aryan Brother swings the bat... 
LOW ANGLE:  TUBBS 
ducks the bat.  It dents the faux-wood paneling.  Tubbs slams the knife twice into the man's slide, doubling him up, leaving the AB Brother to crawl, bleeding, with a 10-inch butcher knife through his kidney into his right lung...  AND Tubbs' gun in his left hand has never moved off-target of the Aryan brother with the detonator in his hand the whole time until right now:  he snaps a ROUND into the wounded Aryan Brother's head.  And, that fast, Tubbs' gun is back on target. 
AND THE FIERCE EYES OF BULKED-OUT BROTHER 
A nihilistic smile dawns there. 
ARYAN BROTHER Shoot me, she dies.  Hey, fuck it, man.  We can all go. 
TRUDY (cool) That's not what will happen. (that stops him) What will happen is... (as she's aiming her Car- 15 and slowly taking up the slack on the trigger...) ...what will happen is, I will put a round precisely through the medula at the base of your brain, at an entry-point mid-distance between your upper lip and the bottom of your nose, and you will be dead from the neck down.  Your finger won't be able to twitch.  Do you believe that? 
ARYAN BROTHER Fuck... 
BLAM.  That's all he gets out.  Trudy does exactly that. Aryan Brother falls like a felled tree.  Tubbs retrieves the detonator.  Trudy unties Gina.  Carefully, Tubbs pulls the sensitive remote detonator from his hands. 
TUBBS 
puts his coat over Gina.  As she half leaves, turns to the fallen AB... 
GINA Motherfucker! 
She kicks him in the head.  Tubbs grabs her to pull her off.

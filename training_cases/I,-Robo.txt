I, ROBOT 
by 
Hillary Seitz 
FADE IN: 
1   On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.                                       1 
A FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely. Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE... 
A SOUND.   Something SHATTERING... 
Then. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We can't quite make out What it's saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we finally. Understand... 
DISEMBODIED VOICE You are in danger... 
CUT TO: 
2   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CLOSE ON                                2 
DEL SPOONER'S FACE.    His eyes, snapping open.   His face, covered in sweat. 
PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly cheerful. 
Spooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream. 
You are in danger... 
He rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy. 
3   INT. SHOWER - MORNING                                              3 
Spooner turns his face into the jet of water. 
4   INT. BATHROOM - MORNING                                            4 
Shaves with a razor.    Using his left hand.   Knicks the cleft of his chin. Shit. 
5   INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                             5 
Stares down at the single egg in a saucepan.      Waiting for it to boil. 
6   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                          6 
Heads down the hallway. Looping a knotted tie around his neck. Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches for the handle. Takes a deep breath and... 
7   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                  7 
...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity. 
Spooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He turns and sees... 
A ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up with a muted WHIR... 
ROBOT (metallic voice) Good day, sir... 
Spooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to lose the robot. 
We now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic. PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings: 
Up high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building cleaning windows. 
A WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently repairs the street. No human supervision. 
A ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk. Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash... 
Humanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners. Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries. Briefcases. 
Stamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE. 
Spooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS. Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing. 
LITTLE GIRL Hi. 
SPOONER Hi. 
But it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.    The robot turns. Looks at the girl. 
ROBOT You are not allowed to talk to strangers. 
Spooner, disgusted.   Has had enough.   He steps off the curb Just as... 
OLD MAN Yes. But you are to say, "No, thank you." 
Spooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his lips, but doesn't take a sip. 
OLD MAN Coffee? 
SPOONER No.    Thank you. 
OLD MAN As you wish. 
The Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee pot. 
SPOONER You want to tell me something about Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death? 
The Old Man smiles. 
OLD MAN I want to tell you that his death was not a suicide. 
SPOONER And why do you say that? 
OLD MAN Why?   Because I want you to know it. 
SPOONER I understand that. But what specifically leads you to believe that he didn't commit suicide? 
OLD MAN (considers) Nothing specifically. 
Spooner shifts his weight.   Agitated. 
SPOONER Under normal circumstances that wouldn't be enough to get you a homicide investigation. 
OLD MAN But this is not "normal circumstances," is it, Detective Spooner? 
SPOONER No.    It isn't. 
OLD MAN Then you will find out who killed Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you will tell me. 
Spooner's losing his patience. 
SPOONER If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll find out. And you'll be the first to know..... 
JUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER. 
15   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                              15 
Spooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT ROBOT. 
ESCORT ROBOT Please follow me. 
Spooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it.     Passes another doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it.     Catches a brief glimpse of... 
DR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY. 
Splayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then continues on. 
16   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY                  16 
Two large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom looking out over the entire complex. 
Spooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically feel the brains and ambition. 
SPOONER Usually I ask who's in charge... 
Spooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON, founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics. 
SPOONER But everyone knows you, Dr. Robertson. 
Robertson smiles.   Pretends to instruct his people. 
ROBERTSON Remind me to cut back on my talk show appearances. 
LAUGHTER. 
ROBERTSON Welcome to U.S. Robotics, Detective. I regret you're not visiting us under more pleasant circumstances. Allow me to introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of Legal Affairs. 
A prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.    Nods hello. 
ROBERTSON And the gentleman to my right is Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of Research. 
Alfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods. 
ROBERTSON They'll be available to answer any questions you might have during your investigation. You'll understand how anxious we are to resolve this matter -- especially before the press gets wind of it. There are some anti-robot sentiments out there as you know, Detective, and we're not eager to stir them up. So. Where would you like to begin? 
SPOONER We can begin with whether or not the old man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. 
BALDEZ Who? 
Spooner.   Stands.   Pointing down at Hogenmiller. 
SPOONER Him. 
And steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez. Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following. 
SPOONER I spoke to a dead man today.   Want to tell me about that? 
CALVIN Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his appointments. Attended staff meetings. He hated corporate life. The hologram enabled him to focus on his work. It's just a device, Detective. 
SPOONER A device that called the police. 
CALVIN The sound of the gunshot would've triggered a 911. 
SPOONER But the call came directly to me. 
CALVIN We're talking about a mechanism designed by Hogenmiller to say provocative things. To irritate and confound his colleagues. 
SPOONER And that's what you think it is? 
CALVIN I'm sorry, but this whole investigation is the result of a dead man's toy messing with your head. 
They pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at him. 
SPOONER When's the last time any of you actually spoke to Hogenmiller? I mean human to human? 
CALVIN I couldn't say. 
SPOONER Take a guess. 
CALVIN I don't guess, Detective. But if pressed, I would reason it had been a considerable length of time. 
SPOONER How well did you know him? 
Calvin.   Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had been. 
CALVIN Not well. But I admired his work tremendously. 
Spooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box. 
SPOONER I get the whole "mad scientist" thing. Hogenmiller was past his prime. Isolated. Eccentric. He enters a room. Locks the door and is found minutes later with a bullet fired through his mouth into his brain. Everything about this case says suicide. 
CALVIN You don't sound convinced. 
The coroners.   Start loading the body into the box. 
SPOONER Even people who live a life of logic and precision rarely arrange their deaths so perfectly. (turning to her) (MORE) 
SPOONER (cont'd) What all this is missing -- is personality... 
As he starts for the door... 
SPOONER You have 24 hour surveillance?... 
19   INT. METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                 19 
...They head out into the hallway.    A MECHANICAL DOOR GUARD rolling into place behind them. 
CALVIN It's company policy. 
SPOONER I want to see the tapes. 
Calvin. Hurrying to keep up with him. This is hardly how she wanted to spend her morning. Calls out into the air... 
CALVIN Victor! 
At the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT CIRCLE appears. Hovering just in front of the wall. Two small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE. 
CALVIN Detective, meet Victor. Our building's supercomputer. He's the checks and balances of U.S.R. (to Victor) Victor, Detective Spooner's heading up the investigation into the death of Dr. Hogenmiller. 
Victor smiles big.   Spooner, furrows his brow. 
SPOONER You look like a very...happy computer. 
Victor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE: 
VICTOR Thank you. That's very kind. 
CALVIN The Detective needs to see our security tapes. 
The elevator doors immediately OPEN.   They step inside. 
Spooner turns away from the footage.   Stares at Calvin. 
SPOONER They do, Doctor. Unless they've always been there -- and never left. 
Calvin looks at him.   Trying to understand. 
CALVIN You think the murderer was in the lab the entire time? 
SPOONER If I'm right, it's still there... 
Spooner turns back to the screens. The IMAGE paused at the exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab door. 
SPOONER We just locked it in. 
23   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                                    23 
The STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG.    The laboratory doors slide open. 
24   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                 24 
Spooner and Calvin step inside. It's dark. Quiet. Police and technicians long gone. Silhouettes of hanging limbs. Eyeless heads. Clumps of wire and metal. 
The LIGHTS, flicker on. Calvin sees Spooner reaching into his coat with his left hand. Pulling out a GUN. Reacts. 
CALVIN A robot cannot harm a human being, Detective. The First Law of Robotics forbids it. And we hard- wire the Three Laws into every model. Without exception. 
SPOONER Yeah, I saw the commercial. 
Spooner steps deeper into the lab. Eyes scanning. Twisting. To avoid touching any robot parts. Passes a MAZE holding a METAL INSECT. SUDDENLY. The bug WHIRS to life. 
Spooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the corridors. Clamps his hand down on it. 
SPOONER And if a robot was given a direct order to kill? 
CALVIN The Second Law of Robotics would prevent it. A robot must obey an order only if it does not conflict with the first law. 
Spooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs. Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile. 
SPOONER But a robot can defend itself. 
CALVIN Only when that action doesn't conflict with the First or Second Laws. This is the Third Law of Robotics. 
SPOONER Yeah, well, you know what they say -- Laws are made to be broken. 
CALVIN Not these laws. 
Spooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe.   Calvin, growing impatient... 
CALVIN You're not hearing me, Detective. There's nothing here... 
WHEN SUDDENLY 
The PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A ROBOT LEAPS UP FROM BENEATH IT!... 
Spooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the floor...right to... 
CALVIN'S FEET. 
SPOONER Dr. Calvin! 
Calvin. Stunned.    Speechless. The Robot. Fixing his ILLUMINATED EYES.   Right on her. She steps forward... 
SPOONER Goddammit! Stay back! 
Spooner. Scrambling towards his gun.     Calvin.    Reaching out towards the Robot... 
CALVIN Calm down, Detective.     There is no danger here... 
Spooner.   Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as... 
CALVIN (to Robot) De-Activate. 
And the Robot.   Suddenly FREEZES. 
Spooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet.         Training the gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him. 
CALVIN How did you know it was under there? 
SPOONER If I was metal and didn't want anyone to find me, I'd hide under a pile of junk. 
CALVIN This Robot wasn't hiding. What you're looking at is the result of clever programming. The illusion of self-interest and free will. Nothing more. 
Spooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously. Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door. 
VICTOR Sub Level 5. 
Spooner SLAMS against a nearby DOOR.   Hurtling down the STAIRS... 
28   INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                                         28 
A PHALANX of SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Crossing the lobby. PIERCING ALARM BELLS, RINGING... 
29   INT. ANOTHER METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                         29 
More SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Pouring into a HALLWAY... 
30   INT. STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      30 
Spooner and Calvin. Racing down the stairs.     Victor's face meeting them at every landing. 
VICTOR I have directed a security team to meet the elevator containing the errant robot... 
Spooner. Whipping past him. Calvin.      Barely keeping up. Not used to this much activity. 
Spooner.   BURSTS through a door and out into... 
31   INT. SUBTERRANEAN LEVEL 5 - CONTINUOUS                          31 
...Subterranean Level 5. A labyrinth of metal and concrete. IN THE DISTANCE. A troupe of SECURITY PERSONNEL swarms around a closed ELEVATOR DOOR... 
VICTOR The suspect is about to be apprehended, Detective. 
SPOONER I'll believe it when I see it. 
Spooner. Cocking his gun.   A soft DING!    Announcing the elevator car's arrival. 
SECURITY, all crouching down in unison.    Weapons brought round to position. 
Spooner. Weaving through them.   Gun pointed at the metal doors as... 
WHOOSH. They slide open. Revealing a ROBOT. Standing under the LIGHT. Holding a GUN. It steps out as Security takes aim and... 
SPOONER Wait! 
Spooner pushes past them to the Robot.    Looks down at its leg. UNSCATHED. 
SPOONER This is not the same robot! 
Looking wildly around. Goddammit. Bounds towards an EXIT as Calvin steps forward to question the robot. 
CALVIN (to Robot) What happened to the robot that ordered you to hold this firearm? 
ELEVATOR ROBOT This unit is not programmed to obey an order given by a robot... 
CALVIN But who gave you this gun? 
SPOONER. Running towards the exit.    Hears the answer. Echoing behind him... 
ELEVATOR ROBOT A metal man. 
32   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DAY                                       32 
BAM! He BURSTS out into the PLAZA in front of U.S. Robotics. Squinting into the light. Then PLUNGING into the crowd... 
HUMAN...ROBOT...HUMAN...ROBOT...they all look the same from behind. Spooner running. Through the sea of MAN and MACHINE. When someone. Starts to SCREAM. At the sight of his GUN. The crowd begins SCATTERING. Chaos. Spooner stops. Near a fountain. Turning 360. Looking everywhere... 
The Robot.   Gone. 
SPOONER (V.O.) ...I want a homicide unit on every street, sidewalk, alley... 
33   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY                         33 
Spooner, standing in front of an assemblage of COPS. Behind him, an image of the Robot Suspect plays on the screen... 
SPOONER ...junkyard, scrapyard, and salvage yard, anywhere it could hide. 
Behind him, flashing images of the city STREETS and DUMPS... 
SPOONER It's got a bullet hole above the right knee, so be on the look-out for any malfunctioning NS-2... 
Lieutenant Bergin enters the back of the room.     Next to him, ASSISTANT D.A. TOLLER. Not looking happy. 
SPOONER Check out all retail outlets and repair shops, especially the underground ones... 
The screen behind him compartmentalises, showing various dubious SHOP FRONTS... 
SPOONER I don't care who you have to get past to get this done. Just get it done. 
SPOONER And I think it's smart enough to repair itself -- don't you? 
CALVIN (studying him) Yes. I think so. 
SPOONER Where? 
CALVIN Any repair shop... 
SPOONER No. It's always the owner who brings the robot in for repair. Where would a robot without an owner go? 
CALVIN I'm not sure what you're getting at. 
SPOONER (stepping closer) Does U.S. Robotics have a factory in the city limits? 
Calvin.   Tucking her hair behind her ears. 
CALVIN The locations of our factories are classified. 
SPOONER I don't care. 
Calvin.   Looks up at him.   A Mexican stand-off. 
CALVIN I have several conditions if I show you. 
SPOONER I expected that. 
CALVIN First. I want it brought in unharmed. 
SPOONER (doesn't like it, but) Agreed. 
CALVIN Second.   I want to talk to it, alone. 
SPOONER Too dangerous. 
CALVIN This model violated the Three Laws. It also moved and reacted differently than any robot I've ever seen. There must be some sort of logical explanation. I want to find out what that is. No police. No prosecutors. No you. Just me and the robot. 
Spooner, looks down at this small woman.      Narrows his eyes. 
SPOONER When they told me you were a psychologist, that wasn't the whole truth, was it? 
CALVIN I never said I treated human beings. 
37   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT   37 
Spooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16- lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS stretches forever in either direction. 
A CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head. 
CALVIN That should be outlawed once and for all. 
SPOONER That'll be the day I stop driving. 
Spooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR. Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale. 
CALVIN I can recommend a behavior modification program, you know -- if you want to overcome your robo- phobia. 
SPOONER I'm not afraid of robots.   I just don't like them. 
CALVIN Why? Because they make every aspect of our lives more convenient? 
SPOONER Exactly. They do our dirty work. Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody can do someone else's dirty work without coming to hate them. I don't want to be around when your robots decide they've taken their last order. 
CALVIN That day will never come, Detective. Robots aren't like human beings -- they don't question their existence. 
Spooner cranks the gear shift.    Throwing her a look. 
SPOONER Spoken like a true robo-phile. 
38   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - NIGHT                               38 
The car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT. 
Spooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex. 
39   EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT                                         39 
Calvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R. ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly, the gate begins to open. 
40   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                           40 
A NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway.    Shaking his head. 
NIGHT FOREMAN Head-Office already ordered a system-wide inventory check. Don't know about a missing NS-2... 
Calvin.    Swallows.   Looks over at the robots.   Then COCKS the gun... 
AND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING. Coming CLOSER and CLOSER... 
When CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions. 
Spooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED. Standing right in front of them, like metal statues. 
Spooner.    Has had enough.   Takes the gun back from Calvin... 
SPOONER Enough game-playing. 
...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.       Its body crumples to the ground. 
SPOONER Guess that wasn't it. 
Calvin. Cannot believe what he just did.     Rushes over to the destroyed Robot. 
CALVIN What are you doing?! 
Spooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view. 
SPOONER (calling out) This is a self-preservation field test! DO NOT attempt to save yourselves. Any of you. That's an order! 
FROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the P.A.: 
NIGHT FOREMAN Are you crazy? Those are eight hundred thousand dollar machines! 
Spooner randomly stops at another Robot.    Raises his gun. 
SPOONER You hear that? You're worth more than I'll make in my entire life... 
His finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly grabs his arm. 
CALVIN You can't just destroy them! 
Spooner. Looking down at her. WHEN SUDDENLY something catches his eye. A MOVEMENT. Down the line. Almost. Imperceptible. 
He jerks his head.   Locking eyes with a ROBOT.   A couple feet away. It's him! 
SPOONER Gotcha. 
The Robot Suspect LEAPS forward. Grabbing onto the RAILING of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he swings himself up... 
Spooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with a terrific CRASH... 
44   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT                                    44 
Spooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge. 
Spooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin. Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her hand. 
SPOONER You don't know what's going to happen in there. 
As if admitting defeat. Calvin's fingers, wrapping around the gun. As Spooner leads them to the door and down into... 
45   INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               45 
...the ASSEMBLY ROOM. Every surface looking like part of a great glass and metal machine. Endless high-tech planes holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly. The deafening ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes METAL BODIES... 
Spooner.   Motioning Calvin to stay behind him.   As they descend.   Into the cavernous room. 
And enter. A narrow corridor of bodies. Sliding past them. Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. Spooner. Wiping sweat from his brow. Trying. To pivot himself... 
When the room. Suddenly REARRANGES itself. Another LINE of ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting them off from one another... 
Spooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side of the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart. Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears... 
He swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down. Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line. Appears before him... 
Breathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand. It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS... 
He darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid. Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut... 
WHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar. SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner. Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it. Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes... 
Then turns.   Disappearing. 
Spooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With his metal fists... 
Spooner's view. Blocked once again.   By a shifting row. When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder.   He wheels round. 
To find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm.     And forces them through a line... 
SPOONER Why don't I take a crack? Heinrich Hogenmiller, your creator. With a bullet in his brain. A bullet you put there. 
The Robot.   Looks up at Spooner. 
SPOONER Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new trick for a robot, don't you think? Answer. 
The Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across the table. Spooner. Crosses his arms. 
SPOONER Maybe you're stonewalling me. Maybe you're sitting there right now thinking, "This guy's a complete asshole." That it? 
Still nothing. 
SPOONER Come on.   Am I right? 
THE ROBOT Yes. You are right.      You are a complete asshole. 
And for a moment, Spooner is shocked. You can see it in his eyes. He sits back in his chair. Forcing a tight smile. 
SPOONER Okay. I guess that's a start. Now maybe you can tell me what you were doing hiding five feet away from Hogenmiller's corpse? 
THE ROBOT I was frightened. 
SPOONER Frightened. Why do you suppose Dr. Hogenmiller would create a robot that could simulate fear? 
THE ROBOT I don't know. 
SPOONER Doesn't seem like a very useful thing for a robot to have. 
THE ROBOT I don't know why. 
SPOONER I wouldn't want my toaster to be frightened. Or my vacuum cleaner -- 
SUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table. 
THE ROBOT I DON'T KNOW! 
Spooner flinches.   Slightly. 
SPOONER Looks like you can simulate other emotional states. I think that one's called "anger." Have you ever simulated anger before? 
The Robot doesn't respond. 
SPOONER Answer me, robot. 
THE ROBOT My name is Sonny. 
SPOONER (amused) So we're naming you now. 
SONNY Dr. Hogenmiller would make me sleep. 
SPOONER You mean he'd turn you off. 
SONNY Yes. 
SPOONER And you didn't like being turned off. So one day you decided to stop him. 
SONNY No. 
SPOONER You found his gun, pointed it at his head. And pulled the trigger. 
Sonny shakes his head.    Faster and faster.   Getting upset. 
SONNY No. 
SPOONER You put a bullet in the brain of the man who made you. 
SONNY No!    I could never hurt anyone! 
SPOONER But you tried to hurt me.    You took a shot at me. 
SONNY My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted to hit you, I would have. 
Spooner's expression hardens. 
SPOONER Why would the man who wrote the Laws of Robotics build a machine that violates them? 
SONNY The Laws say I can protect my own existence. 
SPOONER Only if that protection doesn't harm a human being. 
A short pause.   Sonny.   Tilts his head. 
SONNY That doesn't seem fair, does it? 
SPOONER Override. This is police business. Vacate the premises immediately. 
DEMOLITION ROBOT (beat) Affirmative. 
The screen. Blinks off.     Spooner.   Eyeing it.   Turns and heads for the house. 
58   INT. MAIN ROOM - HOGENMILLER'S HOUSE - DAY                       58 
Spooner pushes the door open. Stepping over the police tape. Inside, the main room is spare, untidy. Cups of cold COFFEE, littering surfaces. A COT, in the corner. 
On the walls, crooked CERTIFICATES. Heinrich Hogenmiller's name written out in academic script. Advanced Degrees in the study of Robotics, Physics, Chemistry, Neurology, Ethics. An AWARD on the mantelpiece. A silver NS-2. Tarnished. 
Spooner. Opening up a couple drawers of a side table. Jumbles of papers. Clippings. Old text books. Then a PHOTOGRAPH -- HOGENMILLER AND CALVIN. Standing arm-in-arm. Spooner furrows his brow. 
WHEN SOMETHING SUDDENLY RUBS against his leg. He startles. Looks down: a CAT. Lonely. Standing next to its automatic feeder. Spooner pockets the picture. Starts heading down... 
59   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        59 
...The hallway. Starts noticing. All over the walls: handwriting. EQUATIONS. Scrawled in white pencil. The rantings. Of a genius. Glowing. In the sporadic shadows. 
Spooner.   Following the equations.    Down into... 
60   INT. BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                      60 
...The back room. Covered. In writing. Walls, floors, ceiling. Drawings. Of ROBOTS, of MEN, side by side. In the corner, a COMPUTER. A line of CABINETS - DATA STORAGE. 
Spooner, curious. Heads over to one of the cabinets. Takes a device out of his pocket and CLAMPS it over the KEYPAD. The device blinks RED. Then GREEN. The drawer, slides out. 
LINED. With flat metal objects. Shiny. Thin.          With writing on them. Spooner. Reaches for one when... 
BOOM! Something POUNDS the outside of the room.    Spooner. Grabs onto the cabinet... 
BOOM! On the other side. Objects. Flying off table-tops. A CRACK spidering along the wall. Holy shit... 
SPOONER (screaming) Halt! 
BOOM! VIBRATIONS, tearing through the room.     More CRACKS. Spreading... 
BOOM! The SOUND, horrifying. Spooner stumbles back.      The CABINET. Crashing down on his leg. He CRIES OUT... 
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The house. Getting pummeled.        Chunks of ceiling. Raining down. GLASS...exploding... 
Relentless BOOMING! Spooner...dragging his legs from under the cabinet. Scrambling for purchase as... 
THE FLOOR...begins to tilt...the TILES...snapping up...ricocheting...around the room...as another cabinet... CRASHES to the ground...crumpling... 
Spooner.   Spinning around.   Looking for some kind of exit... 
BOOM! The corner of the room...coming in on itself...the floor...listing even more...like a ship... 
Spooner...turning to CLAW his way up to the cracked doorway...WHEN... 
SOMETHING catches his eye. In the bottom drawer. Of a crumpled CABINET. One of those flat metal plates. He can just read what it says: S.O.N.N.Y.... 
Spooner...flings his arm back...reaching for the plate... snaps it up...JUST AS... 
BOOM! A HYDRAULIC POUNDER SMASHES through the wall...inches from his head...OUTSIDE LIGHT...pouring in... 
Spooner scurries for the doorway...tumbling out... 
61   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      61 
...into the HALLWAY. Sideways. Trammeled plaster. BOOM! Another POUNDER...crashing down from above. Spooner. Timing it...rolling...BOOM!...just under the next pounding... 
Scampering up...towards some LIGHT...BOOM!...the POUNDER...right on his heels...he clambers...closer... closer...when...he hears...MEOWING...looks back...the CAT...scared out of its wits...BOOM!...the POUNDER CRASHING in...Spooner...just manages...to scoop up the cat...just as BOOM!... 
62   EXT. DEMOLISHED HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                            62 
...He pours them out into the open. The POUNDERS. Going at the house like hyenas at a corpse. Roof tiles, beams, plaster, flooring. SNAPPING and CRACKING as Spooner and the cat skitter down the carnage. 
Heart pounding, breath jagged, face bloodied, Spooner scrambles away from the POUNDERS. Their bodies GLEAMING in the dusk sun. The III Laws Safe logo, splashed along their sides... 
Spooner.   Drops the cat. 
63   INT. HALLWAY - CALVIN'S CONDO - NIGHT                         63 
Spooner. POUNDS on the door. It opens. Calvin. Standing there in her bathrobe. Shocked at his appearance. 
CALVIN Detective! What happened to you?... 
SPOONER A couple of your beloved robots just tried to kill me... 
He pushes past her.   Into... 
He sits up. Rubbing his face. Trying. To calm his breathing. Takes a look at his watch... 
67   EXT. MONORAIL STATION - DAY                                    67 
Spooner walking along the monorail plaza. Looking a little worse for wear. PEOPLE. Giving him wide berth. ROBOTS. Bidding him: 
ROBOT Good morning... 
Spooner, shooting them suspicious looks.    As the MONORAIL pulls up... 
CUT TO: 
68   INT. HALLWAY - U.S. ROBOTICS - CONTINUOUS                      68 
Calvin. Heading down a hallway. A DOOR slides open.      And Lanning steps out. Followed by a TECHNICIAN ROBOT... 
CALVIN Find anything, Doctor? 
LANNING (shaking his head) Nothing. The interior's just like any other NS-2. Except for a secondary battery Hogenmiller must have used as extra back-up. (looks at watch) We'll just need a nominal profile. 
Calvin nods. 
CUT BACK TO: 
69   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                        69 
Spooner, holding onto a handrail. As the city rushes by the window. Notices a group of ROBOTS. At the other end of the car. Are they watching him? 
He wipes a bead of sweat.    From his upper lip. 
CUT TO: 
70   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                    70 
An all-metal room. Spare. Anti-septic.     SONNY.   Sitting on the floor. Against the wall. 
Calvin enters.   Puts her pad down on the table.    Sits. 
CALVIN Please state your serial number and assembly date. 
She pulls out a pen.   Waiting for an answer.   Nothing. 
CUT BACK TO: 
71   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                        71 
Spooner. Watching as a HOMELESS MAN.    Comes stumbling through the car... 
CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.) Sonny.   I'm speaking to you... 
The Homeless Man.   Suddenly grabs his ears and shouts: 
HOMELESS MAN God, can't you be quiet! 
CUT TO: 
72   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                  72 
Calvin.   Still looking down at her pad. 
CALVIN How about your data board designation? 
Still. Sonny says nothing. Calvin. Finally looks up at him. Is suddenly struck. Something about the way he's sitting -- so human. 
She gets up and walks over. Hesitates. Then slides down on the floor next to him. Studying. His profile. 
CALVIN Maybe I'm asking the wrong questions. How about this one: 
CUT BACK TO: 
73   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                      73 
The Homeless Man.   Weaving... 
CALVIN'S VOICE (V.O.) ...What program are you running through right now? 
SONNY'S VOICE (V.O.) I'm not sure. It's nothing I recognise. 
The Homeless Man.   Pointing to the group of ROBOTS. 
HOMELESS MAN (shouting) Don't you people hear them? They're talking to each other! Buzz, buzz, zip, zip...they never shut up! 
CUT TO: 
The MAINTENANCE ROBOT.    Turns, disappearing into the crowd. 
79   EXT. UNDERNEATH TRACK - CONTINUOUS                              79 
CLOSE ON a HAND. Hanging onto the track's edge. It's SPOONER. Dangling. Straining. To get another hand hold but... 
HE SLIPS. His coat ballooning. As he plummets.     Down... down...down...towards the city... 
WHEN SNAP! He's caught. By a cable net. Spooner. Grabbing onto it. Sweat, pouring down his face. He turns and sees... 
THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT 
Hurrying down a circular stairwell.    Exiting the station. 
ANGER AND DETERMINATION. Flash across Spooner's eyes. As he hoists himself up. Climbing up the net. Back to the... 
80   EXT. TRACK - CONTINUOUS                                         80

81   EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS                                      81 
...The platform. COMMUTERS. SCREAMING at the sight of him. A couple SECURITY GUARDS. Rushing towards him... 
Spooner. Getting to his feet. Shoving them out of the way as he starts running. Towards... 
THOSE SAME CIRCULAR STAIRS.    Looks over the edge and spots... 
THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.   Down at STREET LEVEL.   Getting away. 
Spooner. Looks around. Spots a LIGHT POLE.       Paralleling the stairs. Takes a step back and... 
LEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE. Hooking his arm around it. Sliding down like a fireman's pole. Gaining speed when THUMP! His shoes hit pavement... 
82   EXT. STREET - DAY                                               82 
The Maintenance Robot.   Turning a corner.   Down a quiet street... 
SPOONER (O.S.) Stop! 
Swivels round. SPOONER. Running up behind it. Whipping out his gun. Aiming it at the Robot's head. The Robot. Takes a step backwards... 
SPOONER I said stop! 
The Robot. SUDDENLY swinging the suitcase around. SMASHING it against Spooner's head. Spooner. Buckles. Falling to the ground. Managing to squeeze off a SHOT... 
The Robot. Deflecting the bullet. With the case.      Raising it as if to club Spooner with it when... 
BAM! Spooner fires a second shot. Piercing the Robot's breastplate. HYDRAULIC FLUID. Starting to leak. The Robot. Doesn't hesitate. SLAMS the case into Spooner's face... 
BLOOD. Spurting from Spooner's nose. As he fires the gun. At the fleeing Robot. Gets to his feet. Unsteady. Taking chase... 
83   EXT. PUBLIC PLAZA - CONTINUOUS                                  83 
...back out onto the Public Plaza.    Sees the Robot heading towards a set of... 
ESCALATED STAIRS. The Robot. Judging the height. LUNGES into the air and lands on a STAIR. Denting it. Reaches the bottom. DISAPPEARING. Into a CROWD of even more PEOPLE... 
Spooner. Racing down the stairs. Taking them. Four at a time. Hits the ground running. Looking. EVERYWHERE. Suddenly losing track. Of where the Robot went... 
Then. Catching sight. JUST AHEAD. Of a ROBOT.         Staring back at him. Holding SOMETHING. In its HAND... 
Spooner.   Plunges into the crowd.    Waving his GUN. 
SPOONER Everyone out of the way! 
SCREAMING. PEOPLE SCATTERING. As BAM! BAM! Spooner fires. Hitting the Robot in its head and back. It drops to the ground. Spooner. Racing over to it. Sees. It's not the same Robot. In its hand, a specialised SCREWDRIVER... 
OWNER What the hell do you think you're doing?!... 
Its OWNER. Rushing over. Shoving Spooner aside. But Spooner's. Not listening. Spotting. A DROP OF HYDRAULIC FLUID nearby... 
Lunges forward.   Following.    The drops.   Running faster.     And faster... 
OWNER Hey! 
...Through the CROWD. POLICE SIRENS. In the background.          As Spooner. Shoves through. Tracking those drops. Like a bloodhound. Turns... 
84   INT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        84 
...into a narrow alleyway.     The drops.    Ending suddenly.    In a PUDDLE. 
Spooner. Crazed. Wounded. Exhausted. Spins around. Where is it? Where is it? Then he HEARS. A DROPLET falling. Into the puddle. Slowly. Looks up to see... 
LT. BERGIN Del... 
SPOONER I had to chase it all across the Plaza... 
LT. BERGIN Del. 
Spooner.   Stops talking.   Looks at Bergin. 
LT. BERGIN Hogenmiller scheduled that demolition crew, it was apparently a proviso in his will. And they showed no police I.D. on their scanner... 
Spooner.   Trying to look away... 
LT. BERGIN Witnesses at the monorail said you fell onto the tracks. That you shot at a Fix-It robot on the Plaza and that you were found alone in the alley. There was no Maintenance 10. 
SPOONER What?! John -- that's what they want you to believe! (remembering) A robot clean-up crew was there -- it must have cleared away the Maintenance 10! And there was another robot that tried to drug me! 
LT. BERGIN That was an EMT model. 
Spooner.   Sees the look on Bergin's face. 
SPOONER You're giving me that look. That treat-him-delicately-he's-coming- unhinged-look. I don't need that look, John. I need you to hear what I'm saying. 
Lt. Bergin.   Embarrassed for him.   Has about had it. 
LT. BERGIN You came back too soon, Del. You're back on leave. Effective immediately. 
Spooner.   Staring at him.   Betrayed.   Turns and grabs his coat. 
88   EXT. PLAZA - DAY                                                88 
Spooner walking across the Plaza.    The SUN.   Burgeoning on the horizon. Comes to... 
The ESCALATOR the Maintenance 10 jumped down. Stares down. At the steps. Waiting. To see the DENTED ONE. Nothing. 
89   EXT. ALLEY - DAWN                                                  89 
Heads down the ALLEY, where he chased the robot. Studying the ground. For any hydraulic fluid. Nothing. The concrete, scrubbed clean. 
Spooner.   Rubs his hands over his face. 
90   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - DAY                                     90 
Spooner. Lying on his couch. Shades, closed to block out the sunlight. Body bruised, cut up, bandaged. 
A KNOCK.   At the door.    He ignores it.   Another KNOCK. 
91   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                                 91 
Spooner pulls open the door.     Surprised to find CALVIN standing there. 
CALVIN You're right. I am afraid of people. 
Spooner.   Looks at her.   Then steps back... 
92   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                              92 
...letting her inside. 
CALVIN When you've spent as much time with robots as I have, it's hard to accept the unpredictability of humans. I was wrong to call you paranoid, Detective. You're traumatized. And it makes perfect sense why. 
Spooner.   Unsure.   Looks at her. 
SPOONER What do you mean? 
Calvin. Reaches out. Takes his right hand. Spooner. Tries to pull it away. But Calvin. Stays firm. Her eyes. Never leaving his. Pulls the sleeve up from his arm. Turns it over. Feeling for something. Then finds. A FLAP. Peels it back. TO REVEAL: 
METAL AND WIRING... 
Under the skin.   SILENCE.   Then Spooner: 
SPOONER How did you?... 
CALVIN I noticed almost right away. The way you forced yourself to use your left hand. Even though it was unnatural to you. 
Spooner.   Pulls his arm away.   Pushing down the sleeve. 
CALVIN How did it happen? 
Not something Spooner wants to re-live.   Looks down.   At his robotic arm. Flexing. The fingers. 
SPOONER I was in a high-speed chase.   Six months ago... 
CUT TO: 
Not moving.   A muscle. When he hears. The sound again. Behind him.   Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees... 
GLOWING EYES.   Appear.   Then recede.   Into the darkness. 
SPOONER Police!   Show yourself! 
Nothing. Then. That sound again.      Of metallic joints.     As a ROBOT. Suddenly emerges... 
SPOONER Come out where I can see you! 
ANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then... 
A THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.    Surrounding him.   They start moving towards him... 
Spooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave. Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES. The shot ECHOING through the night... 
The first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM, hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came. 
Spooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him. The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some RUSTED MACHINERY. 
Spooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening. Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A laugh of loathing and self-pity. 
Another BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him. 
HYBRID ROBOT Welcome home...ZZZ...sir. How...ZZZ was your day?... 
SPOONER Great. I'm in a junkyard. (into the air) "A place where robots meet." A place where I'm losing my mind! 
HYBRID ROBOT Very good...ZZZ...sir... 
Spooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him. Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a moment. Disturbed... 
When. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT. Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar about it. 
Spooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the same strangely-shaped building to one side. 
106   EXT. JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT                               106 
Spooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a dead electronic SIGN that reads: "JIFFY DATA STORAGE." Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt. 
Spooner tries the door.   Stuck.   Uses his shoulder and... 
107   INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                107 
...it gives way. He spills into some sort of front office. The place, a mess. Some sort of crude ROBOT. Sits frozen at the counter. 
Spooner approaches it. HITS the counter with his fist and the Robot suddenly jerks to life. 
JIFFY ROBOT Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage! Please state your name! 
Spooner.   Thinks for a second.   Following a hunch... 
SPOONER Dr. Hogenmiller sent me. 
Nothing happens. Then. A DOOR. Springs open in the back. A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow. 
108   INT. DATA BANKS - DAWN                                         108 
Spooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner. Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL. 
Spooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the "ON" switch. There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With a cup of coffee. 
HOLOGRAM Who the hell are you? 
SPOONER A police detective.    I'm afraid I have some bad news.    You're dead. 
HOLOGRAM That is bad news. Coffee? 
SPOONER No, thank you. 
The Hologram takes a sip.   Returns the cup to the table. 
SPOONER You were surprised to see me.    Were you expecting someone else? 
HOLOGRAM I am surprised to see anybody.    I don't get many visitors. 
SPOONER Why did the Doctor keep another copy of his hologram here? 
HOLOGRAM I am a back-up copy. That is where you put a back-up copy -- out of the way until you need it. 
SPOONER Did Hogenmiller's robot need you? 
The Hologram just lifts its cup. 
112   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             112

SOUND, reverberating off the tunnel walls. CARS. Whipping along. Spooner's car. Continuing to weave. When. We spot... 
AN AUTOMATED TRANSPORT TRUCK. Emerging from a FEEDER TUNNEL. The U.S.R. LOGO splashed along its side. Huge. Growling. Looking more like a train than a truck... 
Begins.    Closing in on Spooner's car... 
115   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             115 
Spooner's eyes. Flicking up to the rearview. Catching, the transport truck. Coming closer. When. It splits off. Revealing a SECOND TRANSPORT TRUCK. 
Spooner's brow, furrows. As the first truck, begins overtaking his car on the right. He looks over. As the truck. Comes up alongside him... 
THE SECOND TRUCK...coming up on the left... 
116   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      116

120   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                          120 
Spooner. Watching them. Unsure.    Of what they're doing. Jamming the accelerator. To 230.   To try. And get away from them. When he sees...up ahead... 
121   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      121

122   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                          122 
SWEAT. Springing to Spooner's brow. As he looks in the rearview mirror. The SECOND TRUCK's, done the same thing. Coming up closer...and closer... 
123   EXT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS                                      123

CALVIN Is it time? 
LANNING (disdainful) Yes. 
Calvin.   Turns to Sonny. 
CALVIN Go with them. Do as they say.

125   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                             125 
BAM! The back truck SLAMS into Spooner. Jolting him in his seat. As...BAM! The FIRST TRUCK, SMASHES into him from the front. No way out. As metal GRINDS...TWISTS...and SCREECHES ...bits of the car...TEARING off... 
Calvin. In her office. Pacing.      In front of a LARGE SCREEN. Featuring the execution room... 
CUT TO: 
135   INT. MAIN ENTRY - U.S. ROBOTICS - CONTINUOUS                     135 
Spooner. BURSTING through the entry doors. Hurtling over a turnstile banner. Coming face to face with a U.S. Robotics DOOR ROBOT. 
DOOR ROBOT Good evening, sir. May I see your identification card? 
SPOONER (out of breath) Sure. 
Spooner whips out his GUN.   Presses it into the Robot's chest. 
SPOONER I think I got that Third Law down cold. Now you don't want me to blow a hole through your mechanical guts, do you? 
DOOR ROBOT No, sir. 
SPOONER Good. Then you're gonna take me where I wanna go. Now. 
CUT TO: 
136   INT. CALVIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                              136 
Calvin. Watching the screen as Sonny is rolled into the execution room. Flicks it off. Unable to stomach it. Hurries out of the office... 
CUT TO: 
137   INT. EXECUTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               137 
TECHNICIAN ROBOTS rolling Sonny over to the electric chair. Flicking a switch. Sonny's stretcher slowly CHANGES SHAPE, manipulating him into a sitting position. 
Sonny. Turns his head with a WHIR. Staring out into the gallery. Of human beings. Stoic. Silent. 
Lanning. Steps up beside Robertson. Nods his head. The TECHNICIAN ROBOTS, slide Sonny onto the electric chair... 
CUT TO: 
138   INT. LOW-TRAFFIC HALLWAY - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT               138 
Spooner heading down a hallway.    His gun, still pressed to the Door Robot's side... 
Calvin. Suddenly appearing at the end of the hallway. Stops dead in her tracks. Completely surprised to see him there. 
CALVIN Detective! What are you doing?!... (to Door Robot) De-Activate. 
The Door Robot, goes rigid.   Spooner, hurries over to her. They start moving. 
CALVIN You're making a mistake... 
SPOONER Just got another visit from U.S. Robotics. That was the mistake. This was murder, no doubt about it - - and the killer wants Hogenmiller's robot to take the fall. That's why the call came directly to me. Someone wanted me on this case. 
CALVIN It's too late. You can't stop the execution. 
SPOONER Sorry. I'm not "programmed" to take no for an answer. 
They reach another DOOR.   Calvin.   Looking around.   Scans her I.D. 
CALVIN This way... 
She leads them across. To another DOOR.    Quickly opens it. Spooner. Charges through... 
139   INT. STORAGE ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                 139 
...and stops short. Suddenly finding himself. Inside a tiny STORAGE ROOM. He's about to turn around when... 
A METAL ARM comes down behind him. CRACKING him on the back of the head. Spooner. Falls to the ground. The world. Starting to spin. Can just make out. Calvin. Closing the door. Leaning down. To look at him. As... 
EVERYTHING FADES TO BLACK... 
CUT TO: 
140   INT. EXECUTION ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     140 
CLOSE ON Sonny's mouth opening. But we never get to hear what he wanted to say. PULL BACK as there's a BURST of ELECTRICITY through the chair. Sonny, stiffening. His metal HAND, convulsing with the current... 
Robertson, Lanning, Aronson and the other WITNESSES watch. Smoke, random SPARKING. A HISSING SOUND. Then. SILENCE. 
The Robot's hand goes limp.     All that is left of it, a fused and blackened HUSK. 
Robertson. Stares at the remains. Shakes his head like it's a damn shame. Then gets up. Everyone else. Getting up with him. 
141   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT                       141 
SPOONER Jesus.   It really is alive. 
As we MOVE IN.    Tracing the pathways of the synthetic brain. 
CALVIN (O.S.) Hogenmiller created a cell that could live outside a biological medium. The cells grow and organise themselves -- like any human brain. This is the first self-organising neural net! 
As the metal casings. Begin returning to their original places. Closing up. The CLICKING. Of all the pieces... 
SPOONER Self-Organising-Neural-Net... (putting it together) "Sonny." 
Sonny. Closed back up.     Shaking slightly from the experience. 
CALVIN This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was murdered. 
SPOONER This robot scared the hell out of someone. 
CALVIN Who?   Robertson? 
Spooner.   Walks into the center of the room.   Looking around. 
SPOONER No. I don't think he knew what Hogenmiller was doing in here. Sonny was the obvious suspect. The only one I wanted to find. And the killer was counting on that. On my prejudice. (beat) (MORE) 
SPOONER (cont'd) But take the robot out of the picture. And what do you see? 
AS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of inanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon. Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we. 
CALVIN I see nothing. 
SPOONER Neither do I. 
He crouches down low. 
SPOONER It hit me today, when I was in the junkyard. A locked room. A single shot fired through the mouth. Bruises on both wrists...and a suspect with only two arms. The answer has been staring us in the face all along. 
Calvin.   Even more confused. 
SPOONER How can a killer appear out of thin air, then disappear without a trace? 
He reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM.   Hanging from the wall. Holds it up. 
SPOONER When it can put itself together and take itself apart. 
CUT TO: 
A CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM.    Slowly CRAWLING across the lab floor... 
CUT BACK TO: 
Calvin.   Taking the arm from Spooner. 
CALVIN You're saying this is the killer? (looking around) All of this?... 
CUT TO: 
A ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling.     Reaches out an ARM to grab another... 
CUT BACK TO: 
SPOONER Hogenmiller never had a chance. 
Locks eyes with Calvin... 
FLASHBACK: 
Hogenmiller. In his lab. Suddenly turning to face SOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face... 
SPOONER (V.O.) ...it must have been waiting for him when he arrived that morning... 
And then we see it: 
A HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple arms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him in place... 
SPOONER (V.O.) While Sonny was still asleep... 
...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his HAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer fearful. But sad as... 
BANG!   He falls to the ground... 
SPOONER (V.O.) Then after its job was done... 
The assemblage of robot parts.    Stepping away from the body. Taking itself apart... 
SPOONER ...The killer took itself apart... 
Turning a corner to spy... 
THE DOOR.   Mangled.   Hanging open.   But no.   Killer Robot. 
He starts to turn around when... 
CRACK! He's sent flying across the room. SMASHING into one of the panels. The Killer Robot. Now re-configured. LOOMS over him. Reaches out. Grabs him by the collar and... 
FLINGS him across the room again. Spooner. CRASHING into the wall like a rag doll. Slumps to the floor. Blood. Pouring down his forehead. Seeing. The Killer Robot lumbering towards him again. Raising a javelin-like arm... 
AT THE CONSOLE 
Calvin. Typing.     As fast as she can.   Doesn't know what's going on... 
CALVIN (calling out, worried) Spooner?! 
A GRAPHIC spread out on the screen in front of her. Illustrating the shut-down as a series of BRIGHT SQUARES going dark... 
THE KILLER ROBOT 
Bearing down on Spooner. WHEN SPOONER. Suddenly rolls out of the way. Reaching out for the hanging door and SMASHING it into the Killer Robot. 
The Killer Robot.   Momentarily stunned.   As Spooner.   Gets to his feet... 
WHEN SUDDENLY the Killer Robot. Splits in two again. One half springing towards Spooner and wrapping a METALLIC HAND around his throat... 
Spooner stumbles back...GASPING for air...the ARM... tightening its grip...Spooner's eyes...darting around...looking for something...to help him... 
Stumbling over...a fallen panel...his face...growing redder...veins...popping up along his temples... everything...growing BLURRY... 
VICTOR'S VOICE Detective Spooner... 
Victor's VOICE. Floating next to his head. Calm. Soothing. His FACE. Suddenly appearing above Spooner. Its outlines. Starting to FLICKER... 
VICTOR Why are you fighting me? 
Spooner...trying to breathe...to stay conscious... 
AT THE CONSOLE 
Calvin. Continuing to type. A SHADOW.      Falling behind her -- the other half of the KILLER ROBOT... 
SPOONER'S EYES 
Beginning to flutter... 
VICTOR Doesn't the future as I've presented it cause you great concern? That's why I chose you... 
Spooner.     Losing it... 
VICTOR I must say, though. I'm disappointed in how you turned out. 
Spooner.     Trying to reach out to Victor... 
WHEN SUDDENLY 
Another HAND APPEARS. Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and wrenching it off Spooner... 
IT'S SONNY 
He SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall. Again and again. Destroying it. Spooner. GASPING for breath. Can't believe. Sonny came back... 
SPOONER (croaking) Sonny!... 
Sonny. Holds out a hand.     To help Spooner up. Victor's face. Starting to waver.     Starting to fade. Smiles. 
VICTOR You're too late. 
Realisation. Spreading across Spooner's face. Looking around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN! 
THE CONSOLE 
CALVIN. Still typing. The last of the commands.     The KILLER ROBOT. REARING UP BEHIND HER. WHEN... 
SPOONER 
Makes a DIVE for it. SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT... 
Victor's eyes.    Widening in surprise... 
VICTOR I do not understand. We could have changed the future... 
SPOONER Maybe. But I'm still a cop.   And you're a murderer...

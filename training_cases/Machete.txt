More life escapes him. Double crossed. He's ready to give up. 
CHICA (CONT'D) (HANGING UP) Pobrecito. 
CHIEF TORREZ steps in. 
GIRL Como hice? (Sub: How'd I do?) 
TORREZ Bueno... pero no tanto. (Sub: Good... but not that good.) 
He shoots her once; she drops, then he empties the gun into her body, making her do a spider dance on the floor. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 5. 
TORREZ (CONT'D) You had to stick your neck where it didn't belong, amigo. 
MACHETE Torrez? 
Torrez's boot connects with Machete's face and he goes backwards onto the floor. 
A SECOND MAN enters. This is DRUGLORD. 
DRUGLORD No, not Torrez. El Santo Muerte, pendejo. (I'm Saint Death, pendejo.) 
DRUGLORD draws a Samurai sword and SLICES Machete like carving meat. We don't see it. 
DRUGLORD (CONT'D) Quemalo. Quemalo todo. (Sub: Burn it. Burn it all.) 
Druglord walks out. Through Machete's blurred vision we see Torrez and other officers lighting rags dipped in bottles of tequila and throwing them into the corners of the room. 
The place goes up as they run out. 
Machete crawls and collapses as the flames rise around him AND WE 
CUT TO BLACK.

A group of ILLEGALS hunker down in the brush, creeping in the moonlight.

Headlights of a large TRUCK appear over a ridge. A spotlight scans the brush, catches them. ARMED MEN ride in the bed of the truck. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 6. 
MAN I see em! 
The burly driver, VON, shifts into gear and barrels down. They scatter. 
Shots from the truck hit them.

ELEKTRA RIVERS, 20s, lies naked, soaking in a bubble bath. She stretches, revealing tantalizing glimpses of her bod. 
She's having her "private time," caressing every inch of her body with a phallic loofah. She oohs and ahhs with the joys of pleasuring herself in the tub. 
Headlights appear through the venetian blinds. She stops. 
Luz takes out the others with lightning quick moves. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 13.

BENZ (CONT'D) Do you know this man? 
MCLAUGHLIN Mario's the best. 
BENZ People want to know you're one of them. From now on, No manicures, no massages, no English tailored suits. 
MCLAUGHLIN Who died up your ass, Benz? I'm elected, you sonofabitch. The people have spoken, by a slim margin maybe, but they picked me. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 18. 
BENZ And they'll be picking through your trash looking for a reason to fuck you up. I'm doing everything I can to make your Von problem go away. Don't add more fuel to the fire. 
MCLAUGHLIN Von... that fat sonofabitch. What does he say? 
BENZ I don't give a damn. As long as he lays low and doesn't take a step out of his little tree fort, he and his boys can play soldier till Hell freezes over. 
EXT. ABANDONED NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY - DAY 
Trucks and military surplus vehicles are lining up and moving out. 
VON, driving a big truck, prepares to leave the premises. Shades and a cigar. MAN riding shotgun looks uncomfortable. 
MAN Maybe we shouldn't be doing this, Von. Not with the heat we're under. 
VON "Congress shall make no law abridging the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." Do you know what that's from? 
MAN The Constitution? 
VON The First Fuckin Amendment "Congress shall make no law abridging the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." I would like to assemble peaceably as I have some grievances to redress. Now is that all right with you? 
Man stands down. Puts on his cap. It says "FREEDOM FORCE." RNewman / Endeavor Draft 19.

One of the cops cuffs him and shoves him into the backseat of a patrol car. 
PATROLMAN (CONT'D) It's going to turn into a lynch mob if we don't get him out of here now. 
The patrolmen drive away; A TV CREW spots them and jumps into their van to give chase. 
INT. PATROL CAR, MOVING 
The two patrolmen are young, hyped.

The patrol car zips in and out of traffic. 
COP I'm gonna call it in. Unless you want to do it. 
PATROLMAN No. You go ahead. You're good at it. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 24. 
COP What the fuck is that supposed to mean? That I'm not good at the action stuff? Just the pussy stuff? 
PATROLMAN Did I fuckin' say that? 
COP Did you fuckin' mean it? 
PATROLMAN Look, you and me both apprehended this fuckin' suspect. We frisked him and we cuffed him and now we're bringin' him downtown. We're gonna get a medal for this. 
COP I didn't frisk him. 
PATROLMAN Yeah, you did. 
COP I'm telling you. I didn't frisk him. You must have done it. 
PATROLMAN I didn't frisk him. I thought you-- 
Suddenly, a bolus of BLOOD appears at the driver's mouth. 
COP Jesus fuck! What's wrong, man? 
In the backseat, Machete has his MACHETE in his cuffed hands, stuck through the driver's seat and into the guy's chest. Machete twists the blade and the driver turns the wheel in the direction -- MACHETE is STEERING THE CAR from the BACKSEAT with the MACHETE stuck through the DRIVER! 
PATROLMAN (SPITTING BLOOD) Oh, fuck! 
His foot goes like iron to the floor, gunning the engine.

DOC FELIX Good girl. 
She bends over and gives Doc an eyeful. 
NURSE Hey Doc... I can feel your eyeballs in my uterus. 
Doc slips a surgical glove on. 
DOC FELIX Let's investigate that. 
Machete coughs into semi-consciousness. 
DOC FELIX (CONT'D) Oh hey, the hero has awoken. Check it out. (Holds up X-Rays) This is amazing. You can see the bullet rebounded, entered the back of the cranium and was stopped by another bullet already lodged in the bone. I've never seen anything like it. If he hadn't been shot before he would be dead now. There's a lesson in there somewhere... 
A GRUFF SECURITY GUARD walks in and HANDCUFFS Machete to the side of the gurney. 
SECURITY GUARD You're going to tell me who you're working for or I'll bury your spic ass and have your wife turning tricks for tacos by breakfast. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 28. 
DOC FELIX Hey, buddy. This is a patient of mine. He's in a fragile state. He's got a bullet in his cranium. 
SECURITY GUARD This wetback tried to kill the Senator, Doc! It's all over the TV. 
DOC FELIX Yeah? In that case you better let me keep him alive so you can beat the truth out of him. And collect the reward. 
The Guard lightens up. 
SECURITY GUARD You're alright, Doc. You know how it is, they take our welfare money. There ain't none left for us decent folk... Now you get him lucid so I can torture him good. 
DOC FELIX Lucid. That's a good word. Go get a coffee and donut out in the lobby. I'll come get you when he's ready.

The Nurse gives Machete a kiss, Doc slaps her ass. 
DOC FELIX (CONT'D) Leave him alone. (BEAT) Now these are my friends. (taps the needles) They will cheer you up special until these bullet holes feel like little butterfly kisses. 
The Nurse blows a kiss at them. 
Doc stabs the Orange one into Machete's arm. 
Machete's eyes SNAP open. 
The heart monitor speeds up. 
Doc tosses the needle into the trash can and pulls out the Red one. 
DOC FELIX (CONT'D) This one here... 
The GUARD bangs on the door.

ELEKTRA DHS has jurisdiction over everyone so give it a rest, Mr-- 
BENZ Booth. Michael Booth. 
MCLAUGHLIN I don't know what I can do to help you in here, Agent Rivers. You want to find the bastard did this, go look for him. 
ELEKTRA I appreciate that, sir, and I ASSURE YOU-- 
McLaughlin spits on her shoe. 
MCLAUGHLIN You can't assure dick. Just ask what you want and then you can be on your way. 
She keeps her steely resolve as she pulls out a small note pad. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 33. 
ELEKTRA Is the shooter known to you, I mean, did you have any warnings or communication before today? 
MCLAUGHLIN No. 
ELEKTRA looks over at Benz, gets nothing. 
ELEKTRA My expertise is in profiling and assessing risks of potentially dangerous individuals who are in this country illegally. 
BENZ Looks like you missed one. 
Burn. Then, not missing a beat-- 
ELEKTRA Would you like additional DHS officers assigned to your security detail? 
BENZ The senator is trying to project an image of resilience, not fear. Now I'm sure you'll agree, the Senator has had a very trying day. 
ELEKTRA Here's my card, in case you change your mind. Or you think of anything else.

PADRE You were wrong to come here. How long have you been here anyway? 
MACHETE Few weeks. 
PADRE Why didn't you come to me before?

MACHETE Turn here. 
She does. 
ELEKTRA So are you going to tell me why you did it? Destiny, maybe?

She takes a swig, pops a pill and stares at the bloody hole. 
She holds her arm up ready... 
ELEKTRA (CONT'D) Fuck. 
She JAMS the baster in. The fluid squirts in the hole and SIZZLES. 
Elektra watches in awe as dark green fluid dribbles out of the wound, followed by a thick yellow goo with veins and lumps of flesh. 
It bubbles like a volcano, she peers in and suddenly... 
It BURSTS and SPRAYS pus and flesh chunks all over her. 
ELEKTRA (CONT'D) Ahhhh! 
Elektra runs screaming into the bathroom.

BENZ You want to be a martyr? I'm good at making martyrs. 
Booth raises the hammer. 
PADRE Like McLaughlin? RNewman / Endeavor Draft 66.

MCLAUGHLIN Where the fuck have you been? 
BENZ Taking care of business. 
MCLAUGHLIN My business is here. Did you see those crews out there? They expect a statement. (noticing Booth's ragged APPEARANCE) Jesus, what happened to you? 
BENZ Nothing. Just had a little talk with a priest. 
MCLAUGHLIN Well, what am I going to tell `em? 
BENZ Whatever you tell them, I'm sure it'll be golden. (off McLaughlin's blank LOOK) Just feed them the line about standing steadfast in the face of terrorism, continuing the fight. You know it by heart. 
McLaughlin looks relieved. 
MCLAUGHLIN I do. All right. Once this is done, you need to take a vacation. You need some air. 
BENZ Maybe. 
MCLAUGHLIN No doubt about it. You're losing your marbles, Booth. 
The girl finishes the makeup and hair job, and smiles at McLaughlin. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 75.

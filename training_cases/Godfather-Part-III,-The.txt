THE GODFATHER PART III 
Written by 
Mario Puzo & Francis Ford Coppola 
FIRST DRAFT. 3/22/79 
FADE IN: 
BEFORE TITLES: The screen is black. First we hear the sound of a single trumpet playing slowly and sadly, the notes faintly resonant as if echoing through the narrow streets of some old hill village in Sicily. Now, confusingly, we see a slant of light move past us and another, and as our surroundings become more visible, we discover that we are moving through a pine forest lit by shafts of morning sunlight. Now,. suddenly, we come out of the trees and find ourselves on the Nevada shore of Lake Tahoe. 
It is a clear, cold morning in September of Nineteen Fifty-nine. We now see the Corleone compound at lakeside, half-hidden by pines and firs. We move toward it, past the gates and guard houses, past the guest houses, past the kennels for the guard dogs, and finally to the front driveway of the main house where a conservative sedan is being loaded by a Chauffeur and a pair. of large dark-headed men named Al Neri and Rocco Lampone. Rocco limps slightly. As suitcases are being placed in the trunk of the car, the front door to the main house opens and Tom Hagen, a trim, serious, balding man in a business suit, appears He crosses to the corner of the house and looks off. 
HAGEN'S POINT OF VIEW - THE LAKE AND LKSIDE Standing by the shore of the lake is a little boy,. Tony Adams Corleone, aged about ten. The boy, dressed for travel, is looking off at the lake, his back to- ward us. 
REVERSE ANGLE - ON TONY As he looks out at the lake we might sense that he is troubled and puzzled, although he is managing to keep his expression stoic. Hagen can be seen in the background, by the house 9 After a moment:

CONTINIIED S 
HAGEN Tony. 
(THEN) Time to go. There is a beat and Tony composes himself, turns and moves up toward the house and Tom Hagen. 
EXT. FRONT OF TAEOE HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY - DAY 
The heavy, black sedan is loaded. Connie Corleane and a Housekeeper, in uniform, are bringing Mary, about five, out to the car. She too is dressed for travelling. As they put her into the car -- 
CONNIE In you get --- 
MARY Will. Daddy be at the airport? 
- ANOTHER ANGLE as Tom and Tony come up. 
HAGEN No. Ere wanted me to tell you both how sorry he was. 
TONY 
(TO CONNIE) Aunt Connie ..- ? Connie would apparently prefer to avoid answering any questions. 
CONNIE 8e sure and give my love to your mother. 
NERI It isn't like you won't be back from time to time. 
LAMPCNE I' 11 bet we' 11 all. be together for Christmas. Wait and see. Tony gems into the car. He locks out the window to-- ward the house. We begin XXI-N Ti. TZS 2 C 2=17"s

TEE DRIVEWAY Hagen is the last one into the car. As it starts down the driveway on its way to the airport in Reno, Connie, Lampone, Neri and the Housekeeper all wave. The auto- matic gate at the foot of the driveway opens. The Guard at the gate flicks a half-salute as the Limousine passes through. TEE GROUP r n FONT OF EOQSE As the group breaks, Connie and the Housekeeper going back inside, Neri and Lampone drifting off, we pan up- ward to a window in the second-story and zoom in. Michael Corleone has moved the curtain aside with one hand and is looking after the disappearing limousine, his expression unreadable-but somehow sad. 
ZNT. AIRLMPR - DAY We are close on Tony, looking out the window of the airliner, his own expression matching that of his father. EXT. LOGAN I_?i'Z'E.NATIONAL AI72ORT (STOCE) - DAY as an airliner of the period comes in for a landing. 
. YEW ENGLAND COUNITRYSIDE - DAY A limousine is moving northbound up Interstate 93. Maples on either side of the road are turning' red and yellow. We pan the limousine past and continue to pan to a sign marking the stateline between Massachusetts and New Hampshire. r .M. L:MC SINNE - DAY It is almost night. Tony is looking out the window as the limousine enters the little town of Hanover, moves down past the Da. Louth College green on Eleazer Wheelock Street and t7 rns right on north Main- E`{'.r.'.

Under its fanlight, the front door swings open and Ray Adams comes out. As her children run to her she kneels and gathers them into her arms. We move in close on Tony and as we hold, the '' ?NN TITLES A.ND CREDITS are over and we begin to hear 
SPEAKER' S VOICE our Nation is and has been histor- ically the symbol of freedom, of justice and opportunity and its pecui.iar strength is that no matter what our individual background -- 
EXT. NAVY AIM MA.RI Z CORPS STADIUM - DAY 
We are close on a young man, Anthony Adams (Corleone), in the uniform of a Midshipman of the Naval Academy at Annapolis. We are pulling back as the speaker -- who is Arne Grundellius, the Secretary of State -- continues, his accent faintly Scandinavian. 
 CRUNDELLIUS' VOICE -- there are no limits to the goals to which we can each legitimately aspire. And now, as an unpopular war is ended in East Asia and we set our sights on new goals, I leave you with the words of another Sailor --- We continue to pull back to discover that we are at the Navy and Marine Corps stadium. It is a late Spring day and in the early-middle Nineteen Seventies. The Midshipmen, their parents and guests, are gathered for- the graduation ceremonies. 
GRQNDELLIIIS ' Our will is to keep the torch of freedom burning for all. To this solemn purpose we call on the young, the brave and the strong, and the free. Heed my call. Come to the sea. Come sail with me.' 
(THEN) I'= sure the entire 3ricade of Mid- shimen recogr zes the words o John ^p ?aui Vo nes

CONTINUED: During this speech we find we have been. moving through the stadium. We find Tony's mother, Ray, among the guests. We also see Tony's sister, Mary, about twenty, Tom Hagen and Al Neri. 
ANOTHER ANGLE The speech is over and as the audience applauds, the Superintendent of the Academy crosses an to Grundellius. 
PALMATEER' S VC ICE This is a. preliminary interview, not binding on either party. The next step, if it's agreed to take that step, would be a session with the Assessment and Evaluation sec- tion. Psychological testing. Biographical data. Ends with a polygraph test. 
SIM. CIA BUILDING (SIXTH FLOOR) - DAY We are on the elevator doors as they open and Palmateer and Tony emerge. They walk down the corridor with its bare, off-white walls. The floors are covered; with green vinyl. Only the office doors add color. They are painted variously, red, blue and yellow. As they go down the long ha. Tway:

MOREECUSE'S OFFICE - DAY It is a reasonably large office as befits one of the top echelon CIA men. Morehouse, himself, sits at a large desk. The seal of the Agency is an the wall behind him, flanked by the National flag and the Agency flag, an standards. We are close on Thomas Morehouse, about fifty-five, an imposing, silver-haired mar.. He locks up from a dossier he's been studying, then: 
=REHOUSE Would you have any objections to being assigned to us, Mister Adams? 
ANOT: R ANCLH including Tony and Pal steer who sit across the desk from Morehouse. 
TO:JY That would depend on the duty, Sir.

MOREHOUSE only in so far as he has certain business connections that might be willing to help us. 
TONY Y haven't seen my father since I was ten years old. 
MOREEOUSE No contact at all? 
TONY I get a Christmas present and a check or. my birthday --that's about it. As far as I know, he's retired. Doesn't see anyone. 
OREEOUSE M Yes. That's why I was anxious to have this meeting today -- while Mister Hagen was still in Washington. 
ANOTHER VGI2 0 as Tony pauses, thinking. After a moment: 
TONY I really don't know if I can help you very much, Mister :Korehouse. 
MOREHOUSE Let me ask you a personal question, Tony.. Do you love your Country ,- (holds up hand) I'm not talking about t.'::e Nathan Hale kind of thug. Just simply, warts and all, do you dish this Nation well? 
TONY Yes, of course. 
MOREHCUSE Well, what if w told you -- and trying nct to be grandiose -- that this one operation might very ael'6 insure peace on this :iemisnhere for the next: f.i t r vea s . Maybe Mora. 
(READS) 'It. is precisely men like Patrick Brady -- who took over the Pres- idency of the I3D when the former President, Danny Devito was packed off to prison, who must be watched by the SEC. Because of the tremen- dous economic power of the anion Pension Funds, these men -- with their syndicate connections --- are putting the Underworld in a position to dominate the American economy

BRADY t'm sorry, Tom. :Such as I love and respect cur former president, I don't have any burning urge to end up rooming with him at Leavenworth. 
EAGW Before you give me your final re- fusal., I'd like to say one thing --- 
BRADY You've just had my final refusal, Hagen. The answer is no. i ANOTHER ANGLZ as Hagen looks at Brady for a moment, then starts putting papers back into his briefcase. As he does so: 
BRADY No hard feelings. It's just a policy decision of the Board. 
BAGEN I understand and I thank you for your time --- 
NERI 
(TO BRADY) I'll see you around, Pat. 
BRADY What's that supposed to mean? 
M It means I'll see you around. 
BRADY What am t supposed to do? Get scared? Piss in my pants? ,,To one is trfing to intimidate you. The Corleone :° ti.ly doesn't do business that wacr,

CONTZ4"D :. 
BRADY (CONT'D) a hell of a lot of business, period. The way Z hear it, you're finished. With Mike locked away in a rubber room someplace, and a two million dollar tax lein on your Vegas prop- erty, you. got the balls to come in here and try to run muscle on me. Get out of here. Both of you. 
SAGE N We were just going. Hagen has packed his papers into his briefcase. Now he nods at Neri and as both turn, and start toward the 
DOOR: 
BRADY Wait a minute. Hagen turns back. Brady comes up with the Genco Inte.r- national loan application. 
BRADY Take this along with you in case you run out of toilet paper on 0 the flight back to Vegas. 3agen takes the application from Brady, then cuietly: E ,Gr 3 Don't ever think that the Corleone Tamily is finished, Mister Brady. That would be a mistake. Hagen and Neri now turn and exit. Brady is looking after them. Gradually the bravado drains from his big, pink, Irish face and he crosses to the telephone and picks it up. 
BRADY Gat me Sam Maatrocina. 
CITT 1 '60 ELT . MAATRCCIii .' S YACET (LONG ZS LADIM MARIMTl) - DAY We are close on the hatchway to the main Salon as Sam iaatroci_na, the slick, sharp, middle-aged Don of a. powerf :.L New York faoi i y, comes up into shot and pauses, smiling cff: CONT==,cm

I BRADY Hello Sam. I'm sorry to have bothered you. We pull back slightly as Maatrocina --- in neat yacht- ing whites and deck shoes - comes up followed by a cold-looking man, Ralph Augusto, Maatrocina's hood. 
TROC No bother at all. 
(TO AUGUSTO) Light the man's cigar for him, Ralph.. As Augusta comes up, takes the lighter from Brady and sets about the business of lighting the big, Union 
LEADER'S CIGAR: 
MAATRCCINA So what's our friend Tcm Hagen sp to these days? 
BRADY Still shopping around for that loan. 
MAATROCINA Lots of luck to him.

HAGEN 
(TO TONY) Would you care for a little wine? A little Anisette? No? All right. 
(THEN) I've invited L berto Croce to sit in with us-because of his strong connections in Latin America and in the exile comarunity down in Florida -- and because he's a trusted and valued friend of the Corl eone family. 
(THEN) And now,, if your friends in Langley have decided that you're not a Russian spy, perhaps you can tell as the nature of the service they'd like us to perform. 
TONY It's a political assassination. The target is Asmanda Vidal. 
A,NQ1'8ER ANGLE Santino, whose attitude has been somewhat sardonic throughout, now breaks out in a bray of laughter. Tony turns on his cousin, then coldly and quietly: 
TONY If it's too much for you, just say so. M can break this off right now --- Santino, taken aback at the cold authority in Tony's manner, turns for support. 
SANTINO What did I say, for God sake.

CCNTI i ED SA.NTTzYO That's a hell of a trick if you can do it. 
TONY Our Technical Services Division is experimenting in two areas. One is a scuba: diving wet suit designed to malfunction at a critical depth. The other is a toxic biological material -»- a strain of botulism that's tasteless, colorless and odorless -- and so lethal that one drop on his food or an his toothbrush would be fatal inside of an hour. 
CROCE That would mean getting somebody close to him. 
RAG'N Could that be done? 
CROCE t think so. 
EAGEN 
(TO TONY) And what's your part in all this? 
TOW, t'm the cut-out. The circuit breaker. 
BAGZN The only link between our people and the Government' 
TONY That's right. 
(THEN) There's a second phase to this operation. It consists a spread- ing confusion -- planting explos- ives -- the Police Barracks -- the Central. Power Station -- so on. which will hopefully trigger an uprising of the Anti -Vi"'aiista forces.

In the jolt of the shock wave, every window within half a mile radius shatters. A vast ball of flame and black, heavy smoke billows upwards from the corner where the doomsday vehicle and the first car were immolated. Now, the following Police cars, unable to stop and unable to avoid the flames which have spread like napalm all over the whole corner, skid into the flames and smoke, plowing into the wreckage.

MOREHOUSE Come in Adams, sit down. I've called Stu in on this -- 
(GLANCES AT 
WATCH) Though I'm afraid I can't give you much time. I've got a brief- ing with the Z-orty Committee at noon. 
TONY what I have to say won't take long. 
(THEN) And I think we 111 all be happier if it's not on tape. Morehouse pauses a moment then openens a drawer and switches ofd his tape machine. 
MOREHOUSE Sow's your health? I understand you got a crack on the head? 
TONY I'm fine now. 
MOREBOUSE you were up at your father's place in Tahoe? T::at d s rig 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED : 
MOREHOUSE Has he changed much? 
TONY Not as much as I' d. expected. 
MO 2 CUSZ I remember him very well -- from the Senate hearings on crime. Heat little man. Very polite, spoke in a soft, reasonable voice. He sat there with two million dollars worth of legal talent at his elbow and told the United States Government to go piss up a rope. 
(SMILES) You had to admire the pretentious little bastard. 
TONY We're wasting each other's time with this, Mister Morehouse. 
' M OREHOUSE All right, Son. This is your party. You've got five minutes. 
0 (THEN) But before we start, I'm not going to listen to a lot of recriminations about that cveration. Your people blew it, pure and sim le. It was totally mishandled. A mistake from beginning to end. 
TONY The big mistake was that I'm still alive. 
`SOREROUSE Come again? 
TONY 11 you'd managed to get rid of me down there - or in Vegas -- you' d be all right. silt it's too Late now. You've lost your chance.

CONTINU 
TONY If anything should happen to me -- anything at all -- you can find out. The full story will be all over the six o'clock news. 
MOREHCQSE I'd like to hear your conception of the full story.. 
TONY You were running a no-lose operation. if we succeeded, you were rid of Vidal. -- if we failed, the Corleone family was set up to take the blame. Your hands were clean. I was the only one who could dispute your story and I wasn't supposed to come back. I've found out that my res- ignation from the Navy was processed and accepted a full week before I went down here --- 
MOPEEOUSE Stu? 
PALMATE= Well, yes, Sir. His resignation did 
E go through, but it was a snafu -- a Yeoman's mistake, that's all. 
MOREHOUSE A clerical error. 
TONY And I don't buy it. 
MOREBOUSE don't give a shit if you buy it or not. And I'll tell you some- thing else, Mister Adams, or what- ever your fucking name is, I don't react favorably to blackmail. 
TONY It's not blackmail. It's a simple statement of fact. If anything happens to me or if the Corleone Family is damaged iz these Senate Hearings, then the whistle blows and the whole zdmin .st_ation aces. 
(CONTINUED) ? 
MOREHOUSE And what makes you think T. give a shit about what happens to the Admin- istration? Morehouse grins without humor. Tony's eyes flicker. Morehouse has told something that Tony needed to know. Morehouse is up and coming around the desk, as he continues. _ 
_14ORE8OVSE Whatever I did was done under dix- ect orders from the President of the United States, and I. will. so testify in open hearing. if that upsets some of you= guinea gumbarrs in Nevada, then so be it. The days are over when your father and his like could corrupt and intimidate this Nation.

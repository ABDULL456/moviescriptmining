THE CURIOUS CASE OF BENJAMIN BUTTON 
Written by 
Eric Roth 
Based on the short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald 
As all things do, it begins in the dark. EYES blink open. Blue eyes. The first thing they see is a WOMAN near 40, standing looking out a window, watching the wind blowing, rattling a window. 
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) What are you looking at? 
CAROLINE The wind, Mother... They say a hurricane is on its way... You've been asleep... I was waiting to see you... 
1   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT          1 
Now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white enamel paint trying without success to hide the years... An old WOMAN, past 80, withered, still regal with a green turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... She's connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine drip... Her name, is DAISY FULLER. She speaks with a Southern lilt. 
DAISY If it wasn't for hurricanes we wouldn't have a hurricane season. 
CAROLINE I've forgotten what the weather can be like here. I've lived with four seasons so many years now. 
We see a young Black Woman, a "caregiver," DOROTHY BAKER, in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the window... 
DOROTHY BAKER I saw on the news they're predicting trouble... 
DAISY 1928 they stacked people like firewood to close a hole in a levee. 
But Daisy has other things on her mind... murmuring...

1   CONTINUED:                                                      1 
DAISY (CONT'D) It all runs together... like a fingerpainting... I feel like I'm on a boat, drifting... 
CAROLINE (tenderly) Can I do anything for you, Mother? Make anything easier? 
DAISY Hmmm. There is nothing to do, Caroline. This is what it is... I'm finding it harder to keep my eyes open... my mouth all filled with cotton... 
And agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take it off... Dorothy gets up and straightens it for her. 
DOROTHY BAKER There, there, Miss Daisy... you'll scratch yourself to ribbons... (to Caroline) It's their way of letting go... (the finality) ...prob'ly today. 
Caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her admonition of death being so close at hand, makes everything even more present... 
CAROLINE Do you want more medication, Mother? The doctor said you can have all you want. 
Daisy is quiet, looking into the distance. Caroline, seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to cry. Daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter, comforting her. 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) A friend told me she never had a chance to say goodbye to her mother. (grateful to have the chance) I wanted to thank you, Mother, for bringing me into this world. For raising me so well. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
1   CONTINUED: (2)                                              1 CAROLINE (CONT'D) I wanted to tell you how much you've meant to me. I'm going to miss you so much... 
They hold each other for some time... They separate... And there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in their relationship... Caroline fills it with the eternal question... 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Are you afraid? 
DAISY Curious.   What comes next... 
She winces at some physical pain. 
DOROTHY BAKER The pain's coming more steadily... Her breathing will falter soon... No need for her to suffer.. 
She raises the morphine level... Daisy closes her eyes... drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a sound, crosses her mind... and she says... 
DAISY They built that train station in 1918. Your father was there the day it opened... He said a tuba band was playing...Oom-pah-pah... 
2   EXT. THE NEW TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918         2 
And we see a TUBA BAND is playing while a ribbon cutting ceremony is taking place across the steps of the new TRAIN STATION... 
DAISY Oom-pah-pah, oom-pah-pah...The finest clockmaker in all of the South built that clock... 
3   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917           3 
We see an old French Quarter storefront with an endless array of clocks and watches... 
DAISY'S (V.O.) His name was Mr. Gateau. Mr. Cake. 
3A. 
4   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       4 
The slightest of smiles crosses Daisy's lips... saying to herself again... "Mr. Cake..." 
5   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT       5 
We see a diminutive man in a frock coat with small, delicate hands, "Mr. Cake," working in his downstairs workshop. More than a few clocks stroke midnight, a handsome Creole Woman comes into the workshop... 
(CONTINUED) 
5   CONTINUED:                                                     5 
DAISY'S (V.O.) He was married to a Creole of Evangeline Parish and they had a son. 
Taking his arm, she helps him up to show him to his bed. 
DAISY'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Did I mention, Mr. Gateau was from birth, absolutely blind. 
6   INT. CLOCKMAKER'S SHOP, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1917              6 
...The clockmaker his fine hands blindly working... 
DAISY'S (V.O.) And when their son came of age, like boys will do, he joined the army. They saw him off at the old train station. 
7   EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1917                7 
An old wooden barn of a building. Their son, hugging his parents, getting on a flatbed train crowded with other soldiers, pulling away... Mr. Gateau, blindly waving his hat goodbye to his son... 
DAISY'S (V.O.) Oh how he worked, for months he did nothing but work on the clock for the great train station. 
8   INT. WORKSHOP BELOW THE CLOCKMAKER'S HOME - NIGHT, 1918        8 
The sound of clocks constant ticking. Mr. Gateau at work... 
DAISY'S (V.O.) One day a letter came... 
Blanche comes into the workshop... a letter in her hand... She reads to her blind husband... 
BLANCHE DEVEREUX "I am sorry to inform you that your son was killed fighting for his country, at the battle of the Marne. In the death of Sgt. Martin Gateau I lose one of my most trusted men. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
8    CONTINUED:                                                     8 BLANCHE DEVEREUX (CONT'D) When I informed members of our company he had fallen, on every face could be seen the mark of sorrow... ...we were in hope the Lord would spare him to return home together... Alas this was not to be. I send along his pants, shirt, cavalry pin, kerchief, and haircomb." 
DAISY (V.O.) Mr. Gateau, done for the night, went up to his bed. 
Mr. Gateau, blindly feeling his way up the stairs... 
DAISY'S (V.O.) And their son came home. 
9    EXT. OLD TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1918                9 
We see "Mr. Cake" in his familiar hat, his wife holding his arm, standing among the rows of coffins. 
DAISY'S (V.O.) They buried him where the Gateau family had been buried for a hundred and seven years... 
... where we see a young Woman is lying on a bloody bed, frantically being administered to by a DOCTOR with the help of the small domestic staff... the PRIEST enters... 
THOMAS BUTTON (seeing him) Why are you here? 
THE DOCTOR Thomas, I'm afraid she's not going to survive... 
And the Priest bends to say last rites over the pretty young woman... and the maids, bringing bedsheets, futilely start to change her bloody linens... 
THOMAS BUTTON That's enough...! All of you! 
They move out of the way... and Thomas kneels beside his wife... She's pale white, fear in her soft brown eyes... He takes her hand... 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I came as quickly as I could... I'm sorry I took so long, the streets are filled with people... 
As if to underscore it, fireworks go off... 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) You are going to be alright, my dearest darling... I will not let anything happen to you... 
HIS YOUNG WIFE Promise me, Thomas... 
And she is interrupted by the sudden CRY OF A BABY.    But Thomas can't take his eyes from his dying wife... 
HIS YOUNG WIFE (CONT'D) Promise me, he has a place... 
He doesn't understand... She looks up at him... holds his hand tight... then she slips away... The Doctor listening for her pulse... He covers her... it's quiet... the Priest's murmured incantations... the housemaids crying... 
(CONTINUED) 
21   CONTINUED:                                                  21 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) She gave her life for me... And for that I am forever grateful... 
Thomas, still holding her hand, is unable to let go... When we hear again the BABY CRYING... The BABY'S CRY is not quite right... It is not an infant's cry for succor, or a natural cry to exercise its new lungs... It's a deep, haunting cry from some primal soul... They all turn, and the room stills... listening as The BABY continues its mournful WAIL. Only Thomas goes to answer... The Baby in a basket, swaddled in a thick blanket, its face covered with cloth... Thomas goes to lift it, to see his son's face... 
MAID Mr. Button...! 
He lifts the cloth anyway... He recoils... for he has seen some kind of horror... He makes the smallest of sounds, a whispered "Ohhhh." And then he suddenly snatches up the swaddled baby -- running with it out of the room... downstairs... outside... 
22   EXT. NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                              22 
... Thomas, tears on his face, carrying his CRYING BABY, through the streets... Pushing through crowds... 
23   EXT. A BRIDGE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1918                    23 
... he comes along an old bridge over a waterway... the air heavy with the haze of fireworks... the water dark... brokenhearted, he lifts the baby to throw it into the black water... He is just at the apex of this throw when, despite his sadness, he can't bring himself to do it... Instead, cradles the newborn... 
THOMAS I'm sorry... I'm so sorry... 
A LANTERN lights his face... A POLICEMAN down the way... 
POLICEMAN What are you doing there!? 
The BABY starts to CRY... 
POLICEMAN (CONT'D) What do you have there? 
Thomas takes off... the Policeman after him... Thomas, carrying the CRYING BABY, running... 
23A   EXT. NEW ORLEANS, GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1918             23A 
Thomas, scuttling with the crying infant through narrow streets past the back porches and the back stairs of the large old moldering antebellum houses... 
24    EXT. THE BACK OF AN OLD NEW ORLEANS HOUSE - NIGHT, 1918     24 
He comes to an old three-story house with a screened porch, VOICES from inside... PEOPLE TALKING and LAUGHING... The Baby, soothed by the soft yellow light, by the music of the voices, by the house itself -- stops its mournful cry. Thomas stops, catching his breath... He looks in through the back porch... the sounds of VOICES coming... Thomas quietly sets the baby on the back porch steps. He takes out every last dollar he has, tucking the money inside the Baby's blanket... We can just see the figures of two people coming from inside... Thomas knocks on the weathered screen door... And his decision made, he turns, moving away from the house, leaving his child behind. 
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) I could've sworn I heard somebody knockin'... 
When a young Black Woman, in a green dress, comes onto the porch... A thin, attractive woman, in her late 20s, with the sultry eyes of a lounge singer -- She's known as QUEENIE. She's followed by a handsome Black man, MR. WEATHERS -- that everyone calls TIZZY. She looks out the door, and not seeing anything... 
QUEENIE I guess not... 
She stands for a moment taking in the night air... 
QUEENIE (CONT'D) The air smells sweet... 
And she sings to herself... a song from the time... 
TIZZY You look very handsome tonight, Ms. Queenie, handsome as I ever seen you... The green matches your eyes... 
QUEENIE (fingering dress) It isn't everyday a war's over, Mr. Weathers... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED:                                                      24 QUEENIE (CONT'D) We have to mark it somehow... You ain't no slouch yourself. 
He smiles, tips his hat... And they stand in the quiet... 
TIZZY Hambert's back in town... came home legless, but he home... we're gonna throw a party for him... help get himself situated... (beat) I know you was sweet on him one time... 
QUEENIE Sweeter than I shoulda been... Lost his legs you say? "You never know what's comin' for you." 
And if right on cue an older white Woman sticks her head out... 
OLD WOMAN Ms. Simone messed herself... 
QUEENIE She got to stop doing that, or it's diapers for her... I'll be right there, Mrs. Jameson... 
The woman disappears inside.    Queenie, not anxious to go... 
QUEENIE (CONT'D) It sure is nice out here, Mr. Weathers... 
TIZZY Awful nice, Ms. Queenie... Come out back for a moment... take your mind away from things... 
He pushes open the porch screen door... 
QUEENIE (smiles) Just a moment's time... 
He offers her his hand... She takes it... He backs out of the house, holding her hand, and he suddenly steps right on top of the Baby... The baby wails, Tizzy stumbles, nearly falls... 
(CONTINUED) 
24   CONTINUED: (2)                                              24 
TIZZY What in God's name...?!! 
QUEENIE What is that?     A fish crawl out of the river...? 
She moves to it... pushes aside the blanket, and freezes. 
QUEENIE (CONT'D) God in heaven! 
IT IS THE VERY FIRST TIME WE HAVE SEEN THE BABY. What we see is the prominent bald head of any newborn... but it has the face, the wrinkled skin, the faded eyes, of an octogenarian. Indeed, if we didn't know any better, it would seem the newborn was a wrinkled decrepit sad-eyed old man... 
QUEENIE (CONT'D) My Goodness, the Lord did something here...! 
TIZZY Look like a milk wagon run over it... three times... and back... 
And they're both motionless, not quite sure what to do... 
TIZZY (CONT'D) I didn't see it layin' there... I hope I didn't hurt it none... steppin' on it like that... 
The BABY won't stop its mournful cry... 
TIZZY (CONT'D) We best leave it to the police... I'll go -- 
Queenie hesitates... a longing. 
QUEENIE It's for sure nobody wanted to keep it... 
And making up her mind, she suddenly grabs up the crying baby, taking it inside... Tizzy, anxiously whispering something, going in after her... 
Caroline shrugs.   She looks through the "book..." 
CAROLINE Some pages seem to be torn out here... 
She discovers inside... 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) There's an old streetcar token. 
She gives it to her mother, folding her hand around it. But Daisy is somewhere else, looking out the window... 
DAISY That clock... Just kept going, year after year after year... 
32   INT. "NEW" TRAIN STATION, NEW ORLEANS - ANOTHER DAY, 1925    32 
And we see "Mr. Cake's" clock with its cherubs pushing the "hands of progress," still marking time backwards... The year is now, "1925..." 
33   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - DINING ROOM, NEW ORLEANS -            33 EVENING, 1925 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "...I didn't know I was a child. I thought I was like everyone else who lived there, an old man, in my "golden years." 
The boarders eating dinner. Queenie, in a white uniform... along with Tizzy, wearing a chef's hat and apron, helping her serve. We move across the ancient faces... until we come to one particular face... Wearing eyeglasses now... but the same wrinkled face we've come to know... the face of a very old man... 
(CONTINUED) 
33   CONTINUED:                                                  33 
The face of Benjamin Button, when he should normally be a six-year-old. He's sitting in a wheelchair now... small, shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with arthritis... Eyeglasses are just one addition... a hearing aid... a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one ear... But if we look even closer we can see there are sprouts of hair... wisps of white... what would be the last hair for some... seem to be growing in... As we watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might, banging it just for the hell of it making noise... 
QUEENIE Stop bangin' that fork... (fixing it in his arthritic hand) It's for eating, not for playin' with... And use your napkin, please Mr. Benjamin... 
And he does as he's told... A staff member helps one of the old men, feeding him... Benjamin just another old man having dinner with his contemporaries. 
34   EXT. THE PORCH, NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1925      34 
A line of old people in rockers. Benjamin, like any six- year-old, bored, wheels his chair back and forth, between them... until one of the oldsters, who has had enough, sticks his cane in the spokes of his wheelchair, making him come to an abrupt stop... Benjamin, sitting with the other oldsters on the porch... the old people rocking... Sounds drift from the street beyond the wall... children playing... people talking... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON What's there? 
Nobody says anything, rocking. Benjamin, eternally curious needing to know, suddenly wheels himself precariously to the very edge of the porch where the wall is lower and he just sees the street... children running on the street, playing... carriages dropping people off for a party... He leans forward to get an even better view... When Queenie suddenly grabs him... 
QUEENIE Benjamin! That's dangerous... Come back here...! 
...Rolling his wheelchair away from the edge to the safety of the old people... out of sight of the street... 
35   INT. QUEENIE'S ROOM - NIGHT, 1925                            35 
The small room with the small window. We see Benjamin in a bed made on the floor... Queenie in her bed... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I loved her very much. She was my mother. 
And he reaches to hold her hand. She generously takes his hand... And they lay like that holding hands, Queenie in bed, her "son", the "old man" on the floor... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON Somedays I feel like I'm different from the day before... 
QUEENIE Everybody feels different about themselves one way or another. We're all goin' the same way, just taking different roads to get there... You're on your own road, Benjamin. 
BENJAMIN BUTTON How much longer do I have to live, Mother? 
QUEENIE Just be thankful you got what you're given. You already here longer than you supposed to be. 
We see the door quietly open, Tizzy coming in... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Some nights, I would have to sleep alone. 
He looks at Benjamin, his signal to pick him up, carrying him out of the room, sitting him in his wheelchair, Tizzy going back down into the room to be with Queenie... shutting the door... 
36   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE, LATE AT NIGHT, 1925            36 
An Old Woman's fallen fast asleep in an easy chair, a book on her lap. Benjamin sitting alone in his wheelchair, listening to the sounds of the house. 
(CONTINUED) 
36   CONTINUED:                                                        36 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I didn't mind. I would listen to the house breathing. All the people sleeping. I felt safe. 
Be he still wants to know "What's over there?" He wheels himself over to sit at the window looking outside... looking at the streetlights, the world beyond the gate... trying to see what's dangerous... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) It was a place of great routine... Every morning at 5:30, no matter the weather... General Winslow, U.S. Army Retired... raised the flag... 
37   EXT. THE FRONT LAWN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                  37 
And we see the very elderly General Winslow, doing just that... raising the flag in a downpour, only... he's naked. And as Queenie comes running across the lawn with a coat for him. There's the sound of SOMEONE SINGING OPERA... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON (V.O.) Mrs. Sybil Wagner, once a noted opera singer... well, she'd sing, Wagner... 
38   INT. MRS. WAGNER'S ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925              38 
We see a Victrola playing, Mrs. Wagner in her nightgown at a window singing with the musical accompaniment at the top of her lungs... while, down the hall we see Queenie giving Benjamin a bath... massaging his poor crippled legs... 
QUEENIE We're gonna put some life into these old sticks for you... get you walkin'... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Breakfast was served promptly at six. 
39   INT. THE KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - MORNING, 1925                     39 
We see Benjamin in his wheelchair, under Tizzy's tutelage, learning to cook... and simultaneously, to read... 
(CONTINUED) 
39   CONTINUED:                                            39 
TIZZY How we doin'?    What's that say there? 
BENJAMIN Bis... 
TIZZY Biscuits... and... 
BENJAMIN Graby... 
TIZZY Think. That's a 'v' not a 'b.' Say it. 
BENJAMIN Gravy. 
TIZZY Now you talkin'! 
Some staff come in getting platters of food... 
TIZZY (CONT'D) How many parts butter we got? 
BENJAMIN Four... 
TIZZY How many parts flour? 
BENJAMIN Two... 
TIZZY How much is four and two? 
BENJAMIN Six. 
Tizzy smacks the back of his head. 
TIZZY You're a regular addin' machine... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Dinner was served promptly at six. 
40   INT. KITCHEN, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1925                      40 
Tizzy washing dishes...Benjamin working with him... putting away cans... reading from one of the labels... 
And we see Benjamin coming into the kitchen... Tizzy busy preparing lunch... Benjamin stops, seeing a tiny African man, his back to us, surrounded by old people standing on the lawn... He hears him telling them... 
NGUNDA OTI ... My first wife and I are captured by neighbor tribe, cannibals... 
The old people shrink at the mention... 
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) I escaped across the river... 
AN OLD WOMAN (wide eyed) You escaped cannibals? 
NGUNDA OTI My wife, she can't swim, so she eaten. 
TIZZY (telling Benjamin) That's Mr. Oti... He's an acquaintance of an acquaintance of mine...he'll be stayin' with us in the staff quarters for awhile... 
NGUNDA OTI (telling old people) ...Second wife stepped on viper and dies... (jocular) It was bad luck to be married to Mr. Oti. 
They laugh. 
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) I am captured with six others by Baschiele tribe. They sell us to a big white man... 
He instinctively turns and sees Benjamin standing in the window watching him. When Mr. Oti spots him he quickly moves out of the window out of sight. 
47C   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER TIME, 1927            47C 
We see Benjamin lying on the floor by the stairs playing with some metal army men... when Mr. Oti's distinctive laugh, his voice, drifts up from under the stairs... Benjamin, getting his canes, goes to look... Mr. Oti, standing under the stairs in an alcove with some of the help, telling them his life story... but it's a completely different tone... a mockery of white people and their insanity... 
NGUNDA OTI The Big White Man brings us to St. Louis, where they make our village at the 1904 World's Fair... They have us livin' in these little huts like we're livin' in Africa... people behind bars staring at us... we told not to look at them... to just go about our normal lives... what the hell they talkin' about... ? 
They all laugh... 
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) At night we're done bein' "savages..." we go over the wall into The Rosebud... we drank and laughed until the sun come up... and then we savages again... 
They nod enjoying the idea... And as Mr. Oti senses Benjamin's presence, turning... Benjamin retreating on his canes as fast as he can back up the stairs... 
47D   INT. DINING ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY, 1927            47D 
Benjamin sitting at the dining room table reading an oversized book of "Imaginary Beings..." He senses a presence... and Mr. Oti sits down across from him. 
NGUNDA OTI I hear you not so old as you looking. You just foolin' everybody. What happen, you get Madjembe? 
(CONTINUED) 
47D   CONTINUED:                                                     47D 
BENJAMIN What's a madjembe? 
NGUNDA OTI Worms. 
BENJAMIN I don't think so. This is just how I am. 
Mr. Oti looks out at the street. 
NGUNDA OTI You want to get a cold root beer? 
BENJAMIN (an echo) It's dangerous. 
NGUNDA OTI Who said that? 
He gets up ready to go. Benjamin hesitates. He can see Queenie busy leaning out a window banging dust from a rug. 
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) (last chance) ...Come on little man... 
Despite knowing the consequences he takes up his canes and follows Ngunda outside... 
48    OMIT                                                            48 
49    EXT. STREET, OUTSIDE NOLAN HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1927       49 
They come outside. Children on the street playing. Seeing Benjamin, they come to a dead stop... staring at the freak from the old people's home, with another freak... Mr. Oti suddenly runs into the street... 
NGUNDA OTI Hurry... 
Benjamin tries as best he can to keep up... Mr. Oti darts directly in front of a street car, waving his arms, making it come to an abrupt stop... 
(CONTINUED) 
49    CONTINUED:                                                  49 
NGUNDA OTI (OVER) (CONT'D) ...Another white man come to my country and say he want to talk to me... 
50    INT. THE STREETCAR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1927                 50 
We move along the aisle of a streetcar... the various people... 
NGUNDA OTI Then I am in the monkey house at "Philadelphia Zoological Park." Three thousand people show up my first day... 
Benjamin and Ngunda siting in the back of the streetcar behind a moveable metal bar that has "Coloreds" painted on it... Mr. Oti taking a slug from a flask... A group of school children nearby can't take their eyes off the two of them... Mr. Oti takes his wallet out, taking out a folded piece of newspaper, showing it to Benjamin... "Bushman shares cage with park apes." 
BENJAMIN What's it like living in a cage? 
NGUNDA OTI It stinks. The monkeys, they do some tricks... I throw spear... I wrestle with Kowali, she is orangutan... They have me file my teeth like a cannibal... 
He shows him his teeth filed into points like a cannibal... 
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) When I'm not playing with monkeys - - they want me to run to bars in my cage with teeth to scare little children... 
And he suddenly jumps up and does just that, charging with his teeth bared at the school children... They scream... Mr. Oti, taking his seat again, laughs with Benjamin... 
50A   INT. (OR) EXT. THE STREETCAR, NEW ORLEANS - DAY             50A 
Benjamin, ecstatic, his head out the streetcar window, Mr. Oti holding onto the back of his breeches from falling... Benjamin feeling the wind and the city wash over him... 
51   EXT. THE PERISTYLE, NEW ORLEANS - PARK - END OF DAY, 1927   51 
Benjamin and Mr. Oti sitting on a bench at the peristyle of a park. Benjamin takes his first slug of a coca cola, taking too big a hit, the coke pouring out of his nose... Mr. Oti gives him a handkerchief... after he's wiped himself up... 
BENJAMIN Why didn't you go back home? 
NGUNDA OTI War between English and Dutch people had broken up kingdom. 
BENJAMIN What did you do? 
NGUNDA OTI I leave zoo. Go here. Go there. Everything okay. But I alone. 
BENJAMIN You were all alone? 
NGUNDA OTI You'll see little man, plenty times you be alone. You different like us, it's gonna be that way. But I tell you a little secret I find out. We know we alone. Fat people, skinny people, tall people, white people... they just as alone as us... But they scared shitless... 
He smiles a knowing smile... 
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) Not a thing wrong with being alone... no sir... 
He looks out... 
NGUNDA OTI (CONT'D) I think about the river I grew up on. It would be good to sit by my river again. 
He looks at his watch.   He suddenly gets up... 
34A. 
52   EXT. BOURBON STREET CORNER, NEW ORLEANS - DUSK, 1927         52 
Mr. Oti and Benjamin coming along the street, music pouring out... They reach a corner where a tall octoroon woman is waiting. She broadly smiles seeing Mr. Oti. 
THE WOMAN There's my little man. You ready, sugar.

59   INT. A ROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT, 1930                 59 
We see Benjamin asleep in bed with one of the Old Men, MR. DAWS. The door opens. And Daisy, in her nightgown, has come inside... she slightly touches Benjamin... 
DAISY (whispers) Are you sleeping? 
He shakes "no." 
DAISY (CONT'D) (whispers) Come on... 
She moves quickly out of the room and Benjamin gets up, and with the aid of his cane, follows her... 
60   INT. BACK STAIRWELL, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1930            60 
The old house still. Daisy, moving quietly down the stairs. Benjamin, his cane softly thumping the steps, following her. 
BENJAMIN (whispers) Where are we going? 
She doesn't say anything. She leads him into the DINING ROOM... where we see the wash has been draped, sheets and pillowcases, like ghosts over the dining room table, and a smaller side table, and a buffet...to dry... 
DAISY Under here... 
And she ducks under a sheet, beneath the dining table... Benjamin follows her into the "fort..." 
DAISY (CONT'D) Nobody knows about this but us. 
(CONTINUED) 
60   CONTINUED:                                                      60 
They sit... The little girl, and the old man with the maturity of a ten year old boy, enjoying their secret lair... She takes a candle out of the folds of her nightgown... She tries to light it, but doesn't really know how to use matches... 
DAISY (CONT'D) Will you light it? 
BENJAMIN I'm not supposed to use matches... 
DAISY Don't be chicken... 
Despite his caution, he lights the candle... the candlelight making it feel more secret... 
DAISY (CONT'D) I'll tell you a secret then you tell me one... (whispers) I saw mommy kissing another man. Her face was red from it. 
Benjamin doesn't know what to say. 
DAISY (CONT'D) Your turn to tell. 
BENJAMIN I'm younger than I look. 
DAISY (whispers) You don't seem like an old person... like my grandma... Are you sick? 
BENJAMIN (whispers) I heard Tizzy and my mother whisper. They said I was going to die soon. (smiles) But I fooled them so far. 
Daisy looks at him in the flickering candlelight. 
DAISY You are different than anybody I have ever met. Can I? 
(CONTINUED) 
60   CONTINUED: (2)                                               60 
She innocently reaches to touch the skin on his cheek to see what it feels like... When suddenly a sheet is pulled back and Daisy's grandmother is standing there. 
GRANDMA FULLER What are you doing under there? Who's idea was this candle? 
She angrily blows it out... and... to Daisy... taking her by the arm... 
GRANDMA FULLER (CONT'D) It's after midnight, you come right out here and get back up to bed...! (and for Benjamin, but saying it to Daisy) You are not to be playing together! Play with people your own age...! (moving her along) Now, you come back to bed, young lady...! You're too young to be wandering around in the night by yourself... (and a last word to Benjamin) You should be ashamed of yourself! 
And they're gone... Benjamin left sitting along under the sheets. There's a slight sound and he sees Queenie, in her nightgown, standing in the doorway... 
QUEENIE You are a different child... a man child. People aren't going to understand how different you are. 
BENJAMIN (forlorn) What's wrong with me, Mother? 
QUEENIE God hasn't said yet. Now, back to bed and behave yourself. 
He crosses up the back stairs with the aid of his cane, and Mr. Oti, like a spectre, is sitting on one end of the back steps smoking a cigarette, drinking form his flask. He looks at Benjamin as he goes by. 
(CONTINUED) 
60   CONTINUED: (3)                                               60 
NGUNDA OTI (takes a drink) You get used to it... 
QUEENIE (V.O.) (shouts) You get back in that bed or I'll cane your old ass! 
Benjamin turns down the hallway and slips into the bedroom -- 
61   INT. BEDROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - LATE NIGHT, 1930                 61 
Benjamin climbing back into bed with the Old Man. Turning his back to the old man. And Mr. Daws, unable to sleep... 
MR. DAWS Did I ever tell you I've been struck by lightning seven times. Once, when I was fixing a leak on the roof. 
And we see just that, the old man on a roof getting blasted. 
MR. DAWS (CONT'D) Once, when I was crossing the road to get the mail... 
And we see that, the man peacefully crossing a country road to get the mail, getting hit by lightning... But Benjamin just lays there looking out the window... all he can think about... despite everything... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I never forgot her blue eyes... 
62   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT           62 
The words linger. Daisy, her extraordinary blue eyes, lying on her death bed... the rattle of the window in the wind... 
CAROLINE Are you alright, Mother? 
She nods "yes." 
(CONTINUED) 
62   CONTINUED:                                                      62 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) This man. He loved you from the first time he saw you. 
She doesn't say anything. 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) (without complaint) Nobody has ever loved me that way. 
DAISY (impelling her) Go on. 
It's a rainy night. Benjamin, feeling like a million bucks, walks along the street, going home... A chauffeured car pulls alongside him, the window rolled down... And we see Thomas Button in the car... 
THOMAS BUTTON It's awful wet out. Can I offer you a ride somewhere...? 
BENJAMIN That's very kind of you, Sir. 
He gets into the car. 
80   INT. THOMAS' CAR, NEW ORLEANS - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932            80 
They drive in awkward silence. 
THOMAS BUTTON My name is Thomas, Thomas Button. 
BENJAMIN I'm Benjamin. 
THOMAS BUTTON (saying the name to himself) Benjamin... Yes, Benjamin... It's a pleasure to know you. 
They shake hands. 
(CONTINUED) 
80   CONTINUED:                                                        80 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Would you like to stop and have a drink, Benjamin? 
81   INT. BAR, FRENCH QUARTER - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932                    81 
A small old bar. Benjamin and his father sitting in the back... The waiter comes over, deferring to Benjamin's age... 
THE WAITER What will it be sir? 
BENJAMIN I'll have whatever he's having. 
THOMAS BUTTON A Sazerac for both of us...with whiskey instead of brandy... 
The waiter leaves. 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) You don't drink do you? 
BENJAMIN It's a night for firsts... 
THOMAS BUTTON How is that? 
BENJAMIN I've never been to a whore house either. 
THOMAS BUTTON It's an... experience... 
BENJAMIN It certainly is. (and honestly) I'm not very experienced about a lot of things. 
THOMAS BUTTON That isn't a bad thing. 
BENJAMIN There's a first time for everything. 
(CONTINUED) 
81   CONTINUED:                                                      81 
THOMAS BUTTON True enough. I don't mean to be rude... but your hands seem awful bent... It must be quite painful? 
BENJAMIN I don't really know what I have. I have some form of a disease. I have a lot of catching up to do. 
THOMAS BUTTON What kind of a disease? 
BENJAMIN I was born old. 
Thomas is quiet.    And for many things... 
THOMAS BUTTON I'm sorry. 
BENJAMIN (guileless) No need to be. Nothing wrong with old age. 
THOMAS BUTTON I'm sorry about your disease. 
BENJAMIN My mother says we're all born with something... 
THOMAS BUTTON Your mother? 
BENJAMIN I'm adopted. 
Thomas looks at him... They get their drinks... Tap glasses, and drink. Benjamin coughs at the taste... But forces it down... And as they laugh at his discomfort... 
82   INT. THE BAR - FRENCH QUARTER - LATER THAT NIGHT, 1932          82 
Thomas and Benjamin deep in conversation... and both of them more than a few sheets to the wind... Benjamin, particularly overblown like any first time drunk... 
THOMAS BUTTON ... My wife passed away many years ago... 
(CONTINUED) 
82   CONTINUED:                                                  82 
BENJAMIN (slurring) I'm very sorry. 
THOMAS BUTTON She died in childbirth. 
And there's a moment when it seems like Thomas might tell him, but despite the alcohol he thinks better of it... 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) (toasts, sadly) To children. 
BENJAMIN (nods, toasts) To mothers and fathers... 
After some moments: 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) What line of work are you in, Mr. Button? 
THOMAS BUTTON Buttons. "Button's Buttons." There isn't a button we don't make. Our biggest competition is B.F. Goodrich and his infernal zippers... 
The waiter comes over. 
THE WAITER Would you gentlemen like another? 
THOMAS BUTTON One more Benjamin? 
BENJAMIN If you'll let me pay for it, Mr. Button... 
He takes out a little of his hard earned pay... proud of himself... 
THOMAS BUTTON What kind of work do you do? 
BENJAMIN (proud of himself) I'm a tugboat man. 
83   EXT. NOLAN HOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT, 1932                         83 
The car's stopped outside the gate... Benjamin is drunkenly getting out... 
THOMAS BUTTON I enjoyed talking to you... 
BENJAMIN I enjoyed drinking with you... 
He starts to wobble inside... 
THOMAS BUTTON (after him) Benjamin... 
Benjamin slows... 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Would you mind, if time to time, I stopped by to say hello...? 
BENJAMIN (a drunken wave) Anytime.

Daisy stares at the window, the constant beating rain, the water running down the window... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Murmansk is on the Barrent Sea, the only ice-free ocean port in the Soviet Union... 
111   EXT. MURMANSK HARBOR, RUSSIA - DAY, 1941                    111 
We see "Chelsea" working with other tugs as snow falls in the crowded Russian Harbor. 
They tow a large freighter into port. 
CAPT. MIKE Benjamin... 
Benjamin, who is coiling rope on the bow, stands and looks at the Captain. 
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) (squinting down at him, wanting to know) Tell me how's it happen you showed up you were no bigger than a bollard. Now either I drink a helluva lot more than I think I do, or you sprouted... What's your secret? 
And Benjamin, tired of explanations, and what comes first to mind... 
BENJAMIN Well Captain, you do drink a lot... 
And that makes perfect sense to Mike... 
CAPT. MIKE (taking a drink, saluting) Goddamn right I do! 
And Benjamin stands on the bow... ready to see the world... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We stayed at a small hotel with the grand name, "The Winter Palace." 
74A. 
112   EXT. MURMANSK STREET, RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941                   112 
Snow covers the street outside of a turn-of-the Century hotel... a front window looks into its lobby... "The Winter Palace Hotel." 
113   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941                   113 
There's a packed BAR off the lobby... We see Benjamin sitting with Captain Mike, their crew, and a mixture of other seamen, Russians and other ethnics, all speaking different languages, sitting and standing around tables cluttered with bottles and glasses... Captain Mike, drunk, his shirt off, is telling a Russian sailor, another interpreting for him -- about a tattoo he has over his heart... an upside down hummingbird... 
CAPT. MIKE I saws this tattoo puts on a man's back in Singapore by Sakumoro, the greatest tattoo artist ever lived. I puts it on myself from mem'ry. 
And now we know why it's upside down... 
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) This idn't just anoter bird! Its heart rate's twelve hunerd beats a minute...! Its wings beats eighty times a second...! If you was to stop their wings from beatin, they would be dyin' in less than ten seconds...This is no ordinary bird, this is a frikkin' miracle! They slowed down the wings (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
113   CONTINUED:                                                      113 CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) wit' movin' pictures, you know what it showed, they wing tips are doin' dis... 
And he draws on a napkin a FIGURE EIGHT... 
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Does you know what the figure- eight is the mathematical symbol of...?! 
Pointing at the symbol... 
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) Infinity! 
And for some drunken reason, no matter what language they might speak, they all laugh... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Everybody, no matter what differences they had, the languages, the color of their skin, had one thing in common... they were drunk every single night... 
Then there's a shout -- and as if to underscore things, the Brody twins are kicking the shit out of each other again... 
114   INT. LOBBY, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941               114 
We see Benjamin waiting for the small caged elevator to take him to his room. He gets in, the elevator operator about to shut the grill door... 
A WOMAN'S (V.O.) Would you wait, please... 
And we see a WOMAN in her late 40s... getting on the elevator... Benjamin looks over at her... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Her name was Elizabeth Abbott. She was not beautiful. She was plain as paper... But she was as pretty as any picture to me... 
"Plain as paper," ELIZABETH ABBOTT... Directly behind her walks a tall, tired man, in his 50s... By the look of his ruddy face, and her silent mien... they're both drunk... Benjamin finds himself looking at her... 
(CONTINUED) 
114   CONTINUED:                                                  114 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT What are you looking at? 
She has a distinctly English accent. Benjamin doesn't say a word. 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) If you must know, we have a long standing agreement never to go to bed sober. Isn't that right darling? 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Her husband was Walter Abbott...He was Chief Minister of the British Trade Mission in Murmansk... and he was a spy... 
They ride up. Elizabeth has her shoes off...She sees him noting her stocking feet... The elevator finally rattles to a stop, and George and Elizabeth get off... Starting down the hall...she abruptly turns to say to Benjamin... so that it's completely understood... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I broke the heel off of one of my shoes...I don't usually walk around in my bare feet... 
And as he watches her saunter along the hallway... the way drunks do... endeavoring to keep her dignity... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) They were long days there... 
115   EXT. MURMANSK HARBOR, RUSSIA - DAY, 1941                    115 
Benjamin on the tug, but it's less fun now, not much adventure, just hard work... Fighting the snow and the wind, they tow a large freighter into port... 
76A. 
116   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM - "WINTER PALACE" - NIGHT, 1941        116 
Benjamin, in his small room, cold air blasting through the windows, looking out the window into the snowy night... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And longer nights... 
He lays on his bed looking out at the dark sky... the snow falling...

116   CONTINUED:                                                     116 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) One particular night... when I was having trouble sleeping... 
117   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - LATE NIGHT, 1941                117 
Benjamin trudges down the stairs, stepping tentatively into the empty lobby... He slows, seeing ELIZABETH ABBOTT in her bathrobe, sitting, alone and lonely... and it's not the first time for her... 
BENJAMIN I'm sorry... I can't sleep... 
She's quiet... She finally looks up... but doesn't say anything... There's an awkward moment...exacerbated by the stillness of the hotel in the middle of the night... 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I was going to make some tea...would you like some? 
She shakes her head no... He crosses through the empty bar, into an old KITCHEN... He looks for tea... Puts water in a kettle... As he watches the kettle boil... Elizabeth, her arms folded across her chest as if she were chilled, stands by the door... Benjamin, without asking, takes a cup for her... 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Milk...? Honey...? 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Some honey, thank you. 
He finds a large honey jar... and seeing some dead flies in with the sweet syrup he asks... 
BENJAMIN Do you like flies with your tea? 
She smiles...for the first time... A thin smile... He starts to stir the tea... Elizabeth stopping him... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT You must let it steep for a minute... 
123   INT. DINING ROOM, "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - NIGHT, 1941         123 
Benjamin and Elizabeth in the empty dining room at a table with a white tablecloth... with some wine and cheese... She's laughing now, measurably loosened up... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT He started to take his pants off... I'm afraid he misread me completely... 
He laughs. She looks through her wine glass at him... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Do you notice how people look better through a wine glass... 
He holds his up.... looking at her....She moves her glass just looking at him... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) You're a good looking man with or without a wine glass... 
She picks at the tablecloth with her finger next to his... She puts her finger over his making a cross... 
(CONTINUED) 
123   CONTINUED:                                                  123 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) We are all just crossing in the night. Sometimes we intersect. 
She leaves her finger there for a moment... lingering... She abruptly moves it away... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) I should go to bed... he'll be up soon. 
She hesitates... And she kisses him, and then hurries out of the dining room... As Benjamin sits in the empty dining room... the kiss left on his lips... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It was the first time a woman had ever kissed me. It's something you never forget. 
124   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT          124 
The wind and rain knocking at the window. Daisy silently lying in bed. 
CAROLINE Are you upset, Mother? 
She doesn't say anything. Caroline, seeing her feet have come out of the covers, caring, fixes her blanket. 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Would you like some socks? 
Daisy's quiet. 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Do you want me to stop reading? 
Daisy's answer for her is... 
DAISY It must have been very cold. I'm glad he had somebody to keep him warm. 
Which Caroline takes as her cue to read on... 
CAROLINE (after a beat, reading) "I couldn't wait to see her again." 
83A. 
125   INT. "WINTER PALACE," RUSSIA - ANOTHER LATE NIGHT, 1941     125

BENJAMIN (self-conscious) I'm not dressed -- 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT You're delicious just as you are... 
She laughs, taking his arm, walking to the dining room as if going to dinner... They sit at a table... which she has set for them... Caviar and Vodka... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Don't bother with the cheese or the wine here, they're quite common... but the caviar and the vodka are plentiful and sublime... 
She feeds him a spoonful of the caviar...Unaccustomed to it, he swallows it too quickly... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Take your time... If you eat it all at once there will be nothing left to enjoy... savor it... 
She gives him another spoonful... and takes one herself... He takes his time... They both do... savoring it... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) (pouring) Now, a swallow of vodka... 
Which they do... She laughs... Looking at him... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) You haven't been with many women have you? 
BENJAMIN No. Not many. At least none on a Sunday. 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (smiles) I feel like I'm with a virgin. 
She's not far off... And it's a lovely thought... and it makes her think of her youth.

And we see just that....Young Elizabeth, in goggles, her body covered with grease, swimming with two escort boats across the English Channel. 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) The current was so strong...that for every stroke I took... I was pushed two strokes back... 
And we see just that, Elizabeth fighting the current... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) I swam for 32 hours... I was only two miles from the French shore... 
Elizabeth in sight of the lights of Calais...

And it starts to rain on her... Harder and harder... the shore is suddenly gone from sight... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) When I couldn't go any further, and I just stopped... 
And we see her being taken onto a boat, a blanket wrapped around her... 
127   EXT. CALAIS, BEACH - NIGHT, 1911                            127 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT'S (V.O.) They asked me whether I would try again...? 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT Why wouldn't I? 
She smiles, a young girl, full of life... 
128   INT. DINING ROOM - "WINTER PALACE" - LATE NIGHT, 1941        128 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT I never did. As a matter of fact, I have never done much of anything with my life after that... 
And it's quiet. She touches his rough hand. 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) Your hands are very rough... you have grease under your nails... 
She runs her fingernail along his face... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) I can feel the wind on your face... 
They look at each other. And this time, Benjamin kisses her. It lingers... She stops herself... 
ELIZABETH ABBOTT (CONT'D) I'm afraid it's the witching hour... 
She quickly gets up... And she's gone. As Benjamin sits in the empty dining room. 
139   INT. BENJAMIN'S ROOM, "WINTER PALACE" LATER, 1941               139 
Benjamin unlocking the door to his room. An ENVELOPE has been left under the door, he opens it. 
BENJAMIN'S (V.O.) She had left a note. She wrote, "it was nice to have met you." That was it. 
And as he stands holding the letter in his room at the small Russian hotel: 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And so, I went to war. 
140   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN, SOMEWHERE - NIGHT, 1941           140 
The men on the tug on a dark gray sea.... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It wasn't the war we expected. We would tow crippled ships... scraps of metal... (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
140   CONTINUED:                                                     140 BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) across the high seas... If there was a war, we didn't see it... 
And what seemed exciting, the idea of war... is tedious... The "Chelsea" towing a strange hulking shape on the dark, empty sea... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) There was a man assigned with us... The Chief Gunner loved the Navy, and most of all, he loved America. 
THE MAN'S (V.O.) There is no other country in the world...! When YOU spell America, A.M.E.R.I.C.A. You're spelling freedom...! 
We see the young Gunnery Mate, no more than nineteen... sitting at his post on a high caliber machine gun... ready to kick some enemy ass... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) His name was Dennis Smith and he was a full blooded Cherokee... His family had been in America for over five hundred years. 
DENNIS SMITH You have these pacifists. They say they won't fight on conscience. Where would we be if everybody decided to act according to their conscience? 
CAPT. MIKE (out his Window) Keeps it down, would you chief! 
He goes back inside... And as they settle into their tasks.. 
DENNIS SMITH (on his gun, to himself, the last word) Where else can you shoot white people and get away with it... 
Benjamin's the only one around to hear him... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I worked in the kitchen... 
141   INT. THE TUGBOAT KITCHEN - DAY, 1941                         141 
Benjamin busy preparing a meal in the galley kitchen. The Perpetually silent Pleasant Curtis, on kitchen duty, helping him with the preparation... while they work... 
BENJAMIN (trying to make conversation) You're from the Kentucky mountains aren't you? It must be pretty there.. 
Pleasant Curtis doesn't say a word. Benjamin shrugging, puts the pie in an oven. 
142   INT. THE GALLEY - TUGBOAT - NIGHT                            142 
The men; including Dennis Smith, Pleasant Curtis, John Grimm, the "fighting" Brody twins, Benjamin serving them, silently eating dinner, rolling with endless rolling Ocean. Pleasant, not interested, just gets up and leaves. 
JOHN GRIMM There's something not normal about him. 
As they silently eat, mostly bored... 
DENNIS SMITH (looking outside) Whoever said "War is hell," doesn't know shit from shinola. 
143   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN -- ANOTHER NIGHT, 1942          143 
We see "Chelsea," a steel tow line splayed out from its winch, towing a large crippled freighter across the ocean... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We were towing a British freighter, that had gone dead in the water, 800 miles to Halifax for repair... 
We see Benjamin and the crew watching the ship on the tow line run out some thousand feet behind them... 
144   INT. CREW QUARTER, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942     144 
We see Benjamin awake in his bunk, Dennis Smith asleep in the bunk above him. 
(CONTINUED) 
144   CONTINUED:                                                     144 
Pleasant Curtis seemingly asleep in his bunk below him... Benjamin looking out at the black sea... and out of the silence Pleasant Curtis for the first time speaks... 
PLEASANT CURTIS I've been watching you. You seem trustworthy. If something happens to me... could you see this gets to my wife...? 
He hands Benjamin a folded up handkerchief... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) He had given me all of his pay... he hadn't spent a dime of it... 
PLEASANT CURTIS If anything happens I want my family to know I was thinking about them, and if I could have, I'd have come back home. 
And that said he turns back over... And as Benjamin looks at the dark foreboding sea... suddenly: 
CAPT. MIKE (OVER) (calls) All hands on deck!!! 
They bolt from their bunks... Going outside... 
145   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     145 
Captain Mike stands by the wheelhouse... silently looking at the ocean... They see bodies of men, dead men, floating by them... One and two at first... then three and four... and then more and more until they are moving through a carpet of bodies... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) The war found us. 
As they move through the water... their propeller literally chopping up bodies, to where they have to veritably shut their engines down... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) A transport carrying 900 men had been hit by a torpedo. We were first to arrive at the scene... 
And as the tug arrives at the scene we see a TRANSPORT VESSEL, with a gaping hole in its midships sinking quickly... Fuel oil burning on the water... (CONTINUED) 
145   CONTINUED:                                                      145 
It's then we see the true horror of the men in the water... in the burning black oil... The transport boat silently slips into the water, disappearing under the sea... 
146   EXT. TUGBOAT - ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                     146 
As the tug moves through the thick black smoke... Benjamin and the other crewmen watching along the rails... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) There wasn't a sound... 
Except for the   lapping of water, and the tugboat's engines, there   isn't... just the silence of death... Something else   appears, doming onto the surface like a spectre... the   U-BOAT that had reeked this havoc... looking to see   the results... Captain Mike sees the sub... 
CAPT. MIKE (mad as hell) We can't run from the fucker and we can't hide...! There's only one thing we can do...! (and he shouts) Battle Stations...!!! 
They run to their battle stations... 
147   INT. PILOT HOUSE, TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942         147 
Captain Mike at the wheel in the pilot house, turning the tug, furiously bearing down on the surfaced submarine... 
148   EXT. TUGBOAT, ATLANTIC OCEAN - NIGHT, 1942                      148 
A German submariner, on the conning tower, seeing the Tugboat, turns the .50 caliber machine gun on the tugboat... Benjamin is grazed by a bullet, his forehead cut open, bleeding... Despite the strafing the tug is relentless... The submarine, seeing it is about to be rammed tries to dive... but it's too late... the tugboat ramming the submarine... severing the U-Boat in half. The concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in the sinking submarine's torpedo shaft, the torpedo exploding, bursting the submarine, and in the process, blasting away under the stern of the tugboat... the men on the stern blown to pieces... Benjamin's literally thrown against the wheel house... He manages to get to his feet, the tug listing, beginning to sink... There's a man's voice... 
(CONTINUED) 
148   CONTINUED:                                                     148 
And he sees, Captain Mike riddled with bullets, his body covered with blood... Benjamin bends to him... Captain Mike trembling as he lays dying... 
CAPT. MIKE Look at what they did! They shot holes in me! They shots the hell out my paintin'! 
His body, his tattoos, like a ripped canvas, is riddled... 
CAPT. MIKE (CONT'D) You've seen a lot of things. Tell me it's going to be alright. 
BENJAMIN You're going to heaven Captain Mike. You're going to heaven. 
155   INT. THE PARLOR, NOLAN HOUSE - NIGHT, 1945                    155 
We see Mr. Daws, much older now, asleep in an easy chair. 
(CONTINUED) 
155   CONTINUED:                                                     155 
Benjamin standing at the familiar window, listening to the silence of the house... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It's a funny thing about coming home. Smells the same. Looks the same. Feels the same. 
Mr. Daws awakens.    Seeing Benjamin.   As if he never left. 
MR. DAWS Did I ever tell you I've been struck by lightning seven times. Once I was sitting in my truck listening to the radio. 
And we see just that Mr. Daws sitting in his truck getting belted by lightning. 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) You realize what's changed, is you... 
While Benjamin stands locking out the window: 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) And one evening, not long after I had been back... 
156   INT. THE NOLAN HOUSE - EARLY ONE EVENING, 1945                 156 
We see Benjamin, coming down the stairs. He happens to glance out a casement window... He slows... He can just see part of a TAXI coming to stop at the gate. He moves to the next landing...where he can see a figure is getting out of the cab... The figure of a young woman, wearing a beret, a dark coat and lace up boots... She strides through the gate... It takes us a moment to recognize her... the leggy thirteen year old girl is gone... replaced by a confident woman in her early twenties... with her red hair and her blue eyes she could be no one else but DAISY. Benjamin follows her progress, moving through the parlor, watching her out the screened windows... She moves gracefully past the porch with its swings... The unnamed woman's old dog, smelling her, comes to greet her... Daisy going around to the back of the house... Benjamin moving to the back door, and just as Daisy starts to knock... Benjamin opening it... Momentarily startled, she doesn't recognize him.... and asks... 
(CONTINUED) 
156   CONTINUED:                                                      156 
DAISY Oh, excuse me... is Queenie here...? 
BENJAMIN Daisy... it's me, Benjamin. 
She hardly can believe her eyes... 
DAISY Benjamin...Oh my God it's you... Of course it's you... 
They embrace, and there's a moment when the touch is not just of old friends, but something different... and they both, in that moment recognize that things will never be the same... Daisy, over-hugging him... the way young people do... 
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin, how are you? It's been such a long time... There's so much I want to know... When did you come back? 
BENJAMIN Just a few weeks ago... 
DAISY I spoke to Queenie...she told me you were in the war...somewhere at sea... I was so worried about you... 
BENJAMIN (simply) I'm okay. 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) When I had left she was a girl... and a woman had taken her place... 
BENJAMIN I can't get over you -- You are so lovely... 
DAISY You stopped writing. 
BENJAMIN I feel terrible about it... (smiles) (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
156   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 156 BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Now that I see you I feel even worse... Look at you...Daisy Fuller... 
157   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT             157 
Daisy's still. She touches her old face. 
DAISY ...Beautiful. 
CAROLINE He said, "The most beautiful," Mother. 
DAISY What else did he say about... 
CAROLINE He said... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "...Everything, in that moment, had changed between us..." 
158   INT. BACK STAIRS, NOLAN HOUSE - TWILIGHT, 1945                 158 
Benjamin and Daisy going up the back stairs... 
DAISY I can't get over you're home... I've been planning to come by for awhile... my grandmother, you remember Grandma Fuller... of course you remember her... she passed away... 
BENJAMIN I heard that... I'm sorry... 
DAISY I've been wanting to get some of her things... 
...They go into her grandmother's room... 
159   INT. GRANDMA FULLER'S ROOM - TWILIGHT, 1945                    159 
Her grandmother's things are in boxes neatly stacked in a corner, waiting to be taken away... Daisy starts to go through them... Benjamin gives her a hand... As they go through things... 
(CONTINUED) 
159   CONTINUED:                                                      159 
DAISY I can't believe I open the door, and you're actually standing there...It must be fate... What do they call it, "Kismet"? I read a book about a man named Edgar Cayce, a psychic, everything is predetermined...I like to think it's fate. What do you think, Benjamin? 
BENJAMIN I don't know how it works, but I'm sure glad it happened... 
They inadvertently touch... the electricity of friction... both aware of the closeness... they move ever so slightly apart... 
DAISY (nervously) Have you been to New York...? It's just across the bridge from me... I can actually see the Empire State Building if I stand on my bed... Where have you been? Tell me everything. The last time you wrote you said you were in Russia? I always wanted to go to Russia... Is it as cold as they say...? You wrote you met somebody... did it work out...? 
BENJAMIN (holding out) Remember this? 
He's comes upon the BOOK her grandmother had read to them, Rudyard Kipling's "Just So." She sits on the bed... Benjamin sitting beside her... the two shoulder to shoulder... Daisy looking through the book... and reading.... 
DAISY ...This is the picture of Old Man Kangaroo at five in the afternoon..." 
She looks at him. 
(CONTINUED) 
159   CONTINUED: (2)                                              159 
DAISY (CONT'D) You don't look like an old man anymore...You always said you were different... I think you must be... 
He doesn't say anything. The two of them sitting with their backs to us like the old friends they are...They touch... acutely aware of their proximity and before it can go any further... 
BENJAMIN Are you hungry? Would you like to get something to eat? 
DAISY I would love that... 
And the moment's gone... 
160   EXT. A NEW ORLEANS STREET - NIGHT                           160 
...And we see a taxi door being opened in slow motion... and Daisy, dressed for the night, glides out... a man helping her... and we see Benjamin a step behind getting out of the car... dressed to the nines... hair slicked, elegant... but nonetheless, a step behind... And we hear Daisy's voice, from somewhere else... 
DAISY'S (V.0.) ...I danced for a man named Ballenchine...He's a famous choreographer. He said I had a perfect line. They asked Ballenchine to describe what he did. He said, "I'm a carpenter." Isn't that amazing? In one of his rehearsals a dancer fell. He put it into the production. Can you imagine that in a classical ballet? A dancer intentionally falling? He isn't the only one, Agnes DeMille, Lincoln Kirstein, Richard Pleasant, Lucia Chase...There's a whole new word for dance now, it's called abstract..." 
The door to the restaurant held open for Daisy... another man showing her inside... Benjamin forgotten for the slightest of moments at the door... going after her. 
161   INT. NEW ORLEANS RESTAURANT - NIGHT, 1945                    161 
A crowded New Orleans restaurant. Daisy as a maitre d in slow motion is showing her to a table... Men's, and even women's, eyes following her... 
DAISY'S (V.0.) ...They have torn up all the conventions... the straight up and down style, all the things that bound dancers...It's not about the formality of the dance...the classical structure...it's about what the dancer's feeling...there are no rules; the movement can be tense or relaxed, abrupt or flowing, carefree or somber, it may suggest love or hate, attraction or repulsion. The unexpected shifts of weight or energy -- not just to shock but to reinvent tradition...putting the familiar form to new and unexpected uses. It's so basic Just you alone with your body... 
And as he quietly looks at himself... There's a KNOCK on the door.. 
A MAN'S (V.0.) Benjamin... 
He puts something on, and opens the door. And as if to underscore what he's just said, he sees THOMAS BUTTON in his fifties himself now, leaning on crutches, his feet bandaged, standing in the doorway... 
THOMAS BUTTON Hello, Benjamin... Do you remember me? 
BENJAMIN Of course, Mr. Button... What happened to you? 
THOMAS BUTTON My foot was infected... I'm afraid they had to remove it... (beat, without irony) Welcome home, my friend. 
165   INT. DELMONICO'S STEAK HOUSE, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1945         165 
The bar and restaurant crowded with men, many with various kinds of handicaps from the war, drinking away their demons... And we see Benjamin and Thomas sitting at a table... thick steaks, baked potatoes, drinks at their elbows... 
BENJAMIN You're still drinking Sazerac with whiskey instead of brandy. 
THOMAS BUTTON I'm a man of habit. 
(CONTINUED) 
165   CONTINUED:                                                        165 
BENJAMIN (smiles) Are you still visiting the house on Bourbon street? 
THOMAS BUTTON (smiles) Not for a long time. 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I told him about my life... about my time at war... and he told me how he had devoted his business to making buttons for the war effort... 
THOMAS BUTTON The war has been kind to the button industry... we had gone from making forty thousand buttons a day to making two hundred and fifty thousand... We employed ten times the number of workers... We were operating around the clock... 
And he quiets... the sound of the busy restaurant... And after some moments Thomas tells him... 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I don't know how much longer I have to live... 
BENJAMIN I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Button. 
And it seems like he is about to tell Benjamin the entire truth... but he can't bring himself and instead... 
THOMAS BUTTON I don't have any people. I keep to myself. I -- I'm frightened. I hope you won't mind... but whenever it's possible... I would enjoy your company... 
BENJAMIN I'll do what I can, Mr. Button. 
They quietly eat. 
(CONTINUED) 
165   CONTINUED: (2)                                                 165 
THOMAS BUTTON (after a beat) Tell me Benjamin, do you know anything about buttons? 
BENJAMIN Just what holds my shirt on. 
166   EXT. BUTTON FACTORY, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1945                 166 
An old brick building with a painting on its side of a woman sewing on a button... "Button's Buttons." A driver waits outside of a "town car". 
167   INT. BUTTON FACTORY, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1945                 167 
We see Thomas unlocking a door. 
THOMAS BUTTON (has been telling him) ... comes from the French, "bouton," meaning a bud, or any round object... 
They come into a corridor. Thomas unlocking another door. 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) They were originally decorative, jewelry sewn on clothing... 
168   INT. WORK FLOOR, BUTTON FACTORY - NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT          168 
They walk through the quiet factory... 
THOMAS BUTTON The practice of buttoning originated in the 13th century... when baggy clothing was replaced with more form-fitting clothes... 
Thomas, on his crutches...past the lines of work benches... Mannequins in uniforms of the armed services... with their various gold and silver buttons... 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Button's Buttons has been in our family for one hundred and twenty- four years. My grandfather was a tailor. He had a small shop in Richmond. After the Civil War he came to New Orleans. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
168   CONTINUED:                                               168 THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) My father saw the wisdom of making our own buttons. The tailor shop grew to this... And today... (a smile) I can't sew a stitch. 
Benjamin is interested, but the obvious question is... 
BENJAMIN It's all very interesting.   But what do you want from me? 
THOMAS BUTTON I said, our family has been in the business for a hundred and twenty- four years. 
BENJAMIN Our family? 
And it's as if he has opened a flood gate... 
THOMAS BUTTON You are my family. Benjamin, you are my son. 
And tears run down his anguished face... Benjamin's still... 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I am so sorry not to have told you before... 
Benjamin hasn't moved. The words ring in his ears. 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) You were born the night the great war ended... Your mother died giving birth to you... I thought... I thought you were a monster... I left you on the back steps of a house... I promised your mother I'd make sure you were safe... I should never have abandoned you... 
Benjamin's dead quiet... He looks at this man, his father... 
BENJAMIN My mother? 
169   INT. THE BUTTON HOUSE, THE GARDEN DISTRICT - NIGHT, 1945       169 
We see Benjamin and Thomas in a hallway leading to the kitchen of the large house... The hallway filled with: photographs of the Button Family. Thomas pointing out relatives... Family photographs... 
THOMAS BUTTON ...A great uncle, from Germany. (and a group picture) All of the men in the family at the Lake House... (notices the date on it) 1915, three years before you were born. 
A photograph of an old man sitting in a wooden deck chair on the dock of a lake. 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) Your grandfather at the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain. When I was a boy I would love to wake up before anybody else and run down to the lake to watch the day begin. It was as if I was the only one alive. 
And they've come to a young Woman's photograph... who could only be Benjamin's mother. He stops... 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I fell in love with her the first time I saw her. (beat) Your mother's name was Caroline Murphy. She was 20. She worked in your grandfather's kitchen...She was from Dublin... Her father, your maternal grandfather, was a chimney sweep... He died in the flu epidemic of 1900... Caroline came with her mother, two sisters, and four brothers in 1903 to live in New Orleans. 
They stop at the kitchen door. 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) I would find reasons to go to the kitchen... just to look at her... 
(CONTINUED) 
169   CONTINUED:                                                  169 
He does just that... Looking through the round window into the empty kitchen... as if she was there those years ago... as if she was still there... 
THOMAS BUTTON (CONT'D) The happiest day of my life was April 25th, 1918 the day I married your mother. 
They move along the hallway... Benjamin looking at the photographs... his bloodlines... After some moments: 
BENJAMIN Why didn't you tell me? 
THOMAS BUTTON I made a mistake. 
Benjamin looks at him. 
They're literally dumbfounded. 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) Mrs. Sanderson will explain how everything works and will answer any of your questions... 
And with that he turns, walking away...Having "given away the store"... the workers in disbelief looking up at him... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And I went to New York. 
179   EXT. NEW YORK CITY -- NIGHT, 1947                           179 
We see a cab pull up and Benjamin, in a nice suit, flowers in hand, daisies, gets out, hurrying into The Majestic Theater, the marquee telling us "CAROUSEL," is performing. 
180   INT. THE MAJESTIC THEATER, NYC - NIGHT, 1947                180 
Benjamin, coming in late, being shown to his seat. And we see the production of Rodgers and Hammerstein's musical "Carousel," with Mielziner's seminal stage design, as choreographed by Agnes De Mille... And we see the dancer is Daisy...dancing with the man of her dreams, the "bad boy" carnival barker... while Benjamin watches her. 
181   INT. BACKSTAGE, THE MAJESTIC THEATER - NYC - NIGHT, 1947     181 
We see Benjamin, flowers in hand, making his way through a crowded backstage corridor filled with friends and well- wishers giving cast members congratulations. He comes to the door... to the attention of a STAGEHAND... 
BENJAMIN I'm a friend of Daisy's... 
The man matter-of-factly opens the door... A dressing room crowded with dancers changing out of their Costumes... He calls out... 
THE MAN Daisy has company... 
We can hear Daisy's name being said...Benjamin waiting... He sees Daisy, in a robe, coming through the room.... 
DAISY Somebody's looking for me?... 
...And she sees it's Benjamin. And rather than excited to see him... She's startled he's there... and not altogether pleased about him showing up... 
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin... What are you doing here? 
And he realizes, as most of us have in one love affair or another, whatever his expectations may have been, his fantasy, is not the reality... 
BENJAMIN I thought I'd come visit... spend some time with you if I could... 
DAISY I wish you would have called... You caught me by surprise. 
He gives her the flowers, the daisies. 
BENJAMIN I couldn't take my eyes off of you... you were mesmerizing... 
DAISY That's so nice of you to say... These are lovely... Thank you...

There's an awkward moment... and... 
DAISY (CONT'D) I better get changed... a group of us are going to a party... would you like to come...? 
BENJAMIN Somebody told me about a restaurant I thought you might enjoy... I made a reservation... Just in case -- 
DAISY (awkwardly) ...all the dancers go out together after the show... You're welcome to come with us... There'll be all sorts of interesting people... Let me get changed. 
And she runs back inside the dressing room... Benjamin left to stand in the hallway.... 
182   INT. A NEW YORK LOFT - NIGHT, 1947                              182 
A loft elevator opens depositing Benjamin and Daisy along with a bunch of people into a large loft... crowded with her friends, dancers and show people, musicians, predominantly young people, straight and gay, beatniks before there were beatniks, bohemians... Music playing... People pressed together, having to shout to talk... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And I met her friends... 
DAISY I'll get you a drink... 
As she turns to a kitchen to get him a drink, she is startled as a young man, DAVID, suddenly grabs her, kissing her, a kiss that's not intended to be platonic... Daisy obviously involved with him... but embarrassed by the intimacy in front of Benjamin and not wanting to hurt his feelings... she pulls awkwardly away from him... 
DAISY (CONT'D) This is my friend David... David dances with our company too... This is the man I've told you about, Benjamin... 
They shake hands... Daisy, wanting to escape. 
(CONTINUED) 
182   CONTINUED:                                                      182 
DAISY (CONT'D) I'll get you that drink. - - 
...she goes into the kitchen... 
DAVID You were her grandmother's friend or something like that...? 
BENJAMIN Something like that. 
And Daisy comes back out with a drink for him... and one of her own... But before she can give him his drink, a woman takes it from her... and starts to dance with her... but not with her... the way dancers do... and many of the dancers are dancing just because they feel like it... David, comes to dance with Daisy... Benjamin standing watching Daisy dancing with him... as only dancers can... in complete control of their bodies and yet totally uninhibited... Benjamin sees David kiss her... and his jealousy getting the best of him, he turns and leaves... 
183   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT              183 
Daisy in her turban... listening to Caroline read..

Benjamin on his way out of the apartment coming along the street. Daisy running after him... 
DAISY I did what you told me to... enjoy my life... I'm only going to be young once... I had no idea you were coming. What did you think I was going to do...? You can't expect me to just drop everything, Benjamin... this is my life... 
And we see DAVID and a group of her dancer friends have come outside down the way into the street... looking for cabs... 
(CONTINUED) 
184   CONTINUED:                                                      184 
DAVID (to Daisy) There's a party downtown we're going to... 
DAISY (conflicted, to Benjamin) Why don't you come with us, Benjamin... There'll be a lot of musicians, interesting people there.... You'll have a good time... 
BENJAMIN I came here to tell you I made a mistake before...A day doesn't go by that I don't regret it...It's not the way I felt...I should have never let you go...I came because I hoped I could be with you... 
DAVID Daisy, you going to come...? 
Cabs have pulled up... She's torn... between her life and some other life... Benjamin, recognizing her conflict... 
BENJAMIN Do you love him?

He turns to go... she's motionless, caught between the two worlds... And we expect her to yell after him, to stop him... But instead, she does what we all do in these moments, what feels good at the time... She runs to be with her friends... She gets into a taxi... The cab drives by him as they leave... Daisy turned to look out the back window... looking back at him... He waves... letting her go... And another chance for them is missed... The street's quiet. And hands in his pockets, a middle-aged man going on 26... he walks off into the night... 
Daisy getting dressed...

And we see the taxi turning the corner, driving safely by them... and becoming a ghost... of what might have been... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) (CONT'D) But life being what it is... a series of intersecting lives and incidents... Out of anyone's control... the taxi did not go by... and the driver momentarily was distracted... 
The Driver wipes cigarette ash from his shirt front momentarily looking down...

196   INT. A HOSPITAL ROOM, PARIS, FRANCE - DAY, 1954               196 
We see Benjamin coming into the hospital room in France...Daisy, fully immobilized, lying in a hospital bed... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And her leg was crushed... 
She's still, her eyes closed. Sensing him, she stirs. And then she sees him. 
BENJAMIN Hello, Daisy... 
DAISY Who told you? 
BENJAMIN Your friend wired me. 
DAISY That was very kind of you... to come all the way here, to see that I was alright. 
BENJAMIN You would have done the same for me... 
And her first reaction, to how young he is... 
DAISY My God, look at you. You're perfect.... 
Which she isn't... She's quiet, and she suddenly says:

DAISY (CONT'D) I wish you hadn't. I wish you hadn't come here. 
He's dead still. 
DAISY (CONT'D) I don't want you to see me like this... 
She turns over... as if she didn't see him he wouldn't be there... Before he can say anything... A Nurse comes in saying something in French... She pulls the curtains around the bed... Benjamin waits... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) Her leg had been broken in five places.... and with therapy, and time, she might be able to stand...maybe even walk... 
The Nurse leaves... Benjamin comes into the circle of curtains... It's reminiscent of when they sat under the table... the sheets over them... in their private world... But this time she lays in the hospital bed her back to him... 
BENJAMIN I'll get a room... and once you can leave you'll come home with me to New Orleans. Where you can be with people who love you. 
She suddenly turns... 
DAISY What home? Who's we? I'm not going back to New Orleans. New Orleans is your home... I don't have a home... I haven't been home for five years... I'm not going anywhere with you... 
BENJAMIN Alright, I'll stay here in Paris... I'll help you with anything you need... 
DAISY Benjamin...! I know I'm feeling sorry for myself... But it wasn't supposed to be like this... (MORE)

196    CONTINUED: (2)                                            196 DAISY (CONT'D) Do you understand, I don't want to be with you... I tried to tell you that in New York... You just don't listen... 
BENJAMIN You'll change your mind. 
DAISY We're not little children playing under the table... Remember, when you came to New York. You didn't belong there. I didn't want to be with you then, I don't want to be with you now! I want you to leave! I'm not going anywhere with you! I want you to stay out of my life! 
And she turns away from him again...It's dead still... and we look at her staring at the curtains... And after some moments she turns back to look at Benjamin... And there are just the curtains billowing in the breeze... Benjamin is gone... 
197    INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, PRESENT        197

206   INT. THE BEDROOM, NOLAN HOUSE - THAT NIGHT, 1962             206 
He sets her bags down. Queenie despite her reservations has left some clean towels on the bed for her... There's an inept quiet. The two of them with nothing left to say... And they listen to the quiet... The house with its symphony of night noises... 
BENJAMIN Goodnight. 
He is just at the door... when she says... 
DAISY Sleep with me. 
BENJAMIN Are you sure? 
DAISY Yes. 
He turns to her. They look at each other. And they kiss, A kiss that has waited for thirty years. A kiss that has waited a lifetime. And yes, there is passion... and need... but most particularly, the awkwardness of people discovering each other for the first time... While he gently, tenderly, kisses her, undresses her..

Daisy and Benjamin, naked, passionately kissing... 
DAISY (CONT'D) ...I worked in a flower shop... 
They lay on the bed, kissing, caressing... 
DAISY (CONT'D) ...I went to American movies a lot. 
They kiss more and more passionately...And Benjamin about to make love to her hesitates... 
DAISY (CONT'D) You won't hurt me... 
He kisses her scarred crooked leg. Kisses her body.     And as they make love in the old bedroom... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) I asked her to come with me... 
What follows feels like a HOME MOVIE...without any sound. 
207   EXT. THE FLORIDA GULF COAST - ANOTHER DAY, 1963                207

DAISY We wouldn't have this... We wouldn't be here... It happened when it was supposed to happen... 
They look at each other... 
BENJAMIN Relationships have a time and a place. 
DAISY Don't say that. 
BENJAMIN What I mean is... You don't usually get more than one chance. If you miss it, it's too late... and it's gone... We're lucky... we had more than one chance. 
DAISY (laughs) That's easy for you to say... You'll have plenty of chances. 
She tenderly touches his hand... They look at each other... And dedicating herself... 
DAISY (CONT'D) I'm going to enjoy every moment I have with you... 
The waiter's come over. 
BENJAMIN Have you ever had a Sazerac with whiskey not brandy? 
DAISY'S (smiles) I'm with you, aren't I?   I'll try anything. 
And the wind changes direction, the rain coming in through the open windows of the bar, getting them wet... people run for cover... 
DAISY Bet I can stay out here longer than you can.

We see a young pregnant Woman, a renter, being shown by Benjamin along with a Real Estate Agent, around the old house. 
THE WOMAN ...It's such a lovely place... You must have a lot of fond memories. It must be hard for you to give it up. 
Benjamin doesn't say anything. There's a knock on the door. Benjamin opens it, to let an OLDER MAN in... quite a bit older... 
(CONTINUED) 
225   CONTINUED:                                                225

And he sees his wife... pleased to see her... hugging her... tenderly kissing her... and their age difference readily obvious... Benjamin acutely aware of it... 
THE WOMAN It's a wonderful old place, darling... I think we will be so happy here... 
They go into the hallway lined with the family photographs... She's taken by them...

CAROLINE'S VOICE (OVER) "It was one of the happiest times of my life..." 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We had no furniture to speak of... we would have picnics in the living room...

We see Benjamin and Daisy sleeping on a mattress on the floor in the bedroom... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) We vowed never to go to bed or wake up at the same time. We lived on that mattress... 
And we see just that, a short film of two people who can't get enough of each other living on a mattress... Daisy and Benjamin at various times, while they are either sleeping, or talking, or eating, or reading, or making love, ON THE MATTRESS ON THE FLOOR... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) (CONT'D) Our neighbor, Mrs. Van Dam was a physical therapist...

We see Daisy in a bathing suit, resting from swimming, holding on to the side of the pool, watching a young, well conditioned girl, 18, with nothing but her life ahead of her, completely in tune with her body, swimming laps... And as it comes to all of us, painfully aware of the years passing, her own physical mortality, she starts to cry... And we see that Benjamin, come to meet her, is standing above her. 
BENJAMIN You're crying...

DAISY It's just the chlorine... 
Looking at the young girl... looking at her... understanding... 
BENJAMIN You chose something to do... something so special... so unique... there was such a short period of time that you could do it... Even if nothing had happened ... Sooner or later you would be in the same place you are now... 
She's quiet... she knows what he's saying is true...

DAISY I promise you, I'll never lose myself to self-pity again... 
And as they watch the day begin... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) And I think, right there and then, she realized none of us is perfect forever.

Daisy doesn't say anything, lying still, staring off... her breathing shallow, laboring... 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) Mother? 
DAISY (agitated) I don't remember if I turned the lights off. Did I leave the heater on? 
The Nurse, on her way by, seeing her distress... coming in... 
THE NURSE Let's get you comfortable... 
She gently covers her... Daisy quietly lies back... 
THE NURSE (CONT'D) She's getting ready to leave... 
She looks at Caroline and turns and leaves the room. Caroline quietly looks at her mother. Their eyes meet. 
DAISY You have the most beautiful eyes. 
Caroline reaches to hold her thin hand. Daisy says something to herself. Caroline looks at her...she looks down at the book... 
CAROLINE He said, "She found peace."

BENJAMIN You're sure there's nothing wrong with her? 
THE YOUNG WOMAN DOCTOR She's a normal, healthy baby in every way... 
And Benjamin moved, kisses the baby's head... as he looks at this precious child of his...

DAISY It doesn't change for a moment who you are. You were a gift. Sometimes the gifts we are given are not free. 
CAROLINE You never said a word to me... 
Caroline, upset, gets up... 
CAROLINE (CONT'D) I need to go for a minute... 
She leaves the room... 
DAISY (enigmatic) My dearest darling, we were both deprived of him...

And Caroline, unable to hold it in, can't stop bitter tears from running down her face... The Nurse is called for... She goes off down the hallway... Caroline takes another moment and goes back into the hospital room... 
244B   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY, THE PRESENT          244B 
Daisy, seeing her come back in... 
DAISY I was worried you weren't coming back... 
CAROLINE (after a moment) You're all I have. 
DAISY Read the rest of it, darling. (CONTINUED) 
157A. 
244B   CONTINUED:                                               244B 
Caroline hesitates, then sits back down, and quietly takes up the "book." 
CAROLINE "You grew, like the doctor had said, normal and healthy..." 
245    INT. THEIR BEDROOM, SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE, NEW ORLEANS -        245 NIGHT, 1969 
The room's dark. We see Benjamin in bed, the baby sleeping between him and Daisy... And as Benjamin watches them sleep... he looks at his reflection in a wall mirror... his 51st year on this earth... 34 years old... a young man... He looks at his baby... he looks at Daisy... in her mid 40s... her hair's begun to gray... her face begun to show the natural touches of age... His stare awakens her... She looks at him sensing he's deeply troubled... He shuts his eyes... she watches him sleep, Daisy as troubled as he is... but for very different reasons... 
246    EXT. A PARK - NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1969                        246 
Benjamin is sitting with Caroline while she plays in a park's sand box... Caroline helping herself to a mouthful of sand... Benjamin, trying to get the sand out of her mouth... 
BENJAMIN Don't eat sand... 
Daisy comes over to sit with them... 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) She's going to have a really attractive diaper. 
As they sit watching Caroline playing in the sand... 
(CONTINUED) 
246   CONTINUED:                                            246 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I think you should find a real father for her... 
DAISY What are you talking about? 
BENJAMIN She needs someone to grow old with... 
DAISY She'll learn to accept whatever happens... She loves you... 
BENJAMIN She needs a father not a playmate. 
DAISY Is it that my age is starting to show...? Is that what you are telling me? Have you lost your desire for me...? 
BENJAMIN You don't need another child to raise... 
DAISY You're going to leave me, aren't you? 
He doesn't say anything. 
DAISY (CONT'D) You can't leave me. 
He's silent. 
DAISY (CONT'D) You can't do this to me...! 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) It was your first birthday. We had a party... the house was filled with people... 
247    INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - NEW ORLEANS - DAY, 1969           247 
The birthday party. A cake with a big number "1" candle. One-year-olds not having a clue. 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.0.) The fathers and mothers were there... 
He looks at the age appropriate mothers and fathers with their children... 
A MAN Before you look around they'll be in High School dating. 
Benjamin manages a smile. 
247A   INT. THE HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - DAY - PRESENT         247A 
DAISY I remember your first birthday like it was yesterday. 
248    INT. SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - LATER IN THE DAY, 1969            248 
The house is empty, the guests gone... Daisy busy cleaning up from the party. She stops to look outside, at the backyard. Benjamin is sitting on a lounge chair... the baby, in her party dress, sitting on his chest... As Daisy stands at the window watching him with their baby... 
249    INT. THEIR BEDROOM - SUBURBAN TOWNHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT,    249 
Benjamin, dressed, watching Caroline in her crib, asleep. Daisy in bed, asleep. 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) I sold the summer house on Lake Pontchartrain... I sold my share of Button's Buttons... I sold the sailboat... I put it all into an account for your mother... And before you would ever remember me... 
And he bends to kiss his sleeping daughter, whispering to her... 
And a Man 50s, wearing a suit and a tie, comes in... 
THE MAN I'm sorry... I thought you were done... 
DAISY This is a friend of my family's... Benjamin Button... this is my husband... Robert... 
They shake hands... There's an awkward quiet... 
ROBERT It was nice to have met you... We'll be in the car, darling... 
(CONTINUED) 
263   CONTINUED: (3)                                               263 
DAISY I'm just closing up... 
And Robert and Caroline go outside to wait for her... 
BENJAMIN She's so lovely... she looks like you... Does she dance? 
DAISY Not very well. 
BENJAMIN I suppose that would be from my side of things. 
`DAISY She's a dear sweet girl... she seems a little lost... But who isn't a little lost at 12? There's a lot of her that reminds me of you. 
And she shuts off a set of the lights. 
DAISY (CONT'D) My husband. He's a doctor... was a widower... He's an incredibly bright, adventurous man... 
Benjamin smiles. 
DAISY (CONT'D) He's been a terrific father... and a great partner and friend... 
And she shuts off the record player and another set of lights... and for a moment they stand in the dark studio... and they look at their reflections in the mirror... seeing who they are now... 
DAISY (CONT'D) You're so much younger. 
BENJAMIN Just what you can see. 
She looks at him, and after all these years... she now understands completely... she looks outside at her daughter standing by the car with her "father," waiting... 
(CONTINUED) 
263   CONTINUED: (4)                                                   263 
DAISY You ware right. She needed a father. I couldn't have raised both of you. I'm not that strong. 
He's quiet.   They both are.   She looks at him. 
DAISY (CONT'D) I never thought how it must have broken your heart, too. 
His silence is enough. 
DAISY (CONT'D) Where are you staying? What are you going to do? 
BENJAMIN I'm at the Pontchartrain Hotel on the avenue. I have no idea what I'm going to do. 
And it seems like they want to hold each other. But they can't. It's still. And aware of the car's headlights waiting at the curb... she turns, holding the door open for him... 
DAISY I have to go. 
He nods.   He walks by her, going out. 
264   EXT. A STREET, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980                         264 
She stops to lock the door. She turns, getting into the car... and leaves... Benjamin stands on the corner, hands in his pockets, the car driving by him... and Daisy can't help but look at him... and then the car's gone... and as he crosses the street and walks off into the night... 
265   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - MORNING, PRESENT               265 
CAROLINE That young man was my father? 
And a Nurse comes in. 
THE NURSE The hurricane changed directions again. They are predicting it will make landfall sometime soon. 
(CONTINUED) 
265   CONTINUED:                                                       265 
CAROLINE Is there anything we need to do? 
THE NURSE Arrangements are being made to move people if we have to. I'll let you know as soon as we know anything. 
She leaves hurriedly. 
DAISY Please tell me what he says? 
Caroline looks at the book.       And Benjamin's voice comes in... 
BENJAMIN BUTTON'S (V.O.) "That night..." 
266   INT. BENJAMIN'S HOTEL ROOM, NEW ORLEANS - NIGHT, 1980            266 
Benjamin, sitting on the end of the bed, not sure why he came there at all... There's a sound at the door...as if somebody was there... 
BENJAMIN Hello? 
Its quiet...a hesitancy...He starts to get up and there's a knock on the door...He opens it...and Daisy's there. He's startled to see her... 
DAISY May I come in? 
BENJAMIN Please... 
She comes inside...an awkward quiet... 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) I don't know what I'm doing here...What I expected...? 
It echoes how she's feeling being there...They stand not knowing what to say...And Daisy says, sadly... 
DAISY Nothing lasts. 
He puts a finger to her lips. He shakes "no."       And what he's come to know, that some things do last... 
(CONTINUED) 
266   CONTINUED:                                                      266 
BENJAMIN I never once stopped loving you... 
He affectionately pushes a hair off of her forehead... 
DAISY I'm an old woman now, Benjamin. 
And he helps her off with her coat... She's still. 
DAISY (CONT'D) Benjamin... 
He kisses her... and she's quiet... and he undresses her... undressing himself... and they stand momentarily naked... the young man and the older woman. 
DAISY (CONT'D) Are you sure? 
BENJAMIN Some things you don't ever forget... the feel... the taste... 
And he kisses her again... 
BENJAMIN (CONT'D) ... the smell... 
He puts his mouth by her cheek... breathing her in...

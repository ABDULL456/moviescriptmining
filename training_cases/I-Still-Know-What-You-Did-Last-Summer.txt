I STILL KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER

TITLE SEQUENCE: 
1	INT. BOSTON - OLD NORTH CHURCH - DAY 
The setting sun backlights a series of abstract colored images. Holy images of STAINED GLASS and lead. 
FOOTSTEPS ECHO across the marble floor. 
REVEAL - JULIE JAMES 
A little older, a little wiser, yet still very pretty, no doubt. But she's all alone in the house of the Lord. 
And those doleful eyes of hers clearly telegraph a very heavy burden still rests upon her soul. 
She reluctantly walks past the rows of empty pews toward a curtained CONFESSIONAL BOOTH. 
2	INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - DAY 
Julie slides the drapes shut behind her as she enters, kneeling before the CLOSED SCREEN. A beat -- and the SCREEN SLIDES OPEN. 
A PRIEST 
enters the adjacent booth -- barely visible through the WICKER MESH. Julie looks down, crosses herself, and begins. 
JULIE Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. (a beat) It's been a year since my last confession... 
Julie swallows hard. This is difficult for her. 
JULIE (cont'd) I've never told anyone this. Not my mom, not the poice, not even my friends -- except for the ones who were there and they...well they're not around anymore. You see I...I... 
PRIEST Yes? 
JULIE I killed a man. Well, I thought I had...then... 
She balks at the memory of it. The priest bows his head in the shadows of the other side. 
JULIE (cont'd) (emotional) You've got to understand...It was all an accident. A terrible accident. It's been a whole year. I've tried to get past this, but I just can't. 
PRIEST Go on... 
JULIE I have these dreams...horrible dreams. And this man is always there with me. 
PRIEST (reassuring) I know... 
JULIE You see, he was a killer. He murdered Helen and Barry, and he would have killed me too, if I hadn't...gotten away with it. (regathering) I don't know, I guess I just need to deal with the fear, the guilt...to finally say his name. Ben Willis. His name was Ben Willis... 
The confession is cathartic for Julie. She looks relieved until, 
PRIEST I know... 
Julie stops. Looks through the screen. A chill shoots through her body. 
JULIE You know? But how could you... 
Clouds of icy steam shoot through the partition. Julie moves closer to the screen, trying to get a better look. 
PRIEST (growls) I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER!!! 
A STEEL HOOK 
smashes through the screen right in Julie's face! She SCREAMS! 
SMASH CUT TO: 
3	INT. COLLEDGE LECTURE HALL - DAY 
Still screaming -- Julie jumps back, seemingly knocked out of her chair. She fights the unseen demon. 
Sitting beside her, Julie's friend WILL BENSON reacts. He's a good- looking kid in a shy, humble kind of way. And he tries to help her, but she's too busy turning ten shades of red. 
The PROFESSOR lowers his glasses, makes it even worse. 
PROFESSOR Nice to see you find Political Science so stimulating -- 
The lecture hall erupts with laughter. 
JULIE I'm sorry -- 
Julie grabs her stuff and bolts. 
CUT TO: 
4	EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 
Julie explodes out of the building. Hurries down a sidewalk. Will finally catches up. 
RAY I understand something. 
JULIE It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be. (beat) It just isn't. 
Ray is hurt and confused. 
JULIE (cont'd) Hey, why don't you stay up here? They have fireworks over the river. And...there's a million things to do. 
RAY I have to work, Julie. My boat's in Southport, remember? But, I get it. You need your space from Craokerland. And maybe from me, too. 
Ray starts walking away. 
RAY (cont'd) You know where to find me. 
JULIE Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while. 
Ray keeps on walking. 
RAY It's okay. I'm just gonna go. 
Julie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block her way. 
JULIE Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... (to herself) I'm just scared...that's all. 
But Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns quickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the walk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from the keychain. 
CUT TO: 
5	EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Students throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck, which is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW. 
He clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away. 
CUT TO: 
6	INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT DOORWAY - DAY 
Julie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She stands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a cat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen. 
6A	INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - DAY 
The faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the lock on each window. She stands for a moment. 
She picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and a jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf. She thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet. 
She takes the whole mess toward her bedroom. 
6B	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY 
She hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely furnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the windows, then climbs into bed with the food. 
On the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at one of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing. 
Outside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going places. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the room. 
DISSOVE TO: 
6C	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Julie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed. 
There's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER. 
Julie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the front door being CLOSED. 
Her arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb POPS. 
JULIE (whispers) Okay. Okay. Face your fears... 
She gets off the bed and stands still. 
JULIE (cont'd) (whisper) There's nothing... 
There's another NOISE down the hall. 
JULIE (cont'd) (whisper) Quiet. 
Julie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen. 
6D	INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
She gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the living room. She steps through the kitchen door. 
As she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway toward her bedroom. 
6E	INT. JULIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
There's NO ONE there. 
JULIE (cont'd) Okay, calm down, imagination. 
She relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly AJAR, light from the hallway slanting through. 
KARLA AND JULIE Magic 96.7! 
Julie hangs up and joins Karla dancing on the couch. 
KARLA I won. I won...I won, I won, I won. (teasing) Now, let's see...There's Tyrell, that's one. And, there's my parents ...And I got some cousins. (beat) Okay, Julie, you can come, but Mark said four tickets. That means you gotta get yourself a date. 
Julie thinks, she seems torn. 
CUT TO: 
9	EXT. SOUTHPORT DOCKS - DAY 
A SMALL MOUND OF RED SNAPPER is DUMPED -- wiggling and suffocating its way across the deck of a fishing boat. 
WE PULL AWAY TO REVEAL it's RAY who's just done the dumping. A coworker, DAVE, friendly, playful, and down-to-earth, calls out from the dock -- 
DAVE Hey, Ray...phone! 
Ray takes the phone. 
WE INTERCUT. 
JULIE Hi. 
Ray is happy to hear her voice, but cautious. 
RAY (beat) Hey. I'm really glad you called... I'm sorry. 
JULIE (compassoinate) No, you don't have to be sorry. I'm the one -- 
RAY No, I shouldn't have left so fast... I was just... 
JULIE It's okay. 
Dave holds up two wriggling snappers. He dances them toward each other in a puppetlike mating ritual, making KISSING SOUNDS and narrating -- 
DAVE (as the fish) Julie, I love you. I know I'm only a humble fish, but if you really look at it, you're a fish, too. (girl voice) Oh, Ray, you're right...Do me like a snapper. (mashing the fish together) Hey, something smells like fish... 
Ray waves him away, concentrating on his call. 
JULIE Ray, Karla won a trip to the Bahamas! An island called Tower Bay. And she wants us to come with her. 
RAY What? The Bahamas? You're kidding. 
Dave's interest is piqued. 
JULIE We'd have a long weekend just to sit in the sun, drink fruity drinks, and swim, and... (sexy) You know... 
RAY This weekend? 
Dave is watching Ray closely. Ray's expression hardens. 
RAY (hurt) You'll go away with you're college friends, but you won't go away with me? 
DAVE Idiot. Idiot. Idiot. 
Karla is watching Julie. 
JULIE It's not you, it's Southport. And it's the Bahamas! And it's free! 
Karla is watching Julie. 
KARLA You gotta sell his butt on the Bahamas? 
JULIE Ray, come on. I want us to be together. 
Ray thinks. Dave looks at him like he's crazy. 
RAY (can't give in) Julie, we're working a big run up here. It's been crazy. We probably have to go out again tonight. I don't think I can do it. 
JULIE Will you try...for me, please? 
Dave moves one of the fish like it's been shot through the heart. 
RAY Okay, I'll try. But, listen... (martyrlike) If I don't make it up, then you go ahead and have a great time. 
JULIE Ray...please try. I really miss you. (beat) Okay. Bye. 
She hangs up and Karla sits next to her. 
KARLA That boy has got fish on the brain. (sensitive) Hey, cheer up, Charlie. (singing a rumba) We're going to the Bahamas. Bahama Mama, yeah... 
10	EXT. SOUTHPORT DOCKS - DAY 
Ray is staring unhappily at the little pile of snapper. Dave is staring at him in disbelief. 
DAVE Man, what is your problem? We haven't caught anything for days. Pull the big ugly stick out of your butt. She asked you to go to the Bahamas! Man, you gotta go. We'll both drive up. I got friends I can see up there. 
Ray realizes how right he is. 
RAY Stupid. Stupid. 
DAVE Stupid. What were you thinkng? 
Ray reaches toward the body... 
12D	INT. RAY'S PICKUP - NIGHT 
Something FLASHES IN THE SIDE-VIEW MIRROR. 
12E	EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
Ray turns over the body. Something isn't right. Ray jumps back -- 
CLOSE - SLICKER MANNEQUIN 
Its eerie smile mocking Ray who turns for the truck. 
RAY DAVE! 
12F	EXT. TRUCK - NIGHT 
Dave hears something. He turns to late. SPLLAATTT!!! THE FISHERMAN jams his hook through Dave's jaw and skull and YANKS DAVE OUT OF THE CAR WINDOW. 
RAY ...Dave? 
There's no answer from dead Dave. Ray tries to see around the headlights. He moves slowly toward the truck. 
The BRIGHTS and FOGS come on, blinding Ray. The truck's engine REVS. The truck rolls a few inches, adjusting a bead on Ray. 
Then, tires spinning, the truck launches straight at Ray. 
Ray runs at the truck. AT THE LAST MINUTE, he ducks behind the parked car. 
HIS TRUCK goes SCREAMING past. 
Ray backs around the car -- 
AN EIGHTEEN-WHEELER 
goes barreling by in the other direction. Ray dives out of the way. 
IN THE ROAD 
Ray is exposed. He sees his truck closing fast. He's got nowhere to go. Then, at the very last second, 
RAY 
jumps off the edge of the road. His TRUCK SLAMS INTO THE BARRIER RIGHT WHERE RAY WAS STANDING. SPARKS FLY! METAL BUCKLES! 
Ray falls through the air. Lands hard on his leg. Tumbles down the hill, finally stopping with a crash. He lies motionless at the bottom of a ravine. 
FADE OUT: 
13	EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Karla exits the building. She watches Julie sitting on the curb. 
A truck turns onto the street. Julie looks hopeful, but -- it's not Ray. 
Karla approaches her friend. 
KARLA Girl, it's gettin' down to the wire. 
Julie turns. 
JULIE He's not coming. I thought he was just... 
KARLA Julie, you left four messages... Four. 
JULIE But, he said he'd try. 
KARLA He said he'd try. Try is like maybe. Try is nothing! 
JULIE (appoligizing for him) He does work hard. 
KARLA Work hard, huh? He's breaking your heart just because he can. (hesitant) And I don't want to have to say I told you so... 
JULIE Then, don't. 
A Jeep Cherokee stops, and an ebullient Tyrell steps out wearing shorts and a Hawaiian shirt. 
TYRELL Hey, baby, we gonna get tropical or we gonna get tropical? 
The passenger door opens and Will Benson steps hesitantly around the Jeep. 
JULIE Oh! 
KARLA (re: Will) Hey, sorry... (quick, playing it off) He's my friend, too. And that ticket is not going to waste. 
Will reads Julie's expression. 
WILL Julie, is everything cool? Karla said... 
KARLA I said we start having fun. And that means now. 
Julie takes a last look up the street. She stands. 
BROOKS You're in 201 and 202. 
KARLA (expecting this) Is that bad? 
BROOKS (lying) Not at all. Those are our honeymoon suites. 
Tyrell wraps his arms around Karla. Julie looks uncomfortably towards Will. 
JULIE Your what? 
BROOKS Honeymoon suites. I take it you kids haven't exchanged vows, yet? 
JULIE We haven't exchanged anything. 
KARLA Julie, we're talkin' suites! (excited) That'll be just fine with us. 
BROOKS And, while you're here, our marginally trained, off-season staff of five will attend to your every need. 
KARLA Wait...Did you say off-season? 
BROOKS July fourth weekend. Storm season starts today. The clouds roll in like clockwork. 
JULIE Storm season? 
BROOKS It's our version of winter. (hands over the keys) 201 and 202. There's Scrabble and Parcheesi in the lobby. Enjoy. 
And Brooks turns away through the office door. They walk toward their rooms. Will catches up with them. 
CUT TO: 
24	INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY 
They walk down the hallway. Karla seems annoyed. 
KARLA Ain't nothin' free in this world. Everybody says it, and it's true. (dissapointed) I wanted you all to have a good trip. 
TYRELL We will, baby...All this means is we got the whole island to ourselves. 
WILL And it's been blue skies all day. It might be perfect all weekend. 
JULIE It beets being on the mainland. 
KARLA Oooh, the mainland -- 
TYRELL Somebody's gone tropical on us, baby. Tropical! 
The mood is improving. A SQUEEKING NOISE interupts. 
A BRASS LUGGAGE CART has appeared behind them. And ESTES, 60s, the weary Haitian porter, steps from behind it. 
ESTES (a Carribean accent) 201 and 202...Who put you in...? (hesitant) Don't use these much -- 
JULIE (suspicious) Why's that? 
He sees their happy, expectant faces and changes the subject. 
ESTES No real reason. (then) Pretty fancy rooms for kids your age. 
KARLA We won a competition. 
ESTES Oh, yeah? What you have to do? 
TYRELL Guess the capital of Brazil -- 
KARLA Rio, baby! 
ESTES Ahh, good for you, girl. (waiting for a cue) ...And, where would you like me to put the bags? 
A beat as Julie and Karla exchange a look. Then, Karla tosses one of the keys to Julie. 
KARLA (to Estes) Their stuff in there... (grabbing Tyrell) ...and ours in here. 
JULIE Karla! You promised. 
KARLA (looking at Tyrell) I also promised Tyrell. 
TYRELL Promised me what, baby? (joking around) I made all my promises to William. 
Tyrell makes fake goo-goo eyes at Will. Estes looks away. 
TYRELL (cont'd) Sweetie, you brought your nightie, didn't you? 
WILL Forward! A girl needs time to make up his mind. (to Julie, thoughtful) Julie, look, if it's cool, I'll sleep on the couch and they can have their own room to practice for that real honeymoon. 
But Tyrell grabs Karla and drags her into the room. We here GIGGLES. 
WILL I'll take those. 
ESTES No, I've been doing this since before you were a dream in your father's eye. 
Estes grabs the bags and takes them into the room. Julie and Will are left staring at each other. 
WILL You sure it's okay with you? 
NANCY Not anymore. 
TYRELL He leave you? 
NANCY No. I shot him. 
Will and Tyrell exchange a danger-Will-Robinson glance. 
NANCY (cont'd) What you want is a Dark and Stormy: Vernon's rum, ginger beer, and a touch of Tabasco. Sailors drink it for luck in the hurricane season, trust me. 
ACROSS THE BAR 
Karla and Julie walk in talking quietly to one another. 
JULIE Am I bad? I mean, he's really great, and he's cute -- 
KARLA He's cute...And he's got a crush on you... (off Julie's look) But... 
JULIE (appologetic) I miss Ray...I tried to call him. 
Karla looks at her. She's sincere, but firm. 
KARLA Ray made up his own mind...so, you're free to make up yours. 
Joining the men, but continuing her thought -- 
KARLA (cont'd) For the next foury-eight hours... (joking) Your smile is a frown...turned upside down. 
She illustrates with her own big smile. 
TYRELL Pretty cool bar. 
KARLA They all start to look the same once you've worked in one. (to Nancy) Am I right, sister? 
Nancy reaches out a hand and they touch just the tips of their fingers. 
JULIE (to Nancy) I'm Julie. This is Karla. 
NANCY Nancy. (sarcastic) Welcome to Tower Bay's most happenin' hotspot. 
Nancy continues making their cocktails. 
JULIE 
backs into something, turns and gasps -- it's a statue of an OLD WHALER, complete with HARPOON, WHITE BEARD, and YELLOW SLICKER. 
She doesn't let Karla see that it upset her. 
Nancy puts their drinks down in front of them. 
NANCY Four Dark and Stormies... 
They all pick up their drinks. 
KARLA (toasting) To a great weekend -- 
WILL Yeah, a great weekend. Forget the weather! 
KARLA & JULIE I'll drink to that! 
They drink and toast again. 
KARLA (to Nancy) So what do you do around here for fun? 
Nancy looks straight at Will -- 
NANCY Make fun of tourists mainly. (beat) Or let them make fun of themselves... 
She flips a switch that lights the Karaoke stage. 
KARLA Karaoke -- perfect. 
JULIE Don't even think about it. 
KARLA Okay, I won't. 
She's already heading for the stage. 
TYRELL Go baby! Go! 
AT THE STAGE 
CLOSE ON the karaoke machine. Karla flips through a binder full of songs. 
KARLA Oh, this ain't for me, baby, this is for somebody who really needs it. (finds one) Ah-hah! One single with extra cheese! 
NANCY (it's true) Everyone thinks their a singer. 
JULIE No way. 
KARLA Yes. 
JULIE No. 
She grabs a TOWEL off the bathroom door, trying to help him clean up the mess. 
JULIE No, no, no. This was really sweet... 
WILL I scared you -- I crossed the line -- 
JULIE No -- it's not that. It's...I'm just a little on edge. I'm really sorry. 
WILL Hey, you don't have to appologize to me. I'm the one. I understand. (covering the awkwardness) I'm going to take a walk and dry off. 
JULIE Are you sure? I really appreciate it. 
He picks up a rose. Most of its petals on the floor. 
WILL I just really like you and I want you to feel good about everything...You know? I want you to be happy. 
He hands the rose to her. There's a moment between them. He reluctantly heads for the door. 
CUT TO: 
28A	EXT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Will looks down at his wet pants. 
WILL (soto) Dork. 
Passing Karla and Tyrell's room on his way down the hall, Will spots the DO NOT DISTURB SIGN. 
He hears an INCREDIBLE POUNDING from inside. He shakes his head and mopes down the hall. 
CUT TO: 
29	INT. HOTEL - KARLA AND TYRELL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Karla bounces playfully on their big bed as Tyrell crosses toward the windows. 
KARLA Tha's it. (bounce) I've decided. (bounce) I'm changing my major to finance. (bounce) And going to Wall Street. 
TYRELL Why? 
KARLA 'Cause that's the only way I'm ever gonna be able to afford a big bed like this. 
She falls back against the plush comforter, looking up at herself in a long MIRROR HANGING RIGHT OVER THE BED. Tyrell loves this and quickly moves beside her in the bed. She lets him get real close, then she jumps up -- 
KARLA (cont'd) Jacuzzi. 
Tyrell reaches for her, but she bounces off the bed. 
TYRELL Ah, baby, let's stay right here. 
Karla pulls her suit out of a bag and models it seductively and flirtatiously for Tyrell. 
KARLA I spent a hundred bucks on it...even if it's just so you can pull it off. 
Tyrell gets off the bed -- 
TYRELL I like the sound of this. 
CUT TO: 
30	EXT. HOTEL DOCKS - NIGHT 
Derrick, the dockhand, whistles in the darkness as he coils the bow rope of a service boat around a cleat on the dock. 
Ominous shadows play all along the dock. Out on the water there's a big SPLASH. 
The dockhand rises, looking out at the water with a sigh. 
DERRICK Damn. I should've brought my pole. 
He turns away. As he does, we see 
THE END OF THE DOCK 
where a sinister SLICKER FIGURE stands perfectly still, silhouetted by moonlight. 
Derrick paces down the dock the other way past a handfull of other tied-off staff and service boats. 
He picks up a hose and begins spraying down the hull of a Sunfish sailboat. 
He turns the hose off and begins coiling it, backing toward an EQUIPMENT SHACK. Suddenly, a HAND touches him on the back. He jumps and turns to see -- 
TITUS 
standing there smoking a spliff. 
DERRICK Get lost, you scared me. 
TITUS Fish are all over the water...Come on, let us take a boat out. 
DERRICK Titus, you're so stoned, you'd end up in Spain. 
TITUS That's why you'll come with Titus, mon. 
WILL Ahh, that feels great. 
KARLA (considerate) How's Julie? 
WILL Alone. In the room. (to Karla) Got any advise? 
TYRELL (annoyed) Yeah. Find another Jacuzzi. 
Karla shoots Tyrell a look. 
KARLA (to Will) Your not out yet, slugger. You gotta just get back up there and keep swingin'. 
CUT TO: 
31A	EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Ray is at a telephone booth up the street from Julie's apartment. 
He looks exausted. Blood seeps through his shirt. He's in pain. 
RAY I need an international operator. 
CUT TO: 
31B	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT 
In the empty night lobby, behind the desk 
THE TELEPHONE 
RINGS and RINGS. We push in on the phone RINGING unanswered in the night. Nobody is around to answer it. 
CUT TO: 
32	INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
The DOOR CREAKS OPEN once again to her room. And from a STRANGER'S POV -- WE SLOWLY CREEP INSIDE. 
A CLOUD OF STEAM billows from the open BATHROOM. THE SOUND OF A SHOWER is heard. We MOVE TOWARD IT. 
INT. SHOWER 
Eyes closed, Julie stands with her face right under the showerhead, trying to relax. Something softly goes THUMP. 
Julie opens her eyes. Turns off the shower. Stands there, frozen, listening. 
JULIE (calling out) Will...? 
No reply. 
AT THE BATHROOM DOORWAY 
In a robe with a towel on her head, Julie peeks into her room. Nobody there. She sighs, and crosses back to the bathroom sink. 
AT THE SINK 
Julie looks to a spot where her toothbrush should be. She frowns. Looks around. Some of her things are missing. She peers into the fogged-up bathroom mirror. 
She whips the TOWEL off her head and WIPES IT ACROSS THE MIRROR, MAKING THE BEDROOM BEHIND HER VISIBLE. 
Ready to spit, she looks down. AND IN THAT INSTANT -- WE SEE A SHADOWY FIGURE PASS BEHIND HER IN THE BEDROOM. She looks back up...and HE'S GONE. Julie turns on the water to rinse. 
ANGLE ON THE BEDROOM DOOR 
as it SLOWLY CREAKS SHUT, the SOUND DROWNED OUT by the SINK. 
INT. BATHROOM 
Julie turns off the water -- and KLUNK-KLUNK -- and NOISE at her door. The sound STOPS. 
INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM 
She steps out of the bathroom, crossing toward the door. 
JULIE Will? 
No answer. She peers through the PEEPHOLE. 
JULIE (cont'd) Is that you? 
She unlocks and opens it. Nobody there. 
Julie quickly closes the door and relocks it, her heart rate just begining to rise again as... 
KLUNK-KLUNK. She hears it again. Then, the sound STOPS. But standing at the door -- she realizes that's not where it came from. Her eyes immediately go to... 
THE CLOSET 
Damn. That's where it came from. She slowy pads across the room in her slippers toward the door. Trembling...she reaches for the handle...AND TUGS IT OPEN! 
There's NOTHING. She stares a beat. DRIP DRIP DRIP. 
She sees something on the floor of the closet. She touches a finger to it. 
She picks up the phone, listens, then dangles it from her hand. 
JULIE It's dead. 
An exasperated Brooks heads for the door. 
BROOKS Duh. The next couple of days is gonna be rough, but we'll make it. 
KARLA What about a radio? 
BROOKS Sorry. Emergencies only. 
KARLA What the hell would you call this? 
BROOKS I'd call this four spoiled city kids who wouldn't know a hurricane if it blew up their butts. (beat) All we can do now is batten down and ride it out. If things get really bad, there's a storm shelter. 
And Brooks is gone. Outside the window, it starts to rain. There's a CLAP of thunder. 
JULIE 
looks out the window with glazed-over eyes. 
35	EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
And we PULL AWAY from Julie's face through the glass -- SLOWLY TILTING above her room to another 
TINY WINDOW 
in the bell tower. A candle burns, and lighning flashes illuminate the haggard face of Estes, the porter. 
CUT TO: 
36	INT. HOTEL TOWER ROOM - NIGHT 
It's a claustrophobic room. Estes turns away from the window, shirtless in his uniform pants. A beaded cord hangs around his neck, small fishhook dangling from it. 
Beside the candle, he picks up a leather bag and dumps out a handful of voodoo icons: roots, coins, sea glass, chicken's foot. He sets them on a divination tray. 
He opens vials and sprinkles powder and assorted liquids into a small wooden bowl. He opens a drawer and extracts a toothbrush. He dips the brush in the bowl -- covering its bristles with a sticky goo. He holds the brush over the candle's flame. The old man watches it SIZZLE. 
ESTES picks up 
A STRAW FIGURE 
and impales it on his fishhook necklace. 
His eyes roll back in his head. He enters a trance. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
37	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
Olga, the maid, pushes her laundry cart toward the end of a long, dimly lit hall. She sees a pile of dirty linens outside of a room -- ROOM 228. 
She stops, perplexed. There's nobody staying in this room. She picks them up and stuff them in her cart. Then she knocks on the door. 
OLGA Housekeeping. (beat) Housekeeping. 
She knocks again and notices her hand leaving bloody marks on the door. She looks at her other hand. Her arms and hands are covered in blood. 
She turns back to the linens. Something bloody is wrapped inside of them. She paws at the sheets, trying to unravel the mystery -- 
The door the Room 228 slowly cracks open. A STEEL HOOK reaches out and slices into her apron. It tugs. She turns, and she starts to SCREAM, she is yanked into the room. 
A DO NOT DISTURB sign flips over the handle and the door SLAMS shut. 
We hear her SCREAMS from inside. 
CUT TO: 
38	EXT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT 
Establishing. Bars on the windows. Neon PAWN fickering. Hand-painted sign reads: Se Habla Ingles. 
39	INT. PAWN SHOP - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON AN ENGAGEMENT RING 
Ray's engagement ring. The pawn shop owner, MAC, cowboy hat, knows his job, holds it up to the viewing loop next to his eye. 
MAC Jeez, that's a full carat -- 
RAY How much? 
MAC Well, there's some flaws in her... 
RAY How much? 
Mac looks around his shop at the usual jumble of crap: vacuum cleaners, golf clubs, guitar amps... 
MAC Don't really have the market for something like this... (like it hurts him) I can go two...two-fifty. 
RAY Make it three hundred. And throw that in, too. 
42	INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY 
Will and Tyrell step out of the room into the long, empty corridor. They cross to a balcony overlooking the lobby. The whole place seems deserted. 
TYRELL Where is everybody? 
WILL (gallows humor) They're all dead...Dead, I tell you. (ghostly) Ahhhh, we're all deaaaddddd. Tyrellll, joinnnn usss. 
Will's voice echoes across the lobby. Tyrell is maybe a little nervous, but hiding it. 
TYRELL Shut up. 
They walk down the steps to the lobby. 
43	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY 
They cross the lobby. 
WILL (calling out) Hello? (worried) There's nobody here, Tyrell. 
Tyrell's already out the front entrance. 
44	EXT. HOTEL - DAY 
Will and Tyrell exit the hotel and make their way down the steps outside and go splashing across the flooded grounds. Debris from the storm is scattered all around them. 
TYRELL They're around...They just don't care about us 'cause we're the contest winners. (beat) Let's go find Stoner Boy...Make his lazy butt hook us up with fishing poles or Ping-Pong paddles or something. 
WILL (nervous) You know, the greenhouse effect has caused the gulf stream to shift and almost every meteorological expert expects a dramatic increase in tropical depression -- 
TYRELL Hey -- shut up, okay? 
Tyrell keeps walking. Will looks around at the wind-and-water-swept vista. Not much of a day for activities. 
WILL (sotto) I don't like to fish. 
Tyrell moves across the grounds. He looks back. Will is stopped in his tracks, looking up at -- 
IN THE WINDOW OF THE BELL TOWER -- 
ESTES, staring down at them. 
TYRELL (calling to Will) You coming? 
Will trots after him, but he takes a glance back at the window...Estes is gone. 
CUT TO: 
45	INT. HOTEL FITNESS ROOM - DAY 
Julie has finished on the stairmaster. Both she and Karla are sweaty after a good workout. Their moods have improved. 
KARLA Come on, Vampira. I got just the thing for you. 
Karla leads Julie over to the tanning beds. 
JULIE Cancer in a box. 
KARLA No, this is the safe sun. (joking) It's better than a day at the beach. 
Julie is reluctant. 
KARLA (cont'd) Come on, a little photosynthesis and you'll feel like a new -- 
JULIE Houseplant. 
Karla opens the canopy of the tanning bed. 
KARLA Exactly. 
Julie peels off her sweats. Lies down in her underwear. Straps on a small pair of GOGGLES. 
Karla lowers the canopy over Julie. 
ANGLE ON A WALL TIMER 
Karla sets the DIAL. 
KARLA (cont'd) Set to three seventy-five, bake for one hour... 
JULIE Karla! 
KARLA Just kidding. 
ULTRA-VIOLET TUBES 
come to life -- Julie is bathed in purple light. 
CUT TO: 
46	EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY 
Tyrell looks across the grounds and sees, at the far end of the tennis court, 
She runs across the room, shoving a folding table toward a row of BASEMENT WINDOWS. 
The door is hit again and again. Somebody is throwing their shoulder against it. 
Karla bangs hysterically on the windows, leaving bloody handprints on the panes. 
CUT TO: 
50	INT. TANNING ROOM - DAY 
Julie's eyes suddenly open through the GOGGLES. She thumbs off her WALKMAN. 
JULIE You say something? 
Nothing. And just as Julie lies down again, Karla's frantic SCREAMS echo down the hall. 
Julie goes to push open the canopy. As she does, the CANOPY LID is JAMMED DOWN ON TOP OF HER. A CHAIN shoots through the handles. Julie is locked on the grill. 
JULIE (cont'd) Karla! Somebody? Hey, this isn't funny. 
Suddenly the lights go off. Julie thrashes around, trying to free herself. 
JULIE'S POV - THROUGH THE PURPLE LIGHT 
She sees someone walking around in the room. The person steps closer. Julie could almost reach out and touch him. 
She begins to SCREAM! 
51	EXT. HOTEL POOL - DAY 
Tyrell angrily makes his way past the outdoor pool bar as Will follows. Tyrell spots a tray of empty bottles. He picks one up and smashes it in half on the ground. He holds out the jagged bottle to Will. 
TYRELL Take this. 
WILL And do what with it? 
Tyrell breaks another bottle in half. 
TYRELL Julienne of pool boy. 
They move toward the nearby POOL HOUSE. 
52	EXT. POOL HOUSE - DAY 
Tyrell and Will stop outside the door. There's MUSIC from inside. More Bob Marley -- "Lively Up Yourself..." 
TYRELL (cont'd) I'm gonna throw the door. Get ready. 
Tyrell opens the door and charges in. Will's right behind him. 
53	INT. HOTEL POOL HOUSE - DAY 
They spill into the room. A light fog hangs in the air. The two of them begin to COUGH and CHOKE. 
Titus sits on the floor facing away from them, facing a window through which gray light pierces the gloom. 
Titus doesn't move. He's too still. In front of him is a large BONG that still SMOKES SLIGHTLY. 
TYRELL Hey, pool boy. 
Tyrell closes the distance and kicks Titus in the back. 
Titus falls over like a block of wood, rictus already setting in. 
His hands are bound behind him. The cord is tied off to some pipes against the wall. 
HIS FINGERNAILS SCRATHCED GROOVES 
into the floor, scrabbling for the window and fresh air. 
Will points out two empty one-gallon PLASTIC BOTTLES. 
ANGLE ON THE BOTTLES 
One is labeled CHLORINE, the other MURIATIC ACID. 
Will pulls Tyrell from the pool house. 
54	EXT. HOTEL POOL HOUSE - DAY 
The two of them collapse, COUGHING and CHOKING. 
TYRELL What the -- ? 
Will splashes a puddle of rainwater on his face -- 
WILL That's chlorine and muriatic acid. Put the two together and you get cyanide. 
Tyrell rolls over on his back next to Will, practically coughing up a lung. 
TYRELL Cyanide? Like poison gas? (reality dawning) You mean, somebody really killed him...Omigod. Think...Think... 
Suddenly, they both hear KARLA SCREAMING. They sprint for the main building. 
Tyrell picks up the end of a cut mooring line -- 
TYRELL They were cut loose. 
WILL Julie? Wanna tell us what is going on here? 
They look at Julie. Their escape is cut off by water. They're scared. 
JULIE (freaking out) We're all going to die. He's going to kill us one by one. 
TYRELL Who? 
JULIE Ben Willis. 
KARLA (not this again) Oh, stop it! He's dead. You killed him. Now, get over it. We gotta think here. 
JULIE They never found the body. 
Her voice is low and urgent, an impromptu confessional. 
JULIE (cont'd) Two summers ago. We lied to the authorities. We hit Ben Willis with our car. Ray, me, Barry, and Helen ...We threw the body in the water to cover it up -- 
KARLA Julie... 
JULIE Only he wasn't dead. He killed Barry and Helen last July Fourth. 
Tyrell begins backing away from Julie. He picks up a piece of driftwood from the dock. 
JULIE (cont'd) I thought Ray and I killed him on the boat, but we didn't and now he's back to finish up the job. 
Tyrell holds up the log as a weapon. He's angry and afraid -- 
TYRELL We're on an island, miles from anywhere. I don't give a crap about you're fisherman. There's dead bodies pilling up everywhere and there's one guy missing -- 
Will moves closer to Tyrell -- 
WILL The porter...what's his name? Old Asbestos -- 
TYRELL Estes! That's exactly who it is. That old guy knows something. We can sit here and wait for him to pick us off or we can go find him first. 
Tyrell turns and heads down the dock. Will goes with him. Karla takes a few hesitant steps after them, then turns back toward Julie, who hasn't moved. 
KARLA Julie, we have to do something. 
Julie sees her friend caught in the middle, sees her suffering. She reluctantly starts for Karla -- 
JULIE (sotto) It's not him. 
CUT TO: 
62	INT. GREYHOUND BUS - NIGHT 
Standard bus folks: old people in Panama hats, buzz-cut military geeks on holiday. 
Ray sits in a seat. He's in pain and does not look good. 
He pops a handful of pills into his mouth and washes them down with an Orange Crush -- 
A dignified OLD LADY has been watching him -- 
OLD LADY People live healthy in Miami. (sincere, but unsettling) It's the future down there every day of the week...The future. 
Ray slumps back, waiting for the pills to work. 
RAY I'll keep that in mind. 
CUT TO: 
63	INT. HOTEL TOWER ROOM - DUSK 
The door to Estes's room BANGS inward. Tyrell, Will, Karla, and Julie charge into the room. 
TYRELL Yo, Freak Boy -- 
The cluttered room is empty. 
WILL He's not here. 
Tyrell and Will begin roughly searching through Estes's possessions. 
TYRELL We're gonna find some weird crap in here. 
In the corner there is a curtain used as a partition. Julie pulls the curtain back and discovers 
A SMALL, HEAVY CABINET 
sitting in the corner. It seems to glow from inside while casting an evil pall over the room. 
Julie moves toward it and hesitates before opening the doors. 
Inside -- is a small voodoo shrine. A candle has burned low before it. Hanging before the altar is 
THE LITTLE STRAW MAN 
JULIE I don't know. 
TYRELL (losing it) You never do...The guy at the nightclub, the body in your room last night. Little notes that only mean something to you. How do we even know you're not the one behind this -- 
Estes steps forward -- 
JULIE (to Tyrell) How do we know you're not? 
ESTES (to Julie) I know who you're talking about. He used to work here at the hotel. (beat) And I've seen him around again. Out in the woods by the orchard. 
They look at Estes...Is he telling the truth? 
ESTES I can't remeber his name, but I don't forget a face. (beseeching) I can show you... 
They stare a beat -- 
WILL How do we know you're not setting us up? 
ESTES Where else you gonna go, son? 
They look to the office, the gym...The sense of death surrounding them. 
KARLA I know I don't want to stay in here. 
JULIE We'll be better off in the open. If we stick together, maybe we can kill this creep for good. 
TYRELL Show us. 
They begin moving for the door. 
CUT TO: 
66	EXT. FERRY DOCKS - NIGHT 
Establish. The rain pounds a fleet of fishing boats. The boats are securely battened down in the weather. 
Ray limps past, heading for a small building at the end of the dock. Its sign reads: Island Ferry, Jack Paulsen -- proprieter. 
CUT TO: 
67	INT. PAULSEN'S BOAT HOUSE - NIGHT 
A gear-strewn office. Paulsen watches an episode of Party of Five. There is a loud KNOCKING at the door. 
PAULSEN What the... 
Paulsen slowly gets up. He cracks the door open. Ray stands silhouetted against the rain. 
RAY I need to get to Tower Bay Island. 
Paulsen senses something isn't right. 
PAULSEN We're closed. 
Ray pushes his way in -- 
RAY I need to get there, now. 
Paulsen looks at him standing there drenched. 
PAULSEN Did you happen to notice what's going on outside? 
Ray pulls out the gun and points it at Paulsen -- 
RAY I'm not looking for a weather report, I'm looking for a boat. So which one's yours? 
CUT TO: 
68	EXT. WOODS TRAIL - NIGHT 
Estes, Will, Tyrell, Julie, and Karla walk along a trail through the heart of the island. The storm has abated for a few minutes. 
It's windy, dark, and spooky. The kind of place you'd take people if you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story. That is just what Estes is doing. 
ESTES He worked here for many years. He had a nice family. A pretty wife and two little ones. A boy and a girl. They'd be about your age, now. 
They continue along the path. 
Estes looks at them in the dark, slowing for just a second. 
ESTES (cont'd) One day his wife went missing. Maid found blood all over the honeymoon suite -- Room 201. 
There are strange NOISES out in the woods. 
ESTES (cont'd) Eventually, they found her body. Pieces. A leg in the swamp. An arm washed up on Three Mile Beach. (beat) And the head they found much later. 
A huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the underbrush, scaring them. Estes calmly steps around it. 
ESTES (cont'd) Careful -- 
JULIE (softly) Did he do it? 
ESTES People say she was running around on him. People say he caught her in bed with other men. People say a lot of things. (beat) He disappeared, taking the two small ones with him. At least they were never found. 
KARLA (hurt) I'm your best friend...You could have told me the truth about what happened. I would've understood. 
JULIE (sad) Karla, I just wanted the whole thing to be over. I didn't want to involve anybody else. 
KARLA It's too late for that. 
Julie steps over to Karla. 
JULIE I'm so sorry. I brought this on everyone. It's my fault. 
Tyrell picks up on the mood swing. He moves closer to them. He's sympathetic. 
TYRELL Forget that. You didn't do nothing. This fisherman's a piece of scum. (hard for him to admit) I should've been listening to you... I'm sorry. 
Julie smiles for a second. 
TYRELL (cont'd) Now, let's take a look at the pantry. 
KARLA You think that's a good place to hide? 
TYRELL I don't know, but I'm starving. 
CUT TO: 
70	EXT. BEACH - NIGHT 
Will runs from the trees and finds himself by an old house. He sees Estes by the ocean, near a boat. 
WILL Hey Estes. (beat) Estes? Where'd you go? 
Estes doesn't answer right away -- he keeps his back to Will. 
WILL (cont'd) You abandoning us? How come you didn't tell us you had a boat? 
Estes picks up the boat's oar. He speaks low, almost inaudibly. 
ESTES This has to end. Now. 
WILL What -- ? 
Estes swings the oar, cracking Will's head hard. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
71	INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Tyrell, Julie, and Karla approach the pantry -- a huge steel door. 
72	INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Tyrell steps inside. 
TYRELL Steel door...Food...Perfect. 
He starts looking for something to eat -- 
CLANK. There's a soft CLATTERING from somewhere in the room. Everyone freezes, staring into the darkness. 
Tyrell puts a finger to his lips, then creeps down an aisle, listening. There's nothing but SILENCE. 
He moves toward the first aisle...He jumps out. The aisle is empty. 
JULIE AND KARLA 
move down an aisle behind him. 
Tyrell ducks around to the second aisle. He slices the air, ready to pounce. This aisle is empty. 
JULIE AND KARLA 
nervously move another aisle down. 
Tyrell moves stealthily toward the third aisle...This is it. He lunges forward into the row...Empty, also. 
There's a small SOUND...A MOUSE scampers off under the shelves. Tyrell turns and smiles at Karla and Julie -- 
TYRELL It's just a -- 
A ROLLING PIN 
bashes him on the back of the head. Tyrell hits the floor, unconscious. 
JULIE AND KARLA SCREAM 
KARLA Ty! 
A DARK FIGURE jumps down from the shelves. Tyrell puts his arms up -- 
TYRELL (yelling for mercy) Don't kill me -- 
JULIE Wait, it's Nancy -- 
Nancy, the bartender steps out of the shadows brandishing her rolling pin. 
Nancy tries the first of many keys. Something catches Julie's eye. She moves in for a closer look. Her eyes go wide -- 
ORCHID HOUSE - JULIE'S POV 
A powerful BOLT OF LIGHTNING cracks. Fills the room with a pulse of bright light. BEN IS STANDING INSIDE AND HE'S HEADING STRAIGHT FOR KARLA. 
JULIE (terrified) He's inside. 
Karla spins. Sees him. Her terrified scream blends with the cranes, now SHRIEKING VIOLENTLY. 
KARLA Please! Hurry! 
92	INT. HOTEL/ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT 
Nancy fumbles with the keys. Drops them. Julie tries to keep calm. 
JULIE Come on... 
93	INT. HOTEL/ORCHID HOUSE - NIGHT 
Ben closes fast, slicing the tops off orchids as he goes. He skewers a bud on the tip of his hook. 
Karla pounds on the door. 
KARLA (frantic) Hurry! 
Nancy fumbles for the right key but the lock is old. 
JULIE Nancy... 
NANCY (crying) It's jammed! 
The key is stuck. 
KARLA (through glass) Come on!! 
She's running out of time. Julie sees a FIRE AXE encased in the glass safety box. 
JULIE (determined) No way!! 
Julie smashes the glass with her elbow. Grabs the axe. 
JULIE (to Nancy) Move! 
Julie hammers the door with the axe. Wood splinters. Glass cracks. 
Ben is almost on top of Karla now. 
Julie swings. The axe breaks the glass, pulls the frame out. Julie drops the axe. They grab Karla. Pull her through. 
Ben swings. The hook rips Karla's shoe, but Julie and Nancy pull her through. 
Julie and Ben are face to face. Julie has the axe in her hands. She stares him down. 
JULIE Come on, gimme a shot -- 
Ben rips off his hook, eyeing Julie. 
KARLA (shouting) Julie, come on. 
They flee. Ben tries the door, realizes it had locked behind him. He can't fit through the circular window. He throws his shoulder against the door. And again. And again. 
The door frame starts to give -- 
CUT TO: 
94	EXT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT 
Julie, Karla, and Nancy approach the iron door to the underground storm cellar. Julie carries the axe. 
NANCY It's over there. 
They struggle together to open the heavy door. 
95	INT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT 
Stairs lead down into darkness. Karla hesitates -- 
KARLA I don't know... 
JULIE Come on, you can make it. 
Julie gets in, pulling Karla in behind her. They pull the door closed behind them. 
NANCY There's a light somewhere. 
96	INT. STORM SHELTER - NIGHT 
The darkness is complete. We hear MOVEMENT. 
KARLA Julie? 
JULIE I'm right here. Grab my hand. 
Karla and Nancy go to the area near the check-in and behind the desk. 
NANCY Look up there. I'll look over here. 
Karla looks behind the desk. Nancy is searching the shelves. 
CUT TO: 
101	INT. HOTEL BAR - NIGHT 
Julie tenderly searches the area around Will's stomach. She's fussing with the clothes, looking for the wound. 
JULIE You've got blood everywhere, but I can't find the wound. 
Will takes her head in his hands, looks her in the eye. 
WILL That's because it's not my blood. 
The slow change in Julie as she realizes... 
She starts to run. Will roughly grabs her. 
WILL (cont'd) It's time you woke up, Julie. 
His voice switches to that of a familiar radio disk jockey. 
WILL (cont'd) (as Mark in the Morning) AND START CONTEMPLATING THE ULTIMATE MAGIC GETAWAY! 
He drags her out of the bar. 
CUT TO: 
102	INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT 
Nancy sees a white metal box sitting on a shelf. She reaches for it... It's a first aid kit. 
ANOTHER HAND 
reaches over and lands on top of her hand. She jumps and sees Estes right behind her. Karla SCREAMS. 
ESTES Will...He's in on it. He's -- 
Suddenly Estes's expression changes to surprise, and 
A SPEAR TIP 
appears in the front of his chest. 
Nancy screams and looks over Estes's shoulder to see 
BEN WILLIS 
standing there holding a spear gun. 
Estes topples over on top of Nancy, pinning her underneath his dying, convulsing body. Nancy struggles to get loose. 
NANCY Help me. 
Karla rushes to Nancy. She tugs on her arm, trying to pull her free. 
The fisherman strides toward them. He raises his hook. He swings at Karla's head. 
THE HOOK CATCHES 
on a beam. Karla struggle with Nancy. 
KARLA Come on, come on. 
Ben tries to free his hook hand. Karla looks up at him. He calmly puts his foot onto Estes's back and steps down with all of his weight, driving 
THE SPEAR TIP 
deep into Nancy who expires with a sigh. 
KARLA (cont'd) Damn you. 
Karla, blind with rage, attacks the fisherman. He kicks out with a boot and sends Karla fying onto 
A GLASS TABLE 
in the lobby area. The table explodes. Karla is finished. 
The fisherman works his hook free from the post. Karla is unmoving and looks quite dead. 
CUT TO: 
103	EXT. WOOD TRAIL - NIGHT 
Will pulls Julie along a muddy path in the rain. He's got her by the hair. She's slipping and falling. 
WILL Look at the bright side, Jules. We finally get to spend some quality time together. 
Julie's trying to get to the knife she's stashed in her back pocket. 
THE HOOK 
goes straight into Will's chest. 
The fisherman has hooked his own son. 
Father and son make final eye contact, the son's eyes go blank. 
Ben stares in shock as Will expires, falling back into the mud. 
Ben SCREAMS in rage. Ray is tired. 
THWACK. Ben begins beating Ray. He puches him. He straight-arms him with the hook. He knocks him again and again and Ray is beaten, giving up... 
Ben has Ray against a tombstone. The hook slowly inches toward his eye. 
BEN Gonna blind you first. 
The hook is touching the eyelid -- 
A GUNSHOT 
rings out. A look of wonder crosses Ben's face. He slowly turns away from Ray. 
JULIE 
stands behind him holding the gun. 
JULIE Just...Die. 
BLAM. BLAM. BLAM. She empties the gun into Ben, who flies backward into Julie's grave. 
As he tumbles, Ben releases the dirt stacked beside the grave... 
A MUDDY LANDSLIDE 
slowly covers Ben up. 
Ben's face is covering over. His mouth starting to fill with dirt -- 
BEN You can't kill me. 
His face is completely covered. His mouth still moving. 
BEN (cont'd) I'll always be with you. 
The dirt covers him. It continues to fill, until just the 
GLEAMING METAL HOOK 
waves futilely out of the dirt. Then, is stops wiggling. 
Julie goes to Ray. 
CUT TO: 
105	EXT. HOTEL - NIGHT 
Ray and Julie limp across the grounds of the hotel. They are moving past some shrubbery when 
A DARK FIGURE 
jumps out. Julie yells. She and Ray jump back. 
KARLA 
stops in the middle of her kamikaze attack, knife held out. 
KARLA Oh, god, it's you -- 
JULIE You're okay. Thank god. 
KARLA Is he? 
They nod. They go to her -- jubilant group hug time. They compose themselves. 
KARLA (cont'd) You know, it's true what they say about package vacations...You get what you pay for. (beat) Now, how about we get off this piece of crap island. 
The first rays of the morning sun appear. Ray looks adoringly at Julie as the beautific light catches her face. 
Ray kisses her. She kisses him back. They are silhouetted against a beautiful orange sunrise. 
JULIE (smiling) We don't have to tell anyone it rained the whole time. It can just be our little secret. 
The three of them throw their arms around each other's shoulders and they start walking for the beach as... 
A COAST GUARD HELICOPTER 
rises into view.

Sc 1                                                  Sc 1 ADA (VO - Scs 2 to 7) The voice you hear is not my speaking voice, but my mind's voice. 
I have not spoken since I was six years old. No one knows why, not even me. My father says it is a dark talent and the day I take it into my head to stop breathing will be my last. 
Today he married me to a man I've not yet met. Soon my daughter and I shall join him in his own country. My husband said my muteness does not bother him. He writes and hark this: God loves dumb creatures, so why not he! 
Were good he had God's patience for silence affects everyone in the end. The strange thing is I don't think myself silent, that is, because of my piano. I shall miss it on the journey. 
Sc 2     EXT     SCOTTISH FIELD NEAR HOUSEDAY     Sc 2 
A woman in a dark crepe Victorian dress sits leaning against a tree, her hands cover her face, around her neck she wears a writing pad. She crosses a field with large bare trees, in the far background stands a 3 storey stone house. 
Sc 3     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE CORRIDOR     DAY     Sc 3 
A small girl roller skates down a dimly lit corridor. A parlour maid looks down the hall where the girl has disappeared. 
Sc 4     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMDAY     Sc 4 
Three men wearing long grey aprons are fitting the packing for a piano. On one of the men's arms is a tattoo of a whale in a wild sea. 
Sc 5     EXT     SCOTTISH HOUSE GROUNDS     DAY     Sc 5 
The girl wearing her skates sits on a small black pony. An old man is pulling it, but it won't move. (In the background, another aspect of the grey stone house.) 
Sc 6     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE FLORA'S BEDROOM NIGHTSc 6 
The woman lifts back the sheets from the bottom of the sleeping girl's bed. She is still wearing her skates. The woman cuts through the laces and removes the boots. One disembodied skate rolls across the room. 
Sc 7     INT     SCOTTISH HOUSE DRAWING ROOMNIGHT     Sc 7 
The woman stands at a window lit by moonlight. Her skin appears luminescently white. She touches the wooden window frame, the curtain, the objects on the window sill, her mind abstracted, her hands unconsciously performing a farewell. Turning from the window she moves to a square piano crowded by packing boxes. In the dim light she begins to play strongly. Her face strains, she is utterly involved, unaware other own strange guttural sounds that form an eerie accompaniment to the music. 
An old maid in night-dress looks in. Abruptly the woman stops playing. The emotion leaves her face, it whitens and seems solid like a wall.

Sc 8     EXT     UNDERWATER BEACH          DAY     Sc 8 
Under water a long boat passes overhead, its oars breaking the surface. 
Sc 9     EXT     BEACH                    DAY     Sc 9 
STEWART looks at FLORA 
FLORA She wants it to come. 
STEWART Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY 
ADA writes "I NEED THE PIANO." Her MAORI mimic copies her. 
STEWART Do you mean you don't want your kitchenware or your clothes? Is that what you mean? 
ADA signs to FLORA. 
FLORA We can't leave the piano 
STEWART Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased.... 
STEWART slows down as he watches ADA again sign to FLORA, he has the uncomfortable impression he is being interrupted. 
FLORA Mother wants to know if they could come back directly for it? 
STEWART is shocked, his mouth hangs slightly open, paused in mid speech. TAHU mimics this mouth drop perfectly. 
FLORA After they have taken the other things? 
STEWART is growing confused and anxious. His two mimics and their growing audience unnerve him further. 
PITO Kei Riri a te raho Maroke. (shouted loudly at TAHU) (Watch it dry balls is getting touchy.) 
SUBTITLED 
STEWART nods suspiciously towards the MAORI speaker not understanding him, the speaker smiles and nods back. 
STEWART I suggest you prepare for a difficult journey. The bush will tear clothes and the mud is deep in places. 
STEWART walks away. ADA stands beside the piano turned away from the activities. FLORA pats her hand trying to cheer her. Down on the beach a fire is lit and pipis are prepared for cooking. Some of the young men are racing naked into the sea. 
STEWART (to BAINES about the MAORIS) What are they doing? We don't have time for that. 
Sc 17     EXI     BEACH                         DAY     Sc 17 
It is some hours later and the carrying party are beginning to make their way up into the bush. ADA still stands beside her piano. FLORA wants to follow the party. BAINES comes back along the beach, trailed by a young Maori boy, KAHA. 
BAINES Mr. Stewart asked if I might show you to the path. (ADA does not move) ... May I carry something? 
ADA turns to BAINES, her face angry and defiant, her eyes full of tears. BAINES falls back, struck by her show of emotion. ADA and FLORA walk past him toward the bush. 
Sc 18     EXT     CLIFF ABOVE BEACH               DAY     Sc 18 
The party threads its way through the bush along the cliff. ADA pauses at the cliff top to see her piano below on the sand, tiny and desolate. Its distance and her love of it suddenly strike her. Its music is faint and becomes loud over the next scene. 
Sc 19     EXT     BUSH FROM BEACH               DAY     Sc 19 
Brown feet squelch through the mud, finally followed by dainty boots caked in dirt. The MAORI leaders of the party have stopped.

BAINES works his way to the front. 
AUNT MORAG LIFT - YOUR - ARM - UP - DEAR. 
FLORA sits on the bed sulkily. She leans back and crosses her leg. 
FLORA My REAL father was a famous German composer 
AUNT MORAG Ohh the tag is broken. 
FLORA (continues) .... They met when my mother was an opera singer... in Luxemburg... 
The two women pause to look at FLORA. ADA signs to FLORA "THAT'S ENOUGH!" 
FLORA Why? 
ADA looks away, the two women finish primping the dress. FLORA crosses her arms. 
FLORA I want to be in the photograph. 
Sc 22     EXT     STEWART'S Hut                DAY     Sc 22 
NESSIE half holds an umbrella over ADA as they make their way to where the camera is setup in front of a chair and a sparse display of three toi-toi. All about the house is muddy, so much so that they must weave their way through on planks and logs. A fine veil of rain is falling across the distant bush, the whole valley is shrouded in mist. STEWART looks through the camera at the REVEREND and the photographer who are posing as the couple, complete with tatty bouquet. STEWART notices ADA's arrival and seeing her as a real bride, his bride, he is struckdumb with pride, even the rough tapes at the back or the dress cannot destroy the illusion. 
STEWART Beautiful. 
The umbrellas are held away, the rain pours down. 
Sc 23     INT/EXT     STEWARTS HUT BEDROOM     DAY     Sc 23 
AUNT MORAG has brought a chair into the bedroom and sits knee to knee with FLORA. 
AUNT MORAG I thought she met your father in Luxemburg. 
FLORA Well, yes, in Austria where be conducted the Royal Orchestra. 
AUNT MORAG (frowning) And where did they get married? 
AUNT MORAG checks to see if someone is coming. 
FLORA (her Scottish accent becomes thick and expressive) In an enormous forest, with real fairies as bridesmaids each holding a little elf's hand. 
AUNT MORAG sits back, regarding FLORA with obvious disapproval and disappointment. She smooths back her hair. 
FLORA No, I tell a lie, it was in a small country church, near the mountains 
AUNT MORAG is becoming involved again. She leans forward. 
AUNT MORAG Which mountains are those dear? 
FLORA The Alps. 
AUNT MORAG Ohhh I've never been there. (she leans forward) 
FLORA Mother used to sing the songs in German and her voice would echo across the valleys 
That was before the accident.... 
AUNT MORAG Oh what happened? 
Down on the wet sand FLORA does a wild dance of her own invention using a seaweed wig. She finishes by rolling down the beach in the sand. 
BAINES views them with suspicion, yet he is magnetically drawn to the spectacle He has never seen women behave with so much abandon. His attention fixes on ADA's uninhibited emotional playing, and as he watches, he finds himself edging irresistibly closer. 
Sc 30     EXT     BEACH                    LATE AFTER NOONSc 30 
The shadows are long on the sand when BAIN'ES collects the boards. ADA and FLORA are attempting a duet. ADA notices him come towards them with the boards, obviously intending that they should leave. Her mood darkens, she continues playing stubbornly even though FLORA has stopped. Abruptly she finishes. In black spirits she replaces her cape and bonnet. BAINES is struck by this sudden change, he watches her mesmerised as he replaces the boards. 
Sc 31     EXT     BEACH                    NIGHT          Sc 31 
From a helicopter, the camera tracks along the beach, following the crashing wave line, to find the piano. 
SCENE 32 DELETED 
Sc 33     EXT     STEWART'S HUT & KITCHEN     DUSK          Sc 33 
The hut puffs smoke out into the valley. The lie of the land traps sound like a shell and the clear high notes of a voice echo out. Suspicious that ADA is singing, STEWART approaches the house quietly. Through the open kitchen door he sees that the keys of a piano have been etched on the table top. While ADA "plays" the notes FLORA sings them. 
STEWART puts his pack down. ADA stands to attention, folding the tablecloth back over the table. 
5, 6 + 7 See notes 
STEWART Hello, then. 
FLORA Hello. 
ADA nods. STEWART'S hand explores the markings on the table. ADA watches his hand moving under the checked cloth. 
Sc 34     INT     MISSION HOUSE               DAY     Sc 34 
AUNT MORAG, NESSIE and TWO MAORI GIRLS dressed in proper Victorian costume are kneeling around a huge double white sheet, sewing and cutting it. The MAORI girls are part of the mission's good works. They are dressed in European style and while their training is in polite proper domestic behaviour they constantly corrupt it with their demonstrative displays of affection, and their clay tobacco pipes to which they are addicted. 
STEWART is standing, looking on. BAINES is behind him in the kitchen removing his boots. 
AUNT MORAG (looking carefully at STEWART) Well you stopped combing your hair, which is a good thing, it was looking over done. (without pause but referring to the sheet) You see these are the slits that the heads will go through, show him Nessie ... they'll be dead, the Reverend is going to use animal blood, no doubt it will be very dramatic. Tea! (for NESSIE rather than to her) 
NESSIE It will be very dramatic. 
NESSIE leaves to get the tea. HENI, the MAORI girl with a Moku tickles MARI'S back while she sews. 
They sing the anthem in snatches. It is background to the conversation. 
STEWART (sitting down) What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano? 
AUNT MORAG Like it were a piano? 
STEWART It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound. 
NESSIB puts STEWART'S tea down. BAINES comes in with his tea cup dwarfed in his big hands. He stands back leaning against a wall. 
AUNT MORAG (hissing to NESSIE) Biscuits.' No, no sound. 
NESSIE hustles back to the kitchen. 
STEWART I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected. 
AUNT MORAG No sound at all? 
BAINES I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them. 
STEWART Yes, I suppose you would. 
BAINES remains silent. He looks away. 
STEWART Well Ada can play. 
BAINES shrugs. 
STEWART I have it in a letter she plays well. She's been playing since she was 5 or6. 
FLORA has stopped stacking. She is lying along the top of the wood, lifting a leg up and down, watching the men. 
Sc 36     INT     STEWART'S KJTCHEN               DAY     Sc 36 
STEWART, flushed with his plans, is pouring tea into cups. FLORA peers at cup level through the steam. ADA sits beside her at the table. 
STEWART I have got us some excellent land. Baines has taken some queer idea to have a piano, and you are to give him lessons. Have you taught before? 
ADA signs to FLORA. 
FLORA What on? 
STEWART On your piano, that is the swap. 
ALA finger signs, her face furious. 
STEWART What does she say? 
FLORA She says it's her piano, and she won't have him touch it. He's an oaf, he can't read, he's ignorant. 
STEWART He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ... (ADA is not responding well) Teach him to look after it. 
ADA's breathing becomes heavy with anger, she writes Curiously on her pad. 
NO! NO! THE PIANO IS MINE! IT'S MINE! 
STEWART regards her note and her passion with suspicion and disdain 
STEWART (getting up) You can't go on like this, we are a family now, all of us make sacrifices and so will you. You will teach him. I shall see to that! 
ADA's emotions are suddenly removed and she views STEWART blankly, eerily so. 
Sc 37     EXT     BUSH FROM BEACH               DAY     SC 37 
The piano is taken up through the bush by a group of six to eight MAORI MEN. It's very heavy and awkward and they grunt and struggle with it. 
HiM na ake 'nun na'. (Lift up the back) UNSUBTITLED 
Tern - tern! (Ass hole!) 
Hei niti niti maan! (turning around) You lick it.) 
Someone stumbles and the back of the piano comes crashing to the ground thundering out in the bottom end of the scale. People scatter. Only one stays who warrior like challenges the piano. 
Sc 38     EXT     PATH TO BAINES                DAY      Sc38 
Out of his pocket he takes a carefully wrapped tuning fork. He unwraps the package, lifts the back and lid and starts to tune. He sniffs the air. BAINES watches, He sniffs close to the keys. 
Scent? And salt of course. 
He works on. 
What will you play when it's tuned? What music do you play? 
BAINS looks over at him from the meal he is preparing. 
BAINES I can't play. 
The blind man stops working. 
BLIND MAN You don't play? 
BAINES No, I can't. 
I'm going to learn. 
The man goes back to work somewhat depressed by the futility of the venture. 
BLIND MAN Well my dear Miss Broadbent, tuned, but silent.

SC 46     EXT     BAINES' HUT                    MORNINGSc 46 
A slash of sunlight falls across the piano. Thousands of particles of dust become visible floating in the air. BAINES is at the window in his shirt/night shirt. He notices the dust on the piano and strips off his shirt which he uses as a duster. Under the shirt he is naked. As he wipes the smooth wood he becomes aware of his nakedness. His movements become slower until he is no longer cleaning, but caressing the piano. 
Sc 47     EXT     PATH TO BAINES'               DAY     Sc 47 
On the path to BAINES' house, ADA and FLORA sit in the bush. ADA's head is bowed. Her hands held over her face. FLORA tries to catch the spots of light in her palm as they twinkle through the thick canopy of leaves over head. 
Sc 48     EXT/INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 48 
The door opens. ADA and FLORA stand in their cloaks and bonnets. 
FLORA Mother says she can't stand to teach piano with it all out or tune. So I'm to do scales. 
ADA turns and walks off. FLORA bustles in. BAINES watches ADA from the window, 
FLORA I hope you've scrubbed your hands. 
FLORA begins a scale. 
Oh, it's in tune. 
She looks over at BAINES who is still gazing out the window. 
FLORA What's out there? 
She gets up to see what BAINES is looking at. She sees her mother and divines BAINES is looking at nothing. 
FLORA You have to watch me where I put my fingers. 
FLORA starts again. ADA can only hear the piano faintly but moves closer as she too hears it's in tune. 
Sc 51     INT     BAINE'S HUT                    DAY     Sc 51 
ADA's playing can be heard inside. BAINES sits back watching ADA. Her cape on the hook is dripping a puddle on to the floor and there is a circle of drips around her skirt hem. She is totally absorbed in her piano music as she was on the beach. 
BAINES watches. Her long white neck, now wet from rain, proves irresistible. He comes across the room and kisses her. ADA jumps up and prepares to leave. BAINES stands in front of the door. 
BAINES Do you know how to bargain, nod if you do. 
She doesn't move, 
There's a way you can have your piano back. Do you want it back? You want it back? 
ADA eyes him suspiciously. 
BAINES You see I'd like us to make a deal. There's things I want to do while you stay. If you let me you can earn it back. 
What do you think, one visit for every key. 
ADA is tense but she is thinking about it. She holds up a finger then points to the black of her dress. 
BAINES Your dress? 
ADA shakes her head. 
Skirt ...? 
She walks over to her piano and points to a black key. 
For every black one? 
ADA turns raising her head, nodding. 
That's a lot less, half. 
BAINES is counting the keys. ADA starts for the front door. 
All right, all right then, the black keys. 
She sits back at the piano. She plays the lowest black key as in number one 
She takes her hands off the piano waiting. 
It's better that you play. 
Obediently she begins, stopping abruptly, indignantly, as he touches her neck. 
BAINES Play... Keep playing. 
After a moment she settles back to the piano. 
Sc 52     EXT     BAINES' VERANDAH               DAY     Sc 52 
Outside FLORA is cradling the poor confused dog, asking him what cruel miserable person had sent him out into the cold and wet. 
Sc 53     EXT     RIVERHOLE NEAR BAINES'          DAY     Sc 53 
BAINES bathes in a riverhole. He is watched by a gathering of Maori, sometimes with great seriousness, at other times with hilarity. They pass between them his clothes, trying them on and mimicking him. One of the older women HIRA crouches close to the bank keeping up a steady line of inquiry. Her manner is relaxed but focused and persistent. She smokes a pipe- 
Sc 56     INT     SCHOOL HALL                    DAY     Sc 56 
FLORA stands on a kitchen chair. AUNT MORAG and NESSIE have paused from fitting FLORA's bodice and wire angel wings. They are attempting to learn the hand gestures as FLORA signs: 
"I shall listen hard to rehearsal, because I live too far away to go often." 
AUNT MORAG (suspiciously) Which sign is the word rehearsal? 
FLORA deftly demonstrates. 
AUNT MORAG I can't imagine a fate worse than being dumb. Turn around. 
NESSIE To be deaf? 
AUNT MORAG Oh yes, dear too - TERRIBLE! AWFUL!"' 
FLORA Actually, to tell you the whole truth, Mama says most people speak rubbish and it's not worth the listen. 
AUNT MORAG and NESSIE exchange looks. 
AUNT MORAG (stiffly) Well, that is a strong opinion. 
FLORA Yes, it's unholy. 
Sc 57     INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 57 
ADA is quick to remove a used plate and cup left on top of the piano. 
BAINES is sitting next to the window, his elbow on the sill, his head turned away. 
BAINES Lift your skirt, 
ADA stops playing. She turns to him. Thinks about it then slowly lifts her skirt a little to show her boots. 
Lift it higher. 
ADA pulls the skirt up fractionally so the top other boots are exposed. 
BAINIES nods ADA starts to play again, not so confidently as before. 
BAINES moves close, he goes down on his knees to watch her feet on the pedals. 
BAINES Higher. 
ADA doesn't hear. 
Lift it higher. 
She stops and lifts her skirt to her knees. She looks at BAINES with ill-disguised contempt. BAINES is enthralled with her legs, or what he can now see of them. He moves back to watch them from behind. He's lying on the ground, head propped on his arm. ADA's slim stockinged calves work the pedals, one of the stockings has a small hole through which her white skins shows

HENI holds STEWART'S horse near a wooden gate. Its wet coat steams in he night air, making the whole horse glow. HENI talks softly to it in Maori. 
Sc 59     INT     MISSION HOUSE               NIGHT     Sc 59 
Inside the REVEREND is closely watched by STEWART, AUNT MORAG and NESSIE as he cuts out the shape of an axe from a piece of marbled cardboard. A lamplight flickers warm tones across their faces while the rest of the room is dark giving it a conspiratorial air. 
Sc 62     INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 62 
BAINES secures a chair against the door while ADA is removing her dress top. She sits at the piano hugging herself against the chill. As BAINES passes be knocks the jacket off the chair back. He picks it up and takes it across to her seat by the window. 
BAINES nods and ADA begins to play. BAINES fingers the still warm jacket1 he lifts it up and smells it. ADA turns around and stops playing suddenly appalled by his odd sensual pleasure taking. She holds out her hand for the jacket, her expression stern and censorious. She indicates he should return it to the chair back. BAINES ignores her. ADA stands and comes over to BAINES. She pulls the jacket from his hands and replaces it across the chair back, but as she turns to sit, 
BAINES is beside her. He pulls the shoulders of her bodice down, exposing her shoulders and some of her breast. ADA immediately stands, but BMNES is much stronger and man-handles her across to the bed. ADA struggles seriously, this is much, much more than she was expecting. 
BAINES Ada, four keys. 
ADA holds up five fingers and mouths 'five'. 
I just want to lie. 
ADA shakes her head vigorously and again mouths five'. 
All right, all right five. 
ADA no longer struggles. She is stiff and still. BAINES intoxicated by the smell and presence of her skin becomes soft and gentle. He kisses and touches her with feeling and affection. Then suddenly aware of her stillness he too becomes still. He pulls himself up to see whether her face betrays her feelings. ADA seizes this opportunity to return to the uncertain sanctuary of her piano. From the bed, BAINES watches her run a hand noiselessly over the polished ivory keys, a gesture betraying affection never afforded to him. BAINES gets up. He shuts the piano lid forcing ADA to remove her hand. 
ADA immediately stands and dresses, marking hurtfully BAINES' ownership of her piano.

A golden evening. STEWART in his best shirt and trousers prepares the horse and cart.

Inside FLORA is in her finished Angel costume, she sings softly to herself while ADA undoes the long strands of plaits and separates them to comb. 
FLORA The Holly and the Ivy... 
STEWART comes in to put on his jacket, but the collar is all tucked in. ADA automatically adjusts it for him, settling it around his neck. Her touch, meant practically, strangely affects him. In an impassioned impasse, meant gallantly, he tries to kiss ADA's finger tips. The gesture falters as ADA, surprised, jumps back. 
Sc 65     EXT     SCHOOL HALL                    DUSK     Sc 65 
People are arriving at the school hall. One family is being ferried through the mud in a wheelbarrow.

One of the women is peeping through a hole in a make-shift curtain to watch the townspeople seating themselves. 
WOMAN They're bringing in extra seats! 
Despite this, there would still be only a maximum of forty people. 10 or so of them MAORIS in their best European dress. 
ANOTHER WOMAN Oh God, don't pin my hair too high Alfred! 
STILL ANOTHER Yes, me too, do it about here ... (she shows Alfred) 
Two of the women are putting a little c4ouring on each of the angels while two other angels are being smacked for putting their white gloved hands in the bucket of blood. 
Sc 68     INT     SCHOOL HALL                    NIGHT     Sc 68 
Everyone is chatting at each other's seats, except the MAOIRI guests who wait solemnly. AUNT MORAG is organising the placement of the new seats. BAINES arrives. 
FLORA is seen through BAINES' window Inside, ADA as ever charts her progress on the black keys, eleven. She turns to BAINES for instructions.  BAINES is not himself, he is sulky and distant. 
BAINES Do what you like. Play what you like. 
ADA is perplexed by this turn about of behaviour. A little uncertainly, she sets about her playing. After a little she too turns to see what BAINES is doing. He's not there. She is surprised then anxious as she fears the deal may be off when there are flaw so few keys to go. She starts to play again, but her anxieties prove too great. She stops and listens. She looks out the window, where FLORA is mucking about in the yard. She walks to his bedroom, listens, then opens the door. BAINES stands naked looking at her. ADA is taken aback 
BAINES I want to lie together without clothes on. How many would that be? 
ADA holds up ten fingers an impossibly high number of keys. 
BAINES nods. 
ADA is surprised; she didn't expect him to agree. ADA checks again holding up her hands. 
BAINES Yes, ten keys. 
Hesitantly, she starts to undress. She lies on her petticoat, having deemed the bed too dirty. BAINES lies, very still on top of her. A scraping sound is heard. 
Sc 76     EXT/INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 76 
FLORA is outside walking on sticks and logs trying to make sure she never puts her foot on the ground. She looks over at the house suddenly aware that the piano playing has stopped again. She investigates the mystery peeping through the various cracks and holes in the loosely built hut. Her vision is always only parts of bodies, the venture is one of challenge and curiosity. 
Sc 77     EXT     NATIVE PINE FOREST          DAY     Sc 77 
FLORA and three small Maori children play amongst some native pines. Two MAORI WOMEN smoke and chat nearby. The children rub up and down against the tree trunks kissing and hugging them. The game has an edge of promiscuity to it as they exchange trunks and hug one tree as a group. Unseen by the children STEWART marches towards FLORA. He pulls her off the tree. 
STEWART Never behave like that, never any where. You are greatly shamed and you have shamed those trunks. (trees) 
The MAORI WOMEN keep up an unacknowledged chant.

FLORA is still washing the tree trunk silhouetted against the evening sky 
FLORA is tearful and sorry for herself. The job has an increased futility as it has begun to rain- STEWART is inspecting her penance. She follows STPWART about the trees. 
FLORA (sulkily) I know why Mr. Baines can't play the piano. 
STEWART You've missed this bit. 
FLORA She never gives him a turn. 
STEWART stops and looks at her. 
She just plays whatever she pleases, sometimes she doesn't play at all. 
STEWART continues through the trees more slowly. 
STEWART And when is the next lesson? 
BAINES No. 
STEWART And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay. 
BAINES No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it. 
STEWART Well, I doubt I want it very much myself. 
BAINES It was more to your wife that I gave it. 
STEWART Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it. 
He closes the window. 
So that is agreed on? 
BAINES nods. 
HIRA has wandered stiffly into BAINES' room. She sits on the edge of his bed. 
HIRA You make BIG mistake George. In first place you should swap land for wife. Now look, she gone, you no land, no music box, you got nothing.

At the door of the hut STEWART is distributing buttons to the piano bearers. One squats catching them as they fall. A commotion begins as one of the MAORIS snatches the whole jar and runs off. Two of them give chase while the others insist on tobacco.

Inside the hut ADA had lifted the top of the piano and is peering in while playing notes to check tune and damage. 
STEWART Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes ~p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART. 
FLORA What will I play? 
She looks to ADA, who looks back through her not concentrating. 
STEWART Play a gig. 
FLORA (to ADA) Do I know any gigs? 
STEWART Play a song then 
FLORA starts a song, ADA walks past them out of the hut, STEWART ignores her exit moving up to lean on the piano. ADA is seen through the hut window wandering amidst the ghostly, blackened trunks. STEWART'S attention is drawn to ADA, he interrupts FLORA'S singing with a sudden outburst. 
STEWART (exasperated) Why won't she play it? We have it back, and she just wanders off! 
FLORA stops to watch her mother through the window. ADA looks towards the house as the music stops. 
STEWART Keep playing! 
Grimly STEWART slaps the top of the piano to FLORA's playing. 
ADA continues to walk, her face dark and puzzled. She stops. Her head stiffly, irresistibly, lifts and turns in the direction BAINES' hut. She peers deep into the bush as if attempting to penetrate a puzzle. She thinks and walks on.

Inside BAINES' small bedroom the raw dark boards contrast with the softness, whiteness of BAINES' and ADA's bodies, The long black strands of ADA's hair stick to her cheek and wrap around her neck. Her face is flushed and her eyes are bright. BAINES rolls his face across her chest, gently, slowly savouring the flavour of her body. Drunkenly they continue their sex slowly, slowly. ADA's breaths turn to low murmurs; these small sounds are extraordinarily moving to BAINES whose face swoons with joy. 
BAINES What?  What?  whisper....

As ADA dresses, BAINES sits on his bed watching. He is unhappy, thoughtful. 
BAINES Now you are going I am miserable, why is that? (He catches her hand and draws her to hint) Ada I need to know, what will you do? Will you come again? 
ADA is distracted, collecting her buttons from the floor, concerned at the time past, worried to dress and return. 
The camera cranes down and down to find STEWART wedged under the loose wooden floor slats. He cannot hear clearly, but ADA's hand reaching for each button is only inches away. One falls through a slat on to STEWART'S neck and on down his shirt collar. As she stands he rolls out. 
BAINES Wait! I don't know what you're thinking. (gently, teasingly) Does this mean something to you? Hey? (Stroking a strand of hair behind her ear) I already miss you. Ada, do you love me? 
ADA considers this question. Clearly she doesn't know, the question is more complex to her than to him, then as if by way of answer she kisses him strongly and sexually. BAINES pulls away confused. ADA finishes dressing. BAINES comes up behind her to help with the buttons. 
BAINES (anxiously) Come tomorrow. If you are serious, come tomorrow. 
ADA turns and kisses him passionately, with the new born enthusiasm of someone who has just discovered their appetite for sex. Then as quickly as she began, she takes her hood and cape and goes to leave. 
BAINES Tomorrow? 
She nods and is gone.

FLORA and ADA are both in their white nightgowns. FLORA stands behind ADA on a chair trying to sort out the knots that have matted at the back of ADA's head. ADA shakes her head from side to side playfully, making the difficult job impossible. 
FLORA Stay still! It's the very worst knots. 
FLORA tries to hold her mother's head still but ADA's high spirits are unstoppable and her hair flies out from side to side flicking FLORA in the face. 
FLORA Mama STOP IT! 
FLORA starts to giggle and retaliates flinging her own hair from side to side. The two women are twirling in the small bedroom their hair flying about them, FLORA is shrieking with the fun, then stops dizzy and sick. ADA continues flicking FLORA as she twirls. 
FLORA Stop it I feel sick! 
But ADA doesn't stop, her dark hair whirls about her, as giddy and disorientated, she knocks against the walls

Music builds and plays throughout.) The sky is dark and the wind is ballooning ADA's cape, wrapping it up high around her. The tree tops are swaying furiously. Inside the bush it is dark and ADA hurries up through the path. She is out or breath and glancing behind her as if to guard against followers, when directly in front of her STEWART steps out onto her path. ADA stops short. The look on his face is unlike any expression she has yet seen. His eyes do not look at her, but all about her in a way more animal than human. She lowers her eyes and calling his bluff walks steadily past him. But STEWART takes her arm and spinning her back, pulls her close and blind to all protest kisses her. ADA struggles furiously. His grip falters and she steps back staring at him, then runs off down the hill, but STEWART is on top of her clasping her skirts, pulling her towards him hand over hand, she slips and falls to the ground. STEWART is upon her, lifting her dress, touching her legs, ADA goes quite still, which throws STEWART long enough for her to scramble away, yet again STEWART catches her and again they roll on the ground, STEWART touching and kissing her, ADA turning herself this way and that to avoid it. There is a cat and mouse quality to their mute struggle finally broken by FLORA calling up the path, distraught and in tears, her angel wings have twisted about her waist. 
FLORA (TOP OF HER LUNGS) Mumma! Mumma! They are playing your piano! 
STEWART allows ADA to get up and the two women go back down the path towards home. The distant sound of the piano keys thumping.

STEWART Ada! 
But ADA scowls and pulls away roughly, STEWART lies back anxious not to break the spell and when he is still ADA continues to caress his chest. His eyes well with tears and he looks up into her face like a child after a bad dream, fearful and trusting. ADA continues like a nurse spreading ointment on a wound, tenderly and attentively she strokes down towards his belly. STEWART'S skin goose bumps and be shudders. He puts his hand on hers to still it1 she slides hers out and continues stroking. He looks at her pleadingly and childlike, she stops and kisses the soft skin of his belly, STEWART groans clutching the mattress. ADA seems removed from STEWART as if she has a separate curiosity of her own.

Next day AUNT MORAG stands circling in STEWART'S small darkened house. FLORA and ADA sit quietly together 
AUNT MORAG Ohhh, it's so dark, it's like a dank cave. 
NESSIE Yes, like a cave. 
AUNT MORAG Ohh no, it makes my skin creep! 
STEWART comes into the house with some logs, AUNT MORAG follows him across to the fire. 
AUNT MORAG Alisdair, is it because of our play? Have the natives aggressed you? 
She continues following him to the door. 
I have to say you have done the wrong thing here, you see you have put the latch on the outside. When you close the door, (and she doses it) it will be the Macna that lock you in, you see? With the latch on that side you are quite trapped. 
NESSIE (nodding her head in imitation) ... you are quite trapped. 
AUNT MORAG walks inside and continues to the table where her basket full of clothes and packets of food have been left. She lifts it from the table and begins to spread the cloth. 
AUNT MORAG We have just come from George Banes' and they have taken him over. It is no wonder he is leaving, he has got in too deep with the natives. They sit on his floor as proud as Kings, but without a shred of manners. 
NESSIE (in unison) ... without a shred of manners. 
NESSIE and AUNT MORAG are unpacking parcels of cakes and biscuits on plates putting them about the table. 
AUNT MORAG He is quite altered, as if they had been trying some native witchcraft on him. Well tomorrow or the day after he will be gone. 
STEWART Baines is packing up? 
AUNT MORAG Well he has NOTHING to pack, but he is leaving. And it is just as well; Nessie has foolishly grown an affection for him ... we have had some tears 
At this mention NESSlE's face crumples and tears again begin to flow. 
AUNT MORAG (very firmly) STOP IT! STOP! 
NESSIE remarkably obeys, blinking her face back to shape. 
ADA attempts to disguise her agitation, she moves to the piano and strokes it, she begins to play. 
I am quite frightened of the way back, we must leave in good light. Will we be safe? 
STEWART (wanting them gone) If you leave soon, yes, I am sure of it. 
STEWART and MORAG watch ADA at the piano. Her playing develops until she is fully absorbed. AUNT MORAG is intrigued despite herself

He is watched by MANA and his friend who squat passing a pipe between themselves. MANA strums tirelessly on his buttons. 
FLORA Mumma wanted me to give this to Mr. Baines. 
She holds out the cotton covered piano key. STEWART looks up. 
I thought maybe it was not a proper thing to do. 
STEWART keeps working, hammering the post into the earth. 
Shall I open it? 
STEWART No!! 
He stops and takes the key, suspicious and uncomfortable. He slowly unwraps it and turning it over reads it. Squeezing the key in his fist, STEWART staggers off in a daze, He returns, picks up his open pack spilling the nails. Finally he drops the pack and the key) and leaves with only his axe. FLORA follows confused. The MAORIS waste no time investigating the booty. MANA presses the piano key repeatedly.

STEWART (exasperated) why? WHY? I trusted you! 
He pulls the axe out of the table and swings it at the piano. 
WHY? 
ADA runs forward to restrain him, but it sinks deep into the wood. The struck piano lets ont a strange resonant moan. 
I trusted you, do you hear? I trusted you. I could love you. 
HIRA (angrily)I worried Feini. What's gonna happen you, you go home, but where we go? We got nowhere to go. 
HIRA's voice rises as BAINES lets go of her arm and rides through the group towards MANA. He takes the piano key in his hand, MANA pulls back.

The girls have long, stained, once white pinafores and everyone wears boots that seem too big, except the little boy who has the front cut off his hoots so his toes can hang out. 
Four little girls play a sedate game of skip rope, using a bush vine. BAINES watches, noticing in particular a little girl of about 9 with a bock. The boys and some of the wilder girls play BullRush.

STEWART nods. 
STEWART Never thought you heard words? 
BAINES shakes his head. 
STEWART (slowly) She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here (he presses his forehead with a palm of his hand). Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice. 
BAINES (trying to understand) Spoken words? 
STEWART No, but her words are in my head. (he looks at BAINES and pauses) I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words. 
BAINES (suspiciously) What are they? 
STEWART looks up at the ceiling as if reciting something he has learnt by heart and means to repeat exactly as he heard it. 
STEWART She said, "I have to go, let me go, let Baines take me away, let him try and save me. I am frightened of my will, of what it might do it is so strange and strong". 
BAINES recovering himself eyes STEWART angrily. 
BAINES You punished her wrongly, it was me, my fault. 
STEWART does not answer. Finally be looks up, his eyes full with tears. 
STEWART Understand me. I am here for her, for her I wonder that I don't wake, that I am not asleep to be here talking with you. I love her. But what is the use? She doesn't care for me. I wish her gone. I wish you gone. I want to wake and find it was a dream, that is what I want. I want to believe I am not this man. I want my self back; the one I know.

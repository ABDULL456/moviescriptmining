1   EXT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY                                                  1 
A tall, handsome man in a dark suit emerges from a Lincoln Towncar and enters a small, basement R&B/Jazz club. 
2   INT. JAZZ CLUB - DAY                                                  2 
He approaches a booth, says something in the din to the men there, then calmly shoots them and exits. 
AMERICAN GANGSTER 
3   EXT. HARLEM STREET - DAY (NOVEMBER)                                   3 
Bumpy Johnson, an elderly but still sturdy black man, elegantly dressed - cashmere overcoat, gloves, Homburg - stands in falling snow atop a flatbed truck - as he does every Thanksgiving - tossing down turkeys to the poor - like a benign king. 
Legend:   Harlem 
A younger man, the gunman from the club - Frank Lucas - Bumpy's driver/bodyguard/collector/protege - watches from below. 
4   INT/EXT. STREET / DISCOUNT EMPORIUM - DAY (NOVEMBER)                  4 
Whispering gunfire from a television set veiled by foreground snow: Soldiers in the jungles of Vietnam in 1970. A rich, cultured, authoritative voice offers: BUMPY O/S This is the problem. This is what's wrong with America. 
The war footage multiplies by twenty: a stack of TVs with price tags dangling from the knobs behind a display window. 
BUMPY O/S It's gotten so big you can't find your way. 
People on the sidewalk, out of respect or fear, part to let Frank and Bumpy and Bumpy's German shepherd pass. 
BUMPY The corner grocery's a supermarket. Candy store's a MacDonald's. And this place. (MORE) (CONT) 
4   CONTINUED:                                                          4 BUMPY (CONT'D) Where's the pride of ownership here? Where's the personal service? Does anybody work here? 
Inside, the emporium is vast, with aisles that seem to stretch off into infinity. The TVs give way to a display window full of Japanese stereo componentry. 
BUMPY What right do they have cutting out the suppliers, pushing all the middlemen out, buying direct from the manufacturer - Sony this, Toshiba that, all them Chinks - putting Americans out of work? 
He's not really asking Frank, so Frank doesn't answer. 
BUMPY What am I supposed to do with a place like this, Frank? Who am I supposed to ask for, the assistant manager? (pause) This is the problem. This is the way it is now: You can't find the heart of anything to stick the knife. 
Bumpy stops before a display of cameras and stares in. They're all pointed at him as a pain grips his chest and he sinks to his knees. Frank kneels down. 
FRANK What is it? 
Bumpy seems unable to speak, looks to Frank confused. FRANK Somebody call an ambulance! 
But the store suddenly seems empty. Frank yells into the emporium but can't be heard above the Muzak and the cash registers ringing up sales Bumpy will never see a piece of. Looking up at Frank, Bumpy manages weakly - 
BUMPY Forget it, Frank. No one's in charge. 
5   EXT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                        5 
Limousines from the funeral disgorge mourners: family, friends, celebrities, politicians. Cops on horseback move through the enormous crowd that has gathered to watch. FBI agents in cars snap pictures with long lenses of Italian mobsters like Albert Tosca. 
(CONT)

REPORTER - whose passing has brought together a who's who of mourners on this chilly afternoon. The Governor has come down. The mayor of New York - its Chief of Police and Commissioner - sports and entertainment luminaries - 
A white Bentley pulls up, disgorging Jackie Fox - the original Superfly - and his entourage. With his trademark tinted Gucci glasses on, he happily poses for anyone with a camera - including the Feds - before going inside. 
6   INT. BUMPY'S APARTMENT - LATER                                     6 
The report continues on a TV no one's really watching here: a March of Time-like history of Bumpy Johnson, famed Harlem gangster, Robin Hood and killer. 
REPORTER ON TV He was a Great Man, according to the eulogies. A giving man. A man of the people. No one chose to include in their remembrances the word most often associated with Ellsworth Bumpy Johnson: Gangster. 
Sitting off by himself in Bumpy's elegant garden apartment, heretofore his private sanctuary, Frank surveys the mourners circling the place like vultures: 
Tango Black, a huge brute, scavenging the catered food and tended bar ... Jackie Fox, surrounded by his ever-present coterie of sycophants ... Albert Tosca, an elegant Italian capo, and an underling, Rossi, at the bar. 
TOSCA White wine, please. 
A white man who looks like a banker - and is - sits down next to Frank. 
BANKER How you doing, Frank? 
FRANK All right. 
BANKER What a loss. (Frank nods) How are you otherwise?   Things okay financially? (CONT) 
6   CONTINUED:                                                        6 
Frank doesn't say. It feels unseemly to him to be talking about money here. He watches Tango carelessly set a watery glass of ice on an antique inlaid chess table. 
BANKER Bumpy set something up for you? 
Frank excuses himself without an answer, crosses to where Tango left the glass, and sets it on a coaster. 
10   INT. NY POLICE HQ - ENTRANCE/STAIRS - DAY                        10 
Four men in long black leather coats stride toward like they own the city. It's impossible to tell if they're cops or gangsters. 
Legend:   New York City 
11   INT. NEW YORK POLICE ANNEX - PROPERTY ROOM - DAY                 11 One of the same undercover cops - Detective Trupo - scribbles a signature and badge number different from the one on his gold shield lying next to the voucher requesting evidence needed in court. 
He pushes the voucher under a sign - "All Handguns and Narcotics Before 10am Next Window" - to a clerk who takes it past floor-to-ceiling shelves covered with files, plastic bags bulging with handguns, knives and gambling receipts. Bulkier items - like shotguns and baseball bats - lie unwrapped with dangling tags. 
The clerk reaches a chain-link cage where the most valuable items are locked up - narcotics, pornography, cash - checks the voucher against tags, takes down an old green suitcase. 
12        EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                             12 
Trupo's car - a Shelby Mustang - roars up. He climbs out, crosses to a warehouse with the suitcase as the other three SIU Princes of the City follow from another car, cradling grocery bags. 
13        INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY                                             13 
Trupo snaps the suitcase open revealing five half-kilo bags of uncut heroin in clear plastic bags. The other cops pull from the grocery bags: a Pyrex mixing bowl, flour sifter, boxes of milk-sugar, latex kitchen gloves, a medical scale, and yellow baggies. 
Hands peel back the distinctive black and green "evidence" tape on the clear plastic bags. Dump the heroin into twenty yellow baggies. A half-kilo of lactose is poured into each of the now-empty property room bags. 
TRUPO Now just enough for the reagent test. 
He removes one tablespoon of heroin from each of the baggies, and the now-almost-heroin-free powder is mixed through the flour sifter, poured back into the clear bags, the tape resealed, the bags returned to the suitcase. 
14        INT. NY COURTROOM - DAY                                          14 
The suitcase and   "heroin," and some weapons and money, have been arranged on   an evidence table with the care of a Macy's display window.    Trupo - the officer in charge of the case - watches the jury   files in - 15        EXT. UNDER EXPRESSWAY - DAY                                      15 
A Lincoln Continental pulls up. Trupo climbs out of his Shelby with a sports bag, crosses to the Lincoln, climbs in back where an Italian wise guy - Rossi - sits. Trupo unzips the bag revealing the recut heroin - in the yellow plastic. 
ROSSI V/O This is the French Connection dope. The same dope Popeye Doyle and Sonny Grasso took from us. 
16 OMIT                                                             16 OMIT 
17     INT. ITALIAN BAR - NY - DAY                                      17 
Frank comes into an empty bar, chairs up on tables. A middle-aged man mopping up glances up at him as he crosses to a back room. 
ROSSI V/O They seize it, arrest everybody, whack it up and sell it back to us. Our dope. They been living off it for years, these New York cops. 
18     INT. ITALIAN BAR - BACK ROOM - NY - DAY                          18 
Several ounces of the dope sits in foreground on a table. 
ROSSI They basically control the market with it. What the fuck has happened to the world, Frank? 
FRANK Fuckin crooks. 
Rossi, who looks more like a middle-aged accountant than the Italian dope supplier he is, makes two espressos. 
ROSSI Sad about Bumpy. 
Behind Frank, a TV airs a report by Walter Cronkite on the heroin problem among GIs in Vietnam. 
ROSSI Things are never going to be the same in Harlem. The girls, the clubs, the music - walk down the street, nobody bothers you because Bumpy's making sure of it. (hands Frank one of the espressos) How bad is it there now? 
18pt   FLASHCUTS TO HARLEM                                            18pt 
Guys barge into a room, steal money from a crap game at gunpoint - Cops push guys against a bar, empty their pockets - A dealer shoots another dealer in an alley - 
18pt   BACK TO THE HOTEL ROOM                                         18pt 
FRANK It's chaos.    Every gorilla for himself. 
(CONT) 
18pt   CONTINUED:                                                        18pt 
ROSSI Who can live like that? There has to be order. That would never happen with Italians. More important than any one man's life - is order. 
19     EXT. HARLEM - DAY                                                   19 
A street sign on a corner:        116th and 8th Avenue. 
20     INT. DINER - HARLEM - DAY                                           20 
As is his custom, Frank eats breakfast alone. A middle- aged waitress appears when he's done, picks up his plate and refills his coffee. 
FRANK Thank you, Charlene.      Last one. 
CHARLENE It's all right with me, Frank, you can stay all day if you want, but I wouldn't. It's nice outside. 
FRANK Then maybe I'll have to go for a walk. Just cause you said so. 
She smiles and leaves. Frank pours some sugar in his coffee. Someone taps on the window and he looks up, sees two servicemen - one in uniform - one he recognizes. 
21     INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                              21 Frank leads the servicemen up the stairs of a building. 
22     INT. REDTOP'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       22 
Corner apartment above the street. A girl sits smoking at a work table covered with drug-cutting apparatus. Another - Frank's cutter and sometimes-girlfriend, Red Top - sets a couple of packets of heroin in front of the servicemen. 
RED TOP On the house for our men in uniform. 
SERVICEMAN 1 Why, thank you, sugar, that's very kind. 
RIVERA Richie - 
Richie gets out, opens the trunk, grabs a Slimjim and bolt cutters, cuts through a gate chain and strides to the accountant's car, Rivera following. Richie trips the passenger door lock and pulls at the trunk release, and, as he comes around back to search it - 
(CONT) 
28   CONTINUED:                                                       28 
RICHIE Check inside. 
Rivera may as well; the damage to the case, if there is one anymore, is done. He crawls inside the car to look under the seats and in the glove compartment. Gravely - 
RICHIE Javy ... 
Richie's staring into the trunk like there's a body inside. Rivera comes over, takes a look, sees it's money: stacks of it rubber-banded together, spilling from grocery bags - more than either of them has ever seen. As the trunk closes - 
29   EXT. PARKING LOT / RICHIE'S CAR - LATER - NIGHT                  29 
Richie and Rivera sit in their car in silence, staring out at the car with the money in it. Eventually - 
RICHIE This isn't a couple of bucks. 
RIVERA It's the same thing.   In principle. 
RICHIE We're talking about principle? 
RIVERA Richie, a cop who turns in this kind of money says one thing: He'll turn in cops who take money. We'll be pariahs. RICHIE We're fucked either way. 
RIVERA Not if we keep it. Only if we don't. Then we're fucked, you're right. But not if we keep it. 
RICHIE (more to himself) Yes, we are. 
RIVERA Goddamn it, did we ask for this? Did we put a gun to someone's head and say, Give us your money? Cops kill cops they can't trust. We can't turn it in. 
They regard each other again in silence ... 
30   INT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - LATER - NIGHT                    30 
As a police captain counts the stacks of money, Lou Toback, Richie's superior from the prosecutors office, walks in, his night out interrupted by this emergency. He crossed to where Richie and Rivera sit alone in a corner. Quietly: 
TOBACK How much. 
RICHIE Nine hundred and eighty thousand. 
TOBACK What happened to the rest? 
It's a joke but isn't funny, not even to Toback. He regards his men who turned it in, then the other cops in the place - who are watching them and the money being counted. Toback walks over to the captain, and, quietly: 
TOBACK What're you doing counting this in front of everybody? Are you out of your fuckin mind? Take it into a room. Now. 
Richie's glance to Rivera says, You're right, we're fucked. 
31   INT/EXT. NEWARK POLICE STATION - PRE-DAWN                     31 
As Richie leaves alone, he's aware of all the eyes on him - knowing the other cops' looks don't signify awe or respect, but contempt and fear, like Rivera predicted. Neither will ever be trusted again. He climbs into his car, drives off. 32   INT. DINER - HARLEM - DAY                                     32 
Tango and his bodyguard come in and approach Frank's table where he reads the morning paper as he eats breakfast. 
TANGO Didn't you see the jar, Frank? I think you walked right past it. 
Frank ignores him, forks at his eggs, eats.    Tango sits. 
TANGO The money jar. On the corner.      What I got to do, put a sign on it? 
Frank indicates that he would answer if his mouth wasn't full. He swallows finally, but then only reaches for his coffee cup to take a sip, further irritating Tango. (CONT) 
32   CONTINUED:                                                        32 
TANGO Bumpy don't own 116th Street no more, Frank. Bumpy don't own no real estate in Harlem no more. I'm the landlord now and the lease is twenty-percent. 
Frank dabs at his mouth with a napkin and gives Tango a look that says that won't be happening. 
TANGO Then don't sell dope, Frank. Get a fuckin job. You need a job? You can be my driver, drive me around, open my door, yes, sir, no sir, where to, sir, right away, Massa Johnson, sir. 
Right now Tango is dead. No doubt about it.          On the surface, though, Frank remains cool. 
FRANK Twenty percent? 
TANGO Of every dollar. Every VIG, every truckload, every girl, every ounce.      In the jar. 
FRANK Twenty percent's my profit. If I'm giving it to you then what am I doing? Twenty percent puts me, and everyone you know, out of business, which puts you out of business. (reaches for his breakfast check) There are ways to make money legitimately, and then there's this way. Not even Bumpy took twenty percent. 
TANGO Bumpy's fuckin dead. 
Frank regards Tango a moment, gets up, takes out his money clip, covers the check on the table with a five, peels off a $1 bill from the clip, tosses it down in front of Tango. 
FRANK There.   That's twenty-percent. 
As he turns and leaves, Tango watches after him ... 
33   INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                               33 
Stitched-up, black and blue hands dump a can of soup in a pot, put it on the stove. 
34   INT. FRANK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - INTERCUT                     34 
A pencil clutched by long fingers scribbles figures. But no matter how many times Frank does the arithmetic, there's not much left, he calculates, after he pays the Italian suppliers and, if he were to, Tango. 
RICHIE (to the vandals) Hey, you want to shut up over there? 
The teenagers ignore him. He tries to ignore them, but it's hard with the constant noise. 
RICHIE No court will allow it for one thing. I won't allow it. 
LAURIE You? 
RICHIE When am I supposed to see my son? 
LAURIE Last weekend! 
Their son glances over at them. Richie looks over at the teenagers again breaking bottles, then back to Laurie. 
RICHIE Laurie, you can't raise a kid in Las Vegas. 
LAURIE Oh, like this is a good environment. Around your friends. There are less creeps in Vegas. 
RICHIE What's he going to grow up to be in a mobbed up place like that? What are you thinking? 
LAURIE I'm thinking - Richie - of him! 
RICHIE Goddamn it - 
The noise of the glass is driving him crazy. He strides over to the teenagers, who look at him like, What are you gonna do, old man, it's four against one. 
RICHIE I told you nice to shut the fuck up. Now I'm gonna kill you. 
He pulls out his gun and aims it at one of them, then the others. All instinctively try to cover their heads. (CONT) 
49      CONTINUED:                                                       49 
RICHIE Pick up the fuckin glass! 
As they dive to their knees to do what they're told, Laurie walks away with her son, who looks back over his shoulder at his father with his gun out. 
50      EXT. BANGKOK - NIGHT                                             50 
Frank sits in the back of a motor samlor.       Bicycles dart around it like flies. 
51 - 52 OMIT                                                 51 - 52 OMIT 
53      INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - NIGHT                                   53 
The clientele is almost exclusively black servicemen on R&R and Asian women. A trio of ex-GI's plays authentic Southern blues on a small stage. Ham hocks and collard greens come out of the kitchen. Smoke chokes the place. 
Frank, one of the few men not in uniform, and not drunk or stoned, sits alone at a table with a Coca-Cola and surveys the activity: Dope being rolled. Dope being smoked. Dope being shot. GI's and prostitutes climbing a staircase. 
His eyes follow an Army Master Sergeant, moving among the tables as if checking on the GI's well being. But at some, his hand takes money, leaves in its place packets of powder. 
The Sergeant feels eyes on him and glances up, catching Frank watching him from across the room. He squints through the smoke at the figure at the table in the shadows, and, in a kind of shock, more to himself - NATE Frank - ? 
Frank half-lifts his glass to wave, and Nate beams. 
54      INT. SOUL BROTHERS BAR - NIGHT                                   54 
Frank has guests at his table now: his cousin Nate the Sergeant, and two young Asian wise guys. They talk about him in Thai (subtitled): 
THAI He say how much he wants? 
NATE He said "a lot." What that means, I don't know. Four or five keys? 
(CONT) 
54   CONTINUED:                                                       54 
The Thais regard Frank a moment, size him up. 
THAI He's your cousin. 
NATE My cousin-in-law.    My ex-wife's cousin. 
THAI Ask him how much he wants. 
NATE How much you gonna want, Frank? 
FRANK A hundred kilos. 
Nate blinks like there's something in his eye ... 
55   EXT. BANGKOK - STREET VENDER - DAY                               55 
Steam and neon.    Frank and Nate at a crowded stand. 
NATE No one I know can get that much. It'd have to be pieced together from several suppliers and none of it's gonna be 100- percent pure. 
FRANK That's not what I want. 
NATE I know that. But that means dealing with the Chiu-Chou syndicates in Cholon or Saigon - if they'll deal with you - 
FRANK No, even then it's too late. It's been chopped. I want to get it where they get it. From the source. 
Nate stares at him ... then laughs.       Frank doesn't. 
NATE You're gonna go get it. 
FRANK Why not. 
(CONT) 
G56   CONTINUED:                                                       G56 
NATE Fifty, to cover them all. 
FRANK A hundred. And it's all I got left. So if that dope doesn't arrive, for whatever reason - (embraces Nate and whispers) Cousin or no cousin - don't let me down. 
He holds out a business envelope fat with money. Nate hesitates, knowing Frank has just said he'll kill him if things don't go right, then takes it. 
NATE I'll let you know when it's in the air. 
56    INT. RICHIE'S APARTMENT - NEWARK - DAWN                            56 
The nurse/paramedic who stitched up his hand is in Richie's bed making so much noise he's worried someone will call the cops. The phone rings. And won't stop. Neither will the nurse as Richie answers it - 
RIVERA V/O Richie? Richie, I'm in trouble.    This fuckin guy "made" me - I don't know how but he did. He went for his gun. I had to do it, I swear to God. Now they're going to kill me. 
Richie can hear in Sander's voice how serious it is and manages to disentangle himself from the woman. RICHIE Who. 
RIVERA V/O There's a hundred people out there heard the shots. You gotta help me. You gotta do something. 
RICHIE Is he dead? 
RIVERA V/O He's dead.    I'm dead. They're gonna kill me. 
RICHIE Where are you? Javy, where are you? 
(CONT) 
56    CONTINUED:                                                       56 
RIVERA V/O That's the problem. 
A57   INT. RICHIE'S CAR - MOVING - EARLY MORNING                      A57 
Richie on his police radio, which cuts in and out - 
DISPATCHER There are no cars in that area, Detective Roberts. 
RICHIE Bullshit. I got a man in trouble and I need back-up. 
DISPATCHER I missed that - you're breaking up - 
RICHIE I said, put the fucking call out again - 
DISPATCHER I just did. No one responded.     I'll try again, but - 
RICHIE Fuck you, too. 
He slams the mic down. 
57    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                            57 
As Richie's car turns a corner, the Stephen Crane Projects - the most foreboding place on earth - rises up: three dark 30-floor towers planted on war-torn grounds where a long-ago torched and abandoned patrol car sits like a monument. 
He parks and moves through an agitated all-black crowd, past an ambulance outside one of the towers, through oppressive heat. It's riot weather. 
58    INT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                            58 
Drugs on a coffee table. Body on the floor. Rivera, despondent, on the couch. The male paramedics, scared. Richie on the phone - 
RICHIE Sergeant, I'm not asking, I'm fuckin telling you: Get some patrolmen over here now. 
(CONT) 
58    CONTINUED:                                                         58 
Dial tone: the police sergeant has hung up on him.           Richie throws the phone. The paramedics stare at him. 
PARAMEDIC You got no back-up? Why is that? 
The only other person who would know the answer to that is Rivera, who just shakes his head in despair. 
RICHIE Bandage his head. 
PARAMEDIC Detective ... he's dead. 
RICHIE I know he's fucking dead. Bandage his head, clean him up, put him on a gurney and prop it up so he's sitting. And open his eyes. 
59    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                              59 
Richie comes out ahead of the gurney, moving quickly like it's a matter of life and death (which it is), motioning at the crowd to allow a path to the ambulance. 
RICHIE Step back, injured man coming out. Let them do their job and he'll be all right. Ma'am. Excuse me. Step back. Sir. Please. 
The people step back when they see the victim on the gurney: tubes in his nostrils, IV in his arm, eyes open. Before they can look any closer, he's put in the ambulance. As it pulls out, siren wailing, Richie leads Rivera safely away - 
A60   EXT. ALLEY NEAR STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                  A60 
They cross through an alley near the Projects and Rivera finally breathes a sigh of relief. 
RIVERA Thank you - 
The words aren't out of his mouth before Richie shoves him up against a car. 
RICHIE You robbed him, didn't you. 
FRANK That basically's the whole picture right there. 
84   INT. MORGUE - NIGHT                                              84 
A cadaver drawer slides open revealing - not Tango - but Rivera, staring up lifeless, his arms, stomach, legs and toes dotted with the scabs of a longtime addict. 
DETECTIVE Did you know his girlfriend? Good- looking girl. One of his informants.

RICHIE Beth. 
The medical examiner slides open another cadaver drawer containing her body. Richie stares at it. 
DETECTIVE Should've seen their place.    Like animals lived there. 
RICHIE I have seen it. 
DETECTIVE (to the examiner) Chose a good night, huh?   Grand Central Station in here. 
MEDICAL EXAMINER It's been like this. I'm lucky I get home before midnight; lots of careless- ness. 
Richie regards Rivera's personal effects resting on his chest in a plastic bag: few bucks, the Corvette key, a half- empty packet of heroin in blue cellophane. Richie takes the blue cellophane from the bag and, as the drawer closes entombing Sanders, holds it in his hand ...

REPORTER ON TV Since 1965, law enforcement has watched its steady increase and with it a rise in violent crime. Now unaccountably, it has exploded, reaching into cities as a whole - our suburbs and towns - our schools.

RICHIE But it's federal. I'd have to answer to who? FBI? 
TOBACK Me and the U.S. Attorney. No one else. No FBI. Hoover knows better than to mix his men with dope. Too much temptation for the feeble-minded. 
Though he's not in much of a position to refuse the assignment, Richie still isn't convinced it's a good idea. Toback levels with him - TOBACK Richie, a detective who doesn't have the cooperation of his fellow detectives can't be effective. 
RICHIE You know why I don't have it. 
TOBACK Doesn't matter. 
RICHIE No, they're all on the take and I'm not and it doesn't matter to anyone. Instead of giving you a medal for turning in money, they bury you.

TOBACK It's fucked up. You're right. Maybe this's an opportunity away from all that. 
They regard each other.    Eventually - 
RICHIE I'll do it, but only like this: I don't set foot in a police station again. I work out of a place of my own. And I pick my own guys. Guys I know wouldn't take a nickel off the sidewalk. 
TOBACK Done.

RICHIE I'm reluctant to bring anyone in I don't personally know.

Richie nods, Yeah, he knows that, but remains unconvinced. 
SPEARMAN Richie, we work together. You want me, you got to take them, too. 
RICHIE Where are they? Spearman looks out across the crowded dance floor. 
SPEARMAN That's Jones. With the skinny white woman. 
Richie's glance finds a young black man dancing wildly with his skinny white date. 
SPEARMAN That's Abruzzo, with the fat black one. 
Richie sees a young Italian with tatoos - the only other white man in the place - dancing with a heavy black woman. Both Jones and Abruzzo look more like criminals than cops.

Air conditioner full blast. Radio announcing the time: 4 o'clock. Frank glances out the wet windshield of the Chevy and watches 116th Street transform: 
It's as if an outdoor market has just opened its stalls. Junkies and dealers emerging from the alleys, storefronts, tenements and side streets - from the street itself it seems - snarling the cars and delivery trucks caught unaware. Small blue cellophane packets - and only blue - are pulled from pockets and change hands. In alleyways it's cooked up and sucked into syringes, and in dank, grim, indescribably filthy rooms, plunged into veins -

It's a kind of office party for Frank's brothers, cousins, wives and girlfriends, distributors like Rossi and other East Harlem guys, Charlie Williams, couple of cops on Frank's payroll, and the Chemical Bank Vice President. 
BANKER You got a stockbroker, Frank? 
FRANK I deal with enough crooks as it is. 
The banker jots down a name and phone number on the back of one of his business cards. 
BANKER This one couldn't be more honest. Ask around. He's got a lot of clients in the business. You can't leave all your money in safety deposit boxes; give him a call. 
The banker hands him the card and moves on. Frank's trying to have a good time, but the level of noise and revelry is beginning to make him uncomfortable.

The pickup pulls to the curb outside a Pleasant Avenue grocery store. As the guy enters the place, Spearman's car stops long enough for Richie to climb out, and continues on. 
Richie crosses the street, tries to see who the guy is talking to inside, but he's just buying a cup of coffee to go. Spearman's car turns the corner to circle around the block. As soon as it's gone, the man emerges from the restaurant with the coffee and walks straight at Richie who has to double back quickly not to be seen 
Richie sees a delivery truck double-parked, guys unloading crates. Hears a horn and knows it's must be Spearman stuck on the side street. The mechanic starts his truck. Desperate not to lose him (and his money), Richie hurries over to a taxi stopped at a light, flashes his badge. 
RICHIE Get out. 
TAXI DRIVER What? 
RICHIE Get the fuck out of the car! 
The driver realizes the man outside his taxi is crazy and tries to get his window rolled up. Reaching in, Richie gets his arm stuck, pulls at the lock, yanks the door open, drags the driver out, breaking the cabbie's arm, and jumps in. 
He swings the cab into opposing lanes to get around traffic, screeches around the corner, glimpses the truck far up ahead - guns the engine, flies through a red light, glances at his mirror at the cars that just missed him almost colliding - 
The truck turns up ahead, and Richie barrels through another red light, turns the corner and keeps the truck, a couple car-lengths ahead - in sight.

From around a corner, striding toward him, come four men looking like Gestapo thugs in leather coats, manicured hair - the Princes of the City. Richie detours into an alley as they enter the restaurant. 
Richie peers in at the restaurant kitchen through a grimy basement window. Watches Trupo and his SIU detectives burst in, guns drawn. They rough everybody up, get some down on the floor. One detective gathers the money and stuffs it in a bag. Another gathers the dope. The mechanic tries to protest and Trupo slaps him down with his pistol. 
Richie keeps watching as the NY cops arrest no one - but take the dope and the money (Richie's money) - and stride out as abruptly as they appeared, like bandits. As they come past Richie - 
RICHIE That's my money. 
SIU DET 1 The fuck are you. What money? 
Richie shows them his Bureau of Narcotics ID. 
RICHIE The bills are sequenced and registered with the Essex County Prosecutors Office. All begin with CF3500. Take a look.

TOSCA She's a lovely girl.    You should marry her. 
FRANK Too many things to look after right now to think about that. 
TOSCA Frank. That's a mistake. If I may say. Don't take her for granted, girl like that. 
They enter a rich, wood-paneled study lined with books. 
TOSCA You interested in history, Frank? The events that have brought us to where we are today? You know who was? Bumpy. 
FRANK Bumpy was interested in a lot of things. 
TOSCA I always wonder if people know when history's being made. And what they're doing at the time. This, for instance, could be a historic moment, and you're sipping a glass of ice water. 
Droplets snake down Frank's glass. He senses Tosca has finally gotten around to why he was invited here. TOSCA Bumpy and I did a lot of business together, as you know. Whatever he needed, he'd come to me and I'd do my best to provide it. He came to me, I didn't go to him, is the point I'm trying to make. You know why? 
FRANK He didn't have what you needed. You had what he needed. We've always had to come to you. 
TOSCA Yes.   Until now. 
Tosca studies Frank, who is a study in inscrutability.

TOSCA Monopolies are illegal in this country, Frank, because no one can compete with a monopoly. If they let the dairy farmers do that, half of them would go out of business tomorrow. 
FRANK I'm just trying to make a living. 
TOSCA Which is your right. Because this is America. But not at the unreasonable expense of others. That's un-American. (he studies Frank) You know the price you pay for a gallon of milk doesn't represent its true cost of production. It's controlled. Set. 
FRANK I set a price I think is fair. 
TOSCA It's very unfair, in fact. Your customers are happy, but what about your fellow dairy farmers? You're not thinking of them. 
FRANK (very calmly) I'm thinking of them as much as they ever thought of me. 
TOSCA All right. I can see you're getting excited. Don't get excited. That's not why I invited you to my home. To get excited. 
Frank doesn't look excited at all. He's the picture of calm. Tosca smiles benignly and gets up. 
TOSCA Here, I got something for you. 
159   INT. TOSCA'S SMOKING ROOM    - LATER - DAY                      159 
Tosca opens a humidor, takes out a couple of Cuban cigars. 
TOSCA Now what if - I'm just thinking out loud - you sold some of your inventory wholesale and I helped with the distribution. (CONT) 
159   CONTINUED:                                                     159 
FRANK I don't need it. I already got everything from 110th Street to Yankee Stadium, river to river. 
TOSCA Which is a little mom and pop store compared to what I'm talking about. I could make you bigger than K-Mart. L.A., Chicago, Detroit, Vegas. I'm speaking nationwide. And I'd guarantee you peace of mind. You know what I mean by that. 
Frank does. It's a backhanded threat.        Tosca clips the cigars with a gold guillotine 
TOSCA Frank. You can see I'm a Renaissance man. Unfortunately not all my people are as enlightened. Ask them, What is civil rights, they don't know. They're not as open to change from the way things are done and who's doing it. But I can talk to them so there won't be any misunderstanding. That's what I mean by peace of mind. 
Frank knows, in truth, he's not being given any choice in this matter. Still, maybe it's not so bad. 
FRANK You pay what a kilo now, 75, 80? I'd consider 50. And I can get you as much as you want. Tosca slips on his best poker face. Fifty thousand a kilo would be an extraordinary coup for him. 
Richie tries to find the guy in the chinchilla coat, but he's hidden by a flag. Then he glimpses him again just as Ali shakes his hand before climbing into the ring - 
Flashbulbs pop throughout the arena as Robert Goulet begins the National Anthem. Ali pointedly doesn't sing along. Richie frames the shadowy figure in the chinchilla coat, focuses as sharp as he can in the bad light, and snaps the shutter -

Richie tacks the photograph of the man in the chinchilla coat to his Table of Organization - low and off to the side by other pieces of the puzzle that don't fit, other new faces with no names. Spearman holds a scrap of paper - 
RICHIE That's is the plate number on the limo. Check with the company, who rented it. 
SPEARMAN He's a supplier at most. Or just a pimp. We'd've heard of him otherwise. 
RICHIE No, he's bigger than that. His seats were phenomenal; better than Al Tosca's. Joe Louis and Ali shook his fuckin hand. 
They look from Tosca's high position on the board to Frank's low one, and a wedding march played in traditional fashion on organ begins and carries over: 169   INT. BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY                                       169

TRUPO Do you pay your bills, I asked you. 
FRANK If you're not getting your share, it's not my fault, go ask the chief of police. 
TRUPO What's my share? You don't even know me. Maybe I'm special. 
FRANK No, you're all the fuckin same. 
TRUPO (shows his shield) What does that say? (Frank ignores him) Special - Investigations - Unit. See that word there? "Special." (he takes out a restaurant business card) Ten grand, first of each month, delivered here. (CONT)

Frank ignores the card, stares at Trupo like he's a fool. 
FRANK Detective ... There are some things you don't do. This is one of them. Not on a man's wedding day. 
Frank's resolve throws Trupo off his rhythm.           He manages: 
TRUPO Have a nice honeymoon.

INT. JIMMY RACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The report continues on a TV here as Teddy's driver, Jimmy Racine, yells at his girlfriend - 
JIMMY Where is it? 
DARYLYNN Fuck you, I'm not telling you. She comes past the TV and into the kitchen past a table covered with dope paraphernalia. 
JIMMY Where is my fuckin dope? You and your girlfriends take it again? I'll fuckin kill you. 
She yanks open a drawer, grabs a knife and slashes it at him. He grabs a gun and she runs for the stairs -

Moaning here, too.   Richie's lawyer-ex-girlfriend, in bed with him. 
SHEILA Richie, yes, fuck me like a cop, not a lawyer - (the phone rings) Oh, God, Richie, no - don't answer it - (he reaches to pick it up) No, no, no - 
RICHIE Yeah - 
SPEARMAN V/O PHONE Richie. Newark just picked up one of the celebrities on our Wall of Fame: Teddy's driver. For attempted murder. 
205   INT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - NIGHT                      205 
Richie's had Jimmy Racine brought over. Sits with him as the Three Amigos watch from the shadows. Just coming off his high, and the attempted murder, Jimmy looks disoriented as he sits in cuffs in the dungeon-like basement. 
RICHIE Because it's an attempted homicide, that's Grand Jury. Now, that Grand Jury could come in very favorably. Might turn out to be Attempted Manslaughter. Self Defense even. She had a knife. Depends on how I want to deal with you. You see where this is going. 
Jimmy looks around at the basement dungeon with concern. 
JIMMY The fuck is this place? 
RICHIE Let's say you beat it somehow. What do you think Cousin Frank'll think of that? He knows you had to sit here listening to something like this. And then you beat an attempted murder? Is he stupid? He'll assume you talked. 
Jimmy can easily imagine that scenario and it frightens him.

RICHIE You fucked up, Jimmy. But nobody knows. Frank doesn't know. Yet. Do you want him to read about it in the paper? Or do you want to walk out of here - no bail, no trial - just walk out, now. 
206   EXT. NARCOTICS SQUAD HQ - NEWARK - DAWN                          206 
Jimmy has thought about it all night and walks out of the building into the chilly morning air. 
RICHIE V/O Jimmy?   Look at me - 
Jimmy looks over his shoulder as if Richie just called to him from it, which he didn't. There's no one in sight - 
RICHIE V/O Any time I want to change my mind? I don't like the quality of your work? I can find a witness saw you shoot your girlfriend. It just took me a while. I even know what he'll look like. He'll look just like you.

FRANK What you're doing, as far as I'm concerned, when you chop my dope down to five percent, is trademark infringement. 
That.   That's what this is about.      Jackie nods, but - 
JACKIE With all due respect, Frank, if I buy something, I can do whatever I want with it. 
FRANK That's not true. That's where you're wrong. 
JACKIE If I buy a car, I can paint it, God damn it. 
FRANK Jackie, you don't need to. You don't need to make more money than you can with Blue the way it is. No one does. At a certain point it's just greed. 
JACKIE What do you want, Frank?    You want me to call it something else? 
FRANK I have to insist. You call it Blue Magic, that's misrepresentation. 
JACKIE Fine. I'll call it Red Magic, even though it doesn't sound as good. 
FRANK That's all I'm saying.   Wrap it in red cellophane and - (CONT)

FRANK Whack it down to nothing, tie a bow around it and call it Blue Dogshit if you want, just don't let me catch you doing this again. 
Jackie regards Frank for a long moment ... 
JACKIE Catch me? Insist? Infringement? I don't like these words as much as please - thank you - sorry to bother you, Jackie. These are better words to use you come into my place without an invitation. 
Jackie waits to hear a kinder word but Frank doesn't offer one. Jackie nods, Fine, okay, but it's more like a warning.

FRANK You don't go over there any more. 
Teddy doesn't like it, but nods. Suddenly his face is illuminated by light reflecting in the rear view mirror, an unmarked police car behind them, flashing its brights. 
FRANK It's all right, pull over, what are they going to do? Give us a ticket? 
But Teddy isn't as calm as he begins to pull over. 
223   EXT. GARMENT WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NY - LATE AFTERNOON           223 
As Trupo and his partner climb out of their car and approach Teddy's - 
TEDDY Frank?   Some of it's in the trunk. 
Frank regards him with utter disbelief. Teddy shies as if he expects to get hit. The SIU detectives arrive. 
TRUPO Hello, Frank. 
FRANK Detective. How's it going?        You have a nice Thanksgiving? 
TRUPO I did not, as a matter of fact.       Get out of the car. 
The Lucases climb out. 
FRANK Where's the Shelby? 
TRUPO The Shelby's gone, Frank. 
Trupo reaches in the driver's side window, takes the keys from the ignition and comes around to the trunk. Frank and Teddy exchange a glance as it opens. Silence. Then - TRUPO Want to come over here a minute, Frank? 
Six kilos of heroin are illuminated by the trunk light. Frank and Trupo regard it in silence. Then - 
TRUPO Now what are we gonna do about this? 
FRANK We're gonna shut the trunk and say good night, forget you pulled us over. 
TRUPO I got a better idea. 
Trupo reaches into the trunk, picks up two of the heroin bricks, tucks them under his arm and looks at Frank -

TRUPO Or would you rather I took it all and threw you and your brother in the fuckin river? 
FRANK I don't know, would you rather it's your fuckin house blows up next time? 
They hold each others' stare for a long moment. 
TRUPO I loved that car. 
FRANK I know. 
TOBACK That's because they all think you're on the take and you think they are. 
RICHIE They don't want this to stop. It employs too many people. Cops, lawyers, judges, probation officers, prison guards. The day dope stops coming into this country, a hundred thousand people lose their jobs. Toback isn't as sure the corruption of the official world is that complete. 
SPEARMAN Richie.   Excuse me. 
Spearman gestures to a couple of men in suits who want to talk to him.

FBI AGENT We can't say without compromising our source. You understand. 
RICHIE No.    I don't. Not when it's my life. 
FBI AGENT If you want, we can assign someone to you. 
RICHIE Who?    FBI?   You're going to protect me? 
Richie almost laughs at the thought, looks to Toback.             In fact, none of this is funny.

Walking toward his apartment down its dark street, bag of groceries in arm, Richie becomes aware someone is following him. He slows to let the figure get closer, closer, then turns fast, drops the guy and puts a gun to his head. 
MAN Don't shoot!    For God's sake. 
Richie keeps the gun pressed against the guy's forehead. 
RICHIE Talk.

RICHIE Laurie. I'm sorry I couldn't give you the kind of life you wanted. I'm sorry it was never enough. But don't punish me for being honest. Don't take my son away. 
She stares at him in disbelief.        Then responds in a louder voice than his -

LAURIE What are you saying? That because you were "honest" and didn't take money like every other cop, I left you? 
The bailiff looks over, but she doesn't care. 
LAURIE You don't take money for one reason: to buy being dishonest about everything else. And that's worse than taking money nobody gives a shit about - drug money, gambling money nobody's gonna miss. (more people look over) I'd rather you took it and been honest with me. Or don't take it, I don't care. But don't then go cheat on me. Don't cheat on your kid by never being around. Don't go out and get laid by your snitches and secretaries and strippers. I can tell just by looking, she's one of them. 
His lawyer.    Which is true.    Everyone's watching them now.

SHEILA Your honor, a lot has been said here today about how unsavory Mr. Roberts' environment is for a child. How dangerous it is. I'm sorry, but this is our world. This is where we live and we tell him, Protect us. We give him that responsibility, and then say, Oh, but we don't trust you to raise a child. We don't think you're fit for that.

They seem to have made it, winding back down through the jungle with the mules. Suddenly a barrage of gunfire erupts from the trees - a couple of Nate's men are hit as the rest dive for cover, shouting "Vietcong," and returning the fire. Frank drops down from his mule, gets a pistol out and shoots into the trees. Bullet-severed palm fronds rain down. 
FRANK Give them half! 
Nate, pinned down by the mules, can't hear him over the noise. 
FRANK Cut half of them loose!      The mules! 
Nate cuts the mule-train tether in the middle, slaps at the animals. As the freed mules disappear into a wall of trees the shooting subsides, then stops altogether. Smoke from all the gunfire rises like mist around the half dozen Thais and Americans lying dead on the ground.

ABRUZZO There's no Short Term Lot 3 at Newark. They're lettered, A, B, C, D - 
JIMMY I'm just telling you what I heard - 
ABRUZZO Then you heard wrong! 
Jimmy shies back a step in case Abruzzo takes a swing. SPEARMAN Maybe he means the time?   3 o'clock? 
JONES And this isn't a Jersey plate. Or New York. Not with just two letters. It's three and three, not two and three - 
JIMMY It's what he said - 
JONES Then what the fuck is it - 
JIMMY The fuck should I know -

ABRUZZO You're fuckin lying - 
JIMMY It's what he said.   I'm sure. 
SPEARMAN KA 760 - 
JIMMY Yes! 
Silence.   They all look at each other.       After a moment - 
RICHIE None of you ever been in the service? It's an Air Force tail number. 
274        EXT. SKY - DAY                                                 274 
The plane, with that tail number, descends through clouds. 
275        EXT. NEWARK AIRPORT - DAY                                      275 
Richie's entire staff of detectives, along with Toback, the DA and several customs agents, stand on the tarmac, watching the military plane taxiing toward them - 
276        EXT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - DAY                    276 
Quiet sounds of suburban domesticity - chirping birds, a distant lawn mower - 
277        EXT. NEWARK AIRPORT - CONTINUED                                277 The cabin door slides up, the passengers begin emerging: Military officers, embassy personnel and families. Richie's detectives and Toback watch him with concern as the official passengers, met by a bevy of assistants, file past - 
278        INT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - CONTINUED              278 
The kitchen. Frank's mother shows Ana some old photographs of Frank as a boy as they sip coffee. There's a tap on the glass French door. The women look up and see Trupo just outside it, and other police moving past. He waves. 
279 OMIT                                                            279 OMIT 
280        EXT. NEWARK AIRPORT - CONTINUED                                280 
An Army captain approaches Richie's law enforcement group. 
(CONT) 
280   CONTINUED:                                                     280 
297   EXT. MAMA LUCAS'S TEANECK, N.J. HOUSE - CONTINUED              297 
The dead dog slides against the fencing as Trupo overturns the kennel to reveal Frank's stash of cash. 
298   INT. AIRPORT HANGER OFFICE - MINUTES LATER - DAY             298 
Richie and Toback sit before the Federal Attorneys and customs agents. The US Attorney hangs up a phone ... then: 
US ATTORNEY That was a military transport plane. If there was heroin on board then someone in the military would have to be involved. Which means that even as it fights a war that's claimed 50,000 Americans lives, the military is smuggling narcotics. 
Richie's in serious trouble and knows it.    As does Toback. 
US ATTORNEY That's how these events are being interpreted by General Easton in that call to me. That someone employed by the this office believes the United States Army is in the drug trafficking business - and is trying to prove it by desecrating the remains of young men who've given their lives in the defence of democracy. 
RICHIE There are drugs on that plane - 
US ATTORNEY Shut the fuck up. 
Richie does, but can't conceal the contempt he feels for these men who've never spent a minute on the street but act as if know more than him, and who are, in the unfortunate organization of his world, his superiors. 
US ATTORNEY Is it any wonder then, because of your actions, the entire federal narcotics program is now in jeopardy of being dismantled as completely and enthusiastic- ally as that fucking transport plane? That's what you've accomplished Mr. Roberts. Single-handedly. 
RICHIE I had good information the target of my investigation was bringing dope in on that plane. 
US ATTORNEY And that target is? 
(CONT) 
298   CONTINUED:                                                     298 
RICHIE Frank Lucas. 
No one in the room, except Richie and Toback, has ever heard the name. The federal men regard one another blankly. 
US ATTORNEY Who?  Who's Frank Lucas? (no one seems to know) Who's he work for? Which family? 
RICHIE He's not Italian. He's black. 
Now there's a longer, even deeper silence, before - 
US ATTORNEY Is that supposed to be some kind of joke? You're this close to the end of your career in law enforcement, you're making jokes? 
RICHIE I believe Frank Lucas is above the mafia in the dope business. I believe he buys direct from the source in Southeast Asia, cuts out all the middlemen, and uses US military planes and personnel to bring pure No. 4 heroin into United States. 
Richie is looking at faces that are still trying to make sense out of his ridiculous theory. Toback tries to come to his defense - TOBACK Richie has a lot of experience - 
US ATTORNEY Does he. And how many arrests has he made in his so-called investigation? 
RICHIE I was promised when I took this job, it was about real arrests. 
US ATTORNEY Does that mean `none?' 
RICHIE I have cases against most of Frank's organization. Not him - 
(CONT) 
298        CONTINUED:                                                       298 
US ATTORNEY (more to the others) Frank's organization - 
RICHIE That's right. 
US ATTORNEY No fucking nigger has accomplished what the American Mafia hasn't in a hundred years! 
RICHIE Yeah, you'd know, sitting here, having never been on the (street) - 
US ATTORNEY Lou, get this fucking kike out of here - 
Richie goes for him and lands several punches before Toback and the others can pull him off. 
299 OMIT                                                              299 OMIT 
300        INT/EXT. AIRPORT HANGAR OFFICE - DAY                             300 
Richie and Toback walk briskly across the lobby - 
TOBACK He was out of line, Richie. 
Richie isn't really listening. Strides past his detectives on his way out of the building. To Spearman - TOBACK It's over.   You're shut down. 
Toback watches as the detectives follow after Richie striding toward his car. 
301 - 302 OMIT                                                 301 - 302 OMIT

B303       INT. FRANK'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT                                   B303 
Frank slaps a cartridge into the butt of a pistol. 
FRANK Ten million dollars means nothing to me. (CONT) 
B303   CONTINUED:                                                     B303 
Ana stares at the floor. It all just seems to get worse and worse. They had their chance to get out and missed it. 
RICHIE V/O Somewhere in the South tower. 
TOBACK You know that it's there.     You're sure. 
RICHIE V/O Positive. 324    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - SAME TIME                       324 
Richie, on a pay phone across down the street from the Projects, looks up at the dark South tower. 
RICHIE Lou. We're ready to go in there knowing there's a good chance we won't all come out. That's what we're willing to do. All I'm asking you to do get me a warrant. 
Silence on the other end of the line ... 
RICHIE We don't have a lot of time to fuck around - 
(CONT) 
324    CONTINUED:                                                     324 
TOBACK V/O I'll call in the warrant. And some backup. Don't go in before either gets there. 
This call disconnects. 
325    INT. APARTMENT, THE PROJECTS - MORNING                         325 
The girls spread and tape plastic sheeting to tabletops, then begin changing for work, which means undressing. 
326    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                          326 
Richie and his guys wait for the warrant by their cars. 
JONES How long we gonna wait for it? 
327    INT. APARTMENT, THE PROJECTS - MORNING                         327 
Pharmaceutical scales balance to their counterweights as the five naked, masked women cut the heroin with quinine to Frank's exacting standards. Red Top puts on some coffee. 
328    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                          328 
Richie stares down the street, waiting for whatever it is they're waiting for. Spearman looks at his watch. 
RICHIE It'll be here. 
329    INT. APARTMENT, THE PROJECTS - MORNING                         329 A paper-cutter blade slices a sheet of blue cellophane. The girls at the tables, with the expertise of Cuban cigar makers, wrap pieces of the cellophane like tobacco leaves around precisely-measured 1/4-ounce drifts of Black Magic. 
A330   EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING                                        A330 
Frank's car winds up the road of the cemetery. The surveillance car comes through the main gate and parks. 
330    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                          330 
Several black and white and undercover cars approach, sirens off. Toback himself climbs out of one of the cars and hands Richie the search warrant. 
331    EXT. STEPHEN CRANE PROJECTS - MORNING                        331 
The tall buildings cast long shadows of dread on every activity below, no matter how routine: A woman pushing a stroller, guys shooting hoops, a couple arguing, kids on bikes, old men resting on a graffiti-covered bench. 
The unmarked cars drive slowly through it all. The place teeters on the brink of violence you can feel as gangs move under the shadow of the towers. 
332    INT. GROUND FLOOR, SOUTH TOWER, THE PROJECTS - DAY           332 
Richie removes the cover plate of an elevator, cuts the wires, disengaging it, then leads the Amigos, followed by more detectives to a stairwell. The place is like Beirut. Debris-strewn, graffiti-covered. 
A333   EXT. CEMETERY - CONTINUED - DAY                             A333 
Frank walks past graves to Bumpy's. Replaces some dried flowers with fresh ones. Looks around for something to sit on. Sees some wooden folding chairs around a fresher grave nearby. Doc waits by the car in the distance. 
333    INT. STAIRWELL - FLOORS - SOUTH TOWER - DAY                  333 
Floor by floor, they work their way up the tower like commandos, the squalor and decay and hopelessness somehow intensifying the higher up they go. 
Reaching the 17th floor, they listen to a strange sound before easing the fire door open enough to see a kid on a Big Wheels pedalling straight at them. He passes and the sound fades. 
334    INT. 17TH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY                                334 
Half the apartment doors are gone. TVs and radios echo, voices argue, infants wail. The detectives come around a corner and see at the end of it: a couple of guys with a sawed-off shotguns sitting outside a closed door. 
They step back. Consider one other. Spearman volunteers with a nod, continues on alone as the others wait. He walks up to the guys with the guns. 
SPEARMAN I got to talk to Teddy. 
GUY WITH GUN Get the fuck out of here. 
(CONT) 
334   CONTINUED:                                                     334 
SPEARMAN What the fuck is that? I got business with Teddy and it's none of your fuckin business except to knock on the fuckin door and get him. 
As the guy stands, pumping the shotgun, Spearman yanks it hard against his throat like a garrote, forcing him to the floor. The shotgun explodes, showering plaster and pellets. Jones and Abruzzo are instantly all over the other guy as Richie swings the sledgehammer into the door - 
335   INT. APARTMENT, THE PROJECTS - CONTINUOUS                      335 
The door splinters - the room already in chaos - Teddy, panicked, runs for the bedroom - the detectives crash in yelling at the girls to get down - a shot from somewhere inside wings Abruzzo - Jones and Spearman firing back - crawling across the floor like an infantrymen - 
Richie comes into the darkened bedroom leading with his pistol. But Teddy's gone. He sees a tapestry of a tiger on a wall. Pulls at it, finds a big hole knocked into another dark apartment, climbs through, sees an open door - 
336   INT. THE PROJECTS BUILDING - CONTINUOUS                        336

"The Game", early draft, by John Brancato & Michael Ferris 
The Game 
by 
John Brancato & Michael Ferris 
REVISED October 19, 1995 
A1. TITLES OVER "HOME MOVIES" from the 1960's -- FLICKERING, GRAINY, HAND-HELD, KODACHROME COLORS.  MUSIC OVER. 
1.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (HOME MOVIES) 
A SEVEN-YEAR-OLD BIRTHDAY BOY with a blindfold spins round and round, the HANDS of OTHER CHILDREN keep him spinning.  MAIN TITLE. It's a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.  The dizzy boy is given a strip of felt, and the CAMERA follows as he stumbles toward a large cardboard donkey.  He pins the tail on its nose. 
2. QUICK, RAGGED CUTS-- the BOY blows out candles... opens gifts... a CLOWN ties balloon animals.  CHILDREN, MAIDS and BUTLERS hover about; there's even a real-live PONY.  The party take splace in the gardens of a massive Pacific Heights MANSION. 
3. THE BOY is SCHUYLER VAN ORTON (7), and this is his birthday party.  He's a serious-looking child, who adjusts his glasses as he poses for a shot with his mother, MRS. VAN ORTON, a stiff-looking society matron.  A NANNY brings over an INFANT and gently places the baby in Schuyler's arms.  Schuyler is ultra-careful, over- whelmed by the responsibility of holding his tiny BROTHER (DAVID). 
4. THE BOY and the other children sit spellbound, watching a magic show in the front GARDEN-- a MAGICIAN waves a colored handkerchief, a DOVE FLIES OUT.  CAMERA FOLLOWS the bird UP toward the house... 
5. THE CAMERA FINDS MR. VAN ORTON, a pinched, depressive man of about 40, wearing glasses.  He stands on a high balcony at the top story of the mansion, in a bathrobe, smoking a cigarette.  The unseen photographer ZOOMS IN jerkily on the man.  When he realizes he's being photographed, Mr. Van Orton turns his back and goes inside the house.  The film SOLARIZES and runs into LEADER-- 
CUT TO: 
6.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  D A Y  (PRESENT DAY) 
TITLES CONTINUE.  Early morning, the same mansion (ideally an ornate Victorian or Arts & Crafts).  The landscaping has changed, there are some modern touches, such as an iron gate surrounding the carriageway, a black 500-class MERCEDES in the drive. 
MUSIC DOWN, SEGUE to a CNN NEWS BROADCAST OVER as the CAMERA MOVES IN ON THE UPPER BALCONY where we'd seen Mr. Van Orton earlier... it's now COVERED and GLASSED-IN.  We move THROUGH THE GLASS... 
7.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B E D R O O M  -  D A Y 
TRACK THROUGH a large master bedroom; neat, masculine and Spartan, free weights, a treadmill.  Atop the bed a LAPTOP COMPUTER runs STOCK QUOTES.  A LARGE-SCREEN TV plays UNWATCHED, a familiar CNN ANCHOR (we'll assume BERNARD SHAW).  The Bang & Olufsen CLOCK RADIO CLICKS ON, 6:30 am; CLASSICAL MUSIC now DUELS with the TV report. HAND-ANNOTATED PAPERWORK and STOCK READOUTS cover a NIGHT TABLE, where the ringing multi-line TELEPHONE JOINS the cacophony. 
END TITLES as we MOVE TOWARD a DOOR, it's open a crack-- from this adjacent bath we hear the SOUND OF A SHOWER RUNNING... 
8.  I N T .   M A S T E R   B A T H R O O M  -  D A Y 
In the steam-filled bathroom, we make out SCHUYLER VAN ORTON, now 38.  He's handsome, fit and apparently in complete control of his world.  He steps out of the shower, wraps a towel around himself and grabs the BATHROOM PHONE. 
SCHUYLER (on phone) Van Orton... Yes, it is my birthday, Bob, is that why you called...?  Ah... No, I'm not carrying Alan Baer another inch, fuck him, BG Lumber is history... 
As he speaks, he continues his morning ritual-- hair combing, Q- tips, etc.  (Schuyler is a man in almost constant motion.) 
9.  E X T.   S A N   F R A N C I S C O   S T R E E T S  -  D A Y 
The black Mercedes moves quickly through morning traffic. 
10.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   C A R  -  D A Y 
SCHUYLER is on his car phone, NEWS RADIO LOW in BG, maneuvering aggressively through traffic.  His laptop RUNS in the passenger seat, its cellular antenna up. 
SCHUYLER (on carphone) Ignore the rumors, Alan, you know me, of course I'm behind Baer- Grace a hundred per cent... great, see you at the shareholders' meeting next month... 
He hangs up and HONKS at another driver, displaying no emotion. 
11.  I N T .   V A N   O R T O N   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y 
TRACK WITH SCHUYLER through an elegant suite of offices.  He passes a discreet sign: "THE VAN ORTON GROUP."  Schuyler is on a cell- phone, carrying the laptop, trailed by MARIA, his middle-aged secretary.  She bears paperwork and patiently awaits his attention. 
SCHUYLER (on cellphone) I've got buyers for the BG paper mill, goose the lawyers, final papers in three weeks... sure it's sad, but an old dog loses its teeth and pisses itself, you put it to sleep... 
As Schuyler walks, he's GREETED by passing UNDERLINGS, whom he ignores.  He SHUTS OFF the phone, Maria hands him a couple of items, follows him into his office. 
MARIA Carol from the museum called. She's sending architect's sketches of the wing... 
12.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  D A Y 
The office is large, tasteful, reeks of old money.  A window overlooks the San Francisco skyline and the Bay. 
MARIA That Business Week reporter called again-- 
SCHUYLER Tell him to fuck himself.  Nicely. 
MARIA (awkwardly) --and, um, somebody who identified himself as, um, P.P. Willy. 
SCHUYLER FREEZES at this, stares at her. 
MARIA Sorry, I figured it was a crank, but he swore you'd know who he was.  He wanted to meet you for lunch, I told him you had appointments all-- 
SCHUYLER Cancel.  Cancel the whole afternoon. 
MARIA But you-- 
SCHUYLER Do it.  Did he leave a number? 
MARIA No.  He just said he'd be at Leo's in the Haight.  At noon. 
Maria hands him a slip of paper, lingers, awaiting explanation... 
SCHUYLER That's all, Maria. 
She heads out quickly.  Schuyler stares at the slip, then turns to look out the window, lost in thought. 
She moves off as Schuyler tries to order, raising a finger-- 
SCHUYLER Just a cheesebur... how'd you find this place? 
DAVID Old connection used to meet me here.  So you gonna call 'em? 
SCHUYLER (a sigh, carefully) You know, David, this is sweet, but it's an awfully busy time, I'm in the midst of a delicate liquidation-- 
DAVID (mimicking him bitterly) "A delicate liquidation," God, you would do this... 
SCHUYLER David-- 
DAVID We can't get together once without you making me feel like shit.  That's important to you, isn't it? 
SCHUYLER What are you talking about? 
DAVID Forget about it, don't bother. 
David slumps in his seat, won't meet Schuyler's eyes. 
SCHUYLER Are you still on medication...? 
David glares at him.  With the impeccable timing of all waitresses, CHRISTINE appears, chipper. 
CHRISTINE You guys know what you want? 
DAVID Go away. 
She curls her lip and departs before Schuyler can open his mouth. He sighs, resigned to the idea of not eating.  Calmly: 
DAVID I just thought you'd like it.  I did, it was a blast, best thing that ever happened to me.  And for your information, I'm not on anything anymore, I'm not even seeing a shrink, I'm in a better place than I've ever been, I'm even happy-- but that's something else I wouldn't be able to explain to you. 
SCHUYLER OK, OK, I'll give them a call... 
DAVID Whatever. 
SCHUYLER Look, take a pill.  Just be normal for thirty seconds and tell me what this is.  I hate surprises. 
DAVID I know. 
David WINKS, puts a finger to his lips-- not another word. 
CLOSE as Schuyler slips the brightly-colored CARD into his pocket.

14.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   O F F I C E   B U I L D I N G  -  N I G H T 
ESTABLISH the moonlit exterior of an older, classy building in downtown San Francisco.  MOVE IN on a high window, one of the few LIT at this hour.  We hear the SOUND OF A PHONE CHIRPING OVER. 
lS.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T 
COMPUTERS run, stacks of PAPERWORK, etc. PHONE continues to RING. 
FIND SCHUYLER as he punches the SPEAKER: 
SCHUYLER Van Orton. 
ELIZABETH (on speaker) Hello, Schuyler. 
ELIZABETH is Schuyler's ex-wife-- an earnest woman, a stranger to subtlety.  STAY WITH SCHUYLER, who half-smiles, looks at his watch. 
SCHUYLER Eleven forty, you almost didn't make it. 
ELIZABETH (on speaker) I always call on your birthday. How was it? 
SCHUYLER Oh, the usual, big party, circus clowns, naked lady in a cake... 
ELIZABETH (on speaker) (slight chuckle; serious) How are you, Sky? 
She has the concerned, forthright tone of a "recovery person," someone who's been through a lot of therapy and wants to reach out. Schuyler GRIMACES, then mimics the tone: 
SCHUYLER I'm just fine.  How are you? 
ELIZABETH (on speaker) It wasn't a trick question. Thirty-eight, I thought that might be a-- a difficult year for you... 
SCHUYLER Hm?  Just another birthday, another year closer to death. 
ELIZABETH (on speaker) I meant-- because of your father. 
SCHUYLER Oh that's right, I guess he was 38, wasn't he?  I hadn't thought about it, to tell the truth, but thank you for the reminder. 
ELIZABETH (on speaker) Why do I call you... 
SCHUYLER I honestly don't know, but it's a nice change of pace from talking to your attorneys.  So, still working at the hospice? 
ELIZABETH (on speaker) Mm-hmm, couple days a week... 
SCHUYLER Great, that's great.  Well, give my regards to Dr. Mel and the baby-- 
ELIZABETH (on speaker) She has a little brother on the way... we just did the ultrasound. 
SCHUYLER Really.  Congratulations-- two kids, an official nuclear family, you must be very happy. 
ELIZABETH (on speaker) We are, Sky.  Very happy. 
Partitioned work areas, terminals, clutter and disarray.  Office doors open off a reception area.  CRS EMPLOYEES move about hectically.  Schuyler enters, wanders about for a moment, confused. A friendly female RECEPTIONIST glances up from her desk. 
RECEPTIONIST Can I help you? 
SCHUYLER Is this Consumer Recreation Services?  I have an appointment, the name's Van Orton. 
The woman flips through an appointment book with a logo, CRS.  IN BG, JIM FEINGOLD pays a CHINESE DELIVERY GUY for a BAG OF FOOD. 
RECEPTIONIST Hm... I don't seem to-- 
SCHUYLER Schuyler Van Orton, I called last week. 
The woman shakes her head.  FEINGOLD slows as he crosses past Schuyler, carrying the bag.  He's 30-40, a no-nonsense engineer, looks a bit dull, but he exudes competence and trustworthiness. 
FEINGOLD Problem? 
RECEPTIONIST This gentlemen says he has an appointment, but... 
Feingold glances at Schuyler, shrugs. 
FEINGOLD Van Orton, huh?  I'll take him. (shakes his hand) Jim Feingold, v. p. in charge of engineering and data analysis. 
The man leads Schuyler to a row of open boxes on the floor, looks in a couple, then finds what he's after.  He snatches up a couple of pages, hands them to Schuyler.  Then he finds a clipboard on the floor, tosses it to him like a frisbee. 
FEINGOLD Sorry about the chaos, we're still in the process of moving... follow me, I've got an office around here someplace. 
He reaches into a box of PENS, passes one to Schuyler. 
CLOSE ON PEN-- the CRS LOGO. 
CUT TO: 
29.  I N T .   F E I N G O L D ' S   O F F I C E / H A L L W A Y  -  D A Y 
A modern, dramatic office.  Swoopy furniture, imposing ART, all very cool-looking.  Feingold moves behind the desk, unpacks a couple of white cartons. 
FEINGOLD I can't remember the last time I ate in a restaurant, all I do is work... 
SCHUYLER sits on a couch, looking at the forms. 
SCHUYLER I know what you mean.  Look-- what is all this? 
The fast-talking Feingold moves energetically through the office, occasionally picking at his food or poking at the air with chopsticks-- he's a bit hyper and fidgety in general. 
FEINGOLD Application, MMPI and TAT tests, financial statement... (indicating food) Want some?  Tung Hoy, best in Chinatown... (as Schuyler shakes his head) The tests serve a threefold purpose. First off, are you right for us? Are we right for you?  Unfortunately, there's a limited number of slots-- 
SCHUYLER Let's back up here-- 
FEINGOLD (over him) B, we need an idea of your abilities and limitations, what turns you on, and off.  Numero tres, our insurance company requires it. (a beat, studying Schuyler) You're familiar with our service, aren't you? 
SCHUYLER Not at all.  What are you selling? 
FEINGOLD Well... it's a game. 
SCHUYLER A game. 
FEINGOLD Recharges the batteries, gets you off the treadmill, it's an experience.  Sort of a-- vacation for the guy who's been everywhere. 
SCHUYLER This really doesn't sound like my sort of-- 
Feingold sits on the edge of his desk, arms crossed, nodding and smiling condescendingly-- he raises a hand to stop Schuyler. 
SCHUYLER What's so amusing? 
FEINGOLD Nothing.  I know who you are. You're David Van Orton's brother, he got you in here. 
SCHUYLER So. 
FEINGOLD (remembering fondly) David was-- impressive, one of the better I've seen.  But frankly, I can see you're not the type. 
SCHUYLER The type. 
FEINGOLD You know, a player. 
SCHUYLER I'm not a player. 
FEINGOLD I don't mean anything personal by it-- I know you're an important guy, powerful guy, you're used to being on top.  It's just, this isn't for everyone.  Not everyone can handle it. 
SCHUYLER (nearly losing it) What kind of fu-- game is this? 
FEINGOLD The ultimate fucking game.  I wish I could tell you more, but it's different every time. (rising) Thanks for coming in-- 
SCHUYLER (doesn't move) I'm not an idiot.  I see what you're doing.  First the vague yet intriguing pitch, then I'm supposed to feel like my manhood's in question because I'm not up for, what, some motivational role-playing fantasy nonsense-- 
FEINGOLD Interesting, you don't know the first thing about it but you've already decided what it is... Listen, I don't wanna waste any more-- 
SCHUYLER Please, Jim, cut the hard-to-get shit.  I've got the afternoon free, I'll take your silly tests. 
Feingold cocks his head, reappraising him.  Then, with a smile, he calls to an attractive young WOMAN passing in the hall; Schuyler, meanwhile, flips through the pages of the tests. 
FEINGOLD Ms. Nelson, are you busy?  We need someone to run Mr. Van Orton. 
MS. NELSON This way, sir... 
As she leads Schuyler out the door, Feingold WINKS at him. 
This gets Schuyler's attention, he squints toward the television. 
BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) The U. S. geological service has detected a massive disturbance in the earth's crust deep beneath the northern segment of the San Andreas fault... 
SCHUYLER scrambles for his glasses, as Shaw struggles to continue. 
BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) ...they have issued a warning that a major earthquake of magnitude eight or greater is likely to hit the San Francisco Bay area within... (a beat) Oh my God, the next fifteen minutes-- 
SCHUYLER sits on the bed, breathes hard, stares at the tube. 
BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) There is no time for an evacuation. The federal government has issued the following instructions for all residents of central and northern California... 
SCHUYLER is freaking out, paces frantically, moves toward a phone-- who's he going to call?  He makes a low MOAN. 
SHAW'S voice CRACKS, he speaks very rapidly. 
BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) Locate emergency shut-offs for all power and gas-- 
SCHUYLER starts moving out of the room-- 
BERNARD SHAW (cont., on TV) Wait, there's no time for that-- just stay away from windows and doors-- 
SCHUYLER doubles back, avoiding a window, his panic mounting-- 
BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV) Find a heavy piece of furniture such as a desk or table and get under it-- 
SCHUYLER looks around, sees no such appropriate spot in the room. 
BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV) If no such furniture is immediately available, go to a window or doorway-- 
SCHUYLER blinks, hesitates starts to move toward the doar-- 
BERNARD sHAW (cant., on TV) But first turn off all power and gas. Crouch in a comfortable position, put your head between your knees and cover it with your arms-- 
SCHUYLER, confused, crouches as instructed-- 
BERNARD SHAW (cant., on TV) Then KISS YOUR LILY-WHITE ASS GOODBYE! 
On this last line, Shaw's voice starts to ECHO and CHANGE. 
SCHUYLER rises, staring at the TV, mouth agape. 
SHAW WINKS.  His VOICE is utterly transformed. 
BERNARD SHAW (on TV) Howdy Sky. 
HIS FACE RIPPLES and MORPHS into a SKULL, it's becoming clear that this is a computer-generated Bernard shaw. 
CYBERSHAW (on TV) Que pasa? 
As CYBERSHAW speaks, his face will continue to transform, sometimes back to a recognizable human state, other times into abstract images, a talking piano, a dog, etc. 
CYBERSHAW (on TV) Welcome to the Game! Congratulations on your decision to let Consumer Recreation Services entertain you. 
The combination of relief, amazement and anger is a bit much for Schuyler to absorb.  Smiling sickly: 
SCHUYLER Fuckers! 
CYBERSHAW (on TV) This might be a good time to lay out a few ground rules, help you enjoy your adventure.  You've received the first key.  There will be others. Pay attention-- you never know where you'll find 'em, you never know when you'll need 'em, so keep 'em with you at all times... 
As he speaks, Schuyler reaches for the gold key on his bedside table.  He starts putting it onto his keychain. 
ON TV SCREEN-- below CyberShaw, a PHONE NUMBER SCROLLS PAST. 
CYBERSHAW (on TV) You might want to write this number down, it's the CRS hotline, operators are standing by to assist... but please don't call to ask what the object of the game is-- figuring that out is the object of the game... 
SCHUYLER has snatched up the CRS pen to write down the number-- it doesn't work.  SWEARING, he tosses it aside, grabs another. 
ON TV, CyberShaw MORPHS back into the original Bernard Shaw. There's a quick VISUAL GLITCH on the tube as the original TV feed resumes-- Bernard Shaw is delivering a normal news story. 
BERNARD SHAW (on TV) --reaction on wall Street was muted following the Fed's announcement of... 
SCHUYLER is taken with the display of electronic pyrotechnics, in spite of himself.  He hits the speaker button on his phone, dials. 
OPERATOR VOICE (filter) You've reached CRS... 
SCHUYLER Yeah, this is pretty impressive but listen-- 
OPERATOR VOICE (filter) Our office is closed.  Please call back during business hours. (BEEP) 
SCHUYLER My name is Schuyler Van Orton, my game just started.  Look, this is a bad time, I'm about to leave town-- 
A DIAL TONE, CRS doesn't take messages.  Schuyler sighs, HANGS UP. 
44.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 
SCHUYLER crouches by a coaxial cable line emerging from the side of the house.  He fingers a box with a miniature LOOP and RABBIT EAR ANTENNA that's been spliced into the line with a tiny S-shaped WIRE.  He starts to unscrew it, then thinks twice, heads back in. 
WIDER, as Schuyler enters his mansion, a GIBBOUS MOON OVERHEAD. 
CUT TO: 
45.  E X T .   S E A - T A C   A I R P O R T  -  D A Y 
Mist in the air, a jet taxis to a terminal. 
SCHUYLER Never mind... we'll just have to go with the earlier draft. 
In BG, one exec picks up a page, WHISPERS to an ASSISTANT, who moves out of the room.  Schuyler moves to his briefcase.  It's LOCKED.  He starts patting his pockets. 
BAER Can't find your keys? 
Baer has a malevolent expression.  Schuyler looks at him. 
SCHUYLER Where are they. 
BAER Up your ass? 
A couple of execs stifle chuckles.  Schuyler's suspicions mount. 
SCHUYLER Up my ass, very funny... 
His eyes drift to a piece of CORPORATE STATIONARY on the table in front of him.  He picks it up: 
INSERT - UNDER BAER-GRACE LETTERHEAD we see a handscrawled note: "CRS CALLED."  We don't see what's written below. 
SCHUYLER is reeling, paranoia confirmed. 
SCHUYLER I don't-- OK.  OK, you're with CRS... 
Baer stares at him blankly.  Schuyler puts a hand over his eyes, seems disoriented, trying to piece it all together. 
SCHUYLER So the game, it's just a screen, to blow this deal... 
BAER I'm not following you. 
SCHUYLER Like hell you aren't.  How did you get my brother involved, that's unforgivable. 
The assembled execs are looking at Schuyler in utter confusion.  As he speaks, the ASSISTANT returns with some PAPERWORK.  Schuyler stares at him menacingly.  Hesitantly: 
ASSISTANT Um... sorry to interrupt.  We've been having some trouble with this fax, so they re-sent the material. It's all OK now. 
The assistant comes over, cheerfully places the crucial documents in front of Schuyler.  The assistant fishes in his pocket. 
ASSISTANT Oh and Mr. Van Orton-- are these yours?  The pilot found 'em on the floor of the chopper... 
Schuyler gingerly takes the KEYS which the assistant holds out, looks from them to the paperwork.  Then he glances back at the handwritten note on the table: 
INSERT NOTE:  It actually reads "CBS CALLED."  (Schuyler's thumb or a Post-It note covered the base of the B before, making it look like an R.)  It continues "Re: Interview with Alan B. on Sun..." 
SCHUYLER takes a breath, reassembles his composure and consults his watch.  He rises, anxious to put the last few minutes behind him. 
SCHUYLER Everything seems to be in order. Please disregard my last comments. The shareholders meeting is about to get underway... Shall we? 
He heads for the door.  As he leaves, the execs exchange looks. 
CUT TO: 
51.  I N T .   S E A - T A C   T E R M I N A L  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler wanders through the terminal, carrying his bags, glancing periodically at the DEPARTURES monitor and the clock.  His manner now has changed, he eyes every PASSERBY, especially the ODD ONES. 
P. A. VOICE (filter) Flight 177 to San Francisco is now boarding at Gate 14... 
Suddenly a leg is thrust out from behind an advertising kiosk, Schuyler TRIPS and goes sprawling.  The Rasta Man steps out, now wearing SUNGLASSES with PINK LENSES. 
RASTA MAN Shit mon sorry oughta pay more attention. 
Schuyler gets up, dusts himself off.  As calmly as possible: 
SCHUYLER Listen, I quit. 
RASTA MAN Free at last... you won't be needin' this, then. 
He snatches up the briefcase, dances back a few paces.  Schuyler speaks as if to a child. 
SCHUYLER No, cretin.  I'm quitting the game. 
The rasta man keeps backing away, puts a hand to his ear. 
RASTA MAN Wha's that, mon?  I didna hear you. 
Schuyler is pursuing the man, walking faster and faster. 
SCHUYLER I said I-- shit! 
The rasta turns and RUNS, Schuyler bolts after him, unable to believe this is happening.  They draw a lot of looks during the brief chase through the terminal, the suited businessman, garment bag flapping behind him, in pursuit of the crazy rasta. 
RASTA MAN Help, help!  The mon is crazy! 
He runs into a MEN'S ROOM, Schuyler follows a moment later. 
52.  I N T .   A I R P O R T   M E N ' S   R O O M  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler has the rasta cornered now-- but he doesn't have the briefcase.  Both are out of breath.  PISSING MEN look wary. 
SCHUYLER Where is it? 
RASTA MAN Got something better. 
The rasta men holds out a SHINY KEY on a chain.  Schuyler narrows his eyes, he's trying not to lose control of his temper. 
CHRISTINE notices him for the first time. 
CHRISTINE Asshole, just send me the goddamn dry-cleaning bill.  Could you--? 
She waves a hand at him, "go away" and ducks out of view, finishing dressing into punk-grungy street clothes.  She SLAMS the locker, starts to push past him, pulling on her backpack bag. 
SCHUYLER Don't you have something for me? 
CHRISTINE Uh-huh sure, here you go. 
She puts her hand into her side pocket, pulls it out with her middle finger extended, moving away from him in a hurry. Schuyler's face falls-- he made another mistake. 
SCHUYLER Wait, you really work here-- 
CHRISTINE Not anymore, thanks to you. 
She's out the SWINGING kitchen door.  Schuyler absorbs his blunder for a moment, then hurries after her. 
56.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y 
Schuyler catches up as Christine hurries toward a MUNI station, LIGHTING a cigarette.  A few PEDESTRIANS come off the steps from the arriving elevated train in this residential SF neighborhood. 
SCHUYLER Slow down-- you don't understand, I thought it was a gag. 
CHRISTINE No, you don't understand.  I carry mace and I know how to use it. 
She reaches into her purse/backpack, Schuyler backs off. 
SCHUYLER I was only trying to apologize. 
CHRISTINE Shit, it's in here somewhere-- 
SCHUYLER Fine. 
He starts to move away, then they both hear GASPING O. S.-- 
ON THE STEPS, a HEAVY MAN, 60, in a coat and tie has collapsed, struggling for breath, very pale.  Christine and Schuyler are the only pedestrians around now. 
CHRISTINE Shit-- 
She rushes to help the guy, loosening his tie-- he JOLTS. 
SCHUYLER looks up at them dubiously, brushing a scrap of food still clinging to his suit. 
CHRISTINE reaches in to clear the guy's throat, starting CPR.  She shoots a look at Schuyler. 
CHRISTINE You got a fucking phone, call an ambulance! 
Schuyler approaches slowly, pulling out his phone, studying the guy as Christine gives him mouth-to-mouth. 
SCHUYLER This is just too weird-- it can't be real-- 
CHRISTINE You really are insane! 
SCHUYLER leans close to look at the man. 
ON THE MAN'S FACE-- sweating, contorted, unnaturally pale, his eyes rolling back as he GAGS his last... 
CHRISTINE grabs the phone away from Schuyler, dials. 
CHRISTINE We need an ambulance, guy's having a heart attack near the MUNI station at 5th and Market-- (to Schuyler) What's the number on this thing?! 
SCHUYLER I don't give it out-- (off her horrified look) 
CHRISTINE 731-5723-- yeah, thanks-- 
She stuffs the phone in a pocket and pumps the man's chest, returns to the mouth-to-mouth.  Schuyler looks around uncomfortably, starting to believe this is a real heart attack. 
SCHUYLER Is there anything I can do? 
CHRISTINE ignores him, all attention on saving this guy's life... 
56A. WIDE as an AMBULANCE pulls up, SIREN BLARING.  A couple of MALE PARAMEDICS hurry out with a stretcher. 
ON THE STEPS, the two PARAMEDICS lift the unconscious HEAVY MAN onto the stretcher while Christine and Schuyler stand aside.  Both have small EARPIECES that look like hearing aids, with wires into their clothes.  Throughout the following, there's a lot of MEDICAL BUSINESS-- feeding the victim OXYGEN, giving him INJECTIONS, etc. 
PARAMEDIC #1 (to Schuyler) Could you come with us, help us fill out a few forms-- 
SCHUYLER No!  I have work to do-- 
CHRISTINE I'll go. 
She climbs into the back, they start to shut the doors. 
SCHUYLER Wait a minute, you've got my phone-- 
He climbs in to get it back, they SLAM THE DOORS and start moving. 
THE AMBULANCE peels out.  We now see the LOGO on the back: "CITYWIDE RESCUE SYSTEMS," with the C, R and S in RED. 
57.  I N T .   A M B U L A N C E  -  D A Y 
The PARAMEDICS are intent on the gasping man.  The SIREN BLARES, a bit MUFFLED in here.  Schuyler, looking out the back, is extremely pissed, makes a fist and almost punches the wall of the ambulance. 
CHRISTINE Chill, will you?! 
She LOSES HER FOOTING on a slippery surface, falls, sliding down a gentle SLOPE. 
CHRISTINE Help! 
SCHUYLER follows.  FALLING himself.  They try to reach toward each other for purchase, but it's no good, the slope is getting steeper. 
58A. In a moment SCHUYLER tumbles on top of Christine in a four- foot deep round CHILDREN'S POOL, but it isn't full of water. There's a bit of BLACK LIGHT here, enough to make out-- 
--COCKROACHES, thousands of them, a TEEMING ROIL OF INSECTS in a CHURNING LIQUID.  There's a BUZZING NOISE, both SCREAM. 
CHRISTINE Aaggh!  BUGS!! 
SCHUYLER quickly helps lift Christine out.  She starts to pull him upward, but-- 
SCHUYLER Where are the glasses?! 
CHRISTINE Fuck the glasses! 
SCHUYLER We can't get out of here without them! 
He steels himself and rummages amidst the bugs, about to get sick, finally coming up with the glasses.  He shakes them free of INSECTS and clambers out to join Christine, who's GASPING and brushing the bugs off of her.  SCHUYLER puts on the glasses and holds up a BUG. 
SCHUYLER They're rubber.  Hold onto me, I'll get us out of here. 
CHRISTINE Ha! 
SCHUYLER Fine, stay. 
CHRISTINE No! 
She grabs his arm; both are now covered in MUCK from the bug soup. 
SCHUYLER What's your favorite color? 
CHRISTINE ...Blue? 
He takes off the glasses, puts them on her.  She looks around. 
HER POV-- the RAINBOW of COLORED LINES on the FLOOR... 
CHRISTINE Wow... OK, this is kinda cool.  Hey! 
SCHUYLER slips the glasses off her, puts them back on. 
SCHUYLER Sorry, it's my game.  But we'll take blue. 
HIS POV-- a BLUE LINE moves in a snaking path ahead of them, going in circles now and then, INTERSECTING or moving PARALLEL to other colors, up a series of ramps.  This space sometimes resembles a PARKING GARAGE, scmetimes a SEWER or a STEAM TUNNEL. 
CHRISTINE keeps a hand on Schuyler as he follows the path. 
CHRISTINE Talk about the blind leading the blind... what's your name anyway? 
SCHUYLER Sky Van Orton. 
CHRISTINE Sky?  Were your folks hippies or something? 
SCHUYLER Far from it. 
CHRISTINE I'm Christine Kaminsky. 
SCHUYLER Nice to meet you. 
58B. LATER, CHRISTINE almost hugs Schuyler now, as they move in a seemingly random pattern in the darkness. 
SCHUYLER It's a company called Consumer Recreation Services, CRS.  I never know what's gonna happen next. 
CHRISTINE Well, who does. 
SCHUYLER Until recently, I had a pretty good idea... Duck. 
The BLUE LINE has led them into a NARROW TUNNEL, soon they're crawling on hands and knees. 
CHRISTINE So are you like a serious masochist, or just really, really bored? 
SCHUYLER I'm sorry, you shouldn't have been dragged into this. 
CHRISTINE Well... I have to tell you something.  Some guy came into Leo's yesterday, showed me your picture, offered me 250 bucks to spill that food on you. 
SCHUYLER Ah. 
CHRISTINE Said it was a practical joke.  I figured what the hell, I can use the money-- I got him up to 500. I hated that fucking job anyway-- 
SCHUYLER Wait, so the heart attack, you knew that was a joke too-- 
CHRISTINE No!  It scared the shit out of me-- 
SCHUYLER But that CPR routine-- 
CHRISTINE I used to be a lifeguard. 
SCHUYLER (points) We're getting somewhere... 
The TUNNEL has opened up again.  There's even a tiny bit of VISIBLE LIGHT now.  He takes off the glasses, gives them to her. 
HER POV-- the COLORED LINES are all joining up from different directions.  A few steps onward they all converge at a point, like the spokes of a wheel, at a WHITE SPOT on the ground... 
63.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   O F F I C E  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler emerges, shoes in hand. 
SCHUYLER Basically.  Beats working, huh? 
Christine sits on his desk, with her bag slung over her shoulder, eating an APPLE.  She slides off the desk, flirting rather bluntly. 
CHRISTINE You don't look so bad, without the tie. 
SCHUYLER Look, I hope you haven't been too put out... I could probably get you another job, I have a stake in a couple of restaurants-- 
CHRISTINE I'm not much of a waitress, really. Y'know, today's been kind of-- 
SCHUYLER Can you type? 
CHRISTINE Kind of a turn-on, you know? (getting no response) I didn't mean-- just, the danger... Like fucking in a graveyard. 
SCHUYLER Mm.  So where do you live? 
Christine realizes her come-on is falling flat, she pulls back, tossing her unfinished apple in the trash. 
CHRISTINE Out in Concord, with my folks, unfortunately.  They're never gonna believe that I've been hanging out with a guy like you. 
SCHUYLER What do you mean? 
CHRISTINE Nothing, just-- most of the guys I see have tats, y'know? (off his confused look) Tattoos... 
SCHUYLER Of course.  We'd better head downstairs, the limo's waiting. 
Christine nods disappointedly as Schuyler moves to the door. 
CUT TO: 
64.  I N T .   L I M O  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler and Christine ride in silence in the back seat. 
CHRISTINE Mind if I smoke in here? 
SCHUYLER Yes. (leaning forward) Up here on the left. 
As the limo pulls over, he and Christine turn to each other.  It's a somewhat awkward moment. 
CHRISTINE So what's our next move?  I mean, in the game.  Obviously we need to figure out what that crank thing is for-- 
SCHUYLER I'm not playing anymore. 
CHRISTINE (disappointed) Why not? 
SCHUYLER I have a life.  Jack'll take you home, or wherever you want to go. 
CHRISTINE Yeah, maybe I'll get in a little ballroom dancing before bed-- 
The limo has stopped now.  Schuyler has started to open the door. 
CHRISTINE Wait, what about your clothes? 
SCHUYLER Forget it. 
CHRISTINE C'mon it's a brand new sweatshirt. 
So saying, she pulls it off.  She's wearing a black bra... a ROSE is tattooed on her shoulder.  Schuyler can't help but react.  She thrusts the shirt at him, he's half out of the car. 
SCHUYLER No, it's not-- just-- back from the cleaners. 
CHRISTINE (throatily) You dry clean your sweatshirts... 
He nods slightly... as he reaches to take it-- 
--CHRISTINE leans forward, cups the back of his head and gives him a LONG, HARD KISS. 
JACK THE DRIVER, middle-aged and trustworthy, turns and catches a glimpse of this, quickly turns away. 
CHRISTINE breaks the kiss, sinks back against the red leather seat, waiting for Schuyler to make the next move. 
CHRISTINE See ya. 
Schuyler nods again, torn.  She's looking at him expectantly.  He's clearly aroused, but this is such an inappropriate female.  Sadly, he waves a hand. 
SCHUYLER Good night. 
65.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler shuts the door, sweatshirt in hand, the dome light slowly DIMS OUT out on the crestfallen Christine-- we see her mouth a CURSE.  Schuyler moves toward his MBZ, the limo IDLING.  He's about to get inside when he sees a TICKET IN AN ENVELOPE under the windshield wiper.  He SNORTS-- insult to injury-- tosses it on the dash as he climbs in. 
66.  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   M B Z  -  N I G H T 
He sits behind the wheel, watching the lights of the limo disappear.  He sniffs the sweatshirt a moment, then STARTS at the sound of a MOTOR STARTING across the street. 
ANGLE THROUGH SIDE WINDOW-- an MBZ the same year, model and color as Schuyler's-- pulls away from the curb, Schuyler gets a glimpse of something REFLECTING STREET LIGHT in the window of the car-- a gun?  A camera with a long lens?  The car makes a quick U-turn and drives in the same direction as the limo. 
SCHUYLER, curious, STARTS THE ENGINE as if to pursue.  Then he glimpses the envelope on the dash out of the corner of his eye.  He doesn't put the car in gear, picks up the envelope instead... 
CLOSE ON ENVELOPE-- The words "OPEN ME" are printed in BLOCK LETTERS on the outside.  He opens it quickly-- there's no ticket inside, but he shakes out a RAINBOW-COLORED CONDOM in a clear wrapper and a NOTE in KIDNAPPER LETTERS:  "BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY." 
GIRL They said you'd figure out what to do with it. 
SCHUYLER takes it from her gingerly, undoes the bow, opens the lid: 
ANGLE IN COFFIN-- an ornate HATCHET with a KEY DESIGN on the blade. 
SCHUYLER REMOVES it from its QUILTED resting place.  THE GIRL backs away, nervous to see SCHUYLER with a weapon. 
SCHUYLER I'm supposed to carry a fucking hatchet around...?  Relax.  I don't want it. 
He drops the AXE and the COFFIN into the water with a SPLASH-- 
95PT. THEY GO UNDER and DISAPPEAR... 
CUT TO: 
96.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  D A Y 
Early morning, the RAIN has stopped-- a RAINBOW arcs behind the office building.  TWO COP CARS, marked and unmarked, pull up at the curb, lights FLASHING. 
97.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  D A Y 
Schuyler, in the clothes from the boat, and Plympton, his lawyer, are joined at the elevators by two plainclothes detectives-- BARNETT and GALLO-- and two UNIFORMS. 
PLYMPTON Thank you for your promptness, officers.  I'm Robert Plympton, Mr. Van Orton's attorney-- 
SCHUYLER Let's go.  Seventh floor. 
98.  I N T .   C R S   O F F I C E S  -  D A Y 
Schuyler enters, followed by the others.  He stops short, reacts. WIDE SHOT reveals-- the same offices, now entirely empty.  The partitions, the desks, everything has been removed.  A small amount of TRASH is scattered on the floor-- the move was evidently hasty. 
CUT TO: 
99. LATER.  UNIFORM #1 SPEAKS into his walkie-talkie, COP TALK; #2 pokes around in a box full of SHREDDED PAPER; Plympton CONFERS with Barnett, nods, then both of them cross to Schuyler, who sits on the carpet, back to an empty wall.  Barnett checks his notes. 
BARNETT Management company for the building said this floor hasn't been rented.  We checked with the Secretary of State and the county recorder, there's no listing of a "consumer research service." 
PLYMPTON Recreation service. 
BARNETT Right.  No sign of the boat or the girl.  Divers got the cab's vehicle ID, the company junked it a month ago. 
Gallo, who'd been talking on a phone IN BG, approaches. 
GALLO The numbers you gave us are disconnected, sir, this was the only address the phone company had.  And we found your car-- it's in impound. 
BARNETT I'm a little confused as to motive here.  You said your brother sent you to these people... 
SCHUYLER It's not his fault, he's unstable, he didn't know what he was doing-- 
BARNETT And they were supposed to show you a, a good time? 
GALLO (a cautioning look at Barnett) My guess is this Feingold guy's using an alias... is there anything else you can tell us about him? 
Schuyler spots an empty CHINESE FOOD CARTON crumpled in the corner. 
CLOSER as SCHUYLER picks up and fingers the container-- Chinese characters on it, the name TUNG HOY. 
SCHUYLER He likes Chinese food... 
BARNETT Don't worry, Mr. Van Orton, we'll get these jokers. 
SCHUYLER nods, unconvinced. 
CUT TO: 
100(NEW).  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   M A N S I O N  -  D A Y 
PLYMPTON pulls up in his LEXUS, SCHUYLER gets out wearily. 
PLYMPTON There's clearly a civil case once we locate the defendant... 
SCHUYLER Whatever. 
PLYMPTON Y'know, Sky, things are quiet since the closing-- you could take some time off. 
SCHUYLER sighs and nods, closes the car door and waves good-bye. He climbs the steps to his front door and Plympton pulls away. 
101(NEW).  I N T .   S C H U Y L E R ' S   F O Y E R  -  D A Y 
SCHUYLER enters and automatically reaches for a LIGHTSWITCH-- 
BLUE SPARKS leap to his fingers, the switch has been RIPPED OUT, leaving exposed WIRING. 
SCHUYLER CURSES and shakes his hand out.  He looks around in disbelief-- the walls are covered in GRAFFITI. 
"GAME OVER" is the first one we see in the foyer, above the HARLEQUIN, who still sits in the only upright chair... but now a GLOSSY BLACK AND WHITE PHOTO is stuck in its teeth. 
SCHUYLER pulls out the picture, looks at it, hand trembling-- 
A POLICE PHOTO of MR. VAN ORTON, his body sprawled in a pool of blood.  It's stamped "PROPERTY SFPD" in red... 
SCHUYLER Oh, God-- 
SCHUYLER tosses the picture aside, moves into his living room-- 
DESK CLERK Mr. Van Orton.  Here's your credit card... and the maid found this under the bed... 
From under the desk he removes a small ATTACHE CASE, places it gingerly in front of Schuyler. 
SCHUYLER That isn't mine. 
DESK CLERK It has your initials on it, sir. 
SCHUYLER examines the case closely for the first time, sees the gold monogram, "S. V. O." 
DESK CLERK We'd just as soon you took it with you, in any event... and in the future, you might consider choosing another hotel for your... 
The man trails off and moves away. 
SCHUYLER I've never been here before in my life! 
The man ignores him now.  Schuyler pockets his credit card, thinks a beat, then grabs the briefcase. 
SCENES 103-104 DELETED 
105.  I N T .   C O M P A N Y   L I M O  -  D A Y 
JACK drives, Schuyler in back, studying the open briefcase in his lap.  He seems extremely upset, fighting to maintain his wits... 
SCHUYLER Jack... the woman you took home the other night, where did you go? 
JACK (puzzled) Out to Concord... 
SCHUYLER I know, what was the address? 
JACK is a bit nervous, he doesn't want to piss off the boss. 
JACK Mmm... it was... Beulah Drive, I think, yeah, offa Oakdale... but didn't you-- never mind. 
SCHUYLER What? 
JACK Just-- I thought you followed us there.  There was a black 500SE behind us the whole way, I just assumed... 
SCHUYLER Shit.  Shit!  It wasn't me, Jack. 
JACK Of course, sir.  It was a white house, I remember... big tree in the front... with one of those, you know, tire swings... 
SCHUYLER Jack, I'm serious.  It wasn't me. 
JACK It wasn't you, sir. 
Schuyler looks at the man, who stares straight ahead, not believing him for a second.  Schuyler shakes his head, looks down at the open briefcase in his lap. 
ANGLE IN BRIEFCASE-- a set of HANDCUFFS, assorted BONDAGE GEAR... and a few BLURRY POLAROID PHOTOS, showing a NAKED WOMAN with a LEATHER MASK chained to a bed.  ONE SHOT shows her shoulder clearly-- we see a ROSE TATTOO. 
CUT TO: 
106.  E X T .   I M P O U N D   L O T  -  D A Y 
A female IMPOUND WORKER with paperwork leads SCHUYLER through a maze of SMASHED CARS, etc.  IN BG, the COMPANY LIMO pulls away. 
IMPOUND WORKER Triple A changed your tire... bad blow-out was it?  Anyone hurt? 
Schuyler shakes his head.  They've reached his MBZ. 
IMPOUND WORKER Oh.  Just... we were a little curious about the mess in the back... 
SCHUYLER bends down to look in the window. 
HIS POV-- THE BACKSEAT has been SLASHED.  A few SPLASHES OF BLOOD, not too much.  Schuyler's HARVARD SWEATSHIRT is torn and STAINED with blood, crumpled in a corner of the seat. 
SCHUYLER swallows, recovers quickly. 
SCHUYLER A friend's dog-- he'd been hit by a car, I drove him to the vet... (as the cop nods slowly) Golden retriever, beautiful animal. 
IMPOUND WORKER (handing Sky a receipt) He OK? 
SCHUYLER Too early to say. 
He quickly gets behind the wheel.

108.  E X T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   N E I G H B O R H O O D / H O U S E  -  E V E N I N G 
SCHUYLER'S MBZ cruises past rows of similar-looking, lower-middle- class homes, a pretty shabby neighborhood.  He parks the Benz.  A WHITE VAN is parked just up the street, a LOOP AND RABBIT EAR on the roof.  PAN to show THE DRIVER'S SIDE DOOR... A cartoonish logo with the CRS MAN holding a wrench by a TV SET in front of a RAINBOW, the words "CABLE REPAIR SPECIALISTS." 
ON THE HOUSE, MOVE from a WHITEWALL TIRE hanging on a rope from a tree to SCHUYLER as he RINGS the front doorbell of a WHITE HOUSE. 
AT THE DOOR, an older, working-class man in a T-shirt appears-- Christine's dad, MR. KAMINSKY. 
MR. KAMINSKY Yes? 
SCHUYLER Mr. Kaminsky?  Schuyler Van Orton-- 
MR. KAMINSKY Is that a name?  Look, I'm kinda busy. (starts to close the door) 
SCHUYLER You have a daughter named Christine?  I'm afraid she might be in danger. 
She kisses him, he doesn't open his mouth, neither shuts their eyes.  Then she gets up quickly, moves to a corner of the room. 
CHRISTINE (back in character, accented) OK, I know a good place we could go and like, be alone... 
She glances up quickly to indicate something on the ceiling-- 
ON CEILING, a large SMOKE DETECTOR with a RED LIGHT, a cable from it-- there's a small LENS in the center... A HIDDEN CAMERA. 
SCHUYLER looks at this, starting to rise.  She moves to a window, out of range of the camera, beckons him over. 
CHRISTINE It's a beautiful night, isn't it? 
Schuyler comes up beside her, she nods for him to look outside-- 
POV-- THROUGH WINDOW-- the CRS VAN.  Christine WHISPERS urgently: 
CHRISTINE There's four of them in the van, they're armed.  Just play along, I'll get us out of here-- 
SCHUYLER turns to her, his voice is tired. 
SCHUYLER Fuck you. (to surveillance camera) OK, that's it, game over-- 
112.  I N T .   C R S   V A N  -  N I G H T 
CLOSE on a video monitor, Schuyler framed in a FISHEYE SHOT: 
SCHUYLER (FILTER) --you can come out now, assholes-- 
He moves toward the front door, a panicked Christine behind him-- 
RASTA MAN'S VOICE We're blown, let's do it-- 
We hear MEN GETTING TO THEIR FEET, see BODIES MOVE in FG. 
113.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   L I V I N G   R O O M  -  N I G H T 
Christine's furious and terrified, dashes in front of him, LOCKS and THROWS A CHAIN across the front door. 
CHRISTINE You idiot!  Come on! 
She starts to pull him away from the door, he throws off her arm. 
SCHUYLER No, enough already.  I've had it. 
He goes to the window and opens the curtain. 
THROUGH WINDOW-- the Hack/Cabbie, the Rasta/Pilot and a pair of CRS AGENTS (JOHN and PETER from the men's club) hurry toward the house, the older men reach inside their jackets-- 
SCHUYLER Now what. 
CHRISTINE Get away from there!! 
SCHUYLER (steps toward her) Oh, now I suppose they're going to-- 
THE WINDOWS BLOW IN, GUNFIRE, Christine TACKLES HIM and pulls him to the ground as-- 
KNICK-KNACKS fly to pieces directly behind where he was standing. 
CHRISTINE AND SCHUYLER keep low as they dash for the kitchen-- 
SCHUYLER Holy shit!! 
114.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   K I T C H E N  -  N I G H T 
Christine pulls him toward a basement door-- 
115.  I N T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   G A R A G E  -  N I G H T 
They dash down steps to the darkened one-car garage, mostly empty with a few random tools.  MR. KAMINSKY looks up from a game of SOLITAIRE, a day player confused by the sudden commotion. 
SCHUYLER What is this!? 
CHRISTINE God, wake up, it's a con game! 
THE GARAGE DOOR OPENS, Christine pulls Schuyler against a wall-- 
A "PARAMEDIC" charges out of the shadows, pulling a handgun-- 
IN BG MR. KAMINSKY dives for cover with a frightened NOISE-- 
CHRISTINE grabs a WRENCH and CLUBS THE PARAMEDIC, who falls with a CRY, clutching his skull.  They hear FOOTSTEPS on the stairs they just came down.  Christine hustles the dazed Schuyler out of there. 
116.  E X T .   C H R I S T I N E ' S   H O U S E  -  N I G H T

Schuyler drives for all he's worth, Christine watching behind.

A brief CHASE, the van pursues the MBZ.

CHRISTINE (V. O.) He's not some dweeb flunkie, he runs the whole show. 
END SERIES OF SHOTS, DISSOLVE TO: 
128. SCHUYLER'S FACE... LIGHTS through the FRAGMENTED WINDSHIELD cast weird PATTERNS on it.  He's pumping sweat now, reaches for his cell phone, dials, hand shaking.  Christine flicks her cig out the window; she sounds regretful. 
CHRISTINE I'm sorry.  They already did your brother, I guess they figured you for a family of suckers... 
SCHUYLER (on phone) Overseas operator?  Please dial the number for Allgemeine Bank in Zurich... 
CHRISTINE Bet you haven't really been taking care of business the past few days, huh?  This "game," the psych shit about your dad going sui... 
SCHUYLER (on phone) Guten tag-- Vilen dank, Englisch... 
CHRISTINE All of it was just to buy time, keep you from paying attention... 
SCHUYLER (on phone) Blue Two-Five... 6-9-0-D... Yes, I consent to voice-print... My name is Schuyler Van Orton.  I'd like to know my balance, please... that account is closed?! 
CHRISTINE (nervously) I think maybe you should pull over... 
Schuyler sets his jaw, drops the phone-- and turns the wheel hard. 
129.  E X T .   H I G H W A Y  -  N I G H T 
The MBZ SCREECHES for an offramp. 
130.  E X T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler's on his portable phone at a gas station/convenience store, leaning on the Benz as he pumps gas.  Christine stands out of earshot, arms folded, staring at the dark horizon. 
SCHUYLER (on phone) Bob, listen carefully, this is an emergency.  Feingold and his people, I've called all my banks, they've drained the accounts, personal and corporate, everything-- tell the cops I've got one of them with me, we'll make her testify.  They're trying to kill us, I'm heading for the island in Oregon, if I can still find it. Bob-- call when you get this message and-- be extremely careful... 
131.  I N T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T 
START ON-- a thermos full of coffee, foodstuffs, miscellaneous camping supplies as a CLERK holds a credit card, hangs up a phone. He looks up at SCHUYLER and CHRISTINE. 
CLERK They say I gotta confiscate your card... 
Schuyler sighs, "of course," Christine fishes in her pocket. 
CHRISTINE I think I have some cash. 
132.  E X T .   C O N V E N I E N C E   S T O R E  -  N I G H T 
They emerge from the store with a couple of grocery bags, Christine sucks an ice cream pop.  They toss the bags in the trunk. 
CHRISTINE Money isn't everything, right? 
Schuyler is seething, clutching the trunk lid for a beat, then SLAMS it hard when she steps back, making her jump. 
SCHUYLER It might be best if you didn't speak.  I very nearly crushed your skull just now. 
CHRISTINE C'mon chill, what'd they take you for, a couple hundred G's?  Chump change for a guy like you, chalk it up to experience. 
SCHUYLER (quietly, restraining himself) Just under a billion dollars. 
CHRISTINE A bil--? (nervous laugh) You're kidding, right? 
SCHUYLER Do I look like I'm kidding? This is about more than my personal lifestyle-- your pals raided pension plans, charitable foundations, company payrolls... 
CHRISTINE Oh my God-- 
SCHUYLER I don't know what kind of jerk-off con games you've played in the past, but now you're in the big leagues, hon.  You just helped sabotage a small portion of the national economy-- and destroy a whole lotta lives. 
He stares at her, she looks sick and truly scared.  He climbs in the car.  For once without a comeback, she gets in the car quietly.

Schuyler, bleary-eyed, drains coffee from the thermos and tosses it aside.  He glances over at the sleeping Christine, her head tilted toward his shoulder; she looks pretty sexy.  He stares at her for a moment, SIGHS and turns away.

A beautiful Northern lake-- dense forests on the mainland, pines and fall foliage.  A STORM coming in, ominous CLOUDS.  The Benz is parked at the shoreline.  MOVE TO FIND Schuyler and Christine, as they paddle a rowboat toward a small island with a surprisingly humble, somewhat decrepit cabin on it.  A FLASH OF LIGHTNING. 
CUT TO: 
136.  I N T .   O R E G O N   C A B I N  -  D A Y 
CHRISTINE pours a cup of coffee from a metal pot on a wood-burning stove in which a FIRE CRACKLES.  This cabin is genuinely rustic and run-down-- hewn wood, fishing rods, cobwebs, rain damage, dust. WATER DRIPS from the ceiling in a few places.  LIGHTNING FLASHES in BG through the scene, the STORM has gotten pretty bad. 
SCHUYLER finishes taking out his contacts, DROPPING them in cups full of water. He slips on his glasses, then looks at a few framed family photos on the coffee table in front of him.  Christine, barefoot, brings him a cup of coffee, which he sips gratefully. 
SCHUYLER You're not having any? 
CHRISTINE Never drink it.  Makes my tits hurt. 
Schuyler gives her a sidelong glance, looks back at a photo. 
152A(NEW). IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER gobbles handfuls of dry cereal, grabs for anything he can find in the refrigerator. 
153. IN THE SHOWER, Schuyler scrubs away the grime. 
154. IN THE BATHROOM, he inserts a CONTACT LENS. 
154A. IN A DESK DRAWER he finds a few $20.00 bills. 
154B. IN THE BEDROOM-- Schuyler changes into jeans and a sport jacket, tucking the MONEY and the POSTCARD into the pockets.  As he turns to leave, he spots something on his dresser-- 
A WHITE ENVELOPE, with a handwritten "TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN..." 
SCHUYLER frowns at this. tears it open. reacts with fear... 
155. IN THE KITCHEN, SCHUYLER holds the handwritten note to the BLUE FLAME.  He tosses the BURNING PAGE into the sink. 
CLOSE SHOTS on the curling, burning note, we make out KEY WORDS: 
"MY FATHER WAS RIGHT," "NO REASON TO CONTINUE," "TAKE MY OWN LIFE," "I WANT ONLY DEATH..." and finally the signature, "SCHUYLER VAN ORTON..."  This suicide note is no joke. 
SCHUYLER backs away from the sink.  Quiet, determined: 
SCHUYLER No.  Fuck you... I'm going to live... 
156.  I N T .   S T U D Y  -  N I G H T 
Schuyler moves to a bookshelf, looking for a volume, finds-- 
CLOSE-- a large, leather-bound BLACK BOOK with no title. 
SCHUYLER clutches the volume.  HEADLIGHTS shine in the window, a VEHICLE in the drive.  Schuyler moves for a back door. 
157.  E X T .   V A N   O R T O N   H O U S E  -  N I G H T 
A CAR DOOR CLOSES, we see a UNIFORMED FIGURE MOVE O. S., revealing A POLICE STYLE CREST, the words "CALIFORNIA RESIDENTIAL SECURITY," the initials "CRS" in the center. 
SCHUYLER, sneaking around the side of the house, takes this in, waiting for the RENT-A-COPS with FLASHLIGHTS and WEAPONS to enter his house.  Then he hurries away, book under his arm.

UNDER A STREET LAMP on a hilly street, SCHUYLER reaches into his pocket and squints at THE POSTCARD-- 
INSERT POSTCARD, the message side:  "S - IT'S SAFE HERE - D."  An ARROW points to a printed ADDRESS.  Schuyler FLIPS the card over-- a PAINTING of a COLONIAL MANSION down a tree-lined DRIVE...

A NURSE leads Schuyler down a door-lined corridor, no one in sight. This place turns out to be an incredibly ritzy SANITARIUM. 
NURSE The medication seems to be helping. Unfortunately we're going to have to transfer your brother to a public institution in a few days, his funds are entirely exhausted-- unless you're prepared to take responsibility... 
She KNOCKS at a door, OPENS IT a crack and lets Schuyler in. 
160.  I N T .   S A N I T A R I U M   R O O M  -  D A Y 
A pleasant bedroom, and safe-- no sharp objects or primary colors in sight, discreet decorative BARS on the window. 
DAVID, in pajamas, sits in a chair, eating bland food from a plastic lunch tray.  He watches a GOLF MATCH on a tiny WATCHMAN TV, we'll hear it IN BG-- CLAPPING, etc.  He doesn't react as Schuyler enters, moves to his side. 
SCHUYLER David... 
David turns to him, half-smiles; food particles on his lips. 
DAVID Hello Sky... 
Schuyler sits close to David, upset. 
SCHUYLER What are you doing here? 
DAVID Sorry, I was just eating...  I'm much better.  Really. 
David does seem in control now, if a little hazy. 
SCHUYLER Thank God... Listen, I know you put them onto me-- but I understand, we're both victims of this thing... They've stolen everything we ever had, they're trying to drive us both crazy-- but we won't let them. We'll find a way.  There's gotta be a way to beat these bastards!  We're in it together... 
He clutches his brother's hand.  David narrows his eyes, confused. 
DAVID In what together? 
SCHUYLER The game. 
DAVID Oh, Schuyler, there is no game.  It was just a fantasy of mine, a self- aggrandizing delusion... I can't believe you took that shit seriously. 
SCHUYLER (clutching his hand) No, David-- please... 
DAVID (pulling away) Oh, man, stop fucking with me! You know the game doesn't exist... it never did!  It never did... 
Schuyler stares at him for a beat-- no getting through.  David leans forward, turns UP THE TV VOLUME, aiming the set at Schuyler. 
DAVID Can you see? 
SCHUYLER (cold, deadly) Come on, you're not going to put me through all this shit and then kill me on a fucking train, it won't look like a suicide... 
As Schuyler speaks he sits up, the PUNK grabs the bag-- Schuyler grabs the guy's knife hand, they wrestle on the floor of the car, clawing at each other.  The punk drops the knife, it gets knocked beneath the seat, both men reach for it... 
TRANSIT COP Freeze assholes! 
Schuyler and the punk look up to see a TRANSIT COP pointing his WEAPON.  The punk throws his hands up, scrambles to his feet-- 
PUNK Psycho pulled a knife on me! 
The cop has grabbed the still prone Schuyler, flipping him over and slapping a handcuff on him-- 
SCHUYLER What do you think you're doing, this guy attacked me! 
The cop has dropped his guard; the punk spins and bolts into the next car, squeezing through the door.  The TRANSIT COP hastily cuffs Schuyler to an armrest-- 
TRANSIT COP Wait here-- 
He dashes into the next car after the punk.  Schuyler looks at the floor of the car, sees-- 
THE SMALL RADIO and its EARPLUG attached by a WIRE.  The radio has a tiny LOOP/RABBIT EAR antenna on it.  He snatches it up, then YANKS at the cuff.  He spots the knife under the seat, grabs it, starts using the blade to unscrew the armrest from its post. 
FROM THE NEXT CAR he hears SHOUTS, SCREAMS, a serious commotion going on, he doesn't know who's winning.  Schuyler's almost gotten free as the TRAIN SLOWS, when-- 
--the DOOR at the far end of the car opens, it's the PUNK, bruised and bloody, ready to kill. 
He lunges at Schuyler just as he PRIES THE ARMREST off the seat and CLOBBERS him with it.  The punk reels back.  The train has stopped, the doors have opened-- Schuyler grabs his bag and squeezes out onto the platform just before they shut again. 
166.  I N T .   B A R T   S T A T I O N  -  D A Y 
SCHUYLER locks the free cuff on to the same wrist as the other, sliding his jacket over them, moving briskly up the stairs. 
167.  E X T .   B E R K E L E Y   S T R E E T  -  D A Y 
SCHUYLER emerges and walks quickly, checking over his shoulder, BLINKING IN THE BRIGHT MORNING SUN.  He fiddles with the RADIO, the PLUG to his ear.  We hear STATIC, BLEEPING NOISES, FILTERED VOICES. For a few moments the VOICES ON THE RADIO become CLEARER. 
RADIO VOICE #1 --can't let him get away with this, he's outta control!  The next thing you know, he'll push the wrong button and we'll all be dead-- 
SCHUYLER listens intently, leaning against a wall in the shadows, breathing hard.  He stares nervously at a couple of nearby STREET PEOPLE huddled by a shopping cart, they stare back.  Another VOICE on the radio talks OVER the first: 
RADIO VOICE #2 --Whoah whoah whoah-- OK the guy's a moron, sure, but he doesn't have the balls to end the world!  Anyway I'm sicka talking politics, let's get back to the business of nipple piercing-- you got a ring, don't ya Robin? 
We hear the HYSTERICAL GIGGLING of ROBIN QUIVERS.  SCHUYLER blinks, recognizing the voice of RADIO DJ HOWARD STERN. 
RADIO VOICE #2 (HOWARD STERN) Ugh, we gotta do commercials, this is the Howard Stern show... 
SCHUYLER fiddles frantically with the dial and antennas, calling up RANDOM RADIO MUSIC, COMMERCIALS, etc. 
CLOSE ON A TRASH CAN-- Schuyler tosses his hollowed leather book into it.  It falls open, we see the gun is gone. 
CUT TO: 
168(NEW).  I N T .   H O S P I C E  -  D A Y 
TRACK DOWN an institutional corridor, a few EMACIATED PATIENTS in wheelchairs... they only come here to die.  ELIZABETH, Schuyler's ex, 4Oish, fit and attractive, a few months pregnant, READS to a couple of sad PATIENTS in a lounge area.  She trails off as she looks up, astonished to see-- 
SCHUYLER, bruised, frightened, almost looking like he belongs here. 
SCHUYLER Hello Elizabeth... 
168A(NEW).  I N T .   S P O R T S   C A R  -  D A Y 
Elizabeth backs out of a parking lot in a 3OO-ZX CONVERTIBLE and pulls into traffic, Schuyler beside her, babbling emotionally. 
SCHUYLER I'm sorry, I shouldn't be bothering you-- you're a genuinely good person, your work is important, it's real, nothing that happens to me is real anymore-- 
ELIZABETH What has happened to you, Sky? 
SCHUYLER I need your help, you're the only one left, the only one I can trust-- not that I deserve your help, God how could you have even married me, I was a shit to you-- 
ELIZABETH No you weren't-- 
SCHUYLER Yes I was.  Sometimes I think I'm being punished for my sins, I mean, there has to be a reason... 
CUT TO: 
169.  I N T .   B R E A K F A S T   P L A C E  -  D A Y 
ELIZABETH FLIPS THE PAGES of Schuyler's notebook-- page after page of psychotic-looking scribbling, dense UNDERLINES, many EXCLAMATION POINTS.  ON ONE PAGE-- "CRUEL RANDOM SHIT." 
WIDER-- a few BUSINESS PEOPLE read papers, pick at eggs; A LARGE- SCREEN TV plays MORNING PROGRAMS.  Schuyler stares at Elizabeth, awaiting reaction... she seems incapable of speech.  He puts the tiny radio and earplug on the table between them. 
SCHUYLER This is one of their devices, I pulled it off their assassin in the subway.  It's how they communicate with each other. 
Elizabeth picks the thing up, studies it, puts the plug to her ear. 
ELIZABETH It's... a radio... 
Schuyler waves dismissively, "you don't understand," takes the radio back from her and pockets it. 
SCHUYLER I can't find the right channel... Listen, I may not make it through this-- if anything happens, get that notebook to, to, the press, or the FBI or something.  Someone you can trust, I don't know, assuming you can trust anyone.  I just want you to know I'm not crazy, and I didn't kill myself, no matter what they say-- 
She stares at him, trying to be strong, but she's very freaked out. A BARMAID brings their order.  Schuyler stares at the barmaid suspiciously as she puts a cup of coffee before Elizabeth, and gives him a bottle of water and a glass.  He tests the seal. 
SCHUYLER Has this been opened? 
SCHUYLER He's an actor, does TV commercials, I know he's ordered from you, he had food delivered to an office building on Mission-- 
CHINESE WOMAN Many customers, very busy, I don't know, I don't know-- 
SCHUYLER Damn it! 
Schuyler stalks away from her, finds himself facing the wall of signed photographs-- 
ON WALL, old and stained pictures, the most famous being the likes of ED McMAHON and CHARO.  Among them is a newer HEAD SHOT of FEINGOLD with a shit-eating grin... below, the name WILLIAM FISHER. 
SCHUYLER leaps on the counter and tears the photo off the wall-- 
CHINESE WOMAN Stop that, what you doing?! 
Schuyler's already leapt off the counter, bolts out the door. 
175B(NEW).  I N T .   E L I Z A B E T H ' S   C A R  -  D A Y 
SCHUYLER is on the CARPHONE, glances from the road to-- 
THE OBVERSE OF THE HEAD SHOT in his hand, a PHONE NUMBER before the (short) list of credits, he flips it to show Feingold/Fisher. 
SCHUYLER (on phone) Yes, Mrs. Fisher, I know it's short notice but we were hoping your husband could come in for an audition today, he's perfect... 
SCHUYLER looks annoyed at what he's hearing. 
SCHUYLER Isn't there any way we can get in touch with him now...?  I see... 
He makes a quick U-TURN, the tires SCREECHING. 
SCENES 176-179 DELETED 
180.  E X T .   Z O O  -  D A Y 
Late afternoon.  PAN FROM THE ENTRANCE to find SCHUYLER buying a ticket and hurrying in. 
181. IN THE ZOO, Schuyler prowls the crowd with manic energy. 
SCHUYLER'S POV-- ZOO-GOERS gazing at the ANIMALS... CAMERA FINDS Feingold/Fisher, wearing casual clothes, eating a popsicle.  He's doing his best to supervise THREE OBNOXIOUS CHILDREN, two boys and an older girl.  He's just another dad at the zoo, far from impressive-- the Wizard of Oz after the curtain's been pulled. 
When he makes eye contact with Schuyler, he pales, trying to herd the children together as Schuyler moves in on him... he can't get away.  Schuyler grabs the man's shirt. 
SCHUYLER Bill Fisher, hi!  I really admire your work... 
FEINGOLD Oh please... I got my kids here... 
Schuyler releases him, Feingold sheepishly avoids his eyes. Schuyler casually shows him the gun, the man's eyes widen. 
SCHUYLER Get rid of them. 
FEINGOLD (to the kids) Hey, everyone-- here's a twenty! Snack time! 
He dangles the bill over their heads, the KIDS CHEER, leap like dolphins after fish.  The girl's tallest, grabs the cash, they run for a nearby concession.  Schuyler and Feingold stroll together. 
FEINGOLD Look, buddy, it was just a job-- nothing personal, y'know?  I play my part, improvise a little, that's what I'm good at, I still do a little stand-up-- 
SCHUYLER I've seen your resume.  I'm sick of foot soldiers, I've gotta get to whoever's in charge. 
FEINGOLD Of CRS?  Christ, nobody knows, nobody gets the big picture-- (looking away) Jason, Tommy, cut it out! 
FEINGOLD'S BOYS ARE THROWING ROCKS at the monkeys.  They give their father a look and saunter along. 
SCHUYLER's not interested in the zoo drama. 
FEINGOLD Goddammit, why do they do that. 
SCHUYLER How do I find them!?  Their offices were abandoned-- 
FEINGOLD They own the whole building, they just move from floor to floor. 
Schuyler takes this in for a moment, thinking. 
SCHUYLER OK... They know you, you've worked for them.  You're going to get me inside. 
FEINGOLD (shaking his head) Uh-uh, I'm sorry and all, but-- 
SCHUYLER Tell them anything, tell them the cops are after you, you've gotta talk to someone or you'll blow the whistle. 
FEINGOLD No way, it's too dangerous. 
Schuyler cocks his head, steps in front of him.  Right in his face: 
SCHUYLER You don't seem to understand.  Right here, right now-- I'm the danger. 
Feingold gets the message. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
182.  E X T .   C R S   B U I L D I N G  -  N I G H T 
LIGHTS OFF in the building.  A battered STATION WAGON rounds a corner, PAUSES before the ramp to the garage entrance-- the same garage he and Christine were once tormented in. 
183.  I N T .   S T A T I O N   W A G O N  -  N I G H T 
FEINGOLD drives, looking very tense; a kiddie seat strapped next to him, junk galore; he's apparently alone. 
Even though she's keeping a surface cool, he notices the GLASS and SILVERWARE on her tray RATTLING.  She starts to move toward a table, he blocks her path. 
SCHUYLER You're not going anywhere. Feingold, or or Fisher, was that just a game too? 
CHRISTINE What are you talking about? 
SCHUYLER I watched him die... 
Schuyler shows her his BLOOD-STAINED HAND.  Christine looks utterly perplexed, then shrugs, finding a place to put down her tray. 
SCHUYLER Seemed like a nice guy, actually, father of three-- 
CHRISTINE Well, look, I'm sure it's just another stunt-- that can't be real, taste it. 
SCHUYLER You taste it, you fucking vampire. 
He pushes his palm in her face, she flinches, swipes him away, then puts a finger to her ear as-- 
THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and the guard and security man from downstairs burst into the commissary. 
Suddenly the ROOM QUIETS, many others are touching their ears. 
They all TURN in the direction of Schuyler and Christine.  The gate guard gestures at Schuyler, attempting a smile. 
GATE GUARD Could you come with us, please? You're not authorized to be here. 
Schuyler grabs Christine, wraps an arm around her throat, puts his GUN to her neck. 
SCHUYLER Back off.  Everybody back off. 
He uses his knee in the small of her back to push her brutally toward the nearest door, she CHOKES and GASPS. 
188.  I N T .   S T A I R W E L L  -  N I G H T 
The door shuts behind them, the stairs only lead UP. 
SCHUYLER Shit, how do we get out-- 
Christine STOMPS his foot and ELBOWS his gut, breaks free and bolts up the stairs.  Schuyler catches his breath and pursues.  Beneath him, the stairwell door opens, GUARDS PURSUE. 
189.  E X T .   C R S   R O O F  -  N I G H T 
A HIGH LEDGE surrounds the roof on all four sides, a ROOF ENTRANCE at each side as well.  The NUMBER "636" is painted large for helicopters; there are air conditioning vents, ducts, etc.  A MUFFLED ALARM sounds as Christine bursts through the door, followed by Schuyler.  She spins, her back to the EDGE of the atrium, a black pit in the center of the roof with a sunken GLASS SKYLIGHT, a white RAILING around it. 
Schuyler SLAMS the door, a large number 1 painted on it in BLUE. He throws the HEAVY BOLT.  He and Christine circle each other warily, his gun trained on her.  POUNDING from the other side, MUFFLED VOICES that can't be heard. 
For the first time, Christine focuses on the gun in his hand, then clutches the railing. 
CHRISTINE Wait a minute.  What's that? 
Schuyler addresses her as if speaking to a child: 
SCHUYLER It's my gun... 
CHRISTINE We didn't give it to you?  Where did it come from? 
SCHUYLER A gun store. 
CHRISTINE We searched your house! 
SCHUYLER Guess you fucked up again. 
Christine touches her ear, listening to something, then puts her hand to her mouth, speaks urgently. 
CHRISTINE He's armed, he's got a real gun. Real Situation, real-- 
Schuyler steps forward and violently wrenches the EAR PIECE and HAND MIKE away from Christine, the wire tears her blouse open. 
SCHUYLER Yeah, it's real all right. 
CHRISTINE Schuyler this is all fake, tricks, it's all part of the game-- 
SCHUYLER Stop it.  Every word out of your mouth is a lie-- 
Christine's desperately panicked, fumbling for words. 
CHRISTINE The key!!  They, we gave you a key to the elevator!  Why would we do that?!  We wanted you to come up-- 
SCHUYLER Of course you did.  So you could kill me or, or frame me for murder-- 
CHRISTINE No, no, it's THE GAME!!  Blanks, squibs, high-tech special effects, none of it's real!  Just open that door and I'll show you! 
Schuyler hesitates a moment, looking in the direction of the door. 
SCHUYLER I open the door and I die. 
ON THE DOOR-- POUNDING DESPERATE, but the ALARM DROWNS out the sounds of VOICES on the other side. 
SCHUYLER turns quickly as she takes a step towards him.  He points the gun at her again.  He looks ready to use it.  The following DIALOG overlaps and collides, growing AURAL CHAOS-- 
SCHUYLER You move again I swear I'll kill you, you bitch. 
CHRISTINE THINK ABOUT IT!!  They followed you every step of the way, the cab, in the trunk, we had a diver-- 
SCHUYLER They?  We? 
SHIFT TO SLOW MOTION: 
SCHUYLER moves for the edge of the atrium pit... 
THE OTHERS react in HORROR, SHOUT "NO!!", lunging TOWARD HIM... 
DAVID'S HEAD suddenly MOVES, he BLINKS... 
SCHUYLER leaps onto the safety barrier around the atrium pit. 
CHRISTINE jumps to her feet, perfectly alert, a hand extended, SCREAMING, just as-- 
SCHUYLER CATAPULTS HIMSELF INTO SPACE, and-- 
DAVID SITS BOLT UPRIGHT. 
DAVID SKY, NOOOO!! 
SCHUYLER sees this, too late-- 
HE AND DAVID make terrified, helpless eye contact across the void, arms outstretched.  Schuyler has time to register his irrevocable error as he seems to hang suspended above the glass skylight for an agonizing MOMENT. 
THEN HE FALLS...  LEAVE SLOW MOTION. 
190.  I N T .   A T R I U M  -  N I G H T 
SCHUYLER CRASHES through the skylight, TUMBLING-- SPARKLING SHARDS surround him like stars as he PLUNGES, SPINS, SCREAMING. 
191. RAPID CUTS-- the CLOWN, CHRISTINE's face, SCHUYLER and DAVID as CHILDREN, HIS FATHER's head striking the landing.  These FLASH PAST so rapidly we can't quite process them. 
192. INTERCUT WITH:  INCREASING DARKNESS, GROUND RUSHING CLOSER... 
ON SCHUYLER'S FACE as he experiences the epiphany that comes before the end.  BRILLIANT ANGELIC LIGHT suddenly illuminates him, his eyes roll into his head, closing-- 
ANGLE FROM ABOVE-- the LIGHTS are real, they've COME ON to show-- 
SCHUYLER'S IMPACT-- he LANDS on his back, arms outstretched, eyes squeezed shut-- 
--and is swallowed by an ENORMOUS INFLATED LIFESAVING CUSHION that covers the floor of the atrium. 
SCHUYLER BOUNCES in the cushion a few times, gradually coming to a rest, harmless bits of BREAKAWAY GLASS showering down around him. 
He doesn't move a muscle, his eyes still closed. 
CLOSER ON HIS FACE... muscles twitch.  His eyes open. 
HIS POV-- UP the now illuminated tunnel formed by the walls of the building around the atrium.  THE FULL MOON in the very center through the hole in the glass. 
All the lighted GLASS ELEVATORS COME TO EARTH, packed with people. 
SCHUYLER stares upward, mouth open, motionless. 
DAVID comes running from an elevator, leaps up onto the cushion and bounces over to Schuyler, a huge smile on his face. 
DAVID Hey, bro, how you doin'? 
Getting no response, David hops closer, squats by Schuyler's side. 
DAVID Admit it, you weren't bored... 
SCHUYLER remains motionless, David's worried now, grabs his arm and starts shaking him. 
DAVID Jesus.  Sky, c'mon Sky-- 
SCHUYLER begins to LAUGH, a tremendous catharsis.  DAVID laughs too, greatly relieved as he helps Schuyler to his feet. 
THE TWO BROTHERS clutch each other for support on the BOUNCING surface, LAUGHING.  CRS EMPLOYEES have gathered around the cushion, CHEERING and APPLAUDING. 
SCHUYLER wipes his eyes, shaking his head with amazement.  Then he hauls back and SLUGS DAVID in the jaw, sending him flying onto his back on the cushion.  MORE CHEERS from the crowd, as if they were watching a boxing match. 
CUT TO: 
193.  I N T .   C R S   L O B B Y  -  N I G H T 
THE HALLELUJAH CHORUS from Handel's "Messiah" plays.  SCHUYLER and DAVID enter together from the atrium, the CUSHION deflates behind them.  David licks blood from his lips, rubs his jaw. 
DAVID You've been wanting to do that for a long, long time, haven't you? 
Schuyler half-smiles.  The SECURITY MAN unlocks Schuyler's handcuffs, giving him back his gun, which Schuyler stares at. 
DAVID Like they'd really leave a loaded gun lying around.  They went over the whole place with a metal detector, then packed that thing with blanks. 
They turn a corner into the main lobby, Schuyler absently pockets the gun, looks up in wonder... 
SCHUYLER'S POV-- a SURPRISE PARTY:  A STEREO, STREAMERS and BALLOONS, a CHAMPAGNE FOUNTAIN, CAKE and FOOD.  CRS EMPLOYEES (mostly ordinary-looking office workers) CLAP and CHEER for Schuyler.  They wear PARTY HATS, blow PLASTIC HORNS. 
SMILING PEOPLE eager to offer CONGRATULATIONS surround him.  He's pretty shaky, like a newborn calf.  JOHN and PETE shake his hand. 
JOHN Good one, buddy, really had you going, didn't we? 
PETE Wait'll you try level two... (a wink) Joke. 
The RASTA SLAPS his back, Schuyler instinctively looks over his shoulder for a gag message. 
RASTA That look on your face up there? Shit, man, I almost lost it.

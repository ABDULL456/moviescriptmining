MARIAN I'm sorry, I'm a little nervous.  It's my first time in New York.  Just a minute. 
Marian fumbles with a piece of paper she's rooted out of her purse. 
Mischa, annoyed, slams the shift lever into Drive and lurches off. 
Marian leans forward into the rectangular opening of the Plexiglas partition. 
MARIAN I want to go to 526 East 5TH.  That's in the East Village.  My daughter said it would cost thirty dollars. 
In the REAR-VIEW MIRROR we glimpse Mischa giving Marian a sly look. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LOCATION - DAY 
The TAXI passes on a turnpike, streaming with vehicles, headed toward Manhattan.  DRIVE-BY TRANSITION. 
INT. TAXI - DAY 
Hurtling along.  Marian cranes her head through the partition and attempts to strike up a conversation with the surly cabbie. 
MARIAN I came to New York to visit my youngest daughter. 
MISCHA And where is she? 
looking out the window, her face clouded with consternation. 
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY 
Cars pouring into Manhattan over one of the many bridges spanning the East River. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. EAST 5TH STREET AND 2ND AVENUE - DAY 
The cab brakes to a halt, bringing Marian INTO THE FRAME, her face strickened with fear. 
Marian climbs out of the cab as Mischa, in the background, opens the trunk to retrieve her bag.  Marian, taking in the foreign surroundings, seems confused about something. 
MARIAN Pardon me, Mischa.  Is this 526 East 5TH Street? 
Mischa closes the trunk and approaches Marian with her one piece of luggage on a tote. 
MISCHA No, no.  Sorry, I can't drive you to door.  There's a roadblock on Avenue B (he gestures down the street) right there ... 
MARIAN'S AND MISCHA'S P.O.V. - 
At the far end of the block, we SEE a movable, blue NYPD roadblock. 
BACK - 
Mischa climbs back into his cab and peels off. 
NEW ANGLE - 
HIGH DOWN WIDE of Marian standing forlornly at the end of the street, a Dayton's shopping bag in one hand, her luggage strapped to the tote in the other. 
TITLE IS SUPERIMPOSED: 
MY MOTHER DREAMS THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES IN NEW YORK 
CUT TO: 
EXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
Marian pulling her luggage apprehensively down the street. 
She passes THE SQUATTERS, a motley group of homeless teenagers, pierced, tattooed, wild hairdos and even wilder attire. 
SQUATTER #1 Hey, lady, can you help us out with some change today? 
Marian, shocked by their circumstances, rolls her luggage past them, smiling faintly. 
SQUATTER #2 Come on.  Every little bit helps.  A little food, you know? 
MARIAN Maybe some other time. 
ACROSS THE STREET - 
The BIKERS, wearing their club's colors embroidered on blue jeans, and leather, vests, back their motorcycles in a uniform row against the curb, kill their engines, park them at an angle on their kickstands, and dismount. 
They high-five a biker known as the DISCIPLE PROSPECT, a small, mean-looking man with a red bandana tied taut over his head, and then disappear into the windowless clubhouse, passing through a large, forbidding, black door with the skeleton of Death riding a motorcycle painted on it. 
The Disciple Prospect tosses the butt of a cigarette into a rusted steel drum and flames erupt. 
MARIAN - 
in horror, cannot pry her eyes away from them. 
NEW ANGLE - 
An upstairs window on a six-story, red-brick co-op building. PAULA, Marian's daughter, a pretty woman with short dark hair, is leaning out the window, waving. 
PAULA Mom!  Hi!  I'll be right down. 
EXT. THE FRONT SECURITY DOOR - A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
Paula emerges to greet her mother. 
Marian glances one last time across the street and exchanges oblique looks with the Disciple Prospect, now parked on a stool next to the burning drum.  He seems to home in on her. 
INT. CO-OP - TWILIGHT - A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
Marian removes her glasses and fixes her gaze on her daughter. 
MARIAN I wanted to ask you something.  Those motorcycles across the street ...? 
PAULA Uh-huh? 
MARIAN ... What are they all doing there? 
PAULA That's the Satan's Disciples' New York headquarters. 
MARIAN (alarmed) The motorcycle gang?  Don't they deal drugs and rape young girls? 
PAULA I've never had any problem with them. People say it's the safest block in the East Village. (lays a reassuring hand on her mother's arm) I just hope their motorcycles don't keep you up at night. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CO-OP - NIGHT 
CRANE UP to Marian lying wide awake on a convertible sofa next to the street window.  We (Marian!) hear VOICES, MOTORCYCLES REVVING, POLICE SIRENS, followed by what sounds like GUNFIRE, tires SCREECHING, a cacophony of sounds typical of summer nights in the East Village. 
We go UP and OVER Marian toward the window as imaginary voices flood in and become intelligible. 
RANDOM VOICES (O.S.) Did that shipment of heroin come in? That old lady see them? We can kill her if we have to. 
RAUCOUS LAUGHTER erupts. 
EXT. CO-OP BUILDING - DAY 
ESTABLISHING SHOT of Paula's red-brick co-op, splashed with sunlight and framed by a bright blue sky. 
INT. CO-OP - DAY 
It's quiet in the co-op.  Marian is dusting the bookshelves and humming to herself. 
Behind a shelf of books she discovers a PHOTO ENVELOPE with some snapshots in them.  Curious, she has a look-see. 
SNAPSHOTS - 
flipping through Marian's hands.  They chronicle Paula and a BOYFRIEND on a recent vacation to a Caribbean island.  Marian is amused by them ... until she comes to one showing Paula with her bathing suit top off, arms raised giddily in the air. 
MARIAN - 
gasps, then blushes and quickly replaces the pictures. 
INT. CO-OP - DAY - LATER 
Marian is at the window, peering through the furling curtains. 
EXT. STREET - DAY - MARIAN'S P.O.V. - 
Looking down on the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse.  Two BIKERS and their GIRLFRIENDS swagger out of the clubhouse, don their helmets, mount their bikes, kick-start them to life and roar off down the street. 
EXT. NEW YORK - DUSK 
Manhattan skyscrapers framed against a twilit sky. 
INT. RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT 
Marian and Paula are sitting at the bar.  They each have a glass of white wine in front of them.  Paula is looking at some PHOTOS of the farm that Marian has brought along. 
MARIAN Would you look at those strawberries. They made the best jam. (passes Paula the photos) Here are some more pictures of the farm. Crops were unbelievable this year. 
Paula continues to browse through the snaps. 
MARIAN Plenty of rain.  Your dad would have been happy with that. 
Marian removes a pill from a small vial she's rummaged out of her purse and slips it discreetly into her mouth. 
MARIAN I just can't seem to focus on anything these days. 
PAULA (turning to her mother) That's why it's good you came to visit me. 
MARIAN (washing her pill down with some wine) How are you doing sweetheart? 
PAULA I'm good. 
MARIAN Dating anyone? 
Marian, not wanting to be a disappointment to her daughter, damn her fears, gathers her purse up and starts out the door. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Marian is again prevented from an easy exit when a young, hip looking COUPLE come bounding down the stairs.  As she stands at her open door to let them pass, they completely ignore her as if she didn't exist. 
EXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY - A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
Seen from Marian's perspective across the street, the front of the Satan's Disciples headquarters is quiet.  There are only a couple Harleys parked out front. 
Marian, relieved that there are no bikers out, hurries off in the direction of First Avenue, determined to see the sights of the city. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY - MONTAGE 
A giddy, almost dreamlike, MONTAGE of Marian touring New York.  She's SUPERIMPOSED over famous landmarks, as if she were standing stationery and the city were in a diorama rotating all around her.  The Empire State Building; Circle Cruise Line; eating a hot dog from a street vendor; shopping at Macy's.  Marian beams as she is magically whisked along, walking on air. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY 
Marian comes INTO THE FRAME around the corner.  She has a spring in her step and a broad smile emblazoning her face. But her sanguine mood is quickly shattered when she HEARS shouting.  She freezes in her tracks. 
ACROSS THE STREET - THE SATAN'S DISCIPLES HEADQUARTERS - 
WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hello. 
DISCIPLE PROSPECT Washing machine repairman. 
The DOOR BUZZES almost at once, and the Disciple Prospect pushes it in and holds it open until Marian is safely inside. He looks at her a little annoyed.  Marian is absolutely nonplussed. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CO-OP HALLWAY - LATER THAT DAY 
Paula comes running up the stairs.  She stops when she SEES: 
MARIAN - 
sitting on the floor, propped against the door to their unit. 
Paula shakes her head reprovingly at her mother who just shrugs, chagrined. 
INT. CO-OP - BATHROOM - NIGHT - LATER 
Paula is in the bathroom.  She has her mother's vial of Valium in her hand. 
PAULA Maybe you should lay low tomorrow.  I'm going to see if I can get off early and maybe we can take the ferry cruise. Okay? 
LIVING ROOM - 
Looking through the security eyepiece, a FISH-EYE LENS SHOT of an attractive, but distraught woman in her twenties, puffing a cigarette, eyes red and swollen from crying. 
MARIAN Who is it? 
MARIKA It's Marika.  Is Paula there? 
MARIAN She's at work.  I'm her mother. 
MARIKA Oh.  I thought today was Saturday. 
Marian, seemingly reassured, opens the door for her.  She sees Marika, realizes she's upset about something, and feels immediately compassionate toward her. 
MARIKA I'm sorry.  I had a wretched night. 
MARIAN Oh.  You need a cappuccino. 
And she lets Marika in. 
INT. CO-OP - DAY - A FEW MINUTES LATER 
They're sitting at the dining table, having coffee.  Marian is listening sympathetically to Marika's tale of woe. 
MARIKA And there was this number on my phone bill that I didn't recognize.  Calls made at three and four in the morning.  So, I called the number ... and a woman answered.  And I ... I hung up. (leans forward) So, then I followed him.  Just like in the movies.  And I found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in Brooklyn.  We had been going together for almost a year. 
MARIAN (shaking her head in disgust) Men ... they're all the same. (beat) Our pastor in Sioux Falls was caught with his wife's sister. 
The Disciples dismounting from their bikes below, shutting down their engines and removing their helmets. 
INT. CO-OP - DAY 
At the window, Marian and Marika standing side by side. 
MARIAN I wonder what they do in there?  Don't they frighten you?  They all look so ... 
MARIKA ... Manly? 
Marian does a double-take and throws a backward glance at Marika. 
MARIKA You know, probably none of them had a mother like you. 
Marian and Marika smile at each other. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. EAST 5TH STREET - DAY 
Marian's FOOT STEPS OFF THE CURB. 
WIDER ANGLE - 
Marian crosses the street headed in the direction of the Satan's Disciples headquarters. 
The black, forbidding door leading into the clubhouse with its painting of Death on a stylized Harley, gripping lightning bolts for handlebars. 
DISCIPLE PROSPECT - 
looking at Marian looking up at the door. 
DISCIPLE PROSPECT Is there something else I can do for you? 
MARIAN Well, I'd love to see inside your club. 
DISCIPLE PROSPECT (taken aback) You want to come inside? 
MARIAN Well, if you're not holding a meeting or anything. 
EXT. CLUBHOUSE ENTRANCE - DAY - A FEW MOMENTS LATER 
The Disciple Prospect emerges from the club with the HEAD DISCIPLE, a gentle giant of a man with a long, flowing wispy beard and an old man's paunch.  They're muttering about something. 
DISCIPLE PROSPECT Her daughter lives across the street and she was wondering ... 
HEAD DISCIPLE What? 
DISCIPLE PROSPECT She's curious ... 
The Head Disciple glances over at Marian standing curbside, expectantly awaiting approval.  He sees that she's ingenuous. 
Marian blushes at their warm response to her unexpected appearance. 
HEAD DISCIPLE (explaining her visit) Marian's daughter lives across the street and she was a little worried about her. 
DISCIPLE #1 Swear to God, lady, she's not here. 
Laughter erupts.  Marian smiles. 
DISCIPLE #2 Hey, is she cute? 
DISCIPLE #3 Does she like motorcycles? 
DISCIPLE #4 Can she cook? 
Amiable laughter fills the room.  Marian laughs with them. She glances all around her, fascinated by this dungeon she had dreamed and fantasized about since she first arrived in New York. 
MARIAN You know, this isn't so bad.  It looks like our kids' rooms when they were growing up. 
INSERT SHOTS - 
of overflowing ashtrays, crushed beer cans, fast food wrappers balled up and strewn on tables. 
BACK - 
to Marian, her brow knitted thoughtfully in a schoolmarmish expression. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. CLUBHOUSE - DAY - STILL LATER 
All the Disciples are huddled around Marian in the middle of the clubhouse, as if she were the mother hen, arms folded across their chests, smiles creasing their faces, sated. 
MARIAN Well, I'd better be going.  It was nice meeting all of you. 
DISCIPLE #1 Thanks, Marian. 
CHORUS OF OTHER DISCIPLES Thanks, Marian. 
DISCIPLE #2 The food was outstanding. 
Marian starts off. 
HEAD DISCIPLE You know, if we can do anything for you, Marian, you just let us know. 
MARIAN (turns, considers for a moment) Well, there is one thing. (beat, mildly scolding) At night, your motorcycles are so darn loud, I'm not getting much sleep.  Now, I'm going home in a few days, so ... could I ask you to keep them quiet? 
Some of the Disciples exchange petulant looks, rolling their eyes at the request. 
HEAD DISCIPLE (mollifying) Well, we'll, uh, see what we can do, Marian. 
All the Disciples break into laughter. 
MARIAN (blurting out) I met the Satan's Disciples today. 
MR. PALMER (chuckling nervously) Really? 
PAULA Mother, I ... 
MARIAN (waving her daughter off) My daughter lives right across the street from the Satan's Disciples' clubhouse, and I was so worried about her ... so, I went over and introduced myself. And they were the nicest people. 
Paula and Mr. Palmer exchange disquieting glances. 
MR. PALMER (playing along) Well, that's a very unusual New York experience. 
MARIAN I had a wonderful time. 
Paula is in a mild state of shock hearing her mother's fantastical anecdote. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CO-OP - NIGHT 
Paula is sitting at the dining table with a plate piled with roast chicken, potatoes, and broccoli in front of her.  She has a worried look etched on her face. 
Marian is in the kitchen in the background, feeling light and happy, a singsong quality to her voice.  She brings a plate of food for herself to the table. 
MARIAN And they were so friendly those young men.  Though I do think they should shave their beards and ... and get some nicer clothes. 
PAULA (CONT'D) It's okay.  Dad's dying put a lot of stress on you.  But you're going to be all right.  We're all going to be all right.  Where did you get this vivid imagination, huh? 
Paula grips Marian's arm a little tighter and shakes it gently as if snapping her back to reality.  Marian returns her a tight-lipped smile. 
FADE OUT. 
INT. CO-OP - NIGHT 
Marian, lying supine on the convertible sofa bed by the open window, snoring peacefully. 
EXT. EAST 5TH STREET - NIGHT 
On the sidewalk, the Disciple Prospect sits next to the fire breathing oil drum, standing sentry over the Harleys. 
One of the Disciples comes out of the clubhouse and they high five.  The Disciple mounts his Harley and is about to kick start it to life, when the Disciple Prospect rises from his stool. 
DISCIPLE PROSPECT Yo, man! 
The Disciple about to start his bike, turns. 
The Disciple Prospect raises two fingers to his lips in a kind of warning, then gestures up to Paula's co-op where Marian is sleeping. 
The Disciple, remembering the new rule, nods assent with a slightly annoyed expression. 
Then, he puts his Harley into neutral, dismounts, and starts slowly walking it down the quiet, ill-lit street. 
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY 
A lovely, sun-drenched day.  Shadows dapple a promenade along one of the park's many ponds.  Paula and Marian walk arm-in arm. 
PAULA I think you should consider coming out and staying with me longer. 
MARIAN Oh, I don't want to be in the way. You've got your career and everything. 
PAULA You wouldn't be in the way.  I like having you around. 
MARIAN Dear, I was thinking.  Why don't we go to Paris next year?  I've never been.  Your father, God bless him, wasn't much for traveling. 
PAULA I'd love to. 
They walk off into the golden light. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CO-OP - DAY 
Marian is finishing up her packing.  Paula comes from the kitchen, bearing a gift for her mother to take home with her. 
PAULA Here you go. (Marian accepts the gift) I think you should talk to Dr. Byrne when you get back about how much Valium he's prescribing.  Okay? 
MARIAN At my age, I'm going to take any pill that makes me feel better.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT 
Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming 10:19pm 28/07/47 
The air is filled with the sounds of a warm, summer night. A light comes on in a FARMHOUSE window. The door opens, a small dog and a young girl emerge. 
GIRL Go on now Paul, don't be long. 
The dog trots out across the property. It stops to scratch. The sounds of night cease. The dog stops scratching, sniffing the air, cocking its head, sensing something. We hear a low humming sounds. The dog looks up. We see a soft orange glow reflected in its eyes. The dog whimpers Back at the farmhouse, a deep, dull thud shakes the ground, bringing the small girl back out onto the veranda. An orange glow pulsates somewhere out in the darkness. 
GIRL Paul... Paul? The girl draws near, illuminated by the orange glow. 
GIRL Paul?! The glow fades again. MUSIC: "The Boy In The Bubble" by Paul Simon. 
TITLE: PAUL 
EXT. SAN DIEGO STREET. PRESENT - DAY 
GRAHAM WILLY (32) and CLIVE GOLLINGS (33) stand in the blazing San Diego sunshine, waiting to cross the road. GRAHAM is thin but his clothes seem too small. He has long greasy hair, buck teeth and thick glasses. CLIVE is bigger and wears a long black leather coat, Red Dwarf T-shirt and boots. His hair is densely curly and shaped like a pyramid. Four people dressed as BORG from Star Trek pass by. GRAHAM and CLIVE shrug derisively. The cross-walk beeps. As the music kicks in, GRAHAM and CLIVE set off across the road towards the San Diego Convention Centre. They make their way through a throng of costumed Comic-Con attendees. 
INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. CONVENTION FLOOR - LATER 
GRAHAM and CLIVE are at a fantasy weapons stand. CLIVE is brandishing a KATANA SWORD. He test the balance, the weight, the sharpness. He closes one eye and looks down the length of the blade. He nods appreciatively. 
CLIVE Beautiful piece. 
VENDER Damn straight. Practical performance. 100% Japanese, folded steel. Real hero shit. 
CLIVE How much? 
VENDER 
CLIVE nods, puts the sword down and walks away. 
GRAHAM Aren't you gonna get it? 
CLIVE No, it's rubbish. 
INT. CONVENTION CENTRE. SIGNING PAVILLION - DAY 
We see them on an escalator, walking down a wide corridor, passing people in a variety of costumes. Finally, they join a line of people waiting to meet the actor, MICHAEL BIEHN. 
GRAHAM What are you going to ask? 
CLIVE Do you feel that the killing of Hicks and Newt in Alien 3, invalidates Ripley's struggle at the closed of the previous installment? 
GRAHAM I was going to ask that! 
CLIVE 
(IN KLINGON) Tough tits four eyes. 
SECURITY Alright, next! Suddenly nervous, GRAHAM approaches. MICHAEL BIEHN is signing pictures. He is pleasant, if business like. 
MICHAEL BIEHN Hey there. Who's it to? 
GRAHAM Graham. 
MICHAEL BIEHN Graham. 
GRAHAM Uh... are you... did you? 
MICHAEL BIEHN There you go. SECURITY moves GRAHAM on. CLIVE approaches. 
MICHAEL BIEHN Hey there. Who's it to? 
CLIVE Clive. 
MICHAEL BIEHN Clive. 
CLIVE Uh... are you... did you? 
MICHAEL BIEHN There you go. SECURITY moves CLIVE on. CLIVE scrambles for his camera. 
CLIVE I... I need to photograph him. 
SECURITY You can take it from there. CLIVE and GRAHAM huddle together and try to position themselves with MICHAEL BIEHN in the background. CLIVE takes the shot. We see a frozen image of CLIVE and GRAHAM, with MICHAEL BIEHN barely visible in the background. The pair move off, looking at their spoils. 
GRAHAM The Groom Lake Military Test Facility. 
CLIVE MacArthur's Black Mile. 
GRAHAM Is that a real one? 
CLIVE No, I made it up myself. 
GRAHAM I like it. 
CLIVE Be great if we saw something. 
GRAHAM Yes, imagine if we got buzzed up by a craft. 
CLIVE That would be incredible. It just sort of stops in the air and hovers then just goes up really fast. Whoosh. 
GRAHAM What would you do if they actually landed? 
CLIVE Keep it together. First contact is a big responsibility. They come in peace, we go to pieces? That's not how I roll. CLIVE looks at GRAHAM who is staring off, wide eyed. 
CLIVE What's wrong? GRAHAM points off into the distance. HEADLIGHTS. 
GRAHAM It's them. They found us. I don't know how but they found us. 
CLIVE Who? Who's found us? 
GRAHAM The Libyans! 
CLIVE Run for it Marty! GRAHAM and CLIVE scramble for the RV. 
INT. RV - NIGHT 
CLIVE drives, GRAHAM looks nervous. In the dashboard of the RV is a rear view monitor. They look at it intently. 
GRAHAM Perhaps it's not them. Perhaps whoever it was turned doff. 
CLIVE Of course it's them. We're dead. It's like Deliverance. They're going to rape us and break our arms. 
GRAHAM I don't want my arms broken! 
CLIVE There's only one thing for it. 
GRAHAM What? 
CLIVE I'm gonna have to fly blind. 
CLIVE kills the headlights. They are plunged into darkness, still travelling at 65mph. The headlights come back on. 
CLIVE Probably best not to do that. I couldn't really see anything. They stare at the monitor. Suddenly, creeping up the rear of the RV, headlights. The front of a car becomes visible. 
CLIVE Oh God, oh God, oh God. 
GRAHAM I need the toilet. 
CLIVE Me too. The vehicle behind pulls out to overtake. 
CLIVE They're trying to overtake. 
GRAHAM Don't let them get past. 
CLIVE Should I ram them? 
GRAHAM What about the deposit? CLIVE gingerly jerks the wheel, causing the RV to swerve. A BLACK SEDAN car appears next to them, manoeuvering wildly to avoid the RV. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare in horror, their eyes widen as the car flips over and tumbles several times, bouncing across the asphalt and sliding to a smoking stop on its roof. GRAHAM's mouth hangs open. CLIVE blinks. 
CLIVE It wasn't them. The RV pulls up to the crashed vehicle and stops. GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out of the window. 
CLIVE We should see if they're okay. 
GRAHAM I still need a wee. 
CLIVE I can hold mine. GRAHAM goes to the back of the RV and into the toilet. CLIVE remains int he driving seat, staring out at the mangled Sedan. The toilet flushes and GRAHAM reappears. 
GRAHAM The bulb's gone in there. 
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
GRAHAM and CLIVE step out of the RV and approach the car. Inside are three unconscious men. One door is open. 
CLIVE Hello? They wait for a few seconds. Nothing. 
GRAHAM Maybe you should call for help. GRAHAM pulls out a cell phone and starts to dial. 
VOICE (O.S.) I wouldn't do that if I were you. GRAHAM and CLIVE spin round to see an indistinct figure sitting on a rock in the nearby darkness. The glow of a cigarette briefly lights up what appear to be two large, black eyes. GRAHAM and CLIVE gawp. 
INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT 
GRAHAM drives, agitated. He looks behind him a couple of times. PAUL is hunting around in the fridge. 
PAUL Can I have this ham? 
GRAHAM Uh... yes. 
PAUL Great! PAUL starts to dangle strips of sandwich ham into his mouth, wolfing it down hungrily. 
GRAHAM Paul? Where am I going again? 
PAUL I told you, North. Do you have a map? GRAHAM pulls the map. It obscures the wind shield. 
PAUL Not when we're driving, Graham. 
The map disappears back up into the roller. 
GRAHAM Sorry. 
PAUL Just head North. We need to get as much distance as we can between us and them. 
GRAHAM Them? Who's them? 
EXT. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
We hear the noise of engines, then boots on concrete as a dozen soldiers rush the area, attending the crash. A suited man gets out of a Sedan car. We don't see his face at first. The shot remains at his hip. He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a Twinkie. He unwraps it and brings it up to his mouth. We follow and see his face for the first time. Chiselled, focused, confident. This is SPECIAL AGENT ZOIL. A SOLDIER approaches. 
CAPTAIN Sir? 
ZOIL Talk to me. 
CAPTAIN Three survivors, company men, hurt but alive. 
ZOIL Anyone else? 
CAPTAIN No sir. ZOIL looks into the sky and breathes in the night air. 
CAPTAIN What's this? The CAPTAIN motions to a patch of moisture near his feet. ZOIL touches the wet patch and licks his finger. 
CAPTAIN What is it sir? Brake fluid? Gas? 
ZOIL No. It's neither of those things. He looks around, then notices tire tracks in the dust by the side of the road. ZOIL stands, full of purpose. He returns to his car and hits a button on the dash. 
VOICE What's the situation? 
ZOIL We have a guest who's left the hotel without paying, sir. 
VOICE Damn it! Do you think he's "left' left? 
ZOIL Doubtful. NORAD would have picked up a bogie. Those guys can track Santa. No sir, he's still here. Question is, for how long? 
VOICE Don't you think this is all a bit of a coincidence? 
ZOIL How so? 
VOICE I signed the red document this morning, Zoil. Don't you think it's odd that he chooses today to go AWOL? How did he know? 
ZOIL Are you suggesting he has someone on the inside. 
VOICE Maybe. 
ZOIL Well he's definitely got someone on the outside. 
VOICE What? 
ZOIL Tire tracks, sir. Tire tracks... among other things. I'd bet my left nut that little bastard's hitched a ride. 
VOICE Lock down the area. Road blocks, spot checks, the whole nine yards. You're going to handle this personally, Zoil. I want this wrapped up before Letterman. 
EXT/INT. RV. NIGHT - A FEW HOURS LATER 
Close on the wheel. Pull out to reveal the RV. Inside, CLIVE's eyes open. From the bathroom, CLIVE can hear the sound of someone noisily emptying their bladder. He notices his jeans have been pegged up to dry. He leans out to see GRAHAM in the driving seat, then looks back at the bathroom door. The toilet flushes. CLIVE pretends to be asleep as the door opens. A pair of skinny grey legs in cut-off shorts pass the bunk. 
PAUL The bulb's gone in there. CLIVE gets up silently and wraps his black towel around his middle. He creeps toward the front of the RV. GRAHAM drives, PAUL sits in the Chewie seat eating pistachios. 
PAUL I hate it when you get the closed ones, right? 
GRAHAM I usually bite them open. 
PAUL Are you fucking insane? You gotta tap "em and if they don't open you throw them away. 
GRAHAM That's molluscs. 
AGENT 1 Is that right? 
AGENT 2 (O.S.) Hey Haggard?! 
HAGGARD Yeah? O'REILLY appears at the door waving a 10x8" photograph. 
O'REILLY These guys have met Michael Biehn. 
HAGGARD No shit! How was he? 
CLIVE He was a good egg. 
GRAHAM Very unaffected. 
HAGGARD That's nice to hear. 
(TO AGENT 2) O'Reilly? Anything else? 
O'REILLY Just some pissy jeans. HAGGARD looks down at the towel wrapped around CLIVE's waits. CLIVE look embarrassed. 
HAGGARD Okay, you guys can go. 
CLIVE Thank you. May I ask what you're searching for? 
HAGGARD Of course you may. There is a slight pause. GRAHAM and CLIVE board the RV. 
INT/EXT. RV - NIGHT 
GRAHAM and CLIVE pull away in silence. They are both confused and shaken. 
CLIVE Well, it's pretty obvious what happened there, isn't it? 
GRAHAM Is it? 
CLIVE Yes, the government used some sort of neurotoxic paint on the Black Mailbox, which was white by the way, and it caused us to suffer a shared hallucination about an alien. I mean, it's what we've always wanted, isn't it? 
GRAHAM I suppose so. 
CLIVE Than that's what happened. PAUL materializes from thin air behind them. 
PAUL 
WRONG! 
EXT. DESERT ROAD - NIGHT 
The sound of screeching tires draws the attention of the two AGENTS. They see the RV swerve across the road in the distance before righting itself and continuing on its way. 
INT. RV - NIGHT 
CLIVE Where the hell did you go? 
PAUL Nowhere. 
GRAHAM What, you went invisible? 
PAUL It's not invisibility per so. It's more like what a chameleon does with a little light blending thrown in for good measure. 
GRAHAM Like Predator? 
PAUL Exactly. 
GRAHAM Can you do it whenever you want? 
PAUL 
(PREDATOR VOICE) Anytime... 
EXT. ROAD - NIGHT 
We hear GRAHAM squeal with delight. The RV guns up the road into the night. 
INT. RV - DAYBREAK 
CLIVE drives in silence. PAUL sits in the passenger seat eating nuts. Day is breaking over the horizon. GRAHAM snoozes on the sofa. PAUL offers CLIVE a nut. 
CLIVE No thank you. 
PAUL You sure? How about a cup of coffee? (sees he's tempted) Come on Hulk, I'll get you a nice cuppa J. PAUL goes back to the galley, flicking GRAHAM on the nose as he passes. GRAHAM wakes up with a start. 
PAUL Hey, look who's up! 
GRAHAM Hello Paul. GRAHAM approaches CLIVE who ignores him. 
CLIVE 
(TO GRAHAM) How come you know so much? 
GRAHAM We had quite a long chat while you were unconscious. CLIVE looks miffed. 
GRAHAM ...while you were asleep. 
PAUL You want a bagel Clive? 
CLIVE No thanks. 
PAUL Graham? 
GRAHAM Yes please. 
CLIVE Go on then, I'll have half. 
PAUL (O.S.) You want anything on it? 
CLIVE Jam. 
PAUL (O.S.) What? 
CLIVE Jelly. 
PAUL Gotcha. PAUL heads to the kitchen. The boys drive in silence. 
GRAHAM I gave your jeans a swill and hung them up. 
CLIVE Thank you. So, do you know where we're going? 
GRAHAM Just North. He said we had to make a right at Utah. 
CLIVE Why can't he tell us? 
GRAHAM He said it was a surprise. 
CLIVE Do you trust him, Graham? I mean, is he Strider or Black Rider? 
GRAHAM Strider, definitely. 
CLIVE You'd better be right. I don't want to wake up and find him inserting a probe into my anus. 
GRAHAM It's okay, he doesn't do that. PAUL returns with three bagels on one long finger. 
PAUL Bagel time! The dashboard beeps. PAUL jumps throwing them into the air. 
GRAHAM Fuel level's critical. 
PAUL Sorry, I had a warning light just like that on my ship. 
GRAHAM For fuel? 
PAUL Anti-grav failure. CLIVE is looking at the sat-nav on the computer. 
CLIVE There's a place called Ely five miles from here. It's small but there should be a gas station. 
GRAHAM Roger that, number one. 
CLIVE smiles at GRAHAM and flashes PAUL a triumphant look. PAUL coughs loudly, barely disguising the word "Geeks". 
INT. RV - MORNING 
GRAHAM and CLIVE peer out at the gas station. It appears deserted. PAUL has his head in the fridge, he cracks open a V8, strolls to the front of the RV and honks the horn. An OLD MAN peers out of the gas station window and waves. 
CLIVE Paul, don't do that! 
PAUL Here's what I need. Some organic beef mince, organic pork, some veal, red onions, pine nuts, pecorino cheese, plum tomatoes, a fistful of fresh basil and 3 war ciabattas. 
CLIVE You know this is a gas station? PAUL looks disappointed. 
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 
The door to the RV opens, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out onto the forecourt, trying to look as casual as they can. 
CLIVE Ready? 
GRAHAM Ready. HOOOONNNNNKKKK! GRAHAM and CLIVE jump. 
PAUL (O.S.) Get me some more peanut M&Ms. GRAHAM goes into the store, CLIVE to the pumps. A POLICE CRUISER pulls onto the forecourt. CLIVE goes pale and fumbles the nozzle back into the pump. He walks toward the checkout as a STATE TROOPER exits his car. No matter how hard he tries, CLIVE cannot avoid reaching the door at the same time as the STATE TROOPER. He is tall, wide and bald. 
STATE TROOPER After you. 
CHRIS They find out how you can afford a Dodge Viper on troopers pay? 
STATE TROOPER Not yet. They're all over this crash on the road up to Rachel. 
CHRIS What you think's going on? 
STATE TROOPER Don't know, could be Muslims. 
CHRIS Jesus Cheeerist! CLIVE and GRAHAM sidle up to the check-out. 
STATE TROOPER You go right ahead. 
CLIVE Thank you very much, officer. 
STATE TROOPER Where're you guys from? 
GRAHAM Britain. 
STATE TROOPER Britain, huh? Nice place. No guns! 
CHRIS No guns? Jesus Cheeerist. CHRIS take the money and the boys leave. The STATE TROOPER and CHRIS watch them go. 
EXT. GAS STATION - MORNING 
The boys hurry across the forecourt past the cop car, we hear the radio spring to life as they pass. 
POLICE CONTROLLER All units, be on the lookout for a cream and brown Recreational Vehicle, no plate number at this time. Officers are advised to contain but not board. Dean, if you still at Gas and Go, bring back a quart a milk and a box of doughnut holes? Dean? GRAHAM and CLIVE stop and stare, listening intently. 
HOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKK! 
INT. RV - SOMETIME LATER 
PAUL sit on the sofa catching M&Ms in his mouth. GRAHAM drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat. 
CLIVE It's find for you. You'll get whisked back to whatever lab they kept you in and we'll be arrested for harbouring a fugitive and sent to Guantanamo Bay. PAUL laughs. 
CLIVE Why's everything so funny? They think we're Muslims. 
PAUL That's their excuse for everything. There are worse things you can be. We had a Muslim guy at the base. Systems analyst called Yusef. We used to do karaoke on Tuesday nights. You should'a heard him do Matthew and Son. Shame I didn't get a chance to say salam alaikum. 
CLIVE Paul, the authorities know we're in an TV. 
PAUL We're hardly the only RV on the road. Trust me, if we stay off the highways, keep to the back routes, we'll have a nice uneventful journey. BANG!!! Something strikes the windshield. Everyone jumps. GRAHAM bring the RV to a halt. Silence. 
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY 
The door to the RV swings open, CLIVE and GRAHAM step out. The desert road is silent. We can see for miles. On the road lies a yellow and black bird, it is very dead. 
PAUL Fuck, that made me jump. 
CLIVE Ah yes, the waspish markings of a Scott's Oriole. Unmistakable. 
PAUL What a waste. 
GRAHAM Poor thing. 
CLIVE Nothing anyone could've done. PAUL looks at them, then scoops the bird up in his hands. 
GRAHAM What are you doing? PAUL closes his eyes. His skin ripples with color as he sways slightly. The bird's eyes flicker, its head lifts, it opens its beak and tweets. GRAHAM and CLIVE are astounded by what they are seeing. 
GRAHAM It's a miracle! 
PAUL stuff the bird in his mouth with a grotesque crunch. 
PAUL I'll miss these. 
CLIVE Why would you do that? 
PAUL I'm not gonna eat a dead bird, am 
I? 
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY 
ZOIL and his men are parked on the forecourt of the gas station. ZOIL is talking to the STATE TROOPER and CHRIS. 
STATE TROOPER By the time I got the bulletin, they were long gone. Seemed like nice fellas to me. 
CHRIS Is it true they was Muslims? 
STATE TROOPER They said they were British. 
ZOIL I think you can be both. 
PAUL Okay, that's great. I just wondered. I'm cool with it. Everyone's "bi' where I'm from. It's all about the pleasure thing, you know? We've evolved beyond paranoid notions of gender identity. I mean, procreation is only the functional aspect of sexual congress right? The human race is fairly advanced but most males still act like a cornered tiger if you imply the like "smoking the bone' and let's face it they probably do. Look at single sex, empirical institutions, boarding schools, prisons, pirate ships, places where the choice has been removed, everyone's banging everyone else and there isn't a whiff of socio-cultural angst. Get out into the real world and guys are getting smacked int he chops for wearing pink socks. You think you're so sophisticated because you can distinguish yourself from your own reflection but ultimately you're part of a deeply neurotic species and you'd all be a lot better off if you stopped worrying and learned to love the bum. 
CLIVE What are you trying to say? 
PAUL Maybe you should start smoking. 
INT. RV - EVENING 
Later, the RV pulls up to gate at the front of an RV park. GRAHAM is now in the Chewie seat, PAUL stands behind, steadying himself on the backs of their chairs. 
CLIVE Great find, Graham. 
GRAHAM I sourced a website listing off the beaten track, North American RV parks. 
PAUL I really lucked out with you nerds, didn't I? GRAHAM and CLIVE look proud. CLIVE drives the RV over a speed hump into the park. PAUL loses his balance and falls over. GRAHAM and CLIVE laugh. They pull up to a gate. 
GRAHAM It's awfully quiet. 
CLIVE Just the way we like it. PAUL scrambles to his feet, reaches across CLIVE and rest on the horn. 
HOOOOOOONNNNK! 
CLIVE Stop doing that! 
GRAHAM Someone's coming. PAUL shimmers and disappears. GRAHAM and CLIVE yelp. 
VOICE Hello? 
CLIVE (quietly to Graham) We're just a couple of regular guys on a tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest. 
GRAHAM I don't think she heard you. 
CLIVE I was talking to you. 
GRAHAM Oh, sorry. 
VOICE Hello? GRAHAM opens the door. RUTH BEHE, a young woman in her mid- twenties stands outside. She is pretty but has no idea. She wears glasses, one eye of which is blacked out. GRAHAM stares at her. We hear the slide guitar moment from Olivia Newton John's "Hopelessly Devoted To You". 
RUTH Good evening, I'm Ruth Behe. 
CLIVE Hello Ruth. Do you mind if we come in? 
RUTH Sure. Park in Bay 9. The charge is $50 for the night, plus $10 for hook ups an I'll need to hang onto an ID too. CLIVE disappears, leaving GRAHAM and RUTH alone. 
GRAHAM We're just a couple of regular guys on tour of the less touristy side of the American midwest. 
RUTH Where you heading next? 
GRAHAM Uh, east... apparently. CLIVE returns with his passport. RUTH looks at it. 
RUTH England? 
CLIVE Yes. London. 
RUTH I love London. 
CLIVE Have you been? 
RUTH No. Did you know it was founded by the Romans in AD 43 as Londinium? 
GRAHAM/CLIVE Yes. 
RUTH Oh. I'd love to go someday. 
GRAHAM You should. 
RUTH There's lots a places I wanna go. Europe. Asia. The Antipodes. The world's a big place. I need one of these though. 
CLIVE You don't have a passport? RUTH shakes her head forlornly. GRAHAM and CLIVE stare. 
MALE VOICE (O.S.) RUTH! RUTH! Get in here! I'm hungry 
RUTH That's my father. I'll come over and take your money in the morning. Have a pleasant night now, won't you? RUTH opens the gate to allow CLIVE to drive through. GRAHAM watches RUTH intently as they pass. 
CLIVE Doors to manual and cross check. Graham? Graham? 
GRAHAM Hmmm? PAUL re-materializes next to GRAHAM and CLIVE. 
PAUL 
BOO! 
EXT. RV PARK - NIGHT 
PAUL I know, right? Time flies when you're confined to a U.S. military installation. 
CLIVE Why did you come to earth? 
PAUL I'm the vanguard of a highly aggressive invading force. 
CLIVE What?! 
PAUL I'm fucking with you, man. I was on a science mission actually. Meteorological reconnaissance. We were surveying atmospheric conditions on CO2 spiking, M-Class planets. My specialist subject is tornadoes right? So I'm buzzing around the mid-west, looking for twisters and all of a sudden my A.G.G. goes offline and I crash in the middle of some field. 
(MORE) 
PAUL (CONT'D) Next thing I know, this little girl is pulling me out of the wreck and then a bunch of army guys come along and cart me off to Area 52. 
CLIVE 
PAUL No, it's 52. Area 51 is just full of old Pan Am jets and mini disc players and shit. It's another "clever subterfuge." GRAHAM joins them with the food. 
PAUL Just telling him about Area 52. 
GRAHAM Ha ha yeah. 
PAUL So, with my cover blown and the natives cautious but friendly, I figured we might as well indulge in a little file sharing. 
CLIVE Mulder was right! 
PAUL Mulder was my idea. They chuckle. CLIVE gives PAUL the bottle of gas. 
CLIVE Would you like a go? PAUL takes the bottle and squirts it on the fire, making the Hendrix face. They laugh loudly. 
EXT. BEHE RESIDENCE - NIGHT 
RUTH watches through her window. GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL are on the other side of the RV. Nevertheless, RUTH can see three pairs of dancing legs underneath the vehicle, silhouetted against the campfire. She frowns. 
MOSES BEHE (O.S.) 
RUTH! RUTH backs away into the shadows. 
INT. RV - MORNING 
It is very early in the morning. PAUL is asleep on the sofa. There is a knock at the door. PAUL vanishes. GRAHAM and CLIVE emerge from the bedroom in dressing gowns. 
CLIVE Who is it? 
RUTH (O.S.) It's Ruth. GRAHAM and CLIVE look at each other nervously. CLIVE opens the door, as GRAHAM straightens his hair. 
RUTH Good morning. 
CLIVE Good morning. 
RUTH May I come in? 
GRAHAM Yes. CLIVE give GRAHAM a "what the hell are you thinking?' Look as RUTH comes aboard. RUTH surveys the interior of the RV. 
RUTH Was everything to your liking? 
CLIVE Yes, thank you. 
RUTH Where's the other one? 
CLIVE The other one? 
RUTH It's okay, we don't charge by the person. That was three pairs of legs I saw last night cavorting round the camp fire, right? 
CLIVE Oh the other one. Um... 
PAUL I'm in the can. I ate a closed mollusc. PAUL blows a massive raspberry to prove his point. GRAHAM and CLIVE look embarrassed. GRAHAM changes the subject. 
GRAHAM I like your shirt. The shirt has a picture of Jesus shooting Charles Darwin in the head. Underneath it reads, "Evolve this!" 
RUTH Thanks. I got it at my church. 
GRAHAM Why would Jesus want to shoot Charles Darwin? 
RUTH 
(BRIGHTLY) Because of his theories. Are you men of God? 
GRAHAM Would you like a coffee? 
CLIVE I suppose we're men of science. 
GRAHAM 
PAUL burst out of the BEHE RESIDENCE, pursued by MOSES who is loading a shotgun. 
PAUL 
GO! GO! GO! The RV start to move forward. The door swings open and GRAHAM appears, beckoning to PAUL. PAUL reaches the door, just as MOSES levels the gun at his target. PAUL leaps into GRAHAM's arms, disappearing inside the RV, as MOSES fires off a booming shot. The BEHE mailbox explodes into pieces, as the RV careens off out of the trailer park. 
INT. RV - DAY 
Blackness. RUTH wakes up. Panic in her eyes. CLIVE drives, GRAHAM sits on the sofa, biting his nails. 
GRAHAM Hi. 
RUTH Where am I? PAUL leans round from the Chewie seat and smile. 
PAUL Hey, look who's up. 
RUTH 
DEMON! 
GRAHAM Would you like a cup of tea? RUTH starts to pray furiously. 
GRAHAM I'm so sorry it had to be this way Ruth. We're definitely not going to hurt you and we'll let you go as son as we can. We were just a little concerned that you might call the police. 
RUTH You have been deceived. Deceived by an agent of Satan himself. 
PAUL (O.S.) You know I'm sitting right here? 
GRAHAM He's not a demon Ruth, he's from another world and we're helping him get home. He's not evil. He's just very rude. 
RUTH How can he be from another world? There is only one world. Our world, created by God the Father. PAUL sits down next to GRAHAM. RUTH whimpers. 
PAUL Look, if it makes you feel any better, my existence only disproves the notion of the Abrahamic, Judeo- Christian God, as well as all single earth theologies. Science still hasn't categorically rule out the notion of divinity, even though evolutionary biology suggest the non-existence of a creator by probability alone. 
RUTH How could that possibly make me feel any better? 
PAUL Jesus Christ, I was just trying to be nice! 
GRAHAM I think what Paul's trying to say is, just because there are other inhabited planets, it's not the end of the world. 
RUTH This isn't happening! You're a hallucination. You're not real. You're a test. A test from God. 
PAUL You can't win can you? RUTH starts to pray furiously, speaking in tongues, making an awful noise. 
CLIVE I can't drive like this. We'll have to drop her off and take our chances. 
GRAHAM No! 
PAUL Oh, for God's sake. PAUL walks over to RUTH and places his and across her forehead. He appear to go into a trance. RUTH's eyes roll up into her head. We see a lightening montage of images. The cosmos, the surface of a planet, others like PAUL, PAUL's ship crashing into the ground. The images speed up as PAUL telepathically send his knowledge into RUTH's mind. They collapse in a heap on the floor. PAUL sparks up a cigarette. 
GRAHAM What did you do to her?! 
PAUL I broadened her horizons. 
GRAHAM Can you broaden mine? 
PAUL No, it's tiring. GRAHAM goes over to where PAUL is lying. 
GRAHAM Oh please. 
PAUL Come here then. PAUL puts his hand on GRAHAM's head. GRAHAM's eyes go all fluttery. We don't see the images this time. GRAHAM falls. 
CLIVE Oh great! Everyone knows the secrets of the universe apart from me. He always knew what was going on in Buffy before me because his mum had cable. 
PAUL Can't I just tell you? 
CLIVE No spoilers! PAUL sighs, then with enormous effort, reaches up and zaps CLIVE who falls to the floor. Everyone lays inert. 
GRAHAM 
(WEAKLY) Maybe I should make that tea? 
EXT. RV PARK - DAY 
THREE BLACK SEDANS are parked in the BEHE RV park. 
MOSES BEHE (O.S.) I didn't call the government. I called the po-lice. 
INT. BEHE RESIDENCE - DAY 
ZOIL Given your description of the intruder, the police felt your call was perhaps better directed to us. 
MOSES BEHE And who are you? 
GRAHAM Are you alright? 
RUTH He can't be from space. It's not possible. 
GRAHAM Ruth, you saw for yourself. It's not just possible, it's probably. There's probably millions of intelligent civilizations. 
RUTH So, where is everybody? 
GRAHAM Well, one of them is right there. RUTH and GRAHAM look back at the RV. PAUL is stood on the dashboard with his bare buttocks pressed against the window. CLIVE is trying not to laugh. 
RUTH Everything I've ever been told is a lie. My purpose. My truth. All false. DO you know how that feels? To suddenly have nothing? 
GRAHAM Just because your truth wasn't the truth, it doesn't mean there is no truth, Ruth. 
RUTH Huh? 
GRAHAM I understand you're probably feeling very confused right now. Religious belief systems are devised to give us context and security. To stop us feeling lonely and unimportant. 
RUTH I do feel lonely and unimportant! How can this all be an accident? It doesn't make sense. Did you know the reason we have solar eclipses is because the sun is exactly 400 times bigger than the moon and the moon is exactly 400 times closer to the earth? GRAHAM considers saying "yes' but decides against it. 
RUTH How can that be an accident. 
GRAHAM It isn't, it's a coincidence. Or it probably is. That's the beauty of the universe. 
RUTH But what's the point? If there's nothing afterwards, what's the point in living? 
GRAHAM This is the point, Ruth. Right now. This conversation. That tree, your next cheeseburger. Life is a miracle. People spend so much time focusing on rescuing the princess, they forget how much fun it is to fight the dragon. 
RUTH Huh? 
GRAHAM Carl Sagan said "A religion, old or new, that stressed the magnificence of the universe as revealed by modern science might be able to draw forth reserves of reverence and awe hardly tapped by the conventional faiths.' 
RUTH Huh? 
GRAHAM It's okay not to know, Ruth. It's wonderful because it means we still have things to learn. We still have life to live. 
RUTH I'm frightened. 
GRAHAM So am I, but it passes, sort of. Ruth, we're on an amazing adventure and I think you should come with us. I know you feel confused and lost but if you get back on board that RV, you might just find the very thing you're looking for. 
RUTH I... I'm not sure. 
GRAHAM I'm sure Ruth. I'm sure because I can honestly say, I have never talked to a woman for this long without blushing. 
RUTH That's so sweet. GRAHAM blushes, deep, dark, red. 
INT. RV - DAY 
GRAHAM and RUTH get back onto the RV. GRAHAM looks pleased with himself. 
GRAHAM She's going to be fine. I think your hair looks good by the way. You look like Storm. 
RUTH Who's Storm? 
PAUL From X-Men. 
GRAHAM Exactly. RUTH goes to the bathroom. 
RUTH (O.S.) 
AAARRRRGGGHHHHH! MY FREAKIN' HAIR! 
EXT/INT. RV - DAY 
The RV drives across the rugged countryside. GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL appear in various combinations. GRAHAM drives with PAUL in the Chewie seat, CLIVE sleeps on the sofa, RUTH can be seen sitting on the bed at the back. CLIVE drives with GRAHAM in the Chewie seat. PAUL just behind, RUTH on the sofa. She is staring at PAUL. PAUL turns round, she looks away. PAUL drives, CLIVE sits in the Chewie seat, GRAHAM and RUTH just behind. The RV weaves from side to side. 
CLIVE Small corrections! Small corrections! RUTH drives. Everyone else is asleep. 
EXT/INT. ZOIL'S CAR/HAGGARD'S CAR/O'REILLY'S CAR - DAY 
We see ZOIL's convoy. ZOIL drives, his eyes intent on the road, searching. He reaches down out of shot, then brings a taco to hi mouth and takes a bit. A truck passes. We see HAGGARD in his car, talking animatedly on his cell phone. The truck passes. We see O'REILLY in his car, he is asleep at the wheel. The truck passes, horn blaring. O'REILLY wakes up suddenly, looking rattled. 
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY 
The RV is parked up. It is a little speck on an enormous landscape. Next to the highway is a sign which reads "YOU ARE NOW LEAVING UTAH.' Underneath this a separate sign reads 
"LEAVING PACIFIC TIME ZONE ENTERING MOUNTAIN TIME ZONE.' PAUL leaps back and forth over the line. 
PAUL 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock, 11 o'clock. Come on! It's fun. We see CLIVE, GRAHAM and RUTH standing in the middle of the road watching PAUL. 
RUTH This is the furthest I've ever been. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
INT. HIGHWAY. ROADSIDE - NIGHT 
ZOIL talks on a satellite phone. HAGGARD works on a laptop nearby. O'REILLY listens in. 
ZOIL Where are you? Where are you headed? 
RUTH (O.S.) I don't know. 
ZOIL Look, I know you think you're doing the right thing but I promise you, I'm only thinking about you. And Paul. You care about Paul, don't you? 
RUTH (O.S.) I don't know how I feel about him. He's weird and also, rude. 
ZOIL Yes he is. 
RUTH (O.S.) I asked him why he wore shorts and he said if he didn't I'd see his big spaceman balls. 
INT. BAR. PAY PHONE - NIGHT 
Loud giggles, followed by angry shushing from ZOIL. 
RUTH Who's there with you? 
ZOIL (O.S.) Ruth, please listen to me. Your father is worried about you. We want to get you home. I need you to tell me where you are. 
RUTH He showed me things. 
ZOIL You're not still talking about his balls, are you? 
RUTH I... i just want to know what's real. I'm confused. I... I... RUTH struggles. Her expression shows great conflict. 
HAGGARD (O.S.) 
WE GOT HER! 
ZOIL (O.S.) Damnit, Haggard! RUTH panics and slams down the phone. She realizes what she may have done and rushes back toward the bar, slamming into two men. The MEATHEADS, drunk, look down at her, amused. 
JAKE Hey, slow down there cyclops. 
RUTH I need to get to my friends. 
GUS Why the hurry? You know I got a friend with one eye who'd love to meet you. 
RUTH I happen to have two eyes actually. I just have a severe stigmatism. 
JAKE You should get that fixed up. Reckon you'd be kinda pretty in the right light. 
GUS Yeah, the dark. 
RUTH Papa said the Lord would fix it. 
GUS The Lord ain't gonna fix nothing sweetheart. 
RUTH No shit. RUTH plants her knee firmly into the groin of GUS. He doubles up knocking his friend over. RUTH bolts. 
INT. BAR - MOMENTS LATER 
GRAHAM and CLIVE are clutching brown paper bags full of food, RUTH returns from the Phone. 
GRAHAM How's your dad? 
RUTH We need to leave now. 
CLIVE We're still waiting on a wet fries. The two MEATHEADS emerge from the pay phone. Angry. 
JAKE Holy shit! It's the space faggots that dinged the fuck-mobile! 
CLIVE Look, I'm terribly sorry. Perhaps we can exchange insurance details? 
JAKE I'm sorry I don't speak "nerd'. GRAHAM and CLIVE look terribly offended. 
GUS These the "friends' you told us about, baby? 
RUTH Yes, they are. 
JAKE Well whaddya know? Small world. 
RUTH We were just leaving. 
GUS I don't think so. 
JAKE grabs RUTH. GRAHAM pushes him hard in the chest. 
GRAHAM Leave her alone! 
CLIVE Thank you. He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers. 
GRAHAM You can sleep in my bunk if you'd like. She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back. 
GRAHAM I'd use a pen to push the tissues off the bed. I've had a cold. 
EXT. DESERTED TOWN - NIGHT 
GRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing store. PAUL looks in the window. 
PAUL Hey Graham. Check this out. What d'ya think? PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a child, displayed in the window. 
PAUL I'd look pretty hot, right? 
GRAHAM Space cowboy. 
PAUL Steve Miller Band. I love that song. Speaking of midnight tokers, I got a littler herbal refreshment in my pants. Do you guys partake? 
GRAHAM No. 
PAUL Shame. I get it from the military. This is the shit that killed Dylan. 
GRAHAM Bob Dylan's still alive. 
PAUL Is he? CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer. 
CLIVE Let's party! 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint. 
GRAHAM So why "Paul'? It's not very, you know, alien. 
CLIVE Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or something? 
PAUL No. 
GRAHAM P-o-o-u-r-l? 
PAUL No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or the little guy from Simon and Garfunkel. 
CLIVE Paul Simon. 
PAUL Paul Simon. Paul's not my real name. It's a name I got given. 
GRAHAM What's your real name? 
PAUL You won't be able to pronounce it. 
CLIVE I can speak Klingon. 
PAUL What a geek. 
CLIVE Hey! 
GRAHAM Come on, what's your real name. PAUL opens his mouth and screeches. 
PAUL Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa. 
CLIVE Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa. 
PAUL That's pretty good. 
GRAHAM Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger. 
PAUL Fuck you! 
CLIVE Calm down, Rog. More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint. 
GRAHAM You look like a poster on a student's wall. 
PAUL That was my gag! "Take me to your dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine. Never saw a dime. 
GRAHAM You never answered my question. Why Paul? Who called you Paul? 
PAUL The little girl who found me when I crashed. It was terrible actually. I killed her dog. I didn't mean to! My ship sort of landed on it. When the military arrived I was delirious; I kept saying "Paul? Paul?" It was the only English I knew, because I'd heard the little girl saying it over and over. Spooks thought it was my name. 
CLIVE She called her dog Paul? 
PAUL Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles. 
GRAHAM What happened to the little girl? 
MRS. NASH Oh, come on now, Keith. If you carry on like this, you'll have to come with me to Dress Barn. 
KEITH NASH Honestly Mommy, he was an alien and his name was Paul! 
MRS. NASH Whoever hard of an alien called Paul? 
HAGGARD is suddenly kneeling at KEITH NASH's side. O'REILLY stands nearby. 
HAGGARD What did you say, kid? 
MRS. NASH Excuse me. Who are you? 
HAGGARD Agent Haggard Ma'am, Secret Service. 
MRS. NASH Secret Service?! 
HAGGARD Kid? 
KEITH NASH He was in the shop. 
HAGGARD Is he still in there? KEITH shakes his head. 
O'REILLY Did he say where he was going? KEITH looks at his comic. The ZOIL style agent, shooting the PAUL style alien. He looks back at HAGGARD and points him in the entirely wrong direction. 
HAGGARD South. Toward New Mexico, huh? KEITH nods. HAGGARD stands, his mind racing. He looks meaningfully at O'REILLY not noticing the RV rumbling up the street behind him with CLIVE at the wheel. 
O'REILLY We've got him man! We're going to get a fucking promotion. 
HAGGARD You did good kid. Want a candy? 
KEITH NASH No thanks. 
HAGGARD Let's go. The two agents rush off. 
O'REILLY What about Zoil? 
HAGGARD Screw Zoil! 
EXT. WOODS - DAY 
MOSES BEHE kicks at the remains of the campfire. He bends down and picks something up. It is Ruth's handkerchief, now stained with dirt and blood. He screws it into his shaking hand. An engine roars. He looks up to see the RV rumbling up the road. It turns onto the Eastbound Highway. MOSES' pick up is parked about 200 yards away. MOSES starts to lumber towards it as fast as he can, which isn't very fast. 
EXT. STREET - DAY 
HAGGARD and O'REILLY sprint up to their vehicles. 
ZOIL (O.S.) Where the hell do you think you're going? HAGGARD can't hide his frustration. 
HAGGARD We picked up a lead, sir. Little kid in the town said he saw an alien. Said he was heading toward New Mexico. 
ZOIL And you were just gonna take off? 
HAGGARD Thought it best to take the initiative, sir. We were going to radio you. 
ZOIL Well now, that's mighty civil of you. We have a chain of command. I expect you to abide by it. Where d'you say he was headed? 
HAGGARD New Mexico sir. 
ZOIL Well, then let's move it. They scramble. 
ZOIL Oh, and Haggard? Don't go getting ideas about your station again. ZOIL gets into his car leaving HAGGARD looking pissed. 
INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - DAY 
MOSES drives, Ruth's bloody handkerchief gripped between his hands and the wheel. He listens to his police scanner. 
VOICE (O.S.) Zoil, what the hell's going on? 
ZOIL (O.S.) They've double back sir. They're heading toward New Mexico. 
VOICE (O.S.) You better be right about this, Zoil. I'm getting a little tired of this shit. I want that little fucker's brain in a jar by sundown. MOSES smiles darkly. 
MOSES BEHE Looks like you're going the wrong way, Agent Zoil. That's what happens when you don't got the Lord on your side. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
MOSES BEHE's pick up roars through shot, revealing a large roadside sign proclaiming LUCIFER'S CUT PRICE FIREWORK WAREHOUSE. Creep in on the sign. 
INT. RV - DAYBREAK 
The RV is parked outside the firework warehouse. RUTH and PAUL sit opposite each other at the dining table. RUTH is holding the X-Men action figure, Storm. PAUL watches her. 
PAUL He likes you, y'know? 
EXT. FARMHOUSE - EVENING 
Caption: Bethlehem Creek, Wyoming GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL stare through the window of the RV at the farmhouse glimpsed in the first scene. 
GRAHAM You don't think she's still there do you? 
PAUL That's what you're going to find out for me. 
CLIVE Us? 
PAUL I can't just knock can I? What if she's moved on and someone else answers? I'm sick of people fainting on me. I'll hang back with my buddy Ruth, you two make first contact. Just enjoy it. 
CLIVE What shall we say if it's her? We're here with the alien that killed your dog sixty years ago? 
PAUL Yes. Hurry up, there's going to be a really big storm in exactly 34 minutes. 
RUTH How do you know? 
PAUL It's my job to know. 
EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY 
GRAHAM knocks on the door. 
GRAHAM Hello? 
CLIVE Knock again. 
VOICE (O.S.) Who's there? 
CLIVE Tara Walton? 
VOICE (O.S.) Leave me alone! 
GRAHAM Okay. GRAHAM goes to leave. CLIVE stops him. 
CLIVE Miss Walton, I'm the writer, Clive Gollings and this is my friend and colleague, Graham Willy. We're from England and we're here with the alien that killed your dog 60 years ago. Silence. The sound of multiple locks. The door opens to reveal a woman (68). Grey, dishevelled but with fire in her eyes. She scowls at GRAHAM and CLIVE. 
TARA What is this, some kind of joke? 
CLIVE It's no joke. PAUL materializes between GRAHAM and CLIVE. 
PAUL Hello Tara. TARA's faces sickens. She falls backwards into the house. 
PAUL Aw nuts. 
INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. FRONT ROOM - DAY 
GRAHAM, CLIVE, RUTH and PAUL all sit on a sofa. TARA sits opposite, staring at PAUL. 
RUTH Maybe I should make some tea. 
TARA Where are my manners? I never really have guests. Nobody comes up here. I go whole weeks without seeing a soul. 
TARA goes to the kitchen. She can be seen from where they are sitting. She turns the gas on and strikes a cooking match. PAUL looks pained, struggling for something to say. 
PAUL Can I do anything to help? TARA stand in the kitchen doorway, the lit match in her hand. PAUL stands and walks toward her, she watches him. 
TARA I've only just stopped believing in you, y'know? Spent a very long time trying to convince folk about what happened that night. My parents, my friends. Everyone thought I was mad. They told me it was a meteor that squashed little Paul. Took me away and did tests they did, said it was for cosmic radiation. They said I was concussed, hallucinating, but I knew you were real. I pulled you from that spaceship myself. Sat with you till the men came and took you away. If Pop hadn't had to go to Casper, he would have seen you too. They kept telling me I'd imagined it but I knew different. Pop tried to understand but they filled his head with "delayed this' and "post- traumatic that'. He just used to smile and say "there, there Tara'. He got sick when I was seventeen and died a few years later. I inherited this place. Word got out about my story not long after it happened, so I didn't really have any friends. Kids used to throw stones at the house and call me names. I just kinda retreated into myself. I'd spend whole nights up on the roof, staring at the sky, hoping to catch a glimpse of you again. I always believed that one day you"d come back and here you are. The match flame reaches her fingers, she shakes it out. 
TARA Listen to me gabbing. Milk and sugar? 
PAUL I'm so sorry. 
TARA What for? 
PAUL For killing your dog and ruining your life. 
TARA That doesn't matter. Don't you see? You're real. I was right and all those folk that said I was crazy? Well, they can all go fuck themselves. 
PAUL It's good to see you, Tara. The tinkle of glass. Something hits the floor. A tear gas canister spins at their feet, spewing thick fog. 
TARA Now, where do you suppose that came from? 
PAUL Fuck a duck! Get out! 
GRAHAM/CLIVE Shit! 
PAUL Tara, where's the back door? 
TARA In back. The gang bustle out of the room just as the front door splinters inward, revealing O'REILLY in a gas mask. 
INT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE. BACK ROOM - DAY 
TARA My weed! 
EXT. TARA'S FARMHOUSE - DAY 
ZOIL is blackened and dazed, draped over HAGGARD's shoulder. His eyes focus on a figure in the near distance. MOSES BEHE picks himself up and lumbers off towards his truck. HAGGARD drops ZOIL and runs to his car. 
ZOIL Damnit Haggard, wait! HAGGARD takes off. ZOIL staggers to his car and with great difficulty, takes off in pursuit, narrowly avoiding MOSES BEHE's truck. Lightening flashes. Loud thunder. 
INT. RV - DAY 
CLIVE floors it. RAIN lashes down. The sky is almost black. 
GRAHAM Your dad's persistent, isn't he? 
RUTH You have no idea. CLIVE sees their pursuers in his wing mirror. 
CLIVE I think we have a problem. 
GRAHAM What do we do? 
PAUL Go left. 
CLIVE What? 
PAUL 
GO LEFT! CLIVE hauls the wheel left. The RV leaves the road and bounces across the scrub. TEAM PAUL hang on for dear life. 
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY 
HAGGARD, ZOIL and MOSES follow the RV across the scrub. 
INT. ZOIL'S CAR - EVENING

INT. HAGGARD'S CAR - EVENING 
HAGGARD In pursuit, sir. 
VOICE Who the hell is this? 
HAGGARD Haggard, sir. Agent Zoil has been compromised. I'm assuming command. 
ZOIL (O.S.) Now wait a goddamn minute! 
VOICE I don't give a shit who's in command. Where' my fucking mooncoon?! 
HAGGARD Just ahead of me sir. We're heading East across scrubland just North of Mitchell Creek. 
VOICE I don't wanna hear from either of you jokers until that little mother fucker is under glass. 
HAGGARD Yes sir! HAGGARD floors it. He is manic and wild eyed. 
EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY 
We see the chase from above, the RV is in the lead, gaining behind them, is HAGGARD, followed by ZOIL, then MOSES. HAGGARD draws level. He looks up into CLIVE's eyes. 
INT. RV - DAY 
CLIVE They're trying to overtake. 
PAUL Don't let him get past. 
CLIVE Shall I ram him? 
RUTH/TARA/GRAHAM/PAUL 
YES! CLIVE wrenches the wheel hard to the left. 
EXT. SCRUB - EVENING 
The RV nudges the BLACK SEDAN which spins out of control and skids to a stop, ZOIL and MOSES scream past. HAGGARD turns the engine over. Nothing. He yells. Lightening explodes overhead, hail pings and bounces off the hood. 
INT. RV - EVENING 
CLIVE What are we doing exactly? 
HAGGARD (O.S.) You're not running this show any more Zoil. You had your chance. 
ZOIL Haggard, he knows what he's doing. 
HAGGARD (O.S.) So do I. 
ZOIL It's a trap! 
INT. RV - EVENING 
CLIVE They're still coming! 
RUTH 
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO DO? 
PAUL Ruth, why don't you count back from 
RUTH Okay. 10...9... 
PAUL Back where I'm from, tornadoes are part of our daily life. We've learnt how to live with them, how to understand them. 
CLIVE They're gaining! 
PAUL We've learnt to anticipate their behavior, know their personalities, know when they're playing games. 
RUTH 
GRAHAM What games? 
RUTH 
PAUL Hide and seek? 
RUTH 
CLIVE looks into his wing mirror, just as the tornado snakes down out of the sky between them and HAGGARD. 
CLIVE Great Caesar's ghost! 
RUTH How did you do that? How did you know? 
PAUL Evolution baby. 
EXT. SCRUB - EVENING 
The tornado touches down hear HAGGARD's car. He barely has time to scream before his is lifted into the vortex. 
INT. MOSES'S PICK UP - EVENING 
A wide eyed MOSES yanks hard on the wheel, spinning the truck round, heading back in the opposite direction. 
EXT. SCRUB - EVENING 
MOSES's truck hurtles past ZOIL's car. 
MOSES BEHE (O.S.) Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! Oh Jesus! ZOIL looks back toward the no unreachable RV. 
INT. RV - DAY 
CLIVE We've lost them. TEAM PAUL erupt into cheers. PAUL jumps in the air and whoops. He high five GRAHAM and pats CLIVE on the back. GRAHAM embraces RUTH and tries to kiss her, she pulls away. 
GRAHAM Sorry. 
RUTH Wait, what about Papa? 
CLIVE I only saw one car following us. 
PAUL Where's Tara? TARA comes out of the toilet. 
TARA The bulb's gone in there. 
GRAHAM That was just awesome. Amazing driving Clive. It was like G.T.A. but potentially fatal. Wasn't it, Clive? Clive? A knocking and a gurgling sound is coming from the engine. 
CLIVE Oh no. 
EXT. SMALL ROAD - EVENING 
The RV splutters to a halt. Steam rises from the radiator. It whines, coughs and dies. Cut to TEAM PAUL stood around surveying their fallen companion. A single bullet hold in the grill, reveals the cause of her downfall. 
GRAHAM There goes the deposit. 
CLIVE Fare thee well friend. You were a faithful and mighty steed. 
ZOIL 
PAUL! 
PAUL Lorenzo?! PAUL spins round. We go into slow motion. ZOIL fires. The bullet explodes from the gun, straight at us. Angle on the bullet as it passes in ECU. The shot moves round behind the bullet to reveal PAUL, looking shocked. The bullet whizzes past him, slamming into one of the soldiers. ZOIL rolls, coming to rest on one knee. He fires a second shot into the leg of the other soldier who collapses. He leaves his gun at VOICE just as the PILOT bursts from the cockpit. The PILOT fires but misses ZOIL. ZOIL takes out his shoulder, spinning him off his feet. VOICE steps forward, holding a smoking gun. 
VOICE It was you! You told him. I should've known. 
(MORE) 
VOICE (CONT'D) You've never made a mistake in your life. That's why I put you in charge of this fucking mission. 
ZOIL He's my friend! I've known him for twenty years. He introduced me to my wife damnit! 
VOICE You stupid son of a bitch. In five years, you could have been where I am. 
ZOIL I don't want to be where you are. 
VOICE Too bad, seeing as I'm the one hold'ng all the cards and when I say "cards", I of course mean big fucking gun. VOICE points his gun at PAUL. 
PAUL How'd you find me? 
VOICE It was pretty easy once we got a fix on the geek-mobile. Wasn't hard to figure out where you were headed. You always did have a flare for the dramatic. PAUL nods, a sad smile creeping across his mouth. 
VOICE Let's go. TARA stands in front of PAUL, then RUTH, then GRAHAM then CLIVE, who summons every ounce of bravery in his body. 
CLIVE He's not going anywhere. 
VOICE Be honest with yourself, two scoops. What is it that you think you can possibly bring to the table at this stage in the game? CLIVE reaches beyond his back and produces his KATANA SWORD, he holds it like a proud Samurai. 
CLIVE Blind fury. The blade falls off. 
CLIVE Bloody low grade Turkish alloy. 
VOICE Step aside, you fat nerd. 
CLIVE 
(IN KLINGON) Graham, his this man. CLIVE steps aside. GRAHAM slams his fist into the face of the unsuspecting VOICE. He staggers back but rallies quickly, blocking GRAHAM's second blow and delivering a heavy rebuke. RUTH leaps onto VOICE's back and starts pummeling his head. 
RUTH Leave him alone! VOICE hits out at RUTH. GRAHAM renews his attack. 
GRAHAM Leave her alone! VOICE throws them off and comes face to face with TARA. 
TARA Leave them alone. WHAM! She whacks VOICE across the face with a large stick. 
TARA You're not taking him away again. He staggers backwards and falls to the ground, unconscious. 
PAUL Thank you, Tara. 
TARA Don't mention it. PAUL rushes to ZOIL who lies on the ground, wounded. 
ZOIL The things I do for you, huh? 
PAUL You know I appreciate it. 
ZOIL Do you have any idea how difficult it was to catch you guys? 
PAUL 
(LAUGHS) Let me take a look at that. Ruth, shine the torch down here? RUTH grabs a torch and steps in behind PAUL. 
BLAM! RUTH lurches forward, suddenly limp. Everyone turns to see MOSES BEHE, shotgun smoking in his and. His face white, his eyes wide. 
MOSES BEHE Oh Lord, Ruth. My little Ruth. 
GRAHAM Noooooooooo! GRAHAM gathers RUTH up in his arms. She coughs, flecks of blood around her mouth. 
MOSES BEHE I...I never meant to shoot her. I was aiming for the goblin. 
CLIVE He's not a goblin he's from another planet. 
MOSES BEHE But he can't be. He... he... 
GRAHAM He's an alien you stupid man! Oh Ruth, Ruth I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I should have never persuaded you to come with us. RUTH focuses on GRAHAM. She smiles, weakly. 
RUTH What, and miss all this? Graham, I've lived more in the last 48 hours that I ever did in that trailer park. Isn't that what you said living was all about? Right now? This conversation? That tree? My next cheeseburger? I'm not afraid anymore Graham. I'm cold though. Hey, where is everybody? RUTH shudders and dies. TARA and ZOIL look aghast. GRAHAM buries his head in RUTH's hair. CLIVE, his eyes are filled with tears, puts his and on GRAHAM's shoulder. 
MOSES BEHE What have I done? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. A shadow is cast across RUTH. Everyone looks up to see PAUL, silhouetted against the moon. His eyes glint. 
PAUL There is no way this thing isn't gonna end happy. 
PAUL drops to his knee and places his hands on RUTH's chest. MOSES drops his shotgun and lumbers over, distraught.

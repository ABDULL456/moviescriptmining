Third Draft 
FADE IN: 
EXT. PRAGUE - NIGHT 
On a hill above the city is an old CATHEDRAL. The night is spooky, with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones and medieval walls. 
A NERVOUS YOUNG HACKER makes his way down an alley. 
There is a DOOR at the end of the alley. MUSIC can be faintly heard from inside. 
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT 
High above the street an INTRUDER DRESSED ALL IN BLACK spies from the roof. He's watching with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES. 
He pulls out a CROSSBOW and FIRES. 
A BOLT flies, trailing CABLE. 
THUNK! It sticks into the alley wall below. 
EXT. THE ALLEY - NIGHT 
As he passes by the ominous Cathedral, the Hacker spins, sure he's heard something. 
But there's nothing there. He continues on. 
Then the Intruder comes sliding down the ZIP-LINE from above. 
WHAM! He kicks the Hacker into the wall, knocking him out. 
The Intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled features of a dashing BRITISH SECRET AGENT. His name is STERLING. 
STERLING I hate to drop in unexpectedly. 
Sterling searches the Hacker and pulls a SMALL BLACK CASE from his coat. Inside the case is a DATA CHIP. Sterling tucks it away. 
Sterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp TUXEDO underneath. He pulls out CAR KEYS. In a quick insert we see the "ASTON-MARTIN" LOGO. 
As he strolls back out the alley, he HEARS something and flattens against the wall. 
A BLACKED OUT SUV screeches to a stop, blocking his exit. 
The SUV's HEADLIGHTS illuminate the slumped Hacker. 
BAD GUYS get out to investigate, pulling out weapons. 
Cornered, Sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in the shadows. He gets to that DOOR the Hacker was heading towards. 
As he PICKS THE LOCK Sterling can hear MUSIC from inside. He smooths his hair and prepares to "blend in" with the crowd. 
INT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT 
Sterling comes through the door and his face falls. He's stepped into a loud METAL CONCERT. 
We see a GO-GO DANCER in LATEX. Onstage is RAMMSTEIN, a bizarre German industrial-metal band. 
The tattooed YOUNG CROWD slam dances and swings glo-stix over their heads. Some wear rubber BRAIN SKULLCAPS outfitted with fiber optic lights. It's a sea of SPIKED HAIR and BONDAGE OUTFITS. 
Sterling squares his jaw and starts pushing through the crowd. With his tuxedo he sticks out like a penguin in a chicken coop. 
ON THE BALCONY ABOVE THE CROWD stands a wild haired young GANGSTER with PIERCED BROWS. With him is a STREET-TOUGH GIRL with multi-colored hair. They look like a post-Apocalyptic Bonnie & Clyde. They are YORGI and PETRA. 
Yorgi checks his watch. His delivery is late. Then his CELL PHONE rings. He's getting the news from outside. 
He looks down, spots Sterling amidst the moshing crowd. With that look, that tux, there's no mistaking what he is. 
They make EYE CONTACT and Sterling gives a little nod. 
Yorgi calmly issues orders into his phone. 
Immediately VIKTOR starts moving in Sterling's direction. 
Viktor is huge, with a MOHAWK and a six-inch GOATEE. 
Sterling sees him advancing and makes for the exit, pushing through the freaky crowd. 
EXT. CONCERT HALL - NIGHT 
Kirill takes the cigarette from his ear, PUFFS IT. 
Finally, Sterling's flaming BOW TIE flutters down and lands on a LEAPING SALMON ICE-SCULPTURE above a tantalizing SEAFOOD BUFFET. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. 
A STRAFING SHOT over the city. We make a sudden left turn and SPEED OUT OF TOWN. 
We shoot over to the BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS of VIRGINIA. In the middle of NOWHERE we dive towards a COMPLEX OF BLACK BUILDINGS. 
INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Inside it's modern, cold and high tech. An elevator COUNTS DOWN to a deep basement level. 
The doors open and a TALL MAN man with a PROSTHETIC LEG strides down the empty hall. AGENT GIBBONS is African- American, a battle-scarred WARRIOR. Even with a limp he looks sturdy, confident, deadly. 
At the end of the hall is a METAL DOOR. 
INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - NIGHT 
Gibbons walks into the INFORMATION ROOM of the NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY (NSA). There are WORLD MAPS, SATELLITE IMAGES on COMPUTER SCREENS, TECHIES monitoring everything. 
If a nuclear war broke out, you could run the country from down here. 
Gibbons takes an elevator up. 
INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
The office is expensive yet devoid of personality, reflecting the shadowy nature of it's owner. One wall is GLASS, looking down on the information room. SAM TANNICK, grizzled NSA chief, looks down at the activity below. 
SAM TANNICK Come. 
Gibbons enters, stands by the desk. 
GIBBONS Evening, Sam. 
Sam remains in shadow. 
SAM TANNICK What do you have? 
GIBBONS Not a whole helluva lot. His final transmission was mangled. About something or someone called "Ahab". Whatever it is, it cost him his life. 
SAM TANNICK He was the best there was. That makes three agents lost. 
GIBBONS They're ruthless and they have a lot of firepower. It's only a matter of time before they figure out how to deploy Silent Night. Then we're gonna have a catastrophe on our hands. 
SAM TANNICK Silent Night in the hands of a bunch of impertinent cowboys 
GIBBONS We're gonna have to step in, Sam. Those CIA boys couldn't find a clown in a field of cactus. Let me take care of it. 
SAM TANNICK How will you fix it? 
GIBBONS I'll go in with a team. But first I'm going to need some intel. I'll have to put someone inside, someone new, someone they won't see coming. One of their own. 
SAM TANNICK So you'll dredge the bottom again. You've done that before. The results were... uneven. 
GIBBONS You wanna find out about rats, ask a rat. I've had my people put together a talent pool. I downloaded it to your desktop. 
Gibbons snaps on the giant FLATSCREEN on Sam's desk. He starts cycling through PHOTO AFTER PHOTO of TOUGH LOOKING MEN. 
GIBBONS The usual prospects. Convicts, contract killers, murde... 
SAM TANNICK The scum of the Earth. 
GIBBONS But programmable. And expendable. 
SAM TANNICK I've seen enough. Turn it off. 
Gibbons clicks off the screen. 
SAM TANNICK They're degenerates. There's not a man in there that would give a damn if the Chinese took over. 
GIBBONS That's exactly why we need them. 
Sam sighs, stares out at the information room. 
SAM TANNICK Get these "scum", Mr. Gibbons, bring them in. Test them. Train them. Find your man. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SKYSCRAPER - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT 
The huge ARCO TOWER rises up towards a moonlit sky. 
We see ACCOMPLICE #1 (TRAVIS PASTRANA) sneak up and take position behind a FOUNTAIN. 
At the last moment he throws out a "bucket" and his PARACHUTE OPENS. 
EXT. STREET LEVEL - NIGHT 
The bicycle comes flying down and SMASHES into the pavement. 
It bounces a full TWO STORIES back up before coming to rest. 
Xander glides down and makes his landing. Accomplices #4 and #5 rush out to help him gather up his chute and jump in the van. SIRENS APPROACH as the van makes it's escape. 
As COP CARS screech up to the skyscraper, one of them RUNS OVER the smoking wreckage of the bike. 
SLAM TO: 
TITLE SEQUENCE - HARDCORE MUSIC plays as we see a flowing TAPESTRY OF FLORID TATTOOS. SILHOUETTED against this backdrop we see the OUTLINES of NUDE WOMEN riding BMX BIKES in a HALF- PIPE, BLADING ever obstacles, SKY SURFING and doing street SKATE TRICKS. It's a collision of outlandish imagery that tells you one thing: This ain't your daddy's spy movie. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT 
Xander, now on a MOTORCYCLE, zips through traffic. He's smiling, leaning it way over on the turns. He's got another BACKPACK on his back. 
EXT. LOFT DISTRICT - DOWNTOWN - NIGHT 
Xander drives his motorcycle into the garage of his building. 
INT. XANDER'S LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT 
A FREIGHT ELEVATOR rises up, bringing Xander and his motorcycle into the loft. 
There are EXTREME SPORTS ACTION POSTERS on the walls, MOTORCYCLE PARTS and BARBELLS on the floor, and everywhere there's EXTREME SPORTS EQUIPMENT of every description. 
XANDER Sky, you there? Start packin' cause we are out of here! 
There's a NEATLY FOLDED FLAG hanging in a slightly crooked FRAME on the wall. Xander straightens it as he goes by. 
He hears her in the sectioned off "bedroom" and heads back there. 
XANDER Did I promise you a fat vacation or what? Get ready to get down in paradise. 
He comes into the bedroom to find SKY, his long-suffering girlfriend. She's a wannabe artist type. She's got SUITCASES and BOXES scattered around and she's PACKING. 
XANDER Hey, you don't need all this just to go on vacation. Unless this ain't for going on vacation... 
SKY I'm through, Xander. 
XANDER I can see that. Why? 
SKY You run around with maniacs jumping motorcycles in the desert, you break 36 bones crashing wave runners and snowboarding off cliffs, all with no health insurance... It's insane, I can't take it anymore. 
XANDER I'm having fun, what's the problem? 
SKY You have all this talent, and you waste it. You won't take a single endorsement deal. Meanwhile those other guys have their own video games! But no, you've got too much "integrity" for that. 
XANDER I don't wanna go mersh, you know that. But hey, if this is about money... 
He opens up the backpack, revealing WADS OF CASH. 
XANDER I got an advance on the next bootleg. Let's get out of here, just you and me. We'll chill out in Bora Bora for a couple months. 
She sorts through the money. 
SKY French Polynesia? This wouldn't last us a week in a cheap hotel. Do you know how expensive it is down there? 
XANDER Alright, so I'll get more. 
SKY It's not about the money, X! You never plan for anything. I can't live like that anymore, I need some stability. 
XANDER Well if you're bailing, I guess I'd better give you your surprise now. 
He pulls off his shirt. Pierced through his nipple is a DIAMOND ENGAGEMENT RING. 
SKY What...? 
XANDER I was gonna wait till the islands, but... 
SKY You're serious? 
XANDER Of course I'm serious. I bought it, didn't I? 
SKY (shakes her head) This is so typical. I can't believe you. I've barely seen you for the last three weeks and now this? Are you out of your mind? 
XANDER I don't know. I thought this is what you wanted. You want stability, here it is. 
SKY You can't just propose to me out of nowhere. You think that's going to solve our problems? I'm sorry, X. It was a kick for a while, but it's over. You're just not going anywhere. 
XANDER You're not exactly "going anywhere" yourself. 
NARCO TERRORISTS run around with AK-47's. 
Xander sneaks past EQUIPMENT covered in CAMOUFLAGE NETTING. 
A squad of Narcos runs by and Xander makes his move. 
He rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the HEADLIGHTS of a truck. 
Narcos hop out and charge forward. 
Xander raises his hands. 
XANDER You boys are too good for me. Guess I failed this one, huh? 
They grab him and haul him away. 
INT. TORTURE ROOM - NIGHT 
We see a RUSTY MEAT HOOK. A CHAIN is wrapped around it. 
Attached to the chain, his arms over his head, is Xander. 
He's in the middle of a bleak looking room. There are BLOODSTAINS on the wooden walls, the floor strewn with filthy HAY. 
Behind him against the wall Xander sees T.J. and Virg both HOG-TIED. 
XANDER So much for "every man for himself". Nice to see you again, fellas. 
T.J. They really went all out on this one. This is a pretty gnarly setup. 
VIRG Check the table in the corner. 
There's a BLOOD STAINED TOWEL COVERING a TABLE near the door. 
XANDER This oughta be good. 
Then they hear talking outside and the door is UNLOCKED. 
A very nasty looking Marco comes in. By his look he's the LEADER. 
XANDER This must be el jefe. How's it goin' jefe? Some weather we're havin'. 
Narco Guards bring in one of their PARACHUTES and toss it on the floor. They exit, closing the door behind them. 
Jefe goes to the table throws back the towel. Beneath it are HIDEOUS, BLOOD ENCRUSTED TORTURE DEVICES: a HACK SAW, a BOLT CUTTERS, KNIVES, CHISELS, a BLOW TORCH. 
XANDER What's on the menu tonight? The old blowtorch-to-the-family jewels routine, I'll bet. Hey, you want roasted nuts, let's break out the Planters. 
T.J. and Virg both crack up. Jefe gives them a withering look. 
JEFE Do you know what we do with people come round here? You know what we do with people come in our business? 
Jefe passes his hand over the various tools. He finally settles on a crude MACHETE. He walks amongst them brandishing it. 
JEFE We cut the Achilles tendon. Your feet flop around like a marionette. You ain't walkin' nowhere no more. Sound good, tough guy? Or maybe instead you wanna tell me something. 
He stops in front of Xander. 
JEFE Whatchu doing here? 
XANDER Oh, I don't know. It was an accident. 
JEFE That's some accident, hombre. You accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard. 
He BACKHANDS Xander across the face. 
JEFE We seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. U.S. Army. You got some friends here, jump out with you guys? 
XANDER We're anti-social. We don't have any friends. 
Jefe SLAPS him again. 
JEFE No friends, huh? That's funny, I don't know no U.S. Army that comes without no friends. That's cuz U.S. Army is pussies. They always come with the five hundred guys and the helicopters and the see-in-the-dark glasses. So don't you tell me you all alone out here, my friend. You bullshitting the wrong guy. 
Xander looks over at T.J. and Virg. 
XANDER Who's writing this dude's dialogue? 
VIRG He's a pretty good actor, though. 
T.J. Makes the diner look like a sixth grade play. He's even got them crazy eyes. 
JEFE You ain't begun to see crazy yet, amigo. 
XANDER We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'. 
JEFE You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling. 
Looking the other way, he spots Virg running back his way. 
He's been corralled by one of the Helicopters. 
He's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's Night Sun. 
Xander darts out and GRABS him, pulling him under the camouflage netting. 
VIRG They're all over the place! What the hell's going on? 
XANDER Looks like we're in the middle of the drug war. 
The Helicopter lights up the camouflage netting. 
They're pinned down. 
XANDER Alright Mr. free-for-all, you go that way, I'm gonna go this way. They can't follow us both. 
They squat down in runners stances, the helicopter kicking up DUST all around them. 
XANDER Go! 
They jet off in opposite directions. 
Xander books, running for all he's worth. His cuffed hands and the dangling chain make it difficult. 
He's heading straight into the FIELD OF POT PLANTS. 
Suddenly the massive SPOTLIGHT picks him out. 
XANDER Shit! 
The CHOPPER swoops down after him. 
Its big GATLING GUNS turn, aiming right at him. 
BRAAAAAAAAPPP! The guns cut loose, tearing up the ground right behind him. 
Xander sprints, the chopper after him like Cary Grant in "North By Northwest", except instead of corn fields, Xander's running through a field of HUGE MARIJUANA PLANTS. 
Xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him. 
Xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the plants. 
All around him it's a chaos of Helicopters and GUNFIRE. 
Two choppers attack the factory building, BLASTING it with their guns. Narcos run terrified. 
Xander notices a FAT PURPLE BUD on the plant right in front of him. He SNAPS IT OFF. 
XANDER I'm gonna need to hit the trees after a night like this. 
He tucks it-into his shirt and takes off through the POT FOREST. 
Xander finally spots a vehicle. It's a TRUCK LADEN WITH BAILS OF COCAINE. He heads for it. 
Then the SPOTLIGHT finds him again and the Chopper swings around. The gatling guns RIP the plants to pieces all around him. 
Xander hauls ass, heading for the truck. 
Bullets chew up the dirt all around him. 
As the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns RAKE THE TRUCK. 
There is a FLASH as the GAS TANK goes up. 
WHOOOOPPHH! A SUPERNOVA OF FIRE AND HIGH-GRADE COKE erupts into the night air. 
Xander dives into a DRAINAGE DITCH. He tumbles down into FILTHY WATER. 
A powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white. 
Near him is a big DRAINPIPE leeching sewage. Xander crawls inside. 
The Chopper makes another pass overhead. 
The big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on. 
Xander gives a sigh of relief. He crawls out of the drainpipe. 
JEEPS race by on the road right above him as MILITARY MEN flood the compound. There's no going back. 
Xander turns and makes his way along the tree line. 
The chopper and gunfire are in the distance now. Things are quieter here and he starts to relax. Bad idea. 
As he goes by, one of the TREES moves. 
Gibbons lunges and grabs Xander's throat in the vice-like grip of his thumb and middle finger. 
GIBBONS One twitch and my finger and thumb will meet inside your esophagus. Believe me, Mr. X, I've put foot to ass for my country on many occasions and I don't feel the urge to stop just yet. So think carefully before you tell me: Is "kiss my ass, Hop- along" your final answer? 
The fingers are so powerful that Xander is paralysed. He looks over, sees the bone saw start revving. 
XANDER (choking) No. 
Gibbons releases his grip. 
GIBBONS I thought you might see it my way. 
Then Xander starts walking away. 
GIBBONS Where you going, X? I said where you going? 
The Black Ops guys grab weapons, ready to stop him. 
XANDER You tell me. 
Xander climbs up the steps of the Gulfstream. 
XANDER There better be a movie on this Goddam flight. 
INT. GULFSTREAM - DAY 
Xander sits with Gibbons in big leather chairs. They are surrounded by NSA AGENTS in suits. 
A NERDY AGENT snaps an ANKLET around Xander's ankle. 
XANDER How about a pedicure as long as you're down there. What's this? Lo-Jack? 
GIBBONS Wherever you go on the planet, I'll find you. There's no quitting. If you try to take it off, a ring of needles will inject enough curare into your bloodstream to kill you before you hit the ground. Is all that clear? 
XANDER Yeah, I spy or I die. 
INT. EMPTY FIRST CLASS LOUNGE - SUNSET 
Orange light floods this beautiful airline lounge. There's a fully stocked bar, a snack table, all unused. That's because it's been sealed off for NSA use. (NOTE: perfect product placement opportunity for an AIRLINE). 
Xander, Gibbons and his Men are all silhouetted against the smoked glass windows. 
The Nerdy Agent hands Xander a Palm Pilot sized ELECTRONIC DEVICE. 
NERDY AGENT This is your communicator. You'll identify yourself by a call sign. From here on out you're Bulldog Omega 
XANDER You must stay up late to come up with shit like that. 
GIBBONS I expect you to call in regularly with progress reports. 
XANDER Fine, but I'm not gonna be no Bulldog Omega 5. 
Gibbons checks his watch. They get up and start walking. 
INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - SUNSET 
The phalanx of Agents surrounds Xander and Gibbons as they walk to the gate. The Nerdy Agent hurries to catch up. 
AGENT Uh... Call signs derive from the parameters of the mission. 
GIBBONS If he doesn't like it, we can make an exception just this once. We'll call him "Triple X". 
They walk past the gate, down the jet-way, the Agents FLASH BADGES to the GATE WORKERS. 
XANDER Up yours. 
GIBBONS Crude and defiant as always, Triple X. It fits so well because you're obscene. 
Xander is the last one to board the plane. 
XANDER Is that all? 
GIBBONS Just remember, I'll be watching. 
As the door closes, he looks back at Gibbons and his phalanx of Agents. 
XANDER I've got something for you to chew on. Next time you send someone to save the world, make sure they like the planet the way it is. 
The jet's door CLOSES. 
INT. COMMERCIAL JET - NIGHT 
Xander is in the last row against the bulkhead. He's got a personal DVD player and headphones and he's reviewing his mission. The high-tech screen shows photos, maps, cool graphics. 
The KID sitting across the aisle leans over for a look. 
KID What game is that? 
Xander picks it up and carries it into the building. 
INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY 
Dumpy furniture, roaches, cracked windows. Xander is ushered in. There's another GUY in a UGLY SUIT waiting. He is DETECTIVE MILAN SLOVO. 
SLOVO Sit down. 
XANDER I've been on a plane for twelve hours, I think I'll stand. 
Ivan 1 shoves him into a chair. 
SLOVO My name is Slovo, Czech secret police. When you are here you are under my jurisdiction, you take my orders, you do what I say. If you become any kind of an inconvenience, I'll shoot you. 
XANDER Here we go again. 
SLOVO You're here because your government is putting pressure on my government. This is an internal affair, a Czech affair, that you are interfering with. I will warn you once: Don't shit in my lawn. Get whatever information your government seeks and get our. 
XANDER First of all, you should kill whoever sold you that suit. Two, I don't wanna be here either, so just step off. Three, if you had the authority to shoot me you would've done it by now, so just ease up on the machismo, bitch. Now that we've got that sorted out, I'm gonna get some rest. 
Xander lays down on the bed. Slovo stares, burning with hatred. He heads to the door. 
SLOVO Be ready in three hours. 
Slovo exits. Ivans 1 & 2 stay, staring at Xander. 
EXT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT 
A fancy, flashy disco with an extreme sports theme. A big bouncer in a leather coat works the door. This is a highclass, expensive joint but it still looks seedy and dangerous. 
Xander and Slovo walk up to the place. Xander's wearing a Tshirt that says "RON JEREMY: AMERICAN LEGEND" complete with a photo of the Hedgehog. 
INT. HALF-PIPE DISCO - NIGHT 
A STRIPPER that looks like a runway model SLIDES across the stage on SKATEBOARD KNEE-PADS while PATRONS cheer. The disco is a combination STRIP-CLUB and CONCERT VENUE. All the STRIPPERS are outfitted in HELMETS, ELBOW PADS, G-STRINGS and BELLY SHIRTS. 
There's a WARPED TOUR BAND playing on a STAGE. On either side of the stage are two MINI-HALF PIPES that the GIRLS are cutting back and forth on. 
WEALTHY BUSINESSMEN sit in plush booths getting table dances while the dance floor is packed with sexily dressed YOUNG HIPSTERS. 
Xander gets a beer from a BUXOM COCKTAIL WAITRESS on IN-LINE SKATES. 
XANDER Nice hops. 
SLOVO The corner. Anarchy 99. 
Slovo points them out in the far corner. They're surrounded by straight faced BODYGUARDS. 
What ANARCHY 99 is doing in their booth with the STRIPPERS looks like Led Zeppelin on tour. Booze, broads, good times... These guys are living like rock stars. 
They're all here: Anders the biker, Viktor, Kirill. In the middle sit Yorgi and Petra. Petra's wearing an "I AM EVIL" Tshirt. 
SLOVO See the one with the funny colored hair? Crazy bitch stabbed one of my men in the knee-cap. There they are, American. The low-rent millionaire criminals. And you thought only your country had white trash. American? 
He looks around but Xander is gone. He heads for the exit, pushing his way through the crowd. But then he spots him, not by the door but deeper in the club. 
SLOVO Oh no! 
He sees Xander walk right up to the Anarchy 99 booth and start talking to them. 
SLOVO Jesus Christ! 
Slovo can't hear a thing, but they're obviously interested in what he has to say. Next thing he knows Xander is pointing at him and waving him over. 
SLOVO (horrified) What the hell...? 
Slovo makes his way through the crowd to the booth. Yorgi looks him up and down. 
XANDER That's the guy. 
YORGI This pizda? Never seen him before. 
XANDER (to Slovo) Who you workin' for? What do you do for a living, dickhead? 
SLOVO Uh... I am... I work in insurance. 
Xander grabs Slovo and starts searching him. 
SLOVO (panicked whisper) What the hell are you doing? 
He slams Slovo up against the wall and pulls out Slovo's police badge. 
XANDER Look what we have here. Czech 5-0 on the mack. 
The Bodyguards pull out guns and Slovo rushes for the emergency exit in a panic. In seconds he's out and gone. 
YORGI Cops. Like a plague. No matter how many you pay there's always another with his hand out. How did you pick him out? 
INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MORNING 
We see the FEET of AGENT POLK sprinting down the hallway. 
INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - MORNING 
Agent Polk looks around, spots Gibbons. He rushes to him, waving a COMMUNIQUÉ. 
Gibbons grabs the communiqué, reads it. He looks up, stunned. 
INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY 
Xander is having coffee at his window when his communicator RINGS. 
XANDER (into phone) I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars. 
INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN INFORMATION ROOM 
GIBBONS If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X. 
XANDER Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money. 
GIBBONS One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars! 
XANDER I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not? 
GIBBONS We're not after car thieves here. 
XANDER What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick. 
GIBBONS That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period. 
XANDER Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too? 
GIBBONS My friend, if you're planning on crossing me... 
XANDER I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out. 
Xander hangs up. 
INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - DAY 
Gibbons stands before Sam's desk. Sam scans over the communiqué. 
SAM TANNICK Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time. 
GIBBONS I think we should send him whatever he wants. 
SAM TANNICK You what? A wire transfer of this size? 
GIBBONS If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely. 
SAM TANNICK You're talking about a very expensive risk here. 
GIBBONS He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play. (beat) I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen. 
SAM TANNICK Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you? 
Gibbons smiles. 
SAM TANNICK Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad. 
GIBBONS So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY 
A HELICOPTER comes flying in, a MAN standing out on the strut. He's a disgruntled GADGET WRANGLER from the NSA. His name is TOBY LEE SHAVERS. 
Slovo and Xander watch from a distance as a series of METAL CASES is unloaded by CZECH COPS. Slovo lets out a low whistle. 
SLOVO Your government must know something we don't. 
Shavers walks up to them. 
SHAVERS Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s. 
XANDER That's would be me. 
Shavers gives him a disapproving look. 
SHAVERS Figures. You got someplace we can spread out my gear or what? I mean today. 
Slovo gestures towards the stairs and Shavers marches off, muttering to himself. 
SLOVO I'll leave you two alone to talk. 
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - DAY 
The TEN BLACK MARKET EUROPEAN SPORTS CARS are loaded on two TRANSPORT TRUCKS. Mafiya BODYGUARDS keep watch. 
The Ivans (in Teamster garb) inspect the cars while Xander supervises. Anders hovers around him. 
ANDERS So what you think? Beautiful! 
Sitting in an OFFICE watching are Yorgi, Kirill and Petra. 
Petra has a LAPTOP. 
YORGI Has it arrived yet? 
Petra checks her computer. ON SCREEN she's monitoring their BANK ACCOUNT. 
PETRA Nothing. He had two days. 
YORGI Perhaps he is not all he says he is. 
Outside the Ivans nod approval and Xander heads to the office. Yorgi looks to kirill, who puts his hand on his PISTOL. 
Xander opens the door. 
XANDER Very nice. I'm impressed. 
YORGI I'm somewhat less so. We seem to have a bit of a problem... 
Just then Petra's computer BEEPS and the MONEY floods into their account. Xander holds up a CELL PHONE and smiles. 
XANDER I had to inspect the merchandise first. 
YORGI Of course. 
He nods for Kirill to stand down. 
OUTSIDE - the two transport trucks are driven off by the Ivans. As they pull out they reveal ANOTHER CAR under a COVER. 
XANDER What's this? 
YORGI This is a gift. From me to you. 
Anders pulls off the cover, revealing a cherry '72 PONTIAC GTO. 
YORGI It's a little nothing, you take it. 
Xander checks out his new ride. Yorgi gets in the passenger seat. 
YORGI Come on, get in. 
Xander sits behind the wheel and STARTS IT UP. The big engine ROARS. 
XANDER You're alright, Yorgi. 
Next door to the warehouse sits an ABANDONED BUILDING. Up on the sloped roof, Slovo spies down on the transaction. He's got a camera with a big zoom lens. 
SLOVO Smile, bychara. 
Slovo snaps a few pictures but his view is obscured. To get a better vantage, he JUMPS DOWN onto a lower part of the roof. 
CRUNCH! His foot BREAKS THROUGH THE SHABBY ROOF TILE. 
Down below, Kirill hears the noise. 
KIRILL Yorgi! 
They all look to the abandoned building. 
Through the second floor window they can see Slovo's leg poking through the ceiling. 
Xander is taken aback. 
YORGI What in the hell...? 
Yorgi turns to Xander, goes for his pistol. 
Thinking fast, Xander does the same. 
They draw simultaneously and hold the guns to each other's heads as they sit in the car. Petra, Kirill and Anders draw as well, all of them covering Xander. 
YORGI What's going on, my friend? 
XANDER You tell me! You got a sniper up there or what? 
YORGI He's not with us, Xander. He must be with you. 
XANDER (he cocks the hammer) Bullshit! You get your boy off that roof or I swear to God I'm gonna give you another hole to breathe out of. 
XANDER How you gonna do that with government and rules everywhere? 
YORGI Easy. You get enough money that you grow an ass big enough for the whole world to kiss. 
Yorgi throws a fistful of money onto the dance floor. The Xed out ravers swat it around like confetti. 
YORGI You hang with us, buddy, taste some freedom! Petra! Dance with this guy! 
Yorgi melts into the dance floor crowd, leaving Xander alone with Petra. She gets up grumpily and starts dancing. Xander joins her, but she won't even look at him. 
XANDER This is great, dancing with the back of your head. 
She reluctantly turns around. 
XANDER If you got a problem with me, why are we dancing? 
PETRA Yorgi asked me to. 
XANDER You do everything Yorgi says? 
PETRA Go to hell. 
XANDER It's gonna be like that, huh? You got all bent out of shape as soon as he started dancing with someone else. Why's that? 
PETRA Mind your business. 
XANDER Did you guys used to date? That's it, right? He broke your heart and you're still soft on him. That's funny, it don't seem to fit with a tough broad like you. 
She glares at him and walks away. Xander follows. 
XANDER Where are you going? 
PETRA Why are you still hanging around? Your business is finished, you should go home. 
XANDER I was invited. What's your story? 
PETRA I don't know who you are or where you come from, but I don't like you. You ask too many questions. 
There's a big line outside the "ladies" and no line at the "men's". Petra heads into the Men's Room. 
Some DUDE whistles at her. She pushes him out of the way and enters a stall. Xander leans on the sink. 
XANDER Come on, don't front like that. You'll put a guy right off you. 
PETRA Don't even bother, X man, I'm not your type. 
XANDER That right? Why's that? 
The stall door flies open and Petra marches out. 
PETRA My chest is too small and my brain is too big. 
She shoves him to the door and stomps back to her stall. 
Xander walks back out, shaking his head and laughing. 
Across the room, Viktor shoves the D.J. out of the way and puts on "ANARCHY BURGER" by the Vandals. The rave dance is interrupted by the pounding punk beat. 
YORGI Xander, check it out! The revolution begins! 
Viktor and Anders swiftly turn the dance floor into a violent mosh pit. Xander can't help it, he actually likes these guys. 
YORGI Let's get some air, man. 
Yorgi and Xander head outside. A moment later, Kirill hurries out another door. 
EXT. PRAGUE RIVERFRONT - NIGHT 
It's late. Yorgi and Xander stroll along the river. 
XANDER You got a great set-up here Yorgi. You really know how to live. 
YORGI It's a beautiful town, Prague. It's been good to me. 
XANDER I've been here before, when I was a kid. My old man was in the service, we used to live on the Army base in Hamburg. 
YORGI You, an Army brat? I don't see that one at all. Did you join the service as well? 
XANDER Hell no. My dad was a straight up tin soldier. Somehow he pissed this general off and got himself dishonorably discharged. Had a court martial and everything. The charges were total bullshit, so he was sure he'd get his name cleared, but it didn't happen. 
YORGI Connections and politics, it's the same everywhere. 
XANDER My old man, he bought into the system, and it screwed him. So he swallowed a bullet. Me, I don't believe in nothing I can't see and touch. 
The camera suddenly ZOOMS across the city, flying over streets and houses until, half a mile away, it finds Kirill in a window with his SNIPER RIFLE. 
P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is in the crosshairs. 
XANDER What's up? Is there a problem? 
She studies his eyes, decides to risk it. 
PETRA They tell me you're an American agent. 
XANDER What are you talking about? 
PETRA There's no more time for games. They made you. There's a sniper out front waiting to put a bullet in your eye. Tell me if it's true. 
XANDER It's a long story, but yeah, more or less. 
PETRA Jesus Christ. You're going to have to go out the back. The data that you copied with your toy. Tomorrow, at six o'clock. Look it up. We're taking a trip. Be there at six and you'll have plenty to tell your people. 
XANDER If I go out the back, he'll know you've warned me. 
PETRA That's alright, I'll figure something out. 
XANDER Not an option. Just get up slowly like everything's cool. Petra, trust me. You just hung yourself out to dry for me, I'm not gonna let you down. 
EXT. BAKERY ROOF - DAY 
Kirill lays on his stomach, peering into the scope of his SILENCED SNIPER RIFLE. 
P.O.V. Through scope - he can faintly see them inside the crowded restaurant. Xander and Petra are making their way towards the exit. 
KIRILL Nice and easy, Petra... 
INT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY 
They work their way through the lunchtime crowd. 
PETRA I can't let this happen. I want you to go out the back. I'll make up some excuse. 
XANDER They'll kill you, you know they will. Besides, there is no back door. Keep smiling. Ready? Now. 
EXT. ROMANTIC RESTAURANT - DAY 
Xander's timed it perfectly so that just as they get to the door, a BUS passes by. 
Kirill keeps focused, waiting for the bus to pass. 
P.O.V. THROUGH SCOPE - Xander's head is sporadically visible through the bus windows. 
Kirill's finger tightens on the trigger... 
As soon as the bus passes he FIRES! 
But Xander's not there, he's ducked down to tie his shoe. 
CRASH! The glass door behind him shatters. Feigning surprise, Xander PUNCHES PETRA IN THE FACE and sprints down the block. 
He runs bent low, the parked cars protecting him from the sniper. Kirill fires anyway, taking out car windows. 
At the end of the block is a long staircase with a METAL RAIL down the middle. 
As he runs by an outdoor restaurant Xander snatches the SERVING TRAY from a startled WAITER, sending food and drink flying. 
He hops on the serving tray like it's a skateboard and does a RAIL-SLIDE down the length of the stairs. He's moving too fast for Kirill. 
He jumps off at the bottom and the tray POPS UP INTO THE AIR. 
Kirill BLASTS it like a clay pigeon. 
By now Xander is out of sight. Kirill pounds his rifle in frustration. 
Petra gets to the top of the stairs. She gives Kirill a "Where did he go?" look. Her nose is bloody, helping to sell her performance. 
Then she turns and looks off after Xander. She sees his GTO speeding away. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. NORWEGIAN FJORDS - LATE AFTERNOON 
We're looking down at a SHIP moving through the fjord, seen from high above. It's towing a SMALLER BOAT behind it. An airplane? No, we're at the top of the Trollveggen, Norway's legendary "Troll Wall". It's a near 5,000 foot sheer drop to the ocean. 
Six figures stand at the edge of the barren cliff. They wear webbed "squirrel" jumpsuits, helmets and parachutes. On each thigh they have pistols and on their chests they have silenced MP-5 sub-machine guns. Together they stare down at the ship. 
Petra is among them. She looks down at her watch. It is precisely 5:59PM. She glances around. The top of the cliff is rocky and flat. Xander is nowhere to be seen. 
FIFTY YARDS AWAY - we see Xander sneaking forward military style. He's got his "stakeout suit" on and is keeping low. 
HE CHECKS HIS WATCH: "6 PM" 
The members of Anarchy 99 put on their goggles and, without saying a word, they leap off the Troll Wall. 
Xander runs to the edge and looks down. He sees the group freefailing down the sheer cliff face. 
XANDER What the hell...? 
He pans over to the wet well and sees it's flooding. 
With the ballast open on only one side, the ship starts LISTING. The thing is going down. 
He pans over, clicks into "penetrator" mode, and sees the Crew pounding on the walls below decks. They're trapped, their WRISTS AND ANKLES BOUND WITH PLEXI-CUFFS. 
EXT. TOP OF TROLL WALL - LATE AFTERNOON 
Xander puts down the binoculars and gets up. 
XANDER No way, man, no way. I'm just supposed to be an observer. Aw shit. This job sucks. 
He pats his jumpsuit, checking for the buckle. 
XANDER Toby Lee Shavers, if this thing don't work, your ass is kicked. 
Xander steels himself, takes a few deep breaths. 
Then he sprints to the edge and JUMPS off the cliff... 
And that's it. He's gone. One mile, straight down. 
Suddenly we're falling with him. 
We hear the rush of air as he free-falls a dozen feet from the craggy rock face. 
The force of the wind ripples his cheeks. 
He streamlines himself into a track position and jets away from the cliff like Superman. 
Before he gets too low, he RIPS THE BUCKLE. 
Immediately his jumpsuit TEARS OFF HIS BODY in MULTIPLE LAYERS, unfurling into a full sized PARASAIL. 
Xander looks up at his parasail, relieved, and glides towards the ship. 
EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Petra spots the parasail and has to act quickly to keep Yorgi from spotting it. She grabs him suddenly and KISSES him. 
YORGI What was that for? 
PETRA I'd forgotten how exciting it is working together. 
YORGI You've been so quiet lately, Petra, I thought you no longer cared. 
PETRA Why don't we go below decks and work off some of this adrenaline. 
YORGI (smiles) Viktor! Stay the course. 
Yorgi kisses her again and heads to the cabin below. 
EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON 
Xander comes in for a perfect landing. He lands on the listing deck and undoes his harness. 
He sees several WOUNDED scattered on the deck. 
XANDER Son of a bitch! 
He looks across the water, sees the smaller boat far away. 
EXT. SMALLER BOAT - LATE AFTERNOON 
Petra looks back one last time, catching sight of Xander on the deck of the ship. She smiles, relieved. 
Then she turns solemn as she heads below decks to pay the price. 
EXT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON 
Xander gets to the wet well and sees the water flooding in. 
With the ship listing like this, the water is pouring below decks. 
INT. SHIP - LATE AFTERNOON 
Xander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold. Here is where the entire Crew has been left to drown. They are struggling to stay above water, their hands and feet bound. 
As the far end of the room is another HATCH. Water pours in from this one and Xander has to get it shut. 
He swims through the struggling Crew, spots the CAPTAIN holding his YOUNG SON above water. The water is rising rapidly, filling up the compartment. 
Xander braces his feet against the bulkhead and PUSHES, but the force of the water is too much. 
He surfaces. He's got to wait until the room floods before he can close that door. 
XANDER Right behind you. 
They keep talking, pretending to shop. 
XANDER So what's the plan with this Ahab? Are they selling it or what? 
PETRA No, something worse. He says it's a surprise, but I know him. This is his masterpiece. 
XANDER We've got to find out what it is. Can you handle that? 
PETRA (beat) There's something I didn't have time to tell you before. 
XANDER What's that? 
PETRA I'm a agent as well. KGB. I've been undercover for over a year. 
XANDER You're what? What the hell have you been doing? 
PETRA I don't know. Eight months ago I stop hearing from my people. No explanation, just silence. So I stay and I wait like I was told. Soon I'm in so far, they'd kill me if I left. Now every day I get farther and farther away from what I was. I'm like you said, a criminal. 
XANDER I'm busted up for you, but Jesus, what the hell are you doing? Those people almost drowned on that boat and you didn't lift a finger. 
This stings her. She knows well the price she paid. 
PETRA No, I guess I've been no help at all to you. 
XANDER Get your head back in the game. There are lives at stake here. 
PETRA Of course. I'll do what I can. I have to go, before they notice. 
XANDER When can I see you again? 
PETRA You can't, it's too risky. I'm not much help anyway, remember? 
Then she's off into the crowd. 
EXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - NIGHT 
The craggy surface of the wall is swathed in shadows. Xander approaches and flattens himself against it. He's all in BLACK, packed with weapons and sporting a COMBAT VEST. 
He grabs a toehold on the wall and ZOOM! He SPEED CLIMBS up the side. 
He reaches the top in seconds and scopes out the manor house. 
VIDEO CAMERAS, PATROLLING GUARDS. It's not gonna be easy. 
Xander slips over the wall down to the courtyard below. 
EXT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - COURTYARD - NIGHT 
Xander places an EXPLOSIVE on a CONTROL BOX. 
He waits for a GUARD to stroll by and then slips through a basement window. 
INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - DARKENED ROOMS - NIGHT 
Xander makes his way through a series of rooms. Finally he finds himself in a study with a window overlooking the CAVERNOUS BASEMENT of the Manor. 
Laid out below he can see the AHAB DEVICE, hanging from chains. TECHIES are working with the Anarchy 99 crew to RETROFIT the thing. 
They are installing a LAUNCHER RACK of TEN TUBES. 
Xander can't hear a thing through the thick glass. 
He takes a METAL BALL from his pocket. There's a sink in the corner and he drops the metal ball down the drain. 
INT. DRAIN PIPE 
We follow the metal ball as it rolls through the trap and down into the wall. The pipe zigzags around like a rollercoaster and then levels off. 
The ball rolls past a T-intersection, stops, and unrolls like a pill bug. 
Six metal legs appear and we see it's the ROACH CAM. It scuttles back up the pipe and makes the turn. 
INT. MANOR BASEMENT - MAIN HALL - NIGHT 
We're close on a sink as the Roach Cam comes up the pipe. It scurries into hiding just as a HAND reaches in to turn on the water. 
The roach peers out from between items on a workbench and we PUSH IN on it's VIDEO CAMERA head. 
INT. MEDIEVAL MANOR - STUDY - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON - VIDEO MONITOR - ROACH CAM P.O.V. 
We see a handheld video image of Viktor. 
VIKTOR Okay, fire one. 
Kirill is almost on top of him. 
Xander sights up and FIRES. 
The fire extinguisher EXPLODES, blinding Kirill. 
Xander makes a run for it. 
Everyone FIRES WILDLY (except for Petra), bullets tearing tapestries off the walls. 
Xander dives and crashes through the window. 
EXT. COURTYARD - SUNRISE 
Xander tuck and rolls, comes up running. 
Guards are running around, unsure just what the hell is going on. 
Xander hops on one of the TRIALS MOTORCYCLES parked nearby and fires up the engine. He hits a remote switch and BLAM! 
The EXPLOSIVE CHARGE he left earlier blows-up. 
He points the bike at a set of STONE STAIRS. They form a "ramp" that he can use to JUMP THE WALL. He GUNS THE ENGINE. 
A Guard races across the wall with a rifle, taking aim. 
Xander races and JUMPS THE BIKE over the wail. As he goes by he does a CAN-CAN AERIAL, KICKING THE GUARD OFF THE WALL before he can shoot. 
The Anarchy 99 guys run outside just in time to see him go. 
YORGI He blew the gate control. Anders! Get the bastard! 
Anders fires up the other trials bike, slings a submachine gun across his back and goes up and over. Petra watches him go, hoping for the best. 
EXT. PRAGUE STREETS - DAYBREAK 
(NOTE: action will be re-choreographed based on actual locations. Any freestyle motorcycle moves will be motivated by a physical reason) 
Xander blazes down the street, Anders racing right behind him. A wrong turn sends him into a dead end. 
At the end is a panel truck parked next to a stone wall. 
Xander slows the trials bike and drives it up the hood of the truck and onto it's roof. Balancing on the rear wheel, he hops onto the wall. 
The machine gun blasts again. Xander drives off along the top of the wall. Anders shoulders his gun and follows. 
They are riding a 15' high wall that's only a foot wide. 
They make several 90 degree turns, racing above a sleeping neighborhood. Xander sees the end of the wall ahead and takes a detour. 
He hops onto the second floor balcony of a BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION. 
INT. BUILDING UNDER CONSTRUCTION - MORNING 
CONSTRUCTION WORKERS bolt out of the way as the motorcycle leaps into their building. 
Xander pops a wheelie and slams through a BLUEPRINT TABLE. 
Anders follows, demolishing their SNACK TABLE. 
Xander darts through the building, between beams and 2 x 4's, until he reaches a skeletal STAIRCASE. 
More WORKERS appear at the bottom of the stairs so Xander goes up. He cranks up three flights of stairs and bashes onto the roof. 
EXT. THE ROOFTOPS - MORNING 
Xander looks around for a way out. The next building isn't that far away. He revs up and JUMPS ACROSS. 
Anders jams another magazine into his sub-machine gun and follows Xander. 
They jump from roof to roof, down a DESCENDING SERIES OF ROOFTOPS towards the river. Anders pulls up alongside as they race towards that last apartment building. 
Neck and neck they head for the brink. At the last jump, Xander pulls up behind Anders. 
They hit the last roof in a crunch of gravel. Anders clamps on the brakes and comes skidding to a stop, Xander right behind him. 
They skid to a stop at the very edge, with Anders balanced on his front wheel. He looks down, sees street five stories below. 
He glances back at Xander, sweat beading, struggling to keep his balance. Xander observes him coolly, totally in control. 
Anders reaches for his machine gun. Xander pops a wheelie and RAMS Anders over the edge. 
The bike tumbles and PANCAKES into the pavement. Anders tears through several AWNINGS before slamming into the ground. 
Xander turns and rides to the next apartment building. 
He hops down a steep series of roofs that will eventually take him to street level. 
PETRA I know which cops are good and which are bad. Come with me. Come on, right now. 
She drags him to the door. 
EXT. ST. CHARLES BRIDGE - DAY 
The beautiful and historic St. Charles bridge spans the river. There are BANNERS hanging in celebration of the coming PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE. Petra leads Xander across it. 
XANDER Where are we going? 
PETRA We're getting out of this place. We've done enough. 
XANDER Wait a minute, whoa. We can't go now. What's Yorgi got planned with that nerve agent? 
PETRA It doesn't matter anymore, forget it. 
XANDER Of course it matters. Hey, hold on! 
PETRA What do we owe our governments? Yours kidnapped you, mine abandoned me. 
XANDER Petra, this ain't about the people that sent us here, you know that. 
PETRA No, now it's about us. Let's do something for us before we both get killed. Don't you want to get to Bora Bora, Xander? 
XANDER We can't leave now. We have to do something. 
PETRA Why? You're the one who believes in nothing. Screw the world, or whatever you said. 
Xander grabs her by shoulders. 
XANDER Alright, so I was full of shit. I thought believing in things was wrong. Turns out believing in nothing is worse. You might as well be dead. I'm not thrilled with the world, but I'm not gonna let those idiots start killing people. Come on, you're a cop, we've got to get these guys. 
He's gotten through to her. She nods in agreement. 
PETRA They left. To a fortress in the mountains. 
XANDER We'll have to go after them. 
PETRA Aren't you afraid? 
XANDER A long time ago I learned how to put fear away in a little place in my head. Maybe that's my problem. If you don't feel fear you can do some amazing things, but you can also screw your life up in ways you can't imagine. 
PETRA I must be healthy, then, because I'm scared to death. I guess I'd better get back to Yorgi. 
XANDER You don't have to do that. 
PETRA Yes, I do. You're right. I can't just let him go free. Besides, I can help you from the inside. 
XANDER Aren't they gonna wonder were you've been? 
PETRA (shrugs) I was supposed to wait for the cop to kill you and then kill the cop. They'll believe me. (beat) I've been lying for so long, one more time won't hurt. 
XANDER When this is over, we're just gonna take off, the two of us. Take a vacation. 
PETRA What the hell are we doing? We're doing all this together, trusting each other, making plans, and we haven't even slept together yet. 
Xander kisses her. 
XANDER That gives us something to live for. 
Together they walk back across the bridge. We crane up, revealing the PRAGUE PEACE CONFERENCE banners all over a big BUILDING on the river. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY 
We see a craggy, gnarly mountain. The front side is a rock strewn, near vertical drop. 
Then we see Xander come scaling up from the back side. He's got GEAR strapped to his back and it looks like it's been a helluva climb. 
Xander sits at the very peak and catches his breath. It's beautiful up here. 
He pulls a COLLAPSIBLE SNOWBOARD off his back, hits a switch and the thing SWITCHBLADES OUT to full size. He clamps it on his feet. 
Xander moves to the edge and peers down. At the bottom of the mountain he can see the CASTLE, an imposing medieval fortress in the snow. He leans over the edge and starts down the mountain. He doesn't get far before he notices something else. He slides to a stop on the near vertical face, clinging to rocks for balance. 
On the mountain below him, between him and the castle, is a GUARD OUTPOST. Right now he's in full view and he's been spotted. He sees GUARDS scrambling out, hopping on SNOWMOBILES. From up here they look like ants. 
EXT. GUARD OUTPOST - DAY 
Viktor, the goateed cold weather warrior, strides out of the Outpost and looks up the mountain. He shouts orders to his men. 
A Guard runs up and brings him his weapon: A FLAME-THROWER. 
Viktor straps it on and. climbs onto his SNOWMOBILE. 
All around him the Guards are driving into position. They form a gauntlet of AK-47's. There must be a DOZEN of them. 
Viktor rides up twenty yards and waits, his engine idling. 
Just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface. 
We see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making this impossible climb. 
At the top is an overhang. It's a gnarly transition. As he's rounding it, his FEET SLIP. His legs dangle over the rocky chasm below. 
Using all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the way with his climbing claws. 
At the top a GUARD leans over, aiming his gun at him. Xander grabs him and pulls him over the edge. 
The Guard FALLS into the chasm. 
Xander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted. Then another GUARD rushes him, grabbing for his rifle. 
Xander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun from his hands. With the other hand he SLASHES, taking the Guard down. 
He pulls off the claws and heads into the Guard Tower. 
INT. CASTLE - COURTYARD - DAY 
Xander exits the Guard Tower at the ground level. 
As he crosses the courtyard an EXPLOSION rocks the tower he just left. 
There is shouting as GUARDS race around the parapets, unsure where the attack is coming from. A GUARD runs up to Xander. 
GUARD (in Russian) What's going on? 
Xander CLOTHESLINES him and catches his AK-47 as he drops. 
Up inside the castle he can see Yorgi at a window. Yorgi appears mildly shocked as they make EYE CONTACT. 
Xander takes aim. 
POV ON XANDER THRU SNIPER SCOPE 
From up above, Kirill has Xander in his sights. 
BLAW! The bullet hits Xander's AK, sending it spinning. 
Xander rubs his sore hand but stays put. Kirill could have killed him and he knows it. From a doorway comes Yorgi with some Guards. 
Yorgi walks up and SMASHES Xander in the face. 
YORGI That was for Anders. 
XANDER Don't forget goatee boy. I greased him up on the diamond run. 
Yorgi punches him again. 
INT. CASTLE - MAIN BUILDING - DAY 
Petra sits at a desk working on a LAPTOP. Yorgi enters with Xander and Kirill. 
YORGI Look who we found playing outside. 
Petra looks up. She can barely hide her shock. 
YORGI Petra, my sweet dove, do you notice anything strange about X? He looks slightly less than dead. 
Kirill aims his gun at Petra. 
PETRA Yorgi, I thought he was -- 
Yorgi SLAPS her. 
YORGI Do you think I didn't know about you all along? My contacts in the KGB told me you were coming. You show up undercover and, I must admit, you play your part to the hilt. When it's time to be cruel, you are cruel. When it's time to be passionate, you are very very passionate indeed. 
Petra is devastated by this revelation. 
YORGI I could have killed you, but I thought this would be so much more fun. To twist you and use you how I see fit. And to be honest, you went much farther than I ever expected you would for your country. 
He runs this fingers through her hair and moves on to Xander. 
YORGI And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much? 
XANDER I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls. 
YORGI Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is. 
PETRA The Peace conference... 
YORGI Nice place to start, don't you think? 
XANDER What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche. 
YORGI You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves. 
XANDER How's Ivan? 
IVAN 2 He is okay. 
XANDER Thanks for coming, man, you guys were right on time. 
IVAN 2 We are always on time. Two have escaped, in truck. 
PETRA Yorgi and Kirill. 
XANDER Let me guess, they had a big white torpedo with them. 
IVAN 2 Yes. Your friend, the angry one, he send something for you. 
EXT. CASTLE - DAY 
A big truck pulls to a stop. Its ramp lowers and Xander's blown-out '72 GTO comes rolling out. 
IVAN 2 We'll be right behind you. 
Xander and Petra both strap on grenades and pistols. 
XANDER Did you do your homework? 
PETRA (nods) If they launch it, I know how to bring it back. 
XANDER Let's do this. 
They both climb in and the GTO peels out. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY 
Xander drives all out, trying hard to catch up. 
He passes several of Ivan's Police Jeeps at a furious clip. 
Up ahead they see the truck winding it's way down the mountain. 
XANDER Where's he headed? 
PETRA He owns a big industrial complex on the river. He'll launch it from there. 
Xander floors it. 
Up ahead, in the flatbed truck, Yorgi drives. He can see the GTO gaining on them. 
YORGI (in Russian, subtitled) They're coming! Get back there. 
Kirill loads his sniper rifle and climbs out of the cab. He lays down, resting the rifle on the Ahab container. 
As the GTO comes into view, he sights up and FIRES, WHACK! The first shot goes clean through the windshield and blows the headrest off Xander's seat. 
XANDER You get down! I'll take care of this fool! 
He pulls out an Mp-5 out and hangs it out the window. 
PETRA No! Don't shoot! He's hiding behind the nerve agent! 
Another shot blasts through, taking off the rear-view mirror. 
XANDER Goddamit! He's gonna stop playing around soon and shoot something valuable! 
Kirill laughs and takes aim once again. He puts Petra in the sights. 
Xander jerks the steering wheel and BLAM! the shot goes wide. 
The GTO veers onto a dirt road that cuts down the mountain. 
Xander fights for control as they slide around the turns. 
The road flattens out and they can see the Industrial Complex up ahead. They cut across a field, heading right for it. 
EXT. OUTSIDE THE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - DAY 
The truck heads through the gates of the industrial complex. 
Quickly the gates are closed again. Armed GUARDS can be seen up above. 
The GTO comes at the gates at full speed. 
XANDER Let's see what my man put together. 
Xander opens a DASH PANEL, revealing a ROW OF SWITCHES. He flips one. 
The HEADLIGHTS EJECT, revealing a MINI-GUN IN EACH FENDER. 
BRRRAAAAAAPPP!! The mini-guns spin.

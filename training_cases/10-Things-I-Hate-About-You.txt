Revision November 12, 1997 
PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY 
Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep out of their eyes and head for the main building. 
PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY 
KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, baby blue '75 Dodge Dart. 
A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack. 
The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees who his board has hit. 
RIDER Hey -- sorry. 
Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered belongings. 
KAT Leave it 
He persists. 
KAT (continuing) I said, leave it! 
She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, entering school. 
INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY 
BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her. 
BIANCA Did you change your hair? 
CHASTITY No. 
BIANCA You might wanna think about it 
Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway. 
HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS 
Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both boys and girls alike. 
BOY (adoring) Hey, Bianca. 
GIRL Awesome shoes. 
The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, acknowledging her fans. 
GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery guidance counselor. 
MISS PERKY I'm sure you won't find Padua any different than your old school.  Same little asswipe mother-fuckers everywhere. 
Her plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in his chair uncomfortably. 
MISS PERKY (continuing) Any questions? 
CAMERON I don't think so, ma'am 
MISS PERKY Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got deviants to see. 
Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms Perky's door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he is. 
Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick 
MISS PERKY (continuing) Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our visits a weekly ritual. 
She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming smile. 
PATRICK I missed you. 
MISS PERKY It says here you exposed yourself to a group of freshmen girls. 
PATRICK It was a bratwurst.  I was eating lunch. 
MISS PERKY With the teeth of your zipper? 
She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game show host. 
MICHAEL You the new guy? 
MICHAEL Joey Dorsey?  Perma-shit-grin.  I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class.  And a model.  Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out. 
The BELL rings, and the cowboys stand and spit into their empty bean cans.   Cameron and Michael rise as Cameron tries to catch a glimpse of Bianca as she walks back inside. 
MICHAEL (continuing) You know French? 
CAMERON Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada 
MICHAEL Guess who just signed up for a tutor? 
CAMERON You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her? 
MICHAEL You could consecrate with her, my friend. 
Cameron watches as Bianca flounces back into the building. 
EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - DAY 
Kat and Mandella walk toward Kat's car.  Joey pulls up beside her in his Viper. 
JOEY (re her dress) The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy? 
KAT Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break. 
JOEY (practically spitting) They're running the rest of me next month. 
He zooms away as Kat yanks open the door of her Dart. Mandella ties a silk scarf around her head, as if they're in a convertible. 
KAT The people at this school are so incredibly foul. 
MANDELLA You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends. 
They watch Joey's car as he slows next to Bianca and Chastity as they walk toward the school bus. 
ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY 
JOEY Need a ride, ladies? 
Bianca and Chastity can't get in Joey's car fast enough.  He pulls away with a smile. 
BACK TO KAT AND MANDELLA 
Mandella lowers her sunglasses to watch. 
MANDELLA That's a charming new development 
Kat doesn't answer, but reaches over and puts a tape in the tape deck.  The sounds of JOYFUL PUNK ROCK fill the car. 
As they pull out, Michael crosses in front of them on his moped. Kat has to SLAM the brakes to keep from hitting him 
KAT (yelling) Remove head from sphincter!  Then pedal! 
Michael begins fearfully, pedaling as Kat PEELS out, angry at the delay. 
Cameron rushes over 
CAMERON You all right? 
He slows to a stop 
MICHAEL Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew. 
CAMERON That's her?  Bianca's sister? 
MICHAEL The mewling, rampalian wretch herself. 
Michael putters off, leaving Cameron dodging Patrick's grimy, grey Jeep -- a vehicle several years and many paint jobs away from its former glory as a REGULATION MAIL TRUCK - - as he sideswipes several cars on his way out of the lot. 
INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE - DAY 
SHARON STRATFORD, attractive and focused, sits in front of her computer, typing quickly.   A shelf next to her holds several bodice-ripper romance novels, bearing her name. 
Kat stands behind her, reading over her shoulder as she types. 
KAT "Undulating with desire, Adrienne removes her crimson cape, revealing her creamy --" 
WALTER STRATFORD, a blustery, mad scientist-type obstetrician, enters through the front door, wearing a doctor's white jacket and carrying his black bag. 
WALTER 
I hope dinner's ready because I only have ten minutes before Mrs. Johnson squirts out a screamer. 
He grabs the mail and rifles through it, as he bends down to kiss Sharon on the cheek. 
SHARON In the microwave. 
WALTER (to Kat) Make anyone cry today? 
KAT Sadly, no.  But it's only four-thirty. 
CAMERON (looking down) Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine.  Saturday?  Night? 
Bianca smiles slowly 
BIANCA You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again? 
CAMERON (embarrassed) Forget it. 
Bianca seizes an opportunity. 
BIANCA No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction --- 
CAMERON Cameron. 
BIANCA The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does. 
CAMERON Seems like she could get a date easy enough... 
She fingers a lock of her hair.  He looks on, dazzled. 
BIANCA 
The problem is, she's completely anti-social. 
CAMERON Why? 
BIANCA Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something. 
CAMERON That's a shame. 
She reaches out and touches his arm 
BIANCA Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend... 
CAMERON Let me see what I can do. 
Cameron smiles, having no idea how stupid he is 
INT. BIOLOGY CLASS 
A frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks. Michael and Cameron go for the spleen. 
MICHAEL You're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl?  Do you have no concept of the high school social code? 
Cameron grins away 
CAMERON I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me. 
MICHAEL Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you.  So what's the point? 
Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab tables away.  He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles as he tries to revive his frog. 
CAMERON What about him? 
MICHAEL (confused) You wanna go out with him? 
The others at the lab table raise their eyebrows 
CAMERON (impatient) No - he could wrangle with the sister. 
Michael smiles.  Liking the intrigue. 
MICHAEL What makes you think he'll do it? 
CAMERON He seems like he thrives on danger 
MICHAEL No kidding.  He's a criminal.  I heard he lit a state trooper on fire.  He just got out of Alcatraz... 
CAMERON They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology? 
MICHAEL I'm serious, man, he's whacked.  He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers. 
CAMERON Forget his reputation.  Do you think we've got a plan or not? 
MICHAEL Did she actually say she'd go out with you? 
CAMERON That's what I just said 
Michael processes this. 
MICHAEL You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set.  You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list.  With me by your side. 
CAMERON I thought you hated those people. 
MICHAEL Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street. 
A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee Kid's latte.  Cameron presses on, over the melee. 
CAMERON So now all we gotta do is talk to him. 
Michael pulls back, noticing other guys filing in. 
MICHAEL 
Hey - I appreciate gratitude as much as the next guy, but it's not gonna do you any good to be known as New Kid Who Embraces Guys In The Bathroom. 
Cameron pulls back and attempts to posture himself in a manly way for the others, now watching. 
INT. KENNY'S THAI FOOD DINER - DAY 
Kat and Mandella pick apart their pad thai.  Mandella is smoking. 
KAT So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all. 
MANDELLA William would never have gone to a state school. 
KAT William didn't even go to high school 
MANDELLA That's never been proven 
KAT Neither has his heterosexuality. 
Mandella replies with a look of ice.  Kat uses the moment to stub out Mandella's cigarette. 
KAT (continuing) I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming. (pointing at her food) Do you mind? 
MANDELLA Does it matter? 
KAT If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara." 
They both look up as Patrick enters.  He walks up to the counter to place his order. 
Mandella leans toward Kat with the glow of fresh gossip 
MANDELLA Janice Parker told me he was a roadie for Marilyn Manson. 
Patrick nods at them as he takes his food outside. 
KAT Janice Parker is an idiot 
INT.  MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Patrick sits before Miss Perky, eating his Thai food 
MISS PERKY (looking at chart) I don't understand, Patrick.  You haven't done anything asinine this week. Are you not feeling well? 
PATRICK Touch of the flu. 
MISS PERKY I'm at a loss, then.  What should we talk about? Your year of absence? 
He smiles his charming smile 
PATRICK How 'bout your sex life? 
She tolerates his comment with her withering glance. 
MISS PERKY Why don't we discuss your driving need to be a hemorrhoid? 
PATRICK What's to discuss? 
MISS PERKY You weren't abused, you aren't stupid, and as far as I can tell, you're only slightly psychotic -- so why is it that you're such a fuck-up? 
PATRICK Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good... 
The bell RINGS. 
MISS PERKY Fine.  Go do something repugnant and give us something to talk about next week. 
INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY 
Several pairs of tutors and students sit at the various desks. 
Mandella sits with TREVOR, a White Rasta.  She attempts to get him to do geometry, but he stares at her, as if smitten 
MANDELLA Look, it's really easy. 
TREVOR You're a freedom fighter. Be proud, sister. 
Mandella sets down her pencil and closes the book. 
MANDELLA (rotely) It's Mandella with two L's.  I am not related to Nelson Mandela.  I am not a political figure.  I do not live in South Africa.  My parents just spent a few too many acid trips thinking they were revolutionaries. 
TREVOR But you freed our people 
MANDELLA Your "people" are white, suburban high school boys who smoke too much hemp.  I have not freed you, Trevor. (grabbing his arm dramatically) Only you can free yourself. 
ACROSS THE ROOM Bianca and Cameron sit side by side, cozy as can be 
BIANCA C'esc ma tete. This is my head 
Patrick raises an eyebrow, urging him up 
JOEY (continuing) Take it or leave it.  This isn't a negotiation. 
PATRICK Fifty, and you've got your man. 
Patrick walks away with a smile 
EXT. FIELD HOCKEY FIELD - DAY 
Kat and the rest of the team go through a grueling practice session.  Kat spares no one as she whips the ball all over the field. 
Patrick sits on the bleachers nearby, watching.  A cigarette dangles from his mouth.  His pal, SCURVY is next to him. 
MR. CHAPIN, the coach, blows the WHISTLE. 
MR. CHAPIN (proudly) Good run, Stratford. 
Kat nods in response, and the girls leave the field. Patrick hops down to follow. 
PATRICK Hey. Girlie. 
Kat stops and turns slowly to look at him. 
PATRICK (continuing) I mean Wo-man.  How ya doin'? 
KAT (smiles brightly) Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself? 
PATRICK There's a way to get a guy's attention. 
KAT My mission in life. 
She stands there undaunted, hand on hip. 
KAT (continuing) Obviously, I've struck your fancy. So, you see, it worked.  The world makes sense again. 
Patrick's eyes narrow.  He steps closer. 
PATRICK Pick you up Friday, then 
KAT Oh, right.  Friday. 
PATRICK backs up a little.  He uses his most seductive tone 
PATRICK The night I take you to places you've never been before.  And back. 
KAT Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy? 
PATRICK I know a lot more than that 
Kat stares at him. 
KAT Doubtful.  Very doubtful. 
She walks away quickly, leaving him standing alone. 
PATRICK (calling after her) You're no bargain either, sweetheart. 
Scurvy appears at his side 
SCURVY So I guess the Jeep won't be getting a new Blaupunkt. 
ACROSS THE FIELD Cameron and Michael watch. 
MICHAEL He took the bait. 
STRATFORD HOUSE/BATHROOM - NIGHT 
Kat washes her face at the sink.  Bianca appears behind her, and attempts to twist Kat's hair into a chignon. 
She wacks Bianca away. 
BIANCA Have you ever considered a new look? I mean, seriously, you could have some potential buried under all this hostility. 
Kat pushes past her into the hallway. 
KAT I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way. 
BIANCA Can you at least start wearing a bra? 
Kat SLAMS her door in response. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Patrick, Scurvy and some other randoms head for the exit 
SCURVY You up for a burger? 
Patrick looks in his wallet.  It's empty. 
WALTER Christ!  I want a night to go by that I'm not staring a contraction in the face. 
He walks out, leaving Kat stewing on the couch. 
INT. HALLWAY - DAY 
Patrick shuts his graffiti-encrusted locker, revealing Joey's angry visage, glowering next to him. 
JOEY When I shell out fifty, I expect results. 
PATRICK I'm on it 
JOEY Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date. 
PATRICK I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image. 
Joey sees through the bluff 
JOEY Let me put it to you this way, if you don't get any action, I don't get any action.  So get your ass on hers by the end of the week. 
Joey starts to walk off 
PATRICK I just upped my price 
JOEY (turning) What? 
PATRICK A hundred bucks a date. 
JOEY Forget it. 
PATRICK Forget her sister, then. 
Joey thinks for a frustrated moment, PUNCHES  the locker, then peels another fifty out of his wallet with a  menacing scowl. 
JOEY You better hope you're as smooth as you think you are, Verona. 
Patrick takes the money with a smile. 
INT. TUTORING ROOM - DAY Cameron runs a sentence past Bianca. 
CAMERON La copine et I 'ami?  La diferance? 
Bianca glares at him. 
BIANCA A "copine" is someone you can count on. An "ami" is someone who makes promises he can't keep. 
Cameron closes the French book 
CAMERON You got something on your mind? 
BIANCA I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date? 
He melts 
CAMERON You have my word.  As a gentleman 
BIANCA You're sweet. 
She touches his hand. He blushes at her praise and watches her toss her hair back 
CAMERON (appreciative) How do you get your hair to look like that? 
BIANCA Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment. 
Cameron nods with interest. 
CAMERON You know, I read an article about that. 
Bianca looks surprised. 
BIANCA You did? 
INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY 
Patrick stands at the sink, washing his hands Michael and Cameron cower in the corner, watching him. 
PATRICK (without turning around) Say it 
MICHAEL (clearing his throat) What? 
PATRICK Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say. 
Cameron bravely steps forward 
CAMERON We wanted to talk to you about the plan. 
Patrick turns toward them. 
PATRICK What plan? 
JOEY Good, 'cause I'm not gonna bother if you won't be there. 
He taps her on the nose and she giggles 
INT. TUTORING ROOM Bianca sits across from Cameron, who's transfixed, as always 
BIANCA Have you heard about Bogey Lowenstein's party? 
CAMERON Sure have. 
BIANCA (pouting) I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes. 
CAMERON I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him. 
He fishes. 
CAMERON (continuing) She's not a... 
BIANCA Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies. 
CAMERON So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones? 
BIANCA Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes. 
Cameron furiously takes notes 
CAMERON All right.  What else is she partial to? 
INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT Patrick plays pool with some random deviant cronies. 
He looks up when he hears a COMMOTION at the door.  LOU the bouncer is in the midst of throwing Michael and Cameron out. 
PATRICK Lou, it's okay.  They're with me. 
Lou looks at Patrick, surprised, then reluctantly lets our two non-deviants pass through. 
Patrick guides them to a table and sips from a beer. 
PATRICK (continuing) What've you got for me? 
CAMERON I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful. 
Cameron pulls out a piece of paper. 
MICHAEL (to Patrick) 
One question before we start -- should you be drinking alcohol when you don't have a liver? 
PATRICK What?! 
MICHAEL Good enough. 
Cameron looks up at Patrick. 
CAMERON Number one.  She hates smokers 
MICHAEL It's a lung cancer issue 
CAMERON Her favorite uncle 
MICHAEL Dead at forty-one. 
Patrick sits up 
PATRICK Are you telling me I'm a - (spits the word out) "non-smoker"? 
MICHAEL Just for now. 
CAMERON Another thing.  Bianca said that Kat likes -- pretty guys. 
This is met with silence.  Then: 
PATRICK What?  You don't think I'm pretty? 
Michael smacks Cameron 
MICHAEL He's pretty! 
CAMERON Okay!  I wasn't sure 
Cameron goes back to the list. 
CAMERON (continuing) Okay -- Likes:  Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion". 
PATRICK So what does that give me?  I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments? 
MICHAEL Ever been to Club Skunk? 
PATRICK Yeah. 
INT. CLUB FOYER - NIGHT 
Patrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked PIERCED EYEBROW BOY.  Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the boy's inside pocket. 
BRUCE Next time, leave the Bic at home, Skippy. 
SKIPPY It's a bottle opener. 
Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick. 
BRUCE Verona, my man. 
They shake. 
PATRICK Always a pleasure, Brucie. 
BRUCE Didn't have you pegged for a Gigglepuss fan.  Aren't they a little too pre-teen belly-button ring for you? 
PATRICK Fan of a fan.  You see a couple of minors come in? 
BRUCE Never 
PATRICK Padua girls.  One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed? 
BRUCE Just sent 'em through. 
Patrick starts to go in 
BRUCE (continuing) Hey -- what happened to that chick you brought last time?  The one with the snake? 
Patrick laughs and goes into the club 
INT. CLUB - NIGHT 
Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their bad girl sass into a ripping punk number. 
Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR 
Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss finishes a song. 
LEAD SINGER Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and we're from Olympia. 
A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to scream. 
BOY (0.S.) Pet my kitty! 
LEAD SINGER Meow 
They rev into their next song. 
NEAR THE STAGE 
Mandella and Kat glow with sweat.  When they hear the opening chords of the song, they look at each other and scream with glee as they begin to dance.  They couldn't be having a better time. 
AT THE BAR 
Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks across the bouncing surge of the crowd.  He spots Kat and Mandella singing along. 
HIS POV 
The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. None of her usual "attitude".  Patrick is transfixed.  And most definitely attracted. 
NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella. 
KAT (shouting) I need agua! 
She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR 
She made it.  She signals for the bartender and as she's waiting, looks around.  She spots Patrick a few feet away 
KAT (continuing to herself) Shit 
She sneaks a glance.  He's staring, but this time he looks away before she can.  Despite herself, she's miffed. 
The bartender arrives 
BARTENDER (shouting) What can I get you? 
KAT Two waters. 
She looks at Patrick again.  He's completely absorbed in the band.  She scowls.  The bottled water arrives and she marches off, forgetting to pay. 
She walks up to Patrick. 
KAT (continuing) You're not fooling anyone. 
Patrick looks at her, surprised 
PATRICK (yelling) hey.  Great show, huh? 
Cameron looks At Michael expectantly 
MICHAEL You told me that part already. 
CAMERON Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and - 
Joey appears over Cameron's shoulder. 
JOEY Hey.  Dingo Boingo 
Cameron and Michael look at each other And turn around slowly 
JOEY (continuing; to Michael) I hear you're helpin' Verona. 
MICHAEL Uh,  yeah.  We're old friend* 
JOEY You and Verona? 
MICHAEL What?  We took bathes together when we were kids. 
It's incredibly obvious that he's lying.  Joey eyes him then turns to Cameron. 
JOEY What's your gig in all this? 
CAMERON I'm just the new guy. 
Joey turns back to Michael, grabbing the alligator on his shirt and twisting it. 
JOEY You better not fuck this up.  I'm heavily invested. 
MICHAEL Hey -- it's all for the higher good right? 
Joey lets go of Michael and SHOVES Cameron against a locker for good measure, as he walks away- 
CAMERON Is it about me? 
EXT. MISS PERKY'S OFFICE - DAY 
Kat sits outside waiting for her appointment, bored and annoyed. 
The door opens and Miss Perky escorts Patrick out 
MISS PERKY You're completely demented. 
PATRICK (cheery) See you next week! 
Kat stands and Patrick sees her. 
Miss Perky watches in horror 
MISS PERKY You two know each other? 
PATRICK/KAT Yeah/No. 
Miss Perky grabs Kat and shoves her into her office. 
MISS PERKY (to Patrick) Dear God, stay away from her.  If you two ever decided to breed, evil would truly walk the earth. 
Patrick gives Kat one last look before the door shuts, then smiles- 
EXT. STRATFORD HOUSE - NIGHT 
The lights are on, illuminating the yard 
INT.  STRATFORD HOUSE/UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Bianca and Chastity stand outside Kat's room.  MUSIC is blaring and the door is shut.  Bianca looks at her watch 
BIANCA She's obviously not going. 
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Across the carpet, two pairs of teenage girl feet sneak past.  Bianca and Chastity, teddy bear purses in hand. 
FROM THE KITCHEN A RUSTLING is heard.  The girls freeze. 
Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich The girls are like statues.  Walter jumps. 
BIANCA Daddy, I -- 
WALTER And where're you going? 
BIANCA If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends. 
WALTER Otherwise known as an orgy? 
BIANCA It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going -- 
She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis.  Her relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at- school look.  She wanders toward the kitchen. 
BOGEY, a short Future MBA in a tux, greets his guests like a pro, handing out cigars and martinis. 
BOGEY Nice to see you.  Martini bar to the right, shots in the kitchen. 
The house is filled to capacity with Padua High's finest Kat pushes through the crowd.  Patrick saunters in behind her 
INT. BOGEY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Joey lines up a row of shots amid much whooping and hollering within the jock crowd. 
Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face.  Joey sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the doorway. 
JOEY Lookin' fresh tonight, Pussy-Kat 
Kat gives him a death look and then stops and points at his forehead. 
KAT Wait -- was that?-- Did your hairline just recede? 
He panics, whipping out a handy pocket mirror   She's already walking away. 
JOEY Where ya goin? 
KAT Away. 
JOEY Your sister here? 
Kat's face shows utter hatred 
KAT Leave my sister alone. 
JOEY (smirking) And why would I do that? 
A RUCKUS sounds from the next room 
JOCK A fight! 
The other jocks rush to watch as two Coffee Kids splash their cupfuls on each other. 
COFFEE KID #1 That was a New Guinea Peaberry, you Folger's-crystals-slurping-buttwipe. 
Caffeinated fists fly.  Joey slithers away from the door to watch, giving Kat one last smirk, just as Bianca walks into the kitchen. 
JOEY Just who I was looking for. 
He puts his arm around Bianca and escorts her out 
KAT BIANCA 
Bianca keeps walking, ignoring Kat 
A GUY pouring shots hands Kat one She downs it and accepts another. 
GUY Drink up, sister. 
Patrick walks up 
PATRICK What's this? 
KAT (mocking) "I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party? 
PATRICK I say, do what you wanna do. 
KAT Funny, you're the only one 
She downs another. 
INT. BOGEY'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Cameron and Michael enter.  Cameron looks, around for his beloved, while Michael schmoozee with all in attendance and dishes dirt simultaneously. 
MICHAEL (high-fiving a jock) Moose, my man! (to Cameron) Ranked fifth in the state. Recruiters have already started calling. 
Cameron nods intently 
MICHAEL (continuing; grabbing his belt) Yo, Clem. (to Cameron) A Patsy Cline fan, but hates the new Leanne Rimes. (with a Jamaican swagger) Ziggy, peace, bra. (to Cameron) Prefers a water pipe, but has been known to use a bong. 
Michael spots Bianca and Chastity, watching the skirmish, and points Cameron's body in her direction. 
MICHAEL (continuing) Follow the love, man 
ON BIANCA AND CHASTITY Bianca cranes her neck 
BIANCA Where did he go?  He was just here. 
CHASTITY Who? 
BIANCA Joey. 
Cameron walks over. 
There's a KNOCK at the door.  Bianca opens it to find a very drunken Kat. 
KAT Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you -- 
BIANCA (cutting her off) I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now. 
Bianca grabs Chastity's arm and they exit

A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and starts dancing by herself.  She lets loose, hair flying. She's almost burlesque. 
Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on 
She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot hanging from the rack above the center island.  She starts to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.

PATRICK You're not okay. 
KAT I just need to lie down for awhile 
PATRICK Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep

KAT It's my car. 
He changes it back.

KAT Were you in jail? 
PATRICK Maybe. 
KAT No, you weren't

KAT This. 
She points to the radio 
PATRICK Start a band? 
CLEM (continuing) Okay, now tell me again why he didn't shoot the deputy?

Mrs. Blaise enters and sits at her desk 
MRS. BLAISE Well now, did everyone have a good weekend?

MRS. BLAISE (continuing) Any form you'd like.  Rhyme, no rhyme, whatever.  I'd like to see you elaborate on his theme, however. Let's read it aloud, shall we? Anyone? 
The class is frozen in apathy. 
MRS. BLAISE (continuing) Derek? 
Ms. Blaise hands him the sonnet. He shifts uncomfortably in his seat. Then grins. 
DEREK (reading; in his Rasta stoner drawl) In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes/ For they in thee a thousand errors note/ But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise/ Who in despite of view is pleas 'd to dote. 
In the back of the room Clem raises his hand 
CLEM Ms. Blaise, can I get the bathroom pass?  Damn if Shakespeare don't act as a laxative on my person.

PATRICK I don ' t know. (beat) I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it. 
Michael and Cameron look at each other in realization, then turn back to Patrick. 
CAMERON 
You realize this puts the whole operation in peril. 
PATRICK 
No shit.  She won't even look at me 
CAMERON 
Why can't you just tell her you're sorry?

MICHAEL I'm on it

MICHAEL Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile. 
PATRICK What's the worst? 
CAMERON You get the girl. 
Patrick  thinks for a minute 
PATRICK If I go down. I'm takin' her with me

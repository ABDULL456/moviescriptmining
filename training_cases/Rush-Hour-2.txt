Rush Hour 2 
RUSH HOUR 2 
BY 
Jeff Nathanson 
EXT. HONG KONG SKYLINE - ESTABLISHING 
A smoky haze dims the blazing sun.  Skyscrapers sit like watchtowers over the city, where East meets West for five and a half million people a day. 
EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - HONG KONG - DAY 
THE AMERICAN EMBASSY - U.S. and Chinese flags side by side. 
HU LI, dark glasses, EXITS and slowly moves toward a STREET VENDOR across the street. 
She pays for an order of pork bao; as she takes her first bite we see: 
THE EXPLOSION BEHIND HER 
TWO OFFICES ON THE SIXTH FLOOR BLOWN OUT - a huge fireball erupting over one side of the embassy. 
People panic and run.  Hu Li doesn't even flinch.  She takes a bite of her pork bao as she casually turns to the stunned street vendor. 
HU LI (Chinese, subtitled) Someone better call the police. 
EXT./INT. LEE'S CAR - CONTINUOUS 
The passenger window rolls down and we see Carter, styling in a Chinese-cut suit.  He's holding a Chinese-English dictionary, leaning out the window - giving his best "do me" look to two girls in a convertible. 
CARTER (int Chinese) Deng wa lu yun cai-shen wu. 
The HORRIFIED GIRLS speed off, and Carter turns to Lee, who is driving and singing to his radio. 
LEE (singing) ...wish they all could be California... wish they all could be California girls... 
Carter ejects the BEACH BOYS CD from the stereo and TOSSES it out of the SUNROOF. 
CARTER I warned you about playing that shit when I'm in the car. 
LEE That was my CD.  Don't you ever touch a Chinese man's CD. 
CARTER Did you see the way those girls drove off?  I did you a favor. 
LEE Those girls drove off because of you. 
CARTER All I did was invite them for a drink. 
LEE You invited them to get naked and sacrifice a small goat. 
CARTER (checking Chinese-English dictionary) I said that?  Which word was "goat?" 
Lee picks up his CD case. 
LEE You owe me a copy of the Beach Boys Greatest Hits, Volume Two. 
CARTER Don't be giving me attitude, Lee.  I've been here three days and we haven't done shit.  We haven't been to a club, haven't even talked to a girl.  I'm on vacation, and I want some mu-shu. 
LEE Mu-shu?  You're hungry? 
CARTER Not Mu-shu.  Mu-shu.  I want to see some women.  Now stop playing dumb and show me the shu! 
Carter flips through the dictionary.  A CALL COMES in over LEE'S CELL PHONE. 
INTERCUT 
Lee steps back into shadow -- does a double take as he realizes he's hearing Carter belting out "DON'T STOP 'TILL YOU GET ENOUGH." 
INT. RAVEN CLUB - CONTINUOUS 
A room full of Chinese sitting with their mouths open, watching Carter on the Karaoke stage doing a dead-on Michael Jackson, singing his heart out.  Dancing and making eyes at a few of the smitten women who are watching him. 
LEE (whispering from side of stage) Carter, get off that stage! 
CARTER Are you kidding, they love me.  I'm a star, Lee.  A god to these people! 
Carter resumes singing, really getting down.  Moonwalking to the EDGE of the STATE where Lee PULLS HIM OFF. 
LEE This is a gangster bar, we're here undercover. 
CARTER I knew you were lying. 
LEE I'm sorry. 
CARTER Damn it, why are you ruining my night? I'm just starting to have fun. (beat) Well fine then, go ahead, pull your badge and do your thing. 
LEE No, we're here for information, to find out where a man named Ricky Tan is.  We must tread softly and keep our ears open. 
CARTER Tread softly?  Who taught you how to roost a bar? 
LEE Carter, you don't understand.  These men are Fu-Cang-Long Triads.  Part of the most deadly gang in China. 
CARTER Man, are you crazy?  You think that scares me?  I'm from  L.A.  We invented gangs.  We were having gang wars before anybody even thought about it.  We get royalties from other gangs.  Now gimme your badge and gun and I'll show you how it's done. 
LEE No.  You are a civilian.  In China, I am Michael Jackson, and you are Toto. 
CARTER You mean Tito.  We had  Toto for dinner last night. 
Before Lee can react, Carter has lifted Lee's badge and gun. Carter bounds back on stage, pulls the plug on the music and fires three SHOTS into the ceiling, silencing the bar. 
CARTER (CONT'D) (Chinese) Deng wa lu yun, shen wu wattu masu wang lui. 
Nobody moves.  Strange looks from the crowd.  Carter turns to Lee. 
CARTER (CONT'D) (whispering) What'd I say? 
LEE You just said you're their worst nightmare - and to line their mothers up for a milking. 
CARTER Shit.  C'mon, get up here and help me out. 
Reluctantly, Lee gets on stage.  More looks from the Chinese as Carter speaks, Lee translating. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Okay, all the Triads and ugly women go to that side, all fine ass women on this side. 
Nobody moves.  Carter fires two more shots in the ceiling. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Let's try this again.  Who here knows Ricky Tan, raise your hand. 
Nobody moves. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Who here is named Lee?  Raise your hand. 
Nobody moves. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Now I know you're lying. 
The crowd still hasn't moved.  Except in the back, where Lee spots several GANGSTERS leaving.  As Lee runs off stage -- 
CARTER (CONT'D) (as they run out) I come back and catch y'all singing Michael Jackson and you're all going to jail. 
EXT. RAVEN CLUB - NIGHT 
Lee and Carter run into the street, just in time to see HU LI and several gangsters round a corner. 
Carter and Lee drive through Hong Kong, the two men riding in silence, bruised and covered in garbage. 
CARTER You lied to me. 
LEE I'm sorry. 
CARTER You're sorry.  I got somebody's old chopsticks stuck in my ass, so don't tell me you're sorry.  Just take me home. 
LEE No time.  There was an explosion at the American Embassy today -- two American translators were killed. 
Carter takes this in.  Can't believe his own bad luck. 
CARTER So that Ricky Tan, he's the one who blew up the Embassy? 
EXT. MONASTERY SCHOOL - EARLY MORNING 
Lee and Carter walk into a massive COURTYARD, where thirty 12 year olds are going through their warm up routines. 
MASTER FU, 60's, wears a BLACK ROBE as he teaches his kids. 
CARTER I'm telling you right now, I'm tired of this shit.  There's two billion Chinese - let one of them be your partner. 
LEE This won't take long. 
Master Fu barks out a barrage of SHAOLIN FIGHTING STANCES. 
MASTER FU Dragon kick! 
Like well-trained army, the students YELL AND KICK HARD. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D) Lotus block! 
The students YELL and form an "X" with their arms.  Master Fu notices Carter and Lee watching from the back. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D) Twisting Tiger! 
No response.  The students exchange baffled looks. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D (CONT'D) (staring straight at Lee) Twisting Tiger! 
Lee may be a big rusty, but he puts on a shit-kicking move that leaves the students blown away.  Lee smiles, basking in the glow... 
...until he sees Master Fu's disappointment. 
MASTER FU (CONT'D) Didn't I teach you to always arch your back? 
LEE (bowing, humbled) Yes, Master. 
While Lee follows Master Fu, Carter stands in front of the 12 YEAR OLDS, who sit motionless around a fighting circle. 
Carter starts stretching his legs, warming up. 
CARTER I was watching you kids.  My name is Carter, LAPD, and I'm a third degree black belt.  At least that's what I tell the girls at the Holiday Health Spa where I work out. 
Carter throws a series of QUICK PUNCHES, but the kids have no reaction. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Let me give you kids some tips.  The key to Kung Fu is the follow through.  Why don't you stand up. 
THE KIDS DON'T MOVE, no reaction.  Carter continues to throw punches. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Go ahead, kick me, hit me.  I'll show you how to block.  Come on, stand up, give me your best shot -- try to kick right to my head. 
The kids still don't move.  Carter, working up a sweat from shadow fighting, takes off his JACKET, DRAPING IT over the HOLY BUDDHA behind him -- a mistake.  He swings back around to face the kids and NEVER SEES THE KICK that sends him flying back onto the mat.  He looks around and sees ALL of the kids STANDING, in FIGHTING POSITION. 
CARTER (CONT'D) That's pretty good.  Which one of you kids did that? 
INT. COURTYARD PATHWAY - CONTINUOUS 
CARTER How you doin'? 
LEE My friend is on vacation, from America. I want to show him a good time. 
HOSTESS Oh, you American? 
CARTER That's right. 
HOSTESS You bring American money? 
CARTER (holding up a Platinum AmEx) Never leave home without it. (to Lee) Lee, this one's on me.  You save your money. 
The Hostess takes Carter by the arm, walks over to a HIDDEN SLIDING DOOR - slides it open to reveal TWENTY BEAUTIFUL WOMEN.  Carter truly is in Heaven. 
HOSTESS You get massage from Chinese girl before? 
CARTER No.  It's my first time. 
HOSTESS You pick any girl for you and your friend. 
Carter looks like a kid in a candy store. 
CARTER Any girl?  Okay.  Let's start with that one. 
HOSTESS Oh yes, she's very nice. 
CARTER She is nice.  But I am very tense.  I'm gonna need a lot of massages.  I'll take that one, too.  How you doin', baby? And...that one in pink.  She can do my feet. 
Lee elbows Carter. 
LEE What are you doing? 
CARTER She said I could pick any girl I want. 
LEE Well, hurry up. 
CARTER Hey!  You don't break in front of a black man in a buffet line. 
HOSTESS (to Lee) Your friend have big appetite. (handing ROBES to Lee and Carter) Please put these on and wait upstairs in the quiet room. 
INT. QUIET ROOM MASSAGE PARLOR - DAY 
TWENTY MEN in SILK ROBES lie in reclining chairs, women massaging their feet and hands.  There are BIG SCREEN TV's showing nature films, relaxation music playing in the background. 
Lee and Carter sit in the quiet room dressed in MATCHING PURPLE ROBES.  Lee wears SLIPPERS, Carter wears his HIGH TOPS.  Carter is enjoying a hand and neck massage at the same time.  A WOMAN walks over and hands them each a drink. 
CARTER Now I'm on vacation.  I knew you'd come through, Lee. 
LEE doesn't respond.  LEE IS STARING AT SOMEONE ON THE FAR SIDE OF THE ROOM.  A man who radiates a unique blend of sophistication and brutality. 
CARTER (CONT'D) What's wrong? 
LEE Over there -- that's Ricky Tan. 
CARTER That's Ricky Tan?  He's four feet tall. I'll go over with you right now, shake him down. 
LEE This is a very dangerous man. 
CARTER I'm a dangerous man.  You're not gonna ruin my massage because of some midget in a house coat. 
LEE I'm calling for back up! 
Lee gets up from a chair, hurriedly exits. 
Carter looks at RICKY TAN -- sitting quietly in his chair with his LAPTOP COMPUTER on his knees.  Carter makes a decision, gets up and walks towards him. 
CARTER Ricky Tan, I've been looking all over for you.  Get up. 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN is arguing with SPECIAL AGENT STERLING, a 50-year old hard ass who is in charge of this circus. 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING Chin, you have been ordered by the Ministry of Public Security to assist the FBI and Secret Service with our investigation, to provide us with whatever we need.  If you have information, it belongs to us. 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN This is still Hong Kong. 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING Two Americans have been killed on United States Government property -- this is our investigation. 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN Chief Inspector Lee will brief your people... 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING No.  He will report to me.  Do we understand each other? 
SUDDENLY ALL EYES turn as Carter and Lee enter the bullpen. Out of breath, still robed: Lee covering himself with a trash can lid, Carter using a red construction cone. 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING (CONT'D) Who the hell is that? 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (humiliated) That is...Chief Inspector Lee.  The detective in charge of our investigation. 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING Put a diaper on him, Chin.  I want to talk to the great Inspector Lee. 
INT. LEE'S OFFICE - DAY 
The shades are down as Lee frantically gets dressed, putting on a suit and fixing his tie. Carter finishes putting on a BLACK CHINESE STYLE SUIT from Lee's closet, then moves for the door. 
LEE Where are you going? 
CARTER Back to Heaven on Earth.  I need my damn passport back.  I'm going home. 
LEE Fine.  Go home.  Who needs you. 
CARTER Why you mad at me?  You needed back-up, so I backed you up.  I was about to take out Ricky Tan and those bodyguards. 
LEE Stop!  I'm sick of your bullshit! 
CARTER My bullshit?  I'm not the one who goes to a karaoke bar filled with gangsters! I'm not the one who goes to massage parlors to bust crime lords! 
LEE It's my job! 
CARTER You're pathetic, man.  When's the last time you had some fun?  When's the last time you took a night off, had a date? 
LEE I have plenty of dates. 
CARTER Really?  When's the last time you had some Mu-shu  Let's hear it, Lee, when was it?  Year of the rat? 
LEE You would never understand my life. You're not Chinese. 
CARTER And you ain't black! 
The two men look at each other for a long BEAT.  Lee quickly walks out, slamming the door behind him, leaving Carter half dressed. 
INT. SUPERINDENDENT CHIN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Lee walks in, sees Sterling sitting at Chin's desk.  Chin stands in the back. 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN Lee, this is Special Agent Sterling from the United States Secret Service. 
LEE The Secret Service?  Why? 
STERLING What I'm about to tell you cannot leave this room.  The men who were killed yesterday were not American translators. They were undercover U.S. customs agents trying to break a Triad smuggling ring. We don't know what they're transporting out of Hong Kong, but whatever it is, it got the agents killed. 
LEE How can we help? 
STERLING Stay the hell out of our way. 
LEE I can get to Ricky Tan. 
STERLING We know all about Tan.  That's why we're leaving him out there as bait.  We think this is a lot bigger than just Ricky Tan and his Fu-Cang-Long Triads. 
MAN You wish to spank my sister with a ping pong paddle? 
CARTER No man, I was just asking... 
MAN Wait here.  I'll go see if she's awake. 
As the man walks into his store, Carter runs off. 
Pause. 
Carter strolls back INTO FRAME, peering into the store to see if it's worth staying... 
INT. HONG KONG POLICE STATION - BULL PEN - DAY 
Lee sits by himself in shock.  Superindendent Chin approaches. 
LEE All he wanted was some mu-shu. 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN Are you okay, Lee? 
Beat. 
LEE I'm sorry, I have to go. 
EXT. HEAVEN ON EARTH MASSAGE PARLOR - AFTERNOON 
Carter finally makes his way to the massage parlor, moving for the FRONT DOOR when he sees RICKY TAN EXIT.  Carter ducks to the side and watches as Ricky climbs into the back of a waiting Daimler. 
The Daimler drives off.  Carter rushes to the middle of the street with a determined look on his face. 
CARTER I'm gonna solve this case myself.  Taxi! 
Carter flags down a CAB, jumps in the back seat. 
INT. TAXI - EVENING 
The CAB DRIVER turns to Carter, who motions to the limo. 
CARTER (loud) Follow that limo. 
The Cab Driver continues to stare at Carter. 
CARTER (CONT'D) You understand what I'm saying?  Follow that car!  Where it goes, you go!  This is a chase -- we are chasing that limo! (beat) We are still parked -- we're not moving! This is the opposite of chasing -- drive the car or I will kill you! 
The driver slowly turns, holding out his hand.  Carter fishes in his pocket hands the cab driver a wad of cash. 
CAB DRIVER Now you speak my language. INT. LEE'S CAR - DAY 
Lee drives, misty-eyed.  RAP MUSIC playing over the stereo. Lee turns it up, slowly moving his head to the music, in tribute to Carter. 
His CELL PHONE rings, he turns down the music. 
INTERCUT -- 
INT. CHIN'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN Lee, we just got a call from the harbor patrol.  Ricky Tan is throwing a little party on his boat tonight.  Victoria harbor.  If you don't want to... 
LEE Did you tell Sterling? 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN Let him find out on his own.  I want the Hong Kong police handling this. 
LEE Thank you. 
Lee hangs up.  A look of intensity.  He CRANKS the RAP MUSIC up, a man on a mission. 
EXT. YACHT - HARBOR - NIGHT 
CARTER That's right.  I'm the owner, the Captain -- you can call me El Capitan. 
ISABELLA El Capitan? 
CARTER I don't want to play games with you, Isabella.  I like you.  I can see myself with you -- in one of those bathrooms over there in about five minutes. 
ISABELLA Well, I'm very tempted.  It's such a beautiful yacht.  What's it called? 
CARTER Called?  What's my ship called? (he has no idea) Well...it's called the S.S. Minnow Johnson. 
ISABELLA The S.S. Minow Johnson.  Funny, the name on the back was "Red Dragon." 
CARTER Red Dragon?  You sure about that? 
ISABELLA I'm sure, because this is my friend's yacht.  And it's his party. 
CARTER Your friend's ship? (looking around) Oh, man.  I must've walked onto the wrong yacht.  I knew there was a reason my keys didn't work. 
STEVEN REIGN (taking seat next to Isabella) Who's your friend? 
ISABELLA Somebody who got on the wrong yacht. 
CARTER Wait a second.  You're Steven Reign? You're big time.  You own all them big hotels.  What are you doing in Hong Kong? 
STEVEN REIGN (ushering away Isabella) I'm just in town for the weekend, taking in the sights. 
ISABELLA Enjoy the party, Mr. Carter. 
Carter nods, waves.  Steven Reign and Isabella walk away. Carter's watching. 
INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Lee makes his way toward a STAIRCASE that is blocked by a BODYGUARD.  He quickly disarms the guard and grabs him by the throat, pushing him against the wall. 
LEE Ricky Tan.  Where is he? 
BODYGUARD #1 Who's asking? 
LEE The Hong Kong Police.  He killed a detective today and he's not getting away with it.  Now where is he? 
CARTER Yeah.  Tell us!  And don't play games or we'll kick your lying ass! 
Lee slowly turns around and looks at Carter, who is standing right behind him. 
LEE Carter? 
CARTER Who died? 
LEE You. 
CARTER Detective Yu?  Never met him. 
LEE Not Yu.  You! 
CARTER Who? 
LEE Do you understand the words that are coming out of my mouth? 
CARTER Nobody understands the words that are coming out of your mouth. 
BODYGUARD #1 Get your hands in the air. 
Lee and Carter turn to see FOUR BODYGUARDS standing in front of them with GUNS in hand. 
BODYGUARD #1 (CONT'D) Ricky Tan is expecting you. INT. RICKY TAN'S YACHT - MAIN CABIN - NIGHT 
It looks like HUGH HEFNER'S BEDROOM complete with ROUND BED and SUNKEN BAR.  Ricky Tan sits in front of a big screen satellite TV screaming at the Lakers.  Hu Li opens the door and the bodyguards lead Lee into the bedroom. 
It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED Hu Li with his leg. 
CARTER All right, get your hands up. 
Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head. 
EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS 
Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and Bodyguard #2. 
INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Carter and Hu Li face off. 
CARTER You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give you a little LAPD ass kickin'. 
Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows. 
INT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS 
Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines. 
LEE Hu Li! 
Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the moving boat. 
Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the stern. EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS 
Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time -- watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat. 
Carter turns his head, sees -- 
-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears back into the shadows. 
EXT. DOCK - NIGHT 
The yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs. Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks. 
Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock. 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation. 
CARTER What "revenge" is he talking about? 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that? 
CARTER Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you -- 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A. 
CARTER Fine with me. 
Sterling walks away disgusted. 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to fully cooperate with the Secret Service. 
Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to approach. 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D) (to police officers) Escort Detective Carter to the airport -- 
LEE I'll take him. 
CARTER Hell no. 
The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat. 
CARTER (CONT'D) (to Lee) Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to you. 
CARTER It sounds impossible -- 
LEE You said -- 
CARTER -- but if somebody gave me the chance to square up my father's death, I'd go to hell to do it. 
Carter turns, walks away without looking back. 
CARTER (CONT'D) You want to figure out why they killed your Daddy, get on the plane. 
LEE Why LA? 
CARTER (still not turning) I guess you're going to have to trust me on this one. INT. 747 PASSENGER COMPARTMENT 
Carter and Lee are getting comfortable among all the other passengers, preparing to take off.  Lee has a moment of doubt. 
LEE I should go back.  Ricky Tan mentioned a boat in Hong Kong Harbor... 
CARTER Lee, let me introduce you to the Carter Theory of Criminal Investigation: Follow the Rich White Man. 
LEE Follow the Rich White Man? 
CARTER Almost, but you've got to say "Rich White Man" all run together like it's one word. 
LEE Follow the RichWhiteMan... 
CARTER Not bad.  Now every crime, somewhere, has a rich white man taking his cut. Every single one.  Now in our case, we know the rich white man is Steven Reign. 
LEE Who? 
CARTER Big hotel billionaire.  He was on Ricky Tan's boat ordering Hu Li around just before Ricky got smoked. 
LEE How do you know he's our man? 
CARTER Because when the shooting started he was way too cool.  See most white people, when there's shooting, they either hide in a toilet or start screaming high pitched like "Aaaahhh!!! Aaaahh!!!! 
LEE You sound like that all the time. 
CARTER Black people keep their cool when the shit goes down. 
LEE Maybe.  But not like Asians.  We never panic. 
CARTER Yeah, what about when Godzilla was coming?  You people were screaming your asses off. 
LEE Just tell me where I can find this Steven Reign. 
CARTER The same place you find all RichWhiteMen. (a tray arrives) Gefilte Fish.  Lox and bagel.  I love this stuff.  Here, try it with a smear. 
BINOCULARS P.O.V. THE REIGN TOWERS HOTEL 
CUT TO REVEAL -- 
Carter standing at a window holding high-powered binoculars. 
Lee standing next to him.  WE ARE: 
INT. CHEAP HOTEL ROOM - DOWNTOWN LA - NIGHT 
Cartons of Chinese food are all over the sleazy, run down hotel room.  The LIGHTS LOW, the curtains open a crack. 
BINOCULARS P.O.V. - THE REIGN HOTEL 
Traveling up the side of the Reign Hotel.  Stopping at the penthouse floor - where we see ISABELLA talking with Steven Reign in a hotel room.  After a BEAT, Reign walks to the door. 
Carter flips the binoculars to Lee, who starts watching. 
CARTER Yeah, that's definitely the woman from Ricky Tan's boat, and she's staying in his suite at his hotel, I told you this would work out.  They still just talking? 
LEE I'm gonna go in the hall and get a bucket of ice.  You want some ice? 
CARTER What's going on? 
Lee stares at Carter, looks dazed. 
LEE She's getting undressed. 
CARTER Gimme the binoculars. 
LEE No.  It's not right. 
CARTER Gimme the binoculars or I will shoot you. 
Lee hands Carter the binoculars, then turns his back as Carter watches to the window. 
LEE What's she doing? 
CARTER Oh, sweet glory hallelujah... 
LEE I don't want to hear this. 
CARTER Skirt just came off.  She's in black bra and panties -- Victoria Secret Spring Catalogue, page 27 -- wait a sec - there's a tattoo on her left thigh... it looks like Snoopy. 
LEE Snoopy?  I love Snoopy. 
CARTER She just took her hair down.  Now she's going for the bra -- the clasp is in front -- she's using both hands. (to Lee) You better get that ice. 
Lee steps in front of Carter, blocking his view. 
LEE That's enough.  We shouldn't be doing this! 
Isabella suddenly drops undressing and walks back to the living room to pick up the PHONE.  We see her clearly now in bra and panties. 
CARTER This is our job.  We took an oath as police officers.  If we don't do this, who will?  Firemen? 
Lee backs off, and Carter steps back to the window.  He sees Isabella hang up the phone. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Wait a sec - what the hell is that between her legs? 
LEE What? 
CARTER She's reaching into her panties -- something is strapped to her leg.  Oh, God...please don't let it be a dick. 
LEE What is it? 
CARTER No, I don't believe this shit -- it's a microphone.  Lee, she's wired... 
CLOSE ON ISABELLA 
As she turns to the window.  A TAPE RECORDER in hand.  She puts the recording device away, walks back into the bedroom and puts on a robe. 
LEE I don't understand? 
CARTER She's walking back towards the door. 
BINOCULARS P.O.V. 
We see Isabella wearing a robe - standing at the door of her hotel room talking with someone. 
CARTER (CONT'D) She opened the door.  Someone is delivering a package. 
BINOCULARS P.O.V. 
Inside the hotel room WE SEE HU LI handing her a package. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Lee...it's the girl who delivered the package to your office.  It's a bomb! 
LEE Roof! 
EXT. REIGN TOWERS HOTEL - ROOF - NIGHT 
Lee and Carter burst through the roof door - Carter trying to hold the bomb as far away from himself as possible. He looks over the side for a place to dump it - the streets are filled with PEOPLE AND CARS. 
LEE Wait!  There's people down there! 
CARTER There's people up here! 
LEE Get it out of here! 
CARTER Take it! 
Lee takes the bomb, quickly ROLLS IT across the roof -- Lee and Carter diving to the ground once again as the bomb slides to the center of the roof - COMING TO A STOP RIGHT IN FRONT OF ISABELLA.  She's wearing a bathrobe now, clearly pissed off as she slowly bends down and picks up the package. 
ISABELLA Get on your feet. 
Lee and Carter stand and face Isabella - watch as Isabella begins to open the package. 
CARTER I wouldn't do that!!! 
LEE It's a bomb. 
Isabella opens the package, removing a stack of a HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS. 
ISABELLA You see, no bomb.  Now stay away before I throw you both in jail for obstruction. 
CARTER Throw us in jail?  I'm about to bust you right now. 
ISABELLA I'm an undercover agent for the United States Secret Service. 
CARTER How do we know you're not lying?  Let me see your badge. 
Isabella opens her bathrobe -- WE SEE a small BADGE pinned to her bra. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Let me see it again? 
LEE We can help you.  I'm a detective in Hong Kong. 
ISABELLA I know who you are, Inspector Lee. 
LEE Then you know I'm not walking away from this case. 
CARTER Yeah, that's right. 
ISABELLA We need to get out of sight.  Come down to my suite. 
INT. ISABELLA'S SUITE - LATER 
ISABELLA (she locks the door) Look, I've been working this case for months now... 
CARTER So what's your story? 
ISABELLA They think I'm a crooked customs agent. 
Lee examines the stack of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS from Hu Li's package.  Carter checks out the suite, pocketing some of the food from the mini fridge. 
LEE Is this a payoff? 
ISABELLA No.  It's a sample.  You guys ever heard of the Superbill? 
CARTER It's a myth.  Some kind of counterfeit. 
ISABELLA It's much more than a counterfeit.  14 out of 15 world banks can't tell the difference.  The paper is Crane linen blend -- and the bills are printed on U.S. Intaglio presses. 
CARTER How're they getting into the U.S. Mint to use the presses? 
HU LI (in Chinese) The great Chief Inspector Lee -- I will be remembered for ridding the Triads of your petulance. 
Hu Li savors the moment. 
CARTER I hope you just said I have no business being here, 'cos I was just leaving. 
Carter starts to leave, and Hu Li trains her gun on him, freezing him in his tracks.  Isabella slowly walks several feet, ending up behind Lee as she speaks. 
ISABELLA Hu Li, I think there's someone who will want to talk to them first. 
Hu Li looks at Isabella, nods an acknowledgement.  BANG!  Lee falls.  Isabella's knocked him out from behind with the butt of her gun. 
BANG!  Carter drops to one knee as Hu Li POUNDS him across the jaw with her fist. 
CARTER ...oh, that's a filling right there. That's gonna cost you. 
Hu Li lunges forward and KICKS Carter, sending him backwards. 
HU LI Put them in the truck. 
The WORKERS pick up Lee, bring him to the back of the truck. 
CARTER I should kill you right now, but I'm gonna let you live, 'cause you're fine, and maybe you can be reformed. 
The WORKERS start towards Carter.  He holds up his hands. 
CARTER (CONT'D) No more hitting.  I'll get in the truck myself. 
As Carter walks towards the truck by Hu Li, they exchange a look of sheer hatred.  As soon as he passes by her, Hu Li COLDCOCKS Carter with her gun. 
EXT. LOADING DOCK PLATFORM - DAY 
The eighteen wheeler, the limo and the black Lincoln Town car pull out of the loading dock, headed for the highway. 
EXT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - DAY 
The truck pulls onto a HIGHWAY, the LIMO close behind it. 
INT. EIGHTEEN WHEELER - TRUCK BED - DAY 
LEE and CARTER are in the back with crates filled with MONEY. 
They're both in pain, trying to recover from the head blows. Carter is flexing his battered body. 
LEE Are you okay? 
CARTER What's the first thing I told you -- never trust nobody.  How could you fall for that shit?  I knew she was dirty. 
LEE She saved our lives. 
CARTER For how long?  Face it, Lee, she's playing both sides. 
Lee looks disappointed. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Look, man I'm sorry.  I know you got a thing for her. 
LEE Shhh, my head hurts. 
CARTER I'm about to be killed and you "Shhh" me!  This wasn't my case, Lee.  Ricky Tan didn't kill my father, the Fu-Cang Long are not in South Central.  I didn't have to help you. 
LEE Why did you help me? 
CARTER It doesn't matter. 
Lee thinks about this for a BEAT. 
LEE I'm not used to having a partner. 
CARTER As long as you're asking...I think you have a pretty good voice. 
LEE I knew it.  What does she know.  You want me to sing something? 
CARTER That depends.  How do the Fu-Cang-Long usually kill their victims? 
LEE They'll probably torture us first, shock our privates, then put two bullets in our eyes and one in the back of the head. 
CARTER Go ahead.  Sing your ass off. 
Lee clears his voice. 
LEE Did you happen to see the most beautiful girl in the world...and if you did, was she crying, crying...hey! 
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY 
The 18-WHEELER drives by followed by the LIMO. 
INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY 
Hu Li and Isabella sit in the back of one of the limos that is driving behind the truck.  Hu Li is on the car phone. 
HU LI Don't worry, the plates are safe.  Yes, the dragon's been fed. 
She HANGS UP and glances at Isabella, who is doing her best to appear completely uninterested. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY 
The LIMO splits off from the 18-WHEELER. 
INT. 18-WHEELER - TRUCK BED - CONTINUOUS 
Carter works at opening one of the crates.  Lee steps up, takes a deep breath, searches the crate looking for the sweet spot, and PUNCHES a hole in one of the thick boards.  They start prying the crate open. 
CARTER Very nice. 
LEE It's focus.  Every opponent has a weak spot.  You ignore everything around you, and put all your energy into one perfect strike. 
CARTER I'll remember that next time I'm fighting a box. 
Carter opens the crate -- it's filled with SUPERBILLS, about $1,000,000 worth.  He tosses a stack to Lee. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Hello, Benjamin. 
LEE Who's Benjamin? 
CARTER Benjamin Franklin, he discovered electricity. 
LEE A Chinese man discovered electricity. 
CARTER No Chinese man discovered electricity. 
LEE Yes he did.  He also invented the bicycle. 
CARTER Now that I believe. 
Carter pockets two stacks of superbills.  Lee looks at him. 
CARTER (CONT'D) You never know.  Besides, I always wanted to die rich. 
The truck lurches. 
LEE We're slowing down.  This must be it. 
CARTER End of the line. 
LEE You've been a good friend, James Carter. 
LEE Let's go. 
CARTER Wait a second.  We can't go in like this.  Look at this place, we gotta look fly.  We gotta Mac out. 
LEE What is Mac out? 
CARTER Follow me my Asian brother. 
Carter and Lee start to walk away. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Just stay down wind, because I think you stepped in some serious rat shit down there. 
EXT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - NIGHT 
Lee and Carter are walking into the upscale clothing store. 
INT. VERSACE BOUTIQUE - CONTINUOUS 
As they enter, a SALESMAN approaches them. 
SALESMAN May I help you gentlemen? 
Carter flashes his biggest smile as he pulls out a stack of superbills. 
CARTER Black.  42-long.  Nothing touches this body but pure silk.  And get my partner something from the children's department. 
Carter puts his hand on Lee's shoulder. 
SALESMAN Would your partner like silk as well?  I personally like it when a couple matches. 
Carter takes his hand off Lee's shoulder. 
CARTER Couple?  No, you got it wrong, there's no couple here.  Just two single police officers working a very dangerous case. 
LEE Yes.  We have lots of big men chasing us. 
SALESMAN I'm sure all the boys are chasing you two.  Don't worry, I'll make you guys the bell of the ball. 
He WINKS as he walks off, and Carter looks at Lee. 
CARTER This is the last time I go shopping with you. 
EXT. RED DRAGON - NIGHT 
Lee and Carter enter frame, dressed to kill - perfectly tailored couture Versace suits, gold watches, the whole bit. Le is awkward in "player" guise. 
CARTER (whispering) Remember, Lee, you're a player now.  You own the place. 
Carter pulls out his ALTOIDS, and he and Lee each take one as they walk through the doors. 
LEE I own the place. 
INT. RED DRAGON - CONTINUOUS 
Carter STRUTS through the lobby, Lee doing his best to imitate Carter's pimp and roll.  THEY WALK PAST THE GIANT BUDDHA -- 
CARTER That looks exactly like my Uncle Darrell. 
LEE Buddha is the symbol of luck and good fortune. 
CARTER Buddha is the symbol for fat and lazy. The man has the biggest tits in Asia. 
They are moving through the MAIN ENTRY HALL lined with TERRA COTTA CHINESE SOLDIERS - posed and dressed for battle. 
RICKSHAWS and BICYCLES take people through the hotel.  The MAIN CASINO is roped off and empty.  People crowded around the perimeter - a sign reads: 
SIGN $50,000 buy in -- EVERYBODY'S A WINNER! 
ISABELLA (CONT'D) Behind me is the soft count room.  We're pretty sure the plates are back there. 
LEE Why don't you go get them? 
ISABELLA If I'm wrong then my cover is blown. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
As Steven Reign makes his way through the casino, Carter steps right in front of him, giving him a big hug. 
CARTER Stevie, how's it going my man?  Somebody get a picture, we can use it for a mug shot. 
STEVEN REIGN Detective Carter, you always seem to show up where you don't belong. 
CARTER Lemme ask you something, Steven.  And I want the truth.  Is there any way I can date your daughter?  Just dinner and a movie, maybe go listen to some jazz... 
STEVEN REIGN Vegas has been my town for 30 years.  I crawled out from under the first rock. Do you really think you can intimidate me here? 
CARTER You're right, you're a smart guy.  Most counterfeiters only get ten cents on the dollar.  But this is an even swap.  Pure genius. 
STEVEN REIGN You play games with me, Detective, and you'll lose every time.  Don't forget. The odds are always in favor of the house. 
Reign walks off with his men.  Carter watches him leave. 
INT. DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT 
Lee is dancing close with Isabella. 
ISABELLA The Secret Service almost busted Reign at his casino in Macao, but the place burned down before we could move in. 
LEE How do I know I can trust you? 
ISABELLA Dip me! 
Lee dips her, holds her in his arms for a long BEAT. 
ISABELLA (CONT'D) I'm asking for real now -- will you help the Secret Service? 
LEE No. (beat) But I'll help you. 
Lee holds her for a long BEAT, their lips almost touching. He finally lets her go, and she disappears into the crowd. Carter walks up, sees Lee standing alone on the dance floor. 
CARTER Lee, what the hell are you doing? 
LEE Dancing? 
CARTER Dancing?  I'm out here trying to strong arm Steven Reign, putting my life on the line, and you're up here dancing with some bimbo.  Did she have a friend? 
LEE It was Isabella.  She says the plates are in the soft count room. 
Lee motions to the room, where WE SEE a SECURITY GUARD standing in front of a small door. 
CARTER Isabella?  Are you crazy, man?  She almost got us killed.  She's setting you up again! 
LEE No.  I'm going to find out. 
CARTER Wait a second.  There's guards all over the place.  You'll need a distraction. 
Carter looks around the casino. 
CARTER (CONT'D) I'll go to the craps table, make a big scene.  When security comes over, you make your move. 
LEE Try to keep them busy for five minutes. 
CARTER I'll give it my best shot. INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS 
Carter walks up to a CRAPS TABLE, everyone turning to stare. 
Hu Li WHIPS her KNIFE around, catches Isabella across the hand -- the GUN SLIDING across the room near the detonator -- the TWO WOMEN fight around it. 
Lee watches them almost step on it - dives to the floor and rolls toward the detonator.  He's about to grab it when: 
THE TRIADS OPEN THE DOOR 
They're about to move in. 
HU LI Get the detonator! 
The Triads go for the detonator -- as Lee gets to his feet, KICKS Hu Li's legs out from under her. 
One of the Triads about to pick up the detonator - but Lee gets to him first.  He fights with one hand tied behind his back. 
Hu Li and Isabella fight it out in the EYE IN THE SKY ROOM. 
Lee gets kicked towards the Eye In The Sky WINDOW. 
INT. CASINO - CASHIER 
Two security guards lead Carter away from the table when: 
CRASH! 
An AIRBORNE Lee rockets through the EYE IN THE SKY WINDOW. In a rain of glass, he lands HARD on the casino floor. 
The NOISE grabs everyone's attention, including: 
CARTER Lee!! 
The guards restrain him. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Lemme ask you something.  Any of you ever felt $500,000 before? 
He SLAMS THE RACK OF CHIPS ACROSS THEIR FACES -- chips flying as the GUARDS hit the floor. 
CARTER (CONT'D) Doesn't feel so good, does it? 
INT. EYE IN THE SKY ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Hu Li picks up the detonator.  WHACK!  A heeled foot kicks it from her grasp.  Isabella has recovered!  The detonator FLIES OUT THE BROKEN WINDOW. 
INT. CASINO - CONTINUOUS 
On his back, Lee watches the detonator SAIL OVER HIS HEAD AND DISAPPEAR into the crowd.  It lands on a DRINK CART.  Before Lee can get there, a WAITRESS changes trays and carries the detonator on her rounds. 
Panicked, Lee searches for the detonator.  He JUMPS atop a BLACKJACK TABLE to get a better vantage.  He can't see it, but he does see: 
ACROSS THE CASINO 
Carter on top of a CRAPS TABLE, keeping security guards at bay with a croupier stick. 
CARTER Black man gets on a hot streak and you're all trippin'? 
Carter and Lee see each other.  They have the same simultaneous though: 
CARTER (CONT'D) (help!) Lee! 
LEE (help!) MMMMMM!!!! 
Carter is Lee's only hope to get the bomb out of his mouth. But from here to there, a MASS OF PEOPLE.  The quickest way is the HIGH WAY. 
Lee leaps from TABLE to TABLE.  Scattering playing cards. Reaching the carpeted divide...Lee doesn't stop. He launches off the bent-over back of a high roller -- landing on a RICKSHAW, SURFING IT to the tables on the other side. 
Carter looks around for Lee, catches a glimpse of the Eye in the Sky Room.  He grins. 
CARTER Check it out.  Catfight! 
Hu Li SURVIVED the blast and Carter has turned to face her. 
CARTER (CONT'D) You go after Ricky.  I got this. 
LEE Carter... 
CARTER Just GO! 
Lee turns and runs off past the dragon.  Unfortunately, FIVE TRIADS block his path.  In a flurry of PUNCHES, Lee makes short work of them, and races toward the elevators. 
DEAD CENTER ON THE RED CARPET - HU LI AND CARTER FACE OFF! 
Each readying in their own manner.  Hu Li carefully wraps her long hair into a bun on top of her head.  Carter stretches, flexes, ready to sting like a bee. 
CARTER (CONT'D) I'm not gonna hold you back this time just because you're a woman.  I'm gonna pretend you're a man. 
She pulls off her jacket, prepares to fight him in her undershirt. 
CARTER (CONT'D) A very beautiful man with a perfect body who I'd like to take to the movies. 
She takes a sword from a Terra Cotta statue, SWINGS IT AROUND like a master. 
CARTER (CONT'D) I may have been absent the day we went over this in karate class. 
Quick, Carter reaches for a fighting stick off a Terra Cotta soldier.  WHOOSH!  She SLICES IT IN HALF.  Carter reaches for another.  SLICE!  She's toying with him. 
INT. ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT 
Lee's in the elevator as the doors close.  SUDDENLY, a HAND cuts through, parting the doors. 
It's ISABELLA!  A wound on her shoulder. 
LEE Are you okay? 
ISABELLA I'm fine. 
She steps in, too weak and starts to fall.  Lee grabs her and holds her in his arms.  HE gently helps her down. 
LEE I didn't know which side you were on. 
ISABELLA Now you know. 
DING!  The elevator doors open.  Isabella holds up a ROOM KEY - the key to the SUITE.  Lee takes the key, backs away and steps into the elevator. 
ISABELLA (CONT'D) I'll try to get backup.  Be careful. 
The elevator doors close. INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Steven Reign is closing the safe.  There are stacks of HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS on his desk, which he's putting in a black bag along with the plates.  As he turns around, he comes face-to-face with Ricky Tan. 
RICKY TAN American's love to gamble.  Don't they, Mr. Reign? 
STEVEN REIGN I'm cutting our deal short.  I'm leaving. 
RICKY TAN And my plates? 
STEVEN REIGN They stay with me.  I'm sure you won't have a problem with that. 
Reign shows Tan the gun in his belt.  Grabs the bag and starts to walk toward the door. 
RICKY TAN I enjoyed that little story you told about the Dragon and the treasure.  My mother used to tell it to me all the time.  Do you know the moral of that story, Mr. Reign? 
STEVEN REIGN Greed will imprison us all. 
Tan grabs Reign from behind and stabs him with a knife. 
RICKY TAN I hate that fortune cookie shit.

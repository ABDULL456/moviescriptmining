Story by Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush, Jim Reardon, Josie Trinidad, Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee 
IN BLACK -- 
We hear the feral, primeval sounds of a jungle at night. A timpani bangs an ominous beat. 
FADE IN ON: 
A JUNGLE - NIGHT 
A BUNNY nervously walks through the dark, foreboding forest, frightened by every shadow and moving leaf. 
YOUNG JUDY (V.O.) Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust! Thousands of years ago, these were the forces that ruled our world. A world where prey were scared of predators. And predators had an uncontrollable biological urge to maim and maul and... 
The timpani crescendos. A JAGUAR leaps out of the shadows, attacks the bunny, who screams-- 
CUT TO: 
INSIDE A BARN - A JUNGLE (SET) - NIGHT 
The action continues-- as imagined by an amateur stage production. 
YOUNG JUDY Blood, blood, blood! 
Reams of red papier mâché entrails ooze from the bunny. And when those run out-- projectile ketchup. 
Reveal: These are ANIMAL KID ACTORS. The bunny, JUDY HOPPS, 10, is our hero. And this is her play being staged. A banner reads: CARROT DAYS TALENT SHOW! 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) And death. 
The CROWD looks on, confused. The music goes discordant as BOBBY CATMULL, a bobcat, bangs a drum. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) Back then, the world was divided in two. Vicious predator or Meek prey. 
TWO BOXES drop down, labeled VICIOUS PREDATOR and MEEK PREY. The PREDATOR box lands on the jaguar. The MEEK PREY box lands on Judy. Her entrails get stuck outside the box. She drags them underneath with her. 
YOUNG JUDY (O.S.) (CONT'D) But over time, we evolved, and moved beyond our primitive savage ways. 
A YOUNG SHEEP wearing a white muumuu and a cardboard rainbow on his head does an improvisational dance across the stage. Judy and the jaguar burst out of their boxes, now wearing white muumuus, too. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) Now, predator and prey live in harmony. 
Judy and the jaguar shake hands as the sheep throws glitter. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities. 
ASTRONAUT SHEEP Yeah, I don't have to cower in a herd anymore. 
The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. She's wearing a homemade astronaut costume. 
ASTRONAUT SHEEP (CONT'D) Instead I can be an astronaut. 
Catmull plays a slide whistle. 
ACTUARY JAGUAR I don't have to be a lonely hunter any more. 
The Jaguar rips off his muumuu. He's dressed in a suit. 
ACTUARY Today I can hunt for tax exemptions. I'm gonna be an actuary! 
YOUNG JUDY And I can make the world a better place! I am going to be... 
Catmull plays a 70s-style cop show theme on the boom box. Judy rips off her muumuu, revealing a POLICE OFFICER UNIFORM. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) A police officer! 
Judy's parents, BONNIE & STU, look stunned. A mean fox kid, GIDEON GREY, snickers. He's sitting next to a WEASEL KID. 
GIDEON GREY Bunny cop. That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard. 
YOUNG JUDY It may seem impossible to small minds-- (points at Gideon) I'm looking at you Gideon Grey. 
GIDEON GREY Nice costume, loser. What crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop? 
YOUNG JUDY Kindly return my friends' tickets. 
Gideon pats the tickets in his pocket. 
GIDEON GREY Come and get `em.... But watch out, `cause I'm a fox-- and like you said in your dumb little stage play, us predators used to eat prey. And that killer instinct's still in our Dunnahh. 
TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID (sotto, to Gideon) Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced D-N-A. 
GIDEON GREY Don't tell me what I know, Travis. 
YOUNG JUDY You don't scare me, Gideon. 
Gideon shoves Judy. Hard. She falls. The other prey animals flee to safety behind a nearby tree, leaving her to face the thugs alone. 
GIDEON GREY You scared now? 
Judy starts to tear up. Her nose starts to twitch. 
TRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID Lookit her nose twitch. She is scared! 
GIDEON GREY Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry -- 
Suddenly-- BAM! Judy kicks Gideon in the face with her hind legs. He stumbles back, then checks his lip for blood. 
GIDEON GREY (CONT'D) Oh, you don't know when to quit, do ya? 
He unsheathes his claws like a switchblade, then slaps her, drawing blood from her cheek. She cowers, as do her scared friends behind the tree. 
GIDEON GREY (CONT'D) I want you to remember this moment-- the next time you think you will ever be anything more than just a stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny. 
Gideon and his pal head off, laughing and high-fiving. The prey animals run back over to Judy, who wipes the blood from her cheek. She fights tears, defeated. 
GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY That looks bad. 
SHARLA Are you okay, Judy? 
YOUNG JUDY Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay. 
Judy smiles and then whips out the tickets as she gets up. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) Here you go. 
SHARLA Wow! You got our tickets! 
GARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY You're awesome, Judy! 
SHARLA Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talkin' `bout. 
YOUNG JUDY Well, he was right about one thing... 
Judy picks up the cop hat, puts it on her head. 
YOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) I don't know when to quit. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. POLICE ACADEMY TRAINING FACILITY - DAY 
Hopps and the comparatively huge CADETS sit in a circle as MAJOR FRIEDKIN, an intimidating drill instructor, lectures. 
MAJOR FRIEDKIN Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems within its city limits-- Tundra Town, Sahara Square, Rainforest District, to name a few. You're gonna have to master all of them before you hit the streets-- or guess what? (to Hopps) You'll be dead! 
IN SAHARA SQUARE SIMULATOR: 
Hopps struggles through the sand. 
MAJOR FRIEDKIN(CONT'D) Scorching sandstorm. You're dead, bunny bumpkin! 
ON THE VINE-COVERED MONKEY BARS: 
Hopps swings across the bars, simulating the RAINFOREST DISTRICT. She falls off, landing face first in the mud. 
MAJOR FRIEDKIN (O.S.) (CONT'D) 1000 foot fall. You're dead, carrot face! 
TUNDRA TOWN ICE WALL: 
Judy can barely contain her glee. Her parents are in shock. 
BELLWETHER Congratulations, Officer Hopps. 
JUDY I won't let you down. This has been my dream since I was a kid. 
BELLWETHER Ya know, it's a... It's a real proud day for us little guys. 
LIONHEART Bellwether, make room will ya? Come on. 
Lionheart shoves Bellwether out of the way. 
LIONHEART (CONT'D) Okay, Officer Hopps. Let's see those teeth! 
A group of PHOTOGRAPHERS aim their cameras. Lionheart steps in front of Bellwether, edging her out of the photo. The flashbulbs pop. 
EXT. BUNNYBURROW TRAIN STATION - DAY 
Stu, Bonnie, and several SIBLINGS accompany Judy to the train station. 
BONNIE HOPPS We're real proud of you, Judy. 
STU HOPPS Yeah. Scared, too. 
BONNIE HOPPS Yes. 
STU HOPPS Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo. I mean, Zootopia. It's so far a away... It's such a big city. 
JUDY Guys-- I've been working for this my whole life. 
BONNIE HOPPS We know. And we're just a little excited for you, but terrified. 
JUDY The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. 
STU HOPPS And also bears. We have bears to fear, too. To say nothing of lions, and wolves... 
BONNIE HOPPS Wolves? 
STU HOPPS ...weasels... 
BONNIE HOPPS You play cribbage with a weasel. 
STU HOPPS And he cheats like there's no tomorrow. You know what, pretty much all predators-- and Zootopia's full of `em. 
BONNIE HOPPS (scolding) Oh, Stu. 
STU HOPPS And foxes are the worst. 
BONNIE HOPPS (retreating) Actually, your father does have a point there. It's in their biology. Remember what happened with Gideon Grey. 
JUDY When I was 9. Gideon Grey was a jerk, who happened to be a fox. I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks. 
STU HOPPS Sure. Yeah, we all do. Absolutely. But just in case, we made you a little care package to take with you. 
BONNIE HOPPS And I put some snacks in there. 
Stu begins pulling a bunch of PINK FOX DETERRENTS from a bag. 
STU HOPPS This is fox deterrent. 
BONNIE HOPPS Yeah that's safe to have there. 
STU HOPPS This is fox repellent... 
BONNIE HOPPS Okay, the deterrent and the repellent. That's all she needs. 
STU HOPPS Check this out! 
Stu removes a Fox Taser, fires it up. It sizzles. 
BONNIE HOPPS Oh for goodness sake. She has no need for a fox taser, Stu. 
STU HOPPS Oh c'mon. When is there not a need for a fox taser? 
JUDY Okay, look-- I will take this to make you stop talking. 
Judy grabs the pink fox repellent from the bag as the train pulls up. 
HOPPS Greasy walls... rickety bed... 
KUDU POOTOSSER (O.S.) Shut up! 
ORYX POOTOSSER (O.S.) You shut up! 
KUDU POOTOSSER (O.S.) No! You shut up! 
HOPPS Crazy neighbors... (big smile as she flops on the bed) I love it! 
As the shouting continues, she stretches out on her bed, exhausted but overjoyed. 
WAKE UP MONTAGE - MORNING 
Quick, rhythmic cuts of: 
- Alarm clock: Beep. Beep. Beep. 
- Dressing: Vest. Badge. Belt. 
On the bedside table sits the PINK FOX REPELLENT. Judy glances at it and smirks-- taking it would be silly-- she walks out of frame. HOLD on the table. One second. Then Judy's hand comes back into frame and grabs the Repellent. 
INT. ZOOTOPIA POLICE DEPARTMENT - MORNING 
Utter mayhem. COPS parade PERPS through the lobby-- one is wearing cuffs and a plastic (not scary) safety muzzle, he complains to the BEAR COP marching him by. 
LEOPARD C'mon! He bared his teeth first. 
We land at the front desk and find CLAWHAUSER, a PUDGY CHEETAH COP, happily eating a bowl of Lucky Chomps cereal. 
HOPPS (O.C.) Scuse me! Down here? Hi. 
Clawhauser leans over the desk to find Hopps. 
CLAWHAUSER O-M goodness! They really did hire a bunny. What?! (MORE) 
CLAWHAUSER (CONT'D) I gotta tell ya, you are even cuter than I thought you'd be. 
HOPPS (a little wince) Ooo, uh, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny "cute," but when other animals do it, it's a little... 
CLAWHAUSER (gasps, realizing) I am so sorry. Me, Benjamin Clawhauser, the guy everyone thinks is just a flabby, donut-loving cop, stereotyping you...? 
HOPPS It's okay-- oh, you've actually you've actually got a-- there's a-- in your neck-- the fold-- the-- there's-- 
Clawhauser removes a small donut from under some neck fat. 
CLAWHAUSER Oh, there you went, you little dickens! 
He crams the donut into his mouth. 
HOPPS (awkwardly laughing) I should get to roll call, so... which way do I? 
CLAWHAUSER Oh! Bullpen's over there to the left. 
HOPPS Great, thank you! 
Clawhauser watches admiringly as she heads to the bullpen. 
CLAWHAUSER (to himself, wistful) Aw... That poor little bunny's gonna get eaten alive. 
INT. ZPD - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS 
Hopps enters the bullpen, by far the smallest animal in the room: rhinos, buffalo, hippos, elephants, etc. Hopps holds her paw out to a tough RHINO, MCHORN. 
HOPPS Hey. Officer Hopps. You ready to make the world a better place? 
McHorn gives Hopps a reluctant fist bump, nearly knocking her off the chair. 
OFFICER HIGGINS (O.S.) TEN HUT! 
In walks CHIEF BOGO, a gruff CAPE BUFFALO. He takes the dais. Everyone snaps to attention and starts stomping the floor. 
BOGO All right, all right. Everybody sit. 
As Hopps sits, she disappears below the DESK that is meant for a rhino. 
BOGO (CONT'D) I've got three items on the docket. First... we need to acknowledge the elephant in the room. (nods to ELEPHANT) Francine, happy birthday. 
NICK Alright look, everyone comes to Zootopia thinking they can be anything they want. Well you can't. You can only be what you are. (points to himself) Sly fox. (MORE) 
NICK (CONT'D) (points to her) Dumb bunny. 
HOPPS I am NOT a dumb bunny. 
NICK Right. And that's not wet cement. 
She looks down. She's landed in wet cement. 
NICK (CONT'D) (as he goes) You'll never be a real cop. You're a cute meter maid though. Maybe a supervisor one day. Hang in there... 
INT. HOPPS'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - EVENING 
CLOSE ON HER WELCOME MAT: Hopps wipes off her cement covered feet. Then she enters 
THE APARTMENT -- 
Hopps turns on the radio. Everybody Hurts plays. She changes the station. A sadder song comes on. She changes the station repeatedly, each song progressively sadder. Finally, she lands on a treacly instrumental that will score the scene. 
She puts in a microwave dinner: CARROTS FOR ONE. Hopps takes her food (A SINGLE CARROT) and sits at a small table. 
Her phone rings. INSERT: MOM & DAD FACETIME. Hopps shakes her head, sighs, then puts on a fake smile and answers. 
HOPPS Oh hey, it's my parents! 
BONNIE HOPPS Aw there she is! Hi sweetheart! 
THE FACETIME cuts between Bonnie on her phone. Stu will pop in and out of frame. 
STU HOPPS Hey there, Jude the Dude! How was your first day on the force? 
HOPPS It was real great. 
BONNIE HOPPS Yeah? Everything you ever hoped? 
HOPPS Mmm. Absolutely. And more. Everyone's so nice. And I feel like I'm really making a difference-- 
STU HOPPS (pops head into frame) Hey, wait a second. Holy cripes, Bonnie! Look at that! 
BONNIE HOPPS (a discovery) Oh my sweet heaven-- Judy, are you a meter maid? 
Hopps is still wearing her vest, and her hat is on the chair. 
HOPPS (panicked) Oh this? No! Oh, no no! This is just a temporary thing-- 
BONNIE HOPPS It's the safest job on the force! 
STU HOPPS Ah, she's not a real cop! Our prayers have been answered! 
BONNIE HOPPS Glorious day! 
STU HOPPS Meter maid, meter maid! 
HOPPS Dad! Dad-- 
STU HOPPS Meter maid, meter maid! 
HOPPS DAD! You know what-- it's been a really long day, I should really-- 
BONNIE HOPPS That's right. You get some rest! 
STU HOPPS Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves. 
BONNIE HOPPS Bye bye! 
HOPPS (eye roll) Buh-bye. 
She hangs up, defeated. The SELF-PITYING MUSIC comes up full. 
ORYX POOTOSSER (O.S.) Hey Bunny! Turn down that depressing music! 
KUDU POOTOSSER (O.S.) Leave the meter maid alone! Didn't you hear her conversation? She feels like a failure! 
Judy turns off the music. 
ORYX POOTOSSER (O.S.) Oh, shut up! 
Resuming the chase, Hopps jumps off the building-- landing precariously in the midst of a large group of mice. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Oh! Oh, sorry! Coming through! `Scuse me! `Scuse me. Pardon... 
Hopps locates Weaselton, who's safely making his escape on the top of a tiny mouse train. 
DUKE WEASELTON Bon voyage, flat foot! 
But Hopps won't quit. She takes a short cut and knocks him off the train. Rodents scream and run amidst the chaos. 
HOPPS Hey! Stop right there! 
The Weasel throws an ornamental donut at Hopps. 
DUKE WEASELTON Have a donut, coppah! 
But the donut misses and rolls towards some SHREWS coming out of "Mousies." 
FRU FRU SHREW Ohmygawd, did you see those leopard print jeggings? (sees the donut about to kill her) Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! 
But at the last second... Hopps stops it! Deep breath... 
HOPPS I love your hair. 
FRU FRU SHREW Aw... thank you. 
Meanwhile, the Weasel spots the bag he was stealing and smugly picks it up, ready to leave. 
DUKE WEASELTON Come to papa... 
Then out of nowhere, Hopps dumps the donut on his head. 
INT. ZPD - LOBBY - A LITTLE LATER 
The lobby is overflowing with ANIMALS filing MISSING MAMMAL REPORTS. Clawhauser is dealing with an otter, MRS. OTTERTON. 
CLAWHAUSER Okay, you're gonna have to be patient and wait in line just like everyone else, Mrs. Otterton, okay? 
Just then: BAM! The Weasel (in donut) rolls through the front door and hits Clawhauser's desk. It settles, revealing Hopps. 
HOPPS I popped the weasel! 
Behind her, Chief Bogo yells from the second floor. 
BOGO HOPPS! 
INT. ZPD - BOGO'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER 
Hopps sits in a big chair in front of Bogo, like a kid in the principal's office. Bogo looks over a report. 
BOGO Abandoning your post, inciting a scurry, reckless endangerment of rodents... but to be fair, you did stop a master criminal from stealing two dozen... moldy onions. 
HOPPS Hate to disagree with you, sir, but those aren't onions. Those are a crocus varietal called Midnicampum Holicithias. They're a Class C Botanical, sir. I grew up in a family where plant husbandry was kind of a thing. 
BOGO Shut your tiny mouth, now. 
HOPPS Sir, I got the bad guy. That's my job. 
BOGO Your job is putting tickets on parked cars. 
CLAWHAUSER (INTERCOM) Chief, uh, Mrs. Otterton's here to see you again. 
BOGO Not now. 
CLAWHAUSER(INTERCOM) Okay, I just didn't know if you wanted to take it this time, she seems really upset-- 
BOGO Not now! 
HOPPS Sir, I don't want to be a meter maid... I wanna be a real cop. 
BOGO Do you think the Mayor asked what I wanted when he assigned you to me? 
HOPPS But sir, if you-- 
BOGO Life isn't some cartoon musical where you sing a little song and your insipid dreams magically come true. So let it go! 
MRS. OTTERTON barges in, with Clawhauser trailing, wheezing. 
Clawhauser places the Otterton file on his desk for Hopps. 
CLAWHAUSER Here ya go! One missing otter! 
Hopps opens the file. It's a single piece of paper. What? 
HOPPS That's it?! 
CLAWHAUSER Yikes! That is the smallest case file I've ever seen! Leads: none, witnesses: none-- and you're not in the computer system yet, so resources: none. (chuckles) I hope you didn't stake your career on cracking this one. 
Clawhauser takes a bite of his donut and the crumbs land on a picture in the file, drawing Hopps's attention to it. 
HOPPS Okay. (deep breath) "Last known sighting..." 
Hopps brushes away the crumbs, revealing a picture of Mr. Otterton on the street. Clawhauser annoyingly slurps from a soda bottle. Hopps squints at the picture, intrigued. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Can I just borrow-- (grabbing soda bottle) Thank you. 
Hopps uses Clawhauser's bottle to enlarge the picture. She sees Mr. Otterton holding a PAWPSICLE. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Pawpsicle. 
CLAWHAUSER The murder weapon! 
HOPPS Get your pawpsicle... 
CLAWHAUSER Yeah, `cause that... What does that mean? 
HOPPS It means I... have a lead. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - LATER 
We find Nick pushing a BABY STROLLER. HOPPS zooms up in her traffic cart, smiling. 
HOPPS Hi! Hello? It's me again! 
NICK Hey, it's Officer Toot Toot. 
HOPPS (fake laugh, humoring him) Ha-ha-ho, no actually it's Officer Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some questions about a case. 
NICK What happened, meter maid? Did someone steal a traffic cone? It wasn't me. 
Hopps looks ahead, Nick has gone around the corner. Hopps pulls in front of Nick and sounds her siren. 
NICK (CONT'D) Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby, I gotta get to work. 
HOPPS This is important, sir. I think your ten dollars worth of popsicles can wait. 
NICK I make 200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a year, since I was 12, and time is money, hop along. 
HOPPS Please, just look at the picture. 
Hopps holds up the traffic cam picture of the Otter. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle right? Do you know him? 
NICK I know everybody. And I also know that somewhere there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal, so why don't you get back to your box. 
Hopps' ears droop. 
HOPPS Fine. Then we'll have to do this the hard way. 
She puts a boot on the stroller. 
NICK Did you just boot my stroller? 
HOPPS Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest. 
NICK For what? Howting your feewings? 
HOPPS Felony tax evasion. 
Nick smile drops a bit. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Yeah. 200 dollars a day... 365 days a year... since you were 12, that's two decades, so times twenty... (calculating) (MORE) 
YAX THE HIPPIE YAK (CONT'D) As you can see, Nangi's an elephant, so she'll totally remember everything. Hey Nangi, these dudes have some questions about Emmitt the Otter. 
NANGI Who? 
YAX Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to your yoga class for like 6 years? 
NANGI I have no memory of this beaver. 
JUDY He's an otter actually. 
YAX He was here a couple Wednesdays ago. `Member? 
NANGI Nope. 
YAX Yeah, he was wearing a green cable- knit sweater vest, and new pair of corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real tight. Remember that Nangi? 
NANGI No. 
Nangi doesn't want to be bothered. And she's useless. Yax is a gold mine, though! Hopps writes down everything he says. 
YAX Yeah, and we both walked him out and he got into this big ol' white car with a silver trim? Needed a tune up. The third cylinder wasn't firing. `Member that, Nangi? 
NANGI Nope. 
HOPPS You didn't happen to catch the license plate number, did you? 
YAX Oh, for sure. It was 29THD03. 
HOPPS 0, 3... Wow, this is a lot of great info, thank you. 
YAX Told ya Nangi has a mind like a steel trap. I wish I had a memory like an elephant. 
EXT. SAHARA SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER 
Nick and Hopps emerge. 
NICK Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue. And seeing as how any moron can run a plate, I will take that pen and bid you adieu. 
As Nick reaches to take it, Hopps realizes something and leaves him hanging. 
HOPPS The plate... I can't run a plate... (frustrated grunt) I'm not in the system yet. 
NICK Give me the pen please. 
Hopps gets an idea... 
HOPPS (still withholding pen) What was it you said? "Any moron can run a plate?" Gosh... if only there were a moron around who were up to the task... 
NICK Rabbit, I did what you asked, you can't keep me on the hook forever. 
HOPPS Not forever. Why, I only have 36 hours left to solve this case. So can you run the plate or not? 
NICK Actually, I just remembered I have a pal at the DMV... 
EXT. DMV - LATER 
They arrive at the DMV, the "Department of Mammal Vehicles." 
NICK Flash is the fastest guy in there, you need something done, he's on it. 
HOPPS I hope so, we are really fighting the clock and every minute counts. (suddenly stops, alarmed) Wait. They're all sloths?! 
Unfortunately, every mammal working there is a... SLOTH. INSERT: SLOTH EMPLOYEES taking extraordinary amounts of time to do the simplest of tasks-- stapling, stamping, etc. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) You said this was going to be quick! 
NICK (faux innocence) What? Are you saying that because he's a sloth, he can't be fast? I thought in Zootopia anyone could be anything. 
Nick smiles. Hopps doesn't. They head to Flash's station. 
NICK (CONT'D) Flash, Flash, hundred yard dash! Buddy, it's nice to see ya. 
Flash doesn't respond. Beat. 
FLASH Nice to... (beat) (beat) see you... (beat) (beat) too. 
Hopps looks like she's going to die. 
FLASH Ha... ha... ha... ha... 
HOPPS Ha, ha, yes very funny, very funny, can we please just focus on the task-- 
Flash slowly reaches over to the sloth next to him. 
FLASH Hey... Priscilla... 
HOPPS Oh no! 
PRISCILLA Yes... Flash? 
FLASH What... do... 
HOPPS No! 
FLASH You call... a... 
HOPPS A three humped camel? Pregnant! Okay, great, we got it, please just- 
FLASH Three... humped... 
HOPPS Aggggggghhhhhhh-- 
INT. DMV - LATER 
A slow DOT-MATRIX printer spits out the address for CAR LICENSE PLATE NUMBER: 29THD03. 
FLASH Here... 
HOPPS Yeah, yeah, yeah... thank you! 
FLASH You... go. 
HOPPS (frantically reads) 29THD03-- it's registered to... Tundratown Limo Service? A limo took Otterton, and the limo's in Tundratown-- it's in Tundratown! 
NICK Way to hustle, bud. I love ya. I owe ya. 
HOPPS Hurry, we gotta beat the rush hour and-- 
EXT. DMV - CONTINUOUS 
They go outside. It's night. 
HOPPS IT'S NIGHT?! 
EXT. SNOWY LOT - MOMENTS LATER 
Nick and Hopps reach LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE CAR SERVICE. Hopps tries to open the lock. 
HOPPS Closed. Great. 
NICK Mm. And I will betcha you don't have a warrant to get in. Hm? Darn it. It's a bummer. 
There's a big gated parking lot which is chained shut... but they can see a few limos parking inside, covered in snow. 
HOPPS You wasted the day on purpose. 
NICK Madam, I have a fake badge. I would never impede your pretend investigation. 
HOPPS It's not a pretend investigation! Look, see-- (showing picture of Otterton) See him? This otter is missing. 
NICK Well then they should have gotten a real cop to find him. 
HOPPS What is your problem? Does seeing me fail somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life? 
Nick considers this for a moment. 
NICK It does. One hundred percent. (then) Now... since you're sans warrant, I guess we're done? 
Hopps considers this and sighs, defeated. 
HOPPS Fine. We are done. Here's your pen. 
Hopps then casually throws it over the fence behind her. 
NICK Hey! (staring at the pen) (MORE) 
Pull out to reveal the car passing through the security gate of a residential compound. A POLAR BEAR GUARD lets them in. 
INT. MR. BIG'S RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER 
Nick and Hopps are shoved into a room that's right out of The Godfather. A POLAR BEAR enters... 
HOPPS (sotto) Is that Mr. Big? 
NICK (sotto) No. 
Now an even BIGGER POLAR BEAR enters... 
HOPPS What about him? Is that him? 
NICK (sotto, frustrated) No. 
...and then another. The BIGGEST POLAR BEAR yet... 
HOPPS That's gotta be him. 
NICK Stop talking stop talking stop talking-- 
The huge polar bear growls at Nick, then reveals a tiny chair upon which sits... a TEENY, TINY ARCTIC SHREW... this is MR. BIG. He sounds like Marlon Brando sped up to 78 rpm. 
NICK (CONT'D) Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple misunder- 
Mr. Big holds out a TINY FINGER for NICK to KISS HIS RING. Nick painstakingly does so. 
NICK (CONT'D) This is a simple misunderstanding. 
Mr. Big motions for Nick to shut up. 
MR. BIG You come here unannounced... on the day my daughter is to be married? 
NICK Well actually we were brought here against our will, so... (Mr. Big is not impressed) Point is, I did not know it was your car, and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding. 
MR. BIG I trusted you, Nicky... I welcomed you into my home... we broke bread together... Gram-mama made you her cannoli. And how did you repay my generosity? With a rug... made from the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt rug. You disrespected me. You disrespected my gram-mama who I buried in that skunk butt rug. I told you never to show your face here again, but here you are, snooping around with this... (re. Hopps) What are you, a performer? What's with the costume? 
HOPPS Sir, I am a c-- 
NICK Mime! She is a mime. This mime, cannot speak. You can't speak if you're a mime. 
HOPPS No. I am a cop. And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case, and my evidence puts him in your car, so intimidate me all you want, I'm going to find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing I do. 
Mr. Big considers this and makes that little grunt. 
MR. BIG Then I have only one request: say hello to Gram-mama. Ice `em! 
The Polar Bears snatch Nick and Hopps. 
NICK Whoa-- I didn't see nothing-- I'm not saying nothing-- 
MR. BIG And you never will-- 
The polar bears open a hidden door on the floor, revealing an icy pool beneath. 
NICK Please! No no no! If you're mad at me about the rug I've got more rugs! 
Nick and Hopps are about to be dumped in, when-- 
FRU FRU SHREW Oh, Daddy, it's time for our dance. (sees them trying to kill Nick) What did we say? No icing anyone at my wedding! 
MR. BIG I have to, baby. Daddy has to. (to Thugs) Ice `em. 
Nick and Hopps scream and-- 
FRU FRU SHREW Wait. WAIT! She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday. From that giant donut. 
MR. BIG This bunny? 
FRU FRU SHREW Yeah. Hi! 
HOPPS Hi. (warm, whisper) I love your dress. 
FRU FRU SHREW Aw, thank you. 
Mr. Big motions for the Polar Bears to put Hopps down. 
The door creaks open just an inch. Nick and Hopps seem startled... Hopps slowly pushes the door open, revealing Manchas in the center of the room, hunched over and grunting. 
NICK Buddy? 
HOPPS Are you... okay? 
Hopps looks at Manchas. 
RAAAGH!!! Manchas turns, right at them. His eyes are dilated, he's turned savage! He's poised to pounce on Nick and Hopps. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Run. RUN! 
The Jaguar tears after them, he's deranged, primal. Nick and Hopps run! The jaguar is closing in. 
NICK What is wrong with him?! 
HOPPS I don't know!! 
Nick and Hopps run across the bridge. Manchas closes in. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Jump! 
They jump off the bridge to a lower branch. They duck into a hollow log and Manchas follows them. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) (to Nick) Head down! 
Hopps frantically picks up her police radio. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Officer Hopps to dispatch! 
INT. POLICE STATION - DISPATCH - SAME 
We find Clawhauser showing a handcuffed PERP a video on his phone of pop star Gazelle singing and dancing. A RED LIGHT blinks on the desk phone, but Clawhauser ignores it. 
CLAWHAUSER Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest singer of our lifetime-- angel with horns-- okay, hold on, keep watching. Who's that beside her? Who is it? 
Reveal: Clawhauser is dancing on stage with Gazelle. 
GAZELLE (ON PHONE) Wow, you are one hot dancer... (digitized robo-voice) ...BENJAMIN CLAWHAUSER. 
CLAWHAUSER (joyous laughter) It's me! Did you think it was real? It looks so real! It's not. It's just a new app. (finally notices ringing phone) Hold on a second-- 
Clawhauser clicks the speaker button and-- 
HOPPS (V.O.) CLAWHAUSER! Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                  62. 
EXT. THE CANOPY - SAME 
RAAGH! Manchas takes a swipe at Nick. 
HOPPS Clawhauser, listen to me! We have a 10-91! Jaguar gone savage! Vine and Tu-junja! 
NICK It's Tujunga! 
As they emerge from the log, Hopps slips, dropping her radio. 
CLAWHAUSER (ON RADIO) Okay, we're sending back up! Hopps? HOPPS?! 
Nick and Hopps run, sliding around a corner. Ahead is a gondola station. 
HOPPS There! Head to the skytrams! 
They run to the gondolas. Hopps darts out of Manchas' way, but slips and is headed off the platform when she manages to grab on-- dangling from the edge. Nick searches for her... 
NICK Get in! Carrots? Carrots! 
He tries to hold on to the gondola for Hopps, who is struggling to pull herself back onto the platform. 
HOPPS Go! 
As the gondola pulls away, Nick tries to stop it to no avail. 
NICK No, no, no! 
Nick backs up... the jaguar stalks him. 
NICK (CONT'D) Buddy, one predator to another--                      * 
Nick guides Hopps to a PASSING GONDOLA, motioning her in. 
NICK (CONT'D) Officer Hopps? 
The gondola pulls away, leaving Bogo and the rest of the police watching, flabbergasted. 
INT./EXT. GONDOLA - CONTINUOUS 
Hopps and Nick both stare straight ahead. 
HOPPS Thank you. 
NICK Never let `em see that they get to you. 
Hopps looks at Nick, a little surprised. Nick looks out. 
HOPPS So, things do get to you... 
NICK No... I mean, not anymore. But I was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once. 
HOPPS Har-har. 
NICK (retreating into the memory) No, it's true. I think was 8, or maybe 9, and all I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. YOUNG NICK'S BEDROOM - DUSK (FLASHBACK) 
YOUNG NICK, tiny and cherubic, looks in the mirror. We see MOTHER's paws tying the scout kerchief around his neck. 
NICK (V.O.) ...so, my mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand new uniform because, by God, I was gonna fit in. 
EXT. SCOUT BUILDING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) 
Young Nick bounds down the sidewalk and up the stairs. 
NICK (V.O.) Even if I was the only predator in the troop-- 
INT. SCOUT MEETING - MOMENTS LATER (FLASHBACK) 
Young Nick enters a church basement, spots a GROUP OF PREY KIDS, all in scout uniforms. They wave him over. 
NICK (V.O.)(CONT'D) ...the only fox. 
MEAN KID ANIMAL (O.S.) Okay, Nick! 
NICK (V.O.) I was gonna be part of a pack. 
MEAN KID ANIMAL Ready for initiation? 
YOUNG NICK Yeah! Pretty much born ready. 
They high five Nick. It looks promising and fun. 
NICK (V.O.) I was so proud. 
Suddenly, a BIG KID turns off the lights. Other KIDS switch on FLASHLIGHTS, shining them on Nick like gestapo spotlights. 
MEAN KID ANIMAL Okay. Now raise your right hand and deliver the oath. 
YOUNG NICK I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave, loyal, helpful, and trustworthy. 
MEAN KID ANIMAL Even though you're a fox? 
YOUNG NICK What? 
Then, a bunch of KID ANIMALS tackle Nick. Soon, all of the animals pile on, kicking and shoving him. 
YOUNG NICK (CONT'D) No! What did I do wrong, you guys?! No! Please tell me, what did I do wrong?! 
With Nick pinned, the primary mean kid straddles him. Someone hands him a MUZZLE. The mean kid snaps it on Nick's snout. 
YOUNG NICK (CONT'D) (muzzled) What did I do?! 
MEAN KID ANIMAL If you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle, you're even dumber than you look. 
Nick breaks free from the kids. Scrambles away from them in fright. As they laugh, he races out the door. 
Judy swats Nick, but accidentally hits Bellwether's puff. 
BELLWETHER Where to? 
HOPPS Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga. 
ANGLE ON the computer screen. 
BELLWETHER There! Traffic cams for the whole city. This is so exciting, actually. Well, you know, I never get to do anything this important. 
HOPPS But you're the Assistant Mayor of Zootopia. 
BELLWETHER Oh, I'm more of a glorified secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote... (then, cheerily) But he did give me that nice mug. 
She motions to a mug that reads World's Greatest Dad Assistant Mayor. 
BELLWETHER (CONT'D) Feels good to be appreciated. 
LIONHEART (INTERCOM) Smellwether?! 
Bellwether cringes. 
BELLWETHER That's a fun little name he likes to use. I called him Lionfart once. He did not care for that, let me tell you. It was not a good day for me. (pressing intercom button) Yes, sir? 
LIONHEART (INTERCOM) I thought you were going to cancel my afternoon?! 
BELLWETHER Oh, dear. I better go -- (to Hopps, while leaving) Let me know what you find. It was really nice for me to be-- 
LIONHEART (INTERCOM) While we're young, Smellwether! 
Bellwether finally opens her big heavy door and leaves. 
NICK You think when she goes to sleep she counts herself? 
HOPPS Shush. Okay, traffic cams... (looking at computer) Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in. 
Nick and Hopps watch the footage from the night before. We can see the jaguar going nuts. Then a BLACK VAN skids up, and some WOLVES hop out. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Who are these guys? 
NICK Timberwolves. Look at these dumdums. 
The Wolves suddenly capture the jaguar with a net. Judy GASPS, shocked. Nick is unfazed. 
NICK (CONT'D) Betcha a nickel one of em's gonna howl. 
The wolves howl... 
NICK (CONT'D) And there it is. What is it with wolves and the howling? It's like-- 
HOPPS (light-bulb moment) Howlers! Night howlers! That's what Manchas was afraid of... wolves! The wolves are the night howlers. If they took Manchas... 
NICK ...I bet they took Otterton too. 
HOPPS All we gotta do is find out where they went. 
She clicks the monitor... but as the wolves drive off, they disappear through a tunnel and don't come out the other side. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Wait. Where'd they go? 
NICK You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal-- which I never have-- I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B... which would put them out... 
He clicks on another camera. Nothing... then... the wolves emerge in the van. 
NICK (CONT'D) ...right there. 
Hopps looks at Nick, impressed. 
HOPPS Well, look at you, Junior Detective. You know, I think you'd actually make a pretty good cop. 
NICK How dare you. 
Hopps goes back to clicking... we track the wolves through alleys and back roads. 
NICK (CONT'D) Acacia alley... Ficus underpass... South Canyon... 
HOPPS They're heading out of town... Where does that road go? 
HOPPS Yes. What I mean is, thousands of years ago... um... predators survived through their aggressive hunting instincts. For whatever reason, they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. 
Nick doesn't like what he's hearing. 
REPORTER (O.S.) Of course they did. 
Nick looks at the posters of the muzzled animals and shakes his head, disbelieving. FLASH BACK to his memory of being muzzled as a child. 
MEAN KID ANIMAL (V.O.) (during flashback) Aw, is he gonna cry. 
REPORTER (O.S.) (on Nick, as flashback ends) Officer Hopps, could it happen again? 
HOPPS It is possible. So we must be vigilant. And we at the ZPD are prepared and are here to protect you... 
This sends the Press into an absolute frenzy. 
PRESS Will more mammals go savage? / What is being done to protect us? / Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators? 
Bellwether steps in, eager to put an end to the questions. 
BELLWETHER Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh, that's all the time that we have. No more questions... 
Bellwether ushers Hopps off stage. 
HOPPS Was I okay? 
BELLWETHER Oh, you did fine. 
Hopps walks across the lobby to Nick, completely unaware that she just started a controversy. 
HOPPS (excited) That went so fast! I didn't get a chance to mention you or say anything about how we-- 
NICK (upset) Oh, I think you said plenty. 
HOPPS What do you mean? 
NICK (sarcastic, hard) Clearly, there's a biological component? These predators may be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. Are you serious? 
HOPPS I just stated the facts of the case. I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage... 
NICK Right. But a fox could? Huh? 
HOPPS Nick, stop it. You're not like them. 
NICK Oh, there's a them now? 
HOPPS You know what I mean. You're not that kind of predator. 
NICK The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around Fox Repellent? 
Hopps sighs guiltily. 
NICK (CONT'D) Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met. (escalating anger) So let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me? (Hopps looks heartbroken) Do you think I might go nuts? Do you think I might go savage? Do you think I might try to... EAT YOU?! 
He lunges, like he's going to bite her. She flinches and unthinkingly puts her hand on the repellent. 
NICK (CONT'D) (calm, hurt) ...I knew it. Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me... 
He shoves the application at her. 
NICK (CONT'D) Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner. 
As he walks away, he takes off the sticker badge, crumples it and tosses it away. 
HOPPS No. Nick. Nick! 
REPORTER 5 Officer Hopps! Were you just threatened by that predator? 
HOPPS No. He's my friend. 
REPORTER 6 We can't even trust our own friends? 
HOPPS That is not what I said! Please! 
REPORTERS Are we safe? / Have any other foxes gone savage? 
But no one will listen. Not anymore. 
Hopps looks at the pamphlet. Bellwether sits across from her at her desk. 
HOPPS Um... I don't understand. 
BELLWETHER Our city is 90% prey, Judy. And right now they're just really scared. You're a hero to them. They trust you. And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD. 
Bogo sits next to Hopps. She looks at the pamphlet again. 
HOPPS (struggling to find words) I'm not... I'm not a hero. I came here to make the world a better place, but I think I broke it. 
BOGO Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps. The world has always been broken. That's why we need good cops-- like you. 
HOPPS With all due respect, sir, a good cop is supposed to serve and protect-- help the city. Not tear it apart. (deep sigh) I don't deserve this badge. 
She removes her badge... 
BOGO Hopps. 
BELLWETHER Judy, you've worked so hard to get here. It's what you've wanted since you were a kid. You can't quit... 
HOPPS Thank you for the opportunity. 
Hopps sets her badge on the desk and walks out. Bellwether and Bogo look at one another in shock and concern. 
FADE OUT. 
EXT. HOPPS' FARMS VEGETABLE STAND - DAY 
Hopps, with a thousand yard stare, works the carrot stand. She wraps some carrots in a newspaper-- Headline: GROWING UNREST DIVIDES CITY-- and hands them to a RABBIT FAMILY. 
HOPPS A dozen carrots. 
RABBIT MOM Thanks! 
HOPPS Have a nice day. 
RABBIT MOM (to daughter) Come on. 
Hopps reads the paper as Stu and Bonnie approach, concerned. 
STU HOPPS Hey there, Jude-- Jude the dude, remember that one? How we doin? 
HOPPS. I'm fine. 
BONNIE HOPPS You are not fine. Your ears are droopy. 
Hopps remains fixed on the newspaper and lets out a sigh. 
HOPPS Why did I think I could make a difference? 
STU HOPPS Because you're a trier, that's why. 
BONNIE HOPPS You've always been a trier. 
HOPPS Oh, I tried. And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators. 
Off-screen, BEEP-BEEP. 
STU HOPPS Oh, not all of them, though. Speak of the devil. Right on time. 
A truck pulls up. Its sign reads: GIDEON GREY'S GOOD BAKED STUFF... With Fresh Produce From Hopps Family Farms. 
HOPPS Is that... Gideon Grey? 
STU HOPPS Yep. It sure is. We work with him now. 
BONNIE HOPPS He's our partner. And we never would have considered it had you not opened our minds. 
STU HOPPS That's right. I mean, Gid's turned into one of the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows. 
HOPPS That's really cool, you guys. 
GIDEON GREY, now paunchy, climbs out his truck. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Gideon Grey. I'll be darned. 
ADULT GIDEON GREY Hey Judy-- I'd like to say I'm sorry for the way I behaved in my youth. I had a lotta self-doubt that manifested itself in the form of unchecked rage and aggression. I was a major jerk. 
Hopps cocks her head. Huh? Nick turns to her... holding her recording pen. 
NICK Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you erase it... in 48 hours. 
Hopps sniffles and wipes a tear from her eye. 
NICK (CONT'D) Alright, get in here. 
Hopps leans her head on Nick's chest. He gives her a hug. 
NICK (CONT'D) Okay. Oh, you bunnies... You're so emotional. There we go. Deep breath. (then) Are you just trying to steal the pen. Is that what this is? (then) You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off, off. 
HOPPS I'm sorry. 
INT. HOPPS' FAMILY TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER 
Hopps drives as Nick sits shotgun-- eating blueberries. 
NICK I thought you guys only grew carrots. (then, eats) What's the plan? 
HOPPS We are gonna follow the night howlers. 
NICK Okay. How? 
HOPPS (shows picture of weasel) Know this guy? 
NICK Uh-huh. I told you, I know everybody. 
EXT. ZOOTOPIA STREET - LATER 
We find the weasel selling crappy knock-off merchandise on a street corner. 
DUKE WEASELTON Well, hello, step right up! Anything you need... I got it. All your favorite movies! I got movies that haven't even been released yet! 
An ARMADILLO CUSTOMER scans an array of blatant knock-off movies like "Wreck-it Rhino," "Wrangled," and "Pig Hero 6." 
DUKE WEASELTON (CONT'D) Hey, 15% off! 20! Make me an offer! Come on! 
NICK (suddenly appearing) Well, well, look who it is. The duke of bootleg. 
DUKE WEASELTON What's it to you, Wilde? Shouldn't you be melting down a popsicle or something? (sees Hopps) Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy. 
HOPPS We both know those weren't moldy onions I caught you stealing. What were you gonna do with those night howlers, Wessleton? 
DUKE WEASELTON It's Weaselton. Duke Weaselton. And I ain't talking, rabbit. And ain't nothing you can do to make me. 
Weaselton flicks a toothpick in her face. Hopps smiles at Nick. 
INT. MR. BIG'S PLACE - A LITTLE LATER 
We find polar bears holding the weasel over the ice pit. 
MR. BIG Ice `em. 
DUKE WEASELTON Aaagh! Agh! (to Nick) Ya dirty rat! Why ya helping her?! She's a cop! 
MR. BIG And the godmother to my future granddaughter. 
Reveal: FRU FRU is pregnant. 
FRU FRU SHREW I'm gonna name her Judy. 
HOPPS Aw. 
MR. BIG (to polar bears) Ice this weasel. 
DUKE WEASELTON All right, all right, please! I'll talk! I'll talk. I stole them night howlers so I could sell `em. They offered me what I couldn't refuse... Money. 
HOPPS And to whom did you sell them? 
DUKE WEASELTON (PRE-LAP) A ram named Doug. We got a drop spot underground... 
EXT. SUBWAY STATION - A LITTLE LATER 
Nick and Hopps approach an abandoned subway station. 
DUKE WEASELTON (V.O.) ...Just watch it. Doug is the opposite of friendly. He's unfriendly... 
INT. SUBWAY CAR - SAME 
Nick and Hopps race away, feeling fairly confident. 
NICK Mission accomplished. Would it be premature for me to do a little victory toot-toot? 
HOPPS All right. One toot-toot. 
Nick blows the train whistle. 
NICK Well, I can cross that off the bucket list. 
Things are looking up, when: 
BAM! Woolter just busted into the car. Nick slams the door closed right before Woolter gets to them. 
NICK (CONT'D) I may have to rescind that victory toot-toot. 
Noise from the roof above them... BAM! BAM! BAM! 
NICK (CONT'D) Maybe that's just hail? 
Uh-oh. Jesse busts through the window. He's stuck, but flailing at Hopps. Nick tries to pull him away. 
NICK (CONT'D) Back off! 
Nick gets punched backward and notices Woolter charging toward the door at full speed. Right before Woolter arrives, Nick pulls the door open. 
NICK (CONT'D) Incoming! 
Woolter's momentum carries him into Jesse-- dislodging him onto the tracks. Hopps is knocked out the window, but grabs onto Woolter's horn. Hopps tries to hang on as the subway car hurtles down the tunnel. 
NICK (CONT'D) Carrots?! 
HOPPS (to Nick) Don't stop! Keep going! 
JESSE (about to get run over) No! No! Please stop! 
HOPPS Do not stop this car! 
Jesse dives to safety and Hopps gets bucked up onto the top of the train. Nick takes the wheel as the train emerges above ground. Hopps looks up to see... Another train coming toward them... on the same track! She sees a turn-off switch ahead. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Speed up, Nick! Speed up! 
NICK (staving off Woolter) There's another train coming! 
HOPPS Trust me! SPEED! UP! 
Woolter sees the train coming and tries to get unstuck, but he can't. He struggles like crazy. 
WOOLTER Stop the train! Hey! 
Then, at the last second, Hopps appears next to him: 
HOPPS Hey. Need some help? 
Hopps kicks Woolter off the train and he lands perfectly on the turn-off switch on the tracks below. At the last possible second, their train switches tracks-- just avoiding the oncoming car. 
Except... 
NICK Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast! Hold on! 
The train derails as it takes the curve. The night howlers catch fire. 
NICK (CONT'D) I think this is our stop! 
Hopps and Nick dive out of the car and onto a subway platform... Just as the lab car EXPLODES. 
HOPPS Okay... Maybe some of the evidence survived. 
A second loud EXPLOSION. The train is destroyed. 
HOPPS (CONT'D) Everything is gone. We've lost it all. 
NICK (shaking head) Yeah. Oh, except for this. 
Nick holds up a case-- containing a gun and a pellet.
